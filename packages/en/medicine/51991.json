I was thus\r\nurged on to ever fresh efforts, not only in the discovery of prosthetic\r\nappliances and other objects of ancient dentistry, but in the study,\r\nas well, of dental literature and of all the written matter that might\r\nthrow light on dentistry in past ages.\r\n\r\nThis subject has already occupied many before me, and each one has\r\nbrought to it his contribution of greater or less value, some in the\r\nform of short pamphlets, others in that of larger works.\r\n\r\nThe end I proposed to myself was to write a History of Dentistry which\r\nshould be much more complete, more circumstantial, and more exact than\r\nthose published hitherto, and which, instead of being, as are many of\r\nthese works, simply a compilation, should represent, at least in part,\r\nthe fruits of personal research and scrupulous examination of a vast\r\nnumber of works of various kinds containing elements utilizable for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe first part of my work, which I now offer to the public, comprises\r\nthe remote origin of Dentistry and its development throughout the ages\r\nas far as the end of the eighteenth century. In a short time I hope to\r\npublish the second part of it, viz., the History of Dentistry during\r\nthe last hundred years.\r\n\r\nI have carefully collected the greatest possible number of historical\r\ndata, keeping in view the consideration that some facts, although of\r\nlittle value in themselves, may possess a certain importance for the\r\nstudent desirous of procuring historical information relating to some\r\nparticular point of dental science.\r\n\r\nIf this book should, as I hope it may, contribute to the diffusion of\r\nexact historical knowledge as to the origin and gradual development of\r\ndentistry, my labor will not have been lost, for it will have realized\r\nthe object, a highly practical one, which has guided me in writing it.\r\n\r\n  VINCENZO GUERINI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I.\r\n\r\n  FIRST PERIOD—ANTIQUITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  DENTAL ART AMONG THE EGYPTIANS                                       19\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE HEBREWS                                                          32\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  DENTISTRY AMONG THE CHINESE                                          34\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  CUSTOMS RELATING TO THE TEETH AMONG DIFFERENT PRIMITIVE PEOPLES      42\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  THE GREEKS                                                           45\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  DENTAL ART AMONG THE ETRUSCANS                                       67\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  THE ROMANS                                                           77\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II.\r\n\r\n  SECOND PERIOD—THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  THE ARABIANS                                                        121\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  THIRTEENTH TO FIFTEENTH CENTURIES                                   140\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART III.\r\n\r\n  THIRD PERIOD—MODERN TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY                                               161\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n  THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY                                             218\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n  THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY                                              255\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery dentist who has ever given any thought to the development of his\r\nprofession must have realized the growing necessity for an accessible\r\nand authoritative history of the dental art. The early efforts in\r\nthis direction by Duval, Fitch, Carabelli, Snell, Linderer, Harris,\r\nand others, followed in this country by the more recent essays of\r\nPerine, Dexter, and Cigrand, are out of print and difficult to obtain.\r\nThe _Geschichte der Zahnheilkunde_, by Geist-Jacobi, and _Notice\r\nsur l’Histoire de l’Art Dentaire_, by Lemerle, have given to the\r\npractitioners of Germany and France valuable information which the\r\nEnglish-speaking dentist has often sadly lacked.\r\n\r\nRealizing this situation, at the first meeting of the National Dental\r\nAssociation, the late Dr. R. Finley Hunt offered the resolution: “That\r\na Committee of Three be appointed by the President to report at the\r\nnext annual meeting a measure looking to the preparation of a _full\r\nhistory_ of the Dental Profession.” After a careful consideration of\r\nthe subject, this committee reluctantly concluded that, “whereas a\r\ncomplete history of dentistry may some day be the result of the effort\r\nnow being made, this Association must confine its first attempts to\r\nthe history of dentistry in America.” In a letter to the committee\r\nthe late Dr. W. D. Miller said: “Of course, a universal history of\r\ndentistry would be very interesting and valuable, but its compilation\r\nwould naturally cost an immense amount of labor.” Aside from this, it\r\ndid not seem possible that the data for a proper history of the early\r\ndevelopment of the dental art in Africa and Europe could be collected\r\nby an association working in America.\r\n\r\nAfter several years of what may have seemed a policy of masterly\r\ninactivity the unexpected happened, and the committee was able to\r\nreport at the Buffalo meeting of the Association that Dr. Vincenzo\r\nGuerini, of Naples, Italy, had written a history of dentistry from\r\nthe earliest times to the beginning of the nineteenth century, and\r\nthat this work, translated into English and fully revised, had been\r\ngenerously placed in the hands of the committee for publication under\r\nthe auspices of the National Dental Association, in token of the\r\ndistinguished author’s appreciation of American dental development.\r\n\r\nThe Association, deeply sensible of this high compliment, and fully\r\nrealizing this opportunity for accomplishing a purpose which had\r\nhitherto seemed impossible, gladly arranged for the publication of\r\nthe book. After the delay incidental to the production of a work of\r\nthis character, and the necessary subscribers being obtained, this\r\nexhaustive history of early dentistry, by the greatest authority on\r\nthat subject in the world, is presented for the serious consideration\r\nof the thoughtful and studious members of the profession.\r\n\r\nDr. Guerini has spent many years of his professional life and large\r\namounts of money in collecting the material for this work. Our\r\nhistorical records are scattered through a vast literature, and much\r\nof it is of great antiquity, and it has never before been gathered\r\ntogether and arranged in such a consecutive, logical order.\r\n\r\nThe importance and value of dental art and science as a humane service\r\nare well recognized, but we are so accustomed to view the question from\r\nthe modern standpoint that we, generally speaking, overlook the immense\r\nwork done by our predecessors reaching far back in unbroken line to the\r\nmists of antiquity. It was they who laid the foundations upon which\r\nmodern dentistry has been built, and no man can peruse the record of\r\ntheir efforts as set forth in Dr. Guerini’s book without developing a\r\nhigher appreciation of their work and a keener realization of the worth\r\nand dignity of the calling which they in common with ourselves followed.\r\n\r\nIt has been deemed wise to make a few amendments and commentaries, and\r\nwhen that has been done the amendment has in each case been inserted as\r\na foot-note and designated by the initials of the commentator.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the work while passing through the press and the\r\ncorrection of proofs have been entrusted to Dr. Edward C. Kirk, of the\r\nCommittee; the index has been prepared by the chairman.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES MCMANUS, D.D.S.,\r\n  _Chairman of Committee on History of Dentistry,\r\n  National Dental Association, U. S. A._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HISTORY OF DENTISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nFIRST PERIOD—ANTIQUITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first beginnings of dental art were undoubtedly the same as those\r\nof general medicine, for it is evident that in primitive times, when\r\nthe healing art was still in its rudimentary stage, no divisions could\r\nhave existed in it.\r\n\r\nScientific medicine, whose most ancient representative is Hippocrates,\r\nwas preceded for the course of many centuries by sacerdotal medicine\r\nand by popular medicine.\r\n\r\nNecessity, instinct, and even mere chance must have taught primitive\r\nman some simple curative practices, in the same manner that they taught\r\nhim gradually to prepare his food and to satisfy the other wants of\r\nlife. It was in this way that popular medicine, which is found without\r\nexception among all races and is perhaps as ancient as man himself, had\r\nits earliest beginning.\r\n\r\nAs regards sacerdotal medicine, it was principally derived from the\r\nfalse ideas prevalent among primitive peoples about the causes of\r\nmaladies. When, for example, an individual in full health was seized\r\nwith sudden illness, no one could imagine, in those times of profound\r\nignorance, that this happened in a natural manner; the fact was\r\ntherefore attributed to a supernatural cause, that is, to his having\r\nbeen stricken by the wrath of some divinity. In this state of things\r\nit was believed to be absolutely necessary to propitiate the inimical\r\nor vengeful divinity, so that the patient might be restored to health.\r\nIt was, therefore, very natural that the intervention of sacerdotal\r\naid should be sought, that is, of the supposed intermediaries between\r\nhuman beings and the gods. The priests, on their side, were ready to\r\noccupy themselves with such cases, for their services were always well\r\nrecompensed, and, added to this, if the patient recovered, the respect\r\nand veneration of the people for the sacerdotal caste was considerably\r\nincreased, whilst if he did not, this simply meant that he or his\r\nfamily was not worthy of receiving the desired pardon, or that, anyhow,\r\nthe Divinity, for good reasons of his own, would not grant it.\r\n\r\nHowever, it being to the interest of the priests to obtain the greatest\r\npossible number of cures, they did not limit themselves merely to\r\noffering up prayers and sacrifices and to imposing on the patients the\r\npurification of themselves and other religious exercises; they also\r\nput into practice—always to the accompaniment of ritualistic words and\r\nceremonies—the means of cure which their own experience and that of\r\nothers suggested to them. The art of healing the sick was transmitted\r\nfrom generation to generation in the sacerdotal caste, acquiring an\r\never greater development and complexity in proportion to the making of\r\nnew observations and fresh experiences. It is to be understood that in\r\nthis manner the priests became more and more skilful in the treatment\r\nof disease; they were really the doctors of those times, albeit their\r\ncurative practices were mixed up with an ample dose of imposture. This,\r\nat least in many cases, must have had, besides, the advantage of acting\r\nfavorably on the patients by means of suggestion.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Herodotus that the Babylonians used to carry the sick\r\ninto the public squares; the passers-by were expected to make inquiries\r\nas to their illnesses, and if it so happened that they or any of their\r\nacquaintances had been similarly afflicted, to come to the aid of\r\nthe patient by offering their advice and making known the means of\r\ntreatment that had effected recovery, exhorting him, at the same time,\r\nto have recourse to them.\r\n\r\nThis usage had without doubt its advantages, as it must have led,\r\nlittle by little, to the recognition of such remedies as were most\r\nefficacious, among all those recommended, against the various maladies.\r\n\r\nAnother custom that served to furnish useful elements for the\r\ndevelopment of the art of medicine was that of the votive tables, hung\r\nin the temples by patients after their recovery, in sign of gratitude\r\nfor having received the invoked blessings. These tables contained a\r\nbrief description of the malady and of the treatment that had proved\r\nuseful in dispelling it. If we reflect that dental affections are often\r\nof long duration and very tormenting, the thought naturally suggests\r\nitself that among the votive tables not a few must have referred to\r\nmaladies of the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe numberless cases recorded by votive tables afforded precious\r\nclinical material, which without doubt was utilized in a great measure\r\nby the priests in compiling the earliest medical writings, and, as we\r\nshall see later, Hippocrates himself stored up all the medical records\r\nexisting in the celebrated temple of Cos.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Introduction of Ebers’ Papyrus, transcribed in Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphic characters._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nDENTAL ART AMONG THE EGYPTIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the people of ancient times, the Egyptian nation was, without\r\ndoubt, the one in which civilization first took its rise and had its\r\nearliest development. From the time of Menes, first King of Egypt (3892\r\nB.C.), the inhabitants of the valley of the Nile were well advanced on\r\nthe path of civilization, and under the fourth dynasty, dating from\r\n3427 years before the Christian era, they had already attained a high\r\ndegree of progress.\r\n\r\nMedical art and science in every country have always progressed in\r\nproportion to the general civilization, for the treatment of disease is\r\none of the first and most important manifestations of civilized life.\r\nIt is therefore natural that the healing art should have flourished\r\nearlier in Egypt than elsewhere, that is, in the midst of the oldest\r\ncivilized people.\r\n\r\nThere, as in other countries, medicine was practised for some time only\r\nby the sacerdotal caste; but not all the members of this caste were\r\ndoctors and priests at one and the same time; there was a special class\r\namong them, called “pastophori,” whose mission it was to cure the sick.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of medicine as practised among the Egyptians of old is\r\nnow no longer limited to the scanty notices handed down to us by Greek\r\nand Roman writers. The researches made by students of Egyptian lore\r\nhave placed original medical writings in our hands, now already partly\r\ninterpreted, that permit us to form a sufficiently exact idea of the\r\nscience of Medicine in ancient Egypt.\r\n\r\nThese valuable documents, denominated papyri, from the material on\r\nwhich they are written, now exist in great numbers in the Berlin\r\nMuseum, in the British Museum, and in those of Leyden, Turin, Paris,\r\nand other cities; but the most important of the papyri treating of\r\nmedical subjects is certainly the papyrus of Ebers, in the library of\r\nthe Leipzig University.[1] This very valuable papyrus—the most ancient\r\nof all known works on Medicine—is the best written of all the Egyptian\r\nmedical papyri, and is also the best preserved and most voluminous.\r\nIn size it is 30 centimeters high, 20 meters long, and the whole text\r\nis divided into 108 sections or pages, each one of about 20 to 22\r\nlines. The celebrated Egyptian scholar, Prof. George Ebers, procured\r\nit, toward the beginning of the year 1873, from an inhabitant of\r\nLuxor, in Upper Egypt. He published a beautiful edition of it two years\r\nlater in Leipzig; and in 1890 Dr. Heinrich Joachim published a German\r\ntranslation of the whole papyrus, with an introduction and explanatory\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\nThe Ebers’ papyrus is written in hieratic characters. We here reproduce\r\nsome passages of it, so as to give our readers an idea of the style of\r\nwriting.[2]\r\n\r\nLepsius and with him the greater part of Egyptologists are of opinion\r\nthat the Ebers’ papyrus is not an original work at all, but simply a\r\ncopy of medical writings of still earlier date, belonging to different\r\nepochs, and which were collected and reunited to form a kind of manual\r\non medicine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1\r\n\r\nPart of Ebers’ papyrus in Egyptian hieratic characters containing three\r\ndental prescriptions.]\r\n\r\nFrom some indications existing in the papyrus itself, Ebers has been\r\nable to argue, with quasi certainty, that the papyrus was written\r\ntoward the year 1550 B.C. But some parts of it have their origin in a\r\nfar more remote epoch; they go back, that is, to thirty-seven centuries\r\nor more before the Christian era. In fact, at page ciii of the Ebers’\r\npapyrus[3] one reads:\r\n\r\n“Beginning of the book about the treatment of the _uxedu_ in all the\r\nmembers of a person, such as was found in a writing under the feet of\r\nthe God Anubis, in the city of Letopolis; it was brought to His Majesty\r\nUsaphais, King of Upper and Lower Egypt.” Now, as Joachim remarks,\r\nthe Usaphais herein named was the fifth king of the first Egyptian\r\ndynasty, and he reigned toward 3700 before the Christian era. Hence, it\r\nmay be argued that some, at least, of the writings from which the Ebers’\r\npapyrus was taken were composed in the very remote epoch to which we\r\nhave just alluded, or perhaps still farther, for it is impossible to\r\nknow whether the book, deposited by unknown hands at the foot of the\r\nstatue of the God Anubis, had been written but a short time previous or\r\nat a much earlier epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2\r\n\r\nPart of Ebers’ papyrus in Egyptian hieratic characters containing\r\neleven dental prescriptions.]\r\n\r\nDental and gingival maladies are in no way neglected in the Ebers’\r\npapyrus. At page 72, a remedy is prescribed “against the throbbing of\r\nthe _bennut_ blister in the teeth,” then two other remedies “to cure\r\nthe _bennut_ blisters in the teeth and to strengthen the flesh (gum).”\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to say what is meant by _bennut_ blisters; but\r\nperhaps it means small, gingival abscesses of dental origin. The first\r\nof the above remedies—probably meant to calm the pricking or throbbing\r\npain that, in such cases, often accompanies the dental malady—consisted\r\nof:\r\n\r\n  “Seps-grains                           Part 1\r\n   Dough                                   ”  1\r\n   Honey                                   ”  1\r\n   Oil                                     ”  1\r\n  To be applied on the part as a plaster.”\r\n\r\nThe other two remedies, very likely intended for the cure of dental\r\nfistulæ, were to be used as masticatories. The first consists of:\r\n\r\n  “Fennel seeds    Part 1\r\n   Dough             ”  1\r\n   Anest-plant       ”  1\r\n   Honey             ”  1\r\n   Incense           ”  1\r\n   Water             ”  1”\r\n\r\nThe other was still more complicated and thus compounded:\r\n\r\n  “Dâm-plant       Part 1\r\n   Anest-plant       ”  1\r\n   Incense           ”  1\r\n   Amaa-plant        ”  1\r\n   Man-plant         ”  1\r\n   Saffron           ”  1\r\n   Aloe wood         ”  1\r\n   Annek-plant       ”  1\r\n   Cyperus           ”  1\r\n   Onion             ”  1\r\n   Water             ”  1”\r\n\r\nAt page 89 of the papyrus[4] we find two other remedies, having the\r\nsame object, that is, “to cure the bennut blisters in the teeth and to\r\nstrengthen the flesh.”\r\n\r\nThe first is compounded in this way:\r\n\r\n  “Cow’s milk                                             Part 1\r\n   Fresh dates                                              ”  1\r\n   Uah corn                                                 ”  1\r\n  To be left stand and then to be masticated nine times.”\r\n\r\nThis is the second receipt:\r\n\r\n  “Anest-plant                        Part 1\r\n   Dough                                ”  1\r\n   Green lead                           ”  1\r\n   Sebests[5]                           ”  1\r\n   Cake                                 ”  1\r\n   Dâm-plant                            ”  1\r\n   Fennel seeds                         ”  1\r\n   Olive oil                            ”  1\r\n   Water                                ”  1\r\n  To be used like the preceding one.”\r\n\r\nIn this same page 89 many other remedies corresponding to various\r\nindications are prescribed.\r\n\r\n  “To strengthen the teeth:\r\n\r\n   Powder of the fruit of the dum-palm      Part 1\r\n   Green lead                                 ”  1\r\n   Honey                                      ”  1\r\n  To be mixed and the teeth rubbed with it.”\r\n\r\nThe following is another remedy for the same purpose:\r\n\r\n  “Powder of flint stones       Part 1\r\n   Green lead                     ”  1\r\n   Honey                          ”  1\r\n  To be rubbed on the teeth.”\r\n\r\nNext comes a remedy “to cure the growth of _uxedu_ in the teeth,” that\r\nis:\r\n\r\n  “Dough      Part 1\r\n   Beans        ”  1\r\n   Honey        ”  1\r\n   Verdigris    ”  1\r\n   Green lead   ”  1\r\n  To be powdered, mixed, and applied on the teeth.”\r\n\r\nThe word _uxedu_ recurs more than thirty-five times in the Ebers’\r\npapyrus, in relation to affections of the most different parts of the\r\nbody. By confronting all the passages of the papyrus in which one finds\r\nthe word _uxedu_, Joachim deduces that it does not indicate any special\r\ndisease, but has the general signification of “a painful swelling.”\r\nAccording to Geist-Jacobi, by “growth of the uxedu in the teeth” may\r\nbe understood an alveolar abscess and the consequent swelling of the\r\nsurrounding parts.\r\n\r\nAnother remedy is intended for “the cure of the tooth that gnaws unto\r\nthe upper part of the flesh.”\r\n\r\nThe translator of the papyrus remarks that by the “upper part of the\r\nflesh” is to be understood the gum. The remedy would, therefore,\r\ncorrespond to the indication of curing a tooth “that gnaws or gives\r\npain unto the gum.” But as one sees, even putting it in these words,\r\nthe meaning is anything but clear. Perhaps the destructive action of\r\nthe carious process, reaching as far as the gum, is what is here meant\r\nto be alluded to. Meanwhile here is the receipt:\r\n\r\n  “Cumin       Part 1\r\n   Incense       ”  1\r\n   Onion         ”  1\r\n  To be reduced to a paste, and applied on the tooth.”\r\n\r\nBesides the remedies already given, the two following are prescribed\r\nfor strengthening the teeth:\r\n\r\n  “Incense                    Part 1\r\n  Verdigris                     ”  1\r\n  Green lead                    ”  1\r\n\r\n  Mix and apply on the tooth.”\r\n\r\nThe other is compounded of:\r\n\r\n  “Water                Part 1\r\n   Absinth                ”  1\r\n  To be used as above.”\r\n\r\nWe next find a formula, preceded by this very vague indication:\r\n“Chewing remedy for curing the teeth.”\r\n\r\n  “Amaa-plant       Part 1\r\n   Sweet beer         ”  1\r\n   Sut-plant          ”  1\r\n  To be masticated and then spit on the ground.”\r\n\r\nAnother masticatory is intended to “strengthen and cure the teeth,” and\r\nis compounded thus:\r\n\r\n  “Saffron        Part 1\r\n  Duat-plant        ”  1\r\n  Sweet beer        ”  1\r\n\r\n  To be masticated and then spit on the ground.”\r\n\r\nFinally, we have a medicament “for curing the gnawing of the blood in\r\nthe tooth.” It is complicated enough, being compounded with:\r\n\r\n  “The fruit of the gebu       Part 1/32\r\n   Onion                         ”  1/64\r\n   Cake                          ”  1/16\r\n   Dough                         ”  1/8\r\n   Anest-plant                   ”  1/32\r\n   Water                         ”  1/2\r\n  One leaves it to stand and then chews for four days.”\r\n\r\nBut what meaning is to be attributed to the “gnawing of the blood in\r\nthe tooth?”\r\n\r\nIt is almost certain that this figurative expression referred to the\r\npain deriving from caries and pulpitis. It may have had its origin in\r\nthe observation of two phenomena, that is, first of all, the pulsating\r\ncharacter which the pain alluded to often assumes, and the eventual\r\nissuing of blood from the cavity of a tooth affected by caries and\r\npulpitis, when the pulp is exposed. At any rate, the Egyptian doctors\r\nof remotest antiquity undoubtedly did not ignore the presence of blood\r\nin the interior of the tooth.\r\n\r\nFrom what we have related, it clearly appears that at that remote epoch\r\nmany remedies were already in use for combating dental affections.\r\nThese must consequently have been frequent enough, which demonstrates\r\nthe erroneousness of the opinion held by some, who affirm, as does\r\nMummery,[6] that in ancient times diseases of the teeth were extremely\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nBesides this, it is fully evident, from the Ebers’ papyrus, that at the\r\ntime in which this was written, dental pathology and therapy were still\r\nin a very primitive condition, and formed a part of general medicine,\r\nfrom which they showed as yet no tendency to separate; so true is\r\nthis, that the remedies intended for the treatment of the teeth do not\r\nconstitute a special section of the work, but are to be found among\r\nmedicaments of an altogether different nature. Thus, at page lxxii of\r\nthe papyrus[7] we find, first, three remedies against the itch; then\r\nfive remedies for the cure of pustules in various parts of the body;\r\nnext an ointment and a potion for the _bennut blisters_ in whatever\r\npart of the body they may occur; after this, three medicaments against\r\nthe _bennut blisters_ of the teeth; and lastly, a plaster for curing\r\ncrusts and itching in whatsoever part of the body.\r\n\r\nOne finds no mention of dental surgery in the Ebers’ papyrus. No\r\nconclusions could be drawn from this fact if the work only spoke of\r\nmedical treatment, for then it might reasonably be supposed that the\r\ncompiler had purposely occupied himself with this subject only; but, on\r\nthe contrary, the Ebers’ papyrus frequently makes mention of operative\r\ninterventions, and among these, of the use of the knife and of the\r\nred-hot iron for the treatment of abscesses and of certain tumors.\r\nTherefore, there being no mention made in the papyrus of any dental\r\noperation, not even of extraction, gives us reason to suspect that at\r\nthat remote epoch no surgical operation was carried out on the teeth,\r\nand that, as yet, no instruments existed for practising extraction.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the celebrated historian Herodotus, of Halicarnassus,\r\nwho lived in the fifth century previous to the Christian era (about\r\nfrom 500 to 424 B.C.), that is, more than a thousand years after\r\nthe time in which the Ebers’ papyrus was written, the dental art in\r\nEgypt had made remarkable progress, and was exercised by specialists.\r\nIn fact, in the second book of Herodotus we find the following\r\npassage: “The exercise of medicine is regulated and divided amongst\r\nthe Egyptians in such a manner that special doctors are deputed to\r\nthe curing of every kind of infirmity; and no doctor would ever lend\r\nhimself to the treatment of different maladies. Thus, Egypt is quite\r\nfull of doctors: those for the eyes; those for the head; some for the\r\nteeth; others for the belly; or for occult maladies.”[8]\r\n\r\nHaving here had occasion to refer to the _History_ of Herodotus, we\r\nwill quote two passages of this famous work, which have a certain\r\ninterest for our subject;\r\n\r\n“Whilst the tyrant Hippias, after having been driven out of Athens (510\r\nB.C.), was marching against Greece at the head of the Persian army and\r\nhad already arrived at Marathon, he happened one day to sneeze and to\r\ncough in a more vehement manner than usual; and he being already an\r\nold man, and his teeth all shaking, a violent fit of coughing suddenly\r\ndrove one of them out of his mouth, and it having fallen into the dust,\r\nHippias set to work, with great diligence, to search for it; but the\r\ntooth not coming to light, he drew a long sigh, and then said, turning\r\nto those who were standing by: ‘This land is not ours, neither shall we\r\never be able to have it in our power; what clings to my tooth is all of\r\nit that will ever belong to me.’”[9]\r\n\r\nIn another part of the _History_, that is, in the ninth book, Herodotus\r\nrecounts as follows:\r\n\r\n“When the corpses buried after the battle of Platea were already\r\ndespoiled of their flesh, a curious fact was seen; for the people of\r\nPlatea having collected the bones of those who had perished, there\r\nwas found amongst them a skull altogether devoid of commissures, and\r\ncomposed of one single bone. A jaw was also found, the teeth of which,\r\ncomprising the molars, appeared to be made all of one piece, as though\r\ncomposed of a single bone.”\r\n\r\nRelative to this last passage of Herodotus, we may remark, as does\r\nStark, that the total synostosis of the skull bones is certainly very\r\nrare, but that, nevertheless, one has authentic examples of the same,\r\nnot only in ancient but also in relatively modern times, witness the\r\nfamous skull of Albrecht von Brandenburg, surnamed the German Achilles,\r\nwho died in 1486, and was buried in the monastery of Heilbronn. As to\r\nteeth united together and forming a single piece, no example exists\r\nsave in very ancient authors, for instance, in Valerius Maximus, who\r\nrecounts a similar marvellous fact of Prusia, King of Bithynia, and in\r\nPlutarch, who attests to a similar fact in the person of Pyrrhus, King\r\nof Epirus.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to establish within what limits the activity\r\nof the dentists alluded to by Herodotus was displayed. It has been\r\naffirmed by some that dental art in ancient Egypt was very far\r\nadvanced, and that not only the application of artificial teeth, and\r\neven of pivot teeth, but also stoppings, were practised by the Egyptian\r\ndentists of those days. Here are some data on this subject:\r\n\r\nJoseph Linderer[10] tells us that, according to Belzoni[11] and others,\r\nartificial teeth made of wood and very roughly fashioned have been\r\nfound in Egyptian sarcophagi.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Perine, a dentist of New York, in an article on the history\r\nof dentistry,[12] says: “Both filled and artificial teeth have been\r\nfound in the mouths of mummies, the cavities in the former stopped with\r\ngold and in some cases with gilded wood. Whether these fillings were\r\ninserted during life for the purpose of preserving the teeth, or after\r\ndeath for ornamentation, it is, of course, impossible to say. That the\r\nEgyptians were exceedingly fond of embellishing their persons with\r\ngold ornaments and bright colored materials is a fact which has been\r\nclearly established, and the discovery of mummies—of exalted personages\r\nno doubt—some organs of which were gilded and embellished with showy\r\ncolors proves that their fondness for display accompanied them even\r\nto the grave.” To this may be added, that after an embalmment of the\r\nhighest class[13] it was usual to gild the eyebrows, the point of the\r\nnose, the lips, and the teeth of the corpse, and place a gold coin\r\nbetween the teeth, or cover over the tongue with a thin gold plate.\r\n\r\nDr. J. G. Van Marter, a dentist in Rome, in an article on prehistoric\r\ndentistry,[14] writes, among other things, that _the renowned\r\narchæologist, Mr. Forbes, had seen mummies’ teeth stopped with gold_.\r\n\r\nThe great defect of all the assertions referred to is that of not being\r\naccompanied by any element of proof, wherewith to demonstrate their\r\ntruth. When, for example, we are told that Mr. Purland possesses, in\r\nhis collection of antiquities, a tooth pivoted on to the root of a\r\nmummy’s tooth, the question suggests itself naturally: If this tooth\r\nis, as it appears, separated from the jaw of the mummy to which it is\r\nsaid to have belonged, how can we be certain that the tooth itself is\r\nreally that of a mummy? Until sufficient proof of this be furnished, we\r\ncannot but consider the above assertion as absolutely without value.[15]\r\n\r\nThe same may be said as to the assertions of Wilkinson and Forbes with\r\nregard to mummies’ teeth stopped with gold. Where and by whom were\r\nthese mummies found? And where are they preserved? Was the stopping,\r\ntoo, verified at the time of the finding of the mummy, in such a manner\r\nas to exclude all possibility of fraud, or was it discovered afterward,\r\nin circumstances such as to suggest the possibility of a mistification?\r\nIt has, in fact, been reported[16] that the pretended Egyptian stopping\r\nin a mummy existing in an English museum was nothing else than a\r\npractical joke, carried out, besides, in a very awkward manner.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to the above assertions, we have the most absolute\r\ncontradictory statements on the part of the most competent authorities.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Egyptologist, Prof. George Ebers, has only been able, in\r\nspite of the most accurate research, to arrive at completely negative\r\nresults in all that has reference to the dental art of the ancient\r\nEgyptians.[17]\r\n\r\nThe distinguished craniologist Prof. Emil Schmidt, of Leipzig, who\r\nowns a collection of several hundred mummies’ skulls, writes thus on\r\nthe question now before us: “In no jaw have I ever found anything that\r\ncould be attributed to the work of dentists: no fillings, no filing or\r\ntrepanning of teeth, no prosthesis.”[18] Virchow, who also examined\r\na great many Egyptian skulls, among which were several belonging to\r\nroyal mummies, did not find any indications of dentists’ work;[19] and\r\nMummery, as well, although he made the most conscientious researches on\r\nthis subject, could not arrive at any positive results whatever.[20]\r\n\r\nBetween the affirmations of some and the negations of others, it is\r\nvery difficult to say on which side the truth lies. For my own part,\r\nI fail to find that there is the least proof of the ancient Egyptians\r\nhaving known how to insert gold fillings and still less to apply\r\npivot teeth. But at the same time I think it cannot be doubted that\r\nthe Egyptian dentists knew how to apply artificial teeth. And even\r\nthough it may not be possible to demonstrate this by direct proof,\r\none is equally prone to admit it when one considers, on the one hand,\r\nthe remarkable ability of the ancient Egyptians in all plastic arts,\r\nand, on the other hand, the great importance they attributed to the\r\nbeautifying of the human body; so much so, that even in so ancient\r\na document as the Ebers’ papyrus, one finds formulæ for medicaments\r\nagainst baldness, for lotions for the hair, and other kinds of\r\ncosmetics. Is it likely, therefore, that so refined and ingenious a\r\npeople should not have found the means of remedying the deformity\r\nresulting from the loss of one or more front teeth?\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, we are not bound to content ourselves with simple\r\nsuppositions, for a well-authenticated archæological discovery made\r\nin the month of May, 1862, has put us in possession of an irrefutable\r\nproof.\r\n\r\nThe discovery to which we allude is registered in Renan’s _Mission de\r\nPhénicie_, and was the result of researches made in the necropolis of\r\nSaida (the ancient Sidon) by Dr. Gaillardot, Renan’s colleague in his\r\nimportant scientific mission. In a grave in one of the most ancient\r\nparts of the necropolis, Dr. Gaillardot found, in the midst of the sand\r\nthat filled the grave, a quantity of small objects, among which were\r\ntwo copper coins, an iron ring, a vase of most graceful outline, a\r\nscarab, twelve very small statuettes of majolica representing Egyptian\r\ndivinities, which probably formed a necklace, to judge by the holes\r\nbored in them. But among the objects found (which, together with that\r\nwe are about to mention, are now in the Louvre at Paris), the most\r\nimportant of all is “a part of the upper jaw of a woman, with the two\r\ncanines and the four incisors united together with gold wire;[21] two\r\nof the incisors would appear to have belonged to another individual,\r\nand to have been applied as substitutes for lost teeth. This piece,\r\ndiscovered in one of the most ancient tombs of the necropolis, proves\r\nthat dental art in Sidon was sufficiently advanced.”[22]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3\r\n\r\nPhœnician appliance found at Sidon, as represented in a cut of Renan’s\r\nMission de Phénicie.]\r\n\r\nTo these words, literally translated from Renan’s work, we will only\r\nadd the following considerations:\r\n\r\nEgypt was, in its time, a great centre of civilization, whose influence\r\nwas strongly predominant in all the neighboring region, and especially\r\nin ancient Phœnicia and in its large and industrious cities Tyre and\r\nSidon. The remains discovered in many of the Phœnician tombs would of\r\nthemselves alone be sufficient to demonstrate luminously the enormous\r\ninfluence exercised by the Egyptian civilization on the life and\r\ncustoms of that people. Now, if there were dentists in Sidon capable of\r\napplying false teeth, it may reasonably be admitted that the dentists\r\nof the great Egyptian metropoli Thebes and Memphis were able to do as\r\nmuch and more, the level of civilization being without doubt higher\r\nthere than in Tyre or in Sidon, or in other non-Egyptian cities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE HEBREWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Hebrew literature, as principally represented by the Bible\r\nand by the Talmud, there does not exist any book on medicine.\r\nNotwithstanding the vicinity and the close relations of the Hebrews\r\nwith Egypt, medical science never reached the degree of development\r\namong this people that it did in the land of the Pharaohs.\r\n\r\nIn the Bible we do not find the least trace of dental medicine or\r\ndental surgery. Indeed, although the books of Moses contain a great\r\nnumber of exceedingly wise hygienic precepts, there are not any that\r\nrefer directly to the teeth or to the mouth. We may therefore conclude,\r\nwith a certain degree of probability, that the Hebrews had in general\r\ngood teeth and that dental affections were very rare among them.\r\n\r\nThe word _tooth_ or _teeth_ occurs in the Bible more than fifty\r\ntimes,[23] but very few of the passages in which it is to be met with\r\npresent any interest so far as our subject is concerned.\r\n\r\nThat the Hebrews attached great importance to the integrity of the\r\ndental apparatus is plainly seen from the following verses of the book\r\nof Exodus (xxi: 23 to 27):\r\n\r\n23. ... thou shalt give life for life,\r\n\r\n24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\r\n\r\n25. Burning for burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.\r\n\r\n26. And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid,\r\nthat it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye’s sake.\r\n\r\n27. And if he smite out his manservant’s tooth or his maidservant’s\r\ntooth; he shall let him go free for his tooth’s sake.\r\n\r\nThese legislative measures show clearly enough that among the Hebrews\r\nthe loss of a tooth was considered a lesion of great gravity, as they\r\nthought it of sufficient importance to be named in the same category as\r\nthe loss of an eye, of a hand, or of a foot. If anyone caused the loss\r\nof an eye or of a tooth to his servant, the punishment was the same\r\nin both cases; that is, he was obliged to give him his liberty, thus\r\nundergoing the loss of his purchase money.\r\n\r\nBeauty and whiteness of the teeth were also in great repute. Thus we\r\nread in the Song of Solomon (iv: 2):\r\n\r\n“Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came\r\nup from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren\r\namong them.”\r\n\r\nIn another part of the Song (vi: 6) he repeats these same words,\r\nthus giving it to be understood how great was his admiration for the\r\nbeautiful teeth of his beloved.\r\n\r\nFrom various passages of the Bible, one perceives that integrity and\r\nsoundness of the teeth was considered a prime element of force and\r\nvigor. In Psalm iii: 7 David says: “Arise, O Lord; save me, O my God:\r\nfor thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast\r\nbroken the teeth of the ungodly.” (That is, reduced them to impotence.)\r\nAnd in Psalm viii: 6 we read: “Break their teeth, O God, in their\r\nmouth.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, in one of the Proverbs of Solomon (xxv: 19), broken\r\nor decayed teeth are taken to symbolize weakness: “Confidence in an\r\nunfaithful man in time of trouble is like a broken tooth, and a foot\r\nout of joint.” (In the Latin translation, instead of “broken tooth”\r\nstands “dens putridus.” Perhaps the corresponding expression in the\r\nHebrew language, signifies in a general sense a decayed or injured\r\ntooth.)\r\n\r\nThe uncomfortable sensation produced on the teeth by acid substances\r\n(teeth on edge) is to be found several times alluded to in the Bible.\r\nIn the Book of Proverbs (x: 26), one reads: “As vinegar to the teeth,\r\nand as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.”\r\nAnd Jeremiah says (xxxi: 29, 30): “In those days they shall say no\r\nmore, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children’s teeth are\r\nset on edge. But every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man\r\nthat eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge.”\r\n\r\nAs is apparent, there is nothing in the passages quoted that can be in\r\nany way connected with the treatment of dental affections; neither is\r\nit to be wondered at, when one reflects that even in the Talmud—which\r\nis much less ancient—medicine in general is hardly at all spoken of.\r\nThis famous code as to practical life is almost silent with regard\r\nto therapeutic medicine, and only recommends hygienic practices. An\r\naxiom of the Rabbi Banaah is worthy of note, and may be quoted here as\r\nbearing on the subject, and also because many Christians might be found\r\nto conform willingly thereto:\r\n\r\n“Wine is the best of all remedies; and it is in places where wine is\r\nwanting that one is in need of pharmaceutic remedies.”[24]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nDENTISTRY AMONG THE CHINESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor above 4000 years science and religion among the Chinese, as well\r\nas their customs, have remained quite unchanged. The inhabitants of\r\nthe Celestial Empire can vaunt a most ancient civilization; which is,\r\nhowever, altogether stationary; neither has their medicine made any\r\nprogress, and its actual state represents with sufficient exactness\r\nwhat it was in primitive ages.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, various works have been written about the medicine of the\r\nChinese, one of the best being that of Dabry,[25] taken from the most\r\ncelebrated medical books of China,[26] and which may be considered as a\r\ncompendium of the medical science of this people.\r\n\r\nIn this work we find two chapters relating to our specialty: the first\r\nof these (p. 286) speaks of toothache, the second (p. 292) treats of\r\nall the other dental and gingival diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese call the toothache _ya-tong_, and distinguish a great many\r\nvarieties of the malady, that is:\r\n\r\n1. _Fong-je-tong._ This kind of toothache is caused by sudden cold,\r\nand has the following characteristic symptoms: Red and swollen gums,\r\nwhich after a little time discharge purulent and fetid mucus; abundant\r\nsalivation; acute pain; swelling of the cheek. It is to be cured with\r\ndraughts, mouth washes, and various kinds of frictions.\r\n\r\nWe consider it useless to give the particulars of the various receipts,\r\nbecause Dabry hardly ever translates the names of the drugs of which\r\nthey are compounded. These formulæ are therefore incomprehensible by\r\nmost people.\r\n\r\n2. _Fong-lan-tong._ This kind of toothache is also caused by cold. The\r\npain is very great, but the gums are neither red nor swollen.\r\n\r\n3. _Ye-tong._ Is also produced by chill. The gums are red and swollen;\r\nthere is no discharge of mucus; great pain, which is aggravated by cold\r\nliquids. If the malady lasts for some time, the gums end by becoming\r\nblack, and the teeth are loosened; the pain becomes more intense in\r\nspitting. In this stage of the malady the sufferer no longer fears\r\ncold drinks, but rather desires them, to soothe the pain. The cure\r\nvaries according to whether the malady be of recent or of old date;\r\nit consists in the use of internal remedies (pills, potions), or of\r\nfrictions on the part where the pain is situated.\r\n\r\n4. _Han-tong._ This is also owing to the action of the cold. Pains in\r\nthe cheek and forehead proceeding from the teeth; no diseased condition\r\neither of the gums or of the alveoli.\r\n\r\n5. _Tou-tan-tong._ Violent cough and toothache at the same time;\r\ndifficulty in masticating.\r\n\r\n6. _Yn-hiue-tong._ The gums are pale, or violet-red, hard and lumpy,\r\nsometimes bleeding; the toothache is continuous. Among the numerous\r\nremedies recommended against this malady (mouth washes, frictions,\r\ndraughts, pills), one particularly deserves mention: it is the urine of\r\na child used as a mouth wash.\r\n\r\n7. _Tchong-che-tong._ Pain in the teeth after mastication; there is\r\nalso sometimes excoriation of the gums; flow of purulent mucus mixed\r\nwith blood; bad-smelling breath; the tooth falls; it is decayed,\r\nand one can perfectly well distinguish a small hole; the root is\r\nunsound; in extracting the tooth one sometimes brings away together\r\nwith it a little white worm, with a black spot on the head, which\r\ncan be distinguished by the aid of a magnifying glass. A remedy must\r\nimmediately be administered to destroy these worms, otherwise the\r\npatient runs the risk of having his other teeth attacked in the same\r\nmanner, and of their falling out. The remedies against this affection\r\nare most numerous, and belong for the most part to the oftentimes cited\r\ncategories. One of them presents a certain interest, its basis being\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\nIn Dabry’s book it is described in the following manner: “Arsenic (gr.\r\n1.80), _houang-tan_ (gr. 3.60); pulverize, mix with water, and with a\r\npart of the mass form a small pill, which put close to the aching tooth\r\nor into the ear, if afraid of the arsenic; then sleep. Cure certain.”\r\n\r\n8. Toothache, the effect of general weakness, following principally on\r\nabuse of coition. It is to be cured by the use of internal medicine,\r\nor by local remedies to be rubbed on the painful spot. Some of the\r\nmedicaments registered in this paragraph have reference to the special\r\ncase, in which the teeth are loosened through excess of coition.\r\nAmong others there is a prescription for a dentifrice powder for\r\nstrengthening the teeth, to be used every morning.\r\n\r\n9. Toothache following on a blow. It is to be cured by using a certain\r\ndentifrice powder, composed of six ingredients. Another medicament\r\nconsists in heating about an ounce and one-half of silver in some\r\nrecipient, and then pouring wine upon it, and rinsing the mouth with it.\r\n\r\nBesides these nine kinds of toothache, the Chinese doctors recognized\r\na peculiar morbid condition of the teeth and their surrounding parts,\r\nwhich is thus described in Dabry’s book:\r\n\r\n“It sometimes occurs, after recovery from illness, that convalescents,\r\nin order to acquire strength, drink too great a quantity of wine; and\r\nthat this after a certain time produces a beginning of inflammation of\r\nthe stomach. In such cases the teeth often fall out, the breath becomes\r\nfetid, and if the patient eats hot food, the empty alveoli as well as\r\nthe cheeks are painful.”\r\n\r\nVarious internal medicaments and dentifrice powders are prescribed for\r\ncombating this morbid condition. One of these latter includes a great\r\nnumber of ingredients in its composition; among others, the bones of\r\nmice.\r\n\r\nMention is also made of certain remedies, to which recourse may be had\r\nat times, for allaying violent dental pains, of whatsoever kind, or\r\nwhatever be the cause that occasions them.\r\n\r\nOne of these remedies is composed of different substances (among them,\r\ngarlic and saltpetre), to be pulverized and made into pills. If the\r\npain be on the left side, one introduces one of the pills into the\r\nright ear, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe formula is also given for a very complicated medicated powder,\r\nto be snuffed up in the left nostril if the person suffering from\r\ntoothache be a man; in the right if a woman.\r\n\r\nAnother powder is to be smelt with the right nostril or with the left,\r\ncorresponding to the side on which the pain is located.\r\n\r\nAbscesses and fistulæ of the gums are spoken of as follows:\r\n\r\n“It sometimes occurs that an abscess forms in some one point of the\r\ngum; this communicates great pain to the tooth near it; the abscess\r\nis white, with discharge of purulent matter.” The treatment consists\r\nin the use of different medicated powders, to be rubbed on the\r\naffected part. Two of the powders contain musk, besides several other\r\ningredients. A lotion is also prescribed.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter the following affections are described:\r\n\r\n1. _Ya-heou._ Gums are red, soft, and swollen, and a fetid and purulent\r\nmatter exudes from them; the teeth are not painful; if the gums are\r\nlanced, blood of a pale red color flows from them in abundance. This\r\nmalady is to be treated with various internal medicines and sometimes\r\nwith scarification.\r\n\r\n2. _Ja-suen._ Gums swollen; little by little they are corroded and\r\ndestroyed by ulceration, which leaves the roots of the teeth bared;\r\nthe patient has an aversion for hot food; continued pain in the teeth;\r\ndischarge of purulent and fetid mucus; by the slightest exposure to\r\ncold the pain becomes very violent. This affection is to be combated\r\nwith internal remedies and local treatment (frictions with medicated\r\npowders; application of an ointment of very complicated preparation).\r\n\r\n3. _Tchuen-ya-kan._ The gums are painful for a few days; apparition\r\nof the root of the tooth; absence of ulceration. Children of five or\r\nsix years of age are frequently exposed to this malady. The best means\r\nof cure consists in the extraction of the tooth. There are, besides,\r\nvarious internal and external remedies prescribed. One of these latter\r\ncontains verdigris and three other ingredients. Among those to be used\r\ninternally there is a decoction prepared with twelve different drugs,\r\ntwo of which are mint and rhubarb. The quantity of rhubarb is about\r\nseven and one-half grams; therefore, this prescription is certainly\r\nintended to act as a purgative.\r\n\r\n4. _Ya-ting._ The right or left gum suddenly swells; a tumor forms\r\nof about the size of a grain of sorgo; in the beginning it is red,\r\nafterward black; severe pain in the cheek and neck; itching in the\r\ncheek; the tumor afterward bursts, giving exit to blood, and becomes\r\nblack; it ought to be pricked directly (before it opens of itself)\r\nwith a silver needle; blood of a violet color will flow from it, which\r\nshould be left free course until it regains its ordinary color. The\r\nsufferer has at the same time pains in the stomach, great thirst,\r\nabdominal pains, and sometimes even delirium.\r\n\r\n5. _Ya-jong._ Gums swollen and painful, abscess, fever, swollen cheeks;\r\ngreat thirst, and vomiting of a liquid kind; dejections dry. The\r\ntreatment consists in the methodical use of certain medicines to be\r\nused internally, among which is rhubarb. If one neglects to make use of\r\nthis treatment, an ulceration sets in with discharge of a purulent and\r\nsanguine mucus; it is then necessary to rub the part with a medicinal\r\nsubstance called by the Chinese, _ping-pang-san_. Should the tooth be\r\nsomewhat loose, it ought to be extracted and the gum rubbed again with\r\nthe substance just now named.\r\n\r\n6. _Tso-ma-ya-kan._ An illness common to children after the smallpox;\r\nulceration of the gums, which turn black; fetid breath. In certain\r\ncases the gums are hard and the mucous membrane of the cheek is also\r\nattacked; all the teeth shake; there is flow of blood from the gums,\r\nupon which certain spots begin to form that are clearly distinguishable\r\nas small holes. These holes must be filled with a particular medicinal\r\nsubstance (named _lay-ma-ting-kouei-sse_), and, besides, one ought to\r\nmake use of various other internal and external remedies.\r\n\r\nThis is a very serious illness. In the case of recovery, the patient\r\nought to abstain from taking any heating aliment for one hundred days.\r\n\r\n7. _Tsee-kin-tong_ or _tsee-ly-tong_. Gums swollen; slight but\r\ncontinuous pain, aggravated by the effort of the wind; the gums become\r\nulcerated little by little, with discharge of purulent and sanguine\r\nmucus; and the root of the tooth is afterward seen to be uncovered.\r\nThis malady is to be treated by means of draughts, pills, mouth washes,\r\nand frictions of various kinds.\r\n\r\nAfter the treatise on the maladies referred to above, we find in\r\nDabry’s book a long series of “general remedies for every kind of\r\ntoothache.” There are about forty of these, and decoctions and powders\r\npredominate among them, the latter to be rubbed on the painful spot.\r\nDecoctions are the form of medicament most in use among the Chinese.\r\nIn this list of about forty anti-odontalgic remedies we find as many\r\nas eighteen decoctions, seven for internal use, and the others to\r\nbe employed as mouth washes. Some of the latter are compounded with\r\nvinegar instead of with water.\r\n\r\nFour remedies of the above list are to be made into a paste and formed\r\ninto pills, to be applied upon the aching tooth.\r\n\r\nAnother medicament is also to be formed into pills and applied inside\r\nthe ear.\r\n\r\nThe following remedy is particularly worthy of note:\r\n\r\n“One roasts a bit of garlic, crushes it between the teeth, and\r\nafterward mixes it with chopped horseradish seeds, reducing the whole\r\nto a paste with human milk; one then forms it into pills; these are to\r\nbe introduced into the nose on the side opposed to that where the pain\r\nis situated.”\r\n\r\nTwo other remedies, in powder, are to be snuffed up through the nose.\r\n\r\nA powder to prevent the progress of caries is prescribed, with which\r\nthe tooth should be rubbed every day, or it may be applied on the\r\ndecayed spot.\r\n\r\nFinally, two powders are also prescribed for whitening the teeth. One\r\nof these is compounded of seven ingredients, among which is musk; the\r\nother has only three substances in its composition: salt (gram 25),\r\nmusk (gram 1.8), _tsang-eul-tsee_ (gram 36).\r\n\r\nA therapeutic method much in vogue among the Chinese is acupuncture,\r\nwhich is used in the treatment of the greatest variety of affections,\r\nincluding those of the dental system. The doctors of the Celestial\r\nEmpire have the greatest faith in this operation, which they hold\r\ncapable of removing obstacles to the free circulation of humors and\r\nvital spirits, thus reëstablishing that equilibrium of the organic\r\nforces which constitutes health, and the absence of which causes\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese doctors prefer to use gold or silver needles for\r\npuncturing; but they also frequently use needles of the best steel.\r\nThese instruments vary very much in length, in thickness, and in form,\r\nand there are not less than nine distinct kinds of puncturing needles.\r\n\r\nEvery doctor who intends dedicating himself to the practice of this\r\noperation has to begin by the most accurate study of the elective\r\npoints for puncturing according to the various affections; he should\r\nalso know to what depth precisely to drive the needles in each case,\r\nin order to reach the site of the morbific principle and procure\r\nconvenient exit for it; he ought to know equally well how long to\r\nleave the needle in the affected part, so as to obtain the best\r\npossible therapeutic results in each case.\r\n\r\nThe points of election for carrying out puncturing in various maladies\r\nare spread over the whole superficies of the body, and amount in\r\nnumber to 388. Each of these is known by a special name. Each site of\r\nelection stands in determinate relations, as to distance, to the known\r\nanatomical points, and may, therefore, be easily and precisely found\r\nby appropriate measurement. The unity of length for these measurements\r\nis called _tsun_, and is divided into ten _fen_; its value varies,\r\nhowever, according to whether the said measurements be taken on the\r\nhead, the trunk, or the extremities. For the head, the length of the\r\n_tsun_ is calculated as equal to the distance existing between the\r\ninner and the outer angle of the eye; for the trunk, it is equivalent\r\nto the eighth part of the horizontal line between the two breast\r\nnipples; and for the extremities, it is equal to the length of the\r\nsecond phalanx of the middle finger, measured with the joints bent.\r\n\r\nThere are twenty-six points of election upon which to carry out\r\npuncturing used as a remedy against toothache. There are also six other\r\npoints of election for pains in the gums.\r\n\r\nOne would naturally be disposed to believe that these points of\r\nelection would be situated in proximity to the teeth. Instead, many\r\nof them are situated in distant parts of the body—for example, in the\r\nelbow, in the hands, the feet, the vertebral region, the coccyx, and\r\nso on. However, about half of them are to be found in the labial,\r\nmaxillary, and periauricular regions.\r\n\r\nThe puncturing of every point of election is almost always indicated\r\nfor the cure of not only one but several, and, indeed, very often\r\nmany, maladies; for example, the puncture carried out on the point of\r\nelection, _kin-tche_, situated at the outer extremity of the bend of\r\nthe elbow, may be utilized in more than twenty-five morbid conditions;\r\namong which are pains in the arm, paralysis of the arm, edema of the\r\nwhole body, excessive perspiring, vomiting, hematemesis, toothache,\r\nboils, gastralgia, hemiplegia, and even cholera!\r\n\r\nThis mode of cure depends on the special relation of each point of\r\nelection to the so-called canals of transmission and communication\r\n(named in Chinese _king_) through which the blood and the vital spirits\r\ncirculate, and which serve at the same time to transmit the “innate\r\nheat” and “the radical moisture” to all parts of the body.\r\n\r\nAnd here we must be allowed a brief digression in explanation of what\r\nwe have just said.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical notions of the Chinese are very erroneous;[27] their\r\nideas on the functions of the human body and of human life in general,\r\ndiffer considerably from ours. They recognize two natural principles of\r\nvitality, one they call _yang_ (vital, primordial, or “innate heat”),\r\nthe other _yn_ (radical moisture). The spirits (that is the air) and\r\nthe blood serve as vehicles to these two essential principles of life;\r\nthat is, vital heat and radical moisture. The constant equilibrium, the\r\naccord, the perfect union of these two essential principles of life\r\nconstitute a state of health. From their alteration, corruption, or\r\ndisunion originate all diseases.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve principal sources of vitality in the human organism;\r\nthat is, twelve organs from which the two aforesaid vital principles\r\nare distributed throughout the body: The heart, the liver, the two\r\nkidneys, the lungs, and the spleen are the seat and origin of radical\r\nmoisture; the large and the small intestine, the two ureters, the\r\ngall-bladder, and the stomach are the seat and origin of vital heat.\r\nThese twelve sources of life are in intimate relation with one another\r\nby means of the canals of communication, through which the blood and\r\nthe vital spirits (air) circulate, carrying with them into every part\r\nof the body vital heat and radical moisture.[28]\r\n\r\nThe points of election upon which to carry out puncturing are situated\r\nalong the course of the large lines of communication and transmission;\r\nand that explains, according to the Chinese medical theories, why a\r\npuncture carried out on a given point of the body can prove useful in\r\nrelieving a variety of maladies even in distant parts of the organism.\r\n\r\nPuncturing is almost always associated with cauterization, for after\r\nhaving drawn out the needle, it is usual to cauterize the site of the\r\npuncture with the so-called “_moxa_,” that is, with a kind of vegetable\r\nwool obtained from the leaves and dried tips of the artemisia. One\r\ncompresses this substance very tightly between the fingers into the\r\nshape of a small cone. One next applies a small coin with a hole in the\r\ncentre upon the site of election; the cone of moxa is placed on the\r\nhole in the coin and lighted at its top. As the cone is very compact,\r\nit burns slowly enough, without developing excessive heat, so that,\r\naccording to Ten Rhyne,[29] who was an enthusiast for this mode of\r\ncure, “the epidermis is drawn without violence and rises gently into a\r\nsmall blister. The moxa, whilst burning, draws out the _peccant humors_\r\nvisibly, absorbing them in such a manner that they are totally consumed\r\nwithout destroying the skin itself.”\r\n\r\nThe application of the moxa is not as painful as might be thought,\r\nand even children support it without much crying. The number of times\r\nfor repeating the operation varies according to the malady and the\r\nsite of application, etc. Thus, in the point _kin-tche_, which we have\r\nmentioned once before, the cauterization is generally repeated seven\r\ntimes, but in certain cases the number may be brought up to 200.\r\n\r\nThere are certain points of election for which puncturing alone is\r\nprescribed without subsequent cauterization; in other instances, the\r\npuncturing is held to be unnecessary or even dangerous; one, therefore,\r\nonly applies the moxa in these cases.[30]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the moxa was still more in use than in China. According\r\nto Ten Rhyne, from the remotest times the moxa has been the best\r\nand almost the sole mode of treatment for illness in Japan, and was\r\nregarded not only as an excellent remedy, but also as an excellent\r\npreservative; so much so that even convicts condemned to perpetual\r\nimprisonment had permission to go out every six months to undergo this\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nDental affections also were especially treated with the moxa, and,\r\njudging by what Ten Rhyne says on the subject, it would seem that this\r\ncaustic, when used against toothache, was usually applied in the region\r\nof the mental foramen.[31]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCUSTOMS RELATING TO THE TEETH AMONG DIFFERENT PRIMITIVE PEOPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph Murphy, in his book, _A Natural History of the Human Teeth_,[32]\r\nsays that the natives of Hindostan, especially the Brahmins or priests\r\nof Brahma, take extreme care of their teeth. Every morning they rub\r\nthem for about an hour with a small twig of the fig tree, at the same\r\ntime that, turned toward the rising sun, they recite their prayers\r\nand invoke Heaven’s blessing on themselves and their families. As\r\nthis custom is prescribed in the most ancient codes and religious\r\nwritings of India, it reverts, without doubt, to the remotest ages,\r\nand, therefore, demonstrates the great importance that this people,\r\nand particularly the Brahmin caste, has ever attributed to beauty and\r\ncleanliness of the teeth. Murphy affirms that the Brahmins, in general,\r\nhave magnificent teeth; and that this depends, certainly in great part,\r\non the assiduous and scrupulous care that they take of them.\r\n\r\nFrom the writings of their ancient poets one also deduces in what high\r\nesteem the people of India held beautiful teeth, considering them one\r\nof the principal ornaments of the face. The lover, says Murphy, never\r\nneglected, in enumerating the beauties of his lady-love, to praise the\r\nwhiteness and regularity of her teeth.\r\n\r\nAmong some of the people of India, when the second dentition is\r\ncompleted, it is customary to separate the teeth one from the other\r\nwith a file; we do not know, however, whether this is done as an\r\nembellishment or with some other object—perhaps, as suggested by Joseph\r\nLinderer,[33] to prevent caries.\r\n\r\nAnyhow, this and other customs in vogue in various parts of India and\r\nin many islands of Oceanica demonstrate that these peoples attribute\r\ngreat importance to the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe substituting of gold teeth for those missing has been in use in\r\nJava from exceedingly remote times.[34]\r\n\r\nDyeing the teeth black is considered a great embellishment among many\r\nraces of Asia and Oceanica; this operation is sometimes preceded by\r\nanother, viz., the filling up of the interdental spaces very cleverly\r\nwith gold leaf.[35]\r\n\r\nIn Sumatra and the neighboring islands many women file their teeth down\r\nto the gums; others file them into points; or partially remove the\r\nenamel so as to render it easier to apply the black dye; this being\r\nheld to be the height of elegance. Men of high rank and condition dye\r\ntheir upper teeth black and cover the lower ones with fine gold plates,\r\nwhich in a full light produces what they consider a fine contrast. The\r\nnatives of other islands gild the upper central incisors and dye the\r\nothers black.[36]\r\n\r\nIn Japan, the married women may easily be distinguished from the others\r\nby their black and shining teeth. The coloring preparation they use\r\nto blacken the teeth is composed of urine, raspings of iron, and a\r\nsubstance called _saki_. This mixture has a most unpleasant odor, and\r\nif applied on the skin acts as a caustic. Its action on the teeth is\r\nso powerful that they do not regain their whiteness even after a lapse\r\nof years. In applying this substance, and also for some time after,\r\nthe women take care to preserve their gums and lips from its effects,\r\nas it would otherwise cause them to assume a dark blue tint.[37] The\r\ninhabitants of the Pelew Islands make use of the wild thistle and\r\nshell chalk to blacken the teeth. It is also the custom to blacken the\r\nteeth among the inhabitants of Tonkin and Siam, the women of the Maria\r\nIslands, and the single ladies of Java.\r\n\r\nSome of the peoples of Eastern India plane their teeth down to an even\r\nlevel; and from the habit of masticating areca nuts mixed with chalk\r\nand other substances, their lips and teeth are dyed red. At Macassar\r\nthe natives have their teeth dyed red; they also substitute missing\r\nteeth by artificial ones made of gold, silver, or tombac.[38]\r\n\r\nNegroes, especially those of Abyssinia, very often file their incisors\r\ninto points to resemble the form of the canines; this is in order to\r\ngive themselves an air of greater ferocity.\r\n\r\nMurphy relates that the inhabitants of one of the islands of the\r\nSound make an incision in the upper lip in a parallel line with the\r\nmouth, and large enough to allow the tongue to pass. After the margins\r\nhave healed they have a great resemblance to the lips. This kind of\r\nartificial mouth is made to support a shell, carved in such a manner as\r\nto produce the effect of a row of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe natives of the Sandwich Islands sacrifice their front teeth to\r\nconciliate the favor of their god Eatoa.[39]\r\n\r\nAmong the natives of New South Wales, it is the custom when a youth\r\nreaches virility to knock out his front teeth with a stone; this\r\noperation being carried out by the _kuradshis_ or wizards.\r\n\r\nThe savages of Peru are also in the habit of making the front teeth\r\nfall out; the reason of the custom is that the space thus made is\r\nregarded by them as an embellishment.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE GREEKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ancient Greek physician—Asklepios, afterward called\r\nÆsculapius[41]—by the ability he displayed in the art of healing, so\r\nimpressed the minds of the simple and uncultured at that primitive\r\nepoch as to be held in repute rather as a god than as a man. Not only\r\nwas he held to be the author of wonderful cures, but it was also\r\naffirmed that he had resuscitated the dead; no doubt from his having\r\nin some case or other of apparent death restored the individual to\r\nconsciousness by the assistance he rendered him. Exaggeration, so\r\nnatural to ignorant minds, afterward did the rest, and magnified the\r\nhealing and restoring powers of Æsculapius to such an extent that it is\r\nnot to be wondered at that he should have been looked upon as a divine\r\nbeing. With the lapse of time, various traditions formed around his\r\nname, among which there was, however, finally such discrepancy that\r\nthe popular voice spoke no more of one, but of many Æsculapii,[42] and\r\nto one of these was attributed, among other merits, that of having\r\ninvented the probe and the art of bandaging wounds, while another was\r\nheld to be the inventor of purgatives and of the extraction of teeth.\r\n\r\nAccording, therefore, to these traditions, dental surgery had its\r\norigin with Æsculapius, the god of Medicine. But what was the precise\r\nepoch in which this benefactor of humanity lived?\r\n\r\nWe learn from Homer that two sons of Æsculapius, Machaon and\r\nPodalirius,[43] took special part, as doctors, in the siege of Troy.\r\nThis celebrated siege, which lasted ten years, took place in the\r\ntwelfth century before the Christian era (that is, 1193 to 1184 B.C.);\r\nadmitting, therefore, the account of the parentage to be authentic, one\r\nmay argue therefrom that Æsculapius must have lived between the twelfth\r\nand thirteenth centuries B.C. Many temples were built and dedicated to\r\nÆsculapius; these were called _asklepeia_, after the Greek form of his\r\nname. The priests were called _Asklepiadi_, and alleged their direct\r\ndescent from Æsculapius himself.\r\n\r\nThe temples of Æsculapius became so numerous in time that they were\r\nto be found in almost every Greek city. The most celebrated were those\r\nof Epidaurus, Cos, Cnydus, and Rhodes, as well as that of the great\r\ncity of Agrigentum, in Sicily. The Asklepiadi not only performed the\r\ntemple rites, but were doctors at the same time, for as interpreters\r\nof the wisdom of the god, they also occupied themselves in curing the\r\nsick. From this it resulted that these temples became in time, through\r\nobservation and experience, schools of medical science.\r\n\r\nBut besides this sacerdotal medicine, there was also a lay medicine\r\nin Greece. Many great philosophers, especially Pythagoras, Alcmeon\r\nof Croton, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and Democritus, occupied\r\nthemselves with physiology, with hygiene, and with medicine; also the\r\ngymnasiarchs, or directors of gymnasiums, or schools of gymnastics,\r\nan art having for its end to increase physical strength and maintain\r\nhealth, cultivated medicine, particularly that part of it which\r\nconcerns hygiene, dietetics, and surgery as applied to the treatment of\r\nviolent lesions, such as fractures, luxations, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Asklepiadi often themselves imparted the principles of medicine\r\nto students outside their caste. Lay medicine thus gradually came to\r\nsupplant sacerdotal medicine, especially after Hippocrates, who through\r\nhis works, exercised a preponderant influence in the secularization\r\nof the science. However, the Asklepiadi, on their side, continued to\r\npractise medicine up to the time when the pagan temples fell into\r\ncomplete ruin, through the advance of Christianity.\r\n\r\nOn the columns of the asklepeia and on the votive tables were written\r\nthe names of those cured by the god, together with indications\r\nregarding their various maladies and the treatment by virtue of which\r\nthe sick had been restored to health.\r\n\r\nSurgical instruments of proved utility were deposited in the temples.\r\nCelius Aurelianus makes mention of a leaden instrument used for the\r\nextraction of teeth (_plumbeum odontagogon_), which was exhibited in\r\nthe temple of Apollo, at Delphi.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, it would seem more natural that this instrument\r\nshould have been shown in the temple of Æsculapius, he being the\r\ngod of Medicine, and believed, besides, to be the inventor of\r\ndental extraction. One is rather inclined by this to think that the\r\n_odontagogon_ may have been deposited in the temple of Apollo before\r\nthe building of Æsculapian temples. Indeed, who can tell if Æsculapius\r\nhimself, not yet deified, may not have deposited there a model of the\r\ninstrument he had invented!\r\n\r\nFrom the fact of the _odontagogon_ in the temple of Apollo being made\r\nof lead, Erasistratus, Celius Aurelianus, and other ancient writers\r\nhave drawn the deduction that it was only permissible to extract teeth\r\nwhen they were loose enough to be taken out with a leaden instrument.\r\nBut Serre[44] observes, not without reason, that if a tooth be so\r\nunsteady as to be able to be extracted with leaden pincers, this may\r\njust as well be done, and perhaps even better, by pinching the tooth\r\nbetween the fingers, no other aid being required than a handkerchief\r\nto prevent them from slipping. Avulsive pincers of lead would be,\r\ntherefore, a nearly useless invention; so it is much more probable,\r\nas Serre remarks, that the original pincers were of iron, and that\r\nthe inventor, reserving these for his own use, made a simple model of\r\nthe same in lead (this being easier to do) and deposited it in the\r\ntemple of Apollo, in order to make known the form of the instrument\r\nto contemporaries and to posterity, naturally supposing that whoever\r\nwished to copy it would understand of himself, or learn from the\r\npriests, that it was to be made of iron and not of lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7\r\n\r\nPortrayal of a dental operation on a vase of Phœnician origin, found in\r\nCrimea (see Cigrand, Rise, Fall, and Revival of Dental Prosthesis, pp.\r\n60-63 and 287).]\r\n\r\nHIPPOCRATES. The sacerdotal and philosophical schools of medicine, as\r\nwell as the gymnasiums, were the three great sources whence Hippocrates\r\nderived his first knowledge of medicine.\r\n\r\nHippocrates was born in the island of Cos, toward the year 460 B.C. He\r\nbelonged to the sacerdotal caste of the Asklepiadi, and was, according\r\nto some of his earliest biographers, the nineteenth descendant of\r\nÆsculapius on his father’s side, and the twentieth descendant of\r\nHercules on his mother’s side. The time of his death is even still more\r\nuncertain than that of his birth, for, according to some, he died at\r\neighty-three, according to others, at eighty-five, at ninety, at one\r\nhundred and four, and even at one hundred and nine years of age.\r\n\r\nHippocrates was initiated in the study of medicine by his own father,\r\nHeraclides; but in the medical art he also had as a teacher the\r\ngymnasiarch Herodicus of Selymbria; besides, he studied eloquence under\r\nthe sophist Gorgia and philosophy under the celebrated Democritus. He\r\ntreasured up all the records of medical practice that were preserved\r\nin the temple of Cos; but according to some ancient authors he is said\r\nto have set fire afterward to this temple, and to have left his native\r\ncountry in order to flee from the resentment he had aroused. Probably\r\nit was the priests themselves who attributed the burning of the temple\r\n(which certainly took place at that time) to Hippocrates, out of\r\njealousy for his growing fame; though it may also be possible that this\r\ngreat man, having first collected together all that was useful among\r\nthe medical records that were to be found there, afterward courageously\r\ndestroyed this centre of superstition, so that medicine, ceasing to\r\nbe confused with imposture and being despoiled of the supernatural\r\ncharacter attributed to it, which paralyzed its progress, should become\r\na liberal and human art, based purely on the observation of clinical\r\nfacts and the study of natural laws.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, Hippocrates travelled in various parts of Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa, everywhere making valuable observations. He finally\r\nreturned to his native country, where through the practice of medicine\r\nand by his immortal writings he acquired such esteem and veneration\r\nthat his compatriots almost tributed him with divine honors after death.\r\n\r\nNot all, however, of the works that make up the so-called collection of\r\nHippocrates were really written by the father of medicine. Two of his\r\nsons—Thessalus and Draco—and his son-in-law Polybius also distinguished\r\nthemselves by the practice of medicine and by their admirable writings,\r\nwhich together with those of other doctors of that period were\r\nerroneously included in the collection of Hippocrates’ works. At any\r\nrate, the collection of Hippocrates faithfully represents the state\r\nof medicine and surgery at the epoch in which he and his disciples\r\nflourished, that is, toward the end of the fifth and during the fourth\r\ncentury before the Christian era.[45]\r\n\r\nNeither Hippocrates nor others before him had ever dissected corpses;\r\nit is, therefore, not to be wondered at that the anatomical notions\r\ncontained in the Hippocratic works should be scarce and very often\r\ninexact. The physiological notions also are highly deficient and\r\nimperfect, which is, indeed, very natural, for an exact knowledge of\r\nthe functions of the human body presupposes an exact knowledge of the\r\nrelative organs.\r\n\r\nThe philosophical ideas of the time had considerable influence on the\r\nmedical theories of Hippocrates and his successors. The universe was\r\nconsidered as constituted by four elements: earth, air, fire, water. To\r\neach of these elements a special quality was attributed, and, thus, one\r\nrecognized four fundamental qualities, viz., cold, dryness, heat, and\r\nmoisture. Man—the most perfect being—was regarded as a “microcosmos,”\r\nor small world in himself, that is, a sort of compendium of the whole\r\nuniverse, and his organism, in correlation to the four primordial\r\nelements of the universe, was believed to be constituted of four\r\nfundamental humors—the blood, the pituita or mucus, the yellow bile,\r\nand the black bile or atrabile.\r\n\r\nHealth, says Hippocrates,[46] depends on the just relation one to\r\nanother of these principles, as to composition, force, and quantity,\r\nand on their perfect mixture; instead, when one of the four principles\r\nis wanting or in excess, or separates itself from the other components\r\nof the organism, one has a diseased condition. In fact, he adds,\r\nif some one humor flow from the body in a measure superior to its\r\nsuperabundance, such a loss will occasion illness. If, then, the humor\r\nseparated from the others collect in the interior of the body, not\r\nonly the part that remains deprived of its presence will suffer, but\r\nalso that into which the flow takes place and where the engorgement is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nWe have here briefly stated these generalities in order to make\r\nourselves clearly understood in speaking hereafter on different\r\nsubjects, whether with regard to Hippocrates or to other authors of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn the works of Hippocrates there is not one chapter that treats\r\nseparately of the affections of the teeth, just as there is no book\r\nin which he speaks separately of diseases of the vascular or nervous\r\nsystems, and so on. There are, nevertheless, a great number of passages\r\nscattered throughout the Hippocratic collection from which we can\r\ndeduce very clearly the great importance that the Father of Medicine\r\nascribed to the teeth and to their maladies.\r\n\r\nIn the book _De carnibus_, the formation of the teeth is spoken of\r\namong other things. It might have been supposed that Hippocrates\r\nwould have been ignorant of the fact that the formation of the teeth\r\ncommences in the intra-uterine life. This, however, is not the case;\r\nin fact, he says: “The first teeth are formed by the nourishment of\r\nthe fetus in the womb, and after birth by the mother’s milk. Those\r\nthat come forth after these are shed are formed by food and drink. The\r\nshedding of the first teeth generally takes place at about seven years\r\nof age, those that come forth after this grow old with the man, unless\r\nsome illness destroys them.”[47] And a little farther on one reads:\r\n“From seven to fourteen the larger teeth come forth and all the others\r\nthat substitute those derived from the nourishment of the fetus in the\r\nwomb. In the fourth septennial period of life there appear in most\r\npeople two teeth that are called wisdom teeth.”[48]\r\n\r\nThere is a passage in this same book _De carnibus_, in which the great\r\nimportance of the teeth for clear pronunciation of words is alluded\r\nto: “The body,” says Hippocrates,[49] “attracts the air into itself;\r\nthe air expelled through the void produces a sound, because the head\r\nresounds. The tongue articulates, and by its movements, coming into\r\ncontact with the palate and the teeth, renders the sounds distinct.”\r\n\r\nThe book _De dentitione_ is written in the form of brief sentences\r\nor aphorisms, and speaks of the accidents that often accompany the\r\neruption of the deciduous teeth. The most important passages in this\r\nshort treatise are the following:\r\n\r\n“Children who during dentition have their bowels frequently moved are\r\nless subject to convulsions than those who are constipated.”\r\n\r\n“Those who during dentition have a severe attack of fever rarely have\r\nconvulsions.”\r\n\r\n“Those who during dentition do not get thinner and who are very drowsy\r\nrun the risk of becoming subject to convulsions.”\r\n\r\n“On conditions of equality, those children who cut their teeth in the\r\nwinter get over the teething period the best.”\r\n\r\n“Not all the children seized with convulsions during dentition succumb\r\nto these; many are saved.”\r\n\r\n“In the case of children who suffer with cough the period of dentition\r\nis prolonged, and they get thinner than the others when the teeth come\r\nforth.”\r\n\r\nIn the third book of Aphorisms, where Hippocrates speaks of the\r\nillnesses that prevail in the various seasons of the year and in\r\nthe various ages of life, mention is also made of the accidents of\r\ndentition. The twenty-fifth aphorism says: “At the time of dentition,\r\nchildren are subject to irritation of the gums, fevers, convulsions,\r\ndiarrhea; this occurs principally at the time when the canines begin to\r\ncome forth, and in children who are very fat or constipated.”\r\n\r\nThe works of Hippocrates are nearly silent on the hygiene of the\r\nteeth; but in the second book, on the diseases of women,[50] some\r\nprescriptions are to be found against bad-smelling breath. We translate\r\nthe passage integrally:\r\n\r\n“When a woman’s mouth smells and her gums are black and unhealthy, one\r\nburns, separately, the head of a hare, and three mice, after having\r\ntaken out the intestines of two of them (not, however, the liver or the\r\nkidneys); one pounds in a stone mortar some marble or whitestone,[51]\r\nand passes it through a sieve; one then mixes equal parts of these\r\ningredients and with this mixture one rubs the teeth and the interior\r\nof the mouth; afterward one rubs them again with greasy wool[52] and\r\none washes the mouth with water. One soaks the dirty wool in honey and\r\nwith it one rubs the teeth and the gums, inside and outside. One pounds\r\ndill and anise-seeds, two oboles of myrrh;[53] one immerses these\r\nsubstances in half a cotyle[54] of pure white wine; one then rinses the\r\nmouth with it, holding it in the mouth for some time; this is to be\r\ndone frequently, and the mouth to be rinsed with the said preparation\r\nfasting and after each meal. It is an excellent thing to take small\r\nquantities of food of a very sustaining nature. The medicament\r\ndescribed above cleans the teeth and gives them a sweet smell. It is\r\nknown under the name of Indian medicament.”\r\n\r\nIn the book _De affectionibus_ there is a passage where it is said that\r\ninflammation of the gums is produced by accumulations of pituita, and\r\nthat, in like cases, masticatories are of use, as these remedies favor\r\nthe secretion of saliva, and thus tend to dissipate the engorgement\r\ncaused by pituita.\r\n\r\nStill more important, however, is the following passage of the same\r\nbook:[55]\r\n\r\n“In cases of toothache, if the tooth is decayed and loose it must be\r\nextracted. If it is neither decayed nor loose, but still painful, it is\r\nnecessary to desiccate it by cauterizing. Masticatories also do good,\r\nas the pain derives from pituita insinuating itself under the roots of\r\nthe teeth. Teeth are eroded and become decayed partly by pituita, and\r\npartly by food, when they are by nature weak and badly fixed in the\r\ngums.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates, therefore, considers affections of the teeth to depend in\r\npart on natural dispositions, that is, on congenital weakness of the\r\ndental system, in part on accumulations of pituita, and the corroding\r\naction of the same. If a painful tooth were not loose, it was not\r\nto be extracted; but one was to have recourse to cauterization and\r\nto masticatories, intended the one and the other to dissipate the\r\naccumulation of pituita, believed by him to be the cause of toothache.\r\n\r\nIt is easily to be understood that as only loose teeth were to be\r\nextracted, Hippocrates considered the extraction of teeth a very easy\r\noperation, notwithstanding that the instruments then in use cannot\r\nhave been other than very imperfect; and this is clearly to be seen\r\nfrom a passage in the book entitled _De medico_, where, after having\r\nspoken of the articles and instruments that ought to be kept in a\r\ndoctor’s office (_officina medici_), he adds:\r\n\r\n“These are the instruments necessary to the doctor’s operating room\r\nand in the handling of which the disciple should be exercised; as to\r\nthe pincers for pulling out teeth, anyone can handle them, because\r\nevidently the manner in which they are to be used is simple.”[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8\r\n\r\nVery ancient dental forceps and two other dental (?) instruments\r\nexisting in the Archæological Museum of Athens.]\r\n\r\nHaving made mention of the _officina medici_, we think it opportune\r\nto explain here with some precision what is to be understood by this\r\nterm.[57] Medicine and surgery were practised in ancient times in open\r\nshops; this was so in Greece, and later also in Rome. When the practice\r\nof medicine became secularized through its abandoning the Æsculapian\r\ntemples, doctors’ shops began to arise in the most important centres\r\nof population, to which those in need of assistance resorted or were\r\ncarried. In time these stations for the practice of medicine, and\r\nparticularly of surgery, became more and more numerous.\r\n\r\nThe Hippocratic collection contains a special treatise (_De officina\r\nmedici_), which speaks of the conditions these places were expected\r\nto fulfil, the articles therein to be contained, the instruments, the\r\ngeneral rules relative to operations, the bandages, etc.\r\n\r\nAbout six hundred years later, Galen wrote three books of commentaries\r\non this treatise of Hippocrates. He says, among other things, that the\r\ndoctor’s shop ought to be spacious and furnished with wide openings, to\r\nlet in abundance of light. These medical stations to which the sick and\r\ninfirm repaired in great numbers to ask advice, to undergo operations,\r\nor receive medical dressings, must have been of great importance, as is\r\nto be presumed from the cited books of Hippocrates and Galen.\r\n\r\nThe greatest doctors of antiquity practised the medical art in these\r\nplaces. It is also said that the great philosopher and naturalist,\r\nAristotle, who came of a race of doctors, had inherited a doctor’s shop\r\nof great value, but that notwithstanding this he refused to dedicate\r\nhimself to the medical profession.\r\n\r\nThe doctors’ shops were at the same time real pharmacies, where doctors\r\nprepared medicines, and where all the remedies then in use, either\r\nsimple or compounded, were kept and sold to the public. Besides, there\r\nwere to be found instruments of every kind and articles for medicating;\r\nand, therefore, bandages, compresses, lint, sponges, cupping glasses,\r\ncauteries, knives, bistouries, lancets, sounds, needles, hooks,\r\npincers, files, saws, scrapers, splints, appliances for replacement of\r\nluxated bones, speculums, trepans, apparatus for fumigation, trusses,\r\nand a thousand things besides.\r\n\r\nNaturally, dentistry was also practised in these shops, either by\r\ndoctors who occupied themselves with dental maladies as with those of\r\nany other part of the body, or, later on, by individuals who dedicated\r\nthemselves exclusively to this specialty.\r\n\r\nMedicine and surgery were exercised, however, not only in doctors’\r\nshops, but also at the patients’ houses, and it was Hippocrates who\r\nespecially inaugurated clinical medicine—that is, the practice of\r\nvisiting patients in their beds.\r\n\r\nBut we must not digress from our argument.\r\n\r\nMany observations relative to the teeth are to be found in the seven\r\nbooks of Hippocrates on _Epidemics_. Unfortunately, the observations\r\nare not always given in clear and precise terms, which principally\r\ndepends on the fact that these books consist for the most part of\r\nsimple and most concise notes, written by Hippocrates on cases observed\r\nby him, and not intended for publication under such form, but rather\r\nconstituting the material for further work.\r\n\r\nHere is a passage from the fourth book on _Epidemics_, which reveals\r\nHippocrates’ extraordinary power of observation, for even teeth that\r\nhad fallen out were minutely examined by him, to the end of acquiring\r\nprecise ideas on the anatomical conformation of these organs, held by\r\nhim to be of the highest importance.\r\n\r\n“In the youth suffering from a phagedenic affection in the mouth, the\r\nlower teeth fell out, as well as the front upper ones, which left a\r\ncavity in the bone. The loss of a bone in the roof of the mouth causes\r\ndepression in the middle of the nose; the falling out of the upper\r\nfront teeth sometimes causes a flattening of the point of the nose. The\r\nfifth teeth counting from the front ones had four roots (two of which\r\nwere almost united to the two contiguous teeth), the points of which\r\nwere all turned inward. Suppurations arising from the third tooth are\r\nmore frequent than from any of the others; and the dense discharge from\r\nthe nose and pains in the temples are specially owing to it. This tooth\r\nis more apt to decay than the others; but the fifth does so, as well.\r\nThis tooth had a tubercle in the middle and two in the front; a small\r\ntubercle in the internal part, on the side of the other two, had first\r\nbegun to decay.[58] The seventh tooth had only one large, sharp-pointed\r\nroot. In the Athenian boy, there was pain in a lower tooth on the left,\r\nand in an upper one on the right. When the pain ceased, there was\r\nsuppuration of the right ear.”\r\n\r\nThis last fact—of the suppuration of the ear—is mentioned by\r\nHippocrates not as a simple coincidence, but as a fact intimately\r\nconnected with the cessation of the toothache. This may be argued\r\nfrom the general ideas of Hippocrates in regard to the beginning and\r\nthe resolution of diseases. He considers a malady to be produced by\r\na humor, which becomes localized in a given point of the body. The\r\n_crisis_ gives exit to the peccant humor,[59] and the mode in which\r\nthis is evacuated constitutes the _critical phenomenon_; the same may\r\nbe represented either by a profuse perspiration, by abundant urine, by\r\ndiarrhea, by vomiting, by expectoration, by bleeding or discharge of\r\nother humors from the nose, by the issuing of pus from the ear, and\r\neven by deposits on the teeth.[60] If by effect of _organic sympathies_\r\nthe morbid humor, instead of being thrown outward, be transported into\r\nanother region of the body, this constitutes the so-called _metastasis_.\r\n\r\nThe hints just given will serve to render some of the passages which we\r\nquote from the works of Hippocrates more intelligible.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth book on _Epidemics_ we find among other clinical cases\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n“Egesistratus had a suppuration near the eye. An abscess manifested\r\nitself near the last tooth; the eye directly got quite well; there was\r\na dense discharge of pus from the nostrils; and small, rounded pieces\r\nof flesh were detached from the gums. It seemed as though a suppuration\r\nat the third tooth were going to take place, but it went back; and\r\nsuddenly the jaw and the eye swelled up.”[61]\r\n\r\nAnd farther on one reads:\r\n\r\n“In Egesistratus the two last teeth were decayed in the parts where\r\nthey touched one another. The last had two tuberosities above the gum,\r\none on the decayed side, the other on the opposite side. In the part\r\nin which the two teeth were in contact with one another there were two\r\nroots in each, large and similar, and corresponding to those of the\r\ncontiguous tooth; on the other side there was only a half root[62] and\r\nrounded.”\r\n\r\nToward the end of the fourth book on _Epidemics_, we find repeated an\r\nobservation which we have already noted:\r\n\r\n“The third upper tooth is found to be decayed more frequently than all\r\nthe others. Sometimes a suppuration is produced all around it.”[63]\r\n\r\nIn the following passage mention is made of a mouth wash against\r\ntoothache, the basis of which is castoreum and pepper:\r\n\r\n“In consequence of a violent toothache the wife of Aspasius had her\r\ncheeks swollen up; but on making use of a mouth wash of castoreum and\r\npepper she found great relief.”[64]\r\n\r\nA little after we find the practice of bleeding mentioned; and\r\ncontemporarily an allusion to the use of alum—with regard to a painful\r\nswelling of the gums, that is to say, a gingivitis:\r\n\r\n“Melisandrus suffered severe pain and swelling of the gums; he was\r\nbled in the arm. Egyptian alum, if used in this malady, arrests its\r\ndevelopment.”[65]\r\n\r\nToward the commencement of the sixth book the following observation is\r\nregistered:\r\n\r\n“Among those individuals whose heads are long-shaped, some have thick\r\nnecks, strong members and bones; others have strongly arched palates,\r\ntheir teeth are disposed irregularly, crowding one on the other, and\r\nthey are molested by headache and otorrhea.”[66]\r\n\r\nWhile we should be tempted to attribute the knowledge of the relations\r\nbetween malformation of the skull, ogival palate, and bad arrangement\r\nof the teeth to quite modern studies, we are obliged to admit, and\r\nto our great surprise, that these relations were already noted,\r\ntwenty-four centuries back, by the great physician of Cos.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh book on _Epidemics_, a case of scorbutus is described,\r\nwhere incense and a decoction of lentils proved useful against the\r\nlesions of the buccal cavity:\r\n\r\n“... Large tubercles, of the size of grapes, had formed on the gums\r\nclose to the teeth, black and livid, but not painful, except when the\r\npatient took food. For the mouth, incense powder mixed with some other\r\ningredients proved useful. The internal use of the decoction of lentils\r\nalso did good to the ulcers of the mouth.”[67]\r\n\r\nIn the same book there is a passage in which Hippocrates warns against\r\nthe use of origanum, as harmful to the teeth and eyes:\r\n\r\n“Origanum in drinks is harmful to affections of the eyes, and also to\r\nthe teeth.”[68]\r\n\r\nFarther on a case of necrosis of the jaw is mentioned:\r\n\r\n“Cardias, the son of Metrodorus, by reason of pains in the teeth\r\nwas subject to mortification of the jaw. Excrescences of a fleshy\r\nkind formed on the gums, that grew most rapidly; the suppuration was\r\nmoderate; the molars fell out and afterward the jaw itself.”[69]\r\n\r\nSome passages in the _Epidemics_,[70] and in other books of\r\nHippocrates, even when not referring directly to pathological\r\nconditions of the teeth, are of value as demonstrating what importance\r\nthe author attaches to the dental organs, and to the phenomena of which\r\nthey may possibly become the site.\r\n\r\nIn establishing the diagnosis of a malady, he recommends searching for\r\nits point of departure; for example, if it has begun with a headache,\r\nan earache, a pain in the side, and adds, that in some cases the nature\r\nof the malady is revealed by the teeth, in some others by swelling of\r\nthe glands.[71] The truth and importance of this observation are not to\r\nbe doubted.\r\n\r\nIn fevers, Hippocrates considers it an unfavorable sign if there\r\nbe a deposit of viscous matter on the teeth, especially when the\r\npatient keeps his mouth half open, that is, when he lies in a state of\r\nstupor.[72]\r\n\r\nOther prognostics drawn from the teeth or the gums are the following:\r\n\r\n“Grinding of the teeth in those who have not this habit when in full\r\nhealth, gives reason to fear a furious delirium and death; but if the\r\npatient, already delirious, presents this sign, it is an absolutely\r\nfatal one.[73] It is also a most unfavorable sign when the teeth get\r\nvery dry.”\r\n\r\n“Necrosis of a tooth heals the abscess formed at the gum.[74] This is\r\nvery easily explained by the fall of the tooth. But Hippocrates knew\r\nvery well that the affection does not always take such a favorable\r\ncourse; he therefore adds, immediately after:\r\n\r\n“In the case of necrosis of a tooth the supervening of a strong fever\r\nwith delirium gives reason to fear a fatal exit. If, notwithstanding\r\nthis, the patient be saved, there will be suppuration and exfoliation\r\nof the bone.”[75]\r\n\r\nAccording to Hippocrates, “violent pains in the lower jaw give reason\r\nto fear a necrosis of the bone.”[76]\r\n\r\n“Gingival hemorrhage in cases of persistent diarrhea is an unfavorable\r\nsymptom.”[77] In fact, the easy and frequent occurring of hemorrhage of\r\nthe gums may, in many cases, be an indication of profound alteration\r\nof the blood, a condition serious in itself, but still more so when\r\nassociated with obstinate diarrhea.\r\n\r\nIn different parts of the books of Hippocrates, the influence of\r\natmospheric conditions on the production of dental and gingival\r\nmaladies is alluded to.\r\n\r\n“Much inconvenience was caused to various persons at that period of\r\ntime by swelling of the fauces, by inflammation of the tongue, by\r\nabscesses of the gums.”[78]\r\n\r\n“After the snow, there were west winds and light rains; colds in\r\nthe head, with or without fever, were very frequent; in one of the\r\npatients, pains were produced in the teeth on the right side, and in\r\nthe eye and eyebrow.”[79]\r\n\r\nIn more than one of his books Hippocrates speaks of special dental\r\nor gingival symptoms, having their origin in different maladies,\r\nespecially those of the spleen:\r\n\r\n“In many who have enlargement of the spleen the gums become affected\r\nand the mouth has a bad smell.”[80]\r\n\r\nIn another place we read:\r\n\r\n“Among those persons who have an enlargement of the spleen, the bilious\r\nones have a bad color, are subject to ulcerations of a bad nature,\r\ntheir breath is fetid, and they themselves are thin.”[81] Finally,\r\nin the _Book on Internal Diseases_, Hippocrates describes different\r\nspecies of splenic maladies, to one of which he assigns the following\r\nsymptoms:\r\n\r\n“The belly becomes swollen, the spleen enlarged and hard, the patient\r\nsuffers acute pain in it. The complexion of the individual is altered.\r\nA bad smell emanates from the ears. The gums are detached from the\r\nteeth and smell bad; the limbs wither, etc.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe cases of splenic swellings spoken of by Hippocrates in the above\r\npassages must have been owing, without doubt, to grave cachectic\r\nconditions (among which, probably, scurvy); and we know that\r\ngingivitis, with all its possible consequences (among which expulsive\r\nperiodontitis), is not only a constant symptom in scurvy, but is\r\nalso frequent in all diseases attended by profound disorders of\r\nnutrition.[83]\r\n\r\nSetting on edge of the teeth is counted by Hippocrates among the many\r\nsymptoms to which a protracted leucorrhea may give rise:\r\n\r\n“One should ask women who have been troubled for some time with a white\r\nflux whether they suffer from headache, pains in the kidneys and in\r\nthe lower part of the belly, as well as setting on edge of the teeth,\r\ndimming of the sight, singing in the ears.”[84]\r\n\r\nHippocrates had also observed that the phenomenon of setting the teeth\r\non edge (_stupor dentium_) may be produced as well by acids in general,\r\nalso by acid vomiting;[85] and that it may also be produced in many\r\nindividuals by a strident sound.[86]\r\n\r\nIn the second book of _Epidemics_ we find a proposition of the\r\nfollowing tenor:\r\n\r\n“Long-lived individuals have a greater number of teeth;”[87] which\r\nis as much as to say that “the having a greater number of teeth is a\r\nsign of longevity.” This prejudice is to be found repeated by many\r\nauthors subsequent to the epoch of Hippocrates, and among these by\r\nAristotle and Pliny. Not even the greatest men are infallible; there\r\nis, therefore, no reason to be scandalized if Hippocrates should really\r\nhave fallen into such an error. Anyhow, it should be observed that\r\nonly the first and the third book on _Epidemics_ are held to be really\r\nauthentic, while the other five were probably compiled by other doctors\r\nof the school of Hippocrates who did not limit themselves merely to\r\ngathering together the many isolated notes and observations left in\r\nwriting or derived from the oral teachings of their master, but took\r\nit upon themselves to introduce into the compilation something of\r\ntheir own besides. It is, therefore, anything but certain that the\r\nabove-mentioned error is really to be attributed to Hippocrates.\r\n\r\nThe probable origin of this prejudice, which certainly originated among\r\nthe people and was afterward accepted by the doctors, is easily to\r\nbe guessed at. Individuals blessed with dental arches of remarkable\r\nbeauty and perfection may sometimes convey the impression of having\r\na greater number of teeth than others, for those two rows of regular\r\nwhite teeth, close to one another, strike the optic sense much more\r\nvividly than teeth of the ordinary kind. This impression is somewhat\r\nanalogous, at least as regards color—to the optical illusion which\r\ncauses a white circle to appear larger than a black one of equal\r\ndiameter. Now, without doubt, individuals with a perfect denture are\r\nmostly healthy and well constituted, and, therefore, live longer, in\r\ngeneral, than others. It is also to be noted that these people usually\r\nkeep all their teeth to a more or less advanced age; and there is no\r\ndoubt that among adults of the same age, those who have a less number\r\nof teeth, by reason of having lost several of them, are, in general,\r\nindividuals whose organic constitutions are less good, whose health is\r\nless satisfactory, and who are, therefore, destined in all probability\r\nto live a shorter time than the others. It is, therefore, perfectly\r\ntrue, _but only in a certain and very limited sense_ that “long-lived\r\nindividuals have a greater number of teeth.”\r\n\r\nGeist-Jacobi, perhaps in order to dissipate the erroneous signification\r\nof the Hippocratic proposition cited above and to place in evidence\r\nthat part of it which may be true, has thought well to translate it\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n“He who lives long keeps many teeth.” But this translation does not\r\nrender faithfully the idea expressed in the original Greek, ὁι\r\nμαχρόβιοι πλείους ὁδόντας ἔχουσιν (literally, the long-lived have\r\nmore teeth); a proposition that the most celebrated commentators\r\nof Hippocrates interpret in the sense given by us, and which Litré\r\ntranslates excellently well in these words: “_Avoir des dents en plus\r\ngrand nombre est un signe de longévité_.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this prejudice, which survived vigorously for many\r\ncenturies, the regular number of teeth was not unknown at the time\r\nof Hippocrates. This is to be perceived from a brief treatise of the\r\nHippocratic collection, entitled _De hominis structura_, wherein is\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n“The teeth, together with the molars, are thirty-two.”\r\n\r\nAmong the many and many counsels of practical value registered in the\r\nworks of Hippocrates, the following deserves special mention:\r\n\r\n“When a person has an ulcer of long duration on the margin of the\r\ntongue, one should examine the teeth on that side, to see if some one\r\nof them does not, by chance, present a sharp point.”[88]\r\n\r\nIn fact, it not infrequently occurs that a lingual ulcer deriving from\r\nirritation produced by a broken or sharp tooth assumes a malignant\r\naspect that causes it to be mistaken for a cancerous ulcer, and\r\nmedical men may even be so far misled as to advise the extreme remedy\r\nof amputation of the tongue. If, however, the consulting surgeon has\r\nsome experience, he will not neglect in the first place to examine\r\naccurately the state of the patient’s teeth; it then mostly happens\r\nthat after the removal of the offending tooth a complete cure is\r\nobtained in a brief space of time. How much anxiety would not such poor\r\nsufferers be spared if physicians in general were acquainted with the\r\ncounsel given by Hippocrates twenty-four centuries ago!\r\n\r\nIn speaking of fracture of the lower jaw, Hippocrates recommends\r\nbinding the teeth next to the lesion together. He distinguishes between\r\nthe complete and the incomplete fracture; he then speaks separately of\r\nthe fracture of the symphysis. Treating of the incomplete fracture, he\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n“If the teeth in proximity of the lesion be shaken, one ought, after\r\nhaving reduced the fracture, to bind them one to the other, until the\r\nconsolidation of the bone, using preferably gold wire for the purpose;\r\nbut if this be wanting, linen thread can be used instead, and not only\r\nought the two teeth next to the site of the fracture to be bound, but\r\nseveral of the others besides.”[89]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9\r\n\r\nTwo Greek appliances existing in the Archæological Museum of Athens.]\r\n\r\nFarther on, when speaking of complete fractures, he renews this advice\r\nin these words:\r\n\r\n“After having carried out the coaptation, the teeth ought, as we have\r\nsaid already, to be bound one to the other; this greatly contributes\r\nto obtaining the immobility of the fragments, particularly if properly\r\ncarried out.”[90]\r\n\r\nAlso, in cases of fracture of the symphysis, Hippocrates recommends\r\n“binding the teeth together on the right and left of the lesion.” And\r\nafter having spoken of the best adapted means of constraint in such\r\nkinds of fractures, he adds: “If the reduction has been well performed,\r\nand the part kept in proper repose, the consolidation takes place in\r\na short time and the teeth do not undergo any damage; in the contrary\r\ncase, the cure is retarded, the fragments reunite in a bad position,\r\nand the teeth are injured and become useless.”[91]\r\n\r\nFrom what we have referred, it is easy to perceive how much importance\r\nHippocrates attached to the dental system, what knowledge he possessed\r\nas to the pathological conditions of the teeth, the gums, and the jaws,\r\nand what means of treatment he used. But in what relates to therapy it\r\nwill perhaps not be useless to make some further observations.\r\n\r\nOne of Hippocrates’ aphorisms says:\r\n\r\n“Cold is the enemy of the bones, the teeth, the nerves, the brain, and\r\nthe spinal marrow.”[92]\r\n\r\nFrom this it is easy to conclude that Hippocrates was no friend to\r\nhydrotherapic treatment, and that he considered the use of cold drinks\r\nbad for the teeth, and cold applications harmful in dental diseases.\r\n\r\nThe idea expressed in the aphorism just quoted is to be found repeated\r\nin the book entitled _On the Use of Liquids_;[93] and in this same\r\ntreatise we find _vinegar_ recommended shortly after in cases of\r\n_burning of the teeth_ (an expression probably meant to indicate those\r\npathological conditions of the teeth and gums which are accompanied by\r\na sense of burning).\r\n\r\nSome of the Hippocratic maxims, full of wisdom and good sense, will\r\nforever conserve their importance, whatever be the degree of perfection\r\nto which medical science may come.\r\n\r\n“Diseases, says he, should be combated in their origin;”[94] which\r\nis as much as to say, that it is not enough to apply symptomatic or\r\npalliative means of cure, but that it is necessary, rather to seek and\r\nto combat the true causes of disease. And in another place we find\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n“One should take care of two things in illnesses—to do good and not\r\nto do harm. The art of curing includes three terms: the malady, the\r\npatient, and the doctor. The latter is the minister of the art; the\r\npatient has to combat the malady together with him.”[95]\r\n\r\nIt is only too true, that not all the representatives of the healing\r\nart keep sufficiently in view the precept _to do good and not to do\r\nharm_; nor do all patients comport themselves in such a manner as to\r\ncontribute, in accordance with Hippocrates’ wise counsel, to the work\r\nof their own cure.\r\n\r\nARISTOTLE, the greatest philosopher of antiquity, was born at Stagira,\r\nin Macedonia, and lived from 384 to 322 B.C. He wrote most excellent\r\nworks on all branches of human knowledge, and was the founder of\r\nNatural History and Comparative Anatomy. His acquaintance with anatomy\r\nas illustrated principally in his treatise _On the Different Parts of\r\nAnimals_, is absolutely extraordinary for the time in which he lived.\r\nOne chapter of this work[96] is altogether dedicated to the study of\r\nthe teeth; but he also speaks of these organs in many other of his\r\nworks, particularly in his _History of Animals_, which is a real and\r\nproper treatise on zoölogy, wherein the author records a great number\r\nof notes about the peculiarities presented by the dental system, in the\r\ndifferent classes of animals.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the great errors into which he has fallen, his ideas about\r\nthe teeth are, taken as a whole, quite worthy of attention, especially\r\nwhen one considers the remote epoch in which this great philosopher\r\nwrote. We will here give a brief notice of the most important of his\r\nobservations relating to the dental organs.\r\n\r\nThe form, the disposition, the number of the teeth, varies in animals,\r\naccording to the quality of their food and according to whether the\r\nteeth serve merely to divide and to chew the alimentary substances, or\r\nas instruments of offence and defence as well. In man, the teeth serve\r\nprincipally for mastication, but the front ones have, besides, another\r\nmost important office, namely, that of assisting in the articulation of\r\nwords, in the pronunciation of certain letters.\r\n\r\nIn those animals in which the teeth also serve as weapons, it is to\r\nbe observed either that some of them protrude like those of the boar,\r\nor that they are sharp and saw-like in their disposition, as in the\r\nlion, the panther, the dog, etc. No animal possesses at the same time\r\nprotruding and saw-like teeth.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are not always equal in number in both jaws; the animals\r\nprovided with horns have no teeth in the front of the upper jaw; this,\r\nhowever, is also to be observed in animals without horns, as for\r\nexample, in the camel. Among the animals provided with horns there are\r\nnone which have protruding or saw-like teeth.\r\n\r\nIn general, the front teeth are pointed and the back ones broad.\r\nNevertheless, all the teeth of the seal are pointed, with a saw-like\r\ndisposition, perhaps because this animal marks the transition from the\r\nquadruped to the fish, all of which, with few exceptions, have their\r\nteeth formed in that way. Animals with saw-like teeth have generally\r\nvery large mouths.\r\n\r\nNo animal has ever more than one row of teeth in each jaw; however,\r\nsays Aristotle, if Ctesias[97] is to be believed, there is an animal in\r\nIndia, named marticora, which has a triple row of teeth.\r\n\r\nThe molar teeth are never changed either in man or in any known animal;\r\nthe pig never changes its teeth.\r\n\r\nOne can judge the age of many animals by their teeth. As the animal\r\ngrows older, the teeth become darker in color, except in the case of\r\nthe horse, whose teeth grow whiter with age.\r\n\r\nThe last molars are cut by men and women about the twentieth year; but\r\nin some cases, and especially with women, they have been known to come\r\nforth—not without pain—very much later, even so late as at eighty years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nThe man has more teeth than the woman; this peculiarity is also to be\r\nfound in the female of some animals (such as sheep, goats, and pigs).\r\n\r\nIndividuals provided with many teeth generally live the longest, those\r\ninstead who have fewer teeth (or simply far apart) are generally\r\nshorter lived.\r\n\r\nThe teeth are generated by the nourishment distributed in the jawbone;\r\nthey are, in consequence, of the same nature as bones. Their surface,\r\nhowever, is very much harder than that of the bones. The teeth,\r\ncontrarily to all other bones, grow throughout life, so as to provide\r\nfor their wearing away through mastication; and for this reason they\r\nlengthen when the antagonizing teeth are wanting.[98]\r\n\r\nThe teeth differ from all the other bones, therein that they are\r\ngenerated after the body has been already constituted; they are,\r\ntherefore, secondary formations; and precisely for this reason are able\r\nto be shed and to be renewed.\r\n\r\nSome of the veins of the head, says Aristotle, terminate with very\r\nslender branches inside the teeth.[99]\r\n\r\nThe dental system of the monkey is altogether similar to that of man.\r\n\r\nThe molar teeth exist in viviparous quadrupeds as well as in man; in\r\nthe oviparous quadrupeds and in fish they are wanting. They serve to\r\ngrind food, a function in which the lateral movements of the inferior\r\njaw have, in many animals, a large share. For this reason, in animals\r\nwho have no molars, these lateral movements do not exist.\r\n\r\nIn birds, the beak takes the place of the lips and teeth; the substance\r\nof which it is formed is similar to that of the horn or the nails.\r\n\r\nIn those animals which, instead of having all the teeth sharp, are\r\nfurnished with incisors, canines, and molars, these three species of\r\nteeth are disposed in the same order as in man.\r\n\r\nThe setting on edge of the teeth may be produced not only by eating\r\nacid things, but also simply by seeing them eaten. This sensation may\r\nbe made to cease by the use of purslane and salt.\r\n\r\nIn the book entitled _Problems_, many of which have reference to\r\nmedical matters, one is to be found to the following effect:\r\n\r\n“Why do figs, when they are soft and sweet, produce damage to the\r\nteeth?” Perhaps, answers Aristotle, because the viscous softness of\r\nthe fig causes small particles of its pulp to adhere to the gums and\r\ninsinuate themselves into the dental interstices, where they very\r\neasily become the cause of putrefactive processes. But, he adds, it may\r\nalso be that harm is produced to the teeth by masticating the small\r\nhard grains of this fruit.\r\n\r\nIn Aristotle’s _Mechanics_, the following question relative to the\r\nextraction of the teeth is discussed:\r\n\r\n“Why do doctors extract teeth more easily by adding the weight of the\r\nodontagra (dental forceps) than by using the hand only? Can it be said\r\nthat this occurs because the tooth escapes from the hand more easily\r\nthan from the forceps? Ought not the irons to slip off the tooth more\r\neasily than the fingers, whose tips being soft can be applied around\r\nabout the tooth much better? The dental forceps,” adds Aristotle, “is\r\nformed by two levers, acting in contrary sense and having a single\r\nfulcrum represented by the commissure of the instrument. By means\r\nof this double lever it is much easier to move the tooth, but after\r\nhaving moved it, it is easier to extract it with the hand than with the\r\ninstrument.”\r\n\r\nFrom this passage of Aristotle one may draw various conclusions. First\r\nof all, it appears that, at that time, the extraction of teeth was\r\na common enough operation carried out by doctors in general, or, at\r\nleast, by specialists not indicated by any particular denomination\r\nbut called doctors (in Greek, ιατροι) just the same as those\r\nwho dealt with the maladies of every other part of the body. If,\r\ntherefore (which, however, is very doubtful), there existed in Greece,\r\nas there certainly did in Egypt, individuals who occupied themselves\r\n_exclusively_ with the treatment of the teeth, they cannot have formed\r\na distinct class of professionals, but merely a section of the medical\r\nclass. Herodotus, too, as we have already seen, does not say, speaking\r\nof Egypt, that there was a proper class of dentists, but gives us\r\nto understand that the Egyptian doctors did not occupy themselves\r\nindiscriminately with the treatment of all maladies, for some dedicated\r\nthemselves to curing the eyes, others to the treatment of maladies of\r\nthe head, others to those of the teeth, and so on.\r\n\r\nFrom the Aristotelian passage on the extraction of teeth, just quoted,\r\nit may be concluded that in those times the Hippocratic precept, that\r\nonly loose teeth were to be extracted, was not observed, for otherwise,\r\nAristotle could not have said that dental forceps are useful to loosen\r\nthe teeth, but that after this has been done the extraction of the\r\ntooth may be more easily effected by means of the fingers than with the\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nThis last assertion appears very strange. It demonstrates that either\r\nthe instruments then in use were very imperfect, or that Aristotle,\r\nalthough the son of a doctor and himself possessed of vast medical\r\nknowledge, had absolutely no experience as to the extraction of teeth;\r\nand, therefore, speaking theoretically, and without any practical\r\nbasis, he ran into error, as even the greatest men are apt to do when\r\ndrawing conclusions from purely theoretical reasonings.\r\n\r\nFrom Aristotle to Galen, that is, for the space of five centuries,\r\nthe anatomy of the dental system, so far as may be deduced from the\r\nwritings preserved to us, made no sensible progress. But in respect\r\nto this, one must take into consideration some historical facts of\r\ncapital importance. The school of medicine of Alexandria, which arose\r\nabout three centuries before Christ, numbered among its most brilliant\r\nluminaries the celebrated doctors Herophilus and Erasistratus, who\r\nwere the initiators of the dissection of human corpses,[100] thus\r\ngiving a great impulse to anatomical research. It is, therefore, hardly\r\nadmissible that these two great anatomists, who studied with profound\r\nattention even the most complicated internal organs, should have\r\nneglected the anatomy of the teeth. Unfortunately, however, not all the\r\nresults of their researches have come down to us; nor is this to be\r\nwondered at, especially if we reflect on the large number of precious\r\nworks entirely lost by the destruction of the celebrated library of\r\nAlexandria, A.D. 642.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to speak of Archigenes, we shall see how he, in certain\r\ncases, advised trepanning the teeth. This would lead to the belief that\r\nin his times, viz., toward the end of the first century after Christ,\r\nthe existence of the central cavity of the tooth was not ignored, and\r\nthat, therefore, the structure of these organs had already been the\r\nobject of study.\r\n\r\nAs to diseases of the teeth and their treatment, there is no doubt that\r\nHerophilus and Erasistratus must have occupied themselves with these\r\nsubjects; and the same may be asserted of Heraclides of Tarentum, a\r\ncelebrated doctor who lived in the third century before the Christian\r\nera. Indeed, we read in Cœlius Aurelianus,[101] that the record had\r\ncome down through the works of Herophilus and Heraclides of Tarentum,\r\nof persons having died by the extraction of a tooth.[102] The same\r\nwriter also alludes to a passage of Erasistratus, relating to the\r\n_odontagogon_ already mentioned, which was exhibited in the temple\r\nof Apollo, and to the practical signification to be attributed to\r\nthe fact of this instrument being of lead and not of hard metal. Now,\r\nif Herophilus, Heraclides of Tarentum, and Erasistratus all spoke of\r\nthe serious peril to which the extraction of a tooth may give rise,\r\nand therefore recommended not having recourse to it too lightly, it\r\nis evident that they had given serious attention to this operation\r\nand consequently also to the morbid conditions that may render it\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nDENTAL ART AMONG THE ETRUSCANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch earlier than the foundation of Rome (B.C. 753) there flourished\r\nin that part of Middle Italy today called Tuscany the highly civilized\r\npeople known by the name of Etruscans or Toschi. Their political\r\norganization had the form of a confederation of twelve principal\r\ncities,[103] the federal capital being Tarquinii. The Etruscan people\r\nwere industrious, intelligent, and artistic in the highest degree,\r\npossessing special skill in the decorative arts, splendid monuments,\r\nsome of which still remain to us; they were fond of luxury in all its\r\nmanifestations, and took great care of their persons; at the same time,\r\nhowever, they were a laborious and courageous race, not only most\r\nactive and enterprising in agriculture, in art and commerce, but also\r\nbrave warriors and hardy navigators.\r\n\r\nIn their long sea voyages the Etruscans frequently visited Egypt and\r\nPhœnicia, trading especially in the more flourishing cities, which\r\nwere at that time Memphis in Egypt, and Tyre and Sidon in Phœnicia.\r\nOn the other hand, the Phœnicians, who were also active merchants and\r\nnavigators, not only visited Etruria and other regions of Italy very\r\nfrequently, but also established numerous colonies in many islands of\r\nthe Mediterranean, and especially in those nearer to Italy.\r\n\r\nThis continual intercourse between Etruscans, on the one side, and\r\nEgyptians and Phœnicians, on the other, accounts for the great\r\ninfluence exercised by the Egyptian and Phœnician civilization upon\r\nthe later developed Etruscan culture—an influence manifesting itself\r\nvery distinctly in the works of art of the latter, which often have an\r\naltogether Oriental character, and not seldom represent scenes drawn\r\nfrom the domestic life of the Egyptians and Phœnicians.[104]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10, FIG. 11, FIG. 12\r\n\r\nDentures in terra-cotta, such as the Etruscans used to present to their\r\ndivinities as votive offerings in order to be cured, or after having\r\nbeen cured of dental maladies.]\r\n\r\nAs to what concerns dental art, everything leads up to the belief that\r\nit was practised by the Egyptians and Phœnicians earlier than by the\r\nEtruscans, whose civilization, as already hinted, is certainly less\r\nancient. Nevertheless, in comparing the dental appliances found in the\r\nEtruscan tombs with the sole authentic dental appliance of Phœnician\r\nworkmanship known at the present day,[105] we cannot but be struck\r\nwith the great superiority of the Etruscan appliances. It is therefore\r\nprobable that the Etruscans, although they had learned the dental art\r\nfrom the Egyptians and Phœnicians, had subsequently carried it to a\r\nmuch higher degree of perfection than it had arrived at in Egypt or in\r\nPhœnicia. An analogous fact has come to pass in our own times. Dental\r\nart in America, which emanated from the French and English schools,\r\nsoon took on so vigorous a development as indisputably to acquire first\r\nrank.\r\n\r\nBefore describing in detail the dental appliances found up to now in\r\nEtruscan tombs, we will consider a question touching very closely upon\r\nthe argument which we are treating and which has already been discussed\r\nin Professor Deneffe’s book, already cited.\r\n\r\nHow is it that the dental appliances of the Phœnicians, Greeks,\r\nEtruscans, and Romans should have come down to us, notwithstanding\r\ncremation?\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if one reflects that the teeth offer an altogether\r\nspecial resistance to the action of fire, and if one also remembers\r\nthat gold was the substance employed for the construction of the\r\nappliances in question, and that this metal does not melt save at a\r\nvery high temperature, it no longer appears marvellous if, in many\r\ncases at least, the dental appliances should have been able to resist\r\nthe cremating process.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the cremation may possibly sometimes have been\r\nincomplete—that is to say, the skeleton may not have been altogether\r\nreduced to ashes; therefore, among the residuum of this incomplete\r\ncombustion, a piece of a jaw may easily have remained, and incidentally\r\nalso its prosthetic appliance.\r\n\r\nBut besides all this, it must be considered that the custom of burning\r\ncorpses was not at all general among ancient people. Indeed, cremation\r\nwas not in use either among the Egyptians, the Phœnicians, the Hebrews,\r\nor the Chinese; the Greeks only resorted to it in exceptional cases.\r\nThe most ancient tombs of the Etruscans show that at the epoch of their\r\nsettling in Italy, cremation was in general use among them. But little\r\nby little, as they entered into commercial relations with the Egyptian,\r\nthe Phœnician, and the Greek peoples, who did not burn their dead, the\r\ncustom of burial substituted that of cremation. Toward the end of the\r\nsixth century before Christ there were to be found in southern Etruria,\r\none beside the other, tombs for the burial of corpses and others for\r\ncremation.\r\n\r\nOne sometimes finds in one and the same tomb a cinerarium (urn for\r\nconserving ashes) and skeletons enclosed in sarcophagi or resting on\r\nmortuary couches.\r\n\r\nAt Tarquinii and Orvieto burial generally prevails.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth century B.C., the epoch in which the Law of the Twelve\r\nTables was promulgated, burial and cremation were equally in use among\r\nthe Romans. In the second century of the Christian era burial was\r\nalready prevalent, and through the influence of Christianity became\r\ngeneral during the third and fourth centuries.[106]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13\r\n\r\nTooth crowns found in an Etruscan tomb of the ancient\r\nVitulonia (Archæological Museum of Florence). The\r\nenamel-capsules of these teeth (four molars and one\r\ncanine) are perfectly well preserved, whilst the ivory\r\nhas entirely disappeared.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14\r\n\r\nThe same tooth crowns of the preceding figure, seen from\r\nthe side of the concavity of the enamel capsules.]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding cremation, which certainly must have destroyed a great\r\nnumber of the dental appliances of that time, and in spite of the many\r\ndifferent destructive agents which successively did their work on those\r\nhuman remains during so many centuries, not a few prosthetic pieces of\r\nEtruscan workmanship have come down to us; from which we may argue that\r\ndental prosthesis was not an exceptional fact among this people, as\r\nsome may perhaps suppose, but, on the contrary, must have been a very\r\nusual practice.\r\n\r\nThe dental appliances discovered up to now among Etruscan remains are\r\npreserved in different Italian museums, with the exception of some few\r\nexisting in private collections or of others that have passed out of\r\nItaly into other countries.\r\n\r\nIn the museum of Pope Julius in Rome there is a dental appliance found\r\nat Valsiarosa in one of the many Etruscan tombs excavated in that\r\nlocality near Civita Castellana, the ancient Falerii (Fig. 15). This\r\nappliance is formed by a series of four gold rings meant to encircle\r\nfour teeth (canine, bicuspids, and first molar). The third ring is\r\ntraversed by a pivot riveted at the two extremities, which was meant to\r\nhold fast an artificial tooth (the second bicuspid); this is wanting,\r\nhowever. One naturally puts the question. How is the disappearance of\r\nthis tooth to be accounted for, it having been traversed by the pivot,\r\nwhich is still found in its place? The suppositions are two: Either the\r\nartificial tooth was made of some not very durable material, which, in\r\nthe course of time, became reduced to powder or fell to pieces, or may\r\nhave been destroyed in some other way; or else the artificial tooth,\r\ninstead of being simply perforated to allow the pivot to pass through,\r\nwas cleft longitudinally at its base and, being introduced into the\r\nring sat, so to speak, astride the pivot. In the second case, which,\r\nhowever, seems to me the less probable of the two, the tooth may merely\r\nhave come off the pivot and gotten lost.\r\n\r\nIn the Civic Museum of Corneto, the ancient Tarquinii, there are two\r\ndental appliances, one of which (Figs. 16 and 17) is of the greatest\r\ninterest. It was found in one of the most ancient tombs in the\r\nnecropolis of Tarquinii. This specimen of prosthesis is formed of three\r\nteeth; the two upper central incisors and the second bicuspid on the\r\nleft, which is no longer in existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance found at Valsiarosa, destined to support an\r\nartificial bicuspid, now disappeared.]\r\n\r\nTo afford support and maintain the three artificial teeth in position,\r\nthe Etruscan dentist of about three thousand years ago, ingeniously\r\nmade use of the canine and the lateral incisor on the right, the\r\ncanine, the first bicuspid, and the first molar on the left, connecting\r\nthem by a continuous series of pure gold rings soldered together. The\r\ndentist had not employed human teeth to replace the incisors which\r\nthe individual had lost; according to the religious laws of the time,\r\nthe dead were held sacred, and it would probably have been considered\r\nsacrilege to use their teeth; or it may also be that the patient had\r\ndeclared his aversion to the idea of substituting his own teeth by\r\nthose of a dead man. However this may be, the Etruscan dentist thought\r\nwell to replace the missing incisors with a somewhat large ox tooth;\r\nupon this he had made a groove, so as to give it the appearance of two\r\nteeth. In reality this ox tooth occupies the place not only of the two\r\nmiddle incisors, but also of the lateral incisor on the left. Perhaps\r\nby a natural anomaly the individual may never have had this tooth; or,\r\nmore probably still, some length of time may have elapsed between the\r\nloss of one of the three and the other two, so that when he made up his\r\nmind to have recourse to a prosthetic appliance, the space normally\r\noccupied by the three incisors was already notably diminished, and\r\nthe void could therefore be filled by an ox tooth so adjusted as to\r\nrepresent only two teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance for supporting three artificial teeth, two of which\r\nwere made of one ox tooth. (Civic Museum of Corneto.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17\r\n\r\nThe same appliance reversed.]\r\n\r\nWhen I was intrusted with the reproduction of all the ancient\r\nprosthetic pieces existing in the Italian museums, I met with special\r\ndifficulty in the reproduction of the above-mentioned piece; and this\r\nbecause I could not succeed in procuring an ox tooth that was not\r\nworn away by the effects of mastication. The idea then occurred to me\r\nof sectioning the upper jaw of a calf at about the age of the second\r\ndentition, and taking out the teeth, which were already strong and well\r\nformed, but not yet deteriorated by mastication. I fancy my Etruscan\r\ncolleague must have done the same three thousand years ago, when he\r\ncarried out the prosthesis in question, for the large tooth employed by\r\nhim does not show any signs of being worn by mastication.\r\n\r\nThis large tooth is solidly fixed by means of two pivots to the gold\r\nband that encircles it. Another pivot served to fix the second\r\nbicuspid, also artificial. This tooth, as already stated, has now\r\ndisappeared, but the pivot that fixed it to its ring is still in its\r\nplace. In carrying out this prosthesis the dentist has contrived the\r\nseries of rings that support the teeth in such a manner that they\r\nremained above the gum, and thus the harmful effects of contact and of\r\nthe pressure of an extraneous body was avoided. At the same time, this\r\narrangement, by distancing the rings from the dental neck that narrows\r\noff conically, added to the firmness of the prosthesis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance for supporting two inserted human teeth, one of\r\nwhich is now wanting. (Civic Museum of Corneto.)]\r\n\r\nAnother dental appliance (Fig. 18) which is in the custody of the Civic\r\nMuseum of Corneto, was also found in a very old Etruscan tomb. It is\r\nformed by two bands of rolled gold; one of these is labial, the other\r\nlingual, and they are soldered together at their extremities, forming\r\nby the help of four partitions, also of gold, five square spaces. Three\r\nof these served for the reception of the natural teeth supporting\r\nthe prosthesis; the other two maintained, by means of pivots, two\r\ninserted human teeth; one of these is lost; the other is still in\r\nits place, solidly fixed by its pivot. These inserted human teeth,\r\nby the religious laws we have before mentioned, could not have been\r\ntaken from corpses; probably they belonged to the person himself, and\r\nhaving fallen out through alveolitis, had been reapplied in the manner\r\ndescribed above.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance supporting one inserted tooth (upper middle incisor\r\non the right) which is now disappeared. (Museum of the Conte Bruschi at\r\nCorneto.)]\r\n\r\nTwo Etruscan dental appliances are to be found in the Museum of the\r\nConte Bruschi at Corneto: one is similar to those already described,\r\nand the other, instead, is of a special kind. The first (Fig. 19) is\r\nformed by a series of four rings, embracing the upper canine on the\r\nright and the three neighboring incisors. It was destined to support\r\na single inserted tooth, the middle incisor on the right; this has\r\ndisappeared, while the pivot by which it was fixed to the ring is still\r\nthere, as well as the three natural teeth that afforded support to the\r\nappliance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance intended to avoid the bad effects of convergence,\r\nor, perhaps, to support a purely ornamental artificial substitute.\r\n(Museum of Conte Bruschi at Corneto.)]\r\n\r\nThe other appliance (Fig. 20) is formed by two rings; the one surrounds\r\nthe left upper canine, the other the left middle incisor. Between these\r\ntwo rings there is not the usual ring crossed by a pivot, but simply\r\na small horizontal bar of gold soldered to the two rings. I suppose\r\nthat the person not liking to wear false teeth (one meets with this\r\nrepugnance also at the present day), the dentist has limited himself to\r\nputting a horizontal bar of gold between the two teeth on either side\r\nof the missing one, in order to maintain them in their normal position\r\nand so avoid the bad effects of convergence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21\r\n\r\nDental appliance still adhering to the jaw, discovered in an Etruscan\r\nnecropolis near Orvieto, and now in the possession of the Ghent\r\nUniversity.]\r\n\r\nAnother ancient dental appliance discovered in an Etruscan necropolis\r\nnear Orvieto is now in the possession of the Ghent University, to\r\nwhich it was sold.[107] It still adheres to a piece of upper jaw (Fig.\r\n21), in which there are four teeth on each side, that is, on the right,\r\nthe canine, the two bicuspids, and the first molar; on the left, the\r\ncanine, the second bicuspid, and the two first molars. The alveoli of\r\nthe four incisors are of normal width and depth, this signifying that\r\nthese teeth remained in their places until the end of life. The dental\r\nappliance, still supported by this fragment of a jaw, is made of the\r\npurest gold. It is composed of a small band curved back upon itself,\r\nthe ends being soldered together, and, by the aid of two partitions,\r\nalso of pure gold, it forms three compartments, two small lateral\r\nones, and one centre one of double the size. The lateral compartment\r\non the right contains the canine of the same side; that on the left\r\nmust have contained the left central incisor, that has now disappeared,\r\nwhile the large central compartment must evidently have contained the\r\ntwo incisors on the right side. As there is no pivot in the whole\r\nappliance, and as the alveoli are not obliterated, there can be no\r\ndoubt that the appliance was simply destined to prevent the loss of the\r\ntwo right incisors by keeping them steady.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22\r\n\r\nThe same piece as in the preceding figure, seen from the palatal side.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted, with regard to the Etruscan dental appliances above\r\ndescribed, that the gold bands of which they were constructed covered\r\na considerable part of the dental crown, so that these prosthetic\r\nappliances certainly could not have had the pretension of escaping\r\nthe notice of others, they being, on the contrary, most visible. It\r\nis in consequence to be surmised that in those times the wearing of\r\nfalse teeth and other kinds of dental appliance was not a thing to be\r\nashamed of; indeed, that it rather constituted a luxury, a sort of\r\nrefinement only accessible to persons of means. Besides this, as the\r\ngold in which these works were carried out was of the purest quality\r\nand in consequence very soft, the appliances would not have possessed\r\nsufficient solidity if the softness of the pure gold had not been\r\ncounteracted by the width and thickness of the bands or strips.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23\r\n\r\nEtruscan appliance (found in 1865 in a tomb by Cervetri), destined\r\nperhaps to support a purely ornamental artificial substitute.\r\n(Belonging to Castellani’s collection, Rome.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24\r\n\r\nA reproduction of the gold piece forming the appliance seen in Fig. 23.]\r\n\r\nIn those of the Etruscan appliances destined for the application of\r\ninserted teeth, the gum was not made to support the prosthesis, and did\r\nnot, therefore, suffer any compression from the extraneous body, this\r\nresting entirely, like a bridge, upon the neighboring teeth. From which\r\nit may be seen that twenty-five centuries and more before our time the\r\nEtruscans dentists already practised a system of bridge work, and,\r\nrelatively to the age, carried it out with sufficient ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many centuries the Romans, according to the saying of Pliny,\r\nlived entirely “without doctors, although not without medicine;”[108]\r\nthat is, there existed without doubt a popular medicine and also a\r\nsacerdotal medicine, but still there were no persons whose exclusive\r\noccupation it was to cure disease.\r\n\r\nThe medical art, properly so called, was introduced into Rome by the\r\nGreeks. The first Greek doctor who went to Rome was Archagathus (in the\r\nyear 535 after the foundation of the city, that is, 218 years before\r\nChrist). His arrival was at first welcomed, so much so that he was made\r\na Roman citizen and a shop bought for him in the Acilian square, at the\r\nexpense of the State. However, his popularity was of brief duration.\r\nBeing an intrepid operator, the use and abuse he made of steel and fire\r\ngained for him the not very honorable qualification of the butcher, and\r\nhe soon became the horror of all the population.\r\n\r\nBut it appears that dentistry had begun to be practised in Rome\r\nprior to the coming of Archagathus, that is, long before the medical\r\nprofession existed. We have the clear proof of this in the Law of the\r\nTwelve Tables, wherein we find mention made of teeth bound with gold.\r\nThe Law of the Twelve Tables was written in Rome 450 years before\r\nChrist, by a body of ten magistrates (_decemviri_) expressly named for\r\nthat purpose, as up to that time no written law had existed.\r\n\r\nAs gold was at that time somewhat scarce, and fears were entertained\r\nthat it would become still scarcer (to the great damage of the State)\r\nby reason of the custom that prevailed among the wealthy of burning\r\nor burying gold articles with the corpses to honor the memory of the\r\ndeceased, or, rather, to satisfy the pride of the survivors, it was\r\nthought necessary to prohibit this abuse by a special disposition\r\nof the law referring to funeral pomps. This disposition was thus\r\nformulated: “_Neve aurum addito, ast quoi auro dentes iuncti escunt\r\n(sunt) im cum illo sepelirei vrive sine fraude esto_;”[109] that is,\r\n“Neither shall gold be added thereto (to the corpse); but it shall not\r\nbe unlawful to bury or to burn it with the gold with which the teeth\r\nmay perchance be bound together.”\r\n\r\nFrom this it results that at the time when the Law of the Twelve Tables\r\nwas written, that is, four centuries and a half before the Christian\r\nera, there were already individuals in Rome who practised dental\r\noperations. And these individuals cannot have been medical men, as at\r\nthat epoch (corresponding pretty nearly with the date of Hippocrates’\r\nbirth) Rome had as yet no doctors.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry naturally suggests itself whether the gold mentioned in the\r\nlegal dispositions above cited was used for fixing artificial teeth or\r\nsimply for strengthening unsteady natural teeth. Some authors, Serre\r\namong them,[110] have pronounced in favor of the first hypothesis,\r\nothers, as, for example, Geist-Jacobi,[111] are rather disposed to\r\naccept the second. In truth, however, we do not possess sufficient\r\nhistorical data to definitely resolve this problem. I myself am rather\r\nof opinion that artificial teeth were already in use in Rome, as they\r\nwere, even before this time, among the Etruscans. Indeed, if we take\r\ninto consideration the priority of the Etruscan civilization to the\r\nRoman and the relations of vicinity existing between Etruria and the\r\nRoman State, of which it afterward became a part, it is even possible\r\nthat dental prosthesis was first practised in Rome by Etruscans.\r\n\r\nIn a Greek-Roman necropolis near Teano (Province of Caserta, Italy)\r\nthere was found in February, 1907, a prosthetic piece of a very\r\npeculiar construction, and which may be considered as quite unique in\r\nits kind. It is an appliance destined to support three inserted human\r\nteeth (the two lower central incisors and the lateral incisor on the\r\nright). These teeth—lost perhaps by the patient himself, in consequence\r\nof alveolar pyorrhea—were fixed by means of a system of rings, made of\r\nlaminated gold wire, turned around the teeth and then soldered.\r\n\r\nBy the examination of the piece it is easy to argue that the author of\r\nthis prosthesis made at first three separate rings by tightly turning\r\nthe laminated gold wire around each of the three teeth to be applied,\r\nand by soldering together the ends of the wire forming each ring, after\r\nhaving taken away the tooth, in order not to spoil it in making the\r\nsoldering. Then, with another laminated gold wire of sufficient length,\r\nhe soldered the three rings together in due position, put the appliance\r\nin the mouth and turned the two ends of the wire around the sound\r\nteeth, serving as a support for the lateral incisor on the left and\r\nthe two canines. After this, he took the apparatus delicately out of\r\nthe mouth, made the soldering necessary for finishing the skeleton of\r\nthe apparatus, forcibly put the three teeth in their respective rings\r\nagain, and applied the prosthesis.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious appliance was found still adherent to the mandible of a\r\nskeleton, in a tomb which, according to the eminent archæologist Dalli\r\nOsso, belongs to a period comprised between the third and the fourth\r\ncentury before Christ.\r\n\r\nFrom the nature of the objects found in the tomb near the skeleton (a\r\nnecklace, perfume vessels, etc.) it was quite evident that the skeleton\r\nbearing the above-described prosthesis was that of a woman.\r\n\r\nAs the said appliance was found in South Italy (the ancient “Magna\r\nGræcia”) it is quite probable that it was made by some dentist of the\r\nGreek colonies.\r\n\r\nThe above apparatus belongs to the archæological collection of Signor\r\nLuigi Nobile, in Teano, in whose possession it was found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25\r\n\r\nSeen from behind.\r\n\r\nFIG. 26\r\n\r\nSeen from above.\r\n\r\nA prosthetic piece of very peculiar construction (see description),\r\nfound in 1907 near Teano, Italy.]\r\n\r\nThe Romans, as well as the Hebrews, and other peoples of antiquity,\r\nattributed great importance to the integrity of the dental system. This\r\nmay be deduced with certainty from another article in the Law of the\r\nTwelve Tables (Table VII, at the rubric _De delictis_), which says:\r\n“_Qui dentem ex gingiva excusserit libero homini, trecentis assibus\r\nmultator, qui servo C L._” (Whoever shall cause the tooth of a free man\r\nto fall shall pay a fine of three hundred _as_, and for that of a slave\r\none hundred and fifty.) The _as_ was worth about ten cents American\r\nmoney, so that the first fine amounted to about thirty dollars and the\r\nsecond to about fifteen dollars. These sums, because of the difference\r\nin the monetary value in those times, were considered heavy fines.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans had conquered Greece (146 B.C.) a very great number\r\nof Greek doctors went to Rome. The wealth, luxury, and ever-increasing\r\ncorruption of the metropolis caused the practice of the medical art\r\n(which was almost entirely in the hands of the Greeks) to become a\r\ngreat source of lucre. But an art practised with the sole purpose\r\nof making money soon degenerates to the level of a trade; it is,\r\ntherefore, hardly to be wondered at if very few doctors of that epoch\r\nhave merited being recorded in history.\r\n\r\nAmong these few, the name Asclepiades (born at Prusa, in Asia Minor;\r\ndied in Rome ninety-six years B.C.) shines with particular lustre. He\r\nwas the founder of the “methodic school,” whose curative precepts,\r\nlargely based upon hygiene, come nearer to those of modern scientific\r\nmedicine. Unfortunately, all the writings of this great physician,\r\nwhose name is almost as glorious as that of Hippocrates, have been\r\nlost; we do not know, therefore, whether and in how far he contributed\r\nto the development of our specialty.\r\n\r\nBut one of the first places in the history of dental art is due without\r\ndoubt to Cornelius Celsus, of whom we will now speak.\r\n\r\nCORNELIUS CELSUS. The historical researches in regard to the life of\r\nthis celebrated author have given but meagre results. It is uncertain\r\nwhether his birthplace was Rome or Verona. The precise dates of his\r\nbirth and death are also unknown; but it is very probable that he was\r\nborn about thirty years before Christ, and that he died during the\r\nfifth decade of the first century.\r\n\r\nAulus Cornelius Celsus belonged to the illustrious patrician family of\r\nthe Cornelii. He was a man of great erudition, and wrote on the most\r\nvaried subjects, and among others, on agriculture, on rhetoric, on the\r\nart of warfare, on medicine, etc. All these writings, however, are lost\r\nto us excepting his excellent treatise on medicine.\r\n\r\nSome historians consider that Celsus was a true doctor by profession;\r\nothers, instead, hold that he never undertook the cure of the sick.\r\nNeither the one nor the other of these opinions is quite acceptable;\r\nand it is much more likely, as Daremberg observes in his valuable\r\n_Histoire des Sciences Médicales_, that Celsus was one of those\r\nphiliatri mentioned by Galen, who had studied medicine rather from\r\nbooks than at the bedside of the sick, but who, although not doctors by\r\nprofession, in case of necessity, put their knowledge and skill into\r\npractice on behalf of their relations and friends.[112]\r\n\r\nThe work of Celsus, gathered in great part from Greek authors, has an\r\nespecial value, because it sums up, in an admirable manner, the whole\r\nof the medical and surgical science of the ancients, from the earliest\r\ntimes up to the days of Augustus.\r\n\r\nThe first book of the work _De Medicina_[113] does not contain anything\r\nof great importance in regard to dentistry. The following hygienic\r\nprecept is, however, worthy of note: “After rising, if it be not\r\nwinter, the mouth should be rinsed with a quantity of fresh water.”\r\nIn regard to the hygiene of the mouth, nothing more is found in the\r\nwork of Celsus; and it is also necessary to note that the aforesaid\r\nprecept forms part of a chapter, in which he speaks of the rules of\r\nlife, which must be observed by weak people, to which class—the author\r\nremarks—belong a greater part of the inhabitants of cities and almost\r\nall literary men. According to Celsus, therefore, perfectly healthy\r\nand strong people would not even need to wash their mouths with fresh\r\nwater, and perhaps the keen-witted Roman doctor was not wrong; for it\r\nis very probable that the saliva and mucous secretion of the mouth,\r\nin perfectly healthy individuals with normal constitutions, have the\r\npower of combating the pathogenic germs that produce caries and other\r\ndiseases of the teeth and mouth. In this way the fact can be explained\r\nof many peasants and the greater part of the individuals of the negro\r\nrace having such good teeth, without possessing even the remotest idea\r\nof what hygiene of the mouth may be. And here I venture to refer to a\r\npassage in which Celsus alludes to the relation between diseases and\r\ncivilization with its vices: “It is probable that in ancient times,\r\nalthough there was but little knowledge of medicine, health was for\r\nthe most part well preserved; this being due to good habits, not yet\r\nspoiled by intemperance and idleness. These two vices, first in Greece\r\nand then among us, have brought upon us a very host of evils; whence it\r\nis that in our days, in spite of the intricate art of medicine—once not\r\nnecessary to us, as it is not necessary to other peoples—few among us\r\nattain the beginning of old age.”[114]\r\n\r\nIn the second book, speaking of the various kinds of disease to which\r\nthe different periods of life are subject, he writes: “Children are\r\nespecially subject to serpiginous ulcers of the mouth, called by the\r\nGreeks aphthæ.... There are also infirmities due to dentition, such as\r\nulceration of the gums, convulsions, fever, looseness of the bowels;\r\nand it is especially the eruption of the canine teeth which produces\r\nthese disturbances. To these, however, very fat children are more\r\nparticularly liable, and those, also, who have costive bowels.”\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXV of the fifth book we find the receipt for a narcotic\r\ndrug, recommended by the author for producing sleep in persons\r\ntormented with odontalgic and other pains. This receipt is very\r\ncomplicated, being composed of ten ingredients, among which are acorns,\r\ncastoreum, cinnamon, poppy, mandrake, and pepper.\r\n\r\nMost important for our subject is Chapter IX, of the sixth book, where\r\nthe author treats of odontalgia. “In toothache, which may be numbered\r\namong the worst of tortures, the patient,” says Celsus, “must abstain\r\nentirely from wine, and at first, even from food; afterward, he may\r\npartake of soft food, but very sparingly, so as not to irritate the\r\nteeth by mastication. Meanwhile by means of a sponge he must let the\r\nsteam of hot water reach the affected part, and apply externally,\r\non the side corresponding with the pain, a cerate of cypress or of\r\niris, upon which he must then place some wool and keep the head well\r\ncovered up. But when the pain is violent, the use of purgatives is\r\nvery beneficial, the application of hot cataplasms on the cheek, and\r\nthe keeping in the mouth of some hot liquid, prepared with fitting\r\nmedicine, changing this liquid, however, very frequently. For this\r\npurpose the root of cinquefoil may be boiled in wine, or that of\r\nhyoscyamus (henbane), or a poppy-head, seedless and not too dry, or\r\nthe root of the mandrake. But in regard to the last three remedies,\r\none must be careful not to swallow the decoction whilst it is kept\r\nin the mouth. For the same purpose one may boil the bark of the root\r\nof the white poplar in wine, or the scrapings off a stag’s horn in\r\nvinegar or figs in mulse[115] or in vinegar and honey. It is useful\r\nalso to pass repeatedly around the tooth the end of a probe which has\r\nfirst been wrapped around with wool and then dipped in hot oil. It is\r\ncustomary also to apply around the tooth certain remedies, after the\r\nmanner of plasters. For this purpose the inside of the peel of dried,\r\nbitter pomegranates may be pounded with equal quantities of gall-nut\r\nand pine bark; to these must be added a little minium[116] and the\r\nwhole mixed together with the addition of rain water to form a paste;\r\nor else a similar paste may be formed with equal parts of panax,[117]\r\npoppy, peucedanum,[118] and taminia grape[119] without stones; or with\r\nthree parts of galbanum to one of poppy. On the cheek, however, must be\r\napplied at the same time the cerate spoken of above, covered over with\r\nwool.”\r\n\r\nCelsus then speaks of a revulsive adopted, in his times, against\r\nodontalgia. It was composed of myrrh and cardamom, _ana_ one part;\r\nsaffron, pyrethrum, figs, pepper, _ana_ four parts; mustard seed,\r\neight parts. The plaster, spread on linen, was to be applied on the\r\nshoulder corresponding to the side of the pain, and, according as this\r\nwas situated in a tooth of the upper or lower jaw, the revulsive was\r\napplied on the back of the shoulder, or in front.\r\n\r\nWhen a tooth is decayed, Celsus advises that there should be no haste\r\nin drawing it; but that the pain be combated, if the above medicines\r\nare not sufficient, with others more energetic. A mixture may, for\r\nexample be applied to the tooth, composed of one part of poppy, two\r\nof pepper, and ten of sory,[120] pounded and mixed to a paste with\r\ngalbanum; or else, especially in the case of a molar tooth, the remedy\r\nof Menemacus, resulting from saffron, one part; cardamom, soot from\r\nincense, figs, pepper, pyrethrum, _ana_ four parts; mustard seed, eight\r\nparts; or even a more complicated remedy made with pyrethrum, pepper,\r\nand elaterium,[121] _ana_ one part; scissile alum,[122] poppy, taminia\r\ngrape, crude sulphur, bitumen, laurel berries, mustard seed, _ana_ two\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n“If, says Celsus, the pain renders necessary the removal of the tooth,\r\nthis may be made to fall to pieces, by introducing into the cavity a\r\npepper berry without its skin, or a berry of ivy, pared in the same\r\nway. The same result may be obtained in the following manner: The sharp\r\nbone (aculeus) of that flat fish called by the Greeks trygon and by us\r\npastinaca, must first be roasted and then reduced to powder and mixed\r\nwith resin, so as to form a paste; which applied around the tooth will\r\nmake it fall out. Likewise, scissile alum induces the fall of the\r\ntooth, when introduced into its hollow. This substance, however, is\r\nbest introduced into the small cavity, after being wrapped around with\r\na tuft of wool, for thus the pain is soothed and the tooth preserved.”\r\n\r\nSomewhat curious is the following passage, in which Celsus speaks of\r\nthe superiority of a method of cure used by peasants, compared to the\r\nremedies advised by the doctors. From his words we clearly see that he,\r\nas we have already remarked, did not belong to the class of doctors\r\nproperly so called.\r\n\r\n“These are the remedies accepted and held in account among the doctors.\r\nBut it is known through the experience of peasants, that when a tooth\r\naches one must pluck up wild mint by the roots, put it into a large\r\nvessel, pour water on it, and make the patient sit near it, covered all\r\naround with a blanket; and red hot stones should then be thrown into\r\nthe water, so that they be entirely immersed; and then the patient,\r\nwrapped all around, as we have said before, and keeping his mouth open,\r\nreceives into it the steam evaporated from the water. Thus profuse\r\nperspiration is induced, and a great quantity of pituita flows from the\r\nmouth, and with this a cure is obtained for a very long period, often\r\nfor more than a year.”\r\n\r\nIn the six following chapters of the sixth book, Celsus treats of the\r\ndiseases which affect the soft parts of the mouth. Against tonsillitis,\r\nhe recommends, among other things, the application of a remedy\r\nprincipally made of the juice of the sweet pomegranate, cooked, by a\r\nslow fire, to the consistency of honey. The same remedy is also of\r\ngreat value, according to the author, for the cure of ulcers of the\r\nmouth, when they are accompanied by inflammation, and are somewhat\r\nfoul and of a reddish color. But under such circumstances it will also\r\nbe necessary to keep frequently in the mouth an astringent decoction,\r\nto which a little honey has been added. The exercise of walking is\r\nalso profitable, as well as the taking of food that is not acid. When,\r\nhowever, the ulcers begin to be clean, the mouth should be frequently\r\nfilled with a softening liquid or even with simple pure water. It is\r\nalso helpful to drink genuine wine and to eat rather freely, avoiding,\r\nhowever, acid food. The ulcers must be sprinkled with a powder composed\r\nof two parts of scissile alum to three of unripe gall-nuts. If,\r\nhowever, the ulcers are already covered with a scab similar to those\r\nproduced on burns, some of those compositions should be used which are\r\ncalled by the Greeks _antheræ_; for example, a remedy may be formed\r\nof equal parts of cyperus,[123] myrrh, sandarac, and alum; or another\r\nwhich contains saffron, myrrh, _ana_ two parts; iris, scissile alum,\r\nsandarac, _ana_ four parts; cyperus, eight parts.\r\n\r\n“Much more dangerous, says Celsus, are those ulcers of the mouth which\r\nthe Greeks call _aphthæ_; they oftentimes lead to death in children;\r\nin adult men and women, however, there is not the same danger. These\r\nulcers begin in the gums; then they attack the palate and the whole\r\nof the mouth, and finally extend to the uvula and to the fauces; when\r\nthese parts are attacked, it is not very likely that a child will\r\nrecover.”\r\n\r\nAs to the ulcers of the tongue, Celsus says that those which are\r\nsituated at the borders of this organ last a very long time, and he\r\nadds: “It should be seen whether there may not be some sharp tooth\r\nopposite, which hinders the ulcer from healing; in case such a tooth\r\nexists, it should have its edge taken off with a file.”\r\n\r\nHe then passes on to speak of the diseases of the gums: “Often small\r\npainful tumors, called by the Greeks _parulides_, are produced on\r\nthe gums. It is necessary at the very first to rub them softly with\r\npowdered salt, or with a mixture of burnt mineral salt, cyperus, and\r\ncatmint, meanwhile keeping the mouth open until there flows from it a\r\ngood quantity of pituita; after which the mouth must be rinsed with\r\na decoction of lentils. But if the inflammation is great, the same\r\nremedies must be used as are adopted for the ulcers in the mouth, and\r\nbetween the tooth and the gum must be inserted a small tent of soft\r\nlint, on which has been smeared some one of those compositions which\r\nwe have said are called _antheræ_. If this, owing to the hardness of\r\nthe tumor, is not possible, then by means of a sponge the steam of hot\r\nwater should be made to act upon the diseased part, and, besides, an\r\nemollient cerate must be applied upon it.\r\n\r\n“Should suppuration show itself, it will be necessary to use the\r\nabove-mentioned steam for a longer period; to keep in the mouth hot\r\nmulse, in which some figs have been cooked, and to lance the tumor\r\nbefore it is perfectly ripe, so that the pus may not, by remaining too\r\nlong in the diseased part, injure the bone. But if the tumor be of\r\ngreat size, it will be more advisable to remove it entirely, so that\r\nthe tooth remain free on both sides. After the pus has been extracted,\r\nif the wound be a small one, it is sufficient to keep hot water in the\r\nmouth, and to use externally fomentations of steam, as mentioned above;\r\nif it be large, it will be fitting to use the decoction of lentils and\r\nthe same remedies with which all other ulcers of the mouth are cured.\r\n\r\n“It also happens, sometimes, that from an ulcer of the gums—whether it\r\nfollow a parulis or not—one may have for a long period a discharge of\r\npus, on account of a broken or rotten tooth, or else on account of a\r\ndisease of the bone; in this case there very often exists a fistula.\r\nThen the latter must be opened, the tooth extracted, and if any bony\r\nfragment exist, this should be removed; and if there be anything else\r\ndiseased, this should be scraped away. Afterward, the same remedies\r\nwhich have been indicated for the other ulcers of the mouth must be\r\nused.\r\n\r\n“If the gums separate from the teeth, it will be useful, in this\r\ncase also, to employ those remedies called _antheræ_. But it is also\r\nbeneficial to chew unripe pears and apples and to keep their juices in\r\nthe mouth. Equal advantage can be derived from keeping vinegar in the\r\nmouth, provided it be not too strong.\r\n\r\n“Whenever ulcers of the mouth are attacked by gangrene, it is necessary\r\nfirst to consider whether the whole body be unhealthy, and in that\r\ncase, to do what is necessary to strengthen it. When the gangrenous\r\nulcer is superficial, the use of _antheræ_ is sufficient; when it is\r\nsomewhat deeper, a mixture must be applied on it, of two parts of\r\nburnt paper[124] to one of orpiment;[125] when it is very deep, three\r\nparts of burnt paper to a fourth part of orpiment must be used; or\r\nelse, equal parts of roasted salt and roasted iris; or lastly, equal\r\nparts of chalcites, lime, and orpiment. It is, however, necessary to\r\ndip a small pledget of lint in oil of roses, and put it on the caustic\r\nmedicinals, so that these may not injure the neighboring healthy parts.\r\nIf the disease is in the gums, and some of the teeth are loose, it is\r\nnecessary to pull them out, for they greatly hinder the cure. When\r\nthis latter, however, cannot be obtained by drugs, the ulcer must be\r\ncauterized with a red-hot iron.”\r\n\r\nChapter XII of the seventh book is, of all the work of Celsus, the\r\none which presents to us the greatest interest, since there the author\r\ntreats of the surgical operations required by the diseases of the\r\ndental apparatus.\r\n\r\nHe first speaks of the looseness of the teeth, caused by the weakness\r\nof their roots, or by the flaccidity of the gums, and says that in\r\nthese cases it is necessary to touch the gums lightly with a red-hot\r\niron, then to smear them with honey and wash them with mulse, and later\r\non to strengthen them by means of astringent substances.\r\n\r\n“When a tooth aches, and it is thought well to extract it, because\r\nmedicaments are of no use, the gum must be detached all around, and\r\nthen the tooth must be shaken until it is well loosened, it being very\r\ndangerous to draw a firm tooth, as this may sometimes give rise to a\r\ndislocation of the lower jaw. And greater still is the danger in regard\r\nto the upper teeth, as this might cause a shock to the temples and\r\neyes. After having well loosened the tooth, it must be pulled out by\r\nthe fingers, if this is possible; or if not, with the forceps.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27\r\n\r\nDental and surgical instruments represented in a funeral marble of the\r\nLateran Museum, Rome.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that this method of tooth drawing—so excessively cautious\r\nand timid—must have been very torturing to the poor patients. A\r\nthousand years and more after Celsus, Abulcasis still counsels the same\r\nexaggerated precautions, and says that the extraction of a tooth must\r\nnot be performed in a rapid and violent way after the manner of the\r\nbarbers. From this one may see that the operation spoken of was then\r\nvery often performed by certain unprofessional persons, who, being very\r\nfamiliar with it, carried it out with great indifference and rapidity,\r\nthus sparing the patients the long-protracted martyrdom which the\r\nerudite doctors, followers of Celsus, thought necessary to make them\r\nendure. Very probably the same happened in the days of the wise Roman\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\nWhen there is a large carious hollow in the tooth to be extracted,\r\nCelsus recommends that it should first be filled up either with lint\r\nor with lead, in order to prevent the tooth from breaking under the\r\npressure of the instrument. “The latter,” he continues, “must be made\r\nto act in a straight direction, in order to avoid fracture of the bone.\r\nThe danger of fracture is still greater in the case of short teeth;\r\noften the forceps, not being able to grasp the tooth well, takes hold\r\nof the bone with it and fractures the latter. When after the extraction\r\nof a tooth much blood flows from the wound, this indicates that some\r\npart of the bone has been broken. It is necessary then to search for\r\nthe detached piece of bone with the probe and to extract it with the\r\nforceps. If this be not successful, an incision must be made in the\r\ngums just as large as is necessary for the extraction of the fragment.\r\nWhen this is not taken out, it often happens that the jaw swells in\r\nsuch a manner as to prevent the patient from opening his mouth. In such\r\na case it is necessary to apply to the cheek a hot cataplasm of flour\r\nand figs, so as to induce suppuration, after which the gums must be\r\nlanced and the splinter of bone extracted.”\r\n\r\nWhen the teeth show blackish stains, Celsus advises such stains to\r\nbe scraped away, and the teeth afterward to be rubbed with a mixture\r\nof pounded rose leaves, gall-nuts, and myrrh, and the mouth to be\r\nfrequently washed with pure wine. It is necessary besides, says the\r\nauthor, to keep the head well covered, to walk a great deal, and to\r\npartake of no acid food.\r\n\r\n“If by effect of a blow or other accident some of the teeth become\r\nloose, it is necessary to bind them with gold wire to the neighboring\r\nfirm teeth, and besides to keep in the mouth astringent substances, for\r\nexample, wine in which the rind of pomegranates has been boiled, or\r\ninto which some burning hot gall-nuts have been thrown.”\r\n\r\n“When in a child a permanent tooth appears before the fall of the milk\r\ntooth, it is necessary to dissect the gum all around the latter and\r\nextract it; the other tooth must then be pushed with the finger, day by\r\nday, toward the place that was occupied by the one extracted; and this\r\nis to be done until it has firmly reached its right position.”\r\n\r\n“Now and again it happens that when a tooth is pulled out its root\r\nremains in the socket; it is then necessary to extract it at once, with\r\nthe forceps adapted for the purpose, called by the Greeks _rizagra_.”\r\n\r\nThe last book of the work of Celsus treats chiefly of fractures and\r\ndislocations. In the first chapter the position and form of the bones\r\nof the whole human body are described, although not very exactly.\r\nSpeaking of the teeth, the author says: “The teeth are harder than the\r\nbones, and are fixed, some on the _maxilla_ (lower jaw) and some on the\r\noverhanging bone of the cheeks.”[126]\r\n\r\n“The first four teeth, being cutting teeth (incisors), are called by\r\nthe Greeks _tomici_. These are flanked on both sides by one canine.\r\nBeyond this there ordinarily exist, on both sides, five grinders,\r\nexcept in the case of those persons in whom the last molars, which\r\ncommonly are cut very late, have not yet appeared. The incisors and\r\nthe canines are fixed with one single root; but the molars at least\r\nwith two, some even with three or four. In general, the shorter the\r\ntooth, so much the longer is its root. A straight tooth commonly has a\r\nstraight root, a curved tooth has it generally curved. The root of a\r\ntemporary tooth produces in children a new tooth, which usually pushes\r\nout the first; sometimes, however, the new tooth appears either above\r\nor below it.”\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter Celsus treats of fractures in general, but in\r\nparticular of those of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\n“To reduce a fracture of this bone, it should be pressed in a proper\r\nmanner, from the inside of the mouth and from the outside, with the\r\nforefinger and thumb of both hands. Then in the case of a transverse\r\nfracture (in which case generally an unevenness in the level of the\r\nteeth is produced), it is necessary, after having set the fragments\r\nin place, to tie together the two teeth nearest to the fracture with\r\na silk thread, or else, if these are loose, the following ones. After\r\nthis, one should apply externally, on the part corresponding to the\r\nlesion, a thick compress, dipped in wine and oil and sprinkled with\r\nflour and powdered olibanum. This compress is to be fixed by a bandage\r\nor by a strip of soft leather, with a longitudinal slit in the middle\r\nto embrace the chin, the two ends being tied together above the head.\r\nThe patient must fast the first two days; then he may be nourished with\r\nliquid food, but in small quantities, abstaining, however, completely\r\nfrom wine. On the third day it is necessary to take off the apparatus,\r\nand after having fomented the part with the steam of hot water, to\r\nreplace it. The same is to be done on the fifth day, and so on, until\r\nthe inflammation has subsided, which generally happens from the seventh\r\nto the ninth day. After the symptoms of inflammation have vanished, the\r\npatient may take abundant nourishment; he must, however, abstain from\r\nchewing until the fracture is completely consolidated; and, therefore,\r\nhe will continue to nourish himself with soups and like food. He must\r\nalso entirely abstain from speaking, especially during the first few\r\ndays. Fractures of the jaw commonly heal from the fourteenth to the\r\ntwenty-first day.\r\n\r\n“In luxations of the jaw (Chapter XII) the bone is always displaced\r\nforward; but sometimes only on one side, and sometimes on both sides.\r\nWhen the dislocation is only on one side, the chin and the whole jaw\r\nare found deviated toward the part opposite to the luxation; and\r\nthe similar teeth of the two dental arches do not correspond; but\r\ninstead under the upper incisors will be found the canine tooth of\r\nthe dislocated part. If, however, the luxation is bilateral, the\r\nchin inclines and projects forward; the lower teeth are farther in\r\nfront than the upper ones, and the muscles of the temples are tightly\r\nstretched. The reduction of the luxation must be performed as quickly\r\nas possible. The patient having been made to sit down, an assistant\r\nholds the head firmly from behind; or else the patient is made to sit\r\nwith his shoulders against a wall, with a hard cushion between this and\r\nhis head, whilst the assistant holds the head against the cushion, and\r\nso keeps it steady. Then the operator, after wrapping his two thumbs in\r\nlinen cloth or strips, that they may not slip, introduces them into the\r\npatient’s mouth and, applying the other fingers on the outside, firmly\r\ngrasps the jaw. Then whilst lowering the back part of the latter, he\r\nshakes the chin and pushes it upward and backward, seeking to shut the\r\nmouth, and in this way making the jaw return to its natural position.\r\n\r\n“The bone having been replaced, if the accident should have given rise\r\nto pains in the eyes and neck, it will be well to draw blood from the\r\narm. After the luxation has been reduced, the patient must be nourished\r\nfor some time on liquid food, and abstain, as much as possible, from\r\nspeaking.”\r\n\r\nCAIUS PLINIUS SECUNDUS. After Celsus, a very celebrated writer on\r\nmedicine and natural science was Caius Plinius Secundus. He was born\r\nat Como in the year 23 of the Christian era, and flourished from the\r\ndays of Nero to those of Vespasian. Endowed with a liberal education,\r\nhe gave himself up to public life, filling many important posts, among\r\nwhich, that of Governor of Spain under Nero and his successors. In\r\nthe year 79 after Christ, while he was in command of the Roman fleet\r\nat Misenum, the tremendous eruption of Vesuvius took place, by which\r\nPompeii, Herculaneum, and other neighboring cities were destroyed.\r\nPliny, driven by the desire to study that marvellous and awful natural\r\nphenomenon, betook himself to Stabia, but was there suffocated by the\r\nashes and smoke erupted by Vesuvius.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the many places occupied by him, Pliny found time to\r\nwrite many works, and among these the thirty-seven books on _Natural\r\nHistory_, which have given him eternal fame.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all to be wondered at that this immense work contains a\r\ngreat number of fables, superstitions, and errors of every kind. To\r\nsift the true from the false was not an easy thing, at a time when\r\nthere was almost no idea as to how natural phenomena were produced,\r\nand when all scientific criticism was impossible, for the very simple\r\nreason that true science did not exist.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the great absurdities which were believed in at that\r\nepoch, and which were considered possible even by higher intellects\r\nsuch as Pliny’s, the following passages will suffice: “In many\r\nmountains of India, according to what Ctesia writes, there are men\r\nwith dogs’ heads, who clothe themselves with the skins of wild beasts\r\nand bark instead of speaking. There are also a kind of men having only\r\none leg, and who have great speed in leaping. Others are without any\r\nneck and have their eyes between their shoulders. Megasthenes writes\r\nthat among the nomad Indians are men who instead of a nose have only\r\nholes, and have their legs bent like serpents. At the extreme confines\r\nof India, toward the East, are men without any mouth and with their\r\nbodies entirely covered with hair, who live on nothing but air and\r\nodors, which they inhale through the nose.”[127]\r\n\r\nIn Pliny’s day the most prodigious virtues were attributed to herbs; in\r\nregard to this the following example is sufficient:\r\n\r\n“The herb near which dogs may have made water, when gathered, but\r\nwithout being touched by iron, cures luxations very promptly.”[128]\r\n\r\nIt must not be thought that Pliny accepted such beliefs without\r\nreserve. He notes them, because preceding authors had accepted them,\r\nand because if certain things appear to us evidently absurd, their\r\nabsurdity could not be equally evident at a period when little more\r\nthan nothing was known in regard to physical and physiological laws,\r\nand when the impossibility of rationally explaining natural effects\r\nled men to admit the existence of marvellous virtues and influences in\r\nevery being and in all bodies. On the other hand, Pliny expressly says,\r\nfor his own justification, in Chapter I of Book VII: “I do not want to\r\nbind my faith in many things which I am about to say; but rather refer\r\nthe readers to the authors from whom I have taken them.”\r\n\r\nAs is to be expected, we find in Pliny’s works, in regard to teeth, a\r\nstrange mixture of truth and errors.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XV of Book VII, after having said that some children are\r\nborn with teeth, and after having cited, as examples, Manius Curius,\r\nwho was therefore called Dentatus, and Gnæus Papirius Carbo, both\r\nillustrious men, he adds:\r\n\r\n“In women such a thing was considered a bad augury in the days of the\r\nkings. In fact, Valeria having been born with teeth, the seers said\r\nthat she would be the ruin of the city to which she would be taken; she\r\nwas sent to Suessa Pometia, which in those days was a very flourishing\r\ncity; and, in fact, the prediction was verified. Some, instead of\r\nteeth, have an entire bone; of this there was an example in the son of\r\nPrusias, King of Bithynia, who instead of upper teeth had one single\r\nbone.”\r\n\r\n“The teeth alone are not consumed by fire, and do not burn with the\r\nrest of the body. And yet these teeth, which withstand the flames,\r\nare worn away and hollowed out by pituita. They wear out by being\r\nused. Nor are they necessary for mastication alone, for the foremost\r\nones regulate the voice and words, producing by the beat of the tongue\r\nspecial sounds.”\r\n\r\n“Men have thirty-two teeth, women a lesser number. It is, however,\r\nbelieved that augury may be taken from the teeth; and to have a greater\r\nnumber than usual is considered an indication of long life. The\r\npresence of two eye teeth at the right side of the upper jaw presages\r\nfavorable fortune, as was verified in Agrippina, the mother of Domitius\r\nNero; on the left side, however, they are of sad foreboding.”\r\n\r\n“The last teeth, which are called the genuine teeth, appear toward the\r\ntwentieth year of age; many persons, however, do not have them until\r\ntheir eightieth year. Teeth fall out in old age and then spring up\r\nagain; of this there can be no doubt. Mutianus writes of having known\r\na certain Zancle of Samothracia, in whom teeth reappeared after he had\r\ncompleted his one hundred and fourth year. Timarcus, son of Nicocles of\r\nPaphus, had two rows of molar teeth, whilst a brother of his did not\r\nchange his incisor teeth at all, which, therefore, wore down little\r\nby little. There once lived a man who had a tooth in his palate. The\r\ncanine teeth, when by any chance they fall out, do not reappear any\r\nmore.”[129]\r\n\r\n“In the teeth of man there exists a poisonous substance which has the\r\neffect of dimming the brightness of a looking-glass when they are\r\npresented uncovered before it; and if they are uncovered in front of\r\nyoung unfledged pigeons, these take ill and die.”[130]\r\n\r\nThe second of these two statements is but a prejudice, like many\r\nothers; but we find the first very strange indeed, it being a\r\nsurprising thing that a man like Pliny should have attributed to\r\nan imaginary poison of the teeth what is the simple effect of the\r\nmoistures of the breath.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters CXV and CXVII of Book XI are found some observations which\r\nare somewhat interesting to us:\r\n\r\n“A man’s breath becomes infected by the bad quality of food, by the bad\r\nstate of the teeth, and still more by old age.”\r\n\r\n“Simple food is very beneficial to man; the variety of flavors\r\ninstead is very harmful. Sour or too abundant foods are digested with\r\ndifficulty, and also those which are ravenously swallowed. As a remedy,\r\nvomiting has come into use; but it makes the body cold and is most\r\npernicious to the eyes and to the teeth.”\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the habit of often provoking vomitus—which,\r\nin those times of excessive corruption and intemperance, had come\r\ninto general use—must have resulted in enormous harm to the teeth,\r\nespecially by the action exercised upon them by the hydrochloric\r\nacid contained in the gastric juice, and by the organic acids of\r\nfermentation.\r\n\r\nAmong the vegetable remedies in those times considered of use against\r\nodontalgia, the principal ones are mentioned in Chapter CV of Book XXV:\r\n\r\n“It is beneficial against toothache to chew the root of panax, and\r\nlikewise to wash the teeth with its juice. It is also useful to\r\nchew the root of hyoscyamus soaked in vinegar, or else that of the\r\npolemonium. It is also beneficial to chew the roots of the plantain, or\r\nto wash the teeth in a decoction of plantain in vinegar. A decoction of\r\nthe leaves is also useful, not only in the case of simple toothache,\r\nbut also when the gums are tender and easily bleed. The seed of\r\nthe same plant cures inflammations and abscesses of the gums. The\r\naristolochia strengthens the gums and the teeth. The same effect may be\r\nproduced by masticating the verbena with its root, or by washing the\r\nmouth with a decoction of it in wine or vinegar. Similarly the roots\r\nof the cinquefoil are helpful when boiled down to a third, in wine or\r\nvinegar; however, they must first be washed in salt water or brine. The\r\ndecoction must be kept for a long time in the mouth.\r\n\r\n“Instead of using the decoction of cinquefoil, some prefer to rub the\r\nloose teeth with the ashes of this plant. Besides the above-mentioned\r\nremedies, the root of the verbascum boiled in wine, hyssop, and the\r\njuice of the peucedanum with opium are also employed; and it is also\r\nbeneficial to pour into the nostrils, on the side opposite to that of\r\nthe sick tooth, some drops of the juice of anagallis.\r\n\r\n“It is said that if senecio be taken from the earth, and the aching\r\ntooth be touched three times with it, spitting alternatively three\r\ntimes, and then the herb be replanted in the same spot, so that it may\r\ncontinue to live, the tooth will never give pain any more.”[131]\r\n\r\n“In the fuller’s thistle,[132] an herb which grows near rivers, is\r\nfound a small worm, which has the power of curing dental pains, when\r\nthe said worm is killed by rubbing it on the teeth, or when it is\r\nclosed up with wax in the hollow teeth.”[133]\r\n\r\n“Apollonius writes that a very efficacious remedy for pains in the gums\r\nis to scratch them with the tooth of a man who has suffered a violent\r\ndeath.”[134]\r\n\r\n“It is considered very beneficial for toothache to bite off a piece\r\nfrom wood which has been struck by lightning, and to touch the sick\r\ntooth with it; but whilst biting off the little piece of wood, it is\r\nnecessary to keep both hands behind the back.”[135]\r\n\r\n“Experience teaches that against the bad odor of the breath it is\r\nuseful to wash the mouth with pure wine before sleeping, and that to\r\navoid aching of the teeth, it is a good thing to rinse the mouth, in\r\nthe morning, with several mouthfuls of fresh water, but of an odd\r\nnumber.”[136]\r\n\r\n“A remedy for toothache is to touch the diseased teeth with the\r\ntooth of a hyena,[137] or to scratch the gums with the tooth of a\r\nhippopotamus which has been taken from the left side of the jaw.”[138]\r\n\r\n“The ashes of stag’s horn, rubbed over loose and aching teeth, makes\r\nthem firm and soothes the pain. Some consider that to produce the same\r\neffect, of greater virtue is the powder of the horn, unburnt. Both\r\nthe ashes and the powder of stag’s horn are employed as a dentifrice.\r\nThe ashes of the head of a wolf are a great remedy for toothache.\r\nSuch pains are also made to cease by wearing certain bones that are\r\noftentimes found in the dung of this animal. The ashes of the head of a\r\nhare is a useful dentifrice; and if spikenard be added, it will lessen\r\nthe bad smell of the mouth. Some mix with it the ashes of the heads of\r\nmice. In the side of the hare is a bone as sharp as a needle; and many\r\nadvise pricking the teeth with this when they ache. The heel of the ox\r\nkindled and brought close to loose teeth makes them firm. The ashes of\r\nthis bone mingled with myrrh is a good dentifrice. A good dentifrice\r\nis also made from the ashes of the feet of a goat. To strengthen teeth\r\nloosened by a blow, asses’ milk or the ashes of the teeth of this\r\nanimal are very useful. In the heart of the horse there is a bone like\r\nan eye-tooth; it is said that it is very beneficial to pick with it the\r\nteeth that ache. The carpenter’s glue boiled in water and plastered\r\non to the teeth also takes away their pain; but soon after it must be\r\ntaken away and the mouth rinsed with wine in which have been boiled the\r\nrinds of sweet pomegranates. It is also thought beneficial to wash the\r\nteeth with goat’s milk or with ox-gall.”[139]\r\n\r\n“Butter, either alone or with honey, is very useful for children; and\r\nis very helpful, especially during dentition, in the diseases of the\r\ngums, and to cure the ulcers of the mouth. To prevent the disorders\r\nthat generally accompany dentition, it is a useful thing that the child\r\nshould wear a wolf’s tooth, or one of the first teeth lost by a horse.\r\nThe rubbing of the gums with goat’s milk or with hare’s brain renders\r\nthe cutting of teeth much easier.”[140]\r\n\r\n“To sweeten the breath it is very helpful to rub the teeth and the gums\r\nwith wool and honey.”[141]\r\n\r\n“The filth of the tail of sheep rolled up in little balls, and left to\r\ndry and then reduced to powder and rubbed on the teeth, is marvellously\r\nuseful against the loosening and other diseases of the teeth themselves\r\nand against the cankerous ulcers of the gums.”[142]\r\n\r\n“Eggshells deprived of their internal membrane and afterward burnt\r\nafford a good dentifrice.”[143] (Hence we see that the use of carbonate\r\nof lime as a dentifrice is a very ancient one.)\r\n\r\n“If the head of a dog that has died mad be burnt, the ashes obtained\r\nmay be advantageously used against toothache, mixing it with cyprine\r\noil and then dropping the mixture into the ear, on the side of the\r\npain. It is beneficial also to pick the sick tooth with the longest\r\ntooth, on the left side, of a dog; or with the frontal bones of a\r\nlizard, taken from the head of the animal at full moon, and which\r\nhave not touched the earth. The teeth of a dog, boiled in wine until\r\nthis is reduced to one-half, thus, furnish a mouth wash which can\r\nbe advantageously used against toothache. In the cases of difficult\r\ndentition, benefit is derived by rubbing the gums with the ashes of\r\nthe teeth of a dog, mixed with honey. Such ashes are also used as a\r\ndentifrice. In hollow teeth it is useful to introduce the ashes of\r\nthe dung of mice, or of the dried liver of lizards. It is the opinion\r\nof some, that in order not to be subject to toothache, a mouse should\r\nbe eaten twice a month. If earth-worms be cooked in oil, this latter\r\nhas the virtue of calming toothache when dropped into the ear on the\r\nside of the pain. The same effect is obtained by rubbing the teeth\r\nwith the ashes of the aforesaid worms, after they have been burnt in\r\na terra-cotta vase; and if such ashes be introduced into the hollow\r\nteeth, these fall out very easily. A good remedy against toothache is\r\nto wash the mouth with vinegar of squills in which earth-worms and\r\nthe root of the mulberry have been boiled. The ashes of the shells of\r\nsnails mixed with myrrh, rubbed on the gums, strengthens them. Even\r\nthe slough which the snakes cast off in spring can furnish a remedy\r\nagainst toothache. For this purpose it must be boiled in oil, with\r\nthe addition of resin of the larch, and then the oil dropped into the\r\near. For the same purpose, according to some, oil of roses is useful,\r\nwhen a spider, caught with the left hand, has been pounded in it. If a\r\nsparrow’s fledglings be burnt with dry vine twigs, the resulting ashes\r\nrubbed with vinegar on the teeth makes all pain cease in them.[144] It\r\nis stated by many that to improve the odor of the breath, it is well\r\nto rub the teeth with ashes of mice mixed with honey. Some also mingle\r\nwith this the root of fennel. Picking the teeth with the quill of a\r\nvulture renders the breath sour. It makes the teeth firm to pick them\r\nwith a porcupine’s quill. A decoction of swallows in wine sweetened\r\nwith honey cures ulcers of the tongue and lips. Scaldings in the mouth\r\nproduced by hot food or drinks are readily healed with the milk of a\r\nbitch.”[145]\r\n\r\nThat Pliny did not put great faith in many of the things which he\r\nrelates is clearly proved by several passages of his book, and among\r\nothers by the following:\r\n\r\n“One can hardly relate without laughing, some things, which, however,\r\nI will not omit, because they are found already written. They say\r\nthat the ox has a small stone in the head, which it spits out when\r\nit fears death; but if its head be suddenly cut off, and the stone\r\nextracted, this, worn by a child, helps it in wondrous manner to cut\r\nits teeth.”[146]\r\n\r\nIn Book XXXI, Pliny speaks of various waters—mineral, thermal,\r\netc.—especially from the medical point of view. It was already known\r\nin those days that those waters were most active agents. And in this\r\nrespect a fact which the author relates in Chapter VI of Book XXV is\r\nworth mentioning:\r\n\r\n“When Caesar Germanicus moved his camp beyond the Rhine, there was\r\nfound, in the whole maritime tract of the country, only one spring of\r\nfresh water, the drinking of which, within two years, produced the fall\r\nof teeth and a loosening of the knee-joints. The doctors called these\r\nevils stomacace and scelotyrbe.”\r\n\r\nSea salt and nitre are of use, according to Pliny, against various\r\nmaladies of the teeth and mouth. He counsels the application of salt\r\non lint to the ulcers of the oral cavity, and to rub it on the gums\r\nwhen they are swollen. To prevent diseases of the teeth, it would be\r\nadvantageous, every morning before breaking one’s fast, to keep a\r\nlittle salt under the tongue until it is dissolved. Against the pain\r\nof the teeth it would be beneficial to use common salt dissolved in\r\nvinegar, or nitre in wine.\r\n\r\n“The rubbing of the blackened teeth with burnt nitre gives them back\r\ntheir natural color.”[147]\r\n\r\nThe prophylactic remedies against odontalgia believed in, at that\r\nperiod, were sufficiently numerous, and, among many other such things,\r\nPliny informs us that in order not to be subject to toothache, it is\r\nsufficient to wash the mouth three times a year with the blood of the\r\ntortoise.[148] Analogous virtue was also attributed to the brain of the\r\nshark, which was boiled in oil, and this put by for washing the teeth\r\nwith once a year.\r\n\r\nBesides the many anti-odontalgic remedies so far related, several\r\nothers are found enumerated in Chapter XXVI of Book XXXII:\r\n\r\n“The pain in the teeth is lessened by picking the gums with the bones\r\nof the sea dragon. It is also very beneficial to pick the gums with\r\nthe sharp bone of the puffin.[149] If the same be pounded together\r\nwith white hellebore, and the mixture thus obtained be rubbed on the\r\ndiseased teeth, they may be made to fall out without pain. The ashes,\r\nalso, of salt fish burnt in an earthen vase, with the addition of\r\npowdered marble, is a remedy against toothache. Frogs are also boiled\r\nin a hemina[150] of vinegar, the decoction being then used to wash\r\nthe teeth with; but this, however, must be kept in the mouth for\r\nsome length of time. In order to render this remedy less nauseous,\r\nSallustius Dionisius used to hang several frogs, by their hind feet,\r\nover a vase in which he boiled the vinegar, so that the juices of the\r\nanimals might drip into this from their mouths. To make loose teeth\r\nfirm, some advise the soaking of two frogs, after having cut off\r\ntheir feet, in a hemina of wine, and the washing of the mouth with\r\nthe latter. Others tie them, whole, on the jaws. Some, to strengthen\r\nunsteady teeth, rinse them with a decoction made by boiling ten frogs\r\nin three sextaries[151] of vinegar, until the liquor is reduced to\r\none-third. By others, thirty-six hearts of frogs are well boiled in\r\na sextary of old oil, in a copper vessel, and the oil is then used\r\nagainst toothache, dropping it into the ear, on the side of the pain.\r\nSome, after having boiled the liver of a frog, pound it with honey, and\r\nsmear it on the sore teeth. If the teeth are decayed and fetid, many\r\ncounsel the drying of a hundred frogs in an oven, leaving them there\r\nfor one night, then the addition of an equal weight of salt, reducing\r\nthe whole to powder, and rubbing the teeth with it. In such cases the\r\nashes of crabs are also used. That of the murex[152] is adopted as a\r\nsimple dentifrice.”\r\n\r\n“The cutting of teeth is facilitated by rubbing the gums of the child\r\nwith the ashes of dolphin’s teeth mixed with honey, or even simply by\r\ntouching the gums with a tooth of this animal.”[153]\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXXIV of Book XXXVI it is said that the decoction of\r\ngagates[154] in wine cures the diseases of the teeth; and in Chapter\r\nXLII of the same book are praised the dentifrice powders made of pumice\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nFrom the examination of Pliny’s work several important facts come out.\r\n\r\nThe diseases of the teeth were, in those days, most common; very\r\noften we find mention of loose teeth, and the medicines suited to\r\nmake them firm again; from which we may deduce the great frequency\r\nof alveolar pyorrhea. It is reasonable to think that such a fact was\r\ncaused principally by the intemperate life of those times, in which\r\nthe followers of Epicurus were extremely numerous and the unbridled\r\ndesire for pleasure reached such a degree that no abhorrence was felt\r\nof provoking vomit during the course of a long banquet, in order to\r\ncontinue dining merrily.\r\n\r\nConcerning the teeth, their affections, and the means of healing and\r\npreventing them, the strangest superstitions existed, and this not\r\nonly among the common, but also among educated and learned people. The\r\nnumber of remedies reputed useful against diseases of the teeth was\r\nextraordinarily great; but the modern saying, “therapeutic wealth is\r\npoverty,” could have been applied only too well.\r\n\r\nOf the cleanliness of the teeth, it seems, great care was taken, for\r\ndentifrices were in great use. These, as we have already seen, were\r\nmade of the most varied substances—stag’s horn burnt, ashes obtained\r\nby burning the head of the mouse, of the hare, of the wolf, etc.,\r\neggshells burnt and reduced to powder, pumice stone, and so on. For the\r\ncleanliness of the mouth, for strengthening the teeth and gums, mouth\r\nwashes of sundry kinds were likewise adopted, especially formed of\r\ndecoctions of astringent substances in water, wine, and vinegar.\r\n\r\nNot only among the Romans was great care given to the cleanliness and\r\nbeauty of the teeth, but also among many other nations. In this regard\r\nthe following poem of Catullus, in which he lashes the silly vanity of\r\na Celtiberian resident in Rome, who made continual show of his white\r\nteeth, is somewhat interesting:\r\n\r\n  “Egnatius, quod candidos habet dentes\r\n  Renidet usquequaque; seu ad rei ventum est\r\n  Subsellium, cum orator excitat fletum,\r\n  Renidet ille: seu pii ad rogum filii\r\n  Lugetur, orba cum flet unicum mater,\r\n  Renidet ille; quidquid est, ubicumque est,\r\n  Quodcumque agit, renidet: hunc habet morbum,\r\n  Neque elegantem, ut arbitror, neque urbanum.\r\n  Quare monendus es mihi, bone Egnati,\r\n  Si Urbanus esses, aut Sabinus, aut Tiburs,\r\n  Aut parcus Umber, aut obesus Hetruscus,\r\n  Aut Lanuvinus ater, atque dentatus,\r\n  Aut Transpadanus, ut meos quoque attingam,\r\n  Aut quilibet, qui puriter lavit dentes:\r\n  Tamen renidere usquequaque te nollem;\r\n  Nam risu inepto res ineptior nulla est.\r\n  Nunc, Celtiber, in celtiberia terra\r\n  Quod quisque minxit, hoc solet sibi mane\r\n  Dentem, atque russam defricare gingivam.\r\n  Ut quo iste vester expolitior dens est,\r\n  Hoc te amplius bibisse prædicet lotii.”[155]\r\n\r\nSTRABO. From Strabo we learn that the Cantabri and other peoples of\r\nSpain used to clean their teeth and sometimes even to wash their face\r\nnot with fresh, but with old urine, which, so it seems, was kept for\r\nthe purpose, in suitable cisterns![156]\r\n\r\nIn regard to this filthy custom, Joseph Linderer says[157] that the\r\nsuperstition has reached even to our times, although not widely\r\ndiffused, that, to beautify the face, it is useful to wash it with\r\nurine. He relates that he knew a girl who, to become beautiful, had\r\nrecourse to this heroic method, but, unfortunately, without at all\r\nobtaining the desired end!\r\n\r\nMARTIAL. In the epigrams of Martial (about 40 to 101 A.D.) allusions of\r\ngreat value with regard to several points concerning the subject we are\r\ntreating of are found.\r\n\r\nToothpicks (_dentiscalpia_) are mentioned by this poet several\r\ntimes; from which we may argue that they were in great use. They\r\nwere ordinarily made of lentisk wood (_Pistacia lentiscus_), as may\r\nbe deduced from the Epigram LXXIV of Book VI, in which the author\r\nridicules the old dandy who, stretched at length on the triclinium,\r\ncleans with _lentiski_ the toothless mouth, to give himself the air\r\nof a man not too far stricken in years.[158] Besides, in Book XIV,\r\ncontaining, for the greater part, saws and sayings on objects of common\r\nuse, there is an epigram bearing the title of “Dentiscalpium,” in which\r\nthe author says that toothpicks of lentisk are to be preferred, but\r\nthat, in their absence, quill toothpicks may be used.[159]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28\r\n\r\nAn ancient toothpick and ear-picker of gold, found in Crimea.]\r\n\r\nFrom other sources we learn that in those days metal toothpicks\r\nwere also made use of. So in a satire of Petronius, it is said that\r\nTrimalchiones made use of a silver toothpick (_spina argentea_).\r\nObjects of this kind, both Roman and of other origin, are even now in\r\nexistence, and may be found in various collections of antiquities. In\r\nCrimea a most elegant gold object, of Greek make, was found, which is,\r\nby its two ends, both a toothpick and an ear-picker. It belongs most\r\nprobably to the fourth century before Christ.[160]\r\n\r\nIn an object found in the north of Switzerland, and coming from a\r\nRoman military colony of the times of the Empire, the toothpick and\r\near-picker are joined at one of their ends, by a pivot, to other toilet\r\narticles.[161]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29\r\n\r\nA metal toothpick and ear-picker joined to other toilet articles. An\r\nobject found in Switzerland, in the ancient seat of a Roman military\r\ncolony.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30\r\n\r\nAn ancient toothpick and ear-picker of bronze, found in the north of\r\nFrance, at Bavai (the ancient Bagacum).]\r\n\r\nCaylus, in his valuable work _Recueil d’antiquités égyptiennes,\r\nétrusques, grecques, romaines et gauloises_ (Paris, 1752 to 1767),\r\ngives the picture of a toothpick and ear-picker of bronze, two inches\r\nlong, with the middle part wrought in spiral form, so as to increase\r\nthe solidity of the article, and also to enable the hand to keep it\r\neasily firm in all positions. It was found in the north of France, at\r\nBavai (the ancient Bagacum), and forms part of the collection of M.\r\nMignon of Douai.[162]\r\n\r\nMartial is one of the first Roman writers who speak clearly of\r\nartificial teeth. In Epigram LVI of Book XIV, the poet, by a bold\r\npersonification, makes the dentifrice powder say to a toothless old\r\nwoman, furnished with false teeth: “What have you got to do with me?\r\nLet a girl use me. I am not accustomed to clean bought teeth.”[163]\r\n\r\nElsewhere[164] Martial atrociously derides a courtesan, who, among her\r\nother physical defects, was also without an eye: “Without any shame\r\nthou usest purchased locks of hair and teeth. Whatever will you do for\r\nthe eye, Laelia? These are not to be bought!”[165]\r\n\r\nThis epigram shows that, while dental prosthesis was already in use,\r\nocular prosthesis did not as yet exist.\r\n\r\nTo a plagiarist, who passed off Martial’s poetry as his own, the latter\r\nsays: “With our verses, O Fidentinus, dost thou think thyself and\r\ndesire to be thought a poet. Even so, it seems to Ægle that she has all\r\nher teeth, because of her false teeth of bone and ivory.”[166]\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, not the least doubt that in the days of Martial\r\nartificial teeth were in use; and that these, as may be seen from\r\nthe epigram just now quoted, were made of ivory and bone; we do not\r\nknow whether they were formed also of other substances. The question,\r\nhowever, arises: In those times did they manufacture movable artificial\r\nsets, or was the dental art then limited to fixing the artificial teeth\r\nunmovably to the neighboring firm teeth, by means of silk threads, gold\r\nwire, and the like? The answer to this question may be found in another\r\nepigram of Martial,[167] where the latter ridicules a wanton old woman,\r\ntelling her, among other things still worse, that she at night lays\r\ndown her teeth just as she does the silken robes.[168]\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, beyond all doubt that, at that period, the manner of\r\nconstructing movable artificial sets was known; and most probably not\r\nonly partial pieces were made, but even full sets. In fact, from the\r\nverse quoted above we have justly the impression that the poet means a\r\nwhole set rather than a few teeth.\r\n\r\nFrom the words of Martial, it may also be concluded that these dentures\r\ncould be put on and off with the greatest ease; or, as we may say, by\r\na maneuver as simple as that of removing any articles of apparel; they\r\nmust, therefore, have been extremely well constructed.\r\n\r\nThis alone should be sufficient, even were further proof wanting,\r\nto give us an idea of the degree of development and of the point of\r\nperfection reached by dental prosthesis at that time. But besides this,\r\nwe now also possess an ancient Roman piece furnishing a palpable proof\r\nof the ability and ingenuity of the dentists of that epoch. Some few\r\nyears since, I had occasion, in the pursuit of dental archæological\r\nresearch, to visit the Museum of Pope Julius in Rome, where I was shown\r\na prosthetic piece, not yet exhibited to the general public, that had\r\nbeen discovered a few months previous in excavating at Satricum, near\r\nRome. I was invited to give an opinion as to this appliance, and, after\r\nhaving examined it accurately, became aware, not without some emotion,\r\nI am fain to confess, that I held in my hands a prosthetic piece of\r\nexceptional historical importance, that is, no less than a specimen of\r\nancient _crown work_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31\r\n\r\nRoman appliance found at Satricum; crown of lower incisor made of gold.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32\r\n\r\nThe same, seen from below.]\r\n\r\nThe appliance found at Satricum (Fig. 31) is made in the following\r\nmanner: Two small plates of gold, stamped out, represent respectively\r\nthe lingual and labial superficies of a middle lower incisor; these\r\ntwo pieces soldered together form the crown of the tooth. At its base\r\nthe crown is soldered, back and front, to a narrow strip of gold which\r\nfolds back on itself at each end, so as to tightly encircle the two\r\nneighboring teeth on the right and on the left, which thus serve as\r\nsupports to the appliance.\r\n\r\nWe are now, therefore, able not only to affirm that the Etruscans knew\r\nhow to execute a kind of _bridge work_, but that later the dentists of\r\nancient Rome even carried out _crown work_.\r\n\r\nThis, notwithstanding the examples of dental prosthesis discovered\r\nup to now in Roman and Etruscan tombs, can in no way be considered\r\nas representing all the varieties of dental prosthesis of ancient\r\nconstruction. It is to be hoped that, in spite of the destructive\r\naction of time, in continuing the excavations and archæological\r\nresearches, many other specimens of early dental prosthesis will yet\r\ncome to light. In any case, judging by some indications to be found\r\nin Latin literature, it must be admitted that the Roman dentists of\r\nantiquity constructed other kinds of prosthesis besides the specimens\r\nwe possess, and in particular movable dentures. We are led to suppose\r\nthis, not only from the above cited epigram of Martial, but also from\r\nwhat we read in one of the satires of Horace, who dates contemporarily\r\nwith Augustus, and therefore anteriorly to Martial. Speaking of two\r\nold witches who had been put to flight by Priapus, Horace writes: “You\r\nwould have laughed to see those two old witches run toward the town,\r\nlosing in their flight, Canidia, her false teeth, Sagania, her false\r\nhair.”[169]\r\n\r\nNow, as Prof. Deneffe very rightly observes, the prosthetic appliances\r\nof antiquity known to us are so firmly fixed to the natural teeth\r\nthat no race, however unbridled, could ever have made them fall out\r\nof the mouth. It must, therefore, be admitted, as I have said, that\r\nthe ancients constructed other kinds of dental appliances, of which no\r\nspecimens have, as yet, been discovered.\r\n\r\nNeither in Celsus nor in Pliny, nor in any other Roman writers on\r\nmedicine, do we find any allusion to the art of dentistry. The doctors\r\nof those days probably had no idea of the advantages which could be\r\nderived from dental prosthesis in regard to digestion and consequently\r\nto the health of the whole body. They therefore must have considered\r\nartificial teeth as something totally foreign to their art, and\r\nintended solely to hide a physical defect. It is therefore not at all\r\nsurprising that they have not treated of this subject.\r\n\r\nAs the art of setting artificial teeth was exercised by persons not\r\nbelonging to the medical profession, it is very probable that these\r\npersons also undertook the extraction of teeth and the cure of dental\r\npains. Martial (Book X, Epigram LVI) names a certain Cascellius, who,\r\nhe says, “extracts or cures diseased teeth,”[170] and this is the first\r\ndentist whose name has been sent down to us. In spite of this, nothing\r\npermits us to affirm that there existed at that time a class of real\r\ndentists, viz., of persons dedicated to the exclusive cure of dental\r\ndisease. There are strong reasons for doubting this, especially when\r\nwe consider that the Latin language has no word corresponding to the\r\nword dentist. If there had existed a true dental profession, there\r\nought also to have existed a name for indicating the individuals who\r\nexercised it. Therefore, it must be considered highly probable that,\r\nalthough there undoubtedly existed individuals who were especially\r\nskilled in the cure of the diseases of the teeth, such persons did\r\nnot form a special class; perhaps, among those to whom recourse was\r\nhad for the cure of dental diseases, some were doctors, particularly\r\nskilled in such diseases, others were perhaps barbers, and so forth.\r\nAs to the far-fetched deductions of Geist-Jacobi, according to whom the\r\nname given to dentists by the Romans must have been that of _artifex\r\ndentium_ or _artifex medicus dentium_, these are founded, above all, on\r\nimagination. It is extremely improbable that such names existed, when\r\none considers that they are not met with, even once, in the whole range\r\nof Latin literature.\r\n\r\nSCRIBONIUS LARGUS. Among the writers on Medicine in the early period of\r\nthe Empire, one of the most eminent was, without any doubt, Scribonius\r\nLargus, physician to the Emperor Claudius, whom he accompanied to\r\nEngland in the year 43.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus, in his book _De compositione medicamentorum_,\r\npronounces himself energetically against the division of Medicine into\r\nsingle special branches. He declaims against the many who attributed\r\nto themselves the name of doctors, simply because they knew how to\r\ncure some diseases. According to him, the true doctor must be skilled\r\nin curing all kinds of affections. This, in truth, was possible in\r\nthose times, but would be almost impossible nowadays, on account of the\r\nenormous development of the healing art. The ideas, however, expressed\r\nby Scribonius Largus have a certain historical importance, for they\r\nshow that in his times the medical art had certainly the tendency to\r\nsplit up into many special branches, among which there must certainly\r\nhave been dentistry, but that the necessity of such separation was not\r\nby any means universally recognized; the great doctors of those days\r\nundertook the cure of the diseases of the teeth, as well as those of\r\nany other part of the body.\r\n\r\nThe tenth chapter of the book of Scribonius Largus treats of the cure\r\nof odontalgia. The author begins by saying that it is the opinion of\r\nmany that the only true remedy against toothache is the forceps. With\r\nall this, he adds, there are many medicaments, from which great benefit\r\nmay be derived against these pains, without it always being necessary\r\nto have recourse to extraction. Even when a tooth is affected with\r\ncaries, says the author, it is not always advisable to extract it; but\r\nit is much better, in many cases, to cut away the diseased part with a\r\nscalpel adapted for the purpose.\r\n\r\n“Violent toothache may be calmed in various ways, viz., with mouth\r\nwashes, masticatories, fumigations, or by the direct application of\r\nfitting medicaments. It is beneficial to rinse the mouth frequently\r\nwith a decoction of parietaria or of cypress berries, or to apply to\r\nthe tooth the root or the seeds of the hyoscyamus wrapped up in a\r\ncloth, and dipped from time to time in boiling water, or to chew the\r\nportulaca (purslane), or to keep for some time its juice in the mouth.”\r\n\r\n“Suitable also against toothache are fumigations made with the seeds of\r\nthe hyoscyamus scattered on burning charcoal; these must be followed\r\nby rinsings of the mouth with hot water; in this way sometimes, as it\r\nwere, small worms are expelled.”[171]\r\n\r\nThis passage of Scribonius Largus has given rise to the idea that the\r\ndental caries depends upon the presence of small worms, which eat\r\naway the substance of the tooth. Such an explanation must have well\r\nsucceeded in satisfying the popular fancy; and it is for this that\r\nsuch a prejudice, although fought against by Jacques Houllier in the\r\nsixteenth century, has continued even to our days.\r\n\r\nWith regard to this I would like to record the following fact: Not many\r\nyears ago there lived in Aversa, a small town near Naples, Italy, a\r\ncertain Don Angelo Fontanella, a violin player, who professed himself\r\nto be the possessor of an infallible remedy against toothache. When\r\nsummoned by the sufferer, he carried with him, in a bundle, a tile,\r\na large iron plate, a funnel, a small curved tube adjustable to the\r\napex of the funnel, a piece of bees’ wax, and a small packet of onion\r\nseed. Having placed the tile on a table, the iron plate was put upon\r\nit, after it had been heated red hot. Then the operator let a piece\r\nof bees’ wax fall upon the red-hot iron, together with a certain\r\nquantity of the onion seed; then, having promptly covered the whole\r\nwith the funnel and made the patient approach, he brought the apex of\r\nthe said funnel close to the sick tooth, in such a way as to cause the\r\nprodigious, if somewhat stinking, fumes produced by the combustion of\r\nthe wax with the onion seed to act upon it. In the case of a lower\r\ntooth, the above-mentioned curved tube was adapted to the funnel, so\r\nthat the fumes might equally reach the tooth. The remedy, for the most\r\npart, had a favorable result, whether because the beneficial effect was\r\ndue to the action of the hot vapor on the diseased tooth, or to the\r\nactive principles resulting from the combustion of the wax and onion\r\nseed, or to both, or perhaps also, at least in certain cases, to the\r\nsuggestion that was thus brought to bear upon the sufferer. It would\r\nnot be at all worth while to discuss here such a point. The interesting\r\npart is that when the patient had declared that he no longer felt\r\nthe pain, Don Angelo, with a self-satisfied smile, turned the funnel\r\nupside down, and showed on its internal surface a quantity of what he\r\npretended to be worms, which he affirmed had come out of the carious\r\ntooth. Great was the astonishment of the patient and of the bystanders,\r\nnone of whom raised the least doubt as to the nature and origin of\r\nthese small bodies, no one having the faintest suspicion even that\r\nthese, instead of coming from the tooth, might come from the onion seed!\r\n\r\nAccording to Scribonius Largus, toothache might also be taken away by\r\nfumigations of burnt bitumen. He affirms also that great benefit may\r\nbe derived against odontalgia by masticating the wild mint, or the root\r\nof the pyrethrum, or by covering the diseased tooth with a plaster\r\ncomposed of peucedanum juice, opopanax, incense, and stoneless raisins.\r\nBut before making use of this last remedy, he advises that the tooth\r\nand the gums near it should be fomented with very hot oil, by means of\r\na toothpick or ear-picker wrapped around, at one end, with some wool.\r\nIf the pain does not entirely cease, or comes on again, it is well,\r\nsays the author, to continue the fomentations with hot oil, above the\r\nplaster, until the pain ceases. To strengthen loose teeth, Scribonius\r\nadvises frequent rinsings of the mouth with asses’ milk or with wine\r\nin which have been cooked the roots of the sorrel until the liquid has\r\nboiled down to one-third. Another remedy which he recommends against\r\nlooseness of the teeth is composed of honey and alum mixed together in\r\na mortar, in the proportion of two parts of the first to one of the\r\nsecond, and then cooked in an earthen vase, so as to render the mixture\r\nmore homogeneous, and to give it more consistency. He also speaks of\r\na third medicament, resulting from cooking strong vinegar, alum, and\r\ncedria[172] in a copper vessel until it has the consistency of honey.\r\nThis remedy would serve not only to make loose teeth firm, but the\r\nauthor assures us also that whoever rubs the teeth with it, three times\r\na month, will never be subject to dental pains.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus gives the receipts for various dentifrice powders in\r\nuse at that period. The skin of the radish dried in the sun, pounded\r\nto powder, and then passed through a sieve, would furnish a good\r\ndentifrice, suited to strengthen the teeth and to keep them healthy.\r\nVery white glass, similar to crystal, reduced to a very fine powder\r\nand mixed with spikenard, is also, according to Scribonius Largus, a\r\nvaluable dentifrice.\r\n\r\nOctavia, sister of Augustus, used a powder which our author highly\r\ncommends, saying that it strengthens the teeth and makes them very\r\nbeautiful.[173] To prepare it, one must take a sextary[174] of barley\r\nflour and knead it well to a paste with vinegar and honey mixed\r\ntogether, and must divide the mass into six balls, each of which must\r\nbe mixed with half an ounce of salt; these balls must then be cooked\r\nin the oven until carbonized; and lastly pounded to powder, as much\r\nspikenard being added as is necessary to give it an agreeable perfume.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus also lets us know the tooth powder made use of by\r\nMessalina, the wife of the Emperor Claudius; this was composed of\r\ncalcined stag’s horn, mastic of Chios, and sal ammoniac, mixed in\r\nthe proportion of an ounce of mastic and an ounce and a half of sal\r\nammoniac to a sextary of the ashes of stag’s horn.\r\n\r\nSERVILIUS DAMOCRATES, a Greek physician, who acquired great renown in\r\nRome toward the middle of the first century, was the author of many\r\nvaluable works, both in verse and prose, which, unfortunately, have\r\nbeen lost. His works are mentioned by Galen, who testifies to his great\r\nesteem for Damocrates, calling him an eminent physician, and quoting\r\nvarious passages from his works, and among others three poetical\r\nreceipts for dentifrice powders. From these receipts it appears that\r\nDamocrates attached the greatest importance to the cleanliness of the\r\nteeth, and that he considered this the indispensable condition for\r\navoiding disease of the teeth and gums.\r\n\r\nANDROMACHUS THE ELDER, of Crete, the physician of Nero, who conferred\r\nupon him, for the first time, the title of _archiater_, became famous\r\nthrough his _theriac_, an extremely complicated remedy, the virtues of\r\nwhich were sung by him in a Greek poem, dedicated to the Emperor. The\r\ntheriac was considered an antidote against all poisons and a remedy\r\nagainst the greater part of diseases, in short, as a real panacea.\r\nIt is not even necessary to remark that this portentous medicine,\r\nwhich has held a post of honor, from ancient times almost up to the\r\npresent day, was also used against odontalgia; and in those cases in\r\nwhich this was produced by caries, Andromachus advised the filling up\r\nof the cavity with the electuary which he rendered so famous. As the\r\nchief basis of the theriac was opium, combined with stimulating and\r\naromatic substances, there is no doubt that its use locally or even\r\ninternally would prove beneficial, temporarily at least, in many cases\r\nof odontalgia.[175]\r\n\r\nARCHIGENES, of Apamea, a city of Syria, lived in Rome toward the end\r\nof the first century and at the beginning of the second, under the\r\nEmperors Domitian, Nerva, Trajan, and Hadrian. He acquired great\r\nfame as a physician and as an operator, and distinguished himself\r\nparticularly by daring amputations and trepannings. He recommends\r\nvarious remedies against odontalgia, among which are mouth washes\r\nof strong hot vinegar, in which gall-nuts or halicaccabum[176] have\r\nbeen boiled. He usually introduced into carious teeth a mixture of\r\nturpentine and vitriol of iron (_sory ægyptium_), or a mixture of\r\npepper, and oil of spikenard or of almonds, and this was also dropped\r\ninto the ear, on the side on which the pain was felt.\r\n\r\nArchigenes, too, like other great physicians of that time, recommended\r\nvarious remedies taken from the animal kingdom against diseases of\r\nthe teeth, which now seem very strange to us, but at that period\r\nappear to have been in great use. Thus, it would be of great benefit\r\nto hold in the mouth for some length of time a mixture of vinegar and\r\nwater in which a frog has been well cooked. The slough of a serpent,\r\nburnt and then reduced, by the addition of oil, to the consistency of\r\nsolidified honey, would be a valuable remedy, which being introduced\r\ninto a carious hollow, and plastered all around the tooth and on the\r\nsurrounding parts, would cause the most violent pain to cease. And,\r\nmoreover, desiring to cause a diseased tooth to fall out, it would be\r\nenough to apply to and press upon it a piece of the unburnt slough of a\r\nserpent. Two excellent anti-odontalgic remedies to be introduced into\r\ncarious hollows would be roasted earth-worms and spikenard ointment\r\nmixed with the crushed eggs of spiders. It would be also of use to drop\r\ninto the ear on the side of the aching tooth some oil of sesamum in\r\nwhich earth-worms have been cooked.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain is situated in broken teeth, Archigenes advises them to\r\nbe cauterized with a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nAgainst bleeding of the gums, he recommends rubbing them with very\r\nfinely pulverized alum and myrtle and the application of astringent and\r\ntonic liquids.\r\n\r\nWhen odontalgia appears to depend upon an inflammatory condition, he\r\nadvises the aching teeth to be plastered up with a mixture composed of\r\nred nitre, pounded peach kernels, and resin.\r\n\r\nArchigenes repeatedly recommends the cleaning of the teeth and of the\r\ncarious cavities before applying to the former or introducing into the\r\nlatter the appropriate remedies.[177]\r\n\r\nBut Archigenes’ principal merit, so far as concerns the art of\r\ndentistry, consists in his having guessed that odontalgia, in certain\r\ncases, arises from a disease of the interior part of the tooth (viz.,\r\nfrom inflammation of the pulp) and in having discovered an excellent\r\nmethod for curing such cases. When a tooth appeared discolored,\r\nwithout being affected by caries, and was the seat of violent pains,\r\nagainst which every remedy had proved of no avail, Archigenes\r\nperforated it with a small trephine, invented by himself for the\r\npurpose. He applied the instrument to that part of the crown which was\r\nmost discolored and drilled right down to the centre of the tooth.[178]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt this talented surgeon was induced to adopt this method of\r\ncure by the idea of the existence of morbid substances in the interior\r\nof the tooth and by the consequent indication of giving them a free\r\nexit.\r\n\r\nThe operation devised by Archigenes proves, among other things, two\r\nimportant facts: first, that the anatomical constitution of the teeth\r\nhad already been explored, seeing that Archigenes did not ignore the\r\nexistence of the pulp cavity; and secondly, that Archigenes was greatly\r\nopposed to the extraction of a tooth unless absolutely necessary.\r\nIt might be thought that such aversion depended upon an exaggerated\r\nidea of the dangers connected with the extraction of a tooth, an idea\r\nwidely diffused at that period; but regarding such a daring surgeon as\r\nArchigenes was, it is more logical to suppose that in similar cases he\r\nhad recourse to trephining and not to extraction, especially on account\r\nof the importance he attached to the preservation of the tooth.\r\n\r\nSurgery in ancient times was eminently conservative; later on—partly\r\nby effect of its own progress—it became too readily inclined to the\r\nremoval of diseased parts; in modern times it has again become what it\r\nwas originally, and what it must ever be, viz., conservative in the\r\nhighest possible degree.\r\n\r\nCLAUDIUS GALEN, after Hippocrates the greatest physician of ancient\r\ntimes, was born at Pergamus, a city in Asia Minor, in the year 131 of\r\nour era. His father Nicon, a man of great abilities, who was at the\r\nsame time a man of letters, a philosopher, a mathematician, and an\r\narchitect, had put him, at a very early age, to the study of science\r\nand of the liberal arts. Galen began to study medicine at the age\r\nof seventeen, under the guidance of skilful doctors of his native\r\ncountry; he made several journeys in order to have the benefit of the\r\ninstruction of celebrated masters, and finally frequented the renowned\r\nmedical school at Alexandria. On going to Rome, in the thirty-fourth\r\nyear of his life, he soon acquired in that city a very high renown.\r\nHe died in the first decade of the third century, but we do not know\r\nexactly in what year.\r\n\r\nGalen was a most prolific writer, and his works, considering the period\r\nin which they were written, form a real medical encyclopedia. Anatomy\r\nthrough his researches made considerable progress, for he studied with\r\nthe utmost care and attention (especially in apes) the bones, muscles,\r\nheart, bloodvessels, brain, nerves, and every other part of the\r\norganism. His anatomical researches enabled him to correct many errors,\r\nbut as he had dissected almost exclusively animals and not human\r\ncorpses, he himself fell into several errors, especially in attributing\r\nto man parts which he does not possess, for example, the intermaxillary\r\nbone.\r\n\r\nGalen justly observed that the inferior maxilla (resulting, according\r\nto him, from the union of two bones, which, indeed, is embryologically\r\ntrue) has in man, proportionally to the other bones of the skeleton, a\r\nlesser length than in animals.\r\n\r\nHe holds that the teeth must be enumerated among the bones, and does\r\nnot admit any doubt to be raised on this point, as these parts can be\r\nlooked upon neither as cartilages, nor as arteries, nor as veins, nor\r\nas nerves, nor as muscles, nor as glands, nor as viscera, nor as fat,\r\nnor as hair—a method of reasoning by elimination which is very specious\r\nbut far too weak!\r\n\r\nGalen indicates exactly the number of incisor, canine, and molar teeth\r\n(without, however, making any distinction between small and large\r\nmolars), and speaks of the different functions of these three kinds of\r\nteeth. Not always, he says, are the molars of each jaw five in number\r\non each side; in some individuals there appear only four; in others\r\nsix. The incisors and canines have but one root; the upper molars have\r\ngenerally three, but sometimes, though not often, four; the lowers have\r\nfor the most part two, rarely three.\r\n\r\nGalen is the first author who speaks of the nerves of the teeth. He\r\nsays that these organs are furnished with soft, that is sensitive,\r\nnerves[179] belonging to the third pair.[180] The teeth, according to\r\nhim, are furnished with nerves, both because, as naked bones, they have\r\nneed of sensibility, so that the animal may avoid being injured or\r\ndestroyed by mechanical or physical agencies, and because the teeth,\r\ntogether with the tongue and the other parts of the mouth, are designed\r\nfor the perception of the various flavors.[181]\r\n\r\nIn regard to odontalgia, Galen made some very important observations on\r\nhis own person:\r\n\r\n“Once when I was troubled with toothache, I directed my attention to\r\nthe seat of the pain, and thus I perceived very clearly, that not only\r\nwas the tooth painful but also pulsating, which is analogous to what\r\nhappens in inflammations of the soft parts. To my astonishment, I had\r\nto persuade myself that inflammation may arise even in a tooth, in\r\nspite of the dental substance being hard and lapideous. But another\r\ntime, when I again was attacked by odontalgia, I perceived very\r\ndistinctly that the pain was not localized in the tooth, but rather in\r\nthe inflamed gums. Having, therefore, suffered these two kinds of pain,\r\nI have acquired the absolute certainty that, in certain cases, the\r\npain is situated in the gums, in others, on the contrary, in the very\r\nsubstance of the tooth.”\r\n\r\nWhen a tooth becomes livid, Galen deduces from this that the tooth\r\nis the seat of a morbid process equivalent to inflammation. Besides,\r\nhe says, we cannot be surprised that the teeth may be subject to a\r\nphlogistic process, when we consider that these, like the soft parts,\r\nassimilate nourishment. The teeth, by effect of mastication, are\r\ncontinually worn down, but nutrition repairs the losses, and they,\r\ntherefore, preserve the same size. But when a tooth from want of its\r\nantagonist is consumed but little or not at all by mastication, we\r\nsee that it grows gradually longer, for the very reason that under\r\nsuch conditions the increase due to nutrition is not counteracted by a\r\ncorresponding waste.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive process of the teeth may, according to Galen, be altered\r\neither by excess or by defect; from which arise morbid conditions,\r\nquite different the one from the other. An excess of nutrition produces\r\na phlogistic process analogous to that of the soft parts; a defect of\r\nnutrition makes the teeth thin, arid, and weak. The first of these\r\npathological states is met with especially in young men and must be\r\nfought against with the ordinary antiphlogistic means, designed to\r\neliminate the excess of humors (evacuant, resolvent, revulsive, and\r\nastringent remedies). As to defect of nutrition, this is met with most\r\nfrequently in old people. It has the effect not only of making the\r\nteeth thin, but also of enlarging the alveoli, from which there results\r\na looseness of the teeth more or less noticeable. Against this morbid\r\ncondition we do not possess, says Galen, any direct remedy; however, it\r\ncan be combated, up to a certain point, by strengthening the gums with\r\nastringent medicaments, so that they may close tightly around the teeth\r\nand thus make them firm.\r\n\r\nDental caries is produced, according to Galen, by the internal action\r\nof acrid and corroding humors, that is, it is produced in the same\r\nmanner as those cutaneous ulcers which appear without any influence\r\nof external causes. The cure must consist in acting upon such\r\nvicious humors by means of local or general medicaments according to\r\ncircumstances and also in strengthening the substance itself of the\r\nteeth by the use of astringents and tonic remedies.[182]\r\n\r\nAfter these preliminary remarks, Galen gives a minute description of\r\nthe numerous remedies which, from his own experience and from that of\r\nother great doctors, were to be considered useful for the cure of the\r\nvarious affections of the teeth and gums.\r\n\r\nAgainst gingivitis and the pains deriving from it, the best remedy,\r\naccording to Galen, consists in keeping in the mouth the oil of the\r\nlentisk moderately warm; noting, however, that such a remedy is the\r\nmore efficacious the more recently it has been prepared.\r\n\r\nA decoction of the root of the hyoscyamus in vinegar, used as a mouth\r\nwash, is another remedy recommended by Galen against the pains in the\r\ngums. It would also be of benefit to apply on the inflamed gums a\r\npowder composed of one part of salt to four of alum, afterward washing\r\nthe mouth with wine or with a decoction of olive leaves. If the gums\r\nare ulcerated, Galen recommends them to be cauterized with boiling\r\noil, using for the purpose a little wool wrapped around a probe or\r\ntoothpick. This medicament, says Galen, greatly modifies the diseased\r\npart, exciting a reparative process in it, to aid which, however,\r\nsuitable remedies must be used, and especially frictions with a mixture\r\nof gall-nuts and myrrh reduced to a fine powder.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of epulides the application of green vitrol, together with\r\nan equal quantity of powdered myrtle and a little alum, is especially\r\nrecommended.\r\n\r\nIn dentition, if the gums are painful, it is advisable to rub them with\r\nthe milk of a bitch. The teeth, moreover, appear very readily, says\r\nGalen, if the gums be rubbed with hare’s brain.\r\n\r\nAgainst odontalgia, properly so called, independent, that is, of\r\ndiseases of the gums, Galen particularly recommends warm applications,\r\neither on the cheek or directly on the tooth. Externally, on the side\r\nof the pain, may be applied dirty (!) pieces of linen, well warmed,\r\nor else small bags full of roasted salt, or cataplasms of linseed\r\nor barley flour. But if it is desired to act directly upon the sick\r\ntooth, this may be rubbed with a branch of origanum (wild marjoram)\r\ndipped in hot oil, or else, after applying a bit of wax on the tooth,\r\nthe heated end of a probe may be laid upon it; or lastly, fumigations\r\nmay be made by burning the seeds of the hyoscyamus. In case the above\r\nremedies, or others like them, be found of no use, Galen recommends\r\nthem to be adopted anew after having perforated the sick tooth by means\r\nof a small drill. But if even from this no benefit be derived, and it\r\nis considered well to remove the tooth, this can be done without pain\r\nby the application of special medicaments. Among these the root of\r\npyrethrum kept in very strong vinegar for forty days and then pounded\r\ntakes the first place. The remedy is applied after having well cleaned\r\nthe sick tooth, and after having covered the others with wax. At the\r\nend of an hour the tooth will have already become so loose that it can\r\nbe drawn out with the fingers or with the mere help of a style. The\r\nsame effect may be obtained, says Galen, by the application of blue\r\nvitriol mixed with very strong vinegar.\r\n\r\nTo prevent a carious tooth from producing pain or fetor, he advises the\r\ncarious hollow to be filled up with black veratrum mixed to a paste\r\nwith honey.\r\n\r\nTo restore to blackened teeth their whiteness, Galen advises them to\r\nbe rubbed with special medicaments, one of which is made up of dried\r\nfigs, burnt and pounded, with spikenard and honey. He gives, besides\r\nthe receipts of many dentifrice powders and tinctures designed both to\r\nstrengthen the teeth and gums and as preservatives against the diseases\r\nof these parts. Such powders and tinctures do not offer any interest\r\nto us, since they do not much differ from those recommended by other\r\nauthors whom we have previously quoted.\r\n\r\nWhen one or more teeth, in consequence of a trauma, or from other\r\ncause, become loose and project above the level of the others, Galen\r\nremoves the whole exuberant part by means of a small iron file. In\r\nperforming this operation, after having covered the gums with a soft\r\npiece of cloth, he holds the tooth to be filed steady with the fingers\r\nof the left hand, using the file in such a way as not to give the tooth\r\nany shock. Besides, he does not complete the operation at one sitting,\r\nbut rather interrupts it as soon as the patient feels any pain, and\r\ncontinues it after one or two days. In the meanwhile, he makes use of\r\nremedies suited to strengthen the loosened teeth, and bids the patient\r\nremain silent and nourish himself with liquid or soft food.\r\n\r\nWhen the teeth, without the action of external causes, become loosened,\r\nGalen holds that this is due to a relaxation of the dental nerve in\r\nconsequence of an excessive abundance of humors. In such cases he\r\ncounsels the use of desiccative remedies.\r\n\r\nGalen, like ancient authors in general, is not very favorable to\r\nthe extraction of teeth with the forceps. Even he seems convinced\r\nthat a tooth may be made to fall out, without pain, by means of the\r\napplication of certain remedies, to which we have already alluded.\r\nHowever, in one of the Galenic books[183] we find the precept already\r\ngiven by Celsus, that before extracting a tooth the gums must be\r\ndetached all around; from which one may argue that, at least in certain\r\ncases, instrumental extraction was considered inevitable. Galen even\r\nalludes to the pain which sometimes remains after the extraction of a\r\ntooth, and is of the opinion that this depends upon an inflammatory\r\ncondition of the stump of the dental nerve.\r\n\r\nIn Galen are found recorded many means of cure, recommended by\r\ncelebrated doctors of ancient times. Elsewhere we have already spoken\r\nof some remedies counselled by Damocrates, by Andromachus the elder,\r\nand by Archigenes. Apollonius, as a medicament against odontalgia,\r\nadvised that the juice of the beet root be dropped into the nostrils,\r\nor else a liquid prepared from cumin seed, myrrh, cucumber, and\r\nwoman’s milk. Heraclides of Tarentum recommended against the pains and\r\nlooseness of teeth that a vinous decoction of black veratrum, mandrake,\r\nand hyoscyamus root should be kept in the mouth. Criton prescribed, for\r\nstrengthening loose teeth, that the mouth should be frequently washed\r\nwith a vinous decoction of lentisk, myrtle, and gall-nuts.\r\n\r\nCELIUS AURELIANUS. In the book _De morbis acutis et chronicis_, written\r\nby Celius Aurelianus (who lived, according to some, in the third\r\ncentury, according to others, in the fourth or at the beginning of the\r\nfifth), a very interesting chapter on odontalgia is found. He shows\r\nhimself to be, for the most part, a follower of Celsus. During the\r\nviolence of the pain he advises abstinence from food and rest in bed\r\nwith the head somewhat raised. As remedies he recommends several mouth\r\nwashes (infusions or decoctions made with wine or vinegar and with\r\nvarious drugs: ironwort, acacia, mercury herb, mandrake, cinquefoil,\r\npoppy, verbascum, hyoscyamus, figs, stag’s horns, etc.), and besides,\r\nthe application of wool soaked in hot oil on the cheek of the affected\r\nside, or the application of little warm bags, and also that some hot\r\noil, or the juice of fenugreek,[184] should be kept in the mouth,\r\nor milk with honey. When the pain is excessively violent, he has\r\nrecourse to bloodletting, and after two days’ fasting, he begins to\r\nfeed the patient with liquid and warm food. If the bowels are closed\r\nhe prescribes the use of clysters, and when, in spite of all, the\r\npain persists, he has recourse to scarified cuppings on the cheek, in\r\ncorrespondence with the pain. In certain cases he also proceeds to\r\nscarification of the gums, or else he detaches them all around from\r\nthe tooth, by means of a special instrument called a _pericharacter_.\r\nIt would often turn out useful to apply to an aching tooth a grain of\r\nincense warmed by the fire and wrapped in a thin piece of cloth, or to\r\npress between the teeth, where the pain is situated, several pieces of\r\ncloth, in succession, in which some powder of incense has been wrapped,\r\nand which are dipped into hot oil before being used. The author,\r\nmoreover, commends external fomentations made by means of sponges\r\nsoaked with emollient decoctions and afterward squeezed; and also the\r\napplication of moderately hot cataplasms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33\r\n\r\nRoman dental forceps found (1894) at Hamburg, Germany, in the ancient\r\nRoman castle Saalburg. (Geist-Jacobi.)]\r\n\r\nWhen the odontalgia has already become inveterate and recurs in\r\nparoxysms, separated by intervals of calm, Celius Aurelianus counsels,\r\namong other things, that the general health be strengthened by\r\ntemperate living, exercise, rubbing of the whole body (an ancient\r\npractice, now revived under the name of massage). He recommends,\r\nbesides, special rubbing of the cheeks (to be carried out with a rough\r\ncloth), and also of the gums and teeth, and indicates a great number\r\nof medicaments, some of which are to be used during the paroxysms and\r\nothers during the periods of calm. In regard to the use of narcotics,\r\nhe very shrewdly observes that such remedies take away sensibility but\r\nnot pain. Some doctors of those days, for the cure of odontalgia, had\r\nrecourse to sternutatories, or to the dropping of special medicaments\r\ninto the nose or into the ear, but Celius Aurelianus seems to have\r\nput but little faith in such means of cure. He, moreover, solemnly\r\nreproaches those who, to cure odontalgia, are too hasty in having\r\nrecourse to the extraction of the aching tooth. To remove a part,\r\nsays he, is not to cure it; and if every tooth that aches has to be\r\nextracted, it would be necessary to draw them all out when they all\r\nache. Therefore, before having recourse to extraction, every other\r\nmeans of cure should first be tried. If the removal of the tooth\r\nbecomes indispensable, he advises that it should never be performed\r\nduring the violence of the pain, for from this serious consequences\r\nmight arise (a prejudice which has not yet entirely vanished, and\r\nwhich is met with, sometimes, not only among common people, but even\r\namong physicians); and a still greater danger would be the extraction\r\nof teeth neither carious nor loose, seeing that, by consensus, the\r\nmuscles, the eyes, and the brain might suffer. The author, on this\r\npoint, quotes Herophilus and Heraclides of Tarentum, who related\r\nsome cases in which the extraction of a tooth was followed by death.\r\nHe alludes, moreover, to a passage of Erasistratus, regarding the\r\n“odontagogon of lead” (_plumbeum odontagogum_) which was exposed in\r\nthe temple of Apollo at Delphi; as much as to show that it was not\r\nlawful to extract teeth other than those which were so loose that an\r\ninstrument of lead was sufficiently strong to extract them.\r\n\r\nWhen the looseness of the teeth seems to depend upon the flaccidity\r\nof the gums, Celius Aurelianus recommends astringent mouth washes:\r\ndecoctions of rind of pomegranate, of gall-nuts, of acacia, of quince,\r\nof myrtle berries, etc.; and besides these, lentiscine oil and asses’\r\nmilk, which latter was also believed to possess astringent virtues.\r\nAgainst hemorrhages of the gums, he advises the use of very fine coral\r\npowder, or of alum with honey.\r\n\r\nGNAEUS MARCELLUS EMPIRICUS, of Burdigala (Bordeaux), who lived at the\r\nend of the fourth century and at the beginning of the fifth, wrote\r\na book, _De medicamenti_, which shows, more than anything else, the\r\ndecadence of the medical science in those days. Regarding the diseases\r\nof the teeth and their cure, Marcellus does not tell us anything new.\r\nHe freely copies Scribonius Largus and other authors, not adding\r\nanything save a few methods of cure, which are exceedingly strange\r\nand superstitious. To get rid of toothache, it is sufficient that the\r\npatient, when the moon is waning, and in the days of Mars (Tuesday)\r\nor of Jupiter (Thursday), repeat seven times the words _argidam_,\r\n_margidam_, _sturgidam_. It is a great pity that a curative method so\r\nsimple and easy be efficacious in two days of the week alone, and even\r\nthen on condition that the moon be waning.\r\n\r\nThe following method is also a very good one: Whilst in the open\r\ncountry, one must take a frog by the head, open its mouth and spit into\r\nit, then having begged the animal to take the toothache with it, must\r\nreplace it on the ground and let it free. To remove loose teeth easily,\r\nit is necessary to keep in reserve some juice of black ivy mixed with\r\na little green oil; in case of necessity, the nose of the patient\r\nmust be anointed with it, and after having drawn a deep inspiration,\r\nhe must put a little stone between his teeth, and stay with his mouth\r\nopen, inclined a little forward, so as to let all the morbid humor\r\nflow out, which sometimes flows very abundantly and even may reach to\r\nthree herminæ.[185] Having afterward rubbed the nose with pure oil, and\r\nwashed the mouth with wine, the teeth will be free from every pain and\r\nmay be very easily pulled out. If the root[186] of a tooth be rubbed\r\nwith dried African sponge, the tooth will fall out within three days;\r\nnaturally, says the author, care must be taken not to touch, whilst\r\ndoing this, any healthy tooth. He who desires never to be subject to\r\npain in the teeth, may obtain this end by the following method: When\r\nat the beginning of spring he sees the first swallow, he must go in\r\nsilence to some running water, take some of it in his mouth, rub his\r\nteeth with the middle fingers of both his hands, and say: “_Hirundo,_\r\n_tibi dico, quomodo hoc in rostro iterum non erit, sic mihi dentes non\r\ndoleant toto anno._”[187]\r\n\r\nThe same must be done each following year, so as to continue to enjoy\r\nthe effects of such a cure!\r\n\r\nADAMANTIUS, an Alexandrine philosopher and physician, who probably\r\nlived in the fourth century, paid much attention to the diseases of\r\nthe teeth, as may be argued from two chapters of the _Tetrabiblos_\r\nof Ætius. One of these chapters is entitled, according to the Latin\r\ntranslation of Giano Cornario: “Cura dentium a calido morbo doloroso\r\naffectorum, ex Adamantio, sophista.”[188] This writer clearly belonged\r\nto the pneumatic school, founded as early as 69 A.D. by Athenæus\r\nof Cilicia. According to the pneumatics (so called, because they\r\nadmitted the existence in the animal organism of an aëriform principle,\r\n_pneuma_, to which they attributed great importance), heat and dryness\r\ngave rise to acute maladies; the phlegmatic affections generally arose\r\nfrom humidity, and melancholy was brought on by cold and dryness, as\r\nevery object dries up and becomes cold on the approach of death. The\r\nauthor says that the cure must vary according as the disease affects\r\nin a greater degree the gums or the teeth themselves with or without\r\nparticipation of the dental nerves and neighboring parts. He makes,\r\nin regard to this, many subtle distinctions; but the remedies which\r\nhe counsels do not offer to us any special interest, being almost\r\nidentical with those that had been recommended by Galen and by other\r\ndoctors prior to Adamantius. The latter also gives much importance\r\nto dietetic therapy; he prescribes that such patients should nourish\r\nthemselves with pottages of barley, or of spelt, with eggs, lettuce,\r\npumpkins, and other cooling food, abstaining, however, from wine.[189]\r\n\r\nThe author enumerates among the causes of such dental affections the\r\ndryness of the air, the autumnal season, the dry constitution of the\r\nindividual, a troubled life, and scanty nourishment. The use of sour\r\nand piquant substances is not favorable to these patients, so much so\r\nthat the mulberry preserve produces, not unfrequently, violent dental\r\npains in them. Adamantius, therefore, advises, in such cases, not to\r\nuse strongly astringent mouth washes, but rather lenitive, moistening,\r\nand emollient substances; simple lukewarm water, decoction of bran,\r\nlicorice juice, starch with boiled must of wine diluted with warm\r\nwater, milk, especially asses’ milk, decoction of mallows and the\r\nlike.[190]\r\n\r\nThe work of Adamantius from which Ætius has taken the above-mentioned\r\nchapters is lost to us. Of his writings there only remain to us\r\nthe treatise _on the winds_ and the one _on physiognomics_. In this\r\nlatter book the author attributes great importance to the canine teeth\r\nas physiognomonic elements, and from their shape and size he makes\r\ndeductions in regard to the character of the individual.\r\n\r\nORIBASIUS (316 to 403), the most celebrated of all the compilers who\r\nappeared during that long period of decadence, wrote, by order of the\r\nEmperor Julian the Apostate, whose physician and friend he was, a\r\nwhole medical encyclopedia and later on a summary (synopsis) of this\r\nsame work of his. In the books of Oribasius are found many things\r\nabout dentition and diseases of the teeth, but they are all taken,\r\nsubstantially, from preceding authors, and therefore it is not worth\r\nwhile repeating them.\r\n\r\nÆTIUS OF AMIDA, a celebrated Greek writer on medicine, lived at the\r\nend of the fifth century, and at the beginning of the sixth, and has\r\nalso left us a kind of medical encyclopedia, which, being divided into\r\nfour sections, each composed of four books, was called _Tetrabiblos_.\r\nHe teaches that the mucous membrane of the gums, tongue, and mouth\r\nis provided with nerves from a portion of the third pair of cerebral\r\nnerves, and that the teeth, too, by a small hole existing at the end\r\nof every root, receive tiny ramifications of sensitive nerves, having\r\nthe same origin. The nutrition of the teeth is understood by Ætius in\r\nthe following way: The nourishment which reaches the dental nerves is\r\nnot entirely assimilated by them; these only appropriate the liquid or\r\nsoft part and reject the drier part. This accumulates in the alveoli,\r\nbecomes by degrees more tenacious and denser, finally being transformed\r\ninto osseous substance and forming the nutriment of the teeth; these,\r\ntherefore, tend to grow continually, although the waste arising from\r\nthe mechanical action of mastication prevents them from undergoing\r\nany real or visible growth. On the other hand, in the old, from the\r\nweakening of the nutritive functions, the teeth become thin and loose,\r\nand finally fall out.[191]\r\n\r\nÆtius advises that during dentition hard objects to chew should not be\r\ngiven to children, seeing that the gums being hardened by these and\r\nbecoming almost callous would render the cutting of the teeth very\r\ndifficult.[192]\r\n\r\nFor curing parulides, he recommends emollients at the beginning of the\r\ndisease, and later on astringents. But if the inflammation of the gums\r\ndoes not resolve and passes into suppuration, he prefers to perform the\r\nexcision of the parulis, instead of making a simple incision, which\r\nmight very easily cause the abscess to change into a fistula.[193]\r\n\r\nThe epulis, according to Ætius, is a fleshy excrescence of the\r\ngums, brought on by inflammation. To cure it, he uses, during the\r\ninflammatory period, emollients, and then, when the inflammation has\r\nsubsided, astringents and weak caustics. Lastly, if the epulis resist\r\nthese remedies, he takes hold of it with a vulsella and proceeds to\r\nremove it with a small scalpel.[194]\r\n\r\nWhen the incision of a fistula of the gums and the use of appropriate\r\nremedies are not sufficient for curing it, Ætius advises the extraction\r\nof the diseased tooth, from which the fistula has its origin.[195]\r\n\r\nApart from what has been mentioned, Ætius does not tell us, in regard\r\nto dental diseases, anything worthy of note, and in many places he only\r\nrepeats Galen’s observations.\r\n\r\nPAUL OF ÆGINA (seventh century) establishes a very clear distinction\r\nbetween epulis and parulis. The epulis is a fleshy excrescence of the\r\ngums in the neighborhood of a tooth; the parulis is an abscess of the\r\ngums. To cure the former affection it is necessary, says the author,\r\nto seize and stretch the tumor with a vulsella or with a hook and to\r\nperform its excision. As to the parulis, although not unfrequently it\r\nis sufficient, for curing it, to give an exit to the pus by means of\r\na slight incision, the author, however, usually prefers the method of\r\ncure recommended by Ætius, viz., excision. After such operations he\r\norders the patient to rinse his mouth with wine and on the morrow with\r\nhydromel.[196] From the third day onward he sprinkles the wound with\r\na cicatrizing powder, until a complete cure is obtained. But if the\r\nwound, instead of healing, be transformed into a putrid ulcer resisting\r\nall the ordinary means of cure, it is necessary to cauterize the part\r\naffected with an oval-shaped cautery.[197]\r\n\r\nIn extracting a tooth, the operation is begun by detaching the gum all\r\naround it as far as the alveolar border; then the tooth is seized with\r\nthe forceps, shaken loose, and drawn out. Paul of Ægina, like Celsus,\r\nrecommends that before extracting a tooth deeply attacked by caries,\r\nthe cavity be filled up with lint, in order to avoid the crumbling of\r\nthe tooth under the pressure of the instrument. On the other hand, he\r\ntoo is convinced that a diseased tooth can be made to fall out without\r\npain, by the use of suitable remedies.\r\n\r\nWhen supernumerary teeth cause an irregularity of the dental arches,\r\nthis must be corrected, says the author, either by resection of such\r\nteeth, if they are very firm, or by their extraction.\r\n\r\nIf a tooth projects above the level of the others, the protruding part\r\nmust be removed with the file. This instrument must also be employed to\r\nremove the sharp edges of broken teeth.\r\n\r\nTartar incrustations must be removed either with scrapers or by means\r\nof a small file.[198]\r\n\r\nDuring the period of dentition one must not give children any food\r\nwhich requires mastication, and to soften the gums they must be\r\nanointed with hen’s fat or with hare’s brain.[199]\r\n\r\nTo preserve the teeth and to keep them healthy, Paul of Ægina\r\nrecommends all tainted food to be avoided, and also all possibility of\r\nindigestion and frequent vomitings; the use of very hard or glutinous\r\nfood or of such as may easily leave a residuum between the teeth, for\r\nexample, dried figs, and likewise very cold food and such as set the\r\nteeth on edge. He also advises that hard things should never be broken\r\nwith the teeth and that the latter be carefully cleaned, especially\r\nafter the last meal of the day.[200]\r\n\r\nPaul of Ægina also belongs to the class of compilers; but in utilizing\r\nthe writings of the great physicians who had preceded him, he gives\r\nevidence of exquisite good sense, and not infrequently subjects the\r\nassertions of his predecessors to an intelligent and enlightened\r\ncriticism. Besides, he inserts here and there observations and\r\nexperiences of his own that are not without interest. He has always\r\nbeen, and rightly so, considered one of the greatest physicians of\r\nancient times, the great reputation which he justly held among the\r\nArabs contributing not a little to his renown.\r\n\r\nThis author is the last of the Byzantine period, and with him,\r\ntherefore, we must close the earlier part of the history of dentistry.\r\nIf, before passing to the middle period, we cast a glance over the\r\nground already traversed, it is easy to perceive that dental art, in\r\nancient times, reached its highest degree of development at the time\r\nwhen the Roman civilization was in its greatest splendor, when, in the\r\ncapital of the world, wealth, luxury, and the refinements of social\r\nlife marvellously increased its needs, and by this also gave an impulse\r\nto the evolution of all human activity. But ancient civilization,\r\nafter having reached its culminating point, soon fell into decadence,\r\nand this necessarily would result in a hindrance to the development\r\nof dental art. From the days of Archigenes right up to those of Paul\r\nof Ægina, dentistry did not make the least progress; indeed, as far\r\nas prosthetic dentistry is concerned, there was probably a retrograde\r\nmovement, it being very likely that when Italy was subject to the\r\ndominion of the barbarians and when Christianity—which but recently had\r\nasserted itself—was strongly imposing on the human mind a deep contempt\r\nfor all that regarded the welfare and beauty of the human body, no one\r\ncould, any longer, think of artificially repairing the losses sustained\r\nby the dental system through disease or injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nSECOND PERIOD—THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ARABIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religious fanaticism excited by Islamism, transformed the obscure\r\nand nomad inhabitants of Arabia into a conquering nation, who very soon\r\nextended their power over a considerable part of Asia, Africa, and\r\nEurope. Spain, invaded by the Arabs in 711, fell almost entirely into\r\ntheir hands. After having by force of arms rendered themselves powerful\r\nand dreaded, the Arabians acquired also great fame by the culture of\r\nart and science within the limits allowed them by their religious\r\ncode; and in these, for more than four centuries, they maintained an\r\nincontestable preëminence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, as the Koran most absolutely prohibited the dissection\r\nof dead bodies, all serious anatomical research was thereby rendered\r\nimpossible. This was a very great hindrance to the progress of anatomy,\r\nof physiology, and, in consequence, of the whole of medical science.\r\nThe Arabians certainly had the merit of keeping alive the study of\r\nmedicine in an age of decadence and barbarism; but, apart from the\r\nimportant progress realized by them in chemistry and pharmacology,\r\nit may be affirmed that the Arabs contributed but scantily to the\r\ndevelopment of the healing art; they followed almost entirely in the\r\nfootsteps of Galen and other ancient, and especially Greek, authors.\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristics of Arabian medical art consists in the\r\naversion to bloody operations and in the effort to avoid them. A like\r\ntendency shows itself also in the sphere of dentistry; the Arabians,\r\neven more than their Greek and Roman predecessors, were reluctant to\r\nextract teeth, and employed all possible means, in order to avoid the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nRHAZES (or more precisely, Abu Bekr Muhammed ben Zacarja er Rhazi) was\r\nborn in Persia toward the middle of the ninth century, and gave himself\r\nup to the study of medicine when about thirty years of age, having\r\npreviously been a musician. He wrote many works which, unfortunately,\r\nhave, for the most part, been lost. Rhazes did not have recourse to\r\nthe extraction of teeth, save as a last resource when every other\r\nattempt at cure had proved useless; which method would no doubt have\r\ndeserved high praise, had the author been inspired by the principles of\r\nconservative surgery, rather than by unjustifiable fears. Caries of the\r\nteeth is, according to him, identical with that of the bones. To hinder\r\nits progress and propagation to the neighboring teeth, he advises the\r\ncarious cavity to be filled with a “cement” composed of mastic and\r\nalum. We have here a laudable attempt at permanent stopping of decayed\r\nteeth, although it is clear that the duration of such stopping, owing\r\nto the nature of the materials employed, could not be a long one.\r\nFurthermore, he counselled the patient to abstain from the use of acid\r\nfood or drink and to rub the teeth with powder of gall-nuts and pepper.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen loosened teeth, he recommended astringent mouth washes\r\nand sundry dentifrice powders. Others, partly taken from Galen, are\r\nrecommended by him for prophylactic purposes and for cleansing and\r\nbeautifying the teeth.\r\n\r\nAgainst periodontitis and the pains produced by it, he sometimes had\r\nrecourse to bleeding. He commended, besides, opium, oil of roses,\r\npepper, and honey, and also the scarification of the gums and the\r\napplication of a leech. If, however, these remedies did not succeed, he\r\napplied his theriac, which was composed of castoreum, pepper, ginger,\r\nstorax, opium, and other ingredients, to the roots of the teeth. If\r\neven this method of cure failed, he touched the root of the diseased\r\ntooth with a red-hot iron, or sought to provoke its fall by the use\r\nof special medicaments, such as coloquintida and arsenic (a substance\r\nto which he had recourse, particularly in those cases where there was\r\nulceration of the gums). It is no wonder that such means of cure would\r\nsometimes produce, as a final result, the actual falling out of the\r\ntooth; and this, as is natural, served to strengthen the belief that\r\nthe same result could also be obtained with less energetic remedies,\r\nbut which were supposed to be equally endowed with expulsory virtues.\r\n\r\nRhazes relates an interesting case of regeneration of a whole lower\r\njaw; he, however, observes that the newly formed osseous mass was less\r\nhard than the original bone.[201]\r\n\r\nALI ABBAS, another great Persian physician (who died in 994), wrote a\r\nlengthy treatise on theoretic and practical medicine, one chapter of\r\nwhich is dedicated to the diseases of the teeth. When a molar tooth\r\nis affected by caries, and the pain cannot be subdued in any other\r\nway, Ali Abbas applies, inside the carious cavity, the end of a small\r\nmetallic tube, into which he repeatedly introduces red-hot needles,\r\nleaving them in the tube until quite cooled. Should even this have no\r\neffect, he tries to provoke the fall of the tooth by the application of\r\nasses’ milk with assafetida, or, finally, extracts it.[202]\r\n\r\nHe cures epulis, like Paul of Ægina, by excision. As to parulis, or\r\nabscess of the gums, he opens it with a lancet or a wooden stylus.\r\n\r\nWhen the dental arch is deformed by the existence of supernumerary\r\nteeth, he removes these with an instrument in the shape of a beak.[203]\r\n\r\nSERAPION (Jahiak Ebn Serapion), who lived in the tenth century, and\r\nup to the beginning of the eleventh, contributed but slightly to the\r\ndevelopment of medicine and dentistry, as he was in his writings little\r\nmore than a mere compiler. He indicates with great precision the number\r\nof dental roots, and expresses an opinion that the upper molars have\r\nneed of their three roots in order to keep firm in spite of their\r\npendent position, whilst two roots alone are sufficient to keep the\r\nlower molars in place, on account of the support which they receive\r\nfrom the jaw. Serapion, like Galen, admits the nutrition and continual\r\ngrowth of the teeth—a growth which is produced in the same proportion\r\nas the waste due to mastication—and he too makes the dental diseases\r\ndepend upon an alteration in the nutritive process, either by excess or\r\nby defect.\r\n\r\nAgainst dental pains of phlogistic origin, he recommends bloodletting,\r\npurgatives, and many local medicaments, reproduced in great part from\r\nRhazes. In cases of persistent odontalgia due to caries, he advises, as\r\nan excellent remedy, the application of opium in the carious cavity.\r\nTo strengthen loosened teeth, he first employs astringents, and if\r\nthese are of no use, as often happens in the old, he binds the loose\r\nteeth together and to the neighboring healthy ones, by means of gold or\r\nsilver wire.\r\n\r\nIn Serapion, too, we find many formulas for dentifrice powders, some of\r\nwhich are intended simply for cleaning the teeth, others for special\r\nprophylactic or curative purposes.[204]\r\n\r\nAVICENNA. One of the greatest luminaries of medicine among the Arabs\r\nwas Avicenna (Ebn Sina). He was born in 980 son of a high Persian\r\nfunctionary; he lived a very adventurous life, held some very high\r\nplaces, and died in 1037. Among his works, the most important is the\r\n_Canon_, a book which procured him the title of “second Galen” and the\r\nstill more pompous one of “prince of doctors.” A very evident proof of\r\nthe immense fame which he acquired is the fact that among many oriental\r\npeoples Avicenna, even in our own days, is considered the greatest\r\nmaster of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe anatomy and physiology of the teeth are treated by Avicenna very\r\nminutely, but nevertheless he does not teach us, in regard to these,\r\nanything new. Like Galen, Avicenna admits that the teeth continually\r\ngrow, and as a proof he gives the fact of the lengthening of the teeth,\r\nwhich, owing to the absence of antagonists, are not subject to any\r\npressure or friction.\r\n\r\nHe gives much good advice with regard to the preservation and\r\ncleanliness of the teeth, to which he attaches very great importance;\r\nand on this point he remarks that the use of very hard tooth powders\r\nmust be avoided, as these are liable to injure the dental substance. To\r\nthis latter are also harmful, says the author, some narcotic remedies,\r\nemployed against odontalgia. Burnt hartshorn is, according to him, a\r\nmost valuable dentifrice. To remove tartar from the teeth, he indicates\r\nmany remedies, and especially dentifrices of meerschaum, salt, burnt\r\nshells of snails and oysters, sal ammoniac, burnt gypsum (plaster\r\nof Paris), verdigris with honey, etc. Among the substances able to\r\nfacilitate dentition, he enumerates several oils and fats, besides the\r\nbrain of the hare and the milk of the bitch, and he disapproves the\r\ncustom of giving to children, during dentition, hard objects to chew,\r\nin the erroneous belief that the biting of such objects is useful in\r\nfacilitating the cutting of the teeth; he recommends, instead, the gums\r\nto be rubbed with the fingers. When the teeth begin to appear, he drops\r\nsome oil into the ears of the child and covers its head, neck, and jaws\r\nwith a plaster spread on cotton that has been soaked in oil.\r\n\r\nAvicenna minutely examines the various causes of odontalgia, and among\r\nthem includes also the little worms by which the dental substance was\r\nsupposed to be gnawed away.\r\n\r\nWhen a tooth becomes the seat of intense pain, accompanied by a\r\nthrobbing feeling, Avicenna considers that this is due to an excessive\r\naccumulation of humors in the root; he therefore advises, as already\r\nArchigenes had done, the tooth to be drilled, in order to empty it, and\r\nafterward to introduce into it appropriate remedies.\r\n\r\nAccording to Avicenna, he who has a loosened tooth and desires to make\r\nit firm again, must avoid using it in mastication, must not touch it\r\nwith the fingers, nor move it with the tongue; besides this, he must\r\nspeak as little as possible, and make use of astringent remedies.\r\n\r\nTo remove a tooth, Avicenna made use of either the forceps or the\r\n“eradicating remedies,” in which he, too, had full confidence. Like\r\nthe greater part of his predecessors, Avicenna is of the opinion that\r\nthe extraction of a firm tooth must be avoided as much as possible, as\r\nit may give place to an injury of the jaw, or become harmful to the\r\nvisual organ, or bring on fever. On this point he remarks that, if an\r\naching tooth appears to be sound, it is not always necessary to perform\r\nits extraction in order to cause even the most rebellious odontalgia\r\nto cease; in certain cases he obtained a complete cessation of the\r\npain after having simply shaken the tooth without completing its\r\nextraction; which according to him was due to the double reason that by\r\nshaking the tooth a resolution of the morbid matter stagnating under it\r\nis provoked, and the action of the medicaments that are afterward made\r\nuse of is thus favored.\r\n\r\nAmong the eradicating remedies, the author enumerates white arsenic,\r\norpiment, coloquintida, tithymallus, the fat of frogs, and others. He\r\nremarks, however, that before using them it is advantageous to detach\r\nthe gum all around.\r\n\r\nAgainst the supposed worms in carious teeth, he praises fumigations\r\nmade with the seeds of the hyoscyamus, garlic, or onion.\r\n\r\nArsenic is used by him not only for the above-mentioned purpose, but\r\nalso for the cure of fistulas and foul ulcers of the gums.\r\n\r\nWhen a tooth has become abnormally long, Avicenna makes use of the file\r\nto reduce it to a proper size; and in performing such an operation, he\r\nholds the tooth firmly between the fingers, or with a pair of pincers\r\nsuited for the purpose. As a consecutive treatment, he prescribes\r\nfrictions with alum, laurel berries, and aristolochia.[205]\r\n\r\nABULCASIS. Among the Arabian authors, he who has the greatest\r\nimportance in regard to dental art is undoubtedly Abulcasis\r\n(Abul-Casem-chalaf-ben-Abbas). Whilst Avicenna was one of the greatest\r\nphysicians, Abulcasis was one of the greatest surgeons; and very justly\r\nhe has been called the genius of Arabian surgery.\r\n\r\nAbulcasis had his birthplace in Alzahra, a small Spanish village, five\r\nmiles from Cordova; from this he derived the name of Alzaravius, by\r\nwhich he is also known. Historians are not agreed upon the date of his\r\nbirth. According to the most probable opinion, he was born about the\r\nyear 1050 and died in 1122 at Cordova, a city which, on account of its\r\ncelebrated school, was then a most important centre of scientific and\r\nliterary culture.\r\n\r\nAmong the works of Abulcasis, the one which brought him the greatest\r\nfame was the treatise _De Chirurgia_. It is divided into three\r\nbooks, in the first of which he speaks of all the diseases which can\r\nbe treated by cauterization; in the second are described all the\r\noperations which are performed by cutting, perforating, or extracting\r\n(wherefore, obstetrics is also included in this book); in the third,\r\nlastly, the author treats, region by region, of fractures and luxations.\r\n\r\nChapters XIX, XX, and XXI of the first book have reference to diseases\r\nof the teeth and gums. As these chapters are very short, we are pleased\r\nto give here an almost literal translation of them:\r\n\r\n“When in the lower part of the gums, or in the palate, there appears a\r\nlittle tumor, which afterward becomes purulent and opens and changes\r\ninto a fistula, against which no medical remedy is of any use, it is\r\nnecessary for thee to take a cautery corresponding in size to the\r\naperture of the fistula, and after having heated it, to introduce it\r\nthere and to keep it applied there until the cauterizing iron reaches\r\nthe bottom of the said fistula and beyond. This thou shalt do once or\r\ntwice, and then shalt use fitting medicaments until a complete cure\r\nis obtained. This is attained when suppuration ceases. Otherwise one\r\ncannot do less than uncover the bone and extract that part of it which\r\nis diseased.”[206]\r\n\r\n“When through excess of moisture the gums become flaccid, the teeth\r\nloose, and of no use are the remedies employed by thee, thou shalt lay\r\nthe patient’s head on thy lap, and after having applied to the tooth,\r\nwhere it borders on the gum, the end of an appropriate little metal\r\ntube, in this thou shalt quickly introduce the cautery of which mention\r\nwill be made in the following chapter; and thou shalt prolong the\r\napplication as long as suffices to let the patient feel the heat right\r\nin the root of the tooth. This thou shalt repeat as often as thou shalt\r\nthink necessary. Then the patient shall keep salt water in the mouth\r\nfor an hour. By effect of such a cure, the corrupted moisture will dry\r\nup, the gums will regain their tone, and the tooth its firmness.”[207]\r\n\r\n“When toothache depends upon cold, or if there exist some worm in the\r\ntooth, and the medicaments are of no use, recourse must be made to\r\ncauterization, which in such cases may be performed in two ways, viz.,\r\neither by means of butter or with a cautery. Desiring to use butter,\r\nsome of it must be warmed in an iron or copper spoon; a little cotton\r\nmust then be wrapped around the extremity of a probe, dipped into the\r\nboiling butter, and then immediately applied to the tooth, keeping it\r\nthere in contact until it has cooled. This must be repeated several\r\ntimes, so that the action of the heat reaches right down to the root\r\nof the tooth. If thou preferest, thou canst use cold butter, applied\r\nto the aching tooth by means of a little tuft of wool or cotton, upon\r\nwhich thou shalt lay a red-hot iron; prolonging the application of this\r\nuntil the heat has reached the very root of the tooth.\r\n\r\n“To perform the cauterization directly with the iron, thou must first\r\nrest on the tooth a small tube of iron or copper, designed to preserve\r\nthe neighboring parts from the action of the heat, and which must,\r\ntherefore, be of sufficient thickness. Through such a tube thou shalt\r\napply on the tooth a cautery of the shape given here below, and shalt\r\nkeep it there until it is cooled. This thou shalt do several times.\r\nThe pain will cease the same day or on the morrow. It is, however,\r\nnecessary that after the cauterization the patient should keep his\r\nmouth, for an hour, full of good butter. The shape of the cautery is\r\nas follows (Fig. 34): Thou canst perform the cauterization with one or\r\nother of its two extremities, as is most convenient.”[208]\r\n\r\nIn regard to epulis, Abulcasis prescribes that after catching hold of\r\nthe little tumor with a hook or a vulsella its complete excision should\r\nbe performed. This done, one must wait awhile, until the hemorrhage\r\nceases, and then either a little “zegi” pulverized,[209] or other\r\ndrying and styptic powder, must be applied on the part. If the epulis\r\nrecurs, which very often happens, the excision must be repeated and\r\nthis followed by cauterization, since after this latter the evil will\r\nnot return.[210]\r\n\r\nAbulcasis is the first author who has taken into serious consideration\r\ndental tartar and who has recommended that a scrupulous cleansing of\r\nthe teeth should be performed. The chapter relating to this, “On the\r\nScraping of the Teeth,” is very interesting and is worthy of being here\r\nreproduced.[211]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34\r\n\r\nAbulcasis’ dental cautery and the tube through which it was applied, in\r\norder to preserve the neighboring parts from the action of the heat.]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes on the surface of the teeth, both inside and outside, as\r\nwell as under the gums, are deposited rough scales, of ugly appearance,\r\nand black, green, or yellow in color; thus corruption is communicated\r\nto the gums, and so the teeth are in process of time denuded. It is\r\nnecessary for thee to lay the patient’s head upon thy lap and to scrape\r\nthe teeth and molars, on which are observed either true incrustations,\r\nor something similar to sand, and this until nothing more remains\r\nof such substances, and until also the dirty color of the teeth\r\ndisappears, be it black, or green, or yellowish, or of any other color.\r\nIf a first scraping is sufficient, so much the better; if not, thou\r\nshalt repeat it on the following day, or even on the third or fourth\r\nday, until the desired purpose is obtained. Thou must know, however,\r\nthat the teeth need scrapers of various shapes and figures, on account\r\nof the very nature of this operation. In fact, the scalpel with which\r\nthe teeth must be scraped on the inside is unlike that with which\r\nthou shalt scrape the outside; and that with which thou shalt scrape\r\nthe interstices between the teeth shall likewise have another shape.\r\nTherefore, thou must have all this series of scalpels ready if so it\r\npleases God.”[212]\r\n\r\nThe work of Abulcasis is, so far as we know, the first book in which\r\nare found figures of dental instruments. We do not know, however, how\r\nfar such figures are exact, that is, to what degree of faithfulness\r\nthey represent the instruments which Abulcasis really employed as the\r\noriginal figures of the book of Abulcasis were copied and recopied\r\nby successive transcribers of the work. And that such copies have\r\nbeen very often unfaithful may be deduced from the fact that not\r\nunfrequently figures of surgical instruments are found in the book\r\nwhich do not at all agree with the verbal description which the author\r\ngives of such instruments.\r\n\r\nIn the edition by John Channing, we find at the end of the chapter on\r\nthe scraping of the teeth two series of figures. The first series is\r\nfound under the Arabic text, and is composed of the fourteen figures\r\nreproduced as Fig. 35; the other series, existing under the Latin text,\r\nhas only twelve figures, as shown in Fig. 36.\r\n\r\nAs Channing has made his translation from two different Arabic copies\r\nof Abulcasis,[213] among the corresponding figures of which there\r\nexists a very notable difference, he, for the greater part, had to\r\nfollow the plan of reproducing the figures of both codices. But besides\r\nthis numerical difference, there is also a considerable difference\r\nin the shape of the instruments represented. We must, therefore, ask\r\nourselves which of the two series of figures is to be regarded as the\r\nmore faithful representation of the instruments used by Abulcasis. Most\r\nprobably the first series. In it we find figured some scrapers which\r\nhave a certain resemblance to those actually in use; besides this, the\r\nfigures of the first series seem to be drawn with greater accuracy than\r\nthose of the second. Among other things it may be noticed that the\r\nhandle of each instrument (excepting the last two) is furnished with\r\na row of prominences, which, it is almost certain, were designed to\r\nafford a better grip in holding the scrapers during the operation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35\r\n\r\nSet of fourteen dental scrapers (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36\r\n\r\nTwelve dental scrapers as represented in another manuscript codex of\r\nAbulcasis.]\r\n\r\nWe now consider the chapter on the extraction of teeth.[214] The author\r\nbegins by saying that it is necessary to use all possible means to cure\r\nan attack of odontalgia, and to be very slow in deciding to extract a\r\ntooth, as this is a very noble organ, the want of which cannot in any\r\nway be perfectly supplied. When there is no way of avoiding extraction\r\nand the patient is obliged by pain to submit to this, it is necessary\r\nfirst to ascertain which is the aching tooth, as very often the pain\r\ndeceives the patient, so that he may indicate as the seat of the pain\r\nanother tooth which is perfectly sound, and desire it to be extracted;\r\nafter which, naturally, the pain does not cease, if not when the\r\ndiseased tooth is also extracted, as often happens in the hands of\r\nthe barbers.[215] The aching tooth having been well ascertained, it\r\nis necessary to detach the gum from the tooth, all around, with a\r\nsufficiently strong scalpel. Then either with the fingers or with a\r\nlight pair of forceps the tooth must be shaken very gently, until it\r\nis loosened. Then the surgeon, keeping the head of the patient firmly\r\nbetween his knees, applies a stronger pair of forceps and extracts the\r\ntooth in a straight direction, so as not to break it. If it is not\r\npossible to draw it out, one of those elevators must be taken which the\r\nauthor advises for the extraction of roots (as may be seen afterward),\r\nand by insinuating it under the tooth the surgeon must endeavor to\r\nextract it. When the tooth is corroded and hollow, it is necessary to\r\nfill the cavity with lint, compressing it hard inside with the end of\r\na probe,[216] so that the tooth may not break under the pressure of\r\nthe instrument. In all cases, the operator must take great care not to\r\nbreak the tooth, for if this happens the remaining part will give the\r\npatient still greater suffering. It is necessary, therefore, to avoid\r\nacting like the ignorant and foolish barbers, who in their temerity\r\ndo not observe any of the above-mentioned rules, and therefore very\r\noften cause the patients great injuries, the least among which is the\r\nbreaking of the tooth, the root being left in the socket, or else the\r\ntaking away, together with the tooth, of a piece of the maxillary bone,\r\nas the author often happened to see. After the extraction the patient\r\nmust rinse his mouth with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If, as often\r\nhappens, hemorrhage is produced, a little powdered blue vitriol must be\r\napplied inside the wound; and if this is not sufficient, the part must\r\nbe cauterized with a red-hot iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37, FIG. 38\r\n\r\nForceps for loosening the tooth previous to extraction (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nThe small forceps (Figs. 37 and 38) to be used in loosening the tooth\r\nmust have the handle shorter than the jaws and be sufficiently strong\r\nnot to bend when pressure is put upon the tooth.\r\n\r\nThe large forceps (Figs. 39 and 40) with which the extraction must be\r\nperformed should be made of very good Indian or Damascene iron, and\r\nhave the handle longer than the jaws; these, moreover, on the inside\r\nmust be toothed, or striated after the manner of files, so that they\r\nmay have a perfectly firm grip, without slipping.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing quotations and on examining the annexed figures,\r\nit very clearly appears that the extraction of teeth was performed by\r\nAbulcasis with excessive timidity and in a manner which must have been\r\ntorturing to the poor patients. These had to undergo, first of all, the\r\ndetachment of the gums, then the prolonged shaking of the tooth either\r\nwith the fingers or with the forceps, then the attempt at extraction by\r\nmeans of a stronger pair of forceps, but, so far as can be seen from\r\nthe figure, very little fitted for the purpose; and finally, in many\r\ncases, fresh maneuverings to extract the tooth with an elevator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39, FIG. 40\r\n\r\nForceps for performing the extraction after the tooth has been loosened\r\n(Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nNothing better, in truth, could have been done with such imperfect\r\ninstruments. But it is possible that even then there perhaps existed,\r\nfor the extraction of teeth, other instruments, so shaped as to be\r\nable to act with greater force. Abulcasis himself[217] alludes to the\r\nexistence of dental instruments not mentioned by him. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that the barbers, in spite of the scorn with which Abulcasis\r\noverwhelms them, used, for the extraction of teeth, forceps far more\r\nsuitable than those described by him. These individuals, certainly\r\nunfurnished with a scientific education, must have had, however, a\r\ngreat practice in the extraction of teeth, being perhaps almost the\r\nonly ones to whom recourse was had for this operation. They performed\r\nit very quickly, as may be argued from the words of Abulcasis himself.\r\nIt is no wonder, therefore, that not unfrequently the work of these\r\n_fatui tonsores_[218] was the cause of more or less serious injuries,\r\nbut for the most part it had the advantage of not making the patients\r\nsuffer excessive torture.\r\n\r\nAnother very interesting chapter is that which treats of the extraction\r\nof dental roots and fragments of the maxillary bone.[219]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41, FIG. 42\r\n\r\nForceps for extracting the root when the tooth breaks in the\r\nextraction. These figures are evidently very badly drawn, as are most\r\nof the figures to be seen in Abulcasis’ work.]\r\n\r\nWhen, says the author, on extracting a tooth, this breaks, so that the\r\nroot remains in the socket, it is necessary first of all to soften the\r\npart, by applying for a day and a night, or for two days, some cotton\r\nwool well smeared with butter; then attempts must be made to extract\r\nthe root with a pair of forceps, the jaws of which are like the beak of\r\na pheasant or stork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43\r\n\r\nElevator to be used when the extraction of a root by means of the root\r\nforceps proves impossible (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nIf this is not successful, it is necessary to remove with a scalpel\r\nthe whole of the gum which covers the root; then under it must be\r\ninsinuated a small elevator having the shape here below represented.\r\n\r\nIf not even in this way can the end be attained, recourse must be made\r\nto one of the following instruments, choosing that which in every\r\nparticular case seems to be the most suitable.\r\n\r\nBesides these, says the author, use may be also made of some of the\r\ninstruments which serve for the removal of tartar.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely in this chapter that Abulcasis speaks of the great\r\nvariety and multiplicity of dental instruments; which, he says, cannot,\r\nlike other kinds of instruments, be all enumerated and described.\r\nHe then adds that a skilful surgeon will be able to devise new\r\ninstruments, according as the peculiarities of each single case require\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 45, 46, 47]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48\r\n\r\nElevators (Abulcasis.)]\r\n\r\nFor the extraction of a splinter or necrosed fragment of the maxillary\r\nbone, the same instruments must be used which serve for the extraction\r\nof dental roots; but also a pair of forceps may be used (Figs. 50 and\r\n51).\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to grip with them the osseous fragment firmly, so\r\nthat it cannot escape whilst it is being extracted. The part shall then\r\nbe medicated with fitting remedies.\r\n\r\nWhenever it is thought proper, the bone must be scraped and all the\r\ndiseased part of it removed.\r\n\r\nWhen a tooth is irregularly placed, or projects above the level of\r\nthe others,[220] a deformity ensues which is particularly displeasing\r\nin women. The way of correcting this varies according to the nature\r\nof the case. It consists sometimes in the simple extraction of the\r\nmisplaced tooth. But when there exists an intimate (osseous) union of\r\nthe irregular tooth with another one, it is necessary to operate for\r\nthe resection of the former with an instrument of the following shape,\r\nthat is, like a small axe:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49\r\n\r\nAn instrument like a small axe, for resecting irregularly situated\r\nteeth (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nThe operation must be performed in many days, not only on account of\r\nthe hardness of the tooth, but also in order not to shake any of the\r\nneighboring teeth.\r\n\r\nIn other cases, the deformity, consisting in one tooth projecting above\r\nthe level of the others, may be corrected with a saw.\r\n\r\nThe instrument must be made entirely of Indian iron, and the operation,\r\nlike the preceding one, is to be carried out in several days, that the\r\nfall of the tooth may not be provoked by excessive shaking. The file\r\n(Fig. 55), too, must be used to destroy the edges and points of broken\r\nteeth, that they may not injure the tongue, or give any trouble in\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50, FIG. 51\r\n\r\nForceps for extraction of splinter or necrosed fragments of the\r\nmaxillary bones (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52\r\n\r\nA dental saw (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53\r\n\r\nAnother dental saw (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nWhen, in consequence of a blow or fall, one or more teeth have become\r\nloose so that the patient cannot bite his food with them, if the use\r\nof styptic remedies has been found of no use, it will be necessary to\r\nbind and make such teeth firm by a gold or silver wire. Gold is to\r\nbe preferred as being unalterable, whilst silver in a few days turns\r\ngreen. Having chosen, therefore, a suitable gold wire of perfectly\r\nuniform consistency, it must be passed at its middle part between two\r\nfirm teeth, that is between the two nearest on one side to the loosened\r\ntooth or teeth; then, by binding tightly around the sound tooth and\r\neach of the loosened teeth the two lengths of the wire and crossing\r\nthem in the dental interstices so as to form a kind of network, the\r\nsound and firm tooth of the opposite side will be reached, and this\r\ntoo must be wound around in a mesh, as it were, of the said network.\r\nThen, turning back, the same operation must be repeated, but inversely,\r\nuntil the point of departure is reached. All this must be done with\r\nmuch skill, so as to render the loose teeth completely unmovable. When\r\nthe wire is tied, this must be done near the dental roots, so that the\r\nknot may not get untied; then with a pair of scissors the remaining\r\npart must be cut off and its two ends joined and twisted with a pair of\r\npincers, hiding them between the sound tooth and the neighboring loose\r\none. Such a ligature should remain in place during a whole lifetime;\r\nand in case it should come undone or the wire should break, it will be\r\nnecessary to renew the operation. The following figure represents the\r\nligature described:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54\r\n\r\nLigation for steadying teeth in cases of blow or fall (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes, when one or two teeth have fallen out, they are replaced\r\nin the sockets and bound in the aforesaid manner and remain there.\r\nThe operation must be carried out with great delicacy and ability, by\r\nskilful hands.”\r\n\r\nAs may be seen from the above quotation, in the days of Abulcasis\r\nreplanting was already performed, although it is probable that the\r\nligature was then left permanently.\r\n\r\nThe author says, next, that the vacancy left by fallen teeth can be\r\nfilled up with artificial ones, made of ox bone, they also being fixed\r\nin the manner above described; and he adds that they will be found not\r\nonly of advantage from the esthetic but also from the functional point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cure of the ranula,[221] Abulcasis says that when the\r\ntumor, examined by the clear light of the sun, appears brown or black,\r\nhard and insensible, it is not to be operated, it being then of a\r\ncancerous nature. If, instead, it is whitish and full of liquid, it\r\nmust be seized with a hook, and by means of a fine scalpel extirpated.\r\nThe hemorrhage must be combated with powdered blue vitriol. After the\r\noperation mouth washes must be used of vinegar and salt.\r\n\r\nIn cases of fracture of the lower jaw[222] it is not only necessary\r\nto cure the fracture itself according to the rules which the author\r\nprescribes for the various cases, but it is also necessary to pay\r\nattention to the teeth and with a gold or silver wire, or a silk\r\nthread, to tie, in the manner already described, those teeth which in\r\nconsequence of the wound have become loose, but the consolidation of\r\nwhich may be hoped for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55\r\n\r\nA dental file (Abulcasis).]\r\n\r\nMESUE THE YOUNGER, a disciple of Avicenna, is of opinion that when a\r\ntooth is the seat of violent pain, this may easily propagate itself\r\nto the other teeth; and therefore advises, if the pain does not soon\r\ncease, to extract the tooth affected, without delay. This operation,\r\nhowever, must not be performed, says the author, whilst the pain is at\r\nits height, but rather when it is somewhat lessened, otherwise, the\r\nextraction of the tooth may result in a syncope sometimes ending in\r\ndeath, or else be the cause of intense inflammation and of suppuration,\r\nwhich, also, may, in certain cases, place the patient’s life in danger.\r\nHe recommends an infinite number of remedies against odontalgia; in\r\nthese, however, there is nothing new to us. As to the removal of a\r\ntooth, this may be obtained in three different ways, that is, with\r\nthe forceps, with eradicating remedies, or by cauterization. In\r\norder to cause a tooth to fall out by the use of acrid, eradicating\r\nsubstances, the author advises to proceed in the following manner:\r\nThe tooth is first freed, by means of a scalpel, from the surrounding\r\ngum; the eradicating remedy is next applied to the root of the tooth,\r\nevery needful precaution, however, being taken that it may not injure\r\nthe neighboring teeth. Cauterization, when practised to produce the\r\nexfoliation of a diseased tooth, may be performed, according to Mesue,\r\neither with a small red-hot iron, passed through a little metal tube in\r\norder to protect the neighboring parts, or with the heated kernel of a\r\nnut, or with a grain of burning incense.[223]\r\n\r\nTo cure a dental fistula, Mesue cauterized it to the very bottom with a\r\ncautery in the form of a probe, or extracted the tooth, which by reason\r\nof its diseased root was the cause of the fistula; and when the bone\r\nwas likewise affected, he laid bare the carious part, which he then\r\nscraped.[224]\r\n\r\nAVENZOAR. The last of the great Arabian physicians was Avenzoar. He\r\nwas born at Peñaflor, near Seville, in 1070 and died in 1162. He became\r\nfamous by his very valuable work on medicine, entitled the _Teisir_. It\r\nis strange, however, that in this book there is hardly anything about\r\nthe treatment of dental diseases. Against caries and looseness of the\r\nteeth the author limits himself to recommending bloodletting either\r\nfrom the ranine or the basilic vein. Apart from this, he speaks neither\r\nof operations nor of remedies for diseases of the teeth.[225] Probably\r\nat the time in which Avenzoar wrote, that is, in the first half of the\r\ntwelfth century, doctors in general did not occupy themselves with the\r\ncuring of teeth at all, this being abandoned entirely to barbers and\r\nother persons. This would sufficiently explain why this author is so\r\nsilent in regard to dental diseases.\r\n\r\nBut what can have been the reason for doctors refusing thus\r\ncontemptuously to occupy themselves with so important a branch of\r\ntherapeutics? In every age there have been a great number of ignorant\r\npersons, who either in good faith, or else for imposture, have\r\npractised, within a more or less limited circle, the art of healing,\r\nusually dedicating themselves to some particular class of diseases.\r\nEven in our days, notwithstanding the superabundance of duly qualified\r\ndoctors, there is, especially in certain countries, no small number of\r\nquacks, secretists, bone-setters, chiropodists, and the like. It is,\r\ntherefore, not to be wondered at that in times when dentistry was still\r\nin its infancy there should have been persons more or less ignorant\r\nwho undertook tooth drawing and the concoction and sale of specifics\r\nagainst odontalgia. The doctors, on their part, under the pretext of\r\nbeing unwilling to have anything to do with these individuals, found it\r\nvery convenient to dispense with the cure of dental diseases and with\r\nthe extraction of teeth, this operation being sometimes too difficult\r\nfor them, on account of their want of practice, besides being almost\r\nalways very painful, and considered, even from the most ancient times,\r\ncapable of eventually producing evil consequences, among which, in some\r\ncases, even the death of the patient.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps this was not the only reason for the fact above mentioned.\r\nIn the middle ages the extraction of one or more teeth was sometimes\r\ninflicted as a punishment; for example, for having eaten flesh during\r\nLent,[226] or on those found guilty of felony, for having refused to\r\ncontribute sums of money demanded from them by their liege lord. Now,\r\nas this punishment was carried out on the guilty ones by the executors\r\nof public justice, it is only natural that doctors should have refused\r\nto practise an operation which would have degraded their profession by\r\nbringing it down nearly to the class of the hangman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHIRTEENTH TO FIFTEENTH CENTURIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRUNO OF LONGOBUCCO. After the Arabian period, the first author whom\r\nwe must mention is Bruno of Longobucco, of the school of Bologna,\r\nwho lived in the thirteenth century and wrote a treatise on surgery,\r\nwhich gave him a certain renown.[227] This book, however, contains but\r\nlittle about diseases of the teeth. The author shows himself a great\r\nfriend of the actual cautery, and advises its use in the cure of dental\r\ncaries and of various diseases of the gums. He says nothing about the\r\nextraction of teeth; instead, he recommends, as a means for making\r\na diseased tooth fall out, that the milky juice of the tithymal be\r\napplied around its root after having been reduced to the consistency of\r\npaste by the addition of flour.[228]\r\n\r\nLANFRANCHI, of Milan, another writer of the thirteenth century, who\r\nacquired great fame by his book _Chirurgia magna et parva_—partially\r\ntranslated into German, more than two centuries later, by Otto\r\nBrunfels—also shows himself very timid in the sphere of dentistry,\r\nand to combat dental pains he recommends, by preference, the use of\r\nnarcotics. He is not at all favorable to the extraction of teeth; and\r\nespecially that of the molars is considered by him a very dangerous\r\noperation.[229]\r\n\r\nTEODORICO BORGOGNONI (1205 to 1298), known also under the name of\r\nTeodorico of Cervia, is according to Hæsar the first author who made\r\nmention of sialorrhea following mercurial frictions. Worthy of note,\r\ntoo, is what he says in regard to fistulas of the gums, or, in general,\r\nof the maxillary region. He advises that in every case of this kind\r\nspecial attention be paid to the state of the dental roots; when there\r\nis a discharge of ichorous pus, the roots are certainly affected; and\r\nthen the diseased teeth must all be extracted as soon as possible.[230]\r\n\r\nJOHN GADDESDEN, an English doctor who flourished at Oxford in the\r\nfirst half of the fourteenth century, wrote a very curious medical\r\nbook, taken the greater part from Pliny and the Arabian writers and\r\nentitled _Rosa anglica: practica medicinæ a capite ad pedes_ (English\r\nrose: the practice of medicine from head to foot). In his time many\r\nstrange methods of cure were in use, sometimes simply ridiculous,\r\nand others even filthy; and the _Rosa anglica_ furnishes us with\r\nnot few examples. In order to make a tooth fall, Gaddesden advises\r\nthe application of dried crow’s dung reduced to powder, or else to\r\nanoint it with the fat of a green frog. This last means would be quite\r\ninfallible and would make the tooth fall out on the spot. It had such\r\npower that if peradventure an ox in grazing chews a little frog with\r\nthe grass, its teeth will all fall out on the instant! We do not know\r\nwhether the author himself believed in the marvellous virtues of the\r\nfat of green frogs. It is certain, however, that he enumerates this\r\namong his “secrets,” and says that he has gained much money from it\r\nthrough the mediation of the barbers.\r\n\r\nOther absurdities of the same kind are the following: The brain of the\r\nhare can, by being rubbed on the gums and jaws, serve for two important\r\npurposes, since it has not only the virtue of facilitating dentition,\r\nbut also of making teeth grow again to those who have lost them! The\r\nbrain of a partridge applied to a carious tooth makes it fall in pieces!\r\n\r\nThe treatment of odontalgia embraces, according to Gaddesden, both\r\ngeneral and special means of cure. To the former belong purgatives,\r\nbloodletting, scarifications of the labial and sublingual mucous\r\nmembrane, leeches, the application of scarified cuppings under the\r\nchin. The special means of cure are represented by a great number of\r\nplasters, powders, and ointments, in the composition of which almost\r\nconstantly hyoscyamus and pyrethrum take part. When odontalgia depends\r\non caries, the author advises, among other things, the use of a\r\nred-hot iron. Against the supposed worms of carious teeth he counsels\r\nfumigations with the burnt seeds of hyoscyamus or of leeks. In cases of\r\ndental fistulas, it is necessary to cauterize the fistulous tract, to\r\nextract the diseased tooth, and if the bone be also affected, to scrape\r\nit. To clean the teeth: Gaddesden recommends several dentifrices; some\r\nof which are composed of pulverized cuttle bone, either with addition\r\nof meerschaum, pumice stone, burnt hartshorn, in different proportions\r\nand combinations, or used quite alone; others are made with myrrh and\r\nalum.\r\n\r\nSince Gaddesden affirms the existence of means capable of promoting\r\nthe fall of any tooth, we should suppose that he says nothing about\r\ninstrumental extraction, or at least that he considers it entirely\r\nuseless; for if in order to make a tooth fall out, it be sufficient to\r\nsmear it with frog’s fat, why should there ever be any need to have\r\nrecourse to the very painful extraction by means of the forceps?\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not so; the author treats of instrumental extraction\r\nas a very important operation, without being at all afraid of\r\nbeing reproved for contradicting himself. Besides, to anyone who\r\nthus reproved him he perhaps would have answered, without being\r\ndisconcerted, that it is not always possible to have the fat of frogs\r\nor the dung of crows in readiness.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of a tooth is only justifiable, says Gaddesden, when\r\nall the remedies employed against odontalgia have proved useless and\r\nwhen, on the other hand, the pain has its seat in the tooth itself and\r\nnot in the nerves or gums. Before undertaking the operation, however,\r\nthe patient must be prepared for it with an evacuant cure, that is,\r\nby injections and purgatives. For the operation itself the author\r\nrecommends the same rules given by Celsus, and says, besides, that the\r\nhead of the patient ought to be held firm by an assistant. In certain\r\ncases, the extraction can be performed, better than with the forceps,\r\nby means of an instrument in the form of a lever, broad at one end,\r\nnarrow and sharpened at the other. But when a tooth is very firmly\r\nseated, its extraction is always dangerous; therefore, in such a case,\r\nGaddesden recommends, before having recourse to the operation, the use\r\neither of acrid substances, such as the milky juice of the euphorbiaceæ\r\n(for example, of the tithymal), or else of a red-hot iron; and this,\r\nfor the purpose of promoting the fall of the tooth, or of rendering\r\nit, at least, so far movable that it can be extracted without any\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nGUY DE CHAULIAC, the greatest surgeon of the middle ages, was born\r\nabout 1300, in a little village on the confines of Auvergne, which\r\nstill preserves the name of Chaulhac; he died in 1368. This author\r\nimmortalized his name by a work which even up to the eighteenth\r\ncentury was, as it were, the official code for the teaching of\r\nsurgery. Guy wrote his _Chirurgia magna_ in barbarous Latin—such as\r\nwas then used by the learned; but his book was soon translated into\r\nFrench, Provençal, and afterward also into Italian, English, Dutch,\r\nand Hebrew. E. Nicaise, who, in 1890, gave to the scientific world a\r\nvery valuable new edition of Guy de Chauliac,[231] and who made very\r\naccurate researches on all that regards this author and his work, has\r\nsucceeded in finding in the libraries of Europe and America as many as\r\nthirty-four manuscript copies of the _High Surger_.[232] The survival\r\nof so many copies, in spite of all the destructive agencies which have\r\nbeen in action during more than 500 years, is a very clear proof of the\r\nwide diffusion which this work obtained even before the invention of\r\nprinting.\r\n\r\nGuy’s work was printed for the first time in 1478, and the editions\r\nthat have been published since then in various countries are in all\r\nabout 130.\r\n\r\nThis book is very important for our subject, since we may gather from\r\nit very clearly the condition of dentistry in the fourteenth century;\r\nbut, on the other hand, we see from it, with equal clearness, that\r\nthis branch of the healing art had not made any progress from the\r\ntime of Abulcasis to that of Guy de Chauliac (about two centuries\r\nand one-half), and that this most famous surgeon did not contribute\r\nanything worthy of note to the development of dentistry.\r\n\r\nOn the anatomy and physiology of the teeth Guy de Chauliac expresses\r\nhimself very briefly: “Teeth are of the nature of bones, although they\r\nare possessed of sensibility, due to some nerves which the third pair\r\nsends to their roots. The number of these latter may vary from one to\r\nfour, according to the different teeth. The uses of these organs are\r\nwell known.”[233]\r\n\r\nWorthy of being recorded are the names which Guy gives to the\r\ndifferent kinds of teeth. After having said that these latter are\r\ngenerally thirty-two, but sometimes only twenty-eight, he adds, that\r\nthe sixteen teeth of each jaw are divided into: _deux duelles, deux\r\nquadruples, deux canines, huiet maschelieres[234] et deux caisseaux_\r\n(in the barbarous Latin: _duo duales, duo quadrupli, duo canini,\r\nocto molares et duo caysales_). So that the two middle incisors were\r\nthen called _duales_; the lateral incisors were called _quadrupli_,\r\nbecause, together with the middle ones, they formed a series of four\r\nteeth. Guy gives the name of _caysales_ (_caisseaux_) to the last two\r\nmolars; but Joubert, one of the translators and commentators of Guy de\r\nChauliac, tells us that the molars in general were called in Languedoc\r\n_caisseaux_: “Les cinq molaires sont appelées en Languedoc _caisseaux_,\r\nparce qu’elles servent à casser les choses dures, comme les noix et\r\nsemblables.” In regard to the canines of the upper jaw, we learn that\r\nthey were called _oeillères_ (eye teeth), because their root was\r\nbelieved to reach near the eye.[235]\r\n\r\nAccording to Guy de Chauliac, _les dents sont engendrées non\r\nseulement en l’enfance, ains aux autres ages_.[236] And this passage\r\nwas commented by Joubert in the following note, which we reproduce\r\ntextually:\r\n\r\n“En Languedoc, près de Pezenas y a une gentil femme, nommé Mademoiselle\r\nde Lobatiere, dès long temps vieille édentée, à laquelle (comme\r\ntesmoignent beaucoup de gens très-dignes de foy) environ l’an 70 de\r\nson age, sont sorties cinq ou six dents nouvelles. Le conciliateur\r\ntesmoigne avoir veu, à qui les dents perdues devant l’an 60 ont été\r\nderechef engendrées, moindre toutes fois que les premieres et plus\r\nfoibles.”[237] (In Languedoc, near Pezenas, there is a lady named\r\nMademoiselle de Lobatiere, who having been for a long time old and\r\ntoothless (according to the testimony of persons well worthy of\r\nbelief), at about the age of seventy got five or six new teeth. The\r\nConciliator[238] testifies to having seen teeth grow anew—smaller,\r\nhowever, and weaker than the first—in persons who had lost them before\r\nthe age of sixty years).\r\n\r\nIn regard to the pathology and therapy of the teeth, Guy but rarely\r\nabandons the footsteps of the Arabian writers. Following the example\r\nof one of these, Ali Abbas, he admits five or six dental maladies:\r\npain, corrosion, congelation, and _agacement_ (teeth set on edge),\r\nlimosity or fetidness, fall or loosening.[239] As to the cure, this is\r\ndivided into universal and particular. The former includes, before all,\r\nhygienic rules, and then purgatives, bloodletting of the cephalic vein\r\nor the veins of the lips or tongue, revulsion, obtained by means of\r\ncupping glasses, friction, etc., and the remedies for curing the rheums\r\nof the head, or for throwing out the phlegmatic humors (pyrethrum,\r\nmastic, and the like).\r\n\r\nThe hygienic rules are the following: Not to eat food apt to putrefy,\r\nsuch as fish and milk foods; to avoid food or drink either too hot or\r\ntoo cold, and especially the rapid succession of cold and hot, or _vice\r\nversa_; not to bite hard things, nor to eat viscous food, such as figs\r\nand confectionery made with honey; to avoid certain foods which are\r\nknown to be bad for the teeth, such as leeks; not to clean the teeth\r\ntoo roughly, but to rub them with honey and burnt salt, to which, very\r\nadvantageously, may be added some vinegar.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the special methods of cure of single dental\r\naffections, Guy observes that operations on the teeth are _particular_\r\n(proper) to barbers and to “dentatores,”[240] to whom doctors have\r\nabandoned them. But it is safest of all, says he, to have such\r\noperations performed under the direction of doctors. These, however,\r\nto be in a position to give advice in regard to diseases of the\r\nteeth, must know the various methods of cure which are suited to\r\nthese diseases, that is to say, mouth washes, gargles, masticatories,\r\nfillings, evaporations, anointments, rubbings, fumigations,\r\ncauterizations, sternutatories, instillations into the ears, and manual\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nLastly, Guy notes that the “_dentator_”[241] must be provided with all\r\nthe appropriate instruments, that is, with “rasoirs, rapes, spatumes,\r\ndroits et courbes, eslevatoires simples et à deux branches, tenailles\r\ndentelées, et diverses esprouvettes, cannules, deschaussoirs, tarieres,\r\naussi des limes, et plusieurs autres necessaires a cette besogne” (in\r\nLatin: rasoriis, raspatoriis, et spatuminibus rectis et curvis, et\r\nlevatoriis simplicibus et cum duobus ramis, tenaculis dentatis, et\r\nprobis diversis, cannulis, scalpis et terebellis, et etiam limis.)[242]\r\n\r\nWhilst Abulcasis bitterly declaims against the barbers, because they,\r\nin spite of their ignorance, permit themselves to perform operations\r\non the teeth, and especially to extract them, Guy de Chauliac speaks\r\nin quite a different tone. He recognizes that such operations are\r\n_particular_, which is as much as to say, in modern language, that the\r\npractice of dental surgery constitutes a _specialty_. Guy, it is true,\r\nexpresses his desire that dental operations be performed, for greater\r\nsecurity, under the direction of doctors, but he does not use one word\r\nof blame or contempt against the _dentatores_, thus leaving it to be\r\nunderstood that, according to him, their art had every good reason\r\nto exist. Besides, from the enumeration of the surgical instruments\r\nwhich Guy says are necessary to them, we can easily argue that the\r\n_dentatores_ of the fourteenth century were not, as at the very first\r\none might be led to believe, mere “tooth-pullers,” but that, at least,\r\nthe best among them cured teeth as well as the scanty knowledge and\r\nmeans of cure then available enabled them to do.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on odontalgia,[243] Guy de Chauliac distinguishes\r\nbetween the pains, the point of departure of which is in the tooth\r\nitself, and those resulting from disease in other parts, for example,\r\nfrom apostema[244] of the gums; in these latter cases, in order to\r\ncause the pain to cease, it is necessary to cure the part from which\r\nthe pain is derived, taking into account the nature of the disease and\r\nits causes.\r\n\r\nWhen the pain is situated in the root of the tooth or in its nerve, it\r\nis necessary, says the author, to distinguish whether it is caused by\r\nan accumulation of morbid matter, or whether it is, instead, a simple\r\npain _without matter_. Besides, it is necessary to distinguish, in the\r\nfirst case, whether the matter producing the pain is hot, cold, or\r\nwindy; and also, in the second case, it is necessary to ascertain if\r\nthe pain is of a warm, cold, dry, or humid nature. As may be seen, the\r\nprinciples and subtle distinctions of the pneumatic school were then in\r\nfull vigor.\r\n\r\nThe treatment must vary according to all the aforesaid cases; but the\r\nmeans of cure advised by Guy de Chauliac do not present any special\r\ninterest, as they are almost entirely taken from Galen and from the\r\nArabian authors, and especially from Rhazes, Ali Abbas, and Avicenna.\r\n\r\nOn coming to speak of the looseness of teeth,[245] Guy says that\r\nthis may depend on various causes: that is, on a fall or a blow; on\r\nhumidity, which softens the nerve and ligament;[246] on dryness and\r\nlack of nourishment of the teeth; and lastly, on corrosion of the gums.\r\n\r\nThe looseness of teeth, which depends on dryness or want of nutrition,\r\nas in the old and in consumptive people, is incurable. In other kinds\r\nof looseness, astringents are useful; but it is also well that the\r\npatient should speak but little, that he should not touch or move the\r\nloose tooth, nor use it in masticating. In cases of corrosion of the\r\ngums, this disease must be cured.\r\n\r\nIf looseness of the teeth follows a blow, it is well, first of all, to\r\nlet blood, and then to use astringents and excitants. When all this is\r\nof no avail, Guy advises that the loose teeth be tied to the healthy\r\nones with a little gold chain,[247] after the manner of Abulcasis. And\r\nif, says he, the teeth fall out, they may be replaced with teeth of\r\nanother person, or with artificial teeth of ox bone, fixing them in\r\ntheir place with a fine ligature; and, he adds, that such teeth are\r\nserviceable for a long time. Here are the precise words of the text:\r\n“Et si les dents tombent, qu’on y mette des dents d’un autre, ou qu’on\r\nen forge d’os de vache, et soient lisez finement, et on s’en sert\r\nlong-temps.”\r\n\r\nThis extremely concise manner of treating dental prosthesis, summing\r\nall up in some thirty words, is in strong contrast with the usual\r\nfulness of explanation and methodical accuracy of Guy de Chauliac, to\r\nwhom, very justly, could be given the title of founder of didactical\r\nsurgery. Such a strange contrast cannot be explained, unless by\r\nadmitting that Guy considered dental prosthesis as foreign to the\r\ngeneral plan of his book, that is, as something which did not directly\r\nconcern surgeons, and for which, therefore, a mere allusion ought to\r\nbe sufficient. Without the slightest doubt, dental prosthesis was\r\npractised neither by doctors nor surgeons, but by the _dentatores_.\r\n\r\nAbulcasis, too, certainly for the same reason, is extremely brief\r\nin speaking of artificial teeth, but, on the other hand, he very\r\nminutely describes the process of ligating loose teeth. Guy omits this\r\ndescription entirely, and only alludes briefly to this therapeutic\r\npractice. From this it is easy to perceive that whilst Abulcasis\r\nconsidered this operation within the province of surgeons, Guy de\r\nChauliac was disposed to exclude it from the field of general surgery,\r\nconsidering that this, too, like the other dental operations, belonged\r\nto the _dentatores_. In his days, in short, dentistry had become much\r\nmore clearly specialized than it was in the days of Abulcasis.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the looseness of teeth, Guy de Chauliac goes on\r\nto treat of caries, in a short chapter, entitled “De la Pourriture, des\r\nvers, de corrosion et pertuifement des dents.”\r\n\r\nThe method of cure, he says, is double, viz., universal and particular.\r\nThe general treatment embraces the hygienic and therapeutic means\r\nalready mentioned. As to the particular or local treatment, it\r\nconsists, first of all, in washing the teeth with aqua vitæ or with a\r\nvinous decoction of mint, salvia, melissa, pepper, or pyrethrum. Then\r\nit is necessary to fill the carious cavity with gallia[248] and root of\r\ncyperus,[249] mastich, myrrh, sulphur, and camphor, wax, ammoniacum,\r\nasafetida and the like. As may be seen, Guy does no more than mention\r\nthe substances used in his days for the filling of carious teeth, and\r\ndoes not tell us what various combinations were formed with the said\r\nmaterials, nor the proportions in which they were used. In short, he\r\ndoes not give us any formula for the composition of a filling mass, and\r\nfrom this may be inferred, without fear of error, that this operation\r\nalso was never performed by him, consequently it, too, was not\r\npractised by doctors and surgeons, but rather by the _dentatores_.\r\n\r\nWhen the aforesaid means of cure—that is, the mouth washes and the\r\nfilling—are of no use, Guy advises the margins of the carious cavity\r\nbeing taken away with a scalpel and file, so that alimentary substances\r\nmay not be retained inside it. However, here are his words, which seem\r\nespecially to refer to cases of interstitial caries:\r\n\r\n“Si ces choses n’y valent rien, la dent soit esbuschaillee avec un\r\nciseau et lime,[250] e qu’on luy fasse un passage, à ce que la viande\r\nne s’arreste au trou.” If advantage is not even derived from such an\r\noperation, recourse must be had to cauterization, or, if necessary, to\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nEven Guy de Chauliac believes in the worms of the teeth, and against\r\nthese he recommends the usual fumigations. He advises that the seeds\r\nof leek, onion, and hyoscyamus be mixed with goat’s tallow and made\r\ninto pills of a dram each in weight, one of which is to be used for\r\neach fumigation: “Si dans le trou il y a un ver, apres le susdit\r\nlavement,[251] la dent soit suffumiguée avec une graine de porreau et\r\nd’oignon et semence d’hyosciame, confits avec suif de bouc; et qu’on\r\nen fasse des pilules chacune d’une drachme et qu’on y en employe une à\r\nchaque fois.”\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter Guy treats “De la limosite et laide couleur\r\ndes dents.” Here, too, he recommends, before all, the general hygienic\r\nrules above mentioned. Besides, he advises the mouth being rinsed with\r\na vinous decoction of wild mint and of pepper, and then the use of the\r\nfollowing dentifrice:\r\n\r\n“℞—_Cuttle-bone, small white seashells, pumice stone, burnt stag’s\r\nhorn, nitre, alum, rock salt, burnt roots of iris, aristolochia, and\r\nreeds._ All these substances must be reduced to powder together, or\r\neach one separately.” Use may also be made of a liquid dentifrice thus\r\nprepared:\r\n\r\n“℞—_Sal ammoniac and rock salt, half a pound of each; saccharine\r\nalum, one-quarter of a pound._ These to be reduced to a powder and\r\nplaced in an alembic of glass, so as to obtain a liquid, with which the\r\nteeth must be rubbed by means of a little scarlet cloth.”\r\n\r\nIf these means of cure are of no avail, on account of the presence of\r\nhardened limosity (tartar), this must be removed by scraping it away\r\nwith appropriate instruments. “Et si cela ne profite, à cause qu’il\r\ny a là des limosites endurcies; soient rasclées avec des rapes et\r\nspatumes.”[252]\r\n\r\nAgainst the setting of teeth on edge (_endormement et congelation des\r\ndents_; _stupor et congelatio dentium_), Guy de Chauliac recommends\r\nhot wine or aqua vitæ, to be kept in the mouth; or the teeth to be\r\nrubbed with roasted salt; or the application to them of hot roasted\r\nwalnuts and filberts and similar things which convey heat; or lastly,\r\nmasticating substances, which possess heating properties, such as the\r\nportulaca (purslane) and its seeds.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the extraction of teeth and of dental roots is a simple\r\nsummary of what Abulcasis says on this subject; some passages of this\r\nauthor are copied word for word.\r\n\r\nWhilst the Arabian surgeon treats rather lengthily of the deformities\r\nof the dental arches, and the methods to be employed in correcting\r\nthese, Guy de Chauliac almost entirely neglects this subject and\r\nlimits himself to saying that if any tooth has become abnormally\r\nlengthened, it is necessary to reduce it to the right length with the\r\nfile, but operating “wisely,” so as not to loosen it:\r\n\r\n“S’il y a quelque dent augmentée outre nature, soit egalisée et\r\napplanie sagement avec la lime, que ne soit ébranlée.”\r\n\r\nGuy strongly throws doubt upon the efficacy of supposed eradicating\r\nremedies. In regard to this he says: “The ancients mention many\r\nmedicaments, which draw out the teeth without iron instruments or\r\nwhich make them more easy to draw out; such as the milky juice of the\r\ntithymal with pyrethrum, the roots of the mulberry and caper, citrine\r\narsenic, aqua fortis, the fat of forest frogs. But these remedies\r\npromise much and operate but little—_mais ils donnent beaucoup de\r\npromesses, et peu d’operations_.”\r\n\r\nFrom the book of Guy de Chauliac we can gather a very important fact,\r\nwhich is worth mentioning here; that is to say, that some surgeons of\r\nthat period made use already of anesthetic inhalations, especially for\r\namputations. Here is what Guy says:[253]\r\n\r\n“Some prescribe medicaments which send the patient to sleep, so\r\nthat the incision may not be felt, such as opium, the juice of the\r\nmorel,[254] hyoscyamus, mandrake, ivy, hemlock, lettuce. A new sponge\r\nis soaked by them in these juices and left to dry in the sun; and when\r\nthey have need of it they put this sponge into warm water and then hold\r\nit under the nostrils of the patient until he goes to sleep. Then they\r\nperform the operation.”\r\n\r\nIt seems that the narcosis thus obtained was sufficiently intense,\r\nsince Guy also speaks of the means used to awaken the patient. These\r\nconsisted in applying another sponge, soaked in vinegar, under the\r\nnose, or in dropping into the nostrils and ears the juice of rue or\r\nfennel.\r\n\r\nGuy lets us know that other surgeons made the patients go to sleep by\r\ngiving them opium to drink; but he decidedly disapproves of such a\r\npractice, as he has heard of patients who through this have died.\r\n\r\nVALESCUS OF TARANTA (called by the French authors Valescon or Balescon\r\nde Tarente or Tharare), professor at the University of Montpellier\r\nat the beginning of the fifteenth century, wrote a valuable treatise\r\non medicine and surgery, entitled _Philonium pharmaceuticum et\r\nchirurgicum, de medendis omnibus humani corporis affectibus_. As to\r\nthe diseases of the teeth, he especially follows Guy de Chauliac, but\r\ntreats the subject at greater length, profiting by what has been\r\nwritten on the subject by all the ancient writers, and especially the\r\nArabians.\r\n\r\nAmong the many remedies which he recommends against toothache, here are\r\nsome:\r\n\r\n“℞—Wild mint, pyrethrum, white pepper, myrrh, two drams of each; let\r\nthese be pulverized and made into a paste with the pulp of raisins or\r\nwith white wax and with some turpentine; and let this mass be divided\r\ninto small balls as large as filberts, of which one must be masticated\r\nat a time, with the aching teeth.”[255]\r\n\r\nAnother masticatory is composed of origanum, pyrethrum, cinnamon, and\r\nginger, made into a paste with the yolk of an egg cooked under the\r\ncoals.\r\n\r\nTo calm dental pains, the vapors of a decoction of wild lavender,\r\nmarjoram, rue, chamelea, and melilot are often efficacious. As to\r\nfumigations, they can be made not only with vegetable substances (onion\r\nor mustard seed, rue, etc.), but also by burning scrapings of the hoof\r\nof an ass. The fumes may be made to reach the aching tooth, by means of\r\na funnel. Here are the words of the author: “Fiant suffitus ex rasura\r\nungulæ asini, et fumus recipiatur per infundibulum.”\r\n\r\nDecayed teeth may be filled, according to Valescus, to satisfy four\r\ndifferent indications: To calm or prevent pain, to prevent any further\r\nspreading of the caries, to kill the worms, and to sweeten the breath.\r\nHe advises that the carious cavities should be filled up with powdered\r\nnigella, pepper, myrrh, salt, and theriac; or else with pyrethrum, gum\r\nammoniac, and opium; or else with celery seeds pulverized, opium, and\r\nhyoscyamus; or with the cast-off skin of serpents boiled in vinegar;\r\nor with gallia and cyperus. The filling with these last two substances\r\nare especially suitable, according to the author, to preserve the teeth\r\nfrom further spreading of the caries: “Si gallia et cyperus cavis\r\ndentibus applicentur, dentes ulterius non corrodentur.”\r\n\r\nTo kill the supposed worms of the teeth, Valescus counsels three\r\ndifferent methods, of which the first consists of the usual fumigations\r\nwith seeds of hyoscyamus, onion, leek, coloquintida; the second\r\nconsists in filling the carious cavity with a mixture of myrrh and\r\naloes; and lastly, the third, in applying inside the cavity the milky\r\njuice of the tithymal, or the juice of the persicaria.[256]\r\n\r\nIn regard to tartar of the teeth—which he calls _materia lapidea_,\r\n_i. e._, stony substance—Valescus says that it must be removed little\r\nby little, either with iron instruments or with dentifrices partly\r\ncleansing and partly styptic. After the tartar has been removed, it is\r\nnecessary to wash the teeth often with white wine and to rub them with\r\nroasted salt.[257]\r\n\r\nValescus, too, like the majority of ancient writers, is not at all\r\nfavorable to the extraction of teeth. He says that recourse must not be\r\nhad to this operation except when a tooth is the cause of most violent\r\npain and every remedy has been of no avail. But the reasons which he\r\ngives in support of this opinion are very plausible; and whilst most of\r\nthe authors who preceded him showed themselves adverse to extraction,\r\nbecause they considered it dangerous, he does not allude in the least\r\nto such dangers, but wishes extraction to be avoided, if possible,\r\n“because the teeth, even when they are in some parts corroded, yet\r\nnevertheless, after the pain is calmed, aid mastication and besides\r\nrender the others firmer.”[258]\r\n\r\nThis author agrees with Galen in considering the teeth as bones, but\r\nhe is of opinion that they differ from the other bones in more than\r\none respect; that is, first of all, on account of their sensibility;\r\nsecondly, because, whilst the other bones are formed in the uterus, the\r\nteeth are formed outside the uterus; and lastly, for a reason which\r\ncannot but appear very strange to us, that is: “The bones are produced\r\nby the sperm and menstrual blood, whilst the teeth are produced by the\r\nblood in which there has remained the virtue of the sperm.”[259] This\r\npassage gives us an idea of the state of embryological knowledge of\r\nthose days!\r\n\r\nPIETRO OF ARGELATA (or of La Cerlata), professor of surgery at Bologna\r\n(died in 1433), wrote a treatise on surgery in six books, in which\r\ndiseases of the teeth are also taken into serious consideration. He\r\nspeaks of a great number of dental instruments, which, however, are\r\nthe same as those enumerated by Guy de Chauliac. His methods of cure\r\ndo not offer anything very new, being for the most part identical with\r\nthose of Avicenna and Abulcasis. He considers cleanliness of the teeth\r\nof the greatest importance; shows what great injury is done by dental\r\ntartar—which by him is considered a very important sign of the bad\r\nstate of the teeth—he counsels the removal of it by means of scrapers,\r\nfiles, or the use of strong dentifrice powders; and to make the teeth\r\nwhite, he even advises the use of aqua fortis.\r\n\r\nHe says nothing in regard to the filling of decayed teeth; he, however,\r\ncounsels the cleansing of the carious cavities with aqua fortis, or\r\neven, in some cases, the widening of them, in order to render them\r\nshallower and therefore less liable to retain alimentary residues.\r\n\r\nPietro of Argelata cured dental fistulas by means of caustics and\r\narsenic. He counselled simple palliative means of cure for hard\r\nepulides of a cancerous nature. In regard to soft, benignant epulides,\r\nhe was little favorable to excision, as this might cause hemorrhage;\r\nhe preferred ligating the tumor; or he repeatedly cauterized it with\r\nboiling oil or other caustics, until he caused it to fall.[260]\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMEO MONTAGNANA, who taught surgery in the University of Padua\r\nand died in 1460, recommended, as an excellent anti-odontalgic remedy,\r\na mixture of camphor and opium. In his days, faith in the pretended\r\neradicating virtues of certain substances was being gradually lost;\r\nbut, on the other hand, a tendency now arose to neglect, in regard\r\nto the teeth, the conservative principle, to which the ancients had\r\nheld so jealously; and little by little the extraction of a tooth\r\nbegan to be considered an operation of small or no importance, that\r\ncould be performed with the greatest indifference. Montagnana himself\r\nconsiders the extraction of a tooth as the best means of curing\r\nodontalgia, whilst the ancients did not have recourse to it, saving as\r\na last resource. Notwithstanding this, if the caries was not deep, he\r\npreferred to extraction the use of caustics and a red-hot iron.[261]\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI PLATEARIO, a professor at Pisa in the latter half of the\r\nfifteenth century, cauterized carious teeth with a small piece of\r\nkindled ash wood, or with a red-hot iron, and held that cauterization\r\nwas more effectual when, before performing it, the carious hollow had\r\nbeen filled up with theriac.[262]\r\n\r\nHe, too, made the administration of purgatives or bloodletting precede\r\nthe extraction of a tooth. Plateario has, however, the merit of having\r\nintroduced the sitting position for operations on the teeth, whilst\r\npreceding surgeons made the patient lie in a horizontal position, or\r\nheld his head steady between their knees, as may be read in Abulcasis\r\nand in other writers. Besides, he recommends taking care, when the\r\nextraction of a tooth had to be performed, that the surrounding air\r\nshould be pure; perhaps because he thought that when operating in\r\na place where the air was tainted, complications might more easily\r\narise, on account of contagious substances reaching the inside of the\r\nwound; or perhaps because he judged, not without reason, that certain\r\naccidents, such as syncope, could more easily happen, and were more\r\ndangerous in a tainted atmosphere than in the midst of pure, vivifying\r\nair. After the operation, he prescribed astringent mouth washes.\r\nAgainst dental worms, whose existence no one at that period doubted\r\nin the least, Plateario recommended various remedies, chiefly under\r\nthe form of fumigations; and among these latter, those performed with\r\nburnt opium. Against ulcerations of the gums and mouth he commended\r\nthe use of wine and aromatic substances. An excellent remedy was also,\r\naccording to him, lime dissolved in very strong hot vinegar, and\r\nmixed, after complete evaporation of the liquid, with a fourth part of\r\norpiment.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI OF ARCOLI (in Latin, _Joannes Arculanus_), professor at\r\nBologna and afterward at Padua (who died in 1484), wrote a commentary\r\non a celebrated book of medicine, which Rhazes had dedicated to the\r\nglorious King Almansor, great patron of science and art.[263]\r\n\r\nIn this most valuable work of Arculanus there are several chapters\r\nrelative to diseases of the teeth; and this subject is treated rather\r\nfully and with great accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe author, first of all, treats of the anatomy and physiology of the\r\nteeth; he, however, falls into many errors, for instance, in regard to\r\nthe number of dental roots. (“The first six teeth of the upper jaw have\r\nonly one root; the first six of the lower not more than two; the molars\r\nof the upper jaw have three; those of the lower generally only two in\r\nlike manner; the _neguezid_[264] of the upper jaw have four roots, but\r\nthe two lower neguezid have only three.”)\r\n\r\nAccording to him there is not the least doubt that the teeth grow\r\nduring the whole lifetime, thus repairing the continual waste caused\r\nby use; and among other proofs he adduces that, whilst in the old all\r\nother organs shrink and waste away through lack of nourishment, the\r\nteeth, on the contrary, show very frequently an increase in length.\r\n\r\nFor the preservation of teeth—considered by him, quite rightly, a\r\nmatter of great importance—Giovanni of Arcoli repeats the various\r\ncounsels given on the subject by preceding writers, but he gives\r\nthem as ten distinct canons or rules, creating in this way a kind of\r\ndecalogue of dental hygiene. These rules are: (1) It is necessary to\r\nguard against the corruption of food and drink within the stomach;\r\ntherefore, easily corruptible food—milk, salt fish, etc.—must not be\r\npartaken of, and after meals all excessive movement, coition, bathing,\r\nand other causes that impair the digestion, must also be avoided. (2)\r\nEverything must be avoided that may provoke vomiting. (3) Sweet and\r\nviscous food—such as dried figs, preserves made with honey, etc.—must\r\nnot be partaken of. (4) Hard things must not be broken with the teeth.\r\n(5) All food, drink, and other substances that can set the teeth on\r\nedge must be avoided. (6) Food that is too hot or too cold must be\r\navoided, and especially the rapid succession of hot and cold, and _vice\r\nversa_. (7) Leeks must not be eaten, as such a food, by its own nature,\r\nis injurious to the teeth. (8) The teeth must be cleaned, at once,\r\nafter every meal, from the particles of food left in them; and for this\r\npurpose must be used thin pieces of wood somewhat broad at the ends,\r\nbut not sharp pointed or edged; and preference should be given to small\r\ncypress twigs, to the wood of aloes, of pine, rosemary, of juniper, and\r\nsimilar sorts of wood which are rather bitter and styptic; care must,\r\nhowever, be taken not to search too long in the dental interstices\r\nand not to injure the gums or shake the teeth. (9) After this, it is\r\nnecessary to rinse the mouth, using by preference a vinous decoction\r\nof sage, or one of cinnamon, mastich, gallia, moschata, cubeb, juniper\r\nseeds, root of cyperus, and rosemary leaves. (10) The teeth must be\r\nrubbed with suitable dentifrices before going to bed, or else in the\r\nmorning before breakfast. Although Avicenna recommended various oils\r\nfor this purpose, Giovanni of Arcoli appears very hostile to oleaginous\r\nfrictions, because he considers them very injurious to the stomach. He\r\nobserves, besides, that whilst moderate frictions of brief duration\r\nare helpful to the teeth, strengthen the gums, prevent the formation\r\nof tartar, and sweeten the breath, too rough or too prolonged rubbing\r\nis, on the contrary, harmful to the teeth and makes them liable to\r\nmany diseases. As a dentifrice, he recommends a mixture of two parts\r\nof honey to one of the best sugar; or the ashes of the burnt head of a\r\nhare; or burnt salt made into an electuary by the addition of honey.\r\nTo use the last two dentifrices, a quantity about equal in volume to\r\na filbert must be wrapped and tied inside a thin, loosely woven piece\r\nof linen cloth, and with this the teeth must then be rubbed. Finally,\r\ntheriac, too, is considered by him a very good dentifrice. According to\r\nArculanus, dental pains are sometimes situated in the very substance of\r\nthe tooth, at other times in the nerve, and at others in the gums.\r\n\r\nThe dental substance may become painful, owing to bad “complexion”\r\n(viz., constitution), without there being any morbid matter in it.\r\nWhen, however, such matter exists, it may proceed from the head or\r\nfrom the stomach, and in certain cases it gives rise to an apostema of\r\nthe tooth; in other cases it corrodes the latter; and at other times\r\ngenerates (!) in it a worm, which in its turn corrodes the tooth.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the diagnosis of dental pains, it is necessary first\r\nof all to examine the state of the gums, that is to say, to observe\r\nwhether these, in the aching spot, appear healthy, or whether, on the\r\ncontrary, they are discolored or tumid, sanguinolent, suppurating, or\r\nthe seat of corrosion or putrefaction, or if, when pressure is put\r\nupon them, an exit of matter is produced. In such cases it may be\r\nconsidered that the gums are the seat of the pain. But if none of these\r\nsymptoms are observed, and if, on comparing the gums of the aching spot\r\nwith the other gingival regions, no difference is observed, this means\r\nthat the cause of the pain exists either in the substance of the tooth\r\nitself, or else in its nerve. In this latter case the pain is usually\r\nvery violent, and principally localized in the root of the tooth, but\r\nalso extending along the jaw, and the tooth itself is often, as it\r\nwere, benumbed. When, however, the pain is not situated either in the\r\ngums or in the dental nerve, but in the very substance of the tooth,\r\nthis latter is very often corroded (carious), and very often in the\r\nhollow there exists a worm; and this may be deduced from the fact that\r\nduring the intervals of calm the patient sometimes feels a peculiar\r\nsensation, the movement of the worm in the diseased tooth; when,\r\nhowever, these signs are wanting, we shall find at any rate that the\r\nwhole tooth is painful in the direction of its length, instead of the\r\npain being localized in the root of the tooth and radiating along the\r\njaw.\r\n\r\nWhen the cause of the pain resides in the gums the extraction of the\r\ntooth is neither necessary nor beneficial, but is, on the contrary,\r\nalways harmful, since, in spite of the loss of the tooth, the cessation\r\nof the pain is not obtained; when the pain is situated in the tooth\r\nitself, the removal of the latter always makes the pain cease; lastly,\r\nwhen the dental nerve is the seat of the evil, the removal of the tooth\r\nsometimes takes away the pain, at other times it does not.\r\n\r\nAmong the many anti-odontalgic remedies, Arculanus enumerates pepper\r\nmixed with tar, pepper with asafetida, mustard seeds with asafetida,\r\nand the like. When a tooth is to be cauterized, it is necessary to\r\nprotect the healthy teeth with bits of cloth dipped in rose water or\r\nelse with some kind of paste. Sometimes it is useful to drill the tooth\r\nwith a small trephine so that the cautery may act more deeply, thus\r\ngiving better results.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the filling of decayed teeth, Giovanni of Arcoli says\r\nthat, in the choice of the substances to be used, the _complexion_\r\n(constitution) of the teeth must be taken into consideration; and\r\naccording as this is cold or warm, it is necessary to perform the\r\nfilling with substances which are, by their own nature, warm or cold,\r\nthus acting in opposition to the dyscrasia of the tooth:\r\n\r\n“_Eligantur calida aut frigida secundum opportunitatem, in contrarium\r\ndyscrasiæ dentis._”\r\n\r\nAs to the quality of the complexion, this might be deduced, says the\r\nauthor, from various signs, among which the color of the gums, these\r\nbeing red in the warm and humid complexion, yellowish in the warm and\r\ndry, brownish in the cold and dry, and whitish in the cold and humid\r\ncomplexion. When, however, the complexion does not show any distinct\r\ncharacteristic, and varies but little from the average, Arculanus\r\nadvises the teeth being filled with gold-leaf: “_Ubi non fuerit multus\r\nrecessus a mediocritate, impleatur cum foliis auri._”\r\n\r\nAlthough Arculanus is the first writer who alludes to the filling of\r\nteeth with gold, nevertheless it is by no means admissible that he was\r\nhimself the inventor of gold filling. His words do not at all sound\r\nto us as the announcement of a new discovery, as the enunciation of a\r\nnew fact, in which the author himself had had, at least, a part, be\r\nit great or small. Nothing of all this; the advice as to filling the\r\nteeth, in certain cases, with gold leaf is given quite impersonally,\r\nand is found, as if it were a point of minor importance, at the end\r\nof a long paragraph, which includes various other counsels in regard\r\nto the filling of teeth, one of which is, that this operation should\r\nnot be performed with too great violence.[265] In short, the writer\r\ndoes not show the least intention of putting in evidence the aforesaid\r\nfact, or of giving to it any special importance. We must, therefore,\r\nhold that gold filling had already been in use for a long time among\r\ndentists, and that Arculanus simply mentions what was done by the\r\ndentists of those days. (See note page 164.) It is evident, on the\r\nother hand, that he had no special competence in dental art, when we\r\nconsider that he was even ignorant of the exact number of dental roots.\r\nNaturally, the question here arises: At what period did gold begin to\r\nbe used for the filling of teeth? But unfortunately history has not,\r\nup to the present, furnished us any evidence which may lead to the\r\nsolution of this problem.\r\n\r\nFor the eradication of a tooth Arculanus gives three very precise\r\nindications: (1) When the pain resists every other means of cure. (2)\r\nWhen there is any danger of the disease spreading to the neighboring\r\nhealthy teeth. (3) When the tooth is troublesome in speaking and in\r\nmasticating.\r\n\r\nBefore extraction, the patient must be prepared for it by bloodletting,\r\npurgatives, and narcotics; and the operation must be commenced by\r\nseparating the gums from the tooth.\r\n\r\nArculanus admits, like many of his predecessors, that the eradication\r\nof a tooth may be effected not only by the forceps and other suitable\r\ninstruments, but also by other means. One of these would be the use of\r\nthe actual cautery, repeatedly applied inside the hollow of the tooth,\r\nif this is decayed; or, in the contrary case, made to act all around\r\nits root (neck). The fall of the tooth might also be obtained with\r\npotential cauteries and especially by the application of boiling oil,\r\nor of a grain of incense heated to the melting point.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that Giovanni of Arcoli has simply copied these things\r\nfrom preceding authors, since if he had made a trial of the pretended\r\neradicating means, he would soon have verified their inefficiency.\r\n\r\nAgainst hemorrhage of the gums, Arculanus recommends arsenic, lime,\r\ngall-nuts, alum, and oil of roses. But, says he, the surest remedy is\r\nthe red-hot iron; and still more effectual, cauterization by means of\r\nred-hot gold.\r\n\r\nGiovanni of Arcoli’s work is not only noteworthy because it mentions\r\ngold filling for the first time, but also because in it are given the\r\ndrawings of three dental instruments, among which the pelican (here\r\ncalled _pulicanum_). According to Carabelli, the first author who has\r\nmentioned the pelican was the Dutchman Peter Foreest; according to\r\nGeist-Jacobi, instead, it was the German Walter Ryff. But both these\r\nstatements are false, because as we have just now said, the pelican\r\nwas already named and designed (not very well, it is true) in the book\r\nof the Italian Giovanni of Arcoli, who died in 1484, that is, even\r\nbefore either Walter Ryff or Peter Foreest came into the world. Neither\r\ndoes Giovanni of Arcoli say one word that might imply that he was the\r\ninventor of the pelican, and so we are led to believe that in his days\r\nthis instrument had already been in use for some time. In the text he\r\nonly says: “The teeth are to be extracted with suitable instruments,\r\nwhose figures may be seen in the margin.”[266]\r\n\r\nWe here reproduce the three figures alluded to, with the relative\r\nindications. The first (Fig. 56) represents the pelican; the second\r\n(Fig. 57) is a pair of curved forceps, which seems, in those days,\r\nto have been the instrument most commonly used for the extraction of\r\nteeth, since this figure is accompanied by the very generic indication\r\n“shape of the forceps for extracting teeth;” finally, the third (Fig.\r\n58) represents the forceps used for extracting dental fragments\r\n(roots), and which from the long and straight shape of its jaws, was\r\ncalled “stork’s bill” (rostrum ciconiæ).\r\n\r\nALESSANDRO BENEDETTI, of Verona, who lived from 1460 to 1525, and\r\ntaught medicine at Padua, was, for his times, a man of uncommon\r\nscientific merit; but to the development of the dental art he did not\r\ncontribute anything very worthy of note.\r\n\r\nHe relates that he once abstained from buying a slave simply because\r\nthe teeth of the latter were like those of wild beasts, a thing which\r\nhe considered as a bad omen.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, toothache is a disease proper to man, no other animal\r\nbeing liable to it.\r\n\r\nTo keep free from odontalgia, there is, says he, a very simple means,\r\nwhich consists in rubbing the teeth once a year with the blood of a\r\ntortoise.\r\n\r\nThis is the first writer who has noted the harmful effect which mercury\r\nhas on the gums and teeth, whether this remedy be used internally or\r\nexternally, that is, by friction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56\r\n\r\nThe pelican as represented in Giovanni d’Arcoli’s work. Forceps pro\r\nextrahendis dentibus pulicanum dicta.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57\r\n\r\nDental forceps (Giovanni d’Arcoli.) Forcipum pro extrahendis dentibus\r\nforma.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58\r\n\r\nThe forceps called “stork’s bill,” as represented in Giovanni\r\nd’Arcoli’s work. Forceps pro extrahendis fragmentis quod Rostrum\r\nCiconiæ dicent.]\r\n\r\nBenedetti recommends that before proceeding to the extraction of a\r\ntooth an accurate diagnosis should be made, so that it may not happen\r\nthat, by mistaking for true odontalgia a pain localized in the gums\r\nor in the jaw, a sound tooth be drawn, under the belief that it is\r\nthe cause of the pain; for, this happening, not only would the pain\r\ncontinue, but there would be, in addition, the loss of a sound tooth,\r\nand also the disadvantage of the neighboring ones becoming less firm,\r\nfor want of support.\r\n\r\nThis author, too, attributes great importance to dental worms,\r\nbelieving them to be one of the principal and most frequent causes\r\nof odontalgia. To kill them he recommends the usual fumigations and\r\nseveral other remedies, among which the juice of the leaves of the\r\ncentaury or of the peach tree, but especially applications of aqua vitæ.\r\n\r\nWhen it is thought well to have recourse to opium to calm toothache, he\r\nadvises this to be used with the utmost prudence; and on this point, he\r\nrelates having witnessed a fatal case, in the person of a gentleman of\r\nPadua, by the incautious use of this remedy.\r\n\r\nIn extraction Benedetti repeats all the precautionary measures\r\nrecommended by the ancients, and he, too, advises that recourse should\r\nnot be had to this operation, if not as a last remedy, that is, when\r\nevery other means of cure has been found useless.[267]\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI OF VIGO. The celebrated surgeon Giovanni of Vigo (1460 to\r\n1520), speaking of abscesses of the gums,[268] says that the abscess\r\nmust be first brought to maturity by fitting remedies, if it has not\r\nripened spontaneously, then it must be opened with a lancet, and\r\nlastly, to cleanse the diseased part and to aid cicatrization, honey of\r\nroses or Egyptian ointment must be used. This latter is thus composed\r\nof: “℞—Verdigris, rock alum, _ana_ two ounces; honey of roses, one\r\nounce; plantain water and pomegranate wine, _ana_ two and one-half\r\nounces. The whole to be made to boil, and to be stirred with a small\r\nrod, until the mixture is reduced to the consistency of honey.”\r\n\r\nFor the cure of old fistulas he employs not only the above-mentioned\r\nEgyptian ointment, but also arsenic and corrosive sublimate.\r\n\r\nGiovanni of Vigo is very brief in speaking on the treatment of dental\r\ncaries, doubtless because he attributed little or no value to the\r\nnumerous methods of cure recommended by his predecessors. The treatment\r\nadvised by him is, however, very noteworthy. He says that by means of\r\na drill, file, scalpel, or other suitable instrument, it is necessary\r\nto remove the whole of the putrefied or corroded part of the teeth, and\r\nthen, to preserve it, to fill the cavity with gold leaf.\r\n\r\nThis clear and simple manner of speaking of gold filling as a cure for\r\ncaries makes us suppose that Giovanni of Vigo was not at all a stranger\r\nto the practice of dentistry, as we must think of many preceding\r\nwriters, but, on the contrary, that he was not less skilled in dental\r\noperations than he was in the other branches of surgery. Again, history\r\ntells us that Giovanni of Vigo was surgeon to the Roman court; so it\r\nwould have been strange, indeed, if the Pope, if the haughty prelates,\r\naccustomed as they were to all kinds of refinement and comfort, should\r\nhave intrusted the care of their teeth to lowborn barbers and quacks,\r\nwhilst they could dispose of the services of so eminent a surgeon.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be seen from the very book of Giovanni of Vigo,[269]\r\nthat in his days doctors and surgeons were, in general, little skilled\r\nin dental matters. Speaking of the extraction of teeth, he says: “For\r\nthis operation there is need of a practised man, and, therefore, many\r\nmedical and surgical authorities have expressed an opinion that this\r\noperation should be left to expert barbers and to the itinerant quacks\r\nwho operate in public places. He, therefore, who desires to perform\r\nthis manual operation in the best manner will derive great advantage\r\nby frequenting men who are expert in performing it and by seeing and\r\nimpressing well on his memory their manner of operating.”[270]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHIRD PERIOD—MODERN TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now arrived at the sixteenth century. The middle ages, that\r\nis, the period of transition between ancient and modern civilization,\r\nhas now come to an end. Events of the highest importance, such as the\r\ninvention of printing (1436), the taking of Constantinople by the Turks\r\n(1453), with the consequent emigration of many Greek men of letters\r\nand science, who took up their residence in the West and especially\r\nin Italy, and lastly, the discovery of America (1492), marked the\r\nbeginning of a new era, and are the most essential factors in bringing\r\nabout the revival of art and science.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the vigorous intellectual life which characterized the\r\nsixteenth century, dentistry, too, like many other branches of science,\r\nmade very notable progress; we, therefore, in this period shall have to\r\nrecord many important facts and many important names.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, in the sixteenth century, and, to be more precise, about\r\nthe year 1544, that we meet for the first time with a monograph, in\r\nwhich dental affections are spoken of independently of general medicine\r\nand surgery. The book we allude to, by WALTER HERMANN RYFF, is also\r\nnoteworthy because it is not written like the preceding works, in\r\nLatin, the customary language of the learned, but, instead, in German,\r\nthat is, in a living tongue.\r\n\r\nAs we are now mentioning the first German author on Dentistry, it may\r\nbe permitted us briefly to glance at the beginning of medicine and\r\ndental art among the German peoples.\r\n\r\nAmong the Germans, as in other nations, the first to practise the\r\nhealing art were priests, priestesses, and wise women. To cure disease\r\nthey used partly empirical remedies, and partly witchcraft and\r\nsuperstitious means of every kind. Thus, to facilitate dentition, it\r\nwas thought an excellent thing to pass a thread through the eyes of a\r\nmouse and then to tie the blood-covered thread around the neck of the\r\nchild. It was held, besides—and this prejudice has left even until now\r\nsome traces—that the putting of the milk teeth, when they fall out,\r\ninto the nest of a mouse assures the cutting of new teeth.\r\n\r\nWe must here mention, with regard to the origin of dentistry among the\r\nGermans, a very important fact related by Joseph Linderer,[271] a fact\r\nwhich shows that even among the ancient Germans recourse was had to the\r\napplication of artificial teeth.\r\n\r\nWe here reproduce the very words of the said author, translated\r\nliterally:\r\n\r\n“Being by chance a few years ago at Dresden and visiting the Museum\r\nof Antiquities, my attention was attracted, in the last room, to two\r\nosseous pieces, which with other objects were enclosed in a glass case,\r\nwith the written inscriptions: _Comb-shaped osseous pieces, found in\r\nancient German urns._ As soon as I had observed them, I saw at once\r\nthat they were artificial teeth; but as I had to be contented with\r\nexamining them through the glass of the case, it was not possible for\r\nme to decide whether these pieces were really of bone, as they seemed\r\nto be, or of another substance. Taking into account their antiquity,\r\ntheir whiteness is very notable. Every piece is composed, if I remember\r\nrightly, of five teeth, that is, of a canine and four incisors; the\r\nchief difference of these pieces from the prosthetic pieces in ivory\r\nstill in use (the author is writing in 1848) consists in this, that the\r\npieces of which I speak have not at all a broad base, designed to rest\r\non the gums, the base having instead the same thickness as the rest.\r\nThe five teeth are well separated from one another. Besides, the canine\r\nmakes the proper angle with the incisors, and at each side of the piece\r\nis found, in a convenient place, a hole, which shows that these teeth\r\nwere fastened to those of the subject by means of a metallic or other\r\nkind of thread. As the above-described pieces are white, we must infer\r\nthat they were removed from the mouth of the respective individuals\r\nbefore the body was burnt, and afterward put into the urn with the\r\nashes, just as they used to put in coins, bits of arrows, and the like.”\r\n\r\nFor many centuries dental surgery—which, however, was still in a very\r\nprimitive state—was practised in Germany, as in many other countries,\r\nprincipally by barbers. These in certain places, and at certain\r\nperiods, formed corporate bodies, whose members were legally authorized\r\nto extract teeth and to practise minor surgery in general. But besides\r\nbarbers, there were various kinds of individuals, unfurnished with\r\nany authorization—tooth-drawers, charlatans, wandering story-tellers,\r\nnecromancers, Jews, and even hangmen—who invaded the field of medical\r\npractice, in spite of its being forbidden them, except in fairs, to\r\nadminister medicaments and to perform surgical operations.[272]\r\n\r\nIn 1460 there appeared in Germany a book on Surgery by Heinrich von\r\nPfolsprundt, Knight of the Teutonic Order.[273] The author had acquired\r\ngreat experience as surgeon in the military expeditions of his order,\r\nand we see from his book that he was very skilled in the cure of wounds\r\nand fractures. On the other hand, he shows himself hostile to every\r\nbloody operation with the exception of rhinoplast. Pains of the teeth\r\nand gums were cured by him by means of beverages.[274]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Title page of Zahnarzneybuchlein.]\r\n\r\n  [The accompanying reproduction of the title page and\r\n  two text pages from an edition of _Zahnarzneybuchlein_,\r\n  printed by Michael Blum, in Leipzig, 1530, and translated\r\n  below, is of interest in connection with the history of\r\n  the use of gold-foil as a filling material, in that a\r\n  marginal note refers to Mesue as the author from whom the\r\n  three methods of treating caries has been derived, one\r\n  of these methods being the filling of the carious cavity\r\n  with gold-foil.\r\n\r\n  Mesue was Surgeon to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, who\r\n  flourished 786-809. If the reference to Mesue is correct,\r\n  it would, therefore, indicate that the filling of teeth\r\n  with gold was known to the Arabs as early as the latter\r\n  part of the eighth century. Examination of the writings\r\n  of Mesue has thus far failed to bring to light any record\r\n  therein of the treatment of caries by gold filling,\r\n  although in his work previously referred to (see page\r\n  138) the other methods quoted by the anonymous author of\r\n  _Zahnarzneybuchlein_ are fully set forth.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Latin text.]\r\n\r\n  [_Translation._]\r\n\r\n\r\n  FIFTH CHAPTER.\r\n\r\n  ON CARIOUS AND HOLLOW TEETH.\r\n\r\n  Corrosion is a disease and defect of the teeth when they\r\n  become carious and hollow, which most often happens in\r\n  the molars, especially if one does not clean them of\r\n  the adhering food which becomes moist and consequently\r\n  produces bad, sharp [acid] moisture that eats and\r\n  corrodes them, always gradually increasing, until it\r\n  spoils the teeth entirely, which afterward must fall away\r\n  in pieces not without pains.\r\n\r\n  “_Mesue ut supra capite proprio._” This, as Mesue writes,\r\n  is chiefly cured and removed in three ways. First, by\r\n  purging as treated upon above. Second, by dissolving the\r\n  material which renders them hollow and eats them away;\r\n  also by boiling cockles that grow in barley or wheat, in\r\n  vinegar and holding this in the mouth. In this vinegar\r\n  the root of caper and ginger and other similar remedies\r\n  must have been previously boiled. Third, by removing the\r\n  decay, which is done in two ways. First, by scraping\r\n  and cleaning the hole and the carious part with a fine\r\n  chisel, knife, or file, or other suitable instrument, as\r\n  is well known to practitioners, and then by filling the\r\n  cavity with gold leaves for the preservation of the other\r\n  portion of the tooth. Second, by using suitable medicine,\r\n  such as oak apples or wild galls, with which the tooth is\r\n  filled after having been cleaned.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: German text.]\r\n\r\n  The following editions of _Zahnarzneybuchlein_, besides\r\n  the Basle and Mayence editions noted by Dr. Guerini at\r\n  page 166, were issued and copies thereof are preserved\r\n  in the libraries of the several collectors as stated.\r\n  Edition of 1530, printed by Michael Blum, Leipzig, in\r\n  collection of Edward C.

K.]\r\n\r\nThe book, therefore, lacks importance from a dental point of view,\r\nexcept in the sense that it shows how little skilled in the cure of\r\ndental affections were the German surgeons of those days.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that this author, also, speaks of anesthetic\r\ninhalations; he, however, only translates, almost to a word, what Guy\r\nde Chauliac says on this subject.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the fifteenth century and in the first half of\r\nthe sixteenth there were published in German, by anonymous authors,\r\nsome short translations and compilations on dental subjects, taken\r\nespecially from Greek and Arabian authors.[275] Of these writings, the\r\nfirst one known, taken from Galen and Abulcasis, was printed at Basle\r\nin 1490; and another—one of the best—saw the light at Mayence in 1532.\r\nThese works were perhaps due to intelligent barbers, or perhaps—and\r\nthis seems to be the most probable—they were written, through the\r\ninitiative of enterprising printers, by doctors and surgeons, who\r\nwished to remain unknown, on account of the special subject treated;\r\nfor, owing to the fact that the diseases of the dental system were\r\ngenerally left in the hands of barbers and other unprofessional\r\npersons, the doctors and surgeons of those days would have been ashamed\r\nto interest themselves in such things.\r\n\r\nWALTER HERMANN RYFF, of Strasburg, was born in the beginning of the\r\nsixteenth century, and died about 1570. He was a rather mediocre doctor\r\nand surgeon, and a man of the worst morals, so much so that many cities\r\nexpelled him from their midst.[276] He wrote many medical works, in\r\nwhich, however, there is very little original matter. Their principal\r\nmerit consists, perhaps, in the fact that they were written not in\r\nLatin, as then was universally customary, but rather in the vernacular\r\nof the author and in a popular style; so that Ryff may be looked upon\r\nas the first who endeavored to diffuse among the people useful medical\r\nand hygienic knowledge.\r\n\r\nAmong Ryff’s books there are two which are very important to us. One\r\nis his _Major Surgery_, and the other is a pamphlet entitled _Useful\r\nInstruction on the Way to Keep Healthy, to Strengthen and Reinvigorate\r\nthe Eyes and the Sight. With Further Instruction on the Way of Keeping\r\nthe Mouth Fresh, the Teeth Clean, and the Gums Firm._[277]\r\n\r\nOf these books, there now only exist some extremely rare copies; so\r\nmuch so that neither Albert von Haller nor Kurt and Wilhelm Sprengel,\r\nwho rendered such great services to the history of surgery, ever\r\nhad the pleasure of examining them. Dr. Geist-Jacobi has been more\r\nfortunate than they, and has therefore been able to give us some very\r\ninteresting information about their contents.\r\n\r\nThe _Major Surgery_ is a mere compilation which does not contain\r\nanything new of importance. It was published in part in 1545, and in\r\npart in 1572, after the death of the author. The work is illustrated\r\nwith very beautiful wood engravings; and it is just this which gives\r\nthe principal value to this book. Some of the illustrations contained\r\nin the first part of it—that is, in that published in 1545—represent\r\ndental instruments, notwithstanding dental surgery is not treated in\r\nthis part of the book. The author gives notice that he will treat all\r\nthat concerns dental affections in the latter part of this book, in a\r\nspecial chapter. Unfortunately, this chapter was never written, because\r\ndeath prevented Ryff from completing the second part of his work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59\r\n\r\nPelican and dental forceps (Walter Hermann Ryff).]\r\n\r\nThe dental instruments represented in his _Major Surgery_ are many\r\nin number. Among them, first of all, are found the fourteen dental\r\nscrapers of Abulcasis, then the “duck-bill”—designed for the extraction\r\nof dental roots and broken teeth—various kinds of pelican (Fig. 59 A),\r\nthe “common dental forceps” (Fig. 59 B), the “goat’s foot,” and many\r\nother kinds of elevators, among which, observes Geist-Jacobi, may be\r\nseen instruments even now in use, and even some which are said to have\r\nbeen recently invented.\r\n\r\nRyff’s other book is especially noteworthy because, as we have\r\nalready mentioned, it treats, for the first time, of dental matters,\r\nindependently of general medicine and surgery. This pamphlet, printed\r\nat Würzburg about the year 1544, is made up of sixty-one pages, and\r\nis divided into three parts, the first of which is dedicated to the\r\neyes, the second to the teeth, and the third to the first dentition.\r\nIt is written in popular style, and the author certainly intended it\r\nfor the instruction of the public, and not for professional men; so\r\ntrue is this, that in it he does not speak of the technical part of the\r\nextraction of teeth, or of gold filling—a method already known for a\r\nlong time—or of dental prosthesis.\r\n\r\nThe first part, relative to diseases of the eyes and the manner of\r\ncuring them, has no importance for us. The second part begins with the\r\nfollowing paragraph:\r\n\r\n“The eyes and the teeth have an extraordinary affinity or reciprocal\r\nrelation to one another, by which they very easily communicate to each\r\nother their defects and diseases, so that the one cannot be perfectly\r\nhealthy without the other being so too.”[278]\r\n\r\nThis last statement is absolutely false, as a disease of the eyes\r\nmay very well exist with a perfect condition of the teeth, and _vice\r\nversa_. However, Ryff has the merit of being, perhaps, the first who\r\nhas noted the undeniable relation which exists between the dental and\r\nocular affections.\r\n\r\nAfter a rapid glance at the anatomy and physiology of the teeth, the\r\nauthor enumerates the causes of dental disease, which, according to\r\nhim, are principally heat, cold, the gathering of humors, and traumatic\r\nactions.\r\n\r\nThe prophylaxis of dental diseases is beyond any doubt one of the\r\nbest parts of the book; however, the ten rules counselled by Ryff\r\nfor keeping the teeth healthy—rules which Dr. Geist-Jacobi has made\r\nknown to us in full—are reproduced, almost to a word, from Giovanni\r\nd’Arcoli’s work; therefore, the author has no other merit than that\r\nof having translated them into the vulgar tongue, thus diffusing\r\nthe knowledge of useful precepts for preventing dental diseases. We\r\nrefrain from reproducing the aforesaid rules here, as they are, with\r\nslight variations, identical with those which we gave when speaking of\r\nArculanus.\r\n\r\nNor can any credit be given to Ryff for the rules which he gives in\r\nregard to the diagnosis of dental pains, as this part of his work is\r\nalso taken wholly from the Italian author just mentioned.\r\n\r\nAfter these diagnostic rules Ryff, continuing to translate from the\r\nbook of Giovanni d’Arcoli, adds:\r\n\r\n“If the pain comes from the gums, extraction is of no use; if it comes\r\nfrom the tooth, extraction makes it cease; when, lastly, it is in the\r\nnerve, sometimes extraction removes it, and sometimes it does not,\r\naccording as the matter obtains or not a free exit.”\r\n\r\nThe barbers and tooth-drawers, he says, must well remember this rule,\r\nin order to avoid extracting, thoughtlessly and with no benefit, sound\r\nteeth, since then the pain persists in spite of the operation. Also, it\r\nmust be borne in mind that, in case of violent pain, it is necessary to\r\noperate as soon as possible, so that the patient may not faint or be\r\nattacked by the falling sickness, if the pain should be communicated to\r\nthe heart or brain.\r\n\r\nThe idea that violent dental pains could give rise to syncope or to\r\nepilepsy (in regard to which we only observe that even very recent\r\nwriters enumerate dental caries among the causes of the so-called\r\nreflex epilepsy) is also found in Giovanni d’Arcoli, who expresses\r\nhimself in regard to this in the following terms: “Such very violent\r\npains are sometimes followed by syncope or epilepsy, through injury\r\ncommunicated to the heart or brain.”[279]\r\n\r\n“The most atrocious pain,” says Ryff, “is when an apostema ripens in\r\nthe root;” literal translation of words written about a century before\r\nby Arculanus: “Fortissima dolor est, qui provenit ab apostemate, quod\r\nin radice dentis maturatur.”\r\n\r\nLikewise taken from Arculanus is the observation (already made,\r\nhowever, by much more ancient writers) that “when the cheeks swell,\r\ntoothache ceases.” Arculanus, however, expresses himself in a less\r\nabsolute manner, and therefore more corresponding to the truth, since\r\nhe says “the pain generally ceases” (secundum plurimum dolor sedatur).\r\n\r\nEven in regard to the therapeutics of dental pains, Ryff does not tell\r\nus anything new. Dr. Geist-Jacobi gives this author the merit of having\r\nmade, in regard to the cure of dental pains, a distinction between\r\n_cura mendosa_ (that is, imperfect, palliative, tending simply to calm\r\nthe pain) and _cura vera_ (that is, directed against the causes of\r\nthe disease). But this very important distinction is also taken from\r\nArculanus, who in his turn took it from Mesue. In fact, after having\r\nspoken of the general rules relative to the cure of dental diseases,\r\nGiovanni of Arcoli adds: “As to the particular therapy, it is divided\r\ninto _cura mendosa_ and _cura vera_, as may be found in Mesue. And the\r\n_cura mendosa_ is so called because it calms the pain by abolishing\r\nsensibility, not by taking away the cause of it. Such is, for the sake\r\nof example, the cure, consisting in fumigations of henbane, made to\r\nreach the diseased tooth by means of a small tube, adapted to a funnel.”\r\n\r\nThe third part of Ryff’s pamphlet has as its title:\r\n\r\n“How the pains of the gums should be calmed or mitigated in suckling\r\ninfants, so as to promote the cutting of the teeth without pain.”\r\n\r\nThis part, as Geist-Jacobi informs us, is very brief, not taking up\r\nmore than a page and one-half of print. Neither does it contain\r\nanything of importance. To render the cutting of teeth easier, Ryff\r\nadvises that infants should have little wax candles given to them to\r\nchew and the gums anointed with butter, duck’s fat, hare’s brains, and\r\nthe like. The tooth of a wolf may be hung around the neck of the child,\r\nso that it may gnaw at it. It is also recommended that the head of the\r\nchild should be bathed with an infusion of chamomile.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, one may see very clearly that the aforesaid\r\nbook is, from the scientific point of view, entirely valueless,\r\nbecause the best part of it is merely copied from the work of Giovanni\r\nd’Arcoli. However, the author has the indisputable merit of having\r\nendeavored to diffuse the knowledge of useful precepts of dental\r\nhygiene. His book, besides, we repeat, has great historical value, for\r\nfrom it dates the beginning of odontologic literature, properly so\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\nOn this point we believe it is necessary to correct an error into which\r\nDr. Geist-Jacobi has fallen. At the beginning of his very valuable\r\narticle on Walter Hermann Ryff[280] he says: “In the fifth century of\r\nthe Christian era, the iatrosophist Adamantius of Alexandria published\r\nan exclusively odontalgic work, of which, however, we only know the\r\ntitle.” The same he repeats in his _History of Dental Art_ (pp. 55 and\r\n56), without, however, giving us any proof of his statement. “Of the\r\nodontologic treatise of Adamantius,” he says, “unfortunately the title\r\nalone is known to us, and even that has reached us indirectly, that is,\r\nby means of Ætius; it is of the following tenor.”\r\n\r\nNow, whoever takes the trouble to translate these Greek words will\r\neasily perceive that they do not constitute one title, but two distinct\r\nones (which even Dr. Geist-Jacobi has had to unite by the conjunction\r\n_and_). These, however, are nothing more than the titles of two\r\nchapters of the _Tetrabiblos_ of Ætius, as anyone may see for himself\r\nby turning over the pages of this work either in the Greek original, or\r\nin the beautiful Latin translation of Giano Cornario (Venice, 1553).\r\nIn this great composition of Ætius dental diseases are treated of in\r\nChapters XXVII to XXXV of Sermo IV, Tetrabiblos II; and the two Greek\r\ntitles above referred to are the titles of Chapters XXVII and XXXI.\r\n\r\nIn the translation of Giano Cornario they read as follows:\r\n\r\n_Cura dentium a calido morbo doloroso affectorum, ex Adamantio\r\nsophista_ (cure of teeth affected by warm, painful disease, according\r\nto Adamantius the sophist).\r\n\r\n_Cura dentium a siccitate dolore affectorum, ex Adamantio sophista_\r\n(cure of teeth affected by pain from dryness, according to Adamantius\r\nthe sophist).\r\n\r\nThe work of Adamantius, from which Ætius took the contents of the\r\nchapters thus entitled, is lost to us, but we have no reason, and not\r\neven the least indication, for supposing that this work was a treatise\r\non dental diseases, and not one on general medicine. It is absurd to\r\nconsider the above-mentioned titles as belonging to an odontological\r\nmonograph, on the one hand, because, admitting for a moment the\r\nexistence of such a work, it should have had but one title and not two,\r\nand on the other hand, because it is by no means to be supposed that a\r\ngreat and wise physician, such as Adamantius undoubtedly was, should\r\nhave had the whim to write a book, not on dental disease or on dental\r\npains in general, but only and exclusively on dental pains caused by\r\nheat or by dryness. What reason would there have been for not extending\r\nthe treatment of the subject to those cases of odontalgia resulting\r\nfrom humidity or from cold, that is, from causes as common and,\r\naccording to the ideas of that time, very frequently associated with\r\none of the first two (as humidity with heat, and cold with dryness)?\r\n\r\nBesides, if the titles of the two chapters spoken of be compared with\r\nthose of the others, in which Ætius treats of dental affections, such\r\nanalogy will be noticed between the various titles as to make us\r\nconsider that they have been formulated by Ætius himself, even when the\r\ncontents of these chapters are taken from other writers. So that the\r\ntwo aforesaid titles not only do not belong to any dental work, but\r\nprobably they have never existed, even as simple titles of chapters,\r\nin the medical book of Adamantius, from which the contents of the two\r\nchapters of Ætius above mentioned have been taken.\r\n\r\nIn order that every one may easily be convinced that the two titles\r\nmade so conspicuous by Dr. Geist-Jacobi have nothing particular about\r\nthem, but are, instead, perfectly analogous to the titles of various\r\nother chapters of Ætius, we give here the translation of the titles\r\nof five chapters, all concerning dental maladies, that is, the two\r\nchapters in discussion and other three:\r\n\r\nChapter XXVII: Cure of teeth affected by warm, painful disease,\r\naccording to Adamantius the sophist.\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX: Cure of teeth affected with pain from humidity.\r\n\r\nChapter XXXI: Cure of teeth affected by pain from dryness, according to\r\nAdamantius the sophist.\r\n\r\nChapter XXXII: Cure of teeth affected by pain from heat and humidity.\r\n\r\nChapter XXXIII: Cure of decayed teeth, according to Galen.\r\n\r\nIt appears very clear, therefore, from the great analogy existing\r\nbetween the headings of all the above-mentioned chapters, that the\r\ntitles referred to by Geist-Jacobi have not at all the historical\r\nimportance and significance that he attributes to them, and that the\r\nsame have been formulated by Ætius himself. To argue from such titles\r\nthat Adamantius was the author of a book on dentistry is not only\r\ninadmissible, for all the reasons already given, but also because\r\nif it were allowable to reason with such lightness, it might also\r\nbe stated—by arguing from the title of Chapter XXXIII—that Galen\r\nwas the author of a monograph on the treatment of dental caries; a\r\nthing which is absolutely untrue. Consequently, the beginning of\r\nodontologic literature cannot be traced back to Adamantius, but, as Dr.\r\nGeist-Jacobi would have it, to an author much less ancient, that is,\r\nto Walter Hermann Ryff, or, if it is preferred, even to the anonymous\r\nwriters of the odontologic compilations which appeared in Germany at\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nANDREAS VESALIUS. We must now speak of Andreas Vesalius, an\r\nextraordinary man, who by his genius infused new life into medical\r\nscience, and who, although he gave but little attention to dental\r\nmatters, yet fully deserves a place of honor in the history of\r\ndentistry; for this, like every other branch of medicine, received\r\ngreat advantage from his reforming work, which broke down forever the\r\nauthority of Galen, thus freeing the minds of medical men from an\r\nenslavement which made every real progress impossible.\r\n\r\nAndreas Vesalius was born at Brussels, December 31, 1514. He studied\r\nat Louvain and then at Paris, where at that time great scientists\r\ntaught, and among others the celebrated anatomist Jacques Dubois,\r\ngenerally known by the Latinized name of Sylvius.[281] The latter, a\r\ngreat admirer of Galen, whose anatomical writings served as texts for\r\nhis lectures, became jealous of the young Belgian student, who was\r\nhis assistant, and who gave undoubted proofs of great genius, and of\r\nextraordinary passion in anatomical research. Vesalius often defied the\r\ngreatest dangers in order to obtain corpses either from the cemetery\r\nof the Innocents or from the scaffold at Montfaucon. He soon surpassed\r\nhis most illustrious masters, and at only twenty-five years of age\r\npublished splendid anatomical plates, which astonished the learned. He\r\nacquired also great renown as surgeon, and in this capacity he followed\r\nthe army of Charles V in one of his wars against France. After having\r\nbeen professor of anatomy in the celebrated University of Louvain\r\n(Belgium), he was invited by the Venetian Republic to teach in the\r\nUniversity of Padua, which, through him, became the first anatomical\r\nschool in Europe. Yielding to the requests of the magistrates of\r\nBologna and Pisa, he also taught in those famous universities, before\r\nimmense audiences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Andreas Vesalius.]\r\n\r\nBefore Vesalius, Galen’s anatomy had served as the constant basis\r\nfor the teaching of this science. Although even from the end of the\r\nfifteenth century dead bodies were dissected in all the principal\r\nuniversities, the teachers of anatomy always conformed, in their\r\ndescriptions, to those of Galen, so that the authority of this master,\r\nheld infallible, prevailed even over the reality of facts.\r\n\r\nVesalius, for the first time, dared to unveil and clearly put in\r\nevidence the errors of Galen; but this made him many enemies among the\r\nblind followers and worshippers of that demigod of medicine. Europe\r\nresounded with the invectives that were bestowed upon Vesalius. Among\r\nothers, there rose against him Eustachio at Rome, Dryander at Marburg,\r\nSylvius at Paris, and this last did not spare any calumny that might\r\ndegrade his old pupil, who had become so celebrated. In spite of this,\r\nthe fame of Vesalius kept on growing more and more, so much so that\r\nCharles V called him to Madrid, to the post of chief physician of his\r\nCourt, a place which he kept under Philip II, also after the abdication\r\nof Charles V. The good fortune of Vesalius, unhappily, was not to be of\r\nlong duration. In 1564 a Spanish gentleman died, in spite of the care\r\nbestowed upon him by Vesalius, and the illustrious scientist requested\r\nfrom the family, and with difficulty obtained, the permission to\r\ndissect the body. At the moment in which the thoracic cavity was opened\r\nthe heart was seen, or thought to be seen, beating. The matter reached\r\nthe ears of the relations of the deceased, and they accused Vesalius,\r\nbefore the Inquisition, of murder and sacrilege; and he certainly would\r\nnot have escaped death except by the intervention of Philip II, who, to\r\nsave him, desired that he should go on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land,\r\nas an expiation. On his return, the ship which carried Vesalius was\r\nwrecked, and he was cast on a desert beach of the Isle of Zante, where,\r\naccording to the testimony of a Venetian traveller, he died of hunger,\r\nOctober 15, 1564.\r\n\r\nVesalius left to the world an immortal monument, his splendid treatise\r\non Anatomy,[282] published by him when only twenty-eight years of age,\r\nand of which, from 1543 to 1725, not less than fifteen editions were\r\nissued. The appearance of this work marked the commencement of a new\r\nera. The struggle between the supporters of Galen and those of Vesalius\r\nrendered necessary, on both sides, active research concerning the\r\nstructure of the human body, so that anatomy, the principal basis of\r\nscientific medicine, gradually became more and more perfect, and, as\r\na consequence of this, as well as of the importance which the direct\r\nobservation of facts acquired over the authority of the ancients,\r\nthere began in all branches of medicine a continual, ever-increasing\r\nprogress, which gave and still gives splendid results, such as would\r\nhave been impossible under the dominion of Galenic dogmatism.\r\n\r\nIn the great work of Vesalius the anatomy of the teeth is unfortunately\r\ntreated with much less accuracy than that of the other parts of the\r\nbody. However, his description of the dental apparatus[283] is far\r\nmore exact than that of Galen, and represents real progress. The number\r\nof the roots of the molar teeth (large and small) is indicated by Galen\r\nin a very vague and inexact manner, since he says that the ten upper\r\nmolars have generally three, sometimes four roots, and that the lower\r\nones have generally two, and rarely three. Vesalius, having examined\r\nthe teeth and the number of their roots in a great number of skulls,\r\nwas able to be much more precise. In regard to roots, he makes, for the\r\nfirst time, a very clear distinction between the premolars next to the\r\ncanine (small molars) and the other three, and says that the former\r\nin the upper jaw usually have two roots, and in the lower, one only,\r\nwhilst the last three upper molars usually have three roots and the\r\nlower ones two. As everyone sees, these indications are, in the main,\r\nexact.\r\n\r\nOther important facts established by Vesalius are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe canines are, of all the teeth, those which have the longest roots.\r\nThe middle upper incisors are larger and broader than the lateral\r\nones, and their roots are longer. The roots of the last molars are\r\nsmaller than those of the two preceding molars. In the penultimate\r\nand antepenultimate molars, more often than in the other teeth, it\r\nsometimes happens that a greater number of roots than usual are found,\r\nit being not very rare to meet with upper molars with four roots, and\r\nlower ones with three. The molars are not always five in each half jaw;\r\nsometimes there are only four, either on each side, or on one side\r\nonly, in only one jaw or in both. Such differences generally depend\r\non the last molar, which does not always appear externally, remaining\r\nsometimes completely hidden in the maxillary bone, or only just\r\npiercing with some of its cusps the thin plate of bone which covers it;\r\na thing which Vesalius could observe in many skulls in the cemeteries.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the last molar, the author speaks of its tardy eruption\r\nand of the violent pains which not unfrequently accompany it. The\r\ndoctors, he adds, not recognizing the cause of the pain, to make it\r\ncease have recourse to the extraction of teeth, or else, attributing it\r\nto some defects of the humors, overwhelm the sufferer with pills and\r\nother internal remedies, whereas the best remedy would have been the\r\nscarification of the gums in the region of the last molar and sometimes\r\nthe piercing of the osseous plate which covers it.\r\n\r\nThis curative method, of which no one can fail to recognize the\r\nimportance, was experimented by Vesalius on himself, in his\r\ntwenty-sixth year, precisely at the time that he had just begun to\r\nwrite his great treatise on anatomy.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the central chamber of the teeth appears to have been\r\nunknown to Galen, as he does not allude to it in the least. Vesalius\r\nwas the first to put this most important anatomical fact in evidence.\r\nHe expresses an opinion that the central cavity facilitates the\r\nnutrition of the tooth. He says, besides, that when a hole is produced\r\nin a tooth by reason of acrid corrosive humors, the corrosion, when\r\nonce the internal cavity is reached, spreads rapidly and deeply in the\r\ntooth, owing to the existence of the said cavity, and sometimes reaches\r\neven the end of the root.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter in which Vesalius treats of the anatomy of the teeth\r\n(Chapter XI, p. 40), two very well-drawn figures are found, one of\r\nwhich represents a section of a lower molar, showing the pulp cavity\r\nand its prolongation into the two root canals. The other represents the\r\nupper and lower teeth of the right side, in their reciprocal positions,\r\nand shows very clearly their general shape, the length of their roots,\r\nand the number of these.\r\n\r\nThe changes which take place in the alveolus, after the extraction of\r\na tooth have not escaped the notice of Vesalius. He says that after\r\nan extraction the walls of the alveolus approach one another, and the\r\ncavity is gradually obliterated.\r\n\r\nAristotle had affirmed that men have a greater number of teeth than\r\nwomen. Vesalius declares this opinion absolutely false—although, after\r\nAristotle, it has been repeated by many other ancient writers—and says\r\nthat anyone can convince himself that the assertion of Aristotle is\r\ncontrary to the truth, as it is possible for everybody to count his own\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, we find the above-mentioned error even in writers\r\nsubsequent to Vesalius; for example, in Heurnius (professor at Leyden\r\ntoward the end of the sixteenth century), who expresses an opinion that\r\nrarely do women have thirty-two teeth, like men.\r\n\r\nWe find but little in Vesalius concerning the development of the teeth.\r\nHe, indeed, made some observations and researches on this point, but\r\nthese, from their insufficiency, led him to quite mistaken conclusions.\r\nThe teeth of children, he says, have imperfect, soft, and, as it were,\r\nmedullary roots; and the part of the tooth which appears above the gums\r\nis united to the root, so to say, as a mere appendix, after the fall of\r\nwhich there grows from the root the permanent tooth. This error arose\r\nin the mind of Vesalius from observing that when children lose their\r\nmilk teeth, these have the appearance of a kind of stump, as if the\r\nroot had actually remained in the socket. Besides this, he had observed\r\nwith what facility the milk teeth fall out; and he here calls to mind\r\nthat, when about seven years old, he himself and his companions used to\r\npluck out their loosened teeth, and especially the incisors, with their\r\nfingers, or with a thread tied around the tooth. The softness of the\r\ndental roots in children, the easy fall of the milk teeth, and the want\r\nof the lower part of the roots in these, must have raised the idea\r\nin his mind that the roots of the milk teeth remained in the socket,\r\nand that the upper part of the temporary teeth, instead of being a\r\ncontinuation of the root, was joined to this as a simple appendix, and\r\nin a very weak way, as though designed to remain in place for a limited\r\nlength of time only.\r\n\r\nIn Vesalius[284] is found a dental terminology—Latin, Greek, Hebrew,\r\nand Arabic—which affords some interest. The incisors are called in\r\nLatin _incisorii_, _risorii_, _quaterni_, _quadrupli_; and the two\r\nmiddle incisors have been denominated by some authors _duales_. The\r\ncanines are called in Greek kynodontes, which means the same as the\r\nLatin _canini_, dog’s teeth. In Latin they have been also denominated\r\n_mordentes_, and by some also _risorii_, a name which by others is\r\ngiven to the incisors, as we have already seen. The molars have\r\nalso been called in Latin _maxillares_, _paxillares_, _mensales_,\r\n_genuini_.[285] But some authors give this last name only to the last\r\nmolars, or wisdom teeth, _dentes sensus et sapientiæ et intellectus_.\r\nThese teeth have also been called _serotini_ (that is, tardy), _ætatem\r\ncomplentes_ (that is, completing the age, the growth), and also, in\r\nbarbaric Latin, _cayseles_ or _caysales_, _negugidi_, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the rebellion against the authority of the ancients, Vesalius had\r\na predecessor whose name, deservedly famous, may be recorded here.\r\nPARACELSUS (born in 1493 at Maria-Einsiedeln, Switzerland), on being\r\nnominated, in 1527, Professor of Medicine and Surgery at Basle,\r\ninaugurated his lectures by burning in the presence of his audience,\r\nwho were stunned by such temerity, the writings of Galen and Avicenna,\r\njust as Luther, seven years before, had burnt in the public square of\r\nWittenberg the papal bulls and decretals. The sixteenth century, in its\r\nexuberance of intellectual life, was undoubtedly one of the grandest\r\ncenturies in history; human thought in that glorious epoch shattered\r\nits chains, and declared its freedom both in matters of science and of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, a man of powerful genius, but not well balanced in mind, of\r\ncorrupt morals, and of an unlimited pride, had, notwithstanding these\r\nundeniable defects, the merit of beginning a healthy reform in the\r\nscience and practice of medicine, by substituting the study of nature\r\nfor the authority of the ancients and by giving a great importance to\r\nchemistry, both for the explanation of organic phenomena and for the\r\ncure of disease.\r\n\r\nIt is to be lamented that this man of genius did not contribute in any\r\nway to the progress of dentistry. His works have no importance for\r\nus. As a matter of mere curiosity we only record here that Paracelsus\r\nconsidered the too precocious development of the teeth as a great\r\nanomaly, and regarded as monsters those children who were born with\r\nteeth.[286]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paracelcus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gian Filippo Ingrassia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gabriel Fallopius.]\r\n\r\nGIAN FILIPPO INGRASSIA (1510 to 1580), a distinguished Sicilian\r\nanatomist, was one of the first who spoke of the dental germ. He says\r\nthat the existence of the tooth properly so called is preceded by that\r\nof a soft dental substance enclosed in the bone, and which he considers\r\nalmost as a secretion of the latter.\r\n\r\nMATTEO REALDO COLOMBO, of Cremona, a pupil of Vesalius and his\r\nsuccessor in the professorship of Anatomy at Padua, added but little,\r\nas regards the teeth, to what his master has taught. He combated the\r\nerroneous idea that the teeth were formed in the alveoli shortly before\r\ntheir eruption. Having dissected the jaws of many fetuses, and having\r\nalways observed in them the existence of teeth, he could affirm with\r\nevery certainty that the teeth begin to be formed in intra-uterine life.\r\n\r\nLike Vesalius, Realdo Colombo believed that the permanent teeth were\r\ndeveloped from the roots of the milk teeth; and, therefore, he advised\r\nthe utmost caution in extracting these, since, if the whole root were\r\nremoved, the tooth would not grow again.[287]\r\n\r\nGABRIEL FALLOPIUS (1523 to 1562), the eminent anatomist of Modena, also\r\na disciple of Vesalius, carried out accurate and successful researches\r\nin regard to the development of the teeth, and made them known in his\r\nbook, _Observationes anatomicæ_, published at Venice in 1562, the year\r\nin which he died.\r\n\r\nHis investigations enabled him to show the falsity of the opinion held\r\nby Vesalius, that the permanent teeth are developed from the roots of\r\nthe temporary ones. He was, besides, the first who spoke in clear terms\r\nof the dental follicle.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, says Fallopius,[288] are generated twice over, that is,\r\nthe first time in the uterus, after the formation of the jaws, and\r\nthe second time in extra-uterine life, before the seventh year. The\r\nfirst teeth are, at the time of birth, still imperfect, without roots,\r\ncompletely enclosed in their alveoli, and formed of two different\r\nsubstances; the part with which they must break their way out is\r\nosseous and hollowed; the deeper part, instead, is soft and humid\r\nand is seen covered with a thin pellicle, a thing which may also be\r\nobserved in the feathers of birds when they are still tender. In\r\nfact, the part of the feather which comes out of the skin is hard and\r\ncorneous, whilst the part which is embedded in the wings is soft and\r\nhumid and has the appearance of coagulated blood or mucus. So also in\r\nthe fetal teeth, the part corresponding to the future root presents\r\nitself like coagulated mucus. Little by little this soft substance\r\nhardens and becomes osseous, thus constituting the root of the tooth.\r\n\r\nFallopius’ reference to the analogy between the development of teeth\r\nand that of feathers was highly important, as a point of departure\r\nfor embryological researches which showed clearly the real nature of\r\nteeth, thus destroying the mistaken idea—held by Galen and many other\r\nauthors—that these organs were bones.\r\n\r\nOn coming to speak of the teeth generated in extra-uterine life, that\r\nis of the permanent teeth, Fallopius relates having observed that\r\nthey have their origin in the following manner: A membranous follicle\r\nis formed inside the bone furnished with two apices, one posterior\r\n(that is to say, deeper down, more distant from the surface of the\r\ngums), to which is joined a small nerve, a small artery, and a small\r\nvein (_cui nervulus, et arteriola, et venula applicantur_); the other\r\nanterior (that is more superficial), which terminates in a filament\r\nor small string, like a tail. This string reaches right to the gum,\r\npassing through a very narrow aperture in the bone, by the side of the\r\ntooth which is to be substituted by the new one. Inside the follicle\r\nis formed a special white and tenacious substance, and from this the\r\ntooth itself, which at first is osseous only in the part nearest the\r\nsurface, whilst the deeper part is still soft, that is, formed of the\r\nabove-mentioned substance. Each tooth comes out traversing and widening\r\nthe narrow aperture through which the “tail” of the follicle passes.\r\nThe latter breaks, and the tooth comes out of the gum, bare and hard;\r\nand in process of time the formation of its deeper part is completed.\r\n\r\nThe author says that his long and laborious researches into the\r\ndevelopment of the teeth were carried out with great accuracy, and\r\nhe is, therefore, in a position to give as absolute certainties the\r\nfacts exposed by him. Indeed, the observations of Fallopius were, for\r\nthe most part, confirmed by subsequent research. As to the “tail”\r\nof the dental follicle, it is identical with the _iter dentis_ or\r\n_gubernaculum dentis_ of some authors. Fallopius described it as a\r\nsimple string, but later on this prolongation of the dental follicle\r\nhas been considered, at least by some, as the narrowest part or neck\r\nof the follicle itself, that is, as a channel through which the tooth\r\npasses, widening it, on its way out, and precisely for this reason it\r\nhas been called _iter dentis_ (the way of the tooth) or _gubernaculum\r\ndentis_ (helm or guide of the tooth).\r\n\r\nBARTHOLOMEUS EUSTACHIUS, another great anatomist of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, occupied himself in the study of teeth with special interest,\r\nand wrote a very valuable monograph on this subject. He was a native\r\nof San Severino, Marche (Italy), and a contemporary of Vesalius,\r\nIngrassia, Realdo Colombo, and Fallopius; he died in 1574, after having\r\nimmortalized his name through many anatomical discoveries and writings\r\nof the highest value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bartholomeus Eustachius]\r\n\r\nHis book on the teeth, _Libellus de dentibus_, published at Venice in\r\n1563, is the first treatise ever written on the anatomy of teeth,\r\nand represents a noteworthy progress in this branch of study.\r\n\r\nIn this little book—divided into thirty chapters, forming in all\r\nninety-five pages—the author treats with great accuracy and in an\r\nadmirable manner all that concerns the anatomy, physiology, and\r\ndevelopment of the teeth.\r\n\r\nEustachius not only treasured up what ancient authors had written on\r\nthis subject, but he himself made very long and patient researches and\r\nobservations on men and animals, on living individuals as well as on\r\ncorpses, and not only on adult subjects, but also on children of every\r\nage, on stillborn children and on abortive fetuses.\r\n\r\nThe macroscopic anatomy of the teeth was brought by him to a high\r\ndegree of perfection. Very wonderful, among other things, is the\r\naccuracy with which he studied and specified in several synoptical\r\ntables the number of the roots of molar teeth, and all the variations\r\noccurring not only in their number, but also in their form, length, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV, speaking of the means by which teeth are held in their\r\nsockets, Eustachius mentions in quite explicit terms the ligaments of\r\nthe teeth. He begins by saying that the perfect correspondence between\r\nthe dental roots and the alveoli, both in shape and in size, is one of\r\nthe elements which contribute to the firmness of the teeth, since the\r\nalveolus, being exactly applied, on all sides, to the root or roots\r\nof the tooth, causes the latter, by this simple fact, to be fixed in\r\na determined position. Also, the nerves inserted in each single tooth\r\ncontribute, as was already the opinion of Galen, to the stability of\r\nthese organs. “There exist besides”—Eustachius continues—“very strong\r\nligaments, principally attached to the roots, by which these latter\r\nare tightly connected with the alveoli” (_adsunt præterea vincula\r\nfortissima radicibus præcipue adherentia, quibus præsepiolis arctissime\r\ncolligantur_). Lastly, says the author, the gums, too, embracing the\r\nteeth at their exit from the alveoli, contribute to their firmness.\r\nAnd here Eustachius notes that in the joining of the gums to the teeth\r\nthere is great analogy to that of the skin with the finger nails;\r\na very proper observation, which makes us almost suppose that the\r\nperspicacious mind of Eustachius may have guessed the kindred nature of\r\nnails and teeth.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XV are related the researches made by the author to\r\nascertain at what period the development of the teeth begins. Here is a\r\npassage of this chapter, almost literally translated:\r\n\r\n“Hippocrates, before anyone else, wrote that the first teeth are\r\nformed in the uterus. Wishing to assure myself thereof, I dissected\r\nmany abortive fetuses, and by very careful observations I found it to\r\nbe true that the teeth have their origin during intra-uterine life.\r\nWherefore, the opinion of those who consider that the first teeth are\r\nformed from the milk, and those of the second dentition from food\r\nand drink, must be declared entirely false. In fact, by opening both\r\njaws of a stillborn fetus, one may find, on each side of each jaw,\r\nthe incisors, the canine, and three molars, partly mucous and partly\r\nosseous, and already sufficiently large and entirely surrounded by\r\ntheir alveoli. Then removing, with a skilful hand, the incisors and\r\nthe canines, there may be observed a very thin partition only just\r\nossified; and if this be removed with equal care, an equal number of\r\nincisors and canines, almost mucous and very much smaller, appear,\r\nwhich, enclosed in special alveoli behind the first, would exactly\r\ncorrespond in position each with its congener, if in both jaws the\r\ncanine were not resting for the greater part on the next incisor so as\r\nalmost to hide it.”\r\n\r\nAs to the molars (by which name also the bicuspids are here meant),\r\nEustachius says that he found but three on each side, and no trace\r\nwhatever of the others. Nevertheless, he considers it quite probable\r\nthat the germs of the latter should also exist in the fetus, although\r\nso small as to escape observation. He gives many ingenious reasons in\r\nsupport of his mode of thinking, and comes to the general conclusion,\r\nthat not only the temporary teeth but also the permanent ones have,\r\nall of them, their origin during fetal life; a false conclusion simply\r\nbecause too general, and which shows once more how, in biological\r\nscience, one runs great risk of falling into error whenever one tries\r\nto draw too free deductions from observed phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe researches of Fallopius and Eustachius confirm and complete each\r\nother. These two eminent anatomists, who gave great glory to Italy\r\nby their immortal discoveries and works, were the first to shed a\r\nbrilliant light upon the development of the teeth, and thus opened up\r\nthe way to all subsequent research on odontogeny.\r\n\r\nIn settling the period in which the formation of the teeth begins,\r\nFallopius was still more successful than Eustachius. His patient\r\ninvestigations showed him that the development of the teeth commences\r\npartly in the uterus and partly after birth, which is perfectly true,\r\nas was made clear by later embryological researches. Fallopius found in\r\neach fetal jaw twelve teeth.[289] In this he agrees perfectly with his\r\ncontemporary, Eustachius, who, as we have seen a short while ago, found\r\nin fetusus, only just born, the incisors, the canines, and three molars\r\nfor each side of each jaw. Eustachius, however, observed in the fetus\r\nthe germs of the permanent incisors and canines as well, a thing not\r\nnoted by Fallopius.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be wondered at that some discrepancy should exist between\r\nthe observations of these two eminent anatomists. The researches of\r\nwhich we are speaking are sufficiently delicate and difficult; and\r\neven much more recent authors are far from agreeing perfectly, as far\r\nas regards the period, in which the development of the teeth begins.\r\nSerres, in his _Essai sur l’anatomie et la physiologie des dents_\r\n(Paris, 1817), sustains the view that in the fetus he has observed the\r\ngerms of all the teeth, both temporary and permanent, while Joseph\r\nLinderer (_Handbuch der Zahnheilkunde_, Berlin, 1842) says that,\r\nalthough he has followed the preparative method indicated by Serres, he\r\ncould never discover in the fetus the germs of all the teeth. Perhaps,\r\nhe adds, the time when the development of the teeth begins varies\r\nconsiderably in individuals, just as we remark differences in the time\r\nof eruption.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XVII of his book, Eustachius speaks of the process of\r\nformation of the teeth, which he studied in abortive fetuses, in\r\nstillborn children, in children a few months old, and also in kids.\r\n\r\nOn dissecting a fetal jaw, there may be found on each side, as we\r\nhave already seen, the incisors, the canines, and three molars, still\r\nsoft and imperfect, separated from one another by very thin osseous\r\npartitions. Each of these teeth is enclosed within a follicle or little\r\nbag of a grayish white color, rather more mucous and glutinous than\r\nmembranous, and in form somewhat like the pod of a vegetable, with the\r\nonly difference that it shows an opening at one of the extremities,\r\nfrom which the tooth somewhat protrudes, as if it were germinating. The\r\nmore recent and softer the tooth, the more its follicle has a mucous\r\nappearance and differs from the nature of membranes. As it does not\r\nadhere to the underlying tooth, it is easy to separate them. As to\r\nthe tooth, it is at that period of its development partly osseous and\r\npartly mucous, since that part which later on projects from the gum\r\nsoon becomes transformed into a white thin and concave scale, which\r\ngives the idea of one of the little cells of a honeycomb. This scale\r\nis harder and more conspicuous in the incisors, since these, at this\r\nstage, are better formed; the canines are less advanced in development,\r\nand the molars still less; and among these latter, those are less\r\ndeveloped which are more distant from the canines. The deeper part\r\nof the tooth consists of a mucous and tenacious substance, harder,\r\nhowever, than the substance of the follicle, and of a whitish color\r\nwith a tendency to dark red, translucent, and somewhat brilliant.\r\n\r\nThus, says Eustachius, the teeth present themselves in a human fetus;\r\nbut he who cannot obtain a human fetus may observe the same things in a\r\nkid.\r\n\r\nAlthough the author does not express himself very explicitly, he seems\r\nto consider the follicle of the tooth substantially identical with\r\nits ligament. “This is at first mucous, but afterward, becoming more\r\nconsistent, causes the tooth to adhere to the socket and gum very\r\nfirmly, as if it were glued.”\r\n\r\n“As the part of the tooth which comes out of the gum projects from\r\nthe aperture of the follicle like a gem from its bezel, so—says\r\nEustachius—some believe that the crown of a temporary tooth is a mere\r\nappendix, and that the follicle comes out of its concavity through\r\na dividing line which they imagine to exist between this supposed\r\nappendix and the remaining part of the tooth. But assuredly those who\r\nassert such things show that they have studied the anatomy of the teeth\r\nso carelessly that, by this one error, they make manifest their great\r\nignorance together with their great temerity.[290] The line which is\r\nobserved on the tooth on the part corresponding to the adhesion of the\r\ngingival margin and of the dental ligament is very superficial, and\r\nafter having scraped it away, there does not remain any trace of a\r\ndivision. But apart from this everyone can very easily observe, even in\r\ninfants, or in kids, that the tooth when ossified does not present any\r\nline of division and that the still mucous follicle envelops it freely,\r\nand may be easily separated from the tooth; which would not be the\r\ncase, if the follicle issued from between the tooth and its supposed\r\nappendix.”\r\n\r\nThus, Eustachius declares entirely false the opinion already expressed\r\nby Celsus, that the permanent tooth grows from the root of the milk\r\ntooth. He affirms clearly and decisively that between the external and\r\nthe radical part of a milk tooth no real division exists, and that\r\nthe ossification of the tooth, beginning from the crown, proceeds\r\nwithout any interruption right down to the end of the root. If it\r\nwere true, says he, that in children only the imaginary epiphysis or\r\nappendix falls, and that the new tooth is substantially represented\r\nby the remaining part of the first, it could never happen, as instead\r\nit often does, that the new tooth appears before the first one falls.\r\nBesides, between the lower part of the first tooth and the upper part\r\nof the second no correspondence exists either in size or shape, as\r\nought necessarily to be the case if the two parts were joined together.\r\nThis is not all; the lower part of the temporary tooth is perforated,\r\nand receives in its interior bloodvessels and nerves, whilst the upper\r\npart of the permanent tooth is quite massive and imperforated. How,\r\nthen, could this second tooth transmit bloodvessels and nerves into\r\nthe cavity of the first? Again, how could the continuity of these\r\nbloodvessels and nerves with their respective branches be possible, if\r\nan imperforate body, such as the crown of the permanent tooth, were\r\nreally interposed?\r\n\r\nBut what is the use of so many arguments? exclaimed Eustachius. To\r\nremove even the slightest doubt and to put an end to any controversy\r\non such a point, only one fact is sufficient, which is revealed to us\r\nby anatomical dissection, and that is, that the teeth which appear\r\nabout the seventh year are not only not united to those which fall at\r\nthe same period, but cannot even be in contact with them, owing to the\r\npresence of a thin osseous partition.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter[291] Eustachius speaks of the central cavity\r\nof the teeth and of the substance contained in it. In young teeth,\r\nhe says, the dental cavity is very large, in proportion to the size\r\nof the tooth. According to some anatomists, the central cavity of a\r\ntooth is coated by a very soft and thin membrane, formed by a tissue\r\nof very small vessels and nerves; and besides, this cavity is filled\r\nwith marrow, like hollow bones. The observations of the author,\r\nhowever, do not agree with these statements. The dental cavity does\r\nnot contain any fatty substance analogous to the marrow of bones. As\r\nto the above-mentioned membrane, Eustachius doubts its existence. The\r\nlarge hollow existing in children’s teeth contains, he says, a mucous\r\nsubstance, somewhat hard, and very smooth at its surface—almost like\r\na cuticle—but which has rather the appearance of a concretion than of\r\na membranous tissue. At any rate, adds Eustachius, if the substance\r\nalluded to is made to dry up in the shade, it acquires an appearance\r\nnot unlike that of a membrane. It is certain, however, that at an early\r\nage the substance contained in the dental cavity does not adhere to\r\nthe walls of the latter after the manner of a periosteum, but is found\r\nin simple contact with the same, and can, therefore, be separated from\r\nthem with the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nAs years pass by, the dental cavity becomes narrower and narrower,\r\nbecause the substance contained inside the tooth gradually becomes\r\nossified at the surface, adhering to the dental scale previously\r\nformed, in the very same manner as the internal or woody part of a tree\r\nadheres to the bark. Of the two hard substances which make up a tooth,\r\nthe outer one is white, tense, and dense, like marble, the underlying\r\none, instead, is somewhat dark, rough, and less compact. To observe\r\naccurately the above-mentioned facts, the author advises searching for\r\nthem, first, in the molar teeth of the ox or the ram, and then in human\r\nteeth, and likewise, first in children or in recently born animals, and\r\nthen in adults.\r\n\r\nChapters XIX and XX are, comparatively speaking, of little importance.\r\nIn the former the author undertakes especially to examine the opinions\r\nof Galen on dental bloodvessels and nerves, and discusses whether\r\nit were known to him that these vessels and nerves penetrate into\r\nthe internal part of the teeth. In the latter, Eustachius speaks of\r\nthe great difficulties that are encountered in dissecting dental\r\nbloodvessels and nerves, and reproves those who, by inaccurate\r\nillustrative figures, convey the erroneous idea that these parts are\r\nvery clearly and easily observable.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXI the author goes on to speak of the best mode of\r\nproceeding in order to make successful observation of the small nerves\r\nand vessels going to the roots of the teeth. These researches are much\r\nmore easily made in large animals than in man; and therefore such\r\nthings as cannot be observed well in the latter must be studied in the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it is necessary to dissect the lower jaw; and\r\nafter having done so several times, with all the accuracy required in\r\nmaking researches of this kind, one may proceed to study the dental\r\nnerves and vessels of the upper jaw, which is much more difficult.\r\nHaving opened up the inside of the lower jaw, one observes a cavity\r\nfull of marrow, and within this a nerve enclosed entirely in its own\r\nsheath. Having removed the marrow, and opened the sheath lengthwise,\r\none perceives that the nerve therein enclosed is constituted (analogous\r\nto what may be observed in the large nerves of the limbs) by several\r\nnervous strings, and that among these runs a comparatively large\r\nartery, besides small vascular branches of minor importance. If one\r\nthen removes the sheath from the bone, together with the nerve and the\r\nvessels contained in it, raising it very gently, one sees, issuing\r\ntherefrom, some very slender fibers, on the nature of which it is,\r\nhowever, difficult to pronounce; and, considering their thinness, one\r\ncan hardly conceive that they are composed of three different elements,\r\nthat is, of small nervous, arterial, and venous twigs. At any rate,\r\nthe author admits that this may be so. On arriving at the lesser\r\nteeth, the nerve and the artery that accompanies it divide into two\r\nbranches, one of which traverses the opening presented by the bone at\r\nthat point (_mental foramen_), and is destined to the lower lip; the\r\nother directs its course toward the roots of the incisors. The small\r\ntwigs which penetrate into the roots of the incisor and canine teeth\r\nare less slender than those which enter the roots of the molars, and\r\nare easily to be seen not only in large animals, but also in man. If\r\nthe tooth of an ox or that of a ram be split through the middle, the\r\nmucous substance contained in the interior is seen to be traversed\r\nby small bloodvessels; and one perceives, besides, certain fibers,\r\nwhich are probably nerves. All these things, says Eustachius, I have\r\nobserved many times in different animals, in some cases more, in others\r\nless distinctly. But it is an exceedingly difficult thing to follow\r\nthe single twigs, of which we have spoken, from their origin to their\r\ninsertion, or, _vice versa_, from their insertion to their origin. And\r\nso, adds the great anatomist, being able to observe but a small part\r\nof the things I should like to see, I find myself compelled, in my\r\nperplexity, to supply by the aid of ratiocination the deficiency of\r\nthe senses. I therefore maintain that the interior part of a tooth is\r\nsusceptible of experiencing pain accompanied by a feeling of pulsation\r\n(a fact already mentioned by Galen), because a nerve and an artery\r\npenetrate into it. In the ox the penetration of bloodvessels into the\r\nroots of the teeth can be more readily ascertained than in man. It may\r\nbe admitted that the same occurs in the human teeth; and this, for the\r\nreasons already given, and also because only by admitting the existence\r\nof an artery within the cavity of the tooth can be explained the\r\ncopious flow of florid red blood from a decayed tooth, which has, in\r\nsome cases, been known to imperil the life of a patient. And I myself,\r\nsays Eustachius, have observed with my own eyes an accident of this\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nThe author then passes on to speak of the eruption of the teeth,[292]\r\nbut the data with which he furnishes us are neither very precise nor\r\nvery exact.\r\n\r\nEustachius, without declaring himself for or against it, cites, in\r\nthis chapter, the opinion of those who believe in the possibility of a\r\nthird dentition in old people. He returns to this subject in the last\r\nchapter but one of his book, which treats of dental anomalies: “Ali,”\r\nsays he, “testifies to old persons having had all their teeth renewed.\r\nThis has been derided as chimerical by medical men of later date, or at\r\nleast only admitted under the condition that such teeth be of a nature\r\ncompletely different from the first.”\r\n\r\nOur teeth, says the author, grow old together with us, and toward the\r\nterm of life they abandon us, a fact which also distinguishes them\r\nfrom the other bones. When, however, it occurs, through illness, that\r\nthe teeth are extracted or fall out spontaneously before the period of\r\nold age, the alveoli become filled up with a bony substance; and in\r\naddition the two osseous scales of the maxillary bones approach one\r\nanother and unite together in such a manner as to form a sharp margin,\r\nevery vestige of a cavity being obliterated.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the nutrition and growth of the teeth,[293] Eustachius says\r\nthat—given the existence of the dental nerves and bloodvessels—it is\r\nnot difficult to explain how the teeth are nourished, grow, live, and\r\nfeel. He therefore rejects the opinion of those who held that the teeth\r\nof the lower jaw derived their nourishment from the marrow contained\r\nwithin this bone, and that those of the upper jaw received it from a\r\nhumorous substance similar to marrow, existing in the large cavity\r\nof the upper maxillary bone. Against the supporters of this opinion\r\nEustachius raises, among others, the following objections, viz., that\r\nthe marrow of the inferior jaw does not in any way touch the teeth,\r\nso that such a mode of nourishment cannot be imagined, and that it is\r\ncompletely erroneous that the large cavity of the upper maxillary bone\r\ncontains a humor similar to marrow. This passage of Eustachius’ book\r\ngives clear evidence that he was well acquainted with the maxillary\r\nsinus, described a century later by the English anatomist, Highmore,\r\nwho gave it his name. The existence of this cavity was, besides,\r\nalready known before the time of Eustachius.\r\n\r\nThe author also says that those who believe that the internal cavity of\r\nthe teeth contains marrow, and that this serves to nourish them, are\r\ngrossly deceived.\r\n\r\nIn the same chapter, Eustachius confutes an opinion, at that time\r\ngenerally diffused and put forward for the first time by Aristotle,\r\nviz., that the teeth grow throughout a whole lifetime. In the senile\r\nage, he says, the teeth become impaired still earlier than the other\r\norgans. They become thinner by deficiency of nourishment, and, at the\r\nsame time, discolored; the incisors and canines, as they waste away,\r\ncome to be also less sharp than they were; and the molars, losing their\r\ntubercles or cups, become levelled down and smooth. If, notwithstanding\r\nthe evident wearing out of the teeth, they seem sometimes to grow\r\nlonger, this appearance is not to be trusted, for it happens not\r\nunfrequently that the teeth appear to have grown longer simply by\r\natrophy of the gums, or also because some humor or other morbid\r\nsubstance pushes them outward.\r\n\r\nAs to the sensibility of the teeth,[294] Eustachius is of the opinion\r\nthat these organs possess, besides the sensibility to pain, two other\r\nspecies of sensibility; for, following the ideas of Galen, he also\r\nholds that the teeth together with the tongue partake in the sense\r\nof taste; and he further considers the disagreeable sensation known\r\nas _setting on edge of the teeth_, as a species of tactile sensation\r\npeculiar to these organs.\r\n\r\nBut in which part of the tooth does the faculty of feeling reside?\r\n\r\nAmong the authors previous to, or contemporaries of, Eustachius, some\r\naffirmed that the sensibility of the tooth resides in the pellicle\r\nwhich lines its inside cavity, others in the membrane which, like\r\nperiosteum, clothes the root of the tooth, others in both these parts.\r\nEustachius does not show himself more partial to the one than the other\r\nof these opinions; he is, however, firmly persuaded that the hard\r\nsubstance of the tooth is also endowed with sensibility. Though it is\r\nnot easy to explain how this may be, he considers it probable that\r\nthe nerve, fraying itself out inside of the tooth in minute filaments\r\nat the time when the substance of the tooth is still soft and mucous,\r\nintermixes intimately with it, thus communicating to it the faculty of\r\nfeeling, which then persists in it, even after the ossification of the\r\ntooth. Such an hypothesis is certainly worthy of the lofty intellect of\r\nEustachius, and has in itself, so it seems to me, something of truth.\r\n\r\nIn the two following chapters,[295] the author speaks in a masterly and\r\nadmirable manner of the functions of the teeth and of their utility.\r\n\r\nAmong many other true and interesting observations, he remarks that by\r\nthe loss of their teeth even the most powerful dogs become cowards.\r\n\r\nBesides what concerns the human teeth, excellent notions of comparative\r\nanatomy, above all in what regards the monkey, the dog, and the\r\nruminants, are to be found in this little but most precious book of\r\nEustachius.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, says he, are not equally hard in all animals, and many\r\nancient authors have affirmed that ferocious animals have much harder\r\nteeth than tame ones.\r\n\r\nChapter XXIX, relating to dental anomalies, is one of the most\r\ninteresting. We here quote the greater part of it.\r\n\r\n“Some historians relate that Pyrrhus, King of Epirus, Eurifeus, of\r\nGreece, and many others, had, instead of teeth, a continuous bone,\r\nfurrowed by somewhat deep vertical lines, in no way different from what\r\none sees in the multiple molars of the goat. It has never happened\r\nto me, says Eustachius, to witness a similar union of all the teeth;\r\nI have, however, sometimes observed continuity between three or four\r\nmolars, precisely in the same manner as in sheep. It also once happened\r\nto me to observe in the case of an old man, a fellow citizen of mine,\r\nthat the teeth were covered up on every side by a hard and almost stony\r\nsubstance, and no longer exhibited any trace of separation, offering\r\ninstead the appearance of a single bone.”\r\n\r\n“One reads that Timarchus, of Cyprus, had two rows or series of teeth\r\nand Hercules three.”\r\n\r\nThe author never had any opportunity of observing any such anomalies;\r\nnotwithstanding, he refers to cases of the kind observed by other\r\nanatomists of his time, and, in a particular manner, to the case of a\r\ntriple dental series in a youth who died at the age of eighteen. As the\r\ntruth of the fact was testified to by highly respectable medical men,\r\nEustachius lends faith thereto. “Neither can it be said”—he adds—“that\r\nin the case we are speaking of the new teeth erupted from other sockets\r\nbefore the temporary ones were shed, for there would then have been\r\nonly a double and not a triple series; indeed, the series would not\r\neven have been double along all the line, but only along the line of\r\nthe temporary teeth; and besides this, the double series would not have\r\nbeen maintained up to eighteen years of age—the time of the death of\r\nthe subject—but only until the shedding of the deciduous teeth.”\r\n\r\n“That teeth are sometimes cut in the palate is a fact attested to by\r\nAlessandro de Benedetti and others. It has also occurred, within my own\r\nexperience, to observe this in the person of a Roman woman, who had a\r\ntooth in the roof of the mouth, near the opening which is in proximity\r\nto the incisors,[296] and at Gubbio there is, in the monastery of the\r\nTrinità, a nephew of the distinguished jurisconsult Girolamo Gabrielli,\r\nwho at the age of eighteen cut a tooth in the middle of the palate.”\r\n\r\n“Pliny and Solinus tell of individuals born with all their teeth. Other\r\nauthors, that Pheretes was without teeth all his life.”\r\n\r\n“I hold it to be a fable that some women lose a tooth for each child\r\nthey bear.”\r\n\r\n“In some cases it has happened that the falling out and renewal of the\r\nteeth has not taken place before the age of thirteen or fourteen. In\r\nother cases, the same teeth were shed and renewed twice, that is, once\r\nafter the seventh year, and again after the fourteenth year. It ought\r\nalso to be mentioned that in some young persons of twenty, the last\r\nmolar, or wisdom tooth, having been drawn, it was renewed during the\r\nsame year. Lastly, it is also to be noted that in strong and healthy\r\nyoung persons, one of the other molars being extracted, it is sometimes\r\nrenewed.”[297]\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter[298] the author alludes to some dental affections.\r\nIn referring to the fluxions to which teeth are subject, he says he\r\nhas observed more than one case in which such a quantity of matter\r\nresembling chalk was collected in the alveoli, that these gradually\r\nbeing filled thereby, all the teeth became loosened and dropped out\r\nlittle by little.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of dental diseases requiring surgical intervention, the author\r\nremarks that dental surgery was, in his days, a most abject calling,\r\nnotwithstanding its having had, according to Cicero, a very high\r\ninitiator—Æsculapius, the god of medicine.\r\n\r\nAMBROISE PARÉ. Whilst the anatomy of the dental system was illustrated\r\nby the researches of Fallopius and Eustachius, the celebrated French\r\nsurgeon Ambroise Paré was contributing in the highest degree to the\r\nprogress of practical dentistry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ambroise Paré.]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Paré (Latinized Paræus) was born at Bourg-Hersent in the year\r\n1517. His father and one of his brothers were box-makers; another\r\nbrother was a barber. We have no very precise information about the\r\nearly years of his life; so much is certain, however, that Ambroise\r\nParé did not enjoy any of those advantages deriving from a good\r\nliterary education, and after having received some instruction from a\r\nchaplain, whose disciple and servant he was at one and the same time,\r\nhe was bound over as apprentice to a barber, who also taught him the\r\nart of bleeding. Toward the age of sixteen we find him in Paris in\r\nthe employ of a _chirurgien-barbier_. After this he practised minor\r\nsurgery for some years in the Hôtel-Dieu. But having undertaken the\r\nstudy of surgery without literary preparation and without any knowledge\r\nof Latin, he was obliged, especially for the latter reason, to contend\r\nwith great difficulties, so that, although he had acquired in a few\r\nyears sufficient practice in surgery to enable him to pass from the\r\nHôtel-Dieu to the sanitary service of the French army, it was only in\r\n1554, that is, at thirty-seven years of age, that he was permitted to\r\ntake the examination required for becoming a member of the College\r\nof Surgeons of Paris. Within the short space of five months he was\r\nsuccessively named Bachelor, Licentiate, and Doctor in Surgery. His\r\nreputation, which had already become extraordinary even before he had\r\nany academic degree, procured him introduction to the Court of France\r\nas surgeon in ordinary. In 1562 he became chief surgeon to the Court\r\nand occupied this post under the reigns of Charles IX and Henri III.\r\nAmbroise Paré was a Protestant, and it is said that in the massacre of\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s night, he owed his escape to the king, Charles IX,\r\nwho, to save his life, hid him in his wardrobe. He died full of honors,\r\nin the year 1592.\r\n\r\nIn his works this great surgeon treats the subject of dental maladies\r\nand their cure very thoroughly; this may be in part attributed to the\r\ncircumstance of his having first been simply a barber (and, therefore,\r\nalso a tooth-puller) and afterward a surgeon-barber, which placed him\r\nin very favorable conditions for acquiring vast experience in the\r\npractice of dentistry.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter II, Book IV, of his works,[299] Ambroise Paré speaks of the\r\nanatomy and physiology of the teeth. It must, however, be confessed\r\nthat Vesalius and, still more so, Eustachius treat of dental anatomy\r\nwith much more exactness than he does.\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the incisors and the canines, he says that the\r\nten upper molars generally have three roots, and very often four,\r\nwhilst the ten lower ones have only three; this is because the lower\r\njaw is harder than the upper, and also because the lower molars,\r\n_estant assises sur la racine, et non suspendues, comme celles de la\r\nmandibule d’en haut, n’avoient besoin de tant de racines pour leur\r\nstabilité asseurance_.[300]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Paré, too, admits that the teeth grow throughout the whole\r\nlifetime, and that the wearing away consequent on reciprocal friction\r\nand mastication is compensated in this way.\r\n\r\nGalen had already affirmed, and Ambroise Paré also held erroneously,\r\nthat the exquisite sensibility of the teeth aids the sense of taste.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the development of the teeth, Ambroise Paré says only\r\nthat they are already solid and osseous before birth, he himself\r\nhaving observed this in dissecting the jaws of a child who had died\r\nimmediately after birth.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VII, Book XIII,[301] Paré treats of fracture of the lower\r\njaw. The method of cure he proposes is altogether identical with that\r\nof Celsus. With regard to the teeth, he says that “_si elles sont\r\ndivisées, ebranlées, ou separées hors de leurs alvéoles ou petites\r\ncavités, elles doivent estre reduites en leurs places et seront liées\r\net attachées contre celles qui sont fermes, avecques un fil d’or ou\r\nd’argent, ou de lin. Et les y faut tenir jusques à ce qu’elles soient\r\nbien affermies, et le callus soient refait et rendu solide._”[302]\r\n\r\nToothache, says Paré,[303] is, of all others, the most atrocious pain\r\nthat can torment a man without being followed by death. It depends, in\r\nmany cases, on a humorous fluxion of a hot or cold nature which flows\r\ninto the alveolus, forcing the tooth outward, loosening it, and causing\r\nthe patient so much pain on the slightest pressure being exercised on\r\nit, that he cannot dare to bite with it in the least. If, however, the\r\ntooth is corroded, hollowed out, or pierced to the root, the pain is so\r\nstrong, when the patient drinks—particularly if the liquid is cold—that\r\nhe seems to have had a stab with a stiletto inside the tooth.\r\n\r\nIf the pain is acute and pungent, like that produced by needles\r\nbeing thrust into the diseased tooth; if the patient complains of a\r\nstrong pulsation at the root of the tooth, and in the temples; if the\r\napplication of cold remedies calms the pain, all these signs indicate\r\nthat the cause of the evil is heat. Instead, the cause of the pain may\r\nbe held to be cold when the patient complains of a great heaviness\r\nin the head, emits a quantity of saliva, and finds relief in the\r\napplication of hot remedies. In the treatment of toothache one must\r\nfulfil the following three indications:\r\n\r\n1. Regulate fittingly the mode of living.\r\n\r\n2. Evacuate or dissipate the morbid humors; this may be effected\r\nby various means, namely, by purgatives, by bleeding, by gingival\r\nscarification, by the application of leeches on the site of the pain,\r\nby cupping on the back of the neck, or on the shoulders.\r\n\r\n3. Applying in each single case the medicaments best adapted for\r\ncalming the pain.\r\n\r\nThe author here goes through a long enumeration of anti-odontalgic\r\nremedies that offer no particular interest, as they are not at all new.\r\n\r\nWhen a decayed tooth becomes the seat of excessive pain, and this does\r\nnot yield to any remedy, one must either have recourse to extraction or\r\ncauterize it; this can be done either with potential caustics—such as\r\noil of vitriol, aqua fortis—or with the actual cautery. By cauterizing,\r\nParé adds, one burns the nerve, thus rendering it incapable of again\r\nfeeling or causing pain.\r\n\r\nErosion or caries[304] is the effect of an acute and acrid humor, that\r\ncorrodes and perforates the teeth, often to their very roots. To combat\r\nthis morbid condition, even when it is not accompanied by pain, one\r\nmust also have recourse (besides general treatment) to cauterization\r\neither with oil of vitriol, with aqua fortis, or with a small actual\r\ncautery.\r\n\r\nIf, as often happens, that the seat of the erosion lies in such a\r\nmanner between two teeth as to make it impossible to apply caustics or\r\nother medicaments, one must file just sufficiently between the healthy\r\nand the corroded tooth to render the part accessible, taking care,\r\nhowever, to file more on the side of the affected tooth than on that of\r\nthe healthy one.\r\n\r\nThe file may be used, besides, to plane down a tooth that stands out\r\nabove the level of the others, and for similar purposes.\r\n\r\nIf one or more teeth have been shaken by a blow or a fall, or have come\r\nout of their alveoli altogether, the surgeon should not remove them,\r\nbut rather reduce them and bind to the neighboring teeth, that they may\r\nentirely reacquire their original firmness.\r\n\r\nIn allusion to this subject, Ambroise Paré refers to the case of a\r\nfriend of his, who having sustained, through a blow from the hilt of\r\na dagger, a fracture of the lower jaw with almost complete expulsion\r\nof three teeth from their alveoli, had the fracture reduced by him;\r\nafter replacing the teeth and binding them to the neighboring ones,\r\nhe prescribed astringent mouth washes and liquid or semiliquid\r\nnourishment, such as meat juice, _panada_, barley soup, jelly, and such\r\nlike. The patient was completely cured and able to masticate with the\r\nthree teeth as well as before.\r\n\r\nAlso in the case of extraction of a healthy instead of a diseased\r\ntooth, Paré recommends replacing it immediately and binding it to the\r\nneighboring ones, for, he says, by this means the tooth can take root\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the first author who speaks of replantation is\r\nAbulcasis, but to Ambroise Paré belongs the merit of having treated the\r\nsubject much more explicitly, and of having insisted on the utility\r\nof this operation, indeed, on the duty of carrying it out whenever it\r\nseems indicated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60\r\n\r\nDental files (Ambroise Paré).]\r\n\r\nFurther, he is the first to mention another very important operation,\r\nnamely, transplantation, albeit he himself had never performed it.\r\nThe case he refers to has become a generally known anecdote. We give\r\nit in his own words: “_Un homme digne d’estre creu m’a affirmé qu’une\r\nprincesse ayant fait arracher une dent, s’en fit remettre subit une\r\nautre d’une sienne demoiselle, laquelle se reprint, et quelque temps\r\naprès maschoit dessus comme sus celle qu’elle avoit fait arracher\r\nauparavant._”[305]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61\r\n\r\nOne of the pelicans used by Ambroise Paré.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62\r\n\r\nTwo other pelicans and a pair of curved pincers (Ambroise Paré).]\r\n\r\nAmbroise Paré has recourse to extraction when a tooth is the cause\r\nof very violent pain, or when the existence of a carious cavity and\r\nconcomitant putrefying processes render the breath fetid, and endanger\r\nthe healthy teeth in its vicinity. If the persistence of a deciduous\r\ntooth should cause the cutting of the corresponding permanent tooth\r\noutside the line of the dental arch, thus giving rise to deformity,\r\nParé advises laying bare and then extracting the deciduous tooth;\r\nfor after this the new tooth may be pressed toward the point before\r\noccupied by the other, until it assumes its natural position.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when a tooth is too firmly planted, one prefers, says Paré,\r\ninstead of extracting it, to break off the crown for the purpose\r\nof being able to act directly on the dental nerve with appropriate\r\nremedies, or to destroy the sensibility of the nerve entirely, by\r\ncauterization. This unreasonable and reprehensible method of cure is\r\nalso quoted, under the denomination of _deschapellement_, by another\r\nFrench author, a contemporary of Paré—Urbain Hemard—who observes,\r\nhowever, that one rarely had recourse to it; for the pain and shock\r\nwhich are caused by this operation are not less than those caused by\r\nextraction.\r\n\r\nIt very often happens that the patient cannot indicate exactly which\r\ntooth it is that gives him pain, his sufferings being so acute as to\r\nappear spread over a great part of the jaw. One cannot, therefore,\r\ntrust too much to the indications given by the patient as to the point\r\nof departure of the pain, and must take care not to extract a healthy\r\ninstead of a diseased tooth.\r\n\r\nThe extraction of a tooth should not be carried out with too much\r\nviolence, as one risks producing luxation of the jaw or concussion\r\nof the brain and the eyes, or even bringing away a portion of the\r\njaw together with the tooth (the author himself has observed this in\r\nseveral cases), not to speak of other serious accidents which may\r\nsupervene, as, for example, fever, apostema, abundant hemorrhage, and\r\neven death.\r\n\r\nIn extracting a tooth it is necessary to place the patient on a very\r\nlow seat, or even on the ground, with his head between the legs of the\r\noperator.[306] After having laid the tooth bare sufficiently, if one\r\nsees that it is very loose, one may push it out of its socket with\r\na _poussoir_, that is, with a trifid lever. But if the tooth is too\r\nfirmly rooted to be extracted with this instrument, one must make use\r\nof curved pincers, or else one may have recourse to a pelican. The\r\nauthor notes, however, that much skill is required in using this latter\r\ninstrument, for otherwise it will almost certainly happen that several\r\ngood teeth will be knocked out, instead of the one intended to be\r\nextracted. In proof of this, he relates the following anecdote, which\r\nwe relate in the words of the author, that it may not lose anything of\r\nits quaint originality:\r\n\r\n“Je veux icy reciter une histoire d’un maistre barbier, demeurant à\r\nOrleans, nommé maistre François Loüis, lequel avoit par dessus tous,\r\nl’honneur de bien arracher une dent, de façon que tous les samedis\r\nplusieurs paysans ayans mal aux dents venoient vers luy pour les\r\nfaire arracher, ce qu’il faisait fort dextrement avec un polican,\r\net lorsqu’il avoit fait, le jettoit sus un ais en sa boutique. Or\r\navoit-il un serviteur nouveau, Picard, grand et fort, qui desiroit\r\ntirer les dents à la mode de son maistre. Arriva cependant que ledit\r\nFrançois Louys disnoit, un villageois, requerant qu’on luy arrachait\r\nune dent, ce Picard print l’instrument de son maistre et s’essaya faire\r\ncomme luy; mais en lieu d’oster la mauvaise dent au pauvre villageois,\r\nluy en poussa et arracha trois bonnes. Et sentant une douleur extrème,\r\net voyont trois dents hors de sa bouche, commença à crier contre le\r\nPicard; lequel pour le faire taire luy dit qu’il ne dist mot, et qu’il\r\nne criast si haut, attendu que si le maistre venoit il luy feroit payer\r\nles trois dent pour une. Donc le maistre oyant tel bruit, sortit hors\r\nde table pour sçavoir la cause et raison de leur noise et contestation;\r\nmais le pauvre paysan redoutant les menaces du Picard, et encore apres\r\navoir enduré telle douleur qu’on ne luy fist payer triplement la\r\npeine dudit Picard, se tent, n’osant declarer audit maistre ce beau\r\nchef d’œuvre; et ainsi le pauvre badaud de village s’en alla quitte;\r\net pour une dent qu’il pensoit faire arracher, en remporta trois en sa\r\nbourse, et celle qui luy causoit le mal en sa bouche.”[307] Paré adds\r\nin conclusion: “Partant je conseille à ceux qui voudront faire arracher\r\nles dents, qu’ils aillent aux vieux dentateurs, et non aux jeunes qui\r\nn’auront encore reconneu leurs fautes.”[308]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63\r\n\r\nTwo gum lancets and a trifid lever called “poussoir” (Ambroise Paré).]\r\n\r\nBut let us now return to our subject. After the extraction of a tooth,\r\nit is necessary—says Paré—to leave the wound to bleed freely, so that\r\nthe part may get rid of the morbid humors; then the gums and the\r\nalveolus must be pressed, on both sides, with the fingers, to readjust\r\nthe socket, which will have been widened and sometimes even broken in\r\nextracting the tooth. After this, the patient should rinse his mouth\r\nwith oxycrate; and when the weather is cold and windy, the patient\r\nshould take care to avoid fluxion in the other teeth.\r\n\r\nThe following chapter speaks, “_de la limosité ou rouillure des dents,\r\net de la manière de les conserver_.”\r\n\r\nAfter meals the mouth must be rinsed with water and wine, or with\r\nwater with a little vinegar added to it, and the teeth cleaned from\r\nall residues of food, so that their putrefying may not spoil the teeth\r\nand make the breath fetid. An earthy yellowish substance, like rust,\r\noften forms on the teeth from want of cleanliness and also when they\r\nare not used to masticate; this substance corrodes the teeth, just\r\nas rust corrodes iron. It is necessary to remove this substance, by\r\nscraping the teeth with small instruments suitable for the purpose, and\r\nthen the teeth themselves must be rubbed with a little aqua fortis and\r\naqua vitæ mixed together, to take away what the instruments have not\r\nbeen able to remove. In order to preserve the teeth it is necessary,\r\nbesides, to rub the teeth frequently with appropriate dentifrices.\r\nAmong these the author mentions simple bread crust, burnt and reduced\r\nto powder.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter III of Book XVII he speaks of artificial teeth. Sometimes,\r\nsays Paré, by the effect of a blow, the front teeth are lost; this\r\nnot only constitutes a deformity, but is also the cause of defects\r\nof speech. Therefore, after the necessary treatment, when the gums\r\nare hardened, the lost teeth must be substituted with artificial ones\r\nmade out of bone, ivory, or the teeth of the _Rohart_,[309] which are\r\nexcellent for this purpose; and the artificial teeth must be tied to\r\nthe neighboring ones with gold or silver wire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64\r\n\r\nThe palatine obturator with sponge of Ambroise Paré.]\r\n\r\nChapter IV of the same book is most important, for palatal obturators\r\nare therein spoken of for the first time. “Sometimes a portion of the\r\nbone of the palate is destroyed by the shot of an arquebus, or by some\r\nother wound or by a syphilitic ulcer (_par ulcère de verole_), the\r\npatients being thereby disabled from properly pronouncing words and\r\nfrom making themselves understood. To repair this defect we have found\r\nan expedient through the help and ministry of our art. It consists\r\nin the application of an instrument somewhat larger than the palatal\r\nperforation; this is made of gold or silver, of about the thickness of\r\na crown (coin), and has the form of a vaulted roof, to which a sponge\r\nis attached; when introduced into the aperture, the sponge, absorbing\r\nthe humidity natural to such parts, will very soon swell up, and thus\r\nthe instrument is held firm. In this way, words are better pronounced.”\r\n\r\nBesides the above instrument, the author gives us the figure of another\r\ninstrument, _sans esponge_ (without sponge), which, taken altogether,\r\nis like a large cuff button. The small part, designed to be introduced\r\ninto the aperture of the palate, can be made to turn round from below,\r\nby means of a small pair of pincers, so as to fix the obturator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65\r\n\r\nParé’s palatine obturator without sponge.]\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter of Book XVIII, first dentition and the treatment\r\nrequired during this period are spoken of. The cutting of teeth, says\r\nParé, is accompanied by pain, itching, and pricking of the gums; often,\r\nas well by diarrhea, fever, epileptic convulsions, which sometimes end\r\nfatally. The symptoms by which it may be known that teeth are about\r\nto come forth are as follows: The wet-nurse feels the mouth of the\r\nsuckling infant to be hotter than usual; the gums are swollen; the\r\nchild is restless, crying often and sleeping but little; it emits a\r\nquantity of saliva from the mouth, and frequently puts its fingers in\r\nits mouth, trying to rub its gums, and soothe, in this way, the pain\r\nand itching which it feels. It is then necessary to treat the nurse as\r\nif she had fever, and the infant should be suckled less than usual;\r\nsome cooling and thirst quenching drinks should be given to it—for a\r\nchild in such conditions suffers from intense thirst; the nurse should\r\noften rub the gums of the little patient with softening and soothing\r\nsubstances, as, for example, oil of sweet almonds, fresh butter, honey,\r\nor mucilage made from the seeds of the fleawort or of the quince;\r\nthe brains of a hare (these may be roasted or boiled) have not only\r\na very soothing action, but also, according to a very ancient belief\r\nshared by Paré, possess the occult property of aiding the cutting of\r\nthe teeth. But oftentimes, neither these nor other remedies are of any\r\nuse, because the gums are too hard and the teeth cannot cut their way\r\nthrough at all; the tension of the gums then produces very violent\r\npain, fever, and other accidents, death even supervening in some cases.\r\nThe author, therefore, advises lancing the gums deeply, just above the\r\ntooth which ought to appear, thus opening it a way, that it may more\r\neasily come out. He relates that he has performed this operation on his\r\nown children in the presence of many medical authorities.\r\n\r\nAlmost as if to show the high value of this operative procedure, Paré\r\ntells the case of a child, the son of the Duke of Nevers, who died\r\nat the age of about eight months without having cut any teeth. He,\r\ntogether with other doctors, was invited to carry out an autopsy. No\r\nlesion whatever was found sufficient to cause death, but the gums were\r\nvery hard, thick, and swollen; an incision into them showed that\r\nthe teeth were ready to come out, if only their eruption had been\r\nfacilitated by lancing at the right time. Paré and the other doctors\r\nwere of the unanimous opinion that death was caused solely by the\r\nimpossibility of cutting the teeth on account of the hardness of the\r\ngums.\r\n\r\nAmong the many strange cases given in Book XIX (_Des monstres et\r\nprodiges_), Paré also speaks—trusting to the word of Alexander\r\nBenedetti—of the case of a woman, who, after the complete loss of her\r\nteeth caused by age, cut them all again at eighty years of age.\r\n\r\nAlthough Paré treats so amply and with such competence all that\r\nconcerns dental diseases and their cure, he does not make the least\r\nallusion to the stopping of teeth, beyond recommending, as had already\r\nbeen done by Celsus, that when a tooth that is to be extracted shows a\r\nlarge cavity, the latter should be well filled with linen or lead, so\r\nthat the tooth be not fractured under the pressure of the instrument\r\nand so leave the root behind in the alveolus.\r\n\r\nA century before Ambroise Paré, Giovanni d’Arcoli had already mentioned\r\nthe filling of teeth with gold leaf, and, as we have seen already,\r\nthere is very good reason to believe that the practice of this\r\noperation dated back to a still earlier period. How is it, then, that\r\nthe illustrious French surgeon does not say a word about this? Very\r\nprobably stoppings were not at all in use among French _dentateurs_ and\r\nperhaps, even in Italy, this operation was only rarely carried out.\r\n\r\nJACQUES HOULLIER (1498 to 1562), a celebrated French physician and\r\nsurgeon, also known under the Latinized name of Jacobus Hollerius,\r\nwas the first to stand out, although timidly, against the theory of\r\ndental worms. He did not decidedly deny their existence, this having\r\nbeen affirmed by so many illustrious writers; he, however, speaks of\r\nthem as if the point were a doubtful one: “_It is said_ that worms are\r\ngenerated in the teeth, which corrode the teeth themselves, and produce\r\na pain which is not very violent and causes itching with little or no\r\nsalivation (_vermes ajunt subnasci dentibus, et hos corrodere, à quibus\r\ndolor non ita fortis, pruriginosus, nulla aut pauca salivatio_).”\r\n\r\nBut even while putting in doubt the existence of dental worms, he\r\nbelieves it his duty to enumerate the various remedies, recommended for\r\ntheir destruction. As to fumigations with the seeds of the hyoscyamus,\r\nHoullier, declares that what is believed by the common people, and\r\nwhat has been written by doctors of antiquity about worms being killed\r\nand seen to fall from the teeth by the effect of these fumigations, is\r\nall nonsense. In fact, he says, when the seeds of the hyoscyamus are\r\nburnt there fly away from them what appear to be little worms, even\r\nif the fumes do not reach the worm-eaten tooth. (_Quod autem vulgus\r\nsibi persuadet, et ab antiquis medicis scriptum est de suffumigio è\r\nsemine hyoscyami, videtur fabulosum. Nam inde ajunt manifeste vermes\r\nexcidere. Re vera, incenso semine, evolant tanqua vermiculi, etiam si\r\nnon attingit fumus vermiculosum dentem._)\r\n\r\nApart from this, in the works of Houllier, nothing is found that is\r\nof interest for the history of dentistry. He repeats several errors\r\nand prejudices of the ancients; he says, for example, that men have\r\nordinarily thirty-two teeth, women, twenty-eight; and he, too, believes\r\nin the expulsive virtues of the fat of green frogs when applied to a\r\ntooth (_adeps ranæ viridis dentem depellit_).\r\n\r\nHoullier does not contribute in any way to dental therapeutics, he only\r\nenumerates the methods of cure recommended by preceding authors.[310]\r\n\r\nVOLCHERUS COITER (1534 to 1600), of Gröningen, an ardent student of\r\nanatomy, and a pupil of Fallopius, Eustachius, and Aranzio, studied\r\nwith great attention the development of bones, dissecting many fetuses\r\nand children of various ages for that purpose. He clearly states his\r\nopinion that the teeth are not bones, since they do not pass, like the\r\nlatter, through the cartilaginous stage, but are derived instead from a\r\nmucous substance.[311]\r\n\r\nJOHANN JACOB WECKER, a doctor of Colmar, published in 1576 a valuable\r\nmedical work composed of synoptical tables, in which is briefly\r\nsummarized the best of what had been written by preceding Greek, Latin,\r\nand Arabic authors.\r\n\r\nOne gathers from this author that at the time in which he wrote it\r\nwas considered an excellent preservative against the plague to rub\r\nthe teeth with theriac, mithridate, angelica, and zedoary. From this\r\nit may be perceived that even in those days doctors had understood\r\nthe importance of the cleanliness and disinfection of the mouth as a\r\nprophylactic against infective diseases.\r\n\r\nIn the above-mentioned book may be found a sufficiently complete\r\nexposition of dental therapeutics of that and of the preceding periods.\r\nThere is nothing, however, which is not already known to us from our\r\nexamination of the earlier writers. Worthy of notice is the information\r\nthat, among other things, to facilitate the cutting of teeth rubbing\r\nthe jaws with turpentine was recommended at that time.[312]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Volcherus Coiter.]\r\n\r\nDONATO ANTONIO OF ALTOMARE, a Neapolitan physician and philosopher,\r\ndedicated a long chapter of his _Ars medica_[313] to the subject of\r\ndental pains and their treatment. He classifies these pains with great\r\naccuracy, taking into account their seat and causes, and pointing\r\nout in each single case the method of cure to be followed according\r\nto the warm, cold, dry, or humid nature of the pain. In what he says,\r\nhowever, we do not find anything new.\r\n\r\nGIULIO CESARE ARANZIO (1530 to 1589), a celebrated surgeon and\r\nanatomist of Bologna, in which city he taught from the age of\r\ntwenty-six years until his death, is of the opinion that parulides—that\r\nis to say, inflammations or abscesses of the gums—and epulides—that\r\nis fleshy excrescences of the same—are usually caused by caries or\r\nputrescence of the teeth; but that in certain individuals, from\r\na peculiar weakness of the gums, these are easily attacked by\r\ninflammation when the wind is in the south.\r\n\r\nIn the case of parulides, to soothe the pain and to accelerate the\r\nsuppurative process, emollient substances should be used; afterward it\r\nis necessary to open the abscess with a lancet, to wash the mouth with\r\nmulse, and to aid the process of cicatrization by using syrup of roses.\r\n\r\nAs to epulides, these must be made to disappear, by sprinkling the\r\ntumor with the powder of gall-nuts, or by moistening them frequently\r\nwith a decoction of gall-nuts, or with sulphur water. But if they\r\ndo not yield to these remedies, and are the cause of functional\r\ndisturbances, the surest and most prudent method of cure would be the\r\nuse of the red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nGIOVANNI ANDREA DELLA CROCE, a celebrated Venetian physician and\r\nsurgeon, was the author of a most valuable treatise on surgery, which\r\nwas published first in Latin (_Chirurgiæ universalis opus absolutum_,\r\nVenetitiis, 1573), and then in Italian under the title of _Chirurgia\r\nuniversale e perfetta_, Venezia, 1583. According to this author, dental\r\nfistulæ are more common to the lower jaw than to the upper one. To\r\ncure these fistulæ, it is necessary to extract the diseased teeth from\r\nwhich they originate, even should they ache but little or not at all.\r\nTo confirm this, he relates in full a very interesting case of a dental\r\nfistula, that he cured by the extraction of a tooth which hardly ached\r\nat all.\r\n\r\nFlajani[314] chose to see in this case a precocious example of the\r\nopening of Highmore’s antrum through the alveolus. But the description\r\ngiven by Andrea della Croce of his case does not at all warrant this\r\nsupposition.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his book Andrea della Croce gives us the figures of many\r\ndental instruments, which have, however, nothing new about them.\r\n\r\nGEROLAMO CAPIVACCI, of Padua, repeats the advice (already given by\r\npreceding authors) to avoid, in eating and drinking, the rapid changes\r\nfrom heat to cold, and _vice versa_, since, says he, nature does not\r\ntolerate these rough changes.[315] In the mercurial treatment of\r\nsyphilis,[316] he recommends the patient, as soon as the action of the\r\nremedy manifests itself in the oral cavity, to keep a piece of gold in\r\nhis mouth, that the mercury, on account of its particular affinity,\r\nmay unite with the gold and the harmful effects of this strange remedy\r\non the mouth may be thus avoided. A strange method of curing mercurial\r\nstomatitis!\r\n\r\nJOHANN SCHENCK VON GRAFENBERG (1530 to 1598), a celebrated doctor of\r\nFreyburg-in-Breisgau, has left us, in his _Observationes medicæ_, a\r\nvery rich and interesting collection of clinical cases. In this work he\r\nrefers to many observations upon dental diseases by earlier authors,\r\nwhich, however, have already been noted by us in their time and place.\r\nAmong other things, Schenck von Grafenberg relates that Cardanus\r\nwas able, more than twenty times, to calm a violent toothache which\r\ntormented him by lightly pressing the sick tooth between the thumb and\r\nindex finger of his left hand.\r\n\r\nPETER FOREEST (1522 to 1597), a very famous Dutch doctor of Alkmaar,\r\nrepeats the very old error—already in decisive terms denied by Andreas\r\nVesalius—that women have only twenty-eight teeth, whilst men usually\r\nhave thirty-two. To the two central incisors he gives the name of\r\n_columellares_. Sugar and all sweet things, says this author, are\r\nvery harmful to the teeth, and he gives as a proof the fact that\r\napothecaries have, in general, very bad teeth, on account of the\r\nfrequency with which they taste syrups and the like. Perhaps things are\r\nnow changed, since I am not aware that chemists in our days are to be\r\ndistinguished by the bad state of their teeth!\r\n\r\nIn regard to toothache, Foreest records an important observation\r\nwhich he had made on himself; an aching tooth which a surgeon had not\r\nsucceeded in extracting, but which was simply loosened, ceased, without\r\nanything else being done, from giving him pain, and in a short while\r\nbecame firm again, and he continued to use this tooth for about five\r\nyears. However, on a renewal of the pain he was obliged at last to have\r\nit extracted. On the strength of this observation, the author believes\r\nthat in certain appropriate cases, recourse may be had to the luxation\r\nof a tooth, rather than to its extraction to obtain a cessation of\r\ntoothache.\r\n\r\nThis method of cure had already been advised by a still earlier writer,\r\nthat is, by Avicenna. When a subluxation produces the rupture of the\r\ndental nerve, this, in its results is equivalent to a replantation.\r\n\r\nForeest is the first to speak of the violent inflammation of the gums\r\nand of the whole mouth, caused by the application of artificial teeth\r\nof ivory fixed in their place with gold wire. This cannot at all\r\nastonish us when we consider how imperfectly, in those days, dental\r\nprosthesis was carried out and how the immobility of the artificial\r\npieces, caused them to be a source of permanent irritation to the\r\nneighboring parts, especially on account of the difficulty met with in\r\ngiving proper care to cleanliness. He, therefore, entirely rejects the\r\napplication of artificial teeth. He is likewise but little inclined\r\nto the use of the pelican, it being very easy to break the teeth with\r\nit, and, instead, he recommends the use, whenever it be possible, of\r\nanother instrument which he calls _pes bovinus_.\r\n\r\nForeest relates several cases of dental fistulæ which he had cured by\r\nthe extraction of the faulty teeth. In one of these cases, observed in\r\na lady, the fistula had opened between the nose and the cheek, so that\r\na malady of the upper jaw was feared (and, in fact, as William Sprengel\r\nobserves, it is not improbable that this was a case of affection of\r\nHighmore’s antrum); he obtained a complete cure in a short time by the\r\nextraction of a diseased tooth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Peter Foreest, the existence of dental worms is as certain\r\nas is that of intestinal, auricular, and other worms. Even on the\r\npretended efficacy of remedies, capable of making the teeth fall out\r\nwithout pain, he does not throw the slightest doubt.\r\n\r\nForeest attributes to his master, Benedictus of Faenza, the merit of\r\nhaving introduced into therapeutics the trephining of teeth for the\r\ncure of certain violent pains not accompanied by any external lesion\r\nof the tooth. We know, however, that the invention of this operation\r\ndates back to Archigenes. Benedictus trephined the tooth with a very\r\nfine drill (_stylo vel terebello subtilissimo_) and then filled it with\r\ntheriac, using, likewise, as occasion required, other remedies.\r\n\r\nTo demonstrate the propriety and the necessity of laying bare the neck\r\nof the tooth before extracting it, he relates a case in which fracture\r\nof the jaw was the result of having neglected this precaution.\r\n\r\nAmong the sundry causes of the looseness of teeth, he mentions the\r\nsoftening of the dental nerve (_emollitio_), but this erroneous opinion\r\nhad already been expressed by Galen.\r\n\r\nAs a means of cleaning teeth and keeping them free from tartar, he\r\nadvises, among other things, the use of pumice-stone powder. He\r\ndisapproves, however, of the use of oil of vitriol—unless in very\r\nminute quantities of, at the very most, one or two drops.[317]\r\n\r\nURBAIN HÉMARD, a surgeon to the Cardinal d’Armagnac, published in 1582,\r\nat Lyons, a booklet entitled: _Recherche de la vraye anathomie des\r\ndents, nature et proprietez d’icelles, où est amplement discouru de\r\nce qu’elles ont plus que les autres os; avecque les maladies qui leur\r\nadviennent, et les remedies_. This is the first dental monograph that\r\nappeared in France. The pamphlet is written with much erudition, but\r\nits contents are almost entirely taken from preceding authors. Hémard\r\nindicates by the term _deschapellement_ (decrowning) the removal of the\r\ncrown of a tooth for curative purposes. He speaks of this operation as\r\nof a method but recently introduced into therapeutics; but, and very\r\nreasonably, too, he shows himself somewhat hostile to such a method of\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nAs to what concerns the anatomy of the teeth, Hémard’s book does not\r\ncontain anything original. The following passage, transcribed by\r\nPortal,[318] shows luminously that Urbain Hémard, instead of making\r\nresearches of his own, has simply copied the Italian Eustachius,\r\ntranslating the latter almost literally. The beauty of it is that\r\nPortal had not noticed the plagiarism in the least, since he says that\r\nif Urbain Hémard had taken into account the researches of Fallopius and\r\nEustachius as well, his book would have acquired still greater value.\r\nBut, in truth, he has taken into account, and has valued the researches\r\nof Eustachius so much as to palm them off as his own! We here\r\nquote, side by side, with a paragraph taken from Hémard’s book, the\r\ncorresponding passage of Eustachius, that our readers may be convinced\r\nof the truth of what we have stated:\r\n\r\n  EUSTACHIUS.\r\n\r\n  ... aperta utraque maxilla occurrunt incisores, canini,\r\n  ac tres molares, nimirum secundus, tertius et quartus;\r\n  partim mucosi, partim ossei, non obscuræ magnitudinis,\r\n  suisque præsepiolis undique vallati:\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  incisoribus autem et caninis docta manu detractis,\r\n  tenuissimum interstitium vix osseum factum conspicitur;\r\n  quo pari diligentia amoto, obviam veniunt totidem\r\n  incisores et canini pene mucosi et longe minores, qui\r\n  post alios priores in propriis caveis latentes, singuli\r\n  singulis e regione oppositi collocati essent, nisi\r\n  utriusque maxillæ caninus magna ex parte proximo incisori\r\n  incumberet, eumque propterea fere occultaret.[319]\r\n\r\n  Primorum molarium et genuinorum qui circa septennium ac\r\n  longe etiam postea oriuntur, fateor me nullum vestigium\r\n  vidisse.\r\n\r\n  HÉMARD.\r\n\r\n  ... leur ayant ouverte l’une et l’autre mâchoire, j’y\r\n  ai trouvé seulement les dents incisoyres, les canines,\r\n  et les trois mâchelieres de chaque cousté de mâchoire;\r\n  à sçavoir la seconde, la troysième et la quatrième,\r\n  lesquelles estoit partie osseuses parti mucillagineuses,\r\n  de médiocre grandeur, garnies à l’entour de leurs petits\r\n  estuis ou alvéoles. Et depuis ayant tirees dehors\r\n  lesdictes dents incisives et canines, il se trouve un\r\n  entre-deux osseux; lequel ayant pareillement osté, il\r\n  se presente de dessoubs autant de dents incisives et\r\n  canines, toutes presque mucillagineuses, représentant la\r\n  substance d’un blanc d’œuf à demy cuite moindres pourtant\r\n  que les précédentes estant cachées dans les mesmes\r\n  estuits après les premières.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Quant est des premieres mâchelieres et des gemeles qui\r\n  à sept ans, ou longtemps après commencent à sortir,\r\n  je confesse n’en avoir trouvé jamais aucune trace n’y\r\n  commencement.\r\n\r\n  EUSTACHIUS.\r\n\r\n  Verisimile tamen est, rationique consentaneum, eos\r\n  perinde ac secundos incisores et caninos rude quoddam,\r\n  sed minus perspicuum initium ortus in utero sumere;\r\n  sensimque postea similiter formari et absolvi\r\n\r\n  HÉMARD.\r\n\r\n  Toutesfois, il est vraysemblable et raisonable aussi,\r\n  qu’elles ayent pris dans la matrice, tout ainsi que\r\n  les incisoyres et canines secondes, quelque petit\r\n  commencement de naysance et forme, moins apparante\r\n  toutefois, mais qui depuis se façonne et parfaict tout\r\n  ainsi que des autres.\r\n\r\nAt the time when Urbain Hémard was publishing his pamphlet in France,\r\nseveral other monographs were already appearing in various parts of\r\nEurope on teeth and their affections. A few years after Ryff had\r\ninitiated dental literature in Germany, other odontological writings\r\nwere published in Spain and in Italy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66\r\n\r\nTitle page of Francisco Martinez’s book (Valladolid, 1557).]\r\n\r\nFRANCISCO MARTINEZ,[320] in 1557, gave to the press in Valladolid\r\na _Coloquio breve y compendioso sobre la materia de la dentadura y\r\nmaravillosa obra de la boca, con muchos remedios y avisos necessarios,\r\ny la orden de curar y adreçar los dientes_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67\r\n\r\nFour of the instruments represented in Francisco Martinez’s book.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68\r\n\r\nA dental excavator used for ascertaining which one among several\r\ndecayed teeth was the one causing the pain (F.

In 1563 was published in Venice the excellent treatise\r\nof Eustachius on the anatomy of the teeth (_Libellus de dentibus_). At\r\nFrankfort was published, in 1576, the second dental monograph in the\r\nGerman language, _Zahnarzney_, by Adam Bodenstein von Carlstad; and\r\ntwo years later Petrus Monavius published in Basle a Latin pamphlet on\r\ndental diseases (_De dentium affectibus_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71\r\n\r\nFIG. 72\r\n\r\nDifferent kinds of forceps (F. Martinez).]\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned works, apart from the book of Eustachius, which is,\r\nof its kind, a real masterpiece, have but little importance. We have\r\ncited them here solely to show in what years and in what countries the\r\nvery first dental monographs appeared.\r\n\r\nGIROLAMO FABRIZIO, of Aquapendente (1537 to 1619), a celebrated\r\nanatomist and surgeon, wrote some very valuable works, among which a\r\ntreatise on surgery, in which the part relative to the affections of\r\nthe dental system is treated briefly but with great orderliness and\r\nclearness, thus giving a very precise idea of what dental surgery was\r\nat the end of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe principal operations which it is necessary to perform on teeth are,\r\nhe says, seven in number,[321] viz.:\r\n\r\n1. Forced opening of the dental arches in cases of prolonged\r\nconstriction of the same, so as to prevent the patient from dying of\r\nhunger.\r\n\r\n2. Cleaning of the teeth.\r\n\r\n3. Medication of carious cavities.\r\n\r\n4. Filling with gold-leaf.\r\n\r\n5. Removal or resection of teeth abnormally situated.\r\n\r\n6. Removal of any unevenness or sharpness of the teeth.\r\n\r\n7. Extraction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73\r\n\r\nInstruments for removing deposits from the teeth (F. Martinez).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74\r\n\r\nA dental scraper.\r\n\r\nA universal toothpick and a file for sharpening its points.\r\n\r\nAn instrument for removing sharp corners from the molar teeth (F.\r\nMartinez).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75\r\n\r\nA figure representing St. Apollonia, reproduced from the last page of\r\nF. Martinez’s book.]\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first operation, the author first of all examines\r\nthe various causes of the constriction of the dental arches, and\r\naccording to the various nature of this, he indicates in what cases it\r\nis fitting to have recourse to the forced opening of the jaws by means\r\nof appropriate dilators, and in what cases it is best to avoid it. In\r\nthe latter case one must seek to feed the patient in other ways—that\r\nis, either by alimentary clysters, or by a little tube passed through\r\na space already existing or purposely made by the extraction of one\r\nor two teeth; or else by letting a cannula reach down to the pharynx,\r\nthrough the nose, or, lastly, by introducing a cannula into the oral\r\ncavity through the free space existing behind the last molars. But in\r\nregard to this last method, Fabricius notes that if the constriction\r\nis of a spasmodic nature, the spasm may affect not only the elevator\r\nmuscles of the jaws, but also those that govern deglutition, including\r\nsometimes even those of the tongue itself, and in this case, as the\r\nfood introduced into the oral cavity could not be swallowed, it is\r\npreferable to convey it directly into the pharynx, by means of a\r\ncannula passed through the nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe second of the above-mentioned operations[322] is designed, says\r\nFabricius, to take away the dirtiness of the teeth and the bad odor of\r\nthe mouth (_dentium immunditiam et oris fœtorem tollit_). The dental\r\ntartar (_ostracoderma_) must be removed by slender instruments of an\r\nappropriate shape, which, for people of high position (_promagnatibus_)\r\nshall be made of silver. This advice is sufficient to make us\r\nunderstand that Fabricius, although an excellent surgeon, had no\r\npractice in dental operations; otherwise he would have known that the\r\nhardness and adhesion of tartar is generally so great that its removal\r\nabsolutely requires scrapers of tempered steel and not of a soft metal\r\nlike silver.\r\n\r\nTo arrest caries, he first drops into the carious hollow, by means\r\nof a small silver funnel, some drops of oil of vitriol, or of some\r\nother caustic liquid; and then he performs actual cauterization with\r\nappropriate instruments; after which the cavity is filled with gold\r\nleaf (auro foliato).\r\n\r\nWhen one or more teeth have appeared in an irregular position and\r\noffend the walls of the oral cavity or else the tongue, the excision\r\n(resection) of the tooth or teeth must be performed with a pair of\r\nstrong pincers, whose shape must vary according to whether the teeth\r\nare situated externally or internally with regard to the dental arches.\r\nBut as after the resection there will almost always remain some points\r\nor sharp irregularities, which by their presence would continue\r\nto irritate the soft parts, it will be necessary to remove these\r\nirritating prominences by means of the file.\r\n\r\nAs to extraction, Fabricius of Aquapendente counsels great prudence in\r\nperforming the operation, and on this point he repeats all the warnings\r\nalready given by Celsus, an author whom he greatly admires and the\r\nstudy of whose writings he warmly recommends.\r\n\r\nIt seems that in those times there was more than sufficient reason\r\nto inculcate extreme caution in regard to the extraction of teeth.\r\nThis was not then performed by true dentists, but rather by barbers\r\nand by ignorant tooth-pullers, or else, in exceptional cases, by\r\ngeneral surgeons, very skilful, perhaps, in everything else, but\r\nlittle practised in the operation we are speaking of; besides this,\r\nthe instruments left much to be desired; and lastly there was not,\r\nnor could there be, any idea of asepsis. What wonder, therefore, if\r\nthe extraction of teeth was frequently the cause of serious injuries!\r\nFabricius relates that it often happened to him to have to extract,\r\nin little fragments, half or sometimes a whole jaw, which had been\r\nattacked by putrefaction, as the result of the extraction of one single\r\ntooth. This, adds the author, may easily happen, because, when the\r\njaw is attacked by pus in one point, its very anatomical constitution\r\nfavors the rapid spreading of the putrefying process to the other\r\nparts of the bone, as this latter, apart from its external lamina, is\r\nentirely composed of a sponge-like substance.\r\n\r\nThe instruments which are used for the extraction of teeth, are,\r\nsays Fabricius, of nine kinds;[323] and the most important among\r\nthem—generically called _forceps_—are indicated by special names,\r\ntaken from their resemblance to the mouth or beak of certain animals.\r\nThus, the forceps with which it is usual to perform the extraction of\r\nmolar teeth are called “pelicans,” and of these there are two kinds,\r\naccording as they are used for the right or the left side, for the\r\nupper molars or the lower ones.\r\n\r\nA third kind of instrument goes under the name of “beak” (rostrum), and\r\nserves for the extraction of the incisors.\r\n\r\nA fourth kind is the “crow’s beak,” or “crow’s bill,” which is used for\r\nthe extraction of roots.\r\n\r\nTwo other instruments are named in Italian “cagnoli,” for they imitate\r\nthe strong bite of the dog (in Italian _cane_) and are used in cases\r\nwhere the pelican is not adapted.\r\n\r\nA seventh instrument is called by the Latin term of _terebra_ (drill\r\nor auger). It is used instead of a lever to separate the teeth from\r\none another when they are too close to each other, and so render their\r\nextraction much easier.\r\n\r\nThe eighth instrument is a “trifid lever” (_vectis trifidus_), so\r\ncalled because it is furnished with three points.\r\n\r\nThe ninth and last kind of instruments are the _dentiscalpia_, slender,\r\nsharp, and oblong tools, with which the gums are separated from the\r\nteeth before extraction.\r\n\r\nFabricius also speaks of dental prosthesis, but very briefly. He says\r\nthat artificial teeth are made of ivory or of bone (for example, from\r\nthe tibia of the ox) and are fastened by gold wire. One has recourse to\r\nthis means especially to correct the bad appearance and the defects in\r\nspeech deriving from the loss of the front teeth.\r\n\r\nThis author also makes some allusion to palatal obturators,[324] but in\r\nvery general terms, limiting himself to saying that when a perforation\r\nexists in the hard palate, it may be corrected by a piece of sponge\r\nor cotton, or with a plate of silver fixed in the palate, so as to\r\nclose up the aperture (_corrigitur spongia, vel gossypio, vel lamina\r\nargentea, quæ palato appendatur, ut foramen obstruat_).\r\n\r\nFor epulides and parulides Fabricius advises the same methods of cure\r\nthat had been recommended by Paul of Ægina.\r\n\r\nIn the case of flaccidity of the gums accompanied by looseness of\r\nthe teeth, the treatment must consist, first of all, in superficial\r\ncauterization with the red-hot iron, after which the gums must be\r\nsmeared with honey, the mouth washed with mulse, and lastly astringent\r\npowders must be used.\r\n\r\nIf the gums are much swollen, in near relation to the molar teeth, the\r\nuse of the red-hot iron, says Fabricius, becomes very difficult from\r\nthe want of space, and from the close vicinity of the healthy parts,\r\nwhich must not be injured. In such a case, it is necessary to remove,\r\nwith suitable cutting instruments, as much as is possible of the morbid\r\ntissue (_caro crassa et putrida_); then to cauterize the remaining\r\npart, making the cautery, if necessary, pass through a tube, so as not\r\nto injure the surrounding parts. When, however, the gingival swelling\r\nbleeds very easily, and its excision thus might give rise to a profuse\r\nhemorrhage, it will be best to perform the operation with cutting\r\ninstruments heated red-hot.\r\n\r\nFabricius remarks that although other authors do not make any allusion\r\nto these large gingival excrescences, he had had occasion to observe\r\nseveral cases, and had also had various instruments especially\r\nconstructed for their cure.[325]\r\n\r\nJOHANN HEURN, or in Latin Heurnius (1543 to 1601), of Utrecht, in his\r\nbook on the diseases of the eyes, ears, nose, teeth, and mouth, treats\r\nsufficiently at length of dental diseases and their cure, but without\r\nadding anything of importance to what had been written by preceding\r\nauthors. His work is a mere compilation, which would be without any\r\nimportance whatever if it did not serve to show what credit was still\r\ngiven at that period to all the errors and prejudices which are to be\r\nfound in the writings of the ancients.\r\n\r\nHeurnius, although he wrote a long time after Vesalius, still adheres,\r\nin regard to the number of teeth, to the already mentioned opinion of\r\nAristotle; he says, in fact, that women rarely have thirty-two teeth\r\nlike men.[326]\r\n\r\nHe warns those who suffer from odontalgia not to have recourse\r\nthoughtlessly to tooth-drawers, but to recur, instead, to the doctor,\r\nwho will always treat the affection according to the cause on which it\r\ndepends.\r\n\r\nAnd here the author repeats the numerous distinctions found in many\r\npreceding writers, and especially in Arculanus. The pain may be\r\nlocated in the gums, in the dental nerve, or in the very substance of\r\nthe tooth; and in each of these cases it may depend on warm or cold\r\nmatter, on dryness, humidity, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76\r\n\r\nA Dutch dentist. (From a picture of the XVI century.) By Lucas Van\r\nLeyden.]\r\n\r\nThe method of treatment must vary in all these cases; and in regard\r\nto this the author enters into minute particulars, commencing with\r\ndietetic cure—which itself must be varied according to the causes\r\nof the affection—and then treats of all the other therapeutic\r\nmeans—purgatives, bloodletting, revulsives, local narcotic or resolvent\r\nmedicaments, and so forth. The letting of blood was, it seems, a very\r\nfavorite method of cure; not only were the veins of the arm opened, but\r\nalso those of the tongue, of the gums, of the lips, and of the ears!\r\n\r\nAnother remedy which the author seems to have a predilection for is\r\noil of vitriol. When a tooth shows a carious perforation, he applies\r\ninside it, by means of a split feather, a drop of oil of vitriol,\r\nwhich, says he, causes the fall of the tooth after a few days.\r\n\r\nElsewhere he says that “sometimes worms are produced in carious teeth;\r\nto kill them a drop of oil of vitriol is an excellent remedy; and\r\nthis at the same time cures the decay of the tooth and takes away the\r\nsensibility of the nerve.”\r\n\r\nThis passage does not agree very well with the preceding one, according\r\nto which oil of vitriol would act much more radically by causing the\r\ntooth to fall out altogether. But we will not take exception to so\r\nsmall a matter; so much the more, as the author, if he were still\r\nalive, might perhaps show us by some subtle distinction that the\r\ncontradiction alluded to is only an apparent one!\r\n\r\nTo free the teeth from tartar, Heurn likewise counsels oil of vitriol,\r\ndiluted, however, with other liquids.\r\n\r\nA tooth must not be sacrificed excepting when it is loose and attacked\r\nby incipient necrosis, so as to leave no hope of arresting the\r\nputrefactive process. It is then our duty, says Heurn, to remove the\r\ntooth without causing much pain. For this purpose, after the tooth has\r\nbeen separated all around from the gums, it must be raised somewhat\r\nfrom the alveolus; then it must be sprinkled with powder of euphorbia,\r\nor a paste made with flour and the juice of the tithymalus must be\r\napplied around it, taking care, however, to cover the neighboring teeth\r\nwith wax. After two or three days the tooth will be so loose that\r\nit can be pulled out very easily with the fingers or with a pair of\r\npincers.\r\n\r\nDental surgery properly so called has been entirely neglected by Heurn.\r\nHe was perhaps so persuaded of the efficacy of the above-mentioned\r\nremedies as to believe that every other species of intervention was\r\nuseless. On the contrary, he does not abstain from speaking very\r\nseriously of the miraculous virtues of certain remedies (serpent\r\nscales, dog’s teeth, etc.); and tells us, among other things, that the\r\nbroth made from a frog, when held for a length of time in the mouth,\r\nsoothes dental pains, whatever be the causes from which they originate.\r\nOne would seem to have gone back again to the days of Pliny!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE GOLDEN TOOTH.\r\n\r\nIn 1593 a rumor spread throughout Germany of a great marvel that had\r\nappeared at Schweidnitz in Silesia: a golden tooth had erupted in the\r\nmouth of a child aged seven years, which, more precisely designated,\r\nwas the first large molar on the left of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nIn our days news of such a kind would be immediately qualified, and\r\nuniversally held to be an imposture. But three centuries ago the most\r\nmarvellous and unlikely things were easily believed in, often even by\r\nthe learned; and, therefore, the fact alluded to was taken into serious\r\nconsideration, so much so that for a long time many learned pamphlets\r\nand dissertations were written concerning it.\r\n\r\nJACOB HORST, Physician and Professor of Medicine at the Julius\r\nUniversity in Helmstadt, published, in 1595, a very singular book on\r\nthe golden tooth of the Silesian child.[327] Without raising any doubt\r\nas to the reality of the fact, he maintained that the phenomenon was\r\nproduced from the effect partly of natural and partly of supernatural\r\ncauses, in relation with the constellation under which the child was\r\nborn. On the day of its birth, that is, December 22, 1585, the sun was\r\nin conjunction with Saturn in the sign of Aries. In consequence of\r\nthis circumstance the nutritive force had developed marvellously on\r\naccount of the increase in heat, and consequently, instead of osseous\r\nsubstance, golden matter had been secreted!\r\n\r\nAfter having explained (!) in this way the origin of the phenomenon,\r\nHorst passes on to examine what events may be portended by this\r\nunheard-of marvel, he not having the least doubt that it—like\r\nearthquakes, eclipses, and comets—must be the precursory sign of\r\nimportant events. Supporting his assertions by arguments of various\r\nkinds, some of which are taken from the Bible, he concludes that the\r\ngold tooth of the Silesian child means neither more nor less than the\r\napproach of the golden age! The Roman Emperor would sweep the Turks,\r\nthe enemies of Christianity, out of Europe, and the Millenium or\r\nGolden Age would commence. As the tooth was situated on the left side\r\nof the lower jaw, it might be deduced, according to Horst, that heavy\r\ncalamities would precede the beginning of the epoch of happiness thus\r\npredicted. On the other hand, as the golden tooth was the last of the\r\ndental series of the child, this was to signify that the golden epoch\r\nthus foretold would be the last of the ages of this world before the\r\nuniversal judgment!\r\n\r\nMARTIN RULAND, in the same year, 1595, wrote about the gold tooth.[328]\r\nShortly after, he was answered by JOHANN INGOLSTETTER; and the\r\ncontroversy which arose between them in this important subject lasted\r\nfor a long time, without, however, leading to any definite conclusion.\r\n\r\nBALTHASAR CAMINDUS, a doctor of Frankfort, meanwhile had noted that for\r\nsome months the marvellous Silesian boy had not lent himself to being\r\nexamined by the learned, becoming terribly enraged whenever they wished\r\nto compel him. From this he inferred that it was a case of nothing else\r\nbut an imposture, and that the famous tooth could not have anything\r\nspecial about it, save that its crown had been very skilfully covered\r\nwith a thin plate of gold.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this the discussions on the portentous tooth continued for\r\na long time; and even one hundred years after, that is, in 1695, a new\r\ndissertation appeared on the golden tooth.\r\n\r\nThe greater number of those who wrote on this subject did not throw\r\nthe slightest doubt upon the reality of the fact, but only sought to\r\nexplain in the most varied ways the genesis of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nDUNCAN LIDDEL. Among those who had the good sense not to put faith in\r\nthe thing, and who very decidedly affirmed that this was a mere case\r\nof imposture, Duncan Liddel, a Scotchman and professor in a German\r\nUniversity, deserves to be recorded.[329]\r\n\r\nHe had heard that the famous gold tooth was larger than the others,\r\nand that the neighboring molar was wanting; from which he argued that\r\nthis was simply the case of a tooth the crown of which had been covered\r\nwith a plate of gold. Answering the arguments of Horst, he accused him\r\nof gross ignorance in the most elementary notions of astronomy, and\r\nthis for having affirmed that when the famous child was born, that is,\r\nDecember 22, the sun happened to be in conjunction with Saturn in the\r\nsign of the Ram. As the sun does not enter the sign of the Ram until\r\nMarch, if it had been there on December 22 this would have been a\r\ngreater portent than if the whole body of the child had been formed of\r\nnothing else but teeth of gold![330]\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned fact is not the only one of its kind. Serres\r\nrelates that once there was a great noise made in Poland about the\r\npretended golden teeth of another child who was carried round from city\r\nto city for the purpose of making money. A Franciscan monk had sought\r\nto explain, in one of his writings, the formation of these teeth.\r\nThe anatomist Kircher answered him in a pamphlet which had the very\r\nsuitable epigraph: _O præclare pater, nimium ne crede colori_.[331] In\r\nfact, the pretended teeth were only covered with a layer of tartar of\r\ngolden color. As the falsity of the pretended miracle might be brought\r\nto light at any moment with much scandal, a bishop thought it well\r\nto put an end in haste to the comedy, by ordering the removal of the\r\ndeceitful layer of tartar from the teeth of the child, to be performed\r\nin public, so that the imposture might be made completely clear.\r\n\r\nFrom the above story we can, at any rate, deduce an important\r\nconclusion for the history of dental art, that is to say, that even\r\nas early as 1593 there was an artificer (we do not know whether a\r\ngoldsmith or dentist) who knew how to construct a gold crown, although\r\nonly for the purposes of deception.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTHE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first signs of the separation of dental science from general\r\nmedicine were to be perceived in the sixteenth century, the period\r\nin which, as we have seen, the earliest dental monographs appeared.\r\nFrom that time this separation tended to accentuate itself ever\r\nmore strongly; dental monographs became more numerous and dentistry\r\nprogressed ever more rapidly, both in its scientific and practical\r\naspects.\r\n\r\nIn the seventeenth century, about which we are now to speak, we shall\r\nhave to call attention to many facts of the highest importance for\r\nthe development of dentistry, and with regard to literature, it is\r\nworthy of note that while the publications on dentistry that appeared\r\nin the various countries of Europe during the preceding century only\r\namounted to about twenty (taking also into account several pamphlets on\r\nthe famous golden tooth!), in the seventeenth century the number was\r\nconsiderably higher, that is, about a hundred. We shall speak of the\r\nmost important of these, as also of the works on general medicine or on\r\nsurgery of the same period, that present some interest from the point\r\nof view of dentistry.\r\n\r\nJOHANN STEPHAN STROBELBERGER, physician to the imperial baths of\r\nCarlsbad, published in the year 1630 a very curious book, the title\r\nof which, being translated, runs somewhat as follows: _Complete\r\nTreatise of Gout in the teeth, or, more properly said, of Odontagra\r\nor toothache; in which are set forth, theoretically and practically,\r\nfor the use of physicians and surgeons, the means of mitigating these\r\npains, as well as the various modes of ably extracting teeth with or\r\nwithout instruments_.”[332]\r\n\r\nThis book merely presents some interest, because it gives us a clear\r\nidea of the pitiful state in which the dental art still was in the\r\nfirst half of the seventeenth century, and shows us most clearly\r\nwhat enormous progress our specialty has made in little less than\r\ntwo centuries. Apart from this, Strobelberger’s monograph is of no\r\nimportance, it being nothing more than a most accurate compilation of\r\nall that is to be found on the subject of dental affections in earlier\r\nworks, especially from the medical point of view; the surgical part\r\nof dental therapeutics is treated in a much less complete manner, and\r\nprosthesis is entirely excluded from the plan of the work, which,\r\nhowever, is fully in accordance with the title of the book.\r\n\r\nUnder the generic name of gout,[333] or podagra, are meant, says\r\nthe author (Chapter I), all the affections produced by diseased\r\nhumors, falling “by drops” into the articular cavities and the parts\r\nsurrounding them. Strictly speaking, however, only gout in the feet is\r\nnamed _podagra_, whilst when the disease is seated in other parts of\r\nthe body it is indicated by other names, gout in the hands being called\r\n_chiragra_; in the fingers _dactilagra_; in the knee, _gonagra_; in the\r\nelbow, _pechiagra_; in the shoulder, _omagra_; in the spinal column,\r\n_rachisagra_, and so on. When the seat of the evil is in the teeth or\r\nin their articulations, by analogy it is denominated odontagra, or\r\nodontalgia, an affection which Paul of Ægina was the first to consider\r\nas being of a gouty nature (Chapter II).\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of the sensibility of the teeth (Chapter III),\r\nof the various kinds of dental pains (Chapter IV), of the different\r\ncauses, external and internal, which produce them (Chapters V to\r\nVII), of the signs which make known their special nature in each case\r\n(Chapters VIII to X), and of the prognosis (Chapter XI), the author\r\noccupies himself very minutely, throughout the rest of the book, with\r\nall that concerns means of cure, dedicating to this subject sixty-seven\r\nchapters and a long appendix.\r\n\r\nIf, after the publication of Strobelberger’s book, all previous works\r\ntreating of dental affections had been entirely lost, it would be of\r\ninestimable value for the history of dentistry, the author having\r\ngathered together in an almost complete manner—citing faithfully the\r\nrespective authors—all that had been written about dental diseases\r\nbefore him. On the other hand, the book contains almost nothing\r\noriginal; therefore, rather than analyze minutely its contents—which\r\nwould involve a long repetition of things already noted—we limit\r\nourselves merely to a few observations.\r\n\r\nStrobelberger, like Heurnius, is of opinion that for the cure of\r\ndental pains it is necessary to have recourse to doctors rather than\r\nto _dentispices_, or tooth drawers (Chapter XII); however, he does\r\nnot consider the calling of the latter absolutely useless; indeed, he\r\nexpressly advises (page 174) that they should be applied to for the\r\ninstrumental extraction of the teeth, it not being possible for such\r\noperations to be carried out well and without danger except by those\r\nwho, through great practice, have acquired the necessary skill in the\r\nuse of the relative instruments. He refers to the words of Hollerius,\r\nalready quoted, as to the falseness of the opinion that fumigations\r\nmade with the seeds of hyoscyamus cause the worms to fall out of the\r\nteeth. Notwithstanding, he does not in the least doubt the existence of\r\nthe worms themselves; and he, like Heurnius, recommends killing them\r\nwith oil of vitriol or with a decoction made from a frog cooked in\r\nwater and vinegar (Chapter XXXIII). From this, one clearly perceives\r\nthat the doubts expressed by Hollerius about the existence of dental\r\nworms had not in the least shaken the popular belief in them. Nor,\r\nindeed, could it be otherwise when one considers that Hollerius, as\r\nwe duly noted in another place, had not the courage either decidedly\r\nto deny the existence of dental worms, or to formulate in a clear\r\nand explicit manner the doubts which had arisen in his mind on this\r\nsubject. We are, therefore, unable to recognize the merit which\r\nLinderer[334] and Geist-Jacobi[335] have attributed to this author,\r\nviz., that of having effectually affirmed the non-existence of dental\r\nworms.\r\n\r\nAmong innumerable vegetable remedies recommended by Strobelberger\r\nagainst odontalgia, we will only cite two American plants, the guaiacum\r\nand the tobacco-plant (Nicotiana tabacum). Of the decoction of guaiacum\r\n(Chapter XXXVI) the author says that, used as a mouth wash, it has the\r\ntriple virtue of strengthening the gums, of preventing putrefactive\r\nprocesses, and of calming toothache.\r\n\r\nThe anti-odontalgic virtue of tobacco is mentioned (Chapter XXXVIII)\r\nfor the first time in this work, but, as we learn from Strobelberger\r\nhimself, Heurnius has already obtained, experimenting in his own\r\ncase, the cessation of an attack of toothache by holding in his mouth\r\nspoonfuls of tepid decoction of nicotiana for the space of two hours.\r\n\r\nThe same soothing effects may be obtained, says the author, from the\r\nsmoke of tobacco; but he attributes this not to the narcotic action of\r\nthe remedy, but to the fact that it causes the flow of much saliva from\r\nthe mouth and mucus from the nostrils, through which the morbid humors\r\nwhich provoke the pain are eliminated.\r\n\r\nTo those suffering from odontalgia, says Strobelberger (Chapter XL),\r\nthe internal use of certain mineral waters is also of value, and\r\nespecially that of the waters of Carlsbad (Thermæ Carolinæ). Like\r\nmany other remedies, they are useful in rendering the secretions more\r\nactive, favoring thus the elimination of morbid substances from the\r\nblood. For the same object of purifying the organism and dispersing\r\nthe accumulated humors causing the pain, many other means of cure\r\nwere in usage, such as aperients (Chapter XXV), phlebotomy, and\r\narteriotomy (Chapter XXVIII), leeching (Chapter XXIX), scarification\r\nand cupping (Chapter XXX), blistering and cauterizing (Chapter XXXI),\r\nmasticatories, viz., substances intended to be chewed for the purpose\r\nof exciting salivary secretion (Chapter XXVI), sternutatories, viz.,\r\nsubstances which provoke sneezing (Chapter XXVII), and so forth.\r\n\r\nLike Arculanus, Strobelberger makes a distinction between the _real_\r\nand the _false_ cure of odontalgia (_cura vera et cura mendosa_). This\r\nlatter he also subdivides in _palliative_ cure and _vain_ cure (Chapter\r\nLV). The palliative cure is constituted by the use of narcotics and\r\nstupefying remedies (Chapter LVI), whilst the vain cure is represented\r\nby certain remedies which he calls “fanatical” or rather “fantastical.”\r\nThe _vain_ cure, in its turn, undergoes a new distinction, since it\r\ncomprises three species of remedies, that is, the wearing of amulets,\r\nthe superstitious remedies, and the ridiculous remedies. Indeed, this\r\nlast apellation might also fittingly be applied to the preceding ones!\r\n\r\nOne would be inclined to believe that the author who qualifies these\r\nremedies as vain, fantastic, superstitious, and ridiculous was a\r\nthoroughly unprejudiced man; however, this is not so. Strobelberger,\r\ntoo, had to pay his tribute to the dominating prejudices of his\r\ncentury; this manifestly appears from various passages in his book,\r\nand especially from the Chapters XVI and XLIV. The first of these\r\nbears the following title: “How to procure immunity from toothache,”\r\nand Strobelberger therein asserts in all seriousness, basing his\r\nassertion on the authority of Rhazes, that “if the canine tooth of a\r\nlion be suspended to a child’s neck before the milk teeth fall out\r\nand during the eruption of the second teeth, it will secure the child\r\nimmunity from dental pains.” In Chapter XLIV the author speaks of those\r\nanimals whose teeth are useful to man as remedies against toothache,\r\nand reiterates—lending, as it seems, perfect faith thereto—various\r\nprejudices that are found in Pliny and other writers of antiquity.\r\n\r\nAs to the remedies which Strobelberger recognizes as _vain_—that is, as\r\ndevoid of real curative virtue—he remarks that they may nevertheless be\r\nuseful by acting powerfully on the imagination of the sufferer, thus\r\ncausing, in fact, the cessation of pain (Chapter LVII). This clear and\r\nexplicit affirmation of the efficacy of suggestion in a book published\r\n270 years ago is certainly not without interest.\r\n\r\nIf, says Strobelberger, a place is to be accorded, in dental\r\ntherapeutics, to the _vain_ remedies, among these, amulets deserve the\r\npreference; and the best accredited amulet is the root of the lepidium,\r\nalready recommended by Dioscorides, who affirms that if it be hung\r\naround the neck of the sufferer it will cause the pain to cease.\r\n\r\nOne of the _superstitious_ remedies to be used against this affection\r\n(Chapter LVIII), consists in touching the aching tooth with the tooth\r\nof a dead person, and afterward greasing it with horse’s marrow.\r\n\r\nAmong the _ridiculous_ remedies (Chapter LIX), the author describes one\r\nthat was especially in use among soldiers. With a piece of chalk or of\r\nrubble one writes on a table:\r\n\r\n   Chiacia        Chiacia        Chiacia\r\n  X   O   X      X   O   X      X   O   X\r\n\r\nOne then pricks the tooth with a knife or an iron toothpick until it\r\nbleeds slightly; then thrusting the point of the instrument, to which\r\nthe blood adheres, into the first cross, then into the second, then\r\ninto the third, and so on, one asks the patient each time if the tooth\r\nstill pains him. Before one gets to the last cross the pain ceases!\r\nThis stolid cure, says the author, has no other value than that of the\r\nscarification of the part affected.\r\n\r\nStrobelberger held, as did many of the preceding authors, that the\r\nextraction of a tooth ought to be the _last_ remedy, that is, to be\r\nhad recourse to when all others, including cauterization, which he\r\nconsiders as the _last but one_, have proved ineffectual. There are\r\ncases, however, in which the extraction of a tooth is absolutely\r\nindicated, and here, by the way, the author acquaints us with the\r\nfollowing poetic aphorism, which expressed the unanimous opinion of\r\ndoctors:\r\n\r\n  Si dens pertusus, vel putridus esse notatur,\r\n  Corrumpens alios, tunc protinus ejiciatur.\r\n\r\nThat is, if one finds that a tooth is hollow or decayed, and corrupts\r\nthe others, it must at once be extracted.\r\n\r\nStrobelberger, like the greater number of his predecessors, is fully\r\npersuaded that diseased teeth may be made to fall out by the use of\r\nspecial remedies; indeed, this clearly appears from the title of the\r\nwork itself, as, without doubt, the reader will already have observed.\r\nSuch remedies are called by him “odontagoga,” and he describes them\r\nat great length in five different chapters (X to XIV) of the second\r\nsection of his book, dedicated to the surgical care of the teeth.\r\n\r\nIn regard to _violent extraction_ of teeth, Strobelberger shows still\r\ngreater cautiousness and timidity than Celsus or Abulcasis. He requires\r\nthat, after the gum has been detached, one should endeavor to extract\r\nthe tooth with the fingers or by means of a thread; if, however, this\r\ndoes not succeed, one may have recourse to the trifid lever; only at\r\nlast, that is, when even the lever has failed, does he allow the use of\r\nan appropriate dental forceps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wilhelm Fabry.]\r\n\r\nARNAULD GILLES, a Frenchman, in the year 1622, published in Paris a\r\nwork whose curious title we will here note: _The flower of the remedies\r\nagainst toothache_.[336] We know nothing else about this publication,\r\nwhich, however, to judge from its title, cannot be other than a mere\r\ncompilation.\r\n\r\nDUPONT, another Frenchman, in 1633, published an important pamphlet,\r\nwhich I have, unfortunately, not been able to see. I can, therefore,\r\nonly quote what Sprengel says of it.[337] Dupont recommends, in cases\r\nof obstinate toothache, the extraction and immediate replantation of\r\nthe tooth; which, he says, becomes quite firm again, but will no more\r\ncause any pain. In confirmation of this, Denis Pomaret related, a\r\nlittle later, a case in which a healthy tooth having been pulled out\r\nby mistake, and immediately put back into the socket and treated with\r\nastringent remedies, became perfectly firm again.[338]\r\n\r\nAlthough Abulcasis and Ambroise Paré had already recommended the\r\nreplantation of teeth, the loss of which had been caused by trauma,\r\nand although Peter Foreest had already made known as a result of his\r\nown personal experience that the luxation (not, however, complete\r\nextraction) of a tooth and its successive replantation is capable of\r\ncausing toothache to cease, nevertheless, we must recognize that the\r\nmerit of having elevated replantation in non-traumatic cases to a\r\nspecial method of cure must be attributed to Dupont.\r\n\r\nWILHELM FABRY (1560 to 1634), a German, and native of the small town\r\nof Hilden near Cologne, better known by his Latin name of Fabricius\r\nHildanus, was chief doctor to the city of Berne, and acquired great\r\nfame as well by his extraordinary professional ability as by his works,\r\nconsisting principally in reports of many hundreds of important and\r\ninstructive clinical cases. He is rightly considered one of the most\r\nillustrious German surgeons. His writings have largely contributed not\r\nonly to the progress of surgery in general, but also to that of dental\r\nsurgery in particular.\r\n\r\nOne of his observations clearly shows the etiological relation\r\nfrequently existing between a prosopalgia or a supposed hemicrania and\r\na dental affection. The case referred to is that of a lady who had been\r\nsubject for six months to violent pain in the upper teeth of one side\r\nof the jaw. The toothache little by little disappeared, giving place to\r\nan obstinate cephalalgia in the same side of the head, which gradually\r\nbecame so intense as to be perfectly insupportable, the patient being\r\nparticularly subject to it when the weather was cold and damp. After\r\nfour years of atrocious suffering, and after innumerable remedies had\r\nbeen tried without avail, Fabricius Hildamus—having had the luminous\r\nidea of seeking the cause of the evil in the teeth—obtained a complete\r\ncure, without further trouble, by extracting four of the patient’s\r\nteeth, which were decayed.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is an all-important canon of medical practice, that\r\nin every case of neuralgia occurring within the region influenced\r\nby the trifacial nerve one should give particular attention to the\r\nstate of the teeth and carefully treat every affection of the same.\r\nNotwithstanding—we say it with regret—there are still medical men who\r\nignore or neglect this precept, and prescribe internal remedies or\r\nhave recourse to injections of morphine when they ought, in the first\r\nplace, to call in the aid of a dentist. How many patients would have\r\nbeen delivered from slow martyrdom if the example of the clear-seeing\r\nphysician of Berne had been followed from his days up to the present\r\ntime!\r\n\r\nFabricius Hildanus relates, besides, many cases of dental fistula,\r\ncured by him through the extraction of roots or of decayed teeth. In\r\none such case the fistula dated from fourteen years back. Fabricius\r\nHildanus, contrary to the opinion of many other doctors, extracted a\r\ndecayed tooth, and by this operation obtained, in a brief period of\r\ntime, the complete recovery of the patient.\r\n\r\nAmong the many very important clinical cases cited by Fabricius\r\nHildanus, the following deserves to be recorded: In the year 1590 a\r\nwoman presented herself to him who had a hard tumor in the space behind\r\nthe last molar on the right side. The author, after having prepared\r\nthe patient for the operation by the methods then in use (that is, by\r\naperient medicine, by bleeding, and appropriate diet), destroyed the\r\ntumor by the application of escharotic substances. The remaining wound,\r\nhowever, defying all the cicatrizing remedies which the author had\r\nrecourse to, one after the other, by reason of its being continually\r\ndisturbed by the movements of the jaws, he then thought of maintaining\r\nthe dental arches in a determined position, and this he obtained by\r\nmeans of two pieces of wood somewhat hollowed out above and below,\r\nwhich he placed on the right and on the left between the upper and the\r\nlower teeth, fixing them to the teeth themselves by brass wires passing\r\nthrough two openings made expressly in each of the two pieces of wood.\r\nIn this way he succeeded in obtaining the absolute immobility of the\r\njaws and the complete cure of the wound in a few days, during which\r\ntime the patient was nourished with liquid food.[339]\r\n\r\nA very interesting case, inasmuch as it demonstrated the damage and\r\nperil which may result from certain absurd means of cure, was reported\r\nto this author by Claudio Deodato, physician to the Prince-Bishop of\r\nBasle. The case was that of a patient who, after having tried in vain a\r\ngreat number of remedies for a stubborn toothache, finally had recourse\r\nto the use of aqua fortis; but this substance, which in those days was\r\nin frequent use for dental caries and for toothache, produced most\r\ndeleterious effects in the patient, that is to say, the loss of almost\r\nall his teeth, necrosis of the inferior jaw, with fistulous sinuses and\r\nulceration of the neck, abundant sanious discharge, fever, a cachectic\r\ncondition, incipient necrosis of the upper jaw, etc.[340] Fabricius\r\nHildanus, consulted by Claudio Deodato about this most serious case,\r\nproposed both a local and a general treatment, the result of which is,\r\nhowever, not mentioned in his book.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth “_centuria_ of medical and surgical observations and\r\ncures”[341] we find a case of oral surgery, to which it is worth while\r\nbriefly to refer here. It relates to an epulis situated next to the\r\nupper canine of the left side. The tumor, already of ancient date,\r\nhad at this time reached the size of a walnut, was very hard, livid\r\nin color, irregular in form, and adhered somewhat to the upper lip;\r\naccording to the author, it was of a cancerous nature. After the usual\r\npreparative measures, Fabricius Hildanus proceeded to the ablation of\r\nthe tumor, and to this end he first pierced it with a curved needle and\r\nstrong thread, in order to get a good hold on it, and he then removed\r\nit entirely down to the bone, by means of a curved bistoury.[342]\r\n\r\nFabricius Hildanus, having dissected several abortive fetuses of under\r\nfour months, was able to verify the exactitude of the assertion made\r\nby Hippocrates, afterward luminously confirmed by different Italian\r\nanatomists, that the teeth begin to be formed during intra-uterine\r\nlife. And with reference to this he also relates the following fact:\r\n\r\nThe wife of a Protestant minister gave birth to a female child which\r\nalready had a fully developed tooth, a lower middle incisor, equal in\r\nsize to that of a child of two years old, and which interfered with the\r\nsucking by injuring the nipple of the mother’s breast and the tongue of\r\nthe child itself. So it was necessary that it should be removed. But it\r\nwas found to be so firm that the surgeon sought in vain to extract it\r\nwith a thread, and was obliged to have recourse to the forceps.[343]\r\n\r\nObservation XXXI of the third _centuria_ relates a case of rhinoplasty.\r\nIn the year 1590, when the Duke of Savoy made war on the inhabitants of\r\nGeneva, a girl named Susanna N. fell into the hands of the soldiers,\r\nwho tried to deflower her; enraged at not succeeding in their intent,\r\nthey cut off her nose. Two years later the girl went to Lausanne,\r\nthe residence of J. Griffon, an eminent surgeon of that time, who\r\nperformed the rhinoplastic operation on her in so splendid a manner\r\nthat one would have taken the new nose for a natural one, not only\r\nfrom its normal appearance, but also because the scar was hardly\r\nvisible. Fabricius Hildanus, having had occasion to see and examine\r\nthe patient several times, even up to twenty-one years after the\r\noperation, was able to testify to the perfect condition of the nose;\r\nin the extreme cold of the winter, however, it was apt to become livid\r\nat the point. He does not describe the operative process followed by\r\nGriffon, but merely says that the first inventor of this operation was\r\nGaspare Tagliacozzi, of the University of Bologna, and that Griffon had\r\nundertaken the reproduction of the same from his own conception of it,\r\nbased on the information imparted to him in conversation, by an Italian\r\nwho had been operated upon by Tagliacozzi.\r\n\r\nJOHANN SCHULTES (1595 to 1645), a physician in Ulm, was the author of a\r\nvery important work entitled _Armamentarium chirurgicum_, in which are\r\ngiven plates and descriptions of almost all the surgical instruments\r\nthat had been in use up to that date. As to the part relating to dental\r\nand oral surgery, we find the following instruments named in this work:\r\n\r\n1. Several kinds of pelicans; an instrument which was so called from\r\nits resemblance to the beak of the bird of the same name, and used for\r\nextracting the molar teeth.\r\n\r\n2. The common dental forceps, then named _cagnolo_ by the Italians,\r\nbecause of the supposed likeness to a dog’s muzzle.\r\n\r\n3. The crow’s beak forceps (_rostrum corvinum_), designed for the\r\nextraction of dental roots, and, therefore, corresponding to the\r\nrhizagra of Celsus.\r\n\r\n4. Two special dental forceps, or _dentiduces_, for the removal of\r\nteeth which could not be extracted either with the pelican or with the\r\ncommon dental forceps.\r\n\r\n5. Bifid and trifid elevators (_vectes bifidi et trifidi_), to be used\r\nfor the extracting of incisors and canine teeth, as well as roots.\r\n\r\n6. _Dentiscalpia_ for detaching the gum from the tooth before\r\nproceeding to extract it, in order that this may be the more easily\r\naccomplished and with less danger.\r\n\r\n7. A silver funnel or cannula (_infundibulum seu fistula argentea_),\r\nfor nourishing patients affected with trismus, by conveying liquid food\r\ninto the fauces, through the free space behind the last molars.\r\n\r\n8. Forceps more or less like in form to the beak of the parrot or the\r\nvulture (_rostrum psittacinum et vulturinum_), for the removal or\r\nresection of teeth that have grown in abnormal positions.\r\n\r\n9. A screw dilator (_dilatatorium cum cochlea_), for gradually opening\r\nthe dental arches in cases of spasmodic constriction of the jaws.[344]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A plate of Schulte’s “Armamentarium Chirurgicum,”\r\nshowing some dental and other operations._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77\r\n\r\nA plate from Schultes’ “Armamentarium chirurgicum,” showing several\r\ndental instruments.]\r\n\r\nMARCO AURELIO SEVERINO (1580 to 1656), of Tarsia, a celebrated\r\nprofessor of surgery in the Neapolitan University, had a great\r\npredilection for the use of the cauterizing iron, which he also used\r\nvery frequently in curing caries and other dental diseases. At times,\r\nto effect a cessation of violent toothache, he would have recourse to\r\nthe cauterization of the antihelix! Against flaccidity of the gums and\r\nloosening of the teeth he also used cauterization, disapproving the use\r\nof astringent substances, as these cannot get so far as the roots of\r\nthe affected teeth. Severino boasts of having cured by cauterization at\r\nleast two hundred cases of dental diseases.\r\n\r\nLAZARE RIVIÈRE (1589 to 1655), a professor at the University of\r\nMontpelier, also known by his latinized name of Lazarus Riverius,\r\ntreats of dental affections and their cure, in various parts of his\r\nworks, considering them, however, almost exclusively from a medical\r\npoint of view.\r\n\r\nHe speaks first of all of the different causes of odontalgia, and,\r\namong these, does not omit to mention worms. These, he says, may\r\nbe generated in the carious cavities, owing to the putrefaction of\r\nsubstances retained in their interior. Whenever odontalgia is caused\r\nby worms, the pain, says Rivière, is not continuous, but ceases and\r\nreturns at brief intervals; besides, the sufferer perceives at times\r\nthe movement of the worm inside the tooth!\r\n\r\nWhat one reads in the works of this author as to remedies to be used\r\nfor odontalgia clearly demonstrates how irrationally dental diseases\r\nwere treated in the seventeenth century and what tortures were\r\ninflicted on the patients. In many cases, and especially when the pain\r\nwas held to be occasioned by “hot humors,” the treatment was begun by\r\nbleeding in the arm. The following day an aperient was administered.\r\nAfterward, if the pain still persisted, the sufferer was cupped in\r\nthe region of the scapulæ or of the spine, blisters were applied to\r\nthe nape of the neck or behind the ears, resinous plasters to the\r\ntemples; all this without taking into account the remedies which were\r\nintroduced into the ears, or the various medications or operations\r\nperformed on the aching part itself, and many other things besides.\r\nIn fact, in order to cure a toothache, the whole body of the sufferer\r\nwas seized upon and put to torture, and in the majority of cases they\r\nassuredly finished by extracting the diseased tooth! When we reflect\r\non the extraordinary frequency of dental disorders we cannot do less\r\nthan recognize that the dentists, by the radical change effected in the\r\nmethods of treatment, have diminished in no small degree the sufferings\r\nof humanity!\r\n\r\nAccording to Rivière, the small veins (sic) that nourish the teeth pass\r\nthrough the ear (!); and this would explain how the cessation of a\r\ntoothache may be obtained by the introduction of certain remedies into\r\nthe meatus auditorius externus. Relief may be obtained, for instance,\r\nby dropping oil of bitter almonds into the ear on the side affected by\r\nthe pain, or by allowing the vapor of hot vinegar, in which pennyroyal\r\nor origanum has been boiled, to penetrate into it. Others, adds the\r\nauthor, pour a little pure vinegar into the ear, which is especially\r\nefficacious against “hot fluxions.” When, however, the toothache\r\ndepends on a “cold fluxion,” it calms the pain wonderfully to drop\r\ninto the ear a tepid mixture of garlic juice and theriac. The same\r\nadvantage, says the author, may be obtained by introducing a piece of\r\ngarlic, peeled and cut into the form of a suppository, into the ear.\r\n\r\nThe author also makes a lengthy enumeration of anodyne and narcotic\r\nremedies (among which opium), observing, however, that those remedies,\r\nunless the vehemence of the pain obliges the use of them, ought not\r\nto have the preference, it being much more rational and much more\r\nadvantageous to institute a cure which aims directly at the cause\r\nitself of the pain (fluxions, worms, etc.).\r\n\r\nHe informs us that Amatus Lusitanus, a celebrated physician of the\r\nsixteenth century, extolled, as a remedy for toothache, a decoction of\r\ngum sandarach in wine and vinegar; the said decoction was to be made\r\nwith an ounce of sandarach in six ounces of wine and the same quantity\r\nof vinegar, and ought to be kept in the mouth some length of time,\r\nwhilst hot.\r\n\r\nRivière further speaks of various masticatories, which were composed of\r\nmastich, staphisagria, pyrethrum, henbane, etc.\r\n\r\nHe also mentions oil of cloves, which even then was used against\r\ntoothache, by introducing into carious cavities a small piece of\r\ncotton-wool soaked in it. Oil of camphor was used in the same manner,\r\nbut the most efficacious of all, according to the author, was oil of\r\nboxwood.\r\n\r\nAs to worms in the teeth, they may be destroyed by the use of bitter\r\nsubstances!\r\n\r\nIn the case of a caries penetrating into the inner cavity of the tooth,\r\nto effect the cessation of pain, it is necessary to burn the nerve with\r\nthe actual cautery, or with aqua fortis, or with oil of vitriol. If\r\nthis be repeated several times, the tooth gradually falls to pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter having enumerated all these remedies, the author speaks of the\r\nextraction of the teeth, and of all the precautions with which this\r\nmust be carried out in order to avoid the various accidents which may\r\nresult from the operations and may even, sometimes, become a cause of\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nWhen abundant hemorrhage follows the extraction of a tooth, this may\r\noften be made to cease by applying a small, very compact ball of linen\r\ninto the alveolus and maintaining it there by pressure during one or\r\ntwo hours. Should this not suffice, one can combine with compression\r\nthe use of astringent substances. Finally, as a last remedy, use may be\r\nmade of the red-hot iron.\r\n\r\nIn the case of timid patients, who shrink from an instrumental\r\noperation, recourse may be had to eradicating remedies, the\r\nauthor being fully convinced of their efficacy. Indeed, one of\r\nthese—helleboraster—is said to be so powerful that, when rubbed on\r\nthe teeth, these fall out within the space of a few hours; for which\r\nreason it is absolutely necessary, in making use of it, to cover over\r\nthe neighboring teeth with wax, so that the healthy ones may not also\r\nfall out, as happened, says the author, in the case of a poor peasant.\r\n\r\nThe internal use of mercury, and even the use of certain mercurial\r\npreparations used by women as cosmetics, is of damage to the teeth and\r\nimparts to them a blackish or dirty looking color.\r\n\r\nNumerous remedies exist for cleaning the teeth, but according to\r\nRivière the best way of cleaning them consists in rubbing them with\r\na small stick immersed in sulphuric acid (_spiritus sulphuris aut\r\nvitrioli_) and afterward drying them with a piece of linen. This remedy\r\nnot only cleans and renders the teeth white, but it preserves them also\r\nfrom caries! If the teeth are very dirty, the spirit of vitriol may be\r\nused pure; otherwise one mixes it with _mel rosatum_ or with water.\r\n\r\nThe great enthusiasm shown by Rivière for the above-mentioned remedy\r\ndoes not, however, derive from a long experience, made by himself or by\r\nothers, of its advantages, but is based principally on a fact referred\r\nto by Montanus, and which,[345] we will here recount, because, from it,\r\none clearly perceives how credulously our forebears accepted general\r\naffirmations and formulated therapeutic precepts.\r\n\r\nMontanus recounts in one of his writings, how, being in Rome in his\r\nearly youth, he became acquainted with a woman of about twenty years\r\nof age, known by the name of Maria Greca (by the way the author speaks\r\nof her, one is led to suspect she was a courtesan); and how, having\r\nseen her again, thirty years later, and found her in pretty much\r\nthe same conditions as formerly, he expressed his surprise at this;\r\nwhereupon Maria Greca told him that she herself believed that she owed\r\nthe conservation of her beauty to the habit, already of many years’\r\nstanding, of using one or two drops of oil of vitriol every morning, as\r\na friction for the teeth and gums. In her youth she had had very bad\r\nteeth, but by reason of this cure they had become, and were at the time\r\nbeing, beautiful and perfectly firm; the gums also were in excellent\r\ncondition; it seemed, therefore, to her that this conservation of\r\nhealth and freshness, in spite of her fifty years, depended precisely\r\non the daily use, in the manner described, of oil of vitriol![346]\r\n\r\nRivière, besides, recommends tobacco ashes for cleaning the teeth, a\r\ncounsel not yet given by any previous author. He also gives the formulæ\r\nfor two dentifrice powders, the basis of which is alum; he calls\r\nattention to the great importance of taking assiduous care to keep\r\nthe teeth clean, and advises that after each meal the residues of food\r\nbe removed from the interstices of the teeth and the mouth well rinsed\r\nwith wine.[347]\r\n\r\nNICOLAUS TULP, in Latin, Tulpius (1593 to 1674), a distinguished\r\nphysician and anatomist of Amsterdam, contradicts the then prevailing\r\nopinion among doctors, that is, that the cure of dental affections\r\nand the operations relating thereto were matters to be held in little\r\naccount. He observes that diseases of the teeth may give rise to the\r\nmost serious consequences, which can even be the cause of death,\r\nand are, therefore, worthy of being taken into equally serious\r\nconsideration as all the other diseases of the several parts of the\r\nhuman body.\r\n\r\nThis author relates a clinical case tending to demonstrate how\r\nincisions made in the gums, advised in the first place by Vesalius,\r\nin order to facilitate the erupting of the last molar, are not always\r\nexempt from danger. A young doctor of Amsterdam, by name Goswin Hall,\r\nbeing tormented by insupportable pain caused by the difficult eruption\r\nof a wisdom tooth, had the gum lanced above it. But the pain, instead\r\nof diminishing, became worse; fever and delirium supervened, followed\r\nby death! (Here, however, we must be allowed to observe that nothing\r\ndemonstrates that the real cause of death was the lancing of the gum,\r\nor that without this the case would have had a different termination.\r\nAn event can occur after another and yet be quite independent of the\r\nformer and result from quite different causes.)\r\n\r\nAmong the cases cited by Tulp, the following is also worthy of\r\nmention. He relates having arrested a violent and persistent attack of\r\nhemorrhage, which came on after the extraction of a tooth, by applying\r\nand compressing a piece of sponge inside the alveolus.[348]\r\n\r\nThe belief that dental caries and toothache could be caused by worms\r\nwas, at that time, still in full vigor, and it gained still greater\r\nforce by reason of observations recorded by different scientists, whose\r\naffirmations could with difficulty be doubted, for at that period the\r\ngreater number still swore blindly _in verba magistri_.\r\n\r\nOLIGERUS JACOBAENS (1650 to 1701), a Danish physician and anatomist,\r\nwho taught in the University of Copenhagen, declared that in scraping\r\nthe decayed cavity of a tooth that was the cause of violent pain, he\r\nhad seen a worm come forth, which, having been put into water, moved\r\nabout in it for a long time.\r\n\r\nMARTIN SIX, having split some decayed teeth a short time after they had\r\nbeen extracted, asserts that he determined the existence of worms in\r\nthem. (It is probable that this observer, as well as others, mistook\r\nthe dental pulp for a worm, an unpardonable error, in truth, at a time\r\nwhen the anatomical constitution of the teeth had already been very\r\nwell studied by several scientists, and especially by the celebrated\r\nBartolomeo Eustachius.)\r\n\r\nGABRIEL CLAUDER (1633 to 1691) not only believed in dental worms, but\r\nmaintained besides that these were the most frequent among all the\r\ncauses of toothache. In a certain way, to sustain this opinion of his,\r\nhe relates a case in which a tooth of healthy appearance being the seat\r\nof great pain, a tooth-drawer had asserted that there must be a worm in\r\nits interior; and, in fact, on the tooth being extracted and afterward\r\nsplit, the little animal whose existence the tooth-drawer had divined,\r\nwas found to be existing inside of it!\r\n\r\nPHILIP SALMUTH asserts that by using rancid oil he got a worm out of\r\nthe decayed tooth of a person suffering from violent toothache, thus\r\ncausing the cessation of the pain. The worm, he says, was an inch and a\r\nhalf in length (!) and similar in form to a cheese maggot.\r\n\r\nNICOLAUS PECHLIN (1646 to 1706), professor of medicine at Kiel,\r\ntestifies to having seen five such dental worms, like maggots, come out\r\nby the use of honey, though he does not say whether they issued from\r\nseveral cavities or from one only!\r\n\r\nGOTTFRIED SCHULZ. But all this is nothing compared to what Gottfried\r\nSchulz has dared to assert, viz., that by using the gastric juice of\r\nthe pig, worms of great size can be enticed out of decayed teeth; some\r\nof these even reaching the dimension of an earth-worm!\r\n\r\nIt is not much to be wondered at that these things should have been\r\nblindly believed in, if we reflect that only a short time previous\r\nto this the story of the golden tooth had been taken seriously by\r\nmen of great erudition, and that in the very epoch of which we are\r\nspeaking the illustrious anatomist THOMAS BARTHOLIN (1616 to 1680), of\r\nCopenhagen, relates having seen a man, at Padua, who had an iron tooth!\r\nBesides, the possibility of such a phenomenon was explained in a most\r\ncurious manner by THOMAS MINADOUS, who explained that in the same way\r\nas iron is generated in the macrocosm, that is, in the world, so it is\r\nequally admissible that it may be generated in the microcosm, that is,\r\nin man![349]\r\n\r\nNATHANIEL HIGHMORE. In the year 1651 the English physician and\r\nanatomist Nathaniel Highmore (1613 to 1684), of Hampton, published a\r\ntreatise on anatomy (_Corporis humani disquisitio anatomica_, etc.), by\r\nwhich he acquired a celebrity superior, perhaps, to his merits. This\r\nwork, however, served without doubt to diffuse the knowledge of an\r\nanatomical fact of the highest importance, especially from the point of\r\nview of dentistry and surgery.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that the existence of the maxillary sinus was already\r\nknown before Highmore, the celebrated anatomists Vesalius, Ingrassias,\r\nEustachius, and Fallopius having spoken of it very clearly; only\r\nthrough ignorance of the history of anatomy has it been affirmed by\r\nmany that this cavity was discovered by Highmore, to whom is only\r\ndue the merit of having described the maxillary sinus, by him called\r\n_antrum_, most accurately, and of having made known the possibility\r\nof a communication between it and the mouth. Highmore calls attention\r\nto the fact that the inferior wall of the antrum often presents small\r\nprojections, which correspond with the tops of the alveoli, and that\r\nthe osseous lamina which interposes between these latter and the\r\nmaxillary sinus is often extremely thin; for which reason, it may\r\neasily happen that, in extracting one of the teeth below the cavity,\r\none may bring away together with the tooth the small osseous plate that\r\nforms the bottom of the alveolus, thus leaving the maxillary sinus\r\nopen at its inferior part. With regard to this, he refers to a most\r\ninteresting case which afterward acquired a high degree of notoriety.\r\nIt relates to a lady who had suffered from toothache for some years,\r\nand who from time to time had had several decayed teeth extracted,\r\nwithout, however, finding relief. The pain only ceased after the\r\npatient had had the left upper canine removed. But after this operation\r\nan incessant flow of humors from the alveolus of the extracted tooth\r\ntook place. The patient, in great anxiety at this circumstance and\r\ndesirous of seeing clearly into the causes of it, herself explored\r\nthe affected part with a silver probe, the entire length of which\r\npenetrated into the cavity, producing in the patient the effect of its\r\nhaving reached the eye. Still more amazed, and urged on by the desire\r\nof becoming still better acquainted with the extent of the evil, she\r\nnow made use of a long feather, which she had previously stripped,\r\nand discovered to her painful surprise that this new instrument of\r\nexploration entered to so great a distance that it, according to her\r\nidea, penetrated into the skull. From this she derived argument for\r\nthe belief that the morbid phenomenon had its origin in her brain.\r\nBelieving herself affected with a serious malady, she consulted\r\nHighmore, who had the satisfaction of being able to tranquillize her\r\ncompletely by making her understand that the jaw bone is hollow in the\r\ninside, and that its cavity had remained open underneath in consequence\r\nof the extraction of the canine tooth; and also, that the feather had\r\nnot penetrated to such a distance as she supposed, but had curved\r\ninside the bone. As to the discharge which had given so much trouble\r\nand alarm, Highmore considered it quite a natural circumstance, derived\r\nsimply from the opening of the antrum, as he held that in many cases\r\nthe maxillary sinus contains mucus, and that this condition was,\r\ntherefore, altogether normal. So he did not propose any treatment, and\r\nthe lady thenceforth supported her infirmity with resignation.\r\n\r\nThis most interesting case soon became generally known, and\r\ncontributed, without doubt, not a little to attract the attention of\r\nmedical men to the anatomical peculiarities which Highmore had pointed\r\nout in the upper maxillary bone, thus causing his name to become\r\ninseparably associated with the maxillary sinus.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that Highmore never even suspected to what\r\nvery important practical applications his description would give rise.\r\nHe knew nothing about the diseases of the antrum, and believed that,\r\neven in perfectly normal conditions, this cavity is often filled with\r\nliquid; the idea, therefore, of its being advisable, in certain cases,\r\nto extract a tooth and perforate the alveolus in order to give exit to\r\nthe liquid contained in the maxillary sinus never occurred to him.\r\n\r\nAbout fifty years went by before a rational treatment for affections of\r\nthe antrum was initiated, the merit of which, as we shall see at its\r\ntime and place, was due to William Cowper. During that half century\r\nmaladies of the maxillary sinus continued to be badly diagnosticated\r\nand badly treated.\r\n\r\nBERNARDO VALENTINI. In the year 1686, that is, thirty-five years after\r\nthe publication of Highmore’s book, Bernardo Valentini, professor at\r\nthe University of Giessen, described a case of tumefaction and abscess\r\nin the cheek, treated by him with emollient remedies, and in which,\r\nalthough according to him caries of the underlying bone did not exist,\r\nthe separation of a sufficiently large osseous fragment took place.\r\nWithout doubt the affection of the cheek was derived in this case from\r\nsome disease of the antrum; however, it would appear that Valentini\r\ndid not in the least perceive any such casual relation, as he makes no\r\nallusion whatever to it.[350]\r\n\r\nANTONIO MOLINETTI, professor at the University of Padua, had,\r\nhowever, ten years previously, diagnosticated and cured an affection\r\nof the antrum by means of an operation. In his book _Dissertationes\r\nanatomico-pathologicæ_, published at Venice in 1675, Molinetti relates\r\nthat in a case of abscess of the maxillary sinus, which caused the\r\npatient great suffering, he performed the operation of trepanning the\r\nupper maxillary bone anteriorly, after incision of the soft parts\r\noverlying it. In a certain way we may, therefore, consider Molinetti as\r\na precursor of William Cowper.\r\n\r\nHaving spoken of the very important anatomical fact illustrated by\r\nHighmore, we will now also speak briefly of those authors who, in\r\nthe seventeenth century, occupied themselves with the anatomy of the\r\nteeth. Their number is sufficiently large; we will, however, only make\r\nmention of such as contributed to the development of this branch of\r\nscience, or who, at least, expressed some opinion worthy of note.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated anatomist ADRIAN SPIEGEL (1578 to 1625), better known by\r\nthe Latinized name of _Spigelius_, wrote nothing noteworthy about the\r\nteeth, but he appears to have been the first to affirm that the teeth\r\nare more firmly fixed in the alveolus, when their roots are curved\r\nafter the manner of hooks.[351]\r\n\r\nDIEMERBROEK, a Dutchman, relates several cases of dental anomalies,\r\nas for example, of teeth being cut in the palate, and which injured\r\nthe tongue. The author cites his own case, relating that having\r\nhad a canine tooth extracted when well advanced in years, it was,\r\nnevertheless, succeeded by a new one. He relates, besides, that he\r\nhad seen in Utrecht a woman, aged fifty-six years, who again cut two\r\nincisors after having lost the former ones two years previously. Apart\r\nfrom this, Diemerbroeck tells us nothing of interest or importance\r\nregarding the teeth, often repeating old ideas, the falseness of which\r\nhad already been luminously demonstrated. For instance, he says that\r\nthe permanent teeth are developed from the roots of the deciduous ones\r\nremaining in the alveoli; an unpardonable error for an anatomist of\r\nthe seventeenth century, for which he was afterward taken to task by\r\nDuverney.[352]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BARTHOLIN, whom we have already mentioned, speaks of a tooth\r\nwhich had made all the round of the alveolar border; that is to say,\r\nof a dental arch constituted by a single piece; and the Italian\r\nanatomist BERNARDO GENGA makes mention of an analogous case.[353] It is\r\nsuperfluous to add that these authors allowed themselves to be deceived\r\nby false appearances, owing especially to an abundant and uniform\r\ndeposit of tartar on the surface of the teeth and in their interstices,\r\nwhich gave to the dental arch the appearance of one continuous piece.\r\n\r\nRINALDUS FREDERICUS, in his erudite dissertation entitled _De dentium\r\nstatu naturali et præternaturali_, spoke of the dental system with\r\nsufficient thoroughness, if we consider the epoch in which he wrote. He\r\ncommences his work with a long chapter on the importance and dignity\r\nof the teeth (_dignitas dentium_). Among other things, he relates that\r\nformerly, in certain parts of India, the teeth were so highly valued as\r\nto be offered in sacrifice to the gods. He says, too, on the authority\r\nof certain authors, that the ancients were led to believe that the\r\nteeth served for the resurrection of the body, from the circumstance of\r\ntheir not showing signs of corruption when found in sarcophagi.\r\n\r\nDiscoursing of the genesis of the teeth, Fredericus says that “every\r\ntooth is at first enclosed within a follicle, that is, in a frail,\r\nskin-like membrane, in the same manner as the grain in the wheat-ear.”\r\nTaking this comparison as his point of departure,[354] he gives to\r\ndentition the name _germination_.\r\n\r\nThis author says that the teeth of the Ethiopians and of the Indians\r\nare generally whiter than those of the northern peoples, but that those\r\nof the Indians soon lose their primitive whiteness by reason of the\r\nwidely diffused habit of chewing betel-nuts.\r\n\r\nFredericus refers to an experiment which, according to him,\r\ndemonstrates the “sympathetic relations” between the teeth and the ear\r\n(whilst in reality it only proves the facility with which sounds may be\r\ntransmitted through solid bodies). “If, by night,” says he, “one holds\r\ntightly between one’s teeth the end of a stick, stuck upright in the\r\nground, one hears the footsteps of a person approaching from afar much\r\nmore easily.”\r\n\r\nThrough the researches of three great men, Marcello Malpighi, Friedrich\r\nRuysch, and Antoni van Leeuwenhoeck, an altogether new science arose\r\nin the seventeenth century, viz., histology, or the anatomy of the\r\ntissues, whose revelations contributed not a little to the development\r\nof modern odontology.\r\n\r\nMARCELLO MALPIGHI (1628 to 1694), the celebrated Italian anatomist,\r\nwas the initiator of microscopic observations on the tissues, and is,\r\ntherefore, justly considered the founder of histology, within the range\r\nof which he made most important discoveries.[355]\r\n\r\nFRIEDERICH RUYSCH (1638 to 1731), professor at Amsterdam, rendered\r\nhis name illustrious particularly by bringing to a high degree\r\nof perfection the processes of anatomical preparations and of\r\nembalming.[356]\r\n\r\nHis magnificent injections, carried out with a method of his own\r\ninvention, enabled him to trace the most minute vascular ramifications\r\nand to demonstrate the existence of capillary vessels in parts where\r\ntheir presence had as yet never been suspected.\r\n\r\nRuysch studied accurately the anatomical constitution of the teeth, and\r\nespecially their vessels. He called attention to the membrane which\r\nlines the maxillary sinus, and discovered in it a number of bloodvessels.\r\n\r\nBut in addition to his purely anatomical observations, this author\r\nalso merits our consideration from the point of view of pathology. He\r\nconfirmed a most important fact to which allusion had already been made\r\nby preceding authors, that is, the atrophy of the alveolar parietes as\r\nfollowing on the extraction or on the falling out of teeth. Ruysch,\r\nhowever, makes the observation that atrophy of the alveolar parietes\r\nmay also precede the falling out of the teeth, and rather be the cause\r\nthan an effect of it. In such cases the teeth, before falling out,\r\nalways become more and more loosened, proportionately to the atrophic\r\nprocess. This pathological condition, against which none of the\r\nastringent remedies habitually used are of avail, is mostly considered,\r\nsays Ruysch, to be owing to scurvy; but, he adds, the accumulation\r\nof tartar may also be the cause of it. Substantially, Ruysch affirms\r\nthe relation existing between the accumulations of tartar and the\r\nproduction of that very frequent disease that was afterward named\r\nexpulsive periodontitis or alveolar pyorrhea.\r\n\r\nThis author also relates two cases of polypous affection of the\r\nmaxillary sinus. In one of these cases, the existence of a polypus in\r\nthe maxillary sinus was determined by Ruysch while dissecting a corpse.\r\nThe other case relates to a female patient upon whom two surgeons had\r\nperformed the extraction of several molar teeth and the extirpation of\r\nan epulis believed by them to be of a malignant character. After the\r\noperation they cauterized the diseased part to a great depth with a\r\nred-hot iron, reaching as far as the maxillary sinus, which remained\r\nopen, and from which Ruysch afterward extracted with his little finger\r\nseveral polypi.[357]\r\n\r\nANTONI VAN LEEUWENHOEK (1632 to 1723), like the preceding author, a\r\nDutchman, was the first maker of powerful microscopes, by means of\r\nwhich he made many important discoveries; among others, that of the\r\ntubular structure of the dentine or tooth bone. This discovery he made\r\nknown and demonstrated in the year 1678, before the Royal Society in\r\nLondon. In his description of the structure of the teeth, Leeuwenhoek\r\nsays that 600 to 700 of the dentinal tubuli have hardly the consistence\r\nof one hair of a beard.[358]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1683 he discovered in the tartar scraped from between\r\nthe teeth a form of microörganism upon which he laid special stress.\r\nThis observation he embodied in the form of a contribution which was\r\npresented to the Royal Society of London on September 14, 1683. This\r\npaper is of particular importance, not only because of the careful,\r\nobjective nature of the description given of the bodies seen by him,\r\nbut also for the illustrations which accompany it. From a perusal of\r\nthe text and an inspection of the plates, there remains little room for\r\ndoubt that the bodies described by Leeuwenhoek were not animalcules, as\r\nhe believed, but bacteria.[359]\r\n\r\nDOMENICO GAGLIARDI, professor of anatomy and of medicine at Rome,\r\npublished an excellent work on the anatomy of the bones,[360] in which\r\nhe occupies himself not only with the structure of bones, properly\r\nso called, but also with that of the teeth. He considers the enamel\r\nto be formed by parallel and contiguous fibers, coated, so to speak,\r\nby a concreted juice, _sui generis_, which acquires a much greater\r\nconsistence than that of the bones. Gagliardi says that by rubbing\r\nteeth hard together, or striking them with a steel, he was able to\r\nextract sparks from them.[361]\r\n\r\nJEAN DUVERNEY (1648 to 1730), a celebrated French anatomist, wrote\r\na good monograph[362] about the teeth. As different anatomists of\r\nthe sixteenth century had already done, he examined many fetal jaws\r\nin order to study in them the formation of the teeth. In relating\r\nhis observations, he says that he found in every alveolus a mass of\r\nsoft viscous matter, having the form of the tooth that is to derive\r\nfrom it, and which may be considered as its nucleus. This nucleus\r\nis entirely surrounded by a membrane, which the author likens to\r\nthat which surrounds the fetus, and to which he gives the name of\r\n_choroid membrane_. From the surface of the nucleus a gelatinous juice\r\ntranspires, which, thickening in layers, forms the enamel and the rest\r\nof the tooth. The choroid membrane is abundantly furnished with nerves,\r\nand with blood and lymph vessels. Into the interior of the teeth\r\npenetrate vascular and nervous branches which serve to maintain its\r\nvitality. In fetal jaws one finds, besides the germs of the deciduous\r\nteeth, also those of the permanent ones. The “choroid membrane” does\r\nnot follow the tooth when it issues from the alveolus; it remains\r\ninstead within the latter, forming the peridental membrane.\r\n\r\nDuverney says that in old people the root cavity diminishes in so\r\nconsiderable a manner, and the vessels are so compressed that they\r\nalmost entirely disappear. It is then that a period of decadence begins\r\nin the tooth, it is more feebly nourished, wears away more rapidly than\r\nhitherto, and becomes shorter.\r\n\r\nThe author also speaks of senile atrophy of the jaws, especially of the\r\nalveolar processes. With regard to this, he observes that if in old age\r\nthe lower jaw advances beyond the upper, this depends wholly on the\r\ndisappearance of the alveolar border, which projected more in the upper\r\nthan in the lower one.\r\n\r\nDuverney admits the existence of direct vascular relation between the\r\ngums and the teeth; because in the case of diseases of the gums it is\r\nrare not to find the teeth altered as well.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the development and nutrition of the teeth,\r\nDuverney finds much analogy between the tusks of the elephant, the\r\nteeth, properly so called, the feathers of birds, and the hair of\r\nmammifera.[363]\r\n\r\nGOTTFRIED BIDLOO, a Dutch anatomist, expresses the idea that the air\r\ncontributes, after the eruption of the teeth, to hardening them. He did\r\nnot, however, give any proof of this opinion of his.[364]\r\n\r\nCLOPTON HAVERS, an Englishman, wrote a book on osteology, by which he\r\nacquired great reputation,[365] and in which he treats as well of teeth\r\nand their structure. This author believes the enamel of the teeth to be\r\nof the nature of stone, and the ivory of the nature of bone. The dental\r\nroots, which, he says, are precisely of a bony nature, are covered over\r\nwith a periosteum, which is in close relation with the gums and with\r\nthe periosteum of the jaw bone. Clopton Havers held that the dental\r\nfollicle no longer furnishes any nourishment to the enamel from the\r\nmoment that this has reached its perfect formation. On the other hand,\r\nhe assures his readers that he has observed, through the microscope,\r\nnervous threads which, departing from the bulb of the tooth, traverse\r\nthe ivory through small canals, arriving thus at the periosteum. By\r\nthis anatomical disposition the sensibility of the teeth may, according\r\nto him, be explained.[366]\r\n\r\nHaving made this passing allusion to the anatomy of the teeth in the\r\nseventeenth century, we will now resume the illustration of those facts\r\nrelating to the pathological and curative part of the science.\r\n\r\nWALTER HARRIS, an Englishman, in a pamphlet on acute infantile\r\nmaladies,[367] recommends again, in cases of difficult dentition, the\r\nincision of the gums, a curative practice which had already fallen into\r\ndisuse.[368]\r\n\r\nIn the authors of that time we find registered a great number of cases\r\nof epulis. HIOB VAN MEEKREN speaks of an enormous tumor of the gum that\r\ndeveloped in consequence of a traumatic action which had occasioned\r\nthe loss of a tooth. Before deciding on the extirpation of the tumor,\r\nthe author thought well to pierce it with a bistoury, to be able to\r\njudge whether its ablation might not possibly give rise to a dangerous\r\nhemorrhage. The wound having bled but little, he proceeded to operate;\r\nbut the tumor was so large that it was necessary to remove it in\r\nvarious portions.[369]\r\n\r\nThe same author refers to a case of a soft epulis, bleeding easily,\r\nthat developed after a badly performed dental extraction. It was to\r\nbe foreseen that the ablation of such a tumor would give rise to an\r\nabundant hemorrhage. This was, however, staunched by simply using\r\nastringent powders, without having recourse to the actual cautery,\r\nwhich the operator had held in readiness.[370]\r\n\r\nDANIEL MAJOR, wishing to remove a large epulis by tying it, was\r\nobliged, in order to keep the ligature in position, to pass the thread\r\nthrough a circular incision made at the base of the tumor. He first\r\nused a thread of silk, afterward a silver one, and tightened the\r\nligature every day until the epulis fell off.[371]\r\n\r\nJOHANN ACOLUTHUS was obliged, in order to extirpate a large epulis,\r\nto previously split the labial commissure. After the ablation of the\r\nprincipal mass of the tumor, he destroyed the remaining part of it by\r\napplication of the red-hot iron.[372]\r\n\r\nOne reads of other cases of epulis in Stalpaart van der Wyl, Mercklin,\r\nPreuss, Bern, Valentini, etc. This last author even speaks of an\r\nepidemic of epulis. However this may be, it is very probable that\r\nepulis was much more frequent in past times than it is now, and this\r\nprobably depended partly on the incongruous modes of treating diseases\r\nof the mouth, and partly on the slight attention paid to cleanliness of\r\nthe teeth.\r\n\r\nKORNELIS VAN SOOLINGEN, a celebrated Dutch physician and surgeon,\r\nwho flourished toward the end of the seventeenth century, speaks\r\ncontemptuously of dental operations, and especially of extractions.\r\nHe says that such operations ought to be left to charlatans, used to\r\ntaking out teeth with the point of the sword, and to doing many other\r\nthings of like nature! This unjust contempt was at that time widely\r\ndiffused in the medical class, it resulted, however, substantially,\r\nfrom the great difficulties encountered by doctors and surgeons in\r\ngeneral, in performing the operation of extraction, owing to want of\r\npractice, and also from the desire to avoid the responsibility of the\r\naccidents to which the extraction might give rise; so true is this,\r\nthat an author of the preceding century, THEODOR ZWINGER (1538 to\r\n1588), a celebrated Swiss doctor and professor at Basle, had declared\r\nwith great frankness that the extracting of teeth ought to be left\r\nto barbers and charlatans, as it might easily occasion unpleasant\r\naccidents, such as fractures of the jaw, laceration of the gums,\r\nserious hemorrhage, and the like.\r\n\r\nIn spite of his contempt for practical dentistry, Kornelis van\r\nSoolingen takes the treatment of dental affections into attentive\r\nconsideration. For the stopping of carious teeth, he recommends a\r\nmixture similar to that which Rhazes had recommended many centuries\r\nbefore, that is, a cement of mastic and turpentine; because, says he,\r\nwhen the stopping is made with metallic substances, it is never so\r\nperfect as to entirely impede the penetration of moisture.\r\n\r\nGreat credit is due to Kornelis for having first brought into usage the\r\ninstrument makers’ emery wheels for grinding down sharp edges of teeth,\r\nthus initiating the practice of trepanning the teeth with sphere-shaped\r\nburs.[373]\r\n\r\nPAUL WURFBEIN refers to a case of extensive necrosis of the lower jaw,\r\nin which a certain Dr. Bürlin having removed the necrotic portion,\r\nregeneration of the bone took place.\r\n\r\nFRIEDERICH DEKKERS (1648 to 1730) refers a similar case, in which,\r\nalthough quite one-half of the lower jaw had been removed, the bone\r\nformed again completely.[374]\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN MARTIN, apothecary to the Prince de Condé, was the author of\r\na pamphlet on the teeth,[375] in which he gave a succinct description\r\nof these organs and spoke briefly of their diseases. He shows himself\r\ndecidedly opposed to the use of the file and to the application of\r\nfalse teeth, because, according to him, both of these things may be\r\nthe cause of great harm. With regard to the file, he says that nothing\r\nso easily tends to loosen the teeth as the use of this instrument, not\r\nto speak of various other inconveniences, among which is the danger of\r\nopening the interior cavity of the tooth.[376]\r\n\r\nMATTHIAS GOTTFRIED PURMANN (1648 to 1721), a celebrated surgeon of\r\nBreslau, was the first to make mention of models in dental prosthesis.\r\nAs to the mode in which these models were obtained, some admit as\r\nnatural that he first took a cast, and formed the model on this; but as\r\nPurmann does not hint in the least at such a process, the supposition\r\nis altogether gratuitous. Indeed, his description rather excludes any\r\nprobability that the model was taken from a cast. Here is the literal\r\ntranslation, as nearly as possible, of the passage in which Purmann\r\nspeaks of artificial teeth and of the mode of applying them.\r\n\r\n“The front teeth, or pronouncing teeth, ought, when they are wanting,\r\nto be substituted by artificial ones, in order to avoid defects of\r\npronunciation, as well as to obviate deformity of the mouth, and this\r\nis carried out in the following manner: One has other teeth made\r\nof bone, or of ivory, according to the number, the size, and the\r\nproportions of those wanting; for which purpose one may previously have\r\na model executed in wax, reproducing the particular conditions of the\r\nteeth and jaws, in order afterward to make and exactly adjust the whole\r\non the pattern of it; then, when the base of these teeth is well fitted\r\non the jaw and small holes have been made in the artificial teeth and\r\nalso in the natural ones next to them, one applies the artificial teeth\r\nin the existing void and fixes them as neatly as possible with a silver\r\nwire by the help of pincers.”[377]\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the author is here describing a prosthetic method,\r\nwhich he had never practised himself; and this results from the fact\r\nof his advising the perforation of the natural teeth for the passage\r\nof the silver wire destined to keep the prosthetic piece in its place.\r\nEvidently desiring to describe the mode practised by the specialists of\r\nthose days for fixing artificial teeth, he erroneously imagines that\r\nthe metal thread was passed through the holes drilled in the natural\r\nteeth; this would have been impossible, first, because of the atrocious\r\npain due to the sensibility of the dentine and of the dental pulp, and\r\nthen because of the pathological consequences to which the perforation\r\nof the teeth would have given rise. We may, therefore, surely hold that\r\nPurmann is simply describing, and not even accurately, a prosthetic\r\nmethod already in use among the specialists of that period.\r\n\r\nOn examination of the passage cited above—which, however, is not so\r\nclear as might be desired—it would appear that the models of which the\r\nauthor speaks were most probably quite different from those in use now.\r\nIt is almost certain that the specialists of those days first made a\r\nsketch of the prosthetic part to be constructed, using for the purpose\r\na piece of wax which they partly modelled with the hand and partly\r\ncarved; and after having tried on this model until it fitted perfectly\r\nin the mouth, and was in every way satisfactory, they probably passed\r\nit on to a craftsman to make an exact reproduction of it in bone or\r\nivory.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1632 a little book was published in Naples, having for its\r\ntitle, _Nuova et utilissima prattica di tutto quello ch’al diligente\r\nBarbiero s’appartiene; composta per Cintio d’Amato_.[378] This pamphlet\r\nwas reprinted in Venice in 1669, and again in Naples in 1671. We here\r\nmake mention of it, not for any special importance which it really has\r\nas regards the development of the dental art, but because of its being\r\nmost probably _the first book in the Italian language in which dental\r\nmatters are spoken of independently of general medicine and surgery_.\r\n\r\nTOMMASO ANTONIO RICCIO. The edition of 1671 was published under the\r\nsupervision of Tommaso Antonio Riccio, who was for many years a\r\ndisciple of Cintio d’Amato, and who greatly eulogizes his master and\r\npraises his work. He expresses himself in the following bombastic\r\nmanner: “This book, the offspring of Master Cintio d’Amato, excellent\r\nin the Barber’s Art, ought to find a place in the bosom of Eternity;\r\nbecause by reason of its having been twice given to the light, it has\r\nproved its worthiness to live forever in the memory of men, gaining\r\nfor itself, by its excellence, immortal glory before all such as are\r\npractised in the Art.”\r\n\r\nThe book—which consists of about one hundred and eighty pages, and\r\nis illustrated by several admirable engravings—contains, among other\r\nthings, two pages of verses, written by various authors, viz., by\r\nCintio d’Amato himself, by Giovan Battista Bergazzano, also a barber,\r\nand by others. The greater part of these verses are in praise of the\r\ntwo doctors and _Martyrs in Christ, Cosmos and Damianus, special\r\nprotectors of the Art and of the author_.\r\n\r\nThe verses of Cintio d’Amato reveal the possession of a literary and\r\npoetic culture above the ordinary, in spite of his being only a master\r\nbarber. As to his book, it may be considered, for the time in which it\r\nwas written, as an excellent treatise on so-called minor surgery. The\r\nauthor expounds, in a few chapters, the anatomical notions relating to\r\nbleeding; speaks at great length of this operation and of everything\r\nconcerning it; refers with much detail to all pertaining to the use of\r\nleeches, cupping, scarification, cauteries, issues, blistering, primary\r\ntreatment of the wounded, nursing of the sick, etc.; at the end of the\r\nbook there is also a long chapter on the embalming of corpses.\r\n\r\nAs regards the treatment of the teeth and gums the author dedicates\r\nsix chapters thereto, entitled, respectively: “On the relaxation of\r\nthe gums” (Chapter XXXVII); “Preparation for strengthening the gums\r\nand making the teeth firm” (Chapter XXXVIII); “On tartar and spots on\r\nthe teeth” (Chapter XXXIX); “Another preparation for whitening and\r\npreserving the teeth” (Chapter XL); “Mode of burning hart’s horn, very\r\nnecessary in preparations for the teeth” (Chapter XLVII); “‘Water of\r\nsalt,’ which makes the teeth white and is also good for ulcers of the\r\ngums” (Chapter XLIX).\r\n\r\nEvidently Cintio d’Amato treats of dental matters only within extremely\r\nrestricted limits. He tells us nothing with regard to the treatment of\r\ntoothache, nothing about caries, about prosthesis, and, what is still\r\nmore remarkable, he does not allude even in passing to the extraction\r\nof teeth. Now, if in a book treating _of all that which appertains to\r\nthe diligent barber_, the most important dental subjects are passed\r\nover in silence, this shows that, contrary to the generally diffused\r\nopinion of today, the dental art was not at that time (at least not in\r\nItaly) exclusively, or even in great part, in the hands of the barber.\r\nEven at that time there must have been dental specialists, and the\r\nproof of this may be found in d’Amato’s book itself, in the chapter\r\nentitled “Necessity and Origin of the Barber’s Art.”[379] The author,\r\nafter having spoken of the divisions which the practice of the medical\r\nart had undergone from the most remote times, and after having alluded\r\nto the great number of parts into which Medicine was divided in the\r\ntime of Galen, adds: “Which may also be seen in our own times, for as\r\nmany as are the members of the human body, so many are nowadays the\r\nvarious kinds of doctors and of medicines. Some are for the teeth,\r\nsome are for the ears, some for sexual maladies, others are ordinary\r\ndoctors, others cure cataracts, others ruptures and stone, some make\r\nnew ears, lips, noses, and others remedy harelips.”\r\n\r\nAs, under the generic name of doctors, Cintio d’Amato also comprises\r\nsurgeons, it results from the above passage that in his time, that\r\nis, in the seventeenth century, there were surgeons who dedicated\r\nthemselves specially to the treatment of the teeth; there were, in\r\nfact, dentists; and even admitting that the greater number of these\r\nwere no better than simple tooth-pullers, this cannot be true of\r\nthem all indiscriminately. Cintio d’Amato’s book demonstrates in the\r\nmost vivid manner that even among the barber and phlebotomist class,\r\nthat is, among the practitioners of minor surgery, there were, at\r\nthat time, men of considerable culture. This ought to hold good with\r\nstill greater reason concerning surgeons, whose professional level\r\nwas certainly superior to that of barbers;[380] and as dentists\r\nbelonged to the class of surgeons (whence the denomination still in\r\nuse of “surgeon-dentist”), it is but natural to admit that besides\r\nthe ignorant tooth-puller there were even then more or less cultured\r\ndentists well capable of treating dental diseases and performing dental\r\noperations within the limits permitted by the knowledge of the times.\r\n\r\nThe six chapters in which Cintio d’Amato speaks of matters referring\r\nto the teeth do not contain anything whatever of real importance;\r\nnotwithstanding this, we will here refer to the beginning of Chapter\r\nXXXIX, treating “Of tartar and spots on the teeth,” because it is of\r\nsome historical interest:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TOOTH-PULLER AT A PUBLIC PLACE IN HOLLAND\r\n\r\n_From an engraving of the Seventeenth Century._]\r\n\r\n“It happens in general that owing to vapors that rise from the stomach,\r\na certain deposit is formed on the teeth, which may be perceived by\r\nrubbing them with a rough cloth on waking. One ought, therefore, to\r\nrub and clean them every morning, for, if one is not aware of this, or\r\nconsiders it of little account, the teeth become discolored and covered\r\nwith a thick tartar, which often causes them to decay and to fall out.\r\nIt is then necessary that the diligent barber should remove the said\r\ntartar with the instruments destined for this purpose.”\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the practice of the dental art was for the most\r\npart in other hands than in the barber’s. Nevertheless, the important\r\noperation of the removal of tartar was also carried out by him. If,\r\ntherefore, even the barbers, who were not in the least the true\r\nrepresentatives of the dental art of that period, carried out such an\r\nimportant operation, it may logically be argued from this, in support\r\nof what we have said before, that the sphere of action of the true\r\ndental specialists of those times (especially of the best among them)\r\nwas not at all so limited as imagined by those who affirm that in past\r\ntimes dentists properly so called did not exist, but only tooth-pullers.\r\n\r\nThe barbers, however, having become, in a certain manner, members of\r\nthe medical class, sought to extend their sphere of action, and it is\r\nprobable that in a later period than that of Tiberio Malfi and Cintio\r\nd’Amato they invaded the whole field of dental activity; for which\r\nreason, when the barber’s art came down to a very low level, the dental\r\nart must have degenerated, too, and have been represented for a certain\r\ntime only by ignorant barbers and tooth-pullers. Vicissitudes similar\r\nto these have occurred in different epochs, not only in various parts\r\nof Italy, but also in other countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nFLEURIMOND. In 1682 a little book on dental hygiene was published\r\nin Paris by a certain Fleurimond, the title of which was: _Moyens\r\nde conserver les dents belles et bonnes_. Portal, in his history of\r\nanatomy and surgery, makes mention of this pamphlet, and, briefly\r\nalluding to certain parts of it, he says: “The author proves by\r\nobservation that acids act upon the enamel of the teeth. He makes some\r\nvery just reflections upon dentition. Fleurimond speaks of a tooth\r\npowder invented by him, but does not say how compounded.”[381]\r\n\r\nIn fact, it seems that this pamphlet was compiled from a commercial\r\npoint of view, viz., that of making known the special tooth powder\r\ninvented by the author. The era of advertisement had already begun!\r\n\r\nANTON NUCK (1650 to 1692), a Dutch surgeon and anatomist, who taught\r\nmost ably in the University of Leyden, devoted great attention to\r\ndental surgery and prosthesis. Relative to the extraction of teeth,\r\nhe says that, in order to be able to carry out this most important\r\noperation, an exact anatomical knowledge of the alveoli and of the\r\nteeth themselves is required. He insists on a principle of capital\r\nimportance that has only had its full application in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, viz., that the instruments to be used for the extraction of\r\nteeth ought to vary according to the tooth to be extracted. For the\r\nremoval of the incisors, he says, the “goat’s foot” should have the\r\npreference; the canines ought to be extracted with the common dental\r\nforceps, but sometimes, when they are decayed, they may be extracted\r\nwith greater security with the pelican; for the small molars the\r\nstraight-branched pelican is to be preferred, for the large molars the\r\ncurved pelican; as to the extraction of roots or of splinters of bone,\r\nthis ought to be carried out with the _rostrum corvinum_.\r\n\r\nThe author counsels never to extract teeth during pregnancy, except\r\nunder circumstances of the greatest urgency, and especially to avoid\r\nthe extracting of the upper canines (or eye teeth), this being capable\r\nof producing pernicious effect on the visual organs of the fetus!\r\n\r\nThe best way of obtaining the cessation of a violent toothache\r\nwithout having recourse to extraction is, according to the author,\r\ncauterization of the antitragus, an operation which he carried out\r\nwith a special cauterizing instrument, made to pass through a small\r\ntube, the better to localize and to limit the action of the red-hot\r\niron. With regard to this means of cure already recommended by other\r\nauthors, we may remark that, although it seems ridiculous at first\r\nsight, and although no one could be so senseless as to make use of it\r\nin our days, nevertheless, for the times of which we are writing, when\r\nthe curing of toothache was in a great measure effected by indirect\r\nmeans, this remedy might well stand on a level with many others,\r\nand was not perhaps altogether inefficacious. It is a sufficiently\r\nwell-known physiological fact that the application of a strong stimulus\r\nin one part of the body may diminish or suppress a painful sensation in\r\nanother part of the organism. It is an equally well-known fact that it\r\nis in no way a matter of indifference, in producing this phenomenon,\r\nto what part the stimulus be applied, especially because of the great\r\ndifference existing in the relations of the several parts of the body\r\nwith the brain—the centre of sensation. It is, therefore, very possible\r\nthat the cauterization of the antitragus may really have the effect of\r\ncausing strong toothache to cease, at least temporarily.\r\n\r\nNuck used a variety of remedies to arrest dental hemorrhage, such as\r\ntinder, burnt linen, vitriol, sulphuric acid and the cauterizing iron.\r\n\r\nAs to the use of the file, far from rejecting it entirely, as does\r\nMartin, he holds it necessary in many cases for planing down points and\r\nsharp edges of broken teeth, as well as for removing, at least in a\r\nmeasure, the inconvenience and deformed appearance caused by irregular\r\nteeth. He says the file may be used without causing the slightest\r\nharm, if one takes care not to approach the inner cavity of the tooth\r\ntoo nearly, and above all not to penetrate right to it, which would\r\ngive rise to intolerable pain. Such an accident, he adds, may happen\r\nmuch more easily when, instead of using the file, whole pieces of teeth\r\nare removed with the excising forceps.\r\n\r\nThis author acquaints us with a tooth powder, much used in his time,\r\nespecially by Parisian ladies. The ingredients were powdered cuttle\r\nfish, coral powder, cream of tartar, Armenian bole, and powder of red\r\nroses.\r\n\r\nAt that time artificial teeth were generally made of ivory; Nuck,\r\nhowever, observes that it soon becomes yellow by the action of food\r\nand drink, and of the saliva itself. He therefore recommends, instead,\r\nthe use of hippopotamus’ tusks, giving the preference to the whitest.\r\nAccording to Nuck, artificial teeth made of hippopotamus’ tusks would\r\nbe capable of preserving their color even for seventy years. In the\r\ncase of all the teeth of the lower jaw being wanting, the entire dental\r\narch ought to be framed in with a single piece of ivory or tusk of\r\nhippopotamus.[382]\r\n\r\nCARLO MUSITANO, a celebrated Neapolitan doctor (1635 to 1714).\r\nAccording to Carlo Musitano, the real cause of toothache consists in\r\nthe irritant action of saline or acid particles on the extremely thin\r\nmembrane that lines the alveoli or on the exquisitely sensitive nerves\r\nof the teeth. As he believes, these particles have an angular form,\r\nsometimes pointed or even hooked, and they reach the sensitive parts\r\neither directly from the outside, through the air, the food or drink\r\n(especially when the teeth are already decayed), or else through the\r\nblood and other humors, which often, by reason of their deteriorated\r\nquality, contain great quantities of such irritant particles.\r\n\r\nAmong the various influences which may be conducive to toothache,\r\natmospheric conditions ought also to be included; thus, says the\r\nauthor, the inhabitants of the Baltic littorals, and other northern\r\npeoples, are very subject to toothache, for the reason that in those\r\nregions the air contains, in abundance, saline particles of various\r\nkinds which penetrate into the organism by the act of respiration. It\r\nis said, on the contrary, that in Egypt, where the air is remarkably\r\nmild, the teeth are not subject either to pain or to decay.\r\n\r\nMusitano, too, believes in worms in the teeth, but does not admit, as\r\npreceding authors had done, that they generate spontaneously. He holds\r\ninstead that they result from the eggs of flies and other insects,\r\nwhich, together with food, are introduced into the carious cavities and\r\nthere develop by the heat of the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of toothache ought to differ according to its causes. If\r\nthe pain be owing to acidity, one uses medicines adapted for tempering\r\nthe acids; if it be owing to the action of saline substances, one has\r\nrecourse to remedies which dissolve them; if to worms, to such remedies\r\nas destroy them, and so on. Purgatives and bleeding ought, however,\r\nnever to be used as remedies against toothache; for, far from doing\r\ngood, they often do harm. As to the other torments usually inflicted on\r\npoor sufferers, they are the punishment of their sins, for God often\r\ngives the unrighteous into the hands of doctors! (This language will\r\nperhaps appear less strange when the reader comes to know that Carlo\r\nMusitano was at one and the same time priest and physician!)\r\n\r\nAfter a lengthy enumeration of medicaments to be used against\r\ntoothache, which we pass over in silence because already known, the\r\nauthor speaks of two remedies which carry us back absolutely to the\r\ndays of Pliny! He relates us a fact experienced by himself, that, by\r\ntouching an aching tooth with the leg of a frog completely cleaned of\r\nthe flesh, the pain ceases altogether. Also, if the aching tooth be\r\ntouched with the root of a tooth extracted from the jaw of a corpse,\r\nthe pain ceases, the tooth becomes as cold as ice, and often, after a\r\ncertain time, it falls to pieces.\r\n\r\nAs to worms, the best mode of destroying them is by using bitter\r\nsubstances, such as myrrh, aloes, colocynth, _centaurea minor_, etc.,\r\nbut sometimes the use of sweet substances, such as honey, is a good\r\nmeans of drawing them out of the carious cavities!\r\n\r\nMusitano also cites a great number of remedies against the setting on\r\nedge of the teeth. Among the best of these he mentions urine applied to\r\nthe teeth whilst still warm! Alkali in general, and particularly lye,\r\nsuch as is used for washing purposes, are good remedies against the\r\nsetting on edge of the teeth.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of loose teeth ought to vary according to whether this\r\npathological condition depends on old age, or on scurvy, on syphilis,\r\non superabundance of humors, etc. Sometimes, especially in old persons,\r\nit may be useful to bind the teeth with gold wire, in order to prevent\r\ntheir falling out, but this operation must be very ably performed,\r\notherwise it may give rise to inflammation.\r\n\r\nRelative to artificial teeth, Musitano says that they are made of ivory\r\nor hippopotamus tusks; of these last he does not speak as of a novelty;\r\nwe may, therefore, deem it probable that hippopotamus tusks were used\r\nin Naples for making artificial teeth even before the Dutchman Anton\r\nNuck (contemporary of Musitano) made mention of them in his writings.\r\n\r\nIn cases of difficult dentition, the best remedy, according to\r\nMusitano, for facilitating the eruption of the teeth consists in\r\nfriction of the gums, once, or at most twice, with blood drawn fresh\r\nfrom the comb of a cock! If, however, even this remedy fails to\r\nproduce the desired effect, it will then be necessary to lance the gum\r\nat the point where the tooth is to erupt, or to press it hard with the\r\nthumb, that the tooth may the easier come through.\r\n\r\nThe sole merit of this author (as to what concerns our specialty)\r\nconsists in his having declared bleeding useless, or even harmful in\r\nthe treatment of toothache, and, besides, in his having recommended,\r\nwith great warmth and in most impressive terms, cleanliness of the\r\nteeth. What is more beautiful, says he, than a mouth furnished with\r\nwhite teeth, similar to so many pearls? And what is more abominable\r\nthan black or livid teeth, covered with a fetid deposit or with tartar?\r\nUnclean teeth spoil the appearance of the person, and nauseate those\r\nwho behold them.[383]\r\n\r\nWILLIAM COWPER (1666 to 1709). Toward the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury the celebrated English doctor and anatomist, William Cowper,\r\nopened up a new field of action to oral surgery by inaugurating the\r\nrational treatment of the diseases of the maxillary sinus. In order to\r\nempty Highmore’s antrum of deposits and to be able to carry out the\r\nnecessary irrigations, he extracted in most cases the first permanent\r\nmolar, and then penetrated through its alveolus into the sinus with a\r\npointed instrument.\r\n\r\nJAMES DRAKE, also an Englishman and a contemporary of Cowper, operated\r\nin the same manner; and it was this author who made known in a book\r\nof his[384] the operative method of Cowper; for which reason the\r\nabove-mentioned proceeding is sometimes called “the Cowper-Drake\r\noperation.” A certain time elapsed, however, before it became generally\r\nknown. Thus, in a book published by JOHANN HOFFMANN in 1713 there is no\r\nmention made of this operation, albeit the author refers therein[385]\r\nto the case of a young girl, one of whose canine teeth having been\r\nextracted by him, there ensued a considerable flow of whitish pus from\r\nthe maxillary sinus. In speaking of this case, Hoffmann stigmatizes\r\nmany of the surgeons of his time who were not acquainted with the\r\nexistence of Highmore’s antrum, and therefore, in cases of patients\r\nwhose teeth had fallen out as an effect of syphilis, if they happened\r\nto penetrate with the sound into the maxillary sinus, believed this to\r\nbe an accidental excavation of the bone, produced by caries.\r\n\r\nHowever, the honor of having initiated the rational treatment of\r\ndiseases of the maxillary sinus is not exclusively due to William\r\nCowper and to James Drake; a large share is also due to the celebrated\r\nGerman physician and anatomist, Heinrich Meibom. The mucous membrane\r\nof the maxillary sinus was considered by him as the real point of\r\ndeparture of the diseases which occur in this cavity, it being liable\r\nto become inflamed and to suppurate, thus giving rise to much pain and\r\nto various accidents. Meibom rejects the operation of Molinetti, that\r\nis, the trepanning of the cavity from the front, the lesion produced\r\nin the soft parts of the face being likely to give rise to unpleasant\r\nconsequences. “Some, he adds, try the introduction of medicated vapors\r\ninto the antrum,[386] but the best way is to _open the maxillary sinus\r\nby extracting a tooth, as the pus generally makes its way as far as\r\nthe roots of the teeth_.”[387] The author says that his father, who\r\nwas also a physician, had already used the above method with success.\r\nHe does not speak at all of the artificial opening of the antrum by\r\nperforation; but, as is well known, this is not necessary in many\r\ncases, so that, even now, the operation is sometimes reduced to\r\nprocuring the opening of the sinus by the simple extraction of a tooth,\r\nas was, in fact, practised by Heinrich Meibom and his father.\r\n\r\nSeeing that Heinrich Meibom was born twenty-eight years before William\r\nCowper, and was already known to the scientific world when Cowper was\r\nstill a child, it is very probable that his operative method, having\r\ncome to the knowledge of the latter, was only followed up and perfected\r\nby him.\r\n\r\nCHARLES ST. YVES (1667 to 1733), oculist in Paris, records an\r\ninteresting case of a secondary affection of the maxillary sinus.\r\nThe point of departure of the evil was an abscess in the orbit.\r\nThe suppurative process, after having produced an erosion and the\r\nperforation of the orbital plane, had reached by propagation the antrum\r\nof Highmore, whence the pus took its way, issuing through the nose.\r\nSt. Yves had a molar tooth extracted on the affected side (we do not\r\nknow which side it was), after which, day by day, he made injections\r\nof detersive liquids through the orbital fistula, which returned\r\nconstantly through the alveolus of the extracted tooth. By this means\r\nthe cure of the patient was obtained.[388]\r\n\r\nCHRISTOPHER SCHELHAMMER (1649 to 1716), who was professor in various\r\nGerman universities, and distinguished himself specially as an\r\nanatomist and as an ear doctor, strongly recommends stopping decayed\r\nteeth as the best means of causing pain to cease. If, however, the\r\nstopping does not hold, by reason of the cavity being too extended,\r\nit is then necessary, says Schelhammer, to extract the tooth; this,\r\nhowever, may very well be stopped after extraction, and then\r\nreplanted, for it will take root again, but no longer be the cause of\r\nany pain.[389]\r\n\r\nPIERRE DIONIS, a celebrated surgeon and anatomist of Paris (died 1718),\r\nin his _Anatomie de l’homme_,[390] admits the possibility of a double\r\ndental series, holding the case, however, to be of very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nAnother work of his, entitled _Cours d’operations de Chirurgie_,\r\nwherein he treats very extensively of diseases of the teeth and mouth,\r\nand their surgical cure, is of much more importance in relation\r\nto dentistry. He recognizes the high importance of this part of\r\nsurgery, but expresses the opinion that one of the dental operations,\r\nthat is the extraction of teeth, ought to be left entirely to the\r\ntooth-pullers, not only because they are, by reason of great practice,\r\nbetter qualified to perform it than general surgeons, but also because\r\nthe output of force required for this tooth-pulling operation renders\r\nthe hand heavy and tremulous, and, lastly, because, according to him,\r\nit always has something of charlatanism about it. (This is a luminous\r\nexample of how preconceived ideas can influence the minds even of men\r\nof the greatest talent.)\r\n\r\nPierre Dionis, like many of the preceding authors, had frequently\r\noccasion to observe cases of epulis. He speaks at great length of the\r\ntreatment of this affection, as well as of parulis, but says nothing on\r\nthe subject of sufficient importance to be worth recording.\r\n\r\nDental operations, according to Dionis, are of seven kinds:\r\n\r\n1. _The opening of the dental arches in the case of spasmodic\r\nconstriction of the jaws._ This operation, of the greatest importance\r\nfor nourishing and keeping patients alive, is carried out by means of a\r\nlever and of a screw dilator.\r\n\r\n2. _The cleaning of the teeth._ For this, as for the other operations,\r\nsays Dionis, a certain amount of skill is required. The author advises\r\nthe use of gold instruments if one be called upon to clean the teeth of\r\npersons of rank. This appears rather strange in the present levelling\r\ntimes, but Pierre Dionis lived in the days of Louis XIV, whose doctor\r\nhe was, that is, in a period of unbridled luxury, when the nobles and\r\nthose in power would have nothing in common with the lower classes.\r\n\r\n3. _Operations for the preservation of the teeth._ These, says Dionis,\r\nare of the greatest importance, it being necessary to oppose a barrier\r\nto the destructive processes of the teeth. Caries, when so situated\r\nas to permit of it, ought to be scraped away; for approximal caries\r\none ought to have recourse to the file; in the case of caries of the\r\ntriturating surfaces, cauterization should be used, by applying a drop\r\nof oil of vitriol with a miniature paint brush. Should the caries,\r\nhowever, be in a very advanced stage, it is better to make use of the\r\ncauterizing iron. But in cases of intense and persistent pain there is\r\nno other remedy than extraction.\r\n\r\n4. _Stopping of the carious cavity._ Dionis does not enumerate this\r\noperation among those intended for the preservation of the teeth.\r\nAt that period, this operation was performed solely with a view to\r\npreventing the penetration into and the retention within the carious\r\ncavity of alimentary substances, and the disadvantages caused thereby.\r\nThe carious process, says the author, often ceases altogether, and\r\nthe pain then generally ceases also. However, as the residual cavity\r\noften becomes troublesome in various ways, among others by making the\r\nbreath offensive, it is better to stop it. For this purpose, gold or\r\nsilver leaf is generally made use of; but this mode of stopping is not\r\ndurable, because gold or silver in leaf is apt to become loosened and\r\nfall out. It is therefore preferable, says Dionis, to make a stopping\r\nwith a piece of gold or silver corresponding in size and shape to the\r\ncavity.[391] Many, he adds, prefer lead as a stopping, on account of\r\nits softness, whilst others simply use wax.\r\n\r\n5. _The use of the file._ The indications given by Pierre Dionis for\r\nusing the file do not differ from those we find in other authors.\r\nDionis warns, however, against using the file to level down a tooth\r\nwhich has become lengthened through the loss of its antagonist, for\r\nafter a certain time it would again project above the level of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n6. _Extraction._ This operation, says Dionis, ought not to be performed\r\ntoo lightly, but only in those cases in which it is really necessary;\r\nthat is, when a tooth is the cause of insupportable pain and its crown\r\nis almost entirely worn away; when nothing remains of a tooth but its\r\nroot; when a tooth is so loosened in its socket as to leave no hope\r\nof its again becoming firm; when supernumerary teeth or irregularly\r\nplanted teeth give rise to inconvenience or deformity; and lastly, to\r\nremove deciduous teeth that have become loosened. The opinion that\r\nif the loosened milk teeth be not promptly extracted they cause the\r\npermanent teeth to grow irregularly, is, however, considered by Dionis\r\nto be a prejudice.\r\n\r\nDionis strongly doubts whether a tooth that has been extracted\r\nand replanted can really take root again, as had been affirmed by\r\nDupont, Pomaret, and other authors. This shows that Dionis had had no\r\nexperience on this point.\r\n\r\n7. _The application of artificial teeth._ These teeth, says Dionis,\r\nare generally made of ivory, but may also be made of ox bone, which\r\nis less liable to turn yellow than ivory. He does not mention the\r\nuse of hippopotamus tusks, but we learn from him that one Guillemeau\r\nmade artificial teeth with a composition of his own invention, which\r\nwas obtained by fusing together white wax and a small quantity of\r\ngum elemi, and then adding ground mastic, powder of white coral and\r\nof pearls. This fact is, as everyone can see, most important, for it\r\nconstitutes the first step toward the manufacture and use of mineral\r\nteeth. Dionis tells us that the teeth made of Guillemeau’s composition\r\nnever became yellow, and that it was also very good for stopping\r\ndecayed teeth.[392] It would seem, therefore, that it could be used as\r\ncement is now used.\r\n\r\nThe Guillemeau of whom Dionis speaks is probably Jacques Guillemeau,\r\nthe author of a book now no longer to be found, which was translated\r\nfrom the French, first into Dutch, and afterward into German. Crowley,\r\nin his _Dental Bibliography_, only quotes the German edition, published\r\nat Dresden in 1710, the title of which runs thus: _Der aufrichtige\r\nAugen und Zahnarzt_.[393]\r\n\r\nJEAN VERDUC, also a Frenchman, relates a case of the surgeon\r\nCarmeline,[394] analogous to that of Denis Pomaret, in which a sound\r\ntooth which had been extracted by mistake was immediately replanted and\r\ntook root again, becoming quite firm. However, Verduc does not speak\r\nof replantation as a special method of cure, but merely refers to the\r\nabove case incidentally in speaking of the extraction of teeth. He\r\nconsiders this operation a most dangerous one, and advises not having\r\nrecourse to it except in cases of utmost necessity. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, Verduc gives us to understand that teeth were drawn with\r\nsufficient ability by most of the operators of the time, and precisely\r\nbecause of this he omits describing the manner of performing the\r\noperation. According to Verduc, the drawing of teeth is often of little\r\nor no advantage against toothache.[395] In proof of this assertion he\r\nrelates the case of a hypochondriac, who little by little had as many\r\nas eighteen teeth extracted, without, however, getting the better or\r\nthe wiser; but as this case does not prove anything at all, one is\r\ndisposed to think that Verduc, in relating it, had the intention of\r\nbeing humorous.\r\n\r\nMONSIEUR DE LAVAUGUYON. To another French surgeon, Monsieur de\r\nLavauguyon, also a contemporary of Dionis, belongs the merit of having\r\ndeclared useless, in the greater number of cases, the practice, at that\r\ntime general, of separating the gums from the tooth before proceeding\r\nto the extraction of the latter. He says that this is only necessary\r\nwhen a tooth, either because broken or because its crown emerges too\r\nlittle above the gum, offers an insufficient hold for the pelican.[396]\r\n\r\nOur historical survey has now reached the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Embracing at a glance the whole of this last period of\r\ntime, we remark, among many facts of minor importance, some events\r\nwhich, in the history of the development of dental art, stand out in\r\nstrong relief. Such are the replantation of teeth used as a special\r\ncurative method by Dupont and others; the method of plugging in cases\r\nof alveolar hemorrhage, the credit of which is due to Rivière and to\r\nTulpius; the description of the maxillary sinus given by Highmore; the\r\nrational treatment of affections of the antrum, inaugurated by Meibom,\r\nCowper, and Drake; the researches into the microscopic structure of\r\nthe teeth, brilliantly initiated by Leeuwenhoek, who discovered the\r\ndentinal tubuli; the use of models introduced by Purmann into the\r\nworkmanship of prosthetic pieces; the employment of hippopotamus’\r\ntusks in making artificial teeth, first recommended by Nuck; and the\r\ninvention of Guillemeau, which was the first step toward the use of\r\nmineral teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lorenz Heister.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough there have been, even from the most remote times, individuals\r\nwho have dedicated themselves exclusively to the cure of dental\r\nmaladies, or to repairing the losses of the dental system by artificial\r\nmeans, and notwithstanding the progress gradually accomplished in this\r\nbranch of the medical art, which progress was especially remarkable\r\nduring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, it is not to be denied\r\nthat, up to the beginning of the eighteenth century, dentistry was, in\r\ngreat part, considered one with medicine and surgery in general. It is\r\nbut natural that dental art (and the same may be said of every special\r\nbranch of medicine) could not assume a real individuality until it had\r\nattained to the higher grades of its development. As a matter of fact,\r\ndentistry, toward the end of the seventeenth century, was already a\r\ntrue specialty, although it counted but few worthy representatives\r\nat that time. The definite separation between the science and art of\r\ndentistry and general medicine and surgery, although it may have been\r\nretarded, could not fail to take place; and this, as we shall presently\r\nsee, was effected by the celebrated French dentist Pierre Fauchard.\r\n\r\nBut, to remain faithful to chronological order, we will first speak\r\nbriefly of some other writers.\r\n\r\nLUDWIG CRON, a barber of Leipsic, in a pamphlet published in 1717,\r\nwith the title _The barber’s apprentice versed in bleeding and tooth\r\npulling_,[397] declares, in a still more emphatic and general way than\r\nDe Lavauguyon, that it is useless to detach the gum before proceeding\r\nto extract a tooth. This barber, strong in his own experience, dares\r\nto assert absolutely useless this ancient practice, advised first by\r\nCornelius Celsus, and recommended after him, and in homage to his\r\nauthority, by many other writers. It is, therefore, possible that\r\neven previous to Cron and De Lavauguyon many operators had dispensed\r\nwith the practice recommended by Celsus, although this had become an\r\naccepted canon of the high medical profession.\r\n\r\nLORENZ HEISTER (1683 to 1758), of Frankfort-am-Main, one of the most\r\ncelebrated surgeons of the eighteenth century, wrote a dissertation on\r\ntoothache,[398] treating besides very extensively of dental affections\r\nand their cure in a masterly work on surgery, published for the first\r\ntime in 1718, and which went through numerous editions in various\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\nWhen the caries of a tooth is superficial, Heister advises the removal\r\nof the decayed part with the file; or, when the caries is deep down,\r\nthe cavity ought first to be well cleaned with a toothpick or other\r\nlike instrument, then filled with heated white wax, or mastic, the\r\nstopping being renewed as often as may be necessary. When a molar tooth\r\nis decayed, especially in the centre, the best way, says Heister, is to\r\nfill it with gold or lead leaf, or with a piece of the latter fitting\r\ninto the cavity. If the carious cavity of a painful molar cannot be\r\ncleaned as it ought to be, the dropping of a little oil of cloves or\r\nof cinnamon or of guaiacum into it will be found useful, or even a\r\nfew drops of spirit of vitriol; for in this manner one obtains at the\r\nsame time the double advantage of destroying the impurities contained\r\nin the carious cavity and of soothing the pain. But if by chance the\r\npain should persist, recourse must be had to the cauterizing iron, or\r\nto extraction. Sometimes, however, even the most violent toothache\r\ncan be made to cease, either by scarifying the gums (a method already\r\nrecommended by Pliny), by cauterizing the antitragus, or by pressing\r\nthe aching tooth hard between the fingers, as Schelhammer[399] and some\r\nother writers had advised.\r\n\r\nHeister writes at length on the extraction of teeth, on the indications\r\nand counterindications appertaining thereto, on the instruments with\r\nwhich the operation should be carried out, and so on. Regarding the\r\nposition of the patients, he thinks it best to place them on a low\r\nseat or on the ground, if the tooth to be extracted is situated in the\r\nlower jaw, but if an upper tooth is to be extracted, patients should be\r\nplaced on a chair or on a bed.\r\n\r\nMovable prosthetic pieces are mentioned for the first time by this\r\nauthor. Although he is very concise in his manner of speaking of\r\nartificial teeth (this indicating that dental prosthesis was considered\r\noutside the sphere of action of the general surgeon), we nevertheless\r\nlearn from him that partial sets of teeth made of ivory or hippopotamus\r\ntusks, and without special appliances for fixing them, were then in\r\nuse, which, when applied in the void between the neighboring teeth,\r\nwere maintained in position simply by their form. The author advises\r\nkeeping prosthetic pieces very clean, removing them every evening\r\nbefore going to bed, and not putting them back in the mouth until they\r\nhave been well cleaned.\r\n\r\nHeister also speaks of nasal prosthesis; this was then carried out by\r\napplying noses made of wood or of silver, properly painted. In cases\r\nof trismus, this author altogether rejects the forcible opening of\r\nthe jaws by means of screw dilators and such like instruments, as they\r\nact too violently, and, according to him, only aggravate the morbid\r\ncondition. Even the extraction of a tooth is useless in such cases, as\r\nthe patient can always absorb a certain quantity of liquid food through\r\nthe closed teeth. On the other hand, the author expresses himself in\r\nfavor of the incision of the gums in cases of difficult dentition.\r\nAccording to him, convulsions and the other nervous symptoms which\r\nchildren are subject to during the period of dentition depend wholly\r\non the hardness and strained condition of the gum. It is, therefore,\r\nnatural that the symptoms should disappear when an incision of the\r\ngums, reaching to the tooth that is coming through, has caused the\r\ntension to cease.\r\n\r\nThe author speaks very particularly of the treatment of epulis and\r\nparulis; but his views on this subject contain nothing of great\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nRENÉ JACQUES CROISSANT DE GARENGEOT (1688 to 1759), the celebrated\r\nFrench surgeon, speaks very little of dental surgery in his works. He\r\ndeclares himself averse to the carrying out of too many operations on\r\nthe teeth, and especially disapproves the use of the file, because,\r\naccording to him, it ruins the enamel.[400] For a long time, especially\r\nin France, Garengeot was believed to have been the inventor of the\r\nkey known by his name; but he merely perfected this instrument. In\r\nfact, through a later author, Lecluse, it clearly results that the\r\nkey existed before Garengeot. “For extracting,” writes Lecluse, “one\r\nmay make use of the pelican that Garengeot has constructed on the\r\nEnglish key.” In a note, he afterward adds, “that the English key is\r\nan instrument used by dentists in England.” However, it is not in the\r\nleast certain that the key is really an instrument of English origin.\r\n\r\nLoder, who wrote at the end of the eighteenth century, informs us that\r\nthe so-called English key was called the German key in England; it is,\r\ntherefore, not improbable, that this instrument, as some maintain, had\r\nits origin in Germany.[401]\r\n\r\nJOHANN JUNKER (1679 to 1759), professor of medicine at the University\r\nof Halle, wrote on dental maladies, not only in a treatise on surgery,\r\npublished in 1721, but also in three dissertations which were published\r\nsome time later, and were entitled respectively: _De affectibus\r\ndentium_ (1740), _De dentitione difficili_ (1745), _De odontalgia_\r\n(1746). The author, however, for the most part, only repeats things\r\nalready known; his writings have, therefore, little or no importance\r\nfor us. He counsels the Cowper-Drake operation in treating the\r\naffections of Highmore’s antrum; in carrying out the operation,\r\nhowever, he thinks the extraction of the second molar to be preferable\r\nto that of the first. To prevent the formation of tartar on the teeth,\r\nhe advises assiduous care in keeping the mouth clean, and recommends,\r\namong other things, rubbing the teeth with sage. He disapproves having\r\nrecourse too readily to metal instruments to remove tartar from the\r\nteeth, because, according to him, it favors the production of dental\r\ncaries. He holds it dangerous to extract the upper or lower canines\r\nwhen they are not loose, as, by reason of the depth of their roots an\r\ninjury to the surrounding nerves may be the result, which not only\r\nmight cause great pain, but in the case of the upper canines might lead\r\nto inflammation of the eye, and even of the dura mater!\r\n\r\nWhen the caries is incipient, Junker advises rubbing the teeth several\r\ntimes a day for some time with common salt, in order that this should\r\npenetrate into their structure.[402]\r\n\r\nGUILLAUME MAQUEST DE LA MOTTE (1655 to 1737), a distinguished French\r\nsurgeon and the writer of an excellent treatise (_Traité complet de\r\nchirurgie_, Paris, 1722), repeats the advice already given by preceding\r\nauthors, to which he annexes the highest importance, that is, the\r\nopening in time of abscesses of the gums and of the palate even before\r\nthey be completely matured, in order to prevent the suppurative process\r\nfrom extending and damaging the bone below. This author relates having\r\nseveral times arrested serious hemorrhage following on the extraction\r\nof teeth, by applying a little vitriol inside the alveolus, and, on\r\nthis, graduated compresses, which the patient pressed on the part with\r\nthe teeth of the opposite jaw.[403]\r\n\r\nJOHANN ADOLPH GÖRITZ, of Regensburg, in one of his writings published\r\nin 1725, disapproves the too frequent recurrence to extraction of the\r\nteeth, that is, carrying out the operation when it is not absolutely\r\nnecessary. He is also averse to the application of artificial teeth.\r\nIn support of his opinion he relates a case in which, a certain time\r\nafter the application of an artificial tooth, the natural ones to which\r\nit had been fixed became loose, so that it was necessary to proceed\r\nto the fixing of all three, that is, the artificial tooth and the two\r\nneighboring ones, to the firm teeth beyond them; these, however, became\r\nloosened in their turn, and it was at last necessary to extract six\r\nteeth. The great space thus created was filled with a prosthetic piece\r\nmade of hippopotamus tusk; but the author did not believe much good\r\nwould come of this either. In fact, he is of opinion that the natural\r\nteeth should be preserved by every possible means, and that, on the\r\nother hand, even in the case of a few being lost, it is better not to\r\nresort to substitutes. In the worst case, should the dental void cause\r\ntoo great inconvenience by damaging the pronunciation, or for some\r\nother reason, it may be filled by an “imitation” in soft wood.[404]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pierre Fauchard.]\r\n\r\nIf one takes into consideration the by no means slight inconvenience\r\nto which fixed artificial teeth gave rise, one cannot but admit\r\nthe aversion to them, expressed by Göritz and others, to have been\r\njustified.\r\n\r\nERNST FERDINAND GEBAUER, in 1726, made known a case in which, a tooth\r\nhaving been badly extracted by an incapable surgeon, the upper jaw was\r\nso seriously injured that a diffusive carious process ensued, which\r\nafter many years’ suffering brought the patient to the grave.[405]\r\n\r\nJOHANN BERNHARDT FISCHER (1685 to 1772), a very famous doctor, born\r\nin Lübeck, who had the honor of becoming archiater of the Russian\r\nEmpire, related, in 1726, a case of replantation, similar to those by\r\nPomaret and Carmeline; but HEINRICH BASS (1690 to 1754), of Bremen,\r\nprofessor of anatomy and surgery in Halle, endeavored to demonstrate\r\nthat in these cases the tooth did not really take root, but was rather\r\nmaintained in position by the contracting of the surrounding gum. One\r\nperceives from this that there were still, at that time, discordant\r\nopinions on the subject of replantation, and that this operation was\r\nfar from occupying, in dental surgery, the accredited position it has\r\nacquired today.\r\n\r\nHeinrich Bass also combats the abuse of extracting teeth\r\ninconsiderately, without absolute necessity, and expresses the opinion\r\nthat this is especially blamable in the case of teeth of the upper\r\njaw, principally because the extraction of either the canine or of the\r\nfirst or second large upper molars might easily produce the opening\r\nof Highmore’s antrum, and thus give rise to regrettable accidents. He\r\nis not, however, averse, like Göritz, to the use of artificial teeth;\r\nindeed, he advises the application of whole dental sets, even in the\r\nupper jaw, so long as there be two natural teeth existing to fix the\r\nprosthetic piece to.[406]\r\n\r\nPIERRE FAUCHARD, the founder of modern scientific dentistry, was born\r\nin Brittany about the year 1690, and died at Paris in the year 1761.\r\nHis celebrated work, _Le Chirurgien Dentiste_, was already written in\r\nthe year 1723, but not published until 1728. It marks a new epoch in\r\nthe history of dental art. The most renowned physicians, surgeons, and\r\nanatomists of the time testified their admiration for Fauchard’s work,\r\nwhich was translated into German in 1733, and afterward went through\r\ntwo French editions in the years 1746 and 1786.[407] We have been able\r\nto obtain the second edition[408] of this most important treatise, and\r\nof this we now intend making use for accurately analyzing the work, as\r\nit is probably more complete than the first, whilst the third, having\r\nbeen published after the author’s death, is probably merely a reprint.\r\n\r\nThe work consists of two volumes in duodecimo, in all 863 pages. In\r\nthe beginning there is the portrait of the author and a long and\r\ninteresting preface. The portrait, which we here reproduce, has also\r\nits historical importance, and this for two reasons, the first of\r\nwhich being that in it Fauchard is revealed to us as a person of very\r\ndistinguished appearance, and this gives us an idea of the social\r\ncondition of the surgeon-dentists of his time; the second, because\r\nthere are annexed to the portrait the following Latin verses, by a\r\ncertain Moraine, in which, whilst eulogizing the writings of the author\r\nand his ability in the treatment of the teeth, and in restoring force\r\nand beauty to them, he counsels him “to despise the tooth of envy,” as\r\nit will certainly break against his merit.\r\n\r\n  Dum dextra et scriptis solamina dentibus affers\r\n  Illorum in tuto sunt decor atque salus.\r\n  Invidiæ spernas igitur, Faucharde, cruentos\r\n  Dentes; nam virtus frangere novit eos.\r\n\r\nThat Fauchard, in common with all men of rare merit, had to combat all\r\nhis life against envy, we are able to perceive from what we read at\r\nthe end of the second volume of his work. The author here says that\r\n“the rumor having been falsely set about that he has abandoned the\r\nprofession; which rumor cannot have been invented otherwise than by\r\nthose individuals who, sacrificing honor to interest, would attract to\r\nthemselves the persons who honor the author with their confidence; he\r\ntherefore finds it necessary to give warning that he still continues\r\nthe practice of his art in Paris, in the _Rue de la Comédie Française_,\r\ntogether with his brother-in-law and sole student, M. Duchemin.”\r\n\r\nMore than a century and a half has passed by since Fauchard was\r\nobliged to defend himself against lies invented and set about to his\r\ndamage by envious colleagues, but even at the present day, when,\r\ngiven the high grade that civilization has reached, and professional\r\ncompetition ought not to make use of other weapons than intelligence,\r\nstudy, and application, some do not hesitate to have recourse to means\r\nequally disloyal, ignoble, and shameless as those practised by some\r\ncontemptible dentists of the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHARLATAN ON HIS PUBLIC STAGE]\r\n\r\nThe preface of Fauchard’s book is especially important for the notices\r\ntherein contained regarding the author, as well as the conditions of\r\ndental art at that period. And first of all, we find in it the proof of\r\nwhat we have already said elsewhere, namely, that even before Fauchard,\r\nthere were not only tooth-pullers but also dentists properly so\r\ncalled. Indeed, Fauchard makes mention also of the examination that\r\naspirant dentists had to undergo as far back as the year 1700. It may\r\ninterest our readers if we here give in detail some extracts in which\r\nthe author speaks on these subjects:\r\n\r\n“Although surgery in general,” says Fauchard, “has been greatly\r\nperfected in these latter times; although important discoveries have\r\nbeen made in anatomy and in the modes of operating, and many learned\r\nand interesting observations have been published, nevertheless,\r\ndentists nowhere find in works on surgery sufficient aids to guide\r\nthem in all their operations.” These last words should be sufficient\r\nalone to prove that the dentists spoken of by Fauchard were not mere\r\ntooth-pullers.\r\n\r\n“The authors who have written on anatomy, on surgical diseases and\r\noperations, have only treated very superficially the part relating\r\nto maladies of the mouth and teeth. If some writers have spoken in\r\nparticular about the teeth and their diseases, as, for instance, Urbain\r\nHemard and B. Martin, they have not done so in a sufficiently ample\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\n“Besides, there does not exist any public or private course of surgery\r\nin which the theory of dental maladies is amply taught and in which one\r\ncan receive fundamental instruction in this art, so necessary for the\r\nhealing of these maladies and of those of the neighboring parts.\r\n\r\n“This branch of the art having been but little cultivated, if not\r\nwholly abandoned by the most celebrated surgeons, their negligence has\r\ncaused it to fall into the hands of persons without theory and without\r\nexperience, who practise it in a haphazard fashion, guided neither by\r\nprinciples nor method. In Paris, it is only since 1700 that people’s\r\neyes have become opened to this abuse.\r\n\r\n“In this town, those who intend to become dentists are now obliged to\r\nundergo an examination, but although the examiners be most learned\r\nand well versed in all the other parts of surgery, I think, if I may\r\nbe allowed to express my opinion, that as they do not ordinarily\r\nthemselves practise dental surgery, it would not be amiss on these\r\noccasions to admit an able and experienced dentist, who might sound\r\nthe aspirant as to the difficulties which have come before him in the\r\ncourse of the long practice of his art, and who could communicate to\r\nthem the means of surmounting them. In this way one would not have\r\nto acknowledge that the attainment of the greater part of dental\r\nexperts[409] is below mediocrity.\r\n\r\n“To supply this want of instruction it would have been of great use\r\nif some able dentist, for example the late _Monsieur Carmeline_, who,\r\nin his day, practised with general applause, had made us acquainted\r\nwith his mode of operating and with the knowledge acquired through the\r\nsuccessful treatment of a great number of important cases.\r\n\r\n“What this celebrated surgeon-dentist has not done, I today dare to\r\nundertake. I shall at least afford an example of what he might have\r\ndone with greater erudition and better success.\r\n\r\n“From my youth I was destined to the surgical profession; the other\r\narts I have practised[410] have never made me lose sight of it. I was\r\nthe disciple of Alexandre Poteleret, surgeon-in-chief to His Majesty’s\r\nships, who had great experience in diseases of the mouth. To him I owe\r\nthe first rudiments of the knowledge I have acquired in the surgical\r\nspeciality I practise, and the progress I made under this able man gave\r\nme the emulation that has led me to further important discoveries. I\r\nhave collected among different writers what seemed to me most reliable.\r\nI have frequently discussed these matters with the ablest surgeons and\r\ndoctors of my acquaintance, and have neglected nothing in order to\r\nprofit by their counsels and by their ideas.\r\n\r\n“The experience which I have acquired during an uninterrupted practice\r\nof more than forty years has led me insensibly to the acquirement\r\nof further knowledge and to the modification of what seemed to me\r\ndefective in my earlier ideas. I offer to the public the results of my\r\nlabors and of my studies, hoping that they may be of some use to those\r\nwho wish to exercise the profession of surgeon-dentist.”\r\n\r\nThe reason why dentists before the time of Fauchard published hardly\r\nanything concerning their art, was perhaps out of a sentiment of\r\njealousy, which rendered them (that is, the best of the profession and\r\ntherefore the ones most capable of writing) but little disposed to make\r\nknown to others the results of their studies and of their experience,\r\nlest the fruits of their long labors should be utilized by others\r\nand they themselves be materially damaged by competition. That this\r\nsentiment of jealous egotism really existed in many dentists may be, in\r\na certain manner, deduced from a few words of Fauchard himself, who,\r\nalthough he has the very great merit of breaking with mean, old-world\r\nprejudices, nevertheless expresses the prevalent idea of the time,\r\nconsisting in the belief that every artificer, every inventor, had\r\nnot only the right, but also the duty of surrounding his discoveries\r\nwith secrecy and mystery. These are the words in which, making known\r\na certain improvement in dental prosthesis invented by him, he at\r\nthe same time expressed his conviction that by so doing he is acting\r\nagainst his own interests:\r\n\r\n“I have perfected and also invented several artificial pieces both for\r\nsubstituting a part of the teeth and for remedying their entire loss,\r\nand these pieces substitute them so well that they serve perfectly\r\nfor the same uses as the natural teeth. To the prejudice of my own\r\ninterests I now give the most exact description possible of them.”\r\n\r\nNow, although a man of elevated mind, such as Fauchard, may have been\r\ncapable of sacrificing his material interests to higher aims, it\r\nis not, however, to be wondered at, taking also into consideration\r\nthe lesser degree of culture and of professional ability of his\r\npredecessors, that none among them should have been found sufficiently\r\ndisinterested to publish the results of their particular studies and\r\nexperience, besides all those technical details which according to the\r\nideas of that time constituted the secrets of the profession.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this history, we have seen that the dental art\r\nwas practised from the most remote times and in the most various\r\ncountries, remaining, notwithstanding, for centuries in an embryonal\r\ncondition. It was toward the end of the seventeenth and the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century that, in the midst of the highly advanced\r\ncivilization of the great French capital, it attained a high degree\r\nof development, entitling it to be considered a special branch of the\r\nmedical art.\r\n\r\nIt would, therefore, be wrong to believe that the dental art was\r\ncreated, for the most part, by Fauchard, and one clearly perceives,\r\nfrom the perusal of his work, that although he made most important\r\ncontributions to this specialty, which he cultivated with passion,\r\nnevertheless, the greater part of the things therein treated of were\r\nalready known before his time, although no reference to them is to\r\nbe found in previous works; and this for the reasons we have already\r\nsuggested. The highest merit of Fauchard consists, still more than in\r\nhis inventions and improvements, in his having most ably collected\r\nand incorporated in a single work the whole doctrine of dental art,\r\ntheoretical as well as practical, thus setting in full light the\r\nimportance of the specialty, and giving it a solid scientific basis.\r\n\r\nFrance is therefore the first country where modern dentistry reached a\r\nhigh degree of development and also the first country where, earlier\r\nthan elsewhere, that is, about 1700, the dentists began to form a\r\nwell-defined class, to belong to which it was necessary to pass a\r\nspecial examination. This examination, as we learn from Fauchard, was\r\nheld before a commission of which no dentist formed a part, and exactly\r\nfor this reason gave but negative results and responded but little\r\nto its intended aim. The greater number of those who were authorized\r\nto practise dentistry after undergoing this examination showed a\r\nprofessional ability below mediocrity. Nevertheless, although few in\r\nnumber, good and able dentists were in no way wanting, as clearly\r\nappears from the preface to Fauchard’s work, and better still from\r\nthe following paragraph,[411] wherein the author speaks of the great\r\nperfection reached by dental surgery in Paris:\r\n\r\n“The teeth and the other parts of the mouth being subject, as we\r\nhave seen in the course of this work, to so many important diseases,\r\nrequiring the aid of the most able dentists, it is strange that the\r\nsovereigns of foreign countries, the heads of republics, and also the\r\nadministrators of our own provinces do not provide for the expense of\r\nsending young surgeons to Paris, to be instructed in a part of surgery\r\nso essential, and, notwithstanding, so ignored and neglected everywhere\r\nexcepting in this great city, where it has reached its highest\r\nperfection, both as regards the embellishment of the mouth and the cure\r\nof diseases, often of a most serious nature. These scholars would,\r\nthereafter, form others and would render great services to their nation\r\nand to their fellow citizens.”\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter of his work, Fauchard speaks “of the structure,\r\nposition, and connection of the teeth; of their origin and of their\r\ngrowth.” He distinguishes in each tooth a body, a root, and a neck,\r\nmaking the remark, however, that this last is to be considered as\r\nforming part of the body. According to the author, the name of “crown”\r\ncan only be applied suitably to the body of the molar teeth, but not\r\nto that of the incisors or of the canines, which has no resemblance\r\nwith a crown. Although in the adult the number of the teeth is\r\nnormally thirty-two, it may be that some persons have, nevertheless,\r\nthirty-one, thirty, twenty-nine, or even only twenty-eight teeth, and\r\nthis independently of any eventual loss, but for the simple reason that\r\nthe wisdom teeth are often cut very late in life (even after fifty\r\nyears of age), or do not all come forth, or sometimes are never cut at\r\nall. The author refers to some cases of a supernumerary tooth situated\r\nin general between the two superior central incisors and similar in\r\nform to the lateral incisors. He also observed two individuals who\r\nhad each thirty-four teeth, sixteen in the lower and eighteen in the\r\nupper jaw, and in these cases the two supernumeraries were situated\r\nbehind the incisors. Fauchard declares the popular opinion expressed\r\nalso by some ancient authors, of the milk teeth having no roots, to\r\nbe false. The roots of these teeth, he says, are gradually worn away\r\nbefore the latter are shed, when the permanent teeth are just on the\r\npoint of coming through; however, if it so happens that one or more of\r\nthe milk teeth be extracted some time before the period in which they\r\nare usually shed, their roots are found to be as long and as strong in\r\nproportion to the body as those of the permanent teeth. In children one\r\nfinds, besides the twenty deciduous teeth, the germs of the thirty-two\r\npermanent ones, for which reason it may be said that children have in\r\nall thirty-two teeth without counting the germs that may sometimes be\r\nfound at the extremities of the roots of the large molars. As, however,\r\nthe existence of such germs is an exceptional fact, the twelve large\r\nmolars, if extracted, are not ordinarily regenerated. This may be\r\npossible, however, if the germs in question exist, and, indeed, the\r\nauthor observed two persons in both of whom a large molar had been\r\nregenerated in the place of the one which had to be extracted.\r\n\r\nFauchard gives an excellent description of the alveoli and of the\r\nroots of the teeth; he alludes to the varieties which these latter\r\nmay present, and to the importance of the same from the point of view\r\nof extraction. Thus, speaking of the molars, he says: “Their roots\r\nsometimes touch one another at the points, whilst at the base, close\r\nto the body of the tooth, they are far apart. These are the so-called\r\n_dents barrées_ (barred teeth), which it is so difficult to extract,\r\nit being unavoidable to bring away together with the tooth the spongy\r\nosseous part occupying the interval between the roots.”\r\n\r\nIn this same chapter the author calls our attention to some anomalies\r\nworthy of note. He says that he has observed teeth that seemed to him\r\nto be derived from the union of two or three germs. He also relates\r\nthat a colleague of his showed him a tooth that appeared to be formed\r\nby the union of two, between the roots of which was a third tooth whose\r\ncrown was united to the vault formed by the roots of the first two.\r\n\r\nFauchard describes exactly the pulp cavity and the root canals, and\r\nspeaks of their gradual restriction, ending in an almost entire\r\ndisappearance in old age.[412] He treats of the nerves, of the\r\narteries, and of the veins of the teeth in a most detailed manner;\r\nthen, after alluding to their general structure, he goes on to speak\r\nof the microscopic constitution of the enamel, following in this the\r\ndescription given of it in 1699 by the academician La Hire.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the development of the teeth, Fauchard repeats what Urbain\r\nHémard had previously written. He apparently ignores the researches\r\nof the Italian anatomists, from whom, and especially from Eustachius,\r\nUrbain Hémard had literally reproduced all that concerns odontogeny.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter Fauchard speaks “of the maladies of children at\r\nthe period of teething and of the remedies best adapted thereto.” Among\r\nother means of treatment, he advises the incision of the gum when this\r\nis red, swollen, and distended and the tooth below it can be felt. For\r\nthe incisors and canines a simple incision ought to be made in the same\r\ncurve as the dental arch; for the molars a crosswise incision should\r\nbe made directly down to the tooth below, taking care not to leave\r\nany strips of uncut gingival tissue, lest these, being distended by\r\nthe emerging tooth, should continue to be the cause of pain and other\r\nmorbid phenomena.\r\n\r\nAlthough Fauchard does not tell us anything substantially new about\r\nteething maladies and their treatment, he nevertheless treats this\r\nsubject with much practical good sense, and does not merely make\r\nservile repetition of what preceding authors have written about it.\r\n\r\nIn the three following chapters the author speaks of the utility of the\r\nteeth, of the rules to be observed for their preservation, of the modes\r\nof keeping them white, and of strengthening the gums.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in the fifth chapter we learn that tooth brushes were\r\nthen already in use. Fauchard, however, advises the use of small\r\nsponges in their stead. He says: “Those who use brushes of horsehair,\r\nor pieces of cloth or of linen for cleaning the teeth, do not reflect\r\nthat all these materials are too rough, and that the practice of using\r\nthem frequently and without discretion often exercises a destructive\r\naction upon the teeth.[413] Not without good reason, I advise the\r\nabandonment of this usage, it being preferable, after having had the\r\nteeth cleaned by the dentist, to wash the mouth every morning with\r\ntepid water, and to rub the teeth up and down, inside and outside, with\r\na small, very fine sponge wetted in water; and it is still better to\r\nadd to this water a fourth part of aqua vitæ the better to fortify the\r\ngums and render the teeth firm.”\r\n\r\nInstead of a small sponge, says Fauchard, the end of a root of\r\nmarshmallow or lucern, which has first been subjected to a special\r\npreparation, may be used with benefit for rubbing the teeth. The author\r\ngives a long and minute description of this preparation, which we,\r\nhowever, omit, because devoid of historical interest.\r\n\r\nAs, however, the above means are not always sufficient for preserving\r\nthe teeth and gums in good condition, it is necessary in many cases,\r\nsays Fauchard, to make use of some paste, powder, or mouth wash. The\r\nauthor mentions a great number of compositions of this kind, giving\r\nthe formula for each one—almost always most complicated—and indicating\r\nthe peculiar advantages of each of them. We will here quote one of the\r\nformulæ as an example.\r\n\r\n“_A spirituous water, desiccative, balsamic, antiscorbutic, efficacious\r\nagainst many maladies of the mouth_:\r\n\r\n“℞—good sarsaparilla, four ounces; aristolochia rotunda, dried rinds\r\nof bitter organes, of lemons, and pomegranates, _ana_ three ounces;\r\npyrethrum, two ounces; cloves, one ounce; mustard seeds, one ounce;\r\nwild rocket seeds, two ounces. Pound well in a mortar and put the whole\r\ninto a retort with a long neck. Add thereto half a pound of pulverized\r\ncandied sugar and the same quantity of clarified rose honey. Pour in\r\nthree pints of good spirit of wine. Cork the retort well and leave all\r\nto digest in a cool place for five or six days. Then heat the retort\r\nforty-eight hours in the water bath over a slow fire, without letting\r\nthe liquid come to the boil. Afterward, when cold, decant in a glass\r\nbottle, to be kept well corked. Pour another three pints of spirit of\r\nwine on the residue of the drugs; cork the retort again, replacing it\r\nin the water bath for forty-eight hours, and regulating the fire as\r\nabove. Then, after letting it cool, pour off the liquid into the same\r\nbottle. Next remove all the residue from the retort, place it in a\r\nthick, white linen cloth, and force the remaining liquid through it,\r\nand add to that in the bottle. Put back half of the entire quantity of\r\nliquid in the same retort, and add thereto aloetic elixir and _baume du\r\ncommandeur_, _ana_ four ounces; pulverized dragon’s blood, three ounces\r\nand a half; pulverized gum of guaiac and Peruvian balsam, _ana_ three\r\nounces; gum lac, two ounces. Cork the retort again and replace it in\r\nthe water bath for forty-eight hours, as above. Let cool, decant the\r\nliquid in another glass bottle, and cork well. Pour the remaining half\r\nof the first liquid upon the rest of the drugs, replace the retort in\r\nthe water bath for forty-eight hours, let cool, and pour the contents\r\nin the last bottle. Filter the liquid well, and pour it into a bottle\r\nof sufficient size to be able to add the following liquids: aqua\r\nvulneraria and first cinnamon water, _ana_ three pints; second cinnamon\r\nwater, three half-pints; spirit of cochlearia, four pints. Shake the\r\nbottle well, filter again, and store in well-corked bottles.”\r\n\r\nThe author adds that the doses of the different drugs may be reduced\r\nin proportion to the quantity of liquor to be prepared; and that he\r\nprepares so large a quantity at a time because of the great sale he has\r\nfor it among his clients.\r\n\r\nThe preparation in question is counselled by the author as a remedy\r\nagainst pathological conditions, and of the gums especially. One makes\r\nuse of it in the following manner: Pour from seven to eight drops\r\ninto a wineglass of water; wet the tip of the finger and rub the gums\r\nand the teeth well. Or mix seven or eight drops in a good spoonful of\r\nwater, using a fine sponge to rub the teeth and gums.\r\n\r\nThe example we have cited suffices to show how much care one took at\r\nthat time in the preparation of substances destined to be used in the\r\npreservation of the teeth, and demonstrates at the same time that\r\nFauchard, inventor of that and many other preparations, besides being\r\nan able surgeon-dentist, was also exceedingly well versed in dental\r\nmateria medica.\r\n\r\nChapter VII treats of the general causes of dental, alveolar, and\r\ngingival diseases, and contains the complete enumeration of these\r\nmaladies. The causes of dental affections may be of two orders, viz.,\r\ninternal (general diseases, dyscrasic conditions) and external (the\r\naction of heat and cold, mechanical causes, etc.).\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken in particular of various causes, Fauchard adds:\r\n“Little or no care as to the cleanliness of the teeth is ordinarily the\r\ncause of all the maladies that destroy them.”\r\n\r\nThe author divides maladies of the dental apparatus into three classes,\r\nthat is:\r\n\r\n1. Maladies deriving from external causes and acting, therefore,\r\nespecially on the crown or uncovered part of the tooth.\r\n\r\n2. Maladies of the hidden parts of the tooth, that is, of the neck and\r\nroot.\r\n\r\n3. Symptomatic maladies, deriving from the teeth.\r\n\r\nIn the first class the author includes 45 pathological states, 17\r\nin the second and 41 in the third, making up a total of 103 morbid\r\nconditions. This should be sufficient to give us an idea of the\r\naccuracy with which Fauchard studied the maladies of the dental\r\napparatus, especially if one considers that preceding authors\r\nhad reduced these maladies to a very small number. Fauchard’s\r\nclassification is very complete, for notwithstanding the progress\r\nmade in succeeding years in this science, the pathological conditions\r\nnot to be found comprised in it are exceedingly few. Naturally,\r\nthe 103 diseases enumerated by Fauchard do not represent as many\r\ndistinct morbid entities. The author, in classifying dental maladies,\r\nkeeps especially in view the requirements of the practitioner, and\r\ntherefore makes numerous distinctions in each morbid process. Thus,\r\nhe distinguishes a great many varieties of caries, viz., the soft and\r\nputrid caries, the dry caries, the caries in part dry and in part soft,\r\nthe caries complicated by fracture, the superficial caries, the deeper\r\nand the deepest, the caries of the different surfaces of the crown, and\r\nso on. Also in the classification of other morbid processes, Fauchard\r\nmakes multifarious distinctions.\r\n\r\nThe passage referring to worms in the teeth deserves to be here\r\nreproduced:[414]\r\n\r\n“Sometimes worms are to be found in the carious cavities of the teeth,\r\nor in the deposit of tartar that covers them, and to these the name\r\nof dental worms has been given. Observations recorded by illustrious\r\nauthors are extant which attest this. Not having ever seen these worms,\r\nI neither admit nor deny their existence. Nevertheless, I conceive the\r\nthing nor to be physically impossible, although at the same time I do\r\nnot believe at all that these worms destroy the teeth or cause them to\r\ndecay, but rather that the eggs of some insect having been introduced\r\ninto the carious cavity of the tooth, either through alimentary\r\nsubstances or through the saliva, these eggs thus deposited have\r\ndeveloped and produced the worms alluded to. However this may be, as\r\nthey are not the real cause of the caries, their eventual presence does\r\nnot require any particular consideration.” Fauchard again recurs to the\r\nsubject of worms in Chapter VIII, in speaking of the particular causes\r\nof caries.[415]\r\n\r\n“It was, and is still, believed by the vulgar and also by some writers\r\nthat all toothache is caused by worms, which little by little destroy\r\nthe tissue of the osseous fibers and the nervous threads. If this were\r\nso, the explanation of pains and of decay in the teeth would be very\r\nsimple. This opinion is founded on pretended experiences relating\r\nto these insects, which may, it is said, be made to fall out of the\r\nteeth by the smoke of henbane seeds; this, however, has been declared\r\nfabulous by Andry, dean of the medical faculty of Paris, as well as\r\nother similar facts which he exposes in his book on the generation of\r\nworms.[416]\r\n\r\n“Andry relates, however, that with the help of the microscope one may\r\nsucceed in seeing certain worms that form beneath the deposit collected\r\nupon the teeth as the effect of want of cleanliness; these worms, he\r\nsays, are exceedingly small and characterized by a small round head\r\nwith a small black spot; the body is long and fine, pretty nearly like\r\nthe worms seen in vinegar through the microscope. He adds that these\r\nworms destroy the teeth little by little, causing a bad odor, but\r\nnot much pain. He believes it an error of the imagination to ascribe\r\nviolent pains in the teeth to dental worms, and holds that these only\r\nproduce a very slight, dull pain accompanied by itching.\r\n\r\n“I have done everything possible,” continues Fauchard, “to convince\r\nmyself with my own eyes of the existence of these worms. I have made\r\nuse of the excellent microscopes of Manteville, sworn surgeon of Paris,\r\nand have made a great number of experiments with them both on caries\r\nin teeth newly extracted as well as on tartar of different consistency\r\naccumulated on the same, but have never succeeded in discovering any\r\nworms. I am also still less disposed to believe in the existence of\r\nthese animals, because Hémard declares that he has never been able\r\nto find any worms in carious cavities. I am thoroughly convinced\r\nof Andry’s sincerity; neither do I doubt the truth of the facts he\r\nrelates; but it is easy to perceive from his own words how little the\r\npretended healers of teeth and their specifics for killing worms are to\r\nbe held in account; from the moment that, according to this writer, the\r\npains for which one is most obliged to have recourse to remedies are\r\nalmost always those not proceeding from the cause in question.”\r\n\r\nIn short, Fauchard does not believe at all that dental caries is\r\noccasioned by worms; and only from respect for the authority of Andry\r\nand other writers does he admit the accidental existence of these\r\nlittle animals in the carious cavities or upon the teeth, refusing,\r\nhowever, to attribute any importance to the same as regards the\r\netiology of caries.\r\n\r\nThis disease, says Fauchard,[417] is produced by a humor that\r\ninsinuates itself into the midst of the osseous fibers of the teeth,\r\nand displacing the particles which compose these fibers, gives rise to\r\ntheir destruction. The causes from which these disorders derive may be\r\nexternal or internal. The external causes are blows, violent efforts\r\nmade by the teeth; the improper use of the file, the application of\r\nacids or of other substances that injure the enamel, alteration of\r\nthe saliva, impressions of heat or cold, and also certain kinds of\r\nnourishment. Blows or violent efforts may produce caries, according to\r\nthe writer, by occasioning the effusion of the liquid contained in the\r\nvessels. The author gives analogous explanations for the other external\r\ncauses. As to the internal causes, they consist, he says, in alteration\r\nof the blood and of the humors.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, says Fauchard, are more subject to caries than all the rest\r\nof the bones in the human body, because, their tissues being denser,\r\nthe vessels are on this account closer together and more easily liable\r\nto be obstructed, choked up, and broken. Besides, the position of the\r\nteeth exposes them more than the other bones to the immediate action\r\nof external causes capable of producing the disorders alluded to; and\r\nfinally, what demonstrates the dental caries to be produced, for the\r\nmost part, by external causes, is that false teeth, either human or\r\nformed from those of animals, sometimes become carious just in the same\r\nway as the natural ones; which evidently happens by the sole action of\r\nexternal causes.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that the ideas expressed by Fauchard on the pathogeny\r\nof caries, cannot hold good against criticism. Nevertheless, we owe a\r\ngreat deal to this author for having once for all put an end to the\r\nridiculous theory of dental worms, and for having tried to find a\r\nreasonable explanation of the manner in which caries is produced.\r\n\r\nThe teeth, says Fauchard, have not all the same disposition toward this\r\nmorbid process; indeed, notable differences are to be observed in this\r\nrespect. The molars are, in fact, more apt to become decayed than the\r\nincisors or the canines; and the upper incisors and canines are more\r\nsubject to this disease than the inferior ones, because, by reason of\r\ntheir position, they are more frequently uncovered and more exposed to\r\nheat and cold, whether in eating and drinking or whether in the mere\r\naspiration or expiration of the air. It is to be observed, besides,\r\nthat when the eruption of the last molars is considerably delayed they\r\neasily decay.[418]\r\n\r\nHaving very frequently observed the symmetrical decay of corresponding\r\nteeth on both sides of the same jaw, Fauchard considers that these\r\ncases are not simply accidental, but rather holds that the fact\r\ndepends on a special cause, which, however, is not easy to determine.\r\nHe offers, at any rate, a sufficiently good explanation when he says\r\nthat as certain morbid causes (bad humors, etc.) must affect both\r\nsides of the mouth identically, it is but natural that the effects of\r\nsuch causes should be altogether analogous on the right and on the\r\nleft, and manifest themselves symmetrically on teeth having the same\r\nconfiguration, the same structure, and the same consistence.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the treatment of caries,[419] Fauchard alludes to\r\nthe fallaciousness of the many remedies against toothache which were\r\nlargely sold at his time by charlatans and impostors of every kind.\r\n\r\n“Some pretend to cure toothache with an elixir or some special essence;\r\nothers with plasters; others by means of prayers and signing with the\r\ncross; others with specifics for killing the worms that are supposed\r\nto gnaw the tooth and so cause pain; others pretend to be so clever\r\nthat they can cure the most inveterate toothache by merely touching the\r\ntooth with a finger dipped into or washed with some rare and mysterious\r\nliquid; others finally promise to cure every kind of toothache by\r\nscarifying the ears with the lancet or cauterizing them with a red-hot\r\niron.”\r\n\r\n“I am well aware,” adds Fauchard, “that it can be alleged in favor\r\nof this last prejudice that the celebrated Italian doctor Valsalva\r\nindicates with great precision the point in which the actual cautery\r\nis to be applied to the ear, in order to calm toothache. He also\r\ndetermines the size of the iron and the manner of applying it. The\r\nauthority of so celebrated an author, whose opinion is certainly worthy\r\nof respect, should induce me to believe that there may perhaps be\r\nsome cases in which it is possible to use this remedy with success;\r\nnevertheless, I cannot persuade myself that such treatment can be\r\nuseful in common cases of toothache.\r\n\r\n“At Nantes, a city of Brittany, I knew a Turk, a watchmaker by\r\nprofession, who was renowned for this mode of curing toothache. But I\r\nalso know that, in spite of the pretended cures, the greater number\r\nof those who put themselves into his hands were obliged finally to\r\nhave recourse to me, in order to find relief for their sufferings. I\r\nafterward saw several other persons use the same remedy with no better\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“There are, besides, an infinity of other remedies vaunted as\r\nefficacious against toothache, but the greater number of them are so\r\nridiculous and extravagant that it would be both tiresome and useless\r\nto speak of them. We will, nevertheless, give one more mentioned by M.\r\nde Brantôme.”[420]\r\n\r\nThe author here quotes a passage of this writer, wherein he says that,\r\nhaving been suffering from toothache for two days, the apothecary of\r\nElizabeth of France, wife of Philip II of Spain, brought him a most\r\nsingular herb, which when held in the hollow of the hand had the virtue\r\nof making the pain cease immediately; and in this way he was, in fact,\r\neffectually cured.\r\n\r\nAnd here Fauchard expresses himself of the same opinion as Urbain\r\nHémard, who believes the cure of toothache by means of words, or by\r\nthe touch of paper on which certain signs are written, or remedies\r\nheld in the hand, etc., to be merely the effect of the force of the\r\nimagination, and he opines that the patient, having a vivid belief in\r\nthe mysterious thing proposed to him remains under the impression of\r\nan inward commotion, by the effect of which it may well be that the\r\nmorbid humor is deviated from the painful part to other parts of the\r\nbody. The effects of the various passions on the bodily functions are,\r\nsays Fauchard, very well known. Thus, when under the influence of anger\r\nthe wounded at times do not feel any pain, and those who suffering from\r\na tormenting toothache go to a dentist to have the tooth drawn are\r\nsometimes seized by such great fear as not to feel the pain any longer,\r\nand go away, only to return later on renewal of their sufferings;\r\nalthough there have been cases where the pain ceased altogether.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this explanation, of which we will not here discuss the\r\nvalue, allowing it, however, as satisfactory enough, Fauchard continues\r\nby making a most curious consideration, which as it is of a somewhat\r\nsurprising effect in a scientific work, we will not deprive our readers\r\nof it. He believes it to be his duty to give the following warning,\r\nnamely, that “the modes of cure, by means of certain words, of certain\r\nsigns, laying on of hands, written charms, etc., savoring much of\r\nsuperstition and of diabolic artifice, are prohibited by the Church as\r\nsinning against the first Commandment, as much in him who practises\r\nthem as him who consents thereto.”\r\n\r\nAfter the above preliminaries, the author passes on to treat the\r\nimportant subject of the mode of curing caries.[421] According to him,\r\nwhen caries has not yet attacked the internal cavity of the tooth at\r\nall, or only in a very slight degree, there are four modes of curing\r\nit: the first consists in the use of files or scrapers, the second in\r\nthe application of lead, the third in the use of oil of cinnamon or\r\nof cloves, and the fourth in the application of the actual cautery.\r\nFauchard expresses most energetically his disapproval of the means\r\nof cure recommended by Dionis in cases of caries of the triturating\r\nsurfaces, which consisted in the cauterizing of the decayed spot\r\nwith a drop of oil of vitriol applied by means of a miniature paint\r\nbrush, declaring this to be both dangerous and hurtful because of the\r\ndestructive and corrosive action of the oil of vitriol and because of\r\nthe impossibility of limiting its action solely to the affected part of\r\nthe tooth.\r\n\r\nThe general method of cure followed by Fauchard is described by him in\r\nthese terms:\r\n\r\n“When a tooth is but slightly decayed, it is sufficient to remove the\r\ncaries with the instruments of which I will speak hereafter, and to\r\nfill the cavity with lead. If, however, the cavity be rather deeper\r\nand occasions pain, one should, after having scraped it, put a small\r\nball of cotton-wool soaked in oil of cinnamon or of cloves into the\r\nhollow of the caries every day. This medication must be continued for a\r\nsufficient time, taking care to squeeze in the cotton-wool by degrees\r\nto accustom the sensitive parts to the pressure. Four or five days\r\nlater one removes the material from the carious cavity. This treatment\r\nsometimes prevents a return of the pain; it produces on the osseous\r\nfibers of the tooth a slight but sufficient exfoliation and impedes\r\nthe progress of the caries. If the pain should not cease after having\r\ncontinued this method for a sufficient length of time, one should then\r\nhave recourse to the actual cautery and stop the tooth after a certain\r\ntime, if the form and situation of the decayed cavity permit it; for\r\none sometimes meets with cavities that are not able to maintain the\r\nstopping.\r\n\r\n“If the caries penetrates as far as the cavity of the tooth, it may\r\ngive rise to an abscess; and this I have often observed in persons to\r\nwhom the caries of the incisors or of the canines occasioned great\r\npain. In such cases I introduce the extremity of the sound into the\r\ncavity of the tooth in order to facilitate the evacuation of matter.\r\nAs soon as the pus is evacuated the pain ceases. I then leave these\r\npatients in repose for two or three months; after this time, I stop the\r\ndecayed tooth or teeth to avoid their getting worse.”\r\n\r\nAs anyone may perceive, the methods used by Fauchard against caries\r\nleft much to be desired, when compared with those now in use. With such\r\nimperfect methods it is but natural that one did not always succeed in\r\nobtaining the immediate cessation of the pain resulting from caries.\r\nThe want of additional remedies was, therefore, felt; and, in fact,\r\nFauchard tells us[422] of two with which he had experimented and found\r\nmost efficacious against toothache. The first is a resinous plaster\r\nto be applied to the temples; the other is a paste to be applied, in\r\nquantity equal to the size of a small bean, between the gums and the\r\ncheek, and which was composed of various ingredients, among others,\r\npyrethrum, black pepper, ginger, stavesacre, mace, cloves, cinnamon,\r\nsea salt, and vinegar. After having given the mode of preparation and\r\napplication of the two above-mentioned remedies, Fauchard adds: “These\r\nremedies prove especially efficacious if one takes care to introduce a\r\nlittle cotton-wool or lint into the decayed cavity, soaked in oil of\r\ncloves, or cinnamon, mixed with an equal quantity of extract of opium,\r\nand if one resorts opportunely to bleeding and purging; which ought\r\nnever to be neglected in the case of plethoric persons.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the author speaks of another remedy,[423] and one which we\r\nnever should have expected to find in his book; but he assures us that\r\nby it many persons who had almost all the teeth decayed and suffered\r\nvery often from toothache found great relief.\r\n\r\n“It consists in rinsing the mouth every morning and also in the evening\r\nbefore going to bed with a few spoonfuls of one’s own urine immediately\r\nafter it has been emitted, always provided the individual be not ill.\r\nOne is to hold it in the mouth for some time, and the practice ought to\r\nbe continued. This remedy is good but undoubtedly not pleasant, except\r\nin so far as that it procures great relief. Some of those to whom I\r\nhave recommended it, and who have used it, have assured me that in\r\nthis manner they were relieved of pain to which, up to then, they had\r\ncontinually been subject. It is rather difficult in the beginning to\r\naccustom one’s self to it; but what would one not do to secure one’s\r\nself health and repose.”\r\n\r\nIn order to explain the virtue of the urine as a remedy, the author\r\npauses to speak of its chemical composition, and then adds:\r\n\r\n“The rectified spirit of urine[424] could be substituted for the human\r\nurine. One should then take two drams of this substance and mix it with\r\ntwo or three ounces of aqua vitæ, or water of cresses or of cochlearia.\r\nSal volatile[425] has the same virtues. Those who wish to make use of\r\nit should dissolve fifteen to thirty grains of it in the same quantity\r\nof the above liquid.”\r\n\r\nFauchard then passes on to speak of trepanning of the teeth when they\r\nare worn away or decayed and cause pain.[426] He begins by saying that\r\nmost varieties of pain caused by the canines and the incisors when\r\nworn away or decayed cease after the use of the trepan. He, however,\r\nunderstands the term trepanning in a very wide sense, comprehending\r\ntherein the use of any instrument whatever (even a needle or a pin)\r\nwith which one penetrates into the inner cavity of the teeth.\r\n\r\nIn interstitial caries of the canines and incisors one ought, says\r\nFauchard, first to enlarge the interstice with a small file of a\r\nconvenient shape, then to scrape the decayed cavity, and finally to\r\nopen up the canal or inner cavity of the tooth with a perforator or\r\nwith a small trepan.\r\n\r\n“In this way the pus or other humors that may have collected in the\r\ntooth can easily find their way out, and the pain will cease at once or\r\nin a short time.”\r\n\r\nThe author describes with much minuteness the manner of trepanning, and\r\nthen adds:\r\n\r\n“After this operation one should let a few weeks pass without doing\r\nanything to the affected tooth, and afterward, in order to impede\r\nfurther decay, one must put a little cotton-wool into it soaked in oil\r\nof cinnamon or of cloves. The tooth must be left in this state for\r\nsome months, taking care to renew the cotton-wool. It is necessary to\r\nobserve that in beginning to put in the cotton-wool this should be done\r\nwith lightness and without pressing it down much, so that if pus should\r\ngather again it may be able to make its way through the cotton-wool,\r\nthe principal object of this being to hinder the penetrating of\r\nalimentary substances into the tooth, which would be the cause of\r\nfurther decay. If the cotton were pressed into the tooth from the\r\nbeginning, the pus, not being able to find an exit, would accumulate,\r\nand might cause much pain, if the nervous parts of the tooth were\r\nnot yet dried up or destroyed. The same thing might happen after the\r\napplication of a lead stopping, and one would be obliged to remove it\r\nand let considerable time pass before putting it in again.”\r\n\r\nFurther on the author says that while the trepanning of incisors or\r\ncanines almost always causes the pain to cease, by opening up an exit\r\nto the morbid matter retained within the cavity of such teeth, the\r\nsame is not the case with the molars, these having several roots and\r\nseveral cavities, of great variety, which lend themselves but little to\r\naccurate trepanning. “Hémard,” he adds, “judges it necessary to extract\r\nthese teeth, or at least to break off the crown (_les déchapeller_),\r\nin order to give exit to the corrupt matter that is closed up in the\r\ncavity; this sometimes causes the pain to cease. He (Hémard) says that\r\nhe has seen many abscesses in the interior of teeth, which were not\r\nexternally decayed, and that after having broken off the crown he found\r\nwithin the cavity a corrupt matter of an insupportable smell.”\r\n\r\nRelative to such cases, Fauchard says that, besides the teeth, also the\r\nsurrounding parts suffer and are imperilled by these conditions. “The\r\ngreater part of the violent fluxions deriving therefrom often terminate\r\nin abscesses and fistulæ of the gums and of the surrounding parts, and\r\nsometimes with considerable and dangerous decay of the bone, as I have\r\nrelated in some of my observations.”\r\n\r\nOne sees that Fauchard was clinically very well acquainted with the\r\ngrave forms of pulpitis and their possible consequences, although\r\nignoring the true nature of this process, which has only been studied\r\nand illustrated much more recently.\r\n\r\nChapter XL (page 177) treats of dental tartar, of its cause, of the\r\nharmful effects it produces, and of the prophylaxis and therapy\r\nrelating thereto. Three illustrations which are added to this chapter\r\nrepresent the different aspects of a mass of tartar of exceptional\r\nsize formed around the body of a lower molar. The surgeon Bassuel, a\r\nfriend of the author, had removed this mass of tartar, together with\r\nthe entire molar, from the jaw of an old woman. The mass itself was\r\nalmost the size of a hen’s egg, the superficies being very irregular;\r\nit rendered mastication altogether impossible and caused the cheek to\r\nstand out in such a way as to give the appearance of a tumor.[427]\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter[428] the author enumerates the various dental\r\noperations: “Cleaning the teeth, separating them, shortening them,\r\nremoving the caries, cauterizing, stopping, straightening crooked\r\nteeth, steadying loose teeth, trepanning, simple drawing of teeth,\r\nreplacing them in their own alveoli, or transplanting them to another\r\nmouth, and finally substituting artificial teeth for those wanting.” He\r\nthen adds: “All these operations require in him who carries them out\r\na light, secure, and skilful hand and a perfect theoretic knowledge,\r\nby which he may decide on the opportuneness of performing them, of\r\ndeferring them, or of abandoning them altogether. In fact, one may know\r\nperfectly well how to carry out an operation and nevertheless undertake\r\nit in a case in which it is not at all proper to operate. Into such\r\nan error no one can fall save through sheer ignorance of the cause of\r\nthe disease or of the right means of curing it. From this it must be\r\nconcluded that the knowledge required in order to be a good dentist is\r\nnot so limited as some imagine, and that the imprudence and the danger\r\nof placing one’s self in ignorant hands is as great as the temerity of\r\nthose who undertake to exercise so delicate a profession without the\r\nknowledge of even its first elements.”\r\n\r\nBefore speaking in detail of all the above operations, the author\r\ndedicates a lengthy chapter[429] to describing with the greatest\r\nminuteness the position to be given in general, as well as in special\r\ncases, to the head and body of the patient, and the manner in which\r\nthe dentist should place himself with regard to the former, so as to\r\nbe able to make a proper use of each of his hands. As a rule, Fauchard\r\nmade the patient seat himself in a convenient arm-chair; in exceptional\r\ncases he placed him on a sofa, or on a bed. He draws this subject to a\r\nclose with the following words:\r\n\r\n“It is, indeed, surprising that the greater part of those who practise\r\ntooth drawing should ordinarily seat the patient on the ground, this\r\nbeing both indecent and not very clean. This position is not only\r\nuncomfortable, but causes sometimes a sense of fear, especially in\r\npregnant women, to whom it may, besides, prove very harmful. But it is\r\nstill more surprising that certain authors should even nowadays affirm\r\nthis to be the most convenient position, while it is instead one to be\r\nentirely rejected.”\r\n\r\nIn speaking of extraction of the teeth,[430] Fauchard begins by saying\r\nthat the milk teeth, although destined to be shed, should never be\r\nextracted, except in cases of absolute necessity, as, for instance,\r\nwhen being decayed, they give rise to intolerable pain. The alveoli of\r\nthe infantile jaw are weak, whilst the roots of the deciduous teeth\r\nare sometimes firmer and more solid than one would believe, and hence\r\nit is that in extracting a milk tooth one runs the risk of injuring\r\nthe alveolus and even of carrying away a portion of it altogether with\r\nthe tooth, not to speak of the danger of damaging or even destroying\r\nthe germ of the permanent tooth lying below. Besides, Fauchard adds,\r\nthere are sometimes deciduous teeth that are never shed and never\r\nrenewed. One must, therefore, defer drawing children’s teeth as long as\r\npossible unless they are loose. When, however, intolerance of pain or a\r\ncaries endangering the integrity of the neighboring teeth oblige one to\r\nrecur without delay to extraction, one should carry out the operation\r\nwith prudence and judgment, so as to avoid the dangers alluded to. It\r\nsometimes happens, says Fauchard, that one finds in children a crooked\r\ntooth by the side of a straight one; in these cases ignorant\r\ntooth-drawers have often been known to remove the crooked (permanent)\r\ntooth, and to leave the straight, viz., the deciduous one, which\r\nafterward falls of itself, the individual thus remaining deprived of\r\none of his teeth for the rest of his life. The rule to be observed in\r\norder to avoid a similar error is always to extract the older of the\r\ntwo teeth and to leave the one that has been cut more recently, which\r\nis easily recognized by its being ordinarily firmer in the socket and\r\nof a better color than the first.\r\n\r\nAnd here the author inveighs against all the charlatans of his day who\r\ndared, without being dentists, to perform dental operations, and whose\r\nnumber, it would seem, was ever increasing, so much so that he is led\r\nto exclaim: “There will shortly be more dentists than persons affected\r\nwith dental diseases!” In proof of this he relates the case of a\r\ncutler of Paris, who extracted the molar tooth of a young girl because\r\nblack spots having appeared on it, he believed it to be decayed; but\r\nperceiving that he had only removed the crown (it was a deciduous\r\ntooth about to fall out), and thinking that he had broken the tooth,\r\nproceeded to extract the root, removing, in his gross ignorance, the\r\npermanent tooth on the point of coming through.\r\n\r\nReturning to the indications for the extraction of teeth, Fauchard\r\nsays that when a tooth planted irregularly in the mouth cannot be\r\nstraightened by any of those means to which he afterward alludes, and\r\noccasions damage or inconvenience or constitutes a deformity, the sole\r\nremedy is its removal. As to decayed teeth and the pain that they\r\nproduce, when the evil cannot be remedied with oil of cinnamon or oil\r\nof cloves, with the actual cautery, or by stopping, one must have\r\nrecourse to extraction, and this to satisfy four different indications,\r\nthat is, before all, to procure the cessation of violent pain; in the\r\nsecond place, to prevent the caries from being communicated to the\r\nneighboring teeth; thirdly, to remove the fetid smell deriving from\r\nthe substances that are retained within the carious cavity, and to\r\nimpede the teeth on the same side from becoming covered with tartar,\r\nas inevitably happens when by reason of painfulness in eating they are\r\nforced to be inactive; fourth and lastly, because the dental caries,\r\nnot infrequently gives rise to other diseases, which ordinarily cannot\r\nbe cured unless the cause from which it arises be recognized and\r\nsuppressed.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes,” continues Fauchard, “such violent and obstinate pain\r\narises in a tooth that we are obliged to extract it, although not\r\ndecayed nor presenting deformity.”\r\n\r\nThe author combats the old prejudice, that it is not right to draw\r\nteeth in cases of pregnant women or of nursing mothers, lest the\r\noperation should prove dangerous to the patient or to the fetus, or\r\nproduce alteration or arrest of the milk secretion. Only the fear\r\narising from this prejudice can, according to the author, cause any\r\nof the dreaded contingencies. The dentist ought, therefore, to seek\r\nto dissipate the fears of these patients, by persuading them of the\r\ninnocuous nature of the operation as well as of its short duration,\r\nand should represent to them, on the other hand (if the operation\r\nbe really necessary), the advantages of promptly deciding on it, to\r\navoid the harm and the peril that prolonged suffering and the tortures\r\nof sleeplessness might occasion to themselves as well as to the\r\nunborn child or to the suckling infant, such as abortion, premature\r\nconfinement, alteration of the milk, etc.\r\n\r\nAccording to Fauchard, “one should always take the precaution of hiding\r\nthe instruments from the patient’s sight, especially in the case of\r\nextracting a tooth, so as not to terrify him.”\r\n\r\nThe author then speaks of cases where it is necessary to open the jaws\r\nby force;[431] of the instruments to be used; of the mode of employing\r\nthem; of all the precautions to be observed under such circumstances;\r\nof the necessity that may eventually arise of sacrificing some one\r\ntooth when the enforced opening of the jaws has been impracticable; of\r\nthe advisability of sacrificing preferably in such cases one of the\r\npremolars in order to damage as little as possible the masticatory\r\nfunction and the appearance of the face; of the instruments best\r\nadapted for carrying out this operation; of the danger it presents and\r\nof the best mode of avoiding it; finally, of what it is necessary to do\r\nin given cases to keep the mouth open, in order to not be obliged to\r\nrepeat the operation a second time.\r\n\r\nThe six following chapters of the first volume treat very extensively\r\nof the anatomy and physiology of the gums,[432] of gingival diseases\r\nand their treatment.[433] The subject is treated in a masterly manner,\r\nalthough these chapters do not offer anything of original importance.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of Chapter XXII, in which the author speaks of\r\nscorbutic affections and of their treatment.\r\n\r\nThe chapters we have cited are accompanied by four plates, representing\r\nthirteen instruments for use in the treatment of the above diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78\r\n\r\nInstruments for opening the mouth in cases of lockjaw (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nThe author then speaks[434] of the accidents which may arise from\r\ncaries and from other dental diseases, not only in the parts nearest\r\nto the teeth, but also in localities more or less distant from them,\r\nfor example, fistulæ reaching as far as the cheek bone or the eye,\r\nnecrotic destruction of the maxillary bones, etc.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of Fauchard’s work finishes with a collection of\r\nmost interesting cases, which may be read even at the present day\r\nwith pleasure, and from which one may derive some useful information.\r\nThese cases are about eighty in number, spread over fifteen chapters,\r\naccording to the various nature of the cases themselves. This valuable\r\ncollection gives clear evidence of Fauchard’s eminence both as operator\r\nand observer, and affords at the same time an idea of the extent of his\r\npractice which enabled him to collect so considerable a number of cases\r\nof more than common interest.\r\n\r\nChapter XXV contains some observations on “_well-authenticated cases_”\r\nof regeneration of permanent teeth in individuals of ages varying from\r\nfifteen to seventy-five years. We will here give two of them by way of\r\ncuriosities:\r\n\r\n“In the year 1708 Mademoiselle Deshayes, now the wife of M. de Sève,\r\nresiding at Paris in rue de Baune, and who was then fourteen years of\r\nage, had the first large molar on the right side of the inferior jaw\r\nextracted by me, because decayed and causing pain. The following year\r\nshe returned to have her teeth cleaned by me, and whilst doing this I\r\nobserved that the tooth extracted had been wholly regenerated.”[435]\r\n\r\n“In the year 1720 the eldest son of M. Duchemin, player in ordinary\r\nto the King, who was then sixteen years old, came to me to have the\r\nsecond large molar on the left side of the lower jaw extracted. It was\r\nvery much decayed. I drew it, and a year and a half after the tooth was\r\ncompletely regenerated.”[436]\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXVIII the author relates twelve cases of dental\r\nirregularities corrected by him with satisfactory and at times even\r\nsurprising results. We here refer, in Fauchard’s own words, to the last\r\ntwo of these cases, not because of their being the most important, but\r\nbecause from them it is evident that Fauchard was not the only dentist\r\nwho undertook such corrections, although he was perhaps the only one\r\nwho, in certain cases, carried them out with a rapid method.\r\n\r\n“In the year 1719 M. l’abbé Morin, about twenty-two years of age,\r\nwhose countenance was greatly deformed from the bad arrangement of the\r\nincisors and canines, consulted various colleagues of mine as to the\r\npossibility of correcting the irregularity of his teeth. Some found the\r\nthing so difficult that they advised him to do nothing at all, that is,\r\nnot to risk any attempt. He came to me by chance one day whilst another\r\ndentist was with me. We both examined his mouth with much attention.\r\nNow, as this dentist was my elder, and I believed him to have more\r\nexperience than I had, I begged him to give me his opinion as to\r\nthe best method to follow in this case, in order to insure success.\r\nWhether it be that he would not give me advice, or that he was not in\r\na position to be able to do so, the fact is, that his answer was not\r\nsuch as I could have wished. I therefore felt myself obliged to tell\r\nhim that I hoped to put this gentleman’s teeth in order within three\r\nor four days. My colleague was not aware that this could be done so\r\nquickly; urged by curiosity, he returned when the time I had indicated\r\nhad elapsed, and found, not without surprise, M. Morin’s teeth reduced\r\nto perfect order.”[437]\r\n\r\n“Several years ago the wife of M. Gosset, Reviseur des Comptes, sent\r\nfor me to examine the teeth of her daughter, then twelve years of age.\r\nI found the lateral incisor on the left side of the lower jaw strongly\r\ninclined toward the palate in such a manner as to constitute a real\r\ndisfigurement. Interrogated by the mother as to the possibility of\r\nremedying this, I replied that it could easily be done in eight or ten\r\ndays, with the method of threads, if the young girl were only sent\r\nevery day to my house. As, however, the young lady received instruction\r\nfrom several masters who came to her house each day, my proposal was\r\nnot accepted, in order not to distract her from her studies. This\r\ninduced me to say to the mother that, if she were willing, I would put\r\nthe crooked tooth into its natural position in a few minutes. Surprised\r\nat so short a time being demanded for the operation, she consented\r\nto my performing it immediately. Making use of the file, I began by\r\nseparating the tooth from the neighboring ones which pressed upon it,\r\nslightly diminishing the space it ought to have occupied. This done,\r\nI straightened the tooth with the pelican, placing it in its natural\r\nposition, to the great astonishment of the young girl’s mother and of\r\nother persons present, who told me they had many times seen similar\r\ncorrections that had been carried out by the late M. Carmeline and\r\nothers, never, however, with this method or in so short a time. As soon\r\nas I had reduced the tooth to its normal position I fixed it to those\r\nnext to it by means of a piece of common thread, which I left there\r\neight days; and during that time I made the young girl rinse her mouth\r\nfour or five times a day with an astringent mouth wash. After the tooth\r\nhad become firm, it would not have been suspected that it had ever been\r\nout of its normal position.”[438]\r\n\r\nIn Chapter XXX the author gives an account of five cases of dental\r\nreplantation and one of transplantation. This last operation was\r\ncarried out on a captain who had the upper canines on the left side\r\ndecayed and aching; he inquired of the author if it were possible to\r\ndraw it and replace it by another person’s tooth. Having received an\r\naffirmative reply, the officer sent immediately for a soldier of his\r\ncompany to whom he had already spoken on the subject. This man’s\r\ncanine was found by Fauchard to be too large; nevertheless, for want\r\nof better he extracted and transplanted it, after having diminished it\r\nin length and in thickness. This it was not possible to do without the\r\ncavity of the tooth remaining open, and for this reason, when, after\r\nabout two weeks’ time it had become quite firm, he stopped it. But the\r\nstopping immediately caused such insupportable pain (which circumstance\r\nastonished the writer not a little) that he was obliged to take it out\r\nagain the following day, on which the pain ceased directly. Fauchard\r\nsaw this patient eight years afterward, and was assured by him that the\r\ntransplanted tooth had lasted him six years, but that its crown had\r\nbeen gradually destroyed by caries. The root had been extracted by a\r\ndentist, not without considerable pain.[439]\r\n\r\nWe now give one of his cases of replantation in the words of the author\r\nhimself:\r\n\r\n“On April 10, 1725, the eldest daughter of M. Tribuot, organ builder\r\nto His Majesty the King, called on me; she was tormented by violent\r\ntoothache caused by caries of the first small molar on the right side\r\nof the upper jaw; but although she was desirous of having the tooth\r\nremoved, to be freed of the pain, she, on the other hand, could not,\r\nwithout difficulty, make up her mind, thinking of the disfigurement\r\nwhich its loss would occasion, and thus it was that she was induced to\r\nask me if it would not be possible to put it back again after having\r\nextracted it, as I had already done in the case of her younger sister.\r\nI replied that this might very well be done, provided the tooth came\r\nout without being broken, without any splintering of the alveolus, or\r\ngreat laceration of the gum. The patient, upon this, completely made up\r\nher mind. I extracted the tooth very carefully so as not to break it,\r\nneither were the gum nor the alveolus injured in any way. I therefore\r\nwas induced to put the decayed tooth back in its alveolus, and having\r\ndone this, I took care to tie it to the neighboring teeth with a\r\ncommon thread, which I left in position for a few days. The tooth\r\nbecame perfectly firm, and only caused pain for two days after being\r\nreplanted.... To better preserve it, I stopped the carious cavity.”[440]\r\n\r\nNot without interest is a case of disease of Highmore’s antrum,\r\noriginating in the following way. A charlatan attempted to extract by\r\nmeans of a common key a canine tooth which had erupted in an abnormal\r\nposition. He applied the hollow of the key to the tooth and beat upon\r\nthe handle with a stone. But the tooth, instead of penetrating into the\r\nhollow of the key, was driven into the maxillary sinus.[441]\r\n\r\nTwo important cases of “stony excrescence” of the gums (probably\r\nosteomas) are to be found in Chapter XXXII. One of these tumors was\r\nremoved by the dentist Carmeline after the patient had been tortured\r\nwith useless operations by surgeons, who, not recognizing the true seat\r\nof the evil and mistaking it for a tumor in the cheek, had, over and\r\nabove all the rest, produced a permanent disfigurement of the patient’s\r\nface and a perforation of the cheek that he was obliged to keep closed\r\nfor the remainder of his life with a wax plug, to prevent the exit of\r\nthe saliva and of liquid or masticated aliments.[442]\r\n\r\nSeveral important observations on obstinate cases of cephalalgia,\r\nprosopalgia, otalgia, and other varieties of pain arising from dental\r\ncaries are to be found in Chapter XXXIII. In all these cases the\r\nremoval of the decayed tooth or teeth procured the prompt cessation of\r\npain. Among others worthy of note is a case of violent otalgia caused\r\nby the decay of a lower molar, which, however, was itself not painful.\r\nThis circumstance drew Fauchard himself into error, causing him to\r\nbelieve that the otalgia was independent of the decayed tooth; he\r\ntherefore merely stopped the tooth to prevent the caries from extending\r\nfarther. The pain in the ear continued, however, and the patient\r\ntherefore consulted a doctor of the Faculty of Paris, Coutier, who told\r\nher that the decayed tooth might be the cause of the earache, and that,\r\ntherefore, before undertaking any other cure, she ought to have it\r\nextracted. This advice was followed and the earache ceased promptly and\r\ncompletely.[443]\r\n\r\nIn another case a patient twenty-seven years of age was tormented by\r\nviolent pain in all her teeth on the left side, in the temple and the\r\near, as well as in the chin, the palate, and the throat. The doctors\r\nand surgeons consulted decided the cause to be rheumatism. The patient\r\nwas bled not less than four times and subjected to various other\r\nmethods of treatment (purgatives, clysters, poultices, etc.), but all\r\nin vain. She, however, perceiving that one of her teeth was decayed,\r\nhad it taken out. It was believed that the cause of the malady had thus\r\nbeen found and removed; but an hour later the pain began again with\r\nthe same violence as before, continuing for some months; after this\r\nit ceased of itself. On the return of the pain, later on, in all its\r\nformer intensity, the patient consulted the very able surgeon Petit,\r\nwho advised her to see Fauchard, as possibly the malady might have its\r\ncause and point of departure in some bad tooth. Fauchard found one of\r\nthe inferior molars decayed. This being extracted, the pain promptly\r\nceased, not to return any more.[444]\r\n\r\nChapter XXXV contains twelve cases of serious maladies arising from\r\ndental diseases. One of these cases was observed in a patient aged\r\nfifty-seven years, who in consequence of caries of the last inferior\r\nmolar on the right lost through necrosis a considerable portion of the\r\nlower jaw, including the whole of the right condyle; he was affected,\r\nbesides, with caries of the temporal bone, in so advanced a degree\r\nthat the probe could reach the dura mater; he was, therefore, in\r\nserious danger of his life, had to undergo several surgical operations\r\nof exceptional gravity, and even after recovery remained permanently\r\nsubject to various disturbances, such as a salivary fistula, paralysis\r\nof the lower eyelid, etc. And all this because the surgeons whom\r\nthe patient had called in had directed all their attention to the\r\nsecondary facts, instead of suppressing the primary cause of the evil,\r\nrepresented by a dental affection.\r\n\r\nA case observed by the surgeon Juton and communicated by him to the\r\nauthor is also a very important one. The patient was suffering with a\r\nlarge abscess on the right side of the lower jaw, accompanied by such\r\ngreat swelling of the cheek that it was impossible to open the mouth\r\nwide enough to examine the teeth. Juton proposed opening the abscess\r\nimmediately, but the patient would not consent. The following day\r\nhe was sent for in great haste. The gathering had changed its seat,\r\nmaking its way between the skin and muscles of the neck, where it now\r\nformed so huge a tumefaction that the patient was in danger of being\r\nsuffocated. The abscess was now immediately opened, but the swelling\r\nof the face still persisted; it was therefore only after a month had\r\nelapsed that it was possible to extract the root of the last molar,\r\nwhich had been the original cause of the whole malady. The surgeon\r\nobserved that the liquid injected into the fistulous opening in the\r\nneck issued from the alveolus of the last molar. After the extraction\r\nof the root a prompt recovery was effected.[445]\r\n\r\nThe second volume of Fauchard’s work is entirely devoted to operative\r\ndentistry and prosthesis.\r\n\r\nBefore speaking of the modes of cleaning, filing, and stopping the\r\nteeth, the author combats the opinion maintained by some, that these\r\noperations are in part useless, in part also dangerous, as having the\r\neffect of loosening the teeth, of depriving them of their enamel, and\r\nruining them.\r\n\r\nFauchard then describes the instruments proper for detaching the\r\ntartar;[446] he speaks of the method to be followed in cleaning the\r\nteeth in order to not endanger the enamel;[447] he speaks of the\r\ndifferent kinds of dental files, of their different uses in relation to\r\nthe various cases and indications; of the precautions to be taken in\r\nmaking use of them;[448] of the instruments to be used for scraping and\r\ncleaning the carious cavities and of the mode of employing them.[449]\r\n\r\nAll of the above-named instruments are illustrated by figures, in\r\ncontemplating which one cannot but reflect on the inferiority of the\r\ninstruments then in use as compared with those of the present day.\r\nThe greater admiration is therefore due to Fauchard’s talent, which,\r\nin spite of such imperfect and at times absolutely primitive means,\r\nenabled him to obtain the brilliant results cited in his observations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79\r\n\r\nInstruments for detaching dental tartar (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nChapter VI is dedicated to the stopping of decayed teeth. The sole\r\nmaterials used by the author for stopping were lead, tin, and gold.\r\n“Fine tin,” he says, “is preferable to lead, for lead turns black much\r\nmore easily and is much less durable; both are preferable to gold,\r\nbecause lighter and adapting themselves better to the unevenness of\r\nthe carious cavities. Besides, gold being dear, not everyone can or\r\nwill make the corresponding outlay.” The author here adds that those\r\nwho, from vanity or because possessed by the opinion that gold has\r\nspecial virtues, will not have their tooth stopped except with it, not\r\nunfrequently find dentists who, as the saying, goes, content them and\r\ncozen them by using leaf tin or lead colored yellow, and making them\r\npay for it as gold stopping!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80\r\n\r\nSome of the dental files used by Fauchard. The little\r\nsquare figure represents a small grooved wedge destined\r\nto be inserted in large interdental spaces, in order to\r\ngive more firmness to the teeth to be filed.]\r\n\r\nThe leaf metals were introduced and compressed into the carious\r\ncavities by means of three kinds of pluggers, which would nowadays be\r\nconsidered altogether insufficient and unfit for the purpose, but which\r\nthen, nevertheless, served to produce excellent stoppings. The author\r\nspeaks[450] of a lead stopping which had lasted in perfect condition\r\nfor forty years.\r\n\r\nBefore stopping the tooth the cavity was scraped and its opening\r\nwidened, if necessary, but no special form was given to the cavity\r\nitself, as is done at the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81\r\n\r\nInstruments for scraping the carious cavities (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nAs at that time the state of the dental pulp was not taken into\r\nconsideration before stopping a tooth, it often occurred that the\r\nstopping caused violent pain, which rendered its removal necessary.[451]\r\n\r\nFauchard says that “if the sensibility of the carious cavity be too\r\ngreat, the lead ought only to be pressed in very lightly at first,\r\nthen after one or two days a little more, continuing thus until it is\r\nproperly compressed and fitted in, always provided, of course, that the\r\npain does not increase. The sensitive parts of the tooth become thus\r\nmore easily used to the pressure of the lead, and the pain is in this\r\nmanner avoided or moderated.”[452]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82\r\n\r\nThree instruments for plugging teeth. The two small figures represent\r\nsilver plates for straightening teeth (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nThe author also makes the remark[453] that sometimes, in scraping a\r\ncarious cavity, “it is not possible to avoid uncovering and touching\r\nthe nerve with the instruments; one becomes aware of this by the pain\r\ncaused, and better still by a little blood issuing from the dental\r\nvessels.” In such cases, Fauchard advises stopping of the tooth\r\nimmediately, for if it be carried out with delay, it is sure to be\r\nfollowed by inflammation and great pain, rendering necessary the\r\nremoval of the lead or even the extraction of the tooth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83\r\n\r\nA gum lancet and two elevators, the second of which is destined to act\r\nfrom inside outward (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nCauterization of the teeth[454] continued to be much used in Fauchard’s\r\ntime, and this is very easily explainable when one considers that there\r\nwas not then any other means of destroying the dental pulp. In making\r\nuse of the actual cautery, the immediate end in view was to cause the\r\ncessation of obstinate toothache. “When the teeth give great pain and\r\nno relief is to be derived from the use of other remedies, one ought\r\nto cauterize the caries after having removed the extraneous substances\r\nthat may eventually be found in the carious cavity. After the\r\ncauterization one scrapes the cavity and fills it up with cotton-wool\r\nsoaked in oil of cinnamon. Later on one stops the tooth.”[455]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84\r\n\r\nAn extracting instrument called by Fauchard lever or tirtoire, and the\r\nhandle of a pelican without the hooks.]\r\n\r\nThe chapter in which Fauchard treats of the correction of dental\r\nirregularities is of particular interest. In speaking of his\r\nobservations, we have already seen that in this field also he knew\r\nhow to obtain splendid and admirable results. He, nevertheless, made\r\nuse of the most simple means—the file, pressure with the fingers,\r\ncommon threads or silk ones, little plates of silver or gold. At\r\ntimes, for straightening teeth, he made use of the pelican and the\r\nstraight pincers, afterward tying the teeth in their normal position.\r\nHe rarely had recourse to extraction as a means of carrying out dental\r\ncorrections.[456]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85\r\n\r\nFauchard’s simple pelican (with one changeable hook).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86\r\n\r\nFauchard’s double pelican.]\r\n\r\nTo steady loose teeth,[457] Fauchard, as did the ancients, made use\r\nof gold threads. When the spaces separating a loose tooth from\r\nthe neighboring ones were too large, he introduced small pieces of\r\nhippopotamus ivory into them of about the height of a line, and not\r\nexceeding the tooth itself in thickness; on each side of these was a\r\nvertical groove destined to serve as a support to the next tooth. Each\r\nof these pieces was furnished with two holes, through which were passed\r\nthe gold threads which served to bind together the teeth and the piece\r\nof ivory itself. This latter was fixed close down to the gum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87\r\n\r\nDental forceps (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nFauchard occupies himself in three different chapters (X, XI, XII) at\r\ngreat length with the extraction of teeth. He describes a pelican of\r\nhis own invention, and speaks of the advantages it presents over other\r\npelicans previously in use. Notwithstanding this, it cannot be said\r\nthat the instruments used by Fauchard for extracting teeth and roots\r\nshow a sensible improvement on those in use before his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88\r\n\r\nStraight forceps and crane’s bill or crow’s bill forceps (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nAmong the most usual operations, the author enumerates transplantation\r\nand especially replantation of the teeth.[458] Whenever, says\r\nFauchard, a wrong tooth is extracted by accident, it ought to be\r\nimmediately replanted, and the same ought to be done when violent pain\r\nrenders it necessary to extract a tooth that is not much decayed, as\r\nthe patient is thus relieved without losing the tooth.[459] Fauchard\r\nadds that this operation succeeds excellently in the case of incisors\r\nand canines, and very often, too, with small molars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89\r\n\r\nCutting forceps (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90\r\n\r\nCutting forceps (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nAfter having spoken of transplantation, he says:[460] “There is another\r\nmode of replacing human or natural teeth which I have never yet\r\nseen used except by a provincial dentist whose name I ignore.” This\r\nspecial method consists in the transplantation of a tooth—it matters\r\nlittle whether recently extracted or not—after having made three or\r\nfour notches in its root of about a line in depth. The author goes\r\non to describe all the particularities of the operation, and then\r\nadds: “After twenty-five or thirty days one removes the thread, and\r\nthe tooth is found to be firm in the alveolus, owing to the fact that\r\nthis latter, exercising a pressure on the root on every side, becomes\r\nperfectly moulded upon it. In this manner, the tooth will remain\r\nmortised, and may be preserved for a considerable time.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91\r\n\r\nPincers used by Fauchard in the operation of tying teeth\r\nwith gold wire. The three larger figures represent\r\nnatural or artificial teeth in which holes and horizontal\r\ngrooves have been made in order to fix them with gold\r\nthreads. The two smaller represent pieces of hippopotamus\r\nivory with a vertical groove on each side, destined to\r\nfill large interdental spaces and to steady loose teeth\r\nby means of gold ligatures.]\r\n\r\nThis method, invented by an unknown provincial dentist, has been\r\nrecently applied by Znamenski, of Moscow, for the implantation of\r\nartificial teeth made of porcelain, of caoutchouc, or gutta-percha.\r\n\r\nOne of Fauchard’s greatest merits consists in the improvements\r\nintroduced by him in dental prosthesis and in his having, besides, been\r\nthe first to treat of this most important part of dental art in a clear\r\nand particularized manner.\r\n\r\nThe materials then most used in dental prosthesis were human teeth,\r\nhippopotamus tusks, ivory of the best quality, and ox bone.[461]\r\n\r\nThe author minutely describes the methods to be followed to repair\r\ndental losses in every possible case and of whatever extent.\r\n\r\nAccording to the circumstances, Fauchard used, for maintaining\r\nartificial teeth in their place, linen, silk, or gold thread, passed\r\nthrough holes made in them, and tied to the natural teeth.\r\n\r\nWhen a set of two, three, four, or more teeth was to be applied,\r\nFauchard first prepared them separately and then united them together\r\nby means of one or two threads of gold or silver in such a manner\r\nthat the set formed at last a single piece, which was then fixed to\r\nthe natural teeth. When the piece consisted of several teeth it was\r\nreinforced with a small plate of gold or silver fixed to its inside\r\nby means of small tacks of the same metal riveted on one side to the\r\nplate, on the other to the front part of each tooth.\r\n\r\nThe author remarks that a similar prosthetic piece lasted longer than\r\nthose previously described, but required proportionately much more\r\nwork and much greater expense. He adds that, by employing this plate,\r\none can even dispense with threading and fixing the teeth together\r\nwith gold or silver wire; but that it was then necessary to make a\r\nhorizontal groove at the back of each tooth corresponding to the width\r\nand thickness of the plate, which could be fitted into the serial\r\ngroove and fixed to each single tooth by means of two small rivets.[462]\r\n\r\nAt other times the prosthesis was carried out in a single piece of\r\nmaterial (ivory, hippopotamus tusk, etc.) that was carved in such a\r\nmanner as to substitute exactly the teeth wanting, it being fixed to\r\nthe natural teeth in the usual manner.\r\n\r\nFauchard sometimes left the dental roots in their place (if they were\r\nin good condition), applying upon them artificial crowns, which he\r\neither bound to the neighboring teeth or fixed with screws to the\r\nrespective roots.\r\n\r\n“When one wishes to apply an artificial crown to the root of a natural\r\ntooth, one files away the part of the root that emerges above the gum,\r\nand even more if possible. One then removes, with proper instruments,\r\nall that is decayed in the root itself; after which one stops the root\r\ncanal with lead and fits the base of the artificial tooth to the root\r\nin such a manner that they correspond perfectly to each other. One\r\ndrills one or two holes in the tooth through which to pass the ends of\r\na thread, which serves to fasten it to the natural teeth on each side\r\nof it, as described above.\r\n\r\n“If the root canal has been very considerably enlarged by the carious\r\nprocess, so as to have rendered it necessary to stop it, the root\r\nbeing, nevertheless, still quite steady, one bores a small hole in the\r\nlead as deep and as straight as possible, without, however, penetrating\r\nfarther down than the root canal. The artificial crown is then united\r\nto the root by a pivot in the manner I shall now describe.”[463]\r\n\r\nThe method of applying pivot teeth is described with great accuracy.\r\nIn it the author considers all the different circumstances that may\r\npresent themselves, and says, among other things, that if the root is\r\nstill sensitive to pain, one should apply the actual cautery inside\r\nthe canal, before fitting the artificial crown to the root. For fixing\r\nthe pivot inside the artificial crown (which was generally the crown\r\nof a human tooth), Fauchard used a special cement made with gum lac,\r\nVenetian turpentine, and powdered white coral.[464]\r\n\r\nIn the case of there not being any whole teeth to which the prosthetic\r\npiece would be fixed, but only roots, Fauchard made two holes in it\r\nin perfect correspondence with the canals of two roots, and fixed the\r\nprosthetic piece to these by means of two pyramidal screws.[465]\r\n\r\nThis method suggests in a certain way the idea of bridge work.\r\n\r\nIn Chapters XVII, XVIII, XXIV, and XXV, Fauchard describes various\r\nmethods for the application of entire sets of false teeth, both upper\r\nand lower, as well as double.\r\n\r\nThe author says that if the lower jaw is entirely toothless, a set\r\nof teeth can be adapted thereto without the need of any special\r\ncontrivance; however, it is necessary that the prosthetic piece\r\nshould fit perfectly, so that the configuration of the maxillary arch\r\nand the irregularities of the gum, finding themselves in complete\r\ncorrespondence with the piece itself, may keep it steady in its place.\r\nThe support offered by the tongue interiorly, by the cheeks and the\r\nunder lip exteriorly, contributes to keep the artificial set steady;\r\none can thus masticate as easily with it as with one’s own teeth,\r\nespecially if the teeth of the upper jaw be still existing and the\r\nindividual be already sufficiently used to the wearing of it.[466]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the application of an entire set of upper teeth, one\r\nlearns from Fauchard that although some attempt had been made in this\r\ndirection before this time, the results had been very unsatisfactory.\r\nHe relates that: “In 1737 a lady of high rank, of about the age of\r\nsixty, who had not lost any of her lower teeth, but was deprived\r\nentirely of the upper ones, applied to M. Caperon, dentist to the King,\r\nwho was most able in his profession, in the hope that he might be able\r\nto furnish her mouth with an upper set. But he said that, no tooth\r\nwhatever being left in existence, every possible point of attachment\r\nwas wanting, and it would therefore be as difficult to do this as it\r\nwould be to build in the air.”[467] He, however, directed the lady\r\nto Fauchard, who asked for a few days to think the matter over, and\r\nsucceeded in devising a means of applying an upper set of teeth, which,\r\nin fact, entirely satisfied the wishes and wants of the client. “As\r\nthis lady,” says the author, “simply wished to have the front of her\r\nmouth decorated, and to be able to pronounce more perfectly, I gave\r\nless extension to the set. The lady eats easily with it and could not\r\nnow do without it. For greater convenience she has two similar sets,\r\nwhich she uses alternately.”[468]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92\r\n\r\nComplete dentures (Fauchard). _f. 3_ represents an enamelled denture\r\nwith artificial gums; _f. 4_ and _f. 5_, steel springs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93\r\n\r\nAn upper denture supported by springs fixed to a gold appliance which\r\nembraces the natural teeth of the lower jaw (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nThe author describes with great minuteness the manner in which the\r\nprosthetic apparatus in question was constructed and supported, and\r\nthen speaks of the successive improvements introduced by him into this\r\nmost important part of prosthetic dentistry, particularly in what\r\nregards the springs destined for the support of the upper set of teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94\r\n\r\nA spring denture for a case in which the lower front teeth still exist.\r\nFigs. 1 to 6, various parts of the apparatus (Fauchard).]\r\n\r\nFauchard also relates having made an attempt to apply an upper set of\r\nteeth without the aid of springs, which proved successful in three\r\ncases. “One can,” says he, “adopt an entire set of teeth to the upper\r\njaw, of much greater simplicity than those described, and which is\r\nmaintained in its place by the sole support of the cheeks and the lower\r\nteeth. It must be very light indeed and serves almost solely to improve\r\nthe appearance and the pronunciation; but when the individual gets used\r\nto it, he can also masticate with it. A set of teeth of this kind ought\r\nto adhere well to the gums and to be constructed in such a manner that\r\nthe cheeks may afford it sufficient pressure and support together with\r\nthe aid of the lower teeth; these latter sometimes bring it back into\r\nits place, without anyone perceiving the movement except the wearer\r\nhimself. Not long since I had to renovate a set of teeth of this kind\r\nmade by me more than twenty-four years ago, and worn by the owner to\r\nthe greatest advantage. I have since made two others which have proved\r\nmost useful to the persons wearing them. It is true that there are\r\nfew mouths adapted for wearing these sets, so much so that, excepting\r\nthe three referred to, I have never made any others. To be able to\r\nconstruct similar sets successfully, the dentist must be possessed of\r\nskill and ingenuity. Apart from this, they are the most suitable for\r\npersons who cannot spend much, as they cost less to make.”[469]\r\n\r\nFauchard did not merely content himself with having perfected dental\r\nprosthesis in the manner alluded to; he also succeeded in giving a\r\nquite natural appearance to artificial teeth. To reach this end he\r\nplaced the art of the enameller under contribution to the dental art.\r\nThus he had artificial pieces covered over with enamel, imparting\r\nto them the hue that seemed to him best adapted, and also imitating\r\nadmirably the natural color of the gums, so as to render the illusion\r\nperfect. The pieces to be enamelled were worked by special rules, which\r\nare minutely given in Chapter XIX of the second volume of his book.\r\n\r\nFauchard also brought the palatine prosthesis to a high degree of\r\nperfection. He describes five different obturators of the palate,\r\nwhich of themselves alone would be sufficient to testify to the highly\r\ninventive genius of the author, although they are defective in being\r\nsomewhat too complicated. Some of these fixtures are a combination of a\r\ndental set and palatine obturator.\r\n\r\nWe ought now to mention, in the order of chronology, some authors of\r\nlesser importance.\r\n\r\nVASSE and DE DIEST wrote about the danger of fatal hemorrhage following\r\non dental operations.[470] They report a few cases of this kind, giving\r\nthe blame of these accidents, however, to the carelessness of the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nLAVINI published in Florence, in the year 1740, a very good treatise on\r\ndentistry (_Trattato sopra la qualità de’ denti, col modo di cavarli,\r\nmantenerli e fortificarli_), which, however, marks no advance on the\r\nwork of Fauchard.\r\n\r\nM. BUNON (died 1749), a French dentist, wrote four admirable works on\r\ndentistry, which were published from 1741 to 1744. We will here briefly\r\nallude to the most salient ideas therein contained.\r\n\r\nThis author combated strenuously some prejudices then generally\r\ndiffused; such as that of its not being advisable to extract teeth\r\nduring pregnancy, and that of the extraction of an upper canine (eye\r\ntooth) being attended with great danger. He demonstrated the absurdity\r\nof the latter idea by putting in evidence the anatomical fact that the\r\nupper canines are innervated by the infra-orbital nerve, which does not\r\nstand in any relation whatever to the organ of sight.[471]\r\n\r\nAmong the other remedies recommended by him against the disorders\r\nand perils of first dentition, there is one most curious, not to say\r\nridiculous: he advises rubbing the nape of the neck, the shoulders, the\r\nback, and the lower limbs of the child, but in doing this the friction\r\nshould proceed from above downward, in order to offer resistance to\r\nthe flow of humors toward the upper parts of the body. The utility and\r\nefficacy of this kind of massage in favoring the process of dentition\r\nseems, of a truth, very open to question.\r\n\r\nBunon speaks at length of _erosion of the teeth_, and declares himself\r\nto be the discoverer of this disease, which destroys the enamel of the\r\nteeth already before their eruption. The first molars, the canines, and\r\nthe incisors are much more frequently damaged and affected by it than\r\nthe other teeth. According to Bunon, it is generally due to measles,\r\nsmallpox, malignant fevers, or scurvy, when children are subject to\r\nthese maladies during dentition, and more especially during the first.\r\nHe is of the opinion that erosion not only generates caries, but may be\r\nconsidered as being the origin of the greater part of dental affections.\r\n\r\nThis author distinguishes three principal kinds of dental tartar, the\r\nblack, the pale yellow, and the brownish yellow; he admits, however,\r\ntwo other kinds that are less frequent, that is, the red tartar and the\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\nHe relates having observed in the jaw of a child, who died at the age\r\nof three years and a half, a splintering of the alveolar parietes in\r\nall directions, and attributes this phenomena to disproportion between\r\nthe size of the teeth and the alveoli. On the basis of his anatomical\r\nobservations, he says that caries only appears on teeth that have\r\nalready come out of the gums, whilst erosion is produced in teeth not\r\nyet erupted, indeed, at times, several years previous to their eruption.\r\n\r\nWe will also mention, by way of a curiosity, Bunon’s proposal to\r\nsubstitute the word legs for that of dental roots.[472]\r\n\r\nFR. A. GERAULDY, a French dentist, wrote (1737) an excellent\r\ntreatise on dental maladies and on the mode of preserving the teeth.\r\nHis book, which was also translated into German,[473] contributed\r\nto the diffusion of knowledge relative to dental prophylaxis and\r\ntherapeutics, but apart from this brought no increment to the progress\r\nof practical dentistry. Some of the ideas of the author, however,\r\nmerit consideration. He clearly expresses the opinion that the shedding\r\nof the milk teeth is brought about by the pressure exercised upon them\r\nby the germs of the permanent teeth in course of development. The loss\r\nof the teeth in young subjects, or in those who have not yet reached\r\nforty years of age, is explained by the author in an altogether special\r\nmanner. He relates that Louis XIV, at the age of thirty-five, had lost\r\nall his upper teeth, and the considerations he makes on the subject\r\nbring him to the conclusion that the precocious loss of the upper teeth\r\ndepends in many cases on a paralysis of the nervous fibers that go to\r\nthem, which paralysis is probably caused by a dissolute and intemperate\r\nlife, having as its consequence the weakening of the organism and,\r\nabove all, of the nervous system. Without doubt there is some truth in\r\nGerauldy’s ideas, it being well known that the falling of the teeth (as\r\nwell as of the nails and the hair) often depends on nutritive disorders\r\nderiving from nervous disturbances. We have the clear proof of this in\r\ncertain cases of tabes dorsalis accompanied by the spontaneous falling\r\nof the teeth and nails.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH HURLOCK, an Englishman, published a treatise in 1742,[474] in\r\nwhich he warmly recommends lancing the gums in cases of difficult\r\ndentition; he declares this to be entirely without danger, and affirms\r\nthat it constitutes the sole means of salvation for not a few infants\r\nwho without it would die of convulsions.\r\n\r\nMOUTON, in 1746, that is, in the same year in which the second edition\r\nof Fauchard’s work was issued, gave to the light a monograph, the first\r\nextant, on mechanical dentistry.[475] The methods of this author for\r\nthe most part do not differ from those of Fauchard, nevertheless one\r\nfinds several important innovations in his work. To prevent the further\r\ndeterioration of teeth already much destroyed, and to preserve them\r\nsome time longer, Mouton had recourse to the application of “calottes\r\nd’or,” that is, gold crowns. He used this for the front teeth as well\r\nas for the molars, but in the former case he had them enamelled to give\r\nthem the same appearance as natural teeth.\r\n\r\nMouton also invented a new method of applying artificial teeth. Up to\r\nthen the ordinary method had been that of fixing them to the natural\r\nteeth by means of threads passed through holes made in the artificial\r\nteeth expressly for that purpose. Mouton is the first to speak of\r\nartificial teeth fixed to the natural teeth adjoining them by means of\r\nsprings or clasps.\r\n\r\nThis author relates having carried out several transplantations with\r\nperfect success, a thing that contributed greatly to his renown not\r\nonly in France, but also in England. He distinguished himself, besides,\r\nby the correction of dental irregularities. Lastly, it is to be\r\nnoted that this author frequently had recourse, as a remedy against\r\ntoothache, to the stretching of the dental nerve by means of moving and\r\npartially raising the tooth (subluxation).\r\n\r\nA. WESTPHAL. In proof of the great utility of lancing the gums in\r\ncases of difficult dentition, A. Westphal reports a case in which the\r\ndifficult eruption of an upper canine tooth provoked considerable\r\ninflammation and protrusion of the eye on the same side as the tooth;\r\nthese symptoms promptly disappeared, however, as soon as the gum was\r\nlanced down to the tooth itself.[476]\r\n\r\nJ. BERTIN also declares himself in favor of this operation; he\r\nrecommends never to neglect it in cases of difficult dentition, and to\r\nmake the said incisions deep and wide enough.[477]\r\n\r\nL. H. RUNGE, a surgeon of Bremen, published, in 1750, a monograph on\r\nthe diseases of the frontal and maxillary sinuses. He says that in\r\ncases of inflammation of Highmore’s antrum, the pus may make its way,\r\ncorroding the bone, as far as the alveoli, or, sometimes, as far as\r\nthe orbital cavity; and, _vice versa_, alveolar suppuration can give\r\nrise, by diffusion, to abscess of the maxillary sinus. In this latter,\r\ntumors of various kinds may form (polypi, cysts, sarcomas, cancers,\r\nexostosis), the existence of which is ignored at first, and only\r\nbecomes manifest tardily. Runge’s father, who was also a surgeon, had\r\noccasion to observe, and to treat an important case of disease of the\r\nmaxillary sinus, with considerable dilatation of the same, not only\r\non the side of the cheek, but also on the side of the palate and of\r\nthe nasal fossæ. With a strong scalpel he perforated the outer wall of\r\nthe antrum above the molars (keeping the cheek detached) and enlarged\r\nthe aperture by making the instrument turn around on its own axis,\r\nthus giving exit to a considerable quantity of non-purulent liquid.\r\nDetersive and aromatic injections were used for some time. The canine\r\ntooth, situated obliquely, having been extracted, its alveolus was\r\nfound to communicate with the antrum. From this moment, the injections\r\nbeing continued, a rapid improvement was obtained and the patient was\r\nso completely cured that no deformity of the face remained.\r\n\r\nRunge relates a case in which, having extracted a canine tooth, he\r\nfound a cyst adhering to its root. From this he is induced to believe\r\nthat in the case related above the disorder was also to be attributed\r\nto a large cyst having its origin in the root of the canine.\r\n\r\nAccording to him, the ozena always stands in relation to a suppurative\r\naffection of the maxillary sinus, and for its treatment one must,\r\ntherefore, have recourse to Drake’s operations.[478]\r\n\r\nGEORG HEURMANN, a surgeon in Copenhagen, recommends making use, after\r\nthe Cowper-Drake operation, of a small cannula in order to facilitate\r\nthe exit of the pathological material contained in the sinus, and\r\nalso to render it easier to introduce into it medicated or detersive\r\nsubstances.[479]\r\n\r\nLÉCLUSE. One of the most celebrated French dentists of the eighteenth\r\ncentury is Lécluse. Dental literature was enriched by him with several\r\nworks, partly written in popular style, partly addressed to dental\r\nspecialists. In 1750 he published his _Traité utile au public, où\r\nl’on enseigne la méthode de remédier aux douleurs et aux accidents\r\nqui précèdent et qui accompagnent la sortie des premières dents, de\r\nprocurer un arrangement aux secondes, enfin de les entretenir et de\r\nles conserver pendant le cours de la vie_. The work seems to have been\r\nvery favorably received, as its first edition, printed in Nancy, was\r\nfollowed by a second, printed in Paris, only four years later. In 1755\r\nhe published another book: _Eclaircissements essentiels pour parvenir\r\nà préserver les dents de la carie et le conserver jusqu’à l’extrème\r\nvieillesse_. But the most important of his works is the _Nouveaux\r\néléments d’odontologie_,[480] the first edition of which was published\r\nin 1754, and followed by a second in 1782.\r\n\r\nWe do not enter into a minute examination of these works, which, taken\r\naltogether, do not contain anything very new. We will only remark\r\nthat Lécluse treated in a succinct but correct manner the anatomy of\r\nthe mouth; invented some and perfected other instruments, the most\r\nimportant of which is the elevator that still bears his name, and\r\nfinally, that he frequently performed the operation of replantation,\r\nwarmly recommended by him as an excellent means of cure in certain\r\ncases of caries. The extracted tooth was stopped and afterward\r\nreplanted, and, says Lécluse, became fast within eight days, proving as\r\nserviceable as a perfectly healthy tooth, and never again causing any\r\npain.\r\n\r\nPHILIP PFAFF, dentist to Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, was\r\nthe first among the Germans who wrote a real treatise on dentistry.\r\nHis book[481] contains, in 184 succinctly but well-written pages, the\r\nanatomical and physiological notions relative to the teeth, as well as\r\nall that belongs to dental pathology, therapy, and prosthesis.\r\n\r\nBesides a few observations about supernumerary teeth, Pfaff relates\r\nseveral cases in which the incisors, inferior as well as superior,\r\nwere renewed (twice consecutively), that is, once at the usual epoch,\r\nand the second time between the seventh and thirteenth years. He also\r\ncites from the anatomical tables of Kulmus the following epitaph in low\r\nLatin, that seems to allude to a case of third dentition:\r\n\r\n  “Decanus in Kirchberg, sine dente canus, ut anus\r\n  Interum dentescit, ter juvenescit, his requiescit.”\r\n\r\nIn cases of hemorrhage ensuing on the extraction of teeth, the best\r\nhemostatic, according to Pfaff, is essence of turpentine, a remedy\r\nwhich in these cases he had always found efficient. He introduced a\r\nlittle ball of lint bathed in this essence as deeply as possible into\r\nthe alveolus, applying upon it some blotting paper reduced to pulp or\r\nsome dry lint that the patient compressed tightly by closing his teeth.\r\n\r\nGingival abscesses as well as fistulæ of the maxillary region almost\r\nalways owe their origin, says Pfaff, to decayed teeth, and can,\r\ntherefore, in general, not be cured except by the extraction of these\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\nThe prosthetic methods described by this author are, for the most\r\npart, identical with those of Fauchard and the other French dentists\r\nalready mentioned. As to the materials used for prosthesis at different\r\nperiods, Pfaff mentions, besides ivory, bone, hippopotamus tusk, teeth\r\nof sea cow, and human teeth, also teeth made of silver, of mother of\r\npearl, and even of copper enamelled.\r\n\r\nThe chief merit one must concede to Philip Pfaff is that of having\r\nbeen the first to make use of plaster models. It is, therefore, to\r\ntwo Germans—Pfaff and Purmann, the latter who, as we have already\r\nseen, used wax models—that one of the greatest progressive movements\r\nin dental prosthesis is indebted, that is, the method of taking casts\r\nand making models, of which method one finds no trace whatever in the\r\nauthors of antiquity, and which, it would appear, was not known even to\r\nFauchard himself. The wax casts of an entire jaw were taken by Pfaff\r\nin two pieces, one of the right half of the jaw, and the other of the\r\nleft; which were then reunited, and one thus avoided spoiling the cast\r\nin removing it from the mouth.\r\n\r\nAnother great merit of Philip Pfaff is that of having first carried out\r\nthe capping of an exposed dental pulp, previous to stopping a tooth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, Pfaff is not the first who, as Geist-Jacobi is\r\ninclined to believe,[482] _had dared to apply a filling over an exposed\r\ndental pulp without first cauterizing it_. As we have already seen,\r\nFauchard did not hesitate in the least to fill a tooth when the dental\r\npulp had become exposed in scraping the carious cavity. But the French\r\ndentist carried out, with much delicacy, a simple filling, whilst Pfaff\r\nfirst capped the dental nerve.\r\n\r\nJACOB CHRISTIAN SCHAFFER. In 1757 the evangelical pastor, J. Ch.\r\nSchaffer (we do not know if he was at the same time a dentist, or\r\nmerely an amateur in odontology), wrote a little book[483] to disprove\r\nthe existence of worms in decayed teeth, and to show the fallacy of\r\nbelieving that the supposed worms may be made to drop out by means of\r\nfumigations of henbane seeds. His book appeared, as a matter of fact,\r\nrather behind-hand, for in it Schaffer repeats in substance what\r\nHoullier had already said two centuries earlier, and after him various\r\nother authors, including Fauchard. At any rate, to coöperate in the\r\ncomplete destruction of error and in the diffusion of truth is always\r\nlaudable. We feel, however, bound to add that in the very same year in\r\nwhich Schaffer’s pamphlet was published, DUFOUR, a Frenchman, described\r\na worm that had been taken out of a decayed tooth, and called attention\r\nto the fact that it was altogether different from the “dental worms”\r\ndescribed by Andry.[484]\r\n\r\nBOURDET. An excellent book on dentistry[485] appeared in France in\r\nthe year 1757, the work of Bourdet, a celebrated dentist and elegant\r\nwriter, in whom the gifts of literary and scientific culture were\r\ncoupled with a vast experience and a profound spirit of observation.\r\nHis merits procured him the honor of being appointed dentist to the\r\nKing.\r\n\r\nThis author condemns as harmful the use of hard substances (such\r\nas bone rings, etc.) that people are in the habit of putting into\r\nchildren’s hands during the period of the first dentition, in the\r\nidea that by pressing these objects between the gums, as children\r\ninstinctively do, they cut their teeth more easily. As to emollients,\r\nhe holds them to be completely useless, and prefers to all these\r\nremedies the use of lemon juice.\r\n\r\nAccording to Bourdet, the teeth are so apt to decay, partly because\r\nof the frequent changes of temperature to which they are exposed, and\r\npartly because, differently from the bones, they are not provided with\r\nany protective organic covering.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of caries, Bourdet extracted the tooth, filled it with\r\nlead or gold leaf, and replanted it; but if, in extracting, the\r\nalveolus had been somewhat injured (a thing very likely to happen with\r\nthe instruments of the period), he replanted the tooth immediately, to\r\npreserve the alveolus from the damaging action of the air, and carried\r\nout the stopping at a later time.\r\n\r\nEven in certain cases of violent toothache not depending on caries,\r\nBourdet luxated the tooth and replaced it in position directly. But as\r\nsome dentists had accused him of having passed off as new an operation\r\nalready made known by Mouton since the year 1746, Bourdet defended\r\nhimself by saying that whilst Mouton only shook the tooth, raising it a\r\nlittle, simply to distend the nerve, he, instead, effected a complete\r\nluxation, in order altogether to interrupt the continuity of the nerve.\r\nAnyhow, this operation was not new, as it had already been recommended\r\nand practised by Peter Foreest, in the sixteenth century, and in an\r\neven more remote epoch by the Arabian surgeon Abulcasis.\r\n\r\nSometimes, when the permanent canine comes forth, it has not room\r\nenough, and therefore grows outward. In this case Bourdet extracts the\r\nfirst premolar; the canine then advances gradually of itself toward\r\nthe space left by the extracted tooth, until it occupies its place\r\nexactly. He also counsels the extraction of the first premolar on the\r\nopposite side of the jaw, in order to preserve the perfect symmetry of\r\nthe dental arch on both sides. When the arch formed by the jaws is too\r\nlarge and of an ugly appearance, Bourdet advises extracting the first\r\nupper and lower premolars, so that the maxillary arches may acquire a\r\nmore regular form. In cases in which the defect of form exists only in\r\nthe lower jaw, that is, in children who have protruding chins, Bourdet\r\ncorrects this deformity by extracting the first lower molars shortly\r\nafter their eruption, that is, toward seven years of age. In this\r\nmanner, says the author, the lower jaw grows smaller and the deformity\r\ndisappears. The inventor of this method, as Bourdet himself tells us,\r\nwas the dentist Capuron.\r\n\r\nBourdet made prosthetic pieces, whose base, representing the gums\r\nand the alveoli, was made entirely of gold and covered over with\r\nflesh-colored enamel on the outside, so as to simulate the natural\r\nappearance of the gums; the teeth were adjusted into the artificial\r\nalveoli and fixed with small pins. At other times he made use of a\r\nsingle piece of hippopotamus tusk, in which he carved not only the\r\nbase, but also the three back teeth on each side, whilst the ten front\r\nteeth were human teeth fixed to the base with rivets.\r\n\r\nOne of Bourdet’s principal merits is that of having brought artificial\r\nplates to perfection by fixing them not, as heretofore, to the opening\r\nof the palate or inside the nose, but by means of lateral clasps fitted\r\nto the teeth.\r\n\r\nIn a special pamphlet, published in 1764,[486] Bourdet treats of the\r\ndiseases of Highmore’s antrum. To facilitate the exit of pathological\r\nhumors from the sinus, after the Cowper operation, he introduced a\r\nsmall cannula, forked at one end, into the antrum and fixed the two\r\nbranches of the fork to the neighboring teeth by tying.\r\n\r\nIn some diseases of the maxillary sinus (polypus, sarcoma, etc.)\r\nBourdet recommends cauterizing.\r\n\r\nBesides his principal work, the pamphlet on the diseases of Highmore’s\r\nantrum, and some others of less importance, Bourdet wrote an excellent\r\nbook on dental hygiene,[487] which had the honor of two translations,\r\none German, the other Italian; the latter published in Venice in 1773.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated author inveighs bitterly against charlatans and quack\r\ndentists, and throws light on all their impostures. It appears,\r\nhowever, that in the midst of this despicable class, so justly\r\ncondemned by him, there existed a courageous though unscientific\r\noperator, to whom posterity would have attributed due honor had his\r\nname been handed down, for he was the first, in all probability, to\r\ntry the implanting of teeth in artificial alveoli. This is, at least,\r\nwhat we deduce from a passage in one of Bourdet’s works, in which we\r\nread that a charlatan sought to impose on the public the belief that\r\nhe could make a hole in the jawbone and plant therein an expressly\r\nprepared artificial tooth, which in a brief space of time would become\r\nperfectly firm and as useful as a natural one. Bourdet adds that an\r\nattentive investigation led to the recognition of the said tooth being\r\nsimply that of a sheep. It would appear, therefore, that the operation\r\nhad been in reality performed, it matters but little whether with the\r\ntooth of a sheep or with one of another kind.\r\n\r\nJOURDAIN was another eminent writer on dental matters, at this period.\r\nRather than a true surgeon-dentist like Fauchard and Bourdet, Jourdain\r\nwas a general surgeon who had dedicated himself with particular\r\npredilection to the study and treatment of oral and maxillary diseases.\r\nAnd precisely for this reason his writings, although of great\r\nscientific importance, are far from possessing for dental art, properly\r\nso-called, the same value as the works of Fauchard, Bourdet, and other\r\ngreat dentists of the eighteenth century. His works, as Geist-Jacobi\r\njustly observes, give us the impression of his having been a theorist\r\nrather than a practical dentist.\r\n\r\nIn 1759 Jourdain described in the _Journal de Médecine_[488] an\r\nimproved pelican and another instrument to be used for straightening\r\nteeth inclined inward. Two years later he published his treatise on\r\nthe diseases of Highmore’s antrum and on fractures and caries of the\r\nmaxillary bone.[489] After this, appeared his book on the formation of\r\nthe teeth.[490] He therein describes with great accuracy the dental\r\nfollicle from its first appearing to the moment of birth, following\r\nit throughout its evolution. This lengthy book is most interesting,\r\nfor it is not a mere compilation, but gives the results of personal\r\nresearch and experience. But by far the most important of all the works\r\nof this author is his treatise on the diseases and surgical operations\r\nof the mouth.[491] This book went through several French editions,\r\nwas translated into German in 1784, and has had, besides, two English\r\neditions in America of comparatively recent date, that is, at Baltimore\r\nin 1849, and at Philadelphia in 1851; all of which proves the great\r\nvalue of the work; it treats, however, much more of general surgery\r\nof the mouth and neighboring regions than of dental art properly so\r\ncalled. The first volume of 626 pages is almost entirely dedicated\r\nto the diseases of the maxillary sinus, which, for this author, were\r\never the object of favorite and particular study. He is not in favor\r\nof carrying out irrigation of the antrum through the mouth, even when\r\nan alveolar opening has resulted spontaneously through the extraction\r\nof a decayed tooth; he prefers instead, whenever this is possible, the\r\nreopening of the nasal orifice, by means of sounds and cannulæ adapted\r\nfor the purpose, that is, varying in thickness and in length, and\r\ncurved according to the necessities of the case. The natural opening of\r\nthe antrum being reëstablished, one irrigates the cavity through it by\r\nmeans of a cannula to which a small syringe has been screwed. When the\r\nteeth are sound, notwithstanding the diseased condition of the antrum,\r\nJourdain is absolutely contrary to the performing of the Cowper-Drake\r\noperation. When, on the contrary, the malady owes its origin to decayed\r\nteeth, Jourdain extracts them, but, as already said, carries out the\r\ndetersive and medicated injections through the natural opening.\r\n\r\nThe author divides the collections of the maxillary sinus into purulent\r\nand lymphatic. The purulent are painful and corrode the bone, the\r\nlymphatic are not painful and do not corrode the bone, but distend and\r\nsoften it, producing external tumefaction which yields to pressure,\r\nand, on this being diminished, gave out a characteristic sound. These\r\nso-called lymphatic gatherings referred to by Jourdain are none other\r\nthan mucous cysts of the maxillary sinus. Also the other diseases\r\nof Highmore’s antrum (polypi, etc.) are taken by this author into\r\nattentive and minute consideration.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the work is dedicated to the other diseases of the\r\nmaxillary bones (especially of the inferior one), as well as to those\r\nof the lips, cheeks, salivary ducts, gums, frenum linguæ, etc. Dental\r\nhemorrhage and difficult dentition are also spoken of in this volume.\r\n\r\nThe author relates, with regard to the latter subject, that he had\r\nobserved, in corpses of infants who had succumbed to a difficult\r\ndentition, that the crowns of the erupting teeth were covered by the\r\nalveolar margins folded upon them. This, according to him, must be the\r\nreason why even lancing of the gums proves useless in some cases of\r\ndifficult dentition; it is therefore necessary, whenever it is possible\r\nto recognize the existence of this state of things, to destroy the bony\r\nmargins that oppose the erupting of the teeth; the author declares that\r\nhe has frequently done this, with fortunate results.\r\n\r\nIn 1784 Jourdain published a treatise on artificial dentures.[492]\r\nHe therein specially speaks of a complete denture with four springs,\r\nperfectly adapted to the purpose of mastication. The author attributes\r\nthe merit of its invention to MASSEZ, who had imagined it toward 1772.\r\nIf we may judge, however, by what Joseph Linderer says,[493] this\r\ndenture appears to have been too complicated, even when compared with\r\nthose described by Fauchard.\r\n\r\nLAMORIER and RUSSEL, contemporaries of Jourdain, also studied the\r\ndiseases of the maxillary sinus, and published in the _Mémoires\r\nde l’Académie de Chirurgie_, vol. iv, several important cases of\r\npolypi and other diseases of the antrum. Lamorier is not in favor\r\nof the Cowper-Drake operation. He recommends perforating the antrum\r\nimmediately above the first molars, or rather between it and the malar\r\nbone. In this he seems to have been influenced by the considerations\r\nthat the wall of the cavity here presents the least thickness, and that\r\nthis is the most dependent part of the sinus. But he did not always\r\ndeem it necessary to make a perforation here, when a fistulous opening\r\nhad previously formed in some other place. His method of operating is\r\nas follows: The jaws being closed, the angle of the mouth is drawn\r\noutward and slightly upward with a curved instrument called by the\r\nauthor a speculum; this done, the gum is incised below the molar\r\napophysis and the bone laid bare, and then pierced with a spear-pointed\r\npunch. The opening is afterward enlarged if found necessary.\r\n\r\nSeveral contributions to the knowledge of the diseases of the maxillary\r\nsinus and their treatment were made about this time by Beaupréau,\r\nDubertrand, Caumont, Dupont, Chastanet, Doublet, David, and especially\r\nby Thomas Bordenave, who published an important work on this subject,\r\ncollecting a great number of clinical cases of great interest. Speaking\r\nof the Cowper-Drake operation, he expresses the opinion that the tooth\r\nto be extracted is not the same in all cases, for if some one of the\r\nteeth situated below the maxillary sinus should either show signs of\r\ndecay or be the seat of persistent pain, the choice should fall upon\r\nthat one. If, however, these teeth are all apparently sound, the one\r\nshould be chosen that, under percussion, is most sensible to pain. In\r\nthose cases in which the choice is altogether free, Bordenave prefers\r\nthe extraction of the first large molar, for the double reason that\r\nit is generally situated in correspondence to the central part of the\r\ncavity, and that it is separated from the antrum by a very thin osseous\r\nlamina. In certain cases, the maxillary sinus is divided, by body\r\nlamellæ, into various cavities, and then, as one easily understands,\r\nit may be necessary to extract more than one tooth for the evacuation\r\nof the pathological contents. When the teeth situated below the antrum\r\nhave fallen out, or have been extracted some time, and their alveoli\r\nare in consequence obliterated, it will be better to have recourse\r\nto Lamorier’s method. This method may besides be useful, according\r\nto Bordenave, either when all the teeth are sound and it would\r\nconsequently be a pity to sacrifice any of them, or in special cases\r\n(such as large polypi of Highmore’s antrum, extraneous bodies, etc.) in\r\nwhich the Cowper-Drake operation would not afford sufficient space.\r\n\r\nL. B. LENTIN, a German, in 1756, published a pamphlet[494] in which\r\nhe recommended electricity as a means of cure for toothache. Other\r\nwriters recommended the use of the magnet, which means of cure had\r\nalready been advised for various affections by Patacelus. During the\r\nlatter half of the seventeenth century, Talbot, J. J. Weckes, and P.\r\nBorelli related several cures of headache and toothache by the use of\r\nthe magnet. In the eighteenth century F. W. Klaerich, a medical man\r\nin Göttingen, wrote that he had used the magnet advantageously in not\r\nless than 130 cases of toothache.[495] We find it recommended later by\r\nothers, Brunner, and particularly J. G. Teske, who, in 1765, wrote a\r\npamphlet entitled _New experiments for the curing of toothache by means\r\nof magnetic steel_.[496]\r\n\r\nHe considers the use of the magnet as the most efficacious of all\r\nremedies against toothache, and believes its action to be similar to\r\nthat of electricity.\r\n\r\nIn the following year, however, the belief in the new means of cure was\r\nsensibly shaken by F. E. Glaubrecht, who declared that although the\r\nmagnet calms or causes the cessation of the pain at first, it returns\r\nconstantly and with much greater violence.[497] The curing efficacy\r\nof the magnet in cases of toothache was highly vaunted in France by\r\nCondamine.[498]\r\n\r\nPASCH attributes the effects of the magnet to the chill produced in the\r\nparts to which it is applied; in proof of this he adduces the fact that\r\nif the magnet becomes heated by being kept some time in the hand, it\r\nloses its efficacy altogether, whilst on the other side one may obtain\r\nthe very same beneficial results with a simple steel spatula, just on\r\naccount of the action of the cold; finally, he adds that the chill\r\nproduced by the magnet on the affected part explains very well not only\r\nthe good, but also the bad effects which it produces in many cases,\r\nsuch as increase of the pain, inflammation, tumefaction, and even at\r\ntimes spasmodic contractions.[499] Thenceforth the enthusiasm for the\r\nmagnetic cure diminished gradually, all the more so inasmuch as that\r\nshortly after the celebrated English dentist Thomas Berdmore ridiculed\r\nit by placing it in the same class as charms, exorcisms, and other\r\nfoolish and superstitious means of cure.[500]\r\n\r\nADAM ANTON BRUNNER. One of the most distinguished German dentists in\r\nthe second half of the eighteenth century was Adam Anton Brunner. His\r\ntwo principal works are the _Introduction to the science necessary\r\nfor a dentist_,[501] and the _Treatise on the eruption of the milk\r\nteeth_.[502]\r\n\r\nThis author falls into various errors with regard to deciduous teeth.\r\nAccording to him they are twenty-four in number, and without roots; but\r\nthese may develop in those milk teeth which in exceptional cases remain\r\nin their places after the period in which they generally are shed.\r\n\r\nA milk tooth, says Brunner, ought never to be extracted unless there be\r\nmanifest signs of the presence of the corresponding permanent tooth, or\r\nwhen it is painful and decayed. Badly grown teeth can often be put in\r\norder solely by the pressure of the fingers frequently repeated, but\r\nwhen this is not sufficient, one must have recourse to waxed threads or\r\nto special contrivances.\r\n\r\nIn applying a pivot tooth, he screws the pivot to the artificial crown\r\nand perforates the root canal only just sufficiently to admit the other\r\nextremity, which he drives in by little strokes of a hammer upon the\r\ncrown, without its being necessary to use cement. We learn from this\r\nauthor that in his time there were turners and other craftsmen who\r\noccupied themselves with dental prosthesis.[503]\r\n\r\nBrunner prefers gold for fillings to any other substance whatever.\r\n\r\nJ. G. PASCH, whose name we have already mentioned, relates the case of\r\na young maidservant becoming suddenly affected with deafness, and who\r\nrecovered her hearing completely on the eruption of one of her wisdom\r\nteeth. From a passage of this author’s we learn that at that time\r\nmany had recourse to the crushing of the infra-orbital nerve as a cure\r\nfor certain cases of toothache. He, however, decidedly rejects such a\r\nremedy, as it proves for the most part ineffectual and may, besides,\r\nproduce very serious consequences. This author carried out many\r\nexperiments as to the effects of acids on the teeth.[504]\r\n\r\nC. A. GRÄBNER[505] recommends not deceiving children by extracting\r\ntheir teeth unexpectedly, but rather to persuade them of the necessity\r\nof the operation; for by deceiving them one loses their confidence, and\r\nin many cases inspires them with an invincible aversion to the dentist.\r\n\r\nThis author invented a so-called “calendar of dentition,” for the\r\npurpose of showing at a glance the period of eruption of each of\r\nthe deciduous and permanent teeth, and as well for noting down the\r\ntime at which the various teeth are changed, so as to avoid every\r\npossible error in this respect. This calendar consists of a figure or\r\ndiagram representing the two dental arches, with transversal lines\r\nthat separate the different teeth one from the other, the relative\r\nindications being also given.\r\n\r\nThe observations of this most sensible and conscientious dentist with\r\nregard to the extraction of teeth are worthy of note: “The haphazard\r\npulling out of a tooth is an easy enough thing; the only requisites for\r\ndoing this are impudence and the audacity natural to the half-starved\r\ncharlatan. But to carry out the extraction of a tooth in such a manner\r\nthat, whatever be the circumstances of the case, no disgrace may accrue\r\nto the operator or damage to the patient, requires serious knowledge,\r\nability, and prudence.”\r\n\r\nRUEFF relates the case of a man, aged forty years, who, having made\r\nuse of fumigations of henbane seeds to relieve himself of violent\r\ntoothache, obtained the desired end, but at the same time lost his\r\nvirile power. He, however, reacquired his force by the care of the\r\nauthor.[506]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS BERDMORE was the dentist of George III of England, and one of\r\nthe first and most eminent representatives of the dental art in that\r\ncountry. Before him, no one had had the appointment of dentist to\r\nthe royal family. In the year 1768 he published an excellent work on\r\ndentistry,[507] that was translated into various languages and went\r\nthrough many editions; the last of these appeared in Baltimore in the\r\nyear 1844, that is, seventy-six years after the first English edition—a\r\nsplendid proof of the worth and fame of this work.\r\n\r\nBerdmore contributed to the progress of dentistry in England not only\r\nby his writings, but also by imparting theoretical and practical\r\ninstruction to many medical students desirous of practising dental art\r\nas a specialty.[508] One of these was ROBERT WOOFFENDALE, who went to\r\nAmerica in the year 1766, and was the first dentist whose name is there\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nBerdmore considers as the principal advantage of the application of\r\nsingle artificial teeth the support they afford to the neighboring\r\nones. Although in no way an impassioned partisan of dental grafting,\r\nlike his contemporary, the celebrated surgeon Hunter, he, nevertheless,\r\nsometimes had recourse to replantation, recognizing the advantages to\r\nbe derived from this operation, provided it be ably and opportunely\r\ncarried out; but he was decidedly averse to transplantation. Before\r\ndefinitely inserting a gold filling, Berdmore considers it a good\r\npractice to try the tolerance of the tooth with a temporary filling\r\nof cement or some other like substance. His experiments as to the\r\naction of acids on the teeth are most interesting. He found that nitric\r\nacid destroys the enamel in a quarter of an hour; muriatic acid acts\r\nalmost as rapidly, but with the difference that it also alters the\r\ncolor of the interior parts; sulphuric acid renders the teeth very\r\nwhite, and, even if used for three or four days, only destroys a small\r\nportion of the dental substance, but by reason of its action the enamel\r\nbecomes rough and can be easily scraped away with a knife. Remarkable\r\nexperiments on this subject were also made later by Kemme.[509]\r\n\r\nPIERRE AUZEBI, a dentist at Lyons, published a treatise on odontology\r\nin 1771, which is only remarkable for certain strange ideas that he\r\ntherein exposes, the entire book being in complete contradiction with\r\nthe great progress already realized, at that period, in dental science.\r\nAuzebi likens the human body to a hydraulic machine, formed by the\r\nunion of solid and liquid parts. For him the bones are merely _folded\r\nmembranes_ and the teeth are _bones composed of small membranes_. The\r\nauthor declares that he is unable to admit the theory of germs in the\r\ngenesis of the teeth because “these germs, being all in identical\r\nconditions as to heat and moisture, ought all to develop at the same\r\ntime like the grains of corn in a field.” Rather than having their\r\norigin from special germs, the teeth, he says, are derived from\r\nlymph, this being, according to Auzebi, the fundamental substance\r\nfrom which all the hard parts of the body are generated. A drop of\r\nlymph gathered at the bottom of the alveolus hardens and constitutes\r\nthe first beginning in the formation of the teeth. Beneath this other\r\nlymph is gradually collected, which pushes upward and the part of the\r\ntooth already formed, surrounds the dental vessels, and thus becomes\r\nthe root of the tooth. To facilitate dentition he recommends, among\r\nother things, rubbing the gums with hard, rough, and angular bodies.\r\nHe also maintains, as does Brunner, that the milk teeth have no roots,\r\ncontradicting, in this respect, the opinion of Fauchard, of Bunon, of\r\nBourdet, who decidedly affirm that the deciduous teeth are furnished\r\nwith roots, precisely the same as the permanent ones. According to\r\nhim, when it so happens that the milk teeth have roots, they are not\r\nshed. To calm toothache, the author recommended a sedative elixir,\r\nthe aspirating of a few drops of which sufficed to obtain the desired\r\neffect.[510]\r\n\r\nJOHN AITKIN, in 1771, perfected the English key, so as to render the\r\nextraction of the teeth easier and to avoid the danger of fracturing\r\nthe alveolus or the tooth itself, and of injuring the gums.[511]\r\n\r\nFRÈRE CÔME, a celebrated French surgeon, also contributed to the\r\nperfecting of this instrument.[512]\r\n\r\nIn 1771-72, Fr. L. Weyland and Henkel recorded some very important\r\ncases of diseases of Highmore’s antrum.[513]\r\n\r\nW. BROMFIELD, in a collection of surgical observations and cases\r\npublished in London in the year 1773, also speaks of affections of the\r\nmaxillary sinus. He says that he has had opportunity of persuading\r\nhimself that the purulent gatherings of this cavity not unfrequently\r\ndischarge spontaneously during the night, finding their exit through\r\nthe natural orifice of the antrum, when the body is in the horizontal\r\nposition.[514]\r\n\r\nJOHN HUNTER, the celebrated surgeon, must be named among the most\r\nillustrious champions of odontology in England. He was born February\r\n13, 1728. His first instructor in medical studies was his brother,\r\nWilliam Hunter, a scientist of great merit, whose school of anatomy in\r\nLondon was attended by numerous students from all parts of the British\r\nKingdom. Under so excellent a guide John Hunter made rapid progress,\r\nand in less than twenty years became the most famous physiologist and\r\nprofessor of surgery of that day. He was surgeon-general to the English\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nHis _Natural History of the Human Teeth_ (London, 1771) and his\r\n_Practical Treatise on the Diseases of the Teeth_ (London, 1778)\r\ninitiated in England a new epoch for the dental art, which, abandoning\r\nits blind empiricism, began to take its stand on the basis of rigorous\r\nscientific observation.\r\n\r\nBut although Hunter’s merits were great with respect to the scientific\r\ndevelopment of odontology, we must remember that he was a general\r\nsurgeon, and not a dentist, and that precisely for this reason he had\r\nnot, neither could he have, other than a restricted personal experience\r\nrelative to the treatment of dental diseases. This explains why the\r\nanatomical and physiological part of Hunter’s works on the teeth is so\r\nfar superior to the part concerning practical treatment.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in the field of practice, this author often falls into grave\r\ncontradictions, and is frequently hesitating and uncertain on important\r\npoints of dental therapeutics.\r\n\r\nHunter gives a very long and detailed description of all the parts\r\nconstituting the oral cavity and the masticatory apparatus. He sought\r\nto establish a scientific nomenclature for the teeth, and in fact the\r\ndenominations of _cuspidati_ for the canine teeth and of _bicuspids_\r\nor _bicuspidati_ for the small molars originated with him. Hunter says\r\nthat the enamel of the teeth is a fibrous structure, and that its\r\nfibers depart from the body of the tooth like rays. He believes it\r\nto be entirely inorganic, as it is absolutely impossible to convert\r\nit into animal mucus. The tooth is constituted for the most part by\r\na long mass (it is thus he calls the dentine), which is, however,\r\nmuch harder and denser than any other bone. This part of the tooth is\r\nformed of concentric lamellæ, and is vascular, as is proved by the\r\nexostosis of the roots and the adhesions that exist at times between\r\nthe roots and the alveoli. Hunter gives a good description of the\r\npulp cavity and of the pulp itself. He studied odontogeny with great\r\ncare, as is demonstrated by his special researches on this point. He\r\nadmits the existence of distinct germs for the enamel and for the\r\ndentine. According to him the incisors are formed from three points\r\nof ossification, the canines from one, and the molars from three\r\nor four. The tooth after its eruption is an extraneous body “with\r\nrespect to a circulation through its substance, but they have most\r\ncertainly a living principle by which means they make part of the\r\nbody, and are capable of uniting with any part of a living body.” The\r\nmilk teeth, says Hunter, are not shed by a mechanical action of the\r\nsecond teeth, but by an organizing law of Nature. The physiology of\r\nthe masticatory apparatus is treated by Hunter with great accuracy and\r\nmost extensively. This author combats, by many arguments, the opinion\r\nthat the teeth grow continually; he explains the apparent lengthening\r\nof those teeth whose antagonists are wanting, by the tendency of\r\nthe alveoli to fill up, which, however, is not possible in normal\r\nconditions, because of the constant pressure exercised upon the teeth\r\nby their antagonists.\r\n\r\nCaries, says Hunter, is a disease of altogether obscure origin; it is\r\nnot owing to external irritation or to chemical processes, and seems to\r\nbe a morbid form altogether peculiar to the teeth. Only in very rare\r\ncases does it attack the roots of the teeth. It rarely appears after\r\nfifty years of age. Hunter does not admit that this disease may be\r\ncommunicated by one tooth to another. As to its treatment, the caries,\r\nif superficial, may be completely removed by filing the decayed part\r\nof the tooth before the disease penetrates to the cavity, and its\r\nspreading will thus be arrested for a time at least. In cases where\r\nthe caries penetrates to some depth, without, however, the destruction\r\nof the crown of the tooth being so extensive as to render it useless,\r\nHunter believed the best mode of treatment to be extraction and\r\nreplanting of the tooth after having subjected it to boiling in order\r\nto cleanse it perfectly and to destroy its vitality entirely, this\r\nbeing, according to him, the mode of preventing the further destruction\r\nof the tooth, which once dead can no longer be the seat of any disease.\r\nIf, instead, one wishes to have recourse to cauterization of the\r\nnerve, it is necessary to reach as far as the apex of the root; which,\r\nhowever, is not always possible. This is a very important point, for no\r\none before Hunter had yet affirmed the necessity of entirely destroying\r\nthe diseased pulp as an indispensable condition of the success of the\r\nfilling to be later carried out in order to conserve the tooth.\r\n\r\nHunter is extremely concise when speaking of the filling of teeth;\r\nconsidering the great importance of this argument, his conciseness can\r\nonly depend on his having had no personal experience in the matter. He\r\nconsiders lead preferable for fillings.\r\n\r\nThe frequent occurrence of erosion of the teeth, whether of the\r\ncuneiform variety or of other kinds, did not escape the attention of\r\nthis acute observer, but he was not able to give any explanation of it.\r\n\r\nIn cases of empyema of Highmore’s antrum, Hunter advises the opening of\r\nthe cavity through the alveolus of the first or second large molar.\r\n\r\nPeriodontitis is classified by the author among the diseases of the\r\nalveolar process. He occupies himself with this affection at great\r\nlength, seeking to explain the mode in which it is produced. He\r\ndistinguishes two forms of the disease, according to whether or not\r\nthere be exit of pus from the alveolus. The alveolar process is,\r\nin his opinion, the principal seat of the disease, to which, as a\r\ncomplication, is added the retraction of the gums. For the diseased\r\nalveolus the tooth becomes, in a certain manner, an extraneous body, of\r\nwhich it tends to rid itself. The alveolar margins undergo absorption;\r\nthe bottom of the alveolus tends to fill up, analogously to what occurs\r\nafter extraction, and the falling out of the tooth ensues as a natural\r\nconsequence of this process. An altogether similar process, producing\r\nthe falling out of the teeth, is the normal consequence of senility.\r\n\r\nThe author considers that the malady in question has as its point of\r\ndeparture an irritation caused by a tooth; and as almost a proof of\r\nthis he relates a case in which the extraction of the affected tooth,\r\nan upper incisor which became too long, and the transplantation of\r\nanother tooth caused the cessation of the morbid process and the\r\nperfect consolidation of the transplanted tooth. However, Hunter does\r\nnot draw from this isolated case the conclusion that transplantation\r\nmay be elevated to a method of cure for this malady. Indeed, he says\r\nthat, so far as is known to him, there is no means of prevention\r\nor of cure for it. His treatment, therefore, is merely directed to\r\nthe curing, in so far as is possible, the phlogistic symptoms, by\r\nscarifications of the gum and by the use of astringent remedies. He\r\ndoes not exclude the possibility of a complete recovery, but the mode\r\nin which this obtains seems to him as obscure as is the nature of the\r\ndisease itself.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the correction of dental irregularities, Hunter advises\r\nnot to extract the milk teeth unless this be an absolute necessity.\r\nHe says, besides, that it is useless to extract any tooth whatever,\r\nunless one endeavors at the same time to force the irregular tooth or\r\nteeth into their normal position by exercising the requisite pressure\r\nupon them. In young subjects the regulating of crooked teeth is an easy\r\nmatter, because of the softness of the maxillary bone. However, it\r\nshould not be undertaken before all the bicuspids have come through.\r\nTo correct protrusion of the upper jaw, the author recommends the\r\nextraction of a bicuspid on each side. To regulate the incisors it is\r\nsometimes necessary to make them rotate on their axis with the forceps.\r\nIn certain cases of protrusion of the lower jaw one may have recourse\r\nwith advantage to the inclined plane.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, it is useless to lay bare a tooth with the\r\nlancet before extracting it, although in certain cases this may be\r\nadvantageous in order to render its extraction easier and less painful.\r\n\r\nHunter was a strenuous partisan of replantation and transplantation of\r\nthe teeth; he made various experiments on animals, and treated this\r\nimportant argument with particular fulness and much better than had\r\nbeen done up to then by others.\r\n\r\nIn cases of difficult dentition he considered incision of the gums most\r\nuseful and, if necessary, to be had recourse to several times.\r\n\r\nFOUCOU, the French dentist, in 1774, made known a compressor invented\r\nby him for arresting hemorrhage ensuing on the extraction of teeth.\r\nThis instrument, which could be used for either jaw, exercised its\r\npressure not only in a vertical direction, but also laterally, and\r\ndid not give much inconvenience to the patient. Carabelli, who wrote\r\nseventy years later, speaks with praise of Foucou’s compressor, which\r\nhe considers the best instrument of its kind.\r\n\r\nCOURTOIS, in his book published in 1775,[515] says that the enamel\r\nof the teeth only reaches its perfection of development at twenty\r\nto twenty-two years of age, and begins thenceforward to wear away\r\ngradually. In speaking of the enamel, he advises avoiding the use of\r\nthe file as much as possible. This author’s book is interesting for the\r\nmany important clinical cases it contains.\r\n\r\nWILLICH, in 1778, related a most curious case relating to a woman,\r\naged forty years, who had never had her menstrual function, but\r\nhad, nevertheless, given birth to two children; the extraction of a\r\ntooth was followed by an alveolar hemorrhage that lasted an hour;\r\nthenceforward, this hemorrhage recurred regularly each month, for the\r\nspace of eight years.\r\n\r\nBÜCKING, in 1782, published a _Complete Guide to the Extraction of\r\nthe Teeth_,[516] wherein he minutely describes all the instruments,\r\ntheir use, the position of the operator and of the patient, indicating\r\nat the same time the instruments best adapted for the extraction of\r\neach tooth. He declares himself averse to the practice of subluxation\r\nas a means of cure for toothache, a method which, first recommended\r\nby the Arab physician Avicenna, and later, in the sixteenth century,\r\nby Peter Foreest, had fallen into oblivion for a long time, and was\r\nagain brought into credit by two celebrated French dentists, Mouton\r\nand Bourdet, the latter of whom relates having had recourse to it\r\nsuccessfully in not less than six hundred cases.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the high authority of this illustrious dentist, Bücking\r\ndoes not consider this method of cure advisable, adducing, however,\r\nin support of his opinion, arguments of no great value, viz., that\r\nteeth after subluxation continue painful for a certain time, and that\r\nthey always remain in an oblique position. The method in question,\r\nwhich has the effect of breaking the dental nerve, is, in our opinion,\r\npractically equivalent to a replantation, or is, in point of fact, a\r\nreplantation, when the luxation of the tooth is complete. The arguments\r\nthat Bücking brings forward against it are futile; the first objection,\r\nfor the most part, does not subsist, and, in any case, the persistence\r\nof pain for a short time would be of small importance compared with the\r\ngreat advantage of preserving the tooth; as to the second, it is to be\r\nunderstood of itself that subluxation performed by means of the pelican\r\n(the instrument then used for the operation) would cause the tooth to\r\nassume an oblique position; but even supposing it did not straighten\r\nup of itself, there could not have been any difficulty for the good\r\ndentists of that period in forcing the tooth again into normal position\r\nand in maintaining it there. The weak side of the operation consisted\r\nrather in the fact of its being probably carried out without due\r\nconsideration of the dangers resulting from the possible alterations of\r\nthe dental pulp.\r\n\r\nAt the time of which we are writing many believed that the enamel\r\nof the teeth could be regenerated altogether or in part, and that,\r\ntherefore, it was of no great consequence that it should be worn\r\naway by the use of the file or of abrasive dentifrice powders. Thus,\r\nfor example, the renowned surgeon Theden expressly recommended such\r\npowders, as the best adapted for cleaning the teeth and for freeing\r\nthem from tartar.[517]\r\n\r\nVAN WY,[518] the Dutch surgeon, in 1784, related two cases of\r\nregeneration of the maxillary bones; other cases of the same kind were\r\nrelated some years later by Percy and Boulet.[519]\r\n\r\nCHOPART and DESAULT recommended, in cases of difficult dentition, the\r\nexcision of the gum in correspondence with the teeth that are to come\r\nout, rather than simple incisions.[520]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antonio Campani.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96\r\n\r\nPelican for extracting incisor, canine, and molar teeth (Campani,\r\n1786).]\r\n\r\nANTONIO CAMPANI, of Florence, published in 1786 a treatise on\r\ndentistry,[521] very elegantly printed, and illustrated with thirty-six\r\nplates very neatly carried out. This book, however, contains nothing of\r\nreal importance for the development of dentistry.\r\n\r\nBENJAMIN BELL, the English surgeon, a contemporary of Hunter, also\r\ndevoted much attention to diseases of the teeth, and, if it may be\r\nargued from the clear and precise manner in which he expresses his\r\nopinions on various questions relating to dental pathology and therapy,\r\nit would seem that he had much greater experience in this field than\r\nthe celebrated Hunter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97\r\n\r\nPelicans for extracting wisdom teeth (Campani).]\r\n\r\nWith regard to incision of the gums, in cases of difficult dentition,\r\nthis author contradicts certain assertions of the German surgeon\r\nIsenflamm (1782), who argued that when the tooth is already to be\r\nperceived through the gum, the incisions are altogether useless, while\r\nif the tooth be still at some depth, the gingival incision will soon\r\nclose again, so that the cicatrix will render the eruption of the\r\ntooth still more difficult. Bell admits, too, that lancing the gum is\r\naltogether superfluous when the tooth has pierced the tissue, all the\r\nmore so that the accidents provoked by the eruption are then generally\r\nalready passed and gone, but the operation ought, in his opinion, to\r\ntake place much earlier; and should the wound close again before the\r\ntooth has erupted, the gum must be lanced a second time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98\r\n\r\nCampani’s forceps: The first for molar teeth when loose or after having\r\nbeen shaken with the pelican; the second for deciduous teeth.]\r\n\r\nBell contradicts the opinion of Jourdain and Hunter that the morbid\r\ngatherings of Highmore’s antrum are generally consequent upon the\r\nclosing of the normal opening of the cavity in the middle meatus. In\r\nmany cases of disease of the maxillary sinus this orifice remains\r\nopen, the liquid therein collected discharging itself not unfrequently\r\nthrough it, in certain positions of the body. Instead of penetrating\r\ninto the antrum through the nasal orifice, as Jourdain would have\r\nit, Bell advises opening the cavity by Lamorier’s, or, better still,\r\nby Drake’s method. Except in special cases, the first or second molar\r\nought to be extracted, but preferably the second. After trepanning the\r\nalveolus and emptying the cavity, the opening should be closed with a\r\nconically shaped peg to prevent its slipping into the cavity. From time\r\nto time the liquid that tends to reaccumulate should be allowed exit,\r\nand detersive injections should be made, preferably of lime water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99\r\n\r\nTwo key instruments with changeable hooks (Campani).]\r\n\r\nLooseness of the teeth, which in old age may be considered a normal\r\ncondition, is always a disease when it occurs in youth. In certain\r\ncases its cause is unknown, in others it depends on an affection of the\r\ngums, either of a scorbutic nature or consequent on an accumulation of\r\ntartar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100\r\n\r\nAn instrument especially destined to extract loose bicuspid teeth. The\r\nscrew in the interior of the instrument allowed the hook to be brought\r\nto just the right point in each case (Campani).]\r\n\r\nAccording to Bell, dental caries is generally owing to a bad condition\r\nof the humors of the entire body and to a peculiar morbid disposition,\r\nrather than to external causes acting locally, although these latter\r\nmay contribute, together with the general causes, to the producing of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101\r\n\r\nCampani’s dental cauteries: The large ones for cases of post-extractive\r\nhemorrhage; the small ones for the cauterization of carious cavities.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nicholas Dubois Dechémant.]\r\n\r\nThis author was decidedly averse to the use of the file. For stopping\r\ncarious cavities he advises the use of mastic, gum lac, or wax,\r\nif the cavity is large and funnel-shaped; this stopping, however,\r\nrequires to be renewed frequently. But when the cavity, wider at the\r\nbottom, narrows toward the surface, one ought to use gold or, still\r\nbetter, tin-foil. The pulp ought always to be destroyed previously by\r\ncauterization.\r\n\r\nBell advises great caution in carrying out transplantation, it having\r\nbeen proved by many examples that contagious maladies of a serious\r\nnature may easily be communicated in this way from one individual to\r\nanother.[522]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a young woman who had an upper incisor transplanted,\r\nWATSON observed undoubted symptoms of syphilitic infection with\r\nsupervening accidents of exceptional gravity, which in spite of careful\r\ntreatment ended in death.[523]\r\n\r\nHunter also relates having observed, in seven cases of transplantation,\r\nvery serious accidents which, however, he did not believe to be owing\r\nto syphilis, although bearing a certain symptomatic resemblance to it.\r\nContrariwise, the well-known German surgeon Richter not only admitted\r\nthe possibility of transmitting syphilis through a transplanted tooth,\r\nbut even that the transplantation of an altogether healthy tooth from\r\nthe mouth of a person undoubtedly free from syphilis might be followed\r\nby serious accidents of a syphilitic nature, and this because the\r\npossible existence of a latent syphilis in the person to whose mouth\r\nthe tooth was transplanted cannot be excluded; in which case the\r\nabnormal stimulus exercised by the transplanted tooth might very well\r\ngive rise to syphilitic manifestations. Therefore, the fact that the\r\nperson who furnished the tooth was and continued to be in a state of\r\nperfect health (as precisely in the case cited by Watson) would not\r\nbe sufficient proof that the accidents ensuing on the transplantation\r\nmight not be of a syphilitic nature.\r\n\r\nLETTSON also observed, in certain cases of transplantation, accidents\r\nof more or less gravity which he held to be due to syphilis, calling,\r\nhowever, to mind a case cited by Kuhn, of Philadelphia, where the\r\npossibility of syphilis was not to be thought of, as the morbid\r\nsymptoms disappeared entirely, without any treatment, as soon as the\r\ntransplanted tooth was removed.[524]\r\n\r\nAUGUST G. RICHTER, the above-named German surgeon, in those portions\r\nof his work dedicated to dental affections and diseases of Highmore’s\r\nantrum, treated these subjects with admirable clearness and order,\r\nwithout contributing, however, anything original to the development of\r\ndental surgery.[525]\r\n\r\nNICHOLAS DUBOIS DE CHEMANT, in 1788, of whom we shall later have\r\noccasion to speak again, published in Paris his first pamphlet on\r\nmineral teeth, entitled _Sur les avantages des nouvelles dents, et\r\nrateliers artificiels, incorruptibles, sans odeur_.\r\n\r\nJEAN JACQUES JOSEPH SERRE (1759 to 1830). Among the dentists of the\r\nend of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth, a\r\nspecial mention is due to Jean Jacques Joseph Serre. He was born at\r\nMons, in Belgium, but his remarkable practical and scientific activity\r\nwas chiefly called into exercise in Vienna and in Berlin. He published\r\nseveral works, the most important of which is a practical treatise on\r\ndental operations.[526]\r\n\r\nAmong his minor works, one edited in Vienna, in 1788, treats of\r\ntoothache during pregnancy; another, printed in Leipsic in 1791, treats\r\nmost extensively of diseases of the gums; a third speaks of the mode of\r\nmaintaining the teeth and gums in good condition. This little book of\r\ndental hygiene, like the rest of Serre’s books, met with great favor,\r\nand went through two editions in a brief space of time (Berlin, 1809 to\r\n1812).\r\n\r\nThe works of this author show great study, very wide practice, and an\r\nadmirable spirit of observation and research. They had the merit of\r\ngreatly contributing to raise the level of dental culture in Germany,\r\nand one finds in them a pretty nearly complete account of the dentistry\r\nof that period. Apart from this, they possess a special interest\r\nbecause of the vast number of dates and important historical facts\r\ntherein contained.\r\n\r\nAs it would be useless here to enter into a minute analysis of the\r\ncontents of these books, we will limit ourselves to mentioning a few\r\nideas of which Serre was a strenuous supporter.\r\n\r\nHe combats an old prejudice that had recently been reinforced by the\r\nauthority of Jourdain, that is, that it does harm to extract a tooth\r\nwhen the soft parts around it are inflamed and swollen. He likewise\r\ncombats the prejudice, also of very ancient date, that teeth ought not\r\nto be extracted during pregnancy. Only, he considers it as well to\r\navoid the cauterization of the dental pulp in cases of gestation. In\r\nextracting teeth, the forceps ought only to be used after the tooth has\r\nbeen luxated by means of the pelican. Serre highly approves of this\r\ninstrument, although he recognizes it to be a dangerous one in the\r\nhands of those who do not know how to make a proper use of it. This\r\nauthor invented or perfected various extracting instruments, among\r\nwhich a conical screw for extraction of roots hollowed out by caries\r\ndeserves particular mention, and which, under a somewhat modified form,\r\nis still in use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jean Jacques Joseph Serre.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting chapters of Serre’s great work is the one\r\nin which he treats of affections of Highmore’s cavity.[527] He speaks\r\nat length of the anatomy of the maxillary sinus, of its relation to the\r\nteeth situated below it, of the various modes in which the diseases\r\nof the antrum are produced, of their symptoms and treatment. He passes\r\nin review the various operative methods, and finds that in general the\r\nCowper-Drake is the one to be preferred to all the others. He says\r\nthat to open the sinus the simple extraction of a molar suffices in\r\nthe greater number of cases, the trepanning of the alveolus not being\r\ngenerally necessary.\r\n\r\nJ. ARNEMAN, in 1766, published at Göttingen a synopsis of surgical\r\ninstruments[528] that deserves mention in so far that the dental\r\ninstruments of that time as well as those of earlier periods are\r\ntherein taken into account with sufficient exactness.\r\n\r\nA. F. HECKER attributed the accidents of difficult dentition to a\r\nspecial alteration of the saliva caused by the irritation deriving\r\nfrom the erupting teeth. In these cases the saliva is supposed by him\r\nto acquire a high degree of acridness and to become almost similar to\r\nthe poison of rabies. Departing from this theory, the author declares\r\nit to be necessary to mitigate the irritation produced on the gums\r\nand other parts of the mouth by the altered condition of the saliva,\r\nas well as to modify the quality of the saliva itself and to promote\r\nthe elimination of the same from the body by emetics and aperients.\r\nAccording to him, liquid carbonate of potash administered in drops,\r\ntogether with syrup of poppy heads, manna, etc., is a most useful\r\nremedy, having specially for its effect to diminish the acridness of\r\nthe saliva.\r\n\r\nBesides this remedy, the author extols the use of blisters behind the\r\nears, as also of tepid baths, which calm pain and spasms, favor the\r\nexcretions, and procure repose and sleep. He rejects the incision of\r\nthe gums as altogether useless, and is most opposed to the use of\r\nopium, which he states renders children liable to apoplexy.\r\n\r\nAnd here we will mention, rather by way of curiosity than for any real\r\nhistorical interest which they possess, two pamphlets on _odontitis_,\r\npublished respectively in 1791 and 1794 by Ploucquet and Kappis, who\r\nmaintained that not only the dental pulp, but all the parts that form\r\nthe tooth are susceptible of inflammation.[529] In Kappis’ pamphlet\r\nwe find the following ideas developed, upon which we do not think\r\nnecessary to comment. The inflammatory process consists essentially\r\nin the increased flow of humors to a given part and in a more or less\r\nintense reaction of the vital force. Both of these things may take\r\nplace in the teeth. These are liable to swell, that is, to undergo\r\nan increase of all their dimensions, in proof of which assertion the\r\nauthor relates the case of an individual, who when attacked by a\r\nviolent toothache had found the spaces between his teeth so narrowed\r\nthat it was no longer possible to make use of his usual toothpick,\r\neven if he had tried to do so regardless of pain. But when the\r\ntoothache was over, the same toothpick again became serviceable as\r\nbefore. He says that there is no cause for wonder that in odontitis no\r\nredness of the teeth is to be perceived, for in other inflammations\r\nas well, redness is wanting, and, moreover, it exists in the interior\r\nmembrane of the tooth. As in other inflammations, so also in odontitis,\r\nthe usual issue is resolution. Dental fistulæ may derive from internal\r\nsuppuration. The impurities deposited on the teeth are by him supposed\r\nto be owing to an increase of their secretion! According to the author,\r\ncaries, the breaking down of teeth apparently healthy, as well as\r\ntheir falling out, is generally caused by an inflammation of these\r\norgans, that is, by odontitis, an affection that, he says, may be of\r\nvery varied kind, the principal forms being the rheumatic, arthritic,\r\nsympathetic, and gastric.\r\n\r\nRANIERI GERBI.[530] In a book by this author we find recommended a\r\nvery singular cure for toothache, even of the most violent nature. It\r\nis in no way scientific, and is besides not particularly pleasant,\r\nnotwithstanding that the author, professor at the University of Pisa,\r\nwas a scientist of merit, enjoying special esteem as a mathematician\r\nand cultivator of natural sciences.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _curculio anti-odontalgicus_ he describes an insect\r\nliving habitually inside the flowers of the _carduus spinosissimus_,\r\nthat could be used with great advantage against toothache, in the\r\nfollowing manner: One crushes fourteen or fifteen larvæ of the insect\r\nbetween the thumb and forefinger, and then rubs the two fingers\r\ntogether until the matter remaining upon them is entirely absorbed.\r\nInstead of the larvæ (which, as is known, represent the first stage\r\nof insect life) one may also use the fully developed insects. One\r\nthen applies the two fingers that have crushed the insects or their\r\nlarvæ upon the decayed and aching tooth. If the pain is of a nature\r\nto be cured by this means, it diminishes almost instantaneously,\r\nand ceases altogether in a few minutes. It is said that the fingers\r\npreserve their healing power for a great length of time, even a whole\r\nyear, and in proof of these assertions Ranieri Gerbi speaks of no\r\nless than six hundred cures performed! Other insects besides the\r\n_curculio anti-odontalgicus_, used in the same manner, are said to\r\npossess the same curative properties, among them the _curculio jaceæ_,\r\n_carabus chrysocephalus_, and the _curculio Bacchus_, which last,\r\nsays Gerbi, has long been used for this purpose by the peasants of\r\nTuscany. The author also says that some German doctors and naturalists\r\nexperimented with success with several insects indigenous to Germany\r\nas remedies against toothache. These insects, also mentioned in a\r\nwork published in Bayreuth in 1796, author unknown, are:[531] the\r\n_coccinella septempunctata_, the _coccinella bipunctata_, the _carabus\r\nferrugineus_, the _chrysomela sanguinolenta_, the _chrysomela populi_,\r\nthe cantharis or Spanish fly, and others. Later on, Hirsch also\r\nextolled the healing power of another insect, the _cynips rosarum_.\r\nWith regard to the mode of application, Gerbi says that instead of\r\ncrushing and rubbing these insects or their larvæ between the fingers,\r\none can use a piece of wash leather in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, however, that the insects that are found\r\ngenerally in the ripe wild teasle—or more precisely their larvæ—had\r\nalready been used for a long time as a remedy against toothache;\r\nindeed, we even find these means of cure recommended in the natural\r\nhistory of Pliny. In a book entitled _Histoire d’un voyage aux îles\r\nMalouines fait en 1763 et 1764_, by a certain Dom Pernetty, this\r\nauthor speaks of some remedies made known to him by the Superior of\r\nthe Franciscan friars of Montevideo; and among others one finds the\r\nfollowing: “One draws out the worm that is generally found in the head\r\nof the fuller’s teasle when this is ripe. One rolls this worm between\r\nthe index finger and the thumb, lightly pressing it until it dies\r\nof languor. The one or the other of the two fingers applied on the\r\naching tooth will have the virtue, for a year at least, of making the\r\ntoothache cease.”[532]\r\n\r\nHEINRICH CALLISEN, in an excellent treatise on surgery[533] published\r\nat Copenhagen in 1788, writes at sufficient length and with great\r\naccuracy on dental and maxillary diseases. According to this writer,\r\nit rarely suffices to trepan one alveolus for the treatment of the\r\nmorbid collections of Highmore’s antrum, as the maxillary sinus is\r\nvery often divided by partitions into various cells, so that in order\r\nto give exit to the pus contained in each of them, it is necessary to\r\nextract several teeth and trepan their alveoli.[534] One ought not,\r\ntherefore, to give the preference to this method, unless in the case of\r\nthe teeth in question being decayed. But should they all be in a good\r\nstate, or should a large opening be necessary because of the nature\r\nof the disease in the cavity, it will be better to follow Lamorier’s\r\nmethod, that is, to incise the gum crosswise under the malar process\r\nand then, after scraping away the periosteum, trepan the bone. Further,\r\nin the case of the disease in the maxillary sinus having given rise to\r\ntumefaction, softening of the bone, and fluctuation in the palatine\r\nregion, it is precisely there that the perforation ought to be carried\r\nout. To prevent the reclosing of the opening before the cure is\r\ncompleted, the author advises the use of pledgets, small bougies, a\r\npiece of prepared sponge, or even a small tube. According to Callisen,\r\nthe injections through the nasal orifice of the maxillary sinus are\r\npartly impracticable, and partly of no utility.\r\n\r\nIt always does more harm than good to file or to scrape the decayed\r\npart of a tooth, without stopping it afterward, as by thus doing, says\r\nthe author, one only renders it still more liable to the access and\r\nthe action of harmful external influences. In preparing the cavity\r\nfor stopping, the bottom of it should be more ample than its external\r\naperture, that the filling may remain firm.\r\n\r\nFor extracting molars, he makes use either of the pelican or of the\r\nkey; for the incisors and the canines, of the forceps; and for roots,\r\nof the goat’s foot.\r\n\r\nCallisen treats incipient _idiopathic_ epulis by destroying it through\r\ncauterization, after having covered the teeth with wax; if the epulis\r\nbe large and more or less hard, he removes it with the bistoury; as to\r\n_symptomatic_ epulis, he holds the removal of the original cause to be\r\nthe best mode of treatment.\r\n\r\nThis author declares himself decidedly in favor of replantation and\r\ntransplantation, expressing the idea that these methods are always\r\nto be preferred to the application of artificial teeth. He maintains\r\nthat after a tooth has been replanted, and its consolidation has taken\r\nplace, there is no possibility of any further pain, the nerve being\r\nbroken. The author relates a brilliant cure which he carried out upon\r\na lieutenant, who, during the siege of Copenhagen, had received a blow\r\nthat had sent all his front teeth into his mouth. Callisen immediately\r\nput them all back in their places with such ability that they became\r\nperfectly firm again. With reference to transplantation, he only\r\nbelieves in its being possible for teeth with a single root.\r\n\r\nIn works published toward 1790, Lentin and Conradi, devoted their\r\nparticular attention to the morbid conditions that produce looseness\r\nand spontaneous falling of the teeth. For the treatment of these\r\nconditions Conradi recommended general and local remedies. The general\r\nremedies were directed to the suppressing of acridness in the blood,\r\nwhich he considered to be an etiological element of primary importance.\r\nAs to the local remedies, they ought specially to consist in keeping\r\nthe teeth clean by the use of a toothbrush, in painting the gums with\r\ntincture of catechu and myrrh, and in rinsing the mouth frequently with\r\na decoction of cinchona or of willow bark. Against toothache caused by\r\ncaries, he particularly advises essence of cloves, introduced into the\r\ncarious cavity on a piece of cotton-wool.[535]\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH HIRSCH was much less disposed than were many of the preceding\r\nwriters to incision of the gums in cases of difficult dentition.\r\nAgainst the accidents connected with this morbid condition, he\r\nprefers, in general, the use of gentle aperients or of emetics, and\r\nregards the scarification of the gums as opportune only in cases\r\nwhere symptoms indicating a high degree of nervous tension manifest\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nAgainst incipient caries, Hirsch used simple cauterization, which\r\nhe held to be capable of arresting the morbid process, at least in\r\nmany cases. He says, however, that when a real carious cavity exists,\r\nit is absolutely necessary to stop it; and for this purpose, rather\r\nthan metallic or resinous fillings, he prefers a cement of turpentine\r\nand quicklime, made into a paste with varnish of oil of linseed.\r\nNevertheless, when it is a case of the lower teeth, tin-foil is also,\r\naccording to him, an excellent filling material.\r\n\r\nLike some of the preceding authors, Hirsch admitted the existence of\r\n_interior caries_ in apparently healthy teeth, and was the first to\r\nindicate a good mode of diagnosticating these occult dental affections.\r\nIt consists in tapping the suspected teeth with a sound until one finds\r\nthe one in which the percussion provokes pain, and this will be the\r\ndiseased tooth. One detaches the gum from the neck of this tooth, and\r\nat the point, on the neck itself or on the beginning of the root, where\r\na small protrusion is found, one perforates the tooth with a chisel,\r\nor some other fit instrument, so as to penetrate to the interior of\r\nit. Through this passage one introduces into the tooth a fine, curved,\r\nred-hot sound, repeating the operation several times. Lastly, one fills\r\nthe cavity with lead; and in this manner the tooth will be cured and no\r\nlonger painful.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the correction of dental anomalies, Hirsch relates a\r\ncase in which the deformity consisted in the union of two central\r\nincisors, which formed one single piece, resembling a paddle, and\r\nspoiled the appearance of the face. He divided them with a saw,\r\ncauterized the surfaces of the section, scarified the gum, and, to\r\ngain a little space, introduced a small wedge, until the gum had grown\r\nup within the new dental interstice, thus giving an altogether normal\r\nappearance to the part.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that Hirsch made use almost exclusively of the goat’s\r\nfoot for the extraction of teeth, of whatever kind they might be, the\r\ninstrument being rather longer, however, than that ordinarily known by\r\nthis name, and making his left hand serve as a lever rest.\r\n\r\nTo arrest strong hemorrhage ensuing from the extraction of teeth,\r\nHirsch used scraped parchment, which he introduced into the alveolus\r\nand pressed with force into it by means of a sound; then he superposed\r\ncompresses and kept the jaws tight together with a bandage passed\r\naround the head.\r\n\r\nThis author, too, was very favorable to replantation. As to\r\ntransplantation, he says that even when the gum and the alveolus are\r\nquite healthy, the individual entirely free from scurvy and syphilis,\r\nand not above fifty years of age, the transplanted teeth do not take\r\nroot perfectly except in an average of one case in three. For carrying\r\nout this operation he never made use of teeth extracted from the mouth\r\nof a living person, but, on the contrary, he used the teeth of young\r\nand healthy subjects who had died a violent death; these were, besides,\r\ncarefully cleaned before transplanting them, and in this way the author\r\nbelieved the transmission of disease to be nearly impossible.[536]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102\r\n\r\nFull lower set in hippopotamus ivory, with human front teeth;\r\nseventeenth century. (From Guerini’s collection.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103\r\n\r\nUpper denture in ivory, at the end of the eighteenth century, for a\r\ncase in which the last molars and the front teeth were present. (From\r\nGuerini’s collection.)]\r\n\r\nJ. E. WICHMANN combated energetically the practice, then pretty\r\ngeneral, of endeavoring to facilitate the eruption of the teeth\r\nby incision of the gums. He considered this practice as one to be\r\nabsolutely rejected, supporting his opinion on the consideration that\r\ndentition, being an altogether physiological process, which, moreover,\r\ntakes place in parts relatively of but little importance, never can\r\ngive rise of itself alone to serious accidents. Besides this, he says,\r\nit is very difficult to say which tooth precisely is about to erupt\r\nand at what point. The incisions would, therefore, have to be made\r\nby chance, which would often render the morbid condition still more\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nK. A. BLUMENTHAL endeavored to confute Wichmann’s opinions, with but\r\nlittle success; for, indeed, the same opinions, expressed later by J.\r\nH. Sternberg in a more detailed manner and with ampler views of the\r\nsubject, met with ever-increasing approval. Thenceforth, the practice\r\nof gingival incisions in cases of difficult dentition fell more and\r\nmore into discredit.[537]\r\n\r\nROBERT BUNON,[538] the French dentist, is one of the most illustrious\r\npersonalities to be met with in the history of our profession. He was\r\nborn at the beginning of the eighteenth century, and devoted himself\r\nbetimes to the dental art, gathering instruction therein partly from\r\ndifferent dentists and partly from the few odontological books he\r\nwas able to find. In this manner he learned pretty much all that was\r\nknown at that time by dentists in general. He then decided to travel,\r\nin order to acquire further knowledge and experience. He practised\r\nespecially in the north of France and in what is now the state of\r\nBelgium; at Antwerp, Brussels, Givet, Maubeuge, Cambrai. In his ardent\r\nthirst for knowledge, when he happened to pass through a town where\r\nsome dentist of note resided, he never neglected to call on him, thus\r\nacquiring fresh information and perfecting himself as well in the\r\npractical exercise of his profession. At the same time, his desire to\r\nlearn all that was new concerning dental art and science was so intense\r\nthat he had translations made of the medical and surgical works of\r\nLatin, Italian, German, and English authors. However, all this reading,\r\nalthough it enlarged his general knowledge, taught him nothing, or\r\nalmost nothing, about those subjects that interested him above all the\r\nothers. His practical experiences, meanwhile, brought a great number of\r\npatients to his notice, and, being by nature a very acute observer, he\r\nwas able to establish the existence of many facts up to then unknown.\r\nAt this time he commenced his studies on dental erosion, on the\r\ndevelopment of the teeth, and on the prophylaxis of dental maladies,\r\nhis favorite subject. “I felt,” he writes, “that the necessity of\r\nhaving recourse day by day to the extraction of teeth resulted from\r\ndeficient knowledge on our part, and I considered this extreme remedy\r\nas one of the greatest evils to humanity.”[539] He therefore endeavored\r\nto extend his own knowledge in every possible way, and as one means\r\nof doing this he visited hospitals and schools; and, ardent champion\r\nas he was of conservative dentistry and of prophylaxis, he succeeded\r\nin interesting medical men and surgeons, midwives and schoolmasters,\r\nand parish priests as well, in the question of the preservation of\r\nthe teeth. The teeth he extracted he kept for the purpose of studying\r\nthe conformation, the lesions, the dental anomalies; sometimes he\r\nsplit them up to examine the dental pulp. And he never neglected an\r\nopportunity of procuring anatomical pieces that appeared interesting to\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn 1728 Fauchard’s book, _Le Chirurgien Dentiste_, appeared. The fame\r\nof this work reached Belgium, where Bunon then was, and he immediately\r\nset about trying to get a copy of it. After searching in various towns,\r\nhe finally found one in Givet. He read it with the greatest interest,\r\nand later, in one of his works, spoke of it in terms of highest praise.\r\nIt would seem, however, that he did not learn much that was new to\r\nhim by reading this book, which proves that he already possessed a\r\nvast odontological culture and was also profoundly versed in technical\r\ndentistry, which forms the most important part of Fauchard’s book. He\r\nwas somewhat astonished at finding in this celebrated author’s work\r\nhardly anything on the subjects that principally interested him, that\r\nis, the erosion, the development of the teeth, and the prophylaxis of\r\ncaries. This circumstance very clearly reveals the different mental\r\ntendencies in these two great men, the one, drawn toward the practical\r\nside of the profession which principally interests him and forms the\r\nbasis of his work, the other, an impassioned searcher into causes, and\r\nstudent of prophylaxis.\r\n\r\nAfter the perusal of Fauchard’s book, Bunon, who had already conceived\r\nthe idea of publishing the results of his observations and of his own\r\nparticular studies, felt more than ever the propriety and necessity\r\nof doing so; and to realize his idea, he established himself toward\r\nthe year 1735 at Paris. Two years later, just when the manuscript of\r\nhis work was almost finished, Gerauldy’s book appeared. Bunon relates\r\nthat he opened this book in fear and trembling; its title, _The art of\r\npreserving the teeth_, gave him reason to fear that Gerauldy might have\r\nprofited by some of the ideas and observations he had communicated to\r\nvarious persons, to write a book similar to the one that he himself had\r\nit in his mind to publish.[540] He was able, fortunately, to convince\r\nhimself immediately that his fears of being forestalled and plagiarized\r\nwere unfounded.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, Bunon was determined not to publish his book until the\r\nopportune moment and with all possible probability of success. With\r\nthis object in view, he made up his mind first to obtain the diploma\r\nof surgeon-dentist. To reach this aim, he was obliged to conform to\r\nthe regulations of the _Edict of May_, 1699, which then regulated\r\nthe practising of dentistry, and this was as much as to say that he\r\nwas obliged to enter the College of Surgery, to undertake two years’\r\npractice with a regularly licensed surgeon, to undergo theoretical\r\nand practical examinations, and to take oath before the Chief Surgeon\r\nof the Realm. Once in possession of the diploma of surgeon-dentist,\r\nhe was separated thenceforward from the vulgar crowd of charlatans\r\nand invested with all the prestige which a degree, so rarely acquired\r\nat that time, conferred upon its possessor; but before facing public\r\nopinion he desired to make himself known, and, so to say, first to\r\ntry his ground, by making known some of his newer ideas, and see what\r\nreception they might meet with from his colleagues and the public in\r\ngeneral. He, therefore, published, in January, 1741, in the newspaper\r\n_Mercure de France_, a letter on the so-called _eye tooth_,[541]\r\ncombating the then widely diffused prejudice that the extraction of an\r\nupper canine constituted a grave peril to the eye. He demonstrated the\r\nabsurdity of this idea by putting in evidence the anatomical fact that\r\nthe upper canines are innervated by the infra-orbital nerve, which has\r\nno relation whatever with the visual organ.\r\n\r\nStill better to further his object of making himself a name, he\r\npublished in the same year and in the aforementioned paper his\r\ndissertation on the teeth of pregnant women.[542] There he demonstrated\r\nthe falseness of the idea that one ought never to extract teeth during\r\nthe state of gestation, and brought into relief the necessity of\r\ntreating the dental diseases of pregnant women with still more accuracy\r\nthan those of other persons.\r\n\r\nThese publications, bearing as they did the marks of good sense,\r\nfavorably interested the public opinion. The way was therefore\r\nprepared, and Bunon judging the moment to have come for publishing\r\nhis work, placed it in the hands of a literary man for the necessary\r\ncorrections of style. He also showed his manuscript to several persons\r\nof consideration, but was grieved to perceive that the new ideas put\r\nforward in it were skeptically received. He now thought it might be as\r\nwell to appeal to the judgment of a highly competent authority, and\r\nfixed on M. de la Peyronie, Head Surgeon of the Realm. This gentleman,\r\nafter reading the work, highly praised the author, and Bunon gained\r\npermission to publish the book under his patronage, on consideration\r\nthat he should give his word to furnish the proof of the many\r\nassertions made therein on all kinds of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe goal was now reached, and Bunon, on the strength of such\r\nillustrious patronage, published his book in March of 1743, under the\r\ntitle, _Essay on the maladies of the teeth, wherein are suggested the\r\nmeans of obtaining their good conformation from the earliest age, and\r\nof assuring their preservation during the whole course of life_.[543]\r\n\r\nAll the principal journals of the time (_Journal des Savants_, _Journal\r\nde Trévoux_, _Journal de Verdun_, _Mercure de France_, etc.) published\r\nextracts from the book and eulogized the author, who had even the high\r\nsatisfaction of receiving an honorable mention from the Royal Academy\r\nof Surgery, in the public sitting held in 1743.\r\n\r\nBunon, therefore, was now famous, and had, besides, gained wealthy\r\nclients, as we see from the perusal of his observations, where the best\r\nnames in France are to be met with, put in evidence by him without\r\nthe least thought of professional secrecy. He could now enjoy his\r\nwell-merited successes, in accordance with the thought expressed by him\r\nin one of his books: “All those who labor for the progress of an art\r\nhave legitimate right to the honor and to all the recompenses to which\r\nsuccess is entitled.”[544]\r\n\r\nThe study of Bunon’s work proves, in fact, that he had good right to\r\nbe proud of having written it. The mere perusal of it, however, does\r\nnot suffice to enable the reader to judge of its merits, for to do this\r\nproperly, it is necessary to study at the same time his other book,\r\npublished in 1746, entitled _Experiences and demonstrations made at the\r\nHospital of Salpêtrière and at St. Côme, before the Royal Academy of\r\nSurgery, serving as continuation and proof to the Essay on the maladies\r\nof the teeth_.[545] The essay is, in fact, a small 12mo book of 212\r\npages, written in a concise style, and, strange to say, most concise in\r\nthe most important points.\r\n\r\nMany facts of great moment are given under the form of rapid\r\nindications, or of assertions without proof; thus their importance is\r\napt to pass completely unobserved by those who do not take the trouble\r\nof studying this work thoroughly and with the help of the explanations,\r\nillustrations, and comments contained in the second book we have\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\nM. A. Barden, of the École Odontotechnique of Paris, was the first\r\nto undertake a serious and conscientious study of Bunon’s works. By\r\nso doing he has thrown full light on the author’s great merits, and\r\nbrought forward the high scientific importance of his works.\r\n\r\nOne of the important questions studied by Bunon concerns the hygiene\r\nto be observed in order to obtain the development of a good dentition.\r\nOn this question he rightly establishes the principle that hygiene and\r\ndental prophylaxis should begin from the period of the formation of\r\nthe milk teeth. He works out this principle with rigorous logic, and\r\nfinishes by tracing the hygiene of the mother during pregnancy, of the\r\nwoman (be she mother or nurse) during the nursing period, and of the\r\nnursling as well.\r\n\r\nAs to the accidents of first dentition, Bunon sets forth a highly\r\nscientific opinion, fully coinciding with the ideas of modern writers,\r\nthat is, that dentition is not the sole cause, nor even the principal\r\ncause, of such accidents, but simply a coöperating cause. He made the\r\nobservation that in healthy infants, children of healthy parents and\r\nnursed by healthy women, the time of teething is gotten over without\r\ndifficulty, while serious accidents occur frequently in weak and sickly\r\nchildren not brought up and nourished according to hygienic principles,\r\nor born, as not often happens, with special hereditary predispositions.\r\n\r\nOne of Bunon’s merits is that of having attributed to the first\r\nteeth all the importance they really have, and of having insisted\r\non the necessity of attentively curing their maladies. He also drew\r\nattention to the dangers that may result from the eventual persistence\r\nof the first teeth at the epoch of the second dentition, or from the\r\npersistence of their roots after the destruction of the crown by\r\ncaries. These roots, he says, by their contact with the neighboring\r\npermanent teeth may infect them, and cause them to decay.\r\n\r\nBunon’s researches into the development of the teeth enabled him to\r\ndescribe precisely the position that the various teeth of the second\r\ndentition occupy in the jaw with regard to the milk teeth, before these\r\nare shed.\r\n\r\nBunon was, besides, the first author who studied accurately dental\r\nhypoplasia, and it is greatly to his honor that his ideas and\r\nobservations about this pathological condition have been accepted and\r\nconfirmed in substance by the greater part of the authors who have come\r\nafter him, having remarkable worth even at the present day. According\r\nto him, this congenital defect of the teeth is owing to infantile\r\nmaladies, such as hereditary syphilis, infantile scurvy, malignant\r\nfevers, smallpox, or measles; the harmful effects of these maladies,\r\nhowever, are limited to the teeth in progress of development, and have\r\nno influence on those that have already come forth. Erosion, as this\r\ndefect was termed by Bunon, sometimes affects the first teeth, but is\r\nto be found much more frequently in the second or permanent ones. Those\r\nmost often affected are the first molars, and in frequency follow the\r\nincisors, the canines, the premolars; the second and third molars are\r\nthe most rarely affected.\r\n\r\nBunon studied with great accuracy the means of preventing anomalous\r\npositions of the permanent teeth, owing, according to him, almost\r\nalways to want of space. In certain cases he advises the extraction of\r\nthe milk tooth in order to facilitate the eruption of the permanent\r\none, and, necessity urging, he does not hesitate to sacrifice one of\r\nthe permanent teeth to procure the advantage of a normal position of\r\nthe others. With regard to this subject, the following passage is\r\nworthy of note, for in it we find sketched out the theory of preventive\r\nextraction as a means of facilitating the eruption of the wisdom tooth:\r\n“It is better to have the teeth incomplete as to number than to have\r\nthe ordinary number badly arranged; for the mouth will appear none the\r\nless well furnished because of having one or two teeth the less; the\r\nother teeth will be commodiously distributed, and the last molars will\r\nfind sufficient room when they come forth; thus, the disorders which\r\nthese teeth often occasion will be avoided.”[546]\r\n\r\nAfter caries, Bunon considers dental tartar as the most potent enemy to\r\nthe vitality of the teeth. He distinguishes three principal species:\r\nthe black, the lemon or light yellow, and the brownish yellow; however,\r\nhe allows of two other varieties of less frequent occurrence, the red\r\nand the green tartar.\r\n\r\nAt a period when an extraordinary confusion obtained with regard to\r\ngingivitis, because of the great number of varieties allowed, Bunon\r\nstrongly affirms the unity of this morbid process, and considers tartar\r\nas the constant cause of it, without denying, however, that other\r\ncauses of various kinds may contribute at the same time to produce it.\r\n\r\nIn cases of scorbutic stomatitis, Bunon advises, and very rightly, the\r\ncomplete removal of tartar from the teeth before having recourse to any\r\nother local treatment. He also insists on the necessity of attending to\r\nthe teeth and gums, and especially of freeing the former from tartar\r\nbefore undertaking the specific treatment of syphilis, considering\r\nthe good state of the teeth and gums as one of the most important\r\nprophylactic measures against mercurial stomatitis.\r\n\r\nAnyone who takes the trouble of reading Bunon’s works attentively\r\ncannot help admiring his depth of insight, his spirit of observation,\r\nhis exquisite clinical sense, and his ingenuity. As illustrating this\r\nlast quality of his, we may cite two cases of fracture of the lower jaw\r\nthat he succeeded in curing in a short time by the method of binding\r\nthe teeth, the preceding attempts of experienced surgeons having\r\nentirely failed. One of these cases is particularly interesting. The\r\nseat of the fracture corresponded with the bicuspids, which, however,\r\nhad fallen out from the effects of trauma; the neighboring teeth were\r\nalso loosened. Bunon filled the empty space left by the bicuspids\r\nwith a piece of ivory, provided with two holes; then, by an\r\ningenious crossing of threads passing from the second molar on the\r\none side to the second bicuspid on the other, very tightly tied, he\r\nformed, so to speak, one single block, and succeeded in bringing about\r\nthe consolidation of the shaking teeth and the complete cure of the\r\nfracture, which was effected in less than a month.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUSPINI WITH HIS FAMILY IN A COUNTRY PLACE\r\n\r\n_From an old painting in oil._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _The Italian dentist Ruspini presenting the children of\r\nhis orphanage to the members of the Free Masons Hall in London with\r\nwhose aid the institution had been founded._]\r\n\r\nThe unfavorable judgments passed on Bunon by some writers result, in a\r\ngreat measure, from the circumstance that one finds quoted in his books\r\ncertain modes of treatment that today appear positively ridiculous.\r\nBut those who, very wrongly and with deplorable levity, consider Bunon\r\nas nothing more than a vulgar empiric, ought to reflect that even the\r\ngreatest men cannot altogether avoid the influence of the ideas and the\r\nprejudices of their time. Some tribute they are almost fatally bound\r\nto pay to these prejudices. It is, therefore, not to be wondered at,\r\nif one finds in Bunon’s works, as well as in those of many other old\r\nwriters, indications given of more or less strange remedies. Thus, as\r\nfacilitating the eruption of teeth, he recommends among other remedies\r\nthe rubbing of the gums with a mixture of honey, fresh butter, hare’s\r\nbrains, and oil of lilies, or with the fat of an old cock, dog’s milk,\r\nand pig’s brains. Against the disorders and dangers of the teething\r\nperiod he also advises rubbing the nape of the infant’s neck, the\r\nshoulders, the back, and the lower limbs, always taking care, however,\r\nto rub from above downward, thus offering opposition to the flow of\r\nhumors toward the upper parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThese means and methods of treatment reflect, so to speak, the medical\r\nideas and the curative practices of that time, and come down, in part,\r\nfrom remote ages, as evidently appears from what is said in different\r\nparts of this book. But such small blemishes ought certainly not\r\nto be taken into account in passing judgment on Bunon’s works, the\r\nmost substantial part of which is made up of very original ideas and\r\nobservations. The high intrinsic value of Bunon’s works gives him a\r\njust right to be considered one of the most illustrious forerunners of\r\nmodern scientific dentistry.\r\n\r\nBARTOLOMEO RUSPINI, an Italian dentist, exercised his profession in\r\nLondon with great success for more than thirty years. He was patronized\r\nby all the greatest personages of the Kingdom and also by the Royal\r\nfamily, from whom he received special marks of distinction. He attained\r\na very conspicuous position, and with the aid of the London Freemasons’\r\nLodge, of which he was an influential member, but chiefly by the\r\nresults of his professional work, he was able to found an orphanage\r\nthat was called by his name, being moved to do this by his great love\r\nfor children, whose dental maladies and disorders had always been an\r\nobject of particular study for him. In 1768 he published _A Treatise\r\non the Teeth, Their Structure and Various Diseases_. This book was\r\nremarkably well received and went through a number of editions, the\r\nlast in the year 1797. Ruspini did not, in reality, contribute very\r\nmuch to the development of dental science. He is, however, to be\r\nespecially remembered as the inventor of a very good mouth mirror, a\r\nmeans of examination which afterward gradually came into general use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHaving brought our history of dentistry up to the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, in order to complete our work we must now speak of an\r\ninnovation in dental prosthesis, which, although gradually brought to\r\nperfection in the following century, was first introduced at that time.\r\nWe allude to the\r\n\r\n\r\nINVENTION OF MINERAL TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe merit of this invention is due, in part, to an individual outside\r\nthe dental profession, namely, to the French chemist Duchâteau, of\r\nSt. Germain en Laye, near Paris, who first had the idea of employing\r\nporcelain as material for dental prosthesis. However, his idea would\r\nnot have yielded fruitful results had it not been for the coöperation\r\nof the dentist Dubois de Chemant, who succeeded in putting it into\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances connected with this invention were the following:\r\nThe chemist Duchâteau had for some time worn a denture of hippopotamus\r\nivory, but as usually happened with all the prosthetic pieces of that\r\ntime, which were made of organic material, and were, therefore, subject\r\nto decay, this denture had acquired a very disagreeable odor, resulting\r\nfrom the action of the buccal humors. Besides which, Duchâteau being\r\nobliged, by reason of his profession, to continually taste pharmaceutic\r\npreparations, his denture had gradually become impregnated with\r\nmedicinal substances that imparted a nauseous taste to everything he\r\nate. The unpleasantness of this was a subject of much consideration\r\nwith him, and thus it was that, to remedy the evil, he gradually\r\nmatured the idea of having a porcelain denture made, on the model of\r\nthe ivory one. In the year 1774 he applied to the porcelain manufactory\r\nof M. Guerhard in Paris for the carrying out of his design. The first\r\ntrial was not successful, for in the baking the paste contracted so\r\nmuch that the denture was no longer of the right dimensions. To remedy\r\nthis, he now had another and larger denture made, to allow for its\r\ncontraction in the baking. But the results did not correspond with\r\nhis wishes, and many trials were still necessary before Duchâteau\r\nwas able to obtain a denture which he judged fit for use, although\r\nnot without defects. As this denture, because of its dead whiteness,\r\nproduced an unpleasant effect, he had a yellowish tint, resembling that\r\nof the natural teeth, given to it, and, as is usual with painting on\r\nporcelain, fixed this color by baking a second time.\r\n\r\nHowever, this denture proving unserviceable, Duchâteau was obliged to\r\nput it aside and begin new experiments. These were made with a special\r\nkind of porcelain paste used in France for the first time in 1740,\r\nwhich vitrified in baking at 12° to 25° by Wedgwood’s pyrometer, whilst\r\nthe usual porcelain required a temperature of 72° to 75° by the same\r\ntest; but the results thus obtained were no better than the preceding\r\nones, and upon these new failures Duchâteau applied to the dentist\r\nDubois de Chemant, of Paris, for his collaboration. Together they made\r\nfresh attempts, modifying the composition of the paste by adding a\r\ncertain quantity of pipe clay and other coloring earths to it. These\r\nmodifications enabled them to carry out the baking of the pieces at a\r\nmuch lower temperature, and after various experiments the final result\r\nwas a denture that fitted the gums well enough, and which, in point of\r\nfact, Duchâteau was able to wear.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success, he tried to manufacture like dentures for\r\npersonages of high rank, hoping to gain money thereby, but his want\r\nof knowledge of the dental art prevented him from succeeding in his\r\nundertaking. However, in 1776 he laid this new process before the Royal\r\nAcademy of Surgeons in Paris, receiving the thanks of that body as well\r\nas an honorable mention.\r\n\r\nWhilst Duchâteau, discouraged by failure, was giving up all idea of\r\nderiving profit from the practical application of his invention, Dubois\r\nde Chemant, on the contrary, did not cease working for a moment, in\r\norder to bring the new method of prosthesis to perfection. Little by\r\nlittle he introduced important modifications into the composition\r\nof the mineral paste used in the manufacture of the dentures,\r\nincorporating therewith Fontainebleau sand, alicant soda, marl, red\r\noxide of iron, and cobalt. His experiments and researches aimed at\r\nthree principal ends, viz.:\r\n\r\n1. The obtaining of mineral teeth offering all the gradations of color\r\npresented by natural ones.\r\n\r\n2. The arriving at a rigorous calculation of the contraction of the\r\nmineral paste in the baking, so as to be able to make prosthetic pieces\r\nof the desired form and dimensions.\r\n\r\n3. The perfecting of the means of attachment of the prosthetic pieces,\r\nand, in particular, of the springs.\r\n\r\nBy working with intelligence and perseverance, Dubois de Chemant\r\ngradually obtained satisfactory results, and when, in 1788, he\r\npublished his first pamphlet on mineral teeth, he had already made\r\ndentures and partial prosthetic pieces for a certain number of persons,\r\nwho wore them to great advantage.\r\n\r\nAs to the chemist Duchâteau, from 1776 to 1788, that is, during\r\nthe twelve years subsequent to his communication to the Academy of\r\nSurgeons, he did absolutely nothing at all. He is, therefore, entitled\r\nto the credit of having had a happy idea and of having endeavored\r\nto put it into practice; but the merit of having given life to the\r\nidea, abandoned for so many years by him with whom it originated, is\r\nexclusively due to Dubois de Chemant; he is, therefore, with reason\r\nconsidered the true inventor of mineral teeth.\r\n\r\nDubois de Chemant, however, was so unjust as to take the whole credit\r\nof the invention for himself, declaring in his writings that the\r\noriginal idea had been exclusively his own, and was in no way due to\r\nDuchâteau.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 Dubois de Chemant made his invention known to the Academy of\r\nSciences and to the Faculty of Medicine of Paris; both pronounced in\r\nfavor of it, and in consequence of the opinion given by such high\r\nauthorities, he soon after obtained an inventor’s patent from Louis XVI.\r\n\r\nDubois’ successes now aroused the envy of many of his colleagues, and\r\nespecially of Dubois Foucou, the king’s dentist, who, together with\r\nthe greater part of the dentists of Paris and the chemist Duchâteau,\r\nbrought an action against him, accusing him of having usurped the\r\ninvention of Duchâteau, and demanding, for this reason, the annulment\r\nof the inventor’s patent that had been granted him. But the law\r\ncourts, in an opinion dated January 26, 1792, rejected the demand for\r\nannulment, recognized the patent of invention as fully valid, and\r\ncondemned Dubois Foucou, Duchâteau, and their confederates to the costs\r\nof the judgment.\r\n\r\nParis being at that time in full revolution, Dubois de Chemant was\r\ninduced to emigrate to England. He established himself in London, and\r\nthere obtained a patent without much difficulty, according him the\r\nexclusive right, for fourteen years, of manufacturing dentures of\r\nmineral paste.\r\n\r\nDubois de Chemant wrote several pamphlets in order to make known to the\r\npublic this new kind of dental prosthesis and its advantages; some of\r\nthese were published in Paris (1788, 1790, 1824), and others during his\r\nlong residence in London, where he remained from 1792 to 1817. In these\r\npamphlets he upholds the great superiority of “the incorruptible teeth\r\nof mineral paste” over all other kinds of artificial teeth; he calls\r\nspecial attention to the fact that teeth of bone, ivory, and of every\r\nother organic substance whatever gradually become spoilt through the\r\naction of the saliva, of oral heat, of food and drink, etc., and not\r\nonly lose their primitive color and assume a dirty hue, most unpleasant\r\nto the eye, but acquire a bad odor, at times quite insupportable,\r\nbecoming, besides, a cause of irritation to the gums and the mucous\r\nmembrane of the mouth, not to speak of their gradual softening and\r\nwearing out, which renders them unserviceable after a certain time. All\r\nthese disadvantages were avoided by using the new prosthetic material,\r\nthis being incorruptible and inalterable.\r\n\r\nThe prosthetic appliances by Dubois de Chemant were made in one single\r\npiece that represented the gums and teeth, whether in the case of\r\none or more teeth, or of whole dental sets. He used to take a cast\r\nof the parts on which the prosthesis was to be applied, and by a\r\nprocess, the details of which are not known; he succeeded in obtaining\r\nprosthetic pieces that fitted the parts perfectly, notwithstanding\r\nthe difficulties resulting from the shrinking of the paste in baking.\r\nIf the piece required retouching, he did this by means of special\r\ntools for grinding down porcelain. He could, besides, drill holes\r\nin the porcelain for the application of the means of attachment. In\r\nfact, Dubois de Chemant was the creator of a new method of prosthesis\r\napplicable to any and every case, and which gained the praise and\r\nadmiration of the great doctors and scientists of that day, among whom\r\nmay be mentioned Geoffroy, Vicq d’Asyr, Descemet, Bajet, Petit Radel,\r\nDarcet, Sabatier, Jenner, and others. The Paris Faculty of Medicine\r\ngave it as their judgment that the prosthetic pieces manufactured by\r\nDubois de Chemant united the qualities of beauty, solidity, and comfort\r\nto the exigencies of hygiene.\r\n\r\nThese eulogies must, however, be received with a certain reserve, as,\r\nbeyond doubt, the mineral teeth of that time still left much to be\r\ndesired. In England, where, as we have already said, they had been\r\nintroduced by the inventor, they at first obtained a great success,\r\nwhich was, however, of short duration, and Maury[547] tells us that\r\ntoward 1814 they had fallen into great discredit and had been entirely\r\nabandoned; this signifies that practically they did not fulfil the\r\nexpectations held out.\r\n\r\nDUBOIS FOUCOU and FONZI. Among the first who occupied themselves\r\nwith the manufacturing of mineral teeth, contributing also to their\r\nimprovement, are to be named Dubois Foucou, to whom we have already\r\nmade reference, and Fonzi, an Italian by birth, who exercised the\r\nprofession of dentist in Paris. Dubois Foucou made some improvements in\r\nthe coloring of porcelain teeth, and in 1808 published a pamphlet in\r\nwhich he explained his mode of proceeding in manufacturing them.[548]\r\nIn the same year Fonzi made known a new kind of teeth,[549] which he\r\ncalled _terro-metallic_. These differed from those of Dubois de Chemant\r\nin that they were all single teeth intended to be applied on a base by\r\nmeans of small hooks of platina, with which each tooth was furnished.\r\nIn addition to this important innovation, Fonzi also discovered the\r\nmeans of imitating in some degree the semitransparent tint peculiar to\r\nnatural teeth.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this, the teeth made by Fonzi, of which there are\r\nstill some specimens in various dental museums, had anything but a good\r\nappearance, and there still remained much to be done before mineral\r\nteeth reached the height of perfection which they attained later on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104\r\n\r\nEarliest specimens of mineral teeth.]\r\n\r\nThe credit of having introduced many new improvements in the\r\nmanufacture of mineral teeth belongs especially to the Americans. Among\r\nthose who particularly distinguished themselves in this department of\r\ndental art, we may note Charles W. Peale, Samuel W. Stockton, James\r\nAlcock, and Dr. Elias Wildman. But the most brilliant results, as is\r\nwell known, were obtained by the celebrated Samuel S. White, who, by\r\nan intelligent and persevering activity, dedicated almost exclusively\r\nto improving mineral teeth and to bringing them into general use,\r\ncontributed vastly to the progress of modern dental art. Samuel S.\r\nWhite undoubtedly stands forth as one of the noblest and grandest\r\nfigures in the history of dentistry, and his name will ever be recorded\r\nwith honor and veneration by dentists of all ages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] See Introduction to the German translation of the Ebers’ papyrus,\r\nby Heinrich Joachim, Berlin, 1890.\r\n\r\n[2] The Egyptians had three different kinds of writing: the\r\nhieroglyphic, the hieratic, and the demotic.

This king,\r\npatron of Art and Science, was, for his times, an eminent toxicologist.\r\nBy making experiments on condemned criminals he sought to discover\r\nby what drugs the action of the various poisons, both mineral and\r\nvegetable, and those inoculated by the bites of poisonous animals might\r\nbe counteracted. He afterward mixed the various antidotes together\r\nfor the purpose of obtaining a remedy that might prove a preservative\r\nagainst the action of any poison whatever. This universal remedy,\r\nthe receipt of which was carried to Rome by Pompey, the conqueror of\r\nthat great king, was named _mithridatium_, after the name of him who\r\nhad composed it. Andromachus modified the mithridate; he took away\r\ncertain ingredients and added others, reducing the number of them from\r\nabout eighty to sixty-five. The principal modification was that of\r\nintroducing into the composition of this drug the flesh of the viper;\r\nwherefore, Galen is of the opinion that the theriac (so called from the\r\nGreek word _therion_, a noxious animal) was more efficacious than the\r\nmithridate against the bite of the viper. The theriac still exists in\r\nthe French pharmacopeia, although considerably simplified. In every 4\r\ngrams it contains 5 centigrams of opium.\r\n\r\n[176] A species of solanaceæ of the Physalis genus, probably the\r\nPhysalis alkekengi.\r\n\r\n[177] Galeni de compositione medicamentorum secundum locos, liber v.\r\n\r\n[178] J.

In\r\nan Italian translation of the writings of Johannes Mesue, published\r\nat Venice in 1521, the following interesting reference to the use of\r\narsenic appears:\r\n\r\n“The son of Zachariah Arazi compounds a medicine to assist the\r\nextraction of the teeth. ℞—Pyrethrum, colquintida root and the bark of\r\nthe mulberry root, the seed and leaves of almezeron, huruc, and yellow\r\narsenic, milk of alscebram or pieces of it, ground very thoroughly\r\nwith vinegar; then pour some of it over bdellium and halasce, of each,\r\nequal parts, dry and dissolve in strong vinegar and make trochisi of\r\nit, and with them anoint the roots of the tooth from hour to hour; this\r\nfacilitates the extraction of it.\r\n\r\n“There is also another medicine with which one fills the decayed tooth\r\nand breaks it: ℞—Seeds of almezeron and milk of alscebram compounded\r\nwith liquid pitch, and fill with it the decayed tooth. Another one:\r\n℞—Bauras, bark of the willow, of each, one part; yellow arsenic, two\r\nparts; compound with honey and place it upon and around the tooth and\r\nimmediately extract it.\r\n\r\n“The fat of the green frog which lives upon the trees breaks teeth\r\nwhich are anointed with it the same as when you anoint them with milk\r\nof alscebram or titimallo, and similarly also the milk of celso with\r\nyellow arsenic.”\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is also interesting to note that the ancient\r\nArabian medical writers referred to the red sulphide of arsenic or\r\nrealgar as sandarach. The term Sandarach was clearly used by these\r\nwriters to designate two different medicaments—one the gum-vernix,\r\nexudate of the Juniper tree, and which we now know as Sandarach gum.\r\nThey also apply the term to red arsenic, as above stated. Avicenna\r\nclearly distinguishes between the two kinds of Sandarach, and says\r\nwith regard to the gum-vernix or Juniper Sandarach that it is the best\r\nof all known remedies for toothache. While, as shown by Dr. Guerini,\r\nmany of the medicaments used as topical applications to facilitate\r\nthe extraction of teeth were wholly without any possible effect of\r\nthat character, it cannot be doubted that the application of arsenical\r\npreparations, such as those referred to by Mesue, could not fail to\r\nset up an arsenical necrosis about the roots of the tooth, rendering\r\nit loose and easy of removal, but necessarily with the disadvantage of\r\nproducing a dangerously extensive necrosis of the tissues.\r\n\r\n_Mesue Vulgar._—Impresso in Venitia per Cesaro Arrivabeno Venitiano a\r\ndi vinti octubrio, mille cinquecento e vintiuno.\r\n\r\nDelle Medicini Particulare, Libro Quarto, Capitolo XLI.—E.

To make clear the meaning of these names, the\r\nfollowing must be noted: The _rasoirs_ (_rasoria_) were instruments\r\nwith one cutting edge alone, which were used in performing any kind\r\nof incision. _Raspatoria_ (râpes, _i. e._, rasps) signified almost\r\ncertainly scrapers, not rasps. The _spatumes_ were instruments with\r\none or two cutting edges, of various shapes, but usually small.\r\n_Esprouvettes_ (Latin, _probæ_) were the sounds or probes. _Scalpra_\r\nmeans scalpels, but in this case has especially the meaning of\r\n_déchaussoirs_, gum lancets. _Terebelli_ (French, _Tarières_) are the\r\ntrepans or perforators.\r\n\r\n[243] Nicaise, p. 507.\r\n\r\n[244] By the word _apostema_, Guy de Chauliac, and many other writers,\r\nindicate every pathological condition in which the normal elements of\r\nthe tissues are separated from one another, by a humorous or gaseous\r\ngathering, or by any phlogistic or neoplastic formation. The word\r\nsignifies, in Greek, _removal_, just like the Latin word _abscessus_.\r\nIn fact, these two terms were often used as synonyms; but at other\r\ntimes the word apostema had a wider meaning, and included, besides the\r\nabscess, the phlegmon, the furunculus, the anthrax, erysipelas, herpes,\r\nand other dermal affections, especially the pustulous ones, edema and\r\nother serous gatherings, subcutaneous emphysema and other gaseous\r\ngatherings, glandular tumefactions, cysts, benignant and malignant\r\ntumors.\r\n\r\n[245] De la dent esbranlée et affoiblie, Nicaise, p. 509.\r\n\r\n[246] “De l’humidité qui amollist le nerf et le ligament.”\r\n\r\n[247] Evidently the author speaks of a “little gold chain,” because, as\r\nhe is not versed in the practice of dentistry, he does not know that it\r\nwas a simple gold wire which was used for keeping loose teeth firm. A\r\nsmall chain as thin as a thread could not be possibly made, and would\r\neven then be excessively weak.\r\n\r\n[248] This name was first given to medicaments containing gall-nuts,\r\nthen, by extension, also to compound remedies not containing such\r\nsubstance, and to which was given the name of _aliptæ_, v.

Now he had a new servant, Picard, tall and strong, who\r\nwanted to pull teeth like his master. It happened that whilst the said\r\nFrançois Louys was dining, a villager wanting a tooth pulled, Picard\r\ntook his master’s instrument and tried to do like him, but instead of\r\ntaking out the bad tooth, he knocked and tore out three good ones for\r\nhim, who, feeling great pain and seeing three teeth out of his mouth,\r\nbegan to cry out against Picard, but he, to make him hold his peace,\r\ntold him not to say a word about it and not to shout so, because if his\r\nmaster came he would make him pay for three teeth instead of one. Now\r\nthe master, hearing such a noise, came out from table to know the cause\r\nof it and the reason of the quarrel, but the poor peasant fearing the\r\nthreats of Picard and still more after enduring such pain being made\r\nto pay a threefold fee by the said Picard, was silent, not daring to\r\nreveal to the master this fine piece of work of the said Picard; and\r\nthus the poor bumpkin went away, and for one tooth that he had thought\r\nto have pulled, he carried away three in his pouch and the one that\r\nhurt him in his mouth.”\r\n\r\n[308] For which reason I advise those who would have their teeth pulled\r\nto go to the older tooth-pullers, and not to the younger ones who will\r\nnot yet have recognized their shortcomings.”\r\n\r\n[309] An old French word meaning perhaps hippopotamus.\r\n\r\n[310] Jacobi Hollerii medici parisiensis omnia opera practica, Genevæ,\r\n1635, lib. ii, p. 117, et seq.\r\n\r\n[311] Blandin, Anatomie du système dentaire, Paris, 1836, p. 25.\r\n\r\n[312] Hoann Jac.

Now that\r\nI have found one, I announce that I have obeyed your commands. As for\r\nthe ‘Golden Tooth,’ I ought not to hide from you that we have more\r\nthan once marvelled at your shrewdness, in that you are so anxious to\r\nascribe the devices of wickedness and the tricks (fakes) of cunning\r\nto Nature. For it was no portent, only a deception and pure cheat, so\r\nthat unless some Lemnian (Prometheus or Vulcan) should come to their\r\naid, these acute authors will, nay, already are, a by-word to those\r\nwho are more cautious and not so prone to believe. For the ‘Golden\r\nToothed’ boy, according to the account brought thither by many persons,\r\nboth by letter and oral report, some of whom had themselves seen\r\nthis wonder, hailed from a village near Schwidnitz in Silesia, and\r\nhad been so trained by his swindling father or master, that, at his\r\nwill, whenever in any assembly of men, some very simple and illiterate\r\npersons desired to see the tooth and had paid the fee, for the rascals\r\nmade great gains, he would open his mouth wide and allow himself to be\r\ntouched. But if educated men and those who seemed likely to make more\r\ncareful scrutiny and experiment on any point, presented themselves,\r\nhe contorted his countenance, remained silent, and simulated a kind\r\nof madness, the idea being that he permitted himself to be examined\r\nat stated times only when the conditions allowed. Now, the tooth was\r\ncovered with a plate, lamina (or layer), skilfully wrought of the best\r\ngold, and the gold was let down so deep into the gum that the cheat\r\nwas not observed. However, as the plate was sometimes rubbed with a\r\ntouch-stone as a test and was daily worn down by chewing, the real\r\ntooth at last began to appear. Of this fact a certain nobleman got an\r\ninkling, came to the place pretty drunk, and demanded that the tooth\r\nshould be shown him, when the young fellow, at his master’s word, kept\r\nsilent, the nobleman struck his dagger into the boy’s mouth, wounding\r\nhim so badly that the aid of a surgeon had to be called, and so the\r\ndeception was fully exposed.\r\n\r\n“Thus the Herr Baron Fabianus, in Crema, at present Rector Magnificus\r\nof our University, told me the story in full, and those inhabitants of\r\nthe place who have scholarly tastes maintain it to a man. The author\r\nof the fraud, if I remember aright, was said to have taken refuge in\r\nflight, the boy to be in chains.\r\n\r\n“Our Pelargus, who is a native of Schwidnitz, can inform you more\r\nfully. I have often heard from him the same facts which I am writing.\r\nFarewell, and laugh in safety as much as you please at those sagacious\r\nauthors.\r\n\r\n“FRANKFORT, December 31, 1595.”\r\n\r\nElsewhere it is stated that the boy who was the possessor of the\r\n“Golden Tooth” was born December 22, 1586. As Horst’s Treatise appeared\r\nin 1595, the Silesian boy was probably not over seven or eight years of\r\nage. We also find that the “Golden Tooth” was a lower molar, and upon\r\nthe left side, and further, that there was no molar posterior to it.—E.\r\nC.

The barbers considered themselves\r\nmembers of the medical class, as practitioners of decorative medicine\r\nand in a certain degree also of surgery.\r\n\r\n[380] In a chapter entitled “Of the Excellence and Nobility of the\r\nBarber’s Office,” Cintio d’Amato speaks of several barbers of that\r\nperiod, who were in great repute by their writings, or by the high\r\noffices with which they were invested, or by honors received from\r\nprinces and sovereigns. Among the writers, Tiberio Malfi, barber of\r\nMontesarchio, deserves mention; he published, in 1626, a book entitled\r\nThe Barber, written in excellent style, and giving proof of solid\r\nliterary culture, and of much erudition. This work treats of all that\r\nconcerns the barber’s art (decorative medicine, bleeding, etc.). In it,\r\nhowever, there is absolutely nothing about the treatment of the teeth\r\nor their extraction; and this constitutes a valid confirmation of our\r\nown opinion, that is, that the dental art was not at that time in any\r\nway in the hands of the barbers.\r\n\r\n[381] Portal, vol. iii, p. 618.\r\n\r\n[382] Antonii Nuck operationes et experimenta chirurgica, Lugduni\r\nBatavorum, 1692.\r\n\r\n[383] Caroli Musitani opera omnia, pp. 121 to 128, Venetiis, 1738.\r\n\r\n[384] J.

In the title of his work Schaffer describes himself as\r\nProtestant preacher at Regensburg, member of the Royal Society of\r\nFine Arts at Göttingen, of the Royal Society of Science at Duisberg,\r\nhonorary member of the Fine Arts at Leipsic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. I., Fig. II., Fig. III., Fig. IV., Fig. V.,\r\nFig. VI., Fig. VII., Fig. VIII., Fig. IX., Fig. X., Fig. XI., Fig. XII.]\r\n\r\nThe several details of the plate are designated as follows:\r\n\r\nFig. I. The supposed worms, with single and double tails, or actually\r\nseed buds of the henbane driven out by heat, natural size.\r\n\r\nFig. II. Kidney-shaped seed of the henbane, natural size, without seed\r\nbuds.\r\n\r\nFig. III. Another such seed, natural size, with the pith being driven\r\nout in bow-shape.\r\n\r\nFigs. IV and V. Slightly magnified supposed entrails of the tooth\r\nworms, actually the inner basis substance for the development of the\r\nseed lobes.\r\n\r\nFig. VI. Portion of the skin and driven out supposed entrails of the\r\ntooth worms, strongly magnified: (_aa_) skin still attached; (_b_)\r\nsupposed entrails.\r\n\r\nFig. VII. Seed same as Fig. II, magnified: (_a_) external pellicle;\r\n(_b_) seed bud.\r\n\r\nFig. VIII. Seed of Fig. III, magnified: (_aa_) external pellicle; (_b_)\r\nnode; (_c_) seed bud driven out in bow-shape.\r\n\r\nFigs. IX, X, and XI. Three kinds of supposed tooth worms, magnified;\r\nthe lettering corresponds in all three: (_a_) head; (_b_) brown spot\r\nor mouth; (_c_) body; (_d_) apparent opening or anus; (_ee_) single or\r\ndouble tail; (_ff_) brown spot of the tail; also an apparent opening.\r\n\r\nFig. XII. Representation of the utensils and the mode in which they\r\nare arranged during the application of the supposed remedy against\r\ntooth worms: (_a_) earthen pot; (_b_) opening visible on one side;\r\n(_c_) opening in the bottom; (_dd_) iron passing through the two side\r\nopenings, on which the wax balls (containing henbane seeds) are laid\r\ninside the pot; (_e_) smoke arising through the opening in the top,\r\nwhich is directed into the mouth; (_ff_) bowl of water in which the pot\r\nis set, into which the supposed worms fall and in which they are found\r\nafter the cure.\r\n\r\nIt would seem not at all improbable that the inhalation of vapors\r\narising from heated henbane seeds might in some cases, _e.g._, of\r\nodontalgia from pulpitis, produce a sedative effect by the action of\r\nthe hyoscyamine given off. Assuming that the method possessed even a\r\nslight therapeutic value, that factor in connection with the apparently\r\ntangible evidence of the existence of tooth worms which it afforded to\r\nthe ignorant, makes the method a most interesting example of the way in\r\nwhich superstition and ignorance about medical matters are kept alive\r\nand sustained by a very slight increment of truth.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting reference to the use of henbane seeds for the\r\ncure of toothache by fumigation as found in an old Saxon manuscript\r\nof the ninth or tenth century, a translation of which is published in\r\nLeechdoms, Worthcunning, and Starcraft of Early England, vol. ii, p.\r\n51, a collection of documents illustrating the history of science in\r\nEngland before the Norman conquest, published under direction of the\r\nMaster of the Rolls. The reference is as follows:\r\n\r\n“For tooth wark, if a worm eat _the tooth_, take an old holly leaf and\r\none of the lower umbels of hartwort and the upward _part_ of sage,\r\nboil two doles (that is, two of worts to one of water) in water, pour\r\ninto a bowl and yawn over it, then the worms shall fall into the bowl.\r\nIf a worm eat the teeth, take holly rind over a year old, and root of\r\nCarline thistle, boil in so hot _water_! Hold in the mouth as hot as\r\nthou hottest may. For tooth worms, take acorn meal and henbane seed\r\nand wax, of all equally much, mingle _these_ together, work into a\r\nwax candle and burn it, let it reek into the mouth, put a black cloth\r\nunder, then will the worms fall on it.”—E.
