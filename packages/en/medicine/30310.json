S., V. M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicines may be administered to cattle in many ways. The channel and\r\nmethod of administration depend on whether a general or local effect is\r\ndesired, the condition of the animal, and the nature of the medicine that\r\nis to be given. The easiest method, and therefore the most common, is to\r\ngive ordinary remedies by the mouth with the food, with drink, or\r\nseparately. There, are, however, some conditions in which medicines\r\nadministered in this way will not act promptly enough, or wherein a desired\r\neffect of the medicine on a distant part of the body is wholly lacking\r\nunless it is applied in some other way.\r\n\r\nThe various methods of administering medicines to cattle will be considered\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nBY THE MOUTH.--The simplest way to give medicines by the mouth is to mix\r\nthem with the food or water. This can be done when the medicine is in the\r\nform of a powder or fluid, if but a small quantity is to be given, if it\r\ndoes not have a taste that is disagreeable to the animal and is not so\r\nirritant as to injure the lining membranes of the mouth and throat.\r\n\r\nThe usual method of administering bulky or unpalatable doses is to mix them\r\nwith a fluid vehicle, such as water, milk, molasses, or broth, and give\r\nfrom a bottle. A dose given in this way is known as a \"drench.\" In\r\nadministering a drench the head of the animal should be elevated a little\r\nby an assistant. This is best accomplished when standing on the left side\r\nof the cow's head and by grasping the nose with the thumb and fingers of\r\nthe right hand inserted in the nostrils; with the left hand beneath the\r\nchin the head is further raised and supported. If the animal is unruly, it\r\nmay be tied in a stall or placed in a stanchion. The medicine can now be\r\npoured into the mouth by inserting the neck of the bottle between the lips\r\non the right side. Care must be taken to avoid getting the bottle between\r\nthe back teeth. The mouth of the bottle should be inserted as far as the\r\nmiddle of the tongue and the contents poured slowly. If the cow coughs, the\r\nhead must at once be lowered to permit the fluid to escape from the larynx.\r\nIf medicine is given during coughing, some of the dose may pass down the\r\nwindpipe to the lungs and cause a severe or a fatal pneumonia. This is\r\nespecially to be guarded against when the throat is partly paralyzed or\r\ninsensitive, as in parturient paresis (milk fever). In this disease it has\r\noften happened that drenches have been poured into the lungs, thus killing\r\nthe cow.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of fluid to be given in a drench depends upon the effect\r\ndesired and the nature of the medicine. In impactions of the stomach very\r\nlarge quantities of fluid may be given--as much as a gallon or several\r\ngallons at a time. Usually, however, it is not customary or desirable to\r\ngive more than from 1 to 2 quarts at a dose, and not more than a pint\r\nunless it is necessary on account of the irritant quality of the drug that\r\nhas to be shielded with a large quantity of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nSoluble medicines should be completely dissolved before they are given;\r\ninsoluble ones should be finely divided by powdering or by shaking, and\r\nshould be well agitated and mixed immediately before they are given. In the\r\nlatter case a menstruum with considerable body, such as molasses or\r\nflaxseed tea or milk, will help to hold solids or oils in suspension until\r\nswallowed.\r\n\r\n_Balls_ are large pills adapted for the larger animals. Powders or gums are\r\nsometimes mixed with an adhesive substance and rolled into balls for the\r\npurpose of convenience of administration. Balls are not used so much and\r\nare not so well adapted to the medication of cattle as of horses. The\r\nprocess of solution is slower in the paunch of a cow than in the stomach of\r\na horse; if the cow is so sick as to have stopped ruminating, a ball may\r\nget covered up and lost in the mass of material in the paunch and so lie\r\nfor days, producing no effect whatever.\r\n\r\n_Capsules_ are shells or envelopes made of soluble gelatin in which powders\r\nor liquids may be inclosed. Capsules and balls are administered by being\r\nplaced on the tongue well back in the mouth while the tongue is drawn\r\nforward and the mouth is held open by a block of wood between the back\r\nteeth. The ball should be dropped, the tongue released, and the block\r\nremoved as nearly simultaneously as possible, so that the backward carriage\r\nof the tongue will throw the ball into the throat and lead to its being\r\nswallowed. In introducing the ball care must be taken to avoid having the\r\nhand cut or crushed. After a little experience it is possible to do away\r\nwith the block of wood.\r\n\r\nBY THE STOMACH.--Medicines are introduced directly into the first stomach\r\nby the use of an esophageal tube or through the cannula of a trocar passed\r\ninto the paunch through the side. This method is used in the treatment of\r\ndiseases of digestion.\r\n\r\nBY THE RECTUM.--Medicines are usually administered by the rectum for the\r\npurpose of controlling the bowels and for the treatment of local diseases.\r\nSometimes, however, medicines that have a general effect are given in this\r\nway when, for any reason, it is not possible or convenient to give them\r\nthrough the mouth. Only drugs that are readily absorbed should be given per\r\nrectum for a general effect and in somewhat larger dose or more frequently\r\nthan when given by the mouth. Such stimulants as ether, alcohol, or the\r\naromatic spirits of ammonia, diluted with from four to six times their bulk\r\nof warm water, may be used in this way.\r\n\r\nRectal injections, or enemata, are used in the treatment of constipation.\r\nIf it is the purpose of the injection to soften hardened fecal masses, the\r\nwater should be comfortably warm and may have a little clean soap in it. If\r\nit is the purpose of the injection to stimulate sluggish bowels to\r\ncontraction, the water may be cold.\r\n\r\nIn giving rectal injections a rectal syringe may be used, or, better, a\r\npiece of one-half to three-quarter inch rubber hose 5 feet long with a tin\r\nfunnel attached to one end. The hose is soaped or oiled and introduced\r\nslowly and gently into the rectum 2 or 3 feet. The fluid is then slowly\r\npoured into the funnel and allowed to gravitate into the rectum. The same\r\napparatus may be used for feeding by the rectum.\r\n\r\nBY THE VAGINA.--Medicines are inserted into the vagina, and through the\r\nvagina into the womb, in a manner similar to that of rectal administration.\r\nMost of the medication made use of in this way is for the local treatment\r\nof these organs. Following calving, during outbreaks of abortion, and in an\r\ninfectious disease of the vagina, such injections become necessary.\r\n\r\nBY THE UDDER.--Injections into the udder are now regularly made in the\r\ntreatment of parturient paresis (milk fever). For this purpose a 1 per cent\r\nsolution of iodid of potassium is commonly employed, although some other\r\nsolutions and oxygen gas are also used. In making this injection so many\r\nprecautions are necessary in relation to the sterilization of the apparatus\r\nand the teats and skin that this work should be left to a skilled\r\nveterinarian. The introduction of even a minute quantity of infectious dirt\r\nmay cause the loss of the udder. For making this injection one may use one\r\nof the prepared sets of apparatus or a milking tube and funnel connected by\r\na piece of small rubber hose. The apparatus should be boiled and kept\r\nwrapped in a clean towel until needed. The udder and teats and the hands of\r\nthe operator must be well disinfected, and the solution must be freshly\r\nmade with recently boiled water kept in a sterile bottle. The udder should\r\nbe emptied of milk before the injection is made. After all these\r\nprecautions have been observed the milking tube may be inserted and through\r\nit one-half pint of solution introduced by gravity air pressure or by\r\nsyringe. There is practically no danger in this mode of treatment if it is\r\nproperly carried out.\r\n\r\nInjections into the udder are sometimes made in the treatment of garget,\r\nbut so far with indifferent success.\r\n\r\nBY THE NOSTRILS.--An animal may be caused to inhale medicine in the form of\r\ngas or vapor or to snuff up a fine powder. Sometimes, for the purpose of\r\nlocal treatment, fluids are injected into the nose.\r\n\r\nA medicine inhaled may have either a local or a general effect.\r\n\r\nMedicated steam, carrying the volatile products of compound cresol\r\nsolution, carbolic acid, balsam of Peru, compound tincture of benzoin,\r\ntincture of iodin, etc., may be liberated beneath the nostrils of a cow so\r\nthat she must inhale these soothing vapors; but such treatment is not so\r\ncommon for cattle as for horses. In producing general anesthesia, or\r\ninsensibility to pain, the vapor of chloroform or ether is administered by\r\nthe nostrils. As a preliminary to this it is necessary to cast and confine\r\nthe animal. Great care is necessary to avoid complete stoppage of the heart\r\nor breathing.\r\n\r\nBY THE TRACHEA.--Medicines are injected into the trachea, or windpipe, in\r\nthe treatment of some forms of diseases of the lungs, and especially in\r\nthat form of bronchitis or pneumonia that is caused by lungworms. For this\r\ninjection a large hypodermic syringe, fitted with a very thick, strong\r\nneedle, is used. The needle is to be inserted about the middle of the neck\r\nand between the cartilaginous rings of the trachea.\r\n\r\nBY THE SKIN.--Although a number of drugs, notably mercury, are so readily\r\nabsorbed by the skin of cattle as to render poisoning easy, medicines are\r\nnot given in this way for their general or constitutional but only for\r\ntheir local effect.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the skin and superficial parasites are treated or destroyed by\r\napplications in the forms of washes, ointments, dips, and powders.\r\nLiniments and lotions are applied to the skin for the relief of some\r\nnear-lying part, such as a muscle, tendon, or joint. Blisters are applied\r\nto the skin for the purpose of obtaining the effect of counterirritation\r\nupon a neighboring region or organ. Cold water may be applied to the skin\r\nto reduce the temperature and to diminish congestion or inflammation in a\r\nsuperficial area or to reduce the temperature of the whole body. High fever\r\nand heat strokes are treated in this way.\r\n\r\nBY THE TISSUE BENEATH THE SKIN.--Hypodermic or subcutaneous injections are\r\noften made for the purpose of introducing a drug, reagent, or vaccine\r\ndirectly into the connecting tissue beneath the skin. Introduced in this\r\nway, the substance is quickly absorbed, none of it is lost, and its whole\r\neffect is obtained, often within a few minutes.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous precautions necessary in making a subcutaneous\r\ninjection, most of which have to do with cleansing and sterilization. It is\r\nalso important to select a proper site for the injection, so that blood\r\nvessels, joints, and superficial nerves, organs, or cavities may all be\r\navoided. With due regard for the necessary precautions, there is\r\npractically no danger in such an injection, but it should be attempted only\r\nby those who are able to carry it through in a surgically clean way. Only\r\ncertain drugs can be given subcutaneously, and dosage must be accurately\r\ngraduated.\r\n\r\nBY THE VEINS.--Certain medicines act most promptly and surely when\r\nintroduced directly into the blood by injecting them into a vein, usually\r\nthe jugular. Some vaccines and antitoxins are administered in this way.\r\nIntravenous injection should be practiced only by experienced\r\nveterinarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBy A. J. MURRAY, M. R. C. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by R.W. HICKMAN, V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF FEEDS AND FEEDING.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the digestive organs are very common among cattle, and may\r\noften be traced to defects in feeding. The first three stomachs of the\r\nlarger ruminants hold the feed for a long time, during which period it is\r\nsubjected to macerating, mixing, and straining processes in preparation for\r\nentrance into the fourth or true stomach. The straining is accomplished\r\nthrough the medium of the manyplies or book, while the paunch, or rumen,\r\nwith its adjunct, the waterbag, is concerned in the macerating, kneading,\r\nand mixing, as well as in regurgitation for rumination or the chewing of\r\nthe cud. The action of the first three stomachs is merely preparatory to\r\ndigestion. Thus it would seem that as a result of their complex anatomical\r\nand functional arrangement the feed of the ox, when of good quality and\r\nwholesome, is in the most favorable condition possible for the digestive\r\nprocess when it reaches the fourth stomach, where true digestion first\r\ntakes place. The location and arrangement of the stomachs are shown in\r\nPlates I and II.\r\n\r\nIf the feed is of improper character, or is so given that it can not be\r\ncared for by the animal in a normal way, false fermentations arise, causing\r\nindigestion, and possibly, later, organic disease. In feeding cattle there\r\nare a number of important considerations apart from the economy of the\r\nration, and some of these are noted below.\r\n\r\nFeeds must not be damaged by exposure to the weather, by frost, by molds,\r\nor by deleterious fermentations.\r\n\r\nDamaged feeds retard or prevent digestion, and sometimes they contain or\r\ncause to be generated substances that irritate the digestive tract, or are\r\ndistinctly poisonous to the animal. For example, hay that was rained on\r\nseverely during curing has not only lost a part of its nutritive value\r\nthrough a washing-out process, but what remains is not so readily available\r\nas in good hay. Roots that have been frozen are likely to irritate and\r\ninjure the digestive tract. Grass eaten with frost on it may cause severe\r\nindigestion. All moldy feeds are not injurious, for some molds appear to\r\nhave no influence on the process of digestion, but those of other species\r\nmay not only retard digestion and cause local injury to the digestive\r\norgans, but may cause general poisoning of a severe and fatal type.\r\n\r\nThe following molds have been shown (Dammann) to be dangerous in respect to\r\nthe production of the morbid conditions enumerated:\r\n\r\n_Tilletia caries_ grows chiefly in wheat and may be found with the grain,\r\nthus appearing in the bran or meal. It causes paralysis of the throat and\r\nspinal cord and irritation of the digestive tract. The rusts, such as\r\n_Puccinia graminis_, _P. straminis_, _P. Coronata_, and _P. arudinacea_,\r\ncause colic and diarrhea, and in some cases partial paralysis of the\r\nthroat. The rusts that occur on clovers, beans, and peas cause very severe\r\nirritation of the lining membrane of the mouth and throat, resulting\r\nsometimes in gangrene of this tissue.\r\n\r\n_Polydesmus exitans_ grows on the leaves of rape and turnips, appearing in\r\nearly summer. This fungus is very irritating to the mouths and feet of\r\ncattle, causing severe inflammation and the formation of a false membrane.\r\nIn some instances this condition has been mistaken for foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease, but it can be differentiated by the absence of the blister that\r\nis characteristic of that disease and by the further fact that it is\r\nnontransmissible.\r\n\r\n_Polytrincium trifolii_, which grows on clover, causing it to become black,\r\ncauses severe irritation of the stomach and intestines of cattle feeding\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\nFeeds must not contain too large a proportion of woody fiber or of\r\nindigestible substances. If the dry matter ingested or the bulk of the feed\r\nis very great on account of the small proportion of digestible matter, it\r\nis impossible for the great mass to be moistened properly with and attacked\r\nby the digestive juices. In consequence of this, abnormal fermentations\r\narise, causing indigestion and irritation of the digestive organs. On the\r\nother hand, a ration too concentrated, and especially too rich in protein,\r\nis not suitable, because, after a meal, the animal must have a certain\r\nfeeling of fullness in order to be comfortable and quiet, and the digestive\r\norgans require a relatively large volume of contents to fill them to the\r\npoint where secretion is properly stimulated and their activity is most\r\nefficient. If too much protein is in the ration there is a waste of\r\nexpensive feed, and the tendency is for the animal to become thin. It is\r\nevident that a cow can not thrive on concentrated feeds alone, even though\r\nthese contain in assimilable form all the nutritive materials needed for\r\nperfect support. It is because bulk is necessary that the standard of about\r\n25 pounds of dry matter per cow per day has been reached by experimenters.\r\nThere is no objection to feeding grain or meal separately to a cow,\r\nprovided enough bulky feed is fed at another time in the day to keep the\r\ndigestive tract sufficiently distended.\r\n\r\nIn changing the ration, and especially in making radical changes, as at the\r\nbeginning and the end of the pasturing season, the change should be made\r\ngradually, so that the digestive organs may accommodate themselves to it.\r\nAfter the digestive organs and juices have from long practice become\r\nadjusted to the digestion of a certain feed, which is then suddenly\r\nwithheld and another of quite different character and properties is\r\nsubstituted, the second feed is not well digested; it may even irritate the\r\ndigestive canal. It is often observed that cattle lose from 25 to 100\r\npounds when turned on pasture from dry stable feed. This loss can readily\r\nbe prevented by not shocking the digestive organs by a sudden change of\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\nRegularity in feeding has much to do with the utilization of the ration,\r\nand gross irregularity may cause indigestion and serious disease.\r\n\r\nWater for live stock should be as free from contamination and as nearly\r\npure as that used for household purposes. When practicable it is well to\r\nwarm the water in the winter to about 50∞ F. and allow cattle to drink\r\noften.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE MOUTH.\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND CONTUSIONS OF THE LIPS, AND SNAKE BITE.\r\n\r\nThe lips may become inflamed from contusions, which are sometimes produced\r\nby a blow from the horns of another animal, or, in the case of working\r\noxen, by a blow from the driver. While cattle are grazing, more especially\r\nwhen they are in woods, they may be bitten in the lips by insects or\r\nserpents.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--As a result of a contusion the lips become thick and swollen,\r\nand if treatment is neglected the swelling may become hard and indurated,\r\nor an abscess may form. This condition renders it difficult for the animal\r\nto get food into its mouth, on account of the lips having lost their\r\nnatural flexibility. In such cases an ox will use his tongue more in the\r\nprehension of food to make up for the incapacity of the lips. In cases of\r\nsnake bite the swelling is soft or puffy and its limits are not well\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When we have to deal with a bruise, the affected part should\r\nbe bathed with hot water two or three times daily. In recent cases no other\r\ntreatment will be required, but if the swelling is not recent and has\r\nbecome hard or indurated, then the swollen part should be treated each day\r\nby painting it with tincture of iodin. In snake bite a straight incision\r\npenetrating into the flesh or muscle should be made across the center of\r\nthe swelling and in the direction of the long axis of the face. After this\r\nhas been done a small wad of cotton batting should be pressed against the\r\nwounds until the bleeding has almost stopped. Afterwards the following\r\nlotion may be applied to the wounds several times a day: Permanganate of\r\npotassium, half a dram; distilled water, 1 pint. As snake bites are usually\r\nattended with considerable depression, which may terminate in stupor, it is\r\nadvisable to give a stimulant. One ounce of aromatic spirits of ammonia\r\nmixed with a pint of water should be given, and the dose should be repeated\r\nin half an hour if the animal is sinking into a stupefied and unconscious\r\ncondition. The repetition of the dose must depend on the symptoms which the\r\nanimal shows. It must be borne in mind that the object of treatment is to\r\nward off the stupor, which is one of the results of snake bite. The\r\nswelling from an insect bite should be bathed with ammonia water as soon as\r\nnoticed and then treated with frequent applications of hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALIVATION.\r\n\r\nSalivation is a symptom of some general or local disorder. It may be a\r\nsymptom of a general disease, such as rabies or foot-and-mouth disease, or\r\nit may be a purely local trouble, as when copious secretion of the salivary\r\nglands is produced by the eating of irritating plants, such as wild\r\nmustard. When saliva is observed to dribble from the mouth, that part\r\nshould be carefully examined by introducing into the mouth an instrument\r\nlike a balling iron, or, if one is not at hand, by grasping the tongue and\r\npartially withdrawing it from the mouth, and by placing a block of wood\r\nbetween the back teeth, while all parts of the mouth are exposed to a good\r\nlight, so that the presence of any foreign substance may be detected. The\r\ncause is sometimes found to be a short piece of wood becoming fixed on the\r\npalate, its two ends resting on the upper molar teeth of each side; or it\r\nmay be a needle, thorn, or splinter of wood embedded in the tongue.\r\nSometimes a sharp piece of tin or other metal may become partially embedded\r\nin the inner surface of the cheek. Hay occasionally possesses some quality,\r\nusually dependent upon its having heated in the mow or having become moldy,\r\nwhich produces salivation. Second-crop clover and some irritant weeds in\r\nthe pasture or forage may cause salivation. Cattle rubbed with mercurial\r\nointment may swallow enough mercury in licking themselves to bring about\r\nthe same result. (See \"Mercury poisoning,\" p. 57.) Such cases, of course,\r\narise from the constitutional action of mercury, and, on account of the\r\ncommon habit which the animals have of licking themselves, indicate the\r\ndanger of using such preparation externally. Mercury is also readily\r\nabsorbed through the skin, and as cattle are very susceptible to its action\r\nit is thus easy for them to be poisoned by it even without licking it from\r\nthe surface. Cases of mercurial poisoning sometimes follow disinfection of\r\ncattle stables with the usual 1 to 1,000 solution of mercuric chlorid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If salivation depends on the irritation and inflammation set\r\nup by the ingestion of acrid plants, or forage possessing some peculiar\r\nstimulating property, the feed must be changed, and a lotion composed of an\r\nounce of powdered alum dissolved in a quart of water may be syringed into\r\nthe mouth twice a day, using half a pint of the solution each time. If,\r\nhowever, the salivation is due to the presence of a thorn, splinter of\r\nwood, or any other foreign substance embedded in the cheek or tongue, the\r\noffending object should be removed and the mouth washed occasionally with a\r\nweak solution (2 per cent) of carbolic acid and tepid water. When\r\nsalivation is produced by mercurial poisoning or by foot-and-mouth disease,\r\nthe treatment appropriate to those general conditions of the system, as\r\nwell as the local treatment should be applied. (For information about\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease see p. 383.)\r\n\r\n\r\nIRREGULARITIES OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nIrregularities of the teeth may be occasioned by the unequal wearing of\r\nsome of the teeth or by some of the incisors being broken, which may happen\r\nwhen cattle are pastured on sandy or gravelly soil. The molar teeth may\r\nalso show irregular wear from similar causes, or from a disease or\r\nmalformation of the jaw. Their edges may become sharp, or it may happen\r\nthat a molar tooth has been accidentally fractured. It may also occur that\r\na supernumerary tooth has developed in an unusual position, and that it\r\ninterferes with the natural and regular mastication of the feed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The mouth may be examined by grasping the animal's tongue\r\nwith one hand and partially withdrawing it from the mouth, so as to expose\r\nthe incisor and molar teeth to inspection. When it is desired, however, to\r\nexamine the molar teeth with the fingers, so as to obtain a better idea of\r\ntheir condition, an instrument like the balling iron which is used for the\r\nhorse should be introduced into the mouth, so as to separate the jaws and\r\nkeep them apart while the examination is being made. Any sharp edges of the\r\nmolars must be removed by the tooth rasp, such as is used for horses. Any\r\nsupernumerary tooth which interferes with mastication or any tooth which is\r\nfractured or loose should be extracted. In performing such operations it is\r\ndesirable to throw, or cast, the animal, and to have its head held\r\nsecurely, so as to enable the operator to do what is necessary without\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARIES OR DECAY OF THE TEETH.\r\n\r\nThe presence of caries may be suspected if the mouth exhales a bad odor and\r\nif the animal during mastication occasionally stops as if it were in pain.\r\nThe existence of caries in a molar tooth may be ascertained by examining\r\nthe mouth in the manner already described. If one of the molars is found to\r\nbe carious, it should be extracted. When the crown of the tooth has been\r\ndestroyed and only the stump or root is left, extraction is impracticable.\r\nIn case the animal has special value the root stumps may be removed by a\r\nveterinarian by the operation of trephining; otherwise, it is best to sell\r\nthe animal to the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTINOMYCOSIS OF THE JAWBONES (BIG JAW OR LUMPY JAW).\r\n\r\n[See Actinomycosis, p. 440.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF MUCOUS MEMBRANE OF MOUTH (STOMATITIS).\r\n\r\nThe membrane of the mouth may become inflamed by eating some irritating\r\nsubstance or plant, or little vesicles may form in the mouths of calves\r\nwhen they are affected with indigestion, constituting what is termed\r\naphtha.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The saliva dribbles from the mouth, and when the mouth is\r\nexamined the surface of the tongue and other parts appear red and inflamed.\r\nWhen young animals are affected with the form of disease termed aphtha,\r\nsmall red elevations are observed on the tongue and other parts of the\r\nmouth, having little white points on their centers, which consist of the\r\nepithelium of the mucous membrane raised into vesicles. These white patches\r\nare succeeded by ulcerated surfaces, which are caused by the shedding of\r\nthe white patches of epithelium.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When there is merely a reddened and inflamed condition of the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth, it will suffice to syringe it out several\r\ntimes a day with 4 ounces of the following solution: Alum, 1 ounce; water,\r\n2 pints. When the edges of the tongue and other parts of the mouth are\r\nstudded with ulcers, they should be painted over once a day with the\r\nfollowing solution until the affected surface is healed: Permanganate of\r\npotassium, 20 grains; water, 1 ounce. When indigestion is associated with\r\nan ulcerated condition of the mouth, separate treatment is required.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATIVE STOMATITIS (OR ULCERS IN THE MOUTHS OF YOUNG CALVES).\r\n\r\n[See Necrotic stomatitis, p. 464.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMYCOTIC STOMATITIS (SORE MOUTH).\r\n\r\n[See p. 532.]\r\n\r\n\r\nINDURATION OF THE TONGUE (ACTINOMYCOSIS).\r\n\r\n[See Actinomycosis, p. 440.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE PHARYNX AND GULLET.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARYNGITIS (SORE THROAT).\r\n\r\nPharyngitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the pharynx.\r\nIt is frequently associated with inflammatory diseases of the respiratory\r\ntract, such as laryngitis and bronchitis or pleurisy.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The muzzle is dry and the saliva dribbles from the corners of\r\nthe mouth; the animal swallows with difficulty or not at all, and holds its\r\nneck in a stiff, straight position, moving it as little as possible. The\r\neyelids are half closed, the white of the eye is bloodshot, and the animal\r\noccasionally grinds its teeth. After masticating the feed the animal drops\r\nit out of its mouth as if to avoid the pain of swallowing, and also evinces\r\npain when pressure is applied externally on the pharynx and tries to\r\nprevent the pressure from being applied.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Pharyngitis may be produced by a sudden cooling of the surface\r\nof the body, as when cattle are exposed to a cold wind or a cold rain; or\r\nby swallowing irritant substances.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The throat should be syringed three times a day with an ounce\r\nof the following solution: Nitrate of silver, 1-1/2 drams; distilled water,\r\n1 pint. Bland and soothing drinks, such as linseed tea or oatmeal and water\r\nshould occasionally be offered. Diet should consist of soft food, such as\r\nbran mashes with a little linseed meal mixed in them. Dry hay and fodder\r\nshould not be given. Fresh, green grass or sound ensilage may be fed in\r\nsmall quantities. The upper part of the throat and the space between the\r\njaws should be well rubbed once a day with the following liniment: Liquor\r\nammonia fortior, 4 ounces; oil of turpentine, 4 ounces; olive oil, 4\r\nounces; mix. When evidence of blistering appears the application of the\r\nliniment should be stopped and the skin anointed with vaseline. Under the\r\ntreatment described above the inflammation of the throat will gradually\r\nsubside and the animal will be able to swallow as usual in five or six\r\ndays. We need hardly say that during its treatment the sick animal should\r\nbe kept in a comfortable stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAROTITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the parotid gland may arise from the inflammation extending\r\nto it when an ox is affected with pharyngitis or laryngitis, or the\r\ninflammation may commence in the salivary ducts and may depend on some\r\ninfluence the nature of which is unknown. Parotitis sometimes arises from a\r\nblow or contusion severe enough to set up inflammation in the structure of\r\nthe gland. Tuberculosis and actinomycosis may infrequently be characterized\r\nby the lodgment of their parasitic causes in the parotid glands, in which\r\ncase parotitis may be a symptom of either of these diseases.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is an elongated, painful swelling, beginning at the base\r\nof the ear and passing downward along the posterior margin of the lower\r\njaw. The swelling is sometimes limited to one side, and when both are\r\nswollen it is generally larger on one side than on the other. The secretion\r\nof saliva is increased, the appetite is poor, the neck is stiff, so that it\r\nis painful to raise the head, and feed is swallowed with difficulty. In\r\nmany cases the swelling of the glands, when submitted to proper treatment,\r\ndisappears in a comparatively short time. In other cases, however, they\r\nremain enlarged, even after the animal recovers its appetite. In\r\ntuberculosis, lymphatic glands beneath the parotid glands are sometimes\r\nenlarged, thus causing the appearance of enlarged parotid glands.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A warm bran poultice, made by mixing bran with a hot 2 per\r\ncent compound cresol solution in water, should be applied on the swollen\r\ngland and kept in place by means of a bandage. Whenever the poultice has\r\ncooled it should be replaced by a new one. This treatment should be\r\ncontinued until the pain is less and the swelling is reduced or until there\r\nis evidence of pus formation, which may be ascertained by examining the\r\nsurface of the gland with the fingers; and when, on pressing any part of\r\nthe surface, it is found to fluctuate or \"give,\" then we may conclude that\r\nthere is a collection of pus at that place. It is well not to open the\r\nabscess until the fluctuation is well marked, as at this stage the pus or\r\nmatter is near the surface and there is less trouble in healing the wound\r\nthan if the pus is deep seated. The abscess should be opened with a clean,\r\nsharp knife. The poulticing should then be continued for two or three days,\r\nbut the form of the poultice should be changed, by replacing the bran with\r\nabsorbent cotton and pouring the compound cresol solution on the cotton. At\r\nall times the wound should be kept clean and the cavity injected once or\r\ntwice daily with a solution of 1 dram of carbolic acid in 8 ounces of\r\nwater. Under this treatment the pus may cease and the wound heal without\r\ncomplications. Saliva may issue from the orifice and result in the\r\nformation of a salivary fistula. This requires operative treatment by a\r\nqualified veterinarian. When poulticing fails to reduce the swelling or\r\nproduce softening, the inflamed area may be rubbed once daily with\r\ncamphorated oil, compound iodin ointment, or painted twice daily with\r\nLugol's solution of iodin. The diet should be as recommended under\r\nPharyngitis (p. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\nPHARYNGEAL POLYPI.\r\n\r\nTumors form not infrequently in the pharynx, and may give rise to a train\r\nof symptoms varying according to their size and location. The tumor may be\r\nso situated that by shifting its position a little it may partially\r\nobstruct the posterior nares (nostrils), when, of course, it will render\r\nnasal breathing very noisy and labored. In another situation its partial\r\ndisplacement may impede the entrance of air into the larynx. In almost any\r\npart of the pharynx, but especially near the entrance of the gullet, tumors\r\ninterfere with the act of swallowing. As they are frequently attached to\r\nthe wall of the pharynx by a pedicel or stalk, it will be seen that they\r\nmay readily be displaced in different directions so as to produce the\r\nsymptoms before described. Enlarged postpharyngeal lymphatic glands are not\r\nrare in tuberculosis, and by pressing upon the wall of the pharynx and\r\nrestricting the lumen of this organ they cause difficulty in both breathing\r\nand swallowing. Such enlarged glands may be differentiated from tumors by\r\npassing the hand into the cow's throat after the jaws are separated by a\r\nsuitable speculum or gag.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The method of treatment in such cases is to separate the\r\nanimal's jaws with an instrument termed a gag, and then, after drawing the\r\ntongue partially forward, to pass the hand into the pharynx and to twist\r\nthe tumor gently from its attachment. One veterinarian who has had\r\nconsiderable practice in treating this form of disease scrapes through the\r\nattachment of the tumor gradually with his thumb nail. When the attachment\r\nis too strong to be severed in this way an instrument like a thimble, but\r\npossessing a sharp edge at the end, may be used to effect the same purpose,\r\nor the base of the tumor may be severed by the use of a crushing instrument\r\nknown as an Ècraseur.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOKING.\r\n\r\nChoking usually happens from attempting to swallow too large an object,\r\nsuch as a turnip, potato, beet, apple, or pear, though in rare cases it may\r\noccur from bran, chaff, or some other finely divided feed lodging in and\r\nfilling up a portion of the gullet. This latter form of the accident is\r\nmost likely to occur in animals that are greedy feeders.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary somewhat according to the part of the gullet\r\nor throat in which the obstruction is. In most cases there is a discharge\r\nof saliva from the mouth; the animal coughs frequently, and when it drinks\r\nthe water is soon ejected. The cow stops eating and stands back from the\r\ntrough, the expression is troubled, breathing is accelerated, and\r\noftentimes there is bloating as a result of the retention of gas in the\r\npaunch. These symptoms, however, are not always present, for if the\r\nobstacle does not completely close the throat or gullet, gas and water may\r\npass, thus ameliorating the discomfort. If the obstruction is in the neck\r\nportion of the gullet, it may be felt as a lump in the left jugular gutter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the object is in the throat, it is advisable to put a gag\r\nin the animal's mouth, and, while the head is held in a horizontal\r\ndirection by two assistants, to pass the hand into the pharynx, grasp the\r\nforeign body, and withdraw it gradually and steadily. When the substance is\r\nlodged in the upper part of the gullet, pressure should be made by an\r\nassistant in an upward direction against the object while the operator\r\npasses his hand into the pharynx, and if the assistant can not by pressure\r\ndislodge the substance from the gullet, the operator may by passing his\r\nmiddle finger above and partly behind the substance gradually slide it into\r\nthe pharynx and then withdraw it by the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe presence of an obstructing substance in the cervical (neck) portion of\r\nthe gullet may be ascertained by passing the hand along the left side of\r\nthe neck, when a hard and painless swelling will be found to indicate the\r\npresence of the foreign body. In such cases we must endeavor by gentle and\r\npersevering pressure with the thumb and next two fingers to slide the\r\nobstructing substance gradually upward to the pharynx. To facilitate this\r\nit is well to give the animal a half pint of raw linseed or olive oil\r\nbefore the manipulations described are commenced. When the substance has\r\nbeen brought into or nearly into the pharynx, then the mouth gag should be\r\nused, the tongue drawn partially forward with the left hand, and the right\r\nshould be passed backward into the pharynx to withdraw the obstruction.\r\n\r\nWhen bran or chaff causes the trouble it is best to give a small quantity\r\nof oil to lubricate the walls of the gullet, and then by gentle and\r\npersevering pressure, to endeavor to separate and divide the mass and to\r\nwork it downward toward the stomach. This will be assisted by pouring small\r\nquantities of oil and water down the animal's throat. It is not advisable\r\nto use the probang to push down any soft material, such as oats or chaff,\r\nas this generally condenses and renders firmer the obstructing substance by\r\npressing its particles or elements together, so that it forms a solid,\r\nresisting mass which can not be moved.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the foreign body, either because it is in the chest portion\r\nof the esophagus, and so beyond reach, or because too firmly seated, can\r\nnot be dislodged from the neck by pressing and manipulating that part\r\nexternally. In such event we must resort to the use of the probang. (Pl.\r\nIII, figs. 2 and 3.) A probang is a flexible instrument and adapts itself\r\nto the natural curvature of the gullet, and if used cautiously there is not\r\nmuch risk of injury. Before passing the probang, a gag which has an\r\naperture at each end, from which straps pass to be buckled at the back of\r\nthe head below the horns, is introduced into the mouth. (Pl. III, fig. 4.)\r\nThe probang should then be oiled, and, the head and neck being held in a\r\nstraight line by two assistants, the tongue must be partly drawn out of the\r\nmouth, the probang cautiously passed along the roof of the mouth into the\r\npharynx and thence into the gullet, through which it is passed down. If\r\nresistance is met, gentle and continuous pressure must be used, under the\r\ninfluence of which the object will generally in a short time pass into the\r\nstomach. One must be careful not to pass the probang into the larynx and\r\nthence into the windpipe, as an animal may readily be killed in this way.\r\nThis accident is indicated by efforts to cough and by violently disturbed\r\nbreathing. If such symptoms arise the probang must be withdrawn at once. To\r\navoid a wrong passage, the end of the tube should be pressed very slowly\r\nthrough the throat until its presence in the esophagus is assured. After it\r\nis once in the esophagus care is still necessary, because the walls of this\r\ntube may easily be torn.\r\n\r\nSome writers have advised that when the obstruction is lodged in the\r\ncervical (neck) portion of the gullet it should be struck with a mallet, to\r\ncrush it and thus alter its shape, so that it may easily slip down into the\r\nstomach. If the obstructing substance is hard, this will be a dangerous\r\noperation, but if soft--as in the case of a ripe pear, for example--this\r\nprocedure may be safely adopted.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, if pressure applied on the neck fails to move the obstruction\r\nand the probang also fails to move it, it may be divided by a subcutaneous\r\noperation, or the gullet may be opened and the obstructing substance\r\nremoved through the wound. In such cases the assistance of a veterinarian\r\nor a surgeon must be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS AND INJURIES OF THE GULLET.\r\n\r\nSometimes the walls of the gullet may be more or less lacerated or abraded\r\nby the rash and too forcible use of the probang, and the animal\r\nconsequently swallows with pain and difficulty. In such cases dry feed must\r\nbe withheld for five or six days, so as to allow the injured parts to heal,\r\nand the diet must be limited to linseed tea, hay tea, and thin oatmeal\r\ngruel and molasses. The same kind of diet must be fed after the operation\r\nof cutting into the gullet has been performed.\r\n\r\nSometimes the gullet is ruptured and lacerated to such an extent that\r\ntreatment of any kind is hopeless. This has been known to occur when the\r\nhandle of a pitchfork or buggy whip has been pushed down a cow's throat to\r\nremove an obstruction. When such treatment has been applied it is best to\r\nslaughter the animal without delay, as the flesh may be utilized so long as\r\nthere is no fever or general disease, and remedial treatment would be\r\nhopeless. In this connection it may be mentioned that whatever substitute\r\nmay be used for a probang, which sometimes is not at hand, it should be\r\nflexible and should possess a smooth surface. A piece of new rope, with the\r\nend closely wrapped and waxed and then oiled, or a piece of thin garden\r\nhose, or a well-wrapped twisted wire may be used in emergencies.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE STOMACHS.\r\n\r\nACUTE TYMPANITES (HOVEN, OR BLOATING).\r\n\r\nTympanites is a distention of the rumen or paunch with gases of\r\nfermentation, and is manifested outwardly by swelling in the region of the\r\nleft flank.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Tympanites may be caused by any kind of feed which produces\r\nindigestion. When cattle are first turned into young clover they eat so\r\ngreedily of it that tympanites frequently results. Turnips, potatoes,\r\ncabbage, or the discarded pulp from sugar-beet factories may also cause it.\r\nMiddlings and corn meal also frequently give rise to it.\r\n\r\nCare is necessary in turning animals into fields of clover or stubble\r\nfields in which there is a strong growth of volunteer grain. It is always\r\nbetter to keep them from such pasturage while it is wet with dew, and they\r\nshould be taken out when they have eaten a moderate quantity. When cattle\r\nare fed upon pulp from sugar beets, germinated malt, etc., they should be\r\nfed in moderate amounts until they have become accustomed to it, as any of\r\nthese feeds may give rise to severe bloating.\r\n\r\nAn excessive quantity of any of the before-mentioned feeds may bring on\r\nthis disorder, or it may not be caused by excess, but to eating too\r\nhastily. Sometimes the quality of the feed is at fault. Grass or clover\r\nwhen wet by dew or rain frequently disorders digestion and brings on\r\ntympanites; frozen roots or pastures covered with hoar frost should also be\r\nregarded as dangerous. When feed has been eaten too hastily, or when it is\r\ncold and wet, the digestive process is imperfectly performed, and the feed\r\ncontained in the paunch ferments, during which process large quantities of\r\ngas are formed. The same result may follow when a cow is choked, as the\r\nobstruction in the gullet prevents the eructation or passing up of gas from\r\nthe stomach, so that the gas continues to accumulate until tympanites\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The swelling of the left flank is very characteristic, as in\r\nwell-marked cases the flank at its upper part rises above the level of the\r\nbackbone, and when struck with the tips of the fingers emits a drum-like\r\nsound. The animal has an anxious expression, moves uneasily, and is\r\nevidently distressed. If relief is not obtained in time, it breathes with\r\ndifficulty, reels in walking or in standing, and in a short time falls and\r\ndies from suffocation. The distention of the stomach may become so great as\r\nto prevent the animal from breathing, and in some instances the case may be\r\ncomplicated by rupture of the stomach.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the case is not extreme, it may be sufficient to drive the\r\nanimal at a walk for a quarter or half an hour; or cold water by the\r\nbucketful may be thrown against the cow's sides. In some cases the\r\nfollowing simple treatment is successful: A rope or a twisted straw band is\r\ncoated with pine tar, wagon grease, or other unsavory substance and is\r\nplaced in the cow's mouth as a bit, being secured by tying behind the\r\nhorns. The efforts of the animal to dislodge this object result in\r\nmovements of the tongue, jaws, and throat that stimulate the secretion of\r\nsaliva and swallowing, thus opening the esophagus, which permits the exit\r\nof gas and at the same time peristalsis is stimulated reflexly.\r\n\r\nIn urgent cases the gas must be allowed to escape without delay, and this\r\nis best accomplished by the use of the trocar. The trocar is a\r\nsharp-pointed instrument incased in a cannula or sheath, which leaves the\r\nsharp point of the trocar free. (See Pl. III, figs. _5a_ and _5b._) In\r\nselecting the point for using the trocar a spot on the left side equally\r\ndistant from the last rib, the hip bone, and the transverse processes of\r\nthe lumbar vertebrÊ must be chosen. Here an incision about three-fourths\r\nof an inch long should be made with a knife through the skin, and then the\r\nsharp point of the trocar, being directed downward, inward, and slightly\r\nforward, is thrust into the paunch. (Pl. I.) The cannula or sheath of the\r\ntrocar should be left in the paunch so long as any gas continues to issue\r\nfrom it. If the cannula is removed while gas is still forming in the paunch\r\nand the left flank becomes considerably swollen, it may be necessary to\r\ninsert it again. It is well, accordingly, to observe the cannula closely,\r\nand if gas is found to be issuing from it, it should not be removed. When\r\ngas issues from it in considerable quantities the sound accompanying its\r\nescape renders the exact condition obvious. It is occasionally necessary to\r\nkeep the cannula in the stomach for several hours. When this is necessary a\r\npiece of stout cord should be passed round the neck of the cannula\r\nimmediately below the projecting rim and then be passed round the animal's\r\nbody and tied in a secure knot, and a careful attendant must remain with\r\nthe cow during the entire period that the instrument is in place. The rim\r\nsurrounding the mouth of the cannula should be in contact with the skin.\r\nWhenever the person in charge of the cow is convinced that gas has ceased\r\nto issue from the cannula the instrument should be removed.\r\n\r\nThe trocar is to be used only in extreme or urgent cases, though everyone\r\nwho has had experience in treating indigestion in cattle realizes that he\r\nhas saved the lives of many animals by its prompt application.\r\n\r\nWhen the tympanitic animal is not distressed and the swelling of the flank\r\nis not great, or when the most distressing condition has been removed by\r\nthe use of the trocar, it is best to use internal medicine. Two ounces of\r\naromatic spirits of ammonia should be given every half hour in a quart of\r\ncold water; or half an ounce of chlorid of lime may be dissolved in a pint\r\nof tepid water and the dose repeated every half hour until the bloating has\r\nsubsided; or 1 ounce of creolin in 2 quarts of tepid water may be given at\r\none dose or carefully injected through the cannula directly into the paunch\r\nto stop fermentation and the consequent formation of gas. It is generally\r\nnecessary to give a moderate dose of purgative medicine after bloating has\r\nsubsided, as animals frequently show symptoms of constipation after attacks\r\nof indigestion. For this purpose 1 pound of Glauber's salt may be used.\r\n\r\nThe animal should be fed carefully upon easily digested food for several\r\ndays after the bloating has subsided, so that all fermenting matter may\r\npass out of the stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRONIC TYMPANITES.\r\n\r\nCattle, especially those that have been kept in the stable all winter, are\r\nliable to suffer from chronic tympanites. In this form they bloat up after\r\nfeeding, but seldom swell so much as to cause any alarm. The chronic form\r\nof indigestion may also follow an acute attack like that previously\r\ndescribed. This is also a symptom of tuberculosis when the lymphatic glands\r\nlying between the lungs are so enlarged as to press upon and partly occlude\r\nthe esophagus. It may develop in calves as a result of the formation of\r\nhair balls in the stomach.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment should be preceded by a moderate dose of purgative\r\nmedicine: 1 pound of sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) or sulphate of soda\r\n(Glauber's salt), half an ounce of powdered Barbados aloes, 1 ounce of\r\npowdered ginger, 1 pint of molasses. The salts and aloes should be\r\ndissolved by stirring for a few minutes in 2 quarts of lukewarm water, then\r\nthe molasses should be added, and after all the ingredients have been\r\nstirred together for about 10 minutes the dose should be administered.\r\nAfter the operation of the purgative it is generally necessary to give some\r\ntonic and antacid preparation to promote digestion, which is imperfectly\r\nperformed in such cases. The following may be used: Powdered gentian, 3\r\nounces; powdered bicarbonate of potash, 3 ounces; powdered ginger, 3\r\nounces; powdered capsicum, 1 ounce. Mix and divide into 12 powders, one of\r\nwhich should be given three times a day before feeding, shaken up with a\r\npint and a half of water. It is also advantageous in such cases to give two\r\nheaped teaspoonsfuls of wood charcoal, mixed with the animal's feed three\r\ntimes a day. The animal should also go out during the day, as want of\r\nexercise favors the continuance of this form of indigestion. If the dung is\r\nhard, the constipation should be overcome by feeding a little flaxseed\r\ntwice daily or by giving a handful of Glauber's salt in the feed once or\r\ntwice daily, as may be necessary. Roots, silage, and other succulent feeds\r\nare useful in this connection. If tuberculosis is suspected as the cause of\r\nchronic bloating, a skilled veterinarian should make a diagnosis, using the\r\ntuberculin test if necessary. Until it is settled that the cow has not\r\ntuberculosis, she should be kept apart from the other members of the herd.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISTENTION OF RUMEN OR PAUNCH WITH FEED.\r\n\r\nThis form of indigestion is caused by the animal gorging itself with feed,\r\nand arises more from the animal's voracious appetite than from any defect\r\nin the quality of the feed supplied to it. The condition is, however, more\r\nsevere if the feed consumed is especially concentrated or difficult of\r\ndigestion. In cases of this kind there is comparatively no great formation\r\nof gas, and the gas which is formed is diffused through the stomach instead\r\nof accumulating in a layer in its upper part. On pressing the flank with\r\nthe closed fist the indent of the hand remains for a short time in the\r\nflank, as if the rumen were filled with a soft, doughy mass.\r\n\r\nThis form of indigestion should be treated by stimulants, such as aromatic\r\nspirits of ammonia.\r\n\r\nIf the formation of gas is not great and the distention with solid material\r\nis somewhat limited, the animal may be drenched through a piece of ordinary\r\ngarden hose, one end inserted in the mouth, and the other end fitted with a\r\nfunnel, giving 1-1/2 pounds of Epsom salt or Glauber's salt dissolved in 2\r\ngallons of water, at a single dose. Immediately after this treatment the\r\nleft side of the animal, extending below the median line of the abdomen,\r\nshould be powerfully kneaded with the fist, so that the impacted food mass\r\nwill be broken, allowing the water to separate it into small portions which\r\ncan be carried downward for the process of digestion. But if the treatment\r\nfails and the impacted or overloaded condition of the rumen continues, it\r\nmay become necessary to make an incision with a sharp, long-bladed knife in\r\nthe left flank, commencing at the point where it is usual to puncture the\r\nstomach of an ox, and prolong the incision in a downward direction until it\r\nis long enough to admit the hand. When the point of the knife is thrust\r\ninto the flank and the blade cuts downward, the wall of the stomach, the\r\nmuscle, and the skin should all be cut through at the same time. Two\r\nassistants should hold the edges of the wound together so as to prevent any\r\nfood from slipping between the flank and the wall of the stomach, and then\r\nthe operator should remove two-third [sic] of the contents of the rumen.\r\nThis having been done, the edges of the wound should be sponged with a\r\nlittle carbolized warm water, and, the lips of the wound in the rumen being\r\nturned inward, they should be brought together with catgut stitches. The\r\nwound penetrating the muscle and the skin may then be brought together by\r\nsilk stitches, which should pass through the entire thickness of the muscle\r\nand should be about 1 inch apart. The wound should afterwards be dressed\r\nonce a day with a lotion and the animal covered with a tight linen sheet,\r\nto protect the wound from insects and dirt. The lotion to be used in such\r\ncase is made up as follows: Sulphate of zinc, 1 dram; carbolic acid, 2\r\ndrams; glycerin, 2 ounces; water, 14 ounces; mix. It is clear that this\r\noperation requires special skill and it should be attempted only by those\r\nwho are competent.\r\n\r\n\r\nIMAGINARY DISEASES (HOLLOW HORN; LOSS OF CUD; WOLF IN THE TAIL).\r\n\r\nIt would appear quite in place here, in connection with the diseases of the\r\nstomach and bowels of cattle, to consider the three old fallacies or\r\nsuperstitions known by the above names, since these names, whenever and\r\nwherever used, seem to be invariably applied to some form of digestive\r\nderangement or disease having its origin in the stomach and bowels.\r\n\r\nHOLLOW HORN.--In the first place it should be noted that the horns of all\r\nanimals of the ox tribe are hollow. The horn cores are elongations of the\r\nfrontal bones of the skull, and the frontal sinuses, which are the larger\r\nof the air spaces of the head, are prolonged into the horn cores. When a\r\ncow is sick, if the horns are hot it is an evidence of fever; if they are\r\ncold it indicates impaired circulation of the blood; but these\r\nmanifestations of sickness are to be regarded as symptoms of some\r\nconstitutional disorder and do not in themselves require treatment. The\r\ntreatment should be applied to the disease which causes the abnormal\r\ntemperature of the horns. The usual treatment for the supposed hollow horn,\r\nwhich consists in boring the horns with a gimlet and pouring turpentine\r\ninto the openings thus made, is not only useless and cruel, but is liable\r\nto set up an acute inflammation and result in an abscess of the sinus.\r\n\r\nLOSS OF CUD.--The so-called loss of cud is simply a cessation of\r\nrumination, frequently one of the first indications of some form of\r\ndisease, since ruminants stop chewing the cud when they feel sick. Loss of\r\ncud is a symptom of a great many diseases, and when it is detected it\r\nshould lead the observer to try to discover other symptoms upon which to\r\nbase a correct opinion as to the nature of the disease from which the\r\nanimal suffers. No local treatment is required.\r\n\r\nWOLF IN THE TAIL.--This term also seems to be vaguely applied to various\r\ndisturbances of the digestive function, or to some disease which is in\r\nreality in the stomach or bowels.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOMITING.\r\n\r\nVomiting is not to be confounded with rumination, though some writers have\r\nadvanced the opinion that it is merely a disordered and irregular\r\nrumination. It is not of common occurrence in cattle.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Animals which vomit are frequently in poor condition. After\r\nhaving eaten tranquilly for some time the animal suddenly becomes uneasy,\r\narches the back, stretches the neck and head, and then suddenly ejects 10\r\nto 12 pounds of the contents of the rumen. After having done this the\r\nuneasiness subsides and in a short time the animal resumes eating as if\r\nnothing had happened.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The cause of this disordered state of the digestive system in\r\ncattle is usually obscure, but has in some cases been traced to a partial\r\nclosure of the opening into the second stomach or to a distention of the\r\nesophagus. It has been found to occur when there was cancerous disease of\r\nthe fourth stomach, and experimentally it has been shown that a suspension\r\nof digestion or great derangement of this stomach produces considerable\r\nnervous disorder of the rumen and sometimes vomiting or attempts to vomit.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.--Easily digested feed and plenty of water should be given. Fear\r\nand excitement, chasing, or hurrying animals after they have eaten heartily\r\nare liable to bring on this result. In order to overcome irritation which\r\nmay produce vomiting the following draft should be given: Hydrate of\r\nchloral, half an ounce; water, 1 pint. The dose must be repeated when the\r\ncondition of the animal seems to require it. As a rule, treatment is not\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEPRAVED APPETITE (PICA).\r\n\r\nCattle suffering from this disease have a capricious and variable appetite\r\nas regards their ordinary feed but evince a strong desire to lick and eat\r\nsubstances for which healthy cattle show no inclination. Alkaline and\r\nsaline-tasting substances are especially attractive to cattle having a\r\ndepraved appetite and they frequently lick lime, earth, coal, gravel, and\r\neven the dung of other cattle. Cows in calf and young cattle are especially\r\nliable to develop these symptoms. Animals affected in this way lose\r\ncondition, their coat is staring, gait slow, and small vesicles containing\r\nyellow liquid form under the tongue; the milk given by such cows is thin\r\nand watery. Such animals become restless and uneasy, as is indicated by\r\nfrequent bellowing. The disease may last for months, the animal ultimately\r\ndying emaciated and exhausted. Depraved appetite frequently precedes the\r\ncondition in which the bones of cattle become brittle and fracture easily,\r\nwhich is known as osteomalacia.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--From the fact that this disease is largely one of regions, it is\r\ngenerally believed that some condition of the soil and water and of the\r\nlocal vegetation is responsible for it. It is more prevalent some years\r\nthan others, and is most common in old countries, where the soil is more or\r\nless depleted. Cattle pastured on low, swampy land become predisposed to\r\nit. It occasionally happens, however, that one individual in a herd suffers\r\nthough all are fed alike; in such cases the disease must arise from the\r\naffected animal's imperfect assimilation of the nutritive elements of the\r\nfeed which is supplied to it.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The aim in such cases must be to improve the process of\r\ndigestion and to supply the animal with a sufficiency of sound and\r\nwholesome feed. The following should be given to the cow three times a day,\r\na heaping tablespoonful constituting a dose: Carbonate of iron, 4 ounces;\r\nfinely ground bone or \"bone flour,\" 1 pound; powdered gentian, 4 ounces;\r\ncommon salt, 8 ounces; powdered fenugreek, 4 ounces; mix. In addition to\r\nthis, 3 tablespoonfuls of powdered charcoal may be mixed with the feed\r\nthree times a day, and a piece of rock salt should be placed where the\r\nanimal can lick it at will. German veterinarians have had brilliant results\r\nfrom the treatment of this disease with subcutaneous injections of\r\napomorphin in doses of 1-1/2 to 5 grains for three or four days.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIR CONCRETIONS.\r\n\r\nHair concretions, or hair balls, result from the habit which some cattle\r\nhave of licking themselves or other animals. As a result the hairs which\r\nare swallowed are carried around by the contractions of the stomach and\r\ngradually assume the form of a small pellet or ball. This increases in size\r\nas fresh quantities of hair are introduced into the stomach and adhere to\r\nthe surface of the ball. These balls are found most frequently in the\r\nreticulum or second stomach (Pl. II, B), though sometimes in the rumen. In\r\ncalves hair balls are generally found in the fourth stomach. There are no\r\ncertain symptoms by which we can determine the presence of hair balls in\r\nthe stomach, and therefore no treatment can be recommended for such cases.\r\nIn making post-mortem examinations of cattle we have sometimes found the\r\nwalls of the reticulum transfixed with nails or pieces of wire, and yet the\r\nanimal had not shown any symptoms of indigestion, but had died from\r\nmaladies not involving the second stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION (DYSPEPSIA, OR GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH).\r\n\r\nTympanites, already described, is a form of indigestion in which the chief\r\nsymptom and most threatening condition is the collection of gas in the\r\npaunch. This symptom does not always accompany indigestion, so it is well\r\nhere to consider other forms under a separate head. If indigestion is long\r\ncontinued, the irritant abnormal products developed cause catarrh of the\r\nstomach and intestines--gastrointestinal catarrh. On the other hand,\r\nhowever, irritant substances ingested may cause gastrointestinal catarrh,\r\nwhich, in turn, will cause indigestion; hence, it results that these\r\nseveral conditions are usually found existing together.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Irritant feed, damaged feed, overloading of the stomach, or\r\nsudden changes of diet may cause this disease. Want of exercise predisposes\r\nto it, or feed which is coarse and indigestible may after a time produce\r\nit. Feed which possesses astringent properties and tends to check secretion\r\nmay also act as an exciting cause. Feed in excessive quantity may lead to\r\ndisorder of digestion and to this disease. It is very likely to appear\r\ntoward the end of protracted seasons of drought; therefore a deficiency of\r\nwater must be regarded as one of the conditions which favor its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Diminished appetite, rumination irregular, tongue coated,\r\nmouth slimy, dung passed apparently not well digested and smelling bad,\r\ndullness, and fullness of the flanks. The disease may in some cases assume\r\na chronic character, and in addition to the foregoing symptoms slight\r\nbloating or tympanites of the left flank may be observed; the animal\r\nbreathes with effort and each respiration may be accompanied with a grunt,\r\nthe ears and horns are alternately hot and cold, rumination ceases, the\r\nusual rumbling sound in the stomach is not audible, the passage of dung is\r\nalmost entirely suspended, and the animal passes only a little mucus\r\noccasionally. Sometimes there is alternating constipation and diarrhea.\r\nThere is low fever in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe disease continues a few days or a week in the mild cases, while the\r\nsevere cases may last several weeks. In the latter form the emaciation and\r\nloss of strength may be very great. There is no appetite, no rumination,\r\nnor peristalsis. The mouth is hot and sticky, the eyes have receded in\r\ntheir sockets, and milk secretion has ceased. In such cases the outlook for\r\nrecovery is unfavorable. The patient falls away in flesh and becomes\r\nweaker, as is shown by the fact that one frequently finds it lying down.\r\n\r\nOn examining animals which have died of this disease it is found that the\r\nlining membrane of the fourth stomach and the intestines, particularly the\r\nsmall intestine, is red, swollen, streaked with deeper red or bluish lines,\r\nor spotted. The lining of the first three stomachs is more or less\r\nsoftened, and may easily be peeled off. The third stomach (psalter)\r\ncontains dry feed in hard masses closely adherent to its walls.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the brain appears to become disordered, probably from the\r\npain and weakness and from the absorption of toxins generated in the\r\ndigestive canal. In such cases there is weakness and an unsteady gait, the\r\nanimal does not appear to take notice of and will consequently run against\r\nobstacles; after a time it falls and gives up to violent and disordered\r\nmovements. This delirious condition is succeeded by coma or stupor, and\r\ndeath ensues.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Small quantities of roots, sweet silage, or selected grass or\r\nhay should be offered several times daily. Very little feed should be\r\nallowed. Aromatic and demulcent drafts may be given to produce a soothing\r\neffect on the mucous lining of the stomachs and to promote digestion. Two\r\nounces of camomile flowers should be boiled for 20 minutes in a quart of\r\nwater and the infusion on cooling should be given to the affected animal.\r\nThis may be repeated three or four times a day. When constipation is\r\npresent the following purgative may be administered: One pound of Glauber's\r\nsalt dissolved in a quart of linseed tea and a pint of molasses. After this\r\npurgative has acted, if there is a lack of appetite and the animal does not\r\nruminate regularly, the powder mentioned in remarks on the treatment of\r\nchronic tympanites may be given according to directions. The diet must be\r\nrather laxative and of an easily digestible character after an attack of\r\nthis form of indigestion. Feed should be given in moderate quantities, as\r\nexcess by overtaxing the digestive functions may bring on a relapse.\r\nIce-cold water should be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION FROM DRINKING COLD WATER (COLIC).\r\n\r\nThis disorder is produced by drinking copiously of cold water, which\r\narrests digestion and produces cramp of the fourth stomach, probably of the\r\nother stomachs, and also of the bowels.\r\n\r\n_Causes._---It is not customary for the ox to drink much water at once. In\r\nfact, he usually drinks slowly and as if he were merely tasting the water,\r\nletting some fall out at the corners of his mouth at every mouthful. It\r\nwould therefore seem to be contrary to the habits of the ox to drink\r\ncopiously; but we find that during hot weather, when he has been working\r\nand is consequently very thirsty, if he drinks a large quantity of cold\r\nwater he may be immediately taken with a very severe colic. Cows which are\r\nfed largely on dry hay drink copiously, like the working ox, and become\r\naffected in precisely the same manner. In such cases they are seized with a\r\nchill or fit of trembling before the cramps come on.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is some distension of the abdomen, but no accumulation\r\nof gas. As the distension and pain occur immediately after the animal has\r\ndrunk the water, there can be no doubt as to the exciting cause.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Walk the animal about for 10 minutes before administering\r\nmedicine, and this allows time for a portion of the contents of the stomach\r\nto pass into the bowel, and renders it safer to give medicine. In many\r\ncases the walking exercise and the diarrhea bring about a spontaneous cure\r\nof this disorder, but as in some instances the cramps and pains of the\r\nstomachs persist, one may give 1 ounce of sulphuric ether and 1 ounce of\r\ntincture of opium, shaken up with a pint of warm water, and repeat the dose\r\nin half an hour if the animal is not relieved. In an emergency when the\r\nmedicine is not to be had, a tablespoonful of powdered ginger may be\r\nadministered in a pint of warm water.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION IN CALVES (GASTROINTESTINAL CATARRH, DIARRHEA, OR SCOUR).\r\n\r\nCalves are subject to a form of diarrhea to which the foregoing\r\ndesignations have been applied.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Calves that suck their dams are not frequently affected with\r\nthis disease, though it may be occasioned by their sucking at long\r\nintervals and thus overloading the stomach and bringing on indigestion,\r\nor from improper feeding of the dam on soft, watery, or damaged feeds.\r\nSuckling the calf at irregular times may also cause it. Exposure to damp\r\nand cold is a potent predisposing cause. Calves separated from their dams\r\nand fed considerable quantities of cold milk at long intervals are liable\r\nto contract this form of indigestion. Calves fed on artificial feed, used\r\nas a substitute for milk, frequently contract it. Damaged feed, sour or\r\nrotten milk, milk from dirty cans, skim milk from a dirty creamery\r\nskim-milk vat, skim milk hauled warm, exposed to the sun and fed from\r\nunclean buckets may all cause this disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The calf is depressed; appetite is poor; sometimes there is\r\nfever; the extremities are cold. The dung becomes gradually softer and\r\nlighter in color until it is cream colored and little thicker than milk. It\r\nhas a most offensive odor and may contain clumps of curd. Later it contains\r\nmucus and gas bubbles. It sticks to the hair of the tail and buttocks,\r\ncausing the hair to drop off and the skin to become irritated. There may be\r\npain on passing dung and also abdominal or colicky pain. The calf stands\r\nabout with the back arched and belly contracted. There may be tympanites.\r\nGreat weakness ensues in severe cases, and without prompt and successful\r\ntreatment death soon follows.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Remove the cause. Give appropriate feed of best quality in\r\nsmall quantities. Make sure that the cow furnishing the milk is healthy and\r\nis properly fed. Clean all milk vessels. Clean and disinfect the stalls.\r\nFor the diarrhea give two raw eggs or a cup of strong coffee. If the case\r\nis severe, give 1 ounce of castor oil with a teaspoonful of creolin and 20\r\ngrains of subnitrate of bismuth. Repeat the bismuth and creolin with\r\nflaxseed tea every four hours. Tannopin may be used in doses of 15 to 30\r\ngrains.\r\n\r\nCalves artificially fed on whole or skim milk should receive only such milk\r\nas is sweet and has been handled in a sanitary manner. Milk should always\r\nbe warmed to the temperature of the body before feeding. When calves\r\nartificially milk-fed develop diarrhea, the use of the following treatment\r\nhas given excellent results in many cases: Immediately after milking, or\r\nthe separation of the skim milk from the cream, formalin in the proportion\r\nof 1 to 4,000 should be added to the milk which is used for feeding; this\r\nmay be closely approximated by adding four drops of formalin to each quart\r\nof milk. This medicated milk should be fed to the calf in the usual\r\nquantity. When the diarrhea is not controlled in three or four days by this\r\ntreatment, the additional use of some of the agents recommended above may\r\nassist in a recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS DIARRHEA; WHITE SCOUR.\r\n\r\n[See chapter on Diseases of young calves, p. 247.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGASTROENTERITIS.\r\n\r\nThis consists of an inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and of the\r\nbowel.\r\n\r\nGastroenteritis, or inflammation of the walls of the stomachs and\r\nintestines, follows upon irritations more severe or longer continued than\r\nthose that produce gastrointestinal catarrh.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Severe indigestion may be followed by gastroenteritis, or it may\r\nbe caused by swallowing irritant poisons, such as arsenic or corrosive\r\nsublimate or irritant plants. Exposure to cold or inclement weather may\r\nproduce the disease, especially in debilitated animals or animals fed\r\nimproperly. It is asserted that if cattle feed on vegetation infested with\r\nsome kinds of caterpillars this disease may result.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Dullness; drooping of the ears; dryness of the muzzle; dry\r\nskin; staring coat; loins morbidly sensitive to pressure; fullness of the\r\nleft flank, which is caused by the distention of the fourth stomach by gas.\r\nThe pulse is small, the gait is feeble and staggering; each step taken is\r\naccompanied with a grunt, and this symptom is especially marked if the\r\nanimal walks in a downward direction. There is loss of appetite, and\r\nrumination is suspended. The passages at first are few in number, hard, and\r\nare sometimes coated with mucus or with blood. Later a severe diarrhea sets\r\nin, when the passages contain mucus and blood and have an offensive odor.\r\nThere is evidence of colicky pain, and the abdomen is sensitive to\r\npressure. Pain may be continuous. There is fever and acceleration of pulse\r\nrate and respirations. Mental depression and even insensibility occur\r\nbefore death. The disease is always severe and often fatal.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem appearances._--The mucous membrane of the fourth stomach has a\r\nwell-marked red color and sometimes presents ulcerations. The wall is\r\nthickened and softened, and similar conditions are found in the walls of\r\nthe intestines. The red discoloration extends in spots or large areas quite\r\nthrough the wall, showing on the outside.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Very small quantities of carefully selected feed must be\r\ngiven and the appetite must not be forced. Protect the animal well from\r\ncold and dampness. Internally, give linseed tea, boiled milk, boiled\r\noatmeal gruel, or rice water. These protectives may carry the medicine.\r\nTannopin in doses of 30 to 60 grains is good. Subnitrate of bismuth in\r\ndoses of 1 to 2 drams may be given. Pulverized opium may be used, if the\r\ndiarrhea is severe, in 1 to 2 dram doses. If the bowel movements are not\r\nfree, one may give from a pint to a quart of castor or raw linseed oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAUMATIC INFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\nThis disease results from the presence of a foreign body. This condition is\r\nnot rare in cattle, because these animals have the habit of swallowing\r\ntheir feed without careful chewing, and so nails, screws, hairpins, ends of\r\nwire, and other metal objects may be swallowed unconsciously. Such objects\r\ngravitate to the second stomach, where they may be caught in the folds of\r\nthe lining mucous membrane, and in some instances the wall of this organ is\r\nperforated. From this accident, chronic indigestion results. The symptoms,\r\nmore or less characteristic, are pain when getting up or lying down;\r\ngrunting and pain upon sudden motion, especially downhill; coughing; pain\r\non pressure over the second stomach, which lies immediately above the\r\ncartilaginous prolongation of the sternum. If the presence of such a\r\nforeign body is recognized, it may be removed by a difficult surgical\r\noperation, or, as is usually most economical, the animal may be killed for\r\nbeef, if there is no fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE BOWELS.\r\n\r\nDIARRHEA AND DYSENTERY.\r\n\r\n[See also Gastrointestinal catarrh, p. 32.]\r\n\r\nThe word \"dysentery,\" as it is commonly used in relation to the diseases of\r\nanimals, signifies a severe form of diarrhea.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Diarrhea is a symptom of irritation of the intestines, resulting\r\nin increased secretion or increased muscular contractions, or both. The\r\nirritation is sometimes the result of chilling from exposure, improper\r\nfeeding, irritant feeds, indigestion, organic diseases of the intestines,\r\nor parasites.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Passages from the bowels are frequent, at first consisting of\r\nthin dung, but as the disease continues they become watery and offensive\r\nsmelling, and may be even streaked with blood. At first the animal shows no\r\nconstitutional disturbance, but later it becomes weak and may exhibit\r\nevidence of abdominal pain by looking around to the side, drawing the feet\r\ntogether, lying down, or moving restlessly. Sometimes this malady is\r\naccompanied with fever, great depression, loss of strength, rapid loss of\r\nflesh, and it may terminate in death.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the disease depends on irritating properties of the feed\r\nwhich has been supplied to the animal, it is advisable to give a mild\r\npurgative, such as a pint of castor or linseed oil. When the secretions of\r\nthe bowels are irritating, an ounce of carbonate of magnesia and half an\r\nounce of tincture of opium should be shaken up in a quart of linseed tea\r\nand given to the animal three times a day until the passages present a\r\nnatural appearance. When there is debility, want of appetite, no fever, but\r\na continuance of the watery discharges from the bowels, then an astringent\r\nmay be given. For such cases the following is serviceable: Tannic acid, 1\r\nounce; powdered gentian, 2 ounces; mix and divide into 12 powders, one\r\npowder to be given three times a day until the passages present a natural\r\nappearance. Each powder may be mixed with a pint and a half of water.\r\nTannopin is a new remedy that is most useful in such cases. The dose is\r\nfrom 30 grains to 2 drams. Useful household remedies are raw eggs, strong\r\ncoffee, parched rye flour, or decoction of oak bark. In all cases the food\r\nmust be given sparingly, and it should be carefully selected to insure good\r\nquality. Complete rest in a box stall is desirable. When diarrhea is a\r\nsymptom of a malady characterized by the presence of a blood poison, the\r\ntreatment appropriate to such disease must be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE ENTERITIS.\r\n\r\n[See Gastroenteritis, p. 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCROUPOUS ENTERITIS.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions, severe irritation of the digestive canal may, in\r\ncattle, cause a form of inflammation of the intestines (enteritis) that is\r\ncharacterized by the formation of a false membrane upon the surface of the\r\nlining membrane of the intestines, particularly the large ones.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is fever, depression, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and in\r\nthe fecal masses shreds of leathery false membrane may be found. These\r\nshreds are sometimes mistaken for parasites or for portions of the wall of\r\nthe intestine.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give a pound of Glauber's salt, followed by bicarbonate of\r\nsoda in doses of 2 ounces four times daily.\r\n\r\nENTERITIS (OBSTRUCTION RESULTING FROM INVAGINATION, OR INTUSSUSCEPTION,\r\nTWISTING, AND KNOTTING OF THE BOWELS).\r\n\r\nInflammation may arise from a knot forming on some part of the small\r\nintestine from the portion of the bowel becoming twisted on itself, or from\r\none part of the bowel slipping into another, which is termed invagination.\r\nThis form of enteritis occurs occasionally in animals of the bovine\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The small intestine, which in the ox rests on the right side of\r\nthe rumen, is, from the position which it occupies, predisposed to this\r\naccident. It has been ascertained that animals which have shown symptoms of\r\nthis malady have trotted, galloped, or made other violent exertions in\r\ncoming from drinking, or that they have been chased by dogs or by animals\r\nof their own species while at pasture. The accident is most likely to occur\r\namong cattle on very hilly pastures. The danger of jumping or running is\r\ngreatest when the rumen is distended with food.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This form of enteritis or obstruction is manifested by severe\r\ncolicky pains; the ox scrapes and strikes the ground with his front and\r\nhind feet alternately; keeps lying down and getting up again; he keeps his\r\ntail constantly raised and turns his nose frequently to his right flank; he\r\nis frequently bloated, or tympanitic, on that side. He refuses feed and\r\ndoes not ruminate, and for some hours suffers severe pains. At first he\r\nfrequently passes thin dung, and also urinates frequently, but passes only\r\na little urine at a time. On the second day the pains have become less\r\nacute; the animal remains lying down; moans occasionally; his pulse is\r\nsmall and quick; he still refuses feed and does not ruminate. At this stage\r\nhe does not pass any dung, though sometimes a small quantity of bloody\r\nmucus may be passed. The animal passes very little urine. This condition\r\nmay continue for a considerable time, as cattle so affected may live for 15\r\nor even 20 days.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem appearance._--At death the bowels are found to be misplaced or\r\nobstructed, as mentioned above, and inflamed, the inflammation always\r\noriginating at the point where the intestine has been invaginated, twisted,\r\nor knotted. Sometimes the part is gangrenous, the compression of the blood\r\nvessels preventing circulation, and thus causing the death of the tissues.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Purgatives, anodynes, and other remedies are of no service in\r\nsuch cases, and bleeding also fails to produce any benefit. Indeed, it is\r\nusually true that in such cases treatment is useless. Some cases are\r\nrecorded in which an incision has been made in the flank, so as to enable\r\nthe operator to restore the intestine to its normal position or to remove\r\nthe kink.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nConstipation is to be regarded rather as a symptom of disease or of faults\r\nin feeding than as a disease in itself. It occurs in almost all general\r\nfevers unless the bowels are involved in local disease, in obstructions of\r\nall kinds, from feeding on dry, bulky feed, etc. In order to remove the\r\nconstipation the treatment must be applied to remove the causes which give\r\nrise to it. Calves sometimes suffer from constipation immediately after\r\nbirth when the meconium that accumulates in the bowels before birth is not\r\npassed. In such cases, give a rectal injection of warm water and an ounce\r\nof castor oil shaken up with an ounce of new milk. The mother's milk is the\r\nbest food to prevent constipation in the new-born calf, as it contains a\r\nlarge amount of fatty matter which renders it laxative in its effects.\r\n\r\nIt is usually better to treat habitual constipation by a change of diet\r\nthan by medicine. Flaxseed is a good feed laxative. If the constipation has\r\nlasted long, repeated small doses of purgatives are better than a single\r\nlarge dose.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS.\r\n\r\n[See chapter on \"The animal parasites of cattle,\" p. 502.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURES (VENTRAL HERNIA).\r\n\r\nVentral hernia, or rupture, is an escape of some one of the abdominal\r\norgans through a rupture in the abdominal muscles, the skin remaining\r\nintact. The rumen, the small intestine, or part of the large intestine, and\r\nthe fourth stomach are the parts which usually form a ventral hernia in\r\nbovine animals.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Hernia is frequently produced by blows of the horns, kicks, and\r\nfalls. In old cows hernia may sometimes occur without any direct injury.\r\n\r\nHERNIA OF THE RUMEN.--Hernia of the rumen is generally situated on the left\r\nside of the abdomen, on account of the situation of the rumen. In\r\nexceptional cases it may take place on the right side, and in such cases it\r\nalso generally happens that some folds of the intestine pass into the\r\nhernial sac. Hernias have been classified into simple or complicated,\r\nrecent or old, traumatic (from mechanical injury) or spontaneous.\r\n\r\nIn recent traumatic hernia there is swelling on the left side of the lower\r\npart of the abdomen. The swelling is greatest in the cases of hernia which\r\nare situated on the lower part of the abdomen. Unless an examination is\r\nmade immediately after the injury has been inflicted it is difficult, and\r\nsometimes impossible, to ascertain the exact extent of the rupture, owing\r\nto the swelling which subsequently takes place. Frequently there is no loss\r\nof appetite, fever, or other general symptoms attending the injury. From\r\nthe twelfth to the fifteenth day the swelling has generally subsided to\r\nsuch an extent that it is possible by an examination to determine the\r\nextent of the rupture.\r\n\r\nIn old cows what is termed spontaneous hernia may sometimes take place\r\nwithout any direct injury. The occurrence of this form of hernia is\r\nexplained by the increase in the size of the abdomen, which takes place in\r\nan advanced stage of pregnancy, causing a thinning and stretching of the\r\nmuscular fibers, which at last may rupture, or give way. Such hernias\r\nfrequently occur about the end of the period of gestation, and in some\r\ninstances have contained the right sac of the rumen, the omentum, the small\r\nand large intestines, a portion of the liver, and the pregnant uterus.\r\n\r\nIn old hernias the swelling is soft and elastic, and if they have not\r\ncontracted adhesions to the sides of the laceration, they can be made to\r\ndisappear by pressure carefully applied. Sometimes this accident is\r\ncomplicated by a rupture of the rumen, constituting a complicated hernia.\r\nIf a portion of the contents of the rumen escape into the abdomen, the case\r\nwill be aggravated by the occurrence of peritonitis.\r\n\r\nHERNIA OF THE BOWEL.--When the intestines (Pl. III, fig. 6) form the\r\ncontents of the hernia, it will be situated at the right side of the\r\nabdomen. In an intestinal hernia the swelling is usually not painful, of a\r\ndoughy consistence or elastic, according as the intestine does or does not\r\ncontain alimentary matter. This swelling can generally be made to disappear\r\nby pressure, and when it has been reduced one can easily recognize the\r\ndirection and extent of the hernial opening. Hernias of the bowel which are\r\nsituated at the upper and right side of the abdomen are usually formed by\r\nthe small intestine. They are less easily reduced than a hernia in a lower\r\nsituation, but when reduction has been effected they are less readily\r\nreproduced than those occurring lower. In hernias of the small intestine,\r\nadhesion of the protruding parts to the walls of the opening, or\r\nstrangulation, are complications which sometimes take place. If adhesion\r\nhas taken place the hernia can not be reduced by pressure, and when\r\nstrangulation has occurred the animal shows symptoms of pain--is restless,\r\nturns its nose to the painful part, and shows those symptoms which are\r\nusually collectively designated under the term colic. If relief is not\r\nafforded, the animal will die.\r\n\r\nHERNIA OF THE RENNET, OR FOURTH STOMACH.--This disease occasionally occurs\r\nin calves and is usually caused by a blow from a cow's horn on the right\r\nflank of the calf. After such an accident a swelling forms on the right\r\nflank near the last rib. This swelling may be neither hot nor painful, even\r\nat first, and is soft to the touch. It can be made to disappear by careful\r\npressure, when the sides of the aperture through which it has passed can be\r\nfelt. The application of pressure so as to cause the disappearance of the\r\nhernia is best made immediately after the occurrence of the accident, or\r\nwhen the edema which accompanies the swelling has disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When a hernia is reducible--that is, can be pushed back into\r\nthe abdomen--then, if it is of recent occurrence, it is advisable to\r\nmaintain the natural position of the parts by bandaging and to allow the\r\nwalls of the laceration to grow together. The bowels should be kept\r\nreasonably empty by avoiding the use of bulky feed, and the animal must be\r\nkept quiet.\r\n\r\nThe following method of bandaging is recommended by Bouley:\r\n\r\nFirst prepare a bandage (must be of strong material), about 10 yards long\r\nand between 3 and 4 inches broad, and a flexible and solid piece of\r\npasteboard adapted in size to the surface of the hernia. The protruding\r\norgan must then be replaced in the abdomen and maintained in that position\r\nduring the application of the bandage. This being done, a layer of melted\r\npitch and turpentine is quickly spread on the skin covering the seat of the\r\nhernia, so as to extend somewhat beyond that space. This adhesive layer is\r\nthen covered with a layer of fine tow, then a new layer of pitch and\r\nturpentine is spread on the tow, and the piece of pasteboard is applied on\r\nthe layer of pitch, its outer surface being covered with the same\r\npreparation. Lastly, the bandage, adhering to the piece of pasteboard, to\r\nthe skin, and to the different turns which it makes around the body, is\r\ncarefully applied so as to form an immovable, rigid, and solid bandage,\r\nwhich will retain the hernia long enough for the wound in the abdominal\r\nwalls to heal permanently.\r\n\r\nIf the hernia is old and small it may be treated by injecting a strong\r\nsolution of common salt about the edges of the tear. This causes swelling\r\nand inflammation, which, respectively, forces the protruded organ back and\r\ncloses the opening. There is some risk attached to this method of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nIn small, old, ventral hernias the method of compressing and sloughing off\r\nthe skin has been used successfully. If the hernia is large a radical\r\noperation will be necessary, and this is also true when the symptoms\r\nindicate that a hernia is strangulated. This operation is performed by\r\ncutting down on the hernia, restoring the organ to the abdominal cavity,\r\nand then closing the wound with two sets of stitches; the inner stitches,\r\nin the muscular wall, should be made with catgut and the outer stitches, in\r\nthe skin, may be made with silk or silver wire. The strictest surgical\r\ncleanliness must be observed. Bleeding vessels should be tied. Then a\r\ncompress composed of ten or twelve folds of cloth must be placed smoothly\r\nover the seat of injury and a bandage applied around the body, the two ends\r\nbeing fastened at the back. In the smaller kinds of hernia, nitric acid may\r\nsometimes be applied with success. This treatment should not be applied\r\nuntil the swelling and inflammation attending the appearance of the hernia\r\nhave subsided; then, the contents of the hernia having been returned, the\r\nsurface of skin corresponding to it is sponged over with a solution\r\ncomposed of 1 part of nitric acid to 2 of water. This treatment acts by\r\nexciting considerable inflammation, which has the effect of causing\r\nswelling, and thus frequently closing the hernial opening and preventing\r\nthe contents of the sac from returning. A second application should not be\r\nmade until the inflammation excited by the first has subsided. In what is\r\ntermed spontaneous hernia it is useless to apply any kind of treatment.\r\n\r\nUMBILICAL HERNIA.--The umbilicus, or navel, is the aperture through which\r\nthe blood vessels pass from the mother to the fetus, and naturally the\r\nsides of this aperture ought to adhere or unite after birth. In very young\r\nanimals, and sometimes in newborn calves, this aperture in the abdominal\r\nmuscles remains open and a part of the bowel or a portion of the mesentery\r\nmay slip through the opening, constituting what is called umbilical hernia.\r\nThe wall of the sac is formed by the skin, which is covered on the inner\r\nsurface by a layer of cellular tissue, and within this there is sometimes,\r\nbut not always, a layer of peritoneum. The contents of the hernia may be\r\nformed by a part of the bowel, by a portion of the peritoneum, or may\r\ncontain portions of both peritoneum and bowel. When the sac contains only\r\nthe peritoneum it has a doughy feel, but when it is formed by a portion of\r\nthe bowel it is more elastic on pressure.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--In the new-born animal the opening of the navel is generally\r\nlarge, and may sometimes give way to the pressure of the bowel on account\r\nof the weak and relaxed condition of the abdominal muscles. This defective\r\nand abnormal condition of the umbilicus is frequently hereditary. It may be\r\noccasioned by roughly pulling away the umbilical cord; through kicks or\r\nblows on the belly; through any severe straining by which the sides of the\r\nnavel are stretched apart. We may mention in this connection that it is\r\nbest in new-born calves to tie the umbilical cord tightly about 2 inches\r\nfrom the navel, and then to leave it alone, when in most cases it will drop\r\noff in a few days, leaving the navel closed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--It is well to bear in mind that many, and especially the\r\nsmaller, umbilical hernias heal spontaneously; that is, nature effects a\r\ncure. As the animal gets older the abdominal muscles get stronger and\r\npossess more power of resistance to pressure, the bowels become larger and\r\ndo not pass so readily through a small opening, so that from a combination\r\nof causes there is a gradual growing together or adhesion of the sides of\r\nthe navel. In cases of umbilical hernia in which there are no indications\r\nthat a spontaneous cure will take place, the calf should be laid on its\r\nback; immediately on this being done the hernia will often disappear into\r\nthe abdomen. If it does not, its reduction may be brought about by gentle\r\nhandling, endeavoring, if need be, to empty the organs forming the hernia\r\nbefore returning them into the abdomen. After the hernia has been returned,\r\nthe hair should be clipped from the skin covering it and a compress\r\ncomposed of 10 or 12 folds of linen or cotton should be applied, first\r\nsmearing the skin with pitch and then a bandage about 3 inches wide should\r\nbe passed round the body so as to retain the compress in position. The\r\nlower part of the compress should be smeared with pitch, and also those\r\nportions of the bandage which pass over it, so as to keep it solid and\r\nprevent it from shifting. In some cases it will be found that the contents\r\nof the sac can not be returned into the abdomen, and this generally arises\r\nfrom the fact that some part of the contents of the sac has grown to or\r\nbecome adherent to the edges of the umbilical opening. In such a case the\r\nskin must be carefully laid open in the long direction, the adhesions of\r\nthe protruding organs carefully separated from the umbilicus, and after the\r\nprotruding parts have been returned into the abdomen, the sides of the\r\numbilicus must be freshened if necessary by paring, and then the edges of\r\nthe opening brought together by catgut stitches; the wound in the skin must\r\nthen also be brought together by stitches. The wound must be carefully\r\ndressed every day and a bandage passed round the body so as to cover and\r\nprotect the part operated on.\r\n\r\nIn small hernias nitric acid has been used successfully in the same manner\r\nas has been described in the treatment of ventral hernia. Sulphuric acid\r\nhas also been used for a similar purpose, diluting it to the extent of 1\r\npart of acid to 3 or 5 of water. In thin-skinned animals the weaker\r\npreparations ought to be preferred, and caution must be exercised in using\r\nsuch preparations so as not to destroy the tissues on which they are\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nAnother method of treatment is, after the contents of the sac have been\r\nreturned into the abdomen, to tie a piece of strong waxed cord round the\r\npendulous portion which formed the outer covering of the hernia. The string\r\nis apt to slacken after two or three days, when a new piece of cord should\r\nbe applied above the first one. The constriction of the skin sets up\r\ninflammation, which generally extends to the umbilicus and causes the edges\r\nto adhere together, and by the time the portion of skin below the ligature\r\nhas lost its vitality and dropped off, the umbilicus is closed and there is\r\nno danger of the abdominal organs protruding through it. This is what takes\r\nplace when this method has a favorable result, though if the umbilicus does\r\nnot become adherent and the skin sloughs, the bowels will protrude through\r\nthe opening.\r\n\r\nGUT-TIE (PERITONEAL HERNIA).--In peritoneal hernia of the ox a loop or\r\nknuckle of intestine enters from the abdomen into a rent in that part of\r\nthe peritoneum which is situated at the margin of the hip bone or it passes\r\nunder the remains of the spermatic cord, the end of which may be grown fast\r\nto the inner inguinal ring. The onward pressure of the bowel, as well as\r\nthe occasional turning of the latter round the spermatic cord, is the cause\r\nof the cord exercising considerable pressure on the bowel, which occasions\r\nirritation, obstructs the passage of excrement, and excites inflammation,\r\nwhich terminates in gangrene and death.\r\n\r\nThe rent in the peritoneum is situated at the upper and front part of the\r\npelvis, nearer to the sacrum than the pubes.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Among the causes of peritoneal hernia considerable importance is\r\nattached to a method of castration which is practiced in certain districts,\r\nviz, the tearing or rupturing of the spermatic cord by main force instead\r\nof dividing it at a proper distance above the testicle in a surgical\r\nmanner. After this violent and rough method of operating, the cord retracts\r\ninto the abdomen and its stump becomes adherent to some part of the\r\nperitoneum, or it may wind around the bowel and then the stump becomes\r\nadherent, so that strangulation of the bowel results. The rough dragging on\r\nthe cord may also cause a tear in the peritoneum, the result of which need\r\nnot be described. The severe exertion of ascending hills and mountains,\r\ndrawing heavy loads, or the straining which oxen undergo while fighting\r\neach other may also give rise to peritoneal hernia.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The ox suddenly becomes very restless, stamps with his feet,\r\nmoves backward and forward, hurriedly lies down, rises, moves his tail\r\nuneasily, and kicks at his belly with the foot of the affected side. The\r\npain evinced may diminish but soon returns again. In the early stage there\r\nare frequent passages of dung, but after the lapse of 18 or 24 hours this\r\nceases, the bowel apparently being emptied to the point of strangulation,\r\nand the passages now consist only of a little mucus mixed with blood. When\r\ninjections are given at this time the water passes out of the bowel without\r\neven being colored. The animal lies down on the side where the hernia\r\nexists and stretches out his hind feet in a backward direction. These two\r\nparticular symptoms serve to distinguish this affection from enteritis and\r\ninvagination of the bowel. As time passes the animal becomes quieter, but\r\nthis cessation of pain may indicate that gangrene of the bowel has set in,\r\nand may, therefore, under certain circumstances, be considered a precursor\r\nof death. Gangrene may take place in from four to six days, when\r\nperforation of the bowel may occur and death result in a short time.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the first place the ox should be examined by passing the\r\noiled hand and arm into the rectum; the hand should be passed along the\r\nmargin of the pelvis, beginning at the sacrum and continuing downward\r\ntoward the inguinal ring, when a soft, painful swelling will be felt, which\r\nmay vary from the size of an apple to that of the two fists. This swelling\r\nwill be felt to be tightly compressed by the spermatic cord. It very rarely\r\nhappens that there is any similar swelling on the left side, though in such\r\ncases it is best to make a thorough examination. The bowel has sometimes\r\nbeen released from its position by driving the ox down a hill; by causing\r\nhim to jump from a height of 2 feet to the ground; the expedient of\r\ntrotting him also has been resorted to with the hope that the jolting\r\nmovement might bring about a release of the bowel. If the simple expedients\r\nmentioned have been tried and failed, then the hand being passed into the\r\nrectum should be pressed gently on the swelling in an upward and forward\r\ndirection, so as to endeavor to push the imprisoned portion of the bowel\r\nback into the abdomen. While this is being done the ox's hind feet should\r\nstand on higher ground than the front, so as to favor the slipping out of\r\nthe bowel by its own weight, and at the same time an assistant should\r\nsqueeze the animal's loins, so as to cause it to bend downward and so relax\r\nthe band formed by the spermatic cord. If the imprisoned portion of gut is\r\nfreed, which may be ascertained by the disappearance of the swelling, the\r\nusual sounds produced by the bowels moving in the abdomen will be heard,\r\nand in a few hours the feces and urine will be passed as usual. If the\r\nmeans mentioned fail to release the imprisoned portion of the gut, then\r\nan incision about 4 inches long must be made in the right flank in a\r\ndownward direction, the hand introduced into the abdomen, the situation\r\nand condition of swelling exactly ascertained, and then a probe-pointed\r\nknife inserted between the imprisoned bowel and band compressing it, and\r\nturned outward against the band, the latter being then cautiously divided\r\nand the imprisoned gut allowed to escape, or, if necessary, the bowel\r\nshould be drawn gently from its position into the abdomen. The wound in the\r\nflank must be brought together in the same way as in the case of the wound\r\nmade in operating for impaction of the rumen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE ABDOMEN.\r\n\r\nA wound of the abdomen may merely penetrate the skin; but as such cases are\r\nnot attended with much danger, nor their treatment with much difficulty, we\r\nwill consider here merely those wounds which penetrate the entire thickness\r\nof the abdominal walls and expose to a greater or less extent the organs\r\ncontained in that cavity.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Such accidents may be occasioned by falling on fragments of\r\nbroken glass or other sharp objects. A blow from the horn of another animal\r\nmay penetrate the abdomen. Exposure and protrusion of some of the abdominal\r\norgans may also be occasioned by the incautious use of caustics in the\r\ntreatment of umbilical or ventral hernia. The parts which generally escape\r\nthrough an abdominal wound are the small intestine and floating colon.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When the abdominal wound is small, the bowel exposed presents\r\nthe appearance of a small round tumor, but in a few moments a loop of\r\nintestine may emerge from the opening. The animal then shows symptoms of\r\nsevere pain by pawing with his feet, which has the effect of accelerating\r\nthe passage of new loops of intestine through the wound, so that the mass\r\nwhich they form may even touch the ground. The pain becomes so great that\r\nthe ox now not only paws but lies down and rolls, thus tearing and crushing\r\nhis bowels. In such cases it is best to slaughter the animal at once; but\r\nin the case of a valuable animal in which tearing and crushing of the\r\nbowels has not taken place the bowels should be washed with freshly boiled\r\nwater reduced to the temperature of the body and returned and the wounds in\r\nthe muscle and skin brought together in a manner somewhat similar to that\r\ndescribed in speaking of ventral hernia.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE LIVER AND SPLEEN.\r\n\r\nJAUNDICE (THE YELLOWS, OR CONGESTION OF THE LIVER).\r\n\r\nWhen jaundice exists, there is a yellow appearance of the white of the eyes\r\nand of the mucous membrane of the mouth. A similar aspect of the skin may\r\nalso be observed in animals which are either partly or altogether covered\r\nwith white hair. Jaundice is then merely a symptom of disease and ought to\r\ndirect attention to ascertaining, if possible, the cause or causes which\r\nhave given rise to it. A swollen condition of the mucous membrane of that\r\npart of the bowel called the duodenum may produce jaundice, as that\r\nmechanically closes the orifice of the biliary duct. In constipation there\r\nis an inactive or torpid condition of the bowel, and the bile which passes\r\ninto the intestine may be absorbed and cause the yellow staining of\r\njaundice. Jaundice is one of the symptoms of Texas fever. It may also arise\r\nfrom the presence of parasites or gallstones in the ducts, forming a\r\nmechanical obstruction to the onward flow of bile. The conditions under\r\nwhich jaundice most commonly calls for treatment are when cattle have been\r\nhighly fed and kept in a state of inactivity. At such time there is an\r\nexcess of nutritive elements carried into the blood, which is associated\r\nwith increased fullness of the portal vein and hepatic artery. When\r\ncontinued high feeding has produced this congested state of the liver, the\r\nfunctions of that organ become disordered, so that a considerable portion\r\nof the bile, instead of being excreted and passing into the intestine, is\r\nabsorbed by the hepatic veins.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the liver is shown in Plate IV.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This disease, although rare, occurs most frequently among\r\nstall-fed cattle. Pressure along the margin of the short ribs on the right\r\nside produces pain; the appetite is poor and the animal shows hardly any\r\ninclination to drink; the mucous membranes of the eye and mouth are yellow,\r\nthe urine has a yellow or brown appearance, the animal lies down much and\r\nmoves with reluctance, moans occasionally, and has a tottering gait. The\r\nears and horns are alternately hot and cold; in cows the secretion of milk\r\nis much diminished, and that which is secreted has a bitter taste;\r\nsometimes the animal has a dry, painful cough and presents a dull,\r\nstupefied appearance.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In such cases it is advisable to produce a free action of the\r\nbowels, so as to remove the usually congested condition of the portal vein\r\nand liver. For this purpose the administration of the following dose is\r\nrecommended: Sulphate of soda, 16 ounces; molasses, 1 pint; warm water, 1\r\nquart. The sulphate of soda is dissolved by stirring it up in tepid water.\r\nFollowing this the animal should have a heaping tablespoonful of artificial\r\nCarlsbad salt in the feed three times daily. This treatment may be assisted\r\nby giving occasional injections of warm water and soap. The diet should be\r\nlaxative and moderate in quantity and may consist of coarse bran mash,\r\npulped roots, grass in the season, and hay in moderate quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEPATITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE LIVER).\r\n\r\nHepatitis is an inflammation of the liver and usually occurs as a\r\ncomplication of some infectious disease. It may also occur as a\r\ncomplication of gastrointestinal catarrh or in hot weather from overheating\r\nor damaged (putrid or fermented) feeds.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are sometimes obscure and their real significance\r\nis frequently overlooked. The most prominent symptoms are yellowness of the\r\nwhite of the eye and of the membrane lining the mouth; the appetite is\r\npoor, the body presents an emaciated appearance, the feces are light\r\ncolored, while the urine is likely to be unusually dark; there is thirst,\r\nand pain is caused by pressing over the liver. The gait is weak and the\r\nanimal lies down more than usual, and while doing so frequently rests its\r\nhead on the side of its chest.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give a purge of Glauber's salt and after it has operated give\r\nartificial Carlsbad salts in each feed, as advised under \"Jaundice.\" Give\r\ngreen feed and plenty of water. Oil of turpentine should be rubbed in well\r\nonce a day over the region of the liver. The skin on which it should be\r\napplied extends from the false ribs on the right side to 6 inches in front\r\nof the last one, and from the backbone to 12 inches on the right side of\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUKE DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[See chapter on \"The animal parasites of cattle,\" p. 502.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLENITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE SPLEEN).\r\n\r\nThis disease occurs almost solely as a result of the existence of some\r\ninfectious disease, and the symptoms caused by it merge with the symptoms\r\nof the accompanying causative disease. The spleen is seriously involved and\r\nbecomes enlarged and soft in Texas fever, anthrax, and blood poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE PERITONEUM.\r\n\r\nPERITONITIS.\r\n\r\nPeritonitis consists of an inflammation of the peritoneum, which is the\r\nthin, delicate membrane that lines the abdomen and covers the abdominal\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Wounds are the usual cause in cattle. The wound may be of the\r\nabdominal wall or of the intestines, stomach, or uterus; or inflammation\r\nmay extend from one of the organs of the abdominal cavity to the\r\nperitoneum; so this disease may complicate enteritis or inflamed womb. A\r\nsharp metal body may perforate the second stomach and allow the gastric\r\ncontents to escape, irritating the peritoneum. This disease may follow\r\ncastration or operation for hernia.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A continuous or occasional shivering; the animal lies down,\r\nbut appears uneasy; it frequently turns its head toward its belly and lows\r\nplaintively; pressure on the flanks produces pain; has no appetite; muzzle\r\nis dry and no rumination; while standing, its legs are placed well under\r\nits body; pulse small and hard. The evacuations from the bowels are dry and\r\nhard. If this disease is complicated by the presence of inflammation of the\r\nbowels, the pain is more severe and the animal is more restless. The skin\r\nis cold and dry in the early stage of this disease, but in a more advanced\r\nstage this condition may be succeeded by heat of the skin and quick\r\nbreathing. The fits of trembling, uneasiness, small and hard pulse, and\r\ntension of the left flank are symptoms the presence of which would enable\r\none to reach the conclusion that peritonitis exists.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem appearance._--The membrane lining the abdomen and covering the\r\nsurface of the bowels is reddened to a greater or less extent, and there is\r\nusually considerable serous, or watery, fluid collected in the abdomen.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When we have to do with the form of peritonitis resulting\r\nfrom an injury, as when the horn of another animal has been thrust through\r\nthe abdominal walls, this lesion must be treated in accordance with\r\ndirections before given, but the general treatment must be similar to that\r\nwhich follows. Peritonitis resulting from castration or from parturient\r\nfever must also be treated in connection with the special conditions which\r\ngive rise to it, as the general treatment of this disease must be modified\r\nto some extent by the exciting cause.\r\n\r\nThe aim must be to discover and remove the cause. The cause must be treated\r\naccording to its nature. Harms strongly recommends borax in the treatment\r\nof peritonitis. He gives 6 ounces in the first 24 hours, divided into three\r\ndoses, and afterwards he gives 6 drams three times daily. Opium in doses of\r\n2 to 3 drams may be given. To bring on evacuations of the bowels it is\r\nbetter to give rectal injections than to administer purges. The strength\r\nmay be sustained by coffee or camphor.\r\n\r\nThe body should be warmly clothed, and it is advisable, when practicable,\r\nto have a blanket which has been wrung out of hot water placed over the\r\nabdomen, then covered by several dry blankets, which are maintained in\r\nposition by straps or ropes passing round the body. The wet blanket must be\r\nchanged as it cools--the object of treatment being to warm the surface of\r\nthe body and to determine as much blood to the skin as possible. The diet\r\nshould consist of laxative food and drinks, such as linseed tea. If\r\nperitonitis assumes chronic form the diet should be nutritious, such as\r\nselected clover hay, linseed cake, grass, etc., and iodid of potassium\r\nshould be given three times a day in gram doses dissolved in a pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN (ASCITES).\r\n\r\nIn this disease there is a serous, or watery, effusion in the cavity of the\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--When old animals are fed on innutritious feed or when reduced by\r\ndisease, they become anemic; in other words, their blood becomes\r\nimpoverished and dropsy may follow. An innutritious and insufficient diet\r\nproduces the same effect in young animals. It is one of the results of\r\nperitonitis, and may also arise from acute or chronic inflammation of the\r\nliver, such as is of common occurrence when flukes are present in the liver\r\nin large numbers. Heart disease and chronic lung disease may be followed by\r\nascites. It is sometimes, in calves, a symptom of infestation with worms.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A gradual increase in the size of the abdomen at its lower\r\npart, while the flanks becomes hollow; pallor of the mucous membrane of the\r\nmouth and eye; weak and sluggish gait; want of appetite, and irregularity\r\nin ruminating. On percussion or tapping the surface of the abdomen with the\r\nfingers, a dull sound is produced. If the hand and arm are oiled and passed\r\ninto the rectum as far as possible, on moving the hand from one side to the\r\nother the fluctuation caused by the presence of fluid in the abdomen may be\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If possible the cause must be discovered and removed. The\r\ndiet should be nutritious, and in those cases in which we have merely to\r\ndeal with anemia (the bloodless state) arising from insufficient diet, the\r\nuse of tonics and diuretics, at the same time keeping the skin warm, may\r\nbring about a gradual absorption of the fluid contained in the abdomen. One\r\nof the following powders may be mixed with the animal's feed three times a\r\nday; or, if there is any uncertainty as to its being taken in that way, it\r\nshould be mixed with sirup, so as to form a paste, and smeared well back on\r\nthe animal's tongue with a flat wooden spoon: Carbonate of iron, 3 ounces;\r\npowdered gentian, 3 ounces; powdered nitrate of potassium, 3 ounces; mix\r\nand divide into 12 powders. The administration of purgatives which promote\r\na watery discharge from the mucous surface of the bowels also tends, by\r\ndiminishing the serum of the blood, to bring about absorption and a gradual\r\nremoval of the fluid contained in the abdomen. Large doses should not be\r\ngiven, but moderate ones should be administered morning and night, so as to\r\nproduce a laxative effect on the bowels for several days. To attain this\r\nend the following may be used: Sulphate of soda, 8 ounces; powdered ginger,\r\nhalf an ounce; to be mixed in 2 quarts of tepid water and given at one\r\ndose.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE ORGANS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.

The incompletely\r\nmasticated food passes down the esophagus, or gullet, into the first and\r\nsecond stomachs, in which a churning motion is kept up, carrying the food\r\nfrom side to side and from stomach to stomach. From the first stomach\r\nregurgitation takes place; that is, the food is returned through the gullet\r\nto the mouth to be more thoroughly chewed, and this constitutes what is\r\nknown as \"chewing the cud.\" From the second stomach the food passes into\r\nthe third, and from the third into the fourth, or true, stomach, and from\r\nthere into the intestines.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.

Clinical thermometer, 4/5 natural size. This is used to determine\r\nthe temperature of the animal body. The thermometer is passed into the\r\nrectum after having been moistened with a little saliva from the mouth, or\r\nafter having had a little oil or lard rubbed upon it to facilitate its\r\npassage. There it is allowed to remain two or three minutes, then\r\nwithdrawn, and the temperature read as in any ordinary thermometer. The\r\nclinical thermometer is made self-registering; that is, the mercury in the\r\nstem remains at the height to which it was forced by the heat of the body\r\nuntil it is shaken back into the bulb by taking hold of the upper portion\r\nof the instrument and giving it a short, sharp swing. The normal\r\ntemperature of cattle varies from 100∞ to 103∞ F. In young animals it is\r\nsomewhat higher than in old. The thermometer is a very useful instrument\r\nand frequently is the means by which disease is detected before the\r\nappearance of any external sign.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE I.

Microscopic anatomy of the liver. The liver is composed of\r\ninnumerable small lobules, from 1/20 to 1/10 inch in diameter. The lobules\r\nare held together by a small amount of fibrous tissue, in which the bile\r\nducts and larger blood vessels are lodged.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 Illustrates the structure of a lobule; _v v_, interlobular veins or\r\nthe veins between the lobules. These are branches of the portal vein, which\r\ncarries blood from the stomach and intestines to the liver; _c c_,\r\ncapillaries, or very fine blood vessels, extending as a very fine network\r\nbetween the groups of liver cells from the interlobular vein to the center\r\nof the lobule and emptying there into the intralobular vein to the center\r\nof the lobule; _v c_, intralobular vein, or the vein within the lobule.\r\nThis vessel passes out of the lobule and there becomes the sublobular vein;\r\n_v s_, sublobular vein. This joins other similar veins and helps to form\r\nthe hepatic vein, through which the blood leaves the liver; _d d_, the\r\nposition of the liver cells between the meshes of the capillaries; _A A_,\r\nbranches of the hepatic artery to the interlobular connective tissue and\r\nthe walls of the large veins and large bile ducts. These branches are seen\r\nat _r r_ and form the vena vascularis; _v v_, vena vascularis; _i i_,\r\nbranches of the hepatic artery entering the substance of the lobule and\r\nconnecting with capillaries from the interlobular vein. The use of the\r\nhepatic artery is to nourish the liver, while the other vessels carry blood\r\nto be modified by the liver cells in certain important directions; _g_,\r\nbranches of the bile ducts, carrying bile from the various lobules into the\r\ngall bladder and into the intestines; _x x_, intralobular bile capillaries\r\nbetween the liver cells. These form a network of very minute tubes\r\nsurrounding each ultimate cell, which receives the bile as it is formed by\r\nthe liver cells and carried outward as described.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Isolated liver cells: _c_, blood capillary; _a_, fine bile\r\ncapillary channel.\r\n\r\nPLATE V. Ergot in hay: 1, bluegrass; 2, timothy; 3, wild rye; 4, redtop.\r\nErgot is a fungus which may affect any member of the grass family.

T. ATKINSON, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by C. DWIGHT MARSH, Ph. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITION OF A POISON.\r\n\r\nTo define clearly the meaning of the word \"poison\" is somewhat difficult.\r\nEven in law the word has never been defined, and when a definition is\r\nattempted we are apt to include either too much or too little. The\r\nfollowing definition given by Husemann is perhaps the best: \"Poisons are\r\nthose substances, inorganic or organic, existing in the organism or\r\nintroduced from the outside, produced artificially or formed as natural\r\nproducts, which, through their chemical nature, under definite conditions,\r\nso affect some organ of a living organism that the health or well-being of\r\nthe organism is temporarily or chronically injured.\" The common conception\r\nof a poison is any substance which, in small quantity, will destroy life,\r\nexcept such as act by purely mechanical means, as, for example, powdered\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nSome substances that are not usually looked upon as poisons may destroy\r\nlife if given in large doses, such as common salt. Other substances which\r\nare perfectly harmless when taken into the body in the usual way are\r\npoisons if injected into the circulation, such as distilled water, milk, or\r\nglycerin. Living organisms are not \"chemical substances,\" and are not\r\nconsidered in this connection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF POISONING.\r\n\r\nPoisoning may come from many causes, among the chief of which are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(1) _Errors in medication._--By using the wrong substance or too large dose\r\nan animal may be poisoned.\r\n\r\n(2) _The exposure of poisons used for horticultural, technical, or other\r\nlegitimate purposes._--Poisons used for spraying plants, disinfecting,\r\npoisoning vermin, dipping cattle or sheep, painting, smelting, dyeing, or\r\nother purposes may be so handled as to come within the reach of animals.\r\n\r\n(3) _Damaged food._--Food that has undergone putrefaction or certain kinds\r\nof fermentation or heating, may have become poisonous, producing forage\r\npoisoning, meat poisoning, cheese poisoning, etc.\r\n\r\n(4) _Poisonous plants in the pasture or forage._\r\n\r\n(5) _The bite or sting of a poisonous insect or the bite of an animal._\r\n\r\n(6) _Malicious poisoning._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACTION OF POISONS.\r\n\r\nThe action of poisons may be either local, and exerted directly on the\r\ntissues with which they come in contact, or remote, acting through the\r\ncirculation or the nervous system; or both local and remote action may be\r\nexerted by the same drug. Poisons which act locally generally either\r\ndestroy by corrosion the tissues with which they come in contact or by\r\ninhalation set up acute inflammation. When any corrosive agent is taken\r\ninto the stomach in poisonous quantities, a group of symptoms is developed\r\nwhich is common to all. The tissues with which the agent comes in contact\r\nare destroyed, sloughing and acute inflammation of the surrounding\r\nstructures take place; intense pain in the abdomen and death ensue. In a\r\nlike manner, but with less rapidity, the same result is reached if the\r\nagent used be not of a sufficiently corrosive nature to destroy the\r\ntissues, but sufficiently irritating to set up acute inflammation of the\r\nmucous membrane of the digestive tract. If the poison exerts a remote\r\ninfluence alone, the action is quite different, little or no local effect\r\nbeing produced upon the digestive organs.\r\n\r\nTo produce an effect on some part of the body distant from the channel of\r\nentrance, a poison must have been absorbed and carried in the blood to the\r\ncentral nervous system or other region involved. The poisonous effect of\r\nany substance is modified by the quantity used; by its chemical\r\ncombinations; by the part of the animal structure with which it comes in\r\ncontact; by the physical condition of the subject; and also by the rapidity\r\nwith which the poison is excreted. As an illustration, opium may be given\r\nwith safety in much larger doses to an animal suffering from acute pain\r\nthan to one free from pain, and to an adult animal with greater safety than\r\nto a young one. The rapidity with which the poison is absorbed, owing to\r\nthe part of the body with which it is brought in contact, is also an\r\nimportant factor. So marked is this quality that some agents which have the\r\npower of destroying life with almost absolute certainty when introduced\r\nbeneath the skin, may be taken into the stomach without causing\r\ninconvenience, as curara, the arrow poisons, or the venomous secretion of\r\nsnakes. Other agents in chemical combination may tend to intensify, lessen,\r\nor wholly neutralize the poisonous effect. For example, arsenic in itself\r\nhas well-marked poisonous properties, but when brought in contact with\r\ndialyzed iron it forms an insoluble compound and becomes innocuous.\r\nIdiosyncrasies are not so noticeable in cattle practice as in practice\r\namong human beings, but the uncertainty with which some drugs exert their\r\ninfluence would lead us to believe that well-marked differences in\r\nsusceptibility exist. Even in some cases a tolerance for poison is\r\nengendered, so that in a herd of animals equally exposed injurious or fatal\r\neffects do not appear with uniformity. For example, among cattle that are\r\ncompelled to drink water holding in solution a salt of lead the effects of\r\nthe poisoning will be found varying all the way from fatality to\r\nimperceptibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF POISONING.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to differentiate between poisoning and some disease.\r\nIndeed, examination during the life of the animal is sometimes wholly\r\ninadequate to the formation of an opinion as to whether the case is one of\r\npoisoning or, if it is, as to what the poison may be. A chemical and\r\nphysical examination after the death of the animal may be necessary to\r\nclear up the doubt. On the other hand, the symptoms may be of such a nature\r\nas to point unmistakably to poisoning with a certain agent. In general, the\r\nfollowing classes of symptoms may be regarded as indicative of poisoning:\r\nSudden onset of the disease without visible cause, a number of animals\r\nbeing similarly affected at once, with severe gastrointestinal disorder or\r\nderangement of the nervous system, or both; sudden alteration of heart\r\naction in relation to frequency, force, or rhythm; local irritation,\r\ndyspnea, or change in the urine or urination.\r\n\r\nAfter death, lesions of the greatest variety may be found, and it is\r\nnecessary for one to be skilled in anatomy and pathology in order to\r\ndetermine their significance. Oftentimes the stomach and intestines are\r\nred, have thick walls, and contain blood. This signifies a severe irritant,\r\nsuch as arsenic or corrosive sublimate. Other alterations sometimes found\r\nare inflammation of the kidneys or bladder, points of hemorrhage in various\r\norgans, changes in the blood, congestion of the lungs, and certain\r\nmicroscopic changes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of animals suffering from poison must vary according to the\r\nnature of the toxic agent. There are a few general plans of action,\r\nhowever, which should be followed so far as possible. In man and in some of\r\nthe smaller animals it is possible to eliminate unabsorbed poison by the\r\nuse of the stomach pump or by causing vomiting. These proceedings are\r\nimpracticable in cattle. It is well, therefore, in many cases to endeavor\r\nto expel the unabsorbed poison by emptying the digestive tract, so far as\r\nmay be, with a nonirritating purge. Castor oil in doses of 1 pint to 2\r\nquarts is adapted to this purpose. If the poison is known to be\r\nnonirritant--as a narcotic plant--from 10 to 20 drops of croton oil may be\r\ngiven with a quart of castor oil. When poisons are somewhat prolonged in\r\ntheir effect, Epsom salt in doses of 1 pound can be given advantageously.\r\nTo protect the mucous membrane from the action of strong irritants, one may\r\ngive flaxseed tea, barley water, the whites of eggs, milk, butter, olive\r\noil, or fresh lard. Chemical antidotes may sometimes be used for special\r\npoisons, as advised below. In general, if an acid has been taken it may be\r\nneutralized with an alkali, such as chalk, magnesia, bicarbonate of soda\r\n(baking soda), ammonia (diluted), or soap. If the poison is an alkali, such\r\nas caustic soda or potash (lye), or ammonia, an acid, such as diluted (1\r\nper cent) sulphuric acid or vinegar, may be administered. Special\r\ntreatments and antidotes are considered below.\r\n\r\nA poisonous agent may be so gradually introduced into the system as to\r\nslowly develop the power of resistance against its own action. In other\r\ncases where the poison is introduced slowly the poisonous action becomes\r\naccumulative, and, although there is no increase in the quantity taken,\r\nviolent symptoms are suddenly developed, as if the whole amount, the\r\nconsumption of which may have extended over a considerable period, had been\r\ngiven in one dose. Other agents, poisonous in their nature, tend to\r\ndeteriorate some of the important organs, and, interfering with their\r\nnatural functions, are productive of conditions of ill health which,\r\nalthough not necessarily fatal, are important. Such might properly be\r\ncalled chronic poisons. Poisons of themselves dangerous when administered\r\nin large doses are used medicinally for curative purposes, and a very large\r\npercentage of the pharmaceutical preparations used in the practice of\r\nmedicine if given in excessive quantities may produce serious results. In\r\nthe administration of medicines, therefore, care should be exercised not\r\nonly that the animal is not poisoned by the administration of an excessive\r\ndose but that injury is not done by continued treatment with medicines the\r\nadministration of which is not called for.\r\n\r\n\r\nMINERAL POISONS.\r\n\r\nARSENIC POISONING.\r\n\r\nOf the common irritant and corrosive poisons, arsenic, especially one of\r\nits compounds (Paris green), is likely to be the most dangerous to our\r\nclass of patients. The common practice of using Paris green and other\r\ncompounds of arsenic as insecticides for the destruction of potato beetle\r\nand other insect enemies of the farmer and fruit grower has had the effect\r\nof introducing it into almost all farming establishments. White arsenic is\r\nalso a principal ingredient in some popular dipping preparations, and\r\npoisoning from this source occasionally takes place when, after dipping,\r\nanimals are allowed to run in a yard in which there is loose fodder. The\r\ndrippings from the animals falling on the fodder render it poisonous and\r\ndangerous to animal life if eaten. Familiarity with its use has in many\r\ninstances tended to breed contempt for its potency as a poison. Rat poisons\r\noften contain arsenic. The excessive use of arsenic as a tonic, or of\r\n\"condition powders\" containing arsenic, has been the means of poisoning\r\nmany animals. This is the common poison used by malicious persons with\r\ncriminal intent. The poison may also be absorbed through wounds or through\r\nthe skin if used as a dip or bath.\r\n\r\nIf a large dose is given, at once acute poisoning is produced; if repeated\r\nsmall doses are given, chronic poisoning may result. The poisonous dose for\r\nan ox is from 3 drams to 1 ounce.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of acute poisoning first appear as those of\r\ncolic; the animal is restless, stamping with the feet, lying down and\r\ngetting up. There is tenderness on pressure over the abdomen. The acute\r\nsymptoms increase; in a few hours violent diarrhea is developed; in many\r\ncases blood and shreds of detached mucous membrane are mixed with the\r\nevacuations. There is irregular and feeble pulse and respiration, and death\r\nis likely to supervene between the eighteenth hour and the third day. If\r\nthe latter period is passed, there is a reasonable hope of recovery.\r\n\r\nIn chronic poisoning the symptoms are similar to those of chronic\r\ngastrointestinal catarrh, with indigestion, diarrhea, and general weakness\r\nand loss of condition.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The antidote for arsenic is a solution of hydrated oxid of\r\niron in water. It should be prepared fresh by mixing a solution of sulphate\r\nof iron, made by dissolving 4 ounces of sulphate of iron in one-half pint\r\nwater, with a suspension of 1 ounce of magnesia in one-half pint water.\r\nThis quantity is sufficient for one dose for a cow and may be repeated in\r\nan hour, if much arsenic was taken. A solution of calcined magnesia or\r\npowdered iron or iron filings or iron scale from a blacksmith's forge may\r\nbe given in the absence of other remedies. Powdered sulphur is of some\r\nvalue as an antidote. One must also administer protectives, such as linseed\r\ntea, barley water, whites of eggs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEAD POISONING.\r\n\r\nLead poisoning of cattle sometimes comes from their having licked freshly\r\npainted surfaces and thus swallowed compounds containing white lead. In\r\nseveral instances cattle have been poisoned by silage from a silo painted\r\ninside with lead paint shortly before filling. Sometimes cattle eat dried\r\npaint scrapings with apparent relish and are poisoned. Cattle grazing on\r\nrifle ranges have been poisoned by lead from the bullets. Sugar of lead has\r\nbeen administered by mistake for Glauber's salt. Lead poisoning may be\r\nacute or chronic. The fatal dose of sugar of lead is from 1 to 4 ounces.\r\nWater drawn from lead pipes or held in a lead-lined tank may cause\r\npoisoning.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are generally dullness, lying down with the head\r\nturned toward the flank, colic, rumbling in the abdomen, loss of control of\r\nthe limbs when walking, twitching, champing of the jaws, moving in a\r\ncircle, convulsions, delirium, violent bellowing, followed by stupor and\r\ndeath. The symptoms generally extend over considerable time but may end in\r\ndeath after 24 hours.\r\n\r\n_Chronic lead poisoning_ occasionally occurs in districts where lead mining\r\nis the principal industry. The waste products of the mine thrown into\r\nstreams contaminate the water supply, so that the mineral is taken into the\r\nsystem gradually, and a very small per cent of any of the salts taken into\r\nthe system in this way is pernicious. Water which contains any salt of lead\r\nto the extent of more than one-tenth of a grain to the gallon is unfit to\r\ndrink. Such water when used continually is likely to produce colic from the\r\nresulting intestinal irritation, and in aggravated cases paralysis more or\r\nless severe is likely to be developed. A blue line on the margin of the\r\ngums, the last symptom, is regarded as diagnostic and its presence as\r\nconclusive evidence of the nature of the disorder.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment should first be directed toward removing the\r\ncause. A large dose of purgative medicine should be given, and the brain\r\nsymptoms be relieved by giving bromid of potassium in half-ounce doses\r\nevery 4 or 5 hours and by the application of cold water to the head. Dilute\r\nsulphuric acid in half-ounce doses should be given with the purgative\r\nmedicine. In this case sulphate of magnesia (Epsom salt) is the best\r\npurgative, and it may be given in doses of from 1 to 2 pounds dissolved in\r\nwarm water. After the acute symptoms have abated, iodid of potassium may be\r\ngiven, in doses of 2 drams each, three times a day for a week.\r\n\r\nNo treatment is likely to be of avail until the cause is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER POISONING.\r\n\r\nThe soluble salts of copper, though used as a tonic in the medicinal\r\ntreatment of cattle, are poisonous when taken in large quantities. Like\r\nlead and arsenic, they have an irritant effect upon the mucous membrane\r\nwith which they come in contact in a concentrated form. Cattle are not very\r\nlikely to be poisoned from this cause unless through carelessness. Sulphate\r\nof copper, commonly called blue vitriol, is occasionally used for\r\ndisinfecting and cleansing stables, where it might inadvertently be mixed\r\nwith the feed. It is also used largely for making the Bordeaux mixture used\r\nin spraying fruit trees. The general symptoms produced are those of\r\nintestinal irritation, short breathing, stamping, and tender abdomen.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give powdered iron, or iron reduced by hydrogen, or calcined\r\nmagnesia. Sulphur may be used. This should be followed by a liberal supply\r\nof demulcents, linseed infusion, boiled starch, whites of eggs, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC POISONING.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the soluble salts of zinc are irritant poisons. The chlorid and\r\nsulphate are those in most common use. In animals which have power to vomit\r\nthey are emetic in their action. In others, when retained in the stomach,\r\nthey set up more or less irritation of the mucous membrane and abdominal\r\npain, producing symptoms already described in the action of other poisons\r\nwhich produce the same result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment should be the same as for copper poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORUS POISONING.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the forms of phosphorus in common use--the ordinary yellow--is\r\npoisonous. Phosphorus in this form is used for the destruction of rats and\r\nmice and other vermin, and has been largely used in the manufacture of\r\nmatches.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are loss of appetite, colic, diarrhea, irritation\r\nof the mouth and throat, and paralysis of the throat. There is also\r\nweakness, difficult breathing, and rapid pulse. The course of the poisoning\r\nis usually rapid, terminating in either recovery or death within three\r\ndays. The toxic dose for cattle is from 5 to 30 grains. If taken in large\r\nquantities the excreta are occasionally noticed to be luminous when\r\nexamined in the dark.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Turpentine is given in an emulsion with flaxseed tea in a\r\nsingle dose of from 2 to 8 ounces. Permanganate of potassium may be given\r\nin a one-fourth of 1 per cent solution. Stimulants, such as alcohol and\r\nether, should be administered. Oils and milk must not be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCURY POISONING.\r\n\r\nMercury poisoning is not rare in cattle from the fact that these animals\r\nhave a special susceptibility to the action of this substance. Antiseptic\r\nwashes or injections containing the bichlorid of mercury (corrosive\r\nsublimate) must be used on cattle with great care. Mercurial disinfecting\r\nsolutions or salves must be used cautiously. Calomel can not be given\r\nfreely to cattle.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are salivation, sore mouth, indigestion,\r\ndiarrhea, skin eruption, paralysis of local groups of muscles, and\r\nnephritis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment consists in administering sulphur in large\r\ndoses (2 to 4 ounces) or iron powder. Both make insoluble compounds with\r\nmercury. Follow with the whites of eggs mixed with water and with linseed\r\ntea. If the case does not terminate promptly, give iodid of potash in\r\n1-dram doses twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY ACIDS.\r\n\r\nMINERAL ACIDS.--The mineral acids--nitric, sulphuric, hydrochloric, etc.--\r\nwhen used in a concentrated form destroy the animal tissues with which they\r\ncome in contact, and in this respect differ from most of the poisons\r\npreviously described. When taken into the stomach the mucous membrane of\r\nthe mouth, pharynx, esophagus, and stomach is apt to be more or less\r\ncompletely destroyed. If taken in large quantities death is likely to\r\nresult so speedily that nothing can be done to relieve the patient, and\r\neven if time is allowed and the action of the acid can be arrested it can\r\nnot be done until considerable and, perhaps, irreparable damage has been\r\ndone. The mucous membrane with which the acid has come in contact in the\r\nesophagus may be destroyed by its corrosive action and carried away,\r\nleaving the muscular tissues exposed. The raw surface heals irregularly,\r\nthe cicatrice contracting causes stricture, and an animal so injured is\r\nlikely to die of starvation. In the stomach even greater damage is likely\r\nto be done. The peristaltic action of the esophagus carries the irritant\r\nalong quickly, but here it remains quiet in contact with one surface,\r\ndestroying it. It is likely to perforate the organ and, coming in contact\r\nwith the abdominal lining or other organs of digestion, soon sets up a\r\ncondition that is beyond repair. In a less concentrated form, when this is\r\nnot sufficiently strong to be corrosive, it exerts an irritant effect. In\r\nthis form it may not do much harm unless taken in considerable quantity.\r\nWhen thus the mucous membrane of the stomach and intestines becomes\r\ninflamed pain and diarrhea are likely to result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Any of the alkalies may be used as an antidote. Most\r\nconvenient of these are chalk, baking soda, marble dust, magnesia, lime,\r\nsoap, or plaster from a wall. Mucilaginous drinks should be given in large\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE ACIDS.--Oxalic acid in particular is corrosive in its action when\r\ntaken in concentrated solution, losing its corrosive effect and becoming\r\nirritant when more dilute. It also exerts a specific effect on the heart,\r\nfrequently causing death from syncope. Taken in the form either of the\r\ncrystals or solution it is likely to cause death in a very short time.\r\nFailure of heart action and the attendant small pulse, weakness,\r\nstaggering, and convulsions are the more noticeable symptoms. Acetic acid\r\nis irritant to the gastrointestinal tract, and may cause sudden paralysis\r\nof the heart.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The action of the acid should be counteracted by the use of\r\nalkalies, as advised above, by limewater or lime or plaster given promptly,\r\nby protectives to the digestive tract, and by stimulants.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY ALKALIES.\r\n\r\nThe carbonates of potash and soda and the alkalies themselves in\r\nconcentrated form cause symptoms of intestinal irritation similar to those\r\nproduced by mineral acids. Ammonia, caustic soda, and caustic potash (lye)\r\nare those to which animals are most exposed. The degree of their caustic\r\nirritant effects depends on their degree of concentration. When they reach\r\nthe stomach the symptoms are nearly as well marked as in the case of the\r\nacids. The irritation is even more noticeable, and purgation is likely to\r\nbe a more prominent symptom. If death is not caused soon, the irritation of\r\nthe gastrointestinal tract and malnutrition will last for a long time.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in neutralizing the alkali by an acid,\r\nsuch as dilute sulphuric acid (1 per cent) or strong vinegar. The\r\nadministration of such an antidote and its action must be carefully watched\r\nduring administration. In the chemical change which takes place when the\r\nacid and alkali are combined, carbonic-acid gas is liberated, which may be\r\nto an extent sufficient to cause considerable distention of the abdomen,\r\nand even to produce asphyxia from pressure forward on the diaphragm. Should\r\nthis danger present itself, it may be averted by opening the flank,\r\npermitting the gas to escape. (See \"Acute tympanites, or Bloating,\" p. 22.)\r\nFlaxseed or slippery-elm decoction must be given to sooth the inflamed\r\nmucous surface. Opium may be used to allay pain.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAL-OIL POISONING.\r\n\r\nCoal oil is sometimes administered empirically as a treatment for\r\nintestinal parasites. If given in large doses it produces poisonous\r\neffects, which are likely to be manifested some time after the\r\nadministration. It acts as an irritant to the digestive tract, causing\r\ndribbling of ropy saliva from the mouth, diarrhea, tenesmus, and loss of\r\nappetite, with increased temperature and cold extremities. Visible mucous\r\nmembranes are injected, pupils of the eyes are contracted, and there is a\r\nwatery discharge from the eyes and nostrils. Remotely it exerts a\r\ndepressing influence on the functions of the brain and slight coma, and\r\noccasionally convulsions, from which the animal is easily aroused. The\r\nkidneys also suffer. The urine is dark colored and has the characteristic\r\nodor of coal oil. Death may result from gastroenteritis or convulsions.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The patient's strength should be fostered by the frequent\r\nadministration of mild stimulants, of which aromatic spirits of ammonia is\r\nperhaps the best. The animal should be encouraged to eat soft feed and\r\ngiven mucilaginous drinks.\r\n\r\nCrude coal oil is sometimes applied to the skin to kill parasites. If too\r\nmuch is used, especially in hot weather, great weakness and depression may\r\nbe caused and in some cases death may result.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARBOLIC-ACID POISONING.\r\n\r\nAlthough one of the most valuable antiseptic remedies, carbolic acid in a\r\nconcentrated form, when taken internally or used over a large surface\r\nexternally, is likely to produce poisonous effects. It causes whitening,\r\nshrinking, and numbness of the structures with which it comes in contact,\r\nand, besides its irritant effect, exerts a powerful influence on the\r\nnervous system. Being readily absorbed, it produces its effect whether\r\nswallowed, injected into the rectum, inhaled, or applied to wounds, or even\r\nto a large tract of unbroken skin. Used extensively as a dressing, it may\r\nproduce nausea, dizziness, and smoky or blackish colored urine. The last\r\nsymptom is nearly always noticeable where the poisonous effect is produced.\r\nIn more concentrated form, or used in larger quantities, convulsions,\r\nfollowed by fatal coma, are likely to take place. Even in smaller\r\nquantities, dullness, trembling, and disinclination for food often continue\r\nfor several days. In a tolerably concentrated solution it coagulates\r\nalbumen and acts as an astringent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As an antidote internally, a solution of sulphate of soda or\r\nsulphate of magnesia (Glauber's or Epsom salt) may be given. The white of\r\negg is also useful. Stimulants may be given if needed. When the poisoning\r\noccurs through too extensive applications to wounds or the skin, as in\r\ntreatment of mange, cold water should be freely applied so as to wash off\r\nany of the acid that may still remain unabsorbed. As a surgical dressing a\r\n3 per cent solution is strong enough for ordinary purposes. Water will not\r\nhold more than 5 per cent in permanent solution. No preparation stronger\r\nthan the saturated solution should be used medicinally under any\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALTPETER POISONING.\r\n\r\nBoth nitrate of soda and nitrate of potassium are poisonous to cattle.\r\nThese substances are used for manure and for preserving meats. They may be\r\nadministered in a drench by error in place of Glauber's salt, or they may\r\nbe exposed within reach of cattle and thus be eaten. The toxic dose depends\r\nupon the condition of fullness of the stomach. If in solution and given on\r\nan empty stomach, as little as 3 ounces of saltpeter (nitrate of potassium)\r\nmay be fatal to a cow. More of the Chile saltpeter (nitrate of soda) is\r\nrequired to cause serious trouble.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Severe gastroenteritis, colic, tympanites, diarrhea, excessive\r\nurination, weakness, trembling, convulsions, collapse.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Same as for poisoning by common salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY COMMON SALT.\r\n\r\nA few pounds (3 to 5) of common salt will produce well-marked signs of\r\npoisoning in cattle. So much salt as this will not be taken by cattle\r\nexcept under unusual conditions. If the feed is poor in salt, and if no\r\nsalt has been given for a long time, an intense \"salt hunger\" may occur\r\nthat may lead an animal to eat a poisonous quantity, or an overdose of salt\r\nmay be given by error as a drench. In order to prevent overeating of salt,\r\nit is doubtless better in salting cattle to use rock salt rather than that\r\nin more or less finely divided form.\r\n\r\nHerring and mackerel brine and pork pickle are also poisonous, and are\r\nespecially dangerous for hogs. In these substances there are, in addition\r\nto salt, certain products extracted from the fish or meat which undergo\r\nchange and add to the toxicity of the solution. Sometimes saltpeter is\r\npresent in such brines.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are great thirst, abdominal pain, diarrhea, poor\r\nappetite, redness and dryness of the mouth, increased urination, paralysis\r\nof the hind legs, weak pulse, general paralysis, coma, and death in from\r\nsix to eight hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Allow as much warm water as the animal will drink; give\r\nprotectives, such as linseed tea, etc. Linseed or olive oil may be given.\r\nTo keep up the heart action give ether, alcohol, camphor, digitalis, or\r\ncoffee. To allay pain, give opium.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE POISONS.\r\n\r\nVegetable poisons may be divided into two classes--those that are likely to\r\nbe administered to the animal as medicine, and such as may be taken in the\r\nfeed, either in the shape of poisonous plants or as plants or feeds of\r\nvegetable origin that have been damaged by fungi or by bacteria which have\r\nproduced fermentation or putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE POISONS USED AS MEDICINE.\r\n\r\nOPIUM (MORPHIN, LAUDANUM) POISONING.\r\n\r\nOpium and its alkaloid, morphia, are so commonly used in the practice of\r\nmedicine that the poisonous result of an overdose is not uncommon. The\r\ncommon preparations are gum opium, the inspissated juice of the poppy;\r\npowdered opium, made from the gum; tincture of opium, commonly called\r\nlaudanum; and the alkaloid or active principle, morphia. Laudanum has about\r\none-eighth the strength of the gum or powder. Morphia is present in good\r\nopium to the extent of about 10 per cent. In medicine it is a most useful\r\nagent in allaying pain. It first produces a stimulating action, which is\r\nfollowed by drowsiness, a disposition to sleep or complete anesthesia,\r\ndepending on the quantity of the drug used. In poisonous doses a state of\r\nexhilaration is well marked at first. This is particularly noticeable in\r\ncattle and in horses. The animal becomes much excited, and this stage does\r\nnot pass into insensibility unless an enormous dose has been given. If the\r\ndose is large enough, a second stage sometimes supervenes, in which the\r\nsymptoms are those of congestion of the brain. The visible membranes have a\r\nbluish tint (cyanotic) from interference with the air supply. The breathing\r\nis slow, labored, and later stertorous; the pupils of the eyes are very\r\nmuch contracted; the skin dry and warm. Gas accumulates in the stomach, so\r\nthat tympanites is a prominent symptom. The patient may be aroused by great\r\nnoise or the infliction of sharp pain, when the breathing becomes more\r\nnatural. A lapse into the comatose condition takes place when the\r\nexcitement ceases. Later, there is perfect coma and the patient can no\r\nlonger be aroused from the insensible condition. The contraction of the\r\npupil becomes more marked, the breathing intermittent and slower, there is\r\nperspiration, the pulse more feeble and rapid, till death takes place.\r\nPoisoning of cattle with opium or its products rarely goes beyond the stage\r\nof excitement, because the quantity of the drug required for the later\r\neffects is so great. Seventy-five grains of morphia administered\r\nsubcutaneously has sufficed merely to excite for 12 hours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give strong coffee, 1 to 4 quarts, aromatic spirits of\r\nammonia or carbonate of ammonia. Atropia is the physiological antidote.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRYCHNIN POISONING.\r\n\r\nStrychnin is a very concentrated poison and produces its effect very\r\nquickly, usually only a few minutes being necessary if given in sufficient\r\ndose and in such a way that it will be at once absorbed. When employed as a\r\nmedicine, as a rule, minimum doses should be used, as cattle are quite\r\nsusceptible to its effects and may be killed by the maximum doses given in\r\nthe common manuals of veterinary medicine. The first noticeable symptom is\r\nevidence of unrest or mental excitement; at the same time the muscles over\r\nthe shoulder and croup may be seen to quiver or twitch, and later there\r\noccurs a more or less well-marked convulsion; the head is jerked back, the\r\nback arched and leg extended, the eyes drawn. The spasm continues for only\r\na few minutes, when it relaxes and another occurs in a short time. The\r\nreturn is hastened by excitement and in a short time again disappears,\r\ncontinuing to disappear and reappear until death results. As the poisonous\r\neffect advances the intervals between the spasms become shorter and less\r\nmarked and the spasms more severe until the animal dies in violent\r\nstruggles.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The best method is to put the patient under the influence of\r\nchloral, chloroform, or ether, and keep it there continuously until the\r\neffect of the poison has passed off. Alcohol may be given in large doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nACONITE POISONING.\r\n\r\nIn recent years tincture of aconite has become a popular stable remedy. If\r\nan animal is ailing, aconite is given whether indicated or not. Fortunately\r\nthe dose used is generally small, and for this reason the damage done is\r\nmuch less than it would otherwise be. Aconite is one of the most deadly\r\npoisons known. It produces paralysis of motion and sensation, depresses the\r\nheart's action, and causes death by paralysis of respiration. In large\r\ndoses it causes profuse salivation, champing of the jaws, and attempts at\r\nswallowing. If not sufficient to cause death, there is impaired appetite\r\nwith more or less nausea for some time after. In poisonous doses it causes\r\nthe animal to tremble violently, to lose power to support itself, and\r\nbrings on slight convulsions, with perspiration. The pulse is depressed,\r\nirregular, and afterwards intermittent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The chemical antidote is tannic acid, which forms an\r\ninsoluble compound with the aconitin. The depressing effect on the heart\r\nshould be counteracted by the use of ammonia, digitalis, alcohol, camphor,\r\nor other diffusible stimulants, which have a physiological effect opposite\r\nto aconite.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS PLANTS.\r\n\r\nAn important group of poisons may be classed under this head. In most cases\r\nit is poison naturally belonging in the plant; in other cases the poisonous\r\nprinciple is developed in what would otherwise be harmless plants as a\r\nplant disease, or as a fermentation or putrefaction due to bacterial growth\r\nand observed in forage, grain, or meal that has become heated, damaged, or\r\n\"spoilt.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of poisonous plants is an important one and is of especial\r\ninterest to those using the western stock ranges, for it is probable that\r\nthere is no other single cause producing so many fatalities. In this\r\narticle only a few of the more important plants are treated in a brief way,\r\nfor an extended treatise would be necessary if the subject were to be\r\nhandled adequately. Further information should be sought in the more\r\nelaborate publications. Many of the American poisonous plants have been\r\ntreated in bulletins issued by the United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for plant poisoning._--Remedies given by the mouth in most cases\r\nfail to give relief to cattle affected by poisonous plants. The material of\r\nthe poisonous plants in the first stomach is not very largely affected by a\r\nremedy given as a drench. If any beneficial result is effected, it must be\r\non the material which has already passed into the fourth stomach, so that\r\nto get any real antidotal result the remedy must be given repeatedly in\r\norder to meet the alkaloid poisons as they are passing through the fourth\r\nstomach. While certain substances like tannic acid and potassium\r\npermanganate are the logical antidotes for plant poisons, in practical\r\napplication they are very disappointing in the treatment of ruminant\r\nanimals. Reliance must be mainly on prevention and upon such remedies as\r\nwill increase elimination. A laxative or purgative is always helpful, and\r\nfor this purpose Epsom salt may be given in pound doses, or linseed oil in\r\ndoses of 1 or 2 pints. In some few cases special remedies can be given as\r\nis indicated below.\r\n\r\nIt is well to bear in mind that cattle while grazing freely in good pasture\r\nare not likely to eat poisonous plants to any extent. If these same plants\r\nare gathered and thrown in a pile, the animals, through a kind of\r\npernicious curiosity, may eat them with disastrous results. This has\r\nfrequently happened when freshly cut branches of cherry, yew, oleander, and\r\nother plants have been thrown where dairy cattle could get at them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOAKS.\r\n\r\nThe foliage of oaks is a valuable constituent of the forage on many ranges\r\nand pastures. It has been shown, however, that when this is eaten without\r\nsome admixture of other food, cattle frequently sicken and die. Many cases\r\nof the poisoning of cattle by acorns have been reported in England and\r\nGermany, and there have been some complaints in the United States. Harmful\r\nresults from eating acorns do not seem likely to occur except as they are\r\neaten in considerable quantities.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of oak poisoning are constipation, mucus and\r\nblood in the feces, emaciation, and edema. The symptoms of acorn poisoning\r\nare much the same.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Change of pasture or an addition of other food material.\r\n\r\n\r\nHORSE CHESTNUT--BUCKEYE.\r\n\r\nAll the species of _∆sculus,_ popularly known as horse chestnut or buckeye,\r\nare considered poisonous. The bark, leaves, and fruit are injurious. It is\r\nsaid that if the fruit is boiled or roasted and washed out it becomes\r\nharmless and even is a desirable addition to the feed of cattle. The\r\nIndians in time of scarcity of food have used the fruit after preparing it\r\nin this way. The buckeyes are said to have a specific effect in producing\r\nabortion in cattle and goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH CAMAS (SPECIES OF ZYGADENUS).\r\n\r\nThe death-camas plants, which are commonly known in the Pacific States as\r\n\"lobelia,\" are especially destructive of sheep, but cattle sometimes eat\r\nthem and are poisoned. Cases of cattle poisoning are not likely to result\r\nfatally.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are salivation, nausea accompanied by vomiting,\r\ngreat weakness, and lowered temperature.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--There is no effective treatment for death-camas poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLY POISON (CHROSPERMA MUSC∆TORIUM).\r\n\r\nThis plant, which is closely related to the death-camas plants, is\r\nsometimes known as \"stagger grass\" and causes a considerable loss in the\r\nSouthern States. It grows earlier than the grasses, and on this account is\r\nmore likely to be eaten. Like death camas, it produces pronounced nausea,\r\nresulting in vomiting and weakness, and in cases which recover the effects\r\nmay continue for several days. Apparently the injurious effects are more\r\ncommon in the case of cattle than in other domestic animals. There is no\r\nknown way of treating these animals, though doubtless purgatives would be\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nYEW (TAXUS BACCATA).\r\n\r\nThe European yew has long been known as a very poisonous plant. It is\r\ncultivated in America, and while cases of poisoning have not been common,\r\nit is well to recognize its dangerous character. A comparatively small dose\r\nis poisonous and ordinarily acts with great rapidity. It causes respiratory\r\nparalysis and the animal dies in convulsions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL.\r\n\r\nThe laurels, including the broad-leafed laurel, _Kalmia latifolia_, the\r\nnarrow-leafed laurel, _Kalmia angustifolia_, the rhododendrons, and other\r\nclosely related plants are poisonous and cause considerable losses. It is\r\ndangerous to let cattle graze where these plants are abundant at times when\r\nother forage is scarce. The symptoms are salivation, nausea and vomiting,\r\nspasms, dizziness, stupor, and death.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERN.\r\n\r\nThe common brake or bracken fern, _Pteris aquilina_, has been considered\r\nresponsible for the poisoning of many horses and cattle. Many cases have\r\nbeen reported in England and Germany, and some well-authenticated cases in\r\nthe United States. Very little has been learned experimentally of fern\r\npoisoning, but there seems to be little question that it has been the cause\r\nof many deaths. The symptoms are said to be temperature higher than normal,\r\nloss of appetite, bloody discharges from mouth, nose, and bowels, and great\r\ndepression followed by coma and death. Some authors say that the urine is\r\ncolored by blood. It is thought by some that the disease known as \"red\r\nwater\" in the northwestern United States and Canada is caused by eating\r\nferns.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORGHUM POISONING.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions sorghum contains enough hydrocyanic acid to make\r\nit exceedingly dangerous to cattle. These cases of poisoning most commonly\r\noccur when cattle are pastured upon the young plant or upon a field where\r\nthe crop has been cut and is making a second growth. Conditions of drought\r\nmake the sorghum especially dangerous. There is some reason to think that\r\nthe frosted second growth is particularly rich in hydrocyanic acid. The\r\ncases of poisoning occur when animals are grazed upon the plant, but not\r\nfrom the harvested crop or from silage. If cattle are grazed on sorghum or\r\nsorghum stubble they should at first be under constant observation and\r\nshould be removed as soon as any signs of illness appear. Similar\r\nprecautions should be used in grazing kafir.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNSTALK DISEASE.\r\n\r\nConsiderable losses of cattle have occurred when they were turned upon\r\ncornfields in the fall. Deaths come very suddenly and there is no\r\nopportunity to apply remedies. It has been thought that these fatalities,\r\nlike those from sorghum, were caused by hydrocyanic acid, but there is good\r\nreason to think that this is not true, and at the present time there is no\r\naccepted explanation of this disease, although there seems to be no doubt\r\nthat it is connected in some way with the condition of the corn. Whether a\r\ngiven field is poisonous or not can only be determined by experiment, and\r\nthe wise farmer will keep his cattle under close observation when they are\r\nfirst turned into a cornfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER HEMLOCK (CICUTA).\r\n\r\nThis plant, growing in wet places by ditches and along creeks, is the most\r\npoisonous of North American plants. The root is the poisonous part, and\r\ncattle generally get it when it is plowed up or washed out by high water.\r\nSometimes they pull it up, for the plant occasionally grows out into\r\nditches so that the whole plant will be taken in grazing. The most marked\r\nsymptoms of Cicuta poisoning are the violent convulsions, which remind one\r\nof the effect of strychnin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Little can be done in the way of treatment. The logical thing\r\nis to attempt to control the convulsions by means of morphia, but in view\r\nof the fact that the stomach can not be emptied, the prognosis is not good,\r\nand most cases die.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARKSPURS.\r\n\r\nThe larkspurs are a source of heavy loss to cattle owners in the higher\r\nranges of the West. There are a number of species, growing at altitudes\r\nfrom 4,000 feet to timber line, and all are poisonous. A few cases of\r\npoisoning by larkspurs have been reported in the eastern United States, but\r\nmost of the losses are confined to the West, both because larkspurs grow\r\nthere in greater profusion and because cattle are grazed in that region on\r\nthe open ranges. The losses are confined to cattle, for sheep and horses\r\ncan graze on larkspur with no resulting harm. Most of the larkspur losses\r\noccur in the spring and early summer, as the plants lose their toxicity\r\nafter maturing.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Larkspur poisoning is accompanied by a definite line of\r\nsymptoms. In range animals the first symptom noted is generally the sudden\r\nfalling of the animal and consequent inability to rise. After a while it\r\nmay rise, only to fall again. This may happen repeatedly. In severe cases\r\nthe animal lies prone and exhibits nausea, accompanied by vomiting. It dies\r\nof respiratory paralysis, death many times being hastened by the asphyxia\r\nfollowing the vomiting.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal, if found down, should be turned so that its head\r\nis uphill in order to relieve the lungs. Many cases will recover with no\r\nfurther treatment. Nearly all cases will recover if a hypodermic injection\r\nis given immediately of physostigmin salicylate 1 grain, pilocarpin\r\nhydrochlorid 2 grains, strychnin sulphate 1/2 grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCO.\r\n\r\nThe loco plants have caused especially heavy losses of cattle, horses, and\r\nsheep. They grow in the semiarid regions of the West and sometimes in great\r\nluxuriance. The best known are the \"blue loco,\" the \"woolly loco\" or\r\n\"purple loco,\" and the \"white loco\" or \"rattle-weed.\" The blue loco is\r\ncommon in parts of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah. It affects both horses\r\nand cattle. The purple loco, _Astragalus mollissimus_, is common in Texas\r\nand the adjoining States and extends north as far as Nebraska and Colorado.\r\nIt is especially destructive to horses. The white loco, _Oxytropis\r\nlamberti_, is still more widely distributed, being found in the plains\r\nregion from Alaska to Mexico and west of the Rocky Mountains to central\r\nUtah. The white loco is much more important than the purple loco, for it\r\naffects not only horses but cattle and sheep. These plants belong to the\r\npea family, and there are a number of other species of this family that are\r\nloco plants and produce the same symptoms.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Loco poisoning is a chronic condition and symptoms are shown\r\nonly after somewhat prolonged feeding. The condition is one of cumulative\r\npoisoning, and animals sometimes decline very rapidly after the first\r\nsymptoms appear. In many cases animals acquire a habit of eating loco and\r\nprefer it to any other feed. The poison affects the central nervous system.\r\nThere is a lack of muscular coordination and the animal performs very\r\nerratic movements. In the later stages the animal becomes emaciated and\r\neventually dies of starvation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Locoed animals are badly constipated, and it is important\r\nthat this condition should be remedied at the start. Any purgative can be\r\nused, but Epsom salt has been found especially effective. If locoed animals\r\ncan be turned into a field of alfalfa, a large proportion of them will\r\nrecover with no further treatment. Recovery may be aided by giving cattle,\r\nhypodermically, daily doses of three-twentieths to four-twentieths of a\r\ngrain of strychnin. By this treatment cattle can be cured and put in\r\ncondition for market.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE SNAKEROOT (EUPATORIUM URTIC∆FOLIUM).\r\n\r\nWhite snakeroot, frequently known as \"rich weed,\" is a plant growing in\r\ngreat abundance in some of the eastern and central regions of the United\r\nStates. It is particularly abundant in parts of Ohio, Indiana, and\r\nIllinois, and in western North Carolina. It is responsible for most, if not\r\nall, of the cases of a disease which is commonly known as \"milk sickness.\"\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animals are constipated, sometimes have bloody feces,\r\nbecome weak, and exhibit muscular trembling. This trembling is very\r\ncharacteristic, so that the disease is sometimes known as \"the trembles.\"\r\n\r\n_Remedy._--There are no remedies which will work very efficiently. It is\r\ndesirable to give the animals purgatives like Epsom salt and, of course, to\r\nremove them from fields where this plant is abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAYLESS GOLDENROD (ISOCOMA WRIGHTII).\r\n\r\nThe rayless goldenrod is a plant growing in especial abundance in parts of\r\nthe Pecos Valley in New Mexico and Arizona, and there produces a disease so\r\nmuch like that produced in the East by white snakeroot that it is sometimes\r\ncalled milk sickness. More generally this disease goes under the name of\r\n\"alkali disease.\" The plant has produced heavy losses in the regions where\r\nit grows abundantly.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are much like those produced by the white\r\nsnakeroot. The animals are constipated, sometimes have bloody feces, become\r\nweak, and exhibit muscular trembling. There is good reason to think, too,\r\nthat the milk of cows eating this plant is more or less injurious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A purgative like Epsom salt will aid an animal in recovering,\r\nbut most important is to remove the cattle from pastures where the plant is\r\nabundant and give them an abundance of good forage. Under such conditions\r\nthey are almost certain to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILKWEEDS.\r\n\r\nMany of the milkweeds have long been known to have more or less poisonous\r\nproperties. Within the last few years it has been discovered that certain\r\nof the milkweeds going under the popular name of whorled milkweeds are\r\nespecially toxic. There are at least four species of whorled milkweeds, but\r\ntwo of them are particularly important from the standpoint of people\r\nhandling livestock. One, known scientifically as _Asclepias galioides_, is\r\nharmful in Colorado, Utah, Arizona, and New Mexico, while another, known as\r\n_Asclepias mexicana_, has produced losses, especially in California and\r\nNevada. These whorled milkweeds are distasteful to all animals and are\r\neaten only when the stock is closely confined to pastures where there is\r\nlittle else in the way of forage.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The most prominent symptoms are weakness, producing\r\nstaggering, and this is followed in acute cases by violent spasms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--There is no treatment which will effectively antidote the\r\neffect of the poison. In practically all cases, however, poisoning may be\r\navoided if care is taken to prevent animals from being closely confined\r\nwhere this plant is abundant, as they never eat the plant by choice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHERRY.\r\n\r\nIn the leaves of the cherries more or less hydrocyanic acid is produced,\r\nand when these leaves are eaten in any considerable quantity cases of\r\npoisoning are likely to arise. It is popularly supposed that these cases\r\narise from eating wilted cherry leaves, but there is every reason to think\r\nthat the fresh leaves will produce the same results. These cases are easily\r\nprevented, because no harm results from eating a small quantity of the\r\nleaves, and if the fact is recognized that poisoning may result from eating\r\na large quantity, it is not difficult to care for the animals so as to\r\nprevent poisoning.\r\n\r\n\r\nERGOTISM.\r\n\r\nThe poisonous effects of ergot (Pls. V, VI) appear chiefly in the winter\r\nand spring of the year and among cattle. It is developed among grasses\r\ngrown on rich soil in hot, damp seasons. Rye seems more liable to ergot\r\nthan any of our other crops. Of the grasses which enter into the\r\ncomposition of hay, bluegrass is the most likely to become affected. Ergot\r\nmay also affect redtop, oats, grasses, and grains. On the plant the fungus\r\nmanifests itself on the seeds, where it is easily recognized when the hay\r\nis examined in the mow. The ergotized seeds are several times larger than\r\nthe natural seeds--hard, black, and generally curved in shape.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the protracted use of ergot in the feed is pretty well\r\nunderstood to be that of producing a degeneration and obstruction of the\r\nsmaller arterial branches. The result is to shut off the blood supply to\r\nthe distal parts of the body, where the circulation is weakest, and thus to\r\nproduce a mummification or dry gangrene of the extremities, as the ears,\r\ntail, feet, etc. Cattle seem to be more susceptible than other animals to\r\nthe influence of ergot, possibly on account of the slowness of the heart's\r\naction. When the effect of the poison has become sufficient to entirely\r\narrest the circulation in any part, the structures soon die. The disorder\r\nmanifests itself as lameness in one or more limbs; swelling about the ankle\r\nwhich may result in only a small slough or the loss of a toe, but it may\r\ncircumscribe the limb at any point below the knee or hock by an indented\r\nring below which the tissues become dead. The indentation soon changes to a\r\ncrack, which extends completely around the limb, forming the line of\r\nseparation between the dead and living structures. The crack deepens till\r\nthe parts below drop off without loss of blood, and frequently with very\r\nlittle pus. Ergot may cause serious irritation of the digestive tract, or\r\nby acting upon the nervous system it may cause lethargy or paralysis. It\r\nalso operates to cause contraction of the uterus, and may thus cause\r\nabortion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Regarding the treatment, change of feed and local antiseptics\r\nare, of course, indicated. The former may be useful as a preventive, but\r\nwhen the symptoms have appeared the animal is necessarily so completely\r\nsaturated that recovery is likely to be tedious. Tannin may be given\r\ninternally in doses of one-half dram twice daily for a few days to\r\nneutralize the unabsorbed alkaloids of the ergot. At the same time give\r\ncastor oil. To dilate the blood vessels give chloral hydrate. Bathe the\r\naffected parts with hot water. If sloughing has gone far, amputation must\r\nbe resorted to.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER POISONOUS FUNGI.\r\n\r\nMany other fungi poison herbivora. In some instances, however, where fungi\r\nare blamed for causing disease their presence on the feedstuff or herbage\r\nis but coincidental with some other and more potent disease-producing\r\nfactor. For example, if the conditions are favorable to the growth of fungi\r\nthey are also favorable to the growth of bacteria, and bacteria may produce\r\npoisons in feeds. In general it may be said that any feed that is moldy,\r\nmusty, or putrid is possibly dangerous. Silage, properly cured, does not\r\nbelong to this class, because the curing of silage is not a bacterial\r\nprocess. But spoiled silage and silage matted with mold is dangerous and\r\nshould not be fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING BY ANIMAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nSNAKE BITES.\r\n\r\nThe poison contained in the tooth glands of certain venomous reptiles,\r\nparticularly some of the snakes, which is injected into or under the skin\r\nof an animal bitten by the reptile, is a very powerful agent. It is likely\r\nto produce a serious local irritation, and in the case of the more\r\npoisonous snakes serious constitutional disturbances, even to causing\r\ndeath, which it may do in either of two ways: First, when very strong, by\r\nexerting a narcotic influence similar to that of some of the powerful\r\npoisons, checking heart action. Second, by diffused inflammation of the\r\nareolar tissue, gangrene, and extensive sloughing.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of snake bite are a local swelling caused by an\r\nintense local inflammation, pricks showing where the fangs penetrated,\r\ndepression, weakness, feeble pulse, difficult breathing, bluish\r\ndiscoloration of the visible mucous membranes, stupor, or convulsions. If\r\nthe poison is not powerful or plentiful enough to produce death, it is, at\r\nany rate, likely to cause severe local abscesses or sloughs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment may be divided into local and general. Locally\r\nevery effort should be made to prevent absorption of the poison. If\r\ndiscovered at once the bitten part had better be excised. If that is\r\nimpracticable and a ligature can be applied, as in the case of a bite to\r\none of the limbs, no time should be lost in applying it above the injury.\r\nIt should be made sufficiently tight to so far as possible arrest\r\ncirculation in the bitten part. The wound should be freely incised, so that\r\nit will bleed freely, and the poison should be extracted by cupping, or\r\npressed out by squeezing with the fingers. Permanganate of potassium in 5\r\nper cent solution should be applied to and injected into the wound. The\r\ndepressing effect of the poison on the general system should be\r\ncounteracted by hypodermic injections of strychnin, or by liberal drenching\r\nwith stimulants, such as coffee, digitalis, or the aromatic spirits or\r\ncarbonate of ammonia. In animal practice the alcoholic stimulants and local\r\ntreatment above described are likely to meet with best success. A special\r\nantitoxin for use in treating snake bite is now prepared and may be had\r\nfrom the leading druggists. It is quite effective if used promptly.\r\n\r\n\r\nWASP AND BEE STINGS.\r\n\r\nWasps and bees secrete a poisonous substance which they are able to insert\r\nthrough the skin of an animal by the aid of their sharp stings. This poison\r\nis a severe local irritant and may even cause local gangrene. It also has a\r\ndepressing effect upon the central nervous system and destroys the\r\nred-blood corpuscles. To produce these general effects it must be\r\nintroduced in very large quantities, as when an animal is stung by a swarm\r\nof bees or wasps.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment is to wash the parts with diluted ammonia or\r\npermanganate of potassium solution and to give stimulants internally. If\r\nthere is so much swelling about the head and nostrils as to interfere with\r\nbreathing, tracheotomy may be necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONING WITH SPANISH FLY.\r\n\r\nSpanish fly, in the form of powdered cantharides, may be given in an\r\noverdose, or when applied as a blister to too large a surface of skin\r\nenough may be absorbed to poison. If given by the mouth, it causes severe\r\nirritation of the gastrointestinal tract, shown by salivation, sore throat,\r\ncolic, bloody diarrhea, etc. It also produces, whether given by the mouth\r\nor absorbed through the skin, irritation of the urinary tract, as shown by\r\nfrequent and painful urination. If death results, it is due to respiratory\r\nparalysis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give protectives and the white of egg, with opium. Do not\r\ngive oils or alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE HEART, BLOOD VESSELS, AND\r\nLYMPHATICS.\r\n\r\nBy W. H. HARBAUGH, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CIRCULATORY SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nIn cattle, as in human beings, the heart, blood vessels, and lymphatics may\r\nbe described as the circulatory apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe heart is in the thoracic cavity (chest). It is conical in form, with\r\nthe base or large part uppermost, while the apex, or point, rests just\r\nabove the sternum (breastbone). It is situated between the right and left\r\nlungs, the apex inclining to the left, and owing to this the heart beats\r\nare best felt on the left side of the chest, behind the elbow. The heart\r\nmay be considered as a hollow muscle, containing four compartments, two on\r\neach side. The upper compartments are called auricles and the lower ones\r\nventricles. The right auricle and ventricle are completely separated from\r\nthe left auricle and ventricle by a thick septum or wall, so that there is\r\nno communication between the right and left sides of the organ.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of each auricle is the auriculo-ventricular opening, each\r\nprovided with a valve to close it when the heart contracts to force the\r\nblood into the arteries. In the interval between the contractions these\r\nvalves hang down into the ventricles.\r\n\r\nThe muscular tissue of the heart belongs to that class known as\r\ninvoluntary, because its action is not controlled by the will.\r\n\r\nThe cavities of the heart are lined by a serous membrane, called the\r\nendocardium, which may be considered as a continuation of the veins and the\r\narteries, forming their internal lining. The walls of the ventricles are\r\nthicker than those of the auricles, and the walls of the left ventricle are\r\nmuch thicker than those of the right.\r\n\r\nThe heart is enveloped by a fibrous sac (or bag), called the pericardium,\r\nwhich assumes much of the general shape of the outer surface of the heart.\r\n\r\nThe action of the heart is similar to that of a pump and its function is to\r\nkeep the blood in circulation. The auricles may be considered as the\r\nreservoirs or receivers of the blood and the ventricles as the pump\r\nchambers. During the interval between contractions, the heart being in\r\nmomentary repose, the blood pours into the auricles from the veins; the\r\nauriculo-ventricular orifices being widely open, the ventricles also\r\nreceive blood; the auricles contract and the ventricles are filled;\r\ncontraction of the ventricles follows; the auriculo-ventricular valves are\r\nforced up by the pressure of the blood and close the auriculo-ventricular\r\nopenings and prevent the return of blood into the auricles; the contraction\r\nof the ventricles forces the blood from the right ventricle into the lungs\r\nthrough the pulmonary artery and its branches, and from the left ventricle\r\ninto the aorta, thence through the arteries to all parts of the body. After\r\nthe contraction of the ventricles the heart is again in momentary repose\r\nand is being filled with blood, while the valves in the aorta and pulmonary\r\nartery close to prevent the return of blood into the ventricles. (See Pl.\r\nVII.)\r\n\r\nThe average weight of the heart of an ox is said to be from 3-1/2 to 5\r\npounds; but, of course, owing to the many breeds and sizes of cattle, it\r\nmust vary in different animals.\r\n\r\nThe vessels that convey the blood from the heart to all parts of the body\r\nare called arteries; those which return the blood to the heart are called\r\nveins. The arteries divide and subdivide (like the branches of a tree),\r\nbecome smaller and smaller, and ultimately ramify into every part of the\r\nbody. Between the ultimate ramifications of the arteries and the beginning\r\nof the veins there is an intermediate system of very minute vessels called\r\ncapillaries, which connect the arterial with the venous system of the\r\ncirculation. The walls of the arteries are possessed of a certain amount of\r\nrigidity, sufficient to keep the tubes open when they are empty.\r\n\r\nThe blood leaves the left ventricle through a single vessel, the common\r\naorta, consisting of the anterior and posterior aortas, which give off the\r\nlarge arteries.\r\n\r\nThe veins take the blood from the capillaries in all parts of the body.\r\nThey begin in very small tubes, which unite to become larger in size and\r\nless in number as they approach the heart.\r\n\r\nIn its course an artery is usually accompanied with a vein and in many\r\nsituations with a nerve. The more important arteries are placed deep within\r\nthe body; when they are superficial, however, they are generally found\r\nwhere least exposed to injury, as, for example, on the inner side of the\r\nlegs. Arteries are less numerous than veins, and their total capacity is\r\nmuch less than that of the veins. A great number of veins are in the tissue\r\nimmediately beneath the skin and do not generally accompany arteries.\r\n\r\nThe blood, throughout its course in the heart, arteries, capillaries, and\r\nveins, is inclosed within these vessels. Except where the large lymphatics\r\nempty into the venous blood, there is no opening into the course of the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nAll the arteries except the pulmonary and its branches carry bright-red\r\nblood, and all the veins, except the pulmonary veins, carry dark-red blood.\r\nThe impure dark-red blood is collected from the capillary vessels and\r\ncarried to the right auricle by the veins; it passes down into the right\r\nventricle, and thence into the pulmonary artery and through its branches to\r\nthe capillaries of the lungs, where the carbonic-acid gas and other\r\nimpurities are given up to the air in the air cells of the lungs (through\r\nthe thin walls between the capillaries and the air cells), and where it\r\nalso absorbs from the air the oxygen gas necessary to sustain life. This\r\ngas changes it to the bright-red, pure blood. It passes from the\r\ncapillaries to the branches of the pulmonary veins, which convey it to the\r\nleft auricle of the heart; it then passes through the auriculo-ventricular\r\nopening into the left ventricle, the contraction of which forces it through\r\nthe common aorta into the posterior and anterior aortas, and through all\r\nthe arteries of the body into the capillaries, where it parts with its\r\noxygen and nutritive elements and where it absorbs carbonic-acid gas and\r\nbecomes dark colored. (See theoretical diagram of the circulation, Pl.\r\nVII.)\r\n\r\nThe branches of certain arteries in different parts unite again after\r\nsubdividing. This reuniting is called anastomosing, and assures a quota of\r\nblood to a part if one of the anastomosing arteries should be tied in case\r\nof hemorrhage, or should be destroyed by accident or operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of food, after being digested in the alimentary canal,\r\nare absorbed and carried into the blood by the lymphatics, and by the blood\r\nto the places where nutrition is required. The blood takes from all parts\r\nof the body all that is no longer required, and carries it to the different\r\norgans through which it is eliminated from the body. It contains within\r\nitself all the elements which nourish the body.\r\n\r\nThe blood may be considered as a fluid holding in solution certain\r\ninorganic elements and having certain bodies suspended in it. To facilitate\r\ndescription, the blood may be considered as made up of the corpuscles and\r\nthe liquor sanguinis. The corpuscles are of two kinds, the red and the\r\nwhite, the red being the more numerous. The color of the blood is caused by\r\nthe coloring matter in the red corpuscles, which are the oxygen carriers.\r\nBoth kinds are very minute bodies, which require the aid of the microscope\r\nto recognize them. The liquor sanguinis is composed of water containing in\r\nsolution salts, albumen, and the elements of fibrin.\r\n\r\nThe lymphatics, or absorbents, are the vessels which carry the lymph and\r\nchyle in the blood. They begin as capillaries in all parts of the body,\r\ngradually uniting to form larger trunks. Placed along the course of the\r\nlymphatic vessels are glands, in some situations collected into groups; for\r\nexample, in the groin. These glands are often involved in inflammation\r\narising from the absorption of deleterious matter.\r\n\r\nAbsorption is the function of the lymphatics. The liquor sanguinis passes\r\nfrom the blood capillaries to supply nutrition to the tissues. All of the\r\nliquor sanguinis that is not required is absorbed by the lymphatic vessels\r\nand conveyed back to the blood by the lymphatic ducts. The lymphatics which\r\nproceed from the intestines convey the chyle into the blood during\r\ndigestion. As a rule, the lymphatic vessels follow the course of the veins.\r\nAll the absorbent vessels convey their contents to the thoracic duct and\r\nright great lymphatic vein, which empty into the anterior vena cava, where\r\nthe lymph and chyle mix with the venous blood, and thus maintain the supply\r\nof nutritive elements in the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PULSE.\r\n\r\nAs fully explained, the heart pumps the blood throughout the arterial\r\nsystem. The arteries are always full and each contraction of the ventricle\r\npumps more blood into them; this distends their elastic walls and sends\r\nalong them a wave which gradually becomes less perceptible as it nears the\r\nvery small arteries. This wave constitutes the pulse, and is lost before\r\nthe capillaries are reached. The sensation or impression given to the\r\nfinger when placed upon the artery shows the force exerted by the heart and\r\nsome important facts concerning the condition of the circulation. In adult\r\ncattle the average number of pulsations in a minute is from 50 to 60. The\r\npulse is faster than normal after exercise, excitement, on hot days, from\r\npain, and as a result of fullness of the stomach. In old animals it is\r\nslower than in the young and in males slightly slower than in females. In\r\nfevers and inflammations and in local diseases of the heart the pulse rate\r\nis increased. If the rate is greater than 100 or 110 to the minute the\r\noutlook for recovery is not good.\r\n\r\nOther variations of the pulse are known as infrequent pulse, which means\r\nthat the number of pulsations in a given time is less than normal. The\r\nirregular or the intermittent pulse is when the pulsations do not follow in\r\nregular order. The large pulse and the small pulse refer to the volume of\r\nthe pulse, which may be larger or smaller than usual. The strong pulse and\r\nthe feeble pulse refer to the strength or weakness of the pulsation. The\r\npulse is said to be hard when the vessel feels hard and incompressible, the\r\nsoft pulse being the opposite. By dicrotic pulse is meant that kind of\r\npulsation which makes each beat seem double, and therefore it is generally\r\ncalled the double pulse.\r\n\r\nThe venous or \"jugular pulse\" is the pulsation so frequently observed in\r\nthe jugular vein of cattle and is particularly noticeable while they are\r\nruminating--\"chewing the cud.\" It is not always associated with disease,\r\nbut may be a symptom of some disease of the heart; in such cases the\r\njugular pulse is continuous.\r\n\r\nThe place selected for feeling the pulse in cattle is where the\r\nsubmaxillary artery winds around the lower jawbones, just at the lower edge\r\nof the flat muscle on the side of the cheek; or, if the cow is lying down,\r\nthe metacarpal artery on the back part of the fore fetlock is very\r\nconvenient for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nCorresponding to the beats of the heart two sounds are emitted which are of\r\na definite type in healthy animals. The first is produced by the\r\ncontraction of the heart and the flow of blood out of it; the second is\r\ncaused by the rebound of blood in the aorta and the closure of the valves\r\nthat prevent it from flowing backward into the heart, whence it came. The\r\nfirst sound is the longer and louder of the two, though of low pitch. The\r\nsecond sound is sharper and shorter, and is not always easy to hear. There\r\nis a brief interval between them.\r\n\r\nTo distinguish these sounds, the ear is placed against the left side of the\r\nchest, a little above the point where the elbow rests when the animal is\r\nstanding in a natural position, and about opposite the sixth rib. Both\r\nheart sounds are reduced in intensity when the animal is weak or when the\r\nheart is forced away from the chest wall by collections of fluid or by\r\ntubercular or other growths. Nonrhythmical heart sound is often caused by\r\npericarditis or by disease of the valves. It may also be attributable to\r\noverfilling of the heart upon the right side, as occurs in severe\r\ncongestion of the lungs and in some febrile diseases.\r\n\r\nIn pericarditis, sounds like scraping, rubbing, or splashing may be heard,\r\nentirely apart from the two normal sounds above described.\r\n\r\nThe impulse of the heart, as felt by placing the hand against the chest, is\r\nof some consequence in reaching a conclusion in respect to disease of the\r\nheart; but it must be remembered that the impulse may be very much\r\nincreased by diseases other than those of the heart, as, for example,\r\ninflammation of various organs, severe pains, etc. The impulse may be\r\nincreased also (when disease does not exist) by work, exercise, fright, or\r\nany cause of excitement, or, in general, by anything that causes\r\nacceleration of the pulse.\r\n\r\nThe impulse of the heart may be felt and the sounds may be heard fairly\r\nwell in lean cattle, but in fat ones it is difficult and often impossible\r\nto detect either impulse or sound with any degree of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALPITATION.\r\n\r\nWhen the impulse of the heart is excessive--that is, when it beats more or\r\nless tumultuously--the familiar expression \"palpitation of the heart\" is\r\napplied; by many it is called \"thumps.\" The hand or ear placed against the\r\nchest easily detects the unnatural beating. In some cases it is so violent\r\nthat the motion may be seen at a distance. Palpitation is but a symptom,\r\nand in many instances not connected with disease of the structure of the\r\nheart or its membranes. A badly frightened animal may have palpitation.\r\nWhen it comes on suddenly and soon passes away, it depends on some cause\r\nother than diseases of the heart; when it is gradually manifested, however,\r\nand becomes constant, although more pronounced at one time than another,\r\nheart disease may be suspected, especially if other symptoms of heart\r\ndisease are present.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURY TO THE HEART BY FOREIGN BODIES.\r\n\r\nCattle are addicted to the habit of chewing and swallowing many objects not\r\nintended as articles of food. Every veterinarian of experience has met with\r\ninstances to remind him of this, and it is well known to butchers. Among\r\nthe great variety of things that have thus found their way into the\r\nstomachs of cattle the following have been noticed: Finger rings, knitting\r\nneedles, old shoes, table knives, wood, pieces of leather, pieces of wire,\r\nbuttons, hairpins, brushes, nails, coins, etc. The more sharply pointed\r\nobjects sometimes penetrate the wall of the stomach, in some cases causing\r\ngastric irritation enough to produce indigestion, gradually work their way\r\nthrough the diaphragm toward the heart, pierce the pericardium (bag\r\ninclosing the heart), wound the heart, and thus prove fatal to the animal.\r\nCases are recorded in which the foreign body has actually worked its way\r\ninto one of the cavities of the heart. Instances are known, however, in\r\nwhich the object took a different course, and finally worked its way toward\r\nthe surface and was extracted from the wall of the chest. While it is\r\npossible that the foreign body may pierce the wall at different parts of\r\nthe alimentary canal, as it frequently does that of the rumen (paunch), it\r\nis thought that in most cases it passes through the wall of the reticulum\r\n(smaller honeycombed compartment, or second stomach) and is drawn toward\r\nthe heart by the suctionlike action of the chest. Post-mortem examinations\r\nhave demonstrated the course it pursued, as adhesions and other results of\r\nthe inflammation it caused were plainly to be seen. All manner of symptoms\r\nmay precede those showing involvement of the heart, depending upon the\r\nlocation of the foreign body and the extent of inflammation caused by it.\r\nSevere indigestion may occur; stiffness and difficulty in moving about\r\nowing to the prods of the sharp body following muscular contraction; pain\r\non pressure over the front, lower, or right side of the abdomen; coughing\r\nand difficult, quick breathing. In most cases the foreign body does not\r\npenetrate to the heart, nor even to the pericardium.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are as follows: The animal is disinclined to move\r\nactively, the step is restricted and cautious, sudden motion causes\r\ngrunting, the attitude is constrained, the feet are drawn somewhat\r\ntogether, the back is arched, the face has an anxious expression. If the\r\ndisease is of several days' standing, there is likely to be soft swelling\r\n(edema) beneath the neck, in the dewlap, and under the chest, between the\r\nfore legs. Breathing is short and difficult; it may clearly be painful. The\r\npulse is rapid, 80 to 120 per minute. The muscles quiver as though the\r\nanimal were cold. Rumination and appetite are depressed or checked. The\r\ndung is hard, and to void it appears to cause pain. These symptoms usually\r\ndevelop gradually, and, of course, they vary considerably in different\r\nanimals, depending upon the size and location of the foreign body and the\r\nirritation it causes.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, in such cases treatment is useless, but when it is\r\npossible to diagnose correctly the animal could be turned over to the\r\nbutcher before the flesh becomes unfit for use; that is, before there is\r\nmore than a little suppuration and before there is fever. Knowing that\r\ncattle are prone to swallow such objects, ordinary care may be taken in\r\nkeeping their surroundings as free of them as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERICARDITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the pericardium (heart bag) is often associated with\r\npneumonia and pleurisy, rheumatism, and other constitutional diseases, or\r\nwith an injury. It also occurs as an independent affection, owing to causes\r\nsimilar to those of other chest affections, as exposure to cold or dampness\r\nand changes of the weather.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It may be ushered in with a chill, followed by fever, of more\r\nor less severity; the animal stands still and dull, with head hanging low,\r\nand anxiety expressed in its countenance. The pulse may be large, perhaps\r\nhard; there is also a venous pulse. The hand against the chest will feel\r\nthe beating of the heart, which is often irregular, sometimes violent, and\r\nin other instances weak, depending in part upon the quantity of fluid that\r\nhas transuded into the pericardial sac. The legs are cold, the breathing\r\nquickened and usually abdominal; if the left side of the chest is pressed\r\non or struck, the animal evinces pain. There may be spasms of the muscles\r\nin the region of the breast, neck, or hind legs. After a variable time\r\nswelling may also appear in the legs and under the chest and brisket.\r\n\r\nIn those animals in which the heart sounds may be heard somewhat\r\ndistinctly, the ear applied against the chest will detect a to-and-fro\r\nfriction sound, corresponding to the beats of the heart. This sound is\r\nproduced by the rubbing of the internal surface of the heart bag against\r\nthe external surface of the heart. During the first stages of the\r\ninflammation these surfaces are dry, and the rubbing of one against the\r\nother during the contraction and relaxation of the heart produces this\r\nsound. The dry stage is followed by the exudation of fluid into the heart\r\nsac, and the friction is not heard until the fluid is absorbed sufficiently\r\nto allow the surfaces to come in contact again. But during the time the\r\nfriction sound is lost a sound which has been called a \"churning noise\" may\r\ntake its place.\r\n\r\nThe friction sound of pericarditis can not be mistaken for the friction\r\nsound of pleurisy if the examination is a careful one, because in the heart\r\naffection the sound is made in connection with the heart beats, while in\r\nthe pleuritic affection the sound is synchronous with each respiration or\r\nbreath of air taken in and expelled from the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When pericarditis is complicated with rheumatism or other\r\ndiseases the latter must be treated as directed in the description of them.\r\nThe animal must be kept in a quiet, comfortable place, where it will be\r\nfree from excitement. Warm clothing should be applied to the body, and the\r\nlegs should be hand-rubbed until the circulation in them is reestablished,\r\nand then they should be snugly bandaged. The food should be nutritive and\r\nin moderate quantity. Bleeding should not be performed unless the case is\r\nin the hands of an expert.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning give as a purgative Epsom salt--1 pound to an\r\naverage-sized cow--dissolved in about a quart of warm water and\r\nadministered as a drench. When there is much pain 2 ounces of laudanum,\r\ndiluted with a pint of water, may be given every three hours until the\r\nanimal is better. Do not give the laudanum unless demanded by the severity\r\nof the pain, as it tends to constipate. Give one-half ounce of nitrate of\r\npotassium (saltpeter), dissolved in drinking water, four or five times a\r\nday. After the attack has abated mustard mixed with water may be rubbed\r\nwell over the left side of the chest to stimulate the absorption of the\r\nfluid within the pericardium. The other medicines may be discontinued and\r\nthe following administered: Sulphate of iron, 2 ounces; powdered gentian,\r\n6 ounces; mix and make 8 powders. Give one powder every day at noon, mixed\r\nwith feed, if the animal will eat it, or shaken up with water in a bottle\r\nas a drench. Also the following: Iodid of potassium, 2 ounces; nitrate of\r\npotassium, 8 ounces; mix and make 16 powders. Give one in drinking water\r\nor in drench every morning and evening. The last two prescriptions may be\r\ncontinued for several weeks if necessary.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cases tapping the pericardium with a trocar and cannula to draw\r\noff the fluid is resorted to, but the operation requires exact anatomical\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter death from pericarditis there is always more or less fluid found in\r\nthe pericardium; the surfaces are rough and covered with a yellow-colored\r\nexudate. There are also in many cases adhesions to a greater or less extent\r\nbetween the heart and pericardium.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYOCARDITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the muscular structure of the heart occurs in limited,\r\ncircumscribed areas, as evidenced by post-mortem examination, and it is\r\nprobably always somewhat involved in connection with pericarditis and\r\nendocarditis. It may readily be inferred that if the whole organ were\r\ninflamed death would ensue immediately. Usually myocarditis results from\r\nthe preexistence of blood poisoning or of some infectious febrile disease.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The chief symptoms are those of heart weakness. The heart beat\r\nis fast, weak, and often irregular. Respiration is difficult and rapid.\r\nThere is great general weakness and depression. Death comes suddenly.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in supporting the animal by the use of\r\nstimulants, such as ammonia, coffee, digitalis, camphor, etc. Complete\r\nquiet must be provided, and the general care should be as in pericarditis.\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOCARDITIS.\r\n\r\nWhen the membrane which lines the cavities of the heart--the endocardium--\r\nsuffers inflammation, the disease is called endocarditis. The cause is\r\nanother disease, during which substances that irritate the lining of the\r\nheart are produced and admitted into the circulation. These substances are\r\nusually living organisms, or it is possible that in some cases they are\r\nchemical irritants. Endocarditis occurs as a complication of or sequel to\r\npneumonia, blood poisoning, inflammation of the womb, rheumatism, or severe\r\nwounds or abscesses. The symptoms are much the same as those of\r\npericarditis, and it is difficult to discriminate between the two\r\naffections. There is a jugular pulse, the legs may become dropsical, and\r\nthere is a tendency to faint if the head is elevated suddenly. The\r\nbellowslike sound is more distinct than it is in pericarditis. It is the\r\nmost fatal of heart diseases, because of the liability of the formation of\r\nclots, which may adhere to the valves, change in the structure of the\r\nvalves, and often a complication with an abnormal condition of the blood.\r\nClots may be formed in the heart, and, being carried to other parts, prove\r\nfatal by interrupting the circulation in some vital organ.\r\n\r\nTreatment similar to that advised for myocarditis may be followed in this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALVES OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThe valves are subject to abnormal growths and structural changes in\r\nchronic endocarditis or as a result of acute endocarditis. Sometimes valves\r\nare torn by sudden, extreme muscular effort or a congenital abnormality.\r\nCases are also reported in which they have been found ruptured.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The general symptoms are those of heart weakness, accompanied\r\nwith edema and congestion of the lungs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Relief is sometimes afforded, but usually only temporarily,\r\nby the use of stimulants, especially digitalis.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nSudden effort, blows, or disease may lead to rupture of the heart of the\r\nox. The first cause does not operate so often in cattle as in horses.\r\nTuberculosis or ulceration from other causes, such as a foreign body, is\r\nthe most common source of this accident. Rupture is shown by sudden\r\nfainting, followed very shortly by death.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYPERTROPHY AND DILATATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis is an enlargement of the heart, and may consist of the thickening of\r\nthe walls alone, or at the same time the cavities may be either enlarged or\r\ndiminished. Dilatation of the cavities has been noticed as existing\r\nindependently of thickened walls. In hypertrophy the sounds of the heart\r\nare loud and pronounced, may be heard on both sides of the chest\r\ndistinctly, and palpitation occurs to a greater or less extent. Fortunately\r\nboth conditions are very rare in cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nATROPHY.\r\n\r\nAtrophy is the technical term for wasting of the muscular tissue. Atrophy\r\nof the heart is very rare among cattle, and is usually a result of other\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nFATTY DEGENERATION OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nThis condition of the heart is met with in some very fat cattle, but it\r\nmust be understood that the accumulation of fat around the heart is not\r\nreferred to by this designation. In fatty degeneration the elements of the\r\nmuscular tissue are replaced by fatty or oily granules. The muscle becomes\r\nweak, the heart contractions are insufficient, and heart weakness is shown\r\nby general weakness, shortness of breath, and weak, rapid pulse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYANOSIS.\r\n\r\nOwing to the most prominent symptoms, cyanosis is also called \"blue\r\ndisease,\" and is seen occasionally in new-born calves. It is recognized by\r\nthe blue color of the mucous membrane (easily seen by looking within the\r\nmouth and nostrils), the coldness of the surface of the body, and rapid,\r\nlabored breathing. It is caused by non-closure of the foramen ovale,\r\nconnecting the right with the left side of the heart, and the consequent\r\nmixing of the venous with the arterial blood. Calves so affected live but a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISPLACEMENT OF THE HEART.\r\n\r\nCases are recorded in which the heart has been found out of its natural\r\nposition, sometimes even outside the chest. This is a congenital condition\r\nfor which there is no remedy. A heifer calf with the heart entirely outside\r\nthe thoracic cavity and beneath the skin in the lower part of the neck was\r\nkept for two years at the veterinary hospital of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, during which time it grew to be a well-developed cow.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF ARTERIES AND VEINS.\r\n\r\nWhen a blood vessel is opened a glance will tell whether it is an artery or\r\na vein by simply remembering that bright-red blood comes from arteries and\r\ndark-red from veins. When a vein or a very small artery is severed the\r\nblood flows from the vessel in a continuous and even stream, but when one\r\nof the larger arteries is severed the blood comes in intermitting jets or\r\nspurts corresponding to the beats of the heart. It is well to call\r\nattention to the fact that the dark-red blood which flows or oozes from a\r\nwound soon becomes bright red, because it gives up its carbonic-acid gas to\r\nthe air, and absorbs oxygen gas from the air, which is exactly the change\r\nit undergoes in the capillaries of the lungs.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment of wounds will be found in another section; here it\r\nis necessary only to refer briefly to some of the most practical methods\r\nused to arrest hemorrhages, as instances occur in which an animal may lose\r\nmuch strength from the loss of blood, or even bleed to death unless action\r\nis prompt.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING (HEMORRHAGE).\r\n\r\nThe severity of a hemorrhage depends upon the size of the vessel from which\r\nthe blood escapes, though it may be stated that it is more serious when\r\narteries are severed. If the wound in an artery is in the direction of its\r\nlength, the blood escapes more freely than if the vessel is completely\r\nsevered, because in the latter instance the severed ends retract, curl in,\r\nand may aid very much in arresting the flow. When the blood merely oozes\r\nfrom the wound, and even when it flows in a small stream, the forming of\r\nthe clot arrests the hemorrhage in a comparatively short time.\r\n\r\nSlight hemorrhages may be checked by the continuous application of cold\r\nwater, ice, or snow, to the wound, as cold causes contraction of the small\r\nvessels. Water from a hose may be thrown on a wound, or dashed on it from\r\nthe hand or a cup, or folds of cotton cloths may be held on it and kept\r\nwet. Ice or snow may be held against the wound, or they may be put into a\r\nbag and conveniently secured in position.\r\n\r\nHot water of an average temperature of 115∞ to 120∞ F. injected into the\r\nvagina or womb is often efficient in arresting hemorrhages from those\r\norgans. Tow, raw cotton, lint, or sponges may be forced into a wound and\r\nheld or bound there with bandages. This is an excellent method of checking\r\nthe flow of blood until the arrival of an expert. If the flow persists,\r\nthese articles may be saturated with tincture of iron, but it is not\r\nadvisable to use it unless necessary, as it is a caustic and retards\r\nhealing by causing a slough. In cases of necessity, the articles may be\r\nsaturated with vinegar, or tannic acid or alum dissolved in water may be\r\nused instead. Whatever article is used should be left in the wound\r\nsufficiently long to make sure that its removal will not be followed by a\r\nrenewal of the hemorrhage. Sometimes it must remain there one or two days.\r\n\r\nAn iron heated white and then pressed on the bleeding vessel for three or\r\nfour seconds is occasionally used. It should not be applied longer, or else\r\nthe charred tissue will come away with the iron and thus defeat the purpose\r\nof its application.\r\n\r\nCompression may be applied in different ways, but only the most convenient\r\nwill be mentioned. To many wounds bandages may easily be applied. The\r\nbandages may be made of linen, muslin, etc., sufficiently wide and long,\r\naccording to the nature of the wound and the region to be bandaged. Bed\r\nsheets torn in strips the full length make excellent bandages for this\r\npurpose. Cotton batting, tow, or a piece of sponge may be placed on the\r\nwound and firmly bound there with the bandages.\r\n\r\nMany cases require ligating, which is almost entirely confined to arteries.\r\nA ligature is a piece of thread or string tied around the vessel. Veins are\r\nnot ligated unless very large (and even then only when other means are not\r\navailable) on account of the danger of causing phlebitis, or inflammation\r\nof a vein. The ligature is tied around the end of the artery, but in some\r\ninstances this is difficult and it is necessary to include some of the\r\nadjacent tissue, although care should be taken not to include a nerve. To\r\napply a ligature, it is necessary to have artery forceps (tweezers or small\r\npincers may suffice) by which to draw out the artery in order to tie the\r\nstring around it. To grasp the vessel it may be necessary to sponge the\r\nblood from the wound so that the end will be exposed. In case the end of\r\nthe bleeding artery has retracted, a sharp-pointed hook, called a\r\ntenaculum, is used to draw it out far enough to tie. The ligature should be\r\ndrawn tightly, so that the middle and internal coats will be cut through.\r\n\r\nAnother method of checking hemorrhage is called torsion. It consists in\r\ncatching the end of the bleeding vessel, drawing it out a little, and then\r\ntwisting it around a few times with the forceps, which lacerates the\r\ninternal coats so that a check is effected. This is very effectual in small\r\nvessels, and is to be preferred to ligatures, because it leaves no foreign\r\nbody in the wound. A needle or pin may be stuck through the edges of the\r\nwound and a string passed around between the free ends and the skin (Pl.\r\nXXVII, fig. 10), or it may be passed around in the form of a figure 8, as\r\nis often done in the operation of bleeding from the jugular vein.\r\n\r\n\r\nANEURISM.\r\n\r\nA circumscribed dilatation of an artery, constituting a tumor which\r\npulsates synchronously with the beats of the heart, is called aneurism. It\r\nis caused by disease and rupture of one or two of the arterial coats. The\r\ntrue aneurism communicates with the interior of the artery and contains\r\ncoagulated blood. It is so deeply seated in cattle that treatment is out of\r\nthe question. Such abnormalities are ascribable to severe exertion, to old\r\nage, to fatty or calcareous degeneration, or to parasites in the blood\r\nvessels. Death is sudden when caused by the rupture of an aneurism of a\r\nlarge artery, owing to internal hemorrhage. Sometimes spontaneous recovery\r\noccurs. As a rule no symptoms are caused in cattle by the presence of\r\ndeep-seated aneurisms, and their presence is not known until after death.\r\n\r\nA false aneurism results from blood escaping from a wounded artery into the\r\nadjacent tissue, where it clots, and the wound, remaining open in the\r\nartery, causes pulsation in the tumor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROMBOSIS (OBSTRUCTION) OF THE ARTERIES.\r\n\r\nArteries become obstructed as a result of wounds and other injuries to\r\nthem, as those caused by the formation of an abscess or the extension of\r\ninflammation from surrounding structures to the coats of an artery.\r\nArteries are also obstructed by the breaking off of particles of a plug or\r\nclot, partly obstructing the aorta or other large artery. These small\r\npieces (emboli) are floated to an artery that is too small to permit them\r\nto pass and are there securely held, producing obstruction. These\r\nobstructions are shown by loss of power in the muscles supplied by the\r\nobstructed artery and by excitation of the heart and by respiration after\r\nexercise. The loss of power may not come into evidence until after\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--While standing still or when walking slowly the animal may\r\nappear to be normal, but after more active exercise a group of muscles, a\r\nleg, or both hind legs, may be handled with difficulty, causing lameness,\r\nand later there is practically a local paralysis. These symptoms disappear\r\nwith rest. In some cases the collateral circulation develops in time, so\r\nthat the parts receive sufficient blood and the symptoms disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF VEINS (PHLEBITIS).\r\n\r\nWhen bleeding is performed without proper care or with an unclean lancet,\r\ninflammation of the vein may result, or it may be caused by the animal\r\nrubbing the wound against some object. When inflammation follows the\r\noperation, the coats of the vein become so much enlarged that the vessel\r\nmay be felt hard and knotted beneath the skin, and pressure produces pain.\r\nA thin, watery discharge, tinged with blood, issues from the wound. The\r\nblood becomes coagulated in the vessel. In inflammation of the jugular the\r\ncoagulation extends from the wound upward to the first large branch.\r\nAbscesses may form along the course of the vein. The inflammation is\r\nfollowed by obliteration of that part in which coagulation exists. This is\r\nof small import, as cattle have an accessory jugular vein which gradually\r\nenlarges and accommodates itself to the increased quantity of blood it must\r\ncarry.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment for inflammation of the vein is to clip the\r\nhair from along the course of the affected vessel and apply a blister, the\r\ncerate of cantharides. Abscesses should be opened as soon as they form,\r\nbecause there is a possibility of the pus getting into the circulation.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of bleeding the instruments should be clean and free from\r\nrust. If the skin is not sufficiently opened, or when closing the wound the\r\nskin is drawn out too much, blood may accumulate in the tissue, and if it\r\ndoes it should be removed by pressing absorbent cotton or a sponge on the\r\npart. Care should also be used in opening the vein, so that the instrument\r\nmay not pass entirely through both sides of the vein and open the artery\r\nbeneath it.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE HEART, BLOOD VESSELS, AND LYMPHATICS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE.\r\n\r\nPLATE VII:\r\n\r\nDiagram illustrating the circulation of the blood.

V. S.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of disease in the human being the physician, in making\r\nhis diagnosis, is aided by both subjective and objective symptoms, but the\r\nveterinary physician, in a very large majority of cases, is obliged to rely\r\nalmost solely upon objective symptoms, and perhaps in no class of diseases\r\nis this more true than in the exploration of those under consideration.\r\nThis condition of affairs has a strong tendency to develop observation and\r\ndiscernment in the veterinarian, and not infrequently do we find that the\r\nsuccessful veterinary practitioner is a very accurate diagnostician. In\r\norder to make a differential diagnosis, however, it is not only necessary\r\nto know the structure and functions of the organs in health, but to adopt a\r\nrigid system of details of examination, without which successful results\r\ncan not be reached.\r\n\r\n_History._--The history of a case should always be ascertained so far as\r\npossible. The information obtained is sometimes unsatisfactory and not to\r\nbe depended upon, but even when this is the case it is advisable to weigh\r\nthe evidence from every point of view.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the history of every case it is always of primary\r\nimportance to ascertain the cause of illness. A knowledge of the origin and\r\ndevelopment of a disease is important, both in making a diagnosis and in\r\nformulating the treatment. Exposure to cold and dampness is frequently the\r\nexciting cause of affections of the organs of respiration.\r\n\r\nThe experienced practitioner is always sure to ascertain whether the\r\nparticular animal he is called on to attend is the only one in the stable\r\nor on the premises that is similarly affected. If several animals are\r\nsimilarly affected, the disease may have a common cause, which may or may\r\nnot be of an infectious nature.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that the experienced practitioner ascertains is what previous\r\ntreatment, if any, the animal has had. Medicine given in excessive doses\r\nsometimes produces symptoms resembling those of disease.\r\n\r\nThe hygienic and sanitary conditions must always be considered in\r\nconnection with the cause as well as the treatment of disease. Much of the\r\ndisease which occurs in large dairies and elsewhere could be prevented if\r\nowners and those in charge of animals had proper regard for the fundamental\r\nlaws of animal hygiene and modern sanitation. Disregard for these laws is\r\nthe cause of most of the diseases under consideration in this chapter.\r\n\r\n_Attitude and general condition._--The feeling of pain in animals suffering\r\nfrom serious affections of the organs of respiration is expressed to the\r\nclose observer in no uncertain language--by their flinching when the\r\npainful part is touched; by the care with which they move or lie down; by\r\nwalking or standing to \"favor\" the part; by the general attitude and\r\nexpression of the eye; by the distress and suffering apparent in the face;\r\nand by other evidences.\r\n\r\nThe general physical condition and attitude of the sick animal tell the\r\ncareful observer much that aids him in making a diagnosis and prognosis.\r\nCows suffering from affections of the organs of respiration usually assume\r\na position or attitude that is characteristic, well known to experienced\r\nstockmen, as well as to veterinarians. When an animal has a fever or is\r\nsuffering from an inflammation, the skin is one of the first parts to\r\nundergo a change that is apparent to the average observer, for it soon\r\nloses its elasticity and tone, and the hair becomes dry and staring.\r\n\r\nFrom the general condition or state of nutrition one is able to judge the\r\neffect that the disease has already had upon the animal and to estimate the\r\nstrength remaining available for its restoration to health; from the degree\r\nof emaciation one can approximate the length of time the animal has been\r\nill. The age and breed of the animal, as well as its constitution and\r\ntemperament, are among the things that have to be taken into account in\r\nmaking a diagnosis and in overcoming the disease.\r\n\r\n_The mucous membrane._--The mucous membrane should in all cases be\r\nexamined. It can be readily seen by everting the eyelids or by an\r\ninspection of the lining membrane of the nostrils.\r\n\r\nPaleness of the mucous membrane indicates weak circulation or poor blood\r\nand may result from disease, hemorrhage, or from inappropriate feed.\r\n\r\nIn healthy animals increased redness of the mucous membrane occurs from\r\npain, excitement, or severe exertion, and in such instances is always\r\ntransitory. In certain pathological conditions, such as fevers and\r\ninflammation, this condition of the mucous membrane will also be found. The\r\nincreased redness of the mucous membrane lasts during the duration of the\r\nfever or inflammation.\r\n\r\nA bluish or blue mucous membrane indicates that the blood is imperfectly\r\noxidized and contains an excess of carbon dioxid, and is seen in serious\r\ndiseases of the respiratory tract, such as pneumonia, and in heart failure.\r\n\r\n_The secretions._--The secretions may be diminished, increased, or\r\nperverted. In the early stage of an inflammation of a secretory organ its\r\nsecretion is diminished. In the early stage of pleurisy the serous membrane\r\nis dry, and as the disease advances the membrane becomes unnaturally moist.\r\nThe products of secretion are sometimes greatly changed in character from\r\nthe secretion in health, becoming excessively irritant and yielding\r\nevidence of chemical and other alterations in the character of the\r\nsecretion.\r\n\r\n_Cough._--Cough depends upon a reflex nervous action and may be primary\r\nwhen the irritation exists in the lungs or air passages, or secondary when\r\ncaused by irritation of the stomach, intestines, or other parts having\r\nnervous communications with the respiratory apparatus. A cough is said to\r\nbe dry, moist, harsh, hollow, difficult, paroxysmal, suppressed,\r\nsympathetic, etc., according to its character. It is a very important\r\nsymptom, often being diagnostic in diseases of the respiratory organs, but\r\nthis is a subject, however, which can be more satisfactorily treated in\r\nconnection with the special diseases of the organs in question.\r\n\r\n_Respiration._--In making an examination of an animal observe the depth,\r\nfrequency, quickness, facility, and the nature of the respiratory\r\nmovements. They may be quick or slow, frequent or infrequent, deep or\r\nimperfect, labored, unequal, irregular, etc., each of which indications has\r\nits significance to the experienced veterinarian.\r\n\r\nSleep, rumination, pregnancy in cows, etc., modify the respiratory\r\nmovements even in health. Respiration consists of two acts--inspiration and\r\nexpiration. The function of respiration is to take in oxygen from the\r\natmospheric air, which is essential for the maintenance of life, and to\r\nexhale the deleterious gas known as \"carbon dioxid.\"\r\n\r\nThe frequency of the respiratory movements is determined by observing the\r\nmotions of the nostrils or of the flanks. The normal rate of respiration\r\nfor a healthy animal of the bovine species is from 15 to 18 times a minute.\r\nThe extent of the respiratory system renders it liable to become affected\r\nby contiguity to many parts and its nervous connections are very important.\r\n\r\nRapid, irregular, or difficult breathing is known as dyspnea, and in all\r\nsuch cases the animal has difficulty in obtaining as much oxygen as it\r\nrequires. Among the conditions that give rise to dyspnea may be mentioned\r\nrestricted area of active lung tissue, owing to the filling of portions of\r\nthe lungs with inflammatory exudate, as in pneumonia; painful movements of\r\nthe chest, as in rheumatism or pleurisy; fluid in the chest cavity, as in\r\nhydrothorax; adhesions between the lungs and chest walls; compression of\r\nthe lungs or loss of elasticity; excess of carbon dioxid in the blood;\r\nweakness of the respiratory passages; tumors of the nose and paralysis of\r\nthe throat; swellings of the throat; foreign bodies and constriction of the\r\nair passages leading to the lungs; fevers, etc.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, it is only the careful and constant examination of\r\nanimals in health that will enable one properly to appreciate abnormal\r\nconditions. One must become familiar with the frequency and character of\r\nthe pulse and of the respirations and know the temperature of the animal in\r\nhealth, before changes in abnormal conditions can be properly appreciated.\r\n\r\n_Temperature._--The temperature should be taken in all cases of sickness.\r\nExperienced practitioners can approximate the patient's temperature with\r\nremarkable accuracy, but I strongly recommend the use of the\r\nself-registering clinical thermometer, which is a most valuable instrument\r\nin diagnosing diseases. (See Pl. III, fig. 1.) It is advisable to get a\r\ntested instrument, as some thermometers in the market are inaccurate and\r\nmisleading. The proper place to insert the thermometer is in the rectum,\r\nwhere the instrument should be rested against the walls of the cavity for\r\nabout three minutes. The normal temperature of the bovine is 101∞ to 102∞\r\nF., which is higher than that of the horse. A cow breathes faster, her\r\nheart beats faster, and her internal temperature is higher than that of\r\nthe horse. Ordinary physiological influences--such as exercise, digestion,\r\netc.--give rise to slight variations of internal temperature; but if the\r\ntemperature rises two or three degrees above the normal some diseased\r\ncondition is indicated.\r\n\r\n_Pulse._--The pulse in a grown animal of the bovine species in a state of\r\ngood health beats from 45 to 55 times a minute. Exercise, fright, fear,\r\nexcitement, overfeeding, pregnancy, and other conditions aside from disease\r\nmay affect the frequency and character of the pulse. It assumes various\r\ncharacters according to its rapidity of beat, frequency of occurrence,\r\nresistance to pressure, regularity, and perceptibility. Thus we have the\r\nquick or slow, frequent or infrequent, hard or soft, full or imperceptible,\r\nlarge or small pulse, the character of each of which may be determined from\r\nits name; also that known as the intermittent, either regular or irregular.\r\nWe may have a dicrotic, or double, pulse; a thready pulse, which is\r\nextremely small and scarcely perceptible; the venous, or jugular, pulse;\r\nthe \"running down\" pulse, and so on. (See p. 76.)\r\n\r\nIn cattle the pulse is conveniently felt over the submaxillary artery where\r\nit winds around the lower jawbone, just at the lower edge of the flat\r\nmuscle on the side of the cheek. If the cow is lying down the pulse may be\r\ntaken from the metacarpal artery on the back part of the fore fetlock. The\r\npulsations can be felt from any superficial artery, but in order to\r\nascertain the peculiarities it is necessary to select an artery that may be\r\npressed against a bone.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE VIII. Position of the Lung.]\r\n\r\nThere is a marked difference in the normal or physiological pulse of the\r\nhorse and that of the cow, that of the horse being full and rather tense,\r\nwhile in the cow it is soft and rolling. The pulse is faster in young or\r\nold cattle than it is in those of middle age.\r\n\r\n_Auscultation._--Auscultation and percussion are the chief methods used to\r\ndetermine the various pathological changes that occur in the respiratory\r\norgans. Auscultation is the act of listening, and may be either mediate or\r\nimmediate. Mediate auscultation is accomplished by aid of an instrument\r\nknown as the stethoscope, one extremity of which is applied to the ear and\r\nthe other to the chest of the animal. In immediate auscultation the ear is\r\napplied directly to the part. Immediate auscultation will answer in a large\r\nmajority of cases. Auscultation is resorted to in cardiac and certain\r\nabdominal diseases, but it is mainly employed for determining the condition\r\nof the lungs and air passages. Animals can not give the various phases of\r\nrespiration, as can the patients of the human practitioner. The organs\r\nthemselves are less accessible than in man, owing to the greater bulk of\r\ntissue surrounding them and the pectoral position of the fore extremities,\r\nall of which render it more difficult in determining pathological\r\nconditions. (See Pl. VIII.)\r\n\r\nThe air going in and out of the lungs makes a certain soft, rustling sound,\r\nknown as the vesicular murmur, which can be heard distinctly in a healthy\r\nstate of the animal, especially upon inspiration. Exercise accelerates the\r\nrate of respiration and intensifies this sound. The vesicular murmur is\r\nheard only where the lung contains air and its function is active. The\r\nvesicular murmur is weakened as inflammatory infiltration takes place and\r\nwhen the lungs are compressed by fluids in the thoracic cavity, and\r\ndisappears when the lung becomes solidified in pneumonia or the chest\r\ncavity filled with fluid as in hydrothorax. The bronchial murmur is a\r\nharsh, blowing sound, heard in normal conditions by applying the ear over\r\nthe lower part of the trachea, and may be heard to a limited extent in the\r\nanterior portions of the lungs after severe exercise. The bronchial murmur\r\nwhen heard over other portions of the lungs generally signifies that the\r\nlung tissue has become more or less solidified or that fluid has collected\r\nin the chest cavity.\r\n\r\nOther sounds, known as mucous r‚les, are heard in the lungs in pneumonia\r\nafter the solidified parts begin to break down at the end of the disease\r\nand in bronchitis where there is an excess of secretion, as well as in\r\nother conditions. Mucous r‚les are of a gargling or bubbling nature. They\r\nare caused by air rushing through tubes containing secretions or pus. They\r\nare said to be large or small as they are distinct or indistinct, depending\r\nupon the quantity of fluid that is present and the size of the tubes in\r\nwhich the sound is produced. According to their character they are divided\r\ninto dry and moist. The friction sound is produced by the rubbing together\r\nof roughened surfaces and is characteristic of pleurisy.\r\n\r\n_Percussion._--Percussion is that mode of examination by which we elicit\r\nsounds by striking or tapping over the part. It may be direct or indirect.\r\nIf the middle finger of the left hand is placed firmly on the chest and\r\nsmartly tapped or struck with the ends of the first three fingers of the\r\nright hand, the sound will be noticed to be more resonant and clear than\r\nwhen the same procedure is practiced on a solid part of the body. This is\r\nbecause the lungs are not solid, but are always, in health, well expanded\r\nwith air. In certain pulmonary diseases, however, as in pneumonia, they\r\nfill up and become solid, when percussion produces a dull sound, like that\r\non any other solid part of the animal. When fluid has collected in the\r\nlower part of the chest cavity the sound will also be dull on percussion.\r\nWhere there is an excess of air in the chest cavity, as in emphysema or in\r\npneumothorax, the percussion sound becomes abnormally loud and clear. By\r\npractice on healthy animals the character and boundaries of the sounds can\r\nbe so well determined that any variation from them will be readily\r\ndetected, and will sometimes disclose the presence of a diseased condition\r\nwhen nothing else will.\r\n\r\nPercussion is sometimes practiced with the aid of a special percussion\r\nhammer and an object known as a pleximeter to strike upon. A percussion\r\nhammer is made of rubber or has a rubber tip, so that when the pleximeter,\r\nwhich is placed against the side of the animal, is struck the impact will\r\nnot be accompanied with a noise. A percussion hammer and pleximeter may be\r\npurchased from any veterinary instrument maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARRH (COLD IN THE HEAD).\r\n\r\nNasal catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous membranes of the nostrils\r\nand upper air passages. Simple catarrh is not a serious disease in itself,\r\nbut if neglected is liable to be complicated with laryngitis, bronchitis,\r\npneumonia, plurisy, or other serious and sometimes fatal diseases of the\r\nrespiratory organs. Catarrh is a common disease among cattle. It is often\r\ncaused by sudden exposure to wet and cold after they have been accustomed\r\nto shelter. It may arise from inhalation of irritating gases. It is also\r\nsometimes produced by certain specific atmospheric conditions, and may\r\nassume an enzoˆtic form. It is very debilitating, and requires prompt and\r\njudicious treatment.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Redness of the mucous membranes of the nose and redness and\r\nwatering of the eyes are symptoms of nasal catarrh. The mucous membrane\r\nfirst becomes dry; afterwards a watery discharge appears, and later, in\r\nsevere cases, the discharge becomes mucopurulent. In mild cases there is\r\nlittle or no fever, but in severe ones it may run high. The animal becomes\r\ndull, languid, and is not inclined to move about, and the appetite may\r\nbecome impaired; there is also variable temperature of the horns and ears.\r\nIf in a cow giving milk the secretion diminishes, the mucus from the eyes\r\nand nose becomes thicker and yellower. Afterwards, as the symptoms increase\r\nin severity, the discharge becomes mucopurulent.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be housed in a well-ventilated place, with\r\ngood hygienic surroundings. In cold and damp weather it should be kept warm\r\nwith blanketing, and, in severe cases, hot, medicated inhalations given. If\r\nthe fever is high, it may be reduced by giving nitrate of potassium, from 1\r\nto 2 ounces, in the drinking water, three times daily. Diffusible\r\nstimulants are beneficial in most cases. Too much importance can not be\r\nattached to good nursing. There is no necessity to resort to the old system\r\nof bleeding, purging, or the use of powerful sedatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPISTAXIS (BLEEDING FROM THE NOSE).\r\n\r\nBleeding from the nostrils is rather rare in cattle. It may arise from any\r\none of a variety of causes, but usually results from disease or injury to\r\nthe mucous membranes or to violent exertions in coughing and sneezing. It\r\nis seldom serious. It generally occurs in drops from one nostril only,\r\naccompanied with sneezing, and without frothing. Bleeding from the lungs\r\ncomes from both nostrils, is bright red, frothy, and accompanied with a\r\ncough.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In many cases the bleeding will cease spontaneously and all\r\nthat is necessary is to keep the animal quiet and bathe the head and\r\nnostrils with cold water. The cause of the bleeding should be learned and\r\ngoverned accordingly in the treatment. In severe and exceptional cases,\r\nwhen the hemorrhage is persistent and long continued, the animal's head\r\nshould be tied to a high rack or beam and cold water or ice applied, or\r\nrecourse to styptic injections taken. If the hemorrhage is profuse and\r\npersistent, either a drench composed of 1-1/2 drams of acetate of lead\r\ndissolved in a pint of water or 1-1/2 drams of gallic acid dissolved in a\r\npint of water should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARYNGITIS (SORE THROAT).\r\n\r\nAn inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the larynx is known as\r\nlaryngitis. It may be either a primary or a secondary disease, complicated\r\nor uncomplicated. In the majority of cases it is attributable to some form\r\nof exposure, a sudden change from warm to cold surroundings, or exposure to\r\ncold storms. It may also result from inhaling irritating gases or from\r\nexternal violence. In an acute attack of laryngitis there is an elevation\r\nof temperature, pain on pressure over the region of the larynx, violent\r\nparoxysms of coughing, difficult and noisy respiration. The nostrils are\r\ndilated, the nose extended, and the animal has a frightened expression.\r\nThere is marked difficulty in swallowing.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists of fomentations and hot applications over\r\nthe throat. Stimulating liniments, mustard mixed with cold water and well\r\nrubbed in with a stiff brush, or other forms of counterirritation may be\r\napplied in severe cases. Hot inhalations should be frequently resorted to,\r\nand often afford much relief to the suffering animal. In this disease\r\nmedicines should be given so far as possible in the form of electuaries\r\n(soft solid) on account of the difficulty of deglutition. Large drafts of\r\nmedicines have a tendency to produce violent spells of coughing, and in\r\nthis way retard recovery. The subjoined formula for an electuary will be\r\nfound to answer the purpose in ordinary cases: Chlorate of potassium,\r\npulverized, 8 ounces; fluid extract of belladonna, 2 ounces; powdered\r\nopium, 1 ounce; powdered licorice root, 8 ounces; sirup, sufficient\r\nquantity; mix. Place a small tablespoonful of the mixture frequently on the\r\ntongue or back teeth. Or the following may be used instead: Aloes, powdered\r\nopium, and gum camphor in equal parts; mix. Rub an ounce on the molar teeth\r\nevery four or five hours. The bowels should be kept open and the diet\r\nshould be such as the patient can easily swallow. Warm, sloppy mashes,\r\nboiled oatmeal gruel, linseed tea, and the like are the most suitable\r\nsubstances. If suffocation be threatened during the course of the disease,\r\ntracheotomy should be performed without delay. The details of the operation\r\nare fully described under the head of \"Surgical operations.\" (See p. 289.)\r\n\r\nWhen the disease assumes a chronic form, strong counterirritation is\r\nindicated. A cantharides blister may be applied, or the following ointment\r\nused: Biniodid of mercury 1 part, lard 6 parts; mix. In some cases it will\r\nbe found necessary to repeat the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nBronchitis is an inflammation of the mucous membrane of the bronchial\r\ntubes. When a primary disease, it is generally the result of what is\r\ncommonly known as \"catching cold.\" It may be secondary to or complicated\r\nwith many of the diseases of the respiratory system. It may also be caused\r\nby breathing irritating gases, or by the introduction of foreign bodies\r\ninto the bronchial tubes, which sometimes results from injudicious and\r\ncareless drenching when the larynx is temporarily relaxed. It may be acute\r\nor chronic, and is divided, according to the seat of the inflammation, into\r\nbronchitis proper when the large tubes are affected, or capillary\r\nbronchitis when the trouble is in the smaller ones.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Loss of appetite, elevation of temperature, generally 104∞ or\r\n105∞ F. The inspiration is incomplete, short, and painful, and the\r\nexpiration is prolonged. The pulse is increased in frequency and is hard. A\r\ncharacteristic, painful cough is present, but it is paroxysmal and\r\nincomplete. Auscultation and percussion greatly aid us in a diagnosis. A\r\nnormal sound is given on percussion. On auscultation, in the early stages,\r\nrhonchus r‚les are detected if the larger tubes are affected, and sibilant\r\nr‚les if the smaller ones are affected. Later mucous r‚les are noted, and\r\nsometimes all sounds in certain parts are absent, owing to the plugging up\r\nof the tubes. This plugging, if extensive enough, is sometimes the cause of\r\ndeath, or death may result from extension of the disease to the lungs or\r\npleura.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be placed in a light, well-ventilated box,\r\nand the bowels kept in a soft condition by enemas, etc. Violent purgatives\r\nshould not be used. The body should be kept warm by blanketing. In the\r\nearly stages a draft composed as follows should be given three times daily:\r\nExtract of belladonna, 2 drams; solution of acetate of ammonium, 4 fluid\r\nounces; water, one-half pint. In the later stage of the disease the\r\nfollowing formula may be substituted and given twice daily: Carbonate of\r\nammonium, 3 drams; liquor hydrochlorate of strychnin, 2 fluid drams;\r\nspirits of nitrous ether, 1 fluid ounce; water, one-half pint.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the following is preferable to either of the above, and may\r\nbe given in a pint of linseed tea every four hours: Spirits of nitrous\r\nether, 1-1/2 ounces; aromatic spirits of ammonia, 2 ounces; powdered\r\ncamphor, 2 drams. The feed should be light and nutritious.\r\n\r\nBronchitis is liable to become chronic if not properly treated in the\r\nearliest stage. In this case remedial treatment is of little value.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.\r\n\r\nPleurisy is an inflammation of the serous membrane lining the chest cavity\r\nand enveloping the lungs. It is somewhat rare as an independent disease,\r\nbut it often complicates pneumonia; indeed, it is often caused by the same\r\ngerm that causes pneumonia--pneumococcus. It may arise from exposure to\r\ncold or wet or from external violence, and is usually present in some\r\ndegree in cases in which the ribs have been fractured with or without a\r\npenetrated wound.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the first stage there is great pain aggravated by movement,\r\nand the animal is usually stiff as though foundered, the pulse is quick and\r\nhard, the breathing abdominal, the chest being fixed so far as possible,\r\nthe inspiration short and jerky, the expiration longer. The pain is caused\r\nby the friction of the dry, inflamed pleural surfaces of the lung and chest\r\non each other. At this stage the ear detects a dry friction murmur,\r\nresembling somewhat the sound made by rubbing two pieces of sole leather\r\ntogether. Pressure between the ribs gives pain and usually causes the\r\nanimal to flinch and grunt. The muzzle is hot and dry, the mouth slimy, and\r\nthe secretions scanty. After a day or two the severity of the symptoms is\r\nmuch lessened, the temperature, which during the first days may have been\r\nas high as 106∞ F., falls to 103∞ or 104∞, the pain decreases, the\r\nstiffness disappears, and the patient eats a little. The pulse softens, but\r\nremains quicker than normal. Now, day by day the patient loses a little\r\nstrength, the friction sound disappears as the exudation moistens the\r\npleural surfaces; percussion now shows a horizontal line of dullness, which\r\nday by day rises higher in the chest, the respiration grows more frequent\r\nand labored, the countenance is anxious and haggard, the eyes sink somewhat\r\nin their sockets, and in unfavorable cases death occurs during the second\r\nor third week, from either asphyxia or heart failure.\r\n\r\nIn pleurisy, as in pneumonia, the elbows are usually turned outward. Care\r\nmust be taken to differentiate pleurisy from traumatic pericarditis (which\r\nsee). In the latter condition the area of dullness of the heart is much\r\nincreased, and usually a splashing sound is heard at each beat of the\r\nheart. Another diagnostic symptom of value is that in traumatic\r\npericarditis respiration is painful, not difficult, and the respiratory\r\nrate is very much increased on movement. In both conditions a considerable\r\nswelling of the dewlap may be noticed in the later stages.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give the same general care as recommended in bronchitis or\r\npneumonia. In the early stages give a febrifuge to reduce the fever, as\r\ndirected for pneumonia. For relief of the cough give electuary formula,\r\nwhich will be found in the treatment of laryngitis. The bowels must be kept\r\nrelaxed and the kidneys secreting freely. In the stage of effusion the\r\nfollowing should be given three times daily: Digitalis tincture, 1 ounce;\r\niodid of potassium, 30 to 60 grains; mix. Apply strong counterirritant to\r\nchest and put seton in dewlap. (See \"Setoning,\" p. 293.) If collapse of the\r\nlung is threatened, a surgical operation, termed paracentesis thoracis, is\r\nsometimes performed; this consists in puncturing the chest cavity and\r\ndrawing off a part of the fluid. The instruments used are a small trocar\r\nand cannula, which are introduced between the eighth and ninth ribs. The\r\nskin should be drawn forward so that the external wound may not correspond\r\nto the puncture of the chest, to prevent the entrance of air. Only a\r\nportion of the fluid should be removed. The animal gets immediate relief,\r\nbut it is generally only temporary, as the fluid has a tendency to\r\naccumulate again.\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\nPneumonia is an inflammation of the lung substance, and is divided into\r\nthree forms, viz, croupous, catarrhal, and interstitial. These various\r\nforms, however, can be differentiated only by the expert, and it is\r\ntherefore deemed necessary for the purpose of the present work to treat the\r\nsubject under the general head of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nThe causes of pneumonia in general are the same as those of the various\r\nother inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract. The germ is known as\r\na pneumococcus. The disease mostly follows congestion of the lungs, but may\r\nin rare cases have a parasitic origin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In the first stage, that of congestion, the disease is usually\r\nushered in by a chill, although this may not always be observed by the\r\nattendant. This is followed by an elevation of temperature, usually 105∞ to\r\n106∞ F., or it may be even higher. The respirations are quick and shallow;\r\nthe nostrils are dilated; the pulse is full and hard. Cough may or may not\r\nappear in this stage. The nose is hot and dry; the tongue sometimes\r\nprotrudes and is slimy; the coat is staring, and the skin dry and harsh.\r\nThe urine is usually diminished in quantity, high colored, and the bowels\r\nconstipated. The animal stands with the forelegs wide apart to facilitate\r\nrespiration. On auscultation crepitation will be observed over the portion\r\nof the lung affected. The sounds elicited on percussion are practically\r\nnormal in this stage.\r\n\r\nIn the second stage the temperature generally drops one or two degrees, and\r\nrespiration is performed with much difficulty. The cough is frequent and\r\npainful. The animal still stands with the forelegs wide apart and the\r\nelbows turned outward. If it assumes the recumbent position it rests on the\r\nsternum. All secretions are more or less suspended, particularly the milk\r\nin cows. The animal has a haggard appearance, and the pulse becomes small\r\nand wiry at this period. The extremities are hot and cold alternately; the\r\ncrepitation which was present in the first stage is now absent, and no\r\nsound on auscultation is heard, unless it is a slight wheezing or whistling\r\nnoise. On percussion dullness over the diseased lung is manifested,\r\nindicating consolidation. The lung has now assumed a characteristic\r\nliverlike appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the third stage, if the disease is to terminate favorably, the cough\r\nbecomes loose, the animal improves, the appetite returns, and the symptoms\r\nabove detailed rapidly subside; if, on the other hand, resolution is not\r\nprogressing, the lung substance degenerates, becomes clogged up, and ceases\r\nto function. In fatal cases the breath has a peculiar, fetid, cadaverous\r\nodor, and is taken in short gasps; the horns, ears, and extremities become\r\ncold and clammy, and the pulse is imperceptible. On auscultation, when\r\nsuppuration is taking place and the lung structure is breaking down, a\r\nbubbling or gurgling crepitation, caused by the passage of air through pus,\r\nis heard.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Good hygienic surroundings and good nursing are essential in\r\nconnection with the medical treatment. The probability of recovery depends\r\nlargely on the extent of the lung tissue involved, as well as on the\r\nintensity of the inflammatory process. In the early stage, when the fever\r\nis high, febrifuges should be given. If the pulse be strong and full,\r\naconite (Fleming's tincture, 1 to 2 drams, every four or five hours) may be\r\ngiven for a short time, but should be discontinued as soon as the fever\r\nbegins to abate. Aconite is a valuable drug in the hands of the intelligent\r\npractitioner, but my experience leads me to believe that not infrequently\r\nanimals are lost by its injudicious use, for in many febrile conditions it\r\nis positively contraindicated, owing to its action upon the heart. In a\r\nplethoric animal, with a strong, bounding pulse, bleeding may be resorted\r\nto instead of administering aconite. If the bowels are constipated,\r\ncalomel, 1 to 3 drams, which acts as a cathartic and a febrifuge, is\r\nadvisable. In the second stage diffusible stimulants are required, viz:\r\nSpirits of nitrous ether, 2 ounces; aromatic spirits of ammonia, 1 ounce;\r\nmix, and give in gruel three times daily. In some cases carbonate of\r\nammonia, 2 to 5 drams, has been found beneficial. Most practitioners apply\r\ncounterirritants, such as mustard plasters, turpentine, and ammonia\r\nliniment, or cantharides.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHYSEMA (HEAVES).\r\n\r\nEmphysema is a rupture of the minute air vesicles of the lung substance,\r\nand may be either interlobular or vesicular. There is an extreme\r\ninterference with respiration, inspiration being short and expiration\r\nprolonged. It is a nonfebrile condition, in which the appetite is not\r\ndecreased and the milk secretion is kept up. It may be caused by an attack\r\nof asthma or may result from chronic bronchitis. The disease can be\r\ndiagnosed by the marked interference with respiration. The animal, as a\r\nrule, is emaciated, has a staring coat, and is hidebound. If percussion is\r\nresorted to, the animal's chest will give a tympanic, drumlike sound. The\r\nnormal resonant sound is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The disease is incurable, and only a palliative form of\r\ntreatment can be carried out. The destruction of the animal is often\r\nadvisable, from a humane as well as from a financial point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\nPULMONARY CONGESTION.\r\n\r\nCattle that are overdriven or overworked are liable to pulmonary congestion\r\nin an acute form, and sometimes to pulmonary apoplexy. In such cases they\r\nshould be allowed to rest, and if the weather is hot, they should be put in\r\na shady place. Give stimulants internally, unload the venous side of the\r\nheart by bleeding, and apply stimulating applications to the legs, and\r\nbandage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMOPTYSIS.\r\n\r\nHemoptysis is a term used to signify bleeding from the lungs. The trouble\r\nmay result from a previous congestion of the lungs or from a breaking down\r\nof the lung substance, or from specific disorders.\r\n\r\nBleeding from the lungs comes from both nostrils and from the mouth. The\r\nblood is bright red, frothy, and accompanied with a cough, the flow being\r\nsomewhat profuse and intermingled with mucus. It may cease of its own\r\naccord. Internally hemostatics are indicated, and locally over the sides\r\ncold applications have a tendency to check the hemorrhage. A drench of\r\n1-1/2 drams of gallic acid dissolved in a pint of water should be given.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESS OF THE LUNG.\r\n\r\nAbscesses of the lung sometimes form during the course of or subsequent to\r\ntuberculosis or other diseases. An animal affected with abscess of the lung\r\nusually has a protracted, feeble cough and a general appearance of\r\nemaciation and anemia. The pulse is feeble and the breath foul. An\r\noffensive discharge from the lungs frequently occurs. Percussion and\r\nauscultation aid in making a diagnosis in this condition. The appetite is\r\npoor. Such animals go from bad to worse, and their prompt destruction\r\nwould, as a rule, be to the interest of the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROTHORAX.\r\n\r\nHydrothorax, or dropsy of the chest, is not a disease in itself, but is\r\nsimply a condition in which an effusion takes place in the chest cavity,\r\nand is the result or effect of some disease, mostly pleurisy. It can be\r\neasily diagnosed by physical signs. A loss of the respiratory murmur will\r\nbe noticed on auscultation, and on percussion dullness or flatness on a\r\nline as high as the effusion has taken place. When a large amount of\r\neffusion is present, tapping with the trocar and cannula is generally\r\nresorted to. The proper method of performing this operation will be found\r\nunder the head of \"Pleurisy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMOTHORAX.\r\n\r\nAn accumulation of gas in the pleural sac is known as pneumothorax. The\r\npresence of air may result from either an injury of the lung or a wound\r\ncommunicating from the exterior. The indications for treatment are to\r\nremove any foreign body that may have penetrated, to exclude the further\r\nentrance of the air into the cavity by the closure of the external opening,\r\nand to employ antiseptics and adhesive dressings. The air already in the\r\ncavity will in most cases be absorbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERMINOUS BRONCHITIS.\r\n\r\nThis is a disease that sometimes attacks young cattle when pastured in\r\nlow-lying meadows near rivers subject to flood. It is caused by a small\r\nworm, _Strongylus micrurus_, which lodges in large numbers in the trachea\r\nand bronchial tubes, giving rise to considerable irritation of the air\r\npassages and inflammation. Sometimes the strongyles lodge in large numbers\r\nin the windpipe, forming themselves into a ball, and thus choke the animal\r\nto death.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It is liable to attack a number of animals at once, and the\r\nweakest are the first to give way. The animal has a remarkably forcible\r\ncough, distressing, and of a special hacking and paroxysmal character. A\r\nstringy mucus is sometimes expelled during the spells of coughing. This\r\nmucus contains the _Strongylus micrurus_, which can be detected, or their\r\nova observed, under a low power of the microscope. The attack has a\r\nsubacute character and is very exhausting. The parasites, by becoming\r\nentwined in balls, seriously impede respiration, which is always remarkably\r\nlabored in this disease.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The affected calves should be placed in a dry stable,\r\nprotected from dampness, and subjected to fumigations of sulphurous\r\nanhydrid or chlorin gas. The liberation of chlorin gas is brought about by\r\nthe action of sulphuric acid, either on a mixture of chlorid of sodium and\r\nblack oxid of manganese or on bleaching powder. Sulphurous anhydrid may be\r\nprocured by burning sulphur. Some practitioners prescribe small doses of\r\nspirits of turpentine in linseed oil. The system requires good support, and\r\nthe diet should therefore be liberal and nutritious. Equal parts of\r\nsulphate of iron, gentian, and ginger make an excellent tonic.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Avoid pastures notorious for generating verminous\r\nbronchitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEURODYNIA.\r\n\r\nPleurodynia is a term applied to rheumatism of the intercostal muscles, the\r\napparent symptoms being very similar to those of pleurisy. The animal is\r\nstiff, is not inclined to turn around, and the ribs are kept in a fixed\r\nstate as much as possible. Pleurodynia may be distinguished from pleurisy\r\nby the coexistence of rheumatism in other parts and by the comparative\r\nabsence of fever, cough, the friction sound, and the effusion into the\r\nchest. The treatment for this affection is the same as that for rheumatism\r\naffecting other parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nBy W. H. HARBAUGH, V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by John E. Mohler, V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS SYSTEM.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system is the distinguishing feature of animal life. Without it\r\nthere can be no intelligence, no instinct, no sensibility, no perception;\r\nin fact, existence would be nothing more than vegetable life.\r\n\r\nThe senses--touch, taste, sight, hearing, smell--all depend on the nervous\r\nsystem. Motion depends on it. A muscle can not contract without receiving\r\nthe stimulus from the nervous system. For example, if a nerve passing from\r\na nerve center to a muscle is severed, the particular muscle that is\r\nsupplied by the cut nerve is paralyzed.\r\n\r\nThe nervous system is often studied in two divisions--the cerebrospinal\r\ndivision and the sympathetic division.\r\n\r\nThe cerebrospinal division consists of the brain and spinal cord, nerves,\r\nand ganglia. The nerves of this division convey the impulses of motion and\r\nsensation and supply all parts which are under the control of the will. For\r\nexample, the voluntary muscular tissue includes all the muscles which act\r\nas the will directs. Another example: If anything comes in contact with any\r\npart of the skin, the impression is immediately perceived. All the special\r\nsenses belong to this division.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic division consists of nerves and ganglia. The muscular\r\ntissue, which acts independently of the will--as, for example, the stomach,\r\nintestines, womb, blood vessels, ducts, etc.--is called involuntary\r\nmuscular tissue, and receives nervous stimulus from the sympathetic\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\nThe brain, spinal cord, and the ganglia are the central organs of the\r\nnervous system. The nerves conduct the nervous influence. The nerves\r\nterminate differently according to their function. The terminations are\r\ncalled end organs. The terminal end organs in the skin and other parts\r\nendowed with sensation receive the impressions, which are conveyed to the\r\nbrain, where they are appreciated. They are so sensitive that the most\r\ngentle zephyr is perceived. They are so abundant that the point of the\r\nfinest needle can not pierce the skin without coming in contact with them,\r\nand the sensation of pain is instantly conveyed to the brain. The terminal\r\nend organs of the nerves that supply the muscles are different, as they\r\ngive the impulse which is conveyed by the motor nerves to the elements\r\nwhich constitute the muscle, and this impulse is the excitation which\r\ncauses the muscle to contract. The terminal end organs of the special\r\nsenses of taste, smell, etc., receive their special impressions, and their\r\nrespective nerves carry the impressions to the brain.\r\n\r\nThere are two divisions of nerves, the afferent and efferent.\r\n\r\nThe afferent nerves are those which convey the impression to the nerve\r\ncenters. All the sensory nerves belong to this division.\r\n\r\nThe efferent nerves are those which convey the nervous impulse outward from\r\nthe nerve centers, and they are further classified according to the\r\nfunction of their respective centers. For example: Motor fibers carry the\r\nimpulse from the nerve center to a muscle to cause contraction. Vasomotor\r\nfibers carry the impulse to the muscular tissue in the blood vessels, which\r\nregulates their caliber. The secretory fibers convey the impulse to the\r\ncells of the glands and excite the activity of the gland, and its\r\nparticular product is secreted or evolved, as, for instance, milk in the\r\nmammary gland. Inhibitory fibers control or inhibit the action of the organ\r\nto which they are distributed, as, for instance, the heart.\r\n\r\nNerve centers may be considered as a collection or group of nerve cells.\r\nBoth the cerebrospinal and the sympathetic divisions have nerve centers.\r\nThe centers derive their special names from their functions. The brain is\r\nthe great center of the nervous system, as it is the center of intelligence\r\nand perception. The centers of all the special senses, as well as the\r\ncenters of various functions, are located in different parts of the brain.\r\nNerve centers also exist in the spinal cord and in connection with the\r\nsympathetic system.\r\n\r\nA nerve is a cord consisting of a certain number of fibers of nerve tissue,\r\ninclosed in a sheath of connective tissue. Nerves divide and subdivide,\r\nsending off branches, which ramify in all parts of the body, and, as they\r\nnear their terminations, they contain but one or two fibers.\r\n\r\nThe brain and spinal cord are contained within a bony canal, which forms a\r\nprotective covering for them.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord, or spinal marrow, lodged within the spinal canal, or\r\nhollow of the backbone, is continuous with the brain anteriorly, and\r\nterminates in a point in the sacrum (that part of the spinal column which\r\nimmediately precedes the tail). The spinal cord gives off branches at each\r\nof the spaces between the segments of the backbone. These branches form\r\nnerve trunks which carry both sensory and motor impressions and impulses.\r\nThe spinal cord is a grand nerve trunk to carry messages to or from the\r\nbrain and to and from the reflex centers contained within itself.\r\n\r\nThe brain is contained within the cavity of the skull and is continuous\r\nwith the spinal cord; there is nothing to mark the place where one leaves\r\noff and the other begins. The brain is the seat of reason and intelligence.\r\nVoluntary effort originates from the brain. Coordination, or harmony of\r\nmovement, is controlled by the rear portion of the brain, known as the\r\ncerebellum.\r\n\r\nThe meninges are the membranes, three in number, which envelop the brain\r\nand spinal cord, and separate them from the bones which form the walls of\r\nthe cranial cavity and spinal canal.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic, also called the ganglionic, division of the nervous system\r\nconsists of two chains of ganglia, reaching from the head to the tail,\r\nsituated beneath the spinal column, one on either side. The presence of the\r\nganglia or enlargements on the cords give them their chainlike appearance.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic nerves are closely connected with the cerebrospinal\r\nnerves, but are not under the control of the will.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES (STAGGERS).\r\n\r\nInflammation of the brain is technically termed encephalitis and of its\r\nmembranes cerebral-meningitis, but as both conditions usually occur\r\ntogether, and since it is practically impossible to distinguish one from\r\nthe other by the symptoms shown by the diseased animal, they may as well be\r\nconsidered together here as varieties of the same disease. Staggers, coma,\r\nfrenzy, etc., are terms that are sometimes applied to this disease in its\r\ndifferent forms or stages.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Severe blows on the head with a hard object, or the head coming\r\nviolently in contact with the ground or other hard substance in a fall, may\r\nbe followed by encephalitis. Irritation caused by tumors in the brain may\r\nproduce inflammation. Feed containing deleterious matters--for example,\r\nergot (see Pl. V) and other fungi which contain a narcotic principle--is\r\nthe most frequent cause of this affection, and hence it is often called\r\n\"grass staggers\" and \"stomach staggers.\" Highly nitrogenous feeds are\r\nblamed for causing this disease. Parasites, mineral and narcotic poisons,\r\nhot weather, and severe exertion or excessive excitement may cause this\r\ncondition. Inflammation of the brain may occur as a complication of some\r\ninfectious disease or may follow some forms of indigestion. In many\r\nlocalities certain plants have the reputation of causing staggers.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary much, but a careful observer will detect a\r\ntrouble connected with the nervous system without much uncertainty. The\r\nfirst signs may be those of frenzy, but generally at the start the animal\r\nis dull and sleepy, with little or no inclination to move about; the head\r\nmay be pressed against the wall or fence and the legs kept moving, as if\r\nthe animal were endeavoring to walk through the obstruction; the body,\r\nespecially the hind part, may be leaned against the side of the stall or\r\nstable, as if for support. The bowels are constipated; the urine, when\r\npassed, is small in quantity and darker in color than natural. There may be\r\ntrembling and even spasms of muscles in different parts. In the dull stage\r\nthe animal may breathe less frequently than is natural, and each breath may\r\nbe accompanied with a snoring-like sound. The pulse may be large and less\r\nfrequent than normal. If suddenly aroused from the drowsy state, the animal\r\nappears startled and stares wildly. When moving about it may stagger, the\r\nhind quarters swaying from side to side.\r\n\r\nIf delirium ensues, the cow is commonly said to be mad. She may bellow,\r\nstamp her feet, run about wildly, grate the teeth, froth at the mouth. If\r\nshe is confined in the stable, she rears and plunges; the convulsions are\r\nso violent in many instances that it is really dangerous for one to attempt\r\nto render aid. The body may be covered with perspiration. She may fall; the\r\nmuscles twitch and jerk; often the head is raised and then dashed against\r\nthe ground until blood issues from the nose and mouth; the eyes may be\r\nbloodshot and sightless; the limbs stiff and outstretched, or they may be\r\nkicked about recklessly; the head may be drawn back and the tail drawn up;\r\nthe urine may be squirted out in spurts; often the \"washer\" (membrane\r\nnictitans) is forced over the eye. When the convulsions cease they may be\r\nfollowed by a period of quiet unconsciousness (coma) which is more or less\r\nprolonged, when the animal may gradually regain consciousness, get up on\r\nits feet, and perhaps quietly partake of food, if there be any within\r\nreach, while at other times it arises with much difficulty and staggers\r\nblindly about the stall or field.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that all the foregoing symptoms are not always seen\r\nin the same case. In those cases usually designated \"sleepy staggers\" the\r\ngeneral symptoms of drowsiness are presented, while in other cases the\r\nsymptoms of frenzy cause the affection to be called \"mad staggers.\" In\r\nother cases there are symptoms of paralysis, swaying of the hind quarters,\r\ninability to rise, etc., and sometimes these symptoms of paralysis are the\r\nmost striking manifestations and continue until death. Acute cases are\r\naccompanied by fever.\r\n\r\nIt is well to remark that when the disease follows injuries to the head the\r\nsymptoms may not be manifested until two or three days (or longer) after\r\nthe accident.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Recoveries are rare in spite of careful attention. To be of\r\nany service whatever the treatment must be prompt and begin with the\r\ndisease. In the early stage, when the pulse is large, most cases will admit\r\nof bleeding. Eight or 9 quarts of blood should be taken from the jugular\r\nvein. This should be followed immediately by a purgative, the following for\r\na cow of average size: Epsom salt, 24 ounces; pulverized gamboge, one-half\r\nounce; croton oil, 20 drops; warm water, 3 quarts; mix all together and\r\ngive at once as a drench. About 2 quarts of warm water or warm soapsuds\r\nshould be injected with a syringe into the rectum every three or four\r\nhours. It is best to keep the animal in a quiet, sheltered place, where it\r\nwill be free from noise or other cause of excitement. All the cold water\r\nthe animal will drink should be allowed, but feed must be withheld, except\r\nbran slops occasionally in small quantities, or grass, if in season, which\r\nmay be cut and carried fresh to the patient.\r\n\r\nThe skull must be examined, and if sign of injury is found, appropriate\r\nsurgical treatment should be given.\r\n\r\nDuring the convulsions all possible efforts should be made to prevent the\r\nanimal injuring itself. The head should be held down on the ground and\r\nstraw kept under it. Cold water may be continuously poured on the head, or\r\nbags filled with ice broken in small pieces may be applied to the head.\r\nDifferent authors recommend different remedies to allay the convulsions,\r\nbut for two reasons it will be found extremely difficult to administer\r\nmedicines during the convulsions: (1) While the animal is unconscious the\r\npower to swallow is lost, and therefore the medicine is more liable to go\r\ndown the windpipe to the lungs than it is to go to the paunch; (2) the\r\nconvulsions are often so violent that it would be utterly useless to\r\nattempt to drench the animal; and furthermore it must be borne in mind that\r\nduring this stage the functions of digestion and absorption are suspended,\r\nand as a consequence the medicine (provided it finds its way to the paunch)\r\nis likely to remain there unabsorbed and therefore useless.\r\n\r\nA blistering compound, composed of mustard, 1 ounce; pulverized\r\ncantharides, one-half ounce; hot water, 4 ounces, well mixed together, may\r\nbe rubbed in over the loins, along the spine, and back of the head on each\r\nside of the neck. This is occasionally attended with beneficial effect, and\r\nespecially so in those cases when paralysis is present.\r\n\r\nIf the purgative acts and the animal shows signs of improvement in the\r\ncourse of two or three days, 2 drams of iodid of potassium may be given\r\nevery night and morning, dissolved in a half bucketful of drinking water,\r\nif the animal will drink it, or it may be dissolved in a half pint of water\r\nand given as a drench. Great care must be observed in regard to the food,\r\nwhich should be nutritive, but not coarse, and at first in small\r\nquantities, gradually increased as the patient improves. After some\r\nprogress is made toward recovery 1-1/2 drams of pulverized nux vomica may\r\nbe given twice a day, added to the iodid of potassium drench. This should\r\nbe administered so long as a staggering gait continues.\r\n\r\nIn those rare cases when recovery takes place it is only partial as a rule,\r\nas there is generally a sequel which remains, such as partial paralysis.\r\nHowever, this is but a slight drawback in cattle, because when it is seen\r\nto persist the medicine should be stopped and the animal fattened for\r\nbutchering.\r\n\r\nPost-mortem examinations discover congestion of the brain and its\r\nmembranes. In those cases which have exhibited much paralysis of the hind\r\nlegs before death the cord may be congested in the lumbar region (loins).\r\nWhen the disease has been caused by injury to the head, the congestion and\r\nextravasated blood may be found inside of the cavity in the location\r\ncorresponding to the place where the injury was inflicted externally. In\r\nsome cases pus is also discovered. It remains to be said that in all\r\nanimals that have died from this affection the lungs are found very much\r\ncongested. This may lead the superficial observer to suppose that the\r\ndisease was a lung affection, but in fact it is only a natural consequence\r\nwhen death ensues from brain disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPOPLEXY.\r\n\r\nThat form of congestion of the brain known as parturient apoplexy, or\r\nparturient paresis, which is so frequently associated with the period of\r\ncalving is described in another part of this work. (See \"Milk fever,\" p.\r\n226.)\r\n\r\nCerebral apoplexy, not connected with parturition, is a rare disease among\r\ncattle. However, it may be due to degeneration and consequent rupture of a\r\nblood vessel in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe attack is sudden, the animal in most cases falling as if it had\r\nreceived a blow on the head. It may stagger and reel some time before going\r\ndown. After falling, there are convulsive movements of the legs or the\r\nanimal sinks into insensibility. There may be remissions in the severity of\r\nthe symptoms, but the pressure from the continued escape of blood soon\r\ncauses death. Rest, quiet, friction to the legs and surface, frequent\r\nturning of the animal and cold to the head are to be practiced, if\r\ntreatment is attempted.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nThere is a form of congestive apoplexy affecting cattle which are in a\r\nplethoric condition. The congestion, or overfilling with blood, causes\r\npressure on the brain substance and disorganizes its function. It occurs\r\nmostly in hot weather. In this disease the symptoms are somewhat similar to\r\nthose exhibited when the animal has encephalitis, but the onset is more\r\nsudden, the duration is shorter, and there is less fever. There may be\r\nfrenzy or coma, or alternations one with the other. The intelligence is\r\ndiminished, staring eyes, bracing with the legs, pressing against the stall\r\npartition or manger, red mucous membranes. This condition usually\r\nterminates in recovery.\r\n\r\nIn such cases bleeding should be resorted to immediately, and when the\r\npower of swallowing is not lost purgatives should be administered. Cold\r\napplications to the head and the general treatment recommended for\r\nencephalitis are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCUSSION OF THE BRAIN.\r\n\r\nSevere blows on the head, striking the head against some hard object while\r\nrunning, or falling on the head may cause concussion of the brain. The\r\ninjury may fracture bones of the cranium and produce compression of the\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms and treatment._--The symptoms and the treatment that is indicated\r\ndiffer very little from what has been said under congestion of the brain\r\nand under encephalitis. In some cases it may be necessary to operate to\r\nremove a piece of bone that is pressing on the brain or to remove a clot of\r\nblood under the area which received the blow.\r\n\r\n\r\nEPILEPSY.\r\n\r\nThis affection is characterized by the occurrence of sudden convulsions.\r\nThe animal may appear to be in a fair state of health usually, but at any\r\ntime, in the stable or in the field, it may have a convulsion in which it\r\nwill fall and lose consciousness. Epilepsy must not be confounded with\r\nvertigo--the fainting which is an effect of heart troubles.\r\n\r\nThe exact cause of epilepsy in the majority of cases is unknown.\r\nPost-mortem examinations in many instances have failed to discover any\r\nlesion in connection with the brain or nervous system, while in other\r\ninstances disease of the brain has been found in the form of thickening\r\nof the membranes, abscesses, and tumors, and in some cases the affection\r\nhas been manifested in connection with a diseased condition of the blood.\r\nThe cause has also been traced to reflex irritation, due to teething,\r\nworms, and chronic indigestion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the affection is due to the last-named causes treatment\r\nmay be successful if the cause is removed. If there are symptoms of worms\r\nor of indigestion, follow the general treatment advised for those troubles\r\nunder their proper heads. If due to irritation caused by teething, the\r\ninflamed gums must be lanced. Examination of the mouth often develops the\r\nfact that one of the temporary teeth causes much irritation by remaining\r\nunshed, and thereby interfering with the growth of a permanent tooth. The\r\noffending tooth should be extracted. When the cause of epilepsy can not be\r\ndiscovered, it must be confessed that there is no prospect of a cure.\r\nHowever, some benefit may be expected from the occasional administration of\r\na purgative dose of medicine. A pound of Epsom salt dissolved in a quart of\r\nwarm water, for a cow of average size, may be given as a drench once or\r\ntwice a month. In addition to the purgative, 4 drams of bromid of\r\npotassium, dissolved in the drinking water, three times a day, has proved\r\nvery beneficial in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSTROKE (PROSTRATION FROM HEAT).\r\n\r\nOwing to the fact that cattle are seldom put to work at which they would\r\nhave to undergo severe exertion, especially in collars, they are not\r\nfrequently prostrated by the extreme heat of the summer months. When at\r\npasture they select the coolest places in the shade of trees, in water,\r\netc., when the heat becomes oppressive, and thereby avoid, as much as\r\npossible, the effects of it.\r\n\r\nIt does happen, however, that cattle that have been kept up for the purpose\r\nof fattening, when driven some distance in very hot weather, are sometimes\r\nprostrated, but it must be remembered that it is not really necessary for\r\nthe animal to be exposed to the rays of the sun, as those confined in hot,\r\nclose places may suffer. This often happens in shipping, when they are\r\ncrowded together in cars.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The premonitory signs are those of exhaustion--dullness,\r\npanting, frothing at the mouth, tongue hanging out, irregular gait,\r\nuneasiness, palpitation--when, if the circumstances which tend to the\r\nprostration are not mitigated, the animal staggers or sways from side to\r\nside, falls, struggles for a while, and then gradually becomes quiet, or\r\nthe struggles may continue, with repeated but ineffectual efforts to regain\r\na standing position. In serious cases the attack may be very sudden,\r\nunconsciousness occurring without continued or distressing premonitory\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--At first, when not very serious, removal to a quiet,\r\nsheltered place, with a few days on a reduced diet, is all that need be\r\ndone. When the animal has fallen, apply cold water or ice to the head; rub\r\nthe body and limbs with cloths or wisps of straw and continue the rubbing\r\nfor a considerable time. If the power of swallowing is not lost (which may\r\nbe ascertained by pouring a little cold water into the mouth), give 3 drams\r\nof stronger liquor ammonia, diluted with a quart of cold water. Be very\r\ncareful in drenching the animal when lying down. Repeat the drench in a\r\nhalf hour and an hour after the first one has been given. Instead of the\r\nammonia, a drench composed of 3 ounces of spirits of nitrous ether in a\r\npint of water may be given, if more convenient, but the ammonia drench is\r\npreferable. If unconsciousness continues, so that a drench can not be\r\nadministered, the same quantity of ammonia and water may be injected with a\r\nsyringe into the rectum. The popular aqua ammonia, commonly called\r\n\"hartshorn,\" will do as well as the stronger liquor ammonia, but as it is\r\nweaker than the latter the dose for a cow is about 1-1/2 ounces, which\r\nshould be diluted with a quart of water before it is given to the animal,\r\neither as a drench or an enema. When ammonia can not be obtained, an ounce\r\nof tincture of digitalis may be given.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the animal is able to rise it should be assisted and moved to\r\nthe nearest shelter. All the cold water it will drink should be allowed.\r\nThe ammonia or spirits of nitrous ether drench should be administered every\r\nthree hours so long as there is much failure of strength. The diet should\r\nbe limited for several days--bran slops and a little grass. When signs of\r\nreturning strength are presented, 12 ounces of Epsom salt dissolved in a\r\nquart of warm water may be given in those cases which have been down and\r\nunconscious, but do not give it while much weakness remains, which may be\r\nfor several days after the attack. The flesh of an animal that is suffering\r\nfrom heat stroke should not be prepared for use as food. On account of the\r\nfever with which the animal suffers, the flesh contains toxins that may\r\nrender it poisonous to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord is liable to concussion from blows and falls, and\r\nparalysis, to a greater or less extent, may be the result. Fracture, with\r\ndisplacement of the bones (vertebrÊ) which form the spinal column, by\r\ncompressing the spinal cord, produces paralysis, which varies in its effect\r\naccording to the part of the cord that is compressed. If the fracture is\r\nabove the middle of the neck, death soon follows, as communication between\r\nthe brain and diaphragm (the essential muscle of inspiration) is stopped.\r\nWhen the fracture is farther down in the neck, posterior to the origin of\r\nthe phrenic nerve, the breathing continues, but there is paralysis in all\r\nparts posterior to the fracture, including the fore and hind legs. When the\r\nfracture is in the region of the loins the hind legs are paralyzed, but the\r\nfore legs are not. If the fracture is in the sacrum (the division of the\r\nspinal column between the loins and the tail), the tail alone is paralyzed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, when the back is broken there is no remedy; the\r\nanimal should be killed at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS.\r\n\r\nParalysis, or loss of motion in a part, may be due to a lesion of the\r\nbrain, of the spinal cord, or of a nerve. It may also be caused by reflex\r\nirritation. When the paralysis affects both sides of the body, posterior to\r\na point, it is further designated by the name paraplegia. When one side of\r\nthe body (a lateral half) is paralyzed, the term hemiplegia is applied to\r\nthe affection. When paralysis is caused by a lesion of a nerve, the\r\nparalysis is confined to the particular part supplied by the affected\r\nnerve.\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out, paralysis may be due to concussion of the spine,\r\nfracture of a bone of the spinal column with consequent compression of the\r\nspinal cord, concussion of the brain, or compression of the brain. An\r\ninjury to one side of the brain may produce paralysis of the same side of\r\nthe head and of the opposite side of the body (hemiplegia). Paralysis may\r\noccur in connection with parturient apoplexy, lead poisoning, ergotism,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE SPINAL CORD.\r\n\r\nParaplegia, or paralysis of the rear part of the body, is the dominant\r\nsymptom in congestion or inflammation of the spinal cord. The cause is not\r\nknown, but the disease is probably due to chilling. It is thought by some\r\nthat some toxic influence (poison) may be responsible for its development.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms usually appear suddenly and consist in inability\r\nto stand. Sometimes this is preceded by a period of excitement. The animal\r\nusually lies quietly, but sometimes it groans and tosses its head about in\r\na way that indicates pain. Cows heavy with calf are sometimes affected with\r\na form of paraplegia, which usually attacks them from about a month to a\r\nfew days before calving. Apparently they are in good health in every\r\nrespect except the inability to stand up on account of the paralysis of the\r\nhind quarters. This form is generally attributed to feeding on feeds\r\ncontaining insufficient protein and ash. It is most likely to occur in cows\r\nthat are weak and thin. With good care and feed recovery usually occurs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal must be given a soft, dry bed under shelter and in\r\na quiet, airy place. It is well to apply mustard along the spine. The\r\naction of the mustard may be intensified by rubbing the skin with ammonia\r\nor turpentine. Internally give a purge of Glauber's salt. Nux vomica or\r\nstrychnia (1 to 2 grain doses) may be given. Turn the cow two to four times\r\ndaily and rub the legs well each time.\r\n\r\nThere are instances when cows will persist in lying down (in spite of all\r\nefforts that are made to compel them to stand up), when it can not really\r\nbe said that they are paralyzed. They have sensation in all parts; they can\r\nmove all their feet; they can change their position; and in fact every\r\nfunction seems to be normally performed, but they obstinately refuse to\r\nrise or even make an effort to do so. Cases of this kind have been killed,\r\nas it was an utter impossibility to get the animal on its feet. However,\r\nthere are instances when a cow, after refusing to rise when all other means\r\nhad been tried, quickly jumped to her feet and showed fright upon the\r\nappearance of a dog or other terrifying object.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES (HYDROPHOBIA).\r\n\r\n[See discussion of this disease in chapter on \"Infectious diseases,\" p.\r\n358.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHTNING STROKE (ASPHYXIA ELECTRICA).\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is struck by lightning the shock is instantaneously expended\r\non the nervous system, and as a rule death occurs immediately; but when the\r\nshock is not fatal animation is suspended to a greater or less extent, as\r\nevidenced by prostration, unconsciousness, and paralysis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--When not fatal, the symptoms vary much, according to the\r\nseverity of the shock. The animal usually falls, as from an apoplectic\r\nattack, and, as a matter of course, the symptoms are such as are generally\r\nmanifested in connection with concussion of the brain. The muscular system\r\nmay be completely relaxed; the legs limber; the muscles flabby and soft to\r\nthe touch; or there may be convulsions, spasms, and twitching of the\r\nmuscles. The breathing is generally labored, irregular, or interrupted, and\r\nslower than normal. In most instances the electrical fluid leaves its mark\r\nby singeing the hair, or by inflicting wounds, burns, or blisters.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--So long as the beating of the heart is perceptible the\r\nendeavor to resuscitate the animal should be continued. Dash cold water\r\nover the head and body; rub the body and legs; smartly whip the body with\r\nwet towels or switches. Mustard, mixed with water, should be well rubbed\r\nover the legs and back of the head on each side of the neck. Inject into\r\nthe rectum 4 drams of stronger liquor ammonia, or 1-1/2 ounces of hartshorn\r\ndiluted with a quart of warm water. Cautiously hold an uncorked bottle of\r\nhartshorn to the nostrils, so that some of it is inhaled, but care should\r\nbe taken that too much is not suddenly inhaled. If the animal is\r\nunconscious, hypodermic injections of stimulants are indicated, such as 6\r\ndrams of camphorated oil in one dose, subcutaneously, or 20 grains of\r\ncaffein or 1/2 grain of strychnin, also subcutaneously.\r\n\r\nWhen the animal revives sufficiently to be able to swallow, 4 drams of the\r\nstronger liquor ammonia, diluted with a quart of cold water, should be\r\ngiven as a drench, and the dose should be repeated in an hour. One and\r\none-half ounces of ordinary hartshorn may be used instead of the stronger\r\nliquor ammonia, but, like the latter, it should be diluted with a quart or\r\nmore of water, and even then care should be exercised in drenching.\r\n\r\nIn cases where the shock has not caused complete insensibility recovery may\r\nbe hastened by the ammonia and water drench, or 4 ounces of brandy diluted\r\nwith a quart of water, or 8 ounces of whisky diluted with a quart of water.\r\nThese doses may be given every three or four hours if necessary. After\r\nrecovery from the more serious symptoms 2 drams of sulphate of quinin\r\nshould be given twice a day until health is restored. If any paralysis\r\nremains 1-1/2 drams of pulverized nux vomica should be given twice a day\r\nwith the quinin.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing treatment is also applicable when the electrical shock is\r\ngiven by telephone, electric car, or electric-light wires, etc. The wounds,\r\nburns, or blisters should be treated according to the antiseptic method of\r\ntreating wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS IN THE BRAIN, ETC.\r\n\r\nTumors of different kinds have been found within the cranial cavity, and in\r\nmany cases there have been no well-marked symptoms exhibited during the\r\nlife of the animal to lead one to suspect their existence. Cases are\r\nrecorded where bony tumors have been found in the brain of cattle that died\r\nsuddenly, but during life no signs of disease were manifested. Post-mortem\r\nexaminations have disclosed tubercles in the membranes of the brain. (See\r\n\"Tuberculosis,\" p. 407.) Abscesses, usually the result of inflammation of\r\nthe brain, have been found post-mortem. For the description of\r\nhydrocephalus, or dropsy of the brain, of calves the reader is referred to\r\nthe section on parturition. (See \"Water in the head,\" p. 179.)\r\n\r\nChorea, constant twitching and irregular spasmodic movements of the\r\nmuscles, has been noticed in connection with or as a sequel to other\r\naffections, as, for example, parturient apoplexy.\r\n\r\nVarious diseases, the description of which will be found in other sections\r\nof this work, affect the nervous system to a greater or less extent--for\r\nexample, ergotism, lead poisoning, uremia, parturient apoplexy, colic, and\r\nother affections associated with cramps, or spasms, etc. Disease of the\r\novaries or of the spinal cord, by reflex irritation, may cause estromania\r\n(see \"Excess of venereal desire,\" p. 148, constant desire for the bull).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nBy JAMES LAW, F. R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the materials that have served their purpose in building up the animal\r\nbody or in sustaining the body temperature, and that are now to be thrown\r\nout as waste, the greater part is expelled from the system through the\r\nlungs and the kidneys, but the agents that pass out by either of these two\r\nchannels differ in the main from those passing by the other. Thus from the\r\nlungs in the form of dioxid of carbon--the same gas that comes from burning\r\nof coal or oil--there escapes most of the waste material resulting from the\r\ndestruction in the system of fats, sugars, starch, and such other foods as\r\nare wanting in the element nitrogen, and do not form fibrous tissues, but\r\ngo mainly to support animal heat or maintain functional activity. From the\r\nkidneys, on the other hand, are thrown out the waste products resulting\r\nfrom the destruction of the foods and tissues containing nitrogen--of, for\r\ninstance, albumin, fibrin, gluten, casein, gelatin, woody tissue, etc.\r\nWhile much of the waste material containing nitrogen leaves the body by the\r\nbowels, this is virtually only such of the albuminoid food as has failed to\r\nbe fully digested and absorbed; this has never formed a true constituent\r\npart of the body itself or of the blood, but is so much waste food, like\r\nthat which has come to the table and again carried away unused. If the\r\nalbuminoid food element has entered the blood, whether or not it has been\r\nbuilt up into a constituent part of the structure of the body, its waste\r\nproducts, which contain nitrogen, are in the main expelled through the\r\nkidneys, so that the latter become the principal channels for the expulsion\r\nof all nitrogen-containing waste.\r\n\r\nIt would be an error, however, to infer that all nitrogenous food, when\r\nonce digested and absorbed into the blood, must necessarily leave the\r\nsystem in the urine. On the contrary, in the young and growing animal, all\r\nincrease of the fibrous structures of the body is gained through the\r\nbuilding up of those flesh-forming constituents into their substance; in\r\nthe pregnant animal the growth of the offspring and its envelopes has a\r\nsimilar origin, and in the dairy cow the casein or curd of the milk is a\r\nmeans of constant elimination of these nitrogen-containing agents. Thus, in\r\nthe breeding cow and, above all, in the milking cow, the womb or udder\r\ncarries on a work in one sense equivalent to that otherwise performed by\r\nthe kidneys. Not only are these organs alike channels for the excretion of\r\nalbuminous products, but they are also related to each other structurally\r\nand by nervous sympathy, so that suffering in the one is liable to induce\r\nsome measure of disorder in the other.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of other mammals, this nitrogenous waste matter is mainly\r\npresent in the urine of cattle in the form of urea, but also, to some\r\nextent, as hippuric acid, a derivative of vegetable food which, in the\r\nherbivora, replaces the uric acid found in the urine of man and carnivora.\r\nUric acid is, however, found in the urine of sucking calves which have\r\npractically an animal diet, and it may also appear in the adult in case of\r\nabsolute, prolonged starvation, and in diseases attended with complete loss\r\nof appetite and rapid wasting of the body. In such cases the animal lives\r\non its own substance, and the product is that of the wasting flesh.\r\n\r\nThe other products containing nitrogen are present in only small quantities\r\nand need not be specially referred to. The urine of cattle contains much\r\nless of carbonates than that of the horse, and effervesces less on the\r\naddition of an acid. As the carbonates form a large proportion of the solid\r\ndeposits (gravel, stone) from the horse's urine, the ox may thus be held\r\nless liable, yet even in the ox the carbonates become abundant or scanty,\r\naccording to the nature of the feed, and therefore gravel, formed by\r\ncarbonate of lime, is not infrequent in cattle. When fed on beets, clover\r\nhay, or bean straw carbonates are present in large quantities, these\r\naliments being rich in organic acids and alkaline carbonates; whereas upon\r\noat straw, barley straw, and, above all, wheat straw, they are in small\r\namount. In calves fed on milk alone no carbonates are found in the urine.\r\n\r\nPhosphates, usually in combination with lime, are, as a rule, present only\r\nin traces in the urine of cattle; however, on a dietary of wheat, bran, or\r\nother aliment rich in phosphates, these may be present in large amount, so\r\nthat they render the liquid cloudy or are deposited in solid crystals. The\r\nliquid is rendered transparent by nitric acid.\r\n\r\nThe cow's urine, on a diet of hay and potatoes, contained:\r\n\r\n                                       Parts.\r\n  Urea                                  18.5\r\n  Potassic hippurate                    16.5\r\n  Alkaline lactates                     17.2\r\n  Potassium bicarbonate                 16.1\r\n  Magnesium carbonate                    4.7\r\n  Lime carbonate                         0.6\r\n  Potassium sulphate                     3.6\r\n  Common salt                            1.5\r\n  Silica                               Trace\r\n  Phosphates                             0.0\r\n  Water and undetermined substances    921.3\r\n                                     _______\r\n  Total                              1,000.0\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table after Tereg[1] gives the different conditions of the\r\nurine, and especially the amount of urea and hippuric acid under different\r\nrations.

--------------+------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\r\n\r\nThe varying quantity of urea (from 1.6 to 15.4 ounces) is most suggestive\r\nas to the action of the more or less nitrogenous feed and the resulting\r\nconcentration of the urine and blood. Hippuric acid, on the other hand, is\r\nmost abundant when the animal is fed on hay and straw.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of the urine of cattle varies from 1,030 to 1,060 in\r\nhealth, water being 1,000. It is transparent, with a yellowish tinge, and\r\nhas a characteristic, musky smell. The chemical reaction is alkaline,\r\nturning red litmus paper blue. The quantity passed in twenty-four hours\r\nvaries greatly, increasing not only with the water drunk, but with the\r\nalbuminoids taken in with the feed and the urea produced. If a solution of\r\nurea is injected into the veins the secretion of urine is greatly\r\naugmented. Similarly the excess of salts like carbonate of potash in the\r\nfeed, or of sugar, increases the action of the kidneys. Only about 20 per\r\ncent of the water swallowed escapes in the urine, the remaining 80 per cent\r\npassing mostly from the lungs, and to a slight extent by the bowels. The\r\nskin of the ox does not perspire so readily nor so freely as that of the\r\nhorse; hence the kidneys and lungs are called upon for extra work. The\r\ninfluence of an excess of water in the feed is most remarkable in swill-fed\r\ndistillery cattle, which urinate profusely and frequently, yet thrive and\r\nfatten rapidly.\r\n\r\nAmong the other conditions that increase the flow of urine is overfilling\r\nof (internal pressure in) the blood vessels of the kidneys; hence the\r\ncontraction of the blood vessels of the skin by cold drives the blood\r\ninward, tends to dilate the blood vessels of the kidneys, and to increase\r\nthe secretion of urine. Nervous disorders, such as excitement, fear,\r\ncongestions, or structural injuries to the back part of the base of the\r\nbrain, have a similar result, hence, doubtless, the action of certain fungi\r\ngrowing in musty hay or oats in producing profuse flow of urine, whereas\r\nother forms of musty fodder cause stupor, delirium, or paralysis. Bacteria\r\nand their products are mainly expelled by the kidneys, and become sources\r\nof local infection, irritation, and disease.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of urine passed daily by an ox on dry feeding averages 7 to 12\r\npints, but this may be increased enormously on a watery diet.\r\n\r\nThe mutual influence of the kidneys and other important organs tends to\r\nexplain the way in which disease in one part supervenes on preexisting\r\ndisorder in another. The introduction of albuminoids in excess into the\r\nblood means the formation of an excess of urea, and a more profuse\r\nsecretion of urine, of a higher specific gravity, and with a greater\r\ntendency to deposit its solid constituents, as gravel, in the kidneys or\r\nbladder. A torpid action of the liver, leaving the albuminoids in\r\ntransition forms, less soluble than the urea into which they should have\r\nbeen changed, favors the onset of rheumatism or of nervous disorder, the\r\ndeposit of such albuminoid products in the kidneys, the formation of a\r\ndeep-brown or reddish urine, and congestion of the kidneys. Any abnormal\r\nactivity of the liver in the production of sugar--more than can be burned\r\nup in the circulation--overstimulates the kidneys and produces increased\r\nflow of a heavy urine with a sweetish taste. This increased production of\r\nsugar may be primarily due to disease of the brain, which, in its turn,\r\ndetermines the disorder of the liver. Disease of the right side of the\r\nheart or of the lungs, by obstructing the onward flow of blood from the\r\nveins, increases the blood pressure in the kidneys and produces disorder\r\nand excessive secretion. Inactivity of the kidneys determines an increase\r\nin the blood of waste products, which become irritating to different parts,\r\nproducing skin eruptions, itching, dropsies, and nervous disorders. Sprains\r\nof the loins produce bleeding from the kidneys and disease of the spinal\r\ncord, and sometimes determine albuminous or milky looking urine.\r\n\r\nThe kidney of the ox (Pl. IX, fig. 1) is a compound organ made up of 15 to\r\n25 separate lobules like so many separate kidneys, but all pouring their\r\nsecretion into one common pouch (pelvis) situated in an excavation in the\r\ncenter of the lower surface. While the ox is the only domesticated\r\nquadruped which maintains this divided condition of the kidney after birth,\r\nthis condition is common to all while at an early stage of development in\r\nthe womb. The cluster of lobules making up a single kidney forms an ovoid\r\nmass flattened from above downward, and extending from the last rib\r\nbackward beneath the loins and to one side of the solid chain of the\r\nbackbone. The right is more firmly attached to the loins and extends\r\nfarther backward than the left. Deeply covered in a mass of suet, each\r\nkidney has a strong outer, white, fibrous covering, and inside this two\r\nsuccessive layers of kidney substance, of which the outer is that in which\r\nthe urine is mainly separated from the blood and poured into the fine,\r\nmicroscopic urinary ducts. (Pl. X, fig. 1) These latter, together with\r\nblood vessels, lymph vessels, and nerves, make up the second, or internal,\r\nlayer. The outer layer is mainly composed of minute globular clusters of\r\nmicroscopic, intercommunicating blood vessels (Malpighian bodies), each of\r\nwhich is furnished with a fibrous capsule that is nothing else than the\r\ndilated commencement of a urine tube. These practically microscopic tubes\r\nfollow at first a winding course through the outer layer (Ferrein's tubes),\r\nthen form a long loop (doubling on itself) in the inner layer (Henle's\r\nloop), and finally pass back through the inner layer (Bellini's tubes) to\r\nopen through a conical process into the common pouch (pelvis) on the lower\r\nsurface of the organ. (Pl. X, figs. 1, 2, 3.)\r\n\r\nThe tube that conveys the urine from the kidney to the bladder is like a\r\nwhite, round cord, about the size of a goose quill, prolonged from the\r\npouch on the lower surface of the kidney backward beneath the loins, then\r\ninward, supported by a fold of thin membrane, to open into the bladder just\r\nin front of its neck. The canal passes first through the middle (muscular)\r\ncoat of the bladder, and then advances perceptibly between that and the\r\ninternal (mucous) coat, through which it finally opens. By this arrangement\r\nin overfilling the bladder this opening is closed like a valve by the\r\npressure of the urine, and the return of liquid to the kidney is prevented.\r\nThe bladder (Pl. IX, fig. 2) is a dilatable, egg-shaped pouch, closed\r\nbehind by a strong ring of muscular fibers encircling its neck, and\r\nenveloped by looped, muscular fibers extending on all sides around its body\r\nand closed anterior end. Stimulated by the presence of urine, these last\r\ncontract and expel contents through the neck into the urethra. This last is\r\nthe tube leading backward along the floor of the pelvic bones and downward\r\nthrough the penis. In the bull this canal of the urethra is remarkable for\r\nits small caliber and for the S-shaped bend which it describes in the space\r\nbetween the thighs and just above the scrotum. This bend is attributable to\r\nthe fact that the retractor muscles are attached to the penis at this\r\npoint, and in withdrawing that organ within its sheath they double it upon\r\nitself. The small size of the canal and this S-shaped bend are serious\r\nobstacles to the passing of a catheter to draw the urine, yet by extending\r\nthe penis out of its sheath the bend is effaced, and a small, gum-elastic\r\ncatheter, not more than one-fourth of an inch in diameter, may with care be\r\npassed into the bladder. In the cow the urethra is very short, opening in\r\nthe median line on the floor of the vulva about 4 inches in front of its\r\nexternal orifice. Even in her, however, the passing of a catheter is a\r\nmatter of no little difficulty, the opening of the urethra being very\r\nnarrow and encircled by the projecting membranous and rigid margins, and on\r\neach side of the opening is a blind pouch (canal of G‰rtner) into which the\r\ncatheter will almost invariably find its way. In both male and female,\r\ntherefore, the passing of a catheter is an operation which demands special\r\nskill.\r\n\r\n_General symptoms of urinary disorders._--These are not so prominent in\r\ncattle as in horses, yet they are of a similar kind. There is a stiff or\r\nstraddling gait with the hind legs and some difficulty in turning or in\r\nlying down and rising, the act causing a groan. The frequent passage of\r\nurine in driblets, its continuous escape in drops, the sudden arrest of the\r\nflow when in full stream, the rhythmic contraction of the muscles under the\r\nanus without any flow resulting, the swelling of the sheath, the collection\r\nof hard, gritty masses on the hair surrounding the orifice of the sheath,\r\nthe occurrence of dropsies in the limbs under the chest or belly, or in\r\neither of these cavities, and finally the appearance of nervous stupor, may\r\nindicate serious disorder of the urinary organs. The condition of the urine\r\npassed may likewise lead to suspicion. It may be white, from crystallized\r\ncarbonate of lime; brown, red, or even black, from the presence of blood or\r\nblood-coloring matter; yellow, from biliary coloring matter; frothy, from\r\ncontained albumin; cloudy, from phosphates; glairy, from pus; it may also\r\nshow gritty masses from gravel. In many cases of urinary disorder in the\r\nox, however, the symptoms are by no means prominent, and unless special\r\nexamination is made of the loins, the bladder, and the urine the true\r\nnature of the malady may be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIURESIS (POLYURIA, DIABETES INSIPIDUS, EXCESSIVE SECRETION OF URINE).\r\n\r\nA secretion of urine in excess of the normal amount may be looked on as\r\ndisease, even if the result does not lead to immediate loss of condition.\r\nCattle fed on distillery swill are striking examples of such excess caused\r\nby the enormous consumption of a liquid feed, which nourishes and fattens\r\nin spite of the diuresis; the condition is unwholesome, and cattle that\r\nhave passed four or five months in a swill stable have fatty livers and\r\nkidneys, and never again do well on ordinary feed. Diuresis may further\r\noccur from increase of blood pressure in the kidneys (diseases of the heart\r\nor lungs which hinder the onward passage of the blood, the eating of\r\ndigitalis, English broom, the contraction of the blood vessels on the\r\nsurface of the body in cold weather, etc.); also from acrid or diuretic\r\nplants taken with the feed (dandelion, burdock, colchicum, digitalis,\r\nsavin, resinous shoots, etc.); from excess of sugar in the feed (beets,\r\nturnips, ripe sorghum); also from the use of frozen feed (frosted turnip\r\ntops and other vegetables), and from the growths of certain molds in fodder\r\n(musty hay, mow-burnt hay, moldy oats, moldy bread, etc.). Finally,\r\nalkaline waters and alkaline incrustations on the soil may be active\r\ncauses. In some of these cases the result is beneficial rather than\r\ninjurious, as when cattle affected with gravel in the kidneys are entirely\r\nfreed from this condition by a run at grass, or by an exclusive diet of\r\nroots or swill. In other cases, however, the health and condition suffer,\r\nand even inflammation of the kidneys may occur.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment is mainly in the change of diet to a more solid\r\naliment destitute of the special, offensive ingredient. Boiled flaxseed is\r\noften the best diet or addition to the wholesome dry food, and, by way of\r\nmedicine, doses of 2 drams each of sulphate of iron and iodid of potassium\r\nmay be given twice daily. In obstinate cases 2 drams ergot of rye or of\r\ncatechu may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOODY URINE (RED WATER, MOOR ILL, WOOD ILL, HEMATURIA, HEMAGLOBINURIA).\r\n\r\nThis is a common affection among cattle in certain localities, above all on\r\ndamp, undrained lands and under a backward agriculture. It is simply bloody\r\nurine or hematuria when the blood is found in clots, or when under the\r\nmicroscope the blood globules can be detected as distinctly rounded,\r\nflattened disks. It is smoky urine--hemaglobinuria--when neither such\r\ndistinct clots nor blood disks can be found, but merely a general browning,\r\nreddening, or blackening of the urine by the presence of dissolved,\r\nblood-coloring matter. The bloody urine is the more direct result of\r\nstructural disease of the kidneys or urinary passages (inflammation, stone,\r\ngravel, tumors, hydatids, kidney worms, sprains of the loins), while the\r\nstained urine (hemaglobinuria) is usually the result of some general or\r\nmore distinct disorder in which the globules are destroyed in the\r\ncirculating blood and the coloring matter dissolved in and diffused through\r\nthe whole mass of the blood and of the urine secreted from it. As in the\r\ntwo forms, blood and the elements of blood escape into the urine, albumin\r\nis always present, so that there is albuminuria with blood-coloring matter\r\nsuperadded. If from stone or gravel, gritty particles are usually passed,\r\nand may be detected in the bottom of a dish in which the liquid is caught.\r\nIf from fracture or severe sprain of the loins, it is liable to be\r\nassociated not only with some loss of control of the hind limbs and with\r\nstaggering behind but also with a more or less perfect paralysis of the\r\ntail. The bloodstained urine without red globules results from specific\r\ndiseases--Texas fever (Pl. XLVII, fig. 3), anthrax, spirillosis, and from\r\neating irritant plants (broom, savin, mercury, hellebore, ranunculus,\r\nconvolvulus, colchicum, oak shoots, ash privet, hazel, hornbeam, and other\r\nastringent, acrid, or resinous plants, etc.). The Maybug or Spanish fly\r\ntaken with the feed or spread over a great extent of skin as a blister has\r\na similar action. Frosted turnips or other roots will bring on the\r\naffection in some subjects. Among conditions which act by the direct\r\ndestruction of the globules in the circulating blood may be named an excess\r\nof water in that fluid; the use of water from soils rich in decomposing\r\nvegetable matter and containing alkaline salts, particularly nitrites; and\r\nthe presence in the water and feed of the ptomaines of bacteria growth;\r\nhence the prevalence of \"red water\" in marshy districts and on clayey and\r\nother impervious soils, and the occurrence of bloody urine in the advanced\r\nstages of several contagious diseases. Some mineral poisons--such as iodin,\r\narsenic, and phosphorus taken to excess--may cause hematuria, and finally\r\nthe symptoms may be merely the result of a constitutional predisposition of\r\nthe individual or family to bleeding. In some predisposed subjects,\r\nexposure of the body to cold or wet will cause the affection.\r\n\r\nThe specific symptom of bloody or smoky water is a very patent one. It may\r\nor may not be associated with fever, with the presence or absence of\r\nabdominal tenderness on pressure, with a very frothy state of the milk or\r\neven a reddish tinge, with or without marked paleness of the mucous\r\nmembranes, and general weakness. When direct injury to the kidneys is the\r\nimmediate cause of the disease the urine will be passed often, in small\r\nquantity at a time, and with much straining. When there is bloodlessness (a\r\nwatery blood) from insufficient nourishment, fever is absent and the red\r\nwater is at first the only symptom. When the active cause has been irritant\r\nplants, abdominal tenderness, colics, and other signs of bowel inflammation\r\nare marked features.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment varies according as the cause has been a direct\r\nirritant operating on a subject in vigorous health or a microbian poison\r\nacting on an animal deficient in blood and vigor. In the first form of red\r\nwater a smart purgative (1 pound to 1-1/2 pounds Glauber's salt) will clear\r\naway the irritants from the bowels and allay the coexistent high fever. It\r\nwill also serve to divert to the bowels much of the irritant products\r\nalready absorbed into the blood and will thus protect the kidneys. In many\r\nsuch cases a liberal supply of wholesome, easily digestible feed will be\r\nall the additional treatment required. In this connection demulcent feed\r\n(boiled flaxseed, wheat bran) is especially good. If much blood has been\r\nlost, bitters (gentian, one-half ounce) and iron (sulphate of iron, 2\r\ndrams) should be given for a week.\r\n\r\nFor cases in which excess of diuretic plants has been taken, it may be well\r\nto replace the salts by 1 to 2 pints of olive oil, adding 1 ounce of\r\nlaudanum and 2 drams of gum camphor; also to apply fomentations or a fresh\r\nsheepskin over the loins. Buttermilk or vinegar, one-half pint, or\r\nsulphuric acid, 60 drops in a pint of water, may also be used frequently as\r\ninjections. In cases caused by sprained or fractured loins, inflamed\r\nkidneys, stone or gravel, the treatment will be as for the particular\r\ndisease in question.\r\n\r\nIn hematuria from anemia (watery blood), whether from insufficient or badly\r\nadjusted rations or from the poisonous products of fermentations in\r\nimpervious or marshy soils, the treatment must be essentially tonic and\r\nstimulating. Rich, abundant, and easily digestible feed must be furnished.\r\nThe different grains (oats, barley, wheat, bran, rye) and seeds (rape,\r\nlinseed, cotton seed) are especially called for and may be given either\r\nground or boiled. As a bitter, sulphate of quinin, one-half dram, and\r\ntincture of chlorid of iron, 2 drams, may be given in a pint of water\r\nthrice a day. In some cases 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls of oil of turpentine twice\r\ndaily in milk will act favorably.\r\n\r\nIn this anemic variety prevention is the great need. The drainage and\r\ncultivation of the dangerous soils is the main object. Until this can be\r\naccomplished young and newly purchased cattle not yet inured to the poisons\r\nmust be kept from the dangerous fields and turned on only those which are\r\nalready drained naturally or artificially. Further, they should have an\r\nabundant ration in which the local product of grass, hay, etc., is\r\nsupplemented by grain or other seeds. Another point to be guarded against\r\nis the supply of water that has drained from marshes or impervious soils,\r\nrich in organic matter, as such water is charged with nitrites, ptomaines,\r\netc., which directly conduce to the disorder. Fence out from all such\r\nwaters and supply from living springs or deep wells only.\r\n\r\n\r\nALBUMIN IN THE URINE (ALBUMINURIA).\r\n\r\nIn bloody urine albumin is always present as an important constituent of\r\nthe blood, and in congested and inflamed kidneys it is present as a part of\r\nthe inflammatory exudate. Apart from these, albumin in the urine represents\r\nin different cases a variety of diseased conditions of the kidneys or of\r\ndistant organs. Among the additional causes of albuminuria may be named:\r\n(1) An excess of albumin in the blood (after easy calving with little loss\r\nof blood and before the secretion of milk has been established, or in cases\r\nof sudden suppression of the secretion of milk); (2) under increase of\r\nblood pressure (after deep drinking, after doses of digitalis or broom,\r\nafter transfusion of blood from one animal to another, or in disease of the\r\nheart or lungs causing obstruction to the flow of blood from the veins);\r\n(3) after cutting (or disease) of the motor nerves of the vessels going to\r\nthe kidneys, causing congestion of these organs; (4) violent exertion,\r\nhence long drives; the same happens with violent, muscular spasms, as from\r\nstrychnia poisoning, lockjaw, epilepsy, and convulsions; (5) in most fevers\r\nand extensive inflammations of important organs, like the lungs or liver,\r\nthe escape of the albumin being variously attributed to the high\r\ntemperature of the body and disorder of the nerves, and to resulting\r\ncongestion and disorder of the secreting cells of the kidneys; (6) in burns\r\nand some other congested states of the skin; (7) under the action of\r\ncertain poisons (strong acids, phosphorous, arsenic, Spanish flies,\r\ncarbolic acid, and those inducing bloody urine); (8) in certain conditions\r\nof weakness or congestion of the secreting cells of the kidneys, so that\r\nthey allow this element of the blood to escape; (9) when the feed is\r\nentirely wanting in common salt, albumin may appear in the urine\r\ntemporarily after a full meal containing an excess of albumin. It can also\r\nbe produced experimentally by puncturing the back part of the base of the\r\nbrain (the floor of the fourth ventricle close to the point the injury to\r\nwhich causes sugary urine). In abscess, tumor, or inflammation of the\r\nbladder, ureter, or urethra the urine is albuminous.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that albumin in the urine does not indicate the\r\nexistence of any one specific disease, and except when from weakness or\r\nloss of function of the kidney cells, it must be looked on as an attendant\r\non another disease, the true nature of which we must try to find out. These\r\naffections we must exclude one by one until we are left to assume the\r\nnoninflammatory disorder of the secreting cells of the kidney. It is\r\nespecially important to exclude inflammation of the kidney, and to do this\r\nmay require a microscopic examination of the sediment of the urine and the\r\ndemonstration of the entire absence of casts of the uriniferous tubes. (See\r\n\"Nephritis,\" p. 123.)\r\n\r\nTo detect albumin in the urine, the suspected and frothy liquid must be\r\nrendered sour by adding a few drops of nitric acid and then boiled in a\r\ntest tube. If a solid precipitate forms, then a few more drops of nitric\r\nacid should be added, and if the liquid does not clear it up it is albumin.\r\nA precipitate thrown down by boiling and redissolved by nitric acid is\r\nprobably phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is usually directed to the disease on which it is\r\ndependent. In the absence of any other recognizable disease, mucilaginous\r\ndrinks of boiled flaxseed, slippery elm, or gum may be given, tannic acid,\r\none-half dram twice daily, and fomentations or even mustard poultices over\r\nthe loins. When the disease is chronic and there is no attendant fever\r\n(elevation of temperature), tonics (hydrochloric acid, 6 drops in a pint of\r\nwater; phosphate of iron, 2 drams, or sulphate of quinin, 2 drams, repeated\r\ntwice daily) may be used. In all cases the patient should be kept carefully\r\nfrom cold and wet, a warm, dry shed, or in warm weather a dry, sunny yard\r\nor pasture being especially desirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGAR IN URINE (DIABETES MELLITUS).\r\n\r\nThis is a frequent condition of the urine in parturition fever, but as a\r\nspecific disease, associated with deranged liver or brain, it is\r\npractically unknown in cattle. As a mere attendant on another disease it\r\ndemands no special notice here.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE KIDNEYS (NEPHRITIS).\r\n\r\nThis has been divided according as it affects the different parts of the\r\nkidneys, as: (1) Its fibrous covering (perinephritis); (2) the secreting\r\ntissue of its outer portion (parenchymatous); (3) the connective tissue\r\n(interstitial); (4) the lining membrane of its ducts (catarrhal); and (5)\r\nits pelvis or sac receiving the urine (pyelitis). It has also been\r\ndistinguished according to the changes that take place in the kidney,\r\nespecially as seen after death, according to the quantity of albumin in the\r\nurine, and according as the affection is acute or chronic. For the purpose\r\nof this work it will be convenient to consider these as one inflammatory\r\ndisease, making a distinction merely between the acute and the chronic or\r\nof long standing.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ are in the main like those causing bloody urine, such as\r\nirritant and diuretic plants, Spanish flies applied as a blister or\r\notherwise, exposure to cold and wet, the presence of stone or gravel in the\r\nkidneys, injuries to the back or loins, as by riding one another, the\r\ndrinking of alkaline or selenitic water, the use of putrid, stagnant water,\r\nof that containing bacteria and their products, the consumption of musty\r\nfodder, etc. (See \"Hematuria,\" p. 119.)\r\n\r\nThe length of the loins in cattle predisposes these parts to mechanical\r\ninjury, and in the lean and especially in the thin, working ox the kidney\r\nis very liable to suffer. In the absence of an abundance of loose,\r\nconnective tissue and of fat, the kidneys lie in close contact with the\r\nmuscles of the loins, and any injury to them may tend to stretch the kidney\r\nand its vessels, or to cause its inflammation by direct extension of the\r\ndisease from the injured muscle to the adjacent kidney. Thus, under\r\nunusually heavy draft, under slips or falls on slippery ground, under\r\nsudden unexpected drooping or twisting of the loins from missteps or from\r\nthe feet sinking into holes, under the loading and jarring of the loins\r\nwhen animals ride one another in cases of \"heat,\" the kidneys are subject\r\nto injury and inflammation. A hard run, as when chased by a dog, may be the\r\noccasion of such an attack. A fodder rich in nitrogenous or flesh-forming\r\nelements (beans, peas, vetches (_Vicia sativa_), and other leguminous\r\nplants) has been charged with irritating the kidneys through the excess of\r\nurea, hippuric acid, and allied products eliminated through these organs\r\nand the tendency to the formation of gravel. It seems, however, that these\r\nfeeds are most dangerous when partially ripened and yet not fully matured,\r\na stage of growth at which they are liable to contain ingredients\r\nirritating to the stomach and poisonous to the brain, as seen in their\r\ninducing so-called \"stomach staggers.\" Even in the poisoning by the seeds\r\nof ripened but only partially cured rye grass (_Lolium perenne_), and\r\ndarnel (_Lolium temulentum_), the kidneys are found violently congested\r\nwith black blood; also, in the indigestions that result from the eating of\r\npartially ripened corn or millet some congestion of the kidneys is an\r\nattendant phenomenon.\r\n\r\nCruzel says that the disease as occurring locally is usually not alone from\r\nthe acrid and resinous plants charged with inducing hematuria, but also\r\nfrom stinking camomile (_Anthemis cotula_) and field poppy when used in the\r\nfresh, succulent condition; also from the great prevalence of dead\r\ncaterpillars on the pasture, or from dead Spanish flies in the stagnant\r\npools of water. The fresh plants are believed to be injurious only by\r\nreason of a volatile oil which is dissipated in drying. In the case of the\r\nstagnant water it may be questioned whether the chemical products of the\r\ncontained ferments (bacteria) are not more frequently the cause of the evil\r\nthan the alleged Spanish flies, though the latter are hurtful enough when\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the kidneys may further be a form or an extension of a\r\nspecific contagious disease, such as erysipelas, rinderpest, septicemia, or\r\neven of poisoning by the spores of fungi. Rivolta reports the case of a cow\r\nwith spots of local congestion and blood staining in the kidney, the\r\naffected parts being loaded with bacteria. Unfortunately he neither\r\ncultivated the bacteria nor inoculated them, and thus the case stands\r\nwithout positive demonstration that they were the cause of disease.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the _symptoms_ of nephritis are very manifest, and in\r\nothers so hidden that the existence of the affection can be certainly\r\nrecognized only by a microscopic examination of the urine. In violent cases\r\nthere is high fever, increase of the body temperature to 103∞ F. and\r\nupward; hurried breathing, with a catching inspiration; accelerated pulse;\r\ndry, hot muzzle; burning of the roots of the horns and ears; loss of\r\nappetite; suspended rumination; and indications of extreme sensitiveness in\r\nthe loins. The patient stands with back arched and hind legs extended\r\nbackward and outward, and passes water frequently, in driblets, of a high\r\ncolor and specific gravity, containing albumin and microscopic casts. (Pl.\r\nXI, fig. 5.) When made to move, the patient does so with hesitation and\r\ngroaning, especially if turned in a narrow circle; when pinched on the\r\nflank just beneath the lateral bony processes of the loins, especially on\r\nthat side on which the disease predominates, it flinches and groans. If the\r\nexamination is made with oiled hand introduced through the last gut\r\n(rectum), the pressure upward on the kidneys gives rise to great pain and\r\nto efforts to escape by moving away and by active contractions of the\r\nrectum for the expulsion of the hand. Sometimes there is a distinct\r\nswelling over the loins or quarter on one or both sides. In uncastrated\r\nmales the testicle on the affected side is drawn up, or is alternately\r\nraised and dropped. In all there is a liability to tremors of the thigh on\r\nthe side affected.\r\n\r\nIn some severe cases colicky pains are as violent as in the worst forms of\r\nindigestion and spasms of the bowels. The animal frequently shifts from one\r\nhind foot to the other, stamps, kicks at the belly, frequently looks\r\nanxiously at its flank, moans plaintively, lies down and quickly gets up\r\nagain, grinds its teeth, twists its tail, and keeps the back habitually\r\narched and rigid and the hind feet advanced under the belly. The bowels may\r\nbe costive and the feces glistening with a coat of mucus, or they may be\r\nloose and irritable, and the paunch or even the bowels may become distended\r\nwith gas (bloating) as the result of indigestion and fermentation. In some\r\nanimals, male and female alike, the rigid, arched condition of the back\r\nwill give way to such undulating movements as are sometimes seen in the act\r\nof coition.\r\n\r\nThe disease does not always appear in its full severity; for a day, or even\r\ntwo, however, there may be merely loss of appetite, impaired rumination, a\r\ndisposition to remain lying down, yet when the patient is raised it\r\nmanifests suffering by anxiously looking at the flanks, shifting or\r\nstamping of the hind feet, shaking of the tail, and attempts to urinate,\r\nwhich are either fruitless or lead to the discharge of a small quantity of\r\nhigh-colored or perhaps bloody urine.\r\n\r\nIn some recent slight cases, and in many chronic ones, these symptoms may\r\nbe absent or unobserved, and an examination of the urine is necessary to\r\nreach a safe conclusion. The urine may contain blood, or it may be cloudy\r\nfrom contained albumin, which coagulates on heating with nitric acid (see\r\n\"Albuminuria,\" p. 121); it may be slightly glairy from pus, or gritty\r\nparticles may be detected in it. In seeking for casts of the uriniferous\r\ntubes, a drop may be taken with a fine tube from the bottom of the liquid\r\nafter standing, and examined under a power magnifying 50 diameters. If the\r\nfine, cylindroid filaments are seen they may then be examined with a power\r\nof 200 or 250 diameters. (Pl. XI, fig. 5.) The appearance of the casts\r\ngives some clue to the condition of the kidneys. If made up of large,\r\nrounded or slightly columnar cells, with a single nucleus in each cell\r\n(epithelial), they imply comparatively slight and recent disease of the\r\nkidney tubes, the detachment of the epithelium being like what is seen in\r\nany inflamed mucous surface. If made up largely of the small, disk-shaped\r\nand nonnucleated red blood globules, they imply escape of blood, and\r\nusually a recent injury or congestion of the kidney--it may be from\r\nsprains, blows, or the ingestion of acrid or diuretic poisons. If the casts\r\nare made of a clear, waxy, homogeneous substance (hyaline), without any\r\nadmixture of opaque particles, they imply an inflammation of longer\r\nstanding, in which the inflamed kidney tubules have been already stripped\r\nof their cellular (epithelial) lining. If the casts are rendered opaque by\r\nthe presence of minute, spherical granular cells, like white blood\r\nglobules, it betokens active suppuration of the kidney tubes. In other\r\ncases the casts are rendered opaque by entangled earthy granules (carbonate\r\nof lime), or crystals of some other urinary salts. In still other cases the\r\ncasts entangle clear, refrangent globules of oil or fat, which may imply\r\nfatty degeneration of the kidneys or injury to the spinal cord. The\r\npresence of free pus giving a glairy, flocculent appearance to the urine is\r\nsuggestive of inflammation of the urinary pouch at the commencement of the\r\nexcretory duct (pelvis of kidney) (Pl. IX, fig. 1), especially if\r\ncomplicated with gritty particles of earthy salts. This condition is known\r\nas pyelitis. In the chronic cases swelling of the legs or along the lower\r\nsurface of chest or abdomen, or within these respective cavities, is a\r\ncommon symptom. So, also, stupor or coma, or even convulsions, may\r\nsupervene from the poisonous action of urea and other waste or morbid\r\nproducts retained in the blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the treatment of acute nephritis the first consideration\r\nis the removal of the cause. Acrid or diuretic plants in the feed must be\r\nremoved, and what of this kind is present in the stomach or bowels may be\r\ncleared away by a moderate dose of castor or olive oil; extensive surfaces\r\nof inflammation that have been blistered by Spanish flies must be washed\r\nclean with soapsuds; sprains of the back or loins must be treated by\r\nsoothing fomentations or poultices or by a fresh sheepskin with its fleshy\r\nside applied on the loins, and the patient must be kept in a narrow stall\r\nin which it can not turn even its head. The patient must be kept in a warm,\r\ndry building, so that the skin may be kept active rather than the kidneys.\r\nWarm blanketing is equally important, or even mustard poultices over the\r\nloins will be useful. Blisters of Spanish flies, turpentine, or other agent\r\nwhich may be absorbed and irritate the kidneys must be avoided. The active\r\nfever may be checked by 15 drops tincture of aconite every four hours or by\r\none-third ounce of acetanilid. If pain is very acute, 1 ounce of laudanum\r\nor 2 drams of solid extract of belladonna will serve to relieve. When the\r\nseverity of the disease has passed, a course of tonics (quinin, 2 drams, or\r\ngentian powder, 4 drams, daily) may be given. Diuretics, too, may be given\r\ncautiously at this advanced stage to relieve dropsy and give tone to the\r\nkidneys and general system (oil of turpentine, 2 teaspoonfuls; bicarbonate\r\nof soda, 1 teaspoonful, repeated twice a day). Pure water is essential, and\r\nit should not be given chilled; warm drinks are preferable.\r\n\r\nIn the chronic forms of kidney inflammation the same protection against\r\ncold and similar general treatment are demanded. Tonics, however, are\r\nimportant to improve the general health (phosphate of iron, 2 drams;\r\npowdered nux vomica, 20 grains; powdered gentian root, 4 drams, daily). In\r\nsome instances the mineral acids (nitric acid, 60 drops, or\r\nnitrohydrochloric acid, 60 drops, daily) may be used with the bitters.\r\nMustard applied to the loins in the form of a thin pulp made with water and\r\ncovered for an hour with paper or other impervious envelope, or water\r\nhotter than the hand can bear, or cupping, may be resorted to as a\r\ncounterirritant. In cupping, shave the loins, smear them with lard, then\r\ntake a narrow-mouthed glass, expand the air within by smearing its interior\r\nwith a few drops of alcohol, setting it on fire and instantly pressing the\r\nmouth of the vessel to the oiled portion of the skin. As the air within the\r\nvessel cools it contracts, tending to form a partial vacuum, and the skin,\r\ncharged with blood, is strongly drawn up within it. Several of these being\r\napplied at once, a strong derivation from the affected kidneys is obtained.\r\nIn no case of inflamed or irritable kidney should Spanish flies or oil of\r\nturpentine be used upon the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES OF THE KIDNEY.\r\n\r\nAs the kidney is the visual channel by which the bacteria leave the system,\r\nthis organ is liable to be implicated when microphytes exist in the blood,\r\nand congestions and blood extravasions are produced. In anthrax, southern\r\ncattle fever (Texas fever), and other such affections bloody urine is the\r\nconsequence. Of the larger parasites attacking the kidney may be specially\r\nnamed the cystic form of the echinococcus tapeworm of the dog, the cystic\r\nform of the unarmed or beef tapeworm of man, the diving bladderworm--the\r\ncystic form of the marginate tapeworm of the dog, and the giant strongyle--\r\nthe largest of the roundworms. These give rise to general symptoms of\r\nkidney disease, but the true source of the trouble is likely to be detected\r\nonly if the heads or hooklets of the tapeworm or the eggs of the roundworm\r\nare found on microscopical examination of the urine.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE KIDNEY (HYPERTROPHY OR ATROPHY).\r\n\r\nThe kidney may be the seat of cancerous or simple tumors, and it may be\r\nunnaturally enlarged or reduced in size, but though there may be signs of\r\nurinary disorder the true nature of the disease is seldom manifest until\r\nafter death. The passing of blood and of large multi-nucleated cells in\r\nthe urine (to be detected under the microscope) may betray the existence of\r\nan ulcerated cancer of the kidney. The presence of cancerous enlargement of\r\n(superficial) lymphatic glands may further assist and confirm the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETENTION OF URINE.\r\n\r\nInability to pass urine may come from any one of three conditions--first,\r\nspasm of the neck of the bladder; second, paralysis of the body of the\r\nbladder; third, obstruction of the channel of outlet by a stone (calculus)\r\n(see Pl. XI) or other obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn _spasm of the neck of the bladder_ the male animal may stand with the\r\ntail slightly raised and making rhythmical contractions of the muscle\r\nbeneath the anus (accelerator urinÊ) (see Pl. IX, fig. 2), but without\r\npassing a drop of liquid. In the female the hind legs are extended, widely\r\nparted, and the back is arched as if to urinate, but the effort is vain. If\r\nthe oiled hand is introduced into the rectum or vagina in the early stages\r\nof the affection, the bladder may be felt beneath partially filled, but not\r\noverdistended with liquid, and its neck or mouth firm and rigid. In the\r\nmore advanced stages of the affection the organ is felt as a great, tense,\r\nelastic bag, extending forward into the abdomen. In this condition the\r\noverdistended muscular coat of the bladder has lost its power of\r\ncontraction, so that true paralysis has set in, the muscle closing the\r\nmouth of the sac alone retaining its contractile power.\r\n\r\nIn _paralysis of the body of the bladder_ attention is rarely drawn to the\r\nurinary disorder until the bladder has been distended to full repletion and\r\nis almost ready to give way by rupture and to allow the escape of the\r\ncontained liquid into the abdomen. Overdistention is the most common cause\r\nof the paralysis, yet it may occur from inflammation of the muscular wall\r\nof the bladder, or even from injury to the terminal part of the spinal\r\nmarrow. In this last condition, however, the tail is liable to be\r\npowerless, and the neck of the bladder may also be paralyzed, so that the\r\nurine dribbles away continuously.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Among the causes of spasm of the neck of the bladder may be\r\nnamed the lodgment of small stones or gravel, the feeding on irritant\r\ndiuretics (see \"Bloody urine,\" p. 119, or \"Nephritis,\" p. 123), the\r\nenforced retention of urine while at work or during a painful or difficult\r\nparturition. The irritation attendant on inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane of the bladder may be a further cause of spasms of the neck, as\r\nmay also be inflammation of the channel (urethra) back of the neck.\r\nExtensive applications of Spanish flies to the skin, the abuse of\r\ndiuretics, and the occurrence of indigestion and spasms of the bowels are\r\nfurther causes. So long as spasmodic colic is unrelieved, retention of\r\nwater from spasm of the neck of the bladder usually persists.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment depends largely on the cause. In indigestion the\r\nirritant contents of the bowels must be got rid of by laxatives and\r\ninjections of warm water; Spanish-fly blisters must be washed from the\r\nsurface; a prolonged and too active exertion must be intermitted. The spasm\r\nmay be relaxed by injecting one-half ounce of solid extract of belladonna\r\nin water into the rectum or by a solution of tobacco. Chloroform or ether\r\nmay be given by inhalation, or chloral hydrate (1 ounce) may be given in\r\nwater by the mouth. Fomentations of warm water may be made over the loins\r\nand between the thighs, and the oiled hand inserted into the rectum may\r\npress moderately on the anterior part of the bladder, which can be felt as\r\nan elastic fluctuating bag of an oval shape just beneath.\r\n\r\nAll other measures failing, the liquid must be drawn off through a tube\r\n(catheter). This is, however, exceedingly difficult, alike in male and\r\nfemale, and we can not expect an amateur to succeed in accomplishing it. In\r\nthe cow the opening into the bladder is found in the median line of the\r\nfloor of the generative entrance, about 4 inches in front of the external\r\nopening, but it is flanked on either side by a blind pouch, into which the\r\ncatheter will pass, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, in the hands of\r\nany but the most skilled operator. In the bull or steer the penis, when\r\nretracted into its sheath, is bent upon itself like the letter S, just\r\nabove the scrotum and testicles (see Pl. IX, fig. 2), and unless this bend\r\nis effaced by extending the organ forward out of its sheath it is quite\r\nimpossible to pass a catheter beyond this point. When, however, by the\r\npresentation of a female, the animal can be tempted to protrude the penis,\r\nso that it can be seized and extended, or when it can be manipulated\r\nforward out of the sheath, it becomes possible to pass a catheter of small\r\ncaliber (one-third inch or under) onward into the bladder. Youatt advised\r\nlaying open the sheath so as to reach and extend the penis, and others have\r\nadvocated opening the urethra in the space between the thighs or just\r\nbeneath the anus, but such formidable operations are beyond the stock\r\nowner. The incision of the narrow urethra through the great thickness of\r\nmuscular and erectile bleeding tissue just beneath the anus is especially\r\nan operation of extreme delicacy and difficulty. Drawing the liquid through\r\nthe tube of an aspirator is another possible resort for the professional\r\nman. The delicate needle of the aspirator is inserted in such cases through\r\nthe floor of the vagina and upper wall of the bladder in the female, or\r\nthrough the floor of the rectum (last gut) and roof of the bladder in the\r\nmale, or finally through the lower and back part of the abdominal wall,\r\njust in front of the bones of the pelvis (pubic bones), thence through the\r\nlower and anterior part of the bladder near its blind anterior end. After\r\nrelief has been obtained the administration of belladonna in 2-dram doses\r\ndaily for several days will tend to prevent a recurrence of the retention.\r\n\r\nWhen the body of the bladder has become benumbed or paralyzed by\r\noverdistention, we may seek to restore its tone by doses of one-half a dram\r\nof powdered nux vomica repeated daily, and by mustard plaster applied over\r\nthe loins, on the back part of the belly inferiorly, or between the thighs.\r\nSmall doses (2 drams) of balsam of copaiba are sometimes useful in\r\nimparting tone to the partly paralyzed organ.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCONTINENCE OF URINE (PALSY OF THE NECK OF THE BLADDER).\r\n\r\nThis may occur from disease or injury to the posterior part of the spinal\r\ncord or from broken back, and in these cases the tail, and perhaps the hind\r\nlimbs, are liable to be paralyzed. In this case the urine dribbles away\r\nconstantly, and the oiled hand in the vagina or rectum will feel the\r\nhalf-filled and flaccid bladder beneath and may easily empty it by\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is only successful when the cause of the trouble\r\ncan be remedied. After these (sprains of the back, etc.) have recovered,\r\nblisters (mustard) on the loins, the lower part of the abdomen, or between\r\nthe thighs may be resorted to with success. Two drams of copaiba or of\r\nsolid extract of belladonna or 2 grains Spanish flies daily may serve to\r\nrestore the lost tone. These failing, the use of electric currents may\r\nstill prove successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nURINARY CALCULI (STONE OR GRAVEL).\r\n\r\nStone or gravel consists of hard bodies mainly made up of the solid earthy\r\nconstituents of the urine which have crystallized out of that liquid at\r\nsome part of the urinary passage, and have remained as small particles\r\n(gravel), or have concreted into large masses (stone, calculus). (See Pl.\r\nXI, figs. 1, 2, 3.) In cattle it is no uncommon thing to find them\r\ndistending the practically microscopic tubes in the red substance of the\r\nkidney, having been deposited from the urine in the solid form almost as\r\nsoon as that liquid has been separated from the blood. These stones appear\r\nas white objects on the red ground formed by cutting sections of the\r\nkidney, and are essentially products of the dry feed of winter, and are\r\nmost common in working oxen, which are called upon to exhale more water\r\nfrom the lungs and skin than are the slop-fed and inactive cows. Little\r\nwater being introduced into the body with the feed and considerable being\r\nexpelled with the breath and perspiration in connection with the active\r\nlife, the urine becomes small in amount, but having to carry out all waste\r\nmaterial from the tissues and the tissue-forming feed it becomes so charged\r\nwith solids that it is ready to deposit them on the slightest disturbance.\r\nIf, therefore, a little of the water of such concentrated urine is\r\nreabsorbed at any point of the urinary passages the remainder is no longer\r\nable to hold the solids in solution, and they are at once precipitated in\r\nthe solid form as gravel or commencing stone. In cattle, on the other hand,\r\nwhich are kept at pasture in summer, or which are fed liberally on roots,\r\npotatoes, pumpkins, apples, or ensilage in winter, this concentrated\r\ncondition of the urine is not induced, and under such circumstances,\r\ntherefore, the formation of stone is practically unknown. Nothing more need\r\nbe said to show the controlling influence of dry feeding in producing\r\ngravel and of a watery ration in preventing it. Calculus in cattle is\r\nessentially a disease of winter and of such cattle as are denied succulent\r\nfeed and are confined to dry fodder as their exclusive ration. While there\r\nare exceptions, they are so rare that they do not invalidate this general\r\nrule. It is true that stone in the kidney or bladder is often found in the\r\nsummer or in animals feeding at the time on a more or less succulent\r\nration, yet such masses usually date back to a former period when the\r\nanimals were restricted to a dry ration.\r\n\r\nIn this connection is should be noted that a great drain of water from the\r\nsystem by any other channel than the kidneys predisposes to the production\r\nof gravel or stone. In case of profuse diarrhea, for example, or of\r\nexcessive secretion of milk, there is a corresponding diminution of the\r\nwater of the blood, and as the whole quantity of the blood is thus\r\ndecreased and as the urine secreted is largely influenced by the fullness\r\nof the blood vessels and the pressure exerted upon their walls from within,\r\nit follows that with this decrease of the mass of the blood and the\r\nlessening of its pressure outward there will be a corresponding decrease of\r\nurine. The waste of the tissues, however, goes on as before, and if the\r\nwaste matter is passed out through the kidneys it must be in a more\r\nconcentrated solution, and the more concentrated the urine the greater the\r\ndanger that the solids will be deposited as small crystals or calculi.\r\n\r\nAgain, the concentrated condition of the urine which predisposes to such\r\ndeposits is favored by the quantity of lime salts that may be present in\r\nthe water drunk by the animal. Water that contains 20 or 30 grains of\r\ncarbonate or sulphate of lime to the gallon must contribute a large\r\naddition of solids to the blood and urine as compared with soft waters from\r\nwhich lime is absent. In this connection it is a remarkable fact that stone\r\nand gravel in the domesticated herbivora are notoriously prevalent on many\r\nlimestone soils, as on the limestone formations of central and western New\r\nYork, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan; on the calcareous formations of\r\nNorfolk, Suffolk, Derbyshire, Shropshire, and Gloucestershire, in England;\r\nin Landes in France, and around Munich in Bavaria. It does not follow that\r\nthe abundance of lime in the water and fodder is the main cause of the\r\ncalculi, as other poisons which are operative in the same districts in\r\ncausing goiter in both man and animal probably contribute to the trouble,\r\nyet the excess of earthy salts in the drinking water can hardly fail to add\r\nto the saturation of both blood and urine, and thereby to favor the\r\nprecipitation of the urinary solids from their state of solution.\r\n\r\nThe known results of feeding cattle a generous or forcing ration in which\r\nphosphate of lime is present to excess adds additional force to the view\r\njust advanced. In the writer's experience, the Second Duke of Oneida, a\r\nmagnificent product of his world-famed family, died as the result of a too\r\nliberal allowance of wheat bran, fed with the view of still further\r\nimproving the bone and general form of the Duchess strain of Shorthorns.\r\nLithotomy was performed and a number of stones removed from the bladder and\r\nurethra, but the patient succumbed to an inflammation of the bowels,\r\ninduced by the violent purgatives given before the writer arrived, under\r\nthe mistaken idea that the straining had been caused by intestinal\r\nimpaction. In this case not only the Second Duke of Oneida, but the other\r\nmales of the herd as well, had the tufts of hairs at the outlet of the\r\nsheath encased in hard, cylindroid sheaths of urinary salts, precipitated\r\nfrom the liquid as it ran over them. The tufts were in reality resolved\r\ninto a series of hard, rollerlike bodies, more or less constricted at\r\nintervals, as if beaded.\r\n\r\nWhen it is stated that the ash of the whole grain of wheat is but 3 per\r\ncent, while the ash of wheat bran is 7.3 per cent, and that in the case of\r\nthe former 46.38 per cent of the ash is phosphoric acid, and in that of the\r\nlatter 50 per cent, it can easily be understood how a too liberal use of\r\nwheat bran should prove dangerous if fed dry. The following table shows the\r\nrelative proportion of ash and phosphoric acid in wheat bran and in some\r\ncommon farm seeds:\r\n\r\n  _Ash and phosphoric acid in bran and some common farm seeds._\r\n\r\n  --------------------+----------+-------------+---------------\r\n  Kind of grain.      |    Ash.  | Phosphoric  |  Phosphoric\r\n                      |          |acid in ash. |  acid in the\r\n                      |          |             |  entire feed.\r\n  --------------------+----------+-------------+---------------\r\n                      |_Per cent_| _Per cent_  |  _Per cent_\r\n  Wheat bran          |    7.3   |     50      |      3.65\r\n  Wheat, grain        |    3     |     46.38   |      1.3914\r\n  Oats, grain         |    2.50  |     26.5    |       .6625\r\n  Barley, grain       |    3.10  |     39.6    |      1.2276\r\n  Bean, grain         |    3.10  |     31.9    |       .9864\r\n  Peas, grain         |    2.75  |     34.8    |       .957\r\n  Tare, grain         |    3     |     36.2    |      1.086\r\n  Indian corn, grain. |    1.5   |      --     |       --\r\n  Rye, grain          |    1.6   |     39.9    |       .6384\r\n  --------------------+----------+-------------+---------------\r\n\r\nWheat bran, it will be observed, contains three times as much phosphoric\r\nacid as is found in any of the other grains, and four times as much as\r\noats, beans, peas, or rye; so that if fed in excess it will readily\r\novercharge the urine with phosphates.\r\n\r\nThere is another point to be considered, however, in estimating this\r\ndanger. Wheat bran contains a far greater quantity of albuminoids and other\r\nnitrogen-containing constituents than the common grains (these being made\r\nup mainly of starch, which contains no nitrogen); and, all nitrogen-bearing\r\nproducts contained in the blood and tissues being expelled from the body\r\nmainly through the kidneys in the form of urea and (in cattle) hippuric\r\nacid, it follows that the excess of urea formed when such feed is consumed\r\nmust load the urine with solids and bring it constantly nearer to the point\r\nof saturation, when such solids (or the least soluble of them) must be\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nThe following table will show the relative amounts of the nitrogen-bearing\r\nproducts in wheat bran and some of our common grains:\r\n\r\n  _Nitrogenous matter in wheat bran and some common farm grains._\r\n\r\n  -----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------------\r\n  Kind of grain.   |  Albuminoids  |  Woody fiber   | Total nitrogenous-\r\n                   | (nitrogenous).| (nitrogenous.) | bearing constituents.\r\n  -----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------------\r\n                   |  _Per cent_   |   _Per cent_   |  _Per cent_\r\n  Wheat bran.      |     16.1      |      8         |     24.1\r\n  Wheat, grain     |     12.5      |      1.8       |     14.3\r\n  Barley, grain    |     12.4      |      2.7       |     15.1\r\n  Oats, grain      |     11.8      |      9.5       |     21.3\r\n  Rye, grain       |     10.6      |      1.7       |     12.3\r\n  Indian corn      |     10.1      |      1.7       |     11.8\r\n  -----------------+---------------+----------------+----------------------\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that, with the exception of oats, none of the grains\r\ncontain more than two-thirds of the nitrogenous material present in the\r\nwheat bran, while in the case of rye and maize there is practically but\r\none-half. Even in the case of oats the albuminoids, which are the more\r\ndigestible principles, and therefore those that are the most easily and\r\nspeedily converted into urea, are present only to the amount of two-thirds\r\nof that which exists in the wheat bran. With such an excess of ash, of\r\nphosphates, and of nitrogenous (urea-forming) constituents in wheat bran,\r\nits tendency to favor the formation of calculi is fully explained. It must\r\nnot, however, be inferred that wheat bran is not a valuable feedstuff. The\r\ninference is only that it should be fed with an abundance of water, as a\r\nsloppy mash, or in combination with an abundance of roots, potatoes,\r\npumpkins, or other succulent aliment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the presence of magnesia in the feed or water must be\r\nnamed as favoring calculous formations in the urinary passages. The\r\nexplanation is that while the phosphate of magnesia thrown out in the urine\r\nis soluble in water, the compound phosphate of ammonia and magnesia is\r\ninsoluble, and, accordingly, if at any time ammonia is introduced into\r\nurine containing the phosphate of magnesia there is instantly formed the\r\nammonio-magnesium phosphate, which is as promptly deposited in the solid\r\nform. The common source of ammonia in such cases is from decomposition of\r\nthe urea in fermenting urine. In order to produce this a ferment is\r\nnecessary, however, and therefore, as an additional prerequisite, the\r\npresence of bacteria, or fungi, in the urine is essential. These ferments\r\nmay make their way from without along the urinary passage (urethra), and\r\ntheir propagation in the bladder is greatly favored by the prolonged\r\nretention of urine, as in case of spasm of the neck of the bladder or\r\nobstruction by an already existing stone. Another mode of entrance of the\r\nferment is an unclean catheter used to draw the urine. Still another is the\r\nelimination through the kidneys of the bacteria of infectious diseases, or\r\nof such as, without producing a general infection, yet determine\r\nfermentation in the urine. The precipitation is favored not only by the\r\nproduction of ammonia, but also by the formation of viscid (colloid)\r\nproducts of fermentation. In this sense bacteria are most important factors\r\nin causing gritty deposits in the urine.\r\n\r\nAnother insoluble salt which enters largely into the composition of many\r\nurinary calculi of the ox is carbonate of lime. This is derived mainly from\r\nthe lime in the feed and water and from the carbon dioxid formed by the\r\noxidation of the organic acids in the fodder. These organic acids, being\r\ncomposed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen (without nitrogen), are resolved\r\nby the addition of oxygen into carbon dioxid (CO_{2}) and water (H_{2}O).\r\nThe carbon dioxid unites with the lime in the blood to form carbonate of\r\nlime, and in this state passes into the urine. Now, carbonate of lime is\r\nsoluble in water containing free or uncombined carbon dioxid, but is\r\nprecipitated whenever the latter is withdrawn. It is only necessary,\r\ntherefore, to have in the urine sufficient lime or other available base to\r\nunite with all the free carbon dioxid in order to bring about the\r\nprecipitation of the dissolved carbonate of lime in the solid, crystallized\r\nform; hence it is that, of all sediments in the urine of herbivora, this is\r\nthe most frequent and usually the most abundant.\r\n\r\nA less common constituent of urinary calculi is the insoluble oxalate of\r\nlime. In this case the lime is derived as before from the feed or water, or\r\nboth, while the oxalic acid is a product of the oxidation of organic acids\r\nof the feed, less oxygen having been used than in the formation of carbon\r\ndioxid. The final product of the complete oxidation of these acids is\r\ncarbon dioxid, but when less oxygen is furnished, owing to some disease of\r\nthe lungs or a disease of the nerve centers, which lessens the activity of\r\nthe breathing, then oxalic acid may be produced. If this oxalic acid comes\r\ninto contact with lime, it is instantly precipitated as crystals of oxalate\r\nof lime.\r\n\r\nAnother inorganic substance at times found in urinary calculi is silica\r\n(SiO_{2}). This contributes largely to giving stiffness to the stems of\r\ngrowing plants, and in most of our cereals and grasses makes up a large\r\nproportion of the ashes of the burned plant. It is found in the soluble\r\nform in combination as silicate of potash, but at times is displaced by\r\noxalic or other acid and then appears as gritty, sandy particles in the\r\nstem. This gritty, insoluble silica is especially noticeable among the\r\nhorsetails (_EquisetacÊceÊ_), bamboos, and sedges. The per cent of silica\r\nin the ash of several common fodder plants is given below:\r\n\r\n  _Silica in ash of various fodder plants._\r\n\r\n  Ash of--            Silica.\r\n                    _Per cent._\r\n\r\n  Wheat straw         67.6\r\n  Oats and husk       38.6\r\n  Oat straw           35.4\r\n  Barley straw        73.1\r\n  Rye straw           64.4\r\n  Rye-grass hay       64.57\r\n  Wheat chaff         81.2\r\n  Oat chaff           59.9\r\n  Barley awn          70.7\r\n\r\nIt is only soluble silica that is taken up into the system, and it is in\r\nthis form (usually as silicate of potash or soda) that it enters the urine,\r\nbut all that is wanted to precipitate it in crystalline form as a gritty\r\nsand is the presence of oxalic or other acid having a stronger affinity for\r\nits base (potash or soda).\r\n\r\nOther conditions, however, enter largely into the causation of stone, or\r\ngravel. A high density of urine resulting from a highly saturated condition\r\nis often present for a length of time without any precipitation of solid\r\nmaterials. Urea and carbonates may be present in excess, the feed may be\r\ngiven dry, and drinking water may be deficient in quantity without any\r\ndeposition of stone or gravel. In such cases, the presence of\r\nnoncrystalline organic matter in the urine becomes an exciting cause.\r\nRainey and Ord have shown experimentally that colloid (noncrystallizable)\r\nbodies like mucus, epithelial cells, albumin, pus, blood, hyaline casts of\r\nthe kidney tubes, etc., not only determine the precipitation of\r\ncrystallizable salts from a strong solution, but they determine the\r\nprecipitation in the form of globular masses, or minute spheres, which, by\r\nfurther similar accessions, become stones, or calculi, of various sizes.\r\nThe salts that are deposited by mere chemical reaction without the\r\nintervention of colloids appear in the form of sharply defined angular\r\ncrystals, and hence the rough, jagged crystals of oxalate of lime or\r\nammonia-magnesium phosphate. Heat intensifies the action of the colloids in\r\ncausing precipitation of the dissolved salts, so that the temperatures of\r\nthe kidneys and bladder constitute favorable conditions. Colloids that are\r\nundergoing decomposition are also specially powerful, so that the presence\r\nof bacteria or fungi causing fermentation is an important factor.\r\n\r\nIn looking, therefore, for the immediate causes of urinary calculi we must\r\naccord a high place to all those conditions which determine the presence of\r\nexcess of mucus, albumin, pus, blood, kidney casts, blood-coloring matter,\r\netc., in the urine. A catarrhal inflammation of the pelvis of the kidney,\r\nof the ureter, or of the bladder, generating excess of mucus or pus;\r\ninflammation of the kidneys, causing the discharge of blood, albumin, or\r\nhyaline casts into the urinary passages; inflammation of the liver, lungs,\r\nor other distant organ, resulting in the escape of albumin in the urine;\r\ndisorders of the liver or of the blood-forming functions, resulting in\r\nhematuria or hemoglobinuria; sprains or other injuries to the back, or\r\ndisease of the spinal marrow, which cause the escape of blood with the\r\nurine; the presence in the bladder of a bacterial ferment, which determines\r\nthe decomposition of the mucus and urea, the evolution of ammonia and the\r\nconsequent destruction of the protecting cellular (epithelia) lining of the\r\nbladder, or the irritation caused by the presence of an already formed\r\ncalculus, may produce the colloid or uncrystallizable body that proves so\r\neffective in the precipitation of stone or gravel. It has long been known\r\nthat calculi almost invariably form around any foreign body introduced into\r\nthe kidney or bladder, and I have seen a large, calculous mass surrounding\r\na splinter of an arrow that had penetrated and broken off in the body of a\r\ndeer. The explanation is now satisfactory--the foreign body carries in with\r\nit bacteria, which act as ferments upon the urine and mucus in addition to\r\nthe mechanical injury caused by its presence. If such a body has been\r\nintroduced through the solid tissues, there is, in addition, the presence\r\nof the blood and lymph derived from the wounded structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF URINARY CALCULI.\r\n\r\nUrinary calculi are most conveniently divided according to the locality in\r\nwhich they are found. Thus we find first renal calculi, formed in the\r\nkidney (Pl. XI, fig. 1), and which for cattle must be again divided into\r\ncalculi of the uriniferous tubes and calculi of the pelvis. The second\r\nclass are named ureteral calculi because they are found in the duct leading\r\nfrom the kidney to the bladder (ureter). The third class are the vesical\r\ncalculi, from the bladder or vesicle in which they are found. The fourth\r\nclass are the urethral calculi, and are found in the duct leading outward\r\nfrom the bladder through the penis (urethra). The fifth and last class are\r\nthe preputial calculi, since they are found within the sheath of the penis\r\n(prepuce).\r\n\r\nCalculi may also be classed according to their chemical composition and\r\nthis has the advantage of suggesting the special cause of each as found in\r\nthe feed, water, soil, or general conditions of health. This classification\r\naffords no guide to their location or symptoms, as calculi of the same\r\nchemical composition may be formed at any part of the urinary passages, as\r\nthose formed in the kidney may pass on through all the various passages\r\noutward, unless it is found at any point of their progress that they have\r\ngrown so large that the passage will not admit them. The following are\r\namong the concretions found in the various parts:\r\n\r\n(1) _Coralline calculi._--These are of a dull-white color and irregular\r\nsurface, like coral. They are made up of hard and resistant layers evenly\r\ndeposited around a central nucleus. (Pl. XI, fig. 3.) Their specific\r\ngravity is 1,760, water being 1,000, and they contain 74 per cent of\r\ncarbonate of lime with some carbonate of magnesia, organic matter, and a\r\ntrace of carbonate of iron. Yellowish-white, smooth, round calculi of the\r\nsame chemical composition are met with.\r\n\r\n(2) _Pearly calculi._--These are more frequent than the first-named\r\nvariety. They are very hard and smooth on the surface, reflecting a play of\r\nvarious colors after the fashion of a pearl. This peculiarity appears to be\r\ncaused by the thinness and semitransparency of the supposed layers. They\r\nhave a specific gravity of 2,109 to 2,351, and nearly the same chemical\r\ncomposition as the coralline variety. Golding Bird found a specimen of this\r\nkind formed of carbonate of lime and organic matter only.\r\n\r\n(3) _Green calculi_ (_metalloid calculi_).--These are usually small and\r\nnumerous, as they are exceedingly common. They are of a very hard\r\nconsistency, and have a clear-polished, greenish surface of almost metallic\r\nbrilliancy. They have a specific gravity of 2.301 and a composition almost\r\nidentical with the second variety.\r\n\r\n(4) _White calculi._--Pure white, smooth, lustrous calculi are rare. They\r\nhave a specific gravity of 2.307, and contain as much as 92 per cent of\r\ncarbonate of lime with carbonate of magnesia and organic matter.\r\n\r\n(5) _Ammonio-magnesium calculi._--These are of a grayish color and a very\r\nrough, crystalline surface, which proves very irritating to the mucous\r\nmembrane. They have a specific gravity of 1.109 to 1.637, and are composed\r\nchiefly of ammonio-magnesium phosphate, oxalate of lime, and organic\r\nmatter, with a little carbonate of lime and magnesia.\r\n\r\n(6) _Siliceous calculi._--These are clear, smooth, and hard, and usually\r\nspherical. They have a specific gravity of 1.265 to 1.376, and contain 57\r\nper cent of silica with carbonates of iron and magnesia, organic matter,\r\nand traces of iron. In other specimens of siliceous calculi there was a\r\nspecific gravity of 3.122, and there was 79 to 85 per cent of carbonate of\r\nlime together with carbonate of magnesia, and iron, silica, and organic\r\nmatter. Others are almost exclusively made of silica.\r\n\r\n(7) _Oxalate of lime calculi_ (_mulberry calculi_) (Pl. XI, fig. 2).--\r\nThese are characterized by their extremely rough, angular surface, formed\r\nby the octahedral crystals of oxalate of lime. Their specific gravity may\r\nbe 3.441, and they contain oxalate of lime to the extent of 81 per cent,\r\ntogether with carbonates of lime and magnesia and organic matter.\r\n\r\n(8) _Gravel_ (_pultaceous deposits_).--Simple crystals may be met with at\r\nany point from the kidneys to the external opening at the end of the\r\nprepuce (sheath), and they may appear singly, as crystals, or they may\r\naccumulate in masses of fine spherical crystals almost like dirty powdered\r\nchalk suspended in water. In the ox this is especially common as a\r\ncollection in the sheath, distending that into a soft, doughy swelling.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMS OF CALCULI IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS.\r\n\r\nApart from the rough crystalline surfaces of the calculi of oxalate of lime\r\nand ammonio-magnesium phosphate, the general tendency is to a smooth, round\r\noutline. At times, however, they show more or less flattening with rounded\r\nangular edges, caused by the contact and mutual friction of two calculi.\r\nSometimes two or more stones lying together become united into one by a new\r\nexternal deposit, and the resulting mass then shows rounded swellings on\r\nopposite sides. The large calculi occupying the pelvis of the kidneys\r\nusually show a central part having the outline of the main cavity of the\r\npelvis and two or more projections that have been molded into the\r\ncorresponding branches or channels which lead to corresponding lobes of the\r\nkidney. In winter and spring small concretions in the form of plates are\r\noften met with in the branches of the pelvis, having been formed and molded\r\nin the confined space between the projecting papilla and the surrounding\r\ncuplike branch of the pelvis. Finally, the pulplike deposits in the sheath\r\nand elsewhere are made up of globular masses, individually so small as to\r\nbe often practically microscopic.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE IN THE KIDNEY (RENAL CALCULI).\r\n\r\n[Pl. XI, fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nIn an animal leading the quiet, uneventful life of the ox, stones of\r\nlarge size may be present in the kidney without producing any disorder\r\nappreciable to the people about him. In cattle fattened on dry feed in\r\nwinter, on the magnesian limestone of New York, it is exceptional to find\r\nthe substance of the kidney free from calculi about the size of a grain of\r\nwheat or less, and standing out as white objects in the general red of the\r\ncut surface of the organ. Similarly around the papillÊ in the cuplike arms\r\nof the pelvis we find minute, flattened or more or less rounded,\r\nyellowish-white concretions. Even the large concretions may prove\r\napparently harmless. I have a calculus several ounces in weight which\r\nfilled the entire pelvis of the kidney, that was found by accident in a\r\nfat carcass while being dressed. In work oxen, however, such concretions\r\nmay give rise to symptoms of kidney disease, such as stiffness of the\r\nloins, shown especially in the acts of rising or turning, weakness of the\r\nhind parts when set to pull a heavy load, an irritability of the kidneys,\r\nshown by the frequent passage of urine in small quantity, tenderness of\r\nthe loins, shown when they are pinched or lightly struck, and it may be\r\nthe passage of blood or minute gritty masses with the urine. If the attack\r\nis severe, what is called \"renal colic\" (kidney colic) may be shown by\r\nfrequent uneasy shifting of the hind limbs, shaking or twisting of the\r\ntail, looking around at the flanks, and lying down and rising again at\r\nshort intervals without apparent cause. The frequent passage of urine,\r\nthe blood or gritty masses contained in it, and perhaps the hard, stony\r\ncylinders around the tufts of hair of the sheath, show that the source\r\nof the suffering is the urinary organs. In bad cases active inflammation\r\nof the kidneys may set in. (See \"Nephritis,\" p. 123.)\r\n\r\n\r\nURETERAL CALCULI.\r\n\r\nThese are small stones which have passed from the pelvis of the kidney into\r\nthe canal (ureter) leading from the kidney to the bladder, but, being too\r\nlarge to pass on easily, have blocked that canal and forced the urine back\r\nupon the kidney. The result is the production of symptoms more violent than\r\nin renal calculi, though not varying, save in intensity, from those of\r\nrenal colic. In case of complete and unrelieved obstruction, the secretion\r\nof the kidney on that side is entirely abolished, and it becomes the seat\r\nof passive congestion, and it may even be absorbed in greater part or as a\r\nwhole, leaving only a fibrous sac containing fluid with a urinous odor. In\r\nsmall cattle, in which the oiled hand introduced into the last gut may\r\nreach the affected part, the distended ureter may be felt as a tense,\r\nelastic cord, extending forward from the point of obstruction on the\r\nlateral wall of the pelvis and beneath the loins toward the kidney. If\r\nrelief is obtained by the onward passage of the stone a free flow of urine\r\nusually follows, in the midst of which may often be found gritty masses. If\r\nthe outlets from both kidneys are similarly blocked the animal becomes\r\npoisoned by the retention in the blood of the elements of the urine, and by\r\ntheir reabsorption after secretion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of renal and ureteral calculi._--Treatment is not very\r\nsuccessful, as only the smallest calculi can pass through the ureter and\r\nenter the bladder, and even if they should do so they are liable to a\r\nprogressive increase there, so that later they may cause the symptoms of\r\nstone in the bladder. Fortunately, ordinary dairy, growing, or fattening\r\ncattle rarely show evident symptoms of illness, and even though they do so\r\nthey can usually be fattened and slaughtered before the health is seriously\r\nimpaired. In work oxen the case is different, and acute symptoms may\r\ndevelop, but even then the animal may often be fitted for the butcher. When\r\ntreatment is demanded it is primarily soothing and antispasmodic.\r\nFomentations with warm water over the loins should be persisted in without\r\nintermission until relief has been secured. The soothing effect on the\r\nkidney will often relieve inflammation and irritation, should the stone be\r\nin that situation, while if in the ureter the warm fomentations will at\r\nonce soothe irritation, relax spasm of the muscular coat of the canal, and\r\nfavor an abundant secretion from the kidney, which, pressing on the\r\nobstructing stone, may slowly push it on into the bladder. Large doses of\r\nlaudanum (2 ounces) or of solid extract of belladonna (2 drams) will not\r\nonly soothe the pain but relax the spasm and favor the onward passage of\r\nthe calculus. The animal should be encouraged to drink large quantities of\r\ncool water to favor the free secretion of a very watery urine, which will\r\nnot only serve to obviate irritation and continued deposit caused by a\r\nhighly concentrated urine, but will press the stone onward toward the\r\nbladder, and even in certain cases will tend to disintegrate it by solution\r\nof some of its elements, and thus to favor its crumbling and expulsion.\r\nThis is a principle which must never be lost sight of in the treatment of\r\ncalculi. The immersion of the stone in a liquid of a lower specific gravity\r\nthan that in which it has formed and grown tends to dissolve out the more\r\nsoluble of its component parts, and thus to destroy its density and\r\ncohesion at all points, and thereby to favor its complete disintegration\r\nand expulsion. This explains why cattle taken from a herd on magnesian\r\nlimestone in spring, after the long, dry feeding of winter, usually have\r\nrenal calculi, while cattle from the same herd in the fall, after a\r\nsummer's run on a succulent pasture, are almost always free from\r\nconcretions. The abundance of liquid taken in the green feed and expelled\r\nthrough the kidneys and the low density or watery nature of the urine have\r\nso opened the texture and destroyed the density of the smaller stones and\r\ngravel that they have all been disintegrated and removed. This, too, is the\r\nmain reason why benefit is derived from a prolonged stay at mineral springs\r\nby the human victims of gravel. If they had swallowed the same number of\r\nquarts of pure water at home and distributed it at suitable times each day,\r\nthey would have benefited largely without a visit to the springs.\r\n\r\nIt follows from what has been just said that a succulent diet, including a\r\nlarge quantity of water (gruels, sloppy mashes, turnips, beets, potatoes,\r\napples, pumpkins, ensilage, succulent grasses), is an important factor in\r\nthe relief of the milder forms of stone and gravel.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Prevention of calculus especially demands this supply of\r\nwater and watery rations on all soils and in all conditions in which there\r\nis a predisposition to the disease. It must also be sought by attempts to\r\nobviate all those conditions mentioned above as causative of the malady.\r\nSometimes good rain water can be furnished in limestone districts, but\r\nputrid or bad-smelling rain water is to be avoided as probably more\r\ninjurious than that from the limestone. Unsuccessful attempts have been\r\nmade to dissolve calculi by alkaline salts and mineral acids, respectively,\r\nbut their failure as a remedy does not necessarily condemn them as\r\npreventives. One dram of caustic potash or of hydrochloric acid may be\r\ngiven daily in the drinking water. In diametrically opposite ways these\r\nattack and decompose the less soluble salts and form new ones which are\r\nmore soluble and therefore little disposed to precipitate in the solid\r\nform. Both are beneficial as increasing the secretion of urine. In cases in\r\nwhich the diet has been too highly charged with phosphates (wheat bran,\r\netc.), these aliments must be restricted and water allowed ad libitum. If\r\nthe crystals passed with the urine are the sharp angular (octahedral) ones\r\nof oxalate of lime, then the breathing should be made more active by\r\nexercise, and any disease of the lungs subjected to appropriate treatment.\r\nIf the crystals are triangular prisms of ammonia-magnesium phosphate or\r\nstarlike forms with feathery rays, the indications are to withhold the feed\r\nor water that abounds in magnesia and check the fermentation in the urine\r\nby attempts to destroy its bacteria. In the latter direction plenty of\r\npure-water diuretics, and a daily dose of oil of turpentine in milk, or a\r\ndose thrice a day of a solution containing one-tenth grain each of biniodid\r\nof mercury and iodid of potassium would be indicated.\r\n\r\nIn considering the subject of prevention, it must never be forgotten that\r\nany disease of a distant organ which determines the passage from the blood\r\ninto the urine of albumin or any other colloid (uncrystallizable) body is\r\nstrongly provocative of calculus, and should, if possible, be corrected.\r\nApart from cases from geological formation, faulty feeding, and other\r\ncauses, the grand preventive of calculus is a long, summer's pasturage of\r\nsucculent grasses, or in winter a diet of ensilage or other succulent feed.\r\n\r\nThe calculi formed in part of silica demand special notice. This agent is\r\nsecreted in the urine in the form of silicate of potash and is thrown down\r\nas insoluble silica when a stronger acid displaces it by combining with the\r\npotash to its exclusion. In cases of siliceous calculi, accordingly, the\r\nappropriate chemical prevention is caustic potash, which being present in\r\nthe free state would attract to itself any free acid and leave the silica\r\nin its soluble condition as silicate of potash.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTONE IN THE BLADDER (VESICAL CALCULUS, OR URETHRAL CALCULUS).\r\n\r\nStone in the bladder may be of any size, but in the ox does not usually\r\nexceed half an inch in diameter. There may, however, be a number of small\r\ncalculi; indeed, they are sometimes so small and numerous as to form a\r\nsmall, pulpy magma by which the bladder is considerably distended.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of stone in the bladder may be absent until one\r\nof the masses escapes into the urethra, but when this occurs the escape of\r\nurine is prevented, or it is allowed to pass in drops or driblets only, and\r\nthe effect of such obstruction becomes manifest. The point of obstruction\r\nis not always the same, but it is most frequently at the S-shaped curve of\r\nthe penis, just above the testicles or scrotum. In cows and heifers the\r\nurethra is so short and becomes so widely dilated during the urination that\r\nthe calculi easily escape in the flow of liquid and dangerous symptoms\r\npractically never appear.\r\n\r\nEven in the male the signs of illness are at first very slight. A close\r\nobserver may notice the cylinders of hard, earthy materials encircling the\r\ntufts of hair at the opening of the prepuce. It may further be observed\r\nthat the stall remains dry and that the animal has not been seen to pass\r\nwater when out of doors. The tail may at times be gently raised and\r\ncontractions of the muscle (accelerator urinÊ) beneath the anus (Pl. IX,\r\nfig. 2) may take place in a rhythmical or pulsating manner. As a rule,\r\nhowever, no symptom is noticed for two days, only the animal is lacking in\r\nhis usual spirits. By this time the constantly accumulating urine has\r\ndistended the bladder beyond its power of resistance and a rupture occurs,\r\nallowing the urine to escape into the cavity of the abdomen. Then dullness\r\nincreases; the animal lies down most of his time; he becomes stupid and\r\nsometimes drowsy, with reddish-brown congestion of the lining membrane of\r\nthe eyelids; pressure on the abdomen causes pain, flinching, and perhaps\r\ngroaning, and the lowest part of the belly fluctuates more and more as the\r\nescaping urine accumulates in greater and greater amount. If at this stage\r\nthe oiled hand is introduced into the rectum (last gut), the animal\r\nflinches when pressure is made downward on the floor of the pelvis, and no\r\nround, distended bladder is felt. If the same examination is made prior to\r\nthe rupture, the rounded, tense, elastic bladder is felt extending forward\r\ninto the abdomen, containing one or two gallons of liquid. There may be\r\nuneasy shifting of the hind limbs and twisting of the tail, also frequent\r\nlying down and rising, but these symptoms are exceptional.\r\n\r\nWhen the obstruction is low down between the thighs (at the S-shaped\r\nflexure), the line of the pulsating urethra from the anus downward may be\r\nfelt distended with liquid, and though, by the hard swelling of the\r\nurethra, it is seldom easy to distinguish the exact seat of the stone, yet\r\nthere is usually tenderness at the point of obstruction, and from this it\r\nmay be accurately located.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of stone in the bladder or urethra consists in\r\nthe removal of the stone by incision and the use of forceps. (Pl. XI, fig.\r\n4.) When the stone has been arrested at the S-shaped flexure just above the\r\nscrotum, the patient being lean, the thickened tender part of the penis may\r\nbe seized between the fingers and thumb of the left hand, while the\r\ncalculus is exposed by a free incision with the knife held in the right. If\r\nthere is no other obstruction between this point and the bladder, and if\r\nthe latter has not yet ruptured, a flow of urine should take place from the\r\nopening. If there is no escape of liquid, a catheter or sound, one-fourth\r\nof an inch in diameter, must be passed up through the canal (urethra) until\r\nit is arrested by the next stone, on which a similar incision should then\r\nbe made to effect its extraction. In case the stone has been arrested in\r\nthe portion of the urethra which is in front of the arch of the hip bone\r\nand inside the pelvis, it can be reached only by making an opening into the\r\nurethra beneath the anus and over the arch of the hip bone, and from this\r\norifice exploring the urethra with fine forceps to the neck of the bladder\r\nor until the stone has been reached and extracted. Owing to the small size\r\nof the canal (urethra) to be opened and the great thickness of erectile\r\ntissue to be cut through, the operation requires a very accurate knowledge\r\nof the parts, while the free flow of blood is blinding to the operator. A\r\nstaff should always be passed up through the urethra from the lower wound,\r\nif such has been made, or, in case of its absence, through the whole length\r\nof the penis, that organ having been drawn out of its sheath until the\r\nS-shaped curve has been effaced and the course of the canal rendered\r\nstraight. Upon the end of this staff the incision can be made with far more\r\nconfidence and certainty. The operation can be undertaken only by a skilled\r\nveterinary anatomist, but the hints given above may be valuable in showing\r\nthe stock owner when he is being properly served in such a case.\r\n\r\nIn outlying districts, where no skilled operator can be had, a transverse\r\nincision may be made with a clean, sharp knife through the root of the\r\npenis, just over the arch of the hip bone, when the urine will flow out in\r\na full stream. The attendant bleeding may be ignored, or if profuse it may\r\nbe checked by packing the wound firmly with cotton wool for several hours.\r\nThe urine will continue to escape by the wound, and the ox should be\r\nfattened for the butcher.\r\n\r\nThe immediate relief is not to be looked upon as a permanent cure, as the\r\ncalculi in the affected ox are usually numerous, and later attacks are\r\ntherefore to be looked for. Hence it is desirable to fatten and kill such\r\ncases after a successful operation. If a breeding animal is too valuable to\r\nbe killed, he should be subjected to preventive measures, as laid down\r\nunder \"Stone in the kidney,\" page 139.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that when the bladder is filled with a soft magma a\r\ncatheter may be introduced through the whole length of the urethra to be\r\nused in pumping water into the bladder. This water is extracted through the\r\nsame channel when it has been charged with the suspended solids by\r\nmanipulations of the bladder with the oiled hand introduced through the\r\nrectum.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALCULI, OR GRAVEL, IN THE PREPUCE, OR SHEATH.\r\n\r\nThis is usually a collection of gravel, or a soft, puttylike material which\r\ncauses distinct swelling of the sheath and gives it a soft, doughy feeling\r\nwhen handled. It may be removed in part by the oiled fingers introduced\r\ninto the cavity, assisted by manipulation from without, or a tube may be\r\ninserted until the end extends behind the collection and water pumped in\r\nuntil the whole mass has been evacuated. Should even this fail of success,\r\nthe sheath may be slit open from its orifice back in the median line below\r\nuntil the offending matter can be reached and removed. In all such cases\r\nthe interior of the sheath should be finally lubricated with sweet oil or\r\nvaseline. It is unnecessary to stitch up the wound made in the sheath.

In this figure the minute apparatus for the secretion, collection,\r\nand discharge of the urine into the pelvis of the kidney (see preceding\r\nplate) is shown. The course is as follows: The urine is secreted from the\r\nblood vessels in the little round bodies called glomeruli (12), and by the\r\nminute cells in the curved tubes (11, 9, 10, 8), and passes through the\r\nconvoluted and straight tubes (7, 6) into the larger tube (1), and then out\r\ninto the pelvis, thence through the ureters into the bladder. The fluid and\r\nsalts dissolved in the urine are taken from the blood, and the minute blood\r\nvessels are therefore very abundant in the kidneys, as is shown by the\r\nbranches and network on the left of the figure. The blood passes into the\r\nkidney in the artery (13), which then divides into branches which pass into\r\nthe glomeruli (12) and also forms network around the secreting tubules (11,\r\n9). The urine and salts pass from these vessels through the cells lining\r\nthe tubules into the latter, and are discharged as described above. The\r\nblood is again collected in veins drawn black in the figure.\r\n\r\nFig. 2 illustrates the manner in which the blood is distributed in the\r\nglomerulus (_f_), and also to the secreting tubules (_e_).\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the relation between the blood vessel in the glomerulus (_e_)\r\nthe tubule which conducts the urine therein secreted from the blood vessel;\r\n(_c_) represents a glomerulus from which the urinary tubule has been\r\nremoved.\r\n\r\nPLATE XI.

R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University._\r\n\r\n[Revised by Adolph Eichhorn, D. V. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the generative organs are practically confined to animals which\r\nare kept for reproduction and the dairy. The castration of the bull\r\ncondemns these organs to inactivity and protects them from the many causes\r\nof injury attendant on the engorged blood vessels in the frequent periods\r\nof sexual excitement, on the exposure to mechanical violence, and on the\r\nexposure to infective inoculation. In three respects the castrated male is\r\nespecially subject to disease: (1) To inflammation and tumefaction of the\r\ncut end of the cord that supported the testicle and of the loose connective\r\ntissue of the scrotum; (2) to inflammation of the sheath and penis from the\r\naccumulation of gravel in the former, from which the penis is not usually\r\nprotruded in passing water; and (3) to bruising, abrasion, and inflammation\r\nof the sheath and penis during suspension in the stocks for the purpose of\r\nshoeing. Apart from these the ox is practically almost exempt from the\r\ninflammations and injuries of the genital organs. The same applies to the\r\ncastrated heifer. Inflammation may occur in the broad ligament of the womb\r\nwhence the ovary has been removed or infective inflammation in the\r\nabdominal cavity (peritonitis) in case the operation has been performed\r\nthrough the flank, as it usually is in the young heifer. Apart from these,\r\nthe castrated heifer is practically immune from any trouble of the\r\ngenerative apparatus. Even the virgin heifer is little subject to such\r\ntroubles, though she is not exempt from inflammations, and above all, from\r\nmorbid growths in the ovaries which are well developed and functionally\r\nvery active after the first year, or in precocious animals after the first\r\nfew months of life. The breeding cow, on the other hand, is subjected to\r\nall the disturbances attendant on the gradual enlargement of the womb, the\r\ndiversion of a large mass of blood to its walls, the constant drain of\r\nnutrient materials of all kinds for the nourishment of the fetus, the risks\r\nattendant and consequent on abortion and parturition, the dangers of\r\ninfection from the bull, the risks of sympathetic disturbance in case of\r\nserious diseases of other organs, but preeminently of the urinary organs\r\nand the udder, and finally the sudden extreme derangements of the\r\ncirculation and of the nervous functions which attend on the sudden\r\nrevulsion of a great mass of blood from the walls of the contracting womb\r\ninto the body at large immediately after calving.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing this class of diseases, therefore, we have to note, first,\r\nthat they are almost exclusively restricted to breeding animals, and\r\nsecondly that in keeping with the absolute difference of the organs in the\r\nmale and female we find two essentially distinct lists of diseases\r\naffecting the two sexes.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXCESS OF VENEREAL DESIRE (SATYRIASIS IN MALE, OR NYMPHOMANIA IN FEMALE).\r\n\r\nThis may occur in the male from too frequent sexual intercourse, or from\r\ninjury and congestion of the base of the brain (vasodilator center in the\r\nmedulla), or of the posterior end of the spinal cord, or it may be kept up\r\nby congestion or inflammation of the testicles or of the mucous membrane\r\ncovering the penis. It may be manifested by a constant or frequent\r\nerection, by attempts at sexual connection, and sometimes by the discharge\r\nof semen without connection. In bad cases the feverishness and restlessness\r\nlead to loss of flesh, emaciation, and physical weakness.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the female especially that this morbid desire is most\r\nnoticeable and injurious. It may be excited by the stimulating quality of\r\nthe blood in cows fed to excess on highly nitrogenous feed, as the seeds of\r\nthe bean, pea, vetch, and tare, and as wheat bran, middlings, cotton seed,\r\ngluten meal, etc., especially in the case of such as have no free exercise\r\nin the fields, and are subject to constant association with a vigorous\r\nyoung bull. A more frequent cause is the excitation or congestion of some\r\npart of the genital organs. Disease of the ovaries is preeminently the\r\ncause, and this may be by the formation of cysts (sacs containing liquid)\r\nor of solid tumors or degenerations, or, more commonly than all, the\r\nformation of tubercle. Indeed, in case of tuberculosis attacking the\r\nabdominal organs of cows, the ovaries or the serous membranes that support\r\nand cover them (the broad ligaments of the womb) are peculiarly subject to\r\nattack, and the animal has constant sexual excitement, incessantly riding\r\nor being ridden by other cattle, having no leisure to eat or chew the cud,\r\nbut moving restlessly, wearing the flesh off its bones, and gradually\r\nwasting. In some localities these cows are known as \"bullers,\" because they\r\nare nearly always disposed to take the bull, but they do not conceive, or,\r\nif they do, they are subject to early abortions. They are, therefore,\r\nuseless alike for the dairy and for the feeder, unless the removal of the\r\novaries subdues the sexual excitement, when, in the absence of tuberculous\r\ndisease elsewhere, they may be fattened for the butcher.\r\n\r\nAmong the other sources of irritation charged with causing nymphomania are\r\ntumors and cancers of the womb, rigid closure of the neck of the womb so\r\nthat conception can not occur and the frequent services by the male which\r\nstimulate the unsatisfied appetite, inflammation, and a purulent discharge\r\nfrom the womb or vagina.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment in each case will vary with the cause and is\r\nmost satisfactory when that cause is a removable one. Overfeeding on richly\r\nnitrogenous feed can be stopped, exercise in the open field given, diseased\r\novaries may be removed (see \"Castration,\" p. 299), catarrhs of the womb and\r\npassages overcome by antiseptic, astringent injections (see \"Leucorrhea,\"\r\np. 224), and tumors of the womb may often be detached and extracted, the\r\nmouth of that organ having been first dilated by sponge tents or otherwise.\r\nThe rubber dilator (impregnator), sometimes helpful in the mare, is rarely\r\navailable for the cow, owing to the different condition of the mouth of the\r\nwomb.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIMINUTION OR LOSS OF VENEREAL DESIRE (ANAPHRODISIA).\r\n\r\nThis occurs in either sex from low condition and ill health. Longstanding,\r\nchronic diseases of important internal organs, leading to emaciation and\r\nweakness, or a prolonged semistarvation in winter may be sufficient cause.\r\nIt is, however, much more common as the result of degeneration or extensive\r\nand destructive disease of the secreting organs (testicles, ovaries) which\r\nelaborate the male and female sexual products, respectively. Such diseases\r\nare, therefore, a common cause of sterility in both sexes. The old bull,\r\nfat and lazy, becomes sluggish and unreliable in serving, and finally gets\r\nto be useless for breeding purposes. This is not attributable to his weight\r\nand clumsiness alone, but largely to the fatty degeneration of his\r\ntesticles and their excretory ducts, which prevents the due formation and\r\nmaturation of the semen. If he has been kept in extra high condition for\r\nexhibition in the show ring, this disqualification comes upon him sooner\r\nand becomes more irremediable.\r\n\r\nSimilarly the overfed, inactive cow, and above all the show cow, fails to\r\ncome in heat at the usual times, shows little disposition to take the bull,\r\nand fails to conceive when served. Her trouble is the same in kind, namely,\r\nfatty degeneration of the ovaries and of their excretory ducts (Fallopian\r\ntubes), which prevents the formation or maturation of the ovum or, when it\r\nhas formed, hinders its passage into the womb. Another common defect in\r\nsuch old, fat cows is a rigid closure of the mouth of the womb, which\r\nprevents conception, even if the ovum reaches the interior of that organ\r\nand even if the semen is discharged into the vagina.\r\n\r\n_Preventive._--The true preventive of such conditions is to be found in a\r\nsound hygiene. The breeding animal should be of adult age, neither overfed\r\nnor underfed, but well fed and moderately exercised; in other words, the\r\nmost vigorous health should be sought, not only that a strong race may be\r\npropagated, but that the whole herd, or nearly so, may breed with\r\ncertainty. Fleming gives 79 per cent as the general average of cows that\r\nare found to breed in one year. Here more than a fifth of the progeny is\r\nsacrificed and a fifth of the product of the dairy. With careful management\r\nthe proportion of breeders should approach 100 per cent. The various local\r\nand general obstacles to conception should be carefully investigated and\r\nremoved. The vigorous health which comes from a sufficiently liberal diet\r\nand abundant exercise should be solicited, and the comparative\r\nbloodlessness and weakness which advance with undue fattening should be\r\nsedulously avoided. In bull or cow which is becoming unduly fat and showing\r\nindications of sexual indifference, the treatment must be active. Turning\r\nout on a short pasture where it must work hard for a living will often\r\nsuffice. The bull which can not be turned out to pasture may sometimes be\r\nutilized in the yoke or tread power, or he may be kept a part of his time\r\nin a field or paddock chained by the ring in his nose to a strong wire\r\nextending from one side of the lot to the other and attached securely to\r\ntwo trees or posts. The wire should be higher than the back of the bull,\r\nwhich will move frequently from end to end. If he is indisposed to take\r\nsufficient exercise in this way he may be safely driven. An instance of the\r\nvalue of the exercise in these incipient cases of fatty degeneration is\r\noften quoted. The cow Dodona, condemned as barren at Earl Spencer's, was\r\nsold cheap to Jonas Webb, who had her driven by a road a distance of 120\r\nmiles to his farm at Wilbraham, soon after which she became pregnant. In\r\nadvanced cases, however, in which the fatty degeneration is complete,\r\nrecovery is impossible.\r\n\r\nIn case of rigid closure of the mouth of the womb the only resort is\r\ndilatation. This is far more difficult and uncertain in the cow than in the\r\nmare. The neck of the womb is longer, is often tortuous in its course, and\r\nits walls so approximated to each other and so rigid that it may be all but\r\nimpossible to follow it, and there is always danger of perforating its\r\nwalls and opening into the cavity of the abdomen, or, short of that, of\r\ncausing inflammation and a new, rigid, fibrous formation which on healing\r\nleaves matters worse than before. The opening must be carefully made with\r\nthe finger, and when that has entered the womb further dilatation may be\r\neffected by inserting a sponge tent or by careful stretching with a\r\nmechanical dilator. (Pl. XX, fig. 6.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTERILITY FROM OTHER CAUSES.\r\n\r\nThe questions as to whether a bull is a sure stock getter and whether a cow\r\nis a breeder are so important that it would be wrong to pass over other\r\nprominent causes of sterility. Breeding at too early an age is a common\r\nsource of increasing weakness of constitution which has existed in certain\r\nbreeds. Jerseys have especially been made the victims of this mistake, the\r\nobject being to establish the highest milking powers in the smallest\r\nobtainable body which will demand the least material and outlay for its\r\nconstant repair of waste. With success in this line there has been the\r\ncounterbalancing disadvantage of impaired vigor, with too often lessened\r\nfertility as well as increased predisposition to disease. When the heifers\r\nof the race have for generation after generation been bred under a year\r\nold, the demand for the nourishment of the fetus is too great a drain on\r\nthe immature animal, which accordingly remains small and stunted. As it\r\nfails to develop in size, so every organ fails to be nourished to\r\nperfection. Similarly with the immature bull put to too many cows; he fails\r\nto develop his full size, vigor, or stamina, and transfers his acquired\r\nweakness to his progeny. An increasing number of barren females and an\r\nincreasing proclivity to abortions are the necessary results of both\r\ncourses. When this early breeding has occurred accidentally it is well to\r\ndry up the dam just after calving, and to avoid having her served again\r\nuntil full grown.\r\n\r\nSome highly fed and plethoric females seem to escape conception by the very\r\nintensity of the generative ardor. The frequent passage of urine,\r\naccompanied by contractions of the womb and vagina and a profuse secretion\r\nfrom their surfaces, leads to the expulsion of the semen after it has been\r\nlodged in the genital passages. This may be remedied somewhat by giving\r\n1-1/2 pounds of Epsom salt a day or two before she comes in heat, and\r\nsubjecting her at the same time to a spare diet. Should the excessive ardor\r\nof the cow not be controllable in this way, she may be shut up for a day or\r\ntwo, until the heat is passing off, when under the lessened excitement the\r\nsemen is more likely to be retained.\r\n\r\nThe various diseases of the ovaries, their tubes, the womb, the testicles\r\nand their excretory ducts, as referred to under \"Excess of venereal\r\ndesire,\" are causes of barrenness. In this connection it may be said that\r\nthe discharges consequent on calving are fatal to the vitality of semen\r\nintroduced before these have ceased to flow; hence service too soon after\r\ncalving, or that of a cow which has had the womb or genital passages\r\ninjured so as to keep up a mucopurulent flow until the animal comes in\r\nheat, is liable to fail of conception. Any such discharge should be first\r\narrested by repeated injections as for leucorrhea, after which the male may\r\nbe admitted.\r\n\r\nFeeding on a very saccharine diet, which greatly favors the deposition of\r\nfat, seems to have an even more direct effect in preventing conception\r\nduring such regimen. Among other causes of barrenness are all those that\r\nfavor abortion, ergoted grasses, smutty wheat or corn, laxative or diuretic\r\ndrinking water, and any improper or musty feed that causes indigestions,\r\ncolics, and diseases of the urinary organs, notably gravel; also savin,\r\nrue, cantharides, and all other irritants of the bowels or kidneys.\r\n\r\nHermaphrodites are barren, of course, as their sexual organs are not\r\ndistinctively either male or female. The heifer born as a twin with a bull\r\nis usually hermaphrodite and barren, but the animals of either sex in which\r\ndevelopment of the organs is arrested before they are fully matured remain\r\nas in the male or female prior to puberty, and are barren. Bulls with both\r\ntesticles retained within the abdomen may go through the form of serving a\r\ncow, but the service is unfruitful; the spermatozoa are not fully\r\nelaborated. So I have examined a heifer with a properly formed but very\r\nsmall womb and an extremely narrow vagina and vulva, the walls of which\r\nwere very muscular, that could never be made to conceive. A post-mortem\r\nexamination would probably have disclosed an imperfectly formed ovary\r\nincapable of bringing ova to maturity.\r\n\r\nA bull and cow that have been too closely inbred in the same line for\r\ngenerations may prove sexually incompatible and unable to generate\r\ntogether, though both are abundantly prolific when coupled with animals of\r\nother strains.\r\n\r\nFinally, a bull may prove unable to get stock, not from any lack of sexual\r\ndevelopment, but from disease of other organs (back, loins, hind limbs),\r\nwhich renders him unable to mount with the energy requisite to the perfect\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION AND INFLAMMATION OF THE TESTICLES (ORCHITIS).\r\n\r\nThis visually results from blows or other direct injuries, but may be the\r\nresult of excessive service or of the formation of some new growth (tumor)\r\nin the gland tissue. The bull moves stiffly, with straddling gait, and the\r\nright or left half of the scrotum in which the affected testicle lies is\r\nswollen, red, and tender, and the gland is drawn up within the sac and\r\ndropped again at frequent intervals. It may be treated by rest; by 1-1/2\r\npounds Epsom salt given in 4 quarts of water; by a restricted diet of some\r\nsucculent feed; by continued fomentations with warm water by means of\r\nsponges or rags sustained by a sling passed around the loins and back\r\nbetween the hind legs. The pain may be allayed by smearing with a solution\r\nof opium or of extract of belladonna. Should a soft point appear,\r\nindicating the formation of matter, it may be opened with a sharp lancet\r\nand the wound treated daily with a solution of a teaspoonful of carbolic\r\nacid in a half pint of water. Usually, however, when the inflammation has\r\nproceeded to this extent, the gland will be ruined for purposes of\r\nprocreation and must be cut out. (See \"Castration,\" p. 299.)\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE SHEATH.\r\n\r\nWhile this may occur in bulls from infection during copulation and from\r\nbruises, blows, and other mechanical injuries, the condition is more common\r\nin the ox in connection with the comparative inactivity of the parts. The\r\nsheath has a very small external opening, the mucous membrane of which is\r\nstudded with sebaceous glands secreting a thick, unctuous matter of a\r\nstrong, heavy odor. Behind this orifice is a distinct pouch, in which this\r\nunctuous matter is liable to accumulate when the penis is habitually drawn\r\nback. Moreover, the sheath has two muscles (protractors) which lengthen it,\r\npassing into it from the region of the navel, and two (retractors) that\r\nshorten it, passing into it from the lower surface of the pelvic bones\r\nabove. (Pl. IX, fig. 2.) The protractors keep the sheath stretched, so that\r\nit habitually covers the penis, while the retractors shorten it up in the\r\nact of service, so that the penis can project to its full extent. In stud\r\nbulls the frequent protrusion of the erect and enlarged penis and the\r\nretraction and dilation of the opening of the sheath serve to empty the\r\npouch and prevent any accumulation of sebaceous matter or urine. In the ox,\r\non the other hand, the undeveloped and inactive penis is usually drawn back\r\nso as to leave the anterior preputial pouch empty, so that the sebaceous\r\nmatter has space to accumulate and is never expelled by the active\r\nretraction of the sheath and protrusion of the erect penis in service.\r\nAgain, the ox rarely protrudes the tip of the penis in urination, the urine\r\nis discharged into the preputial pouch and lodges and decomposes there, so\r\nthat there is a great liability to the precipitation of its earthy salts in\r\nthe form of gravel. The decomposing ammoniacal urine, the gritty crystals\r\nprecipitated from it, and the fetid, rancid, sebaceous matter set up\r\ninflammation in the delicate mucous membrane lining the passage. The\r\nmembrane is thickened, reddened, rendered friable, and ultimately\r\nulcerated, and the now narrowed sheath is blocked by the increasing mass of\r\nsebaceous and urinous material and the decomposing mucus and pus. The penis\r\ncan no longer be protruded, the urine escapes in a small stream through the\r\nnarrowing sheath, and finally the outlet is completely blocked and the\r\nurine distends the back part of the sheath. This will fluctuate on being\r\nhandled, and soon the unhealthy inflammation extends on each side of it,\r\ncausing a thick, doughy, tender swelling under the belly and between the\r\nthighs. The next step in the morbid course is overdistention of the\r\nbladder, with the occurrence of colicky pains, looking at the flanks,\r\nuneasy movements of the hind limbs, raising or twisting of the tail,\r\npulsatory contractions of the urethra under the anus, and finally a false\r\nappearance of relief, which is caused by rupture of the bladder. Before\r\nrupture takes place the distended bladder may press on the rectum and\r\nobstruct the passage of the bowel dejections. Two mistakes are therefore\r\nprobable--first, that the bowels alone are to be relieved, and, second,\r\nthat the trouble is obstruction of the urethra by a stone. Hence the need\r\nof examining the sheath and pushing the finger into its opening to see that\r\nthere is no obstruction there, in all cases of retention of urine,\r\noverdistended bladder, or blocked rectum in the ox. The disease may be\r\nacute or chronic--the first by reason of acute, adhesive inflammation\r\nblocking the outlet, the second by gradual thickening and ulceration of the\r\nsheath and blocking by the sebaceous and calculous accretion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of this affection depends on the stage. If\r\nrecent and without instant danger of rupture of the bladder, the narrow\r\nopening of the sheath should be freely cut open in the median line below,\r\nand the sac emptied out with a finger or spoon, after which it should be\r\nthoroughly washed with tepid water. To make the cleansing more thorough a\r\ncatheter or a small, rubber tube may be inserted well back into the sheath,\r\nand water may be forced through it from a syringe or a funnel inserted into\r\nthe other end of the tube and considerably elevated. A fountain syringe,\r\nwhich should be in every house, answers admirably. The sheath may be daily\r\nwashed out with tepid water, with a suds made with Castile soap, or with a\r\nweak solution of sulphate of zinc (one-half dram to a quart of water). If\r\nthese attentions are impossible, most cases, after cleansing, will do well\r\nif merely driven through clean water up to the belly once a day.\r\n\r\nIn case the disease has progressed to absolute obstruction, with the\r\nbladder ready to rupture any moment, no time must be lost in opening into\r\nthe urethra with a sharp knife over the bony arch under the anus, where the\r\npulsations are seen in urinating. This incision is best made in the median\r\nline from above downward, but in the absence of a skillful operator a\r\ntransverse incision with a sharp knife over the bone in the median line\r\nuntil the urine flows with a gush is better than to let the patient die.\r\nConsiderable blood will be lost and the wound will heal tardily, but the ox\r\nwill be preserved. Then the slitting and cleansing of the sheath can be\r\ndone at leisure, as described above. If the bladder is ruptured, the case\r\nis hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE SHEATH AND PENIS FROM BRUISING.\r\n\r\nThis also is an affection of work oxen, caused by the pressure and friction\r\nof the sling when the animals are held in stocks for shoeing. This crushing\r\nof both sheath and penis for half an hour or more leads to the development,\r\nsome hours later, of a hard, hot, and painful swelling, extending from the\r\nscrotum as far as the opening of the sheath. Fever sets in, with dry\r\nmuzzle, red eyes, hard, full, rapid pulse, accelerated breathing, and\r\nelevated temperature. The ox stands obstinately with his hind legs drawn\r\napart and urine falling drop by drop from the sheath. Appetite and\r\nrumination are suspended. In twenty-four hours there may be indications of\r\nadvancing gangrene (mortification), the swelling becomes cold, soft, and\r\ndoughy; it may even crack slightly from the presence of gas; a reddish\r\nbrown, fetid liquid oozes from the swelling, especially around the edges,\r\nand if the animal survives it is only with a great loss of substance of the\r\nsheath and penis.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The prevention of such an injury is easy. It is only\r\nnecessary to see that the slings do not press upon the posterior part of\r\nthe abdomen. They must be kept in front of the sheath.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment, to be effective, must be prompt and judicious. Put\r\naround the patient a strap with soft pads in contact with the affected\r\nparts, constantly soaked in cold water for at least 24 hours. A pound or\r\ntwo of Epsom salt in 4 quarts of hot water should also be given. The second\r\nday the parts may be washed with 1 quart of witch-hazel (extract), 2 drams\r\nsugar of lead, and 1 ounce laudanum, or the cold-water irrigations may be\r\ncontinued if the active inflammation persists. In case the swelling\r\ncontinues hard and resistant, it may be pricked at the most prominent\r\npoints to the depth of one-third of an inch with a lancet first dipped in\r\ndilute carbolic acid, and the whole surface should be washed frequently\r\nwith some antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nWhen softening occurs in the center of a hard mass and fluctuation can be\r\nfelt between two fingers pressed on different parts of such softening, it\r\nshould be freely opened to let out the putrid pus, and the cavity should be\r\nsyringed often with antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nIn bad cases extensive sloughs of dead skin, of the whole wall of the\r\nsheath, and even of the penis, may take place, which will require careful\r\nantiseptic treatment. The soaking of the urine into the inflamed and\r\nsoftened tissue and the setting up of putrefactive action not only endanger\r\ngreat destruction of the tissues from putrid inflammation, but even\r\nthreaten life itself from a general blood poisoning (septicemia). Every\r\ncase should have skillful treatment to meet its various phases, but in the\r\nsevere ones this is most urgently demanded.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE URETHRA.\r\n\r\nLike other males, the bull sometimes suffers from inflammation of the canal\r\nwhich conveys the urine through the penis, and a whitish mucopurulent\r\ndischarge forms in consequence. It may have originated in gravel, the\r\nexcitement of too frequent service, infection from a cow with leucorrhea,\r\nor from extension of inflammation from the sheath. Besides the oozing of\r\nthe whitish liquid from the end of the penis and sheath, there is\r\ntenderness and pain when handled, and while there is no actual arrest of\r\nthe urine, its flow is subject to frequent voluntary checks, as the\r\nscalding liquid irritates the tender surface.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If recognized before the discharge sets in, a dose of 1-1/2\r\npounds of Epsom salt and local, warm fomentations would be appropriate.\r\nAfter the onset of the whitish discharge a daily injection of a solution of\r\n20 grains of permanganate of potassium in a pint of water into the penis\r\nwill be beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS AND PAPILLARY GROWTHS ON THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nThese are not frequent in bull or ox. They may interfere with the\r\nprotrusion of the organ from its sheath or with service, and always give\r\nrise to a bad-smelling discharge.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--They may be twisted off with a pair of small tweezers or cut\r\noff with a pair of scissors, and the seat burned with a pencil of lunar\r\ncaustic. To get hold of the penis in the bull, bring him up to a cow. In\r\nthe ox it will be necessary to push it out by manipulation through the\r\nsheath. In difficult cases the narrow opening of the sheath may be slit\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nThe most common wounds are those sustained by blows of horns, sticks, etc.\r\nThe blood vessels and sacs are ruptured to a greater or less extent and\r\nconsiderable swellings filled with coagulated blood and inflammatory\r\nproducts occur, leading to distortion of the organ, and it may be to the\r\nimpossibility of protruding it.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A lotion of a dram of alum in a quart of water may be applied\r\n(injected into the sheath, if necessary), and a large sponge constantly\r\nirrigated by a stream of cold water may be kept applied by means of a\r\nsurcingle to the outer side of the sheath. Incisions are rarely applicable\r\nto an organ of this kind, but in case of the existence of an extensive clot\r\nwhich is unlikely to be absorbed the lancet may be resorted to. If the\r\ninjury leads to paralysis of the penis and hanging out of its sheath, it\r\nshould be supported in a sling and astringents used freely until\r\ninflammation subsides. Then the restoration of power may be sought by a\r\nblister between the thighs, by the use of electricity, or by the careful\r\nuse of nerve stimulants, such as strychnin, 1 grain twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERS ON THE PENIS.\r\n\r\nSores on the penis of the bull may result from gravel or sebaceous masses\r\nin the sheath or from having served a cow having leucorrhea.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--These may be treated by frequent injections into the sheath\r\nof a lotion made with 1 dram sugar of lead, 60 drops carbolic acid, and 1\r\nquart water.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPUS OF THE VAGINA OR UTERUS.\r\n\r\nA polypus is a tumor growing from the mucous membrane, and often connected\r\nto it by a narrow neck. A definite cause can not always be assigned. If\r\ngrowing in the vagina, a polypus may project as a reddish, rounded tumor\r\nfrom the vulva, especially during the act of passing water. It can be\r\ndistinguished from descent of the womb by the absence of the orifice of\r\nthat cavity, which can be felt by the oiled hand beyond the tumor in the\r\ndepth of the vagina. From a vaginal hernia caused by the protrusion of some\r\nabdominal organ enveloped by the relaxed wall of the vagina it may be\r\ndistinguished by its persistence, its firm substance, and the impossibility\r\nof returning it into the abdomen by pressure. A hernia containing a portion\r\nof bowel gurgles when handled and can be completely effaced by pressure,\r\nthe gut passing into the abdomen.\r\n\r\nA polypus in the womb is less easily recognized. At the time of calving it\r\nmay be felt through the open mouth of the womb and recognized by the\r\neducated touch (it must be carefully distinguished from the mushroom-formed\r\ncotyledons (Pl. XIII, fig. 2), to which in ruminants the fetal membranes\r\nare attached). At other times, unless the womb is opened in the effort to\r\nexpel it, the polypus can be detected only by examining the womb with the\r\noiled hand introduced through the rectum.\r\n\r\nPolypi may cause a mucopurulent discharge or they may only be suspected\r\nwhen they prove an obstacle to parturition. The best way to remove them is\r\nto put the chain of an Ècraseur around the neck, or pedicle, of the tumor\r\nand tear it through; or the narrow neck may be torn through by the\r\nemasculator, or in an emergency it may be twisted through by rotating the\r\ntumor on its axis. The removal of the tumor will allow calving to proceed;\r\nafter this the sore may be treated by a daily injection of one-half dram\r\nsulphate of zinc, 1 dram carbolic acid, and 1 quart milk-warm water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nIf a cow remains for three or four weeks after service without showing\r\nsigns of heat (bulling), she is probably pregnant. There are very\r\nexceptional cases in which the well-fed cow will accept the bull weeks or\r\nmonths after actual conception, and others equally exceptional in which the\r\nwell-thriven but unimpregnated female will refuse the male persistently,\r\nbut these in no way invalidate the general rule.\r\n\r\nThe bull, no matter how vigorous or how ardent his sexual instinct, can not\r\nbe made to pay any attention to a cow which is not in heat; hence\r\nindications of pregnancy can be had from both the male and female side.\r\nWhen she has conceived, the cow usually becomes more quiet and docile, and\r\nlays on flesh and fat more rapidly, especially during the first four months\r\nof gestation. The stimulus to digestion and nutrition created by the\r\ndemands of the growing fetus, added to the quieter and more uneventful\r\nlife, contributes to this result. Some feeders avail themselves of this\r\ndisposition to prepare heifers and cows speedily for the butcher.\r\n\r\nThe enlargement of the abdomen, and its dropping so that it bulges below\r\nand to each side, while it falls in at the flank, between the outer angle\r\nof the hip bone and the last rib, are significant features which, though\r\nthey may be caused by abdominal tumor or dropsy, are usually marks of\r\npregnancy. From the same increasing weight of the abdomen the spine in the\r\nregion of the loins sinks so that the bones of the croup seem to rise,\r\nespecially back toward the root of the tail. In the early stages of\r\npregnancy the udder develops slowly, and toward its completion quite\r\nrapidly. For a long time there is merely a sense of greater fullness when\r\nhandled; the wrinkles in the skin become shallower and are effaced, and the\r\nteats are materially enlarged. Beginning a few weeks after conception, this\r\ntends to a steady development, though slight alternations in the sense of\r\nsuccessive growth and shrinkage are not uncommon. In milking cows this does\r\nnot hold, as the milk usually tends to a steady diminution and the udder\r\nshrinks slowly until near the completion of the period, when it undergoes\r\nits sudden, remarkable development, and yields at first a serous liquid and\r\nthen the yellow colostrum, which coagulates when heated. As pregnancy\r\nadvances the mucous membrane lining the vulva becomes swollen and of a\r\ndarker, bluish-red hue; the mucous secretion also increases, becoming very\r\nabundant just before calving. When the feeding has not been altered or\r\nrestricted, a steady diminution of the salts of lime excreted in the urine\r\nis an attendant on pregnancy, the lime being demanded for the growing body\r\nof the fetus.\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth month the movements of the calf may often be observed in\r\nthe right flank, nearly in front of the stifle, when the cow is drinking\r\ncold water. The sensation of cold on the side of the first stomach, which\r\nlies to the left and directly below the womb (Pl. I), stimulates the calf\r\nto active movements, which are detected on the sudden jerking outward of\r\nthe abdominal wall as if from blows delivered from within. In a loose,\r\npendent abdomen in the latter months of gestation the skin may often be\r\nseen pushed out at a sharp angle, irrespective of the period of drinking.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of examination through the flank is by touch. The palm of the\r\nhand is pressed strongly inward, about 8 inches in front of the stifle and\r\na little below, several times in succession, and is then brought to rest\r\nwith the pressure maintained. Presently there are felt distinct and\r\ncharacteristic movements of the fetus, which has been disturbed and roused\r\nto action. Another mode is to press the closed fist strongly inward in the\r\nsame situation and hold it so, forming a deep indentation in the abdominal\r\nwall. Presently the knuckles are felt to be struck by a solid body, which\r\nis no other than the fetus that has been displaced to the left by the push\r\nof the hand, and now floats back in its liquid covering (amniotic fluid;\r\nsee Pl. XII) downward and to the right.\r\n\r\nOf all the modes of examination by touch, that done through the rectum\r\ngives the earliest satisfactory indications. The hand and arm, well oiled,\r\nare introduced, and the excrement having been removed if necessary, the\r\npalm of the hand is turned downward and the floor of the pelvis carefully\r\nexamined. There will be felt in the median line the pear-shaped outline of\r\nthe bladder, more or less full, rounded or tense, according to the quantity\r\nof urine it contains. Between this and the hand will be felt a soft,\r\nsomewhat rounded tubular body, which divides in front into two smaller\r\ntubes or branches, extending to the right and left into the abdomen. This\r\nis the womb, which in its virgin, or unimpregnated, condition is of nearly\r\nuniform size from before backward, the main part or body being from 1-1/2\r\nto 2 inches across, and the two anterior branches or horns being\r\nindividually little over an inch wide. Immediately after conception the\r\nbody and one of the horns begin to enlarge, the vacant horn remaining\r\ndisproportionately small, and the enlargement will be most marked at one\r\npoint, where a solid, rounded mass indicates the presence of the growing\r\nembryo. In case of twins, both horns are enlarged. At a more advanced\r\nstage, when the embryo begins to assume the form of the future animal, the\r\nrounded form gives place to a more or less irregular nodular mass, while\r\nlater still the head, limbs, and body of the fetus may be distinctly made\r\nout. The chief source of fallacy is found in the very pendent abdomen of\r\ncertain cows, into which in advanced gestation the fetus has dropped so low\r\nthat it can not be felt by the hand in the rectum. The absence of the\r\ndistinct outline of the vacant womb, however, and the clear indications\r\nobtained on external examination through the right flank will serve to\r\nprevent any mistake. The fetus may still be felt through the rectum if the\r\nabdomen is raised by a sheet passed from side to side beneath it.\r\n\r\nStill another sign is the beating of the fetal heart, which may be heard in\r\nthe latter half of pregnancy when the ear is pressed on the flank in front\r\nof the right stifle or from that downward to the udder. The beats, which\r\nare best heard in the absence of rumbling, are about 120 a minute and\r\neasily distinguished from any bowel sounds by their perfect regularity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDURATION OF PREGNANCY.\r\n\r\nFrom extended statistics it is found that the average duration of pregnancy\r\nin the cow is 285 days. A calf born at the two hundred and fortieth day may\r\nlive, and Dietrichs reported a case of a calf born on the three hundred and\r\nthirty-fifth day, and another was reported by the American Journal of\r\nMedical Science as having been born on the three hundred and thirty-sixth\r\nday. It is the general observation that in most cases of prolonged\r\npregnancies the offspring are males. Lord Spencer found a preponderance of\r\nmales between the two hundred and ninetieth and the three hundredth days,\r\nbut strangely enough all born after the three hundredth day under his\r\nobservation were females. It may be reasonably inferred that while the\r\nprevailing tendency is to carry the males overtime, yet that the smaller\r\nand comparatively much less developed female sometimes fails to stimulate\r\nthe womb to contraction until very far beyond the regular date.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF THE PREGNANT COW.\r\n\r\nAmong domestic animals considerations of hygiene must be made subservient\r\nto profit, and therefore the first consideration is not to obtain the most\r\nrobust health, but such a measure of vigor and stamina as is compatible\r\nwith the most profitable utilization of the animal. The breeding cow must\r\ncarry a calf every year, and this notwithstanding that she is at the same\r\ntime suckling another large, growing calf. The dairy cow must breed every\r\nyear, and at the same time must furnish a generous flow of milk from nine\r\nto eleven months yearly. If her health is lowered thereby or her life\r\nshortened, the question of profit must still hold sway, and, when\r\ndisqualified, she must yield her place to another. There are exceptions, of\r\ncourse, but this rule generally holds.\r\n\r\nThere are certain points, however, in which the interests of hygiene may be\r\nconsidered. The pregnant cow should have exercise, and as regards both\r\nexercise and feed, nothing is better than a run on a smooth pasture. She\r\nshould be withheld from all violent excitement, hunting with dogs, riding\r\nor being ridden by cows in heat, driving in herd rapidly through narrow\r\ngateways, causing to jump ditches or fences, subjecting to blows with the\r\nhorns of pugnacious cattle, driving on icy or otherwise slippery ground,\r\ncarrying in railroad cars, kicking by vicious attendants, and fastening or\r\nthrowing down for operations. The diet should be good, not of a kind to\r\nfatten, but with a generous quantity of nitrogenous constituents which will\r\nfavor both the yield of milk and the nourishment of the fetus. Aliments\r\nlike wheat bran, middlings, etc., which are rich in lime and phosphates,\r\ncan be used to advantage, as there is a constant drain of earthy salts for\r\nthe building of the body of the calf, and thereby the danger of undue\r\nconcentration of the urine is lessened. Hard, innutritious, and\r\nindigestible aliments, musty grain or hay, partially ripened rye grass,\r\nmillet, Hungarian grass, vetches, peas, or maize are objectionable, as they\r\nare liable to cause indigestion or even paralysis; and corn or hay affected\r\nby smut or ergot, or that has been spoiled by wet, overripened, and\r\nrendered fibrous and innutritious, is equally objectionable. In the main\r\nthe feed should be laxative, as costiveness and straining are liable to\r\ncause abortion. Roots and green feed that have been frosted are\r\nobjectionable, as being liable to cause indigestion, though in their fresh\r\ncondition most wholesome and desirable. Ice-cold water should be avoided,\r\nas calculated to check the flow of milk, to derange digestion, and to cause\r\nabortion. A good temperature for the drink of the dairy cow is 55∞ F.\r\n\r\nIn the case of plethoric and heavy-milking cows of mature age and in the\r\nprime of life, the hitherto liberal diet must be changed at the last week\r\nfor the scantiest possible fare, and the bowels must be kept open by\r\nlaxatives, if need be, if the owner would avoid milk fever. Her stall\r\nshould not incline downward from shoulder to croup, lest the pressure of\r\nthe abdominal organs should produce protrusion or abortion. She should be\r\nkept aloof from all causes of acute diseases, and all existing diseases\r\nshould be remedied speedily and with as little excitement of the abdominal\r\norgans as possible. Strong purgatives and diuretics are to be especially\r\navoided, unless it is in the very last days of gestation in very plethoric\r\ncows.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTRUSION OF THE VAGINA (PROLAPSUS VAGIN∆).\r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy this is common from chronic relaxation of the vaginal\r\nwalls and from lying in stalls that are lower behind than in front. The\r\nprotrusion is of a rounded form and smooth, and if it embraces both sides\r\nof the canal it is double, with a passage between. It may sometimes be\r\nremedied by raising the hind part of the stall higher than the front part.\r\nThis failing, a truss may be applied as for eversion of the womb, and worn\r\nuntil the period of calving approaches. (Pls. XXII, XXIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHERNIA (BREACH) OF THE UTERUS.\r\n\r\nIn advanced pregnancy this occurs usually from a gradual relaxation and\r\ndistention of the lower wall of the abdomen in the region of the udder, so\r\nthat the latter is displaced downward, and in the sac above and in front of\r\nit may be felt the form and movements of the fetus. In other cases the womb\r\nescapes through a great laceration of the abdominal muscles to one side of\r\nthe udder, and the hernial mass extends down to one side of that organ.\r\nHowever unsightly, this often allows the animal to complete its pregnancy\r\nnaturally, and a broad, supporting bandage placed around the abdomen is\r\nabout all that can be recommended. After calving it is best to fatten the\r\ncow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAMPS OF THE HIND LIMBS.\r\n\r\nThe compression of the nerves by the womb and fetus passing through the\r\npelvis sometimes causes cramp and inability to move the limb, but it\r\ndisappears under friction and motion and is never seen after calving.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE HIND LIMBS AND BETWEEN THE THIGHS.\r\n\r\nIn the latter months of pregnancy the hind legs may swell beneath the\r\nhocks, or a soft swelling which pits on pressure with the finger appears\r\nfrom the vulva down between the thighs to the udder and in front. It is\r\nmainly ascribable to the pressure of the enlarged womb on the blood\r\nvessels, is not dangerous, and disappears after calving.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE MEMBRANES OF THE FETUS (DROPSY OF THE WOMB).\r\n\r\nThe unimpregnated womb may be filled with a dropsical fluid, but the\r\npregnant womb is more liable to become overdistended by an excess of fluid\r\nin the inner water bag in which the fetus floats. (Pl. XII.) From an\r\nunhealthy state of this membrane or of blood of the fetus (water blood)\r\nthis liquid may go on accumulating until the cow seems almost as broad as\r\nshe is long. If the trouble has not originated in the ill health of the\r\ncow, the result is still to draw on her system, overtax her strength, and\r\nderange her digestion, so that the result may prove fatal to both mother\r\nand offspring. On the other hand, I have known extreme cases that came to\r\nthe natural term without help and produced a living calf, after which the\r\ndam did well. The natural resort is to draw off a portion of the fluid\r\nthrough a hollow needle passed through the neck of the womb or through its\r\ntense wall adjacent. This may be repeated several times, as demanded, to\r\nrelieve the cow from the injurious distention.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARALYSIS OF THE HIND PARTS.\r\n\r\nIn ill-fed, weak, unthrifty cows palsy of the hind limbs and tail may\r\nappear in the last weeks of pregnancy. The anus and rectum may participate\r\nin the palsy so far as to prevent defecation, and the rectum is more or\r\nless completely impacted. Exposure to wet and cold are often accessory\r\ncauses, though the low condition, general weakness, and the pressure on the\r\nnerves going to the hind limbs are not to be forgotten. Something may be\r\ndone for these cases by a warm, dry bed, an abundant diet fed warm,\r\nfrictions with straw wisps or with a liniment of equal parts of oil of\r\nturpentine and sweet oil on the loins, croup, and limbs, by the daily use\r\nof ginger and gentian, by the cautious administration of strychnia (1 grain\r\ntwice daily), and by sending a current of electricity daily from the loins\r\nthrough the various groups of muscles in the hind limbs. The case becomes\r\nincreasingly hopeful after calving, though some days may still elapse\r\nbefore the animal can support herself upon her limbs.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRAUTERINE GESTATION (FETUS DEVELOPING OUTSIDE THE WOMB).\r\n\r\nThese curious cases are rare and are usually divided into three types: (1)\r\nThat in which the fetus is formed in or on the ovary (ovarian gestation);\r\n(2) that in which it is lodged in the Fallopian tube, or canal between the\r\novary and womb (tubal gestation); and (3) that in which it is lodged in the\r\nabdominal cavity and attached to one or more of its contents from which it\r\ndraws its nourishment (abdominal gestation). Undoubted cases of the first\r\nand last varieties are recorded as occurring in the cow. The explanation of\r\nsuch cases is to be found in the fact that the actively moving sperm cells\r\n(spermatozoa) thrown into the womb have made their way through the\r\nFallopian tubes to the ovary. If they met and impregnated an ovum in the\r\ntube, and if the consequent growth of that ovum prevented its descent and\r\ncaused its imprisonment within the tube, it developed there, getting\r\nattached to and drawing nourishment from the mucous walls. Such product has\r\nits development arrested by compression by the undilatable tube, or,\r\nbursting through the walls of the tube, it escapes into the abdomen and\r\nperishes. If, on the contrary, the spermatozoa only meet and impregnate the\r\novum on or in the ovary, the development may take place in the substance of\r\nthe ovary, from which the fetus draws its nourishment, or the impregnated\r\novum, escaping between the ovary and the open end of the tube, falls into\r\nthe abdominal cavity and becomes adherent to and draws nourishment from\r\nsome of the abdominal organs (womb, bowel, liver, stomach, etc.).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are those of pregnancy, which may be suddenly\r\ncomplicated by inflammation (peritonitis), owing to rupture of the sac\r\ncontaining the fetus; or at full term signs of calving appear, but no\r\nprogress is made; an examination with the oiled hand in the vagina or\r\nrectum finds the womb empty and its mouth closed. Further examination will\r\ndisclose the fetal sac attached in some part of the abdominal cavity and\r\ncontaining the more or less perfectly developed body of a calf. In the most\r\nhopeful cases the fetus perishes at an early stage of gestation, becomes\r\ninclosed in a fibrous sac, and is slowly absorbed, its soft parts becoming\r\nliquefied and removed and the bones remaining encysted. In some cases the\r\nbones have finally sloughed into the rectum or through an artificial\r\nopening in the side of the belly.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Little can be done in such cases except to quiet pain and\r\nexcitement by anodynes (opium, chloral, etc.) and leave the rest to nature.\r\nA fistula discharging bones may be dilated and the bones extracted, the sac\r\nbeing then washed out with a solution of 10 grains bichlorid of mercury in\r\na quart of water. In certain cases with a live calf a skillful operator may\r\nbe justified in cutting into the abdomen and extracting the calf with its\r\nmembranes, using the lotion just named as an antiseptic.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLONGED RETENTION OF THE FETUS.\r\n\r\nEven when the fetus has developed within the womb it may fail to be\r\ndelivered at the proper time; labor pains have quickly subsided and the cow\r\nresumed her usual health. In such cases the calf dies, and its soft parts\r\nare gradually liquefied and absorbed, while its bones remain for years in\r\nthe womb inclosed in the remains of the fetal membranes. These may be\r\nexpelled at any time through the natural channels, or they may remain\r\nindefinitely in the womb, not interfering with the general health, but\r\npreventing conception.\r\n\r\nIf the true condition of things is recognized at the time of the subsidence\r\nof the labor pains, the mouth of the womb may be dilated by the fingers, by\r\nthe insertion of sponge tents, or by a mechanical dilator (Pl. XX, fig. 6),\r\nthe fetal membranes may be ruptured and the calf extracted. After the\r\nremoval of the calf and its membranes the danger of putrid poisoning may be\r\nobviated by injecting the antiseptic solution advised in the paragraph\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nABORTION (SLINKING THE CALF).\r\n\r\nTechnically, abortion is the term used for the expulsion of the offspring\r\nbefore it can live out of the womb. Its expulsion before the normal time,\r\nbut after it is capable of an independent existence, is premature\r\nparturition. In the cow this may be after seven and one-half months of\r\npregnancy. Earl Spencer failed to raise any calf born before the two\r\nhundred and forty-second day. Dairymen use the term abortion for the\r\nexpulsion of the product of conception at any time before the completion of\r\nthe full period of a normal pregnancy, and in this sense it will be used in\r\nthis article.\r\n\r\nAbortion in cows is either contagious or noncontagious. It does not follow\r\nthat the contagium is the sole cause in every case in which it is present.\r\nWe know that the organized germs (microbes) of contagion vary much in\r\npotency at different times, and that the animal system also varies in\r\nsusceptibility to their attack. The germ may therefore be present in a herd\r\nwithout any manifest injury, its disease-producing power having for the\r\ntime abated considerably, or the whole herd being in a condition of\r\ncomparative insusceptibility. At other times the same germ may have become\r\nso virulent that almost all pregnant cows succumb to its force, or the herd\r\nmay have been subjected to other causes of abortion which, though of\r\nthemselves powerless to actually cause abortion, may yet so predispose the\r\nanimals that even the weaker germ will operate with destructive effect. In\r\ndealing with this disease, therefore, it is the part of wisdom not to rest\r\nsatisfied with the discovery and removal of one specific cause, but rather\r\nto try to find every existent cause and to obtain a remedy by correcting\r\nall the harmful conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNONCONTAGIOUS ABORTION.\r\n\r\nAs abortion most frequently occurs at those three-week intervals at which\r\nthe cow would have been in heat if nonpregnant, we may assume a\r\npredisposition at such times owing to a periodicity in the nervous system\r\nand functions. Poor condition, weakness, and a too watery state of the\r\nblood is often a predisposing cause. This in its turn may result from poor\r\nor insufficient feed, from the excessive drain upon the udder while bearing\r\nthe calf, from the use of feed deficient in certain essential elements,\r\nlike the nitrogenous constituents or albuminoids, from chronic, wasting\r\ndiseases, from roundworms or tapeworms in the bowels, from flat-worms\r\n(flukes, trematodes) in the liver, from worms in the lungs, from dark,\r\ndamp, unhealthful buildings, etc. In some such cases the nourishment is so\r\ndeficient that the fetus dies in the womb and is expelled in consequence.\r\nExcessive loss of blood, attended as it usually is with shock, becomes a\r\ndirect cause of abortion.\r\n\r\nAcute inflammations of important organs are notorious causes of abortion,\r\nand in most contagious fevers (lung plague, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease) it is a common result. Affections of the chest which prevent due\r\naeration of the blood induce contractions of the womb, as shown\r\nexperimentally by Brown-Sequard. Pregnant women suffocated in smoke aborted\r\nin many cases. (Retoul.)\r\n\r\nErgoted grasses have long been known as a cause of widespread abortion in\r\ncows. The ergot is familiar as the dark purple or black, hard, spurlike\r\ngrowths which protrude from the seeds of the grasses at the period of their\r\nripening. (Pl. V.) It is especially common, in damp localities and cloudy\r\nseasons on meadows shaded by trees and protected against the free sweep of\r\nthe winds. The same is to a large extent true of smut; hence, wet years\r\nhave been often remarkable for the great prevalence of abortions. Abortions\r\nhave greatly increased in New Zealand among cows since the introduction of\r\nrye grass, which is specially subject to ergot. As abortion is more\r\nprevalent in old dairying districts, the ergot may not be the sole cause in\r\nthis instance.\r\n\r\nThe riding of one another by cows is attended by such severe muscular\r\nexertion, jars, jolts, mental excitement, and gravitation of the womb and\r\nabdominal organs backward that it may easily cause abortion in a\r\npredisposed animal.\r\n\r\nKeeping in stalls that slope too much behind (more than 2 inches) acts in\r\nthe same way, the compression from lying and the gravitation backward\r\nproving more than a predisposed cow can safely bear.\r\n\r\nDeep gutters behind the stalls, into which one or both hind limbs slip\r\nunexpectedly, strain the loins and jar the body and womb most injuriously.\r\nSlippery stalls in which the flooring boards are laid longitudinally in\r\nplace of transversely, and on which there is no device to give a firm\r\nfoothold, are almost equally dangerous. Driving on icy ground, or through a\r\nnarrow doorway where the abdomen is liable to be jammed, are other common\r\ncauses. Aborting cows often fail to expel the afterbirth, and if this\r\nremains hanging in a putrid condition it is most injurious to pregnant cows\r\nin the near vicinity. So with retained afterbirth in other cows after\r\ncalving. That some cows kept in filthy stables or with slaughterhouses near\r\nby may become inured to the odors and escape the evil results is no\r\ndisproof of the injurious effects so often seen in such cases.\r\n\r\nThe excitement, jarring, and jolting of a railroad journey often cause\r\nabortion, especially as the cow nears the period of calving, and the terror\r\nor injury of railway or other accidents proves incomparably worse.\r\n\r\nAll irritant poisons cause abortions by the disorder and inflammation of\r\nthe digestive organs, and if such agents act also on the kidneys or womb,\r\nthe effect is materially enhanced. Powerful purgatives or diuretics should\r\nnever be administered to the pregnant cow.\r\n\r\nAmong other causes of abortion must be named the death or the various\r\nillnesses of the fetus, which are about as numerous as those of the adult;\r\nthe slipping of a young fetus through a loop in the navel string so as to\r\ntie a knot which will tighten later and interrupt the flow of blood with\r\nfatal effect, and the twisting of the navel string by the turning of the\r\nfetus until little or no blood can flow through the contorted cord. There\r\nis in addition a series of diseases of the mucous membrane of the womb, and\r\nof the fetal membranes (inflammation, effusion of blood, detachment of the\r\nmembranes from the womb, fatty or other degenerations, etc.), which\r\ninterfere with the supply of blood to the fetus or change its quality so\r\nthat death is the natural result, followed by abortion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Although the first symptoms of abortion have appeared, it\r\ndoes not follow that it will go on to completion. So long as the fetus has\r\nnot perished, if the waters have not been discharged, nor the water bags\r\npresented, attempts should be made to check its progress. Every appreciable\r\nand removable cause should be done away with, the cow should be placed in a\r\nquiet stall alone, and agents given to check the excitement of the labor\r\npains. Laudanum in doses of 1 ounce for a small cow or 2 ounces for a large\r\none should be promptly administered, and repeated in three or four hours\r\nshould the labor pains recur. This may be kept up for days or even weeks if\r\nnecessary, though that is rarely required, as the trouble either subsides\r\nor abortion occurs. If the laudanum seems to lack permanency of action, use\r\nbromid of potassium, or, better, extract of _Viburnum prunifolium_ (black\r\nhaw), 40 grains, at intervals of two or three hours until five or six doses\r\nhave been given.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS ABORTION.\r\n\r\nContagious abortion (also known as epizootic abortion, enzootic abortion,\r\nand slinking of calves) is a disease affecting chiefly cattle and to a\r\nlesser degree other domestic animals, and characterized by an inflammatory\r\ncondition of the female reproductive organs, which results in the expulsion\r\nof the immature young.\r\n\r\n_History._--This disease has been known in England and continental Europe\r\nfor many years, and descriptions of it are mentioned in the writings of\r\nMascal, Lafoose, Skellet, Lawrence, St. Cyr, Z¸ndel, and Youatt. In the\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century British veterinarians recognized its\r\ncontagiousness, but it remained for Franck (1876), Lehnert (1878), and\r\nBr‰uer (1880) to produce the disease in healthy, pregnant cows by the\r\nintroduction of exudate and material from aborting animals. Nocard (1888)\r\nisolated from the exudate between the mucous membrane of the uterus and\r\nfetal membranes a micrococcus and a short bacillus which were found\r\ncontinually in contagious abortion, but he failed to reproduce the disease\r\nby inoculations of pure cultures of these organisms into healthy, pregnant\r\nanimals. In 1897 Bang, assisted by Stribolt, published their findings\r\nregarding infectious abortion of cattle, in which they incriminated Bang's\r\nbacillus of abortion as the causative agent. With pure cultures of this\r\nbacillus they were able to produce the disease artificially and to recover\r\nthe same organism from the experimental cases. Since that time many noted\r\ninvestigators, both in this country and in Europe, have confirmed these\r\nfindings.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The _Bacterium abortus_ of Bang is now generally recognized as\r\nthe causative agent of the disease of cattle. Formerly it was thought that\r\nabortion was due to injury, such as blows, horn thrusts, falls, etc., or\r\nthe eating of spoiled feed and certain plants, and while this may be true\r\nin a limited number of cases, careful investigations have demonstrated\r\nthese claims to be largely unfounded. It is now generally recognized that\r\nwhen abortion occurs in herds from time to time, it is safe to assume that\r\nthe disorder is of an infectious nature and should be so treated.\r\n\r\n_Natural mode of infection._--This phase of the disease is of greatest\r\nimportance for a clear understanding of the methods of prevention. Many\r\ninvestigators have demonstrated that the infection is transmitted through\r\nthe digestive tract, through contaminated feed and water. The germs are\r\ntaken up by the body from the intestines with the liquid nourishment, reach\r\nthe blood, and are carried to the genital organs, where they find\r\nconditions best suited to their development. Some assert that calves are\r\ninfected in this manner by suckling infected mothers, the germs being\r\npresent in the milk, or the teats having been contaminated by coming in\r\ncontact with infective discharges. It is claimed that infection contracted\r\nin this manner remains dormant in the body of the calf until pregnancy\r\nbegins, and then the organism, finding conditions suitable for its\r\ndevelopment, produces the disease.\r\n\r\nAbortion may occasionally be transmitted from cow to cow by direct contact.\r\nThe discharges from diseased cows, swarming with the germs, soil the\r\nexternal genitals, tail, and hind quarters, and then a susceptible animal,\r\nby contact, gets the infective material upon the vulva, the infection\r\ntraveling up the genital canal and directly infecting the uterus.\r\n\r\nThe belief long entertained that the female acquires the disease at the\r\ntime of copulation as a result of transference of the infection from\r\naffected to healthy females on the genital organs of the bull has failed to\r\nreceive the support of experimental evidence. The view that the disease is\r\nspread to any great degree in this way has been largely discredited. Cows\r\nof all ages are more or less susceptible, but young ones in first or second\r\npregnancy most frequently abort. A second abortion is not unusual, and a\r\nthird may occasionally occur, after which the cow usually becomes immune\r\nand thereafter carries her calf to maturity. Heifers from aborting mothers\r\nsometimes seem to be less susceptible than others.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Contagious abortion is a very insidious disease, developing\r\nvery slowly through several months of the gestation period, and resulting\r\nfinally in the expulsion of the immature young, this act being simply an\r\nindication of the presence of the disease and not the disease itself.\r\nBecause of this slow development and the fact that the health of the animal\r\nis not noticeably influenced, the presence of the disease may not be\r\nsuspected until it has gained a firm foothold in the herd. The symptoms of\r\napproaching abortion are those preceding normal calving. In addition, there\r\nmay be observed, a few days previous to abortion, a sticky, sometimes\r\npurulent, rusty, and odorless discharge. Abortion occurs most frequently\r\nfrom the third to the seventh month, according to the number of abortions,\r\noccurring early in first abortion, and later in each succeeding abortion\r\nuntil the calf is carried to full term and the mother has become immune. It\r\nhappens frequently that calves are carried almost to full term, and are\r\nborn alive, but are sickly, and soon die. Following abortion there is a\r\ndirty, yellowish-gray mucopurulent discharge which persists for two or more\r\nweeks. If abortion occurs early, the fetus is passed surrounded by its\r\nmembranes, but if late in the period of pregnancy, the membranes are\r\nretained, decomposition sets in and blood poisoning, which may cause the\r\ndeath of the animal, or sterility may result.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--The most characteristic change is found in the uterus where a\r\ndark-brown fluid, purulent or even gluey in consistency, and containing\r\ngrayish-white flakes separates the material membranes from those of the\r\nfetus, preventing that intimate contact between the two which is so\r\nnecessary for the interchange of fluids and gases by which the fetus is\r\nnourished and by which it obtains its oxygen. These being cut off, the\r\nfetus must of course die. The germs producing the disease are found in\r\ngreatest numbers at this point. In addition there may be inflammatory\r\nchanges, first in the walls of the uterus and then in the tissues of the\r\nfetus. These inflammatory changes seem most intense in the cotyledons and\r\nresult in the destruction of the minute structure of those bodies, and they\r\nappear swollen, pale, and soft. The membrane of the uterus between the\r\ncotyledons also may show inflamed and necrotic patches.\r\n\r\n_Complications._--Serious results sometimes follow abortion, and this is\r\nparticularly the case when there is retained afterbirth. The retained\r\nmembranes decompose, the poisonous products of decomposition and the\r\norganisms of decomposition themselves are absorbed, blood poisoning\r\nresults, and the animal dies. Sometimes, when the animal is able to resist\r\nthe effects of this decomposition, the uterus becomes the seat of such\r\nsevere changes that sterility results. The walls of that organ become\r\nthickened and hard, the lining membranes become eroded, and conception can\r\nnot take place. At other times the ovaries, where the reproductive cells\r\noriginate, become affected and lose their function. Abortion does not\r\ninvariably follow infection, but the calf is carried to full term. In these\r\ncases, however, retained afterbirth is a common occurrence, even to the\r\nextent that frequent retention of afterbirth in a herd may be taken as an\r\nindication of the presence of the disease. Very often suppurative processes\r\npersist for a long time, preventing conception, or sterility may result\r\nwithout apparent cause. A sterile cow is valueless, of course, for any\r\npurpose except for beef. Such animals are a source of infection for the\r\nothers and should not be allowed to remain in the herd.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The diagnosis of infectious abortion is made from the changes\r\noccurring in the fetal membranes and in the expelled fetus. This, however,\r\nis substantiated with certainty only by microscopic demonstration of the\r\ngerm of abortion. The fact that repeated abortions are observed in a herd\r\nis also evidence of the presence of the disease. In consideration, however,\r\nof the fact that animals may be affected with the disease and disseminate\r\nthe germs, even though they carry the fetus to full time, a diagnosis in\r\nsuch instances is only possible by laboratory methods. For this purpose the\r\nagglutination and also the complement-fixation tests are being used with\r\nsplendid results, and by the aid of these biological tests it is possible\r\nto determine all infected animals in a herd. The tests are carried out with\r\nthe serum from animals to be examined, only a teaspoonful of serum being\r\nnecessary for the execution of both of these tests. It, however, has to be\r\nconfined to laboratories which are properly equipped for such work.\r\n\r\n_Treatment and prevention._--It may be said in general that treatment is\r\nwithout avail and all efforts should be directed toward prevention. Various\r\nmedicinal agents, such as carbolic acid administered subcutaneously and\r\nmethylene blue fed in large quantities, have been recommended, but have\r\nfailed to stand the tests of scientific investigation and practical use.\r\nSerums and vaccines have also been prepared and sold as cures and\r\npreventives, but the work is still considered in the experimental stage.\r\n\r\nBacterial vaccines are at present extensively used in the control of this\r\ndisease, and while numerous reports indicate beneficial results from their\r\nadministration, in other instances total failures have been recorded. It\r\nappears that the experiments in this line have not progressed sufficiently\r\nto justify definite conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe spread of the disease can be controlled to a great degree by the\r\npractice of sanitary measures directed toward the disinfection of premises\r\nand the isolation of animals at time of calving and aborting. For methods\r\nof disinfection of premises see page 363.\r\n\r\nMake frequent observations of the animals of affected herds for symptoms of\r\naborting, such as swelling of vulva or udder enlargement, and upon the\r\ndiscovery of an animal showing these symptoms place her immediately in a\r\nstall which is somewhat remote from healthy stock as a means of confining\r\nthe products of abortion as much as possible should the act occur. If an\r\nanimal aborts unexpectedly she should be removed to separate quarters and\r\ngiven proper attention as promptly as possible. The fetus, afterbirth,\r\nprovided it has been expelled, and all litter that has been contaminated\r\nwith them and uterine discharges should be gathered up and destroyed either\r\nby burning or burying. Clean and thoroughly disinfect the floor, gutters,\r\nand manger in the vicinity of the aborting animal.\r\n\r\nDaily irrigations of the uterus with nonirritating antiseptic solutions,\r\nsuch as 0.5 per cent solution of cresol or compound solution of cresol, at\r\nbody temperature have a tendency to prevent the multiplication of\r\nmicroorganisms in the uterus and in this way promote recovery. Douching of\r\nthe uterus should be continued until the discharge ceases. In addition, the\r\nexternal genitals, root of the tail, escutcheon, etc., should be sponged\r\ndaily with the antiseptic solution.\r\n\r\nAim to place all pregnant animals in disinfected individual pens or stalls\r\na few days before they are expected to calve, and confine them to these\r\nquarters for three or four weeks following the delivery of the calf, or as\r\nlong thereafter as uterine discharges are observed. Avoid carrying\r\ninfection from the maternity stalls to other portions of stable, on shoes\r\nor otherwise. This may be prevented to some degree by the use of\r\ndisinfectant solutions on shoes after the stalls have been entered or by\r\nwearing rubbers while in the maternity stalls, removing them after the\r\nisolated animals have been attended to. The isolation of cows at time of\r\ncalving and the aborting animal is based upon the knowledge that the fetus,\r\nafterbirth, and uterine discharges of an affected animal at these times\r\nvery frequently contain myriads of the abortion bacteria, and that unless\r\nthese substances are confined and promptly destroyed an abundant\r\nopportunity is provided for the contamination of the food substances of the\r\nhealthy animals and their contraction of the disease.\r\n\r\nRefrain from breeding fresh cows for a period of six weeks to two months\r\nfollowing calving. The aborting animal should be isolated for a period of\r\nsix weeks to two months and under no consideration be permitted to mingle\r\nwith the rest of the herd as long as uterine discharges are observed.\r\n\r\nDouching of the external genitals of the bull, a practice formerly regarded\r\nas highly important for preventing the spread of the disease, is now\r\nrecognized as being of doubtful value. The bull is protected from abortion\r\ninfection to a great degree by permitting him to serve only such animals as\r\nhave calved or aborted from six weeks to two months previously.\r\nInvestigational work has indicated that when the bull is affected with the\r\ndisease the organs of his generative system commonly involved are not\r\nreached by the antiseptic solutions. A more rational method for the\r\nprevention of the spread of the disease by the bull consists in keeping him\r\nin an inclosure separate from the females and in having all services take\r\nplace on neutral ground.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be used in purchasing cattle, and cows not known to be\r\nfree from the disease should be kept in separate quarters until this point\r\nis determined.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANULAR VENEREAL DISEASE (INFECTIOUS GRANULAR VAGINITIS).\r\n\r\nThe affection to which the foregoing names have been given is a chronic,\r\nmild, and apparently contagious disease of cattle, characterized by an\r\ninflammatory condition of the mucous membrane of the vagina and the\r\ndevelopment of nodules upon its surface.\r\n\r\nThis disease is very widely spread, but from an economic point of view it\r\ndoes not appear to have great significance. Williams, who investigated it,\r\nasserts that it is difficult to find a single herd in this country which is\r\nfree of this disease. He considers it of great importance, claiming that\r\ngranular vaginitis has a vital relation to abortion. This view, however, is\r\nnot substantiated by other investigators, it being now generally accepted\r\nthat the disease is only rarely responsible for abortion, and further, that\r\nit exerts no apparent ill effects on the health of the animal and that it\r\nhas no effect on the milk yield.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Natural infection may take place either by direct contact of\r\nanimals or at the time of service. Most of the cows in the affected herd\r\ncontract the disease, but the bulls are rarely or very mildly affected. The\r\ninflamed condition of the membranes of the vagina results in a catarrhal\r\nexudate, and this discharge, which soils the external genitals and the\r\ntail, and the uneasiness and sometimes the straining of the animal, are the\r\nfirst and most prominent symptoms observed. Upon examination, small, hard,\r\ngrayish nodules can be seen and felt upon the inflamed membranes. This\r\nacute stage may last for three or four weeks, then it gradually subsides\r\nand assumes the chronic form, only to flare up again as the animal comes in\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nThese nodules are sometimes found on the membranes of the uterus, and some\r\ninvestigators have argued from this fact that it was responsible for\r\nabortion and sterility. Others, however, deny this and point out that the\r\nbacillus of abortion can be demonstrated in nearly every case. The\r\nimportance of the disease is therefore in dispute and the decision must be\r\nleft to future investigation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The exaggerated importance which has been attached to this\r\ndisease resulted in the exploitation of the most varied kinds of remedies\r\nfor its treatment. It is true that with a protracted and laborious\r\ntreatment it is possible to effect cures in from one to three months, but\r\nwith our present knowledge of this disorder it is advisable to limit the\r\ntreatment to animals which show an acute inflammatory condition of the\r\nvagina and vulva with a discharge as a result of the granular affection.\r\nThe treatment should be local and confined to the application of antiseptic\r\nwashes in the form of irrigations. For this purpose a 0.5 per cent solution\r\nof the compound solution of cresol or of Lugol's solution has been found\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTURITION (CALVING).\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF CALVING.\r\n\r\nIn the cow the premonitions of calving are the enlargement of the udder,\r\nwhich becomes firm and resistant to the touch, with more or less swelling\r\nin front, and yields a serous, milky fluid; the enlargement and swelling of\r\nthe vulva, which discharges an abundant, stringy mucus; the drooping of the\r\nbelly, and the falling in of the muscles at each side of the root of the\r\ntail, so as to leave deep hollows. When this last symptom is seen, calving\r\nmay be counted on in 24 hours or in 2 or 3 days. When the act is imminent,\r\nthe cow becomes uneasy, moves restlessly, leaves off eating, in the field\r\nleaves the herd, lies down and rises again as if in pain, shifts upon her\r\nhind feet, moves the tail, and may bellow or moan. When labor pains come on\r\nthe back is arched, the croup drooped, the belly is drawn up, and straining\r\nis more or less violent and continuous. Meanwhile blood may have appeared\r\non the vulva and tail, and soon the clear water bags protrude between the\r\nlips of the vulva. They increase rapidly, hanging down toward the hocks,\r\nand the fore or hind feet can be detected within them. With the rupture of\r\nthe bags and escape of the waters the womb contracts on the solid, angular\r\nbody of the fetus and is at once stimulated to more violent contractions,\r\nso that the work proceeds with redoubled energy to the complete expulsion.\r\nThis is why it is wrong to rupture the water bags if the presentation is\r\nnormal, as they furnish a soft, uniform pressure for the preliminary\r\ndilation of the mouth of the womb and passages, in anticipation of the\r\nsevere strain put upon them as the solid body of the calf passes.\r\n\r\nThe cow often calves standing, in which case the navel string is broken as\r\nthe calf falls to the ground. If, however, she is recumbent, this cord is\r\ntorn through as she rises. The afterpains come on 3 or 4 hours later and\r\nexpel the membranes, which should never be left longer than 24 hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL PRESENTATION.\r\n\r\nWhen there is but one calf the natural presentation is that of the fore\r\nfeet with the front of the hoofs and knees turned upward toward the tail of\r\nthe dam and the nose lying between the knees. (Pl. XV.) If there are twins\r\nthe natural position of the second is that of the hind feet, the heels and\r\nhocks turned upward toward the cow's tail. (Pl. XVIII, fig. 1.) In both of\r\nthese natural positions the curvature of the body of the calf--the back\r\narched upward--is the same with the curvature of the passages, which\r\ndescend anteriorly into the womb, ascend over the brim of the pelvis, and\r\ndescend again toward the external opening (vulva). Any presentation\r\ndiffering from the above is abnormal.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTACLES TO PARTURITION.\r\n\r\nWith a well-formed cow and calf and a natural presentation as above,\r\ncalving is usually prompt and easy. Obstacles may, however, come from\r\nfailure of the mouth of the womb to dilate; from twisting of the neck of\r\nthe womb; from tumors in the vagina; from dropsy in the womb or abdomen;\r\nfrom overdistention of the rectum or bladder; from undue narrowing of the\r\npassages; from excess of fat in the walls of the pelvis; from the\r\ndisturbance of a nervous cow by noises; from stone or urine in the bladder;\r\nfrom wrong presentation of the calf, its back being turned downward or to\r\none side in place of upward toward the spine of the dam; from the bending\r\nbackward of one or more limbs or of the head into the body of the womb;\r\nfrom presentation of the back, shoulder, or croup, all four limbs being\r\nturned back; from presentation of all four feet at once; from obstruction\r\ncaused by an extra head or extra limbs, or double body on the part of the\r\noffspring (Pl. XIX); from dropsy or other disease of the calf; from\r\nexcessive or imperfect development of the calf; from the impaction of twins\r\ninto the passages at the same time; or at times it may be from the mere\r\nexcessive volume of the fetus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL MAXIMS FOR THE ASSISTANT CONCERNING DIFFICULT PARTURITION.\r\n\r\nDo not interfere too soon. \"Meddlesome midwifery is bad\" with animals as\r\nwith women. After labor pains set in, give a reasonable time for the water\r\nbags to protrude and burst spontaneously, and only interfere when delay\r\nsuggests some mechanical obstruction. If there is no mechanical\r\nobstruction, let the calf be expelled slowly by the unaided efforts of the\r\ncow. Bruises and lacerations of the passages and flooding from the\r\nuncontracted womb may come from the too speedy extraction of the calf. When\r\nassistance is necessary, the operator should dress in a thick flannel shirt\r\nfrom which the sleeves have been cut off clear to the shoulders. This\r\navoids danger of exposure and yet leaves the whole arm free and\r\nuntrammeled. Before inserting the hand it and the arm should be smeared\r\nwith oil, lard, or vaseline, care being taken that the oil or lard is\r\nfresh, neither salted nor rancid, and that it has been purified by boiling\r\nor rendered antiseptic by the addition of a teaspoonful of carbolic acid to\r\nthe pound. This is a valuable precaution against infecting the cow by\r\nintroducing putrid ferments into the passages and against poisoning of the\r\narm by decomposing discharges in case the calving is unduly protracted.\r\nWhen labor pains have lasted some time without any signs of the water bags,\r\nthe dropping in at the sides of the rump, and the other preparations for\r\ncalving being accomplished, the hand should be introduced to examine. When\r\nthe water bags have burst and neither feet nor head appear for some time,\r\nexamination should be made. When one fore foot only and the head appear, or\r\nboth fore feet without the head, or the head without the fore feet,\r\nexamine. If one hind foot appears without the other, make examination. The\r\npresenting limb or head should be secured by a rope with a running noose,\r\nso that it may not pass back into the womb and get lost during the\r\nsubsequent manipulations, but may be retained in the vagina or brought up\r\nagain easily. In searching for a missing member it is usually better to\r\nturn the head of the cow downhill, so that the gravitation of the fetus and\r\nabdominal organs forward into the belly of the cow may give more room in\r\nwhich to bring up the missing limb or head. If the cow is lying down, turn\r\nher on the side opposite to that on which the limb is missing, so that\r\nthere may be more room for bringing the latter up. Even if a missing limb\r\nis reached, it is vain to attempt to bring it up during a labor pain. Wait\r\nuntil the pain has ceased and attempt to straighten out the limb before the\r\nnext pain comes on. If the pains are violent and continuous, they may be\r\nchecked by pinching the back or by putting a tight surcingle around the\r\nbody in front of the udder. These failing, 1 ounce or 1-1/2 ounces of\r\nchloral hydrate in a quart of water may be given to check the pains. If the\r\npassages have dried up or lost their natural, lubricating liquid, smear the\r\ninterior of the passages and womb and the surface of the calf, so far as it\r\ncan be reached, with pure fresh lard; or pure sweet oil may be run into the\r\nwomb through a rubber tube (fountain syringe). In dragging upon the fetus\r\napply strong traction only while the mother is straining, and drag downward\r\ntoward the hocks as well as backward. The natural curvature of both fetus\r\nand passages is thus followed and the extraction rendered easier.\r\n\r\n\r\nLABOR PAINS BEFORE RELAXATION OF THE PASSAGES.\r\n\r\nAny of the various causes of abortion may bring on labor pains before the\r\ntime. Straining comes on days or weeks before the time, and there is not\r\nthe usual enlargement, swelling, and mucous discharge from the vulva. There\r\nis little or no falling in by the sides of the root of the tail; the\r\nabdomen has not dropped to the usual extent, and the udder is less\r\ndeveloped and yields little or no milk. In spite of the pains no water bags\r\nappear, and the oiled hand cautiously introduced into the vagina finds the\r\nneck of the womb firmly closed, rigid, and undilatable. If it is known that\r\nthe cow has not reached her proper time of calving, the examination through\r\nthe vagina should be omitted and the animal should be placed in a dark,\r\nquiet place by herself, and be given 1 to 2 ounces laudanum. _Viburnum\r\nprunifolium_ (black haw), 1 ounce, may be added, if necessary, and repeated\r\nin three hours. The pains will usually subside.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the external parts are relaxed and duly prepared, but the\r\nneck of the womb remains rigidly closed. In such case the solid extract of\r\nbelladonna should be smeared around the constricted opening and the animal\r\nleft quiet until it relaxes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASED INDURATION OF THE MOUTH OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nFrom previous lacerations or other injuries the neck of the womb may have\r\nbecome the seat of fibrous hardening and constriction, so as to prevent its\r\ndilatation, when all other parts are fully prepared for calving. The\r\nenlarged, flabby vulva, the sinking at each side of the rump, the full\r\nudder, and drooping abdomen indicate the proper time for calving, but the\r\nlabor pains effect no progress in the dilatation of the mouth of the womb,\r\nand the oiled hand introduced detects the rigid, hard, and, in some cases,\r\nnodular feeling of the margins of the closed orifice which no application\r\nof belladonna or other antispasmodic suffices to relax. Sponge tents may be\r\ninserted or the mechanical dilator (Pl. XX, fig. 6) may be used if there is\r\nopening enough to admit it, and if not, a narrow-bladed, probe-pointed\r\nknife (Pl. XXIV, fig. 2) may be passed through the orifice and turned\r\nupward, downward, and to each side, cutting to a depth not exceeding a\r\nquarter of an inch in each case. This done, a finger may be inserted, then\r\ntwo, three, and four, and finally all four fingers and thumb brought\r\ntogether in the form of a cone and made to push in with rotary motion until\r\nthe whole hand can be introduced. After this the labor pains will induce\r\nfurther dilation, and finally the presenting members of the calf will\r\ncomplete the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nTWISTING OF THE NECK OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nThis is not very uncommon in the cow, the length of the body of the womb\r\nand the looseness of the broad ligaments that attach it to the walls of the\r\npelvis favoring the twisting. It is as if one were to take a long sack\r\nrather loosely filled at the neck and turn over its closed end, so that its\r\ntwisting should occur in the neck. The twist may be one-quarter round, so\r\nthat the upper surface would come to look to one side, or it may be half\r\nround, so that what was the upper surface becomes the lower. The relation\r\nof the womb of the cow to the upper and right side of the paunch favors the\r\ntwisting. The paunch occupies the whole left side of the abdomen and\r\nextends across its floor to the right side. Its upper surface thus forms an\r\ninclined plane, sloping from the left downward and to the right, and on\r\nthis sloping surface lies the pregnant womb.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to see how, in the constant movements of the paunch upon its\r\ncontents and the frequent changes of position of the growing fetus within\r\nthe womb, to say nothing of the contractions of the adjacent bowels and the\r\nmore or less active movements of the cow, the womb should roll downward to\r\nthe right. Yet in many cases the twist is toward the left, showing that it\r\nis not the result of a simple rolling downward over the paunch, but rather\r\nof other disturbances. The condition may be suspected when labor pains have\r\ncontinued for some time without any sign of the water bags, and it is\r\nconfirmed when the oiled hand, introduced through the vagina, finds the\r\nmouth of the womb soft and yielding, but furnished with internal folds\r\nrunning forward in a spiral manner. If the folds on the upper wall of the\r\norifice run toward the right, the womb is twisted to the right; if, on the\r\ncontrary, they turn toward the left, it indicates that the womb is turned\r\nover in that direction. The direction of the twist must be known before\r\ntreatment can be undertaken. Then, if the twist is toward the right, the\r\ncow is laid upon her right side with her head downhill, the hand of the\r\noperator is introduced through the spirally constricted neck of the womb,\r\nand a limb or other portion of the body of the calf is seized and pressed\r\nfirmly against the wall of the womb. Meanwhile two or three assistants roll\r\nthe cow from her right side over on her back to her left side. The object\r\nis to hold the womb and calf still while the body of the cow rolls over. If\r\nsuccessful, the twist is undone, its grasp on the wrist is slackened, and\r\nthe water bags and calf press into the now open passage. If the first\r\nattempt does not succeed, it is to be repeated until success has been\r\nattained. If the spiral folds on the upper wall of the opening turn toward\r\nthe left, the cow is laid on her left side and rolled over on her back and\r\non to the right side, the hand being, as before, within the womb and\r\nholding the fetus, so that all may not rotate with the cow. In introducing\r\nthe hand it will usually be found needful to perforate the membranes, so\r\nthat a limb of the calf may be seized direct and firmly held. Among my\r\noccasional causes of failure with these cases have been, first, the\r\nprevious death and decomposition of the fetus, leading to such\r\noverdistention of the womb that it could not be made to rotate within the\r\nabdomen, and, second, the occurrence of inflammation and an exudate on the\r\ntwisted neck of the womb, which hindered it from untwisting.\r\n\r\nIn obstinate cases, in which the hand can be made to pass through the neck\r\nof the womb easily, additional help may be had from the use of the\r\ninstrument shown in Plate XX, figure 5. Two cords, with running nooses, are\r\nsuccessively introduced and made fast on two limbs of the calf; the cords\r\nare then passed through the two rings on the end of the instrument, which\r\nis passed into the womb and the cords drawn tight and fixed round the\r\nhandle. Then, using the handle as a lever, it is turned in the direction\r\nopposite to the twist. The hand should meanwhile be introduced into the\r\nwomb and the snared limbs seized and pressed against its walls so as to\r\nsecure the rotation of the uterus along with the body of the fetus. The\r\nrelaxation of the constriction and the effacement of the spiral folds will\r\nshow when success has been gained, and the different members at one end of\r\nthe body should then be brought up so as to secure a natural presentation.\r\n\r\n\r\nNARROW PELVIS FROM FRACTURE OR DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIn a small cow the pelvis may be too narrow to pass a calf sired by a bull\r\nof a large breed, but this is exceptional, as the fetus usually\r\naccommodates itself to the size of the dam and makes its extra growth after\r\nbirth. When the pelvic bones have been fractured repair takes place with\r\nthe formation of a large permanent callus, which, projecting internally,\r\nmay be a serious obstacle to calving. Worse still, if the edge of the\r\nbroken bone projects internally as a sharp spike or ridge, the vaginal\r\nwalls are cut upon it during the passage of the calf, with serious or fatal\r\nresult. In other cases, where the cow has suffered from fragility of bone\r\n(fragilitas ossium) the thickening of the bone causes narrowing of the long\r\npassage of the pelvis and the crumbling fractures poorly repaired, with an\r\nexcess of brittle new material, may form an insuperable obstacle to\r\nparturition. Cows affected in any of these ways should never again be bred,\r\nbut if they do get pregnant and reach full time a careful examination will\r\nbe necessary to determine whether natural parturition can take place or if\r\nthe calf must be extracted in pieces. (See \"Embryotomy,\" p. 202.)\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION BY MASSES OF FAT.\r\n\r\nThis is not unknown in old cows of the beef breeds, the enormous masses of\r\nfat upon and within the pelvis being associated with weakness or fatty\r\ndegeneration of the muscles. If the presentation is natural, little more is\r\nwanted than a judicious traction upon the fetus to compress and overcome\r\nthe soft resisting masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSTRUCTION BY A FULL BLADDER OR RECTUM OR BY STONE.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of delayed or tardy parturition the evacuation of rectum and\r\nbladder is important, and it is no less so in all difficult parturitions.\r\nStone in the bladder is fortunately rare in the cow, but when present it\r\nshould be removed to obviate crushing and perhaps perforation of the organ\r\nduring calving.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVING RETARDED BY NERVOUSNESS.\r\n\r\nIn a public fair ground I have seen labor pains begin early in the day and\r\nkeep up in a weak and insufficient manner for many hours, until the stall\r\nwas thoroughly closed in and the cow secluded from the constant stream of\r\nvisitors and the incessant noise, when at once the pains became strong and\r\neffective and the calf was soon born.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOAGULATED BLOOD UNDER THE VAGINAL WALLS.\r\n\r\nThis is common after calving, but sometimes occurs before, as the result of\r\naccidental injury. The mass may be recognized by its dark hue and the\r\ndoughy sensation to the touch. It may be cut into and the mass turned out\r\nwith the fingers, after which it should be washed frequently with an\r\nantiseptic lotion (carbolic acid 1 dram in 1 quart of water).\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRICTION OF A MEMBER BY THE NAVEL STRING.\r\n\r\nIn early fetal life the winding of the navel string around a limb may cause\r\nthe latter to be slowly cut off by absorption under the constricting cord.\r\nSo at calving the cord wound round a presenting member may retard progress\r\nsomewhat, and though the calf may still be born tardily by the unaided\r\nefforts of the mother, it is liable to come still-born, because the\r\ncirculation in the cord is interrupted by compression before the offspring\r\ncan reach the open air and commence to breathe. If, therefore, it is\r\npossible to anticipate and prevent this displacement and compression of the\r\nnavel string it should be done, but if this is no longer possible, then the\r\nextraction of the calf should be effected as rapidly as possible, and if\r\nbreathing is not at once attempted it should be started by artificial\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER IN THE HEAD OF THE CALF (HYDROCEPHALUS).\r\n\r\nThis is an enormous distention of the cavity holding the brain, by reason\r\nof the accumulation of liquid in the internal cavities (ventricles) of the\r\nbrain substance. The head back of the eyes rises into a great rounded ball\r\n(Pl. XIX, figs. 4 and 5), which proves an insuperable obstacle to\r\nparturition. The fore feet and nose being the parts presented, no progress\r\ncan be made, and even if the feet are pulled upon the nose can not by any\r\nmeans be made to appear. The oiled hand introduced into the passages will\r\nfeel the nose presenting between the fore limbs, and on passing the hand\r\nback over the face the hard rounded mass of the cranium is met with. A\r\nsharp-pointed knife or a cannula and trocar should be introduced in the\r\npalm of the hand and pushed into the center of the rounded mass so as to\r\nevacuate the water. The hand is now used to press together the hitherto\r\ndistended but thin and fragile walls, and the calf may be delivered in the\r\nnatural way. If the enlarged head is turned backward it must still be\r\nreached and punctured, after which it must be brought up into position and\r\nthe calf delivered.\r\n\r\nIf the hind feet present first, all may go well until the body and\r\nshoulders have passed out, when further progress is suddenly arrested by\r\nthe great bulk of the head. If possible, the hand, armed with a knife or\r\ntrocar, must be passed along the side of the shoulder or neck so as to\r\nreach and puncture the distended head. Failing in this, the body may be\r\nskinned up from the belly and cut in two at the shoulder or neck, after\r\nwhich the head can easily be reached and punctured. If in such case the\r\nfore limbs have been left in the womb, they may now be brought up into the\r\npassage, and when dragged upon the collapsed head will follow.\r\n\r\nIf the distention is not sufficient to have rendered the bony walls of the\r\ncranium thin and fragile, so that they can be compressed with the hand\r\nafter puncture, a special method may be necessary. A long incision should\r\nbe made from behind forward in the median line of the cranium with an\r\nembryotomy knife (Pl. XXI, fig. 1) or with a long embryotome (Pl. XX, fig.\r\n3). By this means the bones on the one side are completely separated from\r\nthose on the other and may be made to overlap and perhaps to flatten down.\r\nIf this fails they may be cut from the head all around the base of the\r\nrounded cranial swelling by means of a guarded chisel (Pl. XX, fig. 8) and\r\nmallet, after which there will be no difficulty in causing them to\r\ncollapse.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE ABDOMEN OF THE CALF (ASCITES).\r\n\r\nThis is less frequent than hydrocephalus, but no less difficult to deal\r\nwith. With an anterior presentation the fore limbs and head may come away\r\neasily enough, but no effort will advance the calf beyond the shoulders.\r\nThe first thought should be dropsy of the belly, and the oiled hand\r\nintroduced by the side of the chest will detect the soft and fluctuating\r\nyet tense sac of the abdomen. If there is space to allow of the\r\nintroduction of an embryotomy knife, the abdomen may be freely cut with\r\nthis, when the fluid will escape into the womb and parturition may proceed\r\nnaturally. If this can not be effected, a long trocar and cannula may be\r\npassed between the first two ribs and straight on beneath the spine until\r\nit punctures the abdomen. (Pl. XVIII, fig. 2.) Then the trocar is to be\r\nwithdrawn and the liquid will flow through the cannula and will be hastened\r\nby traction on the fore limbs. In the absence of the trocar and cannula,\r\ntwo or three of the first ribs may be cut from the breastbone, so that the\r\nhand may be introduced through the chest to puncture the diaphragm with an\r\nembryotomy knife and allow an escape of the water. In some slighter cases a\r\ntardy delivery may take place without puncture, the liquid bulging forward\r\ninto the chest as the abdomen is compressed in the pelvic passages. With a\r\nposterior presentation the abdomen may be punctured more easily either in\r\nthe flank or with a trocar and cannula through the anus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DROPSY OF THE CALF.\r\n\r\nThis occurs from watery blood or disease of some internal organ, like the\r\nliver or kidney, and is recognized by the general puffed-up and rounded\r\ncondition of the body, which pits everywhere on pressure but without\r\ncrackling. If not too extreme a case, the calf may be extracted after it\r\nhas been very generally punctured over the body, but usually the only\r\nresort is to extract it in pieces. (See \"Embryotomy,\" p. 202.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSWELLING OF THE CALF WITH GAS.\r\n\r\nThis is usually the result of the death and decomposition of the fetus when\r\nextraction has been delayed for a day or more after the escape of the\r\nwaters. It is impossible to extract it whole, owing to its large size and\r\nthe dry state of the skin of the calf, the membranes, and the wall of the\r\nwomb. These dry surfaces stick with such tenacity that no attempt at\r\ntraction leads to any advance of the calf out of the womb or into the\r\npassages. When the fetus is advanced the adherent womb advances with it,\r\nand when the strain is relaxed both recede to where they were at first. The\r\ncondition may be helped somewhat by the free injection of oil into the\r\nwomb, but it remains impossible to extract the enormously bloated body, and\r\nthe only resort is to cut it in pieces and extract it by degrees. (See\r\n\"Embryotomy,\" p. 202.)\r\n\r\n\r\nRIGID CONTRACTIONS OF MUSCLES.\r\n\r\nIn the development of the calf, as in after life, the muscles are subject\r\nto cramps, and in certain cases given groups of muscles remain unnaturally\r\nshort, so that even the bones grow in a twisted and distorted way. In one\r\ncase the head and neck are drawn round to one side and can not be\r\nstraightened out, even the bones of the face and the nose being curved\r\naround to that side. In other cases the flexor muscles of the fore legs are\r\nso shortened that the knees are kept constantly bent and can not be\r\nextended by force. The bent neck may sometimes be sufficiently straightened\r\nfor extraction by cutting across the muscles on the side to which it is\r\nturned, and the bent knees by cutting the cords on the back of the shank\r\nbones just below the knees. If this fails, there remains the resort of\r\ncutting off the distorted limbs or head. (See \"Embryotomy,\" p. 202.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE CALF (INCLOSED OVUM).\r\n\r\nTumors or new growths grow on the unborn calf as on the mature animal, and\r\nby increasing the diameter of the body render its progress through the\r\npassage of the pelvis impossible. In my experience with large, fleshy\r\ntumors of the abdomen, I have cut open the chest, removed the lungs and\r\nheart, cut through the diaphragm with the knife, and removed the tumor\r\npiecemeal by alternate tearing and cutting until the volume of the body was\r\nsufficiently reduced to pass through. Where this failed it would remain to\r\ncut off the anterior part of the body, removing as much of the chest as\r\npossible, and cutting freely through the diaphragm; then, pushing back the\r\nremainder of the body, the hind limbs may be seized and brought into the\r\npassages and the residue thus extracted. The tumor, unless very large, will\r\nget displaced backward so as not to prove an insuperable obstacle.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the apparent tumor is a blighted ovum which has failed to\r\ndevelop, but has grafted itself on its more fortunate twin and from it has\r\ndrawn its nourishment. These are usually sacs containing hair, skin,\r\nmuscle, bone, or other natural tissues, and only exceptionally do they show\r\nthe distinct outline of the animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSTROSITY IN THE CALF.\r\n\r\nAs a monstrous development in the calf may hinder calving, it is well to\r\nconsider shortly the different directions in which these deviations from\r\nthe natural form appear. Their origin and significance will be rendered\r\nclearer if we divide them according to the fault of development in\r\nindividual cases. Monsters are such--\r\n\r\n(1) From absence of parts--absence of head, limb, or other organ--arrested\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n(2) From some organ being unnaturally small, as a dwarfed head, limb,\r\ntrunk, etc.--arrested development.\r\n\r\n(3) From unnatural division of parts--cleft lips, palate, head, trunk,\r\nlimbs, etc.--abnormal growth.\r\n\r\n(4) From the absence of natural divisions--absence of mouth, nose, eye,\r\nanus; the cloven foot of ox or pig becomes solid, like that of the horse,\r\netc.--confluence of parts which are rightfully separate.\r\n\r\n(5) From the fusion of parts--both eyes replaced by central one, both\r\nnostrils merged into one central opening, etc.--confluence of parts.\r\n\r\n(6) From unnatural position or form of parts--curved nose, neck, back,\r\nlimbs, etc.--lack of balance in the growth of muscles during development.\r\n\r\n(7) From excessive growth of one or more organs--enormous size of head,\r\ndouble penis, superfluous digits, etc.--redundancy of growth at given\r\npoints.\r\n\r\n(8) From imperfect differentiation of the sexual organs--hermaphrodites\r\n(organs intermediate between male and female), male organs with certain\r\nfeminine characters, female organs with certain well-marked male\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\n(9) From the doubling of parts or of the entire body--double monsters,\r\ndoubled heads, doubled bodies, extra limbs, etc.--redundant development.\r\n(Pl. XIX, figs. 1, 2, 3.)\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes of monstrosities are varied. Some, like extra digits,\r\nlack of horns, etc., run in families, which produce them with absolute\r\ncertainty when bred in the direct line, although they were originally\r\nacquired peculiarities which have merely been fixed by long habit in\r\nsuccessive generations. The earliest horse had five toes, and even the most\r\nrecent fossil horse had three toes, of which the two lateral ones are still\r\nrepresented in the modern animal by the two splint bones. Yet if our horse\r\ndevelops an extra toe it is pronounced a monstrosity. A more genuine\r\nmonstrosity is the solid-hoofed pig, in which two toes have been merged\r\ninto one. Another of the same kind is the solid shank bone of the ox, which\r\nconsists of two bones united into one, but which are still found apart in\r\nthe early fetus. Though originally acquired peculiarities, they now breed\r\nas invariably as color or form.\r\n\r\nOther monstrosities seem to have begun in too close breeding, by which the\r\npowers of symmetrical development are impaired, just as the procreative\r\npower weakens under continuous breeding from the closest blood relations. A\r\nmonstrosity consisting in the absence of an organ often depends on a simple\r\nlack of development, the result of disease or injury, as a young bone is\r\npermanently shortened by being broken across the soft part between the\r\nshaft and the end, the only part where increase in length can take place.\r\nAs the result of the injury the soft, growing layer becomes prematurely\r\nhard and all increase in length at that end of the bone ceases. This will\r\naccount for some cases of absence of eye, limb, or other organ.\r\n\r\nSometimes a monstrosity is owing to the inclosure of one ovum in another\r\nwhile the latter is still but a soft mass of cells and can easily close\r\naround the first. Here each ovum has an independent life; they develop\r\nsimultaneously, only the outer one having direct connection with the womb\r\nand being furnished with abundant nourishment advances most rapidly and\r\nperfectly, while the inclosed and starved ovum is dwarfed and imperfect\r\noften to the last degree.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of excess of parts the extra part or member is manifestly\r\nderived from the same ovum, and even the same part of the ovum, being\r\nmerely the effect of a redundancy and vagary of growth. Such cases include\r\nmost instances of extra digits or other organs, and even of double\r\nmonsters, as manifested by the fact that such extra organs grow from the\r\nnormal identical organs. Hence the extra digit is attached to the normal\r\ndigit, the extra head to the one neck, the extra tail to the croup, extra\r\nteeth to the existing teeth, and even two similarly formed bodies are\r\nattached by some point common to both, as the navels, breastbones, backs,\r\netc. (Pl. XIX, figs. 1, 2, 3.) This shows that both have been derived from\r\nthe same primitive layer of the embryo, which possessed the plastic power\r\nof building up a given structure or set of organs. An inclosed ovum, on the\r\nother hand, has no such identity or similarity of structure to the part\r\nwith which it is connected, showing an evident primary independence of both\r\nlife and the power of building tissues and organs. The power of determining\r\nextra growth along a given natural line is very highly developed in the\r\nearly embryo and is equally manifest in the mature examples of some of the\r\nlower forms of animal life. Thus a newt will grow a new tail when that\r\nmember has been cut off, and a starfish will develop as many new starfishes\r\nas the pieces made by cutting up the original one. This power of growth in\r\nthe embryo and in the lower form of animals is comparable to the branching\r\nout again of a tree at the places from which branches have been lopped. The\r\npresence of this vegetablelike power of growth in the embryo accounts for\r\nmost double monsters.\r\n\r\nThe influence of disease in modifying growth in the early embryo,\r\nincreasing, decreasing, distorting, etc., is well illustrated in the\r\nexperiments of St. Hilaire and Valentine in varnishing, shaking, or\r\notherwise disturbing the connections of eggs and thereby producing\r\nmonstrosities. One can easily understand how inflammations and other causes\r\nof disturbed circulation in the womb, fetal membranes, or fetus would cause\r\nsimilar distortions and variations in the growing fetus. It is doubtless\r\nlargely in the same way that certain mental disturbances of a very\r\nsusceptible dam affect the appearance of the progeny. The monstrosities\r\nwhich seriously interfere with calving are mainly such as consist in extra\r\nmembers or head, which can not be admitted into the passages at the same\r\ntime, where some organ of the body has attained extra size, where a\r\nblighted ovum has been inclosed in the body of a more perfect one, or where\r\nthe body or limbs are so contracted or twisted that the calf must enter the\r\npassages doubled up.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Extraction is sometimes possible by straightening the\r\ndistorted members by the force of traction; in other cases the muscles or\r\ntendons must be cut across on the side to which the body or limbs are bent\r\nto allow of such straightening. Thus, the muscles on the concave side of a\r\nwry neck or the cords behind the shank bones of a contracted limb may be\r\ncut to allow of these parts being brought into the passages, and there will\r\nstill be wanting the methods demanded for bringing up missing limbs or\r\nhead, for which see paragraphs below. In most cases of monstrosity by\r\nexcess of overgrowth it becomes necessary to cut off the supernumerary or\r\noverdeveloped parts, and the same general principles must be followed as\r\nlaid down in \"Embryotomy\" (p. 202).\r\n\r\n\r\n  WRONG PRESENTATIONS OF THE CALF.\r\n\r\n  The following is a list of abnormal presentations of the calf:\r\n\r\n  Simultaneous presentation of twins.\r\n\r\n  A   {          {Limbs curved at the knee.

Thus, in each anterior or posterior\r\npresentation, with the back of the calf turned downward or to one side, the\r\ncase may be complicated by the bending back of one or more members as a\r\nwhole or at the joint just above the shank bones (knee or hock). So also in\r\nsuch anterior presentation the head may be turned back.\r\n\r\n_Head and fore feet presented--Back turned to one side._--The calf has a\r\ngreater diameter from above down (spine to breastbone) than it has from\r\nside to side, and the same is true of the passage of the pelvis of the cow,\r\nwhich measures, on an average, 8-7/10 inches from above downward and 7-9/10\r\ninches from side to side. Hence the calf passes most easily with its back\r\nupward, and when turned with its back to one side calving is always tardy\r\nand may be difficult or impossible. The obvious remedy is to rotate the\r\ncalf on its own axis until its spine turns toward the spine of the cow. The\r\noperation is not difficult if the body of the calf is not yet fixed in the\r\npassages. The presenting feet are twisted over each other in the direction\r\ndesired, and this is continued until the head and spine have assumed their\r\nproper place. If the body is firmly engaged in the passages the skin of the\r\nwhole engaged portion should be freely lubricated with lard, and the limbs\r\nand head twisted over each other as above. The limbs may be twisted by an\r\nassistant when the head is manipulated by the operator, who drags on the\r\nrope turned halfway round the limbs and assists in the rotation with his\r\nother hand in the passages.\r\n\r\n_Head and fore feet presented--Back turned down toward the udder._--This\r\nposition (Pl. XVI, fig. 6) is unnatural, and the parturition is difficult\r\nfor two reasons: First, the natural curvature of the fetus is opposed to\r\nthe natural curvature of the passages; and, second, the thickest part of\r\nthe body of the calf (the upper) is engaged in the narrowest part of the\r\npassage of the pelvis (the lower). Yet unless the calf is especially large\r\nand the pelvis of the cow narrow, parturition may usually be accomplished\r\nin this way spontaneously or with very little assistance in the way of\r\ntraction on the limbs. If this can not be accomplished, two courses are\r\nopen: First, to rotate the calf as when the back is turned to one side;\r\nsecond, to push back the presenting fore limbs and head and search for and\r\nbring up the hind limbs, when the presentation will be a natural, posterior\r\none.\r\n\r\n_Presentation of the hind feet with the back turned to one side or\r\ndownward._--These are the exact counterparts of the two conditions last\r\ndescribed, are beset with similar drawbacks, and are to be dealt with on\r\nthe same general principles. (Pl. XVII, fig. 4.) With the back turned to\r\none side the body should be rotated until the back turns toward the spine\r\nof the dam, and with the back turned down it must be extracted in that\r\nposition (care being taken that the feet do not perforate the roof of the\r\nvagina) or it must be rotated on its own axis until the back turns upward,\r\nor the hind limbs must be pushed back and the fore limbs and head advanced,\r\nwhen the presentation will be a natural anterior one.\r\n\r\n_Impaction of twins in the passage._--It is very rare to have twins enter\r\nthe passages together so as to become firmly impacted. As a rule, each of\r\nthe twins has its own separate membranes, and as the water bags of one will\r\nnaturally first enter and be the first to burst, so the calf which occupied\r\nthose membranes will be the first to enter the passage and the other will\r\nbe thereby excluded. When the membranes of both have burst without either\r\ncalf having become engaged in the pelvis, it becomes possible for the fore\r\nlegs of one and the hind legs of the other to enter at one time, and if the\r\nstraining is very violent they may become firmly impacted. (Pl. XVIII, fig.\r\n1.) The condition may be recognized by the fact that two of the presenting\r\nfeet have their fronts turned forward, while the two others have their\r\nfronts turned backward. If the four feet belonged to one natural calf, they\r\nwould all have the same direction. By means of this difference in direction\r\nwe can easily select the two feet of one calf, place running nooses upon\r\nthem just above the hoofs or fetlocks, and have an assistant drag upon the\r\nropes while the feet of the other calf are pushed back. In selecting one of\r\nthe twins to come first several considerations should have weight. The one\r\nthat is most advanced in the passage is, of course, the first choice.\r\nThough the fore feet of one are presented, yet if the head is not in place\r\nthe calf presenting by its hind feet is to be chosen as being less liable\r\nto obstruct. Again, if for either calf one limb only is presented and the\r\nother missing, the one presenting two feet should be selected to come\r\nfirst. As soon as one calf has been advanced so as to occupy the pelvis the\r\nother will be crowded back so that it will not seriously obstruct.\r\n\r\n_Fore limbs curved at the knee--Limbs sprawling outward._--In this case not\r\nonly are the knees somewhat bent in a curve, but the calf has a position as\r\nif it rested on its breastbone, while the legs were drawn apart and\r\ndirected to the right and left. The shoulder blades being drawn outward\r\nfrom the chest and the elbows turned out, the muscles extending from the\r\ntrunk to the limb are unduly stretched and keep the knees bent and the feet\r\ndirected outward so as to press on the sides of the passages. They become\r\nretarded in their progress as compared with the more rapidly advancing\r\nhead, and may bruise or even lacerate the walls of the vagina. It would\r\nseem easy to rectify this by extending the legs, but the already tense and\r\noverstretched muscles operate against extension in the present position,\r\nand it is not easy to rotate the limbs so as to apply the shoulder flat\r\nagainst the side of the chest. Under these circumstances a repeller (Pl.\r\nXX, fig. 7) may be planted in the breast and the body of the calf pushed\r\nbackward into the womb, when the limbs will extend easily under traction\r\nand the presentation becomes at once natural.\r\n\r\n_Fore limbs curved at knee--Flexor tendons shortening._--In this case the\r\nfeet will press against the floor of the pelvis though the limb has no\r\noutward direction, and the shoulder meanwhile presses against the roof of\r\nthe same passage. Unless the knees can be sufficiently straightened by\r\nforce a knife must be used to cut across the cords behind the knee, when\r\nthe limbs may be straightened sufficiently.\r\n\r\n_Fore limbs flexed at knee--Flexor tendons unshortened._--This is mostly\r\nseen in cases in which the body of the calf is in the proper position, its\r\nback being turned up toward the back of the dam, and in cows with a\r\ndrooping abdomen. The feet have been supposed to catch beneath the brim of\r\nthe pelvis, and being retarded while the head advances into the passages,\r\nthey get bent at the knee and the nose and knees present. (Pl. XVI, fig.\r\n2.) The calf, however, is not an inanimate body advanced by the mere\r\ncontraction of the womb, but it moves its limbs freely under the stimulus\r\nof the unwonted compression, and in moving the feet as they are advanced\r\nthey slip down over the pelvic brim and finding no other firm support they\r\nbend back until, under the impulsion, they can no longer straighten out\r\nagain. The knees, therefore, advance with the neck and head, but the feet\r\nremain bent back. The result is that the upper part of the limb is also\r\nflexed, and the shoulder blade and arm bone with their masses of investing\r\nmuscles are carried backward and applied on the side of the chest, greatly\r\nincreasing the bulk of this already bulky part. As the elbow is carried\r\nback on the side of the chest, the forearm from elbow to knee further\r\nincreases the superadded masses of the shoulder and renders it difficult or\r\nimpossible to drag the mass through the passages. When the fore limbs are\r\nfully extended, on the contrary, the shoulder blade is extended forward on\r\nthe smallest and narrowest part of the chest, the arm bone with its muscles\r\nis in great part applied against the side of the back part of the neck, and\r\nthe forearm is continued forward by the side of the head so that the nose\r\nlies between the knees. In this natural presentation the presenting body of\r\nthe calf forms a long wedge or cone, the increase of which is slow and\r\ngradual until it reaches the middle of the chest.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of extending the fore limbs will be in proportion to the\r\nadvance of the head through the pelvic cavity. In the early stage all that\r\nis necessary may be to introduce the oiled hand, the left one for the right\r\nleg or the right one for the left, and passing the hand from the knee on to\r\nthe foot to seize the foot in the palm, bend it forcibly on the fetlock,\r\nand lift it up over the brim of the pelvis, the knee being, of course,\r\npressed upward against the spine. As soon as the foot has been raised above\r\nthe brim of the pelvis (into the passage) the limb can be straightened out\r\nwith the greatest ease.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the shoulders are already engaging in the pelvis the feet\r\ncan not thus be lifted up, and to gain room a repeller (Pl. XX, fig. 7)\r\nmust be used to push back the body of the calf. This is an instrument with\r\na long, straight stem, divided at the end into two short branches (2 to 3\r\ninches long) united to the stem by hinges so that they can be brought into\r\na line with the stem for introduction into the womb and then spread to be\r\nimplanted in the breast. In the absence of a repeller a smooth, round, fork\r\nhandle may be used, the prongs having been removed from the other end. A\r\nthird device is to have an assistant strip his arm to the shoulder and,\r\nstanding back to back with the operator, to introduce his right arm into\r\nthe passages along with the operator's left (or vice versa) and push back\r\nthe body of the calf while the operator seeks to bring up a limb. The\r\nrepeller or staff having been planted safely in the breast of the calf, an\r\nassistant pushes upon it in a direction either forward or slightly upward,\r\nso as not only to follow the natural curve of the body and favor its\r\nturning in the line of that curve within the womb, but also to carry the\r\nshoulders upward toward the spine and obtain more room for bringing up the\r\nmissing feet. It is good policy, first, to put a halter (Pl. XXI, figs.\r\n4_a_ and 4_b_) on the head or a noose (Pl. XXI, fig. 3) on the lower jaw\r\nand a rope round each limb at the knee, so as to provide against the loss\r\nof any of these parts when the body is pushed back into the womb. This\r\noffers the further advantage that by dragging upon these ropes the body can\r\nbe advanced in the passage until the foot is reached, when the rope must be\r\nslackened and the repeller used to get room for bringing up the foot. If\r\nthe cow is lying, the operator should first secure the foot on the upper\r\nside and then, if necessary, turn the cow on its opposite side so as to\r\nbring up the other.\r\n\r\nIn using the instruments some precautions are demanded. They must be\r\ninvariably warmed before they are introduced, and they should be smeared\r\nwith lard or oil to make them pass easily and without friction. The\r\nassistant who is pushing on the instrument must be warned to stop if at any\r\ntime resistance gives way. This may mean the turning of the fetus, in which\r\ncase the object of repulsion has been accomplished, but much more probably\r\nit implies the displacement of the instrument from the body of the fetus,\r\nand unguarded pressure may drive it through the walls of the womb.\r\n\r\nWhen the calf enters the passage with its back turned down toward the belly\r\nand udder, the bending back of the fore limbs is rare, probably because the\r\nfeet can find a straighter and more nearly uniform surface of resistance in\r\nthe upper wall of the womb and the backbone, and do not slide over a crest\r\ninto an open cavity, as they do over the brim of the pelvis. The weight of\r\nthe calf, too, gravitating downward, leaves more room for the straightening\r\nof the bent limbs, so that the desired relief is much more easily secured.\r\nThe manipulation is the same in principle, only one must add the precaution\r\nof a steady traction on the feet in extraction, lest, owing to the adverse\r\ncurvature of the fetus, the hoofs are suddenly forced through the roof of\r\nthe vagina, and, perhaps, the rectum as well, during a specially powerful\r\nlabor pain.\r\n\r\nWhen the back of the calf is turned to the right side or the left the main\r\ndifference is that in addition to straightening the limbs the fetus must be\r\nrotated to turn its back upward before extraction is attempted. In this\r\ncase, too, it may be difficult to bring up and straighten the lower of the\r\ntwo limbs until the body has been rotated into its proper position. Cord\r\nthe upper straightened limb and head, then rotate the body and search for\r\nthe second missing limb.\r\n\r\n_Fore limbs bent back from the shoulders._--This is an exaggeration of the\r\ncondition just named, and is much more difficult to remedy, owing to the\r\ndistance and inaccessibility of the missing limb. It usually happens with\r\nthe proper position of the body, the back of the calf being turned toward\r\nthe back of the mother. The head presents in the passage and may even\r\nprotrude from the vulva during an active labor pain, but it starts back\r\nlike a spring when the straining ceases. Examination with the oiled hands\r\nin the intervals between the pains fails to detect the missing limbs. (Pl.\r\nXVI, fig. 1.) If, however, the hand can be introduced during a pain it may\r\nbe possible to reach the elbow or upper part of the forearm. In the absence\r\nof a pain a halter or noose on the head may be used to advance the whole\r\nbody until the forearm can be seized just below the elbow. This being\r\nfirmly held and the head or body pushed back into the womb, room may be\r\nobtained for bringing up the knee. The forearm is used as a lever, its\r\nupper part being strongly forced back while its lower part is pressed\r\nforward. If a pain supervenes the hold must be retained, and whatever gain\r\nhas been made must be held if possible. Then during the next pain, by\r\npushing back the body and continuing to operate the forearm as a lever, a\r\nstill further advance may be made. As the knee is brought up in this way,\r\nthe hand is slid down from the elbow toward the knee, which is finally\r\nbrought up over the brim of the pelvis and into the passage. It is now\r\ncorded at the knee, and the subsequent procedure is as described in the\r\nlast article. In a large, roomy cow with a small calf the latter may pass\r\nwith one or both forelegs bent back, but this is a very exceptional case,\r\nand, as early assistance is the most successful, there should never be\r\ndelay in hope of such a result.\r\n\r\n_One fore limb crossed over the back of the neck._--This is a rare obstacle\r\nto calving, but one that not altogether unknown. The hand introduced into\r\nthe passage feels the head and one forefoot, and farther back on the same\r\nside of the other foot, from which the womb can be traced obliquely across\r\nthe back of the neck. (Pl. XVI, fig. 3.) This foot, projecting\r\ntransversely, is liable to bruise or tear the vagina. If still deeply\r\nengaged in the vagina, it may be seized and pushed across to the opposite\r\nside of the neck, when the presentation will be natural.\r\n\r\n_Head bent down beneath the neck._--In this case, with drooping belly and\r\nwomb allowing the brim of the pelvis to form a ridge, the advancing calf,\r\nhaving unduly depressed its nose, strikes it on the brim of the pelvis, and\r\nthe neck advancing, the head is bent back and the poll and ears either\r\nenter the pelvis or strike against its brim. The two forefeet present, but\r\nthey make no progress, and the oiled hand introduced can detect no head\r\nuntil the poll is felt at the entrance of the pelvis, between the forearms.\r\nThe two forefeet must be fixed with running nooses and dragged on\r\nmoderately while the oiled hand seeks to bring up the head. The hand is\r\nslid down over the forehead and brim of the pelvis until the nose is\r\nreached, when it is passed into the mouth, the muzzle resting in the palm\r\nof the hand. The legs are now pushed upon, and in the space thus gained the\r\nmuzzle is drawn up so as to enter it into the pelvis. In doing this the\r\noperator must carefully see that the mouth does not drop open so that the\r\nsharp, front teeth cut through the floor of the womb. Should this danger\r\nthreaten, the hand should be made to cover the lower jaw as well. The\r\nlessened security of the hold is more than compensated by the safety of the\r\nprocedure. With the nose in the pelvis, it has only to be drawn forward and\r\nthe parturition is natural.\r\n\r\n_Head bent down beneath the breast._--This is an exaggerated condition of\r\nthat last named. The head, arrested by the brim of the pelvis and already\r\nbent back on the neck, is pressed farther with each successive throe until\r\nit has passed between the forelegs and lodges beneath the breast bone. (Pl.\r\nXVI, fig. 4.) On examination, the narrow upper border of the neck is felt\r\nbetween the forearms, but as a rule the head is out of reach below. Keeping\r\nthe hand on the neck and dragging on the feet by the aid of ropes, the hand\r\nmay come to touch and seize the ear, or, still better, one or two fingers\r\nmay be inserted into the orbit of the eye.\r\n\r\nThen in pushing back upon the limbs, with or without the aid of a repeller\r\napplied against the shoulder, space may be obtained to draw the head into a\r\nvertical position, and even to slip the hand down so as to seize the nose.\r\nShould it prove impossible to draw the head up with the unassisted fingers,\r\na blunt hook (Pl. XXI, fig. 6) may be inserted into the orbit, on which an\r\nassistant may drag while another pushes upon the limbs or repeller.\r\nMeanwhile the operator may secure an opportunity of reaching and seizing\r\nthe nose or of passing a blunt hook into the angle of the mouth. Success\r\nwill be better assured if two hooks (Pl. XXI, fig. 7) are inserted in the\r\ntwo orbits, so as to draw up the head more evenly. In other cases a noose\r\nmay be placed on the upper jaw, or even around both jaws, and traction made\r\nupon this and on the hooks in the orbits while the legs are pushed back,\r\nand while the operator pushes back on the poll or forehead. In still more\r\ndifficult cases, in which even the orbits can not be reached, a sharp hook\r\non the end of a straight iron rod (Pl. XX, fig. 2) may be inserted over the\r\nlower jaw as far forward as it can be reached, and by dragging upon this\r\nwhile the body is pushed back the head will be brought up sufficiently to\r\nallow the operator to reach the orbit or nose. If even the jaw can not be\r\nreached, the hook may be inserted in the neck as near to the head as\r\npossible and traction employed so as to bring the head within reach.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases the cow's head should be turned downhill, and in case of\r\nspecial difficulty she should be turned on her back and held there until\r\nthe head is secured. In old-standing cases, with the womb closely clasping\r\nthe body of the calf, relaxation may be sought by the use of chloroform or\r\na full dose of chloral hydrate--2 ounces; the free injection of warm water\r\ninto the womb will also be useful.\r\n\r\n_Head turned back on the shoulder._--With a natural, anterior presentation\r\nthis may happen because of the imperfect dilation of the mouth of the womb.\r\nUnder the throes of the mother the forefeet pass through the narrow opening\r\ninto the vagina, while the nose, striking against it and unable to enter,\r\nis pressed backward into the womb and turns aside on the right or left\r\nshoulder. The broad muzzle of the calf forms an especial obstacle to\r\nentrance and favors this deviation of the head. The worst form of this\r\ndeviation is the old-standing one with shortening of the muscles of the\r\nneck on that side, and oftentimes distortion of the face and neck bones, as\r\nnoticed under \"Monstrosities\" (p. 182).\r\n\r\nWhen the head is bent on the shoulder the feet appear in the natural way,\r\nbut no progress is made, and examination reveals the absence of the nose\r\nfrom between the knees, and farther back, from above and between the\r\nelbows, a smooth rounded mass is felt extending to the right or left, which\r\nfurther examination will identify with the neck. Following the upper border\r\nof this the hand reaches the crown of the head with the ears, and still\r\nfurther the eyes, or even, in a small calf, the nose.\r\n\r\nAs the bulky head of the calf can not be extracted along with the\r\nshoulders, it becomes necessary to push the body of the fetus back and\r\nstraighten out the head and neck. The cow should be laid with her head\r\ndownhill and with that side up toward which the head is turned. If the\r\nthroes are very violent, or the womb strongly contracted on the calf, it\r\nmay be best to seek relaxation by giving chloroform, or 2 ounces of\r\nlaudanum, or 2 ounces of chloral hydrate. If the calf or the passages are\r\ndry, sweet oil may be injected, or the whole may be liberally smeared with\r\nfresh lard. In the absence of these, warm water rendered slightly slippery\r\nby Castile soap may be injected into the womb in quantity. Ropes with\r\nrunning nooses are placed on the presenting feet and the oiled hand\r\nintroduced to find the head. If, now, the fingers can be passed inside the\r\nlower jawbone, and drag the head upward and toward the passage, it unwinds\r\nthe spiral turn given to the neck in bending back, and greatly improves the\r\nchances of bringing forward the nose. If, at first, or if now, the lower\r\njaw can be reached, a noose should be placed around it behind the incisor\r\nteeth and traction made upon this, so that the head may continue to be\r\nturned, forehead up, toward the spine and jaws down, thereby continuing to\r\nundo the screwlike curve of the neck. If, on the contrary, the nose is\r\ndragged upon by a cord passing over the upper border of the neck, the\r\nscrewlike twist is increased and the resistance of the bones and joints of\r\nthe neck prevents any straightening of the head. As soon as the lower jaw\r\nhas been seized by the hand or noose, a repeller (Pl. XX, fig. 7), planted\r\non the inside of the elbow or shoulder most distant from the head, should\r\nbe used to push back the body and turn it in the womb, so that the head may\r\nbe brought nearer to the outlet. In this way the head can usually be\r\nbrought into position and the further course of delivery will be natural.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the lower jaw can not be reached with the hand, and\r\nthen the orbit or, less desirably, the ear, may be availed of. The ear may\r\nbe pulled by the hand, and by the aid of the repeller on the other shoulder\r\nthe calf may be so turned that the lower jaw may be reached and availed of.\r\nBetter still, a clamp (Pl. XVIII, figs. 3 and 4) is firmly fixed on the ear\r\nand pulled by a rope, while the repeller is used on the opposite shoulder,\r\nand the hand of the operator pulls on the lower border of the neck and\r\nlifts it toward the other side. To pull on the upper border of the neck is\r\nto increase the spiral twist, while to raise the lower border is to undo\r\nit. If the outer orbit can be reached, the fingers may be inserted into it\r\nso as to employ traction, or a blunt finger hook (Pl. XXI, fig. 8) may be\r\nused, or a hook with a rope attached, or, finally, a hook on the end of a\r\nlong staff. Then, with the assistance of the repeller, the body may be so\r\nturned and the head advanced that the lower jaw may be reached and availed\r\nof.\r\n\r\nIn case neither the ears nor the orbit can be reached, a cord should be\r\npassed around the neck of the calf as near the head as possible, and\r\ntraction made upon that while the opposite shoulder is pushed toward the\r\nopposite side by the repeller, assisted by the hand dragging on the lower\r\nborder of the neck. To aid the hand in passing a rope around the neck a\r\ncord carrier (Pl. XXI, fig. 5) is in use. It fails, however, to help us in\r\nthe most difficult part of the operation--the passing of the cord down on\r\nthe deep or farthest side of the neck--and to remedy this I have devised a\r\ncord carrier, furnished with a ring at the end, a joint 6 or 8 inches from\r\nthe end, and another ring on the handle, close to this joint. (Pl. XX, fig.\r\n4.) A cord is passed through both rings and a knot tied on its end, just\r\nback of the terminal ring. The instrument, straightened out, is inserted\r\nuntil it reaches just beyond the upper border of the neck, when, by\r\ndragging on the cord, the movable segment is bent down on the farther side\r\nof the neck, and is pushed on until it can be felt at its lower border. The\r\nhand now seizes the knotted end of the cord beneath the lower border of the\r\nneck and pulls it through while the carrier is withdrawn, the cord sliding\r\nthrough its rings. The cord, pushed up as near to the head as possible, is\r\nfurnished with a running noose by tying the knotted end round the other,\r\nor, better, the two ends are twisted around each other so as to give a firm\r\nhold on the neck without dangerously compressing the blood vessels. By\r\npushing on the opposite shoulder with the repeller, and, assisting with the\r\nhand on shoulder, breastbone, or lower border of the neck, such a change of\r\nposition will be secured as will speedily bring the head within reach.\r\nAfterwards proceed as described above.\r\n\r\nThese cases are always trying, but it is very rarely necessary to resort to\r\nembryotomy. When absolutely required, first remove one fore limb, and then,\r\nif still unsuccessful, the other, after which the head can easily be\r\nsecured. (See \"Embryotomy,\" p. 202.)\r\n\r\n_Head turned upward and backward._--In this case the face rests upon the\r\nspine; the forefeet appear alone in the passage, but fail to advance, and\r\non examination the rounded, inferior border of the neck can be felt,\r\nextending upward and backward beneath the spine of the dam, and if the calf\r\nis not too large the hand may reach the lower jaw or even the muzzle. (Pl.\r\nXVI, fig. 5.) A repeller is planted in the breast and the body of the calf\r\npushed backward and downward so as to make room and bring the head nearer\r\nto the passage; or in some cases the body may be pushed back sufficiently\r\nby the use of the fore limbs alone. Meanwhile the head is seized by the ear\r\nor the eye socket, or, if it can be reached, by the lower jaw, and pulled\r\ndownward into position as space is obtained for it. If the hand alone is\r\ninsufficient, the blunt hooks may be inserted in the orbits or in the angle\r\nof the mouth, or a noose may be placed on the lower paw, and by traction\r\nthe head will be easily advanced. In case of a large fetus, the head of\r\nwhich is beyond reach, even when traction is made on the limbs, a rope may\r\nbe passed around the neck and pulled, while the breastbone is pressed\r\ndownward and backward by the repeller, and soon the change of position will\r\nbring the orbit or lower jaw within reach. With the above-described\r\nposition the standing position is most favorable for success, but if the\r\ncalf is placed with its back down toward the udder, and if the head is bent\r\ndown under the brim of the pelvis, the best position for the cow is on her\r\nback, with her head downhill.\r\n\r\nIn neglected cases, with death and putrefaction of the fetus and dryness of\r\nthe passages, it may be necessary to extract in pieces. (See \"Embryotomy,\"\r\np. 202.)\r\n\r\n_Outward direction of the stifles_--_Abduction of hind limbs._--As an\r\nobstacle to parturition, this is rare in cows. It is most liable to take\r\nplace in cows with narrow hip bones, and when the service has been made by\r\na bull having great breadth across the quarter. The calf, taking after the\r\nsire, presents an obstacle to calving in the breadth of its quarters, and\r\nif at the same time the toes and stifles are turned excessively outward and\r\nthe hocks inward the combined breadth of the hip bones above and the\r\nstifles below may be so great that the pelvis will not easily admit them.\r\nAfter the forefeet, head, and shoulders have all passed out through the\r\nvulva, further progress suddenly and unaccountably ceases, and some\r\ndragging on the parts already delivered does not serve to bring away the\r\nhind parts. The oiled hand introduced along the side of the calf will\r\ndiscover the obstacle in the stifle joints turned directly outward and\r\nprojecting on each side beyond the bones which circumscribe laterally the\r\nfront entrance of the pelvis. The evident need is to turn the stifles\r\ninward; this may be attempted by the hand introduced by the side of the\r\ncalf, which is meanwhile rotated gently on its own axis to favor the change\r\nof position. To correct the deviation of the hind limb is, however, very\r\ndifficult, as the limbs themselves are out of reach and can not be used as\r\nlevers to assist. If nothing can be done by pushing the body of the calf\r\nback and rotating it and by pressure by the hand in the passages, the only\r\nresort appears to be to skin the calf from the shoulder back, cut it in two\r\nas far back as can be reached, then push the buttocks well forward into the\r\nwomb, bring up the hind feet, and so deliver.\r\n\r\n_Hind limbs excessively bent on the body and engaged in the pelvis._--In\r\nthis case the presentation is apparently a normal, anterior one; fore limbs\r\nand head advanced naturally and the parturition proceeds until half the\r\nchest has passed through the external passages, when suddenly progress\r\nceases and no force will effect farther advance. An examination with the\r\noiled hand detects the presence, in the passages, of the hind feet and\r\nusually the hind legs up to above the hocks. (Pl. XVII, fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nThe indications for treatment are to return the hind limbs into the body of\r\nthe womb. If they have not advanced too far into the pelvis, this may be\r\ndone as follows: A rope with running noose is passed over each hind foot\r\nand drawn tight around the lower part of the hock; the ropes are then\r\npassed through the two rings in the small end of the rotating instrument\r\n(Pl. XX, fig. 5) which is slid into the passages until it reaches the\r\nhocks, when the ropes, drawn tight, are tied around the handle of the\r\ninstrument. Then in the intervals between the pains the hocks are pushed\r\nforcibly back into the womb. If by this means flexion can be effected in\r\nhocks and stifles, success will follow; the hind feet will pass into the\r\nwomb and clear of the brim of the pelvis and the body may now be advanced\r\nwithout hindrance, the hind limbs falling into place when the hip joints\r\nare extended. At the same time the pressure upon hind limbs must not be\r\nrelaxed until the buttocks are engaged in the pelvis, as otherwise the feet\r\nmay again get over the brim and arrest the progress of delivery.\r\n\r\nWhen the hind limbs are already so jammed into the pelvis that it is\r\nimpossible to return them, the calf must be sacrificed to save the mother.\r\nCords with running nooses are first put on the two hind feet. The body must\r\nbe skinned from the shoulders back as far as can be reached, and is to be\r\nthen cut in two, if possible, back of the last rib. The remainder of the\r\ntrunk is now pushed back into the body of the womb and by traction upon the\r\ncords the hind feet are brought up into the passages and the extraction\r\nwill be comparatively easy.\r\n\r\n_Hind presentation with one or both legs bent at the hock._--After the\r\nbursting of the water bags, though labor pains continue, no part of the\r\nfetus appears at the vulva unless it be the end of the tail. On examination\r\nthe buttocks are felt wedged against the spine at the entrance of the\r\npelvis and beneath them the bent hock joints resting on the brim of the\r\npelvis below. (Pl. XVII, fig. 3.) The calf has been caught by the labor\r\npains while the limb was bent beneath it and has been jammed into or\r\nagainst the rim of the pelvis, so that extension of the limb became\r\nimpossible. With the thigh bent on the flank, the leg on the thigh, and the\r\nshank on the leg, and all at once wedged into the passage, delivery is\r\npractically impossible.\r\n\r\nThe obvious remedy is to push the croup upward and forward and extend the\r\nhind legs, and in the early stages this can usually be accomplished in the\r\ncow. A repeller (Pl. XX, fig. 7) is planted across the thighs and pointed\r\nupward toward the spine of the cow and pushed forcibly in this direction\r\nduring the intervals between labor pains. Meanwhile the oiled hand seizes\r\nthe shank just below the hock and uses it as a lever, pushing the body back\r\nand drawing the foot forward, thus effectually seconding the action of the\r\nrepeller. Soon a distinct gain is manifest, and as soon as the foot can be\r\nreached it is bent back strongly at the fetlock, held in the palm of the\r\nhand, and pulled up, while the repeller, pressing on the buttocks, assists\r\nto make room for it. In this way the foot may be brought safely and easily\r\nover the brim of the pelvis without any risk of laceration of the womb of\r\nthe foot. After the foot has been lifted over the brim, the whole limb can\r\nbe promptly and easily extended. In cases presenting special difficulty in\r\nraising the foot over the brim, help may be had by traction on a rope\r\npassed around in front of the hock, and later still by a rope with a noose\r\nfastened to the pastern. In the worst cases, with the buttocks and hocks\r\nwedged deeply into the passages, it may prove difficult or impossible to\r\npush the buttocks back into the abdomen, and in such case the extension of\r\nthe hind limb is practically impossible without mutilation. In some roomy\r\ncows a calf may be dragged through the passages by ropes attached to the\r\nbent hocks, but even when this is possible there is great risk of\r\nlaceration of the floor of the vagina by the feet. The next resort is to\r\ncut the hamstring just above the point of the hock and the tendon on the\r\nfront of the limb (flexor metatarsi) just above the hock, and even the\r\nsinews behind the shank bone just below the hock. This allows the stifle\r\nand hock to move independently of each other, the one undergoing extension\r\nwithout entailing the extension of the other; it also allows both joints to\r\nflex completely, so that the impacted mass can pass through a narrower\r\nchannel. If now, by dragging on the hocks and operating with the repeller\r\non the buttocks, the latter can be tilted forward sufficiently to allow of\r\nthe extension of the stifle, the jam will be at once overcome, and the calf\r\nmay be extracted with the hock bent, but the stifle extended. If even this\r\ncan not be accomplished, it may now be possible to extract the whole mass\r\nwith both hocks and stifles fully bent. To attempt this, traction may be\r\nmade on the rope around the hocks and on a sharp hook (Pl. XX, fig. 2)\r\npassed forward between the thighs and hooked on to the brim of the pelvis.\r\nEverything else failing, the offending limb or limbs may be cut off at the\r\nhip joint and extracted, after which extraction may proceed by dragging on\r\nthe remaining limb, or by hooks on the hip bones. Very little is to be\r\ngained by cutting off the limb at the hock, and the stifle is less\r\naccessible than the hip, and amputation of the stifle gives much poorer\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_Hind limbs bent forward from the hip_--_Breech presentation._--This is an\r\nexaggeration of the condition last described, only the hocks and stifles\r\nare fully extended and the whole limb carried forward beneath the belly.\r\n(Pl. XVII, fig. 2.) The water bags appear and burst, but nothing presents\r\nunless it may be the tail. Examination in this case detects the outline of\r\nthe buttocks, with the tail and anus at its upper part.\r\n\r\nThe remedy, as in the case last described, consists in pushing the buttock\r\nupward and forward with a repeller, the cow being kept standing and headed\r\ndownhill until the thigh bone can be reached and used as a lever. Its upper\r\nend is pushed forward and its lower end raised until, the joints becoming\r\nfully flexed, the point of the hock can be raised above the brim of the\r\npelvis. If necessary a noose may be passed around the leg as far down\r\ntoward the hock as possible and pulled on forcibly, while the hand presses\r\nforward strongly on the back of the leg above. When both hocks have been\r\nlodged above the brim of the pelvis the further procedure is as described\r\nunder the last heading.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the case is advanced and the buttocks wedged firmly into the\r\npassages, it may be impossible safely to push the fetus back into the womb,\r\nand the calf must either be dragged through the passage as it is or the\r\nlimbs or the pelvis must be cut off. To extract successfully with a breech\r\npresentation the cow must be large and roomy and the calf not too large.\r\nThe first step in this case is to separate the pelvic bones on the two\r\nsides by cutting from before backward, exactly in the median line below and\r\nwhere the thighs come together above. This may be done with a strong\r\nembryotomy knife, but is most easily accomplished with the long embryotome\r\n(Pl. XX, fig. 3). The form which I have designed (Pl. XX, fig. 1), with a\r\nshort cutting branch jointed to the main stem, is to be preferred, as the\r\nshort cutting piece may be folded on the main stem so that its cutting edge\r\nwill be covered, and it can be introduced and extracted without danger.\r\nThis is pushed forward beneath the calf's belly, and the cutting arm\r\nopened, inserted in front of the brim of the pelvis and pulled forcibly\r\nback through the whole length of the pelvic bones. The divided edges are\r\nnow made to overlap each other and the breadth of the haunch is materially\r\nreduced. One end of the cord may then be passed forward by means of a cord\r\ncarrier (Pl. XXI, fig. 5) on the inner side of one thigh until it can be\r\nseized at the stifle by the hand passed forward on the outer side of that\r\nthigh. This end is now pulled back through the vagina, the other end passed\r\nthrough the cord carrier and passed forward on the inner side of the other\r\nthigh until it can be seized at the stifle by the hand passed forward\r\noutside that thigh. This end is drawn back through the vagina like the\r\nfirst, and is tied around the other so as to form a running noose. The rope\r\nis now drawn through the ring until it forms a tight loop, encircling the\r\nbelly just in front of the hind limbs. On this strong traction can be made\r\nwithout interfering with the full flexion of the limbs on the body, and if\r\nthe case is a suitable one, and the body of the fetus and the passages are\r\nboth well lubricated with oil or lard, a successful parturition may be\r\naccomplished. A less desirable method is to put a rope around one thigh or\r\na rope around each and drag upon these, but manifestly the strain is not so\r\ndirectly on the spine, and the limbs may be somewhat hampered in flexion.\r\n\r\nThis method being inapplicable, the next resort is to cut off one or both\r\nhind limbs at the hip joint. Free incisions are made on the side of the\r\nhaunch so as to expose the hip joint, and the muscles are cut away from the\r\nhead of the thigh bone down to its narrow neck, around which a rope is\r\npassed and firmly fixed with a running noose. The joint is now cut into all\r\naround, and while traction is made on the cord the knife is inserted into\r\nthe inner side of the joint and the round ligament severed. The cord may\r\nnow be dragged upon forcibly, and the muscles and other parts cut through\r\nas they are drawn tense, until finally the whole member has been extracted.\r\nTraction on the rope round the other thigh will now suffice to extract, in\r\nmost cases, but if it should fail the other limb may be cut off in the same\r\nmanner, and then hooks inserted in front of the brim of the pelvis or in\r\nthe openings in the bones of its floor (obturator foramina) will give\r\nsufficient purchase for extraction. Another method is to insert a knife\r\nbetween the bone of the rump (sacrum) and the hip bone and sever their\r\nconnections; then cut through the joint (symphysis) between the two hip\r\nbones in the median line of the floor of the pelvis, and then with a hook\r\nin the opening on the pelvic bones (obturator foramen) drag upon the limb\r\nand cut the tense soft parts until the limb is freed and extracted.\r\n\r\n_Presentation of the back._--In this presentation straining may be active,\r\nbut after the rupture of the water bags no progress is made, and the hand\r\nintroduced will recognize the back with its row of spinous processes and\r\nthe springing ribs at each side pressed against the entrance to the pelvis.\r\n(Pl. XVII, fig. 6.) The presence or absence of the ribs will show whether\r\nit is the region of the chest or the loins. By feeling along the line of\r\nspines until the ribs are met with we shall learn that the head lies in\r\nthat direction. If, on the contrary, we follow the ribs until they\r\ndisappear, and a blank space is succeeded by hip bones, it shows that we\r\nare approaching the tail. The head may be turned upward, downward, to the\r\nright side, or to the left.\r\n\r\nThe object must be to turn the fetus so that one extremity or the other can\r\nenter the passage, and the choice of which end to bring forward will depend\r\non various considerations. If one end is much nearer the outlet than the\r\nother, that would naturally be selected for extraction, but if they are\r\nequidistant the choice would fall on the hind end, as having only the two\r\nlimbs to deal with without any risk of complication from the head. When the\r\nhead is turned upward and forward it will usually be preferable to bring up\r\nthe hind limb, as, owing to the drooping of the womb into the abdomen,\r\nrotation of the fetus will usually be easier in that direction, and if\r\nsuccessful the resulting position will be a natural posterior presentation,\r\nwith the back of the calf turned toward the rump of the cow. Similarly with\r\nthe croup turned upward and forward, that should be pushed on forward, and\r\nif the forefeet and head can be secured it will be a natural anterior\r\npresentation, with the back of the calf turned upward toward the rump of\r\nthe cow.\r\n\r\nThe womb should be injected with warm water or oil, and the turning of the\r\ncalf will demand the combined action of the repeller and the hand, but in\r\nall such cases the operator has an advantage that the body of the fetus is\r\nwholly within the body of the womb, and therefore movable with comparative\r\nease. No part is wedged into the pelvic passages as a complication. The\r\ngeneral principles are the same as in faulty presentation fore and hind,\r\nand no time should be lost in making the manipulations necessary to bring\r\nthe feet into the pelvis, lest they get inbent or otherwise displaced and\r\nadd unnecessary complications.\r\n\r\nWith a transverse direction of the calf, the head being turned to one side,\r\nthe pressure must be directed laterally, so that the body will glide around\r\non one side of the womb, and the extremities when reached must be promptly\r\nseized and brought into the passages. Sometimes a fortunate struggle of a\r\nlive fetus will greatly aid in rectifying the position.\r\n\r\n_Breast and abdomen presented._--All four feet in the passages._--In this\r\nform the calf lies across the womb with its roached back turned forward and\r\nits belly toward the pelvis. All four feet may be extended and engaged in\r\nthe passages, or one or more may be bent on themselves so as to lie in\r\nfront of the pelvis. The head, too, may usually be felt on the right side\r\nor the left, and if detected it serves to identify the exact position of\r\nthe fetus. The position may further be decided upon by examination of the\r\nfeet and limbs. With the limbs extended the front of the hoofs and the\r\nconvex aspect of the bent pasterns and fetlocks will look toward that flank\r\nin which lie the head and shoulders. On examination still higher the\r\nsmooth, even outline of the knee and its bend, looking toward the hind\r\nparts, characterize the fore limb, while the sharp prominence of the point\r\nof the hock and the bend on the opposite side of the joint, looking toward\r\nthe head, indicate the hind limb. (Pl. XVII, fig. 5.)\r\n\r\nThe remedy of this condition is to be sought in repelling into the womb\r\nthose limbs that are least eligible for extraction, and bringing into the\r\npassages the most eligible extremities. The most eligible will usually be\r\nthose which project farthest into the passages, indicating the nearer\r\nproximity of that end of the calf. An exception may, however, be made in\r\nfavor of that extremity which will give the most natural presentation. Thus\r\nif, owing to obliquity in the position of the fetus, the hind extremities\r\npromised a presentation with the back of the fetus turned down toward the\r\nudder, and the anterior extremities one with the back turned up toward the\r\nspine, the latter should be selected. Again, if the choice for the two\r\nextremities is evenly balanced, the hind may be chosen as offering less\r\nrisk of complication, there being no head to get displaced.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the treatment is to place a running noose on each of the\r\nfour feet, marking those of the fore limbs to distinguish them from those\r\nof the hind ones. In case it is proposed to bring the anterior extremities\r\ninto the passage, a noose should also be placed on the lower jaw. Then run\r\nthe ropes attached to the two feet that are to be pushed back through the\r\nring of a cord carrier (Pl. XXI, fig. 5), passing the rings down to the\r\nfeet, and by the aid of the carrier push them well back into the womb and\r\nhold them there. Meanwhile drag upon the ropes attached to the two other\r\nfeet so as to bring them into the passage (or, in case of the anterior\r\nextremity, on the two foot ropes and the head one). The other feet must be\r\npushed back into the womb until the body of the calf is fully engaged in\r\nthe passages. After this they can no longer find an entrance, but must\r\nfollow as the body escapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGLECTED AND AGGRAVATED CASES.\r\n\r\nIn laying down the foregoing rules for giving assistance in critical cases\r\nof calving it is not intimated that all cases and stages can be\r\nsuccessfully dealt with. Too often assistance is not sought for many hours\r\nor even days after labor pains, and the escape of the waters intimate the\r\ndanger of delay. Not seldom the long delay has been filled up with\r\nunintelligent and injurious attempts at rendering assistance, violent\r\npulling when resistance is insurmountable without change of position,\r\ninjuries to the vagina and womb by ill-considered but too forcibly executed\r\nattempts to change the position, the repeated and long-continued contact\r\nwith rough hands and rougher ropes and hooks, the gashes with knives and\r\nlacerations with instruments in ignorant hands, the infecting material\r\nintroduced on filthy hands and instruments, and the septic inflammations\r\nstarted in the now dry and tender passages and womb. Not infrequently the\r\ndeath, putrefaction, and bloating of the calf in the womb render the case\r\nextremely unpromising and make it impossible to apply successfully many of\r\nthe measures above recommended. The labor pains of the cow may have\r\npractically ceased from exhaustion; the passages of the vagina may be so\r\ndry, tender, friable, red, and swollen that it requires considerable effort\r\neven to pass the oiled hand through them, and the extraction of the calf or\r\nany portion of it through such a channel seems a hopeless task; the womb\r\nmay be equally dry, inflamed and swollen, so that its lining membrane or\r\neven its entire thickness is easily torn; the fetal membranes have lost\r\ntheir natural, unctuous and slippery character, and cling firmly to the dry\r\nwalls of the womb, to the dry skin of the calf, or to the hands of the\r\noperator; the dead and putrefying calf may be so bloated with gases that\r\nthe womb has been overdistended by its presence, and the two adhere so\r\nclosely that the motion of the one on the other is practically impossible.\r\nIn other cases reckless attempts to cut the calf in pieces have left raw\r\nsurfaces with projecting bones which dangerously scratch and tear the womb\r\nand passages.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the extreme resort must be had of cutting the fetus to pieces\r\n(embryotomy), or the still more redoubtable one of CÊsarean section\r\n(extraction through the flank).\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSECTION OF THE UNBORN CALF (EMBRYOTOMY).\r\n\r\nIn some cases the dissection of the calf is the only feasible means of\r\ndelivering it through the natural passages; and while it is especially\r\napplicable to the dead calf, it is also on occasion called for in the case\r\nof the living. As a rule, the living calf should be preserved, if possible,\r\nbut if this threatens to entail the death of the cow it is only in the case\r\nof offspring of rare value that its preservation is to be preferred. To\r\nthose acquainted with the toil, fatigue, and discomfort of embryotomy, no\r\ndiscussion is necessary so long as there is a prospect of success from the\r\nsimple and generally easier method of rectifying the faulty position of the\r\ncalf. When the correction of the position is manifestly impossible,\r\nhowever, when distortions and monstrosities of the fetus successfully\r\nobstruct delivery, when the pelvic passages are seriously contracted by\r\nfractures and bony growths, when the passages are virtually almost closed\r\nby swelling, or when the calf is dead and excessively swollen, no other\r\nresort may be available. In many cases of distortion and displacement the\r\ndismemberment of the entire calf is unnecessary, the removal of the\r\noffending member being all that is required. It will be convenient,\r\ntherefore, to describe the various suboperations one by one and in the\r\norder in which they are usually demanded.\r\n\r\n_Amputation of the fore limb._--In cutting off a fore limb it is the one\r\npresenting that should be selected, since it is much more easily operated\r\non, and its complete removal from the side of the chest affords so much\r\nmore space for manipulation that it often makes it easy to bring the other\r\nmissing limb or the head into position. The first consideration is to skin\r\nthe limb from the fetlock up and leave the skin attached to the body. The\r\nreasons for this are: (_a_) That the skin is the most resistant structure\r\nof the limb, and when it has been removed the entire limb can be easily\r\ndetached; (_b_) the tough skin left from the amputated limb may be used as\r\na cord in subsequent traction on the body of the calf; (_c_) the dissection\r\nand separation of the limb are far more safely accomplished under the\r\nprotection of the enveloping skin than if the operator's hands and\r\ninstruments were in direct contact with the walls of the passages or womb;\r\n(_d_) the dissection can be much more easily effected while the skin is\r\nstretched by the left hand, so as to form a comparatively firmer resistant\r\npoint for the knife, than when it is attempted to cut the soft, yielding,\r\nand elastic tissues which naturally offer little solid resistance, but\r\nconstantly recede before the cutting edge of the instrument. The\r\npreservation of the skin is therefore a cardinal principle in the\r\namputation of all parts in which it is at all feasible.\r\n\r\nThe presenting foot is inclosed in a noose and drawn well out of the\r\npassages. Then a circular incision through the skin is made around the limb\r\njust above the fetlock. From this the skin is slit up on the inner side of\r\nthe limb to the breast. Then the projecting part of the limb is skinned up\r\nto the vulva, traction being made on the foot by an assistant so as to\r\nexpose as much as possible. The embryotomy knife may now be taken (Pl. XXI,\r\nfig. 2), and a small hole having been cut in the free end of the detached\r\nportion of skin, that is seized by the left hand and extended while its\r\nfirm connections with the deeper structures are cut through. The looser\r\nconnections can be more quickly torn through with the closed fist or the\r\ntips of the four fingers held firmly together in a line or with the spud,\r\nof which there are several kinds. Much of the upper part of the limb can be\r\nskinned more speedily without the knife, but that must be resorted to to\r\ncut across tough bands whenever these interrupt the progress. The skinning\r\nshould be carried upward on the outer side of the shoulder blade to the\r\nspine or nearly so. Then with the knife the muscles attaching the elbow and\r\nshoulder to the breastbone are cut across, together with those on the inner\r\nside of the shoulder joint and in front and behind it as far as these can\r\nbe reached. Steady traction is now made upon the foot, the remaining\r\nmuscles attaching the shoulder blade to the trunk are torn through with a\r\ncracking noise, and the whole limb, including the shoulder blade and its\r\ninvesting muscles, comes away. If the shoulder blade is left the bulk of\r\nthe chest is not diminished, and nothing has been gained. Before going\r\nfurther it is well to see whether the great additional space thus secured\r\nin the passages will allow of the missing limb or head to be brought into\r\nposition. If not, the other presenting part, limb or head, is to be\r\namputated and extracted. For the limb the procedure is a repetition of that\r\njust described.\r\n\r\n_Amputation of the head._--The head is first seized and drawn well forward,\r\nor even outside the vulva, by a rope with a running noose placed around the\r\nlower jaw just behind the incisor teeth, by a sharp hook inserted in the\r\narch of the lower jaw behind the union of its two branches and back of the\r\nincisor teeth, or by hooks inserted in the orbits, or, finally, in case the\r\nwhole head protrudes, by a halter. (Pl. XXI, figs 4_a_ and 4_b._) In case\r\nthe whole head protrudes, a circular incision through the skin is made just\r\nback of the ear, and the cut edge being held firmly by the left hand, the\r\nneck is skinned as far as it can be reached. Then the great ligamentous\r\ncord above the spine is cut across at the farthest available point,\r\ntogether with the muscles above and below the spine. Strong traction on the\r\nhead will then detach it at this point and bring it away, but should there\r\nstill be too much resistance the knife is inserted between the bodies of\r\ntwo vertebrÊ just behind one of the prominent points felt in the median\r\nline below, and their connecting fibrous cartilage is cut through, after\r\nwhich comparatively moderate pulling will bring it away. The detached neck\r\nand body at once slip back into the womb, and if the fore limbs are now\r\nbrought up and pulled they are advanced so far upon the chest that the\r\ntransverse diameter of that is greatly diminished and delivery\r\ncorrespondingly facilitated.\r\n\r\nIf the head is still inclosed in the vagina two methods are available: (1)\r\nThe removal of the lower jaw and subsequent separation of the head from the\r\nneck; (2) the skinning of the whole head and its separation from the neck.\r\n\r\nTo remove the lower jaw the skin is dissected away from it until the throat\r\nis reached. Then the muscles of the cheeks and side of the jaw (masseters)\r\nare cut through and those connecting the jaw with the neck. When traction\r\nis made on the rope around the lower jaw it will usually come away with\r\nlittle trouble. Should it resist, its posterior extremity on each side\r\n(behind the grinding teeth) may be cut through with bone forceps or with a\r\nguarded bone chisel. (Pl. XX, fig. 8.) After the removal of the lower jaw\r\nthe way will be open to separate the head from the neck, the knife being\r\nused to cut into the first or second joint from below, or the bone forceps\r\nor chisel being employed to cut through the bones of the neck. Then\r\ntraction is made on the head by means of hooks in the orbits, and the hand,\r\narmed with an embryotomy knife, is introduced to cut through the tense\r\nresisting ligament, and muscles above the bones. The skin and the strong\r\nligamentous cord attached to the poll are the essential things to cut, as\r\nthe muscles can easily be torn across. Unless there are great difficulties\r\nin the way it is well to skin the head from the eyes back, and on reaching\r\nthe poll to cut through the ligament and then bring the head away by\r\npulling.\r\n\r\nIf it is decided to remove the entire head at once, it may be skinned from\r\nthe front of the eyes back to behind the lower jaw below and the poll\r\nabove, then cut through the muscles and ligaments around the first joint\r\nand pull the head away, assisting, if need be, in the separation of the\r\nhead by using the knife on the ligament of the joint.\r\n\r\nIf the calf is a double-headed monster, the skinning of the head must be\r\ncarried backward until the point has been reached where both heads branch\r\nfrom the single neck, and the separation must be made at that point. The\r\nmuscles and ligaments are first to be cut through; and if the part can not\r\nthen be detached by pulling, the bodies of the vertebrÊ may be separated by\r\npassing the knife through the joint. The second head may now be secured by\r\na noose around the lower jaw or hooks in the orbits and brought up into\r\nplace, the body being pushed back toward the other side by a repeller, so\r\nas to make room.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that, except in the case of a double-headed monster, or\r\nin case of the head protruding or nearly so, and one or both fore limbs\r\npresenting, it is rarely desirable to undertake amputation of the head. The\r\nspace desirable in the passages can usually be obtained by the much simpler\r\nand easier procedure of removing one or both fore limbs.\r\n\r\n_Amputation of the hind limbs._--This is sometimes demanded on the one\r\nextended limb when the other can not be brought up and delivery can not be\r\neffected; also in case of monsters having extra hind limbs; when the calf\r\nis dead, putrid, and bloated with gas; and in some cases of breech\r\npresentation, as described under that head.\r\n\r\nWhen the limb is extended the guiding principles are as in the case of the\r\nfore limbs. The skin is cut through circularly above the fetlock and slit\r\nup to beneath the pelvic bones on the inner side of the thigh. It is then\r\ndissected from the other parts as high as it has been slit on the inner\r\nside and to above the prominence (_trochanter major_) on the upper end of\r\nthe thigh bone on the outer side of the joint. In this procedure the hands\r\nand spud can do much, but owing to the firmer connections the knife will be\r\nmore frequently required than in the case of the fore limb. The muscles are\r\nnow cut through all around the hip joint, and strong traction is made by\r\ntwo or three men on the limb. If there is still too much resistance, a\r\nknife is inserted into the joint on the inner side and its round ligament\r\ncut through, after which extraction will be comparatively easy. This\r\naccomplished, it will often be possible to extract the fetus with the other\r\nleg turned forward into the womb. If the calf is bloated with gas, it may\r\nbe necessary to remove the other leg in the same way, and even to cut open\r\nthe chest and abdomen and remove their contents before extraction can be\r\neffected. In the case of extra limbs it may be possible to bring them up\r\ninto the passages after the presenting hind limbs have been removed. If\r\nthis is not practicable, they may be detached by cutting them through at\r\nthe hip joint, as described under \"Breech presentation,\" page 197.\r\n\r\nAnother method of removing the hind limb is, after having skinned it over\r\nthe quarter, to cut through the pelvic bones from before backward, in the\r\nmedian line below, by knife, saw, or long embryotome (Pl. XX, fig. 1), and\r\nthen disjoint the bones of the spine (sacrum) and the hip bone (ilium) on\r\nthat side with embryotome, knife, or saw, and then drag away the entire\r\nlimb, along with all the hip bones on that side. This has the advantage of\r\nsecuring more room and thereby facilitating subsequent operations. Both\r\nlimbs may be removed in this way, but on the removal of the second the\r\noperator is without any solid point to drag upon in bringing away the\r\nremainder of the fetus.\r\n\r\n_Division across the middle of the body._--In cases of extra size,\r\nmonstrosity, or distortion of one end of the body it may be requisite to\r\ncut the body in two and return the half from the passages into womb, even\r\nafter one-half has been born. The presenting members are dragged upon\r\nforcibly by assistants to bring as much of the body as possible outside.\r\nThen cut through the skin around the body at some distance from the vulva,\r\nand with hand, knife, and spud detach it from the trunk as far back into\r\nthe passages as can be reached. Next cut across the body at the point\r\nreached, beginning at the lower part (breast, belly) and proceeding up\r\ntoward the spine. This greatly favors the separation of the backbone when\r\nreached, and further allows of its being extended so that it can be divided\r\nhigher up. When the backbone is reached, the knife is passed between the\r\ntwo bones, the prominent ridges across their ends acting as guides, and by\r\ndragging and twisting the one is easily detached from the other. With an\r\nanterior presentation the separation should, if possible, be made behind\r\nthe last rib, while with a posterior presentation as many of the ribs\r\nshould be brought away as can be accomplished. Having removed one half of\r\nthe body, the remaining half is to be pushed back into the womb, the feet\r\nsought and secured with nooses, and the second half removed in one piece if\r\npossible; and if not, then after the removal of the extra limb or other\r\ncause of obstruction.\r\n\r\n_Removed of the contents of chest or abdomen._--If the body of the calf\r\nsticks fast in the passages by reason of the mere dryness of its skin and\r\nof the passages, the obstacle may be removed by injecting sweet oil past\r\nthe fetus into the womb through a rubber or other tube, and smearing the\r\npassages freely with lard. When the obstruction depends on excess of size\r\nof the chest or abdomen or thickening of the body from distorted spine,\r\nmuch advantage may be derived from the removal of the contents of these\r\ngreat cavities of the trunk. We have already seen how the haunches may be\r\nnarrowed by cutting the bones apart in the median line below and causing\r\ntheir free edges to overlap each other. The abdomen can be cut open by the\r\nembryotomy knife or the long embryotome in the median line, or at any\r\npoint, and the contents pulled out with the hand, the knife being used in\r\nany case when especial resistance is encountered. If the abdomen is so\r\nfirmly impacted that it can not be dealt within this way, one hind limb and\r\nthe hip bone on the same side may be removed as described under \"Amputation\r\nof the hind limbs,\" page 205. This will allow the introduction of the hand\r\ninto the abdomen from behind, so as to pull out the contents. By\r\nintroducing an embryotomy knife in the palm of the hand and cutting through\r\nthe muscle of the diaphragm the interior of the chest can be reached in the\r\nsame way and the heart and lungs removed.\r\n\r\nWhen, in dealing with an anterior presentation, it becomes necessary to\r\nremove the contents of the chest, the usual course is to cut through the\r\nconnections of the ribs with the breastbone (the costal cartilages) close\r\nto the breastbone on each side, and from the abdomen forward to the neck.\r\nThen cut through the muscles connecting the front of the breastbone with\r\nthe neck and its hinder end with the belly, and pull out the entire\r\nbreastbone. Having torn out the heart and lungs with the hand, make the rib\r\ncartilages on the one side overlap those on the other, so as to lessen the\r\nthickness of the chest, and proceed to extract the body. If it seems\r\nneedful to empty the abdomen as well, it is easy to reach it by cutting\r\nthrough the diaphragm, which separates it from the chest.\r\n\r\n_Delivery through the flank_ (_CÊsarean section, or laparotomy_).--This is\r\nsometimes demanded, when the distortion and narrowing of the hip bones are\r\nsuch as to forbid the passage of the calf, or when inflammation has\r\npractically closed the natural passages and the progeny is more valuable\r\nand worthy of being saved than the dam; also in cases in which the cow has\r\nbeen fatally injured, or is ill beyond possibility of recovery and yet\r\ncarries a living calf. It is too often a last resort after long and\r\nfruitless efforts to deliver by the natural channels, and in such cases the\r\nsaving of the calf is all that can be expected, the exhausted cow, already\r\nthe subject of active inflammation and too often also of putrid poisoning,\r\nis virtually beyond hope. The hope of saving the dam is greatest if she is\r\nin good health and not fatigued, in cases, for example, in which the\r\noperation is resorted to on account of broken hip bones or abnormally\r\nnarrow passages.\r\n\r\nThe stock owner will not attempt such a serious operation as this. Yet, if\r\nthe mother has just died or is to be immediately sacrificed, no one should\r\nhesitate to resort to it in order to save the calf. If alive, it is\r\nimportant to have the cow perfectly still. Her left fore leg being bent at\r\nthe knee by one person, another may seize the left horn and nose and turn\r\nthe head to the right until the nose rests on the spine just above the\r\nshoulder. The cow will sink down gently on her left side without shock or\r\nstruggle. One may now hold the head firmly to the ground, while a second,\r\ncarrying the end of the tail from behind forward on the inside of the right\r\nthigh, pulls upon it so as to keep the right hind limb well raised from the\r\nground. If time presses she may be operated on in this position, or if the\r\ncow is to be sacrificed a blow on the head with an ax will produce\r\nquietude. Then the prompt cutting into the abdomen and womb and the\r\nextraction of the calf requires no skill. If, however, the cow is to be\r\npreserved, her two forefeet and the lower hind one should be safely\r\nfastened together and the upper hind one drawn back. Two ounces chloral\r\nhydrate, given by injection, should induce sleep in 20 minutes, and the\r\noperation may proceed. In case the cow is to be preserved, wash the right\r\nflank and apply a solution of 4 grains of corrosive sublimate in a pint of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThen, with an ordinary scalpel or knife, dipped in the above-mentioned\r\nsolution, make an incision from 2 inches below and in front of the outer\r\nangle of the hip bone in a direction downward and slightly forward to a\r\ndistance of 12 inches. Cut through the muscles, and more carefully through\r\nthe transparent lining membrane of the abdomen (peritoneum), letting the\r\npoint of the knife lie in the groove between the first two fingers of the\r\nleft hand as they are slid down inside the membrane and with their back to\r\nthe intestines. An assistant, whose hands, like those of the operator, have\r\nbeen dipped in the sublimate solution, may press his hands on the wound\r\nbehind the knife to prevent the protrusion of the intestines. The operator\r\nnow feels for and brings up to the wound the gravid womb, allowing it to\r\nbulge well through the abdominal wound, so as to keep back the bowels and\r\nprevent any escape of water into the abdomen. This is seconded by two\r\nassistants, who press the lips of the wound against the womb. Then an\r\nincision 12 inches long is made into the womb at its most prominent point,\r\ndeep enough to penetrate its walls, but not so as to cut into the water\r\nbags. In cutting, carefully avoid the cotyledons, which may be felt as hard\r\nmasses inside. By pressure the water bags may be made to bulge out as in\r\nnatural parturition, and this projecting portion may be torn or cut so as\r\nto let the liquid flow down outside of the belly. The operator now plunges\r\nhis hand into the womb, seizes the fore or hind limbs, and quickly extracts\r\nthe calf and gives it to an attendant to convey to a safe place. The womb\r\nmay be drawn out, but not until all the liquid has flowed out, and the\r\nfetal membranes must be separated from the natural cotyledons, one by one,\r\nand the membranes removed. The womb is now emptied with a sponge, which has\r\nbeen boiled or squeezed out of a sublimate solution, and if any liquid has\r\nfallen into the abdomen it may be removed in the same way. A few stitches\r\nare now placed in the wound in the womb, using carbolized catgut. They need\r\nnot be very close together, as the wound will diminish greatly when the\r\nwomb contracts. Should the womb not contract at once it may have applied\r\nagainst it a sponge squeezed out of a cold sublimate solution, or it may be\r\ndrawn out of the abdominal wound and exposed to the cold air until it\r\ncontracts. Its contraction is necessary to prevent bleeding from its\r\nenormous network of veins. When contracted, the womb is returned into the\r\nabdomen and the abdominal wound sewed up. One set of stitches, to be placed\r\nat intervals of 2 inches, is passed through the entire thickness of skin\r\nand muscles and tied around two quills or little rollers resting on the\r\nskin. (Pl. XXVII, fig. 7.) These should be of silver, and may be cut at one\r\nend and pulled out after the wound has healed. The superficial stitches are\r\nput in every half inch and passed through the skin only. They, too, may be\r\nof silver, or pins may be inserted through the lips and a fine cord twisted\r\nround their ends like a figure 8. (Pl. XXVII, fig. 9.) The points of the\r\npins may be snipped off with pliers. The edges may be still further held\r\ntogether by the application of Venice turpentine, melted so as to become\r\nfirmly adherent, and covered with a layer of sterilized cotton wool. Then\r\nthe whole should be supported by a bandage fixed around the loins and\r\nabdomen.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE GENERATIVE ORGANS.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATE XII. Fetal calf within its membranes (at mid term). The uterus is\r\nopened on the left side. In the uterus the fetus is surrounded by several\r\nmembranes which are known as the amnion or inner layer, the allantois or\r\ncentral layer, and the chorion or outer layer. The amnion is nearest the\r\nfetus and forms a closed sac around it filled with a fluid known as liquor\r\namnii, in which the fetus floats. The allantois is composed of two layers,\r\nwhich form a closed sac in connection with the urachus, or the tube which\r\nextends from the fetal bladder through the umbilical cord. The one layer of\r\nthe allantois is spread over the outer surface of the amnion and the other\r\nover the inner surface of chorion. The allantois also contains a fluid\r\nwhich is known as the allantoid liquid. The chorion is the outer envelope\r\nor membrane of the fetus, completely inclosing the fetus with its other\r\nmembranes. On the outer surface of this membrane are found the fetal\r\nplacentulÊ, or cotyledons, which, through their attachment to the maternal\r\ncotyledons, furnish the fetus with the means of sustaining life. The\r\nrelation of the fetal and maternal cotyledons to each other is illustrated\r\non the following plate.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII. Pregnant uterus with cotyledons.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.

A portion of the uterus (_A_) is shown with the maternal\r\ncotyledon (_BB_) attached to it. The fetal portion (_D_) consists of a mass\r\nof very minute hairlike processes on the chorion (_E_), which fit into\r\ncorresponding depressions or pits of the maternal portion. Each portion is\r\nabundantly supplied with blood vessels, so that a ready interchange of\r\nnutritive fluid may take place between mother and fetus.\r\n\r\nPLATE XIV.

S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University._\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOODING (BLEEDING FROM THE WOMB).\r\n\r\nThough not so common in the cow as in the human female, flooding is\r\nsufficiently frequent to demand attention. It may depend on a too rapid\r\ncalving and a consequent failure of the womb to contract when the calf has\r\nbeen removed. The pregnant womb is extraordinarily rich in blood vessels,\r\nespecially in large and tortuous veins, which become compressed and almost\r\nobliterated under contraction, but remain overfilled and often bleed into\r\nthe cavity of the womb should no contraction take place. Cox records cases\r\nin which the labor pains had detached and expelled the fetal membranes,\r\nwhile the calf, owing to large size or wrong presentation, was detained in\r\nthe womb, and the continued dilatation of the womb in the absence of the\r\nfetal membranes led to a flow of blood which accumulated in clots around\r\nthe calf. Other causes are laceration of the cotyledons of the womb, or\r\nfrom an antecedent inflammation of the placenta, and the unnatural adhesion\r\nof the membranes to the womb, which bleeds when the two are torn apart.\r\nWeakness of the womb from overdistention, as in dropsy, twins, etc., is not\r\nwithout its influence. Finally, eversion of the womb (casting the withers)\r\nis an occasional cause of flooding. The trouble is only too evident when\r\nthe blood flows from the external passages in drops or in a fine stream.\r\nWhen it is retained in the cavity of the womb, however, it may remain\r\nunsuspected until it has rendered the animal almost bloodless. The symptoms\r\nin such case are paleness of the eyes, nose, mouth, and of the lips of the\r\nvulva, a weak, rapid pulse, violent and perhaps loud beating of the heart\r\n(palpitations), sunken, staring eyes, coldness of the skin, ears, horns,\r\nand limbs, perspiration, weakness in standing, staggering gait, and,\r\nfinally, inability to rise, and death in convulsions. If these symptoms are\r\nseen, the oiled hand should be introduced into the womb, which will be\r\nfound open and flaccid and containing large blood clots.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in the removal of the fetal membranes and\r\nblood clots from the womb (which will not contract while they are present),\r\nthe dashing of cold water on the loins, right flank, and vulva, and if\r\nthese measures fail, the injection of cold water into the womb through a\r\nrubber tube furnished with a funnel. In obstinate cases a good-sized sponge\r\nsoaked in tincture of muriate of iron should be introduced into the womb\r\nand firmly squeezed, so as to bring the iron into contact with the bleeding\r\nsurface. This is at once an astringent and a coagulant for the blood,\r\nbesides stimulating the womb to contraction. In the absence of this agent\r\nastringents (solution of copperas, alum, tannic acid, or acetate of lead)\r\nmay be thrown into the womb, and one-half-dram doses of acetate of lead may\r\nbe given by the mouth, or 1 ounce powdered ergot of rye may be given in\r\ngruel. When nothing else is at hand, an injection of oil of turpentine will\r\nsometimes promptly check the bleeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERSION OF THE WOMB (CASTING THE WITHERS).\r\n\r\nLike flooding, this is the result of failure of the womb to contract after\r\ncalving. If that organ contracts naturally, the afterbirth is expelled, the\r\ninternal cavity of the womb is nearly closed, and the mouth of the organ\r\nbecomes so narrow that the hand can not be forced through, much less the\r\nwhole mass of the matrix. When, however, it fails to contract, the closed\r\nend of one of the horns may fall into its open internal cavity, and under\r\nthe compression of the adjacent intestines, and the straining and\r\ncontraction of the abdominal walls, it is forced farther and farther, until\r\nthe whole organ is turned outside in, slides back through the vagina, and\r\nhangs from the vulva. The womb can be instantly distinguished from the\r\nprotruding vagina or bladder by the presence, over its whole surface, of 50\r\nto 100 mushroomlike bodies (cotyledons), each 2 to 3 inches in diameter,\r\nand attached by a narrow neck. (Pls. XII, XIII.) When fully everted, it is\r\nfurther recognizable by a large, undivided body hanging from the vulva, and\r\ntwo horns or divisions which hang down toward the hocks. In the imperfect\r\neversions the body of the womb may be present with two depressions leading\r\ninto the two horns. In the cases of some standing the organ has become\r\ninflamed and gorged with blood until it is as large as a bushel basket, its\r\nsurface has a dark-red, bloodlike hue, and tears and bleeds on the\r\nslightest touch. Still later lacerations, raw sores, and even gangrene are\r\nshown in the mass. At the moment of protrusion the general health is not\r\naltered, but soon the inflammation and fever with the violent and continued\r\nstraining induce exhaustion, and the cow lies down, making no attempt to\r\nrise.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment varies somewhat, according to the degree of the\r\neversion. In partial eversion, with the womb protruding only slightly from\r\nthe vulva and the cow standing, let an assistant pinch the back to prevent\r\nstraining while the operator pushes his closed fist into the center of the\r\nmass and carries it back through the vagina, assisting in returning the\r\nsurrounding parts by the other hand. In more complete eversion, but with\r\nthe womb as yet of its natural bulk and consistency and the cow standing,\r\nstraining being checked by pinching the back, a sheet is held by two men so\r\nas to sustain the everted womb and raise it to the level of the vulva. It\r\nis now sponged clean with cold water, the cold being useful in driving out\r\nthe blood and reducing the bulk, and finally it may be sponged over with\r\nlaudanum or with a weak solution of carbolic acid (1 dram to 1 quart\r\nwater).\r\n\r\nThe closed fist may now be planted in the rounded end of the largest horn\r\nand pushed on so as to turn it back within itself and carry it on through\r\nthe vagina, the other hand being used meanwhile to assist in the inversion\r\nand in pushing the different masses in succession within the lips of the\r\nvulva. In case of failure, resort should be had at once to a plan which I\r\nhave successfully followed for many years. Take a long linen or cotton\r\nbandage, 5 or 6 inches wide, and wind it around the protruding womb as\r\ntightly as it can be drawn, beginning at the free end and gradually\r\ncovering the entire mass up to the vulva. By this means the greater part of\r\nthe blood will be forced out of the organ and its bulk greatly reduced, so\r\nthat its reduction is much facilitated. An additional advantage is found in\r\nthe protection given to the womb by its investing bandage while it is being\r\npushed forward into the vagina and abdomen. In manipulating the exposed\r\nwomb there is always danger of laceration, but when the organ is covered\r\nwith a sheet it is next to impossible to tear it. The subsequent\r\nmanipulation is as in the other case, by pushing the blind end forward\r\nwithin itself with the closed fist and carrying this on through the vagina\r\ninto the abdomen with the constant assistance of the other hand. Often it\r\nwill be found convenient to use the edge of the left hand to push the outer\r\npart of the protruding mass inside the lips of the vulva, while the right\r\nhand and arm are carrying the central portions forward through the vagina.\r\nAn intelligent assistant, pushing with the palms of both hands on the outer\r\nportion of the mass, will also afford material assistance. As the womb is\r\nturned within itself the wrapping bandage will gradually loosen, but once\r\nthe great mass has entered the passages it is easy to compel the rest to\r\nfollow, and the compression by the bandage is no longer so important. When\r\nthe womb is fully replaced the bandage is left in its interior in a series\r\nof loose folds, and can be easily withdrawn. It is well to move the hand\r\nfrom side to side to insure that the two horns of the womb are fully\r\nextended and on about the same level before withdrawing the arm and\r\napplying a truss.\r\n\r\nWhen the womb has been long everted and is gorged with blood, inflamed, and\r\nfriable there is often the additional disadvantage that the animal is\r\nunable or unwilling to rise. When lying down the straining can not be\r\ncontrolled so effectually, and, even in the absence of straining, the\r\ncompression of the belly is so great as to prove a serious obstacle to\r\nreduction. The straining may be checked by 2 or 3 ounces of laudanum or 2\r\nounces of chloral hydrate, or by inhalation of chloroform to insensibility,\r\nand then by raising the hind parts on straw bundles the gravitation of the\r\nabdominal organs forward may be made to lessen the resistance. If not\r\nsuccessful in this way, the cow may be further turned on her back, and if\r\nreturn is still impossible, the hind limbs may be tied together and drawn\r\nup to a beam overhead by the aid of a pulley. In this position, in place of\r\nthe pressure backward of the bowels proving a hindrance, their gravitation\r\nforward proves a most material help to reduction. In seeking to return the\r\nwomb the sponging with ice-cold water, raising on a sheet, and wrapping in\r\na tight bandage should be resorted to. Another method which is especially\r\ncommendable in these inflamed conditions of the womb is to bring a piece of\r\nlinen sheet, 30 by 36 inches, under the womb, with its anterior border\r\nclose up to the vulva, then turn the posterior border upward and forward\r\nover the organ, and cross the two ends over this and over each other above.\r\nThe ends of the sheet are steadily drawn, so as to tighten its hold on the\r\nwomb, which is thus held on the level of the vulva or above, and cold water\r\nis constantly poured upon the mass. The reduction is further sought by\r\ncompression of the mass with the palms applied outside the sheet. Fifteen\r\nor twenty minutes are usually sufficient to cause the return of the womb,\r\nprovided straining is prevented by pinching the back, or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn old and aggravated cases, with the womb torn, bruised, or even\r\ngangrenous, the only resort is to amputate the entire mass. This is done by\r\ntying a strong, waxed cord around the protruding mass close to the vulva,\r\nwinding the cord around pieces of wood, so as to draw it as tightly as\r\npossible, cutting off the organ below this ligature, tying a thread on any\r\nartery that may still bleed, and returning the stump well into the vagina.\r\n\r\nRetention of the returned womb is the next point, and is most easily\r\naccomplished by a rope truss. Take two ropes, each about 18 feet long and\r\nan inch in thickness. Double each rope at its middle, and lay the one above\r\nthe other at the bend, so as to form an ovoid of about 8 inches in its long\r\ndiameter. Twist each end of the one rope twice around the other, so that\r\nthis ovoid will remain when they are drawn tight. (Pls. XXII and XXIII.)\r\nTie a strap or rope around the back part of the neck and a surcingle around\r\nthe body. Place the rope truss on the animal so that the ovoid ring will\r\nsurround the vulva, the two ascending ropes on the right and left of the\r\ntail and the two descending ones down inside the thighs on the right and\r\nleft of the udder. These descending ropes are carried forward on the sides\r\nof the body and tied to the surcingle and to the neck collar. The ascending\r\nropes proceed forward on the middle of the back, twisting over each other,\r\nand are tied to the surcingle and collar. The upper and lower ropes are\r\ndrawn so tightly that the rope ring is made to press firmly all around the\r\nvulva without risk of displacement. This should be worn for several days,\r\nuntil the womb shall have closed and all risk of further eversion is at an\r\nend. Variations of this device are found in the use of a narrow triangle of\r\niron applied around the vulva and fixed by a similar arrangement of ropes,\r\nsurcingle, and collar (Pl. XXIII, fig. 3), a common crupper similarly held\r\naround the vulva (Pl. XXII, fig. 1), stitches through the vulva, and wire\r\ninserted through the skin on the two hips (Pl. XXIII, fig. 2), so that they\r\nwill cross behind the vulva; also pessaries of various kinds should be\r\ninserted into the vagina. None of these devices, however, present any\r\nadvantage over the simple and comparatively painless rope truss described\r\nabove. Such additional precautions as keeping the cow in a stall higher\r\nbehind than in front, and seeing that the diet is slightly laxative and\r\nnonstimulating may be named. If straining is persistent, ounce doses of\r\nlaudanum may be used twice a day, and the same may be injected into the\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\nIf the womb has been cut off, injections of a solution of a teaspoonful of\r\ncarbolic acid in a quart of water should be used daily, or more frequently,\r\nuntil the discharge ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVERSION OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nA genuine eversion of the bladder is almost unknown in the cow, owing to\r\nthe extreme narrowness of its mouth. The protrusion of the bladder,\r\nhowever, through a laceration sustained in calving, in the floor of the\r\nvagina and its subsequent protrusion through the vulva, is sometimes met\r\nwith. In this case the protruding bladder contains urine; this can never be\r\nthe case in a real eversion, in which the inner surface of the bladder and\r\nthe openings of the ureters are both exposed outside the vulva. The\r\npresence of a bag containing water, which is connected with the floor of\r\nthe vagina, will serve to identify this condition. If the position of the\r\nbladder in the vulva renders it impracticable to pass a catheter to draw\r\noff the urine, pierce the organ with the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe, or\r\neven a very small trocar and cannula, and draw off the water, when it will\r\nbe found an easy matter to return the bladder to its place. The rent in the\r\nvagina can be stitched up, but as there would be risk in any subsequent\r\ncalving it is best to prepare the cow for the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE BLADDER.\r\n\r\nThis has been known to occur in protracted parturition when the fetus\r\nfinally passed while the bladder was full. The symptoms are those of\r\ncomplete suppression of urine and tenderness of the abdomen, with a steady\r\naccumulation of liquid, and fluctuation on handling its lower part. If the\r\nhand is introduced into the vagina it is felt to be hot and tender, and\r\nperhaps slightly swollen along its floor. As a final test, if the lower,\r\nfluctuating part of the abdomen is punctured with a hypodermic needle, a\r\nstraw-colored liquid of a urinous odor flows out. The condition has been\r\nconsidered as past hope. The only chance for recovery would be in opening\r\nthe abdomen, evacuating the liquid, and stitching up the rent in the\r\nbladder, but at such a season, and with inflammation already started, there\r\nwould be little to hope for.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUPTURE OF THE WOMB.\r\n\r\nWhen the womb has been rendered friable by disease rupture may occur in the\r\ncourse of the labor, but much more frequently it occurs from violence\r\nsustained in attempting assistance in difficult parturition. It is also\r\nliable to occur during eversion of the organ through efforts to replace it.\r\n\r\nIf it happens while the calf is still in the womb, it will usually bleed\r\nfreely and continuously until the fetus has been extracted, so that the\r\nwomb can contract on itself and expel its excess of blood. Another danger\r\nis that in case of a large rent the calf may escape into the cavity of the\r\nabdomen and parturition become impossible. Still another danger is that of\r\nthe introduction of septic germs and the setting up of a fatal inflammation\r\nof the lining membrane of the belly (peritoneum). Still another is the\r\nescape of the small intestine through the rent and on through the vagina\r\nand vulva, so as to protrude externally and receive perhaps fatal injuries.\r\nIn case of rupture before calving, that act should be completed as rapidly\r\nand carefully as possible, the fetal membranes removed, and the contraction\r\nof the womb sought by dashing cold water on the loins, the right flank, or\r\nthe vulva. If the calf has escaped into the abdomen and can not be brought\r\nthrough the natural channels, it may be permissible to fix the animal and\r\nextract it through the side, as in the CÊsarian section. If the laceration\r\nhas happened during eversion of the womb it is usually less redoubtable,\r\nbecause the womb contracts more readily under the stimulus of the cold air\r\nso recently applied. In case the abdomen has been laid open it is well to\r\nstitch up the rent, but if not, it should be left to nature, and will often\r\nheal satisfactorily, the cow even breeding successfully in after years.\r\n\r\nRupture of the floor of the vagina has been already referred to as allowing\r\nthe protrusion of the bladder. Laceration of the roof of this passage is\r\nalso met with as the result of deviations of the hind limbs and feet upward\r\nwhen the calf lies on its back. In some such cases the opening passes clear\r\ninto the rectum, or the foot may even pass out through the anus, so that\r\nthat opening and the vulva are laid open into one.\r\n\r\nSimple, superficial lacerations of the vaginal walls are not usually\r\nserious, and heal readily unless septic inflammation sets in, in which case\r\nthe cow is liable to perish. They may be treated with soothing and\r\nantiseptic injections, such as carbolic acid, 1 dram; water, 1 quart.\r\n\r\nThe more serious injuries depend on the complications. Rupture of the\r\nanterior part of the canal, close to the mouth of the womb, may lead to the\r\nintroduction of infecting germs into the cavity of the abdomen, or\r\nprotrusion of the bowel through the rent and externally, either of which\r\nmay prove fatal. If both these conditions are escaped the wound may heal\r\nspontaneously. Rupture into the bladder may lead to nothing worse than a\r\nconstant dribbling of the urine from the vulva. The cow should be fattened\r\nif she survives. Rupture into the rectum will entail a constant escape of\r\nfeces through the vulva, and, of course, the same condition exists when the\r\nanus as well has been torn open. I have successfully sewed up an opening of\r\nthis kind in the mare, but in the case of the cow it is probably better to\r\nprepare her for the butcher.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOTS OF BLOOD IN THE WALLS OF THE VAGINA.\r\n\r\nDuring calving the vagina may be bruised so as to cause escape of blood\r\nbeneath the mucous membrane and its coagulation into large bulging clots.\r\nThe vulva may appear swollen, and on separating its lips the mucous\r\nmembrane of the vagina is seen to be raised into irregular rounded\r\nswellings of a dark-blue or black color, and which pit on pressure of the\r\nfinger. If the accumulation of blood is not extensive it may be reabsorbed,\r\nbut if abundant it may lead to irritation and dangerous inflammation, and\r\nshould be incised with a lancet and the clots cleared out. The wounds may\r\nthen be sponged twice a day with a lotion made with 1 dram sulphate of\r\nzinc, 1 dram carbolic acid, and 1 quart water.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETAINED AFTERBIRTH.\r\n\r\nThe cow, of all our domestic animals, is especially subject to this\r\naccident. This may be partly accounted for by the firm connections\r\nestablished through the fifty to one hundred cotyledons (Pl. XIII, fig. 2)\r\nin which the fetal membranes dovetail with the follicles of the womb. It is\r\nalso most liable to occur after abortion, in which preparation has not been\r\nmade by fatty degeneration for the severance of these close connections. In\r\nthe occurrence of inflammation, causing the formation of new tissue between\r\nthe membranes and the womb, we find the occasion of unnaturally firm\r\nadhesions which prevent the spontaneous detachment of the membranes. Again,\r\nin low conditions of health and an imperfect power of contraction we find a\r\npotent cause of retention, the general debility showing particularly in the\r\nindisposition of the womb to contract, after calving, with sufficient\r\nenergy to expel the afterbirth. Hence we find the condition common with\r\ninsufficient or innutritious feed, and in years or localities in which the\r\nfodder has suffered from weather. Ergoted, smutty, or musty fodder (Pl. V),\r\nby causing abortion, is a frequent cause of retention. Old cows are more\r\nsubject than young ones, probably because of diminishing vigor. A temporary\r\nretention is sometimes owing to a too rapid closure of the neck of the womb\r\nafter calving, causing strangulation and imprisonment of the membranes.\r\nConditions favoring this are the drinking of cold (iced) water, the eating\r\nof cold feed (frosted roots), and (through sympathy between udder and womb)\r\na too prompt sucking by the calf or milking by the attendant.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of retention of the afterbirth are usually only\r\ntoo evident, as the membranes hang from the vulva and rot away gradually,\r\ncausing the most offensive odor throughout the building. When retained\r\nwithin the womb by closure of its mouth and similarly in cases in which the\r\nprotruded part has rotted off, the decomposition continues and the fetid\r\nproducts escaping by the vulva appear in offensively smelling pools on the\r\nfloor and mat together the hairs near the root of the tail. The septic\r\nmaterials retained in the womb cause inflammation of its lining membrane,\r\nand this, together with the absorption into the blood of the products of\r\nputrefaction, leads to ill health, emaciation, and drying up of the milk.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment varies according to the conditions. When the cow is\r\nin low condition, or when retention is connected with drinking iced water\r\nor eating frozen feed, hot drinks and hot mashes of wheat bran or other\r\naliment may be sufficient. If along with the above conditions, the bowels\r\nare somewhat confined, an ounce of ground ginger, or half an ounce of black\r\npepper, given with a quart of sweet oil, or 1-1/2 pounds of Glauber's salt\r\nin at least 4 quarts of warm water, will often prove effectual. A bottle or\r\ntwo of flaxseed tea, made by prolonged boiling, should also be given at\r\nfrequent intervals. Other stimulants, like rue, savin, laurel, and\r\ncarminatives like anise, cumin, and coriander, are preferred by some, but\r\nwith very questionable reason, the more so that the first three are not\r\nwithout danger. Ergot of rye, 1 ounce, or its extract, 1 dram, may be\r\nresorted to to induce contraction of the womb. The mechanical extraction of\r\nthe membranes is, however, often called for; of this there are several\r\nmethods. The simplest is to hang a weight of 1 or 2 pounds to the hanging\r\nportion, and allow this, by its constant dragging and by its jerking effect\r\nwhen the cow moves, to pull the membranes from their attachments and to\r\nstimulate the womb to expulsive contractions. It frequently happens that\r\nthe afterbirth is only loosely adherent to the womb and its removal is\r\neffected if but a slight amount of traction on it is exerted. This can be\r\ndetermined by seizing the dependent part of the afterbirth between two\r\nsticks and rolling it up on them until they lie against the vulva; then, by\r\ncareful traction, accompanied with slight jerking movements from side to\r\nside, the womb is stimulated to expulsive contractions and the afterbirth\r\nis wound up more and more on the sticks until finally its last connections\r\nwith the womb are severed and the remainder is expelled suddenly en masse.\r\nIt is quite evident that neglected cases with putrid membranes are poor\r\nsubjects for this method, as the afterbirth is liable to tear across,\r\nleaving a mass in the womb. During the progress of the work any indication\r\nof tearing is the signal to stop and proceed with greater caution or\r\naltogether abandon the attempt in this way.\r\n\r\nThe following method (that with the skilled hand) is the most promptly and\r\ncertainly successful. For this the operator had better dress as for a\r\nparturition case. Again, the operation should be undertaken within\r\ntwenty-four hours after calving, since later the mouth of the womb may be\r\nso closed that it becomes difficult to introduce the hand. The operator\r\nshould smear his arms with carbolized lard or vaseline to protect them\r\nagainst infection, and particularly in delayed cases with putrid membranes.\r\nAn assistant holds the tail to one side, the operator seizes the hanging\r\nafterbirth with the left hand, while he introduces the other along the\r\nright side of the vagina and womb, letting the membranes slide through his\r\npalm until he reaches the first cotyledon to which they remain adherent. In\r\ncase no such connection is within reach, with the left hand gentle traction\r\nis made on the membranes until the deeper parts of the womb are brought\r\nwithin reach and the attachments to the cotyledons can be reached. Then the\r\nsoft projection of the membrane, which is attached to the firm\r\nfungus-shaped cotyledon on the inner surface of the womb, is seized by the\r\nlittle finger, and the other fingers and thumb are closed on it so as to\r\ntear it out from its connections. To explain this, it is necessary only to\r\nsay that the projection from the membrane is covered by soft, conical\r\nprocesses, which are received into cavities of a corresponding size on the\r\nsummit of the firm, mushroom-shaped cotyledon growing from the inner\r\nsurface of the womb. To draw upon the former, therefore, is to extract\r\nits soft, villous processes from within the follicles or cavities of the\r\nother. (Pl. XIII, fig. 2.) If at times it is difficult to start this\r\nextraction it may be necessary to get the finger nail inserted between the\r\ntwo, and once started the finger may be pushed on, lifting all the villi,\r\nin turn, out of their cavities. This process of separating the cotyledons\r\nmust be carefully conducted, one after another, until the last has been\r\ndetached and the afterbirth comes freely out of the passages. I have never\r\nfound any evil result from the removal of the whole mass at one operation,\r\nbut Shaack mentions the eversion of the womb as the possible result of the\r\nnecessary traction, and in cases in which those in the most distant part of\r\nthe horn of the womb can not be easily reached, he advises to attach a cord\r\nto the membranes inside the vulva, letting it hang out behind, and to cut\r\noff the membranes below the cord. Then, after two or three days' delay, he\r\nextracts the remainder, now softened and easily detached. If carefully\r\nconducted, so as not to tear the cotyledons of the womb, the operation is\r\neminently successful; the cow suffers little, and the straining roused by\r\nthe manipulations soon subsides. Keeping in a quiet, dark place, or driving\r\na short distance at a walking pace, will serve to quiet these. When the\r\nmembranes have been withdrawn, the hand, half closed, may be used to draw\r\nout of the womb the offensive liquid that has collected. If the case is a\r\nneglected one, and the discharge is very offensive, the womb must be\r\ninjected as for leucorrhea.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE VAGINA (VAGINITIS).\r\n\r\nThis may occur independently of inflammation of the womb, and usually as\r\nthe result of bruises, lacerations, or other injuries sustained during\r\ncalving. It will be shown by swelling of the lips of the vulva, which,\r\ntogether with their lining membrane, become of a dark-red or leaden hue,\r\nand the mucous discharge increases and becomes whitish or purulent, and it\r\nmay be fetid. Slight cases recover spontaneously, or under warm\r\nfomentations or mild astringent injections (a teaspoonful of carbolic acid\r\nin a quart of water), but severe cases may go on to the formation of large\r\nsores (ulcers), or considerable portions of the mucous membrane may die and\r\nslough off. Baumeister records two cases of diphtheritic vaginitis, the\r\nsecond case in a cow four weeks calved, contracted from the first in a\r\nnewly calved cow. Both proved fatal, with formation of false membranes as\r\nfar as the interior of the womb. In all severe cases the antiseptic\r\ninjections must be applied most assiduously. The carbolic acid may be\r\nincreased to one-half ounce to a quart, or chlorin water, or peroxid of\r\nhydrogen solution may be injected at least three times a day. Hyposulphite\r\nof soda, 1 ounce to a quart of water, is an excellent application, and the\r\nsame amount may be given by the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEUCORRHEA (MUCOPURULENT DISCHARGE FROM THE PASSAGES).\r\n\r\nThis is from a continued or chronic inflammation of the womb, or the\r\nvagina, or both. It usually results from injuries sustained in calving or\r\nfrom irritation by putrid matters in connection with retained afterbirth,\r\nor from the use of some object in the vagina (pessary) to prevent eversion\r\nof the womb. Exposure to cold or other cause of disturbance of the health\r\nmay affect an organ so susceptible as this at the time of parturition so as\r\nto cause inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The main symptom is the glairy, white discharge flowing\r\nconstantly or intermittently (when the cow lies down), soiling the tail and\r\nmatting its hairs and those of the vulva. When the lips of the vulva are\r\ndrawn apart the mucous membrane is seen to be red, with minute elevations,\r\nor pale and smooth. The health may not suffer at first, but if the\r\ndischarge continues and is putrid the health fails, the milk shrinks, and\r\nflesh is lost. If the womb is involved the hand introduced into the vagina\r\nmay detect the mouth of the womb slightly open and the liquid collected\r\nwithin its cavity. Examination with the oiled hand in the rectum may detect\r\nthe outline of the womb beneath, somewhat enlarged, and fluctuating under\r\nthe touch from contained fluid. In some cases heat is more frequent or\r\nintense than natural, but the animal rarely conceives when served, and, if\r\nshe does, is liable to abort.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment with the injections advised for vaginitis is\r\nsuccessful in mild or recent cases. In obstinate ones stronger solutions\r\nmay be used after the womb has been washed out by a stream of tepid water\r\nuntil it comes clear. A rubber tube is inserted into the womb, a funnel\r\nplaced in its raised end, and the water, and afterwards the solution,\r\npoured slowly through it. If the neck of the womb is so close that the\r\nliquid can not escape, a second tube may be inserted to drain it off. As\r\ninjections may be used chlorid of zinc, one-half dram to the quart of\r\nwater, or sulphate of iron, 1 dram to the quart. Three drams of sulphate of\r\niron and one-half ounce ground ginger may also be given in the feed daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE WOMB (METRITIS, INFLAMMATION OF WOMB AND ABDOMEN, OR\r\nMETROPERITONITIS).\r\n\r\nInflammation of the womb may be slight or violent, simple or associated\r\nwith putrefaction of its liquid contents and general poisoning, or it may\r\nextend so that the inflammation affects the lining membrane of the whole\r\nabdominal cavity. In the last two cases the malady is a very grave one.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The causes are largely the same as those causing inflammation of\r\nthe vagina. Greater importance must, however, be attached to exposure to\r\ncold and wet and to septic infection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms appear two or three days after calving, when the\r\ncow may be seen to shiver, or the hair stands erect, especially along the\r\nspine, and the horns, ears, and limbs are cold. The temperature in the\r\nrectum is elevated by one or two degrees, the pulse is small, hard, and\r\nrapid (70 to 100), appetite is lost, rumination ceases, and the milk\r\nshrinks in quantity or is entirely arrested, and the breathing is hurried.\r\nThe hind limbs may shift uneasily, the tail be twisted, the head and eyes\r\nturn to the right flank, and the teeth are ground. With the flush of heat\r\nto the horns and other extremities, there is redness of the eyes, nose, and\r\nmouth, and usually a dark redness about the vulva. Pressure on the right\r\nflank gives manifest pain, causing moaning or grunting, and the hind limbs\r\nare moved stiffly, extremely so if the general lining of the abdomen is\r\ninvolved. In severe cases the cow lies down and can not be made to rise.\r\nThere is usually marked thirst, the bowels are costive, and dung is passed\r\nwith pain and effort. The hand inserted into the vagina perceives the\r\nincreased heat, and when the neck of the womb is touched the cow winces.\r\nExamination through the rectum detects enlargement and tenderness of the\r\nwomb. The discharge from the vulva is at first watery, but becomes thick,\r\nyellow, and finally red or brown, with a heavy or fetid odor. Some cases\r\nrecover speedily and may be almost well in two days; a large proportion\r\nperish within two days of the attack, and some merge into the chronic form,\r\nterminating in leucorrhea. In the worst cases there is local septic\r\ninfection and ulceration, or even gangrene of the parts, or there is\r\ngeneral septicemia, or the inflammation involving the veins of the womb\r\ncauses coagulation of the blood contained in them, and the washing out of\r\nthe clots to the right heart and lung leads to the blocking of the vessels\r\nin the latter and complicating pneumonia. Inflammation of the womb and\r\npassages after calving are always liable to these complications, and\r\nconsequently to a fatal issue. Franck records three instances of rapidly\r\nfatal metritis in cows, all of which had been poisoned from an adjacent cow\r\nwith retained and putrid afterbirth. Others have had similar cases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment in the slight cases of simple inflammation does not\r\ndiffer much from that adopted for vaginitis, only care must be taken that\r\nthe astringent and antiseptic injections are made to penetrate into the\r\nwomb. After having washed out the womb a solution of chlorid of lime or\r\npermanganate of potassium (one-half ounce to 1 quart of water), with an\r\nounce each of glycerin and laudanum to render it more soothing, will often\r\nanswer every purpose. It is usually desirable to open the bowels with 1-1/2\r\npounds of Glauber's salt and 1 ounce of ginger in 4 quarts of warm water,\r\nand to apply fomentation of warm water or even mustard poultices or\r\nturpentine to the right flank.\r\n\r\nIn the violent attacks with high temperature and much prostration, besides\r\nthe salts agents must be given to lower the temperature and counteract\r\nseptic poisoning. Salicylate of soda one-half ounce, or quinia 2 drams\r\nevery four hours will help in both ways, or ounce doses of hyposulphite of\r\nsoda or dram doses of carbolic acid may be given as often until six doses\r\nhave been taken. Tincture of aconite has often been used in 20-drop doses\r\nevery six hours. If the temperature rises to 106∞ or 107∞ F., it must be\r\nmet by the direct application of cold or iced water to the surface. The\r\nanimal may be covered with wet sheets and cold water poured on them\r\nfrequently until the temperature in the rectum is lowered to 102∞ F. In\r\nsummer the cow may be allowed to dry spontaneously, while in winter it\r\nshould be rubbed dry and blanketed. Even in the absence of high temperature\r\nmuch good may be obtained from the soothing influence of a wet sheet\r\ncovering the loins and flanks and well covered at all points by a dry one.\r\nThis may be followed next day by a free application of mustard and oil of\r\nturpentine. When the animal shows extreme prostration, carbonate of ammonia\r\n(1 ounce) may be given to tide over the danger, but such cases usually\r\nperish.\r\n\r\nIn this disease, even more than in difficult and protracted parturition or\r\nretained placenta, the attendants must carefully guard against the\r\ninfection of their hands and arms from the diseased parts. The hand and arm\r\nbefore entering the passages should always be well smeared with lard\r\nimpregnated with carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nMILK FEVER (PARTURITION FEVER, PARTURIENT APOPLEXY, OR PARTURIENT\r\nCOLLAPSE).\r\n\r\nThis disease is not only peculiar to the cow, but it may be said to be\r\nvirtually confined to the improved and plethoric cow. It further occurs\r\nonly at or near the time of calving. Indeed, these two factors, calving and\r\nplethora, may be set apart as preeminently the causes of this disease. It\r\nis the disease of cows that have been improved in the direction of early\r\nmaturity, power of rapid fattening, or a heavy yield of milk, and hence it\r\nis characteristic of those having great appetites and extraordinary power\r\nof digestion. The heavy milking breeds are especially its victims, as in\r\nthem the demand for the daily yield of 50 to 100 pounds of milk means even\r\nmore than a daily increase of 2 to 3 pounds of body weight, mainly fat. The\r\nvictims are not always fat when attacked, but they are cows having enormous\r\npowers of digestion, and which have been fed heavily at the time. Hence the\r\nstall-fed, city-dairy cow, and the farm cow on a rich clover pasture in\r\nJune or July are especially subject. The condition of the blood globules in\r\nthe suffering cow attests the extreme richness and density of the blood,\r\nyet this peculiarity appears to have entirely escaped the notice of\r\nveterinary writers. I have never examined the blood of a victim of this\r\ndisease without finding the red-blood globules reduced to little more than\r\none-half their usual size. Now, these globules expand or contract according\r\nto the density of the liquid in which they float. If we dilute the blood\r\nwith water they will expand until they burst, whereas if solids, such as\r\nsalt or albumin, are added they shrink to a large extent. Their small size,\r\ntherefore, in parturition fever indicates the extreme richness of the\r\nblood, or, in other words, plethora.\r\n\r\nConfinement in the stall is an accessory cause, partly because stabled\r\ncattle are highly fed, partly because the air is hotter and fouler, and\r\npartly because there is no expenditure by exercise of the rich products of\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nHigh temperature is conducive to the malady, though the extreme colds of\r\nwinter are no protection against it. Heat, however, conduces to fever, and\r\nfever means lessened secretion, which means a plethoric state of the\r\ncirculation. The heats of summer are, however, often only a coincidence of\r\nthe real cause, the mature rich pastures, and especially the clover ones,\r\nbeing the greater.\r\n\r\nElectrical disturbances have an influence of a similar kind, disturbing the\r\nfunctions of the body and favoring sudden variations in the circulation. A\r\nsuccession of cases of the malady often accompany or precede a change of\r\nweather from dry to wet, from a low to a high barometric pressure.\r\n\r\nCostiveness, which is the usual concomitant of fever, may in a case of this\r\nkind become an accessory cause, the retention in the blood of what should\r\nhave passed off by the bowels tending to increase the fullness of the blood\r\nvessels and the density of the blood.\r\n\r\nMature age is a very strong accessory cause. The disease never occurs with\r\nthe first parturition, and rarely with the second. It appears with the\r\nthird, fourth, fifth, or sixth--after the growth of the cow has ceased and\r\nwhen all her powers are devoted to the production of milk.\r\n\r\nCalving is an essential condition, as the disturbance of the circulation\r\nconsequent on the contraction of the womb and the expulsion into the\r\ngeneral circulation of the enormous mass of blood hitherto circulating in\r\nthe walls of the womb fills to repletion the vessels of the rest of the\r\nbody and very greatly intensifies the already existing plethora. If this is\r\nnot speedily counterbalanced by a free secretion from the udder, kidneys,\r\nbowels, and other excretory organs, the most dire results may ensue.\r\nCalving may thus be held to be an exciting cause, and yet the labor and\r\nfatigue of the act are not active factors. It is after the easy calving,\r\nwhen there has been little expenditure of muscular or nervous energy and no\r\nloss of blood, that the malady is seen. Difficult parturitions may be\r\nfollowed by metritis, but they are rarely connected with parturition fever.\r\n\r\nAll these factors coincide in intensifying the one condition of plethora\r\nand point to that as a most essential cause of the affection. It is\r\nneedless to enter here into the much-debated question as to the mode in\r\nwhich the plethora brings about the characteristic symptoms and results. As\r\nthe results show disorder or suspension of the nervous functions mainly, it\r\nmay suffice to say that this condition of the blood and blood vessels is\r\nincompatible with the normal functional activity of the nerve centers. How\r\nmuch is due to congestion of the brain and how much to bloodlessness may\r\nwell be debated, yet in a closed box like the cranium, in which the\r\nabsolute contents can not be appreciably increased or diminished, it is\r\nevident that, apart from dropsical effusion or inflammatory exudation,\r\nthere can be only a given amount of blood; therefore, if one portion of the\r\nbrain is congested, another must be proportionately bloodless; and as\r\ncongestion of the eyes and head generally and great heat of the head are\r\nmost prominent features of the disease, congestion of the brain must be\r\naccepted. This, of course, implies a lack of blood in certain other parts\r\nor blood vessels.\r\n\r\nThe latest developments of treatment indicate very clearly that the main\r\ncause is the production of poisonous, metabolic products (leucomains and\r\ntoxins) by secreting cells of the follicles of the udder, acting on the\r\nsusceptible nerve centers of the plethoric, calving cow. Less fatal\r\nexamples of udder poisons are found in the first milk (colostrum), which is\r\ndistinctly irritant and purgative, and in the toxic qualities of the first\r\nmilk drawn from an animal which has been subjected to violent overexertion\r\nor excitement. Still more conclusive as to the production of such poisons\r\nis the fact that the full distention of the milk ducts and follicles, and\r\nthe consequent driving of the blood out of the udder and arrest of the\r\nformation of depraved products, determines a speedy and complete recovery\r\nfrom the disease. This does not exclude the other causes above named, nor\r\nthe influence of a reflex nervous derangement proceeding from the udder to\r\nthe brain.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It may be said that there are two extreme types of this\r\ndisease, with intervening grades. In both forms there is the characteristic\r\nplethora and more or less sudden loss of voluntary movement and sensation,\r\nindicating a sudden collapse of nervous power; in one, however, there is\r\nsuch prominent evidence of congestion of head and brain that it may be\r\ncalled the congestive form par excellence, without thereby intimating that\r\nthe torpid form is independent of congestion.\r\n\r\nIn the congestive form there is sudden dullness, languor, hanging back in\r\nthe stall, or drooping the head, uneasy movements of the hind limbs or\r\ntail; if the cow is moved, she steps unsteadily, or even staggers; she no\r\nlonger notices her calf or her feed; the eyes appear red and their pupils\r\ndilated; the weakness increases and the cow lies down or falls and after\r\nthat is unable to rise. At this time the pulse is usually full, bounding,\r\nand the temperature raised, though not invariably so, the head, horns, and\r\nears being especially hot and the veins of the head full, while the visible\r\nmucous membranes of nose and eyes are deeply congested.\r\n\r\nThe cow may lie on her breastbone with her feet beneath the body and her\r\nhead turned sleepily round, with the nose resting on the right flank; or,\r\nif worse, she may be stretched full on her side, with even the head\r\nextended, though at times it is suddenly raised and again dashed back on\r\nthe ground. At such times the legs, fore and hind, struggle convulsively,\r\nevidently through unconscious nervous spasm. By this time the\r\nunconsciousness is usually complete; the eyes are glazed, their pupils\r\nwidely dilated, and their lids are not moved when the ball of the eye is\r\ntouched with the finger. Pricking the skin with a pin also fails to bring\r\nany wincing or other response. The pulse, at first from 50 to 70 a minute,\r\nbecomes weaker and more accelerated as the disease advances. The breathing\r\nis quickened, becoming more and more so with the violence of the symptoms,\r\nand at first associated with moaning (in exceptional cases, bellowing), it\r\nmay, before death, become slow, deep, sighing, or rattling (stertorous).\r\nThe temperature, at first usually raised, tends to become lower as stupor\r\nand utter insensibility and coma supervene. The bowels, which may have\r\nmoved at the onset of the attack, become torpid or completely paralyzed,\r\nand, unless in case of improvement, they are not likely to operate again.\r\nYet this is the result of paralysis and not of induration of the feces, as\r\noften shown by the semiliquid, pultaceous condition of the contents after\r\ndeath. The bladder, too, is paralyzed and fails to expel its contents. A\r\nfree action of either bladder or bowels, or of both, is always a favorable\r\nsymptom. The urine contains sugar, in quantity proportionate to the\r\nseverity of the attack.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all cases the torpor of the digestive organs results in gastric\r\ndisorder; the paunch becomes the seat of fermentation, producing gas, which\r\ncauses it to bloat like a drum. There are frequent eructations of gas and\r\nliquid and solid feed, which, reaching the paralyzed throat, pass in part\r\ninto the windpipe and cause inflammations of the air passages and lungs.\r\n\r\nIn the torpid form of the disease there is much less indication of fever or\r\nviolence. There may be no special heat about the horns, ears, or forehead,\r\nnor any marked redness or congestion of the eyes or nose, nor engorgement\r\nof the veins of the head. The attack comes on more slowly, with apparent\r\nweakness of the hind limbs, dullness, drowsiness, suspension of rumination\r\nand appetite, and a general indifference to surrounding objects. Soon the\r\ncow lies down, or falls and is unable to rise, but for one or two days she\r\nmay rest on the breastbone and hold the head in the flank without showing\r\nany disorderly movements. Meanwhile there is not only loss of muscular\r\npower and inability to stand, but also considerable dullness of sensation,\r\npricking the skin producing no quick response, and even touching the edge\r\nof the eyelids causing no very prompt winking. Unless she gets relief,\r\nhowever, the case develops all the advanced symptoms of the more violent\r\nform, and the animal perishes.\r\n\r\nIn advanced and fatal cases of either form the insensibility becomes\r\ncomplete; no irritation of skin or eye meets any response; the eye becomes\r\nmore dull and glassy; the head rests on the ground or other object; unless\r\nprevented the cow lies stretched fully on her side; the pulse is small,\r\nrapid, and finally imperceptible; the breathing is slow, deep, stertorous,\r\nand the expirations accompanied with puffing is slow, the cheeks, and death\r\ncomes quietly or with accompanying struggles.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--For such fatal disease prevention is of far more consequence\r\nthan treatment. Among the most efficient preventives may be named a spare\r\ndiet (amounting to actual starvation in very plethoric, heavy-milking cows)\r\nfor a week before calving and at least four days after. A free access to\r\nsalt and water is most important, as the salt favors drinking and the water\r\nserves to dilute the rich and dense blood. Iced water, however, is\r\nundesirable, as a chill may favor the onset of fever. A dose of Epsom salt\r\n(1 to 2 pounds) should be given 12 to 24 hours before calving is due, so\r\nthat it may operate at or just before that act. In case calving has\r\noccurred unexpectedly in the heavy milker, no time should be lost in giving\r\nthe purgative thereafter. A most important precaution in the fleshy,\r\nplethoric cow, or in one that has been attacked at a previous calving, is\r\nto avoid drawing any milk from the bag for 12 or 24 hours after calving.\r\nBreeders on the island of Jersey have found that this alone has almost\r\nabolished the mortality from milk fever. If Epsom salt is not at hand,\r\nsaltpeter (1 ounce) should be used for several days. Daily exercise is also\r\nof importance, and, excepting in midsummer, when the heat of the sun may be\r\ninjurious, the value of open air is unquestionable. Even in summer an open\r\nshed or shady grove is incomparably better than a close, stuffy stall. A\r\nrich pasture (clover especially), in May, June, or July, when at its best,\r\nis to be carefully avoided. It is better to keep the cow indoors on dry\r\nstraw with plenty of salt and water than to have access to such pastures.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment of milk fever has been completely revolutionized,\r\nwith the result that a former mortality of 50 to 70 per cent has been\r\npractically abolished. Formerly the most vigorous treatment was practiced\r\nby bleeding, purging, the increase of peristalsis by eserin or pilocarpin,\r\nenemas, cold in the head, counterirritants, aconite, tartar emetic,\r\nsponging, wet-sheet packing, etc. The gross mortality, however, was not\r\nmaterially reduced, and nearly all that were attacked within the first two\r\ndays after calving perished.\r\n\r\nThe first step in the modern treatment was made in 1897, when J. Schmidt\r\npublished his successful treatment by the injection of the teats and milk\r\nducts with a solution of iodid of potassium (1-1/2 drams to 1 quart of\r\nwater). This reduced the mortality to 17 per cent. Others followed this\r\nlead by the injection of other antiseptics (lysol, creolin, creosol,\r\nchinosol, common salt, etherized air, oxygen). These succeeded as well as\r\nthe iodid solution. With the injection of gases, however, a fuller\r\ndistention of the udder was usually secured, and virtually every case\r\nrecovered. This suggested the full distention of the udder with common\r\natmospheric air filtered and sterilized, and this with the most perfect\r\nsuccess. With sterile air Schmidt-Kolding claimed 96.7 per cent recoveries\r\nin 914 cases.\r\n\r\nIn America the full distention of the udder, whether with oxygen or\r\nfiltered air, has proved invariably successful in all kinds of cases,\r\nincluding the violent ones that set in within a few hours after calving. In\r\n1 or 2 hours after the injection the cow has got up, had free passages from\r\nthe bowels and bladder, bright expression of countenance, and some return\r\nof appetite. In my cases which had made no response for 8 hours to the\r\niodid injection, the injection of the udder to full repletion with the gas\r\n(oxygen or air) has had immediately beneficial results. A similar full\r\ndistention of the bag with a common-salt solution (0.5 to 100), or even\r\nwith well-boiled water, is equally effective, but in these cases the weight\r\nof the liquid causes dragging upon the udder and a measure of discomfort\r\nwhich is escaped under the treatment with gas.\r\n\r\nThe value of each method depends on the fullness of distention of the udder\r\nand the arrest in larger part of the circulation and chemical changes in\r\nits tissues. This distention acts like magic, and seems hardly to admit of\r\nfailure in securing a successful outcome.\r\n\r\nIt can not, however, be recommended as absolutely devoid of dangers and\r\nserious complications. To get the best results it should be applied only by\r\none who has been trained in the careful antiseptic methods of the\r\nbacteriological laboratory. Some readers will recall the case of the\r\ninjection of the udders of show cows at Toronto to impose upon the judges.\r\nThe cows treated in this way had the udders infected and ruined, and\r\nseveral lost their lives. There is no better culture medium for septic and\r\nother germs than the first milk (colostrum) charged with albumin and\r\nretained in the warm udder. Already in the hands of veterinarians even the\r\nSchmidt treatment has produced a small proportion of cases of infective\r\nmammitis. How many more such cases will develop if this treatment becomes a\r\npopular domestic resort, applied by the dairyman himself in all sorts of\r\nsurroundings and with little or no antiseptic precautions? Even then,\r\nhowever, the losses will by no means approach the past mortality of 50 to\r\n70 per cent, so that the economy will be immeasurable under even the worst\r\nconditions. A fair test and judgment of this treatment, however, can be\r\nobtained only when the administrator is trustworthy and painstaking, well\r\nacquainted with bacteriological antisepsis and with the general and special\r\npathology of the bovine animal.\r\n\r\nThe necessary precautions may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Provide an elastic rubber ball and tubes furnished with valves to\r\ndirect the current of air, as in a common Davidson syringe.\r\n\r\n(2) Fill the delivery tube for a short distance with cotton sterilized by\r\nprolonged heating in a water bath.\r\n\r\n(3) In the free end of the delivery tube fit a milking tube to be inserted\r\ninto the teat.\r\n\r\n(4) Sterilize the entire apparatus by boiling for 30 minutes, and, without\r\ntouching the milking tube, wrap it in a towel that has been sterilized in a\r\nwater bath or in live steam and dried.\r\n\r\n(5) Avoid drawing any milk from the teats; wash them and the udder\r\nthoroughly with warm soapsuds; rinse off with well-boiled and cooled water,\r\nand apply to the teats, and especially to their tips, a 5 per cent solution\r\nof carbolic acid or lysol, taking care that the teats are not allowed to\r\ntouch any other body from the time they are cleansed until the teat tube is\r\ninserted. It is well to rest the cleansed and disinfected udder on a\r\nsterilized pad of cotton or a boiled towel.\r\n\r\n(6) The injecting apparatus is unwrapped; the teat tube, seized by its\r\nattached end and kept from contact with any other body, is inserted into\r\nthe teat, while an assistant working the rubber pump fills the quarter as\r\nfull as it will hold. The tube is now withdrawn and a broad tape is tied\r\naround the free end of the teat to prevent escape of the air.\r\n\r\n(7) The teat tube, which has been carefully preserved from possible contact\r\nwith other bodies, is dipped in the carbolic acid solution and inserted in\r\na second teat, and the second quarter is inflated, and so with the third\r\nand fourth.\r\n\r\n(8) The recumbent cow is kept resting on her breastbone, with the head\r\nelevated, even if it should be necessary to pack around her with straw\r\nbundles or to suspend the head by a halter. When lying on her side she is\r\nliable to develop fatal bloating and to have belching of gas and liquids,\r\nwhich, passing down the windpipe, cause fatal broncho-pneumonia.\r\n\r\n(9) If in 2 hours the cow is not on her feet, if there is no brighter or\r\nmore intelligent expression, if she has passed no manure or urine, and if\r\nthe air has become absorbed, leaving the udder less tense, the injection of\r\nthe bag may be repeated, under the same scrupulous and rigid precautions as\r\nat first. In all cases, but especially in severe ones, it is well to keep\r\nwatch of the patient, and to repeat the distention on the first indication\r\nof relapse. Should there not be a free discharge of feces and urine after\r\nrising, indicating a natural resumption of the nervous functions, the case\r\nshould be all the more carefully watched, so that the treatment may be\r\nrepeated if necessary.\r\n\r\nAccessory treatment may still be used, but is rarely necessary. A dose of\r\npurgative medicine (1-1/2 pounds of Epsom salt) in warm water may be given\r\nin the early stages, while as yet there is no danger of its passing into\r\nthe lungs through paralysis of the throat. Eserin or pilocarpin (1-1/2\r\ngrains) may be given under the skin to stimulate the movements of the\r\nbowels. Sponging the skin, and especially the udder, with cool water, may\r\nbe resorted to in hot weather.\r\n\r\nBloating may demand puncture of the paunch, in the left flank, with a\r\ncannula and trocar, the evacuation of the gas, and the introduction through\r\nthe tube of a tablespoonful of strong liquid ammonia in a quart of cold\r\nwater or other antiferment.\r\n\r\nThe economic value of the new treatment of milk fever is enormous. The\r\nUnited States has more than 22,000,000 milk cows. If we could raise their\r\nquality by preserving and breeding from the largest producers of both milk\r\nand butterfat, in place of losing the best by milk fever, as in the past,\r\nand if we could thus obtain an average increase of 2 quarts a day, the\r\nproceeds at 3 cents a quart would amount to $130,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPALSY AFTER CALVING (DROPPING AFTER CALVING).\r\n\r\nThis consists in a more or less complete loss of control of the hind limbs\r\noccurring after calving, and caused by low condition, weakness, and\r\nexposure to cold or to injurious compression of the nerves of the hind\r\nlimbs by a large calf passing through the pelvis. Its symptoms do not\r\ndiffer from those of palsy of the hind limbs, occurring at other times, and\r\nit may be treated in the same way, except so far as bruises of the vagina\r\nmay demand special smoothing treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE UDDER (GARGET).\r\n\r\nIn heavy milkers, before and just after calving, it is the rule that the\r\nmammary gland is enlarged, hot, tense, and tender, and that a slight\r\nexudation or pasty swelling extends forward from the gland on the lower\r\nsurface of the abdomen. This physiological congestion is looked upon as a\r\nmatter of course, and disappears in two or three days when the secretion of\r\nmilk has been fully established. This breaking up of the bag may be greatly\r\nhastened by the sucking of a hungry calf and the kneading it gives the\r\nudder with its nose, by stripping the glands clean thrice daily, and by\r\nactive rubbing at each milking with the palm of the hand, with or without\r\nlard or, better, with camphorated ointment.\r\n\r\nThe congestion may be at times aggravated by standing in a draft of cold\r\nair or by neglect to milk for an entire day or more (overstocking, hefting)\r\nwith the view of making a great show of udder for purposes of sale. In such\r\ncases the surface of the bag pits on pressure, and the milk has a reddish\r\ntinge or even streaks of blood, or it is partially or fully clotted and is\r\ndrawn with difficulty, mixed, it may be, with a yellowish serum (whey)\r\nwhich has separated from the casein. This should be treated like the above,\r\nthough it may sometimes demand fomentations with warm water to ward off\r\ninflammation, and it may be a week before the natural condition of the\r\ngland is restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER (SIMPLE MAMMITIS).\r\n\r\nCongestion may merge into active inflammation, or it may arise direct, in\r\nconnection with exposure to cold or wet, with standing in a cold draft,\r\nwith blows on the udder with clubs, stones, horns, or feet, with injury\r\nfrom a sharp or cold stone, or the projecting edge of a board or end of a\r\nnail in the floor, with sudden and extreme changes of weather, with\r\noverfeeding on rich albuminous feed like cotton seed, beans, or peas, with\r\nindigestions, with sores on the teats, or with insufficient stripping of\r\nthe udder in milking. In the period of full milk the organ is so\r\nsusceptible that any serious disturbance of the general health is liable to\r\nfall upon the udder.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms and mode of onset vary in different cases. When\r\nfollowing exposure there is usually a violent shivering fit, with cold\r\nhorns, ears, tail, and limbs, and general erection of the hair. This is\r\nsucceeded by a flush of heat (reaction) in which the horns, ears, and limbs\r\nbecome unnaturally warm and the gland swells up and becomes firm and solid\r\nin one, two, three, or all four quarters. There is hot dry muzzle, elevated\r\ntemperature, full, accelerated pulse, and excited breathing, impaired or\r\nsuspended appetite and rumination, with more or less costiveness,\r\nsuppression of urine, and a lessened yield of milk, which may be entirely\r\nsuppressed in the affected quarter.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the shivering escapes notice, the general disorder of the\r\nsystem is little marked or comes on late, and the first observed sign of\r\nillness is the firm swelling, heat, and tenderness of the bag. As the\r\ninflammation increases and extends, the hot, tender udder causes the animal\r\nto straddle with its hind limbs, and, when walking, to halt on the limb on\r\nthat side. If the cow lies down it is on the unaffected side. With the\r\nincrease in intensity and the extension of the inflammation the general\r\nfever manifests itself more prominently. In some instances the connective\r\ntissue beneath the skin and between the lobules of the gland is affected,\r\nthen the swelling is uniformly rounded and of nearly the same consistency,\r\npitting everywhere on pressure. In other cases it primarily attacks the\r\nsecreting tissue of the gland, then the swelling is more localized and\r\nappears as hard, nodular masses in the interior of the gland. This last is\r\nthe usual form of inflammation occurring from infection entering by the\r\nteats.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, but especially in the last-named form, the milk is suppressed\r\nand replaced by a watery fluid colored with blood (sometimes deeply) and\r\nmingled with masses of clotted casein. Later it becomes white and purulent,\r\nand in many cases of an offensive odor.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is sometimes so rapid and at others so slow that\r\nno definite rule can be laid down. In two or three days, or from that to\r\nthe end of the week, the bag may soften, lose its heat and tenderness, and\r\nsubside into the healthy condition, even resuming the secretion of milk.\r\nThe longer the inflammatory hardness continues the greater the probability\r\nthat its complete restoration will not be effected. When a portion of the\r\ngland fails to be restored in this way, and has its secretion arrested, it\r\nusually shrinks to a smaller size. More commonly a greater quantity of the\r\ninflammatory product remains in the gland and develops into a solid,\r\nfibrous mass, causing permanent hardening (induration). In other cases, in\r\nplace of the product of inflammation developing into a fibrous mass, it\r\nsoftens and breaks down into white, creamy, liquid pus (abscess). This\r\nabscess may make its way to the surface and escape externally, or it may\r\nburst into a milk duct and discharge through the teat. It may break into\r\nboth and establish a channel for the escape of milk (fistula). In the worst\r\ntypes of the disease gangrene may ensue, a quarter or half or even the\r\nwhole udder, losing its vitality, and sloughing off if the cow can bear up\r\nagainst the depressing influence. These gangrenous cases are probably\r\nalways the result of infection and sometimes run a very rapidly fatal\r\ncourse. I remember one to which I was called as soon as the owner noticed\r\nit, yet I found one-quarter dark blue, cold, and showing a tendency to the\r\nformation of blebs containing a bloody secretion. The cow, which had waded\r\nthrough a depth of semiliquid manure to reach her stall, died within 24\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment varies with the type and the stage of the disease.\r\nIf the case is seen in the shivering fit, every effort should be made to\r\ncut it short, as the inflammation may be thereby greatly moderated, if not\r\nchecked. Copious drinks of warm water thrown in from horn or bottle;\r\nequally copious warm injections; the application of heat in some form to\r\nthe surface of the body (by a rug wrung out of hot water; by hanging over\r\nthe back and loins bags loosely filled with bran, sand, salt, chaff, or\r\nother agent previously heated in a stove; by the use of a flatiron or the\r\nwarming of the surface by a hot-air bath), or by active friction with straw\r\nwisps by two or more persons; the administration of 1 ounce of ground\r\nginger may serve to shorten the attack. After half an hour's sweat the\r\nanimal should be rubbed and covered with a dry blanket.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, there is little or no fever, and only a slight\r\ninflammation, rub well with camphorated ointment or a weak iodin ointment,\r\nand milk three, four, or six times a day, rubbing the bag thoroughly each\r\ntime. Milking must be done with great gentleness, squeezing the teat in\r\nplace of pulling and stripping it, and if this causes too much pain, the\r\nteat tube (Pl. XXIV, fig. 4) or the spring teat dilator (Pl. XXIV, fig. 3)\r\nmay be employed. Antiseptic injections of the teats and udder are often\r\nuseful, and iodoform in water has been especially recommended. It may be\r\nreplaced by one of the injections advised for parturition fever, used with\r\nthe same careful precautions.\r\n\r\nIn cases in which the fever has set in and the inflammation is more\r\nadvanced, a dose of laxative medicine is desirable (Epsom salt, 1 to 2\r\npounds; ginger, 1 ounce), which may be followed, after the purging has\r\nceased, by daily doses of saltpeter, 1 ounce. Many rely on cooling and\r\nastringent applications to the inflamed quarter (vinegar, sugar-of-lead\r\nlotion, cold water, ice, etc.), but a safer and better resort is continued\r\nfomentation with warm water. A bucket of warm water, replenished as it\r\ncools, may be set beneath the udder, and two persons can raise a rug cut of\r\nthis and hold it against the udder, dipping it anew whenever the\r\ntemperature is somewhat lowered. A sheet may be passed around the body,\r\nwith holes cut for the teats, soft rags packed between it and the udder,\r\nand kept warm by pouring water on every 10 or 15 minutes, as warm as the\r\nhand can bear. When this has been kept up for an hour or two, the bag may\r\nbe dried, well rubbed with soap, and left thus with a soapy coating. If the\r\npain is great, extract of belladonna may be applied along with the soap,\r\nand a dry suspensory bandage with holes for the teats may be applied.\r\nStrong, mercurial ointment is very useful in relieving pain and softening\r\nthe bag. This is especially valuable when the disease is protracted and\r\ninduration threatens. It may be mixed with an equal quantity of soap and\r\nhalf as much extract of belladonna. In cases of threatened induration\r\nexcellent results are sometimes obtained from a weak-induction current of\r\nelectricity sent through the gland daily for 10 minutes.\r\n\r\nIf _abscess_ threatens, it may be favored by fomentation and opened as soon\r\nas fluctuation from finger to finger shows the formation of matter at a\r\npoint formerly hard. The wound may bleed freely, and there is a risk of\r\nopening a milk duct, yet relief will be obtained; also a dressing twice\r\ndaily with a lotion of carbolic acid 1 part, water 20 parts, and glycerin 1\r\npart will suffice to keep the wound clean and healthy.\r\n\r\n_Gangrene_ of the affected part is often fatal. It demands antiseptics\r\n(chlorid of zinc, 1 dram to 1 quart water) applied frequently to the part,\r\nor, if the case can not be attended, smear the affected quarter with Venice\r\nturpentine, melted, or even wood tar. Antiseptic tonics (tincture of\r\nchlorid of iron, 4 drams) may also be given four times daily in a quart of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS MAMMITIS (CONTAGIOUS INFLAMMATION OF THE UDDER).\r\n\r\nAs stated in the last article, that form of inflammation of the udder which\r\nattacks the gland ducts and follicles, causing deep-seated, hard, nodular\r\nswellings, is often contagious. Franck has demonstrated this by injecting\r\ninto the milk ducts in different cows (milking and dry) the pus from the\r\nbags of cows affected with mammitis, or the liquids of putrid flesh, or\r\nputrid blood, and in every case he produced acute inflammation of the gland\r\ntissue within twenty-four hours. He thinks that in ordinary conditions the\r\nseptic germ gains access by propagating itself through the milk, filling\r\nthe milk canal and oozing from the external orifice. He points to this as a\r\nreason why dry cows escape the malady, though mingling freely with the\r\nsufferers, and why such dry cows do not suffer from inflammation of the\r\ngland tissue when attacked with foot-and-mouth disease. In this last case\r\nit is evident that it is not simply the inoculation with the milker's hand\r\nthat is lacking, for the skin of the bag is attacked, but not its\r\nsecreting, glandular parts. Now that in any case of abscess we look for the\r\ncause in the chain forms of globular bacteria (_Streptococcus pyogenes_),\r\nin the cluster form of white, globular bacteria (_Staphylococcus pyogenes\r\nalbus_), and in the golden and citron-yellow forms of clustered globular\r\nbacteria (_Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_ and _Staphylococcus pyogenes\r\ncitreus_), the formation of pus gives presumptive evidence of the action of\r\none or more of these germs. So in cases of mortification of the bag; in the\r\nvery occurrence there is fair circumstantial evidence of the presence of\r\nerysipelas micrococcus or other germ which kills the local tissues. Again,\r\nin tuberculosis affecting the bag (a not uncommon condition), the active\r\nlocal cause is without doubt the tubercle bacillus.\r\n\r\nIt has been found that false membranes have formed in certain cases of\r\nmammitis in the cow, and Klein, after inoculating the diphtheria of man on\r\nthe cow, found an ulcerous sore in the seat of inoculation and blisters on\r\nthe teats and udder, in which he found what he believed to be the bacillus\r\nof diphtheria. The results are doubtful, even in the absence of false\r\nmembranes. Lˆffler, too, in the diphtheria of calves, found that the germ\r\nwas longer and more delicate than that of man, and that its pathogenesis\r\nfor rodents was less, guinea pigs having only a nonfatal abscess. The\r\npresence of false membranes in one form of mammitis in cows does not\r\nnecessarily imply its communicability to man.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted that scarlet fever has been transmitted from the cow\r\nto man, and it can not be denied that in many cases the infection has been\r\nspread by means of the milk. The facts, however, when brought out fully\r\nhave shown that in almost every case the milk had first come into contact\r\nwith a person suffering or recovering from scarlet fever, so that the milk\r\nwas infected after it left the cow. The alleged exceptional cases at Hendon\r\nand Dover, England, are not conclusive. In the Hendon outbreak inoculations\r\nwere made on calves from the slight eruption on the cow's teats, and they\r\nhad a slight eruption on the lips and a form of inflammation of the\r\nkidneys, which Dr. Klein thought resembled that of scarlatina. The cows\r\nthat had brought the disease to the Hendon dairies were traced back to\r\nWiltshire, where cows were found suffering from a similar malady, but no\r\nsign of scarlet fever resulted. In the Dover outbreak the dairyman first\r\ndenied any disease in his cows, and brought a certificate of a veterinarian\r\nto prove that they were sound at the time of the investigation; then later\r\nhe confessed that the cows had had foot-and-mouth disease some time\r\nbefore, and consequent eruption on the teats. So the question remains\r\nwhether the man who denied sickness in the cows to begin with, and adduced\r\nprofessional evidence of it, did not later acknowledge the foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease as a blind to hide the real source of the trouble in scarlatina in\r\nhis own family or in the family of an employee.\r\n\r\nIn America Dr. Stickler said that he had produced scarlatina in children by\r\ninoculation with imported virus of foot-and-mouth disease, but his\r\ncontention is negatived by the facts that with foot-and-mouth disease\r\nconstantly present in Europe scarlatina does not accompany it, and that in\r\nAmerica, with scarlatina constantly prevailing at some point,\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease is unknown locally except at long intervals and as\r\nthe result of the importation of infected animals or their products. Man is\r\nsusceptible to foot-and-mouth disease, but it never appears during the\r\nfrequent epidemics of scarlatina.\r\n\r\nAmong other contagious forms of mammitis I may name one which I have\r\nencountered in large dairies, starting as a sore and slight swelling at the\r\nopening of the teat and extending up along the milk duct to the gland\r\nstructure in the bag, all of which become indurated, nodular, and painful.\r\nThe milk is entirely suppressed in that quarter of the bag, and from that\r\nit may extend to the others as it does from cow to cow through the milker's\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nAnother form almost universally prevalent in this district of central New\r\nYork in 1889 broke out on the teats and udders as blisters strongly\r\nresembling cowpox, but which were not propagated when inoculated on calves.\r\nIt was only exceptionally that this extended through the teat to the gland\r\ntissue, yet in some instances the bag was lost from this cause. Scarlatina\r\nin man was very prevalent at the time (many schools were closed in\r\nconsequence), but no definite connection seemed to exist between this and\r\nthe cow disease, and on different dairy farms there were families of young\r\nchildren that had never had scarlet fever and who did not at that time\r\ncontract it.\r\n\r\nThe most common cause of contagious mammitis in cattle is a spherical\r\nbacterium in chain form (_Streptococcus_) (Moore, Ward). Yet it is clear\r\nthat contagious mammitis is not a single affection, but a group of diseases\r\nwhich have this in common, that they attack the udder.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Prevention is to be especially sought in all such cases. In\r\npurchasing new cows see that they come from a herd where the teats and\r\nudder are sound. If a new cow with unknown antecedents comes from a public\r\nmarket, let her be milked for a week by a person who does not milk any\r\nother cows. Keep her in a separate stall from others, so that there may be\r\nno infection from litter or flooring. Wash the udder with soap and water,\r\nand wet with a solution of two teaspoonfuls of carbolic acid in a pint of\r\nwater before letting the regular milker of the other cows take her. If any\r\ncow in the herd shows the indurated end of the teat or the inflammation and\r\nnodular tender character of the gland, sequestrate her at once and give her\r\na separate milker. If another cow is to be put into the stall she occupied,\r\nfirst clean and scrape it, and wet it with a strong solution of bluestone,\r\n5 ounces in a gallon of water. The milk may be drawn off with a teat tube,\r\nor spring teat dilator (Pl. XXIV, figs. 3 and 4), and the milk ducts\r\ninjected frequently with a solution of peroxid of hydrogen or iodoform. I\r\nhave had little success in checking the upward progress of the disease\r\nthrough the teat with carbolic acid or boric-acid solutions. Used on the\r\noutside of the other teats, however, they may serve to prevent them from\r\nbecoming infected. In the absence of peroxid of hydrogen the affected teat\r\nmay be injected with a solution of 1 grain corrosive sublimate in a pint of\r\nwater, and the same may be used on the other teats, provided it is washed\r\noff every time before milking.\r\n\r\nAs additional precautions, no cow with a retained afterbirth or unhealthy\r\ndischarge from the womb should be left with the other cows. Such cows\r\ndoubtless infect their own udders and those of the cows next them by\r\nlashing with the soiled tail. If milkers handle retained afterbirth or\r\nvaginal discharge, or unhealthy wounds, or assist in a difficult and\r\nprotracted parturition, they should wash the hands and arms thoroughly with\r\nsoap and warm water and then rub them with the corrosive-sublimate\r\nsolution, or if not, at least with one of carbolic acid. Clothes stained\r\nwith such offensive products should be thoroughly washed.\r\n\r\nThe general treatment of contagious mammitis does not differ from that of\r\nthe simple form, except that antiseptics should be given by the mouth as\r\nwell as applied locally (hyposulphite of soda, one-half ounce daily).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWPOX.\r\n\r\nThis is another form of contagious inflammation of the udder which does not\r\nspread readily from animal to animal except by the hands of the milker. It\r\nis held to occur spontaneously in the cow, but this is altogether\r\nimprobable, and so-called spontaneous cases are rather to be looked on as\r\ninstances in which the germs have been preserved dry in the buildings or\r\nintroduced in some unknown manner. It is not uncommon in the horse,\r\nattacking the heels, the lips, or some other inoculated part of the body,\r\nand is then easily transferred to the cow, if the same man grooms and\r\ndresses the horse and milks the cow. It may also appear in the cow by\r\ninfection, more or less direct, from a person who has been successfully\r\nvaccinated. Many believe that it is only a form of the smallpox of man\r\nmodified by passing through the system of cow or horse. It is, however,\r\nunreasonable to suppose that this alleged modified smallpox could have been\r\ntransmitted from child to child (the most susceptible of the human race)\r\nfor 90 years, under all possible conditions, without once reverting to its\r\noriginal type of smallpox. Chauveau's experiments on both cattle and horses\r\nwith the virus of smallpox and its inoculation back on the human subject go\r\nfar to show that in the climate of western Europe, at least, no such\r\ntransformation takes place. Smallpox remains smallpox and cowpox, cowpox.\r\nAgain, smallpox is communicable to a person who visits the patient in his\r\nroom but avoids touching him, while cowpox is never thus transferred\r\nthrough the air unless deliberately diffused in the form of spray.\r\n\r\nThe disease in the cow is ushered in by a slight fever, which, however, is\r\nusually overlooked, and the first sign is tenderness of the teats.\r\nExamined, these may be redder and hotter than normal, and at the end of two\r\ndays there appear little nodules, like small peas, of a pale-red color, and\r\nincreasing so that by the seventh day they may measure three-fourths of an\r\ninch to 1 inch in diameter. The yield of milk diminishes, and when heated\r\nit coagulates slightly. From the seventh to the tenth day the eruption\r\nforms into a blister, with raised margins and a depression in the center,\r\nand from which the whole of the liquid can not be drawn by a single\r\npuncture. The blister, in other words, is chambered, and each chamber must\r\nbe opened to evacuate the whole of the contents. If the pock forms on a\r\nsurface where there is thick hair it does not rise as a blister, but oozes\r\nout a straw-colored fluid which concretes on the hairs in an amber-colored\r\nmass. In one or two days after the pock is full it becomes yellow from\r\ncontained pus and then dries into a brownish-yellow scab, which finally\r\nfalls, leaving one or more distinct pits in the skin. Upon the teats,\r\nhowever, this regular course is rarely seen; the vesicles are burst by the\r\nhands of the milker as soon as liquid is formed, and as they continue to\r\nsuffer at each milking they form raw, angry sores, scabbing more or less at\r\nintervals, but are slow to undergo healing.\r\n\r\nThe only treatment required is to heal the sores. As milking is the main\r\ncause of their persistence, that must be done as gently as possible, or\r\neven with the teat tube or dilator. (Pl. XXIV, figs. 3 and 4.) It is\r\nessential to check the propagation of the germ, and for this purpose the\r\nsore teats may be washed frequently with a solution of half an ounce\r\nhyposulphite of soda in a pint of water. This will usually check the\r\ninflammation and cut short the malady.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPRESSION OF MILK.\r\n\r\nThe absence of milk in the udder may result from ill health, debility,\r\nemaciation, chronic disease of the bag, wasting of the gland from previous\r\ndisease, or insufficient feed, but sometimes it will occur suddenly without\r\nany appreciable cause. The treatment consists in removing the cause of the\r\ndisease, giving rich albuminoid feed made into warm mashes, and\r\nadministering ounce doses of aromatic carminatives, like anise seed, fennel\r\nseed, etc. Rubbing and stripping the udder are useful; the application of\r\noil of lavender or of turpentine, or even a blister of Spanish flies, will\r\nsometimes succeed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOODY MILK.\r\n\r\nBlood may escape with the milk when the udder has been injured by blows;\r\nalso when it is congested or inflamed, when the circulation through it has\r\nbeen suddenly increased by richer and more abundant feed, or when the cow\r\nis under the excitement of heat. The milk frothing up and assuming a pink\r\ntinge is often the first sign of red water, and it may result from eating\r\nacrid or irritant plants, like the RanunculaceÊ, resinous plants, etc.\r\nDeposits of tubercle or tumors in the udder, or induration of the gland,\r\nmay be efficient causes, the irritation caused by milking contributing to\r\ndraw the blood. Finally, there may be a reddish tinge or sediment when\r\nmadder or logwood has been eaten.\r\n\r\nIn milk which becomes red after it is drawn it may be from the presence in\r\nit of the _Bacillus prodigiosus._ This also grows on bread, and is the\r\nexplanation of the supposed miracle of the \"bleeding host.\"\r\n\r\nThe treatment will vary with the cause. In congested glands give 1 pound of\r\nEpsom salt, and daily thereafter one-half ounce saltpeter, with a dram of\r\nchlorate of potassium; the bag should be bathed with hot or cold water, and\r\nrubbed with camphorated lard. If the feed is too rich or abundant it must\r\nbe reduced. If from acrid plants, they must be removed from pasture or\r\nfodder. Induration of the udder may be met by rubbing with a combination of\r\niodin ointment 1 part, soft soap 2 parts; mercurial ointment and soap also\r\nmay be used. Careful milking is imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE MILK.\r\n\r\nWatery milk is blue, but the presence of a germ (_Bacillus cyanogenes_)\r\ncauses a distinct blue shade even in rich milk and cream. It may reach the\r\nmilk after it has been drawn, or it may find its way into the opening of\r\nthe milk ducts and enter the milk as it is drawn. In the latter case\r\nfrequent milking and the injection of a solution of 2 drams of hyposulphite\r\nof soda in a pint of water into the teats will serve to destroy the germs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRINGY MILK.\r\n\r\nThis may be caused by fungi developing in the liquid, and that the spores\r\nare present in the system of the cow may be safely inferred from the fact\r\nthat in a large herd two or three cows only will yield such milk at a time,\r\nand that after a run of 10 days or a fortnight they will recover and others\r\nwill be attacked. I have found that such affected cows had the temperature\r\nraised one or two degrees above the others. Like most other fungi this does\r\nnot grow out into filaments within the body of the cow, but in five or six\r\nhours after milking the surface layers are found to be one dense network of\r\nfilaments. If a needle is dipped in this and lifted the liquid is drawn out\r\ninto a long thread. In one case which I investigated near Ithaca, N. Y.,\r\nthe contamination was manifestly from a spring which oozed out of a bank of\r\nblack-muck soil and stood in pools mixed with the dejections of the\r\nanimals. Inoculation of pure milk with the water as it flowed out of this\r\nbank developed in it the fungus and the stringy characters. By fencing the\r\nspring in and giving the affected cows each 2 drams bisulphite of soda\r\ndaily, the trouble was arrested promptly and permanently.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPPED TEATS.\r\n\r\nThese may be caused by anything which irritates them. The powerful sucking\r\nof the calf; the sudden chilling of the teat in winter after the calf has\r\njust let it go or after the completion of milking with a wet hand; contact\r\nwith cold water or stagnant, putrid water, or with filth or irritants when\r\nlying down; slight congestions of the skin in connection with overstocking;\r\nindeed, any source of local irritation may cause chapping. This may be\r\nslight or extend into great, gaping sores and induce retention of milk or\r\neven mammitis. Soothing applications of vaseline or a combination of equal\r\nparts of spermaceti and oil of sweet almonds may be applied. If healing is\r\ntardy, add 10 grains balsam of Peru to the ounce of ointment. If the\r\nirritation is very great, wash first with a solution of 1 dram sugar of\r\nlead in 1 pint of water and then apply benzoated zinc-oxid ointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nWARTS ON THE TEATS.\r\n\r\nThese are often very troublesome, yet they may be greatly benefited or\r\nentirely removed by smearing them thickly with pure olive oil after each\r\nmilking. If they persist they may be cut off with a pair of sharp scissors\r\nand the sore touched with a stick of lunar caustic. They may now be oiled\r\nand the caustic repeated as demanded to prevent their renewed growth.\r\n\r\n_Scabby teats_ may be smeared with vaseline containing carbolic acid enough\r\nto give it an odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAT BLOCKED BY CONCRETION OF CASEIN.\r\n\r\nUnder unhealthy conditions of the gland or milk ducts clots of casein form\r\nwhich, pressed clear of most of their liquid and rolled into rounded\r\nmasses, may block the passage. They can be moved up and down by\r\nmanipulation of the teat, and if they can not be pressed out they may be\r\nextracted by using the spring teat dilator (Pl. XXIV, fig. 3), being held\r\nsurrounded by its three limbs. Before extraction is attempted an ounce of\r\nalmond oil, boiled, should be injected into the teat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAT BLOCKED BY CALCULUS.\r\n\r\nWhen the calcareous matter of the milk has been precipitated in the form of\r\na smooth, rounded stone, a rough, conglomerated concretion, or a fine,\r\nsandlike dÈbris, it may cause obstruction and irritation. These bodies are\r\nfelt to be much harder than those formed by casein, and the milk usually\r\ncontains gritty particles. Extraction may be attempted, in the case of the\r\nfinely divided gritty matter, by simple milking or with the spring dilator\r\n(Pl. XXIV, fig. 3) in the case of the larger masses. Should this fail the\r\nteat may be laid open with the knife and sewed up again or closed with\r\ncollodion, but such an operation is best deferred until the cow is dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAT BLOCKED BY A WARTY OR OTHER GROWTH INSIDE.\r\n\r\nIn this case the obstruction may be near the orifice of the teat or farther\r\nup, and the solid mass is not movable up and down with the same freedom as\r\nare concretions and calculi. The movement is limited by the elasticity of\r\nthe inner membrane of the teat from which it grows, and is somewhat freer\r\nin certain cases because the growth has become loose and hangs by a narrow\r\nneck. In the case of the looser growths they may be snared by a fine,\r\nspring wire passed as a loop through a fine tube (like a teat tube open at\r\neach end) and introduced into the teat. When this can not be done, the only\r\nresort is to cut in and excise it while the cow is dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHICKENING OF THE MUCOUS MEMBRANE AND CLOSURE OF THE\r\nMILK DUCT.\r\n\r\nAs a result of inflammation extending from without inward, a gradual\r\nnarrowing of the milk duct may occur from thickening and narrowing of its\r\nlining membrane. This may be limited to a small area near the lower end, or\r\nit may extend through the whole length of the teat. The stream of milk\r\nbecomes finer and finer until it finally ceases altogether, and a firm cord\r\nis felt running through the teat. If the constriction is only at the\r\noutlet, the teat may be seized and distended by pressing the milk down into\r\nit from above, and an incision may be made with a sharp penknife in two\r\ndirections at right angles to each other and directly in the original\r\nopening. The knife should be first cleansed in boiling water. The opening\r\nmay be kept from closing by a dumb-bell shaped bougie of gutta-percha (Pl.\r\nXXIV, fig. 5) or by the spring dilator. If the obstruction is more extended\r\nit may be perforated by L¸thi's perforating sound. (Pl. XXIV, fig. 1A and\r\n1B.) This is a steel wire with a ring at one end, and at the other is\r\nscrewed on to the wire a conical cap with sharp cutting edges at the base,\r\nwhich scrapes away the thickened masses of cells as it is drawn back. This\r\nmay be passed again and again to enlarge the passages sufficiently, and\r\nthen the passage may be kept open by wearing a long, dumb-bell bougie, a\r\nthick piece of carbolized catgut, or a spring dilator. If the passage can\r\nnot be sufficiently opened with the sound it may be incised by the hidden\r\nbistoury. (Pl. XXIV, fig. 2.) This is a knife lying alongside a flattened\r\nprotector with smooth, rounded edges, but which can be projected to any\r\nrequired distance by a lever on the handle. The incisions are made in four\r\ndirections, as deep as may be necessary, and the walls then can be held\r\napart by the spring dilator until they heal. In case the constriction and\r\nthickening of the canal extend the whole length of the teat, it is\r\npractically beyond remedy, as the gland is usually involved so as to render\r\nit useless.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSURE OF THE MILK DUCT BY A MEMBRANE.\r\n\r\nIn this form the duct of the teat is closed by the constriction of its\r\nlining membrane at one point, usually without thickening. The closure\r\nusually takes place while the cow is dry; otherwise its progress is\r\ngradual, and for a time the milk may still be pressed through slowly. In\r\nsuch case, if left at rest, the lower part of the teat fills up and the\r\nmilk flows in a full stream at the first pressure, but after this it will\r\nnot fill up again without sufficient time for it to filter through. This is\r\nto be cut open by the hidden bistoury (Pl. XXIV, fig. 2), which may be\r\nfirst passed through the opening of the membrane, if such exists. If not it\r\nmay be bored through, or it may be pressed up against the membrane at one\r\nside of the teat and opened toward the center, so as to cut its way\r\nthrough. Incisions should be made in at least two opposite directions, and\r\nthe edges then may be held apart by wearing the spring dilator until\r\nhealing has been completed.\r\n\r\nIn all cases of operations on the teats the instruments must be thoroughly\r\ndisinfected with hot water, or by dipping in carbolic acid and then in\r\nwater that has been boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nOPENING IN THE SIDE OF THE TEAT (MILK FISTULA).\r\n\r\nThis may occur from wounds penetrating the milk duct and failing to close,\r\nor it may be congenital, and then very often it leads to a distinct milk\r\nduct and an independent portion of the gland. In the first form it is\r\nnecessary only to dissect away the skin leading into the opening for some\r\ndistance down, to close the orifice with stitches, and to cover the whole\r\nwith collodion. A teat tube or spring dilator may be worn to drain the milk\r\noff and prevent distention and reopening of the orifice. In case of an\r\nindependent milk duct and gland one of two courses may be selected--to open\r\nthe one duct into the other by incision and then close the offending\r\nopening, or to inject the superfluous gland through its duct with a caustic\r\nsolution, so as to destroy its secreting power. In both cases it is\r\ndesirable to wait until the cow goes dry.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDISEASES FOLLOWING PARTURITION.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATES XXII, XXIII.

R. C. V. S.,\r\n\r\n_Formerly Professor of Veterinary Science, etc., in Cornell University._\r\n\r\n\r\nSUSPENDED BREATHING.\r\n\r\nThe moment the circulation through the navel string is stopped the blood of\r\nthe calf begins to become overcharged with carbon dioxid (CO_{2}), and\r\nunless breathing is speedily established death promptly follows.\r\nFortunately the desire to breathe, roused by the circulation of the venous\r\nblood and the reflex action from the wet and chilling skin, usually starts\r\nthe contractions of the diaphragm at once and life is insured. Among the\r\nobstacles to breathing may be named suffocation before or during birth from\r\ncompression of the navel cord and the arrest of its circulation; the\r\ndetachment of the fetal membranes from the womb before the calf is born; a\r\ntoo free communication between the two auricles (foramen ovale) of the\r\nheart by which the nonaerated blood has mixed too abundantly with the\r\naerated and induced debility and profound weakness; a condition of ill\r\nhealth and debility of the calf as a result of semistarvation, overwork, or\r\ndisease of the cow; fainting in the debilitated calf when calving has been\r\ndifficult and prolonged; the birth of the calf with its head enveloped in\r\nthe fetal membranes, so that it has been unable to breathe, and the\r\npresence of tenacious phlegm in the mouth and nose, acting in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nBesides the importance of proper care and feeding of the cow as a\r\npreventive measure, attention should be given at once to relieve the\r\nnewborn calf of its investing membrane and of any mucus that has collected\r\nin mouth or nostrils. Wiping out the nose deeply with a finger or feather\r\nexcites to sneezing, hence to breathing. Blowing into the nose has a\r\nsimilar effect. Sucking the nostril through a tube applied to it is even\r\nmore effective. Slapping the chest with the palm of the hand or with a\r\ntowel dipped in cold water, compression and relaxation alternately of the\r\nwalls of the chest, may start the action, and ammonia or even tobacco smoke\r\nblown into the nose may suffice. Every second is precious, however, and if\r\npossible the lungs should be dilated by forcibly introducing air from a\r\nbellows or from the human lungs. As the air is blown in through bellows or\r\na tube the upper end of the windpipe must be pressed back against the\r\ngullet, as otherwise the air will go to the stomach. In a large dairy a\r\npiece of elastic tubing one-third of an inch in bore should be kept at hand\r\nfor sucking and blowing in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLEEDING FROM THE NAVEL.\r\n\r\nThis may occur in two conditions--when the cord is cut off too close to the\r\nnavel and left untied and when it tears off at the navel. (Pl. XIV.) It may\r\nalso bleed when torn across naturally, if it is sucked by the dam or\r\nanother calf. In an animal with little plasticity to its blood it will flow\r\nunder almost any circumstances. When any cord is left it is always safe to\r\ntie it, and it is only when it is swollen and may possibly contain a loop\r\nof the bowel that there is danger in doing so. By pressing upward any bulky\r\ncontents such danger is avoided. If torn or cut too close to be tied the\r\nbleeding may be checked by applying alum, copperas, or for a fraction of a\r\nsecond the end of an iron rod at a dull-red heat. If much blood has been\r\nlost it may be requisite to transfuse several ounces of blood or of a weak,\r\ncommon-salt solution into the open, umbilical vein.\r\n\r\n\r\nURINE DISCHARGED THROUGH THE NAVEL (PERSISTENT URACHUS).\r\n\r\nBefore birth the urine passes from the bladder by a special tube through\r\nthe navel and navel string into the outer water bag (allantois). (Pl. XII.)\r\nThis closes at birth, and the tube shrinks into a fine cord up to the\r\nbladder. It is only in the bull calf that it is liable to remain open,\r\ndoubtless because of the long, narrow channel through which the urine must\r\notherwise escape. The urethra, too, is sometimes abnormally narrow, or even\r\nclosed, in the male. If part of the cord remains, it should be tied and the\r\nwhole allowed to wither up naturally. If the cord has been removed and the\r\ntube (urachus) protrudes, discharging the urine, that alone must be tied.\r\nIf there is nothing pendent the urachus must be seized, covered by the\r\nskin, and a curved needle being passed through the skin and above the duct,\r\nit may be tied along with this skin. A blister of Spanish flies, causing\r\nswelling of the skin, will often close the orifice--so with the hot iron.\r\nIf the urethra of the male is impervious it can rarely be remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE URACHUS (NAVEL URINE DUCT).\r\n\r\nThis may originate in direct, mechanical injury to the navel in calving, or\r\nshortly after, with or without the lodgment of irritant or septic matter on\r\nits lacerated or cut end. The mere contact with healthy urine, hitherto\r\nharmless, can now be looked on as becoming suddenly irritating. The\r\naffection is usually marked by the presence of redness and swelling at the\r\nposterior part of the navel and the escape of urine and a few drops of\r\nwhitish, serous pus from the orifice of the urachus. In those cases in\r\nwhich urine is not discharged a tender swelling, like a thick cord\r\nextending upward and backward from the navel into the abdomen, may be\r\nidentified. The navel enlargement may be considerable, but it is solid,\r\ndoes not gurgle on handling, and can not be done away with by pressing it\r\nback into the abdomen, as in a case of hernia.\r\n\r\nIn cases at first closed the pus may burst out later, coming from the back\r\npart of the navel and the swelling extending backward. In other cases\r\nwhitish pus may pass with the urine by the ordinary channel, showing that\r\nit has opened back into the bladder. In other cases the umbilical veins\r\nbecome involved, in which case the swelling extends forward as well as\r\nbackward. Thus the disease may result in destructive disorders of the\r\nliver, lungs, and, above all, of the joints.\r\n\r\nThe disease may usually be warded off or rendered simple and comparatively\r\nharmless by applying antiseptics to the navel string at birth (carbolic\r\nacid 1 part, water and glycerin 5 parts each, or wood tar). Later,\r\nantiseptics may be freely used (hyposulphite of soda 4 drams, water 1\r\nquart) as an application to the surface and as an injection into the\r\nurachus, or even into the bladder if the two still communicate. If they no\r\nlonger communicate, a stronger injection may be used (tincture of chlorid\r\nof iron 60 drops, alcohol 1 ounce). Several weeks will be required for\r\ncomplete recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESS OF THE NAVEL.\r\n\r\nAs the result of irritation at calving or by the withered cord, or by\r\nlicking with the rough tongue of the cow, inflammation may attack the loose\r\nconnective tissue of the navel to the exclusion of the urachus and veins,\r\nand go on to the formation of matter. In this case a firm swelling appears\r\nas large as the fist, which softens in the center and may finally burst and\r\ndischarge. The opening, however, is usually small and may close\r\nprematurely, so that abscess after abscess is formed. It is distinguished\r\nfrom hernia by the fact that it can not be returned into the abdomen, and\r\nfrom inflammations of the veins and urachus by the absence of swellings\r\nforward and backward along the lines of these canals.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in an early opening of the abscess by a free incision\r\nand the injection twice a day of an astringent antiseptic (chlorid of zinc\r\none-half dram, water 1 pint).\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE NAVEL VEINS (UMBILICAL PHLEBITIS).\r\n\r\nIn this affection of the navel the inflammation may start directly from\r\nmechanical injury, as in either of the two forms just described, but on\r\nthis are inoculated infective microbes, derived from a retained and\r\nputrefying afterbirth, an abortion, a metritis, a fetid discharge from the\r\nwomb, an unhealthy open sore, a case of erysipelas, from overcrowding, from\r\nfilthy floor or bedding, or from an offensive accumulation of manure, solid\r\nor liquid. As the microbes vary in different cases, given outbreaks will\r\ndiffer materially in their nature. One is erysipelatoid; another purulent\r\ninfection with the tendency to secondary abscesses in the joints, liver,\r\nlungs, etc.; another is from a septic germ and is associated with fetid\r\ndischarge from the navel and general putrid blood poisoning. In estimating\r\nthe causes of the disease we must not omit debility of the calf when the\r\nmother has been underfed or badly housed or when either she or the fetus\r\nhas been diseased.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms vary. With the chain-form germs (streptococci)\r\nthe navel becomes intensely red, with a very firm, painful swelling, ending\r\nabruptly at the edges in sound skin and extending forward along the\r\numbilical veins. The secondary diseases are circumscribed, black\r\nengorgements (infarctions) or abscesses of the liver, lungs, kidneys,\r\nbowels, or other internal organs, and sometimes disease of the joints.\r\n\r\nWith the ordinary pus-producing germs (_Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_ and\r\n_Streptococcus pyogenes_) the local inflammation in the navel causes a hot,\r\npainful swelling, which rapidly advances to the formation of matter (pus),\r\nand the raw, exposed surface, at first bright red, becomes dark red or\r\nblack, soft, friable, and pultaceous. If the pus is white, creamy, and\r\ncomparatively inoffensive in odor, the secondary formations in internal\r\norgans and joints are mainly of the same purulent character (secondary\r\nabscesses).\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the discharge is very offensive and the pus more\r\nserous, watery, or bloody, there is reason to suspect the presence of some\r\nof the septic bacteria, and the results on the general system are a high\r\nfever and softening of the liver and spleen and no tendency to abscesses of\r\nthe internal organs. Diarrhea is a common symptom, and death ensues early,\r\nthe blood after death being found unclotted.\r\n\r\nComplicated cases are common, and in all alike the umbilical veins usually\r\nremain open and can be explored by a probe passed at first upward and then\r\nforward toward the liver.\r\n\r\nPrevention is sought by applying a lotion of carbolic acid or iodin\r\nsolution to the navel string at birth, or it may be smeared with common\r\nwood tar, which is at once antiseptic and a protective covering against\r\ngerms. In the absence of either a strong decoction of oak bark may be used.\r\n\r\n_Local treatment_ consists in the application of antiseptic to the surface\r\nand their injection into the vein. As a lotion carbolic acid, 1 ounce in a\r\nquart of strong decoction of oak bark, should be used, or salicylic acid or\r\nsalol may be sprinkled on the surface. The interior of the vein should be\r\nswabbed out with a probe wrapped around with cotton wool and dipped in\r\nboracic salicylic acid.\r\n\r\nIf complications have extended to the liver or other internal organs, or\r\nthe joints, other treatment will be demanded. In acute cases of general\r\ninfection an early fatal result is to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nPYEMIC AND SEPTICEMIC INFLAMMATION OF JOINTS IN CALVES\r\n(JOINT ILL).\r\n\r\nThis occurs in young calves within the first month after birth. It persists\r\nin the joints when once attacked, and is usually connected with disease of\r\nthe navel. Rheumatism, on the other hand, rarely occurs in a calf under a\r\nmonth old. It tends to shift from joint to joint, and is independent of any\r\nnavel disease. Again, it affects the fibrous structures of the joints, and\r\nrarely results in the formation of white matter, while the affection before\r\nnamed attacks the structures outside as well as inside the joints and,\r\nabove all, the ends of the bones, and tends to the destruction and\r\ncrumbling of their tissue, and even to the formation of open sores, through\r\nwhich the fragile bones are exposed. The microbes from the unhealthy and\r\ninfected wound in the navel pass into the system through the veins, or\r\nlymphatics, and form colonies and local inflammations and abscesses in and\r\naround the joints.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are the swelling of one or more joints, which are\r\nvery hot and tender. The calf is stiff and lame, lies down constantly, and\r\ndoes not care to suck. There is very high fever, accelerated breathing and\r\npulse, and there is swelling and purulent discharge (often fetid) from the\r\nnavel. There may be added symptoms of disease of the liver, lungs, heart,\r\nor bowels, on which we need not here delay. The important point is to\r\ndetermine the condition of the navel in all such cases of diseased and\r\nswollen joints beginning in the first month of life, and in all cases of\r\ngeneral stiffness, for besides the diseases of the internal organs there\r\nmay be abscesses formed among the muscles of the trunk, though the joints\r\nappear sound. Cases of this kind, if they do not speedily die, tend to\r\nbecome emaciated and perish later in a state of weakness and exhaustion.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Prevention must begin with the purity of the buildings and\r\nthe navel, as noted in the last article.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is in the main antiseptic. The slighter forms may\r\nbe painted daily with tincture of iodin, or an ointment of biniodid of\r\nmercury (1 dram) and lard (2 ounces) may be rubbed on the affected joints\r\ndaily until they are blistered. In case of swellings containing matter,\r\nthis may be drawn through the nozzle of a hypodermic syringe and the\r\nfollowing solution injected: Compound tincture of iodin, 1 dram; distilled\r\n(or boiled) water, 2 ounces. Internally the calf may take 5 grains quinin\r\ntwice daily and 15 grains hyposulphite of soda, or 20 grains salicylate of\r\nsoda three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nUMBILICAL HERNIA (BREACH AT THE NAVEL).\r\n\r\nThis may exist at birth from imperfect closure of the muscles around the\r\nopening; it may even extend backward for a distance, from the two sides\r\nfailing to come together. Apart from this, the trouble rarely appears after\r\nthe calf has been some time on solid feed, as the paunch then extends down\r\nto the right immediately over the navel, and thus forms an internal pad,\r\npreventing the protrusion of intestine.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of umbilical hernia are a soft swelling at the\r\nnavel, with contents that usually gurgle on handling, and can be entirely\r\nreturned into the abdomen by pressure. The diseases of the navel hitherto\r\nconsidered have no gurgling contents and can not be completely returned\r\ninto the abdomen. The only exception in the case of the hernia is when the\r\nwalls of the sac have become greatly thickened. These will, of course,\r\nremain as a swelling after the bowel has been returned; and when the\r\nprotruding bowel has contracted permanent adhesion to the sac, it is\r\nimpossible to return it fully without first severing that connection.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is not always necessary. A small hernia, like an\r\negg, in a new-born calf, usually recovers of itself as the animal changes\r\nits diet to solid feed and has the paunch fully developed as an internal\r\npad.\r\n\r\nIn other cases apply a leather pad 8 inches square attached around the body\r\nby two elastic bands connected with its four corners, and an elastic band\r\npassing from its front border to a collar encircling the neck, and two\r\nother elastic bands from the neck collar along the two sides of the body to\r\nthe two bands passing up over the back. (Pl. XXIV, fig. 6.)\r\n\r\nFor small hernias nitric acid may be used to destroy the skin and cause\r\nsuch swelling as to close the orifice before the skin is separated. For a\r\nmass like a large goose egg one-half ounce of the acid may be rubbed in for\r\nthree minutes. No more must be applied for 15 days. For large masses this\r\nis inapplicable, and with too much loss of skin the orifice may fail to\r\nclose and the bowels may escape.\r\n\r\nThe application of a clamp like those used in castration is a most\r\neffective method, but great care must be taken to see that all the contents\r\nof the sac are returned so that none may be inclosed in the clamp. (Pl.\r\nXXIV, fig. 7.)\r\n\r\nAnother most effective resort is to make a saturated solution of common\r\nsalt, filter and boil it, and when cool inject under the skin (not into the\r\nsac) on each side of the hernia a dram of the fluid. A bandage may then be\r\nput around the body. In 10 hours an enormous swelling will have taken\r\nplace, pressing back the bowel into the abdomen. When this subsides the\r\nwound will have closed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDROPSY OF THE NAVEL.\r\n\r\nA sac formed at the navel, by contained liquid accumulated by reason of\r\nsucking by other calves, is unsightly and sometimes injurious. After making\r\nsure that it is simply a dropsical collection it may be deeply punctured at\r\nvarious points with a large-sized lancet or knife, fomented with hot water,\r\nand then daily treated with a strong decoction of white-oak bark.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLUE DISEASE (CYANOSIS).\r\n\r\nThis appearing in the calf at birth is due to the orifice between the two\r\nauricles of the heart (foramen ovale) remaining too open, allowing the\r\nnonaerated (venous) blood to mix with the aerated (arterial) blood, and it\r\nis beyond the reach of treatment. It is recognized by the blueness of the\r\neyes, nose, mouth, and other mucous membranes, the coldness of the surface,\r\nand the extreme sensitiveness to cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\nAt birth the bowels of the calf contain the meconium, a tenacious, gluey,\r\nbrownish-yellow material largely derived from the liver, which must be\r\nexpelled before they can start their functions normally. The first milk of\r\nthe cow (colostrum, beestings), rich in albumin and salts, is nature's\r\nlaxative to expel this now offensive material and should never be withheld\r\nfrom the calf. If, for lack of this, from the dry feeding of the cow, or\r\nfrom any other cause, the calf is costive, straining violently without\r\npassage, lying down and rising as in colic, and failing in appetite, no\r\ntime should be lost in giving relief by an ounce dose of castor oil,\r\nassisting its action by injections of soapsuds or oil. Whatever meconium is\r\nwithin reach of the finger should be carefully removed. It is also\r\nimportant to give the cow a sloppy, laxative diet.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIGESTION.\r\n\r\nThis may occur from many different causes, as costiveness; a too liberal\r\nsupply of milk; milk too rich; the furnishing of the milk of a cow long\r\nafter calving to a very young calf; allowing a calf to suck the first milk\r\nof a cow that has been hunted, driven by road, shipped by rail, or\r\notherwise violently excited; allowing the calf too long time between meals,\r\nso that impelled by hunger it quickly overloads and clogs the stomach;\r\nfeeding from the pail milk that has been held over in unwashed (unscalded)\r\nbuckets, so that it is fermented and spoiled; feeding the milk of cows kept\r\non unwholesome feed; keeping the calves in cold, damp, dark, filthy, or\r\nbad-smelling pens; feeding the calves on artificial mixtures containing too\r\nmuch starchy matter; or overfeeding the calves on artificial feed that may\r\nbe appropriate enough in smaller quantity. The licking of hair from\r\nthemselves or others and its formation into balls in the stomach will cause\r\nobstinate indigestion in the calf.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are dullness, indisposition to move, uneasiness,\r\neructations of gas from the stomach, sour breath, entire loss of appetite,\r\nlying down and rising as if in pain, fullness of the abdomen, which gives\r\nout a drumlike sound when tapped with the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe costiveness may be marked at first, but soon it gives place to\r\ndiarrhea, by which the offensive matters may be carried off and health\r\nrestored. In other cases it becomes aggravated, merges into inflammation of\r\nthe bowels, fever sets in, and the calf gradually sinks.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Prevention consists in avoiding the causes enumerated above\r\nor any others that may be detected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in first clearing away the irritant\r\npresent in the bowels. For this purpose 1 or 2 ounces of castor oil with 20\r\ndrops of laudanum may be given, and if the sour eructations are marked a\r\ntablespoonful of limewater or one-fourth ounce calcined magnesia may be\r\ngiven and repeated two or three times a day. If the disorder continues\r\nafter the removal of the irritant, a large tablespoonful of rennet, or 30\r\ngrains of pepsin, may be given at each meal along with a teaspoonful of\r\ntincture of gentian. Any return of constipation must be treated by\r\ninjections of warm water and soap, while the persistence of diarrhea must\r\nbe met as advised under the discussion following this. In case of the\r\nformation of loose hair balls inclosing milk undergoing putrid\r\nfermentation, temporary benefit may be obtained by giving a tablespoonful\r\nof vegetable charcoal three or four times a day, but the only real remedy\r\nis to cut the paunch open and extract them. At this early age they may be\r\nfound in the third or even the fourth stomach; in the adult they are\r\nconfined to the first two and are comparatively harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIARRHEA (SCOURING) IN CALVES (SIMPLE AND CONTAGIOUS).\r\n\r\nAs stated in the last article, scouring is a common result of indigestion,\r\nand at first may be nothing more than an attempt of nature to relieve the\r\nstomach and bowels of offensive and irritating contents. As the indigestion\r\npersists, however, the fermentations going on in the undigested masses\r\nbecome steadily more complex and active, and what was at first the mere\r\nresult of irritation or suspended digestion comes to be a genuine\r\ncontagious disease, in which the organized ferments (bacteria) propagate\r\nthe affection from animal to animal and from herd to herd. More than once I\r\nhave seen such epizootic diarrhea start on the headwaters of a creek and,\r\ntraveling along that stream, follow the watershed and attack the herds\r\nsupplied with water from the contaminated channel. In the same way the\r\ndisease, once started in a cow stable, is liable to persist for years, or\r\nuntil the building has been thoroughly cleansed and disinfected. It may be\r\ncarried into a healthy stable by the introduction of a cow brought from an\r\ninfected stable when she is closely approaching calving. Another method of\r\nits introduction is by the purchase of a calf from a herd where the\r\ninfection exists.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the other causes of this disease we may refer to those noted\r\nabove as inducing indigestion. As a primary consideration any condition\r\nwhich lowers the vitality or vigor of the calf must be accorded a prominent\r\nplace among factors which, apart from contagion, contribute to start the\r\ndisease de novo. Other things being equal, the strong, vigorous races are\r\nthe least predisposed to the malady, and in this respect the compact form,\r\nthe healthy coat, the clear eye, and the bold, active carriage are\r\ndesirable. Even the color of the hair is not unimportant, as in the same\r\nherd I have found a far greater number of victims among the light colors\r\n(light yellow, light brown) than among those of a darker tint. This\r\nconstitutional predisposition to indigestion and diarrhea is sometimes\r\nfostered by too close breeding, without taking due account of the\r\nmaintenance of a robust constitution; hence animals that are very much\r\ninbred need to be especially observed and cared for unless their inherent\r\nvigor has been thoroughly attested.\r\n\r\nThe surroundings of the calf are powerful influences. Calves kept indoors\r\nsuffer to a greater extent than those running in the open air and having\r\nthe invigorating influences of sunshine, pure air, and exercise; close,\r\ncrowded, filthy, bad-smelling buildings are especially causative of the\r\ncomplaint. The presence in the air of carbon dioxid, the product of\r\nbreathing, and of the fetid, gaseous products of decomposing dung and urine\r\ndiminish by about one-fourth of their volume the life-giving oxygen and in\r\nthe same ratio hinder the aeration of the blood and the maintenance of\r\nvigorous health. Worse than this, such fetid gases are usually direct\r\npoisons to the animal breathing them; for example, sulphureted hydrogen\r\n(hydrogen sulphid 2 SH_{2}) and various alkaloids (ptomaines) and toxins\r\n(neutral poisonous principles) produced in the filth fermentations. These\r\nlower the general health and stamina, impair digestion, and by leading to\r\nthe accumulation in stomach and bowels of undigested materials they lay the\r\nfoundation for offensive fermentations within these organs and consequent\r\nirritation, poisoning, and diarrhea. They further weaken the system so that\r\nit can no longer resist and overcome the trouble.\r\n\r\nThe condition of the nursing cow and her milk is another potent cause of\r\ntrouble. The feed of the cow is important. The influence of this is shown\r\nin the following tables:\r\n\r\n  _Influence of feed on milk._ (_From Becquerel and Vernois._)\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------+--------+----------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                          |        |  Casein  |        |        |\r\n  |Character of feed.        | Water. |   and    |  Milk  |        |\r\n  |                          |        |extractive| sugar. | Butter.| Salts.\r\n  |                          |        |  matter. |        |        |\r\n  +--------------------------+--------+----------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n  |                          |_Parts  |_Parts    |_Parts  |_Parts  |_Parts\r\n  |                          |in 1,000_ in 1,000_|in 1,000_in 1,000_in 1,000_\r\n  |Cows on winter feed:      |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  Trefoil or lucern, 12-13|        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  pounds; oat straw, 9-10 |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  pounds; beets, 7 pounds;|        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  water, 2 buckets        | 871.26 |  47.81   | 33.47  |  42.07 |  5.34\r\n  |Cows on summer feed:      |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  Green trefoil, lucern,  |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  maize, barley, grass,   |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  2 buckets water         | 859.56 |  54.70   | 36.38  |  42.76 |  6.80\r\n  |Goat's milk on different  |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |  feed:                   |        |          |        |        |\r\n  |    On straw and trefoil  | 858.68 |  47.38   | 35.47  |  52.54 |  5.93\r\n  |    On beets              | 888.77 |  33.81   | 38.02  |  33.68 |  5.72\r\n  |Normal mean               | 844.90 |  35.14   | 36.90  |  56.87 |  6.18\r\n  |                          |        |          |        |        |\r\n  +--------------------------+--------+----------+--------+--------+--------+\r\n\r\nIn these examples the deterioration of the milk in casein on the less\r\nnutritious winter feeding is very marked, although the relative quantity of\r\nbutter remains almost unchanged. In the case of the goat the result is even\r\nmore striking, the beet diet giving a very large decrease of both casein\r\nand butter and an increase of milk sugar.\r\n\r\nThe second table following, condensed from the Iowa Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation Bulletin, gives the results in butter and total solids when the\r\nsame cows were fed on different rations in succession. Each cow was fed a\r\ndaily ration of 12 pounds corn fodder and 4 pounds clover hay, besides the\r\ntest diet of (1) 12-1/4 pounds corn-and-cob meal, and (2) 10 pounds sugar\r\nmeal--a product of the glucose manufacture. This special feed was given\r\nseven days before the commencement of each test period to obviate the\r\neffects of transition.

The opposite theory having been largely\r\ntaught, it becomes needful thus to sustain the old and well-founded belief\r\nof the dairymen.\r\n\r\nNot only does the richness of the milk vary with the nature of the food,\r\nbut it varies also according to the time of the day when it is drawn, the\r\nmorning milk giving 7-1/2 per cent of cream and the evening milk 9-1/2 per\r\ncent (Hassall). Boedecker found that the morning milk had 10 per cent of\r\nsolids, while the evening milk had 13 per cent. Again, the milk first drawn\r\nat any milking is always poorer than the last drawn. The first may have\r\nonly one-half, or in extreme cases one-fourth, the cream of the last. Once\r\nmore, when the cow is in heat the milk becomes richer in solids (casein and\r\nbutter), and contains granular and white blood cells like the colostrum,\r\nand often disagrees with the young animal living on it. Now, while these\r\nvarious modifications in the amount of solid matters may prove harmless to\r\na strong and vigorous calf, they can easily be the occasion of intestinal\r\ndisorder in a weaker one, or in one with health already somewhat impaired\r\nby sickness, exposure, or unwholesome buildings. The casein of the cow's\r\nmilk coagulates in one solid mass, and is much less easily penetrated by\r\nthe digesting fluids than the fine, flaky coagula of woman's or mare's\r\nmilk. An excess of casein, therefore, thrown on an already overtaxed\r\nstomach can all the more readily induce disorder. So it is with butter fat.\r\nWhile a most important element in nutrition, it may be present in the\r\nstomach in such quantity as to interfere with the action of the gastric\r\njuice on the casein, and with the interruption of the natural stomach\r\ndigestion the fats themselves undergo decomposition with the production of\r\noffensive and irritating fatty acids.\r\n\r\nThe milk of the very young cow is usually more watery than that of the\r\nmature animal, and that of the old cow has a greater liability to become\r\nacid. It varies much with the breed, the Channel Island cattle being\r\nnotorious for the relatively large quantity of cream, while the Holsteins,\r\nAyrshires, and Shorthorns are remarkable rather for the quantity of casein.\r\nThe milk of cows fed on potatoes and grass is very poor and watery; that\r\nfrom cows fed on cabbage or Swedish turnips has a disagreeable taste and\r\nodor (from the former an offensive liquid has been distilled).\r\n\r\nCows fed on overkept, fermented, and soured rations have acid milk, which\r\nreadily turns and coagulates. Thus old, long-kept brewer's grains, swill,\r\nthe refuse of glucose factories, and ensilage which has been put up too\r\ngreen all act in this way. The same may come from disease in the cow's\r\nudder, or any general disease of the cow with attendant fever, and in all\r\nsuch cases the tendency is to rapid change and unwholesomeness. If the milk\r\nis drawn and fed from a pail, there is the added danger of all sorts of\r\npoisonous ferments getting into it and multiplying; it may be from the\r\nimperfect cleansing and scalding of the pail; from rinsing the pails with\r\nwater that is impure; from the entrance of bacterial ferments floating in\r\nthe filthy atmosphere of the stable, or from the entrance of the volatile\r\nchemical products of fermentation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dangers coming through the milk, the calf suffers in its\r\ndigestive powers from any temporary illness, and among others from the\r\nexcitement attendant on the cutting of teeth, and impaired digestion means\r\nfermentations in the undigested masses and the excessive production of\r\npoisonous ptomaines and toxins.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the starting or predisposing cause of this malady, when\r\nonce established it is liable to perpetuate itself by contagion and to\r\nprove a veritable plague in a herd or a district.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of a diarrhea may appear so promptly after birth\r\nas to lead to the idea that the cause already existed in the body of the\r\ncalf, and it usually shows itself before the end of the second week. It may\r\nbe preceded by constipation, as in retained meconium, or by fetid\r\neructations and colicky pains, as in acute indigestion. The tail is stained\r\nby the liquid dejections, which are at first simply soft and mixed with\r\nmucus with a sour odor, accompanied with a peculiar and characteristic\r\nfetor (suggesting rotten cheese), which continually grows worse. The\r\nquantity of water and mucus steadily increases, the normal predominance of\r\nfatty matters becoming modified by the presence of considerable undigested\r\ncasein, which is not present in the normal feces, and in acute cases death\r\nmay result in one or two days from the combined drain on the system and the\r\npoisoning by the absorbed products of the decomposition in the stomach and\r\nbowels. When the case is prolonged the passages, at first 5 or 6 a day,\r\nincrease to 15 or 20, and pass with more and more straining, so that they\r\nare projected from the animal in a liquid stream. The color of the feces,\r\nat first yellow, becomes a lighter grayish yellow or a dirty white (hence\r\nthe name white scour), and the fetor becomes intolerable.\r\n\r\nAt first the calf retains its appetite, but as the severity of the disease\r\nincreases the animal shows less and less disposition to suck, and has lost\r\nall vivacity, lying dull and listless, and, when raised, walking weakly and\r\nunsteadily. Flesh is lost rapidly, the hair stands erect, the skin gets dry\r\nand scurfy, the nose is dry and hot, or this condition alternates with a\r\nmoist and cool one. By this time the mouth and skin, as well as the breath\r\nand dung, exhale the peculiar, penetrating, sour, offensive odor, and the\r\npoor calf has become an object of disgust to all that approach it. At\r\nfirst, and unless inflammation of the stomach and bowels supervenes (and\r\nunless the affection has started in indigestion and colic), the belly is\r\nnot bloated or painful on pressure, symptoms of acute colicky pains are\r\nabsent, and the bowels do not rumble; neither are bubbles of gas mingled\r\nwith the feces. The irritant products of the intestinal fermentations may,\r\nhowever, irritate and excoriate the skin around the anus, which becomes\r\nred, raw, and broken out in sores for some distance. Similarly the rectum,\r\nexposed by reason of the relaxed condition of the anus, or temporarily in\r\nstraining to pass the liquid dejection, is of a more or less deep red, and\r\nit may be ulcerated. Fever, with rapid pulse and increased breathing and\r\ntemperature, usually comes on with the very fetid character of the feces\r\nand is more pronounced as the bowels become inflamed, the abdomen sore to\r\nthe touch and tucked up, and the feces more watery and even mixed with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The prevention of these cases is the prevention of\r\nconstipation and indigestion, with all their varied causes as above\r\nenumerated, the selection of a strong, vigorous stock, and, above all, the\r\ncombating of contagion, especially in the separation of the sick from the\r\nhealthy, and in the thorough purification and disinfection of the\r\nbuildings. The cleansing and sweetening of all drains, the removal of dung\r\nheaps, and the washing and scraping of floors and walls, followed by a\r\nliberal application of chlorid of lime (bleaching powder), 4 ounces to the\r\ngallon, are indicated. Great care must be exercised in the feeding of the\r\ncow to have sound and wholesome feed and water, so apportioned as to make\r\nthe milk neither too rich nor too poor, and to her health, so that the calf\r\nmay be saved from the evil consequences of poisonous principles that may be\r\nproduced in the body of the cow. The calves should be carefully kept apart\r\nfrom all calving cows and their discharges. Similarly each calf must have\r\nspecial attention to see that its nurse gives milk which agrees with it,\r\nand that this is furnished at suitable times. If allowed to suck, it should\r\neither be left with the cow or be fed three times a day. If it becomes\r\nhungry twice a day, it is more liable to overload and derange the stomach,\r\nand if left too long hungry it is tempted to take in unsuitable and\r\nunwholesome feed, for which its stomach is as yet unprepared. So, if fed\r\nfrom the pail, it is safer to do so three times daily than twice. There\r\nshould be the utmost cleanliness of feeding dishes, and the feeder must be\r\never on the alert to prevent the strong and hungry from drinking the milk\r\nof the weaker in addition to their own. In case the cow nurse has been\r\nsubjected to any great excitement by reason of travel, hunting, or\r\ncarrying, the first milk she yields thereafter should be used for some\r\nother purpose and only the second allowed to the calf. Indeed, one and all\r\nof the conditions indicated above as causes should be judiciously guarded\r\nagainst.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment varies according to the nature and stage of the\r\ndisease. When the disease is not widespread, but isolated cases only occur,\r\nit may be assumed to be a simple diarrhea and is easily dealt with. The\r\nfirst object is to remove the irritant matter from stomach and bowels, and\r\nfor this 1 or 2 ounces of castor oil may be given, according to the size of\r\nthe calf. Reduce the milk by one-half or two-thirds. If the stools smell\r\nparticularly sour, the milk may be replaced by 1 ounce calcined magnesia,\r\nand in any case a tablespoonful or two of limewater must be given with each\r\nmeal. Great harm is often done by giving opium and astringents at the\r\noutset. These serve merely to bind up the bowels and retain the irritant\r\nsource of the trouble; literally, \"to shut up the wolf in the sheep-fold.\"\r\nWhen the offending agents have been expelled in this way, carminatives and\r\ndemulcent agents may be given--1 dram of anise water, 1 dram nitrate of\r\nbismuth, and 1 dram of gum arabic, three times a day. Under such course the\r\nconsistency of the stools should increase until in a day or two they become\r\nnatural.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the outbreak is more general and evidently the result of\r\ncontagion, the first consideration is to remove all sources of such\r\ncontamination. Test the milk of the cow with blue litmus paper; if it\r\nreddens, reject the milk until by sound, dry feeding, with perhaps a course\r\nof hyposulphite of soda and gentian root, the milk is made alkaline. The\r\ncastor oil or magnesia will be demanded to clear away the (now infecting)\r\nirritants, but they should be combined with antiseptics, and, while the\r\nlimewater and the carminative mixture may still be used, a most valuable\r\naddition will be found in the following: Calomel, 10 grains; prepared\r\nchalk, 1 ounce; creosote, 1 teaspoonful; mix, divide into 10 parts, and\r\ngive one four times a day. Or the following may be given four times a day:\r\nOne dram Dover's powder, 6 grains powdered ipecacuanha; mix, divide into 10\r\nequal parts. Injections of solutions of gum arabic are often useful, and if\r\nthe anus is red and excoriated, one-half dram of copperas may be added to\r\neach pint of the gummy solution. All the milk given must be boiled, and if\r\nthat does not agree, eggs made into an emulsion with barley water may be\r\nsubstituted. As the feces lose their watery character and become more\r\nconsistent, tincture of gentian in doses of 2 teaspoonfuls may be given\r\nthree or four times a day. Counter-irritants, such as mustard, ammonia, or\r\noil of turpentine, may be rubbed on the abdomen when it becomes tender to\r\nthe touch.\r\n\r\n\r\nACUTE CONTAGIOUS SCOURING IN THE NEWBORN.\r\n\r\nThe most violent and deadly form of diarrhea in the newborn calf deserves a\r\nspecial mention. This may appear immediately after birth, and shows itself\r\nalmost invariably within the first or second day. The most intense symptoms\r\nof white scour are complicated by great dullness, weakness, and\r\nprostration, sunken eyes, retracted belly, short, hurried breathing, and\r\nvery low temperature, the calf lying on its side, with the head resting on\r\nthe ground, lethargic and unconscious or regardless of all around it. The\r\nbowel discharges are profuse, yellowish white, and very offensive. As a\r\nrule death ensues within 24 to 36 hours.\r\n\r\nA marked characteristic of this form of illness is that it attacks almost\r\nevery calf born in the herd, or in the building, rather, and if the calf\r\nescapes an attack in the first two or three days of its life it usually\r\nsurvives. Those that recover from an attack, however, are liable one or two\r\nweeks later to suffer from an infective inflammation of the lungs. The\r\ninfection clings to a stable for years, in many cases rendering it\r\nimpossible to preserve and raise the calves. It has frequently coincided\r\nwith abortions and failures to conceive in the same herd, so that it has\r\nbeen thought that the same infective germ produces one type of abortion. On\r\nthe other hand, the removal of the calving cow from the herd to calve in a\r\nseparate building, hitherto unused and therefore uninfected, usually\r\neffects the escape and survival of the offspring.\r\n\r\nThe disease has been traced by Nocard and LigniËres to a small bacillus\r\nhaving the general characters of those that produce hemorrhagic septicemia,\r\nwhich is usually combined with a variety of others, but is in some cases\r\nalone and in pure culture, especially in the joints. The theory of\r\nLigniËres is that this bacillus is the primary offender, and that once\r\nintroduced it so depresses the vital powers of the system and tissue cells\r\nthat the healthy resistance to other bacteria is impaired or suspended, and\r\nhence the general and deadly invasion of the latter.\r\n\r\nInoculations with this bacillus killed guinea pigs or rabbits in 6 to 18\r\nhours, and calves in 30 hours, with symptoms and lesions of hemorrhagic\r\nsepticemia, including profuse fetid diarrhea.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of the early and deadly lesions in the alimentary tract\r\nwould seem to imply infection through the feed, and the promptitude of the\r\nattack after birth, together with the frequent coincidence of contagious\r\nabortion in the herd, suggest the presence of the germ in the cow; yet the\r\nescape of the calf when the cow calves in a fresh building is equally\r\nsuggestive of the infection through germs laid up in the building. This\r\nconclusion is further sustained by the observation that the bacillus\r\nevidently enters by the raw, unhealed navel, that it is diffused in the\r\nblood, and that a very careful preservation of the navel against infection\r\ngives immunity from attack.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The disease is so certainly and speedily fatal that it is\r\nhopeless to expect recovery, and therefore prevention is the rational\r\nresort.\r\n\r\nWhen a herd is small, the removal of the dam to a clean, unused stable a\r\nfew days before calving and her retention there for a week usually\r\nsucceeds. It is in the large herd that the disease is mainly to be dreaded,\r\nhowever, and in this it is impossible to furnish new and pure stables for\r\neach successive group of two or three calving cows. The thorough\r\ndisinfection of the general stable ought to succeed, yet I have seen the\r\ncleanest and purest stable repeatedly disinfected with corrosive sublimate\r\nwithout stopping the malady. It would appear as if the germ lodged on the\r\nsurface or in the bowels of the cow and tided the infection over the period\r\nof stable disinfection. Though insufficient of themselves, the supply of\r\nseparate calving boxes and the frequent thorough cleaning and disinfection\r\nof both these and the stables should not be neglected. The most important\r\nmeasure, however, is the disinfection of the navel.\r\n\r\nThe cow should be furnished with abundance of dry, clean bedding, sprinkled\r\nwith a solution of carbolic acid. As soon as calving sets in the tail and\r\nhips and anus and vulva should be sponged with a carbolic-acid solution\r\n(one-half ounce to the quart), and the vagina injected with a weaker\r\nsolution (2 drams to the quart). Fresh carbolized bedding should be\r\nconstantly supplied, so that the calf may be dropped on that and not on\r\nsoaked litter nor manure. The navel string should be at once tied with a\r\ncord that has been taken from a strong solution of carbolic acid. The stump\r\nof the cord and the adjacent skin should then be washed with the following\r\nsolution: Iodin, one-half dram; iodid of potassium, one-half dram; water, 1\r\nquart. When dry it may be covered with a coating of collodion or tar, each\r\ncontaining 1 per cent of iodin.\r\n\r\nWhenever a calf shows any sign of scouring it should be instantly removed\r\nto another pen and building, and the vacated one should be thoroughly\r\ncleaned and disinfected. Different attendants should take care of the sound\r\ncalves and the infected ones, and all utensils, litter, etc., kept\r\nscrupulously apart.\r\n\r\nAfter one week the healthy calves may usually be safely herded together, or\r\nthey may be safely placed in the cow stable.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER AILMENTS OF THE CALF.\r\n\r\nAmong these may be named several congenital imperfections, such as\r\nimperforate anus, vulva, or prepuce, which are to be recognized by the\r\ninability to pass dung or urine, in spite of straining, and the formation\r\nof swellings in the anus, vulva, or sheath. Each must be carefully incised\r\nwith the knife, taking care not to injure the muscles which circumscribe\r\nthe respective openings; also tongue-tie, in which the thin, flaccid,\r\nmucous membrane passing from the median line of the lower surface of the\r\ntongue binds the latter too closely to the floor of the mouth and renders\r\nthe tongue unfit for gathering in the food in after life. This must be cut\r\nwith knife or scissors, so as to give the tongue a reasonable degree of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nAPHTHA, or THRUSH, is another trouble of the sucking calf, showing itself\r\nas a white, curdy elevation on the tongue, lips, cheeks, or gums, and when\r\ndetached leaving a raw, red, angry surface. It is due to the growth of a\r\nvegetable parasite long recognized as the _OÔdium albicans_ (_Saccharomyces\r\nalbicans_). It is easily removed by rubbing with powdered borax, but\r\ninasmuch as other colonies are liable to start either in the mouth or in\r\nthe pharynx, gullet, or stomach, it is well to give a dose of one-half dram\r\nof hyposulphite of soda in water day by day for several days.\r\n\r\nRICKETS is not a common disease in calves, and comes on, if at all, later\r\nthan those we have been considering. It consists in softening and\r\nfriability of the bones from a deficiency of lime salts, and appears to be\r\nmainly connected with an inherited weakness of constitution, unsuitable\r\nfeeding, cold, close, damp buildings, microbian infection, and other\r\nconditions inimical to health. The prevention and treatment of rickets\r\nconsists essentially in the improvement of the digestion and general\r\nhealth; hence sunshine, open air, exercise, nourishing food, and tonics are\r\nindicated.

D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of the skeleton is advisable to facilitate the study of\r\ndiseases of bones and the accidental injuries to which they are exposed.\r\nThe skeleton of the adult ox is made up of the following number of bones:\r\n\r\n  Spinal column   45\r\n  Head            28\r\n  Chest           27\r\n  Shoulder         2-- 1 on each side.\r\n  Arm              2-- 1 on each side.\r\n  Forearm          4-- 2 on each side.\r\n  Forefoot        40--20 on each side.\r\n  Pelvis           2-- 1 on each side.\r\n  Thigh            2-- 1 on each side.\r\n  Leg              6-- 3 on each side.\r\n  Hind foot       38--19 on each side.\r\n                 ----\r\n  Total          196\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to burden the reader with the technical names and a\r\nscientific classification of each, it appears desirable to describe some of\r\nthe characteristics of forms in general and of a few classes into which\r\nthey may be divided, leaving the special study of individual bones to the\r\nillustrations of the skeleton (Pl. XXV), which will serve better than a\r\ngreat deal of writing to fix in the mind of the reader the location,\r\nrelation, and function of each one. In early fetal life the place of bone\r\nis supplied by temporary cartilage, which gradually changes to bone. For\r\nconvenience of study, bones may be said to be composed of a form of dense\r\nconnective tissue impregnated with lime salts and to contain two elementary\r\nconstituents--the organic or animal and the inorganic or earthy. In young\r\nanimals the former predominates; with increasing years the relative\r\nproportions of the two change, so that when advanced age is reached the\r\nproportion of inorganic far exceeds the organic. The gradual change with\r\nadvancing years from organic to inorganic has the effect of rendering the\r\nbone harder and more brittle, and though it is stronger, the reparative\r\nprocess is slower when injury does occur.\r\n\r\nThe bones are nourished in two ways: First, from the outside through their\r\ncovering, called the periosteum--the thin, strong membrane that covers\r\nevery part of the bone except the articular surface of the joints; and,\r\nsecond, from within through the minute branches of blood vessels which pass\r\ninto the bones through holes (foramina) on their surface and are\r\ndistributed in the soft structure (medulla) of the inside. The structure of\r\nthe bone is divided into two parts--the compact or hard material of the\r\noutside, which gives strength and is more abundant in the shafts of long\r\nbones, and the cancellated, softer tissue of the inside, which affords\r\naccommodation to the blood vessels necessary for the nourishment of that\r\npart of the structure.\r\n\r\nIn shape, bones are divided into three classes--long, flat, and short. The\r\nlong bones are the ribs and those mostly found in the limbs; the flat bones\r\nare found in the head, the shoulder, and the pelvis; the short bones in the\r\nspinal column and in the lower portions of the limbs.\r\n\r\nWith this little introduction, which seems almost indispensable, we will\r\nproceed at once to the consideration of diseases of bones, for they undergo\r\ndisease processes like any other living tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEITIS.\r\n\r\nInflammation of the compact structure of bones (osteitis) may be either\r\nacute or chronic, and may involve the whole extent of the bone affected or\r\nmay be confined to only a portion of it. This inflammation results from\r\ninjury, such as concussion, laceration, or a crushing bruise; also from\r\nspecific influences, as in actinomycosis (lumpy jaw) or cases of foul foot.\r\nThe latter affection frequently involves the bones, and for this reason the\r\npastern is the most frequent seat of osteitis. There is dull pain on\r\npressure and a painful swelling of bone when pus is present. Suppuration\r\nmay involve the overlying soft tissues, causing an abscess, which may\r\nfinally break through the skin. The inflammatory condition sometimes\r\nassumes an ulcerated form (caries) or from interrupted nutrition of the\r\npart deprived of the blood necessary to its nourishment may cause death of\r\na large section of bone (necrosis); this dead fragment (sequestrum),\r\nbecoming separated from the main portion of bone, acts as a foreign body.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This consists in resting the affected part and in giving vent\r\nat the earliest possible moment to whatever pus may be present. Free\r\ndrainage should then be maintained. Apply dressings of lactic acid or\r\ninject with 5 per cent zinc-chlorid solution and pack with tampons of\r\ncotton soaked in antiseptic solutions. A laxative to keep the bowels moving\r\nfreely is the only internal treatment necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIOSTITIS.\r\n\r\nThis disease is an inflammation of the external covering of bone\r\n(periosteum) and is usually produced by wounds, pressure, or crushing the\r\npart. The periosteum is well supplied with sensitive nerve endings and when\r\ninflamed is very sensitive to pressure and may cause lameness. This\r\ncondition is often difficult to determine, and even an acute observer may\r\nfail to locate the point of its existence. There are three forms of\r\nperiostitis--aseptic, purulent, and fibrous.\r\n\r\nASEPTIC PERIOSTITIS when it becomes chronic causes such a bony enlargement\r\n(exostosis) as is seen in the callous formation following the fracture of a\r\nbone. The formation of such a tumor or enlargement on the surface of a bone\r\nis liable to occur in any part of the bone covered with periosteum, and\r\nwhen found near a joint involving two or more bones it is liable to result\r\nin their union (anchylosis).\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Applications of cold water to check the inflammatory\r\nprocesses is indicated for the first few days in aseptic periostitis,\r\nfollowed by hot fomentations to hurry resorption of fluids. Massage should\r\nthen be given with camphor ointment, mercurial ointment, soap liniment, or\r\nLugol's solution. In the chronic form point firing or a biniodid-of-mercury\r\nblister will be found beneficial.\r\n\r\nPURULENT PERIOSTITIS follows wounds which reach the periosteum and become\r\ninfected, as observed in compound fractures, or it may result from\r\nadvancing purulent conditions in neighboring structures, as in foul foot.\r\nIt may also occur in the course of an infectious disease, when small\r\nabscesses are formed under the periosteum (subperiosteal abscess). It may\r\nlead to necrosis of the bone or a fistulous tract from the bone to the\r\nsurface. There is usually much pain and fever, and the odor from the wound\r\nis offensive.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In this form of periostitis the periosteum should be freely\r\nincised, followed either by continuous irrigation or frequent injection of\r\nthe wound with antiseptic solutions.\r\n\r\nFIBROUS PERIOSTITIS.--This form of the disease consists in the thickening\r\nof the outer layer of the periosteum from the inflammation reaching it from\r\nneighboring structures. This newly formed fibrous tissue may become\r\nossified or may transmit the inflammation to the deeper bony structures. It\r\nis frequently seen in cases in which there has been an intense inflammation\r\nof the skin close to an underlying bone.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment should be the same as that recommended for\r\naseptic periostitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOMYELITIS.\r\n\r\nThis term refers to an inflammation of the bone marrow, which is most\r\ncommonly seen following the bacterial infection of a compound fracture and\r\nusually results in pus formation. The bone is melted away and pus escapes\r\nfrom the bone under the periosteum, involving the soft tissues. It is\r\nprincipally confined to the long bones and seldom affects more than one.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The bone should be opened for the purpose of curetting out\r\nthe diseased portion of the marrow cavity and removing all the necrotic\r\npieces of bone. This should be undertaken only by a competent veterinarian.\r\nThe after-treatment consists in tamponing the wound with pledgets of\r\niodoform gauze or a mixture of iodoform 1 part and glycerin 4 parts. The\r\nwound in the soft tissue should be kept open until the cavity in the bone\r\nhas filled with granulation tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\nRICKETS.\r\n\r\nThis disease, also called \"rachitis,\" is an inflammatory affection of\r\nyoung, growing bones, and mostly involves the ribs and long bones of the\r\nlegs. It consists in a failure of the organism to deposit lime salts in\r\nbone, and for this reason the bones do not ossify so rapidly as they\r\nshould. The cartilaginous ends of the bones grow rapidly, but ossification\r\ndoes not keep pace with it. The bones become long and their ends bend at\r\nthe joints, the legs become crooked, and the joints are large and\r\nirregular. All the bones affected with this disease are thicker than\r\nnormal, and the gait of the animal is stiff and painful. A row of bony\r\nenlargements may be found where the ribs articulate with the cartilages\r\nconnecting them with the breastbone and is called the \"beaded line.\" A\r\ncatarrhal condition of the digestive tract is usually observed. The disease\r\nmay result from an inherited weakness of constitution, poor hygienic\r\nsurroundings, or improper diet. Calves and foals are less frequently\r\naffected with rickets than dogs and pigs.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The affected animal should have nourishing feed containing a\r\nproper quantity of lime salts. Outdoor exercise and plenty of fresh air are\r\nindispensable. Limewater should be given once daily for drinking purposes\r\nand ground bone meal mixed with the food. Phosphorus, one-fortieth of a\r\ngrain, and calcium phosphate, 1 dram, given twice daily to a 2-month-old\r\ncalf, and proportionally increased for older animals, has proved\r\nefficacious in this disease. In some cases the long bones of the limbs are\r\ntoo weak at birth to support the weight of the animal, and temporary\r\nsplints, carefully padded and wrapped on with some soft bandages, become\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOMALACIA (CREEPS).\r\n\r\nThis is a condition of bone brittleness or softening of bone found usually\r\nin adult life. It consists in the decalcification of mature bone, with the\r\nadvancing diminution of the compact portion of bone by absorption. The\r\nperiosteum strips very easily from the bone. This disease is seen in milch\r\ncows during the period of heavy lactation or in the later stages of\r\npregnancy, and the greater the yield of milk the more rapid the progress of\r\nthe disease. Heifers with their first calves are frequently affected, as\r\nthese animals require a considerable quantity of mineral salts for their\r\nown growth and for the nourishment of their offspring.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In marked cases there is a gradual emaciation and symptoms of\r\ngastrointestinal catarrh, with depraved appetite, the animal eating manure,\r\ndecayed wood, dirt, leather, etc. Muscular weakness is prominent, together\r\nwith muscle tremors, which simulate chills, but are not accompanied with\r\nany rise of temperature. The animal has a stiff, laborious gait; there is\r\npain and swelling of the joints, and constant shifting of the weight from\r\none leg to another. The restricted movements of the joints are frequently\r\naccompanied with a crackling sound, which has caused the name of \"creeps\"\r\nto be applied to the disease. The coat is dull and rough and the skin dry\r\nand hidebound. The animal is subject to frequent sprains or fracture of\r\nbones without apparent cause, as in lying down or turning around, and when\r\nsuch fractures occur they are difficult to unite. The bones principally\r\ninvolved are the upper bones of the legs, the haunch bone, and the middle\r\nbones of the spinal column. The disease in this country is confined to\r\nlocalized areas in the Southwest, known as the \"alkali districts,\" and in\r\nthe old dairy sections of New York State. The cause of this affection is\r\nthe insufficiency of lime salts in the food, also to feeding hay of low,\r\ndamp pastures, kitchen slops, and potatoes, or to overstocking lands. It\r\noccurs on old, worn-out soil poor in lime salts, and has also been observed\r\nto follow a dry season.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This should consist in a change of feed and the artificial\r\nfeeding of lime salts, such as magnesium and sodium phosphate. Feed rich in\r\nmineral salts may be given, such as beans, cowpeas, oats, cottonseed meal,\r\nor wheat bran. Cottonseed meal is one of the best feeds for this purpose,\r\nbut it should be fed carefully, as too large quantities of it are injurious\r\nto cows. Phosphorus may also be given in one-fourth grain doses twice\r\ndaily, together with a tablespoonful of powdered bone meal or crude calcium\r\nphosphate at each meal. Ordinary lime dissolved in drinking water\r\n(limewater) will also be found efficacious in combating this disease, and\r\ncan be provided at slight expense. A change of pasture to a locality where\r\nthe disease is unknown and a free supply of common salt and bone meal will\r\nbe the most convenient method of treating range cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS.\r\n\r\nThe most common accident occurring to bones and joints is a sprain of the\r\nligaments uniting the bones, or the tendons uniting the muscles and bones.\r\nA sprain is the result of a sudden forcing of a joint in an unnatural\r\ndirection, or, if in a natural direction, beyond the power of the ligament\r\nor tendon to restrain it properly, so that part of the fibers of either are\r\nruptured. When such an accident occurs pain is immediately inflicted,\r\nvarying in degree with the extent of the injury, which is soon followed by\r\nswelling, with more or less heat and tenderness. If the seat of the injury\r\nbe in any of the limbs, lameness is likely to result. Of the causes of\r\nsprain, slipping on ice or a wet floor, playing, and fighting with another\r\nanimal are the most common.\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE SHOULDER JOINT.--This is liable to occur from any of the\r\ncauses mentioned above or from the animal slipping suddenly into a rut or\r\nhole. When such an accident occurs, sudden lameness will attract attention.\r\nThe animal will be noticed to drag the leg when walking and to carry it in\r\na circular direction, outward and forward, at each step. The leg should be\r\ncarefully examined, pressure over the joint causing the animal to evince\r\npain. If the person making the examination is in doubt, it is well to make\r\na comparison between the shoulders by pressing first on one and then the\r\nother. After such an accident the animal should be tied up so as to limit\r\nso far as possible the use of the injured joint.\r\n\r\nSoft feed should be given with a view of keeping the bowels acting freely.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--During the first three days the treatment should consist of\r\ncold-water irrigation to check the inflammation and relieve the pain. Hot\r\nfomentations may then be applied to hasten the absorption of the\r\ninflammatory fluids. When the pain has somewhat abated, equal parts of\r\nmercurial ointment and green soap may be rubbed into the swollen tissue.\r\nShould lameness continue after the tenth day, good results will be obtained\r\nfrom the application of a blister. This may be done by carefully clipping\r\noff the hair over the joint, including a surface of 4 or 5 inches in\r\ncircumference, and rubbing in the following preparation:\r\n\r\n  Powdered cantharides   dram   1\r\n  Biniodid of mercury     do    1\r\n  Vaseline              ounce   1\r\n\r\nThe animal's head should be carefully tied until the third day, to prevent\r\nits licking the blister. The blistered surface should then be smeared with\r\nlard or vaseline every other day until the scabs fall off. Gentle exercise\r\nshould be allowed after the fourth or fifth day from the application of the\r\nblister. If the lameness still remains the blister may be repeated in three\r\nweeks or a month.\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE FETLOCK.--This may occur from misstep when the animal is\r\nmoving rapidly, and the twisting or wrenching of the foot is sufficient to\r\nrupture partially the ligaments which bind the bones together at that part.\r\nSuch an accident also frequently occurs by the foot getting fastened in a\r\nhole in the floor; the wrenching is the result of the animal's attempt to\r\nliberate it. Lameness, followed by swelling of the joint and pain when it\r\nis handled, or when the animal moves the joint, and heat, are the more\r\nnoticeable symptoms. If the sprain is very severe, the animal occasionally\r\ndoes not bear its weight on the limb.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The most important consideration in the treatment of this\r\naffection is rest, which is best enforced by keeping the animal in the\r\nstall and placing strong, muslin bandages about the inflamed joint. As in\r\nthe sprain of the shoulder, cold water in the form of douches, continuous\r\nirrigation with hose or soaking tub, or finely chopped ice poultices are\r\nindicated for the first three days. Following this apply a Priessnitz\r\nbandage[2] moderately tight about the joint, which not only conduces to\r\nrest, but also favors absorption. Massage with stimulating liniments, such\r\nas soap or camphor, may later be applied to the affected parts.\r\n\r\nIf the lameness has not disappeared by the tenth day, the blister advised\r\nfor the sprain of the shoulder should be applied and the same precautions\r\nobserved as to tying the animal's head and subsequent smearing with\r\nvaseline. When a blister is applied in this locality, the back part of the\r\nheel should be first filled with lard or vaseline, and care taken to\r\nprevent any of the blistering preparation from coming in contact with the\r\nskin of that part. If this precaution is not observed, scratches may ensue\r\nand prove troublesome.\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE HIP.--This is liable to result from the animal's slipping in\r\nsuch way as to spread the hind feet wide apart. The patient goes stiff in\r\nthe hind legs, or lame in one hind leg, walking with a straddling gait and\r\nswinging the leg outward as it is carried forward. Tenderness may\r\noccasionally be detected on pressure, but owing to the heavy covering of\r\nmuscles outside the joint this test is not always reliable.\r\n\r\nIn the acute cases give rest and cold local applications. After the fourth\r\nor fifth day the blister mentioned for sprain of the shoulder may be\r\napplied with advantage, and if this proves insufficient, as a last resort\r\nwe may fire in points over the joint.\r\n\r\nSPRAIN OF THE BACK.--Sprain of the back, particularly in the region of the\r\nloins, is not an uncommon accident among cattle. It is liable to occur from\r\nthe animals slipping with both hind feet sidewise so as to twist the back,\r\nor from slipping violently backward so that great stress is thrown on the\r\nloins. The patient moves with difficulty, using the hind parts in a guarded\r\nmanner, as if afraid of causing severe pain. Occasionally, if the sprain is\r\nsevere, the animal will rise with difficulty. Pressure on the back in the\r\nimmediate region of the loins causes pain. Such cases may be mistaken for\r\nparalysis, and, in fact, in severe cases, during the early stages of the\r\ninjury, although the nerve supply is not interfered with, the injury to the\r\nmuscles and resulting pain is so great that the condition is almost equal\r\nto paralysis, although liable to be attended with more favorable results.\r\nHot applications, such as blankets wrung out of hot water and changed\r\noften, will be likely to afford relief during the earlier stages.\r\nAfterwards the blister mentioned for sprain of the shoulder may be applied\r\nwith advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURES (BROKEN BONES).\r\n\r\nBones may be accidentally broken in many ways and from different causes.\r\nFractures in general are liable to be produced by external force suddenly\r\nand violently applied, either directly to the part or at a distance, the\r\nforce being transmitted through the stronger bones until it expends itself\r\nby breaking a weaker one remote from the seat of the injury. Occasionally\r\nviolent contraction of muscles is sufficient to break a bone. Certain\r\nbones, those of the limbs in particular, owing to their exposed position,\r\nare more liable to fracture than others. Owing to certain predisposing\r\ncauses, such as age, habit, or hereditary constitutional weakness, the\r\nbones of some animals are more easily fractured than those of others. The\r\nbones of an animal advanced in years are more subject to fracture because\r\nof the preponderance of inorganic matter rendering them more brittle. They\r\nare also occasionally rendered liable to fracture by a previously existing\r\ndiseased condition. Fractures are divided into four classes--partial,\r\nsimple, compound, and comminuted.\r\n\r\nPARTIAL FRACTURES.--Partial fractures are those which are liable to occur\r\nin a young animal in which the preponderance of animal matter or the\r\nsemicartilaginous condition of the bone renders it tough, so that even when\r\nconsiderable force is applied the bone bends, breaking on the side opposite\r\nthat to which the force was applied, after the manner in which a green\r\nstick bends and breaks.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE FRACTURES. Simple fracture is one in which the bone is severed in\r\ntwo parts, transversely, longitudinally, or obliquely, without serious\r\ninjury to the adjoining structures.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND FRACTURES.--Compound fracture is one in which there is an open\r\nwound permitting the air to communicate with the ends of the broken bones.\r\n\r\nCOMMINUTED FRACTURES.--Comminuted fracture is one in which the bone is\r\nshattered or divided into a number of fragments.\r\n\r\nCOMPLICATED FRACTURES.--Complicated fracture is one in which other\r\nstructures surrounding the bones are injured.\r\n\r\nGENERAL SYMPTOMS OF FRACTURE.--When a fracture of one or more of the large\r\nbones of a limb occurs, symptoms are sure to be well marked. After the\r\naccident the animal refuses to touch the foot to the ground and, if\r\ncompelled to move, does so with great pain and reluctance. There is more or\r\nless shortening of the limb, with trembling of the muscles in the vicinity\r\nof the injury; deformity, and increased mobility, so that, instead of the\r\nnatural joints of the limb and the natural, muscular control of their\r\nmotion, a new joint, over which the animal has no control, is formed where\r\nthe fracture occurred. As the leg, shortened by the ends of the bones being\r\nforced past one another from the muscular contraction which invariably\r\ntakes place, hangs dependent from the body it swings in an awkward and\r\nunnatural manner, permitting the toe and foot to assume positions in their\r\nrelations to other parts of the body which otherwise would be impossible.\r\nIf the fractured bone is so situated that the parts may be moved one upon\r\nanother, a grating sound, known as crepitus, will be heard.\r\n\r\nGENERAL TREATMENT OF FRACTURES.--When a fracture occurs, the advisability\r\nof attempting treatment must first be determined. If the animal is young,\r\nvaluable, and of reasonably quiet temperament, and the fracture is not too\r\ngreat in extent, the chances of recovery are fair. On the other hand, if\r\nthe animal should be of little value, irritable, advanced in years, and the\r\nfracture is a serious compound or comminuted one, the wiser course would\r\ngenerally be to put the creature out of its misery.\r\n\r\nHaving determined to attempt treatment, no time should be lost in restoring\r\nthe parts as nearly as possible to their natural position and retaining\r\nthem there. If the ends of the bones have been drawn one past the other,\r\nthey should be drawn out by firm and continuous tension, until they again\r\nassume the position in which they were before the accident. All this can\r\nbetter be done before the swelling (which is sure to result) takes place.\r\nIf the swelling has occurred before the injury is noticed, do not attempt\r\nto treat it, but proceed at once to treat the fracture as though the\r\nswelling were not present, for no step can be taken toward recovery until\r\nthe ends of the bone have been restored to their proper position. When that\r\nis done and proper appliances have been used to prevent them from being\r\nagain misplaced, the swelling, which is the result of irritation, will be\r\nrelieved. In selecting the appliances to be used in the treatment of\r\nfracture the judgment and ingenuity of the operator are of much importance.\r\nSplints, made of wood shaped to fit the limb and padded with soft material\r\nwhere they come in contact with bony prominences, and held in position by\r\nmeans of bandages, are the oldest method, and with some are still most\r\npopular. The fracture pads used in human surgery, and for sale in surgical\r\ndepots, are very convenient. After being dipped in water they may be molded\r\nto fit the limb and be retained by means of bandages. Heavy sole leather\r\nis also used after being soaked in warm water and molded to the shape of\r\nthe limb and holes cut in it to fit over any sharp irregularities in the\r\nnatural shape of the bones. Gutta-percha sheets are also used and answer\r\nwell. They are prepared and used in the same way as the leather.\r\n\r\nAnother and perhaps the simplest of all methods is the application of a\r\nplaster-of-Paris bandage, which is made as follows: Strips of thin\r\ncheesecloth 3 inches wide and 8 or 9 feet long are laid flat on a board and\r\non them is spread a layer of plaster of Paris about one-eighth of an inch\r\nthick; then, starting at one end, roll carefully so as to gather the\r\nplaster in between the layers of the bandage. It is of course important\r\nthat the cloth be thin and the plaster of Paris fresh and active. After\r\npreparing four or five of such bandages the operator is ready to dress the\r\nfracture, which, after the parts have been brought into position, should be\r\ndone by covering all that part of the limb to which the plaster-of-Paris\r\nbandage is to be applied with a single layer of the dry bandage, letting it\r\nextend both above and below the part to which the plaster bandage is to be\r\napplied and including under the folds of the dry bandage at each end a\r\nlayer of absorbent cotton, which is intended to form a pad to prevent the\r\nends of the plaster bandage from chafing the skin beneath. When this is\r\ndone one of the plaster bandages should be placed in a vessel of water and\r\nallowed to remain till the air bubbles have ceased to rise from it, which\r\nwill generally indicate that it is soaked through. Then, taking it in the\r\nhand, wind it carefully around and around the limb, unrolling the bandage\r\nas it is wound around the limb, occasionally smoothing down the plaster of\r\nParis. Should it form roughly or in ridges the hand may be dipped in water\r\nto impart increased moisture to it. When about finished with one bandage,\r\nplace another one in the water, so that the winding operation may be\r\ncontinued without delay. The bandages should be applied till the cast is\r\nfrom one-half to three-quarters of an inch thick, then gently restrain the\r\nanimal for one-half or three-quarters of an hour till the plaster is\r\nhardened. Any of the appliances used should be so manipulated as to prevent\r\nabsolutely any motion of the detached parts. If the fracture is near a\r\njoint, it is generally best to include the joint in the appliance. The part\r\nof the limb below the bandage should be carefully and firmly wrapped with\r\nan ordinary cotton bandage all the way from the plaster bandage down to the\r\nhoof. This last bandage will tend to prevent swelling, which is liable to\r\noccur, the result of the dependent position in which the animal is forced\r\nby nature to keep the injured limb.\r\n\r\nWhen plaster-of-Paris bandages are applied to a compound fracture the\r\ninjured part may be previously dressed with a small, thick pad of cotton\r\nimmediately over the wound. In applying the bandage the operator may with a\r\nlittle care so arrange it as to keep the folds of the bandages off the\r\ncotton, or have only a thin layer over it, which may be easily cut out and\r\nthe cotton removed, leaving a convenient opening through which to dress the\r\nwound without removing the bandage. The ends of the bandage or other\r\nappliance should be carefully watched to see that the skin does not become\r\nchafed, particularly at the lower end. If the bandage should become weak or\r\nbroken at any part, it may be strengthened without removal by applying\r\nother bandages immediately over it. If swelling has taken place before the\r\nbandage has been applied, there is liable to be some loosening as it\r\ndisappears, and even without the swelling there may be a tendency of the\r\nbandage to slide downward. This may be overcome by fastening it to a\r\nsuspender attached to a surcingle or passed over the body and attached to\r\nthe opposite leg. If the looseness can not be overcome in this way, the\r\nspace may be filled by pouring in a thin paste of plaster of Paris. A\r\nbetter method, however, is to remove the bandage and apply another. Owing\r\nto the hardness of the bandage it will be removed with some difficulty. A\r\ndeep groove should be cut down completely through it on the opposite sides.\r\nThis may be done with a chisel and a small hammer if the bandage is\r\ncarefully held by an assistant so that the concussion of the blows is not\r\ntransmitted to the injured bones. The patient should have a roomy stall,\r\nand should be tied by the head to prevent any attempts to move around. In\r\nsome cases slings have been used. Ordinarily, however, they are not\r\nsatisfactory in cattle practice, and if applied should be for only a few\r\ndays at a time, and with a view to lessen the animal's disposition to lie\r\ndown, rather than to prevent it. When they are used continuously the\r\npressure on the abdomen may interfere with digestion and the general health\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\n_Modes of union._--The animal should be kept as quiet as possible and given\r\nsuch feed as will have a tendency to keep the bowels slightly relaxed. The\r\nsuccess of the operation depends chiefly on the skill of the operator, but\r\nnot alone in the selection and use of the appliances, for as much attention\r\nmust be given to subsequent management. The patients are restless, and a\r\nsingle awkward motion may undo the work of weeks so far as the union of the\r\nparts of the bone is concerned. Union takes place after the same process\r\nand, if the conditions are favorable, with greater rapidity than in the\r\nhuman being. The injury that caused the fracture is almost sure to have\r\nextended to some of the adjacent tissues, and even though the fracture may\r\nbe of the simplest type there is almost sure to be considerable hemorrhage\r\naround the ends of the broken bone. This, however, is unimportant if the\r\nskin remains intact, unless a very large vessel should be injured, or the\r\nfracture should open some of the important cavities of the body, in which\r\ncase a fatal hemorrhage may result. If, on the other hand, the fracture is\r\ncompound the external opening furnishes a fertile field for the lodgment of\r\ndisease-producing germs.\r\n\r\nUnless great care is taken in such cases, a suppurative process is liable\r\nto be established which will seriously interfere with, if not entirely\r\narrest, the process of union between the bones; or it may become so serious\r\nas to endanger the general health of the animal and even be attended with\r\nfatal results. This last danger is greater if the injury has occurred to\r\nthe bones of the arm or thigh. In such cases, owing to the dense covering\r\nof fascia which ensheathes the muscular covering pus is liable to be\r\nimprisoned, and, burrowing downward, saturate the whole structure, not only\r\nendangering the limb, but, by absorption, may set up blood poisoning and\r\nseriously interfere with the general health of the patient, even to causing\r\ndeath. In order so far as possible to prevent such an unfortunate\r\ncomplication, the wound should be carefully cleansed with a mild solution\r\nof carbolic acid, then dusted over with iodoform before the bandages are\r\napplied, and cleansed and dressed daily in the same way. After dressing,\r\nalways cover with absorbent cotton. In the early process of union an\r\nexudation of lymph takes place, which is at first fluid, gradually becoming\r\nthicker and firmer till it forms a callus, known as the external or\r\nensheathing callus, in the shape of a ring or ferrule surrounding the\r\ndetached portions of the bone. It occasionally happens that this callus\r\nforms only at the ends of the bones, filling the spaces that exist between\r\nthem, when it is known as the intermediate callus. The process of union may\r\nbe divided into five stages. In the first stage, including the first eight\r\ndays, the detached portions of the bone and the sharp projections that are\r\nnot sufficiently nourished are absorbed; the blood which escaped into the\r\nsurrounding tissues, the result of the injury, is gradually absorbed, and\r\nthe effused lymph, which is ultimately to constitute the temporary\r\ncartilage, takes it place. In the second stage, from the tenth to the\r\ntwentieth day, the tumor or callus is formed and fibrocartilage is\r\ndeveloped inside and around the exposed end of the bone. In the third\r\nstage, extending from the twentieth to the fortieth or fiftieth day,\r\naccording to the age and strength of the animal, the fibrocartilaginous\r\nstructure undergoes a change and is gradually converted into bone, forming\r\na ferrule on the outside and a plug on the inside, which serve to hold the\r\npart in position. In the fourth stage, extending to about the sixth month,\r\nthe whole of the new structure is converted into bone. In the fifth stage,\r\nextending to the end of the first year, the callus is absorbed, being no\r\nlonger necessary, and the connection between the cavities of the two bones\r\nis again established.\r\n\r\n_Common complications._--The process of union just described is healthy and\r\nnormal. Diseased conditions may at any time supervene during the treatment\r\nand render the operation unsuccessful. In the case of compound fracture,\r\nthe open wound communicating with the ends of the bones, a septic condition\r\nis liable to arise which may become so serious as to endanger the animal's\r\nlife and bring about conditions which in human surgery would indicate\r\namputation. Although that operation is not a general one in veterinary\r\npractice, there is no reason why it should not be attempted as a last\r\nresort, particularly if the animal is valuable or is one whose existence is\r\nnecessary in order to perpetuate some valuable strain. Even in the simplest\r\nform of fracture, if the splints or bandages are improperly applied and the\r\nfractured bone left so loosely guarded that the broken ends move one upon\r\nanother, the formation of the calluses previously described is liable to be\r\ninterfered with, and in place of a strong, rigid, and healthy union a\r\nformation of elastic cartilage is the result. This false structure unites\r\nthe broken ends of the bones in such way that they move one upon another,\r\ndepriving the bone of its stability and usefulness. When once the healthy\r\nprocess of union is interrupted in the manner just described, it is again\r\nestablished with great difficulty. It no longer does any good to continue\r\nthe restraining power; in fact, the change of the temporary cartilage into\r\nbone is more liable to be reestablished if the parts move violently upon\r\neach other for a short time so as to set up and renew the process of\r\ninflammation. Then if the restraint is again applied there is some chance\r\nof union. In order so far as possible to avoid this danger, care should be\r\ntaken to see that the bandage fits closely and that it is kept on till\r\nthere is no longer any danger but that a perfect union has taken place. It\r\nis impossible to say at just what time the splints or bandages can safely\r\nbe removed. In a young and healthy animal of quiet temperament, if the\r\nparts have been firmly held in position throughout the whole time, from 30\r\nto 40 days may be regarded as reasonably safe. Under more unfavorable\r\nconditions as to age, vitality, and restraint, the period would better be\r\nextended to 60 days, if the general condition of the animal is such as to\r\npermit of so long a continuance. After the appliance has been removed the\r\nanimal should be allowed to stand quiet for a few days, then be given very\r\ngentle exercise, gradually increased for a week or 10 days, by which time\r\nthe patient will be so far recovered as to be placed in pasture. It should,\r\nhowever, be alone for a time, so as not to take any chance of injury from\r\nfighting or other accidents that association with other animals might\r\ninvolve.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL FRACTURES.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE HORNS.--Of the special fractures liable to occur, that of\r\nthe horn is perhaps the most common. It is always the result of violent\r\nmechanical means, such as blows, injury occurring while fighting, or from\r\nthe animal getting its head locked in some manner while feeding from a\r\nrack. When it occurs there are two ways in which the injury may affect the\r\nanimal. First and most common, the horny crust is liable to be stripped\r\nfrom the bony projection which it covers. Second, the crust and bone may\r\nboth be broken or bent down, the fracture occurring in that case at the\r\nroot of the horn and involving part of the bones of the head in the\r\nimmediate vicinity. In the first case, if the horny covering is knocked\r\noff, little attention is necessary. The animal may be relieved from\r\nsuffering if the stump is smeared with pine tar and wrapped in cloth. If\r\nthe core is much lacerated, perhaps it would be better to amputate. The\r\nnecessity for such operation must be determined by the condition of the\r\ninjury, influenced to some extent by the owner's ideas on the subject. When\r\nthe operation is performed, it should be done with a sharp, fine-toothed\r\nsaw, and by sawing the horn off close enough to include a little of the\r\nskin and hair around its base. The practice of dehorning has grown popular\r\nin many parts of the country. It is a simple operation, and, although\r\nattended with some immediate suffering, does not produce serious\r\nconstitutional disturbance. The advisability of performing the operation on\r\nall cattle is a question of expediency and must be justified by the\r\nexpectation of benefit on the part of the feeder. If the horn should be\r\nbroken so that the core and crust are bent out of shape without the\r\ndetachment of one from the other, it may be restored to its normal position\r\nand retained there by means of a splint made to fit across the back of the\r\nhead, so as to be laced to both horns, the sound horn serving to hold the\r\nbroken one in position. Such a splint may be fastened on by means of either\r\na wire or cord and allowed to remain six weeks or two months.\r\n\r\nIf both the horn and core have been broken off, bleeding is usually severe\r\nand should be checked by astringents, such as alum, or by pressure. After\r\nthe hemorrhage has ceased the exposed portion of the fracture should be\r\ncovered with pine tar, with or without a bandage. An imperfect growth of\r\nhorn will in due time cover the exposed bone.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE BONES OF THE FACE.--These occasionally occur, and when\r\nover the cavities of the nose produce depression, disfigurement, and\r\nimpeded respiration, owing to the lessening of the caliber of the nasal\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nWhen such accident occurs, the depressed bone should be gently forced back\r\nto place by introducing the finger in the nostril, or if the fracture is\r\ntoo far up for this, a probe may be passed and the parts retained by\r\nplacing immediately over it a plaster of thin leather or strong canvas\r\nsmeared with tar, extending out to the sound surroundings, taking care to\r\nembed the hair over the fractured portion in the tar of the plaster, so\r\nthat it will be firmly held and prevented from again becoming depressed. If\r\nonly one nostril is involved, the depressed portion may be held in position\r\nby packing that nostril with absorbent cotton. This practice, however, has\r\nthe objection of giving the animal great discomfort and in some cases a\r\ndisposition to aggravate the injury.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE SKULL (CRANIUM).--Fractures of the bones forming the cavity\r\nin which the brain is situated are, owing to their strength, comparatively\r\nrare among cattle. Such an accident can only be the result of external\r\nviolence, and it is hardly possible that it could occur without some\r\nfragment of the broken bone pressing upon the brain so as to cause coma or\r\nother severe nervous derangement, or even death.\r\n\r\nIf the animal survives the first shock, the efforts should be directed\r\ntoward relieving the pressure, which may be done by making an opening in\r\nthe bone (trephining), and with a hook drawing the depressed part outward.\r\nInterference is not so liable to be attended with good results as to be\r\nwarranted in all cases. The effects of a very severe shock which may not\r\nhave produced a fracture, although the symptoms were alarming, will in many\r\ncases pass off, leaving the animal in a better condition than if an\r\noperation had been performed.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE LOWER JAW.--This occasionally occurs, and is more liable to\r\nresult from the kick of a horse than from any other cause. The front part\r\nof the jaw may be split or shattered in any direction in which the force\r\nmay have been applied. Bloody discharges from the mouth and failure to eat\r\nor ruminate are symptoms most likely to attract attention.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is simple and consists in first removing detached pieces of\r\nbone, then drawing the parts together and retaining them by means of pieces\r\nof copper wire fastened around the teeth, and feeding the animal on sloppy\r\nfeed until recovery takes place. The wound should be dressed once or twice\r\na day with a 3 per cent solution of carbolic acid, forced gently in with a\r\nsyringe, so as to remove any feed which may have become impacted and\r\ninterfere with the healing process.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE VERTEBRA (SPINAL COLUMN).--This is not so common among\r\ncattle as other animals. If the fracture should be through the body of the\r\nbone, there may be pressure on or laceration of the spinal cord, causing\r\nparalysis of all parts posterior to the seat of injury. Fractures of the\r\nprominences on a vertebra occasionally occur without interfering with the\r\ncanal in which the spinal cord is situated. Such accidents are liable to\r\npass unnoticed, for, although the animal may suffer considerable pain, it\r\nmay not be manifested in such way as to attract attention, and the deep\r\ncovering of muscles serves effectually to conceal the injury. When the\r\nfracture occurs in the upper part of the neck, paralysis of the muscles\r\nused in respiration must result, and death from asphyxia very shortly\r\nensues. The more common accident is to the loins, and when a fracture of\r\nthe body of a vertebra occurs in this region so as to produce pressure on\r\nthe spinal cord, paralysis of the hind legs and quarters is the result.\r\nDiagnosis of such an accident is more difficult than in the case of any\r\nother fracture. The parts can not be moved one upon another so that\r\ncrepitus is noticeable. The heavy coating of muscles conceals\r\nirregularities of shape, which otherwise may attract attention. About the\r\nonly reliable symptom is paralysis or loss of use and sensation of the\r\nparts posterior to the injury. Careful examination may reveal the seat of\r\nthe injury. If it was the result of a blow, there may be some abrasion of\r\nthe skin. The diagnosis is only important as an aid in determining the\r\nproper course to pursue.\r\n\r\nIf paralysis is present and a depression or irregularity of the spinal\r\ncolumn is so apparent as to leave no doubt of the existence of a fracture,\r\nthe only alternative is to destroy the animal, for of recovery there can be\r\nno hope. If, on the other hand, the paralysis is incomplete and there is no\r\ndepression or irregularity of the spinal column or other evidence of\r\nfracture, the patient should be made as comfortable as possible by being\r\nplaced in a well-bedded box stall and a few days permitted to elapse before\r\nthe case is abandoned. The symptoms last described may possibly be the\r\nresult of a severe strain of the muscles of the loins, in which case an\r\nimprovement will soon be noticeable.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF THE PELVIS.--The pelvis, or bony framework which gives shape\r\nto the posterior part of the body, is liable to fracture in many ways. A\r\ncommon one is by a separation of the two bones which constitute the whole\r\npelvis along the bottom and center line (symphysis pubis). In early life\r\nthe two bones are separate and distinct. The union between them, which is\r\nat first cartilaginous, undergoes a change and is converted into bone, so\r\nthat in adult life the whole pelvis is practically one bone. The point on\r\nwhich the two bones are united is weaker than the adjoining parts of the\r\nbone. When an animal slips violently, spreading the legs wide apart, the\r\nweaker materials give way and the bones are divided. If the accident is\r\nnoticed when it occurs, it is likely to throw light on the nature of the\r\ninjury. The animal will immediately go stiff behind, the legs being spread\r\napart. Further examination may be made by introducing the hand, previously\r\ncarefully oiled, into the rectum or vagina and pressing down along the\r\ncentral line, which will cause the patient to evince acute pain. In this\r\ncase no appliance can be used to advantage. The animal should be tied in a\r\nstall until the parts become reunited and the lameness disappears.\r\n\r\nFracture of the posterior parts of the bone (ischium), which forms the\r\npoint of the buttocks occasionally occurs. The buttock on the injured side\r\nwill be less prominent than the other. Careful manipulation will generally\r\nmove the parts so that crepitus may be recognized. If the fracture is\r\nthrough the posterior part of the bone, it is unimportant and deserving of\r\nno more attention than placing the animal in such position as to insure it\r\nagainst subsequent injury until the bones are united. Some distortion may\r\nresult, but not sufficient to warrant interference.\r\n\r\nFracture through the body of the bone on a line with the hip joint\r\n(acetabulum) occasionally, though rarely, occurs, and is nearly always\r\nassociated with dislocation of the hip joint and the forcing of the head of\r\nthe upper bone of the leg (femur) upward, far out of its place. The violent\r\ncontraction of the powerful muscles of the hip renders it impossible to\r\nreduce the dislocation, and even if it were possible the fractured pelvis\r\ncould not be held in position, so that the case becomes at once hopeless.\r\nIt may be recognized by the animal's standing on three legs, the leg on the\r\ninjured side seeming shorter than its fellow and hanging pendulous, the\r\nmuscles of the hip violently contracted and hard to the touch. The animal\r\nevinces great pain when the limb is moved. There is liable to be some\r\napparent distortion in the relations between the point of the hip and the\r\npoint of the buttock. This will be more readily noticed by comparing the\r\ninjured side with the other. The parts may be moved so as to produce\r\ncrepitus. The examination may be completed by introducing the oiled hand\r\ninto the vagina or rectum, when the two sides of the pelvis will reveal\r\nwell-marked differences.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE POINT OF THE HIP.--The anterior and external part of the\r\npelvis (ilium), commonly known as the point of the hip, is liable to\r\nfracture, which stock owners describe as \"hipping,\" or being \"hipped,\" or\r\nhaving the hip \"knocked down.\" This accident may be the result of crowding\r\nwhile passing through a narrow door, of falling violently on the point of\r\nthe hip, or from a violent blow directed downward and forward against it.\r\nThe lesion generally extends across the flat surface of the bone from its\r\nouter and posterior edge forward and inward. Distortion is liable to be the\r\nonly noticeable symptom. The detached portion varies in size in different\r\ncases and with it the resulting deformity. The animal is noticed to be\r\nslightly lame, but this symptom soon disappears. The detached portion of\r\nthe bone is drawn downward and away from the main part by the action of the\r\nmuscles below, which are so powerful as to render return impossible. The\r\nbones therefore remain permanently separated, union taking place by fibrous\r\ncallus. The animal suffers very little inconvenience, and for practical use\r\nmay be as serviceable as before the accident, though the distorted\r\nappearance depreciates its value.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE RIBS.--Such an occurrence can take place only as the result\r\nof a direct injury, as from blows or crowding. The posterior ribs, being\r\nmore exposed, are more liable to fracture. Pain in moving, slight swelling\r\nover the seat of injury, and difficult breathing are obvious symptoms. If\r\nthe fracture is complete, crepitation may be occasionally noticed by\r\nplacing the hand flat over the injured part, carefully observing the motion\r\nas the chest contracts and expands during respiration. This symptom is more\r\nnoticeable when the animal coughs. Unless the point of the broken bone\r\npenetrates the cavity of the chest the fracture is usually unimportant and\r\ncalls for no treatment other than quiet. If the breathing is very labored\r\nand attended with much pain, motion may be limited by applying a wide\r\nbandage firmly around the chest. The animal should be restricted in the\r\namount of feed and water for a few days, the stomach being kept as nearly\r\nempty as possible. Sloppy feed should be given to encourage, as much as\r\npossible, free action of the diaphragm in breathing.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF BONES OF THE LIMBS.--On this subject much has been said in the\r\npreceding remarks on general fractures. As a rule, fracture through one of\r\nthe large bones of the shoulder (scapula) or thigh (femur) is very\r\ndifficult to manage. The powerful contraction of the muscles and the\r\nchanging shape of the limb resulting from their action renders it\r\nimpossible to retain the detached parts of the bone in proper position.\r\nTherefore, though the union should take place, there is almost sure to be\r\nconsiderable deformity and more or less lameness. Fracture of the arm\r\n(humerus) or leg (tibia) is likely to be attended with better results. The\r\nmuscular covering is not so thick, the sheath in which they are held is\r\nmore tense, and the change in the shape of the limb from muscular action\r\nnot so noticeable, the muscular force not so great, all of which facilitate\r\nreplacing the dislodged ends and retaining them.\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE KNEE (CARPUS) AND HOCK (TARSUS).--This seldom occurs unless\r\nit is the result of a very violent injury, and is generally associated with\r\nother injury and serious complications. Displacement does not generally\r\noccur to any considerable extent. The treatment, of course, consists in\r\nholding the limb perfectly quiet in a natural position, which may be done\r\nby the application of long, wooden splints retained by bandages, or a\r\nplaster-of-Paris bandage.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES BELOW THE KNEE.--Fracture of the long bone below the knee\r\n(metacarpus) and hock (metatarsus) is more common. In young animals of\r\nquiet temperament the treatment of simple fractures here is likely to be\r\nattended with good results. On the other hand, a compound fracture in this\r\nregion becomes a serious matter. The structures which surround the bones\r\nare so thin that a very small degree of sloughing will expose parts of the\r\nbones and be liable to lead to serious complications and probably fatal\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nFRACTURES OF BONES BELOW THE FETLOCK.--These fractures are comparatively\r\nunimportant unless associated with other serious injury. The parts can\r\ngenerally be held in position without much difficulty, and union generally\r\ntakes place quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nAPPLIANCES.--Of the appliances used in the treatment of the fracture of\r\nlimbs above the knee, splints made of wood or iron strips and bandages are\r\nlikely to serve best. Below the knee plaster-of-Paris bandages are\r\npreferable. The writer is well aware that many of the standard authors\r\ndeprecate the use of the latter, but an extensive experience leads me to\r\nbelieve that they have many advantages over any of the other appliances\r\nwhen used alone, and in many ways they may be used with advantage in\r\ncombination with others.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISLOCATIONS.\r\n\r\nLuxation, or displacement without fracture of the bones forming a joint, is\r\ncomparatively rare among cattle. It most frequently occurs in the stifle\r\njoint, where dislocation of the kneepan (patella) takes place. A glance at\r\nthe skeleton (Pl. XXV) will show the relations better than they can be\r\ndescribed. It will be observed that the small, irregularly shaped bone\r\n(patella) plays on the anterior rounded part of the lower edge of the thigh\r\nbone (femur) and between it and the upper end of the shank bone (tibia).\r\nThe outer ridge on the lower end of the thigh bone is less prominent than\r\nthe inner one, so that displacement, when it does take place, is by\r\nslipping outward. Such an accident may occur from direct injury or external\r\nforce, as a blow, or from slipping. When it does occur the symptoms\r\nproduced are somewhat alarming. The animal is unable to draw the leg\r\nforward, and either stands with it thrown back with the toe pointing\r\ndownward, or, if it should succeed in getting its weight upon it, holds it\r\nfirmly on the ground, fearing to move it. Examination of the outside of the\r\njoint will disclose the situation of the patella outside its proper place.\r\nIf the operator is not familiar with the normal appearance of the joint, it\r\nis well to make a comparison between the injured and the sound one. If\r\ncompelled to move, the animal does so with great difficulty, jerking the\r\nleg which it is unable to bring forward, hopping with the other, and\r\npartially dragging the injured one.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XXV. SKELETON OF THE COW.]\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment is simple. A rope 20 feet long should be\r\napplied around the fetlock of the affected leg, passed forward between the\r\nfront legs and up over the opposite side of the neck, back over the\r\nwithers, and wrapped once behind the elbow around that portion of the rope\r\nwhich passes between the front legs. The leg is then drawn away from the\r\nbody and forcibly pushed forward by an assistant, while another person\r\ntightens up the slack in the rope until the affected leg is off the ground\r\nin front of the supporting leg. The rope is then drawn taut and the\r\nassistant grasps the tail and pulls the cow toward the affected side. The\r\nanimal makes a lurch to keep from falling, contracts the muscles, and the\r\npatella slips into place with a sharp click, and the animal walks off as if\r\nnothing had happened. If the animal resists this method of handling, it may\r\nsuffice to manipulate the dislocated kneepan by shoving it inward and\r\nforward with the heel of the hand while the affected leg is drawn well\r\nforward. Unless some precaution is taken the accident is liable to recur,\r\nas the ligaments have been stretched by the dislocation till they no longer\r\nhold the bone with that firmness necessary to retain it. The animal should\r\nbe tied and the foot fastened forward, so that the patient can just stand\r\non it comfortably, by means of a rope or strap around the fetlock carried\r\nforward between the front legs, around the neck, and tied on the breast.\r\n\r\nShould this accident occur more than once it is a good practice to apply a\r\nblister around the joint, as in the formula recommended for sprain of\r\nshoulder, and observe the precautions as to restraint and subsequent\r\ntreatment there recommended. With this one exception dislocations in the ox\r\noccurring independently of other complications are rare.\r\n\r\nDislocation with fracture may occur in any of the joints, and if one is\r\nsuspected or discovered, examination should always be made for the other\r\nbefore treatment is applied. When a fracture occurs near a joint the force\r\nsufficient to rend the bone is liable to be partly exerted on the immediate\r\ntissues, and when the bone gives way the structures of the joints may be\r\nseriously injured. It occasionally happens that the injury to the joint\r\nbecomes the most important complication in the treatment of a fracture. In\r\norder clearly to understand the reason for this a few words are necessary\r\nin relation to the structure of joints.\r\n\r\nThe different pieces constituting the skeleton of the animal body are\r\nunited in such manner as to admit of more or less motion one upon another.\r\nIn some of the more simple joints the bones fitting one into another are\r\nheld together by the dense structures around them, admitting of very little\r\nor no movement at all, as the bones of the head. In other joints the bones\r\nare bound together by dense, cartilaginous structures, admitting of only\r\nlimited motion, such as the union of the small bones at the back part of\r\nthe knee and hock (metacarpal and metatarsal). In the more nearly perfect\r\nform of joint the power of motion becomes complete and the structures are\r\nmore complex. The substance of the bone on its articular surface is not\r\ncovered with periosteum, but is sheathed in a dense, thin layer of\r\ncartilage, shaped to fit the other surfaces with which it comes in contact\r\n(articular). This layer is thickest toward its center when covering bony\r\neminences, and is elastic, of a pearly whiteness, and resisting, though\r\nsoft enough to be easily cut. The bones forming an articulation are bound\r\ntogether by numerous ligaments attached to bony prominences. The whole\r\njoint is sealed in by a band or ribbonlike ligament (capsular ligament)\r\nextending around the joint and attached at the outer edge of the articular\r\nsurface, uniting the bones and hermetically sealing the cavities of the\r\narticulation. This structure and the articular surface of the bone is\r\ncovered by a thin, delicate membrane, known as the \"synovial membrane,\"\r\nwhich secretes the joint oil (synovia). This fluid is viscid and colorless,\r\nor slightly yellow, and although it does not possess a large quantity of\r\nfat, its character somewhat resembles oil, and it serves the same purpose\r\nin lubricating the joints that oil does to the friction surface of an\r\nengine. Although the tissues of the joint when used in a natural way are\r\nable to withstand the effect of great exertion, when unnaturally used, as\r\nthey are very delicate and complex, they are liable to inflammatory and\r\nother changes of a very serious nature. The synovial membrane, and in fact\r\nthe whole structure of the joint, is susceptible to injury and serious\r\ninflammatory derangement, and the capsular ligament is liable to be\r\ndistended from excessive secretion of synovia. The latter process may be\r\nalmost noninflammatory, and attended with little inconvenience or\r\nimportance other than a blemish to the animal, which in cattle is not\r\nserious. It may occur on the back part of the leg above the fetlock or on\r\nthe inner and fore part of the hock, corresponding in its location to\r\nwindgalls and bog spavin of the horse. Continuous support by bandages will\r\ngenerally force reabsorption, and as the limb is not subjected to violent\r\naction, as in the case of the horse, the affection is not so liable to\r\nrecur.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPAVIN.\r\n\r\nOccasionally working oxen that are used in the lumber woods and made to\r\npull heavily, with bad footing, are afflicted with this condition. When it\r\noccurs lameness is the first symptom. During the early stages of the\r\ndisease the lameness is most severe in the morning, and disappears after\r\nthe animal is exercised; it gradually becomes more severe as the disease\r\nadvances, so that when the disease is well established the animal is lame\r\ncontinuously. Shortly after the lameness appears a bunch (exostosis) will\r\nbe noticed on the inner and fore part of the affected joint. This bunch\r\ndiffers from bog spavin in that it is hard, while bog spavin is soft. It\r\nincreases in size as the disease advances till the animal is too lame to be\r\nused for labor. As the disease is always attended with considerable pain\r\nthere is more or less loss of flesh. In the most advanced stage the animal\r\nwill step with difficulty, frequently holding the foot from the ground, or,\r\nif forced to take a few steps, stands with it elevated, twitching with\r\npain. In the earlier stages of the disease only a small portion of the fore\r\npart of the lower, or second, articulation is involved, but the\r\ninflammatory process gradually extends over the whole surface of the lower\r\njoints of the hock. The structures of the joint are broken down and the\r\nbones are united (anchylosis). This process may include any or all of the\r\nthree lower joints of the hock. The joint of motion which is situated on\r\nthe lower end of the leg bone is seldom involved.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment of spavin in the ox, as in the horse, is likely to\r\nbe tedious, and not always resulting in perfect cure. Usually it is best to\r\nfatten the animal for slaughter. If, however, treatment is decided upon, it\r\nshould consist of complete rest and counterirritation of the part either\r\nby sharp blisters or the firing iron. It is advisable to try the effect of\r\nblistering first, and for this purpose the following mixture is\r\nrecommended:\r\n\r\n  Powdered cantharides            drams     2\r\n  Biniodid of mercury              do       2\r\n  Vaseline                        ounces    1-1/2\r\n\r\nClip the hair off and apply over the inner and fore part of the joint,\r\ncovering the surface an inch and a half in every direction from the\r\nenlargement, or over an area 3 to 4 inches across. Fasten the animal's head\r\nso that it can not reach the part to lick it; after the third day grease\r\nwith lard every other day until the scabs come off. This blister may be\r\nrepeated three or four times at intervals of three weeks. The lameness will\r\ngenerally begin to disappear about the third or fourth month if the\r\nabove-described treatment proves beneficial. Should lameness persist,\r\nfiring in points by a qualified veterinarian may effect the desired result\r\nand should be tried as a last resort.\r\n\r\nIn a case of spavin the cure is not effected by restoring the diseased\r\nparts to their natural condition, but by uniting the bones and obliterating\r\nthe joints. If this union extends over the whole articular surface of the\r\njoints affected and is sufficiently strong to prevent any motion of the\r\nbones, the animal will again go sound. The joints that are obliterated, not\r\nbeing those of motion, are not important, so that the animal suffers no\r\ninconvenience in their loss.\r\n\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.\r\n\r\nRheumatism is a constitutional disease from a specific condition of the\r\nblood and characterized by inflammation of the fibrous structures of the\r\nbody. It is usually accompanied with stiffness, lameness, and fever. The\r\nparts affected are usually swollen, but swelling may be lacking. The\r\ninflammation may be transitory; that is, it changes from place to place.\r\nThe parts usually affected are the fibrous structures of the joints,\r\ntendons, ligaments, and muscles. The serous membranes and heart may also be\r\naffected. According to its location, rheumatism is specified as articular\r\nor muscular. According to its course, it is designated as acute or chronic.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--Among the factors which are actively causative of rheumatism may\r\nbe mentioned exposure to dampness and cold, especially while the animal is\r\nperspiring or fatigued after severe physical exertion. Among other causes\r\noften mentioned are acidity of the blood, nervous derangement, microbes,\r\nand injuries. It occasionally follows another disease, such as pleurisy.\r\nThe influence of age and heredity may be considered as secondary or\r\npredisposing causes. Sometimes the disease appears without any apparent\r\ncause. On the whole, it may be said that any of the above-mentioned factors\r\nmay have more or less influence on the production of rheumatism, but the\r\nspecific cause is as yet unknown.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of articular rheumatism._--The symptoms appear suddenly and with\r\nvarying degrees of severity. The animal presents a downcast appearance,\r\nwith staring coat, horns and ears cold, and the mouth and muzzle hot and\r\ndry. Appetite and rumination may be impaired and followed later or be\r\naccompanied at the same time by constipation. Constipation may be followed\r\nby impaction of the stomach or bowels. Thirst is increased, but the amount\r\nof urine voided is scanty. Respiration and pulse are accelerated, and there\r\nis usually a fever, rising sometimes as high as 108∞ F. The animal prefers\r\nto lie down, and when forced to rise stands with its back arched. The\r\nmovements are stiff and lame and cause great pain. The disease may attack\r\none or more joints at the same time; in fact, it is often symmetrical. One\r\njoint may improve while another becomes affected, thus showing the shifting\r\ntendency of the inflammation. The affected joints, including their tendons,\r\nligaments, and synovial membranes, may be swollen, hot, and distended with\r\nliquid. They are very tender, and, if treated carelessly or injured, may\r\nbecome infected, thus leading to suppuration. While rheumatism attacks\r\nperhaps more frequently the knees and fetlocks, it has no special affinity\r\nfor any joint and may attack the stifle, hip, shoulder, or elbow joint. In\r\nmild cases of articular rheumatism, the animal may fully recover in a few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nIn chronic articular rheumatism there is less tendency of the disease to\r\nshift about, but there is a greater liability of structural change in the\r\naffected joints. This change may consist of induration, exostosis, or even\r\nanchylosis. These structural changes about the joints may lead to permanent\r\ndeformity, such as the bending of the neck. Fever is not so constant in the\r\nchronic form as in the acute, and the latter may lapse into the former.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of muscular rheumatism._--This form of rheumatism may appear\r\nunder the same general conditions as the articular form. The general\r\nappearance of the animal is the same in both forms. The cow usually assumes\r\na recumbent position, and all the movements made are stiff and lame. The\r\nmethod of rising or of locomotion indicates pain in certain muscles or\r\ngroups of muscles, as of the croup, shoulder, or neck. As in the case of\r\narticular rheumatism, the tendons, ligaments, and synovial membranes may\r\nbecome involved. The constitutional symptoms in both articular and muscular\r\nrheumatism are similar, so that it is often perplexing to differentiate\r\nbetween the two forms.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--It is somewhat difficult to procure preventive treatment for\r\ncattle, especially when there are large numbers with little or no shelter.\r\nIn general, it is advisable to protect the animals so far as possible from\r\ninclement weather conditions, such as cold rains, heavy dews, and frosts.\r\nThis is more particularly necessary for animals in poor condition, or those\r\nwhich are perspiring or fatigued after long physical exertion. Careful\r\nfeeding is also essential.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In attempting to treat cattle for rheumatism the first step\r\nis to procure proper shelter and environment. The animal should be\r\nquartered in a large, clean, dry stall, with plenty of light and fresh air,\r\nbut protected from strong drafts. There should be an abundance of clean,\r\ndry bedding. The feed should be soft, easily digestible, and slightly\r\nlaxative, and the animal should have access to clean, pure, cool water.\r\n\r\nFor general or constitutional treatment of acute rheumatism, sodium\r\nsalicylate is indicated. In order to gain the best results from this drug,\r\nit should be administered with the idea of rapidly saturating the system.\r\nTo cattle it may be given in doses of one-half ounce every two hours for\r\nten hours or until immediate relief is obtained. This drug should not be\r\ncontinued indefinitely, but may be given once a day after immediate relief\r\nhas been obtained, and this single dose continued daily until permanent\r\nrelief ensues, when it should be stopped. The use of sodium salicylate in\r\nchronic rheumatism is not advisable on account of the danger of depressing\r\nthe heart, whose action is already somewhat impaired by the lesions which\r\nhave attacked it. In this case one-half ounce doses of potassium nitrate or\r\nbicarbonate may be given three times a day. Besides the constitutional\r\ntreatment, it may be necessary to give special attention to the bowels in\r\norder to relieve constipation. Cattle may be given saline laxatives at the\r\noutset, such as 1 pound of Epsom salt for an ordinary-sized cow, and the\r\nbowels kept regular by an occasional smaller dose.\r\n\r\nIn chronic rheumatism the best course of treatment is to give tonics and\r\nlocal treatment. Local treatment may also be advisable in acute rheumatism\r\nin addition to the constitutional treatment already prescribed.\r\n\r\nExternal treatment depends solely on the local conditions and should be\r\napplied judiciously. Among the various remedies may be mentioned hot or\r\ncold moist packs, hot air and vapor baths, friction, etc. Anodynes are\r\noften applied locally with good results. Blisters are occasionally\r\nindicated. As anodynes may be mentioned liniments and ointments containing\r\nsalicylic acid or sodium salicylate in combination with laudanum, aconite,\r\nor chloral hydrate. Camphorated spirit, soap liniment, and essential oils\r\nalso afford some relief when applied locally. Of blisters, those containing\r\ncantharides are most effective.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] A Priessnitz bandage is a dressing which combines the three properties\r\nof keeping a part warm, moist, and subjecting it to uniform pressure. It\r\nconsists of three layers of material. The inner layer is composed of\r\nabsorbent cotton or some other material which is capable of holding\r\nmoisture. This is soaked in water and wrapped around the part. The second\r\nlayer consists of a substance which is impervious to moisture, as oiled\r\nsilk or oiled paper, and is applied about the inner layer to prevent\r\nevaporation. The third or outside layer is composed of a flannel or woolen\r\nbandage to prevent the radiation of heat and thus keep the moist inner\r\nlayer at the temperature of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSURGICAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nBy WILLIAM DICKSON and WILLIAM HERBERT LOWE, D. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by B. T. Woodward, V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSurgery is both a science and an art. The success of surgical operations\r\ndepends on the judgment, skill, and dexterity, as well as upon the\r\nknowledge of the operator. The same fundamental principles underlie and\r\ngovern animal and human surgery, although their applications have a wide\r\nrange and are very different in many essential particulars. We must not\r\nlose sight of the fact that hygiene and sanitation are essential to the\r\nbest results in veterinary as well as in human surgery.\r\n\r\nAsepsis is an ideal condition which, although not always possible in animal\r\nsurgery, is highly important in connection with the mechanical details of\r\nall surgical operations in proportion to the nature and seriousness of the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nAseptic surgery is considered to be the performance of operations with\r\nsterile instruments with the hands of the operator and the site of\r\noperation being rendered as nearly sterile as possible, and the wound\r\ntreated during operation with sterile solutions and protected following the\r\noperation with sterile bandage material. In other words, it is the\r\npreservation of the highest degree of cleanliness in connection with\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nLocal or general anesthesia should be resorted to in painful and serious\r\nsurgical operations, as operations upon all living creatures should be\r\nhumanely performed and all unnecessary pain and suffering avoided.\r\nAnesthesia is necessary where absolute immobility of the patient is\r\nessential and where entire muscular relaxation is indispensable. The\r\nanesthetic condition is also favorable for the adjustment of displaced\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nLarge animals have to be cast and secured before an anesthetic is\r\nadministered. For complete anesthesia inhalations of chloroform are\r\ngenerally employed; sometimes of both ether and chloroform. The quantity of\r\nchloroform required to produce insensibility to external impressions varies\r\nmuch in different cases and must be regulated, as well as the admixture of\r\nair, by a competent assistant.\r\n\r\nIf the probability of the success of an operation is remote and the animal\r\nis in healthy physical condition, so that its flesh is good for human food,\r\nit is more advisable to butcher the animal than to attempt a surgical\r\noperation that offers little encouragement to the owner. The best judgment\r\nhas to be exercised in determining a matter of this kind, for no animal\r\nsuffering from inflammation or that is in a feverish condition is fit for\r\nhuman food.\r\n\r\nAll cases of major operative surgery require the skill and dexterity of the\r\nexperienced veterinary surgeon, and no one else should attempt such an\r\noperation, for unnecessary suffering must be prevented. Nevertheless, the\r\nmore knowledge and understanding an owner of animals has of the principles\r\nof surgical operations and manipulations, the better for all concerned. In\r\nthe first place, such an owner will appreciate more fully the skill of the\r\nqualified veterinarian, and, in the second place, he will be the better\r\nprepared and equipped to render assistance to his suffering dumb dependents\r\nwhere no practitioner is accessible and in cases of emergency. There are,\r\nmoreover, some minor operations upon cattle, some of which can hardly be\r\nclassed as surgical, that the stockman and farmer should be able to perform\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of any operation upon an animal of the size and strength\r\nof the bull or cow, the first consideration is to secure the animal in such\r\na manner as to preclude the possibility of its injuring either itself or\r\nthose taking any part in the operation. The nature and time likely to be\r\noccupied by an operation must, of course, largely determine the method to\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nThe majority of operations with which the present chapter is concerned are\r\nusually performed on the animal in a standing position. A bull should\r\nalways be held by a staff attached to the ring in his nose. To secure the\r\ncow in a standing position, grasp the nose, the finger and thumb being\r\nintroduced into the nostrils, and press against the cartilage which makes a\r\ndivision between them. If she has horns, grasp one of them with the\r\ndisengaged hand. If this is insufficient the animal should be secured to a\r\npost, along the side of a fence, or put into a stanchion. An excellent\r\nmethod of restraint is to tie a long rope in a slip noose over the horns,\r\npass it around the chest just behind the forelegs, taking a half hitch on\r\nitself, taking another half hitch in front of the hind limbs, passing the\r\nfree end under the tail, bringing it forward and making it fast either to\r\nthe head or one of the hitches. The head should be raised to the level of\r\nthe back before the final knot is tied, so as to render it too serious and\r\npainful a matter for her to repeat the first attempt she makes to lower it.\r\nShould the nature or extent of the operation be likely to take up\r\nconsiderable time, it is invariably the best plan to throw the animal. In\r\nthe case of the ox this is very easily done, either by use of horse\r\nhobbles, should they be at hand, or by the application of a simple rope. If\r\nthe horse hobbles are used, they should be fastened on the leg just above\r\nthe fetlocks (ankle joints), as in that position they are less liable to\r\ncome off than if placed around the pastern.\r\n\r\nOf the many ways of applying the rope for this purpose we will describe\r\nonly two, which we consider the best and simplest:\r\n\r\nFirst. Take a long, strong rope (one which has been used a few times is\r\nmore flexible), double it, and at 2 or 3 feet from the doubled end,\r\naccording to the size of the animal, make a knot and pass the collar thus\r\nformed over the animal's head, allowing it to rest on what would be the\r\ncollar place in a horse. Now, pass the ends of the rope between the\r\nforelegs, carry one around each hind leg just above the fetlock joint, from\r\noutside in, under itself once, and bring the free ends forward, passing\r\neach through the collar loop on its own side and bringing the slack back\r\ntoward and beyond the hind quarters. (Pl. XXVI, fig. 2.) Two or three men\r\nshould then take hold of each rope and at a given signal pull. The animal's\r\nhind legs being drawn forward, the balance is lost, and if the animal does\r\nnot fall or lie down he can be readily pushed over on his side and secured\r\nin the desired position.\r\n\r\nSecond. The three half hitches. Take a rope 30 or more feet long, make a\r\nslip noose at the end and pass it over the animal's horns, leaving the knot\r\nin the loop between the horns; then pass the rope backward along the neck\r\nto the withers, just in front of which take a half hitch on it, passing it\r\nalong the back, take one half hitch just behind the forelegs and a second\r\nin front of the hind limbs round the flank. (Pl. XXVI, fig. 1.) The free\r\nend of the rope is taken hold of by one or two assistants while another\r\nholds the animal's head. By pulling firmly on the rope, or inducing the\r\nanimal to make a step or two forward while steady traction is made on the\r\nrope, the beast will lie down, when his feet can be secured in the way most\r\nconvenient for the operator.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other methods, involving more or less complete\r\nrestraint, which may be equally efficacious, but one or other of the ways\r\nindicated will doubtless be found to meet fully all ordinary cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINGING THE BULL.\r\n\r\nThis is usually and ought always to be done before the calf has attained\r\nsufficient weight or strength to make his restraint a matter of serious\r\ndifficulty. An ordinary halter is usually all that is required, the strap\r\nbeing secured to a tree or post. A jointed steel or copper ring is\r\nordinarily used. Those made of the latter metal are preferable.\r\n\r\nThe common method of punching a round piece out of the nasal septum for the\r\nintroduction of the ring is, I think, open to objection, as portions of the\r\nfine nervous filaments are destroyed. The sensibility of the parts is thus\r\nlessened and the object of ringing to some extent defeated. The insertion\r\nof the ring by means of a trocar and cannula is preferable, as the method\r\nis not open to this objection.\r\n\r\nFor some years we have used a little instrument, which can be made by any\r\nworker in metal, consisting of a steel point riveted into a short cannula\r\nmade to fit on one end of the ring while open. (Pl. XXVII, fig. 11.) When\r\nattached to the ring it is easily and quickly passed through the septum,\r\nthe half of the ring following as a matter of course. It can then be\r\nremoved and the ends of the ring brought together and fastened by means of\r\nthe screw for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEHORNING.\r\n\r\nIn the wild state the utility of the horns of cattle as weapons of offense\r\nand defense is apparent, but with domestication of cattle and their\r\nconfinement the presence of horns constitutes a menace to the safety of\r\ntheir companions. Horned cattle frequently inflict with their horns painful\r\nand serious injuries to others. Deaths as a result of such injuries are not\r\nunusual. The operation of dehorning would therefore be indicated as a\r\nmatter of general safety.\r\n\r\nOn farms where breeding is conducted, the most desirable method is to\r\nprevent the horns from growing on the young calves. This action results in\r\na more symmetrical appearance of the poll and eliminates the dangers which\r\nwould result from the presence of horns on the young cattle prior to their\r\noperative removal at a later age. A calf should be treated not later than\r\none week after it is born--preferably when it is from 3 to 5 days old. The\r\nagent to be used may be either caustic soda or potash in the form of sticks\r\nabout the thickness of an ordinary lead pencil. These caustics must be\r\nhandled with care, as they dissolve the cuticle and may make the hands or\r\nfingers sore. The preparation of the calf first consists in clipping the\r\nhair from the parts, washing clean with soap or warm water, and thoroughly\r\ndrying with a cloth or towel. The stick of caustic should be wrapped in a\r\npiece of paper to protect the hands and fingers, leaving one end of the\r\nstick uncovered. Moisten the uncovered end slightly and rub it on the horn\r\nbuttons or little points which may be felt on the calf's head--first on\r\none, then on the other--two or three times, allowing the caustic to dry\r\nafter each application. Be careful to apply the caustic to the horn button\r\nonly, for if it is brought in contact with the surrounding skin it will\r\ncause pain. Too much moisture on the stick of caustic will allow the\r\napplication to spread to the surrounding skin. After treatment keep the\r\ncalf protected from rain, as water on the head after application of the\r\ncaustic will cause it to run down over the face.\r\n\r\nDehorning of adult animals is usually performed after the age of 2 years,\r\nas after that age there is less probability of the horns again growing. The\r\nhorns should be severed from the head from a quarter to a half-inch below\r\nwhere the skin joins the base of the horn, cutting from the back toward the\r\nfront if a saw is used. If the horn is not cut close enough to the head, an\r\nirregular, gnarly growth of horn is liable to follow.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to dehorn the animal, it should be securely controlled by\r\nropes in a stanchion or by casting. Upon the range the cattle are usually\r\ncontrolled by casting or by placing them in a \"squeezer\" connected with a\r\ncorral. A clean, sharp meat saw or a miter saw with a rigid back may be\r\nused. Various types of dehorning shears or clippers are in general use. One\r\ntype of dehorner has a stationary knife edge with its cutting edge shaped\r\nlike a very wide V, and opposing this, another knife of similar shape\r\nmoving in a slide, so that the cutting edges act upon the horn from all\r\nfour sides at once, all the edges passing the center at the same time.\r\nAnother type has a movable knife, with one oblique or one curved edge, and\r\nthe cutting is done in one direction only. The power for cutting with these\r\ninstruments is supplied by pulling together two long handles which, in\r\norder to transmit a greater force, are generally so constructed that they\r\nact through the medium of a series of cogs. In dehorning with these\r\ninstruments the cutting edges should be slipped down over the horn and the\r\nknives closed, so that their edges set firmly against the horn in such\r\nposition that the cut will be made in the right place and in the right\r\ndirection. The handles should then be drawn together with a quick, firm,\r\nstrong pull so that the horn will be completely severed by the first act\r\nand without twisting.\r\n\r\nDehorning should, when possible, be performed in cool weather when the\r\nflies are not plentiful. The loss of blood from the operation is not\r\nsufficient, as a rule, to be of consequence, and after care being taken to\r\nprevent substances from getting into the openings left after the removal of\r\nthe horns it is not usual to apply any dressing. Pine tar or a mixture of\r\npine tar and tannic acid may be applied, particularly if the weather is\r\nwarm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSETONING.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary use of a seton is to keep up constant drainage from a cavity\r\ncontaining matter or to act as a stimulant or counterirritant. To insert a\r\nseton, the place of entrance and exit having been decided on, with the\r\nfinger and thumb make a small fold of the skin transversely to the\r\ndirection the seton is to be inserted, and cut it through, either with a\r\nsharp knife or a pair of scissors (this should be done at both the entrance\r\nand exit); then with a steady pressure and slight lateral movement insert\r\nthe seton by means of a seton needle. (Pl. XXVII, figs. 1 and 2.) The seton\r\nshould consist of a piece of strong tape, varying in breadth according to\r\ncircumstances, and should be kept in place either by a knot on each end or\r\nby tying the ends together.\r\n\r\nSetons should be gently moved once a day after suppuration is set up, and\r\nthey should not be allowed to remain in over three weeks, or a month at the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACHEOTOMY.\r\n\r\nThis operation consists in making an opening in the trachea, or windpipe.\r\nIt is indicated whenever there is an obstruction from any cause in the\r\nupper part of the respiratory tract which threatens the death of the animal\r\nby asphyxia (suffocation). The mode of procedure is as follows: Have an\r\nassistant extend the animal's head as far as possible to make the trachea\r\ntense and prominent; make a longitudinal incision about 2 to 2-1/2 inches\r\nlong through the skin and deeper tissues and trachea at the most prominent\r\npart of the trachea, which is about the middle or upper third, and then\r\ninsert the tracheotomy tube. The latter should be removed once or twice\r\ndaily and cleansed, and the wound dressed antiseptically. To ascertain when\r\nit is time to discontinue the use of the tube and to allow the wound to\r\nclose, the hand should be held over the opening, which will require the\r\nanimal to use its natural passages in breathing. Observe whether it is\r\nperformed in a natural manner, and if so, remove the tube and allow the\r\nwound to close. Often the operation has to be performed in great haste\r\nwithout the proper instruments and under great disadvantages, the operator\r\nhaving to cut down quickly, open the trachea and spread the parts, using\r\nsome instrument improvised by him at the time. This operation only gives\r\nthe animal relief in breathing, and therefore the proper remedial treatment\r\nshould be adopted at the onset of the attack and continued until the cause\r\n(the disease) has been overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nRUMENOTOMY.\r\n\r\nThe opening of the paunch, or rumen, in cattle and the removal of a part or\r\nthe whole of the ingesta through said opening is termed rumenotomy. The\r\noperation should be performed in severe cases only, where the rumen is\r\nexcessively overloaded and distended. The animal is placed with its right\r\nside against a wall and firmly held in position by strong assistants. The\r\nincision is made in the same place that the trocar is inserted for\r\npuncturing that organ in cases of hoven. The opening is increased in size\r\nuntil the operator's hand can be inserted into the rumen. Before any of the\r\ncontents are removed from that organ a linen cloth should be placed from\r\nthe outer wound into the rumen in order to prevent any of the ingesta from\r\ngetting into the abdominal cavity. Some practitioners, after removing a\r\nportion of the contents of the rumen, introduce such medicine as may be\r\nindicated before closing the wound. Clean the wound and close the opening\r\nin the rumen with uninterrupted (Pl. XXVII, fig. 8) carbolized catgut\r\nsutures. Next close the external wound, consisting of the integument,\r\nmuscle, and peritoneum, with stout, interrupted (Pl. XXVII, fig. 6)\r\nmetallic sutures. No feed should be given for several hours after the\r\noperation, and then gruels only. (See \"Distention of rumen or paunch with\r\nfeed,\" p. 26.)\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ABSCESSES.\r\n\r\nAn abscess may be detected, if situated externally, by heat, pain, redness,\r\nand swelling in the early stages, and, if further developed, by the\r\nfluctuation which is present. When any of these symptoms are absent, the\r\nsuppuration should be encouraged by the means of hot fomentations and\r\npoultices. Care must be taken that the abscess is not opened too soon, or\r\nto some extent it may cause it to scatter, and the escape of pus will be\r\nlessened. The time to open an abscess is just before it is ready to break,\r\nand should be done with a sharp lance, a crucial incision sometimes being\r\nnecessary. The cavity should be syringed out with an antiseptic solution.\r\nCare should be taken not to allow the wound to close too rapidly, to\r\nprevent which a tent of lint or oakum should be introduced.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of the present work wounds may be divided into three\r\nclasses: (1) Incised; (2) punctured; (3) lacerated or contused. In any\r\nwound all that the most suitable applications can accomplish is, in the\r\nfirst place, to prevent the access of those poisonous germs which exist in\r\nthe animal's surroundings, such as the soil and the manure, and, in the\r\nsecond place, when the process of repair is for some reason temporarily\r\ninactive or altogether arrested, to incite that curative inflammation that\r\nis the invariable method by which the cure is effected.\r\n\r\nINCISED WOUND.--This is one with clean-cut edges, and may be either\r\nsuperficial or deep. In wounds of all descriptions there is necessarily\r\nmore or less bleeding, and this is especially liable to be the case in\r\nincised wounds, particularly when they penetrate to a considerable depth,\r\nor when inflicted on a part where blood vessels of any considerable size\r\napproach the surface. To arrest the hemorrhage must therefore be the first\r\nconsideration. If slight, a generous use of cold water is all that is\r\nnecessary, but if one or more vessels of any size have been wounded or\r\nentirely severed, they should be taken up and ligated. If the blood flows\r\ncontinuously and is dark in color, it proceeds from a vein, but if\r\nbright-colored and jerky in its flow, it is arterial.\r\n\r\nThe taking up of an artery simply means the tying up of the bleeding\r\nvessel, which should be accomplished as follows: To discover the bleeding\r\nartery take a piece of clean absorbent cotton, dip it in cold water, and by\r\ngentle pressure on the wound clear it of the accumulated blood. The jet of\r\nfresh blood reveals the end of the vessel, which is readily recognized by\r\nits whitish-yellow or buff color. It should be seized with a forceps or\r\npincers and slightly drawn clear of the surrounding tissues. Now take the\r\nthread and place the middle of it under the artery, take up the ends, tie\r\none simple knot tightly, pressing the thread down with the forefinger so as\r\nnot to include the forceps, then a second one over it and cut off the ends.\r\nThe bleeding being arrested, the operator can now carefully clean and\r\ninspect the wound, taking care to remove all blood and foreign matters and\r\nclip the hair around the edges before proceeding to stitch it up. If the\r\nwound is superficial, the lips may be brought together by a series of\r\nindependent stitches (Pl. XXVII, fig. 6) about one-half of an inch to\r\nthree-fourths of an inch apart. The stitches should not be drawn tightly;\r\nit is sufficient to bring the edges of the wound in apposition.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is deep, the needle should be introduced perpendicularly at as\r\ngreat a distance from the lip of the wound as the depth it is to be\r\ninserted, so as to give the thread sufficient hold. All the stitches should\r\nbe as nearly as possible at equal distances from the border of the wound,\r\nto prevent unequal strain, and the knots should be made at the side, not\r\nover the wound. (Pl. XXVII, fig. 6.) When the wound is large and deep, care\r\nshould be taken to have an opening in the lowest part to allow for the\r\nescape of the discharges.\r\n\r\nIn deep wounds which run crosswise of a limb or muscle it is often\r\nadvisable to use what is technically known as the \"quilled suture,\" which\r\nis most readily understood by reference to Plate XXVII, figure 7. To\r\naccomplish this method a curved needle with an eye in the point and a\r\nstrong double thread should be used. The needle thus threaded is introduced\r\nperpendicularly at least an inch from the wound on one side, carried across\r\nbelow and brought out the same distance from the border of the cut on the\r\nopposite side, the thread being seized and held in position while the\r\nneedle is withdrawn, leaving a loop of thread protruding on one side and\r\ntwo loose ends on the other side of each stitch. When enough stitches have\r\nbeen made, take a light piece of wood about the size of a lead pencil,\r\ncorresponding in length to the size of the wound or slightly longer, and\r\ninsert it through each of the loops, drawing up the free ends of the\r\nthreads, which should in turn be tied securely on a similar piece of wood\r\non that side.\r\n\r\nPUNCTURED WOUNDS.--Owing to the uncertainty of their depth and the\r\nstructures they may involve, punctured wounds are by far the most dangerous\r\nand difficult to treat. Not only is the extent of the damage hidden from\r\nview, but the very character of the injury, as can be readily understood,\r\nimplies at least the possibility of deep-seated inflammation and\r\nconsequent discharge of pus (matter), which, when formed, is kept pent up\r\nuntil it has accumulated to such an extent that it burrows by simple\r\ngravity, as no other exit is possible. In this way foreign matters, such as\r\na broken piece of the stake or snag, or whatever caused the wound, may be\r\ncarried to an indefinite depth, or the cavity of a joint may be invaded and\r\nvery serious, if not fatal, consequences occur.\r\n\r\nThe danger is especially marked when the injury is inflicted on parts\r\nliable to frequent and extensive motion, but all cases of punctured wounds\r\nshould receive unusual care, as no judgment can be accurately formed from\r\nthe external appearance of the wound. While a probe can ascertain the\r\ndepth, it throws but little light on the extent or exact nature of the\r\ninternal injury. For this reason all punctured wounds should invariably be\r\ncarefully searched by means of a probe or some substitute devised for the\r\noccasion, such as a piece of wire with a smooth blunt end, or a piece of\r\nhard wood shaped for the purpose. Stitching is not admissible in the case\r\nof punctured wounds. After thoroughly cleansing the opening of the wound\r\nand its surroundings, tincture of iodin should be injected directly into\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nIf a punctured wound is not very deep, and when the bruising and laceration\r\nare slight, it is possible for healing to take place by adhesion, and this\r\nshould always be encouraged, as the process of repair by this method is far\r\nsuperior to that by granulation, which will be referred to later. With this\r\nobject in view, the animal should be kept as quiet as possible. A dose of\r\nphysic, such as a pound of Glauber's or Epsom salt, should be administered,\r\nand warm antiseptic fomentations or poultices, when this is practicable,\r\napplied frequently to the surface of the wound.\r\n\r\nIn wounds of this description the process of repair may be complicated by\r\nthe appearance of exuberant granulations, popularly known as \"proud flesh,\"\r\nwhich is really an overgrowth of new tissue--granulation tissue; but these\r\nshould not be interfered with unless they continue after the acute stage of\r\ninflammation has been subdued. If, after this, they persist, they may be\r\ntreated with a 10 per cent solution of sulphate of copper (bluestone) or\r\nnitrate of silver (lunar caustic) in water.\r\n\r\nCONTUSED OR LACERATED WOUNDS.--These are usually caused by a blow with some\r\nblunt instrument or by falls. The seriousness depends largely on the depth\r\nof the injury, and treatment should be directed to allaying the\r\ninflammation and preventing the consequent tendency to sloughing. To this\r\nend soothing applications, such as antiseptic fomentations and poultices,\r\nare plainly indicated.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF HEALING.--Technically these may be divided into a number of\r\ndistinct processes, but practically we may speak of them as two only,\r\nnamely, by primary union, or adhesion, and by granulation. As suppuration\r\nis not so liable to occur in cattle as in horses, healing by the former and\r\nmore speedy process is much more common in the first-named species, more\r\nparticularly in clean-cut or incised wounds, provided they have been\r\nstitched within 12 hours from the time the injury which caused them was\r\ninflicted, that they have been kept antiseptically clean, and that the\r\npatient by some means has been kept fairly still. This latter stipulation\r\nis probably hardest to comply with. Quiet is an important factor in the\r\nprocess of repair among the lower animals.\r\n\r\nThe second method of healing, namely, by granulation, which is, however,\r\nthe manner in which most wounds in animals heal, takes much longer. In\r\npunctured wounds of any depth healing necessarily takes place in this way\r\nonly, and the treatment should be directed largely to alleviating pain and\r\nmoderating inflammation.\r\n\r\nAFTER-TREATMENT AND DRESSING OF WOUNDS.--The dressing of wounds is one of\r\nthe most important branches of veterinary surgery, and one of the most\r\nconstant difficulties that the practicing veterinarian has to contend with\r\nlies in the lack of cooperation on the part of owners in the care and\r\nattention in the after-treatment of wounds.\r\n\r\nIn summarizing the treatment of wounds, the following recommendations\r\nshould be observed: wounds must be cleansed and kept clean, using\r\nantiseptic solutions which do not produce irritation, and applying the\r\nsolutions with a syringe or with clean pieces of absorbent cotton. Bleeding\r\nshould be stopped before the closing of the wound by sutures or bandages.\r\nAn opening at the bottom of all wounds except small superficial wounds\r\nshould be provided as a drainage outlet for the escape of wound secretions\r\nor pus if it should form. The edges of wounds and the muscles involved in\r\nthe wound should be kept as quiet as possible during the process of\r\nhealing. Every wound should be protected by a sterile or antiseptic\r\ndressing whenever it is possible to retain a dressing in place. Dressings\r\nshould be changed when it is apparent that they have become drenched with\r\nwound secretions or pus, or have become disarranged or too loose,\r\npermitting dirt to enter between them and the skin. If swelling appears\r\nbeyond the edges of a bandage, it is an indication that it is too tight and\r\nit should then be removed and again applied.\r\n\r\nThe hands of the operator and all instruments and dressings coming in\r\ncontact with a wound at any time should be made as clean as possible by the\r\nuse of antiseptics.\r\n\r\nBARBED-WIRE CUTS.--We have specified these simply because in some sections\r\nof the country there is a fixed idea that there is a specific poison in\r\nbarbed wire, causing injuries which require treatment differing from that\r\nwhich is applicable to ordinary wounds. Barbed-wire cuts differ from\r\nordinary wounds only in the parts being often lacerated and torn, and the\r\ntreatment already indicated for wounds of that description is applicable to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.\r\n\r\nCastration consists in the removal of the essential organs of generation,\r\nand is performed upon both the male and the female. In the male the organs\r\nremoved are the testicles and in the female the ovaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF THE MALE.\r\n\r\nCastration in the male is performed for several different purposes. It may\r\nbe necessary, as is the case in certain diseased conditions of the\r\ntesticles and in strangulated hernia, but the usual object of the operation\r\nis to enhance the general value of the animal. For example, if the animal\r\nis intended for burden, the operation will better fit him for his work by\r\nso modifying his temperament and physical condition that he may easily be\r\ncontrolled by his master. Again, if he is merely to be used for beef\r\npurposes, the operation will improve the quality of the flesh and cause an\r\nadded development of the most valuable portions of the dressed carcass.\r\n\r\nThe operation upon the female may be performed on account of diseased\r\nconditions, but we may say that the chief object of the operation is to\r\nmake the animal one of more profit to its owner by lessening the lacteal\r\nsecretion and also improving the physical condition from the point of view\r\nof beef production. When the cow is spayed, it does away with all trouble\r\nattending estrum, or heat, gestation, and parturition with its accidents\r\nand ailments. The flesh of the spayed cow is more tender and juicy than\r\nthat of the natural animal.\r\n\r\nThe operation upon the male may be either the uncovered or the covered. In\r\nthe former the incision is made down to the testicle proper, and in the\r\nlatter the cut is made through the scrotum or the outside covering and\r\nthrough the dartos, or the next coat, care being taken to cut no deeper\r\ntissues or coats. The age at which the operation is performed varies, but\r\nusually it is performed between the second and third month. If done in\r\nearly life, there is less danger of complications, the organs being in a\r\nlatent condition and not fully developed. There are many different methods\r\nof operating, the principal ones of which we shall mention.   In the\r\nuncovered operation a good free incision should be made, exposing the\r\ntesticle completely. Now it may be removed by simply cutting it off. The\r\nonly danger of doing this is that hemorrhage is liable to follow. To\r\nobviate this, before the division of the spermatic cord it should be\r\ntwisted several times in the following manner: Take hold of the cord with\r\nthe left hand, having it between the thumb and the index finger. Now twist\r\nthe free portion several times with the right hand, all the time being\r\ncareful to push with the left hand toward the body of the animal. In this\r\nway the danger of injury to the cord during the animal's struggles will be\r\novercome. There will be no hemorrhage, or very little, if it has been done\r\nproperly. This is the most simple manner of torsion. There are forceps and\r\nother instruments made to perform the operation in this manner. The actual\r\ncautery is an old method, but we shall not describe it, as we consider that\r\nwe have better methods now. The next method with the clamps, although\r\nextensively used upon the horse, is not practiced to so great an extent\r\nupon the bovine at the present time. It is a very old method, and is\r\nconsidered very safe. Clamps are used in the covered and uncovered\r\noperations.\r\n\r\nMore modern methods are by the use of special instruments known as the\r\nemasculator and the Ècraseur.\r\n\r\nThe operation of \"mulling\" or crushing the spermatic cord is an\r\nunscientific and barbarous procedure, causing unnecessary pain and\r\nsuffering.\r\n\r\nThe methods described above apply only to the animal in a normal condition.\r\nBefore operating everything should be examined to see that it is as it\r\nshould be. If otherwise, a special operative procedure will be necessary.\r\nWhichever mode of operation is adopted from a practical standpoint, the\r\nprincipal precautions to be taken in order to attain success are as\r\nfollows: First, thorough cleanliness under strict aseptic and antiseptic\r\nprecautions; second, a free and boldly made incision; third, the avoidance\r\nof undue pulling or tension upon the spermatic cord; fourth, free drainage,\r\nwhich can be maintained, provided the original incision has been properly\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nThe operation of castration of the male is by no means a serious one, and\r\nwhen properly performed there is little danger from complications. Although\r\nthe danger is trifling, the complications which may arise are sometimes of\r\na serious nature. Hemorrhage, either primary or secondary, tetanus (or\r\nlockjaw), abscesses, hernia (or rupture), gangrene, and peritonitis are the\r\nmost serious complications that follow castration. Whichever complication\r\narises will require its own special treatment, which we will not go into\r\nhere, as it will be fully dealt with under another heading. We would add,\r\nhowever, that, generally speaking, the animal, after being castrated,\r\nshould either be regularly exercised or be allowed freedom so that it can\r\nexercise itself. Sudden changes of the temperature are dangerous. The\r\nanimal should be fed moderately, but of a diet easily digestible.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF THE FEMALE.\r\n\r\nThe operation of ovariotomy (spaying) should be performed when the heifer\r\nis in her prime and in moderate condition not too plethoric and not in heat\r\nor pregnant. This operation may be performed in one of two ways--namely, by\r\nthe flank or by the vagina--each operation having its special advantages.\r\nIn the flank operation the animal may be operated upon either while\r\nstanding or while in the recumbent position. If standing, she should be\r\nplaced against a wall or a partition and her head held by a strong\r\nassistant. The legs also must be secured to prevent the animal from\r\nkicking. A vertical incision should be made in the left flank, about the\r\nmiddle of the upper portion, care being taken not to make the opening too\r\nfar down, in order to avoid the division of the circumflex artery which\r\ntraverses that region. The operator should now make an opening through the\r\nperitoneum, which is best done with the fingers. Next the hand and arm\r\nshould be introduced into the abdominal cavity and the hand directed\r\nbackward toward the pelvis, searching for the horns of the uterus; if\r\nfollowed up the ovaries will easily be found. They should then be drawn\r\noutward and may be removed either by the Ècraseur or by torsion. Closing\r\nand suturing the wound will complete the operation. An adhesive plaster\r\nbandage can be beneficially applied.\r\n\r\nThe operation by the vagina is more complicated and requires special and\r\nexpensive instruments. The mode of procedure in brief is as follows: A\r\nspeculum is introduced into the vagina, and an incision is made into the\r\nsuperior wall of that passage about 2 inches from the neck of the uterus,\r\ncutting from below upward and from before backward. An incision which\r\nshould not exceed 3-1/2 inches in length should be made. The next step is\r\nto get possession of the ovaries. They are situated in a fold of the broad\r\nligament and should be drawn carefully through the incision into the\r\nvagina. Now take the long-handled scissors, specially made for this\r\npurpose, with which the thick border of the broad ligament is divided. The\r\ntorsion forceps are introduced and applied to the broad ligament above the\r\novary. The left hand is then introduced, and the thumb and the index finger\r\ngrasp hold of the broad ligament above the forceps. With the right hand\r\ntorsion is applied and the ovary removed. The other ovary may be removed in\r\nthe same manner.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said with regard to complications and aftertreatment in the\r\ncase of the male also applies to the female.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SURGICAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of other surgical operations not given in this chapter may be\r\nfound in other parts of this work by reference to the index.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSURGICAL OPERATIONS.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPlate XXVI.

D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry._\r\n\r\n\r\n[_Synonyms:_ New growth, neoplasm, neoformation, pseudoplasm, swelling, and\r\nhyperplasia.]\r\n\r\n_Definition._--Tumors[3] are abnormal masses of tissue, noninflammatory and\r\nindependent in character, arising, without obvious cause, from cells of\r\npreexistent tissue, possessing no physiologic function, and\r\ncharacteristically unrestrained in growth and structure.\r\n\r\nTumors are abnormal masses of tissue. The application of the term \"tumor\"\r\nis directly connected with the fact that they produce local enlargement.\r\n\r\nThey are noninflammatory; that is, the process of inflammation is not\r\ndirectly the cause or accompaniment of them. An inflammatory new growth\r\ntends to disappear upon the subsidence of the inflammatory process, while\r\nspontaneous disappearance of a tumor is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nTumors are independent. For instance, their nutrition bears no relation to\r\nthe nutrition of the body. A lipoma, or fatty tumor, in the subcutaneous\r\ntissue, may go on increasing to huge bulk while the body is steadily\r\nemaciating. Again, the tissues of the aged gradually undergo atrophy, yet\r\ncancers arise at this time and grow rapidly.\r\n\r\nTumors are unrestrained in growth and structure. In the development of an\r\nanimal we know at what period of its existence the mass of tissue called\r\nliver will develop--what its site, structure, and size will be. We know\r\nthat it will remain only in that locality, and not, as it were, colonize\r\nthroughout the system. With tumors it is different; there are no laws by\r\nwhich we can forecast the time, place, nature, or size of development of\r\nthem. There is no cartilage in the kidney or parotid gland, yet a\r\nchondroma, or cartilage tumor, may develop in either.   Even when a new\r\ngrowth of tissue is started by an injury and consequent inflammation--as,\r\nfor instance, proud flesh--there is a limitation of its size, but the\r\ncontrolling influences which govern the size of an organ or normal mass of\r\ntissue and limit the extent of an inflammatory overgrowth are all absent in\r\nthe case of tumors. They are unrestrained, lawless.\r\n\r\nMetastasis expresses the lawlessness of tumors as regards being limited to\r\nthe original site of development. Small particles of tumors enter the blood\r\nvessels or lymph streams and are carried to distant parts of the body,\r\nwhere they lodge and start new tumor formations. Expansion by colonization\r\nin this manner is a rule with many tumors, and, since they exercise no\r\nfunction of use to the organism, this dissemination of actively growing\r\nparticles becomes a menace to the system by numerically increasing the\r\nbody's burden, opening new channels of drain upon the system and adding new\r\ncenters for the absorption of putrefactive materials when the secondary\r\ntumors shall have degenerated. It is this which makes metastasis such an\r\nimportant element in the malignancy of tumors.\r\n\r\nTumors possess no physiological function. They are absolutely useless.\r\nFibrous tumors bind no parts of the organism together; bony tumors add\r\nnothing to the supporting framework of the body; the tissue of fatty tumors\r\nnever serves as a storehouse of feed and energy; the cells of an adenoma,\r\nor gland tumor, furnish no secretion; a tumor composed of muscle tissue\r\nproduces no increase to the strength of the individual--its muscle cells\r\nare not contractile.\r\n\r\nTumors arise from cells of preexistent tissue. Tumor tissue is not a new\r\nvariety. Whatever the structure of a tumor, its counterpart is found among\r\nthe tissues of the body, the lawlessness of the tumor, however, showing\r\nitself in more or less departure from the normal type. This departure is\r\nusually a reversion to a more elementary or embryonic stage, so that the\r\ntumor tissues may be said to be structurally immature.\r\n\r\nTumors arise without obvious cause. Concerning the ultimate cause of tumor\r\nformation we are absolutely ignorant. Various theories have been advanced\r\nfrom time to time, but none of them have been applicable to more than a\r\nlimited number of cases. The most important theories may be briefly\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n(1) _The theory of tumor diathesis._--Bilroth taught that tumors are caused\r\nby a peculiar predisposition consisting of a diseased state of the fluids\r\nof the body. This constitutional taint might be acquired, but, having been\r\nacquired, is also hereditary. This theory is known also as the heredity\r\nhypothesis, but, while it is true that heredity appears to play some role\r\nin the causation of certain neoplasms, its application is too limited to\r\nmake it of value.\r\n\r\n(2) _The mechanical or irritant theory._--Virchow assumed that tumors arise\r\nas the result of previous irritation of the part. This has been noticed\r\nparticularly in the case of certain cancers. They frequently develop on the\r\nedges of old ulcers, thus being dependent apparently on chronic irritation.\r\nCancer of the lip in pipe smokers is a case in point. Cancerous tumors of\r\nthe skin often develop on the arms of workers in paraffin, tar, or soot,\r\nthe chemical irritation of these substances being the cause. On the\r\ncontrary, the proportion of those thus affected among the exposed is very\r\nsmall and forces the conclusion that if the real cause were in the\r\nirritation vastly more cases would occur.\r\n\r\n(3) _The theory of nervous influence._--That is based upon (_a_) the\r\nobserved fact that tumors occur more frequently in man and the higher\r\nanimals than in those lower in the scale, among which the nervous system is\r\nless highly developed; (_b_) that certain formations seem to be directly\r\nconnected with nerve distribution, while others have been associated with\r\nalternations in neighboring nerve trunks.\r\n\r\n(4) _The embryonal theory._--This is known also as Cohnheim's hypothesis.\r\nIn early fetal life there occurs a production of cells in excess of those\r\nrequired for the construction of the various parts of the body, so that a\r\ncertain number of them are left over in the fully developed tissue or\r\nbecome misplaced during the sorting of cells for future development of\r\ntissues and organs. These cells lie dormant until favorable conditions\r\narise or until some sufficient stimulus is applied, when, released from\r\ntheir inactivity, they begin to reproduce and grow. Not being normally\r\nrelated to their site, they lack the controlling and limiting influences of\r\nthe part, and, their embryonic character enduing them with a most potent\r\nproliferating power, they develop in a lawless and unrestrained manner.\r\nThere are tumors whose existence can be explained only on these grounds.\r\nStill, this theory falls far short of answering the question as to the\r\norigin of tumors.\r\n\r\n(5) _The parasitic theory._--This is not only one of the latest, but,\r\nmerely as a hypothesis, it is the most attractive and plausible of all. The\r\nserious objections to it, however, are the almost uniform failure that has\r\nmet the attempts to transplant these tumors from one animal to another and\r\nthe absence of any constant variety of organism in them. Several forms of\r\nparasites have been found in certain tumors, but nothing definite has been\r\nshown with reference to the relation they bear to the causation of the\r\nneoplasm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF TUMORS.\r\n\r\nIn Senn's work on tumors occurs the following: \"A uniform system of\r\nclassification of tumors is one of the great wants of modern pathology, and\r\nall attempts in this direction have proved failures.\" It would be folly,\r\ntherefore, to burden the pages of a work of this kind with one or several\r\nof the proposed systems which have, admittedly, at some important point,\r\nfailed of their purpose. Since the value of this chapter depends chiefly\r\nupon its practical character, which in turn is measured by its aid in\r\ndiagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, the old but important clinical\r\ndivision is here adopted.\r\n\r\nTumors are either malignant or benign. The essential difference between the\r\ntwo classes is that while _benign tumors depend for their ill effects\r\nentirely upon their situation, malignant neoplasms wherever located\r\ninevitably destroy life._ The clinical features of each group are in many\r\ncases sufficiently marked to distinguish them.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIGNANT TUMORS.\r\n\r\n(1) These are invariably pernicious, and from the beginning tend to destroy\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n(2) The cellular element predominates; therefore they grow rapidly.\r\n\r\n(3) Possessing no capsule, they infiltrate surrounding tissues.\r\n\r\n(4) They infect adjacent lymph glands.\r\n\r\n(5) They recur even after complete removal.\r\n\r\n(6) They give metastasis; that is, they become disseminated in different\r\norgans.\r\n\r\n(7) Their presence develops a progressive emaciation.\r\n\r\n\r\nBENIGN TUMORS.\r\n\r\n(1) These in and of themselves do not tend to produce death.\r\n\r\n(2) As the cellular element is not liable to predominate, they grow slowly.\r\n\r\n(3) They are encapsulated, and when diffuse do not infiltrate surrounding\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\n(4) They do not infect adjacent lymph glands.\r\n\r\n(5) They do not recur after complete removal.\r\n\r\n(6) They do not manifest metastasis.\r\n\r\nBenign tumors, though harmless, may, by the accident of their location,\r\nindirectly produce death. Mere pressure on the brain substance of an\r\notherwise innocent tumor, compression of the blood supply for vital organs,\r\ngrowth in such manner as to cause obstruction in the alimentary tract or\r\npressure upon nerves, may cause death, or, prior to death, so combine the\r\neffects of anemia (deficiency of blood), starvation, and pain, with its\r\nconsequent restlessness, as to produce a veritable cachexia (condition of\r\ngeneral ill health).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a malignant tumor in its primary growth may so implicate\r\na vital organ as to destroy life before metastasis can occur or even before\r\ncachexia can develop. Thus, to the untrained observer, environment may so\r\noperate as to cause these two classes of new growths to simulate each\r\nother. The boundary lines may seem to overlap. It is here that the\r\nmicroscope, as the court of last appeal, adjudicates positively in the\r\ndiagnosis between these two clearly marked divisions.\r\n\r\nIt may almost be asserted that a true classification of tumors can not be\r\nmade until we know more about the cause of them. The arrangement here\r\npresented is offered to meet the practical needs of the veterinarian,\r\nstudent, and farmer rather than of the pathologist.\r\n\r\nWe may roughly divide the tissues of the body into structural and lining\r\ntissues. The structural tissues are composed of the tissues of special\r\nfunction and simple connective tissues. The lining or covering tissues,\r\nboth internal and external, are known as epithelium.\r\n\r\nSection A of the table below contains the true tumors or proper neoplasms.\r\n\r\nSection B includes the cysts, some of which are true tumors, while others\r\nare false ones, but the latter are added because of their gross resemblance\r\nto the true and the consequent necessity of considering them at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TUMORS AND CYSTS.\r\n\r\n  A.--Tumors.\r\n\r\n  BENIGN.\r\n\r\n  I.--_Tumors composed of tissues resembling those of special function._\r\n\r\n  1.

The Greek\r\nword \"oma\" (plural \"omata\") means tumor. This word \"oma\" is added to the\r\nstem of the word ordinarily used to designate the kind of tissue of which\r\nthe tumor is composed. Thus a tumor formed after the type of fibrous tissue\r\nis a fibroma. The only exception to this is in the naming of the two large\r\nclasses of malignant neoplasms. There the names were formed from the\r\nfleshlike appearance of the one and the crablike proliferations of the\r\nother--namely, Sarcoma (sarks=flesh), carcinoma (karkinos=crab).\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS.--In the diagnosis of tumors note is taken of (1) clinical\r\nhistory and (2) examination of the tumor.\r\n\r\n(1) _Clinical history._--Circumstances connected with the origin of the\r\ntumor and its rapidity of growth may point to an inflammatory swelling\r\nrather than a tumor. The location of the tumor at its commencement is\r\nimportant, as, for instance, in diagnosing between lipoma and carcinoma,\r\nthe former being more or less movable under the skin, while a carcinoma\r\ndevelops in the skin. While tenderness on pressure may be caused by\r\ncompression of a sensitive nerve by a tumor or by tumors of the nerve or\r\nnerve sheaths, as a rule this symptom is indicative of inflammatory\r\nswelling rather than of the existence of a tumor.\r\n\r\n(2) _Direct examination of the tumor._--In the application of this\r\ndiagnosis the trained observer will note color, size, shape, and surface\r\nstructure, transmission of light, movableness, consistence, resistance,\r\npulsation, and crepitation. Percussion, auscultation, and exploration are\r\nalso available methods. Finally, microscopic examination of the growing\r\nportions of the tumor by a pathologist will be found most satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL TREATMENT OF TUMORS.\r\n\r\nFor benign tumors treatment is required only when it damages the animal's\r\nvalue or when merely for sake of appearance. When it is possible, the\r\nremoval of the tumor by an operation is indicated. If the tumor has a\r\nsmall, constricted base, remove by torsion, ligation, or with an Ècraseur.\r\nLigation following the incision of the skin with a knife avoids the pain of\r\npressing on the sensitive nerves of the skin and is suitable for tumors of\r\nbroad base and small bodies. A firing iron, such as is used in line or\r\nfeather firing, may also be used in removing tumors with small attachments.\r\nThis not only stops the bleeding but forms a firm scab, under which healing\r\nmay occur rapidly. Those tumors that can not be removed by the above\r\nmethods may be treated with caustics or acids, such as sulphuric acid,\r\nhydrochloric acid, caustic potash, arsenic, silver nitrate, or chromic\r\nacid, but it is difficult to limit the action of these drugs. The\r\ninjection, into the tumor, of such chemicals as anilin dyes, alcohol,\r\nacetic acid, citric acid, or ergotin, is of doubtful value, as is also the\r\ninjection of the germs of erysipelas--thought by some to be a specific.\r\nCertain specific tumors, such as actinomycosis and botryomycosis, may be\r\nsuccessfully treated by the internal administration of potassium iodid,\r\ntogether with the injection into the tumor or the painting of its surface\r\nwith either Lugol's solution or the tincture of iodin. The most reliable\r\nmeans of treating tumors is by extirpation with cutting instruments.\r\nDissect the tumor from the surrounding tissue, ligating all the larger\r\nblood vessels, and tearing the tissues with the fingers rather than cutting\r\nwith a knife. The bleeding may be stopped with a hot iron. The after\r\ntreatment is the same as for any ordinary wound of similar size.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL TUMORS.\r\n\r\nAlthough a full list of the tumors that may be found in bovines has been\r\ngiven above, there are a number that warrant a detailed description, and\r\nthe following mention will be made of the most important of them:\r\n\r\n\r\nMYOMA.\r\n\r\nThese tumors are after the type of muscle. They are sharply circumscribed\r\nand, as a rule, are very hard, a condition owing usually to combination\r\nwith fibroma and are then known as fibromyoma. In fact, the clinical\r\ndifferentiation between myoma and fibroma is almost impossible. Myomas are\r\nfound in the uterus, vagina, stomach, intestines, gullet, and bladder of a\r\nbovine animal. They grow very large, but, as a rule, are benign. Treatment\r\nshould consist of their removal.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEUROFIBROMA.\r\n\r\nA true neuroma built up of nerve fibers and nerve cells is infrequent, if\r\nit ever occurs, in cattle. False neuromas, or neurofibromas, are knotty,\r\nspreading tumors of the size of a large potato, which are developed within\r\nthe nerve sheaths and composed of nerve fibers and connective tissue bands\r\ninterlaced. The commingling of these varied fibers is often so intricate\r\nthat separation is practically impossible. This tumor is most frequently\r\nfound upon the shoulder of cattle. Treatment is surgical.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGIOMA.\r\n\r\nThe angiomas are tumors composed mainly of blood vessels or blood spaces\r\nand are observed on the skin of man, where they are called \"birthmarks\" or\r\n\"mother marks.\" Cavernous angiomas are seen in cattle, affecting the liver\r\nand the mucous membrane of the nasal septum. In the liver they appear as\r\nsmooth, flat, nonprojecting tumors of a dark-red or purple color and of\r\nabout the size of a silver 10-cent piece. They are somewhat softer in\r\nconsistency than the adjoining liver substance into which they are\r\ngradually fused. These tumors are frequently observed by meat inspectors in\r\nlivers of slaughtered cattle. Treatment of angioma is unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nADENOMA.\r\n\r\nThe structure of this tumor is after the type of gland tissue. It is rarely\r\nseen in cattle except in combination with cancer or sarcoma. A growth which\r\noccurs more frequently in bovines, especially calves, and which in some\r\ninstances bears a striking resemblance to an adenoma is the so-called\r\ngoiter.\r\n\r\n\r\nGOITER (STRUMA).\r\n\r\nThis is a noninflammatory enlargement or a hyperplasia of the thyroid\r\ngland. While it can not be definitely classed among tumors, yet, owing to\r\nits resemblance to the latter, it will be discussed at this time. The cause\r\nof goiter has never been definitely ascertained. Among the most probable\r\ncauses may be mentioned heredity, insufficient and improper diet, close\r\nconfinement, unhygienic surroundings, and an unknown toxic substance which\r\nis supposed to obtain in those localities rich in magnesium and lime salts.\r\nCertain organisms found in goiter have been suspected of producing this\r\ntrouble, but their relation to the disease has not been satisfactorily\r\nproved. A goiter may consist of (1) simple enlargement of the follicles\r\nwhich are filled with albuminous matter (follicular goiter); (2) an\r\nincrease of connective tissues between the follicles, causing the swelling\r\nto be dense and resistant (fibrous goiter); (3) a great increase in size of\r\none or more follicles, forming a cyst (cystic goiter); (4) great dilatation\r\nof the blood vessels in the gland accompanied with pulsation with each\r\nheart beat (vascular goiter).\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Goiter may be observed at the side of the throat, reaching the\r\nsize of a fist or even larger, or it may hang down below the windpipe. In\r\ncattle the two thyroid glands are close together, and when the disease\r\naffects both there may be but one uniform swelling placed in front of the\r\nwindpipe below the angle of the jaw. This swelling may be hard, soft, or\r\ndoughy in consistence, and with each beat of the heart it may pulsate like\r\nan artery. It may cause labored breathing by pressure on the windpipe, and\r\ndeath may result from pressure on this structure, on the gullet, or on the\r\nadjoining large vessels.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In young animals the treatment is usually satisfactory, and\r\nconsists in giving the animal a complete change of feed and plenty of\r\nexercise in the open air. If the condition appears enzootic in the\r\ndistrict, remove the animal to another location when possible. Iodin,\r\neither in the form of ointment or the tincture, should be applied to the\r\nswelling. Injections of iodin solution, 5 grains of iodin in 1 dram of 25\r\nper cent alcohol, may also be made into the substance of the gland. When\r\nthe swelling which follows this injection has subsided it may be repeated.\r\nPotassium iodid should be given internally in 1-1/2 dram doses twice daily\r\nfor a cow, or in 20-grain doses twice a day for a calf. Extirpation of all\r\nbut a small section of the swelling may be successfully accomplished by a\r\nqualified veterinarian, but if it should be entirely removed, myxedema and\r\ndeath follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIBROMA.\r\n\r\nFibromas are tumors made up chiefly of connective tissue and are usually\r\nconfined to the skin and subcutaneous tissue. Indurative fibromas of the\r\nskin appear as tumors of gelatinous connective tissue or as firm, white\r\nvascular connective tissue growths, which are more or less sharply\r\noutlined, move readily over the underlying tissues in company with the\r\nskin, and owe their origin to mechanical injuries, perforating wounds,\r\nrepeated abrasions, or the invasion of pus cocci or botryomyces into the\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThese tumors in cattle are frequently found upon the dewlap as solid lumps,\r\nhard as stone to the touch, lying loosely between the layers of skin, and\r\ngradually losing themselves in the softer tissues of the neck above, or as\r\nsmooth, hard tumors of glistening white substance with interlacing lines of\r\nsofter tissue. They may also be found in the region of the knee or at the\r\nelbow. The skin over the growths, in accordance with the originating cause,\r\nwill be found chafed, covered with scabs, or even ulcerated and accompanied\r\nwith collateral edema.\r\n\r\nThese connective tissue tumors grow slowly but reach enormous size. They\r\nsometimes follow injuries to the region of the throat and form there as\r\nhard, firm growth, even reaching the size of a child's head.\r\n\r\nA fibroma upon the larynx is not an infrequent occurrence in the ox. These\r\ntumors are always sharply outlined and have a roughened surface. They may\r\nbe differentiated from actinomycotic tumors (see chapter on \"Infectious\r\ndiseases of cattle,\" p. 358) in the same location by their firm, fibrous\r\nstructure and by the absence of pus from the interior.\r\n\r\nA tumor is sometimes seen upon the muzzle of cattle, which assumes a\r\ndiameter equaling the width of the muzzle. It is a voluminous\r\nconnective-tissue formation known by the name of \"fibroma diffusum.\"\r\n\r\nAnother form is sometimes observed upon the tongue. It grows upon a broad,\r\nspreading base, becoming very hard. It is almost lacking in blood vessels,\r\nalthough the few that are present are plainly in view, and in consequence\r\nis poorly supplied with fluids. It is of a smooth contour, white or whitish\r\nyellow in color, is sharply limited from the normal substance of the\r\ntongue, may be covered with mucous membrane, on which prominent papillÊ are\r\nlocated, or only by a thin, delicate layer of epithelium, and is usually\r\nfound in the middle part of the tongue, where it may reach the size of two\r\nfists.\r\n\r\nPedunculate or stemmed fibrous tumors are frequently noticed growing upon\r\nor near the extremity of the tails of cows. They are apparently of\r\ntraumatic origin, such as tying the tail fast while milking or shaving it\r\ntoo closely while trimming for show purposes, and usually contain bloody or\r\ngelatinous material within, or, again, they may be strongly edematous\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of large fibromas is surgical and consists of\r\nthe operative removal of the tumor, followed by suturing of the wound.\r\nSmall external tumors may be painted with zinc chlorid, chromic acid, or a\r\nconcentrated solution of bichlorid of mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPILLOMA (WART).\r\n\r\nWhen fibromas develop from the lining or covering tissues they frequently\r\nform papillary growths, more or less thickly covered with epithelium, and\r\nare then called papillomas, or warts.\r\n\r\nPapillomas consist of villouslike projections, resulting from a\r\nproliferation of the outer layer (epithelium) of the skin or mucous\r\nmembrane. These growths are also called \"angle berries,\" and may assume a\r\nvariety of forms. Sometimes there is a preponderance of epidermis in the\r\nformation, and the tumor then appears as a hard, dense, insensitive,\r\nclublike growth, or wart. Again the swelling is chiefly in the derm, or\r\ntrue skin, and we have what is known as a flesh wart (verucca carnea). In\r\nother cases the growth of papillar bodies projects in great cauliflowerlike\r\ntumors with deeply furrowed and lobulated surface, over which a covering of\r\nepidermis may or may not be present. These are usually much softer and are\r\nwell supplied with blood vessels. It is not uncommon for them to be\r\npedunculate or stemmed, and in this case considerable rotary motion or\r\ntwisting is possible. Their color is cloudy gray or grayish red, with white\r\nbands of connective tissue radiating from the center. Their consistence\r\nvaries. Upon their surfaces and within their clefts and fissures they\r\nundergo retrogressive changes, softening, bleeding, or ulcerations.\r\n\r\nA favorite location for the papilloma in cattle is the udder and teats,\r\nwhere they may develop in such numbers as to cover the entire surface and\r\nmake the animal troublesome to milk. The sides of the head, neck, and\r\nshoulders also afford satisfactory conditions for their growth, and are\r\nfrequently seen to be affected by them.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Warts may be removed with the scissors, twisted off with the\r\nfingers, or ligatured by means of a rubber band or horsehair. The roots\r\nshould then be cauterized with tincture of iron, glacial acetic acid, or\r\nlunar caustic. Acids should never be used in removing warts about the eyes\r\nor in the mouth. Papillomas of the eyelids sometimes change to cancers and\r\nshould be removed by taking out a wedge-shaped section of the eyelid. Young\r\ncattle should be given arsenic internally in the form of Fowler's solution,\r\n1 tablespoonful twice a day for a 6-months-old calf.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLYPS.\r\n\r\nPolyps are usually fibromas or myxomas, occurring on the mucous membrane of\r\nthe nasal passages or genital tract. They grow upon a narrow stem, bleed\r\nreadily when injured, and often contain a center of thin, limpid fluid. A\r\nbloody discharge is sometimes seen coming from the affected nostril, but\r\nthis is not always easy of detection in cattle, owing to the pliancy of\r\ntheir tongues and to their habit of licking an irritated nostril. Usually\r\nthese tumors grow downward and may project from the nostril, causing\r\nsnoring sounds and uneasy breathing. They may occasionally force themselves\r\nbackward into the throat, where they interfere seriously with respiration,\r\nthe patient being obliged to breathe with an effort, and even forced to\r\ncough in order to dislodge temporarily the obstruction from the larynx.\r\nSuch tumors, when near the nostril, may easily be removed by the use of\r\nforceps or a loop made of bailing wire. Serious bleeding is not liable to\r\nfollow their removal, but an astringent wash, such as a solution of the\r\nperchlorid of iron, if applied to the cut surface, will be found very\r\nbeneficial. In case the tumor is not within easy reach, the services of a\r\nqualified veterinarian should be obtained to perform the necessary\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIPOMA.\r\n\r\nThis is a tumor consisting chiefly of fat cells. The growth is irregularly\r\nrounded and distinctly lobulated, very soft, and almost fluctuating. It is\r\ninsensitive, grows slowly, and is always inclosed in a distinct fibrous\r\ncapsule, from which it can be easily shelled out. It may become very large\r\nand often hangs pendulous from a long, elastic pedicle. In cattle this\r\ntumor may be found in the subcutaneous tissues, especially of the back and\r\nshoulders, uterus, and intestines, and in the latter position it may cause\r\nstrangulation, or \"gut tie,\" by winding around a loop of the intestine.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When found on the skin the tumor may be readily removed with\r\na knife or by a ligature. Caustics and the cautery produce wounds that heal\r\nslowly and can not be recommended in the treatment of this tumor.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHONDROMA.\r\n\r\nThis tumor formation is composed of cartilage cells. It is a rounded and\r\nvery often unevenly nodular and sharply described tumor. It is very hard,\r\ndense, elastic, and painless and develops principally where we find normal\r\ncartilage cells. It is rare in cattle, but has been found in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues and nasal cavities.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Extirpation.\r\n\r\n\r\nOSTEOMA (BONY TUMOR).\r\n\r\nBones may occasionally grow in such a profuse and irregular manner that the\r\nproduct, or osteophyte, assumes the character of a tumor. The bone tissue\r\nmay possess either spongy or compact properties and grow either from the\r\nperiphery of the bone or within its interior. These tumors most frequently\r\nappear about the head of the animal, either upon the jawbones, within the\r\nnasal passages, or in connection with the horns. They are usually of bony\r\nhardness, painless, benign, and sharply outlined.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment consists in either removing them with a saw,\r\nchisel, or trephine, or preventing their further development by\r\ncounterirritation with blisters or firing iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYXOMA.\r\n\r\nCharacteristic myxomas are mucoid tumors which chiefly originate from the\r\nmucous membrane and are especially to be found within the nasal passages\r\nand uteri of cattle. They can reach a size of three fists, are smooth or\r\nvelvetlike, or may be lobulated, broad at the base, and consist of a\r\nglassy-looking mass of connective tissue, which usually shows a distinctive\r\nyellowish color. Being homogeneous and elastic, the moist, jellylike tissue\r\ncomposing the tumor may be easily destroyed or crushed. When cut through,\r\nthese tumors soon collapse from the loss of their fluids. They sometimes\r\ninclose elliptical cavities filled with slimy, gelatinous masses.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Extirpation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCOMA.\r\n\r\nThis is a malignant tumor after the type of embryonal tissue, and consists\r\nof several varieties, such as the round cell, spindle cell, giant cell,\r\nalveolar, and melanosarcoma. They grow by preference in connective tissue\r\nand are quite vascular. Sarcomas appear either as single or multiple\r\nnodules, varying in size from a hempseed to a hazelnut, or else as a\r\nmoderate number of tumors of the size of hen eggs. Their surface, at first\r\nsmooth, later becomes lumpy and tuberous from internal degeneration.\r\nSecondary nodules may appear near the primary tumor. The outer skin is not\r\ninvolved so soon as in cancer, nor does ulceration follow so rapidly.\r\nSarcoma is about the most frequent and dangerous tumor that is found in\r\ncattle. It occurs in young animals, and is found on the serous membranes,\r\nin the glandular organs, and on the outer skin, especially of the neck and\r\nshoulders--in fact, in nearly every tissue and in almost every part of the\r\nbody. This tumor is often found in places exposed to traumatisms and at\r\nseats of scars, or of irritations from pressure and inflammation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment should consist in early and complete removal by the\r\nknife, including one-half or three-quarters of an inch of the sound tissue\r\nadjoining the tumor. If there is a possibility that sarcomatous tissue\r\nstill remains, either cauterize the wound with a hot iron or powder the\r\nwalls of the cavity with arsenious acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANCER (CARCINOMA).\r\n\r\nCancers are tumors of epithelial tissues and are malignant. There are\r\nseveral varieties of cancers, such as hard, soft, and colloid, but only\r\nthose growing on the surface will be mentioned here. These malignant tumors\r\nof the superficial organs develop primarily from the epidermis or from the\r\nglands of the skin. They appear secondarily as spreading infections from\r\nmilk glands, thyroids, anal glands, or as embolisms. In such cases their\r\nsole character depends wholly upon the kind of cancer from which they have\r\nsprung. The infiltrating cancer begins as an elevation of the skin, which\r\nprogresses until it becomes rough and nodular. The surface later becomes\r\nattacked, and an ulcer results whose edges are outlined by a hard, firm\r\nzone.\r\n\r\nThe ulcerations may remain limited by cicatricial tissue, but it is more\r\nlikely that the infiltration and destruction of tissue will spread out\r\nwider and deeper until a rodent ulcer (so called) is formed. One of the\r\nmost frequent sites of cancer in cattle is in the eye, where they are\r\ncalled fungus hematodes, but they also occur on the skin, on the genitals,\r\nin the stomach, and within the organs.\r\n\r\n_Fungus hematodes._--This starts at the inner corner of the eye as a\r\npapillary elevation or as small nodules which become fused. They grow\r\nlarger and become papillomatous, with superficial ulcerations and a\r\ntendency toward hemorrhage. In some cases the eye is displaced by the\r\ngrowing tumor or is attacked by the cancer cells and entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nCancerous growths upon the external genitals and the anus usually present a\r\nrough, irregular surface from which there is a constant sloughing of\r\ndecomposed tissue accompanied with a penetrating disagreeable odor.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of cancer may be made clinically by noting the simultaneous\r\ninfection of the lymph glands which surround the primary lesion. Deeply\r\nburrowing and infiltrating forms which appear as lumps and ulcerations\r\ncause marked disfiguration of the affected part. The surface becomes a\r\nsoft, greasy mass; later it cracks open and from the fissures blood-colored\r\npus exudes, being continually formed by the moist degeneration of the\r\ntissues beneath. At first the general health of the animal does not appear\r\naffected, but later the cancer nodules spread to important organs and give\r\nrise to marasmus and progressive emaciation. Cancer is not a frequent tumor\r\nof cows. Frˆhner states that of 75 cases of tumors in cattle which came\r\nunder his observation 2, or 2.6 per cent, were found to be cancers, while\r\n20, or 26.6 per cent, were sarcomas.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in the early and complete removal of the\r\ntumor, taking care to include a wide border of healthy tissue. This has\r\nbeen most successful in such superficial cancers as those of the eye,\r\npenis, anus, testicle, vulva, and sheath. If the disease has advanced too\r\nfar, this treatment may not prove efficacious, owing to the great\r\nmalignancy of the cancer and its tendency to recur. In such cases the\r\nanimal may be slaughtered, but the flesh should be used for food only after\r\ninspection by a competent veterinarian.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYSTS.\r\n\r\nCysts may be true or false tumors and consist of a capsule containing a\r\nfluid or semisolid content. Among the most important cysts, which have been\r\nbriefly referred to in a previous table, the following are probably the\r\nmost noteworthy, owing to the frequency with which they are found in\r\nbovines:\r\n\r\n\r\nSOFTENING CYSTS.\r\n\r\nSoftening cysts, which result from the degenerative liquefaction of normal\r\nor diseased tissues, especially of tumors of different kinds, followed by\r\nthe encapsulation of the fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITIC CYSTS.\r\n\r\nParasitic or foreign-body cysts, from the inflammatory reaction induced by\r\nsuch parasites as the echinococcus (hydatid cyst) or by the presence of\r\nvarious kinds of foreign bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXTRAVASATION CYSTS.\r\n\r\nExtravasation cysts, caused by injuries which rupture blood vessels,\r\nfollowed by an increase of fibrous tissue which forms a capsule about the\r\nfluid. The hygromata in front of the knee in cattle, so-called tumor of the\r\nknee, and serous cysts belong to this variety.\r\n\r\nHYGROMATA, OR TUMORS OF THE KNEE.--These consist in the simplest form of a\r\ncollection of serous fluid mixed with fibrin within a distended bursa. The\r\nwalls surrounding the fluid become firm, smooth, and dense.\r\n\r\nOutwardly the tumor appears fluctuating, though tense, while the skin which\r\ncovers it may be normal, denuded of hair, or covered with hard epidermal\r\nscales, possibly half an inch in thickness, forming a hard, horny plate.\r\nThe cavity which contains the fluid may have the dimensions of a hen's egg,\r\nan apple, or a child's head. Its walls are formed by the diseased secreting\r\nmembrane of the bursal sac, and are readily detachable from the subcutis of\r\nthe skin. Their internal surfaces are often uneven or supplied with\r\nprojections or tufted growths which support a fibrous network within the\r\ntumor.\r\n\r\nTumors of the knee may also assume a granular type, as the result of\r\nchronic inflammation or following operative or spontaneous evacuation of\r\npus from the part. They are either firmly connected with the skin or are\r\ndetachable from it, and when laid open disclose a whitish-red, porklike\r\ntissue surrounding a central nucleus of pus, or a fistulous tract leading\r\nto the outer surface. They are caused by the chronic inflammation which\r\nfollows the bruises received by cattle in lying down and in rising, or they\r\nmay be due to falls on uneven, hard ground.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for hygromata._--When the swelling first appears cold water\r\nshould be applied, followed later by bandaging with cloths wrung out of\r\nwarm water. If the swelling is soft, it should be punctured at the lowest\r\npoint, and afterwards the cavity should be syringed with Lugol's solution.\r\nIf the tumor is hard and nonfluctuating, a mercurial blister may cause\r\nabsorption and at the same time prevent further injury to the part by\r\nmaking it more painful, thus sparing it.\r\n\r\nSEROUS CYSTS.--These swellings are another variety of extravasation cysts,\r\nand are caused by such injuries as butting, running against hard objects,\r\nand shipping bruises, which are followed by an outpouring of blood and\r\nlymph into the tissue spaces. These cysts develop rapidly and may reach the\r\nsize of a man's head or even larger. They are soft, edematous, and hot at\r\nfirst and contain a serous or blood-tinged fluid. Later, partially\r\norganized clots and shreds of a fibrinous nature and of a gelatinous\r\nconsistence are formed within, and the temperature of the swelling is\r\nreduced. They appear on the surface of the body, especially on the belly\r\nand flank of cattle.\r\n\r\n_Treatment of serous cysts._--Treatment consists in opening the cyst at the\r\nmost dependent point with a sharp knife. The cavity should be washed out\r\ntwice daily with a 5 per cent solution of carbolic acid, and drainage\r\nencouraged by keeping the incision open.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERMOID CYSTS.\r\n\r\nThese cysts have a wall which is almost an exact duplicate of the structure\r\nof the skin, and frequently contain epidermal structures, such as hair and\r\nteeth, which, in the development of the embryo, have been misplaced. Thus\r\nwe may find in an ovary or testicle a dermoid cyst, containing a tooth or a\r\nball of hair. Dental cysts are included in the class above.\r\n\r\nDENTAL CYSTS.--It happens occasionally that the teeth of cattle, instead of\r\ndeveloping normally within strong supporting alveolÊ, remain inclosed\r\nwithin a cystic membrane, which assumes a tumorlike character. One tooth\r\nmay be included alone in the cyst or a number may be inclosed together.\r\nHowever this may be, the malformation progresses, especially if confined to\r\nthe incisor teeth, until the remaining teeth that began to develop normally\r\nare crowded out of position and rendered useless. The tumor may reach the\r\nsize of a man's fist. It appears to be fleshy and dents upon pressure, but\r\nit may also appear on closer examination as though it contained irregular\r\nsections of thin bone. The outer surface is always smooth, and no\r\nindication of purulence, softening, or scab formation is ever exhibited.\r\nUpon being laid open with the knife the tumor is seen to be surrounded by a\r\nfirm, smooth membrane which limits it completely from the adjoining\r\ntissues. It is filled with material which possesses partly edematous,\r\npartly fleshy, and partly bony properties. It is supposed that this mass is\r\ncomposed of rudiments of the jawbone or of the alveolar walls which,\r\nbecoming spongy, lose themselves in the soft, fleshy mass contained within\r\nthe capsule of the tumor. It occasionally happens that the tumor is hollow\r\nand that the cavity extends back into the body of the lower jaw for a\r\nconsiderable distance.\r\n\r\nTumors of this kind, being of congenital origin, are very naturally\r\nobserved most frequently in young cattle, but they may continue to expand\r\nfor a period of several months after the birth of the calf, even until they\r\nbecome troublesome and unsightly.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for dental cysts._--Treatment consists in the complete\r\nextirpation of the cyst and the destruction of the lining pouch by\r\ncuretting.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETENTION CYSTS.\r\n\r\nRetention cysts arise from the retention of normal secretions, owing to\r\nobstruction of a duct leading from a gland. The mucous cysts found in the\r\nmouth, udder, and vestibule of cows are samples of this form.\r\n\r\nMUCOUS CYSTS.--Saclike dependent tumors, caused by retention of the\r\nsecretions from the mucous glands, sometimes develop in the mouth, nose,\r\npharynx, and vulva of cattle. They are called \"mucous cysts.\" These are of\r\nsizes varying from peas to pigeon eggs, are roundish and translucent, and\r\nsurrounded by a delicate, vascular membrane. They contain a siruplike\r\nsubstance more or less thick and transparent and whitish yellow in color.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in the puncturing of the swelling, if accessible, and\r\nthe destruction of the cyst walls by the injection of Lugol's solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROLIFERATION CYSTS.\r\n\r\nThese are found especially in the ovaries of cows, called \"cystic ovaries,\"\r\nand may produce nymphomania (chronic bulling).\r\n\r\nThe treatment indicated in this case is the removal of the diseased\r\novaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] The term \"tumor\" literally means a swelling, and thus has been applied\r\nto the prominence caused by an overdistended bladder, to the enlargement of\r\npregnancy, to the swelling produced by an abscess, to the overgrowth of\r\ntissue (hyperplasia) associated with injury and consequent inflammation,\r\nand to numerous other phases of tissue enlargement directly connected with\r\nrecognized disease processes. For this reason it is becoming more common\r\nfor scientists to apply the word \"neoplasm\" to the new growths described in\r\nthis chapter. Because of the still popular use of the word \"tumor,\" it is\r\nretained in this chapter for the designation of those new growths to which\r\nthe sevenfold characterization of our descriptive definition applies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, D. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by John R. Mohler, V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.\r\n\r\nThe skin consists of two parts--a superficial layer, the epidermis, or\r\ncuticle, and the deep, or true, skin, the dermis, cutis vera, or corium.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis, cuticle, or scarf skin, is an epithelial structure, forming\r\na protective covering to the corium. It varies in thickness, is quite\r\ninsensible and nonvascular, and consists of a sheet of cells.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis is divided into a firm and transparent superficial and a\r\ndeep, soft layer. The latter is the rete mucosum, whose cells contain the\r\npigment which gives color to the skin. The deep surface of the epidermis is\r\naccurately molded on the papillary layer of the true skin, and, when\r\nremoved by maceration, presents depressions which correspond to the\r\nelevations on the dermis. From the cuticle tubular prolongations pass into\r\nthe sebaceous and sudorific glands; thus the entire surface of the body is\r\ninclosed by the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe dermis, or true skin, is vascular and highly sensitive, containing the\r\ntactile ends of the nerves of touch. It is covered by epidermis and\r\nattached to the underlying parts by a layer of areolar tissue, which\r\nusually contains fat. The cutis consists of a fibro-areolar tissue and\r\nvessels of supply. It is divided into two layers, the deep, or true, corium\r\nand the upper, or papillary. The corium consists of strong interlacing\r\nfibrous bands, chiefly white; its meshes are larger and more open toward\r\nthe attached surface, giving lodgment to the sweat glands and fat. The\r\npapillary, or superficial, layer is formed of a series of small conical\r\neminences or papillÊ, which are highly sensitive, and consists of a\r\nhomogenous, transparent tissue. The blood vessels form dense capillary\r\nplexuses in the corium, terminating by loops in the papillÊ. The papillary\r\nnerves run in a waving manner, usually terminating in loops.\r\n\r\nHair is an appendage of the skin and forms its external covering. It is a\r\nspecial modification of epidermis, having the same essential structure, and\r\nconsists of a root, shaft, and point. The root has a bulbous extremity, is\r\nlighter and softer than the stem, and is lodged in a recess or hair\r\nfollicle, which may either be in the corium or subcutaneous areolÊ. The\r\nfollicle is dilated at the bottom to correspond to the root bulb, and the\r\nducts of one or more sebaceous glands open into it. At the bottom of each\r\nfollicle is a conical, vascular papilla, similar in every respect to those\r\non the surface of the dermis; this papilla fits into a corresponding\r\ndepression in the root of the hair. The shaft consists of a center, or\r\nmedulla, a surrounding fibrous portion, and an external coating, or cortex.\r\nThe medulla consists of cells containing pigment or fat, is opaque, and\r\ndeeply colored. All kinds of hair do not have this medulla. The fibrous\r\nportion occupies the bulk of the stem, and the cortex is merely a single\r\nlayer of thin, flat, imbricated (shinglelike) scales.\r\n\r\nThe sebaceous glands, lodged in the corium, are most abundant in parts\r\nexposed to friction. They generally open into the hair follicles,\r\noccasionally on the surface of the body. Each gland consists of a small\r\nduct which terminates in a lobulated recess. These lobules vary, and are,\r\nas is the duct, lined with epithelium. They are filled with sebaceous\r\nmatter which, as it is secreted, is detached into the sacs.   They are very\r\nplentiful between the claws of cattle.\r\n\r\nThe sudorific glands, or sweat glands, are situated in the subcutaneous\r\nareolar tissue, surrounded by a quantity of fat. They are small, round,\r\nreddish bodies, each of which consists of one or more fine tubes coiled\r\ninto a ball, the free end of the tube being continued up through the true\r\nskin and cuticle, and opening on the surface. Each sweat gland is supplied\r\nwith a cluster of capillary blood vessels which vary in size, being very\r\nlarge when perspiration is excessive. The contents of the smaller ones are\r\nfluid, and of the larger, semifluid.\r\n\r\nThe skin may be regarded as an organ supplementary in its action to the\r\nlungs and kidneys, since by its secretion it is capable of removing a\r\nconsiderable quantity of water from the blood; it also removes small\r\nquantities of carbon dioxid, salts, and in certain instances during\r\nsuppression of the renal secretions a small quantity of urea. The skin is\r\nalso the chief organ for the regulation of animal heat, by or through\r\nconduction, radiation, and evaporation of water, permitting of loss of\r\nheat, while it also, through other mechanisms, is able to regulate the heat\r\nlost. The hair furnishes protection against extreme and sudden variations\r\nof temperature by reason of the fact that hairs are poor conductors of\r\nheat, and inclose between them a still layer of air, itself a nonconductor.\r\nThe hairs are also furnished with an apparatus by which the loss of heat\r\nmay be regulated; thus, in cold weather, through the contraction of\r\nunstriped muscular fibers of the skin, the hairs become erect and the\r\nexternal coat becomes thicker. Cold, too, acts as a stimulus to the growth\r\nof hair, and we find, in consequence, a thicker coat in winter than in\r\nsummer. The hairs also furnish protection against wet, as they are always\r\nmore or less oily from the secretion of sebaceous glands, and thus shed\r\nwater. Through their elasticity they furnish mechanical protection, and\r\nthrough the thickness of the coat, to a certain degree, resist the attacks\r\nof insects.   Finally, the hairs assist the sense of touch.\r\n\r\nThe sweat glands are constantly discharging a watery secretion in the form\r\nof insensible perspiration, and by their influence act as regulators of the\r\ntemperature of the body; hence, in warm weather, the secretion of the skin\r\nis increased, which tends to prevent overheating. Sweating, in addition to\r\nregulating heat, is also an active agent in removing effete material from\r\nthe blood; therefore this secretion can not be checked without danger. If\r\nthe skin is covered with an impermeable coating of grease or tar, death\r\nresults from blood poisoning, owing to the retention of materials destined\r\nto be excreted by the skin.\r\n\r\nAll secretion poured out by the skin is not only modified by the condition\r\nof the atmosphere but also by the character and quantity of the food, by\r\nthe amount of exercise, and especially by the quantity of fluid taken.\r\n\r\nThe sebaceous secretion is intended to lubricate the skin and hairs. It\r\nconsists of soft, fatty material suspended in water, and is characterized\r\nby an odor peculiar to the animal by which it is secreted.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to classify the various diseases of the skin, for in a\r\nwork of this kind it would serve only to confuse the reader.\r\n\r\nWe shall first consider a class of diseases which are of an inflammatory\r\ntype; next, those caused by faulty secretion and abnormal growth; then,\r\ndiseases of parasitic origin; lastly, local injuries of the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRURITIS (ITCHING).\r\n\r\nWe shall consider pruritis first as a distinct subject. It is not a\r\ndisease, only a sensation, and therefore a symptom. It is one of the\r\nsymptoms accompanying the majority of the diseases which we will consider\r\nin this chapter. It is, then, a functional affection produced by slight\r\nirritation from without or by an internal cause acting upon the sensory\r\nnerves of the skin. Nothing characteristic is seen except the secondary\r\nlesions, produced mechanically by scratching or rubbing.\r\n\r\nThere are various forms of itching, the result of specific skin diseases,\r\nwhere the pruritis is a secondary symptom. In such cases it should not be\r\nregarded as an independent affection.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Many causes may induce the condition which we recognize here as\r\npruritis. The most common one is dirt on the skin, resulting from\r\ninsufficient care. If the ceiling of the stable is open, so that dust and\r\nstraw may fall, the skin is irritated and pruritis results. It also occurs\r\nin some forms of indigestion.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the body most exposed to this condition are the croup, the\r\nback, the top of the neck, and the root of the tail.\r\n\r\nAnother cause is found in affections of the liver and of the kidneys, when\r\nan increase of effete material has to be thrown off by the skin. Morbid\r\nmaterials circulating in the blood may produce a tickling or smarting\r\nsensation of the skin in their passage from the blood to the free surface\r\nof the skin. Certain irritating substances when eaten may be excreted by\r\nthe skin, and coming thus in direct contact with the sensory nerves produce\r\nitching, or may go further and cause distinct inflammation of the skin. In\r\nanother class of cases the pruritis may be ascribable to an atrophy,\r\ncontraction, or hardening of the skin, when the nerves become irritated by\r\nthe pressure. These conditions may be so slightly marked in a thick skin\r\nlike that of the ox that they can not be recognized. It is frequently\r\nnoticed that cattle rub themselves as soon as they pass from the stable\r\ninto the open air--changing from a warm to a cold atmosphere. Again, we may\r\nfind one that does all its rubbing in the stall. We may look for lice, but\r\nfail to find them. These conditions are generally attributable to high\r\nfeeding and to too close confinement. They may be associated with\r\ninflammatory irritation or not; certainly we fail to discover any morbid\r\nchanges in the skin. There is to some extent a delightful sensation\r\nproduced by rubbing, and it may partly become a habit of pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--We must place our chief reliance upon a change of food,\r\nplenty of exercise, and in most cases the administration of an active\r\ncathartic--1 to 1-1/2 pounds of Epsom salt, a handful of common salt, a\r\ntablespoonful of ginger or pepper, mixed with 2 quarts of water, all of\r\nwhich is to be given at one dose. Afterwards half an ounce of hyposulphite\r\nof soda mixed with the feed may be given twice a day for a week. For an\r\nexternal application, when the skin is abraded or thickened from rubbing, a\r\nsolution of borax, 4 ounces to the quart of water, may be used. Carbolic\r\nacid, 1/2 ounce to a quart of water, will give relief in some cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATORY DISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nERYTHEMA.\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest form of inflammation of the skin. It consists of an\r\nincreased redness, which may occur in patches or involve considerable\r\nsurface. The red coloration disappears when pressed by the finger, but soon\r\nreturns after the pressure is removed. There is seldom much swelling of the\r\naffected part, though often there is a glutinous discharge which dries and\r\nmats the hair or forms a thin scale upon the skin. In simple erythema the\r\nepidermis alone is affected; when it becomes chronic, fissures form and\r\nextend into the corium, or true skin.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Simple erythema, consisting of an inflammatory irritation, is\r\nseen in very young calves, in which the navels leak. The discharge being\r\nurine, it causes an irritation of the surrounding skin. Chafing, which is\r\nanother form of erythema, is occasionally seen on the udders of cows from\r\nrubbing by the legs; chafing between the legs is not uncommon among fat\r\nsteers. Chronic erythema is found in the form of chapped teats of cows and\r\nchapped lips in sucking calves. It frequently occurs in cows when they are\r\nturned out in winter directly after milking, and in others from chafing by\r\nthe sucking calf. Some cows are peculiarly subject to sore teats. The\r\nfissures when neglected in the early stage of formation become deep, very\r\npainful, often bleeding at the slightest touch, and when milked in that\r\ncondition cause the animal to become a kicker. Occasionally the lower\r\nportions of the legs become irritated and chapped when cattle are fed in a\r\nmuddy or wet yard in winter, or if they are compelled to wade through water\r\nin frosty weather. Another form of erythema occurs in young cattle highly\r\nfed and closely stabled for a long winter. The erythema appears in patches,\r\nand as it is most common near the end of the winter it is known as the\r\n\"spring eruption\" or \"spring itch.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In ordinary cases of erythema the removal of the cause and\r\nthe application of benzoated oxid of zinc ointment, carbolized cosmoline,\r\nor ichthyol ointment applied a few times, will restore the skin to a\r\nhealthy condition.\r\n\r\nWhen there are fissures the zinc ointment is the best. If at the teats, a\r\nmilk siphon (Pl. XXIV, fig. 4) should be used instead of milking by hand,\r\nand the calf, if one is suckled, should be taken away. The calf should be\r\nfed by hand if its mouth is affected. When the legs are irritated or\r\nchapped, dry stabling for a few days and the application of tar ointment\r\nwill soon heal them.\r\n\r\n\r\nURTICARIA (NETTLE RASH, OR SURFEIT).\r\n\r\nThis is a mild, inflammatory affection of the skin, characterized by sudden\r\ndevelopment of patches of various sizes, from that of a nickel to one as\r\nlarge as the hand. The patches of raised skin are marked by an abrupt\r\nborder and are irregular in form. All the swelling may disappear in a few\r\nhours, or it may go away in one place and reappear on another part of the\r\nbody. It is always accompanied with a great desire to rub the affected\r\npart. In its simplest type, as just described, it is never followed by any\r\nserous exudation or eruptions, unless the surface of the skin becomes\r\nabraded from scratching or rubbing.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Digestive derangements caused by overloading the stomach when\r\nthe animal is turned out to graze in the spring, certain feed constituents,\r\nhigh feeding of fattening stock, functional derangement of the kidneys,\r\nspinal and other nervous affections, are the most common sources of nettle\r\nrash.\r\n\r\nThe disease consists in paralysis of the nerve ends that control the volume\r\nof the capillary vessels in certain areas of skin, thus permitting the\r\nvessels to expand, their contents in part to exude, and thus produce a\r\nsoft, circumscribed swelling.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Administer a full dose of Epsom salt. Give soft, easily\r\ndigested feed, and wash the affected parts with a solution of bicarbonate\r\nof soda (common baking soda), 8 ounces to the gallon of water twice a day,\r\nor diluted glycerin may be applied to the skin. If it assumes a persistent\r\ntendency, give a tablespoonful of the following powder in the feed three\r\ntimes a day: Cream of tartar, sulphur, and nitrate of potassium, equal\r\nparts by weight; mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nECZEMA.\r\n\r\nEczema is a noncontagious inflammation of the skin, characterized by any or\r\nall of the results of inflammation at once or in succession, such as\r\nerythema, vesicles, or pustules, accompanied with more or less infiltration\r\nand itching, terminating in a watery discharge, with the formation of\r\ncrusts or in scaling off. The disease may run an acute course and then\r\ndisappear, or it may become chronic; therefore two varieties are\r\nrecognized, vesicular (or pustular) and chronic eczema.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Eczema is not so common among cattle as in horses and in dogs,\r\nin which it is the most common of all skin diseases. Among cattle it is\r\noccasionally observed under systems of bad hygiene, filthiness, lousiness,\r\novercrowding, overfeeding, excessively damp or too warm stables. It is\r\nfound to develop now and then in cattle that are fed upon sour substances,\r\ndistillery swill, house or garden garbage, etc. Localized eczema may be\r\ncaused by irritant substances applied to the skin--turpentine, ammonia, the\r\nessential oils, mustard, Spanish-fly ointment, etc. Occasionally an\r\neruption with vesiculation of the skin has been induced by the excessive\r\nuse of mercurial preparations for the destruction of lice. It is evident\r\nthat eczema may arise from local irritation to the skin or from an\r\nautointoxication. Cattle fed on the refuse from potato-starch factories\r\ndevelop a most obstinate and widespread eczema, beginning on the legs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In accordance with the variety of symptoms during the progress\r\nof the disease we may divide it into different stages or periods: (1)\r\nSwelling and increased heat of the skin; the formation of vesicles, which\r\nare circumscribed, rounded elevations of the epidermis, varying in size\r\nfrom a pinhead to a split pea, containing a clear, watery fluid; (2)\r\nexudation of a watery, glutinous fluid, formation of crusts, and sometimes\r\nsuppuration, or the formation of vesicles containing pus (pustules); (3)\r\nscaling off (desquamation), with redness, and thickening of the skin. From\r\nthe very beginning of the disease the animal commences to rub the affected\r\nparts; hence the various stages may not always be easily recognized, as the\r\nrubbing produces more or less abrasion, thus leaving the skin raw--\r\nsometimes bleeding. Neither do these symptoms always occur in regular\r\nsuccession, for in some cases the exudation is most prominent, being very\r\nprofuse, and serve to spread the disorder over a large surface. In other\r\ncases the formation of incrustations, or rawness of the skin, is the most\r\nstriking feature. The disease may be limited to certain small areas, or it\r\nmay be diffused over the greater part of the body; the vesicles, or\r\npustules, may be scattered in small clusters, or a large number run\r\ntogether. The chronic form is really only a prolongation of the disease,\r\nsuccessive crops of pustules appearing on various portions of the body,\r\nfrequently invading fresh sections of the skin, while the older surfaces\r\nform scabs, or crusts, upon the raw, indurated skin.\r\n\r\nIn old, standing cases the skin breaks, forming fissures, especially on\r\nportions of the body that bend--the neck and limbs. Thus the disease may be\r\nprolonged indefinitely. When eczema reaches its latest period, either acute\r\nor chronic, desquamation of the affected parts is the most prominent\r\nfeature. The formation and shedding of these successive crops of scales\r\nconstitute the character of the disease frequently denominated psoriasis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment of eczema is often anything but a pleasant\r\ntask. There is no one method of treatment which always proves successful,\r\nno matter how early it is begun or how small an area is involved. We must\r\nendeavor to remove the cause by giving attention to the general health of\r\nthe animal and to its environment. Feeding should be moderate in quantity\r\nand not too stimulating in character--green feed, bran mashes, ground oats,\r\nclean hay, plenty of salt. If the animal has been fed too high, give an\r\nactive purgative--Epsom salt preferred--once a week, if necessary, and\r\nhalf an ounce of acetate or nitrate of potassium may be given in the feed\r\ntwice a day. If the animal is in poor condition and debilitated, give a\r\ntablespoonful of the following mixture in feed twice a day: Powdered\r\ncopperas, gentian, sulphur, and sassafras bark, equal parts by weight. If\r\nthe animal is lousy, the parasite must be destroyed before the eczema can\r\nbe cured. The external treatment must vary with the character of the\r\nlesions; no irritating application is to be made while the disease is in\r\nits acute vesicular, or pustular, stage, and, in the chronic stage, active\r\nstimulants must be used. Much washing is harmful, yet crusts and scales\r\nmust be removed in order to obtain satisfactory results from the external\r\napplications. Both objects, however, can be attained by judiciously\r\ncombining the curative agents with such substances as will at the same time\r\ncleanse the parts.\r\n\r\nIn the vesicular stage, when the skin is feverish and the epidermis peeling\r\noff, thus exposing the exuding dermis, an application of boric-acid\r\nsolution, 2 drams of the acid to 8 ounces of water, often relieves the\r\nsmarting or itching, and also serves to check the exudation and dry the\r\nsurface. If this fails to have the desired effect compound cresol, 1 ounce\r\nto 2 quarts of water, should be used as a wash. Either of these washes may\r\nbe used several times a day until incrustation is well established. Then\r\ncompound cresol, 1 ounce to 2 quarts of sweet oil, or the benzoated oxid of\r\nzinc ointment, giving the affected surfaces a thorough application once a\r\nday, will be efficacious. When the eczema is not the result of an external\r\nirritant, it takes usually from one to two weeks to heal.\r\n\r\nIn chronic eczema, when there is a succession of scabs or scales, indolent\r\nsores or fissures, the white precipitate ointment, nitrate of mercury\r\nointment, or blue ointment, mixed with equal parts of cosmoline or fresh\r\nlard, may be applied every second day, taking care to protect the parts so\r\nthat the animal can not lick it off.\r\n\r\nThe internal administration of arsenic often yields excellent results in\r\nchronic eczema. Dissolve 1 dram of arsenic and 1 dram of carbonate of\r\npotassium in 1 pint of boiling water, and give 1 ounce of this twice a day\r\nin water, after feeding. An alkali internally may be of service. As such,\r\none may give 2 ounces of bicarbonate of soda twice daily. Sublimed sulphur\r\nmay also be tried in ounce doses twice daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUSTULES (IMPETIGO).\r\n\r\nImpetigo is an inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by the\r\nformation of distinct pustules, about the size of a pea or a bean, without\r\nitching. The pustules develop from the papular layer of the skin, and\r\ncontain a yellowish-white pus. After reaching maturity they remain\r\nstationary for a few days, then they disappear by absorption and dry up\r\ninto crusts, which later drop off, leaving upon the skin a red spot that\r\nsoon disappears. Occasionally the crusts remain firmly adherent for a long\r\ntime, or they may be raised and loosened by the formation of matter\r\nunderneath. The dry crusts usually have a brown or black appearance.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Impetigo affects sucking calves, in which the disease appears\r\nupon the lips, nostrils, and face. It is attributed to some irritant\r\nsubstance contained in the mother's milk. Impetigo is also witnessed among\r\ngrazing animals, regardless of age, and it especially attacks animals with\r\nwhite hair and skin. The mouth, face, and limbs become covered with\r\npustules, which may rupture in a few hours, followed by rapid and\r\nsuccessive incrustations; the scabs frequently coalesce, covering a large\r\nsurface; pus may form under them, and thus the whole thickness of the skin\r\nbecome involved in the morbid process. This form of the disease is\r\nattributed to the local irritant properties of such plants in the pasture\r\nas St. John's wort (_Hypericum perforatum_), smartweed (_Polygonum\r\nhydropiper_), vetches, honeydew, etc. Buckwheat, at the time the seeds\r\nbecome ripe, is said to have caused it; also bedding with buckwheat straw.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Sucking calves should be removed from the mother, and a\r\npurgative given to the latter to divert the poisonous substance secreted\r\nwith the milk. When the more formidable disease among grazing cattle\r\nappears, the pasturage should be changed and the affected parts of the\r\nanimal thoroughly anointed once a day with sweet oil containing 2 drams of\r\ncarbolic acid to the pint. This should be continued until the crusts soften\r\nand begin to drop off, then the parts may be cleansed thoroughly with warm\r\nwater and soap. Subsequently the white precipitate ointment or carbolized\r\ncosmoline should be applied daily until the parts are healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPEMPHIGUS (WATER BLISTERS).\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammatory disease of the skin, characterized by successive\r\nformations of rounded, irregularly shaped water blisters, varying in size\r\nfrom a pea to a hen's egg.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Obscure.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The formation of a blister is preceded by a congestion or\r\nswelling of the skin. Yellowish-colored water collects beneath the cuticle,\r\nwhich raises the latter from its bed in the form of a blister. The blisters\r\nappear in a succession of crops; as soon as one crop disappears another\r\nforms. They usually occur in clusters, each one being distinct, or they may\r\ncoalesce. Each crop usually runs its course in a week. The disease is\r\nattended with itching or burning sensations which cause the animal to rub,\r\nthereby frequently producing excoriations and formation of crust on the\r\naffected region.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Give a tablespoonful of the following-described mixture in\r\nfeed twice a day: Saltpeter, cream of tartar, and sulphur, equal parts by\r\nweight. The blisters should be opened as soon as formed, to allow the\r\nescape of the serum, followed by a wash composed of chlorid of zinc, 1 dram\r\nto 15 ounces of water. When there is any formation of crusts, carbolized\r\ncosmoline should be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURUNCULUS (BOILS).\r\n\r\nThis is an acute affection of the skin, usually involving its whole\r\nthickness, characterized by the formation of one or more abscesses,\r\noriginating generally in a sebaceous gland, sweat gland, or hair follicle.\r\nThey usually terminate by absorption, or by the formation of a central\r\ncore, which sloughs out, leaving a deep, round cavity that soon heals.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Impoverished state of blood, the result of kidney diseases or of\r\nlocal friction or contusions, with the entrance of pus cocci through the\r\ndamaged skin or through a hair follicle or a sebaceous gland.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Boils in cattle usually appear singly, not in clusters; they\r\nmay attain the size of a hen's egg. The abscess begins as a small round\r\nnodule, painful on pressure, gradually increases in size until death of the\r\ncentral portion takes place, then the surface of the skin gives way to\r\ninternal pressure and the core is released and expelled. Constitutional\r\nsymptoms are generally absent, unless the boils occur in considerable\r\nnumbers, or by their size involve a great deal of tissue.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Poulticing to ripen the abscess. If this can not be done,\r\napply camphorated oil two or three times a day until the core is formed. As\r\nsoon as the central or most prominent part becomes soft, the abscess should\r\nbe opened to release the core. Then use carbolized cosmoline once a day\r\nuntil the healing is completed. If the animal is in poor condition, give\r\ntonics--copperas, gentian, ginger, and sulphur, equal parts by weight, 1\r\ntablespoonful twice a day. If the animal manifests a feverish condition of\r\nthe system, give half an ounce of saltpeter twice a day, continuing it\r\nseveral days or a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAULTY SECRETIONS AND ABNORMAL GROWTHS OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nPITYRIASIS (SEBORRHEA, DANDRUFF, OR SCURF).\r\n\r\nThis is a condition characterized by an excessive secretion of sebaceous\r\nmatter, forming upon the skin in small crusts or scales.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--It is ascribable to a functional derangement of the sebaceous\r\nglands, usually accompanied with dryness and loss of pliancy of the skin.\r\nThe animal is hidebound, as it is commonly termed, thin in flesh, inclined\r\nto rub, and very frequently lousy. The condition is observed most often\r\ntoward the spring of the year. Animals that are continually housed, and the\r\nskins of which receive no cleaning, generally present a coat filled with\r\nfine scales, composed of epithelium from the epidermis and dried sebaceous\r\nmatter. This, however, is a physiological condition and compatible with\r\nperfect health.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Pityriasis may affect the greater portion of the body, though\r\nusually only certain parts are affected--the ears, neck, rump, etc. The\r\nskin becomes scurfy, the hairy coat filled with branlike gray or whitish\r\nscales.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Nutritious feed, such as oil-cake meal, bran, ground oats,\r\nand clean hay. In the spring the disease generally disappears after the\r\nanimal is turned out to pasture. When lice are present they should be\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEPHANTIASIS (SCLERODERMA).\r\n\r\nThis condition consists in a chronic thickening of the skin, which may\r\naffect one or more limbs or involve the whole integument. It is\r\ncharacterized by recurrent attacks of swelling of the skin and subcutaneous\r\nareolar tissue. After each attack the affected parts remain infiltrated to\r\na larger extent than before, until finally the skin may attain a thickness\r\nof an inch, becoming wrinkled and fissured. In cattle this disease is\r\nconfined to hot climates. The predisposing cause is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDEMA (ANASARCA OF THE SKIN).\r\n\r\nThis is a dropsical condition of the skin and subcutaneous areolar tissue,\r\ncharacterized by pitting under pressure, the fingers leaving a dent which\r\nremains a short time.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Edema generally results from a weakened state of the system\r\narising from previous disease. It may also be dependent upon a functional\r\nderangement of the kidneys, upon weak circulation, or obstruction to the\r\nflow of blood through the lungs. In debilitated animals and in some animals\r\nhighly infested with parasites there is swelling of the dewlap or of the\r\nfold of the skin between the jaws.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Painless swelling of a limb, udder, lower surface of abdomen,\r\nor lower jaw becomes apparent. This may increase in dimensions for several\r\ndays or may attain its maximum in less than 24 hours. Unless complicated\r\nwith some acute disease of a specific character, there is not much, if any,\r\nconstitutional disturbance. The deep layer of the skin is infiltrated with\r\nserum, which gives it the characteristic condition of pitting under\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the cause can be ascertained and removed we may expect\r\nto see the edema disappear. When no direct specific cause can be discovered\r\nand the animal is debilitated, give general tonic. If, on the contrary, it\r\nis in good flesh, give a purgative, followed by half an ounce of acetate of\r\npotassium twice a day. External applications are useless.\r\n\r\nEdema may be distinguished from erysipelas or anthrax by the absence of\r\npain and fever.\r\n\r\n\r\nDERMOID AND SEBACEOUS CYSTS (WENS).\r\n\r\nA dermoid cyst is formed by an involution of the skin with a growth of hair\r\non the inner wall of the sac. It may become embedded deeply in the\r\nsubcutaneous tissues or may just penetrate the thickness of the skin, where\r\nit is movable and painless. They are generally found within the ear or at\r\nits base, although they may form on any part of the body. Usually they have\r\na small opening, from which a thick, cheesy matter can be squeezed out. The\r\nrational treatment is to dissect them out.\r\n\r\nSebaceous cysts appear not unlike the former. They are formed by a\r\ndilatation of the hair follicle and sebaceous duct within the skin, and\r\ncontain a gray or yellowish sebaceous mass. The tumor may attain the size\r\nof a cherry stone or a walnut. Generally they are round, movable, and\r\npainless, soft or doughy in consistency, and covered with skin and hair.\r\nThey develop slowly. The best treatment is to dissect out the sac with\r\ncontents entire.\r\n\r\n\r\nVERRUCA (WARTS).\r\n\r\nCattle are affected with two varieties of warts. One, the verruca vulgaris,\r\nis composed of a cluster of enlarged papillÊ, covered with a thickened\r\nepidermis, the number of papillÊ determining the breadth and their length\r\nits height. They are generally circular in figure, slightly roughened on\r\nthe surface, and spring from the skin by a broad base. Occasionally large\r\nnumbers of very thin, long, pedunculated warts grow from the skin of the\r\near, lips, about the eyes, and vulva. Another variety, the verruca\r\nacuminata, sometimes erroneously denominated epithelial cancers, are\r\nirregularly shaped elevations, tufted or club shaped, occasionally existing\r\nas thick, short, fleshy excrescences, giving the growth the appearance of\r\ngranulation tissue. Their color is red or purplish, and oftentimes by\r\nfriction they become raw and bleeding, emitting then a very offensive odor.\r\nThey usually grow in clusters and their development is rapid.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--An abnormal nutrition of the skin, determined by increased\r\nenergy of growth operating upon a healthy skin; at other times, upon a weak\r\nor impoverished skin.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When they are small and pedunculated, they may be snipped off\r\nwith shears and the stump touched with nitrate of silver. When they are\r\nbroad and flattened, they may be dissected out and the wound cauterized if\r\nnecessary. If they are large and very vascular, they may be ligated, one by\r\none, by taking a strong cord and tying it as firmly around the base as\r\npossible. They will then shrivel, die, and drop off. If there is a tendency\r\nto grow again, apply a red-hot iron or nitric acid with a glass rod. Very\r\noften warts quickly disappear if they are kept soft by daily applications\r\nof sweet or olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nKELIS.\r\n\r\nKelis is an irregularly shaped flat tumor of the skin, resulting from\r\nhypertrophy--increased growth of the fibrous tissue of the corium,\r\nproducing absorption of the papillary layer.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--It may arise spontaneously or follow a scar after an injury.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Kelis generally appears below the knee or hock, and may occur\r\nsingly or in numbers. There are no constitutional symptoms. Its growth is\r\nvery slow and seldom causes any inconvenience. It appears as a flattened,\r\nirregular, or spreading growth within the substance of the skin, is hard to\r\nthe touch, and is especially characterized by divergent branches or roots,\r\nresembling the claws of a crab; hence the name. Occasionally some part of\r\nit may soften and result in an abscess. It may grow several inches in\r\nlength and encircle the whole limb.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--So long as it causes the animal no inconvenience it is best\r\nnot to meddle with it; when it does the animal ought to be fattened for\r\nbeef, the meat being perfectly harmless to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITIC DISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nRINGWORM (TINEA TONSURANS AND TINEA FAVOSA).\r\n\r\nRingworm is an affection of the skin, caused by a vegetable parasite.\r\n\r\nThe form known as tinea tonsurans is produced by the presence of a minute\r\nor microscopic fungus--the _Trichophyton tonsurans_, which affects the hair\r\nand the epidermic layer of the skin, and is highly contagious, being\r\nreadily transmitted from one animal to another. This fungus consists of\r\nspores and filaments. The spores, being the most numerous, are round and\r\nseldom vary much in size. They are very abundant in the hair follicle. The\r\nfilaments are articulated, waving, and contain granules. This disease is\r\nproductive of changes in the root and shaft of the hair, rendering it\r\nbrittle and easily broken off.\r\n\r\nThis disease becomes manifest by the formation of circular patches on the\r\nskin, which soon becomes denuded of hair. The cuticular layer of the skin\r\nin slightly inflamed, and vesication with exudation occurs, followed by the\r\nformation of scaly, brittle crusts. The patches appear silvery gray when\r\nincrusted, and are mostly confined to the head and neck. It is a common\r\ndisease among young cattle in the winter and spring. Very early in the\r\ndevelopment of the patches the hairs split, twist, and break off close to\r\nthe skin. This disease is attended with more or less itching. It is\r\ncommunicable to man.\r\n\r\nTinea favosa comes from another fungus, the _Achorion schˆnleinii._ This\r\nenters the hair follicle and involves the cuticle surrounding it, small\r\ncrusts form which increase in diameter and thickness and then become\r\nelevated at their margin, forming a cup-shaped scab, the favus cup, which\r\ngives the disease its distinctive character. The number of these cups\r\nvaries from a few to many hundreds. The hairs involved become brittle and\r\nbroken, fall off with the crusts, leaving small bald patches. The crusts\r\nare of a pale or sulphur-yellow color at first; as they grow older they\r\nturn darker, or to a brown color. This form of ringworm has a peculiar\r\nodor, resembling that of mice or musty straw. It is occasionally\r\ncommunicated to cattle by man, mice, cats, etc., all being subject to it.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Remove all crusts by washing with soap and water, then apply\r\nacetic acid, sulphur ointment, tincture of iodin or nitrate of mercury\r\nointment once a day. Cleanse the stable and whitewash it to destroy the\r\nspores scattered by the crusts.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PARASITES AND PARASITIC DISEASES OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\nFor discussion of mange, itch, scab, lousiness, warbles (grub in the skin),\r\nbuffalo gnats, hornfly (_Hoematobia serrata_), ticks, flies, etc., see the\r\nchapter on \"The animal parasites of cattle,\" page 502.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOUNDS OF THE SKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNAKE BITES AND VENOMOUS STINGS.\r\n\r\n[See discussion of these subjects in chapter on \"Poisons and poisoning.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nBURNS AND SCALDS.\r\n\r\nThis is a rare accident among cattle, yet in cases of fire it may occur.\r\nThe application of heat, whether dry or moist, unless sufficient instantly\r\nto destroy the life of a part, is always followed by the development of\r\nvesicles or blisters, which contain a thin, watery fluid. The blisters may\r\nbe isolated and not very large, or one blister may cover a very large\r\nsurface. When the burn is very severe the skin may be wholly devitalized,\r\nor the injury may extend into the deeper structures of the skin. Then\r\nsloughs will occur, followed by a contraction of the parts in healing; if\r\non a limb, this may render the animal stiff. When the burn or scald has\r\nbeen a severe one, the resulting pain is great and the constitutional\r\ndisturbance very marked.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--For a superficial burn use a mixture of equal parts of\r\nlimewater and linseed oil, or common white paint--white lead ground in\r\noil--to exclude the atmosphere and protect the inflamed skin. If it is not\r\nconvenient to get anything else, chimney soot, flour, or starch may be\r\nspread on the wound (dry), and covered with cotton batting and light\r\nbandage. The blisters should be opened to let the contained fluid escape,\r\nbut do not pull off the thin cuticle which has been raised by the blister.\r\nWhen the burn is extensive and deep sloughing occurs, the parts should be\r\ntreated, like other deep wounds, by poulticing, astringent washes, etc.\r\nWhen the system has sustained much shock, the animal may require internal\r\nstimulants, such as 2 drams of carbonate of ammonia every hour until it\r\nrallies. When the pain is very great, hypodermic injections of 6 grains of\r\nmorphia may be administered every six hours.\r\n\r\n_Frostbite_ on any portion of the body may be treated as recommended in the\r\narticle on diseases of the ears.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHYSEMA (AIR OR GAS UNDER THE SKIN).\r\n\r\nEmphysema of the skin is not a true disease of the skin, but it is\r\nmentioned as a pathological condition. It is characterized by a distention\r\nof the skin with air or gas contained in the subcutaneous areolar tissue.\r\nIt may depend upon a septic condition of the blood, as in anthrax or\r\nblackleg, or air may be forced under the skin about the head, neck, and\r\nshoulders, as a result of rupture of the windpipe. It occurs in the region\r\nof the chest and shoulders from penetrating wounds of the chest and lung,\r\nand occasionally follows puncture of the rumen when the escaping gas is\r\nretained under the skin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The skin is enormously distended over a greater or less\r\nportion of the body; thus any region of the body may lose its natural\r\ncontour and appear like a monstrosity. There is a peculiar crackling\r\nbeneath the skin when the hand is passed over it, and on tapping it with\r\nthe fingers a resonant, drumlike sound is elicited.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Puncture the distended skin with a clean, broad-bladed knife\r\nand press the air out. Further treatment must be directed with a view to\r\nthe removal of the cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE FOOT.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, D. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAMINITIS (FOUNDER).\r\n\r\nLaminitis denotes an active inflammation of the sensitive structures within\r\nthe wall of the hoof, which in severe cases may result in suppuration and\r\nthe loss of one or more claws. Owing to the simplicity of the structure of\r\nthe foot of an ox compared with that of the horse, this disease is rarely\r\nseen in an acute form, but a mild form, commonly called \"foot soreness,\" is\r\nnot of infrequent occurrence.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Laminitis in cattle may be caused by overfeeding, overheating,\r\ncontinued standing without exercise on a stone or cement floor without\r\nsufficient bedding, or by driving long distances over rough or stony soil.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--An unwillingness to maintain the standing position; the animal\r\npersists in lying down. The feet will be found unnaturally hot, and\r\nfrequently some swelling may be noticed above the hoof. Pressure upon the\r\nhoof with blacksmith's hoof pincers causes pain and flinching. The general\r\nbody temperature is increased and the breathing accelerated. Ordinarily the\r\nanimal eats and drinks as usual. When it is made to move excessive\r\ntenderness of the feet becomes manifest, as is shown by reluctance to walk\r\nand by the very short, hesitating step. Founder affects the hind as well as\r\nthe fore feet, although the front feet are more often exposed.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Cold packs to the feet, or if the animal can be made to stand\r\nin a stream of water, having a soft bottom, the inflammation is often\r\nrelieved without the necessity of any additional treatment. It may be well,\r\nhowever, to give a full dose of Epsom salt, 1 to 1-1/2 pounds, followed by\r\nhalf-ounce doses of saltpeter two or three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORENESS (FOOT SORENESS).\r\n\r\nCattle that have been stabled or pastured on soft ground and are driven\r\nover stony roads soon wear down the soles of their feet and become lame\r\nfrom foot soreness. Draft oxen, for this reason, require to be shod. When\r\nthe soreness is excessive it may develop into an active inflammation of all\r\nthe sensitive structures of the foot--laminitis, or into a local bruise\r\ncommonly called a \"corn.\"\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Rest, poulticing the feet with moistened clay, followed by\r\nastringent washes--strong white-oak bark or alum water.\r\n\r\nIf the pain and heat last several days, it is probable that pus has formed\r\nbeneath the wall of the hoof. In this case it is necessary to cut through\r\nthe wall, usually at the most prominent part of the sole, to allow the\r\naccumulation to drain out. The animal should then stand for several hours\r\ndaily in a tub containing a 3 per cent solution of some good milky coal-tar\r\ndisinfectant. When not in the disinfecting solution the foot should be\r\ndressed with pine tar and cotton and bandaged with bagging.\r\n\r\n\r\nLOSS OF HOOF.\r\n\r\nCattle sometimes become fastened between planks or otherwise and pull off\r\nthe wall of one or both claws in the effort to extricate themselves. The\r\nclaws of one or more feet may be shed as the result of acute laminitis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Wash the bleeding surface with an antiseptic and then with an\r\nastringent, such as a weak solution of alum, then apply a thick coating of\r\npine tar; cover this with a layer of oakum or absorbent cotton; apply\r\nanother coat of tar over this, and then bandage closely and firmly. This\r\nmay remain without disturbance until the new growing wall becomes\r\nsufficiently strong to sustain the pressure and weight of the animal. If,\r\nhowever, at any time oozing or bad smell indicates that pus is forming\r\nunder this dressing, the bandage should be removed and the suppurating\r\nsurface freshly cleaned and dressed. This may have to be repeated every few\r\ndays and should be continued so long as there is any pus formation. If the\r\nloss of hoof is owing to suppurative laminitis, the parts denuded of the\r\nhorny covering must be thoroughly cleansed and disinfected with carbolic\r\nacid, lysol, or other antiseptic. Then apply a moderately thick layer of\r\nabsorbent cotton and over this apply the tar and bandage. After this the\r\nantiseptic solution may be poured in daily at the top of the dressing. It\r\nwill thus soak in and saturate the dressing and inflamed tissue. It may\r\nbecome necessary to remove all the dressing at daily or longer intervals to\r\ngive the parts a fresh cleaning, and then to reapply it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL IN FOOT (FOOT ROT).\r\n\r\nA variety of causes may produce inflammation of the foot between the claws\r\nor toes. It may be on account of overgrowth of the claws and inward\r\npressure, as in ingrowing nail of man, or it may be caused by the\r\nirritation of stable filth by impaction and hardening of soil between the\r\nclaws, or by other foreign substances becoming wedged in, causing\r\ninflammation and softening or ulceration of the skin in the interdigital\r\nspace. Under some conditions several cattle in the same herd become\r\naffected, which has led some to think that the disease may be contagious.\r\nOccurrences have been reported in which foot rot of cattle has appeared\r\nwithin a short time among a large proportion of the cattle in a farming\r\ndistrict. This disease is most frequently seen in the hind feet, though all\r\nfour feet may become affected.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal is observed to limp. On examination of the foot we\r\ndiscover heat and swelling above the hoof and of the soft parts between the\r\nclaws which frequently spreads the claws apart to a considerable extent, or\r\nthe inflammation may have advanced to softening and sloughing of the\r\ninterdigital membrane. If the disease is neglected at this stage, deep\r\nabscesses may form and the pus burrow under the horny wall, or the joint\r\nwithin the hoof may become inflamed and the articular attachments\r\ndestroyed, in which case the treatment will be difficult and recovery will\r\nbe very tedious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In the earlier stages of the disease, before pus burrows\r\nbeneath the horn, a thorough cleansing and an application of a\r\ncarbolic-acid solution--1 ounce to a pint of water--clean stabling,\r\nand laxative food will usually remedy the evil. Compound solution of\r\ncresol is an excellent remedy at this stage. It should be applied, in\r\nits pure or undiluted state, to the suppurating and putrefying tissue\r\nbetween the claws. It is best applied by means of a cotton swab on a\r\nthin stick. Care must be taken to keep it from contact with the skin\r\nabout the coronary band or heels. If deep sloughing has taken place the\r\ncarbolic solution should be used, and a wad of oakum or cotton smeared\r\nwith pine tar should be secured firmly in the cleft. This can be done\r\nby taking a strip of strong cloth, 2 inches wide, passing the middle\r\nbetween the claws, then tying the ends after winding them in opposite\r\ndirections above the hoof. Sometimes warm poulticing with flaxseed meal\r\nor bran is necessary to relieve excessive fever and pain. If the pus\r\nburrows under the horn, its channel must be followed by paring away the\r\nhorn until the bottom is reached. The aftertreatment is the same as that\r\nalready recommended. If the joint becomes diseased an amputation of that\r\ntoe is the quickest and surest method to relieve the suffering of the\r\nanimal, and offers the best chance for an early recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERATION OF THE HEEL.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we find ulcers at the junction of the hair with the hoof at\r\nthe heel, which present an elevated, raw, or ragged surface, and cause\r\nconsiderable lameness. This is generally caused by a bruise of the fibrous\r\ncushion of the back part of the foot. Subsequent sloughing or necrosis may\r\noccur, or pus may form deep within the wall and gain an exit at the margin\r\nof the heel. Sometimes, from no visible cause, large pieces of skin slough\r\nfrom the heel and pastern. This condition is caused by an infection with\r\ncertain microorganisms (streptococci, necrosis bacilli) and may be\r\ncontagious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If there is a deep opening, inject carbolic solution once a\r\nday until it closes. If the ulcer is only superficial, wash with carbolic\r\nsolution and apply a mixture of equal parts of blue vitriol and alum in dry\r\npowder.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISSURE OF THE WALL (SPLIT HOOF).\r\n\r\nThis is rarely seen among cattle. It may occur in weak walls, in heavily\r\nbodied cattle, caused by stepping on an uneven surface, especially when the\r\npoint of the toe is grown out long. One may find the point of the toe\r\nbroken and the wall split almost up to the hair.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The divided sections may be brought into approximation and\r\nheld in place by drilling a small hole from one side into and through the\r\nother, commencing half an inch back of the fissure on each side; then drive\r\na light horseshoe nail through the hole and clinch it.   Pare the injured\r\nclaw as short as it will bear.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERDIGITAL FIBROMA.\r\n\r\nHard, nodular, fibrous tumors sometimes grow in the cleft of the foot, and\r\ncause inconvenience, lameness, absorption, or ulceration of the contiguous\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--They should be dissected out and the wound dressed with\r\ncarbolic-acid lotion and pine tar once a day until healing is completed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFORMITIES.\r\n\r\nDeformities in the feet of cattle usually consist in overgrowth of horn,\r\ngenerally from want of wear in animals which are stabled. The hoof may turn\r\ninward, outward, or upward, and may give rise to lameness, inability to\r\nwalk, foul foot, etc. Bulls which are continually stabled and dairy cows\r\nvery frequently have misshapen feet from want of an occasional trimming,\r\nand this deformity may eventually lead to permanent injury.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Cut the superabundant growth of horn down with saw, knife, or\r\nrasp, until the foot assumes its natural form.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICKS AND WOUNDS.\r\n\r\nIf an animal suffers with a penetrating wound from prick of fork or nail,\r\nthe orifice of the wound should be enlarged to permit a free discharge of\r\npus; then the foot should be soaked in a cresol compound solution (3 per\r\ncent) in a tub, or a flaxseed poultice applied, changing it three times a\r\nday until the fever has abated. The foot should be kept bandaged and\r\ndressed with pine tar and oakum; the animal must also be kept on a clean\r\nfloor until the wound is closed and all or nearly all lameness has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIf an animal is cut in the foot with barbed wire, piece of glass, or any\r\nother substance, the wound, after proper cleansing, should be dressed with\r\ncarbolic-acid solution, 1 ounce of the acid to 20 of water. If any uneven\r\nedges of horn, skin, or lacerated flesh project, trim them off, and in all\r\ncases when it can be done a tarred bandage should be applied. This will\r\nserve to sustain the cut surfaces in their place, exclude dirt, and protect\r\nagainst flies, maggots, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen the wound has extended into a joint, surgical treatment, which will\r\nrequire the services of an educated veterinarian, may be necessary.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an animal gets caught by the foot in a crevice and sustains\r\nsevere bruising, wrenching, or fracture of some part of the foot. In such\r\ncases cold-water packs to the injured member are of service until the fever\r\nand swelling disappear. Afterwards the animal should rest until the\r\nusefulness of the foot is restored. Sometimes such an accident, causing\r\nfracture, renders necessary plaster bandages or amputation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EYE AND ITS APPENDAGES.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, D. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of gaining a clear comprehension of the diseases of the eye it\r\nbecomes necessary to review the anatomy of this important organ. The\r\nessential organ of vision, or globe of the eye, will be first described,\r\nthen its receptacle or orbital cavity, the muscles that move it, the\r\nprotective membranes, or eyelids, the membrana nictitans, or accessory\r\neyelids, and, lastly, the lacrimal apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe globe or ball of the eye is almost spherical in form. On closer\r\ninspection, however, it appears to be made up of two combined portions from\r\nspheres of different sizes. The posterior portion, forming about\r\nfive-sixths of the ball, is a sphere of comparatively large size with a\r\nsmall segment cut off it in front, and at this point there is applied to it\r\nthe anterior portion, which, being a segment of a smaller sphere, projects\r\nat the front of the ball with a greater convexity than the posterior\r\nportion.\r\n\r\nThe eyeball consists of concentrically arranged coats and of refracting\r\nmedia inclosed in them. The coats are three in number, namely, (1) an\r\nexternal protective tunic made up of the sclerotic and cornea; (2) a middle\r\nvascular and pigmentary tunic, the choroid; (3) an internal nervous layer,\r\nthe retina. The sclerotic is the white, opaque part of the outer tunic, of\r\nwhich it forms about the posterior five-sixths, being coextensive with the\r\nlarger sphere already mentioned. The cornea forms the remaining one-sixth\r\nof the outer tunic, being coextensive with the segment of the smaller\r\nsphere. It is distinguished from the sclerotic by being colorless and\r\ntransparent. The choroid coat will be recognized as the black layer lying\r\nsubjacent to the sclerotic. It does not line the cornea, but terminates\r\nbehind the line of junction of that coat with the sclerotic by a thickened\r\nedge--the ciliary processes. At the line of junction of the sclerotic and\r\ncornea the iris passes across the interior of the eye. This (which may be\r\nviewed as a dependency of the choroid) is a muscular curtain perforated by\r\nan aperture termed the pupil. The retina will be recognized as a delicate,\r\nglassy layer, lining the greater part of the choroid.\r\n\r\nThe refracting media of the eye are three in number, namely (1) the aqueous\r\nhumor, a watery fluid inclosed in a chamber behind the cornea; (2) the\r\ncrystalline lens and its capsule, a transparent, soft solid of a biconvex\r\nform, and placed behind the iris; (3) the vitreous humor, a transparent\r\nmaterial with a consistence like thin jelly, and occupying as much of the\r\ninterior of the eye as is subjacent to the choroid.\r\n\r\nThe sclerotic is a strong, opaque, fibrous membrane, which, in a great\r\nmeasure, maintains the form of the eyeball and protects the more delicate\r\nstructures within it. Its interior portion, which is covered by the ocular\r\nconjunctiva, is commonly known as the \"white of the eye.\" In form it is\r\nbell-shaped, and the optic nerve pierces it behind like a handle, the\r\nperforation being a little to its inner side. In front, the rim of the bell\r\nbecomes continuous with the cornea. The outer surface of the membrane\r\nreceives the insertion of the muscles of the eyeball. The coat is thickest\r\nover the posterior part of the eyeball, and is thinnest a little behind its\r\njunction with the cornea.\r\n\r\nThe cornea is the anterior transparent portion of the outer coat of the\r\neyeball. It may be viewed as a part of the sclerotic specially modified to\r\npermit the passage of light into the interior of the eye. Its outline is\r\nelliptical, nearly circular, and its greatest diameter is transverse. At\r\nits periphery it joins the sclerotic by continuity of tissue, and as the\r\nedge of the cornea is slightly beveled and has the fibrous sclerotic\r\ncarried for a little distance forward on its outward surface, the cornea is\r\ngenerally said to be fitted into the sclerotic like a watch glass into its\r\nrim. The venous canal of Schlemm runs circularly around the eyeball at the\r\nline of junction of the sclerotic and cornea. The anterior surface of the\r\ncornea is exquisitely smooth, and is kept moist by the lacrimal secretions.\r\nIts posterior surface forms the anterior boundary of the chamber in which\r\nthe aqueous humor is contained. The cornea is of uniform thickness and is\r\nof a dense, almost horny, consistence. Save a few capillary loops of blood\r\nvessels at its margin the cornea is without vessels. Its structure is\r\ncomprised of five distinct layers.\r\n\r\nThe aqueous humor occupies a chamber which is bounded in front by the\r\nposterior surface of the cornea and behind by the capsule and suspensory\r\nligament of the lens and by the ends of the ciliary processes. It is across\r\nthis chamber that the iris extends. The aqueous humor is composed of water,\r\nwith a small proportion of common salt in solution.\r\n\r\nThe iris is a muscular, pigmented curtain extending across the interior of\r\nthe eye and having about its center an aperture termed the pupil. By\r\nvariations in the size of this aperture the amount of light transmitted to\r\nthe retina is regulated. It varies somewhat in color, but is most\r\nfrequently of a yellowish-brown tint. Its anterior face is bathed by the\r\naqueous humor. The greater part of the posterior surface is in contact with\r\nthe capsule of the lens and glides on it during the movements of the\r\ncurtain. The circumferential border is attached within the junction of the\r\nsclerotic cornea. The inner border circumscribes the pupil, which varies in\r\noutline according to its size. When much contracted the pupil is a very\r\nelongated ellipse, the long axis of which is in the line joining the nasal\r\nand temporal angles of the eyelids. It contains muscular tissue, which, by\r\ncontracting or relaxing, lessens or dilates the pupillary opening.\r\n\r\nThe choroid coat is a bell-shaped, dark membrane which lines the sclerotic.\r\nIts outer surface has a shaggy appearance, caused by the tunica fusca,\r\nwhich unites the two coats. Between the two the ciliary vessels and nerves\r\npass forward. Behind it is pierced by the optic nerve; in front it is\r\ncontinued as the ciliary processes, which form, as it were, the rim of the\r\nbell. The ciliary processes form a fringe around the slightly inverted rim\r\nof the choroid.\r\n\r\nThe retina is the most delicate of the coats of the eyeball. It is formed\r\nby the expansion of the optic nerve on the inner surface of the choroid,\r\nand, like that coat, it is bell-shaped. Its inner surface is molded on the\r\nvitreous humor. The nervous structures of the retina terminate at a wavy\r\nline, the ora serrata, behind the ciliary processes. Ten distinct layers\r\nare described as composing the thickness of the retina.\r\n\r\nThe lens is situated behind the pupil and is contained within a capsule of\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nThe capsule is a close-fitting, firm, transparent membrane. The anterior\r\nsurface forms the posterior boundary of the cavity containing the aqueous\r\nhumor, and the iris in its movement glides on it. The posterior surface is\r\nin contact with the vitreous humor.\r\n\r\nThe vitreous humor occupies four-fifths of the interior of the eyeball. It\r\nis globular in form, with a depression in front for the lodgment of the\r\nlens. It is colorless, transparent, and of a consistency like thin jelly.\r\nIt is enveloped by a delicate capsule--the hyaloid membrane--which is\r\nconnected in front with the suspensory ligament of the lens, and ends by\r\njoining the capsule behind the lens.\r\n\r\nThe orbital cavity, at the side of the head, is circumscribed by a bony\r\nmargin; posteriorly, however, there are no bony walls, and the cavity is\r\noften confounded with the depression above and behind the orbit--the\r\ntemporal fossa. A fibrous membrane completes this cavity and keeps it\r\ndistinct from the temporal fossa. This membrane--the ocular sheath or\r\nperiorbita--is attached posteriorly around the opening in the back part of\r\nthe orbital cavity (the orbital hiatus) and anteriorly to its inner face;\r\nthen it becomes prolonged beyond the margin to form the fibrous membrane of\r\nthe eyelids. When complete the orbital cavity has the form of a regular\r\nhollow cone, open at its base and closed at the apex. The opening of this\r\ncone is directed forward, downward, and outward. Independently of the globe\r\nof the eye, this cavity lodges the muscles that move it, the membrana\r\nnictitans, and the lacrimal gland.\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the eye are seven in number--one retractor, four straight,\r\nand two oblique. The retractor oculi envelops the optic nerve between the\r\nbrain and the ball of the eye and becomes attached upon the external face\r\nof the sclerotic tunic. When this muscle contracts, it draws the globe back\r\ninto the orbit, away from the light. The superior, inferior, external, and\r\ninternal recti or straight muscles are attached to the back part of the\r\norbital sheath and spread forward in four bundles over the globe of the\r\neye, where they are inserted by a fibrous expansion into the sclerotic at\r\nthe margin of the cornea. When they act singly, they turn the globe either\r\nupward, downward, inward, or outward. The great oblique, by its action,\r\npivots the eye inward and upward in the orbit. The small oblique turns the\r\neye outward and downward.\r\n\r\nThe eyelids are two movable curtains, superior and inferior, which cover\r\nand protect the eye in front. They are attached to the circumference of the\r\norbit and have a convex external face formed by the skin and a concave\r\ninternal face molded on the anterior surface of the eye and are lined by\r\nthe conjunctiva, which is reflected above and below on the eyeball. The\r\nborder of each lid is slightly beveled on the inner side and shows the\r\nopenings of the Meibomian glands. These glands secrete an unctuous fluid,\r\nwhich is thrown out on the border of the lids, the function of which is to\r\nfacilitate their movements and enable them to retain the tears in the\r\nocular cavity. The eyelid is composed of a fibrous inner membrane ending in\r\na stiff arch near the border, a muscle to close the lid, another to open\r\nit, the skin externally, and the conjunctival mucous membrane internally.\r\nThe border of each lid is covered and protected by long hairs to prevent\r\nfloating particles of matter in the atmosphere from gaining entrance to the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nThe membrana nictitans, which is also named the third eyelid, winking\r\neyelid, haw, etc., is placed at the inner angle of the eye, whence it\r\nextends over the eyeball to relieve it from foreign bodies which may fall\r\nupon it. It has for its framework a fibro-cartilage, irregular in shape,\r\nthick, nearly prismatic at its base, and thin anteriorly where it is\r\ncovered by the conjunctiva; behind, it is loosely attached to a fatty\r\ncushion.\r\n\r\nThe lacrimal gland is situated between the orbital process and the upper\r\npart of the eyeball. It secretes the tears destined to lubricate the\r\nanterior surface of the eye. This fluid escapes upon the organ at the outer\r\nangle of the lids and is carried between them and the eyeball toward the\r\ninner angle.\r\n\r\nThe caruncula lacrimalis is a small round body, frequently entirely or\r\npartially black, situated in the inner angle of the eye, and is designed to\r\ndirect the tears toward the puncta lacrimalia.\r\n\r\nThe puncta lacrimalia are two little openings, situated one in each eyelid,\r\na short distance from the inner corner, which admit the tears into the\r\nlacrimal ducts leading to the lacrimal canal, whence they are emptied into\r\nthe nasal passages.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONJUNCTIVITIS (SIMPLE OPHTHALMIA).\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the conjunctival mucous membrane of the eyeball\r\nand lids; in severe cases the deeper coats of the eye are involved,\r\nseriously complicating the attack.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--It may result from a bruise of the eyelid; from the introduction\r\nof foreign matters into the eye, as chaff, hayseed, dust, gnats, etc.; from\r\nexposure to cold; poisonous or irritating vapors arising from filthiness of\r\nstable. Dust, cinders, or sand blown into the eyes during transportation\r\nfrequently cause conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--A profuse flow of tears, closure of the eyelids from\r\nintolerance of light, retraction of the eyeball and corresponding\r\nprotrusion of the haw, disinclination to move, diminution of milk\r\nsecretion, etc. On parting the lids the lining membrane is found injected\r\nwith an excess of blood, giving it a red and swollen appearance; the\r\nsclerotic, or white of the eye, is bloodshot and the cornea may be cloudy.\r\nIf the disease advances, keratitis results, with its train of unfavorable\r\nsymptoms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Careful examination should be made to discover particles of\r\nchaff, etc., which may have lodged in the eye, and upon the discovery of\r\nsuch a cause prompt removal is indicated. This may be accomplished by\r\nflushing the eye with warm water by means of a syringe, or, if the foreign\r\nsubstance is adherent to the eyeball or lid, it may be scooped out with the\r\nhandle of a teaspoon or some other blunt instrument. To relieve the\r\ncongestion and local irritation, a wash composed of boracic acid in freshly\r\nboiled water, 20 grains to the ounce, or acetate of zinc, 5 grains to the\r\nounce of pure soft water, may be used, to which may be added 20 drops of\r\nlaudanum. A few drops of this should be placed in the eye with a\r\ncamel's-hair pencil or soft feather three or four times daily. The animal\r\nshould be placed in a cool, darkened stable; then a cloth folded into\r\nseveral thicknesses should be fastened to the horns in such manner as to\r\nreach below the eyes. This should be kept wet with cold water during the\r\nday and removed at night. If there is much fever and constitutional\r\ndisturbance, it becomes advisable to administer 1 pound of Epsom salt\r\ndissolved in 1 quart of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS CATARRHAL CONJUNCTIVITIS (SPECIFIC\r\nOPHTHALMIA).\r\n\r\nThis generally appears in an enzootic or epizootic form and affects a\r\nconsiderable number in the herd. It is distinctly a contagious disease and\r\nmay be brought into a previously healthy herd by one infected animal. It\r\nmay continue in a herd for a season or for several years, affecting all\r\nnewly purchased animals. It is seldom seen in the winter months. It affects\r\nold and young animals alike.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--This form of catarrh conjunctivitis is characterized chiefly\r\nby a mucopurulent discharge from the eyes, an intense degree of\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane, accompanied with swelling of the\r\neyelids and an early opacity of the cornea. The flow of tears is mixed with\r\npus, sometimes streaked with blood, and the skin of the face is kept moist\r\nand soiled. The eyes are kept continually closed. The implication of the\r\ncornea in the disease frequently blinds the animal for a time, and\r\noccasionally suppurative keratitis, ulcers of the cornea, or staphyloma\r\nsupervene. The attack is marked from the onset by fever, partial loss of\r\nappetite, partial loss of milk, suspended rumination, and separation from\r\nthe herd.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The animal should be housed in a cool, dark stable, supplied\r\nwith plenty of fresh water to drink and soft, succulent feed. Administer 1\r\npound of Epsom salt--if a very large animal, use 1-1/2 pounds--dissolved in\r\n2 or 3 pints of water. For an eyewash, take boracic acid, 1 dram, and pour\r\n4 ounces of boiling water over it. Use this as often as is convenient,\r\napplying it directly to the eye. In the majority of cases improvement\r\nbecomes manifest in a few days, and the eye becomes clear and free from\r\ninflammation in 10 days or 2 weeks. Where the disease develops ulceration\r\nof the cornea, or well-marked, deep-seated keratitis, the treatment\r\nrecommended for those conditions should be adopted.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Whenever this affection appears in a herd all the unaffected\r\nanimals should be moved to fields which possess a different character of\r\nsoil and feed. The water should also be changed, especially if they have\r\nbeen obtaining it from a stagnant pond.\r\n\r\n\r\nKERATITIS (CORNEITIS).\r\n\r\nThis is an inflammation of the cornea proper, although the sclerotic at the\r\ncorneal border becomes involved to some extent. It may be divided into\r\ndiffuse and suppurative.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--The cornea constitutes the most prominent portion of the\r\neyeball, hence it is subject to a variety of injuries--scratches, pricks,\r\ncontusions, lacerations, etc. Inflammation of the cornea may also be due to\r\nthe extension of catarrhal conjunctivitis or intraocular disease, and it\r\nmay occasionally occur without any perceptible cause.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Diffuse keratitis is characterized by an exudation into and an\r\nopacity of the cornea. The swelling of the anterior part of the eyeball may\r\nbe of an irregular form, in points resembling small bladders, or it may\r\ncommence at the periphery of the cornea by an abrupt thickening, which\r\ngradually diminishes as it approaches the center. If the whole cornea is\r\naffected, it has a uniform gray or grayish-white appearance. The flow of\r\ntears is not so marked as in conjunctivitis, nor is the suffering so acute,\r\nthough both conditions often exist together. Both eyes usually become\r\naffected, unless it is caused by an external injury.\r\n\r\nIn favorable cases the exudate within the cornea begins to disappear within\r\na week or 10 days, the eye becomes clearer and regains its transparency,\r\nuntil it eventually is fully restored. In unfavorable cases blood vessels\r\nform and are seen to traverse the affected part from periphery to center,\r\nvision becomes entirely lost, and permanent opacity (albugo or leucoma)\r\nremains. When it arises from constitutional causes recurrence is frequent,\r\nleaving the corneal membrane more cloudy after each attack, until the sight\r\nis permanently lost.\r\n\r\nSuppurative keratitis may be a sequel of diffuse keratitis; more commonly,\r\nhowever, it abruptly becomes manifest by a raised swelling on or near the\r\ncenter of the cornea that very soon assumes a yellow, turbid color, while\r\nthe periphery of the swelling fades into an opaque ring. Suppurative\r\nkeratitis is seldom noticed for the first day or two--not until distinct\r\npus formation has occurred. When it is the result of diffuse keratitis,\r\nulceration and the escape of the contained pus is inevitable; otherwise the\r\npus may be absorbed. When the deeper membranes covering the anterior\r\nchamber of the eye become involved, the contents of this chamber may be\r\nevacuated and the sight permanently lost.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Place the animal in a darkened stable, give green or sloppy\r\nfeed, and administer 4 ounces of Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda)\r\ndissolved in a quart of water once a day. If the animal is debilitated a\r\ntablespoonful of tonic powder should be mixed with the feed three times a\r\nday. This may be composed of equal parts by weight of powdered copperas\r\n(sulphate of iron), gentian, and ginger. As an application for the eye,\r\nnitrate of silver, 3 grains to the ounce of soft water, with the addition\r\nof 1 grain sulphate of morphia, may be used several times a day. If\r\nulceration occurs, it is well to dust powdered calomel into the eye twice\r\ndaily, or apply to the eyelids a salve of yellow oxid of mercury, 5 per\r\ncent in lanolin. Some of this may go on to the cornea and beneath the lids.\r\nApply twice daily. (See \"Ulcers of the cornea.\")\r\n\r\nTo remove opacity, after the inflammation has subsided, apply a few drops\r\nof the following solution twice a day: Iodid of potassium, 15 grains;\r\ntincture sanguinaria, 20 drops; distilled water, 2 ounces; mix.\r\n\r\nSometimes keratitis exists in a herd as a transmissible disease, spreading\r\nlike infectious conjunctivitis. Calomel, applied to the eye, is especially\r\nuseful in such cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nULCERS OF THE CORNEA.\r\n\r\nAn ulcer comes from erosion or is the consequence of the bursting of a\r\nsmall abscess, which may have formed beneath the delicate layer of the\r\nconjunctiva, continued over the cornea; or, in the very substance of the\r\ncornea itself, after violent keratitis, or catarrhal conjunctivitis. At\r\nother times it is produced by bruises, scratches, or other direct injury of\r\nthe cornea.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The ulcer is generally at first of a pale gray color, with its\r\nedges high and irregular, discharges instead of pus an acrid, watery\r\nsubstance, and has a tendency to spread widely and deeply. If it spreads\r\nsuperficially upon the cornea, the transparency of this membrane is lost;\r\nif it proceeds deeply and penetrates the anterior chamber of the aqueous\r\nhumor, this fluid escapes, the iris may prolapse, and the lens and the\r\nvitreous humor become expelled, thus producing destruction of the whole\r\norgan.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--It is of the greatest importance, as soon as an ulcer appears\r\nupon the cornea, to prevent its growing larger. The corroding process must\r\nbe converted into a healthy one. For this purpose nothing is more reliable\r\nthan the use of solid nitrate of silver. A stick of this medicine should be\r\nscraped to a point; the animal's head should be firmly secured; an\r\nassistant should part the lids; if necessary, the haw must be secured\r\nwithin the corner of the eye and then all parts of the ulcer should be\r\nlightly touched with the silver. After waiting a few minutes the eye should\r\nbe thoroughly washed out with a very weak solution of common salt. This\r\noperation generally has to be repeated at the end of three or four days. If\r\nhealthy action succeeds, the ulcer assumes a delicate fleshy tint, and the\r\nformer redness around the ulcer disappears in proportion as the ulcer\r\nheals.\r\n\r\nIn superficial abrasions of the cornea, where there is no distinct\r\nexcavation, this caustic treatment is not needed. The eye should be bathed\r\nseveral times a day with sulphate of zinc, 30 grains to half a pint of soft\r\nwater, and protected against exposure to cold air and sunlight. Excessive\r\nulceration sometimes assumes the form of fungous excrescence upon the\r\ncornea, appearing to derive its nourishment from loops of blood vessels of\r\nthe conjunctiva. Under these circumstances the fungoid mass must be cut\r\naway and the wound cauterized with the nitrate of silver, or else the eye\r\nwill soon be destroyed. When ulcers of the cornea appear indolent, with a\r\ntendency to slough, in addition to the treatment already prescribed, tonic\r\npowders of copperas, gentian, and ginger, equal parts by weight, should be\r\ngiven twice a day, mixed with the feed; dose, one tablespoonful.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAPHYLOMA.\r\n\r\nThis is a disease of the eyeball, in which the cornea loses its\r\ntransparency, rises above the level of the eye, and even projects beyond\r\nthe eyelids in the form of an elongated, whitish, or pearl-colored tumor,\r\nwhich is sometimes smooth, at other times uneven.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Inflammation is the only known cause, although it may not occur\r\nimmediately; it frequently follows catarrhal conjunctivitis and keratitis\r\nas a sequela.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In a few cases restoration of sight may be effected by\r\npuncturing the projecting tumor and treating it afterwards with nitrate of\r\nsilver in the same manner as prescribed for ulceration of the cornea. In\r\nsome cases spontaneous rupture has occurred, and healing without any\r\ntreatment at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATARACT.\r\n\r\nIn cataract the crystalline lens becomes opaque and loses its transparency,\r\nthe power of refraction is lost--the animal can not see.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Cataract generally arises from a diminution (atrophy) or other\r\nchange in the nutrition of the lens; it may occur as a result of\r\ninflammation of the deep structures of the eye. Cataract may be simple, or\r\ncomplicated with amaurosis, adhesions, etc.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--It is known by the whiteness or loss of transparency of the\r\nlens, although the pupil dilates and contracts. Sight may be totally lost;\r\nhowever, evidence is usually manifested that the animal distinguishes light\r\nwhen brought out of a darkened stable. For the most part the formation of\r\ncataract takes place slowly, the cases in which it originates very quickly\r\nbeing but few.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--There is only one method for the treatment of cataract--a\r\nsurgical operation for the removal of the lens; but this is not advisable,\r\nfor the sight can not be perfectly restored, and objects would be seen\r\nimperfectly without the aid of glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMAUROSIS.\r\n\r\nThis is a paralysis of the nerve of sight or the expansion of the retina.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--This is the result of concussion from a blow upon the forehead,\r\nfracture of bone over the eye (causing downward pressure), rheumatic\r\ninflammation of the optic nerve, or from extension of deep inflammation of\r\nthe eye involving the retina. It sometimes occurs as the result of\r\nexcessive loss of blood or of great debility.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In this disease observation is seldom made until the animal in\r\nits gait and by its action indicates blindness. Generally both eyes are\r\naffected. The eyeball remains clear, and the pupil is permanently dilated.\r\nNo response to light is manifested.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If caused by debility, loss of blood, or associated with\r\nrheumatism, general blood tonics may be given in the feed, namely, powdered\r\nsulphate of iron, 1 dram; gentian, 2 drams; nux vomica, one-half dram; to\r\nbe given twice a day. In cases of rheumatism, one-half ounce of saltpeter\r\nmay be added.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILARIA OCULI (WORM IN THE EYE).\r\n\r\n_Filaria oculi_ (provisionally taken as the larva of _F. cervina_) is a\r\nsmall white worm, found swimming in the aqueous fluid in the anterior\r\nchamber. It may be apparently harmless for a long time, but will eventually\r\ninduce keratitis with inflammatory exudations.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The cornea may be punctured at its upper and outer margin,\r\nand the worm squeezed out with the aqueous humor. The latter will be formed\r\nagain. This operation results disastrously unless the greatest care and\r\nskill are employed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORNEAL DERMATOMA (HAIRY TUMOR ON THE EYEBALL).\r\n\r\nIn a few instances this has been seen as a congenital growth. The tumor\r\narises from the cornea or the sclerotic, covered by its respective\r\nmembrane, with a growth of hair upon its surface. These tumors may be quite\r\nprominent or flattened, and are dark in color; the hair may protrude\r\nbetween the eyelids, giving the animal the appearance of having a double\r\neyelid.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A surgical operation becomes necessary for their removal--\r\none requiring a skilled operator.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRABISMUS (SQUINTING).\r\n\r\nThis is a very rare affection among cattle. Strabismus may be either single\r\nor double--affecting one eye or both. It is caused by a paralysis, or a\r\nweakening of one of the straight muscles of the eyeball. Generally it is a\r\ncongenital defect, and the squinting is toward the nose--strabismus\r\nconvergens. It is best not to attempt to remedy the defect, as the risk in\r\nan operation is greater than the chances of success warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nPTERYGIUM.\r\n\r\nThis term is applied to a flesh-colored membrane, triangular in form, which\r\nmost frequently grows from the inner angle of the eye and extends over the\r\ncornea, thus interfering with vision. It may grow from the outer angle, or\r\neven from either the superior or inferior hemisphere of the eyeball. The\r\nfigure is invariably that of a triangle, with its base on the white of the\r\neye and its apex more or less advanced over the cornea toward its center.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characteristics are the constancy of the triangular\r\nform, and the facility with which the whole of it may be taken hold of with\r\na pair of forceps and raised into a fold on the cornea. Every other kind of\r\nexcrescence attached to this membrane continues firmly adherent to it, and\r\ncan not be folded and raised from the surface of the cornea in any manner\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Raise the fold and dissect it away from all points of\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRICHIASIS (INVERSION OF THE EYELASHES).\r\n\r\nIn the simplest form the eyelashes bend inwardly, touching the eyeball,\r\ncausing irritation and simple conjunctivitis. It may be also associated\r\nwith entropion.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The offending eyelashes should be cut off or pulled out. In\r\ncase the natural growth of the eyelashes is directed inward, an operation\r\nsimilar to that for entropion becomes necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nENTROPION (INVERSION OF THE EYELID).\r\n\r\nIn inversion of the eyelid the eyelashes soon irritate the anterior face of\r\nthe cornea and produce more or less inflammation and opacity. The inversion\r\nmay be due to the growth of a tumor within or without the lid, to abscess,\r\nlaceration, or injury, causing the lid to lose its natural conformity to\r\nthe eyeball, ulcerations, etc. Surgical interference in either case becomes\r\nnecessary to restore the lid to its natural direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nECTROPION (EVERSION OF THE EYELID).\r\n\r\nThis serves to injure the eye by permitting dust or other foreign\r\nsubstances to enter the eye and interferes with the natural removal of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A delicate surgical operation--the removal of an elliptic\r\nsection of the palpÊbral conjunctiva--may remedy the defect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE EYELIDS.\r\n\r\nOccasionally tumors form upon or within the substance of the eyelid. They\r\nmay be of a fibroid nature and arise from the follicles of the hair as\r\nsebaceous tumors or may be in the form of an abscess. In debilitating\r\ndiseases the lids sometimes become swollen and puffy, a condition which may\r\npossibly be taken for the growth of a tumor. This generally disappears with\r\nthe improvement of the health of the animal. Warts not uncommonly appear on\r\nor about the eyelids of cattle.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The removal of a tumor in the vicinity of so delicate an\r\norgan as the eye should not be attempted by anyone not qualified to perform\r\nthe operation.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACERATION OF THE EYELID.\r\n\r\nThis accident is not uncommon where cattle are fenced in by barbed wire; an\r\nanimal may be caught under the eyelid by the horn of another, or the\r\nlaceration may occur in the stable by means of a projecting nail or\r\nsplinter of wood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The edges of the wound should be brought together closely and\r\ncorrectly, by means of pins pushed through very nearly the whole thickness\r\nof the lid, extending through each lip of the torn part; then a waxed silk\r\nor linen thread must be wound over each end of the pin, crossing the torn\r\nline in the form of the figure 8 (Pl. XXVII, fig. 9); the pins should be\r\nplaced about three-eighths of an inch apart. The projecting ends of the\r\npins should be cut off close to the ligature, and the parts kept anointed\r\nwith vaseline, to which 2 per cent of compound cresol has been added. In\r\nplace of a pin suture, silver wire, catgut, or strong linen thread may be\r\nused in the way of an ordinary suture.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE.\r\n\r\nSplinters of wood, hedge thorns, pieces of cornstalk or leaves, stems of\r\nhay or straw, twigs of trees, or weeds may penetrate into the eye, break\r\noff, and remain, causing inflammation, blindness, abscess, etc. These\r\nsubstances may penetrate the eyeball, but more frequently they glide off\r\nand enter between the eye and the ocular sheath.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Their removal becomes often a very difficult task, from the\r\nfact that the organ is so extremely sensitive, and the retracting power so\r\nstrong as to necessitate casting the animal, or even the administration of\r\nsufficient chloroform to render it completely insensible. The removal,\r\nhowever, is of paramount importance, and the after treatment depends upon\r\nthe extent and location of the injury--cold water compress over the injured\r\neye, the application of mild astringent and cooling washes, such as acetate\r\nor sulphate of zinc, 5 grains to the ounce of water. When there is extreme\r\nsuffering from pain a solution of atropia or morphia, 5 grains to the ounce\r\nof water, may be dropped into the eye, alternating with the cooling wash\r\nseveral times a day. When abscesses form within the orbit a free opening\r\nmust be maintained for the discharge of pus. In deep penetrating wounds of\r\nthe eye there is a great tendency to the formation of a fungous growth,\r\nwhich often necessitates the enucleation of the whole eyeball.\r\n\r\n\r\nORBITAL AND PERIORBITAL ABSCESS.\r\n\r\nOrbital abscess may form outside the globe and within the orbital sheath,\r\nas the result of a previous wound of the parts or from fracture of the bony\r\norbit, etc. Periorbital abscess commences outside the ocular sheath,\r\nbeneath the periosteal membrane covering the bone, and is usually the\r\nresult of a disease or fractured bone which enters into the formation of\r\nthe orbital cavity.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Orbital abscess is manifested by a pushing forward of the\r\neyeball (exophthalmos), a swelling of the conjunctiva and eyelids. The\r\nbulging out of the eye is in proportion to the size of the abscess; the\r\nmovement of the eye is fixed, due to the painfulness of any voluntary\r\nmovement of the eyeball. Periorbital abscess generally pushes the eye to\r\none side; otherwise the symptoms are similar to the foregoing. The pain\r\ngenerally is very great; paralysis of the nerve of sight may occur, and\r\ndeath may be caused by the abscess extending to the brain.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment for either orbital or periorbital abscess is\r\nthe same as that for abscess occurring in any other part of the body--a\r\nfree opening for the escape of imprisoned pus. This should be made as soon\r\nas the true nature of the disease is recognized. Afterwards antiseptic\r\ninjections may be needed to stimulate healthy granulation and to prevent\r\nseptic infection of the ocular membranes. For this purpose a saturated\r\nsolution of boric acid or listerine 1 part to 10 of water may be used. When\r\nthe fever runs high, Glauber's salt (sulphate of soda) may be given in\r\n4-ounce doses once a day. The animal should be kept in a darkened stable,\r\non soft or green feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRACTURE OF THE ORBIT.\r\n\r\nThis accident occasionally occurs among belligerent animals, or as the\r\nresult of blows delivered by brutal attendants. The orbital process above\r\nthe eye may be entirely crushed in, pressing down upon the eyeball. In such\r\nan event the depressed bone should be elevated into its proper place, and\r\nif it fails to unite it may have to be removed with saw or chisel. The\r\nmargin of the orbit may be crushed at any point and cause periorbital\r\nabscess, or necrosis may result from the presence of a splinter of bone or\r\nthe excessive destruction of bone. In all cases of fracture the animal\r\nshould be kept by itself until the injured part heals.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECROSIS OF THE BONY ORBIT.\r\n\r\nAs the result of fracture of the margin of the orbit a part of the injured\r\nbone may become necrosed (dead), and periostitis and periorbital abscess\r\nwill follow as a consequence. The discovery of this disease will at first\r\nresemble abscess, but on making an examination with a probe after the\r\nabscess is open we find the bone rough and brittle at the point of disease.\r\nThe discharge has a peculiar fetid odor, and is often mixed with blood.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The affected bone must be laid bare and all diseased portions\r\nremoved by scraping or, if necessary, with saw or chisel, disregarding the\r\nextent of the injury or the size of the wound necessary to be inflicted. A\r\nlarge portion of the bony orbit may be removed without serious danger to\r\nthe eye, provided the eyeball itself has not been previously affected by\r\nthe disease or involved in the original injury.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUMORS OF THE ORBIT.\r\n\r\nA fungous tumor of the eyeball or orbit occasionally appears, which is\r\ndesignated fungus hÊmatodes. This may arise without any appreciable cause,\r\nor as the result of a wound. It frequently commences within the eyeball as\r\na small, red mass, eventually bursts through, and pushes its way outside\r\nthe orbit as a large, dark-red mass, bleeding at the slightest touch. It\r\nhas a peculiar, fetid odor, and early in its appearance destroys sight,\r\ninvolving all the contents of the orbit, not infrequently the bony wall\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nUnless the tumor is totally removed in its early stage of growth, together\r\nwith the eyeball, the disease will eventually cause emaciation and death of\r\nthe animal. The enucleation of the eyeball should not be undertaken by\r\nanyone unacquainted with the anatomical structures involved in such an\r\noperation. When the operation is performed early enough the result is\r\ngenerally satisfactory.\r\n\r\nBony tumors of the orbit, the result of bruises, fractures, etc., are\r\noccasionally present in cattle. They may encroach upon the contents of the\r\norbit, causing paralysis of the optic nerve--the condition known as\r\namaurosis--or by pressure upon the posterior surface of the eyeball force\r\nit forward, or produce atrophy (shrinking). They may displace the eye in\r\nany direction, with or without disturbing vision.\r\n\r\nFibrous tumors growing within the orbit will produce symptoms similar to\r\nthose of bony tumors.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the outlines of the tumor, whether fungoid, bony, or\r\nfibrous, can be detected, an operation for its removal should be undertaken\r\nas soon as the sight of the eye is in any manner disturbed.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISLOCATION OF THE EYEBALL.\r\n\r\nThe eyeball may be torn out of its socket by the horns of another animal,\r\nor it may be crowded out with the blunt end of a club, cane, or probe in\r\nthe hands of a brutal attendant.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--When the optic nerve is not lacerated and the retractor\r\nmuscles at the back of the eye are intact, an attempt at reduction is\r\nadvisable. This, however, must follow very soon after the injury--before\r\nswelling takes place. Divide the outer corner of the eyelid to enlarge the\r\norifice, then by pressure with the fingers of both hands placed upon the\r\nsides of the eye the ball may be put into its place. Apply a firm compress\r\nover the injured eye and keep it constantly wet with cold water containing\r\n1 dram of sugar of lead to each quart.\r\n\r\nIf the attempt at reduction proves unsuccessful the artery at the back of\r\nthe eye should be ligated, and then the whole mass cut off as deep within\r\nthe orbit as possible. The orbital cavity, after washing it out with a 3\r\nper cent solution of carbolic acid or compound cresol, should be packed\r\ndaily with fresh absorbent cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION AND ENLARGEMENT OF THE HAW.\r\n\r\nThe haw, or membrana nictitans, is subject to inflammation and swelling\r\nfrom the extension of conjunctivitis, or direct injury by foreign\r\nsubstances. It presents a red, swollen appearance, accompanied with\r\nconsiderable pain and a profuse flow of tears. A slight scarification with\r\na sharp knife and the application of a cooling lotion, such as is\r\nrecommended for conjunctivitis, will soon reduce the swelling and restore\r\nit to its normal function.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a tendency for an inflammation of this membrane to take\r\non a chronic character, which may eventually result in a permanent\r\nenlargement, resembling a tumor. When it attains sufficient size to\r\nprotrude itself permanently over the eye, or project between the lids so as\r\nto obstruct the sight, its removal may become necessary. A threaded needle\r\nis passed through the body of the enlarged mass, by which the membrane is\r\ndrawn out as far as possible, then with a blunt pair of scissors it may be\r\ndissected away from its attachments. The eye is afterwards treated with\r\nsimple cooling lotions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\nBy M. R. TRUMBOWER, D. V. S.\r\n\r\n[Revised by Leonard Pearson, B. S., V. M. D.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDiseases of the ears of cattle are not very common, for the reasons\r\nprobably that they are not subjected to the brutality of drivers so much as\r\nhorses and that the horns to a great extent protect them against external\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTITIS (INFLAMMATION OF THE INTERNAL EAR).\r\n\r\nInflammation of the deep part of the ear is often difficult to recognize in\r\ncattle. It may be caused by disease of bone in that region, from blows\r\ninflicted by drivers, or from injury by other cattle. Occasionally the ear\r\nbecomes involved in actinomycosis (lumpy jaw), or the inflammation may be\r\nthe result of a tuberculous affection.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The animal will hold its head to one side, or shake it, while\r\nthe ear itself is held immovable. The movement of the jaws in eating\r\nusually gives rise to a manifestation of pain; the base of the ear may be\r\nfeverish and swollen, and very sensitive to the touch. If the inflammation\r\nhas advanced to a suppurative stage, offensive matter will flow from the\r\near.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--At first, hot fomentations to reduce pain and fever, followed\r\nby a sharp blister below the ear. Laudanum, 1 part to 10 of sweet oil, may\r\nbe injected into the ear to relieve pain and to soften the secretions. If\r\nthere is a discharge from the ear, it should be thoroughly washed out by\r\ninjecting warm soapsuds until all the matter has been washed away; then\r\ninject the following mixture twice a day: Sulphate of morphia, 20 grains;\r\nwater, 1 pint; glycerin, 4 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\nABSCESS.\r\n\r\nAbscesses, caused by contusions, sometimes form about the base of the ear,\r\neither inside or outside. A serous cyst is found occasionally between the\r\ncartilage and the skin on the base of the ear, which may be from a similar\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--With the knife make a free incision into the most prominent\r\npart of the abscess or cyst, then, with a syringe, wash out the sac with\r\ncarbolized water. If the abscess recurs, open it again, wash it out, and\r\ninject tincture of iodin, or fill it with iodoform.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNGOID GROWTHS.\r\n\r\nAs a result of laceration or wound of any kind, fungous growths,\r\ncharacterized by a raw, bleeding, granulating surface, with a tendency to\r\nbecome pendulous, may develop on the ear.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The whole tumor or diseased structure should be cut away, and\r\nthe wound treated daily with a dressing of carbolized cosmoline or\r\nturpentine and sweet oil, 1 part of the former to 4 of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE EAR.\r\n\r\nBugs have been known to gain entrance into the ears of animals. I once\r\nremoved an acorn from the ear of a cow that had been roaming in the woods;\r\nalso pieces of wood from a stanchion may be lodged accidentally in the ear.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--There is usually a continuous uneasiness or frequent shaking\r\nof the head, occasionally the manifestation of exceedingly great pain. The\r\nanimal may rub the head and ear against trees or other objects in an\r\nendeavor to dislodge the offending body.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A careful examination reveals the cause, which may be removed\r\nwith a pair of forceps or scraped out with a hairpin or piece of wire bent\r\nat one end. If much inflammation exists, the ear may be swollen so that the\r\nforeign substance is hidden from sight; then a probe may be inserted to\r\nfeel for the object, which, when found, should be removed, even if it\r\nbecomes necessary to split the ear at the base. Afterwards treat the ear\r\nwith frequent warm water fomentations and the injection of soapy water or\r\noil and water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCURFY EARS.\r\n\r\nCattle are subject to scurfy ears, which may be owing to a generally morbid\r\ncondition of the skin, or may be confined to the ears alone. The affected\r\nanimal shows an inclination to rub the ear; thick scales, which sometimes\r\nhave the appearance of hard, dry, horny scales, of scurf collect on it.\r\nThis condition is chiefly caused by a faulty secretion of the sebaceous\r\nglands of the ear. Thoroughly clean the ear with a stiff brush, then anoint\r\nit, so far as affected, with vaseline 4 parts to 1 part of white\r\nprecipitate ointment. If the scurfy ears are only a part of a general\r\nscurfiness of the skin, the condition of the animal needs attention. (See\r\n\"Pityriasis,\" p. 329.)\r\n\r\n\r\nFROSTBITE.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon among young cattle which are poorly nourished and\r\nexposed outdoors to storms and extreme cold to suffer frostbite of the ear,\r\nwhich may constitute actual freezing of the part.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Frostbite presents naturally every degree of severity from the\r\nmere chilling of the tip of the ear to positive freezing and death of a\r\nportion. In a day or two after the freezing has occurred the ear becomes\r\nswollen and very painful; the dead part remains cold and begins to shrivel;\r\na line of separation then forms between the inflamed and the dead or dying\r\nportion, and finally the piece destroyed drops off, leaving a raw healing\r\nsurface. When the ear is only slightly affected by the cold, an excoriation\r\nor peeling off of superficial skin takes place, accompanied with some pain\r\nand itching.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--A good liniment for frozen ears is a mixture of turpentine,\r\nammonia, and chloroform, of each 1 part, added to 6 parts of sweet oil. Rub\r\nthis on the ear several times a day. It will relieve pain and stimulate the\r\ncirculation, thus favoring a recovery of the injured structures.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACERATIONS OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\nAggressive dogs are the most frequent cause of lacerated ear, generally\r\nleaving a torn, ragged edge and bruised cartilage.\r\n\r\nIf the wound is extensive, a trimming of the ragged edges becomes\r\nnecessary; then the edges should be fastened together with silver wire,\r\ncatgut, or strong, thick, linen thread, taking a deep hold, and pine tar\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASE OF THE CARTILAGE AND NECROSIS.\r\n\r\nOccasionally the cartilages of the ear become affected, usually the result\r\nof a deep bruise; pus forms, burrows under the skin, and may find a\r\ndischarge from any part of the ear more or less distant from the seat of\r\nthe disease. When the cartilage has been extensively injured, pieces of it\r\nmay become dead (necrosed) and dissolve, to be carried away with the pus,\r\nor it may lead to extensive sloughing and the formation of numerous running\r\nsores. In the disease of the cartilage there is seldom much swelling or\r\ngreat pain. The discharge is usually very offensive, and occasionally\r\nstreaked with blood. Whenever there is a long-continued, persistent\r\ndischarge from one or more openings in the ear, disease of the cartilage\r\nmay be suspected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The sinus formed by the passage of matter should be probed\r\nand searched to the bottom for the presence of a foreign substance or the\r\nevidence of decaying cartilage. When the probe touches necrosed cartilage\r\nit will feel like a piece of dry leather or partially softened wood. A\r\ncounter opening must then be made at this place, and all diseased cartilage\r\ncut away with the knife. The subsequent treatment consists in keeping the\r\nartificial wound open for the discharge of pus, and the injection of\r\nchlorid of zinc, 5 grains to the ounce of water, once or twice a day, until\r\nthe wound is healed.\r\n\r\n\r\nENCHONDROMA OF THE EAR.\r\n\r\nThis is an excessive growth of cartilage, found at the base of the ear in\r\nthe form of a hard, painless tumor, firmly attached to the movable ear. The\r\nonly recourse for its removal is the knife in the hands of one acquainted\r\nwith the anatomy of the part involved in the operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS DISEASES OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\nRevised by JOHN R. MOHLER, A. M., V. M. D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry._\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nThe importance, to the farmer and stock raiser, of a general knowledge of\r\nthe nature of infectious diseases need not be insisted on, as it must be\r\nevident to all who have charge of farm animals. The growing facilities for\r\nintercourse between one section of a country and another, and between\r\ndifferent countries, cause a wide distribution of the infectious diseases\r\nonce restricted to a definite locality. Not only the animals themselves,\r\nbut the cars, vessels, or other conveyances in which they are carried may\r\nbecome agents for the dissemination of disease. The growing tendency of\r\nspecialization in agriculture, which leads to the maintenance of large\r\nherds of cattle, sheep, and hogs, makes infectious diseases more common and\r\nmore dangerous. Fresh animals are being continually introduced which may be\r\nthe carriers of disease from other herds, and when disease is once brought\r\ninto a large herd the losses become very high, because it is difficult, if\r\nnot impossible, to check it after it has once obtained a foothold.\r\n\r\nThese considerations make it plain that only by the most careful\r\nsupervision by intelligent men who understand the nature of infectious\r\ndiseases and their causes in a general way can these be kept away. We must\r\nlikewise consider how incomplete our knowledge concerning many diseases is,\r\nand probably will be for some time to come. The suggestions and\r\nrecommendations offered by investigators, therefore, may not always be\r\ncorrect, and may require frequent modification as our information grows\r\nmore comprehensive and exact.\r\n\r\nAn infectious disease may be defined as any malady caused by the\r\nintroduction, into the body, of minute organisms of a vegetable or animal\r\nnature which have the power of indefinite multiplication and of setting\r\nfree certain peculiar poisons which are chiefly responsible for the morbid\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThis definition might include diseases caused by certain animal parasites,\r\nsuch as trichinÊ, for example, which multiply in the digestive tract, but\r\nwhose progeny is limited to a single generation. By common consent the term\r\n\"infectious\" is restricted to those diseases caused by the invasion and\r\nmultiplication of certain very minute unicellular organisms included under\r\nthe general classes of bacteria and protozoa. Nearly all the diseases of\r\ncattle for which a definite cause has been traced are from bacteria. Among\r\nthese are tuberculosis, anthrax, blackleg, and tetanus (or lockjaw). Some\r\ndiseases, such as Texas fever and nagana, are traceable to protozoa, while\r\nothers, like actinomycosis and aspergillosis, are caused by fungi. Those\r\ndiseases of which the cause is unknown or imperfectly worked out are\r\npleuropneumonia, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, rabies, cowpox,\r\nmalignant catarrh, and dysentery.\r\n\r\nBacteria may be defined as very minute, unicellular organisms of a\r\nplantlike character. Their form is very simple, as may be seen from an\r\ninspection of the various species depicted on Plate XXVIII. The description\r\nof these figures will be found on page 360. The magnification there given\r\nwill furnish the reader some idea of their very minute size. They multiply\r\nin two ways. The bacterium elongates and then divides in the middle to form\r\n2 daughter cells. These go through the same process at once, and thus 4\r\ncells are produced. The division of these leads to 8, the division of 8 to\r\n16, and so on indefinitely. The rapidity with which this multiplication\r\ntakes place depends upon the nature of the bacterium. The bacillus of\r\ntuberculosis multiplies very slowly, while that of anthrax does so with\r\ngreat rapidity, provided both are in the most favorable condition. Another\r\nmode of reproduction, limited to certain classes of bacteria, consists in\r\nthe formation of a spore within the body of the bacterium. Spore formation\r\nusually takes place when the conditions pertaining to the growth of the\r\nbacteria become unfavorable. The spores are much more resistant to\r\ndestructive agents than the bacteria which produced them. The anthrax spore\r\nmay live several years in a dried state, but the anthrax bacillus perishes\r\nin a few days under like conditions. This matter will be referred to again\r\nwhen we come to discuss the subject of disinfection.\r\n\r\nOf the protozoa which cause disease very little is at present known. One\r\nwhich produces Texas fever is pictured on Plate XLV, in figs. 4 and 5.\r\nThese parasites have a more complex life history than bacteria; and as they\r\ncan not be grown in artificial media, their thorough investigation is at\r\npresent hampered with great difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the symptoms and lesions of the various infectious\r\ndiseases are due to differences in the respective organisms causing them.\r\nSimilarly the great differences observed in the sources from which animals\r\nbecome infected and the manner in which infection takes place are due to\r\ndifferences in the life history of these minute organisms. Much discussion\r\nhas taken place of late years concerning the precise meaning of the words\r\n\"infection\" and \"contagion.\"\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nVARIOUS BACTERIA WHICH PRODUCE DISEASE IN CATTLE.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE XXVIII.\r\n\r\nThe bacteria on this plate are partly from tissues, partly from cultures,\r\nand stained artificially with aniline colors (fuchsin or methylene blue).\r\nFigs 6 and 7 are copied from Fr‰nkel and Pfeiffer's atlas.

ZEESE-WILKINSON CO., INC., N.Y.\r\n   VARIOUS BACTERIA WHICH PRODUCE DISEASE IN CATTLE.]\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese words, however, are now wholly inadequate to express the complex\r\nprocesses of infection, and it may be said that each species of bacterium\r\nor protozoon has its own peculiar way of invading the animal body,\r\ndiffering more or less from all the rest. There are, however, a few broad\r\ndistinctions which may be expressed with the help of these old terms.\r\nInfection, as laid down above, refers at present in a comprehensive way to\r\nall microorganisms capable of setting up disease in the body. Some\r\nmicroorganisms are transmitted directly from one animal to another, and the\r\ndiseases produced may be called contagious. Among these are included\r\npleuropneumonia, rinderpest, foot-and-mouth disease, rabies, cowpox, and\r\ntuberculosis. Again, certain organisms are perhaps never transmitted from\r\none animal to another, but may come from the soil. Among these are tetanus,\r\nblackleg, anthrax to a large extent, and perhaps actinomycosis in part.\r\nThese diseases, according to some authorities, may be called miasmatic.\r\nThere is a third class of infectious diseases, the specific bacteria of\r\nwhich are transmitted from one animal to another, as with the contagious\r\ndiseases, but the bacteria may, under certain favorable conditions, find\r\nfood enough in the soil and in the surroundings of animals to multiply to\r\nsome extent after they have left the sick animal and before they gain\r\nentrance into a healthy one.\r\n\r\nThis general classification is subject to change if we take other\r\ncharacteristics into consideration. Thus tuberculosis, because of its\r\ninsidious beginning and slow course, would not by many be considered\r\ncontagious in the sense that foot-and-mouth disease is; yet, in either\r\ncase, the bacillus must come from preexisting disease. The disease of\r\nrabies, or hydrophobia, is not contagious in the sense that rinderpest is,\r\nbecause the virus of rabies must be inoculated into a wound before it can\r\ntake effect; yet, in both cases, the virus passes without modification from\r\none animal to another, though in different ways.\r\n\r\nAgain, all the diseases under the second group, which seem to come from the\r\nsoil and from pastures, are in one sense contagious in that the virus may\r\nbe taken from a sick animal and inoculated directly, with positive results,\r\ninto a healthy animal. Other illustrations may be cited which show that\r\nthese old terms are not in themselves satisfactory. There are so many\r\nconditions which enter into the process of infection that no single\r\nclassification will give a sufficiently correct or comprehensive idea of\r\nit. These statements will be easily understood if the different infectious\r\ndiseases in the following pages are studied with reference to the way or\r\nways in which each disease may be contracted. Enough has been said,\r\ntherefore, to show that if we wish to make ourselves acquainted with the\r\ndangers of any given disease, we must study it and not rely upon any single\r\nwork to tell the whole story.\r\n\r\nInfectious diseases have, as a general rule, a period of incubation, which\r\ncomprises the time elapsing between the exposure to the infection and the\r\nactual appearance of the disease. This period varies with the malady. The\r\nmost common symptom of this class of diseases is fever. The severity of the\r\nfever is measured by the temperature of the animal; this is readily and\r\naccurately ascertainable by the clinical thermometer. (See Pl. III, fig.\r\n1.) The other symptoms are variable and depend upon the particular organ or\r\norgans most implicated. Loss of appetite, cessation of rumination and milk\r\nsecretion, and general dullness are symptoms quite invariably present in\r\nmost infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of infectious diseases secondary diseases or\r\ncomplications may arise which are largely caused by bacteria other than\r\nthose producing the original malady. These complications are often so\r\nsevere as to become fatal. In general it may be stated that they are due to\r\nfilthy surroundings, and hence cleanliness may become an important aid to\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of infectious diseases is given under each malady so far as\r\nthis is allowable or advisable. These diseases are not, as a rule, amenable\r\nto treatment. When the symptoms have once appeared the disease is liable to\r\nrun its course in spite of treatment, and if it is one from which animals\r\nusually recover, all that can be done is to put them into the most\r\nfavorable surroundings. Many infectious diseases lead sooner or later to\r\ndeath, treatment is useless so far as the sick are concerned, and it may be\r\nworse than useless for those not yet infected. All animals suffering with\r\ninfectious diseases are more or less directly a menace to all others. They\r\nrepresent for the time being manufactories of disease germs, and they are\r\ngiving them off more or less abundantly during the period of disease. They\r\nmay infect others directly or they may scatter the virus about, and the\r\nsurroundings may become a future source of infection for healthy animals.\r\nThis leads us to the subject of prevention as the most important of all\r\nwhich claim our attention. In this place only a few general remarks will\r\nsuffice to bring the subject before the reader.\r\n\r\nThe most important thing is to keep disease away from a herd or farm. To do\r\nthis all sick or suspicious animals should be avoided. A grave form of\r\ndisease may be introduced by apparently mild or trivial cases brought in\r\nfrom without. It is generally conceded that continual change and movement\r\nof animals are the most potent means by which infectious diseases are\r\ndisseminated.\r\n\r\nWith some cattle diseases, such as anthrax, rinderpest, and\r\npleuropneumonia, preventive inoculation is resorted to in some countries.\r\nThis may be desirable when certain diseases have become established in any\r\nlocality so that eradication is impossible. It should not be practiced in\r\nterritories where a given disease may still be extirpated by ordinary\r\nprecautions. Preventive inoculation is applicable to only a few maladies,\r\nand therefore its aid in the control of diseases is limited.\r\n\r\nWhen an infectious disease has gained foothold in a herd the course to be\r\npursued will depend upon the nature of the malady. A good rule is to kill\r\ndiseased animals, especially when the disease is liable to run a chronic\r\ncourse, as in tuberculosis. The next important step is to separate the well\r\nfrom the sick by placing the former on fresh ground. This is rarely\r\npossible; hence the destruction or removal of the sick, with thorough\r\ndisinfection of the infected locality, is the next thing to be done. As to\r\nthe disinfectants to be used, special directions are given under the\r\nvarious diseases, to which the reader is referred. Here we will simply call\r\nattention briefly to the general subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISINFECTION AND DISINFECTANTS.\r\n\r\nDisinfection consists in the use of certain substances which possess the\r\npower to destroy bacteria or their spores, or both. Those which are\r\ncheapest and most available for animal diseases are ordinary freshly slaked\r\nlime or unslaked in powder, chlorid of lime, crude carbolic acid, corrosive\r\nsublimate, formaldehyde gas, formalin, and compound cresol solution.\r\n\r\n(1) Slaked lime is perhaps the most easily procured, but its disinfecting\r\npower is limited.   While it is capable of destroying all bacteria in their\r\nvegetative state, it is unable to destroy such spores as those of anthrax\r\nand blackleg. It is probable, however, that in incrusting spores it may\r\ndestroy their vitality sooner or later. It is regarded as safe practice to\r\nuse only spore-destroying substances for the virus of those diseases of\r\nwhich we have no definite knowledge. Nevertheless, in the absence of other\r\ndisinfectants, lime is very useful. It may be employed as a whitewash on\r\nwood and stone and sprinkled as a dilute wash or in powder over yards,\r\nmanure heaps, and over carcasses before they are buried, and over the\r\nground on which they have lain to prevent other animals from carrying the\r\ninfection away.\r\n\r\n(2) Chlorid of lime is more efficient than simple slaked or unslaked lime,\r\nas it destroys spores. It is the ordinary bleaching powder of commerce and\r\nis quite unstable, hence old preparations, unless sealed, are of little\r\nvalue. A 5 per cent solution is sufficiently strong for all spore-bearing\r\nbacteria (3 ounces in 2 quarts of water). It may be efficiently applied to\r\nthe walls and floor of an infected stable by mixing with limewash in the\r\nproportion of 6 ounces of the lime to each gallon of limewash. The ceilings\r\nand those portions of the walls which can not be reached should be\r\ndisinfected by means of chlorin gas liberated from the chlorid of lime by\r\ncrude carbolic acid. This is accomplished by making a cone of 5 or 6 pounds\r\nof chlorid of lime, in the top of which a deep crater is made for the\r\nplacement of from 1 to 2 pints of crude acid. The edge of the crater is\r\nthereupon pushed into the fluid, when a lively reaction follows. The fumes\r\nof chlorin are strongly irritating to the respiratory tract and therefore\r\nall live stock should be removed before the work is started. Owing to the\r\nheat generated, it is advisable to place the lime in an iron crucible and\r\nto have nothing inflammable within a radius of 2 feet. The number and\r\nlocation of these cones of chlorid of lime depend on the size and structure\r\nof the building to be disinfected. As a rule, it may be stated that chlorin\r\ngas liberated from the above-sized cone will be sufficient for disinfecting\r\n5,200 cubic feet of air space.\r\n\r\n(3) Crude carbolic acid. The ordinary purified carbolic acid is too\r\nexpensive to be used on a large scale, and the crude produce is a very good\r\nsubstitute. This is made more powerful by mixing with it an equal volume\r\nof commercial sulphuric acid. While the sulphuric acid is being added to\r\nthe crude carbolic acid much heat is evolved, and if the glass jar in which\r\nthe two are mixed is placed in cold water the resulting product is said to\r\nhave a higher disinfecting power. The mixture is added to water enough to\r\nmake a 5 per cent solution (about 7 ounces to 4 quarts of water). This is\r\nstrong enough for all purposes. It may be kept in wood or glass, but not\r\nin metal, owing to the corroding action of the acid. It should be used\r\nfreely on woodwork and on infected floors, and a force pump of the kind\r\nused by orchardists is very convenient as a means of applying the\r\ndisinfectant. If the solution is warm when applied, it will penetrate the\r\nwoodwork better than when cold, especially if the spraying is done during\r\ncold weather. The addition of air-slaked lime in any quantity that will\r\ndissolve in water to the above solution (say 1-1/2 pounds of lime to 7\r\nounces of crude carbolic acid to each gallon of water) is preferred by\r\nmany, as it makes any neglected places at once visible and leaves cleaner\r\nand better air within the buildings. In most cases in which its\r\napplication becomes desirable--and this rule should apply to all\r\ndisinfections--the disinfected stables, stalls, etc., should remain vacant\r\nas long as possible before cattle are again stabled therein.\r\n\r\n(4) Mercuric chlorid, or corrosive sublimate, is a powerful disinfectant,\r\nbut it is likewise very poisonous; hence its uses are limited. Cattle are\r\nespecially susceptible to its action and caution must be used in its\r\napplication. A solution of one-tenth of 1 per cent is usually sufficient\r\n(1 ounce to 8 gallons of water). It should not be placed in wooden pails,\r\nwhich would form the tannate of mercury, a weak antiseptic; nor, owing to\r\nits corrosive action, should expensive metal pails be used. Agate vessels\r\nor tin pails are to be preferred. All solutions should be labeled \"poison,\"\r\nand to avoid accidents none should be kept on hand.\r\n\r\n(5) Formalin and formaldehyde gas have been found very efficacious as\r\nsanitary agents. Formalin is the commercial name for the 40 per cent\r\nsolution of formaldehyde gas in water, and is one of the most powerful\r\nantiseptic and disinfectants that we possess. Solutions of this strength\r\nare manufactured by different commercial houses and sold by the drug trade\r\nunder the name of \"formalose\" and \"formal.\" In this connection it should be\r\nmentioned that while the 40 per cent solution of formaldehyde gas and\r\nformalin are exactly the same thing, the former can be purchased at 33-1/3\r\nto 64 per cent less than the latter. Formalin, diluted with water in the\r\nproportion of 1 pint to 30 parts of water, or 4 ounces to each gallon of\r\nwater, may be applied, and it may thus be used as a wash or as a spray on\r\nall paints, metals, and woodwork, as well as on clothing and other fabrics,\r\nwithout injuring them. It may also be applied to floors, walls, and\r\nwoodwork in whitewash by mixing 1 part to 30 parts of limewash, or 4 ounces\r\nto each gallon of limewash. Formalin has the appearance of water and in the\r\nstrong solution is poisonous, but when diluted as recommended above it is\r\nnot dangerous. The fumes given off by it, however, are very disagreeable\r\nand irritating to the eyes and nasal mucous membranes. One and one-half\r\nounces of formalin added to 1 gallon of water is a valuable agent for the\r\ndisinfection of the skin or septic wounds, but is somewhat painful and\r\nirritating to raw surfaces.\r\n\r\nFormaldehyde is a gas which is soluble in 2-1/2 parts of water (40 parts of\r\nformaldehyde gas to 100 parts of water); this solution constitutes the\r\nformalin of commerce. The use of formaldehyde gas is in most cases\r\nimpracticable for stable disinfection. In case the stable is not too large\r\nand can be made almost air-tight the generation of formaldehyde gas, after\r\nremoving all the animals, will be found very serviceable. It penetrates all\r\nparts of the stable--the walls, crevices, floors, ceiling--and is probably\r\nthe best fumigating disinfectant that we have.\r\n\r\nProbably one of the most simple and practical methods of liberating this\r\ngas is by means of the chemical reaction which takes place when formalin is\r\npoured upon permanganate of potassium. For each 1,000 cubic feet of air\r\nspace, 16-2/3 ounces of crystallized or powdered permanganate of potassium\r\nis placed in a wide-surfaced pan; 20 ounces of formalin is then poured upon\r\nit, and the stable immediately closed for a period of 12 hours or longer.\r\nThis method is efficient only when it is possible to seal tightly the place\r\nto be disinfected, and should be used only by experienced persons.\r\n\r\n(6) Some coal-tar products are cheap, effective, and easily applied\r\ndisinfectants, their action being due to the carbolic acid and creosote in\r\ntheir composition. They may be used in 3 to 5 per cent solution. As a rule\r\nthey form a milky solution in water.\r\n\r\n(7) Compound solution of cresol (liquor cresolis compositus), now\r\nrecognized as an official preparation, is composed of equal parts of cresol\r\nand linseed-oil-potash soap. The mixture is a thick, dark, amber-colored\r\nfluid which mixes readily with water in all proportions to form a clear,\r\nsoap solution. It is an efficient disinfectant in a 3 or 4 per cent\r\nsolution, and in this strength it may be applied in the same manner as a 5\r\nper cent solution of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to apply one of these above-mentioned agents to the\r\nstable or barnyard, a preliminary cleaning up of all dÈbris and litter is\r\nadvisable, together with the scraping of the floor, mangers, and walls of\r\nthe stable with hoes; also the removal of all dust and filth. This should\r\nbe followed by the burning of all such accumulations, inasmuch as this\r\nmaterial likewise contains the infectious principle and is best destroyed\r\nby heat. Heat may be applied to the surface of the affected pen, byre, or\r\nbarnyard by means of a cyclone burner, which consists of a tank, pump,\r\nhose, and cyclone nozzle for spraying with paraffin (gas oil). The latter\r\nis ejected in the form of spray, which when ignited gives a very hot and\r\neffective flame to be applied to the infected ground. Where such burning is\r\nimpracticable the surface soil of the yard and surroundings should be\r\nremoved to a depth of 5 or 6 inches and then placed in a heap and\r\nthoroughly mixed with air-slaked lime. The fresh surface of the soil thus\r\nexposed may then be sprinkled with the disinfectant.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these artificial substances there are several natural\r\nsanitary agents of great importance as destroyers of virus. These are\r\ncleanliness, ventilation, drying, and sunshine. All virus, excepting such\r\nas may live in the soil, is killed sooner or later by drying and sunshine,\r\nand the importance of these factors in the daily life of animals need not\r\nbe insisted on here. Finally, all sanitary measures which contribute to the\r\nhealthfulness of animal surroundings are directly or indirectly inimical to\r\ndisease germs, and all carelessness in the keeping of animals may be\r\nregarded as an ally of these destructive organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA.\r\n\r\n[Pls. XXIX-XXXII.]\r\n\r\n_Definition and history._--This disease has been eradicated from the United\r\nStates, and it is not probable that it will ever be seen in this country\r\nagain. As, however, much interest was manifested in regard to it for a\r\nnumber of years, and as our cattle are still prohibited from some foreign\r\nmarkets on account of its previous existence here, the subject is treated\r\nat greater length than would otherwise be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe contagious pleuropneumonia of cattle is a specific, epizootic disease\r\nwhich affects bovine animals, and from which other species are exempt. It\r\nis characterized, when the disease results from exposure in the usual\r\nmanner, by an inflammation of the lungs and pleurÊ, which is generally\r\nextensive, and which has a tendency to invade portions of these organs not\r\nprimarily affected and to cause death of the diseased portion of the lung.\r\nThis disease is frequently called the lung plague, which corresponds to its\r\nGerman name of Lungenseuche. In French it is spoken of as the pÈripneumonie\r\ncontagieuse.\r\n\r\nThe history of the contagious pleuropneumonia of cattle can not be traced\r\nwith any certainty to a period earlier than the beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. No doubt it existed and ravaged the herds of Europe for many years\r\nand perhaps centuries before that time, but veterinary knowledge was so\r\nlimited that the descriptions of the symptoms and post-mortem appearance\r\nare too vague and too limited to admit of the identification of the\r\nmaladies to which they refer. It has been supposed by some writers that\r\ncertain passages in the writings of Aristotle, Livy, and Virgil show the\r\nexistence of pleuropneumonia at the time that their works were composed,\r\nbut their references are too indefinite to be seriously accepted as\r\nindicating this rather than some other disease.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite plain that as early as 1713 and 1714 pleuropneumonia existed\r\nin Swabia and several Cantons of Switzerland. There are even clearer\r\naccounts of its prevalence in Switzerland in 1732, 1743, and 1765. In 1769\r\na disease called murie was investigated in Franche-ComtÈ by Bourgelat which\r\nundoubtedly was identical with the pleuropneumonia of to-day. From that\r\nperiod we have frequent and well-authenticated accounts of its existence in\r\nvarious parts of Europe. During the period from 1790 to 1812 it was spread\r\nthroughout a large portion of the Continent of Europe by the cattle driven\r\nfor the subsistence of the armies, which marched and countermarched in all\r\ndirections. It was generally prevalent in Italy in 1800. It appears to have\r\nbeen unknown, however, in the Department of the Nord, France, until 1826,\r\nbut during the years from 1820 to 1840 it penetrated into most parts of\r\nthat country. During the same period it was introduced into and allowed to\r\nspread over Belgium and Holland.\r\n\r\nThis contagion is said to have been carried to Ireland from Holland in\r\n1839, and is reported as existing in England in 1842. The disease was\r\nbrought to the United States at several different times. Probably its first\r\nintroduction was with a diseased cow sold in Brooklyn, N. Y., in 1843. It\r\ncame to New Jersey by importing affected animals in 1847. Massachusetts was\r\ninfected in the same way in 1859.\r\n\r\nSouth Africa was infected by a bull brought from Holland in 1854, and\r\nAustralia likewise received the contagion with an English cow in 1858. It\r\nis also reported as existing in various parts of the Continent of Asia, but\r\nthe time of its first appearance and the extent of its distribution are\r\nvery uncertain.\r\n\r\nSome countries, such as Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, which had been\r\ninfected for only a short time, have succeeded in eradicating the disease\r\nwithout much difficulty by slaughtering all affected and exposed animals.\r\nOther countries long infected and in which the contagion was thoroughly\r\nestablished, like Australia, South Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, and\r\nparts of Germany, have labored long, in some cases making no progress and\r\nin others being only partially successful. Holland was one of the first of\r\nthe thoroughly infected countries to free itself from the contagion.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, Massachusetts eradicated pleuropneumonia during the\r\nperiod from 1860 to 1866. New York and New Jersey made an attempt to\r\neradicate it in 1879, but were not successful. Late in 1883 the contagion\r\nwas carried to Ohio, probably by Jersey cattle purchased in the vicinity of\r\nBaltimore, Md., to which place it had extended before 1868. From the herd\r\nthen infected it was spread by the sale of cattle during 1884 to a limited\r\nnumber of herds in Illinois, to one herd in Missouri, and to two in\r\nKentucky. The alarm caused among the stock owners of the United States by\r\nthis widespread dissemination of a disease so much dreaded led to the\r\nadoption of active measures for its control and eradication. By cooperation\r\nbetween the United States Department of Agriculture and the authorities of\r\nthe affected States it was found possible to prevent the further spread of\r\nthe contagion and to eradicate it after a few months' delay.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 pleuropneumonia was discovered in some of the large distillery\r\nstables of Chicago and among cows on neighboring lots. This led to renewed\r\nefforts for the complete extirpation of this disease from the country.\r\nCongress in 1887 enlarged the appropriation available for this purpose and\r\ngave more extended authority. During the same year the disease was stamped\r\nout of Chicago, and has not since appeared in any district west of the\r\nAllegheny Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe work of eradication was at the same time commenced in all the infected\r\nStates. Before the end of the year 1889 Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland,\r\nthe District of Columbia, and Virginia had been freed from the disease.\r\nMore difficulties, however, were encountered in the States of New York and\r\nNew Jersey, on account of the larger territory infected and the density of\r\nthe population. The long struggle was successful, however, and the last\r\nanimal in which the disease appeared in the State of New York was\r\nslaughtered early in 1891, and the last one affected in New Jersey met the\r\nsame fate early in the spring of 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XXIX.\r\n   Haines del.

ZEESE-WILKINSON CO., INC., N.Y.\r\n   CONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring these same years a supreme effort had been made to stamp out this\r\nlung plague from Great Britain. From the official reports it appears that\r\nthe number of infected districts and of diseased animals had rapidly\r\ndiminished, but it was not until 1898 that the infection was finally\r\neradicated.\r\n\r\nThe other infected European countries, though they maintain a veterinary\r\nsanitary service, are not making satisfactory progress in eradicating the\r\ndisease. This is owing partly to delays in carrying out the provisions of\r\nthe laws and partly to mistaken ideas as to the measures which are\r\nnecessary to accomplish the object. The United States was the last of the\r\ncountries having old infected districts which undertook to stamp out this\r\ncontagion, and, except Holland, it was the first to reach success.\r\n\r\n_The cause (etiology) of pleuropneumonia._--This is a contagious disease,\r\nand arises only by contagion from a previously affected animal;\r\nconsequently it can never be seen here except as the result of importing\r\naffected animals from the Old World. When thoroughly stamped out it does\r\nnot reappear; and if imported animals continue to be properly inspected and\r\nquarantined, we have every reason to believe that pleuropneumonia will\r\nnever again be seen in this country.\r\n\r\nThe exact nature of the virus or contagion of lung plague has never been\r\ndetermined. Various investigators have from time to time claimed the\r\ndiscovery of the specific organism of the disease, but it was not until\r\n1898 that Nocard and Roux, by an ingenious method of cultivation, succeeded\r\nin obtaining a very feeble growth of an exceedingly minute microorganism.\r\nWith these cultures the disease was produced in cattle.\r\n\r\nSome investigators and writers are of the opinion that the disease can be\r\ncontracted only by an animal coming near enough to a living diseased one to\r\nreceive the contagion directly from it. They hold that the contagion is\r\nexpired with the air from the affected lungs, and that it must be almost\r\nimmediately inspired by another animal in order to produce the disease.\r\nSome experimental attempts to infect animals by placing them in stables\r\nwhere diseased animals have been, and by placing the diseased lungs of\r\nslaughtered animals in their feeding troughs have failed, and,\r\nconsequently, apparently confirm this view.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA.\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXIX.

This variation of color is regarded by some as\r\nthe real marbling characteristic of pleuropneumonia, while the whitish\r\nbands penetrating the lung tissue in all directions constitute the true\r\nmarbling according to other observers.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXII. Contagious pleuropneumonia. This illustrates what are called\r\ninfarctions. The right half of the figure shows nearly normal lung tissue.\r\nThe left represents a blackish mass, in which the lung tissue is filled\r\nwith blood and solidified. This is caused by the plugging of the vein\r\ncarrying away the blood from this portion. The heart forces the blood\r\nthrough the artery into the tissue at considerable pressure, but owing to\r\nthe fact that its return is prevented, the minute blood vessels rupture and\r\nthe air vesicles become distended with blood, which coagulates and causes\r\nthe firmness of the tissue.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is known that the serum from affected lungs retains\r\nits virulence and may be used successfully for inoculation weeks or months\r\nafter the death of the animal from which it was taken. This is\r\nparticularly the case when this liquid is hermetically sealed in glass\r\ntubes. Other investigators state that they have successfully infected\r\ncattle by placing, in the nostrils, sponges or pledgets of cotton saturated\r\nwith such serum. Cattle have also, according to the best evidence\r\nobtainable, been infected from the clothing of attendants, from horns used\r\nin drenching, and from smelling about wagons which have been used to\r\ntransport affected carcasses. In the work of eradicating pleuropneumonia\r\nfrom the United States many stables were found in which the disease would\r\nappear and reappear after the slaughter of affected herds, and in spite of\r\nany precautions which were adopted. These were always old stables, with\r\nwoodwork in a decaying condition and with floors underlaid with filth which\r\ncould not be thoroughly removed or disinfected. In every one of these cases\r\nthe destruction of the stable, the burning of the lumber of which it was\r\nconstructed, the removal of the accumulations beneath the floors, and\r\nthorough disinfection, prevented the recurrence of the plague in new\r\nstables built upon the same premises. This experience conclusively shows\r\nthat under certain conditions, at least, stables may retain the infection\r\nfor a considerable time, and that when restocked the disease may break out\r\nagain from such infection.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, however, the disease is acquired by a healthy animal being near\r\nan affected one and receiving the contagion direct. Affected animals may\r\ngive off the contagion in the early stages of the disease before the\r\nsymptoms are apparent to the observer; also, they may retain this\r\ninfectious character, if they survive the attack, for six months and\r\nprobably for a year after all symptoms of the disease have disappeared.\r\n\r\n_Incubation._--The time which elapses between exposure to the contagion of\r\npleuropneumonia and the first appearance of the symptoms of this disease\r\nvaries greatly with different individuals and with different outbreaks of\r\nthe disease. Ordinarily the symptoms of disease make their appearance\r\nwithin three to six weeks after exposure; they may be observed, however,\r\nwithin two weeks or they may not become apparent until nearly or quite\r\nthree months. It is this long period of incubation and the great length of\r\ntime that an animal may disseminate the contagion after apparent recovery\r\nwhich give the plague that insidious character so often spoken of, and\r\nwhich greatly increase the difficulties of eradication.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms are such as would be expected with inflammation\r\nof the lungs and pleurÊ, but they vary considerably, according to the type\r\nwhich the disease manifests. If the attack is an acute one, as is\r\nfrequently seen in hot weather, the symptoms appear suddenly; the breathing\r\nbecomes rapid and difficult, the animal grunts or moans with each\r\nexpiration, the shoulders stand out from the chest, the head is extended on\r\nthe neck, the back is arched, the temperature is 104∞ to 107∞ F., the milk\r\nsecretion is suspended, there is no appetite, rumination is stopped, the\r\nanimal may bloat and later be affected with a severe diarrhea. Such cases\r\nare generally fatal in 7 to 20 days.\r\n\r\nVery often the attack comes on slowly and the symptoms are much less clear.\r\nIn the mildest cases there is a cough for a week or two, but no appreciable\r\nloss of appetite or elevation of temperature. The lungs are but slightly\r\naffected and recovery soon follows. Such animals may disseminate the\r\ncontagion for a long time without being suspected, and for that reason are\r\nthe most dangerous of all.\r\n\r\nA more severe type of the plague is the most frequently seen. In these\r\ncases the cough is frequent, more or less painful, the back somewhat\r\narched, and the milk secretion diminished. The prominence of these symptoms\r\nincreases, the appetite is affected, the animal loses flesh, the breathing\r\nbecomes more rapid, the cough more painful, pressure of the fingers between\r\nthe ribs shows tenderness, the hair loses its gloss and stands erect, the\r\nskin becomes adherent, little, if any, milk is secreted, and the\r\ntemperature rises, varying in different animals from 103∞ to 107∞ F.\r\nAnimals thus affected may continue to grow worse and die in from three to\r\neight weeks, or they may after a time begin to improve and make an apparent\r\nrecovery. The inflammation of the lung does not, as a rule, subside and the\r\norgan return to its normal condition, as is the case in ordinary pneumonia,\r\nbut with this disease the life of the affected portion of the lung is\r\ndestroyed, the tissue dies, and a fibrous wall is formed around it to shut\r\nit away from the living parts. The tissue, thus encysted, gradually\r\nsoftens, becomes disintegrated, and breaks down into pus. The recovery,\r\ntherefore, is not complete; it is only apparent and partial.\r\n\r\nTo those accustomed to examining the lungs of cattle, other and extremely\r\nimportant symptoms may be apparent during the course of the disease. By\r\napplying the ear over the walls of the chest an area of a certain extent\r\nmay be found in which the natural breathing sound is diminished or entirely\r\nlost. This represents the diseased portion of the lungs. In other cases a\r\nloud blowing sound may be heard, quite different from any sound produced\r\nwhen the lung is in a healthy condition. In some cases crepitation is heard\r\nnear the border line of the diseased area and friction sounds produced by\r\nthe roughened pleura; these can be appreciated, however, only by those\r\nwhose ears have been trained to distinguish between the different sounds\r\nwhich reach the ear when applied to the chest wall. By percussion--that is,\r\nby pressing the fingers of the left hand firmly against the wall of the\r\nchest and tapping upon the middle finger with the ends of the fingers of\r\nthe right hand--an area of dullness may be discovered corresponding to the\r\nportion from which the respiratory murmur has disappeared. This loss of\r\nrespiration detected by auscultation, and the dullness brought out by\r\npercussion, are the most important evidences of an inflamed or consolidated\r\nlung.\r\n\r\nSeriously affected animals remain standing if they have sufficient\r\nstrength, but those which lie down always lie on the affected side.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of animals which become affected after being exposed varies\r\naccording to the virulence of the outbreak, the susceptibility of the\r\nanimals, and the length of time during which exposure is continued.\r\nSometimes not more than 15, 20, or 30 per cent will contract the disease\r\nwhen a large herd is exposed; on the other hand, however, 80 or 90 per cent\r\nmay be affected. The proportion of cases in which the disease proves fatal\r\nalso varies greatly--it may not exceed 10 and it may reach 50 per cent. In\r\ngeneral, it may be said that about 40 per cent of the exposed animals will\r\ncontract the disease and about one-half of these cases will prove fatal.\r\n\r\n_Post-mortem appearances._--Owing to the complexity of the structure of the\r\nlung tissue, its ramifications of bronchial tubes and blood vessels, and\r\nits abundant supply of lymphatics, the pathological changes in\r\npleuropneumonia are interpreted with great difficulty. Furthermore, there\r\nare certain kinds of pneumonia which present some resemblances to\r\npleuropneumonia and which may therefore be confused with it in some of its\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nIf we kill an animal affected with acute pleuropneumonia and examine the\r\ncavity of the chest and lungs, the following appearances will be noted:\r\n\r\nThe thorax may contain more or less serum, which may be clear or clouded.\r\nThere may be firm adhesions of different parts of the lungs to the chest\r\nwall, the extent of which depends on the stage and severity of the disease.\r\nThe diseased lobes are unusually large and exceedingly firm to the touch.\r\nThe weight of a single large lobe may reach 40 pounds. Usually only one\r\nside is affected, often but a single lobe, and this most commonly the large\r\nor principal lobe. The pleura may be covered with one or more layers of a\r\nfirm, elastic, grayish membrane, which varies in thickness and which\r\nsometimes may be pulled away entirely. Sometimes it is absent. The pleura,\r\nhowever, is opaque and apparently very much thickened. This is owing to the\r\ndiseased condition of the connective tissue beneath the pleura, as will be\r\nexplained later. When an affected lobe is cut through at right angles to\r\nits long diameter, the cut surface presents a variety of interesting\r\nchanges. In the first place the spaces between the small subdivisions of\r\nthe lung (the lobules), which in the healthy lung are barely visible, are\r\ndistended with a yellowish-white, usually quite firm, substance, which is\r\ncoagulated fibrin. The cut surface thus appears divided into small fields\r\nby yellowish-white bands of varying thickness running in various directions\r\nthrough the lung tissue and beneath the pleura. (Pl. XXXI.) These bands may\r\nappear honeycombed and the spaces filled with yellowish fluid (serum) or\r\nthey may be uniformly solid. It will also be noticed that the space\r\nimmediately outside of and around the artery, vein, and air tube is\r\nsimilarly broadened by fibrinous deposits. Some authorities look upon these\r\nbands as constituting the so-called \"marbling\" of pleuropneumonia.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these changes which have taken place in the connective\r\ntissue between the lobules, the lung tissue itself may be markedly altered.\r\nCertain areas of the cut surface may be very firm in texture and of a\r\nbrownish-red color. The cut surface is granular or roughened, not smooth to\r\nthe eye. Other areas equally firm may be more grayish yellow and still\r\nothers may be blackish. (Pl. XXXII.) Besides these areas which represent\r\nsolidified (hepatized) lung tissue there may be others which approach the\r\nnormal lung tissue in color, are soft, and float in water. From these a\r\nmilky, purulent fluid may often be expressed. These different shades are\r\nrepresented in Plate XXXI, fig. 2, within a small compass. Some authorities\r\nare inclined to consider these variations in color on the same cut surface\r\nas the so-called marbling of pleuropneumonia. It matters not whether we\r\nregard the bands between the lobules or the varying shades of the lobules\r\nthemselves as the marbling, provided either or both are peculiar to\r\ncontagious pleuropneumonia. If we examine the blood vessels appearing on\r\nsuch cut surface they will usually be found plugged within the firmly\r\nhepatized regions. The artery contains a dark, soft, removable clot, the\r\nvein a grayish-pink, granular, fragile plug (thrombus), which adheres\r\nfirmly to the wall of the vein, and if this is slit open, indications of a\r\ndiseased condition of the inner coat will be readily detected. When large\r\nregions of the lung tissues are hepatized, the main air tube and its\r\nbranches are usually filled with grayish, cylindrical branched masses of\r\nfibrin that are easily removed, as they do not adhere to the mucous\r\nmembrane.\r\n\r\nThe views of pathologists differ as to the nature of the earliest changes\r\nin pleuropneumonia, and it is not within the scope of this work to present\r\ncontroverted or imperfectly developed theories. In the foregoing\r\ndescription we have taken as a type the acute pleuropneumonia in its fully\r\ndeveloped phase, which can scarcely be mistaken for any other disease. We\r\nhave seen that there is an inflammatory condition of the connective tissue\r\nbetween the lobules, resulting in the exudation of coagulable lymph. This\r\ninflammation is equally marked around the blood vessels and air tubes. It\r\nleads to inflammatory changes in the inner wall of the veins, and these\r\ncause the deposition of thrombi or plugs in the vessels, which prevent the\r\nreturn of the blood. The blood pumped into the lung tissue through the\r\nartery, but unable to get out by way of the vein, leaves the mesh-work of\r\ncapillaries around the air vesicles, enters the latter, and produces the\r\nfirm, hepatized condition so characteristic of this disease. If we bear in\r\nmind that the veins in different parts of the lung tissue are plugged at\r\ndifferent times, and that, therefore, the affected regions are in different\r\nstages of disease, it will be easily understood how the different shades of\r\ncolor from dark red to grayish or yellowish red are produced.\r\n\r\nThe complete plugging of the veins may lead to the death of circumscribed\r\nmasses of lung tissue. A line of separation forms between the living and\r\nthe dead tissue and a thick cyst wall of fibrous tissue forms around the\r\nlatter. The dead tissue for a time preserves the appearance of lung tissue,\r\nthen undergoes disintegration and liquefaction. The softened mass is\r\nfinally absorbed, and the walls of the cyst, or capsule around it,\r\ngradually collapse and form a cicatrix. This favorable termination takes\r\nplace only when the dead mass is not too large. It may, however, involve\r\nover half of one of the large lobes. Under such circumstances recovery is\r\nimprobable. A more favorable termination is the abundant growth of fibrous\r\ntissue around and into the hepatized masses. The formation of fibrous\r\ntissue may extend to the pleura, or lung covering, and cause firm adhesion\r\nof the lungs to the chest wall and to the pericardium, or heart case.\r\n\r\nThe same peculiar, inflammatory changes which take place between the\r\nlobules of the lung and around the bronchi and vessels may invade the\r\npleural cavity, cause extensive membranous and spongy deposits on the\r\npleura and firm deposits around the heart and large arteries, the gullet,\r\nand windpipe.\r\n\r\nThese are the main features of the lung disease caused by contagious\r\npleuropneumonia. In the typical, acute cases there are a sufficient\r\nnumber of peculiarities to enable us to make a positive diagnosis. There\r\nare, however, many cases in which the disease is restricted to small areas,\r\nor to the interlobular tissue, or in which the changes are still\r\nimperfectly developed, or else so far advanced that doubts may arise as to\r\nthe true nature of the affection. In such cases all obtainable facts,\r\nincluding the history of the case, the symptoms during life, and the\r\npathological changes observed on post-mortem examination must be taken into\r\nconsideration. Only one who has made a careful study of the disease is\r\nfitted to decide in such cases.\r\n\r\nOther kinds of lung disease, because of certain features common to most\r\nlung diseases of cattle, may be confounded with pleuropneumonia. The\r\ninflammation of the connective tissue between the lobules is not\r\ninfrequently observed in so-called interstitial pneumonia and may lead to\r\nthe formation of whitish bands intersecting the lung tissues in various\r\ndirections. On the cut surface these bands may give rise to a decidedly\r\nmarbled appearance. Again, in traumatic pneumonia, caused, as its name\r\nimplies, by the entrance of foreign bodies into the lung tissue, generally\r\nfrom the paunch, the connective tissue around the place of disease becomes\r\ninflamed and thickened, and the disease itself may simulate pleuropneumonia\r\nin its retrogressive stages when it is confined to a small portion of lung\r\ntissue. The filling up of the interlobular spaces with fibrin and\r\nconnective tissue of inflammatory origin is not thus limited to\r\npleuropneumonia, but may appear in a marked degree in other lung diseases.\r\nIt must not be inferred from this statement that these interlobular changes\r\nare necessarily the same as those in pleuropneumonia, although to the naked\r\neye they may appear the same. We simply note their presence without\r\ndiscussing their nature.\r\n\r\nIn general, the distinction between pleuropneumonia and bronchopneumonia is\r\nnot difficult to make. In the latter disease the pneumonia generally\r\ninvades certain lobes. The disease attacks the smaller lobes in their\r\nlowest portions first and gradually extends upward, i. e., toward the root\r\nof the lung or the back of the animal and backward into the large principal\r\nlobes. Again, both lungs in advanced cases are often symmetrically\r\naffected. In contagious pleuropneumonia the large principal lobe of one\r\nside is most frequently affected, and a symmetrical disease of both lungs\r\nis very rare, if, in fact, it has ever been observed. The lung tissue in\r\nbronchopneumonia is not enlarged, but rather more contracted than the\r\nnormal tissue around it. This is well illustrated in Plate XXX. Normal,\r\nair-containing lobules may be scattered among and around the hepatized\r\nportion in an irregular manner. In pleuropneumonia the diseased and healthy\r\nportions are either sharply divided off, one from the other, or else they\r\nshade into each other by intermediate stages.\r\n\r\nThe hepatized lung tissue in bronchopneumonia when the cut surface is\r\nexamined is visually of a more or less dark flesh color with paler\r\ngrayish-yellow dots regularly interspersed, giving it a peculiar, mottled\r\nappearance. In the more advanced stages it becomes more firm, and may\r\ncontain nodular and firmer masses disseminated through it. The air tubes\r\nusually contain more or less soft, creamy, or cheesy pus or a turbid fluid\r\nquite different from the loose, fibrinous casts of acute pleuropneumonia.\r\nThe interlobular tissue may or may not be affected. It sometimes contains\r\nloose, fibrinous plugs, or it may be greatly distended with air, especially\r\nin the still normal portions of the lung. The pleura is seldom seriously\r\ndiseased. If we contrast with these features the firm dark-red\r\nhepatizations, the plugging of the veins, the extensive interlobular\r\ndeposits, and the well-marked pleuritis in pleuropneumonia, there is little\r\nchance for confusion between well-developed cases of these two lung\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten, however, that the lesions of the disease known\r\nas contagious pleuropneumonia may be confined to the serous membranes of\r\nthe thorax, or they may be confined to the parenchyma of the lungs; they\r\nmay affect a whole lobe, or only a small portion of it; they may or may not\r\ncause the so-called marbled appearance. In the same way bronchopneumonia\r\nmay vary as to the parts of the lung affected, the extent of the lesions,\r\nthe degree and kind of pathological changes in the interlobular tissue, the\r\ncolor of the lung on cross section and the amount of hepatization. In\r\nindividual cases, therefore, it is often necessary to take into account the\r\nhistory of the animal, the course of the disease, and the communicability\r\nof the affection before a diagnosis can be made between the two diseases.\r\n\r\n_Prevention and treatment._--The prevention of pleuropneumonia, as of other\r\ncontagious diseases, consists in keeping animals so that they will not be\r\nexposed to the contagion. As the disease arises only by contagion, there is\r\nno possibility of an animal becoming affected with it unless it has been\r\nexposed. If, therefore, pleuropneumonia exists in a locality the owner of\r\nhealthy cattle should make every effort to keep his animals from coming\r\nnear affected ones or which have been exposed. He should be equally\r\nparticular not to allow persons who have been on the infected premises to\r\nvisit his own pastures, stables, or cattle.\r\n\r\nIf pleuropneumonia breaks out in a herd, every animal in it should be\r\nslaughtered, the stables thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and no other\r\ncattle allowed on the premises until a period of 90 days has elapsed.\r\n\r\nMedical treatment of affected animals is unavailing and should not be\r\nattempted. No matter how valuable the diseased animals may have been before\r\nthey contracted the disease, they should at once be destroyed and the\r\ncontagion eradicated. This is the best policy for the individual as well as\r\nfor the community.\r\n\r\nThe eradication of this disease by local or National Governments can be\r\nsuccessful only when the same principles are adopted and carried out as\r\nhere recommended for individual stables. It is then a difficult\r\nundertaking, simply because the contagion is generally widely disseminated\r\nbefore any measures are adopted, and because a great majority of cattle\r\nowners will never report the existence of the disease. Regulations must\r\ntherefore be enforced which will insure the prompt discovery of every herd\r\nin which the disease appears, as well as the destruction of all diseased\r\nand exposed animals and the thorough disinfection of the premises.\r\n\r\nTo discover pleuropneumonia sufficiently early for this purpose, the\r\ndistrict supposed to be infected should be clearly defined and inspectors\r\nshould be constantly employed to inspect every herd in it at least once in\r\ntwo weeks, or, better, once a week. No bovine animal should be allowed to\r\ngo out of the defined district alive, and all which enter it should be\r\ncarefully inspected to insure their freedom from disease. As an assistance\r\nto the discovery of diseased herds, every animal which, from any cause,\r\ndies in the infected district and every animal which is slaughtered, even\r\nif apparently in good health, should be the subject of a careful\r\npost-mortem examination. Many affected herds will be found in this way.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these measures it is also necessary to guard against the\r\nremoval of animals from one stable to another and the mixing of herds upon\r\ncommon pastures or in the public highways. The object must be to isolate\r\nevery individual's cattle as completely as possible, or otherwise a single\r\naffected animal may infect a dozen or more herds. To prevent surreptitious\r\nsale or trading of cattle, each animal must in some way be numbered and\r\nrecorded in the books kept by the official in charge of the district. In\r\nthe work of the United States Department of Agriculture a numbered metal\r\ntag was fastened to each animal's ear and index books were so arranged that\r\nwith a number given the owner could be at once ascertained, or from the\r\nowner's name the cattle for which he was responsible could be at once\r\nlearned. In this way, if an animal was missing from a stable, the fact\r\nbecame apparent at once, or if one too many was found in a stable the\r\nnumber in its ear would indicate where it came from.\r\n\r\nWhen pleuropneumonia is discovered by these means, the entire herd should\r\nbe slaughtered as soon as the formalities of appraisement can be arranged.\r\nIn country districts the carcasses should be buried, as it is generally\r\nimpracticable to dispose of them in any other way. In city districts the\r\nanimals may be taken to a slaughterhouse, with such precautions as are\r\npossible to prevent dissemination of the contagion. The animals should be\r\nslaughtered under the supervision of an inspector. The healthy carcasses\r\nmay be utilized for food, but the blood, entrails, and all diseased\r\ncarcasses should be heated to a temperature equal to that of boiling water\r\nor above, and then used for the manufacture of fertilizers.\r\n\r\nThe disinfection of premises should be thorough and should be carried out\r\nby a trained corps of men employed for the purpose. The floors of stables\r\nshould be removed, the accumulations removed from beneath them, the\r\ncontents of haylofts should be destroyed, and the woodwork and soil beneath\r\nthe stables should be thoroughly drenched with a solution of bichlorid of\r\nmercury, 1 part to 2,000 of water. After the flooring is replaced the\r\nwoodwork should be coated with limewash, containing one-fourth pound of\r\nchlorid of lime to the gallon of mixture.\r\n\r\nUsually in these cases the owners are dependent upon their herd of cows for\r\na living, and consequently it is difficult or impossible to hold the\r\nstables vacant for any considerable period. In a majority of instances\r\ncattle may be admitted at once to stables so disinfected, without the\r\nreappearance of the disease. Occasionally, however, it will reappear\r\nwithout apparent cause. For this reason the inspection and other measures\r\nmust be maintained in the infected district for six months or a year after\r\nthe last case of disease has been disposed of.\r\n\r\nMany people have objected to the slaughter of diseased and exposed animals\r\nas an unscientific and expensive method of eradicating the disease. To\r\nthese it may be answered that it is the only method which has ever proved\r\nsuccessful, and that in the end it is much more economical than temporizing\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nInoculation has been adopted in many countries, and has undoubtedly\r\nlessened the death rate, but where this practice is allowed the disease is\r\nkept up and spreads. For this reason it should be prohibited wherever there\r\nis a possibility and disposition to eradicate the contagion.\r\n\r\n\r\nRINDERPEST.\r\n\r\nRinderpest, also known as cattle plague, is an acute, infectious disease of\r\ncattle, in which the digestive organs are mainly involved. Though unknown\r\nin this country, the importance of having near at hand a few definite facts\r\nconcerning this disease, should it ever reach our shores, will be at once\r\nappreciated. A knowledge of such facts may aid in an early recognition of\r\nthe disease. It must not be forgotten, on the other hand, that a\r\nsuperficial knowledge of diseases, such as the layman may gain through\r\nreading, not infrequently leads to confounding comparatively harmless,\r\nnoninfectious maladies with such as are truly dangerous (foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease, rinderpest, etc), and causes temporary panics among stock owners.\r\n\r\nAccording to some authorities, rinderpest has its home in the territory\r\naround the Black Sea and the Volga River in Russia; according to others, in\r\nCentral Asia. Thence it has been conveyed at various times by cattle to\r\nnearly every country of Europe and Asia, where it has proved to be a\r\nveritable bovine scourge. It probably visited Europe as early as the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era, and since then the migrations of the people\r\nfrom the Far East have from time to time introduced the disease. Especially\r\nduring the eighteenth century it was more or less prevalent in Europe,\r\nowing to the frequent wars, during which herds of cattle were brought from\r\neastern Europe and Asia to supply the demands of the armies. It prevailed\r\nin Europe during the Franco-Prussian War. At present it exists in eastern\r\nEurope and in portions of Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe virus is conveyed from one country to another chiefly by means of\r\ninfected cattle, although infected hides, wool, and feed may play an\r\nimportant part in its dissemination. The railroad facilities of the\r\npresent, which furnish the means of such rapid communication, are\r\nparticularly liable to aid in the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn the past rinderpest has been supposed to be identical with various human\r\ndiseases, among them smallpox and typhoid fever. These suppositions are\r\nunfounded, and the view of authorities to-day is that it is a disease of a\r\npeculiar kind, not identical with any other known infectious disease.\r\n\r\n_The contagion of rinderpest._--The cause of rinderpest must be looked for\r\namong microorganisms--most likely bacteria. The investigations made thus\r\nfar for this causal factor have been fruitless. However, certain recent\r\nexperiments would indicate that the unseen microbe is of such dimensions\r\nthat it is withheld by the dense bacterial filters, but passes through the\r\nmore porous ones. Formerly it was supposed by various authorities that\r\nrinderpest virus appeared spontaneously under the influence of deteriorated\r\nfeed and long and exhausting drives; also during unusual meteorological\r\nconditions. This view, however, is no longer maintained. It is probable\r\nthat in its home in Asia the disease is perpetuated by continual infection\r\nof fresh animals, and some authorities go even so far as to believe that\r\nthe disease would be entirely stamped out, even in its native haunts, by a\r\ndestruction of all sick and infected herds. However this may be, the\r\nsuccess of such an undertaking would largely depend on the nature of the\r\ncause. If a strictly parasitic organism, like the contagion of\r\npleuropneumonia, it might be completely extirpated in this way. If,\r\nhowever, the germs or bacteria may live and multiply outside of the bovine\r\nbody, in the soil, water, or in some other animal, extirpation would be\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nThe virus may be transmitted in a variety of ways, both direct and\r\nindirect, from sick to healthy animals. It is said to be present in the\r\nvarious excreta, such as the discharges from the nose, and the saliva, the\r\nurine, and the manure, of the diseased. For months it retains its vitality\r\nin a moist state outside the body, and the disease is reported to have\r\ndeveloped after feeding hay a year after it had lain in an infected stable;\r\nhence manure and the fodder and bedding soiled with discharges may convey\r\nit. Persons may carry the virus on their shoes, clothing, or implements.\r\nEven small animals, such as cats and rats, which frequent barns and\r\nstables, have been looked upon as carriers of the virus.\r\n\r\nCattle are very susceptible to the disease, and in its virulent type all\r\nthose exposed are said to become infected. Buffaloes, sheep, and goats are\r\nlikewise susceptible, but in a less degree.\r\n\r\nIt is also claimed that animals after having passed through one attack\r\nsuccessfully resist future attacks. Inoculation with virus is said to\r\nproduce immunity, but in many cases the process of inoculation itself is\r\nfollowed by death.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of rinderpest are not very characteristic, and\r\nhence the diagnosis of a suspected case in the beginning of an invasion is\r\nattended with difficulties. Certain appearances which are characteristic of\r\none epizootic may be absent in another. Different observers are not quite\r\nagreed as to the most constant and important.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation, i. e., the time between the exposure to infection\r\nand the earliest outward symptoms, varies from three to nine days. The\r\nfirst sign is a very high fever, which may reach 107∞ F. The heat of the\r\nskin varies in different parts of the body, and may be felt at the base of\r\nthe ears and horns. Repeated chills are frequently observed. The pulse\r\nreaches 50 to 60 beats a minute, and in very severe attacks may rise to 90\r\nor 100.\r\n\r\nThe animal manifests great debility. The head droops and rests on some\r\nobject of support. One or both ears may droop. The coat is staring and the\r\nmuzzle dry. The secretion of milk diminishes very rapidly. Within twelve to\r\ntwenty hours the usual quantity may have become reduced one-half or\r\ntwo-thirds. The back is arched, and the four limbs are brought together\r\nunder the body.\r\n\r\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms with reference to the digestive and\r\nrespiratory organs become prominent. The mucous membrane of the mouth and\r\nthe nose, as well as that of the rectum and vagina, becomes reddened,\r\neither in patches or diffusely, and assumes a scarlet hue. The discharges,\r\nat first firm, become softer, and soon diarrhea sets in. This is said to be\r\none of the most constant symptoms. The rectum may become everted and\r\nparalyzed, and the bowels move spontaneously. The discharges become fetid,\r\nviscid, and streaked with blood. Coughing is a common symptom, and by some\r\nis considered characteristic. It is associated with discharges from the\r\nnose and vagina and dribbling of saliva from the mouth. The eyes also are\r\naffected. There is an increased formation of a viscid secretion which flows\r\ndown the face.\r\n\r\nAnother series of changes prominent in some epizootics and mild or absent\r\nin others are the ulcers, or so-called \"erosions,\" in the mouth. These\r\nbegin as red patches and streaks. The mucous membrane in such localities is\r\nconverted into a grayish-white slough, which, when shed, leaves a small\r\nerosion, or ulcer. At the same time similar changes may go on in the skin\r\nof the thighs, the udder, or the scrotum, or about the vagina, which lead\r\nto small sloughs.\r\n\r\nIn severe cases, which are the most common in the susceptible cattle of\r\nwestern Europe, death ensues four to seven days after the first appearance\r\nof the disease, and is preceded by great emaciation and debility, fetid,\r\npurulent discharges from the nose and mouth, and the relaxed rectum and\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\nAfter death, if the animal is opened and the organs carefully examined, the\r\nchief changes are found in the digestive organs. The lining membrane of the\r\nmouth and pharynx is covered with mucus, is reddened in spots, and shows\r\nsuperficial, yellowish-gray, cheesy patches, which represent dead tissue,\r\nand when removed expose ulcerated depressions. The same reddening in spots\r\nand the yellowish-gray, cheesy deposits or patches are found in the fourth\r\nstomach, the small intestines, and more rarely in the cecum, while the\r\nthird stomach, or manyplies, is more or less impacted with dry, hard feed.\r\nSimilar changes may be found on the mucous membrane of the nasal cavity,\r\nlarynx, trachea, the uterus, vagina, and rectum. The lungs may be injected,\r\nedematous, or pneumonic. The heart muscle is pale and flabby, and\r\nfrequently hemorrhages are observed in its internal membrane. The liver may\r\nbe pale or injected with blood, and at times shows hemorrhages beneath its\r\ncapsule. The bile is thin and watery in consistence. The kidneys may be\r\ninflamed or contain small hemorrhages within their substance or under the\r\ncapsule. The lymphatic glands may be swollen and injected or even\r\nhemorrhagic.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--On account of the danger of spreading the infection, neither\r\nmedicinal treatment nor inoculation is permitted in European countries,\r\nwith the exception of Russia, where the disease is more generally diffused.\r\nThe most effective method of exterminating rinderpest in those districts in\r\nwhich the disease is not indigenous has been found to be the slaughter of\r\nall affected and exposed animals. Where the disease is general, successful\r\nefforts adopted for its control have followed the immunization by\r\ninoculation of the exposed animals and a strict application of appropriate\r\nsanitary measures. This protective inoculation has been practiced with very\r\ngratifying results in Russia, South Africa, and in the Philippine Islands.\r\nAn active immunity is thus induced in susceptible animals which lasts until\r\nthe danger from exposure to the disease is over. This immunity may be\r\nattained (1) by the inoculation of pure bile from an animal which recently\r\ndied of rinderpest, (2) by the inoculation of glycerinated bile, followed\r\nby pure bile or virulent blood, or (3) by the simultaneous inoculation of\r\nstrong standardized serum and virulent blood.\r\n\r\nThe latter method has been adopted by the United States Government in its\r\nendeavor to exterminate the disease in the Philippines, and to protect the\r\ncattle and carabaos against rinderpest after their importation into those\r\nislands. Owing to the existence of this and other infectious diseases in\r\nthe Philippine Islands, an order has been issued by the Department of\r\nAgriculture prohibiting the landing of any live stock or animals of any\r\nkind from the Philippines at any of the ports of the United States or the\r\ndependencies thereof. This prohibition removes the greatest source of\r\ndanger to which the United States is exposed as the result of its\r\nintercourse with the islands. The introduction of rinderpest from those\r\ncountries from which we import animals is rendered extremely improbable,\r\nespecially in live animals, owing to its short period of incubation and to\r\nthe 90-day quarantine for cattle (counting from date of shipment) and\r\n15-day (counting from date of landing) quarantine for sheep and other\r\nruminants and swine which are at present enforced in the United States at\r\nall ports of entry.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.\r\n\r\n[Pl. XXXIII.]\r\n\r\nFoot-and-mouth disease, also known as aphthous fever, epizootic aphtha, and\r\neczema contagiosa, is an acute, highly communicable disease chiefly\r\nconfined to cloven-footed animals and characterized by an eruption of\r\nvesicles or blisters on the mucous membrane of the mouth and on the skin\r\nbetween the toes and above the hoofs. The vesicles rupture, forming\r\nerosions and ulcerations; there are also salivation, tenderness of the\r\naffected parts, loss of appetite, lameness, emaciation, and diminution in\r\nthe quantity of milk secreted.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous ravages of the disease are seen in the number and variety of\r\nthe species attacked. While it may be regarded as essentially a disease of\r\ncattle, hogs would seem to be as easy a prey. Almost in the same grade of\r\nreceptivity are sheep and goats. Next in order of susceptibility come the\r\nbuffalo, American bison, camel, chamois, llama, giraffe, and antelope.\r\nHorses, dogs, cats, and even poultry may occasionally become infected with\r\nthe disease, the last three being particularly dangerous as carriers of the\r\ncontagion. Man himself is not immune, and the frequency of his infection by\r\ncoming in contact with diseased animals is established by numerous\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nAs with other communicable diseases, the source and origin of\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease have given rise to much speculation. The disease\r\nhad been known in Europe for centuries, but it was not until comparatively\r\nrecent years that the erroneous conceptions of its spontaneous origin as a\r\nresult of climatic and meteorological conditions, exhausting journeys,\r\netc., were abandoned. It is now conceded that foot-and-mouth disease is\r\npropagated by a specific virus and that every outbreak starts from some\r\npreexisting outbreak.\r\n\r\nSo far investigators have been unable to identify or isolate the specific\r\norganism causing the disease, although numerous attempts have been made to\r\ncultivate and stain it by laboratory methods. Experiments have shown that\r\nthe virus will pass through standard germ-proof filters, thus indicating\r\nits minute size and the reason it has not been detected by the staining\r\nmethods. The contagion may be found in the serum of the vesicles on the\r\nmouth, feet, and udder; in the saliva, milk, and various secretions and\r\nexcretions; also in the blood during the rise of temperature.\r\n\r\nA wide distribution of the virus and a rapid infection of a herd is the\r\nresult. Animals may be infected directly, as by licking, and in calves by\r\nsucking, or indirectly by such things as infected manure, hay, utensils,\r\ndrinking troughs, railway cars, animal markets, barnyards, and pastures.\r\nHuman beings may carry the virus on their shoes and clothing and transmit\r\nit on their hands when milking, since the udder is occasionally the seat of\r\nthe eruption. It may also be carried by dogs, cats, rats, chickens,\r\npigeons, etc. Milk in a raw state may also transmit the disease to animals\r\nfed with it.\r\n\r\nThe observations made by some veterinarians would lead us to suppose that\r\nthe virus is quite readily destroyed. It is claimed that stables thoroughly\r\ncleaned become safe after drying for a short time; hence, litter of all\r\nkinds, such as manure or soiled hay and straw, may remain infective for a\r\nlonger time because they do not dry out. Other authorities maintain that\r\nthe virus is quite tenacious and may live in stables even so long as a\r\nyear. They also state that animals which have passed through the disease\r\nmay be a source of infection for several months after recovery.\r\n\r\nUnlike most other infectious diseases, foot-and-mouth disease may\r\nrepeatedly attack the same animals. The immunity conferred by an attack is\r\nof limited duration.\r\n\r\nThe period of incubation (that is, the time between the exposure of an\r\nanimal to infection and the development of the disease) is variable,\r\nusually from three to six days. The disease may appear in 24 hours, or, in\r\nexceptional cases, not for 18 days or even longer.\r\n\r\n_Losses._--The highly contagious character of foot-and-mouth disease and\r\nits rapid spread to practically all exposed susceptible animals lead to\r\nheavy losses. Since the mortality is comparatively low, ranging from only 3\r\nper cent or less in mild forms to 30 or 40 per cent in malignant cases, the\r\nhavoc caused by the pestilence is sometimes underestimated. But there are\r\nother sources of loss which are much more important than the actual\r\nmortality. The fever and the difficulty of eating cause a rapid and extreme\r\nloss in flesh and a lessening or cessation of the milk secretion. The\r\nudders often become inflamed and ruined by the formation of abscesses, and\r\ncows affected in this way are sometimes rendered permanently valueless for\r\nmilk production. The inflammation of the feet may cause the horn to drop\r\nfrom the toes, producing great lameness and lasting injury. Abortion is\r\nfrequent, and typical lesions have been observed in the newly born at\r\nbirth. Altogether these losses may amount to 20 or 30 per cent of the value\r\nof the affected animals.\r\n\r\nIn addition there are indirect losses of a commercial nature. Dairy farmers\r\nare put out of business for a time. Necessary quarantine restrictions\r\ngreatly interfere with the movement of live stock and such commodities as\r\nhay, straw, hides, and farm produce. The business of the stockyards and\r\nslaughtering centers is greatly interfered with. Sometimes it is necessary\r\nto close stockyards for disinfection. The whole business of marketing,\r\ntransporting, feeding, and slaughtering is interrupted and deranged. Losses\r\nof this character may reach enormous proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XXXIII. FOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The disease in other countries._--Foot-and-mouth disease has prevailed in\r\nEurope for a great many years and has occasioned tremendous economic losses\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, France, Switzerland, Germany, and Russia the plague has existed\r\nso long and has gained such a foothold that it is economically impossible\r\nto fight it with the American methods of slaughter and disinfection, for to\r\ndo so would kill a large percentage of the live stock of those countries.\r\nIn consequence, little or no progress toward eradication has been made by\r\nthe authorities, though the severity of the disease in France appears to\r\nhave abated somewhat in recent months.\r\n\r\nThe outbreak which appeared in Germany in 1888 increased steadily until\r\n1892, when it diminished gradually for a few years, but the disease again\r\nreached great proportions in 1899. Thereafter it continued to exist to a\r\ngreater or less extent until in 1911 it attained a virulence unequaled\r\nbefore. In that year 3,366,369 cattle, 1,602,927 sheep, 2,555,371 hogs, and\r\n53,674 goats were affected. At that time the total number of cattle, sheep,\r\nswine, and goats in Germany was only 51,319,000, while there were in the\r\nUnited States 172,572,000, or between three and four times as many. It can\r\nreadily be imagined, therefore, what it would mean to the United States if\r\nthe disease were to gain the foothold here that it had in Germany, where,\r\nas these figures show, approximately one out of seven of the animals\r\nsusceptible to the disease was affected.\r\n\r\nThe German Government, of course, has not left the disease to itself. It\r\nattempted to control some outbreaks by the method of slaughter, but the\r\npestilence had gained too much headway and was too firmly established in\r\ntoo many portions of the country for this method to succeed, and the\r\nslaughter of the infected herds had to be abandoned. It now appears that\r\nthere is no hope of getting rid of it until the virus has worn itself out.\r\nAs soon as the animals' period of acquired immunity is over and favorable\r\nconditions present themselves, the contagion breaks out with renewed\r\nvirulence. It has been impossible to control it by means of quarantines.\r\nOne scientist has asserted that unless all the infected farms were\r\nabsolutely isolated and the movement, not only of live stock but of\r\npersons, absolutely prohibited, the disease could not be stamped out. Such\r\na quarantine is, of course, utterly impossible to enforce. In portions of\r\nGermany the farmers, realizing that the disease is inevitable, make haste\r\nto be done with it by exposing their stock deliberately to mild cases in\r\nthe hope that this will result in an immediate, mild attack and immunity\r\nfor several years thereafter. Such immunity, however, is very uncertain.\r\n\r\nGreat Britain, Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, on account of their\r\ncomparatively isolated positions, have been more successful in keeping out\r\nthe disease. The outbreaks in those countries have been more sporadic, and\r\nby resorting to immediate slaughter the authorities have been able to stamp\r\nthem out. Great Britain has applied both quarantine and slaughter for many\r\nyears, and in an outbreak near Dublin in 1912 measures were adopted which\r\nwere even more stringent than any that have been used in the United States.\r\nA British official (Cope) asserted in 1899 that after his country's\r\nexperience with this disease it was \"more dreaded by the farmers and stock\r\nraisers of Great Britain than cattle plague or pleuropneumonia, and they\r\nare now willing and ready to put up with any restrictions, of however\r\ndrastic a character, considered necessary by the central department to\r\nstamp it out.\" The British authorities have succeeded in suppressing each\r\noutbreak, but reinfection often occurs from the neighboring continent. At\r\nthe present time (April, 1922) Great Britain is having a siege of the\r\ndisease, but is applying vigorous measures for its suppression.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1906, the disease reached Belgium from France, where it was\r\nquite prevalent, and by the end of the year every Province in Belgium was\r\naffected, and the Netherlands as well. Efforts to eradicate it from Belgium\r\nwere unavailing. The Netherlands apparently succeeded in stamping it out\r\nfor about six months, but it reappeared there.\r\n\r\nThe disease is also more or less prevalent in Central Europe, Spain, and in\r\nthe Balkan countries.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand have remained free from it.\r\n\r\nWe have less accurate information regarding Asia and Africa, but the\r\ndisease is known to prevail in Japan and China and in the Philippine\r\nIslands, and it is doubtful whether any considerable part of the Orient is\r\nfree from it.\r\n\r\nIn South America it is reported as common in Brazil, Argentina, and\r\nUruguay, and it probably exists in other countries.\r\n\r\nCanada and Mexico are fortunately free from the disease.\r\n\r\n_Outbreaks in the United States._--Foot-and-mouth disease has appeared in\r\nthe United States on six different occasions--1870, 1880, 1884, 1902, 1908,\r\nand 1914.\r\n\r\nAn extensive outbreak in 1870 was introduced by way of Canada, where the\r\ninfection was brought by an importation of cattle from Scotland. It spread\r\ninto the New England States and New York and appears to have been arrested\r\nwithin a few months. Its failure to spread more extensively and its early\r\ndisappearance have been ascribed to favorable conditions, such as the\r\nmovement of live stock from west to east, the limited trading at that\r\nperiod as compared with the present time, the restriction of traffic by\r\nwinter weather, and the infrequency of travel which obtained at that time\r\namong people.\r\n\r\nAbout 1880 two or three lots of animals affected by this disease were\r\nbrought to the United States, but there was no extension from the animals\r\noriginally affected.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, at Portland, Me., there was a small outbreak caused by imported\r\ncattle, and the disease spread to a few herds outside the quarantine\r\nstation. Owing to the small number of animals affected and the limited area\r\nof territory covered by the disease, it was easily controlled by the\r\nordinary measures of quarantine and disinfection.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that in all these early outbreaks the contagion was\r\nintroduced with imported animals. Since the development of a stringent\r\nsystem of inspection and quarantine of imported live stock, no instance of\r\nthat kind has occurred. On subsequent occasions the infection has evidently\r\nbeen brought in with contaminated products or materials and not by means of\r\nlive animals.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1902, the disease was discovered in Massachusetts and Rhode\r\nIsland. The earliest cases were traced to Chelsea, Mass., near the docks,\r\nand it was suspected for a time that the infection was brought in with\r\nforeign shipping, by some such means as hay, straw, halters, ropes, hides,\r\nhair, wool, etc. Later developments, however, and especially investigations\r\ninto the cause of the 1908 outbreak, led to the belief that a more probable\r\nsource of the infection was cowpox vaccine virus imported from a country\r\n(probably Japan) where foot-and-mouth disease existed, the vaccine virus\r\nbeing contaminated with the virus of foot-and-mouth disease.\r\n\r\nA Federal quarantine was declared by the Secretary of Agriculture on\r\nNovember 27, 1902, as soon as the nature of the disease was established,\r\nand steps for eradication were at once taken by the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry of the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with\r\nauthorities of the affected States. The methods followed consisted of\r\ninspection to trace and detect the disease, quarantine of infected premises\r\nand territory, slaughter and burial or burning of diseased and exposed\r\nanimals, and disinfection of premises.\r\n\r\nThis outbreak involved Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, and Rhode\r\nIsland, and was eradicated in about six months. Two hundred and forty-four\r\nherds, including 4,712 cattle, were found infected. Of these, 205 herds\r\nwith 3,872 cattle, as well as 360 hogs and 220 sheep and goats, were\r\nslaughtered. The cattle infected but not slaughtered were those that either\r\ndied or completely recovered before slaughtering could be carried out. The\r\nanimals slaughtered were valued at $184,155.10, and the Federal Government\r\nreimbursed owners to the extent of 70 per cent, or $128,908.57. It is\r\nunderstood that the States paid the remainder. The total cost to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture of stamping out the disease was about $300,000.\r\n\r\nThe next appearance of the foot-and-mouth disease was early in November,\r\n1908, when it was observed in cattle near Danville, Pa. A Federal\r\nquarantine was issued November 12. The infection was traced back to the\r\nstockyards at East Buffalo, N. Y., and to Detroit, Mich. The disease\r\nappeared in the States of Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. A\r\ncareful and thorough investigation made by Mohler of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry and Rosenau of the Public Health Service demonstrated that the\r\noutbreak started from calves used to propagate vaccine virus at an\r\nestablishment near Detroit, and that the source of the infection was\r\ncontaminated Japanese vaccine virus.\r\n\r\nVigorous measures of eradication similar to those employed in 1902-3 were\r\nat once put into effect and the disease was stamped out in about five\r\nmonths at an expense of about $300,000 to the Department of Agriculture,\r\nand of about $113,000 to the States. The inspectors made 108,683 visits to\r\nfarms, stockyards, etc., and inspected more than 1,500,000 animals\r\n(including reinspections). One hundred and fifty-seven premises were found\r\ninfected, and 3,636 animals (2,025 cattle, 1,329 hogs, and 282 sheep and\r\ngoats), valued at $90,033.18, were slaughtered. Owners were reimbursed for\r\nthe value of their animals and property destroyed, one-third being paid by\r\nthe States and two-thirds by the Federal Government.\r\n\r\nThe latest invasion was discovered in the vicinity of Niles, Mich., in\r\nOctober, 1914, after it had evidently been under way since August of the\r\nsame year. This is the most serious and extensive outbreak ever known in\r\nthis country. The disease extended to 22 States and the District of\r\nColumbia, at places ranging from the Atlantic to the Pacific coasts. The\r\nwork of eradication was not completed for more than a year. The affected\r\nStates were Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New\r\nHampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,\r\nVirginia, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin. Illinois had the\r\nlargest infected area and the largest number of animals affected. The Union\r\nStock Yards at Chicago became infected and were a source of dissemination\r\nof the contagion north, east, south, and west. These and other yards found\r\ninfected were closed temporarily and disinfected.\r\n\r\nThe first Federal quarantine was issued October 19, 1914. A campaign to\r\ncheck the spread of the disease and to stamp it out was immediately begun\r\nby the United States Department of Agriculture in cooperation with the\r\nState authorities. Quarantines against the movement of animals and certain\r\nmaterials from the infected areas were declared, shipments were traced,\r\nrumors investigated, and thorough inspections made in an effort to discover\r\nall infected stock. As measures of eradication, diseased herds were\r\nslaughtered and buried and the premises disinfected. The owners of live\r\nstock and other property destroyed on account of the disease were\r\nreimbursed to the extent of the appraised value, half of which is paid by\r\nthe Federal Government and half by the State. There were slaughtered\r\n172,720 animals (76,575 cattle, 86,492 swine, 9,511 sheep, 133 goats, and 9\r\ndeer), in 3,482 herds. The total appraised value of these animals was more\r\nthan $5,800,000. The expense to the Federal Government of eradicating this\r\noutbreak was about $4,540,000.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--In three to six days, or even longer, after the exposure of\r\nthe animal to the infection the disease makes its appearance. It is usually\r\nfirst indicated by the animal suffering from a chill, quickly followed by\r\nan invasion of fever, which may cause the temperature to rise as high as\r\n106∞ F. These symptoms are not always present, or may be in so slight a\r\nform as to escape notice. Following this in one or two days it will be\r\nnoticed that small vesicles or blisters about the size of hempseeds or peas\r\nare making their appearance upon the mucous membranes of the mouth at the\r\nborder and upper surface of the tongue near the tip, the inside of the\r\ncheeks, on the gums and the inner surface of the lips, or on the margin of\r\nthe dental pad. These little blisters contain a yellowish, watery fluid and\r\ngradually become more extensive as the disease advances. Soon after the\r\neruptions have appeared in the mouth of the animal considerable swelling,\r\nredness, and tenderness will be noticed about the feet, at the coronet, and\r\nbetween the digits of each foot. A day or two later eruptions similar to\r\nthose within the mouth make their appearance upon these swollen regions of\r\nthe foot, and at this stage it is usual to find that like lesions have made\r\ntheir appearance upon the perineum of the victim. In the case of milk cows\r\nthe udder, and more particularly the teats, show the same vesicular\r\neruption, but the latter as the result of milking soon become covered with\r\nreddened spots deprived of the superficial layer of skin and may develop\r\ndeep, obstinate fissures.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the disease has become well established the patient evinces pain\r\nwhen attempting to eat; in fact, the appetite is often so seriously\r\naffected that all feed is refused, and the animal uneasily opens and shuts\r\nits mouth with a characteristic smacking sound, while strings of cohesive,\r\nropy saliva hang suspended from the lips. With the advance of the disease\r\nthe vesicles widen and extend until they may reach a diameter ranging from\r\nthat of a dime to that of a silver dollar. These rupture soon after their\r\nappearance, sometimes on the first day, more rarely on the second or third\r\nday. After they have ruptured, the grayish-white membrane forming the\r\nblister may remain attached for a day or more, or disappear speedily and\r\nleave deeply reddened, sensitive spots or erosions, both within the mouth\r\nand upon the coronet and between the claws of the feet. Similar erosions,\r\nwhich quickly form scabs, as a rule, may be noticed in cases in which the\r\nteats of milk cows have become affected, and instances are reported in\r\nwhich sloughing of the tegument immediately around the lesions upon the\r\nudder has occurred. Owing to the tough, fibrous nature of the bovine skin,\r\nit is exceedingly rare for sloughing to occur upon any part of the body\r\nother than those mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe attack upon the feet of an animal is frequently manifested in all four\r\nfeet at once, but one or more of the feet may entirely escape and remain\r\nunaffected throughout the course of the disease. The ulceration of the\r\ninterdigital tissue may extend to the ligaments of the fetlock or produce\r\ndisease of the joint or bone. As the feet become sensitive and sore the\r\nanimal persistently lies down, and it has been found that bedsores develop\r\nwith amazing rapidity in all such cases and wholly baffle all attempts at\r\ntreatment until after the patient has regained its feet.\r\n\r\nThe disease may attack some of the internal organs before it appears upon\r\nany of the external tissues. These cases are very liable to prove quickly\r\nfatal. The animal dies from paralysis of the heart, due to the formation of\r\npoisonous principles within the system; it may suffocate by reason of the\r\naction of these same poisons upon the tissues of the lungs, or it may choke\r\nto death as a result of paralysis of the throat.\r\n\r\nIn cases of serious affection of the udder the erosions will often be found\r\nwithin the passages of the teats, resulting in a \"caked\" udder, and the\r\nsame toxic poisoning which is the cause of death in the apoplectiform types\r\njust mentioned may arise from this source. In any event the milk from such\r\ncases is dangerous for use, causing fatal diarrhea in sucking calves or\r\nyoung pigs and serious illness in human consumers. The milk obtained from\r\ncows suffering with foot-and-mouth disease is not readily converted into\r\neither butter or cheese, but remains thick, slimy, and inert in spite of\r\nchurning and attempts at curdling. Pregnant animals may abort. In pigs,\r\nsheep, and goats the lesions in the foot are most common, but both forms\r\nmay be observed or only the mouth lesions.\r\n\r\nWhen the disease has become fully established it will be found that the\r\nduration of the attack will vary greatly with different animals. From 10 to\r\n20 days are usually required for the recovery of the normal appetite and\r\nspirits in mild outbreaks, while the return to a full flow of milk, in the\r\ncase of milk cows, seldom occurs before the arrival of the following\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nIn the malignant type of the disease it requires from three months to a\r\nyear for an animal to recover. The mortality, as already stated, is usually\r\nlow. The disease is more fatal in young animals that have been fed on\r\ninfected milk, and produces death in from 60 to 80 per cent of these cases\r\nas a result of gastroenteritis. In the 1914 outbreak numerous new centers\r\nof infection started among hogs and calves which were fed on unpasteurized,\r\ninfected milk from creameries.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--The recognition of this affection should not, as a rule, be\r\ndifficult, especially when the disease is known to be in the vicinity; in\r\nfact, the group of symptoms form a clinical picture too decided to be\r\ndoubted. The combination of high fever, vesicular inflammation of the\r\nmouth, and hot, painful, swollen condition of the feet, followed 24 to 48\r\nhours later by the appearance of numerous blisters varying in size from\r\nthat of a pea to that of a walnut on the udder and feet and in the mouth\r\nshould prevent any serious or long-continued error in the diagnosis;\r\nhowever, in the inoculation of calves we have a certain and final test. In\r\n24 to 96 hours after inoculation the calves present the characteristic\r\nblisters. Such inoculation should be practiced, however, only by officials\r\nproperly authorized to deal with contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--The lesions of no other disease of cattle\r\nclosely simulate the vesicular eruption of foot-and-mouth disease on the\r\nlining membrane of the mouth. When the blisters have ruptured, however, and\r\nthe resulting lesions have become contaminated by numerous secondary forms\r\nof microorganisms, the correct recognition of the disease may be involved\r\nin considerable difficulty.\r\n\r\nCowpox or horsepox may be accidentally transmitted by inoculation. But the\r\neruption of the \"pox\" goes on to the development of a pustule, while in\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease the eruption is never more than a vesicle, even\r\nthough the contained fluid may become turbid. The inoculation test in the\r\ncase of cowpox does not respond with fever and eruption for at least 10\r\ndays, and often longer.\r\n\r\nNecrotic stomatitis (sore mouth due to a germ) may be distinguished from\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease by the fact that in the latter there is a rapid\r\ninfection of the entire herd, including the adult cattle, as well as the\r\ninfection of hogs and sheep. The characteristic lesion of foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease is the appearance of blisters containing a serous fluid upon the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and upon the udder, teats, and feet of the\r\naffected animals. In necrotic stomatitis blisters are never formed,\r\ndestruction of the tissues occurring from the beginning and being followed\r\nby the formation of yellowish, cheesy patches, principally found involving\r\nthe lining membrane of the mouth, especially the tongue and cheeks.\r\n\r\nIn mycotic stomatitis (sore mouth due to a fungus or mold), portions of the\r\nlining membrane become inflamed and in a few days it changes to a croupous\r\nmembrane which peels off, leaving a raw surface, while the thin skin\r\nbetween the toes may also be inflamed. The previous history of the case;\r\nthe failure of the blisters, if any appear, to spread extensively; the\r\nabsence of vesicular eruptions on other portions of the body, notably the\r\nudder and teats, and, characteristically, the hoof, together with the\r\nabsence of rapid spread to practically all cattle in the herd and the\r\ncomplete negative character of inoculation of calves, distinguish between\r\nthe local disease named and foot-and-mouth disease. Mycotic stomatitis\r\noccurs in only from 10 to 50 per cent of the animals in a herd, usually in\r\nthe late summer or early fall after a dry spell, and it does not run a\r\nregular course.\r\n\r\nThe lesion, resulting from ergotism may be distinguished from those of\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease by the lack of eruptions in the mouth and by the\r\nlocation of the disease at the tips of the ears, end of the tail, or upon\r\nthe lower part of the legs, usually below the knees or hocks. The lesion of\r\nergotism does not take the form of pustules or blisters, but manifests\r\nitself first as a swelling about the ankle, which later may slough and\r\ncircumscribe the limb, forming a deep crack, extending entirely around the\r\nlimb and forming a distinct line of demarcation between the healthy skin\r\nabove and the diseased below. The absence of ulcerous sores on the coronet\r\nand between the claws, together with the healthy condition of the membranes\r\nof the mouth and the knowledge that the lesion upon the limb in question\r\nextends uninterruptedly around it, should point conclusively to a diagnosis\r\nof ergotism and to the exclusion of all fears of foot-and-mouth disease.\r\n\r\nIn foul foot or ground itch of cattle, the inflammation of the skin and\r\ntoes is general and not in certain spots, as in foot-and-mouth disease. The\r\nmouth remains unaffected, and the presence of the disease may be traced to\r\nfilth and poor drainage.\r\n\r\nThe severer forms of the disease might be confounded with certain general\r\ndiseases. If gastrointestinal symptoms predominate, acute gastric catarrh\r\nor inflammation of the intestines might be thought of. Involvement of the\r\nlungs may lead to a diagnosis of acute congestion of the lungs or\r\npneumonia. The distinction is apparent in these diseases by the lack of\r\nvesicular eruption on the mucous membrane or skin, and also by lack of\r\nevidences of infection in the herd or neighboring animals.\r\n\r\n_Prevention and eradication._--The measures to be adopted to prevent the\r\nspread of the affection must take into consideration the highly infectious\r\nnature of the disease, its ease of dissemination, and the liability of the\r\nvirus to live for long periods outside the body of an animal. Great care\r\nshould therefore be observed in keeping healthy animals unexposed to the\r\ncontagion. When an outbreak occurs in a community the owner should make\r\nevery effort to keep other animals from coming in contact with his diseased\r\ncattle. This especially applies to dogs, cats, goats, and poultry, which\r\nusually have access to the stables and barnyards and in this way furnish\r\nexcellent means for disseminating the infectious principle. He should be\r\nequally particular in prohibiting any person from coming onto his premises,\r\nespecially an attendant or owner or other person in any way connected with\r\ncattle. Such a herd may be placed under quarantine, with an inspector\r\nappointed to keep the premises under constant surveillance.\r\n\r\nThis method of quarantine alone, while very satisfactory in many instances,\r\nis rather tardy in obtaining the desired result. The experience of European\r\nGovernments already mentioned shows that eradication by this method alone,\r\nwhen the disease has obtained a foothold, is practically impossible. For\r\nthis reason, when the disease breaks out in a country like the United\r\nStates, where the contagion is likely to spread rapidly by means of\r\ninfected cars, manure, hay, and other feed, and where the results of its\r\nobtaining a firm foothold would be so disastrous, it seems that this method\r\nof temporizing is rather tedious, and more radical steps are required in\r\norder to suppress and eradicate completely the infection in the quickest\r\nand most thorough manner possible.\r\n\r\nIt would therefore appear better, after judicious appraisement, to\r\nconcentrate the expense incident to the extermination of foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease by purchasing and slaughtering all affected and exposed cattle. The\r\ncarcasses of these animals should be totally destroyed, preferably by\r\ncremation, or otherwise by burying them in a hole 6 feet deep and covering\r\nthem with air-slaked lime. The infected stable should be disinfected by\r\nthoroughly cleaning it, scrubbing the floor with hot water, brushing down\r\nall loose dust from the walls, and tearing off all woodwork which is partly\r\ndecayed. Then the whole interior of the stable should be disinfected with\r\none of the following substances:\r\n\r\n  A 5 per cent solution of pure carbolic acid.\r\n\r\n  Chlorid of lime, U. S. P. strength (30 per cent available chlorin), 1\r\n    pound to 3 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n  Formaldehyde, 1 quart 40 per cent solution to 5 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n  A 3 per cent solution of cresol compound, U. S. P., or accepted\r\n    substitute therefor, containing at least 50 per cent cresylic acid.\r\n\r\nAll stable utensils should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected by the\r\napplication of a solution of one of the above-named disinfectants. The\r\nmanure should be burned or disinfected and spread over ground (other than\r\nmeadow land) that is to be turned under. No other cattle should be\r\npurchased for at least sixty days after the complete disinfection of the\r\npremises.\r\n\r\nThe success in eradicating the disease by combined quarantine, slaughter,\r\nand disinfection, as practiced in the United States, Denmark, Great\r\nBritain, and a few other countries, demonstrates in a striking manner the\r\nefficacy of slaughtering and the futility of relying upon quarantine alone\r\nto stamp out the disease.\r\n\r\nInoculation has been adopted in some countries in order to have the disease\r\nspread quickly through the herds, and while this practice has undoubted\r\nvalue where the disease is indigenous, it is not desirable in this country\r\nand should not be adopted.\r\n\r\nAs a rule medicinal treatment with a view of curing affected animals is not\r\nto be recommended under conditions prevailing in the United States, where\r\nthe disease has not become established, and the first object is to stamp it\r\nout as quickly as possible. Even though most animals would recover, with or\r\nwithout treatment, it would be practically impossible, while they were\r\nbeing held for recovery, to prevent the spread of the infection to others.\r\nThe disease would be liable to spread faster than it could be cured. As\r\nalready pointed out, it has been found impossible to prevent absolutely the\r\nspread of the contagion by the strictest quarantine alone, under the usual\r\nfarm conditions. In addition, the affected animals that have passed through\r\nthe disease may become a source of further infection as virus carriers for\r\nweeks and months after they have apparently recovered, and are susceptible\r\nof reinfection, as one attack does not confer permanent immunity.\r\n\r\n_Foot-and-mouth disease in man._--Foot-and-mouth disease is primarily and\r\nprincipally a disease of cattle; secondarily and casually, a disease of\r\nman. It is transmissible to man through the eating or drinking of raw milk,\r\nbuttermilk, butter, cheese, and whey from animals suffering from\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease. It is also transmitted directly, though more\r\nrarely, from the salivary secretions or other infected material which may\r\ngain entrance through the mucous membrane of the mouth. It is doubtful\r\nwhether the disease can be transmitted to man by cutaneous or subcutaneous\r\ninoculation, though it is probable that the infection may be communicated\r\nif the virus directly enters the blood through wounds of any kind. Children\r\nare not infrequently infected by drinking unboiled milk during the periods\r\nin which the disease is prevalent in the neighborhood, while persons in\r\ncharge of diseased animals may become infected through contact with the\r\ndiseased parts or by milking, slaughtering, or caring for the animals.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms in man resemble those observed in animals. There is fever,\r\nsometimes vomiting, painful swallowing, heat and dryness of the mouth,\r\nfollowed by an eruption of vesicles on the mucous membrane of the mouth,\r\nand very rarely by similar ones on the fingers. The vesicles appear on the\r\nlips, gums, cheek, and edge of the tongue, and are about the size of a pea.\r\nThe vesicles soon rupture, leaving a small erosion which is soon covered by\r\na thin crust under which the new formation of epithelium proceeds rapidly.\r\nThe skin eruption mostly appears on the hands, tips of the fingers, base of\r\nthe nails, and more seldom on the toes and other parts of the body. Besides\r\nthese local changes, during the course of the disease headache, pain in the\r\nlimbs, vertigo, abdominal cramps, vomiting, diarrhea, and weakness are\r\noccasionally observed. The disease is seldom fatal, usually appearing in a\r\nvery mild form except in weakened children, in whom an accompanying\r\nintestinal catarrh may lead to a fatal termination.\r\n\r\nVeterinarians who have had considerable experience with the disease among\r\nanimals regard the human affection as by no means uncommon in countries\r\nwhere foot-and-mouth disease prevails, but the disturbance of health is\r\nusually too slight to come to the notice of the family physician.\r\n\r\nBut few outbreaks of the disease in man have occurred in the United States,\r\nand therefore cases of its transmission to man in this country are rather\r\nrare. Dr. James Law reports having observed the disease in man from\r\ndrinking infected milk during the epizootic of 1870 in the Eastern States,\r\nbut the outbreaks of 1880 and 1884 affected such a small number of animals\r\nand were so quickly suppressed that no instance of its transmission to man\r\nwas recorded. A few cases have been reported by Brush accompanying the New\r\nEngland outbreak of 1902. Similar reports have been likewise received\r\nconcerning the appearance of vesicular eruptions in the mouths of children\r\nduring the 1908 and 1914 outbreaks, and the history of these cases\r\nincriminates the milk supply.\r\n\r\nExperiments by Loeffler and Froesch, as well as recent experiments which\r\nhave been made in Denmark and Germany, indicate that the infection is\r\ncomparatively easy to destroy by heat or the usual antiseptics. Milk\r\npasteurized at a temperature of 60∞ C. for 20 minutes is safe so far as\r\ninfection by foot-and-mouth disease is concerned.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTICEMIA AND PYEMIA.\r\n\r\nThese two names are applied to diseased conditions which are so nearly\r\nalike in their symptoms that it is sometimes difficult to distinguish the\r\none from the other. Indeed, the name pyosepticemia, or septicopyemia, is\r\noften applied when it is impossible to make a distinction between\r\nsepticemia and pyemia or where each is equally responsible for the diseased\r\ncondition. The name septicemia is derived from two Greek words meaning\r\n\"poison\" and \"blood,\" and signifies that the germ lives in the blood, hence\r\nthe use of the term \"blood poisoning\" for this disease. Pyemia is likewise\r\nderived from two Greek words, meaning \"pus\" and \"blood,\" and is that form\r\nof septicemia caused by pus-producing organisms and characterized by\r\nsecondary abscesses.\r\n\r\n_Causes._--Neither of these diseases is brought about, strictly speaking,\r\nby any specific organism; hence neither can be looked upon as a specific\r\ndisease. The organisms most frequently found in cases of septicemia are, on\r\nthe whole, the same as those of pyemia, and may be pus cocci, the bacillus\r\ncoli, or other pus-producing organisms. These organisms are often found as\r\nsecondary invaders in other diseases, such as advanced cases of\r\ntuberculosis, in which cases they are responsible for the formation of pus.\r\n\r\nAside from the causative organism, or, in other words, the active cause,\r\nthere are many secondary causes. The most important of these in pyemia is a\r\nbreak in continuity of the protective covering, as a wound, which affords\r\nan entrance into the tissues for the organisms. Among the different\r\nvarieties of wounds may be mentioned cuts, bruises, punctures, burns,\r\nchemical or frozen wounds, and compound fractures of bones. Injuries\r\nreceived during parturition, stoppage of the milk ducts, and infection of\r\nthe umbilicus in the newly born are also frequent causes of pyemia.\r\nSepticemia usually follows surgical wounds, local suppuration, enteritis,\r\nbronchitis--in fact, wherever there is a local lesion of any kind\r\npermitting germs to enter the blood. Septicemia was formerly applied to\r\ndesignate the condition in which the organisms were localized, but in which\r\ntheir toxins were diffused in the blood. Pyemia was made to represent that\r\ncondition when the organisms were localized, but in which the pus was\r\ntransported by the blood. These terms now are applied to conditions in\r\nwhich both the organisms and their toxins, or the pus, are present in the\r\nblood. The term septicemia is indicated when intoxication is the more\r\npronounced symptom and pyemia if pus formation and metastatic or secondary\r\nabscess formation are observed.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms of both diseases include primarily a high fever\r\n(104∞ to 107∞ F.). Coupled with this there is disinclination to move, the\r\nanimal is depressed and not cognizant of its surroundings. The pulse is\r\nrapid, small, and feeble, respiration increased, mucous membrane injected,\r\nswollen, and of a yellowish tinge. Appetite is lost and death follows in\r\nthe case of septicemia in from two to four days. In pyemia the symptoms\r\ncome on more slowly and are not so intense as in septicemia, while the\r\ncourse of the disease is longer, lasting from six days to four weeks. The\r\nmortality is not so great as in septicemia, but the period of convalescence\r\nis always long.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--Septicemia is characterized by the destructive changes in the\r\nblood, which is chocolate colored, noncoagulable, and swarms with bacteria.\r\nThe lining membranes of the heart are studded with red spots, often running\r\ntogether to form a large hemorrhagic area. The lungs, liver, and kidneys\r\nmay also show these hemorrhages. The spleen is enlarged and full of black\r\nblood. The cadaver decomposes very rapidly and in some cases forms great\r\nquantities of fetid gas. In pyemia, in addition to these lesions, abscesses\r\nare formed in the various organs throughout the body. If the disease\r\ndevelops slowly a post-mortem examination shows the abscesses to be the\r\nchief alterations. The pus content is usually greenish, stained with blood,\r\nand contains strings of fibrous tissue and necrosed matter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is almost futile in advanced cases of either\r\ndisease. Septicemia is usually fatal and pyemia frequently so. Prevention\r\nand the immediate treatment of local infections are the surest means of\r\ncombating them. For local treatment of wounds the usual antiseptics are\r\nindicated, such as 3 per cent compound cresol or carbolic acid, or one\r\none-thousandth bichlorid-of-mercury solution. For pyemia, where the\r\nabscesses are near the skin, they should be opened and treated\r\nantiseptically by injecting any of the previously mentioned germicides.\r\nGeneral and heart stimulants are indicated, such as a drench containing\r\ndigitalis 2 drams and alcohol 2 ounces. Quinin and calomel in repeated\r\nsmall doses of one-half dram each three times a day are sometimes\r\nbeneficial. Camphor in the form of oil of camphor (camphor dissolved in\r\n10 parts of sweet oil) is a good stimulant and has some antiseptic\r\nproperties, which make it a valuable drug in combating these diseases\r\nwhen it is given in doses of 2 drams three times daily.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGIC SEPTICEMIA.\r\n\r\nHemorrhagic septicemia is a name applied to a highly fatal, infectious\r\ndisease existing in various species of domestic and wild animals, from a\r\nmicroorganism having definite biological characters and possessing the\r\nproperties of producing clearly defined and characteristic lesions.\r\n\r\nThis causal agent, _Bacterium bovisepticum_, belongs to the same group of\r\ncocco-bacilli as those causing chicken cholera, swine plague, and rabbit\r\nsepticemia, and may be described as an ovoid, nonmotile, polar-staining\r\nbacterium with rounded ends, 1/38000 of an inch wide by 1/20000 of an inch\r\nlong, sometimes seen in pairs and sometimes in chains.\r\n\r\nVarious names have been applied to this disease, and though the causative\r\nagent and the distinctive lesions are well known, it is more than likely\r\nthat the affection is seldom recognized. It was described by Bollinger in\r\n1878, and named Wild und Rinderseuche, from its having affected deer, wild\r\nboars, cattle, and horses in an epizootic which swept over Germany at that\r\ntime. Before this, however, several epizootics of what was evidently the\r\nsame disease had been well described, notably that which occurred in\r\nEngland in 1854. Since then it has occurred in epizootic and enzootic forms\r\nin many sections of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. In this country the\r\ndisease has been observed in Texas, Tennessee, New York, Minnesota,\r\nPennsylvania, District of Columbia, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Other\r\nnames given to it are game and cattle disease, buffalo disease, barbone,\r\npasteurellosis bovina, ghotwa, and infectious pneumoenteritis.\r\n\r\nIn earlier times it was evidently confounded with gloss anthrax, and even\r\nnow it is probably mistaken in a great many instances for anthrax,\r\nblackleg, cornstalk disease, and cerebrospinal meningitis.\r\n\r\nThe disease is essentially a septicemia, or blood poisoning, and the\r\nmicrobic invasion occurs from inoculation probably either through abrasions\r\nof the skin or by injury to the mucous membranes from coarse fodder, etc.\r\nMoore and Smith have found in the mouths and nasal cavities of healthy\r\nanimals, including cattle, bacteria belonging to this group; but these\r\norganisms proved to be nonpathogenic. As is well known, however, many\r\npathogenic germs at times exist in a saprophytic state, and it is not hard\r\nto conceive how a microbe may cease such existence and assume parasitic or\r\npathogenic properties when the surroundings are eminently favorable. This\r\nmay be a connecting link in the etiology of sporadic outbreaks of the\r\ndisease in which all other hypotheses as to its genesis seem untenable. The\r\ndisease seems to occur most frequently in swampy or mucky localities or in\r\npastures receiving the overflow from infected fields. It is said to occur\r\nusually in the spring of the year, when the melting snows and rains bring\r\nto the surface the subterranean waters from rich soils containing\r\nnitrogenous materials in which the bacteria have been existing. In a great\r\nmany instances there does not seem to be any plausible explanation for an\r\noutbreak of the disease and one can only surmise as to its origin.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Three forms of the disease are recognized, based upon the\r\ndistribution of the lesions--the superficial, or cutaneous, the pectoral,\r\nor thoracic, and the intestinal form. The last is a usual accompaniment of\r\nthe other two and may be mild or severe. Naturally the symptoms vary\r\naccording to the violence of the attack and to the particular form of\r\ndisease with which the animal is affected. In the superficial, or\r\ncutaneous, form the presence of a swollen tongue, throat, and dewlap, or\r\neven of the lower portion of the legs, gives us a clew to the trouble. An\r\nentire loss of appetite occurs, and in milk cows there is a diminution of\r\nthe milk secretion. The temperature may be only slightly elevated, but it\r\nis usually very high. Salivation is set up by the inflammation of the mouth\r\nand pharynx. Unsuccessful efforts at eating and swallowing are made. There\r\nmay be difficulty in breathing, depending on the amount of involvement of\r\nthe larynx, trachea, bronchi, or lungs. There may be a blood-stained\r\ndischarge from the nostrils, and the mucous membrane thereof will often\r\nshow punctiform hemorrhages. The pulmonary form shows the same symptoms as\r\ncroupous pneumonia, with a frequent suffocative cough and oppressed\r\nbreathing, or dyspnea. When the intestines are involved the patient strains\r\nto defecate, and passes shreds of intestinal mucus along with blood-stained\r\nfeces. The urine also may be tinged with blood. Finally a severe diarrhea\r\ntakes place, the animal becomes correspondingly weak, and death takes place\r\nin 24 to 36 hours. Cases may die in as short a period as six to eight\r\nhours, while in the pectoral form of the disease the animal may linger six\r\nor eight days. Cases have been reported which became chronic and in which\r\ndeath did not take place for a month or more. In some of the cases running\r\nan acute course, symptoms of toxemia are present; there is a lack of\r\nsensation of the skin, staggering gait, trembling, eyes fixed, neck at\r\ntimes bent to one side, and the eyes showing a wild expression. At times\r\nthe animals appear as if in pain and look around at the flanks. In the\r\npectoral form they may stand with the forelegs wide apart in evident effort\r\nto breathe more freely. Sometimes there is a champing of the jaws and a\r\nvery free flow of glairy saliva dropping from the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe prognosis is decidedly unfavorable and 80 to 90 per cent of the cases\r\nresult fatally.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--The characteristic lesions of hemorrhagic septicemia consist of\r\nhemorrhagic areas in the subcutaneous, subserous, and muscular tissues, the\r\nlymph glands, and the viscera; in fact, they are distributed more or less\r\nwidely throughout the body and vary in size from a mere speck to the\r\ndiameter of a half dollar or even larger. The superficial form presents\r\nitself first as a doughy tumefaction of the skin about the region of the\r\nthroat, neck, dewlap, or legs, which pits on pressure. This tumefaction\r\nconsists essentially of a cerogelatinous exudate into the subcutaneous and\r\nintermuscular tissues.\r\n\r\nBloody extravasations may take place in subcutaneous tissues in various\r\nplaces, but they are usually seen about the lower portion of the neck. The\r\nmucous membranes and submucous tissues of the mouth, tongue, pharynx, and\r\nlarynx become involved in the process and are greatly thickened, inflamed,\r\nand infiltrated with serum. The mucous membrane becomes reddish purple, and\r\nthat of the nostrils may in addition show hemorrhagic spots on its surface.\r\nThe lymphatic glands in this region are also swollen and infiltrated with\r\nbloody serum. The salivary glands are pale and dry. The pectoral type,\r\nthough at times existing alone, may coexist with the cutaneous form. The\r\ninflammatory edema of the mouth extends to the mucous membrane of the\r\ntrachea and bronchi, producing an extensive thickening and a yellowish\r\ninfiltration. The lung shows interstitial thickening from the outpouring of\r\nserum into its meshes. It may become pneumonic.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm, heart sac, and heart walls show numerous hemorrhagic points\r\nand larger bloody extravasations. Sometimes there is a serous pleurisy,\r\nwith more or less fibrinous exudate. In the intestinal form the submucous\r\nand subperitoneal tissues show alterations from a few hemorrhagic spots to\r\nlarge bloody suffusions, or even gelatinous infiltrations. This latter is\r\nseen about the region of the pancreas and in the folds of the mesentery.\r\nThere is a severe hemorrhagic inflammation of the intestines and a staining\r\nof the intestinal contents with blood. The muscular system throughout shows\r\nhemorrhagic areas. The abdominal viscera, liver, spleen, and kidneys often\r\npresent hemorrhagic lesions.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--Anthrax, which presents superficial swellings,\r\nlike hemorrhagic septicemia, may be distinguished from that affection on\r\npost-mortem examination by the enlargement and engorgement of the spleen,\r\nthe contents of which are soft and tarry. The blood of anthrax animals is\r\nvery dark, and does not become light red on exposure to air, nor does it\r\ncoagulate, while in hemorrhagic septicemia the blood is normal in\r\nappearance and coagulates. The detection of the anthrax bacillus in the\r\nblood would be final.\r\n\r\nIn blackleg the animals affected are usually under 2 years of age. The\r\nswellings are quite evident, and usually occur on the legs, above the knees\r\nor hocks, and are distended with gas, which crackles, or crepitates, when\r\npressed upon. If one of these tumors is opened, a bloody serum will exude,\r\nand the gas gives off the odor of rancid butter. The internal hemorrhages\r\nare not general, although they may occur. A microscopic examination of the\r\njuices from the tumefaction will show the blackleg bacillus.\r\n\r\nIn cerebrospinal meningitis the causative agent is unknown, but probably\r\nexists in the feed. It may occur in any locality and at any season of the\r\nyear. There are no local swellings, and cattle are not frequently affected.\r\n\r\nCornstalk disease may be differentiated from this affection from the fact\r\nthat it always occurs after the cattle are turned into a cornstalk field,\r\nby its sudden onset, the absence of any characteristic symptoms or\r\npost-mortem lesions, and the failure to find the causative agent in the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\nIn making a post-mortem examination of animals affected with hemorrhagic\r\nsepticemia, it would be well to examine the articular surfaces of the long\r\nbones, as it has been reported that they are frequently ulcerated. This\r\nshould apply especially to those cases that have shown lameness.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is absolutely useless, so far as we know at\r\npresent, and for all practical purposes prophylaxis alone should be relied\r\nupon. The same sanitary precautions, such as isolation, disinfection, and\r\nburial or burning of all dead carcasses, should be observed as for anthrax\r\nand other highly infectious diseases. All the premises, barns, stalls,\r\nlitter, and stable utensils should be thoroughly disinfected. Separate the\r\napparently well animals from the sick by placing them in a separate lot.\r\n\r\nExperiments by the Bureau of Animal Industry toward protective inoculation\r\nof the exposed cattle on infected premises have been made and the results\r\nhave been so satisfactory that several commercial houses handling\r\nbiological products are manufacturing a vaccine for hemorrhagic septicemia\r\nin accordance with the Government's experiments on this subject. The method\r\nof preparing the vaccine is similar to that recommended by LigniËres. It\r\nconsists in growing the cultures of the organism of the disease at 42 to\r\n43∞ C. and preparing from them growing at this temperature two different\r\nstrengths of vaccine. The weaker vaccine, which is used for the first\r\ninjection, is grown for five days at this temperature, whereas the stronger\r\nvaccine, for the second injection, is grown for only two days. These\r\nvaccines are used with an interval of 10 days between the injections, the\r\ndose being 1 cubic centimeter at each injection. The effect of this vaccine\r\nin abating outbreaks already in progress has been highly satisfactory and\r\nit is plain that the general introduction of preventive vaccination for\r\nhemorrhagic septicemia must be of material benefit to the cattle raisers in\r\nthe infected districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESICULAR ERUPTION OF THE GENITAL ORGANS.\r\n\r\nThis contagious disease is called coital exanthema or vesicular exanthema,\r\nand is more or less prevalent on the Continent. It has also been observed\r\nin the breeding districts of the United States. It is the subject of\r\nlegislation in Germany, and governmental statistics are published annually\r\nconcerning its distribution in the Empire. According to the reports from\r\nHungary 492 head of cattle were attacked during 1898, 587 in 1899, and 207\r\nin 1900.\r\n\r\nA similar or perhaps identical disease of horses has the same distribution\r\nand is transmissible from horses to cattle and vice versa.\r\n\r\nThe disease may be defined as a highly contagious eruption situated upon\r\nthe external genital organs of both sexes and accompanied with little or no\r\ngeneral disturbance of health. The contagion, the nature of which remains\r\nstill unknown, is transmitted mainly during copulation. The bull may have\r\nthe disease and convey it to all the cows with which he comes in contact,\r\nor he may become infected by one cow, and, although not showing the\r\ndisease, he may, during copulation, transmit it for several days after to\r\nall other cows. Simple contact between one cow and another may convey the\r\ndisease, or the sponges used in cleaning the diseased may carry the virus\r\nto the healthy. It has also been conveyed to healthy cows by these animals\r\nlying with their hind quarters against infected wooden troughs.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The period between the infection and the appearance of\r\nsymptoms is somewhat variable. It is usually given as three to six days. It\r\nmay be briefer or much longer. In cows the mucous membrane of the vagina\r\nand the vulva become swollen, inflamed, very tender, and covered with\r\ndark-red spots. The secretion is very abundant and consists at first\r\nlargely of serum and mucus resembling the white of an egg. Small vesicles\r\nthen appear, which rapidly burst and are converted into excoriations or\r\ndeeper ulcerations. The secretion becomes more purulent and is apt to dry\r\nin crusts about the root of the tail. The eruption is accompanied with much\r\nitching and difficulty in urinating. The walk may be stiff and awkward. In\r\nbulls the eruption is situated on the prepuce and the end of the penis, and\r\nconsists of pimples, vesicles, and ulcers, as in cows. It is accompanied\r\nwith a little purulent discharge from the prepuce, itching, and difficulty\r\nin urinating. In severe cases the inflammation and swelling may extend\r\nbackward to the scrotum and forward upon the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe disease lasts from one to four weeks and always terminates in recovery.\r\nThe acute stage lasts only four or five days, while the complete healing of\r\nthe inflammation is slow. The eruption is usually accompanied with very\r\nlittle general disturbance. If the pain and irritation are severe, there\r\nmay be some light loss of appetite and diminished milk secretion in cows.\r\nThe disease rarely causes abortion. Chronic catarrh of the vagina and\r\npermanent sterility frequently follow as sequelÊ.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ need not be resorted to excepting in severe cases. The\r\nsecretion and exudation should be washed off and a mild antiseptic applied,\r\nsuch as a 1 per cent solution of carbolic acid (1 ounce to 3 quarts of\r\nwater) or 2 per cent solution of cresol compound in water. Care must be\r\ntaken not to carry the disease from the sick to the well by sponges, etc.,\r\nwhich have come in contact with the affected organs. These should be\r\ndestroyed. To prevent the spread of the disease the infected animals should\r\nbe kept isolated until they have recovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nRABIES OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\nRabies is a disease preeminently affecting the canine race, although all\r\nwarm-blooded animals, including man, are susceptible to the malady, which\r\nis always communicated through bites from a preceding case. It has required\r\nmany years of patient, scientific research to lead the ablest investigators\r\nto a clear comprehension of the cause, nature, and characteristics of this\r\naffection. It was known and described several centuries prior to the\r\nbeginning of the Christian era, and from the earliest dawn of history it\r\nhas been feared and dreaded. Its terrible manifestations have always been\r\nsurrounded with an atmosphere of awe and mystery, and it is not surprising\r\nthat myths, fallacies, and misconceptions in regard to it have been common\r\nand widely accepted. As the investigations by which we have come to a\r\ntolerably clear understanding of the facts concerning rabies have been\r\ncomparatively recent, and for the most part, have appeared in scientific\r\nperiodicals, fallacies in regard to the disease continue to have a strong\r\nhold upon the public mind. For instance, it is still a widely prevalent\r\nbelief that if persons or animals are bitten by a dog they are liable to\r\nbecome rabid if the dog should contract the disease at any future time.\r\nThere is no foundation for this impression, and it would be a great comfort\r\nto many people who are now and then bitten by animals if the fallacy of\r\nthis idea were known. All experience, both scientific and practical, goes\r\nto show that rabies is transmitted only by animals that are actually\r\ndiseased at the time the bite is inflicted. Rabies is an infectious disease\r\ninvolving the nervous system and characterized by extreme excitability and\r\nother nervous disorders and always terminating in death. The contagion of\r\nthis disease has never been isolated, but the fact that it is caused by a\r\nspecific organism principally found in the nervous system is indisputable.\r\nFor instance, if an emulsion of the brain of a rabid animal is filtered\r\nthrough a germ-proof filter, the filtrate will be harmless. This fact\r\nindicates that the infectious principle is not in solution, but is an\r\norganism withheld from the filtrate by the filter. This contagion can be\r\npropagated only in the body of an animal. It is transmitted naturally from\r\none animal to another solely by bites, and the old idea of spontaneous\r\nappearance of the disease is absolutely fallacious. It may be produced\r\nartificially by inoculating susceptible animals with an emulsion of the\r\nbrain or spinal cord, as well as the saliva, milk, and other secretions of\r\nthe affected animal. The blood, on the contrary, seems to be free from the\r\ninfectious principle. The saliva contains the virus, which, under natural\r\nconditions, is introduced into or under the skin on the tooth of the rabid\r\nanimal. The disease is widespread, being found in many countries of Europe,\r\nAsia, and Africa, and in certain sections of the United States.\r\n\r\nOwing to the rigid quarantine regulations enforced against dogs imported\r\ninto Australia, that country remains absolutely free from the disease.\r\nFollowing the canine race, cattle seem to be the most frequently affected,\r\nprobably because rabid dogs, next to their morbid desire to attack other\r\nmembers of their own race, have a better opportunity to bite grazing cattle\r\nthan any other species of animal. The relative frequency of rabies in these\r\ntwo species of animals is indicated by the carefully compiled statistics of\r\nthe German Empire, which shows that 904 dogs and 223 cows died of rabies in\r\n1898, while in 1899 there were 911 cases in dogs and 171 in cattle. The\r\nlatter receive bites most frequently on the hind legs and in the hips and\r\nabout the lower jaw. These places are most accessible to dogs, owing to the\r\nhabit of cattle to drive their tormentors away by lowering their heads and\r\nusing their horns. Every animal bitten does not necessarily develop the\r\ndisease, but the per cent of fatalities has been variously estimated, and\r\naverages from 25 to 30. This, however, depends on the location and size of\r\nthe wound as well as the amount of hemorrhage produced, and various other\r\nconditions. In general, the nearer the bite is located to the central\r\nnervous system and the deeper the wound inflicted, the greater the danger\r\nof a fatal result. In cases in which the hemorrhage resulting from the bite\r\nis profuse, there is a possibility that the virus will be washed out of the\r\nwound and thus obviate the danger of subsequent appearance of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe virus after being deposited in the wound remains latent for an\r\nextremely variable period of time, which also depends on the size and depth\r\nof the wound as well as its location and the amount of the virulent saliva\r\nintroduced. Experiments have proved that the virus follows the course of\r\nthe nerves to the spinal cord and along the latter to the brain before the\r\nsymptoms appear. Gerlach, having collected the statistics from 133 cases,\r\nhas found this time, known as the period of incubation, to vary from 14 to\r\n285 days. The great majority of cases, however, contract the disease in one\r\nto three months after the bite has been inflicted.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--As in dogs, both furious and dumb rabies are met with, the\r\nformer being more common in cattle. A sharp line of distinction, however,\r\ncan not be drawn between these two forms of the disease, as the furious\r\nform usually merges into the dumb, from the paralysis which appears prior\r\nto death. The typical cases of dumb rabies are those in which the paralysis\r\nappears at the beginning of the attack and remains until death. The disease\r\nfirst manifests itself by a loss of appetite and rumination, stopping of\r\nthe secretion of milk, great restlessness, anxiety, manifestation of fear,\r\nand change in the disposition of the animal. This preliminary stage is\r\nfollowed in a day or two by the stage of excitation, or madness, which is\r\nindicated by increasing restlessness, loud roaring at times with a peculiar\r\nchange in the sound of the voice, violent butting with the horns and pawing\r\nthe ground with the feet, with an insane tendency to attack other animals,\r\nalthough the desire to bite is not so marked in cattle as in the canine\r\nrace. A constant symptom is the increased secretion of saliva with a\r\nconsequent frothing at the mouth, or the secretion may hang from the lips\r\nin long strings. Constipation is marked, and there is manifested a\r\ncontinual, although unsuccessful, desire to defecate. Spasms of the muscles\r\nin different parts of the body are also seen at intervals. About the fourth\r\nday the animal usually becomes quieter and the walk is stiff, unsteady, and\r\nswaying, showing that the final paralysis is coming on. This is called the\r\nparalytic stage. The loss of flesh is extremely rapid, and even during the\r\nshort course of the disease the animal becomes exceedingly emaciated. The\r\ntemperature is never elevated, it usually remaining about normal or even\r\nsubnormal. Finally, there is complete paralysis of the hind quarters, the\r\nanimal being unable to rise, and but for irregular convulsive movements\r\nlies in a comatose condition and dies usually from the fourth to the sixth\r\nday after the appearance of the first symptom.\r\n\r\n_Anatomy._--If animals which have succumbed to rabies are examined post\r\nmortem, very slight evidence of disease will be found in any of the organs,\r\nand, indeed, the absence of any specific lesions may be considered as\r\ncharacteristic. The blood is dark and imperfectly coagulated. The throat is\r\nfrequently reddened, and there may be small spots of extravasated blood in\r\nthe intestines. The stomachs are usually empty. In the spleen there may be\r\nhemorrhagic enlargements (infarcts). The cadavers rapidly undergo\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--It is not an easy matter to decide definitely\r\nthat a given animal has rabies, since the symptoms given above belong in\r\npart to a variety of other diseases, among which may be mentioned the\r\nexcitement seen in young animals following close confinement, certain\r\nvegetable and mineral poisons, acute enteritis, and alterations of the\r\ncentral nervous system in cattle, the most common of which is tuberculosis\r\nof the brain and its covering membranes. The post-mortem lesions, however,\r\nshould assist in making a correct diagnosis. Tetanus may readily be\r\ndifferentiated from rabies by the persistence of muscular cramps,\r\nespecially of the face and abdomen, which cause these muscles to become set\r\nand as hard as wood. In tetanus there is also an absence of a depraved\r\nappetite or of a willful propensity to hurt other animals or to damage the\r\nsurroundings. The cow remains quiet and the general muscular contraction\r\ngives her a rigid appearance. There is an absence of paralysis which marks\r\nthe advanced stage of rabies. The form of dumb rabies in dogs is\r\ncharacterized by the paralysis and pendency of the lower jaw, while in\r\ntetanus the jaws are locked. This locking of the jaws in cattle renders the\r\nanimal incapable of bellowing, as in rabies. Finally, tetanus may be\r\ndistinguished from rabies by the fact that the central nervous system does\r\nnot contain the infectious principle, while in rabies the inoculation of\r\ntest rabbits with the brain or cord of a rabid animal will produce the\r\ndisease with characteristic symptoms after an interval of 15 to 20 days.\r\nThis period of incubation is much longer than in tetanus, since the\r\ninoculation of rabbits with tetanus cultures invariably results in death\r\nafter a short period and usually within three days. The positive evidence\r\nthat a rabid dog has been near cattle would greatly assist in making a\r\ndecision in doubtful cases.\r\n\r\nThe disease in dogs is pretty well recognized by most people, but in case a\r\nsuspected dog is killed it is desirable to open the animal and examine the\r\ncontents of the stomach. While feed is absent, a variety of odd things may\r\nbe present which the abnormally changed appetite of the rabid dog has\r\ninduced it to swallow. Among such things may be straws, sticks, glass,\r\nrags, earth, pieces of leather, and whatever the animal may have\r\nencountered small enough to be swallowed. This miscellaneous collection in\r\nthe stomach of dogs, together with absence of feed, is regarded by\r\nauthorities as a very valuable sign, and in case of doubt may be made use\r\nof by laymen. In important cases, however, the head of the dog, cow, or\r\nother suspected animal should be removed and sent to the nearest biological\r\nlaboratory, where a positive diagnosis can be made within 36 hours by the\r\nhistological examination of the plexiform nerve ganglia, and within two or\r\nthree weeks by the intracerebral inoculation of rabbits with an emulsion of\r\nthe brain of the suspected animal.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--This is useless after the first appearance of symptoms. When,\r\nhowever, a wound inflicted by a rabid animal can be discovered, it should\r\nbe immediately cauterized or even completely extirpated, care being taken\r\nto cut entirely around the wound in the healthy tissues. For cauterizing\r\nthe wound, fuming nitric acid, the hot iron, and 10 per cent solution of\r\nzinc chlorid are the most efficacious. To afford an absolute protection,\r\nthis should be done within a few moments after the bite has been inflicted,\r\nalthough even as late as a few hours it has been known to thwart the\r\ndevelopment of the disease.\r\n\r\nPasteur originated and perfected a system of preventive inoculation against\r\nthis disease which has greatly reduced the mortality in human subjects. Its\r\napplication to animals, however, is difficult and requires considerable\r\ntime and expense. A method of vaccination applicable to animals, consisting\r\nof a single injection of a suspension of \"fixed\" rabies virus, is now being\r\nquite extensively employed by veterinarians. Sanitary regulations which\r\nseek to control effectively the disease by exterminating it among dogs are\r\nmost likely to prove successful. The measures which are adopted to this end\r\ncan not be discussed in this place, but it is a striking fact that where\r\nthe muzzling of all dogs has been rigidly enforced, as in England and in\r\ncertain German districts, the disease has been practically stamped out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\n[Pls. XXXIV-XXXVIII.]\r\n\r\nTuberculosis is an infectious and communicable disease characterized in its\r\nearly stages by the formation, in various organs of the body, of minute\r\nnodules or tubercles, which contain _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_, the cause\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\nThe disease, in its various manifestations, has been known for many\r\ncenturies, and legislative enactments having reference to the destruction\r\nof affected animals and forbidding the use of the flesh date far back into\r\nthe Middle Ages. The opinions entertained regarding the nature and the\r\ncause of the malady varied much in different periods and very markedly\r\ninfluenced the laws and regulations in vogue. Thus, in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, the disease was considered identical with syphilis in man. In\r\nconsequence of this belief very stringent laws were enacted, which made the\r\ndestruction of tuberculous cattle compulsory. In the eighteenth century\r\nthis erroneous conception of the nature of the disease was abandoned and\r\nall restrictions against the use of meat were removed. Since that time,\r\nhowever, its communicable nature has been established by many\r\ninvestigators, and the tide of opinion has again turned in favor of\r\nrepressing the disease and prohibiting the sale of contaminated products.\r\n\r\n_Occurrence._--The statistics concerning tuberculosis show that it is a\r\ndisease prevalent in all civilized countries. In some countries, such as\r\nthe northern part of Norway and Sweden, on the steppes of eastern Europe\r\nand Russia, in Sicily and Iceland, and in Algiers, it is said to be quite\r\nrare.\r\n\r\nThe returns from testing British cattle with tuberculin, supplied by the\r\nRoyal Veterinary College, as stated in March, 1900, showed that among\r\n15,392 animals tested 4,105, or 26 per cent, reacted.\r\n\r\nDuring the slaughter of cattle for pleuropneumonia careful examinations of\r\nthe carcasses were made for tuberculosis. Of 300 head killed near Edinburgh\r\n120, or 40 per cent, were tuberculous. Of 4,160 killed in England 20 per\r\ncent were tuberculous. Of one of these lots of cattle (451 animals) the\r\npresident of the Lancashire Farmers' Association testified that they were\r\nfairly representative cattle--cows, heifers, and growing stock--a\r\nthoroughly mixed lot; 20 per cent of them had tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nOf 398 bovine animals taken haphazard in the city of Manchester, 120, or 30\r\nper cent, were tuberculous. Among them were 168 cows, 69, or 41 per cent,\r\nbeing tuberculous, and 2 having diseased udders.\r\n\r\nThe result of testing the Queen's herd at Windsor was that 36 out of 40, or\r\n90 per cent, were found tuberculous.\r\n\r\nThe investigations made by the British Dairy Farmers' Association deserve\r\nparticular attention, coming as they do directly from a cattle owners'\r\norganization. The council of this association \"resolved to submit the\r\ngeneral consideration of the question to a committee, with a view to some\r\nmore definite understanding as to the possible extent to which tuberculosis\r\nexists in dairy cattle.\" The secretary was instructed to write to a number\r\nof dairy farmers being members of the association, asking their cooperation\r\nand the use of their herds for the application of the tests. Of the herds\r\noffered, 9 were selected, containing 461 cows and 12 bulls, and 188 of\r\nthese animals reacted, being 40.8 per cent. There were among these cattle\r\n335 Shorthorns, of which 119, or 35 per cent, reacted; 67 crossbreds, of\r\nwhich 28, or 42 per cent, reacted; 47 Ayrshires, of which 37, or 80 per\r\ncent, reacted.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment of much interest is that of the Cheshire County Council.\r\nThe technical instruction committee set aside £250 to be used by a joint\r\ncommittee from the agricultural and horticultural schools and Worleson\r\nDairy Institute for applying the tuberculin test to their herds. The tests\r\nwere made February 15, 1899. The results were: Worleson herd of 54 animals,\r\n16 diseased, or 29.6 per cent; agricultural school herd of 17 animals, 4\r\ndiseased, or 23.5 per cent. The Worleson herd consisted of Shorthorn cows.\r\nIn each herd the purebred Shorthorn bull was tuberculous. The results of\r\nthe tuberculin test were confirmed by the slaughter of the animals and\r\nexamination of the carcasses.\r\n\r\nSir T. D. G. Carmichael, member of Parliament for Midlothian, gave evidence\r\nbefore the royal commission that his Polled Angus herd was tested in the\r\nspring of 1895. \"The results of the test were fearfully unexpected and\r\nalarming.\" Of 30 tested 13 showed decided reaction--43 per cent. Again, he\r\nspeaks of having 41 animals tested the same spring and 16 reacted--39.5 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nOf 80 Shorthorn cattle intended for export which were tested 34 reacted, or\r\n42 per cent.\r\n\r\nOf a herd of 25 British Shorthorns recently tested in quarantine 40 per\r\ncent were found tuberculous.\r\n\r\nThe addition of these animals above referred to gives 20,930 head examined\r\nand 5,441, or 26 per cent, pronounced tuberculous. And these herds were not\r\nselected because they were supposed to be tuberculous, but represent the\r\ngeneral cattle stock of the country. These animals included at least 470\r\nhead of Shorthorns, of which 170, or 34 per cent, were tuberculous.\r\n\r\nTo these facts may be added the evidence of Prof. Bang that in the first\r\nhalf of the nineteenth century tuberculosis was brought to Denmark by\r\ncattle from Switzerland, Schleswig, and England, and that the same thing is\r\nnow going on in Sweden and Norway, particularly through English cattle.\r\nAlso the evidence of M. Sivori, chief of section at the ministry of\r\nagriculture, Argentina, who has investigated tuberculosis in that country\r\nand who says that \"30 or 40 years ago tuberculosis was unknown in Argentine\r\ncattle, and it is still unknown among the native (criollo) cattle. Its\r\nappearance dates from the introduction of pure breeding animals. Statistics\r\nprove that tuberculosis is observed among the grades--above all among those\r\nof the Durham and less among the Hereford.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, the reports of the royal commission of Victoria, Australia, and\r\nof the New Zealand department of agriculture show a large proportion of\r\ntuberculous cattle in those colonies, where the disease was almost\r\ncertainly carried by British cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner that tuberculosis has been carried from Great Britain to\r\nDenmark, Sweden, Norway, Argentina, and Australia, it has also been taken\r\nto Canada. In one herd of imported cattle slaughtered in the Canadian\r\nquarantine station, 13 of the 14 animals were found tuberculous. One of the\r\nlargest Shorthorn herds in Canada was some time ago tested because an\r\nanimal from it was condemned when offered for shipment to the United\r\nStates. This herd was found to be very badly affected, and an effort is\r\nbeing made to eradicate the disease by the Bang method. A Canadian official\r\npublication says of another Shorthorn herd, which at one time had a very\r\nhigh reputation, that when an investigation in regard to tuberculosis was\r\nrecently made the disease was found among ordinary cattle wherever animals\r\nfrom this herd had been introduced, and that this herd, which had been\r\nlooked upon as one of the greatest benefits to the farming community, was\r\nreally a danger, because it disseminated tuberculosis among the farmers'\r\nherds. Still another well-known herd recently attracted attention because\r\nfour animals from it offered for export to the United States were all\r\ntuberculous.\r\n\r\nFrom December 23, 1900, to February 19, 1901, the period that the\r\ndepartment inspector tested all Canadian cattle intended for shipment to\r\nthe United States, 140 purebred Shorthorns and 3 Shorthorn grades were\r\ntested, and of the total number 26, or 18 per cent, reacted. During the\r\nfirst month that this inspection was enforced, and when it may be assumed\r\nthat the condition of the cattle most nearly represented what it had\r\npreviously been, 74 cattle were offered for importation, and 18, or 24.3\r\nper cent, were found tuberculous.\r\n\r\nIn justice to Shorthorn cattle it should be said in this connection that\r\nthey are probably no more susceptible to tuberculosis than are other\r\nbreeds, but the disease has been allowed to spread in certain herds and\r\nfamilies to such an extent as to give a wrong impression concerning the\r\nbreed as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe slaughterhouse statistics of Prussia show 14.6 per cent of the cattle\r\nand 2.14 per cent of the hogs to be tuberculous. In Saxony the percentage\r\nis 29.13 with cattle and 3.10 with hogs. In the city of Leipzig the figures\r\nare 36.4 for cattle and 2.17 for hogs. (Siedamgrotzky.) Of 20,850 animals\r\nin Belgium tested with tuberculin in 1896, 48.88 per cent reacted.\r\n(Stubbe.) Of 25,439 tested in Denmark from 1893 to 1895, 49.3 per cent\r\nreacted; and of 67,263 tested from 1896 to 1898, 32.8 per cent reacted.\r\n(Bang.)\r\n\r\nFigures available in the United States allow us to make a reliable estimate\r\nof the extent of tuberculosis of cattle.

These were mostly dairy cattle, and in some cases herds\r\nwere suspected of being diseased.\r\n\r\nLater reports of tuberculin tests made in the United States from July 1,\r\n1917, to March 1, 1922, on 3,911,546 cattle by State, county, and Federal\r\nofficers engaged in cooperative tuberculosis eradication work showed\r\n153,046 reactions, or 3.9 per cent.\r\n\r\nAll cattle in the District of Columbia, numbering 1,701, were tested with\r\ntuberculin in 1909-10, and 18.87 per cent reacted. In 1909-11 herds in\r\nMaryland and Virginia supplying milk to the District of Columbia were\r\ntested, with 19.03 and 15.38 per cent of reactions, respectively, among\r\n4,501 cattle.\r\n\r\nAll cattle in the District of Columbia were tuberculin tested in 1920-21,\r\nnumbering 1,313, and 5 animals reacted, or 0.4 per cent, demonstrating that\r\ntuberculosis may be eradicated from all the herds in a circumscribed area.\r\n\r\nThe beef cattle of the United States show a much smaller proportion of the\r\ndisease than dairy cattle, though the percentage of cattle found\r\ntuberculous in the Government meat-inspection service has increased\r\nconsiderably in recent years. This increase is due partly, but not wholly,\r\nto more stringent inspection. Of 7,781,030 adult cattle slaughtered under\r\nFederal inspection during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1911, 76,448 were\r\nfound tuberculous, a percentage of 0.98.\r\n\r\nFrom the statistics above referred to, and other data, it appears that in\r\nthe more densely populated areas of Europe and America from 5 to 50 per\r\ncent of the dairy cattle are more or less affected with tuberculosis, while\r\nthe proportion of beef cattle affected is distinctly less, ranging from\r\n0.14 to 30 per cent. This difference is due to a number of causes. Beef\r\ncattle average younger when slaughtered. They are not so frequently\r\nstabled, and are for that reason less liable to infection, and as the males\r\nconstitute a large proportion of this class of animals the effect of milk\r\nsecretion in lowering the vital forces is not so apparent. In the United\r\nStates it has been estimated that about 10 per cent of the dairy cattle are\r\ntuberculous, while only about 2 per cent of the beef cattle are so\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n_Cause and nature of the disease._--The cause of tuberculosis is the\r\ntubercle bacillus, which gains entrance to the body, lodges somewhere in\r\nthe tissues, and begins to grow and multiply at that point. As this\r\nbacillus vegetates and increases in numbers it excretes substances which\r\nact as irritants and poisons and which lead to the formation of a small\r\nnodule, called a tubercle, at the point of irritation. As the bacilli are\r\ndisseminated through the animal body they affect many parts and cause the\r\nformation of an enormous number of tubercles. By the union of such\r\ntubercles, masses of tubercular material are formed, which in some cases\r\nare of great size. The disease is called tuberculosis because it is\r\ncharacterized by the formation of these peculiar nodules, and the bacillus\r\nwhich causes the disease is for the same reason known technically as the\r\n_Mycobacterium tuberculosis._\r\n\r\nThere are undoubtedly predisposing conditions which contribute toward the\r\ndevelopment of the disease; some of these are found in the animal body and\r\nothers in the environment. An enfeebled condition caused by insufficient\r\nfeed, exposure to great extremes of atmospheric temperature and insanitary\r\nsurroundings, or the drain occasioned by heavy production of milk, appear\r\nto aid the development of the bacillus, and there is also a special\r\nindividual susceptibility in some cases which may be otherwise described as\r\nan inability of the animal tissues to resist and destroy the bacilli when\r\nthey have penetrated to the inner recesses of the body.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions of environment which aid the development of\r\ntuberculosis may be mentioned stabling with lack of ventilation, damp\r\nbuildings, the keeping of many animals together, drafts of air which cause\r\ncolds and catarrhs, and, in general, everything which prevents the animals\r\nfrom developing and maintaining the highest condition of health. None of\r\nthese conditions of body or environment are sufficient to cause the\r\ndisease, however, unless the animals are exposed to the _Mycobacterium\r\ntuberculosis_ and it penetrates the tissues of their bodies.\r\n\r\nThe ways in which the tubercle bacilli find their way into the body may be\r\nconsidered under four heads: (1) By inhalation into the lungs; (2) by\r\ntaking into the digestive tract in the milk of tuberculous cows or with\r\nother contaminated feed; (3) during coition when the sexual organs are\r\ntuberculous; (4) from the tuberculous mother to the fetus in the uterus.\r\nThe bacilli can reach the lungs by inhalation only when the bacilli are\r\nthoroughly dried and pulverized and in condition to be carried by currents\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the bacilli withstand drying for months before they\r\nlose their power of producing disease. They leave the bodies of diseased\r\nanimals in several ways. There may be a little discharge occasionally\r\ncoughed up as a spray from the diseased lungs, or this material may be\r\nswallowed and the bacilli carried off with the excrement, or milk may be\r\nspilt, or there may be a discharge from the vagina when the genital organs\r\nare tuberculous. There may also be ulcers of the intestines, from which\r\nmany bacilli escape with the feces. The bacilli from these sources may\r\nbecome dried and pulverized and carried in the air of the stable and into\r\nthe lungs of still healthy cattle, where the disease then develops.\r\n\r\nThe disease of the stomach, intestines, and mesenteric glands is very\r\nprobably the result of feed infection. Tubercle bacilli may have been\r\nscattered upon the feed by diseased animals, but the most common source of\r\nsuch infection is the milk of tuberculous cows. Calves may become infected\r\nin this way. The disease may remain latent until the animal becomes older.\r\nThe not-infrequent occurrence of tuberculosis of the uterus and ovaries\r\nmakes it probable that the disease may be transmitted by a diseased bull or\r\ncarried by a healthy one from a diseased cow to a number of healthy cows.\r\n\r\nThe source of infection is always some previous case of the disease, for\r\nthe disease can never rise spontaneously; hence, in those stables in which\r\nthere is frequent change of cattle the introduction of tuberculosis by\r\ncattle coming from other infected stables is the most frequent source of\r\ninfection. Since the bacilli when dried can be carried by the air, it is\r\nnot necessary that healthy animals come in direct contact with cases of\r\ndisease to become infected. In general, the greatest number of cases occur\r\nin the immediate environment of cities, where there are not only abundant\r\nopportunities for infection, owing to the frequent introduction of new\r\nanimals into herds, but where the sanitary conditions may be regarded as\r\nthe poorest.\r\n\r\nThe bacillus of tuberculosis was discovered by Robert Koch in 1882. It is a\r\nslender, rodlike body (see Pl. XXVIII, fig. 6) from one-third to two-thirds\r\nthe diameter of a red blood corpuscle in length. As already explained, when\r\nthe bacillus has become lodged in any organ or tissue it begins to\r\nmultiply, and thereby causes an irritation in the tissue around it, which\r\nleads to the formation of the so-called tubercle. The tubercle, when it has\r\nreached its full growth, is a little nodule about the size of a millet\r\nseed. It is composed of several kinds of tissue cells. Soon a change takes\r\nplace within the tubercle. Disintegration begins, and a soft, cheesy\r\nsubstance is formed in the center, which may contain particles of lime\r\nsalts. When these tubercles continue to form in large numbers they run\r\ntogether, forming masses of various sizes. The disintegration which attacks\r\nthem leads to the formation of large cheesy masses of a yellowish color,\r\ncontaining more or less of lime salts in the form of gritty particles.\r\nThese large tuberculous masses are surrounded by or embedded in layers of\r\nfibrous tissue which in some cases becomes very dense and thick.\r\n\r\nThe disease is thus a development of these tubercles in one or more organs\r\nof the body. The distribution and number of the tubercles determine the\r\ncourse of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn a large number of cases the changes are limited to the lungs and the\r\nserous membranes[4] of the thorax and abdomen. Pathologists have been in\r\nthe habit of calling the lung disease tuberculosis and the disease of the\r\nserous membranes \"pearly disease.\" Statistics have shown that in about\r\none-half of the cases both lungs and serous membranes are diseased, in\r\none-third only the lungs, and in one-fifth only the serous membranes. At\r\nthe same time the lymphatic glands near the diseased organs are usually\r\ninvolved. Other organs, such as the liver, not infrequently contain\r\ntubercles. Though the disease may remain restricted to a single organ, it\r\nnow and then is found generalized, affecting all organs of the body.\r\n\r\nIn the lungs (Pl. XXXIV) the changes observed vary according to the age and\r\nintensity of the disease process. They usually begin with the appearance of\r\nvery minute tubercles. These may appear in large numbers on the surface of\r\nthe lungs or within the lung tissue. Later the contents become cheesy and\r\npartly calcified. When these tubercles are sufficiently numerous to become\r\nconfluent, large masses may be formed, which undergo the same retrogressive\r\nchanges of caseation and calcification. In addition to the formation of\r\ntubercles in the lung tissue, certain other changes take place. There is\r\nusually bronchitis with abundant catarrhal secretion; this plugs up the\r\nsmaller air tubes, and the lung tissue supplied with air by the tubes\r\ncollapses. Subsequently it becomes filled with yellowish, cheesy matter,\r\nwhich greatly distends the small air tubes and air vesicles\r\n(bronchopneumonia). The connective tissue between the lung lobules, around\r\nthe tubercles, and around the air tubes becomes thickened and indurated. In\r\nthe larynx and the bronchi tubercles may vegetate upon the mucous membrane,\r\nand ulcers may result from their breaking down. The inflammatory irritation\r\nwhich the growth of the tubercles on the surface of the lungs arouses gives\r\nrise to adhesion of the lungs to the ribs and diaphragm. This adhesion is\r\nsometimes so firm and extensive that the lungs appear grown to the chest\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the lungs in advanced stages of the disease are cut open\r\nwe observe large yellowish masses, from one-quarter to three-quarters of an\r\ninch in diameter, of a cheesy texture, in which calcified, gritty particles\r\nare embedded and which are surrounded by very firm connective tissue. The\r\nneighboring lung tissue, when collapsed and involved in bronchopneumonia,\r\nhas the color and consistency of pale-red flesh. The air tubes, large and\r\nsmall, stand out prominently on the cut surface. They are distended with a\r\npasty, yellowish, cheesy mass, surrounded and enveloped in thick mucus, and\r\ntheir walls greatly thickened. The larger bronchi may be sacculated, owing\r\nto the distention produced by the cheesy contents.\r\n\r\nThe disease usually attacks the bronchial glands, which are situated on the\r\ntrachea and bronchial tubes at the bifurcation. The changes in the glands\r\nare the same as those going on in the lung tissue, and they frequently\r\nreach an enormous size.\r\n\r\nThe tubercle formation on the serous membranes covering the lungs and chest\r\nwall (Pl. XXXVII, fig. 2), which may go on at the same time with the lung\r\ndisease or independent of it, has been called \"pearly disease,\" on account\r\nof the peculiar appearance of the tubercles. These begin as very minute,\r\ngrayish nodules, which give the originally smooth, lustrous membrane a\r\nroughened appearance. These minute tubercles enlarge, become confluent, and\r\nproject above the surface of the membrane as wartlike masses, attaining the\r\nsize of peas. In this stage their attachment to the membrane is by means of\r\ndelicate fibers. The attachment is loose, so that the tubercle hangs by a\r\nshort pedicle or neck and may be moved slightly to and fro. Large masses\r\nare frequently formed by a coalescence of many tubercles and the secondary\r\nformation of the same. These may be found on the lungs, the ribs, and the\r\ndiaphragm. These tubercles likewise undergo degenerative changes. The\r\ncenter partly softens and partly calcifies into a grayish mortarlike mass,\r\nand is gritty. Associated with the formation of tubercles on the pleura,\r\nthose glands situated back of the center of the lungs between the two main\r\nlobes (posterior mediastinal) become greatly enlarged and the center\r\ncheesy. (Pl. XXXVI, fig. 1.) They may compress the esophagus and interfere\r\nwith swallowing. The size attained by these tumors and new growths is well\r\nillustrated by the fact that, taken together, they not infrequently weigh\r\nfrom 60 to 80 pounds. The bronchial glands, which in the healthy state are\r\nnot so large as horse-chestnuts, have been found to attain a weight of more\r\nthan 10 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the abdominal cavity tubercles may be found, both in the organs and on\r\nthe serous membranes covering them. They are situated usually on the\r\nomentum, or caul (see Pl. XXXVI, fig. 2), the diaphragm, and the walls of\r\nthe abdomen. In the liver large and small tubercular masses are\r\noccasionally encountered. (See Pl. XXXV.) The mesenteric glands are\r\noccasionally enlarged and tuberculous; likewise the glands near the liver.\r\nTubercles may also develop in the spleen, the kidneys, the uterus and\r\novaries, and the testicles.\r\n\r\nTubercular affection of the intestines seems to be quite rare, although\r\nulcers of the large intestines have been observed. Nodules may also form\r\nunder the serous covering of the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe brain and spinal cord are occasionally found tuberculous. Of 40 cases,\r\nSemmer found tuberculosis of the brain in 4. It is not improbable that,\r\nowing to the infrequency of exposing the brain and spinal cord,\r\ntuberculosis may have escaped the attention of pathologists, and it may be\r\nthat it is not so uncommon as is generally supposed. The tubercles occur on\r\nthe membranes of the brain as well as in the substance of the brain itself.\r\nThey project into the ventricles as masses, varying in size from a pinhead\r\nto a hen's egg. They finally lead to various inflammatory changes. Jˆhne\r\nhas observed numerous small tubercles on the membranes of the spinal cord.\r\n\r\nVery rarely tuberculous lesions have been observed in the bones and muscles\r\nof the body. Not so rare, however, is the affection of the lymphatic glands\r\nembedded in the muscular tissue, and those which can be felt beneath the\r\nskin. These are situated at the joints, under the jaw, and along the neck.\r\n\r\nOf late tubercular disease of the udder in cows (Pl. XXXVIII) has received\r\nconsiderable attention from sanitarians, owing to the infection of the milk\r\nwith the virus of tuberculosis. According to those who have given this\r\nsubject special attention, the udder becomes swollen uniformly and quite\r\nfirm. This swelling, which is painless, frequently attacks but one quarter,\r\nmore rarely two, these being usually the hind quarters. The larger milk\r\nducts contain yellowish, cheesy particles, in which are many tubercle\r\nbacilli. Later larger nodules can be felt within the udder, which undergo\r\nthe various changes to which tubercles are subject. The udder may grow very\r\nhard to the touch and become very large, weighing in some cases up to 40\r\npounds. The milk, at first normal, becomes thin and watery after a month or\r\nso, and is mixed with flakes and tubercle bacilli.\r\n\r\nAs regards the frequency of the tuberculous processes in the different\r\norgans, the following carefully compiled statistics of the disease in\r\nBavaria and Baden may serve as a guide:\r\n\r\n  Bavaria:                                                 Per cent.\r\n  Tuberculosis of lungs and serous membranes                  41\r\n  Tuberculosis of lungs alone                                 33\r\n  Tuberculosis of serous membranes alone (pearly disease)     17\r\n  Tuberculosis of other organs                                 8\r\n\r\n  Baden:\r\n  Tuberculosis of lungs alone                                 21\r\n  Tuberculosis of serous membranes alone                      28\r\n  Both combined                                               39\r\n  Generalized tuberculosis                                     9\r\n  Tuberculosis of the sexual organs alone                      3\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The beginning of the disease usually passes unnoticed,\r\ninasmuch as it is very slow and insidious and rarely accompanied with\r\nfever. When the lungs are involved a dull, short cough is noticed, which\r\nmay later on become prolonged, convulsive, and very troublesome to the\r\nanimal. The cough is more frequent in the morning after movement and\r\ndrinking. The breathing varies. Only when much of the lung tissue is\r\ndiseased is it labored and accompanied with active movements of the chest\r\nand nostrils. Discharge from the nose is rare or absent. At times, however,\r\nwhen the tubercles have broken down and cavities containing cheesy masses\r\nhave formed in the lung tissue, or when the air tubes have become filled\r\nwith cheesy and mucous masses, coughing will dislodge them and cause their\r\ndischarge. In advanced stages the breath may have a disagreeable odor.\r\nPressure on the chest wall may give rise to pain.\r\n\r\nThe general effect on the body is at first slight. In fact, animals may\r\nremain in good flesh for a considerable time. Invariably as the disease\r\nprogresses loss of flesh and appetite and paleness of the mucous membranes\r\nbecome manifest. These symptoms are accompanied with a gradual diminution\r\nof the milk secretion. The debilitated condition of the animal is also\r\nmanifested by a staring coat and a tough, dry, harsh skin (hidebound).\r\nDigestive disturbances are indicated by tympanites, or distention of the\r\nrumen by gas, colic, and diarrhea, alternating with constipation. The\r\nanimal generally dies from exhaustion after a period of sickness which may\r\nlast months or even years.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XXXIV.

The lower figure\r\nillustrates in section a mass of tubercles which have undergone cheesy\r\ndegeneration, and some of which are surrounded by dense connective tissue.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXV. Tuberculosis of the liver. A large portion of the lobe\r\nrepresented in the plate has undergone tuberculous changes. Numerous\r\nnodules are shown in various stages of the disease, the majority of which,\r\nhowever, contain the yellowish, partly cheesy, partly gritty areas\r\ncharacteristic of advanced tuberculous degeneration. This large mass\r\ninvolves the surface of the liver, and also extends into the liver\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXVI. Tuberculosis of lymph gland and of omentum (caul).\r\n\r\nFig. 1. A lymph gland from the region of the thorax behind or above the\r\nesophagus, or gullet (posterior, or dorsal, mediastinum). The gland is\r\nshown cut through and laid open. It is very much enlarged, and the\r\nyellowish cheesy masses which represent tissue undergoing tuberculous\r\nchanges are well shown on the cut surface.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Omentum, or caul, resting upon the paunch. The reddish nodules with\r\nwhich the membrane is beset are tubercles, the product of the disease.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXVII. Fig. 1.

Tuberculosis of cow's udder. The udder was uniformly swollen\r\nand quite firm. Small cheesy foci and yellowish lines of tuberculous\r\nmaterial follow the course of the milk ducts. The mucous membrane of the\r\nmilk cistern (_a_) is ulcerated and covered with yellowish cheesy\r\nparticles. The supramammary lymphatic gland (_b_) is greatly enlarged and\r\ncontains many miliary tubercular foci.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTuberculosis in the abdominal organs is often signalized by abortion and by\r\nabnormal sexual manifestations. When the brain is involved, the disease may\r\ncause convulsions, unconsciousness, paralysis, as well as peculiar\r\nmovements in a circle, oblique position of the head, etc. Lydtin quotes the\r\nfollowing description of the disease as taken from a Swiss sanitary order:\r\n\r\n  A dry, short, interrupted, hoarse cough, which the sick animals\r\n  manifest, especially in the morning at feeding time, still more after\r\n  somewhat violent exertion. At first these animals may be full blooded\r\n  and lay on a considerable amount of fat when well fed. As the disease\r\n  progresses they grow thin and show more and more those appearances which\r\n  indicate diseased nutrition, such as a staring, lusterless, disheveled\r\n  coat; dirty, tense skin, which appears very pale in those regions free\r\n  from hair. The temperature of the skin is below normal. The loss of fat\r\n  causes sinking of the eyes in their sockets. They appear swimming in\r\n  water, and their expression is weak. The cough is more frequent, but\r\n  never or very rarely accompanied with discharge. The body continues to\r\n  emaciate, even with plenty of food and a good appetite, so that the\r\n  quantity of milk is small. At times in the early stages of the disease,\r\n  still more in the later stages, the diseased animals manifest\r\n  considerable tenderness when pressure is applied to the front or the\r\n  sides of the chest by coughing, moaning, etc. Often symptoms are wanting\r\n  in spite of the existence of the disease.\r\n\r\nLydtin also quotes at length a description of the abnormal sexual desire\r\noccasionally observed among cows when affected with this disease.\r\n\r\n_Diagnosis._--A disease so varied in its attack upon the different organs\r\nof the body and in the extent of the disease process must necessarily lead\r\nto mistakes when diagnosis is attempted by ordinary means of examination.\r\nIt has been confounded with the later stages of pleuropneumonia, with\r\nparasitic diseases of the brain, the lungs, the intestines, and with\r\nactinomycosis. A careful examination of the lungs by auscultation and\r\npercussion enables the expert to locate large tuberculous masses, owing to\r\ndullness, loss of respiratory murmur, and abnormal sounds, such as blowing,\r\nwhistling, and creaking. The majority of cases of tuberculosis in cattle,\r\nhowever, including many in which the lungs are quite seriously involved,\r\ncan not be detected in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUBERCULIN TEST.\r\n\r\nThe tuberculin test, which is marvelously accurate in its indications, has\r\nbeen almost universally adopted for the detection of tuberculosis.\r\nTuberculin is a drug prepared by sterilizing, filtering, and concentrating\r\nthe liquids in which the tubercle bacillus has been allowed to vegetate. It\r\ncontains the cooked products of the growth of these bacilli, but no living\r\nbacilli; consequently, when this substance is injected under the skin of an\r\nanimal it is absolutely unable to produce the disease, cause abortion, or\r\notherwise injure the animal. In case the injected animal is normal there is\r\nno more effect upon the system than would be expected from the injection of\r\nsterile water; however, if the animal is tuberculous, a decided rise of\r\ntemperature will follow the use of tuberculin by the subcutaneous method.\r\nThis substance, discovered by Koch, has the effect, when injected into the\r\ntissues of a tuberculous animal, of causing a decided rise of temperature\r\nor other manifestations while it has no such effect upon animals free from\r\nthe disease. The value of tuberculin for this purpose was tested during the\r\nyears 1890 and 1891 by Guttman, Roeckl and Sch¸tz, Bang and Salomonsen,\r\nLydtin, Jˆhne and Siedamgrotzky, Nocard, and many others. It was at once\r\nrecognized as a most remarkable and accurate method of detecting\r\ntuberculosis even in the early stages and when the disease had yet made but\r\nlittle progress. It is now quite generally employed.\r\n\r\nThe tuberculin test came into existence through the most careful and\r\nthorough scientific experimentation.\r\n\r\nAs a result of its use an accurate diagnosis may be established in more\r\nthan 90 per cent of the cases tested. The relatively few failures in\r\ndiagnoses are included among two classes of cattle. The first class\r\ncontains those that are tuberculous, but which do not react either because\r\nof the slight effect of an ordinary-sized dose of tuberculin on an advanced\r\ncase of the disease with so much natural tuberculin already in the system,\r\nor on account of a recent previous test with tuberculin which produces a\r\ntolerance to this material, lasting for about six weeks. The second class\r\nincludes those that are not tuberculous, but which show indications of a\r\nreaction as a result of (_a_) advanced pregnancy, (_b_) the excitement of\r\n[oe]strum, (_c_) concurrent diseases, as inflammation of the lungs,\r\nintestines, uterus, udder, or other parts, abortion, retention of\r\nafterbirth, indigestion, etc., (_d_) inclosure in a hot, stuffy stable,\r\nespecially in summer, or exposure to cold drafts or rains, (_e_) any change\r\nin the method of feeding, watering, or stabling of the animal during the\r\ntest. Notwithstanding all these possibilities of error, the results of\r\nthousands of tests show that in less than 3 per cent of the cases tested do\r\nthese failures actually occur. In the first class the chances of error are\r\ndecidedly reduced by the skilled veterinarian by making careful physical\r\nexamination and diagnosing clinically these advanced cases, and by the\r\ninjection of double or triple doses into all recently tested cattle, with\r\nthe taking of the after-temperature, beginning two hours following the\r\ninjection and continuing hourly for 20 hours.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that tuberculin should be applied only by or under\r\nthe direction of a competent veterinarian, capable not only of injecting\r\nthe tuberculin but also of interpreting the results, and particularly of\r\npicking out all clinical cases by physical examination. The latter\r\nobservation is extremely important and should always be made on every\r\nanimal tested.\r\n\r\nIn the second class, where the temperature test is used, errors are avoided\r\nby eliminating from the test those cases that are nearing parturition or\r\nare in heat or show evidence of the previously mentioned diseases or\r\nexhibit temperatures sufficiently high to make them unreliable for use as\r\nnormal. Where other methods of test are used these conditions do not have\r\nan important bearing on the results. In addition, a satisfactory tuberculin\r\nmust be used; also an accurate thermometer and a reliable syringe, in order\r\nthat a sufficient dose of tuberculin may be given. Finally, the number of\r\napparent errors of the tuberculin test will be greatly diminished if a\r\ncareful post-mortem examination is made, giving especial attention to the\r\nlymph glands. This low percentage of failures being the case, cattle owners\r\nshould welcome the tuberculin test, not only for their own interest but for\r\nthe welfare of the public as well. Where this method of diagnosing the\r\ndisease has been adopted tuberculosis is gradually being eradicated.\r\nWithout its use the disease can not be controlled and the owner is\r\nconfronted with serious and continuous losses; with its use the disease can\r\nbe eradicated from the herd, a clean herd established in a few years\r\nwithout very serious loss or hardship, and the danger of its spread to man\r\nremoved. Tuberculin may therefore be considered a most beneficial discovery\r\nfor the stock raiser.\r\n\r\nLaw has clearly stated the question when he says--\r\n\r\n  Many stock owners still entertain an ignorant and unwarranted dread of\r\n  the tuberculin test. It is true that when recklessly used by ignorant and\r\n  careless people it may be made a root of evil, yet as employed by the\r\n  intelligent and careful expert it is not only perfectly safe, but it is\r\n  the only known means of ascertaining approximately the actual number\r\n  affected in a given herd. In most infected herds living under what are in\r\n  other respects good hygienic conditions two-thirds or three-fourths are\r\n  not to be detected without its aid, so that in clearing a herd from\r\n  tuberculosis and placing both herd and products above suspicion the test\r\n  becomes essential. * * * In skilled hands the tuberculin test will show\r\n  at least nine-tenths of all cases of tuberculosis when other methods of\r\n  diagnosis will not detect one-tenth.\r\n\r\nProbably the most popular objection to tuberculin is that it is too\r\nsearching, since it discovers cases in which the lesions are small and\r\nobscure. While this fact is admitted, it should also be remembered that\r\nsuch a small lesion to-day may break down and become widely disseminated in\r\na relatively short period. Therefore any cow affected with tuberculosis,\r\neven to a slight degree, must be considered as dangerous not only to the\r\nother animals in the herd but also to the consumer of her products.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Bang, of Copenhagen, one of the highest European authorities, in\r\nhis paper presented to the Congress for the Study of Human and Animal\r\nTuberculosis, at Paris, said:\r\n\r\n  Numerous tests made in almost every civilized country have demonstrated\r\n  that in the majority of cases tuberculin is an excellent means for\r\n  diagnosing the existence or nonexistence of the disease, but giving us no\r\n  positive information as to the extent to which the disease has\r\n  progressed.   When tuberculin produces a typical reaction we may be\r\n  almost sure that there exists in the body of the animal a tubercular\r\n  process. The cases in which a careful examiner has not succeeded in\r\n  finding it are very rare, and I am led to believe that when,\r\n  notwithstanding all the pains taken, it has escaped discovery, the reason\r\n  is that it is located in a portion of the body that is particularly\r\n  inaccessible. Nevertheless, it is not to be denied that a fever, entirely\r\n  accidental and of short duration, may in some rare cases have simulated a\r\n  reaction. However this may be, the error committed in wrongly condemning\r\n  an occasional animal for tuberculosis is of no practical consequence.\r\n\r\n  A worse aspect of the case is that there are some diseased animals in\r\n  which tuberculin fails to discover the existence of tuberculosis. In\r\n  most of these, no doubt, the deposits are old, insignificant, and\r\n  generally calcified, or they are cases where the disease is arrested and\r\n  perhaps in process of recovery, and which are possibly incapable of\r\n  disseminating the contagion. But it is known that there are cases, not\r\n  altogether rare, where tuberculin fails to cause a reaction in a highly\r\n  tuberculous animal, and consequently one in which the disease exists in\r\n  an extremely contagious form. For this reason a clinical examination\r\n  should always be made of an animal which does not give a reaction but\r\n  which shows symptoms indicating that, notwithstanding the test, it may\r\n  suffer from tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nNocard, of Paris, wrote also in 1898 as follows:\r\n\r\n  The degree of certainty of the indications furnished may be stated in\r\n  precise terms. _The observation of a clear reaction to tuberculin is\r\n  unequivocal; the animal is tuberculous._ The pretended errors imputed to\r\n  the method are explained by the extreme sensitiveness of the reagent,\r\n  which is capable of detecting the smallest lesion. It often requires\r\n  prolonged and minute researches in the depths of all the tissues to\r\n  discover the few miliary centers, the presence of which has been\r\n  revealed. The reaction is absolutely specific. In those cases where it is\r\n  observed with animals which show lesions of another disease\r\n  (actinomycosis, hydatid disease, verminous bronchitis, distomatosis), it\r\n  may be affirmed that there exists, in addition to these conspicuous\r\n  changes, a tuberculous center which alone has provoked the reaction.\r\n\r\n  _The failure to react does not necessarily imply absence of\r\n  tuberculosis._ Such failures of tuberculin are very exceptional. They are\r\n  seen most frequently with animals affected with tuberculosis in a very\r\n  advanced stage and made evident by plain external signs. Sometimes, also,\r\n  there are found at the post-mortem examination of animals which have not\r\n  reacted small fibrous or calcified lesions in such a condition that one\r\n  is tempted to believe them cured. Whether sterile or not, these lesions\r\n  have no tendency to increase, and they are not very dangerous from the\r\n  point of view of contagion.\r\n\r\nThese opinions of two eminent authorities, living in different countries,\r\nafter long experience of their own and after studying the results of the\r\nmany tests made in different parts of the world, should have great weight.\r\nThey are essentially the same throughout.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Voges compiled statistics of tuberculin tests, the accuracy of\r\nwhich had been determined by post-mortem examination. Of 7,327 animals\r\ntested, it appeared that errors had been made with 204, or 2.78 per cent.\r\nIn the work of the Pennsylvania Live Stock Sanitary Board post-mortem\r\nexaminations were made on about 4,400 reacting cattle and the disease was\r\nfound in all but 8 of those which had given characteristic reactions.\r\n\r\nThe results of a much larger number of tests might be compiled at this\r\ntime, but they would not materially change the average of those already\r\nmentioned. It is plain that tuberculin is a remarkably accurate test of\r\ntuberculosis, that the animals which react may be safely considered as\r\ntuberculous, and that when a careful clinical examination is practiced in\r\naddition to the test there are few animals in a dangerous condition which\r\nescape detection.\r\n\r\nThe first questions asked by those who oppose the adoption of the\r\ntuberculin tests are: Is this test infallible? and, if it is not\r\ninfallible, why should it be forced upon the cattle owners of the country?\r\n\r\nIn answer to these questions it may be said that tuberculin is not\r\nabsolutely infallible, and yet it is by far the best method of diagnosing\r\ntuberculosis that has been discovered. It is much better than any test\r\nknown for pleuropneumonia when that disease was eradicated.\r\n\r\nPractically all the animals that react are affected with tuberculosis and\r\nshould be separated from the herd, not only in the interest of the public,\r\nbut in the interest of the owner of the herd. The best authorities admit,\r\nafter studying many thousands of tests, that there are few, if any,\r\nmistakes made in condemning cattle which show a typical tuberculin\r\nreaction. The errors are principally in the other direction--that is, some\r\ntuberculous animals are not discovered by the tuberculin test, but as the\r\nmost dangerous of these may be picked out by ordinary clinical examination\r\nthis fault of tuberculin is not so serious as it at first sight appears.\r\nThis being the case, it should not be necessary to force the tuberculin\r\ntest upon owners. They should be anxious to adopt it in their own interests\r\nand for the protection of their patrons. There is to-day no greater danger\r\nto the cattle and hog industries than that which confronts them in the form\r\nof tuberculosis, a disease already widespread and rapidly extending.\r\nFurthermore, in view of the results revealed by numerous tests covering\r\nvast numbers of animals, tuberculin must be considered as harmless for\r\nhealthy animals. It has also been clearly demonstrated that tuberculin\r\ninterferes in no way with the milking function in healthy cattle; neither\r\nin the quantity of milk nor in butter-fat value has any variation been\r\ndetected. The conclusions of some of the best authorities on the subject of\r\nits harmlessness to healthy animals are given below.\r\n\r\nNocard and Leclainche state:\r\n\r\n  Direct experiments and observations collected by thousands show that the\r\n  tuberculin injections have no unfavorable effect. With healthy animals\r\n  the system is indifferent to the inoculation; with tuberculous animals it\r\n  causes slight changes which are not at all serious.\r\n\r\nBang has written as follows on this question:\r\n\r\n  We will now consider the following question, a very important one, in the\r\n  application of tuberculin, viz: Can the reaction produce a worse\r\n  condition in tuberculous animals than before existed? Hess emphatically\r\n  states that it can, and on this account he earnestly warns against its\r\n  application. My attention has been directed to this question from the\r\n  beginning. In my first publication on tuberculin injection I reported two\r\n  cases in which acute miliary tuberculosis was proved in two high-grade\r\n  tuberculous cows several weeks after the tuberculin injection. I then\r\n  stated my suspicion that perhaps the tuberculin injection had some\r\n  connection with this, just as is often supposed to be the case in human\r\n  practice. With my present very large amount of material for observation\r\n  at hand I may express the following opinion: Such an acute development of\r\n  tuberculosis as a result of tuberculin injection is to be feared only\r\n  exceptionally, and then in cases of advanced tuberculosis. _It must not\r\n  be forgotten that acute miliary tuberculosis by no means rarely\r\n  accompanies an advanced tuberculosis of long standing._ It is therefore\r\n  impossible to offer strict proof of the causal connection with the\r\n  injection, and only oft-repeated observation could make this probable.\r\n  In support of my view I offer the following: In the course of the last\r\n  three years I have made careful post-mortem examinations of 83\r\n  tuberculous animals, which have been removed from my experiment farm,\r\n  Thurebylille. Among these were 18 (or, strictly speaking, 23) high-grade\r\n  tuberculous animals. I have been able to prove miliary tuberculosis in\r\n  only 4 of these. Among the others, which showed less developed\r\n  tuberculosis, I have never found miliary tuberculosis, and with very many\r\n  I have never found any sign of a more rapid development of the process.\r\n  On the contrary, it has been proved that the disease was restricted\r\n  locally, often for years, in spite of yearly repeated injections.\r\n  Dissections were made at very different periods after the injections--in\r\n  17 cases from 4 to 12 days after the last test. In all of these cases\r\n  earlier tests had been made months or years before. In 28 cases the\r\n  injection took place from 19 days to 2 months before the butchering; in 3\r\n  of these cases earlier injections had been made. In 38 cases from two and\r\n  one-half months to one year intervened between the last injection and the\r\n  dissection. Dissection gives the best explanation of this question, but a\r\n  clinical observation, continued for years, of a herd tested with\r\n  tuberculin can render very essential aid. If Hess's opinion is correct,\r\n  it is to be assumed that tuberculosis must take an unusually vicious\r\n  course in such herds, but this I have been unable to prove. At\r\n  Thurebylille there has existed for three years a reacting division,\r\n  consisting originally of 131 head and now 69. Although these animals are\r\n  yearly tested, and although most of them react every year, the division\r\n  certainly appears to be made up of healthy animals, and the farm\r\n  inspector has expressed the decided opinion that the tuberculosis in this\r\n  division is no more developed than at the beginning of the experiment.\r\n  The testimony of many owners of large herds of cattle which have long ago\r\n  been injected is to the same effect. I will adduce statements from\r\n  several. A farm tenant whose cattle were injected 20 months previously,\r\n  when 82 per cent of the grown animals reacted, wrote me recently as\r\n  follows: \"Only 2 cows from the division of 100 head had been sold as\r\n  decidedly tuberculous. The majority appeared afterwards, just as before,\r\n  entirely healthy. The fat animals which had been slaughtered had been\r\n  pronounced healthy by the butchers.\" Another farm tenant with a herd\r\n  injected in 1894 had not been obliged to remove a single animal from the\r\n  tuberculosis division, numbering 70 head. A large farm owner in Jutland\r\n  stated in September that he had traced no undesirable result from the\r\n  injection. His herd of 350 had been injected in February and about 75 per\r\n  cent reacted. Similar answers have been given by other owners and\r\n  veterinarians.\r\n\r\n  A veterinarian who had injected 600 animals, among them a herd of a large\r\n  farm, 18 months previously, expressed the belief that the injection had\r\n  produced in no single case an unusually rapid or vicious course of\r\n  tuberculosis. In spite of a demand made months ago, I have received thus\r\n  far no report from any veterinarian of an undesirable result.\r\n\r\n  On a large farm, on which before the injection tuberculosis had appeared\r\n  in a vicious form, the owner had the impression that the severe cases had\r\n  afterwards become more numerous. He had, however, not suffered severe\r\n  losses, and 8 months later the large reacting division by no means made a\r\n  bad impression. Finally, it is to be noticed that tuberculin has been\r\n  employed on a large scale in Denmark for years, and still the demand from\r\n  farmers constantly increases. This could certainly not be the case if the\r\n  injections were generally followed by bad results.\r\n\r\nPaige said, after the tests of the herd of the Massachusetts Agricultural\r\nCollege, that \"its use is not followed by any ill effects of a serious or\r\npermanent nature.\"\r\n\r\nLamson, of the New Hampshire College Agricultural Experiment Station, said:\r\n\"There is abundant testimony that its use is not in any way injurious to a\r\nhealthy animal.\"\r\n\r\nConn, who made a special study of the present attitude of European science\r\ntoward tuberculosis in cattle, reached the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n  It has been, from the first, thought by some that the use of tuberculin\r\n  produces a direct injury upon the inoculated animals. This, however, is\r\n  undoubtedly a mistake, and there is no longer any belief anywhere on the\r\n  part of scientists that the injury thus produced is worthy of note. In\r\n  the first place, the idea that it may produce the disease in a perfectly\r\n  healthy animal by the inoculation is absolutely fallacious. The\r\n  tuberculin does not contain the tubercle bacillus, and it is absolutely\r\n  certain that it is impossible to produce a case of tuberculosis in an\r\n  animal unless the tubercle bacilli are present. The use of tuberculin,\r\n  therefore, certainly can never produce the disease in the inoculated\r\n  animal.\r\n\r\n  It has been more widely believed, however, that the inoculation of an\r\n  animal with this material has a tendency to stimulate an incipient case\r\n  of tuberculosis. It has been thought that an animal with a very slight\r\n  case of the disease may, after inoculation, show a very rapid extension\r\n  of this disease and be speedily brought to a condition where it is\r\n  beyond any use. The reasons given for this have been the apparent\r\n  activity of the tuberculosis infection in animals that have been\r\n  slaughtered shortly after inoculation. This has been claimed, not only\r\n  by agriculturists who have not understood the subject well, but also by\r\n  veterinarians and bacteriologists. But here, too, we must recognize that\r\n  the claim has been disproved, and that there is now a practical\r\n  unanimity of opinion on the part of all who are best calculated to judge\r\n  that such an injurious effect does not occur. Even those who have been\r\n  most pronounced in the claim that there is injury thus resulting from\r\n  tuberculin have, little by little, modified their claim, until at the\r\n  present time they say either that the injury which they formerly claimed\r\n  does not occur or that the stimulus of the disease is so slight that it\r\n  should be absolutely neglected in view of the great value which may\r\n  arise from the use of tuberculin. Apart from two or three who hold this\r\n  very moderate opinion, all bacteriologists and veterinarians unite in\r\n  agreeing that there is no evidence for believing that any injury\r\n  results. In Denmark, especially, many hundreds of thousands of animals\r\n  have been inoculated, and the veterinarians say there is absolutely no\r\n  reason in all their experience for believing that the tuberculin\r\n  inoculation is followed by any injurious results.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 tuberculosis was found in the large Shorthorn herd belonging to W.\r\nC. Edwards, of Canada, who with commendable promptness and public spirit\r\nhad his animals tested, and at once proceeded to separate the diseased from\r\nthe healthy animals. They were all finely bred animals, and of the very\r\nclass which we have been told are most susceptible to the injurious effects\r\nof tuberculin. After using this test regularly for two years, Mr. Edwards\r\nwrote as follows:\r\n\r\n  I have seen nothing to lead me to believe that the tuberculin test had\r\n  any injurious influence on the course of the disease. It is by no means\r\n  our opinion that the disease has been stimulated or aggravated by the\r\n  application of the tuberculin test. All animals that we have tested two\r\n  or three times continue as hale and hearty as they were previously, and\r\n  not one animal in our herds has broken down or failed in any way since\r\n  we began testing.\r\n\r\nMr. Edwards, in December, 1901, verbally stated that his views as to the\r\nharmlessness of tuberculin remained unchanged, and that he had not seen the\r\nleast ill effect in any of his cattle from its use.\r\n\r\nThose who have had most experience with tuberculin have failed to observe\r\nany injurious effects following its use upon healthy cattle. With\r\ntuberculous cattle it produces a fever of short duration, and in the great\r\nmajority of cases all derangement of the system which it causes disappears\r\nwithin 48 hours after the tuberculin is administered. There appear to have\r\nbeen a very few cases in which the disease was aggravated, and a greater\r\nnumber in which it was benefited by the injection of tuberculin. The cases\r\nof abortion following the tuberculin test have not been numerous, even when\r\ncows were tested within a few weeks of the normal time of calving. The few\r\ncases of this kind which have occurred may be explained by the fact that\r\nabortion in cattle is a very common occurrence, and that it would\r\ninevitably happen sometimes after the tuberculin test as a mere coincidence\r\nand without any relation between the test and the loss of the calf. The\r\ncases of abortion which have been cited appear to be no more numerous than\r\nmight be expected to have occurred among the same number of cattle within\r\nthe same period if the test had not been applied.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there is ample evidence to show that tuberculin is the\r\nmost reliable means of detecting tuberculosis in the living animal and that\r\nits use is not attended by any harmful aftereffects.\r\n\r\nAn act of Congress was approved July 24, 1919, for the purpose of\r\ncontrolling and eradicating tuberculosis of animals. The official means of\r\ndetecting tuberculosis in the living animal is the tuberculin test, which\r\nmay be applied by three different methods--the subcutaneous, the\r\nintradermic, and the ophthalmic. It is not necessary to discuss here the\r\ndetails of these three methods, which are made use of in the work of\r\neradication of tuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe plan adopted by the State and Federal authorities in eradication of the\r\ndisease is known as \"The Accredited-Herd Plan.\" Under this plan herds are\r\ntested under State and Federal supervision, the diseased animals are\r\nappraised, removed, and slaughtered under Federal inspection. Retests are\r\nthen made after definite periods of time until two successive tests show\r\nall the animals to be free from the disease. At this time the herd owner is\r\ngiven a certificate of an accredited herd.\r\n\r\nDetails concerning the accredited-herd plan may be obtained by applying to\r\nthe Chief of the Bureau of Animal Industry, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TUBERCULIN TESTS.\r\n\r\nTesting animals with tuberculin is the process of introducing tuberculin\r\ninto the animal and interpreting results according to well-known\r\nstandards.\r\n\r\nFrom the investigations and observations that have been mentioned, it may\r\nbe safely concluded--\r\n\r\n1. That the tuberculin test is a wonderfully accurate method of\r\ndetermining whether an animal is affected with tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n2. That by its use the animals diseased with tuberculosis may be detected\r\nand removed from the herd, thereby eradicating the disease.\r\n\r\n3. That it has no injurious effect upon healthy cattle.\r\n\r\n4. That the comparatively small number of cattle which have aborted,\r\nsuffered in health, or fallen off in condition after the test were either\r\ndiseased before it was made or were affected by some cause other than the\r\ntuberculin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUBCUTANEOUS TEST (UNDER THE SKIN).\r\n\r\nThe most frequently used method of testing is the subcutaneous test, which\r\nconsists in injecting the proper quantity of tuberculin underneath the skin\r\ninto the subcutaneous tissue. If an animal is tuberculous, the action of\r\nthe tuberculin causes a fever, which is indicated by a rise in temperature.\r\nThis rise, under ordinary conditions, may occur any time between the eighth\r\nand twentieth hours after the tuberculin is injected, but in some cases it\r\nis desirable to measure the temperature before the eighth hour and continue\r\nto the twenty-fourth hour or longer.\r\n\r\nThe temperatures are measured at least 3 times in advance of the injection,\r\nat 2-hour intervals, to learn whether the animal is in proper condition to\r\nreceive the test. The temperatures after injection are taken every 2 hours\r\nuntil the test is completed. The proper interpretation of the temperatures\r\nis made by the person applying the test, and a careful observance of any\r\nclinical changes is always important in determining the result. It can not\r\nbe set forth too strongly that the test, including the two following\r\nmethods, should be attempted only by those who are properly qualified to do\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTRADERMIC TEST (INTO THE SKIN).\r\n\r\nThe intradermic test for detecting tuberculosis is used to a considerable\r\nextent, especially in area work and on range cattle not easily controlled.\r\nWhen made by those who have become skilled in its application, it is very\r\naccurate. In this test the tuberculin is injected between the layers of the\r\nskin, only a few drops being used, and it is usually applied in the region\r\nat the base of the tail, where the skin is soft and nearly hairless. The\r\nintradermic test is satisfactory also for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in\r\nswine and, when so used, the tuberculin is applied into the skin of the ear\r\nnear its base.\r\n\r\nThe reaction from the intradermic test consists of a swelling at the point\r\nof injection and is observed from 72 to 150 hours after the injection. The\r\ncharacter of the swelling varies, and a proper diagnosis of tuberculosis by\r\nthis test can be made only by an experienced person.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OPHTHALMIC TEST (INTO THE EYE).\r\n\r\nStill another method, known as the ophthalmic test, is used quite\r\nfrequently and has been found to be of considerable value in what is known\r\nas \"check\" testing; that is, it is used in connection with either of the\r\npreviously described methods. Sometimes a tuberculous animal that fails to\r\nreact to those tests shows evidence of the disease upon the application of\r\nthe ophthalmic test. The ophthalmic tuberculin is placed in one eye and the\r\nother eye is used as a check. A reaction is indicated by a characteristic\r\ndischarge from the eye receiving the treatment, which may occur in from 3\r\nto 10 hours after the application or even later. Some swelling and\r\ninflammation of the eye and lids are often noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF TUBERCULOSIS.\r\n\r\nTreatment of the disease is not seriously considered by any authorities at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\nThe measures to be adopted to prevent the spreading of the disease must\r\ntake into consideration not only the tubercle bacillus, but likewise all\r\nthose circumstances that make cattle more susceptible to the disease, and\r\nwhich have already been dwelt upon. It would be useless to repeat here all\r\nthat has been said above on the transmission of tubercle bacilli from one\r\nanimal to another, and on the dangers of certain debilitating influences. A\r\ncareful study of these influences will show how tuberculosis may, at least\r\nin some cases, be prevented. Great care should be bestowed upon the\r\nbreeding, the surroundings, and the feed of the animal, so that the latter\r\nmay be put into a condition to resist infection even when exposed to it. A\r\ntuberculin test should be applied to all strange cattle before they are\r\nintroduced into the herd, and those which show a reaction should be\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nA rigid exclusion of tuberculous animals is all that is necessary to\r\nprevent the appearance of the disease, provided cattle are not infected by\r\nconsumptive persons and animals. The transmission of the disease from man\r\nto cattle is probably not frequent, but is regarded as a possible source of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis in cattle must also be considered as bearing upon tuberculosis\r\nof other domesticated animals, particularly hogs. In Europe and the United\r\nStates this disease is not uncommon among hogs, and appears to be on the\r\nincrease. The reason for its existence may be looked for in the feeding of\r\npigs with skim milk, buttermilk, and whey from creameries, with the offal\r\nof the abattoirs, with the household refuse generally, and behind\r\ntuberculous cattle. If tuberculosis is common among cattle, it is likely to\r\nbe transmitted to hogs kept in this way.\r\n\r\nThe carcasses of animals which have died of tuberculosis should be buried\r\ndeeply so that they can not be eaten by other animals. This is likewise\r\ntrue of all organs or tissues of slaughtered animals containing tubercles.\r\nThese should never be fed to other animals, such as hogs, dogs, and cats,\r\nand should either be destroyed by fire or deeply buried.\r\n\r\nWhen any of the animals in a herd of cattle show evident symptoms of\r\ntuberculosis, or when the tuberculin test proves that they are affected\r\nwith this disease, the best method of procedure in most cases is to have\r\nthe affected animals slaughtered and the stables disinfected. A large\r\nproportion of the animals which are slightly affected yield carcasses which\r\nare perfectly wholesome and fit for human food, but in all such cases there\r\nshould be an inspection by an expert at the time of slaughter to determine\r\nwhich carcasses may be used and which should be destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe disinfection of stables may be accomplished by thoroughly cleaning\r\nthem, scrubbing the floors with hot water, brushing down all loose dust\r\nfrom the walls, and tearing off all woodwork which is partly decayed. Then\r\nthe whole interior of the stable should be covered with a good coat of\r\nlimewash containing 1 part of formalin (which is a 40 per cent watery\r\nsolution of formaldehyde) to 30 parts of the lime wash, or 4 ounces of\r\nformalin to each gallon of lime wash.\r\n\r\nSimilar precautions should be observed in removing the manure of the\r\ninfected herd from the barnyard and other places accessible to cattle,\r\nsince it is known that tuberculous cattle frequently eliminate large\r\nnumbers of tubercle bacilli through the feces. The ground under the manure\r\npile should then be disinfected, either by the above-mentioned formalin\r\nsolution or by unslaked lime thickly sprinkled over the soil.\r\n\r\nIf all the animals which react are destroyed and the stables disinfected in\r\nthis manner, the herd should remain free from the disease unless other\r\naffected animals are added to it. The introduction of the disease in this\r\nmanner may be avoided by requiring a tuberculin test of all new animals\r\nadmitted on the premises.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it is a fact that tuberculous animals which have been tested\r\nseveral times may become so accustomed to tuberculin that they will no\r\nlonger react; consequently it is always advisable to purchase cattle from\r\nsome one who is known to be reliable, as otherwise animals of this kind may\r\nbe treated with tuberculin for the purpose of hiding the disease.\r\n\r\nIn the case of very valuable purebred animals and under exceptional\r\ncircumstances it may be more advantageous to retain the reacting animals\r\nwhich are in good condition in order to breed from them and in that manner\r\navoid the excessive loss which would follow from their immediate slaughter.\r\nThis may be done if proper precautions are adopted.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of reactors depends upon the State laws and live-stock\r\nregulations of the State in which the herd belongs. If this policy is\r\nfollowed it should be attempted only after careful study of the plan known\r\nas the Bang method of controlling tuberculosis. The live-stock officials of\r\nthe State should be frequently consulted and their advice followed;\r\notherwise failure will surely ensue. The plan necessitates considerable\r\ntrouble and is not recommended except under the circumstances mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOVINE TUBERCULOSIS AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH.\r\n\r\nThe increasing amount of evidence pointing to the identity of human and\r\nanimal tuberculosis, combined with the extraordinary mortality of human\r\nbeings from this disease, often amounting to 10 to 14 per cent, has raised\r\nthe question in all civilized countries as to how far animal, and\r\nespecially bovine, tuberculosis is to blame for this high mortality. The\r\nmedical and veterinary professions have approached this problem with equal\r\nzeal, and much has come to light within recent years which enables us to\r\ncome to some conclusion. If this disease is transmitted from animals to\r\nman, how does the transmission take place? As comparatively few people come\r\nin direct contact with tuberculous cattle, it must be either through the\r\nmeat, the milk, the butter, the cheese, or through all these products that\r\nthe virus enters the human body. The question has thus narrowed itself down\r\nto the food products furnished by cattle.\r\n\r\nIt has become a very urgent question, especially in the poorer countries of\r\nEurope, whether all flesh from tuberculous animals is unfit for human food.\r\nIt is argued there that if it can be shown that in the majority of cases of\r\ntuberculosis the bones and the muscular system are free from infection,\r\nthere is no reason why the meat should not be put on sale under certain\r\nrestrictions. The question may be resolved into two divisions: (1) How\r\nfrequently does the disease invade those parts of the body which are used\r\nas food? (2) When the disease process is manifestly restricted to the\r\ninternal organs, do tubercle bacilli circulate in the blood and lymph and\r\ncan they be detected in the muscular tissue?\r\n\r\n(1) Disease of the bones is not unknown, although very rare. According to\r\nWalley, it appears chiefly in the spongy bones of the head and backbone and\r\nin the long bones of the limbs. Occasionally the ends of the bones, where\r\nthey are covered by the synovial membrane of the joints, are dotted with\r\ntubercles. The muscular system itself is very rarely the seat of\r\ntuberculous deposits, although the lymphatic glands lying near and among\r\nthe muscles may be not infrequently diseased.\r\n\r\n(2) Whether tubercle bacilli are found in muscle juice independent of any\r\ntuberculous deposits is a question which must be approached experimentally.\r\nThere is on record a great variety of opinions on this matter, some\r\nauthorities considering all flesh from tuberculous animals unfit for food,\r\nwhile others hold a contrary view. Experiments have shown that in rare\r\ncases the flesh of tuberculous cattle contains a small number of tubercle\r\nbacilli. In Germany the flesh of animals in which the disease is just\r\nbeginning, or in which it is restricted to one or more related organs, is\r\nnot rejected. When, however, the disease has affected the muscles or bones,\r\nor lymphatic glands situated on or between them, the flesh is condemned as\r\nunfit and dangerous. Animals are also rejected in which it is evident, from\r\nthe general distribution of tubercles throughout the various organs, that\r\nthe bacilli have been distributed by the blood and may have been carried\r\ninto the muscular system (generalized tuberculosis).\r\n\r\nConcerning the infectious nature of milk secreted by tuberculous cows,\r\nauthorities have universally agreed that when the udder itself is in the\r\nslightest degree involved the milk possesses infectious properties, and is\r\ntherefore dangerous. Tubercle bacilli in large numbers have been found in\r\nthe milk and the udder under such circumstances. Unlike other affections of\r\nthe udder, tuberculosis of this organ does not at once change the\r\nappearance and the quality of the milk secreted. Bang states that for at\r\nleast a month after the disease has appeared the milk is normal in\r\nappearance and may be consumed and sold without arousing the suspicion of\r\nthe owner. Considerable danger is, therefore, involved in this disease, and\r\nthe necessity for the careful inspection of dairy cows seems more urgent\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\nAuthorities are, however, not fully agreed as to whether the milk from\r\ntuberculous cows in which the udder is apparently not invaded by the\r\ndisease should be considered dangerous or not. Some incline to the belief\r\nthat the milk secreted by healthy udders is never infectious, even when the\r\nlungs or other organs are affected; that, in other words, the tubercle\r\nbacilli are rarely, if ever, separated from the lesions which they produce,\r\nand that the udder itself must be diseased before tubercle bacilli can\r\nappear in the milk. Experiments made with the milk of tuberculous cows in\r\nwhich there were no indications of udder disease do not bear out this\r\ntheory, since tubercle bacilli have been found in their milk. Some\r\nauthorities still believe that the udder is diseased when the milk is\r\ninfected, but that the disease escapes observation. However this may be,\r\nthe fact that the udder may be diseased and the disease not recognizable\r\nsimply casts suspicion upon all milk from tuberculous animals. We know that\r\nthe milk of tuberculous cattle may or may not contain tubercle bacilli when\r\nthe udder is apparently free from disease, but we have no rapid method of\r\ndetermining whether in any given case the milk contains tubercle bacilli or\r\nnot. Moreover, the bacilli may be absent at one time and present at another\r\nin milk from the same cow. When we consider, therefore, the extent of\r\ntuberculosis and the hidden character of the disease, a certain degree of\r\nsuspicion rests upon all milk from untested cattle. Fortunately, tubercle\r\nbacilli are readily destroyed by the temperature of boiling water, and\r\nhence both meat and milk are made safe, the former by the various processes\r\nof cooking, the latter by boiling for a few moments. It is incumbent upon\r\nall communities to have dairy cows examined and tested with tuberculin. If\r\ndisease is detected, the affected animal should be killed at once or else\r\nall opportunity for the sale of such milk removed by appropriate measures.\r\nWhere milk or cream is sold to the trade in large towns or cities\r\npasteurization should be required as an additional safeguard.\r\n\r\nRecently there has been much discussion of the question as to whether human\r\nand animal tuberculosis are identical diseases and as to the possibility of\r\nthe tuberculosis of animals being transmitted to man or that of man being\r\ntransmitted to animals.\r\n\r\nThe fact that tuberculous material from human subjects often failed to\r\nproduce serious disease in cattle was observed by a number of the earlier\r\ninvestigators who experimented with such virus. It was the experiments and\r\ncomparative studies of Theobald Smith, however, which attracted special\r\nattention to the difference in virulence shown by tubercle bacilli from\r\nhuman and bovine sources when inoculated upon cattle. Smith mentioned also\r\ncertain morphological and cultural differences in bacilli from these two\r\nsources, and in the location and histology of the lesions in cattle\r\nproduced by such bacilli. He did not conclude, however, that bovine bacilli\r\ncould not produce disease in the human subject, but said:\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that, accepting the clinical evidence on hand, bovine\r\ntuberculosis may be transmitted to children when the body is overpowered by\r\nlarge numbers of bacilli, as in udder tuberculosis, or when certain unknown\r\nfavorable conditions exist.\r\n\r\nKoch, however, in his address at the British Congress on Tuberculosis, went\r\nfar beyond this and maintained that \"human tuberculosis differs from bovine\r\nand can not be transmitted to cattle.\" As to the susceptibility of man to\r\nbovine tuberculosis, he said it was not yet absolutely decided, but one was\r\n\"nevertheless already at liberty to say that, if such a susceptibility\r\nreally exists, the infection of human beings is but a very rare\r\noccurrence.\" He emphasizes this view in the following language:\r\n\r\n  I should estimate the extent of infection by the milk and flesh of\r\n  tubercular cattle and the butter made of their milk as hardly greater than\r\n  that of hereditary transmission, and I therefore do not deem it advisable\r\n  to take any measures against it.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was so radically different from the views of most\r\nexperimenters and so out of harmony with facts which had apparently been\r\ndemonstrated by others that it at once aroused opposition in the congress,\r\nfollowed by the adoption of dissenting resolutions, and led to numerous\r\ninvestigations in various countries. Koch's conclusions were based upon his\r\nfailure to produce tuberculosis in cattle and other animals by inoculating\r\nthem with tuberculous material of human origin and his success in causing\r\nprogressive and fatal tuberculosis in the same kinds of animals when\r\ninoculated with tuberculous material of bovine origin. With such\r\npositiveness did he hold to the constant and specific difference between\r\nthe human and bovine bacillus that he promulgated an experimental method of\r\ndiscriminating between them. Speaking of the etiology of intestinal\r\ntuberculosis in man, he said:\r\n\r\nHitherto nobody could decide with certainty in such a case whether the\r\ntuberculosis of the intestine was of human or of animal origin. Now we can\r\ndiagnose them. All that is necessary is to cultivate in pure culture the\r\ntubercle bacilli found in the tubercular material, and to ascertain whether\r\nthey belong to bovine tuberculosis by inoculating cattle with them. For\r\nthis purpose I recommend subcutaneous injection, which yields quite\r\nspecially characteristic and convincing results.\r\n\r\nThese important and comprehensive conclusions followed from a comparatively\r\nfew experiments upon animals, and apparently no effort had been made to\r\nlearn to what extent human tubercle bacilli may differ in their virulence\r\nfor cattle or what grades of virulence there might be among bacilli of\r\nbovine origin. Vagedes had already shown that bacilli were sometimes\r\npresent in human lesions which were as virulent as bovine bacilli, but his\r\nwork was wholly ignored by Koch.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of investigators, including Chauveau, Vagedes,\r\nRavenel, De Schweinitz, Mohler, De Jong, DelÈpine, Orth, Stenstrˆm, Fibiger\r\nand Jensen, Max Wolff, Nocard, Arloing, Behring, Dean and Todd, Hamilton\r\nand Young, the German Tuberculosis Commission, and Theobald Smith, have\r\nfound tubercle bacilli in the bodies of human beings who died of\r\ntuberculosis which proved to have about the same virulence for cattle as\r\nhad the bacilli from bovine animals affected by the disease.\r\n\r\nKossel, in a preliminary report, stated that the German commission had\r\ntested 7 cultures of tuberculosis from cattle and hogs--4 from cattle and 3\r\nfrom hogs. Two proved acutely fatal in cattle after eight to nine weeks; 4\r\nlikewise produced a generalized tuberculosis, but which certainly had a\r\nmore chronic course, while 1 of the cultures caused only an infiltration at\r\nthe point of inoculation, with some caseous foci in the adjoining\r\nprescapular gland and in one of the mediastinal glands, and there was\r\nlacking the spreading of the tuberculosis over the entire body which they\r\nwere accustomed to see after the injection of cultures of bovine\r\ntuberculosis. \"Hence,\" says Kossel, \"among bovine tuberculosis bacilli\r\nthere can also occur differences with regard to the virulence.\"\r\n\r\nThe German commission also tested 39 different freshly made cultures from\r\ntuberculous disease in man. Nineteen did not produce the slightest symptoms\r\nin cattle; with 9 others the cattle exhibited after four months very minute\r\nfoci in the prescapular glands, which were mostly encapsuled and showed no\r\ninclination to progress; with 7 other cases there was somewhat more marked\r\ndisease of the prescapular glands, but it did not go so far as a material\r\nspreading of the process to the adjoining glands. There were 4 cultures,\r\nhowever, which were more virulent and caused generalized tuberculosis in\r\nthe cattle inoculated with them.\r\n\r\nIt would appear, therefore, that hereafter everyone must admit that it is\r\nimpossible always to tell the source of a culture of the tubercle bacillus\r\nby its effect when it is inoculated upon cattle. One of the bovine cultures\r\nfailed to produce generalized tuberculosis in cattle, and some of the human\r\ncultures did produce it in such animals. Moreover, while some of the human\r\ncultures caused no disease at all, others led to the development of minute\r\nfoci in the prescapular glands, and still others to somewhat more marked\r\ndisease of the glands. There were, consequently, four degrees of virulence\r\nnoted in these 39 cultures of bacilli from human sources and three degrees\r\nof virulence in the 7 cultures from animal.\r\n\r\nNow, if we accept the views of Koch as to the specific difference between\r\nhuman and bovine tubercle bacilli, and that the human bacilli produce only\r\nlocalized lesions in cattle, while bovine bacilli produce generalized\r\nlesions in them, must we not conclude that the one non-virulent bovine\r\nculture was in reality of human origin, and that the animal from which it\r\nwas obtained had been infected from man? This is a logical deduction, but\r\nreverses the dictum laid down at London that human tuberculosis is not\r\ntransmissible to cattle. Again, how are we to explain the human cultures of\r\nmedium virulence? Are they human bacilli which, for some unknown reason,\r\nare increasing in virulence and approaching the activity of the bovine\r\nbacillus, or are they really bovine bacilli which have multiplied in the\r\nhuman body until their virulence has become attenuated? In whatever manner\r\nthese questions are decided it would seem that the findings of the German\r\ncommission, instead of supporting Koch's views that we can decide with\r\ncertainty by the inoculation of cattle as to the source of any given\r\nbacillus, really show that this method of diagnosis is extremely uncertain\r\nin the present condition of our knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt is definitely admitted that 4 of the human cultures caused generalized\r\ntuberculosis in cattle; Kossel suggest, however, that it may be possible\r\nthat the bacilli in cases of human tuberculosis under certain circumstances\r\ncan likewise attain a very high pathogenic activity for cattle without\r\nbeing for that reason bovine bacilli. Undoubtedly the German commission is\r\nconfronting the two horns of a dilemma, either one of which is fatal to the\r\nviews of Koch as stated with such positiveness at London. If we accept this\r\nsuggestion thrown out by Kossel, we must conclude that Koch was wrong in\r\nhis claim that human tuberculosis can not be transmitted to cattle, and\r\nthus with one blow we destroy the entire experimental support which he had\r\nfor his argument before the British Congress on Tuberculosis. If, on the\r\nother hand, we accept the conclusion which follows from the principle laid\r\ndown by Koch for the discrimination between human and bovine bacilli, and\r\nwhich appears to be favored by Kossel, we must admit that bovine\r\ntuberculosis is an extremely important factor in the etiology of human\r\ntuberculosis. Of the 39 cases of human tuberculosis tested, 4, or more than\r\n10 per cent, were virulent for cattle and would be classified as of bovine\r\norigin; however, these 4 cases, were all found among the 16 cases of\r\ntuberculosis in children which the commission investigated; hence it is\r\nplain that 25 per cent of the cases tested of tuberculosis in children\r\nwould by Koch's method be classified as of bovine origin.\r\n\r\nIn the Bureau of Animal Industry two distinct lines of experiments have\r\nbeen carried on, in order that one might serve as a check against the\r\nother. There has been, however, no discrepancy in the results. De\r\nSchweinitz, in the Biochemic Division, Bureau of Animal Industry, isolated\r\n9 cultures from human tuberculosis. Two were derived from human sputum, 3\r\nfrom cases of generalized tuberculosis in adults, and 4 from cases of\r\ngeneralized tuberculosis in children. By comparing these cultures with a\r\nnewly isolated virulent culture of bovine tuberculosis, there were found\r\namong them 2 cultures from children which were identical in their cultural\r\nand morphological characters with the bovine bacillus. These cultures also\r\nkilled rabbits and guinea pigs in as short a time as did the bovine\r\nbacillus. Hogs which were inoculated subcutaneously with these 2 cultures\r\nfrom children died of generalized tuberculosis. Two calves weighing more\r\nthan 300 pounds each were inoculated subcutaneously with these virulent\r\nhuman cultures, and as a result developed generalized tuberculosis. A\r\nyearling heifer inoculated with 1 of the cultures showed generalized\r\ntuberculosis when killed three months after inoculation. Both the cattle\r\nand the hogs had been tested with tuberculin and found to be free from\r\ntuberculosis before the inoculations were made. It is important to observe\r\nin this connection that 2 out of 4, or 50 per cent, of the cultures\r\nobtained from cases of generalized tuberculosis in children proved virulent\r\nfor cattle.\r\n\r\nMohler, working in the Pathological Division, Bureau of Animal Industry,\r\nobtained 3 very virulent cultures of tubercle bacilli from the human\r\nsubject. A goat inoculated subcutaneously with 1 of these cultures died in\r\n37 days with miliary tuberculosis of the lungs involving the axillary and\r\nprescapular glands. This bacillus was obtained from the mesenteric gland of\r\na boy. Of still greater interest is a bacillus isolated by Mohler from\r\nhuman sputum. A goat inoculated subcutaneously with a culture of this germ\r\ndied in 95 days of pulmonary tuberculosis. A cat inoculated in the same\r\nmanner died in 23 days of generalized tuberculosis. A rabbit similarly\r\ninoculated died in 59 days of pulmonary tuberculosis. Another rabbit\r\ninoculated with a bovine culture for comparison lived 10 days longer than\r\nthe one inoculated with this sputum germ. Mohler also inoculated\r\nsubcutaneously a 1-year-old heifer with a culture derived from the\r\ntuberculosis mesenteric gland of a boy 4 years of age. This culture was\r\nalways refractory in its growth under artificial conditions, and the\r\nbacilli were short, stubby rods, corresponding in appearance to the bovine\r\ntype. At the autopsy, held 127 days after the inoculation, the general\r\ncondition was seen to be poor and unthrifty, and large, hard tumors were\r\nfound at the points of inoculation. On the right side the swelling measured\r\n3-1/2 by 5 inches, and the corresponding lymph gland was 2-3/4 inches long\r\nby 1-3/4 inches in diameter. This gland contained numerous calcareous foci;\r\none at the apex was an inch in diameter. The lesions on the left shoulder\r\nof the animal were very similar to those found on the right side, but the\r\ndimensions of the tumor were slightly less. The lungs presented an\r\nirregular mass of tuberculous nodules, and 7 or 8 grapelike nodules were\r\nseen on the parietal pleura. Bronchial and mediastinal lymph glands\r\ncontained numerous tuberculous foci, and the pericardium, peritoneum,\r\nspleen, and liver also were affected.\r\n\r\nIn order to throw some light, if possible, upon the morphological constancy\r\nof the different types of tubercle bacilli, Mohler made comparative studies\r\nof bacilli from various sources, and which had been passed through various\r\nspecies of animals, by making the cultures upon dog serum after the method\r\ndescribed by Theobald Smith. Some important results have been obtained. One\r\nculture of human bacilli which had morphological and cultural peculiarities\r\nsimilar to those of the bovine bacillus, and which produced only local\r\nlesions in cattle, was passed through a series of five cats. It was then\r\nfound to be completely changed in its morphological characters, the rods\r\nbeing elongated, slender, more or less beaded, and entirely of the human\r\ntype. Far from decreasing in virulence, however, as might be expected from\r\nits morphological appearance, this bacillus had so increased in its\r\npathogenic activity that it produced generalized tuberculosis in a cow.\r\nThis cow was inoculated subcutaneously in front of each shoulder with 2\r\ncubic centimeters of a salt-solution emulsion of the tuberculous omentum of\r\nthe last cat of the series. The cow rapidly lost flesh, had a temperature\r\nof 104∞ F., with the point of inoculation and adjacent glands greatly\r\nswollen. The autopsy revealed generalized tuberculosis, involving the\r\nlungs, mediastinal glands, spleen, liver, and kidneys. Tubercle bacilli of\r\nthe bovine type obtained from the mesenteric glands of a sheep, hog, and\r\ncow were similarly transformed in their morphological appearance after\r\nbeing passed through a series of cats and recovered on dog serum. These\r\nbacilli also increased in virulence, as the last cat in the series\r\ninvariably succumbed in a shorter time than the first of the series.\r\n\r\nThese experiments and observations indicate that the types of tubercle\r\nbacilli are very inconstant, and that under suitable conditions they\r\nreadily change both in morphology and in virulence. A similar conclusion\r\nwas reached by other investigators in working with the avian and porcine\r\ntypes of tubercle bacilli several years ago, and was reasonably to have\r\nbeen expected with the human and bovine types.\r\n\r\nLater investigations made by Park and Krumweide, of the Research Laboratory\r\nof New York City, Novick, Richard M. Smith, Ravenel, Rosenau, Chung Yik\r\nWang, and others tend to show the incidence of bovine infection in the\r\nhuman family. Chung Yik Wang stated in 1917 that studies of 281 cases of\r\nvarious clinical forms of tuberculosis in Edinburgh, Scotland, resulted in\r\nthe isolation of the bovine tubercle bacilli in 78.4 per cent of cases\r\nunder the age of 5 years, in 70.3 per cent between the ages of 5 and 16,\r\nand in 7.8 per cent over the age of 16. This investigator states that from\r\nthe prophylactic point of view any measure resorted to in combating the\r\ndisease should be directed not only against the human spread of infection,\r\nbut also, more particularly in children's cases, against the bovine source\r\nof infection.\r\n\r\nRavenel, in summarizing the work of Drs. Park and Krumweide, as well as\r\nothers throughout the world, gives the following results:\r\n\r\n  Of 63 children dying of tuberculosis at the babies' hospital 59 cases\r\n  proved to be human infection and 4 bovine, a percentage of 6-1/3.\r\n\r\n  Of 9 children dying of tuberculosis at the foundling hospital 4 proved\r\n  to have derived their infection from human sources and 5 from bovine, a\r\n  percentage of 55.\r\n\r\n  Of a total of 88 children under 5 years of age who died of tuberculosis\r\n  77   proved to have derived their infection from human sources and 11\r\n  from bovine, a percentage of 12-1/2.\r\n\r\n  Combining the cases studied in New York with those of other observers in\r\n  different parts of this country and Europe, the following results are\r\n  obtained:\r\n\r\n  Adults, 787 cases--777 human and 10 bovine infection.\r\n\r\n  Children, 5 to 16 years, 153 cases--117 human and 36 bovine infection.\r\n\r\n  Children under 5 years, 280 cases--215 human and 65 bovine infection.\r\n\r\n  The figures of the foundling hospital show the real danger of unprotected\r\n  cows' milk.\r\n\r\n  The conclusion from these studies is inevitable, namely, that in children,\r\n  in addition to the large number of deaths which occur from bovine\r\n  infection, there are many cases of infection resulting in deformities,\r\n  necessitating operations more or less severe in character and which\r\n  frequently leave the patient disfigured permanently.\r\n\r\nIt must be plain to all, from these recent developments, that too much has\r\nbeen made of the slight differences in cultural characteristics, in\r\nmorphology, and in virulence which have been observed in some cases in\r\ncomparing the human and the bovine bacilli. The observations were\r\ninteresting, and it was important that they be followed up until their\r\nsignificance was made entirely clear, but it was an almost unpardonable\r\nerror, from a sanitary point of view, to promulgate sweeping\r\ngeneralizations calculated to arrest and abolish important measures for\r\npreventing human tuberculosis before the soundness of these generalizations\r\nhad been established by a thorough course of experimentation.\r\n\r\nWhen Koch said in the British Congress on Tuberculosis that he should\r\nestimate the extent of infection by the milk and flesh of tuberculous\r\ncattle and the butter made of their milk as hardly greater than that of\r\nhereditary transmission, and that he therefore did not deem it advisable to\r\ntake any measures against it, he went far beyond what was justified by any\r\nexperiments or observations which he reported, and he did a great deal of\r\nharm, which will be manifested for years to come, to those who endeavor to\r\nguard the human race from the dangers of animal tuberculosis. The\r\nresearches which have been alluded to make these dangers more definite and\r\ncertain than they have appeared before, and sanitarians should therefore\r\nmost earnestly endeavor to counteract the erroneous and harmful impression\r\nwhich was made by Koch's address at London and his subsequent address at\r\nthe International Conference on Tuberculosis at Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nVACCINIA OR COWPOX.\r\n\r\nVariola of cattle, more correctly vaccinia, is a contagious disease of\r\ncattle which manifests its presence through an elevation of temperature, a\r\nshrinkage in milk production, and by the appearance of characteristic,\r\npustular eruptions, especially upon the teats and udders of dairy cows.\r\nAlthough this is a contagious disease, strictly speaking, it is so\r\nuniversally harmless and benign in its course that it is robbed of the\r\nterrors which usually accompany all spreading diseases, and is allowed to\r\nenter a herd of cattle, run its course, and disappear without exciting any\r\nparticular notice.\r\n\r\nThe contagion of cowpox does not travel through the air from animal to\r\nanimal, but is transfused only by actual contact of the contagious\r\nprinciple with the skin of some susceptible animal. It may be carried in\r\nthis manner, not alone from cattle to cattle, but horses, sheep, goats, and\r\nman may readily contract the disease whenever suitable conditions attend\r\ntheir inoculation.\r\n\r\nAn identical disease frequently appears upon horses, attacking their heels,\r\nand thence extending upward along the leg, producing, as it progresses,\r\ninflammation and swelling of the skin, followed later by pustules, which\r\nsoon rupture, discharging a sticky, disagreeable secretion. Other parts of\r\nthe body are frequently affected in like manner, especially in the region\r\nof the head, where the eruptions may appear upon lips and nostrils, or upon\r\nthe mucous surfaces of the nasal cavities, mouth, or eyes.\r\n\r\nVariola of the horse is readily transmitted to cattle, if both are cared\r\nfor by the same attendant, and, conversely, variola of cattle may be\r\ncarried from the cow to the horse on the hands of a person who has been\r\nmilking a cow affected with the disease.\r\n\r\nThe method of vaccination with material derived from the eruptions of\r\ncowpox as a safeguard against the ravages of smallpox in members of the\r\nhuman family is well known. The immunity which such vaccination confers\r\nupon the human subject has led many writers to assert that cowpox is simply\r\na modified form of smallpox, whose harmless attack upon the human system is\r\nowing to a certain attenuation derived during its passages through the\r\nsystem of the cow or horse. The results of numerous experiments which have\r\nbeen carried out for the purpose of determining the relationship existing\r\nbetween variola of the human and bovine families seem to show, however,\r\nthat although possessing many similar characteristics, they are\r\nnevertheless distinct, and that in spite of repeated inoculations from\r\ncattle to man, and vice versa, no transformation in the real character of\r\nthe disease ever takes place.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The disease appears in four to seven days after natural\r\ninfection, or may evince itself in two or three days as the result of\r\nartificial inoculation. Young milch cows are most susceptible to an attack,\r\nbut older cows, bulls, or young cattle are by no means immune. The attack\r\ncauses a slight rise in temperature, which is soon followed by the\r\nappearance of reddened, inflamed areas, principally upon the teats and\r\nudder, and at times on the abdominal skin or the skin of the inner surface\r\nof the thighs. In a few cases the skin of the throat and jaws has been\r\nfound similarly involved. If the affected parts are examined on the second\r\nday after the establishment of the inflammation numerous pale-red nodules\r\nwill be found, which gradually expand until, within a few days, they reach\r\na diameter of one-half inch or even larger. At this period the tops of the\r\nnodules become transformed into vesicles which are depressed in the center\r\nand contain a pale, serous fluid. They usually reach their maturity by the\r\ntenth day of the course of the disease and are then the size of a bean.\r\nFrom this time the contents of the vesicles become purulent, which requires\r\nabout three days, when the typical pox pustule is present, consisting of a\r\nswelling with broad, reddened base, within which is an elevated, conical\r\nabscess varying from the size of a pea to that of a hazelnut.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease after the full maturity of the pustule is rapid\r\nif outside interference has not caused a premature rupture of the small\r\nabscess at the apex of the swelling. The pustules gradually become darker\r\ncolored and drier until nothing remains but a thick scab, which at last\r\nfalls off, leaving only a slight, whitish scar behind. The total duration\r\nof the disease covers some 20 days in each animal, and owing to the slow\r\nspread of the infection from animal to animal, many weeks may elapse before\r\na stable can be fully freed from it. The fallen scabs and crusts may retain\r\ntheir contagious properties for several days when mixed with litter and\r\nbedding upon the floor of the stable, and at any time during this period\r\nthey are capable of producing new outbreaks should fresh cattle be brought\r\ninto the stalls and thus come into actual contact with them. Again, the\r\npustules may appear, one after another, on a single animal, in which case\r\nthe duration of the disease is materially lengthened.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In herds of cattle that regularly receive careful handling,\r\nno special treatment will be found necessary beyond the application of\r\nsoftening and disinfecting agents to such vesicles upon the teats as may\r\nhave become ruptured by the hands of the milker. Carbolized vaseline or\r\niodoform ointment will be found well suited to this work. In more\r\npersistent cases it may be found desirable to use a milking tube in order\r\nto prevent the repeated opening of the pustules during the operation of\r\nmilking. Washing the sores twice daily with a weak solution of zinc chlorid\r\n(2-1/2 per cent solution) has been found to assist in checking the\r\ninflammation and to cleanse and heal the parts by its germicidal action.\r\nWhen the udder is hard, swollen, and painful, support it by a bandage and\r\nfoment frequently with hot water. If calves are allowed to suckle the cows\r\nthe pustules become confluent, and the ulcerations may extend up into the\r\nteat, causing garget and ruining the whole quarter of the udder.\r\n\r\nAs young cows are most susceptible to variola, the milker must exercise\r\nconstant patience with these affected animals so long as their teats or\r\nudders are sore and tender, else the patient may contract vicious habits\r\nwhile resisting painful handling. The flow of milk is usually lessened as\r\nsoon as the fever becomes established, but is again normal with the return\r\nof perfect health.\r\n\r\nThe practice of thorough cleanliness in handling or milking affected cattle\r\nmay, in many instances, prevent the dissemination of the trouble among the\r\nhealthy portion of the herd, but even the greatest care may prove\r\ninsufficient to check the spread until it has attacked each animal of the\r\nherd in turn.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTINOMYCOSIS (LUMPY JAW)\r\n\r\n[Pls. XXXIX-XLI.]\r\n\r\nActinomycosis, also known as lumpy jaw, big jaw, wooden tongue, etc., is a\r\nchronic infectious disease characterized by the formation of peculiar\r\ntumors in various regions of the body, more particularly the head, and is\r\ndue to the specific action of a certain fungus-like germ (actinomyces).\r\nThis fungus is an organism which occurs in the tissues in the form of\r\nrosettes, and it has therefore been termed the \"ray fungus.\" The disease is\r\nnot directly transmitted from one animal to another, but it seems apparent\r\nthat the fungus is conveyed into the tissues by various feedstuffs through\r\nslight wounds of the mucous membrane of the mouth, decayed teeth, or during\r\nthe shedding of milk teeth. The ray fungus is found in nature vegetated on\r\ngrasses, on the awns of barley, the spears of oats, and on other grains.\r\nQuantities of the fungi have been found between the vegetable fibers of\r\nbarley which had penetrated the gums of cattle and on the awns of grain\r\nembedded in the tongues of cows.\r\n\r\nAlthough actinomycotic tumors on cattle had been the object of study for\r\nmany years, it was not until 1877 that the constant presence of actinomyces\r\nwas pointed out by Bollinger, of Munich, and since that time considered the\r\ncause. This fungus was observed in these tumors as early as 1860 by\r\nRivolta, and by others subsequently, without having been suspected as\r\ncausing them.\r\n\r\nSince Bollinger's publication much work has been done, many observations\r\nmade, and many hitherto obscure disease processes brought into relation\r\nwith this fungus. Furthermore, a similar disease in man was first\r\ndefinitely shown to be associated with the same fungus in 1878 by Israel,\r\nand in the following year Ponfick pointed out that the disease described by\r\nBollinger in animals and that found by Israel in man were due to the same\r\ncause; that is, that the fungi described by these observers were one and\r\nthe same.\r\n\r\nThe tumors and abscesses wherever they may be are all found to be the same\r\nin origin by the presence of the actinomyces fungus. When they are incised,\r\na very close scrutiny with the naked eye, or, at most, a hand lens, will\r\nreveal the presence of minute grains which vary from a pale-yellow to a\r\nsulphur-yellow color. They may be very abundant or so few as to be\r\noverlooked. They are embedded in the soft tissue composing the tumor or in\r\nthe pus of the abscess. With a needle they are easily lifted out from the\r\ntissue, and then they appear as roundish masses about one-half millimeter\r\n(1/50 inch) in diameter. To anyone familiar with the use of a microscope\r\nthe recognition of these grains or particles without any previous\r\npreparation is a comparatively easy task.\r\n\r\nWhen examined in the fresh condition under a microscope magnifying up to\r\n250 diameters the general structure is made out without much difficulty.\r\nThese grains consist of collections of minute, roundish masses. Their outer\r\nsurface is made up of club-shaped bodies all radiating from the center of\r\nthe mass (see Pl. XXXIX, fig. 2), somewhat like a rosette. If the fungus is\r\ncrushed, the interior is found made up of bundles of very fine filaments,\r\nwhich are probably continuous into the club-shaped bodies. The addition of\r\na dilute solution of caustic soda or potash greatly aids the examination,\r\nas it removes the layer of cells adhering to the fungus, which obscures the\r\nstructure. Now and then these grains are found to be in a calcified\r\ncondition. The exterior is incrusted in lime salts, which are dissolved by\r\nadding some weak dilute acid, like acetic acid. Only by this procedure can\r\nthe fungus be definitely recognized when in a mummified condition.\r\n\r\nThese are the bodies whose presence causes sufficient irritation in the\r\ntissues into which they find their way to set up inflammatory growths.\r\nThese growths increase as the fungus continues to multiply until they reach\r\nenormous dimensions, if the affected animal is permitted to live long\r\nenough. The true nature of this parasite is not yet definitely settled,\r\nalthough many excellent observers have occupied themselves with it.\r\nAccording to earlier observers, it is a true fungus. Later ones are\r\ninclined to place it among the higher bacteria. Present knowledge\r\nconcerning the actinomyces growth indicates that it should be classified\r\nwith the higher bacteria or trichomycetes.\r\n\r\nWhatever the situation of the disease caused by actinomyces may be, its\r\nnature is fundamentally the same and peculiar to the fungus. The\r\npathological details which make this statement clear can not be entered\r\nupon in this place, nor would they be of any practical value to the farmer.\r\nWe will simply dwell upon a few obvious characters.\r\n\r\nThe consistency of the tumor varies in different situations according to\r\nthe quantity of fibrous or connective tissue present. When very little of\r\nthis is present the tumor is of a very soft consistency. As the quantity of\r\nconnective tissue is increased the tumor is firmer and of a more\r\nhoneycombed appearance. The individual actinomyces colonies are lodged in\r\nthe spaces or interstices formed by the meshwork of the connective tissue.\r\nThere they are surrounded by a mantle of cellular elements which fill up\r\nthe spaces. By scraping the cut surface of such a tumor these cell masses\r\ninclosing the fungi come away, and the latter may be seen as pale-yellow or\r\nsulphur-yellow specks, as described above.\r\n\r\n_Location of the disease._--In cattle the disease process may be located\r\nboth externally, where it is readily detected, and in internal organs. Its\r\npreferred seat is on the bones of the lower and upper jaws, in the parotid\r\nsalivary gland in the angle of the jaw, and in the region of the throat. It\r\nmay also appear under the skin in different parts of the body. Internally\r\nit may attack the tongue and appear in the form of a tumor in the mouth,\r\npharynx, or larynx. It may cause extensive disease of the lungs, more\r\nrarely of the digestive tract.\r\n\r\nIt appears, furthermore, that in certain districts or countries the disease\r\nseems by preference to attack certain parts. Thus in England actinomycosis\r\nof the tongue is most prevalent. In Denmark the soft parts of the head are\r\nmost prone to disease, while in Russia the lips are the usual seat. In\r\ncertain parts of Germany actinomycotic tumors are most frequently\r\nencountered in the throat region and in the jawbones.\r\n\r\nA description of actinomycosis of the jaw (lumpy jaw) and of the tongue has\r\nalready been given in a previous chapter, and hence they will be dealt with\r\nhere only very briefly. When the disease attacks the soft parts of the head\r\na rather firm swelling appears, in which are formed one or more smaller\r\nprojecting tumors, varying from the size of a nut to that of an egg. These\r\npush their way outward and finally break through the skin as small,\r\nreddish, funguslike bodies covered with thin sloughs. Or the original\r\nswelling, in place of enlarging in the manner described, may become\r\ntransformed into an abscess which finally bursts to discharge creamy pus.\r\nThe abscess cavity, however, does not disappear, but is soon filled with\r\nfungus-like growths, which force their way outward through the opening.\r\n\r\nWhen the tumors are situated within the cavity of the pharynx they have\r\nbroken through from some gland, perhaps beneath the mucous membrane, where\r\nthe disease first appeared, and hang or project into the cavity of the\r\npharynx, either as pendulous masses with slender stems or as tumors with\r\nbroad bases. Their position may be such as to interfere with swallowing and\r\nwith breathing. In either case serious symptoms will soon appear.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of the bones of the jaws by actinomycosis must be regarded as\r\none of the most serious forms of the disease. (Pls. XXXIX, XL.) It may\r\nstart in the marrow of the bone and by a slow extension gradually undermine\r\nthe entire thickness of the bone itself. The growth may continue outward,\r\nand after working its way through muscle and skin finally break through and\r\nappear externally as stinking fungoid growths. The growth may at the same\r\ntime work its way inward and appear in the mouth. The disease may also\r\nbegin in the periosteum, or covering of the bone, and destroy the bone from\r\nwithout inward.\r\n\r\nActinomycosis of the lungs is occasionally observed, and it is not\r\nimprobable that at times it has been mistaken for tuberculosis. The\r\nactinomyces grains are, however, easily observed if the diseased tissue is\r\ncarefully examined. The changes in the lungs as they appear to the naked\r\neye vary considerably from case to case. Thus in one animal the lungs were\r\naffected as in ordinary bronchopneumonia as to the location, extent, and\r\nappearance of the disease process. The affected lobes had a dark-red flesh\r\nappearance, with yellowish areas sprinkled in here and there. (See Pl. XLI,\r\nfigs. 1, 2.) These latter areas were the seat of multiplication of the\r\nactinomyces fungus. In another case, of which only a small portion of the\r\nlungs was sent to the laboratory, they were completely transformed into a\r\nuniformly grayish mass, very soft and pulpy to the touch, and appearing\r\nlike very soft and moist dough. (Pl. XLI, fig. 3.) The actinomyces grains\r\nwere exceedingly abundant in this tissue, and appeared when the tissue was\r\nincised as minute sulphur-yellow grains, densely sprinkled through the\r\ntissue, which readily came away and adhered to the knife blade. In still\r\nanother case a portion of the lung tissue was converted into large, soft\r\nmasses from 1 to 3 inches in diameter, each partly inclosed in very dense\r\nconnective tissue. These soft, grayish-yellow masses likewise resembled\r\nmoist dough in their consistency, and the actinomyces grains, though\r\nneither very distinct nor at all abundant, were easily fished out and\r\nidentified as such. A portion of this growth, which was as large as a\r\nchild's head, was converted into an abscess filled with creamy semiliquid\r\npus.\r\n\r\nThis case differed from the preceding in that all appearance of lung tissue\r\nhad disappeared from the diseased mass. Only on the exterior the lung\r\ntissue could be recognized, although even there it had been largely\r\nconverted into very dense, whitish connective tissue inclosing the fungoid\r\ngrowth. In the other case the external form of the lung and the shape and\r\noutline of the lobules were preserved, but the lung tissue itself was not\r\nrecognizable as such. In the case first mentioned the changes were still\r\nless marked, and actinomycosis would not have been suspected by a simple\r\ninspection. These few illustrations suffice to show that actinomycosis of\r\nthe lungs may appear under quite different forms, and that the nature of\r\nthe disease can be accurately determined only by finding the fungus itself.\r\nRarely actinomycosis attacks the body externally in places other than the\r\nhead and neck. Crookshank describes the case of a bull in which the flank\r\nwas attacked and subsequently the scrotum became diseased. A large portion\r\nof the skin of the flank was destroyed and covered with a leathery crust.\r\nWhen this was pulled away the pus beneath it showed the actinomyces grains\r\nto the naked eye.\r\n\r\nActinomycosis may also involve the udder, the spermatic cord of castrated\r\nanimals, the vagina, and, when it becomes generalized, the brain, liver,\r\nspleen, and muscular tissue.\r\n\r\nActinomycosis may in some cases be confounded with tuberculosis. The\r\ndiagnosis does not offer any difficulties, since the presence of the\r\nactinomyces fungus at once removes any existing doubts. As has already been\r\nintimated, these grains, simulating sulphur balls, are visible to the naked\r\neye, and their nature is readily determined with the aid of a microscope.\r\n\r\nThe course of the disease is quite slow. As the tumors grow they may\r\ninterfere with the natural functions of the body. According to their\r\nsituation, mastication, rumination, or breathing may be interfered with,\r\nand in this way the animal may become emaciated. Actinomycosis of the\r\njawbones leads to destruction of the teeth and impedes the movements\r\nnecessary to chewing the feed. Similarly, when the disease attacks the soft\r\nparts of the head obstructions may arise in the mouth by an inward growth\r\nof the tumor. If tumors exist in the pharynx they may partially obstruct\r\nthe movements necessary to breathing, or close the air passages and cause\r\npartial suffocation. Actinomycosis of the tongue, in interfering with the\r\nmany and varied movements of this important organ, is also a serious\r\nmatter. There is no reason to suppose that the localized disease interferes\r\nwith the general health in any other way than indirectly until internal\r\norgans, such as the lungs, become involved.\r\n\r\nA very small proportion of the cases may recover spontaneously, the tumors\r\nbeing encysted or undergoing calcification. In most cases the disease\r\nyields readily to proper treatment, and about 75 per cent of the affected\r\nanimals may be cured.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The question as to how and where animals take this disease\r\nis one concerning which we are still in the stage of conjecture, because so\r\nfar we possess very little information concerning the life history of the\r\nactinomyces itself. The quite unanimous view of all observers is that\r\nanimals become infected from the feed. The fungus is lodged upon the plants\r\nand in some way enters the tissues of the head, the lungs, and the\r\ndigestive tract, where it sets up its peculiar activity. It is likewise\r\ngenerally believed that the fungus is, as it were, inoculated into the\r\naffected part. This inoculation is performed by the sharp and pointed parts\r\nof plants which penetrate the mucous membrane and carry the fungus with\r\nthem. The disease is therefore inoculable rather than contagious. The mere\r\npresence of the diseased animal will not give rise to disease in healthy\r\nanimals unless the actinomyces grains pass directly from the diseased into\r\nsome wound or abrasion of the healthy or else drop upon the feed which is\r\nconsumed by the healthy. Not only are these views deducible from clinical\r\nobservation, but they have been proved by the positive inoculation of\r\ncalves and smaller animals with actinomyces. The danger therefore of the\r\npresence of actinomyces for healthy animals is a limited one. Nevertheless\r\nan animal affected with this disease should not be allowed to go at large\r\nor run with other animals. If the fungus is being scattered by discharging\r\ngrowths we certainly can not state at this stage of our knowledge that\r\nother animals may not be infected by such distribution, and we must assume,\r\nuntil more positive information is at hand, that this actually occurs.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the opinion of the majority of authorities that when\r\nactinomycosis appears among a large number of animals they all contract it\r\nin the same way from the feed. Much speculation has therefore arisen\r\nwhether any particular plant or group of plants is the source of the\r\ninfection and whether any special condition of the soil favors it. Very\r\nlittle positive information is at hand on these questions. It would be very\r\ndesirable for those who live in localities where this disease is prevalent\r\nto make statistical and other observations on the occurrence of the disease\r\nwith reference to the season of the year, the kind of feed, the nature of\r\nthe soil (whether swampy or dry, recently reclaimed, or cultivated for a\r\nlong time) upon which the animals are pastured or upon which the feed is\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nIt is highly probable that such investigations will lead to an\r\nunderstanding of the source of the fungus and the means for checking the\r\nspread of the disease itself. Veterinarian Jensen, of Denmark, made some\r\nobservations upon an extensive outbreak of actinomycosis a number of years\r\nago which led him to infer that the animals were inoculated by eating\r\nbarley straw harvested from pieces of ground just reclaimed from the sea.\r\nWhile the animals remained unaffected so long as they pastured on this\r\nground or ate the hay obtained from it, they became diseased after eating\r\nthe straw of cereals from the same territory. Others have found that cattle\r\ngrazing upon low pastures along the banks of streams and subject to\r\ninundations are more prone to the disease. It has also been observed that\r\nfeed gathered from such grounds, even after prolonged drying, may give rise\r\nto the disease. Actinomycosis is not infrequent in cattle in the Southwest\r\nand is generally supposed to be the result of eating the prickly fruit of\r\nthe cactus plant, causing wounds of the mucous membrane and subsequent\r\ninfection with the parasite. Much additional information of a similar kind\r\nmust be forthcoming before the source and manner of infection in this\r\ndisease and its dependence upon external conditions will be known. It is\r\nnot at all improbable that they may vary considerably from place to place.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Until recently this has been almost entirely surgical. When\r\nthe tumors are external and attached to soft parts only, an early removal\r\nmay lead to recovery. This, of course, can be undertaken only by a trained\r\nveterinarian, especially as the various parts of the head and neck contain\r\nimportant vessels, nerves, and ducts which should be injured as little as\r\npossible in any operation. Unless the tumor is completely removed it will\r\nreappear. Disease of the jawbones is at best a very serious matter and\r\ntreatment is liable to be of no avail.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1892, an important contribution to our knowledge of this subject\r\nwas made by Nocard, of the Alfort Veterinary School, in a communication to\r\nthe French Central Society of Veterinary Medicine. He showed clearly that\r\nthe actinomycosis of the tongue, a disease which appears to be quite common\r\nin Germany, and is there known as \"wooden tongue,\" could be quickly and\r\npermanently cured by the administration of iodid of potassium. Nocard calls\r\nattention to the success of Thomassen, of Utrecht, who recommended this\r\ntreatment so long ago as 1885, and who has since treated more than 80\r\ncases, all of which have been cured. A French veterinarian, Godbille, has\r\nused the same remedy in a number of cases of actinomycosis in the tongue,\r\nall of which have been cured. Nocard also gives details of a case which was\r\ncured by himself.\r\n\r\nAll the cases referred to were of actinomycosis of the tongue, and no one\r\nappears to have attempted the cure of actinomycosis of the jaw until it was\r\nundertaken by Nˆrgaard, of the Bureau of Animal Industry. In April, 1892,\r\nhe selected a young steer in fair condition which had a tumor on the jaw\r\nmeasuring 15-1/2 inches in circumference and from which a discharge had\r\nalready been established. This animal was treated with iodid of potassium,\r\nand the result was a complete cure.\r\n\r\nThe iodid of potassium is given in doses of 1-1/2 and 2-1/2 drams once a\r\nday, dissolved in water, and administered as a drench. The dose should vary\r\nsomewhat with the size of the animal and with the effects that are\r\nproduced. If the dose is sufficiently large signs of iodism appear in the\r\ncourse of a week or 10 days. The skin becomes scurfy, there is weeping from\r\nthe eyes, catarrh of the nose, and loss of appetite. When these symptoms\r\nappear the medicine may be suspended for a few days and afterward resumed\r\nin the same dose. The cure requires from three to six weeks' treatment.\r\nSome animals, generally the ones which show no signs of iodism, do not\r\nimprove under treatment with iodid of potassium.\r\n\r\nIf there is no sign of improvement after the animals have been treated four\r\nor five weeks, and the medicine has been given in as large doses as appear\r\ndesirable, it is an indication that the particular animal is not\r\nsusceptible to the curative effects of the drug, and the treatment may\r\ntherefore be abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, advisable to administer iodid of potassium to milch\r\ncows, as it will considerably reduce the milk secretion or stop it\r\naltogether. Furthermore, a great part of the drug is excreted through the\r\nmilk, making the milk unfit for use. It should not be given to animals in\r\nadvanced pregnancy, as there is danger of producing abortion.\r\n\r\nThe best results are obtained by pushing the drug until its effect is seen.\r\nThe many tests to which this treatment has been subjected have proved, with\r\nfew exceptions, its specific curative value. In addition to this the tumor\r\nshould be painted externally with either the tincture of iodin or Lugol's\r\nsolution, or the drug should be injected subcutaneously into the tumor.\r\n\r\nGodbille has given as much as 4 drams of potassium iodid in one day to a\r\nsteer, decreasing the dose one-fourth dram each day until the dose was\r\n1-1/4 drams, which was maintained until the twelfth day of treatment, when\r\nthe animal appeared to be entirely cured.\r\n\r\nNocard gave the first day 1-1/2 drams in one dose to a cow; the second and\r\nsucceeding days a dose of 1 dram in the morning and evening, in each case\r\nbefore feeding. This treatment was continued for 10 days, when the animal\r\nwas cured.\r\n\r\n_Actinomycosis and the public health._--The interest which is shown\r\nconcerning this cattle disease is largely due to the fact that the same\r\ndisease attacks human beings. Its slow progress, its tendency to remain\r\nrestricted to certain localities, and the absence of any directly\r\ncontagious properties have thus far not aroused any anxiety in other\r\ncountries as to its influence on the cattle industry, not even to the point\r\nof placing it among the infectious diseases of which statistics are\r\nannually published. Its possible bearing on public health has, however,\r\ngiven the disease a place in the public mind which it hardly deserves.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the actinomyces fungus found in human\r\ndisease is considered by authorities the same as that occurring in bovine\r\naffections. It is therefore of interest to conclude this article with a\r\nbrief discussion of the disease in man and its relation to actinomycosis in\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nIn man the location of the disease process corresponds fairly well to that\r\nin cattle. The majority of cases which have been reported in different\r\nparts of the world--and they are now rather numerous--indicate disease of\r\nthe face. The skin, tongue, or the jawbones may become affected, and by a\r\nvery slow process it may extend downward upon the neck and even into the\r\ncavity of the chest. In many cases the teeth have been found in a state of\r\nmore or less advanced decay and ulceration. In a few cases disease of the\r\nlungs was observed without coexisting disease of the bones or soft parts of\r\nthe head. In such cases the fungus must have been inhaled. The disease of\r\nthe lungs after a time extends upon the chest wall, where it may corrode\r\nthe ribs and work its way through the muscles and the skin. An abscess is\r\nthus formed discharging pus containing actinomyces grains. Disease of the\r\ndigestive organs caused by this fungus has also been observed in a few\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nGranting the identity of the disease in man and cattle, the question has\r\nbeen raised whether cattle are responsible for its occurrence in man. Any\r\ntransmission of the infectious agent may be conceived of as taking place\r\nduring the life of the animal and from the meat after slaughter. That human\r\nbeings have contracted actinomycosis by coming in contact with diseased\r\ncattle is not shown by the cases that have been reported, for the\r\noccupations of most of the patients did not bring them into any relation\r\nwhatever with cattle. While the possibility of such direct transmission is\r\nnot denied, nevertheless it must be considered as extremely remote.\r\nPractically the same position is maintained at present by most authorities\r\nas regards the transmission of the disease to man by eating meat. Israel,\r\nwho has studied this question carefully, found the disease in Jews who\r\nnever ate pork,[5] and who likewise were protected from bovine\r\nactinomycosis by the rigorous meat inspection practiced by that race.\r\nFurthermore, it must be borne in mind that actinomycosis is a local\r\ndisease, causing great destruction of tissue where the fungus multiplies,\r\nbut which very rarely becomes generally disseminated over the body from the\r\noriginal disease focus. The fungus is found only in places where the\r\ndisease process is manifest to the eye or becomes so in a very short time\r\nafter the lodgment of the fungus. Only the greatest negligence would allow\r\nthe actually diseased parts to be sold and consumed. Finally, this\r\nparasite, like all others, would be destroyed in the process of cooking.\r\nMost authorities thus do not believe that actinomycosis in man is directly\r\ntraceable to the disease in animals, but are of the opinion that both man\r\nand animals are infected from a third source, which has already been\r\ndiscussed above. How far these views may be modified by further and more\r\ntelling investigations of the parasite fungus itself no one can predict.\r\nThere are still wide gaps in our knowledge, and the presentation above\r\nsimply summarizes the prevailing views, from which there are dissenters, of\r\ncourse. An attempt to give the views of both sides on this question would\r\nnecessitate the summarizing and impartial discussion of all the experiments\r\nthus far made--a task entirely beyond the scope of the present work.\r\n\r\nWhether an animal affected with actinomycosis should be used for human food\r\nafter all diseased organs and tissues have been thoroughly removed is a\r\nquestion the answer to which depends on a variety of circumstances. Among\r\nthese may be mentioned the thoroughness of the meat inspection itself, the\r\nextent of the disease, and the general condition of the animal affected.\r\n\r\nThe Federal meat-inspection regulations require that carcasses of animals\r\nshowing generalized actinomycosis shall be condemned. If carcasses are in a\r\nwell-nourished condition, showing uncomplicated localized lesions of\r\nactinomycosis, they may be passed after the infected organs or parts have\r\nbeen removed and condemned. When the disease of the jaw is slight, strictly\r\nlocalized, and without pus formation, fistulous tracts, or lymph-gland\r\ninvolvement, the tongue, if free from disease, may be passed. The heads\r\naffected with actinomycosis (lumpy jaw), including the tongue, shall be\r\ncondemned, except that when the lesions in the jaw are strictly localized\r\nand slight in extent, the tongue may be passed, if free from disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHRAX.\r\n\r\nAnthrax or charbon may be defined as an infectious disease which is caused\r\nby specific bacteria, known as anthrax bacilli, and which is more or less\r\nrestricted by conditions of soil and moisture to definite geographical\r\nlocalities. While it is chiefly limited to cattle and sheep, it may be\r\ntransmitted to goats, horses, cats, and certain kinds of game. Smaller\r\nanimals, such as mice, rabbits, and guinea pigs, speedily succumb to\r\ninoculation. Dogs and hogs are slightly susceptible, while fowls are\r\npractically immune. The variety of domesticated animals which it may attack\r\nrenders it one of the most dreaded scourges of animal life. It may even\r\nattack man. Of this more will be stated further on.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nACTINOMYCOSIS (LUMPY JAW).\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXIX. Actinomycosis.

(See Pl. XXVIII, fig. 7.) In form it is cylindrical or\r\nrodlike, measuring 1/5000 to 1/2500 inch in length and 1/25000 inch in\r\ndiameter. Like all bacteria, these rodlike bodies have the power of\r\nindefinite multiplication, and in the bodies of infected animals they\r\nproduce death by rapidly increasing in numbers and producing substances\r\nwhich poison the body. In the blood they multiply in number by becoming\r\nelongated and then dividing into two, each new organism continuing the same\r\nprocess indefinitely. Outside the body, however, they multiply in a\r\ndifferent way when under conditions unfavorable to growth. Oval bodies,\r\nwhich are called spores, appear within the rods, and remain alive and\r\ncapable of germination after years of drying. They also resist heat to a\r\nremarkable degree, so that boiling water is necessary to destroy them. The\r\nbacilli themselves, on the other hand, show only very little resistance to\r\nheat and drying. It has long been known that the anthrax virus thrives best\r\nunder certain conditions of the soil and on territories subject to floods\r\nand inundations. The particular kinds of soil upon which the disease is\r\nobserved are black, loose, warm, humous soils; also those containing lime,\r\nmarl, and clay, finally peaty, swampy soils resting upon strata which hold\r\nthe water, or, in other words, are impervious. Hence fields containing\r\nstagnant pools may be the source of infection. The infection may be limited\r\nto certain farms, or even to restricted areas on such farms. Even in the\r\nAlps, more than 3,000 feet above sea level, where such conditions prevail\r\nin secluded valleys, anthrax persists among herds.\r\n\r\nAside from these limitations to specific conditions of the soil, anthrax is\r\na disease of world-wide distribution. It exists in most countries of\r\nEurope, in Asia, Africa, Australia, and in our own country in the lower\r\nMississippi Valley, the Gulf States, and in some of the Eastern and Western\r\nStates. It seems to be gradually spreading in this country and every year\r\noccurs in new districts.\r\n\r\nMeteorological conditions also have an important share in determining the\r\nseverity of the disease. On those tracts subject to inundations in spring a\r\nvery hot, dry summer is liable to cause a severe outbreak. The relation\r\nwhich the bacillus bears to these conditions is not positively known. It\r\nmay be that during and immediately after inundations or in stagnant water\r\nthe bacilli find nourishment enough in the water here and there to multiply\r\nand produce an abundant crop of spores, which are subsequently carried, in\r\na dry condition, by the winds during the period of drought and disseminated\r\nover the vegetation. Animals feeding upon this vegetation may contract the\r\ndisease if the spores germinate in the body.\r\n\r\nAnother source of the virus, and one regarded by many authorities as\r\nperhaps the most important, is the body of an animal which has died of\r\nanthrax. It will be remembered that in such bodies the anthrax bacilli are\r\npresent in great numbers, and wherever blood or other body fluids are\r\nexposed to the air on the surface of the carcass there the formation of\r\nspores will go on with great rapidity in the warm season of the year. It\r\nwill thus be readily understood how this disease may become stationary in a\r\ngiven locality and appear year after year and even grow in severity if the\r\ncarcasses of animals which have succumbed to it are not properly disposed\r\nof. These carcasses should be buried deeply, so that spore formation may be\r\nprevented and no animal have access to them. By exercising this precaution\r\nthe disease will not be disseminated by flies and other insect pests.\r\n\r\nWe have thus two agents at work in maintaining the disease in any\r\nlocality--the soil and meteorological conditions, and the carcasses of\r\nanimals that have died of the disease. Besides these dangers, which are of\r\nimmediate consequence to cattle on pastures, the virus may be carried from\r\nplace to place in hides, hair, wool, hoofs, and horns, and it may be stored\r\nin the hay or other fodder from the infected fields and cause an outbreak\r\namong stabled animals feeding upon it in winter. In this manner the\r\naffection has been introduced into far-distant localities.\r\n\r\n_How cattle are infected._--We have seen above that the spores of the\r\nanthrax bacilli, which in their functions correspond to the seeds of higher\r\nplants and which are the elements that longest resist the unfavorable\r\nconditions in the soil, air, and water, are the chief agents of infection.\r\nThey may be taken into the body with the feed and produce disease which\r\nbegins in the intestinal tract, or they may come in contact with scratches,\r\nbites, or other wounds of the skin, mouth, and tongue, and produce in these\r\nsituations swellings or carbuncles. From such swellings the bacilli\r\npenetrate into the blood and produce a general disease.\r\n\r\nIt has likewise been asserted that the disease may be transmitted by\r\nvarious kinds of insects which carry the bacilli from the sick and\r\ninoculate the healthy as they pierce the skin. When infection of the blood\r\ntakes place from the intestines the carbuncles may be absent. It has\r\nalready been stated that since anthrax spores live for several years, the\r\ndisease may be contracted in winter from feed gathered on permanently\r\ninfected fields.\r\n\r\nThe disease may appear sporadically, i. e., only one or several animals may\r\nbe infected while the rest of the herd remain well, or it may appear as an\r\nepizootic attacking a large number at about the same time.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The symptoms in cattle vary considerably, according as the\r\ndisease begins in the skin, in the lungs, or in the intestines. They depend\r\nalso on the severity of the attack. Thus we may have what is called anthrax\r\nperacutus or apoplectiform, when the animal dies very suddenly as if from\r\napoplexy. Such cases usually occur in the beginning of an outbreak. The\r\nanimal, without having shown any signs of disease, suddenly drops in the\r\npasture and dies in convulsions, or one apparently well at night is found\r\ndead in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe second type (anthrax acutis), without any external swellings, is the\r\none most commonly observed in cattle. The disease begins with a high fever.\r\nThe temperature may reach 106∞ to 107∞ F. The pulse beats from 80 to 100 a\r\nminute. Feeding and rumination are suspended. Chills and muscular tremors\r\nmay appear and the skin show uneven temperature. The ears and base of the\r\nhorns are cold, the coat staring. The animals are dull and stupid and\r\nmanifest great weakness.\r\n\r\nTo these symptoms others are added in the course of the disease. The\r\ndullness may give way to great uneasiness, champing of the jaws, spasms of\r\nthe limbs, kicking and pawing the ground. The breathing may become labored.\r\nThe nostrils then dilate, the mouth is open, the head raised, and all\r\nmuscles of the chest are strained during breathing, while the visible\r\nmucous membranes (nose, mouth, rectum, and vagina) become bluish. If the\r\ndisease has started in the bowels, there is much pain, as shown by the\r\nmoaning of the animal; the discharges, at first firm, become softer and\r\ncovered with serum, mucus, and blood.\r\n\r\nAs the disease approaches the fatal termination the weakness of the animal\r\nincreases. It leans against supports or lies down. Blood vessels may\r\nrupture and give rise to spots of blood on the various mucous membranes and\r\nbloody discharges from nose, mouth, rectum, and vagina. The urine not\r\ninfrequently contains blood (red water), and death ensues within one or two\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nA third type of the disease (anthrax subacutus), which is rarely observed,\r\nincludes those cases in which the disease is more prolonged. It may last\r\nfrom three to seven days and terminate fatally or end in recovery. In this\r\ntype, the symptoms are practically as described in the acute form, only\r\nless marked.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these types of intestinal anthrax, swellings may appear\r\nin different parts of the body under the skin, or the disease may start\r\nfrom such a swelling, caused by the inoculation of anthrax spores in one of\r\nthe several different ways already described. If the disease begins in the\r\nskin, it agrees in general with the subacute form in prolonged duration,\r\nand it may occasionally terminate in recovery if the swellings are\r\nthoroughly incised and treated.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--These swellings appear as edemas and carbuncles. The former are\r\ndoughy tumors of a more or less flattish form passing gradually into the\r\nsurrounding healthy tissue. As a rule, they are situated beneath the skin\r\nin the fatty layer, and the skin itself is at first of healthy appearance,\r\nso that they are often overlooked, especially when covered with a good coat\r\nof hair. When they are cut open they are found to consist of a peculiar,\r\njellylike mass of a yellowish color and more or less stained with blood.\r\nThe carbuncles are firm, hot, tender swellings, which later become cool and\r\npainless and undergo mortification. The edemas and carbuncles may also\r\nappear in the mouth, pharynx, larynx, in the tongue, and in the rectum.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of cattle which have died of anthrax soon lose their rigidity\r\nand become bloated, because decomposition sets in very rapidly. From the\r\nmouth, nose, and anus bloodstained fluid flows in small quantities. When\r\nsuch carcasses are opened and examined it is found that nearly all organs\r\nare sprinkled with spots of blood or extravasations of various sizes. The\r\nspleen is enlarged from two to five times, the pulp blackish and soft and\r\noccasionally disintegrated. The blood is of tarry consistency, not firmly\r\ncoagulated, and blackish in color. In the abdomen, the thoracic cavity, and\r\nin the pericardium, or bag surrounding the heart, more or less\r\nblood-stained fluid is present. In addition to these characteristic signs,\r\nthe carbuncles and swellings under the skin, already described, will aid in\r\ndetermining the true nature of the disease. The most reliable method of\r\ndiagnosis is the examination of the blood and tissues for anthrax bacilli,\r\nwhich requires a trained bacteriologist. The cases of fatal anthrax number\r\nfrom 70 to 90 per cent, and are usually more numerous at the first outbreak\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--The diagnosis from blackleg may be made by\r\nnoting the subcutaneous swellings which appear upon the patient. Those of\r\nblackleg are found to crackle under pressure with the finger, owing to the\r\npresence of gas within the tissues, while the tumors of anthrax, being\r\ncaused by the pressure of serum, are entirely free from this quality and\r\nhave a somewhat doughy consistence. The tumors of blackleg are usually on\r\nthe shoulder or thigh and are not found so frequently about the neck and\r\nside of the body as are the swellings of anthrax. The blood of animals dead\r\nof blackleg is normal, and the spleen does not appear swollen or darkened,\r\nas in those affected with anthrax. The chief differences between anthrax\r\nand Texas fever are that the course of the former is more acute and the\r\nblood of the animal is dark and of a tarlike consistence, while in the\r\nlatter it is thinner than normal. The presence of Texas-fever ticks on the\r\ncattle would also lead one to suspect that disease in regions where cattle\r\nare not immune from it.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In cases which originate from external wounds, the swellings\r\nshould be opened freely by long incisions with a sharp knife and washed\r\nseveral times daily with carbolic-acid solution (1 ounce to a quart of\r\nwater). Care should be taken to disinfect thoroughly any fluid discharge\r\nthat may follow the incision. When suppuration has set in the treatment\r\nrecommended in the chapter on wounds should be carried out.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of animals showing symptoms of anthrax, the serum\r\nrecommended under the next heading of \"Prevention\" should be administered\r\nin large doses. Animals showing only a high temperature with no other\r\nsymptoms of the disease should be given from 30 to 50 cubic centimeters of\r\nthe serum, but if the gravity of the disease is pronounced 100 cubic\r\ncentimeters should be administered. In most instances a drop in temperature\r\nmay be observed and a diminishing of the severity of the symptoms. At\r\ntimes, however, a relapse occurs about the second or third day following\r\nthe serum injection, when it becomes necessary to administer another dose\r\nof serum. It has been proved that animals affected with anthrax may recover\r\nafter injections of potent serum.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--In this disease prevention is the most important subject\r\ndemanding consideration. The various means to be suggested may be brought\r\nunder two heads: (1) The surroundings of the animal, and (2) preventive\r\ninoculation.\r\n\r\n(1) Surroundings.--What has already been stated of those conditions of the\r\npastures which are favorable to anthrax, after a little thought, will\r\nsuggest to most minds some of the preventive measures which may be of\r\nservice in reducing losses in anthrax localities. All that conduces to a\r\nbetter state of the soil should be attempted. The State or Nation, by\r\nappropriate engineering, should do its share in preventing frequent\r\ninundations. If pools of stagnant water exist in the pastures, or if any\r\nparticular portions are known by experience to give rise to anthrax, they\r\nshould be fenced off. Efforts should likewise be made toward the proper\r\ndraining of swamp lands frequented by cattle. Sometimes it has been found\r\ndesirable to abandon for a season any infected or dangerous pastures. This\r\nremedy can not be carried out by most farmers, and it is liable to extend\r\nthe infected territory. In some instances withdrawal of cattle from\r\npastures entirely and feeding them in stables is said to have reduced the\r\nlosses.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that carcasses of animals which have died of\r\nanthrax be properly disposed of, as every portion of such animal contains\r\nthe bacilli, ready to form spores when exposed to the air. Perhaps the\r\nsimplest means is to bury the carcasses deep, where they can not be exposed\r\nby dogs or wild animals. It may be necessary to bury them on the pasture,\r\nbut it is better to remove them to places not frequented by susceptible\r\nanimals and to a point where drainage from the graves can not infect any\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nIf they are moved some distance it must be borne in mind that the ground\r\nand all objects which have come in contact with the carcass should be\r\ndisinfected. This is best accomplished with chlorid of lime. For washing\r\nutensils, etc., a 5 per cent solution may be prepared by adding 3 ounces to\r\n2 quarts of water. This should be prepared fresh from the powder, and it is\r\nbut little trouble to have a small tin measure of known capacity to dip out\r\nthe powder, to be added to the water whenever necessary. The carcass and\r\nthe ground should be sprinkled with powdered chlorid, or, if this is not at\r\nhand, an abundance of ordinary, unslaked lime should be used in its place.\r\n\r\nThe removal of carcasses to rendering establishments is always fraught with\r\ndanger, unless those who handle them are thoroughly aware of the danger of\r\nscattering the virus by careless handling in wagons that are not tight. As\r\na rule, the persons in charge of such transfer have no training for this\r\nimportant work, so that deep burial is to be preferred. Burning large\r\ncarcasses is not always feasible; it is, however, the most certain means of\r\ndestroying infectious material of any kind, and should be resorted to\r\nwhenever practicable and economical. All carcasses, whether buried,\r\nrendered, or burned, should be disposed of unopened. When stables have\r\nbecome infected they should be thoroughly cleaned out, and the solution of\r\nchlorid of lime freely applied on floors and woodwork. The feed should be\r\ncarefully protected from contamination with the manure or other discharges\r\nfrom the sick.\r\n\r\n(2) Preventive inoculation.--One of the most important discoveries in\r\nconnection with the disease was made by Louis Pasteur in 1881, and\r\nconsisted in the new principle of producing immunity by the inoculation of\r\nweakened cultures of the bacillus causing the disease. This method has been\r\nquite extensively adopted in France, and to some extent in other European\r\ncountries, and in the United States. The fluid used for inoculation\r\nconsists of bouillon in which modified anthrax bacilli have multiplied and\r\nare present in large numbers. The bacilli have been modified by heat so\r\nthat to a certain degree they have lost their original virulence. Two\r\nvaccines are prepared. The first or weaker, for the first inoculation, is\r\nobtained by subjecting the bacilli to the attenuating effects of heat for a\r\nlonger period of time than in the case of the second, or stronger vaccine,\r\nfor a second inoculation some 12 days later.\r\n\r\nThere are several difficulties inherent in the practical application of\r\nPasteur's vaccine. Among them may be mentioned the variable degree of\r\nattenuation of different tubes of the vaccine and the varying\r\nsusceptibility of the animals to be inoculated. The use of this vaccine is\r\nincreasing, nevertheless, and has reduced the mortality in the affected\r\ndistricts from an average of 10 per cent in the case of sheep, to less than\r\n1 per cent, and from 5 per cent with cattle, to less than one-half of 1 per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt is very important to call attention to the possibility of distributing\r\nanthrax by this method of protective inoculation, as the bacilli themselves\r\nare present in the culture liquid. It is true that they have been modified\r\nand weakened by the process adopted by Pasteur, but it is not impossible\r\nfor such modified virus to regain its original virulence after it has been\r\nscattered broadcast by the inoculation of large herds. It is obviously\r\nunsafe to have such vaccine injected by a layman; instead, it should be\r\nhandled only by a competent veterinarian.\r\n\r\nThere are other disadvantages in this method of vaccination, and they all\r\nmust be given due consideration. The unstable keeping quality of the\r\nPasteur vaccine is a very important factor to be considered. Experience in\r\nthis line has proved that Pasteur vaccine may deteriorate within a very\r\nshort time after its preparation, and in repeated instances it has proved\r\ninert within three months of its preparation. When exposed to warm\r\ntemperature and light, it deteriorates very rapidly; and when it is\r\nconsidered that the products of manufacturers may be stored under\r\nunfavorable conditions in branch houses and on the shelves of rural drug\r\nstores, the loss of potency can be readily explained. These deficiencies\r\nhave been recognized by many investigators, and because of the superior\r\nkeeping qualities particular attention has been directed toward the\r\npreparation of a spore vaccine by Zenkowsky of Russia, Detre of Hungary,\r\nand Nitta of Japan. For the purpose of producing a spore vaccine it is\r\ndesirable to use a peptone-free agar medium, and after inoculation with an\r\nattenuated culture of the anthrax bacillus, it is allowed to grow at a\r\ntemperature of 37∞ C. for 4 to 7 days. By this time an abundance of spores\r\nwill have formed. The growth is then collected in sterile flasks and heated\r\nto a temperature of 60∞ C. for one-half hour to destroy the vegetative\r\nforms of the organism. If it is desired to use for vaccination one million\r\nspores, it is advisable to dilute the vaccine to a quantity of which 1\r\ncubic centimeter would contain this number. Of such a vaccine 1 cubic\r\ncentimeter would constitute the dose for cattle and horses. In all forms of\r\nvaccination against anthrax in sheep the greatest care must be exercised,\r\nas these animals are very susceptible to the disease, and at times vaccines\r\nwhich have no ill effects on cattle will prove fatal to sheep. Therefore\r\nthe dose of the spore vaccine for sheep should not be more than one-fourth\r\nof that given to cattle.\r\n\r\nSclavo, Sobernheim, and others have established that injections of\r\nincreasing quantities of virulent cultures into immune animals produced a\r\nserum which has great protective value against anthrax. Such protective\r\nserum may be produced in the various susceptible animals.\r\n\r\nFor immunization purposes it is advisable to use the simultaneous method;\r\nthat is, both the spore vaccine and the anthrax serum should be injected.\r\nIt is desirable to divide the herd to be treated into groups of ten or\r\ntwelve and inject, first, each animal of the group with the serum,\r\nfollowing this with the injection of the spore vaccine. The serum should be\r\ninjected on one side, either on the neck or back of the shoulder, and the\r\nspore vaccine on the other side, injections being made subcutaneously. In\r\nherds in which the disease has already made its appearance it is necessary\r\nto take the temperatures of all the animals and to subject to the\r\nsimultaneous vaccination only those that show no rise in temperature. All\r\nothers should be given the serum-alone treatment in doses varying in\r\naccordance with the severity of the symptoms manifested by the individual\r\nanimals. If the examination reveals a considerable number of infections, it\r\nis advisable to use the serum alone for all the animals, and in three or\r\nfour weeks to revaccinate by the simultaneous method. The dosage should\r\ndepend on the potency of the serum, serum of a high potency naturally being\r\nmost desirable. Thus serum in 10 cubic centimeter doses for large animals,\r\nand 3 to 5 cubic centimeter doses for smaller ones, has been found to be\r\neffective in producing a temporary immunity.\r\n\r\nAs anthrax is entirely different from blackleg, vaccine for the latter does\r\nnot act as a preventive against the former.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHRAX IN MAN (MALIGNANT PUSTULE, OR CARBUNCLE).\r\n\r\nAnthrax may be transmitted to man in handling the carcasses and hides of\r\nanimals which have succumbed to the disease. The infection usually takes\r\nplace through some abrasion or slight wound of the skin into which the\r\nanthrax spores, or bacilli, find their way. The point of inoculation\r\nappears at first as a dark point or patch, compared by some writers to the\r\nsting of a flea. After a few hours this is changed into a reddened pimple,\r\nwhich bears on its summit, usually around a hair, a yellowish blister, or\r\nvesicle, which later on becomes red or bluish in color. The burning\r\nsensation in this stage is very great. Later this pimple enlarges, its\r\ncenter becomes dry, gangrenous, and is surrounded by an elevated,\r\ndiscolored swelling. The center becomes drier and more leatherlike, and\r\nsinks in as the whole increases in size. The skin around this swelling or\r\ncarbuncle is stained yellow or bluish, and is not infrequently swollen and\r\ndoughy to the touch. The carbuncle itself rarely grows larger than a pea or\r\na small nut, and is but slightly painful.\r\n\r\nAnthrax swellings or edemas, already described as occurring in cattle, may\r\nalso be found in man, and they are at times so extensive as to produce\r\ndistortion in the appearance of the part of the body on which they are\r\nfound. The color of the skin over these swellings varies according to the\r\nsituation and thickness of the skin and the stage of the disease, and may\r\nbe white, red, bluish, or blackish.\r\n\r\nAs sooner or later these carbuncles and swellings may lead to an infection\r\nof the entire body, and thus be fatal, surgical assistance should at once\r\nbe called if there is well-grounded suspicion that any swellings resembling\r\nthose described above have been caused by inoculation with anthrax virus.\r\nInasmuch as physicians differ as to medicinal treatment of such accidents\r\nin man, it would be out of place to make any suggestions in this\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nExtensive data are available, however, on the effectiveness of anthrax\r\nserum for the treatment of the disease in man. It is recommended that from\r\n30 to 40 cubic centimeters of serum be injected in three or four different\r\nplaces. Should no improvement follow in 24 hours additional injections of\r\n20 to 30 cubic centimeters should be administered.\r\n\r\nIn most instances the results are favorable, and this treatment is\r\nacknowledged to be superior to any other mode of treatment known for the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nTo show that the transmission of anthrax to man is not so very uncommon, we\r\ntake the following figures from the 1890 report of the German Government:\r\nThe attention of the authorities was brought to 111 cases, of which 11\r\nterminated fatally. The largest number of inoculations were caused by the\r\nslaughtering, opening, and skinning of animals affected with anthrax;\r\nhence, the butchers suffered most extensively. Of the 111 thus affected, 36\r\nbelonged to this craft. Infected shaving brushes also are very dangerous.\r\n\r\nIn addition to anthrax of the skin (known as malignant pustule), human\r\nbeings are subject, though very rarely, to the disease of the lungs and the\r\ndigestive organs. In the former case the spores are inhaled by workmen in\r\nestablishments in which wool, hides, and rags are worked over, and it is\r\ntherefore known as woolsorter's disease. In the latter case the disease is\r\ncontracted by eating the flesh of diseased animals which has not been\r\nthoroughly cooked. These forms of the disease are more fatal than those in\r\nwhich the disease starts from the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACKLEG.\r\n\r\n[Pl. XLII.]\r\n\r\nBlackleg, black quarter, quarter ill, symptomatic anthrax, charbon\r\nsymptomatique of the French, Rauschbrand of the Germans, is a rapidly\r\nfatal, infectious disease of young cattle, associated with external\r\nswellings which emit a crackling sound when handled. This disease was\r\nformerly regarded identical with anthrax, but investigations by various\r\nscientists in recent times have definitely proved the entire dissimilarity\r\nof the two affections, both from a clinical and a causal standpoint. The\r\ndisease is produced by a specific bacillus, readily distinguishable from\r\nthat causing anthrax. (Pl. XXVIII, fig. 4.) Cattle between 6 months and 2\r\nyears of age are the most susceptible. Sucking calves under 6 months are\r\nrarely attacked, nor are they so susceptible to inoculation as older\r\nanimals. Cattle more than 2 years of age may become affected, but such\r\ncases are infrequent. Sheep and goats may also contract the disease, but\r\nman, horses, hogs, dogs, cats, and fowls appear to be immune.\r\n\r\nLike anthrax, blackleg is more or less restricted to definite localities.\r\nThere are certain pastures upon which the disease regularly appears in the\r\nsummer and fall of the year. As to any peculiarities of the soil nothing is\r\ndefinitely known. Some authors are inclined to regard moist, undrained, and\r\nswampy pastures favorable to this disease, but these theories will hardly\r\nhold, as it is found in all kinds of soil, in all altitudes, at all seasons\r\nof the year, and under various climatic conditions. It occurs in this\r\ncountry from the Atlantic to the Pacific and from Mexico to Canada, but it\r\nis more prevalent in the Western and Southwestern States. In Europe it\r\nexists in France, various parts of Germany, in Belgium, Norway, Denmark,\r\nItaly, and in the Alps of Switzerland. In Africa it occurs in Algeria and\r\nto some extent in Natal and bordering countries. In South America it\r\nprevails quite extensively throughout Argentina. Cattle in Cuba and\r\nAustralia also suffer.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The cause of the disease is a bacillus resembling in some minor\r\nrespects the anthrax bacillus and differing but little from it in size. It\r\nalso possesses the power of forming within itself a spore. In Plate XXVIII,\r\nfigure 4, this is represented as an uncolored spot located in one end of\r\nthe rod, which is enlarged so that the rod itself appears more or less\r\nclub-shaped. What has already been stated concerning the significance of\r\nthe spore of the anthrax bacillus applies equally well to these bodies.\r\nThey resist destructive agents for a considerable time, and may still\r\nproduce disease when inoculated after several years of drying. This fact\r\nmay account for the occasional appearance of blackleg in stables. In order\r\nto meet the requirements for the development of the spores, which takes\r\nplace only in the absence of the atmosphere, it is necessary that the wound\r\nbe very small and deep enough to penetrate the subcutaneous tissue.\r\n\r\nSeveral observers have found this organism in the mud of swamps. By placing\r\na little of the mud under the skin, the disease has been produced.\r\n\r\nSince the disease may be produced by placing under the skin material\r\ncontaining the specific bacilli and spores, it has been assumed that cattle\r\ncontract the disease through wounds, principally of the skin, or very\r\nrarely of the mouth, tongue, and throat. Slight wounds into which the virus\r\nmay find access may be caused by barbed wire, stubbles, thorns, briers,\r\ngrass burs, and sharp or pointed parts of feed. Infection by way of\r\ndigestive tract is also probable.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms and lesions._--The symptoms of blackleg may be either of a\r\ngeneral or of a local nature, though more frequently of the latter. The\r\ngeneral symptoms are very much like those belonging to other acute\r\ninfectious or bacterial diseases. They begin, from one to three days after\r\nthe infection has taken place, with loss of appetite and of rumination,\r\nwith dullness and debility, and a high fever. The temperature may rise to\r\n107∞ F. To these may be added lameness or stiffness of one or more limbs,\r\ndue to the tumor or swelling quite invariably accompanying the disease.\r\nAfter a period of disease lasting from one to three days the affected\r\nanimal almost always succumbs. Death is preceded by increasing weakness,\r\ndifficult breathing, and occasional attacks of violent convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe most important characteristic of this disease is the appearance of a\r\ntumor or swelling under the skin a few hours after the setting in of the\r\nconstitutional symptoms described above. In some cases it may appear first.\r\nThis tumor may be on the thighs (hence \"blackleg,\" \"black quarter\"), the\r\nneck, the shoulder, the breast, the flanks, or the rump; never below the\r\ncarpal (or knee) and the hock joint. It more rarely appears in the throat\r\nand at the base of the tongue. The tumor, at first small and painful,\r\nspreads very rapidly both in depth and extent. When it is stroked or\r\nhandled a peculiar crackling sound is heard under the skin; this is due to\r\na collection of gas formed by the bacilli as they multiply. At this stage\r\nthe skin becomes dry, parchment-like, and cool to the touch in the center\r\nof the tumor. If the swelling is cut into, a frothy, dark-red, rather\r\ndisagreeable-smelling fluid is discharged. The animal manifests little or\r\nno pain during the operation.\r\n\r\nAs it is frequently desirable to know whether the disease is anthrax or\r\nblackleg, a few of the most obvious post-mortem changes may here be cited.\r\nThe characteristic tumor with its crackling sound when stroked has already\r\nbeen described. If after the death of the animal it is more thoroughly\r\nexamined, it will be noted that the tissues under the skin are infiltrated\r\nwith blood and yellowish, jellylike material and gas bubbles. The\r\nmuscular tissue beneath the swelling may be brownish or black, shading into\r\ndark red. (Pl. XLII.) It is soft, easily torn and broken up. The muscle\r\ntissue is distended with numerous smaller or larger gas-filled cavities,\r\noften to such extent as to produce a resemblance to lung tissue. Upon\r\nincision it does not collapse perceptibly, as the gas cavities are not\r\nconnected with one another.\r\n\r\nIn the abdomen and the thorax bloodstained fluid is not infrequently found,\r\ntogether with bloodstaining of the lining membrane of these cavities. Blood\r\nspots (or ecchymoses) are also found on the heart and lungs. The liver is\r\ncongested, but the spleen is always normal in appearance.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--Among the features of this disease which\r\ndistinguish it from anthrax may be mentioned the unchanged spleen and the\r\nready clotting of the blood. It will be remembered that in anthrax the\r\nspleen (milt) is very much enlarged, the blood tarry, coagulating feebly.\r\nThe anthrax carbuncles and swellings differ from the blackleg swellings in\r\nnot containing gas, in being hard and solid, and in causing death less\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to distinguish between the swellings of blackleg and\r\nmalignant edema, as they resemble each other very closely and both are\r\ndistended with gas. Malignant edema, however, generally starts from a wound\r\nof considerable size; it usually follows surgical operations, and seldom\r\nresults from the small abrasions and pricks to which animals are subjected\r\nin pastures. Inoculation experiments on guinea pigs, rabbits, and chickens\r\nwill generally disclose the differences between the three diseases above,\r\nas all these species are killed by the germ of malignant edema, only the\r\nfirst two species by the anthrax bacillus, while the guinea pigs alone will\r\nsuccumb to the blackleg infection. Hemorrhagic septicemia may be\r\ndifferentiated from blackleg by its affecting cattle of all ages, by the\r\nlocation of the swelling usually about the region of the throat, neck, and\r\ndewlap, by the soft, doughy character of the swellings without the presence\r\nof gas bubbles, and finally by the characteristic hemorrhages widely\r\ndistributed throughout the body. Other means of diagnosis, which have\r\nreference to the specific bacilli, to the inoculable character of the virus\r\nupon small animals, and which are of decisive and final importance, can be\r\nutilized only by the trained bacteriologist and veterinarian.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--In this disease remedies have thus far proved unavailing.\r\nSome writers recommend the use of certain drugs, which seem to have been\r\nbeneficial in a few cases, but a thorough trial has shown them to be\r\nvalueless. Others advise that the swelling be opened by deep and long\r\nincisions and a strong disinfectant, such as a 5 per cent solution of\r\ncarbolic acid, applied to the exposed parts; but this procedure can not be\r\ntoo strongly condemned. As nearly all those attacked die, in spite of every\r\nkind of treatment, and in view of the fact that when these tumors are\r\nopened the germs of the disease are scattered over the stables or pastures,\r\nthus becoming a source of danger to other cattle, it is obvious that such\r\nmeasures do more harm than good and should be put aside as dangerous.\r\nBleeding, nerving, roweling, or setoning have likewise some adherents, but\r\nthe evidence indicates that they have neither curative nor preventive value\r\nand therefore should be discarded for the method of vaccination which has\r\nbeen thoroughly tried and proved to be efficacious.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--The various means suggested under \"Anthrax\" to prevent the\r\nspread or recurrence of this disease are equally applicable to blackleg,\r\nand hence do not need to be repeated here in full. They consist in the\r\nremoval of well animals from the infected pasture to a noninfected field,\r\nthe draining of the swampy ground, the burial or burning of the carcasses\r\nto prevent the dissemination of the germs over vast areas through the\r\nagency of dogs, wolves, buzzards, or crows, the disinfection of the stables\r\nand the ground where the animals lay at the time of death, and, if\r\npossible, the destruction of the germs on the infected pastures. One of the\r\nmost effective methods for freeing an infected pasture from blackleg is to\r\nallow the grass to grow high, and when sufficiently dry to burn it off. One\r\nburning off is not sufficient to redeem an infected pasture, but the\r\nprocess should be repeated several years in succession. This method,\r\nhowever, is in many instances impracticable, as few cattle owners can\r\nafford to do it, and the only means left for the protection of the animals\r\nis vaccination.\r\n\r\n_Immunization by vaccination._--Three French veterinarians, Arloing,\r\nCornevin, and Thomas, were the first to discover that cattle may be\r\nprotected against blackleg by inoculation with virulent material obtained\r\nfrom animals which have died of this disease. Later they devised a method\r\nof inoculation with the attenuated or weakened blackleg spores which\r\nproduced immunity from natural or artificial inoculation of virulent\r\nblackleg germs. Their method has undergone various modifications both in\r\nregard to the manufacture of the vaccine and in the mode of its\r\napplication. Kitt, a German scientist, modified the method so that but one\r\ninoculation of the vaccine was required instead of two, as was the case\r\nwith that made by the French investigators. The vaccine formerly prepared\r\nand distributed by the Bureau of Animal Industry combined the principle of\r\nArloing, Cornevin, and Thomas, and the modification of Kitt.\r\n\r\nBy vaccination we understand the injection of a minute amount of\r\nattenuated--that is, artificially weakened--blackleg virus into the system.\r\nThis virus is obtained from animals which have died from blackleg, by\r\nsecuring the affected muscles, cutting them into strips, and drying them in\r\nthe air. When they are perfectly dry they are pulverized and mixed with\r\nwater to form a paste, smeared in a thin layer on flat dishes, placed in an\r\noven, and heated for six hours at a temperature close to that of boiling\r\nwater. The paste is then transformed into a hard crust, which is pulverized\r\nand sifted and distributed in packages containing either 10 or 25 doses.\r\nThis constitutes the vaccine, the strength of which is thoroughly tested on\r\nexperiment animals before it is distributed among the cattle owners. This\r\nvaccine, which is in the form of a brownish, dry powder, is mixed with\r\ndefinite quantities of sterile water, filtered, and by means of a\r\nhypodermic syringe the filtrate injected under the skin in front of the\r\nshoulder of the animal. The inoculation is usually followed by\r\ninsignificant symptoms. In a few cases there is a slight rise of\r\ntemperature, and by close observation a minute swelling may be noted at the\r\npoint of inoculation. The immunity conferred in this way may last for 18\r\nmonths, but animals vaccinated before they are 6 months old and those in\r\nbadly infected districts should be revaccinated before the following\r\nblackleg season.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the vaccine prepared by this bureau in preventing outbreaks\r\nof the disease and in immediately abating outbreaks already in progress was\r\nhighly satisfactory, and it is not to be doubted that thousands of young\r\ncattle were saved to the stock owners during the 25 years in which the\r\nvaccine was distributed.[6] More than 47,000,000 doses were sent out during\r\nthis period, and from reports received it is safe to conclude that more\r\nthan 40,000,000 were actually injected, whereby the percentage of loss from\r\nblackleg has been reduced from 10 per cent, which annually occurred before\r\nusing, to less than one-half of 1 per cent per annum. With these figures\r\nbefore us it is plain that the general introduction of preventive\r\nvaccination must be of material benefit to the cattle raisers in the\r\ninfected districts. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that with\r\nthe continued use of blackleg vaccine in all districts where the disease is\r\nknown to occur, and an earnest effort on the part of the stock owners to\r\nprevent the reinfection of their pastures by following the directions\r\ngiven, blackleg may be kept in check and gradually eradicated.\r\n\r\nImmunization against blackleg is now frequently accomplished by the use of\r\nthe so-called blackleg aggressin and blackleg filtrates.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECROTIC STOMATITIS (CALF DIPHTHERIA).\r\n\r\n[Pl. XLIII.]\r\n\r\nNecrotic stomatitis is an acute, specific, highly contagious inflammation\r\nof the mouth occurring in young cattle, and characterized locally by the\r\nformation of ulcers and caseo-necrotic patches and by constitutional\r\nsymptoms, chiefly toxic.\r\n\r\nThis disease has also been termed calf diphtheria, gangrenous stomatitis,\r\nulcerative stomatitis, malignant stomatitis, tubercular stomatitis, and\r\ndiphtheritic patches of the oral mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n_History._--During the last few years farmers and cattlemen in this\r\ncountry, especially in Colorado, Texas, and South Dakota, have increasingly\r\nnoted the occurrence of enzootics of \"sore mouth\" among the young animals\r\nof their herds. Instead of healing, like the usual forms, of themselves,\r\nthese cases, if untreated, die. Careful study of some of them has resulted\r\nin their identification with cases reported in 1877 by Dammann, from the\r\nshore of the Baltic; in 1878 by Blazekowic, in Slavonia; in 1879 by\r\nVollers, in Holstein; in 1880 by Lenglen, in France; in 1881 by\r\nMacgillivray, in England; and in 1884 by Lˆffler, who isolated and\r\ndescribed the microorganism which produces the disease. Bang obtained this\r\norganism from the diphtheritic lesions of calves in 1890, and Kitt likewise\r\nrecovered the bacillus from similar lesions of the larynx and pharynx of\r\ncalves and pigs in 1893.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XLII. SECTION OF MUSCLE FROM A BLACKLEG SWELLING.\r\n   a. GAS BUBBLES.\r\n   b. CAVITIES DUE TO GAS FORMATION.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XLIII. NECROTIC STOMATITIS (CALF DIPTHERIA).]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Etiology._--The cause of necrotic stomatitis, as demonstrated by Lˆffler\r\nand since confirmed by other investigators, is _Bacillus necrophorus_,\r\noften spoken of as the bacillus of necrosis. This organism varies in form\r\nfrom a coccoid rod to long, wavy filaments, which may reach a length of\r\n100µ; the width varies from 0.75µ to 1µ. Hence it is described as\r\npolymorphic. It does not stain by Gram, but takes the ordinary anilin dyes,\r\noften presenting, especially the longer forms, a beaded appearance. A\r\ncharacteristic of the organism, of great moment when we come to treatment,\r\nis that it grows only in the absence of oxygen, from which fact it is\r\ndescribed as an obligate anÊrobe.\r\n\r\nVery few organisms exhibit a wider range of pathogenesis. According to\r\nclinical observation to the present time, _Bacillus necrophorus_ is\r\npathogenic for cattle, horses, hogs, sheep, reindeer, kangaroos, antelope,\r\nand rabbits. Experimentally it has been proved pathogenic for rabbits and\r\nwhite mice. The dog, cat, guinea pig, pigeon, and chicken appear to be\r\nabsolutely immune. It is not pathogenic for man.\r\n\r\nThe importance of this bacillus is far beyond even its relation to necrotic\r\nstomatitis. Besides this disease it has been demonstrated as the causative\r\nfactor in foot rot, multiple liver abscesses, disseminated liver necrosis,\r\nembolic necrosis of the lungs, necrosis of the heart, in cattle; gangrenous\r\npox of the teats, diphtheria of the uterus and vagina, in cows;\r\ndiphtheritic inflammation of the small intestine of calves. Among horses it\r\nis the agent in the production of necrotic malanders, quittor, and\r\ndiphtheritic inflammation of the large intestine. In hogs it has caused\r\nnecrotic or diphtheritic processes in the mucous membrane of the mouth,\r\nnecrosis of the anterior wall of the nasal septum, and pulmonary and\r\nintestinal necrosis, accompanying hog cholera. Abscesses of the liver,\r\ngangrenous processes of the lips and nose, and gangrenous affections of the\r\nhoof have all been caused in sheep by this organism.\r\n\r\n_Pathology._--The principal lesions in necrotic stomatitis occur in the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and pharynx. The alterations may extend to the\r\nnasal cavities, the larynx, the trachea, the lung, the esophagus, the\r\nintestines, and to the hoof. The oral surfaces affected are, in the order\r\nof frequency, tongue, cheeks, hard palate, gums, lips, and pharynx. In the\r\nmajority of cases the primary infection seems to occur in the tongue. (Pl.\r\nXLIII.)\r\n\r\nInfection takes place by inoculation. Some abrasion or break in the\r\ncontinuity of the mucous membrane of the mouth occurs. Very likely the\r\norigin may be connected with the eruption of the first teeth after birth,\r\nor, in animals somewhat older, the entrance of a sharp-pointed particle of\r\nfeed. Gaining an entrance at this point, the bacilli begin to multiply.\r\nDuring their development they elaborate a toxin, or poisonous substance,\r\nwhich causes the death, or necrosis, of the epithelial, or superficial,\r\nlayer of the mucous membrane and also of the white blood cells which have\r\nsallied forth through the vessel walls to the defense of the tissues\r\nagainst the bacillary attack. This destruction of the surface epithelium\r\nseems to be the essential factor in the production of the caseous patch,\r\noften called the false membrane. From the connective-tissue framework below\r\nis poured forth an inflammatory exudate highly albuminous or rich in\r\nfibrin-forming elements. When this exudate and the necrosed cellular\r\nelements come in contact, the latter furnish a fibrin ferment which\r\ntransforms the exduate into a fibrinous mass. This process is known as\r\ncoagulation necrosis, and the resulting fibroid mass, containing in its\r\nmeshes the necrosed and degenerated epithelium and leucocytes, constitutes\r\nthe diphtheritic or false membrane. Did the process cease at this point it\r\nwould be properly called a diphtheritic inflammation, but it does not. A\r\ncaseating ferment is supplied by the bacilli, and this, acting upon the\r\nfibroid patch, transforms it into a dry, finely granular, yellowish mass of\r\ntissue detritus resembling cheese.\r\n\r\nFrequently this caseous inflammation results in the formation of one or\r\nmore ulcers with thickened, slightly reddened borders, surmounted by\r\nseveral layers of this necrosed tissue. The floor of the ulcer is formed by\r\na grayish-yellow, corroded surface, under which the tissue is transformed\r\ninto a dry, friable, or firm cheesy mass. In the tongue this may progress\r\nto two fingers' thickness into the muscular portion; in the cheek it may\r\nform an external opening, permitting fluids to escape from the mouth; upon\r\nthe palate it frequently reaches and includes the bone in its destructive\r\ncourse; upon the gums it has produced necrosis of the tooth sockets,\r\ncausing loss of the teeth. In the advanced forms, caseous foci may be seen\r\nin the lung and in the liver and necrotic patches observed on the mucous\r\nmembrane of the gastrointestinal tract.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Necrotic stomatitis is both a local and a systemic affection.\r\nPrimarily it is local. The local lesion is the caseo-necrotic patch or\r\nulcer developed as a result of the multiplication of the bacilli at the\r\npoint of inoculation. The general affection is an intoxication, or\r\npoisoning, of the whole system produced by a soluble toxin elaborated by\r\nthe bacilli.\r\n\r\nThe stage of incubation is from three to five days. The first symptoms\r\nnoted are a disinclination to take nourishment, some drooling from the\r\nmouth, and an examination of the mouth will show on some portion of its\r\nmucous membrane a circumscribed area of infiltration and redness, possibly\r\nan erosion. The latter gradually extends in size and depth, forming a\r\nsharply circumscribed area of necrotic inflammation. It may measure\r\nanywhere from the size of a 5-cent piece to that of a silver dollar or even\r\nlarger. It has the appearance of a corroded surface, under which the mucous\r\nmembrane or muscular tissue seems transformed into a dry, friable, or firm\r\ncheesy mass. It is grayish yellow in color and is bordered by a zone of\r\nthickened tissue slightly reddened and somewhat granulated. The necrotic\r\ntissue is very adherent and can be only partially peeled off. It is\r\nhomogeneous, cheesy, and may extend two fingers' depth into the tissues\r\nbeneath. The general symptoms are languor, weakness, and slight fever. In\r\nspite of plenty of good feed the calf is seen to be failing. It stops\r\nsucking, or, if older, altogether refuses to eat. The temperature at this\r\ntime may be from 104∞ to 107∞ F. The slobber becomes profuse, swallowing\r\nvery difficult, opening of the mouth quite painful, and a most offensive\r\nodor is exhaled. The tongue is swollen and its motion greatly impaired.\r\nSometimes the mouth is kept open, permitting the tumefied tongue to\r\nprotrude. One or more of the above symptoms direct the attention to the\r\nmouth as the seat of disease; or, having noticed the debility and\r\ndisinclination to eat, an examination of the animal may show a lump under\r\nthe neck or swelling of the throat or head. The following extract from a\r\nletter is characteristic:\r\n\r\nI noticed my calves beginning to fail about the first week in December, but\r\ncould not account for it, as they were getting plenty of grain and hay. My\r\nattention was first attracted by a swelling under the neck of one of the\r\ncalves. I cast the animal and found that it was feed that had collected and\r\nthe animal couldn't swallow it. I removed it, and in so doing noticed a\r\nlarge ulcer on the tongue and a very offensive odor. This was the first\r\nknowledge I had of anything being wrong with the calves' mouths. They may\r\nhave been sick for some time before this.\r\n\r\nOut of a herd of 100 belonging to this man, 70 were affected, and the\r\nletter emphasizes the insidious character of the onset.\r\n\r\nThe general affection at this time manifests itself by dejectedness,\r\nextreme weakness, and emaciation, constant lying down, with stiffness and\r\nmarked difficulty in standing.\r\n\r\nThe disease frequently extends to the nasal cavities, producing a thin,\r\nyellowish, or greenish-yellow, sticky discharge which adheres closely to\r\nthe borders of the nostrils. Their edges also show caseous patches similar\r\nto those in the mouth. Sometimes the nasal passage is obstructed by great\r\nmasses of the necrosed exudate, thus causing extreme difficulty in\r\nbreathing. When the caseous process involves the larynx and trachea there\r\nresult cough, wheezing, and dyspnea, together with a yellowish mucopurulent\r\nexpectoration.\r\n\r\nWhen life is prolonged three or four weeks, caseous foci may be established\r\nin the lung, giving rise to all the signs of a bronchopneumonia. Many of\r\nthese cases are associated with a fibrinous pleurisy. The invasion of the\r\ngastrointestinal tract is announced by diarrheal symptoms. This disease\r\nprincipally attacks sucklings not more than 6 weeks of age, but calves 8\r\nand 10 months old are frequently affected, and several cases in adult\r\ncattle have been reported to this office.\r\n\r\nIn its very acute form many of the cases run their course in from five to\r\neight days. In these the local lesions are not strongly marked, and death\r\nseems due to acute intoxication. In other enzootics the majority of the\r\naffected animals live from three to five weeks. These are cases that\r\noccasionally present the pulmonary and intestinal symptoms, and sometimes\r\ndevelop also caseo-necrotic lesions in the liver.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily cases show no tendency to spontaneous cure. Left to themselves\r\nthey die. On the contrary, if taken in hand early, the disease is readily\r\namenable to treatment. In the latter event the prospects of recovery are\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--Necrotic stomatitis may be differentiated from\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease by the fact that in the latter there is a rapid\r\ninfection of the entire herd, including the adult cattle, as well as the\r\ninfection of hogs and sheep. The characteristic lesion of foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease is the appearance of vesicles containing a serous fluid upon the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth and upon the udder, teats, and feet of the\r\naffected animals. In necrotic stomatitis vesicles are never formed,\r\nnecrosis occurring from the beginning and followed by the formation of\r\nyellowish, cheesy patches, principally found in the mouth. Mycotic\r\nstomatitis occurs in only a few animals of the herd, chiefly the adult\r\ncattle, and the lesions produced consist of an inflammation of the mouth\r\nand lips and of the skin between the toes, followed in a few days by small\r\nirregular ulcers in the mouth. This disease appears sporadically, usually\r\nin the early fall after a dry summer, does not run a regular course, and\r\ncan not be inoculated.\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--Prophylaxis should be carried out along three lines:\r\n\r\n(1) Separation of the sick from the healthy animals.\r\n\r\n(2) Close scrutiny and thorough disinfection once or twice daily for five\r\ndays of the mouths and nasal passages of those animals that have been\r\nexposed.\r\n\r\n(3) Complete disinfection of all stalls and sheds.\r\n\r\nThe disease appears to break out in winter and hold over to spring. It is\r\nconceivable that exposure to cold might so disturb the normal circulation\r\nof the oral tissues as to make the mucous membrane an excellent location\r\nfor the causative factor of the disease. There is another possibility,\r\nhowever, which bears on the third line of prophylaxis. The so-called\r\ndiphtheritic inflammations of the vagina and uterus in cows are caused by\r\nthe same organism that induces necrotic stomatitis. A European writer has\r\nrecently pointed out the almost constant relation of such attacks to\r\nprevious occurrences of foul foot or foot rot in the same or other cattle\r\non the place.\r\n\r\nIn all likelihood, in such cases, the stalls and sheds are the harborers of\r\nthis germ. It is possible that many of these outbreaks have some relation\r\nto preceding cases of the above-mentioned diseases and the greater use in\r\nwinter of the stalls and sheds, thus harboring the _Bacillus necrophorus._\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The treatment consists almost solely in careful and extensive\r\ncleansing and disinfection of the mouth and other affected surfaces. The\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth should be copiously irrigated with a 4 per\r\ncent solution of boracic acid in warm water at least twice daily. As\r\nexposure to oxygen kills the bacilli, one need have no fear about\r\ndisturbing or tearing off the caseous patches or necrotic tissue during\r\nirrigation. The irrigation of the sores should then be followed by the\r\napplication with a brush or rag on a stick of a paste made with 1 part of\r\nsalicylic acid and 10 parts of water, or the affected areas may be painted\r\nwith Lugol's solution of iodin (iodin, 1; potassium iodid, 5; water, 200).\r\nFrequent injections of 1 per cent carbolic-acid solution into the mouth\r\nmake an excellent treatment. The internal administration of 2 grams of\r\nsalicylic acid and 3 grams of chlorate of potassium three times a day has\r\nalso proved to be very beneficial when accompanied with local antiseptic\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIGNANT CATARRH.\r\n\r\nMalignant catarrh, or infectious catarrhal fever, is an acute infectious\r\ndisease of cattle preeminently involving the respiratory and digestive\r\ntracts, although the sinuses of the head, the eyes, and the urinary and\r\nsexual organs are very frequently affected. It is relatively rare in this\r\ncountry, being more common on the continent of Europe. Outbreaks have\r\noccurred, however, in Minnesota, New York, and New Jersey. So far the\r\ncausal agent of the disease has never been isolated, and inoculation\r\nexperiments with the view of artificially reproducing the disease have\r\nproved negative in every case. In spite of the foregoing statements the\r\nconsensus of opinion of eminent investigators points to malignant catarrh\r\nas being of specific origin; that is, due to some form of microorganism the\r\ncontagious character of which is poorly developed. This accounts for the\r\nslow transmissibility of the disease from one animal to another. In fact,\r\nmalignant catarrh is a type of that class of affections scientifically\r\nknown as miasmatic diseases; that is, they remain stationary in stables\r\nwith damp floors, low ceilings, poor ventilation, and bad sanitary\r\nconditions in general. Such places furnish a favorable seat of propagation\r\nfor the infective material, and it will remain active for a long time,\r\ncausing the loss of a few animals each year. One European veterinarian\r\nreports an instance in which the disease remained for 25 years on the same\r\nfarm, attacking in all 225 animals, with a mortality of about 98 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe disease is most common in late winter and early spring, at all\r\naltitudes, and has a special preference for young, well-nourished cattle,\r\nalthough older animals are not immune. The time between the entrance of the\r\ninfective principle into the body of the animal and the appearance of the\r\nfirst symptoms is relatively very long, averaging, according to German\r\ninvestigators, from 20 to 30 days. Fortunately, it is not a disease which\r\nspreads to any great extent or which causes severe losses, and hence\r\nlegislative enactments do not seem to be necessary for its restriction.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--These are extremely variable according to the point of\r\nlocalization of the lesions. It is usually ushered in with a chill,\r\nfollowed by a marked rise of temperature (104∞ to 107∞ F.). The head\r\ndroops, the skin is hot and dry, and the coat staring. Quivering of the\r\nmuscles in various parts of the body is frequently observed. Marked\r\ndullness of the animal, passing, according to some observers, into an\r\nalmost stupefied condition later on, is quite common. The secretion of milk\r\nstops in the beginning of the disease, and loss of flesh, invariably\r\nassociated with the disease, is extremely marked and rapid. The lesions of\r\nthe eyes may best be likened to moon blindness (periodic ophthalmia) in\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nThere is first an abundant secretion of tears, which run down the face. The\r\nlids are swollen and inflamed, and indeed this may be so marked as to cause\r\ninvoluntary eversion, exposing the reddened conjunctiva to view. Sunlight\r\nis painful, as is shown by the fact that the animal keeps the eyes\r\ncontinuously closed. This inflammation may extend to the cornea, causing it\r\nto assume a slightly clouded appearance in mild cases or a chalky whiteness\r\nin more severe affection. Cases of ulceration of the cornea followed by\r\nperforation and subsequent escape of the aqueous humor, leading to\r\nshrinking of the eyeball and permanent loss of sight, have been recorded,\r\nbut these are relatively rare, although slight inflammation of the deeper\r\nstructures of the eye (iris) are more frequent. In mild cases this\r\ninflammation may undergo complete resolution, but more frequently permanent\r\ncloudliness of the cornea, either diffuse or in spots (leucoma), is the\r\nresult. The mucous membrane of the mouth, nose, sinuses of the head,\r\nthroat, and lower respiratory passages are also involved. It is first\r\ncatarrhal in character, but soon a false or diphtheritic membrane is\r\nformed, with the production of shallow ulcers. There is dribbling of saliva\r\nfrom the mouth and discharge from the nose, at first watery, becoming\r\nthicker and mixed with blood and small masses of cast-off croupous\r\nmembrane, causing a very fetid odor. These croupous areas when they form in\r\nthe throat, larynx, or windpipe, may lead to narrowing of the passages,\r\nwith consequent difficult breathing and even suffocation. Various\r\nrespiratory murmurs may also be heard, caused by the to-and-fro movement of\r\nmucus and inflammatory deposits along the air passages. There is also\r\ninflammation of the horn core with consequent loosening of the horn shell,\r\nand the horns are thus readily knocked off by the uneasy, blind sufferer.\r\nThe animal may refuse all feed from the time of the initial rise of\r\ntemperature, or in less severe cases, and especially when the lesions of\r\nthe digestive tract are not so marked, the appetite may remain until the\r\ndisease is well advanced. Constipation is quite common at the commencement\r\nof the attack, followed by diarrhea and severe straining, the evacuations\r\nbecoming very soft, fetid, and streaked with blood. Cases of the evacuation\r\nof desquamated patches of diphtheritic membrane from the intestinal mucosa\r\n6 to 9 feet in length have been reported. The kidneys and bladder are\r\nusually inflamed, the urine being voided with difficulty and the animal\r\nevincing signs of pain. Inflammatory elements, as albumen, casts, etc., may\r\nbe seen on examination of the urine. In cows the mucous membrane of the\r\nvestibule is congested, swollen, and may contain ulcers and an excessive\r\nquantity of mucus. Abortion during advanced pregnancy is not infrequent,\r\nfollowing a severe attack. In connection with these various symptoms there\r\nmay be much uneasiness on the part of the animal, leading in some cases to\r\nmadness and furious delirium, in others to spasms and convulsions or\r\nparalysis. A vesicular eruption of the skin may occur, seen principally\r\nbetween the toes and on the inside of the flank and in the armpits, with\r\nsubsequent loss of hair and epidermis.\r\n\r\nLike other infectious diseases, malignant catarrh pursues a longer or\r\nshorter course in accordance with the severity of the attack. In acute\r\ncases death is said to take place three to seven days after the appearance\r\nof symptoms. Recovery, if it occurs, may take three or four weeks.\r\nAccording to statistics, from 50 to 90 per cent of the affected animals\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nIf animals which have died of this disease are examined, in addition to the\r\nchanges of the mucous membrane of mouth and nasal cavities referred to\r\nabove, shallow ulcers in these situations will be found occasionally. These\r\nnecrotic processes may pass beneath the mucous membrane and even involve\r\nthe underlying bony structure. In severe cases membranous (croupous)\r\ndeposits are found in the throat. Similar deposits have been found upon the\r\nmucous membrane of the fourth stomach and intestine, which is always\r\ninflamed. There is more or less inflammation of the membranes of the brain,\r\nkidneys, and liver, and some fatty degeneration of the voluntary muscles.\r\nIn countries where rinderpest occasionally appears it may be difficult to\r\ndistinguish between it and malignant catarrh, owing to a general similarity\r\nof the symptoms. The principal points to be observed in differentiating\r\nbetween the two are the very slight transmissibility of the latter as\r\ncompared with the intense contagiousness of the former, and the tendency of\r\nmalignant catarrh to run a more chronic course than rinderpest, which\r\nusually results fatally in a very few days. Only a trained veterinarian who\r\ntakes into consideration all the different symptoms and lesions of both\r\ndiseases should decide in such cases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--There is no specific treatment for this affection. Copious\r\nblood letting in the earliest stages has been highly recommended, however,\r\nas this has a tendency to deplete the system and lessen the exudation of\r\ninflammatory products. Antiseptic washes, such as 4 per cent boric-acid\r\nsolution to the eyes and Dobell's solution applied to the nose and mouth\r\nwith ice poultices over the crest of the head and frontal region, have also\r\nproved efficacious. Calomel should also be given in 1-dram doses twice a\r\nday for three days, and in severe cases, involving the respiratory tract, a\r\npowder containing ferrous sulphate, quinin, and subnitrate of bismuth,\r\ngiven twice a day, will be found beneficial. At the same time it must be\r\nremembered that much greater success is to be looked for in the preventive\r\ntreatment. This consists in the removal of the healthy from the infected\r\nanimals (not vice versa) and thorough cleaning and disinfecting of the\r\ncontaminated stables. If the floors are low and damp, they should be raised\r\nand made dry. If this can not be done, place a layer of cement under the\r\nstable floor to prevent water from entering from below. The stable should\r\nbe well ventilated and the soil in the pastures thoroughly drained. If this\r\nis carefully carried out, the contagion should be destroyed and the danger\r\nof the reappearance of the disease in a great measure lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\nMALIGNANT EDEMA.\r\n\r\nMalignant edema, also termed gangrenous septicemia, is an acute,\r\ninflammatory disease of domestic and wild animals, resulting from the\r\nintroduction of a specific organism into the deep connective tissues of a\r\nsusceptible animal and proving fatal in many instances within 24 to 48\r\nhours. The disease may be inoculated from one animal to another, but only\r\nby inserting the virus deeply below the skin. It is infrequently met with\r\nin cattle, but may follow operating wounds, as roweling, castration, and\r\nphlebotomy, which have become infected with septic matter, soil, or unclean\r\ninstruments. In the pathological laboratory of the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry the organism has also been obtained from the infected muscles of a\r\ncalf that was supposed to have died of blackleg, and, as a result, all\r\nblackleg virus is thoroughly tested before it is made into blackleg vaccine\r\nin order to exclude the malignant-edema organism. The essential cause of\r\nmalignant edema is a long, slender, motile, spore-bearing bacillus,\r\nresembling the bacillus of blackleg, and which can develop only in the\r\nabsence of the atmosphere. Unlike the bacilli of anthrax and blackleg,\r\nwhich are confined to certain districts, this organism is widely\r\ndistributed and found in ordinary garden soil, foul water, and in the\r\nnormal intestinal tract of the herbivora. It may be brought to the surface\r\nof the soil by growing plants, rains, winds, or burrowing insects and\r\nrodents. In animals that have succumbed to the disease the germ is confined\r\nto the seat of infection, but a few hours after death it may migrate\r\nthrough the blood channels to other parts of the body. The bacillus may\r\nattack man, horses, asses, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and poultry.\r\nAdult cattle, although refractory to experimental inoculation, suffer from\r\nnatural infection, while calves are susceptible to both these methods of\r\nexposure. (Kitt.) The introduction of the bacillus into abrasions of the\r\nskin and superficial sores rarely does any harm, because the germ is\r\nquickly destroyed by contact with air. If, however, the organisms are\r\ninserted deeply into the subcutaneous tissues of susceptible animals, they\r\nquickly develop, producing a soluble poison, which is the fatal agent.\r\n\r\nIn lamb-shearing season, or after docking or castration, the mortality is\r\nhigher among these animals because of wounds inflicted at such times. The\r\napplication of antiseptics to wounds thus made will reduce the percentage\r\nof deaths to a minimum.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Usually the first symptoms are overlooked. In the early stages\r\nthe animal appears listless, disinclined to move about, and lies down in\r\nshady and quiet places. If forced to move about, the hind legs are drawn\r\nforward with a peculiar, stiff, dragging movement, and there may be slight\r\nmuscular trembling over all the body, which becomes more intense as the\r\ndisease progresses. When driven, the animal shows signs of fatigue,\r\nultimately dropping to the ground completely exhausted. Breathing becomes\r\nfast and painful, with frequent spasmodic jerks.\r\n\r\nThe pulse is quick and weak and the temperature is 106∞ to 107∞ F. An\r\nedematous, doughy, and painful swelling appears at the point of infection.\r\nThis tumefaction spreads more and more, and crackles on pressure. In case\r\nof an open wound, a fetid liquid and frothy discharge is observed. The\r\ncenter of the swelling may appear soft and jellylike, while the margin is\r\ntense, hot, and painful. The symptoms increase rapidly, resulting in coma\r\nand death.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--After death the fat and subcutaneous tissues surrounding the\r\ninfected area are infiltrated with a yellow gelatinous material containing\r\nan orange-colored foam, due to the presence of gas bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe muscles at this point are friable, spongy, and of a uniform brownish\r\ntint, dissociated by gas and with a blood-tinged exudate. This gangrenous\r\ntissue, when present before death, can be removed without pain to the\r\nanimal. The intestines are generally normal, but, together with the\r\nperitoneum, they may be inflamed, and the lungs are usually the seat of an\r\nedema. The spleen, liver, and kidneys retain their normal appearance, in\r\nmarked contrast with anthrax.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--Unlike blackleg, this disease never appears as\r\nan epizootic but in isolated cases. It may also be differentiated from the\r\nformer by the history of a recent parturition or surgical operation, by the\r\npresence of an external injury at the site of the swelling accompanied with\r\na fetid liquid discharge, and the gangrenous appearance of the tumefaction.\r\nMan is susceptible to malignant edema, but not to blackleg. Malignant edema\r\nmay also be easily differentiated from anthrax in that the blood and spleen\r\nare normal in appearance, while in the latter disease the blood is dark and\r\nof a tarlike consistency, and the spleen appears swollen, injected, and\r\nsoftened. The local tumor in malignant edema contains gas bubbles, which\r\nare absent in anthrax swellings. Inoculation experiments of guinea pigs,\r\nrabbits, and chickens will also disclose the differences among the\r\nabove-mentioned three diseases, since all these species are killed by the\r\ngerm of malignant edema, only the first two species by the anthrax\r\nbacillus, while the guinea pig alone will succumb to the blackleg\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment is chiefly surgical and consists in laying the\r\ninfected areas wide open by free incision, followed by a liberal\r\napplication of a 30 per cent solution of hydrogen dioxid and subsequently a\r\n5 per cent solution of carbolic acid. Usually the disease when observed has\r\nadvanced to such an extent that medicinal interference is without avail.\r\nPreventive treatment is by far the most desirable, and consists,\r\nessentially, in a thorough disinfection of all accidental and surgical\r\nwounds, the cleansing of the skin, and the exclusion of soil, filth, and\r\nbacteria during surgical operations of any nature. Sheds, barns, and\r\nstables should receive a thorough application of quicklime or crude\r\ncarbolic acid wash after all rubbish has been removed and burned. All dead\r\nanimals should be burned or deeply buried and covered well with quicklime.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CATTLE FEVER (TEXAS FEVER, TICK FEVER).\r\n\r\n[Pls. XLIV-XLIX.]\r\n\r\nThis disease, which is more commonly known as Texas fever, and sometimes as\r\nsplenetic fever, is a specific fever communicated by cattle which have\r\nrecently been moved northward from the infected district; it is also\r\ncontracted by cattle taken into the infected district from other parts of\r\nthe world. It is characterized by the peculiarity among animal diseases\r\nthat the animals which disseminate the infection are apparently in good\r\nhealth, while those which sicken and die from it do not, as a rule, infect\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIt is accompanied with high fever, greatly enlarged spleen, destruction of\r\nthe red blood corpuscles, escape of the coloring matter of the blood\r\nthrough the kidneys, giving the urine a deep-red color, with a yellowness\r\nof the mucous membranes and fat, which is seen more especially in fat\r\ncattle, by a rapid loss of strength, and with fatal results in a large\r\nproportion of cases.\r\n\r\nThis disease has various names in different sections of the country where\r\nit frequently appears. It is often called Spanish fever, acclimation fever,\r\nred water, black water, distemper, murrain, dry murrain, yellow murrain,\r\nbloody murrain, Australian tick fever, and tristeza of South America.\r\n\r\nThe earliest accounts we have of this disease date back to 1814, when it\r\nwas stated by Dr. James Mease, before the Philadelphia Society for\r\nPromoting Agriculture, that the cattle from a certain district in South\r\nCarolina so certainly disease all others with which they mix in their\r\nprogress to the North that they are prohibited by the people of Virginia\r\nfrom passing through the State; that these cattle infect others while they\r\nthemselves are in perfect health, and that cattle from Europe or the\r\ninterior taken to the vicinity of the sea are attacked by a disease that\r\ngenerally proves fatal. Similar observations have been made in regard to a\r\ndistrict in the southern part of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe northern limits of this area are changed yearly as a result of the\r\ndissemination or eradication of the cattle tick along the border, but the\r\ninfected area has gradually decreased, owing to the successful endeavors\r\npushed forward to eliminate the ticks.\r\n\r\nIt was the frequent and severe losses following the driving of cattle from\r\nthe infected district in Texas into and across the Western States and\r\nTerritories which led to the disease being denominated Texas fever. It is\r\nnow known, however, that the infection is not peculiar to Texas or even to\r\nthe United States, but that it also exists in southern Europe, Central and\r\nSouth America, Australia, South Africa, and the West Indies.\r\n\r\nWhen cattle from other sections of the country are taken into the infected\r\ndistrict they contract this disease usually during the first summer, and if\r\nthey are adult animals, particularly milch cows or fat cattle, nearly all\r\ndie. Calves are much more likely to survive. The disease is one from which\r\nimmunity is acquired, and therefore calves which recover are not again\r\nattacked, as a rule, even after they become adult.\r\n\r\nWhen the infection is disseminated beyond the permanently infected\r\ndistrict, the roads, pastures, pens, and other inclosures are dangerous for\r\nsusceptible animals until freezing weather. The infection then disappears,\r\nand cattle may be driven over the grounds or kept in the inclosures the\r\nsucceeding summer and the disease will not reappear. There are some\r\nexceptions to this rule in the section just north of the boundary line of\r\nthe infected district. In this locality the infection sometimes resists the\r\nwinters, especially if they are mild.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the manner in which the disease is communicated, experience\r\nshows that this does not occur by animals coming near or in contact with\r\none another. It is an indirect infection. The cattle from the infected\r\ndistrict first infect the pastures, roads, pens, cars, etc., whence the\r\nsusceptible cattle obtain the virus secondhand. Usually animals do not\r\ncontract the disease when separated from infected pastures by a fence. If,\r\nhowever, there is any drainage or washing by rains across the line of fence\r\nthis rule does not hold good.\r\n\r\nThe investigations made by the Bureau of Animal Industry demonstrate that\r\nthe ticks which adhere to cattle from the infected district are the only\r\nknown means of conveying the infection to susceptible cattle. The infection\r\nis not spread by the saliva, the urine, or the manure of cattle from the\r\ninfected district. In studying the causation and prevention of this\r\ndisease, attention must therefore be largely given to the tick, and it now\r\nseems apparent that if cattle could be freed from this parasite when\r\nleaving the infected district they would not be able to spread the malady.\r\nThe discovery of the connection of the ticks with the production of the\r\ndisease has played a very important part in determining the methods that\r\nshould be adopted in preventing its spread. It established an essential\r\npoint and indicated many lines of investigation which have yielded and are\r\nstill likely to yield very important results.\r\n\r\n_Nature of the disease._--Texas fever is caused by an organism which lives\r\nwithin the red blood corpuscles and breaks them up. It is therefore simply\r\na blood disease. The organism does not belong to the bacteria but to the\r\nprotozoa. It is not, in other words, a microscopic plant, but it belongs to\r\nthe lowest forms of the animal kingdom. This very minute organism\r\nmultiplies very rapidly in the body of the infected animal, and in acute\r\ncases causes an enormous destruction of red corpuscles in a few days. How\r\nit gets into the red corpuscle it is not possible to state, but it appears\r\nthat it enters as an exceedingly minute body, probably endowed with motion,\r\nand only after it has succeeded in entering the corpuscle does it begin to\r\nenlarge. Plate XLV, figure 4, illustrates an early stage of this blood\r\nparasite. The red corpuscle contains a very minute, roundish body which is\r\nstained blue to bring it into view. The body is, as a rule, situated near\r\nthe edge of the corpuscle. Figure 5 illustrates an older stage in the\r\ngrowth of the parasite, in fact the largest which has thus far been\r\ndetected. It will be noticed that there are usually two bodies in a\r\ncorpuscle. These bodies are in general pear-shaped. The narrow ends are\r\nalways toward each other when two are present in the same corpuscle. If we\r\nbear in mind that the average diameter of the red blood corpuscles of\r\ncattle is from 1/4000 to 1/5000 inch, the size of the contained parasite\r\nmay be at once appreciated by a glance at the figures referred to.\r\n\r\nThe various disease processes which go on in Texas fever, and which we may\r\nobserve by examining the organs after death, all result from the\r\ndestruction of the red corpuscles; this destruction may be extremely rapid\r\nor slow. When it is rapid we have the acute, usually fatal, type of Texas\r\nfever, which is always witnessed in the height of the Texas-fever season,\r\nthat is, during the latter weeks of August and the early weeks of\r\nSeptember. When the destruction of corpuscles is slower, a mild, usually\r\nnonfatal, type of the disease is called forth, which is only witnessed late\r\nin autumn or more rarely in July and the early part of August. Cases of the\r\nmild type occurring thus early usually become acute later and terminate\r\nfatally.\r\n\r\nThe acute disease is fatal in most cases, and the fatality is due not so\r\nmuch to the loss of blood corpuscles as to the difficulty which the organs\r\nhave in getting rid of the waste products arising from this wholesale\r\ndestruction. How great this may be a simple calculation will serve to\r\nillustrate. In a steer weighing 1,000 pounds, the blood in its body weighs\r\nabout 50 pounds, if we assume that the blood represents one-twentieth of\r\nthe weight of the body, which is a rather low estimate. According to\r\nexperimental determination at the bureau station, which consists in\r\ncounting the number of blood corpuscles in a given quantity of blood from\r\nday to day in such an animal, the corpuscles contained in from 5 to 10\r\npounds of blood may be destroyed within 24 hours. The remains of these\r\ncorpuscles and the coloring matter in them must be either converted into\r\nbile or excreted unchanged. The result of this effort on the part of the\r\nliver causes extensive disease of this organ. The bile secreted by the\r\nliver cells contains so much solid material that it stagnates in the finest\r\nbile canals and chokes these up completely. This in turn interferes with\r\nthe nutrition of the liver cells and they undergo fatty degeneration and\r\nperish. The functions of the liver are thereby completely suspended and\r\ndeath is the result. This enormous destruction of corpuscles takes place to\r\na large extent in the kidneys, where a great number of corpuscles\r\ncontaining the parasites are always found in acute cases. This accounts\r\nlargely for the blood-colored urine, or red water, which is such a\r\ncharacteristic feature of Texas fever. The corpuscles themselves are not\r\nfound in the urine; it is the red coloring matter, or hemoglobin, which\r\nleaves them when they break up and pass into the urine.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--After a period of exposure to infected soil, which may vary\r\nfrom 13 to 90 days, and which will be more fully discussed under the\r\nsubject of cattle ticks as bearers of the Texas-fever parasite, the disease\r\nfirst shows itself in dullness, loss of appetite, and a tendency to leave\r\nthe herd and stand or lie down alone. A few days before these symptoms\r\nappear the presence of a high fever may be detected by the clinical\r\nthermometer. The temperature rises from a normal of 101∞ to 103∞ F. to 106∞\r\nand 107∞ F. There seems to be little or no change in temperature until\r\nrecovery or death ensues. The period of high temperature or fever varies\r\nconsiderably. As it indicates the intensity of the disease process going on\r\nwithin, the higher it is the more rapid the fatal end. When it does not\r\nrise above 104∞ F. the disease is milder and more prolonged.\r\n\r\nThe bowels are mostly constipated during the fever; toward the end the\r\nfeces may become softer and rather deeply tinged with bile. The urine shows\r\nnothing abnormal during the course of the disease until near the fatal\r\ntermination, when it may be deeply stained with the coloring matter of the\r\nblood. (Hemoglobinuria; see Pl. XLV, fig. 3.) Although this symptom is\r\noccasionally observed in animals which recover, yet it may generally be\r\nregarded as an indication of approaching death. The pulse and respiration\r\nare usually much more rapid than during health.\r\n\r\nOther symptoms in addition to those mentioned have been described by\r\nobservers, but they do not seem to be constant, and only those described\r\nabove are nearly always present. As the end approaches emaciation becomes\r\nvery marked, the blood is very thin and watery, and the closing of any\r\nwound of the skin by clots is retarded. The animal manifests increasing\r\nstupor and may lie down much of the time. Signs of delirium have been\r\nobserved in some cases. Death occurs most frequently in the night.\r\n\r\nThe duration of the disease is very variable. Death may ensue in from three\r\ndays to several weeks after the beginning of the fever. Those that recover\r\nultimately do so very slowly, owing to the great poverty of the blood in\r\nred corpuscles. The flesh is regained but very gradually, and the animal\r\nmay be subjected to a second, though mild, attack later on in the autumn,\r\nwhich pushes the full recovery onward to the beginning of winter.\r\n\r\nIn the mild type of the disease, which occurs in October and November,\r\nsymptoms of disease are well-nigh absent. There is little if any fever, and\r\nif it were not for loss of flesh and more or less dullness the disease may\r\npass unnoticed, as it undoubtedly does in a majority of cases. If, however,\r\nthe blood corpuscles are counted from time to time a gradually diminishing\r\nnumber will be found, and after several weeks only about one-fifth or\r\none-sixth of the normal number are present. It is indeed surprising how little\r\nimpression upon the animal this very impoverished condition of the blood\r\nappears to make. It is probable, however, that if two animals kept under\r\nthe same conditions, one healthy and the other at the end of one of these\r\nmild attacks, are weighed, the difference would be plainly shown.\r\n\r\n_Pathological changes observable after death._--In the preceding pages some\r\nof these have already been referred to in describing the nature of the\r\ndisease. It is very important at times to determine whether a certain\r\ndisease is Texas fever or some other disease, like anthrax, for example.\r\nThis fact can, as a rule, be determined at once by a thorough microscopic\r\nexamination of the blood. The necessary apparatus and the requisite\r\nqualifications for this task leave this method entirely in the hands of\r\nexperts. There are, however, a considerable number of changes caused by\r\nthis disease which may be detected by the naked eye when the body has been\r\nopened. Put together they make a mistake quite impossible. The presence of\r\nsmall ticks on the skin of the escutcheon, the thighs, and the udder is a\r\nvery important sign in herds north of the Texas-fever line, as it indicates\r\nthat they have been brought in some manner from the South and have carried\r\nthe disease with them, as will be explained later. Another very important\r\nsign is the thin, watery condition of the blood, either just before death\r\nor when the fever has been present for four or five days. A little incision\r\ninto the skin will enable any one to determine this point. Frequently the\r\nskin is so poor in blood that it may require several incisions to draw a\r\ndrop or more.\r\n\r\nThe changes in the internal organs, as found on post-mortem examinations,\r\nare briefly as follows: The spleen, or milt, is much larger than in healthy\r\nanimals. It may weigh three or four times as much. When it is incised the\r\ncontents or pulp is blackish (see Pl. XLIV, fig. 1), and may even well out\r\nas a disintegrated mass. The markings of the healthy spleen (fig. 2) are\r\nall effaced by the enormous number of blood corpuscles which have collected\r\nin it, and to which the enlargement is attributable. Next to the spleen the\r\nliver will arouse our attention. (See Pl. XLV, fig. 2.) It is larger than\r\nin the healthy state, has lost its natural brownish color (fig. 1), and now\r\nhas on the surface a paler, yellowish hue. When it is incised this\r\nyellowish tinge, or mahogany color, as it has been called by some, is still\r\nmore prominent. This is owing to the large quantity of bile in the finest\r\nbile capillaries, and as these are not uniformly filled with it the cut\r\nsurface has a more or less mottled appearance. This bile injection causes\r\nin many cases a fatty degeneration of the liver cells, which makes the\r\norgan appear still lighter in color.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the gall bladder should be examined. This is distended with\r\nbile, which holds in suspension a large number of yellow flakes, so that\r\nwhen it is poured into a tall bottle to settle fully one-half or more of\r\nthe column of fluid will be occupied by a layer of flakes. If mucus is\r\npresent at the same time, the bile may become so viscid that when it is\r\npoured from one glass to another it forms long bands. The bile in health is\r\na limpid fluid, containing no solid particles.\r\n\r\nIf the animal during life has not been observed to pass urine colored with\r\nblood or red water, the bladder should be opened. This quite invariably, in\r\nacute cases, contains urine which varies in color from a deep port wine to\r\na light claret. In many cases the color is so dense that light will not\r\npass through even a thin layer. (Pl. XLV, fig. 3.) The kidneys are always\r\nfound congested in the acute attack. The disease exerts but little effect\r\non the stomach and intestines beyond more or less reddening of the mucous\r\nmembrane; hence an examination of them may be safely omitted. The lungs\r\nare, as a rule, not diseased. The heart usually shows patches of blood\r\nextravasation on the inside (left ventricle) and less markedly on the outer\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nWe have observed jaundice of the various tissues but very rarely. It has\r\nbeen observed by some quite regularly, however.\r\n\r\nDuring the hot season about 90 per cent of the susceptible mature animals\r\nfrom a noninfected district die, but later, in the cool weather, the\r\ndisease assumes a milder type, with a consequent decrease in the number of\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\n_The cattle tick, Margaropus annulatus, as the carrier of Texas fever._\r\n(Pls. XLVI, XLVII, and XLVIII.)--The cattle tick is, as its name indicates,\r\na parasite of cattle in the southern part of the United States. It belongs\r\nto the group of Arthropoda and to the genus _Margaropus_ (or _Boophilus_),\r\nwhich is included in the order Acarina. Its life history is quite simple\r\nand easily traced from one generation to another. It is essentially a\r\nparasite, attaching itself to the skin (Pl. XLVIII) and drawing the blood\r\nof its host. It is unable to come to maturity and reproduce its kind unless\r\nit becomes attached to the skin of cattle, whence it may obtain its food.\r\n\r\nThe eggs laid on the ground after the female has dropped from the host\r\nbegin to develop at once. When the embryo is fully formed within the shell\r\nit ruptures this and gains its freedom. The time required from the laying\r\nof the eggs to their hatching varies considerably, according to the\r\ntemperature. In the laboratory in the heat of midsummer this was\r\naccomplished in about 13 days. In the late fall, under the same conditions,\r\nit required from four to six weeks. The larva after emerging from the egg\r\nis very minute, six-legged, and is just visible to the naked eye. (Pl.\r\nXLVI, fig. 3.) If these larvÊ are kept on a layer of moist sand or earth in\r\na covered dish, they may remain alive for months, but there is no\r\nappreciable increase in size. So soon, however, as they are placed upon\r\ncattle growth begins.\r\n\r\nOn pastures these little creatures soon find their way on to cattle. They\r\nattach themselves by preference to the tender skin on the escutcheon, the\r\ninside of the thighs, and on the base of the udder. Yet when they are very\r\nnumerous they may be found in small numbers on various parts of the body,\r\nsuch as the neck, the chest, and the ears. (Pl. XLVIII and Pl. XLIX, fig.\r\n1.)\r\n\r\nThe changes which they undergo during their parasitic existence were first\r\nstudied by Dr. Cooper Curtice, of the Bureau of Animal Industry, in 1889.\r\nThe young tick molts within a week, and the second or nymphal stage of the\r\nparasite's life is thus ushered in. After this change it has four pairs of\r\nlegs. Within another week another molt takes place by which the tick passes\r\nfrom the nymphal to the sexual, or adult, stage. Impregnation now takes\r\nplace, and, with the development of the ova in the body, the tick takes an\r\nincreased quantity of blood, so that in a few days it becomes very much\r\nlarger. That the rapid growth is due to the blood taken in may be easily\r\nproved by crushing one. The intestine is distended with a thick, tarry mass\r\ncomposed of partly digested blood. When the female has reached a certain\r\nstage of maturity she drops to the ground and begins to lay a large number\r\nof eggs, which hatch in the time given above.\r\n\r\nThe life of the cattle tick is thus spent largely on cattle, and although\r\nthe young, or larvÊ may live for a long time on the ground in the summer\r\nseason, they can not mature except as parasites on cattle and horses. We\r\nhave purposely omitted various details of the life history, including that\r\nof the male, as they are not necessary to an understanding of our present\r\nsubject--Texas fever. How this is transmitted we will proceed to consider.\r\nBefore the enforcement of the Federal quarantine southern cattle sent north\r\nduring the spring and summer months carried on their bodies large numbers\r\nof the cattle ticks, which, when matured, would drop off and lay their eggs\r\nin the northern pastures. After hatching, the young ticks would soon get\r\nupon any northern cattle which happened to be on the pasture. So soon as\r\nthey attached themselves to the skin they inoculated the cattle, and Texas\r\nfever would break out a week or more thereafter. For many years there had\r\nbeen a growing suspicion that the cattle tick was in some way concerned in\r\nthe spread of Texas fever, and the facts which supported this supposition\r\nfinally became so numerous and convincing that a series of experiments was\r\ninaugurated by the Bureau of Animal Industry which served to show that the\r\ntick is abundantly able to carry the disease to a herd of healthy cattle,\r\nand, in fact, is probably the only agent concerned in the transmission of\r\nthe disease from southern cattle to susceptible northern animals.\r\n\r\n_Injurious effects of cattle ticks._--Unfortunately many cattle owners who\r\nhave always been accustomed to see both ticks and ticky cattle on their\r\nfarms are not inclined to attach much importance to these parasites, and,\r\nas a rule, through lack of appreciation of their damaging effects, placidly\r\nconsider them as of little consequence. That ticks may be detrimental to\r\ntheir hosts in several ways has probably not suggested itself to these\r\nstockmen, who are most vitally affected, and it therefore seems necessary\r\nto emphasize the fact that, in addition to their relation to Texas fever,\r\nthey may also be injurious to cattle as external parasites. While the power\r\nof transmitting Texas fever is undoubtedly the most dangerous property\r\npossessed by the cattle tick and is the principal cause for adopting\r\nstringent measures looking to its complete eradication, nevertheless there\r\nstill remain other good reasons for the accomplishment of this achievement.\r\nThese secondary objections to the presence of ticks on cattle consists in\r\nthe physical harm they do to the host aside from the production of the\r\nspecific disease of Texas fever. True, a few parasites may remain on cattle\r\nindefinitely without causing any noticeable effect, but it is not uncommon\r\nto notice bovine animals on pastures with their hides heavily infested with\r\nthese pests. In such cases it can readily be seen that the continuous\r\nsucking of blood causes more or less impoverishment of the circulation. The\r\nanimal must therefore be fed more in order to meet the demands of the\r\nparasites in addition to the ordinary needs of the host. If the ticks are\r\nremoved from the body, the bites inflicted are often distinguished by\r\nsmall, inflamed or reddened areas somewhat swollen, with perforations of\r\nthe skin which may allow the entrance of various kinds of disease germs,\r\nand showing that more or less irritation of the hide is produced by these\r\nparasites. This condition, together with the loss of blood, frequently\r\ninduces an irritable state and evidence of uneasiness commonly known as\r\n\"tick worry,\" which results in the loss of energy and other derangements of\r\nthe animal's health. It may in some cases, especially in hot weather,\r\nbecome so pronounced that the animal will lose flesh in spite of good\r\npasturing, thereby reducing the vitality and rendering it more susceptible\r\nto the inroads of disease. Moreover, if the infestation of ticks is not\r\ncontrolled, the cattle may be so reduced in condition that growth is\r\nretarded, and, in the case of young animals, they may never become fully\r\ndeveloped, but remain thin, weak, and stunted--a condition that has been\r\ntermed \"tick poverty\"--and easily succumb to other diseases as a result of\r\nlowered vitality. In milch cows this debilitating influence of the numerous\r\nticks is shown in a greatly reduced milk supply. This should not appear\r\nstrange when it is considered that some animals harbor several thousand of\r\nthe bloodsucking parasites. If these parasites are crushed, it will be\r\nfound that their intestines are completely filled with a dark, thick mass\r\nof blood abstracted from the animal host and containing nutriment that\r\nshould go to the formation of milk, flesh, and the laying on of fat. In\r\nsome rare cases the large number of bites on a limited area of skin may be\r\nfollowed by infection with pus-producing organisms, giving rise to small\r\nabscesses which may terminate in ulcers. The discharge from these sores, or\r\nin some cases the mere oozing of blood serum through the incision made by\r\nthe mouth parts of the ticks, keeps the hair moist and matted together, and\r\nthe laying and hatching of fly eggs in these areas give rise to infestation\r\nwith destructive maggots, causing ulcers and other complications that\r\nrequire medical treatment. These statements regarding the secondary\r\ninjurious effects of cattle ticks also apply to those ticks which have been\r\npreviously spoken of as harmless so far as Texas fever is concerned, and,\r\nin fact, to all external parasites. Therefore, it is just as important to\r\neradicate the cattle ticks for reasons other than those associated with\r\nTexas fever as it is to exterminate lice, fleas, and other vermin.\r\nFurthermore, cattle ticks, aside from the losses sustained by their purely\r\nparasitic effects, are the greatest menace to the profitable raising and\r\nfeeding of cattle in the South, because they are an obstacle to cattle\r\ntraffic between the infected and noninfected districts.\r\n\r\n_Loss occasioned by cattle ticks._--The economic aspect of the tick problem\r\nis unquestionably of the greatest practical interest, since the fundamental\r\nimportance of all the other questions which surround it depends upon the\r\nactual money value involved. A careful and conservative estimate made in\r\n1916 placed the annual loss caused by the ticks in the United States at\r\n$40,000,000, and indicated that the ticks also lowered the assets of the\r\nSouth by an additional $33,000,000. The principal items in these losses are\r\nset forth below.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that those animals coming from an infected district and\r\nsold in the \"southern pens\" of northern stockyards bring about one-half a\r\ncent less per pound than the quoted market price. The handicap that is\r\nplaced on the southern cattle raiser as a result of this decrease in value\r\nof his stock will average at this figure $3 per head, allowing an\r\nindividual weight of 600 pounds for all classes of animals. This decreased\r\nvalue reacts and fixes the valuation of all cattle which remain in the\r\ninfected territory, thereby reducing the assets of the cattle industry of\r\nthat section. In addition there is a very great loss from the decrease in\r\nflesh and lack of development of southern cattle occasioned by the\r\nparasitic life of the ticks from without and by the blood-destroying and\r\nenervating properties of the protozoan parasites from within.\r\n\r\nThe presence of the tick among the cattle of the South not only lessens the\r\nvalue of the cattle on the hoof but causes the gradings of hides that have\r\nbeen infested with ticks as No. 4 quality. The same hide, if free from tick\r\nmarks, would grade No. 2. The difference in price between these two grades\r\nof hides is 3 cents a pound. As the hide of a southern steer weighs about\r\n42 pounds, the presence of the tick in the hide causes a loss in the hide\r\nalone of more than $1.26 a hide. It has been shown that the cost of tick\r\neradication is only about 50 cents a head, so that if the counties make a\r\nsystematic campaign to eradicate the tick, the increase in value of the\r\nhide alone would pay for the cost of tick eradication and leave the farmer\r\na net profit of about 76 cents a hide.\r\n\r\nThe shrinkage in the milk production of cattle harboring many ticks will\r\naverage 1 quart a day, which in the aggregate is a heavy loss. The damage\r\nresulting to the southern purchaser of northern purebred or high-grade\r\ncattle is another item of no small moment. About 10 per cent of all such\r\ncattle taken into the South die of Texas fever, even after they are\r\nimmunized by blood inoculations, and about 60 per cent of them succumb to\r\nTexas fever when not so treated. As they are usually very expensive animals\r\nand of a highly valued strain of blood, the loss in certain cases is\r\nexcessive and in others almost irreparable, owing to the possible\r\nextinction of some particular type especially selected for the improvement\r\nof the herd.\r\n\r\nAnother instance in which it is difficult to figure the injury done by the\r\nticks is in the case of death of nonimmune cattle in the tick-free pastures\r\nof the South. Such animals are as susceptible to Texas fever as nonimmune\r\nnorthern cattle, and inasmuch as there is in many States only one out of\r\nevery four farms infested with ticks, the cattle on the remaining farms\r\nwill in many cases contract Texas fever when exposed to the fever tick.\r\nThese losses can scarcely be computed, as the death rate depends so much on\r\nthe season of the year when exposure occurs and on the age of the animal\r\naffected. However, the deaths among such cattle are considerable, although\r\nthis fact is little appreciated or understood by many outside the infected\r\narea.\r\n\r\nOn rare occasions a small outbreak of Texas fever occurs north of the\r\nquarantine line as a result of improperly disinfected cars, of unscrupulous\r\ndealers breaking the quarantine regulations, or of some accidental\r\ncondition. Such damage, however, is slight, but should be considered in\r\nsumming up the loss occasioned by the fever tick.\r\n\r\nThe advertisement which a breeder obtains and the sales which are made by\r\nhaving his stock in the show ring are usually lost to the cattle raiser in\r\nthe infected area who aspires to display his animals in the North, as they\r\nare barred from most of these exhibitions. On the other hand, the southern\r\nfarmer is not given an opportunity to see and be stimulated by the fine\r\nspecimens of northern cattle which might be shown at southern stock\r\nexhibits, for the reason that the danger of contracting Texas fever is too\r\npatent to warrant such exposure. A heavy expense is incurred by the\r\nGovernment and the States in enforcing the regulations that apply to the\r\nquarantine line.\r\n\r\nAnother loss which is indirectly sustained by the southern cattle industry\r\nthrough increased freight rates is the cost, to the railroad companies, of\r\ncleaning and disinfecting the cars that carry cattle and in providing\r\nseparate pens for them at various places.\r\n\r\nThese statements are sufficient to indicate that the loss to the\r\nquarantined section from the cattle tick is something enormous. Such a\r\nseries of encumbrances as those recorded could be carried by the cattle\r\nindustry of no other section of the country than the South, whose excellent\r\npastures, rich soil, and salubrious climate are the only reasons for its\r\nability to overcome such obstacles in meeting the competition of the West;\r\nand it is the inherent capacity of the South for greatly increasing its\r\nherds and enlarging its pasture lands that makes the actual loss even\r\nsecondary to the potential loss from restrictions necessitated by the\r\npresence of the cattle tick. This potential loss may be described as the\r\ndifference between the value of the cattle industry of the South to-day and\r\nthe extent to which this industry would be increased if farmers and\r\nranchmen were assured that their lands and cattle would not become infested\r\nwith fever ticks. Could this assurance be given, the beneficial effects\r\nwould extend over the entire country, because the market of the northern\r\nbreeder would thereby become greatly extended.\r\n\r\nThese appalling losses and annual sacrifices of the cattle raisers of the\r\ninfected district can be entirely effaced, and this at a small\r\nproportionate cost; for, with enthusiastic stockmen, satisfactory State\r\nlegislation, sufficient money, and a corps of trained inspectors, the\r\ncattle tick may be exterminated, and every dollar expended in this work\r\nwill be returned many times during each succeeding year.\r\n\r\n_The so-called period of incubation._--After the young ticks have attached\r\nthemselves to cattle the fever appears about 10 days thereafter in\r\nmidsummer. When the weather is cool, as in autumn, this period may be a\r\nlittle longer. The actual period of incubation may be shorter, for if blood\r\nfrom a case of Texas fever is injected into the blood vessels of healthy\r\ncattle the fever may appear within five days. When cattle graze upon\r\npastures over which southern cattle have passed, the time when the disease\r\nappears varies within wide limits. When the animals have been put upon\r\npastures immediately after southern cattle have infected them with ticks,\r\nit may take from 30 to 60 days, or even longer, before the disease appears.\r\nThis will be readily understood when we recall the life history of ticks.\r\nThe southern cattle leave only matured ticks which have dropped from them.\r\nThese must lay their eggs and the latter must be hatched before any ticks\r\ncan get upon native cattle. The shortest period is thus not less than 30\r\ndays if we include 10 days for the period of incubation after the young\r\nticks have attached themselves to native cattle. When the infection of\r\npastures with ticks has taken place early in the season, or when it is\r\ncold, the period is much longer, because it takes longer for the eggs to\r\nhatch.\r\n\r\nIf native cattle are placed upon pastures which have been infected with\r\nticks some time before, the disease will appear so much sooner, because the\r\nyoung ticks may be already hatched and attack the cattle at once. It will\r\nbe evident, therefore, that the length of time between the exposure of\r\nnative cattle on infected fields and the appearance of the disease depends\r\non the date of original infection, and on the weather, whether cold or hot.\r\nWhen native cattle are placed upon fields on which young ticks are already\r\npresent, they will show the fever in 13 to 15 days if the season is hot.\r\n\r\nThe fever appears before the ticks have matured. In fact, they are still\r\nsmall enough to be overlooked. In any case very careful search should be\r\nmade for them in those places which they prefer--the thighs, escutcheon,\r\nand udder. After the acute stage of the fever has passed the ticks begin to\r\nswell up and show very plainly. (Pl. XLVI, figs. 6 and 7.)\r\n\r\n_Prevention._--It is generally accepted that if southern cattle are\r\nentirely free from that species of tick known as _Margaropus annulatus_\r\nthey can be allowed to mingle with the most susceptible animals without\r\ndanger. Furthermore, it has been learned from the study of the life history\r\nof the cattle tick and by observation that this tick infests pastures only\r\ntransiently, never permanently, and will not mature except upon cattle or\r\nequines, that its extermination is possible, and that the disease it causes\r\nmay be prevented. Therefore the various methods with these results in view\r\nshould be directed toward the destruction of ticks on cattle as well as\r\ntheir eradication from the pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF ERADICATING THE TICKS.[7]\r\n\r\nIn undertaking measures for eradicating the tick it is evident that the\r\npest may be attacked in two locations, namely, on the pasture and on the\r\ncattle.\r\n\r\nIn freeing pastures the method followed may be either a direct or an\r\nindirect one. The former consists in excluding all cattle, horses, and\r\nmules from pastures until all the ticks have died from starvation. The\r\nlatter consists in permitting the cattle and other animals to continue on\r\nthe infested pasture and treating them at regular intervals with agents\r\ndestructive to ticks and thus preventing engorged females from dropping and\r\nreinfesting the pasture. The larvÊ on the pasture, or those which hatch\r\nfrom eggs laid by females already there, will all eventually meet death.\r\nSuch of these as get upon the cattle from time to time will be destroyed by\r\nthe treatment, while those which fail to find a host will starve in the\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nAnimals may be freed of ticks in two ways. They may be treated with an\r\nagent that will destroy all the ticks present, or they may be rotated at\r\nproper intervals on tick-free fields until all the ticks have dropped. The\r\nmethod most generally used is dipping the cattle in a solution of arsenic.\r\nThe pasture-rotation method is not only more complicated, but the necessary\r\ntick-free fields are seldom available.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPPING.\r\n\r\nThe dipping vat is the best and cheapest means of applying the\r\ntick-destroying solution. The great advantage of dipping over spraying\r\nand applying remedies by hand lies in the fact that thoroughness of the\r\ntreatment is practically assured.\r\n\r\nWhen eradication is undertaken, all the cattle, and also the horses and\r\nmules if they harbor ticks, are treated regularly every two weeks during\r\nthe part of the year that the temperature is favorable to treatment, until\r\nthe ticks have disappeared. The purpose of the treatment is to destroy all\r\nticks that get on the animals before they have had a chance to mature and\r\ndrop, thus preventing them from reinfesting the pasture, farm, or range. If\r\nthe treatment used were absolutely effective in destroying each and every\r\ntick on the animals treated there would be no renewal of the infestation\r\nafter the treatment is begun. The cattle would act simply as collectors of\r\nticks which would be destroyed regularly by the treatment applied every two\r\nweeks. It is probable, however, that in most instances, either because of\r\nthe lack of efficiency of the dip or imperfect application, or because of\r\nfailure to dip all cattle systematically, some ticks escape treatment and\r\nreproduce, thus prolonging the time that otherwise would be required for\r\neradication.\r\n\r\nIf ticks apparently disappear from the cattle after they have been under\r\ntreatment for some time, the dipping should not be discontinued until a\r\nnumber of careful inspections show that the cattle are free of ticks. If\r\nticks continue on cattle until cold weather and then finally disappear it\r\nshould be borne in mind that in all probability eradication has not been\r\naccomplished and that there may be engorged females, unhatched eggs, and\r\ninactive seed ticks on the farm or range, and that even if the cattle\r\nshould remain free of ticks during the winter they may become reinfested\r\nthe following spring. In any case in which ticks disappear from the cattle\r\nand treatment is discontinued, the cattle should be watched very carefully\r\nfor ticks until ample time has elapsed to leave no doubt that eradication\r\nhas been accomplished.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule it has been found that if dipping is begun in March and\r\nsystematically and thoroughly done, all cattle being dipped every 14 days\r\nuntil November, complete eradication will be secured. In dipping, each\r\nanimal should be completely covered by the dip. To prevent any animals from\r\ngoing through the vat without becoming wet all over, a man, provided with a\r\nforked stick, should be stationed at the middle of the vat to shove under\r\nthose that have not been completely submerged.\r\n\r\nDipping is the only really satisfactory method of treating animals for\r\nticks. In cases of emergency, however, or where there are not cattle enough\r\nwithin a radius of several miles to warrant the construction of a vat in\r\nwhich all the cattle of the community may be dipped, spraying may be\r\nadvisable. In spraying animals the work should be done with great\r\nthoroughness and every portion of the body treated. An animal can not be\r\nsprayed properly unless it is tied or otherwise held, nor can good results\r\nbe obtained unless the hair and skin are thoroughly wetted.\r\n\r\n_Preparation and use of arsenical dips._[8]--After experimenting for many\r\nyears to discover a practical method for dipping cattle to destroy ticks\r\nwithout injury to the cattle, the Bureau of Animal Industry has developed a\r\nvery satisfactory arsenical dip. Two formulas are given for homemade dips,\r\none known as the \"S-B\" (self-boiled) and the other as the boiled dip. The\r\nformer is the one usually employed.\r\n\r\n_The S-B dip._--The formula calls for two stock solutions, arsenic stock\r\nand tar stock, which must not be mixed except in the diluted dipping bath.\r\n\r\nArsenic stock requires the following materials ready to hand before\r\nstarting:\r\n                     Pounds.\r\n  Caustic soda            4\r\n  White arsenic          10\r\n  Sal-soda crystals      10\r\n\r\nThere should be also some means for heating the solution in case, as\r\nsometimes happens because of impure materials, lack of skill, or some\r\nunforeseen circumstance, the heat created by mixing the materials should be\r\ninsufficient to dissolve all the arsenic.\r\n\r\nIn a 5-gallon kettle or metal[9] pail place the 4 pounds of caustic soda,\r\nadd 1 gallon of cold water, and stir with a stick until the caustic soda is\r\npractically all dissolved. Without delay begin adding the white arsenic, in\r\nportions of a pound or two at a time, as fast as it can be dissolved\r\nwithout causing the solution to boil, stirring all the time. If the liquid\r\nbegins to boil, stop stirring and let it cool slightly before adding more\r\narsenic. The secret of success is to work the arsenic in fast enough to\r\nkeep the solution very hot--nearly but not quite at the boiling point. The\r\nresult should be a clear solution, except for dirt. If the liquid\r\npersistently remains muddy or milky, it may be because the operation has\r\nbeen conducted so fast that much water has been boiled out and sodium\r\narsenite is beginning to crystallize, so add another gallon of water and\r\nstir. If the solution does not then clear up, the caustic soda must have\r\nbeen very low grade, and the undissolved substance must be arsenic. In that\r\ncase, put the kettle over the fire, heat nearly, but not quite, to boiling,\r\nand stir. As soon as the solution of arsenic is complete, dilute to about 4\r\ngallons, add the sodium carbonate, and stir until dissolved.\r\n\r\n_Cautions._--It is necessary to avoid splashing. Hence never work\r\nhurriedly; stir deliberately and regularly; do not dump in the arsenic and\r\nsal soda, but carefully slide them in from a grocer's scoop held close to\r\nthe side of the pail and to the surface of the liquid. Perform the whole\r\noperation in a well-ventilated place and avoid inhaling steam.\r\n\r\nAfter the solution has become cold add water to make it to exactly 5\r\ngallons,[10] mix well, let settle, and draw off into containers which can\r\nbe tightly corked or otherwise closed. Jugs or demijohns are best, but tin\r\ncans will serve if occasionally inspected for leaks which may occur after a\r\ntime through the action of the solution upon the solder of the can.\r\n\r\nTar stock is prepared thus: In a large metal pail dissolve three-fourths of\r\na pound of caustic soda in 1 quart of water, add 1 gallon of pine tar, and\r\nstir thoroughly with a wooden paddle until the mixture, which at first\r\nlooks streaked and muddy, brightens to a uniform, thick fluid somewhat\r\nresembling molasses. Test it by letting about a teaspoonful drip from the\r\npaddle into a glass of water (a glass fruit jar or a wide-mouth bottle\r\nwill do) and stirring thoroughly with a sliver of wood. It should mix\r\nperfectly with the water. Globules of tar which can be seen by looking at\r\nthe glass from underneath and which can not be blended with the water by\r\nrepeated stirring indicate that more caustic-soda solution is needed. In\r\nthat case make up more caustic-soda solution of the same strength and add\r\nit, not more than a pint at a time, with thorough stirring, until the\r\ndesired effect is produced.\r\n\r\nIf an appropriate glass vessel for making the test is not at hand, take a\r\nlittle of the mixture between the fingers, then dip the fingers under water\r\nand try to rub off the tar. It should leave the fingers perfectly clean\r\nafter a little rubbing with water. If an oily coating remains, more\r\ncaustic-soda solution is needed. Such an extra addition of caustic soda\r\nwill be required only in case of a very low-grade chemical or a very highly\r\nacid tar. The tar stock should be kept in closed containers, such as a pail\r\nwith a friction top.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of S-B arsenic stock or of tar stock made in one operation can\r\nbe varied as desired, provided the above-given proportions of the\r\ningredients are adhered to. But one should attempt to work the S-B formula\r\non a larger scale only after skill and experience have been acquired.\r\n\r\n_The boiled dip_ is less convenient than the S-B dip, but the final\r\ncomposition and effect of dipping baths prepared from the two are the same.\r\n\r\nTo make a 500-gallon bath provide:\r\n\r\n  Sal-soda crystals              24 pounds.\r\n  White arsenic                   8 pounds.\r\n  Pine tar                        1 gallon.\r\n\r\nPut 25 gallons of water into a kettle or tank of from 40 to 50 gallons'\r\ncapacity, heat to boiling, and add the sal soda. When this has dissolved\r\nadd the white arsenic, then boil and stir for 15 minutes or longer, until\r\nthe white arsenic has entirely disappeared. If intended for immediate use\r\ncool to 140∞ F. (by addition of cold water if desired), then pour in the\r\npine tar in a thin stream while constantly and vigorously stirring the\r\nsolution. Immediately empty the liquid into the dipping vat, which has\r\nalready been three-fourths filled with water, and stir thoroughly.\r\n\r\nAll the utensils must be free from greasy or oily matter which would coat\r\nthe arsenic and hinder its solution. The operation of boiling requires\r\nconstant attention to avoid loss by foaming. Hard water may be used, but in\r\nthat case considerable undissolved material, which, however, does not\r\ncontain any arsenic, may be left after boiling.\r\n\r\nFor a stock solution to be kept on hand and used when needed add no tar,\r\nbut after the solution has become cold make it up to 25 gallons, stir well,\r\nlet settle, and draw off into containers which can be well closed. In this\r\ncase the tar stock previously described is also required.\r\n\r\n_Diluting the dip._--First run water into the vat about three-fourths up to\r\nthe dipping line, at which its capacity must be known. If tar stock is to\r\nbe used the necessary amount will be one-third of a gallon for every 100\r\ngallons of vat capacity. Measure it out, mix it with 2 or 3 times its\r\nvolume of water and pour it along the surface of the water in the vat,\r\nstirring a little.\r\n\r\nEvery 100 gallons of standard-strength bath calls for 1-3/5 pounds white\r\narsenic, which quantity is contained in four-fifths of a gallon of S-B\r\nstock or in 5 gallons of boiled stock. From these figures the quantity of\r\narsenic or stock needed to charge the vat may be calculated. Or one may\r\nbase the calculation on the following facts:\r\n\r\n      One pound of white arsenic will make 62-1/2 gallons of bath.\r\n      One gallon of S-B stock will make 125 gallons of bath.\r\n      One gallon of boiled arsenic stock will make 20 gallons of bath.\r\n\r\nAll solutions of arsenic are considerably heavier than water and if\r\ncarelessly put into the vat they may plunge to the bottom and be difficult\r\nto mix. Therefore always pour the arsenic stock or a proprietary dip in a\r\nthin stream evenly along the vat except at the shallow exit end. Another\r\nprecaution to be taken in handling proprietary dips is never to mix them\r\nfirst with small quantities of water, which may \"break\" them. Pour them\r\ndirectly into the water in the vat.\r\n\r\nFinally, add water up to the dipping line and stir well. An excellent way\r\nto stir is by a pail tied to a rope. Sink it at the entrance end of the vat\r\nand haul it along the bottom to the exit. Then raise it, throw it back to\r\nthe entrance end, and haul through again, repeating as many times as\r\nnecessary but always hauling through in the same direction.\r\n\r\nThe standard-strength bath prepared as above contains practically 0.19 per\r\ncent arsenious oxid when fresh. After use oxidation may set in and weaken\r\nit, but it will not need to be strengthened so long as it tests not less\r\nthan 0.175 per cent arsenious oxid.\r\n\r\nTo make up small quantities for spraying, to each 5 gallons of water\r\nmeasured out add first 2 fluid ounces (4 tablespoonfuls) of tar stock, and\r\nthen 5-1/8 fluid ounces of S-B stock or 2-1/8 pints of boiled arsenic\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe standard strength of bath should be adhered to so far as possible\r\nbecause its effectiveness against ticks will effect eradication in the\r\nleast time and with fewest dippings. But if time is not pressing it is\r\nsometimes best to begin with a lower strength, say 0.14 or 0.15 per cent,\r\nand gradually work up to full strength as the cattle become accustomed to\r\nthe treatment. This is certainly a wise method for the individual cattle\r\nowner who is outside the area of cooperative work and who lacks aid and\r\nadvice from experts. Weather conditions also need to be considered. Hot or\r\nmoist weather is more trying to the cattle than cool or dry weather. The\r\nlonger the time needed for the cattle to dry off after dipping, which of\r\ncourse primarily depends on the proportion of moisture in the air, the more\r\nliable they are to show blistering or other injury through the continued\r\nabsorption of arsenic by the skin. The combination of heat and moisture is\r\nparticularly bad, and under such conditions it may be desirable, unless\r\nother conditions prohibit, to use the bath somewhat weaker than standard\r\nstrength. The following table shows the quantities of arsenic and stock\r\nsolutions contained in 100 gallons of bath of different strengths, so that\r\nthe quantities necessary to charge a vat of any size at any strength can be\r\nfound by simple multiplication.\r\n\r\n  _Composition of dipping baths._\r\n\r\n  +-----------+------------------------------+\r\n  |  Actual   |  Per 100 gallons of bath.    |\r\n  | arsenious +------------------------------+\r\n  |  oxid.    |  White   |   S-B   | Boiled  |\r\n  |           | arsenic. |  stock. | stock.  |\r\n  +-----------+----------+---------+---------+\r\n  | Per cent. |  Pounds. | Gallons.| Gallons.|\r\n  |   0.05    |    0.42  |   0.21  |   1.3   |\r\n  |    .06    |     .50  |    .25  |   1.6   |\r\n  |    .07    |     .58  |    .29  |   1.8   |\r\n  |    .08    |     .66  |    .33  |   2.1   |\r\n  |    .09    |     .75  |    .38  |   2.3   |\r\n  |    .10    |     .83  |    .42  |   2.6   |\r\n  |    .11    |     .91  |    .46  |   2.8   |\r\n  |    .12    |    1.00  |    .50  |   3.1   |\r\n  |    .13    |    1.08  |    .54  |   3.4   |\r\n  |    .14    |    1.16  |    .58  |   3.6   |\r\n  |    .15    |    1.25  |    .63  |   3.9   |\r\n  |    .16    |    1.33  |    .67  |   4.2   |\r\n  |    .17    |    1.41  |    .71  |   4.4   |\r\n  |    .18    |    1.49  |    .75  |   4.7   |\r\n  |    .19    |    1.58  |    .79  |   4.9   |\r\n  |    .20    |    1.66  |    .83  |   ...   |\r\n  |    .21    |    1.74  |    .87  |   ...   |\r\n  |    .22    |    1.83  |    .92  |   ...   |\r\n  |    .23    |    1.91  |    .96  |   ...   |\r\n  |    .24    |    2.00  |   1.00  |   ...   |\r\n  +-----------+----------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\nAs dipping goes on the bath naturally needs replenishing, and its strength\r\nprobably needs correction from time to time. Full directions on these\r\npoints may be found in Farmers' Bulletin 1057.\r\n\r\n_Prepared dips._--Proprietary arsenical cattle dips appear now to have\r\npassed the experimental stage and to have become established as reliable\r\nand useful products. At any rate this can be said of the brands which have\r\nreceived permission for use in official dipping in place of the homemade\r\ndip. The formulas and standard samples of all such brands are in possession\r\nof the Bureau of Animal Industry and the manufacturers are required to\r\nguarantee that their products as placed on the market will be kept up to\r\nstandard and that all requirements of the bureau will be observed. Like the\r\nhomemade dip they all contain sodium arsenite as the active tick-killing\r\nagent. They do not all contain pine tar, because that substance is\r\ndifficult to blend into a highly concentrated product, but they all contain\r\nsome other substance or mixture of substances of such character and in such\r\nquantity as field trials have proved will produce the same effects.\r\n\r\nThey are not regarded as any more effective or any milder on the cattle\r\nthan properly prepared homemade dips. None the less they are undoubtedly\r\nsafer for general use because they offer decidedly fewer opportunities for\r\nmaking mistakes in the quantities used or in the operations gone through\r\nand also fewer chances for accidental poisoning or other injury from the\r\nhandling of powerful chemicals. Whether their higher cost is sufficiently\r\noutweighed by these considerations is necessarily a matter for individual\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\n_Precautions in the use of arsenic and arsenical dips._--The fact that\r\narsenic is a violent poison is what renders it valuable, for the fever tick\r\nis hard to kill. But, like a keen-edged tool, it may be decidedly dangerous\r\nif ignorantly or carelessly handled. Three possibilities of danger must be\r\nkept constantly in mind; danger to oneself, danger to other persons, danger\r\nto animals.\r\n\r\nThe dry, powdered white arsenic should be kept in a tightly covered pail,\r\nplainly labeled. Paper bags are unsafe because they easily burst, and\r\narsenic so scattered about looks harmless enough. In weighing or otherwise\r\nhandling the arsenic avoid raising dust or breathing it in, if raised, and\r\nkeep it off the skin and clothing. In mixing or boiling stock solutions\r\nwork only in a well-ventilated place, and on the windward side of the\r\nkettle so that steam arising from it will not be inhaled.\r\n\r\nThe stock solutions are in some respects more dangerous than the original\r\nsubstance because the arsenic in them is already in solution and can act\r\nvery quickly. If any gets on the skin or clothing it must be washed off\r\nwithout delay. Cattle must be kept away from such solutions or from\r\nanything that has been in contact with them, for cattle craving salt have\r\nbeen poisoned by licking the outside of leaky barrels and by licking the\r\nearth around dipping vats where a little concentrate had been carelessly\r\nspilled in charging the vat. All such poisoned earth must be removed,\r\nburied, and replaced by fresh.\r\n\r\nThe diluted bath is naturally much less dangerous, but no chances can be\r\ntaken with it. No puddles from which animals may drink should be allowed to\r\naccumulate. The persons who do the dipping should not allow the skin or\r\nclothing to be wet by the dip any more or any longer than absolutely\r\nnecessary. When spraying, the operator should see to it that neither he nor\r\nthe animals inhale any of the spray.\r\n\r\nWhen a vat is to be emptied the approved practice is to run the waste bath\r\ninto a pit properly guarded by a fence, where it will gradually seep away\r\nunder the surface and do no harm, provided only that seepage can not be\r\ncarried to a well, stream, or spring from which any person or domestic\r\nanimal may drink.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of arsenical poisoning are rather variable and also depend on\r\nthe size of the dose and the method of administration. If an animal sickens\r\nor dies shortly after dipping it by no means follows that arsenical\r\npoisoning or any other effect of the dipping is the cause. Very few cattle\r\nrelative to the total number dipped have suffered undoubted arsenical\r\npoisoning and in most of the cases the cause could be traced to somebody's\r\nerror or carelessness.\r\n\r\nIn regard to arsenical poisoning of human beings there is a standard\r\nantidote, which may be obtained at any drug store with directions for use.\r\nIt should be kept on hand for emergencies. If the antidote is not at hand\r\nthe poison must be removed from the stomach by encouraging repeated\r\nvomiting, and soothing drinks such as milk, white of eggs and water, or\r\nflour and water must be freely given meanwhile. A suspected case of\r\narsenical poisoning must have the attention of a physician at the earliest\r\npossible moment, as sometimes the poison works very quickly.\r\n\r\n_Crude petroleum._--Various kinds of crude petroleum and emulsions of it\r\nhave been used with more or less success in destroying ticks, but on\r\naccount of the difficulty of obtaining suitable grades of oil and the\r\nliability of injury to cattle, their use has been practically abandoned.\r\n\r\n_Method of dipping._--The method usually adopted in dipping cattle is to\r\nconstruct a narrow swimming tank with a chute at one end for the entrance\r\nof the cattle, and a sloping exit at the other end when the cattle emerge\r\nafter passing through the vat. (See Pl. XLIX, fig. 2.) A drip chute, or\r\nfloor, is connected with the exit, where the excess of dip is allowed to\r\ndrip off the animals and to drain into the vat. Plans and specifications\r\nfor installing dipping plants may be obtained from the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry, Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nWhen Texas fever has broken out, all animals, the sick as well as the\r\nhealthy, should at once be removed to a noninfected pasture. While this may\r\nnot cut short the disease, it may save the lives of some by removing them\r\nfrom the possibility of attack by more young ticks. Removal from infected\r\npastures likewise prevents a second attack, in October or early in\r\nNovember, which is caused by another generation of ticks. Sick native\r\ncattle infect with a new generation of ticks the pasture to which they are\r\nremoved, but these usually appear so late that they have but little\r\nopportunity to do any damage; hence, sick natives do not, as a rule, cause\r\nvisible disease in other natives.\r\n\r\nIt is of importance to remove all ticks, so far as this is possible, from\r\nsick animals, since they abstract a considerable quantity of blood and\r\nthereby retard the final recovery.\r\n\r\nMedical treatment of the sick has generally been unsatisfactory, although\r\nin chronic cases and those occurring late in the fall beneficial results\r\nhave followed. If the animal is constipated, a drench containing 1 pound of\r\nEpsom salt dissolved in 1 quart of water should be administered, followed\r\nby sulphate of quinin in doses of 30 to 90 grains, according to the size of\r\nthe animal, four times a day until the system is well saturated with it.\r\nTincture of digitalis one-half ounce and alcohol 2 ounces may be combined\r\nwith the quinin, according to indications of individual cases. An iron\r\ntonic containing reduced iron 2 ounces, powdered gentian 4 ounces, powdered\r\nnux vomica 2 ounces, powdered rhubarb 2 ounces, and potassium nitrate 6\r\nounces will be found beneficial in the convalescent stage when the fever\r\nhas run its course. This tonic should be given in heaping teaspoonful doses\r\nthree times a day in the feed. Good nursing is essential in treating these\r\ncases, and the animal should be given a nutritious, laxative diet with\r\nplenty of clean and cool drinking water and allowed to rest in a quiet\r\nplace. If the stable or pasture is infested with ticks, the animal should\r\nbe placed in a tick-free inclosure to prevent additional infestation with\r\nthese parasites and the introduction of fresh infection into the blood.\r\nFurthermore, all ticks that can be seen should be removed from the sick\r\ncattle, as they keep weakening the animal by withdrawing a considerable\r\nquantity of blood, and thereby retard recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUARANTINE REGULATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary regulations issued by the Department of Agriculture for the\r\ncontrol of cattle shipments from the infected districts have for their\r\ninitial purpose the prevention of the transportation of ticks from infected\r\nregions to those that are not infected, either upon cattle or in stock cars\r\nor other conveyer. They are based upon the fact that Texas fever is carried\r\nnorth only by the cattle tick, and the exclusion of this parasite from the\r\nnoninfected territory has in every instance been found a certain method of\r\nexcluding Texas fever. The regulations governing the movement of cattle\r\nfrom below the quarantine line are made yearly by the Secretary of\r\nAgriculture, and they define the boundary of infected districts. The\r\ninfected area as now determined is shown in maps issued periodically.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the enforcement of these quarantine regulations, Texas\r\nfever has been practically prevented in the noninfected districts for\r\nseveral years, and little or no hardship has been caused to stockmen\r\nhandling cattle from the infected areas. Prior to the adoption of these\r\nregulations the tick-infested district was rapidly extending northward, but\r\nsince the quarantine line was established and rational regulations enforced\r\nit has gradually been moved farther south. This problem of still further\r\nreducing the infested area is of the greatest importance to the cattlemen\r\nof the South--in fact, to those on both sides of the line--and one which is\r\nreceiving special consideration by this department as well as by many of\r\nthe interested States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICK ERADICATION.\r\n\r\nSystematic cooperative work by the Federal Government and the affected\r\nStates for the eradication of the cattle ticks which transmit Texas fever\r\nwas begun in the summer of 1906 under authority given by Congress in the\r\nappropriation act for the Department of Agriculture. The first Federal\r\nappropriation for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1907, was $82,500, and for\r\nthe fiscal year 1908 an appropriation of $150,000 was made, then for\r\nseveral years $250,000, and this has been increased to $660,000 for 1922.\r\nFunds have also been provided by States and counties.\r\n\r\nThe original infected area amounted to 728,543 square miles. Of this\r\nterritory there has been released from quarantine as a result of the work\r\nabove mentioned 523,837 square miles (up to July 1, 1922). In other words,\r\n72 per cent of the area has been freed from ticks in 16 years.\r\n\r\nGreat improvement has resulted from this work in the released territory.\r\nMore cattle are being raised, and a better grade of breeding stock is being\r\nintroduced; calves grow faster, and cattle put on flesh more rapidly during\r\nthe grazing season and go into the winter in better condition because of\r\nthe absence of the ticks; they can be marketed without quarantine\r\nrestrictions, and higher prices are being obtained; dairy cows give a\r\nlarger yield of milk; and values of farm lands are enhanced.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the prices realized for cattle from the\r\ntick-infested region and the prices of cattle of similar grades from above\r\nthe quarantine line has ranged from $2.25 to $5 a head at the principal\r\nnorthern live-stock markets, without taking into account the improvement in\r\nquality and weight of cattle because of the eradication of the ticks. It\r\ncan easily be seen that the extermination of the ticks means a large total\r\nannual increase in the prices obtained for southern cattle sold in northern\r\nmarkets. In addition to this, the increase in prices of cattle sold locally\r\nin the South would represent a large sum. This local increase has been\r\nfound to amount to from $3 to $15 a head in territory freed from ticks. An\r\nagricultural official of one of the Southern States has reported that\r\ncalves in the tick-free area bring double the prices that can be obtained\r\nfor similar calves in the tick-infested region.\r\n\r\nHeretofore it has been impracticable to improve the quality of southern\r\ncattle by introducing fine breeding animals from other sections, because\r\nsuch animals were liable to contract Texas fever and die unless protected\r\nby inoculation. Furthermore, it is impossible for animals to attain good\r\ngrowth and to thrive when they are heavily infested with ticks. With the\r\neradication of the ticks, however, the southern farmers are enabled to\r\nintroduce good breeding animals and to improve the grade of their stock.\r\n\r\nThere is no longer any doubt that it is entirely practicable to exterminate\r\nthe ticks throughout the entire region, and the accomplishment of this\r\nresult will be of tremendous economic advantage not only to the South but\r\nto the whole country. The rate of progress depends mainly on two factors--\r\nthe amounts appropriated by the Federal and State Governments, and the\r\ncooperation of the people.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CATTLE FEVER (TEXAS FEVER, TICK FEVER).\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATES.\r\n\r\nPLATE XLIV.

The disease was first studied\r\nin 1895 by Johne and Frothingham in Dresden, but they were inclined to\r\nattribute to the avian tubercle bacillus the cause of the peculiar lesions\r\nof enteritis which they observed. In 1904 Markus reported this disease in\r\nHolland, and subsequently it was observed in Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark,\r\nand Great Britain.\r\n\r\n_Cause._--The bacillus, which has been invariably demonstrated in the\r\nintestinal lesions and mesenteric lymph glands in this disease, is a rod\r\nabout 2 to 3 microns long and 0.5 micron wide. It stains more or less\r\nirregularly, like the tubercle bacillus, and moreover the similarity goes\r\nfurther, in that the organism is also strongly acid-fast, which facts led\r\nJohne and Frothingham to surmise that the disease was caused by avian\r\ntubercle bacilli. However, it has now been plainly demonstrated that the\r\nbacillus of chronic bacterial dysentery is readily distinguished from the\r\nlatter organisms, for while it resembles the tubercle bacillus in form and\r\nstaining qualities, no one has succeeded in growing it in culture media or\r\nin reproducing the disease by injecting experiment animals.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--Probably the first symptom noticed is that the animal is\r\nlosing condition despite the fact that its appetite is good and the food\r\nnourishing. This is soon followed by a diarrhea which, while moderate at\r\nfirst, soon becomes excessive and may be either irregular or persistent,\r\nthe feces being of the consistency of molasses and passed frequently. In\r\nthe meantime the hair becomes dry and harsh and the animal falls off\r\nconsiderably in weight. The temperature, however, remains about normal. The\r\nappetite does not seem to be greatly impaired until the last few weeks of\r\nlife, but nevertheless emaciation continues, the animal becomes more and\r\nmore anemic, great muscular weakness and exhaustion are manifested, and\r\ndeath follows, apparently as the result of the persistent diarrhea and\r\ngreat emaciation. The disease may continue for four or five weeks or may\r\nlast for a year, or even longer, before death intervenes.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--The lesions observed on post-mortem are remarkably slight and\r\nare out of all proportion to the severity of the symptoms manifested. The\r\ndisease appears to start in the small intestines, especially in the lower\r\nportion, where the lesions are usually the most marked, but it also\r\ninvolves the large intestines, including the rectum. The mucous membrane\r\nmay alone be affected, although usually in the long-standing cases the\r\nsubmucosa is also invaded and the entire intestinal wall is then much\r\nthicker than normal and the tissue infiltrated with an inflammatory\r\nexudate. The mucous membrane or inside lining membrane is markedly wrinkled\r\nor corrugated, showing large, coarse folds with more or less reddening or\r\nhemorrhagic patches or spots on the summits of the ridges, especially\r\nnoticeable in the large intestines. The mesenteric lymph glands are usually\r\nsomewhat enlarged and appear watery on section. The other organs do not\r\nappear to be affected except from the anemia present in the later stages of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\n_Differential diagnosis._--The principal disease with which bacterial\r\ndysentery may be confused is tuberculosis, but the application of the\r\ntuberculin test will readily diagnose the latter disease, while no reaction\r\nwill be noted in case the injected animal is suffering with the former\r\naffection. The disease may also be mistaken for the parasitic affections\r\nresulting from stomach worms (verminous gastritis) and intestinal\r\nparasites, especially uncinariasis, but a microscopic examination of the\r\nfeces is necessary in order to establish definitely the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--As with all other forms of infectious disease, it is\r\nadvisable to separate immediately the diseased and suspected cattle from\r\nthe healthy animals. The feces passed by the former animals should be\r\nplaced on cultivated soil where healthy cattle will not be exposed to them,\r\nas the bacilli producing the disease are readily found in such manure. The\r\nstalls, stables, and barnyards should also be thoroughly disinfected, as\r\nhas been described under \"Tuberculosis,\" in this chapter, special attention\r\nbeing given to those places which have been soiled by feces. The\r\nadministration of medicines has thus far been quite unsatisfactory,\r\nalthough treatment should be directed toward disinfecting the intestines\r\nwith intestinal antiseptics, such as tannopin in 1 dram doses twice daily,\r\nand strengthening the animal by the use of stimulants such as strychnin in\r\nhalf-grain doses given twice daily hypodermically. Salol, turpentine, or\r\nsubnitrate of bismuth in a starch or wheat-flour gruel may also give\r\ntemporary relief, but the diarrhea is likely to reappear and cause the\r\ndeath of the animal. In all cases the feed must be carefully selected to\r\nassure good quality, and should consist preferably of nutritious dry feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAGANA.\r\n\r\nNagana, also called tsetse-fly disease, is an infectious fever occurring\r\nchiefly in horses and cattle, characterized by alternating paroxysms and\r\nintermissions and produced by a specific flagellate protozoan (_Trypanosoma\r\nbrucei_) in the blood. It is probably transmitted from animal to animal\r\nsolely by the bites of the tsetse fly. This insect is something like a\r\nlarge house fly, and when it settles on a diseased animal, sucks the blood\r\nand infects its proboscis, it is enabled on biting a second animal to\r\ninfect the latter by direct inoculation. This disease is found throughout a\r\nlarge portion of central and southern Africa, along the low-lying and\r\nswampy valleys. It has never occurred in the United States, nor is it known\r\nto be present in the Philippines, but its relation to surra and the\r\npossibility of its appearance in one of our island dependencies are the\r\nreasons for including a few remarks at this time.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms._--The chief symptoms in addition to the fever, which is usually\r\nabout 104∞ to 105∞ F., are the muscular wasting, progressive anemia, and\r\nloss of power, together with the edema most marked about the head, legs,\r\nabdomen, and genital organs. The urine is yellow and turbid, and\r\noccasionally contains albumin and blood. There is paralysis of one or both\r\nof the hind legs, difficult urination and defecation, labored breathing,\r\ndischarge from the eyes and nose, extreme thirst, and gradual extension of\r\nparalysis to other parts of the body. The disease runs a chronic course,\r\nlasting from three to six weeks in horses, and from one to six months in\r\ncattle. Besides these animals, the mule, ass, buffalo, antelope, hyena,\r\ncamel, and dog contract the disease naturally, and sheep, goats, cats, and\r\nsmall laboratory animals succumb to artificial inoculation.\r\n\r\n_Lesions._--The spleen and lymphatic glands are enlarged. There are\r\nsero-fibrinous exudates in the body cavities, the liver is enlarged and\r\nengorged, heart flabby, and a catarrhal condition is present in the\r\nrespiratory passages. Pathological changes occur in the spinal cord. The\r\nfinding of the trypanosoma by microscopic examination of the blood will\r\nbe conclusive evidence for diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment has not proved satisfactory. Quinin, arsenic,\r\nmethylene blue, and other drugs have been used, but without success.\r\nEndeavors thus far made to produce immunity from this disease have likewise\r\nbeen unavailing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE FARCY.\r\n\r\nThis is a chronic disease of cattle occurring in France and the island of\r\nGuadeloupe, West Indies. It is characterized by caseating nodular\r\nswellings, first of the skin and afterwards of the superficial lymphatic\r\nvessels and glands, finally proving fatal within a year by extension to the\r\nviscera. The swellings rupture and discharge a purulent yellowish fluid,\r\nwhich contains the causative organism. This affection, called farcin du\r\nboeuf by the French, resembles cutaneous glanders or farcy of horses, but\r\nis caused by an entirely different organism, the streptothrix of Nocard.\r\nMoreover, cattle are immune from glanders, and for this reason the name,\r\nunfortunately applied to this disease, should not lead to any confusion\r\nwith the cutaneous glanders or farcy of horses. Although the disease has\r\nbeen described as occurring only in Guadeloupe and France, the possibility\r\nof its occurrence in American possessions warrants its mention in this\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Treatment consists in making incisions into the swellings and\r\nsyringing them out with 2 per cent compound cresol solution. The cavities\r\nmay then be packed with cotton, soaked in 5 per cent zinc-chlorid solution.\r\nThe swollen lymphatics may also be bathed or covered with cloths wrung out\r\nin this solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES.\r\n\r\nThe following are also infectious diseases of cattle, a discussion of which\r\nwill be found in previous chapters:\r\n                                         Page.\r\n  Contagious abortion                     167\r\n  White scour of calves                   261\r\n  Infectious ophthalmia (pink eye)        345\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[4] These membranes comprise the smooth, very delicate, glistening lining\r\nof the large body cavities. In the thorax the serous membrane (pleura)\r\ncovers the ribs and diaphragm as well as the whole lung surface. In the\r\nabdomen a similar membrane (peritoneum) lines the interior of the cavity\r\nand covers the bowels, liver, spleen, etc.\r\n\r\n[5] Hogs are subject to actinomycosis.\r\n\r\n[6] The distribution of Government blackleg vaccine was discontinued July\r\n1, 1922.\r\n\r\n[7] Only a general outline of methods of eradication will be given here.\r\nFor detailed information, including directions for the construction of\r\ndipping vats and for the preparation of dips, the reader is referred to\r\nFarmers' Bulletin 1057, which may be obtained free upon application to the\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n[8] For fuller information see Farmers' Bulletin 1057, from which the\r\ndirections here given are mainly derived.\r\n\r\n[9] The chemicals employed have no effect upon iron. They will, however,\r\nactively corrode zinc, tin, or solder; hence a soldered pail must be\r\nwatched for leaks and is far inferior to a seamless pail, stamped from a\r\nsingle sheet of iron. A tinned pail is preferred to a galvanized one, but a\r\nplain iron seamless pail or an iron kettle should be obtained if possible.\r\n\r\n[10] Best done by previously determining by measurement the depth of 5\r\ngallons of water in the kettle.

D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief of Zoological Division, Bureau of Animal Industry._\r\n\r\nThe animal parasites of cattle comprise more than a hundred different\r\nspecies, belonging to various groups of the animal kingdom. Fortunately not\r\nall these parasites occur in this country--many are uncommon, and many are\r\ncomparatively harmless. Some forms, however, occur frequently, and some are\r\nof distinct importance to the American stockman on account of the damage\r\nfor which they are responsible. It is these parasites particularly which\r\nwill be referred to in the present article, and although some forms are\r\ndiscussed which are rare or apparently of little economic importance, most\r\nof the minor and unusual parasites and species not found in this country\r\nhave been omitted from consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLIES.[11]\r\n\r\nOf the various species of flies which infest cattle some are injurious on\r\naccount of the annoyance, pain, and loss of blood due to their bites, and\r\nsometimes also on account of diseases or parasites which are thus\r\ntransmitted from the blood of diseased animals to that of healthy cattle,\r\nwhile others, which in the winged adult state do not bite, are injurious\r\nbecause they live parasitic on cattle during their larval stages.\r\n\r\n_Remedies for flies._[12]--Most remedies used for protecting cattle from\r\nthe attacks of flies have to be applied frequently, and few, if any, will\r\nkeep flies away for more than a day or two following their application. The\r\nnumerous proprietary fly repellents to be found on the market are usually\r\nmore expensive, and often less efficacious than homemade mixtures.\r\n\r\nAt the Minnesota experiment station rancid lard 1 pound and kerosene\r\none-half pint, mixed thoroughly until a creamy mass forms, was found to\r\ngive excellent results as a fly repellent, lasting for two or three days,\r\nwhen rubbed not too thickly with a cloth or with the bare hand over the\r\nbacks of cows. Mixtures of cottonseed oil and pine tar containing from 10\r\nto 50 per cent of the latter substance were found by investigations in the\r\nBureau of Animal Industry to have a marked repellent action against flies\r\nwhen applied lightly every day. A too free application of tar mixtures and\r\nother preparations containing phenols is liable to cause poisoning; hence\r\ncare should be observed in this regard.\r\n\r\nJensen (1909) recommends the following formula, which is said to protect\r\ncows for a week:\r\n\r\n  Common laundry soap      1 pound.\r\n  Water                    4 gallons.\r\n  Crude petroleum          1 gallon.\r\n  Powdered naphthalin      4 ounces.\r\n\r\nCut the soap into thin shavings and dissolve in water by the aid of heat;\r\ndissolve the naphthalin in the crude oil, mix the two solutions, put them\r\ninto an old dasher churn, and mix thoroughly for 15 minutes. The mixture\r\nshould be applied once or twice a week with a brush. It must be stirred\r\nwell before being used.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STABLE FLY (STOMOXYS CALCITRANS).[13]\r\n\r\nThis fly very closely resembles the house fly, but, unlike the latter, it\r\nis a biting fly. It is common about stables and often enters dwellings,\r\nespecially in cloudy weather. According to NoÈ, it is the agent of\r\ntransmission of a parasitic roundworm of cattle\r\n(_Setaria labiato-papillosa_, see p. 529). This fly has been shown capable\r\nof transmitting anthrax from diseased to healthy animals, and under some\r\nconditions it may transmit surra, a disease caused by a blood parasite\r\nwhich affects horses, cattle, and other livestock.\r\n\r\nThe annoyance suffered by cattle and horses from stable flies is much\r\nlessened if the stables are darkened.\r\n\r\nThe screening of doors and windows, however, is preferable, as ventilation\r\nis not interfered with as it is in darkening stables. For milk cows\r\ncoverings made from burlap (double thickness), including trouserlike\r\ncoverings for the legs, may be used when the flies are very numerous and\r\ntroublesome. One of the fly repellents mentioned above may be applied to\r\ncattle to protect them from stable flies. The Hodge flytrap fitted to the\r\nwindows of dairy barns is a useful means of destroying stable flies. The\r\nUnited States Bureau of Entomology has found that a mixture of fish oil (1\r\ngallon), oil of pine tar (2 ounces), oil of pennyroyal (2 ounces), and\r\nkerosene (1/2 pint) is fairly effective for a short time when applied\r\nlightly, but thoroughly, to the portions of animals not covered with\r\nblankets. The risk of poisoning with tar mixtures as already mentioned\r\nshould be borne in mind in using this remedy. Care should be taken to apply\r\nit lightly.\r\n\r\nThe stable fly breeds in moist accumulations of straw, chaff, cow or horse\r\nmanure, and various fermenting vegetable substances. The dÈbris collecting\r\nin and under outdoor feed troughs, and the remains of straw stacks are\r\nfavorable breeding places for the stable fly. Under the most favorable\r\nconditions about three weeks are required for development from the egg to\r\nthe adult stage.\r\n\r\nThe proper care of straw and the proper disposal of stable manure are very\r\nnecessary in the control of stable flies. Straw stacks should be carefully\r\nbuilt so as to shed rain, and loose straw or chaff should be scattered or\r\nburned. Straw not required for winter feed should be promptly disposed of\r\nby burning or scattering and plowing it under. Stable manure should be\r\nhauled out and scattered at regular intervals, preferably every three days,\r\nand the vicinity of stables should be kept free from accumulations of straw\r\nand hay that may become wet and serve as breeding places for the stable\r\nfly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HORNFLY (LYPEROSIA IRRITANS).[14]\r\n\r\nThis fly, now found nearly everywhere in the United States, was introduced\r\ninto this country from Europe about the year 1885. Hornflies have the habit\r\nof clustering about the base of the horn (fig. 2), whence the name by which\r\nthey are popularly known. They do not damage the horn, and congregate there\r\nonly to rest.\r\n\r\nIn view of the general practice of dehorning cattle, the name hornfly is\r\nless distinctive than it once was. Moreover, hornflies rest on other parts\r\nof the body as well as the horns.\r\n\r\nWhen resting, their wings are held down close to the body (fig. 1); when\r\nfeeding, their wings are held out nearly at right angles, ready for flight.\r\nThey puncture the skin and suck blood, usually attacking the upper parts of\r\nthe body, particularly those which are out of reach of the animal's head or\r\ntail. Unlike most flies, they remain on the animal more or less constantly,\r\nday and night. Owing probably to the irritation and annoyance caused by\r\nthese flies, cattle often do not thrive as they should during seasons when\r\nthe flies are numerous. The hornfly has also been charged with transmitting\r\ndiseases, such as anthrax.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE XLIV.

FACSIMILE OF POSTER USED IN TICK ERADICATION\r\n                            WORK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fly lays its eggs in freshly dropped cow manure. They hatch in about 24\r\nhours, and the larvÊ or maggots in four or five days develop to the pupal\r\nstage, which lasts a week or 10 days. From the pupal stage the mature fly\r\nemerges. The entire process of development from the deposition of the egg\r\nto the appearance of the mature fly therefore may be completed in two\r\nweeks, or even in a shorter time. To protect cattle from attacks of the\r\nhornfly they may be treated with one of the remedies mentioned above (p.\r\n502). Dipping cattle in a vat provided with splashboards set at the proper\r\nangle destroys most of the hornflies present on the animals. Unless the\r\nsplashboards are used all but a few of the flies succeed in escaping as the\r\ncattle plunge into the bath and later return to them. Scattering the\r\ndroppings of cattle with a shovel, or with brush dragged over pastures, in\r\norder to insure the rapid drying of the manure and consequent destruction\r\nof the larvÊ, is, when practicable, an efficient means of reducing the\r\nnumber of these flies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1.--Hornfly (_Lyperosia irritans_) in resting\r\n  position. Enlarged. (From Bureau of Entomology.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2.--Hornflies (_Lyperosia irritans_) on cow\r\n  horn. (From Bureau of Entomology.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nBUFFALO GNATS.\r\n\r\nThese small flies, also known as black flies, are about one-eighth of an\r\ninch long and have a characteristic \"humped\" back (fig. 3). They breed in\r\nrunning water and appear in swarms during spring and summer, often in\r\nenormous numbers, causing great annoyance to stock and human beings, on\r\naccount of their bites and their entrance into the eyes, nose, mouth, and\r\nother openings of the body. Their bites appear to be poisonous, and in\r\nseasons especially favorable to the gnats heavy losses of horses and cattle\r\noften occur.\r\n\r\nBuffalo gnats are more troublesome in bright, sunny weather than when it is\r\ncloudy, and animals which have not shed their winter coats suffer more from\r\ntheir attacks than those with smooth coats. Cattle kept in darkened stables\r\nare not molested. The application of one of the fly repellents already\r\nmentioned (p. 502) may help to protect animals from buffalo gnats. The\r\nburning of smudges is also a useful means of protecting stock from the\r\nattacks of these flies.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3.--Buffalo gnat. Enlarged. (From Bureau of\r\n                            Entomology.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREW WORMS.[15]\r\n\r\nScrew worms (fig. 4) are the maggots of a fly (_Chrysomyia macellaria_), so\r\ncalled from their fancied resemblance to a screw. The adult fly (fig. 5) is\r\nabout one-third of an inch long, with a bluish-green body, red eyes, and\r\nwith three dark longitudinal stripes on the back (thorax). Attracted by\r\nodors of decay, it deposits its eggs, 300 to 400 at a time, in cuts, sores,\r\ncastration wounds, etc. The crushing of a tick on the skin commonly results\r\nin screw-worm infection at that point. The eggs hatch in a few hours and\r\nthe larvÊ or maggots, or so-called screw worms, begin to burrow into the\r\nflesh and continue burrowing and feeding from three to six days, after\r\nwhich they leave the wound and crawl into the earth, there transforming\r\ninto the quiescent pupal stage. This stage is completed in three to\r\nfourteen days. The mature flies then emerge from the pupal envelope and are\r\nsoon ready for egg laying. From two to three weeks are therefore required\r\nfor the entire life cycle, although under certain conditions it is possible\r\nfor the fly to undergo its full development in as short a time as seven\r\ndays, and on the other hand as long as a month is often required.\r\n\r\nBesides cattle, the screw-worm fly attacks sheep, horses, dogs, and man. In\r\nthe case of hogs it is generally the ears which are affected. The fly also\r\nbreeds in dead animals, and all carcasses should therefore be buried deeply\r\nor burned. The complete destruction of all dead animals by burning has been\r\nfound by the Bureau of Entomology to be by far the best method of\r\ncontrolling screw worms.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for screw worms._--For proper treatment an animal suffering from\r\nscrew worms should be caught and thrown. Chloroform is then poured into the\r\nwound, taking care that it penetrates thoroughly into all the burrows of\r\nthe screw worm, if necessary using a slender stick or a small bunch of\r\ntwisted hay as a probe. The animal should be held for several minutes in\r\norder to insure the continued action of chloroform. Instead of chloroform,\r\ngasoline may be used, and carbon tetrachlorid is said by some authorities\r\nto give good results. Finally, the dead or dying maggots may be removed\r\nwith forceps, the wound washed with a weak carbolic or cresylic acid\r\nsolution, and painted with pine tar to reduce the chances of further attack\r\nby flies. Finally the wound should be dressed with a carbolic or cresylic\r\nointment to promote healing and thus prevent further infection, or the\r\nwound may be painted with pine tar. Dipping in the arsenical dips used for\r\ndestroying cattle ticks is a convenient method of treatment if many animals\r\nare involved.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4.--Screw worm (larva of _Chrysomyia\r\n  macellaria_).

(From Bureau of Entomology.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nGRUBS, WARBLES, BOTS.\r\n\r\nOx warbles are whitish or, when full grown, dark-colored grubs or maggots\r\nthat develop from the eggs deposited on the hairs of cattle by certain\r\nflies known as warble flies. In the United States there are two species of\r\nox-warble flies, technically known as _Hypoderma lineatum_ and _Hypoderma\r\nbovis._ These flies somewhat resemble bees in their general appearance, but\r\nlike all flies have only two wings.\r\n\r\nThe first named, _H. lineatum_, is commonly called the heel fly and is more\r\ngenerally distributed over the United States than the other species. The\r\ntail has a distinctive reddish-orange color and the legs are rough and\r\nhairy. This fly commonly deposits its eggs about the coronet, whence the\r\nname of heel fly, and on the fetlocks, knees, and hocks. When cattle are\r\nresting, eggs are deposited along the line of contact of the body with the\r\nsoil. Cattle are frequently indifferent to the activity of this fly in\r\ndepositing its eggs. Commonly 8 to 10 eggs, sometimes as many as 14, are\r\nattached to a single hair.\r\n\r\nIn the United States the other warble fly, _H. bovis_, has been found only\r\nin the North (New England, New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Michigan,\r\nIowa, Missouri, and Washington) and has not yet been found in the Southern\r\nStates. The tail is orange-yellow, lighter in color than that of the other\r\nspecies, and the legs have but few hairs. This fly commonly deposits its\r\neggs on the outside of the hind quarters and above the fetlocks when the\r\nanimals are moving, or lower down if they are quiet. Cattle are usually\r\nmuch disturbed by the activity of this fly and not infrequently appear\r\nterror stricken. The eggs are attached singly, one egg to a hair near its\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the warble flies hatch as a rule in about a week, the time\r\nvarying with local conditions. The young warble is about 1 mm. (1/25 inch)\r\nlong. It crawls to the base of the hair and burrows into the hair follicle.\r\nThe entrance of the larvÊ frequently causes sudden appearance of swellings.\r\nThe larvÊ of _H. bovis_ in entering the skin rarely cause a flow of serum\r\nor pus formation, but those of _H. lineatum_ commonly cause a considerable\r\nflow of serum with pus formation resulting in a matting of the hair on\r\naffected areas of the skin. The warbles after penetrating the skin migrate\r\nthrough the body and ultimately reach the backs of the cattle, _H.\r\nlineatum_ usually appearing there in northern latitudes about the middle of\r\nDecember and _H. bovis_ about a month later. During their migrations,\r\nbefore they reach the back, the young warbles spend a considerable period\r\nin the walls of the esophagus, or gullet, and may be found in this location\r\nas early as August 15. During the fall and winter a large proportion of the\r\ngullets of cattle that are slaughtered are found to be infested with\r\nwarbles, and are known as grubby gullets or weasands in the packing houses.\r\n\r\nWhen the warbles first appear in the back they are about 3/5 inch long.\r\nThey cause swellings about the size of pigeons' eggs, each swelling having\r\na small hole in the center, which has been punctured in the skin by the\r\nwarble to enable it to breathe. Through this hole the warble leaves the\r\nback of the cow when it has completed its parasitic stage of development,\r\nat which time it measures nearly an inch in length.\r\n\r\nThe full-grown larvÊ begin to leave the backs of the cattle early in the\r\nyear, and in northern latitudes the last leave before the middle of July.\r\nAfter leaving the backs of the cattle they burrow into the ground, lie\r\nquiescent for about a month, and become transformed into mature flies. In\r\nnorthern latitudes the mature flies of the species _H. lineatum_ may be\r\nobserved during April and May, and those of the other species during June\r\nand July.\r\n\r\nThe damage caused by warbles includes injury to stampeding cattle\r\nfrightened by the fly, decreased milk flow and diminished growth in\r\ninfested animals, and injury to hides, the last item being especially\r\nserious.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The best method of control known at present is to extract the\r\nwarbles from the backs of cattle and kill them. If they are almost ready to\r\nleave the cattle, they may be squeezed from the backs with the fingers.\r\nForceps are useful in removing the warbles, but it is important to be\r\ncareful in extracting warbles not to crush them, as the body juices of\r\nthese parasites are sometimes poisonous to cattle if absorbed into their\r\ncirculation. In the South herds may be examined in November or early in\r\nDecember and once a month during the next two or three months. In the North\r\nthe first examination may be made six weeks to two months later, with two\r\nor, better, three following examinations at intervals of a month. If this\r\nprocedure is carefully carried out there will be a noticeable diminution of\r\nwarbles the following year, and if persisted in the warble can be almost if\r\nnot completely eradicated. Where an entire community follows up the\r\npractice of removing and destroying warbles, the results are highly\r\nbeneficial.\r\n\r\nAs a result of recent studies by various investigators it appears that the\r\ntiny grubs, newly hatched from the eggs, may gain entrance to the body by\r\npenetrating directly through the skin. Many observers, however, have held\r\nthat the eggs or newly hatched larvÊ are taken into the mouth by the cattle\r\nlicking themselves. It is possible, as in the case of several other\r\nparasites, that both modes of infection may occur and that the larvÊ may\r\ngain entrance to the body either by penetrating the skin or by being\r\nswallowed. From the evidence at present available it seems likely that the\r\nusual mode of entrance is through the skin. Irrespective of the mode of\r\ninfection, the larvÊ evidently wander extensively through the tissues of\r\nthe body, developmental stages being found in considerable numbers in the\r\nwall of the esophagus during the fall of the year. They have also been\r\nfound in the spinal canal and in various other locations. Finally, about\r\nJanuary they appear beneath the skin of the back, forming the well-known\r\nswellings. The posterior end of the grub is near the small opening in the\r\nhide, through which the grub breathes and discharges its excrement, and\r\nthrough which, when its development is complete, it finally escapes. The\r\nanterior end of the grub is at the bottom of the tumor, where the mucus\r\ncollects upon which it feeds. By spring or early summer the grub is full\r\ngrown and forces its way out of the skin, falling to the ground, into which\r\nit burrows for a short distance and transforms into the pupal stage. In\r\nabout a month the mature fly emerges.\r\n\r\nIt has lately been discovered that a second species of warble fly\r\n(_Hypoderma bovis_) common in Europe is of not uncommon occurrence in\r\nCanada and the northern part of the United States, whereas it was formerly\r\nsupposed that the ox warbles of this country were all of the one kind. The\r\ngeneral appearance, life history, and effects of the European species are\r\nmuch the same as those of the American form.\r\n\r\nGrubs weaken cattle, cause them to fall off in flesh and milk, and decrease\r\nthe value of the hide. The beef in the immediate vicinity of a grub becomes\r\nslimy and of a greenish color, and is known to the butchers as \"licked\r\nbeef.\"\r\n\r\nThe total loss to this country on account of the warble fly is estimated at\r\n$35,000,000 to $50,000,000 a year, at the least, and may amount to\r\nconsiderably more.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for warbles._--During the winter and spring examine the cattle\r\nfor the presence of warbles. By passing the hand over the backs of the\r\nanimals the swellings marking the location of the grubs may be readily\r\nfound. Pressure properly applied to the swellings will cause the grubs to\r\n\"pop out\" if they have reached a late stage of development. They may be\r\nmore easily removed by means of slender forceps inserted into the opening\r\nof the warbles, and a still more certain method of removing them,\r\nparticularly if the lumps are still very small, is to cut into the\r\nswellings with a sharp knife or bistoury, after which they may be pressed\r\nout. Care should be taken to crush all grubs removed, so as to prevent the\r\npossibility of their further development and transformation into flies. In\r\norder that none may escape it is advisable to examine the cattle every two\r\nweeks during the late winter and spring, at each examination removing the\r\ngrubs which have developed sufficiently to cause perceptible swellings.\r\n\r\nAnother method of treatment is to force grease or oil into the openings of\r\nthe warbles, which kills the grubs. This method is less certain than that\r\nof removing the grubs, and has the further objection that the dead grubs\r\nremain beneath the skin.\r\n\r\nCattle may be treated during the summer with fly repellents (p. 502) to\r\nkeep off the warble flies. The efficacy of repellents against these flies\r\nis probably, however, not very great.\r\n\r\nIn localities where the character of the cattle industry is such as to\r\nrender practicable the systematic examination of cattle and the removal of\r\nthe grubs--that is, where the herds are comparatively small and subject to\r\nthe close supervision of the owners--it is possible, by the exercise of a\r\nlittle care and with very little effort on the part of the cattle owners,\r\nprovided they work together, each doing his share by seeing to the removal\r\nof grubs from his own cattle, so that as few as possible survive to\r\ntransform into flies, to reduce the number of grubs within one or two\r\nseasons almost, if not entirely, to the point of extinction.\r\n\r\nInvestigations not yet completed indicate that grub eradication may\r\nsometimes be accomplished by the use of arsenical dips, which are\r\nextensively used at the present time for destroying cattle ticks. (See p.\r\n497.) It is possible that the destructive action of arsenical dips upon\r\nwarbles is more or less dependent upon the fact that arsenic is stored up\r\nin small quantities in and upon the skin of cattle that are repeatedly\r\ndipped in arsenical dips. The arsenical dip appears to act, not upon the\r\nwell-developed grub beneath the skin, but upon the eggs or the newly\r\nhatched larvÊ, probably the latter. Accordingly the dipping of cattle to\r\ndestroy grubs should be carried out during the fly season and repeated\r\ntreatments should be given every two or three weeks, as in dipping cattle\r\nto eradicate ticks.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6.--The warble fly (_Hypoderma lineatum_): _a_,\r\n   adult female; _b_, eggs attached to a hair, ◊ 25; _c_, larva as seen\r\n   in egg; _d_, larva from esophagus of an ox; _e_, later stage of larva\r\n   from beneath the skin of the back; _f_, larva at the stage when it\r\n   leaves the back of cattle and falls to the ground--all enlarged\r\n   (after Riley).]\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE.[16]\r\n\r\nCattle in the United States are commonly infested with three species of\r\nlice, two of them sucking lice (_HÊmatopinus eurysternus_, the short-nosed\r\ncattle louse, and _Linognathus vituli_, the long-nosed cattle louse),\r\ncommonly known as blue lice, and one biting louse (_Trichodectes\r\nscalaris_), commonly known as the red louse.\r\n\r\nThe blue lice (figs. 7 and 8) suck the blood of cattle and are more\r\ninjurious than the red lice (fig. 9). Unless very abundant the latter cause\r\nlittle injury. If numerous they irritate and worry their host probably more\r\nby their sharp claws than by their bites, as their food seems to consist\r\nentirely of particles of hair and dead skin.\r\n\r\nCattle lice reproduce by means of eggs or nits (fig. 10) which they fasten\r\nto the hair. The blue lice infest chiefly the neck and shoulders; red lice,\r\nwhen present, may be found almost anywhere on the body, but are usually\r\nmost numerous on neck, shoulders, and at the root of the tail.\r\n\r\nOn account of the itching caused by the lice, infested cattle rub against\r\nposts, trees, etc., and lick themselves, the hair sometimes coming out and\r\nthe skin becoming thickened so that mange may be suspected.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for lice._--Cattle may be treated for lice by means of hand\r\napplications, spraying, or dipping. Dusting powders sold under various\r\ntrade names are of value in helping to hold lice in check when the weather\r\nis too cold for dipping or spraying. The application of greases and\r\ninsecticidal liquids by hand is fairly effective and practicable in cases\r\nin which there are only a few animals to be treated. The following remedies\r\nhave proved effective when applied by hand, the treatment being repeated if\r\nnecessary in about 16 days: (1) Cottonseed oil and kerosene, equal parts;\r\n(2) kerosene, 1/2 pint, mixed with lard, 1 pound; (3) crude petroleum; (4)\r\nany of the dips recommended for use in dipping, and diluted in the same\r\nproportions as for dipping. Oils or greases should not be used in very warm\r\nor very cold weather. The remedies mentioned may be applied with a brush or\r\na cloth. They should be distributed in a thin, even coating over the\r\nsurface of the body, taking care that there is no excess quantity at any\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nIn spraying, any of the dips recommended for lice, properly diluted, are\r\napplied by means of a spray pump over the entire body. Thorough wetting of\r\nthe skin and hair is important, and a second treatment should be given 15\r\nor 16 days later.\r\n\r\nWhen a considerable number of animals are to be treated the most\r\nsatisfactory method of destroying lice is by the use of a dipping vat. Two\r\ndippings should be given 15 or 16 days apart. Dipping in the fall is good\r\ninsurance against risk of loss from lice during the winter. All animals in\r\nthe herd should be treated regardless of the number showing infestation.\r\nEither coal-tar-creosote or nicotin dips may be used. These are sold under\r\nvarious trade names. The directions for dilution given by the manufacturer\r\nshould be carefully followed. As coal-tar-creosote dips do not mix well\r\nwith all kinds of water, they should be tested with the water to be used\r\nfor making the solution by mixing some of the dip in the proper proportions\r\nwith the water in a clean and clear-glass bottle or jar. If an oily layer\r\nor mass of globules collects either at the top or the bottom of the mixture\r\nafter standing an hour, the dip is not suitable for use with that kind of\r\nwater. Imperfectly mixed coal-tar-creosote dips are liable to poison\r\nanimals even when not used in stronger solutions than that recommended by\r\nthe manufacturers, and are also likely to be inefficacious.\r\n\r\nThe lime-sulphur dip, which is highly efficacious as a mange remedy, is of\r\nlittle value for destroying lice, especially blue lice. The arsenical dip\r\nused in tick eradication is a good louse remedy, but its use is not\r\nadvisable on account of its poisonous nature, except under the supervision\r\nof capable persons who know how to use it and what precautions to take.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7.--Short-nosed blue louse (_HÊmatopinus\r\n  eurysternus_) of cattle.

(From\r\n     Bureau of Entomology.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nMANGE, ITCH, SCAB.[17]\r\n\r\nCattle are subject to four kinds of mange, of which common mange or\r\npsoroptic mange is the most important.\r\n\r\n\r\nPSOROPTIC MANGE.\r\n\r\nPsoroptic mange of cattle is caused by small mites (fig. 11) which multiply\r\nrapidly and are spread from diseased to healthy cattle by bodily contact,\r\nor by pens, stables, railroad cars, etc., recently occupied by mangy\r\ncattle. The mites attack the skin and cause it to become thickened and\r\ncovered with crusts and scabs, with a consequent loss of hair. Intense\r\nitching accompanies the disease, and affected cattle are more or less\r\nconstantly rubbing and licking themselves. Psoroptic mange commences at the\r\nroot of the tail, or on the neck, or withers, and gradually extends over\r\nthe back up to the head, over the sides, and may finally affect nearly the\r\nentire body except the legs. In serious cases the skin may become\r\nulcerated; the animals are greatly weakened and emaciated, and finally die.\r\nBy taking scrapings from the edges of scabby patches and placing them on a\r\npiece of black paper in a warm place the mites may be seen as tiny white\r\nobjects crawling over the paper, more distinctly if a magnifying glass is\r\nused. Mange may be confused with lousiness, ringworm, or with any condition\r\nin which there is itching or loss of hair, but if mites are found there is\r\nno question of the diagnosis. The disease is worse during cold, wet\r\nweather. Mangy cattle when on good pasture during the summer often seem to\r\nrecover, but in the fall the disease again appears in a severe form.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--The most generally used and most satisfactory method of\r\ntreating cattle mange consists in dipping the animals in a vat filled with\r\na liquid of such nature that it will kill the parasites without injuring\r\nthe cattle. Vats for dipping cattle are built of wood, stone, or concrete,\r\nand vary in length from 30 to 100 feet or more. They vary in width from 3\r\nto 7 feet at the top and 1-1/2 to 3 feet at the bottom, and the depth may\r\nbe from 7 to 10 feet. A narrow chute through which the cattle are driven\r\nleads to one end of the vat, where a steep slide pitches the cattle into\r\nthe dipping fluid, through which they swim, and climb out of the vat at the\r\nother end, which is built sloping and provided with cross cleats to give\r\nthe animals a foothold. A draining pen with floor sloping back toward the\r\nvat is generally provided. The dip should be used warm, 100∞ to 105∞ F.,\r\nand the cattle should be held in the vat for two minutes to insure thorough\r\naction of the dip. The head of each animal should be ducked at least once.\r\nCare should be taken that the vat contains a sufficient depth of fluid to\r\nswim the animals to be dipped. The dipping fluid may be heated from a steam\r\nboiler by pipes or hose, or water heated in large iron cauldrons or tanks\r\nmay be used for charging the vat, and hot water with a proper quantity of\r\ndip added from time to time as the dipping fluid becomes cool.\r\n\r\nIf crude-petroleum dips are used, one dipping is usually sufficient, and\r\nthe dip is used cold. Crude-petroleum dips are rarely used for common\r\nmange, but are of special value for sarcoptic mange, which is cured with\r\ndifficulty by the ordinary dips. In the treatment of ordinary mange with\r\nlime-sulphur or nicotin dips two dippings are necessary, the second dipping\r\nbeing given 10 to 14 days after the first. The second treatment is\r\nnecessary to kill the few parasites which sometimes escape at the first\r\ntreatment, either in the egg stage or as fecundated females.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11.--Mite which causes psoroptic scab of sheep.\r\n  Enlarged about 100 times. The mite of psoroptic cattle mange is almost\r\n  identical in appearance.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLIME-SULPHUR DIP.\r\n\r\nThe lime-sulphur dip is made in the proportion of 12 pounds of unslaked\r\nlime (or 16 pounds of commercial hydrated lime--not air-slaked lime), 24\r\npounds of flowers of sulphur, and 100 gallons of water.\r\n\r\n_Directions for preparing 100 gallons of dip._--Weigh out the lime, 12\r\npounds (or hydrated lime, 16 pounds), and sulphur, 24 pounds. Place the\r\nunslaked lime in a shallow, water-tight box similar to a mortar box, or\r\nsome other suitable vessel, and add water enough to slake the lime and form\r\na lime paste or lime putty. Sift into this paste the flowers of sulphur and\r\nstir well; then place the lime-sulphur paste in a kettle, boiler, or tank\r\ncontaining 30 gallons of water, the water being first heated nearly to the\r\nboiling point. Boil the mixture for two hours at least, stirring\r\nfrequently; add water occasionally to maintain the original quantity. Allow\r\nthe mixture to settle in the tank or draw the entire contents of the kettle\r\nor boiling tank into a large tub or barrel placed near the dipping vat and\r\nprovided with a bunghole about 4 inches from the bottom, and then allow\r\nample time to settle--from two to three hours or more if necessary. When\r\nfully settled, draw off the clear liquid into the dipping vat, taking care\r\nnot to allow any of the sediment to accompany it, as the sediment is liable\r\nto render the dip unnecessarily caustic. The clear liquid thus obtained\r\nrequires only the addition of sufficient clear warm water to bring the\r\ntotal up to 100 gallons. Flowers of sulphur must be used and the lime must\r\nbe of good quality.\r\n\r\nThe dipping bath should be used at a temperature of 100∞ to 105∞ F., and\r\nfor official dippings must be maintained at all times at a strength of not\r\nless than 2 per cent of \"sulphid sulphur\" as indicated by the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry field test for lime-sulphur baths.\r\n\r\n\r\nNICOTIN DIP.\r\n\r\nThe nicotin dip is made with sufficient extract of tobacco, or nicotin\r\nsolution, to give a mixture containing not less than five one-hundredths of\r\n1 per cent nicotin and 2 per cent flowers of sulphur. Sufficient nicotin\r\nwould therefore be furnished for 96 gallons (about 800 pounds) of dip by 1\r\npound of a 40 per cent solution of nicotin. The formula for this dip would\r\nbe: Nicotin, four-tenths of a pound; flowers of sulphur, 16 pounds; water,\r\n96 gallons.\r\n\r\nTo calculate how much nicotin solution or extract of tobacco should be used\r\nfor 96 gallons of water, divide the quantity of nicotin required in the dip\r\nby the proportion of nicotin in the extract. For example, suppose the\r\nnicotin solution contains 25 per cent nicotin, we have 0.40 ˜ 0.25 = 1.6.\r\nTherefore in this case it would require 1.6 pounds of nicotin solution for\r\nthe 96 gallons of dip. Or, if a tobacco extract is used, having, for\r\nexample, 2.4 per cent of nicotin, the formula would be as follows: 0.40 ˜\r\n0.024 = 16.66, and therefore 16.66 pounds would be required for 96 gallons\r\nof dip. Do not use any preparation the strength of which is not given on\r\nthe outside of the package.\r\n\r\nIn preparing these dips the nicotin solution and sulphur should be mixed\r\ntogether with water before adding them to the water in the dipping vat. On\r\nno account should the dip be heated above 110∞ F. after the nicotin\r\nsolution is added, as heat is liable to evaporate the nicotin and weaken\r\nthe dip.\r\n\r\nFor official dippings the dipping bath should be used at a temperature of\r\n100∞ to 105∞ F. and at all times must be maintained at a strength of not\r\nless than five one-hundredths of 1 per cent nicotin as indicated by a field\r\ntest approved by the Bureau of Animal Industry.\r\n\r\nA homemade nicotin dip may be prepared as follows:\r\n\r\nFor each 100 gallons of dip desired, take 21 pounds of good, prepared\r\ntobacco leaves; soak the leaves in cold or lukewarm water for 24 hours in a\r\ncovered pot or kettle; then bring the water to near the boiling point for a\r\nmoment, and, if in the morning, allow the infusion to draw for an hour; if\r\nin the evening, allow it to draw overnight; the liquid is next strained\r\n(pressure being used to extract as much nicotin as possible from the wet\r\nleaves) and diluted to 100 gallons per 21 pounds of tobacco. This dip\r\nshould be used as fresh as possible, as it contains a large amount of\r\norganic material which will soon decompose.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUDE-PETROLEUM DIPS.\r\n\r\nCrude-petroleum dips, which are valuable for the treatment of sarcoptic\r\nmange, are not often used for the treatment of psoroptic mange or of\r\nchorioptic mange, oily dips being liable to injure animals, especially if\r\nthey are moved rapidly soon after treatment, if they are exposed to bright\r\nsunshine, or if they become chilled. Besides unprocessed crude petroleum,\r\nprocessed petroleum from which the gasoline and other light hydrocarbons\r\nhave been removed may be utilized in the treatment of cattle for mange,\r\nparticularly sarcoptic mange. There are a number of proprietary brands of\r\ncrude-petroleum dips on the market, consisting of processed crude petroleum\r\nwith other substances added, mainly lighter oils to give the dip a suitable\r\nconsistency. In dipping cattle in crude-petroleum dips fill the vat with\r\nwater to within 1 foot or 18 inches of the dip line and then add the oil\r\nuntil the surface is flush with the dip line. The oil floats on the water,\r\nand as the animals pass through the vat their bodies become coated with\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHORIOPTIC MANGE.\r\n\r\nChorioptic mange, due to a species of mite different from that causing\r\ncommon cattle mange, is confined almost entirely to the region at the root\r\nof the tail and if not treated may persist for years. The treatment is the\r\nsame as for psoroptic mange.\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCOPTIC MANGE.\r\n\r\nSarcoptic mange, frequently called \"barn itch,\" is caused by a mite very\r\nsimilar to that which causes itch in human beings. It commonly affects the\r\nhead and neck, but may also occur on various other parts of the body. Bulls\r\nare particularly liable to be affected with this form of mange. Cattle may\r\nbecome infected not only from other cattle, but also from horses, goats,\r\ndogs, sheep, and hogs. As a rule sarcoptic mange in any species of animal,\r\nif acquired from an animal of another species, is likely to run a short\r\ncourse and tend toward a spontaneous recovery.\r\n\r\nThe treatment likely to be most efficacious is that of dipping in a\r\ncrude-petroleum dip, one treatment as a rule being sufficient. If\r\nlime-sulphur dip is used, four or five successive treatments, or even\r\nmore, at weekly intervals, may be necessary before a cure is effected.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEMODECTIC MANGE.\r\n\r\nDemodectic mange, which is caused by a small parasite that lives in the\r\nhair follicles, causing pustules, especially on the neck and shoulders,\r\noccurs occasionally among cattle in this country and is of importance on\r\naccount of the injury to the hide. When tanned, hides infested by this\r\nparasite are pitted, the pits, in some cases, being so deep that they form\r\nholes. No practicable treatment is known for this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKS.[18]\r\n\r\nAbout 10 species of ticks have been reported as parasites of cattle in the\r\nUnited States. The most common and most important is the species known as\r\n_Margaropus annulatus_, which transmits Texas fever. Information concerning\r\nthis tick and Texas fever has been given elsewhere in this volume (p. 475).\r\n\r\nThe spinose ear tick (_Ornithodoros megnini_) is frequently found in the\r\nears of cattle in the western part of the United States, and is of common\r\noccurrence also in the ears of horses, dogs, cats, etc.\r\n\r\nWhen its parasitic stage of development is completed the ear tick leaves\r\nits host. Mating between the sexes occurs after the ticks have cast their\r\nskins following the abandonment of their host. They usually crawl up some\r\ndistance from the ground and secrete themselves in cracks and crevices in\r\ntrees, walls of buildings, etc., where the females deposit their eggs.\r\n\r\nAfter the eggs hatch, the larval ticks, which emerge from them, when they\r\nsucceed in finding a host, enter the ears and gradually develop to the\r\nstage at which they are ready to leave the host animal. The females may\r\nlive several months, or even years, if they do not find mates. After mating\r\nthey may deposit their eggs intermittently. Hatching of the eggs may occur\r\nas early as 10 days after deposition. The larvÊ may live for 80 days\r\nwithout a host. The parasitic period has been observed to vary from about\r\ntwo to about seven months.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--On account of their habits and great vitality and their\r\noccurrence in various kinds of animals besides cattle, complete eradication\r\nis a difficult problem. The only effective treatment known is to introduce\r\ndirectly into the ear passages a remedy that will kill the ticks. Later, of\r\ncourse, the cattle may become reinfested from exposure to infested ranges\r\nor inclosures. The following mixture, however, in addition to killing the\r\nticks in the ears, will protect against reinfestation for about 30 days:\r\nOrdinary commercial pine tar, two parts; cottonseed oil, one part--in each\r\ncase by volume. Animals to be treated are confined in a chute, and the\r\nmixture is injected into the ears with a syringe, after the wax and other\r\ndÈbris in the ears have been cleaned out with a wire probe that has an\r\neyelet at one end. Further information concerning ear ticks and the details\r\nof their treatment is given in Farmers' Bulletin 980.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLOODSUCKERS OR LEECHES.\r\n\r\nThese worms are sometimes taken up by cattle when drinking from ponds. They\r\nmay attach themselves to the inner surface of the mouth or nose, and\r\nsometimes reach the upper part of the windpipe or of the gullet. Bleeding\r\nat the mouth or nose may be noticed, the membranes where the leech is\r\nattached are liable to be swollen and congested, and as a result of the\r\nloss of blood a condition of anemia may result.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--If the worm can be reached it may be destroyed by cutting it\r\nin two with a pair of scissors, or it may be removed with forceps or with\r\nthe fingers after wrapping a towel around the hand so that the worm can be\r\nheld without slipping. Fumigation with tobacco or tar may cause the worm to\r\nrelease its hold if it can not be removed by other means. Ponds may be rid\r\nof infestation with bloodsuckers by the introduction of eels.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES OF THE STOMACH.\r\n\r\nThe stomach of cattle consists of four compartments, of which the first and\r\nfourth are most likely to be the seat of parasitic infestation. The first\r\nstomach, or paunch, contains large numbers of minute parasites known as\r\nprotozoa, which are too small to be seen with the naked eye. These small\r\norganisms apparently are in no way injurious. A species of fluke\r\n(_Paramphistomum cervi_ or a closely related species) is occasionally found\r\nin North American cattle, especially grass-fed cattle, attached to the\r\ninner surface of the first stomach (fig. 12). This worm is about one-half\r\ninch long, and somewhat conical in shape; hence the name, conical fluke, by\r\nwhich it is sometimes known. Although this parasite has been accused of\r\nproducing serious effects, it is generally considered harmless.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of roundworms may occur in the fourth stomach. Two of these\r\nare of special importance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.--Portion of the wall of the first stomach with\r\n  conical flukes attached.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWISTED STOMACH WORM (H∆MONCHUS CONTORTUS).\r\n\r\nThe twisted stomach worm (_HÊmonchus contortus_, figs. 13, 14, 15) is\r\nsometimes found in enormous numbers in the fourth stomach of cattle. Sheep,\r\ngoats, and other ruminants may also be infested with it. Among the symptoms\r\ncaused by this parasite may be mentioned anemia, loss of flesh, general\r\nweakness, dullness, capricious appetite, excessive thirst, and diarrhea.\r\nThe anemic condition is seen in the paleness of the skin and mucous\r\nmembranes of the mouth and eye, and in the watery swellings which often\r\ndevelop under the lower jaw (\"poverty jaw\"). If the fourth stomach of a\r\ndead animal is cut open and the contents carefully examined, the parasites,\r\nwhich are from 1/2 inch to 1-1/4 inches in length and about as thick as an\r\nordinary pin, may be seen, if present in any considerable number, actively\r\nwriggling about like little snakes.\r\n\r\nCattle become infected with these parasites by grazing on pastures on which\r\ninfested cattle, sheep, or goats have grazed and scattered their droppings.\r\nThe worms in the stomach produce a multitude of eggs (fig. 14_c_) of\r\nmicroscopic size, which pass out of the body in the feces. In warm weather\r\nthese eggs hatch in a few hours. If the temperature is below 40∞ F., they\r\nremain dormant, and if below freezing, they soon die. The eggs are also\r\nkilled by dryness; moisture, on the other hand, favoring their development.\r\nThe larvÊ which hatch from the eggs are microscopic in size, and, like the\r\neggs, are, at first and until they have developed to a certain stage, very\r\nsusceptible to freezing and drying. In very warm weather the larvÊ complete\r\ntheir development, so far as they are able to develop outside the body, in\r\ntwo or three days. In cooler weather the time required for this development\r\nis longer, and at temperatures below 70∞ F. 10 days to several weeks may be\r\nnecessary. The larvÊ are then ready to be taken into the body. The eggs and\r\nearly stages of the larvÊ apparently do not develop if swallowed, and only\r\nthe completed larval stage seems to be infectious. In this stage the larvÊ\r\nmigrate up grass stalks (fig. 15) or other objects, showing activity\r\nwhenever the air is saturated with moisture; that is, during rains, fogs,\r\nand dews. When the air becomes dry and the moisture evaporates from the\r\ngrass the young worms cease their activity, resuming their migrations when\r\nthe air again becomes overladen with moisture. LarvÊ which have developed\r\nto the infectious stage, unlike the eggs and early larval stages, are able\r\nto survive long periods of freezing and dryness. In two weeks to a month\r\nafter the embryos are swallowed they reach maturity and begin producing\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n_Preventive treatment._--Preventive measures are important. As moisture\r\nfavors the development of the embryos, high sloping ground is preferable\r\nfor pastures. If low ground is used, it should be properly drained. The\r\npasture should not be overstocked. Burning over the pasture will destroy\r\nmost of the young worms on the grass and on the ground, and this means of\r\ndisinfection under certain circumstances may be very advantageously used.\r\nThe herd should be changed to fresh pasture as often as possible. Cattle\r\nshould be supplied with water from wells, springs, or flowing streams,\r\npreferably in tanks or troughs raised above the ground. To a slight degree\r\nsalt serves to protect cattle against infection with internal parasites,\r\nand plenty of it should therefore be kept accessible.\r\n\r\nAffected animals should be isolated from the rest of the herd in hospital\r\npens or pastures. A plentiful supply of nourishing feed is an important\r\nfactor in enabling cattle to withstand the attacks of stomach worms and\r\nother intestinal parasites. The stabling of cattle, with the maintenance of\r\nclean and sanitary surroundings and liberal feeding, will often stop losses\r\nfrom internal parasites, even though no medicinal treatment is given.\r\n\r\n_Medicinal treatment._--In dosing animals for stomach worms it is advisable\r\nto treat not only the animals which are seriously affected, but the rest of\r\nthe herd as well, since the parasites with which they are infested will\r\nremain as a source of reinfection to the others. The cattle should be\r\nremoved to fresh pasture after treatment, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe animals to be treated should be deprived of feed for 12 to 16, or even\r\n24, hours before they are dosed, and if the bluestone treatment is used\r\nshould receive no water on the day they are dosed until several hours after\r\ndosing. In drenching, a long-necked bottle or a drenching tube may be used.\r\nIn case the former is used the dose to be given may be first measured off,\r\npoured into the bottle, and the point marked on the outside with a file, so\r\nthat subsequent doses may be measured in the bottle itself. A simple form\r\nof drenching tube (fig. 16) consists of a piece of rubber tubing about 3\r\nfeet long and one-half inch in diameter, with an ordinary tin funnel\r\ninserted in one end and a piece of brass or iron tubing 4 to 6 inches long,\r\nof suitable diameter, inserted in the other end. In use the metal tube is\r\nplaced in the animal's mouth between the back teeth, and the dose is poured\r\ninto the funnel, which is either held by an assistant or fastened to a\r\npost. The flow of liquid through the tube is controlled by pinching the\r\nrubber tubing near the point of union with the metal tube. It is important\r\nnot to raise the animal's head too high on account of the danger of the\r\ndose entering the lungs. The nose should not be raised higher than the\r\nlevel of the eyes. The animal may be dosed either standing on all fours or\r\nlying on the side.\r\n\r\nThe position on all fours is preferred by some authorities, who believe\r\nthat more of the remedy is likely to reach the fourth stomach when the\r\nanimal is dosed standing than when dosed in other positions.\r\n\r\nGreat care should be used in dosing to prevent the entrance of the liquid\r\ninto the lungs, and in the preparation and administration of the remedy to\r\navoid getting the solution too strong or the dose too large.\r\n\r\nBluestone, or copper sulphate, has been extensively used in South Africa in\r\nthe treatment of sheep and cattle for stomach worms and is recommended by\r\nthe colonial veterinary surgeon of the Cape Colony as the best and safest\r\nremedy. To prepare the solution take 1 pound (avoirdupois) of pure\r\nbluestone, powder it fine, and dissolve in 9-1/2 gallons of warm water. It\r\nis better first to dissolve the bluestone in 2 or 3 quarts of boiling\r\nwater, then add the remaining quantity of cold water, and mix thoroughly.\r\nThis solution may be given to cattle in the following-sized doses:\r\n\r\n  Calves                3-1/2 to 4 fluid ounces.\r\n  Yearlings                      6 fluid ounces.\r\n  Two-year-olds and over  12 to 16 fluid ounces.\r\n\r\nIn making up the solution only clear blue crystals of bluestone should be\r\nused. Bluestone with white patches or crusts should be rejected. It is\r\nespecially important that the bluestone and water be accurately weighed and\r\nmeasured, and that the size of the dose be graduated according to the age\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nThe special value of medicated salts advertised under various trade names\r\nas preventives against worms is problematical. Commonly they contain little\r\nelse than ordinary salt, the other substances being in such small quantity\r\nthat their therapeutic effect is practically negligible. Definite evidence\r\nthat they are more efficacious than plain salt is not yet available and\r\ntheir use is not recommended.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13.--Twisted stomach worms (_HÊmonchus contortus_).\r\n  Outlines showing natural size of male (above) and female.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14.--Twisted stomach worms (_HÊmonchus contortus_).\r\n  Male (_a_), female (_b_), and egg (_c_).

Enlarged.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16.--A drenching tube made from an ordinary tin\r\n   funnel, a piece of rubber hose, and a piece of brass pipe.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENCYSTED STOMACH WORM (OSTERTAGIA OSTERTAGI).\r\n\r\nThis parasite is as thick as a fine hair and less than half an inch in\r\nlength. It lives in small cysts in the wall of the fourth stomach (fig. 17)\r\nand is also found free in the cavity of the stomach. When numerous, these\r\nparasites cause a thickening of the stomach wall and disturb its digestive\r\nfunctions. The symptoms caused by this parasite are very similar to those\r\nproduced by the twisted stomach worm. The life history of the encysted\r\nstomach worm is not known in detail, but it is undoubtedly very much the\r\nsame as that of the twisted stomach worm. The same measures as recommended\r\nabove for preventing infection with the twisted stomach worm should be\r\nused. Medicinal treatment would seem to be of little use, owing to the\r\nprotected position in which the parasite occurs.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17.--Piece of lining of fourth stomach, showing\r\n   cysts of the encysted stomach worm (_Ostertagia ostertagi_).]\r\n\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL PARASITES.\r\n\r\nTAPEWORMS.\r\n\r\nTwo species of tapeworms (fig. 18) are known to occur in the small\r\nintestine of American cattle. They sometimes grow to a length of several\r\nyards and to a breadth of three-fourths of an inch. Small portions of\r\ntapeworms, consisting of one or more segments, are occasionally seen in the\r\ndroppings of infested cattle. The life history is not known, but the\r\ninfectious stage is undoubtedly taken in with the feed or water, infection\r\nbeing spread by the eggs of the parasite contained in the feces of infested\r\nanimals. The eggs are perhaps swallowed by some small creature (an insect,\r\nworm, or snail) which acts as an intermediate host, and which when\r\naccidentally swallowed by a cow while grazing or drinking carries with it\r\ninto her stomach the infectious stage of the tapeworm.\r\n\r\nAdult cattle do not seem to suffer much from infestation with tapeworms,\r\nbut in calves these parasites may cause scouring and emaciation.\r\n\r\n_Treatment._--Medicinal treatment for tapeworms in cattle is usually\r\nunsatisfactory, but the bluestone treatment used for stomach worms and\r\nmentioned above (p. 522) sometimes expels tapeworms. Arsenic in doses of\r\n1-1/2 to 3 grains has been claimed to give good results in the treatment of\r\ncalves for tapeworms. From results obtained at the Oklahoma Experiment\r\nStation in the treatment of tapeworms of sheep it would appear that the\r\nefficacy of the bluestone treatment against these parasites may be\r\nincreased by the addition of tobacco. For use on cattle the bluestone and\r\ntobacco mixture may be prepared as follows: 13 ounces of snuff or powdered\r\ntobacco is soaked over night in about 8 gallons of water. To this decoction\r\nis added 1 pound of copper sulphate which has been dissolved in 2 or 3\r\nquarts of boiling water. Sufficient water is then added to the mixture to\r\nmake a total of 9-1/2 gallons. The doses of this solution are the same as\r\nfor the simple copper sulphate solution, described on page 522, namely:\r\n\r\n  Calves                 3-1/2 to 4 fluid ounces.\r\n  Yearlings                       6 fluid ounces.\r\n  Two-year-olds and over   12 to 16 fluid ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18.--A tapeworm (_Moniezia planissima_) which\r\n   infests cattle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nROUNDWORMS.\r\n\r\nA large roundworm (_Ascaris vitulorum_) measuring 6 to 12 inches in length,\r\nsometimes found in the intestines of cattle, especially calves, may cause\r\ninflammation and occasionally rupture of the intestine. Infection occurs\r\nthrough the swallowing of the eggs of the parasite in feed or water which\r\nhas been contaminated with the feces of infested cattle.\r\n\r\nA number of species of small roundworms, varying in size from an eighth of\r\nan inch to an inch or more in length, occur in the intestines. Of these may\r\nbe mentioned the hookworm (_Bunostomum phlebotomum_) and the nodular worm\r\n(_[OE]sophagostomum radiatum_). The former is about an inch long and is found\r\nin the small intestine. The latter is somewhat smaller and is found in the\r\ncecum and large intestine. Hookworms, when numerous, may cause anemia and\r\nother symptoms similar to those caused by stomach worms (see p. 519). The\r\ninjury to the mucous lining of the intestine from the bites of hookworms\r\nmay cause severe inflammation, and affords an avenue of infection with the\r\ngerms of various diseases. The adult nodular worms apparently do not attack\r\nthe wall of the intestine, but derive their nourishment from the intestinal\r\ncontents. Several species of small, very slender roundworms\r\n(_Trichostrongylus_), less than a quarter of an inch in length, sometimes\r\noccur in the small intestine and fourth stomach, and a severe\r\ngastroenteritis, or inflammation of the stomach and intestines, has been\r\nattributed to them. One species of small roundworm (_Cooperia punctata_)\r\nburrows in the wall of the small intestine and causes caseous nodules in\r\nthe mucous lining. This parasite sometimes occurs in very large numbers in\r\nthe intestines of cattle in certain sections of the country, and apparently\r\ndoes considerable damage.\r\n\r\n_Nodular disease_ of the intestine, due to young nodular worms which burrow\r\nin the intestinal wall during a certain stage in their life history,\r\nsometimes apparently produces serious effects, particularly in young\r\ncattle, but commonly has little or no perceptible influence on the general\r\nhealth. It, however, often renders the intestine unfit for use as sausage\r\ncasings, and as it is widely prevalent among cattle the loss from this\r\nsource is considerable. The greenish or yellowish nodules with cheesy\r\ncontents are frequently mistaken by the inexperienced for lesions of\r\ntuberculosis.\r\n\r\nThe life histories of the various small roundworms occurring in the\r\nintestines of cattle, so far as they have been worked out, are very similar\r\nto that of the twisted stomach worm as described on page 519.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for intestinal roundworms._--The preventive measures are similar\r\nto those recommended in the case of the twisted stomach worm (p. 521).\r\nMedical treatment is generally not very satisfactory. According to the\r\nOklahoma Experiment Station, the addition of 1 per cent of tobacco to the\r\nbluestone solution used in the treatment of stomach worms in sheep is\r\neffective in the removal of hookworms. The bluestone and tobacco mixture\r\ndescribed on page 524 may be of value in the treatment of hookworms in\r\ncattle. It is asserted by one author that 2 or 3 drams of rectified\r\nempyreumatic oil in a mucilaginous emulsion, followed the next morning with\r\na purgative of 1 to 1-1/2 pounds of sulphate of soda, will expel the large\r\nroundworms (_Ascaris vitulorum_).\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTOZOA.\r\n\r\nA number of species of protozoa have been reported as parasites of the\r\nintestines of cattle. To one species has been attributed a serious disease\r\nof cattle in Switzerland known as red dysentery, but so far comparatively\r\nfew cases of this disease have been recorded in America. It is probably\r\nmore common than is generally supposed. Calves particularly seem most\r\nlikely to be affected.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLUKES IN LIVER AND LUNGS.\r\n\r\nTwo species of flukes occurring in the liver and lungs are known to affect\r\ncattle in the United States. These parasites are flat, leaf-like worms;\r\none of them, the common liver fluke (_Fasciola hepatica_, fig. 19), is less\r\nthan an inch in length, while the other, the large American fluke\r\n(_Fasciola magna_, fig. 20), is considerably larger when full grown. In\r\ntheir life history these flukes depend on snails as intermediate hosts. At\r\na certain stage of development the young flukes leave the snails, become\r\nencysted on stalks of grass (fig. 21), or fall into drinking water, and\r\nfinally may be swallowed by cattle. Stiles writes as follows:\r\n\r\n  Flukes may produce a serious, often fatal, disease, more especially in\r\n  younger animals. The symptoms are somewhat similar to those produced by\r\n  worms in the stomach. The first symptoms are generally overlooked, the\r\n  disease not attracting attention until the appetite is diminished;\r\n  rumination becomes irregular, the animals become hidebound, and the coat\r\n  dull and staring. The staring coat is due to the contraction of the\r\n  muscles of the hair follicles. The visible mucous membranes become pale,\r\n  eyes become dull, there is running at the eyes, and the animal gradually\r\n  becomes emaciated. As the disease advances the milk supply is lessened,\r\n  fever appears, there is generally great thirst, but the appetite almost\r\n  ceases; edematous swellings appear on the belly, breast, etc.; diarrhea\r\n  at first alternates with constipation, but finally becomes continuous.\r\n  The disease lasts from two to five months, when the most extreme cases\r\n  succumb.\r\n\r\n  Most of the German cattle are said to be infested with liver flukes, but\r\n  even when a large number are present the nourishment of the cattle is\r\n  not disturbed. Thickening of the gall ducts, so that a so-called\r\n  \"Medusa's head\" forms on the surface of the liver toward the stomach,\r\n  appears in even well-nourished animals; even in cases of a cirrhosis of\r\n  the liver it is seldom that any effect upon the cattle's health can be\r\n  noticed, and so long as a portion of the liver tissue about twice the\r\n  size of the fist remains intact, the nourishment of the animal may be\r\n  comparatively good. It is rare that one sees a generalized edema in\r\n  slaughtered cattle as a result of fluke invasion, and even in the\r\n  heaviest infections of young cattle only emaciation is noticed.\r\n\r\n  _Treatment._--Medicinal treatment is unsatisfactory. The disease may be\r\n  prevented to a considerable extent by giving animals plenty of salt,\r\n  and by introducing carp, frogs, and toads into infected districts;\r\n  these animals destroy the young stages of the parasite and feed upon\r\n  the snails which serve as intermediate hosts.\r\n\r\nThe drainage of wet pastures and the avoidance of swampy lands for grazing\r\npurposes are important measures in the prevention of fluke diseases.\r\n\r\nRailliet and others have recently recommended the application of lime to\r\nfluky pastures, having discovered that very weak solutions are destructive\r\nnot only to fluke embryos but to snails. This application is to be made\r\nduring the summer months at the rate of about 500 to 1,000 pounds of lime\r\nper acre. The same authors also recommend extract of male fern for the\r\ntreatment of fluke disease. Moussu states that the average dose for cattle\r\nis 1 gram of the extract for each 10 kilograms of live weight; that is, 10\r\ngrams for a young animal weighing 100 kilograms (about 220 pounds) up to\r\n50 grams as a maximum for large animals weighing 500 kilograms (about\r\n1,100 pounds) or more. The extract is mixed with about 5 times as much\r\nnon-purgative oil and the dose is administered each morning for five\r\nconsecutive days two hours before the animal is allowed to feed after\r\nhaving been fasted over night. The extract of male fern used should have a\r\nguaranteed strength of 22 to 25 per cent of filicine and 3.5 per cent of\r\nfilicic acid.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19.--The common liver fluke (_Fasciola hepatica_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20.--The large American fluke (_Fasciola magna_).]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21.--Portion of grass stalk bearing three encysted\r\n  cercariÊ of the common liver fluke (_Fasciola hepatica_). Enlarged.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPEWORM CYSTS OF LIVER AND OTHER VISCERA.\r\n\r\nThree kinds of tapeworm cysts are found in the viscera of cattle. One of\r\nthese (_Multiceps multiceps_, or _C[oe]nurus cerebralis_) will be further\r\nreferred to in the discussion of gid (p. 528). All these are the\r\nintermediate stages of tapeworms, which live when mature in the intestines\r\nof dogs, wolves, and other canines. The eggs of the tapeworms are scattered\r\nover the fields in the droppings of infested dogs or wolves, and when\r\nswallowed in food or water by cattle hatch out and the embryos migrate to\r\nthe liver, mesentery, lungs, brain, or other organs, where they develop\r\ninto cysts, variously known as hydatids, bladder worms, water balls, etc.\r\nWhen organs of cattle thus infested are eaten by dogs or wolves the cystic\r\nworms are also liable to be swallowed and then develop into mature\r\ntapeworms. To prevent cattle from infection with these parasites stray\r\ndogs, wolves, and coyotes should be killed wherever found, and dogs too\r\nvaluable to kill should be kept free from tapeworms. As a precaution\r\nagainst infection with tapeworms, the viscera of cattle, sheep, or hogs\r\nshould not be fed to dogs unless cooked.\r\n\r\nHYDATIDS (_Echinococcus granulosus_) form tumors (fig. 22) of varying size\r\n(sometimes as large as 6 inches in diameter) in the liver, lungs, and other\r\norgans. Their contents are liquid, resembling water. The presence of these\r\nparasites can not be detected in the living animal and there is no\r\nmedicinal treatment for them. Organs containing hydatids should be\r\ndestroyed by burning in order to prevent their being eaten by dogs. This is\r\nespecially important, as dogs infested with the tapeworm stage of this\r\nparasite are a menace to human beings on account of the danger of infecting\r\nthem with hydatids, which develop in man if the eggs of the hydatid\r\ntapeworm are swallowed.\r\n\r\nTHIN-NECKED BLADDER WORMS (_TÊnia hydatigena_, fig. 23) are most commonly\r\nfound attached to the mesentery and omentum. There is no medicinal\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nGID.--Bladder worms (_Multiceps multiceps_, or _C[oe]nurus cerebralis_),\r\nwhich are occasionally found in the brain of cattle and cause gid,\r\n\"turnsick,\" or \"staggers,\" deserve mention, as they are rather common among\r\nsheep in the Northwest. As already alluded to, these worms are the\r\nintermediate stage of a tapeworm found in dogs, and their life history and\r\nthe means of preventing infection have been briefly discussed above (see p.\r\n527).\r\n\r\nCattle harboring this parasite show symptoms indicating an affection of the\r\nbrain, walking or turning in circles, dizziness, uneven gait, impaired\r\nvision, etc.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in trephining the skull and removing the parasite, an\r\noperation which requires a skillful operator and is frequently\r\nunsuccessful. Unless the parasite is removed affected cattle almost\r\ninvariably die.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22.--Hydatids (_Echinococcus granulosus_) in portion\r\n                             of hog's liver.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 23.--Thin-necked bladder worm (TÊnia hydatigena)\r\n                             from abdominal cavity of a steer.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTAPEWORM CYSTS IN THE MUSCLES, BEEF MEASLES.[19]\r\n\r\nSmall tapeworm cysts (_TÊnia saginatÊ_), about the size of a pea, found in\r\nthe muscles of cattle are the larvÊ of the common tapeworm of man. Cattle\r\nbecome infected from feed or water which has been contaminated by the feces\r\nof persons harboring the adult tapeworms, and human beings in turn become\r\ninfected by eating raw or rare beef infested with the larval stage (measly\r\nbeef).\r\n\r\nTo prevent cattle from becoming infested with this parasite care should be\r\ntaken that human feces are not placed where they will contaminate the feed\r\nor drinking water.\r\n\r\nThis parasite is very common in cattle in the United States, at least 1 per\r\ncent being infested. As a result considerable loss is entailed through\r\ncondemnations of beef carcasses by meat inspectors, because of the presence\r\nof tapeworm cysts. All this loss could be avoided and the danger of\r\ntapeworm infestation in human beings from this source could be removed by\r\nthe observance of proper precautions in disposing of human excreta. At the\r\nsame time much sickness and many deaths from diseases (hookworm, typhoid\r\nfever, etc.) caused by soil pollution would be prevented, and farm life\r\nwould be rendered much safer than under the poor sanitary conditions which\r\nare responsible for the high percentage of tapeworm cysts among cattle in\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREAD WORMS IN THE ABDOMINAL CAVITY.\r\n\r\nThread worms (_Setaria labiato-papillosa_) 2 to 4 inches long are\r\nfrequently found in the abdominal cavity. They seem to cause little or no\r\ntrouble. The embryos produced by these worms enter the blood vessels.\r\nAccording to NoÈ, they are spread from one animal to another by stable\r\nflies (see p. 503), but this has not been definitely proved. The roundworms\r\nfound occasionally in the anterior chamber of the eye (see p. 531) are\r\nperhaps immature forms of this species which have reached this location\r\nduring their migration.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNG WORMS.\r\n\r\nLung worms (_Dictyocaulus viviparus_, fig. 24) in cattle are thread-like\r\nworms 2 to 4 inches long, found in the bronchial tubes and producing a\r\ncondition known as verminous bronchitis. The life history of the parasite\r\nis not fully known, but infection is evidently derived through the medium\r\nof pastures where infested cattle have grazed. In the later stages of the\r\ndisease the cattle cough, especially at night. Young cattle are more\r\nseriously affected than old animals.\r\n\r\n_Treatment for lung worms._--Various treatments have been advocated for\r\nlung worms, including fumigating with different substances and injections\r\nof remedies into the trachea by means of a large hypodermic syringe or by a\r\nspecial spraying apparatus, but none have been very successful from a\r\npractical standpoint. About all that can be done is to feed affected\r\nanimals well and protect them from exposure, removing them from the pasture\r\nand keeping them in dry yards or stables maintained in a cleanly, sanitary\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe methods of prevention in general are similar to those described under\r\nthe discussion of the twisted stomach worm (p. 521).\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 24.--Lung worm (_Dictyocaulus viviparus_) of cattle.\r\n  Outlines showing natural size of male (above) and female.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\nCertain flukes (_Schistosoma bovis_ and related species) which live in the\r\nblood vessels (the large veins) of cattle in tropical and sub-tropical\r\ncountries cause bloody urine and diarrhea, the feces being mixed with\r\nblood. These parasites have not yet been discovered in the United States,\r\nalthough the natural conditions are such in some parts of the country that\r\nthey are liable to become established if introduced.\r\n\r\nThe embryos of _Setaria labiato-papillosa_ (p. 529) which occur in the\r\nblood may be found by microscopical examination. They apparently cause no\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nThe organism which causes Texas fever is a protozoan parasite (_Piroplasma\r\nbigeminum_) of microscopic size, which lives in the blood and attacks the\r\nred blood corpuscles. For a discussion of this parasite and the disease\r\nwhich it produces see page 476 of this volume.\r\n\r\nOther parasites which live in the blood cause serious diseases known as\r\nsurra and nagana (p. 500), but as yet neither of these diseases has gained\r\na foothold in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITES OF THE EYE.\r\n\r\nSmall roundworms, one-third to four-fifths of an inch in length, may occur\r\nin the ducts of the lacrimal glands. Several species all belonging to the\r\nsame genus (_Thelazia_) are known. They sometimes escape from their usual\r\nlocation and may be found on the surface of the eyeball beneath the lids,\r\nor even in the eyeball. It has been supposed by some writers that the worms\r\nseen in the interior of the eyeball (\"snakes in the eye\") are immature\r\nstages of _Setaria labiato-papilosa_ (see p. 529) which have gone astray\r\nfrom the normal course of their migration, but the correctness of this\r\nsupposition is uncertain.\r\n\r\nWorms in the eyes and lacrimal ducts may cause inflammation, in which case\r\nthe eyes may be syringed with an antiseptic, such as a weak solution of\r\ncoal-tar stock dip, and iodoform ointment applied if the condition is\r\nsevere.\r\n\r\nWhen worms are present in the eyeball itself, their removal depends upon\r\nsurgical treatment, usually not advisable, as the worms in that location\r\neither cause but little trouble or disappear without treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Further information may be found in a very full report on \"Insects\r\nAffecting Domestic Animals,\" issued as Bulletin 5, new series, of the\r\nBureau of Entomology of this department.\r\n\r\n[12] Further information on fly repellents may be found in Bulletin 131 of\r\nthe Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[13] For further information consult Farmers' Bulletin 1097.\r\n\r\n[14] For further information consult Circular 115 of the Bureau of\r\nEntomology.\r\n\r\n[15] For further information consult Farmers' Bulletin 857.\r\n\r\n[16] For further information see Farmers' Bulletin 909.\r\n\r\n[17] For a fuller discussion see Farmers' Bulletin 1017, issued by the U.S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[18] For a more complete discussion consult Farmers' Bulletin 1057,\r\nBulletins 130 and 152 of the Bureau of Animal Industry, and Bulletins 15\r\n(technical series), 72, and 106 of the Bureau of Entomology, all issued by\r\nthe United States Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n[19] For further information consult Bureau of Animal Industry Circular\r\n214.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYCOTIC STOMATITIS OF CATTLE.\r\n\r\nBy JOHN R. MOHLER, V. M. D.,\r\n\r\n_Chief, Bureau of Animal Industry._\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nNumerous letters have been received by this bureau in recent years relative\r\nto the existence of a disease affecting the mouths and feet of cattle in\r\ncertain Eastern and Central Western States. Later reports indicate that the\r\nmalady has made its appearance in the Southwest, where it has caused much\r\nalarm among the stockmen owing to its similarity to the foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease of Europe. The disease, which is to be discussed under the name of\r\nmycotic stomatitis, has been carefully investigated by this department on\r\nvarious occasions, and it is with the view of giving the results of these\r\nclinical investigations as well as to assert its noninfectiousness and to\r\ndifferentiate it from the virulent foot-and-mouth disease, which it so\r\nclosely simulates, that this article is prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\nNAME AND SYNONYMS.\r\n\r\nThe name stomatitis signifies that there is present in the affected animals\r\nan inflammation of the mucous membrane of the mouth. This inflammation,\r\nwhich quickly develops into ulcers, is one of the principal and most\r\nfrequently observed lesions. Mycotic stomatitis refers to that form of\r\nstomatitis which results from eating food containing irritant fungi. Thus\r\nthe name not only suggests the cause of the disease, but also indicates the\r\nlocation of the earliest and most prominent symptoms. Other names which\r\nhave been applied to this disease by different writers are sporadic aphthÊ;\r\naphthous stomatitis; sore mouth of cattle; sore tongue; benign, simple, or\r\nnoninfectious foot-and-mouth disease; mycotic aphthous stomatitis; and\r\nsporadic stomatitis aphthosa.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER OF THE DISEASE.\r\n\r\nMycotic stomatitis is a sporadic, or noninfectious, disease which affects\r\ncattle of all ages that are on pasture, but more especially milch cows. It\r\nis characterized by inflammation and ulceration of the mucous membrane of\r\nthe mouth, producing salivation and inappetence, and secondarily affecting\r\nthe feet, which become sore and swollen. Superficial erosions of the skin,\r\nparticularly of the muzzle and of the teats and udders of cows, may also be\r\npresent, with some elevation of temperature and emaciation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSE.\r\n\r\nThis disease, as its name indicates, results from the eating of forage\r\ncontaining fungi or molds. It is probable that more than one fungus is\r\ninvolved in the production of this disease, but no particular species has\r\nbeen definitely proved to be the causative factor. Several attempts have\r\nbeen made by the writer to determine the exact cause and also to transmit\r\nthe disease to other animals by direct inoculation, but with negative\r\nresults. Suspicion, however, has been directed by various observers to the\r\nUromyces and the red and black rusts that occur on clovers. These fungi\r\ncause very severe irritation of the lining membrane of the mouth, producing\r\nsometimes a catarrhal, at other times an aphthous, and occasionally an\r\nulcerous stomatitis. The fungus of rape, etc. (_Polydesmus excitiosus_), is\r\nvery irritating to the mouths and feet of cattle, causing severe\r\ninflammation and in some instances producing symptoms that have been\r\nmistaken for foot-and-mouth disease. The fungi (Penicillium and Puccinia)\r\nfound on grasses have also been credited with the production of stomatitis.\r\nThe fact that this disease disappears from a locality at a certain time and\r\nreappears at irregular intervals would suggest the probability that certain\r\nclimatic conditions were essential for the propagation of the causative\r\nfungi, since it is well known that the malady becomes prevalent after a\r\nhot, dry period has been followed by rain, thus furnishing the requirements\r\nnecessary for the luxuriant development of molds and fungi. Owing to this\r\nfact the disease is observed in one locality during one season and in an\r\nentirely different section another year, but reappears in the former center\r\nwhen favorable conditions prevail. In this way the affection has occurred\r\nat irregular intervals in certain sections of both the United States and\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS AND LESIONS.\r\n\r\nAmong the first symptoms observed in mycotic stomatitis are inability to\r\neat, suspension of rumination, frequent movements of the lips with the\r\nformation of froth on their margins, and in some cases a dribbling of\r\nsaliva from the mouth. There is a desire to eat, and frequent attempts to\r\ntake food are made, but prehension is very difficult. If, however, feed is\r\nplaced on the back of the tongue, it is readily masticated and swallowed.\r\nIf the mouth is examined at this time, it will be found red and hot, and\r\nexceptionally small blisters will be seen, which, however, quickly become\r\neroded and develop into active ulcers varying in size from one-eighth to 1\r\ninch in diameter. Where several ulcers have coalesced a large and\r\nirregularly indented patch is formed. These erosions are most frequently\r\nfound on the gums around the incisor teeth, on the dental pad, inside the\r\nlips, and on the tip of the tongue, but they also occur on the cheeks,\r\ninterdental space, and dorsum of the tongue. The ulcers have a hemorrhagic\r\nborder, a depressed suppurating surface, and contain a brownish or\r\nyellowish colored dÈbris, which is soon replaced by granulation tissue. As\r\na result of this sloughing of the tissues and the retention of food in the\r\nmouth, a very offensive odor is exhaled. The muzzle becomes dry and parched\r\nin appearance, which condition is shortly followed by erosions and\r\nexfoliations of the superficial layer of the skin. Adherent brownish crusts\r\nand scabs form over the parts, and similar lesions are seen around the\r\nnostrils and external surface of the lips.\r\n\r\nIn some cases there are associated with these alterations a slight swelling\r\nand painfulness in the region of the pasterns, at times affecting the\r\nforefeet, at other times the hind feet, and occasionally all four feet. In\r\na few cases the swelling may extend above the fetlock, but it has never\r\nbeen observed above the knee or hock. The skin around the coronet may\r\noccasionally become fissured and the thin skin in the cleft of the foot\r\neroded and suppurated, but without the formation of vesicles. As a result\r\nof these feet lesions, the affected animal may assume a position with its\r\nback arched and the limbs propped under the body as in a case of founder,\r\nand will manifest much pain and lameness in walking. If it lies down, the\r\nanimal shows reluctance in getting up, and although manifesting no\r\ninclination to move about, when forced to do so there is more or less\r\nstiffness and a tendency to kick or shake the foot as if to dislodge a\r\nforeign body from between the claws.\r\n\r\nIn some outbreaks the milch cows have slight superficial erosions on the\r\nteats which at times extend to the udder. The cracks in the skin are filled\r\nwith serum and form brownish-colored scabs. The teats become tender and the\r\nmilk secretion diminishes; in some cases it disappears. A similar tendency\r\ntoward the formation of fissures and scabs on the skin of the neck and\r\nshoulders has manifested itself in a recent outbreak in Texas, and this\r\nfeature was likewise noticeable in the disease when it occurred in Maryland\r\nand Virginia in 1889.\r\n\r\nIn mild cases only the mouth lesions may be observed, or these alterations\r\nmay be associated with one or more of the other above-described symptoms,\r\nbut in severe cases, where there is a generalized mycotic intoxication, one\r\nanimal may show all these alterations. When the disease is well developed\r\nthe general appearance of the animal is one of great lassitude, and it\r\neither stands off by itself with hind feet drawn under the body and its\r\nforefeet extended, or it assumes a recumbent position. Owing to the\r\ninability to eat and to the general systemic disturbance present, the\r\nanimal loses flesh very rapidly and becomes greatly emaciated in the latter\r\nstages of the disease. The temperature and pulse are somewhat increased,\r\nthe former 2 or 3 degrees, the latter to from 75 to 90 beats per minute.\r\nThe fever is not lasting, and these symptoms are soon modified. The animal\r\nhas an anxious look, and in a few cases there is a gastrointestinal\r\nirritation, the feces being thin, of a dark color, and of an offensive\r\nodor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGNOSIS AND MORTALITY.\r\n\r\nMycotic stomatitis is not a serious disease, and in uncomplicated cases\r\nrecoveries soon follow the removal of the cause and the application of the\r\nindicated remedies. In such cases complete restoration may take place\r\nwithin one week. In mild outbreaks a large percentage of the animals will\r\nrecover without treatment, but that the disease is fatal is shown by the\r\nfact that animals which develop an aggravated form of the affection succumb\r\nif not treated. In such animals death occurs in 6 or 8 days, but the\r\nmortality in the serious outbreaks thus far investigated has been less than\r\n0.5 per cent. The course of this disease is irregular and runs from 7 to 15\r\ndays, the average case covering a period of about 10 days.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.\r\n\r\nFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.\r\n\r\nIn examining a case of mycotic stomatitis it is important not to mistake it\r\nfor foot-and-mouth disease, which has appeared in this country on six\r\noccasions only. This may be easily accomplished by taking into\r\nconsideration the fact that in the contagious foot-and-mouth disease there\r\nis a rapid infection of the entire herd, as well as of any hogs and sheep\r\nthat may be on the premises. It is also readily transmitted to neighboring\r\nherds by the spread of the infection from diseased animals, but it never\r\noccurs spontaneously. The characteristic lesion of foot-and-mouth disease\r\nis the appearance of vesicles containing serous fluid in the mouth and upon\r\nthe udder, teats, heels, and coronary bands of the affected animals.\r\nDrooling is profuse, and there is a peculiar smacking sound made by sucking\r\nthe affected lips.\r\n\r\nMycotic stomatitis occurs sporadically on widely separated farms, affecting\r\nonly a few animals in each herd, and the lesions produced consist of\r\nerosions without the typical vesicular formations of foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease. The failure of the vesicles, if any appear, to spread extensively\r\nin the mouth, the absence of these blisters on other portions of the body--\r\nnotably the teats and udder, and characteristically the feet--together with\r\nthe absence of infection in the herd, and the inability to transmit the\r\ndisease to calves by inoculation, distinguish between this affection and\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease. The erosions of the mouth are not so extensive and\r\nthey heal more rapidly in mycotic stomatitis. The swelling of the feet and\r\nstiffness of the animal are also more marked in mycotic stomatitis.\r\n\r\n\r\nERGOTISM.\r\n\r\nThe lesions resulting from ergotism may be differentiated from those of\r\nmycotic stomatitis by the lack of ulcerative eruptions in the mouth and by\r\nthe location of the lesions at the tips of the ears, end of the tail, or\r\nupon the lower part of the legs, usually below the knees or hocks. The\r\nlesions of ergotism do not take the form of ulcers or festers, but the end\r\nof the limb affected is diseased \"in toto\" and the eruption extends\r\nentirely around the limbs, followed soon afterwards by a distinct line of\r\ndemarcation between the healthy skin above and the diseased below. The\r\nabsence of suppurating sores between the claws and on the mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth, the knowledge that the lesion upon the limb in question\r\nextends uninterruptedly around it, and the presence of ergotized seeds in\r\nthe hay or grain fed the animals should point conclusively to a diagnosis\r\nof ergotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOUL FOOT.\r\n\r\nIn foul foot, or ground itch, of cattle, the inflammation of the skin and\r\ntoes usually affects but one foot. It begins as a superficial inflammation\r\nfollowed by sloughing, ulceration, and the formation of fistulous tracts\r\nwhich may involve the tendons, bones, and joints. The mouth remains\r\nunaffected, and the presence of the disease may be traced to filth and poor\r\ndrainage.\r\n\r\n\r\nNECROTIC STOMATITIS.\r\n\r\nIn necrotic stomatitis (calf diphtheria) there is a formation of yellowish\r\ncheesy patches in the mouth without any lesions of the feet or udder. It\r\naffects sucking calves chiefly, and is caused by the _Bacillus\r\nnecrophorus._\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of mycotic stomatitis should consist in first removing the\r\nherd of cattle from the pasture in which they have been running. The\r\naffected animals should, if it is possible, be brought to the barn or\r\ncorral and fed on soft, nutritious food, such as bran mashes, ground feed,\r\nand gruels. A bucket of clear, cool water should be kept constantly in the\r\nmanger, so that the animal may drink or rinse the mouth at its pleasure;\r\nand it will be found beneficial to dissolve 2 heaping tablespoonfuls of\r\nborax or 1 tablespoonful of potassium chlorate in each of the first two\r\nbuckets of water taken during the day. If the animals are gentle enough to\r\nbe handled, the mouth should be swabbed out daily with antiseptic washes,\r\nsuch as a 2 per cent solution of carbolic acid or a 1 per cent solution of\r\ncompound solution of cresol or of permanganate of potassium, or 1 part of\r\nhydrogen peroxid to 2 parts of water. This should be followed by\r\nastringents, such as one-half tablespoonful of alum, borax, or chlorate of\r\npotassium placed on the tongue. Probably a more satisfactory method of\r\nadministering the antiseptic treatment to a large number of animals would\r\nbe to mix thoroughly 2 teaspoonfuls of pure carbolic acid every morning in\r\na quart of bran mash and give to each affected animal for a period of five\r\ndays. Range cattle may be more readily treated by the use of medicated salt\r\nplaced in troughs accessible to the animals. This salt may be prepared by\r\npouring 4 ounces of crude carbolic acid upon 12 quarts of ordinary barrel\r\nsalt, after which they are thoroughly mixed. The lesions of the feet should\r\nbe treated with a 2 per cent solution of carbolic acid, while the fissures\r\nand other lesions of the skin will be benefited by the application of\r\ncarbolized vaseline or zinc ointment.
