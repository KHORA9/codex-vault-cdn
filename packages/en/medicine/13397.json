This business never grew to be more than a modest\r\nundertaking in modern industrial terms, and amid the congestion of any\r\nlarge city its few buildings straddling a branch railroad and its work\r\nforce of several dozens at most would have been little noticed, but in\r\nits rural setting the enterprise occupied a prominent role in the\r\neconomic life of the community for over ninety years. Aside from the\r\nomnipresent forest and dairy industries, it represented the only\r\nmanufacturing activity for miles around and was easily the largest\r\nsingle employer in its village, as well as the chief recipient and\r\nshipper of freight at the adjacent railroad station. For some years,\r\nearly in the present century, the company supplied a primitive electric\r\nservice to the community, and the Comstock Hotel, until it was destroyed\r\nby fire, served as the principal village hostelry.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of this business was by no means strictly local. For\r\ndecades thousands of boxes of pills and bottles of elixir, together with\r\nadvertising circulars and almanacs in the millions, flowed out of this\r\nremote village to druggists in thousands of communities in the United\r\nStates and Canada, in Latin America, and in the Orient. And Dr. Morse's\r\nIndian Root Pills and the other remedies must have been household names\r\nwherever people suffered aches and infirmities. Thus Morristown,\r\nnotwithstanding its placid appearance, played an active role in commerce\r\nand industry throughout the colorful patent-medicine era.\r\n\r\nToday, the Indian Root Pill factory stands abandoned and forlorn--its\r\ndecline and demise brought on by an age of more precise medical\r\ndiagnoses and the more stringent enforcement of various food and drug\r\nacts. After abandonment, the factory was ransacked by vandals; and\r\nrecords, documents, wrappers, advertising circulars, pills awaiting\r\npackaging, and other effects were thrown down from the shelves and\r\nscattered over the floors. This made it impossible to recover and\r\nexamine the records systematically. The former proprietors of the\r\nbusiness, however, had for some reason--perhaps sheer\r\ninertia--apparently preserved all of their records for over a century,\r\nstoring them in the loft-like attic over the packaging building. Despite\r\ntheir careless treatment, enough records were recovered to reconstruct\r\nmost of the history of the Comstock enterprise and to cast new light\r\nupon the patent-medicine industry of the United States during its\r\nheyday.\r\n\r\nThe Comstock business, of course, was far from unique. Hundreds of\r\nmanufacturers of proprietary remedies flourished during the 1880s and\r\n1890s the Druggists' Directory for 1895 lists approximately 1,500. The\r\ngreat majority of these factories were much smaller than Comstock; one\r\nsuspects, in fact, that most of them were no more than backroom\r\nenterprises conducted by untrained, but ambitious, druggists who, with\r\nparttime help, mixed up some mysterious concoctions and contrived\r\nimaginative advertising schemes. A few of these businesses were\r\nconsiderably larger than Comstock.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Comstock company would seem to be typical of the more\r\nstrongly established patent-medicine manufacturers, and therefore a\r\ncloser examination of this particular enterprise should also illuminate\r\nits entire industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Origin of the Business*\r\n\r\nThe Indian Root Pill business was carried on during most of its\r\nexistence by two members of the Comstock family--father and son--and\r\nbecause of unusual longevity, this control by two generations extended\r\nfor over a century. The plant was also located in Morristown for\r\napproximately ninety years. The Indian Root Pills, however, were not\r\nactually originated by the Comstock family, nor were they discovered in\r\nMorristown. Rather, the business had its genesis in New York City, at a\r\ntime when the city still consisted primarily of two-or three-story\r\nbuildings and did not extend beyond the present 42nd Street.\r\n\r\nAccording to an affidavit written in 1851--and much of the history of\r\nthe business is derived from documents prepared in connection with\r\nnumerous lawsuits--the founder of the Comstock drug venture was Edwin\r\nComstock, sometime in or before 1833. Edwin, along with the numerous\r\nother brothers who will shortly enter the picture, was a son of Samuel\r\nComstock, of Butternuts, Otsego County, New York. Samuel, a\r\nfifth-generation descendant of William Comstock, one of the pioneer\r\nsettlers of New London, Connecticut, and ancestor of most of the\r\nComstocks in America, was born in East Lyme, Connecticut, a few years\r\nbefore the Revolution, but sometime after the birth of Edwin in 1794 he\r\nmoved to Otsego County, New York.\r\n\r\nEdwin, in 1828, moved to Batavia, New York, where his son, William Henry\r\nComstock, was born on August 1, 1830. Within four or five years,\r\nhowever, Edwin repaired to New York City, where he established the\r\nextensive drug and medicine business that was to be carried on by\r\nmembers of his family for over a century. Just why Edwin performed this\r\nbrief sojourn in Batavia, or where he made his initial entry into the\r\ndrug trade, is not clear, although the rapid growth of his firm in New\r\nYork City suggests that he had had previous experience in that field. It\r\nis a plausible surmise that he may have worked in Batavia in the drug\r\nstore of Dr. Levant B. Cotes, which was destroyed in the village-wide\r\nfire of April 19, 1833; the termination of Edwin's career in Batavia\r\nmight have been associated either with that disaster or with the death\r\nof his wife in 1831.\r\n\r\nThe Comstocks also obviously had some medical tradition in their family.\r\nSamuel's younger brother, John Lee Comstock, was trained as a physician\r\nand served in that capacity during the War of 1812--although he was to\r\ngain greater prominence as a historian and natural philosopher. All five\r\nof Samuel's sons participated at least briefly in the drug trade, while\r\ntwo of them also had careers as medical doctors. A cousin of Edwin,\r\nThomas Griswold Comstock (born 1829), also became a prominent\r\nhomeopathic physician and gynecologist in St. Louis.[1] It might also be\r\nsignificant that the original home of the Comstock family, in\r\nConnecticut, was within a few miles of the scene of the discovery of the\r\nfirst patent medicine in America--Lee's \"Bilious Pills\"--by Dr. Samuel\r\nLee (1744-1805), of Windham, sometime prior to 1796.[2] This medicine\r\nenjoyed such a rapid success that it was soon being widely imitated, and\r\nthe Comstocks could not have been unaware of its popularity.\r\n\r\nSo it seems almost certain that Edwin was no longer a novice when he\r\nestablished his own drug business in New York City. Between 1833 and\r\n1837 he employed his brother, Lucius S. Comstock (born in 1806), as a\r\nclerk, and for the next fifteen years Lucius will figure very\r\nconspicuously in this story. He not merely appended the designation\r\n\"M.D.\" to his name and claimed membership in the Medical Society of the\r\nCity of New York, but also described himself as a Counsellor-at-Law.\r\n\r\nEdwin, the founder of the business, did not live long to enjoy its\r\nprosperity--or perhaps we should say that he was fortunate enough to\r\npass away before it experienced its most severe vicissitudes and trials.\r\nAfter Edwin's death in 1837, Lucius continued the business in\r\npartnership with another brother, Albert Lee, under the style of\r\nComstock & Co. Two more brothers, John Carlton (born 1819) and George\r\nWells (born 1820), were employed as clerks.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _National Cyclopedia of American Biography_, VII: 280.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Comstock brothers' grandmother, Esther Lee, was\r\napparently unrelated to Dr. Samuel Lee, the inventor of the Bilious\r\nPills.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 1.--Original wrapper for Carltons Liniment,\r\n1851.]\r\n\r\nThe partnership of Comstock & Co. between Lucius and Albert was\r\nterminated by a dispute between the two brothers in 1841, and Albert\r\nwent his own way, taking up a career as a physician and living until\r\n1876. Lucius next went into business with his mother-in-law, Anne Moore,\r\nfrom 1841 to 1846; after the dissolution of this firm, he formed a new\r\npartnership, also under the name of Comstock & Co., with his brother\r\nJohn (generally known as J. Carlton). This firm again employed as clerks\r\nGeorge Wells Comstock and a nephew, William Henry, a son of Edwin.\r\nWilliam Henry was to eventually become the founder of the business at\r\nMorristown.\r\n\r\nIn March of 1849, still a new partnership was formed, comprising Lucius,\r\nJ. Carlton, and George Wells, under the name of Comstock & Co. Brothers,\r\nalthough the existing partnership of Comstock & Co. was not formally\r\nterminated. Assets, inventories, and receivables in the process of\r\ncollection were assigned by Comstock & Co. to Comstock & Co. Brothers.\r\nBut before the end of 1849 the partners quarreled, Lucius fell out with\r\nhis brothers, and after a period of dissension, the firm of Comstock &\r\nCo. Brothers was dissolved as of August 1, 1850. On or about the same\r\ndate J. Carlton and George Wells formed a new partnership, under the\r\nname of Comstock & Brother, doing business at 9 John Street in New York\r\nCity, also taking their nephew, William Henry, as a clerk. Lucius\r\ncontinued in business at the old address of 57 John Street. As early as\r\nJune 30, 1851, the new firm of Comstock & Brother registered the\r\nfollowing trade names[3] with the Smithsonian Institution: Carlton's\r\nLiniment, a certain remedy for the Piles; Carlton's Celebrated Nerve and\r\nBone Liniment for Horses; Carlton's Condition Powder for Horses and\r\nCattle; Judson's Chemical Extract of Cherry and Lungwort.\r\n\r\nThe repetition of his name suggests that J. Carlton was the principal\r\ninventor of his firm's remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuits and Countersuits\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing changes in name and business organization must have\r\nbeen highly confusing to the wide array of agents and retail druggists\r\nover many states and the provinces of Canada with whom these several\r\nfirms had been doing business. And when George Wells and J. Carlton\r\nsplit off from Lucius and established their own office down the street,\r\nit was not at all clear who really represented the original Comstock\r\nbusiness, who had a right to collect the numerous accounts and notes\r\nstill outstanding, and who owned the existing trade names and formulas.\r\nDispute was inevitable under such circumstances, and it was aggravated\r\nby Lucius' irascible temper. Unfortunately for family harmony, these\r\nbusiness difficulties also coincided with differences among the brothers\r\nover their father's will. Samuel had died in 1840, but his will was not\r\nprobated until 1846; for some reason Lucius contested its terms. There\r\nhad also been litigation over the estate of Edwin, the elder brother.\r\n\r\nWith the inability of the two parties to reach friendly agreement, a\r\nlawsuit was initiated in June 1850 between Lucius on the one hand and J.\r\nCarlton and George Wells on the other for the apportionment of the\r\nproperty of Comstock & Co. Brothers, which was valued at about $25,000\r\nor $30,000. Subsequently, while this litigation was dragging on, Lucius\r\nfound a more satisfying opportunity to press his quarrel against his\r\nbrothers. This arose out of his belief that they were taking his mail\r\nout of the post office.\r\n\r\nOn May 26, 1851, one of the New York newspapers, the _Day Book_, carried\r\nthe following item:\r\n\r\n     United States Marshal's Office--Complaint was made against J.\r\n     Carlton Comstock and Geo. Wells Comstock, of No. 9 John Street, and\r\n     a clerk in their employ, for taking letters from the Post Office,\r\n     belonging to Dr. L.S. Comstock, of 57 in the same street.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Comstock having missed a large number of letters, on inquiry at\r\n     the Post Office it was suspected that they had been taken to No. 9\r\n     John Street.\r\n\r\n     By an arrangement with the Postmaster and his assistants, several\r\n     letters were then put in the Post Office, containing orders\r\n     addressed to Dr. Comstock, at 57 John Street, for goods to be sent\r\n     to various places in the city to be forwarded to the country. The\r\n     letters were taken by the accused or their clerk, opened at No. 9,\r\n     the money taken out and the articles sent as directed, accompanied\r\n     by bills in the handwriting of Geo. Wells Comstock. Warrants were\r\n     then issued by the U.S. Commissioner and Recorder Talmadge, and two\r\n     of the accused found at home were arrested and a large number of\r\n     letters belonging to Dr. C. found on the premises. J.C. Comstock\r\n     has not yet been arrested. It is said he is out of the city.\r\n\r\n     These two young men have for some months been trading sometimes\r\n     under the name of \"Comstock & Brother\", and sometimes as \"Judson &\r\n     Co.\" at No. 9 John Street.\r\n\r\nThe same episode was also mentioned in the _Express_, the _Commercial\r\nAdvertiser_, and the _Tribune_. In fact, a spirited debate in the\r\n\"affair of the letters\" was carried on in the pages of the press for a\r\nweek. The brothers defended themselves in the following notice printed\r\nin the _Morning Express_ for May 31:\r\n\r\n     OBTAINING LETTERS\r\n\r\n     Painful as it is, we are again compelled to appear before the\r\n     public in defense of our character as citizens and business men.\r\n     The two letters referred to by L.S. Comstock (one of which\r\n     contained One Dollar only) _were both directed \"Comstock & Co.\"\r\n     which letters we claim; and we repeat what we have before said, and\r\n     what we shall prove that no letter or letters from any source\r\n     directed to L.S. Comstock or Lucius S. Comstock have been taken or\r\n     obtained by either of us or any one in our employ_.\r\n\r\n     The public can judge whether a sense of \"duty to the Post Office\r\n     Department and the community\", induced our brother to make this\r\n     charge against us (which if proved would consign us to the\r\n     Penitentiary) and under the pretence of searching for letters,\r\n     which perhaps never existed; to send Police Officers to invade not\r\n     only our store, but our dwelling house, where not even the presence\r\n     of our aged Mother could protect from intrusion. These are the\r\n     means by which he has put himself\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Receipts for these registrations were signed by the\r\nprominent librarian, Charles Coffin Jewett, later to be superintendent\r\nof the Boston Public Library for many years.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 2.--Wrapper for Oldridge's Balm of Columbia,\r\nComstock & Co., druggists.]\r\n\r\n     in possession of the _names of our customers; of our\r\n     correspondence_; and our private and business papers.\r\n\r\n     J.C. & GEO. WELLS COMSTOCK, firm of Comstock & Brother, No. 9 John\r\n     Street\r\n\r\nLucius, for his part, never deigned to recognize his opponents as\r\nbrothers but merely described them as \"two young men who claim\r\nrelationship to me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the position of J. Carlton and George that as they, equally with\r\nLucius, were heirs of the dissolved firm of Comstock & Co. Brothers,\r\nthey had as much right as Lucius to receive and open letters so\r\naddressed. Moreover, since the predecessor firm of Comstock & Co. had\r\nnever been dissolved, J. Carlton also shared in any rights, claims, or\r\nproperty of this firm. In a more personal vein, the brothers also\r\nasserted in their brief that Lucius \"is not on speaking terms with his\r\naged mother nor any one of his brothers or sisters, Nephews or Nieces,\r\nor even of his Uncles or Aunts, embracing quite a large circle all of\r\nwhom have been estranged from him, either by personal difficulties with\r\nhim, or his improper conduct towards his brothers.\" Lucius, in turn, had\r\ncopies of his charges against his brothers, together with aspersions\r\nagainst their character and their medicines, printed as circulars and\r\nwidely distributed to all present or former customers in the United\r\nStates and Canada.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the civil litigation respecting the division of the assets of\r\nthe old partnership, broken down into a welter of complaints and\r\ncountercomplaints, dragged on until 1852. No document reporting the\r\nprecise terms of the final settlement was discovered, although the\r\naffair was obviously compromised on some basis, as the surviving records\r\ndo speak of a division of the stock in New York City and at St. Louis.\r\nThe original premises at 57 John Street were left in the possession of\r\nLucius. In this extensive litigation, J. Carlton and George were\r\nrepresented by the law firm of Allen, Hudson & Campbell, whose bill for\r\n$2,132 they refused to pay in full, so that they were, in turn, sued by\r\nthe Allen firm. Some of the lengthy evidence presented in this\r\ncollection suit enlightened further the previous contest with Lucius. He\r\nwas described as an extremely difficult person: \"at one time the parties\r\ncame to blows--and G.W. gave the Dr. a black eye.\" The action by the\r\nlaw firm to recover its fee was finally compromised by the payment of\r\n$1,200 in January 1854.\r\n\r\nThe settlement of the affairs of Comstock & Co. Brothers failed to bring\r\npeace between Lucius and the others. The rival successor firms continued\r\nto bicker over sales territory and carried the battle out into the\r\ncountryside, each contending for the loyalty of former customers.\r\nLetters and circulars attacking their opponents were widely distributed\r\nby both parties. As late as December 1855, more than four years after\r\nthe event, Lucius was still complaining, in a series of printed\r\ncirculars, about the \"robbery\" of his mail from the post office,\r\nalthough the case had been dismissed by the court.\r\n\r\nBut somehow the new firm of Comstock & Brother triumphed over Comstock &\r\nCo., for in the summer of 1853 Lucius found it necessary to make an\r\nassignment of all of his assets to his creditors. Thereafter he removed\r\nhis business from John Street to 45 Vesey Street, in the rear of St.\r\nPaul's Churchyard, but although he put out impressive new handbills\r\ndescribing his firm as \"Wholesale Chemists, Druggists and Perfumers,\" he\r\napparently no longer prospered in the drug trade, for old New York City\r\ndirectories show that he shortly turned his main energies to the\r\npractice of law. Versatile as he was, Lucius entered the Union Army as a\r\nsurgeon during the Civil War, and upon his return he resumed his legal\r\ncareer, continuing to his death in 1876. Aside from his role in the\r\nComstock medicine business, Lucius also rates a footnote in United\r\nStates political history as the foreman of the grand jury that indicted\r\nBoss Tweed in 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n*A New Partnership Formed*\r\n\r\nThe two proprietors of Comstock & Brother at 9 John Street were the\r\nbrothers George Wells and J. Carlton Comstock. At the time of the events\r\njust related, their nephew, William Henry Comstock, was an employee, but\r\nnot a partner, of the firm (he was the \"clerk\" who had removed the\r\ncontroversial letters from the post office). This partnership was\r\nterminated by the death on September 17, 1853, of J. Carlton Comstock,\r\nthe inventor of the veterinary medicines.\r\n\r\nTo continue the business, a new partnership, also under the name of\r\nComstock & Brother, comprising George Wells Comstock, William Henry\r\nComstock, and Baldwin L. Judson, was formed on October 1, 1853. Judson\r\nwas the husband of Eliza, a sister of Lucius and his brothers. George\r\ncontributed one half of the capital of the new firm and the other two,\r\none quarter each; however, exclusive possession of all trademarks,\r\nrecipes, and rights to the medicines was reserved to George. It is not\r\nclear precisely when Judson entered the drug business or first became\r\nassociated with the Comstocks; there is some evidence that he had\r\npreviously been in business for himself, as several remedies were\r\nregistered by him prior to this time. Judson's Chemical Extract was\r\nregistered with the Smithsonian by the Comstock firm in 1851, but Dr.\r\nLarzetti's Juno Cordial or Procreative Elixir had previously been\r\nentered by Judson & Co. in 1844. A variant of the Juno Cordial label\r\nalso mentions Levi Judson (a father?) as Dr. Larzetti's only agent in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBesides the \"new\" remedies, the Comstock firm--both Comstock firms--was\r\nalso selling all of the \"old\" patent medicines, most of them of British\r\norigin. These included such items as Godfrey's Cordial, Bateman's\r\nPectoral Drops, Turlington's Balsam of Life, British Oil, and others.\r\nThe only strictly American product that could claim a venerability\r\nsomewhat approaching these was Samuel Lee's Bilious Pills, patented on\r\nApril 30, 1796.\r\n\r\nMost of the more recent remedies probably had been originated by local\r\ndoctors or druggists, either upon experimentation or following old folk\r\nremedies, and after enjoying some apparent success were adopted by drug\r\nmanufacturers. With rare exceptions, however, the names of the\r\ndiscoverers never seem to have made their way into medical history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 3.--Original wrapper for Judson's Chemical Extract\r\nof Cherry and Lungwort, printed about 1855.]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Entrance of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills*\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1855 the Comstock firm, now located at 50 Leonard\r\nStreet, was approached by one Andrew J. White, who represented himself\r\nas the sole proprietor of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and who had\r\npreviously manufactured them in his own business, conducted under the\r\nname of A.B. Moore, at 225 Main Street, in Buffalo. Actually, White's\r\nmain connection with this business had been as a clerk, and he had been\r\ntaken in as a partner only recently. Nevertheless, the Comstocks\r\naccepted his claims--carelessly, one must believe--and on August 10,\r\n1855, signed a contract with White for the manufacture and distribution\r\nof these pills.\r\n\r\nThe originator of these pills was Andrew B. Moore. This is clear from\r\nseveral legal documents, including an injunction proceeding in behalf of\r\nWhite and Moore in 1859, which reads in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     The defendant Moore always had an equal right with White to\r\n     manufacture the pills--and by the agreement of 21st June, 1858\r\n     Moore is (illegible) to his original right and the defendants are\r\n     manufacturing under Moore's original right....\r\n\r\n     The plaintiffs (the Comstocks) by their acts have disenabled Moore\r\n     from using _his own name_.... (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 4.--Label for Dr. Larzetti's Juno Cordial, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 5.--List of medicines offered by Comstock &\r\nBrother (predecessor of the firm which later moved to Morristown) in\r\n1854.]\r\n\r\nIn an undated form of contract, between Moore on the one part and George\r\nComstock, William H. Comstock, Judson, and White on the other part, the\r\nparties agree, at Moore's option, either to sell all rights and interest\r\nin Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills to him, or to buy them from him, but in\r\nthe latter event he must covenant that \"he will forever refrain from the\r\nmanufacture or sale of any medicine called Dr. Morse's Root Pills,\r\nMoore's Indian Root Pills, or Morse's Pills, or Moore's Pills, or any\r\nother name or designation similar to or resembling in any way either\r\nthereof....\"\r\n\r\nIn brief, there never was a Dr. Morse--other than Andrew B. Moore. And\r\nthe Comstocks never claimed any origin of the pills in legal documents,\r\nother than their purchase from White. Subsequently, the company\r\nfabricated a lengthy history of the discovery of the pills and even\r\npictured Dr. Morse with his \"healthy, blooming family.\" This story was\r\nprinted in almanacs and in a wrapper accompanying every box of pills.\r\nAccording to this version, \"the famous and celebrated Dr. Morse,\" after\r\ncompleting his education in medical science, traveled widely in Asia,\r\nAfrica, Europe, and North America, and spent three years among the\r\nIndians of our western country, where he discovered the secret of the\r\nIndian Root Pills. Returning from one of these journeys after a long\r\nabsence, he found his father apparently on his death bed. But let us\r\nquote the story directly:\r\n\r\n     A number of years ago this good man was very sick. He had eight of\r\n     the most celebrated doctors to attend him both night and day. With\r\n     all their skill this good and pious gentleman grew worse, and\r\n     finally they gave him up, saying that it was impossible to cure him\r\n     and he would soon die ... In the afternoon he was taken with\r\n     shortness of breath and supposed to be dying. The neighbors were\r\n     sent for, the room soon filled, and many prayers were offered up\r\n     from the very hearts of these dear Christian people, that some\r\n     relief might be obtained for this good and pious man.\r\n\r\n     While these prayers were ascending like sweet incense to the throne\r\n     above, and every eye was bathed in tears, a rumbling noise was\r\n     heard in the distance, like a mighty chariot winding its way near,\r\n     when all at once a fine span of horses, before a beautiful coach,\r\n     stood before the door, out of which alighted a noble and\r\n     elegant-looking man. In a moment's time he entered the room, and\r\n     embraced the hand of his dear father and mother. She clasped her\r\n     arms around his neck and fainted away.\r\n\r\n     The Doctor, surprised to see his father so nearly gone, immediately\r\n     went to his coach, taking therefrom various plants and roots, which\r\n     he had learned from the Red Men of the forest as being good for all\r\n     diseases, and gave them to his father, and in about two hours\r\n     afterwards he was much relieved.... Two days afterwards he was much\r\n     better, and the third day he could walk about the room ...and now\r\n     we behold him a strong, active man, and in the bloom of health, and\r\n     at the age of ninety-five able to ride in one day thirty-five\r\n     miles, in order to spend his birthday with this celebrated Doctor,\r\n     his son.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing event was supposed to have occurred some years before\r\n1847, as the elder Mr. Morse's ninety-fifth birthday referred to was\r\ncelebrated on November 20, 1847, when he was still hale and hearty. The\r\nold gentleman was also said to be enormously wealthy, \"with an income of\r\nabout five hundred thousand dollars annually, and the owner of a number\r\nof fine, elegant ships, which sailed in different directions to every\r\npart of the world.\" Dr. Morse, who was the first man to establish that\r\nall diseases arise from the impurity of the blood, subsequently\r\ndiscarded his regular practice of medicine and, as a boon to mankind,\r\ndevoted his entire energy to the manufacture of Dr. Morse's Indian Root\r\nPills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 6.-\"A Short History of Dr. Morse's Father.\" A copy\r\nwas inserted in every box of the pills.]\r\n\r\nThis story, which was first disseminated as early as the late 1850s, was\r\nan entire fabrication. Throughout the patent-medicine era it was the\r\ncommon practice to ascribe an Indian, or at least some geographically\r\nremote, origin to all of these nostrums and panaceas. In the words of\r\nJames Harvey Young, in his book on the Social History of Patent\r\nMedicines:[4]\r\n\r\n     From the 1820's onward the Indian strode nobly through the American\r\n     patent-medicine wilderness. Hiawatha helped a hair restorative and\r\n     Pocahontas blessed a bitters. Dr. Fall spent twelve years with the\r\n     Creeks to discover why no Indian had ever perished of consumption.\r\n     Edwin Eastman found a blood syrup among the Comanches. Texas\r\n     Charlie discovered a Kickapoo cure-all, and Frank Cushing pried the\r\n     secret of a stomach renovator from the Zuni. (Frank, a famous\r\n     ethnologist, had gone West on a Smithsonian expedition.) Besides\r\n     these notable accretions to pharmacy, there were Modoc Oil,\r\n     Seminole Cough Balsam, Nez Perce Catarrh Snuff, and scores more,\r\n     all doubtless won for the use of white men by dint of great cunning\r\n     and valor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Young, James Harvey, _The Toadstool Millionaires, A Social\r\nHistory of Patent Medicines in America before Federal Regulation_.\r\nPrinceton University Press. 1961.]\r\n\r\nJudson's Mountain Herb Pills, a companion product of the Indian Root\r\nPills, had an even more romantic origin--so remarkable, in fact, that\r\nthe story was embodied in a full-scale paperback novel published by B.L.\r\nJudson & Co. in 1859. According to this book, the remedy was\r\ndiscovered--or at least revealed to the world--by a famous adventurer,\r\nDr. Cunard. Dr. Cunard's career somehow bore a remarkable similarity to\r\nthat of Dr. Morse. He was also the scion of a wealthy family who spent\r\nmuch time traveling throughout the world, and in this process becoming\r\nfluent in no less than thirty languages. Eventually he encountered an\r\nAztec princess about to be tortured and sacrificed by Navajo Indians; he\r\ninterrupted this ceremony only to be captured himself, but by virtue of\r\nsuccessfully foretelling an eclipse (happily he had his almanac with\r\nhim) he won release for himself and the princess. Thereafter he led her\r\nback to her home, in some remote part of Mexico, and lived among her\r\npeople for a year. As a boon for having saved the princess, he was given\r\npossession of the ancient healing formula of the Aztecs. Upon returning\r\nhome Dr. Cunard, in an experience very similar to Dr. Morse's, found his\r\nmother on her death bed, but he effected an instant cure by the use of\r\nthe miraculous herbs he had brought with him. The news spread, soon a\r\nwide circle of neighbors was clamoring for this medicine, and in order\r\nthat all mankind might share in these benefits, Dr. Cunard graciously\r\nconveyed the secret to B.L. Judson & Co.\r\n\r\nThese stories were told entirely straightforwardly, with the intention\r\nof being believed. How widely they were actually accepted is difficult\r\nto say. In retrospect it seems extremely curious that persons as\r\nprominent, as successful, as wealthy as Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard were\r\nnever seen or heard by the public, were never mentioned in the\r\nnewspapers, never ran for public office, their names never listed in any\r\ndirectories, biographies or encyclopedias, and in fact they were not\r\nnoticed anywhere--except in the advertising material of Comstock & Co.\r\nand B.L. Judson. Perhaps such credulity was not unusual in the 1850s,\r\nbefore the advent of widely distributed newspapers and other means of\r\ncommunication, but more than fifty years later, in the early years of\r\nthe present century, essentially the same version of the history of Dr.\r\nMorse was still being printed in the Comstock almanacs.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Struggle for Control of the Indian Root Pills*\r\n\r\nThe agreement of August 10, 1855, between Andrew J. White and the\r\nComstocks established a partnership \"for the purpose of manufacturing\r\nand selling Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and for no other purpose,\" the\r\npartners thereof being A.J. White as an individual and Comstock &\r\nBrother as a firm. The new partnership was named A.J. White & Co., but\r\nWhite contributed no money or property--nothing but the right to Dr.\r\nMorse's Indian Root Pills. The Comstock firm supplied all of the\r\ntangible assets, together with the use of their existing business\r\npremises. In turn, Comstock was to receive three fourths and White one\r\nfourth of the profits. In brief, the new firm, although bearing White's\r\nname, was controlled by the Comstocks.\r\n\r\nIt is not clear why Moore, the originator of the pills, was not taken\r\ninto the new business or otherwise recognized in the agreement. As we\r\nhave seen, White claimed absolute ownership of Dr. Morse's Indian Root\r\nPills, but Moore evidently did not agree, for he continued to\r\nmanufacture and peddle his own pills, at the same time denouncing those\r\nprepared by A.J. White & Co. under Comstock control as forgeries. Moore\r\nhad previously been in business in Buffalo, at 225 Main Street, under\r\nhis own name; an announcement in the 1854 Buffalo City Directory (the\r\n_Commercial Advertiser_) describes his firm as successor both to C.C.\r\nBristol and to Moore, Liebetrut & Co. The same directory shows White as\r\nmerely a clerk at Moore's place of business, although he was made a\r\npartner sometime during 1854.\r\n\r\nCyrenius C. Bristol, whose business Moore took over, had entered the\r\ndrug trade in 1832, initially in partnership with a Dr. G.E. Hayes. In\r\nthe drug field his best known preparation was Bristol's renowned\r\nsarsaparilla, and he is credited with having originated the\r\npatent-medicine almanac, along with other advertising innovations. The\r\npatent-medicine business, however, represented merely one of his\r\nwide-ranging interests; he was also a co-owner of vessels plying the\r\nGreat Lakes, a publisher, and a dabbler in such occult arts as\r\nMesmerism, Phrenology, and Morse's theory of the electric telegraph. In\r\n1855 he appeared as the proprietor of the _Daily Republic_, and it was\r\nperhaps his growing involvement in publishing that led him to turn his\r\ndrug business over to Moore.\r\n\r\nWhile we know this much about Moore's antecedents, a very considerable\r\nmystery remains. If Moore was the proprietor of his own apparently\r\nprosperous drug and medicine business in Buffalo in 1854, with White as\r\none of his clerks, how did it happen that in the following year White\r\nrepresented himself to the Comstocks as the sole owner of Dr. Morse's\r\n(Moore's) Indian Root Pills? And Moore, although he initially disputed\r\nthis claim, left his own business in Buffalo and ultimately joined White\r\nand the Comstocks, not even in the capacity of a partner, but merely as\r\nan employee.\r\n\r\nThese events would seem, however, to date the origin of the Indian Root\r\nPills fairly closely. Moore was already manufacturing them in Buffalo\r\nprior to White's initial agreement with the Comstocks, but as he did not\r\nmention them by name in his _Commercial Advertiser_ announcement in\r\n1854, it is a fair presumption that the pills were new at this time. But\r\nthey must have caught on very rapidly to induce the Comstocks to enter a\r\npartnership with White, under his name, when he contributed only the\r\nIndian Root Pills but no cash or other tangible assets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 7.--Wrapper for Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills,\r\nA.J. White & Co., sole proprietor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 8.--Indian Root Pill labels: _a_, original used\r\nby Moore, the originator of the pills; _b_, initial label used by A.J.\r\nWhite & Co. under Comstock ownership, 1855-1857; _c_, revised label\r\nadopted by Comstocks in June 1857 after Moore changed the color of his\r\nlabel to blue; _d_, label adopted by Moore and White for selling in\r\ncompetition with the Comstocks, 1859. Obviously printed from the same\r\nplate as _c_, but with an additional signature just above the Indian on\r\nhorseback; _e_, new label adopted by the Comstocks after the departure\r\nof Moore and White; _f_, label used in the final years of the business;\r\n_g_, label, in Spanish, used in final years for export trade to Latin\r\nAmerica.]\r\n\r\nWhile manufacturing the pills in Buffalo, Moore had been packaging them\r\nunder a yellow label bearing a pictorial representation of the British\r\ncoat-of-arms, flanked on one side by an Indian and on the other by a\r\nfigure probably supposed to represent a merchant or a sea captain. The\r\nlabels also described Moore as the proprietor, \"without whose signature\r\nnone can be genuine.\" And after the formation of A.J. White & Co. and\r\nthe purported transfer of Dr. Morse's pills to it, Moore still continued\r\nto sell the same medicine and to denounce the White-Comstock product as\r\nspurious. The latter was packaged under a white label showing an Indian\r\nwarrior riding horseback and was signed \"A.J. White & Co.\" While the\r\ncolor was shortly changed to blue and the name of the proprietor several\r\ntimes amended through the ensuing vicissitudes, the label otherwise\r\nremained substantially unchanged for as long as the pills continued to\r\nbe manufactured, or for over 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe nuisance of Moore's independent manufacture of the pills was\r\ntemporarily eliminated when, on June 21, 1858, Moore was hired by A.J.\r\nWhite & Co.[5] and abandoned competition with them. The Comstocks, in\r\nemploying him, insisted upon a formal, written agreement whereunder\r\nMoore agreed to discontinue any manufacture or sale of the pills and to\r\nassign all rights and title therein, together with any related\r\nengravings, cuts, or designs, to A.J. White & Co. As previously stated,\r\nthe two Comstock brothers, Judson, and White had offered either to sell\r\nthe Indian Root Pill business in its entirety to Moore, or to buy it\r\nfrom him. Moore's employment by A.J. White & Co. presumably followed his\r\nelection not to purchase and operate the business himself.\r\n\r\nSo far so good. The Comstocks' claim to the Indian Root Pills through\r\nthe 75 percent controlled A.J. White & Co. now seemed absolutely secure\r\nand the disparagement of their products at an end. But new dissension\r\nmust have occurred, for on New Year's Day of 1859, without prior notice,\r\nMoore and White absented themselves from the Comstock office, taking\r\nwith them as many of the books, accounts, records, and other assets of\r\nA.J. White & Co. as they could carry. Forthwith they established a\r\nbusiness of their own, also under the name of A.J. White & Co., at 10\r\nCourtlandt Street, where they resumed the manufacture and distribution\r\nof Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills, under a close facsimile of the label\r\nalready being used by the A.J. White-Comstock firm.\r\n\r\nThese events left the Comstocks in an embarrassing position. For over\r\nthree years they had been promoting the A.J. White trade name, but now\r\nthey could hardly keep a competitor from operating under his own name.\r\nTheir official attitude was that the old firm of A.J. White & Co. was\r\nstill in existence and controlled by the Comstocks. But shortly they\r\nconceded this point tacitly when they introduced new labels for the\r\nIndian Root Pills, under the name and signature of B. Lake Judson, and\r\nadvised that any accounts or correspondence with A.J. White & Co. still\r\noutstanding should be directed to the new firm of Judson.\r\n\r\nObviously, this state of affairs was extremely confusing to all of the\r\ncustomers. Judson traveled widely through the Canadian maritime\r\nprovinces and prevailed upon many merchants to disavow orders previously\r\ngiven to the new A.J. White firm at 10 Courtlandt Street. On April 28,\r\n1859, White and Moore, for their part, appointed one James Blakely of\r\nNapanee, Canada West, to represent them in the territory between\r\nKingston and Hamilton \"including all the back settlements,\" where he\r\nshould engage in the collection of all notes and receipts for the Indian\r\nRoot Pills and distribute new supplies to the merchants. On all\r\ncollections he was to receive 25 percent; new medicines were to be given\r\nout without charge except for freight. In his letter accepting the\r\nappointment, Blakely advised that:\r\n\r\n     I think the pills should be entered here so as to avoid part of the\r\n     enormous duty. 30% is too much to pay. I think there might be an\r\n     understanding so that it might be done with safety. Goods coming to\r\n     me should come by Oswego and from thence by Steamer to Millport. By\r\n     this route they would save the delay they would be subject to\r\n     coming by Kingston and avoid the scrutiny they would give them\r\n     there at the customhouse.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Moore claimed later (his affidavit of November 22, 1859)\r\nthat he thought he was hired only by White personally, and did not\r\nrealize that A.J. White & Co. was controlled by the Comstocks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 9.--\"To Purchasers of Dr. Morse's Indian Root\r\nPills\"--a warning by James Blakely, Canadian agent for A.J. White,\r\nagainst the \"counterfeit\" pills manufactured by the Comstock firm.]\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the notes and accounts which were assigned to Blakely\r\nfor collection were undoubtedly accounts originally established with the\r\nold A.J. White & Co. and therefore in dispute with the Comstocks. But in\r\nany case, Blakely went vigorously up and down his territory, frequently\r\ncrossing the paths of agents of the Comstocks, pushing the pills and\r\nattempting to collect outstanding bills owed to A.J. White & Co. by\r\npersuasion and threats. On July 2, 1860, he wrote that:\r\n\r\n     My sales have been pretty good. Comstock Pills are put in almost\r\n     every place, generally on commission at a low figure, but I get\r\n     them put aside in most cases and make actual sales so they will be\r\n     likely to get them back.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, back in New York City, the fight between the erstwhile\r\npartners went on, mostly in the legal arena. On April 14, 1859, the\r\nsheriff, at the instigation of the Comstocks, raided White's premises at\r\n10 Courtlandt Street and seized the books, accounts, and correspondence\r\ncarried away by White and Moore on January 1. Simultaneously, the\r\nComstocks succeeded in having White and Moore arrested on a charge of\r\nlarceny \"for stealing on last New Year's Day a large number of notes and\r\nreceipts,\" and in September White was arrested on a charge of forgery.\r\nSince the alleged offense took place in Pennsylvania, he was extradited\r\nback to that state. Neither the circumstances nor the disposition of\r\nthis case is known, but since White claimed the right to collect notes\r\nissued by the old A.J. White & Co., it is probable that the charge arose\r\nmerely out of his endorsement of some disputed note. On this occasion\r\nthe Comstocks printed and distributed circulars which were headed:\r\n\"Andrew J. White, the pill man indicted for forgery,\" and thereunder\r\nthey printed the requisition of the governor of New York in response to\r\nthe request for extradition from Pennsylvania, in such a way as to\r\nsuggest that their side of the dispute had official sanction.\r\n\r\nThe Comstocks must also have discovered White's and Blakely's\r\narrangement for avoiding \"scrutiny\" of their goods shipped into Canada,\r\nfor on July 29 there was an acknowledgment by the Collector of Customs\r\nof the Port of Queenston of certain information supplied by George Wells\r\nComstock, William Henry Comstock, and Baldwin L. Judson on goods being\r\n\"smuggled into this province.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the principal case between the Comstocks and White and Moore was\r\nscheduled for trial in December 1860, no documents which report its\r\noutcome were discovered. However, it is a fair surmise that the rival\r\nparties finally realized that they were spending a great deal of energy\r\nand money to little avail, injuring each other's business in the process\r\nand tarnishing the reputation of the Indian Root Pills regardless of\r\nownership. In any case, a final settlement of this protracted\r\ncontroversy was announced on March 26, 1861, when White and Moore\r\nrelinquished all claims and demands arising out of the sale of Dr.\r\nMorse's Indian Root Pills prior to January 1, 1859.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 10.--As one episode in the contest between the\r\nComstocks and White and Moore for control of the Indian Root Pills, the\r\nComstocks succeeded in having White indicted for forgery and briefly\r\nlodged in jail.]\r\n\r\nSince no copy of this agreement was found, we do not know what\r\ninducement was offered to Moore and White. However, hundreds of\r\nannouncements of the settlement, directed \"To the debtors of the late\r\nfirm of A.J. WHITE & CO.\" were printed, advising that\r\n\r\n     The controversy and the difficulties between the members of the old\r\n     firm of A.J. White & Co. of No. 50 Leonard Street, New York, being\r\n     ended, we hereby notify all parties to whom MORSE'S INDIAN ROOT\r\n     PILLS were sent or delivered prior to January 1, 1859, and all\r\n     parties holding for collection or otherwise, any of said claims or\r\n     demands for said Pills, that we the undersigned have forever\r\n     relinquished, and have now no claim, right, title or interest in\r\n     said debts or claims, and authorize the use of the names of said\r\n     firm whenever necessary in recovering, collecting and settling such\r\n     debts and claims.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was signed by Andrew J. White and Andrew B. Moore.\r\n\r\nThis should have been the end of this wearisome affair, but it was not.\r\nIt soon appeared that Moore had violated this agreement by concealing a\r\nnumber of accounts, together with a quantity of pills, circulars,\r\nlabels, and a set of plates, and, in the words of Comstock's complaint,\r\ntransferred them \"to James Blakely, an irresponsible person in Canada\r\nWest.\" And Blakely evidently continued to collect such accounts for the\r\nbenefit of himself and Moore. However, the Comstocks also entered the\r\nscene of strife, and sometime during the summer of 1862 William Henry\r\nComstock, then traveling in Ontario, collected a note in the amount of\r\n$7.50 in favor of A.J. White & Co., as he had every right to do, but\r\nendorsed it \"James Blakely for A.J. White & Co.\" Blakely, when he\r\nlearned of this, charged Comstock with forgery; Comstock in turn charged\r\nBlakely with libel. Comstock probably defended his somewhat questionable\r\nendorsement by the agreement of March 26 of the previous year; in any\r\nevent the case was dismissed by a Justice of the Peace in Ottawa without\r\ncomment. In New York City, on November 25, the Comstocks had Moore\r\narrested again, with White at this time testifying in their support.\r\nThere was also an attempt to prosecute Blakely in Canada; his defense\r\nwas that he had bought the disputed accounts and notes from Moore on\r\nMarch 11, 1861--a few days before the agreement with the Comstocks--and\r\nthat his ownership of these notes was thereafter absolute and he was no\r\nlonger working as an agent for Moore.\r\n\r\nThis controversy was still in the courts as late as April of 1864, and\r\nits final outcome is not known. But in any case, aside only from Moore's\r\nand Blakely's attempts to collect certain outstanding accounts and to\r\ndispose of stock still in their hands, the agreement of March 26, 1861,\r\nleft the Comstocks in full and undisputed possession of Dr. Morse's\r\nIndian Root Pills. White thereafter continued in the patent-medicine\r\nbusiness in New York City on his own; his firm was still active as\r\nrecently as 1914. The subsequent history of Moore is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Brothers Part Company*\r\n\r\nOne would imagine that the three partners of Comstock & Brother would\r\nhave been exhausted by litigation and would be eager to work amicably\r\ntogether for years. But such was not to be the case. The recovered\r\nrecords give notice of a lawsuit (1866) between George Comstock on the\r\none hand and William H. Comstock and Judson on the other. No other\r\ndocuments relating to this case were found, and thus the precise issue\r\nis not known, or how it was finally settled. However, it was obviously a\r\nprelude to the dissolution of the old firm.\r\n\r\nLetters and documents from the several years preceding this event\r\nsuggest that Judson had become more prominent in the business, and that\r\nhe and William H. Comstock had gradually been drawing closer together,\r\nperhaps in opposition to George. Judson, although a partner of Comstock\r\n& Brother, also operated under his own name at 50 Leonard Street and had\r\noriginated several of the medicines himself. It is not clear whether the\r\nold firm of Comstock & Brother was formally dissolved, but after 1864\r\ninsurance policies and other documents referred to the premises as\r\n\"Comstock & Judson.\" In 1863 the federal internal revenue license in\r\nconnection with the new \"temporary\" Civil War tax on the manufacturing\r\nof drugs[6] was issued simply to B.L. Judson & Co., now located, with\r\nthe Comstocks, at 106 Franklin Street.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The \"temporary\" tax placed upon drug manufacture as a\r\nrevenue measure during the Civil War remained in effect until 1883.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 11.--This announcement, sent to all customers of\r\nthe Indian Root Pills, marked the final termination of the long dispute\r\nbetween two firms, both named A.J. White & Co., and both of whom claimed\r\nownership of the pills.]\r\n\r\nDuring this period Judson and William Henry Comstock became interested\r\nin a coffee-roasting and spice-grinding business, operated under the\r\nname of Central Mills, and located in the Harlem Railroad Building at\r\nthe corner of Centre and White Streets. Possibly George objected to his\r\npartners spreading their energies over a second business; in any case,\r\ndissension must have arisen over some matter. On April 1, 1866, balance\r\nsheets were drawn up separately for B.L. Judson & Co. and Comstock &\r\nJudson; the former showed a net worth of $48,527.56 against only\r\n$5,066.70 for the latter. Both of these firms had a common bookkeeper,\r\nE. Kingsland, but the relationship between the firms is not known.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, Judson and William H. Comstock sold their coffee-roasting\r\nbusiness to one Alexander Chegwidden, taking a mortgage on the specific\r\nassets, which included, besides roasters and other machinery, a horse\r\nand wagon. But if this had been a factor in the controversy among the\r\npartners, the sale failed to end it, for we find that on December 21,\r\n1866, George W. obtained an injunction against William Henry and Judson\r\nrestraining them from collecting or receiving any accounts due the\r\npartnership of B.L. Judson & Co., transferring or disposing of any of\r\nits assets, and continuing business under that name or using any of its\r\ntrademarks. Unfortunately, we have no information as to the details of\r\nthis case or the terms of settlement, but we do find that on February 1,\r\n1867, the law firm of Townsend, Dyett & Morrison rendered a bill for\r\n$538.85 to B.L. Judson and William H. Comstock for \"Supervising and\r\nengrossing two copies of agreement with George W. Comstock on\r\nsettlement\" and for representing the two parties named in several\r\nactions and cross actions with George.\r\n\r\nThis settlement, whatever its precise character may have been, obviously\r\nmarked the termination of the old partnership--or, more properly, the\r\nseries of successor partnerships--that had been carried on by various of\r\nthe Comstock brothers for over thirty years. William Henry, the former\r\nclerk and junior partner--although also the son of the founder--was now\r\ngoing it alone. Before this time he had already transferred the main\r\ncenter of his activities to Canada, and he must have been contemplating\r\nthe removal of the business out of New York City.\r\n\r\nAfter this parting of the ways, George W. Comstock was associated with\r\nseveral machinery businesses in New York City, up until his death in\r\n1889. During the Draft Riots of 1863 he had played an active role in\r\nprotecting refugees from the Colored orphanage on 43rd Street, who\r\nsought asylum in his house at 136 West 34th Street.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n*Dr. Morse's Pills Move to Morristown*\r\n\r\nIn April 1867, the home of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and of the\r\nother proprietary remedies was transferred from New York City to\r\nMorristown, a village of 300 inhabitants on the bank of the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver in northern New York State. This was not, however, the initial\r\nmove into this area; three or four years earlier William H. Comstock had\r\ntaken over an existing business in Brockville, Ontario, directly across\r\nthe river. No specific information as to why the business was\r\nestablished here has been found, but the surrounding circumstances\r\nprovide some very good presumptions.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the Comstocks' business was always carried on in rural\r\nareas--in \"the back-woods.\" Specifically, the best sales territory\r\nconsisted of the Middle West--what was then regarded as \"The West\"--of\r\nthe United States and of Canada West, i.e., the present province of\r\nOntario. A surviving ledger of all of the customers of Comstock &\r\nBrother in 1857 supplies a complete geographic distribution. Although\r\nNew Jersey and Pennsylvania were fairly well represented, accounts in\r\nNew York State were sparse, and those in New England negligible. And\r\ndespite considerable travel by the partners or agents in the Maritime\r\nProvinces, no very substantial business was ever developed there. The\r\nreal lively sales territory consisted of the six states of Ohio,\r\nIndiana,\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _National Cyclopedia of American Biography_, IV:500.]\r\n\r\nIllinois, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Iowa, which accounted for over two\r\nthirds of all domestic sales, while Canada West contributed over 90\r\npercent of Canadian sales. More regular customers were to be found in\r\nCanada West--a relatively compact territory--than any other single state\r\nor province. The number of customers of Comstock & Brother in 1857 by\r\nstates and provinces follows:\r\n\r\nAlabama                12\r\nArkansas                1\r\nConnecticut             3\r\nDelaware                5\r\nD.C.                    1\r\nFlorida                 5\r\nGeorgia                15\r\nIllinois              415\r\nIndiana               298\r\nIowa                  179\r\nKansas Ter.             1\r\nKentucky               21\r\nLouisiana               7\r\nMaine                   2\r\nMaryland               21\r\nMassachusetts           5\r\nMinnesota Ter.          6\r\nMississippi             8\r\nMissouri               32\r\nMichigan              194\r\nNew York State         88\r\nNew York City           3\r\nNew Jersey            212\r\nNew Hampshire           1\r\nNorth Carolina          9\r\nOhio                  179\r\nPennsylvania          192\r\nRhode Island            2\r\nSouth Carolina          5\r\nTennessee              21\r\nTexas                   1\r\nVirginia               30\r\nWisconsin             303\r\nNew Brunswick          15\r\nNova Scotia            19\r\nCanada East (Quebec)    7\r\nCanada West           434\r\n\r\nTotal United States 2,277\r\nTotal Canada          475\r\n\r\nThe concentration of this market and its considerable distance from New\r\nYork City at a time when transportation conditions were still relatively\r\nprimitive must have created many problems in distribution. Moreover, the\r\nserious threat to the important Canadian market imposed by White and\r\nMoore, although eventually settled by compromise, must have emphasized\r\nthe vulnerability of this territory to competition.\r\n\r\nIt was also probable that the office in lower Manhattan--at 106 Franklin\r\nStreet after May 20, 1862--was found to be increasingly congested and\r\ninconvenient as a site for mixing pills and tonics, bottling, labeling,\r\npackaging and shipping them, and keeping all of the records for a large\r\nnumber of individual small accounts. A removal of the manufacturing part\r\nof the business to more commodious quarters, adjacent to transportation\r\nroutes, must have been urgent.\r\n\r\nBut why move to as remote a place as Morristown, New York, beyond the\r\nthen still wild Adirondacks? It is obvious that this location was\r\nselected because the company already had an office and some facilities\r\nin Brockville, Canada West.\r\n\r\nWilliam H. Comstock must have first become established at Brockville,\r\nafter extensive peregrinations through Canada West, around 1859 or 1860.\r\nDuring the dispute between A.J. White and Comstock & Judson, Blakely,\r\nthe aggressive Canadian agent, had written to White, on September 1,\r\n1859, that he had heard from \"Mr. Allen Turner of Brockville\" that the\r\nComstocks were already manufacturing Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills at\r\nSt. Catherines. Evidently the Comstocks thought of several possible\r\nlocations, for on July 2 of the following year Blakely advised his\r\nprincipals that the Comstocks were now manufacturing their pills in\r\nBrockville. Two years later, in November 1862, when Blakely sued William\r\nH. Comstock for the forgery of a note, the defendant was then described\r\nin the legal papers as \"one Wm. Henry Comstock of the town of Brockville\r\nDruggist.\" And in July 1865, Comstock was writing from Brockville to E.\r\nKingsland, the bookkeeper in New York City, telling him to put\r\nBrenner--the bearer of the letter--\"in the mill.\" Comstock had\r\napparently taken over an existing business in Brockville, as receipts\r\nfor medicines delivered by him describe him as \"Successor to A.N.\r\nM'Donald & Co.\" Dr. McKenzie's Worm Tablets also seem to have come into\r\nthe Comstock business with this acquisition.\r\n\r\nThis did not mean a final move to Brockville for William H. Comstock;\r\nfor several years he must have gone back and forth and was still active\r\nin New York City as a partner of his brother and of Judson. We have seen\r\nthat he subsequently went into partnership with Judson in the purchase\r\nof the coffee-roasting business. In December 1866, he was a defendant in\r\nthe lawsuit initiated by his brother George, when he was still\r\napparently active in the New York City business. Nevertheless, he\r\napparently shifted the center of his activities to the Brockville area\r\nabout 1860, relinquishing primary responsibility for affairs in New York\r\nCity to his brother and to Judson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 12.--Label for Victoria Hair Gloss, Comstock &\r\nBrother, 1855.]\r\n\r\nWe now find the Comstock business established at Brockville. Exactly why\r\na second plant was built at Morristown, right across the river, is again\r\na matter for conjecture. It is a fair assumption, however, that customs\r\nduties or other restraints may have interfered with the ability of the\r\nCanadian plant to supply the United States market. Thus, facilities on\r\nthe other side of the border, but still close enough to be under common\r\nmanagement, must have become essential. In an era of water\r\ntransportation, Morristown was a convenient place from which to supply\r\nthe important middle western territory. Ogdensburg was the eastern\r\nterminus of lake boats, and several lines provided daily service between\r\nthat point and Buffalo. The railroad had already reached Ogdensburg\r\n(although not yet Morristown) so that rail transportation was also\r\nconvenient. And the farms of St. Lawrence County could certainly be\r\ncounted upon to supply such labor as was necessary for the rather simple\r\ntasks of mixing pills and elixirs and packaging them. Finally, the two\r\nplants were directly across the river from each other--connection was\r\nmade by a ferry which on the New York side docked almost on the Comstock\r\nproperty--so that both could easily be supervised by a single manager.\r\nIn fact, if it had not been for the unusual circumstance that they were\r\nlocated in two different countries, they could really have been\r\nconsidered as no more than separate buildings constituting a single\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nSurviving receipts for various goods and services show that the move to\r\nMorristown was carried out in March or April of 1867. Although the\r\nMorristown undertaking was obviously regarded as a continuation of the\r\nNew York business, it was operated by William Henry Comstock as the sole\r\nproprietor for many years, and the terms of any settlement or subsequent\r\nrelationship with Judson are unknown. A \"Judson Pill Co.\" was\r\nsubsequently established at Morristown, but this was no more than a\r\nmailing address for one department of the Comstock business. What\r\nhappened to Judson as an individual is a mystery; like Moore, he quietly\r\ndisappears from our story.\r\n\r\nIt is also puzzling that no record of the transfer of land to Mr.\r\nComstock upon the first establishment of the pill factory in Morristown\r\nin 1867 can be found. The earliest deed discovered in the St. Lawrence\r\nCounty records shows the transfer of waterfront property to William\r\nHenry Comstock \"of Brockville, Ontario,\" from members of the Chapman\r\nfamily, in March 1876. Additional adjoining land was also acquired in\r\n1877 and 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Golden Era*\r\n\r\nWith the establishment of the Comstock patent-medicine business at\r\nMorristown in 1867, this enterprise may be said to have reached\r\nmaturity. Over thirty years had passed since William Henry's father had\r\nestablished its earliest predecessor in lower Manhattan. Possession of\r\nDr. Morse's Indian Root Pills was now unchallenged, and this and the\r\nother leading brand names were recognized widely in country drug stores\r\nand farmhouses over one third of a continent. No longer did the\r\nmedicines have to be mixed, bottled, and packaged in cramped and dingy\r\nquarters above a city shop; spacious buildings in an uncongested country\r\nvillage were now being used. No further relocations would be necessary,\r\nas operations exceeded their capacity, or as landlords might elect to\r\nraise rents; the pill factory was to remain on the same site for the\r\nfollowing ninety years. And the bitter struggles for control, perhaps\r\nacerbated because of the family relationship among the partners, were\r\nnow a thing of the past. William H. Comstock was in exclusive control,\r\nand he was to retain this position, first as sole proprietor and later\r\nas president, for the remainder of his long life.\r\n\r\nThe patent-medicine business as a whole was also entering, just at this\r\ntime, upon its golden era--the fifty-year span between the Civil War and\r\nWorld War I. Improved transportation, wider circulation of newspapers\r\nand periodicals, and cheaper and better bottles all enabled the\r\nmanufacturers of the proprietary remedies to expand distribution--the\r\nenactment and enforcement of federal drug laws was still more than a\r\ngeneration in the future. So patent medicines flourished; in hundreds of\r\ncities and villages over the land enterprising self-proclaimed druggists\r\ndevised a livelihood for themselves by mixing some powders into pills or\r\nbottling some secret elixir--normally containing a high alcoholic\r\ncontent or some other habit-forming element--created some kind of a\r\nlegend about this concoction, and sold the nostrum as the infallible\r\ncure for a wide variety of human (and animal) ailments. And many\r\nconservative old ladies, each one of them a pillar of the church and an\r\nuncompromising foe of liquor, cherished their favorite remedies to\r\nprovide comfort during the long winter evenings. But of these myriads of\r\npatent-medicine manufacturers, only a scant few achieved the size, the\r\nrecognition, and wide distribution of Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and\r\nthe other leading Comstock remedies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 13.--Comstock factory buildings, about 1900.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 14.--Wrapper for Longley's Great Western Panacea.]\r\n\r\nOf course, the continued growth of the business was a gradual process;\r\nit did not come all at once with the move to Morristown. Even in 1878,\r\nafter eleven years in this village, the Comstock factory was not yet\r\nimportant enough to obtain mention in Everts' comprehensive _History of\r\nSt. Lawrence County_.[8] But, as we have seen, additional land was\r\npurchased in 1877 and 1882, obviously bespeaking an expansion of the\r\nenterprise. In 1885, according to a time book, the pill factory\r\nregularly employed about thirty persons, plus a few others on an\r\noccasional basis.\r\n\r\nMr. Comstock, from his residence across the river in Brockville, was the\r\nmanager of the business; however, the operations were under the\r\nimmediate charge of E. Kingsland, former chief clerk of the Judson and\r\nComstock offices in New York City, who was brought up to Morristown as\r\nsuperintendent of the factory. E. Kingsland was a cousin of Edward A.\r\nKingsland, one of the leading stationers in New York City, and\r\npresumably because of this relationship, Kingsland supplied a large part\r\nof Comstock's stationery requirements for many years. Kingsland in\r\nMorristown retired from the plant in 1885 and was succeeded by Robert G.\r\nNicolson, who had been a foreman for a number of years. Nicolson, a\r\nnative of Glasgow, Scotland, was brought to America as a child, first\r\nlived at Brockville, and then came to Morristown as foreman in the pill\r\nfactory shortly after it was established. He was succeeded as\r\nsuperintendent by his own son, Robert Jr., early in the present century.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the employees of the pill factory were women--or,\r\nmore properly, girls--in an era when it was not yet common-place for\r\nmembers of the fair sex to leave the shelter of their homes for paid\r\nemployment. The wage rates during the 1870s, 1880s and 1890s were $3 to\r\n$5 a week for girls and $7 to $12 a week for men; the last-named amount\r\nwas an acceptable rate at that time for a permanent and experienced\r\nadult man. The factory management of this era was joyously unaware of\r\nminimum wages, fair employment laws, social security, antidiscrimination\r\nrequirements, fair trade, food and drug acts, income taxes, and the\r\nremaining panoply of legal restrictions that harass the modern\r\nbusinessman. Since only a few scattered payroll records have been\r\nrecovered, Comstock's maximum employment during the Morristown period is\r\nnot known, or just when it was reached. In a brief sketch of the Indian\r\nRoot Pill business, however, Mrs. Doris Planty, former Morristown town\r\nhistorian, mentions a work force of from \"40 to 50\" around the turn of\r\nthe century.\r\n\r\nIn 1875, twenty years after its original projection, the Utica & Black\r\nRiver Railroad finally came through the village, bisecting the Comstock\r\nproperty with a right-of-way thirty-six feet wide and dividing it\r\nthereafter into a \"lower shop,\" where the pills and tonics were made,\r\nand the \"upper shop,\" where the medicines were packaged and clerical\r\nduties performed. The superintendent and his family lived above the\r\nupper shop in an apartment; it was in the spacious attic above this\r\napartment that the records of the business, in a scattered and ransacked\r\ncondition, were found. Inasmuch as the first recorded sale of land to\r\nComstock occurred in March 1876, almost simultaneously with the arrival\r\nof the railroad, it is a fair surmise that the second building was put\r\nup about this time.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the railroad also put a station almost at the doorstep of\r\nthe factory, and thereafter many shipments came and went by rail. The\r\ncompany's huge volume of mailings, often ten or fifteen bags a day, was\r\nalso delivered directly to the trains, without going through the local\r\npost office. For some years, however, heavy shipments, including coal\r\nfor the factory's boilers, continued to come by ship. The Brockville\r\nferry also operated from a dock immediately adjacent to the railroad\r\nstation; one end of the station was occupied by the United States\r\nCustoms House.\r\n\r\nAlmost from the time of its arrival in Morristown, the Black River\r\nRailroad operated a daily through Wagner Palace Sleeping Car from New\r\nYork City via Utica and Carthage, and service over the same route was\r\ncontinued by the New York Central after it took over the North Country\r\nrailroads in 1891. This meant that Mr. Comstock, when he had business in\r\nNew York City, could linger in his factory until the evening train\r\npaused at the station to load the afternoon's outpouring of pills and\r\nalmanacs, swing aboard the waiting Pullman, and ensconce himself\r\ncomfortably in his berth, to awaken in the morning within the cavernous\r\nprecincts of Grand Central Station--an ease and convenience of travel\r\nwhich residents of the North Country in the 1970s cannot help but envy.\r\nThe daily sleeping car through Morristown to and from New York City\r\nsurvived as long as the railroad itself, into the early 1960s, thus\r\noutlasting both of the Comstocks--father and son.\r\n\r\n[Footnotes 8: Or perhaps Mr. Comstock merely failed to pay for an\r\nengraved plate and to order a book; these county histories were\r\napparently very largely written and edited with an eye to their\r\nsubscribers.]\r\n\r\nThe pills were originally mixed by hand. In the summer of 1880 the\r\nfactory installed a steam engine and belt-driven pill-mixing machinery.\r\nAt least one rotary pill machine was purchased from England, from J.W.\r\nPindar, and delivered to Comstock at a total cost (including ocean\r\nfreight) of £19-10-9--about $100. One minor unsolved mystery is that a\r\nbill for a second, identical machine made out to A.J. White--with whom\r\nComstock had not been associated for twenty years--is filed among the\r\nComstock records; it can only be surmised that at this time Comstock and\r\nWhite were again on good terms, the memories of lawsuits, arrests, and\r\nprosecutions long since forgotten, and Comstock either ordered a machine\r\nin behalf of White or perhaps agreed to take one off his hands. At the\r\ntime of this expansion, certain outbuildings and a dock for the\r\nunloading of coal were erected adjoining the lower building. During 1881\r\nan underwater telegraph cable was laid between Morristown and\r\nBrockville, allowing immediate communication between the two Comstock\r\nfactories.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the electrical age, around the turn of the century,\r\nthe Comstock factory also installed a generator to supply lighting, the\r\nfirst in the locality to introduce this amenity. The wires were also\r\nextended to the four or five company-owned houses in the village, and\r\nthen to other houses, so that the company functioned as a miniature\r\npublic utility. Its electric lines in the village were eventually sold\r\nto the Central New York Power Corporation and incorporated into that\r\nsystem. Steam heat was also supplied to the railroad station and the\r\ncustoms house, and the company pumped water out of the river to the\r\nwater tower on the hill above Pine Hill Cemetery, following the\r\ninstallation of the public water system.\r\n\r\nIn 1908, Comstock built a large hotel across the street from the upper\r\nfactory; sitting part way up the hill and surrounded by a wide veranda,\r\nit represented a conspicuous feature in the village and dominated the\r\nwaterfront scene until its destruction by fire in 1925. The Comstock\r\nfamily, in 1910, also built a town hall and social center for the\r\nvillage. Adjacent to the lower shop a large boathouse was erected to\r\nshelter Mr. Comstock's yacht, the _Maga Doma_, a familiar sight on the\r\nriver for many years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 15.--The village of Morristown from the waterfront.\r\nRailroad depot, Comstock Hotel, and pill-factory buildings located left\r\nof center.]\r\n\r\nIn any large city, of course, a factory employing, at most, forty or\r\nfifty workers would have passed unnoticed, and its owner could hardly\r\nexpect to wield any great social or political influence. In a remote\r\nvillage like Morristown, things are quite different; a regular employer\r\nof forty persons creates a considerable economic impact. For two\r\ngenerations the Indian Root Pill factory supplied jobs, in an area where\r\nthey were always scarce, and at a time when the old forest and dairy\r\nindustries were already beginning to decline. But the recital of its\r\nclose associations with the village makes it clear that the pill factory\r\nwas more than a mere employer; for ninety years it provided a spirit\r\nthat animated Morristown, pioneered in the introduction of utilities and\r\ncertain social services, linked the village directly with the great\r\noutside world of drug stores and hypochondriacs, and distinguished it\r\nsharply from other, languishing St. Lawrence County villages. One may\r\nwonder whether Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills really did anyone any good.\r\nThey certainly did heap many benefits upon all citizens of Morristown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 16.--Depot, Comstock Hotel, and factory buildings\r\n(at right), about 1910.]\r\n\r\nWhile there was only a single Comstock medicine business, operated as a\r\nsole proprietorship until 1902, Comstock found it convenient to maintain\r\nseveral dummy companies--really no more than mailing addresses--for some\r\nyears after the move to the North. Thus, in Morristown was to be found,\r\nat least in business and postal directories, besides the Comstock\r\ncompany itself, two other proprietary manufacturers: Judson Pill Co. and\r\nE. Kingsland & Co.\r\n\r\nThe Judson Pill Co. preserved the name of Comstock's former partner,\r\nwhile use of the name E. Kingsland perhaps flattered the vanity of the\r\nformer chief clerk and later plant superintendent. The major Kingsland\r\nproduct was Chlorinated Tablets, a sure cure for coughs, colds,\r\nhoarseness, bronchial irritation, influenza, diphtheria, croup, sore\r\nthroat and all throat diseases; these were especially recommended by Dr.\r\nMacKenzie, Senior Physician in the Hospital for Diseases of the Throat\r\n(was there any such hospital?) in London, England. The Kingsland pills\r\nwere also popularized under the name of Little Pink Granules.\r\n\r\nOver on the Canadian side of the river, where another plant\r\napproximately the same size as the Morristown facilities was in\r\noperation, the Comstock Company had assimilated the Dr. Howard Medicine\r\nCo. Dr. Howard's leading remedies were his Seven Spices for all\r\nDigestive Disorders and the Blood Builder for Brain and Body. The\r\nlatter, in the form of pills, was prescribed as a positive cure for a\r\nwide array of ailments, but like many other patent medicines of the\r\nera, it was hinted that it had a particularly beneficial effect upon\r\nsexual vitality.\r\n\r\n     They have an especial action (through the blood) upon the SEXUAL\r\n     ORGANS of both Men and Women. It is a well recognized fact that\r\n     upon the healthy activity of the sexual apparatus depend the mental\r\n     and physical well-being of every person come to adult years. It is\r\n     that which gives the rosy blush to the cheek, and the soft light to\r\n     the eye of the maiden. The elastic step, the ringing laugh, and the\r\n     strong right arm of the youth, own the same mainspring. How soon do\r\n     irregularities rob the face of color, the eye of brightness!\r\n     Everyone knows this. The blood becomes impoverished, the victim\r\n     PALE. This pallor of the skin is often the outward mark of the\r\n     trouble within. But to the sufferer there arise a host of symptoms,\r\n     chiefest among which are loss of physical and nervous energy. Then\r\n     Dr. Howard's BLOOD BUILDER steps into the breach and holds the\r\n     fort. The impoverished Blood is enriched. The shattered nervous\r\n     forces are restored. Vigor returns. Youth is recalled. Decay\r\n     routed. The bloom of health again mantles the faded cheek.\r\n     Improvement follows a few days' use of the pills; while permanent\r\n     benefit and cure can only reasonably be expected when sufficient\r\n     have been taken to enrich the Blood.\r\n\r\nBefore the Blood Builder pills were taken, all their users were advised\r\nto have their bowels thoroughly cleansed by a laxative medicine and,\r\nhappily, the company also made an excellent preparation for this\r\npurpose--Dr. Howard's Golden Grains. While the good doctor was modern\r\nenough--the circular quoted from was printed in the 1890s--to recognize\r\nthe importance of the healthy activity of the sexual apparatus, such a\r\nsuggestion should not be carried too far--so we find that the pills were\r\nalso unrivaled for building up systems shattered by debauchery,\r\nexcesses, self-abuse or disease. Along with the pills themselves was\r\nrecommended a somewhat hardy regimen, including fresh air, adequate\r\nsleep, avoidance of lascivious thoughts, and bathing the private parts\r\nand buttocks twice daily in ice-cold water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 17.--Card used in advertising Kingsland's\r\nChlorinated Tablets.]\r\n\r\nA few years after their initial introduction, Dr. Howard's Blood Builder\r\nPills somehow became \"electric\"--this word surrounded by jagged arrows\r\nprominently featured on the outer wrapper--although the character of the\r\nimprovement which added this new quality was not explained anywhere. The\r\nliterature accompanying these remedies explained that \"in the evening of\r\nan active, earnest and successful life, and in order that the public at\r\nlarge might participate in the benefit of his discoveries,\" Dr. Howard\r\ngraciously imparted to the proprietors the composition, methods of\r\npreparation, and modes of using these medicines. In other words, he was\r\nobviously a public benefactor of the same stamp as Dr. Morse and Dr.\r\nCunard--although by the final years of the century, the old story about\r\nthe long absence from home, the extended travels in remote lands, and\r\nthe sudden discovery of some remarkable native remedy would probably\r\nhave sounded a trifle implausible.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Putting the Pills Through*\r\n\r\nGiven the characteristics of the patent-medicine business, its most\r\ndifficult and essential function was selling--or what the Comstocks and\r\ntheir representatives frequently described in their letters as \"putting\r\nthe pills through.\" During the full century within which Dr. Morse's\r\nIndian Root Pills and their companion remedies were distributed widely\r\nover North America and, later, over the entire world, almost every form\r\nof advertising and publicity was utilized. And it is a strong\r\npresumption that the total costs of printing and publicity were much\r\nlarger than those of manufacture and packaging.\r\n\r\nInitially, the selling was done largely by \"travelers\" calling directly\r\nupon druggists and merchants, especially those in rural communities. All\r\nof the Comstock brothers, with the exception perhaps of Lucius, seem to\r\nhave traveled a large part of their time, covering the country from the\r\nMaritime Provinces to the Mississippi Valley, and from Ontario--or\r\nCanada West--to the Gulf. Their letters to the \"home office\" show that\r\nthey were frequently absent for extended periods, visiting points which\r\nat the very dawn of the railroad era, in the 1840s and 1850s, must have\r\nbeen remote indeed. In the surviving letters we find occasional\r\nreferences to lame horses and other vicissitudes of travel, and one can\r\nalso imagine the rigors of primitive trains, lake and river steamers,\r\nstagecoaches, and rented carriages, not to mention ill-prepared meals\r\nand dingy hotel rooms.\r\n\r\nJudson seems to have handled Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. J. Carlton\r\nComstock, who died in 1853, covered the South and in fact maintained a\r\nresidence in New Orleans; prior to the opening of the railroads, this\r\ncity was also a point of entry for much of the West. George Wells\r\nComstock made several extensive tours of the West, while William Henry\r\nspent much of his time in Canada West and, as we have seen, lived in\r\nBrockville after 1860. Andrew J. White spent most of his time traveling\r\nafter he joined the firm in 1855; Moore also covered Canada West\r\nintensively, briefly for the Comstocks and then in opposition to them.\r\n\r\nBesides the partners themselves, the several successor Comstock firms\r\nhad numerous agents and representatives. As early as 1851, during the\r\ndispute between Lucius and his brothers, it was stated in a legal brief\r\nthat the partnership included, besides its manufacturing house in New\r\nYork City, several hundred agencies and depots throughout every state\r\nand county in the Union. This assertion may have stretched the truth a\r\nbit, as most of the agents must have handled other products as well, but\r\nthe distribution system for the pills was undoubtedly well organized and\r\nwidely extended. Several full-time agents did work exclusively for the\r\nComstocks; these included Henry S. Grew of St. John's, Canada East, who\r\nsaid he had traveled 20,000 miles in three years prior to 1853, and\r\nWillard P. Morse in the Middle West, whose signature is still extant on\r\nnumerous shipping documents.\r\n\r\nWhile personal salemanship always must have been most effective in\r\npushing the pills--and also useful in the allied task of collecting\r\ndelinquent accounts--as the business grew the territory was far too vast\r\nto be covered by travelers, and so advertising was also used heavily.\r\nHardly any method was neglected, but emphasis was always placed upon two\r\nmedia: almanacs and country newspapers.\r\n\r\nMillions of the almanacs poured out of the small Morristown railroad\r\nstation. In the early years of the present century, for which the record\r\nhas been found, from July until the following April shipments of\r\nalmanacs usually ran well in excess of one million per month. At various\r\ntimes they were also printed in Spanish and in German; the Spanish\r\nversion was for export, but the German was intended primarily for our\r\nown \"native\" Germans in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and elsewhere\r\nthroughout the Middle West.\r\n\r\nAround the turn of the century, the patent-medicine almanac was so\r\ncommon that one could walk into any drug store and pick up three or four\r\nof them. Credit for the origination of the free patent-medicine almanac\r\nhas been ascribed to Cyrenius C. Bristol, founder of the firm which\r\nMoore later took over and therefore an indirect predecessor of the\r\nIndian Root Pills. Whether or not this is strictly accurate, it is known\r\nthat Bristol's Sarsaparilla Almanac was being printed as early as 1843\r\nand by 1848 had expanded into an edition of 64 pages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 18.--German circular for Judson's Mountain Herb\r\nPills.]\r\n\r\nThe Comstocks were almost as early. The first date they printed almanacs\r\nis not known, but by 1853 it was a regular practice, for the order book\r\nof that year shows that large batches of almanacs, frequently 500\r\ncopies, were routinely enclosed with every substantial order. Over their\r\nentire history it is quite reasonable that somewhere in the vicinity of\r\none billion almanacs must have been distributed by the Comstock Company\r\nand its predecessors. As a matter of fact, back in the 1850s there was\r\nnot merely a Comstock but also a Judson almanac. One version of the\r\nlatter was the \"Rescue of Tula,\" which recounted Dr. Cunard's rescue of\r\nthe Aztec princess and his reward in the form of the secret of the\r\nMountain Herb Pills. In the 1880s, Morse's Indian Root Pill almanac was\r\na 34-page pamphlet, about two thirds filled with advertising and\r\ntestimonials--including the familiar story of the illness of Dr. Morse's\r\nfather and the dramatic return of his son with the life-saving\r\nherbs--but also containing calendars, astronomical data, and some homely\r\ngood advice. Odd corners were filled with jokes, of which the following\r\nwas a typical specimen:\r\n\r\n     \"Pa,\" said a lad to his father, \"I have often read of people poor\r\n     but honest; why don't they sometimes say, 'rich but honest'\"?\r\n\r\n     \"Tut, tut, my son, nobody would believe them,\" answered the father.\r\n\r\nBefore 1900 the detailed story of the discovery of Dr. Morse's pills was\r\nabridged to a brief summary, and during the 1920s this tale was\r\nabandoned altogether, although until the end the principal ingredients\r\nwere still identified as natural herbs and roots used as a remedy by the\r\nIndians. In more recent years the character and purpose of Dr. Morse's\r\npills also changed substantially. As recently as 1918, years after the\r\npassage of the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906, they were still being\r\nrecommended as a cure for:\r\n\r\nBiliousness\r\nDyspepsia\r\nConstipation\r\nSick Headache\r\nScrofula\r\nKidney Disease\r\nLiver Complaint\r\nJaundice\r\nPiles\r\nDysentery\r\nColds\r\nBoils\r\nMalarial Fever\r\nFlatulency\r\nFoul Breath\r\nEczema\r\nGravel\r\nWorms\r\nFemale Complaints\r\nRheumatism\r\nNeuralgia\r\nLa Grippe\r\nPalpitation\r\nNervousness\r\n\r\nFurther, two entire pages were taken in the almanac to explain how, on\r\nthe authority of \"the celebrated Prof. La Roche of Paris,\" appendicitis\r\ncould be cured by the pills without resort to the surgeon's knife.\r\n\r\nBesides the almanacs, almost every known form of advertising in the\r\npreradio era was employed. Announcements were inserted in\r\nnewspapers--apparently mostly rural newspapers--all over the country;\r\nthe two remedies pushed most intensively were the Indian Root Pills and\r\nJudson's Mountain Herb Worm Tea. The latter always bore a true likeness\r\nof Tezuco, the Aztec chief who had originally conferred the secret of\r\nthe medicine upon Dr. Cunard. Besides the Mountain Herb Worm Tea, there\r\nwere also Mountain Herb Pills; it is not clear how the pills differed\r\nfrom the tea, but they were recommended primarily as a remedy for\r\n\r\nDiarrhoea Dropsy Debility Fever and Ague Female Complaints Headaches\r\nIndigestion Influenza Inflammation Inward Weakness Liver Complaints\r\nLowness of Spirits Piles Stone and Gravel Secondary Symptoms\r\n\r\nwith particular stress upon their value as a \"great female medicine.\"\r\nBesides the major advertisement of the pills, consisting of an\r\neight-inch column to be printed in each issue of the paper, smaller\r\nannouncements were provided, to be inserted according to a specified\r\nmonthly schedule among the editorial matter on the inside pages. Sample\r\nmonthly announcements from the Judson Mountain Herb Pills contract used\r\nin 1860 were:\r\n\r\n\r\n     JANUARY\r\n\r\n     THE GREAT FEMALE MEDICINE\r\n\r\n     The functional irregularities peculiar to the weaker sex, are\r\n     invariably corrected without pain or inconvenience by the use of\r\n     Judson's Mountain Herb Pills. They are the safest and surest\r\n     medicine for all the diseases incidental to females of all ages,\r\n     and more especially so in this climate.\r\n\r\n     Ladies who wish to enjoy health should always have these Pills. No\r\n     one who ever uses them once will ever allow herself to be without\r\n     them. They remove all obstructions, purify the blood and give to\r\n     the skin that beautiful, clear and healthful look so greatly\r\n     admired in a beautiful and healthy woman. At certain periods these\r\n     Pills are an indispensable companion. From one to four should be\r\n     taken each day, until relief is obtained. A few doses occasionally,\r\n     will keep the system healthy, and the blood so pure, that diseases\r\n     cannot enter the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n     MARCH\r\n\r\n     DISEASES OF THE CHEST AND LUNGS\r\n\r\n     These diseases are too well known to require any description. How\r\n     many thousands are every year carried to the silent grave by that\r\n     dread scourge Consumption, which always commences with a slight\r\n     cough. Keep  the blood pure and healthy by taking a few doses of\r\n     JUDSON'S MOUNTAIN HERB PILLS each week, and disease of any kind is\r\n     impossible. Consumption and lung difficulties always arise from\r\n     particles of corrupt matter deposited in the air cells by bad\r\n     blood. Purify that stream of life and it will soon carry off and\r\n     destroy the poisonous matter; and like a crystal river flowing\r\n     through a desert, will bring with it and leave throughout the body\r\n     the elements of health and strength. As the river leaving the\r\n     elements of fertility in its course, causes the before barren waste\r\n     to bloom with flowers and fruit, so pure blood causes the frame to\r\n     rejoice in strength and health, and bloom with unfading beauty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 19.--Card used in advertising Judson's Mountain\r\nHerb Pills.]\r\n\r\nAny person who read the notices for both medicines carefully might have\r\nnoticed with some surprise that the Mountain Herb Pills and the Indian\r\nRoot Pills were somehow often recommended for many of the same diseases.\r\nIn fact, the Mountain Herb Pills and the Indian Root Pills used\r\nidentical text in explaining their effect upon several disagreeable\r\nconditions. Always prominent in this advertising were reminders of our\r\nfragile mortality and warnings, if proper medication were neglected, of\r\nan untimely consignment to the silent grave.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, newspapers in the South had been utilized extensively\r\njust on the eve of the Civil War, and it undoubtedly proved impossible\r\nto supply customers in that region during the ensuing conflict. However,\r\nother advertising was given a military flavor and tied in with the war,\r\nas witness the following (for 1865):\r\n\r\n     GENERAL ORDERS--No. 1\r\n\r\n     _Headquarters_\r\n\r\n     Department of this Continent and adjacent Islands\r\n\r\n     Pursuant to Division and Brigade orders issued by 8,000 Field\r\n     Officers, \"On the Spot\", where they are stationed. All Skedadlers,\r\n     Deserters, Skulkers, and all others--sick, wounded and\r\n     cripples--who have foresaken the cause of General Health, shall\r\n     immediately report to one of the aforesaid officers nearest the\r\n     point where the delinquent may be at the time this order is made\r\n     known to him, and purchase one box of\r\n\r\n     JUDSON'S\r\n     MOUNTAIN HERB PILLS\r\n\r\n     and pay the regulation price therefor. All who comply with the\r\n     terms of this order, will receive a free pardon for past offences,\r\n     and be restored to the Grand Army of General Health.\r\n                                                    A. GOOD HEALTH\r\n                                                    Lieutenant-General\r\n\r\n           By order\r\n      Dr. Judson,\r\n           Adjutant-General\r\n\r\n                                                    Sold by all dealers.\r\n\r\nTwenty years later, when the Civil War had passed out of recent memory\r\nand Confederate currency was presumably becoming a curiosity, Comstock\r\nprinted facsimiles of $20 Confederate bills,[9] with testimonials and\r\nadvertisements upon the reverse side; it can be assumed that these had\r\nenough historical interest to circulate widely and attract attention,\r\nalthough each possessor must have felt a twinge of disappointment upon\r\nrealizing that his bill was not genuine but merely an advertising\r\ngimmick.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: These facsimile bills were registered as a trademark at the\r\nUnited States Patent Office. In his registration application, Mr.\r\nComstock described himself as a citizen of the United States, residing\r\nat Morristown, N.Y.--although he had served three terms as mayor of\r\nBrockville, Ontario, prior to this time.]\r\n\r\nBack in the 1850s, the Comstock Company in lower Manhattan had an\r\nadvertising agent, one Silas B. Force, whose correspondence by some\r\nunexplained happenstance was also deposited in the loft of the Indian\r\nRoot Pill building in Morristown, even though he was not an exclusive\r\nagent and served other clients besides the Comstocks. One of these was\r\nDr. Uncas Brant, for whom Force had the following announcement printed\r\nin numerous papers:\r\n\r\n     AN OLD INDIAN DOCTOR WHO HAD made his fortune and retired from\r\n     business, will spend the remainder of his days in curing that\r\n     dreadful disease--CONSUMPTION--FREE OF CHARGE: his earnest desire\r\n     being to communicate to the world his remedies that have proved\r\n     successful in more than 3,000 cases. He requires each applicant to\r\n     send him a minute description of the symptoms, with two Stamps (6\r\n     cts) to pay the return letter, in which he will return his _advice\r\n     prescription_, with directions for preparing the medicines &c.\r\n\r\n     _The Old Doctor_ hopes that those afflicted will not, on account of\r\n     delicacy, refrain from consulting him because he makes _No Charge_.\r\n     His sole object in advertising is to do all the good he can, before\r\n     he dies. He feels that he is justly celebrated for cure of\r\n     Consumption, Asthma, Bronchitis, Nervous Affections, Coughs, Colds,\r\n     &c.\r\n          Address\r\n\r\n\r\n                                               DOCT. UNCAS BRANT\r\n                                               Box 3531, P.O., New York\r\n\r\nThis type of an apparently free diagnosis of medical ills, prompted\r\nsolely by the benevolence of some elderly or retired person, was a\r\nfamiliar petty swindle around the middle of the last century. The\r\nnewspapers carried many such announcements from retired clergymen, old\r\nnurses, or Indian doctors, frequently persons who had themselves\r\ntriumphed over dread diseases and had discovered the best remedies only\r\nafter years of search and suffering, always offering to communicate the\r\nsecret of recovery to any fellow sufferer. The victim would receive in\r\nreply a recipe for the proper medicine, always with the advice that\r\ngreat care must be taken to prepare it exactly as directed, and with the\r\nfurther advice that if the ingredients should not prove to be\r\nconveniently available the benevolent old doctor or retired clergyman\r\ncould provide them for a trifling sum. Invariably, the afflicted patient\r\nwould discover that the ingredients specified were obscure ones, not\r\nkept by one druggist in a hundred and unknown to most of them. Thus, he\r\nwould be obliged, if he persisted in the recommended cure, to send his\r\nmoney to the kindly old benefactor. Frequently, he would receive no\r\nfurther reply or, at best, would receive some concoction costing only a\r\nfew cents to compound. The scheme was all the safer as it was carried on\r\nexclusively by mail, and the swindler would usually conclude each\r\nundertaking under any given name before investigation could be\r\ninitiated.\r\n\r\nBesides participating in such schemes, Force apparently devoted a large\r\npart of his energy in collecting accounts due him or, in turn, in being\r\ndunned by and seeking to postpone payment to newspapers with whom he was\r\ndelinquent in making settlement.\r\n\r\nOther forms of advertising employed over the years included finely\r\nengraved labels, circulars and handbills, printed blotters, small\r\nbillboards, fans, premiums sent in return for labels, a concise--_very_\r\nconcise--reference dictionary, and trade cards of various sorts. One\r\ntrade card closely resembled a railroad pass; this was in the 1880s when\r\nrailroad passes were highly prized and every substantial citizen aspired\r\nto own one. Thus, almost everyone would have felt some pride in carrying\r\nwhat might pass, at a glance, as a genuine pass on the K.C.L.R.R.;\r\nalthough it was signed only by \"Good Health\" as the general agent,\r\nentitled the bearer merely to ride on foot or horseback and was actually\r\nan advertisement of Kingsland's Chlorinated Tablets. Another card played\r\nsomewhat delicately but still unmistakably on the Indian Root Pills'\r\ncapacity to restore male virility. This card pictured a fashionably\r\ndressed tomcat, complete with high collar, cane and derby, sitting\r\nsomewhat disconsolately on a fence as the crescent moon rose behind him,\r\nwith these reflections:\r\n\r\n  How terribly lonesome I feel! How queer,\r\n  To be sitting alone, with nobody near,\r\n  Oh, how I wish Maria was here,\r\n                     Mon dieu!\r\n  The thought of it fills me with horrible doubt,\r\n  I should smile, I should blush, I should wail,\r\n        I should shout,\r\n  Just suppose some fellow has cut me out!\r\n                           Me out!\r\n\r\nAnd underneath the lesson is given:\r\n\r\nDr. Morse's Indian Root Pills\r\nThe Best Family Pill in use\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 20.--A trade card advertising Kingsland's\r\nChlorinated Tablets, which closely resembled a railroad pass.]\r\n\r\nTestimonials submitted voluntarily by happy users of the pills were\r\nalways widely featured in the almanacs, newspaper advertisements, and\r\nhandbills. Although the easy concoction of the stories about Dr. Morse\r\nand Dr. Cunard might suggest that there would have been no hesitation in\r\nfabricating these testimonials, it is probable that they were genuine;\r\nat least, many have survived in the letters scattered over the floor of\r\nthe Indian Root Pill factory. In some cases one might feel that the\r\ntestimonials were lacking in entire good faith, for many of them were\r\nsubmitted by dealers desiring lenient credit or other favors. Witness,\r\nfor example, the following from B. Mollohan of Mt. Pleasant, Webster\r\nCounty, West Va., on April 16, 1879:\r\n\r\n     Pleas find here enclosed Two Dollars & 50 cts $2 _50_ cts for which\r\n     pleas place to my credit and return receipt to me for same. I cant\r\n     praise your Dr Morse pill two high never before in all my\r\n     recolection has there bin a meddison here that has given such\r\n     general satisfaction. I hope the pills will always retain their\r\n     high standing and never bee counterfeited.... I could sell any amt\r\n     Pills allmost if money was not so scarce. I have to let some out on\r\n     credit to the Sick and Poor & wait some time though I am\r\n     accountable to you for all I recd & will pay you as fast as I sell\r\n     & collect ... I have about one Doz Box on hand.\r\n\r\nMollohan's complaint about the shortage of money and the long delay in\r\ncollecting many accounts reflected a condition that prevailed throughout\r\nthe nineteenth century. Money was scarce, and the economy of many rural\r\ncommunities was still based largely on the barter system, so that it was\r\nvery difficult for farmers to generate cash for store goods.\r\nConsequently, country storekeepers had to be generous in extending\r\ncredit, and, in turn, manufacturers and jobbers had to be lenient in\r\nenforcing collection.\r\n\r\nNot all of the storekeepers could write as neatly and clearly as\r\nMollohan. The following letter, quoted in full, from Thomas Cathey of\r\nEnfield, Illinois, on January 23, 1880, not merely presented a problem\r\nrelating to the company's policy of awarding exclusive territories but\r\noffered considerable difficulty in deciphering:\r\n\r\n    mr CumStock der ser i thaut i Wod rite yo\r\n    u a few lineS to inform you that i was the fir\r\n    St agent for you pills in thiS Setlement but th\r\n    as iS Several agent round her and tha ar interfer\r\n    With mee eSpeSly William a StavSon he liveS her\r\n    at enfield he Wanted mee to giv him one of you Sur\r\n    klerS So he Wod be agent but i Wodent let hi\r\n    m hav hit an he rote to you i SupoSe an haS got a\r\n    Suplye of pillS an ar aruning a gant mee he iS Sell\r\n    ing them at 20 centS a box i Want you to St\r\n    op him if you pleeS\r\n\r\n    mr CumStock i Sent you too dollars the 21 p\r\n    leeS Credet my a Count With hit mr.

An invitation to agents (about 1885)\r\ndeclared that\r\n\r\n     For some years past they have not been advertised in newspapers,\r\n     they being filled with sensational advertisements of quack nostrums\r\n     got up for no other purpose than catch-penny articles ...\r\n\r\nThe Indian Root Pills obviously claimed a more lofty stature than other,\r\ncommon proprietary remedies. The exclusive representation scheme was\r\nalso a partial substitution for newspaper advertising; the company was\r\naggressive in soliciting additional agents--aiming at one in every town\r\nand village--and then in encouraging them to push the pills by offering\r\nprizes such as watches, jewelry, and table utensils.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: In connection with this offer the pills were priced to\r\nagents at $2 per dozen boxes--$24 per gross--and were to be retailed at\r\n$3 per dozen--25¢ per box. Other agreements, however, probably intended\r\nfor more substantial dealers, specified a price of $16 per gross for the\r\nIndian Root Pills.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 21.--Cover for booklet used as a circular\r\ndescribing the Indian Root Pills.]\r\n\r\nWhat were the ingredients of the Indian Root Pills and the other\r\nComstock preparations? Originally, the formulas for the various remedies\r\nwere regarded as closely held secrets, divulged only to proprietors and\r\npartners--and not even to all of them--and certainly never revealed to\r\nthe purchasers. But despite this secrecy, charges of counterfeiting and\r\nimitating popular preparations were widespread. In many cases, the\r\nalleged counterfeits were probably genuine--to the extent that either of\r\nthese terms has meaning--for it was a recurrent practice for junior\r\npartners and clerks at one drug house to branch off on their own, taking\r\nsome of the secrets with them--just as Andrew B. White left Moore and\r\njoined the Comstocks, bringing the Indian Root Pills with him.\r\n\r\nIn the latter years, under the rules of the Federal Food and Drug Act,\r\nthe ingredients were required to be listed on the package; thus we know\r\nthat the Indian Root Pills, in the 1930s and 1940s, contained aloes,\r\nmandrake, gamboge, jalap, and cayenne pepper.\r\n\r\n_Aloe_ is a tropical plant of which the best known medicinal varieties\r\ncome from Socotra and Zanzibar; those received by the Comstock factory\r\nwere generally described as Cape (of Good Hope) _Aloe_. The juice\r\n_Aloes_ is extracted from the leaves of this plant and since antiquity\r\nhas been regarded as a valuable drug, particularly for its laxative and\r\nvermifuge properties. _Mandrake_ has always been reputed to have\r\naphrodisiac qualities. _Gamboge_ is a large tree native to Ceylon and\r\nSoutheast Asia, which produces a resinous gum, more commonly used by\r\npainters as a coloring material, but also sometimes employed in medicine\r\nas a cathartic. _Jalap_ is a flowering plant which grows only at high\r\naltitudes in Mexico, and its root produces an extract with a powerful\r\npurgative effect. All of these ingredients possessed one especial\r\nfeature highly prized by the patent-medicine manufacturers of the\r\nnineteenth century, i.e., they were derived from esoteric plants found\r\nonly in geographically remote locations. One does find it rather\r\nremarkable, however, that the native Indian chiefs who confided the\r\nsecrets of these remedies to Dr. Morse and Dr. Cunard were so familiar\r\nwith drugs originating in Asia and Africa.[11] The Indians may very well\r\nhave been acquainted with the properties of jalap, native to this\r\ncontinent, but the romantic circumstances of its discovery, early in the\r\nlast century seem considerably overdrawn, as the medicinal properties of\r\njalap were generally recognized in England as early as 1600.\r\n\r\nWhether the formula for the Indian Root Pills had been constant since\r\ntheir \"discovery\"--as all advertising of the company implied--we have no\r\nway of knowing for sure. However, the company's book of trade receipts\r\nfor the 1860s shows the recurring purchase of large quantities of these\r\nfive drugs, which suggests that the ingredients did remain substantially\r\nunchanged for over a century. For other remedies manufactured by the\r\ncompany, the ingredients purchased included:\r\n\r\nAnise Seed\r\nBlack Antimony\r\nCalomel\r\nCamphor\r\nGum Arabic\r\nGum Asphaltum\r\nGum Tragacanth\r\nHemlock Oil\r\nHorehound\r\nLaudanum\r\nLicorice Root\r\nMagnolia Water\r\nMuriatic Acid\r\nSaltpetre\r\nSienna Oil\r\nSulphur\r\nWormseed\r\n\r\nIt is not known where the calomel (mercurous chloride) and some of the\r\nother harsher ingredients were used--certainly not in the Indian Root\r\nPills or the Mountain Herb Worm Tea--for the company frequently\r\nincorporated warnings against the use of calomel in its advertising and\r\neven promised rewards to persons proving that any of its preparations\r\ncontained calomel.\r\n\r\nLess active ingredients used to supply bulk and flavor included alcohol,\r\nturpentine, sugar, corn starch, linseed meal, rosin, tallow, and white\r\nglue. Very large quantities of sugar were used, for we find that\r\nComstock was buying one 250-pound barrel of sugar from C.B. Herriman in\r\nOgdensburg approximately once a month. In the patent-medicine business\r\nit was necessary, of course, that the pills and tonics must be\r\npalatable, neutralizing the unpleasant flavor of some of the active\r\ningredients; therefore large quantities of sugar and of pleasant-tasting\r\nherbs were required. It was also desirable, for obvious reasons, to\r\nincorporate some stimulant or habit-forming element into the various\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Actually, the formula for the Indian Root Pills would seem\r\nto have corresponded closely with that for \"Indian Cathartic Pills\"\r\ngiven in _Dr. Chase's Recipes_, published in 1866. These were described\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     Aloes and gamboge, of each 1 oz.; mandrake and blood-root, with gum\r\n     myrrh, of each 1/4 oz.; gum camphor and cayenne, of each 1-1/2\r\n     drs.; ginger, 4 oz.; all finely pulverized and thoroughly mixed,\r\n     with thick mucilage (made by putting a little water upon equal\r\n     quantities of gum arabic and gum tragacanth) into pill mass; then\r\n     formed into common sized pills. Dose: Two to four pills, according\r\n     to the robustness of the patient.]\r\n\r\nA register of incoming shipments for the year 1905 shows that the\r\nfactory was still receiving large quantities of aloes, gamboge,\r\nmandrake, jalap, and pepper. One new ingredient being used at this time\r\nwas talc, some of which originated at Gouverneur, within a few miles of\r\nthe pill manufactory, but more of it was described as \"German talc.\" The\r\nsame register gives the formulas for three of the company's other\r\npreparations. One of these, the _Nerve & Bone Liniment_, was simply\r\ncompounded of four elements:\r\n\r\n    3 gal. Turpentine\r\n    2 qts. Linseed Oil\r\n    2 lbs. Hemlock\r\n    2 lbs. Concentrated Amonia.\r\n\r\nThe formula for the _Condition Powders_ (for horses and livestock) was\r\nfar more complex, consisting of:\r\n\r\n    4 lbs. Sulphur\r\n    4 lbs. Saltpetre\r\n    4 lbs. Black Antimony\r\n    4 lbs. Feongreek Seed\r\n    8 lbs. Oil Meal\r\n    1-1/2 oz. Arsenic\r\n    2 oz. Tart Antimony\r\n    6 lbs. Powdered Rosin\r\n    2 lbs. Salt\r\n    2 lbs. Ashes\r\n    4 lbs. Brand (Bran-?).\r\n\r\nThe name of the third preparation was not given, but the ingredients\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n    1 oz. Dry White Lead\r\n    1 oz. Oxide of Zinc\r\n    1/2 oz. Precipitated Chalk\r\n    3 oz. Glycerine\r\n    Add 1 lb. Glue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 22.--A partial list of remedies offered for sale\r\nby Lucius Comstock in 1854, shortly after the separation of the old\r\ncompany into the rival firms of Comstock & Co. and Comstock & Brother.]\r\n\r\nOriginally, Comstock and its predecessor firms marketed a large number\r\nof remedies. In 1854, Comstock & Company--then controlled by Lucius\r\nComstock--listed nearly forty of its own preparations for sale, namely:\r\n\r\nOldridge's Balm of Columbia\r\nGeorge's Honduras Sarsaparilla\r\nEast India Hair Dye, colors the hair and not the skin\r\nAcoustic Oil, for deafness\r\nVermifuge\r\nBartholomew's Expectorant Syrup\r\nCarlton's Specific Cure for Ringbone, Spavin and Wind-galls\r\nDr. Sphon's Head Ache Remedy\r\nDr. Connol's Gonorrhea Mixture\r\nMother's Relief\r\nNipple Salve\r\nRoach and Bed Bug Bane\r\nSpread Plasters\r\nJudson's Cherry and Lungwort\r\nAzor's Turkish Balm, for the Toilet and Hair\r\nCarlton's Condition Powder, for Horses and Cattle\r\nConnel's Pain Extractor\r\nWestern Indian Panaceas\r\nHunter's Pulmonary Balsam\r\nLinn's Pills and Bitters\r\nOil of Tannin, for Leather\r\nNerve & Bone Liniment (Hewe's)\r\nNerve & Bone Liniment (Comstock's)\r\nIndian Vegetable Elixir\r\nHay's Liniment for Piles\r\nTooth Ache Drops\r\nKline Tooth Drops\r\nCarlton's Nerve and Bone Liniment, for Horses\r\nCondition Powders, for Horses\r\nPain Killer\r\nLin's Spread Plasters\r\nCarlton's Liniment for the Piles, warranted to cure\r\nDr. Mc Nair's Acoustic Oil, for Deafness\r\nDr. Larzetti's Acoustic Oil, for Deafness\r\nSalt Rheum Cure\r\nAzor's Turkish Wine\r\nDr. Larzetti's Juno Cordial, or Procreative Elixir\r\nBritish Heave Powders\r\n\r\nAll of the foregoing were medicines for which Lucius claimed to be the\r\nsole proprietor--although it is improbable that he manufactured all of\r\nthem: several of them were probably identical preparations under\r\ndifferent labels. In addition to these, he offered a larger list of\r\nmedicines as a dealer. Brother J. Carlton Comstock must have been the\r\nmain originator of medicines within the firm; he seems to have\r\nspecialized largely in veterinary remedies, although the liniment for\r\nthe piles also stood to his credit. Despite Lucius' claim to sole\r\nproprietorship of these remedies, the departing brothers also\r\nmanufactured and sold most of the identical items, adding two or three\r\nadditional preparations, such as Dr. Chilton's Fever and Ague Pills and\r\nYouatt's Gargling Oil (for animals). Aside from J. Carlton Comstock and\r\nJudson, the originators of most of the other preparations are cloaked in\r\nmystery; most of them were probably entirely fictitious. Admittedly,\r\nWilliam Youatt (1776-1847), for whom several of the animal remedies were\r\nnamed, was an actual British veterinarian and his prescriptions were\r\nprobably genuine, but whether he authorized their sale by proprietary\r\nmanufacturers or was himself rewarded in any way are questions for\r\nspeculation. The versatile Dr. Larzetti seems to have experimented both\r\nwith impotency and deafness, but his ear oil--a number of specimens of\r\nwhich were still on hand in the abandoned factory--was identical in\r\nevery respect with Dr. McNair's oil, as the labels and directions, aside\r\nonly from the names of the doctors, were exactly the same for both\r\npreparations. In fact, some careless printer had even made up a batch of\r\ncirculars headed \"Dr. Mc Nair's Acoustic Oil\" but concluding with the\r\nadmonition, \"Ask for Larzetti's Acoustic Oil and take no other.\"\r\nPresumably simple Americans who were distrustful of foreigners would\r\ntake Mc Nair's oil, but more sophisticated persons, aware of the\r\naccomplishments of doctors in Rome and Vienna, might prefer Larzetti's\r\npreparation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 23.--Dr. McNair's and Dr. Larzetti's acoustic oil\r\napparently were identical in every respect. Labels and directions, with\r\nthe difference only of the doctors' names, were quite obviously printed\r\nfrom the same type.]\r\n\r\nAs the century moved along, the Comstock factory at Morristown reduced\r\nthe number of remedies it manufactured, and concentrated on the ones\r\nthat were most successful, which included, besides the Indian Root\r\nPills, Judson's Mountain Herb Pills, Judson's Worm Tea, Carlton's\r\nCondition Powders, Carlton's Nerve & Bone Liniment, and Kingsland's\r\nChlorinated Tablets. At some undisclosed point, Carlton's Nerve & Bone\r\nLiniment for Horses, originally registered with the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution on June 30, 1851, ceased to be a medicine for animals and\r\nbecame one for humans. And sometime around 1920 the Judson name\r\ndisappeared, the worm medicine thereafter was superseded by Comstock's\r\nWorm Pellets. Long before this, Judson had been transposed into somewhat\r\nof a mythical character--\"old Dr. Judson\"--who had devised the Dead Shot\r\nWorm Candy on the basis of seventy years' medical experience.\r\n\r\nDuring the final years of the Comstock business in Morristown, in the\r\n1930s, 1940s, and 1950s, only three items were manufactured and sold:\r\nthe Indian Root Pills, the Dead Shot Worm Pellets and Comstock's N & B\r\nLiniment.[12] The worm pellets had been devised by Mrs. Hill, \"an old\r\nEnglish nurse of various and extended experience in the foundling\r\nhospitals of Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nBesides its chemicals and herbs, the Comstock factory was a heavy\r\nconsumer of pillboxes and bottles. While the company advertised, in its\r\nlatter years, that \"our pills are packaged in metal containers--not in\r\ncheap wooden boxes,\" they were, in fact, packaged for many decades in\r\nsmall oval boxes made of a thin wooden veneer. These were manufactured\r\nby Ira L. Quay of East Berne, New York, at a price of 12¢ per gross. The\r\npill factory often must have been a little slow in paying, for Quay was\r\ninvariably prodding for prompt remittance, as in this letter of December\r\n25, 1868:\r\n\r\n     Mr Wm h comstock\r\n\r\n     Dear sir we have sent you one tierce & 3 cases of pill boxes wich\r\n     we want you to send us a check for as soon as you git this for we\r\n     have to pay it the first of next month & must have the money if you\r\n     want eney moure boxes we will send them & wait for the money till\r\n     the first of april youres truly\r\n\r\n                                                 Quay & Champion\r\n\r\nQuay continued to supply the boxes for at least fifteen years, during\r\nwhich his need for prompt payment never diminished. Comstock also bought\r\nlarge quantities of bottles, corks, packing boxes, and wrappers.\r\nThroughout the company's long existence, however, more frequent payments\r\nwere made to printers and stationers--for the heavy flow of almanacs,\r\nhandbills, labels, trade cards, direction sheets, and billheads--than\r\nfor all the drugs and packaging materials. In the success achieved by\r\nthe Indian Root Pills, the printing press was just as important a\r\ncontributor as the pill-mixing machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n*The Final Years*\r\n\r\nWhen William Henry Comstock, Sr., moved the Indian Root Pill business to\r\nMorristown, in 1867, he was--at age 37--at least approaching middle\r\nlife. Yet he was still to remain alive, healthy, and in direct charge of\r\nthe medicine business for more than half a century longer. And the\r\ngolden era of the patent-medicine business may be said to have coincided\r\nvery closely with Mr. Comstock's active career--from about 1848 to 1919.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: However, additional items were manufactured by the Dr.\r\nHoward Medicine Co., affiliated with the Comstock factory in Brockville.\r\nAlso, during World War II the company accepted an Army contract for the\r\nmanufacture and packaging of foot powder.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 24.--In its final years the Comstock factory\r\ndiscontinued most of its old remedies and concentrated upon the three\r\nmost successful: Comstock's Dead Shot Worm Pellets, Comstock's N. & B.\r\nLiniment, and Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.]\r\n\r\nWhile no schedule of sales, net income, or financial results are\r\navailable, the fragmentary records make it obvious that the business\r\ncontinued to flourish beyond World War I, and long after the passage of\r\nthe first Food and Drug Act--in 1906. The almanacs were still printed as\r\nrecently as 1938; while the labels and other advertising matter\r\nabandoned their ornate nineteenth-century style and assumed a distinctly\r\nmodern aspect--to the extent of introducing comic-style picture stories,\r\nfeaturing the small boy who lacked energy to make the little league\r\nbaseball team (he had worms), and the girl who lacked male admirers\r\nbecause of pimples on her face (she suffered from irregular\r\nelimination). Sales volume of the Morristown factory, however,\r\napparently did reach a peak early in the present century--perhaps around\r\n1910--and began a more rapid decline during the 1920s. During this same\r\nperiod the geographical character of the market shifted significantly;\r\nas domestic orders dropped off, a very substantial foreign business,\r\nparticularly in Latin America, sprang up. While this did not compensate\r\nfully for the loss of domestic sales, it did provide a heavy volume that\r\nundoubtedly prolonged the life of the Indian Root Pill factory by\r\nseveral decades.\r\n\r\nWilliam Henry Comstock, Sr., who first came to Brockville in 1860, at a\r\ntime when the struggle with White for the control of the pills was still\r\nin progress, married a Canadian girl, Josephine Elliot, in 1864; by this\r\nmarriage he had one son, Edwin, who lived only to the age of 28. In 1893\r\nComstock married, for a second time, Miss Alice J. Gates, and it is a\r\nfavorable testimony to the efficacy of some of his own virility\r\nmedicines that at age 67 he sired another son, William Henry Comstock II\r\n(or \"Young Bill\") on July 4, 1897. In the meanwhile, the elder Comstock\r\nhad become one of the most prominent citizens of Brockville, which he\r\nserved three terms as mayor and once represented in the Canadian\r\nparliament. Besides his medicine factories on both sides of the river,\r\nhe was active in other business and civic organizations, helped to\r\npromote the Brockville, Westport & Northwestern Railway, and was highly\r\nregarded as a philanthropist. Although he lived well into the automobile\r\nage, he always preferred his carriage, and acquired a reputation as a\r\nconnoisseur and breeder of horses. As remarked earlier, his steam yacht\r\nwas also a familiar sight in the upper reaches of the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nThe medicine business in Morristown was operated as a sole\r\nproprietorship by Comstock from the establishment here in 1867 up until\r\n1902, when it was succeeded by W.H. Comstock Co., Ltd., a Canadian\r\ncorporation. St. Lawrence County deeds record the transfer of the\r\nproperty--still preserving the 36-foot strip for the railroad--from\r\npersonal to corporate ownership at that time.\r\n\r\nComstock--the same callow youth who had been charged with rifling\r\nLucius' mail in the primitive New York City of 1851--came to the end of\r\nhis long life in 1919. He was succeeded immediately by his son, William\r\nHenry II, who had only recently returned from military service during\r\nWorld War I. According to Mrs. Planty, former Morristown historian,\r\n\"Young Bill\" had been active in the business before the war and was\r\nmaking an inspection of the company's depots in the Orient, in the\r\nsummer of 1914, when he was stranded in China by the cancellation of\r\ntranspacific shipping services and was therefore obliged to cross China\r\nand Russia by the Transiberian Railway. This story, however, strains\r\ncredulity a trifle, as the journey would have brought him closer to the\r\nscene of conflict at that time, and he was, in any event, only 17 years\r\nold when these events are supposed to have occurred.\r\n\r\nThe decline of the patent-medicine business was ascribed by Stewart\r\nHolbrook in his _Golden Age of Quackery_ to three main factors: the Pure\r\nFood and Drug Acts; the automobile; and higher standards of public\r\neducation. All of these were, of course, strongly in evidence by the\r\n1920s, when William Henry Comstock II was beginning his career as the\r\nhead of the Indian Root Pill enterprise. Nevertheless, the Morristown\r\nplant was still conducting a very respectable business at this time and\r\nwas to continue for some four decades longer. The Comstock enterprise\r\nnever seemed to have been much embarrassed by the muckraking attacks\r\nthat surrounded the passage of the Federal Food and Drug Act of 1906.\r\nAside from the enforcement of these measures by the energetic Harvey\r\nWiley, the two most effective private assaults upon the patent-medicine\r\ntrade probably were the exposures by Samuel Hopkins Adams in a series of\r\narticles in _Collier's_ magazine in 1905-1906, under the title, \"The\r\nGreat American Fraud,\" and the two volumes entitled, _Nostrums and\r\nQuackery_, embodying reprints of numerous articles in the _Journal of\r\nthe American Medical Association_ over a period of years. Both sources\r\nnamed names fearlessly and described consequences bluntly. But the\r\nComstock remedies, either because they may have been deemed harmless, or\r\nbecause the company's location in a small village in a remote corner of\r\nthe country enabled it to escape unfriendly attention, seemed to have\r\nenjoyed relative immunity from these attacks. At least, none of the\r\nComstock remedies was mentioned by name.[13] To be sure, these\r\npreparations--or at least those destined for consumption within the\r\nUnited States--had to comply with the new drug laws, to publish their\r\ningredients, and over a period of time to reduce sharply the extensive\r\nlist of conditions which they were supposed to cure. Nevertheless, it\r\nseems probable that the general change in public attitudes rather than\r\nany direct consequences of legislative enforcement caused the eventual\r\ndemise of the Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 25.--Comstock packaging building (upper floor used\r\nas residence for manager--note laundry) at left, hotel at right. Ferry\r\nslip directly ahead. About 1915.]\r\n\r\nForeign business began to assume considerable importance after 1900;\r\nshipments from Morristown to the West Indies and Latin America were\r\nheavy, and the company also listed branches (perhaps no more than\r\nwarehouses or agencies) in London, Hongkong, and Sydney, Australia.\r\nCertain of the order books picked up out of the litter on the floor of\r\nthe abandoned factory give a suggestion of sales volume since 1900:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Dr. William's Pink Pills, also headquartered in\r\nBrockville, were not so fortunate, as they were mentioned disparagingly\r\nin both the _Collier's_ and American Medical Association articles. Among\r\nnumerous proprietary manufacturers who protested, blustered, or\r\nthreatened legal action against _Collier's_, the Dr. Williams Co. was\r\none of only two who actually instituted a libel suit.]\r\n\r\n   SALES OF DR.

Also, this\r\ntabulation excludes sales in quantities less than one gross, and there\r\nwere actually many such smaller orders. Only physical shipments were\r\nshown in the records recovered, and the dollar volume is the author's\r\ncomputation at $16 per gross, the price which prevailed for many years.\r\nThrough 1900 there was only a single order book; beginning prior to\r\n1910, separate domestic and foreign order books were introduced, but\r\nmost of them have been lost. On the assumption that there was a fair\r\nvolume of foreign sales in 1910, total sales must have continued to\r\nclimb through the decade then ending, but by 1920 domestic sales--and\r\nprobably total sales--had dropped materially. The number of employees,\r\napparently about forty at the peak of the business, had dropped to\r\nthirteen according to the 1915 paybook but recovered slightly to sixteen\r\nin 1922. These fragmentary data suggest that the Morristown branch of\r\nthe Comstock enterprise probably never grossed much over $100,000, but\r\nin an era when $12 or $15 represented a good weekly wage and the\r\nclutching grasp of the income-tax collector was still unknown, this was\r\nmore than adequate to support the proprietor in comfort and to number\r\nhim among the more influential citizens of the district. It is not known\r\nhow Morristown sales compared with those of the Brockville factory, but\r\nit may be assumed that the company utilized its \"dual nationality\" to\r\nthe utmost advantage, to benefit from favorable tariff laws and minimize\r\nthe restrictions of both countries. The Morristown plant supplied the\r\nlucrative Latin American trade, while during the era of Imperial\r\npreference, Brockville must have handled the English, Oriental, and\r\nAustralian business.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 26.--In its final years the Comstock advertising\r\nassumed a modern guise. Depicted here is the N. & B. Liniment\r\n(originally registered with the Smithsonian as Carlton's Celebrated\r\nNerve and Bone Liniment for horses, in 1851).]\r\n\r\nFor many decades--from 1900 at least up into the 1930s--a number of very\r\nlarge shipments, normally 100 gross or more in single orders, were made\r\nto Gilpin, Langdon & Co., Baltimore, and to Columbia Warehouse Co. in\r\nSt. Louis, important regional distributors.\r\n\r\nMany substantial orders were also received from legitimate drug houses,\r\nsuch as Lehn & Fink; Schieffelin & Co.; Smith, Kline & French; and\r\nMcKesson & Robbins. Curiously, A.J. White & Co. of New York City also\r\nappears in the order book, around 1900, as an occasional purchaser.\r\nAmong the foreign orders received in 1930 the United Fruit Company was,\r\nby a wide margin, the largest single customer.\r\n\r\nPills destined for the Latin American market were packaged alternatively\r\nin \"glass\" or \"tin,\" and were also labeled \"Spanish\" or \"English,\" as\r\nthe purchasers might direct. Spanish language almanacs and other\r\nadvertising matter were generally inserted in the foreign parcels, along\r\nwith many copies of \"tapes\"--the advertisements of the worm pills\r\nconspicuously illustrated with a horrifying picture of an enormous\r\ntapeworm.\r\n\r\nSales volume began to decline more precipitously in the 1930s, and the\r\nMorristown factory was no longer working even close to capacity. The\r\ndomestic order book for 1941 shows sales of the Indian Root Pills, in\r\nquantities of one gross or more, of only 316 gross. The Royal Drug Co.\r\nof Chicago gave one single order for 44 gross, and Myers Bros. Drug Co.\r\nof St. Louis bought 25 gross in one shot, but otherwise orders in excess\r\nof five gross were rare, and those for one gross alone--or for one half\r\ngross, one fourth gross, or one sixth gross--were far more common. The\r\nnumber of orders was still substantial, and the packing and mailing\r\nclerks must have been kept fairly busy, but they were working hard for a\r\nsharply reduced total volume. Some stimulus was provided for the factory\r\nduring the war years by a military contract for foot powder, but the\r\ndecline became even more precipitous after the conflict. The Comstock\r\nHotel was destroyed by fire in 1925, never to be rebuilt. And by the\r\nlate 1940s the once-busy railroad bisecting the factory property--the\r\nold Utica & Black River--had deteriorated to one lonely train crawling\r\nover its track in each direction, on weekdays only, but still carrying a\r\nNew York City sleeping car. The 1950 order book reveals a business that\r\nhad withered away to almost nothing. Once again, as in 1900, both\r\nforeign and domestic sales were recorded in a single book, but now\r\nforeign sales greatly outstripped the domestic. In fact, a mere 18 gross\r\nof the pills were sold--in quantities of one gross or more--in the\r\ndomestic market in that year, contrasting sadly with nearly 6,000 gross\r\nin 1910. Even the Henry P. Gilpin Co. of Baltimore, which at one time\r\nhad been ordering 100 gross or more every month or six weeks, took only\r\na meager four gross during the entire year. There were a large number of\r\nvery small shipments--such as four boxes of pills here, or a bottle of\r\nliniment there--but these did not aggregate very much and gave the\r\nappearance of merely accommodating individual customers who could no\r\nlonger find their favorite remedies in their own local drug stores.\r\n\r\nThe foreign business--chiefly in the West Indies, Puerto Rico, and South\r\nAmerica--was still fairly substantial in 1950, amounting to 579 gross of\r\nthe Indian Root Pills, but this was far from compensating for the\r\nvirtual disappearance of the domestic market. At the old price of $16\r\nper gross--which may no longer have been correct in 1950--the Morristown\r\nfactory could not have taken in a great deal more than $10,000--hardly\r\nenough to justify its continued operation. In any case, it was obviously\r\nonly the foreign business that kept the plant operating as long as it\r\ndid; without that it would probably have closed its doors 20 years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\nA number of customers were, however, faithful to the Comstock Company\r\nfor very many years. Schieffelin & Co. and McKesson & Robbins were both\r\nimportant customers way back in the 1840s, and their favor had been an\r\nobject of dispute in the split between Lucius and the other brothers in\r\n1851. Schieffelin still appeared frequently in the order books up to the\r\n1920s; during the final years McKesson & Robbins was by far the largest\r\nsingle domestic customer. A number of other firms--John L. Thompson Sons\r\n& Co. of Troy, N.Y.; T. Sisson & Co. of Hartford, Conn.; and Gilman\r\nBrothers of Boston, Mass.--appear both in the 1896 and the 1950 order\r\nbooks, although unfortunately the quantities taken had fallen from one\r\nor two gross at a shot in the earlier year to a mere quarter gross or a\r\nfew dozen boxes by 1950.\r\n\r\nToward the end, in the late 1950s, employment in the factory dropped to\r\nonly three persons--J.M. Barney (foreman), Charles Pitcher, and\r\nFlorence Cree--and they were only doing maintenance work and filling\r\nsuch few orders, mostly in quantities of a few dozen boxes only, that\r\ncame to the factory unsolicited. Gone were the days of travelers\r\nscouring the back country, visiting country druggists, and pushing the\r\npills, while simultaneously disparaging rival or \"counterfeit\"\r\nconcoctions; gone were the days when the almanacs and other advertising\r\ncirculars poured out of Morristown in the millions of copies; long since\r\nvanished were the sweeping claims of marvelous cures for every\r\nconceivable ailment. In these final days the Indian Root Pills, now\r\npackaged in a flat metal box with a sliding lid, were described modestly\r\nas the Handy Vegetable Laxative. And the ingredients were now printed on\r\nthe box; nothing more was heard of Dr. Morse's remarkable discovery\r\ngleaned during his long sojourn with the Indians of the western plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27.--The pill-mixing building, about 1928\r\n(building torn down in 1971).]\r\n\r\nAlthough the records disclose nothing to this effect, it is a fair\r\npremise that the Comstock family often must have considered closing the\r\nMorristown plant after World War II and, more particularly, in the\r\ndecade of the 1950s. Such inclinations may, however, have been countered\r\nby a willingness to let the plant run as long as a trickle of business\r\ncontinued and it did not fall too far short of covering expenses. The\r\nlast few surviving employees were very elderly, and their jobs may have\r\nbeen regarded as a partial substitute for pensions. This view is\r\nevidenced by an injury report for George Clute, who suffered a fit of\r\ncoughing while mixing pills in January 1941; he was then 77 years old\r\nand had been working in the factory for 34 years. The final paybooks\r\nshow deductions for Social Security and unemployment\r\ninsurance--specimens of vexatious red tape that the factory had avoided\r\nfor most of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe decision to close the Morristown factory was finally forced upon the\r\nfamily, on May 15, 1959, by the death of William Henry Comstock\r\nII--\"Young Bill\"--who had been president of the company since 1921.\r\nLike his father, \"Young Bill\" Comstock had been a prominent citizen of\r\nBrockville for many years, served a term as mayor--although he was\r\ndefeated in a contest for a parliamentary seat--was also active in civic\r\nand social organizations, and achieved recognition as a sportsman and\r\nspeedboat operator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 28.--The packaging and office building at left,\r\ndepot in center, and Comstock Hotel at right. Canadian shore and city of\r\nBrockville (location of another Comstock factory) in background.]\r\n\r\nThe actual end of the business came in the spring of 1960. The frequency\r\nand size of orders had dropped sharply, although the names of many of\r\nthe old customers still appeared, as well as individuals who would send\r\none dollar for three boxes of the pills. These small shipments were\r\nusually mailed, rather than going by express or freight, as formerly.\r\nThe very last two shipments, appropriately, were to old customers: One\r\npackage of one-dozen boxes of pills on March 31, 1960, to Gilman\r\nBrothers of Boston, and two-dozen boxes to McKesson & Robbins at Mobile,\r\nAlabama, on April 11. And with this final consignment the factory closed\r\nits doors, concluding ninety-three years of continuous operation in the\r\nriverside village of Morristown.\r\n\r\nVery little of this story remains to be told. Mrs. Comstock became\r\npresident of the company during its liquidation--and thus was a\r\nsuccessor to her _father-in-law_, who had first entered the business as\r\na clerk, _119 years earlier_, in 1841. The good will of the company and\r\na few assets were sold to the Milburn Company of Scarborough, Ontario,\r\nbut the Comstock business was terminated, and the long career of Dr.\r\nMorse's Indian Root Pills brought to a close. The few superannuated\r\nemployees were assured of protection against all medical expenses, by\r\nthe company or by the Comstock family, for the rest of their lives. A\r\nfew years later the associated Canadian factory standing in the heart of\r\nBrockville was torn down; during its lifetime that community had grown\r\nup around it, from a village to a flourishing small city. The buildings\r\nin Morristown were sold to other parties and left to stand untenanted\r\nand forlorn for years. The upper (packaging) building, from which the\r\nrecords were recovered, remains in fair condition and may yet be\r\nrenovated for some further use. The lower (pill-mixing) building, after\r\nstanding derelict and at the point of collapse for many years, was\r\nfinally torn down in 1971. The hotel, a large water tank behind the\r\nfactory, and the combination depot and customs house have all vanished\r\nfrom the scene. The shed where the Comstocks kept their yacht has been\r\nmaintained and still shelters several boats, but the ferry slip just\r\nbelow the factory steps is now abandoned, and no longer do vessels ply\r\nback and forth across the river to connect Morristown and Brockville.\r\nThe railroad only survived the passing of the factory by a year or two\r\nand is now memorialized by no more than a line of decaying ties. The\r\nmain highway leading westward from Ogdensburg toward the Thousand\r\nIslands area has been straightened and rerouted to avoid Morristown, so\r\nthat now only the straying or misguided traveler will enter the village.\r\nIf he does enter he will find a pleasant community, scenically located\r\non a small bay of the St. Lawrence River, commanding an enticing view of\r\nthe Canadian shore, and rising in several stages above the lower level,\r\nwhere the factory once stood; but it is a somnolent village. No longer\r\ndo river packet steamers call at the sagging pier, no longer do trains\r\nthread their way between the factory buildings and chug to a halt at the\r\nadjacent station. No longer do hope-giving pills and elixirs, or\r\nalmanacs and circulars in the millions, pour out of Morristown destined\r\nfor country drugstores and lonely farmhouses over half a continent. Only\r\nmemories persist around the empty ferry slip, the vanished railroad\r\nstation, and the abandoned factory buildings--for so many years the home\r\nof the distinguished Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*Bibliography*\r\n\r\nThe principal source of information for this history of the Comstock\r\nmedicine business comprises the records, letters, documents, and\r\nadvertising matter found in the abandoned pill-factory building at\r\nMorristown, New York. Supplemental information was obtained from\r\nbiographies, local and county histories, old city directories,\r\ngenealogies, back files of newspapers, and materials from the office of\r\nthe St. Lawrence County Historian, at the courthouse, Canton, New York.\r\n\r\nTwo standard histories of the patent-medicine era in America are:\r\n\r\nHolbrook, Stewart H. _Golden Age of Quackery._ New York City: Macmillan\r\nCo. 1959.\r\n\r\nYoung, J.H. _The Toadstool Millionaires, A Social History of Patent\r\nMedicines in America Before Federal Regulation._ Princeton University\r\nPress. 1961.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present century, during the \"exposure\" of the\r\npatent-medicine industry, two principal critical works also were\r\npublished, each highly specific and naming names fearlessly:\r\n\r\nAdams, Samuel Hopkins. _The Great American Fraud._ Serially in\r\n_Collier's_ Magazine in 1905-1906. (Reprinted in book form, 1906.)\r\n\r\nAmerican Medical Association. _Nostrums and Quackery._ Chicago: American\r\nMedical Association Press. (Reprints from the _Journal of the American\r\nMedical Association_: volume I, 1911; volume II, 1921; volume III,\r\n1936.)\r\n\r\nRecently two books have appeared, which are largely pictorial,\r\nessentially uncritical, and strive mainly to recapture the colorfulness\r\nand ingenuity of patent-medicine advertising.\r\n\r\nCarson, Gerald. _One for a Man, Two for a Horse._ 128 pages. New York\r\nCity: Doubleday and Co. 1961.\r\n\r\nHechtlinger, Adelaide. _The Great Patent Medicine Era._ New York City:\r\nGrosset and Dunlap. 1970.\r\n\r\nA highly recommended source of information on the very early history of\r\npatent medicines in America is:\r\n\r\nGriffenhagen, George B., and James Harvey Young. Old English Patent\r\nMedicines in America. _United States National Museum Bulletin 218,\r\nContributions from the Museum of History and Technology_, paper 10:\r\n155-183 1959.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     DR. MORSE'S PILLS LIVE ON\r\n\r\n     Although the original Comstock enterprise has been dissolved and\r\n     all of its undertakings in North America terminated, as has been\r\n     related herein, Dr. Morse's Indian Root Pills and Comstock's Worm\r\n     Tablets are still being manufactured and sold--by the W.H. Comstock\r\n     Company Pty. Ltd., in Australia. This concern, originally a\r\n     subsidiary of the Canadian company, is headed by the former branch\r\n     manager for the Comstocks, who acquired the rights for Australia\r\n     and the Orient following the dissolution of the Brockville company.\r\n     Distribution is also carried out from this source into New Zealand,\r\n     Singapore, and Hong Kong. Packaging and directions are now modern,\r\n     the pills being described as \"The Overnight Laxative with the Tonic\r\n     Action,\" but a reproduction of the old label and the facsimile\r\n     signature of William Henry Comstock, Sr., are still being\r\n     portrayed. Thus, the Indian Root Pills have been manufactured\r\n     continuously for at least 115 years and the Comstock business,\r\n     through the original and successor firms, has survived for nearly\r\n     140 years.",
