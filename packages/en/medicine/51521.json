Some years ago, in a series of Essays which were intended to\r\nbe provocative and educational, rather than expository, he described\r\nthe direction towards which he was pressing. I had the privilege of\r\nintroducing these Essays to English readers under the title _The Nature\r\nof Man_, a Study in Optimistic Philosophy. In that volume, Professor\r\nMetchnikoff recounted how sentient man, regarding his lot in the world,\r\nhad found it evil. Philosophy and literature, religion and folk-lore,\r\nin ancient and modern times have been deeply tinged with pessimism. The\r\nsource of these gloomy views lies in the nature of man itself. Man has\r\ninherited a constitution from remote animal ancestors, and every part\r\nof his structure, physical, mental and emotional, is a complex legacy\r\nof diverse elements. Possibly at one time each quality had its purpose\r\nas an adaptation to environment, but, as man, in the course of his\r\nevolution, and the environment itself have changed, the old harmonious\r\nintercourse between quality and circumstances has been dislocated in\r\nmany cases. And so there have come into existence many instances of\r\nwhat the Professor calls “disharmony,” persistences of structures,\r\nor habits, or desires that are no longer useful, but even harmful,\r\nfailures of parallelism between the growth, maturity and decay of\r\nphysical and mental qualities and so forth. Religions and philosophies\r\nalike have failed to find remedies or efficient anodynes for these\r\nevils of existence, and, so far, man is justified of his historical and\r\nactual pessimism.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff, however, was able to proclaim himself an optimist, and\r\nfound, in biological science, for the present generation a hope, or,\r\nat the least, an end towards which to work, and for future generations\r\na possible achievement of that hope. Three chief evils that hang over\r\nus are disease, old age, and death. Modern science has already made\r\nvast strides towards the destruction of disease, and no one has more\r\nright to be listened to than a leader of the Pasteur Institute when he\r\nasserts his confidence that rational hygiene and preventive measures\r\nwill ultimately rid mankind of disease. The scientific investigation\r\nof old age shows that senility is nearly always precocious and\r\nthat its disabilities and miseries are for the most part due to\r\npreventable causes. Metchnikoff showed years ago that there exists in\r\nthe human body a number of cells known generally as phagocytes, the\r\nchief function of which is to devour intruding microbes. But these\r\nguardians of the body may turn into its deadly enemies by destroying\r\nand replacing the higher elements, the specific cells of the different\r\ntissues. The physical mechanism of senility appears to be in large\r\nmeasure the result of this process. Certain substances, notably the\r\npoisons of such diseases as syphilis and the products of intestinal\r\nputrefaction, stimulate the activity of the phagocytes and so encourage\r\ntheir encroachment on the higher tissues. The first business of science\r\nis to remove these handicaps in favour of the wandering, corroding\r\nphagocytes. Specific poisons must be dealt with separately, by\r\nprevention or treatment, and it is well known that Metchnikoff has\r\nmade great advances in that direction. The most striking practical\r\nside of _The Nature of Man_, however, was the discussion of the cause\r\nand prevention of intestinal putrefaction. Metchnikoff believes that\r\nthe inherited structure of the human large intestine and the customary\r\ndiet of civilised man are specially favourable to the multiplication\r\nof a large number of microbes that cause putrefaction. The avoidance\r\nof alcohol and the rigid exclusion from diet of foods that favour\r\nputrefaction, such as rich meats, and of raw or badly cooked substances\r\ncontaining microbes, do much to remedy the evils. But the special\r\nintroduction of the microbes which cause lactic fermentation has\r\nthe effect of inhibiting putrefaction. By such measures Metchnikoff\r\nbelieves that life will be greatly prolonged and that the chief evils\r\nof senility will be avoided. It may take many generations before the\r\nfinal result is attained, but, in the meantime, great amelioration is\r\npossible. There remains the last enemy, death. Metchnikoff shows that\r\nin the vast majority of cases death is not “natural,” but comes from\r\naccidental and preventable causes. When diseases have been suppressed\r\nand the course of life regulated by scientific hygiene, it is probable\r\nthat death would come only at an extreme old age. Metchnikoff thinks\r\nthat there is evidence enough at least to suggest that when death comes\r\nin its natural place at the end of the normal cycle of life, it would\r\nbe robbed of its terrors and be accepted as gratefully as any other\r\npart of the cycle of life. He thinks, in fact, that the instinct of\r\nlife would be replaced by an instinct of death.\r\n\r\nMetchnikoff’s suggestion, then, was that science should be encouraged\r\nand helped in every possible way in its task of removing the diseases\r\nand habits that now prevent human life from running its normal course,\r\nand his belief is that were the task accomplished, the great causes of\r\npessimism would disappear.\r\n\r\nIn this new volume, _The Prolongation of Life_, the main thesis is\r\ncarried further, and a number of criticisms and objections are met.\r\nThe latter, so far as they relate to technical details, I need say\r\nnothing of here, as Metchnikoff and his staff at the Pasteur Institute\r\nare the most skilled existing technical experts on these matters, but\r\nI cannot refrain from a word of comment on the brilliant treatment\r\nof the objection to the suggested amelioration of human life that it\r\nconsidered only the individual and neglected the just subordination\r\nof the individual to society. In the sixth Part of this volume,\r\nMetchnikoff discusses the relation of the individual to the species,\r\nsociety or colony, from the general point of view of comparative\r\nbiology, and shows that as organisation progresses, the integrity of\r\nthe individual becomes increasingly important. Were orthobiosis, the\r\nnormal cycle of life, attained by human beings, there still would be\r\nroom for specialisation of individuals and for differentiation of the\r\nfunctions of individuals in society, but instead of the specialisation\r\nand differentiation making individuals incomplete throughout their\r\nwhole lives, they would be distributed over the different periods of\r\nthe life of each individual.\r\n\r\nAs these lines are intended to be an introduction, not a commentary, I\r\nwill now leave the reader to follow the argument in the book itself.\r\n\r\n  P. CHALMERS MITCHELL.\r\n\r\n  LONDON, _August, 1907_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now four years since I wrote a volume, the English translation\r\nof which was called _The Nature of Man_, and which was an attempt to\r\nframe an optimistic conception of life. Human nature contains many\r\nvery complex elements, due to its animal ancestry, and amongst these\r\nthere are some disharmonies to which our misfortunes are due, but also\r\nelements which afford the promise of a happier human life.\r\n\r\nMy views have encountered many objections, and I wish to reply to some\r\nof these by developing my arguments. This was my first task in this\r\nbook, but I have also brought together a series of studies on problems\r\nwhich closely affect my theory.\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been possible to support my conception by new facts,\r\nsome of which have been established by my fellow-workers, others\r\nby myself, there still remain many sides of the subject where it\r\nis necessary to fall back on hypotheses. I have accepted such\r\nimperfections instead of delaying the publication of my book.\r\n\r\nEven at present there are critics who regard me as incapable of sane\r\nand logical reasoning. The longer I postpone publication, the longer\r\nwould I leave the field open to such persons. What I have been saying\r\nmay serve also as a reply to the remark of one of my critics, that my\r\nideas have been “suggested by self-preoccupation.”\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, quite natural that a biologist whose attention had\r\nbeen aroused by noticing in his own case the phenomena of precocious\r\nold age should turn to study the causes of it. But it is equally plain\r\nthat such a study could give no hope of resisting the decay of an\r\norganism which had already for many years been growing old. If the\r\nideas which have come out of my work bring about some modification in\r\nthe onset of old age, the advantage can be gained only by those who are\r\nstill young, and who will be at the pains to follow the new knowledge.\r\nThis volume, in fact, like my earlier one on the “Nature of Man,” is\r\ndirected much more to the new generation than to that which has already\r\nbeen subjected to the influence of the factors which produce precocious\r\nold age. I think that thus the experience of those who have lived and\r\nworked for long can be made of service to others.\r\n\r\nAs this volume is a sequel to _The Nature of Man_, I have tried as much\r\nas possible to avoid repetition of what was fully explained in the\r\nearlier volume.\r\n\r\nHere I bring together the results of work that has been done since the\r\npublication of _The Nature of Man_. Some of the chapters relate to\r\nsubjects upon which I have lectured, or which, in a different form,\r\nhave been printed before. For instance, the section on the psychic\r\nrudiments of man appeared in the _Bulletin de l’Institut général\r\npsychologique_ of 1904, the essay on Animal Societies was published in\r\nthe _Revue Philomatique de Bordeaux et du Sud-Ouest_ of 1904, and in\r\nthe _Revue_ of J. Finot of the same year, whilst a German translation\r\nof it appeared in Prof. Ostwald’s _Annalen der Naturphilosophie_. The\r\nchapter on soured milk first appeared as a pamphlet, published in\r\n1905. The substance of my views on natural death was published in June\r\nlast in “Harper’s Monthly Magazine” of New York, while the chapter on\r\nnatural death in animals appeared in the first number of the _Revue du\r\nMois_ for 1906.\r\n\r\nI have to thank most sincerely the friends and pupils who have helped\r\nme by bringing before me new facts, or other materials; the names\r\nof these will appear in their proper places in the volume. I have\r\nnot mentioned by name, however, Dr. J. Goldschmidt, whose continual\r\nencouragement and practical sympathy have made my work much easier.\r\n\r\nFinally, my special thanks are due to Drs. Em. Roux and Burnet, and\r\nM. Mesnil, who have been so good as to correct my manuscript and the\r\nproofs of this volume.\r\n\r\n  É.

AGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEMS OF SENILITY\r\n\r\n  Treatment of old people in uncivilised\r\n  countries—Assassination of old people in civilised\r\n  countries—Suicide of old people—Public assistance in\r\n  old age—Centenarians—Mme. Robineau, a lady of 106 years\r\n  of age—Principal characters of old age—Examples of old\r\n  mammals—Old birds and tortoises—Hypothesis of senile\r\n  degeneration in the lower animals\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the “Nature of Man” I laid down the outlines of a theory of the\r\nactual changes which take place during the senescence of our body.\r\nThese ideas, on the one hand, have raised certain difficulties, and, on\r\nthe other, have led to new investigations. As the study of old age is\r\nof great theoretical importance, and naturally is of practical value, I\r\nthink that it is useful to pursue the subject still further.\r\n\r\nAlthough there exist races which solve the difficulty of old age by\r\nthe simple means of destroying aged people, the problem in civilised\r\ncountries is complicated by our more refined feelings and by\r\nconsiderations of a general nature.\r\n\r\nIn the Melanesian Islands, old people who have become incapable of\r\ndoing useful work are buried alive.\r\n\r\nIn times of famine, the natives of Tierra del Fuego kill and eat the\r\nold women before they touch their dogs. When they were asked why they\r\ndid this, they said that dogs could catch seals, whilst old women could\r\nnot do so.\r\n\r\nCivilised races do not act like the Fuegians or other savages; they\r\nneither kill nor eat the aged, but none the less life in old age often\r\nbecomes very sad. As they are incapable of performing any useful\r\nfunction in the family or in the village, the old people are regarded\r\nas a heavy burden. Although they cannot be got rid of, their death is\r\nawaited with eagerness, and is never thought to come soon enough. The\r\nItalians say that old women have seven lives. According to a Bergamask\r\ntradition, old women have seven souls, and after that an eighth soul,\r\nquite a little one, and after that again half a soul; whilst the\r\nLithuanians complain that the life of an old woman is so tough that it\r\ncannot be crushed even in a mill. We may take it as an echo of such\r\npopular ideas that murders of old people are extremely common even\r\nin the most civilised European countries. I have been astonished in\r\nlooking through criminal records to see how many cases there are of the\r\nmurder of old people, specially of old women. It is easy to divine the\r\nmotives of these acts. A convict of the Island of Saghalien, condemned\r\nfor the assassination of several old persons, declared naïvely to the\r\nprison doctor: “Why pity them? They were already old, and would have\r\ndied in any case in a few years.”\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated novel of Dostoiewsky, “Crime and Punishment,” there\r\nis a tavern scene where young people discuss all sorts of general\r\ntopics. In the middle of the conversation a student declares that he\r\nwould “murder and rob any cursed old woman without the least remorse.”\r\n“If the truth were told,” he goes on to say, “this is how I look at\r\nthe thing. On the one hand a stupid old woman, childish, worthless,\r\nill-tempered, and in bad health; no one would miss her, indeed she is\r\na nuisance to everyone. She does not even herself know any reason why\r\nshe should live, and perhaps to-morrow death will make a good riddance\r\nof her. On the other hand, there are fresh and vigorous young people\r\nwho are dying in their thousands, in the most senseless way, no one\r\ntroubling about them, and everywhere the same thing is going on.”\r\n\r\nOld people not only run the risk of murder; they very often end their\r\nown lives prematurely by suicide.\r\n\r\nThey prefer death to a life oppressed by material hardships or burdened\r\nby diseases. The daily papers give many instances of old people who,\r\ntired of suffering, asphyxiate themselves by their charcoal stoves.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of suicide in the case of the old has been established\r\nby numerous statistics, and the new facts which I now cite do no more\r\nthan confirm it. In 1878, in Prussia, amongst 100,000 individuals there\r\nwere 154 cases of suicide of men between the ages of 20 and 50, but\r\n295, that is to say, nearly twice as many of men between the ages of 50\r\nand 80. In Denmark, a country in which suicide is notoriously common, a\r\nsimilar proportion exists. Thus, in Copenhagen, in the ten years from\r\n1886 to 1895, there were 394 suicides of men between 50 and 70. These\r\nfigures relate to 100,000 individuals. Of the suicides 36-1/2 per cent.\r\nwere those of people in the prime of life, 63-1/2 per cent. those of\r\nthe aged.[1]\r\n\r\nIn such circumstances, it is natural that politicians and\r\nphilanthropists have made many attempts to ameliorate the old age of\r\nthe poor. In some countries laws have been passed to bring about this.\r\nFor instance, a Danish law of June 27th, 1891, established compulsory\r\naid for the aged, enacting that every person more than 60 years old was\r\nto have the legal right to aid if required. In 1896 more than 36,000\r\npeople (36,246) were pensioned under this law, at a cost of nearly\r\n£200,000. In Belgium, the indigent old people are not pensioned until\r\nthey reach the age of 65. In France, until recently, the aged poor\r\ncould be supported at the public expense only by prosecuting them and\r\nsending them to prison for begging. This state of affairs, however,\r\nceased with the application of the law of July 15th, 1905, according to\r\nwhich any French subject without resources, unable to support himself\r\nby work, and either more than 70 years of age, or suffering from some\r\nincurable infirmity or disease, is to receive public assistance.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought the proper course to make such laws, and to lay\r\nthe burden on the general population, without inquiring if it may not\r\nbe possible to retard the debility of old age to such an extent that\r\nvery old people might still be able to earn their livelihood by work.\r\nOld age can be studied by the methods of exact science, and there may\r\nyet be established some regimen by which health and vigour will be\r\npreserved beyond the age where now it is generally necessary to resort\r\nto public charity. With this object, a systematic investigation of\r\nsenescence should be made in institutions for the aged, where there\r\nare always a large number of people from 75 to 90 years old, although\r\ncentenarians are extremely rare. I know many institutions for aged\r\nmen where, from their first foundation, there has been no case of an\r\ninhabitant reaching the age of 100, and even in similar institutions\r\nfor women, although women live to much greater ages than men,\r\ncentenarians are very rare. At the Salpêtrière, for instance, where\r\nthere is always a large number of old women, it is the rarest chance to\r\nfind a centenarian. Opportunity for the study of the extremely aged is\r\nto be found only in private families.\r\n\r\nMost of the centenarians whom I have been able to see have been so\r\ndefective mentally that all that can be studied in them are the\r\nphysical qualities and functions. A few years ago an old woman who\r\nhad reached her 100th year was the pride of the Salpêtrière. She was\r\nbedridden and extremely feeble physically and mentally. She replied\r\nbriefly when she was asked questions, but apparently without any idea\r\nof what they meant.\r\n\r\nNot long ago, a lady who lived in a suburb of Rouen reached her 100th\r\nbirthday. The local newspapers wrote exaggerated articles about her,\r\npraising the integrity of her mind and her physical strength. I paid\r\na visit to her myself, hoping to make a detailed investigation, but\r\nI found at once that the journalists had completely misrepresented\r\nher condition. Although her physical health was fairly good, her\r\nintelligence had degenerated to such an extent that I had to abandon\r\nthe idea of any serious investigation.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting of all the centenarians with whom I have become\r\nacquainted had reached an extremely advanced age, having entered upon\r\nher 107th year. It is about two years ago that a journalist, Monsieur\r\nFlamans, took me to see this Mme. Robineau who lived in a suburb of\r\nParis. I found her a very old-looking lady, rather short, thin, with a\r\nbent back, and leaning heavily on a cane when she walked. The physical\r\ncondition (Mme. Robineau was born on January 12th, 1800), of this\r\nwoman of more than 106 years, showed extreme decay. She had only one\r\ntooth; she had to sit down after every few steps, but, once comfortably\r\nseated, she could remain in that position for quite a long time. She\r\nwent to bed early and got up very late. Her features displayed very\r\ngreat age (see Fig. 1), although her skin was not extremely wrinkled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Mme. Robineau, a centenarian. From a photograph\r\ntaken on her one hundred and fifth birthday.]\r\n\r\nThe skin of her hands had become so transparent that one could see\r\nthe bones, the blood-vessels, and the tendons. Her senses were very\r\nfeeble; she could see only with one eye; taste and smell were extremely\r\nrudimentary; her hearing was her best means of relation with the\r\nexternal world. None the less, Dr. Löwenberg, a well-known aurist,\r\nhad assured himself that her auditory organs showed in a most marked\r\ndegree, the usual signs of old age, such as complete insensibility to\r\nhigh notes and slight deafness for low notes. Dr. Löwenberg attributed\r\nthese changes to senile degeneration of the ear which affected more\r\nand more seriously the nervous mechanism although it had caused little\r\nchange in the conducting apparatus. Notwithstanding her physical\r\nweakness, Mme. Robineau retained her intelligence fully, her mind\r\nremained delicate and refined and the goodness of her heart was\r\ntouching. In contrast with the usual selfishness of old people, Mme.\r\nRobineau took a vivid interest in those around her. Her conversation\r\nwas intelligent, connected, and logical. Examination of the physical\r\nfunctions of this old lady revealed facts of great interest. Dr.\r\nAmbard found that the sounds of the heart were normal, but perhaps a\r\nlittle accentuated. The pulse was regular, 70 to 84 a minute, and its\r\ntension was normal. The arterial pressure was 17. The lungs were sound.\r\nAll these facts testify to her general health. The most remarkable\r\ncircumstance was the absence of sclerosis of the arteries, although\r\nsuch degeneration is usually believed to be a normal character of old\r\nage.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the urine, made on several occasions, showed that the\r\nkidneys were affected with a chronic disease, which, however, was not\r\nserious.[2]\r\n\r\nAlthough the sense of taste was weak, Madame Robineau had a fair\r\nappetite. She ate and drank little, but her diet was varied. She\r\ntook butcher’s meat or chicken extremely seldom, but ate eggs, fish,\r\nfarinaceous food, vegetables, and stewed fruit, and drank sweetened\r\nwater with a little white wine, and sometimes, after a meal, a small\r\nglass of dessert wine. The processes of alimentary digestion and\r\nexcretion were normal.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been thought that duration of life is a hereditary\r\nproperty. There was no evidence for this in the present case. Madame\r\nRobineau’s relatives had died comparatively early in life, and a\r\ncentenarian was unknown in her family. Her great age was an acquired\r\ncharacter. Her whole life had been extremely regular. She had married a\r\ntimber merchant, and had lived for many years in a suburb of Paris in\r\ncomfortable circumstances. Her character was gentle and affectionate;\r\nshe was thoroughly domesticated, and had been devoted to home life with\r\nvery few distractions.\r\n\r\nAt the age of 106 years, her intelligence suddenly became weak. She\r\nlost her memory almost completely, and sometimes wandered. But her\r\ngentle and affectionate disposition remained unaltered.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of aged persons is too well known to make detailed\r\ndescription necessary. The skin of the face is dry and wrinkled and\r\ngenerally pale; the hairs on the head and the body are white; the back\r\nis bent, and the gait is slow and laborious, whilst the memory is weak.\r\nSuch are the most familiar traits of old age. Baldness is not a special\r\ncharacter; it often begins during youth and naturally is progressive,\r\nbut if it has not already appeared, it does not come on with old age.\r\n\r\nThe stature diminishes in old age. As the result of a series of\r\nobservations, it has been established that a man loses more than an\r\ninch (3·166 cm.), and a woman more than an inch and a half (4·3 cm.),\r\nbetween the ages of fifty and eighty-five years. In extreme cases,\r\nthe loss may be nearly three inches. The weight also becomes less.\r\nAccording to Quételet, males attain their maximum weights at the age of\r\nforty, females at that of fifty. From the age of sixty years onwards,\r\nthe body becomes lighter, the loss at eighty being as much as thirteen\r\npounds.\r\n\r\nSuch losses of height and weight are signs of the general atrophy of\r\nthe aged organism. Not merely the soft parts, such as the muscles and\r\nviscera, but even the bones lose weight, in the latter case the loss\r\nbeing of the mineral constituents. This process of decalcification\r\nmakes the skeleton brittle, and is sometimes the cause of fatal\r\naccidents.\r\n\r\nThe loss of muscular tissue is specially great. The volume diminishes,\r\nand the substance becomes paler; the fat between the fibres is\r\nabsorbed, and may disappear completely. Movements are slower, and\r\nthe muscular force is abated. This progressive degeneration has been\r\nexamined by dynamometrical measurements of the hand and the trunk, and\r\nis greater in males than in females.\r\n\r\nThe volumes and weights of the visceral organs similarly become\r\nsmaller, but the diminution is not uniform.\r\n\r\nThe old age of lower mammals presents characters similar to those found\r\nin man. I can now give other instances than the case of the old dog\r\nwhich I described in the “Nature of Man.”\r\n\r\nI will first take the case of old elephants, described by a competent\r\nobserver. “The general appearance is wretched, the skull being often\r\nhardly covered with skin; there are deep abrasions under the eyes, and\r\nsmaller ones on the cheeks, whilst the skin of the forehead is very\r\noften deeply fissured or covered with lumps. The eyes are usually dim,\r\nand discharge an abnormal quantity of water. The margin of the ears,\r\nspecially on the lower side, is usually frayed. The skin of the trunk\r\nis roughened, hard, and warty, so that the organ has lost much of its\r\nflexibility. The skin on the body generally is worn and wrinkled; the\r\nlegs are thinner than in maturity, the huge mass of muscles being much\r\nshrunken, whilst the circumference, especially just above the feet, is\r\nconsiderably reduced. The skin round the toe-nails is roughened and\r\nfrayed. The tail is scaly and hard, and the tip is often hairless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—A Mare, thirty-seven years old.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—A White Duck, which lived for more than a\r\nquarter of a century.]\r\n\r\nHorses begin to grow old much sooner than elephants. I reproduce (Fig.\r\n2) the photograph of a rare instance of longevity, a mare 37 years\r\nold, which belonged to M. Métaine, in the department of Mayenne. The\r\nskin, bare in places, but elsewhere covered with long hairs, shows\r\nconsiderable atrophy. The general attitude reveals the feebleness\r\nof the whole body. Many birds, on the other hand, show at similar\r\nages very slight external change, as may be seen from the photograph\r\nof a duck more than 25 years old (Fig. 3) which belonged to Dr.\r\nJean Charcot. At a still greater age, as may be seen occasionally\r\nin parrots, the general debility of the body reveals itself in the\r\nattitude, in the condition of the feathers, and in the swelling of the\r\njoints. On the other hand, the oldest reptiles which have been observed\r\ndo not differ in appearance from normal adults of the same species. I\r\nhave in my possession a male tortoise (_Testudo mauritanica_) given me\r\nby my friends MM. Rabaud and Caullery, and which is at least 86 years\r\nold. It shows no sign of old age, and in all respects behaves like\r\nany other individual of this species. More than 31 years ago it was\r\nwounded by a blow, the traces of which remain visible on the right side\r\nof the carapace (Fig. 4). In the last three years the tortoise lived in\r\na garden at Montauban, along with two females which laid fertile eggs.\r\nThe old male, although, as I have said, probably at least 86 years of\r\nage, was still sexually healthy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—An Old Land-tortoise.]\r\n\r\nI have borrowed from the interesting volume of Prof. Sir E. Ray\r\nLankester[3] the figure (Fig. 5) and description of a giant tortoise\r\nfrom the island of Mauritius, which is probably the oldest of all\r\nliving animals. It was brought to Mauritius from the Seychelles in\r\n1764, and has lived since then in the garden of the Governor, and as it\r\nhas thus already been 140 years in captivity, its age must be at least\r\n150 years, although we have not exact information. Notwithstanding\r\nthis, it shows no signs of old age.\r\n\r\nThe examples which I have brought together show that often amongst\r\nvertebrates there are some animals the organisms of which withstand\r\nthe ravages of time much better than that of man. I think it a fair\r\ninference that senility, the precocious senescence which is one of\r\nthe greatest sorrows of humanity, is not so profoundly seated in the\r\nconstitution of the higher animals as has generally been supposed. It\r\nis not necessary, therefore, to discuss at length the general question\r\nas to whether senile degeneration is an inevitable event in living\r\norganisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—A Water-tortoise, more than 150 years old.\r\n\r\n(After Prof. Sir E. Ray Lankester.)]\r\n\r\nI have already shown, in the “Nature of Man,” the difference which\r\nexists between senile degeneration in our own bodies and the phenomena\r\nof senescence amongst Infusoria which, as M. Maupas described, are\r\nfollowed by a process of rejuvenescence. According to the more recent\r\nresults of several investigators, the difference is still greater than\r\nI had supposed. Enriquez[4] has been able to propagate Infusoria to\r\nthe 700th generation without any sign of senility being displayed. Here\r\nwe are far from the condition in the human race.\r\n\r\nR. Hertwig,[5] one of the best observers of the lower animals, has\r\nrecently attempted to show that the very simple animalculæ of the genus\r\n_Actinosphærium_ are subject to true physiological degeneration. He\r\nhas several times seen cultures of this Rhizopod degenerate, until all\r\nthe individuals had died, notwithstanding the presence of abundant\r\nfood. Prof. Hertwig attributed this to the “constitution of the\r\n_Actinosphærium_ having been weakened by too great vital activity\r\nat an earlier stage.” I should have thought that it was a much more\r\nnatural explanation to suppose that the culture had undergone infection\r\nby one of the contagious diseases which so often destroy cultures of\r\ndifferent kinds of lower animals and plants. As this idea had not\r\noccurred to the observer, he had not searched for parasitic microbes\r\namongst the granulations which are always present in the body of an\r\n_Actinosphærium_. However this may be, I cannot accept the facts\r\nbrought forward by this distinguished German as a valid proof of the\r\nexistence of senile degeneration in these lowly creatures.\r\n\r\nThe facts that I have brought together in this chapter justify the\r\nconclusion that human beings who reach extreme old age may preserve\r\ntheir mental qualities notwithstanding serious physical decay.\r\nMoreover, it is equally plain that the organism of some vertebrates is\r\nable to resist the influence of time much longer than is the case with\r\nman under present conditions.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF CAUSATION OF SENILITY\r\n\r\n  Hypothesis of the causation of senility—Senility\r\n  cannot be attributed to the cessation of the power\r\n  of reproduction of the cells of the body—Growth of\r\n  the hair and the nails in old age—Inner mechanism of\r\n  the senescence of the tissues—Notwithstanding the\r\n  criticisms of M. Marinesco, the neuronophags are true\r\n  phagocytes—The whitening of hair and the destruction of\r\n  nerve cells, as arguments against a theory of old age\r\n  based on the failure of the reproductive powers of the\r\n  cells\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it has not been proved that living matter must inevitably\r\nundergo senile decrepitude, it is none the less true that man and his\r\nnearest allies generally exhibit such degeneration. It is therefore\r\nextremely important to recognise the real causes of our senescence.\r\nThere have been many hypotheses on the subject, but there are\r\ncomparatively few definite facts known.\r\n\r\nBütschli has supposed that the life of cells is maintained by a\r\nspecific vital ferment which becomes feebler in proportion to the\r\nextent of cellular reproduction, but I cannot regard this as more than\r\na pious opinion. The ferment has never been seen, and we do not know\r\nof its actual existence. According to the better-known theory of Prof.\r\nWeismann, old age depends on a limitation in the power of cells to\r\nreproduce, so that a time comes when the body can no longer replace\r\nthe wastage of cells which is an inevitable accompaniment of life. As\r\nold age appears at different times in different species and different\r\nindividuals, Weismann has concluded that the possible number of cell\r\ngenerations differs in different cases. He has not found, however,\r\na solution of the problem as to why multiplication of cells should\r\ncease in one individual, whereas it proceeds much further in other\r\nindividuals. Prof. Minot,[6] the American zoologist, has developed\r\na similar theory, and has employed an exact method to determine the\r\ngradual diminution in the rate of growth of an animal from its birth\r\nonwards. According to him, the power of reproduction of the cells\r\nweakens progressively during life, until a point is necessarily reached\r\nat which the organism, no longer capable of repairing itself, begins to\r\natrophy and degenerate. Dr. Buehler[7] has recently laid stress upon\r\nthis theory.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that cells reproduce much more actively during the\r\nembryonic period. The process becomes slower later on, but, none the\r\nless, continues to display itself throughout the whole period of life.\r\nBuehler attributes the difficulty with which certain wounds heal in the\r\ncase of old people to the insufficiency of cellular reproduction. He\r\nthinks in particular that the proliferation of the cells of the skin,\r\nto replace those which are worn off from the surface, becomes less\r\nactive with age. According to him, it is theoretically obvious that a\r\ntime must come when the replacement of the epidermic cells completely\r\nceases. As the superficial layers of the skin continue to dry up and\r\nbe cast off, it is plain that the epidermis must disappear completely.\r\nBuehler thinks that there must be a similar fate for the genital\r\nglands, the muscles, and all the other organs.\r\n\r\nThese theoretical considerations, however, are not compatible with\r\ncertain well-known facts indicating that there is no general cessation\r\nof the power of cell reproduction in old age. The hairs and the nails,\r\nwhich are epidermic outgrowths, continue to grow throughout life, their\r\ngrowth being due to the proliferation of their constituent cells. There\r\nis no sign of any arrest in the development of these structures, even\r\nin the most advanced old age. The reverse is true. It is well known\r\nthat the hairs on some parts of the body increase in number and in\r\nlength in old people. In some lower races, for instance in the Mongols,\r\nthe moustache and the beard grow vigorously in old age, whilst young\r\npeople of the same race have only very small moustaches and practically\r\nno trace of beard. So also in white women the fine and almost invisible\r\ndown which covers the upper lip, the chin, and the cheeks in the young\r\nmay become replaced by long hairs which form a moustache or beard.\r\n\r\nDr. Pohl, a specialist in the growth of hair, has measured the rate of\r\ngrowth in different circumstances. He has shown that in an old man of\r\n61 the hair on the temple grew 11 mm. in a month; on the other hand,\r\nthe hair on the same region in boys of 11 to 15 years old grew in\r\nthe same time only from 11 to 12 mm. Plainly, there is no case here\r\nof a progressive diminution of cell-proliferation with age. The same\r\nobserver, it is true, has shown that the hair of young men of between\r\n21 and 24 years grew at the rate of 15 mm. a month, whilst in the same\r\nindividuals, at the age of 61 years, the rate of growth was only 11\r\nmm.; but this diminution in the rate of growth is only apparent. The\r\nfirst figure concerned the hair taken from different regions of the\r\nscalp, whilst the second related only to the hair on the temples, and\r\nDr. Pohl himself has shown that, in the latter region, the hair grows\r\nslower than in other regions. Moreover, in many boys of 11 to 15 years\r\nold, studied by this observer, the rate of growth was always less than\r\n15 mm., and often less even than the 11 mm. recorded in the old man of\r\n61.\r\n\r\nI have been able to note that the nails grow even in very old people.\r\nIn the case of Mme. Robineau, the centenarian, the nail of the middle\r\nfinger of the left hand grew 2-1/2 mm. in three weeks. In the case of a\r\nlady of 32 years old, the corresponding nail grew 3 mm. in two weeks,\r\nthe difference being out of all proportion to the enormous difference\r\nin the age. The centenarian’s nails had to be cut from time to time.\r\n\r\nAlthough the hairs of old people grow, they become white, which is a\r\nphenomenon of senile degeneration. Although they increase in length,\r\nthe colouring matter in them becomes reduced and finally disappears.\r\nIn the “Nature of Man” I described the process by which this blanching\r\ntakes place, and which may now be regarded as definitely proved. It is\r\nuseful as a means of interpreting the real nature of the process of\r\nsenescence. In several published works, I have explained my belief that\r\njust as the pigment of the hair is destroyed by phagocytes, so also the\r\natrophy of other organs of the body, in old age, is very frequently\r\ndue to the action of devouring cells which I have called macrophags.\r\nThese are the phagocytes that destroy the higher elements of the body,\r\nsuch as the nervous and muscular cells, and the cells of the liver and\r\nkidneys. This part of my theory has encountered very strong criticism,\r\nespecially with regard to the part played by the macrophags in the\r\nsenescence of nervous tissue.\r\n\r\nNeurologists in particular, have criticised my interpretation. For\r\nseveral years M. Marinesco[8] has attacked my theory of the atrophy\r\nof the nerve-cells in old age. In the first place, he has stated that\r\nin old people, and even if these are very old, it is rare to find\r\nphagocytes surrounding and devouring the cells of the brain. In support\r\nof this contention, he has been good enough to send me two preparations\r\nmade from the brains of two very old persons. After careful examination\r\nI was convinced that my opponent had been inexact. In the brain of the\r\ntwo centenarians (one of whom died at the age of 117 years) there were\r\nvery many nerve-cells surrounded by phagocytes and in process of being\r\ndestroyed by them. It happened, however, that as the sections were very\r\nweakly stained, it was more difficult to observe the facts than in the\r\npreparations upon which I had made my own observations. I have already\r\nrecorded this fact in the second and third French editions of the\r\n“Nature of Man.”\r\n\r\nWithout taking notice of my reply, M. Marinesco has published another\r\ncriticism of my theory in an article[9] entitled “Histological\r\nInvestigations into the Mechanism of Senility.” In that work, although\r\nhe himself had invented the designation “neuronophag” for a phagocyte\r\nthat devours nerve-cells, he denies the existence of such a power.\r\nHe thinks that nerve-cells atrophy independently of the cells that\r\nsurround them. The latter, the so-called neuronophags, only contribute\r\nto the atrophy inasmuch as they press against the nerve-cells and\r\ndeprive them of nutrition. He is confident that the constituent parts\r\nof nerve-cells are never found in the neuronophags. There is no\r\nquestion of phagocytosis, of the existence of cells that devour their\r\nneighbours.\r\n\r\nM. Léri has taken a similar view in a Report on the Senile Brain[10]\r\npresented to a recent congress of alienists and neurologists.\r\nAccording to him “the nuclei which surround some of the atrophying\r\nnerve-cells do not play the part of neuronophags.” In his monograph\r\n“La Neuronophagie,”[11] M. Sand elaborates the same view. He relies\r\non his observation that “neuronophags are usually either devoid\r\nof protoplasm or display only a very thin layer of it. They never\r\nexhibit protoplasmic outgrowths, and they never have granules in their\r\ncellular bodies (p. 86).” Still more recently MM. Laignel-Lavastine and\r\nVoisin[12] have taken the same view, maintaining that the neuronophags\r\ndo not display phagocytosis.\r\n\r\nAlthough I cannot undertake here to give a detailed reply to the\r\narguments of my critics, I may point out a fallacy that vitiates\r\ntheir reasoning. The study of the intimate structure of nervous\r\ntissue involves the treatment of that very delicate substance by\r\nnumerous active reagents. It is extremely important not to forget the\r\npossibility of alterations which may be produced in the processes of\r\npreparation and which are extremely difficult to avoid. A glance at\r\nthe figures given by my critics shows me that the neuronophags in\r\ntheir preparations had been subjected to violent treatment. When M.\r\nLéri speaks of “the nuclei which surround some of the nerve-cells,”\r\nand M. Sand of “cells without protoplasm,” it is clear that they had\r\nbeen observing cells destroyed by the processes of the laboratory.\r\nThe illustrations in the memoir of M. Marinesco show that in his\r\npreparations, too, the neuronophags had been very greatly altered.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that nuclei do not exist free in tissues, and that\r\nwhen they appear devoid of protoplasm, there has been some defect in\r\nthe technical methods of preparing them for examination. As a matter\r\nof fact, neuronophags do not consist of nuclei with at the most a\r\npellicle of protoplasm; like other cells, they have protoplasmic bodies\r\nwhich, however, are frequently destroyed by the violent processes of\r\nhistological preparation.\r\n\r\nThe arguments of my critics recall to me the words of a medical\r\nstudent, who, on being asked to describe the microbe of tuberculosis,\r\nsaid that it was a little red bacillus. The bacillus in question, like\r\nmost bacilli, is colourless, but it is usual to stain it so that it\r\nmay be visible under the microscope. The student, knowing it only in\r\nparticular preparations, had a false idea of its appearance.\r\n\r\nIn well-made preparations, neuronophags are typical cells with abundant\r\nprotoplasm. When they have been preserved by a process that does\r\nnot dissolve their contents, they show granules like those found in\r\nnerve-cells.\r\n\r\nTo study neuronophagy, M. Manouélian,[13] in the laboratory of the\r\nPasteur Institute in Paris, set himself to improve the technical\r\nmethods of preparation. He succeeded in showing first that in the\r\ndestruction of nerve-cells that occurs in cases of hydrophobia, the\r\ncontents of these cells are absorbed by the surrounding neuronophags.\r\n“My observations on the cerebro-spinal ganglia of human cases of\r\nhydrophobia,” he wrote, “show clearly that the macrophags act as\r\nphagocytes of the nerve-cells.” “Most of the cells in the nerve-ganglia\r\ncontain yellow, brown, and black pigmented granules, usually united\r\nin small masses. What becomes of these granulations on the destruction\r\nand disappearance of the nerve-cell? If, as M. Marinesco has it, there\r\nis no phagocytosis by the surrounding cells, but merely a mechanical\r\ninterference, then the granules, on the destruction of the nerve-cells\r\nthat contained them, should be found lying in the interstitial tissue.\r\nBut this does not happen. The granules are ingested by cells which are\r\ntrue macrophags.”\r\n\r\nBy the aid of a very delicate mode of preparation, M. Manouélian has\r\nshown that in the case of senile brains the granules of the nerve-cells\r\nare absorbed by neuronophags. I have myself studied M. Manouélian’s\r\npreparations and can testify to the accuracy of his observations (Figs.\r\n6 and 7).\r\n\r\nDoubt is no longer possible. In senile degeneration the nerve-cells are\r\nsurrounded by neuronophags which absorb their contents and bring about\r\nmore or less complete atrophy. It has been supposed that in order to\r\ndevour their contents, the neuronophags must penetrate the nerve-cells,\r\nand such an event has rarely been seen. But it is well known, the\r\nphagocytosis of red blood corpuscles being a typical instance, that\r\nto absorb a cell a phagocyte does not necessarily engulf it bodily or\r\npenetrate it, but may gradually denude it of its contents merely by\r\nresting in contact with it.\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion as to the condition of nerve-cells which\r\nare on the point of being devoured by neuronophags. It has been noticed\r\nthat such cells may display a considerable amount of degeneration\r\nwithout being devoured, whilst, on the other hand, cells apparently\r\nnormal have been found undergoing phagocytosis. As I cannot state\r\ndefinitely what are the conditions that induce the phagocytosis of\r\nnerve-cells, I shall not attempt a discussion of the problem.\r\n\r\nAlthough the destruction of nerve-cells by neuronophags is a general\r\noccurrence in senile brains, one may conceive of cases where this does\r\nnot occur. And so, in old people who have preserved their faculties,\r\nit may well be that the neuronophags have refrained from attacking the\r\nnerve-cells. But as such instances are rare, so also phagocytosis is\r\nusually found in senile brains, and I cannot accept M. Sand’s denial of\r\nits existence, based on his study of two cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.\r\n\r\nFIGS. 6. & 7.—Two nerve-cells from the cortex of the brain of an old\r\ndog aged fifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe neuronophags surrounding the nerve-cells contain numerous\r\ngranulations.\r\n\r\n(From preparations made by M. Manouélian.)]\r\n\r\nThe general result of my investigation into the criticisms that\r\nhave been published on this matter has confirmed me in my belief\r\nthat neuronophagy plays a most important part in senescence, and\r\nrecent observations that I have made with M. Weinberg have completely\r\nsupported this view.\r\n\r\nThe bleaching of hair and the atrophy of the brain in old age thus\r\nfurnish important arguments against the view that senescence is the\r\nresult of arrest of the reproductive powers of cells. Hairs grow old\r\nand become white without ceasing to grow. The cessation of the power of\r\nreproduction cannot be the cause of the senescence of brain-cells, for\r\nthese cells do not reproduce even in youth.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF SENILITY\r\n\r\n  Action of the macrophags in destroying the higher\r\n  cells—Senile degeneration of muscular fibres—Atrophy\r\n  of the skeleton—Atheroma and arterial sclerosis—Theory\r\n  that old age is due to alteration in the vascular\r\n  glands—Organic tissues that resist phagocytosis\r\n\r\n\r\nThe instances which I have selected in attempting to describe the\r\nmechanism of senescence of the tissues are not the only cases in which\r\nthe importance of phagocytosis is evident. The blanching of hair is\r\ndue to the destructive agency of chromophags; in atrophy of the brain\r\nneuronophags destroy the higher nerve-cells. In addition to these\r\ninstances of phagocytosis, in which the active agents belong to the\r\ncategory of macrophags, there are many other devouring cells, adrift\r\nin the tissues of the aged, and ready to cause destruction of other\r\ncells of the higher type. The phagocytic action is not so manifest as\r\nin the case of infectious diseases, partly because it is the method of\r\nmacrophags to absorb the contents of the higher cells extremely slowly.\r\nThe mode of action is well seen in the atrophy of an egg-cell (Fig. 8),\r\nwhere the surrounding macrophags gradually seize hold of the granules\r\nwithin it and carry these off. As the process goes on, the ovum becomes\r\nreduced to a shapeless mass, and finally leaves only a few fragments,\r\nor disappears completely. M. Matchinsky[14] has studied the series of\r\nevents in my laboratory, and I am myself well assured of the importance\r\nof the action of macrophags in the atrophy of the ovary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Ovum of a Bitch in process of destruction by\r\nPhagocytes, which are full of fatty granules.\r\n\r\n(After M. Matchinsky.)]\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of atrophy in general and of senile decay afford other\r\ncases of tissue destruction in which the phagocytic character of the\r\nprocess is more modified and obscure than in nerve-cells and ova.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that progressive muscular debility is an accompaniment\r\nof old age. Physical work is seldom given to men over sixty years\r\nof age, as it is notorious that they are less capable of it. Their\r\nmuscular movements are feebler and soon bring on fatigue; their actions\r\nare slow and painful. Even old men whose mental vigour is unimpaired\r\nadmit their muscular weakness. The physical correlate of this\r\ncondition is an actual atrophy of the muscles, and has for long been\r\nknown to observers. More than half a century ago, Kölliker,[15] one of\r\nthe founders of histology, devoted some attention to this matter, and\r\ndescribed the senile modification of muscular tissue in the following\r\nwords:—“In old age there is a true atrophy of the muscles. The fibres\r\nare much more slender; there are deposited in their substance numerous\r\nyellow or brown granules and many globular nuclei. These nuclei are\r\nfrequently arranged in longitudinal series and present such signs of\r\nactive division as are found in embryonic tissue.”\r\n\r\nOther investigators afterwards made similar observations. Vulpian[16]\r\nand Douaud[17] have stated that a multiplication of nuclei takes places\r\nin the atrophying muscles of the old.\r\n\r\nAs the senile degeneration of muscular tissue appeared to be important\r\nin my study of the mechanism of senescence, M. Weinberg and I\r\nexamined several cases of muscular atrophy in old human beings and\r\nlower animals. We were able to recognise the phenomena observed by\r\nour predecessors. In senile atrophy the muscular fibres contain many\r\nnuclei, and these, increasing rapidly, bring about an almost complete\r\ndisappearance of the contractile substance (Fig. 9). The fibres\r\npreserve their striation for a certain time but eventually lose it and\r\nappear to contain an amorphous mass with numerous, rapidly multiplying\r\nnuclei.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Degeneration of striated muscle Fibres from the\r\nauricular muscle of a man aged 87 years.\r\n\r\n(From a preparation made by Dr. Weinberg.)]\r\n\r\nThe investigators who had recorded these facts thought of them only as\r\ncurious. It is plain, in the first place, however, that this remarkable\r\nand rapid multiplication is a proof that senile atrophy is not due to\r\nfailure of cell proliferation, although the latter has frequently been\r\nsuggested as the mechanism of senescence. In muscular atrophy, cell\r\nmultiplication, so far from failing, greatly increases. We may add\r\nmuscular atrophy to the blanching of hair and the decay of nerve-cells\r\nas another instance showing that senile degeneration is not the result\r\nof cells ceasing to be able to multiply. Just as in the atrophy\r\nof the brain there is an increase in the volume of neuroglœa,\r\nthe substance in which the neuronophags are found, so also in the\r\natrophy of the muscles there is an increase of muscular nuclei. Along\r\nwith the increase of nuclei, however, there is an increase of the\r\nprotoplasmic substance of the fibres known as sarcoplasm. The latter\r\nreplaces the myoplasm, the specific striated substance of muscles, by\r\na process which must be regarded as parallel with phagocytosis. In a\r\nnormal muscle the two substances and the sarcoplasmic nuclei are in\r\nequilibrium, but in old age the sarcoplasm and its nuclei increase at\r\nthe expense of the myoplasm. The equilibrium is destroyed with the\r\nresult that the muscular power is weakened. In these conditions the\r\nsarcoplasm acts phagocytically with regard to the myoplasm, just as the\r\nchromophag becomes the phagocyte of the pigment of the hair, or the\r\nneuronophag devours the nerve-cell.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of other cases of muscular atrophy, as, for instance,\r\nthat of the caudal muscles of frog-tadpoles, confirms the significance\r\nof the process that I have observed in old age. In the two cases, what\r\ntakes place is the destruction of the contractile material of the\r\nmuscles by myophags, a special kind of phagocyte.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the curiosities of senile atrophy that whilst there is\r\nhardening or sclerosis of so many organs, the skeleton, the most\r\nsolid part of our frame-work, becomes less dense, so that the bones\r\nare friable, the condition often leading to serious accidents in old\r\npeople. The bones become porous, and lose weight. It is difficult to\r\nbelieve that macrophags, although they destroy softer elements such\r\nas nerve-cells or muscle fibres, can be able to gnaw through a hard\r\nmaterial like bone impregnated with mineral salts. As a matter of fact,\r\nthe mechanism of bone atrophy must be placed in a different category\r\nfrom the phagocytosis of other organs. It is brought about, however,\r\nby the agency of cells very like some of the macrophags. These cells\r\ncontain many nuclei, and are known as osteoclasts. They form round\r\nabout the bony lamellæ and lead to their destruction, but are incapable\r\nof breaking off fragments of bone and dissolving them in their\r\ninteriors. Although the intimate mechanism of this destructive action\r\nis not thoroughly understood, it seems probable that the cells secrete\r\nsome acid which softens bone by dissolving the lime salts. The process\r\ncan be observed in the different varieties of caries of the bone, and\r\nin the bony atrophy of old age as is represented in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\nBy the action of the osteoclasts, which themselves are macrophags, part\r\nof the lime in the skeleton is dissolved during old age and passes into\r\nthe general circulation. This is probably a source of the lime which is\r\ndeposited so readily in the different tissues of old people. Whilst the\r\nbones become lighter, the cartilages become bony, the inter-vertebrate\r\ndiscs in particular becoming impregnated with salts, so that the\r\nwell-known senile malformation of the backbone is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Destruction by osteoclasts of bony matter in\r\nthe sternum of a man aged 81 years.\r\n\r\n(From a preparation made by Dr. Weinberg.)]\r\n\r\nAs a result of this displacement of lime in old age, the blood-vessels\r\nbecome modified in a distinctive fashion. Atheroma of the arteries\r\nis not invariable in old people, but it occurs extremely frequently.\r\nIn this form of degeneration, lime salts are deposited in the walls\r\nof the cells, so that they become hard and friable. Several others,\r\namong whom I may mention Durand-Fardel and Sauvage, have laid stress\r\non the coincidence of atheromatous lesions of the arteries and senile\r\ndegeneration of the bones. The relations between the two alterations\r\nare very evident in the skull; the meningeal artery becomes sinuous and\r\natheromatous, and the grooves on the inner side of the bones of the\r\nskull in which it runs, flatten out, and become larger because of other\r\nmalformations.[18]\r\n\r\nThere is no disharmony in the nature of old people so striking as this\r\ntransference of the lime salts from the skeleton to the blood-vessels,\r\nproducing as it does a dangerous softening of the former, and a\r\nhardening of the latter that interferes with their function of carrying\r\nnutrition to the organs. It is the manifestation of an extraordinary\r\ndisturbance of the properties of the cells that compose the body. The\r\natheromatous condition of the arteries is closely linked with arterial\r\nsclerosis, an affection which is very common, although not constant,\r\nin the aged. The whole question of these vascular alterations is\r\nextremely complex, and before it can be cleared up, a number of special\r\ninvestigations must be made.\r\n\r\nProbably diseases of the arteries of different kinds, and arising from\r\ndifferent causes, are grouped under the terms atheroma and sclerosis.\r\nIn some cases the lesions are inflammatory and are due to the poisons\r\nof microbes. An example of such an origin is the case of syphilitic\r\nsclerosis, in which the specific microbes (spirilla of Schaudinn) lead\r\nto precocious senescence. In other cases the arteries show phenomena of\r\ndegeneration resulting in the formation of calcareous platelets which\r\ninterfere with the circulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nInvestigations which have been made in recent years have led to very\r\ninteresting results concerning the origin of atheroma of the arteries.\r\nIn most cases, attempts to produce such lesions of the arteries by\r\nexperimental methods have not succeeded, but M. Josué[19] has been\r\nable to produce true arterial atheroma in rabbits by injecting into\r\nthem adrenaline, the secretion of the supra-renal capsules.\r\n\r\nThis experiment has been repeated many times and is now well known.\r\nLater on, M. Boveri[20] obtained a similar result by injecting\r\nnicotine, the poison of tobacco. It is obvious, therefore, that amongst\r\nthe arterial diseases which play so great a part in senescence, some\r\nare chronic inflammations produced by microbes, whilst others are\r\nbrought about by poisons introduced from without.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand, therefore, why these diseases of the arteries\r\nare not always present in old age, although they are very common.\r\n\r\nThe part played by the secretion of the supra-renal glands in the\r\nproduction of arterial disease has brought renewed attention to a\r\ntheory which supposed that certain glandular organs in the body play\r\na preponderating part in senile degeneration. Dr. Lorand[21] in\r\nparticular has argued that “senility is a morbid process due to the\r\ndegeneration of the thyroid gland and of other ductless glands which\r\nnormally regulate the nutrition of the body.” It has long been noticed\r\nthat persons affected with myxodema, as a result of the degeneration\r\nof the thyroid gland, look like very old people. Everyone who has seen\r\nthe cretins in Savoy, Switzerland, or the Tyrol, must have noticed the\r\naged appearance of these victims, although very often they are quite\r\nyoung. The condition of cretinism, with its profound bodily changes,\r\nis the result of degeneration of the thyroid gland. On the other hand,\r\nit is well known that in old people the thyroid and the suprarenals\r\nfrequently show cystic degeneration. It is quite probable, therefore,\r\nthat these so-called vascular glands have their share in producing\r\nsenility. Many facts show that they destroy certain poisons which have\r\nentered the body, and it is easy to see that, if they have become\r\nfunctionless, the tissues are threatened with poisoning. It does not\r\nfollow, however, that their action in producing senility is exclusive,\r\nor even preponderating. M. Weinberg, at the Pasteur Institute, made\r\nspecial investigations on this point, and found that the thyroid gland\r\nand the supra-renal capsules were almost invariably normal in old\r\nanimals (cat, dog, horse), although the latter showed unmistakable\r\nsigns of senility. Similarly in an old man of 80 years, who died from\r\npneumonia, the thyroid gland was quite normal.\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the aged very often die from infectious\r\ndiseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, and erysipelas. In these\r\ndiseases the vascular glands generally, and the thyroid gland in\r\nparticular, are very often affected, with the result that what is due\r\nto infection has been set down as a symptom of old age.[22]\r\n\r\nAlthough the appearance of patients from whom the thyroid gland has\r\nbeen removed, or in whom it has degenerated spontaneously, recalls\r\nthat of old people, it is possible to exaggerate the similarity. In\r\nthe masterly accounts of such unfortunates, recently compiled by\r\nthe well-known surgeon Kocher[23] there are many points which are\r\ncharacteristic, without being typical, of old people.\r\n\r\nOedema of the skin which characterises thyroid patients is by no\r\nmeans usual in old age. The loss of hair, normal in the patients, is\r\nnot a character of old age. In myxedematous women, menstruation is\r\nvery active; it ceases in old women. The great muscular development of\r\nmyxedematous patients distinguishes them from old people.\r\n\r\nPhysiological investigation does not support the existence of any\r\nstrong affinity between old age and affection of the thyroid gland. It\r\nis known that removal of the thyroid is followed by cachexia only in\r\nyoung subjects, MM. Bourneville and Bricon[24] having shown that the\r\ntendency to cachexia after extirpation of the thyroid ceases almost\r\nabruptly at the age of thirty. That age may be taken as the limit of\r\nyouth, of the time when growth is vigorous and the function of the\r\nthyroid most active. Cases of cachexia, where the thyroid gland has\r\nbeen removed in old persons from fifty to seventy, are very rare.\r\n\r\nRodents (rats, rabbits) support the removal of the thyroid extremely\r\nwell, without signs of cachexia, although these are normally\r\nshort-lived creatures. According to Horsley[25] extirpation of the\r\nthyroid is not followed by cachexia in birds or rodents and is followed\r\nby it only very slowly in ruminants and horses; it produces the\r\ncondition invariably but slightly in man and monkeys and extremely\r\nseriously in carnivora. If this series be compared with the information\r\ngiven in the next section of this volume on the relative ages which\r\nthe animals in question attain, it will be seen that there is no\r\ncorrespondence.\r\n\r\nIn short, whilst I do not deny that the vascular glands may take a\r\nshare in the causation of senility, in so far as they are destroyers\r\nof poisons, I cannot agree with the theory of Dr. Lorand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Testis tissue from a dog aged twenty-two years.\r\n\r\n(From a preparation made by Dr. Weinberg.)]\r\n\r\nI think it indubitable that in senescence the most active factor is\r\nsome alteration in the higher cells of the body, accompanied by a\r\ndestruction of these by macrophags which gradually usurp the places of\r\nthe higher elements and replace them by fibrous tissue. Such a process\r\naffects the organs of secretion (kidneys), the reproductive organs, and\r\nin a modified form the skin, the mucous membranes, and the skeleton.\r\nThe testes are amongst the organs which resist invasion by macrophags.\r\nI have already given an example (“The Nature of Man,” p. 98) of an old\r\nman of 94 in whom active spermatozoa were produced. I know of a similar\r\ncase, the age being 103 years. Such cases are not rare, and not only\r\nin old men, but in old animals, the testes continue to be active. Dr.\r\nWeinberg and I have investigated these organs in a dog which died at\r\nthe age of 22 years after several years of pronounced senility. Many of\r\nthe organs of the animal exhibited serious invasions by macrophags but\r\nthe testes were extremely active, the cells being in free proliferation\r\nand producing abundant spermatozoa (Fig. 11). In harmony with this\r\ncondition of the sexual organs, the sexual instincts of the animal\r\nremained normal. We have investigated another dog which died at the age\r\nof eighteen years. In this case the testes were cancerous and there was\r\nno possibility of the production of spermatozoa. None the less, this\r\ndog although markedly senile (Fig. 12) still showed sexual instincts\r\nuntil shortly before it died.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—An old dog, aged eighteen years.]\r\n\r\nIt is manifest that the tissues do not invariably degenerate in\r\nold age, nor do all the organs that are modified in old age show\r\ndestruction by phagocytes and replacement by connective tissue. Organs\r\nwhich produce phagocytes, such as the spleen, the spinal marrow and\r\nthe lymphatic glands, certainly show traces in old age of fibrous\r\ndegeneration but remain sufficiently active to produce macrophags which\r\ndestroy the higher cellular elements of the body. I have frequently\r\nnoticed cell division in such organs, and as an example may give the\r\ncase of the bone marrow taken from a man of 81 years (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nThe eye is an organ that is modified in old age without the action of\r\nmacrophags. Cataract and the senile arc which appears as a milky ring\r\nat the edge of the cornea are frequent in old age. These modifications\r\nare due to impregnation of the parts affected by fatty matter which\r\nmakes them opaque. This deposition of fat[26] has been attributed to\r\ndefective nutrition. In most organs such fatty degeneration is followed\r\nby phagocytosis, but the cornea and the crystalline lens are exempt\r\nfrom this consequence for anatomical reasons. Most organs possess in\r\naddition to their higher elements a constant source of macrophags.\r\nSuch a source of phagocytosis is the neuroglœa in nervous tissues,\r\nthe sarcoplasm in muscular tissues; the bones contain osteoclasts and\r\nthe liver and the kidneys are readily invaded by phagocytes from the\r\nblood. The lens and the cornea have no cells that are able to become\r\nmacrophags.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.—Bone marrow from the sternum of a man aged\r\n  eighty-one years.\r\n\r\n(From a preparation made by Dr. Weinberg.)]\r\n\r\nSome infectious diseases bring about precocious senility. A syphilitic\r\nchild is “a miniature old man, with wrinkled face, skin dull and\r\ndiscoloured and flabby and hanging in folds as if it were too\r\nlarge.”[27] In such a case the active agent is the microbe of syphilis\r\nwhich has poisoned the child on the breast of its mother. It is no\r\nmere analogy to suppose that human senescence is the result of a slow\r\nbut chronic poisoning of the organism. Such poisons, if not completely\r\ndestroyed or eliminated, weaken the tissues, the functions of which\r\nbecome altered or enfeebled, so that, amongst other changes, there\r\nis deposition of fatty matter. The phagocytes resist the influence of\r\ninvading poisons better than any of the other cells of the body and\r\nsometimes are stimulated by them. The general result of such conditions\r\nis that there comes to be a struggle between the higher cells and the\r\nphagocytes in which the latter have the advantage.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the question as to whether our senescence can be\r\nameliorated must be approached from several points of view. This course\r\nI shall now follow.\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF LONGEVITY\r\n\r\n  Relation between longevity and size—Longevity and the\r\n  period of growth—Longevity and the doubling in weight\r\n  after birth—Longevity and rate of reproduction—Probable\r\n  relation between longevity and the nature of the food\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duration of the life of animals varies within very wide limits.\r\nSome, as for instance, the males of certain wheel animalculæ (Rotifera)\r\ncomplete their cycle of life from birth to death in 50 or 60 hours,\r\nwhilst others, like some reptiles, live more than 100 years, and quite\r\npossibly may live for two or three centuries.\r\n\r\nEnquiry has been made for many years as to whether there are laws\r\ngoverning these different durations of life. Even the most casual\r\nobservation of domesticated animals has shown that, as a general rule,\r\nsmall animals do not live so long as large ones; mice, guinea pigs, and\r\nrabbits for instance, have shorter lives than geese, ducks, and sheep,\r\nwhilst these again are survived by horses, deer, and camels. Of all the\r\nmammals which have lived under the protection of man, the elephant is\r\nat once the largest, and the most long-lived.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is not difficult to show that there is no absolute relation\r\nbetween size and longevity, since parrots, ravens, and geese live much\r\nlonger than many mammals, and than some much larger birds.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule it may be said that a large animal takes more time\r\nthan a small one to reach maturity, and it has been inferred from this\r\nthat the length of the periods of gestation and of growth were in\r\nproportion to the longevity. Buffon[28] long ago stated his opinion\r\nthat the “total duration of life bore some definite relation to the\r\nlength of the period of growth.” Therefore, as the period of growth is,\r\nso to say, inherent in the species, longevity would have to be regarded\r\nas a very stable phenomenon. Just as any species has acquired a fixed\r\nand practically invariable size, so it would have acquired a definite\r\nlongevity. Buffon, therefore, thought that the duration of life did\r\nnot depend on habits or mode of life, or on the nature of food, that,\r\nin fact, nothing could change its rigid laws, except an excess of\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nTaking as his standard the total period of development of the body,\r\nBuffon came to the conclusion that the duration of life is six or seven\r\ntimes that of the period of growth. Man, for instance, he said, who\r\ntakes 14 years to grow, can live 6 or 7 times that period, that is\r\nto say, 90 or 100 years. The horse, which reaches its full size in 4\r\nyears, can live 6 or 7 times that length of time, that is to say from\r\n25 to 30 years. The stag takes 5 or 6 years to grow, and reckoned in\r\nthe same way, its longevity should be 35 to 40 years.\r\n\r\nFlourens[29] although supporting his principle, thought that Buffon\r\nhad been inexact in calculating the period of growth. In his opinion\r\na better result can be obtained by taking the limit of growth as that\r\nage at which the epiphyses of the long bones unite with the bones\r\nthemselves. Using such a mode of computation, Flourens laid down that\r\nan animal lived 5 times the length of its period of growth. Man, for\r\ninstance, takes 20 years to grow, and he can live for 5 times that\r\nspace, that is to say, 100 years; the camel takes 8 to grow, and lives\r\n5 times as long, _i.e._, 40 years; the horse, 5 to grow, and lives 25\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHowever, even if we consider only the mammalia, it is impossible to\r\naccept Flourens’ law, without considerable reserve. Weismann[30] has\r\nreferred to the case of the horse, which is completely adult at 4, but\r\nlives not merely 5 times that period, but 10 or even 12 times. Mice\r\ngrow extremely quickly, so that they are able to reproduce at the age\r\nof 4 months. Even if we take 6 months as their period of growth, their\r\nlongevity of 5 years is twice as long as it would be according to the\r\nrule of Flourens. Amongst domesticated animals, the sheep is slow in\r\nreaching maturity; it does not acquire its adult set of teeth until it\r\nis 5 years old, and cannot be regarded as adult until then. None the\r\nless, at the age of 8 or 10 years, it loses its teeth and begins to\r\ngrow old, whilst by 14 it is quite senile.[31] The longevity of the\r\nsheep, therefore, is not quite three times its period of growth.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to other vertebrates, the variations in the relation of\r\ngrowth and the duration of life are still greater. Parrots, for\r\ninstance, the longevity of which is extremely great, grow very quickly.\r\nAt the age of 2 years, they have acquired the adult plumage and are\r\nable to reproduce, whilst the smaller species are in the same condition\r\nat the age of one. Incubation, moreover, is very short, not more than\r\n25 days, and in some species not three weeks. None the less, parrots\r\nare birds which enjoy a quite remarkable longevity. The incubation\r\nperiod of domestic geese is 30 days, and their period of growth is\r\nalso short. However, they may reach a great age, cases of 80 years and\r\nof 100 years being on record. In contrast with these, ostriches, the\r\nincubation period of which is 42 to 49 days, and which take 3 years to\r\nbecome adult, have a relatively short life.\r\n\r\nH. Milne-Edwards[32] many years ago contended that there was no\r\nimportance in the supposed law of relation between gestation and\r\nlongevity. He sums up his criticism as follows: “Although the period of\r\nuterine life is longer in the horse, that animal does not live so long\r\nas a human being; and some birds, the incubation of which only lasts a\r\nfew weeks, can live more than a century.”\r\n\r\nBunge[33] has recently taken up the study of the relations between the\r\nduration of growth and longevity, and has suggested a new means of\r\ninvestigation. He has observed that the period in which the new-born\r\nmammal doubles its weight is a good index of the rapidity of its\r\ngrowth. He has shown that whilst a human child requires 180 days to\r\nreach double its weight at birth, the horse, the longevity of which is\r\nvery much less, doubles its weight in 60 days; a calf takes only 47\r\ndays for this; a kid 15 days; a pig 14 days; a cat 9-1/2; and a dog\r\nonly 9 days. Although these facts are very interesting, the exceptions\r\nare too great to make it possible to base a law of longevity upon them.\r\nThe period of weight-doubling in the horse is nearly 7 times longer\r\nthan that in the dog, and yet the longevity of the horse is not more\r\nthan 3 times that of the dog. The goat, which takes much longer than\r\nthe dog to double its weight, has a shorter total life.\r\n\r\nI observed myself that new-born mice quadruple their weight in the\r\nfirst 24 hours. The doubling of weight in their case requires a time\r\n36 times less long than that of the cat, and yet the cat lives only 5\r\ntimes as long as the mouse.\r\n\r\nIt is fair to say, however, that Bunge himself does not draw a definite\r\nconclusion from these figures and has published them only to stimulate\r\ninterest in the subject. He is against the view of Flourens, and points\r\nout that although the multiple 5 is valid for man, it is not so in the\r\ncase of the horse which finishes its growth in 4 years and yet reaches\r\nthe age of 40 much less often than human beings attain that of 100\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is impossible to admit the existence of exact relations\r\nbetween size and the period of growth on the one side, and longevity\r\non the other, in the mode which Buffon and Flourens have followed,\r\nit is none the less true that there is something intrinsic in each\r\nkind of animal which sets a definite limit to the length of years it\r\ncan attain. The purely physiological conditions which determine this\r\nlimit leave room for a considerable amount of variation in longevity.\r\nDuration of life therefore, is a character which can be influenced by\r\nthe environment. Weismann in his well-known essay on the duration of\r\nlife, has laid stress on this side of the problem. Longevity, according\r\nto him, although in the last resort depending on the physiological\r\nproperties of the cells of which the organism is composed, can be\r\nadapted to the conditions of existence and influenced by natural\r\nselection, like other characters useful for the existence of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIf a species is to remain in existence, its members must be able to\r\nreproduce and the progeny must be able to reach adult life so that\r\nthey in their turn may reproduce. Now, it happens that there are some\r\nanimals the fecundity of which is extremely limited. Most birds which\r\nare adapted to aerial life, and the weight of which is therefore to\r\nbe kept down, lay very few eggs. This happens in the case of birds\r\nof prey, such as eagles and vultures. These birds nest only once a\r\nyear, and generally rear two or frequently only a single nestling.\r\nIn such circumstances the duration of life becomes a factor in the\r\npreservation of the species, more important since eggs and chicks are\r\nsubject to many dangers. Eggs are devoured by many kinds of animals,\r\nwhilst unseasonable cold may kill the chicks. If the members of such\r\na species were incapable of living long, the unfavourable conditions\r\nof life would soon lead to extinction. Those animals which reproduce\r\nrapidly generally have a relatively brief duration of life. Mice, rats,\r\nrabbits, and many other rodents seldom live more than 5 or 10 years,\r\nbut reproduce with enormous rapidity. It is almost possible to imagine\r\nthat there is some sort of intimate link, possibly physiological,\r\nbetween longevity and low fertility. It is a current opinion that\r\nreproduction wastes the maternal organism and that mothers of many\r\nchildren grow old prematurely and seldom reach an advanced age.\r\nThis would seem to mean that fecundity was the cause of the short\r\nduration of life. However, we must guard ourselves against such a\r\ntheory. Longevity, at least in the case of vertebrate animals, differs\r\nextremely little in the two sexes, although the cost of the new\r\ngeneration to the adult organism is very much greater in the case of\r\nthe female than of the male parent. None the less, females frequently\r\nreach a great age, especially in the human race where women reach 100\r\nyears, or live beyond that time, much more often than men.\r\n\r\nLow fertility, however, cannot itself be regarded as a cause of\r\nlongevity, as there are some very fertile animals which none the less\r\nattain great ages. There are parrots which lay two or three times a\r\nyear, producing six to nine eggs in each clutch. The ducks (Anatidæ)\r\nare distinguished for considerable longevity and very high fertility,\r\neach nest containing rarely less than six and sometimes as many as\r\nsixteen eggs. The common Sheldrake lays from twenty to thirty eggs.\r\nTame ducks, in some parts of the tropics, lay an egg daily throughout\r\nthe season. Wild ducks lay from seven to fourteen eggs in one nest.\r\nDucks and geese, none the less, frequently attain considerable ages,\r\nducks having been known to live for 29 years. Even the common fowl,\r\nwhich is a notoriously prolific bird, may reach an age of twenty to\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\nIt will be said, however, that these birds are exposed to many enemies\r\nduring youth. Chickens, ducklings, and goslings are ready prey for\r\nhawks, foxes and small carnivora. The longevity is possibly to be\r\nexplained as an adaptation for the preservation of the species by\r\ncompensating for the great destruction of the young. Weismann explains\r\nin this way the longevity of many aquatic birds and other creatures\r\nthat are much preyed on. It must be noted, however, that the longevity\r\ncannot depend on the risks run by the young birds, but must have arisen\r\nindependently. If this had not occurred, creatures, the young of which\r\nare destroyed in great numbers, would have ceased to exist, as many\r\nspecies have disappeared in geological time. The longevity of prolific\r\nanimals, the young of which are destroyed in numbers, must be due to\r\nsome cause which is neither fertility nor the destruction of their\r\noffspring. This cause must be sought in the physiological processes of\r\nthe organism and can be attributed neither to the length of the period\r\nof growth nor to the size attained by the adults.\r\n\r\nAfter having discussed various theories of the cause of the duration of\r\nlife, M. Oustalet,[34] in a most interesting essay on the longevity of\r\nvertebrates, came to the conclusion that diet was the chief factor. He\r\nthinks that there is a “definite relation between diet and longevity.\r\nFor the most part herbivorous animals live longer than carnivorous\r\nforms, probably because the former find their food with ease and\r\nregularity, whilst the latter alternate between semi-starvation and\r\nrepletion.” There are certainly many instances which give support to\r\nthe view. Elephants and parrots, for instance, are vegetarian and reach\r\nvery great ages. On the other hand, there exist long-living carnivorous\r\nanimals. Many observations have made it certain that owls and eagles\r\nreach great ages, and these birds live on animal food. Ravens, which\r\nlive on carrion, are also notorious for the duration of their lives.\r\nThere is no exact knowledge as to the ages reached by crocodiles, but\r\nalthough these live on flesh, it is certain that their longevity is\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nWe must seek elsewhere for the real factors that control duration of\r\nlife. Before stating my conclusion, I will review what is known as to\r\nthe duration of life of different animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM\r\n\r\n  Longevity in the lower animals—Instances of long life\r\n  in sea-anemones and other invertebrates—Duration of\r\n  life of insects—Duration of life of “cold-blooded”\r\n  vertebrates—Duration of life of birds—Duration of life\r\n  of mammals—Inequality of the duration of life in males\r\n  and females—Relations between longevity and fertility of\r\n  the organism\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful to what an extent the duration of life varies amongst\r\nanimals, the slightest examination of the facts showing that very many\r\nfactors must be involved.\r\n\r\nAs the higher animals are nearly always larger than invertebrates, if\r\nthere be a definite relation between longevity and size, one would\r\nexpect to find that vertebrates live longer than invertebrates.\r\nHowever, this is not the case. Amongst animals of extremely simple\r\norganisation, there are some which reach a great age. A striking\r\nexample of this is found in sea-anemones. These animals have a very\r\nsimple structure, without a separate digestive canal, and with a\r\nbadly developed, diffused nervous system, and yet have lived very\r\nlong in captivity. More than forty years ago, I remember having\r\nseen in the possession of M. Lloyd, the Director of the Aquarium at\r\nHamburg, an anemone that he had kept alive for several dozen years in\r\na glass bowl. Another sea-anemone, belonging to the species _Actinia\r\nmesembryanthemum_, is known to have lived 66 years. It was captured in\r\n1828 by Dalyell, a Scottish zoologist, and was then quite adult, and\r\nprobably about 7 years old. It survived its owner for 36 years, and\r\ndied in Edinburgh in 1887, the cause of death being unknown. Although\r\nthey are thus capable of living so long, the rate of growth of members\r\nof this species is rapid, and their fertility is very high. According\r\nto Dalyell, these anemones reach the adult condition in 15 months. The\r\nspecimen in his possession, in the 20 years from 1828 to 1848 produced\r\n334 larvæ, then after a period of sterility it gave birth, in one night\r\n(1857) to 230 young anemones. This extraordinary prolificness decreased\r\nwith age, but even when it was 58 years old it used to produce from 5\r\nto 20 at a time. In the seven years from 1872 onwards, it gave birth to\r\n150 young anemones.[35] This animal, which certainly was not more than\r\nthe fortieth or the fiftieth of the weight of an adult rabbit, lived\r\nsix or seven times as long.\r\n\r\nAshworth and Nelson Annandale have published their observations on\r\nanother sea-anemone, of the species _Sagartia troglodytes_, which was\r\n50 years old. It differed from younger examples only in being less\r\nprolific.\r\n\r\nThere are other polyps, such as _Flabellum_, which do not live more\r\nthan 24 years, although we have no knowledge as to the cause of the\r\ndifferent duration of life.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the length of the life of molluscs and insects is\r\nextremely great. Some species of gasteropods (_Vitrina_, _Succinea_)\r\nlive only a very few years, whilst others (_Natica heros_) can reach\r\nthirty years. Some of the marine bivalves, as for instance, _Tridacna\r\ngigas_, can live to sixty or a hundred years.[36]\r\n\r\nInsects are animals as variable in their duration of life as they are\r\nin other respects. Some live only a few weeks; some of the plant-lice,\r\nfor instance, die in a month. In the same order of Insects, however,\r\n(Hemiptera) there are species of cicada which live thirteen to\r\nseventeen years, that is to say, much longer than such little Rodents\r\nas rats, mice, and guinea-pigs. The larva of an American species spends\r\nseventeen years buried in the ground in orchards, where it feeds on the\r\nroots of apple trees, and the species is known as _Cicada septemdecim_,\r\nbecause of this duration of life. In the adult stage the insect lives\r\nlittle more than a month, just time enough to lay the eggs, and bring\r\ninto the world the new generation, which in its turn will not appear\r\nabove ground until after another period of seventeen years.\r\n\r\nBetween these extremes of long and short life, there is to be found\r\namongst insects almost every gradation of longevity. Science, in its\r\npresent state, has failed to find any law governing these facts. Rules\r\nwhich hold good up to a certain point in the case of the higher animals\r\nbreak down in their application to insects. The large grasshoppers\r\nand locusts, for instance, live a much shorter time than many minute\r\nbeetles. Queen bees, the fertility of which is very great, live two\r\nor three years and may reach a fifth year, whilst worker bees, which\r\nare infertile, die in the first year of their existence. Female ants,\r\nalthough these are small and extremely prolific, reach the age of seven\r\nyears.[37]\r\n\r\nWe know so little about the physiological processes of insects, that we\r\ncannot as yet make even a guess at the cause of this great variation\r\nin their longevity. It is more probable that we shall find some\r\nexplanation in the case of vertebrates concerning which we know much\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the facts shows that whilst in the evolution from fish to\r\nmammal there has been a great increase in complexity of organisation,\r\nthere has at the same time been a reduction in the duration of life.\r\nAs a general rule, it may be laid down that the lower vertebrates live\r\nlonger than mammals.\r\n\r\nThe facts about the longevity of fish are not very numerous, but it\r\nseems clear that these animals reach a great age. The ancient Romans,\r\nwho used to keep eels in aquaria, have noted that these fish would\r\nlive for more than sixty years. There is reason to believe that salmon\r\ncan live for a century, whilst pike live much longer. There is, for\r\ninstance, the much quoted instance of the pike stated by Gessner to\r\nhave been captured in 1230 and to have lived for 267 years afterwards.\r\nCarps are regarded as equally long lived, Buffon setting down their\r\nperiod of life as 150 years. There is a popular idea that the carp in\r\nthe lakes at Fontainebleau and Chantilly are several centuries old, but\r\nE. Blanchard throws doubt on the accuracy of this estimate, inasmuch\r\nas during revolutionary times most of the carp were eaten when the\r\npalaces were overrun by the populace. There is no doubt, however, that\r\nthe life of carp may be very long indeed. Not very much is known about\r\nthe duration of life in batrachians, but it is certain at least that\r\nsome small frogs may live twelve or sixteen years, and toads as many as\r\nthirty-six years.\r\n\r\nMore is known about the life of reptiles. Crocodiles and caymans,\r\nwhich are large and which grow very slowly, attain great ages. In the\r\nParis Museum of Natural History there are crocodiles which have been\r\nkept for more than forty years without showing signs of senescence.\r\nTurtles, although they are smaller than crocodiles, live still longer.\r\nA tortoise has lived for eighty years in the garden of the Governor\r\nof Cape Town, and is believed to have reached the age of two hundred\r\nyears. Another tortoise, a native of the Galapagos Islands, is known to\r\nbe 175 years old, whilst a specimen in the London Zoological Gardens is\r\n150 years old. A land tortoise (_Testudo marginata_) has been kept in\r\nNorfolk, England, for a century. I am informed that in the Archbishop’s\r\npalace at Canterbury, there is to be seen the carapace of a tortoise\r\nwhich was brought to the Palace in 1623 and which lived there for\r\n107 years.[38] Another tortoise, brought to Fulham by Archbishop\r\nLaud, lived in the Palace for 128 years. I have already referred to a\r\nspecimen of _Testudo mauritanica_, the history of which is known for 86\r\nyears, but which is probably much older.\r\n\r\nVery little is known as to the longevity of lizards and serpents, but\r\nit may be inferred from what I have said about other reptiles that\r\nreptiles as a class are able to reach great ages.\r\n\r\nIt is an easy inference that the great duration of life in cold-blooded\r\nanimals is associated with the slowness of the physiological processes\r\nin these creatures. The circulation, for instance, is so slow, that the\r\nheart of a tortoise beats only 20 to 25 times in a minute. Weismann has\r\nsuggested that one of the factors influencing the duration of life is\r\nthe rapidity or slowness of the vital activities, the times taken by\r\nthe processes of absorption and nutrition.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the blood is hot and the vital activities are rapid\r\nin birds, and yet birds may attain great ages. Although in the last\r\nchapter I gave a number of examples, the subject is so important that I\r\npropose to go further into details. The possibility of this is due to\r\nan admirable set of details brought together by Mr. J. H. Gurney.[39]\r\nIn his list, in which are included more than fifty species of birds, the\r\nlowest figures are from eight and a half to nine years (_Podargus\r\ncuvieri_, _Chelidon urbica_), and a duration of life so short is an\r\nexception, a period of from fifteen to twenty years being more common.\r\nCanaries have lived in captivity from 17 to 20 years, and goldfinches\r\nup to 23 years. Field larks have lived for 24 years, the Lesser\r\nBlack-backed Gull 31 years and the Herring Gull 44 years. Birds of\r\nmedium size may live for several dozens of years, whether they live\r\non animal or on vegetable food, whether they are prolific or lay very\r\nfew eggs. I will quote only a few instances. Of forty parrots the\r\nminimum and maximum ages were respectively 15 and 81 years, and the\r\naverage 43 years. Without accepting the truth of the story mentioned by\r\nHumboldt according to which certain parrots survived an extinct race\r\nof Indians, at least we may be certain that great ages have sometimes\r\nbeen reached by these birds. Levaillant mentions a parrot (_Psittacus\r\nerithaceus_) which lost its memory at the age of 60 years, its sight at\r\n90 years, and which died aged 93 years. Another individual, probably\r\nof the same species, is reported by J. Jennings to have reached the\r\nage of 77. Jones, Layard, and Butler are the authorities for instances\r\nof Sulphur-crested Cockatoos having reached respectively 30, 72 and\r\n81 years. M. Abrahams states that an Amazon (_Chrysotis amasonica_)\r\nlived 102 years. I myself have observed two cases of great longevity\r\nin the same species of parrot. One of these birds died at the age of\r\n82 years, apparently simply from old age, whilst the other, which was\r\nin my possession for several years before it died at the age of 70\r\nto 75 years, was vigorous, showing no signs of senility, but died of\r\npneumonia.\r\n\r\nMr. Gurney found that parrots were not the only birds capable of\r\nreaching a great age. One raven reached 69 years and another 50, an\r\nEagle-owl (_Bubo maximus_) 68 years, another 53, a condor 52, an\r\nimperial eagle 56, a common heron 60, a wild goose 80, and a common\r\nswan 70 years. None of these examples approaches the legendary\r\nthree centuries attributed to the swan, but it is evident that many\r\ndifferent kinds of birds may attain great age. I can add some cases\r\nto those of Mr. Gurney. In the Royal Park at Schönbrunn, near Vienna,\r\na white-headed vulture (_Neophron percnopterus_) died aged 118 years,\r\na golden eagle (_Aquila chrysaëtus_) aged 104, and another aged 80\r\n(according to Oustalet). Mr. Pycraft (_Country Life_, June 25th, 1904)\r\nreported that a female eagle, captured in Norway in 1829, had been\r\nbrought to England and had lived for 75 years. In the last thirty years\r\nof its life, it had produced ninety eggs. The same writer mentions the\r\ncase of a falcon having lived to 162 years.\r\n\r\nThe collection of facts that I have passed in review make it manifest\r\nthat birds may have a great duration of life, but that reptiles surpass\r\nthem in this respect. Birds certainly do not reach the very great ages\r\nof crocodiles and tortoises.\r\n\r\nLongevity, therefore, is reduced as we ascend in the scale of\r\nvertebrate life. We find a still greater reduction when we turn from\r\nbirds to mammals. Some mammals, it is true, may live as long as birds.\r\nElephants are a good instance. It used to be thought that these\r\ngiant mammals could live three or four centuries, but I can find no\r\nconfirmation of the legend, which seems as mythical as that relating to\r\nthe life of swans. There are no exact data as to the ages reached by\r\nwild elephants, but it has been stated that in captivity an elephant\r\nrarely but occasionally has completed its century. In zoological\r\ngardens and in good menageries, where elephants are well cared for,\r\nthey seldom live more than 20 to 25 years. Chevrette, an African\r\nelephant presented to the Jardin des Plantes by Mehemet Ali, in 1825,\r\nlived for only 30 years. In the official list of the Indian Government,\r\nwhich gives the deaths of elephants, it appears that of 138 examples,\r\nonly one lived more than 20 years after it had been purchased (Brehm’s\r\n_Mammals_).\r\n\r\nFlourens, using his own formula, assigned the age of 150 years to\r\nelephants as their epiphyses do not fuse with the long bones until\r\nthe age of 30. So far, I know of no fact to support the conclusion,\r\nalthough it seems fairly well established that occasionally an elephant\r\nmay reach a century. It is stated that one elephant was in service\r\nthroughout the whole period of more than 140 years in which Ceylon was\r\noccupied by the Dutch. This elephant was found in the stables in 1656.\r\nNatives with special knowledge of elephants set down their duration of\r\nlife as from 80 to 150 years, but say that they begin to grow old at\r\nfrom 50 to 60 years of age. My general conclusion from the facts is\r\nthat the life of these very large mammals is about the same as that of\r\nman who is very much smaller.\r\n\r\nCentenarians, extremely rare amongst elephants, do not appear to exist\r\nin any other kind of mammals except man. The rhinoceros, another large\r\nmammal which is a native of the same countries as the elephant, does\r\nnot reach a great age. According to Oustalet an Indian rhinoceros died\r\nin the menagerie of the Paris Museum at about the age of 25 years,\r\nand showed all the signs of senility. Another Indian rhinoceros lived\r\nfor 37 years in the London Zoological Gardens. Grindon has stated his\r\nopinion that the rhinoceros may live for 70 or 80 years, but this\r\nseems rather an inference from the slowness of growth than a statement\r\nof observed fact.\r\n\r\nHorses and cattle are large animals, but do not enjoy very long lives.\r\nThe usual duration of life in horses is from 15 to 30 years. They begin\r\nto grow old about 10 years, and in very rare cases may reach 40 or\r\nmore. A Welsh pony is said to have reached the age of sixty, but such a\r\ncase is excessively rare. Two other extreme cases are that of a horse\r\nbelonging to the Bishop of Metz which died at the age of 50 years, and\r\nthe charger of Field-Marshal Lacy which died at 46.\r\n\r\nThe duration of life of cattle is still shorter. Domestic cattle show\r\nthe first sign of age, a yellow discoloration of the teeth, when five\r\nyears old. In the sixteenth to eighteenth year the teeth fall out,\r\nor break, and the cow ceases to give milk, whilst the bull has lost\r\nreproductive power. According to Brehm, cattle live for 25 to 30\r\nyears or more. Although the duration of life is short, cattle are not\r\nprolific. The gestation period of a cow approaches that of the human\r\nrace (242-287 days), and there is only one birth a year. The total\r\nperiod of reproductivity lasts only a few years.\r\n\r\nThe sheep, another domesticated Ruminant, has a life even shorter.\r\nAccording to Grindon, sheep do not live longer than 12 years as a rule,\r\nbut may reach 14 years, which in their case would be extreme age, as\r\nthey generally lose their teeth at from 8 to 10 years.\r\n\r\nSome Ruminants, such as camels and deer, apparently live longer than\r\nsheep or cattle, but I do not know exact facts about them.\r\n\r\nThe short life of domesticated carnivorous animals is well known. Dogs\r\nseldom live more than 16 or 18 years, and even before that, at an age\r\nof from 10 to 12, they usually show plain signs of senility. Jonatt\r\nhas mentioned as an extreme rarity a dog of 22 years of age, and Sir E.\r\nRay Lankester (_Comparative Longevity_, p. 60) cites another instance,\r\nin this case the age being 34 years. The oldest dog that I have been\r\nable to procure died at the age of 22.\r\n\r\nIt is generally believed that cats do not live so long as dogs. The\r\naverage age which they may attain is usually thought to be 10 or 12\r\nyears, but certainly a cat of that age has not the decrepid appearance\r\nof an old dog. Thanks to the kindness of M. Barrier, the Director of\r\nthe Ecole d’Alfort, I have had in my possession a cat 23 years old. It\r\nappeared to be quite vigorous, and died from cancer in the liver.\r\n\r\nMost rodents, particularly the domesticated kinds, are extremely\r\nprolific and very short lived. It is extremely rare for a rabbit to\r\nreach the age of 10 years, whilst 7 years is the utmost limit for a\r\nguinea-pig. Mice, so far as I can ascertain, do not live more than 5 or\r\n6 years.\r\n\r\nIt is plain from the facts that I have brought together, that mammals,\r\nwhether they are large or small, as a rule, have shorter lives than\r\nbirds. It is probable, therefore, that there is something in the\r\nstructure of mammals which has brought about a shortening in the\r\nduration of their lives.\r\n\r\nWhilst most of the lower vertebrates, and all birds, reproduce by\r\nlaying eggs, the vast majority of mammals are viviparous. As the tax\r\non the parent organism is greater when the young are produced alive\r\nthan when eggs are laid, it might be thought that in this difference\r\nlay the cause of the shorter life of mammals. It is well known that an\r\nanimal may be made feeble by too great fecundity, and it is conceivable\r\nthat the kind of parasitic life of the embryos within the body of the\r\nmother may weaken her system.\r\n\r\nThere are many facts, however, which make it impossible to accept such\r\na view. The longevity of mammals is nearly equal in the two sexes,\r\nalthough the tax on the organism caused by reproduction is much greater\r\nin the case of females than in males. Longevity, however, cannot\r\nbe regarded as a character stable in each species and necessarily\r\nidentical in the two sexes. The animal kingdom presents many cases of\r\ndisparity in this respect, the difference in longevity in the two sexes\r\nbeing specially striking in species of insects. Generally, the females\r\nlive longer than the males, as, for instance, amongst the Strepsiptera,\r\nwhere the females have 64 times the duration of life of the males. On\r\nthe other hand, amongst butterflies, there are cases (_e.g._, _Aglia\r\ntau_) where the males live longer than the females. In the human race,\r\nthere is a difference in the longevity of the sexes, the females having\r\nthe advantage.\r\n\r\nAs in most cases of disparity in the duration of life the female\r\nlives longer than the male, it is plain that the difference cannot be\r\nassigned to the drain on the organism caused by reproduction, which, of\r\ncourse, is much greater in females.\r\n\r\nMoreover, a closer scrutiny of the facts shows that although mammals\r\ndo not live so long as birds, the reproductive drain is greater in the\r\ncase of birds.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the productivity of an animal is not necessarily\r\nidentical with its fecundity. Fish or frogs which lay thousands of\r\neggs at a time (a pike, for example, produces 130,000) are obviously\r\nmore prolific than, for instance, a sparrow which lays only 18 eggs in\r\na year, or than a rabbit, which in the same time gives birth to from\r\n25 to 50. However, to produce this much smaller quantity of eggs or of\r\nyoung, the sparrow and the rabbit (I have chosen the most prolific bird\r\nand mammal) expend a much larger quantity of material than the frog or\r\nthe fish. The sparrow and the rabbit employ in producing their progeny\r\na bulk of material greater than the weight of their body, whilst the\r\nenormous quantity of eggs laid by the frog does not weigh more than\r\none-seventh part of the body of the frog. It may be laid down, as a\r\ngeneral rule, that although fecundity, that is to say the number of\r\neggs or of young which are produced, diminishes as the organism becomes\r\nmore complex, the productivity on the other hand increases, expressed\r\nin percentage of weight. The productivity, which is not more than 18\r\nper cent. in batrachia, reaches 50 per cent. in reptiles, 74 per cent.\r\nin mammals, and 82 per cent. in birds.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that if reproduction shortens the life of mammals by\r\nweakening the organism, it must be the productivity, not the fecundity,\r\nwhich is the important factor. I have just shown that productivity\r\nis greater in birds than in mammals, and in consequence it cannot be\r\non account of any greater burden of reproduction that mammals have a\r\nshorter life than birds. The shortness of mammalian life, again, cannot\r\nbe attributed to the fact that mammals give birth to young, whilst\r\nthe long-lived reptiles and birds produce eggs, because the longevity\r\nof the males, which produce neither young nor eggs, is none the less\r\npractically equal to that of the females of the same species. The\r\nreason of the short life of mammals must be sought for elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM AND SENILITY\r\n\r\n  Relations between longevity and the structure\r\n  of the digestive system—The Cæca in birds—The\r\n  large intestine of mammals—Function of the large\r\n  intestine—The intestinal microbes and their agency in\r\n  producing auto-intoxication and auto-infection in the\r\n  organism—Passage of microbes through the intestinal wall\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the duration of life in mammals is relatively shorter\r\nthan that in birds, and in the so-called “cold-blooded” vertebrates.\r\nNo indication as to the cause of this difference can be found in\r\nthe structure of the organs of circulation, respiration, or urinary\r\nsecretion, or in the nervous or sexual apparatus. The key to the\r\nproblem is to be found in the organs of digestion.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the anatomical structure of the digestive apparatus in the\r\nvertebrate series, one soon comes to the striking fact that mammals\r\nare the only group in which the large intestine is much developed. In\r\nfish, the large intestine is the least important part of the digestive\r\ntube, being little wider in calibre than the small intestine. Amongst\r\nbatrachia, where it is a relatively wide sack, it has begun to assume\r\nsome importance. In several reptiles it is still larger, and may be\r\nprovided with a lateral out-growth, which is to be regarded as a cæcum.\r\nIn birds, the large intestine still remains relatively badly developed;\r\nit is short and straight. In most birds, at the point where the large\r\nintestine passes into the small intestine, there is a pair of cæca,\r\nmore or less developed. These cæca are absent in climbing birds, such\r\nas the wood-pecker, the oriole, and many others. They are reduced to\r\na pair of tiny outgrowths in the eagles, sparrow-hawks, and other\r\ndiurnal birds of prey, and in pigeons, and perching birds. These organs\r\nare larger in the nocturnal birds of prey, in gallinaceous birds, and\r\nin ducks, etc.[40]\r\n\r\nIn the large running birds, such as ostriches, rheas, and tinamous,\r\nthe cæca are relatively largest. Thus, for instance, in a rhea (_Rhea\r\namericana_) which I dissected, the cæca were nearly two-thirds as long\r\nas the small intestine. The latter was 1·65 m. in length, whereas one\r\nof the cæca was 1·01 m., and the other 0·95 m. The weight of the two\r\ncæca with their contents was more than 10 per cent. of the total weight\r\nof the bird.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the exceptions, which are relatively rare, the large\r\nintestine is badly developed in the case of birds. On the other hand,\r\nit reaches its largest size amongst mammals. In these animals, “only\r\nthe posterior portion of the latter, or rectum, which passes into the\r\npelvic cavity, corresponds to the large intestine of lower Vertebrates;\r\nthe remaining, and far larger part, must be looked upon as a neomorph,\r\nand is called the colon.”[41]\r\n\r\nGegenbaur,[42] another well-known authority on comparative anatomy,\r\nwrites as follows on this subject:—“The hind-gut is longest in the\r\nMammalia, where it forms the large intestine, and is distinguished\r\nas such, from the mid-gut, or small intestine. Owing to its greater\r\nlength, it is arranged in coils, so that the terminal portion only has\r\nthe straight course taken by the hind-gut of other Vertebrata.”\r\n\r\nThe two series of facts are not to be disputed. On the one hand mammals\r\nare shorter lived than birds and lower vertebrates, on the other\r\nhand the large intestine is much longer in them than in any other\r\nvertebrates. Is there here any link of causality, binding the two\r\ncharacters, or is it a mere coincidence?\r\n\r\nTo answer the question we must turn to the function of the large\r\nintestine in vertebrates. In the lower members of the group (fish,\r\nbatrachia, reptiles, birds, etc.), the large intestine is not more\r\nthan a mere reservoir for the waste matter in the food. It takes no\r\nshare in digestion, as that is the function of the stomach and the\r\nsmall intestine. Only the cæcum can be thought to have some digestive\r\nproperty. In reptiles, the lowest vertebrates in which the cæcum is\r\npresent, it is so little differentiated from the large intestine\r\nitself, that it is difficult to assign to it any specialised function.\r\nIn very many birds, however, the cæca are well separated from the main\r\ndigestive tube. The food material passes into them in considerable\r\nquantities, and is retained there sufficiently long for some digestive\r\nprocess to take place. M. Maumus has found, in the cæca of birds,\r\nsecretions which can dissolve albumen and invert sugar cane, but he has\r\nbeen unable to make out that the cæcal juice has any action upon fatty\r\nmatter. Such digestive power, however, is slight, and when M. Maumus\r\nremoved the cæca in fowls and ducks, no evil consequences followed.\r\nAs in many birds the cæca are rudimentary and in others absent, it\r\nmay be inferred that these organs are useless, and are in process\r\nof degeneration in the class. The cæca can be regarded as playing\r\nan important part in the organism only in the case of large running\r\nbirds, where they are very highly developed, but we have not precise\r\ninformation as to their digestive function.\r\n\r\nThe variations in the structure in the large intestine are greater\r\nin mammals than in birds. In some mammals, the large intestine is a\r\nsimple prolongation of the small intestine, similar in calibre and\r\nin structure. In these conditions it may fulfil a definite digestive\r\nfunction. Th. Eimer[43] has determined that in insectivorous bats the\r\nlarge intestine digests insects like the small intestine. Such cases,\r\nhowever, are rare. In most mammals the large intestine is sharply\r\nseparated from the small intestine by a valve, and opens directly\r\ninto the cæcum which may be very large. In the horse, the cæcum is an\r\nenormous bag, cylindrical and tapering, generally well filled, and\r\nholding on an average 35 litres. It is equally large in many other\r\nherbivorous animals, such as the tapir, the elephant, and most rodents.\r\nIn such cases, the food remains for a considerable time in the organ\r\nand without doubt undergoes some digestive changes. In many other\r\nmammals, particularly carnivorous forms, the cæcum may be quite absent,\r\nwhilst in some, as for instance, the cat and dog, it is very small;\r\nin the latter cases its digestive function must be non-existent or\r\ninsignificant.[44]\r\n\r\nAs for the large intestine itself, apart from the special cases, such\r\nas bats, it cannot fulfil any notable digestive function. Th. Eimer was\r\nunable to find a proof of any such action in rats and mice, and the\r\nvery many investigations that have been made in the case of man seem to\r\nhave established the absence of digestive power in the colon.\r\n\r\nDr. Stragesco,[45] in a recent investigation carried out under the\r\ndirection of the famous Russian physiologist Pawloff, established that,\r\nin normal conditions, digestion and assimilation of food are confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the small intestine in mammals, and that the\r\nlarge intestine plays only the smallest part. It is only in certain\r\ndiseases of the digestive tract, in which, on account of increased\r\nperistaltic action, the contents of the intestine with the digestive\r\njuices are passed quickly from the small intestine to the large\r\nintestine, that some digestive work is done in the latter organ.\r\n\r\nThe large intestine (excluding the cæcum), then, cannot be regarded as\r\nan organ of digestion, although absorption of the liquids which have\r\nbeen formed in the small intestine, may take place within its walls. It\r\nis known that in the large intestine the contents of the gut give up\r\ntheir water and assume the solid form of fæcal matter. However, whilst\r\nthe mucous membrane of the large intestine rapidly absorbs water, it\r\nhas not a similar action on other substances.\r\n\r\nThe question of the extent to which the large intestine can absorb\r\nhas been closely investigated, because of its practical importance.\r\nIt sometimes happens that invalids cannot take food by the mouth, so\r\nthat their life would be in danger if it were not possible to supply\r\nthem with food otherwise. Attempts have been made to inject nutritive\r\nsubstances through the skin, or, and this is a more usual procedure, by\r\nthe rectum. By such means the organism can be kept alive for a certain\r\ntime, but the absorbing power of the large intestine is extremely\r\nsmall. According to Czerny and Lautschenberger[46] the entire colon\r\nof the human being can absorb no more than 6 grammes of albumen in 24\r\nhours, an amount which, from the point of view of nutrition, is very\r\nsmall. It was thought that the large intestine might more rapidly\r\nabsorb albuminous material which had been previously digested and\r\ntransformed to peptones, but the experiments of Ewald[47] showed that\r\neven in that case the absorption was very small. According to more\r\nrecent experiments of Heile,[48] carried out upon dogs which had cæcal\r\nfistulas, and in the case of a man who had an artificial aperture in\r\nthe colon, the large intestine does not absorb undigested white of\r\negg, and absorbs water, cane sugar, and glucose only very imperfectly.\r\nThe only substances which are rapidly absorbed through the wall of\r\nthe colon are the alkaline fluids from fæcal matter. It is possible,\r\nhowever, to nourish invalids by rectal injections of certain nutritious\r\nsubstances, the most important of which is milk.[49]\r\n\r\nThe large intestine, which has really very slight digestive properties\r\nand cannot absorb any considerable bulk of nutriment, is an organ which\r\nsecretes mucus. The latter serves to moisten the solid fæcal material,\r\nso aiding in its expulsion.\r\n\r\nWe must conclude, therefore, that the large intestine, the organ so\r\nhighly developed in mammals, is an apparatus the general function\r\nof which is the preparation and elimination of the waste products\r\nof digestion. Why should such an organ be so much more developed in\r\nmammals than in the other vertebrates?\r\n\r\nIn answer to the question, I have formed the theory that the large\r\nintestine has been increased in mammals to make it possible for\r\nthese animals to run long distances without having to stand still\r\nfor defæcation. The organ, then, would simply have the function of a\r\nreservoir of waste matter.\r\n\r\nBatrachia and reptiles lead a very idle life, and can move slowly,\r\nsometimes because they are protected by poison (toads, salamanders,\r\nserpents), sometimes because they have a very hard shell (turtles),\r\nsometimes because they are extremely powerful (crocodiles). Mammals, on\r\nthe other hand, have to move very actively to catch their prey, or to\r\nescape from their enemies. Such activity has become possible because\r\nof the high development of the limbs, and because the capacity of the\r\nlarge intestine makes possible the accumulation of waste matter for a\r\nconsiderable time.\r\n\r\nIn order to void the contents of the intestines, mammals have to stand\r\nstill and assume some particular position. Each act of this kind is\r\na definite risk in the struggle for existence. A carnivorous mammal\r\nwhich, in the process of hunting its prey, had to stop from time to\r\ntime, would be inferior to one which could pursue its course without\r\npausing. So, also, a herbivorous mammal, escaping from an enemy by\r\nflight, would have the better chance of surviving the less it was\r\nnecessary for it to stand still.\r\n\r\nAccording to such a view, the extreme development of the large\r\nintestine would supply a real want in the struggle for existence. M.\r\nYves Delage,[50] the well-known biologist, is unable to accept this\r\nhypothesis. He thinks that the rectal enlargement would fulfil the\r\npurpose, and adds that everyone has seen herbivorous animals pass their\r\nexcretions whilst running. The rectum of mammals, however, cannot\r\nserve as a reservoir for waste matter, because as soon as such matter\r\nreaches the rectum it excites the need of excretion. The waste matter\r\naccumulates in the large intestine, from which it passes into the\r\nrectum at intervals. When it has reached that region, a sensation is\r\ncaused which leads to defæcation.\r\n\r\nM. Delage is not quite definite when he speaks of mammals voiding their\r\nexcretions whilst they are in motion. A horse, harnessed to a vehicle,\r\nmay defæcate whilst it is walking or even running slowly. But these\r\nanimals cannot defæcate when in rapid motion, and competent observers\r\nstate that horses never do so whilst racing. In zoological gardens,\r\nwhere animals have room to run about, they stand still before emptying\r\nthe rectum. M. Ch. Debreuil, who keeps antelopes in a very large park\r\nat Melun, has noticed that the excreta are always to be found in masses\r\nand not scattered about as if they had been discharged by animals\r\nin motion. Antelopes, which are animals that run and leap extremely\r\nactively, have to come to a standstill before discharging their small\r\npellets of deer-like excreta.\r\n\r\nIn the struggle for existence, when a mammal is pursuing its prey or\r\nescaping its enemy, there is no question of the leisurely movement\r\nof a horse harnessed to an omnibus or cab, but the greatest possible\r\nactivity is necessary. In such circumstances the possession of an\r\norgan within which the excreta could accumulate would be of real\r\nimportance. My theory of the origin of the mammalian large intestine is\r\nintrinsically probable.\r\n\r\nAlthough the capacity of the large intestine may preserve a mammal in\r\nemergencies, it is attended with disadvantages that may shorten the\r\nactual duration of life.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of waste matter, retained in the large intestine\r\nfor considerable periods, becomes a nidus for microbes which produce\r\nfermentations and putrefaction harmful to the organism. Although our\r\nknowledge of the subject is far from complete, it is certain that the\r\nintestinal flora contains some microbes which damage health, either by\r\nmultiplying in the organism, or by poisoning it with their secretions.\r\nMost of our knowledge on this matter has come from the study of human\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nPersons have been known who do not defæcate except at intervals of\r\nseveral days, and who, none the less, do not seem to suffer in health.\r\nBut the opposite result is more common. The retention of fæcal matter\r\nfor several days very often brings harmful consequences. Organisms\r\nwhich are in a feeble state from some other cause are specially\r\nsusceptible to damage of the kind referred to. Infants are frequently\r\nseriously ill as the result of constipation. Dr. du Pasquier[51]\r\ndescribes such cases in the following words:—“The infant is leaden\r\nin hue, with sunken eyes, dilated pupils, and pinched nostrils. The\r\ntemperature may reach nearly 104° Fahr.; the pulse is rapid, feeble,\r\nand often irregular. Restlessness, insomnia, sometimes convulsions,\r\nstiffness of the neck and strabism show that the nervous system is\r\nbeing poisoned by toxins, and even collapse may be reached. The foul\r\nand dry tongue, the vomiting and fetid discharges show the disturbance\r\nof the digestive tract. Very often an eruption appears, as described\r\nby Hutinel, chiefly on the back and buttocks, the front of the thighs\r\nand fore-arms.” The illness may lead to death but is generally cured by\r\nsimple purging.\r\n\r\nWomen in pregnancy and child-birth frequently suffer much as the\r\nresult of retention of fæcal matter, and physicians are familiar\r\nwith the symptoms, which have been described as follows by M.\r\nBouchet[52]:—“After normal parturition, in the course of which the\r\nusual antiseptic precautions have been fully pursued, and where\r\ndelivery has been complete and natural, occasionally the patient is\r\nseized with chill and headache. The breath is fetid and the tongue\r\nfoul. The temperature, taken in the axilla, is nearly 101° Fahr. The\r\nabdomen is inflated and painful in the umbilical region. Palpation in\r\nthe iliac fossæ reveals lumps or consolidations along the colon. Thirst\r\nis intense, and there is complete anorexy. On questioning, it is found\r\nthat there has not been defæcation for several days. The treatment\r\nconsists of purgatives, enemas, and milk diet. In the next few days the\r\nbowels are emptied freely, the abdominal pain ceases, the temperature\r\nbecomes lower, appetite is restored, and the patient recovers.”\r\n\r\nThose who suffer from affections of the heart, liver, or kidneys are\r\nspecially susceptible to the evil results of retained fæcal matter. In\r\nsuch patients an error of diet or constipation may bring about most\r\nserious consequences.\r\n\r\nSuch facts are well known to physicians, and it has been established\r\nthat complete emptying of the lower bowels leads at once to favourable\r\nsymptoms. From the other side, it has been shown by experiment that\r\nartificial retention of the fæces by ligature of the rectum puts the\r\nbody in a grave condition.\r\n\r\nIf we collect our knowledge of all the facts, we cannot doubt but that\r\nthe cause of the evil is multiplication of microbes in the contents of\r\nthe large intestine. When the fæcal matter is free from microbes, as\r\nis the case with the meconium of the fœtus or new-born infant, it\r\nis not a source of danger to the organism. The waste of cells and the\r\nsecretions which are added to the undigested food cannot do any harm.\r\nAmongst the microbes of the gut, there are some that are inoffensive,\r\nbut others are known to have pernicious properties.\r\n\r\nThe ill-health which follows retention of fæcal matter is certainly\r\ndue to the action of some of the microbes of the gut. There are\r\ndifficulties, however, in determining the precise mode of action of\r\nthese microbes. It is generally believed that they form poisonous\r\nsubstances which are absorbed by the walls of the intestine and so pass\r\ninto the system. The phrase auto-intoxication as applied to infants,\r\nwomen in labour, and patients affected with diseases of the heart,\r\nliver, or kidneys, is based on this interpretation of the morbid\r\nprocesses involved. Attempts have been made to isolate and study the\r\npoisons in question, but there are many difficulties in the way. To\r\ndistinguish between the actions of the poisons and of the microbes\r\nthemselves, the latter have been destroyed by heat or by antiseptics,\r\nor been removed by filtration. Such methods, however, may alter the\r\npoisons and so are inconclusive. MM. Charron and Le Play[53] have\r\ntried to obtain exact results by heating the intestinal microbes to\r\na temperature of about 136° Fahr., a process which probably does not\r\nseriously deteriorate the microbial poisons. Such material, injected\r\ninto the veins of rabbits in large quantities, rapidly produced death,\r\nor in smaller quantities, proportionate ill-health.\r\n\r\nKukula[54] has tried to produce this toxic action in animals,\r\nemploying microbial secretions obtained from cases of intestinal\r\nobstruction. He succeeded in producing serious symptoms, such as\r\nvomiting and curvature of the neck and back, in fact, precisely the\r\nsequence of events familiar in cases of obstruction of the bowels or\r\nother retentions of fæcal matter.\r\n\r\nSome of the products of the intestinal flora are undoubtedly toxic,\r\nsuch as the benzol derivatives (phenol, etc.) ammonium and other\r\nsalts. Many of these toxins have been insufficiently studied, but it\r\nis well known that certain of them can be absorbed by the wall of the\r\ngut and act as poisons. A well known case is the toxin of botulism\r\nwhich was isolated and studied by M. van Ermenghem.[55] The poison,\r\nthe product of a microbe which causes serious intestinal disturbance,\r\nis so fatal that a single drop given to a rabbit produces death after\r\nsymptoms similar to those observed in cases of human beings poisoned by\r\nstale food. Butyric acid and the products of albuminous putrefaction\r\nare amongst the most pernicious of the microbial poisons produced\r\nin the large intestine. It is familiar that digestive disturbance\r\nis frequently associated with discharges of sulphuretted hydrogen\r\nand putrid excreta, and there is no doubt but that the microbes of\r\nputrefaction are the cause of these symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed for long that the retention of fæcal matter\r\ntends to putrefactive changes in the intestines, and that the evil\r\nconsequences of constipation are due to this. Recently, however,\r\nbacteriologists have criticised this accepted view, on account of the\r\nsmall number of microbes found in the excreta of constipated persons.\r\nStrasburger was the first to establish the fact, and his associate,\r\nSchmidt, showed that putrefaction did not follow when readily\r\nputrescible substances were infected with material taken from cases of\r\nconstipation. However, notwithstanding the exactness of these facts,\r\nI cannot accept the inference which has been drawn from them. The\r\nexcreta discharged naturally in cases of constipation do not give a\r\ncorrect indication of the conditions inside the gut; whilst such matter\r\ncontains few microbes, the substance removed after injection by an\r\nenema is extremely rich in bacteria. Moreover, analysis of the urine,\r\nin cases of constipation, shows an excess of the sulpho-conjugate\r\nethers which are known to be products of intestinal putrefaction.\r\n\r\nNot only is there auto-intoxication from the microbial poisons absorbed\r\nin cases of constipation, but microbes themselves may pass through the\r\nwalls of the intestine and enter the blood. In the maladies that are\r\nthe result of constipation some of the symptoms recall those of direct\r\ninfection, and it is highly probable that, if special investigations\r\nwere made, microbes of intestinal origin would be found in the blood of\r\nthe sick children and the pregnant or parturient women whose symptoms I\r\nhave described above.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the passage of microbes through the intestinal walls\r\nis one of the most controversial of bacteriological problems, and there\r\nis little agreement in the numerous publications regarding it. None the\r\nless, it is far from impossible to get a general idea of what goes on\r\nin an intestinal tract richly charged with microbes.\r\n\r\nAlthough the intestinal wall in an intact state offers a substantial\r\nobstacle to the passage of bacteria, it is incontestable that some\r\nof these pass through it into the organs and the blood. Numerous\r\nexperiments performed on different kinds of animals (horses, dogs,\r\nrabbits, etc.) show that some of the microbes taken with food traverse\r\nthe wall of the alimentary canal and come to occupy the adjacent\r\nlymphatic glands, the lungs, the spleen and the liver, whilst they\r\nare occasionally found in the blood and lymph. Discussion has taken\r\nplace as to whether the passage takes place when the wall of the gut\r\nis absolutely intact or only when it is injured to however small\r\nan extent. It would be extremely difficult to settle the question\r\ndefinitely, but it is easy to see that it has little practical bearing.\r\nIt is known that the wall of the gut is damaged extremely easily, so\r\nthat the bluntest sound can hardly be passed into the stomach without\r\nmaking a wound through which microbes can pass into the tissues and\r\nblood. In the ordinary course of life, the delicate wall of the gut\r\nmust often undergo slight wounding, and the frequent presence of\r\nmicrobes in the mesenteric ganglia of healthy animals shows clearly\r\nwhat takes place.[56]\r\n\r\nIt is indubitable, therefore, that the intestinal microbes or their\r\npoisons may reach the system generally and bring harm to it. I infer\r\nfrom the facts that the more a digestive tract is charged with\r\nmicrobes, the more it is a source of harm capable of shortening life.\r\n\r\nAs the large intestine not only is the part of the digestive tube most\r\nrichly charged with microbes, but is relatively more capacious in\r\nmammals than in any other vertebrates, it is a just inference that the\r\nduration of life of mammals has been notably shortened as the result of\r\nchronic poisoning from an abundant intestinal flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nMICROBES AS THE CAUSE OF SENILITY\r\n\r\n  Relations between longevity and the intestinal\r\n  flora—Ruminants—The Horse—Intestinal flora of\r\n  birds—Intestinal flora of cursorial birds—Duration\r\n  of life in cursorial birds—Flying mammals—Intestinal\r\n  flora and longevity of bats—Some exceptions to the\r\n  rule—Resistance of the lower vertebrates to certain\r\n  intestinal microbes\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the actual state of our knowledge it is impossible to make a final\r\nexamination of my hypothesis, as there are many factors about which we\r\nare incompletely informed. Nevertheless, it is possible to confront the\r\nhypothesis with a large number of accurately established facts.\r\n\r\nAlthough the life of most mammals is relatively short, there are to be\r\nfound in the group some which live relatively long, as well as others\r\nwhose life is short. The elephant is an example of the long-lived\r\nmammals, whilst ruminants are short-lived forms. In the last chapter, I\r\nstated that sheep and cattle became senile at an early age, and did not\r\nlive long. They are striking exceptions to the rule according to which\r\nthe duration of life is in direct relation with the size and length of\r\nthe period of growth. The cow, which is much larger than a woman, and\r\nthe time of gestation of which is about the same, or a little longer,\r\nacquires its teeth at four years old, and becomes senile at an early\r\nage; it is quite old at between sixteen and seventeen, an age when a\r\nwoman is hardly adult; at the age of thirty, practically the extreme\r\nlimit for bovine animals, a woman is in full vigour.\r\n\r\nThe precocious old age of ruminants, the constitution of which is\r\nwell understood, and which are carefully tended, coincides with an\r\nextraordinary richness of the intestinal flora. Food remains for a long\r\ntime in the complicated stomach of these animals, and afterwards the\r\ndigested masses remain still longer in the large intestine. According\r\nto Stohmann and Weiske,[57] in the case of sheep it is a week until\r\nthe remains of a particular meal have finally left the body of the\r\nanimal. The excreta of sheep, normally solid, do not betray any special\r\nputrefaction in the intestine, but if the body is opened there is\r\nabundant evidence of the process. The intestinal contents are richly\r\ncharged with microbes and give off a strong odour of putrefaction. It\r\nis not surprising that under these conditions, the life of sheep should\r\nbe short.\r\n\r\nAnother large herbivorous animal, the horse, also dies young, after a\r\npremature old age. Although it does not ruminate and possesses a simple\r\nstomach, the process of digestion is slow, and enormous masses of\r\nnutritive material accumulate in the huge large intestine. Ellenberger\r\nand Hofmeister[58] have shown that food remains in the alimentary canal\r\nfor nearly four days. It remains in the stomach and the small intestine\r\nonly 24 hours, but about three times as long in the large intestine.\r\nThis is remarkably different from what happens in the case of birds,\r\nin which there is no stagnation during the passage of food through the\r\ndigestive canal.\r\n\r\nThe structure of birds is adapted for flight, the body being as light\r\nas possible, many of the bones and the cavities of the body containing\r\nair-sacs. The absence of a bladder and of a true large intestine\r\nprevents the accumulation of excreta, these being ejected almost as\r\nrapidly as they are formed. The process of ejection, which takes place\r\noften in birds, is not so inconvenient as in mammals. The hind limbs\r\nare not used in flight, so that they offer no obstacle to evacuation.\r\nThus birds may discharge their droppings while flying.\r\n\r\nSuch structure and habits make it not surprising that the alimentary\r\ncanal of many birds contains only a scanty intestinal flora. Parrots,\r\nfor instance, which are remarkably long-lived birds, harbour very few\r\nmicrobes in the intestine. The small intestine contains almost none,\r\nthe rectum so few that the fæcal matter appears to be formed of mucus,\r\nthe waste of the food, and only a very few microbes. M. Michel Cohendy,\r\nwho has examined the intestinal flora at the Pasteur Institute, was\r\nunable to isolate more than five different species of microbes living\r\nin the alimentary canal of parrots.\r\n\r\nEven in birds of prey which feed upon putrid flesh, the number of\r\nmicrobes in the intestine is remarkably limited. I have investigated\r\nthe case of ravens which I fed on flesh which was putrid and swarming\r\nwith microbes. The droppings contained very few bacteria, and it was\r\nspecially remarkable that the intestines had not the slightest smell of\r\nputrefaction. Although the opened body of a herbivorous mammal, such as\r\na rabbit, gives off a strong smell of putrefaction, the body of a raven\r\nwith the digestive tube exposed has no unpleasant smell. This absence\r\nof putrefaction in the intestine is probably the reason of the great\r\nlongevity of such birds as parrots, ravens, and their allies.\r\n\r\nIt might be said, however, that the long duration of life in birds is\r\ndue to the organisation of these animals, rather than to the scantiness\r\nof their intestinal flora. To meet this objection, it is necessary to\r\nturn to the case of cursorial birds.\r\n\r\nThere are some birds incapable of flight, the wings of which are\r\nbadly developed, but which have strong limbs, and can run with great\r\nrapidity. Ostriches, cassowaries, rheas, and tinamous, are well known\r\nexamples of cursorial birds. They live on the surface of the ground,\r\nand their habits resemble those of mammals. When they are attacked\r\nby enemies, they escape by running so quickly that some of them\r\n(ostriches and rheas) outstrip even a horse. However, like mammals,\r\nthey cannot discharge their secretions when they are running quickly.\r\nTinamous (_Rhynchotus rufescens_), which I have observed in captivity,\r\nhowever quickly they may be running, stop abruptly to discharge their\r\nexcretions. M. Debreuil, at my request, made observations on this\r\nmatter, and assured me that the tinamous and rheas (_Rhea americana_)\r\nin his park always stood still for this purpose. He has noticed that\r\nthe droppings, however abundant, were always deposited in heaps.\r\nWith regard to ostriches, M. Rivière, director of the experimental\r\nGardens at Hamma, Algeria, has been kind enough to give me the\r\nfollowing information. “The discharge of excreta,” he said in a letter\r\nin January, 1901, “is less frequent than in other birds, but the\r\ncomparatively small size of the enclosures here makes it impossible for\r\nme to assert that the animal could discharge its droppings if it were\r\nrunning for a length of time; _a priori_ I should think that this did\r\nnot happen. Normally the bird stands still for defæcation, the tuft of\r\nfeathers on the tail is lifted up, and there is a violent contraction\r\nof the abdominal muscles before the sphincters of the cloaca are\r\nsuddenly opened to discharge the excrement with violence.”\r\n\r\nI believe that the remarkable development of the large intestine in\r\nthese running birds has been acquired to obviate the danger which is\r\ncaused by the animal having to stop for defæcation. Although the huge\r\ncæca of these birds have a digestive function, particularly on plants\r\nrich in cellulose, I cannot think that the cæca of cursorial birds have\r\nbeen developed for digestion. As a matter of fact, some birds which\r\nare not cursorial live on the same kind of food (herbage, seeds, and\r\ninsects) and have much smaller cæca, the cæca indeed, in some, for\r\ninstance, the pigeons, being quite rudimentary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Intestinal microbes from the cæca of a Rhea.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the accumulation of food material in the\r\nlarge intestine of running birds is associated with the presence of\r\nan extremely rich intestinal flora. Microscopic examination of the\r\nexcrement of such birds shows this at once. Although the intestinal\r\ncontents and excrement of many other birds show the presence of\r\nvery few microbes, belonging to a small number of species, the same\r\nmaterials taken from running birds show enormous quantities of\r\nmicrobes, belonging to a large number of species. In the cæcum of\r\nthe rhea (Fig. 14) there are bacterial threads, spirilla, bacilli,\r\nvibrios, and many kinds of cocci. In the tinamous, the intestinal flora\r\nis if possible even richer. According to the statistical investigations\r\nof M. Michel Cohendy, the quantity of intestinal microbes in cursorial\r\nbirds is not less than that found in mammals, even in man.\r\n\r\nIf I am correct in the view that I have been explaining, cursorial\r\nbirds, on account of their rich intestinal flora, ought to have a\r\nshorter duration of life than that of flying birds. I will now turn to\r\nthis side of the question. Amongst cursorial forms, there are some of\r\nthe largest living birds, ostriches being actually the largest living\r\nbirds, whilst an extinct running bird, the _Aepyornis_ of Madagascar,\r\nwas the largest known bird. According to the rule that large animals\r\nlive longer than small animals, ostriches should be able to reach a\r\ngreat age. The facts, however, are against this. M. Rivière, who rears\r\nostriches in Algeria, and has a great experience of them, writes to me\r\nas follows: “I have no confidence in the stories about the longevity of\r\nthe ostrich which were told me in the Sahara; they rest on no facts.\r\nMy personal observation is not very large, but it is quite exact. Some\r\nof the ostriches which have been hatched here have lived for 26 years.\r\nI do not estimate the duration of life of this bird at more than 35\r\nyears, and only one case of this age have I seen myself in 20 years.\r\nThe bird was a female, a good layer and sitter; she died of old age,\r\nshowing all the signs of decrepitude, the skin excoriated and lumpy,\r\nthe feathers degenerate and dry. The bird laid eggs until nearly the\r\nend of her life, but at irregular intervals, and the shells were\r\ngranular instead of being smooth and polished.”\r\n\r\nIn a farm near Nice, where ostriches are reared, there was recently an\r\nold male called “Kruger,” which was supposed to be 50 years old.[59]\r\nCountess Stackelberg has been good enough to try to get information\r\nfor me about this, and informs me that although they have not exact\r\nknowledge at the farm, they believe that it must be 50 years old. M.\r\nRivière thinks this statement very surprising, and has nothing in his\r\nown long experience to confirm it.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I have been able to get together do not attribute a\r\nlong life to other running birds. Gurney mentions that a cassowary\r\n(_Casuarius westermanni_) lived 26 years in the Zoological Gardens of\r\nRotterdam, and that three Australian emus (_Dromaeus novae-hollandiae_)\r\nhad lived in the same Gardens for 28, 22, and 20 years. M. Oustalet\r\n(_Ornis_, 1899, vol. x, p. 62) mentions another emu of the same\r\nspecies which died in London at the age of over 23 years. The rhea\r\n(_Rhea americana_), another large running bird, does not live so long.\r\n“Boecking thinks that its duration of life should be set down at from\r\n14 to 15 years. According to him, many of these birds die of old age.”\r\n(Brehm, _Oiseaux_, vol. ii, p. 517).\r\n\r\nIt is striking to compare the short life of cursorial birds, which\r\nnevertheless thrive and reproduce in captivity, with the remarkable\r\nlongevity of so many other birds (parrots, birds of prey) which,\r\nalthough they are much smaller, have been kept alive for from 80 to\r\n100 years. It would be difficult to find a more striking argument in\r\nfavour of the view that richness of the intestinal flora shortens life.\r\nWhen birds become adapted to terrestrial life and acquire a huge large\r\nintestine in which microbes can abound, their duration of life is\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nJust as some birds, losing the aerial mode of life, have come to\r\nresemble mammals, so also some mammals have become flying animals,\r\nprovided with wings and in some respects resembling birds. Bats are\r\nthe most familiar instance. The large intestine, which is extremely\r\nuseful to running animals, not only ceases to be an advantage but is\r\nharmful to flying creatures, insomuch as it increases the weight of\r\nthe body uselessly. Bats, accordingly, have no cæcum whilst the large\r\nintestine is changed in structure and function. Instead of being a\r\ncapacious tube, serving as a reservoir for the refuse of the food, the\r\nlarge intestine of bats has the same diameter as the small intestine.\r\nIts structure is nearly identical. It is provided with glands, and\r\nas I have already mentioned in the last chapter, it digests the food\r\nin the same way as the small intestine. In fact, the large intestine\r\nhas become simply a part of the small intestine, the total length of\r\nthe gut being reduced. Bats, therefore, can no longer retain their\r\nsecretions but have to empty the intestine almost as often as most\r\nbirds. I find that Indian fruit bats (_Pteropus medius_) discharge\r\ntheir excreta very often. Microscopic examination shows that there\r\nis an absence of microbes quite unusual in the case of a mammal.\r\nThe alimentary canal of bats is nearly aseptic, containing only a\r\nfew single bacteria. I have fed these fruit bats with the same food\r\n(carrots) which I have given to rabbits, guinea pigs, and mice; whilst\r\nthe bats accomplished the process of digestion in 1-1/2 hours, and\r\ndeposited excreta containing fragments of carrot, the rodents took\r\nvery much longer for digestion and large quantities of waste matter\r\naccumulated in the cæca. The intestinal flora too, although the food\r\nin each case was the same, showed remarkable differences in these\r\nanimals. It was almost absent in the bats, whilst in the rabbits,\r\nguinea-pigs and mice it consisted of a mass of microbes of different\r\nspecies. The excrement of the bats had no unpleasant odour, and the\r\ndigestive canal of these bird-like mammals was free from putrefaction.\r\nFruit bats fed upon fruit discharged excreta with a pleasant odour of\r\napples and bananas. We have seen that birds which live a life similar\r\nto that of mammals acquire a rich intestinal flora and do not live so\r\nlong as aerial birds. It would be extremely interesting to ascertain\r\nthe duration of life of bats, mammals which live like birds and have\r\na very scanty intestinal flora. I have been unable to get any exact\r\ninformation as to the duration of life of the true bats, that is to\r\nsay, the insectivorous bats, as all the requests that I have addressed\r\nto specialists have proved fruitless. It appears, however, that it is\r\na popular belief that bats live long. There is a Flemish phrase: “as\r\nlong-lived as a bat,” and a similar phrase is common in Little Russia.\r\n\r\nAs for the fruit-eating bats, I have been able to ascertain that even\r\nin captivity, where the conditions are unfavourable to them, the\r\nduration of life is relatively long. I have had in my own possession a\r\nfruit bat (_Pteropus medius_) which was bought in Marseilles 14 years\r\nago. It showed no signs of old age, and the teeth were in perfect\r\ncondition. It died of some acute disease accidentally contracted. I\r\nknow of another bat of the same species which lived in captivity for\r\nmore than 15 years, and I have been informed that[60] in the London\r\nZoological Gardens, a fruit bat has lived for 17 years. If these bats\r\nwere adult when caught, it would be necessary to add something to the\r\nknown figures.\r\n\r\nAlthough I do not know the exact duration of the life of bats, it is\r\nclearly relatively long for mammals no bigger than guinea-pigs. The\r\ndifference is remarkable if we compare it with the life of sheep, dogs\r\nand rabbits, mammals very much larger in size, but possessed of a rich\r\nintestinal flora.\r\n\r\nThe series of facts that I have been discussing strengthens my\r\nconviction that the intestinal flora is an extremely important factor\r\nin the causation of senility. It must not be supposed, however, that\r\nall the known facts can be explained equally easily on this hypothesis.\r\nThe harm done by microbes cannot always be measured by their abundance\r\nin the alimentary canal. In the first place, it must be remembered\r\nthat some microbes are useful; moreover, microbes, even although their\r\nproducts are very dangerous, may exist in quantities in an organism,\r\nand yet do no harm if the organism has the power of resisting bacterial\r\npoisons. Thus, for instance, the bacillus of tetanus, which thrives\r\nin the alimentary canal, and which can endanger life if the wall of\r\nthe gut is wounded, does not harm a crocodile or a tortoise, as these\r\nanimals are extremely resistant to the poison of tetanus. Dr. Favorsky,\r\nby experiments at the Pasteur Institute, has shown that the poison of\r\nbotulism can be absorbed with impunity by some birds, and by tortoises,\r\nalthough death follows if a very small quantity of it be introduced\r\ninto the alimentary canal of a mammal.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of man and of higher animals are possessed of a complex\r\nmechanism which resists the harmful action of bacteria and their\r\npoisons. The various parts of this mechanism may act differently, with\r\nthe result that there is great variation in the power of resistance.\r\nThus, however abundant microbes may be in the intestine, they may\r\nbring little harm to an organism that has a high power of destruction\r\nor neutralisation of the toxins, or when these harmful products are\r\nunable to pass through the intestinal wall. It is in this way that I\r\nexplain some exceptions to the general rule, which are exceptions only\r\nin appearance. Such a case is that of the nocturnal birds of prey.\r\nAlthough the diurnal birds of prey (eagles, vultures, etc.) have very\r\nshort cæca, in which the food is never found, owls have very large\r\ncæca, which may be as long as 10 cm. (Eagle-Owl, _Bubo maximus_). These\r\nlong cæca, however, contain debris of the food only in the enlarged\r\nterminal portion, and the food masses contain a very small number of\r\nmicrobes. Notwithstanding a great difference in the length of the cæca\r\nbetween the owls and the eagles, these two groups of birds do not\r\ndiffer greatly in longevity. But the difference in the cæca does not\r\nimply a corresponding difference in the intestinal flora which appears\r\nto be very scanty in both cases.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the elephant is a more real exception to the rule.\r\nHere is a case of a mammal with an enormous large intestine and a\r\ncapacious cæcum, and which none the less is capable of surviving for a\r\ncentury. I have had no opportunity of investigating the elephant from\r\nthis point of view, and have no explanation to suggest.\r\n\r\nMonkeys and man differ from most mammals in so far as they possess\r\na long duration of life, although their large intestines are very\r\ncapacious. I have been unable to get exact information as to the\r\nlongevity of monkeys, but I understand that these animals live longer\r\nthan domesticated mammals, such as the ox, sheep, dog, and cat.\r\nAnthropoid apes are supposed to be able to reach the age of 50 years.\r\nThe only other mammal with a longevity similar to that of the elephant\r\nis man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nDURATION OF HUMAN LIFE\r\n\r\n  Longevity of man—Theory of Ebstein on the normal\r\n  duration of human life—Instances of human\r\n  longevity—Circumstances which may explain the long\r\n  duration of human life\r\n\r\n\r\nMan has inherited from his mammalian ancestors his organisation and\r\nqualities. His life is notably shorter than that of many reptiles, but\r\nlonger than that of many birds and most other mammals. None the less\r\nhe has inherited a capacious large intestine in which a most abundant\r\nintestinal flora flourishes.\r\n\r\nGestation and the period of growth are long in the human race, and\r\nfrom the point of view of theoretical considerations, human longevity\r\nshould be longer than it generally is. Haller, a distinguished Swiss\r\nphysiologist of the 18th century, thought that man ought to live to 200\r\nyears; Buffon was of the opinion that when a man did not die from some\r\naccident or disease he would reach 90 or 100 years.\r\n\r\nAccording to Flourens, man takes 20 years to grow and ought to live 5\r\ntimes 20, that is to say, 100 years.\r\n\r\nThe actual longevity is much below these figures, which are based\r\non theory. I have shown, moreover, that even if the rule based on\r\nthe theory of growth can be accepted as generally true, it cannot be\r\napplied in every case, as the factors controlling duration of life are\r\nvery variable.\r\n\r\nStatistics show that the highest human mortality occurs in the earliest\r\nyears of life. In the first year after birth alone, one quarter of the\r\nchildren die. After this period of maximum mortality, the death-rate\r\nslowly falls until the age of puberty, and then rises again slowly and\r\ncontinuously. It reaches a second maximum between the ages of 60 and\r\n75, and then slowly falls again to the extreme limit of longevity.\r\n\r\nBodio,[61] an Italian man of science, holds the view that the great\r\nmortality of infants is a natural adaptation to prevent too great an\r\nincrease of the human race. This view, however, cannot be supported,\r\nand rational hygiene readily brings about a great diminution in the\r\nmortality of children. The cause of mortality is in most cases maladies\r\nof the intestinal canal, produced by erroneous diet, and with the\r\nadvance of civilisation, infant mortality has been very greatly reduced.\r\n\r\nI find it impossible to accept the view that the high mortality between\r\nthe ages of 70 and 75 indicates a natural limit of human life. As\r\na result of investigations into mortality in most of the European\r\ncountries, Lexis came to the conclusion that the normal duration of\r\nhuman life was not more than 75 years. Dr. Ebstein[62] accepts this\r\nstatistical result and announces that “we now know the normal limit set\r\nby nature to the life of mankind. This limit is at the age of maximum\r\nmortality. If man dies before then, his death is premature. Everyone\r\ndoes not reach the normal limit; life ends generally before it, and\r\nonly in rare cases after it.”\r\n\r\nThe fact that many men of from 70 to 75 years old are well preserved,\r\nboth physically and intellectually, makes it impossible to regard that\r\nage as the natural limit of human life. Philosophers such as Plato,\r\npoets such as Goethe and Victor Hugo, artists such as Michael Angelo,\r\nTitian and Franz Hals, produced some of their most important works\r\nwhen they had passed what Lexis and Ebstein regard as the limit of\r\nlife. Moreover, deaths of people at that age are rarely due to senile\r\ndebility. In Paris, for instance, in 1902, of cases of deaths between\r\nthe ages of 70 and 74, only 8·5 per cent. were due to old age.[63]\r\nInfectious diseases, such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, diseases of the\r\nheart and the kidneys, and cerebral hæmorrhage, caused most of the\r\ndeaths of these old people. Such cases of death, however, can often be\r\navoided and must be regarded as accidental rather than natural.\r\n\r\nConfirmation of the view that the natural limit is not at 70 to 75\r\nyears is to be found in the fact that so many men reach a greater age.\r\nCentenarians are really not rare. In France, for instance, nearly one\r\nhundred and fifty people die every year, after having reached the age\r\nof 100 or more. In 1836, in a population of thirty-three millions and\r\na half (33,540,910), there were 146 centenarians, that is to say, one\r\nin about 220,000 inhabitants. In some other countries, particularly in\r\nEastern Europe, the number of centenarians is still greater. In Greece,\r\nfor instance, there is a centenarian for each set of 25,641 living\r\npersons, that is to say, nine times as many as in France.[64]\r\n\r\nWhat age can be reached by the human species? Formerly it was supposed\r\nthat individuals might live for several centuries; to say nothing\r\nof Methuselah, whose age of 969 years, mentioned in the Bible, is\r\nthe result of a mistake in calculation, I may mention Nestor, who,\r\naccording to Homer, lived for three human ages, that is to say, 300\r\nyears, or Dando, the Illyrian, and the King of the Lacedaemon,\r\nwho were supposed to have reached ages of five or six centuries. These\r\nancient records are, of course, quite incorrect. Much more confidence\r\ncan be placed in some facts relating to more modern times, according to\r\nwhich the extreme old age reached by man was 185 years. Kentigern, the\r\nfounder of the Cathedral of Glasgow, known by the name of St. Mungo,\r\ndied at the age of 185, on Jan. 5th, 600.[65] Another astonishing case\r\nof longevity is related from Hungary, where an agriculturist, Pierre\r\nZortay, born in 1539, died in 1724. The Hungarian records of the 18th\r\ncentury contain other cases of death at ages between 147 and 172 years.\r\n\r\nThe case of Drakenberg is still more authentic; he was born in Norway\r\nin 1626 and died in 1772, at the age of 146. He was known as the Old\r\nMan of the North. He had been captured by African pirates and was held\r\nby them for fifteen years, and was engaged as a sailor for ninety-one\r\nyears. His romantic history attracted contemporary attention, and the\r\njournals of the time (_Gazette de France_, 1764, _Gazette d’Utrecht_,\r\n1767, etc.)[66] contain information regarding him. The well-known\r\ninstance of Thomas Parr appears to rest on good authority. Parr was\r\na poor Shropshire peasant, who did hard work until he was 130 years\r\nold, and who died in London at the age of 152 years and 9 months. The\r\ncelebrated Harvey examined the body after death and was unable to\r\ndiscover organic disease; even the cartilages of the ribs were not\r\nossified and were elastic as in a young man. The brain, however, was\r\nhard and resisting to the touch, as its blood-vessels were thickened\r\nand dry. Parr was buried in Westminster Abbey.[67]\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that human beings may reach the age of 150, but such\r\ncases are certainly extremely rare, and are not known from the records\r\nof the last two centuries. I cannot accept without a good deal of\r\nreserve the statements as to two persons who died in the beginning of\r\nthe 19th century at the ages of 142 and 145. On the other hand, cases\r\nof duration of life from 100 to 120 years are not very rare.\r\n\r\nExtreme longevity is not limited to the white races. According to\r\nPrichard,[68] negroes have lived respectively to 115, 160, and 180\r\nyears. In the course of the 19th century there have been observed, in\r\nSenegal, eight negroes ranging from 100 to 121 years old. M. Chemin[69]\r\nsaw himself in 1898 at Foundiougne an old man, whom the natives stated\r\nto be 108 years of age; although he was in good health, he had been\r\nblind for several years. The same author, on the authority of the _New\r\nYork Herald_ of June 13th, 1895, mentions the case of a coloured woman\r\nin North Carolina, who was more than 140 years old, and of a man 125\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nWomen more frequently become centenarians than men, although the\r\ndifference is not very great. For instance, in Greece, in 1885, in a\r\npopulation of nearly two millions (1,947,760), there were 278 persons\r\naged from 95 to 110 years, of whom 133 were male and 145 female.\r\n\r\nIn the seven years, from 1833 to 1839 inclusive, according to Chemin,\r\nthere were in Paris twenty-six men over the age of 95, and forty-five\r\nwomen. Such facts, and many others, support the general proposition\r\nthat male mortality is always greater than that of the other sex.\r\n\r\nIn most cases centenarians are notably healthy and of strong\r\nconstitution. There are instances, however, of abnormal people having\r\nreached a great age. A woman, called Nicoline Marc, died in 1760, at\r\nthe age of 110. Since she was two years old, her left arm was crippled.\r\nHer hand was bent under the arm like a hook. She was a hunch-back, and\r\nso bent that she appeared to be no more than four feet high. A Scotch\r\nwoman, Elspeth Wilson, died at the age of 115 years. She was quite\r\na dwarf, being only a little over two feet high. On the other hand,\r\nalthough they usually have a very short life, giants have been known to\r\nreach the age of 100.\r\n\r\nHaller, in the eighteenth century, remarked that centenarians often\r\noccurred in the same family, as if longevity were a hereditary\r\nquality. It is certainly the case that the descendants of centenarians\r\nfrequently reach extreme age. Thomas Parr, for instance, left a son\r\nwho died in 1761, at the age of 127 years, having retained his mental\r\nfaculties until death. In M. Chemin’s list of centenarians, there\r\nare eighteen cases of extreme old age having been reached by their\r\nrelations. As all innate characters can be transmitted, the influence\r\nof heredity and longevity must be admitted. At the same time, it\r\nis necessary to remember the important influence of the similarity\r\nof conditions in the case of parents and children. Many cases of\r\ntuberculosis and leprosy, which used to be assigned to heredity, are\r\nnow known to be due to infection in the same conditions of life, and\r\nsome of the examples of the attaining of a great age by more than one\r\nmember of a family may be explained by the influence of surrounding\r\ncircumstances. Very frequently the husband and wife, although not\r\nrelated by blood, both attain extremely advanced age. I found 22 cases\r\nof this kind in M. Chemin’s list; I will give a few of them. A widow,\r\nAnne Barak, died at the age of 123, in Moravia; her husband died at the\r\nage of 118. In 1896, there was alive in Constantinople, M. Christaki,\r\na retired army doctor of the age of 110; his wife was 95 years old.\r\nIn 1886, M. et Mme. Gallot, aged respectively 105 years and 4 months,\r\nand 105 years and one month, died within two days of each other at\r\nVaugirard, 54, Rue Cambronne. Lejoncourt mentions a South American of\r\n143 years old, whose wife had lived to the age of 117.\r\n\r\nIt is worth enquiring if there be any relation between longevity and\r\nlocality. There are some countries in which very many of the natives\r\nreach old age. It appears that Eastern Europe (Balkan States, and\r\nRussia), although its civilisation is not high, contains many more\r\ncentenarians than Western Europe. I have already mentioned that Dr.\r\nOrnstein had shown the existence of many extremely old people in\r\nGreece. M. Chemin states that in Servia, Bulgaria and Roumania there\r\nwere more than 5,000 centenarians (5,545) living in 1896. “Although\r\nthese figures appear to be exaggerated,” wrote M. Chemin, “it is\r\nundoubtedly the case that the pure and keen air of the Balkans, and\r\nthe pastoral or agricultural life of the natives, predisposes to old\r\nage.” The same author mentions several localities in France, notable\r\nfor the numbers of very old people. In 1898 in the commune of Sournia\r\n(Pyrénées-Orientales) the total population was 600, amongst which there\r\nwas one woman of 95 years, a man of 94, a woman of 89, two men of 85,\r\ntwo of 84, and two of 83, three women of 82, and two men of 80. At St.\r\nBlimont in the Department of the Somme, amongst the 400 inhabitants\r\nalive in 1897, there were six men between the ages of 85 and 93 years\r\nand one woman in her 101st year.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be accepted that it is the keen air which lengthens the life,\r\nbecause Switzerland, a mountainous country, is notable for the rarity\r\nof centenarians. It is more likely that some circumstance in the mode\r\nof living influences longevity.\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that most centenarians have been people who were\r\npoor, or in humble circumstances, and whose life has been extremely\r\nsimple. There are instances of rich centenarians, such as Sir Moses\r\nMontefiore who died at the age of 101, but such are extremely rare.\r\nIt may well be said that great riches do not bring a very long life.\r\nPoverty generally brings with it sobriety, especially in old age, and\r\nit has been often said that most centenarians have lived an extremely\r\nsober life. They have not all followed the example of the celebrated\r\nCornaro, who brought himself to subsist on a daily diet of no more than\r\ntwelve ounces of solid food, and fourteen ounces of wine, and who,\r\nalthough his constitution was weak, lived for about a century. He has\r\nleft extremely interesting Memoirs, and retained his intelligence until\r\nhis death on the 26th April, 1566 (Lejoncourt, p. 146).\r\n\r\nIn M. Chemin’s list I have counted twenty-six centenarians,\r\ndistinguished by their frugal life. Most of them did not drink wine,\r\nand many of them limited themselves to bread, milk and vegetables.\r\n\r\nSobriety is certainly favourable to long life, but it is not necessary,\r\nbecause quite a number of centenarians have drunk freely. Several of\r\nthose who are catalogued by Chemin, drank wine and spirits even to\r\nexcess. Catherine Reymond, for instance, who died in 1758 at the age of\r\n107 years, drank much wine, and Politiman, a surgeon who lived from\r\n1685 to 1825, was in the habit, from his twenty-fifth year onwards, of\r\ngetting drunk every night, after having attended to his practice all\r\nday. Gascogne, a butcher of Trie (Hautes-Pyrénées), died in 1767 at the\r\nage of 120, and had been accustomed to get drunk twice a week. A most\r\ncurious example is that of the Irish land-owner Brawn, who lived to the\r\nage of 120, and who had an inscription put upon his tombstone that he\r\nwas always drunk, and when in that condition was so terrible that even\r\ndeath had been afraid of him. Some districts, even, are distinguished\r\nat once for the longevity of their inhabitants and for the large local\r\nconsumption of alcohol. In 1897, village of Chailly in the Côte-d’Or\r\nhad no less than twenty octogenarians amongst 523 inhabitants. This\r\nvillage is one of the localities in France where most alcohol is\r\nconsumed, and the old people are very far from being distinguished from\r\ntheir younger fellows by any special sobriety.\r\n\r\nIn some cases centenarians have been much addicted to the drinking\r\nof coffee. The reader will recall Voltaire’s reply when his doctor\r\ndescribed the grave harm that comes from abuse of coffee which acts as\r\na real poison. “Well,” said Voltaire, “I have been poisoning myself for\r\nnearly 80 years.” There are centenarians who have lived longer than\r\nVoltaire, and have drunk still more coffee. Elisabeth Durieux, a native\r\nof Savoy, reached the age of 114. Her principal food was coffee, of\r\nwhich she took daily as many as forty small cups. She was jovial and a\r\nboon table companion, and used black coffee in quantities that would\r\nhave surprised an Arab. Her coffee-pot was always on the fire, like the\r\ntea-pot in an English cottage (Lejoncourt, p. 84; Chemin, p. 147).\r\n\r\nIt has been noticed that many centenarians do not smoke, but this like\r\nall other traits is not universal. M. Ross, who gained a prize for\r\nlongevity in 1896 at the age of 102, was an inveterate smoker. In 1897,\r\na widow named Lazennec, died at La Carrière, in Kérinou, Finistère, at\r\nthe age of 104. She lived in a hovel on charity, and she had smoked a\r\npipe ever since she was quite young.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that any factor to which long duration of life has been\r\nattributed disappears when many cases are examined. Naturally a sound\r\nconstitution and a simple and sober life are favourable to longevity,\r\nbut apart from these, there is something unknown which tends to long\r\nlife. The celebrated physiologist of Bonn, Pflüger,[70] came to\r\nthe conclusion that the chief condition of longevity is something\r\n“intrinsic in the constitution,” something which cannot be defined\r\nexactly, and which must be set down to inheritance.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of knowledge, we cannot denote the chief cause of\r\nhuman longevity, but the proper course will be to seek it out as we\r\nwould seek out that of animal longevity. As human longevity is often\r\nlocal in its character, and is exhibited by married people who have\r\nnothing in common except their mode of life, we may enquire into the\r\nintestinal flora and the mechanism by which the organism resists its\r\nharmful effect as factors which influence the duration of life. It is\r\nreasonable to suppose that in persons living in the same district or\r\nunder the same roof, the intestinal flora may be similar. The problem\r\ncan be settled only by a series of laborious researches which have yet\r\nto be made. At present I can do no more than bring together a large\r\nnumber of facts regarding the duration of life in man and in animals,\r\nwith the hope of suggesting the lines for future investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATIONS ON NATURAL DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nNATURAL DEATH AMONG PLANTS\r\n\r\n  Theory of the immortality of unicellular\r\n  organisms—Examples of very old trees—Examples of\r\n  short-lived plants—Prolongation of the life of some\r\n  plants—Theory of the natural death of plants by\r\n  exhaustion—Death of plants from auto-intoxication\r\n\r\n\r\nIt must surprise my readers to find how little science really knows\r\nabout death. Although death has a preponderating place in religions,\r\nsystems of philosophy, literature and folk-lore, scientific works pay\r\nlittle attention to it. This unfortunate fact explains, although it may\r\nnot justify, the bitter attack made on science on the grounds that it\r\nis occupied with minutiæ and neglects the great problems of human life,\r\nsuch as death. When Tolstoi was absorbed by the problem and searched\r\nfor some solution in the writings of scientific men, he found that the\r\nexplanations were trivial or inexact. In consequence he was extremely\r\nindignant with the men who devoted themselves to the investigation of\r\nwhat seemed to him useless problems (such as the insect world, or the\r\nstructure of cells and tissues) and who were yet unable to say what the\r\ndestiny of man or death might be.\r\n\r\nI am far from claiming to solve these problems; I can do little more\r\nthan describe the actual state of the question of natural death. I hope\r\nin this way at least to prepare for scientific investigation, and to\r\ncall attention to it as the most important problem of humanity.\r\n\r\nBy the use of the phrase “natural death” I mean to denote a phenomenon\r\nthat is intrinsic in the nature of an organism and that is not the mere\r\nresult of an external accident. Popular phraseology includes under\r\nnatural death all cases due to diseases. But as such deaths can be\r\navoided and are not due to qualities inherent in the organism, it is\r\nerroneous to include them in the category “natural death.”\r\n\r\nIn nature, death comes so frequently by accident that there is\r\njustification for asking if natural death really occurs. It used to be\r\nthought that death was the inevitable end of life and that the living\r\nprinciple contained within itself the germ of death. Accordingly,\r\nit was a surprising discovery that many low organisms die only by\r\naccident, and that if such accident be avoided, death does not fall on\r\nthem. Unicellular organisms (such as infusoria, many other protozoa\r\nand low plants) multiply by simple division, the organism thus giving\r\nrise to two new organisms; the parent so to speak loses itself in its\r\noffspring without undergoing death. To criticisms of this mode of\r\npresentment of the facts, Weismann, who has attracted most attention\r\nto the view, replied as follows:—“In cultures of Infusoria, these\r\nlittle animals continually multiply by division and no dead bodies are\r\nfound. The individual life is short, but it ends not in death but in\r\ntransformation to two new individuals.”\r\n\r\nMax Verworn,[71] a physiologist of repute, objected that Weismann had\r\noverlooked the occurrence within the organism of a process of partial\r\ndestruction, and that under certain conditions a complete organ of\r\nthe infusorian body (the nucleus) dies and is absorbed. Such death of\r\na part, however, is not followed by death of the whole, and as the\r\ncontinuous destruction of some of the cells in our own bodies is not\r\nregarded as our death, the criticism of the German physiologist cannot\r\nbe accepted.\r\n\r\nIt is not only the extremely short-lived microscopic organisms that\r\nescape death. Some of the higher plants, which may attain to gigantic\r\nsize, encounter death only by accidents. There is nothing to be found\r\nin the nature of their organisation which would seem to indicate that\r\ndeath is the inevitable or even probable result of their constitutions.\r\n\r\nThe longevity of some trees has long been notorious, as these appear to\r\nlive for many centuries and to die only when they are overwhelmed by\r\nthe ravages of a storm or killed by human agency.\r\n\r\nWhen the Canary Islands were discovered, in the beginning of the\r\nfifteenth century, the early explorers were struck with the gigantic\r\nsize of a dragon tree which was venerated by the natives as their\r\ntutelary deity. The tree stood in a Garden at Orotava in Teneriffe,\r\nand even in these early days, its huge trunk contained a gigantic\r\nhollow. The tree did not reward the worship of the natives, who\r\nwere annihilated by the Spaniards, and it survived them for nearly\r\nfour centuries. At the end of the eighteenth century it was seen\r\nby Humboldt,[72] who found that the trunk was forty-five feet in\r\ncircumference, and who attributed to it a great age because dragon\r\ntrees grow extremely slowly. Early in the nineteenth century (1819) a\r\nfurious tempest swept over Orotava and with a gigantic crash nearly\r\na third of the crown of leaves and branches fell on the ground.\r\nNotwithstanding this shock, the monster survived for fifty years.\r\nBerthelot,[73] who visited it in 1839, described it as follows:—“A\r\ndragon tree stood in front of my dwelling, grotesque in form, gigantic\r\nin size, which a storm had smitten without overwhelming. Ten men would\r\nhave much ado to girdle its vast trunk, fifty feet in circumference at\r\nthe ground. The huge column had a deep cave within it, hollowed by the\r\nages; a rustic porch gave access to the interior, and the lofty dome,\r\nalthough half had been destroyed by a storm, still bore an enormous\r\ncrown of branches.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—The Dragon-tree of the villa Orotava.]\r\n\r\nThe famous dragon-tree got more and more damaged, and was finally\r\noverthrown by a storm in 1868. A few years after the catastrophe (in\r\n1871) I myself saw the remains of the colossus, lying on the ground as\r\na huge grey mass like some antediluvian monster. No accurate estimate\r\nof its age can be formed, but it must have lived several thousand years.\r\n\r\nTrees have been known which were still older than the dragon-tree of\r\nTeneriffe. One of the best known is the baobab of Cape Verd, described\r\nby Adanson. “This remarkable tree was thirty feet in diameter when the\r\nfamous French naturalist measured and described it. Three centuries\r\nearlier, some English sailors had cut an inscription on it, and\r\nAdanson laid this bare by removing three hundred layers of wood. On\r\nhis observations Adanson based an estimate of 5,150 years as the age\r\nof the tree.[74] The old cypresses of Mexico are thought to be still\r\nolder. A. de Candolle[75] concluded that the cypress of Montezuma was\r\n2,000 years old when he saw it, and that the cypress at Oazaca was much\r\nolder than the tree described by Adanson. In California, trees of the\r\nspecies _Sequoia gigantea_ are three thousand years old, and Sargent,\r\nan American botanist, attributes to some of them an age of at least\r\nfive thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe question of the nature of individuality in the vegetable world\r\nhas been raised in connection with the longevity of trees. It has\r\nbeen asked if a tree is to be regarded as a single individual or as\r\na colony of many plants like a branching polyp. It is a difficult\r\nquestion, but only of secondary importance from the point of view of\r\nthis discussion. A. de Candolle,[76] having paid special attention to\r\nthe subject, came to the conclusion that trees do not die of old age,\r\nthat, in the real sense of the phrase, there is no natural end of their\r\nexistence. Many botanists agree with him. Naegeli[77] holds that a tree\r\nseveral thousand years old dies only from external accidents.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that amongst the lower plants and the higher plants there\r\nare cases where natural death does not exist. Theoretically, life would\r\nhave an unlimited duration, subject to the continuous replacement of\r\nthe substance of the organism in the normal metabolism. It must not be\r\ninferred, however, that there is no such occurrence as natural death\r\namongst plants. There are numerous cases where death comes quite apart\r\nfrom the agency of external forces. Even amongst closely related plants\r\nthere are some cases where natural death does not occur, and others\r\nwhere it is normal. The lower fungi offer a good instance. Some of\r\nthese pass through a longer or shorter vegetative stage and then the\r\nliving mass breaks up into spores (_Myxomycetes_). The whole bulk of\r\nmatter is not transformed, but the remnant consists only of cuticular\r\nsecretions, not living cells. In other fungi, only some of the cells\r\ntransform to spores, the others dying naturally.\r\n\r\nOne stage of the life history of some lower plants is of short\r\nduration. The prothalli of some cryptogams (_Marsiliaceæ_) live only a\r\nfew hours, just long enough for the appearance of the sexual organs.\r\nWhen these are ripe the body of the prothallus and all its constituent\r\ncells fall a prey to natural death. In such cases there is a “corpse,”\r\ncomposed of dead cells and protoplasm. Even amongst the higher plants\r\nthere are instances of an extremely short duration of life. _Amaryllis\r\nlutea_ passes through all the stages of its life-history in ten days,\r\nthe minimum time necessary for the sprouting of the leaves and flowers\r\nand the production of the seeds, after which it dies naturally.[78] It\r\nis interesting to find that in the same family there are other plants\r\nnotable for long duration of life. The Agave requires a century to\r\nproduce its flowers before death comes naturally.\r\n\r\nEveryone is familiar with the so-called “annual” plants which live\r\nonly a few months, from the time when they sprout, until, after the\r\nproduction of seed, death comes to them naturally. The life of annuals,\r\nhowever, can be preserved for two or for several years. Rye is normally\r\nan annual, but some varieties are able to live for two years and\r\nproduce two crops. The Cossacks of the Don have established this fact,\r\nand have cultivated a biennial variety of rye for many years.[79]\r\nBeetroot[80] is normally biennial, but has been changed to a plant\r\nwhich lives for from three to five years. Such instances are by no\r\nmeans unique.\r\n\r\nNatural death can be postponed if the plant be prevented from seeding.\r\nProfessor Hugo de Vries has prolonged the life of the Oenotheras he\r\ncultivates, by cutting the flowers before fertilisation. Under ordinary\r\nconditions the stem dies after producing from forty to fifty flowers,\r\nbut, if cutting be practised, new flowers are produced until the winter\r\ncold intervenes. By cutting the stem sufficiently early, the plants are\r\ninduced to develop new buds at the base, and these buds survive winter,\r\nand resume growth in the following spring.” (Extract from a letter of\r\nProf. H. de Vries.)\r\n\r\nThe grass of lawns is usually mowed before it begins to flower, so as\r\nto prevent the ripening of the seeds and the death of the plant. When\r\nthis is done, the grass remains continually green, and its life lasts\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\nThe connection between the seeding of plants and their natural death\r\nhas been recognised for long, and is usually explained as being due to\r\nthe exhaustion of the plant.\r\n\r\nAs I am not a botanist, and was anxious to know the views of botanists\r\non natural death, I wrote to Prof. de Vries, as a universally accepted\r\nauthority. The distinguished botanist replied to me as follows. “Your\r\nquestion is extremely difficult. I do not think that much is known as\r\nto the exact cause of the death of annual plants, but it is customary\r\nto attribute it to exhaustion.” All the botanists who have expressed\r\nopinions on this matter appear to hold a similar view. Hildebrand,[81]\r\nthe author of a memoir on the duration of life in plants, stated this\r\nview again and again. According to him “the life of annuals is usually\r\nshort because they are exhausted by their extensive production of seeds\r\n(p. 116).” “Even amongst plants which produce seeds for several years,\r\nthere are some which are prematurely exhausted by fructification and\r\nwhich die spontaneously” (p. 67). In the prothallus of many of the\r\nhigher cryptogams, the formation of a single embryo is followed by\r\nnatural death; as Goebel[82] points out, the embryo completely absorbs\r\nthe prothallus.\r\n\r\nAs plants generally obtain their food with ease, it is natural to ask\r\nwhat is the cause of the exhaustion after seeding. When a plant which\r\ncannot resist cold dies after it has produced its seeds in the end of\r\nthe summer, the event is natural enough. But how can we explain the\r\ndeath of an annual plant which is growing in a rich soil, and which\r\nseeds in the beginning of the summer, as being due to exhaustion long\r\nbefore the winter cold. It frequently happens that after harvest new\r\nshoots spring up from grains which have fallen. The soil which can\r\nsupport this new vegetation cannot have been exhausted by the cereal\r\nin question; and there has been enough warmth for the new crop. It\r\ncannot be the external conditions which have caused the death of\r\nthe parent plant. The explanation of this apparent contradiction\r\nhas been sought in the constitution of the plant itself. Hildebrand\r\nremarks that “certain species have a constitution which tends to early\r\nfructification. As soon as the seeds have been set, the strength of the\r\nplant is exhausted in the swelling of the grains, so that the plant\r\ndies.” “Other species, on the contrary, are so constituted that they\r\nvegetate for a long time, before fruiting, after which, however, they\r\nalso die. A third set of plants have such a constitution that “they\r\ndo not die after seeding, that they can seed often and live for many\r\nyears” (p. 113).\r\n\r\nBeing unable to indicate exactly the intrinsic mechanism of these\r\ndifferent “constitutions,” several botanists explain them by a kind of\r\nteleological predestination. According to Hildebrand “the nutritive\r\nprocesses of a plant have no other purpose than to make it capable of\r\nreproduction; this final end, however, can be reached in different\r\nmodes and after different periods of time” (p. 132). Goebel sets\r\ndown similar views. “In heterosporous plants the whole course of the\r\ndevelopment of prothalli is predetermined. The prothalli, so far as\r\nwe actually know, to use the phrase of theologians, are predestined;\r\ntheir fate is determined once for all” (p. 403). M. Massart[83]\r\nexpresses the same kind of view, when he says that “sometimes cells\r\ndie because their work is finished, and they have no longer any reason\r\nfor existing.”\r\n\r\nSuch an interpretation of the facts is quite opposed to determinism,\r\nand makes the problem of natural death in the plant world more\r\ndifficult but more interesting.\r\n\r\nThe modern scientific conception of the universe excludes the idea\r\nof predestination. The relations between fructification and natural\r\ndeath must be regulated by the law of selection, according to which no\r\norganism survives if its reproduction is impossible. It occasionally\r\nhappens that children are born without organs which are indispensable\r\nto life. Such monsters of different kinds being non-viable, cannot be\r\nsaid to be predestined to death, as they die because of defects in\r\ntheir structure. Others are born with all that is necessary for life,\r\nand survive for that reason, not because they are predestined to life.\r\nSo also species of plants which develop incompletely and which die\r\nbefore they have produced spores or seeds, cannot survive; whilst those\r\nwhich die after having given birth to the next generation survive in\r\ntheir descendants. However quickly death follow the production of seed,\r\nthe species will survive equally well. The cause of the natural death\r\nof plants must be sought, therefore, not in predestination, but in the\r\nmechanism of the organic processes.\r\n\r\nNothing seems more probable than that a plant should die when all its\r\norganic forces have been exhausted. It would be interesting, however,\r\nto ascertain the mechanism of that exhaustion, and this especially\r\nbecause it is often very difficult to imagine a cause for it. Many\r\nplants exist which produce several generations each season, in the same\r\nsoil, without exhausting it. In perennial plants, some parts, such\r\nas the flowers, die periodically, although the plant itself is not\r\nexhausted. Everyone has seen that in geraniums some of the flowers\r\nwither whilst others are blooming, the process going on throughout the\r\nseason. We can scarcely attribute such a natural death of the flowers\r\nto any exhaustion of the plant which continues to produce new flowers.\r\n\r\nThe fairly frequent prolongation of the life of plants is also\r\nout of harmony with the theory of natural death as the result of\r\nexhaustion. It sometimes happens that male plants produce female\r\nflowers abnormally; cases of this kind have been observed in willows,\r\nstinging-nettles, hops, and especially in maize.[84] Here we have\r\nto deal with a kind of monstrosity, differing, however, from the\r\nnon-viable monsters of the human race, in the respect that the\r\nproduction of female flowers on the male branches results in the\r\nprolongation of their lives. Generally the male branches die a natural\r\ndeath as soon as the pollen has been shed, and therefore some time\r\nbefore the death of the female flowers. If, however, a male branch\r\nbears a female flower which becomes fertilised, then the life of the\r\nbranch is prolonged until the seeds ripen. If the natural death of the\r\nmale flowers is the result of exhaustion due to the development of the\r\npollen, how can we reconcile this with the prolongation of life in a\r\ncase where the male branch has also female flowers to nourish and seeds\r\nto mature?\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that natural death, in such cases, is the result of a\r\nmechanism more complex than simple exhaustion.\r\n\r\nProf. de Vries has already noted that the duration of life in plants\r\ndepends on their vital processes. That view implies that there are some\r\nqualities inherent in its organisation which can prolong or shorten\r\nthe life of a plant, and it is here that we ought to find the key\r\nto the problem of natural death in the vegetable world. However, to\r\ngain exact knowledge of such factors, it would be necessary to have\r\ninformation on many points in plant physiology which unfortunately are\r\nvery imperfectly known. In this respect, the vital conditions of the\r\nsimplest plants, such as yeasts and bacteria, have been investigated\r\nmuch more fully. It is true that such low organisms reproduce freely\r\neither by division or by budding, so that they are amongst the\r\norganisms in which natural death is not inevitable. None the less, in\r\ntheir lives phenomena occasionally present themselves which can be\r\ninterpreted as cases of natural death.\r\n\r\nAt a time when it was still unknown that all fermentation was due\r\nto the action of microscopic plants, it had been observed that, in\r\ncertain conditions, fermentation ceased much more quickly than in\r\nother conditions. For instance, when sugar is being transformed to\r\nlactic acid, it is useful to add chalk, as otherwise the fermentation\r\nstops before the greater part of the sugar has been acted upon. When,\r\nin 1857, Pasteur made his great discovery of the lactic acid microbe,\r\nhe showed that that little organism, although it could produce lactic\r\nacid, was interfered with by an excess of the acid. To secure complete\r\nfermentation, it was necessary to neutralise the acid by the addition\r\nof chalk.\r\n\r\nWhen the action of lactic acid is continued too long, it not only\r\narrests the process of fermentation but definitely kills the microbe.\r\nIt is for that reason that it has been found difficult to preserve the\r\nlactic acid ferment for a long time in a living condition. Amongst the\r\nferments which have been isolated from Egyptian ‘leben’ by MM. Rist and\r\nKhoury[85] there is one which is extremely delicate.\r\n\r\nWhen it is inoculated deep in a nutritive medium, it dies in a few\r\ndays, death, without doubt, being due to the lactic acid produced by\r\nthe microbe from the sugar and not neutralised. As this transformation\r\nof sugar into lactic acid is a fundamental property of the microbe,\r\ndepending on its constitution, the arrest of the fermentation and the\r\ndeath of the ferment in these definite conditions can be interpreted\r\nonly as natural death due to auto-intoxication, that is to say to\r\npoisoning by a product of the physiological activity of the microbe\r\nitself. As death takes place at a time when the medium still contains\r\nenough sugar for the nutrition of the microbe, it is certain that\r\nit cannot be the result of exhaustion. This case of the lactic acid\r\nferment is not unique. The microbe which produces butyric acid is\r\nalso interfered with by the acid it secretes. M. G. Bertrand, who has\r\nexamined carefully the microbe which produces fermentation in sorbose\r\n(sugar extracted from fruit of the service-tree) (_Sorbus domestica_)\r\nhas informed me that this fermentation, too, ceases under the influence\r\nof the secretions of the microbes, and that the microbes undergo\r\nnatural death at a time when the medium is far from exhausted of the\r\nnutritive material. The yeast which produces alcohol is also interfered\r\nwith by an excess of alcohol, and as soon as a certain limit of\r\nalcoholic strength has been reached, fermentation stops. When the yeast\r\nis grown in media rich in nitrogen and poor in sugar, the plant takes\r\nthe nitrogenous material and produces salts of ammonia. These alkalies\r\ndamage the yeast and cause its death by auto-intoxication.[86]\r\n\r\nIn the examples that I have given, natural death was a result of\r\nthe activity of the microbes, and was in correlation with their\r\norganisation. Such death can be avoided by changing the external\r\nconditions, and, if the acids or alkalies produced by these bacteria\r\nare neutralised, the bacteria survive. The facts are in harmony with\r\nthose that I described in the case of the higher plants. By preventing\r\nthe ripening of seed, the life of many annual plants may be preserved\r\nand the plants changed to biennials or perennials. In such cases death,\r\nalthough the result of the constitution of the plant, may be postponed.\r\n\r\nWe may ask then if the natural death of higher plants, usually\r\nattributed to exhaustion, cannot be explained more simply as the\r\nresult of poisons produced in their metabolism. Many plants produce\r\npoisons which are fatal to animals and man. May they not also produce\r\nsubstances fatal to themselves? There is nothing improbable in the\r\nsupposition that some of the poisons may develop when the seeds are\r\nripening. By preventing the latter process, the ripening of the whole\r\norganism may also be prevented. Such a theory would explain the many\r\ncases of natural death which occur whilst the cell is far from having\r\nreached exhaustion. The equally numerous cases of partial death, such\r\nas that of flowers, whilst the same stem is still producing other\r\nflowers (_e.g._ geraniums) would be explained by a local action of the\r\npoisons not strong enough to kill the whole plant.\r\n\r\nI must insist that this theory, that natural death of the higher\r\nplants, is the result of auto-intoxication, is a mere hypothesis\r\nwhich future investigations may disprove. If, however, it comes to be\r\nconfirmed, it would explain the coincidence of death and fructification\r\nmore simply than the hypothesis of predestination.\r\n\r\nThe higher plants may be subjects of auto-intoxication in the same\r\nfashion as bacteria and yeasts. If these poisons were produced before\r\nthe ripening of the seeds, the plants would remain sterile, leaving\r\nno descendants, so that the race would become extinct. The production\r\nof poisons at the time of fructification would not interfere with the\r\nsuccession of generations, and the race would be preserved. As the\r\npoisoning is not necessary, it is easy to understand why many plants\r\nsurvive seeding and escape natural death. The Dragon-tree, baobab, and\r\nthe cedars, which I spoke of earlier, would be examples of such escape.\r\n\r\nAlthough the existence of auto-intoxication in the higher plants is\r\nstill only a hypothesis, the natural death of bacteria and yeasts by\r\npoisons which they themselves produce is an ascertained fact.\r\n\r\nIn the plant world, therefore, there are examples of natural death\r\n(bacteria and yeasts) due to auto-intoxication, and there are other\r\ncases where high or low plants escape natural death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nNATURAL DEATH IN THE ANIMAL WORLD\r\n\r\n  Different origins of natural death in animals—Examples\r\n  of natural death associated with violent acts—Examples\r\n  of natural death in animals without digestive\r\n  organs—Natural death in the two sexes—Hypothesis as to\r\n  the cause of natural death in animals\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cases of natural death amongst animals differ from those found in\r\nthe vegetable world by their greater variety and complexity. As M.\r\nMassart has shown for plants, so also natural death must have become\r\nestablished independently in different groups of animals. In some\r\ncases, the characters presented are strange and almost paradoxical.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to contrast natural death with violent death on account of\r\nthe difference between the two. None the less, natural death may occur\r\nin the animal kingdom, that is to say death resulting directly from the\r\nconstitution, and yet in intimate association with violent acts. I will\r\ngive some examples.\r\n\r\nSmall, helmet-shaped organisms, transparent and graceful, are common on\r\nthe surface of the sea. These have been described by zoologists under\r\nthe name _Pilidium_. The organisation is simple. The body wall is a\r\ndelicate pellicle, through which, on the lower surface, a mouth leads\r\ninto a capacious stomach. Continual movements of waving cilia direct\r\nsmall particles of food through the mouth to the digestive stomach.\r\nAs there are no organs of reproduction, it was assumed that these\r\ncreatures were not adults, but floating larvæ of some marine animal,\r\nand, after a good deal of trouble, it was found that the Pilidia were\r\nthe young stages of ribbon-shaped worms of the group of Nemertines.\r\nAt a definite stage in the life-history, a fœtus begins to develop\r\nround about the stomach of the Pilidium, and eventually completely\r\nencloses it and detaches it by violent muscular contractions. The end\r\nof the story is that the fœtus abandons the body of the Pilidium\r\ncarrying off with it the stomach, an organ necessary to the maintenance\r\nof life. The remnant of the Pilidium swims about in the sea-water, but\r\nsoon dies as the result of the mortal wound caused by the removal of\r\nthe digestive organs.\r\n\r\nThe act by which the Nemertine separates from its mother is violent,\r\nand yet the death of the Pilidium must be regarded as natural. It is\r\nthe result of agencies within the body and not, as in most cases of\r\naccidental death, of violence from without.\r\n\r\nThe group of Nematode worms contains many common intestinal parasites\r\nof man, such as _Ascaris_, _Trichina_, _Trichocephalus_, _Oxyuris_,\r\n&c., but also others that live free in soil or water or in such fluids\r\nas vinegar. They are protected by a strong cuticle, and some of them\r\nare viviparous, that is to say, instead of laying eggs they give\r\nbirth to young worms already well grown and capable of independent\r\nactivity. Amongst the human Nematode parasites, the _Trichinæ_ give\r\nbirth to swarms of small larvæ which easily escape from the body of\r\nthe mother by the female generative aperture. In the case of some\r\nfree-living Nematodes, however, the female aperture is too small to\r\ngive passage to the rather stout larvæ. More than forty years ago, when\r\nI was investigating the life-history[87] of one of these Nematodes\r\n(_Diplogaster tridentatus_) I was struck by the fact that the larvæ\r\ncould leave the body of the mother only by violence and after they had\r\ndevoured most of its substance. These larvæ develop from eggs produced\r\nwithin the maternal body. As the external reproductive aperture of\r\nthe female is minute, the larvæ cannot escape through it, but wander\r\namongst the tissues tearing and absorbing them. The mother soon dies,\r\nand although her death is violent, it must be included in the category\r\nof natural death.\r\n\r\nFrom the teleological point of view it might be said that Pilidium\r\nand Diplogaster cease to live because they have fulfilled their\r\nfunction of giving rise to a Nemertine or young Nematodes. Their\r\nnatural death would thus be predestined. There is no ground for such\r\nan interpretation. On the other hand, it is certain that this death,\r\ncoming after the birth of the new generation, is in no way against the\r\npreservation of the species in which the extraordinary natural death\r\nby violence occurs. If the female orifice of Diplogaster were slightly\r\nlarger, the larvæ would emerge without difficulty and without causing\r\nthe death of the mother which none the less would have fulfilled her\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nAll the cases of natural death amongst animals are not so brutal as\r\nthose of the Pilidium and the Nemertine worms. In many instances the\r\ndeath is peaceful. As very frequently it is difficult to establish\r\ndefinitely that the death is natural, I shall select clear cases.\r\n\r\nAnimals are occasionally found which are devoid of some organ necessary\r\nfor prolonged life. The absence of a digestive tract in an animal that\r\nlives in an environment rich in dissolved nutritive material (as for\r\ninstance tapeworms living in the intestinal tract) is not surprising.\r\nBut when creatures of the sea or of fresh water have no digestive\r\ntract, their life can be maintained only at the expense of nutritive\r\nmaterial stored within them during embryonic life. The death which\r\ncomes eventually is truly natural. The best cases, that is to say those\r\nwhich can be studied most completely, of such natural death occur\r\namongst the Rotifera. These are minute creatures of fresh or sea water,\r\nat one time confused with the Infusoria, but possessed of a much more\r\ncomplex organisation. They have a well-developed digestive tube, organs\r\nof excretion, nervous system, and organs of sense. The animals are\r\ndiœcious; in each species both males and females exist. Whilst the\r\nfemales have the complete structure of the species, the males are much\r\nreduced, and are devoid of a digestive canal. The cuticle is fairly\r\nstout, and they are unable to absorb dissolved nutriment through it; as\r\nthey have no organs of digestion, their life must be short.\r\n\r\nTo study in detail the life and death of these creatures, I selected a\r\nspecies sent to me by M. Haffkine. So far as I can judge, the species\r\nin question is a hitherto unknown member of the genus _Pleurotrocha_,\r\nand I propose for it the name _Pleurotrocha haffkini_. This rotifer is\r\nconvenient to study as it thrives in vessels containing fresh-water to\r\nwhich some bread-crumb has been added (in the proportion of a gram of\r\nbread to 500 grams of water).\r\n\r\nThe sexes of the little rotifer can be distinguished from the earliest\r\nage, for eggs that are to become females are much larger than those\r\nfrom which males develop. It is easy to isolate the male eggs and to\r\nfollow the life-history up to the moment of natural death. The whole\r\ncourse of life from the laying of the egg until death lasts only about\r\nthree days, and is probably the shortest duration of life in the animal\r\nkingdom. Although some Ephemeridæ live only a few hours in the adult\r\nstate, their total life-cycle is much longer than that of the rotifers,\r\nas the larval stages last for months or even for years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Male _Pleurotrocha haffkini_.]\r\n\r\nThe little males (Fig. 16) begin to swim soon after hatching, the\r\nwheel-apparatus and the musculature being vigorous. They seek out\r\nthe females, as their reproductive organs are mature almost at the\r\nmoment of hatching. The transparent body, which is devoid of digestive\r\napparatus, swarms with mobile spermatozoa. As soon as the male has\r\nseized a female, he discharges the contents of his body. It might be\r\nsupposed that such an evacuation would cause a violent perturbation of\r\nthe system leading to the death of the organism. There is no question\r\nof this however. The males are able to live for twenty-four hours after\r\nhaving accomplished their function, and the period represents a third\r\nof their total duration of life. Moreover, I have isolated males from\r\nfemales without any prolongation of their lives. In one experiment, I\r\nisolated two males and placed a third in company with two females. It\r\nwas the third specimen that lived longest.\r\n\r\nThe natural death of the males is foreshadowed by a weakening of the\r\nmovements; although the muscles and cilia remain mobile, the whole\r\nanimal moves only spasmodically; sometimes the muscles of the head\r\ncontract, sometimes those of the tail, but no locomotion occurs.\r\nOccasionally there is a violent effort of ciliary motion as if the\r\nattempt were being made to overcome the immobility of the body. Such\r\na condition lasts for several hours and is followed by death. The\r\nspermatozoa inside the body retain activity last of all.\r\n\r\nTowards the crisis, bacteria, which abound in the medium occupied by\r\nthe rotifers, begin to attack the males. Some cluster round the head,\r\nothers round the tail, although none of them can effect entrance to\r\nthe body. The death of the males cannot be attributed to microbial\r\ninfection, but comes from some intrinsic cause.\r\n\r\nIs it inanition that is the cause of death? I do not think so, because\r\nup to the time of death the tissues appear to be unmodified. In the\r\ncase of the females I have sometimes seen phenomena of inanition. In\r\nold and exhausted cultures the starved females become thin, flattened\r\nand quite transparent, and the tissues lose their granular appearance.\r\nNo such changes are visible in the dying males, the tissues of which,\r\non the contrary, retain a normal aspect.\r\n\r\nThe most probable explanation is that death comes from poisoning by the\r\nsecretions of the tissues themselves. The large size of the organs of\r\nexcretion indicates that in the course of metabolism waste matter is\r\nproduced some of which is got rid of. If, after a time, the secretions\r\nare insufficiently eliminated, the tissues must be poisoned. As death\r\nis preceded by a spasm of uncoordinated movement, it appears as if the\r\nfatal intoxication of the males affected the nervous system first. The\r\nvibrating cilia and the muscles are attacked later.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that the death of these male rotifers is\r\nnatural in the fullest sense. The females, however, although they are\r\nprovided with complete digestive organs, do not escape a similar fate.\r\nTheir life is longer and more complex than that of the males, and so\r\nis subject to many more chances. The females therefore may come to die\r\nfrom starvation or from other external, accidental causes. But, if they\r\nare kept in favourable conditions, they may live for about fifteen\r\ndays, towards the end of which they die naturally, exhibiting the\r\nsymptoms that I have described in the case of the males (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—Female _Pleurtrocha haffkini_, which has died\r\na natural death.]\r\n\r\nRotifers are not the only animals which undergo natural death in a\r\nfashion quite unlike the violent end of Pilidium and Diplogaster. There\r\nare other cases amongst invertebrates, but I shall limit myself to\r\ndescribing one that is well ascertained.\r\n\r\nMore than fifty years ago, Dana, the American naturalist, discovered a\r\npelagic marine creature with characters so curious that he gave to it\r\nthe name _Monstrilla_. It is a little crustacean akin to the _Cyclops_\r\nof lakes. But although the latter is endowed with the organs necessary\r\nto capture and digest food, _Monstrilla_ has neither organs of\r\nprehension nor a digestive canal. It is a highly muscular animal with\r\norgans of sense and reproduction and a nervous system; but it is devoid\r\nof apparatus for prolonging life by nutrition. _Monstrilla_ therefore\r\nis a creature doomed to natural death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—_Monstrilla._ (After M. Malaquin.)]\r\n\r\nThe detailed observations of M. Malaquin[88] have supplied full\r\ninformation regarding this strange life-history. _Monstrilla_ passes\r\na portion of its life as a parasite on Annelid worms. In that stage\r\nit accumulates the necessary material for the growth of the sexual\r\nproducts (ova and spermatozoa) and for free life in the sea whilst the\r\nyoung are developing. It is not only the males which have no digestive\r\napparatus. The females also lack it, which is the more surprising as\r\nthey carry about the eggs attached to the body (as is done by many\r\nother Crustacea, such as crayfish and lobsters) until the young are\r\nready to hatch (Fig. 18). M. Malaquin thinks that the Monstrillas die\r\nof starvation.\r\n\r\n“As they are without a digestive tube or organs of prehension or\r\nmastication,” M. Malaquin says (p. 192), “the Monstrillas, which have\r\nno means of nutrition, are doomed to death from inanition after a short\r\npelagic life. This is a logical inference from their structure.”\r\n\r\nIn support of his view, M. Malaquin states that before death the\r\ntissues and organs show plain signs of degeneration.\r\n\r\n“The eyes first show traces of degeneration. The pigment spreads and\r\ndisappears little by little and then the visual elements fade out.”\r\n\r\n“Finally, individuals, usually females, show complete degeneration.\r\nA female taken in a fine-meshed net showed no trace of organs in the\r\nhead; the eyes, the brain and the intestinal tract had disappeared\r\nalmost completely. The antennæ were reduced to stumps consisting of the\r\nlowest joint and a portion of the second. These were clear indications\r\nof the senility that precedes death” (p. 194).\r\n\r\nSuch evidence not only supports the hypothesis that the natural\r\ndeath of Monstrilla is due to inanition, but is opposed to a similar\r\ninterpretation being applied to the case of male rotifers, in which\r\ndeath is not preceded by wasting of the organs. The death of some\r\ninsects, which comes rapidly after the adult stage has been reached,\r\ncannot readily be attributed to starvation. In the strange butterflies\r\nknown as psychids (_Solenobia_) some of the females lay eggs without\r\nhaving been fertilised,[89] and their life in the adult condition lasts\r\nonly a day. On the other hand, other females of the same butterfly\r\nare fertilised before laying their eggs and in this case survive for\r\nmore than a week although they take no food. The rapid death of the\r\nfirst-mentioned set cannot be attributed to inanition.\r\n\r\nIn some Ephemeridæ, which supply good cases of natural death, the end\r\ncomes after a few hours of adult life without any sign of degeneration\r\nof the organs. As in others (_Chloë_), life lasts for several days\r\nwithout food having been taken, it is clear that inanition is not\r\nthe cause of the swift arrival of death in the first set. It is much\r\nmore probable that the natural death is due to an auto-intoxication\r\nwhich takes effect at different intervals of time in different\r\ncircumstances.[90]\r\n\r\nIn the higher animals such as vertebrates the conditions are less\r\nfavourable than in the case of insects for the investigation of the\r\ncauses of natural death. Vertebrates have always well-developed organs\r\nof digestion and so live a relatively longer time and encounter a\r\ngreater number of chances of accident, with the result that in most\r\ncases death comes from external accidental causes. Vertebrates usually\r\nperish from hunger or cold, or are devoured by their enemies or killed\r\nby the attacks of parasites or diseases. There remains only the human\r\nrace amongst the more highly developed animals, in which to study\r\nthe onset of natural death. And in the human race cases which may be\r\ndesignated as natural are extremely rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNATURAL DEATH AMONGST HUMAN BEINGS\r\n\r\n  Natural death in the aged—Analogy of natural death and\r\n  sleep—Theories of sleep—_Ponogenes_—The instinct\r\n  of sleep—The instinct of natural death—Replies to\r\n  critics—Agreeable sensation at the approach of death\r\n\r\n\r\nThe death of old people, which has often been described as natural\r\ndeath, is in most cases due to infectious diseases, particularly\r\npneumonia (which is extremely dangerous) or to attacks of apoplexy.\r\nTrue natural death must be very rare in the human race. Demange[91]\r\nhas described it as follows:—“Arrived at extreme old age, and still\r\npreserving the last flickers of an expiring intelligence, the old man\r\nfeels weakness gaining on him from day to day. His limbs refuse to obey\r\nhis will, the skin becomes insensitive, dry, and cold; the extremities\r\nlose their warmth; the face is thin; the eyes hollow and the sight\r\nweak; speech dies out on his lips which remain open; life quits the\r\nold man from the circumference towards the centre; breathing grows\r\nlaboured, and at last the heart stops beating. The old man passes away\r\nquietly, seeming to fall asleep for the last time.” Such is the course\r\nof what properly speaking is natural death.\r\n\r\nThe natural death of human beings cannot be regarded as due to\r\nexhaustion from reproduction or from inanition, as in the case\r\nof _Monstrilla_. It is much more likely that it is due to an\r\nauto-intoxication of the organism. The close analogy between natural\r\ndeath and sleep supports this view, as it is very probable that sleep\r\nis due to poisoning by the products of organic activity.\r\n\r\nIt is more than fifty years since sleep was explained as the result\r\nof auto-intoxication. Obersteiner, Binz, Preyer, and Errera are among\r\nthe competent men of science who have taken this view. The first two\r\nattributed sleep to an accumulation in the brain of the products of\r\nexhaustion which are carried away by the blood during repose. The\r\nattempt has been made even to discover the nature of these narcotic\r\nsubstances. Some investigators think that an acid, produced during\r\nthe activity of the organs, is stored up in quantities that cannot be\r\ntolerated. During sleep, the organism gets rid of this excess of acid.\r\n\r\nPreyer[92] tried to put the problem upon a more exact basis by the\r\ntheory that the activity of all the organs gives rise to substances\r\nwhich he called _ponogenes_ and which he regarded as producing the\r\nsensation of fatigue. According to him these substances accumulate\r\nduring the waking hours, and are destroyed by oxidation during sleep.\r\nPreyer thinks that lactic acid is the most important of the ponogenes,\r\nand lays stress on its narcotic effect. If his theory were correct,\r\nthere would be a remarkable analogy between the auto-intoxication by\r\nlactic acid in the cases of man and animals, and the case of bacteria\r\nwhich produce the same acid and the fermenting activity of which is\r\narrested as the acid accumulates. Just as sleep may be transformed\r\nto natural death, so also the arrest of lactic fermentation may be\r\nfollowed by the death of the bacteria which form the acid.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, there has been no confirmation of Preyer’s theory.\r\nErrera[93] has brought forward against it another theory according\r\nto which the cause of sleep is not acid products, but certain\r\nalkaline substances described by M. Armand Gautier under the name of\r\n_leucomaines_. Gautier laid down that these substances act on the\r\nnervous centres and produce fatigue and sleepiness. According to Errera\r\nthey might very well be the cause of sleep, as that comes on at a\r\ntime when there is the greatest accumulation of these leucomaines in\r\nthe body. He thinks that their action in producing sleep is a direct\r\nintoxication of the nerve centres. During sleep they are removed, and\r\nthe disturbance which was produced in the organism is arrested.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to accept Errera’s theory, a kind of analogy could\r\nbe established between sleep and natural death on the one hand, and\r\nthe arrest of development and death of yeast grown in nitrogenous\r\nmedia on the other hand, because in the latter case the poisoning is\r\nproduced by an alkaline salt of ammonia. It must be confessed, however,\r\nthat the actual state of our knowledge does not allow of a definite\r\nview of the real mechanism of the sleep-producing intoxication. Our\r\nideas regarding leucomaines in general are still incomplete, and,\r\nrecently, one of them, _adrenaline_, the product of the supra-renal\r\ncapsules, has been investigated. Adrenaline is an alkaloid[94] which is\r\nproduced in the supra-renal bodies and is discharged into the blood.\r\nIt has the power of contracting arteries strongly, and has been used\r\nto control blood-pressure. When it is given in large quantities or\r\nin frequent doses, it acts as a true poison, whilst, in small doses,\r\nit produces anæmia of the organs and has a special influence on the\r\nnervous centres. Dr. Zeigan[95] has shown that a milligramme of\r\nadrenaline, mixed with five grammes of normal salt solution injected\r\ninto the brain of cats, produces a soporific action. “About a minute\r\nafter the injection, the animal appears to be plunged into deep sleep\r\nwhich lasts from 30 to 50 minutes. During this time, the sensitiveness\r\nof the animal has completely ceased throughout the body, and for some\r\ntime after that it is much decreased. When they awake the animals\r\nseem to have been drunk with sleep for some time.” Sleep is generally\r\nassociated with anæmia of the brain, and as adrenaline can actually\r\nproduce such anæmia, it might be supposed that this narcotic substance\r\nis the most important of the organic products which give rise to sleep.\r\nAgainst this hypothesis, however, some weight must be given to recent\r\ninvestigations on fatigue and its causes.\r\n\r\nEach stage in the advance of knowledge has had its influence on\r\nthe study of the interesting and complex problem of sleep. When it\r\nwas thought that alkaloids (ptomaines) were of great importance in\r\ninfectious diseases, it was attempted to explain sleep as due to the\r\naction of similar bodies. Now, when we believe that in such diseases\r\nthe chief part is played by poisons of extremely complex chemical\r\ncomposition, the attempt is made to explain fatigue and sleep by\r\nsimilar bodies.\r\n\r\nWeichardt[96] has recently made the best known investigations in this\r\ndirection. This young man maintains with ardour the view that during\r\nthe activity of organs there is an accumulation of special materials\r\nwhich are neither organic acids nor leucomaines, but which are much\r\nmore like the toxic products of pathogenic bacteria.\r\n\r\nWeichardt made animals in his laboratory go through fatiguing\r\nmovements for hours and then killed them. The extract from muscles of\r\nsuch animals had a powerful toxic effect when it was injected into\r\nnormal animals, producing lassitude and sometimes death within 20 to\r\n40 hours. As all attempts to determine the exact chemical nature of\r\nthis fatigue-producing substance were baffled, it is impossible to get\r\nan exact account of it. Amongst its properties there is one of great\r\ninterest. When it has passed into the circulation of normal animals in\r\nquantities insufficient to produce death, it excites the formation of\r\nan anti-toxin in the same way as a poison of diphtheria stimulates the\r\nproduction of a diphtheria anti-toxin.\r\n\r\nWhen Weichardt injected into animals a mixture of the poison which\r\nproduces fatigue with small doses of the serum antidote, no results\r\nfollowed. The neutralising effect of the antidote was apparent\r\neven when it was introduced by the mouth. Towards the end of his\r\ninvestigations, Weichardt supposed that it would be possible to obtain\r\na material that would prevent fatigue.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is still impossible to specify exactly the nature of the\r\nsubstances which accumulate during the activity of organs and which\r\nproduce fatigue and sleep, it is becoming more and more probable that\r\nsuch substances exist, and that sleep is really an auto-intoxication\r\nof the organism. So far, such a theory has not been shaken by any\r\nargument. Recently M. E. Claparède,[97] a psychologist of Geneva,\r\nhas argued against the current theory of sleep. He thinks that it\r\nis contradicted by the fact that new-born infants sleep a great\r\ndeal, whilst very old people sleep very little. This fact, however,\r\ncan readily be explained by the greater sensibility of the nerve\r\ncentres of infants, as shown with regard to many harmful agencies. The\r\nother objections of Claparède, such as the fact that sleepiness is\r\ninduced by exercise in the open air, or that excess of sleep itself\r\nproduces sleepiness, are not really incompatible with the theory of\r\nauto-intoxication. They are facts of secondary importance probably\r\ndepending on some complication which the present state of our knowledge\r\nmakes it difficult to indicate exactly. The insomnia of neurasthenia,\r\nwhich Claparède brings forward as another objection, can readily be\r\nexplained as due to hyperæsthesia of the nervous tissues which lose\r\npart of their sensitiveness to poisons.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are many well established facts in agreement\r\nwith the theory of auto-intoxication. Leaving out of the question\r\nsleep induced by narcotics, I may mention in this connection the\r\nso-called “sleeping sickness.” It has been proved that this disease\r\nis caused by a microscopic parasite, the _Trypanosoma gambiense_ of\r\nDutton, which develops in the blood and spreads to the liquid of the\r\nmembranes surrounding the central nervous system. One of the most\r\ntypical symptoms of the advanced stages of this disease is continual\r\ndrowsiness. “The drowsiness increases progressively, and the habitual\r\nattitude becomes characteristic; the head is bent on the breast; the\r\neyelids are closed; in earlier stages the invalid can be aroused\r\neasily, but, after a time, incurable attacks of sleep overcome the\r\npatient in all circumstances, but especially after meals. These\r\nfits of sleepiness become longer and deeper, until they reach a\r\ncomatose condition from which it is almost impossible to arouse the\r\npatient.”[98] The total result of medical knowledge of this disease\r\nis that it is impossible to doubt that the sleepiness is due to\r\nintoxication produced by the poison of the trypanosome.\r\n\r\nClaparède has opposed what he calls an “instinctive” theory to\r\nthe toxic theory of sleep. According to this theory, sleep is the\r\nmanifestation of an instinct “the object of which is to arrest\r\nactivity; we do not sleep because we are intoxicated or exhausted, but\r\nto prevent ourselves from falling into such a condition.” However, in\r\norder to bring this narcotic instinct into play, certain conditions\r\nare necessary, one of which certainly would be the intoxication of\r\nthe nerve centres. M. Claparède supposes that sleep is an active\r\nphenomenon, induced when waste matter begins to accumulate in the\r\norganism. “To bring about sleep, the nerve centres must be influenced\r\nby waste matter, and this influence can readily be regarded as a kind\r\nof intoxication.”\r\n\r\nHunger is an instinctive sensation as much as sleepiness, but it does\r\nnot appear until our tissues are in a condition of exhaustion, the\r\nexact nature of which cannot as yet be indicated. There is no real\r\ncontradiction between the toxic and instinctive theories of sleep. The\r\ntwo theories represent different sides of a special condition of the\r\norganism.\r\n\r\nThe analogy between sleep and natural death is in favour of the\r\nsupposition that the latter, also, is due to an intoxication much more\r\nprofound and serious than that which results in sleep. Therefore, as\r\nnatural death in human beings has been studied only very superficially,\r\nit is impossible to do more than frame theories regarding it.\r\n\r\nIt would be natural if, just as in sleep there is an instinctive\r\ndesire for rest, so also the natural death of man were preceded by an\r\ninstinctive wish for it. As I have already discussed this subject in\r\nthe “Nature of Man” (chap. xi) I need not deal with it at length here.\r\nI should like, however, to add some information which I have recently\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThe most striking fact in favour of the existence of the instinct for\r\nnatural death in man appears to me to have been related by Tokarsky\r\nin regard to an old woman. While Tokarsky was alive I asked one of\r\nhis friends to obtain for me further details of this very interesting\r\ncase. Unfortunately Tokarsky could add nothing to what he had already\r\npublished in his article. I think that I have discovered the source of\r\nhis information. In his famous book on the _Physiology of Taste_[99]\r\nBrillat-Savarin relates as follows:—“A great-aunt of mine died at\r\nthe age of 93. Although she had been confined to bed for some time\r\nher faculties were still well preserved, and the only evidence of her\r\ncondition was the decrease in appetite and weakening of her voice.\r\nShe had always been very friendly to me, and once when I was at her\r\nbedside, ready to tend her affectionately, although that did not\r\nhinder me from seeing her with the philosophical eye that I always\r\nturned on everything about me, ‘Is it you, my nephew?’ she said in\r\nher feeble voice. ‘Yes, Aunt, I am here at your service, and I think\r\nyou will do very well to take a drop of this good old wine.’ ‘Give it\r\nme, my dear; I can always take a little wine.’ I made ready at once,\r\nand gently supporting her, gave her half a glass of my best wine. She\r\nbrightened up at once, and turning on me her eyes which used to be so\r\nbeautiful, said: ‘Thank you very much for this last kindness; if you\r\never reach my age you will find that one wants to die just as one wants\r\nto sleep.’ These were her last words, and in half an hour she fell into\r\nher last sleep.” The details make it certain that this was a case of\r\nthe instinct of natural death. The instinct showed itself at an age\r\nnot very great in the case of a woman who had preserved her mental\r\nfaculties. Generally, however, it seems not to appear till much later,\r\nfor old men usually exhibit a keen wish to live.\r\n\r\nIt is a well-known saying that the longer a man has lived the more\r\nhe wishes to live. Charles Renouvier,[100] a French philosopher who\r\ndied a few years ago, has left a definite proof of the truth of the\r\nsaying. When he was eighty-eight years old, and knew that he was\r\ndying, he recorded his impressions in his last days. Let me quote from\r\nwhat he wrote four days before his death. “I have no illusions about\r\nmy condition; I know quite well that I am going to die, perhaps in a\r\nweek, perhaps in a fortnight. And I have still so much to say on my\r\nsubject.” “At my age I have no longer the right to hope: my days are\r\nnumbered, and perhaps my hours. I must resign myself.” “I do not die\r\nwithout regrets. I regret that I cannot foresee in any way the fate\r\nof my views.” “And I am leaving the world before I have said my last\r\nword. A man always dies before he has finished his work, and that\r\nis the saddest of the sorrows of life.” “But that is not the whole\r\ntrouble, when a man is old, very old, and accustomed to life, it is\r\nvery difficult to die. I think that young men accept the idea of dying\r\nmore easily, perhaps more willingly than old men. When one is more\r\nthan eighty years old, one is cowardly and shrinks from death. And\r\nwhen one knows and can no longer doubt that death is coming near, deep\r\nbitterness falls on the soul.” “I have faced the question from all\r\nsides in the last few days; I turn the one idea over in my mind; I\r\n_know_ that I am going to die, but I cannot _persuade_ myself that I\r\nam going to die. It is not the philosopher in me that protests. The\r\nphilosopher does not fear death; it is the _old man_. The old man has\r\nnot the courage to submit, and yet I have to submit to the inevitable.”\r\n\r\nI know a lady, a hundred and two years old, who is so oppressed by\r\nthe idea of death, that those about her have to conceal from her the\r\ndeath of any of her acquaintances. Mde. Robineau, however, when between\r\none hundred and four and one hundred and five years old, became quite\r\nindifferent to the close approach of her own death. She often expressed\r\na wish for it, thinking herself useless in the world.\r\n\r\nM. Yves Delage[101] in an analysis of my “Nature of Man” doubted the\r\nexistence of an instinct for death. “Animals,” said he, “cannot have\r\nthe instinct for death, because they do not know of death. In their\r\ncase, we must consider that what happens is an apathy tending to the\r\nabolition of the sense of self-preservation. In man, the knowledge\r\nof death implies that the indifference to its approach cannot be an\r\ninstinct.” “There may be developed, at the end of life, a special state\r\nof mind which accepts death with indifference or with pleasure, but\r\nsuch a state cannot be designated as an instinct.” M. Delage, however,\r\ndoes not suggest what the state of mind in question is to be called.\r\nAs the aunt of Brillat-Savarin compared her sensations just before\r\ndeath with the desire to sleep, and as this desire is an instinctive\r\nmanifestation, I think that the cheerful acquiescence in death,\r\nexhibited by extremely old people, is also a kind of instinct. However,\r\nthe important matter is that the sentiment exists, and not what we are\r\nto call it. M. Delage is far from denying its existence.\r\n\r\nDr. Cancalon,[102] another of my critics, cannot admit the existence\r\nof an instinct of death, “because of the theory of evolution. Of what\r\ngood would it have been, as M. Metchnikoff tells us that natural death\r\nis very rare; how could it have been transmitted, as it comes into\r\nexistence long after the age of reproduction, and how could it have\r\naided the survival of the species? If its existence were proved as\r\nthe result of biological evolution, it would be a contradiction of\r\nadaptation and an argument in favour of final causes.” I cannot agree\r\nin any way with these opinions. In the first place, it is well known\r\nthat men and animals have many harmful instincts that do not tend\r\nto the survival of the species. I need recall only the disharmonic\r\ninstincts which I described in the “Nature of Man,” such as the\r\nanomalies of the sexual instinct, the instinct which drives parents to\r\ndevour their young or which attracts insects to flames. The instinct\r\nof natural death is far from being harmful, and may even have many\r\nadvantages. If men were convinced that the end of life were natural\r\ndeath accompanied by a special instinct like that of the need for\r\nsleep, one of the greatest sources of pessimism would disappear. Now\r\npessimism is the cause of the voluntary death of a certain number of\r\npeople and of many others refraining from reproduction. The instinct\r\nof natural death would contribute to the maintenance of the life of\r\nthe individual and of the species. On the other hand, there is no\r\ndifficulty in admitting the existence of instincts hostile to the\r\npreservation of the species, especially in the case of man, in whom\r\nindividualism has reached its highest development. As man is the only\r\nanimal with a definite notion of death, there is nothing extraordinary\r\nif it is in man that the instinctive wish for death develops. M.\r\nCancalon denies the possibility that death can be pleasant, as it is\r\nthe arrest of the physiological functions; but as sleep and syncope\r\nare often preceded by very pleasant sensations, why may not this also\r\nhappen in natural death? Several facts prove it beyond dispute. It is\r\neven probable that the approach of natural death is one of the most\r\npleasant sensations that can exist.\r\n\r\nIt is indubitable that in a large number of cases of death, the\r\ncessation of life is associated with very painful sensations. One has\r\nonly to see the horror shown in the faces o£ many dying people to be\r\nconvinced of this, but there are diseases and serious accidents in\r\nwhich the approach of death does not arouse sorrowful sensations. I\r\nmyself, in a crisis of intermittent fever, in which the temperature\r\ndescended in a very short time from about 106° Fahr. to below normal,\r\nexperienced a feeling of extraordinary weakness, certainly like that\r\nat the approach of death. This sensation was much more pleasant than\r\npainful. In two cases of serious morphia poisoning, my sensations were\r\nmore agreeable; I felt a pleasant weakness, associated with a sensation\r\nof lightness of the body, as if I were floating in the air.\r\n\r\nThose who have noted the sensations of persons rescued from death have\r\nrelated similar facts. Prof. Heim, of Zurich, has described a fall\r\nin the mountains which nearly killed him, as well as several similar\r\naccidents to Alpine tourists. In all these cases he states that there\r\nwas a sensation of pleasure.[103] Dr. Sollier has told of a young woman\r\naddicted to morphia, who had been convinced that she was at the point\r\nof death. On recovering from a most serious attack of syncope, from\r\nwhich she was restored only by giving another dose of morphia, she\r\ncried: “I seem to come from far away; how happy I was!” Another of\r\nDr. Sollier’s patients, a lady who had an attack of peritonitis from\r\nwhich she expected to die, felt herself “suffused with a feeling of\r\nwell-being, or rather the absence of all pain.” In a third Case of Dr.\r\nSollier, a young woman suffering from puerperal fever, feeling herself\r\nat the point of death, had a similar sensation “of physical well-being\r\nand of detachment from everything.”[104]\r\n\r\nAs a sensation of happiness occurs even in cases of pathological death,\r\nit is much more likely to occur in natural death. If natural death be\r\npreceded by the loss of the instinct of life and by the acquisition of\r\na new instinct, it would be the best possible end compatible with the\r\nreal organisation of human nature.\r\n\r\nI do not pretend to give the reader a finished study on natural death.\r\nThis chapter of Thanatology, the science of death, only opens the\r\nsubject; but it is already apparent that study of the circumstances of\r\nnatural death in plants, in the animal world, and in human beings, may\r\ngive facts of the highest interest to science and humanity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nSHOULD WE TRY TO PROLONG HUMAN LIFE?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE BENEFIT TO HUMANITY\r\n\r\n  Complaints of the shortness of our life—Theory of\r\n  “medical selection” as a cause of degeneration of the\r\n  race—Utility of prolonging human life\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the duration of the life of man is one of the longest amongst\r\nmammals, men find it too short. From the remotest times the shortness\r\nof life has been complained of, and there have been many attempts to\r\nprolong it. Man has not been satisfied with a duration of life notably\r\ngreater than that of his nearest relatives, and has wished to live at\r\nleast as long as reptiles.\r\n\r\nIn antiquity, Hippocrates and Aristotle thought that human life was too\r\nshort, and Theophrastus, although he died at an advanced age (he lived\r\nprobably seventy-five years) lamented when he was dying “that nature\r\nhad given to deer and to crows a life so long and so useless, and to\r\nman only one that was often very short.”[105]\r\n\r\nSeneca (_De brevitate vitæ_) and later, in the 18th century, Haller,\r\nstrove in vain against such complaints, which have lasted until our own\r\ndays. Whilst animals have no more than an instinctive fear of danger,\r\nand cling to life without knowing what death is, men have acquired an\r\nexact idea of death, and their knowledge increases their desire to live.\r\n\r\nOught we to listen to the cry of humanity that life is too short and\r\nthat it would be well to prolong it? Would it really be for the good\r\nof the human race to extend the duration of the life of man beyond its\r\npresent limits? Already it is complained that the burden of supporting\r\nold people is too heavy, and statesmen are perturbed by the enormous\r\nexpense which will be entailed by State support of the aged. In\r\nFrance, in a population of about 38 millions, there are two millions\r\n(1,912,153) who have reached the age of 70, that is to say, about five\r\nper cent. of the total. The support of these old people absorbs a\r\nsum of nearly £6,000,000 per annum.[106] However generous may be the\r\nviews of the members of the French Parliament, many of them hesitate\r\nat the idea of so great a burden. Without doubt, men say, the cost of\r\nmaintaining the aged will become still heavier if the duration of life\r\nis to be prolonged. If old people are to live longer, the resources of\r\nthe young will be reduced.\r\n\r\nIf the question were merely one of prolonging the life of old people\r\nwithout modifying old age itself, such considerations would be\r\njustified. It must be understood, however, that the prolongation of\r\nlife would be associated with the preservation of intelligence and\r\nof the power to work. In the earlier parts of this book I have given\r\nmany examples which show the possibility of useful work being done\r\nby persons of advanced years. When we have reduced or abolished such\r\ncauses of precocious senility as intemperance and disease, it will no\r\nlonger be necessary to give pensions at the age of sixty or seventy\r\nyears. The cost of supporting the old, instead of increasing, will\r\ndiminish progressively.\r\n\r\nIf attainment of the normal duration of life, which is much greater\r\nthan the average life to-day, were to overpopulate the earth, a very\r\nremote possibility, this could be remedied by lowering the birth-rate.\r\nEven at the present time, while the earth is far from being too quickly\r\npeopled, artificial limitation of the birth-rate takes place perhaps to\r\nan unnecessary extent.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a charge against medicine and hygiene that they tend\r\nto weaken the human race. By scientific means unhealthy people, or\r\nthose with inherited blemishes, have been preserved so that they can\r\ngive birth to weak offspring. If natural selection were allowed free\r\nplay, such individuals would perish and make room for others, stronger\r\nand better able to live. Haeckel has given the name “medical selection”\r\nto this process under which humanity degenerates because of the\r\ninfluence of medical science.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that a valuable existence of great service to humanity is\r\ncompatible with a feeble constitution and precarious health. Amongst\r\ntuberculous people, those with inherited or acquired syphilis, and\r\nthose with a constitution unbalanced in other ways, that is to say,\r\namongst so-called degenerates, there have been individuals who have had\r\na large share in the advance of the human race. I need only instance\r\nthe names of Fresnel, Leopardi, Weber, Schumann and Chopin. It does\r\nnot follow that we ought to cherish diseases and leave to natural\r\nselection the duty of preserving the individuals which can resist them.\r\nOn the other hand, it is indispensable to try to blot out the diseases\r\nthemselves, and, in particular, the evils of old age, by the methods\r\nof hygiene and therapeutics. The theory of medical selection must be\r\ngiven up as contrary to the good of the human race. We must use all\r\nour endeavours to allow men to complete their normal course of life,\r\nand to make it possible for old men to play their parts as advisers and\r\njudges, endowed with their long experience of life.\r\n\r\nTo the question propounded at the beginning of this section of my book,\r\nI can make only one answer: Yes, it is useful to prolong human life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE PROLONGATION OF LIFE\r\n\r\n  Ancient methods of prolonging human life—Gerokomy—The\r\n  “immortality draught” of the Taoists—Brown-Séquard’s\r\n  method—The spermine of Poehl—Dr. Weber’s\r\n  precepts—Increased duration of life in historical\r\n  times—Hygienic maxims—Decrease in cutaneous cancer\r\n\r\n\r\nMen of all times have attempted all manner of devices to bring about an\r\nincrease of years, although they have not considered the problem in its\r\ngeneral bearing.\r\n\r\nIn Biblical times it was believed that contact with young girls would\r\nrejuvenate and prolong the life of feeble old men. In the first Book of\r\nKings it is related as follows:—\r\n\r\n“Now King David was old and stricken in years; and they covered him\r\nwith clothes, but he gat no heat.\r\n\r\n“Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for my Lord\r\nthe king a young virgin; let her stand before the king and let her\r\ncherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may\r\nget heat” (Kings I., chap. i.).\r\n\r\nThis device, afterwards called _gerokomy_, was employed by the Greeks\r\nand Romans, and has had followers in modern times. Boerhave, the\r\nfamous Dutch physician (1668-1738), “recommended an old burgomaster of\r\nAmsterdam to lie between two young girls, assuring him that he would\r\nthus recover strength and spirits.” After quoting this, Hufeland, the\r\nwell-known author of “Macrobiotique” in the eighteenth century, made\r\nthe following reflection:—“If it be remembered how the exhalations\r\nfrom newly opened animals stimulate paralysed limbs, and how the\r\napplication of living animals soothes a violent pain, we cannot refuse\r\nour approval to the method.”[107]\r\n\r\nCohausen, a doctor of the eighteenth century, published a treatise on\r\na Roman, Hermippus, who had died aged a hundred and fifteen years. He\r\nhad been a master in a school for young girls, and his life, passed in\r\ntheir midst, was greatly prolonged. “Accordingly,” commented Hufeland\r\n(p. 6), “he gives the excellent advice to breathe the air of young\r\ngirls night and morning, and gives his assurance that by so doing the\r\nvital forces will be strengthened and preserved, as adepts know well\r\nthat the breath of young girls contains the vital principle in all its\r\npurity.”\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern half of the world equal ingenuity was exercised in\r\nthe attempt to rejuvenate the body and renew the forces of man. The\r\nsuccessors of Lao-Tsé searched for a beverage that would confer\r\nimmortality and have recounted extraordinary matters concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of China, Chi-Hoang-Ti (221-209 B.C.), displayed extreme\r\nfriendliness to the Taoists, believing that these had the secret of\r\nlong life and immortality. In his reign, Su-Chi, a Taoist magician,\r\npersuaded him that eastwards of China there lay fortunate islands\r\ninhabited by genii whose pleasure it was to give their guests to\r\ndrink of a beverage conferring immortality. Chi-Hoang-Ti was so\r\ndelighted with the news that he equipped an expedition to discover the\r\nislands.[108]\r\n\r\nLater on, in the dynasty of the Tchengs (618-907), when Taoism\r\nhad again become a religion in favour at court, efforts were made\r\nto obtain imperial patronage for the draught of immortality, and\r\nmagicians were in high favour. The Taoist writers called this drink\r\n_Tan_ or _Kin-Tan_, the “golden elixir.” According to Mayers, the\r\nchief ingredients of this marvellous compound were “cinnabar, the\r\nred sulphate of mercury, and a red salt of arsenic, potassium and\r\nmother-of-pearl. The preparation of it required nine months, and it\r\npassed through nine changes. One who had drunk of it was changed to a\r\ncrane, and in this form could ascend to the dwellings of the genii,\r\nthere to abide with them.”[109]\r\n\r\nThe Taoists represent their saints, in the shade of willows, seeking\r\nthe elixir of life, and in Chinese Buddhist temples there are placed\r\nvotive cakes shaped like the tortoise, a sacred animal and the symbol\r\nof long life. Worshippers let stones of divination fall on these cakes\r\nand so ascertained if their lives were to be prolonged, promising for\r\neach subsequent year as many cakes as the divinity might demand.\r\n\r\nThe mysticism of the East reached Europe in the Middle Ages, and then,\r\nand even in modern times, drugs were used to prolong life. Cagliostro,\r\nthe celebrated quack of the eighteenth century, boasted that he had\r\ndiscovered an elixir of life by the use of which he had survived for\r\nmany thousand years.\r\n\r\nThere still exists, in some modern pharmacopœias, an “elixir ad\r\nlongam vitam” compounded of aloes and other purgatives. Analogous\r\npreparations are known, such as the “vital essence of Augsburg” which\r\nis a mixture of purgatives and resins.\r\n\r\nSerious physicians have rejected such preparations of the quacks.\r\nThey have abandoned the search for a specific, and, in their efforts\r\nto prolong human life, have relied on common rules of hygiene, such\r\nas cleanliness, exercise, fresh air, and general sobriety. In our own\r\ndays, Brown-Séquard is an isolated instance of a seeker for a specific\r\nagainst senescence. This distinguished physiologist, setting out from\r\nthe view that the weakness of old men is due partly to diminution of\r\nthe secretions of the testes, hoped to find a remedy in the employment\r\nof subcutaneous injections of emulsions of the testes of animals\r\n(dogs and guinea-pigs). Brown-Séquard,[110] then aged 72 years, gave\r\nhimself several such injections, and declared that he found himself\r\nreinforced and rejuvenated. Since then, numbers of persons have\r\nundergone the treatment which for a time was in vogue. The observations\r\nof physicians, made on old men and sick persons, have not justified the\r\nhopes which were entertained of the mode of treatment. Fürbringer,[111]\r\nin particular, working in Germany, has discredited the injections of\r\nBrown-Séquard. However, instead of following exactly the original\r\nprescription, Fürbringer employed a testicular emulsion which had\r\nbeen previously raised to the boiling-point. Brown-Séquard’s method\r\nhas not resisted scientific investigation, and although it is still\r\noccasionally employed in France, it has been given up in many countries.\r\n\r\nBrown-Séquard laid stress on the efficacy of emulsions of testis\r\nas opposed to chemical substances prepared from the gland. Other\r\nscientific men, on the other hand, have attached value to such\r\nsubstances and in particular to an organic alkali the salt of which is\r\nknown as spermine. That salt, made by Poehl of St. Petersburg, has been\r\nlargely used. Several observers declare that its employment, injected\r\nin solution or even absorbed directly as a powder, has been followed by\r\na strengthening of bodily power enfeebled by age or labour.\r\n\r\nAs I have no personal experience of spermine, I shall quote from\r\nProfessor Poehl[112] some indications of its efficacy. Several\r\nphysicians (Drs. Maximovitch, Bukojemsky, Krieger and Postoeff) have\r\ngiven injections of spermine to enfeebled old men who had lost appetite\r\nand sleep, and have noted improvement lasting for months. From the\r\ninstances given, I have selected that of an old lady of ninety-five\r\nyears, afflicted with severe sclerosis of the arteries, with no\r\nappetite, a bad digestion and constipation. This patient had complained\r\nfor several years of sacral pains, and moreover was nearly quite deaf\r\nand suffered from periodic attacks of malarial fever. The injections of\r\nspermine, given for a period of fifteen months, restored the old lady\r\nto such an extent that she recovered her power of hearing and felt the\r\nsacral pains only slightly and after a long walk. Her general condition\r\nwas highly satisfactory.\r\n\r\nSpermine, as it has been used medically, is prepared not only from the\r\ntestes of animals but from the prostate gland, ovary, pancreas, thyroid\r\ngland and spleen. The substance is not specially associated with\r\nspermatozoa but has a wide distribution in the mammalian body.\r\n\r\nIn the medical treatment of the evils of old age, testicular emulsions\r\nor spermine have not been so favoured as general hygienic measures. Dr.\r\nWeber,[113] a London medical man, has recently summarised more general\r\nmeasures, and his evidence is the more important as he has been able\r\nto test the efficacy of his precepts in his own case. Dr. Weber is 83\r\nyears old, and in his practice has cared for many other old men.\r\n\r\nThe following are the precepts which Dr. Weber formulated: All the\r\norgans must be preserved in a condition of vigour. It is necessary to\r\nrecognise and subdue any morbid tendencies whether these be hereditary\r\nor have been acquired during life. It is necessary to be moderate in\r\nfood and drink, and in all other physical pleasures. The air should\r\nbe pure in the dwelling and in the vicinity. It is necessary to take\r\nexercise daily, whatever be the weather. In many cases the respiratory\r\nmovements must be specially exercised, and exercise on level ground and\r\nup-hill should be taken. The persons should go to bed early and rise\r\nearly, and not sleep for more than six or seven hours. A bath should\r\nbe taken daily and the skin should be well rubbed, the water used\r\nbeing hot or cold, according to taste. Sometimes it is advantageous\r\nto use hot and cold water. Regular work and mental occupation are\r\nindispensable. It is useful to stimulate the enjoyment of life so\r\nthat the mind may be tranquil and full of hope. On the other hand,\r\nthe passions must be controlled and the nervous sensations of grief\r\navoided. Finally, there must be a resolute intention to preserve the\r\nhealth, to avoid alcohol and other stimulants as well as narcotics and\r\nsoothing drugs.\r\n\r\nBy following his own precepts, Dr. Weber has enjoyed a vigorous and\r\nhappy old age. A Mde. Nausenne, who died on March 12th, 1756, at the\r\nage of 125 years, in the Dinay Infirmary (Côtes-du-Nord) explained the\r\nsecret of her still greater longevity as follows: “Extreme sobriety, no\r\nworry, body and mind quite calm” (Chemin, _op. cit._, p. 101).\r\n\r\nHygienic measures have been the most successful in prolonging life and\r\nin lessening the ills of old age.\r\n\r\nAlthough until quite recently hygiene has rested upon a very small\r\nnumber of scientifically established facts, and although its precepts\r\nhave not been followed rigidly, none the less it has already succeeded\r\nin increasing the duration of human life. This becomes evident if we\r\ncompare the mortality tables of the present day with those of the past.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to state definitely that the mortality in civilised\r\ncountries has decreased on the whole in the last one or two centuries.\r\nI have taken some facts regarding this from the valuable monograph\r\nof M. Westergaard.[114] That author came to the conclusion that the\r\nmortality rate in the 19th century in civilised countries was “much\r\nlower than in most earlier centuries.” This diminution has been chiefly\r\nin infantile mortality. According to Mallet, the mortality rate of\r\ninfants in the first year of their life was, in Geneva, 26 per cent.\r\nin the 16th century, and fell gradually to 16-1/2 per cent. at the\r\nbeginning of the 19th century. A similar change has been reported from\r\nBerlin, Holland, Denmark and other places. However, it is not only very\r\nyoung infants that have shown a diminution in the death-rate. The life\r\nof old people has been prolonged to an extent equally remarkable. The\r\nfollowing are some of the facts which support this statement. Whilst\r\nthe old Protestant clergymen of Denmark at ages varying from 74-1/2 to\r\n89-1/2 years had a mortality rate of 22 per cent. in the second half\r\nof the 18th century, the rate had sunk to 16·4 per cent. by the middle\r\nof the 19th century. This is not an isolated fact. The old clergymen\r\nof England (65 to 95 years) have also come to live longer, because\r\nin the 18th century the mortality rate was 11·5 per cent. and in the\r\n19th century (1800-1860) only 10·8 per cent. There has been a similar\r\ndecrease in the mortality rate in the members of both sexes of the\r\nRoyal Houses of Europe (Westergaard, p. 284).\r\n\r\nFrom 1841 to 1850, in England and Wales 162·81 individuals out of every\r\nthousand of both sexes died annually, but the corresponding figure for\r\nthe period 1881 to 1890 was decreased to 153·67 per thousand.\r\n\r\nWestergaard (p. 296) has displayed in a most useful table the mortality\r\nin the chief countries of Europe and in the State of Massachusetts, in\r\ntwo periods of time. In the case of old persons from 70 to 75 years,\r\nthere has been a constant decrease in the death-rate, without any\r\nexceptions. The exact statistics collected by Pension Bureaus and Life\r\nAssurance Companies exhibit the same general tendency.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be disputed then that there has been a general increase\r\nin the duration of life, and that old people live longer at the\r\npresent time than in former ages. This fact, however, cannot be taken\r\nabsolutely, and it is still possible that in particular cases there may\r\nhave been more centenarians hitherto than at present.\r\n\r\nThe prolongation of life which has come to pass in recent centuries\r\nmust certainly be attributed to the advance of hygiene. The general\r\nmeasures for the preservation of health, although they were not\r\nspecially directed to old people, have had an effect of increasing\r\ntheir longevity. As in the 18th century and for the greater part of\r\nthe 19th, the science of hygiene was in a very rudimentary condition,\r\nwe may well believe that improvement in cleanliness and in the general\r\nconditions have contributed largely to the prolongation of life. It is\r\nnow a long time since Liebig said that the amount of soap used could\r\nbe taken as a measure of the degree of civilisation of a people. As\r\na matter of fact, cleanliness of the body brought about in the most\r\nsimple way, by washing with soap, has had a most important effect\r\nin lessening disease and mortality from disease. In this connection,\r\nthe fact recently published by Prof. Czerny,[115] a well-known German\r\nsurgeon, has a special interest. Although cancer, the special scourge\r\nof old age, has increased in recent times, one form of the disease,\r\ncancer of the skin, has diminished notably. “Cancers of the skin,”\r\nProf. Czerny says, “are met with almost exclusively on uncovered\r\nregions of the body, or on parts accessible to the hands. They develop\r\nespecially where the susceptibility is increased by ulcers or scars\r\nwhich are easily soiled. And so it happens that in the classes where\r\ncare is taken as to cleanliness cancer of the skin is very rare and\r\ncertainly much more rare than it used to be.”\r\n\r\nM. Westergaard thinks that vaccination against small-pox has been of\r\nconsiderable importance in lowering the death-rate in the 19th century.\r\nThis, however, can have had little effect on the duration of life in\r\nold people, as deaths due to small-pox in the old are excessively\r\nrare. For instance, in the second half of the 18th century, that is\r\nto say before the introduction of Jenner’s method, the mortality from\r\nsmall-pox at Berlin was 9·8 per cent. of all the deaths, but of these\r\nonly 0·6 per cent. were cases of persons more than fifteen years old.\r\nThe rest, that is to say, 99·3 per cent. fell on children under that\r\nage. It may be supposed that most of the old people at that time were\r\nalready protected by previous attacks of small-pox, contracted when\r\nthey were young.\r\n\r\nIf hygiene were able to prolong life when it was little developed, as\r\nwas the case until recently, we may well believe that, with our greater\r\nknowledge of to-day, a much better result will be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDISEASES THAT SHORTEN LIFE\r\n\r\n  Measures against infectious diseases as aiding in the\r\n  prolongation of life—Prevention of syphilis—Attempts to\r\n  prepare serums which could strengthen the higher elements\r\n  of the organism\r\n\r\n\r\nAttacks of infectious diseases incurred during life frequently shorten\r\nits duration and it has been observed that most centenarians have\r\nenjoyed good health throughout their lives. Syphilis is the most\r\nimportant of these diseases. It is not really a cause of death itself,\r\nbut it predisposes the organism to the attacks of other diseases,\r\namongst the latter being some particularly fatal to old people,\r\nsuch as diseases of the heart and blood-vessels (angina pectoris\r\nand aneurism of the aorta) and some malignant tumours, especially\r\ncancer of the tongue and of the mouth. To lengthen human life, it\r\nis a fundamental necessity to avoid infection by syphilis. To reach\r\nthis result everything must be done to spread medical knowledge about\r\nsuch diseases. It is absolutely necessary to overcome the deeply\r\nrooted prejudice in favour of concealing everything relating to\r\nsexual matters. Complete information should be widely spread as to\r\nthe means of protecting humanity against this awful scourge. It has\r\nnow been possible to apply experimental methods to the investigation\r\nof this disease, and science has obtained a series of results of the\r\nhighest practical utility. Prof. Neisser of Breslau, one of the most\r\ndistinguished of modern venereal physicians, has summed up the present\r\nstate of knowledge of these matters in the following lines.[116] “It is\r\nour duty as medical men,” he says, “to recommend strongly as a means of\r\ndisinfection in all possible cases of contagion the calomel ointment\r\nwhich Metchnikoff and Roux have advised.” It is to be hoped that future\r\ngenerations, by following this advice, will see an enormous diminution\r\nin the number of cases of syphilis.\r\n\r\nSyphilis, however, although a very important factor, is not alone\r\nin shortening the life of man. A very large number of persons die\r\nprematurely although they have not contracted that disease. We do not\r\nknow the duration of human life before the arrival of syphilis in\r\nEurope, but there is no reason to think that it was very different\r\nfrom what it is to-day. We must, therefore, try to prevent as many\r\ninfectious diseases as possible, and recent advances in medicine\r\nhave made this task much less difficult. Pneumonia, it is true, the\r\nmost common infectious disease amongst the old, cannot yet be easily\r\navoided. All the anti-pneumonic serums which have hitherto been\r\nprepared have turned out to have little efficacy; but there is no\r\nreason to give up the hope that this problem will yet be solved.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the heart, which are common in extreme old age, are\r\nparticularly difficult to avoid, because in most cases we do not know\r\nsufficiently well their primary causes. In so far as they depend upon\r\nintemperance or infectious diseases such as syphilis, they can be\r\navoided by the employment of suitable measures.\r\n\r\nAs the higher elements of the body in old people become weaker and are\r\ndevoured by the macrophags, it seems probable that the destruction or\r\ndeterioration of these voracious cells would tend to the prolongation\r\nof life. However, as the macrophags are indispensable in the struggle\r\nagainst the microbes of infectious diseases, and particularly of\r\nchronic disease, such as tuberculosis, it is necessary to preserve\r\nthem. We must turn rather to the idea of a remedy which could\r\nstrengthen the higher elements and make them a less ready prey to the\r\nmacrophags.\r\n\r\nIn the “Nature of Man” (Chap. III.) in discussing the simian origin\r\nof mankind, I touched on the existence of animal serums that have the\r\npower of dissolving the blood corpuscles of other species of animals.\r\nThere is now, in biological science, a new chapter upon such serums,\r\nwhich have been called cytotoxic serums because they are able to poison\r\nthe cells of organs.\r\n\r\nThe blood and blood serum of some animals act as poisons when they\r\nare introduced into an organism. Eels and snakes, even non-poisonous\r\nsnakes, are cases in point. A small quantity of the blood of a snake,\r\nan adder for instance, injected into a mammal (rabbit, guinea-pig, or\r\nmouse) soon brings about death. The blood of some mammals is poisonous\r\nto other mammals, although in a lesser degree than that of snakes. The\r\ndog is specially notable from the fact that its blood is poisonous to\r\nother mammals, whilst, on the other hand, the blood and blood serum\r\nof the sheep, goat, and horse have generally little effect on other\r\nanimals and on man. It is for this reason that these animals, and\r\nparticularly the horse, are used in the preparation of the serums\r\nemployed in medicine.\r\n\r\nNow, these harmless serums become poisonous when they have been taken\r\nfrom animals which have been first treated with the blood or the\r\norgans of other species of animals. For instance, the blood serum of\r\na sheep which has been treated with the blood of a rabbit becomes\r\npoisonous because it has acquired the power of dissolving the red blood\r\ncorpuscles of the rabbit. It is a poison in the case of the rabbit,\r\nbut is harmless to most other animals. The injection of the rabbit’s\r\nblood into the sheep has conferred on the sheep a new property which\r\ncomes into operation only with regard to the red blood corpuscles\r\nof the rabbit. We have here to do with something analogous to what\r\nhas been observed in the cases of serums used to arrest infectious\r\ndisease. When the bacilli of diphtheria, or their products, have been\r\ninjected into horses, there is produced an anti-diphtheric serum,\r\ncapable of curing diphtheria, but powerless against tetanus or plague.\r\nAfter M. J. M. Bordet of the Pasteur Institute had made his discovery\r\nof serums that had acquired the power of dissolving the red blood\r\ncorpuscles of other animals, the attempt was made to prepare similar\r\nserums directed against all the other elements of the body, such as\r\nwhite blood corpuscles, renal and nervous cells. In the course of\r\nthese investigations it was proved to be necessary to employ a certain\r\ndose of the serum in order to obtain the poisonous result. If smaller\r\nquantities of the poisonous dose were used, the reverse effect was\r\nproduced. Thus a serum, strong doses of which dissolved the red blood\r\ncorpuscles and so made them less numerous in the blood, increased the\r\nnumber of these when given in very small doses.\r\n\r\nM. Cantacuzène was the first to establish this fact in the case of\r\nthe rabbit, whilst M. Besredka and I myself did it in the case of\r\nman.[117] Since then M. Bélonovsky of Cronstadt has confirmed the\r\nresult on anæmic patients, treating them with small quantities of\r\nserum. He has been able to produce in them an increase in the number\r\nof the red blood corpuscles, and in the quantity of the red colouring\r\nmatter (hæmoglobin) in the blood. Later on M. André[118] devoted much\r\nattention to this matter at Lyons. He prepared a serum by injecting\r\nhuman blood into animals and made use of it in the case of several\r\npersons who suffered from anæmia from different causes. In the case\r\nof patients, the anæmic condition of which had hitherto remained\r\nstationary, Dr. André found a sudden increase in the number of red\r\ncorpuscles after injecting small doses of the serum. M. Besredka,\r\nin the case of laboratory animals, increased the number of white\r\ncorpuscles by injecting them with a small quantity of a serum, strong\r\ndoses of which destroyed these cells.\r\n\r\nThese facts are only a special case of the general rule that small\r\ndoses of poisons increase the activity of the elements that are killed\r\nby large doses. In order to increase the activity of the heart, medical\r\nmen give successfully small doses of cardiac poisons such as digitalis.\r\nAs a commercial process, the activity of yeasts is increased by\r\nsubmitting them to weak doses of substances (fluoride of sodium) which,\r\ngiven in larger quantities, would kill them.\r\n\r\nMy general conclusion from these facts is that it is logical to lay\r\ndown the principle that the higher elements of our body could be\r\nstrengthened by subjecting them to the action of small doses of the\r\nappropriate cytotoxic serums. There is, however, much difficulty in\r\nputting this into practice. It is quite easy to obtain human blood\r\nto inject into animals with the object of preparing a serum which\r\ncan increase the number of red corpuscles. On the other hand, it is\r\nextremely difficult to get human bodies sufficiently fresh to use them\r\nfor a practical purpose. According to law, _post mortem_ examinations\r\ncan be made only after an interval of time in course of which the\r\ntissues have changed; besides, the organs obtained in this way are\r\nfrequently affected by injuries or diseases militating against their\r\nuse. Even in Paris, with its three million inhabitants, it is extremely\r\nrare that there is a good opportunity for the preparation of human\r\ncytotoxic serums. In two or three years, during which Dr. Weinberg has\r\ncollected the organs from human bodies fairly fresh, he has been unable\r\nto obtain sufficiently active serums.\r\n\r\nThe best results have been obtained from new-born infants which have\r\nbeen killed by some accident in the process of child-birth, as in them\r\nthe organs are in a normal state. However, owing to the advance in\r\nthe practice of obstetrics, such accidents, already infrequent, are\r\nbecoming extremely rare. In such conditions we may have to wait long\r\nbefore getting a positive result, unless the future will find some\r\nmethod of obtaining the necessary materials for this difficult and\r\ninteresting purpose.\r\n\r\nAs it is so difficult to prepare a remedy which can strengthen the\r\nweakened higher elements of the body, it may be easier to find a means\r\nof preventing the weakening which interferes so much with our desire to\r\nlive long. As the products of microbes are the most active agents in\r\ndeteriorating our tissues, we must look towards them for the solution\r\nof the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL PUTREFACTION SHORTENS LIFE\r\n\r\n  Uselessness of the large intestine in man—Case of\r\n  a woman whose large intestine was inactive for six\r\n  months—Another case where the greater part of the\r\n  large intestine was completely shut off—Attempts to\r\n  disinfect the contents of the large intestine—Prolonged\r\n  mastication as a means of preventing intestinal\r\n  putrefaction\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general measures of hygiene directed against infectious diseases\r\nplay a part in prolonging the lives of old people, but, in addition to\r\nthe microbes which invade the body from outside, there is a rich source\r\nof harm in the microbes which inhabit the body. The most important of\r\nthese belong to the intestinal flora, which is abundant and varied.\r\n\r\nThe intestinal microbes are most numerous in the large intestine. This\r\norgan, which is useful to mammals the food of which consists of rough\r\nbulky vegetable matter, and which require a large reservoir for the\r\nwaste of the process of digestion, is certainly useless in the case\r\nof man.[119] In the “Nature of Man” I have dealt with this question\r\nat length, as it was an important example of what I regard as the\r\ndisharmonies of the human constitution. A case upon which I have always\r\nlaid great stress is that of a woman who lived for thirty-seven years,\r\nalthough her large intestine was atrophied and inactive, as this seems\r\nto be a remarkable proof of the uselessness of the organ in the human\r\nbody. The small size or complete absence of the large intestine in\r\nmany vertebrates confirms my conclusion. None the less, some of my\r\ncritics think that my argument is incomplete. To strengthen it, I may\r\ncall their attention to a medical observation which is as valuable as\r\nif it had been an experiment. It relates to a woman, sixty-two years\r\nold, a patient of Prof. Kocher at Berne. She had been suffering from a\r\nstrangulated hernia associated with gangrene of part of the intestine,\r\nand had to be operated upon suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe gangrenous portion of the ileum having been removed, the healthy\r\npart was implanted in the skin so as to form an artificial aperture\r\nthrough which waste matter from the food passed to the exterior\r\nwithout traversing the large intestine. Although the patient was old\r\nand seriously ill, the operation, performed by M. Tavel, was quite\r\nsuccessful. Six months later, in a new operation, the small intestine\r\nwas rejoined to the large intestine so that the fæces were again able\r\nto pass to the exterior by the natural channel. In this case, then, the\r\nlarge intestine was thrown out of use for half a year, not only without\r\ninjury to the general health, but with the result that the patient was\r\ncompletely cured and gained in weight. MM. Macfadyen, Nencki, and Mde.\r\nSieber[120] studied the digestive processes in the small intestine\r\nand the nutritive metabolism, and determined that these were active\r\nand healthy, the absence of intestinal putrefaction, that evil of the\r\nconstitution, being specially favourable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Diagram of the lower bowel in a female patient.\r\n\r\n_A.C.N._, Artificial anus: _A.S._, Insertion of the ileum to the colon.\r\n\r\n(After M. Mauclaire.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Diagram of the lower bowel, after a third\r\noperation, on the case in Fig. 19.\r\n\r\n(After M. Mauclaire.)]\r\n\r\nIn six months of non-action, the part played by an organ can be\r\nsatisfactorily estimated. M. Mauclaire,[121] however, has put on record\r\na case the history of which was longer. In 1902 he operated on a young\r\nwoman and produced an artificial anus, there being no escape of fæcal\r\nmatter by the ordinary channel. Ten months later M. Mauclaire operated\r\na second time and shut off a portion of the intestine. He left the\r\nartificial anus, but cut across the lower end of the small intestine\r\nand inserted it near the iliac end of the descending colon (Fig. 19).\r\nFor several days after the operation the fæces were passed by the\r\nnormal aperture, as the small intestine now communicated directly with\r\nthe large intestine, near the rectum. This condition, however, did not\r\npersist, for the fæcal matter began to flow back through the excluded\r\nportion of the large intestine, so reaching the artificial anus, and\r\ncausing inconvenience. Giving up the hope that this would cease, M.\r\nMauclaire performed a third operation twenty months later. He cut\r\nacross the large intestine near the point where the small intestine\r\nhad been artificially led into it (Fig. 20), so dividing the digestive\r\ntube into two parts, one of which remained in communication with the\r\nnatural anus, whilst the other, consisting of nearly the whole of\r\nthe large intestine, communicated with the exterior by the artificial\r\nanus. In the new state of affairs, the food refuse passed directly\r\ninto the terminal portion of the large intestine, and thence, by way\r\nof the rectum, to the exterior through the normal anus without being\r\nable to pass up the large intestine towards the artificial anus. In\r\nthis last operation about a yard of the small intestine and the greater\r\npart of the large intestine, the cæcum, and ascending, transverse and\r\ndescending colons were removed from activity.\r\n\r\nBy the kindness of M. Mauclaire, I have been able to watch his patient\r\nduring the last four years. I satisfied myself that after the supposed\r\nexclusion of the large intestine, food dejecta ascended the colon and\r\nemerged by the artificial anus. There was such an accumulation of\r\nwaste in the large intestine that fragments did not emerge until three\r\nweeks after the meal of which they had formed part. It was only after\r\nthe final operation, that in which the large intestine was separated,\r\nthat the dejecta escaped only by the natural anus, whilst a little\r\nmucus containing microbes was passed through the artificial aperture.\r\nEven three years after the operation, mucus continued to escape by the\r\nlatter aperture, it being shown thus that after the large intestine had\r\nceased to be a channel for the fæces, its walls continued to secrete\r\nalthough otherwise it had lost its function completely. Nevertheless\r\nthe condition of this patient improved and she lived perfectly well\r\nwithout a functional large intestine. She takes food well but has to go\r\nto stool three or four times a day and has a tendency to diarrhœa.\r\nThe excreta are smooth and often nearly liquid, especially after fruit\r\nhas been eaten.\r\n\r\nThe case I have been describing, and which I am still keeping under\r\nobservation, demonstrates once more the uselessness of the human large\r\nintestine; it should convert the most sceptical critic. But it also\r\nshows that the suppression of nearly the entire large intestine for\r\nseveral years does not completely get rid of the intestinal flora. Even\r\nwithout this evidence, however, I do not suggest that removal of the\r\nlarge intestine can be thought of as a means to prevent the pernicious\r\neffect of the intestinal flora.\r\n\r\nIs it possible, without operative interference, to take direct action\r\nagainst the intestinal flora by the use of antiseptics? Consideration\r\nof this is already ancient history. When the theory that the intestine\r\nwas a source of auto-intoxication was propounded, M. Bouchard[122] made\r\nthe attempt to cure such cases by disinfecting the digestive tube with\r\n[Greek: b]-naphthol. He found, however, that that antiseptic, like\r\nmany others, not only did not completely disinfect the intestine but\r\nsometimes had a harmful effect on the body.\r\n\r\nM. Stern[123] has shown, in an elaborate memoir, that such antiseptics\r\nas calomel, salol, [Greek: b]-naphthol, naphthaline, and camphor, when\r\nadministered in quantities compatible with health, do not disinfect\r\nthe digestive tube at all. More recently M. Strasburger[124] has shown\r\nthat when naphthaline has been given in quantities sufficient to impart\r\nits odour to the fæces, the intestinal microbes, so far from being\r\ndiminished, are even increased in numbers. On the other hand, after\r\nmeals consisting of milk to which there has been added an antiseptic\r\nin the proportion of a quarter of a gram to the litre, the intestinal\r\nmicrobes are really reduced in number. Strasburger obtained his best\r\nresults with tanocol. Two persons who used, according to this method,\r\nthree to six grams of tanacol per day, displayed a notable reduction in\r\nquantity of the intestinal flora.\r\n\r\nStrasburger’s conclusion was that “the attempt to destroy the\r\nintestinal microbes by the use of chemical agents has little chance of\r\nsuccess.” It cannot be denied that under special circumstances it is\r\npossible to decrease the number of microbes, especially in the small\r\nintestine. But this result is small and may be followed by the contrary\r\neffect, for the natural means of defence of the intestine against\r\nmicrobes are weakened, and the intestine itself may be harmed more than\r\nthe microbes.\r\n\r\nStrasburger, moreover, is no convinced advocate of the use of\r\npurgatives. The diminution of the sulpho-conjugate ethers in the\r\nurine, which certainly may follow the use of purgatives, does not\r\nnecessarily indicate reduced putrefaction in the intestine, but may\r\npoint only to a lessened absorption of the bacterial products. Such an\r\ninterpretation is supported by an observed fact; in the case of a dog\r\nbelonging to Strasburger, which had a fistula of the small intestine,\r\nthe diarrhœa induced by calomel was accompanied by an indubitable\r\nincrease in the total quantity of intestinal microbes.\r\n\r\nStrasburger thinks that the most favourable results can be obtained\r\nby aiding the intestine in the discharge of its normal function. If\r\nit can be brought to digest the food more completely, there is the\r\nless pabulum left for the microbes. A similar result can be reached by\r\nlowering the amount of food taken, and to this course the beneficial\r\neffects of starvation in acute diseases of the intestine may be\r\nattributed.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusion, reached after many experiments on the\r\ndisinfection of the intestine, is unfavourable. Very little is to be\r\nexpected from the method. None the less I cannot regard the matter\r\nas definitely settled. Cohendy has investigated the effect on the\r\nintestinal flora of thymol which was administered in several cases with\r\nthe object of destroying parasites. From nine to twelve grammes of\r\nthymol were administered to each patient in the space of three days,\r\nand there was a notable antiseptic effect, Cohendy believing that the\r\nquantity of microbes had been reduced to a thirteenth.\r\n\r\nSuch facts prove only that the antiseptic treatment is available\r\nup to a certain point. To attain the results, however, such large\r\nquantities must be used that the treatment can be applied only in\r\nspecial cases and at long intervals. More use can be made of simple\r\npurgatives which do not kill the microbes but eliminate them by the\r\nnormal channel. It has been urged repeatedly that calomel, which is\r\noften used as a purgative, acts also as an intestinal antiseptic;\r\nbut it is probable that its influence in reducing the intestinal\r\nflora is merely mechanical. It has been shown that calomel, like\r\nsome other purgatives, lessens intestinal putrefaction, the evidence\r\nbeing the decrease in the sulpho-conjugate ethers in the urine. But\r\nalthough the diarrhœa induced by purgatives generally has such a\r\nresult, spontaneous diarrhœas such as those of typhoid fever and of\r\nintestinal tuberculosis are associated with increased putrefaction.[125]\r\n\r\nIt is clear, however these matters may be settled, that regular\r\nactivity of the bowels, increased by the occasional use of purgatives,\r\nmust diminish the formation of intestinal poisons, and therefore also\r\nthe damage done by these to the higher elements of the body.\r\n\r\nWhen I asked the relatives of Mde. Robineau if they could tell me of\r\nany special circumstance which in their opinion had contributed to\r\nthe extreme duration of the life of this old lady, they replied as\r\nfollows:—“We are convinced that a slight bodily derangement, present\r\nfor the last fifty years, has tended to prolong the life of the old\r\nlady. It cannot be said that she has suffered from diarrhœa, but\r\nshe has been often subject to frequent calls of nature.” It was most\r\nremarkable that the old lady showed no traces of sclerosis of the\r\narteries. I may mention the strongly contrasting case of one of my\r\nold colleagues to whom a natural desire to empty the bowels came only\r\nonce a week. A more frequent call was a sign of illness in his case.\r\nNow sclerosis of the arteries appeared in so marked a form that he\r\ndied from it before he had reached the age of fifty years. This may be\r\nadded to the list of facts which point to a close association between\r\nsclerosis of the arteries and the functions of the digestive tube.\r\n\r\nRecently, at the suggestion of Mr. Fletcher,[126] the advantage of\r\neating extremely slowly has been recognised, the object being to\r\nprepare for the utilisation of the food materials, and to prevent\r\nintestinal putrefaction. Certainly the habit of eating quickly favours\r\nthe multiplication of microbes round about the lumps of food which have\r\nbeen swallowed without sufficient mastication. It is quite harmful,\r\nhowever, to chew the food too long, and to swallow it only after it\r\nhas been kept in the mouth for a considerable time. Too complete a\r\nuse of the food material causes want of tone in the intestinal wall,\r\nfrom which as much harm may come as from imperfect mastication. In\r\nAmerica, where Fletcher’s theory took its origin, there has already\r\nbeen described under the name of “Bradyfagy” a disease arising from the\r\nhabit of eating too slowly. Dr. Einhorn,[127] a well-known specialist\r\nin the diseases of the digestive system, has found that several cases\r\nof this disease were rapidly cured when the patients made up their\r\nminds to eat more quickly again. Comparative physiology supplies us\r\nwith arguments against too prolonged mastication. Ruminants, which\r\ncarry out to the fullest extent Mr. Fletcher’s plan, are notable for\r\nextreme intestinal putrefaction and for the short duration of their\r\nlives. On the other hand, birds and reptiles, which have a very poor\r\nmechanism for breaking up food, enjoy much longer lives.\r\n\r\nProlonged mastication, then, cannot be recommended as a preventative\r\nof intestinal putrefaction any more than the surgical removal of the\r\nlarge intestine or the disinfection of the digestive tube. The field\r\nlies open for other means which may probably solve the problem more\r\ncompletely and more practically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nLACTIC ACID AS INHIBITING INTESTINAL PUTREFACTION\r\n\r\n  The development of the intestinal flora in\r\n  man—Harmlessness of sterilised food—Means of\r\n  preventing the putrefaction of food—Lactic fermentation\r\n  and its anti-putrescent action—Experiments on\r\n  man and mice—Longevity in races which use soured\r\n  milk—Comparative study of different soured\r\n  milks—Properties of the Bulgarian _Bacillus_—Means\r\n  of preventing intestinal putrefaction with the help of\r\n  microbes\r\n\r\n\r\nAt birth the human intestine is full, but contains no microbes.\r\nMicrobes very soon appear in it, because the meconium, the contents\r\nof the intestines of new-born children, composed of bile and cast-off\r\nintestinal mucus cells, is an excellent culture medium for them. In the\r\nfirst hours after birth, microbes begin to reach the intestine. In the\r\nfirst day, before the child has taken any food whatever, there is to\r\nbe found in the meconium a varied flora, composed of several species\r\nof microbes. Under the influence of the mother’s milk this flora is\r\nreduced and comes to be composed almost entirely of a special microbe\r\ndescribed by M. Tissier and called by him _Bacillus bifidus_.\r\n\r\nThe food, therefore, has an influence on the microbes of the intestine.\r\nIf the child be fed with cow’s milk, the flora is richer in species\r\nthan in the case of a child suckled by its mother. Later on, also,\r\nthe flora varies with the food, as has been proved by MM. Macfadyen,\r\nNencki, and Mde. Sieber in the case of a woman with an intestinal\r\nfistula. The dependence of the intestinal microbes on the food makes\r\nit possible to adopt measures to modify the flora in our bodies and\r\nto replace the harmful microbes by useful microbes. Unfortunately,\r\nour actual knowledge of the intestinal flora is still very imperfect\r\nbecause of the impossibility of finding artificial media in which it\r\ncould be grown. Notwithstanding this difficulty, however, a rational\r\nsolution of the problem must be sought.\r\n\r\nMan, even in the savage condition, prepares his food before eating it.\r\nHe submits much of it to the action of fire, thus notably lessening the\r\nnumber of microbes. Microbes enter the digestive tube in vast numbers\r\nwith raw food, and in order to lessen the number of species in the\r\nintestines, it is important to eat only cooked food and to drink only\r\nliquids that have been previously boiled. In that way, although we\r\ncannot destroy all the microbes in the food, because some of them can\r\nwithstand the temperature of the boiling point of water, we can kill\r\nthe great majority of them.\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been supposed that cooked or completely sterilised\r\nfood (that is to say food that has been subjected to a temperature of\r\nfrom 248°-284° Fahr.) is harmful to the organism and that much of it\r\nis not well digested. From this point of view protests have been made\r\nagainst the feeding of infants with sterilised milk or even with boiled\r\nmilk. Although in certain cases sterilised milk is not well supported\r\nby infants, it cannot be doubted but that boiled milk and cooked\r\nfood are generally successful. The large number of children brought\r\nup successfully on boiled cow’s milk and the health of travellers in\r\narctic regions are ample proof of this. I have been told by M. Charcot\r\nthat in his voyage to the antarctic regions, he and his companions\r\nlived entirely on sterilised food, or on cooked food such as the flesh\r\nof seals and penguins. As they had no green food nor fresh fruit, the\r\nonly raw food that they ate was a little cheese. Living under these\r\nconditions, all the members of the expedition enjoyed good health,\r\nand there was no case of digestive disturbance in the whole period of\r\nsixteen months.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that abstaining from raw food, and so reducing largely\r\nthe entrance of new microbes, by no means causes the disappearance\r\nof the intestinal flora already existing. We must reckon with that\r\nand with the evil that it does by weakening the higher cells of the\r\ntissues. As the part of the flora that does most damage consists of\r\nmicrobes which cause putrefaction of the contents of the intestine and\r\nharmful fermentations, particularly butyric fermentation, it is against\r\nthese that our efforts must be directed.\r\n\r\nLong before the science of bacteriology was in existence, men had\r\nturned their attention to methods of preventing putrefaction. Food,\r\nespecially if it be kept in a warm place or in a moist atmosphere, soon\r\nbegins to putrefy and to become unpleasant to the taste and dangerous\r\nto the health. Everyone has known cases of poisoning from putrid flesh\r\nor other food material. Foà,[128] the explorer of Central Africa, has\r\nrelated that once, when they were starving, he and his men came on the\r\nputrefying body of an elephant. The negroes rushed to lay hold of the\r\ncarrion, but Foà tried to dissuade them, explaining that to eat flesh\r\nin such a state was as bad as taking poison. All did not listen to him,\r\nand three negroes, who had taken pieces of the body, swallowed them\r\nbefore they had been properly cooked. All three died in a few days,\r\nwith the neck and throat swollen, the tongue almost paralysed, and the\r\nabdomen inflated.\r\n\r\nIn another case, sausages made of putrid horse flesh caused an epidemic\r\nat Rohrsdorf, in Prussia, in 1885.[129] About forty people fell ill\r\nafter having eaten the sausages, which, according to witnesses, were\r\ngreen in colour, smelt badly, and had a revolting appearance. One\r\nperson died, whilst the others recovered after cholera-like symptoms.\r\nIt is true that all putrefying food does not produce the same effect.\r\nMM. Tissier and Martelly[130] found no digestive trouble after having\r\neaten food that was quite putrid. Everyone knows that the Chinese\r\nprepare a dish particularly pleasant to gourmets by allowing eggs\r\nto putrefy. Some decaying cheeses are harmful to the health, but\r\nothers can be eaten with impunity. The reason of this is that whilst\r\nputrefying food may contain microbes and dangerous toxins, it does\r\nnot contain them in all cases. On the other hand, we must take into\r\naccount the different susceptibilities of people to the harmful action\r\nof microbes and their products. Some can swallow without any evil\r\nresult a quantity of microbes which in the case of other individuals\r\nwould produce a fatal attack of cholera. Everything depends upon the\r\nresistance offered to the microbes by the invaded organism.\r\n\r\nExperiments on animals fed on putrefying food have also given varied\r\nresults. Some animals eat it without any harm resulting, others have\r\nattacks of vomiting and show such a repugnance that it is impossible to\r\ncontinue the experiment.\r\n\r\nNot only flesh and other animal substances, but vegetables can undergo\r\nputrefaction and fermentation (butyric) which make it dangerous\r\nto eat them. Many accidents have occurred in man as the result of\r\ndeteriorated preserved fruit. Vegetables, preserved in silos to feed\r\ncattle, sometimes go wrong. “If, for instance, rainy days come after\r\nsunny days, so that the uncovered fodder is wetted again, the resulting\r\nensilage is poor and has an extremely unpleasant butyric odour, so that\r\nthe animals turn from it.” Sometimes the fodder grows black in the\r\nsilo, and acquires a special smell. “The animals will take it only in\r\nthe absence of other food; their excreta become black, and if they are\r\nkept on such a diet for a time they waste in a marked manner.”[131]\r\n\r\nIn popular practice, the value of acids for preserving animal\r\nand vegetable food and for preventing putrefaction has long been\r\nrecognised. Meats of all kinds, fish and vegetables have been\r\n“marinated” with vinegar, as the acetic acid in that substance, the\r\nproduct of bacteria, wards off putrefaction. If the materials which\r\nit is desired to preserve give off acids themselves, the addition of\r\nvinegar may be unnecessary. For this reason some animal products such\r\nas milk, or vegetables rich in sugar become acid spontaneously and so\r\ncan be preserved. Soured milk can be made into many kinds of cheese,\r\nand these last for longer or shorter times. Many vegetables can undergo\r\na natural process of souring, when they “keep” without difficulty.\r\nThus cabbage becomes “sauerkraut” and beetroot and cucumbers pass\r\ninto an acid state. In many countries, as for instance in Russia, the\r\nuse of acidified vegetables is of great importance in the food-supply\r\nof the populace. Fresh fruit and vegetables cannot be obtained in the\r\nlong winters, during which the people consume large quantities of\r\ncucumbers, melons, apples, and other fruits which have undergone an\r\nacid fermentation in which lactic acid is the chief product. During\r\nsummer, milk, which acidifies readily, is the chief source of acid\r\nmaterials for consumption. The chief beverage is “kwass,” of which\r\nblack bread is the main ingredient, and this passes through not only an\r\nalcoholic fermentation, but an acidifying change in which lactic acid\r\nis the most important product.\r\n\r\nRye bread, the chief food of the populace, is also a product of\r\nfermentations amongst which the lactic acid fermentation is most\r\nimportant, but in other kinds of bread also there is a fermentation in\r\nwhich some of the sugar is transformed to lactic acid.\r\n\r\nSoured milk, because of the lactic acid in it, can impede the\r\nputrefaction of meat. In certain countries, accordingly, meat is\r\npreserved in acid skimmed milk with the result that putrefaction\r\nis prevented. Lactic acid fermentation is equally important in the\r\nfood supply of cattle. It is the chief agent that, in the process of\r\npreserving vegetation in silos, hinders putrefaction. Finally, the same\r\nfermentation serves in distilleries to preserve the must from which\r\nalcohol is prepared.\r\n\r\nThis short review is in itself enough to show the great importance of\r\nlactic fermentation as a means of stopping putrefaction and butyric\r\nfermentation, both of which hinder the preservation of organic\r\nsubstances and are capable of exciting disturbances in the organism.\r\n\r\nAs lactic fermentation serves so well to arrest putrefaction in\r\ngeneral, why should it not be used for the same purpose within the\r\ndigestive tube?\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that putrefaction and butyric\r\nfermentation are arrested in the presence of sugar. Whereas meat\r\npreserved without special care soon putrefies, milk in exactly the\r\nsame conditions does not putrefy, but becomes sour, the reason being\r\nthat meat is poor in sugar whereas milk contains a good deal of it.\r\nHowever, the scientific explanation of this fundamental fact is\r\ndifficult. It has been shown conclusively that sugar itself cannot\r\nprevent putrefaction. Milk, for instance, however rich in sugar it\r\nmay be, readily putrefies in certain conditions. Sugar preserves\r\norganic matter from putrefaction only because it can readily undergo\r\nlactic fermentation, and this fermentation is the work of the microbes\r\ndescribed fifty years ago by Pasteur. That great discovery proved the\r\npart played by microbes in fermentation and founded bacteriology, a\r\nscience equally rich in theory and in practice.\r\n\r\nI need not pause to develop the theme that the anti-putrescent action\r\nof the lactic fermentation depends on the production of lactic acid by\r\nmicrobes, because I have explained the matter at length in the tenth\r\nchapter of the “Nature of Man.” If the lactic acid be neutralised,\r\nthe organic matter soon putrefies, notwithstanding the presence of\r\nthe lactic microbes. The most important point is as to whether lactic\r\nfermentation really arrests intestinal putrefaction. Several sets of\r\nobservations have been made upon this matter. Dr. Herter,[132] of\r\nNew York, injected directly into the small intestine of a number of\r\ndogs quantities of different microbes. To test the action of these on\r\nintestinal putrefaction, he investigated the sulpho-conjugate ethers\r\nin the urine, as he believed, in accordance with current and well\r\njustified opinion, that these substances are the best proofs of the\r\nexistence of putrefaction. He found that whilst the introduction of\r\nquantities of _Bacillus coli_ or _Bacillus proteus_ increased the\r\nintestinal putrefaction, lactic bacilli notably lessened it. Herter\r\nfound a notable diminution of sulpho-conjugate ethers in the urine of\r\ndogs which had been treated with the lactic microbes.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which Dr. M. Cohendy[133] performed upon himself during\r\na period of nearly six months are still more interesting.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Cohendy had proved that much intestinal putrefaction occurred\r\nduring a period of 25 days, in which he lived on an ordinary mixed\r\ndiet, he began to take pure cultures of lactic bacillus, taken from\r\nyahourth. In a period of 74 days, he took quantities varying from 280\r\nto 350 grams of the culture.\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the urine during the progress of the experiment showed\r\nthat intestinal putrefaction had notably decreased whilst the lactic\r\nbacilli were being taken, and that the diminution persisted seven weeks\r\nafter the taking of the bacilli ceased. Dr. Cohendy gives it as the\r\ndirect result of his experiment that the introduction of lactic ferment\r\ninto the intestine definitely arrests putrefaction. He obtained this\r\nresult on a diet consisting of 400 grams of soup, 150 of meat, 700 of\r\ngrain-food, 400 of green vegetables, 300 of fruits and dessert and a\r\nlitre of water. He came to the conclusion that the elimination of meat\r\nfrom the diet was unnecessary, as the particular kind of lactic ferment\r\nhe employed was extremely active in inhibiting the proteolytic ferments.\r\n\r\nLater experiments made by Dr. Cohendy showed that the lactic bacillus\r\nbecame so acclimatised in the human intestine that it was to be found\r\nthere several weeks after it had been swallowed.\r\n\r\nDr. Pochon, assistant to Professor Combe[134] at Lausanne, has repeated\r\non himself the experiments of Cohendy. He took for several weeks\r\nmilk curdled with pure cultures of lactic acid microbes and obtained\r\n“results that were quite definite as to intestinal putrefaction.”\r\nAnalysis of his urine showed that there was a marked diminution of\r\nindol and phenol, substances which are certain indexes of intestinal\r\nputrefaction.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such observations on lactic bacilli there is a good deal\r\nof knowledge as to the effect of lactic acid taken in bulk. The result\r\nof the various observations[135] shows that the acid lessens intestinal\r\nputrefaction and lowers the quantity of sulpho-conjugate ethers in the\r\nurine. This fact explains why favourable results follow the use of\r\nlactic acid in many intestinal diseases such as infantile diarrhœa,\r\ntuberculous enteritis and even Asiatic cholera. The addition of this\r\nremedy to practical therapeutics is due chiefly to Professor Hayem.\r\nIt is employed not only in the treatment of diseases of the digestive\r\nsystem (dyspepsia, enteritis and colitis), but is indicated also in\r\ndiabetes and is used locally in tuberculous ulcerations of the larynx.\r\nAs quantities up to twelve grams can be given by the mouth daily, it is\r\nplain that the system is tolerant of this acid. It is either oxidised\r\nin the tissues or excreted with the urine. In the case of a diabetic\r\nwoman who had taken 80 grams of lactic acid in four days, Nencki and\r\nSieber[136] found no traces of it in the urine. On the other hand,\r\nStadelmann[137] found a notable quantity of the acid in another\r\ndiabetic patient who had been taking over four grams daily.\r\n\r\nThe general interpretation of the benefits gained from the use of\r\nlactic acid ferments is that they depend solely on the action of the\r\nlactic acid which they produce in preventing the multiplication of\r\nthe microbes which cause putrefaction. Recent investigations made by\r\nDr. Bélonowsky, at the Pasteur Institute, show that a lactic ferment\r\nisolated from yahourth and described as the Bulgarian bacillus owes\r\nits antiseptic powers not only to lactic acid but to another substance\r\nwhich it secretes. Dr. Bélonowsky has studied the effects of this\r\nbacillus upon mice, by adding to their previously sterilised food\r\nquantities of this lactic microbe. As control experiments he fed\r\nother mice on food to which lactic acid had been added in quantities\r\ncorresponding to the quantity produced by the Bulgarian bacillus, or\r\nwhich had been mixed with other kinds of bacilli. Another set of mice\r\nwere given normal food without the addition of either microbes or\r\nlactic acid.\r\n\r\nOut of these groups of mice, those which had been given the Bulgarian\r\nbacillus thrived best and had most progeny. Their droppings showed\r\nfewest microbes, particularly microbes of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nThe next stage in Dr. Bélonowsky’s experiments was to feed mice not\r\nwith living quantities of the Bulgarian bacillus, but with cultures\r\nwhich had been sterilised by heat (120°-140° Fahr.). These mice lived\r\nas well as those to which living cultures had been supplied, and\r\nnotably better than those supplied with pure lactic acid. It is evident\r\ntherefore that there is some other product of this bacillus which\r\nfavours life by preventing intestinal putrefaction.\r\n\r\nDr. Bélonowsky showed, moreover, that the Bulgarian bacillus cures a\r\nspecial intestinal disease known as mouse typhus.\r\n\r\nThe experiments which I have described show that intestinal\r\nputrefaction is to be combated not by lactic acid itself, but by the\r\nintroduction into the organism of cultures of the lactic bacilli.\r\nThe latter become acclimatised in the human digestive tube as they\r\nfind there the sugary material required for their subsistence, and by\r\nproducing disinfecting bodies benefit the organism which supports them.\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial human beings have absorbed quantities of lactic\r\nmicrobes by consuming in the uncooked condition substances such as\r\nsoured milk, kephir, sauerkraut, or salted cucumbers which have\r\nundergone lactic fermentation. By these means they have unknowingly\r\nlessened the evil consequences of intestinal putrefaction. In the Bible\r\nsoured milk is frequently spoken of. When Abraham entertained the three\r\nangels he set before them soured milk and sweet milk and the calf which\r\nhe had dressed (Genesis xviii. 8). In his fifth book, Moses enumerates\r\namongst the food which Jehovah had given his people to eat “Soured milk\r\nof kine and goat’s milk, with fat of lambs and rams of the breed of\r\nBashan, and goats with the fat of kidneys” (Deut. xxxii. 14).[138]\r\n\r\nA food known as “Leben raib,” which is a soured milk, prepared from\r\nthe milk of buffaloes, kine or goats, has been used in Egypt from\r\nthe remotest antiquity. A similar preparation known as “yahourth” is\r\nfamiliar to the populations of the Balkan Peninsula. The natives of\r\nAlgiers make a kind of “leben” not identical with the Egyptian form.\r\n\r\nSoured milk is consumed in great quantities in Russia in two forms,\r\n“prostokwacha,” which is raw milk spontaneously coagulated and soured,\r\nand “varenetz,” which is boiled milk soured with a yeast.\r\n\r\nThe chief food of many natives of tropical Africa consists of soured\r\nmilk. The staple diet of the Mpeseni is “a curdled milk, almost\r\nsolidified.” “Meat is eaten only on ceremonial occasions.” According\r\nto Foà, a tribe of the Nyassa-Tanganyika plateau, like the Zulus, take\r\nmilk only in the form of a raw cheese mixed with salt and pepper.\r\n\r\nDr. Lima of Mossamedes, in West Africa, has told me that the natives\r\nof many regions south of Angola live almost entirely on milk. They\r\nemploy the cream as an ointment for the skin, whilst the milk, soured\r\nand curdled, is their staple food. M. Nogueira reported the same\r\ncircumstances nearly fifty years ago after his journey in the province\r\nof Angola.\r\n\r\nJust as cheeses vary in different countries, so curdled milk varies\r\nslightly according to the nature of the flora of microbes. Taking all\r\nthe soured milks that are produced by natural processes, it may be said\r\nthat the greater number of them contain not only microbes that produce\r\nlactic acid, but also yeasts that cause alcoholic fermentations.\r\nKephir, which is prepared from the milk of kine, and koumiss, which\r\nis a product of mares’ milk, are notably alcoholic. Koumiss is the\r\nwell-known national beverage of the Kirghises, Tartars and Kulmucks,\r\nnomads of Asiatic Russia who are famous horse breeders, whilst kephir\r\nis the native drink of the mountaineers of the Caucasus, the Ossetes,\r\nand some other tribes.\r\n\r\nIt has been supposed that the chief merit of kephir was that it was\r\nmore easy to digest than milk, as some of its casein is dissolved in\r\nthe process of fermentation. Kephir, in fact, was supposed to be partly\r\ndigested milk. This view has not been confirmed. Professor Hayem thinks\r\nthat the good effects of kephir are due to the presence of lactic acid\r\nwhich replaces the acid of the stomach and has an antiseptic effect.\r\nThe experiments of M. Rovighi, which I spoke of in _The Nature of Man_,\r\nhave confirmed the latter fact, which now may be taken as certain. The\r\naction of kephir in preventing intestinal putrefaction depends on the\r\nlactic acid bacilli which it contains.\r\n\r\nKephir, although in some cases certainly beneficial, cannot be\r\nrecommended for the prolonged use necessary if intestinal putrefaction\r\nis to be overcome. It is produced by combined lactic and alcoholic\r\nfermentations, and as it contains up to one per cent. of alcohol, its\r\nuse as a food for years would involve the absorption of considerable\r\nquantities of alcohol. The yeasts which produce it can be acclimatised\r\nin the human digestive tract, in which, however, they are harmful, as\r\nthey are favourable to the germs of infectious diseases such as the\r\nbacillus of typhoid fever, and the vibrio of Asiatic cholera.\r\n\r\nKephir has also the disadvantage that its flora varies considerably and\r\nis not well known. There has been little success in producing it by\r\npure cultures as would be necessary were it to be brought into general\r\nuse. When it is prepared from a dried remnant there is the risk of\r\nstray microbes being included, and these may bring about pernicious\r\nfermentations. Professor Hayem prohibits its use in the case of\r\npersons in whom food is retained for long in the stomach. “When it\r\nis retained in the stomach, kephir goes on fermenting, and there are\r\ndeveloped in the contents butyric and acetic acids which aggravate the\r\ndigestive disturbances.”[139]\r\n\r\nAs it is the lactic and not the alcoholic fermentation on which the\r\nvaluable properties of kephir depend, it is correct to replace it by\r\nsoured milk that contains either no alcohol or merely the smallest\r\ntraces of it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that so many races make soured milk and use it copiously is\r\nan excellent testimony to its usefulness. M. Nogueira has written\r\nto me to say how much he was astonished, on revisiting after a long\r\nperiod of absence the district of Mossamedes, to find the natives so\r\nwell preserved and displaying so few traces of senility. Dr. Lima has\r\nstated that amongst the natives of the region south of Angola “many\r\nindividuals of extraordinary longevity are to be found.” Although they\r\nare thin and withered, these old people are very active and can make\r\nlong journeys.\r\n\r\nMr. Wales, a lawyer at Binghampton, U.S.A., has been so good as to\r\nmake me acquainted with some extremely interesting facts taken from a\r\nwork by James Riley which is now a bibliographical rarity.[140] In the\r\nnarrative of a shipwreck of the vessel on which he made a voyage in\r\n1815, James Riley states that the wandering Arabs of the desert live\r\nalmost wholly on the milk of camels, fresh or soured.\r\n\r\nOn this diet they enjoy excellent health, display great vigour and\r\nreach advanced ages. Riley estimated that some of the old men must have\r\nlived for two to three hundred years. No doubt these figures are much\r\ntoo high, but it is probable that the Arabs Riley encountered lived\r\nreally unusually long.\r\n\r\nMr. Wales has examined Riley’s work critically, and is of the opinion\r\nthat that author was a well-informed, sagacious and conscientious\r\nobserver.\r\n\r\nM. Grigoroff, a Bulgarian student at Geneva, has been surprised by\r\nthe number of centenarians to be found in Bulgaria, a region in which\r\nyahourth, a soured milk, is the stable food. Some of the centenarians,\r\ndescribed by M. Chemin in his memoir, lived chiefly on a milk diet.\r\nMarie Priou, for example, who died in the Haute-Garonne in 1838 at the\r\nage of 158 years, had lived for the last ten years of her life entirely\r\non cheese and goat’s milk (_op. cit._ p. 100). Ambroise Jantet, a\r\nlabourer of Verdun, who died in 1751 at the age of 111 years, “ate\r\nnothing but unleavened bread and drank nothing but skimmed milk” (p.\r\n133). Nicole Marc, who died aged 110 years, at the chateau of Colemberg\r\n(Pas-de-Calais), a hunch-back and cripple, “lived only on bread and\r\nmilk-food. It was only towards the end of her life and after much\r\npersuasion that she took a little wine” (Chemin, p. 139).\r\n\r\nI owe to the kindness of M. Simine, an engineer in the Caucasus, the\r\nfollowing communication, taken from the newspaper _Tiflissky Listok_,\r\nOct. 8th, 1904. “In the village of Sba, in the district of Gori, there\r\nis an old Ossete woman, Thense Abalva, whose age is supposed to be\r\nabout 180 years (?). This woman is still quite capable and looks after\r\nher household duties and sews. Although she is bent, she walks firmly\r\nenough. Thense has never taken alcoholic liquors. She rises early in\r\nthe morning, and her chief food is barley bread and butter milk, taken\r\nafter the churning of the cream. Butter milk is a liquid containing\r\nvery many lactic microbes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jenny Read, an American, has written to me that her father,\r\neighty-four years old, “owes his health to the curdled milk which he\r\nhas taken for the last 40 years.”\r\n\r\nCurdled milk and the other products of milk to which I have referred\r\nare the work of the lactic microbes which produce lactic acid at the\r\nexpense of milk sugar. As many different kinds of soured milk have been\r\nconsumed on a vast scale and have proved to be useful, it might be\r\nsupposed that any of them is suitable for regular consumption with the\r\nobject of preventing intestinal putrefaction.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of flavour I find that soured milk, prepared\r\nfrom raw milk, is much the more agreeable. However, when a food is to\r\nbe selected for consumption during a long period of time, we must keep\r\nhygiene strictly in view. It is certain, therefore, that the Russian\r\n“prostokwacha,” as well as any other soured raw milk, must be rejected.\r\nRaw milk contains a large assortment of microbes, and frequently some\r\nof these are harmful. The bacillus of bovine tuberculosis, as well\r\nas other pernicious microbes, may be found in it. According to the\r\ninvestigations of Heim[141] the vibrios of Asiatic cholera, when placed\r\nin raw milk, survive even when the milk has become quite soured. In\r\nsimilar conditions the bacillus of typhoid fever remains alive for 35\r\ndays and dies only after it has been kept for 48 days in completely\r\nsoured milk.\r\n\r\nAs raw milk nearly always contains traces of fæcal matter from the\r\ncow, it sometimes happens that pernicious microbes are introduced from\r\nthat source, and remain alive notwithstanding the acid coagulation of\r\nthe milk. The lactic microbes certainly prevent the multiplication\r\nof other microbes, as, for instance, those of putrefaction, but are\r\nincapable of destroying them. Moreover, raw milk often contains fungi\r\n(yeasts, torulas, and oïdia) the presence of which is favourable to the\r\ndevelopment of such pernicious microbes as the cholera vibrio and the\r\nbacillus of typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nProlonged consumption of raw milk increases the risk of introducing\r\ndangerous microbes into the organism, and this possibility drives me to\r\nrecommend soured milk prepared after heating. Theoretically, it would\r\nbe best to sterilise the milk completely so that all the contained\r\nmicrobes would be destroyed. This, however, requires heating the milk\r\nto a temperature of from 226° to 248° Fahr., by which it acquires an\r\nunpleasant flavour. On the other hand, the pasteurising of milk at a\r\ntemperature of about 140° Fahr. is not sufficient to get rid entirely\r\nof the bacilli of tuberculosis and the spores of the butyric bacilli.\r\nWe have, therefore, to fall back on a middle course, and be content\r\nwith boiling the milk for several minutes. By so doing we certainly\r\nkill the tubercle bacilli and the spores of some of the butyric\r\nbacilli,[142] there being left only some butyric spores and the spores\r\nof _Bacillus subtilis_, to destroy which a much higher temperature is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nAs some kinds of soured milk, such as “varenetz,” “yahourth,” “leben,”\r\netc., are prepared from boiled milk, it might be supposed that\r\nthey fulfil the conditions necessary for prolonged use. A closer\r\nexamination, however, makes us reject them.\r\n\r\nBoiled milk, to make it undergo the lactic fermentation properly,\r\nmust have added to it a prepared ferment. What is necessary is not\r\nmerely rennet, as was formerly supposed, but a number of organised\r\nferments, that is to say, microbes. In the preparation of these soured\r\nmilks, a leaven is employed, one of the names of which is “Maya,”\r\nand which contains not only lactic microbes, but several others. MM.\r\nRist and Khoury[143] have come to the conclusion that the Egyptian\r\n“leben” contained a flora composed of five species, three of which\r\nare bacteria and two yeasts. The bacteria produce lactic acid and the\r\nyeasts alcohol. Although the result is that “leben” is a nearly solid\r\nsubstance, whilst kephir is a liquid, the two are closely similar.\r\nIn both cases we have to do with coincident lactic and alcoholic\r\nfermentations, and my remarks regarding kephir apply equally well to\r\nthe Egyptian “leben.”\r\n\r\nThrough the agency of Prof. Massol of Geneva, I have obtained a\r\nspecimen of the Bulgarian “yahourth.” Working with his pupil, M.\r\nGrigoroff, M. Massol[144] has isolated several microbes from this milk,\r\namongst these being a very active lactic bacillus. The same soured\r\nmilk has been studied in my laboratory by Drs. M. Cohendy[145] and\r\nMichelson. They found in it a very powerful lactic ferment, which has\r\nbeen named the Bulgarian bacillus. This was the microbe employed in the\r\nexperiments of M. Bélonowsky, to which I have already referred. More\r\nrecently, it has been carefully investigated from the chemical point of\r\nview by MM. G. Bertrand and Weisweiler[146] at the Pasteur Institute.\r\nIt proved to be an extremely active producer of lactic acid, supplying\r\n25 grammes per litre of milk. The other acids which this bacillus\r\nproduces, such as succinic and acetic acids, are formed only in very\r\nsmall quantities (about 50 centigrams a litre). Formic acid is produced\r\nonly in traces. On the other hand, the Bulgarian bacillus forms neither\r\nalcohol nor acetone, two frequent products of bacterial fermentation.\r\nThe bacillus also differs from other lactic ferments inasmuch as it\r\nhas no action on albuminoids (casein, etc.), nor on fats. All these\r\nqualities make the Bulgarian bacillus much the most useful of the\r\nmicrobes which can be acclimatised in the digestive tube for the\r\npurpose of arresting putrefactions and pernicious fermentations, such\r\nas the butyric fermentation.\r\n\r\nAs in all the known soured milks (yahourth, leben, prostokwacha,\r\nkephir, and koumiss) the lactic bacilli are associated with a rich\r\nflora in which pernicious microbes may be met (such as the red torula,\r\na microbe which predisposes to cholera and typhoid fever, which I found\r\nin the leaven of yahourth, bought in Paris), it is necessary to work\r\nout a method by which good curdled milk can be produced with the aid of\r\npure cultures of the lactic microbes.\r\n\r\nIt was the obvious course to begin with the Bulgarian bacillus, as\r\nthat is known to be the best producer of lactic acid. It coagulates\r\nmilk rapidly, giving it a strongly acid flavour, but it often also\r\ngives a disagreeable taste of tallow. It is true that after it has been\r\nkept for a long time in the laboratory in the form of pure cultures\r\nin sterilised milk, the bacillus loses to a large extent its power\r\nof saponifying fats, the taste of the curdled milk being then more\r\nagreeable. If necessary, therefore, soured milk prepared exclusively\r\nwith the Bulgarian bacillus can be used. In practice, however, it\r\nis useful to associate with it another lactic microbe, known as the\r\nparalactic bacillus, as the latter, although producing less lactic acid\r\nthan the Bulgarian bacillus, does not break up the fats and gives the\r\ncurdled milk a very pleasant flavour.\r\n\r\nAs it is undesirable to absorb too much fatty matter, it is necessary\r\nto prepare curdled milk for regular use from skimmed milk. After the\r\nmilk has been boiled and rapidly cooled, pure cultures of the lactic\r\nmicrobes are sown in it, in sufficient quantities to prevent the\r\ngermination of spores already in the milk and not destroyed in the\r\nprocess of boiling. The fermentation lasts a number of hours, varying\r\naccording to the temperature, and finally produces a sour curdled milk,\r\npleasant to the taste and active in preventing intestinal putrefaction.\r\nThis milk, taken daily in quantities of from 300 to 500 cubic\r\ncentimetres, controls the action of the intestine, and stimulates the\r\nkidneys favourably.[147] It can therefore be recommended in many cases\r\nof disorder of the digestive apparatus, of the kidneys, and in several\r\nskin diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian bacillus taken from yahourth or from soured milk,\r\nprepared from pure cultures of lactic microbes, can live in warm\r\ntemperatures, and, as has been shown by Dr. Cohendy, is able to take\r\nits place in the intestinal flora of man.\r\n\r\nSoured milk, prepared according to the receipt which I have given, has\r\nbeen analysed by M. Fouard, an assistant at the Pasteur Institute.\r\nWhen it was ready to be taken, M. Fouard found in it about 10 grammes\r\nof lactic acid per litre. Moreover, a large proportion (nearly\r\n38 per cent.) of the casein had been rendered soluble during the\r\nfermentation, which shows that its albuminous matter is prepared for\r\ndigestion much as in kephir. Of the phosphate of lime (which is the\r\nchief mineral substance of milk) 68 per cent. was rendered soluble\r\nduring the fermentation. These facts all confirm the utility of the\r\nsoured milk prepared from pure cultures of lactic bacteria.\r\n\r\nThose persons who, from some reason or other, cannot take milk, may\r\nswallow the bacilli in a pure culture without milk. However, as the\r\nmicrobes need sugar to produce lactic acid, it is necessary to take\r\nwith them a certain quantity of sweet food (jam, sweet-meats, and\r\nespecially beetroot).\r\n\r\nThe Bulgarian bacillus produces lactic acid not only from milk sugar,\r\nbut also from many other sugars, for instance, cane sugar, maltose,\r\nlevulose and especially glucose.\r\n\r\nCultures of the bacillus can be made not only in milk, but in vegetable\r\nbroths, or broths of animal peptone to which sugar has been added. The\r\ncultures can be taken in a dry form (powders or tabloids), or in the\r\nliquid in which the bacilli had themselves been developed.\r\n\r\nA reader who has little knowledge of such matters may be surprised\r\nby my recommendation to absorb large quantities of microbes, as the\r\ngeneral belief is that microbes are all harmful. This belief, however,\r\nis erroneous. There are many useful microbes, amongst which the lactic\r\nbacilli have an honourable place. Moreover, the attempt has already\r\nbeen made to cure certain diseases by the administration of cultures\r\nof bacteria. M. Brudzinsky[148] has used cultures of lactic microbes\r\nin certain intestinal diseases of infants, whilst Dr. Tissier[149] has\r\nused them in similar affections of infants and adults.\r\n\r\nFrom the general point of view of this book, the course recommended\r\nconsists of the absorption either of soured milk prepared by a group of\r\nlactic bacteria, or of pure cultures of the Bulgarian bacillus, but in\r\neach case taking at the same time a certain quantity of milk sugar or\r\nsaccharose.\r\n\r\nFor more than eight years I took, as a regular part of my diet, soured\r\nmilk at first prepared from boiled milk, inoculated with a lactic\r\nleaven. Since then, I have changed the method of preparation and have\r\nadopted finally the pure cultures which I have been describing. I am\r\nvery well pleased with the result, and I think that my experiment\r\nhas gone on long enough to justify my view. Several of my friends,\r\nsome of whom suffered from maladies of the intestine or kidneys, have\r\nfollowed my example, and have been well satisfied. I think, therefore,\r\nthat lactic bacteria can render a great service in the fight against\r\nintestinal putrefaction.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that our precocious and unhappy old age is due to\r\npoisoning of the tissues (the greater part of the poison coming from\r\nthe large intestine inhabited by numberless microbes), it is clear\r\nthat agents which arrest intestinal putrefaction must at the same time\r\npostpone and ameliorate old age. This theoretical view is confirmed by\r\nthe collection of facts regarding races which live chiefly on soured\r\nmilk, and amongst which great ages are common. However, in a question\r\nso important, the theory must be tested by direct observations. For\r\nthis purpose the numerous infirmaries for old people should be taken\r\nadvantage of, and systematic investigations should be made on the\r\nrelation of intestinal microbes to precocious old age, and on the\r\ninfluence of diets which prevent intestinal putrefaction in prolonging\r\nlife and maintaining the forces of the body. It can only be in the\r\nfuture, near or remote, that we shall obtain exact information upon\r\nwhat is one of the chief problems of humanity.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, those who wish to preserve their intelligence as\r\nlong as possible and to make their cycle of life as complete and as\r\nnormal as is possible under present conditions, must depend on general\r\nsobriety and on habits conforming to the rules of rational hygiene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V\r\n\r\nPSYCHICAL RUDIMENTS IN MAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nRUDIMENTARY ORGANS IN MAN\r\n\r\n  Reply to critics who deny the simian origin of\r\n  man—Actual existence of rudimentary organs—Reductions\r\n  in the structure of the organs of sense in man—Atrophy\r\n  of Jacobson’s organ and of the Harderian gland in the\r\n  human race\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral critics of _The Nature of Man_ have protested against my\r\ntheory of the simian origin of man. Some of these found my arguments\r\nunsatisfactory and unconvincing. Others have attacked generally my\r\nsuggestion that some anthropoid had been suddenly transformed to a\r\nprimitive human being.\r\n\r\nIt is true that so long as we have little palæontological evidence as\r\nto the actual descent of man, we cannot discuss the subject without\r\nthe aid of hypotheses. I think, however, that recent additions to\r\nknowledge confirm the theory of the descent of man in a way that ought\r\nto influence the most resolute opponents. I have in mind chiefly\r\nthe arguments supplied by the embryology of anthropoid apes, and by\r\nthe investigation of their blood. None the less, there are still\r\nmany authors who maintain their opposition. One of my critics, Dr.\r\nJousset,[150] enumerates certain differences in the structure of the\r\nskeleton in man and apes, and concludes that these radically separate\r\nman from apes.\r\n\r\nNo one has ever doubted that man was not identical in structure with\r\nthe anthropoid apes, or that he differs from them in several characters\r\nof the skeleton and of many other organs. The differences, however,\r\ndo not justify any radical separation of the two. The unusual length\r\nof arm, upon which my opponents throw so much weight, is in harmony\r\nwith the mode of life of apes, as these climb on trees and walk on all\r\nfour limbs. The difference between apes and Europeans in length of arm\r\nis certainly considerable, but is much less in the case of some lower\r\nraces, such as the Veddahs. In the Akkas of Central Africa, the arms\r\nare so long that the hands nearly reach the knees. The fœtus of\r\nEuropeans also shows an unusual length of arm, probably an ancestral\r\nfeature. It is only after birth that the arms become relatively shorter.\r\n\r\nAll the other characters different in man and the apes, are equally\r\nsecondary. On the other hand, just as apes differ amongst themselves,\r\nso also, the different races show differences often strongly marked.\r\nM. Michaelis,[151] in a comparative study of the muscular systems\r\nof monkeys, has made known many details of the musculature in the\r\norang-outan and the chimpanzee, and it appears from his investigations\r\nthat, although there are some differences between these two apes, they\r\nare both closely similar to man.\r\n\r\nThere are many variations in the muscular structure of man, and these\r\nfind parallels in the muscles of apes. This is also the case with other\r\nabnormalities of structure, some of which resemble the condition in\r\nmammals much lower than apes. An example of this is the presence of\r\nadditional pairs of nipples, arranged symmetrically on the sides of the\r\nchest and occasionally found in human beings. A similar abnormality\r\nhas been found in some monkeys, and the best explanation of such an\r\noccurrence is that monkeys, like man, are descended from mammals which\r\npossessed several pairs of mammary glands.\r\n\r\nThe large number of abnormalities and rudimentary organs which may\r\nbe found in man affords important evidence in favour of the descent\r\nof man from lower animals. Some authors, however, have tried to\r\ndispute this view and even deny the existence of rudimentary organs.\r\nM. Brettes,[152] amongst my opponents, has brought together most\r\nfacts upon this matter, with the object of proving that such organs\r\nfulfil some function indispensable to the body and bear witness to the\r\nexistence of a general plan of organisation. My opponent, however,\r\nconfines himself to general propositions, laying much stress on a law\r\nof “the subordination of organs” without proving that rudimentary\r\norgans have an actual function. In _The Nature of Man_ I remarked on\r\nthe uselessness of the wisdom teeth, which are not cut until long\r\nafter childhood and which are useless in mastication. In many human\r\nbeings these teeth never cut through the gum, and their absence is\r\nno disadvantage. This is a typical case of a rudimentary organ. To\r\nmaintain the contrary it would be necessary to prove that the wisdom\r\nteeth fulfil an indispensable function and that their absence was in\r\nsome way harmful to the organism. No one has been able to show this.\r\n\r\nThe mammary glands in males are another case of rudimentary organs. The\r\nfunction of these, of course, is well known in females, but it is only\r\nin the rarest cases that they are active in males.\r\n\r\nThe organs of sense supply many cases of rudimentary structures.\r\nAnimals which live in caves, in the dark, do not discern objects by\r\nsight, and in these cases the eyes are rudimentary. It is quite\r\nimpossible to deny the existence of rudimentary organs. They are\r\nextremely important guides to us in our investigation of the past\r\nhistory of the human race. The comparative study of the organs which\r\nare rudimentary in man and more or less well developed in lower animals\r\nis of fundamental importance in the problem of our origin.\r\n\r\nThe higher apes, or anthropoids, display reduction in some parts of\r\nthe organs of sense. The organ of smell, for instance, is much less\r\ndeveloped in them than in many other animals. Man has inherited the\r\nimperfect condition of this organ, and his sense of smell is much\r\nless developed than that of mammals which are lower in the scale of\r\nlife. Man, however, because of his intelligence, has been able to tame\r\ndomestic animals, such as dogs, ferrets, and pigs, and to make use\r\nof their acute sense of smell for tracking game or obtaining edible\r\nplants. The imperfect condition of the sense of smell in man in other\r\ncases is well replaced by his mental powers. He no longer recognises\r\nthe approach of an enemy by the sense of smell, in order that he may\r\ntake flight, because he has better means of defence than those of\r\nanimals. It is not surprising, therefore, that the olfactory apparatus\r\nof man is much reduced as compared with that of lower mammals. In apes\r\nand man the nasal region of the head is much smaller than in their\r\nmammalian ancestors, and in the deep-lying parts of the system there\r\nare corresponding differences. Most mammals, for instance, and the dog\r\nin particular, have four turbinal bones, the purpose of which is to\r\nincrease the surface of the mucous membrane of the nose, whilst in man\r\nthere are only three, one of which is rudimentary.\r\n\r\nThe olfactory apparatus in most mammals contains a well-developed\r\nportion known as the organ of Jacobson, the probable function of\r\nwhich is to appreciate the flavour of food in the mouth. In man, this\r\norgan is in a rudimentary condition and cannot fulfil its function,\r\nas it is devoid of its proper nerve. This remnant, now useless, gives\r\nus information as to the evolution of the organ of smell in man. In\r\nthe human fœtus, Jacobson’s organ is not only better developed than\r\nin adult man, but it is also provided with a stout nerve trunk, which\r\ndisappears towards the end of embryonic life. The organ, however,\r\ncannot perform any olfactory function. The human fœtus, moreover,\r\npossesses five turbinals which later on become reduced to three, and of\r\nthese only two develop completely.\r\n\r\nThe history of the evolution of the organ of smell, as it has been made\r\nout by comparative anatomy and embryology, links this apparatus in\r\nman with the corresponding organs of other mammals by means of these\r\nuseless rudiments, which, however, are important evidence in scientific\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nThe auditory apparatus also has become reduced in man. Many animals,\r\nin the struggle for existence, require a very acute sense of hearing,\r\nmore so than man or some of the most intelligent mammals. We have all\r\nseen how horses raise their ears to hear better when there is the\r\nslightest sound near them. Monkeys and man have lost this power, and\r\nman sometimes tries to supply the defect by artificial means. When a\r\nlecturer, for instance, is not speaking sufficiently loud some of the\r\naudience put their hands to their ears, making a kind of trumpet which\r\nserves to catch the sound. The human external ear is supplied with\r\nmuscles, but in most cases these are too feeble to move it. In very\r\nrare cases persons can move their ears, the muscles inserted to the\r\nshell in most of us being mere rudiments of those that existed in our\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nIn the organ of sight, the little fold in the inner angle of the eye,\r\nknown as the semilunar fold, is of special interest. This membrane\r\nis a useless vestige of a structure much better developed in lower\r\nmammals. In the dog it is present as a small third eyelid, supported\r\nby a special cartilage provided with a secreting gland, known as the\r\nHarderian gland. In birds, reptiles and frogs, the corresponding\r\nstructures are much better developed. Everyone has seen the delicate\r\nmembrane which, in the case of a bird, may shoot out from the inner\r\nangle of the eye and cover the whole of the exposed part of the eyeball\r\n(nictitating membrane). In these animals, the eye is protected by this\r\nthird lid, which has its own muscles. As in the dog, this third eyelid\r\nof birds and lower vertebrates is generally provided with a large\r\nHarderian gland, which produces a liquid secretion like tears.\r\n\r\nIn most monkeys, this apparatus is much reduced. Many of them have\r\nstill a small Harderian gland and a weak third eyelid. In man, as I\r\nhave already said, there are only vestiges of these organs, the gland\r\nbeing almost atrophied and the third eyelid represented only by an\r\ninsignificant crescentic fold. In the lower races the fold sometimes\r\ncontains a small cartilage. Giacomini found it twelve times in sixteen\r\nnegroes, whilst in 548 white people it was found only in three cases.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of these facts is not doubtful. This little fold is\r\nthe last vestige in use of an organ which was useful only in our remote\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nThe organs of reproduction in the human race also show a number of\r\nrudiments. There remain even traces of a hermaphrodite condition,\r\na very low degree of organisation, going back to extremely\r\nremote ancestors. The evidence given by the very large number of\r\nabnormalities that are found in these organs makes it clear that, in\r\nthe long period of the evolution of the human race, they have been\r\nsubjected to a series of modifications. Thus, for instance, there is\r\noccasionally present in women a form of uterus resembling that of the\r\nlower mammals, or even the double uterus of marsupials.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of man has been dominated by the great development of\r\nthe brain and of the intelligence, and man, accordingly, has lost many\r\norgans and functions which were of use in his more or less remote\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHUMAN TRAITS OF CHARACTER INHERITED FROM APES\r\n\r\n  The mental character of anthropoid apes—Their muscular\r\n  strength—Their expression of fear—The awakening of\r\n  latent instincts of man under the influence of fear\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts of which I have given a résumé serve to show that evolution\r\nalways leaves definite traces indicating its successive stages in\r\nthe form of rudiments. It is probable, therefore, that the pre-human\r\nmental functions or psycho-physiological qualities, which have so long\r\na history behind them, have also left more or less appreciable traces.\r\nThese, however, must be more difficult to find than rudimentary organs\r\nwhich can be made visible by dissection.\r\n\r\nIf we turn first to the animals most nearly related to man, we find\r\nthat the living anthropoid apes show in the clearest way their close\r\nrelationship with the human race, and suggest that their kinship with\r\nour remoter ancestors must be even greater.\r\n\r\nThe anthropoid apes alive to-day are animals inhabiting chiefly virgin\r\nforests, and feeding on fruits and shoots, although they do not despise\r\neggs or even little birds. To satisfy their wants, they climb with the\r\ngreatest ease. Orang-outans and chimpanzees climb slowly and carefully,\r\nwhilst gibbons show a greater agility and more perfect acrobatic power.\r\nThey may be seen throwing themselves from branch to branch across\r\nspaces of forty feet with the greatest precision. They play at the top\r\nof very tall trees, hardly grasping the branches through which they\r\npass, making leaps of from twelve to eighteen feet for hours together\r\nwith little apparent exertion.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the dexterity and swiftness of gibbons, Martin\r\ntook the case of a female which he observed in captivity. One time\r\nshe hurled herself from a perch across a space at least twelve feet\r\nwide, against a window which one would have thought would have been\r\nimmediately broken. To the great surprise of the spectators it was not\r\nbroken. The gibbon seized with her hands the narrow board between the\r\npanes, and then in an instant twisted herself round and jumped back to\r\nthe cage she had left, performing this manœuvre with great strength\r\nand the most marvellous precision.\r\n\r\nThe muscular force implied in the above narrative is possessed by all\r\nthe anthropoid apes. Battel, an English sailor who gave the first\r\ndescription of the gorilla in the beginning of the 17th century, stated\r\nthat the strength of that animal was so great that ten men could hardly\r\nmaster an adult specimen. The other anthropoids, although not so strong\r\nas the gorilla, nevertheless display surprising force.\r\n\r\nEdouard, the young male chimpanzee which I used in my experiments\r\non syphilis, struggled so much at the least touch that it took four\r\nmen to master him. I had to give up allowing him to leave his cage\r\nbecause there was no way of getting him back to it. Even quite young\r\nchimpanzees, females not yet two years old, cannot be handled easily.\r\nAlthough they are very friendly, my specimens used to resist with all\r\ntheir strength when it was necessary to put them back in their cages\r\nfor the night. Two men had much ado to shut them up.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great muscular force, the anthropoid apes are\r\ncowardly. They have no idea of their strength, but fly from the\r\napproach of the slightest imagined danger. My young chimpanzees,\r\nalthough their teeth and muscles were already formidable weapons,\r\nshowed the greatest fear when I put with them animals even so weak and\r\nharmless as guinea-pigs, pigeons and rabbits. Mice frightened them\r\nvery much at first, and it took them a considerable time before they\r\ngot over their fear of so insignificant an enemy. When living in a\r\nstate of nature the anthropoid apes scarcely ever assume the offensive.\r\n“Though possessed of immense strength,” wrote Huxley,[153] “it is rare\r\nfor the Orang to attempt to defend itself, especially when attacked\r\nwith fire-arms. On such occasions he endeavours to hide himself, or\r\nto escape along the topmost branches of the trees, breaking off and\r\nthrowing down the boughs as he goes.” Savage[154] wrote of chimpanzees\r\nthat “they do not appear ever to act on the offensive, and seldom,\r\nif ever really, on the defensive.” When a female was surprised on a\r\ntree with her young ones “her first impulse was to descend with great\r\nrapidity and make off into the thicket.”[155]\r\n\r\nThe gorilla, the strongest and most ferocious of the apes, has\r\nsometimes been observed to take the offensive. Savage, quoted by\r\nHuxley, said that “they are exceedingly ferocious, and always offensive\r\nin their habits, never running from man, as does the chimpanzee.\r\nThe females and young, at the first cry, quickly disappear. He (the\r\nmale) then approaches the enemy in great fury, pouring out his horrid\r\ncries in quick succession.”[156] Only males take the offensive,\r\nnor can this be of frequent occurrence, as one of the most recent\r\nobservers, Koppenfels,[157] states that “the gorilla never attacks man\r\nspontaneously; he tries to avoid him, and, as a rule, takes to flight\r\nas soon as he sees a man, uttering peculiar guttural cries.”\r\n\r\nWhich of these characters are preserved in the human race? Man is\r\nnaturally feebler and less of a gymnast than the great apes, but his\r\ndisposition is cowardly. One of the earliest signs of mental activity\r\nin an infant is the fear of surrounding circumstances. The smallest\r\nchange in its balance or its being put in a bath cause it to show\r\nsigns of real terror. Later on, it is alarmed when it sees any kind of\r\nanimal, exactly in the fashion of a young chimpanzee. The most harmless\r\nspider is enough to frighten it.\r\n\r\nAlthough mental culture subdues fear to a large extent, fear reveals\r\nitself more or less strongly from time to time, and it is on such\r\noccasions that we may find in the human being psychological relics of\r\nhis ancestors. An analysis of fear is of special interest.\r\n\r\nThe first result of the emotion of fear is flight. Consciousness of\r\ndanger sets our limbs in motion, and our instinctive desire to escape\r\ndisplays itself even when flight is more dangerous than what we wish\r\nto avoid. At the first alarm of fire in a public building, people rush\r\ntowards the exits and in so doing often perish from their wish to\r\nescape. Even in the extreme of terror, the desire of flight is one of\r\nthe earliest impulses. Mosso, a well-known Italian physiologist, in a\r\nmonograph on fear, relates that when a Calabrian brigand was sentenced\r\nto death “he uttered a sharp cry, heart-rending and terrible, looked\r\naround him as if he were eagerly seeking for something, and then\r\nstepped backwards as if to fly, and threw himself against the wall of\r\nthe court, writhing, with arms outstretched, scratching at the wall as\r\nif he were trying to break through it.”\r\n\r\nAlthough in such a case it was futile and often is harmful, the\r\ninstinct of flight from danger is inherited from ancestors from a\r\ntime when it served to save life. Attempts to escape are not the\r\nonly signs of fear. There is often a trembling fit which would make\r\nflight impossible. In Mosso’s case of the Calabrian brigand, “after\r\nhis struggles, cries and contortions, he fell on the ground in a\r\nmotionless heap, like a wet rag; he became pale and trembled more than\r\nI have seen any other person tremble; his muscles seemed changed into\r\na soft and quivering jelly.” This condition of trembling inertia is\r\nanother legacy from animals. Quivering of the muscles often manifests\r\nitself in terrified animals. Darwin[158] wrote of it, “trembling is of\r\nno service, often of much disservice, and cannot at first have been\r\nacquired through the will, and then rendered habitual in association\r\nwith any emotion.” The phenomenon seemed to him obscure and difficult\r\nto explain, a view shared by Mosso. The trembling of the musculature of\r\nthe body is a generalised and exaggerated form of the movements of the\r\ncutaneous muscles in the condition known popularly as “goose-skin.” The\r\nlatter, however, is a relic of an adaptation useful to some animals.\r\nThe hedgehog rarely takes to flight at the approach of danger, but\r\nstands still, and using strongly developed muscles, rolls itself into a\r\nball. In birds and many mammals, the muscles of the skin cause erection\r\nof the feathers or hairs. These movements often are performed during\r\nfright, and according to Darwin, serve not only to warm the skin,\r\nbut sometimes to make the animal appear larger and more terrifying to\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nFear and cold alike cause contraction of the superficial blood-vessels,\r\nand, in man, excite the contraction of the minute rudimentary muscles\r\ninserted to the roots of the hairs. “Goose-skin” is caused by the\r\ncontraction of these muscles, the condition being a functional\r\nrudiment, no longer serving to warm the skin nor to make the body\r\nappear larger. In a few exceptional cases, “goose-skin” can be produced\r\nvoluntarily. In the normal condition, the rudimentary cutaneous muscles\r\nof man are immobile, and it requires some special stimulation to set\r\nthem in action.\r\n\r\nFear, which is occasionally able to excite the contraction of the\r\ninvoluntary muscles, also stimulates other muscles against the will.\r\nUnder the influence of emotions that powerfully affect the nervous\r\nsystem, and particularly under that of fear, contractions of the\r\nbladder and intestines may be so violent that it is impossible to\r\nprevent the voiding of their contents. Accidents of this kind are not\r\ninfrequent in the case of youthful candidates at examinations. Mosso\r\nrelates of a friend, a volunteer in the war of 1866, that he was seized\r\nwith terror during a battle and that the utmost efforts of his will\r\nfailed to make his body endure the terrible spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe involuntary action of the bladder and intestines during fear is\r\na legacy from animals. The phenomenon is common in dogs and monkeys.\r\nChimpanzees, when laid hold of, discharge their urine and fæces. At\r\nMadeira I had an unusually cowardly _Cercopithecus_ monkey which when\r\nat all alarmed discharged the contents of the rectum. Quite possibly\r\nsuch a mechanism was useful for the preservation of the individual. The\r\nemission of various kinds of excretions is of use in the struggle for\r\nexistence. In that way the fox drives the badger from its earth and\r\ntakes possession of it, whilst polecats and skunks defend themselves\r\nagainst more powerful carnivorous animals by discharging on them\r\nfœtid secretions.\r\n\r\nInstinctive fear is therefore a very powerful stimulant, awakening\r\nfunctions which are rudimentary and almost completely extinct.\r\nSometimes it sets in operation mechanisms which have long been\r\nparalysed. Pausanias gives an example of a dumb young man who recovered\r\nhis speech when he was terrified by seeing a lion. Herodotus relates\r\nthat the son of Crœsus, who was dumb, on seeing a Persian about to\r\nkill his father, cried out: “You must not kill Crœsus,” and from\r\nthat time onwards was able to talk. These ancient narratives have been\r\nconfirmed by many modern observations. A woman, for instance, who had\r\nbeen dumb for several years, on seeing a fire, was terrified and cried\r\nout suddenly “Fire!” after which her speech was restored. Such are\r\ncases of the awakening of a function which has been arrested only for\r\nseveral years. But fear can bring into activity other mechanisms which\r\nhave been inactive from time immemorial.\r\n\r\nMany different kinds of animals can swim instinctively. This is true\r\nin the case of most birds and mammals. There are some species which\r\nshow a repugnance to water, but none the less swim well enough if they\r\nare thrown into it. Cats shun water as much as possible, but, none\r\nthe less, can swim quite easily. Historians relate that Hannibal had\r\ngreat difficulty in getting his elephants to cross the Rhone. Some\r\nfemales were ferried across first, upon which the other elephants threw\r\nthemselves into the water to pursue them and swam across the river\r\nwithout any difficulty (Lenthéric, _Le Rhône_, 1892, p. 81).\r\n\r\nThe lower monkeys can swim without being taught, but the anthropoid\r\napes have lost this power, and man also is without it. M. Volz[159]\r\nstates that the different species of gibbons which live in Sumatra are\r\nseparated by rivers. Their inability to swim makes these a complete\r\nbarrier. It is probable that the lower races, in this respect, are\r\nbetter endowed than we are. It is said that in the case of negroes,\r\nchildren run to the sea or to rivers almost as soon as they leave the\r\ncradle, and learn to swim almost as quickly as to walk.[160] In the\r\ncase of white people, many find it very difficult to learn to swim,\r\nand it is at least certain that swimming is not instinctive as in the\r\ncase of our animal ancestors. Christmann,[161] the author of a treatise\r\non swimming, states that the reason of man is a worse guide than the\r\ninfallible instinct of the animal. Fear is able to stifle reason and\r\nto allow the instinct to come into play. It is known that children or\r\nadults may be taught to swim by throwing them into the water. Under the\r\ninfluence of fear, the instinctive mechanism inherited from animals\r\nawakens, and man soon becomes a swimmer. There are some teachers of\r\nswimming who use this method successfully. I have myself known an\r\nindividual who learnt the art in that way, and M. Troubat, librarian at\r\nthe International Library, has informed me that one of his friends, a\r\njournalist who died at Noyon several years ago, bathed in the Seine one\r\nevening at Neuilly when he could not swim. Unexpectedly finding himself\r\nbeyond his depth, a sudden movement of fear saved him. Since then, he\r\nsaid, he knew how to swim.\r\n\r\nJust as there are cases in which terror provokes flight, and others in\r\nwhich it causes an arrest of motion, so also fear may do a disservice\r\nto a swimmer. Those who employ fear as a means of teaching to swim,\r\nknow that they must intervene if there is real danger. It is true, none\r\nthe less, that up to a certain point fear can awaken functions which\r\nhave been atrophied for numberless generations, and that we can learn\r\nfrom it something as to the evolution of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSOMNAMBULISM AND HYSTERIA AS MENTAL RELICS\r\n\r\n  Fear as the primary cause of hysteria—Natural\r\n  somnambulism—Doubling of personality—Some examples of\r\n  somnambulists—Analogy between somnambulism and the life\r\n  of anthropoid apes—The psychology of crowds—Importance\r\n  of the investigation of hysteria for the problem of the\r\n  origin of man\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of fear is interesting in other respects than those with\r\nwhich I have been dealing. It is also a primary cause of the obscure\r\nand complicated phenomena of hysteria.\r\n\r\nThus, for instance, amongst twenty-two hysterical women observed by\r\nGeorget[162] the primary causes were: terror, 13 cases; extreme grief,\r\n7 cases; extreme annoyance, one case. A patient of M. Pitres, of\r\nBordeaux, first exhibited hysteria after being extremely terrified. A\r\nman with a tame bear had come to the village. The patient went to see\r\nthe performance and elbowed her way through the crowd until she got\r\nto the front row. The bear, whilst dancing, passed so close that its\r\ncold muzzle touched the cheek of the young girl. Marie—for that was\r\nthe patient’s name—was terrified. She ran quickly home, and almost\r\non her arrival fell on her bed in an attack of convulsion and extreme\r\ndelirium. Since then the attacks have been repeated many times, and the\r\ndelirium associated with them always turns upon the terror caused by\r\nthe bear touching her.\r\n\r\nA hysterical woman at the Salpétrière is haunted by terrifying dreams.\r\nShe thinks someone is trying to murder her, or to cut her throat, or\r\nthat she is falling into water, and she keeps crying for help.[163]\r\n\r\nSome of the most curious phases of hysteria are the paradoxical and\r\nextraordinary cases of so-called natural somnambulism, in which the\r\npatients, whilst asleep, perform all sorts of acts of which they\r\nremember nothing in their waking hours. Cases of duplication of\r\npersonality are also known, in which the patients live in two different\r\nstates without, in one of these, having the slightest remembrance of\r\nwhat takes place in the other. One of the most curious observations was\r\nthat of the somnambulist who became _enceinte_ whilst in her second\r\nstate. In her first, or normal condition, she was ignorant of the\r\nreason of her physical changes, although in the second state she knew\r\nabout it quite well and spoke freely of it (Pitres, _op. cit._ II, 215).\r\n\r\nIn the state of natural somnambulism the patients generally reproduce\r\nthe normal acts of their daily life which they have acquired the habit\r\nof performing unconsciously. Artisans devote themselves to their manual\r\nwork, sempstresses begin to sew, maid servants brush shoes or clothes,\r\nlay the table and so forth. Educated persons devote themselves to\r\nintellectual work to which they are accustomed. Clergymen have been\r\nknown to compose their sermons in the somnambulistic condition, and to\r\nread them over to correct mistakes in style or in spelling.\r\n\r\nHowever, besides somnambulists who during slumber simply repeat the\r\nusual acts of their life, there are others who do special things to\r\nwhich they are unaccustomed.\r\n\r\nIt is these cases which are most interesting from my point of view.\r\nI shall take one case which has been specially well reported. A\r\nhysterical patient, a girl of 24 years of age, was admitted as an\r\nin-patient to the hospital Laënnec. One Sunday, she got up about one\r\no’clock in the morning. The night watchman, who was alarmed, went for\r\nthe night doctor, who witnessed the following scene. “The patient went\r\nto the staircase leading to the nurses’ quarters, then suddenly turned\r\nround and walked towards the wash-house. The door of that being closed,\r\nshe then groped for a time and turned towards the women’s dormitory\r\nin which she had formerly slept. She went up to the top of the house\r\nwhere this dormitory was, and when she got on the landing, opened a\r\nwindow leading to the roof, went out of the window, walked along the\r\ngutter, under the horrified eyes of the nurse who followed her and who\r\ndid not dare to speak to her, went in again by another window and went\r\ndown the stairs.” “It was at this moment that I saw her,” said the\r\nnight doctor; “she was walking noiselessly, her gait was automatic, her\r\narms hanging by her sides, a little bent, the head erect and fixed,\r\nher hair disordered, her eyes wide open; she seemed like some strange\r\napparition.”[164] This is obviously the case of a hysterical subject,\r\nwho in a normal condition was not accustomed to climb upon roofs and\r\nwalk along the gutters.\r\n\r\nAnother observation, reported by Charcot, related to a young man,\r\nseventeen years old, the son of a large manufacturer, and of good\r\naddress. Tired out by working for his final examination, he had gone\r\nto bed early. Some time later he rose from the bed in his college\r\ndormitory, went out by a window, and without accident climbed on the\r\nroof and took a long and dangerous walk along the gutters. He was\r\nawakened before any accident occurred (Feinkind, p. 70).\r\n\r\nA case observed by Dr. Mesnet and M. Mottet was still more interesting.\r\nA lady thirty years old and extremely hysterical got out of bed in the\r\nnight, “dressed herself, completed her toilet without help, removed the\r\nfurniture in her way without stumbling against it. She was indifferent\r\nand idle by day, but strenuous at night in performing the most varied\r\nacts. I have seen her walking about in her rooms, opening doors, going\r\ndown to the garden, leaping on seats with the utmost agility, running\r\nabout, in fact doing all these things much better than in her waking\r\nhours, in which she got about only slowly and with aid” (Feinkind, p.\r\n84).\r\n\r\nHorst has related an extraordinary incident which took place in the\r\nsixteenth century. “A soldier walked in his sleep to a window, and with\r\nthe help of a rope climbed a high tower, secured a jackdaw’s nest with\r\nits young birds, and regained his bed, where he remained asleep until\r\nthe morning.”[165] Unfortunately there are not sufficiently detailed\r\nfacts regarding this incident, and for fully described cases we must\r\nreturn to modern times. Dr. Guinon has related one case in ample\r\ndetail. A man thirty-four years of age, by occupation an interpreter,\r\nwas taken into hospital for hysterical attacks. “One night soon after\r\nhe came under the care of the physicians, this patient, towards one\r\no’clock in the morning, suddenly arose from bed, threw open a window\r\nand jumped across the sill into the courtyard of the hospital. The\r\nattendants on duty ran after him, and saw him hurrying away, undressed\r\nand carrying a pillow in his arms. He traversed a series of gardens\r\nand walks, with the topography of which he was unacquainted, climbed a\r\nladder and got on the roof of the hydrotherapeutic establishment, up\r\nand down which he proceeded to run with the greatest agility. Sometimes\r\nhe stopped in his flight and rocked the pillow he was carrying, kissing\r\nand soothing it as if it were a child. Then he retraced the route he\r\nhad taken.” On being questioned next morning, he had not the faintest\r\nremembrance of his nocturnal exploit. “A similar fit came on him five\r\nor six times” (Feinkind, p. 108).\r\n\r\nThe same patient, “after having turned over in bed several times,\r\nseized a pillow and held it to his breast. He then got out of bed,\r\nand, in his nightgown, ran through the dormitory to a door leading to\r\nthe lavatories. He opened the door, readily but with violence, and\r\nentered one of the closets. Then, still holding the pillow against his\r\nchest with one arm, by a gymnastic feat both difficult and dangerous,\r\nyet which he performed with the utmost precision, using his feet and\r\nthe free arm, he got hold of the edge of the frame of an open window,\r\nthrough which he swung himself to the sill, alighting on both feet,\r\nafter which, preserving the pillow carefully from contact or shocks,\r\nhe jumped to the ground (the infirmary ward was on the ground floor).\r\nHe then ran quickly to the opposite corner of the courtyard, passing\r\nthe whole length of the great building at full speed, holding the\r\npillow carefully. By a path which led round the building, he reached a\r\ncorner where there was a tower supporting a great water-tank. A kind of\r\nmetallic ladder, placed almost vertically and with rounded steps, led\r\nup the side of the tower to a sort of observation-landing which at one\r\npoint was adjacent to the edge of the roof of the bath-house.\r\n\r\n“The patient set himself to climb this ladder without any hesitation,\r\nholding on by his free hand and placing his naked feet on the rounded\r\nsteps with extreme precision. When he reached the nearest point to\r\nthe roof of the bath-house he leapt upon that, and at a running pace\r\nclimbed the zinc roof to the crest, looking round him from time to time\r\nto see if his imaginary pursuers were near. He ran along the crest\r\nwhich was so narrow that his feet had to be placed alternately on\r\neither side on the slopes of the steep-pitched roof, a performance so\r\ndangerous that none of the officials would follow him, and which none\r\nthe less he performed with complete assurance and without a single slip.\r\n\r\n“When he reached the middle of the building he sat down on the crest\r\nof the roof, leaning against a ventilating chimney. He then took the\r\npillow which he had been carrying carefully, placed it on his knees\r\nwith a corner against his shoulder, and began to rock it as if it\r\nwere a child, crooning to it, stroking it with his hand or with his\r\ncheek that he pressed gently against the corner. From time to time his\r\neyebrows contracted and his looks hardened, and he gazed around him as\r\nif he were being pursued or watched, then gave a growl of rage, and\r\ntook to flight again, carrying the pillow on his dangerous path. All\r\nthe time he kept speaking, but we could not hear what he said. He saw\r\nnothing that was not in his dream; he did not understand when his name\r\nwas called aloud; but he could hear, for at the slightest sound near\r\nhim he rushed off again as if his pursuers were upon him. This episode\r\nlasted about two hours, during which he had climbed over all the roofs\r\nin the vicinity, defying our pursuit of him” (Feinkind, pp. 106-112).\r\n\r\nI could give other similar cases, but I think that I have shown\r\nsufficiently that man, when in the condition of natural somnambulism,\r\nexhibits qualities that he does not possess in the normal state,\r\nbecoming strong, adroit, and a good gymnast, like his anthropoid\r\nancestors. The close resemblance between the manœuvres of Martin’s\r\ngibbon, which I described earlier in this chapter, and the dangerous\r\nexploits of some sleep walkers is most striking.\r\n\r\nThe impulses to climb on roofs and poles, to run along in rain gutters,\r\nto climb a tower to take a bird’s nest, are characteristic examples of\r\nthe instinctive actions of climbing animals, like the anthropoid apes.\r\nDr. Barth[166] defines somnambulism as “a dream with exaltation of the\r\nmemory and automatic action of the nervous centres, without voluntary\r\nand conscious control.” “The striking exaltation of the memory is the\r\ndominating condition. The extreme exactness of the memory of places\r\ndisplayed by the somnambulist makes us understand how he performs\r\nhis nocturnal wanderings, doing almost without the aid of his senses\r\nnumberless deeds of which he would be practically incapable in a\r\nwaking condition.” However, as such a patient performs new acts which\r\nhe has never accomplished before in his own individual life, we must\r\nsuppose that the exaltation of memory includes extremely ancient facts,\r\ndating perhaps from the pre-human period. Man has inherited from his\r\nancestors a number of mechanisms of the brain, the activity of which\r\nis inhibited by restraints which have been developed later. Just as\r\nman possesses mammary glands which under ordinary conditions cannot\r\nsecrete milk, so also, in his brain, there are contained groups of\r\ncells which are inactive in the normal condition, but, also, just as in\r\nsome exceptional cases man and the males of several species of mammals\r\nare able to give milk, so also in abnormal conditions the atrophied\r\nmechanisms of other nervous centres begin to act.\r\n\r\nThe secretion of milk by males is a return to an extremely ancient\r\ncondition in which both sexes were able to nourish the young; so, also,\r\nthe gymnastic feats and the extraordinary strength of somnambulists are\r\na return to a normal condition much less remote from us than lactation\r\nin males.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to find that, in some cases, natural somnambulism\r\nis associated with power to move the shell of the ear. I know two\r\nbrothers, who, when they were young, used to walk in their sleep in\r\nthe most typical way. One of them, a chemist, used to climb on a high\r\ncupboard, or simply walk about in the room. The other brother, a\r\nsailor, in a fit of somnambulism, climbed to the top mast of a sailing\r\nship. These brothers, who were somnambulists, had the cutaneous muscles\r\nextremely well developed and were able to move their ears voluntarily.\r\n\r\nIn this case the abnormality was hereditary in the family, and the\r\ntwo daughters of one of the brothers were also somnambulistic and had\r\ncontrol over the muscles of the ears. Here, then, is a case of the\r\nsimultaneous recurrence of two characters of our ancestors: mobility\r\nof the ear and agility in gymnastic feats. M. Barth characterises the\r\nsomnambulist as “a living automaton in whom conscious will is for the\r\ntime being destroyed.” According to him, the somnambulist “acts at\r\nthe suggestion of circumstances, and what seem most extraordinary in\r\nwhat he does are in reality instinctive reactions.” This description\r\nagrees well with my view that in natural somnambulism the instincts\r\nof our pre-human ancestors are awakened, instincts which under normal\r\nconditions are latent and rudimentary.\r\n\r\nSometimes, under the stimulus of fear, the instinctive mechanism of\r\nswimming is awakened in man. It would be extremely interesting to know\r\nif a similar occurrence took place in somnambulists. I have been unable\r\nto find in literature any sufficient facts upon this subject. I can\r\nquote only one case, and that with all reserve, which was published\r\nin the article “Somnambulism” in the _Dictionnaire des Sciences\r\nMédicales_. “It is related that a somnambulist who took to swimming\r\nduring one of his fits was called by his name several times, and became\r\nso frightened when he awoke that he was drowned.” It would be extremely\r\ninteresting to collect more numerous facts on the instincts shown by\r\nsomnambulists.\r\n\r\nI have given a good deal of attention to natural somnambulism with\r\nthe idea that I should find in it traits recalling those of the life\r\nof anthropoid apes. I think that the extremely varied phenomena of\r\nhysteria could supply us with other facts, useful in investigating\r\nthe psycho-physiological history of man. Perhaps some of the facts of\r\nso-called “lucidity” which are well established could be explained\r\nas the awakening of special sensations atrophied in the human race,\r\nbut present in animals. It is known that in vertebrate anatomy organs\r\nare found which have the structures of organs of sense, but which are\r\nabsent or quite rudimentary in the human body. On the other hand,\r\nit is known that animals perceive some phenomena of the surrounding\r\nworld, for the perception of which man has no organs of sense. Fish,\r\nfor instance, appreciate gradations in the depth of water, birds and\r\nmammals have a sense of orientation and can anticipate changes in the\r\nweather more exactly than our meteorological science. When under the\r\ninfluence of hysteria, man may possibly be able to recover these senses\r\nof our remote ancestors, and to know things of which he is ignorant in\r\nthe normal condition.\r\n\r\nHysteria is common to man and animals. Amongst the numerous chimpanzees\r\nwhich I have owned, several have shown signs of hysteria. Some,\r\nwhen they were in the slightest degree annoyed, lay on the ground,\r\nscreaming terribly, and rolling about like children in a fit of\r\npassion. One young chimpanzee used to pull out its hair when it was in\r\na fit of temper. The view that hysteria is a relapse to the condition\r\nof our animal ancestors is supported by the conception of hysterical\r\nphenomena, suggested by Dr. Babinsky.[167] This well-known neurologist\r\nthinks that “the phenomena of hysteria have two special characters,\r\nthe one being that they can be reproduced by suggestion in some cases\r\nwith the most complete fidelity, and the other that they can disappear\r\nunder the sole influence of persuasion.” M. Babinsky thinks that “the\r\nhysteric patient is neither unconscious nor completely conscious, but\r\nis in a state of special consciousness.” In my opinion the latter\r\ncondition corresponds to the state of mind of our more or less remote\r\nancestors.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a man, under some sudden impulse, falls into a condition\r\nof extreme violence, and, being unable to control himself, commits\r\nacts of which he repents immediately afterwards. It is the custom to\r\nsay that at such times the brute has awakened in the man. This is\r\nmore than a metaphor. (Probably some nervous mechanism from a remote\r\nancestor has come into action, at the call of some stimulation.) As our\r\nanthropoid ancestors and primitive man lived in tribes, it is natural\r\nthat when men are grouped together, certain savage instincts should\r\nawaken. In this connection it is interesting to study the psychology\r\nof crowds. When man is surrounded by a great many of his fellows,\r\nhe becomes particularly responsive to suggestion. This condition is\r\ncharacterised as follows by M. G. Le Bon,[168] the author of a study\r\non the psychology of crowds: “The most careful observations seem to\r\nprove that an individual immerged for some length of time in a crowd\r\nin action soon finds himself—either in consequence of the magnetic\r\ninfluence given out by the crowd, or from some other cause of which we\r\nare ignorant—in a special state, which much resembles the state of\r\nfascination in which the hypnotised individual finds himself in the\r\nhands of the hypnotiser. The activity of the brain being paralysed\r\nin the case of the hypnotised subject, the latter becomes the slave\r\nof all the unconscious activities of his spinal cord, which the\r\nhypnotiser directs at will. The conscious personality has entirely\r\nvanished; will and discernment are lost. All feelings and thoughts\r\nare bent in the direction determined by the hypnotiser” (p. 11). Man,\r\nunder the influence of the crowd, gets into a condition like that of\r\na hysterical patient and displays a state of mind identical with that\r\nof our ancestors. “Moreover, by the mere fact that he forms part of\r\nan organised crowd, a man descends several rungs in the ladder of\r\ncivilisation. Isolated, he may be a cultivated individual; in a crowd,\r\nhe is a barbarian—that is, a creature acting by instinct” (p. 13).\r\n\r\nIt is quite natural to find relics of our prehistoric past in all kinds\r\nof hysterical phenomena. We could reach extremely interesting facts\r\nregarding the tribal and sexual life of apes, if we tried to compare\r\nwith them the phenomena of human hysteria. The passionate gestures\r\nwhich are characteristic of some hysterical cases could probably be\r\nexplained in this way quite simply, and the wild cries uttered by\r\npatients in acute hysteria would be similarly explicable.\r\n\r\nI think that just as anatomists seek for points of comparison between\r\nman and animals, as palæontologists make excavations to discover the\r\nburied remains of creatures intermediate between man and apes, so\r\nalso, psychologists and doctors should investigate the rudimentary\r\npsycho-physical functions with the object of building up the history of\r\nthe evolution of our psychical life. It cannot be doubted that in this\r\nbranch of science new arguments would be found to support the already\r\nwell founded theory of the simian origin of the human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VI\r\n\r\nSOME POINTS IN THE HISTORY OF SOCIAL ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE INDIVIDUAL AND THE RACE\r\n\r\n  Problem of the species in the human race—Loss\r\n  of individuality in the associations of lower\r\n  animals—Myxomycetes and Siphonophora—Individuality in\r\n  Ascidians—Progress in the development of the individual\r\n  living in a society\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the following pages I shall try to reply to the criticism on _The\r\nNature of Man_ that in that book I only considered the individual\r\nwithout thinking of the interests of society or of the race. I have\r\nbeen reproached for having lost sight of the truth that in the general\r\ncourse of evolution the interests of the individual must yield to the\r\nhigher interests of the community. It was asserted, in fact, that by\r\nadvising orthobiosis, that is to say, the most complete cycle of human\r\nlife, ending in extreme old age, I was suggesting something to the\r\ndetriment of humanity as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis objection rests on a misunderstanding which it will be interesting\r\nto clear up. I think that the complete development of the individual\r\nnot only would not injure the community but would be of great advantage\r\nto it. Moreover, we must not lose sight of the fact that the individual\r\nhas rights which must not be ignored.\r\n\r\nIn the attack on my theory many facts were brought forward which show\r\nthat in the animal and vegetable kingdoms the individual is always\r\nsacrificed to the advantage of the race. There is no doubt as to this,\r\nand in the course of this book I have given exact facts bearing on it.\r\nI instanced plants such as the Agave and some Cryptogams which die as\r\nsoon as they have reproduced; I have also spoken of the small female\r\nround worms (_Nematoda_) which are brutally torn in pieces and devoured\r\nby their progeny. It would be difficult to find better cases of the\r\nsacrifice of the individual to the species. The rule, however, does not\r\napply to man, who, in this respect, stands in a special position.\r\n\r\nSince the arrival of man, several species of animals have disappeared\r\nfrom the earth. Man has played a large part in the destruction of the\r\nMoa (_Aepyornis_) of Madagascar, the largest member of the class of\r\nbirds. He destroyed the Dodo of the Island of Mauritius and Steller’s\r\nsea cow (_Rhytina stelleri_), a harmless relative of the Manatee, from\r\nthe shores of the Aleutian Archipelago. Man is about to cause the\r\nextinction of several species of harmful carnivorous animals, such\r\nas the wolf and the bear, and possibly it will not be long before\r\nautomobiles have replaced the horse, which would then become extremely\r\nrare. However, although he has destroyed so many other species, man has\r\ntaken good care of himself. The progress already made by civilisation\r\nhas considerably reduced our mortality. Every year, a large number\r\nof young infants are kept alive by the aid of hygiene and medicine.\r\nThe decrease of war and of assassination has also played a part in\r\nmaintaining the race. The position which man has acquired in the world\r\nmakes it more likely that what we have to fear is too great an increase\r\nof population, and although the theory of Malthus has not been\r\nverified in all its details, it is still true that man could multiply\r\non the face of the earth too abundantly. It is already clear that\r\nalmost in the proportion that humanity stops the effusion of its blood\r\nin war, it tends to limit the propagation of the race.\r\n\r\nAs the future of the species seems to be safe, it is natural to\r\nconsider in the first place that of the individual. In this respect the\r\nfacts of general biology are of special interest.\r\n\r\nMan is not the only social animal on the earth. Long before his\r\nappearance other living beings existed in organised societies.\r\nThe splendid colonies of Siphonophora float on the surface of the\r\nseas, whilst in the ocean depths there are societies of corals of\r\nextraordinary variability, whilst again, on land, many kinds of insects\r\nlive in highly organised societies.\r\n\r\nThis social life has been developed without external assistance, and\r\nwithout any code to regulate the conduct of the individuals united for\r\na common purpose.\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to give a slight survey of the fundamental\r\nprinciples of such societies; I intend to draw special attention to\r\none of the essential points in the societies of animals, hoping to\r\nelucidate the relations between the individuals and society.\r\n\r\nIn the organisation of human society the most difficult points are\r\nthe extent to which the society may encroach on the individual and\r\nthe degree to which the individual may preserve his rights and his\r\nindependence. Disputes on these have been interminable, and I do not\r\npropose to discuss the theories according to which an individual must\r\nbe sacrificed for the good of the community to which he belongs.\r\nI shall limit myself to reviewing the fate of the individuals in\r\nsocieties of beings much inferior to man.\r\n\r\nThere are examples of societies composed of many individuals, even\r\namongst living things on the borderland between the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Isolated individuals of a Myxomycete.\r\n\r\n(After Zopff.)\r\n\r\n_a_, spore; _b-f_, escape of the zoospores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Myxomycete individuals united to form a\r\nplasmodium.\r\n\r\n(After Zopff.)]\r\n\r\nThere may be found in woods, on dead leaves or on decaying timber,\r\nminute plants resembling tiny mushrooms. These are Myxomycetes, and\r\nthe visible portions are minute sacs filled with microscopical rounded\r\nbodies, known as spores. When one of the spores is moistened, there\r\nemerges a minute organism with a mobile appendage by which it can be\r\nimpelled through water. A drop of water on a leaf or on a fragment of\r\ntimber may be filled with numbers of these tiny swimming bodies (Fig.\r\n21). Their free life as individuals, however, is of brief duration.\r\nWhen they come into contact, their bodies fuse, forming a gelatinous\r\nmass which may be quite large (Fig. 22). This mass is called a\r\nplasmodium, and is composed of a living substance which can move slowly\r\nover leaves and which exhibits streaming movements in the interior, so\r\nthat the whole resembles in some respects the lava from a volcano.\r\n\r\nThe plasmodia may be regarded as societies in the constitution of which\r\nthe individuality of the members has been completely sacrificed. The\r\nideal of those philosophers who have urged that man should renounce\r\nhis individuality and merge himself in the community has been realised\r\nin the fullest way at the lower end of the scale of life, at an epoch\r\ninconceivably remote from the appearance of the human race.\r\n\r\nAmongst animals, even the most lowly, there are no societies in which\r\nthe members are sacrificed so completely to the whole. Individuality\r\nis always preserved to a greater or lesser extent. Consider the\r\npolyps, colonies of which form reefs in the sea and may even become\r\nislands. These creatures live in aggregations, the members of which\r\nare incapable of living an independent life. They are united by living\r\nsubstance and resemble double monsters, such as Doodica and Radica, who\r\nwere so much talked of some years ago when M. Doyen operated upon them.\r\nThe peritoneal cavities of these twins were in free communication,\r\nand the blood-vessels were united so that the blood of the one passed\r\nfreely into the body of the other. In another double monster, the two\r\nTscheck girls, Rosa and Josepha, the intestinal tracts communicate,\r\nboth leading to a common rectum. In these, who are still alive, the\r\nperitoneum is joined and there is a single urethra.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the coral polyps, the fusion of the individuals of the\r\ncolony is nearly always much more complete. Each individual has its\r\nown mouth and stomach, whilst the other organs cannot be assigned to\r\nindividuals but must be regarded as common to the whole.\r\n\r\nIn the swimming polyps or Siphonophora, the loss of individuality\r\nis still more remarkable. These graceful and transparent creatures,\r\nsometimes large in size, live in the sea and may appear on its\r\nsurface in great numbers. They possess many whip-like filaments\r\nprovided with tentacles, swimming bells and stomachs. There can be\r\nno doubt as to their colonial nature (Fig. 23), but it is difficult\r\nto decide as to whether each piece of the colony, each swimming\r\nbell, stomach and so forth, is to be regarded as an individual or\r\nan organ, different zoologists having taken different views on the\r\nquestion. One interpretation is that colonial life has brought with\r\nit such modifications that of each individual there remains only a\r\nsingle organ. Some individuals have been reduced to simple stomachs,\r\nattached to the central stem, whilst others have lost all organs\r\nexcept that of locomotion which has become one of the swimming bells\r\nof the colony. Other zoologists, and I myself amongst them, think\r\nthat the Siphonophora are colonies of organs in which there has been\r\nas yet practically no development of individuality. A living chain of\r\nSiphonophora is simply a number of organs such as stomachs, tentacles,\r\nswimming bells and so forth, united on a common stem. I need not\r\ndiscuss the disputed point further, for the only matter pertinent to\r\nmy argument is that in the Siphonophora the loss of individuality,\r\nthe sacrifice of the parts to the whole, is not so great as in the\r\nMyxomycetes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—One of the Siphonophora.\r\n\r\n(After Chun.)\r\n\r\n_pn_, pneumatic chamber; _clh_, swimming bells; _stl_, stolon.]\r\n\r\nIn support of my view, I must recall the small forms of Siphonophora\r\nknown as _Eudoxia_. These are detached pieces of the common trunk\r\nwhich swim freely in the sea and have a remarkable structure (Fig.\r\n24). Their mobility is due to a bell provided with strong muscular\r\nfibres. The bell is a portion of an individual which possesses organs\r\nof reproduction but which is devoid of the means to capture or digest\r\nfood. These two functions are performed by a second individual which\r\nis closely united with the first. The nutrient individual has a long\r\ntentacle by which the prey is captured, and a capacious stomach in\r\nwhich it is digested. The products of digestion pass by channels into\r\nthe reproductive individual, carrying as it were a ready-made blood.\r\n_Eudoxia_ in fact is a double being composed of an individual incapable\r\nof locomotion or of reproduction, but adapted for prehension and\r\ndigestion, and of a second individual which can reproduce and which is\r\nmobile. _Eudoxia_ is an association resembling that of the blind man\r\nand the paralytic, in Florian’s fable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—_Eudoxia._\r\n\r\n(After Chun.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—_Botryllus_ colonies.\r\n\r\n_o_, mouth ; _A_, common cloaca.]\r\n\r\nAdvance in the organisation of social animals is plainly incompatible\r\nwith complete loss of individuality, and this becomes the more apparent\r\nthe higher we reach in the scale of life. In the social Ascidians,\r\neach member retains all the organs necessary to life. Animals of the\r\ngenus _Botryllus_ (Fig. 25), perhaps the most interesting of these\r\nAscidians, occur in the form of circular colonies. The individuals\r\nwhich compose the colony are grouped radially around a common centre\r\nwhich is occupied by the cloaca. Each individual has its own mouth\r\nand digestive tube, but the latter opens into a cloaca, common to all\r\nthe individuals, by which the excreta are voided. There is, in fact,\r\na single anus, as in the case of Rosa and Josepha which I have just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nINSECT SOCIETIES\r\n\r\n  Social life of insects—Development and preservation of\r\n  individuality in colonies of insects—Division of labour\r\n  and sacrifice of individuality in some insects\r\n\r\n\r\nHitherto I have dealt with associations of animals the members of\r\nwhich are linked by an actual material bond. In the insect world there\r\nare many cases of highly developed colonies. But the organisation of\r\ninsects is high, and is incompatible with the existence of actual\r\nphysical connection between the members of the society.\r\n\r\nIn early stages of the development of the social instinct in bees,\r\nfully formed and similar individuals join together with the object\r\nof securing the safety of their individual lives. Sometimes they act\r\ntogether to drive away a common enemy, sometimes, as in winter, they\r\ncling in a mass to maintain their temperature. In such primitive\r\nsocieties, the young are not reared in common. It is only in much more\r\nhighly developed colonies, such as those of some bees and wasps, and of\r\nants and termites, that the chief object of the common action is care\r\nof the progeny. Such an extreme development of the colony is attained\r\nonly by sacrificing the individuality of the members. There is a\r\nfar-reaching division of labour, so that the queens, for instance, are\r\nmere machines for laying eggs. In hive-bees the queen can no longer\r\njudge of what is good for the colony, her intellectual functions being\r\ndegenerate. She is enclosed in her cell and supported by the workers,\r\nwho see in her the future of the race. In times of want the worker-bees\r\nsacrifice their own lives and give the queen the last remnants of\r\nthe food-supply so that she survives them. The males are incomplete\r\nindividuals and are tolerated only so long as they are required, after\r\nwhich the workers kill them remorselessly.\r\n\r\nThe workers, which take such pains for the well-being of the hive,\r\nare incomplete individuals. Their brains are well developed and they\r\nare well equipped with organs for making wax and collecting food, but\r\ntheir reproductive organs are reduced to mere vestiges incapable of\r\nfulfilling their functions.\r\n\r\nHere then is a case of loss of individual characters increasing with\r\nthe perfection of the colony. Amongst ants and termites, the social\r\nlife of which arose quite independently of that of bees, the same\r\ncourse of events has been repeated. High intelligence and skill\r\nare confined to the workers, in which the reproductive organs are\r\natrophied. The soldiers have powerful jaws used in defence of the camp,\r\nbut they, too, are sexually incomplete. The females and males, in which\r\nthe reproductive organs have attained huge proportions so that the\r\nbodies are little more than sacs containing the sexual elements, have\r\nno intelligence and very little skill.\r\n\r\nAn extremely curious specialisation, consisting in the formation of\r\nhoney-bearing workers, occurs in some Mexican ants. Some of the workers\r\nof these races absorb so much honey that their bodies become swollen\r\nhoney-bags. The limbs can no longer support the expanded body, and the\r\ninsects, reduced to immobility, do not quit the burrows. Normal life\r\nhas become impossible for these individuals, who soon die for the good\r\nof the community. When the normal workers or the sexual individuals\r\nare hungry, they approach the honey-bearers and take honey from their\r\nmouths. The honey-bearers have become no more than animated cupboards\r\n(Fig. 26).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—A Honey-ant.\r\n\r\n(After Brehm.)]\r\n\r\nThe termites belong to quite another class of the group Insecta, but\r\nin their case a similar sacrifice of the individual to the state\r\nis practised. The females become transformed to shapeless bags of\r\neggs. They cannot move, but remain secluded in the recesses of the\r\n“ant”-hill, where they lay as many as 80,000 eggs a day. The soldiers\r\nhave become provided with jaws so enormous that these unsexed insects\r\ncan perform no function other than defence of the colony.\r\n\r\nThe partial reduction of individuality in social insects never goes\r\nso far as in the cases of the lower animals I have described. It\r\nmay be stated as a general rule that increase in the perfection of\r\norganisation brings with it a more or less complete preservation of\r\nindividuality in the members of a community.\r\n\r\nI shall now examine to what extent this law can be applied in the case\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSOCIETY AND THE INDIVIDUAL IN THE HUMAN RACE\r\n\r\n  Human societies—Differentiation in the human\r\n  race—Learned women—Habits of a bee, _Halictus\r\n  quadricinctus_—Collectivist theories—Criticisms by\r\n  Herbert Spencer and Nietzsche—Progress of individuality\r\n  in the societies of higher beings\r\n\r\n\r\nSocial life is for the most part little developed amongst vertebrate\r\nanimals. The birds and fishes which live in communities present no\r\norganisation of society even comparable with that found amongst\r\ninsects. There is little advance in this respect in the case of\r\nmammals, and it is not until we come to man that highly organised\r\nsocieties are to be found. Man is the first vertebrate to develop an\r\norganised social life. But, whilst in the insect world, instincts are\r\nof supreme importance in the regulation of the community, there is\r\nlittle instinctive action in human communities. The consciousness of\r\nindividuality, or egoism, is very powerful in human beings, and perhaps\r\nfor that reason our ancestors made little progress in the development\r\nof social relations.\r\n\r\nAnthropoid apes adhere in little groups or in families without any true\r\nsocial organisation. Love of the neighbour, or altruism, appears to be\r\na recent and feeble human acquisition.\r\n\r\nAlthough the organisation of human society is far advanced and\r\ndivision of labour very complete, there is no differentiation of the\r\nindividuals comparable with what is found amongst insects. Although in\r\nanimals so different as Siphonophora, bees, wasps, and termites the\r\ndevelopment of the community, proceeding along different lines, has\r\nbrought into existence non-sexual individuals, there is no trace of\r\nthis specialisation amongst human beings.\r\n\r\nCertain abnormalities in the condition of the sexual organs are\r\noccasionally found in men and women, but these cannot be compared with\r\nthe production of sexless individuals that has taken place amongst\r\nother social creatures. I cannot accept the view that we are to see\r\nsomething analogous to the case of worker bees in the prohibition of\r\nsexual relations imposed by some religious systems on a certain number\r\nof individuals. But in any event there is little importance in this\r\noccurrence, which is rapidly becoming rarer.\r\n\r\nIn recent times, both in Europe and the United States of America, there\r\nhas been an active development of a femininist movement impelling women\r\ntowards higher education. Women, no longer content with the avocations\r\nof mother and housewife, have pressed into professions such as law and\r\nmedicine. There is a steady increase in the number of women who study\r\nat the Universities, and countries like Germany, which have tried to\r\nexclude women from higher studies, will soon have to yield before an\r\nirresistible pressure.\r\n\r\nCan we regard the results of this movement as analogous to the\r\nproduction of sexless workers which has taken place amongst social\r\ninsects? I think not. It is undoubtedly true that a certain number\r\nof young women, who, for some reason or other are unlikely to marry,\r\ndevote themselves to scientific study. In these cases, however,\r\ncelibacy is the cause, not the result of the increased intellectual\r\nactivity. On the other hand, it must be remembered that many women\r\nstudents of science eventually marry. In St. Petersburg, for instance,\r\nthere were 1,091 women in the Medical School; of these 80 were already\r\nmarried and 19 were widows. Of the remaining 992, 436 or 44 per cent.\r\nmarried during the course of their studies.\r\n\r\nObservation of the femininist movement, which has lasted for more than\r\nforty years, shows that in most cases there is no tendency towards the\r\nformation of individuals resembling the infertile worker insects. Most\r\nlady doctors and learned women would like nothing better than to be the\r\nfounders of a family. Even the women who have been most distinguished\r\nin the scientific world are no exception to the rule. In this relation\r\nit is very interesting to follow the details of the life of Sophie\r\nKowalevsky, one of the most notable of learned women. In her youth,\r\nwhen she began to study mathematics, she would not admit that feelings\r\nof love had any importance. Later on, however, when she felt herself\r\ngrowing old, these sentiments awoke in her to such an extent that on\r\nthe day when the prize of the Academy of Sciences was bestowed on her,\r\nshe wrote to one of her friends, “I am getting innumerable letters of\r\ncongratulation, but by the strange irony of fate, I have never felt so\r\nunhappy.”\r\n\r\nThe cause of this discontent reveals itself in the words which she\r\naddressed to her most intimate woman friend. “Why is it,” she said,\r\n“that no one loves me? I could give more than most women, and while the\r\nmost ordinary women are loved, as for me, I am not loved.”[169]\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, impossible to regard the celibacy of persons devoted\r\nto religion or to scientific studies as the beginning of a special\r\norganisation analogous to that of worker bees.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is still probable that in the human race a special\r\ndifferentiation has been established for the accomplishment of\r\ndifferent and essential functions.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of human societies has certainly not followed the path\r\nby which social insects attained the formation of sexless individuals.\r\nIt much more closely resembles what has taken place in some isolated\r\nanimal types. A solitary bee, named _Halictus quadricinctus_ (Fig. 27),\r\nis characterised by the fact that the female does not die when she has\r\nlaid her last eggs, as generally happens amongst insects, but remains\r\nalive to cherish her offspring. This final portion of her life does not\r\nlast long, and the bee cannot play the prominent part of governess in a\r\nsociety of insects organised by this specialisation of elderly females.\r\nIn the human race the individual life lasts longer and a division of\r\nlabour takes place in the fashion suggested by _Halictus quadricinctus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—_Halictus quadricinctus._\r\n\r\n(After Buffon.)]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary woman ceases to be fertile at between forty and fifty years\r\nold, that is to say, at a time when, according to statistics, she has\r\nstill on the average twenty years to live. During this long period,\r\nshe can perform an extremely useful function in society, a function\r\nresembling that of the old mothers of _Halictus quadricinctus_, and\r\nconsisting chiefly in the bringing up and education of the children.\r\nWho does not know the extraordinary devotion of grandmothers, and, as\r\na general rule, of old women, who are extremely useful in bringing up\r\nchildren. And none the less, it must not be forgotten that, actually,\r\nold age begins too soon, that it is not what it ought to be under\r\nnormal conditions, and that human life itself does not last nearly so\r\nlong as it ought to do in ideal conditions. We may predict that when\r\nscience occupies the preponderating place in human society that it\r\nought to have, and when knowledge of hygiene is more advanced, human\r\nlife will become much longer and the part of old people will become\r\nmuch more important than it is to-day.\r\n\r\nThe members of human society are not divided into sexual and neuter\r\nindividuals as amongst insects, but the active life of every individual\r\ncan be divided into two periods, the first one of productive activity,\r\nand the second of sterility but none the less devoted to work useful\r\nto the community. The essential difference between the two cases may\r\nbe reduced to the contrast that whilst the individuals of which animal\r\nsocieties are composed are structurally incomplete, in human societies\r\nthe individual preserves his integrity.\r\n\r\nWe come, then, to the result that the more highly organised a social\r\nbeing may be, so also the more highly developed is his individuality.\r\nIt follows that amongst the theories which seek to control social\r\nlife, those are the best which leave a field sufficiently wide and\r\nfree for the development of individual initiative. The ideal which\r\nhas been so often advocated and according to which the individual\r\nis to be sacrificed as completely as possible to society, cannot be\r\nregarded as in harmony with the general law of organic associations.\r\nSpecial conditions exist in social life in which great sacrifices are\r\ninevitable, but such an arrangement cannot be considered as general\r\nand permanent. We may predict that the more human beings succeed in\r\nadvancing communal life, the fewer cases there will be in which the\r\nindividual has to be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of subduing the egoism rooted in human nature, moralists\r\nhave preached renunciation of individual happiness and the need of\r\nsubordinating it to the good of the community. Very often such\r\ndoctrine has borne little fruit, but there are cases where it has been\r\nembraced with such ardour that men and, still more, young women have\r\nbeen led to sacrifice their well-being for what they have taken to be\r\nthe common good. However it may involve self-abnegation, there has been\r\ncontinued insistence on the duty of sacrificing the individual to the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe existing great inequalities in the distribution of wealth have\r\nrevived doctrines the object of which is to redress such injustice.\r\nFor more than a century, different forms of socialism have claimed\r\nto formulate rules for the amelioration of mankind. They agree in\r\na verdict against existing conditions, but follow different paths\r\nin their proposals for the reformation of society. The varieties of\r\nsocialism are so numerous that it is difficult even to define the\r\nword. Although collectivist theories have lost much of their early\r\nthoroughness, they are still far from admitting the just claims of\r\nthe individuals constituting the society. At socialist assemblies and\r\ncongresses the resolutions adopted frequently proclaim aggressively the\r\nsacrifice of the rights of the individual. The members of one socialist\r\nparty have been seen refusing the collaboration of newspapers which are\r\nnot the official organs of the party, or declining any co-operation\r\nwith a government they have proscribed. In strikes organised by\r\nsocialists, work is forbidden to men who ardently desire it. Recently\r\nprinters have refused to set up newspapers the opinions of which they\r\ndid not share, and even doctors have been known to decline to treat\r\nthose belonging to another political party.\r\n\r\nIt is no new charge against collectivists that they would encroach\r\ntoo much on individual liberty. They reply that “in social-democratic\r\nsociety of the future, tyranny and oppression will be impossible. The\r\nsecret of the bond will reside in a discipline totally different from\r\nthe inanimate obedience of the soldier, a discipline depending on a\r\nwilling submission of the individual to the group because of the common\r\nobject.”[170] But such discipline and submission may go so far that the\r\nconscience of the individual is seriously offended. And so amongst the\r\nsocialists themselves there has arisen a small group which declines to\r\naccept this submergence of the individual in the whole. This group is\r\ncomposed of anarchists, who, in the name of liberty and the individual,\r\nattack the property and sometimes the lives of their opponents.\r\n\r\nIt appears that there has been a notable evolution of collectivist\r\ntheories in the century or more in which the abolition of human misery\r\nhas been an accepted problem. Whilst there was formerly advocated\r\nthe total abolition of private property and the establishment of\r\nphalansteries for communal life, at the present time the demand is\r\nlimited to the nationalisation of the means of production, leaving\r\nhousing and food to be provided by individual property.[171]\r\n\r\nThrough a publication, of M. Kautsky, one of their best known\r\nrepresentatives, the social democrats have announced that “the\r\nnationalisation of the land does not necessarily bring with it the\r\nabolition of private dwellings. The customary attachment of the\r\ndwelling to agricultural employment will cease, but there is no reason\r\nwhy the peasants’ houses should become collective property.” “Modern\r\nsocialism does not exclude individual property in food. One of the\r\nmost important, perhaps the most important factor, in making human\r\nlife happy and adding to its pleasures is the possible attainment of\r\na private house. Collective ownership of the land does not exclude\r\nthis.” It is very difficult to separate house and garden, especially\r\nfrom the point of view of considering the pleasures of life. A\r\ngarden furnishes the opportunity for endless improvements, many of\r\nwhich cannot be separated from the idea of individual property. The\r\nconcessions which collectivists have been compelled to make show\r\nconclusively the importance of private property.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding such modifications, many voices have been raised\r\nagainst the prospect of the socialisation of the means of production\r\nand the concomitant limitations of individual enterprise. The great\r\nEnglish philosopher, Herbert Spencer,[172] against whom narrowness\r\nof view or conservatism could be urged, energetically attacked\r\ncollectivist doctrines as tending to reduce human individuality to\r\na dead level. By a series of cogent instances, he showed the evil\r\nresults of the best intentioned efforts to equalise opportunities\r\nand to abolish poverty. He foretold that slavery would be the real\r\noutcome if the State interfered too much in spheres that ought to be\r\nleft to individual enterprise. He believed that the institution of a\r\ncollectivist State would bring great dangers.\r\n\r\nNietzsche has attacked socialism with his customary exaggeration.\r\n“Socialism,”[173] he wrote, “is the fanatical younger brother of dying\r\ndespotism, whose goods he wishes to inherit; his efforts are, in the\r\ndeepest sense of the word, reactionary. He wishes a wealth of power in\r\nthe State greater than despotism ever enjoyed, but he goes beyond all\r\nthe past inasmuch as he strives absolutely to stifle the individual;\r\nfor him the individual is a useless efflorescence of nature to be\r\ntamed into a useful organ of the community.” Further, “Socialism at\r\nleast teaches brutally and convincingly the danger of concentrating\r\npower in the State, for it is a covert attack on the State itself.\r\nWhen its harsh voice raises the war-cry ‘Let the State control as much\r\nas possible,’ the cry will at first become louder; but soon another\r\nphrase will grow equally clamant, ‘Let the State control as little as\r\npossible.’”\r\n\r\nIt is most probable that no shade of socialism will be able to\r\nsolve the problem of social life with a sufficient respect for the\r\nmaintenance of individual liberty. None the less the progress of human\r\nknowledge will inevitably bring about a great levelling of human\r\nfortunes. Intellectual culture will lead men to give up many things\r\nthat are superfluous or even harmful, and that are still thought\r\nindispensable by most people. The conceptions that the greatest good\r\nfortune consists in the complete evolution of the normal cycle of human\r\nlife and that this goal can be reached most easily by plain and sober\r\nhabits will convince men of the folly of much of the luxury that now\r\nshortens human existence. Whilst the rich will choose a simpler mode of\r\nlife and the poor will be able to live better, none the less, private\r\nproperty, acquired or inherited, may be maintained. Evolution must\r\nbe gradual and much effort and new knowledge is required. Sociology,\r\na new-born science, must learn of biology, her older sister. Biology\r\nteaches us that in proportion that the organisation becomes more\r\ncomplex, the consciousness of individuality develops, until a point is\r\nreached at which individuality cannot be sacrificed to the community.\r\nAmongst low creatures such as _Myxomycetes_ and _Siphonophora_, the\r\nindividuals disappear wholly or almost wholly in the community;\r\nbut the sacrifice is small, as in these creatures the consciousness\r\nof individuality has not appeared. Social insects are in a stage\r\nintermediate between that of the lower animals and man. It is only in\r\nman that the individual has definitely acquired consciousness, and for\r\nthat reason a satisfactory social organisation cannot sacrifice it on\r\npretext of the common good. To this conclusion the study of the social\r\nevolution of living beings leads me.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that the study of human individuality is a necessary step\r\nin the organisation of the social life of human beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VII\r\n\r\nPESSIMISM AND OPTIMISM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nPREVALENCE OF PESSIMISM\r\n\r\n  Oriental origin of pessimism—Pessimistic\r\n  poets—Byron—Leopardi—Poushkin—Lermontoff—Pessimism\r\n  and suicide\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to formulate a pessimistic theory of human nature, we\r\nare naturally led to ask why it is that so many famous men have come to\r\na purely pessimistic conception of human life.\r\n\r\nPessimism, although it has been most prominent in modern times, is\r\nextremely old. Everyone knows the pessimistic wail of Ecclesiastes,\r\nwritten nearly ten centuries before our era: “Vanity of Vanities, all\r\nis vanity.” Solomon, the supposed author, states that he “hated life,\r\nbecause the work that is wrought under the sun is grievous unto me, for\r\nall is vanity and vexation of spirit” (Eccl. ii., 17).\r\n\r\nBuddha raised pessimism to the rank of a doctrine. All life seemed to\r\nhim sorrow. “Birth is sorrow, old age is sorrow, disease is sorrow,\r\nunion with one whom we do not love is sorrow, separation from one whom\r\nwe love is sorrow, not to gratify desire is sorrow, in short, our five\r\nbonds with the things of the earth are sorrow.”[174] This Buddhistic\r\npessimism has been the source of most of the modern pessimistic\r\ntheories.\r\n\r\nPessimism arose in the East and was much in vogue in India even apart\r\nfrom Buddhism. In the poems known under the name of Bhartrihari, and\r\ndating from the beginning of the Christian era, human life has been\r\ncommiserated in the following fashion. “One hundred years are the\r\nlimit of the life of man; night takes half of them, half of the other\r\nhalf is childhood and old age, the rest is filled with diseases, with\r\nseparations and the misfortunes that come from them, with working for\r\nothers and with wasting one’s time. Where can happiness be found in an\r\nexistence most like to the bubbles in broken water?” “Man’s health is\r\ndestroyed by every kind of care and disease. When fortune comes to him,\r\nevil follows as if by an open door. Death takes all human beings, one\r\nafter the other, and they can offer no resistance to their fate. What\r\nis there assured amongst all that the mighty Brahma has created?”[175]\r\n\r\nPessimistic theories spread from the Asiatic East to Egypt and Europe.\r\nThree centuries before the Christian era, there arose the philosophy of\r\nHegesias, which maintained that experience was generally deceptive and\r\nthat enjoyment was quickly followed by satiety and disgust. According\r\nto him, the sum of pain surpassed the sum of pleasure in life, so that\r\nhappiness was unattainable, and in reality never existed. It was vain\r\nto seek pleasure and happiness, as these could not be realised. It was\r\nbetter to try to be indifferent, dulling feeling and desire. In fact,\r\nlife was no better than death, and it was often preferable to end it\r\nby suicide. Hegesias was called _Pisithanatos_, the adviser of death.\r\n“Listeners thronged around him, his doctrine spread rapidly, and his\r\ndisciples, persuaded by his voice, gave themselves to death. Ptolemy\r\nwas perturbed by it, and fearing that the dislike of life would become\r\ncontagious, closed the school of Hegesias and exiled its master.”[176]\r\n\r\nThe pessimistic tendency sometimes appears in the writings of many\r\nGreek and Latin philosophers and poets. Seneca wrote: “The spectacle of\r\nhuman life is lamentable. New misfortunes overwhelm you before you have\r\nfreed yourself from the old ones.”[177]\r\n\r\nIt is in modern days, however, that there has been the greatest spread\r\nof pessimism.\r\n\r\nBesides the philosophical theories of the last century, those\r\nof Schopenhauer, von Hartmann and Mailaender, which I discussed\r\nsufficiently in _The Nature of Man_, poets have formulated a\r\npessimistic view of life. Even Voltaire was a pessimist in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  Alas! what are the course and the goal of life?\r\n  Only follies and then the darkness.\r\n  Oh Jupiter! in creating us you made\r\n  A heartless jest.\r\n\r\nIn _The Nature of Man_ I described Byron’s expression of his conception\r\nof the evils of human life. Soon after the death of the great English\r\npoet, a celebrated Italian poet, Giacomo Leopardi, sounded a note of\r\nabandoned pessimism.\r\n\r\nHere are words which he addressed to his own heart[178]: “Be quiet for\r\never, you have beaten enough, nothing is worthy of your beating and the\r\nearth is not worthy of your sighs. Life is nothing but bitterness and\r\nweariness, there is nothing else in it. The world is nothing but mire.\r\nRepose from now onwards. Be in despair for ever. Destiny has given us\r\nnothing but death. Despise henceforth yourself and nature, and the\r\nshameful concealed power which decrees the ruin of all and the infinite\r\nvariety of all.”\r\n\r\nLeopardi makes his readers witnesses of his distraction and his grief:\r\n“I shall study the blind truth”—he wrote in a poem dedicated to\r\nCharles Pépoli—“I shall study the blind fates of things mortal and\r\nimmortal. Why humanity came into existence, and was burdened with pain\r\nand sorrow, to what final end destiny and nature are driving it, for\r\nwhose pleasure or advantage is our great pain, what order, what laws\r\nrule this mysterious universe which wise men cover with praise, and I\r\nam content to wonder at” (_ibid._, p. 15).\r\n\r\nQuite a school of poets has been developed, singing the pain of the\r\nworld, the “Weltschmerz” of German authors, amongst whom Heine and\r\nNicolas Lenau are specially distinguished.\r\n\r\nRussian poetry was born under the influence of Byronism, and its best\r\nexponents, Poushkin and Lermontoff, often laboured over the problem of\r\nthe object of human existence, finding only sad answers. Poushkin, who\r\nis justly regarded as the father of lyric poetry in Russia, stated his\r\npessimistic conception in the following lines:—\r\n\r\n  Useless gift, gift of chance,\r\n  Life, why wert thou given me?\r\n  And why from the beginning art thou doomed\r\n  Irrevocably to death?\r\n\r\n  What unfriendly power\r\n  Has drawn me from the darkness,\r\n  Has filled my soul with passion,\r\n  And breathed doubt into my soul?\r\n\r\n  There is no goal for me,\r\n  My heart and my soul are empty;\r\n  And the dull emotion of life\r\n  Has filled me with black care.\r\n\r\nRecently, Mde. Ackermann, in a series of short poems, has given voice\r\nto the grief caused to her by the world and life as they are, although\r\nshe does not state exactly the reason of her bitter complaints.\r\n\r\nWhilst pessimistic philosophers and poets reflect the thoughts and\r\nfeelings of their contemporaries, it is certain that they also\r\nseriously influence their readers. And so there has come into existence\r\na deeply rooted conviction that the miseries of human life are far\r\nfrom being countervailed by its happiness. Probably such ideas have\r\ninfluenced the number of suicides. We do not know with any certainty\r\nthe real motives of most cases of self-destruction, but it cannot be\r\ndenied that the trend of modern thought has played an important part.\r\nAccording to statistics, the chief causes of suicide are “hypochondria,\r\nmelancholia, weariness of life, and unbalancing of the mind.” Thus from\r\nthe Danish statistics it appears (and Denmark is the country in which\r\nsuicide is most prevalent) that of 1,000 cases of suicides of males,\r\nbetween 1866 and 1895, 224, or one-quarter, were referred to the causes\r\nI have just mentioned. In the case of women, the corresponding figures\r\nare higher, amounting to nearly one-half (403 out of 1,000). The second\r\nmost common cause of male suicides is alcoholism (164 in 1,000).[179]\r\nIt is very probable that pessimism was the determining condition in\r\nmost of the suicides referred to these two categories of causes.\r\nLeaving out of the question the true cases of mental alienation,\r\namongst the victims of melancholia, hypochondria and weariness of life,\r\nin whom the mental condition was not pathological in the strict sense\r\nof the word, there must have been many who killed themselves because\r\ntheir view of life was pessimistic. And amongst the victims of drink,\r\nthere are many who take to alcohol because they are convinced that\r\nlife is not worth preserving.\r\n\r\nThe progressive increase in the numbers of suicides in modern times\r\nis an index of the great influence of pessimism. There have been even\r\nsocieties for the promotion of suicide. In such a society, founded in\r\nParis in the beginning of last century, members placed their names\r\nin an urn, to be drawn by chance. He whose name was drawn had to\r\nkill himself in the presence of the other members. According to its\r\nrules, this society admitted only persons of honour who must have had\r\nexperience of “the injustice of man, the ingratitude of a friend, the\r\ninfidelity of a wife or mistress, and who, moreover, for many years\r\nhad had a void in their souls and a distaste of what this world can\r\noffer.”[180]\r\n\r\nAlthough such societies no longer exist, individuals continue to put\r\ntheir lives to an end, in greater numbers every year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF PESSIMISM\r\n\r\n  Attempts to assign reasons for the pessimistic conception\r\n  of life—Views of E. von Hartmann—Analysis of\r\n  Kowalevsky’s work on the Psychology of Pessimism\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the facts I brought together in my last chapter, there\r\nis occasion to inquire if it be possible to discover the intimate\r\nmechanism by which men arrive at a conception of life as an evil to be\r\ngot rid of as quickly as possible. Why do so many think that man is\r\nless happy than the beasts, and that cultured and intelligent men are\r\nmore unhappy than those who are ignorant or feeble-minded ?\r\n\r\nI have related how in a society of friends of suicide, injustice and\r\nunfaithfulness were regarded as prime factors in arousing a distaste\r\nfor life. Shakspeare made Hamlet exclaim that if it were possible to\r\nput an end to our days no one would continue to live:—\r\n\r\n  For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\n  The oppressor’s wrong, the proud man’s contumely?\r\n\r\nFor Byron, besides diseases, death and slavery, the evils that we see,\r\nthere are others:—\r\n\r\n  And worse, the woes we see not—which throb through\r\n  The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.\r\n\r\nIn many of his works he insists on the feeling of satiety which was\r\nalmost continually upon him. Every sensation of pleasure that came to\r\nhim was rapidly succeeded by a still stronger feeling of disgust.\r\n\r\nHeine thought that existence was evil and saw\r\n\r\n        ... across the hard surfaces of the rocks\r\n    The homes of men and the hearts of men—\r\n  In the one as in the others, lies, imposture and misery.\r\n\r\nAs I urged in _The Nature of Man_, consciousness of the shortness of\r\nhuman life has been an important factor in exciting pessimism, and we\r\nfind this theme recurring in pessimistic writers. Leopardi returns to\r\nit again and again in his poems. “Falling in peril of death from some\r\nmysterious disease,” he said in his _Souvenirs_, “I lamented over my\r\nsweet youth and the flower of my poor days which was to fall so soon,\r\nand often in the midnight hours wove from my sorrows, by the pale light\r\nof my lamp, a sad poem, and in the silence of the night wept over my\r\nfleeting life, and half fainting, sang to myself my funeral song”\r\n(_loc. cit._, p. 28). The bas-relief on an ancient tomb, representing\r\nthe departure of a young girl who took farewell of her friends,\r\nsuggested to Leopardi the following thoughts: “Mother, who from their\r\nbirth makes her family of living beings tremble and weep, Nature,\r\nmonster unworthy of our praise, who brings into the world and nurtures\r\nonly to kill, if the premature death of a mortal be evil, why do you\r\nbring it on so many innocent heads? If it be a good, why do you make it\r\nsad for those who go and for those left behind? Why is it the hardest\r\ngrief to console? The only relief from our woes is death, death, the\r\ninevitable end, the immutable law which you have established for human\r\nbeings. Why, alas, after the sad voyage of life, do you not make the\r\narrival joyful? This certain end, this end which is in our souls all\r\nour lives, which alone can soothe our troubles, why do you drape it in\r\nblack and surround it with mournful shades? Why do you make the harbour\r\nmore terrible than the open seas?” (_loc. cit._, p. 55).\r\n\r\nThe three chief grievances—injustice, disease, and death—often come\r\ntogether. From the anthropomorphic point of view fate is represented as\r\na sort of wicked being who commits injustice by visiting all kinds of\r\nevils on mankind.\r\n\r\nA pessimistic conception of life is arrived at by a complex\r\npsychological process in which both feelings and reflection are\r\ninvolved, and hence it is difficult to analyse it satisfactorily.\r\nFormerly, therefore, writers were content with general and very vague\r\nestimates of the process by which we may become pessimists. Ed. von\r\nHartmann has tried to deal more exactly with this inner process of\r\nthe human mind. In the first place, he lays stress on the fact that\r\npleasures always bring less satisfaction than pains bring grief.\r\nFalse notes in music, for instance, are more painful than the best\r\nmusic is delightful. The pain of toothache is much more violent\r\nthan the pleasure when relief comes. So also with all diseases. In\r\nlove, according to Hartmann, the pleasure is always very greatly\r\nover-balanced by the pain. Muscular work brings pleasure only in a very\r\nsmall degree, and devotion to science and art and intellectual work in\r\ngeneral brings more pain than pleasure to the votaries. As the result\r\nof an analysis, Hartmann is convinced that there is much more pain than\r\npleasure in the world. Pessimism is founded upon the essential nature\r\nof human feelings.\r\n\r\nM. Kowalevsky,[181] a German philosopher at Koenigsberg, adopting the\r\nmodern habit of measuring mental processes as exactly as possible, has\r\nrecently published an attempt to analyse pessimism psychologically.\r\nAlthough this has not solved the problem, it is extremely interesting\r\nas an instance of the application of the methods now being adopted in\r\nmodern psychology.\r\n\r\nM. Kowalevsky took advantage of all the known methods of estimating the\r\nrelative values of our emotions; he tried to make use of the notes of\r\nMunsterberg, another living psychologist who kept a journal in which\r\nhe set down daily his psychical and psycho-physical impressions. The\r\nobject of the work had no relation to the question of pessimism, and\r\nfor that reason Kowalevsky thought that it was specially important in\r\nhis investigations.\r\n\r\nMunsterberg was not content with the existing classification of\r\nemotions as agreeable or painful. He subdivided them much further. He\r\nrecognised, for instance, emotions of tranquillity and excitement,\r\nserious and pleasant impressions. Having completed the reckoning,\r\nKowalevsky came to the conclusion that his colleague, who was by\r\nno means a pessimist, but a psychologist of well-balanced mind,\r\nexperienced many more painful emotions (about 60 per cent. as compared\r\nwith 40 per cent.) than agreeable emotions. “Such a result is in favour\r\nof pessimism,” concluded Kowalevsky.\r\n\r\nHowever, he went beyond the foregoing enquiry. By several other\r\nmethods, he tried to gain an exact idea of the value of our emotions.\r\nHe visited elementary schools in order to investigate the pleasures\r\nand pains of the scholars. In the case of 104 boys, of eleven to\r\nthirteen years of age, he found that pain was much more deeply felt\r\nthan corresponding pleasure. Thus, while in 88 cases illness was set\r\ndown as an evil, only in 21 was health reckoned as a good. One-third of\r\nthe pupils noted down war amongst evils, whilst only one noted peace\r\namongst the good things. Poverty was written down thirteen times as an\r\nevil, against twice in which riches were put down as a good. In another\r\nseries of investigations, Kowalevsky took notes on the pleasures and\r\npains felt by pupils of the two sexes attending the same school. The\r\nresult was that the greatest evil, according to them, was illness,\r\nnoted 43 times, then death 42 times, after which came fire 37 times,\r\nhunger 23 times, floods 20 times. Amongst the good things, the first\r\nplace was given, as might have been expected, to games (30) and the\r\nsecond to presents.\r\n\r\nAs Kowalevsky did not find that such investigations could solve the\r\nproblem, he tried to discover a more exact method. With this object,\r\nhe turned to different sensations, such as those of smell, hearing and\r\ntaste, to which he applied methods of exact measurement. In the case of\r\ntaste, for instance, he determined the minimum quantity of different\r\nsubstances which could excite definitely pleasant or unpleasant\r\nsensations. In his experiments, Kowalevsky found that doses which\r\ngave bad tastes were not balanced by those which gave good tastes.\r\nFor instance, to neutralise the unpleasant taste of quinine, it was\r\nnecessary to employ a much larger quantity of sugar. He was specially\r\npleased with one experiment. Four persons were given definite mixtures\r\nof sugar and quinine in order to discover the proportion of the two\r\nsubstances necessary to obtain a neutral sensation. He found that to\r\ntake away the bad taste of quinine, it was necessary to double the\r\nquantity of sugar given. Similarly with smells, he found that those\r\nwhich were unpleasant were appreciated much more strongly than those\r\nwhich were pleasant. Here, then, was a series of scientific results\r\nsupporting the view of the pessimists. Must we really conclude from\r\nthem that the world is very badly arranged? The analysis of good and\r\nbad temper made by Kowalevsky is in favour of such an interpretation.\r\nIn order to estimate these conditions of mind, he measured the gait,\r\nthat is to say, the number of steps taken in a minute. This method\r\ndepended upon the following idea. It is an accepted view that the\r\ncondition of mind is shown by the rapidity of the human walk; we\r\nhave only to compare the slow pace of a man in deep grief with the\r\nrapid steps of a man in a state of joy. Pain, as a general rule,\r\ndepresses, while joy stimulates voluntary movements. The result of\r\nthe measurements taken according to this method give a new argument\r\nin favour of pessimism. However, it is useless to attempt to analyse\r\nthese figures on which Kowalevsky had to employ the integral calculus,\r\nbecause the principle of his method cannot be supported. As a matter of\r\nfact, the rapidity of walking is an index of the degree of excitation,\r\nand not of the happy or unhappy condition of the mind. When a person\r\nsuddenly undergoes a strong impression, either pleasant or unpleasant,\r\nhe takes to walking actively about in his room, and may even want to\r\ngo out of doors to walk more quickly. A letter which has been received\r\nand which gives some unexpected news, as for instance of the infidelity\r\nof a person one loves, or of an inheritance which one did not expect,\r\nproduces a condition of excitement shown chiefly by rapid walking. Many\r\norators and professors have to make gestures and to walk about in the\r\ncourse of their lectures. A man of science to whom some new idea comes\r\nand who wishes to think it out, rises from his chair and begins to\r\nwalk. But not only on such pleasant occasions, but when one has to face\r\nan insult or an act of defiance which makes one very angry, the need to\r\nwalk actively is felt. It is therefore impossible to utilise records of\r\nmovements in the study of the pessimistic state of mind.\r\n\r\nM. Kowalevsky employed still another mode of attacking the problem.\r\nHe examined the recollection of painful or pleasant impressions. He\r\nasked the children of both sexes, whom he was investigating, questions\r\nwhich gave him indications as to whether pleasures or pains made\r\nthe more lasting impression on the memory, and he registered the\r\nanswers. The result, which agreed with what had already been obtained\r\nby Mr. Colegrove, an American psychologist, was unfavourable to the\r\npessimistic view. He found, in fact, that in the majority of cases (70\r\nper cent.) recollection of pleasant impressions predominated. However,\r\nin such investigations there is a facile source of error arising from\r\nthe condition of mind of those who are being questioned. It is probable\r\nthat Kowalevsky made his enquiry in school during recreation time, when\r\nmost of the pupils were free from the boredom of the actual class. When\r\nwe are happy the tendency exists in us to recall pleasant impressions\r\nof the past. If the enquiry had been made during a difficult or\r\nwearying lesson, or on children shut up in a hospital, or undergoing\r\npunishment, it is probable that the result would have been reversed.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all such attempts to solve a problem so complex as\r\nthat of pessimism, even by the so-called exact methods of physiological\r\npsychology, cannot lead to any convincing result. Thus Kowalevsky’s\r\ndifferent investigations led to contradictory conclusions. Whilst some\r\nof his series of facts supported the pessimistic conception, others\r\nwere opposed to it, and he obtained no definite general conclusion.\r\nHow can one expect to apply a method of measurement to sensations and\r\nemotions so different, not only from the qualitative point of view,\r\nbut also in relation to their intensity? Take, for instance, the case\r\nof an individual who has experienced in one day nine sensations which\r\nwere painful and one which was agreeable. According to the valuation\r\nof experimental psychologists, he ought to have reason to become a\r\npessimist. However, this may be far from the case, if the nine painful\r\nimpressions were much weaker than the single happy impression. The\r\nfirst were provoked by small wounds to his pride, fleeting pains of no\r\nimportance, and small losses of money, whilst the happy emotion came\r\nfrom receiving a love letter. The sum of the ten impressions would be a\r\nhappy one, and might well put him in an optimistic frame of mind. The\r\nlearned attempts of experimental psychologists must be abandoned, as\r\nincapable of illuminating the problem. If, however, the human spirit\r\nstill seeks some means of explaining the psychology of pessimism, there\r\nremains only the less subtle method given by the biographical study of\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nPESSIMISM IN ITS RELATION TO HEALTH AND AGE\r\n\r\n  Relation between pessimism and the state of the\r\n  health—History of a man of science who was pessimistic\r\n  when young, and who became an optimist in old\r\n  age—Optimism of Schopenhauer when old—Development of\r\n  the sense of life—Development of the senses in blind\r\n  people—The sense of obstacles\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimals and children in good health are generally cheerful and of\r\noptimistic temperament. As soon as they fall ill they become sad\r\nand melancholy until their recovery. We may infer from this that an\r\noptimistic view is correlated with normal health, whilst pessimism\r\narises from some physical or mental disease. And so in the case of\r\nthe prophets of pessimism, we may seek for the origin of their views\r\nin some affliction. The pessimism of Byron has been attributed to his\r\nclub-foot, and that of Leopardi to tuberculosis, these two nineteenth\r\ncentury exponents of pessimism having died whilst young. Buddha and\r\nSchopenhauer, on the other hand, reached old age, whilst Hartmann died\r\nwhen sixty-four years old. Their diseases at the time when they formed\r\ntheir theories could not have been very dangerous, and none the less\r\nthey took a most gloomy view of human existence. The recent historical\r\ninvestigations of Dr. Iwan Bloch[182] make it very probable that\r\nSchopenhauer, in his youth, contracted syphilis. There has been found\r\na note-book of the great philosopher in which he wrote down the details\r\nof the severe mercurial treatment which he had to undergo. The disease,\r\nhowever, was not contracted until several years after the appearance of\r\nhis great pessimistic work.\r\n\r\nAlthough we must attach due weight to the connection between disease\r\nand pessimism, we can assure ourselves that the problem is more complex\r\nthan it appears at first sight. It is well known that blind people\r\noften enjoy a constant good humour, and, amongst the apostles of\r\noptimism, there has been the philosopher Duering,[183] who lost his\r\nsight during his youth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it has been noticed that persons affected with chronic\r\ndiseases frequently have a very optimistic conception of life, whilst\r\nyoung people in full strength may become sad, melancholic, and\r\nabandoned to the most extreme pessimism. Such a contrast has been\r\nwell described by Émile Zola in his novel _La Joie de Vivre_, where a\r\nrheumatic old man, tried by severe attacks of gout, maintained his good\r\nhumour, whilst his young son, although vigorous and in good health,\r\nprofessed extreme pessimism.\r\n\r\nI have a cousin who lost his sight in early youth. When he grew up he\r\nformed a most enviable judgment of life. He lived in his imagination\r\nand everything in life seemed to him good and beautiful; he married,\r\nand pictured his wife to himself as the most beautiful woman in the\r\nworld, and thus he feared nothing more than the recovery of his sight.\r\nHe had adapted himself to live without sight, and was convinced that\r\nthe reality was much lower than his imagination. He feared that if he\r\nwere able to see his wife she would appear to him less beautiful.\r\n\r\nI know a girl twenty-six years old, blind from her birth, the subject\r\nof infantile paralysis and liable to fits of epilepsy. She is nearly an\r\nidiot, lives in a carriage, and sees life from its best side. She is\r\ncertainly the most happy member of all her family.\r\n\r\nThe good humour and megalomania of those affected with general\r\nparalysis of the insane also is well known. All such examples show that\r\npessimism cannot be explained as depending on bad health.\r\n\r\nExamination of the state of mind of a pessimist may throw some light on\r\nthe subject. There has been within my own circle a typical case of a\r\nperson who went through a phase of life in which everything seemed as\r\ngloomy as possible. My intimate knowledge of him makes it possible to\r\napply my observations to the matter under discussion.\r\n\r\nThe subject was born of parents of good health and in comfortable\r\ncircumstances, so that, from the beginning of his life, he was\r\nsurrounded by a favourite environment. He lived in the country and\r\nescaped the diseases of childhood, so that he reached maturity in good\r\nhealth, and passed well through college and the university. Science\r\nattracted him, and he had the ambition to become a distinguished\r\ninvestigator. He threw himself into a scientific career with zeal and\r\nability. His ardent disposition, although certainly favourable to work,\r\nwas the cause of many troubles. He wished to succeed too quickly, and\r\nthe obstacles he encountered embittered him. As he thought himself\r\nnaturally talented, he conceived it to be the duty of his seniors to\r\naid his development. And so, when he met with natural and very common\r\nindifference from those who had already become successful, the young\r\nman thought that there was a plot against him, to bring to nothing his\r\nscientific talents. From this view, many quarrels and difficulties\r\narose, and as he could not overcome these sufficiently quickly, he\r\nfell into a mood of pessimism. In this life, he said to himself, the\r\nmain thing is to adapt oneself to external conditions. According to\r\nDarwin’s law of natural selection, the individuals who do not succeed\r\nin adapting themselves go to the wall. The survivors are not the\r\nbest but only the most cunning. In the history of the earth it has\r\nbeen seen that many lower animals have long survived creatures much\r\nhigher in organisation and general evolution. Whilst so many of the\r\nhigher mammals, the nearest relatives of man, have been crushed out of\r\nexistence, simpler animals, such as evil-smelling cockroaches, have\r\nsurvived from the remotest times, and multiply in the neighbourhood of\r\nman in despite of his efforts to exterminate them. The animal series\r\nand human evolution itself show that delicacy of the nervous system,\r\nwith its concomitant extreme development of the sensibilities, hinders\r\nthe power of adaptation and brings with it insuperable evils. The\r\nleast blow to his pride, or a slighting word from a comrade, threw\r\nthis pessimist into a most painful condition. No, he would cry, it\r\nwould be better to be without friends, if one is to be wounded so\r\ndeeply by them. It would be best to seclude oneself in some remote\r\nspot and be engrossed in one’s work. He was very impressionable and a\r\nlover of music, and from his visits to the opera, he retained in his\r\nmind an air from the “Flûte enchantée.” “Were I as small as a snail,\r\nI would hide myself in my shell.” His moral hypersensibility was\r\nassociated with physical hyperæsthesia. Noises of all kinds, such as\r\nthe whistling of railway-trains, the cries of street-vendors, or the\r\nbarking of dogs, excited extremely painful sensations. The least trace\r\nof light prevented him from sleeping at night. The unpleasant flavour\r\nof most drugs made it impossible for him to take medicine. He agreed\r\nthoroughly with the pessimistic philosophers who declare that the ills\r\nof life far surpass the good things. He required no experiments on the\r\nsense of taste to convince him. He believed that the organisation of\r\nhis body prevented him from becoming adapted to external conditions and\r\nthat he would have to disappear like the mammoth and the anthropoid\r\napes.\r\n\r\nThe course of his life confirmed the convictions of our pessimist.\r\nHe had no private fortune and married a woman who became affected\r\nwith tuberculosis, and so was confronted with the greatest evils of\r\nexistence. A young lady, hitherto in good health, contracted influenza\r\nin some northern town. It was a mere nothing, said the doctors;\r\ninfluenza is everywhere and no one escapes it; after a little patience\r\nand rest, she will be well again. However the “influenza” persisted\r\nand brought with it feebleness and wasting. The doctors then found\r\nthat there was a little dullness in the apex of the left lung, but as\r\nthere was no bad family history, there was nothing to fear. I need not\r\ndescribe the familiar course of events. The trifling influenza was\r\nreplaced by degeneration of the left lung, and brought death after four\r\nyears of great suffering. Towards the end, when there was no hope, the\r\npatient found her only solace in morphine. Under the influence of that\r\ndrug, she passed hours free from pain and in relative calm, but her\r\nexcited imagination passed almost into hallucination.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the death of his wife was a severe shock\r\nto the husband. His pessimism became complete. He was a widower at\r\nthe age of twenty-eight years, and, in his condition of mental and\r\nphysical exhaustion, took to morphine like his wife. He knew that\r\nit was a poison which would complete the ruin of his constitution\r\nand make his work impossible. But what was the value of his life?\r\nAs his organisation was too nervous for him to adapt himself to\r\nexternal conditions, was it not as well to come to the aid of natural\r\nselection and so make room for others? As it happened, a large dose of\r\nmorphia did not solve the problem. It produced in him a condition of\r\nextraordinary happiness combined with extreme physical weakness. Little\r\nby little the instinct of life awoke in him, and he resumed his work.\r\nPessimism, however, remained the fundamental quality in his character.\r\nLife was not worth the pains necessary to protect it. It would be\r\na true crime to bring into the world other living beings doomed to\r\nelimination by natural selection. Moral and physical sensibility, as\r\nthey continued to develop, brought with them so much evil that there\r\ncould be no good end. The “injustice” of those who were unwilling to\r\n“understand” him made life painful to the man himself and to those\r\nabout him. The closest absorption and hard work made his existence more\r\ntolerable, but his pessimistic conception was not in the least altered.\r\nThus, he was easily driven to morphia for consolation, when he suffered\r\nfrom some act of “injustice” or vexation. A severe fit of poisoning,\r\nhowever, stopped this excess.\r\n\r\nYears passed. When he discussed with his friends the problem of\r\nthe goal of human life and similar topics, he was always ardent in\r\nsupporting the point of view of pessimism. However, he occasionally\r\nwondered if his pleading for this were really sincere. As his nature\r\nwas honest and frank, this question which he put to his conscience\r\nappeared most curious to him. Analysis of what passed in his mind\r\nrevealed to him a change. It was not that his conceptions had changed\r\nin the course of years, but rather his feelings and sensations. As\r\nhe was now in full maturity, between forty-five and fifty years old,\r\nhe found that there was a great change in the intensity of these\r\nlast. Disagreeable sounds did not trouble him to the same extent as\r\nformerly, and he was undisturbed by the caterwauling of cats or by\r\nharsh street cries. As his hypersensibility diminished his character\r\nbecame more tolerant. Even the injustices or wounds to his pride which\r\nformerly drove him to morphia, no longer provoked in him any painful\r\nreaction. He could easily conceal the bad effect of these upon him,\r\nand no longer felt them with the same intensity. Thus his character\r\nhad become much more supportable to those with him, and much better\r\nbalanced.\r\n\r\n“It is old age which is come upon me,” he cried; “I feel painful\r\nimpressions much less acutely and pleasant impressions have less\r\neffect on me. The relative proportions of the two remain as before,\r\nthat is to say, unpleasant things still impress me much more strongly\r\nthan pleasant things.” By analysing and comparing his emotions, he\r\ndiscovered something new, in fact that some impressions were, so to\r\nspeak, neutral. As he was less sensitive to unharmonious sounds, and\r\nat the same time less affected by music itself, he found himself in\r\na more tranquil condition. Awakening in the middle of the night, he\r\nexperienced a kind of happiness which reminded him of that formerly\r\nproduced by morphine, and which was characterised by his hearing no\r\nsound, either pleasant or unpleasant. He became less disgusted by\r\ndrugs, but at the same time indifferent to the pleasures of the table\r\nwhich he had appreciated in his youth. He also delighted in consuming\r\nmore and more simple food. A piece of black bread and a glass of water\r\nbecame real treats to him. Insipid dishes, which he formerly despised,\r\nwere now specially agreeable to him.\r\n\r\nJust as in the evolution of art, violent coloration has yielded to the\r\nlow tones of Puvis de Chavannes, as views of fields and meadows are\r\npreferred to those of mountains and lakes; just as in literature,\r\ntragic and romantic studies have been successfully replaced by scenes\r\nof daily life, so the psychical development of my friend displayed\r\na similar change. Instead of taking his pleasure in mountains or in\r\nplaces famed for their picturesqueness, he was content to watch the\r\nbudding of the leaves of the trees of his garden, or a snail overcoming\r\nits fears and putting out its horns. The simplest occurrences, such\r\nas the lisping or the smile of a baby or the first words of a child,\r\nbecame sources of real delight to this elderly man of science. What\r\nwas the meaning of these changes which took so many years to be\r\naccomplished? It was the growth of his sense of life. The instinct of\r\nlife is little developed in youth. Just as a young woman gets more\r\npain than pleasure from the earlier part of her married life, just as\r\na new-born baby cries, so the impressions from life, especially when\r\nthey are very keenly felt, bring more pain than pleasure during a long\r\nperiod of human life. The sensations and feelings are not stable; they\r\nundergo evolution, and when that takes place more or less normally, it\r\nbrings about a state of psychical equilibrium.\r\n\r\nAnd thus my friend, formerly so entrenched in pessimism, came to share\r\nmy optimistic view of life. The discussions that we had had for so many\r\nyears ended in complete agreement. “However,” said he, “to understand\r\nthe value of life, one must have lived long; otherwise one is in the\r\nposition of a man blind from his birth to whom are recounted the\r\nbeauties of colours.” In a word, my friend towards the end of his life\r\nchanged from abject pessimism to complete optimism.\r\n\r\nSuch a transformation or evolution cannot be regarded as unusual.\r\nIn _The Nature of Man_, I showed that most of the great pessimistic\r\nwriters had been young men. Such were Buddha, Byron, Leopardi,\r\nSchopenhauer, Hartmann, and Mailaender, and there might be added many\r\nother names of less well known men.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been asked why Schopenhauer, who was certainly\r\nsincere in his philosophy and who extolled Nirvana as the perfect\r\nstate, came to have a strong attachment to life, instead of putting\r\nit to a premature end as was done later on by Mailaender. The reason\r\nwas that the philosopher of Frankfort lived long enough to acquire a\r\nstrong instinct of life. M. Moebius,[184] a well-known authority on\r\nmadness, has made a close investigation of Schopenhauer’s biography,\r\nand has established the fact that towards the end of his life his views\r\nwere tinged with optimistic colours. On his seventieth anniversary, he\r\ntook pleasure in the consoling idea of the Hindoo Oupanischad and of\r\nFlourens that the span of man’s life might reach a century. As Moebius\r\nput it, “Schopenhauer as an old man enjoyed life and was no longer a\r\npessimist” (p. 94). Not long before his death he still hoped to survive\r\nyet another twenty years. It is true that Schopenhauer never recanted\r\nhis early pessimistic writings, but that was probably because he did\r\nnot fully realise his own mental evolution.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the work of modern psychologists, I cannot\r\nfind recognition of the cycle of evolution of the human mind. In\r\nKowalevsky’s able and conscientious study of pessimism, I was specially\r\nstruck by one phrase. “Evils such as hunger, disease, and death are\r\nequally terrible at all stages of life and in every rank of society”\r\n(p. 95) said that author. I notice here a failure to recognise the\r\nmodification of the emotions in the course of life which, none the\r\nless, is one of the great facts of human nature. Fear of death is by\r\nno means equally great at all stages of life. A child is ignorant of\r\ndeath and has no conscious aversion from it. The youth and the young\r\nman know that death is a terrible thing, but they have not the horror\r\nof it that comes to a mature man in whom the instinct of life has\r\nbecome fully developed. And we see that young men are careless of the\r\nlaws of hygiene, whilst old men devote to them sedulous attention.\r\nThis difference is probably a notable cause of pessimism in young men.\r\nIn his studies of the mind, Moebius[185] has stated his view that\r\npessimism is a phase of youth which is succeeded by a serener spirit.\r\n“One may remain a pessimist in theory,” he says, “but actually to be\r\none, it is necessary to be young. As years increase, a man clings more\r\nfirmly to life.” “When an old man is free from melancholia, he is not\r\na pessimist at heart.” “We cannot yet explain clearly the psychology\r\nof the pessimism of the young, but at least we can lay down the\r\nproposition that it is a disease of youth” (p. 182).\r\n\r\nThe cases of Schopenhauer and of the man of science whose psychical\r\nhistory I have sketched fully confirm the view of the alienist of\r\nLeipzig.\r\n\r\nThe conception that there is an evolution of the instinct of life in\r\nthe course of the development of a human being is the true foundation\r\nof optimistic philosophy. It is so important that it should be examined\r\nwith the minutest care. Our senses are capable of great cultivation.\r\nArtists develop the sense of colour far beyond the point attained\r\nby ordinary men, and distinguish shades that others do not notice.\r\nHearing, taste, and smell also can be educated. Wine tasters have an\r\nappreciation of wine much more acute than that of other men. A friend\r\nof mine, who does not drink wine, can distinguish burgundy from claret\r\nonly by the shapes of the bottles, but is devoted to tea and has a very\r\nfine palate for different blends. I do not know if a good palate is a\r\nnatural gift, but however this may be, it is certain that the palate\r\ncan be brought to a high condition of perfection.\r\n\r\nThe development of the senses is specially notable in the case of the\r\nblind in whom other powers become extremely acute. As I thought that\r\ninvestigation of the educability of other senses in blind persons very\r\nimportant from the point of view of the development of the sense of\r\nlife, I have tried to obtain the best available information on the\r\nquestion. The perfection of touch in the blind is accepted so generally\r\nas a truth that one would have expected to find convincing facts in its\r\nfavour. However, it is not true. Griesbach,[186] using a well-known\r\nmethod for estimating tactile discrimination, found that the sense of\r\ntouch is not more acute in the blind than in normal persons. Blind\r\npersons distinguished the points of a pair of compasses as separate,\r\nonly when they were at least as far apart as in case of normal persons.\r\nDr. Javal,[187] a well-known oculist who himself became blind, stated\r\nhis surprise at finding that “tactile discrimination is quite notably\r\nless acute in the case of the blind than in the case of those with\r\nunimpaired vision. For instance, the index finger of a blind man who\r\nwas a great reader got separate sensations from the points of a pair\r\nof compasses only when these were three millimetres apart, whilst a\r\nman with normal sight had the double sensation at a distance of two\r\nmillimetres” (p. 123). Griesbach goes still farther, stating that\r\nneither hearing nor smell is better developed in the blind than\r\namongst normal people. Although these senses may come to replace to a\r\ncertain extent the sense of sight, this occurs merely because the blind\r\nperson uses impressions which the clear-sighted person hardly notices.\r\nAs we see what is going on around us, we do not concentrate our\r\nattention on the different sounds and smells or other such phenomena.\r\nThe blind person, on the other hand, not being absorbed by impressions\r\nof sight, gives attention to the others. Such and such a sound tells\r\nhim that the garden gate of his neighbour has been opened to let out a\r\ncarriage which he must avoid. A particular smell lets him recognise the\r\nplace where he is, as stable or kitchen.\r\n\r\nFrom the present point of view, it is not exactly the acuteness of the\r\nsenses which is most important. The acuteness might be equal in a blind\r\nperson and in a normal person. It might even be greater in the latter,\r\nand yet it is only the blind person who can decipher without difficulty\r\nraised points so as to understand their meaning as well as when a\r\nnormal person reads a printed book. This power of the blind person is\r\ndeveloped only after a long period of learning, and depends on the\r\nappreciation of very delicate tactile impressions. I must point out,\r\nmoreover, that the method of deciding by means of a pair of compasses\r\ngives information only with regard to one side of the tactile sense.\r\n\r\nHowever, although we admit that blind people do not really gain\r\nanything in the four remaining senses, there is developed in them a\r\nspecial kind of sensibility, which is spoken of in their case as a\r\nsixth sense, the “sense of obstacles.” Blind people, especially those\r\nwho have lost their sight in youth, acquire a surprising habit of\r\navoiding obstacles and of recognising at a distance objects round\r\nabout them. Blind children, for instance, can play in a garden, without\r\nknocking themselves against the trees.\r\n\r\nDr. Javal[188] states that some blind people, when passing in front\r\nof a house, can count the ground floor windows. A professor, who had\r\nbeen blind from the age of four years, could walk in the garden without\r\nstriking against a tree or post. He appreciated a wall at a distance\r\nof two metres from it. One day, going for the first time into a large\r\napartment, he recognised the presence of a big piece of furniture in\r\nthe middle, which he took to be a billiard table.\r\n\r\nAnother blind man, walking in the street, could distinguish houses from\r\nshops and could count the number of doors and windows. The existence\r\nof this sense of obstacles rests upon so many exact facts that it is\r\nindubitable. The opinions as to the mechanism by which it operates,\r\nhowever, are very varied. Dr. Zell[189] thinks that it is not a sense\r\npeculiar to blind people and “that those of normal sight could equally\r\nwell acquire it by practice, because it exists in nearly everyone\r\nwithout being noticed.” None the less, there are some blind people who,\r\neven in the course of years, do not acquire it. M. Javal, for instance,\r\nlearnt to read with his fingers extremely well, but was never able to\r\ndistinguish obstacles at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe most probable hypothesis refers this sixth sense to the action of\r\nthe tympanic membrane and the auditory apparatus. It is known that\r\nloud noise makes it more difficult to perceive obstacles, and snow,\r\nby dulling the sound of steps, has a precisely similar effect. Blind\r\ntuners, in whom the sense of hearing is well developed, have the sixth\r\nsense very marked.\r\n\r\nThe examples I have given show that the human body possesses senses\r\nwhich come into operation only in special conditions, and which\r\nrequire a special education. The “sense of life” to a certain\r\nextent comes within this category. In some persons it develops very\r\nimperfectly, generally revealing itself only late in life, but\r\nsometimes a disease or the danger of losing life stimulates its earlier\r\ndevelopment. Occasionally in persons who have tried to commit suicide,\r\na strong instinct of life wakens suddenly, and impels them to make\r\nfrantic efforts to escape.\r\n\r\nIt happens, therefore, that the sense of life develops sometimes in\r\nhealthy people, sometimes in those who suffer from acute or chronic\r\ndisease. These variations are parallel with the development of the\r\nsexual instinct, which in some women is completely absent and in others\r\ndevelops only very late. In certain cases, it is awakened only by\r\nspecial conditions, such as child-birth, or even some defect of health.\r\n\r\nAs the sense of life can be developed, special pains ought to be taken\r\nwith it, just as with the making perfect of the other senses in the\r\nblind. Young people who are inclined to pessimism ought to be informed\r\nthat their condition of mind is only temporary, and that according to\r\nthe laws of human nature it will later on be replaced by optimism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART VIII\r\n\r\nGOETHE AND FAUST\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGOETHE’S YOUTH\r\n\r\n  Goethe’s youth—Pessimism of youth—Werther—Tendency to\r\n  suicide—Work and love—Goethe’s conception of life in\r\n  his maturity\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be drawn from analysis of the lives of great men information\r\nthat is very important in the study of the constitution of man. I have\r\nchosen Goethe for several reasons. He was a man of genius distinguished\r\nby the comprehensive character of his ability. He was a poet and\r\ndramatist of the highest rank, his mind was stored with the most\r\nvaried knowledge, and he contributed to the advancement of natural\r\nscience. As minister of state and as the director of a theatre, he was\r\noccupied with practical affairs. He reached the age of eighty-three\r\nyears, and he passed through the phases of life in relatively normal\r\ncircumstances; in his many writings there are most valuable facts which\r\nthrow a keen light on his life and nature. The Goethe cult in Germany\r\nhas brought about the existence of fuller biographical details than\r\nexist regarding any other great man. He aspired to lead “the higher\r\nlife,” and, throughout his existence, he occupied himself with the most\r\nserious problems of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that Goethe became a subject of investigation for\r\nme, but as the main facts as to his history are widely known I need not\r\nelaborate them here.\r\n\r\nGoethe was reared in circumstances that were favourable in every\r\nrespect, and from his earliest years showed remarkable traits. As his\r\nmemory was good and his imagination vast, the study of ancient and\r\nmodern languages and the routine curriculum of a classical education\r\nwere little more than an amusement to him. The rich library of his\r\nfather placed all sorts of books at his disposal, and whilst he was\r\nstill young he devoted himself to reading with the enthusiasm and\r\npassion that were the chief qualities of his character. When he was\r\nfifteen years old he began to write verses, although he was still\r\nunconscious of his destiny as a poet. He intended to be a learned man,\r\nand looked forward to the career of a professor.\r\n\r\nAt the age of sixteen, he entered the University of Leipzig with the\r\nintention of studying natural science seriously. Law and philosophy\r\ninterested him but little; he turned to natural science and medicine,\r\nalthough his actual study was rather superficial. His disposition was\r\nlively and restless; he made many friends, frequented the theatre\r\nand plunged into all kinds of gaiety. Extracts from letters he wrote\r\nduring this period show the kind of life he led. When he was a student,\r\neighteen years old, he wrote to a friend, “And so good-night; I am\r\ndrunk as a hog.” A month later, to the same friend, he summed up his\r\nlife as a “delirium in the arms of Jetty.”\r\n\r\nHe graduated in law at Strassburg, and became a barrister, but\r\nrealising that such a career was unsuitable, he became a man of\r\nletters, encouraged by the success of his first literary efforts.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of a writer, he sought all kinds of experiences.\r\nHe devoted himself to literature and science, including even the\r\noccult sciences, and frequented the theatre and society. He was\r\nspecially attracted by the imaginative side and gave little thought to\r\nthe problems of science. “I must have movement,” he wrote in one of his\r\nnote-books.\r\n\r\nWhen he was young, his temper was violent and he fell into fits of\r\npassionate rage. His contemporaries have related that when he was in\r\nsuch a condition he would destroy the illustrations and tear up the\r\nbooks on his work-table. These experiences have been vividly described\r\nin his famous romance, _The Sorrows of Werther_. I shall give a few\r\nextracts to show the exact state of mind of the young pessimist. “It is\r\nthe fate of some men not to be understood.” “Human life is a dream; I\r\nam not the first to say that, but the idea haunts me. When I reflect on\r\nthe narrow limits which circumscribe the powers of man, his activities\r\nand intelligence; when I see how we exhaust our forces in satisfying\r\nour wants and that these wants are for no more than the prolongation\r\nof a miserable existence; that our acquiescence in so much is merely\r\nresignation engendered by dreams, like that of a prisoner who has\r\ncovered the walls of his cell with pictures and new landscapes; such\r\nthings, my friend, plunge me into silence.” “Our learned teachers\r\nall agree that children do not know why they have desires; but that\r\ngrown men should move on the earth like children, and, like these, be\r\nignorant whence they have come and whither they go, like these strive\r\nlittle for real things, but be ruled by cakes and sweets and rods; no\r\none will believe such things, though their truth is patent. I admit\r\nreadily (for I know what you will say) that they are the happiest men\r\nwho live from day to day like children, who play with their dolls,\r\ndress them and undress them, who reverence the cupboard where mamma\r\nkeeps the gingerbread, and who, when they have got what they wish,\r\ncry, with their mouths full, ‘How happy we are!’”\r\n\r\nWerther proclaimed his pessimism before his romance with Charlotte, and\r\nit was his view of life that made his love-affair turn out unhappily.\r\nBut the fame of Goethe’s _Werther_ was due, not to the tragic fate\r\nof the young lover, but to the general views which were in harmony\r\nwith the conception of the world held by the best minds of the time.\r\nByronism was born before Byron.\r\n\r\n_Werther_ affords a good illustration of the disharmonies in the\r\ndevelopment of man’s psychical nature. Inclination and desires develop\r\nextremely strongly and before will. Just as in the development of\r\nthe reproductive functions, as I showed in _The Nature of Man_, the\r\ndifferent factors develop unequally and unharmoniously, so there is\r\ninequality and disharmony in the order of the appearance of the higher\r\npsychical faculties. Sexual appreciation and a vague attraction to\r\nthe other sex appear at a time when there can be no possibility of\r\nthe normal physical side of sex, with the result that many evils come\r\nabout in the long period of youth. The precocious development of\r\nsensibility brings about a kind of diffused hyperæsthesia which may\r\nlead to trouble. The infant wishes to lay hold of everything he sees\r\nbefore him; he stretches out his arms to grasp the moon and suffers\r\nfrom his inability to gratify his desires. In youth there is still\r\nwell-marked disharmony. Young people cannot realise the true relations\r\nof things, and formulate their desires before they understand that\r\ntheir will-power is not strong enough to gratify them, as will is the\r\nlatest of the human powers to develop.\r\n\r\nWerther fell in love with a kindred spirit and gave way to his passion\r\nwithout consideration of the difficulties, Charlotte being already\r\nbetrothed to another. This is the plot of the tragedy of the young\r\nman, who committed suicide, having given way to pessimism. He had not\r\nthe will-power to conquer his sentiments and so fell into a state of\r\nlassitude, until, weary of life, he could see no other end than to blow\r\nout his brains.\r\n\r\nI need not linger over the last phase of the story of Werther, for it\r\nis the character of Goethe himself that is of interest. Goethe was\r\nable to subdue his passion for Lotte, and, after many amorous woes,\r\nconsoled himself with another woman. Notwithstanding this difference,\r\nit is certain that in _Werther_, Goethe was telling part of the story\r\nof his own youth. Goethe himself is a witness to this, for in a letter\r\nto Kestner he wrote that “he was at work on the artistic reproduction\r\nof his own case.” The letter was written in July, 1773, whilst Goethe,\r\nthen a writer twenty-four years old, was relating the sorrows of young\r\nWerther.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency of _Werther_ has been described excellently\r\nby Carlyle.[190] “_Werther_,” he wrote, “is but the cry of that\r\ndim, rooted pain, under which all thoughtful men of a certain age\r\nwere languishing; it paints the misery, it passionately utters the\r\ncomplaint; and heart and voice, all over Europe, loudly and at once\r\nresponded to it.” Werther was “the first thrilling peal of that\r\nimpassioned dirge which, in country after country, men’s ears have\r\nlistened to, till they were deaf to all else.”\r\n\r\nIn the pessimistic period of his life, Goethe often cherished the idea\r\nof suicide. In his biography he relates that at this time he used to\r\nhave, by his bedside, a poisoned dagger, and that he had repeatedly\r\ntried to plunge it in his bosom. Of these times he wrote to his friend\r\nZelter[191]—“I know what it has cost me in effort to resist the waves\r\nof death.” The suicide which was the subject of the end of his romance\r\nmade a deep impression upon him. Although he overcame his passion\r\nfor Charlotte, his view of life remained tinged with pessimism for\r\nmany years; in a note-book of 1773, for instance, he wrote “I am not\r\nmade for this world.”[192] These words are the more striking as they\r\ndate from a period when exact ideas regarding the adaptation of the\r\norganism and the character to the environment did not exist. Goethe,\r\nwith his too delicate sensibility, felt himself out of harmony with his\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\nIt is very interesting to trace Goethe’s subsequent development and\r\nthe transformation of a youthful pessimist into a convinced optimist.\r\nGoethe found a remedy for his crises of grief in work, poetical\r\ncreation and love. He declared that the mere describing his woes on\r\npaper brought assuagement. The tears that they shed console women and\r\nchildren; and the poetry in which he expresses his suffering consoles\r\nthe poet. Goethe’s romance with Charlotte was not quite at an end when\r\nhe found himself ready to love her sister Helen. He wrote to Kestner in\r\nDecember, 1772:—“I was about to ask you if Helen had arrived, when I\r\ngot the letter telling me of her return.” “To judge from her portrait\r\nshe must be charming, even more charming than Charlotte. Well, I am\r\nfree and I am thirsting for love.” “I am here at Frankfort again with\r\nnew plans and new dreams, and all will be well if I find someone to\r\nlove.” Soon afterwards, in another letter to Kestner, he wrote:—“Tell\r\nCharlotte that I have found here a girl whom I love with all my heart;\r\nif I wanted to marry, I should choose her before anyone else.”\r\n\r\nAs he had not yet realised his true vocation, Goethe became a court\r\nminister at Weimar. He devoted himself to his duties with an\r\nenthusiasm that carried him far beyond the usual affairs of state.\r\nHe wished to deepen his knowledge of such administrative problems as\r\nthe construction of roads and the management of mines, and he studied\r\ngeology and mineralogy with a real zest. Forest administration and\r\nagriculture led him seriously into botany, and as he had the direction\r\nof a school of design, he thought it necessary to learn anatomy.\r\nSuch varied work gave him a real taste for science. It was no longer\r\nthe superficial interest that characterised his work at Leipzig and\r\nStrassburg but a true devotion which led him to important discoveries,\r\nsome of which have become classic.\r\n\r\nEven such varied occupations did not absorb his prodigious genius. In\r\nhis leisure he wrote poetry and prose. Engrossed in so much work, he\r\nwas happy. His discovery of the human intermaxillary bone suffused him\r\nwith joy. His intense activity was strengthened by his love for Madame\r\nvon Stein, a love that he declared was “a life-belt supporting him in\r\nthe sea.” A few hours with her in the evenings set free his soul.\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence of love on the life of Goethe was specially\r\nprominent in this period when he was passing from pessimistic youth to\r\noptimistic maturity. Being forced to separate from Madame von Stein,\r\nhe gave way to grief that plunged him again in the worst hours of his\r\nlife. At the age of thirty-seven he fell back into a crisis like that\r\nof the days of _Werther_. “I have discovered,” he said in 1786, “that\r\nthe author of _Werther_ would have done well to blow out his brains\r\nwhen he had finished his work.” Soon afterwards he wrote that “death\r\nwould have been better than the last years of his life.”\r\n\r\nThis relapse into pessimism was shorter and less acute than his first\r\nexperience. He began to find that frequently his delight in existence\r\nand sense of life were proved by his fear of death. When he was little\r\nmore than thirty years old, he began to take precautions against the\r\nchance of his death. He wrote to Lavater:—“I have no time to lose; I\r\nam already getting on in years, and it may be that fate will destroy\r\nme in the midst of my life.” On all sides his wish to live and his\r\nshrinking from death reveal themselves. It was at this time, a few\r\ndays after his thirty-first birthday, that he wrote those famous\r\nlines, counted amongst the finest of his poetry, on the summit of\r\nthe Gickelhahn, on the wall of a small room, and which end with the\r\npresentiment of his own death, “Before long, you also will be at rest.”\r\n\r\nThe crisis through which he passed at the age of thirty-seven, as the\r\nimmediate result of his separation from Madame von Stein, but perhaps\r\nalso partly due to brain fatigue, brought about his sudden departure\r\nfrom Weimar and his long sojourn in Italy. There he came to life again,\r\nand everything interested him, archæology, art and nature. The joy of\r\nlife came back to him, and he soon consoled himself for the lost love\r\nof the blue-stocking Baroness in the arms of a pretty, blue-eyed girl\r\nof Milan. This girl, whose name was Maddalena Riggi, like Charlotte,\r\nwas already betrothed, a circumstance, however, that had a different\r\nresult. Even after she had given up the man to whom she had been\r\nengaged, Goethe avoided any permanent bond and soon abandoned her\r\ndefinitely. He chose to associate with Faustine, another Italian girl,\r\nwith whom he lived during the last period of his stay at Rome. This\r\naffair, which was less ideal and much simpler than his love for Madame\r\nvon Stein, he has described in his _Roman Elegies_, which throw a vivid\r\nlight on his temperament. I shall give some characteristic extracts.\r\n\r\n“A sacred enthusiasm inspires me on this classic soil; the old world\r\nand the world around me raise their voices and draw me to them.\r\nHere I follow the ideas and turn over the pages of the ancient\r\nwriters, giving myself no rest whilst day lasts and ever reaching new\r\ndelights. By night love calls me to other cares; and if I am only half\r\na philosopher, I am twice happy. But may I not say that I am also\r\nlearning when my eye follows the contours of a loving breast, when with\r\nmy hand I trace the lines of her form? It is then that I understand\r\nmarble, I think and compare, I see with an eye that touches and touch\r\nwith a hand that sees.” “Often I have made verses in her arms; often\r\nmy playful finger has softly beaten out my hexameters on her back. As\r\nshe breathes in her sweet sleep, her breath burns me to my innermost\r\nsoul.”[193]\r\n\r\nHis stay in Italy brought Goethe definitely to maturity. On this\r\nimportant stage in his life let us hear his biographer, Bielschowsky.\r\n“The voyage to Italy made a new man of him. His sickliness and\r\nnervousness disappeared. The melancholy which led him to think of early\r\ndeath and made him regard death as better than the former conditions\r\nof his life was replaced by a sublime serenity and joy in living. The\r\ntaciturn and preoccupied man who in no society abandoned his grave\r\nthoughts had become happy as a child” (vol. i, p. 412). “From this\r\ntime on, in calm and enviable security, he passed through the cycle of\r\nlife which seemed so mysterious to others. Goethe became the serene\r\nOlympian, the wonder of posterity, whilst many of his contemporaries no\r\nlonger saw in him the passionate pilgrim” (_ibid._, p. 417).\r\n\r\nIt was after reaching the age of forty years that Goethe entered on the\r\noptimistic phase of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nGOETHE AND OPTIMISM\r\n\r\n  Goethe’s optimistic period—His mode of life\r\n  in that period—Influence of love in artistic\r\n  production—Inclinations towards the arts must be\r\n  regarded as secondary sexual characters—Senile love of\r\n  Goethe—Relation between genius and the sexual activities\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moral equilibrium of the great writer was not established once\r\nfor all. In the course of his life, Goethe had several relapses into\r\npessimism which, however, were ephemeral, and after which he became a\r\nman as complete and harmonious as was possible in the circumstances of\r\nhis life. He reached a serene old age, and his activity did not relax\r\nuntil after his eightieth year, when he died.\r\n\r\nAs I have already said, Goethe realised the value of life in good\r\ntime. Having become an optimist, he experienced the joy of existence\r\nand coveted as much of it as possible. When he was an old man, he\r\ndeclared that life, like the Sibylline books, became more valuable\r\nthe fewer of them were left. There appeared in him a normal phase of\r\nhuman nature. The conditions under which he lived, however, were far\r\nfrom ideal. His health was indifferent. In his youth he suffered from\r\nsevere hæmorrhage, probably tuberculous, and throughout his life he was\r\nsubject to various more or less serious maladies, such as gout, colic,\r\nnephritis, and intestinal troubles. His habits were unwholesome. He\r\nwas brought up in a region of vineyards, and in his youth he acquired\r\nthe habit of drinking wine in quantities certainly harmful. This he\r\nhimself realised, and when he was thirty-one years old, after he had\r\nacquired the instinct of life, he gave it serious attention. “I wish I\r\ncould abstain from wine,” he wrote in his note-book. Some weeks later\r\nhe wrote, “I now drink almost no wine.”[194]\r\n\r\nBut he had not the strength of character to remain temperate, and soon\r\nafter his decision, he had fits of bleeding at the nose, which he\r\nattributed to “having taken some glasses of wine.”[195] To his last\r\nday, he took wine regularly, and sometimes to excess. J. H. Wolff,\r\nwho dined with him at Weimar, when he was in his eightieth year, was\r\nsurprised by his appetite and by the quantity of wine he drank. “In\r\naddition to other food, he ate an enormous portion of roast goose, and\r\ndrank a bottle of red wine.”[196] In Eckermann’s interesting narrative\r\nof the last ten years of Goethe’s life (1822-1832) there is repeated\r\nmention of wine. Goethe seized every occasion to drink it. Sometimes\r\nit was the visit of a stranger, sometimes a present of some famous\r\nvintage. It was said that he drank from one to two bottles of wine\r\ndaily (Moebius). None the less, he was convinced that wine was not good\r\nfor intellectual work. He had remarked that when his friend Schiller\r\nhad drunk more than usual, to increase his strength and stimulate his\r\nliterary activity, the result was deplorable. He said to Eckermann\r\n(March 11, 1828), “He will ruin his health and will spoil his work.\r\nThat is why he has made the faults the critics have pointed out.” In\r\nanother conversation (March 11, 1828) he stated that what was written\r\nunder the influence of wine was abnormal and forced, and ought to be\r\ndeleted.\r\n\r\nLove was the great stimulus of Goethe’s genius. The love affairs,\r\nthe histories of which fill his biography, are well known. Many have\r\nbeen shocked by them; others have tried to justify them. It has been\r\nsuggested that his disposition made it necessary for him to impart his\r\nideas and obtain sympathy for them, and that his love for women was the\r\nexpression of a purely artistic feeling and had nothing in common with\r\nthe ordinary passion.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that artistic genius and perhaps all kinds of genius are\r\nclosely associated with sexual activity. I agree with the proposition\r\nformulated by Dr. Moebius[197] that “artistic proclivities are probably\r\nto be regarded as secondary sexual characters.” Just as the beard\r\nand some other male characters are developed as means of attracting\r\nthe female sex, so also bodily strength, strong voice and many of\r\nthe talents must be regarded as due to the need to fulfil the sexual\r\nrelations. In primitive conditions woman worked more than man; man’s\r\nsuperior force served him principally in fighting with other males, the\r\nobject of the combats usually being possession of a woman. Just as a\r\nvictorious combatant covets the presence of a woman as witness of his\r\nprowess, so an orator speaks better in the presence of a woman to whom\r\nhe is devoted. Singers and poets are stimulated in their arts by the\r\nlove they awaken. Poetic genius is intimately associated with sexual\r\npower and castration inhibits it. Just as castrated animals retain\r\ntheir physical strength, but become changed in character, losing in\r\nparticular their combative nature, so a man of genius loses much of\r\nhis quality with the sexual function. Amongst the eunuchs on record,\r\nAbelard is the only poet, but Abelard was forty years old when he\r\nceased to be a man, and at the same time he ceased to be a poet. Many\r\nsingers have been eunuchs, but they have been merely executants, and\r\nhave taken no part in musical creation. Some musical composers have\r\nbeen eunuchs, but these were of mediocre ability and their names have\r\nbeen forgotten. When castration has taken place at an early age, it\r\nhas a much more powerful influence in modifying the secondary sexual\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of a naturalist, I cannot agree with the\r\nmoralists who have blamed Goethe for his sexuality, nor do I share the\r\nviews of those defenders of him who have wished to deny the facts or to\r\nexplain them away by the suggestion that they did not relate to sexual\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nExtracts from the _Roman Elegies_ show quite clearly what was the\r\nnature of Goethe’s love affairs. His feelings towards the Baroness von\r\nStein have been taken as revealing merely idealistic love. But some of\r\nhis letters to her are clear evidence that their relations were erotic\r\n(Moebius, _Goethe_, vol. ii, p. 89). The love which he bore for Minna\r\nHerzlieb, the girl who inspired him to write _Elective Affinities_\r\n(_Wahlverwandschaften_), has been described by Goethe himself in a poem\r\nso crudely erotic that it has been impossible to publish it (Lewes,\r\nvol. ii, p. 314).\r\n\r\nA fact to which I specially desire to call attention is that Goethe’s\r\namorous temperament survived until the end of his life, and all the\r\nworld has been astonished by the vigour of his poetic genius in extreme\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nGoethe has been the subject of derision because at the age of\r\nseventy-four years he fell deeply in love with Ulrique de Lewetzow, who\r\nwas quite a young girl. This incident, however, merits close attention\r\nas it is a typical case of senile love in a man of genius.\r\n\r\nWhilst he was at Carlsbad, Goethe became acquainted with a pretty girl\r\nseventeen years old, with beautiful blue eyes, brown hair, and of an\r\nardent, good-humoured and happy disposition. In the first two seasons\r\nnothing in particular happened. But in the third summer, at Marienbad,\r\nGoethe became passionately enamoured of Ulrique, who was then nineteen\r\nyears old and in the full bloom of her young womanhood. His love made\r\nhim young again; he passed long hours with her and took to dancing with\r\nher. “I am quite certain,” he wrote to his son, “that it is many years\r\nsince I have enjoyed such health of body and mind” (Aug. 30, 1823). His\r\npassion became so serious that the Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar, on behalf\r\nof his friend, made a formal proposal of marriage for Mademoiselle de\r\nLewetzow. The mother gave an evasive answer, and the matter rested\r\nin suspense for long, and ended in a refusal. Goethe withdrew to his\r\nfamily, but encountered there strong opposition to his project of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nThis misadventure troubled the old poet so seriously that he fell ill.\r\nHe suffered from pain in the region of the heart and from profound\r\nmental disturbance. He complained to Eckermann “that he could do\r\nnothing, that he could get to work on nothing, and that his mind had\r\nlost its power.” “I can no longer work,” he said. “I cannot even read,\r\nand it is only in rare and fortunate moments that I can think, feeling\r\nmyself partially soothed” (Eckermann, Nov. 16, 1823). Eckermann makes\r\nthe following reflection on the state of mind of the great old man.\r\n“His trouble seems to be not merely physical. The passionate desire\r\nwhich he acquired for a young lady at Marienbad this summer, and\r\nagainst which he is still struggling, must be regarded as the chief\r\ncause of his illness” (Nov. 17, 1823).\r\n\r\nAs in all earlier crises, Goethe sought consolation in poetry and\r\nlove. He left Marienbad in a carriage and began to set down verses\r\nastonishingly vigorous for so old a man. His Marienbad elegy is held to\r\nbe one of the best of his poetical achievements. The following extracts\r\nwill give an idea of his state of mind at that period.\r\n\r\n“I am lost in unconquerable desire; there is nothing left but\r\neverlasting tears. Let them flow, let them flow unceasingly. But they\r\ncan never extinguish the fire that burns me. My heart rages; it is\r\ntorn in pieces, this heart where life and death meet in a horrible\r\ncombat.” “I have lost the universe, I have lost myself, I who until now\r\nhave been the favourite of the gods; they have put me to the question,\r\nthey offered me Pandora, rich in treasure and still richer in perilous\r\nseductions; they made me drunken with the kisses of her mouth, which\r\ngave me its sweets; they have torn me from her arms, and have struck me\r\nwith death.”\r\n\r\nGoethe concealed his elegy for some time, guarding it as something\r\nsacred, but eventually handed it over to Eckermann. Poetic creation\r\nsoothed his mind only for a time. His nature demanded some more\r\nefficacious consolation. A few weeks after the separation he began to\r\ncomplain bitterly of the absence of the Countess Julie von Egloffstein,\r\nwhom he wanted very much. “She cannot know what she is keeping from me\r\nand what she makes me lose, nor can she know how I love her and how\r\nshe engrosses my mind.” He derived a little comfort from the visits of\r\nMadame Szymanowska, whom he admired “not only as a great artist, but\r\nas a pretty woman” (Eckermann, Nov. 3, 1823). “I am deeply grateful\r\nto this charming woman,” he said to the chancellor, “for her beauty,\r\nher sweetness, and her art have soothed my passionate heart” (Bode, p.\r\n151). He also renewed his relations with Marianne Jung, the retired\r\nactress and dancer. “When Goethe had to turn his thoughts from Ulrique,\r\nthe image of the pretty owner of Gerbermühle again occupied his mind. A\r\nvisit to her, and intimate correspondence with her, restored peace to\r\nhis heart so greedy of love” (Bielschowsky, vol. ii, p. 487).\r\n\r\nHis devotion to Ulrique was Goethe’s last acute attack of love; but\r\nuntil the end of his days he felt the need of being surrounded by\r\npretty women. As director of the theatre, he came in contact with many\r\nyoung women who wished engagements. He confessed to Eckermann that he\r\nrequired much strength of mind to resist feminine charms which tempted\r\nhim to be unjustly favourable to the prettiest of those who sought\r\nemployment. “If I allowed myself to fall into an intrigue of gallantry,\r\nI would become like a demagnetised needle as soon as the girl found a\r\nreal lover” (Eckermann, March 22, 1825).\r\n\r\nHis daughter-in-law’s sister has related that Goethe liked to have\r\nyoung girls in his study whilst he was at work. They had to sit\r\nquietly, neither working nor talking, often a difficult task for them\r\n(Bode, p. 155).\r\n\r\nEven on the last day of his life, whilst in delirium, he cried out,\r\n“What a pretty woman’s head with black curls on a black ground” (Lewes,\r\nvol. ii, p. 372). After uttering several other more or less incoherent\r\nphrases, he drew his last breath.\r\n\r\nThe facts which I described in the chapter of this book dealing with\r\nold age have made clear how long sexuality persists in men. As the\r\ntestes resist atrophy better than other organs, and even in extreme old\r\nage still form active spermatozoa, it is natural that their condition\r\nshould be reflected on the organism generally, and that feelings of\r\nlove should still be excited. If by some accident Goethe had become\r\na eunuch early in life, he would have been a different being. The\r\nmoralists who have been shocked by his amorous intrigues would have\r\nbeen satisfied, but the world would have lost a great poet. Moreover,\r\nGoethe is no exceptional case amongst writers. The temperament of\r\nVictor Hugo and his devotion to women up to the end of his days are\r\nwell known. More recently, after the death of Ibsen, a profound\r\nsensation was made by the revelation of his love for Mademoiselle\r\nBardach, who inspired his genius during the last period of his life.\r\n\r\nNot only poetic creation but other forms of genius are intimately\r\nassociated with the sexual function. The philosopher Schopenhauer, who\r\nwas no ascetic, wrote as follows, at the age of twenty-five, when he\r\nwas in full creative activity, “In the days and at the hours when the\r\nvoluptuous instinct is strongest, when it is a burning covetousness,\r\nit is then that the greatest forces of the mind and the greatest\r\nstores of knowledge are ready for the most intense activity.” “At\r\nsuch moments life is truly at its strongest and most active, for its\r\ntwo poles are then operating most actively; and this is plain in the\r\nman of the highest intelligence. In these hours one sees more than in\r\nyears of passivity” (quoted in Moebius’ _Schopenhauer_, p. 55). “This\r\nmeans that in Schopenhauer intellectual creation was linked with erotic\r\nexcitement” (_ibid._, p. 57).\r\n\r\nIt was facts of such a nature that led Brown-Séquard to his idea of\r\nstrengthening cerebral activity by injections of the substance of\r\ntestes. To obtain the same effect, he prescribed another means, the\r\nvalue of which was proved in the case of two individuals aged from\r\nforty-five to fifty years, the observations being continued over\r\nseveral years. “By my advice,” he said, “when these had to perform\r\nany great physical or intellectual work, they got themselves into a\r\ncondition of sexual excitement.” “The testes being in this way thrown\r\ninto functional activity, there was soon produced the desired increase\r\nin the power of the nerve centres.”[198]\r\n\r\nAlthough I insist on the existence of a close relation between\r\nintellectual activity and the sexual function, I do not mean to assert\r\nthat there have not existed exceptions to the rule.\r\n\r\nNow that I have described certain important factors in the genius of\r\nGoethe, I shall pass on to a study of his state of mind in the last\r\nperiod of his life, the splendour and harmony of which have been so\r\noften admired.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nGOETHE’S OLD AGE\r\n\r\n  Old age of Goethe—Physical and intellectual vigour of\r\n  the old man—Optimistic conception of life—Happiness in\r\n  life in his last period\r\n\r\n\r\nDrinkers of wine may take the case of Goethe as an argument against\r\ntemperance. Although he was not healthy in his youth, his large\r\nconsumption of wine did not prevent him from enjoying an old age full\r\nof force and intellectual work. Eckermann, who was his intimate and\r\nconstant companion in the last ten years of his life, was never weary\r\nof expressing his surprise and delight at the physical and moral vigour\r\nof the distinguished old man. He found Goethe on his return to Jena,\r\nat the age of seventy-four, in a condition “very pleasant to see; he\r\nwas in good health and robust, so that he could walk for hours” (Sept.\r\n15, 1823). His eyes were “brilliant and clear and his whole expression\r\nwas that of joy, vigour and youth” (Oct. 29). In walks with Eckermann,\r\nGoethe forced the pace and showed strength which filled his companion\r\nwith delight (March, 1824). His voice was full of character and of\r\nforce (March 30, 1824), and every word showed his vitality (July 9,\r\n1827).\r\n\r\nIn a conversation that Eckermann had with Goethe when the latter was\r\nseventy-nine years old “the sound of his voice and the fire in his eyes\r\nwere of such strength as would have been normal in the full flush\r\nof youth” (Mar. 11, 1828). Such characters were preserved until the\r\nend of the life of the great man, and a few months before his death\r\nEckermann jotted in his book that he saw him every day in full vigour\r\nand freshness, looking as if his health might be prolonged indefinitely\r\n(Dec. 21, 1831). In the beginning of the following spring, Goethe\r\ncaught a feverish cold, possibly pneumonic, and died, probably from\r\nweakness of the heart. His illness lasted a week. If he had not been a\r\ndrinker of wine he would have been able to withstand this attack and to\r\nlive still longer.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual vigour of Goethe was even greater and more remarkable\r\nthan his physical strength. His interests were extremely wide, and his\r\nthirst for knowledge was never appeased. Once, when he was absorbed\r\nby the interest of hearing d’Alton describe in detail the skeleton of\r\nrodents, Eckermann states his surprise that a man not far short of\r\neighty years old “did not give up seeking for and gaining knowledge.”\r\nBut in these matters he never lost his interest. He wished always to go\r\nfurther and further, always to learn, so showing himself to be a man\r\nof eternal and undying youth (April 16, 1825). Goethe’s aptitude for\r\nunderstanding and his memory were most unusual. When he was more than\r\neighty, he surprised those who heard him “by the incessant flow of his\r\nideas and by his extraordinary fertility in invention” (Oct. 7, 1828).\r\n\r\n“The old age of Goethe is the most striking proof of the extreme force\r\nof his constitution,” said his medical biographer, Dr. Moebius. Works\r\nwhich were written in his last years are for the most part beyond\r\npraise, both because of their finished form, and by their wisdom and\r\nfeeling. What other man of eighty has written anything of the same\r\ncharacter? From the physiological point of view I am more surprised\r\nat his works when he was old than at those of his youthful activity”\r\n(Moebius, _Goethe_, i, 200, 201).\r\n\r\nAlthough Goethe’s character, which was fiery and intense in his youth,\r\nbecame much more calm with age, there still came to him moments when\r\nhe was carried away. He had certain eccentricities of an old man, and\r\nin particular was often very despotic, and this trait has been the\r\noccasion of many stories. His temper, however, became much more certain\r\nin his old age, and his general conceptions much more optimistic.\r\nApart from certain short crises, he was happy in his life. In 1828, he\r\nsettled down at Dornburg and there passed a tranquil existence. “I stay\r\nout of doors nearly all day and engage in private conversations with\r\nthe tendrils of the vine which communicate their excellent ideas to\r\nme, ideas about which I shall have marvellous things to tell you”—he\r\nwrote to Eckermann on June 15, 1828—“I am composing verses which are\r\nquite good, and I hope that it will be given to me to live long in\r\nthis condition. I am quite contented,” he said to his collaborator,\r\n“at the beginning of spring, when I see the first green leaves, I am\r\npleased to watch how, from week to week, one leaf after another appears\r\non the stem. I am delighted in May, when I see a flower-bud; I feel\r\nreally happy, when in June the rose offers to me its splendour and its\r\nperfume” (Eckermann, April 27, 1825). His delight in life at this epoch\r\nis also revealed in many letters. “I wish to whisper this in your ear,”\r\nhe wrote to Zelter on April 29, 1830. “I am delighted to find that even\r\nat my great age, ideas come to me the pursuit and development of which\r\nwould require a second life.”\r\n\r\nHis conception of life had changed enormously since the epoch of\r\n_Werther_. Goethe himself said: “When one is old, one thinks many\r\nthings about this world quite different from when one was young”\r\n(Eckermann, Dec., 1829). The youthful sensitiveness which had brought\r\nhim so much suffering was notably dulled. Eckermann was astonished\r\nat the way he accepted wounds to his pride. It happened that his\r\ndesign for the new theatre at Weimar was abandoned while it was being\r\nconstructed, and replaced by another not his own work. Eckermann\r\nwas much disturbed by this, and went to see Goethe in a state of\r\napprehension. “I was afraid,” he said, “that so unexpected a step\r\nwould profoundly wound Goethe. Well, there was nothing of the sort;\r\nI found him in the best of tempers, quite calm, absolutely above all\r\nfeelings in the matter.” When he had reached his eighty-fourth year,\r\nGoethe had no weariness of life. In his last illness, he showed not\r\nthe smallest desire to die. He expected to get better, and thought\r\nthat the approach of summer would restore his strength. The desire to\r\nlive was strong in him. None the less, he recognised that his cycle of\r\nlife was finished, and although he had no weariness of life, he felt\r\na kind of satisfaction that life was over. “When, like me, a man has\r\nlived eighty years,” he said, “he has hardly the right to live, but\r\nought to be ready every day to die, and to think of putting his house\r\nin order” (Eckermann, May 15, 1831). None the less, he continued his\r\nwork, in particular revising the last two chapters of the second part\r\nof _Faust_. When he had finished them, Goethe was extremely pleased. “I\r\ncan consider,” he said, “any days which come to me yet as a real gift,\r\nas it is a matter of no moment if I write anything more or what such\r\nwork should be” (Eckermann, June 1, 1831).\r\n\r\nGoethe gave Faust one hundred years of life, and it is probable that he\r\nthought of that period as his own span. Although he did not reach it,\r\nhe approached it, after having lived a most active life, full of most\r\nvaluable lessons for posterity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nGOETHE AND “FAUST”\r\n\r\n  _Faust_ the biography of Goethe—The three monologues\r\n  in the first Part—Faust’s pessimism—The brain-fatigue\r\n  which finds a remedy in love—The romance with Marguerite\r\n  and its unhappy ending\r\n\r\n\r\n“Goethe was Faust, Faust Goethe,” said the biographer of the great\r\npoet (Bielschowsky, vol. ii, p. 645). Most people admit that in\r\n_Faust_ Goethe gave his autobiography on a more detailed scale than\r\nin _Werther_. Why then should I follow my analysis of Goethe himself,\r\nwhich was based on exact facts, with an analysis of Faust? I do so\r\nbecause in addition to the biographical details in _Faust_, there are\r\nmany ideas which illuminate the poet’s conception of life. Goethe’s\r\nlife explains _Faust_, and _Faust_ explains the soul of its author.\r\nAnd I am convinced that an accurate study of so great a man is of high\r\nimportance in the investigation of human nature.\r\n\r\nThe two Parts of _Faust_ correspond with two distinct periods in\r\nGoethe’s life. In the first Part, Faust was pessimistic, in the second\r\noptimistic. Although many of the high problems that occupy humanity are\r\nraised and discussed in _Faust_, love is the centre on which the drama\r\nturns.\r\n\r\nIn the first Part, conceived and for the most part written during\r\nhis youth, the chief theme is the love of a young man for a pretty\r\nand attractive girl towards whom the hero acts in a fashion opposed\r\nto conventional morality. As in most of his principal works, Goethe\r\nhas made an episode in his own life the basis of _Faust_. It is the\r\nwell-known story of Frederique, the daughter of a clergyman, for\r\nwhom the brilliant young author conceived a violent passion and who\r\nreturned his affection with a deeper and more enduring feeling. Goethe\r\nwas alarmed at the possibility of definitely settling his future, and\r\ndeserted the poor victim of love in an unfortunate state. Later on, he\r\nconfessed to the Baroness von Stein that he had abandoned Frederique\r\nat a time when his desertion was likely to cause the death of the poor\r\ngirl. “I had wounded to the quick,” he wrote (Bielschowsky, vol. i, p.\r\n135), “the best heart in the world, and I had to repent of it long and\r\nalmost unendurably.” As an atonement, he made Frederique the heroine\r\nof “Goetz” and of “Clavigo,” but not thinking these worthy of her, he\r\nimmortalised her as the Marguerite of _Faust_.\r\n\r\nA learned doctor, skilled in all human knowledge, but who had found\r\nno satisfaction in his studies, found consolation in the beauty and\r\ncharm of a young girl with whom he fell passionately in love. It will\r\nbe interesting to trace the psychological process which induced him to\r\nleave the scene of his scientific studies for the streets and resorts\r\nwhere he found Marguerite.\r\n\r\nAlthough Faust was represented as an old man, who had had time enough\r\nto absorb all human learning, his image bears the stamp of green youth.\r\n“Discontented with all his knowledge, he wished to know the secret\r\nentrails of the world, to be a witness of the centre of all activity,\r\nto unveil the principle of life.”[199] These are the demands of a young\r\nman seeking to resolve the most intricate problems at one stroke. The\r\nspeech in question dates from the period of _Werther_, when Goethe\r\nwas twenty-five years old, and for that reason leaves no very serious\r\nimpression.[200] The second monologue, which ends with the attempt to\r\ntake poison, is later, and is absent in the edition of 1790 (Fragment).\r\nIt was revised when Goethe had reached his fiftieth year, and displays\r\na riper maturity. Although lacking exactness, it depicts in an\r\ninteresting fashion the miseries of life.\r\n\r\n  Some alien substance more and more is cleaving\r\n  To all the mind conceives of grand and fair;\r\n  When this world’s Good is won by our achieving,\r\n  The Better, then, is named a cheat and snare.\r\n  The fine emotions, whence our lives we mould,\r\n  Lie in the earthly tumult dumb and cold.\r\n  If hopeful Fancy once, in daring flight,\r\n  Her longings to the Infinite expanded,\r\n  Yet now a narrow space contents her quite,\r\n  Since Time’s wild wave so many a fortune stranded.\r\n  Care at the bottom of the heart is lurking;\r\n  Her secret pangs in silence working,\r\n  She, restless, rocks herself, disturbing joy and rest;\r\n  In newer masks her face is ever drest,\r\n  By turns as house and land, as wife and child, presented,—\r\n  As water, fire, as poison, steel;\r\n  We dread the blows we never feel,\r\n  And what we never lose is yet by us lamented.[201]\r\n\r\nFear of the evils which lie in wait for us and against which we can\r\nmake no provision render life insupportable. Faust’s frame of mind as\r\ndescribed in these lines recalls Schopenhauer, who was always afraid of\r\nsomething; fear, sometimes of thieves, sometimes of diseases, tormented\r\nhim. He would never go to a barber’s to be shaved, and always carried\r\nhis own drinking cup with him.\r\n\r\n“Is it not better to end such a life, and to kill oneself, even if it\r\nmean annihilation?” asked Faust. He took up the poisoned goblet and\r\nput it to his lips, but, arrested by singing and the sound of bells\r\noutside, he refrained, and life laid hold of him. Not religious faith,\r\nhowever, but memories of childhood, “the happy sports of youth and the\r\ngay festivals of spring” were the agencies that recalled Faust to the\r\nearth. He went out of doors, mingled with the crowd, tried to amuse\r\nhimself amongst men, and savoured the beauty of the new-born spring,\r\nbut all these could not make him forget the evil of life. He met his\r\npupil, talked with him, and again displayed his pessimism.\r\n\r\n  O happy he, who still renews\r\n  The hope, from Error’s deeps to rise for ever!\r\n  That which one does not know, one needs to use;\r\n  And what one knows, one uses never.[202]\r\n\r\nThen follows the celebrated monologue of Faust over which so many\r\ncommentators have lost their heads and wasted oceans of ink.\r\n\r\n  Two souls, alas! reside within my breast,\r\n  And each withdraws from, and repels, its brother.\r\n  One with tenacious organs holds in love\r\n  And clinging lust the world in its embraces;\r\n  The other strongly sweeps, this dust above,\r\n  Into the high ancestral spaces.[203]\r\n\r\nOn this passage has been built up a whole theory of “double natures”\r\nwith which has been incorporated the dualism of Manicheism, the two\r\nnatures of Christ and what not besides.[204]\r\n\r\nThere exists in literature no better expression of human disharmony\r\nthan this monologue “of the two souls.” It portrays the unbalanced\r\ncondition so frequent in youth and is a valuable indication of the real\r\nyouth of Faust.\r\n\r\nOn his return to his study, Faust again revealed his pessimism.\r\n\r\n  But ah! I feel, though will thereto be stronger,\r\n  Contentment flows from out my breast no longer.\r\n  Why must the stream so soon run dry and fail us,\r\n  And burning thirst again assail us?\r\n  Therein I’ve borne so much probation![205]\r\n\r\nIt is at this point that Faust addresses the Spirit “that denies” and\r\nthat is called “sin” and “evil.” This spirit invokes before his eyes\r\n“the fairest images of dreams,” that is to say, a woman’s body in its\r\nbeautiful nudity. Faust declares himself\r\n\r\n  Too old to play with passion,\r\n  Too young to be without desire.[206]\r\n\r\nPursued by desire\r\n\r\n  ... when night descends, how anxiously\r\n  Upon my couch of sleep I lay me.\r\n  There, also, comes no rest to me;\r\n  But some wild dream is sent to fray me.[207]\r\n\r\nSo that\r\n\r\n  Death is desired, and Life a thing unblest.\r\n  O fortunate, for whom, when victory glances,\r\n  The bloody laurels on the brow he bindeth!\r\n  Whom, after rapid, maddening dances,\r\n  In clasping maiden-arms he findeth![208]\r\n\r\nFaust thus reached the ecstasy of passion. Soon afterwards in the\r\nWitches’ kitchen, he saw in a mirror a “heavenly form” and cried:—\r\n\r\n  O lend me, Love, the swiftest of thy pinions,\r\n  And bear me to her beauteous field.\r\n\r\n  A woman’s form, in beauty shining!\r\n  Can woman, then, so lovely be?\r\n  And must I find her body, there reclining;\r\n  Of all the heavens, the bright epitome?\r\n  Can Earth with such a thing be mated?[209]\r\n\r\nDiscontent with life, sense of the insufficiency of human knowledge\r\nand the most gloomy pessimism lead to the passion of love which,\r\neventually, after many devious paths, throws Faust into the arms of\r\nMarguerite. The story is one of the world’s great romances and everyone\r\nknows it. Faust all unconsciously was following the prescription of\r\nBrown-Séquard. Brain-fatigue had made the continuation of the study\r\nwhich caused it impossible. The condition is plainly stated in the\r\nfollowing lines:—\r\n\r\n  The thread of Thought at last is broken,\r\n  And knowledge brings disgust unspoken.\r\n  Let us the sensual deeps explore.[210]\r\n\r\nThe brain has refused to work, and blind instinct, in the guise of\r\ndreams, whispers that there is in the organism something that can\r\nrestore the intellectual forces. This something, however, is what is\r\ncalled sin, and much courage is needed to plunge into it. Without this\r\nevil, life cannot last. Faust has to choose between love and death, and\r\nchooses love.\r\n\r\nThe end of the romance of Goethe and Frederique was bad, and that of\r\nFaust and Marguerite was still worse. The poet painted it in the most\r\nsombre colours. Marguerite killed her child, poisoned her mother,\r\nbecame crazy, and was beheaded. Faust’s cup of misery was filled to the\r\nbrim; he blamed his evil genius, he made desperate efforts to save the\r\npoor woman, and cried “O that I had never been born.”\r\n\r\nTo sum up: in the first Part, Faust is a young, learned man who\r\nexpects too much from science and life, and whose genius requires\r\nextra-conjugal love as a stimulant; he is unbalanced and inevitably\r\npessimistic. It is not surprising that his life goes badly, and that\r\nhis conduct leaves him much to repent of. But although, at first,\r\na vague general discontent nearly drives him to suicide, later on\r\nthe terrible evil which he had wrought on a poor creature he loved\r\npassionately did no more than plunge him into misery that was bitter\r\nbut far from mortal. His mind had developed far in the direction of\r\noptimism. The crisis through which he passed, serious as it was, ended\r\nby his return to a life of great activity and enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTHE OLD AGE OF FAUST\r\n\r\n  The second Part of _Faust_ is in the main a description\r\n  of senile love—Amorous passion of the old man—Humble\r\n  attitude of the old Faust—Platonic love for Helena—The\r\n  old Faust’s conception of life—His optimism—The general\r\n  idea of the play\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Part of _Faust_ was acclaimed by the world almost as soon as\r\nit appeared, but the second Part met a very cold reception. Everyone\r\nknows and reads the first Part; the second Part has few readers, and\r\nthese chiefly poets and dramatists. No doubt it has more effect on the\r\nstage than when it is read, but this is due to subsidiary features in\r\nwhich it resembles a fine ballet. There is general agreement that the\r\nreal meaning of the second Part is obscure, complex and difficult to\r\ninterpret. Many literary critics have racked their brains in the effort\r\nto discover the author’s central idea. When Eckermann, who persuaded\r\nGoethe to revise and finish the second Part, asked what was the meaning\r\nof some of the scenes in it, Goethe evaded the question and played the\r\nsphinx. Thus, with regard to the famous “mothers” Goethe answered,\r\nwith a mysterious air:—“You have the manuscript; study it, and see\r\nwhat you can make of it” (January 10, 1830). G. H. Lewes, although\r\none of Goethe’s most resolute admirers, admitted the impossibility\r\nof grasping the sense of the second Part. The Wanderjahre and the\r\nsecond Part of _Faust_ were arsenals of symbols, and it pleased the\r\nold poet to see acute critics labouring to interpret them whilst he\r\nwas silent and refused to help them. Lewes thought that Goethe, so far\r\nfrom showing the smallest wish to clear up their difficulties, took\r\na pleasure in giving them new problems to puzzle over. Lewes himself\r\nthought that the second Part was poor in idea and execution, and\r\nadmitted that he had failed after repeatedly trying to get a conception\r\nof it that would reveal its beauties. In writing about it, he contented\r\nhimself with giving a summary of it. Now this second Part, although its\r\ngeneral lines had been laid down for long, was actually written during\r\nseveral years in the last period of the poet’s life. The fact that it\r\nwas composed out of the regular sequence of the Acts and Scenes gives\r\nus an important clue. The third Act and then the second Part of the\r\nfifth Act were put on paper first. Next followed the first Act and part\r\nof the second; the classical Walpurgis night was written in 1830, the\r\nfourth Act in 1831, and last of all the beginning of the fifth Act.\r\n\r\nAs the second Part of _Faust_ is a crowded motley, containing many\r\nsubjects, obviously of minor importance, such as the volcanic theory\r\nof the earth and the disquisition on paper-money, the key-note may be\r\nfound in the portions which were first composed. Now Act III. contains\r\nthe story of Helena, and the second part of Act V. Faust’s activity for\r\nthe general welfare.\r\n\r\nSetting out from the conception that the works of Goethe reflect the\r\nacts and incidents of his own life, I shall try to explain on that\r\nbasis the meaning of the most obscure of his writings.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that love was the stimulus of Goethe’s activity\r\nin youth and age; it is the scarlet thread running through his\r\nhistory. There was no difficulty in his using his love for Frederique\r\nas material for a play; that a young man should love a young girl\r\nwas natural enough. The story of an old man enamoured of a young\r\nbeauty was quite another matter. It was said that one of the reasons\r\nthat prevented his marriage with Ulrique de Lewetzow was the fear of\r\nridicule (Lewes, _op. cit._, ii, p. 345), a fear that plays a large\r\npart in human affairs. It is easy to understand that the old poet was\r\nin a difficulty when he came to write of senile love. Faust’s love for\r\nHelena was not that of a supposed old man who became young by doffing\r\nhis beard and changing his cloak, but of a real old man whom no mystery\r\nnor magic was to make young again. And yet old Faust’s love was a true\r\npassion, and Goethe has written no finer lines than those describing it.\r\n\r\nWhen the second Part begins, Faust has passed through the terrible\r\ncrisis of the first Part. Wearied and restless, he seeks a new mode of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n  Life’s pulses now with fresher force awaken\r\n  To greet the mild ethereal twilight o’er me;\r\n  This night, thou, Earth! hast also stood unshaken,\r\n  And now thou breathest, new-refreshed before me,\r\n  And now beginnest, all thy gladness granting,\r\n  A vigorous resolution to restore me,\r\n  To seek that higher life for which I’m panting.[211]\r\n\r\nThe invoked image of the most beautiful woman in the history of the\r\nworld transforms Faust’s desire of love into an overwhelming passion.\r\n\r\n  Have I still eyes? Deep in my being springs\r\n  The fount of Beauty, in a torrent pouring!\r\n  A heavenly gain my path of terror brings.\r\n  The world was void, and shut to my exploring,—\r\n  And, since my priesthood, how hath it been graced!\r\n  Enduring 'tis, desirable, firm-based.\r\n  And let my breath of being blow to waste,\r\n  If I for thee unlearn my sacred duty!\r\n  The form, that long erewhile my fancy captured,\r\n  That from the magic mirror so enraptured,\r\n  Was but a frothy phantom of such beauty!\r\n  'Tis Thou, to whom the stir of all my forces,\r\n  The essence of my passion's courses,—\r\n  Love, fancy, worship, madness,—here I render.[212]\r\n\r\nIn the throes of this passion, Faust is tortured by jealousy when he\r\nsees the lovely woman clinging to and kissing a young man. He desires\r\nher at all costs.\r\n\r\n                  Am I nothing here? To stead me,\r\n  Is not this key still shining in my hand?\r\n  Through realms of terror, wastes and waves it led me,\r\n  Through solitudes, to where I firmly stand,\r\n  Here foothold is! Realities here centre!\r\n  The strife with spirits here the mind may venture,\r\n  And on its grand, its double lordship enter!\r\n  How far she was, and nearer, how divine!\r\n  I’ll rescue her and make her doubly mine.\r\n  Ye Mothers! Mothers! Crown this wild endeavour!\r\n  Who knows her once must hold her, and for ever.[213]\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the beautiful woman so moved Faust that he fainted\r\nand fell into a prolonged sleep. As soon as he recovered consciousness\r\nhe asked: “Where is she?” and set out to seek for her. When he learned\r\nthat Chiron had already carried off Helena on his back Faust cried\r\nout:—\r\n\r\n  Her didst thou bear?\r\n\r\n  _Chiron_: This back she pressed.\r\n\r\n  _Faust_: Was I not wild enough, before;\r\n  And now such seat, to make me blest!\r\n  O, I scarcely dare\r\n  To trust my senses!—tell me more!\r\n  She is my only Aspiration!\r\n  Whence didst thou bear her—to what shore?[214]\r\n\r\n  Thou saw’st her once; _to-day_ I saw her beam,\r\n  The dream of Beauty, beautiful as Dream!\r\n  My soul, my being, now is bound and chained;\r\n  I cannot live, unless she be attained.[215]\r\n\r\nChiron found this attitude of passionate emotion so strange that he\r\nadvised Faust to take care of his health.\r\n\r\nAfter many wanderings and difficulties Faust again met the woman he\r\ncoveted and spoke to her as follows:—\r\n\r\n  What else remains, but that I give to thee\r\n  Myself, and all I vainly fancied mine?\r\n  Let me, before thy feet, in fealty true,\r\n  Thee now acknowledge, Lady, whose approach\r\n  Won thee at once possession and the throne![216]\r\n\r\nThis language, so very different from what the same man had formerly\r\naddressed to Marguerite, is much more like that of an old lover to a\r\nyoung beauty whom he admires. When Helena invited Faust to sit on the\r\nthrone beside her, he replied:—\r\n\r\n  First, kneeling, let the dedication be\r\n  Accepted, lofty Lady! Let me kiss\r\n  The gracious hand that lifts me to thy side.\r\n  Confirm me as co-regent of thy realm,\r\n  Whose borders are unknown, and win for thee\r\n  Guard, slave and worshipper, and all in one![217]\r\n\r\nThe old man in the throes of a passion so great that he was wholly\r\nabsorbed by it did not dare to address the beloved woman except in the\r\nmost humble terms.\r\n\r\nHelena made no declaration of love, but was complacent to him, and when\r\nFaust suggested: “Now let our throne become a bower unblighted,” Helena\r\nagreed to follow him to a secluded and green bower. There they remained\r\nalone for some time, cared for by an old servant.\r\n\r\nThe result of this union was not a child like that to which Marguerite\r\ngave birth and afterwards killed. It was a strange and peculiar being;\r\na boy who immediately after his birth began to leap about and to alarm\r\nhis parents by the activity of his movements.\r\n\r\nAlthough Goethe preserved an obstinate silence when he was asked to\r\nexplain many of the scenes in the second Part, he had no hesitation in\r\nexplaining the significance of this astonishing child. “The child was\r\nnot a human being but an allegory, in which was personified poetry,\r\nwhich is not bound to any time, to any place, or to any person”\r\n(Eckermann, December 20, 1829). Struck by the tragic fate of Byron,\r\nGoethe made the son of Faust and Helena a symbol of the English poet.\r\n\r\nLiterary critics, setting out from the categorical explanation of\r\nGoethe himself, have declared that the union of Faust and Helena\r\nwas meant to denote the alliance of romanticism and classicism, a\r\nmarriage from which was born modern poetry, personified in its highest\r\nrepresentative, Byron. This, however, cannot be the idea of Goethe, who\r\nhimself was far from an enthusiast about classicism and romanticism.\r\n“What,” he said, “is all this noise about the classic and the romantic?\r\nThe essential thing is that a piece of work should be wholly good and\r\nserious; then it will also be classic” (Eckermann, October 17, 1828).\r\nIt is much more probable that Goethe intended poetry to spring from the\r\nrelations between the old Faust and his adorable companion, relations\r\nof a kind to be included in so-called platonic love. Such love inspires\r\nthe creation of perfect work even in an old poet, when he is stimulated\r\nby a beautiful woman.\r\n\r\nWhen Faust and Helena emerged from the grotto with their son, Helena\r\nsaid:—\r\n\r\n  _Helena_: Love, in human wise to bless us,\r\n  In a noble pair must be;\r\n\r\n  But divinely to possess us,\r\n  It must form a precious Three.\r\n\r\n  _Faust_: All we seek has therefore found us;\r\n  I am thine and thou art mine!\r\n  So we stand as love hath bound us;\r\n  Other fortune we resign.[218]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of her son, Helena abandoned Faust, leaving him her\r\ngarments:—\r\n\r\n  _Helena_: Also in me, alas! an old word proves its truth,\r\n  That Bliss and Beauty ne’er enduringly unite.\r\n  Torn is the link of Life, no less than that of Love;\r\n  So, both lamenting, painfully I say: Farewell!\r\n  And cast myself again,—once only,—in thine arms.[219]\r\n\r\nAfter this crisis the old Faust sought to console himself in the bosom\r\nof nature, just as after the terrible catastrophe with Marguerite the\r\ncontemplation of nature had given him the strength to live. On this\r\noccasion he reached the summit of a high mountain from which he watched\r\nthe changing vapours of a cloud which seemed to him to assume the form\r\nof female beauty. But Faust was old, and now saw only memories of love.\r\nHe cried out:—\r\n\r\n                            Yes! mine eyes not err!—\r\n  On sun-illumined pillows beauteously reclined,\r\n  Colossal, truly, but a godlike woman-form,\r\n  I see! The like of Juno, Leda, Helena,\r\n  Majestically lovely, floats before my sight!\r\n  Ah! now ’tis broken! Towering broad and formlessly,\r\n  It rests along the east like distant icy hills,\r\n  And shapes the grand significance of fleeting days.\r\n  Yet still there clings a light and delicate band of mist\r\n  Around my breast and brow, caressing, cheering me.\r\n  Now light, delaying, it soars and higher soars,\r\n  And folds together.—Cheats me an ecstatic form,\r\n  As early-youthful, long-foregone and highest bliss?\r\n  The first glad treasures of my deepest heart break forth;\r\n  Aurora’s love, so light of pinion, is its type,\r\n  The swiftly-felt, the first, scarce-comprehended glance,\r\n  Outshining every treasure, when retained and held.\r\n\r\n  Like Spiritual Beauty mounts the gracious Form,\r\n  Dissolving not, but lifts itself through ether far,\r\n  And from my inner being bears the best away.[220]\r\n\r\nThis state of mind resembles Goethe’s condition after the rupture with\r\nUlrique.\r\n\r\nLove and poetry alike were over for him. None the less his craving for\r\nthe higher life was not yet weakened. The desire to live was still\r\nvery strong in the old Faust. But now he no longer as in the days\r\nof his youth dreamed of an ideal which could not be attained. When\r\nMephistopheles asked him ironically:—\r\n\r\n  Then might one guess whereunto thou hast striven?\r\n  Boldly-sublime it was, I’m sure.\r\n  Since nearer to the moon thy flight was driven,\r\n  Would now thy mania that realm secure?\r\n\r\n  _Faust_: Not so! This sphere of earthly soil\r\n  Still gives us room for lofty doing.\r\n  Astounding plans e’en now are brewing:\r\n  I feel new strength for bolder toil.[221]\r\n\r\nSuch optimistic language, extraordinarily different from Faust’s\r\nlamentations in the first Part, becomes still more marked. When he was\r\napproaching his centenary he made the following profession of faith:—\r\n\r\n  I only through the world have flown:\r\n  Each appetite I seized as by the hair;\r\n  What not sufficed me, forth I let it fare,\r\n  And what escaped me, I let go.\r\n  I’ve only craved, accomplished my delight,\r\n  Then wished a second time, and thus with might\r\n  Stormed through my life: at first ’twas grand, completely,\r\n  But now it moves most wisely and discreetly.\r\n  The sphere of Earth is known enough to me;\r\n  The view beyond is barred immutably:\r\n  A fool, who there his blinking eyes directeth,\r\n  And o’er his clouds of peers a place expecteth!\r\n  Firm let him stand, and look around him well!\r\n  This World means something to the Capable.\r\n  Why needs he through Eternity to wend?\r\n  He here acquires what he can apprehend.[222]\r\n\r\nWhen he had reached the maturity of his wisdom, Faust organised\r\ndrainage works, the object of which was to increase the area of land\r\nthat could be utilised:—\r\n\r\n  To many millions let me furnish soil,\r\n  Though not secure, yet free to active toil;\r\n  Green, fertile fields.\r\n  A land like Paradise here, round about.\r\n  Yes! to this thought I hold with firm persistence;\r\n  The last result of wisdom stamps it true:\r\n  He only earns his freedom and existence,\r\n  Who daily conquers them anew.\r\n  Thus here, by dangers girt, shall glide away\r\n  Of childhood, manhood, age, the vigorous day:\r\n  And such a throng I fain would see,\r\n  Stand on free soil among a people free!\r\n  Then dared I hail the Moment fleeing:\r\n  “_Ah, still delay—thou art so fair!_”\r\n  The traces cannot, of mine earthly being,\r\n  In æons perish,—they are there!—\r\n  In proud fore-feeling of such lofty bliss,\r\n  I now enjoy the highest Moment,—this![223]\r\n\r\nThese were the last words of the wise centenarian. It has been said\r\nthat they contain the quintessence of Goethe’s moral philosophy, and\r\nthat they preach the sacrifice of the individual for the benefit of\r\nsociety. Lewes, for instance, takes this view, holding that Faust was\r\nthe exposition of a man who had conquered the vanity of individual\r\naspirations and joys, and had come to the knowledge of the great truth\r\nthat man must live for man, and can find lasting happiness only in\r\nwork for the benefit of humanity. For my own part, it seems to me that\r\naccording to Goethe’s _Faust_ man must dedicate a large part of his\r\nlife to the complete development of his own individuality, and that\r\nit is only in the second half of his life, when he has grown wise by\r\nexperience and feels satisfied as an individual, that he should use\r\nhis activity for the good of mankind. It was no part either of the\r\nideas of Goethe or of the nature of his work to preach the sacrifice of\r\nindividuality.\r\n\r\nGoethe was thus absorbed in _Faust_ by the problem of the conflict\r\nbetween certain actions and guiding principles. The misdeeds of the\r\nhero in the first Part of his life had to be redeemed. He said to\r\nEckermann that “the key to the salvation of Faust was to be found in\r\nthe Angels’ Chorus”:—\r\n\r\n  The noble spirit now is free,\r\n  And saved from evil scheming:\r\n  Whoe’er aspires unweariedly\r\n  Is not beyond redeeming.[224]\r\n\r\nHowever, that of which he did not speak, and which none the less was\r\nmost important in Faust and in Goethe himself, is the action of love as\r\na stimulant to artistic creation, and it was probably to this that he\r\nreferred at the end of his tragedy. The mystical chorus sent up prayers\r\nin a religious and erotic ecstasy, and their mysterious song is:—\r\n\r\n  The Indescribable,\r\n  Here it is done;\r\n  The Woman-Soul leadeth us\r\n  Upward and on![225]\r\n\r\nAlthough these verses have been interpreted as love which sacrifices or\r\neven love which leads to the grace of God (Bode, p. 149), it is much\r\nmore probable that it is love for feminine beauty, a love which makes\r\npossible the execution of wonderful things. Such an interpretation\r\nagrees with the fact that the verses are spoken by a _mystic_ choir\r\nwhich speaks of the _indescribable_ (_das Unbeschreibliche_) in\r\nwhich we must see the amorous passion of the old man. In such an\r\ninterpretation the whole of _Faust_ (and especially the second Part) is\r\nan eloquent pleading for the importance of love in the higher activity\r\nof man, in accordance with the law of human nature, which is a much\r\nbetter justification of Goethe’s conduct than all the arguments of his\r\ninterpreters and admirers.\r\n\r\nI do not agree with the common idea that the two Parts of _Faust_ are\r\ntwo distinct works, but regard them as complementary. In the first Part\r\nwe see the young pessimist, full of ardour and of desires, ready to\r\nmake an end of his days and stopping at nothing to satisfy his thirst\r\nfor love. In the second Part we have a mature old man still loving\r\nwomen, but in a different way, a man who is wise and optimistic, and\r\nwho, having satiated the wants of his individual life, dedicates the\r\nrest of his days to mankind, and who, having reached a century, dies\r\nextremely happy, in fact almost exhibiting the instinct of natural\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IX\r\n\r\nSCIENCE AND MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nUTILITARIAN AND INTUITIVE MORALITY\r\n\r\n  Difficulty of the problem of morality—Vivisection\r\n  and anti-vivisection—Enquiry into the possibility of\r\n  rational morality—Utilitarian and intuitive theories of\r\n  morality—Insufficiency of these\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the course of this book I have from time to time approached\r\nsubjects closely related with the problem of morality. For instance,\r\nin considering the prolongation of human life, it was necessary to\r\nshow that extension of longevity far beyond the reproductive period of\r\nman in no way is opposed to the principles of the highest morality,\r\nalthough there exist races who find the sacrifice of old people in\r\nharmony with their conception of morality.\r\n\r\nExperimental biology, which lies at the root of most of the doctrines\r\nexposed in this work, depends on vivisection of animals. There are,\r\nhowever, very many persons who regard it as immoral to operate on\r\nliving animals when it is not for the direct benefit of these. The\r\nattempts which have been made in France and Germany to prevent or to\r\nlimit vivisection in laboratories have not succeeded, but in England\r\nthere is a severe law controlling operations on animals and submitting\r\nthem to oppressive regulations to which many of the scientific men in\r\nthe country are opposed.\r\n\r\nThe question of experiments upon human beings is still more delicate.\r\nJust as formerly the examination of a human corpse could be made only\r\nin secret, so at the present time, if the slightest experiment is to be\r\nmade upon a human being, it can be only by devious ways. People who are\r\nhardly shocked at all at the numberless accidents caused by automobiles\r\nand other means of transit, or in field sports, make the strongest\r\nprotest against any proposal to try some new method of treatment upon a\r\nhuman being.\r\n\r\nA large number of people, amongst them even men of science, regard\r\nas immoral any attempt to prevent the spread of venereal diseases.\r\nRecently, in connection with the investigations into the action of\r\nmercurial ointment as a means of preventing syphilis, the members of\r\nthe Faculty of Medicine in France made a public protest, declaring\r\nthat it would be “immoral to let people think that they could indulge\r\nin sexual vice without danger,” and that it was “wrong to give to the\r\npublic a means of protection in debauch.”[226] None the less, other men\r\nof science, equally serious, were convinced that they were performing\r\nan absolutely moral work in attempting to find a prophylactic against\r\nsyphilis which would preserve many people, including children and other\r\ninnocent persons who, if no preventive measures existed, would suffer\r\nfrom the terrible disease.\r\n\r\nSuch examples show the reader what confusion exists in the problem of\r\nmorality. Although at every moment, in every act of human conduct, the\r\nprecepts of morality must be reckoned with, even the most authoritative\r\npersons are far from agreeing as to what rules to follow. About a\r\nyear ago in a Parisian journal[227] an enquiry into the subject of\r\nrational morality was directed to distinguished authors. The object\r\nwas to discover if, at the present time, moral conduct could be based\r\nnot on religious dogma, which binds only those who believe in it, but\r\non rational principles. The answers were most contradictory. Some\r\ndenied the possibility of rational morality, others admitted it, but\r\nin very different fashions. Whilst one philosopher, M. Boutroux,\r\nheld that “morality must be founded on reason and could have no\r\nother foundation,” a poet, M. Sully-Prudhomme, turned to feeling and\r\nconscience as the basis of morality. According to him, “in the teaching\r\nof morality, it is the heart and not the mind which is at once master\r\nand pupil.” In the contradictions which I mentioned in the beginning\r\nof this chapter, these two views appear. When antivivisectionists\r\nare protesting against experiments on animals, they are inspired by\r\nsympathy for poor creatures which cannot defend themselves. Guided by\r\nconscience, they think immoral any suffering inflicted upon a living\r\nbeing for the benefit of another being, whether human or animal. I\r\nknow distinguished physiologists who have determined to limit their\r\nexperiments to animals with little sensibility, such as frogs. The\r\ngreat majority of scientific men, however, would have no scruple in\r\nopening bodies and subjecting their victims to severe suffering in the\r\nhope of clearing up some scientific problem which sooner or later would\r\nincrease the happiness of human beings and animals. If vivisection\r\nhad not been performed, or if it had been restricted, the great laws\r\nof infectious diseases would not have been discovered, nor would\r\nthe discovery of many valuable remedies have been made. To justify\r\ninvestigation, men of science set out from the utilitarian theory of\r\nmorality, which approves everything that is useful to the human race.\r\nThe antivivisectionists, on the other hand, rely on the intuitive\r\ntheory, according to which conduct is controlled by the spontaneous\r\nactivity of our conscience.\r\n\r\nIn the case which I have selected the problem is easy to solve. It is\r\nplain that vivisection is inevitable in the experimental investigation\r\nof vital processes, as it is the only means by which serious progress\r\ncan be made. None the less, very many people cannot accept this\r\nnecessity, because of the intensity of their love for animals.\r\n\r\nIn the question of the prevention of syphilis, the moral problem is\r\nstill more easy to settle. Whilst in the case of vivisection a real\r\nsuffering may be inflicted upon animals, in preventive measures against\r\nsyphilis, the evil is more or less intricate and very problematic.\r\nThe certainty of safety from this disease might render extra-conjugal\r\nrelations more frequent, but if we compare the evil which might come\r\nfrom that with the immense benefit gained in preventing so many\r\ninnocent persons from becoming diseased, it is easy to see to which\r\nside the scale dips. The indignation of those who protest against the\r\ndiscovery of preventive measures can never either arrest the zeal of\r\nthe investigators or hinder the use of the measures. This example\r\nagain shows that reasoning is necessary in the solution of most moral\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the problems which arise in actual life are often very much\r\nmore complicated than the two cases I have taken as an introduction.\r\nIt is easy to prove the high utility of the work of vivisectors and\r\nof those who are seeking means of preventing syphilis, whilst their\r\nadversaries have nothing to invoke but their feelings. The situation is\r\nquite different in many questions which border on morality. The sexual\r\nlife abounds in extremely difficult problems, in which it is almost\r\nimpossible to determine what is right. Let me recall the vagaries\r\nin the life of Goethe, whose great genius was so often in conflict\r\nwith the morality of his time. Was he wrong in giving up Frederique\r\nand Lili from the fear that a permanent bond would damage his poetic\r\nproductivity? Then there is the moral question of the marriage of\r\nmen affected with syphilis, or other diseases which might influence\r\nthe offspring. The problems of the continence of young people before\r\nmarriage, of prostitution and of means of preventing conception are\r\nwithout doubt questions of great importance, the solution of which is\r\nextremely difficult from the point of view of morality. Differences of\r\nopinion are revealed in nearly everything relating to punishment. The\r\nquestion of the death penalty is much in dispute and requires numerous\r\ninvestigations of different kinds. Statistics have been collected to\r\ngive information as to the utility or inutility of the death penalty.\r\nAccording to some results, capital punishment does not diminish the\r\nnumber of crimes, whilst according to others it has a real preventive\r\neffect. Punishments less violent than death, and particularly the\r\npunishments of children, are equally troublesome, and schoolmasters\r\nhave difficulty in finding a solution.\r\n\r\nThe utilitarian theory of morality often finds it impossible to prove\r\nthe advantage of the conduct it prescribes, and this the more because\r\nin many cases we do not exactly know who is to profit by it. Is the\r\nutility of any particular act to be considered so far as it affects\r\nrelatives, members of the same religion, of the same country, or of the\r\nsame race, or all humanity?\r\n\r\nIn face of these difficulties, many moral philosophers have given up\r\nthe utilitarian theory and declared for an intuitive theory. The basis\r\nof morality is to be found in a feeling innate in every man, a sort of\r\nsocial instinct urging him to do good to his neighbour, and which, by\r\nthe voice of his own conscience, dictates how he ought to act much more\r\nprecisely than could be done by any comprehension of the utility of his\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that man is an animal living in society because\r\nof his need for association with other human beings. But whilst in\r\nthe animal world the members of societies are actuated by an instinct\r\nwhich is blind and generally very precise, in man we find nothing of\r\nthe kind. The social instinct appears in him in endless variety. In\r\nsome of us love of neighbours is extremely highly developed, so that\r\nsome persons are only happy when sacrificing themselves for the public\r\ngood. They give all that they have to the poor, and often die for some\r\nideal which is necessarily altruistic. Such examples are rare. Many\r\nmen, however, profess an affection for some of their kind, devote\r\nthemselves to their relations, their friends, or their compatriots,\r\nand remain practically indifferent to all others. Other individuals,\r\nagain, have an even narrower sphere of affection, and take advantage\r\nof their fellows, either in their own interest or in that of their own\r\nfamily. Still more rare are the really wicked persons who have no love\r\nfor anyone but themselves and who take pleasure in doing harm to those\r\nabout them. Notwithstanding this diversity in the development of the\r\nsocial instinct, all men have to live together.\r\n\r\nIf it were possible to know the inner motives of men, these might be\r\nused as a basis for classifying conduct. Those acts might be described\r\nas moral which were inspired by neighbourly love, and those as immoral\r\nthe motive of which was egoism. But it is seldom that the real motives\r\nare discovered; they lie deep down in the individual mind, sometimes\r\nunknown even to the man himself. We can nearly always harmonise our\r\nacts with the dictates of our consciences and find reasons for the\r\nharm we inflict upon others. It is only rare natures that possess a\r\nconscience so delicate as to be always tormented lest they are not\r\ndoing good to their neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn the course of life, men are disposed to attribute bad motives to\r\ntheir opponents. Such an attitude makes criticism easier and panders\r\nto the common wish to speak evil of one’s neighbours. Notwithstanding\r\nthe numerous precedents for such an attitude amongst politicians and\r\njournalists, it must be discarded from any serious study of morality.\r\n\r\nThe motives and the conscience are elusive elements of little use\r\nin any attempt to value human conduct. We have to fall back on the\r\nconsequences of action. Now it is easy to show that the social instinct\r\noften leads to action which is not good. It frequently happens that\r\nmen, acting with the highest and best intentions, do much harm.\r\nSchopenhauer long ago pointed out that morality based on sentiment is a\r\nmere caricature of real morality. Impelled by the altruistic wish to do\r\ngood, men often lavish unreflecting charity and do harm to others and\r\nto themselves. In _Timon of Athens_ Shakespeare depicted\r\n\r\n  A most incomparable man; breathed, as it were,\r\n  To an untirable and continuate goodness,\r\n\r\nand who gave away to the right and the left, creating around him a\r\ncloud of parasites. He finally ruined himself and became a hopeless\r\nmisanthrope. Shakespeare put his verdict in the mouth of Flavius:—\r\n\r\n  Undone by goodness. Strange, unusual blood,\r\n  When man’s worst sin is, he does too much good.\r\n\r\nMorality, founded purely on sentiment, has inspired the attacks on\r\nvivisectors which in all confidence spread evil amongst men.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising result of the great complexity of human affairs,\r\nthat society is sometimes better served by wicked acts than by acts\r\ninspired by the most generous feelings. Thus extremely rigorous\r\nmeasures of repression are often more successful than the half-measures\r\nemployed by humane and charitable administrators.\r\n\r\nThe intuitive theory of morality has had no greater success than\r\nutilitarianism. Even if the sentiment of society were a true basis of\r\nmoral conduct, it fails in actual practice. On the other hand, although\r\nutility is the object of all morality, it is in most cases so difficult\r\nto determine what is really useful, that utilitarianism breaks down as\r\nthe foundation of morality.\r\n\r\nWe must look elsewhere for principles which can guide us towards right\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMORALITY AND HUMAN NATURE\r\n\r\n  Attempts to found morality on the laws of human\r\n  nature—Kant’s theory of moral obligation—Some\r\n  criticisms of the Kantian theory—Moral conduct must be\r\n  guided by reason\r\n\r\n\r\nEven in antiquity, there were efforts to find a basis for morality\r\nother than the precepts of religion based on revelation, but the\r\nfailure of such attempts has long been admitted. In the first chapter\r\nof _The Nature of Man_, I described such efforts to find a basis\r\nfor morality in human nature itself. The Epicureans and the Stoics,\r\nalthough their doctrines were opposed, each claimed to set out from\r\nhuman nature. The principle is too vague for practical use, as human\r\nnature can be interpreted in very different fashions.\r\n\r\nWhen several attempts to find a rational basis for morality had failed,\r\nKant’s theory appeared and was hailed by many as a real advance. None\r\nthe less, it has not met with general approval and may be taken as a\r\nsupreme instance of the failure to solve the great problem of morality\r\nby reason. I do not wish to deal with it at length, but a review of its\r\nmain outlines is pertinent to my argument.\r\n\r\nAccording to Kant, morality cannot be founded on the feeling of\r\nsympathy, nor can it have as its object the happiness of men. Nature\r\nwould have been an unskilful workman were her object the happiness of\r\nhuman beings, for many lower animals have much more happiness. An inner\r\nlaw is the force compelling us to morality, and without that we should\r\nhave to seek our guide in happiness.\r\n\r\nKant’s doctrine is an intuitive theory of morality. It is based neither\r\non sympathy nor on any inherent charity, which would make us covet\r\nhappiness for our fellows, but solely on the consciousness of duty.\r\nKant thought that the action of a man who wished to do good to his\r\nfellows was devoid of merit. Conduct was moral only in so far as it was\r\nobedience to the inner sense of duty. Schiller’s epigram has thrown\r\ninto relief this part of the great philosopher’s theory, “When I take\r\npleasure in doing good to my neighbour, I am uneasy, as I fear that I\r\nhave been lacking in virtue.”\r\n\r\nIn his criticism of Kant’s system, Herbert Spencer drew a picture of\r\na world inhabited by men who had no sympathy for their fellows and\r\nwho did good to them against their natural instincts and only from\r\na pure sense of duty. Spencer thought that such a world would be\r\nuninhabitable. Clearly, moral conduct, on the Kantian basis, could\r\nbe followed only by exceptional persons, for most men follow their\r\ninclinations rather than any sense of duty. People of lower culture\r\nwould accept kindnesses from others without caring whether the motive\r\nwere kindness or a sense of duty, but highly civilised people would not\r\nendure service from those whom they knew to be acting against their\r\ninstincts in obedience to a sense of duty. And so men would be driven\r\nto hide the real motives of their conduct, lest they should offend the\r\nsensibility of those towards whom their moral conduct was directed.\r\nSuch cases, where the real motive is concealed, show how impossible\r\nit is to judge of conduct from the motives which may be supposed to\r\nhave inspired it. As it is generally impossible to know whether some\r\naltruistic conduct has been inspired by kindness or has been performed\r\nas a duty, it is better to give up any attempt to appraise the springs\r\nof moral conduct.\r\n\r\nKant himself realised the need of some other standard for appraising\r\nhuman conduct. With such a purpose he arrived at his well-known\r\nmaxim:—“Let your conduct be such that your motive might serve as a\r\nstandard of universal application.” To explain the maxim he gave a\r\nnumber of examples. A man who is without money and cannot pay a debt\r\nis in doubt as to whether he should promise to repay his creditor.\r\nAccording to Kant, he ought to ask himself what would be the result\r\nif such a promise were to be made under similar circumstances by\r\neveryone. It is plain that if such false promises became universal,\r\nthey would cease to be believed and so would be impracticable in\r\nactual life. Kant’s formula, therefore, would supply a rational basis\r\nfor the discrimination of immoral conduct. In the case of theft it\r\nwould operate as follows: if it became the custom for everyone to take\r\nwhatever he wanted, private property and theft would simultaneously\r\ncease to exist. So also suicide is immoral, since if it became general\r\nthe human race would cease to exist.\r\n\r\nKant, however, was looking at only one side of the problem. Moral\r\nconduct is frequently limited to an individual, and cannot be\r\ngeneralised for all humanity. Thus, for instance, if one about to\r\nsacrifice his life for the good of his fellows were to estimate his\r\naction according to Kant’s formula, he would reach a conclusion similar\r\nto that in the case of suicide; if everyone were to sacrifice his life\r\nfor others, no one would remain alive, and so, according to Kant, the\r\nsacrifice of one’s life for the good of others would be an immoral act.\r\n\r\nIt is plain that in his search for a rational basis of morality, Kant\r\nfound only a hollow form, void of any substantial body of morality.\r\nIt is not enough that a moral man should take his consciousness of\r\nduty as a guide. He must know what would be the result of his acts.\r\nIf it is immoral to make a false promise, it is because people would\r\nlose confidence in such promises, and confidence is necessary to our\r\nwell-being. When the formula of Kant condemns theft, it is because, if\r\ntheft became general, there could be no private property, and property\r\nis regarded as necessary to the well-being of men. Suicide is immoral,\r\naccording to Kant, because it would lead to the disappearance of the\r\nhuman race, and human life is of course a good.\r\n\r\nKant tried to found his theory of morality on a rational basis which\r\nexcluded the idea of the general good, but it was impossible for him to\r\navoid it. His “practical reason,” when it raised the consciousness of\r\nduty to a principle, should have pointed the goal towards which moral\r\nacts were to be directed. In this matter, I find that Kant’s ideas are\r\nvery vague, although extremely interesting.\r\n\r\nThe innate feeling of duty implies the _will_ to pursue moral conduct.\r\nThis will is independent of the circum-ambient conditions. Kant in his\r\nnebulous language explains this consideration as follows:—“Our reason\r\ninforms us of a law to which all our maxims are subject, as if our will\r\nhad created its own natural order of things. This law, then, is in\r\nthe sphere of a nature which we do not know empirically but which the\r\nfreedom of the will makes possible, a nature which is supra-sensible,\r\nbut which from the practical point of view we make objective, because\r\nit is created by our will in virtue of our existence as rational\r\nbeings. The difference between the laws of a nature to which the will\r\nis subject and a nature subject to the will subsists in this, that\r\nin the first the objects must be the causes which determine the will,\r\nwhilst in the second, the will itself causes the objects so that the\r\ncausality of the will resides exclusively in pure reason, pure reason\r\nbeing thus practical reason” (_Critique of Practical Reason_).\r\n\r\nSo far as I can follow the argument of Kant, it seems to me to imply\r\nthat rational morality cannot be bound by human nature as it exists. I\r\nmay perhaps interpret Kant’s thought as if he had the intuition that\r\nthe moral will was capable of modifying nature by subjecting it to its\r\nown laws.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, several critics of Kant have attempted to improve\r\nhis theory of morality by reconciling it with human nature as it\r\nactually exists. Vacherot,[228] for instance, has taken such an\r\nattitude in the most definite fashion. He insists that Kant “did not\r\nappreciate the capital importance of the object of the moral law. The\r\nproblem which under the designation _summum bonum_ absorbed the schools\r\nof antiquity plays a minor part in the Kantian theory. Kant should have\r\nrecognised that human destiny is not limited to duty but must include\r\nhappiness” (p. 316).\r\n\r\nBut what is this “happiness” which is to be the standard of human\r\nactions? To answer this Vacherot places himself in the position of\r\nthose ancient philosophers whom I discussed in _The Nature of Man_. He\r\nmakes his point absolutely clear. “What is the ‘good’ for any being?\r\nThe attaining of its purpose. What is the purpose of a being? The\r\nsimple development of its nature. Apply this to man and morality. When\r\nhuman nature is known by observation and analysis, the deduction can be\r\nmade as to what is the purpose, and the good, and therefore the law of\r\nman. For the conception of the good necessarily involves the idea of\r\nduty and of law to be imposed on the will. We have to fall back, then,\r\non knowledge of man, but it must be complete knowledge, a recognition\r\nof the faculties, feelings, and inclinations that are peculiar to him\r\nand that distinguish him from animals” (p. 319). Here is a summary\r\nof this doctrine:—“Develop all our natural powers, subordinating\r\nthose which are subsidiary to those which form the peculiar quality\r\nof human beings; this is the true economy of the little world we call\r\nhuman life; this is its purpose and this its law. The formula states\r\nin the most scientific and least doubtful form a very old truth, the\r\nfoundation of all morality and the test of all its applications. If we\r\nseek to know what are justice, duty and virtue, we must look in the\r\nworld itself, and not above or below it” (Op. 301).\r\n\r\nProfessor Paulsen, a more recent critic of Kant, comes to a similar\r\nconclusion.[229] He thinks that Kant should have modified his formula\r\nin some such way as follows:—“The laws of morality are rules which\r\nmight serve for a natural legislation for human life; in other words,\r\nrules that, when they guided conduct according to natural law, would\r\nresult in the preservation and supreme development of human life.”\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side we examine the problem of morality, we come to\r\nsubmit conduct to the laws of human nature. Sutherland, a modern author\r\nwho discusses morality by the scientific method, defines morality\r\nas “conduct guided by rational sympathy.” Such sympathy would not\r\nsubordinate the chief good of others to an advantage less important but\r\nmore immediate. Thus a mother may sympathise with her child when it has\r\nto take some unpleasant medicine; but if her sympathy be rational she\r\nwill not let it interfere with the health of the child.\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing case, sympathy has to be controlled by medical\r\nknowledge. In moral conduct generally, reason must be the determining\r\nfactor, whatever be the inspiring motive of the conduct, whether it\r\ncome from sympathy or from the sense of duty. And thus morality in the\r\nlast resort must be based on scientific knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nINDIVIDUALISM\r\n\r\n  Individual morality—History of two brothers brought\r\n  up in same circumstances, but whose conduct was\r\n  quite different—Late development of the sense of\r\n  life—Evolution of sympathy—The sphere of egoism in\r\n  moral conduct—Christian morality—Morality of Herbert\r\n  Spencer—Danger of exalted altruism\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough moral conduct refers specially to the relations between men,\r\nthere exists a morality of the individual. As this latter is simpler, I\r\nshall consider it first in my investigation of rational morality.\r\n\r\nWhen a man, seeking his individual happiness, gives way to his\r\ninclinations without restraint, he often comes to behave in a way that\r\nis generally regarded as immoral. Following his inclination, he may\r\nbecome idle and drunken. Idleness may depend on some irregularity of\r\nthe brain, and may thus be as natural as is the wish to take drink\r\nin the case of a man to whom alcohol brings a feeling of well-being\r\nand gaiety. Why is it that idleness and alcoholism are immoral? Is\r\nit because they prevent the living of life in its completest and\r\nwidest sense, according to the theory of Herbert Spencer? But it is\r\nprecisely in this way that the adherents of the theory justify all\r\nkinds of excess without which fullness and width of life seem to them\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nWhilst vices such as idleness and drunkenness arise directly from\r\nqualities of the human constitution, they must be regarded as immoral\r\nbecause they prevent the completion of the ideal cycle of human\r\nlife. I knew two brothers, almost the same age, subject to the same\r\ninfluences, and brought up in the same environment. None the less,\r\ntheir tastes and conduct were very different. The older brother,\r\nalthough very intelligent, during his college career devoted himself\r\neagerly to bodily exercises and indulged in every way his inclination\r\nfor pleasure. “As the chief end of life is happiness,” he said, “one\r\nmust try to get as much of it as possible,” and so he got into the\r\nhabit of visiting places where there was most amusement. Cards, good\r\nliving, and women furnished for him the means of pleasure. As his\r\nability was unusual, he passed his examinations almost without having\r\nworked. The example of his younger brother, always a devoted student,\r\ndid not attract him. “It is all very well for you,” he said, “as you\r\nfind your happiness in work; as for me, I detest books, and I am happy\r\nonly when I am giving myself up to pleasure. Everyone must take his\r\nown road to the goal of life.” As a result, the health of the older\r\nbrother was seriously affected by his mode of life. He acquired some\r\ndisease of the circulatory system, had to face the end, and died at\r\nthe age of fifty-six. The last years of his life were very unhappy,\r\nas the instinct of life developed in him extremely strongly. He was a\r\nvictim of his own ignorance because when he was young he did not know\r\nthat the sense of life would develop later on, and would become much\r\nstronger than in his youth. His brother was equally unaware of this\r\nfact, but, absorbed in scientific study, he kept himself apart from the\r\nindulgences of youth and lived a sober life. In this way he found that\r\nhis strength and activity were fully preserved at a time of life when\r\nhis older brother was already a physical wreck.\r\n\r\nI have quoted this example, not to repeat the banal idea that a sober\r\nlife is followed by a healthier old age than an intemperate life, but\r\nbecause I wish to insist on the importance of the development of the\r\ninstinct of life in the course of each individual life. I see that\r\nthis idea is very little known. I was present at the last moments of\r\nmy older brother (he was called Ivan Ilyitch, and he was the subject\r\nof the famous story of Tolstoi: _The Death of Ivan Ilyitch_). Knowing\r\nthat he was going to die from pyemia, at the age of forty-five, my\r\nbrother preserved his great intelligence in all its clearness. As I\r\nsat by his bedside he told me his reflections in the most objective\r\nfashion possible. The idea of his death was for long very terrible to\r\nhim, but “as we all die” he came to “resign himself, saying that after\r\nall there was only a quantitative difference between death at the age\r\nof forty-five and later on.” This reflection, which relieved the moral\r\nsufferings of my brother, is none the less untrue. The sense of life is\r\nvery different at different ages, and a man who lives beyond the age of\r\nforty-five experiences many sensations which he did not know before.\r\nThere is a great evolution of the mind during the advance of age.\r\n\r\nEven if we do not accept the existence of an instinct of natural\r\ndeath as the crown of normal life, we cannot deny that youth is only\r\na preparatory stage and that the mind does not acquire its final\r\ndevelopment until later on. This conception should be the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the science of life and the guide for education and\r\npractical philosophy.\r\n\r\nIndividual morality consists of conduct permitting the accomplishment\r\nof the normal cycle of life and ending in a feeling of satisfaction as\r\ncomplete as possible and which can be reached only in advanced age. And\r\nso, when we see a man wasting his health and strength and youth, and\r\nthus making himself incapable of feeling the most complete pleasure in\r\nlife, we call him immoral.\r\n\r\nA man entirely isolated does not exist in nature. We are born weak\r\nand incapable of satisfying our needs and at once come into relations\r\nwith the human being who feeds us and protects us. The child, although\r\negoistic, becomes attached to his protector, and in this way the\r\nfeeling of sympathy is born. Guided by this feeling as well as by the\r\nsense of his own interest, the child soon begins to employ his will\r\nin restraining some of his instincts, which, none the less, are quite\r\nnatural. Thus, the fear of being deprived of food makes him obedient\r\nto his protectors. The child cannot complete his normal cycle without\r\npursuing a certain moral conduct.\r\n\r\nWhen he becomes adult, man experiences the instinctive need of\r\nrelations with someone of the other sex. This need lays certain duties\r\non him, and although the love of a young man is less egoistical\r\nthan that of the child, it is far from presenting the characters of\r\nself-abnegation and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nA young woman, after having passed through the usual cycle of life\r\nwith her mother and with a man, becomes herself a mother. Maternal\r\ninstinct furnishes her with certain rules of conduct, but this natural\r\ninstinct is not enough to fulfil its object, that is to say, to rear\r\nthe child until an age when it can live independently. Directed by a\r\nfeeling of sympathy for her child, the young mother learns from women\r\nwith more experience to ward off dangers from her child. In the first\r\nyears, moral conduct on the part of the mother consists almost entirely\r\nin bringing up the child in a healthy way. For this purpose she must\r\nacquire much knowledge. If she remains ignorant, her conduct must be\r\nregarded as immoral.\r\n\r\nSo far as concerns the bringing up of a child, the moral problem is\r\nquite simple, because we are all agreed that the object is to rear\r\nthe child to maturity in the healthiest possible condition. When the\r\nchild exhibits any habits harmful to this object, although due to\r\nnatural instincts, the mother applies her knowledge to restrain them\r\nwithout paying attention to the theory that happiness consists in the\r\nfulfilment of everything that is natural. When a child has passed\r\nthrough the perilous first period of its life, the mother has to ask\r\nwhat general object she is to follow in its education. She wishes her\r\nchild to be as happy as possible. Here the conception of orthobiosis\r\nwill serve her, and it will teach her that the greatest happiness\r\nconsists in the normal evolution of the sense of life, leading to\r\nserene old age, and finally reaching the fulness of satiety of life.\r\nMan, who has passed his apprenticeship to life from his birth, with his\r\nprotectors, and, later on, with persons of the other sex, inevitably\r\nacquires certain elements necessary for social life. Persuaded that\r\nin order to succeed in his individual life he must have help from his\r\nfellows, he learns to subdue his anti-social tendencies, at first\r\nin his own interests. Let me take an example of this. When a man\r\nhas reached a certain stage of civilisation, it generally becomes\r\nimpossible to him to supply his bodily wants without the help of\r\npersons less cultured than himself. He takes into his house one or more\r\nservants, with whom he enters into definite relations. He wishes for\r\nhimself and those about him a normal life, such as I have described\r\nin _The Nature of Man_. To attain this it is indispensable in his own\r\ninterest and in that of his family, that his domestic servants should\r\nbe well treated. The health of the family very often depends on the\r\nconduct of the servants, who will follow conscientiously the hygienic\r\nrules only if they themselves are living in good conditions. The custom\r\naccording to which the masters live in luxuriously furnished rooms,\r\nwhile their servants have mean quarters in the attics, is immoral from\r\nthe point of view of the well-being of the masters themselves. The\r\ncrowded servants’ quarters are a nest of all sorts of infection, which\r\nmay spread in the families of the masters. Very often people who think\r\nthat they are following the rules of exact hygiene contract diseases\r\nwithout knowing that the infection has come from their servants.\r\n\r\nAnger gives us another example. It is certainly harmful to the health,\r\nand so should be controlled in the interest of the bad-tempered\r\nperson himself. Fits of rage are frequently followed by ruptures of\r\nblood-vessels, and by diabetes, and even cataracts have developed after\r\nsome violent passion.\r\n\r\nLuxurious habits are also well known to be harmful to the health. Heavy\r\nmeals, evenings passed in the theatre and in society may seriously\r\naffect activity of the organs. Moreover, the luxury of some people\r\nis often the cause of misery to others. The knowledge that luxurious\r\nhabits shorten life and prevent man from reaching the greatest\r\nhappiness may warn people against luxury better than the appeal to the\r\nfeeling of sympathy.\r\n\r\nAs it is a fact that most men guide their lives generally from egoistic\r\nmotives, any theory of morality which is to be put into practice must\r\nreckon seriously with this factor. All other systems have recognised\r\nit. In the Sermon on the Mount, which is a summary of Christian\r\nmorality, each moral act is recognised on the ground that it will\r\nbring some reward or obviate some punishment. “Rejoice,” said Jesus,\r\n“and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven” (Matt. v.,\r\n12). “Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of\r\nthem; otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven”\r\n(Matt. vi., 1). “That thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father\r\nwhich seeth in secret himself shall reward thee openly” (Matt. vi.,\r\n4). “Judge not, that ye be not judged” (Matt. vii., 1). “But if ye\r\nforgive not men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your\r\ntrespasses” (Matt. vi., 15). Jesus had no high opinion of the influence\r\nof altruism on human conduct.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer in his treatise on morality (_The Data of Ethics_)\r\nalso insists that laws of conduct, to be of general application, must\r\nnot require men to make too great sacrifices, as otherwise the best\r\nteaching would remain a dead letter. He imagines, however, that in the\r\nfuture the human race will be so much improved that moral conduct will\r\nbecome instinctive, needing no compulsion. The English philosopher\r\npresents a view of the future of the human race totally at variance\r\nwith the Kantian conception. Instead of human beings becoming filled\r\nwith a sense of duty opposed to their natural instincts, the world will\r\nbe peopled with men acting morally from inclination, so making the\r\nworld delightful.\r\n\r\nThe ideal is so far removed from existing conditions that the\r\npossibility of its attainment is hardly worth considering. It is\r\nprobable that a world whose inhabitants had the feeling of sympathy\r\nvery highly developed would not be so delightful. For sympathy is\r\ngenerally a reaction against evil. When evil disappears, sympathy would\r\nbe not merely useless, but annoying and harmful.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot in _Middlemarch_ describes a young woman enthusiastically\r\nanxious to do good to her fellows. When she came to live in a village,\r\nshe made great plans to succour its poor. Her disillusion and annoyance\r\nwere great when she found that the villagers were quite comfortably\r\noff, and had no need of her charity.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill in his _Autobiography_ relates that when he was young\r\nhe dreamed of reforming society and making everyone happy. But when he\r\nasked himself if the accomplishment of his beautiful ideas would make\r\nhim happy, he was compelled to answer “No!” and this discovery plunged\r\nthe young philosopher into a lamentable condition. He described himself\r\nas quite overcome, all that supported him in life crumbling away. His\r\nhappiness could lie only in the constant pursuit of his object, and\r\nthe charm seemed broken, because if attainment were not to please him,\r\nhow could the means be of any interest to him? It seemed to him that\r\nnothing was left to which he could dedicate his life.\r\n\r\nAs it is highly probable that with the advance of civilisation\r\nthe greatest evils of humanity will become lessened, and may even\r\ndisappear, the sacrifices to be made will also become less. Now that\r\nthere is a serum which protects against plague, there is no room for\r\nthe heroism of the doctors who used to incur the greatest danger in\r\nfighting epidemics. Until lately doctors used to risk their life in\r\ntreating the throats of diphtheric patients. A young doctor who was\r\na friend of mine, of high ability and promise, died from diphtheria\r\ncontracted under these conditions. He met his death, in isolation from\r\nhis friends in case of infecting them, with the utmost heroism. Now\r\nthat the anti-diphtheric serum has been discovered, such heroism would\r\nbe unnecessary. The advance of science has removed the occasion of such\r\nsacrifices.\r\n\r\nIt is now very long since there has been opportunity for the heroism\r\nwhich steeled the hand of Abraham to sacrifice his only son to his\r\nreligion. Human sacrifice, based on the highest morality, has become\r\nmore and more rare, and will finally disappear. Rational morality,\r\nalthough it may admire such conduct, has no use for it. So also, it\r\nmay foresee a time when men will be so highly developed that instead\r\nof being delighted to take advantage of the sympathy of their fellows,\r\nthey will refuse it absolutely. Neither the Kantian idea of virtue,\r\ndoing good as a pure duty, nor that of Herbert Spencer, according to\r\nwhich men have an instinctive need to help their fellows, will be\r\nrealised in the future. The ideal will rather be that of men who will\r\nbe self-sufficient and who will no longer permit others to do them\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nORTHOBIOSIS\r\n\r\n  Human nature must be modified according to an\r\n  ideal—Comparison with the modification of the\r\n  constitution of plants and of animals—Schlanstedt\r\n  rye—Burbank’s plants—The ideal of orthobiosis—The\r\n  immorality of ignorance—The place of hygiene in the\r\n  social life—The place of altruism in moral conduct—The\r\n  freedom of the theory of orthobiosis from metaphysics\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have shown in _The Nature of Man_, the human constitution as it\r\nexists to-day, being the result of a long evolution and containing a\r\nlarge animal element, cannot furnish the basis of rational morality.\r\nThe conception which has come down from antiquity to modern times, of\r\na harmonious activity of all the organs, is no longer appropriate to\r\nmankind. Organs which are in course of atrophy must not be reawakened,\r\nand many natural characters which perhaps were useful in the case of\r\nanimals must be made to disappear in men.\r\n\r\nHuman nature, which, like the constitutions of other organisms, is\r\nsubject to evolution, must be modified according to a definite ideal.\r\nJust as a gardener or stock raiser is not content with the existing\r\nnature of the plants and animals with which he is occupied, but\r\nmodifies them to suit his purposes, so also the scientific philosopher\r\nmust not think of existing human nature as immutable, but must try to\r\nmodify it for the advantage of mankind.\r\n\r\nAs bread is the chief article in human food, attempts to improve\r\ncereals have been made for a very long time. Rimpau made one of the\r\ngreatest steps in this direction when he introduced into cultivation a\r\nvariety of rye known as Schlanstedt rye, now fairly abundant in France\r\nand Germany. Rimpau set himself the task of producing a variety with\r\nthe longest ears and containing many and heavy grains. Having conceived\r\nhis ideal, he began to seek out what was nearest to it in a very large\r\nnumber of examples of rye. After patient and continued labour, using\r\ncareful selection and cross-fertilisation, Rimpau succeeded in making\r\nthe new variety, and so did a great service to mankind.\r\n\r\nBurbank,[230] an American horticulturist, has recently gained a wide\r\nreputation because of his improvements of useful plants. He has\r\nproduced a new kind of potato which has raised the value of potato\r\ncrops in the United States by about £3,500,000 per annum. Burbank\r\ncultivated great numbers of fruit trees, flowers, and all kinds of\r\nplants, with the object of increasing their utility. One of his objects\r\nwas to produce varieties which could resist dry conditions, which\r\nreproduced rapidly and so forth. He has modified the nature of plants\r\nto such an extent that he has cactus plants and brambles without\r\nthorns. The succulent leaves of the former provide an excellent food\r\nfor cattle, whilst the absence of thorns in the latter makes their\r\npleasant fruit more suitable for gardens. Burbank has enormously\r\nimproved the production of stoneless plums, and has very much reduced\r\nthe price of many bulbs and lilies by increasing their productivity.\r\n\r\nTo obtain such results much knowledge and a long period of time\r\nwere necessary. To modify the nature of plants it was necessary to\r\nunderstand them well. To frame the new ideal of the plant it was\r\nnecessary not only to have an exact conception of what was wanted, but\r\nto find out if the qualities of the plants in question furnished any\r\nhope of realising it.\r\n\r\nThe methods which have been successful in the case of plants and\r\nanimals must be much modified for application to the human race. In\r\nthe case of human beings the selection and cross-breeding which were\r\nimposed upon rye and plum trees are not possible, but, at the same\r\ntime, the ideal of human nature, towards which mankind ought to press,\r\nmay be formed. In our opinion this ideal is orthobiosis, that is to\r\nsay, the development of the human life so that it passes through a long\r\nperiod of old age in active and vigorous health, leading to the final\r\nperiod in which there shall be present a sense of satiety of life,\r\nand a wish for death. I do not think that the ideal should be that of\r\nHerbert Spencer, a simple prolongation of human life. When the instinct\r\nof death comes at a not very late period of life, there would be no\r\ninconvenience in shortening the life, if death did not come soon after\r\nthe appearance of the instinct. Probably this would be the only case\r\nwhere suicide was justified in the conception of orthobiosis.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is the case of an action in conformity with the\r\nideal, but quite contrary to human nature as it is at present. A\r\nsimilar contradiction appears in reproduction. Man came from animals\r\namongst which unlimited reproduction was an important factor in the\r\npreservation of the species, as it allowed the species to survive under\r\nall sorts of bad conditions, such as diseases, combats, attacks of\r\nenemies, and changes of climate. Although man, according to the laws of\r\nhuman nature, is capable of reproducing extremely rapidly, the ideal\r\nof his happiness makes a restriction of this power necessary. Thus\r\northobiosis, based upon knowledge of human nature, would set limits to\r\na function which is perhaps the most natural of all. The restriction\r\nwhich is already partially adopted will come more and more into\r\noperation as the struggle against diseases, the prolongation of human\r\nlife, and the suppression of war make progress. It will be one of the\r\nchief means of diminishing the most brutal forms of the struggle for\r\nexistence, and of increasing moral conduct amongst mankind.\r\n\r\nJust as Rimpau began to study the nature of plants before trying to\r\nrealise his ideal, so also varied and profound knowledge is the first\r\nrequisite for the ideal of moral conduct. It is necessary not only to\r\nknow the structure and function of the human organism, but to have\r\nexact ideas on human life as it is in society. Scientific knowledge\r\nis so indispensable for moral conduct that ignorance must be placed\r\namong the most immoral acts. A mother who rears her child in defiance\r\nof good hygiene, from want of knowledge, is acting immorally towards\r\nher offspring, notwithstanding her feeling of sympathy. And this also\r\nis true of a Government which remains in ignorance of the laws which\r\nregulate human life and human society.\r\n\r\nIt must be well understood that I am not here thinking of written\r\nknowledge, set down in treatises and volumes. Rimpau and Burbank went\r\noutside manuals of botany to obtain their knowledge. Besides books,\r\nwide ideas on the practice of life are required to direct aright the\r\nconduct of men. A doctor who has just finished his studies at the\r\nhospital, notwithstanding all his knowledge, is not yet sufficiently\r\ntrained to be a good practitioner. He must acquire the habit of\r\ntreating patients, and for this years are required. So also is it with\r\nregard to the practical applications of the principles of morality.\r\nThe regulation of conduct requires profound knowledge both theoretical\r\nand practical, and men selected to frame or to apply laws of morality\r\nmust have this double qualification. If the human race come to adopt\r\nthe principles of orthobiosis, a considerable change in the qualities\r\nof men of different ages will follow. Old age will be postponed so\r\nmuch that men of from sixty to seventy years of age will retain their\r\nvigour, and will not require to ask assistance in the fashion now\r\nnecessary. On the other hand, young men of twenty-one years of age will\r\nno longer be thought mature or ready to fulfil functions so difficult\r\nas taking a share in public affairs. The view which I set forth in\r\n_The Nature of Man_ regarding the danger which comes from the present\r\ninterference of young men in political affairs has since then been\r\nconfirmed in the most striking fashion.\r\n\r\nIt is easily intelligible that in the new conditions such modern idols\r\nas universal suffrage, public opinion, and the _referendum_, in which\r\nthe ignorant masses are called on to decide questions which demand\r\nvaried and profound knowledge, will last no longer than the old idols.\r\nThe progress of human knowledge will bring about the replacement\r\nof such institutions by others, in which applied morality will be\r\ncontrolled by the really competent persons. I permit myself to suppose\r\nthat in these times, scientific training will be much more general than\r\nit is just now, and that it will occupy the place which it deserves in\r\neducation and in life.\r\n\r\nIt is equally clear that if a mother is to act morally with regard to\r\nher child, she must teach herself properly. In place of mythology and\r\nliterature, she must learn hygiene and all that relates to the rational\r\nrearing of children. So, also, in the education of men, the study of\r\nthe exact sciences must occupy by far the most important place. Then\r\nonly will moral conduct and scientific knowledge begin to unite. An\r\nignorant mother will bring up a child very badly notwithstanding all\r\nher good will and her affection. A doctor, however imbued with strong\r\nsympathy for his patients, could do them much harm if he had not the\r\nappropriate knowledge. Are not politicians open to the reproach from\r\nthe point of view of morality that very often through ignorance they\r\ndo the very worst evil in public administration? With the progress of\r\nknowledge, moral conduct and useful conduct will become more and more\r\nclosely identified.\r\n\r\nI have been reproached because in my system the health of the body\r\noccupies too large a place. It cannot be otherwise, because health\r\ncertainly plays the chief part in existence. Notwithstanding his\r\npessimism, Schopenhauer was convinced that health was the greatest\r\ntreasure, a treasure before which everything else yielded. In many\r\nreligions care of the health is laid down amongst the chief duties.\r\nAlthough many scientific men do not hold the opinion that circumcision\r\nwas ordained for hygienic reasons, it is certain that hygiene was\r\nextremely important in the Jewish religion. It is only in Christianity,\r\nwhich despises the human body, that hygiene is excluded from the\r\nreligious code, as in the words of Jesus:-\r\n\r\n“Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall\r\ndrink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life\r\nmore than meat, and the body than raiment?” (Matt. vi., 25). As for\r\nlong ages hygiene was very imperfectly known, it is not surprising\r\nthat it played a small part in human affairs. Probably the objection\r\nto the importance that I assign to it in orthobiosis is a relic from\r\nthe old order of things. Now, however, the situation is different.\r\nBacteriology has placed hygiene on a scientific foundation, so that the\r\nlatter is now one of the exact sciences. It has now become necessary\r\nto give it the chief place in applied morality as it is the branch of\r\nknowledge that teaches how men ought to live.\r\n\r\nIt has been objected that I have left no place for altruism in my\r\nsystem.[231] Certainly I have tried to find an egoistic basis for\r\nmoral conduct, as I have shown above. I think, however, that the wish\r\nto live according to the ideal of orthobiosis and to make others live\r\na normal life would be a powerful agency in improving social life, in\r\npreventing mutual damage, and promoting mutual help. Such a motive,\r\nwithin the reach of persons whose altruistic feelings are not specially\r\nstrong, must largely extend moral conduct amongst human beings, and\r\neven although in future such manifestations of high morality as the\r\nsacrifice of life and health will become wholly or nearly wholly\r\nuseless, I think that for the present there is still room for altruism.\r\nThe practical application of scientific knowledge already gained admits\r\nmuch self-denial and good feeling. Struggle against prejudices of\r\nall kinds and the development and diffusion of sound ideas require a\r\nconduct very highly altruistic.\r\n\r\nThe fears of my opponents are still less justified when we reflect that\r\nthe feelings of sympathy and of cohesion must play a large part in the\r\nbusiness of helping the evolution of man towards the goal of normal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAlthough our actual knowledge already provides a basis of rational\r\nmorality, it may be admitted that in the future, if science continues\r\nits forward march, the rules of moral conduct will become still more\r\nimproved. There will be no ground for reproaching me for a blind faith\r\nin the all-powerfulness of science. Much more trust can be given to\r\none who has faithfully carried out his promises, than to one who has\r\npromised much and fulfilled nothing. Science has already justified the\r\nhopes which have been placed in it. It has saved people from the most\r\nterrible diseases, and has made life much easier. On the other hand,\r\nreligions, which demand an uncritical faith as the means of curing the\r\nills which afflict humanity, have not fulfilled their promises.\r\n\r\nThe reproach that I preach blind faith in the progress of science,\r\ndestined to replace religious faith, is unjust, because my faith\r\ndepends on a confidence that science has already deserved. Equally\r\nunjust is the reproach that I have built my system on a partly\r\nmetaphysical principle. According to M. Parodi,[232] the hypothesis of\r\nphysiological old age and of natural death seem to “involve the idea\r\nof a natural duration of human life, which, however, from accidental\r\nreasons man does not complete at present. M. Metchnikoff repeatedly\r\nuses the expression ‘normal cycle.’ Now do we not see here the\r\nsurreptitious repetition of the old teleological conception of nature,\r\nalthough at first he so energetically disavowed it? It is the belief\r\nthat the species is a necessary reality, corresponding to a definite\r\ntype of its own, in fact a special design of nature; that nature,\r\nto guide herself, had an ideal which circumstances could mistake or\r\ndegrade, but which had to be restored to its perfect form? Otherwise,\r\nwhy does he insist that there must be a condition of perfect and stable\r\nequilibrium between individual and environment? that there is a normal\r\ncycle and that it must be possible to harmonise the disharmonies?”\r\n\r\nI can show easily that all these objections rest upon a simple\r\nmisunderstanding. I have never conceived of the existence of any ideal\r\nof nature or of the inevitable necessity of transforming disharmonies\r\nto harmonies. I have no knowledge of the “designs” and “motives” of\r\nnature; I have never taken my stand on metaphysical ground. I have not\r\nthe remotest idea if nature has any ideal and if the appearance of\r\nman on the earth were a part of such an ideal. What I have spoken of\r\nis the ideal of man corresponding to the need to ward off the great\r\nevils of old age as it is now, and of death as we see it around us.\r\nI have said, moreover, that human nature, that collection of complex\r\nfeatures of multiple origin, contains certain elements which may be\r\nused to modify it according to our human ideal. I have done nothing\r\nbut what the horticulturist does when he finds in the nature of plants\r\nelements which suggest to him to try and make new and improved races.\r\nJust as the constitution of some plum trees contains elements which\r\nmake it possible to produce plums without stones which are pleasanter\r\nto eat, so also in our own nature there exist characters which make\r\nit possible to transform our disharmonious nature into a harmonious\r\none, in accordance with our ideal, and able to bring us happiness. I\r\nhave not the smallest idea what ideal nature may have on the subject\r\nof plums, but I know very well that man has such designs and such\r\nan ideal as form a point of departure for the transformation of the\r\nnature of plums. Substitute man for the plum tree and you are at my\r\npoint of view. When I have spoken of the normal cycle of life or of\r\nphysiological old age, I have used the words normal and physiological\r\nonly in relation to our ideal of the human constitution. I might just\r\nas well have said that a cactus without thorns is the normal cactus in\r\nthe conditions where it was desired to obtain a succulent plant useful\r\nas food for cattle. The words “normal” and “physiological” seemed to\r\nme more convenient than such a phrase as “in correspondence with human\r\nideals.”\r\n\r\nI am so little convinced of the existence of any disposition of nature\r\nto transform our ills into goods, and our disharmonies into harmonies,\r\nthat it would not surprise me if such an ideal were never reached. Even\r\nin unmetaphysical circles it is said that nature has the intention of\r\npreserving the species at the expense of the individual. The ground\r\nof this is that the species survives the individual. On the other\r\nhand, very many species have completely disappeared. Amongst these\r\nspecies were animals very highly organised, such as some anthropoid\r\napes (_Dryopithecus_, etc.). As nature has not spared these, how can\r\nwe be certain that she is not ready to deal with the human race in the\r\nsame way. It is impossible for us to know the unknown, its plans and\r\nmotives. We must leave nature on one side and concern ourselves with\r\nwhat is more congruous with our intelligence.\r\n\r\nOur intelligence informs us that man is capable of much, and for\r\nthis reason we hope that he may be able to modify his own nature and\r\ntransform his disharmonies into harmonies. It is only human will that\r\ncan attain this ideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Westergaard, _Mortalitaet u. Morbilitaet_, 2nd.

Ellenberger (_Archiv. f.\r\nAnatomie u. Physiologie, Physiologische Abtheilung_, 1906, p. 139),\r\nthe cæca of the horse, pig and rabbit, play an active part in the\r\ndigestion of vegetable matter, which is rich in cellulose. At the end\r\nof his treatise, Ellenberger insists that the vermiform appendix of the\r\ncæcum is not a rudimentary organ. The reason why the appendix can be\r\nremoved in the case of man without disturbance to the functions of the\r\nbody, is that this work can be performed by the Peyer’s patches of the\r\nintestine. The existence of the appendix is not necessary to the normal\r\nprocesses of the body, and is a real danger to health and sometimes to\r\nlife. Comparative study of the cæca in birds shows that these organs\r\nare in process of degeneration.\r\n\r\n[120] _Archiv. für experimentelle Pathologie_, vol. xxviii, p. 311.\r\n\r\n[121] _Sixième Congrès de Chirurgie_, Paris, 1903, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[122] _Leçons sur les auto-intoxications_, Paris, 1886.\r\n\r\n[123] _Zeitschrift für Hygiene_, 1892, vol. xii, p. 88.\r\n\r\n[124] _Zeitschrift für klinische Medicin_, 1903, vol. xlviii, p. 491.\r\n\r\n[125] There is a summary of this question in Gerhardt’s work on\r\nintestinal putrefaction, in _Ergebnisse der Physiologie_, 3rd year,\r\nsection 1, Wiesbaden, 1904, pp. 107-154.\r\n\r\n[126] _The A B C of our Nutrition_, New York, 1903; Dr. Regnault, Nov.\r\n1, “L’art de manger,” _La Revue_, 1906, p. 92.\r\n\r\n[127] _Zeitschr. f. diatetische u. physikal.
