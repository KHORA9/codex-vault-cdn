ZAKRZEWSKA, M.D. (1829-1902)\r\n\r\n\r\n _Accoucheuse en chef, Royal Hospital Charité, Berlin, Prussia; First\r\n Resident Physician, New York Infirmary for Women and Children, New\r\n York; Professor of Obstetrics and Diseases of Women and Children, and\r\n Founder and Attending Physician of the Clinical Department (Hospital),\r\n New England Female Medical College, Boston; Founder and First\r\n Attending Physician, New England Hospital for Women and Children,\r\n Boston._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEDICATED TO\r\n\r\n  THE DEAR MEMORY OF A FRIEND\r\n\r\n  ELIZABETH BIGELOW CONANT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed impersonally, this story of Marie E. Zakrzewska (Zak-shef’ska)\r\nis one more document testifying to the Humanity of Woman. The fact that\r\nthe individual urge for the expression of this humanity found vent\r\nalong the line of Medicine, is a detail. It is also a detail that the\r\nstory is interwoven with an interesting transitional period in American\r\nhistory and with the evolution of the American woman physician.\r\n\r\nThe essential interest lies in the fundamental human instinct asserting\r\nitself through the individual woman, dominating her and driving her\r\nto reach out into the world until, after migrations over thousands of\r\nmiles and through various phases of civilization, she at last found an\r\nenvironment favorable for the development which her spirit so ardently\r\ndemanded.\r\n\r\nEventually stretching across the Atlantic Ocean, this Polish-German\r\nbranch of the Human Tree pushed through first one crevice and then\r\nanother, with here and there a struggling blossoming and leafage, to\r\nfind at last its best efflorescence and fruitage in the favoring sun\r\nand air of America.\r\n\r\nTransplanted here, as are all the nations of mankind, her life finally\r\nfound fulfillment through the creation of the New England Hospital for\r\nWomen and Children, and though the influence which she exerted upon\r\nthe lives of the numbers of women medical students, women physicians,\r\nwomen surgeons, and women nurses who have there, in turn, been helped\r\nto develop and to express _their_ Humanity.\r\n\r\nStopping on her way to help in the birth of the _first_ true\r\n“Woman’s Hospital” in the history of the world (the New York Infirmary\r\nfor Women and Children), to develop the short-lived _second_\r\n(Clinical Department of the New England Female Medical College), and to\r\nassist in the conception of the _third_ (the Woman’s Hospital of\r\nPhiladelphia), her life reached its fullest expression in the evolution\r\nof the _fourth_ (the New England Hospital for Women and Children).\r\n\r\nThus in no ordinary sense do the life and personality of Doctor\r\nZakrzewska endure in America, and especially in Boston. Thence the\r\ninspiration of her life has extended throughout New England; throughout\r\nthe United States; back across the Atlantic to Europe; and across the\r\nPacific to the Orient.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, any part of the earth reached by educated medical women\r\nwhere her living spirit does not penetrate, that unconquerable spirit\r\nmade manifest through her unchanging ideal--reasoned human standards\r\nfor women as for men.\r\n\r\nIt is a common habit of our people to abbreviate long or unfamiliar\r\nwords and the American populace so generally declined to apply itself\r\nto the complete pronunciation of the word _Zakrzewska_ that the\r\nname was characteristically shortened to the first syllable. Hence,\r\n“Doctor Zak” became the more familiar title, first of convenience and\r\nthen of that personal and unceremonious aptitude for appropriation\r\nwhich we as a people display toward those whom we regard with\r\nadmiration and affection.\r\n\r\nThe material for this biography was given to the editor by Dr.\r\nZakrzewska to prepare for publication with what might be called one\r\ncondition, and this has now been fulfilled. Circumstances which the\r\neditor could not control, and which it is unnecessary to discuss\r\nhere, have delayed its appearance until now. The earlier chapters are\r\nautobiographical and most of them were written in the form of a letter\r\nto Miss Mary L. Booth, of New York, and were published in 1860 by\r\nMrs. Caroline H. Dall under the title of “A Practical Illustration of\r\n‘Woman’s Right to Labor’; or A Letter from Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D.,\r\nlate of Berlin, Prussia.”\r\n\r\nFinally, the editor desires to express her appreciation of the\r\nassistance rendered by Miss Anne Sullivan, her secretary and synergetic\r\ncritic.\r\n\r\n  AGNES C.

I shall therefore tell you only a few facts of this\r\nperiod of my life, which I think absolutely necessary to illustrate my\r\ncharacter and nature.\r\n\r\nI was born in Berlin, Prussia, on the 6th of September, 1829; and am\r\nthe eldest of a family of five sisters and one brother.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] The figures throughout the text refer to corresponding numbers in\r\nNotes, pages 483 to 498.\r\n\r\nMy early childhood passed happily, though heavy clouds of sorrow and\r\ncare at times overshadowed our family circle. I was of a cheerful\r\ndisposition, and was always in good humor, even when sick. I was quiet\r\nand gentle in all my amusements. My chief delight consisted in telling\r\nstories to my sister, one year younger than myself. She was always\r\nglad to listen to these products of my imagination, which were wholly\r\noriginal, for no stories were told me, nor had I any children’s books.\r\n\r\nMy heroes and heroines were generally distinguished for some mental\r\npeculiarity--as kind or cruel, active or indolent--which led them into\r\nall sorts of adventures till it suited my caprice to terminate their\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nIn all our little affairs I took the lead, planning and directing\r\neverything; and my playmates seemed to take it for granted that it was\r\ntheir duty to carry out my commands.\r\n\r\nMy memory is remarkable in respect to events that occurred at this\r\ntime, but it always fails to recall dates and names.\r\n\r\nWhen twenty years of age, I asked my father what sort of a festival he\r\ntook me to once, in company with a friend of his who had only one arm.\r\nWe walked through meadows where daisies were blossoming in millions and\r\nrode in carriages that went round continually until they were wound up.\r\n\r\nMy father answered, with much surprise, that it was a public festival\r\nof the cabinet-makers, which was celebrated in a neighboring village,\r\nand that I was, at that time, only nineteen months old. He was so much\r\ninterested in my story that I related another of my memories.\r\n\r\nOne dark morning, my mother wakened me and hastened my dressing. After\r\nthis was accomplished, she handed me a cup of something which I had\r\nnever tasted before and which was as disagreeable as was asafœtida in\r\nlater years. This was some coffee which I had to take instead of my\r\nusual milk.\r\n\r\nThen I went with my father to the large park called “The Thiergarten,”\r\nwhere we saw the sun rise. I began to spring about, looking at the\r\nbig oaks which seemed to reach into the heavens, or stooping down to\r\npluck a flower. Birds of all kinds were singing in chorus, while the\r\nflower-beds surrounding the statue of Flora scented the pure morning\r\nair with the sweetest of perfumes.\r\n\r\nThe sun ascended meanwhile, from the edge of a little pond covered with\r\nwater-lilies. I was intoxicated with joy. The feeling of that morning\r\nis as fresh to-day as when I related this to my father. I know I\r\nwalked till I got fairly tired, and we reached a solitary house beyond\r\nthe park.\r\n\r\nProbably fatigue took entire possession of me, for I remember nothing\r\nmore till we were on our way home and the sun was setting. Then I\r\nbegged for some large yellow plums which I saw in the stores. My father\r\nbought some, but gave me only a few. I had a desire for all and stole\r\nthem secretly from his pockets, so that when we reached home, I had\r\neaten them all.\r\n\r\nI was sick after I went to bed, and remember taking some horrible stuff\r\nthe next morning (probably rhubarb), thus ending the day which had\r\nopened so poetically in rather a prosaic manner.\r\n\r\nWhen I repeated this, my parents laughed and said that I was only\r\ntwenty-six months old when my father’s pride in his oldest child\r\ninduced him to take me on this visit, and that I walked the whole\r\nway--a distance of about _nine miles_.\r\n\r\nThese anecdotes are worth preserving only because they indicate an\r\nimpressionable nature and great muscular endurance.\r\n\r\nIt is peculiar that between these two events and a third which occurred\r\na year after, everything should be a blank.\r\n\r\nA little brother was then born to me, and he lay undressed upon a\r\ncushion, while my father cried with sobs. I had just completed my third\r\nyear and could not understand why, the next day, this little thing was\r\ncarried off in a black box. From that time I remember almost every\r\nday’s life.\r\n\r\nI very soon began to manifest the course of my natural tendencies. Like\r\nmost little girls I was well provided with dolls, and on the day after\r\na new one came into my possession I generally discovered that the dear\r\nlittle thing was ill and needed to be nursed and doctored.\r\n\r\nPorridges and teas were accordingly cooked on my little toy stove,\r\nand administered to the poor doll until the _papier mâché_ was\r\nthoroughly saturated and broken, when she was considered dead and\r\npreparations were made for her burial--this ceremony being repeated\r\nover and over again.\r\n\r\nWhite dresses were put on for the funeral; a cricket was turned upside\r\ndown to serve as the coffin; my mother’s flower pots furnished the\r\ngreen leaves for decoration; and I delivered the funeral oration in\r\npraise of the little sufferer while placing her in the tomb improvised\r\nof chairs.\r\n\r\nI hardly ever joined the other children in their plays except upon\r\noccasions like these, when I appeared in the characters of doctor,\r\npriest and undertaker; generally improving the opportunity to moralize,\r\ninforming my audience that Ann (the doll) had died in consequence of\r\ndisobeying her mother by going out before she had recovered from the\r\nmeasles, etc.\r\n\r\nOnce I remember moving my audience to tears by telling them that little\r\nAnn had been killed by her brother who, in amusing himself with picking\r\noff the dry skin after she had had the scarlatina, had carelessly torn\r\noff the real skin over the heart, as they could see; thus leaving it to\r\nbeat in the air and causing the little one to die. This happened after\r\nwe had all had the scarlatina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n _Begins school life--Her conduct already guided by habits of\r\n reasoning and self-government--Conflict between such guidance and\r\n the school rule of unquestioning obedience to authority--First\r\n friendship with a girl--First contact with an insane person; changes\r\n an intractable patient to a docile one--Allowed to assist nurse in\r\n hospital in care of blind cousin--Observation of defects in hospital\r\n care arouses desire to be some day a head nurse, so as to prevent such\r\n defects and have patients treated more kindly. (Five to nine years of\r\n age: 1834-1838.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen five years old, I was sent to a primary school. Here I became a\r\nfavorite of the teacher of arithmetic, for which study I had quite a\r\nfancy. The rest of the teachers disliked me. They called me unruly\r\nbecause I would not obey arbitrary demands without being given some\r\nreason, and obstinate because I insisted on following my own will when\r\nI knew I was in the right.\r\n\r\nI was told that I was not worthy to be with my playmates; and when I\r\nreached the highest class in the school, in which alone the boys and\r\nthe girls were taught separately, I was separated from the latter and\r\nplaced with the boys by way of punishment, receiving instructions with\r\nthem from men, while the girls in the other class were taught by women.\r\n\r\nHere I found many friends. I joined the boys in all their sports,\r\nsliding and snowballing with them in winter, and running and playing\r\nball in summer. With them I was merry, frank and self-possessed, while\r\nwith the girls I was quiet, shy and awkward. I never made friends with\r\nthe girls or felt like approaching them.\r\n\r\nOnce only, when I was eleven years old, a girl in the young ladies’\r\nseminary in which I had been placed when eight years of age won my\r\naffection. This was Elizabeth Hohenhorst, a child of twelve, remarkably\r\nquiet and disposed to melancholy.\r\n\r\nShe was a devout Catholic, and knowing that she was fated to become a\r\nnun, was fitting herself for that dreary destiny, which rendered her\r\nvery sentimental. She was full of fanciful visions, but extremely sweet\r\nand gentle in her manners. My love for her was unbounded. I went to\r\nchurch in her company, was present at all the religious festivals, and\r\naccompanied her to receive religious instruction: in short, I made up\r\nmy mind to become a Catholic and, if possible, a nun like herself. My\r\nparents, who were Rationalists, belonging to no church, gave me full\r\nscope to follow out my own inclinations, leaving it to my nature to\r\nchoose for me a fitting path.\r\n\r\nThis lasted until Elizabeth went for the first time to the\r\nconfessional. And when the poor innocent child could find no other\r\nsin of which to speak than the friendship which she cherished for a\r\nProtestant, the priest forbade her to continue this, until I too had\r\nbecome a Catholic, reminding her of the holiness of her future career.\r\nThe poor girl conscientiously promised to obey.\r\n\r\nWhen I came the next morning and spoke to her as usual, she turned away\r\nfrom me and burst into tears. Surprised and anxious, I asked what was\r\nthe matter. In a voice broken with sobs, she told me the whole story\r\nand begged me to become a Catholic as soon as I was fourteen years old.\r\n\r\nNever in my whole life shall I forget that morning. For a moment, I\r\ngazed on her with the deepest emotion, pitying her almost more than\r\nmyself; then suddenly turned coldly and calmly away without answering a\r\nsingle word. My mind had awakened to the despotism of theology and the\r\nchurch had lost its expected convert. I never went near her again and\r\nnever exchanged another word with her. This was the only friend I had\r\nduring eight and a half years of uninterrupted attendance at school.\r\n\r\nA visit that I paid to my maternal grandfather when seven or eight\r\nyears old made a strong impression on my mind.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, on his return from the war of 1813-1815 in which he\r\nhad served, had received from the authorities of Prenzlau (the city in\r\nwhich he lived) a grant of a half-ruined cloister with about a hundred\r\nacres of uncultivated land attached, by way of acknowledgment of his\r\nservices. He removed thither with his family, and, shortly after,\r\ninvited the widows of some soldiers who lived in the city to occupy the\r\napartments which he did not need. The habitable rooms were soon filled\r\nto overflowing with widows and orphans, who went to work with him to\r\ncultivate the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before crippled and invalid soldiers arrived, begging\r\nto be allowed to repair the cloister and to find a shelter also within\r\nits walls. They were set to work making brick, the material for which\r\nmy grandfather had discovered on his land: and in about five years\r\nan institution was built, the more valuable from the fact that none\r\nlived there on charity but all earned what they needed by cultivating\r\nthe ground; having first built their own dwelling which at this time\r\nlooked like a palace surrounded by trees, grass and flowers. Here, in\r\nthe evening, the old soldiers sang martial songs or told stories of the\r\nwars to the orphans gathered about them, while resting from the labors\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\nI tell you of this institution so minutely to prove to you how wrong it\r\nis to provide charitable homes for the poor as we provide them, homes\r\nin which the charity always humiliates and degrades the individual.\r\nHere you have an instance in which poor crippled invalids and destitute\r\nwomen and children established and supported themselves under the\r\nguidance of a clear-headed, benevolent man, who said, “Do what you\r\nlike, but work for what you need.” He succeeded admirably, though he\r\ndied a very poor man, his younger children becoming inmates of the\r\nestablishment until they were adopted by their relatives.\r\n\r\nWhen I visited my grandfather, the “convent,” as he insisted on\r\ncalling it--rejecting any name that would have indicated a charitable\r\ninstitution--contained about a hundred invalid soldiers, a hundred\r\nold women and two hundred and fifty orphans. One of the wings of the\r\nbuilding was fitted up as a hospital and a few of the rooms were\r\noccupied by lunatics.\r\n\r\nIt was my greatest delight to take my grandfather’s hand at noon as\r\nhe walked up and down the dining room between the long tables around\r\nwhich were grouped so many cheerful, hearty faces; and I stood before\r\nhim with an admiration that it is impossible to describe as he prayed,\r\nwith his black velvet cap in his hand, before and after dinner. Though\r\nI could not comprehend why he should thank another person for what had\r\nbeen done, when every one there told me that all that they had they\r\nowed to my grandfather.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, on returning from the dining room to his study, I spied\r\non his desk a neatly written manuscript. I took it up and began to\r\nread. It was a dissertation on immortality, attempting by scientific\r\narguments to prove its impossibility. I became greatly interested, and\r\nread on without noticing that my grandfather had left the room or that\r\nthe large bell had rung to call the family to dinner.\r\n\r\nMy grandfather, a very punctual man who would never allow lingering,\r\ncame back to call and to reprimand me; he suddenly started on seeing\r\nthe paper in my hands and snatching it from me tore it in pieces,\r\nexclaiming, “That man is insane, and will make this child so too!” A\r\nlittle frightened, I went to the dinner table, thinking as much about\r\nmy grandfather’s words as about what I had read, without daring,\r\nhowever, to ask who this man was.\r\n\r\nThe next day, curiosity mastered fear. I asked my grandfather who had\r\nwritten that paper, and was told in reply that it was poor crazy Jacob.\r\nI then begged to see him, but this request my grandfather decidedly\r\nrefused, saying that he was like a wild beast and lay without clothes\r\nupon the straw. I knew nothing of lunatics, and the idea of a wild\r\nman stimulated my curiosity to such an extent that from that time I\r\nteased my grandfather incessantly to let me see Jacob. He finally\r\nyielded to be rid of my importunity and led me to the cell in which\r\nhe was confined. What a spectacle presented itself in the house that\r\nI had looked on as the abode of so much comfort! On a bundle of straw\r\nin a corner of the room, with no furniture save its bare walls, sat\r\na man clad only in a shirt, with the left hand chained to the wall\r\nand the right foot to the floor. An inkstand stood on the floor by\r\nhis side, and on his knee was some paper on which he was writing. His\r\nhair and beard were uncombed, and his fine eyes glared with fury as we\r\napproached him. He tried to rise, ground his teeth, made grimaces, and\r\nshook his fist at my grandfather, who tried in vain to draw me out of\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nBut, escaping from his grasp, I stepped towards the lunatic who grew\r\nmore quiet when he saw me approach, and I tried to lift the chain which\r\nhad attracted my attention. Then, finding it too heavy for me, I turned\r\nto my grandfather and asked, “Does not this hurt the poor man?” I had\r\nhardly spoken the words when his fury returned, and he shrieked:\r\n\r\n“Have I not always told you that you were cruel to me? Must this child\r\ncome to convince you of your barbarity? Yes, you have no heart.”\r\n\r\nI looked at my grandfather: all my admiration of him was gone, and I\r\nsaid, almost commandingly:\r\n\r\n“Take off these chains! It is bad of you to tie this man!”\r\n\r\nThe man grew calm at once and asked imploringly to be set free,\r\npromising to be quiet and tractable if my grandfather would give him a\r\ntrial. His chains were removed the same day, and Jacob was ever after\r\nnot only harmless and obedient but a very useful man in the house.\r\n\r\nI never afterwards accompanied my grandfather. I had discovered a side\r\nin his nature which repelled me. I spent the remainder of my visit in\r\nthe work rooms and the sick room, always secretly fearing that I should\r\nmeet with some new cruelty, but no such instance ever came to my view.\r\n\r\nOn my return from my grandfather’s I found that a cousin had suddenly\r\nbecome blind. She was soon after sent to the ophthalmic hospital, where\r\nshe remained for more than a year, and, during this time, I was her\r\nconstant companion after school hours. I was anxious to be useful to\r\nher; and being gentler than the nurse, she liked to have me wash out\r\nthe issues that were made in her back and arms. The nurse, who was very\r\nwilling to be relieved of this duty, allowed me also to cleanse the\r\neyes of the girl next my cousin; and thus these cares were soon made to\r\ndepend on my daily visit.\r\n\r\nChild as I was, I could not help observing the carelessness of the\r\nnurses and their great neglect of cleanliness. One day, when the head\r\nnurse had washed the floor and left pools of water standing under the\r\nbeds, the under nurse found fault with it, and said, “I shall tell the\r\ndoctor when he comes why it is that the patients always have colds.”\r\n“Do,” said the head nurse. “What do men understand of such matters? If\r\nthey knew anything about them, they would long ago have taken care\r\nthat the mattress upon which one patient dies should always be changed\r\nbefore another comes in.”\r\n\r\nThis quarrel impressed itself upon my memory, and the wish rose in my\r\nmind that some day I might be a head nurse to prevent such wrongs and\r\nto show kindness to poor lunatics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n _School life continues--Her mother begins training for career of\r\n midwife--Because of eye trouble, Marie resides in hospital with her\r\n mother, and becomes protégée of Dr. Müller--First real knowledge of\r\n medicine as a career--Adventure in morgue and dissecting rooms--Begins\r\n to read medical books. (Nine to eleven years of age: 1838-1840.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, my cousin left the hospital. At the same time,\r\ntrouble and constant sickness fell upon our family.\r\n\r\nMy father, who held liberal opinions and was of an impetuous\r\ntemperament, manifested some revolutionary tendencies, which drew upon\r\nhim the displeasure of the government and caused his dismissal, with\r\na very small pension, from his position as military officer. This\r\ninvolved us in great pecuniary difficulties, for our family was large\r\nand my father’s income too small to supply the most necessary wants,\r\nand to obtain other occupation was for the time out of the question.\r\n\r\nIn this emergency, my mother determined to petition the city government\r\nfor admission to the school of midwives established in Berlin, in order\r\nin this manner to aid in the support of the family. Influential friends\r\nof my father secured her the election, and she was admitted to the\r\nschool in 1839, I being at that time ten years of age.\r\n\r\nThe education of midwives for Berlin requires a two years’ course of\r\nstudy, during six months of which, they are obliged to reside in the\r\nhospital to receive instructions from the professors together with the\r\nmale students. My mother went there in the summer of 1840. I went to\r\nstay at the house of an aunt who wished my company, and the rest of the\r\nchildren were put out together, to board.\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks my eyes became affected with weakness so that I could\r\nneither read nor write, and I begged my mother to let me stay with\r\nher in the hospital. She applied for permission to the director and\r\nreceived a favorable answer.\r\n\r\nI was placed under the care of one of the physicians (Dr. Müller), who\r\ntook a great fancy to me and made me go with him wherever he went while\r\nengaged in the hospital. My eyes being bandaged, he led me by the hand,\r\ncalling me his “little blind doctor.” In this way, I was constantly\r\nwith him, hearing all his questions and directions, which impressed\r\nthemselves the more strongly on my mind from the fact that I could not\r\nsee but had to gain all my knowledge through hearing alone.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon, when I had taken the bandage off my eyes for the first\r\ntime, Dr. Müller told me that there was a corpse of a young man in the\r\ndead-house that had turned completely green in consequence of poison\r\nthat he had eaten. I went there after my rounds with him, but finding\r\nthe room filled with relatives who were busily engaged in adorning the\r\nbody with flowers, I thought that I would not disturb them but would\r\nwait until they had gone before I looked at it; meanwhile I went\r\nthrough the adjoining rooms.\r\n\r\nThese were all freshly painted. The dissecting tables, with the\r\nnecessary apparatus, stood in the center, while the bodies, clad\r\nin white gowns, were ranged on boards along the walls. I examined\r\neverything, came back, and looked to my heart’s content at the poisoned\r\nyoung man, without noticing that, not only had the relatives left but\r\nthe prosector had also gone away, after locking up the whole building.\r\n\r\nI then went a second time to the other rooms, and looked again at\r\neverything there; and at last, when it became dark and I could not\r\nleave the house, sat down upon the floor and went to sleep, after\r\nknocking for half an hour at the door in the hope that some passer\r\nmight hear.\r\n\r\nMy mother, who knew that I had gone with Dr. Müller, did not trouble\r\nherself about me until nine o’clock, when she grew uneasy at my stay;\r\nand, thinking that he might have taken me to his rooms, went there in\r\nsearch of me, but found that he was out and that the doors were locked.\r\nShe then inquired whether the people in the house knew anything about\r\nme, and was told that they had last seen me going into the dead-house.\r\nAlarmed at this intelligence, my mother hastened to the prosector, who\r\nunwillingly went with her to the park in which the dead-house stood,\r\nassuring her all the way that I could not possibly be there; but, on\r\nopening the door, he saw me sitting close by on the floor fast asleep.\r\n\r\nIn a few days after this adventure, I recovered the use of my eyes.\r\nAs it was at this time the summer vacation in which I had no school\r\ntasks, I asked Dr. Müller for some books to read. He inquired what\r\nkind of books I wanted. I told him, “Books about history,” upon which\r\nhe gave me two huge volumes, the _History of Midwifery_ and the\r\n_History of Surgery_. Both were so interesting that I read them\r\nthrough during the six weeks of vacation, which occupied me so closely\r\nthat even my friend Dr. Müller could not lay hold of me when he went\r\nhis morning and evening rounds.\r\n\r\nFrom this time I date my study of medicine, for though I did not\r\ncontinue to read on the subject, I was instructed in the no less\r\nimportant branch of psychology by a new teacher whom I found on my\r\nreturn to school at the close of the summer vacation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n _Takes highest prizes at school--Helpful friendship with one of\r\n her men teachers--Begins to understand relation of public opinion to\r\n personal conduct--School life ends. (Eleven to fourteen years of age:\r\n 1840-1843.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nTo explain better how my mind was prepared for such teaching, I must\r\ngo back to my position in school. In both schools that I attended I\r\nwas praised for my punctuality, industry and quick perception. Beloved\r\nI was in neither. On the contrary, I was made the target for all the\r\nimpudent jokes of my fellow pupils, ample material for which was\r\nfurnished in the carelessness with which my hair and dress were usually\r\narranged, these being left to the charge of a servant who troubled\r\nherself very little about how I looked, provided I was whole and clean.\r\n\r\nThe truth was, I often presented a ridiculous appearance; and once I\r\ncould not help laughing heartily at myself on seeing my own face by\r\naccident in a glass, with one braid of hair commencing over the right\r\neye and the other over the left ear. I quietly hung a map over the\r\nglass to hide the ludicrous picture and continued my studies, and most\r\nlikely appeared in the same style the next day.\r\n\r\nMy face, besides, was neither handsome nor even prepossessing, a large\r\nnose overshadowing the undeveloped features; and I was ridiculed for\r\nmy ugliness both in school and at home, where an aunt of mine who\r\ndisliked me exceedingly always said in describing plain people, “Almost\r\nas ugly as Marie.”\r\n\r\nAnother cause arose to render my position at school still more\r\nintolerable. In consequence of the loss of his position in the army, my\r\nfather could no longer afford to pay my school bills, and was about to\r\nremove me from school, when the principal offered to retain me without\r\npay. She disliked me and did not hesitate to show it, nor to tell me\r\nwhenever I offended her that she would never keep so ugly and naughty a\r\nchild _without being paid for it_, were it not for the sake of so\r\nnoble a father.\r\n\r\nThese conditions and harsh judgments made me a philosopher. I heard\r\nmyself called obstinate and willful, only because I believed myself\r\nin the right and persisted in it. I felt that I was not maliciously\r\ndisposed towards any one but wished well to all, and I offered my\r\nservices not only willingly, but cheerfully wherever they could be of\r\nthe least use, and saw them accepted, and even demanded, by those who\r\ncould not dispense with them, though they shunned and ridiculed me the\r\nsame as before. I felt that they sought me only when they needed me;\r\nthis made me shrink still more from their companionship, and, when my\r\nsister did not walk home from school with me, I invariably went alone.\r\n\r\nThe idea that I might not wish to attach myself to playmates of this\r\nsort never occurred to any one, but I was constantly reproached with\r\nhaving no friends among my schoolfellows, and was told that no one\r\ncould love so disagreeable and repelling a child. This was a severe\r\nblow to my affectionate nature, but I bore it calmly, consoling myself\r\nwith the thought that they were wrong, that they did not understand me,\r\nand that the time would come when they would learn that a great, warm\r\nheart was concealed beneath the so-called repulsive exterior.\r\n\r\nBut, however soothing all this was for the time, a feeling of\r\nbitterness grew up within me. I began to be provoked at my ugliness,\r\nwhich I believed to be excessive. I speculated why parents so kind\r\nand good as mine should be deprived of their means of support merely\r\nbecause my father would not consent to endure wrong and imposition.\r\nI was indignant at being told that it was only for my father’s sake\r\nthat I was retained in a school where I tried to do my best and where\r\nI always won the highest prizes; and I could not see why, at home,\r\nI should be forced to do housework when I wanted to read, while my\r\nbrother who wished to work was compelled to study. When I complained of\r\nthis last grievance, I was told that I was a girl and never could learn\r\nmuch, but was only fit to become a housekeeper.\r\n\r\nAll these things threw me upon my own resources and taught me to\r\nmake the most of every opportunity, custom and habit to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nIt was at this juncture that I found, on my return to school, the\r\npsychologic instructor of whom I have spoken, in a newly engaged\r\nteacher of history, geography and arithmetic, all of which were my\r\nfavorite studies.\r\n\r\nWith this man I formed a most peculiar friendship, he being twenty\r\nyears older than myself, and in every respect highly educated; I,\r\na child of twelve, neglected in everything except my common-school\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nHe began by calling my attention to the carelessness of my dress and\r\nthe rudeness of my manners, and was the first one who ever spoke kindly\r\nto me on the subject.\r\n\r\nI told him all my thoughts; that I did not mean to be disagreeable,\r\nbut that every one thought that I could not be otherwise; that I was\r\nconvinced I was good enough at heart; and that I had at last resigned\r\nmyself to my position as something that could not be helped.\r\n\r\nMy new friend lectured me on the necessity of attracting others by an\r\nagreeable exterior and courteous manners, and proved to me that I had\r\nunconsciously repelled them by my carelessness, even when trying the\r\nmost to please. His words made a deep impression on me. I thanked him\r\nfor every reproach, and strove to do my best to gain his approbation.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, my hair was always carefully combed, my dress nicely\r\narranged, and my collar in its place; and as I always won the first\r\nprizes in the school, two of the other teachers soon grew friendly\r\ntowards me and began to manifest their preference quite strongly.\r\n\r\nIn a few months, I became a different being. The bitterness that had\r\nbeen growing up within me gradually disappeared, and I began to have\r\nconfidence in myself and to try to win the companionship of the other\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nBut a sudden change took place in my schoolmates, who grew envious of\r\nthe preference shown me by the teachers. Since they could no longer\r\nridicule me for the carelessness of my dress, they now began to\r\nreproach me for my vanity and to call me a coquette who only thought of\r\npleasing through appearances.\r\n\r\nThis blow was altogether too hard for me to bear. I knew that they\r\nwere wrong, for with all the care I bestowed on my dress, it was not\r\nhalf so fine as theirs, as I had but two calico dresses which I wore\r\nalternately, a week at a time, through the summer. I was again repelled\r\nfrom them; and at noon, when the rest of the scholars went home, I\r\nremained with my teacher-friend in the schoolroom, assisting him in\r\ncorrecting the exercises of the pupils.\r\n\r\nI took the opportunity to tell him of the curious envy that had taken\r\npossession of the girls, upon which he began to explain to me human\r\nnature and its fallacies, drawing inferences therefrom for personal\r\napplication. He found a ready listener in me. My inclination to\r\nabstract thought, combined with the unpleasant experience I had had\r\nin life, made me an attentive pupil and fitted me to comprehend his\r\nreasoning in the broadest sense.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen months, I thus spent the noon hour with him in the\r\nschoolroom, receiving lessons in logic and reasoning upon concrete and\r\nabstract matters that have since proved of far more psychologic value\r\nto me than ten years of reading on the same subjects.\r\n\r\nA strong attachment grew up between us: he became a necessity to me,\r\nand I revered him like an oracle. But his health failed, and he left\r\nthe school at the end of these fifteen months in a consumption.\r\n\r\nShortly after, he sent to the school for me one morning to ask me to\r\nvisit him on his deathbed. I was not permitted to leave the class until\r\nnoon; when, just as I was preparing to go, a messenger came to inform\r\nthe principal that he had died at eleven.\r\n\r\nThis blow fell so heavily upon me that I wished to leave the school at\r\nonce. I was forced to stay three weeks longer, until the end of the\r\nquarter, when I left the schoolroom on the first of April, 1843, at the\r\nage of thirteen years and seven months, and never entered it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n _Training in all details of housework--After mastering them, spends\r\n most of time reading in father’s library--Gradually begins assisting\r\n mother in care of patients--Contact with the heights and depths of\r\n human nature, from dens to palaces--Nurses two aunts and keeps house\r\n for their family--Dr. Arthur Lutze guides her reading in homeopathy\r\n and mesmerism--Attack of “brain fever”--Father burns books from\r\n Dr. Lutze--Marie learns French, plain sewing, dressmaking and the\r\n management of the household, while continuing to assist in mother’s\r\n practice. (Fourteen to eighteen years of age: 1843-1847.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the same day that I quitted my school, an aunt with whom I was a\r\nfavorite was attacked with a violent hemorrhage from the lungs, and\r\nwished me to come to stay with her. This suited my taste. I went, and\r\nfor a fortnight was her sole nurse.\r\n\r\nUpon my return home, my father told me that, having quitted school,\r\nI must now become a thorough housekeeper of whom he might be proud,\r\nas this was the only thing for which girls were intended by nature.\r\nI cheerfully entered upon my new apprenticeship, and learned how to\r\nsweep, to scrub, to wash and to cook. This work answered very well as\r\nlong as the novelty lasted, but as soon as this wore off, it became\r\nhighly burdensome.\r\n\r\nMany a forenoon when I was alone, instead of sweeping and dusting, I\r\npassed the hours in reading books from my father’s library, until\r\nit grew so late that I was afraid that my mother, who had commenced\r\npractice, would come home and scold me for not attending to my work,\r\nwhen I would hurry to get through, doing everything so badly that I had\r\nto hear daily that I was good for nothing and a nuisance in the world;\r\nand that it was not at all surprising that I was not liked in school,\r\nfor nobody could ever like or be satisfied with me.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, my mother’s practice gradually increased, and her generous\r\nand kindly nature won the confidence of hundreds who, wretchedly poor,\r\nfound in her not only a humane woman but a most skillful practitioner.\r\n\r\nThe poor are good judges of professional qualifications. Without the\r\naid that money can buy, without the comforts that the wealthy hardly\r\nneed, and without friends whose advice is prompted by intelligence,\r\nthey must depend entirely upon the skill and humanity of those to whom\r\nthey apply. Their life and happiness are placed in the hands of the\r\nphysician and they jealously regard the one to whom they intrust them.\r\n\r\nNone but a good practitioner can gain fame and praise in this class,\r\nwhich is thought so easily satisfied. It is often said, “Oh! those\r\npeople are poor and will be glad of any assistance.” Far from it! There\r\nis no class so entirely dependent for their subsistence upon their\r\nstrength and health. These constitute their sole capital, their stock\r\nin trade; and when sick, they anxiously seek out the best physicians,\r\nfor, if unskillfully attended, they may lose their all, their fortune\r\nand their happiness.\r\n\r\nMy mother went everywhere, both night and day, and it soon came to pass\r\nthat when she was sent for and was not at home I was deputed to go in\r\nsearch of her. In this way, I gradually became a regular appendage to\r\nmy mother, going with her in the winter nights from place to place and\r\nvisiting those whom she could not visit during the day.\r\n\r\nI remember that in January, 1845, my mother attended thirty-five women\r\nin childbed--the list of names is still in my possession--and visited\r\nfrom sixteen to twenty-five daily, with my assistance. I do not think\r\nthat, during the month, we were in bed for one whole night. Two thirds\r\nof these patients were unable to pay a cent.\r\n\r\nDuring these years, I learned all of life that it was possible for a\r\nhuman being to learn. I saw nobleness in dens, and meanness in palaces;\r\nvirtue among prostitutes, and vice among so-called respectable women.\r\nI learned to judge human nature correctly, to see goodness where the\r\nworld found nothing but faults, and also to see faults where the world\r\ncould see nothing but virtue.\r\n\r\nThe experience thus gained cost me the bloom of youth; yet I would\r\nnot exchange it for a life of everlasting juvenescence. To keep up\r\nappearances is the aim of every one’s life; but to fathom these\r\nappearances and to judge correctly of what is beneath them ought to\r\nbe the aim of those who seek to draw true conclusions from life or to\r\nbenefit others by real sympathy.\r\n\r\nOne fact I learned, both at this time and afterwards, namely, that\r\nmen always sympathize with fallen and wretched women, while women\r\nthemselves are the first to raise and cast the stone at them.\r\n\r\nWhy is this? Have not women as much feeling as men? Why, women are said\r\nto be made up entirely of feeling. How does it happen then that women\r\ncondemn where men pity? Do they do this in the consciousness of their\r\nown superior virtue? Ah, no! for many of the condemning are no better\r\nthan the condemned.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that men know the world, that is, they know the obstacles\r\nin the path of life, and they know that they draw lines to exclude\r\nwomen from earning an honest livelihood while they throw opportunities\r\nin their way to earn their bread by shame. All men are aware of this;\r\ntherefore, the good as well as the bad give pity to those who claim it.\r\n\r\nIt is my honest and earnest conviction that the reason that men are\r\nunwilling for women to enter upon public or business life is not so\r\nmuch the fear of competition or the dread lest women should lose their\r\ngentleness, and thus deprive society of this peculiar charm, as the\r\nfact that they are ashamed of the foulness of life which exists outside\r\nof the house and home. The good man knows that it is difficult to\r\npurify it; the bad man does not wish to be disturbed in his prey upon\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nIf I could but give to all women the tenth part of my experience, they\r\nwould see that this is true, and would see, besides, that only faith in\r\nourselves and in each other is needed to work out a reformation.\r\n\r\nLet woman enter fully into business with its serious responsibilities\r\nand duties; let it be made as honorable and as profitable to her as\r\nto men; let her have an equal opportunity for earning competence and\r\ncomfort--and we shall need no other purification of society. Men are no\r\nmore depraved than women, or rather, the total depravity of mankind is\r\na lie.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of my leaving school until I was fifteen years old, my\r\nlife was passed as I have described, in doing housework, attending\r\nthe sick with my mother, and reading a few books of a scientific and\r\nliterary character. At the end of this time, a letter came from an aunt\r\nof my mother’s, who was ill and whose adopted daughter (who was my\r\nmother’s sister) was also an invalid, requesting me to visit and nurse\r\nthem. I went there in the fall.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the most decisive event of my life. My great-aunt\r\nhad a cancer that was to be taken out. The other was suffering from a\r\nnervous affection which rendered her a confirmed invalid. She was a\r\nmost peculiar woman, and a clairvoyant and somnambulist of the most\r\ndecided kind. Though not ill-natured, she was full of caprices that\r\nwould have exhausted the patience of the most enduring of mortals.\r\n\r\nThis aunt of mine had been sick in bed for seven years with a nervous\r\nderangement which baffled the most skillful physicians who had\r\nvisited her. Her senses were so acute that one morning she fell into\r\nconvulsions from the effect of distant music which she heard. None of\r\nus could perceive it, and we fully believed that her imagination had\r\nproduced this result. But she insisted upon it, telling us that the\r\nmusic was like that of the Bohemian miners who played nothing but\r\npolkas. I was determined to ascertain the truth, and really found that\r\nin a public garden one and a half miles from her house such a troop had\r\nplayed all the afternoon. No public music was permitted in the city\r\nbecause the magistrate had forbidden it on her account.\r\n\r\nShe never was a Spiritualist, though she frequently went into what is\r\nnow called a trance. She spoke, wrote, sang and had presentiments of\r\nthe finest kind while in this condition, far better than I have ever\r\nseen here in America in the case of the most celebrated mediums.\r\n\r\nShe even prescribed for herself with success, yet she was not a\r\nSpiritualist. She was a somnambulist, and, though weak enough when\r\nawake, threatened several times to pull the house down by her violence\r\nwhile in this condition. She had strength like a lion and no man could\r\nmanage her. I saw the same thing in the hospital later.\r\n\r\nThis aunt is now healthy; not cured by her own prescriptions or the\r\nmagnetic or infinitesimal doses of Dr. Arthur Lutze, but by a strong\r\nemotion which took possession of her at the time of my great-aunt’s\r\ndeath. She is not sorry that she has lost all these strange powers, but\r\nheartily glad of it.\r\n\r\nWhen she afterwards visited us in Berlin, she could speak calmly and\r\nquietly of the perversion to which the nervous system may become\r\nsubject if managed wrongly; and she could not tell how glad she was to\r\nbe rid of all the emotions and notions she had been compelled to dream\r\nout. Over-care and over-anxiety had brought this about, and the same\r\ncauses could again bring on a condition which the ancients deemed holy\r\nand which the psychologist treats as one bordering on insanity.\r\n\r\nThe old aunt was extremely suspicious and avaricious. Eight weeks after\r\nmy arrival, she submitted to an operation. The operating surgeon found\r\nme so good an assistant that he intrusted me often with the dressing of\r\nthe wound.\r\n\r\nFor six weeks, I was the sole nurse of the two, going from one room to\r\nthe other both night and day, and attending to the household matters\r\nbesides, with no other assistant than a woman who came every morning\r\nfor an hour or two to do the rough work, while an uncle and a boy\r\ncousin were continually troubling me with their torn buttons, etc.\r\n\r\nI learned in this time to be cheerful and light-hearted under all\r\ncircumstances, going often into the anteroom to have a healthy, hearty\r\nlaugh. My surroundings were certainly anything but inspiring. I had the\r\nsole responsibility of the two sick women--the one annoying me with her\r\ncaprices, the other with her avarice. In one room, I heard fanciful\r\nforebodings; in the other, reproaches for having used a teaspoonful\r\ntoo much sugar. I always had to carry the key of the storeroom to the\r\nold aunt in order that she might be sure that I could not go in and\r\neat bread when I chose. At the end of six weeks she died, and I put on\r\nmourning for the only time in my life, certainly not through grief.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the illness of my aunt I have mentioned Dr. Arthur\r\nLutze. He was a disciple of Hahnemann, and I think a doctor of\r\nphilosophy--certainly not of medicine. Besides being an infinitesimal\r\nhomeopathist, this man was a devotee of mesmerism. He became very\r\nfriendly towards me and supplied me with books, telling me that I would\r\nnot only make a good homeopathic physician but also an excellent medium\r\nfor mesmerism, magnetism, etc.\r\n\r\nAt all events, I was glad to get the books, which I read industriously,\r\nand he constantly supplied me with new ones so that I had quite a\r\nlibrary when he left the place, which he did before my return. He, too,\r\nlived in Berlin, and inquired my residence, promising to visit me there\r\nand to teach me the art he practiced.\r\n\r\nI remained with my aunt until late in the spring, when my health failed\r\nand I returned home. I was very ill for a time with brain fever, but at\r\nlast recovered and set to work industriously to search for information\r\nin respect to the human body.\r\n\r\nDr. Lutze kept his word: he visited me at my home, gave me more\r\nbooks, and directed my course of reading. But my father, who had\r\nbecome reconciled to my inclination to assist my mother, was opposed\r\nto homeopathy and especially opposed to Dr. Arthur Lutze. He even\r\nthreatened to turn him out of the house if I permitted him to visit\r\nme again, and burned all my books except one that I snatched from the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, I was resolved to learn all that I could about the\r\nhuman system. I read all the books that I could get on the subject, and\r\ntried besides to educate myself in other branches.\r\n\r\nMy father was satisfied with this disposition, and was glad to hear me\r\npropose to have a French teacher in the house, both for my sake and for\r\nthat of the other children. I studied in good earnest by myself; at\r\nthe same time, going through the usual discipline of German girls. I\r\nlearned plain sewing, dressmaking and the management of the household,\r\nbut was allowed to use my leisure time as I pleased.\r\n\r\nWhen my sisters went skating, I remained at home to study; when they\r\nwent to balls and theaters, I was thought the proper person to stay\r\nto watch the house. Having become so much older, I was now of great\r\nassistance to my mother in her business. No one complained any longer\r\nof my ugliness or my rudeness. I was always busy, and, when at liberty,\r\nalways glad to do what I could for others; and though these years were\r\nfull of hardships, I consider them among the happiest of my life. I was\r\nas free as it was possible for any German girl to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n _Decides to qualify herself as midwife--Meets great difficulties\r\n due to being unmarried and too young--Studies privately under Dr.\r\n Schmidt--History and organization of the School for Midwives: first\r\n school established through Justina Ditrichin (obstetric surgeon\r\n and writer about 1735); after her death, owing to the opposition\r\n of medical men, educated women withdrew from the profession which\r\n then deteriorated; it became legally standardized in 1818 with\r\n the present school, and women of the higher classes returned\r\n to the profession--Marie being refused for the third time, Dr.\r\n Schmidt obtains an order from the King for her admission to the\r\n school--Becomes assistant teacher under Dr. Schmidt--Receives diploma\r\n of highest degree, and the class which she taught makes the highest\r\n known record. (Eighteen to twenty-two years of age: 1847-1851.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nMy household duties, however, continued distasteful to me, much to\r\nthe annoyance of my father who still contended that this was the only\r\nsphere for woman. From being so much with my mother, I had lost all\r\ntaste for domestic life--anything out of doors was preferable to the\r\nmonotonous routine of the household.\r\n\r\nI at length determined to follow my inclinations by studying, in order\r\nto fit myself to become a practitioner of midwifery, as is usual in\r\nBerlin.\r\n\r\nMy father was satisfied and pleased with this idea, which opened the\r\nway to an independent, respectable livelihood, for he never really\r\nwished to have us seek this in marriage.\r\n\r\nMy mother did not like my resolution at all. She practiced, not because\r\nshe liked the profession, but because in this way she obtained the\r\nmeans of being independent and of aiding in the education of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nI persisted, however, in my resolution, and immediately took measures\r\nto carry it into effect by going directly to Dr. Joseph Hermann\r\nSchmidt, the Professor of Midwifery in the University and the School\r\nfor Midwives, and Director of the Royal Hospital Charité; while my\r\nfather, who for several years held the position of a civil officer,\r\nmade the application to the city magistrates for me to be admitted as a\r\npupil to the School for Midwives, in which my mother had been educated.\r\n\r\nIn order to show the importance of this step, it is necessary to\r\nexplain more fully the history and organization of the school.\r\n\r\nAbout 1735, Justina Ditrichin (the wife of Siegemund, a distinguished\r\ncivil officer of Prussia) was afflicted with an internal disease which\r\nbaffled the skill of the midwives, who had pronounced her pregnant, and\r\nnone of whom could define her disorder. After many months of suffering,\r\nshe was visited by the wife of a poor soldier, who told her what ailed\r\nher; in consequence of which, she was cured by her physicians.\r\n\r\nThis circumstance awakened in the mind of the lady an intense desire\r\nto study midwifery, which she did; and afterwards practiced it with\r\nsuch success that, in consequence of her extensive practice, she was\r\nobliged to confine herself solely to irregular cases. She performed all\r\nkinds of operations with masterly skill and wrote the first book on the\r\nsubject ever published in Germany by a woman. She was sent for from all\r\nparts of Germany, and was appointed body-physician to the Queen and\r\nladies of the court of Prussia and Mark Brandenburg.\r\n\r\nThrough her influence, schools were established in which women were\r\ninstructed in the science and the art of obstetrics. She also taught\r\nmany herself, and a very successful and respectable practice soon grew\r\nup among women. After her death, however, this was discountenanced by\r\nthe physicians, who brought it into such disrepute by their ridicule\r\nthat the educated class of women withdrew from the profession. This\r\nleft it in the hands of ignorant pretenders who continued to practice\r\nit until 1818. At this time, public attention was called to the subject\r\nand strict laws were enacted by which women were required to call in a\r\nmale practitioner in every irregular case of confinement, under penalty\r\nof from one to twenty years of imprisonment and the forfeiture of the\r\nright to practice.\r\n\r\nThese laws still continue in force. A remarkable case is recorded by\r\nDr. Schmidt of a woman who, feeling her own competence to manage a case\r\ncommitted to her care, _did not_ send for a male physician as the\r\nlaw required. Although it was fully proved that she had done everything\r\nthat could have been done in the case, her penalty was imprisonment\r\nfor twenty years. Two other cases are quoted by Dr. Schmidt, in which\r\nmale practitioners were summoned before a legal tribunal. It was proved\r\nthat they _had not_ done that which was necessary, yet their\r\npenalty was no heavier than that inflicted on the woman who had done\r\nexactly what she ought.\r\n\r\nAt this time (1818), it was also made illegal for any woman to practice\r\nwho had not been educated. This brought the profession again into\r\nrepute among women of the higher classes. A school for midwives,\r\nsupported by the government, was established in Berlin, in which women\r\nhave since continued to be educated for practice in this city and\r\nin other parts of Prussia. Two midwives are elected each year, by a\r\ncommittee, from the applicants, to be educated for practice in Berlin.\r\nAnd as they have to study two years, there are always four of these\r\nstudents in the school, two graduating every year. The remainder of the\r\nstudents are from the provincial districts.\r\n\r\nTo be admitted to this school is considered a stroke of good fortune,\r\nas there are generally more than a hundred applicants, many of whom\r\nhave to wait eight or ten years before they are elected. There is,\r\nbesides, a great deal of favoritism, those women being generally chosen\r\nwho are the widows or wives of civil officers or physicians, to whom\r\nthis chance of earning a livelihood is given in order that they may\r\nnot become a burden on the government. Though educated apart from the\r\nmale students while studying the theory of midwifery, they attend\r\nthe accouchement ward together, and receive clinical or practical\r\ninstruction in the same class from the same professor.\r\n\r\nThe male students of medicine are admitted to the university at the age\r\nof eighteen, having first been required to go through a prescribed\r\ncourse of collegiate study and to pass the requisite examination.\r\nHere they attend the lectures of various professors, often of four\r\nor five upon the same subject, in order to learn how it is treated\r\nfrom different points of view. Then, after having thus studied for a\r\ncertain length of time, they present themselves for an examination by\r\nthe professors of the university, which confers upon them the title of\r\n_M.D._, without the right to practice. They are then obliged to\r\nprepare for what is called the State’s examination, before a Board of\r\nthe most distinguished men in the profession appointed to this place\r\nby the government; these also constitute the medical court. Of this\r\nnumber, Dr. Schmidt was one.\r\n\r\nDr. Schmidt approved my resolution and expressed himself warmly in\r\nfavor of it. He also recommended to me a course of reading, to be\r\ncommenced at once as a kind of preliminary education. And although he\r\nhad no influence with the committee of the city government who examined\r\nand elected the pupils, he promised to call upon some of them and urge\r\nmy election. But despite his recommendation and my father’s position as\r\ncivil officer, I received a refusal, on the grounds that I was much too\r\nyoung (being only eighteen) and that I was unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe latter fault I did not try to remove; the former I corrected daily;\r\nand when I was nineteen, I repeated my application and received the\r\nsame reply.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, Dr. Schmidt became more and more interested in me\r\npersonally. He promised that he would do all in his power to have me\r\nchosen the next year and urged me to read and study as much as possible\r\nin order to become fully acquainted with the subject.\r\n\r\nAs usual, I continued to assist my mother in visiting her patients,\r\nand thus had a fine opportunity for explaining to myself many things\r\nwhich the mere study of books left in darkness. In fact, these years\r\nof preliminary practical study were more valuable to me than all\r\nthe lectures that I ever listened to afterwards. Full of zeal and\r\nenthusiasm and stimulated by a friend whose position and personal\r\nacquirements inspired me with reverence and devotion, I thought of\r\nnothing else than how to prepare myself in such a way that I should not\r\ndisappoint him nor those to whom he had commended me.\r\n\r\nDr. Schmidt was consumptive and almost an invalid, often having to\r\nlecture in a reclining position. The author of many valuable medical\r\nworks and director of the largest hospital in Prussia (the Charité of\r\nBerlin), he found a most valuable assistant in his wife--one of the\r\nnoblest women that ever lived. She was always with him except in the\r\nlecture room, and almost all of his works are said to have been written\r\nby her from his dictation.\r\n\r\nThis had inspired him with the highest possible respect for women.\r\nHe had the utmost faith in their powers when rightly developed, and\r\nalways declared their intellectual capacity to be the same with that of\r\nmen. This belief inspired him with the desire to give me an education\r\nsuperior to that of the common midwives; and at the same time, to\r\nreform the school of midwives by giving to it a professor of its own\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nTo this position he had in his own mind already elected me. But before\r\nI could take it, I had to procure a legitimate election from the city\r\nto the school as pupil, and during my attendance, he had to convince\r\nthe government of the necessity of such a reform, as well as to bring\r\nover the medical profession. This last was not so easily done, for many\r\nmen were already waiting for Dr. Schmidt’s death in order to obtain\r\nthis very post which was considered valuable.\r\n\r\nWhen I was twenty, I received my third refusal. Dr. Schmidt, whose\r\nhealth was failing rapidly, had exerted himself greatly to secure my\r\nadmission. The medical part of the committee had promised him that\r\nthey would give me their vote, but some theological influence was set\r\nto work to elect one of the deaconesses in my stead, so that she might\r\nbe educated for the post of superintendent of the lying-in ward of the\r\nhospital which was under Dr. Schmidt’s care. She also was rejected in\r\norder not to offend Dr. Schmidt, but for this he would not thank them.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had I carried him the letter of refusal than he ordered his\r\ncarriage and, proceeding to the royal palace, obtained an audience with\r\nthe king, to whom he related the refusal of the committee to elect me\r\non the ground that I was too young and unmarried, and entreated of him\r\na cabinet order which should compel the city to admit me to the school,\r\nadding that he saw no reason why Germany as well as France should not\r\nhave and be proud of a Lachapelle.\r\n\r\nThe king, who held Dr. Schmidt in high esteem, gave him at once the\r\ndesired order, and I became legally the student of my friend. His\r\npraise, however, procured me intense vexation, for my name was dropped\r\nentirely and I was only spoken of as Lachapelle the Second, which\r\nwould by no means have been unpleasant had I earned the title, but to\r\nreceive it sneeringly in advance before having been allowed to make my\r\nappearance publicly, was indeed unbearable.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after his visit to the king, Dr. Schmidt received me\r\ninto the class and introduced me to it as his future assistant teacher.\r\nThis announcement was as surprising to me as to the class, but I took\r\nit quietly, thinking that if Dr. Schmidt did not consider me fit for\r\nthe place, he would not risk being attacked for it by the profession\r\n_en masse_, by whom he was watched closely.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, a little incident occurred which I must mention.\r\nIn the evening, instead of going alone to the class for practical\r\ninstruction, I accompanied Dr. Schmidt at his request. We entered the\r\nhall where his assistant, the chief physician, had already commenced\r\nhis instructions. Dr. Schmidt introduced me to him as his private pupil\r\nto whom he wished him to give particular attention, ending by giving\r\nmy name. The physician hurriedly came up to me and grasped my hand,\r\nexclaiming, “Why, this is my little blind doctor!” I looked at him and\r\nrecognized the very Dr. Müller with whom I used to make the rounds of\r\nthe hospital when I was twelve years old, and who had since risen to\r\nthe position of chief physician. This _rencontre_ and the interest\r\nthat he manifested afterwards greatly relieved Dr. Schmidt who had\r\nfeared that he would oppose me instead of giving me any special aid.\r\n\r\nDuring this winter’s study, I spent the most of the time in the\r\nhospital, being almost constantly at the side of Dr. Schmidt. I\r\ncertainly made the most of every opportunity, and I scarcely believe\r\nit possible for any student to learn more in so short a time than I\r\ndid during this winter. I was continually busy, acting even as nurse\r\nwhenever I could learn anything by it. During the following summer, I\r\nwas obliged to reside wholly in the hospital, this being a part of the\r\nprescribed education. Here I became acquainted with all the different\r\nwards and had a fine opportunity to watch the cases by myself.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Dr. Schmidt’s illness increased so rapidly that he\r\nfeared he might die before his plans in respect to me had been carried\r\nout, especially as the state of his health had compelled him to give up\r\nhis position as Chief Director of the Hospital Charité. His intention\r\nwas to make me chief accoucheuse in the hospital, and to surrender into\r\nmy hands his position as professor in the School for Midwives, so that\r\nI might have the entire charge of the midwives’ education.\r\n\r\nThe opposition to this plan was twofold. First, the theological\r\ninfluence that sought to place the deaconess (Sister Catherine) in\r\nthe position of house-midwife; and, second, the younger part of the\r\nprofession, many of whom were anxious for the post of professor in the\r\nSchool for Midwives, which never would have been suffered to fall into\r\nthe hands of Sister Catherine. Dr. Schmidt, however, was determined\r\nto yield to neither. Personal pride demanded that he should succeed\r\nin his plan, and several of the older and more influential members of\r\nthe profession took his part, among whom were Johannes Müller, Busch,\r\nMüller, Kilian, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the second winter, his lecturing in the class was only nominal,\r\noften nothing more than naming the heads of the subjects while I had\r\nto give the real instruction. His idea was to make me feel the full\r\nresponsibility of such a position, and at the same time to give me a\r\nchance to do the work that he had declared me preëminently capable of\r\ndoing. This was an intrigue, but he would not have it otherwise. He\r\ndid not intend that I should perform his duty for his benefit, but for\r\nmy own. He wished to show to the government the fact that I had done\r\nthe work of a man like himself and had done it well; and that, if he\r\nhad not told them of his withdrawal, no one would have recognized his\r\nabsence from the result.\r\n\r\nAt the close of this term, I was obliged to pass my examination at\r\nthe same time with the fifty-six students who composed the class. Dr.\r\nSchmidt invited some of the most prominent medical men to be present,\r\nbesides those appointed as the examining committee. He informed me of\r\nthis on the day before the examination, saying, “I want to convince\r\nthem that you can do better than half of the young men at _their_\r\nexamination.”\r\n\r\nThe excitement of this day I can hardly describe. I had not only to\r\nappear before a body of strangers of whose manner of questioning I had\r\nno idea, but also before half a dozen authorities in the profession,\r\nassembled especially for criticism.\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself my position: standing before the table at which\r\nwere seated the three physicians composing the examining committee, who\r\nquestioned in the most perplexing manner, while four other physicians\r\nof the highest standing were seated on each side, making eleven in\r\nall; Dr. Schmidt, a little way off, anxious that I should prove true\r\nall that he had said in praise of me, and the rest of the class in the\r\nbackground, filling up the large hall. It was terrible. The trifling\r\nhonor of being considered capable was rather dearly purchased.\r\n\r\nI went through the whole hour bravely, without missing a single\r\nquestion, until finally the clock struck twelve, when everything\r\nsuddenly grew black before my eyes, and the last question sounded like\r\na humming noise in my ear. I answered it--how, I know not--and was\r\npermitted to sit down and rest for fifteen minutes before I was called\r\nto the practical examination on the manikin. I gave satisfaction to\r\nall, and received the diploma of the first degree.\r\n\r\nThis by no means ended the excitement. The students of the year were\r\nnext examined. This examination continued for a week, after which the\r\ndiplomas were announced, when it was found that never before had there\r\nbeen so many of the first degree and so few of the third. Dr. Schmidt\r\nthen made it known that this was the result of my exertions, and I was\r\npronounced _a very capable woman_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n _Dr. Schmidt urges Marie’s appointment as Chief of the\r\n School, including the surrender to her of his own position as\r\n professor--Violent medical and diplomatic opposition, becoming a\r\n controversy over “Woman’s Rights”--Marie’s father refuses his consent\r\n and insists that she marry a man she has never even seen--Eventually,\r\n Dr. Schmidt wins and Marie receives her appointment--Triumph\r\n immediately turned to tragedy by sudden death of Dr. Schmidt on the\r\n same day. (Twenty-two years of age: 1851-1852.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe acknowledgment that I was a very capable woman having been made\r\nby the medical men present at the examination, Dr. Schmidt thought\r\nit would be an easy matter to get me installed into the position for\r\nwhich I had proved myself capable. But such could not be the case\r\nin a government ruled by hypocrisy and intrigue. To acknowledge the\r\ncapability of a woman did not by any means say that she was at liberty\r\nto hold a position in which she could exercise this capability.\r\n\r\nGerman men are educated to be slaves to the government: positive\r\nfreedom is comprehended only by a few. They generally struggle for a\r\nkind of negative freedom, namely, for themselves. For each man, however\r\nmuch he may be inclined to show his subserviency to those superior\r\nin rank, thinks himself the lord of creation and, of course, regards\r\nwoman only as his appendage. How can this lord of creation, being a\r\nslave himself, look upon the _free development_ and _demand for\r\nrecognition_ of his appendage otherwise than as a nonsense or a\r\nusurpation of his exclusive rights?\r\n\r\nAnd among these lords of creation, I heartily dislike that class which\r\nnot only yield to the influence brought to bear upon them by the\r\ngovernment but who also possess an infinite amount of narrowness and\r\nvanity united to an infinite servility to money and position. There is\r\nnot ink and paper enough in all the world to write down the contempt I\r\nfeel for men in whose power it is to be free in thought and noble in\r\naction, and who yet act to the contrary to feed their ambition or their\r\npurses. I have learned, perhaps, too much of their spirit for my own\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nYou can hardly believe what I experienced in respect to intrigue within\r\nthe few months following my examination. All the members of the medical\r\nprofession were unwilling that a woman should take her place on a level\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nAll the diplomatists became fearful that Dr. Schmidt intended to\r\nadvocate the question of “Woman’s Rights”; one of them exclaiming one\r\nevening, in the heat of discussion, “For Heaven’s sake! the Berlin\r\nwomen are already wiser than all the men of Prussia: what will become\r\nof us if we allow them to manifest it?”\r\n\r\nI was almost forgotten in the five months during which the question was\r\ndebated: it became more than a matter of personal intrigue. The real\r\nquestion at stake was, “How shall women be educated, and what is their\r\ntrue sphere?” And this was discussed with more energy and spirit than\r\never has been done here in America.\r\n\r\nScores of letters were written by Dr. Schmidt to convince the\r\ngovernment that a woman could really be competent to hold the position\r\nin question, and that I had been pronounced so by the whole faculty.\r\n\r\nThe next objection raised was that my father was known as holding\r\nrevolutionary principles; and to conquer this cost a long discussion,\r\nwith many interviews of the officials with my father and Dr. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nThe next thing urged was that I was much _too young_; that it\r\nwould be necessary, in the course of my duties, to instruct the young\r\nmen also, and that there was danger in our thus being thrown together.\r\nIn fact, this reason, read to me by Dr. Schmidt from one of the letters\r\nwritten at this time (all of which are still carefully preserved), runs\r\nthus, “To give this position to Miss M. E. Zakrzewska is dangerous. She\r\nis a prepossessing young lady, and from coming in contact with so many\r\ngentlemen must necessarily fall in love with some one of them, and thus\r\nend her career.” To this, I have only to reply that I am sorry that\r\nI could not have found _one_ among them that could have made me\r\nfollow the suggestion.\r\n\r\nThis objection, however, seemed for a while the most difficult to be\r\nmet, for it was well known that, when a student myself, I had stood\r\non the most friendly terms with my fellow students. And that they had\r\noften taken my part in little disturbances that naturally came up in an\r\nestablishment where no one was permitted to enter or to leave without\r\ngiving a reason. Even my private patients were sometimes sent away at\r\nthe door because I did not know of their coming and for this reason\r\ncould not announce to the doorkeeper the name and residence of those\r\nwho might possibly call.\r\n\r\nThat this difficulty was finally conquered, I have to thank the\r\nstudents themselves. My relation with these young men was of the\r\npleasantest kind. They never seemed to think that I was not of their\r\nsex, but always treated me like one of themselves. I knew of their\r\nstudies and their amusements; yes, even of the mischievous pranks\r\nthat they were planning both for college and for social life. They\r\noften made me their confidante in their private affairs, and were\r\nmore anxious for my approval or forgiveness than for that of their\r\nrelatives. I learned during this time how great is the friendly\r\ninfluence of a woman even upon fast-living and licentious young men;\r\nand this has done more to convince me of the necessity that the two\r\nsexes should live together from infancy, than all the theories and\r\narguments that are brought to convince the mass of this fact.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became known among the students that my youth was the new\r\nobjection, they treated it in such a manner that the whole thing was\r\ntransformed into a ridiculous bugbear, growing out of the imagination\r\nof the _virtuous_ opposers.\r\n\r\nNothing now seemed left in the way of my attaining to the position,\r\nwhen suddenly it dawned upon the mind of some that I was irreligious,\r\nthat neither my father nor my mother attended church, and that, under\r\nsuch circumstances, I could not of course be a church-goer.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I had complied with the requirements of the law, and\r\ncould therefore bring my certificate of confirmation from one of the\r\nProtestant churches. By the advice of Dr. Schmidt, I commenced to\r\nattend church regularly, and continued until a little incident happened\r\nwhich I must relate here.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday, just after the sermon was over, I remembered that I had\r\nforgotten to give instructions to the nurse in respect to a patient and\r\nI left the church without waiting for the end of the service. The next\r\nmorning, I was summoned to answer to the charge of leaving the church\r\nat an improper time. The inquisitor (who was one of those who had\r\naccused me of irreligion), being vexed that I contradicted him by going\r\nto church regularly, was anxious to make me confess that I did not care\r\nfor the service. But I saw through his policy as well as his hypocrisy,\r\nand simply told him the truth, namely, that I had forgotten important\r\nbusiness and therefore thought it excusable to leave as soon as the\r\nsermon was over.\r\n\r\nWhether he sought to lure me on to further avowals, I know not; but\r\nwhatever was his motive, he asked me in reply whether I believed that\r\nhe cared for the humdrum custom of church-going, and whether I thought\r\nhim imbecile enough to consider this as anything more than the means by\r\nwhich to keep the masses in check, adding that it was the duty of the\r\nintelligent to make the affair respectable by setting the example of\r\ngoing themselves, and that he only wished me to act on this principle,\r\nwhen all accusations of irreligion would fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nI had always known that this man was not my friend, but when I heard\r\nthis, I felt disenchanted with the whole world. I had never thought\r\nhim more than a hypocrite, whereas I now found him the meanest of men\r\nboth in theory and in practice. I was thoroughly indignant, the more\r\nso, since I felt guilty myself in going to church simply to please Dr.\r\nSchmidt.\r\n\r\nI do not remember what answer I gave, but I know that my manners and\r\nwords made it evident that I considered him a villain. He never forgave\r\nme for this, as all his future acts proved to me. For, in his position\r\nof chief director of the hospital, he had it in his power, more than\r\nany one else, to annoy me, and that he did so you will presently see.\r\n\r\nThe constant opposition and attendant excitement, together with the\r\nannoyances which my father, as civil officer, had to endure, made him\r\nresolve to present a declaration to the government that I should never,\r\nwith his consent, enter the position. He had become so tired of my\r\nefforts to become a public character in my profession that he suddenly\r\nconceived the wish to have me married.\r\n\r\nNow, take for a moment into consideration the facts that I was but\r\ntwenty-two years of age, full of sanguine enthusiasm for my vocation,\r\nand strong in the friendship of Dr. Schmidt. He had inspired me with\r\nthe idea of a career different from the common routine of domestic life.\r\n\r\nMy mother, overcoming her repugnance to my entering my profession, had\r\nbeen my best friend, encouraging me steadily; while my father, yielding\r\nto the troubles that it involved, had become disgusted with it, and\r\nwished me to abandon my career. He was stern, and would not take back\r\nhis word. I could do nothing without his consent; while Dr. Schmidt had\r\nfinally overcome all difficulties and had the prospect of victory if my\r\nfather would but yield.\r\n\r\nA few weeks of this life were sufficient to drive one mad, and I am\r\nsure that I was near becoming so. I was resolved to run away from home\r\nor to kill myself, while my father was equally resolved to marry me to\r\na man whom I had never seen.\r\n\r\nMatters finally came to a crisis through the illness of Dr. Schmidt,\r\nwhose health failed so rapidly that it was thought dangerous to let him\r\nbe longer excited by the fear of not realizing his favorite scheme.\r\nSome of his medical advisers influenced the government to appeal to my\r\nfather to withdraw his declaration, which, satisfied with the honor\r\nthus done him, he did on the 1st of May, 1852.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th of May, I received my legal installment to the position\r\nfor which Dr. Schmidt had designed me. The joy that I felt was great\r\nbeyond expression. A youthful enthusiast of twenty-two, I stood at the\r\nheight of my wishes and expectations. I had obtained what others could\r\nobtain only after the protracted labor of half a lifetime, and already\r\nI saw myself in imagination occupying the place of Dr. Schmidt’s\r\naspirations--that of a German _Lachapelle_.\r\n\r\nNo one who has not passed at the same age through the same excitement\r\ncan comprehend the fullness of my rejoicing, which was not wholly\r\nselfish, for I knew that nothing in the world would please Dr. Schmidt\r\nso much as this victory. The wildest joy of an accepted suitor is a\r\nfarce compared to my feelings on the morning of that 15th of May. I\r\nwas reconciled to my bitterest opponents, I could even have thanked\r\nthem for their opposition, since it had made the success so much the\r\nsweeter.\r\n\r\nNot the slightest feeling of triumph was in my heart; all was happiness\r\nand rejoicing. And it was in this condition of mind and heart that\r\nI put on my bonnet and shawl to carry the good news to Dr. Schmidt.\r\nWithout waiting to be announced, I hastened to his parlor, where I\r\nfound him sitting with his wife upon the sofa. I did not walk, but\r\nflew, towards them and threw the letter upon the table, exclaiming,\r\n“There is the victory!”\r\n\r\nLike a conflagration, my joy spread to Dr. Schmidt as well as to his\r\nwife, who thought that she saw in these tidings a cup of new life for\r\nher husband. I stayed only long enough to accept their congratulations.\r\nDr. Schmidt told me to be sure to come the next morning to enter\r\nlegally upon my duties at his side. He saw that I needed the open air,\r\nand felt that he too must have it to counteract his joy. I went to tell\r\nmy father and several friends, and spent the day in blissful ignorance\r\nof the dreadful event that was transpiring.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at seven o’clock, I left home to go to my residence in\r\nthe hospital. I had not slept during the night; the youthful fire of\r\nenthusiasm burnt too violently to allow me any rest.\r\n\r\nThe old doorkeeper opened the door for me, and gazed at me with an air\r\nof surprise. “What is the matter?” I asked. “I am astonished to see you\r\nso cheerful,” said he. “Why?” I asked with astonishment. “Don’t you\r\nknow that Dr. Schmidt is dead?” was the answer. Dr. Schmidt dead! I\r\ntrembled; I staggered; I fell upon a chair.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful entrance hall, serving also as a greenhouse during the\r\nwinter, filled in every place with flowers and tropical fruit, faded\r\nfrom my eyes; and in its stead I saw nothing but laughing faces,\r\ndistorted with scorn and mockery.\r\n\r\nA flood of tears cooled the heat of my brain, and a calmness like that\r\nof death soon took possession of me. I had fallen from the topmost\r\nheight of joy and happiness to the profoundest depth of disappointment\r\nand despair. If there was nothing else to prove the strength of my\r\nmind, the endurance of this sudden change would be sufficient.\r\n\r\nI went at once to Dr. Schmidt’s residence in the Hospital Park, where I\r\nmet him again, not as I had expected an hour before ready to go with me\r\nto the hospital department which I was henceforth to superintend, but\r\nas a corpse.\r\n\r\nAfter I had left the day before, he had expressed a wish to go into the\r\nopen air, his excitement nearly equaling mine. Mrs. Schmidt ordered the\r\ncarriage, and they drove to the large park. He talked constantly and\r\nexcitedly about the satisfaction he felt in this success until they\r\narrived, when he wished to get out of the carriage and walk with his\r\nwife. Mrs. Schmidt consented, but they had taken only a few steps when\r\nhe sank to the ground, and a gush of blood from his mouth terminated\r\nhis existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n _Death of Dr. Schmidt opens doors for hosts of office-seekers and\r\n for Marie’s opponents--Hostilities of latter nullified by her methods,\r\n and by her continued professional success with patients and with both\r\n men and women students--After six months’ struggle with unabated\r\n animosities and intrigue, she resigns her position in the hospital.\r\n (Twenty-three years of age: 1852.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI left Dr. Schmidt’s house, and entered alone into the wards, where\r\nI felt that I was without friendly encouragement and support. During\r\nthe three days that intervened before the burial of Dr. Schmidt, I was\r\nhardly conscious of anything, but moved about mechanically like an\r\nautomaton.\r\n\r\nThe next few days were days of confusion, for the death of Dr. Schmidt\r\nhad left so many places vacant that some fifty persons were struggling\r\nto obtain some one of his offices. The eagerness, servility and\r\nmeanness which these educated men displayed in striving to conquer\r\ntheir rivals was more than disgusting. The serpents that lie in wait\r\nfor their prey are endurable, for we know that it is their nature to\r\nbe cunning and relentless; but to see men of intellect and education\r\nsly and snaky, ferocious yet servile to the utmost, makes one almost\r\nbelieve in total depravity. The most of these men got what they\r\ndeserved, namely, nothing. The places were filled temporarily with\r\nothers, and everything went on apparently as before.\r\n\r\nMy position soon became very disagreeable. I had received my\r\ninstallment, not because I was wanted by the directors of the hospital,\r\nbut because they had been commanded by the government to accept me, in\r\nthe hope of thus prolonging the life of Dr. Schmidt.\r\n\r\nYoung and inexperienced in petty intrigue, I had now to work without\r\nfriendly encouragement and appreciation, in an establishment where\r\nthree thousand people were constantly at war about each other’s\r\naffairs; with no one about me in whom I had a special interest, while\r\nevery one was regretting that the installment had been given me before\r\nDr. Schmidt’s death which might have happened just as well from some\r\nother excitement. I surveyed the whole arena, and saw very well that,\r\nunless I practiced meanness and dishonesty as well as the rest, I could\r\nnot remain there for any length of time, for scores were ready to\r\ncalumniate me whenever there was the least thing to be gained by it.\r\n\r\nI was about to commence a new period of life. I had a solid structure\r\nas a foundation, but the superstructure had been built up in so short a\r\ntime that a change of wind would suffice to cast it down. I resolved,\r\ntherefore, to tear it down myself and to begin to build another upon\r\nthe carefully laid basis. I waited only for an opportunity to manifest\r\nmy intention. This opportunity soon presented itself.\r\n\r\nSister Catherine, the deaconess of whom I have spoken, who had been\r\nallowed to attend the School for Midwives after my election, through\r\nthe influence of her theological friends upon Dr. Schmidt (the city\r\nmagistrates having refused her because I was already the third accepted\r\npupil), had as yet no position. These friends now sought to make her\r\nthe _second accoucheuse_, I having the first position, with the\r\nadditional title of Chief.\r\n\r\nThis she would not accept. She, the experienced deaconess, who had been\r\na Florence Nightingale in the typhus epidemic of Silesia, was unwilling\r\nto be under the supervision of a woman who had nothing to show but\r\na thorough education, and who was besides eight years younger than\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nHer refusal made my enemies still more hostile. Why they were so\r\nanxious for her services I can only explain by supposing that the\r\ndirectors of the hospital wished to annoy Pastor Fliedner, the\r\noriginator of the Kaiserswerth Sisterhood. For, in placing Sister\r\nCatherine in this position, they robbed him of one of the very best\r\nnurses that he had ever had in his institution.\r\n\r\nMy desire to reconcile the government of the hospital, in order that I\r\nmight have peace in my position to pursue my development and education\r\nso as to realize and manifest to the people the truth of what Dr.\r\nSchmidt had affirmed of me, induced me to go to one of the directors\r\nand propose that Sister Catherine should be installed on equal terms\r\nwith me, offering to drop the title of Chief and to consent that the\r\ndepartment should be divided into two.\r\n\r\nMy proposition was accepted nominally, and Sister Catherine was\r\ninstalled but with a third less salary than I received, while I had\r\nto give the daily reports, etc., and to take the chief responsibility\r\nof the whole. Catherine was quite friendly to me, and I was happy\r\nin the thought that there was now one at least who would stand by me\r\nshould any difficulties occur. How much I was mistaken in the human\r\nheart! This pious, sedate woman, towards whom my heart yearned with\r\nfriendship, was my greatest enemy, though I did not know it until after\r\nmy arrival in America.\r\n\r\nA few weeks afterwards, the city petitioned to have a number of\r\nwomen instructed in the practice of midwifery. These women were all\r\nexperienced nurses who had taken the liberty to practice this art to a\r\ngreater or less extent from what they had learned of it while nursing;\r\nand to put an end to this unlawful practice, they had been summoned\r\nbefore an examining committee, and the youngest and best educated\r\nwere chosen to be instructed as the law required. Dr. Müller, the\r\npathologist, was appointed to superintend the theoretical, and Dr.\r\nEbert, the practical, instruction. Dr. Müller, who never had given\r\nthis kind of instruction before, and who was a special friend of mine,\r\nimmediately surrendered the whole into my hands; while Dr. Ebert, whose\r\ntime was almost wholly absorbed in the department of the diseases\r\nof children, appointed me as his assistant. Both gentlemen gave me\r\ncertificates of this when I determined to emigrate to America.\r\n\r\nThe marked preference for my wards that had always been shown by\r\nthe male students was shared by these women when they came. Sister\r\nCatherine was neither ambitious nor envious, yet she felt that she was\r\nthe second in place. Drs. Müller and Ebert never addressed themselves\r\nto her; neither did they impress the nurses and the servants with the\r\nidea that she was anything more than the head nurse. All these things\r\ntogether made her a spy; and though nothing happened for which I could\r\nbe reproved, all that I said and did was watched and secretly reported.\r\n\r\nUnder a despotic government, the spy is as necessary as the corporal.\r\nThe annoyance of this reporting is that the secrecy exists only for the\r\none whom it concerns, while the subaltern officers and servants receive\r\nhints that such a person is kept under constant surveillance.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that no occasion offered to find fault with me, our\r\nadministrative inspector was removed and a surly old corporal put in\r\nhis place, with the hint that the government of the hospital thought\r\nthat the former inspector did not perform his duty rightly, since he\r\nnever reported disturbance in a ward that had formerly been notorious\r\nas being the most disorderly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Marie’s method in transforming this ward and consequently its\r\nreputation is evidently described in the “Introduction” written by Mrs.\r\nDall for these earlier chapters.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1856, Marie was addressing a physiological institute\r\nin Boston. Mrs. Dall says:\r\n\r\n She spoke to them of her experience in the hospital at Berlin, and\r\n showed that the most sinning, suffering woman never passed beyond the\r\n reach of a woman’s sympathy and help.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dall then quotes from the address:\r\n\r\n Soon after I entered the hospital [said Marie], the nurses called\r\n me to a ward where sixteen of the most forlorn objects had begun to\r\n fight with each other. The inspector and the young physician had been\r\n called to them, but dared not enter the _mêlée_. When I arrived,\r\n pillows, chairs, footstools and vessels had deserted their usual\r\n places; and one stout little woman, with rolling eyes and tangled\r\n hair, had lifted a vessel of slops which she threatened to throw all\r\n over me, as she exclaimed, “Don’t dare to come here, you green young\r\n thing!”\r\n\r\n I went quietly towards her, saying gently, “Be ashamed, my dear woman,\r\n of your fury.”\r\n\r\n Her hands dropped. Seizing me by the shoulder, she exclaimed, “You\r\n don’t mean that you look on me as a woman?”\r\n\r\n “How else?” I answered. She retreated to her bed while all the rest\r\n stood in the attitudes into which passion had thrown them.\r\n\r\n “Arrange your beds,” I said; “and in fifteen minutes, let me return\r\n and find everything right.” When I returned, all was as I had desired,\r\n every woman standing at her bedside. The short woman was missing, but\r\n bending on each a friendly glance I passed through the ward, which\r\n never gave me any more trouble.\r\n\r\n When, late at night, I entered my room, it was fragrant with violets.\r\n A green wreath surrounded an old Bible and a little bouquet rested on\r\n it. I did not pause to speculate over this sentimentality, but threw\r\n myself weary upon the bed when a light tap at the door startled me.\r\n The short woman entered and humbling herself on the floor, since she\r\n would not sit in my presence, entreated to be heard.\r\n\r\n “You called me a woman,” she said, “and you pity us. Others call us by\r\n the name the world gives us. You would help us, if help were possible.\r\n All the girls love you and are ashamed before you; and therefore\r\n _I_ hated you--no: I will not hate you any longer. There was a\r\n time when I might have been saved--I, and Joanna, and Margaret, and\r\n Louise. We were not bad. Listen to me. If _you_ say there is any\r\n hope, I will yet be an honest woman.”\r\n\r\n She had had respectable parents; and, when twenty years old, was\r\n deserted by her lover who left her three months pregnant. Otherwise\r\n kind, her family perpetually reproached her with her disgrace and\r\n threatened to send her away. At last, she fled to Berlin, keeping\r\n herself from utter starvation by needlework. In the hospital to which\r\n she went for confinement, she took the smallpox. When she came out,\r\n with her baby in her arms, her face was covered with red blotches.\r\n Not even the lowest refuge was open to her, her appearance was so\r\n frightful. With her baby dragging at her empty breast, she wandered\r\n through the streets. An old hag took pity on both, and carefully\r\n nursed till health returned, her good humor and native wit made those\r\n about her forget her ugly face. She was in a brothel, where she soon\r\n took the lead. Her child died, and she once more attempted to earn\r\n her living as a seamstress. She was saved from starvation only by her\r\n employer, who received her as his mistress. Now her luck changed. She\r\n suffered all that a woman could, handled poison and the firebrand.\r\n “I thought of stealing,” she said, “only as an amusement; it was not\r\n exciting enough for a trade.” She found herself in prison, and was\r\n amused to be punished for a trifle, when nobody suspected her crime.\r\n It was horrible to listen to these details; more horrible to witness\r\n her first repentance.\r\n\r\n When I thanked her for her violets, she kissed my hands, and promised\r\n to be good.\r\n\r\n While she remained in the hospital, I took her as my servant and\r\n trusted everything to her, and when finally discharged she went out to\r\n service. She wished to come with me to America. I could not bring her,\r\n but she followed, and when I was in Cleveland, inquired for me in New\r\n York.]\r\n\r\nThe truth was that in my innocence of heart I had been striving to\r\ngain the respect and friendship of my enemies by doing my work better\r\nthan any before me had done. To go to bed at night regularly was a\r\nthing unknown to me. Once, I was not undressed for twenty-one days\r\nand nights; superintending and giving instructions on six or eight\r\nconfinement cases in every twenty-four hours; lecturing three hours\r\nevery afternoon to the class of midwives; giving clinical lectures to\r\nthem twice a week for an hour in the morning; superintending the case\r\nof some twenty infants who were epidemically attacked with purulent\r\nophthalmia; and having, besides, the general supervision of the whole\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nBut all this could not overcome the hostility of my enemies, the chief\r\ncause of which lay in the mortification at having been vanquished by my\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I was happy in the thought that Mrs. Schmidt\r\ncontinued to take the same interest in me as before, and was glad to\r\nhear of my partial success. The students, both male and female, were\r\ndevoted to me, and manifested their gratitude openly and frankly. This\r\nwas the greatest compensation that I received for my work.\r\n\r\nThe women wished to show their appreciation by paying me for the extra\r\nlabor that I performed in their instruction, not knowing the fact that\r\nI did it simply in order that they might pass an examination which\r\nshould again convince the committee that I was in the right place.\r\nI forbade all payment as I had refused it to the male students when\r\nthey wished to pay me for their extra instruction on the manikin. But\r\nin a true womanly way, they managed to learn the date of my birthday,\r\nwhen two or three, instead of attending the lecture, took possession\r\nof my room which they decorated with flowers, while on the table they\r\ndisplayed presents to the amount of some hundred and twenty dollars\r\nwhich the fifty-six women of the class had collected among themselves.\r\n\r\nThis was, of course, a great surprise to me and really made me feel\r\nsad, for I did not wish for things of this sort. I wished to prove that\r\nunselfishness was the real motive of my work, and thought that I should\r\nfinally earn the crown of appreciation from my enemies for which I was\r\nstriving. This gift crossed all my plans. I must accept it, if I would\r\nnot wound the kindest of hearts, yet I felt that I lost my game by so\r\ndoing. I quietly packed everything into a basket and put it out of\r\nsight under the bed, in order that I might not be reminded of my loss.\r\n\r\nOf course, all these things were at once reported. I saw in the faces\r\nof many that something was in agitation, and I waited a fortnight in\r\nconstant expectation of its coming. But these people wished to crush\r\nme entirely. They knew well that a blow comes hardest when least\r\nexpected, and they therefore kept quiet week after week until I really\r\nbegan to ask their pardon in my heart for having done them the wrong to\r\nexpect them to act meanly about a thing that was natural and allowable.\r\n\r\nIn a word, I became quiet and happy again in the performance of my\r\nduties; then suddenly, six weeks after my birthday, I was summoned to\r\nthe presence of Director Horn (the same who had reprimanded me for\r\nleaving the church). He received me with a face as hard and stern as an\r\navenging judge, and asked me whether I knew that it was against the law\r\nto receive any other payment than that given me by the hospital. Upon\r\nmy avowing that I did, he went on to ask how it was then that I had\r\naccepted gifts on my birthday.\r\n\r\nThis question fell upon me like a thunderbolt, for I had never thought\r\nof looking upon these as a payment. If these women had paid me for the\r\ninstruction that I gave them beyond that which was prescribed, they\r\nought each one to have given me the value of the presents. I told him\r\nthis in reply and also how disagreeable the acceptance had been to me\r\nand how ready I was to return the whole at his command, since it had\r\nbeen my desire to prove not only my capability but my unselfishness in\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nThe man was ashamed--I saw it in his face as he turned it away from me;\r\nyet he saw in me a proof that he had been vanquished in intrigue, and\r\nhe was resolved that the occasion should end in my overthrow.\r\n\r\nMuch more was said about the presents and their significance, and I\r\nsoon ceased to be the humble woman and spoke boldly what I thought, in\r\ndefiance of his authority, as I had done at the time of the religious\r\nconversation (by the way, I never attended church again after that\r\ninterview).\r\n\r\nThe end was that I declared my readiness to leave the hospital.\r\n\r\nHe wished to inflict direct punishment on me and forbade me to be\r\npresent at the examination of the class which was to take place the\r\nnext day. This was really a hard penalty to which he was forced for\r\nhis own sake. For if I had been present, I should have told the whole\r\naffair to men of a nobler stamp who would have opposed, as they\r\nafterwards did, my leaving a place which I filled to their entire\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n _She begins private practice--Mrs. Schmidt and many physicians plan\r\n to establish a Maternity Hospital for her--Her father renews his\r\n insistence that she should marry--Recollections of a report of the\r\n Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia, and\r\n of Dr. Schmidt’s comment on it, turn her thoughts to America, and\r\n she decides to emigrate--She receives official acknowledgment of her\r\n work at the Hospital, together with a gift of money--Accompanied by a\r\n younger sister, she arrives in New York. (Twenty-four years of age:\r\n 1852-1853.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI made my preparations to leave the hospital on the 15th of November,\r\n1852. What was I to do? I was not made to practice quietly, as is\r\ncommonly done; my education and aspirations demanded more than this.\r\nFor the time, I could do nothing more than inform my patients that I\r\nintended to practice independently.\r\n\r\nMy father again wished that I should marry, and I began to ask\r\nmyself whether marriage is an institution to relieve parents from\r\nembarrassment. When troubled about the future of a son, parents are\r\nready to give him to the army; when in fears of the destiny of a\r\ndaughter, they induce her to become the slave of the marriage bond.\r\nI never doubted that it was more unendurable and unworthy to be a\r\nwife without love than a soldier without a special calling for that\r\nprofession, and I never could think of marriage as the means to\r\nprocure a shelter and bread. I had so many schemes in my head that I\r\nwould not listen to his words. Among these was especially the wish to\r\nemigrate to America.\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Female Medical College had sent its first report to\r\nDr. Schmidt, who had informed me as well as his colleagues of it and\r\nhad advocated the justice of such a reform. It was in March, 1852, that\r\nhe spoke of this, saying to those present, “In America, women will now\r\nbecome physicians, like the men; this shows that only in a republic can\r\nit be proved that science has no sex.”\r\n\r\nThis fact recurred to my memory, and I decided to go to America to\r\njoin in a work open to womanhood on a larger scale; and for the next\r\ntwo months, I did nothing but speculate how to carry out my design of\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\nI had lived rather expensively and lavishly, without thinking of laying\r\nup any money; and my whole fortune, when I left the Charité, consisted\r\nof sixty dollars.\r\n\r\nOne thing happened in connection with my leaving the hospital which I\r\nmust relate here. Director Horn was required to justify his conduct to\r\nthe minister to whom the change had to be reported, and a committee was\r\nappointed to hear the accusation and to pass judgment upon the affair.\r\nAs this was done in secrecy and not before a jury, and as the accuser\r\nwas a man of high rank, I knew nothing of it until Christmas Eve when I\r\nreceived a document stating that, “as a gratification for my services\r\nfor the benefit of the city of Berlin” in instructing the class of\r\nmidwives, a compensation was decreed me of fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nThis was a large sum for Berlin, such as was given only on rare\r\noccasions. I was also informed that Director Horn was instructed to\r\ngive me, should I ever demand it, a first-class certificate of what my\r\nposition had been in the hospital, with the title of Chief attached.\r\n\r\nFor whatever I had suffered from the injustice of my enemies, I was\r\nnow fully recompensed. I inquired who had taken my part so earnestly\r\nagainst Director Horn as to gain this action, and found that it was Dr.\r\nMüller the pathologist, backed by several other physicians. Director\r\nHorn, it was said, was greatly humiliated by the decision of Minister\r\nvon Raumer, who could not see the least justice in his conduct in this\r\nmatter, and had I not left the hospital so readily, I should never have\r\nstood so firmly as after this secret trial.\r\n\r\nIt was done, however, and I confidently told my mother of my design to\r\nemigrate. Between my mother and myself there existed not merely the\r\nstrongest relation of maternal and filial love, but also a professional\r\nsympathy and peculiar friendship, which was the result of two similar\r\nminds and hearts, and which made me stand even nearer to her than as a\r\nchild I possibly could have done. She consented with heart and soul,\r\nencouraged me in all my plans and expectations, and asked me at once at\r\nwhat time I would leave.\r\n\r\nI next told my father and the rest of the family of my plan. My third\r\nsister (Anna), a beautiful, joyous young girl, exclaimed, “And I will\r\ngo with you!” My father, who would not listen to my going alone,\r\nat once consented to our going together. But I thought differently.\r\nIn going alone, I risked only my own happiness; in going with her,\r\nI risked hers too, while I should be constantly restricted in my\r\nadventurous undertakings by having her, who knew nothing of the world\r\nsave the happiness of a tranquil family life, with me.\r\n\r\nThe next day I told them that I had changed my mind and should not go\r\naway, but should establish myself in Berlin. Of course, I received\r\na torrent of gibes on my fickleness, for they did not understand my\r\nfeelings in respect to the responsibility that I feared to take for my\r\nyounger sister.\r\n\r\nI began to establish myself in practice. Mrs. Schmidt, who was anxious\r\nto assist me in my new career, suggested to those physicians who were\r\nmy friends the establishment of a private hospital which should be\r\nunder my care. She found them strongly in favor of the plan, and had I\r\nnot been constantly speculating about leaving for America, this scheme\r\nwould have been realized.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Schmidt’s words after reading the first report of the\r\nPhiladelphia Female Medical College recurred to me again and again. I\r\nhad resolved to emigrate, and I took my measures accordingly. I went\r\nsecretly to Drs. Müller and Ebert and procured certificates attesting\r\nmy position in respect to them in the hospital. I then obtained the\r\ncertificate from Director Horn, and I carried them all to the American\r\nChargé d’Affaires (Theodore S. Fay) to have them legalized in English,\r\nso that they would be of service to me in America.[2]\r\n\r\nWhen I told Drs. Ebert and Müller and Mrs. Schmidt of my intention to\r\nemigrate, they pronounced me insane. They thought that I had the best\r\nfield of activity open in Berlin and could not comprehend why I should\r\nseek greater freedom of person and of action.\r\n\r\nLittle really is known in Berlin about America, and to go there is\r\nconsidered as great an undertaking as to seek the river Styx in order\r\nto go to Hades. The remark that I heard from almost every quarter was,\r\n“What! you wish to go to the land of barbarism, where they have negro\r\nslavery and where they do not know how to appreciate talent and genius?”\r\n\r\nBut this could not prevent me from realizing my plans. I had idealized\r\nthe freedom of America and especially the reform of the position of\r\nwomen, to such an extent that I would not listen to their arguments.\r\nAfter having been several years in America, very probably I would think\r\ntwice before undertaking again to emigrate, for even the idealized\r\nfreedom has lost a great deal of its charm when I consider how much\r\nbetter it could be.\r\n\r\nHaving put everything in order, I told my father of my conclusion to\r\nleave. He was surprised to hear of it the second time, but I showed him\r\nmy papers in readiness for the journey and declared that I should go\r\nas soon as the ship was ready to sail, having a hundred dollars, just\r\nmoney enough to pay my passage.\r\n\r\nHe would not give his consent unless my sister Anna accompanied me,\r\nthinking her, I suppose, a counterpoise to any rash undertakings in\r\nwhich I might engage in a foreign land. If I wished to go, therefore,\r\nI was forced to have her company, of which I should have been very glad\r\nhad I not feared the moral care and responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe decided to go in a fortnight. My father paid her passage and gave\r\nher a hundred dollars in cash, just enough to enable us to spend a\r\nshort time in New York, after which he expected either to send us more\r\nmoney or that we would return; and, in case we did this, an agreement\r\nwas made with the shipping merchant that payment should be made on our\r\narrival in Hamburg.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of March, 1853, we left the paternal roof, to which we\r\nshould never return. My mother bade us adieu with tears in her eyes,\r\nsaying, “_Au revoir_ in America!” She was determined to follow us.\r\n\r\nHere ends my Berlin and European life, and I can assure you that this\r\nwas the hardest moment I ever knew. Upon my memory is forever imprinted\r\nthe street, the house, the window behind which my mother stood waving\r\nher handkerchief. Not a tear did I suffer to mount to my eyes in order\r\nto make her believe that the departure was an easy one, but a heart\r\nbeating convulsively within punished me for the restraint.\r\n\r\nMy father and brothers accompanied us to the depot, where the cars\r\nreceived us for Hamburg. On our arrival there, we found that the ice\r\nhad not left the Elbe and that the ship could not sail until the river\r\nwas entirely free. So we were forced to remain three weeks in Hamburg.\r\n\r\nWe had taken staterooms in the clipper ship _Deutschland_. Besides\r\nourselves, there were sixteen passengers in the first cabin, people\r\ngood enough in their way, but not sufficiently attractive to induce us\r\nto make their acquaintance. We observed a dead silence as to who we\r\nwere, where we were going, or what was the motive of our emigrating\r\nto America. The only person that we ever spoke to was a Mr. R. from\r\nHamburg, a youth of nineteen, who like ourselves had left a happy home\r\nin order to try his strength in a strange land.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was of forty-seven days’ duration, excessively stormy but\r\notherwise very dull, like all voyages of this kind, and had it not\r\nbeen for the expectations that filled our hearts, we should have died\r\nof _ennui_. As it was, the days passed slowly, made worse by the\r\ninevitable seasickness of our fellow-passengers, and we longed for the\r\nhour that should bring us in sight of the shores of the New World.\r\n\r\nAnd now commences my life in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n _First impressions of New York--Marie takes walk alone the next\r\n day--Experience with a white slave agent--Confronted with her\r\n ignorance of the English language, she postpones proceeding to\r\n Philadelphia--Begins housekeeping in a small apartment with her\r\n sister Anna--Astounded by hearing that “female physicians” have no\r\n professional standing in New York, she puts out a sign and seeks\r\n private practice, as she did in Berlin--While waiting for patients,\r\n she builds up a business in making fancy worsted goods, Anna works for\r\n a dressmaker, and they soon become self-supporting. (Twenty-four years\r\n of age: 1853.)_\r\n\r\n\r\n“Dear Marie, best Marie! make haste to come up on deck to see America!\r\nOh, how pleasant it is to see the green trees again! How brightly the\r\nsun is gilding the land you are seeking--the land of freedom!”\r\n\r\nWith such childlike exclamations of delight, my sister Anna burst\r\ninto my cabin to hasten my appearance on deck on the morning of the\r\n22nd of May, 1853. The beautiful child of nineteen summers was only\r\nconscious of a heart overflowing with pleasure at the sight of the\r\ncharming landscape that opened before her eyes after a tedious voyage\r\nof forty-seven days upon the ocean.\r\n\r\nWe had reached the quarantine at Staten Island. The captain, the old\r\npilot, every one, gazed at her as she danced joyously about the deck,\r\nwith a mingled feeling of sadness and curiosity, for our reserve while\r\non shipboard had surrounded us with a sort of mystery which none knew\r\nhow to unravel.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I had dressed for going on shore and had packed up the\r\nthings that we had used on our voyage in order that they might not be\r\nstolen during this time of excitement, I obeyed the last call of my\r\nimpatient sister to come at least to see the last rays of sunrise and\r\nwent on deck, where I was at once riveted by the beautiful scene that\r\nwas spread before my eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm, glorious day. And the green sloping lawns with which\r\nthe white cottages formed such a cheerful contrast; the trees clad in\r\ntheir first foliage, and suggesting hope by their smiling blossoms; the\r\nplacid cows feeding quietly in the fields; the domestic chickens just\r\nvisible in the distance; and the friendly barking of a dog--all seemed\r\nto greet me with a first welcome to the shores of this strange country;\r\nwhile the sun shining brightly from an azure sky strewn with soft white\r\nclouds mellowed the whole landscape, and so deeply impressed my soul\r\nthat tears sprang to my eyes and a feeling rose in my heart that I can\r\ncall nothing else than devotional, for it bowed my knees beneath me and\r\nforced sounds from my lips that I could not translate into words for\r\nthey were mysterious to myself.\r\n\r\nA stranger in a strange wide land, not knowing its habits and customs,\r\nnot understanding its people, nor its workings and aims, yet my mind\r\nwas not clouded with loneliness. I was happy. Had it not been my own\r\nwish that had made me leave the home of a kind father and of a mother\r\nbeloved beyond all earthly beings. I had succeeded in safely reaching\r\nthe shores of America. Life was again open before me.\r\n\r\nWith these thoughts, I turned from the beautiful landscape and finding\r\nthe captain, a noble-hearted sailor, inquired of him how long it\r\nwould take us to reach the port of New York. “That is New York,” said\r\nhe, pointing to a dark mass of buildings with here and there a spire\r\ntowering in the air. “We shall reach there about eight o’clock, but it\r\nis Sunday and you will have to stay on board till to-morrow.” With this\r\nhe turned away, calling his men to weigh anchor, as the physician whose\r\nduty it was to inspect the cargo of men, like cattle, had just left in\r\nhis boat.\r\n\r\nOn we went, my sister still dancing and singing for joy; and Mr. R.\r\nand myself sitting somewhat apart, he looking despondently into the\r\nwater, and I with my head firmly raised in the air, happy in heart, but\r\nthoughtful in mind and trusting in my inward strength for the future.\r\n\r\nI took my breakfast on deck. No one seemed to have any appetite, and I\r\nfelt somewhat reproved when I heard some one near me say, “She seems to\r\nhave neither head nor heart--see how tranquilly she can eat at such a\r\ntime as this!” These words were spoken by one of the cabin passengers,\r\na young man who was exceedingly curious to know why I was going to\r\nAmerica and had several times tried to make the rest of the passengers\r\nbelieve that it must be in consequence of an unhappy love. The poor\r\nsimpleton! he thought that women could enter into life only through the\r\ntragedy of a broken heart.\r\n\r\nA bell sounded. We were opposite Trinity Church whose bell had just\r\ntolled eight. On our right were masses of brick houses and tall\r\nchimneys surrounded by a forest of masts; on our left were the romantic\r\nshores of New Jersey. Islands and projecting points of land, clad in\r\nthe brilliant green of the fresh spring foliage, greeted the eye;\r\nferryboats, like monstrous white swans, glided to and fro from the\r\nshores; rowboats plied everywhere, the white or red shirts of the\r\noarsmen giving a bright touch of color to the ever-changing panorama.\r\nSuch was the scene which gave us our first impressions of this new\r\ncountry, seeming to proclaim as its welcome freedom and hospitality to\r\nall newcomers.\r\n\r\nThis new civilization was utterly different from what we had been\r\ntaught about the United States. Indeed, I think many of the passengers\r\nexpected to see a _half-civilized_ community who, under a rather\r\nanarchical state of government called a “republic,” did just as\r\neach individual pleased, and who would greet every newcomer with an\r\nenthusiastic joy, inviting him to come and partake of all the good the\r\ncountry could offer.\r\n\r\nSuch, or similar, were the vague ideas which many passengers of the\r\ngood ship _Deutschland_ entertained no matter whether in the cabin\r\nor steerage. The captain had done his best to rectify these false\r\nexpectations but with very little success, I am sure.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the picture that unrolled itself as we approached slowly\r\nfrom the quarantine to the dock, while arousing the old enthusiasm\r\nthat started the emigrants from their homes, brought also a kind of\r\ndisappointment--a surprise to see a well-built and well-regulated\r\n“brick-house” city with all the accessories of a large commercial port;\r\na city, in fact, to all appearances not very much unlike European\r\ncities. But the admiration with which I had gazed upon Staten Island\r\nwas gone as I stood before this beautiful scene; the appreciation of\r\nnature was mastered by another feeling, a feeling of activity that had\r\nbecome my ideal.\r\n\r\nI had come here for a purpose--to carry out the plan which a despotic\r\ngovernment and its servile agents had prevented me from doing in\r\nmy native city. I had to show to those men who had opposed me so\r\nstrongly because I was a woman that, in this land of liberty, equality\r\nand fraternity, I could maintain that position which they would not\r\npermit to me at home. My talents were in an unusual direction. I was a\r\nphysician, and, as such, had for years moved in the most select circles\r\nof Berlin. Even my enemies had been forced to give me the highest\r\ntestimonials, and these were the only treasure that I brought to this\r\ncountry, for I had given my last dollar to the sailor who brought me\r\nthe first news that land was in sight.\r\n\r\nI looked again upon New York, but with a feeling that a great mystery\r\nwas lying before my eyes--a feeling that was confirmed by the men who\r\ncame off to the ship in small boats speaking a language that seemed\r\nlike a chaos of sounds.\r\n\r\nThen, though standing before the promised land of freedom and in spite\r\nof all youthful enthusiasm and vigor, a sadness overcame me, especially\r\none which bordered very closely on homesickness, even before my foot\r\nhad been once more planted on _terra firma_.\r\n\r\nAs I turned, I saw my sister coming slowly up from the cabin with a\r\nchanged air; and I asked her with surprise what was the matter. “O\r\nMarie!” said she, “most of the passengers are called for. Mr. R.’s\r\nbrother has just come to take him on shore. He was so glad to see him\r\n(for he thought he was in New Orleans), that I think he will forget to\r\nsay good-by. I am afraid that we shall have to stay here all alone,\r\nand----” “Are the Misses Zakrzewska on board?” called a voice from a\r\nlittle boat by the side of the ship. We looked down in surprise but\r\ndid not recognize the man, who spoke as if he were an acquaintance.\r\nThe captain answered, “Yes.” Upon which the same voice said, “Mr. G.\r\nrequests them to wait; he will be here in a moment.”\r\n\r\nThis announcement surprised us the more that it came from a totally\r\nunexpected quarter. An acquaintance of ours, who had emigrated to New\r\nYork a few years before and had shortly after married a Mr. G. had\r\nheard from her brother in Berlin of our departure for America in the\r\nship _Deutschland_, and these good people, thinking that they\r\ncould be of use to us in a new country, had been watching for its\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nNo one on board dared ask a question as to who our friends were, so\r\nreserved had we been in regard to our plans. Only the young man who\r\nhad accused me of having neither head nor heart said, half aside, “Ah\r\nha! Now we know the reason why Miss Marie ate her breakfast so calmly,\r\nwhile her sister danced for joy. They had beaus who were expecting\r\nthem.” “Simpleton!” thought I, “must women always have beaus in order\r\nto be calm about the future?”\r\n\r\nMr. G. came on board in a few minutes, bringing us from his wife an\r\ninvitation of welcome to her house. I cannot express in words the\r\nemotion awakened in my heart by the really unselfish kindness that\r\nhad impelled these people to greet us in this manner; and this was\r\nincreased when we reached their very modest dwelling, consisting of a\r\nlarge shop in which Mr. G. carried on his business of manufacturing\r\nfringes and tassels, one sitting room, a bedroom and a small kitchen.\r\nMy strength left me, and my composure dissolved in a flood of tears.\r\nThe good people did all that they could to make us feel at home, and\r\ninsisted that we should occupy the sitting room until we had decided\r\nwhat to do further. Of course, I determined that this should be for as\r\nshort a time as possible, and that we would immediately look out for\r\nother lodgings. But for the moment, nothing but pleasure was in our\r\nhearts. Questions and answers concerning friends and relations at home\r\nfilled every minute, and joy and thankfulness to be safe and sound on\r\nland quickened the heart beats.\r\n\r\nOne-half of this first day was spent in talking about home; the other,\r\nin making an excursion to Hoboken. This visit we would gladly have\r\ndispensed with, so exhausted were we by the excitement that we had\r\npassed through since sunrise, but our friends were bent on entertaining\r\nus with stories and sights of the New World, and we followed them\r\nrather reluctantly. I have since been glad that I did so, for my mind\r\nwas in a state that rendered it far more impressible than usual and\r\ntherefore better fitted to observe much that would have been lost to me\r\nin a less-excited condition.\r\n\r\nHere I first saw the type of common German life on Sunday in America,\r\nand I saw enough of it on that one Sunday afternoon to last a whole\r\nlifetime. My friends called on several of their acquaintances.\r\nEverywhere that we went, I noticed two peculiarities--comparative\r\npoverty in the surroundings and apparent extravagance in the manner of\r\nliving. For in every house we found an abundance of wine, beer, cake,\r\nmeat, salad, etc., although it was between the hours of meals; and\r\nevery one was eating, although no one seemed hungry. At nine o’clock in\r\nthe evening, the visit was concluded by going to a hotel, where a rich\r\nsupper was served up to us; and at eleven at night we returned home.\r\n\r\nMy work in America had already commenced. Was it not necessary for a\r\nstranger in a new country to observe life in all its phases before\r\nentering upon it? It seemed so to me, and I had already planned while\r\non shipboard to spend the first month in observations of this kind.\r\nI had made a fair beginning, and when I saw many repetitions of this\r\nkind of life among my countrymen, I feared that this was their main\r\npurpose in this country and their consolation for the loss of the\r\nentertainments and recreations which their fatherland offered to them.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I got opportunity to make my observations among the\r\neducated classes, I found my fear ungrounded; and I also found that the\r\nAmericans had noticed the impulse for progress and higher development\r\nwhich animated these Germans. The German mind, so much honored in\r\nEurope for its scientific capacity, for its consistency regarding\r\nprinciples and for its correct criticism, is not dead here. But it has\r\nto struggle against difficulties too numerous to be detailed here,\r\nand therefore it is that the Americans do not know of its existence,\r\nand the chief obstacle is their different languages. A Humboldt must\r\nremain unknown here unless he chooses to Americanize himself in every\r\nrespect--and could he do this without ceasing to be Humboldt, the\r\ncosmopolitan genius?\r\n\r\nIt would be a great benefit to the development of this country if\r\nthe German language were made a branch of education and not simply\r\nan accomplishment. Only then would the Americans appreciate how much\r\nhas been done by the Germans to advance higher development and to\r\ndiffuse the true principles of freedom. It would serve both parties\r\nto learn how much the Germans aid in developing the reason and in\r\nsupporting progress in every direction. The revolution of 1848 has been\r\nmore serviceable to America than to Germany, for it has caused the\r\nemigration of thousands of men who would have been the pride of a free\r\nGermany. America has received the German freemen, whilst Germany has\r\nretained the _subjects_.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, I determined to return to the ship to look after my\r\nbaggage. As Mr. and Mrs. G. were busy in their shop, there was no one\r\nto accompany me. I therefore had either to wait until they were at\r\nleisure or to go alone. I chose the latter, and took my first walk in\r\nthe city of New York on my way to the North River where the ship was\r\nlying. The noise and bustle everywhere about me absorbed my attention\r\nto such a degree that instead of turning to the right, I went to the\r\nleft and found myself at the East River, in the neighborhood of Peck\r\nSlip. Here I inquired after the German ship _Deutschland_ and was\r\ndirected, in my native tongue, down to the Battery and thence up to\r\nPier 13, where I found the ship discharging the rest of her passengers\r\nand their baggage. It was eleven o’clock when I reached the ship; I\r\nhad, therefore, taken a three hours’ walk. I had now to wait until the\r\ncustom-house officer had inspected my trunk, and afterwards for the\r\narrival of Mr. G., who came at one o’clock with a cart to convey the\r\nbaggage to his house.\r\n\r\nWhile standing amidst the crowd, a man in a light suit of clothes of no\r\npositive color and with a complexion of the same sort, came up to me\r\nand asked in German whether I had yet found a boarding-place. The man’s\r\nsmooth face instinctively repelled me, yet the feeling that I was not\r\nindependently established made me somewhat indefinite in my reply. On\r\nseeing this, he at once grew talkative and friendly and speaking of the\r\nnecessity of finding a safe and comfortable home, said that he could\r\nrecommend me to a hotel where I would be treated honestly; or that, if\r\nI chose to be in a private family, he knew of a very kind, motherly\r\nlady who kept a boarding house for ladies alone, not to make money but\r\nfor the sake of her countrywomen.\r\n\r\nThe familiarity that he mingled in his conversation while trying to\r\nbe friendly made me thoroughly indignant. I turned my back upon him,\r\nsaying that I did not need his services.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before I saw him besieging my sister Anna, who had come\r\nwith Mr. G., being nervous lest I might not have found the ship. What\r\nhe said to her, I do not know. I only remember that she came to me,\r\nsaying, “I am afraid of that man; I wish that we could go home soon.”\r\n\r\nThis meeting with a man who makes friendly offers of service may seem\r\na small matter to the mere looker-on, but it ceases to be so when\r\none knows his motives. And since that time, I have had but too many\r\nopportunities to see for what end these offers are made.\r\n\r\nMany an educated girl comes from the Old World to find a position as\r\ngoverness or teacher who is taken up in this manner and is never heard\r\nfrom again or is found only in the most wretched condition. It is\r\nshameful that the most effective arrangements should not be made for\r\nthe safety of these helpless beings who come to these shores with the\r\nhope of finding a Canaan.\r\n\r\nTo talk with our friends about the future and the cause of my arrival\r\nin New York became now a necessity. So I related how the information\r\nof 1852, concerning a medical school for women, in Philadelphia, had\r\ninspired me to offer my assistance as a practical instructor and to\r\nassist in organizing a hospital.\r\n\r\nMy good friends not only showed dismay in face and manner as I\r\nproceeded, but they expressed it in words, telling me that they\r\nhad never heard of any “female physicians” except those of a very\r\ndisreputable character who advertised in all newspapers and carried on\r\ncriminal practices.\r\n\r\nConfronted with my ignorance of the English language, as I now realized\r\nmyself, I postponed starting for the medical school in Philadelphia,\r\nand, having letters of introduction to well-stationed people in New\r\nYork, I decided to settle in a two-room home of my own as soon as this\r\ncould be found, we having concluded to commence housekeeping on a small\r\nscale in order to be more independent and to save money.\r\n\r\nThe week was mostly spent in looking for apartments. On our arrival,\r\nI had borrowed from my sister the hundred dollars which my father had\r\ngiven her on our departure from Berlin and which was to be my capital\r\nuntil I had established myself in business. I succeeded in finding\r\na suite of rooms with windows facing the street, in the house of a\r\ngrocer; and having put them in perfect order, we moved into them on\r\nthe sixth of June, paying eleven dollars as our rent for two months in\r\nadvance.\r\n\r\nMy sister took charge of our first day’s housekeeping, while I went\r\nto deliver my letters of introduction. I went first to Dr. Reisig, in\r\nFourteenth Street. My mother, who had employed him when he was a young\r\nman and we were small children, had spoken of him kindly, and for this\r\nreason I had confidence in him. I found him a very friendly man, but by\r\nno means a cordial one.\r\n\r\nHe informed me that female physicians in this country were of the\r\nlowest rank and that they did not hold even the position of a good\r\nnurse. He said that he wished to be of service to me if I were willing\r\nto serve as nurse, and as he was just then in need of a good one, he\r\nwould recommend me for the position. I thanked him for his candor\r\nand kindness, but refused his offer as I could not condescend to be\r\npatronized in this way.\r\n\r\nDepressed in hope but strengthened in will, I did not deliver any\r\nmore of my letters, since they were all to physicians and I could not\r\nhope to be more successful in other quarters. I went home, therefore,\r\ndetermined to commence practice as a stranger.\r\n\r\nThe result of my experiment discouraged my sister greatly. After\r\nmeditating for some time, she suddenly said, “Marie, I read in the\r\npaper this morning of a dressmaker who wanted some one to sew for her.\r\nI know how to sew well; I shall go there, and you can attend to our\r\nlittle household. No one here knows me, and I do not think there is\r\nanything wrong in my trying to earn some money.”\r\n\r\nShe was determined, and went. I put up my sign, and spent my time in\r\nattending to the household duties and in reading in order to gain\r\ninformation of the country and of the people. Occasionally I took walks\r\nthrough different parts of the city to learn from the houses and their\r\nsurroundings the character of life in New York. I am sure that, though\r\nperhaps I appeared idle, I was not so in reality, for during this time\r\nI learned the philosophy of American life.\r\n\r\nBut our stock of money was becoming less and less. To furnish the rooms\r\nhad cost us comparatively little as we had brought a complete set of\r\nhousehold furniture with us, but paying the rent and completing the\r\narrangements had not left us more than enough to live upon, in the most\r\neconomical manner, until the first of August.\r\n\r\nMy sister obtained the place at the dressmaker’s; and after working\r\na week from seven in the morning until twelve (when she came home to\r\ndinner), then from one in the afternoon until seven in the evening,\r\nshe received two dollars and seventy-five cents as the best sewer of\r\nsix. She brought home the hard-earned money with tears in her eyes, for\r\nshe had expected at least three dollars for the week’s work. She had\r\nmade each day a whole muslin dress, with the trimmings. And this was\r\nnot all--the dressmaker often did not pay on Saturday nights, because,\r\nas she said, people did not pay her punctually, and the poor girls\r\nreceived their wages by six or eight shillings at a time. For the last\r\ntwo weeks of my sister’s work, she received her payment seven weeks\r\nafter she had left.\r\n\r\nWe lived in this manner until the middle of July, when I lost patience,\r\nfor practice did not come as readily as I wished nor was I in a\r\nposition for making money in any other way. My sister, usually so\r\ncheerful and happy, grew grave from the unusual work and the close\r\nconfinement. One of these nights on lying down to sleep, she burst into\r\ntears and told me of her doubts and fears for the future. I soothed her\r\nas well as I could, and she fell asleep. For myself, I could not sleep\r\nbut lay awake all night meditating what I could possibly do. Should I\r\nwrite home, requesting help from my father? He certainly would have\r\ngiven it, for two weeks before we had received a letter offering us\r\nall desirable aid. No! All my pride rebelled against it. “I must help\r\nmyself,” I thought, “and that to-morrow.”\r\n\r\nThe next morning my sister left me as usual. I went out and walked\r\nthrough the city to Broadway, turning into Canal Street, where I had\r\nformed an acquaintance with a very friendly German woman by purchasing\r\nlittle articles at various times at her store. I entered without any\r\nparticular design and exchanged a few commonplaces with her about the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nHer husband stood talking with a man about worsted goods, and their\r\nconversation caught my ear. The merchant was complaining because\r\nthe manufacturer did not supply him fast enough, upon which the man\r\nanswered that it was very difficult to get good hands to work and that\r\nbesides he had more orders than it was possible to fill, naming several\r\nmerchants whose names I had seen in Broadway who were also complaining\r\nbecause he did not supply them.\r\n\r\nAfter he had left, I asked carelessly what kind of articles were in\r\ndemand and was shown a great variety of worsted fancy goods. A thought\r\nentered my brain. I left the store and, walking down Broadway, asked\r\nat one of the stores that had been mentioned for a certain article of\r\nworsted goods in order to learn the price. Finding this enormous, I\r\ndid not buy it, and I returned home, calculating on my way how much it\r\nwould cost to manufacture these articles and how much profit could be\r\nmade in making them on a large scale. I found that two hundred per cent\r\nprofit might be made by going to work in the right way.\r\n\r\nMy sister came home as usual to dinner. I sat down with her, but could\r\nnot eat. She looked at me anxiously, and said, “I hope you are not sick\r\nagain. Oh, dear! What shall we do if you get sick?” I had been ill\r\nfor a week and she feared a relapse. I said nothing of my plan, but\r\nconsoled her in respect to my health.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she had left, I counted my money. But five dollars remained.\r\nIf I had been dependent upon money for cheerfulness, I should certainly\r\nhave been discouraged. I went to John Street and entering a large\r\nworsted store, inquired of a cheerful-looking girl the wholesale price\r\nof the best Berlin wool, how many colors could be had in a pound, etc.\r\nThe pleasant and ready answers that I received in my native tongue\r\ninduced me to tell her frankly that I wanted but a small quantity at\r\nthat time, that I intended to make an experiment in manufacturing\r\nworsted articles; and if successful, I would like to open a small\r\ncredit, which she said they generally would do when security was given.\r\n\r\nI purchased four and a half dollars’ worth of worsted, so that fifty\r\ncents were left in my pocket when I quitted the store. I then went to\r\nthe office of a German newspaper, where I paid twenty-five cents for\r\nadvertising for girls who understood all kinds of knitting.\r\n\r\nWhen my sister came home at night, the worsted was all sorted on the\r\ntable in parcels for the girls who would come the next morning, while I\r\nwas busily engaged in the experiment of making little worsted tassels.\r\nI had never been skillful in knitting, but in this I succeeded so well\r\nthat I could have made a hundred yards of tassels in one day.\r\n\r\nMy sister turned pale on seeing all this, and hurriedly asked, “How\r\nmuch money have you spent?” “All, my dear Anna,” answered I, “all,\r\nexcept twenty-five cents, which will be sufficient to buy a pound of\r\nbeefsteak and potatoes for to-morrow’s dinner. Bread, tea and sugar, we\r\nhave still in the house; and to-morrow night you will bring home your\r\ntwenty-two shillings.” “May you succeed, Marie! That is all I have to\r\nsay,” was her reply. She learned of me that evening how to make the\r\ntassels, and we worked till midnight, finishing a large number.\r\n\r\nThe next day was Saturday, and some women really came to get work. I\r\ngave them just enough for one day, keeping one day’s work in reserve.\r\nThe day was spent busily in arranging matters, so that on Monday\r\nmorning, I might be able to carry a sample of the manufactured articles\r\nto those stores that I had heard mentioned as not being sufficiently\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, my sister came home without her money--the dressmaker\r\nhad gone into the country in the afternoon without paying the girls.\r\nShe was more than sad, and I felt a little uncomfortable, for what was\r\nI to do without money to provide for the next two days or to pay those\r\ngirls on Monday with whose work I might not be satisfied? What was to\r\nbe done? To go down to our landlord, the grocer, and ask him to advance\r\nus a few dollars? No! He was a stranger and had no means of knowing\r\nthat we would return the money. Besides, I did not wish the people in\r\nthe house to know of our condition.\r\n\r\nMy resolution was taken. I proposed to my sister to go to the market\r\nwith me to buy meat and fruit for the morrow. She looked at me with\r\nblank astonishment, but without heeding it I said calmly, taking from\r\nthe bureau drawer the chain of my watch, “Anna, opposite the market\r\nthere is a pawnbroker. No one knows us, and by giving a fictitious name\r\nwe can get money without thanking any one for it.” She was satisfied,\r\nand taking a little basket, we went on our errand. I asked six dollars\r\nof the pawnbroker under the name of Müller, and received the money,\r\nafter which we made our purchases and went home in quite good spirits.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the knitters brought home their work. I paid them,\r\nand gave them enough for another day, after which I set about finishing\r\neach piece, completing the task about two in the afternoon. This done,\r\nI carried the articles to Broadway, and leaving a sample in a number of\r\nstores, received orders from them for several dozens. Here, I have to\r\nremark that not being able to speak English, I conducted my business at\r\nthe different stores either in German or in French, as I easily found\r\nsome employees who could speak one of these languages.\r\n\r\nI then went to the worsted store in John Street, where I also obtained\r\norders for the manufactured articles together with ten dollars’ worth\r\nof worsted on credit, having first given my name and residence to the\r\nbookkeeper, with the names of the stores from which I had received\r\norders.\r\n\r\nIn the evening when my sister came home, I was, therefore, safely\r\nlaunched into a manufacturing business. The news cheered her greatly,\r\nbut she could not be induced to quit her sewing. The new business had\r\nsprung up so rapidly and pleasantly that she could not trust in the\r\nreality of its existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n _Social relations largely limited to learning the lives of her\r\n employees and helping them by work, by sympathy and by friendliness,\r\n and sometimes by taking them into her house to tide over an emergency.\r\n (Twenty-four years of age: 1853.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must tell you here something of the social life that we led. We had\r\nbrought a number of friendly letters with us from our acquaintances in\r\nBerlin to their friends and relatives in America; all of which upon our\r\narrival we sent by post, with the exception of two--the one sent by a\r\nneighbor to his son, Albert C., the other to a young artist, both of\r\nwhom called for their letters.\r\n\r\nAbout four weeks after we were settled in New York, we received a\r\ncall from some young men whose sisters had been schoolmates of my\r\nsisters in Berlin, who came to inquire of us where to find Mr. C. We\r\ncould give them no information, as we had not seen him since he called\r\nfor his letter; neither did we now see anything of the G.’s. But the\r\nacquaintance thus formed with these young men was continued, and our\r\nsolitude was now and then enlivened by an hour’s call from them. Soon\r\nafter I had commenced my new business, they came one day in company\r\nwith Mr. C., whom they had met accidentally in the street, and, on his\r\nexpressing a wish to see us, had taken the liberty to bring him to our\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nMy business continued to prosper, and by constantly offering none but\r\nthe best quality of goods for sale, in a very short time I had so\r\nmuch to do that my whole time in the day was occupied with out-door\r\nbusiness, and I was forced to sit up at night with my sister to prepare\r\nwork for the knitters.\r\n\r\nAt one time, we had thirty girls constantly in our employ, and in this\r\nway I became acquainted with many of those unfortunates who had been\r\nmisled and ruined on their arrival by persons pretending friendship.\r\nTwo of these in particular interested me greatly.\r\n\r\nOne, the granddaughter of a famous German and bearing his name, was the\r\ndaughter of a physician. She had come to this country hoping to find a\r\nplace as governess. Poor girl! She was a mere wreck when I found her,\r\nand all my efforts to raise her up were in vain. She was sick and in a\r\nterrible mental condition. We took her into our house, nursed her and\r\ncared for her. When she recovered, we supplied her with work for which\r\nwe paid her so well that she always had three dollars a week, which\r\npaid for her board and washing. It was twice as much as she could earn,\r\nyet not enough to make her feel reconciled with life.\r\n\r\nAt one time, she did not come to us for a whole week. I went to see\r\nher, and her landlady told me that she was melancholy. I persuaded\r\nher to come and stay with us for a few days, but in spite of all\r\nmy friendly encouragement, I could not succeed in restoring her to\r\ncheerfulness. She owned that she could not work merely to live; she\r\ndid not feel the pangs of hunger, but she felt the want of comforts\r\nto which she had been accustomed and which in our days are regarded as\r\nnecessities.\r\n\r\nShe attempted to find a situation as governess, but her proficiency\r\nin music, French and drawing counted as nothing. She had no city\r\nreferences, and though having been two years in New York, dared not\r\nname the place to which she had been conducted on her arrival. She\r\nleft us at last in despair after having been a week with us. She never\r\ncalled again and I could not learn from her landlady where she had gone.\r\n\r\nThree months afterwards, I heard from one of the girls in our employ\r\nthat she had married a poor shoemaker in order to have a home, but I\r\nnever learned whether this was true. About a year later, I met her in\r\nthe Bowery, poorly but cleanly dressed. She hastily turned away her\r\nface on seeing me, and I only caught a glimpse of the crimson flush\r\nthat overspread her countenance.\r\n\r\nThe other girl that I referred to was a Miss Mary ----, who came with\r\nher mother to this country, expecting to live with a brother. They\r\nfound the brother married and unwilling to support his sister, while\r\nhis wife was by no means friendly in her reception of his mother. The\r\ngood girl determined to earn support for her mother, and a pretended\r\nfriend offered to take care of their things until she could find work\r\nand rent lodgings. After four weeks’ search, she found a little room\r\nand bedroom in a rear building in Elizabeth Street at five dollars a\r\nmonth, and was preparing to move when her “friend” presented a bill of\r\nforty dollars for his services. She could only satisfy his rapacity\r\nby selling everything that she could possibly spare, after which she\r\ncommenced to work, and as she embroidered a great deal besides working\r\nfor me (for which I paid her six dollars a week), for a time she lived\r\ntolerably well.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, her mother fell ill, and she had to nurse her and\r\nattend to the household as well as to labor for their support. It was a\r\ntrying time for the poor girl. She sought her brother, but he had moved\r\nto the West. I did all that I could for her, but this was not half\r\nenough. And after I had quitted the manufacturing business and left\r\nthe city, my sister heard that she had drowned herself in the Hudson,\r\nbecause her mother’s corpse was lying in the house while she had not\r\na cent to give it burial or to buy a piece of bread unless she sold\r\nherself to vice.\r\n\r\nAre not these two terrible romances of New York life? And many besides\r\ndid I learn among these poor women, so many indeed that I forget the\r\ndetails of them all. Stories of this kind are said to be without\r\nfoundation, but I say that there are more of them in our midst than it\r\nis possible to imagine.\r\n\r\nWomen of good education but without money are forced to earn their\r\nliving. They determine to leave their home, either because false pride\r\nprevents their seeking work where they have been brought up as ladies,\r\nor because this work is so scarce that they cannot earn by it even a\r\nlife of semi-starvation, while they are encouraged to believe that in\r\nthis country they will readily find proper employment.\r\n\r\nThey are too well educated to become domestics, better educated indeed\r\nthan half the teachers here, but modesty, and the habit of thinking\r\nthat they must pass through the same legal ordeal as in Europe, prevent\r\nthem from seeking places in this capacity. They all know how to\r\nembroider in the most beautiful manner, and knowing that this is well\r\npaid for in Europe, they seek to find employment of this kind in the\r\nstores.\r\n\r\nNot being able to speak English, they believe the stories of the clerks\r\nand proprietors, are made to work at low wages, and are often swindled\r\nout of their money. They feel homesick, forlorn and forsaken in the\r\nworld. Their health at length fails them, and they cannot earn bread\r\nenough to keep themselves from starvation. They are too proud to beg,\r\nand the consequence is that they walk the streets or throw themselves\r\ninto the river.\r\n\r\nI met scores of these friendless women. Some I took into my house; for\r\nothers I found work and made myself a sort of guardian; while to others\r\nI gave friendship to keep them morally alive. It is a curious fact that\r\nthese women are chiefly Germans. The Irish resort at once to beggary or\r\nare inveigled into brothels as soon as they arrive, while the French\r\nare always intriguing enough either to put on a white cap and find a\r\nplace as _bonne_, or to secure a _private_ lover.\r\n\r\nI am often in despair about the helplessness of women, and the\r\nreadiness of men to let them earn money in abundance by shame while\r\nthey are ground down to the merest pittance for honorable work.\r\n\r\nShame on society, that women are forced to surrender themselves to\r\nan abandoned life and to death when so many are enjoying wealth and\r\nluxury in extravagance! I do not wish the rich to divide their estates\r\nwith the poor--I am no friend to communism in any form. I only wish\r\ninstitutions that shall give to women an education from childhood that\r\nwill enable them, like young men, to earn their livelihood. These weak\r\nwomen are the last to come forth to aid in their emancipation from\r\ninefficient education. We cannot calculate upon these; we must educate\r\nthe children for better positions, and leave the adults to their\r\ndestiny.\r\n\r\nHow many women marry only for a shelter or a home! How often have I\r\nbeen the confidante of girls who the day before, arrayed in satin, had\r\ngiven their hands to rich men before the altar, while their hearts were\r\nbreaking with suppressed agony! And this, too, in America, this great\r\nfree nation, which, notwithstanding, lets its women starve.\r\n\r\nIt is but lately that a young woman said to me, “I thank Heaven, my\r\ndear doctor, that you are a woman, for now I can tell you the truth\r\nabout my health. It is not my body that is sick, but my heart. These\r\nflounces and velvets cover a body that is sold--sold legally to a man\r\nwho could pay my father’s debts.”\r\n\r\nOh! I scorn men, sometimes, from the bottom of my heart. Still, this is\r\nwrong, for it is the fault of the woman--of the mother--in educating\r\nher daughter to be merely a beautiful machine fit to ornament a fine\r\nestablishment; not gaining this, there is nothing left but wretchedness\r\nof mind and body.\r\n\r\nWomen, there is a connection between the Fifth Avenue and the Five\r\nPoints! Both the rich and the wretched are types of womanhood, both\r\nare linked together forming one great body, and both have the same part\r\nin good and evil. I can hardly leave this subject, though it may seem\r\nto have little to do with my American experience, but a word spoken\r\nfrom a full heart not only gives relief but may carry a message to at\r\nleast one listening ear with far-reaching results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n _Her former rival (and later her successor), Sister Catherine, comes\r\n from Berlin to New York to ask her aid--Marie is joined also by a\r\n second sister and a brother--She is robbed of all her savings--The\r\n end of her first year in America finds her profoundly depressed\r\n because, though successful in business, she has found no opening in\r\n her profession--Her hopes are suddenly renewed by hearing of Dr.\r\n Elizabeth Blackwell upon whom she calls. (Twenty-four years of age:\r\n 1853-1854.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI must now return to my new enterprise. The business paid well, and,\r\nalthough I was often forced to work with my sister till the dawn of\r\nmorning, we were happy, for we had all that we needed, and I could\r\nwrite home that the offered assistance was superfluous.\r\n\r\nHere I must say that I had resolved, on leaving Berlin, never to ask\r\nfor aid, in order that I might be able with perfect freedom to carry\r\nout my plans independently of my family. How this was ever to be done,\r\nI did not yet see, though I had a good opportunity to learn, from\r\nlife and from the papers, what I had to expect here. But this mode of\r\ninstruction, though useful to one seeking to become a philosopher, was\r\nvery unsatisfactory to me.\r\n\r\nThe chief thing that I learned was that I must acquire English before\r\nI could undertake anything. And this was the most difficult point to\r\novercome. I am not a linguist by nature; all that I learn of languages\r\nmust be obtained by the greatest perseverance and industry, and for\r\nthis my business would not allow me time.\r\n\r\nShortly after I had fairly established myself in the manufacturing\r\nbusiness, I received news from Berlin that Sister Catherine had left\r\nthe Hospital Charité and was intending to join me in America, in order\r\nto aid me in carrying out my plan for the establishment of a hospital\r\nfor women in the New World. The parties interested in her had finally\r\nsucceeded in placing her in the wished-for position, thus disconnecting\r\nher from the sisterhood. But, after my departure, the position became\r\ngreatly modified in rank and inferior in character. Private reasons,\r\nbesides, made it disagreeable for her to remain there any longer, and\r\nin this moment she remembered my friendship towards her. And in the\r\nunfortunate belief which she shared with many others that all that I\r\ndesigned to do I could do, she at once resolved to come to me and offer\r\nher assistance.\r\n\r\nShe joined us on the 22d of August, and was not a little disappointed\r\nto find me in the tassel business instead of in the medical line. The\r\nastonishment with which her acquaintances in Berlin heard her announce\r\nher intention of going to seek help from a person to whom she had been\r\nless than a friend could not be expressed in words. And she told me\r\nthat the annoyance they manifested was really the chief stimulus that\r\ndecided her to come at last. She arrived without a cent. Having always\r\nfound enough friends ready to supply her with money whenever she\r\nwished to establish a temporary hospital, it had never occurred to her\r\nthat she should need any for private use beyond just enough to furnish\r\nthe simple blue merino dress of the sisterhood, which had often been\r\nprovided for her by the Kaiserswerth Institute.\r\n\r\nBut here she was, and she very soon learned to understand the\r\ndifficulties which must be overcome before I could enter again into my\r\nprofession. She became satisfied, and lived with us, sharing equally in\r\nwhatever we had ourselves. There is a peculiar satisfaction in showing\r\nkindness to a person who has injured us even though unconsciously, but\r\nin her case, she was not entirely unconscious of the harm she had done\r\nme. While in America she confessed to me that her acquaintance had\r\nbeen courted by all those who had opposed my appointment and that they\r\nsought every opportunity to annoy me.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September, a sister, one year younger than myself,\r\njoined us, having been tempted by our favorable accounts to try a life\r\nof adventure. We were now four in family.\r\n\r\nBut Catherine gradually grew discontented. Having been accustomed to\r\nthe comforts afforded in large institutions and to receiving attentions\r\nfrom the most aristocratic families of Prussia, the monotonous life\r\nthat we led was endurable to her only so long as the novelty lasted.\r\nThis soon wore off, and she became anxious for a change.\r\n\r\nShe had heard her fellow-passengers speak of a Pastor S., who had been\r\nsent to America as a missionary, and she begged me to seek him out and\r\ntake her to him that she might consult him as to what she had best\r\ndo. I did so, and she soon became acquainted with his family. Mr. S.\r\nexerted himself in her behalf and secured her a place as nurse in the\r\nHome for the Friendless, where she had charge of some thirty children.\r\n\r\nThis was a heavy task, for though none was under a year old, she\r\nwas constantly disturbed through the night and could get but a few\r\nconsecutive hours of sleep. Besides, she could not become reconciled to\r\nwashing under the hydrant in the morning and to being forced to mingle\r\nwith the commonest Irish girls. She was in every respect a lady and had\r\nbeen accustomed to having a servant at her command, even in the midst\r\nof the typhus fever epidemic in the desolate districts of Silesia,\r\nwhile here she was not treated even with humanity.\r\n\r\nThis soon grew unbearable, and she returned to us on the 16th of\r\nOctober, after having been only ten days in the institution. So eager\r\nwas she to make her escape that she did not even ask for the two\r\ndollars that were due her for wages. But we could not receive her, for\r\nwe had taken another woman in her place who was as friendless and as\r\npenniless as she.\r\n\r\nBesides, a misfortune had just fallen upon us. During the night before,\r\nour doors had been unlocked, our bureau drawers inspected, and all our\r\nmoney, amounting to fifty-two dollars, carried off. And when Catherine\r\narrived, we were so poor that we had to borrow the bread and milk for\r\nour breakfast. Fortunately, the day before, I had refused the payment\r\ndue me for a large bill of goods, and this came now in a very good\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI did not feel justified, however, in increasing the family to five\r\nafter our loss, nor did she claim our assistance, but went again to\r\nPastor S. who had invited her to visit his family. With his assistance,\r\nshe obtained some private nursing, which maintained her until the\r\ncongregation had collected money enough to enable her to return to\r\nBerlin, which she did on the 2d of December. Having many friends in the\r\nbest circles of that city, she immediately found a good practice again\r\nand she is now, as she says, enjoying life in a civilized manner.\r\n\r\nWe moved at once from the scene of the robbery and took a part of a\r\nhouse in Monroe Street, for which we paid two hundred dollars a year.\r\nOur business continued good, and I had some prospect of getting into\r\npractice. But with the spring (1854), the demand for worsted goods\r\nceased, and as my practice brought me work but no money, I was forced\r\nto look for something else to do.\r\n\r\nBy accident, I saw in a store a coiffure made of silk in imitation\r\nof hair, which I bought. But I found on examination that I could not\r\nmanufacture it as it was machine work. I went, therefore, to Mr. G.\r\nand proposed to him the establishment of a business in which he should\r\nmanufacture these coiffures, while I would sell them by wholesale to\r\nthe merchants with whom I was acquainted.\r\n\r\nMr. G. had completely ruined himself during the winter by neglecting\r\nhis business and meddling with Tammany Hall politics, which had wasted\r\nhis money and his time. He had not a single workman in his shop when I\r\ncalled, and he was too much discouraged to think of any new enterprise;\r\nbut on my telling him that I would be responsible for the first\r\noutlay, he engaged hands and in less than a month had forty-eight\r\npersons busily employed. In this way, I earned money during the spring\r\nand freed myself from the obligations which his kindness in receiving\r\nus the spring before had laid upon us.\r\n\r\nMy chief business now was to sell the goods manufactured by Mr. G. Our\r\nworsted business was very small, and the prospect was that it would\r\ncease entirely, and also that the coiffure that we made would not long\r\ncontinue in fashion. Some other business, therefore, had to be found,\r\nespecially as it was impossible for us to lay up money.\r\n\r\nOur family now consisted of myself and two sisters, the friend that was\r\nstaying with us, and a brother, nineteen years of age, who had just\r\njoined us during the winter and who, though an engineer and in good\r\nbusiness, was, like most young men, thoughtless and more likely to\r\nincrease than to lighten our burdens. Our friend Mr. C., who had become\r\nour constant visitor, planned at this time a journey to Europe, so that\r\nour social life seemed also about to come to an end.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of May, 1854, as I was riding down to the stores on my\r\nusual business, reveries of the past took possession of my mind.\r\nAlmost a year in America, and not one step advanced towards my\r\npurpose in coming hither! It was true that I had a comfortable home,\r\nwith enough to live on, and had repaid to my sister the money that I\r\nhad borrowed from her on our arrival; yet what kind of life was it\r\nthat I was leading, in a business foreign both to my nature and to\r\nmy inclinations, and without even the prospect of enlarging this?\r\nThese reflections made me so sad that when I reached the store, the\r\nbookkeeper, noticing my dejection, told me by way of cheering me that\r\nhe had another order for a hundred dollars’ worth of goods, etc., but\r\nthis did not relieve me.\r\n\r\nI entered the omnibus again, speculating constantly on what I should\r\ndo next. Everywhere, my inquiries about women physicians were\r\nreceived with a pitiful shrug of the shoulders, and I could obtain no\r\ninformation concerning the Philadelphia Female Medical College whose\r\nreport I had read in Berlin. I had finally consulted the newspapers in\r\nspite of all the warnings against so doing, and I was almost at the\r\npoint of calling upon a Mr. and Mrs. B. who advertised their private\r\nlying-in hospital (Mrs. B., after becoming a widow, resumed the name of\r\nher first husband and became the originator of the homeopathic medical\r\ncollege for women), when a thought suddenly dawned upon me.\r\n\r\nMight not the people in the Home for the Friendless be able to give\r\nme advice? I had hardly conceived the idea, when I determined to ride\r\ndirectly up there instead of stopping at the street in which I lived.\r\nI thought, besides, that some employment might be found for my sister\r\nAnna where she could learn the English language for which she had\r\nevinced some talent, although I had decided that I could never become\r\nmaster of it.\r\n\r\nI had once seen the matron, Miss Goodrich, when I had called there on\r\nCatherine S. She had a humane face, and I was persuaded that I should\r\nfind a friend in her. I was not mistaken. I told her of my plans in\r\ncoming here and of our present mode of life and prospects, and confided\r\nto her my disappointment and dejection as well as my determination to\r\npersevere courageously. She seemed to understand and to enter into my\r\nfeelings and promised to see Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, whom she advised\r\nme to call upon at once.\r\n\r\nI went home full of the hope and inspiration of a new life--the\r\nhappiness of that morning can hardly be comprehended. I was not\r\nsuffering, it is true, for the necessaries of life, but what was far\r\nworse, I suffered from the feeling that I lived for no purpose but to\r\neat and to drink. I had no friends who were interested in the pursuits\r\ntowards which my nature inclined, and I saw crowds of arrogant people\r\nabout me to whom I could not prove that I was their equal in spite\r\nof their money. My sisters had not seen me so cheerful since our\r\narrival in America and they thought that I had surely discovered the\r\nphilosophers’ stone. I told them of what I had done and received their\r\napprobation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n _Learns that Dr. Blackwell is working for the same purpose that\r\n brought her (Marie) to America, that is, to establish a Hospital for\r\n Women; and that she (Dr. Blackwell) has already progressed as far\r\n as opening a dispensary (the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women\r\n and Children)--Dr. Blackwell invites Marie to assist her in the\r\n dispensary, gives her lessons in English, and urges her to acquire\r\n the degree of M.D.--Elizabeth Blackwell first English-speaking woman\r\n to receive such degree--Italian, German and French women her only\r\n predecessors in this respect--Since beginning of the race, women have\r\n instinctively practiced obstetrics and general medicine but their\r\n education has been opposed--Marie’s business goes out of fashion--She\r\n substitutes a new one which pays very poorly and is complicated by\r\n frequent suggestions for irregular sex life with employers--Refusal\r\n leads to loss of work--She is compelled to draw on her savings--In the\r\n autumn with a balance of fifty dollars, she sets out for Cleveland\r\n to enter the Medical Department of the Western Reserve College.\r\n (Twenty-five years of age: 1854.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 15th of May, 1854--the anniversary of the death\r\nof Dr. Schmidt, the day of my greatest joy and my greatest misery--we\r\nreceived a call from Miss Goodrich who told us that she had seen\r\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell, and that she thought she had also procured\r\na suitable place for my sister. She gave us the addresses of Dr.\r\nBlackwell and of Miss Catherine Sedgwick.\r\n\r\nWe called first upon the latter, who was extremely kind, and although\r\nshe had quite misunderstood our wishes--having exerted herself to\r\nprocure a place for my sister in a way that manifested the belief that\r\nwe had neither a home nor the means to live--yet her friendliness and\r\nreadiness to assist us made us forever grateful to her. At that time we\r\ndid not know her standing in society and looked upon her merely as a\r\nbenevolent and wealthy woman. We soon learned more of her, however, for\r\nthough unsuccessful in her first efforts, she shortly after sent for\r\nmy sister, having secured for her a place in Mr. Theodore Sedgwick’s\r\nfamily, which was acceptable inasmuch as it placed her above the level\r\nof the servants. She remained there for seven weeks and then returned\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nOn the same morning, I saw Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell--and from this call\r\nof the 15th of May, 1854, I date my new life in America. She spoke a\r\nlittle German and understood me perfectly when I talked. I gave her all\r\nmy certificates for inspection, but said nothing to her of my plans\r\nin coming to America. It would have seemed too ludicrous for me in my\r\nposition to tell her that I entertained the idea of interesting the\r\npeople in the establishment of a hospital for women. I hardly know what\r\nI told her, indeed, for I had no other plan of which to speak, and\r\ntherefore talked confusedly like an adventurer. I only know that I said\r\nthat I would even take the position of nurse if I could enter one of\r\nthe large hospitals, in order to learn the manner in which they were\r\nmanaged in this country.\r\n\r\nI cannot comprehend how Dr. Blackwell could ever have taken so deep an\r\ninterest in me as she manifested that morning, for I never in my life\r\nwas so little myself. Yet she did take this interest, for she gave me\r\na sketch of her own experience in acquiring a medical education and\r\nexplained the requirements for such in this country and the obstacles\r\nthat are thrown in the way of women who seek to become physicians.\r\n\r\nShe told me of her plan of founding a hospital--the long-cherished idea\r\nof my life--and said that she had opened a little dispensary on the 1st\r\nof May, two weeks before (the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and\r\nChildren), which was designed to be the nucleus for this hospital, and\r\nshe invited me to come and assist her.\r\n\r\nShe insisted that first of all I should learn English, and she offered\r\nto give me lessons twice a week and also to make efforts to enable\r\nme to enter a college to acquire the title of “M.D.,” which I had\r\nnot the right to attach to my name. I left her after several hours’\r\nconversation, and we parted friends.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Blackwell, in her autobiography, tells of writing to her sister,\r\nDr. Emily, giving her impression of this interview: “I have at last\r\nfound a student in whom I can take a great deal of interest, Marie\r\nZakrzewska, a German about twenty-six.... There is true stuff in her,\r\nand I shall do my best to bring it out.... She must obtain a medical\r\ndegree.”]\r\n\r\nI found Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell a rather short but stately lady, blonde\r\nwith wavy hair, very dignified, kindly in speech, and very deliberate\r\nand wise in her remarks.\r\n\r\nThe cordiality with which she welcomed me as a co-worker, I can never\r\ndescribe nor forget. It aroused all my sunken hopes and energies and\r\ndirected them again to the field of work which I had cultivated and\r\nwhich I had almost given up in despair. Now, I was finding the welcome\r\nand the beginning of which I had dreamed, and all the many days of\r\ndisappointment were instantly forgotten.\r\n\r\nI met in Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell no eccentric person who wanted to\r\nbring about the millennium for women, for I soon learned from her of\r\nthe great obstacles which were to be overcome in the social stratum.\r\nSoon, indeed, I learned that social prejudices, habits and customs can\r\nbe as strong barriers to intellectual development as those placed in\r\nthe way of reform by a despotic German government.\r\n\r\nHowever, behind this social barrier, a number of high-minded and\r\nintellectually advanced women were ready to enter upon a struggle\r\nfor greater freedom of action. They were especially inspired by the\r\nAnti-Slavery movement, which was then fully established and which\r\nappealed so strongly to the emotional nature of women. The paths these\r\nwomen trod were full of thorns and thistles yet they bore everything\r\npatiently, for, knowing their country and its people, they foresaw all\r\nthe possibilities for good which could be achieved.\r\n\r\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell, while not the first woman practitioner of\r\nmedicine even in America, was yet the pioneer in the movement which\r\ninsisted that medical women should be educated so as to stand equal\r\nwith men physicians in medical knowledge and in legalized position.\r\nHence, she began her medical life not by practicing her art but by\r\nworking for the degree of “M.D.” from one of the regularly constituted\r\nmedical colleges, this meaning at that time a medical college\r\nestablished exclusively for men.\r\n\r\nIn this course, she followed the example of at least three Italian\r\nwomen who had, near the end of the eighteenth century and in the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth, taken the medical degree at the\r\nUniversities of Florence and Bologna. But her autobiography is well\r\nentitled, _Pioneer Work in Opening the Medical Profession to\r\nWomen_, because nothing of this kind had been undertaken by an\r\nEnglish-speaking woman. Exceptionally, women have, here and there,\r\nreceived the same training as men, as evidenced by ancient histories.\r\nAnd early in this nineteenth century, two German women had received\r\nthe medical degree at the University of Giessen. And the French\r\nobstetrician, Madame Boivin, had the medical degree conferred on her by\r\nthe University of Marburg before she died in 1841.\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest history of the human race, women have been the\r\npractitioners of obstetrics, and thence, naturally, the practitioners\r\nin the diseases of women and children.\r\n\r\nBut even such women suffered from the subjection which was inflicted\r\nupon all their sex. Hence, as the science of medicine became organized,\r\nand as systematized instruction in both the science and the art became\r\nestablished, opportunities for study and advanced practice were more\r\nand more monopolized by men; and women were more and more hindered\r\nfrom exercising and developing their instinctive tendencies in these\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nBut the monopoly has never been secure. Always, large numbers of\r\npeople, especially of women, have persisted in the desire to be\r\nadvised medically by women; and always, a certain number of women have\r\nresponded to their instincts and have prepared themselves as best they\r\ncould to give medical advice and help, especially to women and children.\r\n\r\nThus even at this date all over the world large numbers of women\r\ncontinued to practice obstetrics, largely as “midwives.” But a\r\nconsiderable number of women also practiced general medicine,\r\nespecially where they did not come in conflict with medical or civil\r\nlaws, which were designed to exclude all except the practitioners of\r\nthe dominant medical group. The passage of laws regulating the practice\r\nof medicine is undoubtedly actuated by a sincere desire to raise the\r\nstandard of medical practice throughout the community, but only too\r\nfrequently these laws give power to a group of medical oligarchs, a\r\nfact which I was many times to observe later.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the last class of women just described is Dr.\r\nHarriot K. Hunt, who was at this date preparing for publication\r\nher autobiography which appeared under the title of _Glances and\r\nGlimpses_.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackwell was graduated from the Geneva (New York) Medical College,\r\nin 1849, and she then went to Europe to obtain the clinical experience\r\nwhich was denied to women in America, returning to see her sister Emily\r\nalso become a regular M.D. (1854).\r\n\r\nThe two sisters procured a charter from the New York Legislature to\r\nestablish the New York Infirmary for Indigent Women and Children, both\r\nfeeling the absolute necessity for continued clinical experience before\r\noffering their services to suffering humanity at large. Dr. Emily then\r\nwent to Europe for special clinical study and she was still there. Dr.\r\nBlackwell said to me, “My sister has just gone to Europe to finish what\r\nshe began here, and you have come here to finish what you began in\r\nEurope.”\r\n\r\nAnd here I am obliged to give a short statement of the mode of study in\r\nthe medical profession at that time.\r\n\r\nThe young student had to find a “preceptor,” a physician of good\r\nstanding, with whom he studied the preliminaries necessary for\r\nentering a medical college or school. He also visited patients with\r\nthis preceptor and assisted the latter in every way possible. The\r\nstudent thus became familiar with the details of practice even before\r\nmatriculating regularly in a medical college. I have met young men who\r\nhad been for years such assistants to physicians, and who later entered\r\ncollege merely to become legally qualified.\r\n\r\nAny student who could bring certificates from an acceptable preceptor\r\ncould easily procure a diploma by attending the medical school of any\r\ncollege for two short successive winter sessions, often of only sixteen\r\nweeks’ duration.\r\n\r\nThis method of clinical experience in private practice made hospital\r\nattendance by the student seem almost unnecessary. Even opportunities\r\nfor attendance at dispensaries, when such existed in the larger cities,\r\nwere not much sought after by the young men, they feeling that they\r\ncould gain all the required knowledge by attaching themselves to\r\npreceptors.\r\n\r\nSociety, and indeed civilization in general, was in a primitive stage\r\nof development, in spite of material elegance, yes, even of luxury and\r\nrefined manners. It would take a long time to describe the great change\r\nwhich has taken place in the educational and intellectual development\r\nof the people in the United States and the increased facilities which\r\nthey have for the higher and deeper studies.\r\n\r\nThe time which it would take with a monarchically limited people to\r\nadvance any social improvement or reform would require generations,\r\nwhile under free, unlimited social laws, months instead of years will\r\nserve to bring about the desired evolution.\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, I became the student of Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell, she assuming the rôle of medical preceptor, as well as most\r\npatient instructor in the English language.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of her having obtained a charter for a hospital, a few\r\nhigh-minded and progressive friends had contributed sufficient money\r\nto open one room for dispensary purposes in a very poor quarter of\r\nthe East Side of New York. Here poor women and children came three\r\nafternoons a week, from three to five o’clock, for medical advice\r\nand such simple medicines as Dr. Blackwell could dispense without\r\nassistance, until I became her pupil.\r\n\r\nThe beneficiaries were by no means always grateful; on the contrary,\r\nthey often considered themselves as important patrons of the women\r\ndoctors. An incident will illustrate this.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the hall of the Dispensary, the few settees were filled\r\nwith patients waiting for our arrival, and two old and decrepit women\r\nhad taken seats on the curbstone of the sidewalk, also waiting for us.\r\nIt unavoidably happened that we were fifteen minutes behind the regular\r\ntime for opening the Dispensary.\r\n\r\nAs these two old women saw us turning around the corner of Second\r\nAvenue, one of them called to those within hearing in the hall, “There\r\ncome the Dispensary women now!”\r\n\r\nAnd to us, she said, reproachfully, “Those ladies in the hall have been\r\nwaiting a whole hour already.”\r\n\r\nI continued my work at home, going regularly to Dr. Blackwell to\r\nreceive lessons in English and to assist her in the Dispensary. As we\r\ngrew better acquainted, I disclosed more to her of the fact that I had\r\na fixed plan in coming to this country, which increased her interest in\r\nme.\r\n\r\nShe wrote in my behalf to the different colleges, and at length\r\nsucceeded in obtaining admission for me to the Cleveland Medical\r\nCollege (Western Reserve) on the most favorable terms, credit being\r\ngiven me on the lecture fees for an indefinite time.\r\n\r\nHere I must stop to tell you why this credit was necessary. The\r\narticles that I had manufactured had gone out of fashion in May, and I\r\ncould not invent anything new, partly because I no longer felt the same\r\ninterest as before, knowing that I should soon go to a medical college,\r\nand partly because the articles then in fashion were cheaper when\r\nimported.\r\n\r\nWe had to live for a little while on the money that we had laid up,\r\nuntil I procured a commission for embroidering caps. It is perfectly\r\nwonderful into what kinds of business I was forced, all foreign to my\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me tell you some secrets of this kind of business, in\r\nwhich hundreds of women starve and hundreds more go down to a life of\r\ninfamy.\r\n\r\nCap-making (the great business of Water Street of New York) gives\r\nemployment to thousands of unfortunates. For embroidering caps, the\r\nwholesale dealer pays seven cents each; and for making up, three cents.\r\nTo make a dozen a day, one must work for sixteen hours.\r\n\r\nThe embroidering is done in this wise: I received the cut cloth from\r\nthe wholesale dealer; drew the pattern upon each cap; gave them with\r\nthree cents’ worth of silk to the embroiderer, who received three cents\r\nfor her work; then pressed and returned them; thus making one cent on\r\neach for myself.\r\n\r\nBy working steadily for sixteen hours, a girl could embroider fifteen\r\nin a day. I gave out about six dozen daily, earning like the rest fifty\r\ncents a day; unless I chose to do the stamping and pressing at night\r\nand to embroider a dozen during the day, in which case I earned a\r\ndollar. One can live in this way for a little while until health fails\r\nor the merchant says that the work has come to an end.\r\n\r\nYou will think this terrible again. Oh, no! This is not terrible. The\r\ngood men provide another way.\r\n\r\nThey tell every woman of a prepossessing appearance that it is wrong\r\nin her to work so hard, that many a man would be glad to care for her,\r\nand that many women live quite comfortably with the help of a “friend.”\r\nThey say, further, that it is lonely to live without ever going to\r\nchurch, to the concert and theater, and that if these women would only\r\npermit the speakers to visit them and to attend them to any of these\r\nplaces, they would soon find that they would no longer be obliged to\r\nwork so hard.\r\n\r\nThis is the polished talk of gentlemen who enjoy the reputation of\r\npiety and respectability and who think it a bad speculation to pay\r\nwomen liberally for their work. So it would be, in truth, for these\r\npoor creatures would not be so willing to abandon themselves to a\r\ndisreputable life if they could procure bread in any other way.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1854, I took work on commission from men of this\r\nsort. While in Berlin, I had learned from the prostitutes in the\r\nhospital in what manner educated women often became what they then were.\r\n\r\nThe average story was always the same. Love, even the purest, made\r\nthem weak; their lover deceived and deserted them; their family cast\r\nthem off by way of punishment. In their disgrace, they went to bury\r\nthemselves in large cities, where the work that they could find\r\nscarcely gave them their daily bread. Their employers, attracted by\r\ntheir personal appearance and the refinements of their speech and\r\nmanners, offered them assistance in another way, in which they could\r\nearn money without work. In despair, they accepted the proposals and\r\nsank gradually step by step to the depths of degradation, as depicted\r\nby Hogarth in the _Harlot’s Progress_.\r\n\r\nIn New York, I was thrown continually among men who were of the stamp\r\nthat I described before, and I can say, even from my own experience,\r\nthat no man is ever more polite, more friendly or more kind than one\r\nwho has impure wishes in his heart. It is really so dangerous for a\r\nwoman of refined nature to go to such stores that I never suffered my\r\nsister to visit them; not because I feared that she would listen to\r\nthese men, but because I could not endure the thought that so innocent\r\nand beautiful a girl should come in contact with them or even breathe\r\nthe same atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhen fathers are unwilling that their daughters shall enter life as\r\nphysicians, lawyers, merchants, or in any other public capacity, it is\r\nsimply because they belong to the class that so contaminates the air\r\nthat none can breathe it but themselves; or because, from being thrown\r\nconstantly in contact with such men, they arrive at the same point at\r\nwhich I then stood, and say to themselves, “_I_ can afford to meet\r\nsuch men. I am steeled by my knowledge of mankind and supported by the\r\nphilosophy that I have learned during years of trial. It cannot hurt\r\n_me_; but by all means, spare the young and beautiful the same\r\nexperience!”\r\n\r\nI dealt somewhat haughtily with the merchants whom I have described,\r\nin a manner that at once convinced them of my position. But the\r\nconsequence was that the embroidery commission which had commenced so\r\nfavorably, suddenly ceased, “because the Southern trade had failed”; in\r\ntruth, because I would not allow any of these men to say any more to me\r\nthan was absolutely necessary in our business.\r\n\r\nMy income became less and less, and we were forced to live upon the\r\nmoney that we had laid up during the year. I did not look for any\r\nnew sources of employment for I was intending to go to Cleveland in\r\nOctober. My next sister had business of her own, and Anna was engaged\r\nto be married to our friend Mr. C. My brother was also with them, and\r\nmy mother’s brother, whom she had adopted as a child, was on his way to\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nAfter having settled our affairs, fifty dollars remained as my share,\r\nand with this sum I set out for Cleveland, on the 16th of October,\r\n1854. Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell had supplied me with the necessary\r\nmedical textbooks, so that I had no other expenses than those of my\r\njourney and the matriculation fees which together amounted to twenty\r\ndollars, leaving thirty dollars in my possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n _Attends the medical course at Cleveland, learning English at\r\n the same time--Is befriended by the Dean, Dr. John J. Delamater,\r\n and by Mrs. Caroline M. Severance--Some professors and students\r\n object to women as students--Students petition faculty to exclude\r\n women--Petition by Harvard medical students against admission\r\n of Dr. Harriot K.

(Twenty-five years of age: 1854.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nI do not believe that many begin the study of medicine with so light a\r\npurse and so heavy a heart as did I. My heart was heavy for the reason\r\nthat I did not know a single sentence of English. All of my study\r\nwith Dr. Blackwell had been like raindrops falling upon stone; I had\r\nprofited nothing.\r\n\r\nThe lectures I did not care for, since there was more need of my\r\nstudying English than medicine, but the subjects were well known to me,\r\nand I therefore reasoned that by hearing familiar things treated of in\r\nEnglish, I must learn the language--and the logic held good.\r\n\r\nI have already told you that the faculty had agreed to give me credit\r\nfor my lecture fees. Dr. Blackwell had written also to a lady in\r\nCleveland, who had called upon her some time before in the capacity of\r\npresident of a Physiological Society which, among other good things,\r\nhad established a small fund for the assistance of women desirous of\r\nstudying medicine. This lady (Mrs. Caroline M. Severance) replied in\r\nthe most friendly manner, saying that I might come directly to her\r\nhouse, and that she would see that my board for the winter was secured\r\nby the Physiological Society over which she presided.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Cleveland was a silent but a pleasant one. Through a\r\nmishap, I arrived on Saturday night instead of in the morning, and\r\nbeing unwilling to disturb Mrs. Severance at so late an hour, I went\r\nfirst to a hotel. But what trials I had there! No one could understand\r\nme, until at last I wrote on a slate my own name and that of Mrs.\r\nSeverance, with the words, “A carriage” and “to-morrow.” From this,\r\nthe people inferred that I wished to stay at the hotel all night and\r\nto have a carriage to take me to Mrs. Severance’s the next day, as was\r\nthe case. A waiter took my carpet-bag and conducted me to a room. I\r\ncould not understand his directions to the supper-room, neither could\r\nI make him understand that I wanted some supper in my own room; and the\r\nconsequence was that I went to bed hungry, having eaten nothing all day\r\nbut a little bread and an apple for luncheon.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was dressed the next morning, I rang the bell furiously,\r\nand on the appearance of the waiter, exclaimed, “Beefsteak!” This\r\ntime he comprehended me, and went laughingly away to bring me a good\r\nbreakfast. I often saw the same waiter afterwards at the hotel, and he\r\nnever saw me without laughing and exclaiming, “Beefsteak!”\r\n\r\nIn the course of the forenoon, I was taken in a carriage to the house\r\nof Mrs. Severance, but the family was not at home. I returned to the\r\nhotel somewhat disheartened and disappointed. Although I should have\r\nsupposed that death was not far off if some disappointment had not\r\nhappened to me when I least expected it, yet this persistent going\r\nwrong of everything in Cleveland was really rather dispiriting. But\r\na bright star soon broke through the clouds in the shape of Mr.\r\nSeverance, who came into the parlor directly after dinner, calling for\r\nme in so easy and so cordial a manner that I forgot everything and was\r\nperfectly happy.\r\n\r\nThis feeling, however, lasted only until I reached the house. I found\r\nfour fine children, all full of childish curiosity to hear me talk,\r\nbut who, as soon as they found that I could not make myself understood\r\nby them, looked on me with that sort of contempt peculiar to children\r\nwhen they discover that a person cannot do as much as they themselves\r\ncan. Mr. Severance, too, was expecting to find me accomplished in\r\nmusic “like all Germans,” and had to learn that I had neither voice nor\r\near for the art. Mrs. Severance understood a little German, yet not\r\nhalf enough to gain any idea of how much or how little I was capable\r\nof doing, and therefore looked upon me with a sort of uncertainty\r\nas to what was my real capacity. This position was more provoking\r\nthan painful--there was even something ludicrous in it, and when not\r\nannoyed, I often went into my room to indulge in a hearty laugh by\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n [Mrs. Severance tells of this first meeting:\r\n\r\n I had gone to take her to our home in response to a letter from Dr.\r\n Blackwell commending her to our care. The letter had come late the\r\n night before, and I had not realized the forlornness to her of being\r\n in a hotel over night in a strange city.\r\n\r\n How condemned I felt for this thoughtlessness as I looked into the\r\n tearful eyes of the lonely foreigner who did not feel at home in\r\n English, and who had found no one to greet her in her own language\r\n until I ventured my crude German! Her eyes kindled into smiles at that\r\n and our years of close friendship were begun.]\r\n\r\nI met with a most cordial reception in the college. The dean (Dr.\r\nJohn J. Delamater) received me like a father, and from the first day\r\nI felt perfectly at home. All was going on well. I had a home at Mrs.\r\nSeverance’s, and despite my mutilated English I found many friends in\r\nthe college, when suddenly circumstances changed everything.\r\n\r\nSome changes occurred in Mr. Severance’s business and he was forced\r\nin consequence to give up housekeeping. At that time I did not know\r\nthat the Physiological Society was ready to lend me money, and I was\r\ntherefore in great distress.\r\n\r\nI never experienced so bitter a day as that on which Mrs. Severance\r\ntold me that I could stay with her no longer. It was but five weeks\r\nafter my arrival, and I was not able to make myself understood in the\r\nEnglish language, which was like chaos to me. On the same day I well\r\nremember that for the first time in my life I made an unsuccessful\r\nattempt to borrow money; and because it was the first and the last\r\ntime, it was the more painful to me to be refused. I envied the dog\r\nthat lived and was happy without troubling his brain; I envied the\r\nkitchen-maid who did her work mechanically and seemed to enjoy life far\r\nmore than those fitted by nature for something higher.\r\n\r\nMrs. Severance secured a boarding place for me for the rest of the\r\nwinter and paid my board, amounting to thirty-three dollars, from the\r\nfunds of the society. I lived quietly by myself; studied six hours\r\ndaily at home, with four dictionaries by me; attended six lectures a\r\nday, and went in the evening for three hours to the dissecting rooms.\r\n\r\n [Dr. Blackwell, again writing to her sister Emily on November 13th,\r\n says: A pleasant circumstance occurred to my German, Dr. Zakrzewska.\r\n I arranged a Cleveland course for her, and she entered two weeks ago.\r\n She met a very friendly reception, and found that Dr. Kirtland is in\r\n correspondence with Professor Müller of Berlin, and he had mentioned\r\n her in some of his letters in such high terms that the faculty told\r\n her that if she would qualify herself for examination in surgery and\r\n chemistry and write an English thesis, they would graduate her at the\r\n end of this term. Of course, she is studying with might and main, and\r\n will, I have no doubt, succeed; so we may reckon on a little group of\r\n three next year. That will be quite encouraging.]\r\n\r\nI never conversed with any one at the boarding house, nor even asked\r\nfor anything at the table, but was supplied like a mute. This silence\r\nwas fruitful to me. About New Year, I ventured to make my English\r\naudible; when, lo! every one understood me perfectly. From this time\r\nforward, I sought to make acquaintances, to the especial delight of\r\ngood old Dr. Delamater who had firmly believed that I was committing\r\ngradual suicide.\r\n\r\nMy stay in that congenial family, the Severances, was meant to be\r\nonly temporary, until a suitable boarding house could be obtained.\r\nAlas, nobody wanted to take a “female medical student!” For several\r\nweeks, Mrs. Severance hunted for such a place until she found a New\r\nEngland woman, Mrs. Shepard, who was willing to brave the criticism\r\nof neighborhood and church connections and take me and another female\r\nmedical student who was in the same dilemma to board for the winter,\r\nthe Association mentioned making themselves responsible for the\r\nexpense.[3]\r\n\r\nBeing now well-housed, we trotted unconcernedly by neighbors staring\r\nfrom behind half-shut blinds, twice a day, to and from our college.\r\nAnd there being four women among a couple of hundred young men, we\r\nhad our box seat to ourselves, unmolested by the tobacco-chewing and\r\nspitting Æsculapians in embryo. My three companions were Mrs. Chadwick\r\nwho was my roommate, Miss Cordelia A. Greene, now practicing in her\r\nown institution in Castile, N. Y., and Miss Elizabeth Grissell, now a\r\npracticing physician in Salem, Ohio.[4]\r\n\r\nIn the college, we had nothing of which we could complain; the young\r\nmen did not like our presence; some of the professors acted as if we\r\ndid not exist, while others favored us in many ways; and one, the most\r\neminent, Dr. Delamater, offered to be my preceptor and gave me good\r\npractical advantages.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, life was made quite pleasant in the college, although we\r\nwere told that a strong petition was circulated by the male students to\r\nexclude women after that winter’s term. The faculty refused to consent\r\nto this request because they had given the four women the promise of an\r\nopportunity to graduate. However, the assurance was given to the men\r\nthat the college would not again admit women, especially as the faculty\r\nconsidered that the little Pennsylvania Medical College for Women was\r\nprospering and giving fully as good an education as the Western Reserve\r\nMedical College.\r\n\r\nWe did not see a copy of the petition of the men students, but as there\r\nwas never any variety in the objections made to the study of medicine\r\nby women, it was undoubtedly similar to the one which the medical\r\nstudents at Harvard College presented against the admission of Dr.\r\nHarriot K. Hunt, in 1850, and which she published in _Glances and\r\nGlimpses_.\r\n\r\nAs it is interesting because showing the weakness of the forces which\r\neverywhere opposed us, I will cite it here.\r\n\r\nAfter quoting a communication which approved of her conduct and\r\ndisapproved of that of the men students, and which appeared in the\r\n_Boston Evening Transcript_, July 5, 1851, Dr. Hunt adds: “This\r\narticle brought out the resolutions of the students which I had\r\nendeavored to obtain in vain.”\r\n\r\n THE FEMALE MEDICAL PUPIL.--Mr. Editor: As an article, in some\r\n respects imaginative, appeared in the _Transcript_ on Wednesday\r\n evening over the signature of _E. D. L._, who professes to be\r\n “well informed” respecting the application of a female to the Medical\r\n Lectures, and the “insubordination” with which the intelligence\r\n was received by the students, allow me to correct any erroneous\r\n impression by claiming space for an insertion of the following series\r\n of resolutions passed at a meeting of the medical class with but\r\n _one_ dissenting vote, and afterwards respectfully presented to\r\n the Faculty of the Medical College.\r\n\r\n WHEREAS, it has been ascertained that permission has been\r\n granted to a female to attend the Medical Lectures of the present\r\n winter, therefore,\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That we deem it proper both to testify our\r\n disapprobation of said measure, and to take such action thereon as\r\n may be necessary to preserve the dignity of the school, and our own\r\n self-respect.\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That no woman of true delicacy would be willing in\r\n the presence of men to listen to the discussion of the subjects that\r\n necessarily come under the consideration of the student of medicine.\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That we object to having the company of any female\r\n forced upon us, who is disposed to unsex herself, and to sacrifice her\r\n modesty, by appearing with men in the medical lecture room.\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That we are not opposed to allowing woman her rights,\r\n but do protest against her appearing in places where her presence is\r\n calculated to destroy our respect for the modesty and delicacy of her\r\n sex.\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That the medical professors be, and hereby are,\r\n respectfully entreated to do away forthwith with an innovation\r\n expressly at variance with the spirit of the introductory lecture,\r\n with our own feelings, and detrimental to the prosperity, if not to\r\n the very existence of the school.\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, That a copy of these resolutions be presented to the\r\n Medical Faculty.\r\n\r\n  SCALPEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe women in Cleveland were fortunate that we had to contend only with\r\nostracism and petitions, for in Philadelphia and in Edinburgh, women\r\nmedical students suffered grievously at the hands of the male medical\r\nstudents, as well as from other groups in the community.\r\n\r\nFor instance, at the commencement exercises of the Pennsylvania Female\r\nMedical College, prayer was offered by a layman because no minister in\r\nPhiladelphia could be found who would take part in the services.[5]\r\n\r\nAnd the Philadelphia County Medical Society not only refused to admit\r\nwomen physicians as members, but, in 1859, it pronounced an edict of\r\nexcommunication against any of its members who should teach in the\r\nPennsylvania Female Medical College, or who should consult with women\r\nphysicians or with the male teachers of the women. And this edict\r\nof excommunication was approved, in 1860, by the Pennsylvania State\r\nMedical Society. As a leading member of both societies, Dr. Atlee,\r\nexpressed it, “By the rules of our medical association, I dare not\r\nconsult with the most highly educated female physician, and yet I may\r\nconsult with the most ignorant masculine ass in the medical profession.”\r\n\r\nAgain, in _The Business Folio_, Boston, March, 1895, Mrs. Mary A.\r\nLivermore tells of a personal observation which she made during the\r\nearlier days of this college. Speaking to a relative, she says:\r\n\r\n Before you were born, and you are now nearly twenty-eight years old,\r\n my husband and myself went to Philadelphia to make your father and\r\n mother a visit.\r\n\r\n One day, we were walking up Chestnut Street when suddenly we became\r\n aware that something unusual was the matter. Before us was a group of\r\n women hurrying along in great confusion; they were well dressed, but\r\n their clothing was then in a very dilapidated condition.\r\n\r\n We wondered what had happened, and as we looked this way and that a\r\n chunk of mud flew by, perilously near my face, and hit one of the\r\n women who was then not far from us.\r\n\r\n With a startled cry, the woman with the others ran into the wide-open\r\n doors of a large store. They were followed by a company of young men\r\n seemingly intent only upon reaching them. The proprietor and clerks\r\n sprang to the rescue of the young women, and, with the help of my\r\n husband and his brother, grabbed the unmannerly cubs by the napes of\r\n their necks and threw them into the street.\r\n\r\n We then learned that the company of young women had entered one of the\r\n medical colleges in Philadelphia, and these young men from another\r\n college in another part of the city had determined that if they could\r\n prevent it no women should study medicine.\r\n\r\nThis Philadelphia episode suggests the mobbing and pelting with mud\r\nwhich Sophia Jex-Blake and her fellow women students received from the\r\nmale medical students at the gates of the University of Edinburgh as\r\nlate as 1870, but it lacks the compensating feature of the Edinburgh\r\noccurrence when “the decent male medical students” came to the rescue\r\nof the women and formed a protecting and chivalrous escort for them,\r\ncontinuing this gentlemanly course till the “rowdies” accepted\r\nthe presence of women students. Though this “presence” was only\r\nshort-lived.”[14]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I exchanged letters pretty regularly With Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell, telling her the details of my college life, and she telling\r\nme that she was obliged to close the little dispensary. One reason for\r\nthis was the lack of funds to meet the expense, while another was the\r\nlack of such assistance as I had rendered, Dr. Emily Blackwell being\r\nin Europe, studying, and there being no other medical woman to avail\r\nherself of the opportunity for such practice. She also wrote me that\r\nthe practice she sought increased but slowly while expenses were high,\r\nso she had decided to enter upon the new speculation of buying a house\r\non Fifteenth Street and reducing her own expenses by sharing its rooms\r\nwith friends.\r\n\r\nThe first three months of college life were rather dull for me, as my\r\nimperfect knowledge of the English language excluded me from taking\r\npart in the comradeship of the few male students who rather enjoyed the\r\npresence of the women, and who had taken no part in the petition of\r\nobjection to us.\r\n\r\nAfter college hours, my roommate and I spent our time chiefly in our\r\nroom as the other boarders would retire as soon as we entered the\r\nparlor; and at table would politely but decidedly manifest their\r\nintention to ignore us. On Sundays, we went to “Meeting,” as it was\r\ncalled, sometimes under the auspices of our good hostess, Mrs. Shepard,\r\nwho was a strict orthodox Presbyterian. More often, however, I went to\r\na hall where a small society known as that of the Liberal Christians\r\nwas addressed by Rev. A. D. Mayo. He was a humanitarian and belonged in\r\nthe ranks of the Abolitionists. He was also interested in various other\r\nsocial reforms, among which was the Woman’s Rights movement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n _Marie’s contact with “transcendentalism” and the Know-Nothing\r\n movement--Meets Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, of Boston--Why Harriot and her\r\n sister began to study medicine in 1830--In 1847, Harriot applies to\r\n Harvard for permission to attend medical lectures and is refused--In\r\n 1850, she renews her application and receives permission--Harvard\r\n medical students send two petitions of protest to the faculty: one\r\n against admission of negro men students; one against admission\r\n of women students--The faculty requests Harriot to withdraw her\r\n application--Marie’s father opposes her study of medicine, denounces\r\n her leaving “woman’s sphere” and demands her return to New York or to\r\n Germany. (Twenty-five years of age: 1854-1855.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nRetracing these later steps for a moment, I wish to add that the\r\nyears 1840 to 1860 form the period of what is now called the\r\n“transcendentalism of New England.” What has given rise to this mode of\r\nthinking and acting of the people has been explained by many an able\r\nwriter. I, arriving in America in 1853, experienced the effect of this\r\nphase of spiritual life when it was on the wane; when phalansteries had\r\nbeen tried and had failed; when social reforms were discussed in all\r\nparts of the country by those who led the van from Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, and Cleveland.\r\n\r\nGroups of reformers existed in the churches and schools as well as\r\nin political and social circles. Women, still timid and under the\r\npressure of social propriety, hailed every one who dared to give\r\nexpression to their wishes and longings for a sphere beyond that of\r\ndomesticity.\r\n\r\nThe broader religious preaching of William Ellery Channing and of\r\nTheodore Parker encouraged many to join these men in their efforts,\r\nwhile transcendental thinking and reading had prepared their minds to\r\naccept any new theory of life and its aims, for the individual woman as\r\nwell as for the whole sex.\r\n\r\nThe first impressions received from the few acquaintances I had, after\r\narriving, were depressing in the highest degree; for I found that the\r\nlife of the New World had not only confirmed my countrymen in their Old\r\nWorld prejudices but it had even a reactionary result upon their mode\r\nof thinking, leading them to ridicule the American ways and modes in\r\nsocial, religious and political forms of life.\r\n\r\nThe Know-Nothing party had just been established; and those immigrants\r\nwho were exiled after the revolutionary efforts of the years following\r\n1848, created a prejudice among themselves against the English-speaking\r\npeople of New York, especially against all reformers, which included\r\nthe Know-Nothings.\r\n\r\nAnd, yet, it was through the accidental acquaintance of these\r\nKnow-Nothings that I was introduced to the so-called reformers; and,\r\nstrange to say, the family giving firm adherence to the Know-Nothing\r\nprinciples was of German birth, their parents having emigrated after\r\nthe year 1830, when exiled following the student revolt.\r\n\r\nThis family opened the path to the first acquaintance to whom I could\r\nshow my credentials, verified by letters from the American Secretary of\r\nLegation at Berlin, Theodore S. Fay.[2]\r\n\r\nA new world seemed to appear before my eyes when I was first introduced\r\nto the different circles of reformers. It seemed to me then as if the\r\nwhole social and religious life was undermined, and that a labyrinth\r\nof ways ran confusedly in all sorts of directions. All that education,\r\nhabit and custom had nurtured in my perception of life seemed to\r\ncrumble into pieces.\r\n\r\nThat negro slavery was still in full force I soon learned, and that\r\nwomen declared their incapability to speak freely and openly against it\r\nshocked me beyond comprehension. On the other hand, I was shocked that\r\na Mrs. Wright and others had demanded the emancipation of women. That\r\na Woman’s Rights Convention was held in New York State seemed to me so\r\nridiculous that I found the expression in one of the New York papers,\r\n“The hens which want to crow,” quite appropriate.\r\n\r\nHowever, I had tried to crow as hard as any of these women without\r\nrealizing it, for I had been quite enthusiastic when I received the\r\nnews that ways and means had been found through the efforts of Dr.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell for me to enter the medical school of the Western\r\nReserve College, at Cleveland. It was not a week after my arrival when\r\nthrough a visit from Dr. Harriot Kezia Hunt to the house of my hostess\r\nand protector, Mrs. Caroline M. Severance, I learned to my great\r\nastonishment that the “crowing hens” of Cleveland had taken me under\r\ntheir wings to shelter me and to promote my efforts.[6]\r\n\r\n[As Marie became better acquainted with the “woman’s rights” question\r\nher logical mind was impressed by the arguments in favor of the\r\nmovement, and she eventually accepted it and became associated with\r\nits ardent advocates, though never herself taking the position of a\r\nmilitant suffragist.]\r\n\r\nA few details regarding Dr. Hunt will be of interest here. Harriot\r\nKezia Hunt and her sister, Sarah Augusta, had their minds withdrawn\r\nfrom their profession of teaching and turned towards medicine, in 1830,\r\nby the prolonged illness of Sarah and her ineffective treatment by the\r\nregular medical profession. “After forty-one weeks of sickness and\r\none hundred and six professional calls, my sister was roused to more\r\nthought on this subject. We talked it over together; she obtained some\r\nmedical works; and finally, she came to the conclusion that her case\r\nwas not understood.”\r\n\r\nThe sisters continued the study of medicine by themselves, and Harriot\r\nfirst thought of _woman_ as a _physician_ when, in 1833,\r\nMrs. Mott and her husband, two irregular practitioners who had come to\r\nBoston from England, were called to see if they could in any way help\r\nSarah. As Harriot writes: “... it did not occur to us that to die under\r\nregular practice, and with medical etiquette, was better than any other\r\nway.”\r\n\r\nSarah soon began to improve and Harriot then decided to become a\r\nphysician, giving up her teaching so that she might have more time\r\nto study. Sarah’s new treatment eliminated the rather drastic use\r\nof drugs then prevalent in medical practice, and confined itself\r\nprincipally to attention to the somewhat neglected laws of hygiene,\r\ncombined with cheering assurances of a cure. As her health became\r\nestablished, Sarah joined in the study, and in October, 1835, the two\r\nsisters formally began practice by advertising the fact in the daily\r\npapers. Sarah later married and became the mother of six children,\r\ngradually withdrawing from the practice which Harriot continued alone.\r\n\r\nHarriot persevered in her studies while building up a very successful\r\npractice in Boston, and, in 1847, she applied to Harvard College\r\nfor permission to attend medical lectures but was refused. In 1850,\r\nshe renewed her application and this time she received the desired\r\npermission, five of the seven members of the Faculty voting in the\r\naffirmative.\r\n\r\nOf the two men who voted in the negative (Drs. James Jackson and\r\nJacob Bigelow), it was Dr. Jackson who had introduced into Boston the\r\nmidwife, Mrs. Janet Alexander. “Thus,” comments Dr. Putnam-Jacobi, “it\r\nwould seem that his objection was not to women but to _educated_\r\nwomen who might aspire to rank among regularly educated men physicians.”\r\n\r\nBut again Dr. Hunt’s hopes met disappointment for, as noted in a\r\nprevious chapter, the men students sent to the Faculty two petitions of\r\nremonstrance--one against the admission of negro men students, and one\r\nagainst the admission of women students.\r\n\r\nThe Faculty referred these petitions to a committee of which Dr. Jacob\r\nBigelow (one of the two members originally voting against Dr. Hunt’s\r\nadmission) was chairman. This committee reported the following votes\r\nregarding the petition against women students (and this report was\r\naccepted):\r\n\r\n _Voted_, that the Faculty are at all times anxious to promote the\r\n gratification and welfare of the members of the medical class so far\r\n as their duty and the great interests of medical education permit.\r\n\r\n _Voted_, that the female student who had applied for liberty to\r\n attend the lectures having by advice of the Faculty withdrawn her\r\n petition, no further action on this subject is necessary.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Dr. Hunt received the honorary degree of M.D. from the Female\r\nMedical College of Pennsylvania, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nI found among those whom Mrs. Severance had interested in my behalf,\r\nkind and intelligent as well as sympathizing friends who were willing\r\nto assist me even financially in my studies. These good people, I saw\r\nwell, pitied my benightedness concerning the emancipation of women,\r\nwithout trying to proselyte, but leaving me in good faith that I would\r\nwork out my own salvation and see the righteousness of their demands\r\nfor a larger sphere for women.\r\n\r\nAnother tie of sympathy soon became apparent, namely, the religious\r\ntendency which was prevailing in the Severance circle of acquaintances.\r\nMr. and Mrs. Severance were the leading spirits of a small Universalist\r\ncongregation who held their meetings in the only public hall which\r\nCleveland then possessed. This assembly was inspired by Rev. A. D. Mayo\r\nwho had recently been called by them. They were adverse to Calvinism as\r\nwell as to Episcopalianism, yet they felt the want and need of some\r\nform of church union.\r\n\r\nThis congregation was the most heterogeneous imaginable. Most of\r\nthe people were in a transition stage from the darkest orthodoxy to\r\natheism, neither of these extremes satisfying their ideals. There were\r\nalso reformers in other directions dissatisfied with all existing\r\ncodes of religion and law who sought refuge in the companionship of\r\nmalcontents. Thus, we had not only Unitarians and Universalists to\r\nmeet, but also Spiritualists, Magnetists, Fourierists, Freelovers,\r\nWomen’s Rights advocates, Abolitionists--in fact, followers of all\r\nkinds of _isms_ then existing.\r\n\r\nEvery theory had its representatives and advocates when a couple of\r\ndozen men and women gathered in alternate houses, socially or for\r\ndiscussing problems in general. A woman medical student was a new\r\nelement and was welcomed by all the factions. Fortunately, I could\r\nnot speak the English language, so I belonged to the class of patient\r\nlisteners. I thus received attention from all groups, learning a great\r\ndeal of what was agitating the intelligent and thinking ones, and being\r\nbefriended by many in the expectation of swelling their numbers by one\r\nmore in support of their specific beliefs or theories.\r\n\r\nHowever, as these people seemed to be the only group of human beings\r\nwho were not afraid of female medical students, I decided to avail\r\nmyself of the customary opportunity of calling on New Year’s Day, 1855,\r\nat the house of Mr. Mayo, Mrs. Severance having inspired me with the\r\ncourage to do so. To my great surprise, after arriving there I found\r\nthat I could speak English well enough to be understood.\r\n\r\n [At a later date Mr. Mayo writes of this call:\r\n\r\n Among my visitors at my home in Cleveland, at the New Year’s reception\r\n of 1855, was a young woman whose face I recognized as a bright\r\n presence in the Sunday congregations that waited on my ministry.\r\n\r\n Despite her impossible Polish name and her picturesque pronunciation\r\n of the English language, she became at once the notable guest of the\r\n evening. Her cheerful voice, reinforced by her magnetic womanhood,\r\n sent every sentence to the right place and won our hearts.]\r\n\r\nMy roommate and fellow student, Mrs. Chadwick, refused to accompany\r\nme on this New Year’s call. Mr. Mayo was too liberal for her. Such is\r\nthe inconsistency of human nature; she herself did not hesitate to don\r\nthe robe of a reformer as medical student, yet she did not dare to\r\nspeculate on new theories in the realm of thought.\r\n\r\nThus the new year began very promisingly, as it opened to me the chance\r\nof entering somewhat into social relations which to my nature were\r\nabsolutely necessary in order to keep up my hopes and aspirations.\r\nBesides, this connection gave me the opportunity to observe the habits\r\nand customs of this new life, both in the intellectual and the domestic\r\nspheres, during the little time that I could spare from my studies.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1854, after deciding to go to Cleveland to resume my\r\nmedical studies, I wrote to my parents to tell them of my hopes and\r\naims. These letters were not received with the same pleasure with which\r\nthey had been written.\r\n\r\nMy father, who had encouraged me before my entrance upon a public\r\ncareer, was not only grieved by my return to my old mode of life but\r\ngreatly opposed to it, and manifested this in the strongest words in\r\nthe next letter that I received from him. My mother, on the contrary,\r\nwho had not been at all enthusiastic in the beginning, was rather glad\r\nto receive the news.\r\n\r\nAs I had left many good friends among the physicians of Berlin, my\r\nletters were always circulated, after their arrival, by one of their\r\nnumber who stood high in the profession; and, though I did not receive\r\nmy father’s approbation, he sent me several letters from strangers who\r\napproved my conduct, and who, after hearing my letters, had sent him\r\ncongratulations upon my doings in America.\r\n\r\nHow he received the respect thus manifested to him, you can judge from\r\na passage in one of his letters, which I will quote to you:\r\n\r\n I am proud of you, my daughter; yet you give me more grief than any\r\n other of my children. If you were a young man, I could not find words\r\n in which to express my satisfaction and pride in respect to your acts;\r\n for I know that all you accomplish you owe to yourself: but you are a\r\n woman, a weak woman; and all that I can do for you now is to grieve\r\n and to weep. O my daughter! return from this unhappy path. Believe me,\r\n the temptation of living for humanity _en masse_, magnificent\r\n as it may appear in its aim, will lead you only to learn that all is\r\n vanity; while the ingratitude of the mass for whom you choose to work\r\n will be your compensation.\r\n\r\nLetters of this sort poured upon me; and when my father learned that\r\nneither his reasoning nor his prayers could turn me from a work which\r\nI had begun with such enthusiasm, he began to threaten; telling me\r\nthat I must not expect any pecuniary assistance from him; that I would\r\ncontract debts in Cleveland which I should never be able to pay, and\r\nwhich would certainly undermine my prospects; with more of this sort.\r\n\r\nMy good father did not know that I had vowed to myself, on my arrival\r\nin America, that I would never ask his aid; and besides, he never\r\nimagined that I could go for five months with a single cent in my\r\npocket. Oh, how small all these difficulties appeared to me, especially\r\nat a time when I began to speak English! I felt so rich that I never\r\nthought money could not be had whenever I wanted it in good earnest.\r\n\r\nBut with the closing of the term, which occurred early in March,\r\nthe financial assistance in paying for my board ceased, and further\r\nprovision had to be made for my support.\r\n\r\nShortly before this period, a letter was received from my father\r\ndenouncing my leaving my sisters, my despising the sphere of woman, and\r\nmy entering upon a field which so entirely belonged to men; he demanded\r\nmy return to New York or to Germany and he utterly refused me any\r\nfinancial aid. After reading this letter to Mrs. Severance and asking\r\nher counsel, I retired to my room almost in despair.\r\n\r\nThat same evening, I attended a meeting which had been announced from\r\nall the pulpits and which was being held for the purpose of discussing\r\nhow to aid the Cherokee Indians. Representatives of this tribe were\r\nsojourning in Cleveland on the way to Washington in order to see the\r\nGreat White Father and to implore his help in their troubles.\r\n\r\nDuring this meeting, I resolved to follow my father’s advice and give\r\nup man’s sphere, and offer myself as one of the missionaries to the\r\nIndians for which the leader pleaded as so necessary to civilize the\r\nsquaws. Thus would I carry the working out of woman’s sphere to the\r\nwilderness of the Indian Territory. The next morning I told my decision\r\nto Mrs. Shepard, to my fellow students and to Mr. Mayo; and in the\r\nevening I began a letter to my sisters who were now well established,\r\nmy sister Anna having married a very estimable young man whose parents\r\nwere friends and neighbors of ours in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIf I had not been visited in the morning of the next day by Dr. Seelye,\r\na friend of my fellow student, Miss Greene, and an hour later by Mrs.\r\nSeverance, my fate as an Indian missionary would have been decided by\r\nthe arrival of the afternoon hour appointed for the meeting of all\r\nthose interested in the Indian troubles. However, these two friends not\r\nonly dissuaded me from any such change, but promised to provide in some\r\nway or other, means for my continuing my studies.\r\n\r\nDr. Seelye insisted on my first writing to Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell,\r\nshowing me that I was under special obligation to her. The Indians\r\nhad to leave before I received her reply. She was indignant at my\r\nproposition and requested me to return to New York immediately after my\r\ngraduation the middle of the next March.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n _During vacation months, Marie teaches German--Becomes working guest\r\n in family of Rev. A. D. Mayo--Meets many noted men and women--Her\r\n mother dies on the voyage to New York and is buried at sea--Marie\r\n returns to New York, visits Dr. Blackwell, and finds the Infirmary is\r\n still closed--She goes to Boston to visit Dr. Hunt--Meets the Grimké\r\n sisters--Learns of the New England Female Medical College--Meets\r\n William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips, and other\r\n noted people--Returns to Cleveland and becomes the guest of Mrs.\r\n C. Vaughan for her closing term at college--Meets Lyceum speakers,\r\n professors, political and social leaders, and literary men and women\r\n from various parts of the country. (Twenty-six years of age: 1855.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin a few days, there were found some pupils to whom I might teach\r\nGerman. There also came a proposition from Mrs. Mayo who was expecting\r\nher first baby within a very short time. The proposition was that I\r\nshould become a general member of the family, attending to her needs\r\nas well as aiding in the housekeeping, etc., till the arrival of her\r\nmother later in the spring.\r\n\r\nIn April, I removed my possessions into that hospitable house which\r\noffered its little to me who had less. Both Mr. and Mrs. Mayo were\r\nreally nervous invalids, and the troubles and trials of their position\r\nas anti-slavery advocates and religious reformers bore heavily upon\r\nthem and kept their purse lean. However, I had no personal needs\r\nfurther than my board, as my clothing was still good in spite of my two\r\nyears in America.\r\n\r\nI found many dear and valued friends during my residence in Cleveland,\r\nbut none to whom I am bound in lasting gratitude as to Mr. Mayo, who\r\noffered me his assistance when he learned that I was in need, my extra\r\nexpenses having swallowed up the little money that I had brought with\r\nme, so that I had not even enough to return to my sisters in New York.\r\nAs the minister of a small congregation advocating Liberal ideas, he\r\nhad a hard position in Cleveland, both socially and pecuniarily, yet he\r\noffered to share his little with me. I was forced to accept it, and I\r\nam now, and have always been, glad that I did so.\r\n\r\nNo one that has not had the experience can appreciate the happiness\r\nthat comes with the feeling that a rich man has not cast a fragment of\r\nhis superfluity towards you (and here let me remark that it is next to\r\nimpossible to find wealth and generosity go together in friendship),\r\nbut that the help comes from one who must work for it as well as the\r\nrecipient. It proves the existence of the mutual appreciation that is\r\nknown by the name of “friendship.” The apple given by a friend is worth\r\nten times more than a whole orchard bestowed in such a way as to make\r\nyou feel that the gift is but the superfluity of the donor.\r\n\r\nNow I was in my element: superintending a very inferior servant girl;\r\nproviding wholesome simple meals for the invalids; going three mornings\r\na week to an apothecary shop where a friendly man permitted me to\r\nassist him in his work, thus acquiring a knowledge of drugs and their\r\npreparation; going two mornings a week to my preceptor’s office to\r\nrecite in the usual manner; giving German lessons two afternoons a\r\nweek; spending one evening a week at meetings in houses of different\r\nparishioners for discussions on theological subjects, especially\r\nUnitarian and Universalist themes; assisting Mr. Mayo on Sundays at the\r\nSunday school, especially in organizing the same and in substituting\r\nfor absent teachers; and, after the arrival of the baby girl, taking\r\nexclusive charge of the delicate little being, trying to bring it up by\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nDuring this summer, I had the pleasure of getting acquainted with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Leander Lippincott (_Grace Greenwood_, a sister of Mrs.\r\nMayo). And later I met a great many renowned ministers and lecturers\r\nfrom the East who either called when passing through Cleveland or\r\nexchanged pulpits with Mr. Mayo, being our guests in either case. All\r\nthese gentlemen were highly interesting, especially when talking on\r\npolitics, the Free Soil movement and anti-slavery. My knowledge of\r\nAmerican civilization was in this way greatly increased and my powers\r\nof observation and meditation received full satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis quiet yet useful existence was broken by a letter from my father,\r\nbringing the news of his having sent my mother and the youngest two\r\nsisters to New York for a visit to us, with the intention of following\r\nthem himself as soon as he could obtain a year’s furlough with full\r\nsalary. All this was meant to see for himself whether I could not be\r\nbrought back to my senses and persuaded to return to the proper sphere\r\nof woman.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be of interest here to state that my only brother had\r\narrived in New York just before I left for Cleveland and had found a\r\ngood position as mechanical engineer. And a half-brother of my mother,\r\nwhom my father had adopted, had arrived after my departure. My father\r\nwanted to rescue these two from the fate of being soldiers in Germany,\r\nso he expatriated them, sending them to America. But in their new\r\ncountry, the former became a captain in the militia, while later,\r\nduring the war of the rebellion, the latter became a captain in the\r\nregular United States Army.\r\n\r\nShall I attempt to describe the feeling that overpowered me on the\r\nreceipt of these tidings? If I did, you never could feel it with me,\r\nfor I could not picture in words the joy I felt at the prospect of\r\nbeholding again the mother whom I loved beyond all expression, and who\r\nwas my friend besides; for we really never thought of each other in our\r\nrelation of mother and child, but as two who were bound together as\r\nfriends in thought and in feeling.\r\n\r\nNo, I cannot give you a description of this, especially as it was\r\nmingled with the fear that I might not have the means to go to greet\r\nher in New York before another ten months were over. Day and night,\r\nnight and day, she was in my mind; and from the time that I had a right\r\nto expect her arrival, I counted the hours from morning until noon, and\r\nfrom noon until night, when the telegraph office would be closed.\r\n\r\nAt length, on the eighteenth of September, the despatch came--not to\r\nme but to my friend Mr. Mayo--bearing the words,\r\n\r\n Tell Marie that she must calmly and quietly receive the news that our\r\n good mother sleeps at the bottom of the ocean, which serves as her\r\n monument and her grave.\r\n\r\nThis is the most trying passage that I have to write in this sketch\r\nof my life, and you must not think me weak that tears blot the words\r\nas I write. My mother fell a victim to seasickness which brought on a\r\nviolent hemorrhage that exhausted the sources of life. She died three\r\nweeks before the vessel reached the port, and my two sisters (the one\r\nseventeen, and the other nine years of age) chose rather to have her\r\nlowered on the Banks of Newfoundland than bring to us a corpse instead\r\nof the living. They were right, and the great ocean seems to me her\r\nfitting monument.\r\n\r\nThis news almost paralyzed me. It was impossible for me to remain in\r\nCleveland, I longed so to be with my sisters in New York. Availing\r\nmyself of the cheapness of an excursion to the eastern cities, I\r\nhastened to them, they being nicely established all in one house headed\r\nby my brother-in-law, Mr. A. C. ----.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shock of our mother’s loss had passed, I called upon my\r\nfriend, Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, who, though well established in her\r\nnewly acquired house, in East Fifteenth Street, could not speak very\r\nencouragingly as to practice. For entirely social reasons, people were\r\nafraid to employ a woman physician openly, although desirous and ready\r\nto consult her privately. Yet even this unsatisfactory practice had\r\nprevented her from continuing the little dispensary regularly and it\r\nwas still closed.\r\n\r\nBut, during my absence, she had been trying to interest some wealthy\r\nfriends in the collection of money to enable us after my return in the\r\nspring to commence again upon a little larger scale. To effect this,\r\nshe proposed to hold a Fair during the winter after my return, and we\r\nconcluded that the first meeting for this purpose should be held during\r\nmy visit in New York. She succeeded in calling together a few friends\r\nat her house, who determined to form a nucleus for a Fair Association\r\nfor the purpose of raising money for the New York Infirmary.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackwell’s experience was so contradictory to Dr. Harriot K.\r\nHunt’s statements of the Boston public (in which city a regularly\r\ngraduated medical woman from Cleveland, Dr. Nancy E. Clark, had also\r\nsettled) that I decided to avail myself of the fact that my excursion\r\nticket included Boston and to accept Dr. Hunt’s invitation for a visit\r\nof a few days in order to learn more of the opportunities of that city.\r\n\r\nArriving early one morning, I was conducted through winding streets\r\nfrom Exeter Place to Green Street to Dr. Hunt’s house, where I stayed,\r\nand where Mrs. Theodore Weld and Miss Sarah Grimké were engaged in\r\nediting Dr. Hunt’s autobiography, _Glances and Glimpses_, then in\r\nthe press.\r\n\r\nI was shown into a room in the third story, and as I was descending\r\nthe stairway soon afterward, my foot caught in the carpet in such a\r\nway that I fell head foremost down the stairs, striking against the\r\ndoor at the foot of the flight. The noise caused by this fall brought\r\nthe inmates of the room to the door where I lay unconscious. My period\r\nof unconsciousness was short, and on opening my eyes I saw a queerly\r\nshaped scarlet leg on each side of my head, and above these a short\r\ndrapery of the same bright color but with large flowers printed upon\r\nit, while from a beautiful, gentle and kind face encircled by soft\r\nwhite curls, came the words, “Are you hurt, my dear?” It was Mrs.\r\nAngelina Weld, in a bloomer dress of calico, and beside her was Miss\r\nSarah Grimké, in a Quakerlike costume, trying to disentangle me from\r\nthe position which I had assumed.\r\n\r\nThe picture made by the ladies was so amusing that a burst of mirthful\r\nlaughter brought me at once to my senses and to my feet, to the delight\r\nof these two charming ladies who became from that moment dear and\r\nintimate friends of mine.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunt introduced me to many fine people who consulted her\r\nprofessionally, and also to Dr. Nancy Clark, then established as a\r\nphysician in Boston. I observed that prejudice against women physicians\r\nwas by no means as strong as in New York or Cleveland.\r\n\r\nA school established in 1850, for the education and training of\r\n“midwives,” had been supported by Boston’s liberal-minded men and\r\nwomen. Some of the graduates of this school practiced very successfully\r\nas midwives. This school developed later into a medical school for\r\nwomen (New England Female Medical College), and was now giving legal\r\ndiplomas of “Doctor of Medicine.” The medical school was a small\r\nbut very respectably lodged concern, with correct and kind men for\r\nteachers, and with substantial prospects for getting a larger building\r\nand greater advantages for study within a year or two.\r\n\r\nHowever, the greatest event of my three days’ sojourn in Boston was\r\nmy introduction (through Mr. Mayo) to Mr. Theodore Parker, on Sunday\r\nevening, I having attended the morning’s service in Music Hall. Through\r\nMr. Parker, I met Mr. William Lloyd Garrison and Mr. Wendell Phillips,\r\nas well as a number of other prominent men and women. These three men\r\nwho were pictured so often in Cleveland as three ferocious lions, I\r\nfound gentle in manners, humanitarian in thought and word and earnest\r\nin purpose, possessors of great souls, feeling hearts and sincere\r\npatriotism. I was cordially welcomed by them and kept up this relation\r\nuntil the close of their lives, holding even a very honoring relation\r\nas professional adviser in their families.\r\n\r\nIt was a genial circle of friends, at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Parker,\r\nwho in their easy, informal manner of enjoying each other, impressed me\r\nas so utterly different from what I had heard of them, they having been\r\nrepresented by word of mouth as well as in print as the most dangerous\r\nand violent revolutionists.\r\n\r\nI remember the delicate and graceful figure of Miss Matilda Goddard,\r\nthe cordial Miss Hannah Stevens, Dr. William F. Channing and Mr. W. L.\r\nGarrison, as the center of groups in the spacious parlors, when the\r\ntalk was of religious and anti-slavery themes, with a frequent easy\r\nand cordial laugh at the expense of nobody.\r\n\r\nBefore returning to Cleveland, I received letters from Mrs. C. Vaughan,\r\na member of Mr. Mayo’s congregation, who was shocked to learn of our\r\ngreat bereavement in the death of our mother. She offered me a home for\r\nthe winter, with the kindest assurance that financial help might be\r\ngained by forming German conversational classes for the evenings.\r\n\r\nThus, on my return, I removed from Mrs. Mayo’s home, where my\r\nassistance had become unnecessary, owing to the death of the little\r\nbaby, to the hospitable mansion occupied by the Vaughan family and the\r\ndaughter, Mrs. G. Willey, and her husband.\r\n\r\nA few words as to the social and educational standing of this family\r\nwill be pardonable, especially as they were of so rare an occurrence\r\nat the time. Southerners by birth, they were yet opposed to slavery,\r\nhaving set their slaves free by bringing them to Cincinnati. Highly\r\ncultivated and talented as well as financially well-to-do, they\r\nunconcernedly became true reformers in many ways. The daughter, Mrs.\r\nWilley, wrote good Free Soil poetry, then needed by that movement;\r\nother members of the family developed their special talents as writers\r\nor musicians, while Mrs. Vaughan used her advantages for making\r\npropaganda by encouraging Lyceum lectures, which system was then in its\r\ninfancy. And she invited nearly all prominent speakers to stay at her\r\nhouse while in Cleveland.\r\n\r\nI thus saw and heard Dr. Harriet Kezia Hunt; Mr. and Mrs. George\r\nHildreth; Mrs. George Bradburn; Grace Greenwood; Rev. Henry Bond; Rev.\r\nMr. Mumford; Rev. Mr. Chapin; Ralph Waldo Emerson; Dr. W. Elder; Bayard\r\nTaylor; James Murdock, the actor; Frederick Douglass; Mr. John Giles,\r\nof the Lyceum lecture system; Rev. Starr King; prominent professors of\r\nthe Western Reserve College; and a number of leading _literati_ of\r\nthose times as well as men distinguished in politics, such as Speaker\r\nColfax, leader of the Free Soil party, and Secretary Salmon Chase,\r\nwho were holding political meetings. All these acquaintances were of\r\nincalculable use to me in this educational period. Although not able to\r\nconverse with them, I could observe and learn much that was of greatest\r\nimportance to my future.\r\n\r\nDiscussions pro and con on all kinds of subjects agitated the people,\r\nand more than once did I hear the “Boston Trio”--William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, Wendell Phillips and Theodore Parker--denounced as disturbers\r\nof Law and Order.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Vaughan’s untiring patience do I owe my acquiring the English\r\nlanguage as well as I was then capable of doing. I had to write\r\ntwo essays that winter, one being for an association formed by the\r\nmedical students, and one being my thesis. After having assisted me in\r\ncorrecting the grammar, Mrs. Vaughan made me read over each one four\r\ntimes, from ten to half-past eleven o’clock, for fifty evenings, until\r\nI got a good English pronunciation of which I was very proud.\r\n\r\nMy German conservatism was not a little startled when I found that\r\nhere also the so-called Woman’s Rights movement (the political\r\nenfranchisement of women) was heartily indorsed. Yet, in all the\r\nfamilies whose acquaintance I made from this social center, and who\r\nwere so different from those in the circles of Mrs. Severance and\r\nMr. Mayo, I soon recognized the same prejudice existing against all\r\nwomen who attempted to step out of the domestic sphere. In spite of\r\ntheir cultivation in literature and music and the fine arts generally,\r\nafter the completion of school life the women preferred a mere social\r\nactivity in their own surroundings and a Lady Bountiful attitude among\r\nthe poor belonging to their respective churches.\r\n\r\nI perceived so many contradictions in meeting with these evidently\r\nsuperiorly educated women. For instance, they abhorred the female\r\nmedical student and would not dare be seen with one of them in the\r\nstreets, and they considered themselves heroic for including me when\r\ninviting any of the Vaughan family to tea or to an evening gathering;\r\nyet, in discussing matters of politics, as Free Soilers or sympathizers\r\nwith anti-slavery, they manifested an independence of speech which\r\nshowed that they were well acquainted with the subject they discussed.\r\nIt was so, also, in spiritual and religious matters, in school affairs\r\nand in regard to pauperism. The women, young and old, held firmly to\r\ntheir intellectual convictions, and these might be for or against their\r\nfathers, brothers or husbands.\r\n\r\nIt astonished me to see how absolutely quietly and calmly discussions\r\nwere carried on, without bitterness or excitement, between opponents,\r\nand how respectfully men would listen to each other and to the women\r\nin particular, even when directly contradicted in their own views of\r\nthe case.\r\n\r\nIt was a great educational opportunity for me, broadening my whole\r\nnature which had been narrowed by the German school training of being\r\n_a subject_, first to the Government and next to Man.\r\n\r\nI was often taken by surprise when, on the brink of forgetting that\r\nthese manifestations of independence could exist side by side with the\r\nmost ludicrous prejudice against me and my medical companions, I would\r\nbe seriously questioned, “Do you want to turn women into men?”\r\n\r\nAnd when appearing in a church or meeting, we always noticed a\r\nsignificant withdrawal of all present so that we medical students could\r\nwalk or sit conspicuously by ourselves. This isolation which bordered\r\non ostracism when exposed to a limited multitude was very painful to\r\nbear, especially as we were young and at the time of life when the\r\n_amour propre_ of the individual would seek obscurity rather than\r\nnotoriety.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Blackwell only wished to open “legally” to women a field of\r\nlabor which was successfully cultivated by them “illegally,” because we\r\nfind that women were numerously employed to relieve pain and to combat\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThey appear, it is true, in the capacity of nurses only, but in this\r\nvocation their usefulness increased to such an extent that the name\r\n“Doctresses” was given to them, and their advice and help were sought\r\nby the educated and the ignorant, the rich and the poor, from far and\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nLegally, their position was not recognized. They maintained it either\r\nthrough their evident integrity of purpose or through shrewdness,\r\nmaking themselves as useful and as honored as the men physicians, who\r\nin reality were often superior to them only because the position of the\r\nmen was made secure by political laws made by the men and for the men.\r\n\r\nThus when, in the later forties, a woman claimed the right of gaining\r\nintellectual power, it appeared as if she stepped out of her sphere.\r\nAnd this claim, so simple and natural, was perverted by a hostile\r\nspirit into the claim that she wished “to become a man.”\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of this perverting and contaminating spirit, the\r\nsensitive were shocked by her demands; the indolent were vexed; and the\r\nwildest apprehensions were excited among both men and women.\r\n\r\nI can recall by name even, persons who went to see Miss Blackwell at\r\nthe college where she studied, really expecting to behold a woman on\r\nwhom a beard had developed, but who were surprised to find a most\r\nwomanly woman, delicate in size and figure, timid and reserved in\r\nmanners, and modest in speech.\r\n\r\nAgreeably disappointed in her, proud of her ability, and anxiously\r\nwishing her success in all her desires and enterprises, they yet did\r\nnot dare to invite her to their houses or to request an introduction to\r\nher, from fear that they might meet her on the streets and be forced to\r\nrecognize her in the presence of others.\r\n\r\nTo associate with or to employ a “doctress” famous merely for common\r\nsense, was perfectly respectable and honorable, but to seek the\r\nacquaintance of a woman who wished to enter “legally” upon the same\r\nwork which these doctresses performed was considered of very doubtful\r\nrespectability.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was that my three fellow students withdrew entirely\r\ninto their own abodes and devoted themselves to their professional\r\nwork. This I could not possibly do. I had to persevere and get\r\nacquainted with all phases of American life in order to become what I\r\nhad always hoped to be, an assistant organizer in the development of\r\nthe medical education of women.\r\n\r\n“The Emancipated Woman!” That was the horror of the day, in social\r\nlife as well as in the press. And woe to those women who perhaps\r\nthrough lack of physical beauty, or through want of taste in dress, or\r\nthrough a too profound seriousness, did not observe all social graces\r\nin detail. They became objects of criticism in private and in public.\r\nExaggerated descriptions and accounts of their every word and act, as\r\nwell as impertinent and ridiculous delineations, came forth in speech\r\nand in print for the amusement of all those who wished to stagnate\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nNobody could or would believe that in so few years the admission of\r\nthe right of women, as “human beings,” to do that for which they felt\r\nbest fitted would lead to the acceptance of the presence of women in\r\nall branches of human activity; and not only this, but that these\r\nwomen would be respected and honored, and appointed to positions of\r\nresponsibility hitherto filled only by men. And, again, that the\r\nnumber of positions calling for them would be greater than the number\r\nof women available, thus proving that there is no danger that all women\r\nwill desert their natural sphere as wives and mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n _Interesting adventure leading to acquaintance with Ralph Waldo\r\n Emerson--Marie receives the degree of M.D.--The faculty presents\r\n her, as a gift, with the note which she had given in payment for her\r\n lecture fees--Reflections: direct benefit which the men students\r\n derived from co-education; tribute to her college teachers, especially\r\n Drs. Delamater and Kirtland. (Twenty-six years of age: 1856.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThis second year of my stay in Cleveland was therefore a most valuable\r\nepisode of my life, turning all my views topsy-turvy, uprooting me, so\r\nto say, from all German conservatism and throwing me into this chaotic\r\nmedley of contradictions.\r\n\r\nHowever, the one straight aim of preparing myself for the examinations\r\nleading to a medical diploma kept me from any alarming detour in my\r\nprogress of evolution, and the year closed without any other than\r\nthe usual events in the course of life, as, for instance, the birth\r\nof a nephew which arrived in December and which I superintended, my\r\nbrother-in-law defraying my expenses to and from New York.\r\n\r\nBut I did have one very interesting adventure. And one daughter,\r\nVirginia Vaughan, who had been really the means of my being asked to\r\nbecome the guest of the house, was the leader in this. Mr. Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson had lectured in Cleveland and he was as usual a guest of Mrs.\r\nVaughan; she had been his pupil when a young lady and at school in\r\nBoston and quite an intimacy existed between them. From Cleveland, Mr.\r\nEmerson went to Hudson, ten miles away, the real seat of the Western\r\nReserve College, and he was advertised to lecture there at six in the\r\nevening.\r\n\r\nVirginia, anxious to hear Mr. Emerson again, came to the medical\r\ncollege which closed at four in the afternoon, and proposed our going\r\nto Hudson on the half-past four o’clock train to return on the one\r\nleaving there at nine. On arriving at the Hudson lecture hall, we found\r\na notice posted on the door informing the public that the lecture would\r\nbe at seven o’clock.\r\n\r\nWe went back to the station intending to return to Cleveland and there\r\nwe found there was no train until the one at nine o’clock. The station\r\nwas a crude, cold room, having only an insignificant little stove, so\r\nVirginia proposed that we find Mr. Emerson who, she knew, was at the\r\nhouse of his cousin, Professor Emerson, a member of the college faculty.\r\n\r\nIt was a cold, bitter day with plenty of snow everywhere, so we could\r\ndo nothing better than seek the house of the Professor. There we were\r\nmade so cordially welcome by Mrs. Emerson that we forgot even our very\r\nimproper appearance in our common everyday working attire. These kind\r\nhosts would not allow us to return in that last train but telegraphed\r\nto the family in Cleveland of our whereabouts, insisting that we remain\r\nwith them over Sunday, there being no trains till Monday morning at\r\neight o’clock.\r\n\r\nThat evening, after returning from the lecture and while partaking of a\r\ncup of hot tea, we noticed a bright rosy light upon the parlor windows.\r\nThinking it was an exhibition of “northern lights,” we all started for\r\nthe door. Alas! it was a great conflagration of magnificent hues of\r\ndark red flame.\r\n\r\nWe went to see the spectacle from a little hill between the house and\r\nthe fire where hundreds of people were already assembled, all of whom\r\nwere warmed and pleased by the wonderful flames, without any one making\r\nany effort to extinguish them or to try to prevent their spreading from\r\nthe burning cheese storehouse to the adjacent factory. Mr. Ralph Waldo\r\nEmerson asked in astonishment of the men standing nearest, “Why don’t\r\nyou try to extinguish the fire?” One replied in a very phlegmatic way,\r\n“Because we have no firemen or machines.” While another added, “Even if\r\nwe had, there would be no use for them as we have no water.” The little\r\ntown of Hudson, with its pretty streets and with a college aspiring to\r\nbecome soon a university, was without water. This seemed impossible to\r\nbelieve, yet it was true, as Professor Emerson assured us.\r\n\r\nThis night will always remain a memorable one, for independently of\r\nthat glorious illumination of the snow-covered city and landscape\r\nwhich was so fearful and yet so wondrously beautiful, it gave me an\r\nopportunity to get acquainted with one of the greatest philosophers\r\nof our times. This opportunity was well used during the Sunday\r\nmorning when all but Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson and myself went to\r\nchurch, I having no suitable clothes for such attendance. This short\r\nacquaintance gave rise to the many kind and pleasant words to people\r\nwith which Mr. Emerson favored me in later years, and to a very\r\ninteresting friendship with members of Professor Emerson’s family\r\nresiding in New York and Boston.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1855-1856, my life in Cleveland became doubly\r\ninteresting because I began to speak English and thus was able to\r\nmanifest my appreciation of the delightful impressions which I\r\nreceived, directly and indirectly, through the channels outside of my\r\nmedical studies.\r\n\r\nHow often was I surprised by the doubts of these more or less radical\r\nreformers concerning the success of women as medical practitioners.\r\nOnly Ralph Waldo Emerson spoke rationally about the innovation of\r\nwomen physicians; yet he doubted that women would enter upon any other\r\nprofession except that of teaching.\r\n\r\nHaving spent Christmas in New York with my sisters and the family, who\r\nenjoyed the newly arrived baby as only the first one can be enjoyed, I\r\nreturned to my college life with new zest, and I now had the extra task\r\nto perform of writing my thesis for examination.\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day, 1856, was cold and windy and brought a snowstorm. The\r\nlake opposite the house presented a sad and terrible aspect in the\r\npresence of an icebound schooner with several dead sailors covered\r\nwith ice and hanging in its rigging. Attempts to reach the vessel in\r\nsmall boats had failed, and a number of sturdy, sympathizing men were\r\nstanding on the shore discussing plans for relief that still might be\r\ngiven to some unseen fellow beings on board.\r\n\r\nAs the day was no holiday, I, of course, had to go to college. But it\r\nwas a bitter day. I thought my first winter in Cleveland was a severe\r\none, but this was cruelly so and it continued till late in March.\r\n\r\nThe first ten weeks of the year were spent very industriously by me in\r\npreparing to pass my examinations, after my thesis was accepted. The\r\nlatter was considered exceptionally good, and was the cause of my not\r\nfailing as a candidate for a diploma, because I received only mediocre\r\nmarks in all the branches of study, even falling below the passing mark\r\nin one branch.\r\n\r\nI wish to make a statement of this fact here for many good reasons.\r\nOne is, that it shows the utter absurdity of giving marks or numbers\r\nat all, for independently of my being still very awkward in English\r\nexpressions, I was, and still am, very slow in thinking out any subject\r\nand I have a very poor mechanical memory.\r\n\r\nAmong my three companions I was very much liked when discussing or\r\nreasoning out problems of our studies, often systematizing what seemed\r\nto us chaotic on a first reading. They often made me the “quizzer,” and\r\nI was not a little ashamed to hear with what readiness they gave names\r\nand relations of organs, knowing how impossible it would be for me to\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nBut when it came to practical deductions or applications they always\r\nrelied upon me. I enjoyed the confidence of those professors with whom\r\nI had practical instruction, and I had always out-patients on hand\r\nto look after. For this latter, my companions felt they had no time,\r\nsitting and committing to memory their lessons, and only one of them\r\nhad had any practical work in that she had lived in a “water-cure”\r\nestablishment.\r\n\r\nI envied my three friends not a little when I found they graduated with\r\nfull marks and high honors. However, the desired diploma of “M.D.” was\r\nalso awarded to me. I felt grateful for it, intending to make the most\r\nconscientious use of the power thus given to me and which I felt I\r\nfully deserved, as I could not help judging my medical knowledge to be\r\nas complete as that of any one of the forty-two graduates.\r\n\r\nAnd it is for this reason, also, that I condemn the method of judging\r\nof the ability or competence of any student simply from questions and\r\nanswers. So much knowledge can be acquired by storing the memory with\r\nall sorts of details, without making one’s self fit to digest what\r\nis learned and to assimilate even a part of it. But how necessary is\r\nthis latter when one is called upon to help all sorts of conditions\r\nin people who seek advice for physical, mental or moral ailments.\r\nAnd a physician, in the full sense of the word, must be qualified to\r\nhelp human nature from these three points of view. The mere studying\r\nand learning by heart of the symptoms of diseases, and of the origin,\r\npreparation and doses of drugs, ought to be the last chapter to be\r\nexamined upon.\r\n\r\nMy private studies in which examinations would have given much\r\nmore satisfactory results, were “biology,” “cellular anatomy” and\r\n“comparative anatomy,” in none of which subjects had we any instruction\r\nin the college. And it is my opinion that the medical profession will\r\nnot, and cannot, make medicine a science as long as these branches\r\n(in both their physiological and pathological forms) are not studied\r\nprofoundly and made a foundation upon which to build methods for\r\naverting or controlling disease. So long as physicians are taught to\r\ntalk of “curing disease,” so long will the whole profession wander in\r\nthe realm of empiricism, if not outright quackery.\r\n\r\nIt may be excusable that I thus use myself in illustrating what I\r\nthink is so pernicious, namely, cramming the memory with learning\r\nisolated facts and filling the brain to its fullest capacity with the\r\nnames of authors and their opinions, leaving no room for individual\r\nreasoning or research or for the power of making original deductions\r\nand applications.\r\n\r\nAfter this apparent digression, I must return to my theme, namely,\r\nthe last few weeks of my student life in Cleveland. As I have already\r\nstated how distrustful the so-called “good society” was concerning\r\nfemale medical students and how ready the so-called “reformers” were to\r\nseek them, I must here mention a peculiar aberration which had taken\r\nhold of the whole community. I refer to what was then called Mesmerism.\r\nThe individual thinking and theorizing on this subject assumed with\r\nmany persons a perfectly preposterous form. The views held were based\r\non no scientific research or study but simply on memorizing what was\r\npublished (often after the most superficial observation) regarding\r\nhysterical or somnambulistic manifestations.\r\n\r\nThe faith with which statements of so-called “cures” in all sorts of\r\nillnesses were received was just as widespread as that which later\r\naccepted Clairvoyance, Hypnotism and Christian Science. These, one\r\nafter the other, followed the Mesmerism and Magnetism waves; but they\r\nare all precisely the same thing, under other names, and they are\r\nall more or less influenced by what is called Spiritualism. And the\r\ncountless “miracle” workers, under a host of names, are all of the same\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nThe desire for the assistance of superrational influences is one of\r\nthe greatest obstacles which the human mind has to overcome. It will\r\ntake centuries of education before the majority of thinking beings will\r\nlearn that a cell will produce only its like, that modifications of the\r\ncell are produced only after a time of slow and, as yet, imperceptible\r\nchanges, and not suddenly by prayer or personal magnetism.\r\n\r\nOne of the most perplexing phenomena which I observed was that educated\r\nmen themselves became victims of these delusions. For instance, I knew\r\na professor of botany who was so completely absorbed in the phenomena\r\nof _Spiritualism_ and _Magnetism_ that he submitted himself\r\nto treatment by these uneducated pretenders for an ailment produced by\r\nmalaria. It is sometimes almost discouraging to see that even education\r\nwill not prevent faith in the superrational or supernatural.\r\n\r\nBut the Earth has billions and billions of years to live, and at the\r\nrate of mental development as we have observed it, I have no doubt\r\nthat the human intellect will grow out of its present infantile\r\ncondition into a maturity of which even the present generations have\r\nno conception, although, unconsciously, we all assist in nursing the\r\nembryo of intelligence which we call “knowledge” and “science.”\r\n\r\nOne may dream of the greatness of the human mind when all the\r\ninhabitants of the earth will be as well-developed mentally as the few\r\nout of the billions are to-day. One may imagine that the lowest of the\r\nPygmies in mid-Africa or the stupidest Esquimaux near the North Pole\r\nwill be able to think, to reason and to enjoy, as much as I do now; and\r\nthat the then great minds will work and struggle to bring up in the\r\nscale such poor ignorant mortals as those of my present level, these\r\nthen existing by the billions as we have the billions of illiterate\r\nexisting to-day.\r\n\r\n[Walt Whitman had a similar thought, and it is interesting to compare\r\nher and his expression of it, remembering the difference between prose\r\nand poetry, and the obstruction to expression caused by a foreign\r\ntongue which never became easy to her. In “Leaves of Grass,” he says:\r\n\r\n  This day before dawn I ascended a hill and looked at the crowded\r\n    heaven,\r\n  And I said to my Spirit, _When we become the enfolders of those\r\n    orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of everything in them, shall\r\n    we be filled and satisfied then?_\r\n  And my Spirit said, _No, we but level that lift to pass and continue\r\n    beyond._]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1856, the great event took place. On Commencement Day,\r\nforty-two students, four of whom were women, received the degree of\r\n“M.D.” The hall in which the exercises took place was crowded, not only\r\nwith friends of the graduates but with a goodly number of the curious\r\nof the city who had come to get a look at the women doctors. A deep\r\nsilence prevailed after the president had alluded to the female portion\r\nof the students, and the dropping of a pin might have been heard when\r\none after the other, according to alphabetical arrangement, they\r\nstepped up to the platform, each to receive her roll of parchment. No\r\nsign for or against them was made and all went home in a dull, somber\r\nmood.\r\n\r\nThe doors of the college had closed behind us, and the words of advice\r\nto “go out and do honor to your chosen profession” with which the whole\r\nevent had concluded, rang in my ears, though I had not the slightest\r\nidea how to realize them.\r\n\r\nShortly after Commencement, the dean of the college (Dr. Delamater)\r\ncalled upon me. A call from this venerable gentleman was a thing so\r\nunusual that numberless conjectures as to what this visit might mean\r\nflitted through my brain on my way to the parlor. He received me, as\r\nusual, paternally, wished me a thousand blessings, and handed back to\r\nme the note for one hundred and twenty dollars, payable in two years,\r\nwhich I had given for the lecture fees. He told me that in the meeting\r\nof the faculty after graduation day, it was proposed by one of the\r\nprofessors to return the note to me as a gift. To this, those present\r\ncheerfully gave a unanimous vote, adding their wishes for my success\r\nand appointing Dr. Delamater as their delegate to inform me of the\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nThis was a glorious beginning, for which I am more than thankful, and\r\nfor which I was especially so at that time when I had barely money\r\nenough to return to New York, with very small prospects of getting\r\nmeans wherewith to commence practice. The mention of this fact might\r\nbe thought indiscreet by the faculty in Cleveland were they still so\r\norganized as to admit women, which I am sorry to say is no longer the\r\ncase, though they give as their reason that women at present have their\r\nown medical colleges and, consequently, no longer have need of theirs.\r\n\r\nBefore I quit the subject of the Cleveland College, I must mention a\r\nfact which may serve as an argument against the belief that the sexes\r\ncannot study together without exerting an injurious effect upon each\r\nother. During the last winter of my study, there was such emulation in\r\nrespect to the graduating honors among the candidates for graduation,\r\ncomprising thirty-eight male and four female students, that all studied\r\nmore closely than they had ever done before--the men not wishing\r\nto be excelled by the women, nor the women by the men. One of the\r\nprofessors afterwards told me that whereas it was usually a difficult\r\nthing to decide upon the best three theses to be read publicly at the\r\nCommencement, since all were more or less indifferently written, this\r\nyear the theses were all so good that it was necessary, to avoid doing\r\nabsolute injustice, to select thirteen from which parts should be read.\r\n\r\nDoes not this prove that the stimulus of the one sex upon the other\r\nwould act favorably rather than otherwise upon the profession? And\r\nwould not the very best tonic that could be given to the individual be\r\nto pique his _amour propre_ by the danger of being excelled by one\r\nof the opposite sex? Is not this natural, and would not this be the\r\nbest and the surest reformation of humanity and its social condition,\r\nif left free to work out its own development?\r\n\r\nOn the day following the visit of Dr. Delamater, I received a letter\r\nfrom my brother-in-law in which he told me that his business compelled\r\nhim to go to Europe for half a year, and that he had, therefore, made\r\narrangements for me to procure money, in case that I should need it to\r\ncommence my practice. He said that he intended to assist me afterwards,\r\nbut that as he thought it best for my sister (his wife) to live out of\r\nNew York during his absence, he was willing to lend me as much money\r\nas I required until his return. I accepted his offer with infinite\r\npleasure, for it was another instance of real friendship. He was by\r\nno means a rich man but was simply in the employ of a large importing\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBy giving lessons in German, I had earned a little money that served\r\nto cover my most necessary expenses. For the last months that I spent\r\nin Cleveland, I carried in my purse one solitary cent as a sort of\r\ntalisman, firmly believing that some day it would turn into gold; but\r\nthis did not happen, and on the day that I was expecting the receipt of\r\nthe last eighteen dollars for my lessons, which were designed to bear\r\nmy expenses to New York, I gave it to a poor woman in the street who\r\nbegged me for a cent, and it doubtless ere long found its way into a\r\nginshop.\r\n\r\nThe twenty months that I spent in Cleveland were chiefly devoted to the\r\nstudy of medicine in the English language, and in this I was assisted\r\nby most noble-hearted men. Dr. Delamater’s office became a pleasant\r\nspot and its occupants a necessity to me. On the days that I did not\r\nmeet them, my spirits fell below zero.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the pecuniary distress from which I constantly suffered,\r\nI was happier in Cleveland than ever before or since. I lived in my\r\nelement, having a fixed purpose in view and enjoying the warmest tokens\r\nof real friendship. I was liked in college, and though the students\r\noften found it impossible to repress a hearty laugh at my ridiculous\r\nblunders in English, they always showed me respect and fellowship in\r\nthe highest sense of the terms.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving the degree of “M.D.” and leaving the college behind me,\r\nit seems quite right to stop for a few moments and cast a retrospective\r\nglance at my own situation, objectively. I wonder whether any one can\r\njustly claim that one has always followed a well-laid plan in life, or\r\nwhether conditions and environment do not mold our actions, sustain our\r\nfirmness and fortify our persistence in following or working towards a\r\npositive aim.\r\n\r\nI do not think that in youth the individual shapes the _modus\r\noperandi_ of any undertaking. In spite of having a vague idea, or\r\neven a strong desire to carry into effect such an idea, environment\r\nas well as outside influences must come to the aid, in order to keep\r\nalive and to nourish the hope that his preconceived idea or desire\r\ncan ever be realized. Without such assistance, the young aspirant can\r\neasily be diverted and led into spheres of action not intended or\r\ndesired in the first instance.\r\n\r\nAfter we become older, we may honestly imagine that we followed a\r\nregularly planned course in life, when we really lived simply according\r\nto whatever chances from time to time molded or influenced our activity.\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1850 to March, 1856, it now seems to me that no\r\ndefinite plan determined my action, and that all that guided me was the\r\nstrong desire to make for myself “an independent livelihood” and to\r\nassist all persons who felt that same strong desire.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I was tempted to change my field of work so as to\r\nobtain this independence. For instance, in Berlin, after leaving the\r\nCharité Hospital, offers were made to me by eminent physicians to take\r\ncharge of private hospitals which were then beginning to be started,\r\nespecially for surgery. I did not accept these offers, partly because\r\nthey again placed me in dependence and partly because surgery had been\r\ndistasteful to me as it was then practiced, without anesthetics, the\r\nuse of neither ether nor chloroform having become general.\r\n\r\nSo, as we reason from the concrete to the abstract, I doubt that any\r\none, man or woman, can stand up and declare that one has achieved\r\nexactly what one hoped to achieve when entering upon the battlefield of\r\nactive life. There is no doubt that an intrinsic fitness for a certain\r\nkind of activity guides us towards such influences as we need to\r\ndevelop this fitness, but that is all.\r\n\r\nIt is for this reason, perhaps, that I never married, although educated\r\nand trained with the idea that the true sphere of woman is to be a\r\nwife and mother. Also, I was very sentimentally inclined towards men,\r\nto moonlight walks and to the exchange of friendly letters; but I\r\nalways grew tired of it all in a very short time and decided that none\r\nof these attachments was the right one, proving that my desire for\r\nindependence was innate. So, happy the man who got released from me and\r\nhappy was I to remain free.\r\n\r\nAgain, after arriving in New York, I might just as well have become a\r\nmanufacturer, as I had begun to be, if I had become familiar with the\r\nEnglish language. I was quite happy in that branch of work and was\r\nable to assist many a woman in various ways. But the impossibility of\r\nacquiring the language in that limited sphere prevented the enlargement\r\nof my knowledge and connections necessary in that branch of activity.\r\n\r\nThen later came, last but not least, the temptation to go as missionary\r\nto the Cherokee Indians. I have not a doubt that in that direction I\r\ncould have developed my independence and have been extremely useful,\r\nhad I not been influenced by people in whose judgment I had full\r\nconfidence--a rare thing in young, impulsive, enthusiastic natures, to\r\naccept the advice of others. I was bridled and held in check, not by a\r\nclear vision but by influences which overpowered me as the magnet does\r\nthe iron which it attracts.\r\n\r\nAlso, do I consider it fair and right and not out of place to speak of\r\nthe lecturers and teachers connected with the medical department of the\r\nWestern Reserve College. At the time as well as in the following years,\r\nI often heard depreciatory remarks about our professors and their\r\nmethods of instruction.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt that a very few of the students in attendance had\r\na collegiate education superior to that which some of the professors\r\nmight have had in their younger days, for instance, Dr. John J.\r\nDelamater, then over seventy years old, and Dr. J. B. Kirtland, not far\r\nfrom seventy, both of them the kindest of men, true philanthropists and\r\nmen of a natural genius who had attained a high position among their\r\nfellow men.\r\n\r\nThey had had, perhaps, less advantages in booklearning when young, yet\r\nthey had the power of inspiring youth to a higher and more thorough\r\nstudy, and their influence in developing the thinking powers of the\r\nstudents was something remarkable. Originality of thought, reasoning\r\nand deduction was the example given to us by them. And the form of\r\ntheir teachings was not so much memorizing prescribed methods as the\r\nteaching of the students how to observe closely all the phenomena of\r\nthe case of illness in question and how to study the smallest details,\r\nphysical, mental and moral, in order to find the primary cause. Such\r\ninstruction can never be gained from books, although medical literature\r\nhas now begun to attempt it. Many of the students ridiculed the hints\r\nand directions given, while to others they were the inspiration for\r\ndeeper study even after the degree was obtained.\r\n\r\nI know it was so in my case, and works like Kölliker’s _Comparative\r\nAnatomy_, later Virchow’s _Cellular Pathology_, and works on\r\nbiology, embryology and histology became really the foundation upon\r\nwhich I built my practice, taking little heed of recommendations of how\r\nto treat cases or how to administer doses of this or that old or new\r\nremedy or system of remedies. I did my own reasoning, I made my own\r\ndeductions, in as logical a method as possible as the cases revealed\r\nthemselves to my understanding through physical or psychical symptoms.\r\nOriginality and spontaneity of mental action are injured by unthinking\r\ncramming of mind and memory with booklearning.\r\n\r\nIt is for these reasons that I love to think, with gratitude and a deep\r\nfeeling of honor, of the men who then constituted the medical faculty,\r\nalthough two of them were greatly annoyed by the presence of the four\r\nwomen students and did not hesitate to manifest their feelings in word\r\nand deed, without being offensive.\r\n\r\nIndeed, even this feeling that our presence was objectionable was of\r\nuse in our training, as it gave us a strong foretaste of the prejudice\r\nwhich we were to meet in our professional lives. And it helped us in\r\nmany ways to develop the courage which we were to need in meeting the\r\noffensive behavior of many physicians and students with whom we were\r\nobliged to come in contact when trying to seek fellowship in private\r\npractice, or to increase our knowledge, or to gain admittance to public\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n _Returns to New York to begin practice as an M.D.--Insuperable\r\n difficulties encountered by a woman physician in finding an office\r\n to rent in New York--Dr. Zakrzewska opens her office in one of Dr.\r\n Blackwell’s parlors--No admission for women to dispensaries or\r\n hospitals--Infirmary remains closed for lack of money--Dr. Zakrzewska\r\n meets Mary L.

I dreaded the\r\nobstacles which I saw and felt were before me and which I must conquer.\r\nI fully felt the isolated social position which we four women medical\r\nstudents had occupied in Cleveland. My three companions, belonging\r\nto the orthodox church and disapproving of each and every subject\r\ndiscussed in Mr. Mayo’s congregation, had absolutely no outside\r\nrecreation, “even of the body,” and were shunned even in the boarding\r\nhouse by the inmates there, where we had found an otherwise comfortable\r\nhome during the first winter, in 1854.\r\n\r\nI realized the opposition to women physicians still more after I\r\nhad learned to speak English. Strange to say, this was far stronger\r\namong women than among men in and outside of the profession. My\r\ndiscouragement grew the stronger the nearer the end of my stay in\r\nCleveland approached.\r\n\r\nFollowing Commencement Day, a tremendous snowstorm was the first event\r\nwhich blockaded my next movements; for days no trains could pass the\r\nroads; the last quarter of my lessons in German had ended on March 1;\r\nmy packing made little demand on my time and it was finished. I had\r\nno special interests to keep me longer in Cleveland, and I began to\r\nconsider this calamity of snow a bad omen when Mr. Willey brought home\r\nthe news that, in a roundabout way and by changing trains four times, I\r\nmight be able to reach New York in thirty-six hours.\r\n\r\nSo I started off and I had really a most tedious journey, suffering\r\ngreatly from the cold before I reached my family, after forty hours in\r\ntrains, and finding New York just getting free from the snow blockades\r\nof the streets.\r\n\r\nThe welcome at my sisters’ was cordial. The one next in age to me\r\nhad taken a position in a large wholesale millinery establishment,\r\nreceiving a good salary, while the next younger one superintended the\r\nhousehold, and the youngest attended school. We were all hoping that\r\nour father would get his furlough for a visit and counsel as to what\r\nto do next with the family. Both brothers had gone to the Far West,\r\nseeking their own fortunes as brothers usually do.\r\n\r\nAlthough our father sent financial aid to the two younger sisters,\r\neighteen and eleven years old, I had no hope of such assistance from\r\nhim, and I could not settle down with the family because they resided\r\nin Hoboken, New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThis was too far distant from Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell as well as from\r\nthe center of the poor among whom it was necessary to seek patients.\r\nI felt the necessity of familiarizing myself with general practice in\r\nwhich I had had but very slight training. No clinical instruction was\r\nattempted in college, all students depending upon the private practice\r\nof their preceptors for this kind of teaching. We women students had\r\nreceived scarcely any such opportunities, as even our kind and beloved\r\nDr. Delamater could not often venture upon such an innovation as to\r\ntake a female student with him, even when visiting the poorest patients.\r\n\r\nMy good brother-in-law, who did not have my father’s prejudices and his\r\ndistrust in my eventual success as a practitioner, offered me financial\r\naid, promising to give guaranties to the people from whom I would hire\r\nrooms where I might begin practice.\r\n\r\nImmediately after my arrival in New York, I began to look out for a\r\nsuitable office, consulting Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell, with whom I had\r\nmaintained a constant correspondence, in regard to location.\r\n\r\nMy fears concerning the opposition to women physicians were fully\r\nrealized. I found no well-regulated household would rent rooms to\r\nme. I investigated everywhere, in all respectable parts of New York\r\nwherever signs announced “Parlor to let for a physician” or where I\r\nwas sent by agents. But as soon as it was learned that it was a woman\r\nphysician who desired the office, I was denied the opportunity of even\r\nlooking at the advertised rooms. Thus days and weeks were spent. I even\r\nbegan to explain and to remonstrate with those who sought tenants, but\r\nit was all in vain.\r\n\r\nSome were afraid to let an office to a female physician lest she might\r\nturn out a spiritual medium, clairvoyant, hydropathist, etc. Others,\r\nwho believed me when I told them that I had a diploma from a regular\r\nschool and should never practice contrary to its requirements, inquired\r\nto what religious denomination I belonged, and whether I had a private\r\nfortune or intended to support myself by my practice. While the third\r\nclass, who asked no questions at all, demanded three dollars a day for\r\na back parlor alone, without the privilege of putting a sign on the\r\nhouse or the door.\r\n\r\nNow all this may be very exasperating when it is absolutely necessary\r\nthat one should have a place upon which to put a sign to let the world\r\nknow that she is ready to try her skill upon suffering humanity; but\r\nit has such a strongly ludicrous side that I could not be provoked in\r\nspite of all the fatigue and disappointment of wandering over the city\r\nwhen, with aching limbs, I commenced the search afresh each morning,\r\nwith the same prospect of success.\r\n\r\nFinally, in a moderate-sized house, I was admitted by an introductory\r\nletter from an agent. The lady was kind and pleasant, entered into\r\nconversation with me and informed me that a cousin of hers had drawn\r\nher attention to the fact that women studied medicine in Cleveland. On\r\nfurther talk, she spoke of one who was especially liked by her cousin\r\nthrough the interest which Ralph Waldo Emerson took in her. And thus I\r\nfound that this lady was a cousin of Mrs. Emerson, of Hudson, Ohio.\r\n\r\nOf course, my heart was delighted to find a cultured woman not only\r\ninterested in me and my profession but who was also willing to have me\r\nbecome a member of her household, if--her husband agreed to such an\r\narrangement. Alas! in a few days came a letter in which she regretted\r\nthat her husband could not reconcile himself to a woman doctor. He\r\nfeared all sorts of annoyances should he take such a step as to have a\r\nwoman doctor go in and out of his house. At any rate, he could not bear\r\nthe thought of having the sign of a woman physician on his house.\r\n\r\nSuch was the horror that beset every one, that woman would disgrace\r\ndecency and undertake abhorred practice. The name of “Madame Restelle”\r\nwas on every one’s tongue as typifying the “female physician.” She was\r\nthen the leading abortionist, of whom a prominent lawyer said, when Dr.\r\nBlackwell and I called upon him to see if something could not be done\r\nto stop her in her vile career, “She is a social necessity, and she\r\nwill be protected by rich and influential personages.” However, I may\r\nhere remark that after many years of agitation, her infamous business\r\nsucceeded in placing her and some of her disciples in prison, and,\r\neventually, she killed herself by drowning in the spacious bathtub of\r\nthe extravagantly luxurious house on Fifth Avenue, where she resided\r\nunder her real name.\r\n\r\nThus time passed, and I could find no abode. My lack of success was\r\nsimilar to that of Dr. Blackwell who had finally been obliged to rent\r\na house, and she now proposed that I should join her at her home, she\r\nletting me have the back parlor for office purposes. Thus I was able to\r\narrange for office work as well as for general practice. Arrangements\r\nwere concluded and, on April 17, I established myself with her, yet\r\nindependent of her, in business.\r\n\r\nStill, small as was Dr. Blackwell’s practice, this association was of\r\ngreat benefit to me. Her household consisted of her relatives and was\r\nheaded by an older sister and her mother, a fine, cultivated lady.\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell and her husband joined us just before their\r\noldest daughter was expected, and there also came Lucy Stone and\r\nher husband, Henry Blackwell. In fact we were a delightful family,\r\nsuffering more or less from social ostracism but happy in spirit, and\r\nfeeling far above the ordinary run of mankind in the belief of our\r\nsuperiority in thought and aim.\r\n\r\nI love to remember the friendship which developed between Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell and myself when, wearied and disappointed in waiting for\r\npatients who seldom appeared, we renewed our courage by getting\r\ntemporarily away from the field of struggle. On Sundays, we took long,\r\nlong walks in Staten Island, in Jersey Heights, yes, even as far as\r\nHackensack, watching the budding trees, the inspiring scenery and the\r\nglorious sunsets, and renewing our faith in our calling as physicians.\r\nAnd we discussed all kinds of plans as to how to become of use to our\r\nfellow men and to ourselves.\r\n\r\n[These must have been memorable walks, for Dr. Blackwell refers to\r\nthem again and again in later life in her letters from England to Dr.\r\nZakrzewska, recalling “the picture which is hung up in memory, the\r\ndark-haired young physician with whom I used to walk on Weehawken\r\nHeights.”]\r\n\r\nAlas! money was wanting. To resume even the little dispensary work of\r\ntwo years previous was impossible, for the reëstablishment of that\r\ncalled for a sum of five hundred dollars and this we could not raise.\r\nMeanwhile, we tried to get opportunities to improve our practical\r\nknowledge by endeavoring to get admission into dispensaries or\r\nhospitals. Everywhere we met objections, and everywhere we found denial.\r\n\r\nMany high-stationed professors and physicians to whom Dr. Blackwell\r\nhad applied were willing, but the general practitioners objected, just\r\nas remains the situation at present in most instances. The fear that\r\nwomen doctors would diminish their practice was the real cause of\r\ntheir objection; although the denials were usually expressed as the\r\nmoral conviction that women could not take any serious responsibility,\r\nor, if they did, that they would unsex themselves. However, a\r\nGerman physician, Dr. Aigner, and a Scotch physician, Dr. McCready,\r\noccasionally allowed me to accompany them to their respective hospital\r\nand dispensary.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I had regularly attended the Fair meetings which were held\r\nevery Thursday, wondering how persons could afford to meet to so\r\nlittle purpose. There was scarcely any life in these gatherings, and\r\nwhen I saw ladies come week after week to resume the knitting of a\r\nbaby’s stocking (which was always laid aside again in an hour or two,\r\nwithout any marked progress), I began to doubt whether the sale of\r\nthese articles would ever bring ten thousand cents instead of the ten\r\nthousand dollars which it was proposed at the first meeting to raise in\r\norder to buy a house. I used to say on Wednesday, “To-morrow we have\r\nour Fair meeting. I wonder whether there will be, as usual, two and a\r\nhalf persons present or three and three-quarters.”\r\n\r\nAfter weeks of this idle waiting, for the few patients who came\r\nthrough acquaintances did not fill much of my time, I began to feel\r\ndesperate, especially as social life also was so utterly closed against\r\nus, and this latter was such a necessity to my temperament. I then\r\nproposed to go canvassing with circulars giving information of our\r\nprevious experiment, to try to collect money for the establishment of a\r\ndispensary.\r\n\r\nThe idea occurred to me to go from house to house and ask for a dime\r\nat each, which, if given, would amount to ten dollars a day; and, with\r\nthe money thus collected daily for half a year, to establish a nucleus\r\nhospital which, as a fixed fact, should stimulate its friends to\r\nfurther assistance.\r\n\r\nI took my notebook and wrote out the whole plan, and also calculated\r\nthe expenses of such a miniature hospital as I proposed, including\r\nfurniture, beds, household utensils, everything, in short, that was\r\nnecessary in such an institution. With this book which I still have\r\nin my possession, I went one evening into Dr. Blackwell’s parlor and,\r\nseating myself, told her that I could not work any longer for the Fair\r\nin the way that the ladies were doing; and then read my plan to her,\r\nwhich I advocated long and earnestly.\r\n\r\nShe finally agreed with me that it would be better speedily to\r\nestablish a small hospital than to wait for the large sum that had\r\nbeen proposed, though she did not approve of the scheme of the dime\r\ncollection, fearing that I would not only meet with great annoyances\r\nbut would also injure my health in the effort. At that time, after some\r\ndiscussion, I agreed with her. Now I think that this plan would have\r\nbeen better than that which I afterwards followed. On the same evening\r\nI proposed, and we agreed, that on a year from that day (the 1st of\r\nMay, 1857), the New York Infirmary should be opened.\r\n\r\nI went to rest with a light heart, but rose sorrowfully in the morning.\r\n“In one year from to-day, the Infirmary must be opened,” said I to\r\nmyself, “and the funds towards it are two pairs of half-knit babies’\r\nstockings.” The days passed in thinking what was the next best scheme\r\nto raise money for its foundation, when an accidental visit from Mary\r\nL. Booth to Dr. Blackwell turned the tide in another direction. Miss\r\nBooth was serving her apprenticeship as a journalist through the\r\nkindness of the editor of the New York _Times_.[7] Her sister who\r\nwas a patient of Dr. Blackwell had interested both Mary and him in the\r\nidea of women doctors, so Mary came to interview us concerning our\r\npractical progress.\r\n\r\nThis interview led to the disclosure of our wishes and plans regarding\r\nthe dispensary, and Miss Booth, taking up the idea, made our wishes\r\nknown in the _Times_, very guardedly, of course, but decidedly.\r\nThe effect of this little notice was remarkable, and it gave both Dr.\r\nBlackwell and myself new hope and also the courage to ask for similar\r\nremarks in other papers.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, my social circle became a little widened through this\r\nacquaintance with Miss Booth which I developed when I found that she\r\nalso was a beginner in her career and had obstacles to overcome; as,\r\nfor instance, hiding her sex by signing only her initials to whatever\r\nshe wrote, or not signing at all.\r\n\r\nThus a few new friends were obtained for our cause, and a few of Dr.\r\nBlackwell’s patients who belonged to the sect of Quakers, and who\r\nhad sustained the former dispensary, came forward promising small\r\nsubscriptions towards a new effort. Yet no sum was large enough to\r\nwarrant the expenditure of five hundred dollars, the amount absolutely\r\nneeded to open this charity for the poor and the chance for us to gain\r\npractical experience.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, of Boston, sent a patient of\r\nhers to Dr. Blackwell. This patient was accompanied by Dr. W. H.\r\nChanning, who was not in practice but who attended this patient with\r\nDr. Blackwell. Becoming acquainted with Dr. Channing, I disclosed to\r\nhim our financial, professional and social position, enlarging upon the\r\ndifficulty of obtaining that practical experience in clinics which is\r\nso absolutely necessary to the young physician.\r\n\r\nThen as I told him of the plan of establishing a dispensary which\r\ncould have a small number of indoor patients, in fact, the nucleus of\r\na hospital for which Dr. Blackwell had already obtained a charter from\r\nthe Legislature, his enthusiasm created not only hope but courage.\r\n\r\nHe spoke so ardently of Boston as being liberal and “the hothouse\r\nof all reforms” that I proposed visiting that noble city in the\r\ninterest of our plans and asked him for introductions, as I knew\r\nonly Dr. Harriot K. Hunt and Mrs. Severance, the latter recently\r\nremoved to Boston from Cleveland. He gave me a list of names of Boston\r\nladies--Miss Lucy Goddard, Miss Mary Jane Parkman, Miss Abby May and\r\nMrs. E. D. Cheney.\r\n\r\nWhen I look over my diary and see that the time of my receiving my\r\ndegree and leaving Cleveland was in March and that this proposition to\r\ngo to Boston was only three months later, it seems a fact impossible\r\nto believe. For the restlessness caused by the want of opportunity\r\nto further our desires seemed to turn days into weeks and weeks into\r\nmonths. I find in one of my notes the words, “It seems an impossibility\r\nto find friends for our cause; nobody seems to feel the need of\r\nhospital or dispensary for the practical training of women physicians.\r\nEven our gentlemen friends in the profession say women must find this\r\ntraining for themselves among the poor.”\r\n\r\nI may here remark, perhaps, a fact which amused me greatly. So far,\r\nI had had but very little opportunity to write prescriptions, but\r\nwhenever I gave any I added my initials, M. E. Z., as signature, thus\r\nproving my responsibility. Every time such a prescription was received\r\nby an American apothecary, a messenger called to inquire the meaning\r\nof those mystical signs. And when I explained that it was my name\r\nwhich was too long to write in full, I was told that signatures to\r\nprescriptions were not customary or needed. However, I continued to\r\nsign mine, for I felt from the very outset that I must establish the\r\nposition of being responsible for all I did, so that in case of trouble\r\nfrom either patient or apothecary I could protect myself. So I never\r\nfollowed the then prevailing custom of giving prescriptions without\r\nindicating for whom they were intended and by whom they were issued.\r\nPerhaps I may add that my practice by the end of the year had brought\r\nme one hundred and twenty dollars.\r\n\r\nThe earnestness with which Dr. Blackwell advocated not only the\r\nnecessity of having women as physicians but also their thorough\r\neducation and training for practice was convincing to a few friends,\r\nwho promised to assist with subscriptions as soon as the idea had taken\r\nshape and had materialized itself in a building in which the experiment\r\ncould be tried.\r\n\r\nNobody has fathomed the depth of Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell’s soul as I\r\nhave had the opportunity to do. On our delightful long walks she was\r\nthe speaker, and her reasoning was so sound, her determination so firm,\r\nher love for humanity so true, that she seemed to me a prophet of no\r\nordinary insight and foresight. Even now, when doubts arise in me\r\nwhether women will develop fully all the chances provided for their\r\nhigher scientific education, I recall her words and quiet my doubts,\r\nremembering that what one woman has done, thousands can do and will\r\ndo. To me she was, and is, not preëminently the physician but the\r\nphilanthropic philosopher, the standard bearer of a higher womanhood.\r\n\r\nTo such a nature, it is given to inspire others with an idea or an\r\nideal but not the faculty of execution or organization. I was able to\r\nsupply these latter qualities, and, encouraged by the description of\r\nBoston’s liberal element, I proposed to Dr. Blackwell to search for a\r\nhouse which would suit our purposes and to get an estimate of the rent\r\nand the expense of furnishing it, so as to have a definite sum for\r\nwhich to beg, since simple statements were not sufficient.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Blackwell refers to such complementary relations in a letter to\r\nDr. Zakrzewska, written in later years, in which she alludes to the\r\ndays here described and says:\r\n\r\n “I work chiefly in Principles, and you in putting them into practical\r\n use; and one is essential to the other in this complex life of ours.”\r\n\r\nAgain she refers to these days, “as we sat in Fifteenth Street planning\r\nthose everlasting bazaars,” and she writes:\r\n\r\n “You are a natural doctor, and your best work will always be in the\r\n full exercise of direct medical work.... You know I am different from\r\n you in not being a natural doctor; so, naturally, I do not confine\r\n myself to practice.\r\n\r\n “I am never without some patients but my thought, and active interest,\r\n is chiefly given to some of those moral ends--for which ends I took up\r\n the study of medicine.”]\r\n\r\nThe house was found in Bleecker Street close by the poor quarters,\r\nat an annual rental of one thousand, three hundred dollars, and an\r\nestimate was made of another five hundred dollars for furnishing, as\r\nwell as an outlay of one hundred dollars for fuel. My proposition was\r\nnow to go to Boston and try to get half of the rent pledged for a three\r\nyears’ lease, Dr. Blackwell to raise the other half of the three years’\r\nrent from friends in New York, and then to hold a Sale or Fair to raise\r\nthe remaining six hundred dollars.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the regular Fair meeting was held at Dr. Blackwell’s.\r\nThe new plan was brought forward, and, although it was as yet nothing\r\nbut a plan, it acted like a warm, soft rain upon a field after a long\r\ndrought. The knitting and sewing (for which I have a private horror\r\nunder all conditions) were laid aside, to my great relief. And the\r\nproject was talked of with so much enthusiasm that I already saw myself\r\nin imagination making my evening visits to the patients in the New York\r\nInfirmary; while all the members present (and there were unusually\r\nmany--I think, six or seven) discussed the question the next day among\r\ntheir circles of friends whether Henry Ward Beecher or a physician of\r\nhigh standing should make the opening speech in the institution.\r\n\r\nThis excitement increased the interest exceedingly, and the succeeding\r\nmeetings were quite enthusiastic. The babies’ stockings were never\r\nagain resumed (don’t think that because I detested those stockings so\r\nmuch I am cruel enough to wish the little creatures to go barefoot),\r\nbut plans were made for raising money in New York and for getting\r\narticles for sale on a larger scale.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that I went to Boston for the second time in the\r\nbeginning of July, visiting Mrs. C. M. Severance and using my\r\nintroductions to begin a regular, systematized campaign “to beg for an\r\ninstitution for American women.” For myself I could never have begged;\r\nI would sooner have drowned myself. Now I determined to beg money\r\nfrom Americans to establish an institution for their own benefit. Dr.\r\nBlackwell agreed to this plan, as there was nothing risked in it, I\r\ntaking the whole responsibility.\r\n\r\nIn spite of finding the women of Boston quite ready to listen to me,\r\nit was not an easy task to get a three years’ promise of six hundred\r\nand fifty dollars. The first question put to me was always, “Can you\r\nnot raise this small sum in rich New York?” The explanation had to\r\nbe repeated over and over that only a very few women in social life\r\ndared to connect themselves openly with “such radical reformers” as\r\nwe appeared to them. To turn upon “the sphere of woman” and declare\r\nopenly that she can take the whole responsibility of managing a public\r\ninstitution, as well as the care as a physician of sick women and\r\nchildren, seemed so monstrous to most men and women that in New York\r\nmoney was intrusted to us only with incredulity.\r\n\r\nThe second and more important question was as to “why we needed and\r\nwanted a dispensary and a hospital for women physicians.” Nobody at\r\nthis present time would or could believe that this need then had to\r\nmost people a preposterous sound.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may tell you an episode which occurred to me in\r\nPhiladelphia, to which city I went after returning from Boston with\r\nmy six hundred and fifty dollars pledged. In Philadelphia, the first\r\nmedical college for women (the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania),\r\nhad been established in 1850, and it was housed in extremely modest\r\nquarters in a rear building on Arch Street. I was introduced through\r\nDr. Ann Preston, one of the first graduates of this college and now\r\none of its professors. And I spoke to the friends of this enterprise\r\nat a gathering of both men and women, explaining the need of a\r\npractical professional training after a merely theoretical course of\r\ninstruction. I tried to make plain the greater difficulties which beset\r\nthe introduction of the young women students to the private patients\r\nof their preceptors even though these patients were ever so poor, and\r\nI illustrated the situation by quoting Dr. Ann Preston’s conscientious\r\nrefusal to practice under such circumstances, she simply teaching\r\nphysiology in the college. I also spoke of others going to Europe to\r\nseek this clinical instruction from foreign physicians and maternity\r\nhospitals.\r\n\r\nAfter having exhausted the subject, as well as myself, one of the\r\nladies present said--it was in the parlors of Lucretia Mott--“Then\r\nthee thinks that a hospital must be connected with the college?” I\r\nreplied, “Yes.” “Then thee thinks that practical training cannot be got\r\nby the young physician among the poor?” I said, “No.” “We thank thee\r\nfor thy coming to tell us so, and we promise thee that we shall exert\r\nourselves at once to get a hospital of our own.”\r\n\r\nThus ended my efforts in that noble city. But the Philadelphia Woman’s\r\nHospital was established there within the five years following my visit.\r\n\r\nIn Portland, Maine, where I went by the advice of Mr. Samuel E. Sewall\r\nand his aunt, Miss ----, I also met with no success for the Infirmary.\r\nHere, in spite of my being the guest of some of their relatives, none\r\ndared to expose themselves to the ridicule of asking acquaintances\r\nto see or hear a woman doctor. To illustrate again something of the\r\nfeeling regarding a woman doctor, I must tell an incident which in\r\nafter years caused us great amusement.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriot K. Hunt had introduced me, in Boston, to Mr. Joseph Sewall,\r\nand we had been invited to meet Mr. Samuel E. Sewall, Miss Lucy E.\r\nSewall and Miss ----, their aunt. While sitting in the parlor waiting\r\nfor the dinner hour, Lucy Sewall went upstairs and, as she told me in\r\nlater years, examined my cloak, bonnet and gloves in order to find out\r\nwhether they were neat and respectable, she feeling a great uncertainty\r\nas to whether a regularly graduated and practicing woman physician\r\ncould attend to the minor details of proper habiliments. Dr. Hunt was\r\naccepted by them as a curiosity but she had never been a regular\r\nstudent in a college. However, all this company became our truest\r\nfriends, as the history of the New England Hospital for Women and\r\nChildren testifies.\r\n\r\nThe season being July, it was not favorable for doing any more than\r\nsecuring signatures, guaranteeing for the New York Infirmary for\r\nIndigent Women and Children six hundred and fifty dollars, for half\r\nthe rent annually for three years. But friendly invitations to revisit\r\nBoston caused me to return in early October.\r\n\r\nThe encouragement which I brought back to New York from the Boston\r\nfriends rendered it easy for Dr. Blackwell to secure among her friends\r\nthe other half of the rent. However, we also needed money to furnish\r\nand to prepare the house as a hospital and dispensary. But we hoped to\r\nobtain this additional money from the Fair which had been so long in\r\npreparation, and it was in connection with this that I again appeared\r\nin Boston.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I made the most valuable acquaintance of Mrs. E. D.\r\nCheney who has ever since been a true and devoted friend of the medical\r\neducation of women.\r\n\r\nThis visit was rich in experience as I was introduced by my\r\nacquaintances made in July to a great number of the leading women in\r\nthe anti-slavery cause. From these I learned how the anti-slavery\r\nbazaars were managed, and I obtained a promise to provide a table at\r\nour New York fair in December, as well as the names of several ladies\r\nwho would superintend it, so that accommodations for their sojourn in\r\nNew York might be made. Another table was promised by Dr. Blackwell’s\r\nEnglish friends to whom she had appealed by letters.\r\n\r\nI also visited a number of the smaller towns around Boston for the\r\nsame purpose but without success. A list of the Boston people in whose\r\nhouses I spoke, creating enthusiasm, and who subscribed towards the\r\nhalf of the Infirmary rent as well as towards the table for the Fair,\r\nis still in my possession and I will here copy the names:\r\n\r\n  Miss Lucy Goddard\r\n  Miss Abby May\r\n  Miss Mary Jane Parkman\r\n  Mrs. George Hildreth\r\n  Mrs. George Hilliard\r\n  Miss Anna Lowell\r\n  Mrs. Mary G. Shaw\r\n  Mrs. Sarah S. Russell\r\n  Mrs. W. L. Garrison\r\n  Mrs. E. D. Cheney\r\n  Miss Sarah Clarke\r\n  Mrs. James Freeman Clarke\r\n  Mr. George W. Bond\r\n  Mr. Samuel E. Sewall\r\n\r\nbesides a goodly number of others not so prominent in benevolent and\r\nadvanced work for women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n _Boston’s help for the Infirmary stimulates New York, sometimes to\r\n unconscious humor--Meeting with Fanny Kemble--Dr. Zakrzewska obtains\r\n entrée into the variety of social “circles” then existing--The Cary\r\n sisters--Women of the Press--The educational circle--The esthetic\r\n group--The so-called Free Lovers--The artistic circle--Mrs. Z.’s\r\n social circle--The philanthropic circle--The Fourierites--The\r\n demonstrating Spiritualists--Woman’s Rights meetings--Dr. Zakrzewska\r\n and Horace Greeley opposing speakers in discussion on “Divorce”--Dr.\r\n Emily urges Dr. Blackwell to give up New York for London, opposition\r\n there being lessened by Florence Nightingale’s work--The Fair finally\r\n materializes and is successful--Dr. Emily Blackwell returns from\r\n Europe, making the third physician working upon the Infirmary plans.\r\n (Twenty-seven years of age: 1856.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the letters from Dr. Emily Blackwell, who was completing her\r\nmedical studies in England, urged Dr. Blackwell to give up her life in\r\nAmerica and come to England as a more promising field for developing\r\nthe introduction of medical women into practice.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Blackwell held fast to the fact that in America the first\r\nWoman’s Medical College (Philadelphia) had been in existence for\r\nseveral years, and she felt that it would be unwise to desert this\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe struggles of this little college were so great because all aids\r\nto foster its growth were so hard to acquire; and also because many a\r\nstudent withdrew from the school after a few months of attendance upon\r\nlearning what great obstacles were to be overcome in acquiring medical\r\nknowledge and how great was the social prejudice against female medical\r\nstudents. Hence, only the brave, the courageous, the determined, and\r\nthe financially equipped women could remain and weather the stormy days\r\nof their student life.\r\n\r\nThus it was felt best that the realization of the New York Infirmary\r\nshould be carried on; and Dr. Emily promised to interest her English\r\nfriends to contribute to the English table. Dr. Blackwell’s friends and\r\nwell-wishers began with great zeal to arrange sewing circles, while new\r\nfriends were acquired who were willing to assist in the charity even if\r\nnot inclined to the “reformers,” as we were called.\r\n\r\nAn old lady, Mrs. T----, residing on Fifth Avenue, was one of the newly\r\nacquired friends. She also wished to assist us by introducing us into\r\nher circle and she invited me to her reception days which were held\r\nfrom eleven to one--the fashionable hours at that time.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty was not in my name, for it was very fashionable at\r\nthat time to introduce exiles and their friends into society, but\r\nwhat should be my title? She said that I was too young to be called\r\n“Madame”; and “Miss” would not sound well with my unpronounceable name\r\nwhile “Doctor”--oh! no! she could not call me that; and “Doctress” was\r\nnot reputable. So, what?\r\n\r\nThen, what would I talk about? “Hospitals,” of course. Yes, of\r\ncourse--and then she added, tolerantly, “Well, if you must talk on\r\nhospitals, do not mention women doctors but say for the purpose of\r\n‘training nurses,’ which is now so fashionable in England through Miss\r\nNightingale’s training at Kaiserswerth, Germany.”\r\n\r\nAnother lady invited me to dine with her. And she remarked, “I shall be\r\nall alone and we can talk your plans over without being disturbed or\r\nridiculed by my husband and sons. You see,” she added, “my daughters\r\nare married and we hold by our fortune a position which would equal\r\nthat of a duchess in your country, so we must be very careful not to\r\noffend good taste by inviting reformers without a thorough knowledge\r\nof their plans.” When I replied that my ancestry was about as good as\r\nher money as we dated our name back to 911, she was quite relieved and\r\nasked permission to tell this fact to her friends in order to explain\r\nher interest in me.\r\n\r\nThen there was the little incident which I never can forget, so\r\nludicrous did it appear to me, when Dr. Blackwell and I called upon\r\nFanny Kemble, and she most tragically exclaimed, “_Women_\r\nDOCTORS! NEVER!”\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months, Dr. Blackwell gained a number of new\r\nacquaintances who, being inclined towards the elevation of woman’s\r\neducation, were sent to us by Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, of Boston. Among\r\nthese were Miss Elizabeth Peabody and Miss Anne Whitney (the latter\r\nthen known simply as a poet, now also as a sculptor) who interested\r\nthemselves deeply in our projects. And through them we became\r\nacquainted with Mrs. Angelina Grimké Weld and her sister, Miss Sarah\r\nGrimké, and Mrs. Spring, all these being our neighbors across the\r\nHudson, residing at Eagleswood. Other valuable aid came through Mrs.\r\nLucy Stone and Mrs. Antoinette Brown Blackwell who, sharing the home\r\nwith us, formed strong links with all the liberally inclined members of\r\nthe anti-slavery movement. My friend, Mary L. Booth, became of great\r\nassistance to me, and I joined an association of women, called the\r\n_Alpha_, of which she was secretary.\r\n\r\nThere was a quiet revolution going on in all strata of social life. The\r\npresent generation can form only an approximate idea of the spirit of\r\nthe time in those years. New England transcendentalism had influenced\r\nall intelligent people throughout the country. It was a real _Sturm\r\nund Drang_ period which pervaded men and women alike. Abolitionism\r\nwas at its height. Everywhere, the _pros_ and _cons_ of the means to\r\nabolish slavery was the topic of conversations and discussions. And\r\ntranscendentalism was interpreted into all kinds of _isms_ because\r\nnobody could define its meaning. Thus it happened that there arose\r\na great many circles and cliques in which one or more theories were\r\nnurtured.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasantest of these circles was that formed by the sisters,\r\nAlice and Phœbe Cary, who kept open house every Sunday evening from\r\neight to eleven o’clock. These were not the fashionable, senseless\r\nreceptions of the present day, but real social gatherings where\r\neverybody came regularly and often took up the conversation where\r\nit was left unfinished the week before, or brought the new events\r\nof the week for discussion. All was informal; no sitting down, the\r\nlittle parlor often holding fifty or sixty guests, many representing\r\nthe press or politics; no refreshments except a pitcher of cold water\r\nand glasses in the hall. Eminent men were always the center at these\r\ngatherings--the names of Greeley, Colfax, Ripley, Garrison, and a host\r\nof similar leaders were never wanting.\r\n\r\nThis description answers very well for all the other circles. The\r\ncharm of all these gatherings consisted in the fact that they were not\r\nreceptions but places where everybody came regularly when disengaged\r\notherwise, or while in New York if not resident. No refreshments were\r\nserved but a liberal supply of ice water, with plenty of glasses, stood\r\nin a little room or in the hall, while conversation or discussion or\r\nmusic or even dancing formed the attraction.\r\n\r\nOne circle was the promoter of women in the press, and this was\r\nheaded by Mrs. Elizabeth Oakes Smith. She held open house on Thursday\r\nevenings, and here all the then-known press women, musicians and\r\nartists met in the most liberal spirit.\r\n\r\nIn the educational field were Mrs. Kirtland and Miss Haynes, who each\r\nhad the best school for young ladies but to whose houses invitations\r\nwere needed.\r\n\r\nThe esthetic group, representing those who aspired to the cultivation\r\nof the fine arts, and including exiles of renown, gathered at evening\r\nreceptions under the leadership of Mrs. X. In her elegant parlors every\r\none who was introduced by those already accepted was welcomed and\r\nentertained with music, conversation and card playing. Mr. and Mrs.\r\nGeorge Hildreth could be found there week after week, as well as the\r\nthen most-renowned musicians and actors.\r\n\r\nAnother very prominent circle was that of the Free Lovers, then so\r\ncalled. Mrs. Grosvenor was called by Mr. Alcott, whom I first met at\r\nher evenings, the “high priestess of free love.” This circle was most\r\nfrequented by all persons who represented any _ism_. Mr. Alcott\r\nheld his conversations often in this house. Messrs. Ripley, Greeley,\r\nAlbert Brisbane; the pianist, Gottschalk; the advocate of Spiritualism,\r\nAndrew Jackson Davis; the communist, Stephen Pearl Andrews;\r\nrepresentatives of legislatures and of Congress; as well as literary\r\nwomen and artists--all could here find people who were intellectually\r\ncongenial to them in this field of speculation.\r\n\r\nA purely artistic circle gathered at Miss Freeman’s studio apartments.\r\nShe being then the most prominent illustrator of books, drew around\r\nher delightful aspirants in art and music. In her parlor, I met Miss\r\nCharlotte Cushman, who kindly patronized me and my internes and\r\nstudents after the New York Infirmary was established, by sending us\r\ntickets to her performances.\r\n\r\nAn important social circle gathered around Mrs. Z., the leader of taste\r\nand fashion, who entertained in her elegant and spacious parlors. Here\r\nalso whist playing was cultivated under the leadership of Mr. George\r\nHildreth, who patiently taught me whenever I could join his table.\r\n\r\nThe philanthropic circle was the smallest. Its leaders were Mr.\r\nCharles Brace of “Five Points” fame, Mr. Peter Cooper, Miss Elizabeth\r\nP. Peabody, and the Sedgwick family, of which Miss Catherine Sedgwick\r\nwas the most prominent member. I attended meetings of this circle\r\nthrough Dr. Elizabeth Blackwell.\r\n\r\nAnother important and active influence was exerted by the admirers of\r\nthe socialist Fourier. A movement was initiated similar to the Brook\r\nFarm movement, in Boston. Mr. Marcus Spring had erected a phalanstery,\r\nin Eagleswood, New Jersey, where ideal housekeeping, education, the\r\ncultivation of literature and high-grade amusement were the objects\r\npursued. To this phase of social life, I was introduced through Mrs.\r\nTheodore Weld, Miss Sarah Grimké, Miss Elizabeth P. Peabody and Mrs.\r\nHorace Mann. Menial labor was abhorred, in contradistinction to Brook\r\nFarm ideas; the culture of mind and of body was preëminent, and Mr.\r\nTheodore Weld was the High Priest.\r\n\r\nA strange center was that of the demonstrating Spiritualists, who\r\nwere held together by Mrs. Cleveland and her sister, Mrs. Horace\r\nGreeley. Here, as it happened, abolitionists appeared most prominently,\r\nand general invitations to the house were extended only during the\r\n“Convention Week” in May. The Fox Sisters have been said to perform\r\nwonderful feats on such occasions. I never witnessed any, as each time\r\nthat I happened to be present disturbing elements were said to prevent\r\nthe materialization of the spirits. Soon after this, the Fox Sisters\r\njoined the Roman Catholic Church and were said to have confessed that\r\nall their performances were well-arranged deceptions.\r\n\r\nThus I became acquainted with the leading minds who agitated the\r\npublic, and who helped to advance our plans for the establishment of a\r\nhospital where women physicians could prove their capacity and skill by\r\nattending sick women and children.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Dr. Blackwell was not in general harmony with these\r\ndifferent phases of social development; on the contrary, she often\r\nfelt repelled by the theories advanced by them. And I was not only\r\ninterested and instructed in the various ways of freedom of thought\r\nand speech, but also greatly amused by the frequent extravaganzas and\r\noddities of persons and occurrences, especially at the Anti-Slavery\r\nmeetings and, later, at the so-called Woman’s Rights conventions.\r\n\r\nFor instance, on one occasion Mrs. Ernestine L. Rose was speaking, when\r\na mob of men was determined to quiet her by making unseemly noises.\r\nA handsome, delicate little woman, she stood silent on the platform\r\nlistening to the roaring of these men. All at once they became quiet,\r\nimpressed by her statuelike dignity, and one of the disturbers called\r\nout, “Go on, old steamboat!” to which she calmly replied, “As soon\r\nas you have done.” She then spoke for a whole hour without further\r\ninterruption.\r\n\r\nSimilar interruptions can be related by Lucy Stone and Antoinette\r\nBrown Blackwell. Both of these ladies at that time formed part of Dr.\r\nElizabeth Blackwell’s family, in New York, which was presided over\r\nby the most genial, kind and efficient old lady, Mrs. Blackwell, the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nA great misfortune for us was that the components of these circles,\r\nwhile not exactly poor, were certainly not rich. All the assistance\r\nwhich they could give us was in good will and good wishes. Yet these\r\nwere of great help after all, for they opened channels which led us to\r\nthe well-to-do. These latter were influenced by motives of philanthropy\r\nand also by the general awakening of the spirit which began to demand\r\nnobler fields of action than the providing of mere physical comforts.\r\nThey also opened the way for us to friends such as Mr. George W.\r\nCurtis, Rev. O. B. Frothingham (then in Newark), Rev. Henry Ward\r\nBeecher, Drs. McCready, Kissam and Porter, Rev. Mr. Bellows, Rev. Mr.\r\nChapin, Dr. Tuthill (one of the editors of the New York _Times_)\r\nand his wife and sister; Mrs. R. G. Shaw (mother of Col. Robert Shaw),\r\nMrs. Marcus Spring, the Misses Sedgwick, Mrs. Howland and many others,\r\nwho came to our assistance and turned the social scale somewhat in our\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\nI might here record an experience which I had as a member of what we\r\nwould now call a “Woman’s Club,” and which was named the “Alpha.” This\r\nassociation was composed of women who were striving for the advancement\r\nof women. Its leader and president was Mrs. Lyons, Miss Mary L. Booth\r\nwas secretary, and Miss Sarah Tuthill was treasurer. Its meetings were\r\nheld alternately at the houses of Mrs. Lyons and Miss Booth. It also\r\nheld social gatherings several times during the year, and to these\r\ngentlemen were invited and asked to take part in the discussions.\r\nAmong these latter were Horace Greeley and George Ripley, but there\r\nwere also all persons well known in literary or professional life.\r\n\r\nAt one of these latter meetings the divorce question was made the\r\nsubject for discussion, and Mr. Horace Greeley was appointed to take\r\nthe negative side and I the affirmative. As I was with and in the\r\nspirit of the times in discussing the subject, it was decided by the\r\njudges that I had the better of the argument.\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley was so excited and provoked that he said, “Then, Madam,\r\nI understand that a man has the right to say to his wife on Sunday\r\nmorning when he finds that a button is missing on his shirt, ‘Wife, I\r\ndemand that we get divorced!’”\r\n\r\nAll were rather confounded by his argument and looked dubiously at me.\r\nFortunately, my wits were previously rather excited, and so I replied:\r\n\r\n“Mr. Greeley, the sooner such a man seeks a divorce from his wife, the\r\nbetter for her, because if he considers such a trifle as he mentions a\r\ncause for divorce, he is not married in the sense he ought to be.”\r\n\r\nThis incident he related soon afterward in the _Tribune_, with\r\nthe addition of pointing out the danger to which the “thinking” of\r\nwomen will lead. And he markedly ignored me whenever by chance we met\r\nafterward.\r\n\r\nAll these experiences were of great interest and advantage to me\r\npersonally, and I developed all these opportunities for forwarding my\r\nplans and gaining friends, little by little, for the idea of employing\r\nwomen physicians. But the main object at that time was to gain friends\r\nfor the proposed Fair in December.\r\n\r\nAs I now look back on that time when a little pin-cushion or mat was\r\npresented for this enterprise and think how joyful we were, as we saw\r\nin every little gift the desired dollar, or even fifty cents, and then\r\ncompare that state of affairs with the present, when we calmly announce\r\nthat ten thousand dollars must be raised by a Fair, I cannot hope to\r\ndescribe the happy emotion which I then felt over the gift of fifty\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nIt is not the size of the gift or the amount of money which it\r\nrepresents which swells our breast with thankfulness and happiness.\r\nIt is, after all, the sympathy which the gift conveys which makes its\r\nvalue, and this value is greatest when such sympathy is most needed.\r\n\r\nOh! the golden time of Youth and Hope! How little we improve the\r\nchances in our later years to assist the young in their aspirations!\r\nAnd thus do we deprive both them and ourselves of that which means true\r\nhappiness, namely, sympathetic relations between on the one hand, those\r\nwho keep the world and its interests moving by their aspirations; and,\r\non the other hand, those who have retired, often with disappointment,\r\nbecause of the little they could effect individually.\r\n\r\nIt is youth and the superior wisdom of the young, no matter whether\r\nthey have it in reality or only in their imagination, which leads\r\nhumanity onward toward the millennium. Humanity is, and must remain,\r\nyoung; and no olden times are worthy of being held up as an example.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, letters from Dr. Emily Blackwell, who was continuing her\r\nstudies in England, came cheeringly with promises of help towards the\r\nFair. But she also continued to urge the abandonment of the work in the\r\nUnited States and its transference to London, where a desire to promote\r\nthe education of medical women had begun to manifest itself after\r\nMiss Florence Nightingale had so successfully shown the necessity of\r\neducating nurses in their profession.\r\n\r\nOne of the great advantages in such transference to England urged upon\r\nDr. Blackwell was that we would not there have to live down or fight\r\nthe nefarious and criminal practice which was being carried on chiefly\r\nin New York City, but also more or less in smaller places, and which by\r\nits advertising in the newspapers had created such a strong prejudice\r\nagainst “Doctresses,” as its practitioners were styled.\r\n\r\nWe were obliged to place the intention of training nurses in the\r\nforeground when appealing for sympathy or assistance in our work, in\r\norder to get any kind of hearing among the philanthropists, or in\r\nsending articles to the newspapers.\r\n\r\nFinally, in November, we saw the result of our efforts becoming\r\nsubstantiated in boxes, in baskets, in trunks and in the closets, so\r\nthat we now were ready to decide upon a locality where we might offer\r\nour treasures to the benevolent of New York City.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackwell called a meeting in her parlors of all the ladies who\r\nhad interested themselves during the summer, and we discussed halls,\r\nas well as vestries, which might prove attractive to the public, and\r\na committee was appointed to visit the different places and to seek\r\ninterviews with those in control of them.\r\n\r\nI was, of course, one of the members of the committee, and we decided\r\nto go to the places in groups of two or three and to report the result\r\nat the end of a week. In less than three days, however, the chairman\r\ncalled a meeting of the committee because of the experiences of the\r\nthree groups who had spent two days from morning till evening visiting\r\nthe agents of the different desirable, and even undesirable, locations.\r\nEverywhere they had received the same answer, namely, “We don’t want to\r\nhave anything to do with women doctors or irresponsible ladies wishing\r\nto hold a Fair in our place.”\r\n\r\nNot the proposition to pay in advance nor the promise that we should\r\nnot advertise the fact that it was intended to furnish a hospital for\r\nfemale physicians, as they were then called, could soften the hearts of\r\nthese men, who simply closed all discussion by saying, “It is not our\r\ncustom to deal with ladies.” Even the kind words of Dr. Bellows could\r\nnot induce the men of his church to allow us the use of their vestry.\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\nA general meeting was again called, and the husband of one of the\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Haydock, suggested that we hire a large loft in a\r\nbuilding, in the business quarters, of which he had control. This was\r\nan unfinished room with a bare floor of unplaned boards with numerous\r\nknot holes and protruding nails. It had no fixtures for lighting and\r\nno ornaments overhead but rough beams and rafters. Another lady of the\r\ncommittee proposed to send her parlor chandeliers to be connected with\r\nthe gas pipes; while a friend of Dr. Blackwell made a drawing showing\r\nhow to cover bare, rough walls with evergreens and wreaths. Others\r\nloaned rugs for the floor and draperies for the walls, and we used\r\nevergreens to conceal the bareness above.\r\n\r\nThe necessity to have a place at all caused us to accept these\r\npropositions and, in spite of three long rough flights of stairs,\r\nwe advertised our Fair largely and also the motive for holding it,\r\npraising its arrangements and enlarging upon its novelty as well as\r\nupon its choice goods. We charged ten cents admission and we drew\r\na good attendance for four days, realizing six hundred dollars net\r\nprofit. And what an immense sum this seemed to us all!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n _Opening of the New York Infirmary, both dispensary and\r\n hospital--Details of its arrangement and furnishing--Dr. Zakrzewska\r\n is resident physician and instructor to the students, and also\r\n superintendent and housekeeper, while carrying on her private\r\n practice and consulting in the Out-Practice--Sample record of one\r\n day’s work--Four resident students from the Philadelphia medical\r\n college--Incidents in practice--Mobbing of the Infirmary following\r\n death of a patient. (Twenty-eight years of age: 1856-1857.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nWe at once entered into negotiation for the house we had in view and\r\nobtained the refusal of it for the 1st of March, 1857. We also ordered\r\nthe twenty-four iron bedsteads needed, for the sum of one hundred\r\ndollars, and all the ladies went to work begging and preparing house\r\nlinen, so that when the year closed we held a most joyful New Year’s\r\nDay, and received so many congratulations that we actually thought\r\nourselves in the command of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\nThe house was an old-fashioned mansion of the Dutch style, at the\r\ncorner of Bleecker and Crosby Streets, just at the outer end of what\r\nwas called the “Five Points,” fully respectable on the Bleecker Street\r\nside, and full of patients and misery on the other side and at the\r\nrear. And we spent the few weeks which elapsed before we could begin to\r\narrange it in getting the good will of editors, ministers and business\r\nmen, in order that we might procure the means for carrying on a charity\r\nfor which we had nothing but an empty purse.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackwell’s influence among the Quakers, many of them rich, and\r\nMiss Mary L. Booth’s indefatigable notices in the newspapers, opened to\r\nus the ways of procuring the necessary materials for the dispensary,\r\nwhich occupied the lower front room. It contained a consulting desk,\r\nan examination table behind a large screen, shelves for medicines and\r\na table for preparing the ingredients of prescriptions. The front\r\nentrance hall was comfortably arranged with settees for the patients\r\nto wait their turn. Donations from several wholesale druggists were\r\nreceived, and second-hand furniture suitable for our purposes was\r\ncheaply acquired.\r\n\r\nA door was put in to separate the back hall from the front hall, and\r\nin this back hall was placed a large stove which heated the stairways,\r\nthere being no furnace in the house. This back hall also served as a\r\ndining room for the officers, while the large kitchen opening into it\r\nwas ample for all culinary purposes and also allowed space for the\r\nservants’ dining table.\r\n\r\nThe second floor was arranged for two wards, each containing six beds;\r\nwhile the third floor was made into a maternity department, the little\r\nhall room serving as a sitting room for the physicians. Open grate coal\r\nfires provided the only heat throughout the house.\r\n\r\nThe fourth, or attic, floor contained four rooms--two large ones and\r\ntwo small ones, with a square hall in the center. The two large rooms\r\nserved as sleeping rooms, one for four students and the other for\r\nthree servants. One of the small rooms served a similar purpose for the\r\nresident physician and one student, while the other was the much needed\r\nstore and trunk room. As the attic was rather low studded, the doors\r\nwere all kept open, and the skylight of the center hall was kept lifted\r\nexcept during a storm.\r\n\r\nThese apartments were furnished with such material as benevolence\r\nprovided. It was the most curious mixture of elegant old furniture and\r\ncheap stands and chairs, without any comfort or system, each of us\r\ndoing the best we could with our belongings as the house was almost\r\nentirely devoid of closet room.\r\n\r\nInto this primitive, first true “Woman’s Hospital” in the world, I\r\nmoved in March, superintending all its arrangements, with the kind\r\nassistance of a few ladies appointed by the now organized board of\r\ndirectors. We ventured to hire one servant to clean, wash and do\r\ngeneral work, as I was the only inmate until the house was regularly\r\nand formally opened on May 1, 1857.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackwell was aided in procuring speakers by Dr. Emily who had\r\nreturned from Europe a few weeks before this memorable event. Henry\r\nWard Beecher, Dr. William Elder from Philadelphia and Dr. Kissam,\r\na prominent New York physician who was in favor of our experiment,\r\ncarried out the program and solemnized the undertaking, while the\r\naudience, seated among the snowy white little beds, felt proud of\r\nhaving accomplished so much.\r\n\r\nBut even here my proposition to have one of the Drs. Blackwell also\r\nspeak and explain our intentions was refused by our patrons, because it\r\nwas feared that she might speak “like a Woman’s Rights woman.” So we\r\nremained in the background, in the most elated spirits yet modest in\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nA sign on the front door told the purpose of the house, and very soon\r\nour old patrons of the Tompkins Square Dispensary found their way to\r\nthe now comparatively speaking, quite stylish place. And before a month\r\nhad passed, we had our beds filled with patients and a daily attendance\r\nof thirty and more dispensary patients. Drs. Elizabeth and Emily\r\nBlackwell and myself each attended the dispensary two mornings in the\r\nweek, from nine to twelve, while four students from the Philadelphia\r\ncollege came to live in the hospital in the capacity of internes,\r\napothecaries and pupils of nursing.\r\n\r\nThe students spent thus their summer months between their lecture\r\nterms in Philadelphia, grateful to have at last an opportunity to see\r\nactual practice. Of course, they had to pay for this opportunity, three\r\ndollars a week for board, as the establishment could not afford to feed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe also had two nurses, one for the general wards and one for the\r\nmaternity department. They were both unskilled and considered the\r\ntraining as more than sufficient equivalent for their services,\r\nreceiving simply an allowance of two dollars per week for their\r\nnecessary clothing. Thus we kept true to our promise to begin at once\r\na system for training nurses, although the time specified for that\r\npurpose was only six months. However, one woman remained with us for\r\nseveral years, and in the course of time she became invaluable as head\r\nnurse.\r\n\r\nAs for myself, I occupied a peculiar position. I was resident\r\nphysician, superintendent, housekeeper and instructor to the students\r\nof whom none was graduated, so that I had the full responsibility of\r\nall their activities, both inside and outside the little hospital. In\r\norder to give an idea of the situation, I want to relate from my notes\r\nthe record of one day of my work.\r\n\r\nAt 5:30 A. M., I started in an omnibus for the wholesale market,\r\npurchasing provisions for a week, and at 8:00, I was back to breakfast.\r\nThis consisted, for all inmates except patients, of tea, bread and\r\nbutter, Indian meal mush and syrup, every morning except Sundays when\r\ncoffee and breakfast bacon were added.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, I made my visit to the patients in the house with\r\ntwo of the students, while the other two students attended upon Dr.\r\nBlackwell in the dispensary. Then a confinement case arrived and I\r\nattended to her, giving orders to students and nurses. After this, I\r\ndescended into the kitchen department, as the provisions had arrived,\r\nand with the assistance of the cook I arranged all these so as to\r\npreserve the materials, and I settled the diet for all as far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nI then took another omnibus ride to the wholesale druggist, begging and\r\nbuying needed articles for the dispensary and the hospital, arriving\r\nhome at 1:00 P. M. for dinner. This consisted every day of a good soup,\r\nthe soup meat, potatoes, one kind of well-prepared vegetable, with\r\nfruit for dessert. On Sundays, we had a roast or a steak, while in the\r\nwinter we occasionally had poultry when this was sent in as a donation\r\nand when the amount was more than was needed for the patients.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I usually went out to see my private patients, because\r\nreceiving no compensation I depended upon my earnings for personal\r\nneeds. On this day, however, I was detained by the confinement case\r\nmentioned and could not go out till 5:00 P. M., returning at 7:00 P.\r\nM. for tea. This always consisted of bread and butter, tea and sauce\r\nor cheese or fresh gingerbread. After again making the rounds of the\r\npatients in the house, it was 9:00 o’clock.\r\n\r\nThen the students assembled with me in the little hall room, I cutting\r\nout towels or pillow cases or other needed articles for the house or\r\nthe patients, while the students folded or even basted the articles for\r\nthe sewing machine as they recited their various lessons for the day.\r\nAfter their recital, I gave them verbal instruction in midwifery. We\r\nfinished the work of the day by 11:30, as I never allowed any one to be\r\nout of bed after midnight unless detained by a patient.\r\n\r\nThis day is a fair illustration of our life. If I had not food to\r\nprovide, it was something else; if not drugs, it was drygoods; and\r\nif neither, I attended the dispensary at least two forenoons, and if\r\neither of the Drs. Blackwell was prevented by private business from\r\nattending her regular forenoon, I attended in her place.\r\n\r\nThe strain upon us all, added to the very meager diet, was immense,\r\nand it became a necessity to provide relaxations. So I arranged that\r\nduring the summer, once a month, we all went on a picnic during an\r\nafternoon in the hills across the Hudson; and in the winter, once a\r\nmonth, we went to a good theater which was near by, and where we often\r\nsaw Joseph Jefferson, Laura Keene, Karl Formes or Brignoli. These\r\nentertainments were highly refreshing, and, what was very important,\r\nthey were cheap; theater prices were then very moderate and simple\r\npicnics were furnished at low rates.\r\n\r\nOh! how delightful were those days, in their youthful enthusiasm and\r\nfilled with hopes. They were full of hard work, both day and night, for\r\nour out-door poor practice increased almost faster than the dispensary\r\nmorning clinics, but a few leisure hours once in a while were enjoyed\r\nas we had never before in our lives enjoyed the most desirable events\r\nor festivities.\r\n\r\nAlso, we were patronized by those families who, in favor of our medical\r\nwork as reformers, often invited us to their receptions where we\r\nenjoyed intellectual diversion. Among others already mentioned were\r\nthe Sunday evenings at the house of the sisters, Alice and Phœbe Cary,\r\nwhere distinguished men and women filled the homelike parlors and\r\npartook of plenty of ice water as refreshment.\r\n\r\nAnother house open to us was that of Mrs. Oakes Smith, where art and\r\nliterature were represented. Another was that of the leading lady of\r\nfashion, Mrs. Cole, where whist and music formed the entertaining\r\npleasures. Here I felt especially at home with Mr. George Hildreth as\r\nwhist partner, his being almost deaf giving me a fine opportunity to be\r\ndiverted without exertion when too tired even to talk.\r\n\r\nTo be seen and noticed in these circles was an advantage to medical\r\nwomen and to our little hospital, for, in spite of our very simple\r\ndiet and the plain living of the patients, we were always in debt; and\r\nwe had to make great efforts to raise money, holding even a little\r\nSale again before Christmas. This Sale was held in our own wards,\r\nthe patients being removed for a whole week, but we raised the two\r\nthousand, six hundred dollars which was the cost of our first year’s\r\nexperiment, not including the rent which was pledged, as already told.\r\n\r\nIt was a great oversight and much to be regretted, that we considered\r\nthis hospital experiment and ourselves of so little importance in\r\nthemselves that no printed report had been preserved until the year\r\n1868, that is, eleven years from the time we opened the Infirmary.\r\n\r\nI have also only very imperfect private notes, but I find that the\r\nexpense, all in all, including the board of the students, was a little\r\nover two thousand, six hundred dollars, from May 1, 1857, to May 1,\r\n1858; and that the average morning dispensary attendance was thirty;\r\nwhile the in-door patients were about one hundred during the year. But\r\nwe had a very large out-door practice, one of the four students alone,\r\nDr. Mary E. Breed, attending fourteen cases of childbed in one month;\r\nwhile I was often sent for in the night to assist them with advice when\r\ntheir knowledge was not sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe practical gain to these young women was so great that they were\r\nnot only devoted, hardworking and conscientious in their professional\r\nduties, but they were more than willing to bear great physical\r\ndiscomfort, as well as the ridicule which they encountered when they\r\nattempted to demand the recognition and the respect due to their\r\ncalling. Everywhere among the better situated people, they met with\r\ndiscouraging remarks and questions, giving evidence that the opinion\r\nwas that the practice of medicine by women would, in the course\r\nof time, be impossible, even if the present few were received as\r\nexceptions, or as the novelties of a fad. And the greatest tact was\r\ncalled for in accommodating ourselves and our work to the need of even\r\nthe poorest people.\r\n\r\nI may here describe one picture which memory recalls. Dr. Breed had\r\nbeen attending a difficult case of childbirth, in a negro quarter, and\r\nshe called on me for consultation and assistance.\r\n\r\nI entered a room which seemed filled with people of all sizes, and with\r\nfaces shading from pitch black through all colors to what seemed pure\r\nCaucasian. This latter was the woman in the corner, near the table on\r\nwhich stood the lamp, and she was just being delivered of a mulatto\r\nbaby by the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the swarm were both male and female, of whom the woman in\r\nthe corner claimed eight or more. We did not concern ourselves with the\r\nrelationship of the remainder, as they all seemed perfectly healthy and\r\ndid not require our attention. It seems to me that there must have been\r\nabout twenty-four persons in that room, to judge from the number of\r\nbeds and the air.\r\n\r\nWe medical women all went home together at about one o’clock in the\r\nmorning. It is strange to say but we had no fear about going to these\r\nsqualid places, and there really was no need of fear either.\r\n\r\nThe greatest politeness and attention was given to our students when\r\nthey were once accepted and, as in this case, the young doctor had to\r\nbe nurse and comforter during the whole day, as well as doctor at the\r\nmoment of crisis.\r\n\r\nShe felt quite safe during her stay and was provided with fresh\r\nmilk--which she drank from the tin can of the store in which it was\r\nbought; and she ate the pie from the paper in which it was wrapped. She\r\nfelt strong and at ease, and happy to have the opportunity to exercise\r\nher best influence during the twenty hours of her stay--which may or\r\nmay not have sowed some seed for the better.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, gratefulness was gained in more than one way, for this\r\nkind of people being more or less under the control of the police and\r\nof missionaries at large, did much to spread a good reputation for us\r\nand for our work. In this way, women physicians became known and sought\r\nby just the class in whom they were interested and among whom they\r\ndesired to work.\r\n\r\nThe need for the friendliness of the police towards us I can illustrate\r\nhere also. A woman died in the hospital after childbirth. We had\r\ninformed the many relations whom the poor and forsaken usually possess\r\nof the seriousness of the case. There was always one woman of the\r\nkinship at the bedside of the patient for about sixty hours before the\r\ndeath, which took place in the forenoon.\r\n\r\nIt was not an hour after this sad occurrence before all the cousins\r\nwho had relieved each other at the bedside appeared, with their male\r\ncousins or husbands in working attire and with pickaxes and shovels,\r\nbefore our street door, demanding admission and shouting that the\r\nfemale physicians who resided within were killing women in childbirth\r\nwith cold water.\r\n\r\nOf course, an immense crowd collected, filling the block between us and\r\nBroadway, hooting and yelling and trying to push in the doors, both on\r\nthe street and in the yard; so that we were beleaguered in such a way\r\nthat no communication with the outside was possible. We could not call\r\nto the people who were looking out of the windows in the neighboring\r\nhouses, our voices being drowned by the noise of the mob.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture the policeman who had charge of Bleecker Street and\r\nthe one from Broadway came running up to the scene. On learning the\r\ncomplaint of the men, they commanded silence and ordered the crowd to\r\ndisperse, telling them that they knew the doctors in that hospital\r\ntreated the patients in the best possible way, and that no doctor could\r\nkeep everybody from dying some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n _Social success--Growth of private practice--Professional\r\n recognition--Consulting staff of leading medical men for\r\n Infirmary--Occasional opening of some dispensary clinics to women\r\n students who there introduce a needed reform--Incident of Dr. J.\r\n Marion Sims, and why a woman was not appointed assistant surgeon\r\n in the New York Woman’s Hospital of which he was chief--Second\r\n mobbing of the Infirmary following death of a patient--Definite\r\n beginning of training of nurses--Trying experience of two fires in\r\n neighborhood--Dr. Zakrzewska’s health begins to show effects of\r\n overstrain--Inquiring visitors from all parts of the United States and\r\n even from England. (Twenty-nine years of age: 1857-1859.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1857-1858, our entrance into the social circles\r\nalready mentioned was an immense help to the spreading of the idea of\r\nwomen physicians through our meeting what was then called the “higher\r\nkind of Bohemians,” among whom were preëminently women artists,\r\naspiring journalists and dramatic students. Although we medical women\r\nwere not cordially accepted, as only a few of them dared to make our\r\nacquaintance, our repeated weekly appearances (as one or more of us\r\nmade it a point to attend these receptions, no matter how tired we\r\nwere) familiarized these small publics with the thought that women\r\ndoctors are as good as anybody.\r\n\r\nThe fashion then was to attend these “socials” regularly; and\r\n_social_ they became. They were not stiff and meaningless as is\r\nthe present fashion, where one goes once or twice during the whole\r\nseason, shakes hands with the hosts, says some nothings, meets friends\r\nand foes and says more nothings, shakes many hands without knowing why,\r\nand takes some refreshment in thimble cups, which is no refreshment\r\nso scanty is it in quantity and so poor in quality, mere elegant\r\nnothings only pretty to look upon. No; in those years, receptions meant\r\nintellectual recognition, social grace, conversation, and enjoyment in\r\nwhatever suited the different tastes, whether a song, or some music, or\r\na quiet game of whist in a retired corner; and no “refreshment” to make\r\na show of pretense, but simply plenty of good ice water.\r\n\r\nAmong these good people, of whom many have since become of eminence in\r\nliterature and in art, we gradually developed professionally a small\r\nclientele who, if not paying in lucre, paid with grateful remembrance\r\nin speaking of us, spreading the idea of us and occasionally writing\r\nlittle articles concerning the New York Infirmary for the leading\r\npapers and journals.\r\n\r\nI much regret not to be in possession of any of these writings for, as\r\nI remember them now, they seem to me so juvenile, so absolutely simple\r\nin their tenor, that it might appeal to our sense of humor to read them\r\nin the present altered position of women physicians.\r\n\r\nFor instance, the public was assured that none of us wore short\r\nhair like men, but dressed gracefully within the fashion; that we\r\nappeared neat in costume, nothing extraordinary indicating our calling,\r\netc., etc. The only disagreeable thing which they found in us was\r\nthat we objected to being called “Doctress,” but insisted upon the\r\nneutral appellation of “Doctor of Medicine.” This led even to lengthy\r\ndiscussions as to “whether the English language would conform to such a\r\ntitle for a woman.”\r\n\r\nHowever, this publicity helped “the Cause” and, strange to say,\r\nmen were the first who took to the innovation of employing a woman\r\nphysician by advising their daughters and wives to avail themselves of\r\nour services.\r\n\r\nThus, at the end of the year 1857, I had quite a comfortable private\r\npractice established. And I took great pains to assure those to whose\r\nfamilies I ministered that, year by year, an increase of better women\r\ndoctors would be the consequence of widening their practical experience\r\nand giving them equality of opportunity with the men physicians.\r\n\r\nHere my notes read very sanguine, as some of the men highest in\r\nprofessional standing were exceedingly friendly, both professionally\r\nand privately; and it is with deep gratitude that I mention the names\r\nof Drs. Kissam, Willard Parker, McCready, Aigner and Buck, who gave us\r\ntheir most cordial assistance.\r\n\r\nDr. Kissam, a prominent obstetrician, was on our consulting staff and\r\nhe became quite friendly to our students, though still believing that\r\nDr. Blackwell and I were exceptions to all womankind. Dr. McCready,\r\nattending physician at Bellevue Hospital, was another one who had put\r\naside prejudice. The influence of these men procured for our students\r\nattendance at some of the larger dispensaries. In one, the Eastern\r\nDispensary, Dr. Aigner, one of the Austrian exiles and a man of high\r\neducation, took a sincere interest in the whole movement.\r\n\r\nWhen our students expressed their surprise that no books of patients\r\nwere kept in these large and rich institutions, no records of cases\r\nor prescriptions retained, in fact, that no methodical system was\r\nfollowed, these men inquired into our doings and came and looked\r\nthrough our system, by means of which every patient could be\r\ntraced--the name, residence, diagnosis, treatment and subsequent\r\ncourse. This was a revelation to them; as it was further when I told\r\nthem that I never allowed in out-door practice any student to give\r\na prescription without signing her name to it. Thus, in case of any\r\nquestion being raised as to mistake in the prescription or mistake by\r\nthe druggist (who was by no means in those years always a professional\r\nperson in that line, but often a mere business man who opened an\r\napothecary store), this signature would always tell where to place the\r\nresponsibility for the writing of the prescription.\r\n\r\nAt that time I did not realize, as I do now, that these men, like all\r\nthose whose position is fully established both professionally and\r\nfinancially, could afford to step outside the pale of professional\r\ncustom and take up what was not recognized in the strict sense of\r\ncommon daily life.\r\n\r\nIt is the insecure, struggling physician who is hostile to the woman\r\ninnovator, actually fearing for his bread and butter much more than\r\nfor any alleged inferiority of intellect or of professional skill in\r\nthe woman, although these latter have always been used as the war cry\r\nagainst women doctors.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Medical and Surgical Journal_, Feb. 16, 1853,\r\nexpresses this point of view in an editorial on female physicians,\r\napropos of Dr. Hunt’s receiving an honorary degree of M.D. from the\r\nFemale Medical College of Pennsylvania. It says:\r\n\r\n It is not a matter to be laughed down as readily as was at first\r\n anticipated. The serious inroads made by female physicians in\r\n obstetrical business, one of the essential branches of income to a\r\n majority of well-established practitioners, makes it natural enough to\r\n inquire what course it is best to pursue.\r\n\r\nAmong the young men at that time, Dr. J. Marion Sims played such a\r\npeculiar rôle and one which is so characteristic that I must relate it\r\nhere. Dr. Sims had come from the South to New York in 1853, poor and\r\nunknown. He had perfected an important operation which was based on a\r\nGerman theory, but for which no material to practice on could be found\r\neither in Europe or America, until he was able to utilize the negro\r\nslave women. Dr. Sims quotes “the great Würtzer, of Germany”; and he\r\ntold me by word of mouth that he had operated one hundred and eleven\r\ntimes before he had the first success. This first success followed the\r\nperformance of the thirtieth operation upon one of the six or seven\r\nslave women upon whom he had unlimited freedom for experimentation.\r\n\r\nAs it happened, Dr. Sims was introduced into the same social circle in\r\nwhich we were acquainted, and learning from certain members that they\r\nwere enthusiastically interested in women physicians, he advanced in\r\na year’s time in such a friendly manner that he had hard work to live\r\ndown his friendly advances when he later learned from his professional\r\nbrethren, as well as from a wider public, that women physicians were\r\nby no means popular and could in no way forward his plans. However, he\r\nremained outwardly polite to the Drs. Blackwell and myself, inviting\r\nus to his operations in the then small beginning of the Woman’s\r\nHospital, but excusing himself from further assistance to medical\r\nwomen as a hindrance to the philanthropic enterprise of enlarging the\r\nabove-mentioned institution.\r\n\r\nDr. Sims stood on common ground with the women physicians in that he\r\nalso found the medical profession unfriendly, and realized that his\r\nonly hope of establishing himself was to open a hospital for himself.\r\nHe says in his autobiography, which was published under the title of\r\n_The Story of My Life_, “I said to myself, ‘I am a lost man unless\r\nI can get somebody to create a place in which I can show the world what\r\nI am capable of doing.’ This was the inception of the idea of a woman’s\r\nhospital.... If the profession had received me kindly in New York and\r\nhad acted honorably and gentlemanly and generously towards me, I would\r\nnot have thought of building a woman’s hospital.... When I left Alabama\r\nfor New York, I had no idea of the sort in the world. I came simply for\r\na purpose the most unselfish in the world--that of prolonging my life.”\r\n\r\nWhile no more fortunate than the women physicians in enlisting the\r\ncoöperation of the medical profession, Dr. Sims had greater success\r\nwith some prominent and wealthy women, who eventually established the\r\nhospital for him. The work of Dr. Blackwell and the movement in favor\r\nof women physicians had evidently made an impression upon these women\r\nalso, because they adopted a by-law providing that “the assistant\r\nsurgeon should be a woman”; and Dr. Blackwell and her sister, Dr.\r\nEmily, both well-qualified by their added clinical training in Europe,\r\nwere the logical candidates for this position.\r\n\r\nDr. Sims cynically refers to this by-law as follows: “One clause of\r\nthe by-laws provided that the assistant surgeon should be a woman. I\r\nappointed Mrs. Browne, a widowed sister of my friend, Henri L. Stuart,\r\nwho had been so efficient in organizing the hospital. She was matron\r\nand general superintendent.”\r\n\r\nSix months later, he told the board of lady managers that he must have\r\nan assistant. He then offered this position, successively, to two young\r\nmen who had just been graduated and who declined it. His third choice\r\nwas made because the man had married a young Southern friend of his\r\nyouth!\r\n\r\nReturning to the friendly physicians mentioned above, they dared\r\nto introduce our students into their dispensary clinics, and they\r\ngave clinical instruction to us at the Infirmary, thus helping on\r\ngratuitously the few women who were struggling faithfully to fit\r\nthemselves for their responsible calling. It was the more estimable\r\nin these men that their audience was a small one whenever they came\r\nto our hospital during the winter evenings, the largest number never\r\nexceeding six. And they were always ready to come in consultation, even\r\nif they were requested to attend the same case repeatedly.\r\n\r\nMy heart is still full of joy when I think how kind and helpful these\r\nmen were in protecting us in this way; and even, also, against brutal\r\nassault, as, for instance, in a case of appendicitis to which Dr.\r\nKissam had been every other day in consultation and which ended in\r\ndeath. His advice had been the application of cold water compresses,\r\nwhich were in vogue at that time.\r\n\r\nOn the morning following the day on which the patient died, a number\r\nof men appeared before the Infirmary, demanding entrance and creating\r\nwithin ten minutes a large mob to whom they were talking loudly,\r\ndeclaring that this was an institution of some cranky women who killed\r\npeople with cold water. I had found means for sending a messenger from\r\nthe back door to Dr. Kissam, and it was through his presence that no\r\nharm was done to the institution. He addressed the mob and advised the\r\ndisturbed people to have a coroner sent for to make an examination\r\nin the presence of twelve of themselves as a jury. It was a sight\r\nto behold--these poor distraught men in overalls, with dirty hands,\r\ndisheveled hair and grim faces, standing by during the autopsy, and\r\nat its close, declaring their satisfaction that death had been an\r\nunavoidable consequence of the disease.\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day, 1858, was one of the brightest and pleasantest winter\r\ndays we ever enjoyed. A friend to women physicians had placed money in\r\nmy hands for gifts to our faithful servants; and another friend sold to\r\nme at half price a whole piece of thibet, so that I was able to present\r\neach one of my hardworking women with a dress, as well as with some\r\nsweetmeats, all of which were duly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nobody, nowadays, can understand the willingness and devotion\r\nof the women who assisted me in carrying on this primitive little\r\nhospital: who were willing to work hard, in and out of hours; who fared\r\nextremely plainly and lodged almost to uncomfortableness; yet who felt\r\nthat a good work was being accomplished for all womankind. And this was\r\ntrue of all--students, nurses and domestic help.\r\n\r\nThe eight months of experiment had stimulated us all with great hope\r\nfor the future, and we now began to make more positive plans for\r\nthe education and training of nurses. The first two who presented\r\nthemselves for this training were superior women, one a German, the\r\nother an American, but neither was willing to give a longer time than\r\nfour months, during which they received no compensation except their\r\nkeeping and one weekly lesson from me on the different branches of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nAfter these left, it was again a German woman who presented herself,\r\nand who, after four months’ training, remained as head nurse for\r\nseveral years. The second pupil nurse was sometimes of American,\r\nsometimes of Irish, descent and nothing remarkable.\r\n\r\nThis whole year had nothing special to note except that the press\r\nbegan to take a little more favorable notice of our doings and was\r\nready to speak in favor of a Fair which again was arranged for at\r\nthe end of the year; and this publicity spread the idea of women’s\r\ncompetency to take care of sick people.\r\n\r\nWe had constant applications from students to share in the experience\r\nof practice which we offered, and who were willing to live outside in\r\norder to attend the dispensary; while the number of patients in daily\r\nattendance at this latter increased so rapidly that we had to establish\r\nthe rule of locking the door against admission after a certain hour.\r\n\r\nAmong the applicants were all sorts of extremists--such as women\r\nin very short Bloomer costume, with hair cut also very short, to\r\nwhom the patients objected most strenuously; others were training\r\nas practitioners in a water-cure establishment, and wished to avail\r\nthemselves of our out-door practice in order to introduce their\r\ntheories and methods of healing. In fact, we were overrun with advisers\r\nand helpers whom we had to refuse. Popular prejudices could be overcome\r\nonly in the most careful and conservative manner; and even our most\r\nardent friends and supporters shared to a certain degree in the feeling\r\nof uncertainty as to the success of our experiment.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I received during this year great comfort in the\r\nacquaintances and lifelong friendships gained. And the recollection\r\nof these friends calls forth such a deep feeling of gratitude for\r\ntheir devotion in our work of love, and for their trust in me, and of\r\nadmiration for their high purpose to serve humanity, that I consider\r\nit worth while to have lived if for no other reason than to realize\r\nthrough them the goodness of womankind.\r\n\r\nSo the year closed upon us as one which had brought great satisfaction\r\nin all we expected to gain, professionally and as bearers of a new\r\nidea. Youth was with us all, and our hopes of success knew no limit. We\r\nwere the happiest, even if materially the poorest, of a group of women\r\nwhich included friends engaged in different lines of work, such as\r\njournalism, art and music. Of these, none identified herself so closely\r\nwith us as Mary L. Booth, later editor of _Harper’s Bazar_, who\r\nspent every Sunday with us, and who often shared my room and bed when\r\nshe was out at night as reporter of the New York _Times_ too late\r\nto return to her home in Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nOh! happy days! Springtime of life! It was the “May” which never\r\nreturns to the human being, and the beauty of which we realize only\r\nlong after it has passed. Memories of these glorious days keep with\r\nus and reconcile us to the many sad, dark, anxious and trying hours\r\nthrough which we all have to pass in one form or another. These latter\r\nmake us wiser, perhaps, but certainly not happier, even though we have\r\nstruggled successfully through the years and feel that we should be\r\ncontented with what we have accomplished.\r\n\r\nStill, there was a dark side to my experience during that year. The\r\nsick headaches, to which I had been subject off and on since childhood,\r\ncame upon me quite often and very unexpectedly, evidently due to the\r\noverstraining of all my forces, physical and mental, and I was quite\r\noften obliged to relinquish some very important duties.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this year’s record, I must add a few remarks concerning\r\nour work, that is, mine and that of the ten or twelve students who had\r\nbeen connected with the Infirmary now for twenty months.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against women physicians was by no means confined to that\r\nstratum of society where education and wealth nurtured the young. We\r\nfound it just as strong, through habit and custom, among the working\r\npeople and among the very poorest of the poor. Their coming to our\r\ndispensary was not _a priori_ appreciation of the woman physician,\r\nbut was the result of faith in the _extraordinary_, just as now\r\nfaith-curers with other claims are sought and consulted in illness.\r\n\r\nOur work was that of real missionaries. Even among the well-to-do and\r\nintelligent, little or nothing was known of hygiene. If “a goneness in\r\nthe stomach” was felt, whisky, brandy or a strong tonic was resorted\r\nto for relief. Diet, rest and the sensible use of water were never\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nSo among the poor we found everywhere bad air, filth and utter\r\ndisregard of food. And sponges, as well as soap, were carried in the\r\nsatchels of our young medical women along with the necessary implements\r\nof the physician. And the former were given to the patients’ friends,\r\nafter showing them the use of water and soap in fever cases as well as\r\nin ordinary illness. It was an innovation in the minds of the people,\r\nthe teaching that sick people must be bathed and kept clean, and that\r\nfresh air was not killing.\r\n\r\nThe good results obtained by the addition of these sanitary auxiliaries\r\nwhose use was permitted only through our persuasion, created almost a\r\nsuperstitious faith in us and resulted in sending to us patients from\r\na distance of ten and twelve miles from Bleecker Street. This made\r\nincreased demands on our physical and nervous powers, for we made it a\r\npoint not to refuse any person if it were at all possible to see her.\r\n\r\nThus we placed foundation stones here and there all over Manhattan\r\nIsland upon which to build our superstructure of medical practice by\r\nwomen. In this respect, as in all solid production in nature and in\r\ncivilization, a sound foundation must be created first. No reform,\r\nno culture can be successful if we limit ourselves to the higher\r\nintellects. We must under all conditions be careful not to speak over\r\nthe heads of the mentally mediocre crowd.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which the seed is sown must be examined, then prepared, and\r\nthen cultivated in the most prudent and careful manner--only then can\r\nwe expect to have the seed take root and grow.\r\n\r\nThe gaining of confidence is not obtained by showing your own\r\nsuperiority; nay, it is by hiding this latter and allowing the persons\r\nwhom you want to benefit to think well of themselves, yet continuing\r\nto lead them, indirectly, to the idea that there is a possibility of\r\ntheir bettering themselves. Only by such a proceeding is it possible\r\nto bring about confidence; then an attachment follows and, finally, a\r\ndependence upon your higher wisdom which will always end in admiration\r\nand gratitude. Whenever this is not the case, it shows failure in our\r\nhaving been wise, or kind, or comprehending of the situation; in\r\nshort, it is the fault of the would-be benefactor.\r\n\r\nWe had two strange accidents in the neighborhood during that year. Our\r\nbackyard and outbuildings faced the rear of a livery stable containing\r\nmore than forty horses. This stable took fire one afternoon about five\r\no’clock. I was just coming home, and I felt so sure of the solidity of\r\nour own buildings that I was able to control the excitement of all our\r\ninmates who, in bed and out of bed, were perfectly quiet and remained\r\nin their rooms in spite of the smoke and noise and all the confusion\r\nwhich a large fire causes.\r\n\r\nA few months later at four o’clock in the morning, I was just retiring\r\nto my room after having attended a patient below when I heard the cry\r\nof “Fire!” And looking out of my window, I saw that a man had upset a\r\nfluid lamp, filling the whole room with flames, while he with his night\r\nshirt on fire was seeking to escape through the door which he could\r\nnot find, thus burning to death before my eyes. It was an appalling\r\nspectacle, and before I could really comprehend the situation, firemen\r\nappeared and worked hard, for the conflagration soon included several\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\nAgain, I could control my patients and the other inmates, although our\r\nstudents and servants dressed hastily and were ready to obey commands\r\nin case of need. Fortunately for us, the wind blew the flames in the\r\nopposite direction from our house, and I trusted in this fact. Had I\r\nhad the experience of the Chicago and Boston conflagrations, I would\r\nnot have trusted to the wind nor perhaps have been able to control\r\na family of nearly forty heads. Such is the blessing of youthful\r\ninexperience! But the strain of anxiety on these two occasions was\r\ntremendous, and I was laid up each time for a couple of days with a\r\nsevere sick headache.\r\n\r\nVisitors interested in women physicians came from all parts of the\r\nUnited States as well as from England, but especially from Boston. I\r\nwas often at the same time amused and pained when disappointment was\r\nexpressed over the smallness of our hospital, and we had to take great\r\npains to explain our out-door department work.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, I had instituted record books in which the\r\nname, age, residence, occupation, diagnosis and treatment of every\r\nindividual case were written--of those who were in the hospital, those\r\nwho came to the dispensary clinics, and those who were attended at\r\ntheir homes.\r\n\r\nThese books revealed to the visitors our activity, and they were\r\nadmired also by our professional brethren. No such records then existed\r\nin their dispensaries but were introduced after our example, primitive\r\nas it was in those years. However, having such records saved us a great\r\ndeal of annoyance in many ways, as we offered them for inspection to\r\nall whom they concerned; and they protected us against any accusation\r\nof carelessness, ignorance or malpractice of any kind.\r\n\r\nIt was the same with the prescriptions given when the medicines were\r\nnot provided by us. I insisted that every one who wrote a prescription\r\nshould sign her name, if not also the name of the patient. As my name\r\nwas so long, I have always signed _M. E. Z._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n _Dr. Blackwell goes to England for vacation--Dr. Zakrzewska’s health\r\n suffers under increased strain--Goes to Boston for vacation--Is there\r\n urged to become professor of obstetrics in the New England Female\r\n Medical College, and to establish a hospital for this college--Accepts\r\n offer and removes to Boston. (Twenty-nine years of age: 1859.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Year’s Day, 1859, was a very cold one, bleak winds prevailing\r\nafter a snowstorm. A number of invitations were extended to us by\r\nfriends, who did not simply array their houses for callers bringing\r\ntheir congratulations in Dutch fashion and receiving the customary\r\nrefreshments. I decided to accept the hospitality of Mrs. and Mr. Booth\r\nin Williamsburg, the home of our friend and companion, Mary L. Booth,\r\nwhile the rest of the household was treated to a dinner of roast goose\r\nwhich kind patrons had provided. We never could have thought of such\r\nluxuries ourselves, nor on Thanksgiving Day nor Christmas, either.\r\nHowever, we never suffered for the want of them--they always appeared\r\nin due time on these holidays.\r\n\r\nThis furnishes proof that it is a pleasure to be kind and that there\r\nare more good people in the world than we may realize. If only one half\r\nof humanity could be brought into absolute contact individually with\r\nthe other half which is neglected, degraded and discouraged, there\r\nis no doubt that we would witness the same equalization in the large\r\ncities as that which prevails in the country towns and villages. Not\r\nthat there is no difference of subsistence in these latter, but the\r\nabsolute poverty is not to be found in them as we find it in the former.\r\n\r\nDr. Elizabeth Blackwell now went to England for a vacation and to visit\r\nold friends. Her absence caused an increase in work and responsibility,\r\nas Dr. Emily and myself had to divide the work which she had done in\r\nthe dispensary. This increase was just the little more which I could\r\nnot bear, and the sick headaches returned so often and with such\r\nviolence that I had to relinquish a good deal of supervision to my head\r\nnurse, and finally I was obliged to keep to my bed for a whole week.\r\n\r\nWhen they were visiting the Infirmary, the Boston friends of woman’s\r\nmedical education, of whom I have spoken, had kindly asked me to visit\r\nthem. So I concluded to take a short vacation in February, placing my\r\nsenior students in charge of the medical work, under the supervision of\r\nDr. Emily Blackwell.\r\n\r\nMy visit to Boston, towards the last of February, was exceedingly\r\ninteresting. I found that Mr. Samuel E. Sewall, as well as his\r\nassociate directors of the _New England Female Medical College_,\r\nhad been anxious to add a clinical department to their purely\r\ntheoretical school.\r\n\r\nAnd outside friends, who had become interested in me personally as well\r\nas in my plans to aid the education of medical women by training them\r\nin practical work, also were anxious that I should change my place of\r\nresidence from New York to Boston and accept the position of organizer\r\nof this clinical department.\r\n\r\nThe impression which I received when first visiting Boston in 1856\r\nwas deepened. And it was exceedingly favorable as to the earnestness\r\nof all the women with whom I came in contact, and as to their desire\r\nto elevate the education of womankind in general and in medicine\r\nespecially. I felt that a larger field for my efforts might be opened\r\nthere in connection with a medical school rather than in New York where\r\nthe two Drs. Blackwell controlled the direction of efforts towards what\r\nseemed to them wisest and best.\r\n\r\nBesides, the financial condition of the Infirmary was improving so\r\nsteadily that the services which I had been rendering gratuitously\r\ncould now be hired; while the medical applicants were of an unusual\r\ntalent and more and more willing to make arrangements for a longer\r\nperiod of service with increased responsibilities, although they still\r\nhad to pay their expenses.\r\n\r\nAlso, my private practice had increased to such an extent that I was\r\nfree from debt, having repaid all loans advanced to me during my\r\nstudies save the two hundred dollars which the Cleveland society had\r\nexpended towards my first year. This, I could not now repay as the\r\nsociety had dissolved. But I kept this amount to loan to poor students,\r\nwithout note or interest. Some repaid the loan of fifty dollars or one\r\nhundred dollars from time to time; others, not able perhaps to do so,\r\nare still holding it, and I am unable to say positively who they are\r\nas I did not record the names. I am only sure that these amounts, and\r\nsome more, are in their hands. The first one to whom I loaned the whole\r\ntwo hundred dollars was Dr. Susan Dimock, when she was going to Europe\r\nto study, she repaying it before she made that fatal trip abroad in\r\n1875.\r\n\r\nAll these considerations influenced me when Boston’s liberal friends\r\nof women, or of “the Cause,” as it was styled, offered me the position\r\nof organizer and head of the clinical department which they were ready\r\nto establish. And the directors of the medical college offered me the\r\nchair of obstetrics in that school, which being my specialty had great\r\nattraction for me.\r\n\r\nAfter hesitating for a long time as to what course to pursue, I went\r\nto Boston in the spring to define in a public address my views and\r\nposition in respect to the study of medicine. I found so great a desire\r\nprevailing for the elevation of the medical college for women to the\r\nstandard of the male medical colleges and such enthusiasm in respect\r\nto the proposed hospital, that I felt a great desire to make the new\r\nhospital department as useful to the public and to the students as the\r\nNew York Infirmary had become.\r\n\r\nThe chance of being able to carry out my own plans of work instead of\r\nbeing simply assistant to the Drs. Blackwell was a final temptation,\r\nand after inquiries and consultations with Dr. Emily I decided in\r\nMay to accept the offered position and to remove at once to Boston.\r\nMy decision was aided by two facts: the first, that Dr. Blackwell’s\r\nabsence had proved that the Infirmary could be sustained by two\r\ndoctors, not only without loss but with a continuance of its steady\r\nincrease, this latter being the consequence of the good already done\r\nto the community through its ministrations. And the second was that my\r\nhealth was becoming uncertain under the strain of the work which, by\r\nvirtue of necessity as well as of habit, would remain my share in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nHaving fulfilled my promise of contribution to the Infirmary of two\r\nyears’ gratuitous services and having put everything in order and\r\ndivided the duties which I had been discharging, I left the Infirmary\r\non June 1, 1859, taking a short vacation in New York but arriving in\r\nBoston on the sixth, as I found to my great disappointment that no\r\nshort vacation would bring back the strength which I had wasted in my\r\nzeal to advance “the Cause” more rapidly than the law of evolution\r\npermits.\r\n\r\nThus ended my New York career. I left feeling that I could be spared,\r\nalthough the breaking up of several true friendships saddened the\r\ndeparture. Of all the friends, Mary L. Booth was the dearest to me. It\r\nis not through blood kinship that we feel the strongest; nay, we may\r\neven feel no affinity at all towards the sisters and brothers we so\r\nlove, while the few kindred spirits we meet fill our souls with life\r\nand inspiration.\r\n\r\nThe few friends to whom I was thus sincerely attached remained such for\r\nlife, and the professional affinities stand to-day in the same relation\r\nto me as when we were young, while a few non-professional New York\r\nfriends find time and opportunity to meet me occasionally to exchange\r\nreminiscences of the golden days of our youth.\r\n\r\nAbout this date, there were already a goodly number of women upon whom\r\nthe degree of M.D. had been legally conferred, but the minds of those\r\nwho understood the conditions which prevailed were far from being\r\nsatisfied with results.\r\n\r\nRecognition in the profession and opportunities for a good education\r\nfor others who wished to cultivate this field of labor were our aims.\r\nAnd so we labored on, the Drs. Blackwell and myself in New York and Dr.\r\nAnn Preston in Philadelphia--the latter for the “college,” and all the\r\nformer for the “hospital” education of female students.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a number of spurious institutions proclaiming the same aim\r\nhad sprung up like weeds which threatened to choke the wheat in the\r\nfield. After the interest of a few high-minded male physicians had\r\nbeen secured, the battle with and against these institutions had to be\r\nfought--and it is still to be fought.\r\n\r\nThe best of these secondary institutions existed in Boston, and it\r\nwas thither that I was going with the hopefulness which befits the\r\nmissionary spirit.\r\n\r\n[As has been elsewhere stated, most of the preceding chapters were\r\nwritten by Dr. Zakrzewska in a letter to her friend, Miss Mary L.\r\nBooth, in New York. And she closes this letter with the paragraphs\r\nwhich follow.]\r\n\r\n ... I could not refrain from writing fully of this part of my life\r\n which has been the object of all my undertakings, and for which I have\r\n borne trials and overcome difficulties which would have crushed nine\r\n out of ten in my position. I do not expect that this will be the end\r\n of my usefulness; but I do expect that I shall not have to write to\r\n you any more of my doings. It was simply in order that you, my friend,\r\n should understand me fully, and because you have so often expressed\r\n a wish to know my life before we met, that I finished this letter.\r\n Now you have me externally and internally, past and present. And,\r\n although there have been many influences besides which have made their\r\n impressions on my peculiar development, yet they are not of a nature\r\n to be spoken of as facts, as, for instance, your friendship for me.\r\n\r\n On looking back upon my past life, I may say that I am like a fine\r\n ship that, launched upon high seas, is tossed about by the winds and\r\n waves and steered against contrary currents until finally stranded\r\n upon the shore. There, from the materials a small boat is built, just\r\n strong enough to reach the port into which the ship had expected to\r\n enter with proudly swelling sails. But this ambition is entirely gone\r\n and I care now very little whether or not people recognize what is in\r\n me, so long as the object for which I have lived becomes a reality.\r\n\r\n And now, my good friend, I must add one wish before I send these last\r\n few pages to you, namely, that I may be enabled some day to go with\r\n you to Berlin to show you the scenes in which my childhood and youth\r\n were passed, and to teach you on the spot the difference between\r\n Europe and America. All other inducements to return have vanished.\r\n Nearly all the men who aided in promoting my wishes have passed away,\r\n and the only stimulus that now remains to make me want to revisit the\r\n home of my youth, is the wish to wander about there with you and\r\n perhaps with two or three other of my American friends. Until this can\r\n be accomplished, I hope to continue my present work in the New England\r\n Female Medical College which, though by no means yet what we wish it\r\n to be, is deserving of every effort to raise it to the position that\r\n it ought to take among the medical institutions of America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n _Details of the College building--Dr. Zakrzewska meets many\r\n men and women leaders in advanced thought in Boston--Differences\r\n between Boston and New York with regard to the question of “woman’s\r\n sphere”--History of the New England Female Medical College--She finds\r\n the educational standards of the College low, and she meets opposition\r\n in her attempts to elevate them--She establishes the hospital\r\n (Clinical Department) along lines similar to those she had developed\r\n in the New York Infirmary--Several leading men in the profession\r\n acknowledge her qualifications but refuse to act as consultants\r\n for the hospital, or to countenance the College--Letters from Dr.\r\n John Ware--Hardships of the Out-Practice. (Thirty years of age:\r\n 1859-1860.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New England Female Medical College had its home in Springfield\r\nStreet, in the building erected for the Boston Lying-In Hospital and\r\nlater occupied by the Home for Aged Men. Here the lectures were held,\r\nthe officers had their rooms and the directors, their meetings; and\r\nyet, not half of the building was occupied. So I had there my office\r\nand bedroom, furnished by the lady managers of the college.\r\n\r\nI assigned the basement rooms to the dispensary, while the rest of the\r\nlower rooms served for domestic purposes inclusive of servants’ rooms.\r\nThe middle story was taken for the indoor clinical department, or\r\nhospital; while the upper floor, or attic, was arranged for students’\r\nchambers, and for these we received rent and pay for board from those\r\nactively serving in the hospital department.\r\n\r\nThis whole affair, however, had to be organized and superintended, and\r\nas I felt unequal to added medical responsibilities I devoted myself\r\nduring the whole summer (1859) to arranging this department and getting\r\nit in working order, taking every now and then a whole week’s vacation\r\nat the seashore or in the country.\r\n\r\nNew friends in the form of a board of lady managers were added to\r\nthe college because increased funds were needed to carry on the new\r\ndepartment, the most noted name on this board being that of Harriet\r\nBeecher Stowe. And the ladies and gentlemen who favored my plans when\r\nI came, three years earlier, pleading for the New York Infirmary, now\r\nbravely advanced and provided the means for this new enterprise.\r\n\r\nThrough all of my former acquaintances I at once found warm friends and\r\nprotectors here in our beloved city of Boston. I may mention the names\r\nof Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Samuel E.\r\nSewall, F. W. G. May, Francis Jackson, Rev. William E. Channing, Dr. W.\r\nF. Channing, Dr. Samuel Cabot, Dr. E. H. Clark, Mrs. Sarah S. Russell,\r\nMiss Abby G. May, Miss Lucy Goddard, Rev. and Mrs. James F. Clarke, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Bond, Miss Mary J. Parkman, Mrs. R. G. Shaw, Mrs. Ednah D.\r\nCheney, Mrs. F. Fenno Tudor, Miss Susan Carey--and there were a host of\r\nothers, both men and women.\r\n\r\nI wish I could mention all of the noble minds, pioneers of a new era\r\nin the broadening of thought. No specialism was represented, except\r\nperhaps that of Abolitionism and the Advancement of Women. Free scope\r\nof the intellect was admitted, and every one who promoted culture of\r\nmind and body was welcomed. Scores of able women sought instruction,\r\ndemanding to know what was objectionable in woman’s aspirations.\r\n\r\nThese and other activities were evidences of the smoldering volcano\r\nwhich burst forth into active conflagration in the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War, in 1861, and which gave birth to a new type of Woman--as\r\nMinerva was said to have issued forth from the head of Zeus fully armed\r\nwith weapons of force and intellect.\r\n\r\nThe names of Lucy Goddard, Abby May, Ednah D. Cheney, Sarah Shaw\r\nRussell and Anna Lowell should be engraved on plates of gold for\r\nremembrance by those who will come after, for they took a stand which\r\nmade history in life, and especially in the life of women.\r\n\r\nFor, let it be understood, the impression of the great liberality of\r\nBoston society, which I had cherished and fostered as a belief, was\r\nnot as well-founded as I thought, and upon closer acquaintance I was\r\nsoon convinced that here also it required a great deal of courage to\r\nadvocate a new era in woman’s sphere.\r\n\r\nAlthough I found much less tendency to ridicule, to treat with\r\ncontempt, or to prophesy failure than we had met in New York, yet\r\nthe fear of losing social caste was strong here also. Declarations\r\nthat the study of medicine would unsex girls or break down health and\r\nbeauty prevailed throughout the community, and newspaper remarks were\r\ndiscouraging rather than otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn short, I had to go over the same ground as in New York, explaining\r\nthe possibility of a woman physician’s being able to do precisely the\r\nsame work as the average man physician. The only difference I found in\r\nthe two cities was that in spite of doubt and prejudice against woman\r\n“leaving her sphere,” as it was called, intelligent men and women in\r\nBoston were ready to listen to and to discuss all possible chances.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this small medical college for women had now lived for\r\nnearly ten years induced the liberal-minded to go a step farther and to\r\nbegin to employ women, especially in midwifery cases.\r\n\r\nOne of the graduates of this school was still practicing in Boston as\r\nmidwife on July 1, 1889, she having by that time attended five thousand\r\nconfinement cases. Although she was never sought by the well-paying\r\nportion of the Boston community, she held a very reputable position\r\namong her patients and among such of the profession as had business\r\nrelations with her. Her name, Mrs. Hassenfuss, has been mentioned to me\r\nquite often by the best of men physicians. Therefore, honor to whom it\r\nbelongs. This good, sensible woman, the mother of eleven children, has\r\ndone her share in overcoming prejudice against women physicians.\r\n\r\nSeveral other ladies who had graduated from this school tried to\r\npractice in Boston although as they told me with very little financial\r\nresult. They were obliged during the first years after establishing\r\nthemselves to seek practical experience among the poor, either as\r\nassistant to a friendly man physician or on their own responsibility.\r\nIn either case, they appeared to the people’s minds more like\r\nwell-trained nurses than physicians who assume an authority which\r\ncreates confidence. Their position was by no means an enviable one, and\r\nonly the self-assurance produced by the American education could hold\r\nthem up socially.\r\n\r\nHere it should be said that the graduates of this school labored\r\nunder disadvantages produced by obscurities in the minds of those who\r\ncontrolled it.\r\n\r\nEver since the men physicians began to organize themselves into a\r\ncompact body or guild, their endeavor has been not to educate the women\r\nwhom they everywhere found called to be the natural obstetricians, but\r\nto drive them entirely out of such practice and to monopolize it for\r\nthemselves. This struggle continues everywhere, all over the world.\r\nAnd it is a struggle which will continue until both men and women are\r\neducated equally well, so that the individual patient may exercise her\r\nchoice of the “trained doctor” of either sex.\r\n\r\nA public agitation begun in Boston in the summer of 1847 culminated in\r\n1848 in a revulsion of feeling among the laity against this attempt of\r\nthe male physicians to monopolize the practice of obstetrics, and in\r\nfavor of the restoration of at least a part of such practice to the\r\nhands of women. And this revolt was countenanced by a large number of\r\nthe leading citizens of Boston as well as of the rest of New England.\r\n\r\nAs a result of this agitation, the _Boston Female Medical School_\r\nwas opened on November 1, 1848, with twelve pupils. And to aid this\r\nSchool, the _Female Medical Education Society_ was organized on\r\nNovember 23, 1848, with six members. This membership increased to a\r\nthousand or more during the following year, its larger part consisting\r\nof men of prominence in all walks of life. And in the following year,\r\n1850, this society was incorporated “for the purpose of providing for\r\nthe education of Midwives, Nurses, and Female Physicians.”\r\n\r\nIn the earliest printed report of the Boston Female Medical\r\nSchool (1851), most stress is laid upon the course of study for\r\n_Midwives_, which is as follows:\r\n\r\n Candidates for Diplomas as Practitioners in Midwifery, must be at\r\n least twenty years of age, and must present testimonials of good moral\r\n character; they must have studied at least one year, including the\r\n Lecture terms; must have attended two full courses of Lectures, one of\r\n which must have been in this institution: and must pass a satisfactory\r\n examination before the Board of Examiners, in Anatomy and Physiology,\r\n in Obstetrics and the diseases peculiar to Women.\r\n\r\n_Nurses_ are referred to in the statement that:\r\n\r\n Courses of Lectures and Instruction will be given to Nurses in\r\n reference to their important and responsible vocation of attending the\r\n sick.\r\n\r\nAnd _Female Physicians_ are considered in the paragraph:\r\n\r\n The candidates for full Medical Diplomas must have pursued a\r\n course of Education equivalent to that required in other medical\r\n institutions; and at least two terms of their instruction must have\r\n been in this School.\r\n\r\nWhile all groups are urged to seek to prepare themselves, “Persons\r\nintending to become members of the School will do well to study, in\r\nadvance, some elementary work on Anatomy and Physiology--Cutter,\r\nJarvis, etc.,” closing with the naïve statement whose wisdom cannot be\r\ngainsaid, “And any other preparatory knowledge will be useful.”\r\n\r\nThus we see that the Boston Female Medical School aimed as high as any\r\nof the male medical schools of the day. Really, its aim was higher,\r\nin that from the beginning it planned to have a Hospital and to make\r\n“practical” instruction in obstetrics and the diseases of women an\r\nintegral part of its course. In advocating this latter procedure, it\r\nclaims superiority for itself, making the statement that “the Harvard\r\nMedical School furnishes no facilities in the way of ‘practice’ in a\r\nMaternity Hospital--the most important part of an obstetric education.”\r\n\r\nBut, presumably, this school found itself practically confined to the\r\neducation of midwives and nurses--groups whose qualifications were\r\napparently not regulated by strict legal enactment. Because, in 1856,\r\nan act of legislature was passed changing the name of the Female\r\nMedical Education Society to that of the _New England Female Medical\r\nCollege_, and giving this latter body power to “appoint Professors,\r\nwho shall constitute a Medical Faculty; and to confer the usual degree\r\nof Doctor of Medicine,” provision for these latter legal necessities\r\nhaving evidently been overlooked in the earlier incorporation of 1850.\r\n\r\nThe New England Female Medical College says nothing in its reports\r\nabout midwives, but speaks only of medical students, of nurses, of\r\nfemale physicians, and of its purpose to have “a part of the Faculty\r\nconsist of female Professors.” But it lists its medical alumnæ from\r\n1854.\r\n\r\nThus becoming acquainted during the summer with the new field for my\r\nactivity, I found still an added difficulty among the few women who\r\npossessed a medical diploma, namely, that not being accustomed to work\r\nwith one another on a common plane, they rather feared any one whose\r\nstandpoint differed from their own and who brought new views of the\r\nsubject in question.\r\n\r\n“What is, or was, sufficient for me ought to be sufficient for all who\r\ncome after me,” was the common human principle on which they based\r\ntheir indifference towards improving or enlarging their stock of\r\nknowledge. Medicine was then taught, even in the best of colleges, not\r\nas a scientific vocation but as a practical business.\r\n\r\nFor instance, after having been connected with the New England Female\r\nMedical College for a year, I ventured to express my surprise that no\r\nmicroscope was in the college, and to say that I wished for one because\r\nmuch that it was necessary to explain could only be done with such an\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nMy petition for one was refused. And Mr. Sewall informed me that one of\r\nthe gentlemen who was a leader in the college, after having listened\r\nto my written petition, said, “That is another one of those new-fangled\r\nEuropean notions which she tries to introduce. It is my opinion that\r\nwe need a doctor in our medical department who knows when a patient\r\nhas fever, or what ails her, without a microscope. We need practical\r\npersons in our American life.” This man is long dead, yet I feel sorry\r\nthat he could not have lived longer in order to see that we teach\r\nthe new-fangled notion of the use of a microscope even in our public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nIt can easily be understood that my position, both as professor\r\nof midwifery and as head of the clinical department, was not very\r\nagreeable, with such opponents among the directors of the school and\r\nhaving to meet the indifference of the established women doctors of\r\nBoston; and also, I am deeply sorry to say, receiving only limited\r\nsupport from the men physicians with whom I was associated in the\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\nAlthough in favor of the school, the students were regarded by these\r\nphysicians more in the light of trained nurses who were to become their\r\nhandmaids in practice. This fact revealed itself to me when, feeling\r\nthe need of consultants, I tried to reorganize the hospital staff. I\r\nfound that none of the prominent Boston physicians was willing to give\r\nme his name, and the excuse was that the standard of the school was\r\nbelow par. On the other hand, the physicians connected with the school\r\nthought they were teaching all that a woman doctor ought to know.\r\n\r\nHere I want to anticipate a little by telling of my first examination\r\nof students for the degree of M.D. This was to be carried on by the\r\nprofessors of the school, in the presence of a committee of three\r\nfrom the directors, but only one of the latter appeared. Several\r\nof the candidates who presented themselves for their examination\r\nwere possessed of such elementary education that they had no other\r\nrecommendation to the examiners than that they had attended two courses\r\nof medical lectures of twenty weeks each, and had studied with a\r\npreceptor to make up three years of reading medicine, but whom I had\r\nnever seen in our clinical department.\r\n\r\nI objected, of course, to these students as unfit for a position of the\r\ngravest responsibility. While all the rest reluctantly took my side,\r\nthey added, “Nobody in Boston would employ a woman doctor in serious\r\ncases, anyhow!” However, I prevailed, and I did not have to place my\r\nname on the diploma of women who, excellent as nurses, were unfit to\r\ntake the position of physicians.\r\n\r\nBy October 1, 1859, I considered myself strong enough to begin regular\r\ndaily work. The housekeeping cares which I had hitherto assumed were\r\ndivided with a competent woman. Financial difficulties, however, were\r\nnot so easily overcome, and we had to charge a board payment of three\r\ndollars a week to such students as wished to avail themselves of\r\nresidence within the building.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement added a good deal of care to me as superintendent,\r\nfor, in spite of exercising the greatest impartiality between the\r\nresident students and those from outside, a feeling naturally grew up\r\namong the students that favoritism was practiced. What really happened\r\nwas that, as a consequence of constant presence, the internes appeared\r\nbetter equipped to render assistance than the externes. A few of these\r\nlatter, however, gave me credit by word and deed that, if anything, I\r\nfavored the externes rather than the internes and these few became real\r\nand true friends in later years, often calling upon me or writing for\r\nadvice, as well as giving me their sincere friendship.\r\n\r\nTo be appreciated as just, conscientious and unselfish has always been\r\nmy ambition--other honors, or wealth, I have never sought nor received.\r\nEven at this moment, when age has come to me and health has failed, my\r\nsmall income from my savings gives me greater satisfaction than if I\r\nhad accumulated a large competency. Though I should still like to have\r\nthis latter in order that I might help many a struggling woman to whom\r\nI have to refuse aid because I am poor myself.\r\n\r\nAmong the resident students, were Lucy E. Sewall, my private pupil\r\nand devoted friend and co-worker during her life; Anita E. Tyng, a\r\nwoman of talent, at present living in California; Mary H. Thompson,\r\nwho became famous by establishing the _Woman’s Hospital_ in\r\nChicago, reëstablishing the same after it was burned during the great\r\nconflagration; Helen Morton, my associate in practice after her return\r\nfrom Paris in 1867, and still residing in Boston; Lucy Abbott, who\r\nbecame resident physician at the New York Infirmary; and others who\r\nbecame of more or less importance in after years.\r\n\r\nAgain our household assumed more of the condition of a family circle\r\nlike that of the New York Infirmary, having a similar intimacy. This\r\nwas due to the fact that, although women physicians were more tolerated\r\nin Boston society, they had not yet conquered all doubt or prejudice\r\namong the women of Boston, while the profession at large would not\r\nrecognize any of them at all.\r\n\r\nHowever, I made the attempt to call upon a few prominent men. For\r\ninstance, I saw Dr. Henry E. Clark, who had visited the Hospital\r\nCharité in Berlin when I held the position of _Accoucheuse en\r\nchef_ in the Maternity Department of that institution. And I had the\r\nopportunity of being very helpful to him in all he wished to gain as a\r\nyoung doctor seeking experience in a foreign land. He received me with\r\nkind politeness, but told me frankly that he could not sanction the\r\nstudy of medicine by women. He yielded so far as to pronounce me “an\r\nexception” to my sex, and he promised to assist me in private practice\r\nshould I require consultation. Also, in the course of the winter, he\r\nsent me several patients, and he spoke with recommendation to those who\r\ninquired of him about me and my former position in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAnother one, Dr. John Ware, accepted me as an exceptional woman, and\r\nfatherly and kind as he was, he laughed heartily when I told him that\r\nthe exceptions would multiply by the hundred.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Ware writes, under date of February 11, 1860:\r\n\r\n My DEAR MADAM:\r\n\r\n I ought before now to have acknowledged your kindness in sending me a\r\n copy of your Lecture. I have read it with much satisfaction, and wish\r\n most heartily that every one of my professional brethren entertained\r\n views as just and elevated of the nature of their calling, and were as\r\n conscientious in regard to its responsibilities as you would have all\r\n be who assume them.\r\n\r\n I take the liberty of sending in return a few publications of my\r\n own, relating in part to the same topic. You will find on the\r\n 24th page of one of the Lectures--that on “Success in the Medical\r\n Profession”--a brief expression of my opinions on the subject of\r\n Female practitioners, which, altho’ you may not agree with them, I\r\n hope you will find no reason otherwise to disapprove.\r\n\r\n I am, with sincere respect and regards,\r\n\r\n  Yrs.\r\n  JOHN WARE\r\n  To Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, referring to the earlier chapters of this autobiography, he\r\nwrites, on December 13, 1860:\r\n\r\n  My dear Miss Zakrzewska:\r\n\r\n I received yesterday a volume which I supposed, certainly I hoped,\r\n came from you. I read it at once, and with the deepest interest. I\r\n have a right, therefore, whether it came from you or not, to thank\r\n you for it. Neither can I let the opportunity escape of expressing\r\n the admiration and sympathy with which I followed you in the long\r\n struggle you endured, and which you maintained with so much of that\r\n energy, courage, perseverance and fortitude, which we are apt to\r\n call manly--as if they were our peculiar possession--and yet without\r\n any infringement of that womanly delicacy, which we certainly cannot\r\n claim.\r\n\r\n You know perhaps my doubts about the medical education of women. It is\r\n not because I do not think well enough of women that I entertain these\r\n doubts, but rather, I suspect because I think too well of them, to be\r\n willing they should go through with a medical education, or endure a\r\n medical practice. I have put it to myself whether I could be willing\r\n that one of my daughters should go through the discipline and lead the\r\n life that I have done myself. The idea is intolerable. That you have\r\n accomplished what you have with success and honor does not satisfy my\r\n doubts--how few of either sex could do the same.\r\n\r\n I may be mistaken, for it is very hard to be sure that we are not\r\n influenced by early impressions and the prejudices of society, and\r\n I am quite willing to find myself in the wrong, for I have the most\r\n earnest desire that every possible avenue should be opened for the\r\n admission of women, not only to places for labour, but of honor and\r\n profit. I sympathize not only with every attempt to enforce “Woman’s\r\n Right to Labour”--but to think, speak, act and enjoy.\r\n\r\n With sincere regard, I am your friend,\r\n\r\n  JOHN WARE\r\n  To Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nDrs. Henry I. Bowditch and Samuel Cabot regretted to refuse all aid so\r\nlong as I was connected with such an inferior school as they considered\r\nthe New England Female Medical College to be.\r\n\r\nDr. Cotting, of Roxbury, was the most cordial; he expressed himself as\r\nfavorable to having women physicians as auxiliaries to the professional\r\nmen. He sent me more patients than any one, and they were rich as\r\nwell as poor. The latter were the most desirable, as our dispensary\r\npractice was small, lacking material for the benefit of the students.\r\n\r\nThis was the great difference between New York and Boston. Within three\r\nmonths after opening the New York Infirmary dispensary, we were obliged\r\nto close the doors for admission after a certain hour, so full became\r\nour reception hall; while in Boston we kept open all the forenoon\r\nwithout getting all the patients we wanted, and we even attended to\r\nthem the whole day.\r\n\r\nThis may have been due to the fact that the college and hospital were\r\nlocated in what was then a demi-fashionable quarter of the city,\r\nthe South End, where not many poor lived; and distance was not then\r\nannihilated by street cars, of which none existed. But it was also\r\ndue to a greater prosperity among the poor of Boston, this creating a\r\nprejudice against free dispensaries in general, and women physicians in\r\nspecial.\r\n\r\nTo all these reasons was due the very hard work which we had to do,\r\nbecause if a family in the distant poor quarters inclined to favor\r\nus with their patronage, we had to rejoice. And the disadvantage of\r\nsuch events because of walks of two or three miles in the midst of\r\nwinter nights was overcome by the enthusiasm of having gained another\r\nfoot-hold among the poorest of the poor. Thus we had our clientele not\r\nonly, though chiefly, at the North End of the city but also in the\r\nsuburbs, where not even omnibus travel was possible, there being none\r\nto South Boston, Dorchester, Roxbury, Jamaica Plain and other outlying\r\ndistricts.\r\n\r\nWhat would life be without the enthusiasm of the young! And how much\r\nor how little would be accomplished in the evolution of reforms and\r\nprogress, if the young were not ready and happy to live up to the\r\nfullest inspiration of this enthusiasm! Reasonable or unreasonable,\r\nlet us not stint or discourage any enthusiastic young person in the\r\nways and means of living up to its fullest extent! Youth will always\r\nmeet with more or less success in realizing its ambition, and even if\r\npremature death should be the consequence of such efforts, it does pay\r\nto have favored and encouraged the activity of such aspirations.\r\n\r\nThe happiness which is enjoyed by enthusiastic workers is impossible\r\nto describe in words, for, though ever so little be gained from the\r\nopposition, or by perseverance, this gain gives moments of joy which\r\ncannot be outweighed by many a disappointment or by any amount of\r\nfatigue. Oh! the single hour of happiness which victory brings! Even\r\nin humble aspirations, it is worth living for. It is not the quantity\r\nof anything which satisfies a noble heart--it is the quality, and the\r\nfeeling of conscious satisfaction that the best of which the person was\r\ncapable has been done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n _Formal opening of the College term--Professor Zakrzewska delivers\r\n the Introductory Lecture--Father disapproves of her removal to\r\n Boston--This increases the shock of news of his death. (Thirty years\r\n of age: 1859.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term of 1859-1860 of the college opened well. A goodly number of\r\nstudents had registered, among them the fine women already mentioned\r\nwho assisted much in giving a high tone to our work, and I felt\r\ngreatly supported by their earnestness and zeal. [According to the\r\ncollege announcement, this term opened on November 21, 1859, with the\r\n“Introductory Lecture by Professor Zakrzewska.” A few extracts from\r\nthis formal address will help still further in developing the portrait\r\nof the speaker.]\r\n\r\n The study of medicine is so great and comprehensive a field that\r\n within its horizon we find included the whole moral world. It\r\n comprises mankind in all its conditions, in all its changes of\r\n opinions and in all its modes of society. It has been subject to the\r\n highest wisdom in existence, to the greatest folly and mysticism which\r\n superstition could produce and, in our days, to the most profound\r\n learning and scientific speculation. And though I am now addressing a\r\n miscellaneous audience of which only a few are physicians or students\r\n of medicine, every one is in some way connected with the profession,\r\n be it only as a patient. Every one receives this liability as an\r\n inheritance from nature and, therefore, ought to be interested in a\r\n science which occupies itself with mankind.\r\n\r\n The only motives that this profession permits to its votaries are\r\n the clear and decided conviction of an inborn taste and talent\r\n for the practice of medicine and an earnest desire for, and love\r\n of, scientific investigations concerning the human being--its\r\n construction, its condition of health and disease, and all its\r\n relations with the surrounding world.\r\n\r\n It is a positive fact, acknowledged among all nations and at all\r\n times, that there is in the mass a growth of the human mind from\r\n generation to generation similar to that in the different periods of\r\n individual existence. And to these varying stages of mental growth\r\n we must ascribe the different forms through which the practice of\r\n medicine has passed.\r\n\r\n Disease is as old as mankind. The first sore finger made the first\r\n patient, and the first physician was the one who bound it up or who\r\n inquired how it was doing. Pain awakens the instinct to relieve, one\r\n following the other, and this must have existed from the creation of\r\n mankind.\r\n\r\n The practice of medicine dates back, therefore, to the morning of\r\n life; the shadows of a hoary antiquity gather around its cradle. The\r\n annals of history do not reach back of it, but only open the portals\r\n of fable in whose shadowy domain it is supposed to dwell. Æsculapius\r\n was the grandson of Zeus, whose father was Time himself.\r\n\r\n Gradually we see it emerging from this hazy atmosphere in the form\r\n of a mysterious science, assisted and appropriated by the mysticism\r\n of the oracles and astrologers, until it found its devotees in the\r\n priesthood who pursued the practice upon the body in connection with\r\n their duties as priests for the soul.\r\n\r\n It is only since medicine has ceased to stand isolated from the other\r\n sciences that the erroneous belief that disease was produced by\r\n supernatural agency has waned. Nothing has more retarded the progress\r\n of medicine in becoming really scientific than its separation from\r\n general learning; and nothing could favor empiricism and superstition\r\n more than the promotion of this separation.\r\n\r\n That this separation produced an apparently inextricable confusion\r\n was very natural, just as it was natural that medical sects should\r\n have been formed of which the one renounced this, the other that, and\r\n the third something else--each individual sect being distinguished\r\n by its one-sidedness. The only sect--if we may thus term the regular\r\n physicians--which at no time could be accused of one-sidedness in\r\n its proclamations was that based upon the principles of Hippocrates\r\n and the Alexandrian School--these advising practical, experimenting\r\n science, a course of reasoning which Lord Bacon in his works has\r\n approved with such justice. And how necessary it was to follow this\r\n recommendation continually and in every particular is best illustrated\r\n by showing how one branch of medical practice could fall almost into\r\n oblivion by neglect to pursue it as an _experimental_ science.\r\n\r\n For instance, in the history of Obstetrics, we find that very little\r\n was done to promote its elevation from the times of Hippocrates and\r\n Celsus until within the last one hundred and twenty years, when\r\n Pareus, Mauriceau, De la Motte, Deventer, and Justina Siegesmundin and\r\n others began to investigate it and to raise it to its proper place as\r\n a science.\r\n\r\n Until this time, the obstetric art was so entirely neglected that\r\n it was considered beneath the dignity of an honorable man. Low and\r\n uneducated persons appropriated this practice to themselves, even in\r\n cases of the greatest emergency. The degradation of this branch alone\r\n proves the need of the introduction of new ideas formed by constant\r\n observation in science at large; it also proves that we cannot abandon\r\n speculations and experiments on the natural laws which pervade all\r\n organizations; and that it is a matter of great necessity that every\r\n student of medicine should be provided with ample opportunities for\r\n so doing. And how successful and beneficent, although difficult, such\r\n reforms are, I shall illustrate by speaking again of the resurrection\r\n of obstetrical science.\r\n\r\n New life had to be introduced into it before new light could be thrown\r\n upon this field; and this new life was finally introduced when the\r\n persons just named entered upon the study. They found that midwifery\r\n as it was then practiced must be reorganized. Observations on nature\r\n needed to be made and these were to be followed by scientific\r\n analysis, and the results introduced into practice.\r\n\r\n A new era for the studious was opened, and many young and brilliant\r\n minds now found their attention directed towards this branch of\r\n learning which before they had considered as a subject beneath their\r\n dignity. Very soon after the first attempt for improvement, an ardent\r\n enthusiasm was created in the subject, since in it a field for new\r\n investigations, and consequently for new honors, became apparent\r\n to the eyes of the ambitious or the learned. In a very short time,\r\n the practice of obstetrics was regulated in such a manner that not\r\n only had the horror towards the persons engaged in it entirely\r\n disappeared, but the terrible operations often practiced had also\r\n become lessened to an insignificant number, these latter belonging to\r\n the class of unavoidables.\r\n\r\n Every country produced authorities. England boasted her John Burns and\r\n Hunter, while France raised up her Baudeloque, her Madame Lachapelle,\r\n Madame Boivin and many others. But no country gave to the profession\r\n such thoroughly scientific investigators as did Germany, and of these\r\n a _woman_ took the lead. Justina Siegesmundin was the pioneer of\r\n this great reform, and her work, written upon the subject in 1741,\r\n came upon Europe like a thunderbolt. In every country, minds which had\r\n been preoccupied with a thousand other things, forgetting the most\r\n important, were awakened to an activity which would but a short time\r\n before have been deemed impossible. In Germany, therefore, the subject\r\n of obstetrics is still considered as of momentous importance, the\r\n foundation almost of all other practice ... and the statistics prove\r\n that in this branch of practice less loss of life occurs there than\r\n in any other country, though its proportion of difficult cases is the\r\n greatest of any.\r\n\r\n Reformations similar to this will be constantly demanded in all the\r\n different branches of medical science.... Every day brings results of\r\n new researches which are throwing fresh light upon subjects not yet\r\n understood.\r\n\r\n And this is the position which a physician must assume to-day, and\r\n for which those who are entering upon this field of study should\r\n fit themselves. To be an honorable acquisition to the profession, a\r\n consoler to those who require assistance in overcoming disease, a\r\n public instructor in the art of preserving health, a reformer from\r\n the artificial to the natural--these are the aspirations which must\r\n animate every one who dares attempt to step forward to the platform of\r\n the benefactors of mankind.\r\n\r\n This is the aim which the beginner must have in her mind, and if she\r\n falls short of attaining it, she must be able to say that it was\r\n neither through indolence nor indifference, but through absolute\r\n powerlessness. If you doubt this to be the position which the student\r\n should take, then look around and ask yourself what you want of your\r\n physician.\r\n\r\n If you are educated, you want your physician to be still more so; if\r\n you possess perception of conditions and circumstances, you demand\r\n this of your physician still more. You want of him that he shall not\r\n only perceive and penetrate into the secret relations and conditions\r\n of the body physically and psychically, but that he shall also explain\r\n to you those phenomena which are incomprehensible to you in spite of\r\n your great perceptive faculties.\r\n\r\n You further demand of your physician that he shall know everything\r\n belonging to medical science. If you understand physiology well,\r\n you demand that your physician shall explain in a moment every fact\r\n that is dark to you, while a lifetime may not be sufficient to prove\r\n a hypothesis. If you are at home in chemistry, you will certainly\r\n be greatly surprised if your physician makes a mistake in some\r\n combinations, and you will be ready to say that he is stupid. If you\r\n have great skill in nursing, you will expect your physician to teach\r\n you how to improve; if you are kind and agreeable and amiable, you\r\n demand the same qualities in him; if you are irritable, fretful and\r\n capricious so that you have been designated by your neighborhood as\r\n a fury, you want at least that your physician should comprehend your\r\n subtle nature. And in addition to all this, your physician must be\r\n sociable, entertaining, wise in every word, overflowing with great\r\n thoughts, and uttering new truths whenever you invite him to your\r\n table.\r\n\r\n All this is really demanded of the physician, but how far it may be\r\n justifiable, I leave it to the thinking ones to decide. But of this\r\n we may be sure--the physician of the present day occupies a higher\r\n station than ever before and greater qualifications for the study of\r\n medicine are increasingly demanded.\r\n\r\n I mentioned in the beginning that the motives for the study of\r\n medicine must be the right ones; now I have to add that these alone\r\n will not suffice to make a good physician such as we want to-day.\r\n These motives must be accompanied by certain qualifications. The\r\n latter are twofold, and may be divided into those belonging to the\r\n intellect, and those belonging to our personal and affectional nature.\r\n\r\n It is of infinite importance that the intellect should have been\r\n previously developed by a course of study which shall train the\r\n student in logic and reasoning and familiarize him with natural as\r\n well as with moral and mental philosophy. Observation and experiment\r\n are the two great auxiliaries to medical study. Those who possess\r\n the first as a natural gift and who have judgment enough to apply it\r\n whenever they have an opportunity will take the lead, but those in\r\n whom both must be developed will always limp behind unless they study\r\n most industriously and perseveringly.\r\n\r\n Foremost among the second group of qualifications stands the matter of\r\n age. The student ought to be mature enough to think and to reason, but\r\n not advanced beyond the time when the mind is naturally predisposed\r\n to acquiring knowledge. Physical health and prepossessing appearance\r\n are of the next importance; while cultivated manners and agreeable\r\n behavior, as well as talent in adapting himself or herself to all\r\n conditions, all circumstances and all persons, are by no means the\r\n last to be considered.\r\n\r\n In addition there are some qualifications yet to be mentioned\r\n which form a part of our affectional nature and without which\r\n no practitioner can succeed. Of these, the most essential is\r\n sympathy--not sentimentalizing sympathy, but the sympathy which never\r\n betrays weakness or timidity and which is firm and persevering,\r\n controlling every action that it may not become rashness. Modesty\r\n and reticence, sobriety and unselfishness are other virtues much\r\n desired in the practitioner. And I add here a word of warning against\r\n temptations into which physicians are constantly led because I know\r\n how often pecuniary gain or social position can be obtained by being\r\n untrue to one’s best self. I have also had occasion to see the\r\n consequences in those who have yielded to the temptation to abandon\r\n their principles.\r\n\r\n No greater misery can perhaps be imagined than contempt for one’s\r\n self; no greater punishment can be endured than the consciousness\r\n of having acted meanly and despicably. A man who when alone in\r\n his chamber is forced to blush for himself carries hell within\r\n him--the loss of a clear conscience is the source of much despair.\r\n Conscientiousness, so important for every man of whatever station\r\n in life, is still more important in a physician. To be scrupulously\r\n honest, to satisfy his own conscience even at the cost of material\r\n profit, is absolutely essential for him.\r\n\r\n It is human life--that most divine element in creation and\r\n irreplaceable when once lost, for which the practitioner is\r\n responsible; and no regrets, no penitence, no despair will be\r\n accepted by those who mourn or will reconcile them to their\r\n bereavement. The loss of a beloved wife and mother perhaps brings\r\n another life to the grave, or it may fix the unhappy fate of a dozen\r\n human beings of whom she was the guardian angel, and who now are left\r\n alone.\r\n\r\n Pause and think for a moment, and try to appreciate the weight of\r\n misery which in lonely hours such a picture reveals to the mind of one\r\n who in a critical moment was made responsible for life and death, and\r\n who must confess that such victims fell a sacrifice to the ambition\r\n which prevented him from owning his inability for the work intrusted\r\n to his hands.\r\n\r\n I must leave the subject here and allow you to decide if I have\r\n pictured clearly enough what we want in a physician of to-day. If I\r\n have succeeded, you will certainly join with me in giving voice to\r\n your convictions that not only the very best method for instruction\r\n should be provided, but that every facility should be offered to\r\n the student to make him or her acquainted with the past history of\r\n medicine. Only those who are familiar with all that occurred before\r\n they stepped on the platform as public instructors or practitioners\r\n will thoroughly comprehend their duty. Great deeds stimulate to\r\n greater ones, and so much has already been done in the profession that\r\n in order to understand his or her own position the newcomer needs to\r\n have knowledge not only of to-day and yesterday but of all times.\r\n\r\n[The foregoing definition of the medical profession paints a picture\r\nfar removed from that of Dr. Johnson, as quoted in one place by the\r\nspeaker--“The profession of physic is a melancholy attendance on\r\nmisery, a mean submission to peevishness and a continued interruption\r\nof pleasure.”]\r\n\r\nThe men professors, of whom there were four, and the other woman\r\nprofessor (teaching physiology) were in apparent harmony with my\r\nplans. These were to devote my teaching--which was threefold, namely,\r\nobstetrics, diseases of women and diseases of children--to only one of\r\nthese subjects at a time instead of giving two lessons a week on each.\r\n\r\nThis seemed to work very well; but as it left only four weeks for\r\ntreating the diseases of children, while obstetrical teaching ran\r\nthrough the winter, the students of less intelligence began to be\r\ndissatisfied and my college troubles had already begun before the\r\nwinter session had ended.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I was not happy in my relations with my father, whose\r\nletters disapproved of my having left New York, where he felt that\r\nI was under the supervision of the Drs. Blackwell with whom all\r\nresponsibilities for the hospital enterprise rested. He now became\r\nreally distressing to me because his conviction was that whether I\r\nsucceeded or not I was disgracing the family, and German womanhood\r\nin general, by accepting a position which caused my name to come\r\nprominently before the public.\r\n\r\nI finally felt that I must write a strong and decided letter to him,\r\nrequesting him either to stop writing to me altogether or else to\r\npreserve silence as to his judgment of me and my actions. This letter\r\narrived in Berlin at a time when he was ill in bed and he died a few\r\ndays later.\r\n\r\nI received the news of his death in November from his wife, he having\r\nmarried again. But I never knew whether he read my letter or not. The\r\nshock was very great and it upset my nerves, not only as the loss of\r\nso near a relative naturally would but also from the fact that I had\r\nwritten a letter which I had for several years hesitated to write, not\r\nwishing to place myself in a hostile position to a father who, after\r\nall, had been kind and had done the best he knew how to do for his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThis news also added another care and responsibility, as my father left\r\ntwo younger sisters unprovided for. Being a salaried civil officer in\r\nthe government, he had no opportunity to accumulate money, and both\r\nthese sisters were above the age when government pensions are allowed\r\nto children. Although my sisters who were married and lived in New\r\nYork and Washington gladly joined in this financial care yet their own\r\nfamily interests could not be sacrificed.\r\n\r\nThus ended the year 1859, and Christmas time was a rather _triste_\r\none, especially as that cheerful festival was not then celebrated in\r\nNew England, and schools and colleges continued in session as usual.\r\n\r\nIn looking back upon it, it seems to me that that year was one of\r\nthe most delightful as well as the most tragic, and one of the most\r\npeaceful yet most conflicting, in emotion, in judgment and in making\r\ndecisions.\r\n\r\nOften have I meditated how differently would we act if we clearly saw\r\nevents a little before they occurred. And how utterly tales of fiction\r\nfail when they describe how rightly instinctive wisdom decides at\r\na moment when emotions and intelligence oppose each other, always\r\nleading the hero to do the right thing. The calm reasoning of the\r\nauthor knows what aim he has in view and what will be the end. In real\r\nlife it is quite a different affair, and no one can judge the result\r\nwhen in a condition of conflict between heart and head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n _As part of her struggle to elevate the College standards,\r\n she insists the students must be trained practically as well as\r\n theoretically--Confirmation of her views by experience of Dr. J.\r\n Marion Sims--Persistence in her convictions and refusal to pass\r\n students whose work is below her standards make many enemies\r\n for her--Private practice increases--She applies for admission\r\n to the Massachusetts Medical Society--Is refused because she\r\n is a woman--Militant ostracism of women by the Philadelphia\r\n County Medical Society--Sketch of the Female Medical College of\r\n Pennsylvania--Appalled by the death rate among babies, Dr. Zakrzewska\r\n establishes a temporary asylum for infants--Continuing unable to\r\n elevate the standards of the College, she decides to resign--Her\r\n resignation is accepted, with the request that she relinquish her\r\n last year’s salary--The occurrence causes a split in the College,\r\n many of the men professors and trustees also resigning--The hospital\r\n is discontinued, and its furniture is bought by friends of Dr.\r\n Zakrzewska. (Thirty-two years of age: 1860-1862.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the Christmastide were prosaic, the New Year’s Day (1860) was not\r\nthe less so. Business went on everywhere just the same, only that every\r\none shouted to each other without any kind of feeling, “Happy New Year!”\r\n\r\nAs the year progressed, lectures and dispensary work, as well as the\r\nhospital department, went on; private practice increased, adding to\r\nmy income, which was small. As professor, I received three hundred\r\ndollars, and as superintendent of the clinical department, an\r\nadditional three hundred dollars. Each of the gentlemen professors also\r\nreceived three hundred dollars while the lady professor of physiology\r\nhad the benefit of an endowment of that chair and received five hundred\r\ndollars. From this it must be admitted that it was not money that\r\ninduced these people to work hard every day, five times weekly, to\r\ninstruct the students, but a real interest in the cause of educating\r\nprofessional women.\r\n\r\nHad the originator of the school (Samuel Gregory), an ambitious man,\r\noriginally a missionary, been a man of higher education and broader\r\nviews, the school might have been taken up by the men standing highest\r\nin the profession. The prevailing sentiment among these men seemed to\r\nbe that if women wanted to become physicians, the trial should be made\r\nby giving them the same advantages as were offered to men students.\r\n\r\nBut in a monograph which had been published by this originator to\r\npromote his plans, under the title of _Man-Midwifery_, he not\r\nonly challenged the prevailing method of practice but abused even the\r\nbest of physicians by intimating the grossest indelicacy, yes, even\r\ncriminality, in their relations with their patients. This was the\r\nreason why no physician in Boston would openly acknowledge me as long\r\nas I remained in connection with the New England Female Medical College.\r\n\r\nBesides this handicap, the non-professional portion of the trustees\r\nexercised a very fatal policy in trying to increase the number of\r\nstudents regardless of their preparatory education, so that there\r\nexisted a great contrast among the students. Some had the best of\r\neducation, while others fell far below a proper standard in their\r\npreparatory studies, to say nothing of the age of some of them. Thus,\r\nwe had a number of students over forty--one was fifty-six years old.\r\n\r\nI admired the courage and persistency of these middle-aged women in\r\nstudying their lessons, often mechanically without understanding\r\ntheir depth, yet I could not conscientiously consider them fit\r\nsubjects to enter upon the practice of a profession which requires so\r\nmuch knowledge in various scientific directions as well as a broad\r\neducation, so as to enable one to comprehend the effects of all kinds\r\nof environment upon the individual patient.\r\n\r\nHow absolutely necessary it is to cultivate in the student not only the\r\nscientist but also the philanthropist, the humanitarian, yes, even the\r\nphilosopher, in order that one shall be fair and just in all situations\r\nwhen consulted by persons morally, mentally or physically afflicted.\r\n\r\nI constantly taught that the treatment of patients cannot be learned\r\nfrom books but must be studied practically. This was a principle which\r\nonly a few of the students would admit. The idea which I emphasized,\r\nthat any other view of treating patients belongs in the realm of\r\nquackery, was considered by these ignorant students as an insult when I\r\ntried to explain it to them.\r\n\r\nBut it must be remembered that at this date such was the prevailing\r\ncustom in even the best medical schools for, as I have already\r\nexplained, students were expected to procure their practical training\r\nat the hands of their private preceptors.\r\n\r\nThat this training was liable to be a will-o’-the-wisp even with male\r\nstudents who had no difficulty in finding preceptors has been well\r\nshown by the personal experiences related by Dr. J. Marion Sims in\r\nhis autobiography called _The Story of My Life_. Nowhere have I\r\nseen the consistent results of such a method of medical education as\r\neverywhere prevailed even at this time, so clearly described as in this\r\nbook which was published in 1884.\r\n\r\nDr. Sims had a preceptor and he was graduated from the Jefferson\r\nMedical College, in Philadelphia, in March, 1835. He states that his\r\npreceptor was a very great surgeon who was often unfitted for his\r\nprofessional work by the habit of drinking. He also states that he was\r\nvery glad when he was able to leave the office of this preceptor and\r\nattend medical lectures.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three weeks after Dr. Sims opened his own office he was\r\ncalled to his first patient, “a baby about eighteen months old who\r\nhad what we would call the summer complaint or chronic diarrhea.” He\r\ncontinues his story, saying, “I examined the child minutely from head\r\nto foot. I looked at its gums and, as I always carried a lancet with me\r\nand had surgical propensities, as soon as I saw some swelling of the\r\ngums I at once took out my lancet and cut the gums down to the teeth\r\n... but when it came to making up a prescription I had no more idea\r\nwhat ailed the child or what to do for it than if I had never studied\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\nTelling the mother to send to his office for medicine, he continues,\r\n“I hurried back to my office and took out one of my seven volumes\r\nof Eberle, which comprised my library ... and turned quickly to\r\nthe subject of Cholera Infantum and read it through, over and over\r\nagain.... I knew no more what to prescribe for the sick babe than if\r\nI had not read it all. But it was my only resource. I had nobody to\r\nconsult but Eberle.... He had a peculiar way of filling his book with\r\nprescriptions, which was a very good thing for a young doctor.... At\r\nthe beginning of his article of twenty or thirty pages there was a\r\nprescription.... So I compounded it as quickly as I knew how and had\r\neverything in readiness for the arrival of Jennie.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his next visit, he continues: “As the medicine had done\r\nno good, it was necessary to change it.” He once more returned to his\r\noffice and “turned to Eberle again and to a new leaf. I gave the baby\r\na prescription from the next chapter. Suffice it to say that I changed\r\nleaves and prescriptions as often as once or twice a day. The baby\r\ncontinued to grow weaker and weaker.” And in a short time it died,\r\nalthough Dr. Sims says, “I never dreamed that it could die!”\r\n\r\nAbout two weeks later, he was called to his second patient, another\r\nbaby which was ailing similarly to the first one. He writes, “I was\r\nnonplussed. I had no authority to consult but Eberle; so I took up\r\nEberle again, and this time I read him backward. I thought I would\r\nreverse the treatment I had instituted with the Mayer baby. So, instead\r\nof beginning at the first of the chapter, I began at the last of the\r\nchapter, and turned backward, and turned the leaves the same way, and\r\nreversed the prescriptions. The baby got no better from the very first.\r\nAnd soon this baby died.”\r\n\r\nDr. Sims was so disheartened, he decided to leave that town, and he did\r\nso. But it is just to him to add that he further wrote, “Being obliged\r\nto continue in the profession that I had started in, I was determined\r\nto make up my deficiency by hard work; and this was not to come from\r\nreading books, but from observation and from diligent attention to the\r\nsick.”\r\n\r\nThus it happened at the New England Female Medical College that,\r\nfeeling as strongly as I did as to the necessity for clinical training,\r\nI made but few friends among my listeners, and I felt out of place\r\nexcept with those few who had had superior educational training. This\r\ndifference in education naturally divided the students, and the feeling\r\nof favoritism grew stronger with the majority, while my interest in\r\nthis majority naturally grew weaker. The clinical department was\r\nfrequented only by the few, as no rule of compulsion demanded of the\r\nstudents a regular attendance.\r\n\r\nMy position became tedious in its teaching duties and unendurable in\r\nits relation to the students, yet I had nothing to complain of which\r\ncould be corrected without changing the whole policy of the school and\r\neliminating the most active directors, in fact, starting a college on\r\ncollege foundations.\r\n\r\nMy male co-workers, men of education and experience, fully agreed with\r\nme and told me that indorsing my election, they had hoped I would\r\nprevail upon the founders to elevate the standard of the school.\r\n\r\nI, a foreigner who, as such, was not greeted with a cordial welcome by\r\ntwo thirds of the directors! And the Know-Nothing spirit prevailing\r\nstrongly during those years in all strata of the community!\r\n\r\nBesides, I did not feel called upon to condemn and to reform the part\r\nof their enterprise which had been justly praised in speech and in\r\nprint, and which had been sustained for years by the efforts of regular\r\nphysicians in the capacity of professors and private preceptors.\r\n\r\nSo, when my first college year closed, in March, 1860, and I flatly\r\nrefused to agree to the bestowal of the degree of M.D. upon several\r\nwomen who presented themselves, I had laid the foundation of a hatred\r\nwhich rendered my work extremely trying and hard, and which to a\r\ncertain extent prevented the growth of our out-door dispensary practice.\r\n\r\nHowever, my private practice steadily increased, and in it I had\r\nthe good will, as well as the assistance when in need, of the most\r\nprominent physicians in Boston. Among these were Drs. S. Cotting,\r\nWalter Channing, H. I. Bowditch, E. H. Clark and S. Cabot.\r\n\r\nThese men advised me to attempt to gain admission into the\r\nMassachusetts Medical Society, of which they were prominent members.\r\nAfter preparing for the necessary examination, I presented my claim but\r\nwas refused because I was a woman, their charter allowing only male\r\ncandidates for the examination.\r\n\r\nThis refusal on the ground of sex decided these men not to break the\r\nrules of the Massachusetts Medical Society by consulting with me or by\r\nassisting me when advising patients to seek my attendance.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, their friendliness had not been withal an admission of\r\nthe principle that women ought to be, or could be, physicians. On the\r\ncontrary, I was informed in private conversation by some of these men\r\nthat I was considered an “exception” to my sex; that such exceptions\r\nhad existed in ancient times and were honored, and that during all the\r\ncenturies such exceptions had continued to occur. Only one famous old\r\nphysician, Dr. James Jackson, told me frankly and politely and in the\r\nkindest manner that it would be impossible for him to recognize as a\r\nlady any woman who was outside “her sphere.”\r\n\r\nA similar ostracism was practiced by the Philadelphia County Medical\r\nSociety against the other medical college for women, the Female Medical\r\nCollege of Pennsylvania, which had been opened in 1850, two years after\r\nthe New England Female Medical College began under the name of the\r\nBoston Female Medical School. But the Philadelphia college had taken\r\nthe precaution from the beginning to obtain the same legal authority as\r\nthe male medical colleges for conferring the medical degree.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it led a precarious existence and had to be closed\r\nfor the session of 1861-1862, and Dr. Ann Preston feared that the\r\ninstitution to which she had given so much time and strength was doomed\r\nto succumb to the weight of opposition and the absolute refusal of the\r\nmale physicians to meet the women physicians in consultation. However,\r\na few of the ablest men disregarded the rules of their society and\r\nstood by the women who had just then succeeded in opening their little\r\nhospital for women and children.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1867 that the Philadelphia College could be considered\r\nas on a firm basis, but within ten years from that time it produced the\r\nfirst woman ovariotomist in America, Dr. Emeline H. Cleveland, who was\r\nresident physician of the Woman’s Hospital after her return from study\r\nin Europe, principally in the Maternité in Paris.\r\n\r\nThus for me the year of 1860 ended. The college course which began in\r\nOctober had not varied in kind from that of the previous year, though I\r\ncould note increased personal success in practice as well as in social\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nThe year of 1861 began for me in no way differently from the first in\r\nBoston. The dispensary practice increased in numbers of patients and\r\nalso in greater variety and interest.\r\n\r\nThere was an especially large increase in the practice among children\r\nand infants, which gave me an insight into the neglect which the latter\r\nhad to endure when boarded out among ignorant, and often indifferent,\r\nfamilies, where the small sum received for the maintenance of these\r\nlittle unfortunate beings was of more consequence than their health and\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which we were required to sign death certificates of\r\ninfants whom we had seen but a day or two before, and who were then in\r\nan almost dying condition, was out of all relation with the number who\r\napplied in the early stages of what was then called “cholera infantum.”\r\n\r\nThis led me to inquire how far the law protected such little beings,\r\nand how far institutions gave relief either to poor mothers by boarding\r\ntheir offspring, or to foundlings. This brought me in contact with one\r\nof the greatest philanthropists to these little creatures, namely, Miss\r\nMatilda Goddard, who had at that time provided good homes for about\r\neight hundred infants, keeping a record as well as an oversight of them\r\nall. No public provision existed save a few places in connection with a\r\nRoman Catholic institution.\r\n\r\nI therefore proposed to a few friends of mine the establishment of a\r\ntemporary asylum for infants, and an apartment for this purpose was\r\nsecured at the corner of Washington and Oak streets. Small as was this\r\nbeginning, we having about eight babies, it drew the attention of a\r\nlarge number of philanthropists to the need of looking after these poor\r\nbeings. And then the Massachusetts Infant Asylum, as well as other\r\nprovisions for these dependents upon the Commonwealth, were called\r\ninto existence. The result was the saving of many a valuable life and\r\nthe directing of the attention of the benevolent to the absolute need\r\nof watchfulness over those helpless beings who are at the mercy of\r\nstrangers during the first days or years of their lives.\r\n\r\nThe work at the college continued to be unsatisfactory to me, and the\r\nyear 1862, which was to become of such great importance to womankind in\r\ngeneral and to me in special, opened in the usual prosaic custom then\r\nprevailing, namely, with every day filled with routine work.\r\n\r\nHowever, I felt very excited, as well as very uncertain how to shape\r\nmy plans and prospects, for I had decided to leave the college and its\r\nlittle hospital at the close of the term in March. I had communicated\r\nmy intention to the directors of the college at the close of the year\r\nof my engagement, in June, 1861.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interested of the directors was Mr. Samuel E. Sewall.\r\nHe asked me what my reasons were for giving up the position, and I\r\nreplied in a letter to him of which I here make a copy:\r\n\r\n About two years have passed since I became connected with the New\r\n England Female Medical College. Twice I have signed the diplomas of\r\n the graduating class, both times with reluctance and under protest.\r\n\r\n My work as teacher in the college and as physician in the medical\r\n department has not been performed with that ease which is the result\r\n of a mutual understanding of all engaged in the same purpose, nor has\r\n it given me satisfaction.\r\n\r\n Not one of my expectations for a thorough medical education for women\r\n has been realized; indeed, I could not even do what has been in my\r\n power heretofore, namely, discountenance as physicians those women who\r\n do not deserve that name. On the contrary, I am obliged by the resolve\r\n of the majority to put my name to diplomas which justify the holders\r\n in presenting themselves to the community as fitted to practice.\r\n\r\n If it were the intention of the trustees to supply the country with\r\n underbred, ill-educated women under the name of physicians in order\r\n to force the regular schools of medicine to open their doors for the\r\n few fitted to study, so as to bring an end to an institution from\r\n which are poured forth indiscriminately “Doctors of Medicine,” I think\r\n the New England Female Medical College is on the right track.\r\n\r\n Allow me to say a few words about the school in justification of this.\r\n To a critical observer, it will soon become apparent that the majority\r\n of the class of students could be made to be only good nurses; whilst\r\n some might become respectable midwives; and a very few, physicians.\r\n Yet we have to give the diploma of “Doctor of Medicine” to all, after\r\n they have passed the legal time in study.\r\n\r\n After the first year of my work here had expired, I hoped to effect a\r\n change by remonstrating in the faculty meeting against the admission\r\n of all sorts of women, old and young, with and without common sense,\r\n and the distribution of diplomas to them all.\r\n\r\n But I found very little support, and I was told that it would be hard\r\n to disappoint some women who had perseveringly labored for a diploma.\r\n According to my ideas, which agree, I know, with the ideas of the\r\n profession generally, perseverance alone does not entitle persons\r\n to receive a diploma. Even should a disappointment prove to be a\r\n deathblow to the student, it is better that one should die rather than\r\n receive permission to kill many.\r\n\r\n It will be perceived by you that these circumstances are not such\r\n as to make success possible, and consequently they cannot make me\r\n contented in my position. I therefore ask you to accept my resignation\r\n as soon as the time expires for which I agreed to remain.\r\n\r\n Knowing well how difficult it is to find a suitable professor for a\r\n college for women, I thought it well to inform you of my intention\r\n a full year in advance. Yet should you find a desirable person to\r\n fill my place before that time, I wish you to remember that I shall\r\n be thankful to be released from duties which are burdensome and\r\n unsatisfactory in result.\r\n\r\n I hope that you will not consider this an impulsive or rash step, and\r\n in order to convince you of the deliberation with which I have made\r\n this decision, and my firm determination not to alter it, I hope that\r\n you will allow me an opportunity to state to you personally, more\r\n fully, my views of the condition of the school under your patronage.\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n  MARIE E. ZAKRZEWSKA\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Sewall gave me this opportunity, especially because as a lawyer\r\nhe wished to explain to me that this letter could not be presented to\r\nthe directors and trustees of the college, as it suggested many points\r\nwhich would necessarily lead to legal investigations and which would\r\ninvolve us all in a notoriety absolutely fatal to the whole cause.\r\n\r\nYet I felt that no malicious intent was in me to injure the school or\r\nany one. I simply expressed my opinion and the opinion of professional\r\nmen outside the college, who would not countenance the school nor\r\nassist me personally so long as my connection with it lasted.\r\n\r\nBut in consequence of Mr. Sewall’s opinion, I resigned at the end of\r\nthe college term without giving any other reason than that I felt not\r\ncontented in my position.\r\n\r\nThis led to many meetings of the trustees as a number of them were\r\nanxious to retain my services, especially as the hospital department\r\ndepended so largely upon my superintendence. On the other hand, a\r\nnumber, under the leadership of the secretary, Samuel Gregory (who had\r\nalready pronounced against such innovations as microscope, thermometer,\r\ntest tubes, etc., as proof of incapacity to recognize the ailments of\r\npatients), tried to convince the others that “foreigners” are not fit\r\nfor American institutions, as they invariably are pedants and too rude\r\nto treat the free American woman with that courtesy to which she is\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nMr. Gregory brought proof of this declaration by calling before the\r\nmeetings several of the women students who were opposed to me because I\r\nhad frankly told them that they might in time become good nurses.\r\n\r\nHe also tried to convince the directors, who were in great financial\r\nstraits, that the school had existed for ten years without such an\r\nexpensive experiment as a hospital department, and that, by my leaving,\r\nthis would be discontinued as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nThus my resignation was finally accepted, with the request that I\r\nrelinquish my last year’s salary of three hundred dollars, as the\r\ntreasury was empty. I therefore became a benefactor to the college for\r\nthat sum, though the treasurer did not acknowledge it in his report.\r\n\r\nBesides this, an agreement was entered into between the college\r\ndirectors and my friends (who now more than ever wished to establish a\r\nhospital for women, managed by women physicians, and for the training\r\nof women as physicians and nurses) that all the furniture and fittings\r\nof the hospital department of the New England Female Medical College\r\nshould become the property of these friends of mine for the sum of one\r\nhundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n[The Annual Reports of the New England Female Medical College during\r\nDr. Zakrzewska’s connection with it, from September, 1860, to\r\nSeptember, 1862, show total expenses for the Clinical Department of\r\n$5,362.97, and total receipts for the same department of $5,024.13,\r\nmaking a total deficit of $338.84. But it must be remembered that Dr.\r\nZakrzewska’s connection with the department ended six months before the\r\ndate of the last report.\r\n\r\nDr. Zakrzewska’s forced “donation” of her salary for her third and last\r\nyear, of three hundred dollars, brought the deficit down to $38.84;\r\nand the receipt of one hundred and fifty dollars from her friends as\r\npurchase price of the furniture left a net profit in the hands of the\r\ncollege of $111.16.\r\n\r\nThe last Annual Report contains not only the interesting omission\r\nof acknowledgment of Dr. Zakrzewska’s donation of her three hundred\r\ndollars salary, but also the interesting acknowledgment of “donations”\r\nof one hundred dollars each from the two men professors who retired\r\nfrom the faculty at the same time.]\r\n\r\nThe whole occurrence brought about a split in the college and the most\r\nintelligent men, among whom was the Hon. S. E. Sewall and some of the\r\nmen professors, also resigned. This was the beginning of the end of the\r\ncollege which, in 1874, was merged into the Boston University Medical\r\nCollege by an act of legislation which preserved to women as full\r\nrights as students as if they were in a college by themselves.\r\n\r\nThus it came about that Boston had a medical school for both sexes,\r\nthough this then became a homeopathic school.\r\n\r\nDr. James R. Chadwick, in an article (“The Study and Practice of\r\nMedicine by Women”), in the _International Review_, October, 1879,\r\nstates that\r\n\r\n “in 1874, while the proposition to transfer the New England Female\r\n Medical College to Harvard University was under consideration by that\r\n corporation, the trustees suddenly merged the college in the School of\r\n Medicine of Boston University, which is under the exclusive control of\r\n homeopaths.”\r\n\r\nAnd he adds the following comment:\r\n\r\n While this act may have involved no betrayal of trust in a legal\r\n sense on the part of the trustees, it certainly was an indefensible\r\n breach of trust toward those who had contributed funds to enable women\r\n to obtain a medical education in accordance with the tenets of the\r\n regular school.\r\n\r\nDuring the three years of my life in Boston, from June, 1859, to 1862,\r\nit was necessary to educate the laity to consider a woman doctor\r\na necessity in family life; to teach it that a woman can have the\r\nendurance and fortitude of body and mind to meet the demands of the\r\nprofession, night or day, winter or summer, rain or shine. Also, to get\r\nthe profession accustomed to the thought that women will study and\r\npractice medicine honorably and systematically. The attainment of these\r\nends was the real satisfaction of these first years.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the eyes of the laity were fully upon us and criticism was\r\nnot wanting. With watchful eagerness to grasp at the least mistake or\r\nfailure, this kind public kept us at the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\n(1862-1902)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n _A third American beginning--Founding of the New England Hospital\r\n for Women and Children--Incorporation for threefold object, to\r\n aid women as physicians, nurses and patients--Dr. Zakrzewska is\r\n resident, attending and dispensary physician, and in charge of the\r\n out-practice--Later, with the aid of paying guests, she is able to\r\n establish her home separate from the Hospital--The charitable policy\r\n of the Hospital. (1862-1863.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quest approaches its goal. But the seeker knew it not, for she\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n In 1862, after disconnecting myself from the New England Female\r\n Medical College in Boston, I stood alone once more, now for the third\r\n time, and still at the beginning of my life’s work, as it appeared to\r\n me. I was no longer needed in New York, yet nothing could I show as\r\n the result of my eight years’ labor.\r\n\r\nStanding there alone as she felt herself, her soul filled only with\r\nthe vision and her movements directed only towards following the\r\ngleam, she was all unknowingly already bound to Boston by constraining\r\nbands, the weaving of which she had shared with Clotho who spins, and\r\nwith Lachesis who allots. And around her was gathering the atmosphere\r\ntowards which her spirit had been yearning, an atmosphere made by\r\nkindred souls who needed her for their life’s satisfaction as she\r\nneeded them for hers.\r\n\r\nMany men and women had upheld the New England Female Medical College\r\nbecause they felt called to assist in the evolution of medicine as a\r\nfield for _human_ endeavor rather than one forbidden to all but\r\nmale workers. When Marie E. Zakrzewska appeared, some of these men and\r\nwomen realized that they had mistaken the light of the torchbearers\r\nfor the chariot radiance, and when she concluded to leave the college\r\nthey decided to go with her and to uphold the determination which she\r\nexpressed when she said:\r\n\r\n“I decided to work again on the old plan, namely, to establish the\r\neducation of female students on sound principles, that is, to educate\r\nthem in hospitals.”\r\n\r\nShe continues:\r\n\r\n Whoever is acquainted with the miraculous progress of medical science\r\n made in Europe, and especially in Germany, will know how far behind\r\n medical education in America had remained. This was chiefly owing\r\n to the want of well-organized hospitals. Clinical training and\r\n practical study can be had only at the bedside and in the deadhouse.\r\n No pathological or physiological discovery can be made in a college,\r\n behind the _cathedra_--it can only be proclaimed from this place.\r\n\r\n Therefore the lecture room for the study of medicine had become\r\n secondary to the hospital all over the continent of Europe, and our\r\n best-educated young men and women were all longing to go to that\r\n Eldorado of medical research and knowledge.\r\n\r\n It was the lack of this method in all medical schools here which\r\n we felt when starting the New York Infirmary, especially as the\r\n few existing hospitals remained--and still remain for the most\r\n part--closed to women students. It was our perception of this true\r\n method for educating a physician that determined us to establish a\r\n hospital prior to a college. We women decided to start from a sound\r\n and correct foundation, and to this principle we owe the great success\r\n so far attained, although it may appear small to those who now enter\r\n upon the work.\r\n\r\n Here let me remark that we willingly allow the newcomers to make their\r\n criticisms of the present conditions; we admit the truth when it is\r\n spoken, but we expect the newcomers to work as hard and to strive as\r\n untiringly and perseveringly as we pioneers have done, to improve and\r\n to complete what has been undertaken.\r\n\r\n A few friends--Mr. George William Bond, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, and Miss\r\n Lucy Goddard--true, firm friends of the education of women, stood\r\n beside me, with no other ready means than some remnants of hospital\r\n furniture, valued at one hundred and fifty dollars, which remained\r\n from our experiment in connection with the New England Female Medical\r\n College. On June 22, 1862, we hired, on our own responsibility, a\r\n sunny, airy house with a large yard, located at No. 60, Pleasant\r\n Street, corner of Porter Street, at a rent of six hundred dollars, and\r\n here we commenced operations.\r\n\r\n And thus was born the _New England Hospital for Women and\r\n Children_, which began its work on July 1, 1862, a few men\r\n physicians being willing to aid us by giving us their names as\r\n consultants.\r\n\r\n Other friends of women’s education soon joined us and became\r\n directors. Among these Samuel E. Sewall, the old friend of the\r\n college, and F. W. G. May, the ever-hopeful treasurer of a then empty\r\n purse, gave us their indefatigable aid and unremitting interest.[8]\r\n\r\n Thus in the midst of the Civil War we started our work. And many a\r\n soldier’s family thanked us for so doing, for just then the darkest\r\n days of the struggle gave us special opportunity to advise and comfort.\r\n\r\nA Provisional Committee managed the new institution. Four of the\r\ncommittee became responsible for the rent, and each of the ladies\r\npledged herself to obtain her proportion of the expenses from month to\r\nmonth. As an example of the faith and courage of these supporters of\r\nDr. Zakrzewska, it is related that Mr. Bond met Mr. Abraham A. Call and\r\ntold him that a house on Pleasant Street had been rented for a hospital\r\nbut there was not a penny to pay the rent, whereupon Mr. Call handed\r\nhim a contribution of five dollars for that purpose and later became a\r\ndirector of the Hospital, his daughter, Dr. Emma L. Call,[21] becoming\r\nin time one of its leading physicians.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Dr. Zakrzewska repeated the superhuman work which she had\r\nalready done at the New York Infirmary and again at the Clinical\r\nDepartment of the New England Female Medical College--organizing\r\nthe details of the Hospital and Dispensary, serving as resident and\r\nattending physician and responding to all calls in both out-patient and\r\nprivate practice.[9]\r\n\r\nThe new institution began at once to grow and on March of the following\r\nyear (1863), it was incorporated, Miss Lucy Goddard and Mrs. Ednah D.\r\nCheney joining her as legal sponsors for the undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe name, the New England Hospital for Women and Children, was chosen\r\nbecause Boston was considered as the center of this cluster of States\r\nwhich seemed to have so generally the sentiments and relations of a\r\nfamily group within the larger Union. But common usage has always been\r\nto shorten the longer, detailed title and to call the institution\r\nsimply the New England Hospital, and by this latter title it has become\r\nknown all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe objects of the Hospital, as stated in the first by-laws, were\r\ndeclared to be three:\r\n\r\n 1. To provide for women medical aid by competent physicians of their\r\n own sex.\r\n\r\n 2. To assist educated women in the practical study of medicine.\r\n\r\n 3. To train nurses for the care of the sick.\r\n\r\nDuring the first transitional year from 1862-1863, Dr. Zakrzewska’s\r\nduties were again increased by the resignation of Dr. Breed as resident\r\nphysician, and this added care continued till September, 1863, when\r\nDr. Lucy E. Sewall returned from study in Europe and became the new\r\nresident physician. As this year progressed the need for an attending\r\nsurgeon was felt and, as there appeared to be no sufficiently qualified\r\nwoman available, Dr. Horatio R. Storer was appointed.\r\n\r\nThis latter is the only instance in which a male physician has been\r\nappointed on the attending staff of the New England Hospital. And this\r\ncutting of the Gordian knot, which was made necessary by the lack of\r\nopportunity for surgical training for women, is characteristic of Dr.\r\nZakrzewska’s attitude of mind. While her greatest interest was directed\r\ntoward developing women she was profoundly interested in all forms of\r\nhuman activity, and she believed a balanced life required everywhere\r\nthe presence of both men and women. The New England Hospital was forced\r\nto be limited to women physicians because all other hospitals denied\r\nthem entrance. Even when they were, later, grudgingly admitted to some\r\nof these latter, it was only to the lower positions, and opportunities\r\nfor advancement were never, and are not to this day, equalized.\r\n\r\nWhen the appointment of a resident physician no longer made it\r\nnecessary for her to live in the Hospital, though retaining her office\r\nthere, she rented a house in Roxbury and once more had the joy of\r\npossessing a home of her own, sharing this with two of her sisters.\r\nThese were the youngest, who had been sent to her after her father’s\r\ndeath, and another whom she was educating for self-support as a teacher.\r\n\r\nHowever, as her financial condition was very precarious, she was\r\nobliged to admit to her household as paying guests some friends and\r\npatients. She thus found herself the head of quite an establishment,\r\nand over this she presided with that executive ability and that\r\natmosphere of elder-sisterliness which we have already seen her\r\nmanifest in her first New York home.\r\n\r\nThe most notable members of this family circle were undoubtedly Miss\r\nJulia A. Sprague, who became her faithful friend and home companion\r\nfor life, and Mr. and Mrs. Karl Heinzen. It is easy to understand how\r\nsuch a personality as that of Karl Heinzen[10] would appeal to her,\r\nespecially as his name had been a household word in her home in Berlin.\r\nShe writes:\r\n\r\n From early childhood I had heard of Karl Heinzen as the pioneer of\r\n republicanism in Germany, whose writings my father read in secret.\r\n He was very poor and he published a paper which was unpopular, as it\r\n advocated not only the abolition of slavery but also “woman’s rights.”\r\n Our friendship was, therefore, based not simply on affinity by nature\r\n but also on principle; and we pledged ourselves to devote our strength\r\n and our means to furthering the realization of our convictions.\r\n\r\nThis friendship lasted as long as Karl Heinzen lived (he died in\r\nNovember, 1880) and its influence on both of these independent thinkers\r\nwas profound and far-reaching.\r\n\r\nIn addition to her other work she increased the Hospital funds by\r\nlecturing to the public; some of her private patients furnished greatly\r\nneeded assistance by holding a Fair in Roxbury; and an especial service\r\nwas rendered by Miss Sprague who gave three months of her time to serve\r\nas matron of the Hospital.\r\n\r\nAn item of interest is the contribution given by the trustees of the\r\nBoston Lying-In Hospital who had at that time no hospital of their own.\r\nDuring the years of 1861 and 1862 this body gave to the New England\r\nFemale Medical College donations of twenty dollars and fifty-one\r\ndollars, respectively, these donations being contributions for the care\r\nof obstetric patients in the Clinical Department under Dr. Zakrzewska’s\r\nmanagement. During this first year of the existence of the New England\r\nHospital (now become the only lying-in hospital in the city) the\r\ndonation was made to this hospital, and it reached the sum of two\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nStriking evidence of the growth of her work and of the faith of her\r\nsupporters is shown in the formation, already in this first year of\r\nthe life of the New England Hospital, of a Building Committee and the\r\nbeginning of a Permanent Fund, the birth of this latter being marked by\r\na donation of three thousand dollars from Mrs. George G. Lee and by one\r\nof one thousand dollars from a friend of Samuel E. Sewall.\r\n\r\nThe charitable policy of the Hospital was one which presented\r\ngreat practical difficulties of administration, difficulties which\r\nhave always fallen to the lot of every one who has attempted any\r\nphilanthropic work. The point of view adopted by Dr. Zakrzewska and\r\nher director associates is admirably shown in the first annual report\r\n(1863) and its appendices. It is especially to be noted here because of\r\nattacks which were later made upon it, as we shall presently see.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n _Extracts from letters to her first Boston student, Dr. Lucy E.\r\n Sewall, now studying in Europe--Lectures to public on “Hospitals:\r\n their history, designs and needs.” (1863.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daughter of Samuel E. Sewall became an enthusiastic admirer of Dr.\r\nZakrzewska during one of the visits which the latter made to Boston in\r\nthe interest of the New York Infirmary, and a close friendship between\r\nthem resulted. An amusing incident of their first meeting has been\r\nrelated in an earlier chapter.\r\n\r\nThis friendship led to Lucy E. Sewall’s decision to study medicine\r\nand she entered the New England Female Medical College as soon as Dr.\r\nZakrzewska became connected with it, in 1859. She remained a student\r\nthere during the entire three years that Dr. Zakrzewska continued on\r\nthe faculty, being assistant student in the Clinical Department, and\r\nbeing graduated in March, 1862. Following the advice of Dr. Zakrzewska,\r\nshe then went to Europe for clinical study and for the practical\r\ntraining which was denied her in her own country.\r\n\r\nFrom the correspondence which ensued many interesting sidelights are\r\nthrown on Dr. Zakrzewska’s personality and activities during these\r\ndays. Thus, she writes:\r\n\r\n  _October 16, 1862._\r\n\r\n  DEAR LUCY:\r\n\r\n I suppose you want long letters and in order to meet this want I will\r\n write as often as I find time, so as to fill the sheet as I go along.\r\n After that forlorn day yesterday, I am established again as usual this\r\n morning at the table writing.\r\n\r\n Now let me tell you that I consider you one of the greatest\r\n intriguants possible. You thought, I suppose, that you could catch\r\n two flies in one beating by providing me with inkstand and pens. Of\r\n course, I have to write if I have the materials; while the things will\r\n not get used up in so doing, and will even be ornamental next year\r\n after you have returned and we have an office together! But wait till\r\n you do come home, and then see whether your speculation turns out as\r\n you calculated.\r\n\r\n I gave the match box and tumbler to Mr. and Mrs. Heinzen who were\r\n greatly pleased with the little memento. Now this is all for one\r\n morning, only let me assure you that you sha’n’t leave me again behind\r\n you; or if you desire to do so, you shall not see me when you start.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _October 21._\r\n\r\n I have had two letters now from Dr. Morton, the one I told you about\r\n and one other, dated September 24, in which she spoke of her safe\r\n arrival and of her terrible homesickness. She calls Paris a cold city.\r\n She likes England very much and wants to hear from you, all about\r\n yourself and your experiences.\r\n\r\n ... Minna writes pleasantly about her life and wants to hear from you,\r\n too. I suppose I will have to send her your letter when you send me\r\n one that I can send about.\r\n\r\n ... Dr. Cabot called here the other day. He was very pleasant and\r\n accepted all as very good--arrangements as well as physicians and\r\n students. I asked him about consultation in forceps cases. He said\r\n it was not necessary to call him for such cases, as forceps when\r\n skillfully applied were without danger to either mother or child. You\r\n see, he rightly supposes we use the forceps “skillfully.”\r\n\r\n The student, Miss Cook, has left for the Philadelphia college. I\r\n really don’t know what else to write to you unless I tell you some of\r\n my domestic affairs, namely, that I got, all in all, eight barrels of\r\n pears and seven of apples; and I have any quantity of tomatoes pickled\r\n and barberry jelly made.... On the 12th of November, we shall have\r\n the Dress Party, which will be given by Miss Nichols in honor of Miss\r\n Sprague’s birthday.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Boston, Pleasant Street,\r\n  Saturday, November 29, at 9 P. M._\r\n\r\n I am in Miss G.’s (the matron of the hospital) room, which is my\r\n present abode during the nights. I have just arrived from the depot\r\n where I left Mrs. ---- (one of her home patients) and Mrs. Heinzen,\r\n who are going to New York. The first goes to see her son who is going\r\n to the war, and the latter accompanies her for safety’s sake. They\r\n both return day after to-morrow.\r\n\r\n Before starting for Roxbury, I read your letter to the whole company\r\n there. They all send love to you and say that it is Holiday when\r\n your letters arrive.... We read all your letters, even those to your\r\n father, and I assure you they are all much too short.\r\n\r\n ... Why don’t you tell me more about Miss B.’s nephew, or have you\r\n decided on a compromise? You remember that I don’t want you to marry a\r\n German, and your uncle forbids an Englishman; so you must try to find\r\n one who combines all the good points of German, English and American.\r\n\r\n ... I was very much amused at your descriptions of the English\r\n doctors. I hope they will be of use to you. What you say about\r\n Dr. ---- and Dr. ---- is, I am afraid, correct, for they have at\r\n times a special faculty for being haughty and making themselves as\r\n disagreeable as anybody can do. I should like to hear more about it\r\n because, from Mrs. ----’s expressions, I inferred the same. I am very\r\n sorry that she has left London. I know her; she spent an evening with\r\n me at the Infirmary and my acquaintance with her was interrupted by\r\n another matter which took my attention.\r\n\r\n ... What kind of a bonnet did you buy? And why did you not complete\r\n the last page of your letter by giving a description of it?\r\n\r\n ... There is no need to tell me not to forget to miss you. I am sure\r\n I never missed any person more than I do you. I almost had it in my\r\n heart to wish that you may not succeed in London and that you then\r\n make a visit to Paris during the rest of the winter, and then go along\r\n the River Seine and come home in June. I feel almost wicked to make\r\n you homesick yet certainly I do feel provoked when you say that you\r\n are not so; for I am homesick for you.\r\n\r\n It is very strange how you have grown yourself into my heart. I never\r\n before have felt such strong attachment for a woman, that is, so\r\n “tenderly” strong. I have always appreciated and loved women more\r\n intellectually. But you are my child. And I am going to have the\r\n first grandbaby all to myself as my well-deserved property.\r\n\r\n You see, I am not so very selfish. I want you to enjoy all happiness\r\n that exists for us poor mortals--which is by no means in the single\r\n life.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Roxbury, Attic Room, Southeast Corner,\r\n  Sunday Night, 10:30._\r\n\r\n I hope this is dated explanatorily enough to need no comments. But\r\n where under this wet heavens are you? We have plenty of water from\r\n above, have you still the same below you? I would almost envy you were\r\n I not so cosily covered.\r\n\r\n Henceforth, I fear we will have to pity you on Sundays in that pious\r\n England. I can appreciate your loneliness, for I often have a taste of\r\n it here on Sabbath evenings. For in spite of all the liberality of our\r\n inmates, we have to be stupid Sunday nights to please them, and I am\r\n always thankful when the day is over.\r\n\r\n Mr. Heinzen said to-day that I am a great talker, and he is not so\r\n very wrong, for it distresses me to see a whole company sitting\r\n together doing nothing, saying nothing, and thinking nothing,\r\n because it is Sunday and they can’t go to church, in order to hear\r\n nothing--but words and phrases.\r\n\r\n I often think I will make these latter myself, using innocent subjects\r\n for the sake of conversation. The presence of people disturbs me and\r\n prevents my thinking deeply, so I talk out what comes along. Have you\r\n ever found me so very talkative--unless I am with people who don’t\r\n interest me very much above a certain degree, say one above zero?\r\n\r\n I hope this letter and the one I wrote to Miss Morton will not be\r\n called belonging to this class. Still, I am writing to-night chiefly\r\n to let out some steam. Some people will not do this and therefore\r\n often burst when least desirable.\r\n\r\n ... My finger which became infected during the treatment of that\r\n little Mrs. ---- is now progressing so that I do not fear future\r\n trouble. It has been the most curious development of pathological\r\n changes that you can imagine. I am sorry that you could not watch\r\n nature in a small trouble and see her action in repairing damages.\r\n\r\n Be careful of yourself for you know that at the time when my finger\r\n became infected, it was apparently perfectly sound, yet there must\r\n have been some point of entrance for the infection which followed. I\r\n am glad that it proved to be so slight.\r\n\r\n I have not been to see your father as I was so very busy, but I shall\r\n go there to-morrow unless the storm continues too severely.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Roxbury, December 28, 1862._\r\n\r\n Merry Christmas and Happy New Year! I shall not tell you any more that\r\n I miss you at any time, for I don’t, not a bit. On the contrary, I am\r\n glad that you are gone.\r\n\r\n I just read this paragraph to our parlor assembly and they wanted to\r\n tear it up. Now, don’t you think that is quite a despotical sign of\r\n our regiment here? I am sure I don’t want to write anything else, for\r\n you shall not get too vain about yourself.\r\n\r\n We, that is, myself and Mrs. ---- and Miss Sprague, as well as Mr. and\r\n Mrs. Heinzen, feel quite proud of our little doctor in England, only\r\n we feel as if that little M.D. should write a little oftener.\r\n\r\n ... Mrs. W---- has a splendid little girl of nine and one-half pounds.\r\n She had a very hard time, thirty-six hours’ labor, and I finally\r\n delivered her with forceps, Miss Tyng officiating as assistant. Mother\r\n and child are doing well and send love to you.\r\n\r\n Christmas was a very pleasant day and evening with us. We had the\r\n parlors trimmed beautifully with laurel and holly, and when I came\r\n home in the evening, I covered the chandeliers with wreaths.\r\n\r\n Then we placed white cloths on the front parlor center table and on\r\n another small one, and set plates on them with German gingerbread and\r\n apples and nuts.\r\n\r\n Returning from supper, we found large baskets and bundles which Santa\r\n Claus had brought to the room and left for me to distribute.\r\n\r\n So after each one had appropriated a plate, I called out the names,\r\n and lots of handsome little things came out of the brown and white\r\n papers, by and by covering the tables completely, so that the room\r\n looked like a charming little fair, and we had ever so much fun, and\r\n many funny things, and I only wish that you had been here, too.\r\n\r\n Now, tell me how you are getting on in London, how your health is, how\r\n much you are learning and how you spent Christmas.\r\n\r\n I have been nonsensically busy, so much so that I am completely worn\r\n out, and to-day I proposed that I go to London to bring you back for\r\n the purpose of getting rested. Everything goes the same old, old way.\r\n Miss ---- is with me but she stays in the same old place and, although\r\n I like her very much, yet there is no mutual sympathy between us.\r\n\r\n Lucy, never marry a man with whom you do not agree on all points! I\r\n feel it more and more, the older I grow, that love grows stronger only\r\n towards those with whom we sympathize; and that we become more and\r\n more a burden to each other if we do not agree well. And although we\r\n may avoid quarreling yet coldness is sometimes harder to bear than an\r\n absolute quarrel. I feel all this with Miss ----, and yet she is far\r\n more agreeable to me than a good many other of my acquaintances. I\r\n really feel an attachment for her, perhaps for the very reason that I\r\n feel we will not be obliged to be always together.\r\n\r\n Miss ---- charged me with a great deal of love for you, and you may\r\n help yourself to as much as you want.... On the 20th, I am giving\r\n a lecture for our Hospital, at Chickering Hall, on the subject of\r\n “Hospitals.” I shall let you know how it comes off.... Write soon and\r\n put yourself into the letter, and I will send you back by the next\r\n mail.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Roxbury, January 25, 1863._\r\n\r\n It is Sunday morning, and I am tired and worn out. I felt miserable\r\n all last week, so miserable that I had to give up my work and my\r\n lessons for the last three days and rest. Yesterday afternoon we all\r\n went to the minstrels, and I am the only one who got used up by it.\r\n\r\n I have had a great deal of practice this winter, more than is good for\r\n me, yet I did not make so much money. People are all poor, everything\r\n being now so dear.\r\n\r\n Nevertheless, I am satisfied with my affairs if I can only keep strong\r\n under the strain. My sister Anna is again quite sick, and Rosalie will\r\n therefore come to live with me in April. Minna had everything arranged\r\n to go to Paris in April or May, but now that gold gets higher every\r\n day, she thinks she must give it up for another year. Would it not be\r\n nice if she could arrive in Paris when you do? I wish gold would come\r\n down again so that could come about.\r\n\r\n Now, a few words as to the talk in England about a medical college for\r\n women. Elizabeth Blackwell wrote to me about this as follows: “She\r\n may get a great deal of valuable knowledge there, but I can judge far\r\n better than she can of the value of their speeches. What they mean by\r\n a ‘college’ is a school for a better class of midwives. To the broad,\r\n true ground of admitting women to an equality in the profession, they\r\n are stubbornly opposed; and they hold the power of exclusion entirely\r\n in their own hands. The law in England makes medicine and surgery a\r\n close corporation, very different from the freedom here.”\r\n\r\n Miss Garrett seems to verify all this, and more. I know, myself,\r\n that the same talk and the same help would be extended to you should\r\n you go to Berlin. But all that means a different thing from native\r\n women taking the same work, as a general thing. There are _some_\r\n liberal men, to be sure, but they are so much in the minority that\r\n their voices cannot even be heard.\r\n\r\n The work for us is in America, and nowhere else. I therefore feel\r\n extremely glad to find that some of the most prominent men in New York\r\n have taken up the matter; they have published a circular asking the\r\n public to give fifty thousand dollars which is to be invested, and the\r\n interest of which is to go for scholarships in one of the great New\r\n York medical schools, for the use of such women as are able to meet\r\n all the demands for a preparatory education.\r\n\r\n This is the best plan after all, both here and abroad, and the best\r\n you can do is to learn all you can so as to come home well prepared to\r\n enter the ranks as a practitioner. Every well-educated woman works\r\n more for the cause of her fellow beings by doing well herself rather\r\n than by meddling and trying constantly to help others. For the next\r\n few years, I shall make this my working principle and after that, I\r\n shall see what is best to be done next.\r\n\r\n ... You are very much mistaken if you think Vienna or Berlin better\r\n than the Paris Maternité for real knowledge. For instance, in Berlin,\r\n no student, not even a male, is permitted to perform “version” or do\r\n anything in the way of an operation. In Paris, every midwife gets her\r\n case of “version.”\r\n\r\n In Vienna, only the male students get “versions.” And both there and\r\n in Berlin the men take the places close to the beds and the women have\r\n to stand on the outskirts; While in Paris no man stands in the woman’s\r\n way.\r\n\r\n ... I felt very sorry that you were so homesick during the holidays. I\r\n really missed you more than I ever missed anybody before. I hope you\r\n will be at home next Christmas.\r\n\r\n ... I sent Miss ---- on Christmas Eve a little ivory bookmark,\r\n beautifully cut, Swiss work; it can be used also as a paper cutter\r\n though it is very weak.\r\n\r\n ... I am not seeing Miss ---- since she came home. I think my\r\n friendship, or rather hers, is over, since she cannot convert me.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Roxbury, February 20, 1863._\r\n\r\n It seems to me an eternity since I wrote to you last, and the cause\r\n of it is that I was very sick and unnaturally busy. I delivered my\r\n lecture on January 20th. and the Hospital got some fifty dollars\r\n profit.\r\n\r\n I had been extraordinarily busy and had the house full of patients in\r\n Roxbury. Besides, I was short of help at the Hospital which worried\r\n me very much. The consequence was that I got really sick, gave up\r\n practice entirely for a week, and when I did not get better, I packed\r\n my bundle and went to New York on a “spree.” Now, is it not curious\r\n that what we wanted to do for so long, namely, to take a journey\r\n together, was realized with Miss ----. She volunteered to take care\r\n of me, and consequently went with me and we had a real good time, at\r\n least as far as I could have it, being really sick and blue.\r\n\r\n Since then I am a little better, but not very well, and so busy that\r\n I have had to disappoint Aunt Hannah three evenings, after I had\r\n appointed the day to take tea with her and to spend a lively hour. Yet\r\n I could not help it.\r\n\r\n So much for myself! Next thing is the Hospital. Dr. Breed has resigned\r\n her position, and I am therefore without a resident physician. Miss\r\n Tyng takes charge in my absence, while Miss Abbott stands second.\r\n She is resident student and also aids in the nursing. Miss Tyng is\r\n splendid in all mechanical work, and together they are very helpful to\r\n me.\r\n\r\n As to a resident physician, I am authorized, and appointed a\r\n committee, to ask “you” whether you will be willing to fill this post\r\n after your return. In case you accept, we shall go on as at present,\r\n and wait for you. Write me, therefore, at once what you think about it.\r\n\r\n My great desire is that we shall have an office together. Now, I\r\n do not like Pleasant Street at all, although it would not make any\r\n difference to you where you begin practice. Perhaps we can find a more\r\n suitable house for next fall. Ours is too small anyhow. However, this\r\n must be left to the future.\r\n\r\n So far, we are doing very well at the Hospital. And yesterday, Dr. H.\r\n R. Storer called upon me and invited me to call upon him, as he is\r\n anxious to extend colleague-ship to me. He was a student of Simpson,\r\n in Edinburgh, and a classmate of Priestley, and he studied with Dr. B.\r\n Brown. By the way, you must get certificates from all these men that\r\n you studied with them, or that you visited their respective hospitals.\r\n If it is nothing more than a simple recommendation, it will help you\r\n amazingly over here, and also do good to the general cause of women\r\n studying abroad. Therefore, try to get something written.\r\n\r\n I shall go to see Dr. Storer next week and show him some of your\r\n letters. I am sure you will find a good reception here, as I am\r\n preparing the way for you somewhat among the physicians. I also read\r\n some extracts from your letters in my lectures, reading especially\r\n loudly the one where Dr. Brown introduced you as “Dr. Sewall from\r\n America.”\r\n\r\n ... I will send you a Philadelphia catalogue next week, but I would\r\n advise you not to encourage any students coming here at present. Dr.\r\n Blackwell is trying very hard to make arrangements for women to enter\r\n the New York University of Medicine. If she succeeds, it would be much\r\n better for any woman to go there rather than to Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[The Female Medical College of Pennsylvania was still struggling for\r\nexistence against the bitter opposition of the men, and especially of\r\nthe Philadelphia Medical Society. It had at this time just reopened\r\nafter being obliged to close for the session of 1861-1862.]\r\n\r\n Rather, let the English women fight their way in England. Don’t get\r\n too much interested in the establishment of a woman’s college in\r\n London. Dr. Blackwell is correct in her statement as to the position\r\n women would occupy there in case they study separately from the men.\r\n\r\n ... I have not yet seen either your father or the books as I can\r\n hardly find time for anything except my practice.\r\n\r\n        *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Roxbury, May 7, 1863._\r\n\r\n ... I received your first letter from Paris on Saturday, May 2d. I am\r\n very glad to hear of your success and hope you will profit by it. We\r\n are going on beautifully here with our Hospital if only we had more\r\n money.\r\n\r\n ... We had five days of incessant storm, and now it pours down like a\r\n deluge. Spring has been very forward this season. Our cherries were in\r\n bloom and we sat on the hill on April 13th. What did you do on your\r\n birthday? We celebrated it by being out of doors all the morning and\r\n wishing for you.... I went to New York again for about four days....\r\n My health is tolerably good again, I think better than last spring....\r\n Miss Sprague is now in Minna’s place, and she heads the Roxbury house\r\n beautifully. I like her very much in this position, she takes such an\r\n interest in the whole affair. Rosalie is with me now and acts quite\r\n nicely as nurse.\r\n\r\n I don’t mean to have many patients this summer; everything is so dear,\r\n and besides it is a great burden. I would rather live by myself and\r\n pay more for the comfort of having a free home than to make a little\r\n profit.\r\n\r\n ... In the Hospital we are so busy that the back parlor is turned into\r\n a ward for four beds.\r\n\r\n ... We have a fine Dispensary now--about one thousand patients this\r\n year and an interesting Hospital. Next week we shall have one great\r\n operation, and probably a second one.\r\n\r\n Don’t be alarmed about my health. I am as well as usual, and I think\r\n a little better than last spring. There are a good many things that\r\n worry and trouble me besides my work, things which I cannot control,\r\n and which have a good deal to do with my running down in health. At\r\n present I feel quiet and happy.... I got a fresh supply of young\r\n chickens this morning.... What buttons did you buy? I want to send you\r\n the money very much.\r\n\r\nElsewhere Dr. Zakrzewska, in speaking of her lecture mentioned in one\r\nof the preceding letters, says that the founding of the New England\r\nHospital had given rise to so many inquiries as to the need for\r\nhospitals that she was requested to give a lecture on the “History,\r\ndesigns and needs of hospitals” in general and of special hospitals in\r\nparticular. She also corrects the figures for receipts, later returns\r\nshowing a net profit of one hundred dollars, although the admission fee\r\nwas only twenty-five cents. She continues:\r\n\r\n It is surprising how at that time hospitals were considered as places\r\n for merely the poor and the wretched, or for the victims of accidents\r\n in public streets or roads.\r\n\r\n We had to cultivate the feeling that such enterprises were something\r\n necessary and desirable, especially since the use of anesthetics and\r\n the great improvement in surgical antisepsis have tended to make the\r\n hospital the regular place for surgical treatment of the rich as well\r\n as of the poor.\r\n\r\n We had also to show the wisdom of isolation by the removal, even from\r\n the houses of the rich, of the patient afflicted with a contagious\r\n disease, in order to save the rest of the family as well as to offer a\r\n greater chance of recovery to the patient.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n _By resignation of the resident physician, Dr. Zakrzewska is\r\n obliged to resume entire charge of Hospital and Dispensary and she\r\n again shows symptoms of overfatigue and strain while awaiting Dr.\r\n Sewall’s return from Europe to fill the vacant position--Illustrations\r\n of the application of Dr. Zakrzewska’s humanitarian instincts and\r\n intellectual convictions to the treatment of her patients, in\r\n addition to technical medical care--“A Lesson”--“Another True Story.”\r\n (1863.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Dr. Sewall accepted the offer of the position of resident physician\r\nat the Hospital, to take effect on her return from Europe in September,\r\nDr. Zakrzewska continued to fill the duties of this position both at\r\nthe Hospital and on the two added days in the Dispensary.\r\n\r\nThe most robust health and endurance have their limits, and she has\r\nalready been noted as giving many symptoms which showed that she\r\nhad been presuming on hers ever since the over-strenuous days of\r\nestablishing the New York Infirmary. Repeated notes of overfatigue and\r\nstrain creep into these letters to Dr. Sewall.\r\n\r\nSpecializing largely, as she did, in that branch of medicine\r\n(obstetrics) which is most regardless of convenience and most\r\ninconsiderate as to sleeping hours, she worked literally day and night.\r\nAnd feeling the whole burden of responding to the demand for the\r\ntrained woman physician which she had so largely helped in awakening,\r\nshe refused no patients.\r\n\r\nHer humanitarian instincts and her admirable ability to enter into the\r\nfeelings of her patients, and to recognize their limitations and their\r\nstruggles, prompted her to send no bills until they were asked for. She\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n If you could see my office day after day full of school-teachers,\r\n dressmakers, mill operatives and domestics, all too proud to go to the\r\n dispensary and yet not rich enough to pay a large fee, you would agree\r\n with me that the prescription for good meat, wine or beer would be a\r\n farce if I took the money with which they ought to buy these instead\r\n of taking the small fee which allows them to keep their self-respect.\r\n\r\nNot content with reducing her fees to a minimum or to zero, she always\r\nadded the constructive work which from her point of view belonged\r\nwithin the province of her profession. This was not done by giving\r\ncharity regarding which she had definite and very modern views. She\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n It is not _Charity_ which we must cultivate and practice: it\r\n is _Justice_ to one another. Charity is what an opiate is to a\r\n patient: it soothes for the time but the same bad consequences result\r\n as follow the drug. We must teach ourselves that the Golden Rule must\r\n be actually practiced in order to reach and raise those who need to be\r\n helped.\r\n\r\nAnd again she emphasizes:\r\n\r\n The Golden Rule must be practiced every day and not merely formulated\r\n as a pious recital on Sunday.\r\n\r\nInvestigating the routine of the patient’s life, she would help her\r\nto reorganize it along the lines of hygiene, of economics, and of a\r\nbalanced perspective; and then would follow a reëducation not only of\r\nthe patient but of the patient’s family and even friends. In this way,\r\nher influence extended to the men of the family and of the community.\r\nAnd these vied with the women in acknowledging their indebtedness to\r\nwhat they called her “common sense.”\r\n\r\nShe depicts this aspect of her work so clearly in a couple of sketches\r\nwritten in later years that they are inserted here to add to the\r\ndefiniteness of the outlines of this phase of her history. The first of\r\nthese (_Souvenir of the New England Hospital Fair_, 1896) is:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A LESSON\r\n\r\n  _I will a round unvarnish’d tale deliver._--SHAKESPEARE.\r\n\r\n Mary was the third child of five in a family in humble circumstances.\r\n The father, an industrious journeyman carpenter, aided by the thrifty\r\n mother, managed to keep all the children in attendance at the free\r\n public schools of Boston until they graduated at the age of about\r\n fifteen years. Soon after leaving school, Mary obtained a situation as\r\n child’s nurse in the house of a rich family, with whom she remained\r\n nine years in the varying capacity of nursemaid, chambermaid and\r\n seamstress. She then married a journeyman plumber twenty-six years\r\n of age, he being thus two years her senior. He had laid by from his\r\n earnings a sum of money about equal to what Mary had saved from her\r\n nine years’ wages, and these combined were amply sufficient to set\r\n them up in respectable housekeeping in a neatly furnished tenement\r\n having a kitchen, dining-room, living room and chamber, also a\r\n storeroom and bathroom.\r\n\r\n In due time, the baby made its appearance and found awaiting it a\r\n handsome cradle, and a wardrobe not only comfortable but pretty and\r\n plentiful. The young father with no small pride carried his son and\r\n heir, arrayed in a white cashmere cloak and suitable belongings,\r\n while by his side walked his prettily dressed wife, when on Sunday\r\n afternoons they went to visit friends and relatives. Thus far, all was\r\n well.\r\n\r\n After the lapse of five years and a half, four little ones formed the\r\n pride and the care of these young folks; and it was just seven years\r\n from the time of their marriage that I first entered their home as\r\n visiting doctor from the dispensary, the indigent being attended at\r\n their homes when illness prevented their coming to the free dispensary\r\n at the clinic hours.\r\n\r\n I found the family of six living in two rooms heated by the kitchen\r\n stove. The children were ill with scarlatina. All around was\r\n the evidence of poverty, although not destitution nor degrading\r\n squalor. By observation and subsequent inquiry, I soon learned the\r\n cause of this changed condition. It was simply this--Mary, who\r\n had gradually adapted herself with grace and intelligence to the\r\n comforts of the rich house in which she had lived from her fifteenth\r\n to her twenty-fourth year, could not now conform herself to the\r\n smaller means and ways of living of a wife and mother in moderate\r\n circumstances.\r\n\r\n She had learned to cook delicate, expensive viands, had a sure belief\r\n that tenderloin is the only steak fit for eating, and had great\r\n skill in the pretty and dainty ornamentation of the babies. These\r\n tastes which she acquired in the rich merchant’s family could not be\r\n gratified with the workman’s means; she had unlearned the thrifty\r\n habits among which she had lived as a schoolgirl in her parents’ home\r\n and she became confused in her methods of work, while the steady\r\n increase in her family reduced her in strength and added to her cares\r\n and labors, a condition not inclined to promote the good temper of the\r\n naturally amiable woman.\r\n\r\n Ofter now, the husband, returning home from his work, found no table\r\n laid for dinner, and still oftener must he start out early in the\r\n morning to find a breakfast in a neighboring eating house, which is\r\n always the first step towards finding rest and companionship in the\r\n saloon.\r\n\r\n This was the condition as it unfolded itself to me during my brief\r\n attendance. The children recovered, and with the aid of cod-liver oil\r\n and tonics provided by the charity of the dispensary, soon regained\r\n full health.\r\n\r\n A little more than a year passed when one day in October, 1876, Mary\r\n presented herself in my private consulting room. She looked haggard\r\n and pale, was poorly clad and in a desperate frame of mind. Her\r\n husband had gone from bad to worse. He paid the rent for two shabby\r\n small rooms in an old house and provided weekly the coal for the\r\n kitchen stove. All the rest of his earnings he spent for his own\r\n meals. Often, if he came home at all at night, it was in a state of\r\n partial intoxication. Naturally, no firm dared give him regular\r\n employment and he supported himself by odd jobs.\r\n\r\n The poor woman had resorted to needlework for support, this being the\r\n only means for her to earn money and look after her children, whom she\r\n could not send to school for lack of shoes and decent clothing.\r\n\r\n It was Friday afternoon. She had just carried her work to her employer\r\n and received her pay of one dollar and sixty cents. She laid it on the\r\n table before me and said, “This is all I with my four children shall\r\n have to buy food with until next Friday--it is not enough to buy even\r\n bread and tea and that is all we have lived upon for the last three\r\n weeks.” She looked wan and hungry and cried bitterly. I sent for a\r\n little luncheon, and while she ate it, I devised the following plan:\r\n\r\n “Mrs. S----,” said I, “take this money and spend it as follows:\r\n\r\n  Buy 7 lbs. corned beef  $0.35\r\n     21  ”   potatoes       .25\r\n     14  ”   cabbage        .28\r\n      7  ”   Indian meal    .21\r\n      1 qt. molasses        .15\r\n      7 loaves bread        .35\r\n     Salt                   .01\r\n                          -----\r\n                          $1.60\r\n\r\n “Boil the meat in twelve quarts of water until very tender. Divide the\r\n meat and broth in seven parts, also the potatoes and cabbage. Cook\r\n one portion of cabbage and potatoes each day in the portion of broth.\r\n Divide this stew into five equal parts for you and your four children.\r\n Do the same with the Indian meal, cooking one part every morning.\r\n Salt it well, and pour on it one-seventh part of the molasses--that is\r\n for your breakfasts. Use one loaf of bread each day for supper. Come\r\n again next Friday and let me know the result.”\r\n\r\n She promised to follow this written prescription, and did so. The\r\n ensuing Friday she again presented herself before me, looking less\r\n distressed having earned $1.70. She said she “was glad to have done\r\n so, as the children could eat more than the seventh part of the\r\n purchase, and it was hard for her to eat it herself and deny the\r\n children.” However, she had obeyed and was able to do more work\r\n having earned ten cents more that week, although she and the children\r\n “felt sorely the lack of tea.” I advised her to make a change in her\r\n purchases, spending the same amount of money for a fresh shin of beef\r\n and turnips or a salted shoulder of pork, and to use the ten cents for\r\n extra molasses.\r\n\r\n After two weeks, she came again to report to me. The change in her\r\n appearance was remarkable, and her account of her children’s condition\r\n was good. Also, she had been able to earn two dollars per week, which,\r\n however, was the utmost she could do in the time she could spare from\r\n the family work. At the end of another two weeks she came to me and\r\n asked permission to give to her husband a share of the dinner on the\r\n coming Sunday. He had smelled the stew when occasionally coming home\r\n and desired to partake of it. It was therefore agreed that he should\r\n add fifteen cents as his share for the cost of the dinner, which he\r\n did, and when Christmas came, she told me had done so regularly every\r\n day for the previous three weeks.\r\n\r\n I made them a Christmas present of a piece of roasting beef, fifty\r\n pounds weight of apples, and the same amount of potatoes, while\r\n former friends to whom I had spoken of their destitution, sent tea,\r\n sugar and milk, also shoes and stockings for the children.\r\n\r\n After this sumptuous holiday feast, severely cold weather followed.\r\n Careless housekeepers in all ranks of life allowed their water pipes\r\n to burst, and great was the demand for plumbers’ work, especially in\r\n the suburbs of Boston. Mary’s former friends were willing to employ\r\n her husband again, under his promise of strict sobriety, as they would\r\n not risk the danger of house-burning by the carelessness of a tipsy\r\n plumber. Mary cooked him substantial dinners of the description given\r\n above, and he felt like a man again in his home.\r\n\r\n Being skillful as a workman and very obliging in disposition, he\r\n gained friends while jobbing in the different houses. Those who had\r\n known him before encouraged him to persevere and finally persuaded him\r\n to remove to one of those suburban towns where his business would be\r\n in good demand and where he would escape from the temptation of eating\r\n house and drinking saloon. Meantime, Mary had learned good lessons\r\n during these sixteen weeks. She now knew how to provide and cook good,\r\n cheap and wholesome meals, and soon adapted herself entirely to such\r\n ways and means as his earnings would provide.\r\n\r\n It is now 1896, and the twenty years are completed since the beginning\r\n of that time of misery in that family, who now own three houses, in\r\n one of which Mary’s husband carries on a fine, thriving business, over\r\n the entrance door of which may be read the sign “John Smith & Son.”\r\n Another house is occupied by them as a dwelling, and the third, an\r\n investment of their earnings, is rented to their daughter’s husband\r\n who is foreman in their business.\r\n\r\n Their life is simple and plain but comfortable, and when I met Mary\r\n recently, she told me that she had taught all the children, two boys\r\n and two girls, how to cook and how to mend clothes, and with great\r\n pride she assured me that corned beef and cabbage is their favorite\r\n dish, “although the children will often make ice cream for Sunday\r\n dessert.”\r\n\r\nThe second sketch alluded to (_The Woman’s Journal_, May 13, 1893)\r\nis:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANOTHER TRUE STORY\r\n\r\n Some years ago, the wife of a farmer living not many miles from Boston\r\n came to my office to consult me, because she feared she was suffering\r\n from a disease such as can only befall a woman and which she fully\r\n believed was “killing her by inches.” With sunken cheeks, dull eyes,\r\n sallow complexion, pale lips and no more flesh on her limbs than was\r\n necessary to make locomotion possible, the woman sat there and told\r\n of her ailments--sleeplessness, utter lack of appetite, backache,\r\n depression of spirits, etc.\r\n\r\n After listening and taking notes of her story of misery, I made a\r\n careful examination and then told her that she was entirely free from\r\n all disease, but that she was simply worn out and needed six months of\r\n rest and good living.\r\n\r\n She sighed deeply and said it was impossible to follow such a\r\n prescription as their pecuniary means would not permit it. She said\r\n further that their two children had outgrown the district school\r\n of the town, and she had, with true Yankee ambition, persuaded her\r\n husband to send them to a relative in the city that they might have\r\n the advantage of came, she told me he had done so regularly every\r\n extra dollar of their earnings, although from motives of economy, the\r\n children spent Saturday and Sunday at home.\r\n\r\n She said she felt sure a tonic would restore her appetite, and that\r\n the relief to her mind in knowing that she was free from disease would\r\n aid in curing her. So, carrying in her hand the valuable recipe for a\r\n tonic which might or might not be of use, she left me, promising to\r\n report herself in ten days.\r\n\r\n At the end of that time she appeared, looking more dejected and\r\n forlorn than at her first visit, so much so that I was startled, and\r\n thought that I had made a mistake in my diagnosis as well as in my\r\n prognosis. With sobs, she informed me that a great misfortune had\r\n befallen them. This statement at once explained to me her appearance.\r\n\r\n It was at the time when the first Jersey cows were imported into this\r\n country from England, and they were held at a great price. She told\r\n me that her husband, about six months before, had invested all the\r\n money they had in the savings bank in the purchase of one of those\r\n valuable creatures. On the day following the woman’s visit to me,\r\n this precious cow had begun to be ailing. The trouble increasing, a\r\n veterinary surgeon had been consulted, and he told them if they would\r\n save the health and life of the cow, they must procure a faithful,\r\n intelligent man to take charge of her from morning to night. This sad\r\n event made it necessary for them to take for attendance on the cow the\r\n services of their best hired man, while the hiring of another man in\r\n his place would prevent their expending money for the charwoman who\r\n gave the good farmer’s wife an occasional lift with the housework. She\r\n sobbingly ended her story by saying, “I must work even harder than a\r\n week ago--you must give me a stronger tonic.”\r\n\r\n The case looked so sad and hopeless that I sat silently thinking for\r\n a moment, when suddenly a bright thought sprang into my mind, and I\r\n said, “Why don’t _you_ nurse that cow and let the charwoman do\r\n your work in house, kitchen and dairy?”\r\n\r\n As when a sunbeam bursts through heavy black clouds, so did a light\r\n flash over her face and into her eyes as I said these words; but in\r\n a moment it darkened down again as she began to think of all the\r\n objections to such a plan. But the idea was born; it grew; and with my\r\n vivid power of imagination, I overthrew all her objections one after\r\n another, until her conversation became really animated, and the plan\r\n appeared so plausible to both of us that the good woman went out of\r\n the office with no stronger tonic than hope and courage can bestow.\r\n\r\n The whole affair was forgotten by me in the pressure of business\r\n and in listening to more stories of moral and physical misery. The\r\n summer with all its joy and beauty slipped away, and brilliant October\r\n brought a new flood of professional business and cares.\r\n\r\n On one of these autumn days, a plump, sunburnt, cheerful-faced woman\r\n entered my sanctum, holding in one hand a huge bouquet of gorgeous\r\n dahlias, in the other a little jar of cream, and on her arm hung a\r\n small basket with a dozen fresh eggs.\r\n\r\n “Don’t you remember me?” she said. Of course I did not, although the\r\n voice was familiar.\r\n\r\n “Well, I am Mrs. F----, whom you advised to nurse her cow.”\r\n\r\n I could hardly believe my eyes, even after her repeated assurances\r\n of her identity with that miserable wreck of the May before. She gave\r\n me an animated description of what followed her leaving my office;\r\n of all her doubts and misgivings during her journey home as to what\r\n her husband would say to such a proposition for both a sick wife and\r\n a sick cow; and of how she had timidly introduced the subject to him\r\n by telling him that I was a queer doctor who did not believe much in\r\n medicine.\r\n\r\n All this prepared him for the account of my plan to which contrary to\r\n his usual habit when women proposed anything, he listened gravely, and\r\n then said thoughtfully, “Well, my dear, we might try it.” She at once\r\n called in the charwoman who had supplied her place that day and made\r\n arrangements with her to come daily.\r\n\r\n The next morning she went to the field, with her rubber waterproof,\r\n her husband and the cow. The latter was tied to a stake, and my\r\n patient seated herself near on the waterproof (as I had suggested\r\n to her) while she watched the cow and petted and talked to her. The\r\n two took kindly to each other. One day’s experiment proved that she\r\n could keep the cow in such subjection and quietness as the surgeon had\r\n ordered, plucking the fresh grass for her and feeding her as needed.\r\n All went well. Let me give a part of her story in her own words:\r\n\r\n “My husband was satisfied with the first day’s result, and made the\r\n few arrangements necessary. And you, Doctor, ought to have seen me as\r\n at sunrise, day after day, rain or shine, I walked to the pasture,\r\n with a big basket on my right arm full of my mending work; in my right\r\n hand a large white umbrella which my husband had bought for me; and in\r\n my left hand the rope to which my bossy was tied, and which, by the\r\n way, I did not need after a fortnight, she following me at my call\r\n and lying close beside me when not walking a few steps for a bite of\r\n the rich grass.\r\n\r\n “My charwoman brought me all my meals and a pail of water for bossy.\r\n I soon had a keen appetite, almost impossible to satisfy; even the\r\n abundant provisions brought me and eagerly eaten with such good relish\r\n still seemed to leave a hollow unfilled; and after my walk home at\r\n sundown, I slept sweetly as I had not done for months.\r\n\r\n “The cow got well; she is now followed by a strong, beautiful heifer\r\n six weeks old for which my husband has already had an offer of just\r\n half the money that he paid for the cow. And I--I feel strong, well\r\n and happy, can do all my work, and have taken none of the tonic.\r\n Besides all this, both my children are equally well, because when they\r\n came home for their weekly sojourn, they felt that they must spend\r\n Saturday and Sunday out in the field with poor mother who had no other\r\n diversion than the company of a cow. I really believe that their being\r\n with me out of doors has done them more good than they would have got\r\n from the change we had planned for vacation, a visit to relatives up\r\n in the mountains.\r\n\r\n “So I thought I had better come and tell you of all the good you have\r\n done to our whole family by your excellent advice, although it seemed\r\n so queer to us all and, you may well believe, to our neighbors too.”\r\n\r\n “How many months did you do this?” I asked. “Was it not tedious to be\r\n all day in such dull company?”\r\n\r\n “I did this same thing,” she replied, “every day, from the time that\r\n I left you until the calf was three days old. And as for tediousness\r\n or loneliness, I never felt it, for I have done a heap of sewing,\r\n old and new, which had been accumulating during the past year when I\r\n could not sew because I was so miserable. Besides, I always took some\r\n reading matter with me, especially on rainy days when I could not\r\n use my needle. And as my bossy liked to have me talk to her, I read\r\n aloud the Boston _Journal_ and our town paper. These she seemed\r\n to enjoy as much as my chatting with her, even when it came to the\r\n obituaries, death notices and quack medicine advertisements.”\r\n\r\n She assured me that she had not had a single cold, although she had\r\n several times been drenched by thunder showers that had overtaken her\r\n when she was unprotected. She said also that she had learned the great\r\n lesson of the folly of carrying self-neglect and self-sacrifice to\r\n such an extent as to bring trouble not only on one’s self but also on\r\n all the family.\r\n\r\n If this little tale should be read by the family described, I wish one\r\n of them would send name and address (which I have no right to betray)\r\n to the _Woman’s Journal_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n _Question of escort in night practice--Expansion of Hospital\r\n by purchase of four houses on Warren (Warrenton) and Pleasant\r\n streets--Professional recognition slowly growing--She buys a horse\r\n and buggy--For first time in America the name of a woman is listed\r\n officially as specializing in surgery, Dr. Anita E.

Storer),\r\n the latter the only man ever appointed on the attending staff--Dr.\r\n Cabot continues to act unofficially. (1863-1866.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nBoston had already extended itself in all directions into suburbs\r\nwhich still kept their dependence upon the center, but the means\r\nof communication remained primitive, as already described in the\r\nout-patient work which Dr. Zakrzewska established at the New England\r\nFemale Medical College. And the isolation was most complete at night,\r\nthe hour when the cry of suffering humanity rings most insistent.\r\n\r\nSo the Doctor was obliged to walk long distances to answer the calls\r\nof those patients who could not afford to send a carriage for her. Her\r\nfamiliar itinerary was from Roxbury to South Boston, to Dorchester, to\r\nWest Roxbury, to Brookline, to Cambridge, and so around the circle.\r\nTemperatures of all degrees from below zero to up in the nineties were\r\nnever allowed to discourage her.\r\n\r\nAs in New York, she was unmolested in her travels. But she never took\r\nunnecessary risks. She always went with the messenger who called her,\r\nand who was generally a man. She writes:\r\n\r\n If he could not accompany me on my return home in the night, and no\r\n accommodation for me was possible in the little apartment, I walked\r\n with the policeman, and waited at the end of the different beats for\r\n the next one to take me to his limits. I was well known among them,\r\n and was not at all surprised when a Franklin Park policeman recently\r\n accosted me as a friend well remembered in the night walks of former\r\n years.\r\n\r\nThe second year (1863-1864) of the existence of the New England\r\nHospital, and of this phase of Dr. Zakrzewska’s life, was marked\r\nby such increased growth of the institution that it was decided to\r\npurchase the former residence of Rev. Charles F. Barnard, No. 14 Warren\r\nStreet (later Warrenton Street), to add to it three small dwelling\r\nhouses in its rear (Nos. 13, 15, 17 Pleasant Street), and to connect\r\nthem by a covered passage. The large house was described as “well built\r\nand convenient, airy and sunny, with a pleasant outlook on the Chapel\r\nyard and greenhouse” (p. 331). It seemed prudent to continue to lease\r\ntwo of the Pleasant Street houses to tenants but even so the increase\r\nin accommodations was marked.\r\n\r\n The result of this expansion [says Dr. Zakrzewska] was enabling us not\r\n only to enlarge our work, but also to divide it into three distinct\r\n departments--Hospital for medical and surgical cases; Lying-in\r\n Department and Dispensary.\r\n\r\n Had our work not been wanted [she continues], had our help not been\r\n needed, here and throughout the country, we should not have found so\r\n many patients asking for help and advice; nor have had so long a list\r\n of names of students waiting for a vacancy; nor have met with that\r\n response from the community which provided the means for carrying on\r\n our institution and enabling us to enlarge it.\r\n\r\nProfessional recognition was slowly growing, but even slight advances\r\nhelped to lighten the almost overpowering mental strain of isolation.\r\nIn such conditions, every slight word or act of indorsement, even\r\nthough with reservations, was like a ray of hope that at last the dawn\r\nwas breaking.\r\n\r\nReferring to this period of professional loneliness, Dr. Zakrzewska\r\nwrites in a letter to the editor in 1900:\r\n\r\n In looking over these reports, there come back to me the many hours of\r\n fear and anxiety when I really was the only person who stood before\r\n the world responsible for our work in the Hospital.\r\n\r\n The few brave men who supported my efforts were advanced in years and\r\n had a large practice; they were often not available for consultation\r\n when requested to come, or they came too late, when the danger was\r\n over or had ended in death.\r\n\r\n My co-workers were young and inexperienced, looking up to me for\r\n wisdom and instruction, while the public in general watched with\r\n scrupulous zeal in order to stand ready for condemnation; this zeal\r\n being stimulated by the profession at large who wanted to find\r\n fault but did not dare to do so openly so long as the two or three\r\n professional men stood as a moral force behind me.\r\n\r\n I remember how twice--once in New York and once in Boston--a man\r\n colleague told me I was foolish to take to heart the death of a\r\n patient which I saw coming as a natural event. Such consolations\r\n helped to uphold me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE NEW ENGLAND HOSPITAL FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\n This hospital was first housed in a dwelling house on Pleasant Street\r\n further along than the rear houses here seen (1862-1864). This was\r\n soon outgrown in favor of the one front and three rear houses here\r\n shown or indicated (1864-1872).]\r\n\r\nThis professional loneliness must have been peculiarly poignant to her,\r\nsince it contrasted so painfully with her recollections of the cordial\r\nfellowship which she had enjoyed with Dr. Schmidt and other leading\r\nmedical men in Berlin.\r\n\r\nAn appeal issued by the directors in June, 1864, asking for funds for\r\nthe purchase of the new buildings, contains a letter by Dr. Horatio R.\r\nStorer giving cogent reasons for the desirability of a special hospital\r\nfor women and noting the particular conditions which made the New\r\nEngland Hospital peculiarly suitable for such purpose. This appeal was\r\nsigned also by Drs. Walter Channing, C. G. Putnam, Henry I. Bowditch,\r\nand S. Cabot.\r\n\r\nAnd about this time, Dr. Walter Channing writes to Dr. Zakrzewska:\r\n\r\n I regret I had not made my visit later as I was too early to have the\r\n pleasure of seeing you. I was desirous to do so to express to you\r\n my entire satisfaction in regard to the operation you performed the\r\n evening before. It was a very difficult operation and was done under\r\n circumstances most unpromising of success. I do not think it could\r\n have been done better.\r\n\r\n I write also to say that if at any time I can do anything to aid you\r\n in the performance of your important duties, I shall be always ready\r\n and happy to do so.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully & truly yrs.,\r\n  WALTER CHANNING.\r\n\r\n  _Boston, 39 Mt. Vernon Street,\r\n  June 2, 1864._\r\n\r\n\r\nRemembering the financial difficulties of both Dr. Zakrzewska herself\r\nand this young, struggling enterprise of hers, one may well wonder at\r\nthe second annual report (1863-1864) stating:\r\n\r\n Half of our beds are always filled by patients who pay nothing, and\r\n the resident physician has the right to receive at half price those\r\n whose circumstances require this indulgence.\r\n\r\nAnd realizing how the prices of the necessities of life must have\r\nadvanced with the continuance of the Civil War, one is not surprised to\r\nread elsewhere:\r\n\r\n We have been reluctantly forced to double our price of board, placing\r\n it at eight dollars per week.\r\n\r\nThe third year (1864-1865) of Dr. Zakrzewska’s new life of freedom,\r\nof the longed-for opportunity for expressing her ideals, and of the\r\nattaining of sympathy and support for the forms of such expression,\r\nfound the Hospital continuing its growth, like a manifestation\r\nincarnate of her soaring spirit.\r\n\r\nThis growth compelled the addition, with alterations, of the remaining\r\ntwo houses on Pleasant Street; and the housewarming which dedicated\r\nthis further enlargement of its opportunities netted a precious six\r\nhundred dollars.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of Massachusetts now voted the Hospital five thousand\r\ndollars for the purchase of the new site, on condition that a similar\r\namount should be raised by subscription. And the Boston Lying-in\r\nHospital Corporation increased its donation to one thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nFor the first time Dr. Zakrzewska, as attending physician, presented\r\nto the board of directors a formal report which she thus introduces:\r\n\r\n Before this year I had never considered that a lengthy report given\r\n by me was a necessity. Hitherto our Hospital had been so small and\r\n so simple in its management that it was easily understood by the\r\n directors and friends.\r\n\r\n This is now changed: for after four years of exertion the Hospital\r\n has assumed from a simple ward the form of a complicated institution,\r\n with its resident and assistant physicians, its consulting, attending\r\n and assistant surgeons, and its attending and consulting physicians.\r\n Such an institution must necessarily attract the attention of the\r\n community; therefore inquiries are constantly being made as to how\r\n this institution is carried on. Nothing can answer all these different\r\n inquiries better than a minute report.\r\n\r\n The most striking feature in its character is that it is designed to\r\n give to educated medical women an equal chance with their professional\r\n brethren to prove their capacity as hospital physicians, and to admit\r\n only female students to its wards--all other hospitals closing their\r\n doors to women as physicians and students.\r\n\r\n The increase in the number of patients seeking daily advice soon gave\r\n a reputation to the institution, and the liberally inclined part of\r\n the community as well as of the profession began to look upon it as a\r\n test of female capability in professional life.\r\n\r\nIn this report Dr. Zakrzewska notes that the increase in the number\r\nof patients had become so great that Dr. Storer offered to share the\r\ndispensary work with her and Dr. Sewall, taking two mornings a week\r\nand making an even division of the time.\r\n\r\nReferring to the raising of the question as to whether it is not an\r\ninconsistency to have a gentleman in attendance, as it has always\r\nbeen stated that the advantage of our Dispensary is that women can be\r\nattended by physicians of their own sex, she continues:\r\n\r\n In reply to this, I can only say that there is a distinct notice given\r\n on the Dispensary cards as well as in the waiting room, when Dr.\r\n Sewall or I, or when Dr. Storer is in attendance, so that patients can\r\n have their choice.\r\n\r\nInteresting features of the annual meeting of the Hospital for this\r\nyear and of a levee which followed it, were an address by Dr. Elizabeth\r\nBlackwell on “The Culture Necessary for a Physician,” and a reading of\r\nsome charming poems by Mrs. Julia Ward Howe.\r\n\r\nHand in hand with the growth of Dr. Zakrzewska’s Hospital work\r\nprogressed the growth of her private practice. And the year 1865 was\r\nnotable in that for the first time she felt able to set up a carriage\r\nin proper medical style. She thus describes this felicitous occurrence:\r\n\r\n In 1865, I bought a second-hand buggy and a horse for two reasons: one\r\n was that I could not accomplish and do justice to my professional work\r\n by using public conveyances; the other, that it became a matter of\r\n necessity to uphold the professional etiquette and dignity of a woman\r\n physician on equality with men. The effect was marvelous. Even the\r\n newspapers took notice of the change.\r\n\r\nAt the Hospital further advance was made by the creation of the staff\r\nposition of assistant surgeon, Dr. Anita E. Tyng[11] receiving the\r\nappointment. Thus for the first time in America the name of a woman\r\nis listed officially as specializing in surgery. This year was also\r\nnotable for the addition of a second consulting physician, Dr. Henry I.\r\nBowditch accepting election.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry I. Bowditch was always an earnest supporter of the education\r\nof women as physicians. He befriended Dr. Harriot K. Hunt and Dr.\r\nNancy Clark, and then Dr. Zakrzewska herself when the latter came to\r\nBoston in 1856 soliciting money for opening the New York Infirmary.\r\nHe remained the steadfast champion of medical women and continued as\r\nconsulting physician to the New England Hospital until his death in\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nDr. Zakrzewska realized the necessity of having on the consulting\r\nstaff of the Hospital men physicians of the highest standing in the\r\nprofession, such men serving as vouchers to the community for the\r\nmedical women and their hospital.\r\n\r\nBut aside from this vital consideration she also believed that the best\r\nresults follow when men and women work together. In this conviction she\r\nwas ably supported by Dr. Henry I. Bowditch, who wrote to her at one\r\ntime:\r\n\r\n In regard to having a full corps of well-known experts, male and\r\n female, connected with the hospital, I still have no doubt. As I think\r\n there should be women physicians and surgeons in the other hospitals,\r\n so I think it important for the fullest success to have a joint\r\n corps at the women’s hospital. Also, I cannot but think it would be\r\n beneficial pecuniarily to all the hospitals if such arrangements were\r\n made.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Dr. Bowditch was prepared to go even further, for in another\r\nletter he expresses the opinion that all three hospitals--the New\r\nEngland, the Massachusetts General and the City, should throw open\r\ntheir clinical instruction to both men and women. Though he was still\r\nconservative enough to advise that the clinics should be held at\r\ndifferent hours for the two sexes.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the increasing support given the Hospital, its financial\r\nsituation continued to cause anxiety. This was due to the need for\r\npaying for the four buildings purchased, to the increased expenses of\r\nthe expanded institution, and to the disproportionately large amount of\r\nservice given free or at only nominal rates.\r\n\r\nThe acuteness of the problem continued to increase and in the following\r\nyear (1865-1866), although the mortgages had been paid off and the\r\ngeneral debt reduced, the institution was unable to pay its current\r\nexpenses.\r\n\r\nTo meet this situation a more conservative course was felt to be\r\nimperative, and it was decided, except in Maternity cases, temporarily\r\nto discontinue receiving any patients at a reduced rate except in the\r\nfree beds, those which were endowed or definitely subscribed for.\r\n\r\nDr. Tyng continued as assistant surgeon, and her progress was so\r\nsatisfactory that Dr. Storer writes:\r\n\r\n During July and August, I shall be able to visit the Hospital only\r\n on Saturdays. During my absence, I wish Dr. Tyng, in accordance with\r\n her duties as assistant surgeon, to take my place as concerns both\r\n the Dispensary and the Surgical Wards. Of course, operations of any\r\n magnitude will be reserved until the days of my attendance.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this peaceful development and orderly progress, clouds\r\nsuddenly gathered and a tempest broke forth, with much lightning\r\nthough with little thunder. This was followed by the clearing of the\r\nair characteristic of the passing of tempests in this latitude but,\r\nas sometimes happens, a marked change in the local landscape was the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe storm center seems to have been Dr. Storer. It is often difficult\r\nto explain misunderstandings and disagreements. Frequently, no one\r\nperson seems to be definitely responsible. Electric conditions develop\r\nfrom many causes; minor frictions occur; an accident produces a spark;\r\nand an explosion follows.\r\n\r\nDr. Storer was connected with the Boston Lying-in Hospital before that\r\ninstitution suspended operation. He later became connected with the New\r\nEngland Hospital as already related, beginning then to specialize in\r\nthe diseases of women. He worked assiduously in his department, and he\r\naccepted the letter of his obligations to the Hospital.\r\n\r\nSubsequent history shows that this acceptance did not include the\r\nconvictions of the spirit. Perhaps a psychoanalyst of to-day would\r\ntrace the ultimate explosion to the “complex” resulting from conflict\r\nbetween this letter and spirit.\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps (as suggested by the primary resignation of Dr. Cabot) it\r\nwas a technical disagreement as to the limits of the respective domains\r\nof attending and consulting staffs--always a subject filled with\r\ndelicate potentialities.\r\n\r\nOr, perhaps, as claimed by Dr. Mary Putnam-Jacobi (_Woman’s Work\r\nin America_, published in 1891), a most careful and conscientious\r\nobserver with the true scientific spirit, it was because the successful\r\noutcome of Dr. Storer’s operations fell too often below the boldness\r\nof his conceptions of them. (Dr. Sewall in this year says in her\r\nreport as resident physician, “Only three deaths have occurred among\r\nour patients, and all these took place in the surgical wards after\r\nhazardous operations.”)\r\n\r\nBe the explanations--one or all--as they may, the first outward\r\nmanifestation of the storm was the receipt by the board of directors of\r\nthe following letter from Dr. Samuel Cabot, the early and long-tried\r\nfriend of the Hospital who had from the beginning served as consulting\r\nsurgeon:\r\n\r\n  _Boston, June 2, 1866._\r\n\r\n _To the Board of Directors of the New England Hospital For Women and\r\n Children._\r\n\r\n  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n Feeling as I do the very warmest interest in the cause of female\r\n education and advancement, and believing as I do that the path of\r\n medicine and surgery, as well as every other path to honor and profit,\r\n should be open to women as well as to men--still, I feel constrained\r\n to send you my resignation of the office of Consulting Surgeon to\r\n the New England Hospital for Women and Children with which you have\r\n honored me, and to request you at your earliest convenience to accept\r\n it and to appoint my successor.\r\n\r\n I cannot enter into any explanation of my reasons for this step, and\r\n can only ask you to believe that it is from no loss of interest in\r\n the cause you represent nor from any dissatisfaction with the ladies\r\n connected with the Hospital.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n  S. CABOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis resignation was accepted with great regret when after consultation\r\nit was found to be irrevocable.\r\n\r\nThis letter having brought the subject of consulting physicians to\r\nthe attention of the directors, after much thought and inquiry the\r\nfollowing preamble and resolutions were unanimously passed at their\r\nregular meeting on August 13:\r\n\r\n WHEREAS, the confidence of the public in the management of\r\n the Hospital rests not only on the character of the medical attendants\r\n having its immediate charge but also on the high reputation of its\r\n Consulting Physicians and Surgeons, and\r\n\r\n WHEREAS, we cannot allow them to be responsible for cases\r\n over which they have no control, therefore,\r\n\r\n _Resolved_, that in all unusual or difficult cases in medicine,\r\n or where a capital operation in surgery is proposed, the Attending\r\n and Resident Physicians and Surgeons shall hold mutual consultation,\r\n and if any one of them shall have doubt as to the propriety of the\r\n proposed treatment or operation, one or more of the Consulting\r\n Physicians or Surgeons shall be invited to examine and decide upon\r\n the case.\r\n\r\n _Voted_, that a copy of this resolve be sent to all medical\r\n officers connected with this Hospital\r\n\r\nOn September 10, the board of directors received from Dr. Storer a\r\nletter containing his resignation as attending surgeon, and on this\r\nletter the report comments, “Its tenor left the Board no alternative\r\nbut its acceptance, which was unanimously voted.”\r\n\r\nThe report then continues,\r\n\r\n The Directors would, however, take this first public occasion to\r\n express their sense of the value of Dr. Storer’s professional services\r\n and of the aid which he has rendered to the Treasury of the Hospital.\r\n Cheerfully bearing witness to his talent and active zeal in his\r\n profession, they offer him their best wishes for his future success.\r\n\r\nDr. Storer’s letter containing his resignation was remarkable for its\r\nexpressions of misunderstanding of the resolutions quoted above and for\r\nits misrepresentation of the general charitable policy of the Hospital.\r\nBut it was chiefly remarkable for the needlessly offensive manner in\r\nwhich the writer revealed his personal disapproval of the study of\r\nmedicine by women. Yet he condescended on second thought to qualify the\r\nlatter statement, by adding:\r\n\r\n For certain of the professional ladies whom I have met, I have\r\n personally the highest respect and esteem. Miss Zakrzewska, the\r\n beauty and purity of whose life as already published to the world I\r\n have long seen verified, may well challenge comparison in practice\r\n with a certain percentage of my own sex. Miss Tyng, now for two\r\n years my assistant in private practice, has such natural tastes and\r\n inclinations as fit her, more than I should have supposed any woman\r\n could have become fitted, for the anxieties, the nervous strain and\r\n the shocks of the practice of surgery. And there are others not now\r\n officially connected with the Hospital whose names I would mention in\r\n terms of similar commendation.\r\n\r\n Such are, however, at the best, but very exceptional cases, and I am\r\n driven back to my old belief, the same that is entertained by the mass\r\n of mankind, that in claiming this especial work of medicine women have\r\n mistaken their calling.\r\n\r\nAn interesting by-action of the writer was his concurrent sending of\r\nthis extraordinary letter of resignation to the _Boston Medical and\r\nSurgical Journal_ for publication. This journal has already been\r\nquoted as being opposed to the entrance of women into the medical\r\nprofession, and at this time and for many subsequent years, it still\r\ncontinued its attitude of opposition.\r\n\r\nIt is of a certain interest to note here that Dr. Storer once more\r\nemerged in public to express his sex-peculiar views regarding women\r\nphysicians. This was in San Francisco in 1871, when, at the annual\r\nmeeting of the American Medical Association, the question of women\r\nas delegates and members was brought into the debate upon a related\r\nsubject. In the discussion, Dr. Storer spoke in opposition, saying:\r\n\r\n ... We will grant that some exceptional women are as interested in\r\n our science as ourselves; that some of them have those peculiar\r\n qualities, that especial temperament, that gives them not merely a\r\n taste for anatomy and surgery but courage to face the greatest dangers\r\n and anxiety in surgery; and that there are some women who are able\r\n to go out in inclement weather and brave the storm. We may grant\r\n that women, some of them, may have had peculiar means or favorable\r\n opportunities which allow them to get this same education that men\r\n have. We may grant, and grant it freely, that in some matters, women\r\n intellectually, are as completely mistresses of their subject as we\r\n are masters of ours.\r\n\r\n But, beyond this there is a point that is fundamental to the whole\r\n matter ... and that is, this inherent quality in their sex, that\r\n uncertain equilibrium, that varying from month to month according to\r\n the time of the month in each woman that unfits her for taking these\r\n responsibilities of judgment which are to control the question often\r\n of life and death ... women from month to month and week to week vary\r\n up and down; they are not the same one time that they are another.\r\n\r\nTo this, Dr. Gibbons of San Francisco replied:\r\n\r\n If we are to judge of this proposition by the arguments of my friend\r\n from Boston, I think it would prove conclusively the weakness of his\r\n side of the question.... Is it not a fact that a large majority of\r\n male practitioners fluctuate in their judgment, not once a month with\r\n the moon, but every day with the movement of the sun....\r\n\r\nThus are some of the humorous pages of history made.\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to have been the last time that the subject of\r\nwomen as members was discussed in that Association. In 1876, the\r\nfirst woman delegate (Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson, from the Illinois\r\nState Medical Society) was seated amid cheers. And in 1877, Dr. Henry\r\nI. Bowditch of Boston, in his presidential address, congratulated the\r\nAssociation that women physicians had been invited to assist in the\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n _New England Hospital students granted the privilege of visiting\r\n Massachusetts General Hospital--Letter from University of Zurich\r\n stating women are admitted on equal terms with men--Extracts from\r\n letter by Dr. Zakrzewska to Dr. Sewall on vacation in Europe--Sophia\r\n Jex-Blake collects endowment for four free beds--Dr. Samuel Cabot\r\n resumes his position of consulting surgeon--Dr. Zakrzewska resigns\r\n from service at the Dispensary, being succeeded by Dr. Helen\r\n Morton--Dr. Zakrzewska shares her service at the Hospital with Dr.\r\n Sewall who is appointed second attending physician--Land bought in\r\n Roxbury for new Hospital buildings. (1866-1871.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nReturning to our chronicle of 1866, the immediate consequence of the\r\nforegoing tempest was that the Hospital remained for the rest of the\r\nyear without either attending or consulting surgeon, the surgical\r\ncases being treated by the assistant surgeon, with the aid of Dr.\r\nSamuel Cabot (acting unofficially), and by the attending and resident\r\nphysicians--Dr. Zakrzewska and Dr. Sewall.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of this year notes the receipt of the first annual\r\nreport of the Chicago Hospital for Women and Children, founded by Dr.\r\nMary Harris Thompson.[12] This institution may be called the oldest\r\nhospital daughter of Dr. Zakrzewska, a previous attempt by Dr. C.\r\nAnnette Buckel[13] to open a woman’s hospital being obliged to yield in\r\nits infancy to the greater interests excited by the outbreak of the\r\nCivil War, Dr. Buckel giving her services to the Sanitary Commission.\r\n\r\nAn important event of the year 1866-1867 was the granting to the\r\nNew England Hospital students of the privilege of visiting the\r\nMassachusetts General Hospital under certain restrictions.\r\n\r\nThe house at 14 Warren Street (changed to Warrenton Street the\r\nfollowing year) was now used for the medical and surgical wards and\r\nfor the offices of the assistant physician and the matron. Of the\r\nPleasant Street houses, No. 13 was the house of the resident physician,\r\nNo. 15 contained the Lying-in Wards, and No. 17 was given over to the\r\nDispensary.\r\n\r\nOnce more the course of the Hospital becomes the uneventful one of\r\nquiet, continuous growth, and Dr. Zakrzewska as attending physician\r\nconcludes her report for 1867-1868, as follows:\r\n\r\n The Hospital and Dispensary are established; many physicians who a few\r\n years ago were opposed to female practitioners have not only become\r\n convinced of their professional capability, but several have been\r\n willing to give instruction and aid in any way possible.\r\n\r\n The Massachusetts General Hospital has been admitting the few students\r\n whom we consider under our guidance and instruction. We have good\r\n reason to hope that this friendly relation will continue. Harvard\r\n College is still closed against us for theoretical instruction, but\r\n I do not think that free, liberal America will remain long behind\r\n another republic across the ocean--I mean Switzerland.\r\n\r\n One of our students who made application to the University of Zurich,\r\n received the following reply:\r\n\r\n  _Zurich, May 6, 1868._\r\n\r\n  DEAR MADAM:\r\n\r\n I reply to your letter of March 17 which has just come to hand. I have\r\n the honor to inform you that there exists in this University no lawful\r\n impediment to the matriculation of female students, and that female\r\n students enjoy equal advantages with male students.\r\n\r\n _There is here full liberty_, and every one may attend the\r\n lectures as long as he may desire. The majority of the students need\r\n from five to five and a half years’ course before taking their degree.\r\n\r\n In answer to other questions of yours, I send you some printed\r\n regulations of the University.\r\n\r\n I am, with great esteem,\r\n\r\n  Yours,\r\n  BIERMER,\r\n  Professor and Dean of Medical Faculty.\r\n\r\n The University of Zurich is known as one where only men of the highest\r\n standing in the profession are employed to instruct the students.\r\n Such names as Moleschott, Griesinger, Breslau, von Graefe, Horner,\r\n Mayer, and Billroth are familiar as authorities in the medical world,\r\n and these men have been, and still are, the most influential teachers\r\n there.\r\n\r\n In Paris, also, women can have the same advantages as men. And in\r\n America the time is rapidly approaching when through the deeds and\r\n words of women the profession at large will be convinced of the wisdom\r\n of following the same course.\r\n\r\nA breath of encouragement was at this time wafted from New York in\r\na speech by Dr. Willard Parker, this noted physician saying at the\r\nopening of the Woman’s College of the New York Infirmary, which took\r\nplace on November 2, 1868:\r\n\r\n Woman has always been a helpmeet to man and to a great extent is a\r\n co-worker with him, and as such in medicine, I bid her Godspeed. If\r\n it is charged that women who study medicine are sometimes unfit for\r\n practice, I would answer--so are many men. A doctor is born, not made,\r\n and is, naturally, found in both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1868, Dr. Lucy E. Sewall, who was continuing as\r\nresident physician, took a vacation of three months in England and\r\nFrance for recreation and study. In a letter to her, dated July 16, Dr.\r\nZakrzewska writing from her new address, No. 1041 Washington Street,\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n I have hardly anything to report except that we have had intensely hot\r\n weather since you left, such as I have not experienced since the first\r\n year of my arrival in America. The thermometer stood at ninety-six\r\n degrees in our parlor in Roxbury, and we felt that we were cooling\r\n ourselves when we entered there. Yesterday, it was one hundred and\r\n three in the shade out of doors.... I envied you very much when I read\r\n how cool you were in Halifax and thereabouts. I am sure I would have\r\n been very glad to play the lady with you. You will now understand how\r\n pleasant it is to be away from business for a while.\r\n\r\n Dr. Buckel will write you all about the Hospital. You need not worry\r\n in the least as all is going on well. At our last Hospital meeting\r\n Mrs. Cheney reported, “I feared very much for the Hospital when I saw\r\n how heartbroken the patients were after Dr. Sewall’s departure. But a\r\n day after they sang the praises of Dr. Buckel as loudly as if they had\r\n never known Dr. Sewall.”\r\n\r\n To this report I added, “It is the old story although a very\r\n unsatisfactory one. Our places are filled just as soon as we leave\r\n them. And we all have to learn that lesson and feel comforted by it\r\n because it is thus that the world does not get off its hinges.”\r\n\r\n The day before yesterday, we had our housewarming--I missed you very\r\n much.... The heat has prevented me from going to Melrose [Dr. Sewall’s\r\n home] so far; all we can do is to live and to fan....\r\n\r\nWithin the two years just closing, the financial pressure began to be\r\nrelieved and four free beds were established in the medical wards.\r\nAbout the same time, it was decided to charge at the Dispensary a\r\nfee of twenty-five cents to such of the patients as were able to pay\r\nthis amount. The results exceeded all expectations. The patients\r\nacknowledged the fairness of the rule and yet the really poor were not\r\nshut out.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it was at the close of this year, as already noted, that\r\nthe Hospital was obliged to borrow money to meet its outstanding debts.\r\n\r\nThis was truly the darkest hour and it was followed by the dawn of\r\nwhich the proverb speaks. As the sunshine of help from the community\r\ngrew stronger, it was possible steadily to extend the ministrations of\r\nthe Hospital to the more dependent, so the report of 1898-1899 was able\r\nto state:\r\n\r\n Nearly (if not quite) two thirds of all our work is given in charity\r\n ... though we are slow to give charity indiscriminately but would\r\n have each one make some return, however small, for benefits received,\r\n thereby aiding her to keep her self-respect.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer’s report for the year of 1868 notes the receipt of one\r\nthousand dollars which was collected by Miss Sophia Jex-Blake for\r\nsupporting four free beds. Sophia Jex-Blake came to this country as a\r\nstudent of Dr. Sewall and was a resident student at the Hospital. She\r\nwent later to the newly opened Woman’s Medical College of the New York\r\nInfirmary, and still later she returned to Great Britain and became the\r\nleader in the struggle which attended the attempt to open to women the\r\nmedical course at the University of Edinburgh--reference to which has\r\nbeen made by Dr. Zakrzewska in a previous chapter. The attempt failed\r\nand she went to Switzerland where the men students at the University\r\nof Berne seemed to find no difficulty in permitting women to study\r\nmedicine with them.[14]\r\n\r\nThe year of 1869 was especially noteworthy for the burden which was\r\nlifted from Dr. Zakrzewska’s mind by the official return of Dr. Samuel\r\nCabot to the consulting staff of the Hospital, though ever since his\r\nformal resignation in June, 1866, he had continued to advise the women\r\nwho, against almost insurmountable obstacles, were struggling to\r\ngive the surgical help called for by the increasing numbers of their\r\npatients.\r\n\r\nIf one requires expert teaching and constant practice to learn to\r\ndiagnosticate and prescribe for medical ailments, it is much more\r\ndifficult for one to learn to diagnosticate and prescribe for surgical\r\nailments, since a surgical prescription demands trained skill of the\r\nhands as well as of the brain. And opportunities for acquiring this\r\ntrained skill of the hands are at the best very limited in number and\r\nvery expensive in detail, while they also require a very exacting\r\nenvironment and an entourage trained to the highest degree. And they\r\nare, further, beset on all sides by dangers which are momentous and\r\nimmediate as well as more remote.\r\n\r\nIt is a fine index of the essential quality of these earlier women that\r\nthey were not daunted by the difficulties of the situation, and that\r\nthe conservative spirit of the sex was not too much affrighted by the\r\ndangers which on every hand confronted them and their patients.\r\n\r\nUnder the necessities of the situation, a friendly surgeon of the\r\neminence of Dr. Samuel Cabot was a veritable tower of strength.\r\nWell might Dr. Zakrzewska, with gratitude that failed of words to\r\nexpress itself, say year after year in her annual report as attending\r\nphysician, “To Dr. Samuel Cabot, we are again indebted for advice and\r\ninstruction in all the important surgical cases which have occurred\r\nduring the year.”\r\n\r\nDr. Anita E. Tyng who had spent her apprenticeship as assistant surgeon\r\nto the Hospital, had been obliged to resign her position there, but Dr.\r\nZakrzewska and Dr. Sewall were ably assisted in this branch of practice\r\nby Dr. C. Annette Buckel who had been assistant physician for the past\r\nthree years and who, having particular ability for surgery, desired\r\nto specialize in that direction. They were now aided also by Dr. Helen\r\nMorton[15] who had returned from Paris and had become connected with\r\nthe Dispensary.\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of such capable assistants among the younger\r\nwomen who had all been her students, Dr. Zakrzewska felt justified\r\nin relinquishing some of her arduous duties. And now her leading\r\nassistant, Dr. Lucy E. Sewall, resigned as resident physician (a\r\nposition which she had held since 1863) and was appointed second\r\nattending physician. She thus divided the Hospital service with Dr.\r\nZakrzewska, each being on duty every alternate three months.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIE E. ZAKRZEWSKA, M.D. (About 1870)]\r\n\r\nDr. Zakrzewska continued to serve on the board of directors as she had\r\ndone since the beginning of the Hospital, but the added freedom gained\r\nby being released from work at the Dispensary and in being able to\r\nshare her Hospital duties, gave her greater opportunity to elaborate\r\nand press forward her plans for building a hospital which should be\r\nmore suitable for its purposes than any altered dwelling houses could\r\npossibly be. Writing of the successes achieved by the Hospital and of\r\nthe satisfactions derived from its possession of the four houses in\r\nWarrenton and Pleasant streets, she continues:\r\n\r\n But after a few years, we found that even these accommodations were\r\n becoming too small. Also, the character of the neighborhood was\r\n changing from private residences to retail trading stores, and it was\r\n easy to foresee that the time was coming when this location would be\r\n entirely unsuitable for the sick.\r\n\r\n As it was neither my intention nor that of the Directors to carry\r\n on simply a charity, but rather to make this charity at the same\r\n time a school for educating women physicians on the European plan\r\n before mentioned and for the training of nurses for the benefit of\r\n the community, we felt that confidence in the value and need of our\r\n work had now been sufficiently established to warrant our erecting\r\n a building which would serve all these purposes and which in its\r\n arrangement might become a model hospital among the charitable\r\n institutions of the country.\r\n\r\nAbout this time an especially interesting bequest of two thousand\r\ndollars was received by the Hospital from the estate of Mrs. Robert G.\r\nShaw, the language of the bequest stating that the money was “to be\r\nused by Dr. Zakrzewska in aid of any Hospital or Infirmary for the poor\r\nand sick which may be under her superintendence in the City of Boston\r\nat the time of my decease.”\r\n\r\nThe accumulating demand for a children’s ward in the Hospital was\r\nso strongly felt this year that one of the physicians took into her\r\nown household for care and treatment a child patient whose case was\r\nparticularly urgent.\r\n\r\nThis pressure for a children’s ward was an additional factor in making\r\nDr. Zakrzewska and her associates begin a still more definite campaign\r\nfor the erection of new hospital buildings which should be especially\r\nsuitable for the varied demands made upon them. Alterations in the\r\nstreets and increase of business in that part of the city had enhanced\r\nthe pecuniary value of land in that vicinity, so it was hoped that the\r\nsale of the present property would supply the money needed for building\r\nthe new structure. It was planned to hold a Fair in December in order\r\nto raise the money needed for the purchase of the new land.\r\n\r\nAnd one may judge of the courage required to attempt to carry such\r\nambitions into execution when it is noted that the institution had just\r\nheld its own financially, the year closing with the same amount of debt\r\nas that with which it began.\r\n\r\nThe Fair in December, 1870, justified the ardent hopes which breathed\r\nthrough every detail of its preparation and completion, and over twelve\r\nthousand dollars was realized.\r\n\r\nA committee was immediately appointed to select a site, and after much\r\ninvestigation this committee recommended the purchase of an estate in\r\nBoston Highlands (now Roxbury), on Codman Avenue (now Dimock Street),\r\nbetween Shawmut Avenue (now Washington Street) and Amory Street (now\r\nColumbus Avenue).\r\n\r\nWith the formation of a building committee (which included all the\r\nmedical officers) the new venture was definitely launched. The skies\r\nwere lifting, favoring breezes prevailed, and the year closed with\r\nall running expenses met, all debts paid, and only the new building\r\nexpenses to confront the treasurer--but it must be admitted that these\r\nwere formidable enough, since they were on such an expanded scale.\r\n\r\nThe report of the resident physician, Dr. Buckel, for the year of\r\n1870-1871 reflects so clearly her association with Dr. Zakrzewska\r\nand contains such interesting pictures of some phases of the social\r\nlife of the period that a few paragraphs may be quoted, especially as\r\nsome of them bear upon variations of a question which to-day is still\r\nperplexing our community, and which has at last reached legislators all\r\nover the United States in a concrete and radical form.[16]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n _New Hospital buildings completed--Description of buildings and\r\n interior arrangements--Children’s Department established--First\r\n general Training School for Nurses in America definitely organized\r\n under the direction of Dr. Susan Dimock; one of the graduates of\r\n its first class (Miss Linda A. Richards) later helping to organize\r\n the training schools of the Bellevue Hospital of New York, the\r\n Massachusetts General Hospital and the Boston City Hospital--New\r\n England Hospital medical women invited to attend some of the Clinics\r\n at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary--Though delayed by the\r\n epizoötic epidemic and the great Boston Fire, the new Hospital\r\n buildings are finally formally dedicated--First Hospital Social\r\n Service in America organized in connection with the Maternity.\r\n (1871-1872.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitects, contractors, builders and workmen, all took a personal\r\ninterest in the plans of the new Hospital buildings, and all made\r\nlarger or smaller contributions to the enterprise. With such a spirit\r\nthe structure grew apace, and even early in the spring of 1872 a few\r\npatients were moved in--some who especially needed the advantages of\r\nthe good air, sunlight and almost country quiet. But all the patients\r\nwere transferred before the end of September.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIRST BUILDINGS OF THE NEW ENGLAND HOSPITAL FOR\r\nWOMEN AND CHILDREN, ERECTED 1872.\r\n\r\nThe main building was later named in honor of Dr. Marie E. Zakrzewska.]\r\n\r\nDr. Zakrzewska writes:\r\n\r\n At last we were able definitely to inaugurate the work for which we\r\n had been preparing during the previous ten years, namely, to dedicate\r\n our own building to our threefold object--a clinical school for women\r\n physicians and students; a training school for nurses; and a charity,\r\n especially for lying-in patients.\r\n\r\n For this latter purpose a cottage, the “Maternity,” was expressly\r\n built, while the medical and surgical patients occupied the main\r\n building. Some rooms were reserved for private patients, who paid\r\n fully for all they received. This latter department is very desirable\r\n in all hospitals, not only for the accommodation of travelers who\r\n may be taken ill while sojourning in a strange city, but also for\r\n those who when boarding cannot have the comforts of a home; while it\r\n likewise gives to our nurses a fair chance to be trained in attendance\r\n upon the sick of all classes and conditions of life.\r\n\r\n Thus we had arrived nearly at the point at which we aimed, only that\r\n the means needed to carry on the work were not yet secured. We had no\r\n endowed wards and we had only a few endowed beds in the Maternity;\r\n therefore, we had no _Funds_ but must depend upon the daily\r\n interest of the public to sustain the institution.\r\n\r\n We now offered to the public not only the idea of reform, as we\r\n comprehended it, but also the visible embodiment of it in brick and\r\n mortar. Our vision had become materialized, and the work done within\r\n its walls spread the tidings of its success among the suffering and\r\n the needy.\r\n\r\n The Drs. Blackwell, Ann Preston and myself stood no longer alone as\r\n the bearers of an idea--hundreds of young women had joined us. The\r\n path had been broken, and the profession had been obliged to yield,\r\n and to acknowledge the capacity of women as physicians. The argument\r\n that we few were exceptions to our sex has ceased; medical societies\r\n in different parts of the country admit women as members; hospitals\r\n begin to open their doors to women; men physicians endeavor to be\r\n polite towards their women colleagues; and their women colleagues\r\n certainly stand on a level with the men as regards good education.\r\n\r\n And last but not least, society admits that it is highly respectable\r\n for a woman to become legally a physician, and offices and houses are\r\n now rented to medical women without fear of injury to the reputation\r\n of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n Thus, the world does move! But I am sorry to be forced to say that it\r\n is not the Republic of America which has given the proof that “science\r\n has no sex,” only in so far as that it has furnished the largest\r\n number of women students. But it is the Republic of Switzerland which\r\n has verified this maxim. Our best women physicians have been educated\r\n there as well as in Germany and in France--for even these two latter\r\n countries have received women into their schools more on an equality\r\n with men than has America. And not less than six of our pupils from\r\n Boston are at present receiving the benefits which the opportunities\r\n for medical study and research offer in Vienna.\r\n\r\n The United States still hesitate to allow to their women that\r\n education which they offer to their men. The result will be that\r\n talented women will go abroad and seek for the better medical\r\n education which Europe offers them and, returning with a higher\r\n standard of scientific learning, the men here will not only be obliged\r\n to acknowledge such women as their equals but they will be compelled\r\n to raise their own professional standards.\r\n\r\n So far as my knowledge extends, this will be the first instance in\r\n history where through injustice to women, men themselves will be\r\n benefited.\r\n\r\nThe plan was to have one large brick building which should contain all\r\nthe administrative offices of the Hospital as well as a small number\r\nof medical and surgical wards, the intention being to add later a wing\r\nentirely devoted to wards. But the Lying-in Department was to be housed\r\nin an entirely separate structure.[17]\r\n\r\nQuite as essential and desired a policy of expansion, but one which had\r\nwaited on the new building, was that of the training of nurses.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the importance which Dr. Zakrzewska attached to this\r\nquestion ever since her first hospital control, back in the days when\r\nshe organized the practical details of the New York Infirmary. And we\r\nhave noticed the recurring references to the difficulties which delayed\r\nthe full development of her plans. But she continued to exercise her\r\nchoice of individuals as best she might, and she endeavored to give\r\nthe most thorough training for as long periods as she could make\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nThus, writing of the opening of the New York Infirmary on May 1, 1857,\r\nshe says:\r\n\r\n We kept true to our promise to begin at once a system for training\r\n nurses although the time specified for that purpose was only six\r\n months.\r\n\r\nShe began with two nurses, one of whom remained for several years,\r\nbecoming invaluable as head nurse. But she was evidently not satisfied\r\nwith the success of this first system for, eight months later, she\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n We now began to make more positive plans for the education and\r\n training of nurses. The first two who presented herself and who after\r\n four months’ superior women, one a German, the other an American, but\r\n neither was willing to give a longer time than four months. During\r\n this time they received no compensation except their keeping and one\r\n weekly lesson from me on the different branches of nursing.\r\n\r\n After these left, it was again a German woman who presented herself\r\n and who after four months’ training remained for several years. The\r\n second pupil nurse was sometimes of American, sometimes of Irish,\r\n descent and nothing remarkable.\r\n\r\nWhen she removed to Boston and opened the hospital (Clinical\r\nDepartment) in connection with the New England Female Medical College,\r\nshe there also attempted to carry into execution her conviction of the\r\nnecessity for training nurses. But in Boston as in New York, women\r\nwho wished to be nurses were unwilling to give time for training, and\r\napplications were few. Nevertheless, she succeeded in training six\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\nWhen she founded the New England Hospital, the act of incorporation\r\nexpressly stated that the training of nurses was one of the fundamental\r\npurposes of the new institution. And the first annual report says:\r\n\r\n We offer peculiar advantages for training nurses for their important\r\n duties, under the superintendence of a physician.\r\n\r\nIn 1865, the term of six months is again emphasized. In 1868, it is\r\nstated that the Hospital offers to candidates board, washing and\r\nlow wages after the first month of probation but it insists on an\r\nattendance of six months. And it adds that few women are willing to\r\ngive the requisite time.\r\n\r\nBut now, at last, she found the desired opportunities opening before\r\nher. Aside from the influence of European experience, and especially\r\nthat of Florence Nightingale and of the subsequent writings and\r\nutterances of the latter, undoubtedly the agitation which demonstrated\r\nthe necessity for practical hospital training for the medical\r\nprofession, had its effect in preparing the minds of both men and women\r\nfor the realization of the fact that the same necessity existed for the\r\ntraining of members of the sister profession of nursing.\r\n\r\nAnd the lectures to the New England Hospital nurses (which, under\r\ncertain conditions, were open to women from outside) were steadily\r\nattracting women who were better and better prepared to study a\r\nprofession rather than merely to practice an art.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Zakrzewska had still found herself hampered by the narrow\r\nquarters which restricted her plans for nurses as well as for doctors,\r\nstudents and patients. She had been still further limited by the human\r\nimpossibility of even her vigorous strength and endurance being equal\r\nto the superhuman demands developed by the successful materialization\r\nof her vision. And the training of assistants and colleagues required\r\nprimarily a sacrifice of the time and energy already imperatively\r\nmortgaged.\r\n\r\nNow, not only was the material building ready for the Hospital, but\r\nalso there was there incarnated the spirit of a common purpose, a\r\nspirit into the creation of which she had so literally incorporated her\r\nown self.\r\n\r\nHence, as the executive Head, she now had at her command not only a\r\ncommodious structure but also director associates; a corps of younger\r\nphysicians, trained theoretically and practically in both medicine\r\nand surgery; a supply of patients, always beyond the possibilities of\r\naccommodation; and a promising reservoir of aspiring women accepting\r\nand demanding training in nursing.\r\n\r\nImmediately then, upon the opening of the new building, steps were\r\ntaken for the expansion of the New England Hospital Training School for\r\nNurses, and for its establishment as the “first general training school\r\nfor nurses in America,” organized and equipped to give general training\r\nalong the then most modern practical lines, with a full corps of\r\ninstructors in all branches, and with a hospital service that included\r\nmedicine, surgery and obstetrics. This change was described in the\r\nannual reports of the year of 1871-1872, by Dr. Sewall in the medical\r\nreport and by Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney as secretary of the corporation.\r\n\r\nIn addition to performing her duties at the Hospital and attending\r\nto her continually expanding private practice, Dr. Zakrzewska served\r\non both the building committee and the furnishing committee for the\r\nnew hospital. But while, among the staff of medical instructors, she\r\ndelivered the greatest number of lectures, the details of organizing\r\nthe new Training School for Nurses were delegated to Dr. Susan\r\nDimock,[18] who became resident physician in August when Dr. Buckel\r\nreceived leave of absence to go to Europe for rest and study.\r\n\r\nDuring the first year of the new Training School for Nurses ten\r\napplicants were accepted after probation, two of these completing\r\nthe year and being graduated. One of these first graduates was Miss\r\nLinda A. Richards who later helped to organize the Bellevue Hospital\r\n(New York) Training School, and still later that of the Massachusetts\r\nGeneral Hospital and that of the Boston City Hospital.\r\n\r\nDuring this eventful year, two important financial losses shadowed the\r\nhigh light thrown upon the foregoing successful working out of the\r\nfar-reaching plans which Dr. Zakrzewska had for so long labored to\r\ndevelop. These were the loss of the annual donations of one thousand\r\ndollars each from the Legislature of Massachusetts and from the Boston\r\nLying-in Hospital Corporation--the former having voted against any\r\nappropriation to private charities, and the latter having decided to\r\nreopen a hospital under its own control, in the overcrowded part of the\r\ncity. Hence, it was again considered expedient to plan for a December\r\nFair. But many days of doubt and hesitancy were to precede the opening\r\nof this Fair.\r\n\r\nIt had been planned to have the formal dedication of the new building\r\ntake place at the time of the annual meeting of the board of directors.\r\nAs this day approached it was found that it would be impossible for the\r\nfriends of the enterprise to reach the new location of the Hospital.\r\nThe great epizootic epidemic was prevailing; horses were everywhere\r\nsuccumbing to its virulence, and all the activities of the city which\r\ndepended upon these necessary animals were almost paralyzed.\r\n\r\nA fortnight later traffic was more controllable, but in the meantime\r\nevery one had passed through the calamity of the great “Boston Fire,”\r\nand Mrs. Cheney spoke the language of restraint when she said, “It was\r\nnot easy to go to men whose warehouses and offices were in ashes, or to\r\nwomen who had lost their investments in insurance, and ask them to give\r\nus the money that we needed to complete our building and to carry on\r\nour work.”\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it redounded to the credit of both the\r\nhospital workers and the community of Boston that the formal opening of\r\nthe Hospital was not longer delayed, that the Fair was held in December\r\nas planned, and that it resulted in a sum exceeding five thousand\r\ndollars.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that it was also during this year that the\r\nfirst Hospital Social Service work in America was begun. This was\r\norganized in connection with the Maternity--Dr. Dimock, Miss Lilian\r\nFreeman Clarke, Miss Elizabeth Greene and Miss Mary Parkman coöperating.\r\n\r\nAnd this year was further marked by the opening to the New England\r\nHospital medical women of some of the clinics of the Massachusetts Eye\r\nand Ear Infirmary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n _Dr. Zakrzewska goes to Europe for her first vacation in fifteen\r\n years--Letter to Dr. Sewall from Switzerland--Dr. Helen Morton is\r\n appointed third attending physician to the Hospital (in charge of\r\n the Maternity)--Tragic death of Dr. Dimock--For the first time the\r\n Hospital has a woman on the staff as attending surgeon, Dr. C.

(1872-1877.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addition of a third attending physician at the Hospital (Dr. Helen\r\nMorton who took charge of the Maternity) and the continued increase in\r\nthe number of younger doctors still further relieved Dr. Zakrzewska and\r\nenabled her in the summer of 1874 to go to Europe for a long-deferred\r\nbut much-needed vacation. The constantly growing demands in both\r\nHospital and private practice upon her professional skill, and in the\r\ncommunity at large upon the many gifts of her broad personality, became\r\nat last a breaking strain upon the vitality so grievously depleted by\r\nthe pioneer work of these first fifteen years in Boston.\r\n\r\nMidway in this resting time (August 19, 1874) she writes to Dr. Sewall:\r\n\r\n My vacation is half over, and just now I am enjoying a short stay in\r\n the queerest little old town and ditto hotel between the Bernese and\r\n Wallis Alps. Such a rest from work and care I have never had in all\r\n my life! My head is getting steady once more and, although I am not\r\n yet as quiet in my upper regions as I ought to be if I want again to\r\n work hard, I am certainly very, very much better than I was at the\r\n time I started from Boston. I have had only slight headaches, never\r\n sufficient to lie down, and I am much less confused, in spite of the\r\n three languages around me.\r\n\r\n We travel in a very leisurely way, different from tourists, for we\r\n stop and sojourn wherever the fancy happens to take us. In this way,\r\n we have seen a great deal of Switzerland, and have enjoyed the usual\r\n places of interest as well as the out-of-the-way places such as where\r\n we are now.\r\n\r\n I have so often thought of you and of what you are doing and have\r\n followed you in your summer’s work. I suppose just now you are away on\r\n your vacation. What I am most curious about is whether you succeeded\r\n in selling your present house, and whether you bought that nice one on\r\n Boylston Street. It would be such a beautiful situation that I wish I\r\n could find you settled there on my return.\r\n\r\n ... However beautiful all around me is here, I long for home and my\r\n friends. My home in Roxbury is, after all, the most desirable spot for\r\n me, and the few but true and kind friends I have made in America are\r\n far dearer to me than all I could possibly find here in Europe.\r\n\r\n After this journey, I shall be more positive in my love for my\r\n American home than I ever was before. The very freedom one breathes in\r\n the air there is refreshing and stimulating compared with the air of\r\n servility, destitution and depravity which an observing person sees\r\n everywhere here. How Americans can prefer to live over here is to me\r\n incomprehensible.\r\n\r\n ... Miss Sprague has hardly yet got over the effects of her\r\n seasickness, and in four and a half weeks we shall undertake the\r\n journey again. We hope to be in Boston by the 2d of October ready for\r\n work. Please tell Dr. Dimock of the very pleasant call I had from\r\n Professor Meyer and that he gave me his picture to bring home to her.\r\n I hope she is doing well and can wait for my help till October.\r\n\r\n I have little time for letter writing, as I am too tired to write at\r\n night and, besides, my eyes have given out. For the past few weeks, I\r\n can neither read nor thread a needle by candlelight, and often even by\r\n daylight everything is in a blur.\r\n\r\n But tell Dr. Dimock I am thinking a good deal about her and hope\r\n she will not work too hard, so that she can bear the winter’s\r\n responsibility and have her turn here in Europe next summer.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1875 as planned in this letter, Dr. Dimock who was\r\nacting as attending surgeon, in addition to her duties as resident and\r\nattending physician, obtained leave of absence and sailed for Europe\r\nto undertake additional surgical study, but she had the misfortune\r\nto be a passenger on the steamer _Schiller_ which was wrecked\r\non the Scilly rocks early in May. Her loss was felt keenly, not only\r\nbecause of the charm of her personality but also because she had been\r\na representative of the hopes of the Hospital for a woman who would be\r\nbroadly fitted and trained to serve as attending surgeon. The name of\r\nCodman Avenue, a street which ran through the hospital grounds, was\r\nlater in her memory changed to Dimock Street.\r\n\r\nLater in the year, Dr. C. Annette Buckel, newly returned from two years\r\nof study of surgery in Vienna and Paris, was regularly appointed as\r\nattending surgeon. This was an important event for both Dr. Zakrzewska\r\nand the New England Hospital because now for the first time since 1866\r\nan attending surgeon reappears in the annual report as a member of the\r\nstaff. And this event was especially noteworthy because for the first\r\ntime the name of such staff member was that of a woman.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Buckel did not retain her position beyond that first year\r\n(removing to California on account of ill health), yet her appointment\r\nseemed to end the surgical vicissitudes of the Hospital. Never since\r\nthen has there been a time when the position of attending surgeon has\r\nbeen omitted from the annual report. And never has there been lacking a\r\nqualified woman to carry on this work. Indeed, it soon became necessary\r\nto appoint a second attending surgeon, then a third, and then a fourth.\r\nAnd to these have been added from time to time one or more assistant\r\nsurgeons. And with this conquest of the surgical field was surmounted\r\nthe last difficulty in filling staff positions with qualified women.\r\n\r\nDr. Zakrzewska’s vacation in Europe had lasted only a few months,\r\nthough it should have been a year or even more. Recuperation from brain\r\nand nerve fatigue is much slower than from muscle fatigue, a lesson we\r\nall learn only by bitter experience. Her wonderful physique once more\r\ndrew upon its vital reserves and responded to the spur of her call to\r\nduty, and she returned to work with apparently renewed vigor.\r\n\r\nFortunate it was that she was able to resume the helm at the Hospital\r\nin this eventful year of 1875, following Dr. Dimock’s untimely loss and\r\nthe necessity which had arisen for Dr. Sewall’s taking a long vacation.\r\n\r\nFor eight months it must have seemed to her almost like a reversion to\r\nearlier days. But there was the incomparable difference that Dr. Helen\r\nMorton now took entire charge of the Maternity, having developed at\r\nthe Paris Maternité, according to Dr. Zakrzewska, “unusual skill and\r\nspecial fitness for difficult and surgical obstetric cases.” And later\r\nDr. Elizabeth C. Keller[19] came from Philadelphia to serve as resident\r\nphysician, she succeeding Dr. Buckel the following year as attending\r\nsurgeon and occupying this latter position for many years.\r\n\r\nWriting of this time to Dr. Sewall in Europe, Dr. Zakrzewska says:\r\n\r\n I think we shall all like Dr. Keller. And it is a very good thing to\r\n have a fresh and new element come into Boston, as we tend to renew\r\n ourselves too much from and through ourselves.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn the return of Dr. Sewall and the arrival of Dr. Keller\r\nonce more released Dr. Zakrzewska and permitted her to resume the wide\r\nrelations which she held outside the Hospital. She was constantly\r\ncalled upon to express her views on the questions regarding women,\r\nquestions which were more and more appealing to the increasing number\r\nof medical women as well as to the community at large. She responded to\r\nthese calls both in speech and in writing.\r\n\r\nRealizing how much the interior arrangements of the new buildings were\r\ndue to the advice and planning of the medical women, it was a great\r\nsatisfaction to her that in the following year (1876) at the Centennial\r\nInternational Exhibition held in Philadelphia, the plans and elevations\r\nof the new buildings of the Hospital, together with photographic\r\ninterior views of the wards, etc., were exhibited in the names of the\r\narchitects, Messrs. Cummings and Sears, and received an award for\r\n“well-studied design securing economy of service, good distribution of\r\nvarious parts for ventilation and cheerful accommodation.”\r\n\r\nAlso that at the Centennial, a history and description of the Hospital\r\nwas displayed in the Massachusetts Exhibit in the Department of\r\nEducation and Science, and in the Woman’s Department.\r\n\r\nIn 1877 Mrs. Cheney writes to her from Europe:\r\n\r\n All that I have seen and heard of the work of medical education\r\n for women in Europe has deepened my sense of the importance of our\r\n Hospital work. It is known in every circle that I have entered where\r\n there is any interest in woman’s progress, and in England and Scotland\r\n and Germany they look to us for encouragement and help.\r\n\r\nThere was a great improvement in the financial condition of the\r\nHospital during this year (1877); and among other items in the\r\ntreasurer’s report occurs the following which speaks for itself as\r\nan interesting commentary on the policy developed by Dr. Zakrzewska\r\nin the Hospital, as we have already seen it developed in her private\r\npractice:\r\n\r\n The executors of the late Mr. Augustus Hemenway devoted to us the\r\n liberal sum of fifteen thousand dollars from the sum left by his will\r\n to charities not promoting pauperism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n _Dr. Zakrzewska and the other pioneer medical women find a new foe\r\n in an increasing number of medical women who are poorly educated and\r\n otherwise unfitted--She addresses the New England Women’s Club on the\r\n “Medical Education of Women”--Unsuccessful attempt to persuade the\r\n New York medical colleges for men to accept scholarships for properly\r\n prepared women--Opening of the Woman’s Medical College of the New York\r\n Infirmary--Further movement to open for women one of the great medical\r\n colleges for men--Dr. Zakrzewska’s comment on this proposition,\r\n with special reference to Harvard--The New England Hospital Medical\r\n Society--Action taken by Harvard University in 1879 on the question of\r\n admitting women students of medicine. (1865-1880.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pioneer medical women (Drs. Elizabeth Blackwell, Marie E.\r\nZakrzewska, Emily Blackwell, and Ann Preston) to whose successful\r\nstruggles are due, for the first time in the history of the world, the\r\nreal opening of the profession of medicine to women equally with men,\r\nhad no sooner begun to take breath after their first stupendous battle,\r\nthan they found themselves confronted with a new foe.\r\n\r\nThis foe was within the ranks of their own sex, and its development\r\nthreatened an undermining campaign which seemed almost more\r\ndisheartening than the militant one from which they had just emerged.\r\nThis new foe was the increasing number of women doctors, poorly\r\neducated and otherwise unfitted, who began to appear all over the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nBecause the evil was so insidious and was cloaked by the necessity and\r\nthe desire for competent medical women which had been demonstrated and\r\naroused throughout the country, it was most difficult to meet.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia women met it by striving even harder to bring up the\r\nstandard of the Woman’s Medical College and to expand the field of the\r\nWoman’s Hospital.\r\n\r\nThe more eastern women, meaning those of New York and Boston at the\r\nNew York Infirmary and the New England Hospital, met it by trying to\r\nestablish a standard and by trying to educate both the profession and\r\nthe laity to accept nothing lower than such a standard.\r\n\r\nTo these women, the simplest as well as the wisest procedure seemed\r\nto be an attempt to persuade some of the best of the already existing\r\nmedical colleges to accept a number of properly prepared women students.\r\n\r\nTo this end, it was proposed to inform the community at large of the\r\nsituation (the subject being really as vital to the laity as to the\r\nprofession, since doctors can practice only through patients), and to\r\ncollect a large sum of money which might serve to endow a number of\r\nscholarships for women in some of the leading medical colleges of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1865, a fund of fifty thousand dollars had been collected\r\nfor this purpose, but all the colleges refused to accept women as\r\nstudents, even under such auspices. As the situation was particularly\r\npressing in New York, the Drs. Blackwell were then so urged to take the\r\nnext best step (the best having proved to be beyond their power) that\r\nthey consented to add a college to their Hospital. And thus, in 1868,\r\nwas opened the Woman’s Medical College of the New York Infirmary.\r\n\r\nThis college set a standard which was never surpassed by any of the\r\ncolleges for men. But one small college insisting on a high standard\r\ncould not compete numerically with rivals offering apparently equally\r\ndesirable advantages and with standards easier of attainment. So the\r\ncampaign continued!\r\n\r\nIn 1877, Dr. Zakrzewska being invited to address a body of leading\r\nnonmedical women (the _New England Women’s Club_), brought this\r\nproblem to them for conference. She said in part:\r\n\r\n At first the study of medicine appealed only to earnest women who felt\r\n a decided calling in that direction and who really thought to benefit\r\n their sex by acquiring information which would serve others through\r\n their advice. Very few, if any, of these first women combined with\r\n this idea that of vindicating their rights as Women.\r\n\r\n It was no easy matter at that time to become a doctor of medicine. The\r\n great obstacle, want of schools, sifted out the weaker elements; and\r\n those who succeeded in obtaining teachers and in being admitted into\r\n the colleges then open to women were, as you will conceive, possessed\r\n of unusual perseverance and firmness of purpose.\r\n\r\n But soon there appeared among the candidates for medical honors\r\n another purpose, the desire to gain these honors through simple study\r\n during a prescribed course without any laborious work.\r\n\r\n The first suggestion of this came through some men physicians who,\r\n becoming alarmed at the movement and perhaps conscious of their\r\n own mediocrity, felt instinctively that there was danger of their\r\n being overshadowed by women, who are by nature sympathetic and more\r\n caretaking in sickness.\r\n\r\n These raised the cry of “competition.” Many women believed the cry\r\n was caused by alarm at a real danger, that of the women making money\r\n of which the men desired to retain a monopoly, and they imagined\r\n that a new field especially adapted to their sex was opened--one in\r\n which, with a short course of technical study, they could more easily\r\n and rapidly than in other vocations open to them acquire a name and\r\n abundant means of support, if not a fortune.\r\n\r\n The laity then awoke to this movement, and that portion of them whose\r\n head and heart were interested in the “rights” of women began to\r\n establish schools and colleges for the purpose of educating women\r\n physicians. And in a short time such institutions sprang up in several\r\n cities.\r\n\r\n After years of struggle and gradual improvement, the Philadelphia\r\n medical school for women (Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania) has\r\n acquired deserved value when judged by the standard of men’s schools.\r\n\r\n And the Drs. Blackwell were later compelled to open a medical school\r\n in connection with the Infirmary (Woman’s Medical College of the New\r\n York Infirmary), in order to stem the flood of inferior physicians\r\n which was pouring forth, especially in New York, from schools which\r\n were far below mediocrity.\r\n\r\n Thus to-day, of all the institutions open to women for medical study,\r\n only these two and the University of Michigan even try to reach the\r\n standard of medical education necessary to compare favorably with that\r\n of the men.\r\n\r\n I say, _try_ to reach that standard. By this, I do not wish to\r\n imply that the teachers and professors in these schools are always\r\n less capable than those in the male schools. No, the fault is in the\r\n students themselves, and so it will be for some time to come. Here,\r\n allow me to state why this is so and has been so for many years.\r\n\r\n As I have said before, in the beginning of this movement women who\r\n persisted in the study needed uncommon perseverance and firmness of\r\n purpose. For the acquisition of these qualities, a certain amount\r\n of educational training and concentration of thought and will were\r\n requisite.\r\n\r\n At present, such uncommon perseverance and determination are not so\r\n indispensable. It is now very easy to become a physician. If the\r\n higher and better medical schools will not admit women, the lower and\r\n the less strict are willing to do so. Socially, the woman doctor is\r\n respected and in some circles even lionized and ranked far above the\r\n teacher; therefore, two great obstacles are removed.\r\n\r\n All that a young woman needs is the permission of her parents and the\r\n means of support while studying. Both of these are now more easily\r\n attained, since her social position is likely to improve rather than\r\n to decline as it formerly did.\r\n\r\n Also, the number of schools and colleges has increased and they\r\n require a certain number of students in order to exist. Hence arises\r\n a rivalry among these institutions, and instead of elevating their\r\n standard to make good women physicians some lower it in order to fill\r\n their classes.\r\n\r\n The effect of this sort of education is that the country is rapidly\r\n being swarmed with women physicians of very doubtful ability as\r\n regards either preparatory or medical education.\r\n\r\n At the same time, the need for well-educated women physicians becomes\r\n the more pressing, as is manifested by the ready employment they all\r\n find, though there is no chance for discrimination between the real\r\n and the sham article denoted by the sign “Doctor.”\r\n\r\n Hence, in many places the movement is beginning to be again viewed\r\n with distrust by communities which have again and again been\r\n disappointed when hoping to find scientific education and practical\r\n talent among the women practitioners who were offering their services\r\n to the public.\r\n\r\n In a word, the so hopefully sown good seeds are in danger of being\r\n suffocated by the still more thickly sown weeds.\r\n\r\n It is against this danger that I feel I must warn you. And I wish to\r\n call upon every educated woman within my reach to aid in destroying\r\n this evil.\r\n\r\n Every individual can assist in this great reform; first, by trying to\r\n get clear ideas on the subject in order to discriminate and to judge;\r\n and then, to assist in every possible way those who are striving to\r\n elevate the educational and moral standards in medicine.\r\n\r\n Some highly educated physicians have said to me, “We see no reason\r\n why a woman should not study medicine. If she can become wiser and\r\n her practice better, then we _must_ have her, for our aim is the\r\n _better_; if she cannot do this or cannot even do as well as men,\r\n she will work her own destruction in her endeavors.”\r\n\r\n Women should be willing to accept this or any other just test, but\r\n in order that the experiment shall be a fair one, they must have\r\n preparation and education and subsequent opportunity, equal to those\r\n given to the men.\r\n\r\nThe continued refusal of the larger medical colleges to admit women,\r\nunder endowed scholarships or in any other way, led to the development\r\nof a more ambitious plan, this being the idea of purchasing direct\r\npartnership rights for women in one of these colleges.\r\n\r\nBut this required the raising of a much larger amount of money. In\r\nthis direction there was made in 1880, a tentative proposition which\r\ninvolved the formation of a central organization with State branches,\r\nfor the purpose of collecting such large fund and then arranging for\r\nits wise use.\r\n\r\nThe statement was made:\r\n\r\n All sectional jealousy must be laid aside. Neither Boston, nor New\r\n York, nor Philadelphia must insist upon being the seat of the medical\r\n school. If Harvard would accept our conditions, it might possibly\r\n present certain guaranties which would give it a first claim in spite\r\n of the greater clinical advantages of the larger cities. But the\r\n College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, and the University of\r\n Pennsylvania and the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, must\r\n also be considered.\r\n\r\n In making the large united effort which seems desirable in order to\r\n take an advance step in the education of American medical women, we\r\n must secure that great impersonal enthusiasm for a cause which shall\r\n be far above purely sectional pride.\r\n\r\nWhen this proposition was submitted to Dr. Zakrzewska for\r\nconsideration, she replied as follows:\r\n\r\n In order to answer your letter of July 27 carefully, I must dictate it\r\n because an affliction of my eyes prevents me from writing myself. My\r\n health is pretty good, and the very best of oculists declare my eyes\r\n to be good, still the least use of them for reading or writing gives\r\n me so much pain that it prevents sleep and unfits me for thinking\r\n business.\r\n\r\n The proposed crusade against the mediocre medical colleges has been\r\n recognized as necessary, not only by myself but by all the physicians\r\n connected with the New England Hospital. Perhaps the fact that we are\r\n working independently of all colleges has given us a more impartial\r\n opinion in regard to these schools. We have, I think, the best chance\r\n to judge of the results which these schools produce because we receive\r\n the young graduates for the practical training.\r\n\r\n Perhaps you will remember that I wrote you four or five years ago\r\n how discouraged I felt about the manner in which the different\r\n female medical colleges educated and inspired their students and how\r\n derogatory the result was to the whole movement.\r\n\r\n ... The proposition to raise one hundred thousand dollars for the\r\n purpose of securing admission into a male college could be carried\r\n out quite easily, comparatively speaking. In Massachusetts alone,\r\n it could be done if Harvard would consent to add a small class of\r\n women to its medical department. The fact is that when a few years\r\n ago the New England Female Medical College here in Boston was broken\r\n up, there came unofficially from some one in authority in Harvard the\r\n proposition to take it, provided the public would endow it with one\r\n hundred thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n In such case, the female students would be educated in their own\r\n building which was two miles from the building for men. However, the\r\n examinations of the women students for entrance into the college\r\n were to be the same as those for the men, and the instruction was to\r\n be given by the same professors--in fact, Harvard Medical College\r\n repeated for the benefit of women alone.\r\n\r\n I did not favor such an arrangement but actually discouraged it,\r\n because it seemed to me disastrous to the whole spirit of woman’s work\r\n in the profession.\r\n\r\n I feared that after trial professors of acknowledged rank might\r\n declare that teaching six or twelve women was not satisfactory,\r\n although it might recompense them financially, and that therefore\r\n they would either give it up entirely or leave the instruction to the\r\n younger teachers.\r\n\r\n I could not advocate a school exposed to such a risk because if the\r\n instructors of Harvard Medical College should become more prominent\r\n in the woman’s branch while the professors took the lead in the men’s\r\n branch, it would give both the students and the public the impression\r\n that the women were of secondary importance.\r\n\r\n Another attempt to open Harvard to women has been made within a year\r\n or two by a lady who proposed to give ten thousand dollars towards a\r\n fund which would pay for a class of women in the medical department.\r\n\r\n Many discussions concerning this proposition came up in the different\r\n meetings which were held in consequence of this offer. The result\r\n was always the same, namely, divided opinions--entirely against the\r\n admission of women at all; against their admission with men; and\r\n against the formation of a small class of women alone.\r\n\r\n The only encouraging part of the discussion was that those who were\r\n entirely opposed to women’s studying were a very small minority, while\r\n those against coeducation were less firm in their opposition. Besides,\r\n I am perfectly sure that if the younger men who now hold positions as\r\n instructors at the College could cast their votes and could influence\r\n the Directors’ decisions, there would be more chance for the admission\r\n of women.\r\n\r\n The New England Female Medical College was absorbed into the Boston\r\n University Medical Department, an inferior school and a homeopathic\r\n one, which has no other merit than that it admits men and women on\r\n equal terms to all its advantages; therefore, it does not injure the\r\n movement for women any more than it does the profession at large.\r\n\r\n Our Hospital does as good a work as any hospital carried on by medical\r\n men. We have now two good women surgeons, and all kinds of operations\r\n are performed as a matter of course, without being considered\r\n extraordinary occurrences, as was formerly the case.\r\n\r\n I can safely say that the Hospital work, which we enlarge as fast as\r\n our means will permit, has become a power throughout the country, and\r\n the Hospital in all its appointments is more or less acknowledged as\r\n the most complete of any under the control of women physicians.\r\n\r\n This is as good a picture of the situation here in Boston as I am able\r\n to give you. If we had gained admission into the Massachusetts Medical\r\n Society, we would stand on equal footing with the best part of the\r\n profession.\r\n\r\n In some of the smaller towns of Massachusetts, young women physicians\r\n have been admitted into the county societies, and these being a part\r\n of the Massachusetts Medical Society have thus opened a discussion\r\n which will eventually lead to the admission of women into the parent\r\n society, which is another step towards getting admission into Harvard\r\n Medical Department.\r\n\r\n On October 1, Dr. Smith who was graduated in Zurich will take the\r\n position of resident physician with us, and we shall try to persuade\r\n other educated women to study in Zurich so that we can fill this post\r\n with such graduates and thus overcome little by little the opposition\r\n to coeducation.\r\n\r\n Can you not see from these statements that the raising of money alone\r\n will not suffice to bring about the equally good education of women\r\n and men? To be sure, if I had a sum large enough to endow a medical\r\n college, I could bring about coeducation and thorough scientific\r\n study by getting men of the best talent from both Europe and America,\r\n but one hundred thousand dollars would be only a drop in the bucket\r\n towards such an enterprise.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile, we have another bright prospect in the admission of women\r\n to the University of Michigan, at Ann Arbor. Although the medical\r\n students are not in the same classrooms, yet the lectures and the\r\n opportunities for women are precisely the same as those for men.\r\n\r\n The lectures are given in separate lecture rooms, except in chemistry.\r\n The students of both sexes work together in the laboratory and are\r\n present at most of the clinics. The work in the dissecting-rooms is\r\n quite separate, and occasionally the women are not present at some\r\n special operations.\r\n\r\n The movement for educating women as physicians has become so\r\n widespread that I think it impossible to work for the elevation of the\r\n standard of their medical education in any other way than by having\r\n the leading women of each state keep in view as their final aim the\r\n opening on the basis of coeducation of the best medical colleges.\r\n\r\n The number of persons now interested in the whole movement is so great\r\n and the labor to raise money to maintain the institutions, even such\r\n as they are, has required so much nerve and strength that even to hint\r\n at their abolition or their absorption in male colleges might have a\r\n detrimental effect in dispiriting the public who, taken as a whole,\r\n are not yet settled on the question of coeducation.\r\n\r\n The American people, both men and women, have to work out the\r\n different problems of advancing their interests without having them\r\n favored or opposed by a fixed social class whose prerogative it is to\r\n exercise a controlling influence on any standard set up.\r\n\r\n The medical education of women must now take its chance for growth\r\n like all the other questions of woman’s rights, yes, even of men’s\r\n rights, politically speaking. We are, with all the rest, passing\r\n through the phase of crystallization, and only the merit or the\r\n capacity of the individual can act to bring about a good and lasting\r\n effect.\r\n\r\n We must grow at present by every one of us doing her utmost best from\r\n day to day; and if the principle is a correct one that it is within\r\n women to exercise their faculties according to their inclinations the\r\n same as men do, it cannot be overthrown. I do not want to give you\r\n the impression that I wish to be pessimistically indolent; on the\r\n contrary, I want you to understand that I include in that “utmost\r\n best” criticism as well as denunciation of the imperfect or mediocre\r\n and readiness for any crusade for the better, for the higher, and for\r\n the perfect ideal.\r\n\r\n The physicians connected with our Hospital have formed a Society,[20]\r\n and have framed a constitution which admits to membership both men and\r\n women. So far we have only women members, and there are only a very\r\n few in the society who are not connected with the Hospital, because we\r\n mean to be as careful and as stringent as possible.\r\n\r\n I wish I could visit you this winter and talk all these matters over,\r\n as I really need a rest of a year, not because I am sick but because\r\n I feel that I may be, as the strain upon my nerve power has been so\r\n intense for thirty years that relaxation is needed if I want to end my\r\n life in usefulness.\r\n\r\n For the present, I cannot do anything more than to plan for such a\r\n recreation, but when the moment comes to carry out this plan, I shall\r\n write to you in order to make arrangements for us to meet in a way\r\n which will give us time and comfort.\r\n\r\nThe ten thousand dollars referred to in the above letter was offered\r\nin 1878 by Miss Marian Hovey toward the new building which Harvard was\r\nabout to erect, she making the condition that women should be admitted\r\nas students.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Chadwick, the Corporation referred the communication\r\nto the Board of Overseers who in turn referred it to a committee\r\nconsisting of President Eliot, Alexander Agassiz, Dr. Morrill Wyman, J.\r\nElliot Cabot and Dr. LeBaron Russell. In 1879, majority and minority\r\nreports were presented, the latter by Dr. Russell alone.\r\n\r\nThe majority report recommended acceptance of the trust offered by Miss\r\nHovey, and presented an outline of conditions which were thought to be\r\ndesirable to govern the admission of women students.\r\n\r\nIt further stated that of twenty-one members of the Medical Faculty who\r\nexpressed their views in writing, six were in favor, with restrictions;\r\nthree were in favor of making the experiment but had strong doubts\r\nof its expediency or success; five were opposed, but were willing\r\nto try the experiment under certain conditions; seven were strongly\r\nopposed. Thus, fourteen were at least willing to try the experiment\r\nconditionally, while seven were unconditionally opposed.\r\n\r\nThe minority report opposed acceptance of the trust and advised that\r\nthe medical women should establish their own school, modeling it upon\r\nthe Harvard school.\r\n\r\nA vote of the Board of Overseers was immediately taken upon the\r\nadoption of the majority report, the vote standing seven to nine. It\r\nwas then voted to reconsider the motion two weeks later.\r\n\r\nMeantime, a meeting of the Medical Faculty was held and the admission\r\nof women was negatived in _two_ resolutions, one by a vote of\r\nthirteen to five and one of fourteen to four.\r\n\r\nFollowing this action of the Medical Faculty, the Board of Overseers at\r\ntheir next meeting voted (17 to 7):\r\n\r\n That the Board of Overseers find themselves unable to advise the\r\n President and Fellows to accept the generous proposal of Miss Hovey.\r\n\r\nIt then voted (16 to 10) for the following motion which was proposed by\r\nthe President:\r\n\r\n That in the opinion of the Board of Overseers it is expedient that,\r\n under suitable restrictions, women be instructed by Harvard University\r\n in its Medical School.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n _Opening of the Massachusetts Medical Society to women--Letter on\r\n the subject to Dr. Zakrzewska from Dr. Henry I. Bowditch--She declines\r\n to present herself for examination for admission, having already\r\n twice prepared herself and been refused examination because she was\r\n a woman--Dr. Zakrzewska’s reply to the question “whether to enforce\r\n obedience medicines should be administered to refractory prisoners in\r\n reformatories and prisons.” (1879-1884.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this same year of 1879, however, that the cause was heartened\r\nby the beginning of the tardy capitulation of the Massachusetts Medical\r\nSociety, the council of which following in the wake of ten or a dozen\r\nof the other State medical societies, finally voted to admit women to\r\nmembership on equal terms with men.\r\n\r\nThis society differs from most of the other State medical societies\r\nin that its membership does not consist, as does theirs, of delegates\r\nfrom the constituent county societies. Members join the Massachusetts\r\nMedical Society as individuals, and it aims to include all reputable\r\nmembers of the profession.\r\n\r\nIt had previously refused to recognize homeopathic and eclectic\r\nphysicians, holding these latter as “irregular” practitioners of\r\nmedicine, even though their diplomas were legalized by the same\r\nauthority as that which had legalized those of its own members.\r\n\r\nIts refusal to admit women to membership showed its intention to\r\nclassify women also as “irregulars,” even women who had received their\r\ndiplomas as regular classmates of men who were acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, of October 9, 1879,\r\nexpressed itself characteristically in an editorial:\r\n\r\n We regret to be obliged to announce that at a meeting of the\r\n councilors, held on October 1, it was voted to admit women to the\r\n Massachusetts Medical Society.... Enshrouded in her mantle of science,\r\n woman is supposed to be endowed with power to descend from that high\r\n pedestal upon which we men have always placed her, and to mingle with\r\n us unscathed in scenes from which her own modesty and the esteem of\r\n the other sex has hitherto protected her.\r\n\r\nThe editor seems to have forgotten that women had long mingled in those\r\n“scenes” as patients and as nurses; it was only as physicians that they\r\nwere being “protected” from them.\r\n\r\nHowever, the “protectors” were loath to discontinue their gallant\r\nservices and, following the protest of the Suffolk District branch of\r\nthe State Society, the Council rescinded its vote, thus relegating the\r\nmedical women to their pedestals.\r\n\r\nBut the Society continued in a state of unrest, friends of the\r\nadmission of women gaining in strength and their opponents losing\r\nproportionately, though by-issues were also injected. Eventually, the\r\ninevitable was foreseen; the question remained only as to the form\r\nwhich it would take.\r\n\r\nThe handwriting on the wall was visible when in 1883 the Pennsylvania\r\nState Medical Society (!) sent a woman (Dr. Alice Bennett) as delegate\r\nto the annual meeting of the Massachusetts Medical Society. She was\r\naccepted officially, and she sat through the proceedings, and nothing\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the following year, 1884, the By-Laws were\r\namended so as to permit of the admission of women on an equality with\r\nmen; and then that storm center cleared.\r\n\r\nAn editorial in the _Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, June\r\n19, 1884, loyally accepts the action of the Society but it cannot\r\nforbear a little overflow of emotion in the following words:\r\n\r\n ... We believe that women in this particular community are already\r\n aided and abetted in too many foolish fads and fancies. There is too\r\n much bad piano playing and too little good cooking and sewing taught\r\n them....\r\n\r\n[Many years later, the editor of this book met the editor of the\r\n_Boston Medical and Surgical Journal_, and in discussing the\r\nsubject of medical women, she is glad to say he admitted that he had\r\n“readjusted” his “point of view.”]\r\n\r\nDr. Henry I. Bowditch viewed the action of the Society in a different\r\nlight, as is shown in a letter written to Dr. Zakrzewska after the\r\ndetails of this advanced step had been arranged and the women were\r\npreparing to take the Society examinations:\r\n\r\n  _Boston, June 15, 1884._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR DOCTOR:\r\n\r\n I thank you for the letter received yesterday. The result was entirely\r\n unexpected, and I can only thank God and take courage for the future\r\n days and for opportunities to fight for simple right and justice.\r\n\r\n For I assure you that all through these years since I have advocated\r\n the examination of women by the Massachusetts Medical Society, I\r\n have myself stood upon the eternal foundations of justice to every\r\n human being. My old anti-slavery warfare and its principles, with\r\n the experience gained in that fight against prejudice, have been of\r\n immense support to me.\r\n\r\n ... I have always consulted with honorable, educated women, in spite\r\n of all By-Laws. At first I believe some of the bigots thought I ought\r\n to be punished. But I cared not a farthing for the dark hints of\r\n discipline impending, feeling sure as I did that light would appear\r\n the next day and that with the element of Time and simple justice on\r\n my side, Right would certainly prevail.\r\n\r\n But as I now look back upon this final victory, and mark the various\r\n tyrannical rulings of our presidents and the stupid arguments urged\r\n by the opponents and their victories up to the present hour, with\r\n their final and, if not graceful, certainly good-natured and boorish\r\n submission to the fact of being in a hopeless minority themselves--I\r\n marvel, and, as I said above, take courage for any future fight for\r\n the True and Right.\r\n\r\n Some of the arguments by our opponents in the council were so weak\r\n that I think they injured their own cause.\r\n\r\n For example, Dr. ---- says: “Our fathers never meant that women should\r\n be members, and how absurd it would be for us to admit them! They\r\n are different from men and cannot properly become our associates in\r\n medicine, etc.”\r\n\r\n Dr. ----, with becoming pompousness of manner after duly twirling\r\n his gray mustaches, said: “I am not in favor of women being admitted\r\n because they have never done anything original.”\r\n\r\n Dr. Wyman suggested that the names of Mrs. Somerville, Mesdames Boivin\r\n and Lachapelle in France and Jacobi in America certainly proved that\r\n women were capable of high intellectual work.\r\n\r\n “_I_ do not admit that they are exceptions,” replied Dr. ----.\r\n\r\n I was fool enough to forget to ask what original work had ever been\r\n done by members of the Massachusetts Medical Society, and especially\r\n by the speaker himself. That would have floored our antagonist very\r\n effectually.\r\n\r\n But let us not think of the past, but prepare ourselves for the future\r\n that is opening so brightly before us.\r\n\r\n I am glad that the young students are preparing for the race. As for\r\n yourself, I do not wonder at your decision. You do as I think I should\r\n do.\r\n\r\n Your “pioneer” race and energy will always command the respect of the\r\n community and of the professional men who know you and who are not\r\n bigots to a “Code.”\r\n\r\n  I remain\r\n  Very truly yours,\r\n  HENRY I. BOWDITCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reference at the end of Dr. Bowditch’s letter is to the course upon\r\nwhich Dr. Zakrzewska had decided, after mature consideration of the\r\nquestion of taking the examination for admission to the Massachusetts\r\nMedical Society. She expresses this decision and the reasons for\r\nreaching it, as follows:\r\n\r\n The Massachusetts Medical Society has within the last three months\r\n decided to admit women. The perseverance of women in the practice of\r\n medicine and surgery, their professional competency, the increase in\r\n their numbers, and the impossibility of ignoring them any longer,\r\n have led to the result that physicians of this Society acknowledge\r\n women in daily practice and have thus broken the rule which binds them\r\n to friendliness and coöperation with members only. Necessity, not\r\n acknowledgment of the principle of the right of woman to practice, has\r\n finally conquered, and the Massachusetts Medical Society is willing\r\n to allow women to present themselves for examination with the view of\r\n admission.\r\n\r\n On the other hand, the regular women practitioners have found it\r\n necessary to protect themselves against being confounded with\r\n charlatans of every description, and have formed themselves into a\r\n society which adopts the name of the Hospital in which their practice\r\n started and now centers.\r\n\r\n Besides the physicians living in Boston, a few scattered over the New\r\n England States are members of this society. Thus a union of reliable\r\n women practitioners is begun and promises to be of interest and\r\n usefulness. If a union with the Massachusetts Medical Society can be\r\n effected by them, it would be beneficial to both and, no doubt, to the\r\n profession at large.\r\n\r\n The obstacles to such a union consist chiefly in the fact that any one\r\n wishing to become a member of the Massachusetts Medical Society has to\r\n present himself or herself for examination before a number of censors\r\n chosen by the Society, and at present in the Suffolk District Medical\r\n Society consisting of five of its youngest members, who have to\r\n examine the candidate in Obstetrics, Histology, Anatomy, Physiology,\r\n Pathology, Materia Medica, and Chemistry, that is to say, precisely in\r\n those branches for proficiency in which the candidate has received a\r\n diploma years ago.\r\n\r\n It is well known that wisdom and experience acquired in practice push\r\n into the background textbook knowledge, and that most physicians after\r\n ten years of practicing life have gained a great deal of knowledge\r\n which is not in the textbooks and have forgotten a great deal which is.\r\n\r\n It is therefore a question whether the amount of benefit gained by\r\n admission into the Massachusetts Medical Society is worth the waste of\r\n time necessary for reading and studying books which we have long laid\r\n aside and simply use occasionally for reference.\r\n\r\n To young beginners, I would advise the seeking of this privilege but\r\n as for myself, I feel constrained to make the following statement:\r\n\r\n When I came to Boston in 1859, eight years after my graduation in\r\n Berlin as _accoucheuse_ and three years after graduation as\r\n physician from the Western Reserve Medical College of Cleveland, Ohio,\r\n and having been regularly employed in teaching classes and private\r\n pupils in medicine, consequently, in the full life of a student--I\r\n made application for examination to be admitted into this society and\r\n was refused.\r\n\r\n Again, five years later, that is, in 1864, I made the same\r\n application, and was not so decidedly refused. Thinking there was a\r\n possibility of my being admitted, I set myself to work reviewing some\r\n of my studies in order to prepare myself to meet the high dignitaries\r\n in the shape of the young men members and censors of that venerable\r\n society; but after several months of discussion, I again received a\r\n refusal.\r\n\r\n This last refusal I met with the declaration that “when the time comes\r\n for women to be received into this Society--and I know it will come\r\n before I have passed out of this existence--this venerable Society\r\n cannot have me as a candidate for examination but must give me an\r\n honorary membership if it wants me at all.”\r\n\r\n To-day, its condescending proposal for my examination for admission\r\n has been made, and I am only a little more than fifty years old. But\r\n after twenty-six and one-half years of practice (that is, nearly\r\n at the end of my career), my only personal interest in this affair\r\n is that I am happy that the younger women can have the benefit of\r\n an association which is very desirable for all beginners, and most\r\n desirable in assisting women to gain the position for which they\r\n strive.\r\n\r\n I have done my part, and I feel satisfied with the results achieved. I\r\n have aided the women of this country by word and deed, by example and\r\n sacrifice, and I am willing to retire, leaving them the field in which\r\n to sow and to reap where I have helped to plow, associated as I have\r\n been with the pioneer women of the medical profession.\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that, at one of the meetings of the New\r\nEngland Hospital Society, that body was asked to give an opinion upon\r\na question which had arisen in reformatories and prisons, that is,\r\n“whether medicines which cause anesthesia, emesis or prostration should\r\never be administered to refractory prisoners to enforce obedience\r\nthrough their action.”\r\n\r\nA unanimous “No” expressed the instinctive feeling among all members\r\npresent of the absolute wrong in the use of such remedies to compel\r\nobedience. The discussion of this subject was continued to a subsequent\r\nmeeting, and Dr. Zakrzewska was requested to prepare a written\r\nstatement of her views upon this point. She writes:\r\n\r\n I. From the medical standpoint, the administering of a pharmaceutical\r\n preparation for any other purpose than to aid in the restoration of\r\n health is malpractice. An emetic or an opiate might be easily given to\r\n a culprit who is in perfect health but who refuses obedience to the\r\n prison regulations; this could be done by deceiving the offender. But\r\n the administration of ether or chloroform would meet with opposition\r\n for the overcoming of which an application of force would be needed,\r\n which would be as much in the nature of corporal punishment as would\r\n the use of the rod.\r\n\r\n No physician could sanction the use of remedies for any other than\r\n their legitimate purpose and must refuse such demand from the prison\r\n superintendent or warden.\r\n\r\n II. From the legal standpoint, no prison official has a right to order\r\n for the purpose of enforcing obedience the administration of powerful\r\n medicines to a healthy individual, thus rendering her ill for hours or\r\n days, shocking a system otherwise in harmonious action, and thereby\r\n also possibly producing bodily injuries, internally or externally,\r\n which may after the release of the prisoner easily lead to a\r\n complaint in a court of law, a complaint which could well be sustained.\r\n\r\n III. From the moral standpoint, the deception which is necessary\r\n either by disguising the medicine in some usual beverage or by false\r\n statement, pretending a necessity for some medical remedy, such as\r\n hypodermic injection of morphine, would at once awaken distrust of the\r\n whole official management and would thereby destroy the very principle\r\n upon which all prisons should be conducted, that is, the reformation\r\n of those intrusted to their care.\r\n\r\n If we once admit that medical remedies can be used by the physician\r\n under the orders of the superintendent in order to enforce obedience\r\n or as punishment, where shall we stop? The physician and the\r\n superintendent can become in time accomplices in such practices as may\r\n lead to even fatal results, for such officials have almost absolute\r\n power in these institutions which are subjected to only occasional\r\n examinations by State committees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n _Association for the Advancement of the Medical Education of\r\n Women--Coeducation or segregation--Dr. Zakrzewska leads another\r\n attempt to persuade Harvard to admit women to its Medical School\r\n (1881-1882)--Failure takes from Harvard final opportunity to be first\r\n great medical school to admit women on equal terms with men, this\r\n honor passing to the Johns Hopkins in 1890--Massachusetts Legislature\r\n directs that a woman physician be appointed in each State Hospital for\r\n insane patients--Dr. Zakrzewska takes a vacation in Europe--Letter to\r\n Mrs. Cheney and others--The New England Hospital requires all resident\r\n students to possess the degree of M.D., and changes their status to\r\n that of internes--The Hospital establishes District Nursing in its\r\n out-practice--Letter from Dr. Zakrzewska to Dr. Sewall who is on\r\n vacation in Europe--Dr. Zakrzewska compares earlier and later women\r\n medical students. (1879-1886.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a further move in the campaign for opening the larger colleges\r\nto women, there was formed the Association for the Advancement of\r\nthe Medical Education of Women. This association had a membership of\r\nmedical and lay men and women from different parts of the country, and\r\nDr. Mary Putnam-Jacobi was its president for many years.\r\n\r\nMary Putnam, one of the earlier students of the New England Hospital,\r\nand a graduate of the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania, was the\r\nfirst woman to be admitted to the _École de Médicine_ of the\r\nUniversity of Paris, from which she was graduated in 1871. Later, she\r\nmarried the noted Dr. Abraham Jacobi of New York, becoming herself one\r\nof the most brilliant members of the profession in America. It will be\r\nremembered that in 1876 she was awarded the Boylston Prize of Harvard\r\nUniversity, the identity, and consequently the sex, of the competitors\r\nfor this honor remaining unknown to the judges until after the verdict\r\nwas rendered.\r\n\r\nThe above association not only carried on an educational campaign, but\r\nfor several years it assisted the Woman’s Medical College of the New\r\nYork Infirmary by paying part of the faculty’s salaries and by helping\r\nto enlarge the College and the Hospital.\r\n\r\nAlthough continuing the support of such separate women’s colleges as\r\nmaintained their high standards, the leading medical women and the\r\nwell-informed men and women of the laity still realized that these were\r\n(and in the nature of things, must be) only the lamps which are kept\r\ntrimmed and burning as additional guaranties that the sacred fire shall\r\nnever be extinguished.\r\n\r\nThe main temples and the central fires are found in the large medical\r\nschools which were then monopolized by men, and the struggle must\r\ncontinue till these temples and fires are acknowledged to be human\r\npossessions, and hence open to women equally with men. Only then will\r\nit be possible to maintain the high standards to which both men and\r\nwomen physicians should be held, and which are required for the safety\r\nof the communities in which they practice.\r\n\r\nHence the persistence in seeking entrance to the men’s colleges. Not\r\nbecause they are colleges of men, no, but because this is still so\r\nlargely a man’s world, with men so often holding possession of the Best.\r\n\r\nAnd it is the Best in their chosen profession that medical women have\r\nalways been seeking--the best teaching; the best laboratories; the best\r\nlibraries; the best facilities for training all their faculties; the\r\nbest clinical opportunities; the best hospital advantages.\r\n\r\nAside from valid reasons for not segregating women students and\r\nphysicians as a separate group, all the conditions enumerated above\r\nhave an economic basis. They require money as well as scholarship--and\r\nscholarship itself requires money or it will starve--and no community\r\ncan afford to duplicate the expensive plants required for proper\r\nmedical education, so as to have twin institutions in which medical men\r\nand medical women shall be separated.\r\n\r\nThe answer and the advice always given by the men who happen to be\r\nin possession of these legacies of the ages and of the race--for the\r\ngreat medical schools owe their continued existence to the money and\r\nthe help of the women as well as of the men who have gone before--has\r\nalways been, “No, we cannot let you enter our colleges. Build your own\r\ncolleges!”\r\n\r\nIt is as though the great universities of the country should decline to\r\nadmit any but their local students, telling all others to build their\r\nown universities. Do Harvard and Yale Universities refuse students\r\noutside of Cambridge and New Haven, or even outside of Massachusetts\r\nand Connecticut, saying, “No, you cannot enter here. Build Harvards\r\nand Yales for yourselves!”\r\n\r\nIllogical as has been this advice, women have been driven by\r\ndesperation to attempt to follow it for both academic and professional\r\nstudies. A certain measure of success has been attained in the academic\r\ninstitutions, owing to the large number of women desiring education\r\nof the kind there given. In the field of medicine, as well as in that\r\nof the other technical professions, the situation is far different.\r\nThe number of women desiring such education is small when compared\r\nwith the number of those desiring academic education and, as has been\r\nwell-established, the expense for properly equipping professional\r\nschools is much greater proportionately as the number of students is\r\nsmaller.\r\n\r\nSo, in 1881, another attempt was made toward persuading Harvard to\r\nadmit women to its medical department. The New England Hospital\r\nMedical Society, through a committee of which Dr. Emma L. Call was\r\nchairman, had asked the assistance of the leading medical colleges for\r\nwomen toward making a combined appeal for the opening to women of the\r\nmedical school of Harvard University. And in September, the following\r\ncommunication was formally presented:\r\n\r\n To the President and Overseers of Harvard University:\r\n\r\n  GENTLEMEN:\r\n\r\n Would you accept the sum of fifty thousand dollars for the purpose of\r\n providing such medical education for women as will entitle them to the\r\n degree of Doctor of Medicine from your University?\r\n\r\n This sum to be held by you in trust, and the interest of the same to\r\n be added to the principal, until the income of the fund can be used\r\n for such medical education of women.\r\n\r\n If such an arrangement cannot be made within ten years, the fund to be\r\n returned to the donors.\r\n\r\nThis letter was signed by Drs. Zakrzewska, Emily Blackwell, Lucy\r\nE. Sewall, Helen Morton, Mary Putnam-Jacobi, Elizabeth M. Cushier,\r\nAlice Bennett, and Eliza M. Mosher--the Woman’s Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania feeling unable to join, but writing:\r\n\r\n ... While we are in hearty sympathy with the object of your efforts,\r\n it seems impracticable at present to offer any active coöperation.\r\n\r\nAfter a delay of several months, the following reply was received from\r\nHarvard University:\r\n\r\n  Treasurer’s Office, Harvard College,\r\n  No. 70 Water Street, Boston, May 2, 1882.\r\n\r\n  DEAR MADAM:\r\n\r\n I have the honor to enclose a copy of a vote recently passed by the\r\n President and Fellows of Harvard College, in relation to the Medical\r\n Education of Women in Harvard University.\r\n\r\n  Yours very respectfully,\r\n  E. W. HOOPER, Secy.\r\n\r\n  Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n (COPY)\r\n\r\n At a meeting of the President and Fellows of Harvard College in\r\n Boston, April 24, 1882.\r\n\r\n Upon the question of accepting the proposal contained in the\r\n communication received by this Board on September 26, 1881, from Marie\r\n E. Zakrzewska, M.D., and others, in relation to the medical education\r\n of women in Harvard University.\r\n\r\n Voted, that while the President and Fellows of Harvard College\r\n recognize the importance of thorough medical education for women they\r\n do not find themselves able to accept the proposal contained in the\r\n communication above referred to.\r\n\r\n  A true copy of Record\r\n  Attest: E. W. Hooper, Secy.\r\n\r\n  To Marie E. Zakrzewska, M.D.,\r\n  for herself and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus did Harvard lose its last opportunity to become the leader in\r\nthe opening to women of the great medical schools of America, its\r\nmisfortune in this respect being due to what appears to have been a\r\ncertain indecisiveness.\r\n\r\nIt showed the perception and the conviction of the justice of the\r\nwomen’s claim as early as 1850, or even 1847 (away back when Oliver\r\nWendell Holmes was dean of the medical school), and it seems to have\r\nhad, then and afterwards (1879), the desire for performance but it\r\nappears to have failed in resolution, and so it was at the mercy of\r\nminor cross-purposes.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the result of its vacillation was that eight years later\r\nthe honor was taken by the Johns Hopkins University of Baltimore.\r\n\r\nMeantime, Dr. Zakrzewska had in 1881 spent another vacation in Europe,\r\nand this time she particularly inquired into the progress of medical\r\nwomen in England. On May 28, she writes:\r\n\r\n  DEAR FRIENDS:\r\n\r\n I shall mail this letter eventually to Mrs. Cheney, but I intend it to\r\n be of the same interest to Miss Lucy Goddard and Miss Peabody.\r\n\r\n After a very rough passage, we arrived in London on the 17th of May\r\n at 4 A. M. My companions desired to begin sight-seeing at once and\r\n so, as is customary, we proceeded to Westminster Abbey. You all know\r\n how little appreciation I have for Fame; but whenever I go to places\r\n like this Abbey, Fame presents to me another aspect. It is entirely\r\n impersonal--names are of no consequence, but the reasons why these\r\n landmarks of civilization are placed there for the beholder are of\r\n intense interest.\r\n\r\n You all know that every shade of greatness is here represented in the\r\n monuments to men. There are some to women also, but only because these\r\n women happened to be queens or wives of royalty, though a few have\r\n been erected to high-stationed philanthropists. In no other capacity\r\n could I discover the name of a woman.\r\n\r\n Query: Before long, will there be erected a monument to a woman\r\n physician? We find the names of men physicians here, for no other\r\n reason than that they were eminent in their profession. Will there\r\n ever be a monument to the first woman physician because she was the\r\n leader of the movement; because she had the energy, will and talent,\r\n as well as the education, which would make her worthy of imitation;\r\n and because she is a landmark of the era marked by women’s freeing\r\n themselves from the bondage of prejudice and from the belief that they\r\n are the lower being when compared with men?\r\n\r\n These are the speculations which follow me wherever I go and wherever\r\n I find the monumental display to and for talent. I did not find Mrs.\r\n Somerville’s name on even a tablet in the Abbey. Why is it that women\r\n do not start a movement for placing one there and in other significant\r\n places?\r\n\r\n We need such landmarks of civilization not because those who died\r\n have lived for fame, no, but because the now-living, as well as\r\n those who will live long afterward, need encouragement for utilizing\r\n their capabilities, and monuments of this sort suggest to them the\r\n possibility of their so doing. The person who is covered by a monument\r\n is of no consequence, but the fact that a “woman” can work and make\r\n an impression upon civilization needs to be made known and to be\r\n remembered.\r\n\r\n Apropos, the word “woman” reminds me of the custom of speaking here in\r\n London. I have not heard a single time the word “lady” used as we use\r\n it in America. The Queen is spoken of as “a good woman,” the Princess\r\n Louise as “a sickly woman,” Mrs. Somerville as “an eminent woman,”\r\n the Duchess of Blank as “a fashionable woman.” Nowhere do we hear a\r\n dressed-up cook or chambermaid mentioned in the streets as “that lady\r\n there,” but as “the woman in the velvet gown,” etc. I wish some of our\r\n prominent women in America would make a crusade against the habit of\r\n applying the word “lady” to every woman under every condition.\r\n\r\n But now I must speak to you of what interests us most of all, namely,\r\n the work of the medical women in London. There is no doubt but that\r\n the position here of the woman physician is, professionally and\r\n legally, a far better one than with us in the United States. By the\r\n indomitable will and energy of Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake, the women who\r\n study medicine have been placed fundamentally on the same level with\r\n men. The method of study, theoretical and practical, is precisely that\r\n of the men.\r\n\r\n And although the Royal Free Hospital has only one hundred and fifty\r\n beds for the medical school of women, while the medical school for men\r\n of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital has six hundred and that of St. Thomas’\r\n Hospital has one thousand, five hundred, that makes no difference\r\n in the mode of study nor in the amount of knowledge which the woman\r\n student can acquire. One reason is that the number of women is only\r\n about forty while at either of the other hospitals, the number of men\r\n runs as high as seven hundred. Besides, I am told that women are more\r\n ready to gain knowledge through dispensary practice, which is entirely\r\n outside of the hospitals.\r\n\r\n There is, however, one branch which is very much neglected, both\r\n theoretically and in clinical instruction, Dr. Charles Drysdale being\r\n my authority for the statement that this neglect is just as great in\r\n the men’s course, namely, the instruction in higher midwifery and\r\n obstetrics as taught in France and Germany. He assures me that if\r\n there are English men of eminence in this branch, they have laid the\r\n foundation by going to Germany to study. Alas, these opportunities are\r\n not open as freely to English medical women.\r\n\r\n Dr. Drysdale, as well as some of the most prominent women\r\n practitioners here, expressed the wish that Boston or some other large\r\n city in the United States which has a hospital for women would so\r\n develop this particular branch as to induce the educated medical women\r\n of England to go thither in order to perfect themselves therein. The\r\n opinion of those who express such a wish is that money would gladly\r\n be paid to its full value for such opportunity for study.\r\n\r\n Such an opening for the English student would react very beneficially\r\n upon our American medical student, for there is no doubt but that the\r\n English medical women and students have in every respect a higher\r\n average education than we have. And the standards of education and\r\n civilization can best be raised through international intercourse.\r\n\r\n We now have in Boston decidedly good women surgeons and the beginning\r\n of a good department in surgery. This is of momentous importance for\r\n the reason that surgical work tells best both in the profession and\r\n among the laity. We also have in Boston excellent women obstetricians\r\n who do a great deal of obstetric surgery, but who give instruction to\r\n only the few privileged students of our Hospital.\r\n\r\n This branch could easily be enlarged and developed by our Hospital\r\n Staff if through larger means, greater opportunity for practice could\r\n be afforded them, and thus make it worth her while for the attending\r\n physician to give more thorough instruction both to our own students\r\n and to students from abroad. By saying making it worth her while, I\r\n mean allowing her compensation for time and labor.\r\n\r\n On the whole, we must begin to think of compensating our staff of\r\n women physicians. Now that the woman physician is an accepted fact\r\n in America, it becomes our duty to compensate those who have spent\r\n time and money in study (and especially those who have gone to the\r\n continent of Europe) for the labor which they expend upon the students\r\n not able to follow such a course.\r\n\r\n After introducing the woman into society as a physician, we must\r\n now take the next step, namely, see that those who follow are\r\n well-educated; and, therefore, we must utilize the knowledge of the\r\n former by giving her the chance to spread it among the new disciples.\r\n In other words, every physician with a good education who comes to us\r\n must be well paid, so that her time and strength will belong to our\r\n patients and to the students of the Hospital. And if other students\r\n who are not inmates of the Hospital wish to avail themselves of our\r\n instruction, they must be made to pay for it, whether this instruction\r\n be given by the resident physician or by one of the attending\r\n physicians.\r\n\r\n This has been my view for some years, and I am now very much confirmed\r\n in it through talk with the friends of medical education here, where\r\n I see most clearly that work without money value set upon it is not\r\n expected nor is it considered to be of the first class.\r\n\r\n The students here pay £80 for the theoretical instruction and £40\r\n for the hospital instruction, besides paying for their board outside\r\n of school and hospital, for they do not reside in either. Our\r\n institutions in the United States would not permit such a rate, nor do\r\n I wish to suggest it, but I wish that the friends of the movement for\r\n the medical education of women would come forward, as have those here\r\n in England, and provide us with means so that we can afford to pay an\r\n ample salary to our physicians, or at least to our resident physician,\r\n and thus secure her services for some years to come for the benefit of\r\n all concerned.\r\n\r\n The English generosity in this respect seems marvelous to me. For\r\n instance, the Royal Free Hospital would not connect the medical school\r\n for women with its work, saying that it had not room for them. The\r\n governors of the hospital were asked how much money was needed, and\r\n the enormous sum of £5,000 was set for a limited number of years,\r\n namely, five. At the expiration of this time, a similar sum, or even\r\n more, or perhaps nothing at all, might be needed. In a very short time\r\n the sum was raised, the money being used to build another wing to give\r\n room to the women for study.\r\n\r\n Out of the funds of the school, towards which the student contributes\r\n £40 for three years’ study, a large sum is paid to the physician who\r\n gives the instruction in this hospital. The funds of the school are\r\n raised by private subscription, and the fees charged to the students,\r\n although high, do not suffice to pay for the instruction given. In so\r\n far as the fees do not suffice, the situation is similar to that in\r\n our American colleges and schools; it differs in that the instructors\r\n are fully paid for the time and knowledge given to the students.\r\n The result is a higher education in medicine and a higher grade of\r\n individual physician than in the United States.\r\n\r\n In the two branches, surgery and the medical treatment of general\r\n diseases, the woman student has now in London ample opportunity.\r\n Plenty of material is provided, not only by the Royal Free Hospital\r\n but also by the New Hospital for Women, as well as by the dispensary\r\n attached to the latter. The latter hospital is carried on precisely\r\n as is our New England Hospital for Women and Children except that it\r\n has no maternity department. It admits patients for as little as four\r\n shillings a week but only a few are entirely free.\r\n\r\n The attending physicians are all married women of high social\r\n position, mothers and housekeepers and quite rich. It is thought by\r\n the English women that these prominent women should work in order to\r\n live down the prejudice, which seems to be very strong, that if women\r\n study or do anything they will cease to be willing to become mothers\r\n and housekeepers. This explained why in the medical school the “Mrs.”\r\n was always introduced to me before the “Miss” was spoken of.\r\n\r\n I think this is all I have to communicate to you about the work which\r\n lies so near to our hearts, and as my London visit closes to-morrow I\r\n think I shall have nothing more to add, but shall see what the women\r\n in Germany are doing.\r\n\r\n But I may tell you that I attended a small, public, woman suffrage\r\n meeting held to consider Mr. Hugh Mason’s proposition in the House\r\n of Commons to give the franchise to women. The meeting was a rather\r\n select one. The audience was admitted only by cards, which, to be\r\n sure, any one could procure beforehand, but which forms more or less\r\n of a hindrance to attendance.\r\n\r\n The speakers were all women and in favor of the measure. They were\r\n seven in number and each spoke for about ten minutes. They were\r\n fluent, eloquent, concise and modest. Their dignity was superb. There\r\n was a great deal of applause, and happiness over what had been gained\r\n was expressed in many a face. But the whole affair lacked vitality,\r\n enthusiasm, and breadth of feeling and fellowship. And, compared with\r\n even our smallest meetings, no matter whether held by women alone or\r\n by both men and women, it made me homesick for Boston--for America!\r\n\r\n Should you see any of our Doctors (for instance, Dr. Morton), ask\r\n them whether they care to read this epistle. Perhaps Dr. Smith will\r\n decipher it and read it at one of their meetings. But let Miss G. have\r\n it first, and tell me in a few words what you think of it, and how you\r\n are doing and whether your health and that of our friends is good and\r\n strong and ready to carry our work a little farther on.\r\n\r\n I am getting rested, and while my two companions are going sightseeing\r\n I am writing this. If you want to recommend our lodgings here, do so.\r\n They are in every respect desirable and recommendable. Be sure to\r\n give my love to all inquiring friends--Miss Farnham, Miss Cary, Mrs.\r\n Boardman, and a number of others whom I have no more paper to mention.\r\n\r\n  Faithfully yours,\r\n  M. E. ZAKRZEWSKA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1880-1881, the New England Hospital took the important step of\r\nrequiring all resident students to be the possessors of the degree of\r\nM.D., and of changing their status to that of _internes_.\r\n\r\nIn 1881, plans were made for having a nurse always on duty at the\r\nDispensary to respond to calls in the out-practice, but these plans did\r\nnot materialize until 1883, the New England Hospital thereby becoming\r\nthe leader in establishing the service of District Nursing. This form\r\nof service has since additionally expanded, under other auspices, into\r\nan organization which on a large scale renders valuable assistance to\r\npatients at their homes.\r\n\r\nThe year 1884 was marked by the setting up of another milestone along\r\nthe upward path of the medical woman, this being that the Massachusetts\r\nLegislature not only permitted but directed the appointment of medical\r\nwomen in the State Hospitals for insane patients.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1886, Dr. Zakrzewska writes to Dr. Sewall, who was then in\r\nEurope:\r\n\r\n ... In ten weeks from to-day, I shall start on my Western tour, and I\r\n suppose you will start by that time for the United States.\r\n\r\n My health is very good. I am better than I have been for thirty years\r\n and a great deal better than when I went to Europe five years ago.\r\n Nevertheless, I look forward to a five months’ vacation with a great\r\n deal of pleasure and feel sure that it will add years of health to my\r\n life.\r\n\r\n The Hospital work goes on well. I suppose Dr. Call informs you of the\r\n different legacies we have received. Even if they are not yet handed\r\n over to the treasurer, we can now be sure of the solidity of the\r\n institution as far as money is concerned.\r\n\r\n Now comes the professional standard and the question as to whether in\r\n the course of time women as physicians will prove themselves to be\r\n organizers and creators or simply handmaids. So far we cannot boast of\r\n much originality among our corps of women. However, we can feel sure\r\n that all the women physicians of the Hospital are above the average of\r\n the men physicians. Genius, after all, is rare.\r\n\r\n Apropos of sister Rosalie. It occurred to me that you with your usual\r\n generosity might think of her and bring with you some present for her.\r\n Now I honestly beg of you not to do any such thing, because the poor\r\n thing is sick and tired of all the bric-a-brac and vases which she has\r\n received, in spite of our not sending out invitations.\r\n\r\n Last Sunday morning when I called, she showed me a whole closet full\r\n of stuff which she had packed away in the attic because it is beyond\r\n human thought and possibility to place these things and take care of\r\n them in her little house. When I told her in consolation that she\r\n might use these things as presents again in the course of time, she\r\n replied in her usual way, “No, I shall never inflict them on people.\r\n If I make presents, I shall give flatirons.”\r\n\r\n My nephew Herman is engaged to be married to a young German-American\r\n lady who visited me for a week. She is handsome, an accomplished\r\n singer and pianist, a good housekeeper, and a sensible woman. We are\r\n very happy about his choice and feel grateful to her that she selected\r\n him.\r\n\r\n On the 22d at twelve o’clock, I shall give a great lunch party to\r\n the students and doctors. About fifty people will come, I hope. The\r\n snowdrops in Washington Street are in bloom since the 9th.\r\n\r\nIn line with her questioning in this letter of the achievements of\r\nmedical women of the then present date, is her estimate of the quality\r\nof the women students of the later times as compared with those of the\r\nearlier days. She writes:\r\n\r\n I am frequently asked whether the quality of medical students among\r\n women is not much better now than formerly. This question is a\r\n very subtle one to reply to justly. There is no doubt but that the\r\n educational standard among all youths, female and male, has been\r\n greatly raised; that accomplishments are not so universally considered\r\n all the education that girls need; that the increase of colleges for\r\n women alone, as well as the coeducational institutions, has promoted\r\n a thoroughness of training which was unknown fifty years ago in the\r\n schooling of young girls; and that all these advantages have promoted\r\n thought and earnestness of purpose in deciding upon a profession.\r\n\r\n But that the student of either sex is in consequence of this education\r\n of a better quality and promising more marked ability, especially in\r\n the medical profession, by no means follows.\r\n\r\n In the early decade of this movement, the woman who entered upon\r\n professional study had to possess qualities which no school, college\r\n or university can bestow. Originality, perseverance, persistency,\r\n self-abnegation, industry in study, and a certain amount of practical\r\n knowledge, as well as perception of human nature and social\r\n conditions, were absolutely necessary for each and every woman student\r\n in order to succeed even in going through the medical colleges then at\r\n their disposal, to say nothing of later attempts to enter into general\r\n practice.\r\n\r\n The help then offered by professional men was not based at all upon\r\n the principle of right nor on the suitability of the woman to become\r\n a physician. No, it was offered only by such men as stood head and\r\n shoulders above their colleagues in the professions. They were men who\r\n could afford to make enemies in and out of professional circles and\r\n who could afford to be pleased with a talented “exceptional woman”;\r\n intellectually to pet her, as it were; to teach her; to indulge her;\r\n yes, to speak in high terms of her and compare her with historic women\r\n of the past, feeling even proud that they had discovered such an\r\n exception to womankind.\r\n\r\n They seemed entirely unaware that the woman student perceived their\r\n delusions but nurtured in the depth of her heart the conviction,\r\n “What I am able to do now, hundreds, yes, thousands, will be able\r\n to accomplish after me.” Meanwhile, the women were grateful for all\r\n favors, advantages and teachings, utilizing them but industriously\r\n aiming higher and higher so as to gain all that could be gained\r\n through the qualities enumerated above.\r\n\r\n Such a schooling trained the women far better than all the colleges\r\n do now, in spite of their excellence; on the other hand, the\r\n complaints of the women students of to-day as to the disadvantages yet\r\n to be overcome are greater than they were then. Yet at this present\r\n time, almost every chance exists for women if it is in them, to become\r\n original investigators, workers and practitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n _Twenty-fifth anniversary of the New England Hospital--Drs.\r\n Zakrzewska, Sewall and Morton resign as attending physicians and\r\n are appointed advisory physicians--Presentation to the Hospital of\r\n portrait of Dr. Zakrzewska painted by Miss Ellen E. Hale--Address by\r\n Dr. Zakrzewska before the Moral Education Association--Her reply to\r\n the question “Should Women Study Medicine?”--Her opinion on “What’s in\r\n a Name?” (1887-1890.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1887, the Hospital celebrated its twenty-fifth anniversary, a\r\npleasant feature of the event being the presentation to the Hospital\r\nby the graduates and internes of the portrait of Dr. Zakrzewska. This\r\nwas painted by Miss Ellen E. Hale and was placed in the directors’\r\nparlor. The occasion was also marked by the resignation of all three\r\nof the attending physicians, Drs. Zakrzewska, Sewall, and Morton. So\r\nmany qualified women were becoming available for hospital service and\r\nwere asking for opportunities, that these three women who had borne the\r\nburden and heat of the earlier years felt they could now stand aside\r\nand make room for their younger sisters.\r\n\r\nTheir resignations were accepted and they were immediately appointed\r\nadvisory physicians, thus remaining in a position where their knowledge\r\nand skill continued to be available to the Hospital and to their\r\nsuccessors, those immediately following them being Dr. Emma L.\r\nCall[21] and the Drs. Augusta and Emily Pope.[22]\r\n\r\nThe additional time thus available to Dr. Zakrzewska gave her greater\r\nopportunity to respond to the many demands upon her for public speaking\r\nand writing.\r\n\r\nAn address delivered before the “Moral Education Association of\r\nMassachusetts” about this date is so timely, and so pertinent to the\r\nproblems which still beset us to-day, that it is here inserted:\r\n\r\n The question is often asked me by persons not attending these\r\n meetings, What is this Moral Education Association? and What does it\r\n intend to accomplish?\r\n\r\n When I reply, I always construct my explanation as I myself comprehend\r\n the motives of this Association and the purposes toward which we\r\n intend to work.\r\n\r\n I am naturally an optimist. I fully believe that the world--by which I\r\n mean the human beings on this mighty planet--is constantly improving;\r\n that we, as a people of to-day, are progressing; and that we have\r\n reached a condition of physical, mental and moral improvement such as\r\n has never before been attained by the inhabitants of this globe. Yet I\r\n feel that we are far from being what we might become if each one of us\r\n would carry out fully, all the time, daily and hourly, the precepts of\r\n the Golden Rule.\r\n\r\n In order to attain such a state of perfection, workers are constantly\r\n needed who, with deeper insight or stronger convictions or warmer\r\n hearts, shall lift the banner high over all our heads, and thus summon\r\n followers from all directions.\r\n\r\n Now I call this Moral Education Association such a banner.\r\n\r\n During the thirteenth century, after the knights of Middle and Western\r\n Europe returned from their crusading expeditions in the Holy Land and\r\n settled again in their homes, they formed an association, the chief\r\n object of which was to raise the “standard of honor.” A spoken word\r\n was an inviolable contract; an ignoble deed, however slight, was\r\n considered so dishonorable as to relegate the perpetrator from the\r\n order of knighthood.\r\n\r\n To many, it may seem to have been an unmeaning pastime, this\r\n cultivation by these men of an ideal honor in themselves and in\r\n others. Yet this movement ushered in a grand era of poetry, both lyric\r\n and dramatic, of chivalry, and of learning. It formed the nucleus of\r\n right in many directions and created a new code of morals.\r\n\r\n In this same sense, and applying it to the elevation of the honor of\r\n woman, I joined this Association because I know that it is a good\r\n field in which women can work by helping to create a code of morals\r\n befitting our enlightened age, a code which shall govern our relations\r\n to all mankind, to our children, to each other as women, and to the\r\n State.\r\n\r\n The increase of wealth and the increase of an intelligent population\r\n producing more and more wealth--this is the bright side of our\r\n progressive age. But there is also the dark side of the picture--the\r\n increase of luxury and its twin brother, sensuality.\r\n\r\n In nature, as a rule, it is the female who nurses the young into\r\n maturity; in this case, it is the female who must stifle these twin\r\n brothers while they are yet in their infancy, so that they may never\r\n reach their dangerous maturity.\r\n\r\n Luxury carried beyond a reasonable degree of comfort vitiates human\r\n strength and thus enervates both body and mind; then temporary\r\n stimulation and relief are sought in the excitements of sensuality.\r\n By sensuality, I understand all indulgences which carry to excess the\r\n natural physical appetites. Man, with his greater physical force, is\r\n the aggressive element in this strife for gratification, and woman\r\n with her slighter physique, the passive.\r\n\r\n If we first make these points clear to ourselves, it will be easy to\r\n make them clear to others and to show to every woman the necessity\r\n of being on the defensive against these twin brothers, Luxury and\r\n Sensuality. All history teaches us that they have been the destroyers\r\n of nations in ancient times. Let us not deem that we are proof against\r\n their omnipotence. The defensive weapon can be none other than a code\r\n of morals as high and as idealistic as our present state of education\r\n and development will produce.\r\n\r\n Further, this code ought to be in accordance with the political form\r\n of life in our country. We cannot afford to imitate any other people,\r\n any other nation. The women of this continent, and especially of the\r\n United States, enjoy a place in social life such as no women of any\r\n nation ever held before, or hold now. They can have all the power they\r\n want if they will simply take it, and if they will make themselves\r\n equal to all the responsibilities such a power involves.\r\n\r\n Especially do I wish to speak of a danger to be avoided. We need to\r\n create and to foster among women a realizing sense that we _are all\r\n alike_ and that the _worst_ women belong to _us_ as much\r\n as do the best. We cannot feel proud of the virtues and talents of one\r\n woman without feeling an equal degree of shame at the vices and the\r\n degradation of another.\r\n\r\n There is no _third sex_; and we must see to it that this\r\n feeling--I cannot call it an opinion--that there exists a class of\r\n _animal women_, shall never take root in this country. In order\r\n to effect this, we must create a code of morals in accordance with our\r\n free institutions. Never should we look across the ocean for a guiding\r\n rod. Nowhere has woman been so poetized and so idealized, nowhere have\r\n music and the plastic arts so celebrated her as on the continent of\r\n Europe--yet everywhere there woman can be bought! She is legalized\r\n merchandise, and is inspected as such for the purpose of purchase,\r\n _which is prostitution_.\r\n\r\n Among the nobility and the aristocracy the men hold it below their\r\n dignity and honor to be traders or even merchants because they\r\n consider that all commercial enterprise tends to make men mercenary,\r\n so lowering their character. Yet these same men do not hesitate to\r\n purchase women; while the aristocratic and noble lady thinks it right\r\n and just that there should be a special class of women for this\r\n purpose.\r\n\r\n This is no exaggerated statement; it is a fact that women of\r\n education and of high standing speak of a certain class of women as\r\n if there were a third sex--a creature resembling woman in all outward\r\n appearance but sterile in propagation, sterile in morals, and sterile\r\n in intellectual capacity, a slave to men, and a creature of contempt\r\n in the eyes of women.\r\n\r\n The word by which these women are designated when spoken of is\r\n “creature.” In Europe, in common conversation and in everyday\r\n literature, this word “creature” has become a legitimatized\r\n designation for prostitutes. It is therefore deplorable to hear women\r\n in their superior position as employers speak thoughtlessly of honest,\r\n virtuous women--their nurses, seamstresses, servants and the like--as\r\n “these creatures.”\r\n\r\n I say, therefore, that one of the laws of our moral code should be,\r\n “Respect the _woman_ in every woman.”\r\n\r\n This respect for all womankind leads us to consider next the moral\r\n relations to children. The highest ideal code cannot be too high here,\r\n and example should take precedence of teaching.\r\n\r\n I would advise a whole code, explanatory of modesty, purity, chastity,\r\n truthfulness, obedience, self-denial, and self-control, clearly to be\r\n comprehended and strictly to be practiced by every woman--married and\r\n unmarried, mothers and grandmothers--so that example shall teach the\r\n virtues to the boy as well as to the girl.\r\n\r\n Moral precepts and admonitions, repeated daily in words are listened\r\n to with indifference; but from a living example are drawn good\r\n draughts of healthful moral strength. For instance, speak before a\r\n boy, no matter how small (in fact, the smaller the more dangerous),\r\n with contempt of a woman, and you may be sure the seed of contempt\r\n toward all womanhood is sown and will grow and mature and bear fruit\r\n for another generation. The same is true if, in the hearing of girls,\r\n contempt for men is expressed; yet here the effect is less bad for, as\r\n I said before, the girl is the passive, not the aggressive, element in\r\n nature.\r\n\r\n Next, we need a moral code in relation to men. Here, the first\r\n principle should be, what is wrong in woman is wrong in man. There\r\n is no special right for the man. Although we cannot demonstrate an\r\n absolute Right, yet the Golden Rule will always serve as a test where\r\n there is doubt. Men are born as pure and innocent and good as women.\r\n _We develop_ qualities in them from a false conception of the\r\n aggressive impulses inherent in the masculine constitution. This\r\n is the point which we must bear in mind--man is not willfully nor\r\n intentionally vicious; but we allow him to practice a pernicious code\r\n of morals from early childhood, when we begin to say, “Oh, a boy will\r\n be a boy.”\r\n\r\n Of course, we want a man to be a man, but we also want a woman to\r\n be a woman. And we cannot make any advance toward the standard of a\r\n true man and a true woman if we give one set of morals to the man and\r\n another to the woman. Our constitution should be alike for both sexes,\r\n although from natural causes some of the by-laws must differ. This is\r\n the only way by which we can establish such relations of men to women\r\n and of women to men as shall be honorable to both and elevating to\r\n mankind in general.\r\n\r\n Let us now consider the last but not the least point in our code of\r\n morals, that which concerns our relation to the State. This is, of\r\n course, the broadest and the most comprehensive theme with which moral\r\n education has to deal. Here again we shall see that we have our own\r\n code to make. For by “State” we mean in this country a different thing\r\n from that which Europe so designates. We do not mean a government\r\n given to a people by an aristocracy established centuries ago. We must\r\n learn to understand that when we speak of “the State,” we mean the\r\n voluntary association of a free people which governs itself through\r\n and by the individual exercise of both intellectual and physical\r\n powers. Hence, there arises at once the need of a full comprehension\r\n of our duties as members of such a State.\r\n\r\n These duties are of two kinds--the duty of the normally endowed\r\n members (those having moderate or superior physical and mental\r\n qualities) toward each other; and, secondly, the duty of this\r\n fortunate class toward the less favored--the weak, the feeble in mind\r\n or in body and the crippled--those born or later afflicted with less\r\n capacity to take up the struggle for existence. We have all seen\r\n how the man born rich may become poor; and on the other hand, how\r\n the child born a pauper may yet lift himself to the position of the\r\n millionaire or to the highest office.\r\n\r\n Here, then, lies our duty. Especially must we women educate ourselves\r\n and the young in regard to our relations to all humanity--particularly\r\n to the suffering, to the frail, and to the poor near our own doors. We\r\n have to create a code of morals strong enough to be just toward all\r\n the unfortunate--men, women and children; yet it must be free from\r\n that sentimentalism which cannot discriminate between an honest poor\r\n person and a criminal. On this point, endless illustrations could be\r\n given to show our lack of moral education. How difficult it is to\r\n preserve the righteous balance without being harsh to the criminal,\r\n the drunkard and the female vagrant! We have this great lesson to\r\n learn--that the poorest, the lowest, even the most degraded, when\r\n honestly striving to keep out of the almshouse or the prison, stands\r\n far higher in the scale of humanity than the reformed or the reforming\r\n prisoner; and that justice ought first to be done toward these poor\r\n degraded ones before sentimental charity is bestowed upon the criminal.\r\n\r\n For here comes another part of this code as regards the State. What\r\n is charity? What is benevolence? What is the best way for their\r\n application? What is justice?\r\n\r\n I would advise that all the members of this Moral Education\r\n Association, and nonmembers too, form classes where these subjects\r\n may be discussed, not simply where morality is preached to the moral,\r\n but where we enlighten ourselves by an interchange of opinion and by\r\n faithful investigation of moral questions. We need to know what is the\r\n real moral requirement in our peculiar state of American society.\r\n\r\n We are a State which has not been produced by propagation of one and\r\n the same race, so we have thus formed a nation with its own peculiar\r\n characteristics. We are an aggregate in a free country of many races\r\n and of many nations, a country where it is possible for the slave to\r\n step at once into self-sovereignty, or for the pauper from any foreign\r\n race to rise in a few years to the position of a well-to-do trader or\r\n merchant or artist, according to the intellectual capacity which he\r\n possesses. On the other hand, even with us these people may go down\r\n and form the center of a proletarianism unless they are prevented by\r\n education both of the intellect and of the morals.\r\n\r\nA similar opportuneness characterizes her answer to the question which\r\ncontinues to be asked to-day as it has been asked down the ages:\r\n\r\n\r\n  SHOULD WOMEN STUDY MEDICINE?\r\n\r\n So many women, both young and of mature age, appeal to me for\r\n information concerning the profession of medicine that I have thought\r\n it desirable to express my opinion thus publicly. The principal points\r\n inquired about are How to study medicine? and What are the prospects\r\n in practice?\r\n\r\n There are so many medical schools now open to women, both in the\r\n East and in the West, that the selection of one for the purpose of\r\n study need depend only upon individual convenience and the pecuniary\r\n resources of the student. A student needs to have means for her\r\n support during three full years of college life and, if possible, for\r\n an additional year’s residence in some hospital before entering upon\r\n practice.\r\n\r\n Next comes the question, What can she expect in practice? Many young\r\n women enter the profession because it seems to them a lucrative\r\n business. Yet for a young person to choose this path in life because\r\n she thinks it leads invariably to success--by which she means a\r\n plentiful purse--is a mistake.\r\n\r\n Success in the practice of medicine may coexist with small pecuniary\r\n gains; the money gain should be incidental, not primary, in the\r\n thought of the physician. A well-educated physician, who has passed\r\n through the regular course of study and who conscientiously works\r\n within the legitimate sphere of her knowledge, must allow about ten\r\n years of indefatigable labor before her practice brings a competency\r\n worthy the name of independence, by which I mean a comfortable living\r\n free from the anxieties of petty economies and allowing occasional\r\n relaxations from duty. Many a young woman has gone out of my office\r\n excited and indignant because I have expressed doubt that the medical\r\n profession would be the best career for her to choose, and her final\r\n exclamation as she left me is very significant, “You have been\r\n successful; why should not I be so?”\r\n\r\n This “why not” is just the hard point to explain. On April 5, 1888,\r\n it was just thirty-six years since I began to seek practice.\r\n Young (twenty-two and one-half years old), full of enthusiasm and\r\n self-reliance, willing to work, ready for self-abnegation in every\r\n direction, I felt sure that I should succeed in life, but this success\r\n never presented itself before my mind in the shape of a plentiful\r\n purse.\r\n\r\n Besides the moral qualities I have mentioned, I started with another\r\n great advantage, namely, a good physical constitution. In no\r\n profession is sound steady health so requisite as in the medical, for\r\n the practitioner must be ready night and day, and at the beck and call\r\n of patients--whether paying or charity. Thus this profession demands\r\n a body free from annoyances of all kinds and a clear, sound head, to\r\n enable one to be decisive in judgment, firm in advice, and kind in\r\n sympathy.\r\n\r\n Another step in the ladder of success is a good business training from\r\n early youth. By this I mean correctness in listening to every word\r\n spoken, accuracy of observation, and logical deduction. Every faculty\r\n must be, as it were, on the alert and yet kept under the control of\r\n judgment.\r\n\r\n Yet there may be sound health, good education, and carefully trained\r\n faculties, and still a something lacking for success in life as\r\n physician. I call it a power of adaptation to the various temperaments\r\n and conditions of humanity; a moral courage; an ability to step\r\n forward and seek opportunities for practice; a kind of self-confidence\r\n and fearlessness in entering every class of life.\r\n\r\n Thus equipped, and backed by friends or pecuniary means to sustain\r\n the respectability of the beginner during the first few years of\r\n her attempts to seek practice, a young woman has still to overcome\r\n prejudices and obstacles which are not easily described, for they are\r\n of an intangible nature, relating sometimes to personal appearance\r\n and oftener to that indefinable quality--tact.\r\n\r\n Yet notwithstanding all these difficulties, it is far easier to-day\r\n for a woman to establish herself as physician than it was thirty\r\n years ago. The annoyance and tribulations which we pioneers had to\r\n endure were far greater than the natural ones which have always to\r\n be overcome. For women physicians were then looked upon not only as\r\n intruders upon the field hitherto occupied by men alone, but also as\r\n disreputable persons and they were constantly confounded with the\r\n women who, prefixing “Dr.” to their names, carried on a foul and\r\n illegal practice.\r\n\r\n So great was the prejudice against the first women physicians that\r\n friends and acquaintances hesitated to invite them into their social\r\n circles. Yet in spite of this hostility, I was inclined to encourage\r\n other women to study medicine; for, inexperienced like all young\r\n people and more enthusiastic than most, I imagined that every one who\r\n expressed a desire for some active work was as willing and as well\r\n prepared to undergo hardships and privations as I myself was. Years\r\n have made me wiser and, consequently, more cautious in advising these\r\n young seekers.\r\n\r\n Every physician, man or woman, who has acquired prominence through\r\n ability, finds himself or herself placed in the position of adviser\r\n to youth. No one claims infallibility in judgment; great talent is\r\n not always recognizable to the wisest counselor; but the duty is the\r\n same for all--a conscientious statement of what the medical profession\r\n demands. Its difficulties and the various obstacles should be stated\r\n clearly to the young man or woman who is so often dazzled by the\r\n brilliant success of the few, forgetting the many who are plodding\r\n along in economical, modest paths or have retired entirely, and who\r\n are therefore unknown.\r\n\r\n Yet while I have thus shown the darker side, I can see that the study\r\n of medicine is full of opportunities for women, and that there are so\r\n many ways of becoming useful, if not as practitioners then as teachers\r\n and resident physicians in female schools and colleges, that no\r\n truly talented woman need fear want of success in some branch of the\r\n profession.--_The Woman’s Journal, June 23, 1888._\r\n\r\nLess weighty but not less serious, and again as though a response to\r\nanother question which is agitating us to-day, is the following article\r\nreprinted from _The Woman’s Journal_ of April 5, 1890:\r\n\r\n\r\n  WHAT’S IN A NAME?\r\n\r\n It may be true that “a rose by any other name would smell as sweet.”\r\n But even Shakespeare does not convince us that a Montague would\r\n not still be a Montague though called by another name. No, the\r\n name becomes a part of the individuality. A name has two distinct\r\n qualities--the lighter, social and emotional; and the graver, legal\r\n and representative. Pet names denote affection and are usually applied\r\n to infants as expressive of their helplessness or diminutiveness in\r\n contrast to our superiority to their small persons. The continued use\r\n of these pet names when their bearers fill active and responsible\r\n positions in life, indicates thoughtlessness if not real inferiority\r\n of intellect.\r\n\r\n To explain my meaning fully, I will illustrate from my own experience\r\n both conditions--the social and the legal value of names. Quite\r\n recently I was asked whether I knew a Dr. Carrie S----, of ----town,\r\n whom the inquirer wished to consult on arriving there. Instinctively\r\n I replied that I should not care to know a “Dr. Carrie” or “Hattie”\r\n or “Maggie,” etc., and I certainly would not ask the advice of any\r\n physician who had not more sense than to advertise herself by sign\r\n or word as a diminutive person. How can a woman think deeply on any\r\n subject who has not brains enough to object to such pet names?\r\n\r\n A short time ago, a friend who was visiting me handed me two letters\r\n to be posted. One was addressed “Mr. C. Albert ----” and the other,\r\n “Miss Nellie ----.” Glancing at the addresses, I remarked, “I thought\r\n your son’s name was Bert as I have always heard him called so, and why\r\n has your sister changed her name from Ellen?” This sister was then\r\n forty years old and had been teacher to her sister’s sons who lived in\r\n the country where there was a lack of schools suitable to prepare lads\r\n for the Latin school. Yet my friend said in reply to my remark, “No,\r\n my son’s name is Albert and we called him Bert or Bertie, but since\r\n he entered Harvard College, he has forbidden our using those names,\r\n because,” she added, “boys, you know, have more pride than girls. My\r\n sister likes to be addressed as Nellie.” Thus the teacher, twenty-two\r\n years older than her nephew, was denoted by spoken and written word\r\n “a girl” without “pride.” I wish all girls and women would comprehend\r\n this fact--that as long as they are pleased with a diminutive name, so\r\n long will they be classed in the category of diminutive human beings.\r\n\r\n Again, consider the ludicrous side. Here enters a woman twenty years\r\n old, six feet tall, addressed as Maggie. Now, must such a woman\r\n reach a height of eighteen feet before she attains the dignity of\r\n “Margaret”--that is, the name of a full-grown woman?\r\n\r\n I once had under my medical care a girl whose face was greatly\r\n disfigured by an eruption. She had a dark complexion and dark hair,\r\n yet her name was Lily. When a little more than fourteen years old,\r\n she came to me, her eyes sparkling with delight. “Oh,” she said, “I\r\n have found out that my real name is Lucy; I was called so for an aunt\r\n who died last week and who left me one thousand dollars in her will\r\n because I am her namesake. I cried for joy, not about the money,\r\n but because I have got rid of that horrid name of Lily.” Seeing my\r\n astonishment at her excitement, she added, “You do not know how I\r\n have suffered from my schoolmates; they nicknamed me Tiger Lily on\r\n account of my face, and now, see, Lily was only a pet name; it is not\r\n my real name!” Her mind was relieved, she was at ease and happy to\r\n assert her dignity by an appropriate name. She soon recovered from the\r\n torment of the eruption, and I have no doubt that the mental relief\r\n of having a sensible name aided in her recovery. Again, how would a\r\n woman with the dignified name of Margaret feel if she read in the\r\n newspaper the notice of her marriage with “Tommy” Smith? A certain\r\n amount of etiquette is essential in life--it gives weight and dignity\r\n to everyday occurrences, and is, as it were, an expression of a sense\r\n of social responsibilities.\r\n\r\n The second question is the legal and representative quality. To\r\n understand the full importance of this, let us recall the fact that\r\n throughout the whole civilized globe, it is customary to give to the\r\n child the father’s name. It is not necessary to discuss here whether\r\n it would be better to change this custom and give to the child the\r\n name of both father and mother. The fact is established that the\r\n child receives a personal name prefixed to that of the family of\r\n which it is the offspring. By this latter name it becomes known, and\r\n in the course of years this name becomes a part of the individual,\r\n belongs to the character itself, and can no more be got rid of than\r\n the blood which flows in the veins and had its origin in the parents.\r\n It is a rare thing for a man to admit even the thought of changing his\r\n name; if it were Smith, he is and remains Smith, simply denoting his\r\n individuality by the prefix _A_, _B_, _C_, or whatever\r\n the initial may be. He cannot be addressed by any other name, and he\r\n can receipt bills and sign legal papers by no other name without being\r\n considered guilty of misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n The importance of this individuality of name is nowhere better\r\n recognized than in Germany. A girl named at birth Anna Eleanora Miller\r\n is and remains Anna Eleanora Miller all her lifetime, no matter\r\n whether she marries once or six times in the course of her career. By\r\n no other name can she sign a deed or contract; thus only can she bear\r\n witness; and she is not summoned by the courts as witness under any\r\n other name than that of Anna Eleanora Miller.\r\n\r\n If she has a husband, she is addressed in law by her name, Anna\r\n Eleanora (or, if she has ten given names, then by all of them) Miller,\r\n wife of Brown, or wife of Baron Ketzow, or von Alden. If she becomes\r\n a widow and marries again, she is addressed in law (of course not in\r\n social intercourse) as Anna Eleanora Miller, widow of Brown, wife of\r\n Baron von Ketzow.\r\n\r\n To make this clearer, let me illustrate still further by giving the\r\n name of a well-known lady who, after she became a widow, studied\r\n medicine and now practices dentistry in Berlin, having been dentist\r\n to all the children of the Empress Friedrich. Her diploma would be\r\n utterly valueless had it been given to her with the name of her\r\n first husband; only by her maiden name could she be authorized as a\r\n practitioner. Her sign at the door reads, “Dr. Henriette Pagelson,\r\n widow of Hirschfeld, wife of Tiburtius,” she having, after a few\r\n years of practice, contracted a marriage with Dr. Tiburtius. Thus she\r\n is, and remains, Henriette Pagelson, and by this name only is she\r\n professionally and legally responsible; this stamps her individuality,\r\n and the other names of Mrs. Hirschfeld and Mrs. Tiburtius become\r\n merely social and conventional designations.\r\n\r\n The question of changing names will and ought to become of grave\r\n importance before the law in this country. As we now have women\r\n lawyers, it should be their special charge to bring up at once this\r\n neglected matter--the question of the legality of diplomas as regards\r\n the names thereon--before the legislatures in their respective states.\r\n\r\n Let me suppose a case in order to show the gravity of this subject.\r\n A young woman who has studied medicine receives a diploma under the\r\n name of Anna Elizabeth Brown. In a few years she marries, removes the\r\n sign from her door and puts up a new one reading “Dr. A. E. Stone.”\r\n Soon after this she has to sign a death certificate, which she does\r\n by writing “Anna Elizabeth Stone, M.D.” Such a document has no legal\r\n truth in it. Again, suppose the relatives of a patient sue this doctor\r\n for malpractice, cannot the lawyer make a good case from the fact\r\n that her diploma certifies to the ability of “Anna E. Brown,” and\r\n that a “Dr. Stone” does not exist? Does not this create a flaw or an\r\n irregularity in the indictment executed by the complainants? Still\r\n further, the husband “Stone” dies, and in a year the widow marries\r\n McIntosh and again changes sign and signature to “Dr. A. E. McIntosh,”\r\n while no diploma, and therefore no such doctor of that name exists,\r\n but only the original “Anna Elizabeth Brown, M.D.”\r\n\r\n What is thus true in the medical profession is true in commercial\r\n pursuits and in all professions. Annoyances also arise in social\r\n relations. A short time ago, I was asked if I knew a Dr. Alice\r\n Smith of a certain city, she having referred to me for professional\r\n recommendation. I at once declared the woman to be a fraud. A few\r\n months later, Dr. Alice Smith, having been informed of my not very\r\n complimentary appellation, sent me a letter expressive of much injured\r\n feeling. In this letter, she gave her maiden name under which she had\r\n served as interne in our New England Hospital where we had valued her\r\n as one of our best assistants.\r\n\r\n Now, if men cannot see the importance of this demand for a settlement\r\n of the question of women’s names, I wish that our women lawyers would\r\n bring the subject before the legislatures, requesting some decision on\r\n the legal qualifications as to names for any professional or business\r\n relation of women, whether they are single, married or widowed. If the\r\n woman cannot call her name her own and will not drop the diminutive\r\n pet name, she does not deserve to be considered a full human being.\r\n\r\n Let me be understood--I do not mean to say that in social life a\r\n woman should not accept the name of her husband. I do not desire to\r\n overturn existing customs, and I think it is far more sensible to\r\n be “Mrs. Smith” in common social life than to be “Dr. Brown,” which\r\n may be the title on the diploma, but all this could easily be left\r\n to personal decision. Princess Louise of England will not be called\r\n Marchioness of Lorne. Baroness von Essmarsch prefers to be called Frau\r\n Doctor (having married Dr. von Essmarsch), and objects to the title\r\n of Princess Mecklenberg to which she is entitled, and by which she is\r\n addressed, as aunt of the present Empress of Germany. Here love casts\r\n aside all titles; nevertheless, it is only as Princess Mecklenberg\r\n that she can legally be addressed, or legally be empowered to sell or\r\n to give away even a few feet of land. The only signature valid in law\r\n is “Princess Mecklenberg, wife of Dr. von Essmarsch.”\r\n\r\n Throughout Europe, the women in all classes cling more closely to\r\n their family names than we do. On visiting cards, one commonly sees\r\n “Mrs. Brown, _née_ Miller.” If one wishes to be specially\r\n respectful, one addresses in the same way, mentioning both names, the\r\n envelope which incloses even a friendly letter to a married woman.\r\n And, finally, on the gravestone placed above a deceased married woman,\r\n the maiden name is always conspicuously inscribed before the married\r\n name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n _Opening of the Medical School of the Johns Hopkins University to\r\n women on equal terms with men--Consultations with Dr. Zakrzewska by\r\n women interested in the event--Her report of the attitude of the\r\n community towards women surgeons--New building for the Maternity\r\n Department of the Hospital (the Sewall Maternity and, later, the Helen\r\n Morton Wing)--Opening of the Goddard Home for Nurses--Because of\r\n misbehavior of men students, Columbia University of Georgetown closes\r\n its doors to women--Dr. Zakrzewska writes on “the Emancipation of\r\n Woman: Will it be a Success?” (1888-1894.)_\r\n\r\n\r\nThese were eventful days (1888-1890) for all friends of the advancement\r\nof the medical education of women, leading up as they did to the\r\nopening to women of the medical school of the Johns Hopkins University\r\nin 1890.\r\n\r\nThe same fear of beguilement and subsequent disillusionment which Dr.\r\nZakrzewska had felt regarding the proposed opening to women of the\r\nMedical School of Harvard University, away back at the time when the\r\nfuture of the New England Female Medical College hung in the balance,\r\nhaunted the minds of all workers for the cause of medical women.\r\n\r\nSo many colleges had been opened to women and had then been closed to\r\nthem, in response to the storm raised by one or another protesting\r\ngroup, that experience had made women feel they must always be on their\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nOne of the prominent women of Worcester wrote to Dr. Zakrzewska in 1890:\r\n\r\n Our Women’s Club has been urged to contribute to assist the Medical\r\n School of the Johns Hopkins University, with the idea that women shall\r\n have there all the advantages which men have, and as I have seen your\r\n name with other well-known names, I desire to ask if you really think\r\n that they will act in good faith if the $100,000 should be given them.\r\n\r\n We are told by parties in Baltimore who ought to know that the whole\r\n policy of Johns Hopkins is conservative in spite of its high rank, and\r\n that women would never be admitted on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\n As one of an investigating committee, I am to report on October 22d.\r\n Will you be so kind as to tell me what you think of the scheme? If\r\n the money is raised and offered on condition that women shall be so\r\n received, we are told that it will be refused. In that case, it would\r\n not seem worth while to give anything towards it.\r\n\r\n This must be a matter which would greatly interest you, and I venture\r\n to hope that you will find a moment to reply.\r\n\r\nIn the course of her correspondence with Dr. Zakrzewska, a leading\r\nwoman of Baltimore who was one of those foremost in the present\r\nmovement, writes:\r\n\r\n I will bear your cautions in mind and watch very carefully. I myself\r\n have not much confidence in the willingness of many men to give\r\n women a fair chance, but since out of the four women who began this\r\n movement, three of them have fathers on the two boards who are deeply\r\n convinced of the righteousness of the cause, I cannot help feeling\r\n hopeful. Moreover, the physicians at the Hospital have been most\r\n cordial and helpful to every well-qualified woman who has sought its\r\n advantages.\r\n\r\n I inclose a copy of the trustees’ resolutions. I do not see how,\r\n although they reserve the right of making “such rules and regulations\r\n as they may deem necessary for the government of its School of\r\n Medicine,” they can possibly ignore the paragraph that “in making\r\n such rules and regulations, the terms of this minute shall always be\r\n respected and observed”--and these terms we insisted should be _the\r\n same_, not equal.\r\n\r\n However, I agree with you that we must watch carefully, and if there\r\n should ever be a sign of trying to evade it you may depend on us to\r\n fight it out.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that half of the $100,000 was given by one\r\nwoman, Miss Mary Garrett, daughter of one of the original trustees of\r\nthe Johns Hopkins University. Also, that the $10,000 previously offered\r\nby Miss Hovey to Harvard, on condition of its admitting women and which\r\nwas declined by its medical faculty, was transferred to the Johns\r\nHopkins.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1888, Dr. Zakrzewska and her two earliest co-workers on\r\nthe Hospital staff, Drs. Sewall and Morton, resigned as attending\r\nphysicians and became advisory physicians, Dr. Sewall had in the state\r\nof her health an additional reason for relinquishing her arduous\r\nduties. And Dr. Zakrzewska suffered keenly during the next few years in\r\nrealizing the approaching loss of this particularly dear colleague,\r\nwho had always been to her as her own child though her junior by only a\r\nfew years. Dr. Sewall died in February, 1890.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting at the close of the Hospital year, 1890, Dr.\r\nZakrzewska again was called upon to present the report from the\r\nresident physician--this position being temporarily vacant.\r\n\r\nReferring especially to the increasing work of the Hospital under women\r\nsurgeons, she says:\r\n\r\n The results thus far are so satisfactory that no other hospital can\r\n show a greater percentage of recoveries. Our reputation for successful\r\n operations increases; and the request is often made by patients that\r\n no men shall be present.\r\n\r\n An old lady of seventy-nine years, the prolongation of whose life\r\n depended upon the immediate removal of a large ovarian tumor--an\r\n accidental fall having caused inflammation--insisted upon having\r\n even no consultation with men, nor any men present at the operation,\r\n saying, “I am old enough anyway to die, only I don’t want to suffer\r\n as I do now; and if the women can save my life for a while longer, I\r\n shall be grateful.” She was saved, and went home well in just four\r\n weeks from the day of operation.\r\n\r\n Another change has come with this advance in the medical women’s\r\n world. Women now express the strongest confidence in women’s skill,\r\n entirely refuting the fears and opinions of former years that “women\r\n would never have confidence in their own sex.” The opposite condition\r\n has now become so manifest that when in a first consultation a patient\r\n decides at once and unreservedly to employ a woman surgeon, we are\r\n frequently obliged to remind her that her friends or her family may\r\n prefer to have a man perform the operation.\r\n\r\n A patient was brought into my office from the carriage before the\r\n door. She seemed so weak and exhausted that I did not venture to\r\n speak frankly to her but called the friends into an outer room and\r\n informed them of the need of the removal of a large abdominal tumor\r\n without delay. After a short deliberation, they considered it best\r\n for me to inform the patient. I did so. A few moments of silence\r\n ensued, and then came the response, “Where can it be done? Will you do\r\n it?” Answering the latter question in the negative and the former by\r\n proposing our Hospital, she replied, “Well, take me there and I will\r\n have it done to-morrow.”\r\n\r\n We did take her there, but the case was too grave for an operation\r\n on the morrow as important preparations were necessary. But in a few\r\n months the patient left the Hospital well, and when a half year later\r\n she came into my office, I did not recognize the changed woman.\r\n\r\n Such cases are not infrequent now, and the gratitude of many a mother,\r\n wife, and daughter spreads throughout our land the fame of our\r\n Hospital, the skill of our surgeons, and the kindness of our nurses.\r\n The number of women surgeons is but few as yet, but I do not care to\r\n compete numerically with men. I simply repeat the claim which I made\r\n thirty-five years ago when pleading the cause of women physicians,\r\n namely, give to women whose qualifications and tastes lead them to\r\n study the healing art, the opportunity to develop such talents to the\r\n utmost on an equality with men.\r\n\r\n It is due to the perseverance of woman’s nature and to the freedom\r\n of this country that such comparatively great results have been\r\n achieved in so few years. I, who saw at most a possibility in the\r\n dim future, am permitted to behold an idea realized--an idea for the\r\n materialization of which I expected simply to plow the ground before\r\n I passed away from this life, leaving it for others to cultivate. But\r\n see! Already, under the sunshine of free institutions and the favoring\r\n breezes of universal progress, we reap the fruits of our labor.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1892, a new Maternity Building was completed and dedicated.\r\nIt was named the Sewall Maternity, in memory of that early and devoted\r\nfriend of Dr. Zakrzewska and the Hospital, Hon. Samuel E. Sewall,\r\nand of his daughter, Dr. Lucy E. Sewall, who was, successively, Dr.\r\nZakrzewska’s first student, assistant, and staff colleague.\r\n\r\nThe old Maternity was renovated and transformed into a home for the\r\nnurses, and it served this purpose until replaced by a new building in\r\n1909. It was named the Goddard Home for Nurses in honor of the Goddard\r\nfamily--Miss Lucy Goddard, one of the incorporators of the Hospital and\r\nfirst president of the board of directors; George A. Goddard, for many\r\nyears the devoted treasurer of the Hospital; and his mother, Mrs. M. Le\r\nB. Goddard, one of the earlier directors.\r\n\r\nSome years later (1906), a wing was added to the Sewall Maternity,\r\nthe Helen Morton Wing. This was named in honor of Dr. Helen Morton,\r\nclassmate of Dr. Sewall and Dr. Zakrzewska’s second student, assistant,\r\nand staff colleague.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the congratulations and rejoicings which followed the\r\nopening to women of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, the distrust\r\nwhich Dr. Zakrzewska had already voiced was, in 1893, given another\r\njustification by the action of the Columbian University of Georgetown,\r\nD. C. (now the George Washington University Medical School), which\r\ndecided to close the doors that it had opened to women.\r\n\r\nFor at least ten years the medical department had been graduating\r\nwomen on equal terms with men. But there had always been three members\r\nof the faculty who were bitterly opposed to allowing women to study\r\nmedicine on any terms. These three professors made the path of the\r\nwomen students as rough and stony as possible; and the male students,\r\ntaking the cue from these professors, added discourtesies and affronts\r\nto hostility.\r\n\r\nFinally, in the dissecting room, some of these students so debased\r\nthemselves by offering insult, not only to the women medical students\r\nbut also to the helpless bodies of their fellow beings who had been\r\ngiven to them for scientific study, that the faculty and trustees were\r\nobliged to take official notice of the occurrence.\r\n\r\nNow, mark the administration of justice. The male students committed\r\nthe offense which no one attempted to condone. Were the offenders\r\npunished? No. Neither were the innocent victims of the offense, the\r\nwomen medical students. But the whole sex of the innocent victims was\r\nselected to make vicarious atonement. The verdict was that the women\r\nthen in the Medical School should be permitted to complete their\r\ncourse, but after that no more women should be admitted to the school.\r\n\r\nAfter this demonstration can any one doubt that the story of Adam and\r\nEve and the Garden of Eden has biologic foundation and, as the good\r\nold books say, “is in the nature of man.” But we can rejoice that this\r\nis a nature which man is steadily moving upward to modify and correct,\r\nhence the increasing number of men who are willing to do justice to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add that the trustees were said to have been almost\r\nunanimous in their opposition to the exclusion of women but to have\r\nbeen overborne by the financial control exerted by the three professors\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThe indignation of a large portion of the lay community was aroused\r\nby the injustice thus done to women, and an appeal for advice was\r\nmade to Dr. Zakrzewska, whose views on such a situation have already\r\nbeen stated. Fortunately, the Johns Hopkins Medical School is not far\r\nremoved from Washington.\r\n\r\nThe era of the “emancipation” of woman as an all-inclusive phrase had\r\nnot yet passed, though it was approaching its eclipse by more specific\r\nterms. Using it as an antithesis of “oppression,” Dr. Zakrzewska writes\r\nin _The Open Court_, June 21, 1894, on “The Emancipation of Woman:\r\nWill it be a Success?”\r\n\r\nThis article was in reply to one on “The Oppression of Woman,”\r\nevidently written by a man who voiced his protest against the\r\nsubjection from which women have suffered for so many centuries, and\r\nwho claimed for women freedom to develop along their own lines. His\r\nplea was apparently similar to Tennyson’s when the latter sings:\r\n\r\n  ... “Leave her space to burgeon out of all\r\n  Within her--let her make herself her own\r\n  To give or keep, to live and learn and be\r\n  All that not harms distinctive womanhood.\r\n  For woman is not undevelopt man,\r\n  But diverse.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps, as is so often the case, an undercurrent of masculine\r\npatronage had crept into the plea of the advocate. Or perhaps Dr.\r\nZakrzewska merely felt the weariness that comes to all normal grown-up\r\nwomen when their normality and growth are commented upon as phenomena,\r\ninstead of being accepted as the thing to be expected. On a very\r\nhot day, the chirr of even a friendly katydid may seem too obvious,\r\nrepeating (what should be) “an undisputed thing in such a solemn way.”\r\nAt any rate, she responds:\r\n\r\n I admit that the writer of this article is right, positively right,\r\n logically right, sentimentally right, to the end of these reasonings\r\n which are lucid and clearly stated.\r\n\r\n Then I ask, What is the value of this new point, this proving that the\r\n evolution of woman’s activity cannot be otherwise than feminine? If\r\n twice two make four, no exertion of either man or woman can make it\r\n five. Let us leave it as a positive fact, and not worry when we see\r\n any individual trying to prove that twice two make five.\r\n\r\n Why are all these mental somersaults and caprioles in men’s writings\r\n needed? Will their attempts at prophesying or illustrating the future\r\n effects arising from the activity of a yet unknown quantity alter or\r\n check the present phenomenal awakening of woman’s ambition?\r\n\r\n Allow me to elucidate my meaning by a true story of what happened in\r\n my native city, Berlin, about fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n In a courtyard lived a poor family. The father was a locksmith by\r\n trade. His eldest son, a boy of twelve, bright, industrious and smart,\r\n spent all his time either in the schoolroom or in his father’s shop.\r\n Not even on Sundays could this poor family enjoy rest but worked in\r\n the dreary shop. The boy was very fond of eating string beans which\r\n the mother could seldom afford to buy.\r\n\r\n He therefore decided to raise them in a box before his window. He used\r\n some old pieces of boards for the construction of his window-garden,\r\n and all the inmates of the front as well as of the rear houses became\r\n interested in his experiment, everybody feeling it to be his or her\r\n duty to express opinions on the subject.\r\n\r\n Thus it came to pass that the boy was told that the beans planted\r\n would rot because the boards were not porous enough to allow air to\r\n pass; that the soil in the box could not be regulated as regarded the\r\n daily moisture needed; that the rain could not be discharged after\r\n flooding the window garden; that the heat of the sun reflected from\r\n the window glass would burn the tender growths; that not more than two\r\n stalks of beans could be raised if the seed turned out to be dwarf\r\n beans, and if pole beans, he could not fasten them high enough; that\r\n no good growth could be expected if there were not a flow of air all\r\n around to favor the plant; that the already dark room (this being\r\n the only window) would be darkened too much by the growing plants\r\n and thus the three children who slept in it would not awaken in time\r\n for school, which commenced at seven o’clock; that the health of the\r\n children would be injured by the exhalation of the plants and the\r\n moisture of the earth in the box; that his mother should be warned not\r\n to allow such an experiment as it would be a moral injury to the boy\r\n when he found himself disappointed in the success of his plan, as the\r\n most valuable of emotions--hope--would thus be destroyed; that the\r\n father ought to realize that he would lose at least half an hour daily\r\n of the boy’s help in the shop; in fact, all the arguments and all the\r\n prophesying were that a complete failure would be the result and that\r\n the boy would be crushed under the weight of it.\r\n\r\n However, the boy prepared his box, took note of the many suggestions\r\n and obviated some of them, as by perforating his box with small holes,\r\n by opening the windows when the sun shone from ten in the morning to\r\n three in the afternoon, etc.\r\n\r\n The twelve beans which he had planted grew and proved to be pole\r\n beans, so he tied strings for them to climb up on as high as the\r\n tenant above his room allowed him to do. He watered and nursed his\r\n plantation with care and love, and lo and behold, the beans flourished\r\n and blossomed and bore fruit relatively plentifully.\r\n\r\n During this time of growth, an old and wise tenant of the front house,\r\n also a professor, joined the group who for eight weeks had watched\r\n and discussed in the yard this willful boy’s experiment. This critic\r\n remarked that he observed a new phase of which nobody had thus far\r\n taken notice and which might have both good and bad effects, namely,\r\n that a hailstorm might yet come and destroy this garden, although\r\n there might also be a good result as the plants would protect the\r\n window panes if the storm should occur when the windows were closed.\r\n\r\n All admitted that this was true, and all admired the wisdom of the\r\n Herr Professor, and went to their respective abodes a little mortified\r\n that they had not thought before of this neglected point of the\r\n subject.\r\n\r\n The boy had the satisfaction of gathering a mess of well-grown beans,\r\n sufficient for a hearty meal for the whole family. But while eating\r\n his favorite dish, he said, “Well, mother, I did succeed; but to tell\r\n the truth, the beans don’t taste so good as those which grow in the\r\n fields. So next year, I will not try again but I shall sow nasturtium\r\n seeds for you to enjoy.”\r\n\r\n He did so, and his window was a perfect delight and source of cheer\r\n to him, to his mother, and to the tenants of the little court. He\r\n continued to do this until he had to enter the army, at eighteen years\r\n of age. His younger brothers (he had no sisters) followed in his\r\n footsteps, and when I left Berlin my last look was at the nasturtium\r\n window.\r\n\r\n Let me ask, did it matter much which the boy raised, beans or\r\n nasturtiums? What use was it to him, or to his family, or to the\r\n tenants when the latter all joined in the chorus, “I thought so” or “I\r\n told him he could not raise beans”? Let each one try nature’s forces\r\n and take his chance! And twice two will always remain four.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n _Dr. Zakrzewska’s own description of her attitude as a critic--Her\r\n judgments on various details of Hospital policy: Against the admission\r\n to the Hospital of women students of the Boston University Medical\r\n School (that being then a school of homeopathy); On the reciprocal\r\n relation of the medical staff and the board of directors of the\r\n Hospital; On a question of Hospital discipline; Letter to an ambitious\r\n colleague whose feelings have been hurt._\r\n\r\n\r\nMatters of Hospital policy were continually being referred to her for\r\ndecision. Before noting details, it will be illuminating to read what\r\nshe says as to her mental attitude when making criticisms:\r\n\r\n If I praise, it is hardly ever the person or the relation in\r\n which this person stands to me of which I think--it is simply the\r\n praiseworthy thing or deed which I eulogize.\r\n\r\n These very same persons may do or say something which, according to my\r\n comprehension, is not praiseworthy but the contrary, and I criticize\r\n and blame just as strongly as I praised before when many did not see\r\n the praiseworthiness until I drew attention to it.\r\n\r\n For the praise, I receive thanks, for human nature likes far better to\r\n hear agreeable things than disagreeable ones.\r\n\r\n For the blame, where I pointed out the fault, I receive double\r\n reproach, for human nature likes to defend, it is vexed because\r\n its attention has been drawn to the fact of imperfection and its\r\n displeasure tends to fall upon the person who points out this\r\n imperfection.\r\n\r\n I am fully aware that gratitude and warm friendships are easily\r\n gained by speaking well of everything and everybody. Hence it is that\r\n secondary, yes, even very mediocre, talents receive a certain amount\r\n of fame and appreciation by the multitude.\r\n\r\n But to a true nature such kind of appreciation is humbling; and\r\n that, too, in just such a degree as to him or her, praise or blame,\r\n appreciation or censure, are equally sacred. One who is satisfied with\r\n the recognition of the few can calmly wait till the multitude find out\r\n for themselves how much of the seed sown among them will grow.\r\n\r\n Therefore, when I mention names to you, pray do not believe I speak\r\n of them because they are either friends or foes to me, or that I wish\r\n either to please or to hurt. Both are far from me--I do not care to\r\n please, nor do I want to hurt, anybody.\r\n\r\nIn answer to a proposal in earlier years to admit to the New England\r\nHospital the women students of the Medical Department of the Boston\r\nUniversity (then a school of homeopathy), she decided in the negative.\r\nIn this connection, she says:\r\n\r\n It is my opinion that if we do not intend to lower our aims or to\r\n descend from the position which we have taken and which we should\r\n uphold, we cannot form any connection, through the admission of its\r\n students to our Hospital, with a school which holds itself strictly\r\n sectarian and which claims a one-sided knowledge--a faith in medicine\r\n which has no warrant, and an advancement in science which neither\r\n here in America nor abroad is approved by natural scientists, by\r\n chemists, or by microscopists. And which in reality possesses no sound\r\n foundation other than that which exists in all new ideas, namely,\r\n that of experiment. But this experiment is just as permissible to the\r\n regular practitioner who is educated on the broadest terms and who has\r\n a perfect right to administer any remedy for the restoration of health.\r\n\r\n In stating this opinion, to which I have given thoughtful\r\n consideration, I regret personally that I thus exclude women of a\r\n school with which I agree as to the great principle of equality in\r\n education of the sexes.\r\n\r\nAt one time, there seemed to be in the minds of some of the later\r\nmembers a question as to the reciprocal relation of the medical staff\r\nand the board of directors. On this occasion, she writes:\r\n\r\n Our Hospital is utterly different from all hospitals carried on by the\r\n City or the State or by private individuals and endowments.\r\n\r\n In these latter there exists either a need to provide for the\r\n helpless who are dependent on the Commonwealth, or benevolent persons\r\n wish to provide a charity and so they establish hospitals. In both\r\n conditions, the staff of physicians is employed by those who manage\r\n the institutions and, consequently, either money or thanks are due to\r\n such physicians as serve.\r\n\r\n With us, it is entirely different. None of our original directors\r\n wanted a hospital; none of them was inspired by charity or had the\r\n means to provide such charity. I, the representative of an idea in its\r\n earliest evolution--I sought those Directors that they might serve\r\n the purpose of carrying out that idea.\r\n\r\n They served then and in the future the women physicians connected with\r\n the Hospital. They never dictated as to the number of physicians or\r\n internes; they never proposed to enlarge the work; this has always\r\n been done by the professional staff. _We_ thank _them_ for\r\n their generous aid, but they cannot thank us for doing much or little.\r\n\r\n Of course, the Directors are the corporate body, and they represent\r\n us legally before the public; but they carry out our ideas, not we\r\n theirs. They simply stand ready to support the principle of giving to\r\n women physicians full opportunity to manifest their skill and judgment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is interesting to refer to a letter regarding\r\nanother matter, which Mrs. Cheney wrote to Dr. Zakrzewska in 1888. Mrs.\r\nCheney says:\r\n\r\n I hope you will not think me ungrateful for your inestimable frank\r\n criticism, which has been one of the greatest helps in my life even\r\n if I cannot adopt all your suggestions, as I must speak my own\r\n language--but I am most thankful for the matter you have supplied.\r\n\r\n I never know what to say about my relation to the Hospital work. It is\r\n not to me what it is to you.... I accepted it as blessed work ... and\r\n have thanked you all my life for bringing it to me, but it has never\r\n been mine as it is yours.\r\n\r\nOther aspects of her mind appear in connection with special\r\nexperiences, as when she writes to one of the other doctors regarding\r\na question of hospital discipline:\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR DOCTOR:\r\n\r\n I enclose the letter you handed to me and one from Dr. ----. Allow\r\n me to tell you how I have managed such letters. I have had precisely\r\n three similar experiences. Dr. ----’s patients left in the same way as\r\n Mrs. ----, and to this day their relatives are not satisfied that the\r\n patients were treated rightly. Still, they are good friends with me in\r\n spite of my having acted as I did. This was what I did.\r\n\r\n When I received the first letter, I said to myself:\r\n\r\n 1. There are always two sides to every story.\r\n\r\n 2. I cannot act at all if I keep this letter secret, as I am requested\r\n to do.\r\n\r\n 3. If there is an accusation, I must have the excuse unless I want to\r\n ignore the whole concern and burn the letter.\r\n\r\n 4. I will not talk, so as not to run the risk of losing my temper.\r\n\r\n Therefore, I sat down, wrote a note to the doctor and enclosed the\r\n letter of accusation, but requested her not to let either the patient\r\n or the student know about it but to tell me what she thought was best\r\n to be done.\r\n\r\n Now this action seemed right to me, because\r\n\r\n 1. I investigated the other side.\r\n\r\n 2. I tried to put things to rights.\r\n\r\n 3. I gave a chance for explanations.\r\n\r\n 4. I could not become impatient, because both parties are always more\r\n careful when things are put on paper.\r\n\r\n After I received the doctor’s reply, I took the letters, the patient\r\n and the doctor into a private room, and informed them why and how\r\n I had acted in the affair. Then I read both letters, and this was\r\n followed by an apology on both sides and the matter was ended.\r\n\r\n Then, although the patient left the Hospital, she could not say that\r\n the doctor was not courteously treated by me. Nor could she say that\r\n justice was not done to her.\r\n\r\n After this, the doctor and I together had an interview with the\r\n student, and we said as little or as much as was necessary to make her\r\n more careful, and that was ended.\r\n\r\n As it happened, Dr. ----’s patient was one of more education and she\r\n saw that she was in the wrong, so she apologized and remained until\r\n the doctor discharged her.\r\n\r\n I don’t think that either you or I are the last authority on such\r\n questions. They should be settled with all concerned in harmony and\r\n even with polite treatment of the culprit, should there be one.\r\n\r\n If you lose your temper with a coworker, it lowers you in the eyes of\r\n patients or of others a great deal more than it hurts her. Everybody\r\n feels with or for the punished one, and nobody with the one who\r\n punishes or condemns.\r\n\r\n I find that in going through the wards now, all the patients feel\r\n attached to the doctor and are full of her praise, and they hope she\r\n will have a good time and come back to her arduous duties with her\r\n usual strength, fine spirits and cheerfulness.\r\n\r\n As soon as Dr. ---- comes home, we shall work out rules for the\r\n physicians so that these will be ready for our next meeting. And if\r\n they are then properly discussed, I think it might be a good plan\r\n to have them printed in our report so that patients may learn their\r\n extent and on whom they depend.\r\n\r\nAgain, one of the doctors was evidently suffering from a wounded\r\n_amour propre_, feeling that she had not been treated with\r\nsufficient consideration. She had apparently expressed her grievance\r\nto Dr. Zakrzewska, and then being dissatisfied with the result of her\r\ninterview, had tried to express herself more definitely in a letter.\r\nDr. Zakrzewska replies:\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR DR. ----:\r\n\r\n I will answer the last paragraph of your letter first, because this\r\n is the straw which shows how the wind blows, and it also confirms my\r\n impression concerning the cause of your manner. I have nothing to\r\n forgive in your manner because, personally, you have never offended\r\n me. I therefore have nothing to forget either.\r\n\r\n But forgetting that we are colleagues and professional women\r\n interested in the same work and in the same great cause where harmony\r\n is so desirable, you seem to think, or rather you assert, that I\r\n should remember your years and your condition of health, which is to\r\n account for your speaking without thinking....\r\n\r\n Now about your age, I never have thought of you as young even when\r\n you were young. At the time we met, I recognized in the instant the\r\n genuine talent and fervor of purpose of which you were possessed, and\r\n I accepted you not as an inferior but as an equal.\r\n\r\n Do you think that I could now make an attempt to throw the mature\r\n woman from a past and from a place in my estimation which I let her\r\n occupy when she was really a young girl of no experience? Would not\r\n this be silly and mean? Do you admit that I am either, or both?\r\n\r\n I always saw your weaknesses and faults as clearly as I see them now,\r\n and I often spoke plainly of them to you, but I never, never thought\r\n of putting you lower on account of them, because weaknesses we all\r\n have, and I am glad to bear and forbear with these in people who have\r\n something of worth to counterbalance, or else to place these faults\r\n entirely in the background.\r\n\r\n You say you wish to preserve an opinion of your own on all Hospital\r\n matters. Who has ever wished more than I have that you would do this?\r\n How often have I said to you when you wished to make changes and have\r\n told me that you put these on me and my orders, that my shoulders were\r\n broad enough to carry all, but that I thought you should do things\r\n on your own authority as this seemed simply right. How often have I\r\n referred to you as being a more efficient authority on those points\r\n regarding which I thought you were.\r\n\r\n And even when you did not agree with my propositions, when did you\r\n ever hear that I complained? On the contrary, have I not the more\r\n readily yielded and tried to investigate honestly which way would be\r\n best? “Do as you please,” “suit yourself,” “work in your own way”--are\r\n not these standing phrases which I have used to every physician?\r\n\r\n I am ready to give up the Hospital work at any moment that you all\r\n think you can do without me. I have no ambition to _work_ in\r\n it; I had only the ambition to help women into the position where\r\n _they_ could work. And this I have accomplished.\r\n\r\n In New York I did well, and I am remembered in an honorable and\r\n friendly way. And here in Boston I have certainly done my best. And\r\n if there are now a hundred women who differ from me and a thousand\r\n who know better than I do, I have nothing to say against it. On\r\n the contrary, I am glad and happy about it because this is just the\r\n condition which I strove for. My teachings have always been--you must\r\n all do better, far better, than I have done, because you have far\r\n better opportunities than I had. I helped to make those opportunities\r\n and shame upon you if you do not come out better than your present\r\n teacher.\r\n\r\n No, no, my dear Doctor, it is not at all anything of this that is in\r\n your manner. In some way you have got it into your head and heart that\r\n you must play the first fiddle, or still better, be the conductor and\r\n show your importance in every way, small and big. You want the incense\r\n of having everybody look up to you as the most important person in the\r\n concern; you like to patronize, and so on.\r\n\r\n And I, to tell the truth, am very willing that you should have all\r\n this pleasure because I do not care at all for these things. To me,\r\n the answer to one of the great questions of the time is to assist\r\n women into their right position whether or not they know me or my name\r\n (which, luckily, is so hard that they won’t even take the trouble to\r\n learn it).\r\n\r\n Now, this will be the last time that I shall write on this subject.\r\n There is no use in trying to make artificially a harmony which does\r\n not any more come spontaneously. I am very willing, yes, even too\r\n willing, to allow myself to be overruled, because I do not care at all\r\n for the particular minutæ.\r\n\r\n You know that I carried on the Hospital quite differently from Dr.\r\n ---- or Dr. ----, yes, even from what you did, but I never tried,\r\n nor wanted to try, to interfere, because it is far better that each\r\n individual should do her work in her individual way. Otherwise, it\r\n must fail to be done well. Imitations are always inferior to the\r\n genuine article. But agreeing to a thing is not always liking it.\r\n\r\n As for my having wounded your feelings, this is possible--but I\r\n daresay it was only in hospital matters when forced out by your\r\n hostile manner. I hope I never was rude in my social relations, and if\r\n I have been let me assure you that if you will tell me when and where\r\n I was so, I will certainly beg your pardon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n _Dr. Zakrzewska’s private life--Her home--Her friends--Her keeping\r\n in touch with the Hospital doctors, students and internes--Her\r\n “boys”--Her ethics--Her reading--Men physicians who served as\r\n consultants at the New England Hospital._\r\n\r\n\r\nConcurrently with the public manifestations of Dr. Zakrzewska’s life,\r\nas recorded in the preceding pages, proceeded her more intimate life\r\nof home, family and friends. Allusions to these happy possessions have\r\nbeen made from time to time, but a particular word should be given to\r\none feature which she brought with her from the old world to the new--a\r\nfeature which enriches life over there, and which would add so much to\r\nour American life could we adopt it as generally and as simply.\r\n\r\nReference is here made to the custom of European people of all grades\r\nof circumstance in incorporating the outdoors into the daily life of\r\nthe household, especially for the hour or moment of social relaxation.\r\n\r\nPoor indeed the family that has not at least a tiny arbor, or shelter,\r\nor shaded spot, where the glass of sirup or other beverage of the\r\ncountry, or the cup of coffee or tea, or the incense of the friendly\r\npipe or the more exclusive cigar, draws the curtain upon the workaday\r\nworld and releases the spirit for a few moments’ dream of content.\r\n\r\n“Rock Garden” was the name of her most blessed retreat--a large garden\r\nwith terraces and with the rocks for which Roxbury is famous. There\r\nwere trees and shrubs, fruits and flowers, tables and seats, and the\r\nair was filled with memories of happy hours, hospitable days and\r\nfriendly meetings. And many groups of Hospital directors, doctors and\r\ninternes, as well as other friends, gathered there at various times,\r\ncarefree and festive.\r\n\r\n“Rock Garden has always been the Garden of Paradise,” comes a voice\r\nborne upon the breeze, “but wherever you are or wherever you make your\r\nhome, that place will soon be ideal to your friends.”\r\n\r\nDr. Buckel writes from the gardens of California, her thoughts turned\r\nback to Rock Garden:\r\n\r\n Oh, what has it not been! You know what it has been to you, but you do\r\n not know how dear it is to other hearts. I almost feel as if it ought\r\n to be set apart as a place sacred to friendship and to all the sweet\r\n memories associated with it.\r\n\r\n ... Christmas at Rock Garden always comes to me as a beautiful memory\r\n of generous hearts and joyous greetings. How plainly I can see\r\n you holding up the packages and reading off the names in your own\r\n inimitable manner, while the big stocking stands yearning to give up\r\n its treasures.\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n ... I always think of Rock Garden and the Christmas tree there and how\r\n much I enjoyed it, and how dear are the memories. All the Heinzens,\r\n Miss Sprague, Dr. Morton, the Prangs, Dr. Berlin, the Drs. Pope, and\r\n others, are all fresh in my mind, and I send them kind greetings,\r\n with love to Santa and your own dear self.\r\n\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison at one time described this home which Dr.\r\nZakrzewska had there created for herself and for the friends and\r\npatients who were her paying guests. He said:\r\n\r\n Dr. Zakrzewska was already settled in her attractive home in Cedar\r\n Street, Roxbury, when, in 1864, my father moved to Highland Street\r\n near by, and the two families became intimate. Although unmarried, the\r\n Doctor rarely failed to have a house full of friends and relatives,\r\n making of her home a social center for her German and American\r\n acquaintances.\r\n\r\n She was a woman of decided opinions and the frankest speech, a\r\n circumstance which gave zest and animation to any group in which she\r\n mingled. She held firmly to the conviction that personal consciousness\r\n ends with death; that so-called spiritual communications are a\r\n delusion, that prohibition laws infringe upon individual rights; that\r\n homeopathy has no claim to science; and that armed resistance to\r\n tyrants is justifiable.\r\n\r\n My father held diametrically opposite views, but as both were\r\n believers in the utmost freedom of speech, the social clash of arms\r\n never engendered a moment’s ill feeling. They were closely united upon\r\n the questions of anti-slavery and woman’s rights, and they were drawn\r\n by a common impulse to progressive and philanthropic movements.\r\n\r\n Karl Heinzen, who with his wife and son made a part of the Doctor’s\r\n household, was a striking and remarkable figure. He was a man of\r\n massive intellect, possessing a high reputation in Germany as a writer\r\n of both prose and verse. His intense love of liberty and hatred\r\n of shams had made him an exile in America in the tumultuous years\r\n preceding the Civil War. He was of noble stature and frame, a spacious\r\n temple for a great soul, his rugged face betraying his indomitable and\r\n fearless character. Boston never realized the value or distinction of\r\n this moral hero, for the reason that the English language was more\r\n formidable to him than despots and monarchies. But in Dr. Zakrzewska\r\n he had a friend who appreciated his noble talents and virtues.\r\n\r\n ... I have dwelt upon this conjunction of the Doctor with Karl Heinzen\r\n because his influence upon her life was deep and abiding. To see him\r\n working about the ample grounds, trimming the grapevines and attending\r\n to the fruit trees--his recreation and pleasure--and, when the weather\r\n permitted, to behold the afternoon table-gathering under the leafy\r\n shade at the back of the grounds which rose above the house, was to\r\n receive the impression of a bit of the Fatherland--a German grafting\r\n on a Yankee hillside. The glimpse was often through or over the board\r\n fence which separated my own house on the hilltop when, in 1868, I\r\n became the Doctor’s closely adjacent neighbor. What animated talk\r\n enlivened the coffee, and how many friends enjoyed first and last the\r\n retirement and refreshment!\r\n\r\n In the early days, sweet Mrs. Severance and her interesting family\r\n lived also on Cedar Street; the Prangs were near at hand on Center\r\n Street; the Koehlers and the Elsons were in the vicinity. The\r\n beautiful suburb of Roxbury was then full of natural charm, an object\r\n of interest to strangers visiting Boston and at that date untouched\r\n and unspoiled.\r\n\r\n I remember a traveled friend pointing down Cedar Street towards the\r\n Doctor’s house and asking, “Have you ever been to Versailles?” adding,\r\n “The arches of these glorious elms are a reminder of it.”\r\n\r\nFor many years Dr. Zakrzewska had a summer cottage at York Harbor but\r\nit is of her busy city homes that her friends wrote most often.\r\n\r\nOne of the former internes writes to her in later days:\r\n\r\n The year spent by me in the Hospital will always be remembered with\r\n great pleasure, particularly that part of it when I was quarantined\r\n at the Maternity and you used to ask me down to dinner at your house\r\n nearly every evening.\r\n\r\nShe kept in touch with all the doctors and students who had been at\r\nany time connected with the Hospital, if writing only at notable times\r\nsuch as the big anniversaries or when some special report or Fair\r\nsouvenir was published. She always inquired how they were getting on,\r\nand whether they received the annual reports of the Hospital which were\r\nalways sent to their latest address. And so she was kept informed of\r\ntheir changing circumstances, their successes or discouragements, their\r\nmarriages, their husbands, their children, and their problems of many\r\nkinds.\r\n\r\nIn beginning practice they had the varied fortunes which might be\r\nexpected from differing individualities, equipment, resources and\r\nenvironment. Some found doors already opened to welcome them; some had\r\nto make places for themselves. One of the latter group writes to her:\r\n\r\n I am now doing very satisfactorily but I often think how prophetic\r\n you were when you used to warn us, saying, “Five years of waiting and\r\n starvation are before every one of you.”\r\n\r\nTheir addresses were scattered all over the world--over the United\r\nStates from Maine south to Florida and west to California; on the north\r\nto Canada; and east and west to England, Scotland, France, Germany,\r\nSwitzerland, Italy, India,[23] Persia, Japan, China.\r\n\r\nIn keeping with the breadth of view which characterized her and her\r\ndirector associates, no discrimination has ever been made at the New\r\nEngland Hospital regarding sects, races or nationalities in students,\r\ndoctors, nurses or patients.\r\n\r\nAs we have already seen, Dr. Zakrzewska had always a large circle of\r\nfriends among the famous and high-minded men of her time, and her\r\ninfluence with the men in the families of her patients has also been\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nIt remains to add a word as to the number who were proud to call\r\nthemselves her “boys.” A specimen letter from one of these latter,\r\nsigned by a name well known in Boston, says:\r\n\r\n  DEAR DOCTOR:\r\n\r\n As no person in the world outside of my own immediate family is dearer\r\n to me than yourself, I want you to be one of the first to know of my\r\n engagement to ---- ----, and I am sure you will approve of my choice.\r\n\r\n Trusting that we may meet before long, I am as ever one of your boys.\r\n\r\nShe had no theologic affiliations. Her clear vision and her keen\r\nreasoning powers were unsatisfied with any form of dogma, creed or\r\nritual yet elaborated. And she found these latter unnecessary to\r\nthe development of a rule of life which reconciled the untrammeled\r\nintellect and the highest ethics yet evolved by an upward-struggling\r\nhumanity.\r\n\r\nShe was able to organize instinct, training, reason, observation,\r\nexperience and personal association, and to add to these the communion\r\nwith the great minds of the race which is to be derived from\r\nreading--each continually checking up and correcting all the others. So\r\nshe developed a mind which she kept in a wholesome state of flux, ready\r\nto modify any conclusion as new light rose above the horizon.\r\n\r\nShe held her course and steered her life as a skilled navigator holds\r\nhis course, who while he steers by compass and chart yet makes myriad\r\nadjustments as required by continually varying conditions of wind and\r\nwave and sky.\r\n\r\nAnd pursuers of high ideals in ethics and philosophy were always on\r\nher list of friends. This list always included clergymen, and in this\r\nconnection we may note the observations at a later date of Rev. Charles\r\nG. Ames. He says:\r\n\r\n Dr. Zakrzewska in speaking of the class of unfortunate women with\r\n whom she was often brought in contact in her medical work, once said\r\n to me, “I cannot give them money but I always give them my friendship\r\n in order to keep them morally alive.” It made me think of Fichte’s\r\n words, “No honest mind is without communication with God, whether so\r\n called or not.” After hearing that remark of the Doctor’s, I never had\r\n any difficulty in giving her my fellowship on the deepest spiritual\r\n ground.\r\n\r\nReverend James Freeman Clarke[24] was one of her earliest friends in\r\nBoston, their acquaintance beginning back in the days when she came\r\nsoliciting help for opening the New York Infirmary.\r\n\r\nIn her address at the opening of the Sewall Maternity new building, in\r\n1892, Dr. Zakrzewska alludes to this episode, saying:\r\n\r\n Let me express the gratitude we owe for our existence to a man whose\r\n influence secured to us the noble friends who in the spirit of justice\r\n to women gave invaluable assistance with their labors and their\r\n financial help--I mean, Reverend James Freeman Clarke.\r\n\r\n I feel justified in saying that it was among the members of his church\r\n that the idea was materialized and that funds for the beginning of the\r\n experiment were provided.\r\n\r\nWe have referred above to Dr. Zakrzewska’s wide reading. One of the\r\nfriends of her Cleveland days, Rev. A. D. Mayo, says:\r\n\r\n By an intuitive grasp of what was best for herself in books, she\r\n realized the saying of the historian, George Bancroft, “I should as\r\n soon think of eating all the apples on the big tree in my garden as\r\n to read the whole of any good book. I pluck and eat the best apple\r\n and leave the rest.” She always knew the best apple on every tree of\r\n knowledge, and her mind was stored with the condensed wisdom of many\r\n libraries.\r\n\r\nAnd he tells of the renewal in Boston of his friendship with her, some\r\ntwenty years after its beginning in Cleveland:\r\n\r\n Having made Boston my family headquarters, we were brought together in\r\n her generously appointed home in Union Park, almost under the eaves of\r\n the great church of Dr. Edward Everett Hale. I then verified anew the\r\n old truth that a genuine friendship grows even during absence.\r\n\r\nWriting at this same date about Dr. Zakrzewska’s personality, Dr.\r\nBuckel says:\r\n\r\n I cannot measure how much I owe to her skillful, energetic, practical\r\n instruction as a physician when I was a student in the New York\r\n Infirmary; neither can I measure the strength, courage and hope which\r\n her bright example has given me throughout my life.\r\n\r\n I think, however, that her genuine respect for even the very poorest\r\n of the poor immigrants who crowded the most wretched quarters of\r\n New York made the deepest and most lasting impression. Others\r\n showed sympathy and pity, but she entered into their lives with an\r\n appreciation of their difficulties and a coöperation in their honest\r\n efforts that stimulated their courage and gave them strength to work\r\n on until success finally rewarded them.\r\n\r\n She considered the husband, father, son, and brother equally worthy of\r\n regard with the women of the family in all her plans for improvement.\r\n Although devoted to women’s best interests, she never worked for\r\n women alone. Her influence over the men in these poor families was\r\n most remarkable, considering their supposed opinions as to the proper\r\n sphere of woman.\r\n\r\n Not a few educated, intelligent men owe their first start in the world\r\n to her suggestive counsel. The spirit of comradeship she felt with\r\n high-minded, intellectual men greatly strengthened my own convictions\r\n as to the true relations of men and women to each other and helped me\r\n to enjoy more freely the friendship of men whom I honored and admired.\r\n\r\n In her social life, gentlemen were always most cordially welcomed,\r\n and they seemed sincerely to appreciate her kindness and highly value\r\n her esteem. The picnics and excursions she planned to the suburbs\r\n and parks of New York, which were then easily accessible, are among\r\n the most delightful memories of my life. Grave professors, exiled\r\n philosophers and learned doctors ran with us in our merry games and\r\n forgot for the moment all but the gladsome spirit of the play.\r\n\r\n During my long association with Dr. Zakrzewska in hospital life,\r\n both in Boston and in New York, I do not remember a single\r\n misunderstanding. I always had her cordial support in the hospital\r\n and a bright, warm welcome in her home. And I knew that any of our\r\n students whom I might take to her house would also receive a cordial\r\n welcome and realize that she was their friend.\r\n\r\nFor so many years after its beginning the New England Hospital was so\r\nlargely regarded as a personal expression of Dr. Zakrzewska, and its\r\nplace in the estimation of the profession was so largely based upon\r\nappreciation of the standards of which she stood as a representative,\r\nthat the acceptance by a man physician of a position on the consulting\r\nstaff was really a personal tribute to her.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it seems desirable to publish here the names of all\r\nthe men who during her life served the Hospital in a consulting\r\ncapacity--whether as physician, surgeon or other specialist--the names\r\nbeing placed in chronological order.[25]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n _Opening of the new Dispensary building (the Pope Dispensary)--Dr.\r\n Zakrzewska speaks of the relation of the Dispensary to confidence\r\n in women surgeons--The new surgical building (the Ednah D. Cheney\r\n Surgical Building)--Dr. Zakrzewska’s remarks on the progress of\r\n the woman physician as demonstrated by these added new buildings\r\n (made more complete later by the Kimball Cottage for the Children’s\r\n Department)--Celebration of her seventieth birthday by a reception\r\n and by the naming of the original main building “The Zakrzewska\r\n Building”--Fatigue of this reception emphasized the failing health\r\n which had already caused her retirement from private practice--Her\r\n characteristic acceptance of the inevitable--Her death--Her funeral\r\n services--Her farewell message. (1896-1902.)_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIE E. ZAKRZEWSKA, M.D. (1896)]\r\n\r\nIn 1896, Dr. Zakrzewska again refers to the confidence of the community\r\nin women surgeons, illustrating it by an experience which she relates\r\nin her address at the opening of the new Dispensary building (Pope\r\nDispensary--donated by Colonel Albert A. Pope and named for the donor\r\nand his twin sisters, Drs. Augusta and Emily Pope) which was located on\r\nthe site of the old one at No. 29 Fayette Street. She says:\r\n\r\n Our Dispensary in especial serves another purpose, namely, to\r\n convince rich and poor, educated and uneducated, professionals and\r\n nonprofessionals that women physicians can serve the community at\r\n large as well as can men physicians.\r\n\r\n Said an Irishman to me a few weeks ago, when I pronounced it necessary\r\n for a member of his family to undergo a serious operation and advised\r\n further consultation with other physicians, “Can’t we have one of the\r\n women surgeons from your Hospital?”\r\n\r\n Seeing my surprise at this proposition, as the man was by no means an\r\n educated person, he said, “Well, Doctor, when I came to this country\r\n with my wife, we were very poor and knew nothing. The good women of\r\n the Pleasant Street Dispensary attended to us and taught us to take\r\n care of ourselves. All our children were born under their care, and\r\n they watched that we did right by them, all without any charge. Now\r\n that we can afford good pay, I am sure we want the same, for I swear\r\n by the women doctors.” This speech, delivered in good broad Irish\r\n brogue, made me laugh most heartily. I soon had the case in the hands\r\n of the proper attendant, and all went well.\r\n\r\n So, friends, let us be proud of all we have done, with the promise to\r\n do more and better work as science advances.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1899, on Mrs. Cheney’s seventy-fifth birthday, the cornerstone\r\nof the new surgical building (the Ednah D. Cheney Surgical Building)\r\nwas laid. In an address made at that time, Dr. Zakrzewska says:\r\n\r\n After fifty years of experimental agitation and practical work, we\r\n now are completing the third department of the medical art in laying\r\n the cornerstone for this building. The medical pavilion,[26] the\r\n maternity, and now the surgical pavilion are the proofs in brick and\r\n mortar of woman’s independent and faithful performances in the medical\r\n profession.[27]\r\n\r\n The confidence of the public which generously provided the means for\r\n this cause, the confidence of the sick who sought relief at the hands\r\n of the women physicians, and the attitude of the profession in general\r\n towards the woman practitioner--all these have been acquired through\r\n skillful and patient labor.\r\n\r\n It would be affectation if we women physicians did not feel proud\r\n of the result which we now see materialized, grateful as we are to\r\n all those who in earlier years bore with us not only the doubt and\r\n opposition but also the ridicule of our attempts. While we remember\r\n those who have done their part so valiantly, we do not forget those\r\n who have passed away without having had the satisfaction which we now\r\n enjoy in the success of our early effort.\r\n\r\nOn September 6, 1899, she celebrated her seventieth birthday, and on\r\nOctober 24, as stated in the annual report:\r\n\r\n The Hospital tried to do honor to the one who, more than all others,\r\n deserves to be honored--its senior physician, Dr. Zakrzewska. In her\r\n thought, the New England Hospital was born. Because of her zeal and\r\n untiring energy and the aid of a few earnest friends, it became a\r\n fact. And from that day to the present one, as wise woman, skillful\r\n physician, and faithful friend, she has been an inspiration to all.\r\n\r\n A reception was tendered her by the Hospital at the home of Mrs.\r\n Thomas Mack and there, with Mrs. Cheney to assist, she greeted her\r\n many friends, old and new.\r\n\r\n That the Hospital shall always bear an evident sign of its originator,\r\n it has been decided to name the main building which was the first one\r\n built, “The Zakrzewska Building,” and to have it suitably marked by a\r\n tablet.\r\n\r\nThe exhausting excitement of this celebration aggravated the nerve\r\nfatigue which had been hanging out warning signals for many years,\r\nand to which attention has been called in these pages. At last these\r\nadmonitions had become peremptory, and at last the high-spirited\r\nphysician was obliged to confess herself subject to the laws regarding\r\nwhich she had so often cautioned her patients.\r\n\r\nA study of her symptoms would in these days lead to a diagnosis of\r\narteriosclerosis, that sad, sure reaction that waits inevitably upon\r\nthe over-strenuous life, whether this follows the spur of the inward\r\nurge or the whip of circumstance. In the earlier days of medical\r\npractice, when symptoms of this condition were most in evidence through\r\ncerebral manifestations, the diagnosis of an obscure and fatal nervous\r\ndisease was made, and so it was in this case.\r\n\r\nThe keen-sighted patient realized that her ailment was progressive,\r\nthat it might be palliated though not cured, and that the imperative\r\ntreatment lay in a simplified mode of life with avoidance of care,\r\nanxiety and excitement.\r\n\r\nSo she retired from the last detail of private practice, put her\r\naffairs in order, even arranging her funeral service, and then she\r\ncheerfully turned her mind to bearing her discomforts philosophically\r\nand to making the best of the time which remained.\r\n\r\nWhen the realization of the finality of her situation came to her,\r\nshe was undoubtedly shaken (when the final summons comes, every\r\nnormal-minded human being quivers, even if it be only for the moment),\r\nbut she was not dismayed. Subconsciously her physical condition must\r\nhave aroused compensatory instincts, as it does with all of us, for at\r\none time she wrote:\r\n\r\n Death is to me a good friend. Whenever it comes, it is welcome. So\r\n many of my contemporaries have gone and are going into Nirvana, the\r\n world becomes young daily and new to me, into which newness I can\r\n hardly find myself. So that, when I say, “I have enough,” I say the\r\n truth.\r\n\r\nBut additional acceptance of her position was favored by the serenity\r\nwhich comes to a mind which had long recognized the inevitable\r\nlimitations which time would some time bring, for she writes:\r\n\r\n For some years I have been saving money for old age, and in fact, I\r\n have done what I have so often encouraged other women to do--become\r\n independent of friends and charity. I have arranged to be independent\r\n until eighty years--to which age I sincerely hope not to live.\r\n\r\nShe seldom spoke of herself or of her feelings, but at one time she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n If it were not for my poor head, I would say I was in better health\r\n than for years. But, alas! the nervous centers refuse to recuperate\r\n and the least excitement renders me sleepless, and a host of regrets,\r\n reproaches and condemnations rise up like demons to torment me.\r\n\r\nThen, in one of the characteristic remissions of the condition, she\r\nwrites, with one of her customary glints of humor:\r\n\r\n I intend to live another seventy years because life seems so well\r\n worth living.\r\n\r\nOnce she wrote more in detail to Mrs. Cheney, because, as she said:\r\n\r\n ... It seems to me right that my dearest and oldest friend should\r\n understand me and not misjudge my actions.... Years ago some confusion\r\n of mind warned me of trouble to come, and it finally set in in the\r\n form of noises in my head. I scolded myself for being so nervous in my\r\n behavior while being irritated by these sounds, and I went gladly to\r\n California, hoping to get benefit by diversion.\r\n\r\n However, the two distinct noises on the top of my head kept increasing\r\n so that even the noise of the cars did not drown them. Still I forced\r\n myself to act cheerfully and was determined not to be hopeless. Little\r\n by little, however, indifference toward events, then toward people,\r\n and now toward the beauty of nature, has crept upon me.\r\n\r\n I have spoken to Dr. Berlin about this noise and described it as a\r\n steady sound of falling rain which prevented my falling asleep, to\r\n which she replied, “Well, we do fall asleep even if it rains hard,\r\n and so will you.” I do not care to talk with other physicians, as I\r\n have made a study of brain trouble more than anything else and can\r\n therefore advise myself. Besides, talking about it increases the\r\n nervous irritation. So please take this as it is written, in cool\r\n reason--it is an inevitable condition which must be braved.\r\n\r\nLess than three years were left to test her fortitude. She grew\r\nsteadily weaker and on May 12, 1902, her release came. After a night of\r\nrestlessness and intense discomfort she fell asleep, never waking again\r\nbut passing at sunset into the Silence.\r\n\r\nOn a beautiful afternoon, the closing scene was laid in the chapel of\r\nthe Forest Hills Crematory, and the details were as she had arranged.\r\nShe had requested that no flowers should be used--she who so loved\r\nNature and all the lovely growing things--and in this her friends\r\nrespected her wishes. But they could not be denied the tribute of green\r\npalms and wreaths of laurel.\r\n\r\nThere was no music, no service in the ordinary terms. Her older\r\nfriend--William Lloyd Garrison--having gone before, his son of the same\r\nname and her younger friend, made a short introductory address. And\r\nthen Mrs. Emma E. Butler, secretary of the board of directors of the\r\nHospital, read the farewell letter which Dr. Zakrzewska had written for\r\nthe occasion:\r\n\r\n During my whole lifetime, I have had my own way as much as any\r\n human being can have it without entirely neglecting social rules or\r\n trespassing upon the comfort of others more than is necessary for\r\n self-preservation.\r\n\r\n And now, upon this occasion, I wish to have my own way in taking leave\r\n of those who shall come for the last time to pay such respect as\r\n custom, inclination and friendship shall prompt, asking them to accept\r\n the assurance that I am sorry to pass from them, this time never to\r\n return.\r\n\r\n While these words are being read to you, I shall be sleeping a\r\n peaceful, well-deserved sleep--a sleep from which I shall never arise.\r\n My body will go back to that earthly rest whence it came. My soul will\r\n live among you, even among those who will come after you.\r\n\r\n I am not speaking of fame, nor do I think that my name, difficult\r\n though it be, will be remembered. Yet the idea for which I have\r\n worked, the seeds which I have tried to sow here and there, must live\r\n and spread and bear fruit. And after all, what matters it who prepared\r\n the way wherein we walk? We only know that great and good men and\r\n women have always lived and worked for an idea which favored progress.\r\n And so I have honestly tried to live out my nature--not actuated by an\r\n ambition to be somebody or to be remembered especially, but because I\r\n could not help it.\r\n\r\n The pressure which in head and heart compelled me to see and to think\r\n ahead, compelled me to love to work for the benefit of womankind in\r\n general, irrespective of country or of race. By this, I do not wish\r\n to assert that I thought of all women before I thought of myself. Oh,\r\n no! It was just as much in me to provide liberally for my tastes, for\r\n my wishes, for my needs. I had about as many egotistical wants to be\r\n supplied as has the average of womankind.\r\n\r\n To look out for self and for those necessary to my happiness, I always\r\n considered not only a pleasure but a duty. I despised the weakness of\r\n characters who could not say “No” at any time, and thus gave away\r\n and sacrificed all their strength of body and mind, as well as their\r\n money, with that soft sentimentality which finds assurance in the\r\n belief that others will take care of them as they have taken care of\r\n others.\r\n\r\n But, in taking leave, I cannot pass by those who, in every possible\r\n way in which human beings can assist one another, have assisted me by\r\n giving me their true friendship. Of my earliest career in America, Dr.\r\n Elizabeth Blackwell has been the most powerful agent in strengthening\r\n what was weak in me; while shortly afterward, my acquaintance with\r\n Miss Mary L. Booth fed the enthusiasm kindled by Dr. Blackwell and\r\n strengthened me in my uphill path. The friendship of these two women\r\n formed the corner stone upon which I have built all my life long.\r\n\r\n To many valuable friends in New York I owe a deep gratitude, and\r\n especially to Mrs. Robert G. Shaw of Staten Island. In Boston, I\r\n leave a great number of friends, without whom I never could have\r\n accomplished anything and who have developed my character as well as\r\n faculties dormant within me of which I was unaware. It is the contact\r\n with people of worth which develops and polishes us and illuminates\r\n our every thought and action.\r\n\r\n To me the most valuable of these early friends were Miss Lucy Goddard,\r\n Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, Mrs. George W. Bond, Mrs. James Freeman Clarke,\r\n Mrs. George R. Russell, Dr. Lucy E. Sewall and Dr. Helen Morton--not\r\n that I give to them a place higher than to others, but because I am\r\n fully conscious how deeply they affected my innermost life and how\r\n each one made its deep imprint upon my character.\r\n\r\n I feel that whatever work may be ascribed to my hand could not have\r\n been done without them. Although I could not number them in the list\r\n of other friends who, in a special sense, formed a greater part of my\r\n life’s affections, still I owe to each and every one a great debt. And\r\n I wish now, whether they be still alive or in simple tribute to their\r\n memory, to tell them of my appreciation of their kindness.\r\n\r\n To those who formed the closer family circle in my affections--Mr.\r\n Karl Heinzen, Miss Julia A. Sprague, and my sisters--I have tried to\r\n show my gratitude during the whole of my life, on the principle of\r\n Freiligrath’s beautiful poem:\r\n\r\n  O Lieb, so lang du lieben kannst;\r\n  O Lieb, so lang du lieben magst;\r\n  Die Stunde kommt, die Stunde kommt,\r\n  Wo du an Grabern stehst und klagst.\r\n\r\n And now, in closing, I wish to say farewell to all those who thought\r\n of me as a friend, to all those who were kind to me, assuring them\r\n all that the deep conviction that there can be no further life is an\r\n immense rest and peace to me. I desire no hereafter. I was born; I\r\n lived; I used my life to the best of my ability for the uplifting of\r\n my fellow creatures; and I enjoyed it daily in a thousand ways. I had\r\n many a pang, many a joy, every day of my life; and I am satisfied now\r\n to fall a victim to the laws of nature, never to rise again, never to\r\n see and know again what I have seen and known in my life.\r\n\r\n As deeply sorry as I always have been when a friend left me, just so\r\n deeply sorry shall I be to leave those whom I loved. Yet I know that\r\n I must submit to the inevitable, and submit I do--as cheerfully as a\r\n fatal illness will allow. I have already gone in spirit, and now I am\r\n going in body. All that I leave behind is my memory in the hearts of\r\n the few who always remember those whom they have loved. Farewell.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPerhaps she is right. Perhaps in the ordinary egoistic sense in\r\nwhich the word is used, there is no such thing as Immortality.\r\nNevertheless--_the spirit of Marie E. Zakrzewska still lives_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTERWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe personal quest of Marie E. Zakrzewska is ended. The land of\r\ndispossession and refusal has been penetrated by many small parties\r\nunder her and other leadership, and many outposts have been established\r\nand are being valiantly held.\r\n\r\nBut the battle which she faced and fought is not ended. It remains for\r\nall lovers of justice to sustain the impulsion which carried her on and\r\nso to continue the fight till the truth of her watchword, “Science has\r\nno sex,” is acknowledged. Then, and only then, will her life’s work be\r\nfulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn medicine, many doors of opportunity have been opened as the result\r\nof her life and the lives of her sister pioneers. But as with her and\r\nwith them, the struggle persists around the hospitals. Many if not most\r\nof the great medical schools are now open to women but to-day, even as\r\nin Dr. Zakrzewska’s day, the attainment of the degree of M.D. is only\r\nthe beginning of medical knowledge.\r\n\r\nOpportunities for hospital study and training are needed not only\r\nfor the subsequent year of interneship, but as a constant resource\r\nall through the professional life. With a few exceptions, these\r\nopportunities are not yet open to women, and women are to-day hampered\r\nby this exclusion even more than they were in the past.\r\n\r\nWith the modern expansion of the science and art of medicine and the\r\nincreasing elaboration of the required appliances and methods of\r\nexamination, hospitals have become great centers of laboratory and\r\nclinical investigation and research. And the physician who is not able\r\nto form contact with some such center is crippled and is compelled to\r\ndo his work either imperfectly or at the cost of tremendous additional\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\nThis is the reason why we have just said that the opening of all\r\nhospital opportunities to women on equal terms with men is yet more\r\nimperative to-day than it was when Dr. Zakrzewska made such valiant\r\nbattle for her sisters.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, when women seem to have attained opportunities, they\r\nstill find it necessary to remember Dr. Zakrzewska’s distrust and fear\r\nof beguilement, to remain on guard and to take all possible steps to\r\nkeep secure all that has been so painfully achieved.\r\n\r\nEven among nonmedical students and in circles that are supposed to be\r\nthe most broadly educated, here and there the tolerances and amenities\r\nof civilized life develop slowly. Thus as late as October 20, 1921,\r\nthe students of the University of Cambridge (England) express their\r\ndisapproval of even “limited membership” for women by the old, worn-out\r\nmethods of mobbing and rioting--battering down and smashing the\r\nvaluable memorial gates of the women’s college, Newnham. The arrival of\r\nthe police prevented their further progress there, but at Peile Hall,\r\nthey reached the doors and tried to force entrance into the college\r\nitself, which further outrage was again prevented by the police.[28]\r\n\r\nIn 1922 the London Hospital decided to exclude women from the classes\r\nand services to which they had been admitted since 1908. The story\r\nhas a familiar sound--“... the chairman emphasizes the fact that the\r\nstep has not been brought about by any failure of the women students\r\n... who have done very well in every way, in work, in conduct, and in\r\ndiscipline.”[29]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the handicaps imposed on woman, she has\r\ndemonstrated that “science has no sex.” Do not her opponents now need\r\nto demonstrate that they themselves are worthy followers of science by\r\naccepting truth wherever it may be found and by rendering impartial\r\njustice to every one?\r\n\r\nAs some of these pages are being written (June 21, 1921), Madame Marie\r\nCurie is in Boston.\r\n\r\nThe morning papers report that she was yesterday given a reception\r\nby Harvard University. President Lowell presided, and in his address\r\nhe ranked Madame Curie with “Sir Isaac Newton and other epoch-making\r\ndiscoverers.” He then introduced Professor Richards of the Department\r\nof Chemistry, who said, “The discovery of Madame Curie gave the world\r\nnew ideas concerning the structure of the universe, and opened a new\r\npath of thought to scientists.”\r\n\r\nThe highest mark of distinction which a college or university can\r\nbestow upon a person whom it desires to honor is an honorary degree.\r\nAt its Commencement, three days later, Harvard did not confer an\r\nhonorary degree on Madame Curie. Would it have conferred one on Sir\r\nIsaac Newton?\r\n\r\nIs scholarship, then, the ideal of a college or university? Or is it\r\nscholarship which happens to be attained by a sex?\r\n\r\nBut humanity is neither male nor female: it is both. And both possess\r\nall human faculties _plus_ the specialized qualities of the sex\r\nof the individual. The nonrecognition of this basic fact impedes the\r\nprogress of the race. And the subjection of either sex to the other\r\nimpedes both.\r\n\r\nHence, an appeal for justice to women, such as is embodied in this life\r\nof Marie E. Zakrzewska, is equally an appeal for justice to men. The\r\nman who would hold woman in subjection is himself held in subjection.\r\nFor\r\n\r\n  “The woman’s cause is man’s: they rise or sink\r\n  Together, dwarf’d or godlike, bond or free:\r\n  For she that out of Lethe scales with man\r\n  The shining steps of Nature, shares with man\r\n  His nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,\r\n  Stays all the fair young planet in her hands--\r\n  If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,\r\n  How shall men grow?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This statement and related ones throughout the autobiographical\r\nchapters are the only references to her family history made in this\r\nconnection by Dr. Zakrzewska.\r\n\r\nA “Memoir of Dr. Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska, issued by the New England\r\nHospital for Women and Children, Boston, 1903,” quotes her as writing\r\nto a friend, “I am in reality as family-proud as any aristocrat can\r\npossibly be, but I prefer to be remembered only as a woman who was\r\nwilling to work for the elevation of Woman.” This Memoir further says:\r\n\r\n The Polish family of Zakrzewski of which her father and grandfather\r\n were in the line of direct descendants, is one of the most ancient in\r\n Europe and traces its history back to 911. It is named among the most\r\n powerful aristocratic “republican families of agitators” of Poland,\r\n and fell with Poland’s downfall.\r\n\r\n The princely family property--which consisted according to some\r\n accounts of ninety-nine villages--was confiscated, the main portion\r\n falling into Russia’s hands in 1793. At that time Marie’s grandfather\r\n saved his life by flight beyond the border, having seen his father\r\n fall on the field of battle and his mother and other members of the\r\n family perish in the flames of their castle.\r\n\r\n Writing of the family history, a brother of Marie states: “Ludovico\r\n was the name written under the coat of arms which I often held in my\r\n hands as a boy, and Ludwig was the name borne by every eldest son of\r\n the family until 1802. When our father was born on November 11--St.\r\n Martin’s Day--his mother, a good Catholic, added Martin to the name\r\n of Ludwig.” His father (Marie’s grandfather) was, however, the first\r\n one of the Zakrzewski family to leave the Catholic church. He became\r\n not only a Protestant but a very liberal thinker.\r\n\r\n The family history on the mother’s side is traced back only to the\r\n middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\n Marie Elizabeth Sauer, the great-grandmother of Marie, for whom she\r\n was named, was a Gypsy Queen of the Lombardi family. She was said\r\n to be “the most lovely of women, very beautiful and energetic.” Her\r\n father was a surgeon and was attached to the army of Frederick the\r\n Great during the Seven Years’ War. His daughter accompanied him in his\r\n work as assistant surgeon. Among those whom she attended was a Captain\r\n Urban. He had been wounded in the chest and she removed the ball. Upon\r\n his recovery they were married, much to the delight of her father,\r\n as Captain Urban belonged to the same Gypsy tribe of the Lombardi.\r\n Nine children were born to them, five daughters and four sons. They\r\n were all of unusual size, the daughters almost six feet tall, with\r\n hair flowing down to their feet; the sons seven feet tall and of\r\n perfect stature. Marie’s grandmother was the middle one of these nine\r\n children, and became a veterinary surgeon. She had three daughters one\r\n of whom was the mother of Marie.\r\n\r\n[2] “The undersigned, Secretary of Legation of the United States\r\nof America, certifies that Miss Marie Elizabeth Zakrzewska has\r\nexhibited to him very strong recommendations from the highest\r\nprofessional authorities of Prussia, as a scientific, practical,\r\nexperienced _accoucheuse_ of unusual talent and skill. She has been\r\nchief _accoucheuse_ in the Royal Hospital of Berlin, and possesses a\r\ncertificate of her superiority from the Board of Directors of that\r\ninstitution. She has not only manifested great talent as a practitioner\r\nbut also as a teacher; and enjoys the advantage of a moral and\r\nirreproachable private character. She has attained this high rank over\r\nmany female competitors in the same branch; there being more than fifty\r\nin the city of Berlin who threaten by their acknowledged excellence to\r\nmonopolize the obstetric art.\r\n\r\n  THEO. S. FAY.\r\n\r\n  Legation United States, Berlin, Jan. 26, 1853.\r\n  (SEAL)\r\n\r\n Upon inquiry I find that instead of fifty there are one hundred and\r\n ten female _accoucheuses_ in Berlin.\r\n\r\n  THEO. S. FAY.\r\n\r\n[3] Apparently Dr. Zakrzewska had no information as to the details of\r\nraising the money which was loaned to her for defraying her living\r\nexpenses while at the medical college.\r\n\r\nIn _Glances and Glimpses_, the source of such financial assistance\r\nis suggested by Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, who visited Cleveland in 1854.\r\nShe speaks of the first Medical Loan Fund Association. She also speaks\r\nof the Ohio Female Medical Education Society, and quotes from the\r\nconstitution of this latter an article referring to the repayment of\r\nloans.\r\n\r\nDr. Hunt further speaks of traveling to other towns in Ohio, lecturing\r\non the study of medicine by women, and “establishing loan fund\r\nassociations auxiliary to the Cleveland association.” She particularly\r\nmentions Elyria (where Mrs. Severance also spoke), Tiffin, Columbus,\r\nCincinnati, and Yellow Springs.\r\n\r\n[4] Elsewhere, Dr. Zakrzewska says:\r\n\r\n In the beginning of the first winter I was the only woman; after the\r\n first month another was admitted; and during the second winter there\r\n were three besides myself who attended the lectures and graduated in\r\n the spring.\r\n\r\n[5] This attitude of the clerical profession, persisting at least as\r\nlate as 1857, is also referred to by Professor Joseph P. Remington\r\nin the report of an address published in the _American Journal of\r\nPharmacy_, January, 1911.\r\n\r\n[6] Speaking of the visit made to Cleveland at this time, Dr. Hunt\r\nstates in _Glances and Glimpses_:\r\n\r\n In December, 1854, I started for Ohio, being desirous to understand\r\n the medical question in that State.... I had only heard that Marie was\r\n a student at the Cleveland College; but when I met her I felt that\r\n here was a combination of head and heart which was as uncommon as it\r\n was beautiful.... Further acquaintance has but deepened my interest\r\n in Marie, and Dr. Blackwell of New York must feel it a privilege to\r\n have been the means of her introduction at Cleveland as a medical\r\n student, where her noble bearing and scientific mind are perceived and\r\n acknowledged by the faculty....\r\n\r\n I attended lectures one day on a class of diseases peculiar to women,\r\n and not one shade of levity or impropriety diminished the interest of\r\n the occasion. Men and women studying together at a medical college\r\n of high standing was prophetic. I spoke with the professor after the\r\n lecture and he remarked, “We are more democratic in Ohio than you\r\n are in Massachusetts.” I felt like hanging my head. The Athens of\r\n America was eclipsed by a younger sister; yet I rejoiced greatly that\r\n as the elder was unprepared to advance, the junior tripped her up\r\n triumphantly, stepped over her, and took the first prize.\r\n\r\n ... I thought it best to visit the towns in the northern part of Ohio\r\n and try to elicit interest in the medical question by establishing\r\n loan fund associations.\r\n\r\n[7] Mary L. Booth later earned a reputation as historian and as\r\ntranslator, and was the editor of _Harper’s Bazar_ from its\r\nbeginning in 1867.\r\n\r\n[8] The first Board of Directors (nineteen in number) was made up\r\nalmost entirely of women who were serving on the Board of Lady Managers\r\nfor the Clinical Department of the New England Female Medical College\r\nin 1861-1862, the last year of Dr. Zakrzewska’s connection with that\r\ncollege. Her resignation at the end of that year caused that department\r\nto be discontinued and the services of the Lady Managers to be no\r\nlonger in request by the college.\r\n\r\nTo the number of Lady Managers who transferred their interest to the\r\nnew Hospital were added on the Board of Directors several men, one\r\nbeing the former leading trustee of the college, Hon. Samuel E. Sewall.\r\n\r\nThis historic first Board of Directors was finally constituted as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Mrs. Mary C. E. Barnard\r\n  Miss Sarah P. Beck\r\n  Geo. Wm. Bond\r\n  Mrs. Louisa C. Bond\r\n  Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney\r\n  Mrs. Anna H. Clarke\r\n  Miss Mary J. Ellis\r\n  Mrs. Lucretia G. French\r\n  Miss Lucy Goddard\r\n  Fred. W. G. May\r\n  Mrs. Joanna L. Merriam\r\n  Mrs. Mary A. S. Palmer\r\n  Thomas Russell\r\n  Mrs. Caroline M. Severance\r\n  Samuel E. Sewall\r\n  John H. Stephenson\r\n  James Tolman\r\n  Mrs. Mary G. White\r\n  Dr. Marie E. Zakrzewska\r\n\r\n[9] Later, Dr. Mary E. Breed, who was graduated from the New England\r\nFemale Medical College and had been a student under Dr. Zakrzewska at\r\nthe New York Infirmary, became resident physician, and Miss Anita E.\r\nTyng and Miss Lucy M. Abbott, who had been her students at the New\r\nEngland Female Medical College, were student assistants. Dr. John Ware\r\nconsented to serve as consulting physician and Dr. Samuel Cabot as\r\nconsulting surgeon.\r\n\r\n[10] Karl Heinzen is thus described by the Boston _Evening\r\nTranscript_:\r\n\r\n He was a native of Prussia and came to America in January, 1848, as an\r\n exile, having been banished from Germany on account of a book which\r\n he published on the _Civil Service of the Prussian Government_,\r\n which showed that, instead of the promised constitutional government,\r\n a complete net of absolutism was extending over every province of\r\n Prussia.\r\n\r\n On the breaking out of the revolution of 1848 in France and Germany,\r\n he left America in May to participate in the movement in Europe; after\r\n its suppression he was again exiled, going first to Switzerland and\r\n afterwards to England. But in 1850 he again came to America which has\r\n since been the scene of his labors.\r\n\r\n On his arrival he found almost the entire German population in the\r\n Democratic and pro-slavery party; he therefore established here the\r\n first anti-slavery German newspaper. This exposed him to severe\r\n persecutions by the Democrats, so that his life was threatened in New\r\n York City and in Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\n He was also the first among the German-Americans to advocate woman\r\n suffrage.\r\n\r\n Since 1858 he has lived in Boston, and during this time he has stood\r\n on terms of firm friendship with William Lloyd Garrison who frequently\r\n translated Mr. Heinzen’s articles for the _Liberator_.\r\n\r\n Mr. Heinzen was the most radical thinker whom the Germans in America\r\n possess. Besides editing for more than twenty-five years a newspaper,\r\n _The Pioneer_, he has published a number of valuable books on\r\n political, philosophical and social subjects.\r\n\r\n[11] Dr. Tyng had been a student at the New England Female Medical\r\nCollege under Dr. Zakrzewska, later a resident student at the New\r\nEngland Hospital and then a graduate of the Philadelphia medical\r\nschool--this school now becoming established on a more stable\r\nfoundation and having changed its name from the Female Medical College\r\nof Pennsylvania to the Woman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[12] Dr. Thompson was a graduate of the New England Female Medical\r\nCollege, studying for two years under Dr. Zakrzewska. Later she\r\nreceived an honorary degree from the Woman’s Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania. The Chicago Hospital for Women and Children which she\r\nfounded was afterwards named the Mary Thompson Chicago Hospital for\r\nWomen and Children.\r\n\r\nIn an affectionate letter to Dr. Zakrzewska in later years, Dr.\r\nThompson rallies this former teacher on her frank remarks when trying\r\nto goad the students of the New England Female Medical College to\r\nbetter work, saying:\r\n\r\n I wished to tell you of our work here that you might know that we\r\n are doing something more than “the ordinary run of nurses,” I having\r\n heard it remarked in times past that that was all we would amount\r\n to. That did not stimulate me in the least to this kind of work. But\r\n I will tell you what did--it was the actual love of surgery and the\r\n witnessing many men operate when I felt that I could do quite as well\r\n as they did. Since writing you, my third case of ovariotomy has done\r\n well.\r\n\r\n[13] Dr. Buckel was graduated in Philadelphia and then served under\r\nDr. Zakrzewska as resident student at the New York Infirmary. During\r\nthe last two years of the Civil War she rendered efficient service in\r\nthe United States military hospitals of the Southwest, earning the\r\nsoubriquet of “The Little Major.” _The Survey_, May 17, 1913,\r\nsays: “She selected and supervised the nurses, kept records in the\r\nabsence of clerks, wrote letters for sick soldiers, obtained furloughs\r\nfor convalescents, and comforted the dying.” In the year 1865-1866, she\r\nsucceeded Dr. Ruth A. Gerry as assistant physician at the New England\r\nHospital, the latter returning to the practice which she had already\r\nstarted at Ypsilanti, and beginning to share in the long fight for the\r\nadmission of women to the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n[14] After receiving her degree of M.D. at Berne, Dr. Sophia Jex-Blake\r\nreturned to Great Britain and was largely instrumental in establishing\r\nthe London School of Medicine for Women and in obtaining hospital\r\nfacilities for it. She has reported her experience in _Medicine as\r\na Profession for Women_ and in _Medical Education of Women_.\r\nCharles Reade makes extensive use of both of these articles in writing\r\nhis novel _The Woman Hater_.\r\n\r\n[15] Dr. Morton was a classmate of Dr. Sewall when both were students\r\nof Dr. Zakrzewska at the New England Female Medical College. She had\r\nspent four years in study at the Paris Maternité during the last two of\r\nwhich she had served as assistant teacher.\r\n\r\nShe returned to Boston in 1867 to begin the practice of her profession.\r\nShe then became connected with the New England Hospital, her first\r\nappointment being on the staff of the Dispensary. Here she became the\r\nsuccessor of Dr. Zakrzewska, the latter resigning from this branch of\r\nthe work and leaving it entirely to the constantly growing number of\r\nyounger medical women.\r\n\r\n[16] (p. 355) There are two great causes of sickness in our lying-in\r\nwards. First, mental distress during pregnancy, caused by poverty or\r\nneglect; second, the exposure and fatigue which many endure before\r\ncoming to us.\r\n\r\nOne young girl, late last fall, had been sleeping for a week in\r\nouthouses. Another came in the cold winter weather, after wandering\r\nin a bewildered condition in the streets with wet skirts and no\r\nstockings, searching for some place of shelter in her distress. Another\r\nwhen she entered was very sick with acute pleurisy and pneumonia, so\r\nthat even before her delivery her life was threatened. Several cases\r\nof intermittent fever and one of typhus fever were admitted under\r\nsuch circumstances that we could not avoid taking them without being\r\nguilty of inhumanity. Two women in a comatose condition from puerperal\r\nconvulsions were also taken in. One of these last was restored to\r\nhealth, while the other never recovered consciousness.\r\n\r\nWe have taken in several babies who were so poisoned with patented\r\nnostrums that only the most vigorous treatment with antidotes could\r\nrouse them, and weeks of the most assiduous nursing were necessary to\r\nrestore their enfeebled vitality.\r\n\r\nSome of you saw in one of the wards the wretched little creature who\r\nwas brought by its mother to us in a comatose state, with the skin\r\ndrawn loosely over its bones and its half-closed glassy eyes sunk\r\ndeeply in their sockets. This child had been boarded out by its mother\r\nwhile she worked at service, and it had been gradually declining until\r\nat the age of three and one-half months, it weighed but seven and\r\none-half pounds.\r\n\r\nThis was an extreme case, but frequently a practiced eye will detect\r\nthe same process going on. Often when I am called to a sick child, I\r\nrecognize in the ashy hue, sunken eyes and other well-known symptoms,\r\nthe work of some “soothing syrup” or other equally pernicious drug.\r\nPitiful indeed is the fate of babies deprived of their natural\r\nguardians and subjected to the influence of these infamous nostrums.\r\n\r\nCan we not find some means to secure to infants a mother’s care and\r\nlove for at least the first year of their lives, by furnishing these\r\nmothers with some honest means of support, and thus saving both mothers\r\nand children? I leave this important question for you to consider, for\r\neven if it is not strictly part of our work, it is a sequel to one\r\ndepartment of our Hospital.\r\n\r\nA young woman, who in her childhood lost her mother and whose\r\nstepmother not only kept a house of ill-fame but sent this daughter to\r\nanother, has now a beautiful baby to which she is so strongly attached\r\nthat, in spite of the evil influences of all her past life, she is\r\nwilling to do even the hardest work for the sake of keeping her baby\r\nwith her. Yet, only a few evenings ago she came, with her blue-eyed\r\nbaby sweetly smiling in the soft wrappings provided by its fond mother,\r\nand said that she must give it up. “Nobody,” she said, “would take\r\n_her_ with her baby,” and I saw the hard look in her eyes and the\r\nbitter smile that made me tremble for her future, though I am confident\r\nthat she had the will and the strength to earn her living honestly.\r\n\r\nLast winter we were called to attend a woman in a difficult and\r\ncomplicated labor. She lived in a dark basement with floor wet and\r\nbroken, the scanty bedcovering eked out by her husband’s old coat\r\n(which he himself needed) and the small pile of coal on the floor being\r\nthe only comforts visible except the stove. Cold, faint and hungry,\r\nthis woman had suffered for hours. When she was safely delivered,\r\npublic charity could not make her comfortable--it was private\r\nbenevolence that gave her blankets, sheets, clothing and care.\r\n\r\nAnother case of recent occurrence shows how insufficient is the law to\r\ntake care of the sick. A woman in one of the worst localities in the\r\ncity who was beaten by her drunken husband and turned out of doors,\r\nwas seized with premature labor in the streets and found her way into\r\nthe house of a neighbor. This neighbor, Mrs. M., who was nearly blind,\r\nsupported by her daily earnings herself and an interesting little boy\r\nwhom she had taken from the city crier’s to nurse and whom she had kept\r\nwith her rather than send him to Tewksbury.\r\n\r\nMrs. M. allowed the woman to stay, and on the third day I was sent\r\nfor and found her in an almost dying condition. It was late Saturday\r\nevening, and there was neither food nor fuel in the house. The woman\r\nwas too ill to be removed, no aid could be obtained from the city\r\nbefore Monday, and then the legal allowance would be only two dollars\r\nin groceries and one dollar in money. Clothing, a bed and a nurse were\r\nabsolutely needed. These were provided by private charity and the\r\nwoman recovered, though it was said that three different physicians\r\nwho were called in by the neighbors had declined to attend her as they\r\nconsidered it useless under such adverse circumstances to attempt to\r\nsave her.\r\n\r\nThe first time this woman stepped out of doors she walked from the\r\nNorth End to the Hospital to see if we could not get work for her.\r\nHer husband, who had been released from the jail where he had been\r\nkept awaiting the result of her illness, had visited her and told her\r\nhe should do nothing more for her. Also, Mrs. M., who had given her\r\nshelter, was about to be turned out of her rooms because she had not\r\nbeen able to work as usual to earn her rent.\r\n\r\nIt is true that all these sufferers were drunkards, but I mention their\r\ncases to show how the Hospital leads us into every path of reform.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish permanent good, it is necessary to remove\r\nthe causes of evil. For this reason, we are deeply interested in\r\nevery effort to dispel ignorance, promote temperance, and banish\r\nlicentiousness and other vices, for all these have a direct influence\r\non health or disease. We frequently find it necessary not only to watch\r\nover the individual case of illness but to see that the whole tenement\r\nis cleaned and ventilated; or, when this is impossible, we sometimes\r\nsucceed in removing the whole family to a more healthful locality away\r\nfrom their old associates and the low, drinking saloons.\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that our students have a large field of labor open\r\nto them--every woman whom we help to educate not only adds one to the\r\nband of workers but strengthens our position and enlarges our means\r\nof usefulness. Hence, it is all-important that we gain every possible\r\nadvantage for our students, and it is hard to see denied to them the\r\nvaluable opportunities so freely offered to young men in this city, for\r\nwe feel that the very best America affords comes far short of our wants.\r\n\r\n[17] The new Hospital is described in the annual report:\r\n\r\n Although within the bounds of the city, thus giving the advantages of\r\n water, gas and the other conveniences of city life, the land is very\r\n high and commands an extensive and beautiful view of Jamaica Plain,\r\n Roxbury and Brookline. It is also easily accessible both by horse and\r\n steam cars, and seems to combine all the important requisites of good\r\n air, light and easy access at a moderate price.\r\n\r\n The beautiful exterior of the building is due to the taste and skill\r\n of our architects, Messrs. Cummings and Sears, who have successfully\r\n grappled with the problem of designing a hospital which shall be\r\n beautiful in proportion, form and color, and so contribute to the\r\n pleasure of all connected with it, without sacrificing either interior\r\n comfort or economy of means.\r\n\r\n The excellence of the interior arrangements, especially of the wards\r\n and the nurses’ rooms (which differ from those of any hospital known\r\n to the Committee), is due to the Women Physicians who, having learned\r\n from long experience the needs of their patients, have striven to meet\r\n them by arrangements at once simple and ingenious.\r\n\r\n Our first object was to secure an entire isolation of the lying-in\r\n patients from those of the medical and the surgical wards, so as to\r\n guard against all possible danger of infection passing from one to\r\n the other. This has been effected by a separate house, called the\r\n “Maternity Cottage” for the lying-in patients.\r\n\r\n In this building, the two stories are so arranged that one can be\r\n thoroughly cleansed and aired while the other is in use. Our plan\r\n contemplates a second similar building as soon as our means will\r\n enable us to construct it. Then, in case of any threatened danger, one\r\n house can be entirely isolated, while all new patients are taken to\r\n the other. In this way, we can increase our Lying-in Department to any\r\n desirable extent without incurring the dangers attendant upon large\r\n hospitals.\r\n\r\n The next consideration was to get as much sunlight as possible into\r\n the patients’ rooms and to give the nurses, who are all human beings\r\n and need to be cared for as well as others, good airy rooms in which\r\n to take their rest when rest is possible to them. For this reason, all\r\n the medical wards have been placed on the back of the house, which\r\n looks nearly south.\r\n\r\n Each ward consists of two rooms--one for two beds and one for\r\n four--with a nurse’s room between. The nurse can thus often have the\r\n benefit of the solitude and quiet of her own room and yet be so close\r\n to her patients that nothing can escape her notice. A bathroom, also\r\n enjoying the sunshine, separates the two wards and can be used by the\r\n patients of either. These light, airy, sunny wards with their open\r\n fireplaces seem more like the rooms of a pleasant home than the dreary\r\n apartments of a hospital.\r\n\r\n The house does not square exactly with the points of the compass, and\r\n the northern side is touched by the sun during some part of the day,\r\n thereby securing it from dampness. The eastern surgical ward projects\r\n beyond the other part of the house, and so gains a southern window for\r\n light and cheerful sunshine. A similar projection on the western side\r\n makes a pleasant parlor for the patients.\r\n\r\n The rest of this side of the house is occupied by the patients’\r\n admission room, tea kitchen, etc., in which sunshine is not so\r\n important.\r\n\r\n The Children’s Ward, in the upper story, is a new feature of which we\r\n have long felt the want. It is large, airy and convenient.\r\n\r\n The furniture of the wards was mainly provided by individuals and by\r\n various churches and societies in the city and vicinity. The wards\r\n were named after the donors, who promised to keep them in order and\r\n in repair, the names to be retained as long as the rooms were thus\r\n sustained.\r\n\r\n[18] Dr. Dimock had been a student in the Hospital in 1867. As was\r\nthe case with several other students, she thus at the beginning of\r\nher medical life came under the teachings of Dr. Zakrzewska. We may\r\njudge of the trend of these teachings from what Dr. Zakrzewska writes\r\nelsewhere as to her advice to Dr. Sewall when the latter wished to\r\nbegin the study of medicine. She says:\r\n\r\n“I advised her to lay a foundation by first studying natural\r\nhistory--biology, comparative physiology and microscopical anatomy.”\r\nAnd we are already familiar with the convictions of Dr. Zakrzewska that\r\nEurope at that time offered both to men and women better opportunities\r\nfor a medical education than did the United States.\r\n\r\nSusan Dimock differed from these other students in that she had more\r\ninitiative, or more self-dependence, or less fear of circumstance and\r\nconvention, or some other temperamental quality. Or perhaps it was\r\nthe financial situation--that great lion in the path of women not\r\ntrained in self-support--that she felt she could control, through Dr.\r\nZakrzewska and other friends.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the resulting reaction of Dr. Zakrzewska’s teaching upon\r\nthis temperament was such that Susan Dimock decided to go abroad\r\nfor her entire medical course, to study there and to be graduated\r\nthere--almost the first American woman to take such a radical step, and\r\none of a lengthening procession of women from many countries who were\r\ndriven into temporary exile by their ambition to qualify themselves for\r\ntheir chosen profession, having found the best opportunities at home\r\nreserved for the exclusive use of their brothers.\r\n\r\nShe entered the University of Zurich, and after completing the required\r\nfive years of study, received her degree, returning to Boston as the\r\nnew building of the Hospital was in course of erection. She had paid\r\nparticular attention to surgery and was intending to specialize in that\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\n[19] Dr. Keller was a graduate of the Woman’s Medical College of\r\nPennsylvania and she had been attending physician at the Woman’s\r\nHospital in Philadelphia. She had also had considerable surgical\r\nexperience in hospital and private practice.\r\n\r\n[20] The New England Hospital Medical Society, later the New England\r\nWomen’s Medical Society.\r\n\r\n[21] Dr. Call was a student of the Hospital and later was graduated at\r\nthe head of her class in the University of Michigan. She then spent a\r\nyear studying in Europe before beginning work at the Dispensary.\r\n\r\n[22] The twin sisters, Drs. Augusta and Emily Pope, after being\r\ngraduated at the New England Female Medical College, went to Europe to\r\nstudy for an additional year, becoming connected with the Dispensary on\r\ntheir return. Both later received an honorary degree of M.D. from the\r\nWoman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n[23] Among the internes whose address in India was, unfortunately, not\r\nfor long, was the charming Dr. Anandabai Joshee, the first Hindoo woman\r\nto seek medical education in America, and who had been graduated at the\r\nWoman’s Medical College of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nComing to Boston in the summer of 1886, she served only a short time\r\nwhen her health failed. She returned to India to become physician in\r\ncharge of the Female Ward of the Albert Edward Hospital in Kolhapur,\r\nbut she died from tuberculosis a few months later, before reaching her\r\ntwenty-second birthday.\r\n\r\n[24] Dr. Clarke was a member of the board of trustees of the New\r\nEngland Female Medical College when Dr. Zakrzewska became a member\r\nof the faculty. He resigned this trusteeship when she resigned from\r\nthe faculty, and his wife, Mrs. Anna H. Clarke, became a member of\r\nthe board of directors of the New England Hospital which was founded\r\nimmediately thereafter.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clarke remained a member of the board of directors until her\r\ndeath in 1897. Their daughter, Miss Lilian Freeman Clarke, was always\r\ninterested in the Hospital and, as already stated, she assisted in\r\norganizing in connection with the Maternity the first hospital social\r\nservice work in America.\r\n\r\n[25] (p. 467)\r\n\r\n   1.

This was named for Miss Helen Kimball and\r\nfor her father, Moses K. Kimball, who was a staunch supporter of the\r\nHospital. Mrs. Cheney became president in 1887, upon the resignation of\r\nMiss Lucy Goddard, the first president, and continued in office till\r\n1902 when she resigned and was succeeded by Miss Kimball.\r\n\r\n[27] An interesting note in connection with the new Surgical Building\r\nwas the receipt through Dr. Zakrzewska of a contribution of five\r\nhundred dollars towards its construction, from one of her classmates at\r\nthe Cleveland Medical College, Dr. Cordelia A. Greene, then established\r\nat Castile, N.
