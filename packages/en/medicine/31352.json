MORROW\r\n\r\nWHOSE GREAT FAITH IN THE ESSENTIAL GOODNESS OF HUMAN\r\nNATURE LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROBLEMS OF\r\nSEX HAVE ARISEN FROM IGNORANCE AND\r\nTHAT EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO\r\nTHEIR SOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFATORY NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the lectures printed in this volume have formed the basis of a\r\nseries given at Teachers College, Columbia University, during the\r\nsummer sessions of 1914 and 1915, and during the academic year\r\n1914-1915. Others were addressed to parents, to groups of men, to\r\nwomen's clubs, and to conferences on sex-education. In order to avoid\r\nextensive repetition, there has been some combination and rearrangement\r\nof lectures that originally were addressed to groups of people with\r\nwidely different outlooks on the sexual problems.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago the late Dr. Prince A. Morrow announced that a volume\r\ndealing with many of the timely topics of sex-education was to be\r\nprepared by the undersigned with the advice and criticism of a\r\ncommittee of the American Federation for Sex-Hygiene; but even before\r\nDr. Morrow's death it became evident that this plan was impracticable.\r\nThree members (Morrow, Balliet, Bigelow) of the original committee\r\ncollaborated in a report presented at the XV International Congress on\r\nHygiene and Demography. Since that time the writer, working\r\nindependently, has found it desirable to reorganize completely the\r\noriginal outline announced by Dr. Morrow.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with a declaration made voluntarily in a conversation\r\nwith Dr. Morrow, the author considers himself pledged to devote all\r\nroyalties from this book to the movement for sex-education.\r\n\r\nAmong the many persons to whom is due acknowledgment of helpfulness in\r\nthe preparation of this book, the author is especially indebted for\r\nsuggestions to the late Dr. Prince A. Morrow, to Dr. William F. Snow,\r\nSecretary of the American Social Hygiene Association, and to Dr. Edward\r\nL. Keyes, Jr., President of the Society of Sanitary and Moral\r\nProphylaxis; for constructive criticism, to his colleagues, Professor\r\nJean Broadhurst and Miss Caroline E. Stackpole, of Teachers College,\r\nwho have read carefully both the original lectures and the completed\r\nmanuscript; and to Olive Crosby Whitin (Mrs. Frederick H. Whitin),\r\nexecutive secretary of the Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis,\r\nwho has suggested and criticized helpfully both as a reader of the\r\nmanuscript and as an auditor of many of the lectures delivered at\r\nTeachers College.\r\n\r\n                                                           M.A.B.\r\n\r\n    TEACHERS COLLEGE,\r\n  COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY,\r\n    December 28, 1915.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n   I.

SOME BOOKS FOR SEX-EDUCATION                                 238\r\n\r\n      INDEX                                                        249\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE MEANING, NEED, AND SCOPE OF SEX-EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 1. _Sex-education and Its Relation to Sex-hygiene and Social Hygiene_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of sex-education.]\r\n\r\nSex-education in its largest sense includes all scientific, ethical,\r\nsocial, and religious instruction and influence which directly and\r\nindirectly may help young people prepare to solve for themselves the\r\nproblems of sex that inevitably come in some form into the life of\r\nevery normal human individual. Note the carefully guarded phrase \"help\r\nyoung people prepare to solve for themselves the problems of sex\", for,\r\nlike education in general, special sex-education cannot possibly do\r\nmore than help the individual prepare to face the problems of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More than sex-hygiene.]\r\n\r\nNow, sex-education as thus defined is more extensive than sex-hygiene,\r\nwhich term was originally applied to instruction concerning sex.\r\nSex-hygiene obviously refers to health as influenced by sexual\r\nprocesses, and as such it is a convenient subdivision of the science of\r\nhealth. It would be quite satisfactory as a name for popular\r\ninstruction concerning sex if that were strictly, or even primarily,\r\nhygienic; but in a later lecture it will be shown that the most\r\ndesirable sex-instruction is only in a minor part a problem of hygiene.\r\nI realize that this statement may be declared heretical by many of the\r\npresent-day advocates of sex-hygiene, because they have approached this\r\nlatest educational movement from the standpoint of physical health, and\r\nespecially because their attention has been drawn to the very common\r\noccurrence of pathological conditions. Nevertheless, the sexual\r\nproblems of our times do not all affect physical health, which hygiene\r\naims to conserve; and the sex-educational movement will be quite\r\ninadequate without great stress upon certain ethical, social, and other\r\naspects of sex. Young people need instruction that relates not only to\r\nhealth but also to attitude and to morals as these three are influenced\r\nby sexual instincts and relationships. This idea will be developed\r\nlater, but I anticipate here simply to suggest the point of view of the\r\nstatement that \"sex-hygiene\" is altogether too limited as a general\r\ndesignation for the desirable instruction concerning sex. The continued\r\nuse of the term \"sex-hygiene,\" now that the scope of the desirable\r\nsex-instruction has been extended far beyond the accepted limits of the\r\nscience of health, is tending to cause confusion. The educational\r\nproblems will be more definite and the support of the intelligent\r\npublic more assured if we limit the use of \"sex-hygiene\" to the\r\nspecific problems of health as affected by sexual processes and cease\r\ntrying to make it include those phases of sex-instruction which have\r\nnothing directly to do with health.\r\n\r\nTwo general terms, \"sex-instruction\" and \"sex-education,\" are available\r\nas all-inclusive designations of the desirable instruction concerning\r\nany aspects of sex. They are quite free from the above objections to\r\n\"sex-hygiene,\" and it is highly desirable that they should be used in\r\nall educational discussions where there is no specific reference to the\r\nproblems of health. Sex-hygiene will be used in these lectures only\r\nwhen there is some direct reference to health as influenced by the\r\nsexual functions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social hygiene.]\r\n\r\nSocial hygiene in its complete sense means the great general movement\r\nfor the improvement of the conditions of life in all lines in which\r\nthere is social ill health or need of social reform; but it is often\r\nlimited to the sexual aspect of the unfortunate and unfavorable\r\nconditions of life, and it has been proposed to adopt the term \"social\r\nhygiene\" as a substitute that avoids the word \"sex\" in sex-hygiene. For\r\nthis reason it has been incorporated into the names of several\r\nsocieties that are interested in sex-hygiene (_e.g._, the American\r\nSocial Hygiene Association). Probably the relation of sex-hygiene to\r\nthe so-called \"social evil\" has suggested the use of social hygiene in\r\nits most limited sense. It will be unfortunate if this usage becomes so\r\nprominent that we think of the health problems of society as chiefly\r\nsexual, for the larger outlook of Ellis's \"Task of Social Hygiene\" is\r\ndesirable. Likewise, the phrase \"social evil\" in the sense of sexual\r\nevil misleadingly suggests that the only evil of society is the sexual\r\none, but this evasive designation is being supplanted by the more\r\ndefinite and franker word \"prostitution.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that \"social hygiene\" as a substitute for\r\n\"sex-hygiene\" is narrower in that it does not include the personal\r\nproblems of health as affected by sexual processes. This is a serious\r\nomission, for certainly all sex-hygiene taught before the later\r\nadolescent years should be personal and not social.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Phases of sex-education.]\r\n\r\nThe relation of sex-hygiene or social hygiene as a limited phase of\r\nsex-education is shown by the following outline:\r\n\r\n                       { sex-hygiene (personal, | for sexual health\r\n                       { social)                |\r\n                       {                        |\r\n                       { biology (including     | for attitude\r\n                       { physiology) of         | regarding sex,\r\n                       { reproduction           | and for important\r\n                       {                        | scientific facts\r\n                       {                        |\r\nIn the broadest        { heredity and eugenics  | for sexual conduct\r\noutlook, sex-education {                        | leading to race\r\n(or sex-instruction)   {                        | improvement\r\nincludes:              {                        |\r\n                       { ethics and sociology   | for sexual conduct\r\n                       { of sex                 |\r\n                       {                        |\r\n                       { psychology of sex      | for sexual health\r\n                       {                        | and conduct\r\n                       {                        |\r\n                       { æsthetics of sex       | for attitude\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex and reproduction.]\r\n\r\nSince the original purpose of sex was perpetuation of plant and animal\r\nspecies, and since in the study of biology the idea of sex is\r\nillustrated and developed by examination of the reproductive processes\r\nin various types, it has been customary for many writers on\r\nsex-education to use the terms \"sex\" and \"reproduction\" as if they were\r\nsynonymous. This is no longer so in human life; for while reproduction\r\nis a sexual process, sexual activities and influences are often quite\r\nunrelated to reproduction. In fact, most of the big problems that have\r\nmade sex-education desirable, if not necessary, are problems of sex\r\napart from reproduction. It therefore seems clear that, while studies\r\nof reproduction are prominent in sex-education, they should be regarded\r\nas introductory to the problems of sex, especially for young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2. _The Misunderstanding of Sex_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Objection to word \"sex.\"]\r\n\r\nSome educators have expressed the wish that some one might suggest a\r\nsatisfactory substitute for the terms \"sex-hygiene\" and\r\n\"sex-education,\" omitting the word \"sex.\" This word and its companion\r\n\"sexual\" are objectionable because they are associated in the minds of\r\nmost people with vulgar interpretation of the physical aspects of the\r\nbeginning of individual life, and much of the opposition to the\r\nproposed sex-instruction in home and schools is evidently based on the\r\nfeeling that the very word \"sex\" involves something inherently vulgar.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definite words necessary.]\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many decades will pass before the majority of\r\nintelligent people cease to feel that the words \"sex\" and \"sexual\" have\r\nhad such vulgar associations that they should be kept out of our\r\neveryday vocabulary, but I can see no hope of developing an improved\r\nattitude towards the sexual aspect of human life if we continue to\r\nadmit that we are afraid of the necessary words. It seems to me that in\r\none decade there has been a great advance in that the scientific\r\nwriters and speakers on problems of sex have been using words which\r\ndefinitely and directly express the desired meanings, and have avoided\r\nthe suggestive circumlocutions which characterize many modern realistic\r\nnovels. One who does not already appreciate the serious impressiveness\r\nof cold scientific language in discussion of sexual problems should\r\ntake one of the indecently suggestive paragraphs from stories in the\r\nmost notoriously vulgar of the fifteen-cent magazines, and translate\r\nthe meaning of the paragraph into direct and definite words. The result\r\nwill be complete loss of the stealthy suggestiveness which has made\r\nconcealed sexuality so dangerously attractive to the type of mind that\r\nrevels in the modern sex-problem novels. We want no such suggestive\r\nconcealment in a scheme of sex-education, for it aims at a purer and\r\nhigher understanding of sex in human life. We must have direct and\r\ndefinite and dignified scientific language, and among the necessary\r\nwords none are as essential as \"sex\" and \"sexual.\" We must use them\r\nfreely if attitude towards sex is to be improved; and their dignified\r\nand scientific usage will gradually dispel the embarrassment which many\r\nunfortunate people now experience when these words remind them that the\r\nperpetuation of life in all its higher forms has been intrusted to the\r\ncoöperation of two kinds, or sexes, of individuals.\r\n\r\nThus viewing the objections which have been raised against the use of\r\nthe word \"sex\" in the educational movement, I have shifted my first\r\nstand with the opposition until now I favor the frank and dignified use\r\nof this and similar words on appropriate occasions. I believe that\r\nthose interested in the search for solutions of the vital problems of\r\nsex should quietly but systematically work to include the words \"sex\"\r\nand \"sexual\" in the dignified and scientific vocabulary needed by all\r\npeople to express the newer and nobler interpretations of the\r\nrelationships between men and women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No \"sex\" studies.]\r\n\r\nOf course, this does not mean that sex, either as a word or as a fact\r\nof nature, should be over-emphasized with people who are too young to\r\nappreciate the fundamental facts of life. As already suggested, it is\r\nnot desirable that any parts of the curricula for schools should be\r\nknown to the pupils as \"sex\" studies; but we need such terms as\r\n\"sex-hygiene\" and \"sex-instruction\" to indicate to teachers and parents\r\nthat certain parts of the education of the children are being directed\r\ntowards a healthy, natural and wholesome relation to sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Sex\" and \"love.\"]\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to suppose that the free, dignified, and scientific use of\r\nthe word \"sex\" is going to make people more sensual, more uncontrolled,\r\nand more immoral. There is much more reason for fearing the free use of\r\nthe word \"love,\" which has both psychical and physical meanings so\r\nconfused that often only the context of sentences enables one to\r\ndetermine which meaning is intended. In fact, many writers and speakers\r\nseek to avoid all possible misunderstanding by using the word\r\n\"affection\" for psychical love. Now, in spite of such confusion, and\r\nthe fact that to many people the word \"love\" in connection with sex\r\nsuggests only gross sensuality, we continue to use it freely and it is\r\none of the first words taught to children. Why then do we not hear\r\nprotests against using the word \"love\"? Simply because we have been\r\nfrom childhood accustomed to the word, first in its psychical sense,\r\nand it is only later that most of us have learned that it has a sensual\r\nmeaning to some people. In short, familiarity with the word \"love\" in\r\nits psychical sense has bred in us a contempt for those who mistake the\r\nphysical basis of love for love in its combined physical and psychical\r\ncompleteness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of sex.]\r\n\r\nTo many it is surprising to find that the word \"sex\" has never been\r\nused in such degraded connections as has the word \"love,\" and that it\r\nhas not been half so much misunderstood. There is no obvious vulgarity\r\nin the lexicographer's definitions of the word \"sex.\" It simply means,\r\nas the science of biology points out so clearly, that the perpetuation\r\nof human life, and of most other species of life, has been intrusted to\r\npairs of individuals which are of the two kinds commonly called the\r\nsexes, male and female. Why nature determined that each new life in the\r\nvast majority of species should develop from two other lives has long\r\nbeen a biological puzzle, and most satisfactory of the answers given is\r\nthat bi-parental origin of new individuals allows for new combinations\r\nof heritable qualities from two lines of descent. However, such a\r\nbiological explanation of the relation of the two sexes to double\r\nparentage is of relatively little practical significance in present-day\r\nhuman life when compared with the fact that out of the necessity for\r\nlife's perpetuation by two coöperating individuals there has grown\r\npsychical or spiritual love with all its splendid possibilities that\r\nare evident in ideal family life. Moreover, the influence of sex in\r\nhuman life has extended far beyond the family (that is, that group of\r\nindividuals who stand related to one another as husband, wife, parents,\r\nand children), for it is a careless observer indeed who does not note\r\nin our daily life many social and psychical relationships of men and\r\nwomen who have no mutual interests relating to the biological processes\r\nof race perpetuation. Of course, the psychologist recognizes that far\r\nback of the platonic contact of the sexes on social and intellectual\r\nlines is the suppressed and primal instinct that provides physical\r\nunions for race perpetuation. However, this is of no practical\r\ninterest, for, as a matter of fact, the primal instincts are quite\r\nsubconscious in the usual social relations between the sexes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The larger view of sex.]\r\n\r\nThere is grandeur in this view of sex as originally a provision for\r\nperpetuation of life by two coöperating individuals, later becoming the\r\nbasis of conjugal affection of the two individuals for each other and\r\nof their parental affection for their offspring, and finally leading to\r\nsocial and intellectual comradeship of men and women meeting on terms\r\nwhich are practically free from the original and biological meaning of\r\nsex.\r\n\r\nInstead, then, of trying to keep sex, both word and fact, in the\r\nbackground of the new educational movement, I believe it is best to\r\nwork definitely for a better understanding of the part which sex plays\r\nin human life, as outlined in the preceding paragraph. Hence, in these\r\nlectures I shall never go aside in order to avoid either the word or\r\nthe idea of sex; on the contrary, I shall attempt to direct the\r\ndiscussion so as to emphasize the larger and very modern view of the\r\nrelationship of sex and human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The many-sided bearings of sex.]\r\n\r\nIn this first lecture I want to make it clear that the rôle of sex in\r\nhuman life is vastly greater than that directly involved in sexual\r\nactivity. I shall in several lectures touch the big problems from the\r\nstandpoint of the sexual instincts as these play an important part in\r\nsocial, psychical, and æsthetic life even if they are rarely exercised,\r\nphysiologically, or if, as in millions of individuals, they never come\r\nto mean more than possibilities of sexual activity for which\r\nopportunities in marriage do not come. I am especially anxious to avoid\r\nthe narrow viewpoint of numerous writers on sex-hygiene who seem to\r\noverlook the fact that sexual functioning is only a prominent incident\r\nin the cycle of sexual influences in the lives of most people. Human\r\nlife, and especially marriage, should no longer be regarded from the\r\nmere biological point of view as for the sole purpose of reproductive\r\nactivity. It is a far more uplifting view that the conscious or\r\nunconscious existence of the sexual instincts, with or without\r\noccasional activity, affords the fundamental physical basis for states\r\nof mind that may profoundly affect the whole course of life in every\r\nnormal man and woman.\r\n\r\nSupplementary to this section on the \"Misunderstanding of Sex,\" I\r\nsuggest the reading of Chapters I-VI of \"Sex\" by Geddes and Thomson,\r\nthe \"Problems of Sex\" by the same authors, and Chapter VI in \"The\r\nWonder of Life\" by Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Need of Sex-Instruction_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The old silence and the new enlightenment.]\r\n\r\nThe time-honored policy has been one of silence and mystery concerning\r\nall things sexual. Everything in that line has long been considered\r\nimpure and degraded and, therefore, the less said and the less known,\r\nthe better, especially for young people. Such has been the almost\r\nuniversal attitude of parents until within the present century, when\r\nmany have awakened to the fact that the policy of silence has been a\r\ngigantic failure, because it has not preserved purity and innocence and\r\nbecause it has allowed grave evils, both hygienic and moral, to develop\r\nunder the cloak of secrecy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Children will not remain ignorant.]\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe in teaching my boys and girls any facts concerning\r\nsex. I prefer to keep them innocent until they have grown up.\" In these\r\ndecisive words a prominent woman closed a statement of her firm\r\nconviction that the world-wide movement for the sex-instruction of\r\nyoung people is a stupendous mistake. Poor deluded mother! How does she\r\nexpect to keep her children ignorant of the world of life around them?\r\nIs she planning to transplant them to a deserted island where they may\r\ngrow up innocently? Or is she going to keep the children in some\r\ncloister within whose walls there will be immunity from the\r\ncontamination of the great busy world outside? Or is she going to have\r\nthem guarded like crown princes, and if so, where are absolutely safe\r\nguards to be found? Such are the questions which rush into the minds of\r\nthose who have studied the problem of keeping children ignorant of the\r\nmost significant facts of life. It is usually an easy matter to protect\r\nchildren against smallpox and typhoid and some other diseases, but no\r\nparent or educator has yet found out how we may be sure to keep real\r\nlive children ignorant of sex knowledge. They seem to absorb such\r\nforbidden facts as naturally and as freely as the air they breathe.\r\nAsk any large group of representative men--ministers, or doctors, or\r\nteachers, or men of business, or the world's toilers--whether any of\r\nthem knew the essential facts of sexual life before they were twelve\r\nyears of age, and ninety-seven in every hundred will answer quickly in\r\nthe affirmative. Ask any large group of women, excepting those whose\r\ngirlhood has been guarded with exceptional care, and the overwhelming\r\nmajority will acknowledge that they knew the essential facts before\r\nthey were fifteen years old. Once more, ask these same men and women\r\nwhether their early knowledge of sex came from pure and reliable\r\nsources or from vulgar playmates and depraved servants; and with rare\r\nexceptions it is found that vulgarity made the strongest impression in\r\nthe first lessons concerning the great facts of life. Such being the\r\ntruth, it is nonsense for parents to sit in complacency because they\r\nfeel sure that their children are safely protected against any vulgar\r\nfirst lessons concerning sex; for no one can know that children are\r\nsafely guarded from others who may corrupt their innocent minds. As an\r\nillustration, a few years ago the mothers of a group of little girls in\r\none of the best-managed private schools felt that with careful\r\nsupervision both in school and home there was no danger of forbidden\r\nknowledge reaching the children. But one day a new pupil innocently\r\nexhibited to her mother a miniature notebook with unprintable notes on\r\nsexual topics. The resulting investigation revealed a secret club\r\norganized by the pupils for the purpose of passing to each member\r\nthrough notebooks all newly acquired information, which had a peculiar\r\nvalue because it must be kept secret from teachers and parents. That\r\nclub had been in existence during two school years. This is only a\r\nsample case of many which have proved that if children are allowed the\r\nfreedom that developing individuality demands, their mothers must not\r\nfeel too sure that their darlings are protected against knowledge of\r\nlife, and perhaps of life in its most degraded aspects.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The vital question for parents.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is the fact that every parent should ponder seriously:\r\nNormal children are almost certain to get sexual information not later\r\nthan the early adolescent years, and usually from unreliable and vulgar\r\nsources. It is, therefore, not a question whether children of school\r\nages should be taught the important facts of sex, but whether parents\r\nand trained teachers rather than playmates and other unreliable persons\r\nshould be the instructors. Which will parents choose for their own\r\nchildren? Thousands of intelligent parents have already faced this\r\nquestion, and have decided that their children shall have early\r\nsex-instruction in home or school or both in order that there will be\r\nlittle danger of vulgar impressions taking a deep hold on child minds.\r\n\r\nGranted, then, that children should be given some reliable instruction\r\nconcerning things sexual, who should be the teacher, what should be\r\ntaught, and when should the instruction be given? These are the\r\nfundamental questions now being considered by the parents and educators\r\nwho have accepted sex-education as necessary. Upon the final answers to\r\nsuch questions the decision of many parents will depend. I shall\r\nattempt to answer them in later lectures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex mystery has prevented progress.]\r\n\r\nThe policy of maintaining mystery and secrecy concerning sex has failed\r\nwith adults even more sadly than with children. Health and morals have\r\nsuffered incalculable injury. The sexual evils of our time are not as\r\nbad as were those of the ancient civilizations, but we have little\r\nreason to be proud of the slight progress made. But why should we\r\nexpect the human to make progress when sexual problems have been kept\r\nin darkness? The wonder is that, with the prevailing dark outlook on\r\nsexual life throughout the past nineteen centuries, the world has not\r\ndeveloped more sexual vice. Innate animalistic appetites have tended to\r\nlead downward, and surely the policy of silence has offered no\r\ncounteracting influence towards higher living. While religion and\r\nethics, by means of certain rules of conduct, have maintained certain\r\nsexual standards, they have not kept vast numbers of humans from\r\nfalling far below those standards into utter degradation. The modern\r\nteachers of religion and ethics have prevented general sexual\r\ndegradation, but they have failed to give human sexuality any decided\r\nuplift. The reason for this failure is the policy of mystery and\r\nsilence. The teachers of religion and ethics have preferred to let\r\ngeneral and more or less abstruse rules govern conduct in sexual lines.\r\nUntil recent years there have been few sermons in which common sexual\r\nproblems have been presented so that the preacher's meaning has been\r\nclear to all. On the contrary, there has been universal mystery and\r\nevasion concerning the greatest facts of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sexual instincts offer no guidance.]\r\n\r\nMany people have justified the mystery thrown around sexual processes\r\non the theory that the reproductive instincts of mature people are\r\nsufficient guides for conduct. This involves a misunderstanding of\r\nsexual instincts of the higher mammals which are often unscientifically\r\ncited as models for human imitation. In these animals sexual union is\r\ninstinctively determined, because normally the sexual hunger or\r\nexcitement of both sexes is stimulated and controlled by the\r\nphysiological condition of the female at the times favorable for\r\nfertilization (_i.e._, at the oestrual periods). For example, a pair of\r\ndogs living in close companionship show signs of mutual sexual desires\r\nonly for a few days at the semi-annual oestrual or fertile periods of\r\nthe female. It occasionally happens that the males of various wild and\r\ndomesticated mammals exhibit signs of automatic sexual excitement\r\n(_i.e._, not caused by the stimulus arising from the physiological\r\ncondition of the female); but in such cases of male excitement outside\r\nof the mating or oestrual periods, the normal females invariably offer\r\ninstinctive opposition to attempted union by abnormally or\r\nautomatically excited males. Thus, directly and indirectly, there is\r\ninstinctive control and limitation of sexual union among the animals\r\nthat are most closely related to the human race.\r\n\r\nIt is biologically possible that similar conditions may have existed in\r\nthe earliest human life, but that is pure speculation and has no\r\nbearing on the practical problems of sex in human life to-day. The fact\r\nis that the simple physiological stimuli which produce sexual\r\nexcitement in both sexes of animals have practically no influence in\r\ndetermining human sexual union. On the contrary, memory associations\r\nconsciously connected with the opposite sex, especially those\r\nassociations that are centered in affection, may at any time in the\r\nnormal individual of either human sex afford the basis for a chain of\r\nmental states leading to sexual excitement and union. There is not, as\r\nin the animals, instinctive dependence on the physiological conditions\r\nthat are favorable for fertilization. In fact, spontaneous\r\nphysiological demands play in civilized human life a minor part in\r\ninitiating sexual excitement. The reason why some humans seem to have\r\nunusual sexual intensity is not so much a matter of exceptionally\r\nstrong sexuality as of susceptibility to the numerous sexual stimuli\r\nwith which modern life abounds. For this reason, a man who has formed\r\nlewd memory associations is more susceptible to sexual stimulations,\r\n_e.g._, by obscene pictures, vulgar words, unusual dress or actions of\r\nwomen, close physical association as in dancing, and certain forms of\r\nmusic. It is not at all uncommon that individuals who are\r\nhyper-sensitive to sexually suggestive stimuli are really functionally\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intelligent control only.]\r\n\r\nIt follows from the facts outlined above that instinctive control of\r\nsexual actions applies to animals but not to human life. On the\r\ncontrary, human control must be on the basis of intelligent choice.\r\nThis means the greatest task of human life, for it requires voluntary\r\ncontrol of instinctive demands which are intensified by numerous\r\nstimuli or temptations that are exclusively human. No wonder that\r\nnatural sex hunger left uncontrolled leads human beings to excesses and\r\ndegradation that no species of animals with their guiding instincts\r\ncould possibly reach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Individual responsibility.]\r\n\r\nThe absence from human life of any instinctive control of sexual\r\nactions leaves a great responsibility on each individual whose natural\r\ndesires lead impulsively and insistently towards sexual union and must\r\nbe restrained, controlled, and directed by voluntary choice. In short,\r\nall individuals who are intelligent beings are personally responsible\r\nfor voluntary control of their sexual desires with reference to the\r\nethical, social, and eugenic interests and rights of all other\r\nindividuals now and in the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sexual knowledge necessary.]\r\n\r\nWith such an understanding of instincts in relation to human sexual\r\nactions, we cannot wonder that the old policy of mystery has failed so\r\ncompletely. Since human beings are left to control the most powerful\r\nappetite by intelligence, it is evident that a policy based on silence,\r\nignorance, and mystery must fail. The only safe and sure road to the\r\nneeded control of sexual actions is to be found in knowledge, and the\r\nwidespread recognition of this fact has led to the new movement for\r\ngeneral enlightenment regarding sexual processes in their various\r\nrelations to human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education as a solution of sex problems.]\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that we have turned to seek an educational\r\nsolution for the problems of sex. Education has become the modern\r\npanacea for many of our ills--hygienic, industrial, political, and\r\nsocial. We have found people losing health for various reasons and we\r\nhave proposed hygienic instruction as a prophylactic. We have analyzed\r\nmany problems of the industries, and now we are beginning to seek their\r\nsolution in industrial education. We have noted that numerous social\r\nand political misunderstandings check progress of individuals and\r\nnations, and we are coming to think the pathway upwards is to be found\r\nin better knowledge of social and political science. And, in like\r\nmanner, in every phase of this modern life of ours we are looking to\r\nknowledge as the key to all significant problems. It is truly the age\r\nof education, not simply the education offered in schools and colleges,\r\nbut education in the larger sense, including the learning of useful\r\nknowledge from all sources whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWith such unbounded confidence in the all-sufficiency of education, it\r\nis most natural that we should turn to it in these times when we have\r\ncome to realize the existence of amazing sexual problems caused either\r\nby ignorant misuse, or by deliberate abuse, of the sexual functions\r\nwhich biologically are intrusted with the perpetuation of human life\r\nand which psychologically are the source of human affection in its\r\nsupreme forms. If education is to solve the civic, hygienic, and\r\nindustrial problems of to-day and to-morrow, why should it not also\r\nhelp with the age-old sexual evils? So reasoning, we have naturally\r\nturned to education as one, but not the only, method of attack on the\r\nsexual problems which have degraded and devitalized human life of all\r\npast times, but which somehow have kept out of the limelight of\r\npublicity until our own times.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The Scope of Sex-education_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-education is not primarily for schools.]\r\n\r\nIt is well to make clear in this first lecture that no one proposes to\r\nlimit sex-instruction to schools and colleges. We may safely leave\r\nmathematics and writing and even reading to schools, but sex-education\r\nwill fail unless the schools can get the coöperation of the homes, the\r\nchurches, the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., the W.C.T.U., the Boy Scouts, the\r\nCamp Fire Girls, and other organizations which aim to reach young\r\npeople socially, religiously, and ethically. The part which these have\r\nalready taken in the sex-education movement is in the aggregate far\r\nmore important than what the schools have been able to accomplish.\r\nSex-education, then, should be understood as including all serious\r\ninstruction--no matter where or when or by whom given--which aims to\r\nhelp young people face the problems that normal sexual processes bring\r\nto every life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-instruction impossible in most homes.]\r\n\r\nIn a later lecture I shall urge the importance of beginning\r\nsex-instruction in the home. There are some parents who wish that it\r\nwere possible not only to begin but also to end it there, for they fear\r\nthat public instruction will lead to a weakening of a certain sense of\r\nreserve and privacy that has long been considered sacred to the best\r\nfamily life. Perhaps this has some truth, but we must remember that\r\nonly in rare homes are there such ideal relationships of parents to\r\neach other and to their offspring that matters of sex are sacred to the\r\nfamily circle. The fact which parents and educators must face is that\r\nthere are now relatively few homes in which there is one parent able to\r\nbegin the elementary instruction of young children; and, therefore, as\r\na practical matter for the best interests of the vast majority of young\r\npeople, we must consider ways and means for instruction outside of most\r\nhomes. This need not interfere in the least with the parents who are\r\nable and willing to give sex-instruction to the children, for the home\r\ninstruction will naturally anticipate that which the schools must give\r\nfor the pupils who are not properly instructed at home. It seems to me\r\nto be a situation like that of children learning to read at home and\r\nlater continuing reading at school. Sex-instruction begun at home will\r\nform the child's attitude and give him some elementary information, and\r\nlater he may profitably learn more in the same lines in the class work\r\nof school, especially in connection with science instruction for which\r\nfew homes have facilities. Moreover, it is quite possible that one\r\ninstructed at home in childhood may gain from later school instruction\r\nsomething of great social value, for we must remember that the problems\r\nof sex which most demand attention are not individual, but social.\r\nHence, it may be worth while for the home-instructed individual to\r\nlearn through class instruction that people outside the home look\r\nseriously upon knowledge concerning sexual processes, and that every\r\nindividual's life must be adjusted to other lives, that is, to society.\r\n\r\nSummarizing, it appears that however desirable home instruction\r\nregarding sex may be, the majority of parents are not able and willing\r\nto undertake the work, and so the public educational system and\r\norganizations for social and religious work should provide a scheme of\r\ninstruction which will make sure that all young people will have an\r\nopportunity to get the most helpful information for the guidance of\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Caution in school instruction.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parents' co-operation.]\r\n\r\nIn order to gain the serious attention of those who believe themselves\r\nunalterably opposed to school instruction regarding things sexual, I\r\nanticipate a later discussion and mention in this connection that\r\nthere must be great caution in all attempts at school teaching that\r\ndirectly touches human sexual life. It would be a dangerous experiment\r\nto introduce sex-instruction into all schools by sudden legislation.\r\nThere must be specially trained teachers of selected personality and\r\ntact. No existing high school has enough such teachers, and in the\r\ngrammar schools where the pupils are at the age when proper instruction\r\nwould influence them most, the problem of general class instruction is\r\nabsolutely unsolved. Only here and there in schools below the high\r\nschool has a teacher or principal of rare quality made satisfactory\r\nexperimental teaching. So uncertain are we at present regarding how we\r\nshould approach the problem of teaching grammar-school children that\r\nthe only safe advice for general use is that teachers, or preferably\r\nprincipals, should begin with parents' conferences led by one who is a\r\nconservative expert on sex-instruction. Were I principal of a school\r\nwith pupils from, say, two hundred and fifty homes, I should begin at\r\nonce to organize conferences designed to awaken the parents to the need\r\nof sex-instruction for their children, and to the importance of making\r\nat least a beginning in the homes. I should expect, according to the\r\nexperience of others, that of the five hundred parents, two hundred\r\nmothers and fifty fathers would take an interest in the conferences,\r\nand that at least one hundred fathers too busy for meetings would\r\napprove heartily after hearing reports from their wives. Thus, I\r\nshould try to reach the majority of homes represented in my school. I\r\nshould be in no hurry to introduce class instruction--I mean\r\ninstruction related directly to human life; but, of course, I should\r\nencourage my teachers to emphasize the life-histories of animals and\r\nplants in the nature-study, and so lay in the pupils' minds a firm\r\nfoundation for later connection between human life and all life. At the\r\nsame time, I should keep my teachers on the lookout for individual\r\npupils or groups that might need special attention and, if such be\r\nfound, I should seek the coöperation of their parents. And finally,\r\nafter a year or two of co-working with parents, I should hope to get\r\npermission for special talks based on nature-study and hygiene. These\r\ntalks should first be given to limited groups of pupils, preferably in\r\nthe presence of some parents who are interested and who have given\r\ntheir children some home instruction. Working along such conservative\r\nlines, I believe a tactful principal of a grammar school might succeed\r\nin developing much of the needed instruction for pre-adolescent pupils.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instruction in high schools.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to high-school pupils, we should remember that nine-tenths\r\nof the desirable information is already included in the biology of our\r\nbest high schools. The remaining tenth is that which connects all life\r\nwith human life; and this requires tact and exceptional skill. However,\r\nthe high schools no longer offer an insoluble problem, for many\r\nteachers have succeeded in giving the desirable instruction to the\r\nsatisfaction of critical principals and parents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-education from early childhood to maturity.]\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread impression that sex-instruction should begin with\r\nthe approach of adolescence and soon be completed. This idea is often\r\nexpressed by parents and even by prominent educators who say that the\r\nfather or teacher ought \"to take the boy of thirteen aside and tell him\r\nsome things he ought to know.\" Still others have the same point of view\r\nwhen they advocate that a physician should be called for a lecture to\r\nhigh-school boys. In fact, most people who have not seriously studied\r\nthe problems of sex-education seem to believe that one concentrated\r\ndose of sex-instruction in adolescent years is sufficient guidance for\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\nSuch limited personal instruction might suffice if sex-education were\r\nlimited to sex-hygiene. A few hygienic commands in pre-adolescent years\r\nand one impressive talk in early puberty might teach the boy or girl\r\nhow not to interfere with health; but it is improbable that such brief\r\ninstruction will make a permanent impression which will insure hygienic\r\npractice of the precepts laid down. If we hold that sex-hygiene is\r\nimportant, then it must be drilled into the learner from several points\r\nof view. An isolated lesson on any topic of general hygiene is of very\r\ndoubtful efficiency.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Brief instruction does not fix attitude.]\r\n\r\nThe most important reason why sex-instruction should not be\r\nconcentrated in a short period of youth is that it is impossible to\r\nexert the most desirable influence upon health, attitude, and morals\r\nexcept by instruction beginning in early childhood and graded for each\r\nperiod of life up to maturity. Most young people who in early\r\nadolescence receive their first lessons from parents and teachers have\r\nalready had their attitude formed by their playmates. Even their morals\r\nmay become corrupted and their health irreparably injured several years\r\nbefore puberty. The only sure pathway to health, attitude, and morals\r\nis in beginning with young children and instructing them as gradually\r\nas the problems of sex come forward.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-instruction after youth.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest possible good of sex-education will not be secured if it\r\nstops with early adolescent years. There are many problems of sex in\r\nrelation to society, particularly in relation to monogamic marriage,\r\nthat young people should be led to consider in the late teens and early\r\ntwenties. Our sex-education system will not be completely organized\r\nuntil we find ways and means for carrying the instruction by lectures,\r\nconferences, and books beyond the years commonly occupied by\r\npublic-school education. Colleges and other higher educational\r\ninstitutions may contribute somewhat to this advanced sex-instruction;\r\nbut obviously the great majority of maturing young people cannot be\r\nreached personally except by instruction arranged in churches, the\r\nY.M.C.A., and the Y.W.C.A., evening schools, and other such\r\ninstitutions. In many respects this proposed instruction for maturing\r\nyoung people is of very great importance and deserves encouragement\r\nsuch as has not yet been given by those who have written and lectured\r\nin favor of a movement for sex-education of young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The larger sex-education.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion of this introductory lecture, let me say that I have\r\ntried to suggest in a general survey that sex-education in its largest\r\noutlook touches great problems of life in very many ways. I have also\r\ntried to convince that it is far more than merely a school subject,\r\nlimited entirely to a curriculum extended over a few years. This is the\r\ncommon misunderstanding arising from the familiar use of the word\r\n\"education.\" As opposed to this narrow conception, I understand\r\nsex-education, the larger sex-education, to be a collective term\r\ndesignating all organized effort, both in and out of schools, toward\r\ninstructing and influencing young people with regard to the problems of\r\nsex. Here we have returned to the central thought of the definition\r\nwith which this lecture opened, and which I emphasize because it is the\r\nfoundation of all future lectures: The larger sex-education includes\r\nall scientific, ethical, social, and religious instruction and\r\ninfluence which in any way may help young people prepare to meet the\r\nproblems of life in relation to sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEMS FOR SEX-EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Sex Problems and the Need of Special Knowledge_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Arguments for sex-education.]\r\n\r\nIn these lectures I shall discuss the great sex problems towards the\r\nsolution of which knowledge conveyed by special education may help.\r\nThese problems offer reasons or arguments in favor of sex-education,\r\nand I shall attempt to present them from this point of view. I shall at\r\nthe same time point out in preliminary outline how organized\r\ninstruction may apply more or less directly to the sex problems that\r\nseem to show the need of educational attack, but in later lectures the\r\norganization of instruction will be considered more specifically.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Propagandism needed.]\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the literature that during the past decade has advocated\r\nsex-education, it has seemed to me that there is left little\r\npossibility of any decidedly new and important contribution to the\r\narguments favoring such instruction, for the whole case has been\r\nsplendidly presented by eminent writers in the fields of medicine,\r\nbiology, sociology, and ethics. It now appears that the great majority\r\nof educators, scientists, and intelligent citizens in general have\r\naccepted the arguments for sex-instruction, so far as they have been\r\ninformed concerning the meaning and need of the movement; and this\r\nleads me to the belief that in the future we need not new arguments but\r\nfrequent restatements of the established facts which indicate the\r\nimportance of widespread knowledge regarding the function that is\r\ninseparably connected with the perpetuation of life. In short, we now\r\nneed a propagandism for extending the sex-education movement among the\r\nmasses of people.\r\n\r\nFor those who have already accepted sex-education, a survey of the\r\nfacts that created a demand for sex-instruction will give a clearer\r\noutlook on the movement. The rapid increase of interest in\r\nsex-education has been the result of widespread dissemination of\r\nconvincing facts concerning some common disharmonies that grow out of\r\nthe sexual problems of the human race. These facts which have led to\r\nsex-education should be kept in mind by all who wish to understand or\r\nto play a part in the instruction of young people.\r\n\r\nIt is quite unnecessary, and still more undesirable, to recite at\r\nlength in these lectures the social, medical, and psycho-pathological\r\nfacts concerning abnormal or perverted sexual processes. Fortunately,\r\nthe educational ends may be gained by a general review that points out\r\nthe bearings of the main lines of the sexual problems, the\r\nmisunderstandings and mistakes that education may help prevent and\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parents should know reasons for sex-instruction.]\r\n\r\nIt is important that the general public, especially the parents, should\r\nunderstand the reasons which have induced numerous physicians,\r\nministers, and educators to become active advocates of systematic\r\nsex-instruction for young people. Although the movement has made\r\nextensive progress in the ten years of propagandic work, is probably\r\ntrue that the majority of even intelligent parents are not yet\r\nconvinced that their children need sex-instruction. This is due largely\r\nto the fact that the parents have not yet been shown the reasons why it\r\nis now, and always has been, unsafe to allow children to gain more or\r\nless sexual information from unreliable and vulgar sources. In fact, it\r\nis surprising to find many parents, especially mothers, who seem unable\r\nto grasp the idea that their \"protected\" children can possibly get\r\nimpure information.\r\n\r\nThere are other parents who know that their children are almost sure to\r\nget vulgar information regarding sexual matters, and that some young\r\npeople are likely to make sexual mistakes; but they calmly look upon\r\nsuch things as part of the established order of the world.\r\n\r\nStill another type of parents who should know the reasons for\r\nsex-instruction are those who accept the traditional idea that their\r\ndaughters must be kept \"protected\" and \"innocent\" while their sons are\r\nfree to sow a large field of \"wild oats,\" concerning which society in\r\ngeneral, and such parents in particular, will care little as long as\r\nsocial diseases, bastardy suits, or chronic alcoholism do not result\r\nfrom the dissipations. These are the fathers and mothers who need the\r\nmost enlightenment concerning the importance of such sex-instruction as\r\nwill make clear the far-reaching consequences of \"wild oat sowing.\"\r\nPerhaps most such parents are ignorant, but some are simply\r\nthoughtless. As an illustration of the latter, the editor of a\r\nwell-known magazine was recently talking with a prominent author and\r\nmade some reference to the immoral habits of young men. Their\r\nconversation was essentially as follows: The author remarked, \"I assume\r\nthat my boys will be boys and will have their fling before they settle\r\ndown and marry.\" The editor quickly replied, \"Yes, and I presume that\r\nyou expect your boys to sow their wild oats with my daughters, and that\r\nin return you will expect my sons to dissipate with your daughters. At\r\nany rate, you have damnable designs on somebody's daughters.\" This put\r\non the wild-oat proposition a light which was apparently new to the\r\nliterary man, for he replied, \"That is a phase of the young man's\r\nproblem which never occurred to me. It does sound startling when stated\r\nin that personal way.\"\r\n\r\nAll these classes of parents who have not yet learned the facts which\r\npoint to ignorance as the cause of the abundant sexual errors of young\r\npeople and those who do not understand that sexual promiscuity or\r\nimmorality is an error of gravest significance both to the individual\r\nand to society, should have set before them time and again some of the\r\nstartling facts which in the first five years of the American\r\nsex-education movement were promulgated among physicians, ministers,\r\nand educators. All such ignorant or indifferent parents will not take\r\nan interest in the proposed sex-instruction unless they are convinced\r\nby frank and forcible statements regarding the great need of special\r\nsafeguarding of young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special associations needed.]\r\n\r\nSince there are so many people who still need the most elementary\r\nknowledge concerning the sexual problems that demand educational\r\nattack, it is important that there should be local associations which\r\ncan manage lectures, publications, conferences, and other means of\r\ninforming the public as to the gravity of the sexual problems of our\r\ntimes, and as to the part which sex-instruction may play in the attempt\r\nat finding a solution. Such work is now being done splendidly by the\r\nsocieties named in § 51. The magnitude of the problem of reaching the\r\npublic is such that there is abundant work for numerous branches of\r\nsuch societies or for local groups willing to take a part in the needed\r\nwork. As suggested elsewhere, the success of the movement for\r\nsex-instruction of children of school ages will depend largely upon the\r\nattitude and coöperation of parents; and hence it is important that\r\nparents should be led to understand the reasons or arguments for\r\nsex-instruction. In other words, they should know the problems that\r\nindicate the importance of enlightening the rising generation\r\nconcerning the great facts of sex and life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books for parents.]\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous publications that seem to me adapted for convincing\r\nparents that their children need instruction, I commonly mention the\r\nfollowing: Lowry's \"False Modesty\" and \"Teaching Sex Hygiene,\" Howard's\r\n\"Start your Child Right,\" Wile's \"Sex Education,\" Galloway's \"Biology\r\nof Sex,\" March's \"Towards Racial Health,\" Lyttleton's \"Training of the\r\nYoung in Laws of Sex,\" and pamphlets by Dr. Prince Morrow. See also\r\npages 241-243.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Knowledge needed concerning eight sex problems.]\r\n\r\nThere are eight important sex problems of our times that offer reasons\r\nor arguments for sex-instruction, because ignorance plays a large part\r\nin each problem. I shall state them briefly here and discuss each in\r\nsucceeding lectures: (1) Many people, especially in youth, need\r\nhygienic knowledge concerning sexual processes as they affect personal\r\nhealth. (2) There is an alarming amount of the dangerous social\r\ndiseases which are distributed chiefly by the sexual promiscuity or\r\nimmorality of many men. (3) The uncontrolled sexual passions of men\r\nhave led to enormous development of organized and commercialized\r\nprostitution. (4) There are living to-day tens of thousands of\r\nunmarried mothers and illegitimate children, the result of the common\r\nsexual irresponsibility of men and the ignorance of women. (5) There is\r\nneed of more general following of a definite moral standard regarding\r\nsexual relationships. (6) There is a prevailing unwholesome attitude of\r\nmind concerning all sexual processes. (7) There is very general\r\nmisunderstanding of sexual life as related to healthy and happy\r\nmarriage. (8) There is need of eugenic responsibility for sexual\r\nactions that concern future generations.\r\n\r\nHere are the eight sexual problems of our times. Any one of them has\r\nsignificance great enough to demand the attention of educators and\r\nsocial reformers. One and all they point to the need of better\r\nunderstanding regarding the sexual functions and their relation to\r\nlife. I shall now turn to outline the main facts concerning each of\r\nthese sexual problems so far as it seems likely that they will concern\r\neducators and social workers. For convenience I shall use the following\r\nbrief headings: (1) Personal sex-hygiene, (2) social diseases, (3)\r\nsocial evil, (4) illegitimacy, (5) sexual morality, (6) sexual\r\nvulgarity, (7) sexual problems and marriage, (8) eugenics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Historical order.]\r\n\r\nThese sexual problems toward whose solution special instruction of\r\nyoung people may help are stated here in the order in which they have\r\nattracted attention as reasons for sex-education. Thus, for instance,\r\npersonal sex-hygiene was the chief reason recognized twenty years ago;\r\nsocial diseases began to attract public attention ten years ago;\r\ncommercial prostitution has been especially prominent in the\r\ndiscussions of the past five years; and only recently has there been\r\nemphasis on sex-education with reference to eugenics.\r\n\r\nThe historical order which I follow in this lecture is not now the\r\norder of greatest importance. For example, sexual morality (5) and\r\nvulgarity (6) are probably of far greater significance than any of the\r\nother sexual problems that offer arguments for sex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not all sex problems concern youth.]\r\n\r\nTo avoid possible misunderstanding, let me repeat from the first\r\nlecture the proposition that sex-education should extend in home and\r\nschool from childhood to maturity. It follows that these lectures\r\nconcerning the problems of sex that seriously affect the human race are\r\nnot all applicable as arguments for instruction in schools or for\r\nchildren of school age. Some of the problems of sex point to the need\r\nof special instruction in pre-adolescent or in adolescent years, but\r\nsome of them concern directly only those who are approaching maturity.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _First Problem for Sex-instruction: Personal Sex-hygiene_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal and social hygiene.]\r\n\r\nIt is convenient to group under personal sex-hygiene all hygienic\r\nknowledge concerning sexual processes in their personal as\r\ndistinguished from their social aspects. The distinction between these\r\ntwo aspects of sex-hygiene is essentially on the same basis as that\r\nbetween personal and public hygiene. For example, indigestion and\r\noverwork are matters of personal hygiene, while tuberculosis and\r\ntyphoid are problems of public hygiene because the individual case\r\nleads through infection to disease of others. Similarly, such\r\nindividual disorders as masturbation and deranged menstruation concern\r\npersonal health directly, while venereal diseases are clearly included\r\nin social sex-hygiene.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal sex-hygiene needed.]\r\n\r\nIf there were no other reasons for sex-instruction, I believe that it\r\nwould be worth while to teach such hygienic knowledge of self and sex\r\nas would guard young people against harmful habits and unhealthful care\r\nof their sexual mechanisms; and which, moreover, would guide them\r\nacross the threshold of adolescence with some helpful understanding of\r\nthe significance of the metamorphosis. Many men and women suffer from\r\ninjured, if not ruined, health because they did not know, especially\r\nbetween ten and fourteen years, the laws of personal sex-hygiene, which\r\nconcern health in ways not involving sexual relationship. Many boys and\r\nsome girls are injured both physically and mentally by the habit of\r\nmasturbation. Numerous girls are injured physically and many mentally\r\nbecause they have not learned in advance the nature and hygiene of\r\nmenstruation. Many boys are injured both in mind and character because\r\nthey have no scientific guidance which helps them understand themselves\r\nduring the stormy transition from youth into manhood. Moreover, there\r\nare certain simple hygienic commands that children under twelve should\r\nreceive from parents and teachers. In all these lines the bearings of\r\npersonal hygienic instruction are so obvious that we need not at this\r\ntime stop to consider in more detail this first reason or problem for\r\nsex-instruction of young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Second Problem for Sex-instruction: Social Diseases_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Recent publicity regarding vice and disease.]\r\n\r\nDuring the past decade the general public has received some astounding\r\nrevelations concerning the enormous extent of illicit sexual\r\npromiscuity, which is immorality according to our commonly accepted\r\ncode of morals. Along with the evidence as to the existence of\r\nwidespread promiscuity, has come the still more alarming information\r\nfrom the medical profession that sexual promiscuity commonly\r\ndistributes the germs of the two highly infectious and exceedingly\r\ndestructive diseases, syphilis and gonorrhea, known in medical science\r\nas venereal or social. When these are acquired by individuals guilty of\r\nsexual promiscuity, they seriously and often fatally affect the victim;\r\nbut of far greater social-hygienic importance is the medical evidence\r\nthat they are very often transmitted to persons innocent of any\r\ntransgression of the moral law, especially to wives and children.\r\n\r\nThe medical revelations concerning the relation of sexual immorality to\r\nthe plague of social diseases, has come from certain eminent\r\nphysicians, notably the late Dr. Prince A. Morrow. His translation of\r\nFournier's \"Syphilis and Marriage\" (1881), his own \"Social Diseases and\r\nMarriage\" (1904), and several of his pamphlets published by the\r\nAmerican Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, have been\r\nauthoritative statements of conditions as the medical world sees them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social diseases and immorality.]\r\n\r\nThe extent of social diseases is a fairly accurate measure of the\r\nminimum amount of immorality, for nothing is better established in\r\nmedical science than that promiscuity in sexual relations is directly\r\nor indirectly responsible for spread of the microörganisms which cause\r\nthe diseases. If for several generations all men and women limited\r\ntheir sexual relations to monogamic marriage, and the relatively rare\r\ncases of non-sexual and prenatal infection were treated so as to render\r\nthem non-contagious, the social diseases would probably disappear from\r\nthe human family. Such a statement is significant only in showing the\r\nrelation of social diseases to sexual promiscuity, for of course, there\r\nis no reasonable hope that the venereal germs will ever be annihilated\r\nby universal monogamy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attack by education and sanitation.]\r\n\r\nReduction of the amount of venereal disease must depend upon (1)\r\nhygienic and moral education which will lead people to avoid the\r\nsources of infection and (2) sanitary and medical science which works\r\neither by applying antiseptic or other prophylactic methods for\r\npreventing development of the causative microörganisms, or by using\r\ngermicides for destroying those germs which have already produced\r\ndisease. Thus the educational and the sanitary attack on the social\r\ndiseases lie parallel. Both are needed, for, even with all the possible\r\nmethods of attack, the progress against these diseases will be\r\nexceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in the facts relating to social diseases which\r\npoint to the need of sex-education as one method of prevention, are\r\nreferred to the pamphlets published by the American Society of Sanitary\r\nand Moral Prophylaxis; Morrow's \"Social Diseases and Marriage\";\r\nCreighton's \"The Social Disease and How to Fight It\"; Dock's \"Hygiene\r\nand Morality\"; Henderson's \"Education with Reference to Sex\"; and\r\ncertain chapters in Warbasse's \"Medical Sociology.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Estimated amount of disease.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the accuracy of the commonly quoted statements\r\nconcerning the prevalence of social disease, and therefore of\r\nimmorality, it must be said in all fairness that there has been much\r\nguesswork and some deliberate exaggeration. We learn from various books\r\nand lectures that fifty, sixty-five, seventy-five and even ninety per\r\ncent of the men in the United States over eighteen years of age are at\r\nsome time infected with at least one of the social diseases. The fact\r\nis that there is no scientific way of getting accurate statistics, for\r\nunlike other contagious diseases, the venereal ones are kept more or\r\nless secret, and numerous cases cannot be discovered by health\r\nofficers. All the published figures regarding the prevalence of such\r\ndiseases are merely estimates based upon the experience of certain\r\nphysicians with special groups of men, especially in hospitals. There\r\nis no reliable scientific evidence as to the prevalence of venereal\r\ndisease in the whole mass of our American population.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education not concerned with percentages.]\r\n\r\nHowever, so far as education is concerned, there is nothing to be\r\ngained by dispute as to the possible inaccuracy of the higher\r\npercentages,[1] for it is generally admitted that probably over fifty\r\nper cent of the men in America and Europe become infected with\r\ngonorrhea or syphilis, or both, one or more times during their lives,\r\nespecially in early manhood. This conservative estimate is sufficient\r\nto show that the sexual morals of probably the majority of men are at\r\nsome time in their lives loose. There is reason to believe that with\r\nmost such men the period of moral laxity is in early manhood before\r\nmarriage, which, though not excusable, is explainable on physiological\r\ngrounds. It is important to correct the wrong impression which is now\r\nwidespread, especially among women who have read the more or less\r\nsensational statements in certain books and magazines, that the quoted\r\nfigures on social disease mean that from fifty to ninety per cent of\r\nall men are immoral from time to time for many years. If that were\r\ntrue, the situation represented by the highest estimates would be\r\nhopeless, and we might as well start out to adjust society to a system\r\nof recognized sexual promiscuity. Fortunately, it is far from true, for\r\na great many men included in even the conservative statistics of\r\nsocial disease were infected because they strayed from the moral path\r\nvery few times and in many cases only once. This fact makes the outlook\r\nfor improved sexual morals and health more hopeful, for probably the\r\nmajority of young men need help in controlling themselves for a few\r\nyears only, especially between eighteen and twenty-five.[2]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Established facts.]\r\n\r\nThe reports of medical men regarding the damage done by the social\r\ndiseases are inaccurate chiefly when they attempt to state percentages\r\nof the whole population. They are reliable when they state observed\r\nfacts, such as the following: It is now established in medical science\r\nthat (1) gonorrheal infection results in tens of thousands of cases in\r\ncomplications, such as heart disease, gonorrheal rheumatism, sterility\r\nof both men and women, blindness of infants, inflammatory diseases of\r\nfemale reproductive organs, and other well-marked sequelæ of the\r\ndisease; and (2) that syphilis is responsible for a large majority of\r\ncases of locomotor ataxia, paresis and certain types of insanity, and\r\nalso for numerous aneurisms of arteries, many apoplexies, and much\r\ndisease of liver, kidneys, and other organs. Moreover, syphilis is\r\ncharged with being the greatest race destroyer. Fournier, the great\r\nFrench specialist, noted that only two children survived from a series\r\nof ninety pregnancies of syphilitic women of the well-to-do class. It\r\nis probably true that much less than ten per cent of syphilitized\r\nembryos ever grow into mature men and women, and even these few\r\nsurvivors are likely to carry in their bodies the germs or the \"virus\"\r\nof syphilis which may affect the next generation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social diseases admittedly dangerous.]\r\n\r\nSuch direct statements as the above may be accepted as not exaggerated.\r\nHowever, it little matters in sex-education, except for the purposes of\r\nsensational writers, whether statistics regarding the damage done by\r\nvenereal diseases are more than estimates; for it is sufficient to\r\nremember that every physician of large experience agrees that syphilis\r\nand gonorrhea are so common and so destructive of health and life that\r\nthey must be classed among the most dangerous diseases that now\r\nthreaten the human race. This ought to be sufficient to attract the\r\nserious attention of every thinking man and woman.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Double standard of morality.]\r\n\r\nThus, in general survey, we see the great problems of social-sexual\r\nhygiene caused by diseases that are widely distributed because sexual\r\ninstincts are uncontrolled. In short, the alarming problem of the\r\nsocial diseases results from masculine promiscuity or the failure of\r\nmen to adhere to the monogamic standards of morality. In other and\r\nfamiliar phrasing, there is widespread acceptance and practice of the\r\nso-called \"double standard of sexual morality,\" a monogamic one for\r\nrespectable women and promiscuity for many of their male relatives and\r\nfriends. (See writings of Morrow, especially \"The Sex Problem\"; also\r\nCreighton's \"The Social Disease.\")\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: One problem for sex-education.]\r\n\r\nOur brief survey of the hygienic problems caused by sexual promiscuity\r\nand its characteristic diseases is sufficient to indicate one great\r\nproblem for sex-education. Such social-hygiene problems have been most\r\nresponsible for the recent and rapid rise of the movement for\r\nsex-education, and they must be recognized in any adequate scheme for\r\ninstruction of young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is sex-hygiene adequate?]\r\n\r\nCan scientific education hope to solve the sexual problems of society\r\nby inculcating such fear of venereal diseases that men will remain true\r\nto the monogamic code of morality? Many cynical disbelievers in\r\nsex-hygiene answer this question negatively by asking in biblical\r\nphrase, \"Can the leopard change his spots?\" In other words, these\r\ndoubting ones believe that sexual instincts are so firmly fixed in the\r\nnature of _many_ men and _some_ women that there is no hope of radical\r\nchange through education.[3] There is something in this point of view.\r\nIt is probably true that even the most radical advocates of\r\nsex-education do not hope to secure universal monogamy and consequent\r\ndisappearance of social diseases. A conservative and rational answer to\r\nthe above question whether sex-education can solve the problem of\r\nsocial diseases, is that a large percentage of even civilized people\r\nare not yet ready to have their most powerful instincts controlled by\r\nscientific knowledge. Hence, there is no hope that the hygienic task of\r\nsex-education will be finished soon after instruction becomes an\r\nestablished part of general education in homes and schools. At the very\r\nbest there will be incomplete returns for the social-hygienic aspect of\r\nsex-instruction, but already we know for a certainty that enough young\r\nmen will be influenced to make the teaching justifiable. I feel sure of\r\nthis because I have met personally many such men and my friends know\r\nmany more.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigations made by Dr. Exner, the medical\r\nsecretary of the Young Men's Christian Association, a great reduction\r\nof venereal disease has followed sex-hygienic campaigns in college\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical treatment.]\r\n\r\nIn another way hygienic teaching may reduce the amount of venereal\r\ndiseases, and that is by leading infected individuals to seek thorough\r\nmedical treatment without delay. This, of course, will render the\r\ndiseased person non-infectious to others. Physicians report that there\r\nis now a marked movement in this direction and, moreover, that many\r\ninfected young men voluntarily seek medical examinations before\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Woman's need of information.]\r\n\r\nEven if we refuse to believe that social-hygienic teaching will protect\r\nmany young men from sexual diseases, there is the woman's need of\r\ninformation to be considered. As said before, women more than men\r\nsuffer the consequences of venereal infections. Therefore, every young\r\nwoman who considers marriage should know the possibility of danger to\r\nherself and her children, and be able to decide accordingly. Of course,\r\neven with much knowledge she may marry the wrong man, for correct\r\ndiagnosis of social disease is not always easy; but if her confidence\r\nis betrayed and she becomes infected, she ought to know the importance\r\nof immediate and radical medical treatment. Let me illustrate these\r\nstatements that women should know the danger of venereal disease. One\r\nof my college friends neglected an important legal case to travel seven\r\nhundred miles in order to tell face to face another college friend that\r\nshe was about to marry a dangerous man. Being utterly ignorant of the\r\nexistence of sexual diseases, the girl and her mother characterized my\r\nfriend's statement by a short and ugly word, and ordered him to leave\r\ntheir home instantly. The marriage occurred and some months later the\r\nyoung woman went to her grave, a victim of gonorrheal salpingitis and\r\nperitonitis.\r\n\r\nAnother case which illustrates the danger of a woman's ignorance: One\r\nof my students of many years ago married a minister who infected her\r\nwith syphilis and kept her from medical attention until the disease\r\nwas in a highly developed stage, and even then conspired with an\r\ninefficient doctor to keep her ignorant of the nature of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The right to knowledge.]\r\n\r\nThese are not extreme cases, for any physician with large experience\r\nknows that such things are common. Medical literature is full of such\r\npainful recitals of venereal tragedies. It is not desirable that all\r\nyoung women should know the details of such tragedies, but they should\r\nknow that dangers exist. Parents and educators will not have done their\r\nduty until they coöperate to give all young women the protective\r\nknowledge they have a right to demand.[4]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Best people must lead.]\r\n\r\nThere is another way of looking at the possible effect of the social\r\nside of sex-hygienic instruction. It is sure to make a decided\r\nimpression upon many young people of the type that we regard as the\r\nbest in every way. These will be the leaders of the future and they in\r\nturn will help improve conditions. Perhaps it may all work out as the\r\ndrug problem is being solved. Widespread social and hygienic\r\ninformation regarding the harmful effect of alcohol, cocaine, opium,\r\nand other drugs has first of all impressed leading citizens; and these\r\nare beginning to control by laws those who cannot be reached directly\r\nby education. In some such ways those who are impressed by formal\r\nsex-education may lend a hand in influencing many who could not be\r\ntouched directly by hygienic education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Legislation needed.]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that public enlightenment regarding the dangers of\r\nsocial diseases will soon lead to legislation and public medical work\r\nwhich will contribute greatly towards reduction of the diseases. For\r\nexample, legislation with reference to venereal disease should require\r\ndoctors to report cases to health officers, should forbid \"quack\"\r\nadvertising of fake \"cures,\" should forbid sale by drug stores of\r\nnostrums for personal treatment, should provide dispensaries and\r\nhospitals for reliable treatment at reasonable cost, should require\r\nmedical examinations for marriage licenses and provide for such\r\nexaminations at moderate charges or at public expense, should require\r\ncertain sanitary precautions in care of eyes of new-born infants, and\r\nshould provide for discovery and treatment of congenital syphilis in\r\nschool children. These are lines in which good laws might help vastly\r\nin the war against the social diseases. Moreover, it is obvious that\r\nall laws which help control the social evil will work indirectly\r\nagainst the social diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Probable results of instruction.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems probable that popular knowledge of the social\r\nside of sex-hygiene will reduce the amount of venereal disease (1) by\r\nteaching some people the dangers of promiscuity, (2) by adoption of\r\ncertain sanitary precautions that lessen danger of infection, (3) by\r\nleading people to seek competent medical aid which, while often\r\nfailing to restore the victim's health, will probably eliminate the\r\ndanger of contagion for others, and (4) by intelligent support of laws\r\nthat directly or indirectly affect the social diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social diseases not most important.]\r\n\r\nI have given great prominence to the social-sexual diseases in their\r\nrelation to sex-education because along this line there has been\r\ndeveloped the widespread interest in sex-instruction as _one_ method of\r\nprotecting young people against promiscuity. So far as the questions of\r\nteaching are concerned, my personal view is that some of the other\r\nreasons or problems for sex-instruction are more important, because I\r\nbelieve that educational emphasis on them will give the greatest\r\nresults in improved sexual conditions of society.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _Third Problem for Sex-instruction: the Social Evil_\r\n\r\nSo far as the problems of sex-education are concerned, there is nothing\r\nto be gained by an extensive review of commercialized prostitution. It\r\nis generally accepted that the social evil or prostitution is increased\r\nby the common ignorance of young people of both sexes regarding the\r\nphysical and social relations of sex.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not true that all prostitution is due to ignorance,\r\nfor it often involves enlightened men and women. However, there seems\r\nto be good reason for believing that large numbers of people of both\r\nsexes might be kept out of prostitution by very simple sex-instruction.\r\nLet us look for a moment at some facts concerning the relation of the\r\nignorance of the women to their entrance into the underworld, and later\r\nconsider certain reasons why many men patronize the social evil.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why women enter prostitution.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the women victims of prostitution, it seems to be\r\ngenerally accepted that economic pressure, feeble-mindedness, bad\r\nsocial environment, and unguided instincts, independently or combined,\r\nare the chief causes of their downfall. However, there is a deeper\r\nreason why numerous women enter prostitution, for all of these factors\r\ncommonly operate because of inadequate sexual knowledge. In short,\r\nignorance is the fundamental cause of much prostitution on the part of\r\nwomen. Many a girl with starvation wages, bad social surroundings,\r\nsub-normal mentality, or even intense instincts is able to keep her\r\nwomanhood because she knows the awful dangers of sexual promiscuity.\r\nFor our present educational purposes, it is sufficient to point out the\r\nopinion of competent social workers that knowledge might often\r\ncounteract the forces that lead women from virtue and down into\r\nprostitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Men also ignorant.]\r\n\r\nA large number of men patronize prostitution because they are ignorant\r\nin one or more of the following respects. Some of them have drifted\r\ninto abnormal sexual habits when they were boys, and later into illicit\r\nrelations. Some of them did not know the effect of alcoholic drinks in\r\nleading many young men to their first immoral sexual acts. Some of them\r\nhave deliberately patronized prostitution because they have accepted as\r\ntruth the monstrous lie that sexual activity is necessary to preserve\r\nthe health of men.[5] Most of the men do not realize that prostitution\r\noffers great danger to their own health, still greater danger to the\r\nhealth of innocent wives and children, and a greatly shortened life for\r\nmany women who are the victims of sexual slavery. Most men do not know\r\nthat dark tragedies are often concealed beneath the apparent gay life\r\nof the women who are victims of sexual degradation. These are some of\r\nthe things of which many young men I have known were very ignorant, and\r\nit has been no difficult task to trace a close connection between their\r\nignorance and their vice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ignorance the chief cause.]\r\n\r\nLooking at the social evil from any point of view, it seems to me that\r\nignorance, dense ignorance, is largely responsible for the existence of\r\nthat darkest blot on our boasted civilization--the social-sexual evil.\r\nNo matter how we look at the established facts regarding prostitution,\r\nthey all point to the need of sexual instruction for the protection of\r\nthe youth of both sexes. The Chicago Vice Commission concluded that\r\n\"the lack of information, education and training with reference to the\r\nfunction and control of the sexual instinct, and the consequences of\r\nits abuse and perversion, appears at every point of our inquiry for\r\nthe sources of the supply of the victims of vice, either as the cause\r\nof the perversion of children and youth or as a complication of all\r\nother causes.\"[6] Of course, we dare not dream that any sex-instruction\r\nthat now seems possible will completely eradicate prostitution; but we\r\ndo know of thousands of boys and girls who have been directed to safety\r\nby knowledge of some fundamental sexual facts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex plays and novels.]\r\n\r\nConcerning presentation of the social evil by fiction and the drama,\r\nthere is much honest disagreement. My personal opinion is that little\r\ngood is done by the theater or by such publications as Reginald\r\nKaufmann's \"House of Bondage,\" and Elizabeth Robin's \"My Little\r\nSister.\" They all leave the unsophisticated reader with an exaggerated\r\nand even hysterical notion that white slavery is exceedingly common and\r\nthe main cause of prostitution. Certainly the great majority of the\r\narmy of prostitutes, both public and clandestine, in America, and a\r\nstill higher percentage on the continent of Europe, did not become\r\nnovitiates of vice in prisons of prostitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limited reading desirable.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that a very limited reading regarding the social evil is\r\nsufficient for one who is not engaged in medical or social work that\r\nrequires scientific knowledge of this darkest side of human life.\r\nCertainly, the indiscriminate reading of vice investigations is\r\ndangerous for many young people,--for young men because some of them\r\nare allured into personal investigations, and for young women because\r\nthey get an exaggerated and pessimistic view of all sexual problems.\r\nFor the intelligent reader who wants the general information that every\r\npublic-spirited citizen should have, the well-known book by Jane Addams\r\nwill serve both as an outline and an encyclopedia of the social evil.\r\nSocial workers and some educators will find use for the other books\r\nmentioned below.\r\n\r\n  Jane Addams.--\"A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil.\"\r\n    (Macmillan).\r\n\r\n  Seligman, E.R.A.

Of course, I\r\nknow that there are well-meaning people who argue that motherhood is\r\nthe supreme fact and that the formality of a marriage ceremony is\r\nmerely a medievalism in our laws and customs; but the inexorable truth\r\nremains that our modern social system is centered around the home which\r\nis strictly regulated by church and state and public opinion.[7]\r\nWhatever may be the philosophical rights and wrongs of individual\r\nfreedom in sexual relationship, the facts of practical life are that an\r\noverwhelming majority of the most intelligent people are united in\r\nsupport of our established laws and customs demanding legitimacy of\r\nmotherhood and birthright. As a result of this age-old stand for\r\nlegitimacy, illegitimate mothers and children do not have a square deal\r\nat the bar of public opinion. Everybody knows that the vast majority of\r\nillegitimate children do not have a fair chance in the world's work.\r\nProfessor Cattell, in _Science_, March, 1914, points out that since\r\nillegitimates occur one in every twenty-five births in the United\r\nStates, and since they are on the whole equal to other children in\r\nmentality, there ought to be forty of them among the thousand leading\r\nmen of science designated in the directory of the \"American Men of\r\nScience;\" but none are known. The conclusion must be that illegitimate\r\nchildren do not have an equal chance at education which leads to\r\nprominence in science. But it is not simply a matter of limited\r\neducation, for in every way the fate of most illegitimate children is\r\nusually pitiful. Only now and then one born under a lucky star is\r\nadopted and educated by large-minded foster parents who recognize that\r\nthe illegitimate is not responsible for having come into this world\r\nunder conditions opposed to the best interests of society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ignorance the cause.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to be generally accepted that in the vast majority of cases,\r\nunmarried mothers and illegitimate children are due to ignorance of the\r\nwomen. Women who are professionally immoral do not bear many\r\nchildren.[8] In fact, excepting the feeble-minded prostitutes, the\r\ngeneral rule is that those who are mothers have only one child and that\r\none the result of the first sexual errors. It is a safe general\r\nconclusion that ignorance of sexual laws is responsible for the great\r\nmajority of cases of illegitimacy.\r\n\r\nEdith Livingston Smith, of Boston, in an article on \"Unmarried Mothers\"\r\nin _Harper's Weekly_ for September 6, 1913, expressed views of the\r\ncauses of illegitimacy that many a social worker will indorse heartily:\r\n\r\n    \"I see shop girls and waitresses, factory girls and maids, chorus\r\n    girls, stenographers, and governesses, each with a different\r\n    story, each with the same terror of the consequences of their\r\n    folly. 'I never knew,' they tell me, 'I never knew there were such\r\n    temptations.'...\r\n\r\n    \"Let us go back to the question of sex-education of the public.\r\n    Silence has been the policy in the past. We have taught our\r\n    children biology and natural history, we have taught them\r\n    physiology, carefully ignoring the organs of reproduction; we\r\n    have warned the young to make use of their senses and their\r\n    brains, but we have refused to recognize the very force that\r\n    guides all these instincts, the vital power of sex. Yet, in the\r\n    face of this stupidity, acknowledging the call of the age, girls\r\n    are sent out into the industrial world, where they fight shoulder\r\n    to shoulder with men. Here they find potential worth of their\r\n    individualities; here they meet with the same--no\r\n    greater--temptation than their brothers, but with no knowledge to\r\n    guide them, no traditions to give them poise, no ameliorating\r\n    factor of social tenderness or tolerance when inexperience fails\r\n    to temper their emotions and their femininity....\r\n\r\n    \"A girl's protection must come from without, a boy's from within.\r\n    Every boy who reaches the age of adolescence knows his nature. It\r\n    asserts itself. His sex instincts are dominant, aggressive. He is\r\n    man, the father of the race, and the laws of procreation are to\r\n    him an open book. A girl stays innocent until she is awakened. It\r\n    is the kiss, the touch, the senses stirred, that make her, in the\r\n    glory of her womanhood or in her shame, acknowledge her sex.\r\n\r\n    \"The very frailty of such a girl, her dependence upon her\r\n    intuitions and emotions, the triumph of feeling over intellect,\r\n    place her in greater danger than her brothers, even were their\r\n    responsibility to society the same. But, add to this the fact that\r\n    in yielding to sexual temptation she has the burden of\r\n    child-bearing--how much more necessary that she should have some\r\n    knowledge of what she is to meet in the world, or what she must\r\n    combat, lest her emotions forestall her intelligence as physical\r\n    development precedes mental appreciation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Men also ignorant.]\r\n\r\nIllegitimacy is often due to ignorance of men as well as of women.\r\nProminent physicians have cited from their notebooks cases of\r\n\"protected\" children in early adolescence who instinctively entered\r\ninto sexual relationship in utter ignorance of the natural result. Such\r\ncases where the boy is entirely ignorant must be very rare; but there\r\nare probably many boys who do not really understand that the sexual act\r\nis very likely to lead to a ruined life for the girl companion and her\r\noffspring. Arthur Donnithorne, in \"Adam Bede,\" did not forecast that\r\nhis act would lead to the ruin of Hetty Sorrel and her condemnation for\r\ninfanticide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More than biology needed.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that something more than the ordinary biological facts of\r\nreproduction must be included in sex-instruction that tries to prevent\r\nsuch tragedies. In another lecture we shall consider moral teaching,\r\nbut here let us look at the cold facts of life that ought to be taught\r\nat some appropriate time to young people. Not only should they know the\r\nsimple biological probability that sexual relationship will lead to\r\nreproduction, but they should be led to consider the relentless\r\nconsequences of illegitimate propagation. On this latter point general\r\nliterature, _e.g._, \"Adam Bede\" and \"The Scarlet Letter,\" teaches some\r\nimpressive lessons.\r\n\r\nAnother point needs emphasis with the numerous young people, especially\r\nmen, who are not controlled by moral laws, who know the probabilities\r\nof illegitimacy occurring, but who have acquired the popular\r\nimpression that the order of nature is easily changed. Many physicians\r\nand social workers know girls who have gone down because they were\r\npersuaded to trust the efficiency of popular ways and means of avoiding\r\nthe natural outcome of the sexual act. Hence, young people of both\r\nsexes should somehow learn that under the conditions that usually\r\nattend illicit union there is always a strong probability that the ways\r\nof nature cannot be easily circumvented. It is unlawful to explain,\r\nexcept to medical audiences, why this is so; but much illegitimacy will\r\nbe prevented if it can be made widely known among young men and women\r\nthat, according to reliable physicians, tragedies of illegitimacy are\r\noften due to misplaced confidence in popular methods of contraception.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criminal operations.]\r\n\r\nThere is yet another line of information that if widely known might\r\nhave some bearing on the problem of illicit sexual relations:\r\nPhysicians and social workers report that many young men and some women\r\nknow the possibility of illegitimate pregnancy, but feel safe because\r\nthey know the addresses of doctors and midwives who will perform\r\ncriminal operations. The great danger of the operation, especially at\r\nthe hands of such third-class doctors as would attempt to terminate\r\npregnancy criminally, should be widely known by the general public,\r\nwhich only now and then gets a hint in the newspaper reports of a\r\ntragedy involving some unfortunate girl.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relative passion of men and women.]\r\n\r\nThere is the widespread misunderstanding among young men that sexual\r\nhunger is as insistent in virtuous young women as in themselves and\r\nthat therefore illicit gratification is a mutual gain and\r\nresponsibility. Some young men may be guided by the information that\r\nthere is much reliable evidence indicating that, while an innate\r\ntendency towards general emotions of affection is strong in the average\r\nyoung woman, there is general absence of the localized passions that\r\nnaturally and automatically develop in young men. In other words, the\r\nfirst definite sexual temptation is likely to come to a young woman\r\nfrom outside herself, and young men should be impressed with their\r\nresponsibility for allowing even the beginning of situations that may\r\narouse dormant but dangerous instincts.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. _The Fifth Problem for Sex-education: Sexual Morality_\r\n\r\nIn this lecture I shall set forth the proposition that a definitely\r\norganized scheme of education should aim directly at making young\r\npeople strict adherents of the established code of sexual morality. For\r\nbrevity, I shall occasionally speak of morality and immorality,\r\nomitting the qualifying word \"sexual.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Definition of sexual morality.]\r\n\r\nThis lecture, in fact this entire series of lectures on sex-education,\r\nis based on the fundamental proposition that sexual morality demands\r\nthat sexual union be restricted to monogamic marriage, and conversely,\r\nthat such sexual relation outside of marriage is immoral. Such a\r\ndefinition of sexual morality is accepted by church and state and the\r\nchief citizens in every civilized country. It is the only practical\r\ndefinition which is satisfactory to the vast majority of educated\r\nAmerican men and women, even to those who believe in freedom of divorce\r\nand in forgiveness for youthful transgressions of the accepted moral\r\ncode. Sexual morality has had changeable standards, and in other times\r\nand countries custom has made polygamy and promiscuity acceptable as\r\nmoral; but the monogamic ideal of morality now prevails in the world's\r\nbest life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morality in America and Europe.]\r\n\r\nMonogamic morality as a protection for family life means much more in\r\nAmerica than in Europe. It is true that there is an astounding amount\r\nof prostitution in America, but we should be grateful that our ideals\r\nof the monogamic family have not been seriously influenced and seem to\r\nbe slowly but surely improving among our best people. As illustrations\r\nof our adherence to monogamic law, let me give some facts for\r\ncomparison of America and continental Europe. In America, illegitimate\r\nbirths are not accurately reported but are probably less than five per\r\ncent of the total number for the whole country. Locally the proportion\r\nis often very much higher. Thus in Washington, D.C., where (1914) over\r\nten thousand, chiefly negroes, live in alleys between the streets and\r\nunder extremely unhygienic and immoral conditions, fifty per cent of\r\nthe children are illegitimate, while but twenty per cent of the colored\r\nchildren born of mothers living outside the alleys, and less than\r\neleven per cent of the total born of all races in the city are\r\nillegitimate. In various small American regions with a white population\r\nthe proportion of illegitimacy is astoundingly high, but the average\r\nfor the entire country is hopefully low. In many German towns\r\nstatistics show above twenty-five per cent, and in the whole empire,\r\nmore than half the legitimate first-born children are conceived before\r\nmarriage. All writers, the German ones included, seem to agree that the\r\nmajority of Teutonic men and women enter into free unions before\r\nmarriage and public opinion does not severely condemn.\r\n\r\nIn many rural districts of England, France, and Sweden, and even in\r\nLondon and Paris, a large percentage of the marriages are simply\r\nlegalization of free unions. In short, in all these countries the\r\nmonogamic ideal is not followed by a large percentage of people. It\r\nmust be remembered that the great majority of people involved in the\r\nabove figures are of the peasant and laboring classes; conditions are\r\nquite different among women of the educated classes. These must\r\nultimately set the moral standards for the masses.\r\n\r\nOur American conditions are quite different, especially outside of the\r\nlarge cosmopolitan cities. It is impossible not to believe in the moral\r\nintegrity of the great majority of unmarried women in America.\r\nCertainly even in our worst communities we have no such general\r\nimmorality of women as above European figures suggest. Perhaps\r\nwholesale prostitution in which one public woman may be the mistress of\r\nten, twenty, or even fifty men, may tend to protect any equal number of\r\nAmerican women; whereas in Europe a peasant woman would probably be for\r\na time the paramour of one man, thus tending to make equal numbers of\r\nimmoral men and women.\r\n\r\nHowever, it matters nothing for our present purposes what may be the\r\nexplanation of conditions of sexual promiscuity here or abroad. The one\r\ngreat fact is that our national code of morality is a monogamic one,\r\napproved as ideal even by many of those who fail to live strictly in\r\nharmony with its dictates. Hence, all Americans who are prominently\r\ninterested in sex-education believe that it should aim to make our\r\nyoung people more ready to accept and understand morality according to\r\nthe monogamic ideal.\r\n\r\nThose who are interested in this problem of morality as related to\r\nmarriage should read Foerster's \"Marriage and the Sex Problem.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of sex-hygiene and ethics.]\r\n\r\nAmong those who see the need of teaching sex-ethics as a part of the\r\nlarger outlook of sex-education, there are two points of view: (1)\r\nthose who favor the teaching of sex-ethics with the hope of preventing\r\nthe hygienic problems arising from immorality, and (2) those who\r\nbelieve in sexual morality for its own sake or as an accepted code of\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe founders of the American Society for Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis\r\nplaced sanitation first in the name and stated in the constitution that\r\n\"the object of this Society is to limit the spread of diseases which\r\nhave their origin in the Social Evil. It proposes to study every means,\r\nsanitary, moral, and administrative, which promise to be most effective\r\nfor this purpose.\" Most of the papers that have been read at the\r\nmeetings of the Society have emphasized the sanitary aim as primary,\r\nand the moral aim as a means to the hygienic end; but in the past three\r\nyears there has been a decided tendency towards placing emphasis upon\r\nmorality, and recently the executive committee of the Society voted to\r\npropose the following revised statement: \"The aim of this Society is to\r\npromote the appreciation of the sacredness of human sexual relation,\r\nand thereby to minimize the moral and physical evils resulting from\r\nignorance and vice.\" This change of emphasis is well expressed in\r\nPresident Keyes's report to the Society (_Journal_, Vol. V, No. 1).\r\n\r\nAs to the relation between sex-hygiene and sex-ethics as phases of the\r\nlarger sex-education, there has been much discussion. Several writers\r\nhave contended that there is some conflict between sanitary and moral\r\nends, but have failed to convince most readers that hygiene and ethics\r\nshould not be associated in teaching. In fact, the most impressive\r\nsex-hygiene is that relating to social disease, and its value is\r\nchiefly in the ethical appeal for protection of innocent wives and\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Cabot's view.]\r\n\r\nMost prominent of those who have declared that hygienic and moral\r\nteaching should be dissociated is Dr. Richard C. Cabot, of Boston. I\r\nshall discuss his point of view in connection with a later lecture on\r\n\"Criticisms of Sex-education\" (§ 46). In the present discussion of\r\nsexual morality as an important reason for sex-education, it is\r\nsufficient to say that Dr. Cabot seems to disagree with other teachers\r\non the question of the influence of formal instruction on the morals of\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral and hygienic problems.]\r\n\r\nSex-education is now commonly understood to be attempting to solve the\r\nmoral as well as the hygienic problems of sex. As suggested before,\r\nthese two lines of problems are clearly related but not coincident; for\r\nsexual health and morals are not entirely coördinated. We must not\r\noverlook the possibility that the marvellous progress of\r\nbacteriological and medical science may some day largely reduce the\r\nhealth problems of sex without improving morality. In fact, sexual\r\nimmorality that is hygienic does actually exist to a limited extent.\r\nSuch facts indicate that while sex-education was first planned to solve\r\nhealth problems, the ultimate sex-education must attempt to guide\r\nsexual conduct by moral principles. This coming need of more emphasis\r\non the moral problems of sex should be clearly foreseen by those who\r\nare interested in sex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Super-morality desirable.]\r\n\r\nNow, while sexual morality as commonly understood is a direct aim of\r\nsex-education, it is not, in the opinion of many people, the ideal and\r\nultimate goal of sex-education in its broadest outlook. There is\r\nsomething higher than conventional morality for the reason that, while\r\nnatural sexual union in monogamic marriage is never legally or\r\necclesiastically immoral, it is very often far from ideal. It is not\r\nideal if it is unethical, unhygienic, or unæsthetic. It is unethical,\r\nif it is not a bi-personal desideratum (_i.e._, based on mutual\r\nlove[9]); it is unhygienic when not promotive and conservative of\r\nhealth; and it is unæsthetic if the concomitant psychical reactions are\r\nnot in harmony with the beautiful in nature and life. In all these\r\nways, morality as commonly and legally and ecclesiastically understood\r\nmay fall very far short of the ideal sexual relationships. Such an\r\nideal is now held by many men and women who wish that morality might\r\nmean to all the world not simply the limitation of sexual union to\r\nmonogamic marriage, but also that it might be made to mean an\r\nall-satisfying monogamic affection and comradeship based on certain\r\nphysiological, psychical, æsthetic, and ethical laws that underlie\r\nhuman sexual potentialities. Such would be a morality so far beyond\r\nthe accepted standards that for convenience we may call it\r\nsuper-morality, or the new morality. This, I sincerely believe, is the\r\nultimate goal of sex-education in its largest outlook.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Super-morality deserves emphasis.]\r\n\r\nAmong those who have contributed to the sex-education movement there\r\nare none who have properly emphasized this super-morality, which, I\r\nbelieve, is the ultimate goal of the larger sex-education for the most\r\nenlightened people. The definition that sex-education means all\r\ninstruction which aims to help young people prepare to solve for\r\nthemselves the sexual problems that inevitably come to every normal\r\nindividual, is broad enough to include all questions of hygiene,\r\nmorality, and super-morality that may come into one's life. The third\r\naim of sex-education (§ 16) which refers to the \"social, ethical, and\r\npsychical aspects of sex as affecting the individual life in relation\r\nto other individuals,\" should be understood as meaning first a stand\r\nfor morality and then, this having been attained, super-morality is an\r\neasy stage forward. The same idea was touched by the writer in a paper\r\non \"Biology in Sex-Instruction\" (_Journal of Society of Sanitary and\r\nMoral Prophylaxis_, October, 1911) in these words: \"If the great\r\nquestions of sex relationship are ever satisfactorily solved, it must\r\nbe through the direct application of the four sciences which are\r\ncentered around human life, namely, psychology, ethics, sociology, and\r\nlast, but far from least, æsthetics. As we have seen, biology teaches\r\nmuch directly bearing on the purely physical aspects of the\r\nperpetuation of human life, and its study is absolutely necessary for\r\nmental attitude and basal facts; but the keystone of the arch of\r\nsex-education must be contributed by these four sciences which touch\r\nhuman life much deeper than the merely physical, to which the science\r\nof biology is limited. Above all we must look to these sciences for the\r\nsolution of the problems of sex in relation to society, which more than\r\nany physical ills have led to our present problems concerning sexual\r\ndisharmonies.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Super-morality not for the masses.]\r\n\r\nBut while there is something attractive in this larger interpretation\r\nof sex-education as looking forward to the highest adaptation of sex\r\nand life, I realize that as a practical matter we must first of all\r\nwork with young people for sexual morality as defined by the accepted\r\ncode. We must remember that the vast majority of people are not yet\r\nready, and will not soon be ready, for a code of super-morality.\r\nConfusion might result from an attempt at wholesale teaching of such\r\nidealism of sex relationship. Certainly, so far as sex-education aims\r\nto help immature young people, there is nothing to do but hold up\r\nmonogamic marriage as the basis of our accepted morality; but the\r\nhigher view of super-morality should be promulgated as rapidly as\r\npossible among people who are advanced enough to understand that\r\nmorality as defined by church and state is not the best interpretation\r\nof life's possibilities. To many it is a significant fact that we now\r\nfind numerous young men and women ready to stand for super-morality as\r\na foundation for monogamic marriage. Fortunately, such individuals need\r\nnot wait for the world to grasp the idea of super-morals; and already\r\nthere is many a home in which the higher view of life and sex prevails.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cautious teaching concerning immorality.]\r\n\r\nImmorality in sexual lines should not be overstressed when teaching\r\nyoung people. Rather should there be emphasis on the moral, the normal,\r\nthe healthful, the helpful, and the æsthetic processes in human life.\r\nWe should emphasize sexual health and morals, not disease and\r\nimmorality. Concerning immoral living in general, young people should\r\nknow only enough for necessary warning. Curiosity derived from\r\nextensive knowledge of immorality has drawn many a young man into the\r\nwhirlpool of sexual depravity. It is beyond question that in sexual\r\nlines there is the danger that Pope saw when he declared that vice is a\r\nmonster that seen too oft, we first endure, then pity, then embrace.\r\nSex-education should guard against such dangerous familiarity with\r\nvice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _The Sixth Problem for Sex-education: Sexual Vulgarity_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present attitude.]\r\n\r\nEven a limited study of the prevailing attitude towards sex and\r\nreproduction convinces one that back of the greatest sexual problems of\r\nour times is the almost universal secrecy, disrespect, vulgarity, and\r\nirreverence concerning every aspect of sex and reproduction. Even\r\nexpectant motherhood is commonly concealed as long as possible, and all\r\nreference to the developing new life is usually accompanied with\r\nblushes and tones suggestive of some great shame. Nothing sexual is\r\ncommonly regarded as sacred. Love and marriage, motherhood and birth,\r\nare all freely selected as themes for sexual jests, many of them so\r\nvulgar that no printed dictionary supplies the necessary words. And I\r\nam not simply referring to the great masses of uneducated people, for\r\nthe saddest fact is that a very large proportion of intelligent people\r\nhave not an open-minded and respectful attitude concerning sex and\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vast change of attitude needed.]\r\n\r\nNow, unless we can devise some way to counteract the prevailing narrow,\r\nvulgar, disrespectful, and irreverent attitude towards all aspects of\r\nsex and reproduction; unless we can make people see sexual processes in\r\nall their normal aspects as noble, beautiful, and splendid steps in the\r\ngreat plan of nature; unless we can substitute a philosophical and\r\næsthetic view of sex relationship for the time-worn interpretation of\r\neverything sexual as inherently vulgar, base, ignoble, and demanding\r\nasceticism for those who would reach the highest spiritual development;\r\nunless we can begin to make these changes in the prevailing attitude\r\ntowards sex and reproduction, we cannot make any decided advance in the\r\nattempt to help solve sexual problems by special instruction.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, sex-education must work for a purified and dignified\r\nattitude which sees vulgarity and impurity only when the functions of\r\nsex have been voluntarily and knowingly misused and thereby debased.\r\nSex-education must work against the idea that sexual processes are\r\ninherently vulgar, degraded, base, and impure. Such an interpretation\r\nis correct only when sexual instincts are uncontrolled and thereby out\r\nof harmony with the highest ideals of life. But control does not mean\r\nasceticism which aims at complete subjugation of sexual instincts and\r\nwould annihilate them if that were biologically possible. The early\r\nChristians, disgusted with the sexual degradation of the paganistic and\r\nmaterialistic Romans, preached a doctrine of sexual asceticism as the\r\nideal for those who would rise to the heights of spiritual life. This\r\npessimistic interpretation of the relation of sex and life has\r\npersisted even in some ecclesiastical teachings of the twentieth\r\ncentury, and probably has had not a little responsibility for the\r\nwidely accepted and depressing view that sex is a necessary but\r\nregrettable fact of human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude changing.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, the old ascetic point of view is passing rapidly.\r\nNineteenth-century science has given us a nobler view of the physical\r\nworld. Scientifically considered, matter is no longer base and\r\ndegraded. Especially has the biological science of the past fifty years\r\nmade _living_ matter and its activities profoundly impressive. And of\r\nthe life-activities none are so significant and so all-important as\r\nthose relating to the perpetuation of the human species. Biological\r\nscience has taught this emphatically, and the processes connected with\r\nsex have been lifted to a place of dignity and purity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Æsthetic attitude desirable.]\r\n\r\nThe old asceticism, with its uniformly dark outlook on life, has no\r\nlessons worth while in our modern problems relating to sex.[10] We need\r\nsevere control and not annihilation of our most powerful instincts. The\r\nbright outlook of æsthetics rather than the dark one of asceticism\r\nshould prevail, for sex-instincts and processes are essentially pure\r\nand beautiful phases of that wonderful something we call \"life.\"\r\nSex-education should aim to give this attitude by presenting life as\r\nfundamentally free from the degradation arising from misuse and\r\nmisunderstanding of sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not a new ideal.]\r\n\r\nThe æsthetic interpretation of sex is no new ideal. Canon Lyttleton,\r\nformerly Head Master of Eton College and later Canon of Westminster,\r\nbelieved that \"viewed rightly, the subject of sex, the ever-recurring\r\nmiracle of generation and birth, is full of nobleness, purity, and\r\nhealth.\" The late Dr. Prince A. Morrow wrote, \"the sex function is\r\nintimately connected with the physical, mental, and moral development.\r\nIts right use is the surest basis of individual health, happiness and\r\nusefulness in life, as well as of racial permanence and prosperity. Its\r\nabuse and misuse is the cause of a vast deal of disease and misery.\"\r\nAnd finally, we may quote President-Emeritus Eliot of Harvard\r\nUniversity: \"Society must be relieved by sound instruction of the\r\nhorrible doctrine that the begetting and bearing of children are in the\r\nslightest degree sinful or foul processes. That doctrine lies at the\r\nroot of the feeling of shame in connection with these processes and of\r\nthe desire for secrecy. The plain fact is that there is nothing so\r\nsacred and propitious on earth as the bringing of another normal child\r\ninto the world in marriage. There is nothing staining or defiling about\r\nit, and therefore there is no need for shame or secrecy, but only for\r\npride and joy. This doctrine should be part of the instruction given to\r\nall young people.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attitude all-important in sex-education.]\r\n\r\nIf sex-education succeeds in giving young people this enlightened\r\nattitude, there will be little difficulty in solving most of the\r\nethical and hygienic problems of sex. A young man who has caught a\r\nglimpse of the highest interpretation of sex in its relation to human\r\nlife, in short a young man to whom all natural sexual processes are\r\nessentially pure and noble and beautiful, is not one who will make\r\ngrave hygienic mistakes in his own life, and he will not be personally\r\nconnected with the social evil and its diseases, and he will avoid\r\nalmost intuitively the physiologic and psychologic mistakes that most\r\noften cause matrimonial disaster. Everything, then, in successful\r\nsex-education depends upon the attitude formed in the minds of\r\nlearners; and towards this our major efforts should be directed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Comparison with animals not helpful.]\r\n\r\nThe prevailing vulgar attitude towards sex will not be greatly improved\r\nby repeated emphasis upon the animal nature of reproduction in attempts\r\nat supporting the thesis that propagation is the sole function of\r\nsexual processes in human life. Such an interpretation of human\r\nsexuality as purely animalistic in function is implied, if not\r\nexpressed, by some workers for the \"purity\" movement. I sincerely\r\nbelieve that such a view will inevitably tend to increase the feeling\r\nthat sexual processes are heritages from the beasts which unfortunately\r\nmust be tolerated because nature has provided no other way for\r\nperpetuating human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sexual pessimism.]\r\n\r\nAn intelligent woman, a happy wife and mother, who had accepted this\r\nascetic and pessimistic view of sex, said the other day: \"Oh, love and\r\nmarriage and motherhood would be so beautiful were it possible to\r\nescape the unspeakably vulgar facts of physical life!\" Poor woman! It\r\nmust have been some fiend incarnate who in the guise of a prophet of\r\npurity preached to her the animalistic interpretation of sex, which\r\nmade her overlook the fact that the very beauty which she could not\r\nquite grasp had its origin in her emotions arising from the despised\r\nsexual nature.\r\n\r\nThis is not an isolated case. Several young women who have graduated\r\nfrom college within ten years vouch for the statement that many\r\nthoughtful students are strong in the belief that ideal marriage is\r\nplatonic friendship and that it is a sad fact of life that husband and\r\nwife must lay aside their high ideals in order to become parents.\r\n\r\nSuch depressing interpretations of life are bound to come from the\r\nradical type of \"purity\" preaching based on the sexual mistakes of the\r\npast and on the lives of animals. A similar pessimistic view regarding\r\nthe function of eating might be based on mistakes of drunkards and\r\ngluttons and on the habits of the porcine family. If these are to guide\r\nour conduct, then food-taking is to be regarded as a necessary but\r\nvulgar habit inherited from our animal ancestors; and if we are to be\r\nlogical and attempt to rise to ideal purity in eating, we must hasten\r\nto dispense with the culinary science and all the æsthetics which have\r\nmade civilized eating a fine art. Of course, this is just what the\r\nstrict ascetic does; but such radical disbelievers in the pleasures\r\nthat we have associated with eating would be declared lunatics in any\r\ncivilized country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Two kinds of hunger.]\r\n\r\nI have chosen eating for illustrating my point, for the demands for\r\nfood and for sexual activity are the two primal and necessary forms of\r\nhunger. The hunger for food has led to the refinements of civilized\r\ndining, but there has been great evolution. The animals feed (German,\r\nfressen) in order to satisfy hunger only; civilized humans eat (essen)\r\nnot only to satisfy the hunger appetite inherited from the animals, but\r\nalso for the sake of the concomitant social æsthetic pleasures that add\r\nmuch to the joy of living. Now, if we are logical, we must interpret on\r\nparallel lines the sexual hunger that is necessary for the perpetuation\r\nof human life. Like eating, it is a necessary function inherited from\r\nthe animals; but there has been an evolution of greater significance.\r\nIn the animal world, sexual activity has only one function,\r\nreproduction; but human life at its highest has superadded psychical\r\nand social meaning to sexual relationships, and the result has been\r\naffection and the human family. If we reject this higher view of the\r\ndouble significance of sexuality in human life, and insist that only\r\nthe necessary propagative function is worthy of recognition, it is\r\nalmost inevitable that most people will continue to accept the hopeless\r\nview that human sexuality is on the same vulgar plane as that of the\r\nanimals; in short, that it is only an animal function. This, I insist,\r\nis a depressing interpretation that will never help overcome the\r\nprevailing vulgar attitude toward sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Human sexuality more than animal.]\r\n\r\nIt is only by frankly recognizing and developing the psychical and\r\næsthetic meanings that are distinctly human and superadded to the\r\nmerely propagative function of the animals, that people can be led far\r\naway from the vulgar outlook on sex and reproduction in human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of attitude and morality.]\r\n\r\nThere is no question that wholesome attitude towards sex and\r\nreproduction is closely associated with the problems of sexual\r\nmorality, and especially so far as educational procedure is concerned.\r\nIt is true that large numbers of moral people hold the vulgar attitude\r\ntowards sex and reproduction; but for people who do not accept the\r\nmoral code without question there is probably no better way of teaching\r\nsexual morality than by influencing the individual's attitude. There\r\nare many people who stand for sexual morality for no other reason than\r\nthat they have a dignified and æsthetic attitude towards sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sexual vulgarity a stage in evolution.]\r\n\r\nThere is much evidence that the world is rapidly improving in this\r\nrespect. Sexual vulgarity seems to represent a stage in the evolution\r\nof human life from the barbaric to the fully civilized. The sexual\r\nvulgarity of primitive peoples, both ancient and modern, has been all\r\ntoo frequently recalled by writers whose pseudo-scientific\r\nsuperficiality leads them to believe that knowledge concerning barbaric\r\nand ultra-bestial sensuality will help solve modern sex problems. In\r\nthe classical days when Venus and Bacchus and other deities of\r\nsensuality were worshipped by their devotees, there was sexual\r\nvulgarity in action and language such as now exists only among the most\r\nignorant or depraved people in civilized lands. The advent of Christian\r\ncivilization in Europe left no place for temples and worship of\r\nsensuality, but still the age-old tendency towards a crude and\r\nbarbaric kind of sexual vulgarity and obscenity has continued in\r\nfolklore, in colloquial language, and in literature. However, there has\r\nbeen a vast change in the attitude of the best people within the last\r\ntwo centuries. Once many English writers, many of them now deservedly\r\nobscure, published prose and poetry that would now be criminal. An\r\nunexpurgated edition of Shakespeare's \"Complete Works,\" or of\r\nBoccaccio's \"Decameron,\" could not be circulated through the United\r\nStates mails, and there are many good people who are asking how long we\r\nshall continue to allow the unexpurgated \"Old Testament\" the privilege\r\nof circulation. It is not simply prose and poetry that has been\r\npurified. Scientific literature has shown the influence of the reaction\r\nagainst obscenity. Linnæus and other naturalists of the past were fond\r\nof giving scientific names that perpetuated vulgar comparisons with\r\nsexual organs, but no naturalist of the present day would dare suggest\r\nsuch designations for unnamed animals and plants. The older medical\r\nliterature contains abundant obscenities; but scientific dignity, as\r\nwell as the refinement of modern medical writers, has tended to compel\r\nthe elimination of vulgarity. However, there are still too many\r\nphysicians, especially those working with venereal and genito-urinary\r\ndiseases, who go out of their way to illuminate their conversations,\r\nlectures, books, and magazine articles with veiled vulgarity. Even\r\nhigh-class medical journals occasionally contain illustrations of this\r\ntendency. However, the medical profession as a class stands for\r\ndignified scientific presentation of facts, and obscenity will soon be\r\ntabooed in medical and all other reputable literature. Save for\r\noccasional emanations privately printed by and for degenerate persons,\r\npublic obscenity will soon be unknown. Its complete disappearance will\r\nhave a vast influence upon the problem of sexual attitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. _The Seventh Problem for Sex-instruction: Marriage_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiology and psychology of marriage.]\r\n\r\nIt is the consensus of opinion of numerous physicians, ministers, and\r\nlawyers that a very large proportion of matrimonial disharmonies have\r\ntheir foundation in the common misunderstanding of the physiology and\r\nespecially of the psychology of sex. In the opinion of many students of\r\nsexual problems, this is the strongest reason for sex-instruction. It\r\nis certainly a line in which limited spread of information has already\r\ngiven some definite and satisfactory results. Many of my friends and\r\nformer students have helped me accumulate a long list of cases in which\r\nscientific knowledge regarding sex has prevented and corrected\r\nmatrimonial disagreements; and having easily found so much definite\r\ninfluence of sex-science upon marriage, I am forced to believe that\r\nsex-instruction specially organized for people of marriageable age is\r\nalready giving results of tremendous importance to very many\r\nindividuals. Large numbers of young people are already awake to the\r\nneed of scientific guidance in marriage, and there is a great demand\r\nfor helpful information.\r\n\r\nAdvanced sex-instruction with reference to the problems of marriage\r\nneed not wait for general establishment of elementary instruction for\r\nchildren of school ages. Lectures and books are already reaching large\r\nnumbers of adults. Such enlightenment will help in two ways, by the\r\ninfluence on marriage and by preparing adults to teach children.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other knowledge needed.]\r\n\r\nThere is another side to the problem of marriage that points to need of\r\nthe larger sex-education. Physiology and psychology of sex are\r\nfundamental; but they alone are not sufficient to complete that mutual\r\nadjustment and understanding which marriage at the full development of\r\nits possibilities involves. Matrimonial harmony cannot be entirely a\r\nproblem of applied science, as some superficial devotees of science\r\nseem to think; for science can never analyze those subtle and\r\never-varying qualities that go to make up what we call personality, and\r\nmarriage in its largest outlook is the intimate blending of two\r\npersonalities. Psychological and physiological knowledge will\r\nundoubtedly help the two married individuals in their progress towards\r\nthe harmonious adjustment of their individualities; but there are many\r\nlittle, but often serious, problems that the physiology and psychology\r\nof sex cannot solve. They are problems that involve mutual affection,\r\ncomradeship, sympathy, unselfishness, coöperation, kindliness, and\r\ndevotion of husband and wife. Obviously, these can never be developed\r\nby any formal instruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helpful literature.]\r\n\r\nProbably there is no better way to help young people realize the\r\npossibilities of matrimonial harmony than by suggesting wholesome\r\nliterature. Some of this is a part of the world's general treasure of\r\nbooks that in prose and poetry, in history and romance, hold up a high\r\nideal of love with marriage. There is much such literature that gives\r\nyoung people inspiration, but too much of it, like college life, ends\r\nwith a commencement. \"And then they were married and lived happily ever\r\nafter\"--is the familiar closing as the novelist rings down the curtain\r\nafter reciting only the prologue in the life drama of his two lovers.\r\nWe need more literature that does not end with the wedding march, but\r\nwhich gives young people the successful solution of the problems after\r\nmarriage. Some such is available in history and biography; some in\r\nessays. As I write there come to my mind several books that have\r\nimpressed me: Professor Palmer's \"Life of Alice Freeman Palmer\";\r\nLeonard Huxley's \"Life and Letters of T.H. Huxley,\" which gives many\r\nintimate glimpses of the ideal home life which the great biologist\r\ncentered around Mrs. Huxley; William George Jordan's \"Little Problems\r\nof Married Life\"; Orrin Cock's \"Engagement and Marriage\"; and that much\r\nmisunderstood[11] but helpful book \"Love and Marriage\" by Ellen Key.\r\nMany of the stories by Virginia Terhune Van de Water, published in the\r\nmagazines and collected in a book entitled \"Why I Left my Husband\"\r\n(Moffatt, Yard), deal with real problems of married life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Similar education of the sexes.]\r\n\r\nThe problems of co-education and coördinate education have not a little\r\nbearing on the adjustment of the two sexes in marriage. In these days\r\nwhen vocational education is fashionable in theory and is attracting\r\nattention in practice, we are told that co-education and coördinate\r\neducation are mistakes because they provide the same training for both\r\nsexes. We are told that girls must be educated for their vocation of\r\nhome-making, while boys must be educated for business, trades, or\r\nprofessions. Everywhere in this current movement for vocational\r\neducation we find the emphasis placed on making education for the two\r\nsexes just as dissimilar as possible. Fortunately for the educational\r\nadjustments of the two sexes to each other, much of the present-day\r\ndiscussion that demands extensive sex specialization of education\r\ncannot be made practical and the training of the two sexes will\r\ninevitably continue to be quite similar, with at most a limited amount\r\nof time spent on application of certain knowledge to practical ends\r\nthat are chiefly of interest to one sex only. By far the greater part\r\nof education from kindergarten through the university is in the nature\r\nof the fundamentals of knowledge and will continue to be essentially\r\nsimilar for both sexes. For illustration, the writer happens to be\r\nconnected with a college which offers a four-year course and graduate\r\nwork specially arranged with reference to household arts. Surely here\r\nis an opportunity for education far different from that of the typical\r\ncollege for men. As a matter of fact, there is great similarity. The\r\ngreater part of the four years is filled with general courses in\r\nEnglish, modern languages, chemistry, biology, physics, sociology,\r\neconomics, and fine arts, while a minor part of the curriculum consists\r\nof courses in cookery, clothing, and household administration. The\r\ngeneral courses are in essentials not different from courses in\r\ncolleges for men. Here and there instructors select materials and in\r\nother ways relate the general courses to household arts, but after all\r\na girl who completes these courses has acquired the same educational\r\nfundamentals that her brother gets in Columbia College or in any other\r\nstandard college for men. It is only, then, in the cookery, clothing,\r\nand administration that there is sex-differentiated education, and even\r\nin these the practice necessary to acquire proficiency in technique is\r\nthe chief peculiarity. So far as fundamental knowledge is concerned;\r\ncookery is chiefly an application of chemistry, physics, and physiology\r\nthat could easily be made clear to one who had completed courses in\r\nthese sciences in a college for men; dress design is an application of\r\nfine arts and its construction is a mechanical problem. The mental\r\nproblems involved in dress design and making cannot be far different\r\nfrom house design and construction which are supposed to be primarily\r\nadapted to men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Little differentiation.]\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, there is really little possibility of\r\nsex-differentiated education. This, I insist, is a fortunate fact of\r\nvast importance in the mutual adjustment of the two sexes in marriage.\r\nThere could be no adjustment on an intelligent basis if education could\r\nbe utterly dissimilar. There can be perfect adjustment only when the\r\ntwo individuals are adjusted harmoniously, and that means similar\r\noutlooks on life's problems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need of sex-education for feminism.]\r\n\r\nMany of the problems of the modern feministic movement are such as to\r\ndemand rational education of both women and men with reference to sex\r\nand marriage. Let me quote C. Gasquoine Hartley, whose suggestive\r\nChapters VIII and IX in her \"Truth About Woman\" (Dodd, Mead) deserve to\r\nlive long after the readable but unscientifically applied earlier\r\nchapters are consigned to oblivion:\r\n\r\n    \"To hear many women talk it would appear that the new ideal is a\r\n    one-sexed world. A great army of women have espoused the task of\r\n    raising their sex out of subjection. For such a duty the strength\r\n    and energy of passion is required. Can this task be performed if\r\n    the woman to any extent indulges in sex--otherwise subjection to\r\n    man? Sexuality debases, even reproduction and birth are regarded\r\n    as 'nauseating.' Woman is not free, only because she has been the\r\n    slave to the primitive cycle of emotions which belong to physical\r\n    love. The renunciation, the conquest of sex--it is this that must\r\n    be gained. As for man, he has been shown up, women have found him\r\n    out; his long-worn garments of authority and his mystery and\r\n    glamour have been torn into shreds--woman will have none of him.\r\n\r\n    \"Now obviously these are over-statements, yet they are the logical\r\n    outcome of much of the talk that one hears. It is the visible sign\r\n    of our incoherence and error, and in the measure of these follies\r\n    we are sent back to seek the truth. Women need a robuster courage\r\n    in the face of love, a greater faith in their womanhood, and in\r\n    the scheme of Life. Nothing can be gained from the child's folly\r\n    in breaking the toys that have momentarily ceased to please. The\r\n    misogamist type of woman cannot fail to prove as futile as the\r\n    misogamist man. Not 'Free _from_ man' is the watch-cry of women's\r\n    emancipation that surely is to be, but 'Free _with_ man.'\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex and intellectualism.]\r\n\r\nAnd further on the same author, considering the problem of the women of\r\nthe common type that are classified as a \"third sex,\" that of\r\ntemperamental neuter, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Economic conditions are compelling women to enter with men into\r\n    the fierce competition of our disordered social state. Partly due\r\n    to this reason, though much more, as I think, to the strong\r\n    stirring in woman of her newly-discovered self, there has arisen\r\n    what I should like to call an over-emphasized Intellectualism.\r\n    Where sex is ignored there is bound to lurk danger. Every one\r\n    recognizes the significance of the advance in particular cases of\r\n    women towards a higher intellectual individuation, and the social\r\n    utility of those women who have been truly the pioneers of the new\r\n    freedom; but this does not lessen at all the disastrous influence\r\n    of an ideal which holds up the renunciation of the natural rights\r\n    of love and activities of women, and thus involves an irreparable\r\n    loss to the race by the barrenness of many of its finest types.\r\n    The significance of such Intellectuals must be limited, because\r\n    for them the possibility of transmission by inheritance of their\r\n    valuable qualities is cut off, and hence the way is closed to a\r\n    further progress. And, thus, we are brought back to that simple\r\n    truth from which we started; there are two sexes, the female and\r\n    the male, on their specific differences and resemblances blended\r\n    together in union every true advance in progress depends--on the\r\n    perfected woman and the perfected man.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Young women misled by sexual pessimists.]\r\n\r\nOne who studies carefully the various aspects of the extreme feministic\r\nmovement must admit that there are many signs of the dangers which the\r\nabove quotations point out so clearly. Of course, we cannot believe in\r\nthe sincerity of all of the numerous women of thirty-five to fifty\r\nyears who pretend to ignore sex completely. Probably most of them have\r\ndiscovered that they have misunderstood themselves; but it is also\r\nprobable that they have discovered too late for making a readjustment\r\nin their own lives. However, it matters little whether such women have\r\nreally succeeded in ignoring sex. The real problem for educational\r\nattack lies in the fact that such women often succeed in proselyting\r\nyoung women under twenty-five, and these in turn may not come to see\r\nthe real truth about sex and life until ten or fifteen years later.\r\nClearly, organized education must protect young women against such\r\ninfluences.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The greatest good in sex-education.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest good which may come from the sex-education movement is not\r\nprevention or elimination of social diseases, it is not improved\r\nhealth, it is not general acceptance of the moral law of sex, it is not\r\none or all these that are devoutly to be hoped for; but far greater\r\nthan such possible results from sex-education, it will bring to many a\r\nman and woman a deeper, nobler, and purer knowledge of what sex means\r\nfor the coming race and of what it means now to each individual who\r\nrealizes life's fullest possibilities in conjugal affection which\r\nculminates in new life and new motives for more affection. Such an\r\nunderstanding of sex in relation to home life will help this old world\r\nmore than anything else which sex-education may accomplish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The greatest sex problem.]\r\n\r\nThe problems of sex and marriage deserve far more attention than can be\r\ngiven in this lecture. I am convinced that knowledge of sex in its\r\nphysical, psychical, social, and æsthetic aspects is the only sure\r\nfoundation for harmonious marriage under modern conditions. Therefore,\r\nI believe this to be the greatest sex problem open to educational\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. _The Eighth Problem for Sex-instruction: Eugenics_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meaning of eugenics.]\r\n\r\nEugenics, or the science of human good breeding, is just now the most\r\npopular of the problems concerning human sex and reproduction. In\r\nrecent years, the biological investigators of heredity have published\r\nsome startling facts which show that the human race must soon check its\r\nreckless propagation of the unfit and encourage reproduction by the\r\nbest types of men and women. This is not the place for a review of the\r\neugenic propositions. Those interested will find them in non-technical\r\nform in many books (see the bibliographical chapter of this book, page\r\n248).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eugenics in biology.]\r\n\r\nSome of the chief facts of eugenics should be a part of every\r\nwell-organized scheme of sex-instruction, and taught through biology (§\r\n17). Probably no other topic in biology is so likely to make an\r\nethical-social appeal, for the central point of eugenics is the\r\nresponsibility of the individual whose uncontrolled sexual actions may\r\ntransmit undesirable and heritable qualities and bring a train of\r\ndisaster to generations of descendants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of eugenics and sex-hygiene.]\r\n\r\nAt this point we digress to correct the widespread error in confusing\r\nsex-hygiene and eugenics. Many people who ought to know better use the\r\ntwo terms synonymously, perhaps because they are afraid of that\r\ncomparatively novel but frank prefix in \"sex-hygiene.\" The fact is that\r\neugenics and sex-hygiene have little in common. Eugenics is the\r\nscience of reproducing better humans by applying the established laws\r\nof genetics or heredity. In brief, it means, on the positive side,\r\nselecting desirable people as parents; and, negatively, preventing\r\npropagation by the undesirables. This is the sum total of the task of\r\neugenics in the accurate sense of the term.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Facts of heredity.]\r\n\r\nSo far as we know, each coming generation will inherit only qualities\r\nthat the parents inherited from their parents. It is a well-known\r\nprinciple of biology that changes in the bodies of human beings during\r\ntheir lifetime (dating from the fertilized egg that produces the\r\nindividual) are never in any noticeable degree inherited by\r\ndescendants. In short, acquired characteristics of the body tissues do\r\nnot influence the germ plasm, the living matter concerned with heredity\r\nand reproduction, but the germ plasm that determines what the next\r\ngeneration will inherit is fixed at birth. Thus tuberculosis,\r\nalcoholism, gonorrhea, and syphilis may be acquired during the life of\r\nan individual, but do not become fixed in the germ plasm. If the\r\ninfants show effects of any of these diseases, it is not because of\r\ntrue heredity but because they were infected or influenced before\r\nbirth. Rarely does this happen to children of a tuberculous mother, but\r\noften to those of a syphilitic mother. In a gonorrheal ophthalmia\r\nneonatorum (specific inflammation of infants' eyes) it is a case of\r\ninfection _during_ birth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-hygiene and eugenics parallel.]\r\n\r\nThus, it appears that sex-hygiene either personal or social (concerned\r\nwith venereal diseases) is not a part of eugenics. It is, however, a\r\nphase of euthenics, which deals with the environmental factors that\r\naffect the individual life. It is clear, then, that sex-hygiene (in the\r\nstrict medical sense) and eugenics are parallel and not conflicting.\r\nEugenics aims to select better parents who will transmit their own\r\nqualities genetically. Sex-hygiene in its personal and social aspects\r\nwill make healthier parents able to give their offspring a healthier\r\nstart in life, especially because the offspring is free from the\r\nprenatal effects of disease.\r\n\r\nThe teaching of heredity and eugenics is intended to develop a sense of\r\nindividual responsibility for the transmission of one's good or bad\r\ninherited qualities to offspring. The teaching of sex-hygiene, either\r\npersonal or social, looks towards improving personal health and\r\npreventing infection and injurious influence on the unborn next\r\ngeneration. Obviously, we need both sex-hygiene and eugenics as part of\r\nthe larger sex-instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. _Summary of Lectures on Sex Problems_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problems of health, attitude, and morals.]\r\n\r\nWe have made a general survey of the problems that offer reasons for\r\nsex-instruction. We have noted that some of the problems are concerned\r\nwith health and, hence, lie within the scope of sex-hygiene in the\r\nstrict sense of that term; but some of them have only the remotest\r\nrelation to health and hygiene. On the contrary, they relate to the\r\nethical, social, and æsthetic attitude of individuals towards sex and\r\nreproduction. Obviously, these touch problems not of sex health, but of\r\nsex morality. In their educational importance I believe them as great,\r\nperhaps even greater, than those of sex-hygiene. In fact, I have come\r\nto believe that many individuals can best solve all their own sexual\r\nproblems on the basis of moral and æsthetic attitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Many-sided instruction needed.]\r\n\r\nConsidering, as we have done, the sex problems in their many aspects,\r\nwe are forced to the conclusion that sex-education will prove adequate\r\nonly when it combines instruction from the several points of view. It\r\nmust be much more than the sex-hygiene with which the sex-instruction\r\nmovement started. We need sexual knowledge that will conserve health,\r\nthat will develop social and ethical and eugenic responsibility for\r\nsexual actions, that will lead to increased happiness as well as to\r\nimproved health, and that will give a nobler and purer view of life's\r\npossibilities. In all these lines in which sex influences human life\r\nprofoundly, sex-education holds out the hope of help towards a better\r\nlife for all who receive and apply its lessons.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In the _American Journal of Public Health_ for July, 1913, Dr.\r\nJohn S. Fulton, Director General of the XV International Congress on\r\nHygiene and Demography, criticized severely the extremely radical\r\nstatistics that were presented on charts at the sex-hygiene exhibit of\r\nthe Congress, and were later published in Wilson's \"Education of the\r\nYoung in Sex-hygiene.\"\r\n\r\n[2] There is danger in quoting to young men the estimates as to\r\nprevalence of social diseases and, therefore, of promiscuity. Fear of\r\nconsequences will not control one who is led to believe that he is\r\ndoing what most men do. (See Parkinson in _Educational Review_, Jan.\r\n1911, pp. 44-46.)\r\n\r\n[3] Many writers have discounted the value of warnings involved in\r\nsex-instruction concerning social disease (see especially Cabot's\r\npapers referred to in § 46, and Parkinson in _Educational Review_,\r\nJanuary, 1911).\r\n\r\n[4] Louise Creighton, in her excellent little book on \"The Social\r\nDisease and How to Fight It\" (Longmans), has well presented the\r\nproblems of social impurity from woman's point of view.\r\n\r\nDr. W.S. Hall, in \"Life's Problems,\" has given in a few pages the\r\nnecessary protective knowledge.\r\n\r\n[5] See \"The Sexual Necessity,\" by Drs. Howell and Keyes.\r\n\r\n[6] See also, Henderson's \"Education with Reference to Sex.\"\r\n\r\n[7] See chapter on \"Motherhood and Marriage\" in Foerster's \"Marriage\r\nand the Sex Problem.\"\r\n\r\n[8] As an illustration of this fact, out of 558 Pittsburgh\r\nprofessional prostitutes, 406 had never had children. Of the 152 who\r\nwere mothers, only 24 had two or more children.\r\n\r\n[9] Many thinking men and women now agree with Ellen Key that\r\n\"marriage is immoral without mutual love,\" that \"love is the sole\r\ndecisive point of view in questions concerning this relationship,\"\r\nthat \"it will come to pass that no finely sensitive woman will become\r\na mother except through mutual love,\" that \"everything which is\r\nexchanged between husband and wife in their life together can only be\r\nthe free gift of love, can never be demanded by one or the other as a\r\nright.\" (Key--\"The Morality of Woman.\")\r\n\r\n[10] Foerster, in his \"Marriage and the Sex Problem,\" urges that\r\nself-control over sexual passions is the working of the old idea of\r\nasceticism, which he believes \"should be regarded, not as a negation\r\nof nature nor as an attempt to extirpate natural forces, but as\r\npractice in the art of self-discipline. Its object should be to show\r\nhumanity what the human will is capable of performing, to serve as an\r\nencouraging example of the conquest of the spirit over the animal\r\nself.\" My personal view is that nothing is gained by confusing\r\nself-control and the old asceticism.\r\n\r\n[11] Misunderstood, it seems to me, because her philosophy demanding\r\nthat marriage begin with, exist with, and end with love means freedom\r\nin love, and this has been misinterpreted as \"free love\" in the sense\r\nof promiscuity. I know of no writer who stands for marriage on a\r\nhigher plane than that advocated by Ellen Key. Her lecture on\r\n\"Morality of Woman\" (Seymour Co., Chicago) is a good condensed\r\nstatement of her largest ideas and a helpful introduction to \"Love and\r\nMarriage.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION OF EDUCATIONAL ATTACK ON THE SEX PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. _The Task of Sex-education_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pragmatic solution of sex problems.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding series of lectures we have surveyed eight important\r\nsex problems that can never be solved, even in part, unless by\r\nwidespread information that specifically guides the individual and\r\norganized society in the adjustment of sexual instincts to the peculiar\r\nconditions that obtain in our modern civilized life. To spread the\r\nknowledge that will help civilized humanity on towards the best\r\npossible adjustment of sex and life, and therefore to a pragmatic\r\nsolution of sexual problems, is the task or the chief aim of\r\nsex-education.[12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No hope for complete solution.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constant advance towards ideals.]\r\n\r\nOf course, only the ultra-Utopian dreamer claims that sex-education can\r\nsolve all the sexual problems of civilized life, but even the most\r\npessimistic disbeliever in the new movement admits that knowledge of\r\nsexual life will be helpful to the great majority of people. Hence, it\r\nis worth while to organize the educational attack on the sex problems\r\nwhich we have considered in the preceding lectures. It seems to me that\r\nwe may gain an advantage by frankly admitting that the educational\r\nattack is not expected to solve all sex problems for all people, for by\r\nsuch admission we put to flight those shallow cynics who have opposed\r\nthe sex-education movement because they think (and probably correctly)\r\nthat immorality and social diseases and all other sexual disharmonies\r\nwill continue to exist as long as the human species does. Likewise,\r\nthere will be dishonesty and murder and preventable diseases and all\r\nother human troubles in spite of education; but the advancement of\r\nlearning has slowly and progressively reduced the sum total of all the\r\ndisharmonies of life until now civilized people are largely free from\r\nmany of the original or barbaric conditions. Along similar lines we may\r\nconfidently think of sex-education as making a constantly advancing and\r\nvictorious attack on the problems of life that have grown out of our\r\nprimitive sexual instincts. Sex-education, like all other education,\r\nstrives towards ideals that individuals and society may always approach\r\nbut may never reach. It is only another case of Emerson's advice,\r\n\"hitch your wagon to a star,\" which means the adoption of high ideals\r\nthat lead ever on and on towards better life.\r\n\r\nWith this understanding that _the task of sex-education is the\r\never-advancing improvement of sexual conditions in individual as well\r\nas in social life_, let us turn now to consider the possible lines for\r\ndefinite educational attack on the chief problems of sex. It will be\r\nmost helpful if we first analyze the general task of sex-education into\r\nsome specific aims that may definitely guide instruction, and then in\r\nlater lectures consider the methods and detailed subject matter of\r\nsex-instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. _The Aims of Sex-education_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Emphasis on social disease.]\r\n\r\nSince the revelations concerning the disastrous physical effects of\r\nsexual immorality, especially as it exists in the commercialized\r\nconditions of the social evil, have had the chief influence in\r\nawakening intelligent people from their age-long ignorance and\r\nindifference concerning the great sex problems, it was natural that\r\nthose who first proposed special instruction should have emphasized the\r\nsocial evil and its diseases so much as to create the widespread but\r\nerroneous impression that the great aim of sex-education is to teach\r\nthe distressing facts concerning the pathological consequences of\r\nimmorality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other problems need emphasis.]\r\n\r\nNow, without in the least underestimating the vast importance of the\r\nemphasis placed on sexual immorality and social diseases in the\r\nsplendid pioneer work of the late Dr. Morrow and others for the\r\nsex-education movement, and without suggesting that these topics should\r\nbe neglected while reorganizing the educational attack on sex problems,\r\nI believe that so far as formal instruction in homes, schools, and\r\ncolleges is concerned, we may gain a decided advantage if we now\r\nrecognize and declare boldly that the physical effects of the diseases\r\narising from the social evil constitute _only one of several_ groups of\r\nsex problems that organized education should attempt to solve.\r\n\r\nConcerning the other problems that sex-education should touch with\r\ngreat definiteness, it is my personal view that most of those outlined\r\nin the preceding lectures will be affected by instruction along five\r\nimportant lines, as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Five lines of instruction.]\r\n\r\n(1) The scientific truths that lead to serious and respectful attitude\r\non all sex questions. (2) The personal sex-hygiene that independent of\r\nsocial diseases conserves individual health directly or indirectly\r\nthrough sexual normality. (3) The ethical responsibility of individuals\r\nfor the physical or social or psychical harm of their sexual actions\r\nupon other individuals, _e.g._, in prostitution and illegitimacy. (4)\r\nThe hygienic, ethical, and psychical laws that promote physical and\r\nmental health in monogamic marriage. (5) The established principles of\r\nheredity and eugenics which foretell the possible coming of a better\r\nrace of humans. I believe that in these five lines there are\r\neducational problems of present and future greater significance to\r\nhuman health and happiness than are found in the social evil and its\r\ndiseases, commandingly important though these be. Therefore, in viewing\r\nthe field of sex-education with reference to the possible usefulness of\r\nknowledge in helping individuals solve the vital problems that have\r\ngrown naturally out of the reproductive function, I believe that we are\r\nlogical only when we organize our educational aims so as to give\r\nscientific instruction concerning the problems of sex in the several\r\nlines in addition to the physical or hygienic aspects of the social\r\nevil and its diseases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Four aims.]\r\n\r\nAs I now see in the large the sexual problems which scientifically\r\norganized education should attack, the educational aims may be grouped\r\nunder four general headings as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst and most important, sex-education should aim to develop an\r\nopen-minded, serious, scientific, and respectful attitude towards all\r\nproblems of human life which relate to sex and reproduction.\r\n\r\nSecond, sex-education should aim to give that knowledge of personal\r\nhygiene of the sexual organs which is of direct value in making for the\r\nmost healthful and efficient life of the individual.\r\n\r\nThird, sex-education should aim to develop personal responsibility\r\nregarding the social, ethical, psychical, and eugenic aspects of sex as\r\naffecting the individual life in its relation to other individuals of\r\nthe present and future generations; in short, sex-education should\r\nconsider the problems of sexual instincts and actions in relation to\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nFourth, sex-education should aim to teach _briefly_ to young people,\r\nduring later adolescence, the essential hygienic, social, and eugenic\r\nfacts regarding the two destructive diseases which are chargeable to\r\nsexual promiscuity or immorality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Order of importance of aims.]\r\n\r\nFor emphasis, let me briefly summarize these aims of sex-education: (1)\r\nSerious, scientific, and respectful attitude of mind on sex questions;\r\n(2) personal sex-hygiene; (3) social and ethical and eugenic\r\nresponsibility for sex actions; (4) relation of immorality and social\r\ndiseases. I have deliberately, placed these educational aims in this\r\norder because it is the order of greatest permanent importance in the\r\nsex-education movement; it represents the greatest value to the largest\r\nnumber of individuals who may learn the scientific truth; and it is the\r\norder most natural, most logical, and most effective in pedagogical\r\npractice with young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Relation of aims to problems of sex.]\r\n\r\nSex-education organized with regard to these four aims will touch\r\ndefinitely all the eight problems of sex that have been discussed in\r\npreceding lectures. The first aim will directly affect the problem of\r\nvulgarity and indirectly touch those stated under the third aim. The\r\nsecond aim is obviously directed to the problem of personal health as\r\nit may be influenced by the sexual processes of one individual\r\nindependent of others. Of course, there is also the personal aspect of\r\nsocial diseases, but it is clearer to consider both personal and social\r\naspects of these diseases as a unit in the fourth aim. The third aim is\r\nbased on five of the eight great problems which involve individual\r\nresponsibility for the social evil, for illegitimacy, for sexual\r\nimmorality, for matrimonial harmony, and for eugenics. The social\r\naspects of the venereal diseases obviously involve personal\r\nresponsibility of the individual in relation to society as well as a\r\npersonal hygienic problem. Thus, six of the eight great sex problems\r\nare essentially social and only those relating to personal hygiene and\r\nindividual attitude are so distinctly personal as to have only an\r\nindirect relation to other individuals, as might be true in case of\r\nunharmonious marriage of individuals who are vulgar minded or who have\r\nbeen injured by unhygienic personal habits. Finally, the fourth aim\r\nprovides for teaching the _essential_ facts that may help individuals\r\nprotect themselves directly, and society indirectly, against the\r\ndiseases that awakened the world to the need of sex-education.\r\n\r\nLet us turn now to analyze the aims of sex-education and consider how\r\nthey may be connected with a definite scheme for sex-instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. _The Aims as the Basis of Organized Sex-instruction_\r\n\r\nI have placed first the aim to develop a serious and respectful\r\nattitude toward sex and reproduction because at the root of the sexual\r\nproblems of our times is the prevailing vulgar interpretation of sex\r\nand life discussed in a preceding lecture (§ 11).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biology and attitude.]\r\n\r\nRecognizing the great importance of attitude, how may it be influenced\r\nby instruction in home or school? The most widely accepted answer is\r\nthat the best beginning may be made through study of biology (including\r\nbotany, zoölogy, and physiology) and through nature-study and hygiene\r\ntaught on a biologic basis. No other method of introduction to\r\nsex-instruction is so natural and so likely to lead to a serious,\r\nscientific, and open-minded attitude concerning sex. In fact, a large\r\npart of the study of reproduction of plants and animals in courses of\r\nbiology in schools and colleges has its value chiefly in the\r\noverwhelming evidence that problems of sex and reproduction are natural\r\nand dignified aspects of life. Such biological study determines\r\nattitude in no small degree. This is the chief justification for study\r\nof the reproductive processes in a series of animals and plants\r\nrepresenting stages between the complex development of the highest\r\nanimals which parallel human life and the lowest forms which the\r\nmicroscope reveals. In all my classes of twenty years in high school\r\nand college I have noted a marked development of serious, scientific,\r\nand open-minded attitude in response to natural and frank presentation\r\nof animal and plant life-histories. Moreover, I have many times\r\nrequested large groups of students to write freely and frankly\r\nconcerning the influence of biological courses upon their own attitude;\r\nand their papers have strongly supported my observation that study of\r\nanimal and plant life-histories exerts a profound influence upon the\r\nattitude of students towards the human problems of sex and\r\nreproduction. If I were stating a defense for biology as one of three\r\nor four essential science courses for general education, I should place\r\nthe greatest emphasis upon the study of animals and plants as a\r\nfoundation for sex-instruction. Certain critics would reply that all\r\nthe biological facts that are actually used in the direct human\r\napplication of sex-instruction could be taught in a few lectures\r\nwithout a year's course in biology; but it is a demonstrated fact that\r\na few isolated lessons do not give the attitude that comes from a good\r\ncourse of biology taught with the view to culminating in special\r\nsex-instruction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Literature and attitude.]\r\n\r\nOnly recently has it been pointed out that one's attitude towards sex\r\nmay be profoundly influenced by reading certain general literature that\r\nholds up high ideals of love and sex and life. It will be most\r\nconvenient to consider the influence of literature on sex-instruction\r\nin another lecture (§ 23).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teaching personal sex-hygiene.]\r\n\r\nNow let us consider the general bearings of the personal sex-hygiene\r\ndemanded by the second aim. For children under ten and twelve the\r\nnecessary hygiene should be presented personally (see § 25). For young\r\npeople of adolescent years there are four possible ways of instruction\r\nin personal sex-hygiene: (1) It may be added naturally to a course or\r\nseries of lessons in general hygiene including the problems of health\r\nfor all systems of organs. (2) It may be included in a study of\r\nvertebrate and human reproduction in a course of biology or zoölogy.\r\n(3) It may be presented by a special lecture that is independent of all\r\nregular courses of study. (4) Special booklets may be put into the\r\nhands of young people. Let us now examine each of these ways:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-hygiene in general hygiene.]\r\n\r\n(1) Sex-hygiene as a natural part of a series of lessons in general\r\nhygiene is most satisfactory when preceded by biological nature-study\r\nor high-school biology in which life-histories of organisms have been\r\nstudied for the sake of attitude. At present we lack satisfactory\r\ntextbooks for this kind of correlation. There is a strong reaction\r\nagainst independent courses of hygiene in high schools, and the next\r\nplan is becoming more common.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hygiene in biology.]\r\n\r\n(2) The inclusion of the necessary hygiene of all organs in courses of\r\nbiology or zoölogy that have emphasized physiology and its bearings on\r\nhealth is the best arrangement so far proposed and tested in practice.\r\nIt has been tried with success by Dr. W.H. Eddy in the High School of\r\nCommerce, New York City, and by other high-school teachers working\r\nalong the same lines. The arguments for teaching general hygiene on a\r\nbiological basis have been presented in the last chapter of \"The\r\nTeaching of Biology in Secondary Schools\" by Lloyd and Bigelow, and put\r\nin textbook form in the \"Applied Biology\" and \"Introduction to Biology\"\r\nby M.A. and Anna N. Bigelow. However, personal sex-hygiene is not\r\nincluded in these textbooks, because educational and public opinion do\r\nnot yet stand for such radical lessons in books for schools.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special lectures on hygiene.]\r\n\r\n(3) Special lectures on sex-hygiene independent of biology or general\r\nhygiene are at best makeshifts, and not without dangers. I fear the\r\neffect of the abrupt introduction to sex problems by special lectures,\r\nespecially for girls who may be shocked much more than the average boys\r\ncan be. I heartily sympathize with parents and school officials who\r\nobject to special lectures that suddenly focus attention on problems of\r\nsexual health. It seems to me that special lectures should be given\r\nonly when no other method of teaching is possible. This applies\r\nespecially to young people who are not in schools. While I have\r\nstressed biological nature-study as offering the ideal basis for the\r\nbroadest kind of sex-education, I realize that there are cases where\r\nsuch study cannot be held prerequisite to some aspects of sex-hygiene\r\nthat young people should know. However, we should aim to make such\r\ncases the exceptions and not the rule. Some good may be accomplished by\r\nteaching certain facts of sex-hygiene frankly and directly to those who\r\nhave absolutely no knowledge of nature-study and biology; but after\r\nwatching the reactions of groups of boys who were receiving such\r\ninformation, I have been convinced that even with a limit of one hour\r\nfor instruction a biological setting is decidedly important in that it\r\ngives an indirect approach.\r\n\r\n(4) Special books and pamphlets are useful when, and only when, the\r\nabove methods are impossible, but certain cautions are desirable (see §\r\n22).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difficulty in ethical-social teaching.]\r\n\r\nThe third aim involves some difficult educational problems. Since we\r\nconfess that we know so little concerning efficient methods for\r\nethical, moral, or social teaching, it is evident that we must be far\r\nfrom a satisfactory plan for dealing with instruction which is intended\r\nto oppose most powerful instinctive tendencies and long-established\r\nhabits of sensuality. Clearly the third aim sets no easy task for the\r\neducator; but since the possible solution of sex problems must turn on\r\nthe sex actions of the individual in relation to society, the\r\nethical-social aspects of sex-education must not be evaded because the\r\nway is not yet entirely clear. The fact is that a good beginning has\r\nbeen made, especially in teaching concerning social diseases, heredity,\r\nand eugenics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social hygiene and ethics.]\r\n\r\nThe value of all the proposed teaching concerning the relation of\r\nimmorality and social diseases is more ethical than hygienic. Read any\r\nof the standard literature on the social side of venereal diseases,\r\nespecially the masterly writings of the eminent physician and chief\r\norganizer of the American movement for sex-education, the late Dr.\r\nPrince A. Morrow, of New York City; and one notes that the medical\r\nfacts have bearings in two directions. First, they indicate the\r\ndesirability of morality as a protection of personal health; and\r\nsecond, they teach that the pathological results of the individual's\r\nimmoral living may be passed on later to innocent wives and children.\r\nThe first is as clearly personal hygiene as teaching that impure water\r\nmay cause typhoid; but the second is social hygiene and ethics. The\r\nsecond is more impressive to all but the most selfish people.\r\n\r\nThere is good reason for believing that information concerning the\r\nsocial diseases is more likely to impress the average young man through\r\nthe social-ethical appeal much more than as a matter of personal\r\nhealth. Therefore, a biological lesson on social diseases, which may be\r\npresented most logically in connection with other germ diseases, may\r\nhave its chief value in that its meaning is social and ethical.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biology and ethics.]\r\n\r\nAs another illustration of biology touching ethics, I have recently\r\ncome to believe that the teaching concerning heredity and eugenics,\r\nwhich should be a standard part of the best sex-instruction, has its\r\ngreatest value in the ethical appeal, and not in the direct biological\r\napplication of the laws of heredity which underlie eugenics. I realize\r\nthat this statement is likely to be disputed by those biologists who\r\nsee in eugenics only the possibility of controlling heredity so as to\r\npropagate better strains of humans, just as breeders of plants and\r\nanimals have produced better domesticated varieties. A biologist\r\nnaturally believes that the ultimate aim of eugenics is improvement\r\nof physical and psychical qualities; but considering the\r\nethical-social-biological complications of human sex-problems, it seems\r\nimprobable that any decided and extensive improvement is likely to\r\ncome if we continue to limit our interpretation of the principles of\r\neugenics to the purely biological standpoint of the breeder of plants\r\nand animals. Let me illustrate by some concrete facts from eugenics:\r\n\r\nThere is a widespread opinion among science teachers that high-school\r\nbiology should present some of the best established facts of heredity;\r\nand that these should be eugenically applied to human life by means of\r\nsuch illustrations as those afforded by the histories of certain\r\ndegenerate families, such as the well-known Jukes and Kallikaks. A\r\nbrief sketch of the history of the latter family, as described in Dr.\r\nGoddard's interesting book, \"The Kallikak Family\" (Macmillan), will\r\nmake clear my point as to the ethical appeal of eugenics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Eugenics and ethical teaching.]\r\n\r\nA young man of good ancestry broke the moral law about one hundred and\r\nforty years ago and became the father of an illegitimate son by a\r\nfeeble-minded mother. Of 480 descendants of this son, there have been\r\n46 normal, many immoral, many alcoholic and 143 feeble-minded. The same\r\nman who back in the revolutionary days made a moral mistake which led\r\nto such awful consequences, later married a woman of good family and\r\nbecame the progenitor of a second line of 496 descendants of whom 494\r\nhave been normal mentally, while two were affected by alliance with\r\nanother family; and all have been first-class citizens, many of them\r\nprominent in business, professions, etc.\r\n\r\nEven making due allowance for the depressing influence of the\r\nenvironment in which most of the down-and-out descendants in the\r\ndegenerate line lived, the comparison between the normal and the\r\nabnormal lines from the same ancestor gives the most convincing eugenic\r\nevidence that has been discovered in the human race. Doubtless it will\r\nlong be used as a basis for attempted biological control of the\r\npropagation of the unfit. Many similar cases of hereditary degeneracy\r\nare recorded in books on eugenics.\r\n\r\nSuch a eugenic record as that of this Kallikak family should be\r\nreviewed in every high school and college in connection with the topic\r\n\"heredity\" in a course of biology, for it will teach two important\r\nlessons: (1) The biological principle that defects, both physical and\r\nmental, are highly heritable, even for many generations; and (2) the\r\nethical responsibility for the sex actions of the individual who may\r\nstart a long train of human disaster that may visit the children unto\r\neven later than the third and fourth generations. The first lesson is a\r\npurely biological one which suggests the eugenic argument that\r\ndefective humans, like undesirable animals and plants, should not take\r\npart in the perpetuation of the species. The second lesson is not\r\nbiological but ethical, suggesting individual responsibility for\r\nconduct which may disastrously affect other individuals' lives. It\r\nseems to me that so far as general education is concerned, the ethical\r\nlesson is the more impressive and more likely to lead to voluntary\r\neugenic practice by individuals. It is my observation that even many\r\nintelligent people are not seriously impressed by the biological\r\nevidences for eugenics considered as a general problem, but their\r\nreaction is one of interest when one begins to present the question of\r\nethical responsibility for the transmission of physical and mental\r\ndefects to future generations. Such considerations have led me to the\r\nview, already suggested, that eugenic studies in courses of biology\r\nhave their greatest practical value in their ethical implications,\r\nwhich, of course, by influencing individual responsibility for\r\nreproduction may lead to the desirable biological improvement of the\r\nhuman race. Teachers of biology should present, as an economic problem,\r\nthe facts which will make better breeds of plants and animals by direct\r\napplication of the biological laws of heredity; but they should present\r\nand apply parallel facts to human life in order to influence first of\r\nall individual responsibility for ethical control of reproductive\r\nactivity, and thus indirectly work eugenically for an improved human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Aim of eugenics.]\r\n\r\nThus the aim of eugenics is most likely to be attained through ethical\r\nrather than biological application of the teaching which our schools\r\ncan give. The men and women who view life selfishly with no feelings of\r\nethical responsibility towards others of the present or future will\r\ntake no practical interest in the biological problems of human\r\neugenics, although the economic problems of plant and animal breeding\r\nmay interest some of these same people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Education and other aspects of sex problems.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ethical-social bearings of biological teaching, our\r\nsex-education will be incomplete until we learn how to attack the sex\r\nproblems directly and effectively with reference to the ethical,\r\nsocial, psychical, and æsthetic aspects. Perhaps we may be able to do\r\nthis only with mature people; probably it is too much to hope that even\r\na serious impression will be made on all intelligent people; but\r\nsomehow sex-education must be completed by adequate presentation of\r\nthese aspects, for the problems of sex are satisfactorily solved only\r\nin the lives of those fortunate individuals whose vision of the\r\nrelation of sex and life combines the viewpoints of biology, hygiene,\r\npsychology, ethics, religion, and last--but far from least--æsthetics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Only essential knowledge of social diseases.]\r\n\r\nFinally, the educational application of the fourth aim demands some\r\nexplanation. Sometime in the adolescent period all young people should\r\nlearn the essential facts regarding the two social diseases and their\r\nrelation to immoral living. There is the widespread impression that\r\nthose advocating sex-education believe in giving great prominence to\r\nthe social diseases; but in opposition to this I cite the report of a\r\ncommittee of the American Federation for Sex Hygiene, published in the\r\n_Journal of the Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis_, January,\r\n1913, and later reprinted as a pamphlet by the American Social Hygiene\r\nAssociation. In that report there are _twenty-three_ recommendations\r\nconcerning sex-instruction; but _only_ one mentions social diseases\r\nand in these words: \"During the later period of adolescence ... there\r\nshould be given ... special instruction as to the character and dangers\r\nof the venereal diseases.\" That seems sufficient. It is not desirable\r\nthat young people should review the horrible facts relating to\r\nperverted sexuality. Ten or twenty brief and authoritative statements\r\nquoted impressively from medical and social literature ought to give\r\nfair warning of lurking dangers in immoral living. More extensive\r\ninformation has often proved dangerous. I would gladly advocate that\r\nthis dark side of life be kept in sealed books if I did not know that\r\nso many young people need forewarning and definite guidance. Our\r\neducational system will not do its full duty if it fails to offer the\r\nneeded help so that it may be obtained by all adolescent young people\r\nwho are not so fortunate as to be guided by parents and other personal\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] To avoid misunderstanding, let me repeat from the first lecture\r\nthat I am constantly thinking of sex-education in the larger sense;\r\nand instruction in schools can be, at best, only a part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTHE TEACHER OF SEX-KNOWLEDGE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. _Who Should Give Sex-instruction?_\r\n\r\nA large number of people have been convinced that young people need\r\nknowledge which will help them face the great problems of sex; but they\r\nwithhold their approval of the sex-education movement because they are\r\nnot satisfied that proper teachers exist. It is, therefore, evident\r\nthat we cannot make permanent progress by emphasizing the need of\r\nsex-education unless we can give assurance that qualified teachers are\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The teacher most important.]\r\n\r\nThe situation as regards teachers of sex-instruction is very different\r\nfrom that of all other subjects concerning which young people should be\r\ntaught. We cannot safely plan the teaching regarding sex until we know\r\nthe teacher. This will be evident, I think, after some general\r\nconsiderations concerning selection of teachers and some discussion of\r\nproblems such as the first teacher, teachers for classes, and some\r\nundesirable teachers. The general rule should be, first, find the safe\r\nand sure teacher and, second, select the facts and plan the lessons\r\nthat the chosen teacher may give effectively.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teachers of same sex for children.]\r\n\r\nSo far as young children are concerned, the needed instruction is so\r\ngeneral in character that the sex of the competent teacher is of little\r\nimportance, but the information that ought to prepare for and guide\r\nthrough the mazes of adolescent youth should come to young people from\r\nteachers of the same sex. If exceptions must be made rather than omit\r\ninstruction altogether, some very mature women may safely guide both\r\nboys and girls through adolescence; but men, even physicians, should\r\nnot undertake instruction of adolescent young women, unless parents and\r\nother mature people are present to help with attitude. That women may\r\nwell instruct boys I know, because the most impressive sex lecture I\r\never heard was given by the late Dr. Mary Wood-Allen to the boys of the\r\nfreshman class when I was a college student. But note that I have said\r\n\"some very mature women.\" The fact is that I fear danger for some boys\r\nif they are frankly instructed by attractive young women who are only\r\nten to fifteen years older than their pupils. Hence, I urge great\r\ncaution if there must be any exceptions to the general rule that\r\nteachers and pupils should be of the same sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Coeducational classes.]\r\n\r\nI realize the difficulty of applying this rule in many high schools\r\nwhere the foundations of sex-education are well laid on the biological\r\nbasis. There is no reason why the biological studies should not be\r\ncoeducational through nature-study and biology as far as the\r\ndevelopment of frogs and birds and, in a general way, of mammals. In\r\nfact, both of my textbooks, the \"Applied Biology\" and the \"Introduction\r\nto Biology,\" which emphasize reproduction of organisms more than other\r\nhigh-school books, have been used throughout in coeducational classes.\r\nHowever, these books stop where the problems of human life begin and\r\nshould be supplemented by lessons for sex-limited classes. There are\r\nwriters who suggest that segregation of the sexes for teaching\r\nconcerning human life may be at present a necessity because complete\r\nfrankness on sexual questions is certainly obstructed by tradition; but\r\nwe must not ignore the deep social reasons why, in general, there must\r\nbe maintained a certain amount of reserve between the sexes in the\r\nconsideration of some important problems of life. No educational theory\r\nor practice can possibly alter the fundamental physical or psychical\r\nrelations of the sexes which nature seems to have fixed immutably.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Married women as teachers.]\r\n\r\nOne other point that deserves attention in this connection is the\r\ncommon statement that only married women, preferably mothers, can be\r\ncompetent instructors of young women. This strikes me as more than\r\nabsurd. Personal experience is not always necessary for teaching in any\r\nline. The greatest medical teachers have not had the diseases they\r\ndescribe so clearly. The best elementary teachers and specialists on\r\nthe care of children are not always mothers; on the contrary, some of\r\nthese are men. The fact is that these teachers have learned, not from\r\npersonal experience, but from the great accumulations of scientific\r\nknowledge of medicine, hygiene, and education. There is an abundance of\r\nsuch knowledge relating to sex that may be clearly understood by bright\r\nwomen who have no bi-personal knowledge of sex. Therefore, I believe\r\nthat it is nonsense to insist that only women with complete sexual\r\nexperiences can be efficient guides for other women.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. _The Child's First Teachers of Sex-knowledge_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mothers and other first teachers.]\r\n\r\nThe first instruction which may begin to lay the foundation for the\r\nindividual's sex-education should be given in early childhood by\r\nparents, or by other adults, who happen to be on the most intimate\r\npersonal terms with the child. Usually this means the mother; but there\r\nare numerous cases of teachers, governesses, grandmothers, and even\r\nfathers who have greater personal influence with certain children than\r\ntheir mothers have. The essential point is that the child should be\r\ninstructed only by an adult who can exert the greatest personal\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mothers and adolescent boys.]\r\n\r\nMany parents who believe in sex-education for their children hold that\r\nthe mothers should give all necessary hygienic guidance and teach the\r\nelementary facts of life to the children of both sexes in the\r\npre-adolescent years, but that with the dawn of adolescence the girls\r\nshould continue to be instructed by their mothers, while the boys\r\nshould be guided by their fathers. So far as girls are concerned, this\r\nseems to be a fairly good plan; but nine times out of ten it is not\r\nbest for the boys for several reasons: First, the sudden change of\r\nattitude on the part of the mother will surely impress upon the boy\r\nthat there is something about sex in boys that even his mother dares\r\nnot talk over with him. At about this same time when the mother begins\r\nto avoid the sex question with her boy, he will surely begin to get\r\nvulgar information and impressions from his boy companions. He will in\r\nall probability begin to hear the impure and obscene stories and vulgar\r\nlanguage that are so common among many men and boys, and he will be\r\nsure to learn that the vulgarity which he hears must not be repeated in\r\nthe presence of his mother and sisters. It is a most critical time in\r\nthe mental attitude of the boy. His mother has so far been directing\r\nhim towards purity and then suddenly sets him adrift. If there is ever\r\na time in a boy's life when he needs intimacy with his mother, it is in\r\nthe early adolescent years of twelve to fourteen. A strong mother's\r\nheart to heart guidance at that time will influence the boy more than\r\nall the sex-education which the schools and colleges combined can ever\r\nhope to offer. Such is the problem of home teaching for adolescent\r\nboys. I emphatically protest against the foolish and even dangerous\r\nidea that because a boy is beginning to metamorphose into a man his\r\nmother should cease to help him with the problems of sex. Lucky is that\r\nadolescent boy whose mother realizes her duty and her opportunity and\r\nholds him as intimately as if he were a girl of corresponding age.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Selecting Teachers for Class Instruction_\r\n\r\nThe references to \"the teacher\" in the following are primarily\r\napplicable to those who may be called upon to give sex-instruction as\r\nclass work in schools, colleges, churches, the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A.,\r\nand other educational organizations.\r\n\r\nThe chief question for discussion in this lecture is that of selecting\r\nthe teacher of those phases of sex-instruction that are directly\r\nrelated to human life, that is, personal sex-hygiene and sex-ethics. So\r\nfar as biological facts of sex are concerned, there are no special\r\nproblems such as may not be handled by teachers of biology in general\r\naccording to the accepted methods (see Lloyd and Bigelow, \"Teaching of\r\nBiology in the Secondary School\" and Bigelow, \"Teacher's Manual of\r\nBiology\").\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regular teachers if possible.]\r\n\r\nAs already suggested, a large part of the sex-instruction is simply an\r\nextension of biological science, hygiene, and ethics; and in secondary\r\nschools and colleges should be given by selected teachers of the\r\nregular staff and whenever possible as a part of regular courses. There\r\nmay be some necessary modifications to this plan; for example, in\r\nTeachers College the course on sex-education and another series of\r\nlectures on sex-physiology and hygiene for women are open to students\r\nwho do not take the biology courses in which the sex-instruction\r\nlogically belongs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-hygiene and ethics.]\r\n\r\nThe culminating stages of any complete scheme for formal sex-education\r\nof young people will be sex-hygiene considered in its strict sense as\r\nthat special phase of sex-education which deals with problems of\r\nhealth, and sex-ethics which determines the responsibility of\r\nindividuals for control of sexual instincts. While nature-study and\r\nbiology and general hygiene may be organized so as to present the major\r\nportion of the facts which should be included in a complete scheme of\r\nsex-instruction in schools and colleges, the application of these facts\r\nto personal life is the most difficult problem of sex-education. In\r\nfact, it is the only real problem, for long before sex-education became\r\na definite movement the most efficient science teachers were presenting\r\nthe fundamental facts on which we now propose to build with certain\r\nhygienic and ethic instruction which directly touches the personal life\r\nof the student. As already said, the human application will require\r\nonly a few lessons, preferably in connection with nature-study,\r\nbiology, ethics, or hygiene. But although brief, such instruction is\r\nthe keystone in the arch of sex-education, and it is very important\r\nthat there be no serious mistakes in selecting the teachers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex specialists not desirable.]\r\n\r\nI have mentioned special teachers as necessary for instruction with\r\ndirect reference to specialists human life. I hasten to add that I\r\nstill agree with the report of the special committee (Morrow, _et al._)\r\nof the American Federation for Sex Hygiene that it is not desirable\r\nthat any teacher should make a specialty of this type of instruction\r\nand of no other. We do not want \"sex specialists\" in the schools (see\r\npp. 10 and 20-23 of the Report of the Committee). It is important that\r\nall teachers should have general information regarding the sex problems\r\nof young people in order to be able to help individual pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. _Certain Undesirable Teachers for Special Hygienic and Ethical\r\nInstruction_\r\n\r\nIt will be most helpful if we consider the problem of selecting\r\nteachers with a view to rejecting those who certainly should not\r\nundertake the special hygienic and ethical teaching, for teachers who\r\nare good in other subjects and who are fortunately free from certain\r\ndisqualifications discussed in the following, may by means of study\r\nadapt themselves for the final and most important stages of\r\nsex-education.\r\n\r\nThere are five types of teachers who should be regarded as disqualified\r\nfor teaching personal sex-hygiene and sex-ethics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embarrassed teachers.]\r\n\r\nFirst, those men and women who are unable to speak of sex-hygiene as\r\ncalmly and seriously as they do of any other phase of hygiene had\r\nbetter not undertake the instruction of young people. There are many\r\nsuch men and women among teachers who, so far as scientific training is\r\nconcerned, ought to be good teachers of sex-hygiene. As an illustration\r\nof this attitude that leaves the wrong impression with students, it is\r\nreported that a good teacher of hygiene recently prefaced a brief talk\r\nto college girls as follows: \"I shall now consider a process that no\r\ncultured woman ever mentions except with bated breath. I refer to\r\nmenstruation.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abnormal teachers.]\r\n\r\nThe second kind of people who should not teach sex-hygiene are the men\r\nand women who are the unfortunate victims of sexual abnormality, either\r\nphysical or psychical, that more or less influences their outlook on\r\nlife. Certain neurotic and hysterical men or women who lack thorough\r\nphysiological training and whose own sexual disturbances have led them\r\nto devour omnivorously and unscientifically the psychopathological\r\nliterature of sex by such authors as Havelock Ellis, Krafft-Ebing, and\r\nFreud, are probably unsafe teachers of sex-hygiene. Especially is this\r\ntrue of the women of this type whose introspective morbidity has led\r\nthem to diagnose their own functional disturbances as the direct result\r\nof \"over-sexuality\" and restraint from normal sexual expression--a\r\ndiagnosis that is probably wrong nine times in ten cases. Such a woman\r\nis a very dangerous teacher of sex-hygiene for adolescent girls; and a\r\npositive menace to older unmarried women who, if free from absorbing\r\nwork, may spend their leisure in becoming more or less restless under\r\nthe unsocial, if not unphysiologic, conditions of unwelcome celibacy.\r\nThis is no imaginary danger. The reader of this will not be interested\r\nin details, but the author has received from physicians and others\r\nreliable information concerning several extremely abnormal women of the\r\nabove-described type who are taking an active interest in the\r\nsex-instruction of young people and are actually suggesting to their\r\nfriends among young women the dangerous and untrue doctrine that\r\nprolonged celibacy for women results in repressed sexuality that surely\r\nleads to ill health. Such ideas, it is true, are traceable to certain\r\nwell-known radical writers on the psychopathology of sex; but we must\r\nremember that the great majority of physicians and other scientific\r\ninvestigators who have studied such problems refuse to believe that\r\nrepressed sex instincts in either men or women do the harm that a few\r\nextremists have claimed. But even if it were known beyond the shadow of\r\na doubt that repressed sex instincts may injure people, it would be\r\nunwise to intrust young people to instruction by teachers who have a\r\nhypochondriacal interest in such a doctrine of repression. Such\r\nsuggestions can do only harm to the vast majority of persons who\r\nreceive them. To say the least, it is unfortunate that the\r\npsychopathology of sex has become so widely circulated among those who\r\nare not well trained in physiology and psychiatry.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teachers who emphasize sexual abnormality.]\r\n\r\nThe third kind of people who should not be intrusted with teaching\r\nsex-hygiene are the men and women who, without a scientific\r\nperspective, have plunged into the literature of sexual abnormality\r\nuntil they have come to think that knowledge concerning perverted life\r\nis an important part of sex-education for young people, especially for\r\nthose of post-adolescent years. I know of teachers and physicians who\r\nadvise young people not much over twenty years of age to read such\r\npsychopathological works as those of Krafft-Ebing, Ellis, and Freud,\r\nand various works dealing with commercialized vice. Here is a grave\r\ndanger. The less that people without professional use for knowledge of\r\nsexual pathology know concerning it, the better it will be for their\r\npeace of mind and possibly for their morals. Therefore, I urge that he\r\nwho enthusiastically studies the abnormalities of sex life without\r\nreference to scientific research or professional demands, is not likely\r\nto be the kind of teacher who will present abnormal life only so far as\r\nis necessary to an understanding of the perfectly normal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pessimistic teachers.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth kind of people who ought not to instruct the young in\r\npersonal problems of sex-hygiene are the men and women whose own\r\nunhappy romances or married life, or whose knowledge of vice\r\nconditions, have made them pessimistic concerning sex-problems. There\r\nare in our schools and colleges to-day some such men and many such\r\nwomen, and there will be danger for young people when the growing\r\nfreedom of expression allows these sexual pessimists to impress their\r\nown hopeless philosophy of sex upon students. The educational world\r\ndoes not need such teachers, but rather those who can follow the late\r\nDr. Morrow in seeing a bright side of life that almost dispels the\r\ndarkness of sexual errors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teachers not respected by pupils.]\r\n\r\nThe fifth kind of persons who ought not to teach the personal side of\r\nsex-hygiene are those who cannot command the most serious respect of\r\ntheir pupils. This applies especially to many men teachers whose\r\nflippant attitude and even questionable living are not likely to help\r\ntheir pupils, especially boys, towards a satisfactory interpretation of\r\nsex problems. Of course, such teachers ought not be in schools at all,\r\nbut the fact is that for various reasons they sometimes get there and\r\nstay there; and so they must be weighed by the school official who\r\nselects the teachers to be intrusted with special problems of\r\nsex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No instruction without satisfactory teachers.]\r\n\r\nSummarizing, I have in this lecture aimed to warn the school\r\nadministrator, and others who must select teachers of classes, against\r\nthe kinds of teachers who ought not be chosen for presenting the\r\nspecial problems of sex-education, especially those of sex-hygiene and\r\nsex-ethics. I have pointed out that there are five serious\r\ndisqualifications; and it is probable that if strictly applied when\r\nchoosing teachers for special sex-instruction, there will be\r\nelimination of three or four in every ten of those whose training in\r\nscience might be expected to qualify them as teachers of this special\r\nline. It is a fair question as to what a school or other institution\r\nshould do if it has no teachers who are free from the above\r\ndisqualifications. My own belief is that it is better to get an\r\noutsider for the handling of the special problems. If this is\r\nimpracticable, then suggest to the students that they read certain\r\nbooks such as are recommended in the last sections of this book. Even\r\nentire omission of the study of the personal and social aspects of\r\nsex-hygiene and sex-ethics is far wiser than intrusting a class to a\r\nteacher with one or more of the negative qualifications that we have\r\nbeen considering in this lecture. The effect of sex-education upon\r\nindividual lives will in no small degree depend upon the impression\r\nmade by the living teacher who deals with the difficult problems of sex\r\nin relation to hygiene and ethics. Hence, the greatest care should be\r\ntaken when selecting the teacher for this all-important part of the\r\nstudent's sex-education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nBOOKS AS TEACHERS CONCERNING SEX AND LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. _Value and Danger of Special Sex Books for Young People_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books for private reading.]\r\n\r\nThere are many parents and teachers who believe that young people\r\nshould get their sexual information by private reading, and numerous\r\nbooks for boys and girls have been prepared to meet such a demand. The\r\ndesire for such \"private\" reading undoubtedly exists, especially in\r\nboys; but this is part of the general air of secrecy and vulgarity that\r\nhas enshrouded the truth about sexual matters. Many eminent physicians\r\nagree that there are elements of physical and perhaps moral danger when\r\na boy reads a sex-science book secretly, but that there are few such\r\npossibilities in frank and scientific teaching by a competent\r\ninstructor. This is recognized by leaders in the Y.M.C.A., and they\r\nprefer to read books with the boys in study classes. Many scientific\r\nwomen think there is no such danger for average girls, but agree that\r\ngirls as well as boys will gain in respect for the subject of sex if\r\nthe atmosphere of secrecy can be avoided. Hence, while books for\r\nprivate reading are better than ignorance, they alone will not solve\r\nmany of the problems at which sex-education is directed. We must cease\r\nto foster the secrecy created by an atmosphere of obscenity, and the\r\nstudy of sex must be brought into the light of day. Let good books be\r\nrecommended through parents and with their approval be issued freely by\r\nlibraries and without restrictions which suggest something dark and\r\nwrong. Let parents and teachers encourage such reading, but not as\r\nsomething requiring secrecy. Rather let such books be read as freely as\r\nany other good books, and let parents and competent teachers follow the\r\nyoung readers closely so as to explain facts and help develop the\r\ndesirable attitude of mind. Especially let parents encourage the idea\r\nthat approved sex-science books may be read at the family fireside as\r\nproperly as any other books. Above all, let parents and teachers work\r\nin every possible way against the time-worn idea that problems of sex\r\nare essentially vulgar and demand secrecy even in scientific study. We\r\nmust have a nobler and healthier outlook on human life than that which\r\nso commonly prevails, and we can never get it by secret study of\r\nsex-science by young people. Such study may do some good by warning\r\nagainst unhygienic habits and social diseases; but it is certainly\r\ninadequate to give the open-minded attitude needed so much for\r\nappreciating the ethical, social, and æsthetic bearings of human life\r\nas it is influenced by normal sexual functions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pamphlets _vs._ books.]\r\n\r\nIt has been urged by well-known teachers that, for sex-instruction,\r\npamphlets are better than books in that they do not hold the attention\r\ntoo long on topics that may be exciting to some young people. On the\r\nother hand, books usually make a stronger appeal, while pamphlets are\r\nlikely to be regarded lightly, as are magazines and newspapers. There\r\nis no doubt that most sex books for young people are too extended, and\r\nthere is need of condensed forty-and fifty-cent booklets in place of\r\nthe books commonly sold at one dollar. Three or four small booklets by\r\ndifferent authors read at widely separated intervals will interest and\r\ninfluence a young man more than one large and comprehensive book. There\r\nis besides great value in the points of view of various authors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Better books needed.]\r\n\r\nAt present there are no thoroughly satisfactory books for adolescent\r\nboys and girls. In my opinion, W.S. Hall's books for boys are the most\r\nreliable, and his \"Life Problems\" is the best selection of facts for\r\ngirls; but some mature readers criticize the style of presentation.\r\nSome other books for adolescent young people are mentioned with\r\ncritical notes in the bibliography at the end of this book. There is\r\nstill plenty of chance for authors to experiment in writing books of\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23. _General Literature and Sex Problems_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex in literature.]\r\n\r\nIn the world's best literature there is much that teaches important\r\nlessons in the field of the larger sex-education. In the guise of love,\r\nsex problems have always held the prominent place in all literature.\r\nMany a great book teaches direct or positive lessons by holding up high\r\nideals for inspiration and imitation; but some of the most impressive\r\nlessons are in negative form, especially in fiction that deals with the\r\ntragedies of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious books.]\r\n\r\nAs examples of literature of direct influence in helping many young\r\npeople solve the problems of sex, we think first of that which holds up\r\nhigh ideals of personal purity, such as the Bible and other religious\r\nbooks. There is no doubt that such literature has a tremendous\r\ninfluence on many young people; but it has little influence on others,\r\nprobably in part because the somewhat mystical style of most religious\r\nwritings is meaningless to many people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appeal of poetry.]\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that many young people who refuse to be interested in\r\nreligious literature may be influenced for sexual purity by the\r\nemotional appeal of some general literature. This is especially true of\r\nromantic poetry. I believe that the high \"idealism\" of love inspired by\r\nTennyson's \"The Princess\" and \"Idylls of the King,\" by Longfellow's\r\n\"Evangeline\" and \"The Hanging of the Crane,\" by some of Shakespeare's\r\nplays, and by other great poetry with similar themes has had and will\r\ncontinue to have greater influence on the attitude and ethics of many\r\nyoung people than all the formal sex-teaching that can be organized.\r\nHence, I believe that teachers of literature should be led to take\r\ninterest in the larger sex-education to the end that by selection and\r\ninterpretation of great masterpieces they may contribute in a valuable\r\nway to the solution of some of the problems that have their center in\r\nthe deeper nature of sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Importance of interpretation.]\r\n\r\nInterpretation of literature by teachers is very important for the\r\npurposes of sex-education of young people. As an example, take\r\nTennyson's \"Idylls of the King,\" whose movement centers in the life\r\nproblems that turn around love. The average reader is likely to miss\r\nthe great lessons if the poem is not critically interpreted either by\r\nliving teachers or by such critical essays as those by Henry van Dyke\r\nin his \"Poetry of Tennyson\" and Newell Dwight Hillis in his \"Great\r\nBooks as Life-Teachers.\" Without interpretation \"The Idylls\" may teach\r\nfalse as well as true lessons of life. Some of the Knights of the Round\r\nTable (Galahad and Percivale) were worthy followers of the good and\r\npure King Arthur, and some of them (like Lancelot and Tristram and\r\nMerlin) proved unable to live up to the vow of chastity to which Arthur\r\nswore all his knights. And on the part of the ladies of Arthur's court,\r\nthere was purity and devotion and true womanhood in Elaine and Enid,\r\nwhile Guinevere and Ettarre and Vivien were unchaste and faithless. In\r\nfact, all phases of the relations of men and women in the struggles and\r\nperplexities of life are pictured; and therefore it is important that a\r\nwell-trained teacher should be the guide and interpreter if the \"Idylls\r\nof the King\" are to be read with the idea of understanding their true\r\nbearings on life, which includes their contribution to the larger\r\nsex-education.\r\n\r\nI have used \"The Idylls of the King\" as an illustration because they\r\nare so many-sided in sex problems; but much other great literature may\r\nbe made to help young people to high ideals of relationships between\r\nmen and women. I have emphasized the place of such literature in the\r\nlarger sex-education because I have come to believe that interpretation\r\nof life either real or in great literature may have profound influence\r\nin the development of one's philosophy of life. As a matter of\r\neducational procedure insuring that young people will learn to\r\ninterpret life, especially those aspects that the larger sex-education\r\ntouches so definitely, there appears to be no more natural and\r\nunobtrusive way of approach than that offered by the study of\r\nliterature. I am convinced that many teachers of literature may be\r\nefficient workers in the cause of the larger sex-education,\r\nsupplementing the scientific teaching in the ethical lines where\r\nscience is admittedly weak, if not helpless. It is to be hoped that\r\nnumerous teachers will soon grasp this opportunity. If they will study\r\nthe sex-education movement in order to get its general bearings and\r\nwill teach the sex aspect of literature on a basis of high ideals of\r\nlife and love, we need have no fear as to the culmination of the\r\ninstruction which properly begins with study of the biological facts of\r\nlife in its sexual aspects and leads on and on to its climax in the\r\nethical aspects of the individual's sex life in relation to other\r\nindividuals, that is, to society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not to be labeled \"sex-education.\"]\r\n\r\nI take it for granted that no teacher of literature who contributes to\r\nsex-instruction will let the students know that the emphasis placed on\r\ngreat life problems is part of a conspiracy of parents and educators to\r\ngive in the name of sex-education instruction that will help prepare\r\nthe individual for facing the problems. Here, as elsewhere, the young\r\npeople had better be left unaware that their elders are so interested\r\nin giving them instruction regarding sex problems that they have\r\norganized, for study of ways and means, a movement known as\r\nsex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex tragedies of fiction.]\r\n\r\nThe abundant literature that points to the moral to be drawn from\r\nsexual tragedies has doubtless influenced thousands of young people. I\r\nhave talked with many educated people who confessed to having been\r\nprofoundly influenced by such books as Eliot's \"Adam Bede,\" Hawthorne's\r\n\"Scarlet Letter,\" Goethe's \"Faust,\" Hardy's \"Tess of the\r\nd'Urbervilles.\" One might go on and compile an extensive bibliography,\r\nfor fiction of all languages of all times is full of the errors into\r\nwhich insistent sex instincts have drawn men and women who were not\r\nmasters of themselves. All standard fiction in which sexual errors and\r\ntheir penalties are associated may do good as a part of the larger\r\nsex-education, but the teacher should make sure that the young readers\r\narrive at the correct interpretation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fiction without a moral.]\r\n\r\nAgainst that type of fiction which presents sex problems that do not\r\nclearly \"point a moral,\" the average so-called \"problem novel\" of\r\nrecent time, there should be general opposition by workers for the\r\nlarger sex-education. Many of the modern novels and magazine stories\r\nseem to introduce sexual situations for the same reason that Boccaccio\r\ndid in some of his tales, namely, the attractiveness of lasciviousness.\r\nUnlike the commendable novels, it is characteristic of the equivocal\r\nones that no penalty is demanded or paid and no moral conclusion is\r\nsuggested. In fact, the way is very often left open to an immoral\r\ninterpretation. All such literature certainly tends to work against the\r\naims of sex-education. Perhaps parents and teachers may coöperate to\r\nkeep much of this kind of literature out of the hands of young people,\r\nbut the safest procedure is in cultivating taste for literature that\r\ndoes teach helpful lessons of life. If young people do read books and\r\nmagazines that seem to stand for uncertain morals, it is best that\r\nparents and teachers should point out the moral interpretations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24. _Dangers in Literature on Abnormal Sexuality_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger in present interests in the abnormal.]\r\n\r\nThe opinion is spreading among those who are studying the educational\r\nproblems relating to sex that there is great danger, even for many\r\nadults, in much of the literature describing psychopathological and\r\nabnormal social-sexual facts. There are enormous quantities of such\r\nliterature, particularly concerning the social evil. It is extremely\r\ndoubtful whether the reader who is not directly engaged in medicine,\r\npsychiatry, or social reform will profit by filling his mind with facts\r\nfrom the darkest side of life. No doubt it is important that all\r\nintelligent men and women should know enough about sexual immorality\r\nand the life of the underworld so that they will realize the necessity\r\nof protecting young people from vice in all its forms; but this does\r\nnot mean that everybody should read extensively in the mass of printed\r\nmatter that sets forth the most awful details concerning human\r\ndepravity. There is a real danger in this line. The sex-education\r\nmovement has already brought the problems of sex out of the old-time\r\nsecrecy, and no other topics of the times are so freely read and\r\ndiscussed. This might be well if the reading and discussion always took\r\nconstructive lines leading towards improvement of sexual relationships;\r\nbut unfortunately, much of the present popular interest in sexual\r\nproblems seems to be a morbid craving for the abnormal. We find this\r\ntendency in the demand for a certain type of sex-problem novels, we\r\nsee it frequently on the stage and in motion pictures, and we hear it\r\nin general conversation. The advertised suggestion of sexual immorality\r\nin a forthcoming serial novel often raises surprisingly the circulation\r\nof certain magazines. A few hints of sexual irregularity in certain\r\nplays have brought crowded audiences. A scandalous divorce case,\r\nreported as freely as the law allows, is a choice morsel for average\r\nreaders of newspapers. Everywhere it is the sexual abnormality,\r\nperversity, and even bestial vulgarity, that seems to attract the most\r\nattention. Books and magazines and theaters and preachers who extol the\r\nnormal and bright side of sex-life are not now extremely popular with\r\nthe masses of people. As a well-known magazine recently summarized the\r\npresent situation, \"it has struck sex o'clock in America.\" There is no\r\ndenying the fact that in recent years the popular interest in sex\r\nproblems has taken a dangerous turn. It is time for those who are\r\nactive in the sex-education movement to note the signs of the times,\r\nfor an effective educational scheme for young people must take into\r\naccount the present tendency towards a dangerous interest in literature\r\nrelating to sexual abnormality, especially immorality. All this\r\ntendency towards interest in the abnormal or irregular sexual problems\r\nmust cause not a little worry to those whose interest is primarily in\r\nsecuring widespread recognition of the advantages of normal and moral\r\nliving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need of interest in normal sex life.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps those who are seriously interested in sex-education may help\r\nstem the tide towards interest in sexual abnormality by using greater\r\ncare in the selection of literature, both for young people and for\r\ntheir elders. I recently met a superintendent of schools who had\r\ncarefully read certain large volumes on the medical, psychical, and\r\nsocial abnormalities of sex, and many books and pamphlets on the social\r\nevil. Altogether he had read more than five thousand pages on the\r\nimmoral and abnormal aspects of sex. He wanted to know where he might\r\nfind a book on the normal side of sex in its physiological,\r\npsychological, and ethical aspects. Unfortunately, there is no such\r\ntreatise by an author whose scientific standing equals that of several\r\nof those who have written extensively on the abnormal side; and\r\nprobably this is in part the reason why so many young men and women are\r\nnow molding their ideas of sexual life according to the patterns\r\ndescribed by the authors of works on social and sexual pathology. Not a\r\nmonth passes in which I am not astounded to find men and women who have\r\nplunged deeply into studies of sexual vice and pathology and who know\r\nless of the normal biology of sex than is contained in such books as\r\nW.S. Hall's \"Sexual Knowledge\" or the last chapter of Martin's \"Human\r\nBody, Advanced Course.\" This is indeed a strange situation, and we\r\nmight compare it with reading extensive works on insanity before\r\nlearning the elements of normal psychology. It is certainly a useless,\r\nif not a dangerous line of approach to the information concerning sex\r\nwhich intelligent people need. The leaders in the sex-education\r\nmovement will do well to promote the circulation of some brief and\r\nauthoritative statement of the chief facts relating to the problems of\r\nabnormal sexual life and then to discourage the popular circulation of\r\nthe extensive works which only certain physicians and social reformers\r\nneed. I know that there is some difference of opinion as to the effect\r\nof such literature. I know many prominent educators and physicians who\r\nwould keep the extensive works on the psychopathology of sex out of the\r\nhands of all general readers; but I also know a few who see no\r\npossibility of danger in widespread circulation of such books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limited knowledge of the abnormal.]\r\n\r\nLooking at all sides of the present situation, it is my personal\r\nconclusion that every one should learn first the scientific facts\r\nregarding normal processes connected with the sexual system; and then\r\nfor the general reader there should be only a limited amount of warning\r\nknowledge regarding the dangers of sexual abnormalities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSEX-INSTRUCTION FOR PRE-ADOLESCENT YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Periods of early life.]\r\n\r\nIn § 8 of the Report of the Committee of Three of the American\r\nFederation for Sex-hygiene, by Morrow and others, the life of the child\r\nwas divided into four periods, namely,--under six years, from six to\r\ntwelve, twelve to sixteen, sixteen to maturity. This division now seems\r\nto me to be too arbitrary, and I have come to believe that it is more\r\nhelpful to consider sex-instruction for three periods as follows:\r\npre-adolescence (ending at eleven to fourteen years); early adolescence\r\n(twelve to sixteen years for girls, thirteen to seventeen for boys);\r\nlater adolescence (sixteen to twenty-one for girls, eighteen to\r\ntwenty-five for boys).\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. _Elementary Instruction and Influence_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature-study.]\r\n\r\nThe life-histories of plants and animals as taught in the best\r\nnature-study[13] are important in forming attitude towards reproduction\r\nand giving a basis for simple and truthful answers to the child's\r\nquestions as to the origin of the individual human life. The\r\npublications listed in the last section of this book under the headings\r\n\"For Girls\" and \"For Boys\" will help parents and teachers.\r\n\r\nThere is need of little private hygienic instruction, but of much\r\nguidance away from harmful habits. This will be indicated in the next\r\nsection which considers masturbation as it concerns children of both\r\nsexes and all ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Protection.]\r\n\r\nThe protection of children from corrupting influences is an important\r\nwork of sex-education in pre-adolescent years. Probably the greatest\r\nsafety lies in parents giving simple facts regarding reproduction and\r\nin cultivating confidence so that any accidental contact of their\r\nchildren with vulgarity will be counteracted in advance. Many parents,\r\nespecially mothers, have found this possible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Girls' preparation for puberty.]\r\n\r\nIn the years between ten and twelve every child should learn from a\r\nparent or other adult confidant some general facts regarding their\r\napproaching puberty. This is especially important in the case of girls,\r\nfor many a girl has been physically and mentally injured because a\r\nprudish mother has procrastinated too long the giving of information\r\nregarding the first menstrual period. The facts in the first thirty\r\npages of W.S. Hall's \"Life Problems\" should be known by many girls of\r\neleven and by the great majority before thirteen. Some books for young\r\ngirls are defective in that they avoid reference to the coming\r\nchanges. I see no excuse for a sex-hygiene book for girls who are too\r\nyoung to be trusted with the simplest knowledge regarding menstruation.\r\nSuch children should be interested in nature studies and perhaps the\r\nelements of general hygiene, but certainly not in books with\r\ncuriosity-stimulating titles.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Special needs of boys.]\r\n\r\nSince boys entering puberty pass through no such sharply defined\r\nbeginning as girls do, the information they need in advance is not so\r\nspecific. At the same time, we must recognize that the average boy\r\nunder twelve years picks up more information regarding sexual life than\r\na girl does, and so the problem of teaching self-control comes earlier,\r\nalthough the average girl enters puberty a year or two before the boy.\r\nParents and teachers must recognize the fact that sexual tendencies\r\ncome to many boys several years before puberty, and masturbation and\r\neven premature sexual intercourse are possible problems with many boys\r\nlong before the twelfth year. The boy's early gathering of sexual\r\ninformation is not without advantage, for it becomes possible for\r\nparents and other adult confidants to explain many important truths as\r\nto the proper use of his sex organs and as to his conduct towards\r\ngirls. All this can be done with the average boy of eleven or twelve\r\nand with hundreds of even nine and ten without any fear of giving\r\ninformation that is startlingly new and without any danger of giving a\r\nnervous shock.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cautious teaching of girls.]\r\n\r\nIt is not so with average girls of equal ages, if we may accept the\r\nopinion of many women who are trained in science and medicine. Specific\r\ninformation as to the functional relationships of the two sexes is said\r\nby many educated women to have been absolutely new and startling to\r\nthem at twenty and twenty-five years. Evidently there is a special\r\nreason for gradual and cautious teaching of girls, and so it is\r\nprobably best, as many parents urge, that in pre-adolescent years the\r\ngirl's instruction in social-sexual lines be training in modest\r\ndeportment and a proper reserve towards boys. This ought to be\r\nsufficient for the girl's protection until gradually in adolescent\r\nyears she learns the whole story of life, probably several years later\r\nthan her boy friends whose natural leadership in sexual activity makes\r\ntheir early information desirable as a protection to both sexes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Children's friendships.]\r\n\r\nIn the pre-adolescent years parents and teachers should coöperate in\r\ndeveloping a spirit of group fellowship between boys and girls and at\r\nthe same time instill into the boys something of that chivalrous and\r\nprotective attitude of boys towards girls such as one finds in the\r\nfamilies of the highest culture. I emphatically mean \"group\r\nfellowship,\" for it is certainly undesirable to encourage in\r\npre-adolescents any tendency towards paired comradeship. It is\r\ncertainly best that boys and girls should have many good friends of\r\nboth sexes. The real truth back of the old adage \"two is company and\r\nthree is a crowd\" makes the \"crowd\" highly desirable for both\r\npre-adolescence and early adolescence, for in these years it is\r\nfriendship and not romantic love that will be most helpful in the later\r\nlife. As one step in this direction, all sensible adults should show\r\ntheir disfavor to the abominable habit of teasing small children\r\nconcerning their best friends of the other sex. Parents and teachers\r\nwill do some of the best work in the larger sex-education if they begin\r\nin pre-adolescent years to develop the social life of the children\r\nalong lines similar to those suggested above.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Summary.]\r\n\r\nSummarizing, it is evident that there is very little direct\r\nsex-instruction suitable for pre-adolescent years. So far as the\r\nchild's own life is concerned, it now seems clear that parents or other\r\nadult confidants must instruct individuals, or possibly small uniformly\r\nselected groups. Class instruction seems out of the question except for\r\nlife-history studies of animals and plants. On the whole, then, there\r\nis nothing radical or impossible in the proposition that there should\r\nbe a beginning of sex-education before the advent of adolescence.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. _Hygienic and Educational Treatment of Unhealthful Habits_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Problems of children.]\r\n\r\nAll adults should take a sane and scientific view of the sex problems\r\nthat are likely to come even to normal children. We must remember that\r\nthey are born with sexual mechanisms that may easily and automatically\r\nlead into harmful habits unless parents and teachers guide\r\nhygienically and mentally along the lines that are known to offer\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Masturbation.]\r\n\r\nConcerning habitual manipulation of the sexual organs of either sex,\r\nknown in medical literature as masturbation or self-abuse (often\r\nerroneously called \"onanism\"), there are certain facts that are\r\nimportant for the guidance of all parents and teachers. I discuss it in\r\nthis connection since the problem often arises in the later years of\r\nthe pre-adolescent period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Does not indicate degeneracy.]\r\n\r\nIt is absurd to suppose that the tendency towards the habit means\r\ndegeneracy or innate viciousness of children. Young horses, dogs,\r\nmonkeys, and other animals sometimes form a similar habit, the stimulus\r\nbeing some irritation of the sexual organs. Hence, it is not at all\r\nunnatural when children attempt to relieve their irritated organs by\r\nfriction, and then it is inevitable that the sensitive nerve endings\r\nwill give sensations that are more or less pleasurable and satisfying,\r\ndepending upon the sex, age, and emotional peculiarity of the\r\nindividual child. This fact suggests to parents and teachers the\r\nmethods of prophylaxis; namely, avoid (1) irritation of sexual organs\r\nand (2) opportunity for manipulation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Irritation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Circumcision.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to irritation, the first sign of such disturbance may\r\nappear in babyhood. In the case of boys, whose structure renders them\r\nvastly more liable than girls to external irritation, the family\r\nphysician should make sure during infancy whether circumcision or a\r\nstretching of the prepuce (foreskin) may be desirable. According to Dr.\r\nEmmet Holt, the eminent pediatrician, about one male baby in four or\r\nfive is born with an elongated or tight prepuce that needs surgical\r\nattention. A corresponding abnormality of the clitoris is sometimes\r\nfound in baby girls. Some radical surgeons advocate universal\r\ncircumcision of boys because they believe that it reduces local\r\nirritation, favors cleanliness, tends to prevent masturbation, and\r\nreduces susceptibility to the venereal diseases. There is certainly\r\nsome truth in these claims; but some conservative surgeons point out\r\nthat for the great majority of boys all these advantages may be\r\nobtained by reasonable attention to hygienic habits, that orthodox\r\nJewish and other circumcised boys are by no means free from harmful\r\nhabits, that some boys are more irritable after circumcision, that\r\npreputial stretching is often a good substitute for circumcision, and\r\nthat the taunts of other boys often make circumcised boys too conscious\r\nof their own mutilation. A scientific doctor who has no special\r\nfinancial interest in the increase of surgical operations and who\r\ncarefully reviews both the radical and conservative literature relating\r\nto circumcision, will not hasten to submit boys to this operation until\r\nit is certain that their sexual organs happen to have congenital\r\ndeformity that only radical surgical treatment can correct.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hygienic rules.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to making sure that uncleanliness or structural abnormality\r\nare not responsible for irritation of sex organs, there are some\r\nspecial hygienic rules useful for parents and teachers who have charge\r\nof children. Most important is avoidance of habit formation. Clothing\r\nshould be well adjusted to avoid pressure and friction of the sexual\r\norgans, and so constructed (especially night clothing) that it is not\r\nconvenient for the hands to reach the organs. Normal boys require\r\npockets, but they should open at the waist-band and not at the side of\r\nthe hips. The reason for these suggestions is evident. When we recall\r\nthat little children naturally tend to explore themselves, such as by\r\nputting fingers into the mouth, feeling their toes, inserting foreign\r\nobjects into nose and ears, and when we also recall how quickly a child\r\nmay learn the habit of sucking its thumb, we must realize the\r\nimportance of guarding the child from extending such activities to its\r\nsexual organs, which, because they possess the most sensitive nerve\r\nendings in the body, are most liable to lead to habitual manipulation.\r\nIn the light of such facts, it is nonsense to assume, as so many good\r\nmothers have done, that only innately vicious children learn\r\nmasturbation. The truth is that in the case of most children under\r\ntwelve this habit has an origin no more vicious than such habits as\r\nthumb-sucking; and in all cases of habits, parents and others\r\nresponsible for the children should be given the blame.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other suggestions for parents.]\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions in addition to those above are likely to help\r\nparents do much towards avoiding or solving the early sex problems of\r\ntheir children. These facts apply also to later years.\r\n\r\nHave children sleep on a hard mattress. The old-time feather bed was\r\ndangerous. There should be light-weight covers, and the room cool.\r\nChildren should sleep on either side, _rarely_ in the unnatural back\r\nposition. Aim to have regular sleeping hours; but do not send children\r\nto bed unsupervised when they are excited and not tired enough for\r\nimmediate sleep. Have them arise as soon as wide awake in the morning.\r\nNever punish children by sending them to bed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dangers of privacy.]\r\n\r\nDo not leave children to their own devices; they may naturally fall\r\ninto dangerous play. Privacy is often demanded by the moods of adults,\r\nbut it is dangerous for children. A certain camp for boys has the\r\ncommendable rule that the boys have no privacy during the entire\r\nsummer. Many educators and physicians condemn private bedrooms or\r\ncubicles in schools for boys.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Athletics.]\r\n\r\nA strenuous life of physical and mental activity is the best solution\r\nof personal control of sexual instincts. Reasonable athletics and study\r\nmake an ideal combination for both boys and girls. And yet we must not\r\ntrust absolutely to athletics or other physical work, for there are\r\ncertainly many individuals whose sexual desires are not controlled by\r\nmuscular exercise. Much of the formal athletic training may have no\r\nmore influence on sexual control than dogmatic creeds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Drugs.]\r\n\r\nStrong condiments and alcoholic drinks are known to be sexual excitants\r\nfor many people, and for this and other hygienic reasons should be\r\nforbidden to children. There is a widespread, but still undemonstrated\r\nopinion that tea, coffee, tobacco, and strong condiments have an\r\nexciting effect. However, there is plenty of scientific authority,\r\nbased on other hygienic grounds, for avoiding these at least during the\r\nyears of growth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constipation.]\r\n\r\nConstipation is likely to cause sexual irritation, and hence this is an\r\nadditional reason for submitting children to competent doctors for\r\ntreatment of this disturbance which so seriously affects general\r\nhealth, especially by auto-intoxication.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bathing.]\r\n\r\nCool bathing in the morning, especially of the sexual organs, is\r\nhygienic, except for girls during the monthly periods (including two\r\ndays before the expected menstrual onset). For various reasons, bathing\r\nin very warm water should be very limited, and then only for cleansing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Form of instruction.]\r\n\r\nIn hygienic instructions to children, avoid giving them any ideas\r\nconcerning the supposed prevalence of the habit of masturbation. There\r\nis a dangerous tendency to follow the crowd. Also, the habit should\r\nnever be described to children except as \"unnecessary handling of the\r\nsex organs.\" It is dangerous to suggest to children, as certain books\r\ndo, that there is any pleasurable sensation resulting from manual\r\nmanipulation of the organs, for the force of suggestion or curiosity\r\nhas led some children to experiment with themselves until they formed\r\nthe habit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Symptoms.]\r\n\r\nThere are no absolutely certain signs or symptoms, and those suggested\r\nby certain authors, especially by quack doctors, make young people and\r\neven parents and teachers judge some individuals in an unfortunate way.\r\nEspecially should parents and teachers remember that there is\r\nabsolutely no scientific basis for supposing that great diffidence,\r\nindigestion, pimples on the face, boys' lack of interest in girls, and\r\nnumerous other popular \"signs,\" are indications of the masturbation\r\nhabit. Like the symptoms in patent-medicine advertising, the above\r\n\"signs\" are so general that they are sure to fit some cases.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Insanity.]\r\n\r\nDo not tell children the ancient falsehood that insanity will surely\r\nresult from handling the sexual organs. It is true that masturbation is\r\na common habit of certain types of insane people and of some neurotics;\r\nbut it is probable that the habit is more often one of several factors\r\nrather than the direct cause of the nervous breakdown. However, it is\r\nscientific to say that the habit may weaken the nervous system and\r\nindirectly affect general health, especially in pre-adolescent and\r\nearly adolescent years. Probably the greatest nervous damage comes\r\nbecause there is often greater excess than is possible in natural\r\nsexual relations; the strain of all sexual excess is more in loss of\r\nnervous energy than of secretions. The safest advice one can give\r\nchildren is that the doctors agree that unnecessary touching of sexual\r\norgans has interfered with the health of many children and that those\r\nwho avoid this are most likely to grow up strong in body and mind. This\r\nis the truth and practically the whole of the known truth that might\r\nhave influence with young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mental habit.]\r\n\r\nMental masturbation or \"day dreaming\" concerning sexual functions is\r\nprobably more harmful than mechanical manipulation. It is believed to\r\nbe more common in young women than in men. However, there is little\r\nreliable evidence as to the prevalence of the habit. As an educational\r\nproblem, there is nothing to be done beyond informing all adolescent\r\nyoung people that allowing their minds to dwell on sexual affairs may\r\ninterfere with nervous health, scholarship, and future efficiency in\r\nlife. Hard mental and physical work and strenuous play as a daily\r\nroutine will avoid or solve most such difficulties of young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not hopeless.]\r\n\r\nIn all dealing with this problem of young people, we must beware of\r\noveremphasis or exaggeration. Parents and teachers should do all\r\npossible to prevent and cure the habit; but there is still hope for\r\nmost young people who, in spite of warning, occasionally lapse into\r\ntheir old habits. Both men and women of this type have led their\r\nclasses through college and won success afterwards. Probably they would\r\nhave done still better if entirely free from the habit. On the other\r\nhand, men and women of neurotic inheritance combined with the habit\r\nhave suffered nervous collapse during college years; and it is\r\nscientific to assume that the additional nervous strain produced by\r\nmasturbation was a contributing factor. Evidently, we dare make no\r\ndefinite prophecy as to what will happen to one who in early life forms\r\nthe habit of masturbation. There is no excuse for excessive alarm in\r\nany ordinary case; but, as we have seen, there are good reasons why\r\nparents and teachers should calmly and yet firmly help young people\r\navoid unnatural sexual activity.\r\n\r\nTo those who must consider the problem of masturbation in boarding\r\nschools, I recommend Hime's \"Schoolboys' Special Immorality.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[13] See books on nature-study, _e.g._, Holtz's \"Nature-Study,\"\r\nHodge's \"Nature-Study and Life,\" Comstock's \"Handbook of\r\nNature-Study.\" Morley's \"Renewal of Life,\" March's \"Towards Racial\r\nHealth,\" and Hall's \"The Doctor's Daughter\" suggest the main lines of\r\nthe nature-study approach to sex-education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nSEX-INSTRUCTION FOR EARLY ADOLESCENT YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. _The Biological Foundations_\r\n\r\nIn discussing instruction for the pre-adolescent years I have stressed\r\nbiological nature-study as important for the purpose of giving general\r\nknowledge of how new living things come into the world. This will\r\ndevelop a good attitude concerning the origin of the individual human\r\nlife. In this lecture I wish to direct attention to the scientific\r\nfacts which are foundations for the sexual knowledge that is important\r\nfor other phases of sex-instruction during early or late adolescence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Biological foundations.]\r\n\r\nI believe that the best introduction to advanced sex-instruction is\r\nthrough biological ideas which may be presented in popular lectures and\r\nbooks; but, of course, will be best taught in courses of biological\r\nscience. My own view as to the selection of materials for such\r\nbiological studies is expressed in the sections on reproduction\r\nconnected with the account of each animal or plant type in the \"Applied\r\nBiology\" and in the last chapter of the \"Introduction to Biology.\"[14]\r\nIn these books the study of life-histories of plants and animals leads\r\nup through vertebrates to mammals, and there are a few remarks\r\nsuggesting that human development is like the mammals.[15] At this\r\npoint these books should be supplemented by a brief survey of the\r\nessential structure, physiology, and embryology of human reproduction.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mixed classes.]\r\n\r\nBiological studies of human reproduction should not be coeducational in\r\nhigh schools or the early years of college. Mature college students who\r\nhave passed through extensive biological studies, may, without apparent\r\nembarrassment, study human embryology in mixed classes; but after\r\nexperience with many such groups I have begun to think that separate\r\nclasses are desirable if the course is made to include all the\r\nimportant facts that college graduates should know concerning human\r\nreproduction. At any rate, there should be special lessons or reading\r\ndealing with detailed information that directly concerns one sex only.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impersonal approach of biology.]\r\n\r\nI certainly do not believe in completely revamping biological science\r\nfor the purposes of sex-education. It is better not to \"spoil\" a course\r\nby overemphasis on sex, for much of the value of biology as a basis for\r\nsex-education is the fact that sex appears gradually and naturally and\r\nfar away from human relations. This impersonal approach will be lost if\r\nthe course in biology seems to revolve around sex-education, for that\r\nwill make sex too prominent.\r\n\r\nIt is still debatable as to how much should be taught in high schools\r\nor in public lectures concerning the biological facts of human\r\nreproduction. I think that I can make my own views clearer if I discuss\r\nthis first for boys, then for girls.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 28. _Scientific Facts for Boys_\r\n\r\nFirst, it is generally agreed that boys of high-school age may profit\r\nby learning their own sexual structure by means of diagrams such as the\r\none in Hall's \"Sexual Hygiene.\" There is no harm, and also no gain, in\r\nminute description, especially histological.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scientific names.]\r\n\r\nThe chief technical names of the parts of the male organs--testicle\r\n(spermary or testes), sperm duct (vas deferens), scrotum, prostate,\r\nseminal vesicles, penis, glans, prepuce (foreskin), urethra--should be\r\ntaught; and the scientific dignity of these words as substitutes for\r\nvulgar words should be emphasized. In dealing with boys and young men I\r\nhave noticed that these and other scientific words have a great\r\ninfluence on their attitude. The scientific names of the sex organs\r\nshould be made part of popular vocabulary for the reason that there are\r\nno established common names corresponding to lungs, liver, stomach,\r\narm, leg, brain, and so on for all prominent organs except the sexual.\r\nThese have been left without authoritative names except in scientific\r\nlanguage, and as a result dozens of ordinary words have been vulgarly\r\napplied and unprintable ones invented by uneducated people. Such usage\r\nof vulgar terminology is widespread, especially among men and boys. An\r\neditor of schoolbooks recently called my attention to the necessity of\r\nchanging some ordinary words in certain books because in some\r\nlocalities the boys applied the words to sexual organs. Even the little\r\nwords \"nuts,\" \"stones,\" \"balls\" accompanied by the adjective \"two\" mean\r\ntesticles in the widespread vulgar language; and a physician told me\r\nthat a college graduate used one of these words the other day when\r\nseeking medical advice concerning her baby. Here is an intolerable\r\nsituation that must be improved by establishing in popular usage the\r\ndignified scientific words for the chief sexual organs. We must begin\r\nto do so by teaching the words frankly to boys of adolescent years, and\r\nby persuading parents to teach their children correctly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-physiology.]\r\n\r\nHaving learned the structure and names of their sexual organs, boys may\r\neasily understand the function of each part if explained in simple\r\nlanguage. Ten or twenty minutes ought to be enough time for stating the\r\nimportant facts. One printed page could state them clearly. Here is the\r\ntime for personal hygienic advice, especially such topics as: rules for\r\nself-control; harmful habits (see discussion of masturbation in § 26);\r\nsexual activity not necessary for health; occasional nocturnal\r\nemissions not pathological.[16]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Female organs.]\r\n\r\nI believe it is well for boys of adolescent years to know a few leading\r\nfacts regarding female structure and function, but such knowledge is\r\nbest learned from oral description by a well-balanced teacher. Diagrams\r\nand (in some schools) a demonstrated dissection of a cat or other\r\nanimal will be helpful. The meaning of the ovaries as sources of the\r\negg-cells and of the uterus as the place for development of the\r\nfertilized egg-cell should be explained in a serious way that will help\r\nboys get some fundamental ideas as to what motherhood means Boys,\r\nmoreover, should be informed concerning the existence of the periodic\r\ndisturbance in the other sex, for unless they know they are sure at\r\ntimes to misunderstand their sisters and other girls. Professor W.S.\r\nHall has stated the essential information in \"Chums\" (for boys twelve\r\nto sixteen), but his comparison of periodicity in the two sexes is not\r\nstrictly accurate, for there are not in men any sexual cycles that are\r\nstrictly comparable with the menstrual cycles of women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: No pictures.]\r\n\r\nIt is probably best, as urged by several writers, that the life-like\r\nillustrations, some of them photographic, in books of human anatomy be\r\nkept away from boys of early adolescent age. Diagrams can be made to\r\nexplain all that is necessary, and without the danger of stimulation\r\nthat might come from the illustrated medical books.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Embryology.]\r\n\r\nThe embryological facts of human biology are very impressive to boys\r\nand young men who know little of science. I believe that no other line\r\nof scientific facts is so likely to claim a serious and respectful\r\nattitude. The ideal way for giving a popular glimpse at human\r\ndevelopment is with a small series of lantern slides or photographs\r\nfrom embryological works. Unfortunately, there is no available popular\r\ntreatment of the main facts of human development, but teachers trained\r\nin biology can easily glean the facts for the preparation of a short\r\nlecture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social diseases.]\r\n\r\nSince the venereal diseases are due to micro-organisms, I believe that\r\nthey should be introduced in connection with the study of bacteria and\r\nother germs, either in school courses or in popular lectures. Such\r\ninstruction should be very brief.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29. _Scientific Facts for Girls_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Girls more innocent.]\r\n\r\nI discussed first the problem of selecting scientific facts for boys\r\nbecause there is little dispute as to the advisability of giving them\r\nas much scientific information as may possibly replace the vulgar\r\nknowledge that the average boy is likely to possess. I know that there\r\nare a few men and many women who will disagree with this because they\r\nbelieve in the absolute ignorance of their boys; but I doubt whether\r\none healthy adolescent boy in a hundred belongs in the \"innocent\"\r\nclass. So we need not worry much concerning any supposed danger of\r\ntreating facts too frankly, provided that they are given a dignified,\r\nscientific setting. In the case of numerous adolescent girls there is\r\ncertainly dense ignorance, and so there must be more difficulty in\r\ngetting approval of parents and teachers concerning facts proposed for\r\ngirls. Often when talking with groups of parents I have heard them say\r\nthat they would like to have their boys learn the scientific truth\r\nregarding certain facts, but they feel that it would be too startling\r\nand unnecessary for their daughters. Such is the widespread feeling\r\nwhich must be seriously considered in all planning of advanced\r\nsex-instruction for girls. No doubt there will be much honest\r\ndisagreement with the suggestions here offered.\r\n\r\nThe biological introduction based on plants and animals should be the\r\nsame as for boys (§ 27).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Structure and names.]\r\n\r\nAn adolescent girl of fourteen to sixteen should know the general plan\r\nof her own sexual structure. She should know the scientific names of\r\nher organs, not because there are many vulgar names as in the case of\r\nboys, but because dignified names help attitude. Ovaries, uterus\r\n(womb), vagina, Fallopian tubes, and vulva will be sufficient. Detailed\r\ndescription of the external organs (vulva) might arouse curiosity that\r\nleads to exploration and irritation, and hence many women physicians\r\nthink that a girl under sixteen or possibly eighteen needs only the\r\nname vulva for the external parts surrounding the entrance to the\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An ancient belief.]\r\n\r\nSome books for girls perpetuate the ancient but absurd emphasis on the\r\nvirginal significance of the hymen; and a recent book from a prominent\r\npublisher goes so far as to try to frighten girls into remaining chaste\r\nby stating that a physician could discover if they have been unchaste.\r\nThis is far from being always true, for the structure may be\r\ncongenitally absent, may sometimes remain after sexual union, or may be\r\naccidentally destroyed in childhood; and reliable physicians have\r\nstated that proving unchastity by the hymen is by no means easy. Hence,\r\nthe less said about the ancient belief, the better for young women. The\r\ntruth is that the hymen is a worse-than-useless relic of embryological\r\ndevelopment, and it is neither an indicator nor a dictator of morality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physiology of women.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the physiology of the female organs, the following\r\ntopics should be considered: The meaning of puberty as the beginning of\r\na long fertile period of about thirty years; the nature of menstruation\r\nas a periodical process preparing the lining of the uterus for\r\nreception and attachment of an embryo if a sperm-cell meets a liberated\r\negg-cell near an ovary, and not as a season of illness invented by the\r\npowers of darkness; the possibility of fertilization following sexual\r\nrelations at any time during the fertile life of a woman; the essential\r\nfacts of sexual relation as a method of depositing sperm-cells so that\r\nthey can swim on the way to meet an egg-cell; and the nature of the\r\nclose blood relationship of mother and embryo. These are physiological\r\ntopics which many parents would like to have taught to their daughters\r\nof fourteen to eighteen by some careful woman or by some good book.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social ills.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the social diseases and the social evil, I have long\r\nsympathized with the conservatives who hold that extremely limited\r\nknowledge is sufficient for the average girl under eighteen or twenty.\r\nNo doubt that many working girls in cities need more protective\r\nknowledge than do school girls of the same age. Hall's \"Life Problems\"\r\nseems to me to give the important facts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habits.]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of boys of adolescent years, there should be enough\r\nteaching to warn against harmful habits. Such knowledge may possibly be\r\nof personal application to a few girls and it will be of use to many\r\ngirls who will later as mothers or teachers have the care of small\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Knowledge concerning men.]\r\n\r\nI find that many thoughtful mothers and women physicians think that\r\ngirls in late adolescent years should learn from some reliable source\r\nthe most general facts regarding male structure and function. Here\r\nagain the strong argument is that the majority will have the care of\r\nsmall children. Such instruction has often been given as part of\r\ncourses in biology and physiology and also in special lectures. It is\r\ncertain that some parents will favor such instruction, and others will\r\nregard it as indecent to suggest that girls should have any such\r\nknowledge. There will always be some parents who will let their\r\ndaughters face life-problems blindly.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mothercraft.]\r\n\r\nSometime in adolescent years girls should learn the scientific facts\r\nregarding mothercraft or the care of small children. This phase of the\r\nsex-education is rapidly attracting attention from those who are\r\ninterested in practical arts education, and before many years pass it\r\nwill probably be treated adequately in connection with household arts\r\nin schools and colleges. I have already referred to household arts in\r\ngeneral as making a decided contribution to the larger sex-education\r\nwhich works for harmonious adjustment of the sexes in the home.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Both books by M.A. and Anna N. Bigelow.\r\n\r\n[15] Sets of drawings and lantern slides for the biological\r\nintroduction to sex may be obtained from the American Social Hygiene\r\nAssociation, 105 W. 40th St., New York City.\r\n\r\n[16] The instructor of young men should not allow confusion to arise\r\nfrom the recent contention of some medical men that emissions are\r\nabnormal or unnatural because they are not known to occur in animals.\r\nCertain it is that they are adaptations to changes caused by enforced\r\nsexual restraint after the seminal secretions begin with puberty. Such\r\nrestraint is, of course, abnormal or unnatural if we compare with\r\nanimals; but many of our acts are unnatural and not necessarily\r\nunhealthful. For instance, the sedentary life of the student or\r\nprofessional worker is abnormal or unnatural, but it need not be\r\nunhealthful, if hygienic adaptations are made. Likewise, seminal\r\nemissions are unnatural for primitive men or animals without sexual\r\nrestraint, but this does not mean that they are unhealthful for\r\nself-controlled men. Here, as in many other cases, comparison with\r\nanimals is misleading and does not teach us useful facts concerning\r\nhuman sexual functioning. The truth is that physicians have no\r\nevidence of harm from emissions that are not caused by voluntary\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SEX-INSTRUCTION FOR ADOLESCENT BOYS AND YOUNG MEN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Methods and teachers.]\r\n\r\nIn this lecture I shall discuss a number of problems in the relations\r\nof men to women which ought somehow to be made clear to boys who are in\r\ntransition to manhood. I can do little more than point out the lines\r\nalong which it is desirable that young men should be informed and\r\ninfluenced; for I confess that I do not know any guaranteed pedagogical\r\nmethod for teaching along these lines. So far as I can now see, it\r\nseems to me that a good beginning would consist in getting the best\r\nideas before young men by lectures, books, and personal conversations.\r\nHere more than in any other phase of sex-education the influence of\r\npersonality is of great importance. Many an ordinary teacher or\r\nlecturer may well present the cold facts of biological science that\r\nhelp interpret sex, but one who does not by his personal qualities\r\ncommand the entire confidence of his hearers is worse than useless in\r\npresenting to young men such problems as those outlined in this lecture\r\nunder the following subheadings: Developing young men's attitude\r\ntowards womanhood; developing ideals of love and marriage; reasons for\r\npre-marital continence; essential knowledge concerning prostitution;\r\nneed of more refinement in men; dancing as a sex problem for men; dress\r\nas a sexual appeal; the problem of self-control; the mental side of a\r\nyoung man's sex life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30. _Developing Attitude towards Womanhood_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of ideals.]\r\n\r\nMany there are among the believers in the larger sex-education who feel\r\nsure that a young man's greatest safety lies in having high ideals of\r\nwomanhood. I have known a number of men who passed unscathed through\r\nthe storm and stress of early manhood because each of them could say,\r\nas Tennyson makes the lover confess to Princess Ida, \"from earlier than\r\nI know, immersed in rich foreshadowings of the world, I loved the\r\nwoman.\" Some of these men learned to love \"the woman\" in the abstract,\r\nin the dream world, perhaps as the \"brushwood girl\" of Kipling. Others\r\nfirst loved \"the woman\" through boyhood sweethearts. Still others came\r\nto love her through mothers who inspired them with reverence for\r\nwomanhood and motherhood.\r\n\r\n    ...\"Happy he\r\n    With such a mother! faith in womankind\r\n      Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high comes easy\r\n        to him.\"\r\n                                                    (Tennyson)\r\n\r\nBut it matters little for the future purity of the boy on the threshold\r\nof manhood whether he has learned to love \"the woman\" in the dreamland\r\nof youth or in the very real world of life. It is simply a question of\r\nthe intensity of the devotion and of the loftiness of the ideals which\r\nShe has aroused within him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Who may influence boys.]\r\n\r\nNow, we of the older generation, who as parents and teachers are\r\nlargely the makers of the boy's view of life, may play a very important\r\npart in developing in him a love for \"the woman,\" a reverence for\r\nwomanhood. The greatest opportunity falls to the lot of that mother\r\nwhose natural gifts and education adapt her for impressing her son\r\nprofoundly with appreciation of womanhood. The next greatest\r\nopportunity comes to the woman who as an instructor in school, church,\r\nor other institution comes into intimate relations that sometimes give\r\nthe teacher greater influence than the mother is able or willing to\r\nexert. Finally, we must not discount the value of men's coöperation in\r\nthis problem, for many a boy's attitude towards women is largely the\r\nreflection of what he has seen in his father and in other men,\r\nparticularly in his teachers both secular and religious.\r\n\r\nNow, while the direct influence of personality is most important in\r\nthis problem of developing a young man's attitude towards women,\r\norganized educational effort should not be neglected. It is important\r\nthat both men and women help by encouraging young men to read good\r\nliterature that unobtrusively tends to introduce them to the best in\r\nwomanhood (see § 23); and by discussing with them, as opportunity\r\noffers, the higher ideals of the relationships between men and women.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31. _Developing Ideals of Love and Marriage_\r\n\r\nClosely associated with high ideals of womanhood is necessarily a pure\r\nunderstanding of love, even in its physical basis. While preparing this\r\nlecture I discovered that James Oliphant (in the _International Journal\r\nof Ethics_, Vol. 9, pp. 288-289, 1898) has well expressed some of the\r\nviews that in a more or less unformulated shape have been in my mind\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ideals of love in art.]\r\n\r\n    \"If the true preparation for love and marriage is, as I hold it to\r\n    be, to learn to associate physical passion with the higher\r\n    emotions developed by social sympathy--with a single-hearted\r\n    devotion that demands courage, and self-sacrifice and considerate\r\n    forethought and tenderness; if we wish to bind all these qualities\r\n    together in the imagination of the young and clothe the conception\r\n    with every attribute of beauty that fancy can devise, how can we\r\n    forego the precious opportunities that lie to our hand in the\r\n    persuasive witchery of art? The power that may be exercised in the\r\n    formation of character by the presentment of ideal types is as yet\r\n    very imperfectly utilized. Love is _par excellence_ the theme of\r\n    the artist, and young people will soon find this out for\r\n    themselves; but there is a wide difference in the degrees of\r\n    idealization, and, while we concern ourselves to exclude the\r\n    grosser forms, we neglect the only effective means of\r\n    accomplishing this, namely, the persistent presentation of the\r\n    sentiment in its noblest examples. It is the prevalent idea that\r\n    the longer we can keep all notions of love, even in its romantic\r\n    guise, out of children's heads, the better it will be for them.\r\n    Surely it would be a wiser policy to fill their minds as soon as\r\n    they are able to receive them, with the creations of art in which\r\n    love is represented in its sublimest aspects. The youth who is\r\n    familiar with the love-stories of Shakespeare, and George Eliot,\r\n    and Meredith, will suffer little harm from the gilded sensualism\r\n    of the Restoration drama. Let us hasten to implant the images of\r\n    beauty that will keep the soul sweet and wholesome, and free from\r\n    the taint of any later influences, however sordid these may be.\"\r\n\r\nIn the lecture on marriage as offering one of the problems for the\r\nlarger sex-education (§ 12) and in the reference to general literature\r\nin § 23, I have called attention to literature which will be suggestive\r\nand useful to those who are considering the young man's attitude\r\ntowards love and marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32. _Reasons for Pre-marital Continence of Men_\r\n\r\nRecognizing the fact that moral considerations fail to reach many\r\npeople, the following points should be emphasized in trying to show\r\nyoung men practical reasons why they should avoid pre-marital sexual\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continence and health.]\r\n\r\n(1) Young men ought to know that many eminent physicians and\r\nphysiologists agree that it has not been proved that continence injures\r\nthe health of men who make an effort to avoid sexual temptations.\r\nPhysicians of the highest standing never advise extra-marital or\r\nimmoral relations, for they are far more likely to injure health than\r\nto improve it, and they surely injure character and reputation. On\r\nthis question of continence young men should read such pamphlets as\r\n\"Sexual Necessity\" by Howell and Keyes; \"The Young Man's Problem\" and\r\n\"Health and Hygiene of Sex\" by Morrow; \"The Physician's Answer\" and\r\n\"The Rational Sex Life for Men\" by Exner.[17] Also, see pp. 183-190 in\r\nGeddes and Thomson's \"Sex.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Exner's \"Physician's Answer\" is based on the following declaration\r\nwhich was signed by about three hundred of the foremost physicians of\r\nAmerica:\r\n\r\n    \"In view of the individual and social dangers which spring from\r\n    the widespread belief that continence may be detrimental to\r\n    health, and of the fact that municipal toleration of prostitution\r\n    is sometimes defended on the ground that sexual indulgence is\r\n    necessary, we, the undersigned, members of the medical profession,\r\n    testify to our belief that continence has not been shown to be\r\n    detrimental to health or virility; that there is no evidence of\r\n    its being inconsistent with the highest physical, mental, and\r\n    moral efficiency; and that it offers the only sure reliance for\r\n    sexual health outside of marriage.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Psychical results of incontinence.]\r\n\r\n(2) It ought to be significant to young men that many men who are now\r\nin the thirties or forties look back upon their youthful errors with\r\nprofound regret. Many such men testify that unforgettable immoral\r\nexperiences keep them from reaching the heights of love with their\r\nwives. One of my friends, a well-known physician, recently met in his\r\noffice within two or three months seven men of high standing who are\r\nnow happily married, but who feel that conjugal life is short of its\r\nfull æsthetic possibilities because of the ever-present remembrance of\r\nearly sexual mistakes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Physical results.]\r\n\r\n(3) While the above refers to the psychical effect of youthful errors,\r\nyoung men should learn that there is also a physical side to the same\r\nproblem. Eminent physicians assert that many men have completely and\r\npermanently destroyed their sexual functions by extensive dissipations,\r\neither by masturbation or by natural relations; and that very many more\r\nhave injured themselves so that perfection of the physical basis of\r\nlove and marriage is impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Possible diseases.]\r\n\r\n(4) The probability of venereal infection by pre-marital relations and\r\nthe danger of transmission to innocent wives and children should be\r\npresented to all young men as a strong ethical appeal for continence\r\n(see § 7).\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Purity for purity.]\r\n\r\n(5) The \"fair play\" or \"square deal\" appeal to young men should be\r\nbased on the fact that most for young men who are unchaste demand\r\npurity of the girls they claim as sisters, friends, or sweethearts; and\r\nyet they help drag down other women. An honorable man should be willing\r\nto play fairly and give purity for purity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Responsibility.]\r\n\r\n(6) The grave responsibility of young men whose unchastity is connected\r\nwith illegitimacy or with the organized social evil should be made a\r\nstrong point in appeals for pre-marital abstinence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sexuality and affection.]\r\n\r\n(7) Young men should be impressed with the idea that their sexual\r\nfunctions should be held sacred to affection; in other words, that\r\nsexual union is moral only as love interchange. In so far as young men\r\nmay be led to this interpretation of the relation of sexuality to the\r\nbest conceptions of life, there will be no danger of prostitution and\r\nthere will be a guarantee of marriages that give completeness to\r\naffection. The men who are safeguarded against unchastity are those who\r\nhave learned to think of love and marriage and sexual functioning as\r\ninterdependent and coincident elements in the great drama of life and\r\nwho feel the impossibility of their personal interest in marriage\r\nwithout love or in sexual union except as expression of deep affection.\r\nSuch men are by no means as rare as the sensational reports of the\r\nsocial evil lead many people to believe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some men beyond appeal.]\r\n\r\nI realize that all these seven reasons for continence will fail with\r\nthat large group of young men who have persuaded themselves that they\r\nwill never marry and thus they shake off all responsibility such as\r\nappeals to the man who looks forward to love that culminates in\r\nmarriage. No one has yet suggested any line of appeal to the men who\r\nare physically or psychically or morally so abnormal that they have no\r\ninterest in the possibility of marriage; but fortunately such\r\nindividuals constitute an insignificant minority.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33. _Essential Knowledge Concerning Prostitution_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Safeguarding boys.]\r\n\r\n(1) The adolescent boy should be safeguarded by the knowledge that in\r\nevery city and in most towns there are women who for financial gain are\r\nconstantly seeking to entice young men into immoral sexual relations;\r\nand that many unwary men are involuntarily entrapped, especially when\r\ninfluenced by alcohol.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prostitution a business.]\r\n\r\n(2) The young man should know that the selling of woman's virtue is an\r\norganized business known as \"prostitution\" or \"the social evil,\" words\r\nwhich stand for indescribable degradation and degeneracy that no beast\r\ncould possibly imitate. Moreover, the young man should be informed that\r\nall immorality is not prostitution, but that most of the immoral\r\nrelations of men are purchased directly or indirectly by money or its\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some causes of prostitution.]\r\n\r\n(3) The young man should know that the great majority of prostitutes do\r\nnot willingly undertake the shameful business of selling their virtue.\r\nHe should know that the majority have gone downward for such reasons as\r\nfollows: Many a woman has been betrayed by some detestable man who\r\npretended to love her. Poverty has forced many other women to the\r\nfirst downward step. Many are easy victims because they belong to the\r\nfeeble-minded class. Others have been driven into immoral life by\r\nparents and even husbands. Still others have been drugged, and raped\r\nwhile insensible. A limited number have begun prostitution as \"white\r\nslaves\" kept as prisoners until all hope of a better life has vanished.\r\nA few have deliberately begun to accept the attentions of lewd men in\r\norder to get money for luxurious dress and finery. And relatively very\r\nfew have started downward because of sexual passion such as commonly\r\ninfluences men. In short, every young man should be informed that most\r\nwomen living by prostitution have begun innocently or unwillingly; but\r\nhaving made one false step, society has shunned them, even near\r\nrelatives have cast them off, and a career of prostitution has appeared\r\nthe only way of making a living, vulgar and unspeakably sordid though\r\nit be. It is evident that the responsibility for prostitution rests\r\nalmost entirely upon men. Unfortunately, society does not recognize\r\nthis fact and has no way of dealing legally with both men and women\r\nfound associated in houses of prostitution. At present the women\r\narrested for prostitution are treated as criminals, while their male\r\nassociates in vice are allowed to depart as if they were respectable\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Appeal to men.]\r\n\r\nTell young men these facts as to why women become prostitutes. Help\r\nthem to realize that most of these women are pitiful victims of man's\r\nworse than brutal sexual passions. Then add the astounding fact that\r\nvery many of the women of the underworld have short lives, their health\r\nbeing undermined rapidly by dissipation, by alcohol used to bury their\r\nshame or to stimulate their flagging energies, and by the two loathsome\r\ndiseases, gonorrhea and syphilis, which relatively few prostitutes\r\nescape--tell young men such facts which eminent physicians and\r\nsociologists have often verified, and there are good chances of\r\nstriking sympathetic notes in their young manhood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger of social disease.]\r\n\r\n(4) And there is one other line of facts concerning prostitution that\r\nthe developing young man should know well, namely, that every\r\nprostitute is likely at any time to be infected with the social\r\ndiseases, and that no ordinary medical examination can prove that she\r\nwill not transmit these awful diseases to men who consort with her. In\r\nfact, within an hour after most careful medical examination she may\r\nbecome infected by some diseased man, and then she is capable of\r\ninoculating other men. Such facts, for which the greatest of special\r\nphysicians vouch, will eradicate from the young man's mind the\r\nwidespread notions that prostitutes are safe if they carry a\r\nphysician's certificate, or one of the official cards given in some\r\nEuropean cities. Many a young man of sixteen to twenty has not heard\r\nthat prostitutes as a class are universally dangerous as distributors\r\nof the most terrible diseases, and his education is incomplete until he\r\nknows the exact truth from reliable sources.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Limited reading.]\r\n\r\n(5) It is not desirable that the young man should be set to read the\r\nnumerous books packed with more or less sensational reports on the\r\nsocial evil, for these may sometimes tend toward morbidity. Any young\r\nman who is not effectively appealed to by the above facts will not be\r\ninfluenced by the most voluminous reports on prostitution ever\r\npublished. Such reports are not useful for young men. They serve a good\r\npurpose by informing mature men and women and awakening them to the\r\nnecessity of legislation, education, and other weapons with which we\r\nmay fight the great black plague of social vice. For the average young\r\nman the books recommended in § 8 will give sufficient information and\r\nviewpoint.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Liaisons.]\r\n\r\n(6) Finally, the young man of adolescent years should be made to\r\nunderstand his responsibility for immorality that is not prostitution,\r\nthat is, extra-marital relations with his girl friends and without\r\npecuniary considerations. He should know the probability that he will\r\nruin a girl's life, either because illegitimacy occurs or because her\r\nreputation suffers. Even if such immoral liaisons are kept private,\r\nboth persons concerned are likely in after years to regret their\r\nillicit intimacy, especially if either marries another person.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34. _Need of More Refinement in Men_\r\n\r\nWhile refinement is a part of general culture, it is beyond doubt an\r\nimportant phase of the problems for the larger sex-education.\r\nElsewhere I have referred to the need of better understanding and\r\nbetter adjustment between men and women, especially in marriage.\r\nTowards such a desideratum refinement of men will contribute immensely.\r\nMany cultured women avoid marriage and many are unhappy in marriage\r\nbecause men, sometimes even educated men, lack refinement in manners,\r\nlanguage, and personal habits. In fact, \"lack of refinement\" is\r\naltogether too mild an expression, for many men are positively crude in\r\nmanners, coarse and vulgar in language, and disgusting in personal\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Manners and chivalry.]\r\n\r\nIn referring to manners, I am including not only the thousand and one\r\nlittle customs of everyday life among refined people, but also\r\nchivalric attitude towards all women. The world has changed vastly\r\nsince knighthood was in flower, but many men of to-day might well take\r\nlessons in the art of courtesy to women as practiced by the famous\r\nknights of the age of chivalry. This problem of manners will be an\r\nincreasingly important one, for here in America there is growing up a\r\ngeneration of boys who are far from chivalrous even to their mothers\r\nand sisters; and at the same time, the industrial competition and daily\r\nassociation of the two sexes is making young men realize that women are\r\nsimply human beings and not super beings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Language.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to language, I am thinking not so much of the general need\r\nof speech that is grammatically, rhetorically, and vocally polished,\r\nwhich no doubt determines many a woman's estimate of a man, as I have\r\nin mind the repelling effect upon sensitive women of language that is\r\ncoarse, vulgar, and profane. Hence, quite apart from the effect of low\r\nlanguage on character, I believe it worth while to work for refinement\r\nof language of young men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Personal habits.]\r\n\r\nAnd now with reference to personal habits, including cleanliness and\r\nrefinement of actions, the average women of all classes set splendid\r\nexamples for men of the same groups. It seems scarcely necessary to\r\nexplain in detail concerning unclean personal habits and vulgar\r\nactions. It requires no keen observer to find plenty of examples. Those\r\nwho have the training of boys should lose no opportunity to impress\r\nthem with the importance of refinement, and especially in all phases of\r\ntheir home life. It is in the most intimate life of the home that\r\nrefinement of personal habits of husbands may mean much to sensitive\r\nwives.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 35. _Dancing as a Sex Problem for Young Men_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dancing not to be eliminated.]\r\n\r\nIt is more than useless to discuss the question whether dancing ought\r\nto be eliminated from the social life of young people, for it has\r\nphysical, social, and æsthetic or dramatic values which will make\r\ndancing in some form or other coextensive with human life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Young people and dancing.]\r\n\r\nThose who deal with adolescent boys and girls ought to have some\r\nunderstanding of the facts for and against dancing as it may influence\r\nthe sexual control of young people, men especially. It is no longer\r\nsufficient to say, even to the young members of certain religious\r\ndenominations, that \"good people must not dance because it is wicked,\"\r\nfor in this doubting age young people will ask first what we mean by\r\nthe word \"wicked\" and then for proof that dancing is wicked. The time\r\nhas come when young people must be shown the scientific reasons if we\r\nwant them to avoid dancing or to dance with certain approved movements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dancing a sexual stimulant.]\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an accepted opinion among physiologists that dancing of\r\nany of the types that involve more or less closeness of contact between\r\nmen and women in pairs is likely to lead to sexual stimulation that at\r\ntimes may be consciously recognized by normal men, but probably is not\r\nidentified other than as general excitement by most women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Danger no reason for condemning dancing.]\r\n\r\nThe frank admission that dancing may sometimes stimulate sexual\r\nemotions is no condemnation of dancing, as many writers seem to think.\r\nWe must know first whether such emotions lead to good or harm. Sexual\r\nemotions are not in themselves wrong from any except a strictly æscetic\r\npoint of view. The fact that most intelligent men who in general are\r\nfrankly truthful confess that dancing may sometimes arouse sexual\r\nemotion simply raises the question whether such emotions lead directly\r\nto immoral relations with women or whether they lead, as does the best\r\nsocial life of men and women together, to a higher æsthetic\r\nappreciation of life as it involves the relations of the two sexes.\r\nAfter discussing this with many--yes, with more than a hundred--men and\r\nwomen, I am now convinced that dancing may have both results, depending\r\nupon the individuals. Dancing, then, has its dangers, but so have many\r\nother things that go to make up the most complete life. Eating may lead\r\nto gluttony, mountain-climbing may lead to a broken neck, swimming to\r\ndrowning, music and art to sensuality, and even love is not without\r\ndanger of bestial degradation. Life is full of dangers and we are\r\nconstantly striving to reduce them to a minimum. So we must refuse to\r\ncondemn dancing because of its admitted sexual dangers for young\r\npeople, unless it can be shown that the danger is so great and so\r\nunconquerable as to outweigh all the physical, social, and æsthetic\r\nconsiderations in favor of the pastime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dancing and immorality.]\r\n\r\nThat dancing is a strong incentive to immorality is contended by many\r\nwriters. A prominent physiologist has said that \"the dance is the\r\ndevil's procession so far as the young man is concerned.\" Others have\r\npointed to the immorality that is connected with the dance halls, and\r\nto the fact that waves of immorality of young men have often followed\r\nthe annual balls given in some high schools and colleges. Contrary to\r\nthe view which I formerly held, I am now inclined to think that it is\r\nnot fair to charge such immoral tendencies entirely to dancing, and\r\ntherefore condemn all dancing as immoral. It is no secret of sociology\r\nthat similar epidemics of immorality have been known to occur in\r\nconnection with Sunday-school picnics, camp meetings, expositions,\r\npolitical and other conventions, and religious revivals. Shall we\r\ncondemn all these along with dancing on the ground that they lead to\r\nimmorality? We say \"no\" because immorality is only an incident, not a\r\nresult in these cases. Likewise, I believe that dancing is but one of\r\nseveral factors that have led to immorality at the time of annual balls\r\nin high school and college. These are times of general tendency towards\r\ndissipation. Regular duties are cast aside, all the hygienic rules for\r\neating and sleeping are broken, there is unusual freedom of speech and\r\nmanners, available alcohol is freely used, emotions and not reason\r\nrules--these are characteristic of the college festivals that center\r\naround grand balls. In short, at such times there is a general let-down\r\nof usual standards and a swing back towards the barbaric festival of\r\nthe ancients. It is not surprising, then, that pent-up sexual instincts\r\nassert their force at such times, and dancing, if it occurs under such\r\nconditions is, of course, likely to increase the danger of moral\r\ncollapse because it incites sexual emotions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Regulation of dancing needed.]\r\n\r\nOur conclusion, then, is that it is unscientific to charge dancing with\r\nbeing the direct cause of immorality, when it has been only one in a\r\nseries of events. The facts warrant not condemnation of dancing as\r\nsomething utterly bad, but rather of allowing dancing to be associated\r\nwith conditions that are likely to lead to dissipation and immorality.\r\nUnless some argument other than that arising from the coincidence of\r\ndancing with dissipation and immorality is brought forward, we must\r\nconclude that dancing should be regulated and associated so that the\r\nadmitted dangers will be reduced to a minimum. Recognition of the\r\ndangers will lead mature people to see the importance of supervising\r\nand regulating dancing as a phase of the social life of young people.\r\nIt will lead to dancing that is improved along social and æsthetic\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Self-control necessary.]\r\n\r\nWhile improvement of dancing will reduce its dangers, it will not\r\neliminate the problem of self-control for normal young men. They must\r\nlearn to understand their own emotions. They should be forewarned that\r\nothers have found danger in dancing. They should know that some\r\nstrong-willed men have given up dancing when they found that it made\r\nmore intense the problem of sexual self-control, both mentally and\r\nphysically. They should know the increased danger if dancing is\r\nassociated with alcohol, vicious women, immodest dress, extreme freedom\r\nof conduct, and other morally depressing influences. Such knowledge\r\nalong with general sex-education will do much to make dancing not only\r\nsafe for average young men, but also helpful along social and æsthetic\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Extreme dances.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the extreme dances of the past five years, those who are\r\nwell informed concerning sexual problems know that many of these dances\r\nwhich polite society has copied from the dens of the underworld are\r\nvastly more dangerous than the standard dances.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36. _Dress of Women as a Sex Problem for Men_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dress and immorality.]\r\n\r\nSome of the students of sex problems assert with great emphasis that\r\ndress is the responsible factor in the sexual immorality of many men.\r\nAccepting the probability that there is some truth in the assertion,\r\nwhat is the solution of the problem? Should women in general adopt a\r\nstyle of dress which in lines and color is as repellently ugly as the\r\nofficial garb of women devotees of certain religious organizations? In\r\nshort, should women make their dress decidedly unobtrusive and\r\nunattractive in order that the sexual temptations of _some_ men may be\r\nreduced? The answer must be an emphatic negative. We need more beauty\r\nin this life of ours, and we cannot afford to omit any beauty which\r\nwomen express in dress. The pity is that economic conditions so often\r\nset a limit to such expression. We must believe in making every\r\npossible application of the beauty of nature and art to human life; and\r\nbeautiful dress on all women, and especially beautiful dress on\r\nattractive women, is the most important of such relations of beauty and\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dress and sexual appeal.]\r\n\r\nAccepting, then, beauty of dress as worthy of encouragement, what\r\nshall be done about its sexual attractiveness? This is a difficult\r\nquestion in these days with ever-changing fashions whose novelty makes\r\nextreme modes more dangerously attractive than they would be if\r\nuniversally adopted for a long term of years. But permanency of extreme\r\nstyles or general adaptation of modest ones are absolutely impossible\r\nfor the average woman of to-day. Hence, we must look forward to one\r\nextreme style following another. Young men must face the problem and\r\nfight their own battles. Like certain widespread diseases, there is\r\nconstant danger of infection, and the only hope for young men is in\r\nspecial education as a kind of protective inoculation against\r\ntemptation. This means that young men should be taught to see beauty in\r\nwoman's form, face, and dress without allowing themselves to get into\r\nhabits of sensual or physical emotions. Of course, for the normal young\r\nman there is sure to be more or less consciousness of emotions\r\nstimulated by the beautiful associated with women, but the individual\r\nman may train himself to turn such emotions into æsthetic or psychical\r\nlines instead of into those which are sensual, animalistic, or\r\nphysical. In this connection, I have long been of the opinion that\r\ntraining in art appreciation, especially of sculpture, may help many\r\nmen to an æsthetic attitude towards the human form.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that beauty of woman's face or form or dress has\r\nsometimes led men into immorality; but I often wonder whether such men\r\nof weak control would not have fallen sooner or later at the command\r\nof some other form of stimulation. At any rate, such men do not lead us\r\nto general conclusions, for there are many more men who have been led\r\nupward and not downward by the combined beauty of form, face, and dress\r\nof women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Duty of women.]\r\n\r\nWhile we refuse to excuse men who allow the sexual suggestiveness of\r\nwomen's dress to overcome their self-control, we should at the same\r\ntime recognize that women have themselves to blame for much of the\r\nexisting situation. I believe it is true that the average woman does\r\nnot understand how dress that makes unusual exposure of the body may\r\nmake a sexual appeal to men; but there is no such innocence on the part\r\nof the demi-mondes by whom many of the most dangerous styles are\r\nintroduced. Perhaps women of intelligence and good standing may some\r\nday come to realize their responsibility for wearing clothing that\r\nmeans unusual temptation for men. However, this seems Utopian in these\r\nyears when even women of the best groups are wearing equivocal dress;\r\nand so men must learn to fight their own battles against natural\r\ninstincts stirred to greater intensity by dress invented to increase\r\nthe trade of the women of the underworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 37. _The Problem of Self-control for Young Men_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference between sexes.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Automatic arousing of boys' instincts.]\r\n\r\nThe problem of control of the insistent passions of normal young men\r\nhas been unscientifically minimized by numerous writers and lecturers.\r\nIt should be noted that many of these are men who have long since\r\nforgotten the storms and stresses of their early manhood, and others\r\nare women who do not know the facts indicating that the sexual\r\ninstincts young men are characteristically active, aggressive,\r\nspontaneous, and automatic, while those of women _as a rule_ are\r\npassive and subject to awakening by external stimuli, especially in\r\nconnection with affection. Such forgetful men and uninformed women are\r\nprone to regard the lack of control of many young men as simply due to\r\n\"original sin,\" \"innate viciousness,\" \"bad companions,\" or\r\n\"irresistible temptations\"; and they overlook the great fact that\r\nmaintaining perfect sexual control in his pre-marital years is for the\r\naverage healthy young man a problem compared with which all others,\r\nincluding the alcoholic temptation, are of little significance. Such\r\nbeing the truth about young men, nothing is to be gained and much is to\r\nbe lost if older people fail to take an understanding and sympathetic\r\nattitude. I question whether any young man has ever been helped through\r\nhis adolescent crises by such oft-repeated assertions as that \"there is\r\nno more reason that a young man should go astray than that his sister\r\nshould,\" or, in other words, that \"continence is as easy for a young\r\nman as for a girl of similar age.\" An observing young man will doubt\r\nsuch statements, and if he has had access to scientific information, he\r\nwill feel sure that there has been an attempt to influence him by the\r\nkind of exaggeration commonly adopted by specialists in moral\r\npreachments. The plain truth is that there is a physiological \"reason\"\r\nor explanation, although not a justification for failure of\r\nself-control. Even if we accept the improbable statement of some\r\nwriters that boys and girls are in early adolescence potentially equal\r\nin sexual instincts and assuming that they may be protected equally\r\nagainst vicious habits, we must not forget that every normal boy passes\r\nin early puberty through peculiar physiological changes that arouse his\r\ndeepest instincts. I refer especially to the frequent occurrence of\r\ninvoluntary sexual tumescence and to the occasional nocturnal\r\nemissions, which processes leave the boy in no doubt whatever as to the\r\nnature, source, and desirability of sexual pleasure. Especially is this\r\ntrue of the automatic emissions that usually follow continence of\r\nhealthy young men, for in connection with such relief of seminal\r\npressure every nerve center of the sexual mechanism seems to be\r\ninvolved in the culminating nerve storm of which the awakening\r\nindividual is often quite pleasurably conscious. In short, as men\r\nlooking backward to their early manhood well understand, the physical\r\nsensations that come into the normal sexual experience of the\r\nadolescent boy are different only in degree of intensity from those\r\nwhich later are concomitants of sexual union. Such, in brief, is the\r\nphysiological history of the normal adolescent boy, and one who has\r\nfallen into even most limited masturbation will probably be still more\r\nconscious of the fact that the ordinary sequence of events in the\r\nactivity of the sexual organs leads to intense excitement that has\r\nalmost irresistible attractiveness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Average young women different.]\r\n\r\nNow, most scientifically-trained women seem to agree that there are no\r\ncorresponding phenomena in the early pubertal life of the normal young\r\nwoman who has good health. A limited number of mature women, some of\r\nthem physicians, report having experienced in the pubertal years\r\nlocalized tumescence and other disturbances which made them definitely\r\nconscious of sexual instincts. However, it should be noted that most of\r\nthese are known to have had a personal history including one or more\r\nsuch abnormalities as dysmenorrhea, uterine displacement, pathological\r\novaries, leucorrhea, tuberculosis, masturbation, neurasthenia,\r\nnymphomania, or other disturbances which are sufficient to account for\r\nlocal sexual stimulation. In short, such women are not normal. Such\r\nfacts have led many physicians to the generalization that the average\r\nhealthy adolescent girl does not undergo normal spontaneous changes\r\nwhich make her definitely conscious of the nature, source, and\r\ndesirability of localized sexual pleasure. On the contrary, such\r\nconsciousness commonly comes to many only as the result of stimuli\r\narising in connection with affection.[18] Clearly it is nonsense to\r\nclaim that the sexual temptations arising within the individual are\r\nequal for the two sexes. Potentially, girls may have passions as strong\r\nas boys, but they do not become so definitely and spontaneously\r\nconscious of their latent instincts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Helping the young man.]\r\n\r\nThus considering the available facts regarding the physiological\r\nreasons for the sexual tendencies of men, it seems to me that we gain\r\nnothing in trying to minimize the young man's sexual problems, for he\r\nis quite conscious that they are insistent. Far better it is that\r\nmature men who know life in its completeness should make the young man\r\nfeel that his problems are not new, not insignificant, and that many\r\nanother man has met and solved them in such a way as to make life more\r\nfull of real happiness. Such sympathetic helpfulness will mean\r\nsomething to a young man, but he cannot be led far by one who in his\r\nown early experience has not learned both the strength and the mastery\r\nof the sexual instincts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women should know.]\r\n\r\nIn another lecture I have discussed the proposition that it would be\r\nbetter for all concerned if women could have scientific understanding\r\nof the physiological facts concerning the sexual tendencies of men, not\r\nto make women more lenient or forgiving towards the mistakes of men,\r\nbut rather to enable women to play an important part in the necessary\r\nadjustments through helpful comradeship. This last phrase will mean\r\nnothing to many people, but in many a modern home a well-informed wife\r\nhas been able to lead the way to the satisfactory solution of the\r\nfundamental problems of life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Self-control in marriage.]\r\n\r\nThere is another and an all-important phase of the problem of teaching\r\nself-control which is commonly overlooked by those who are trying to\r\nhelp young men solve their greatest problems. I have in mind the need\r\nof self-control in marriage. Most writers and lecturers who emphasize\r\nthe arguments for absolute self-control or continence before marriage,\r\nomit all reference to marital life. The natural inference, and one\r\nwidely followed, is that the only moral duty of a young man is to\r\ncontrol his intense desires and avoid illicit relations until sexual\r\nabandon is permitted under the license of the law and the benediction\r\nof the church. Such, I submit, is a fair conclusion for young men to\r\ndraw from at least ninety per cent of the sex-education literature that\r\nis current to-day.\r\n\r\nNow, I believe this is all wrong. In fact, I am so radical as to\r\nbelieve that the intelligent women of the world would gain more from\r\ntemperance and unselfishness and delicacy of men in sexual functioning\r\nin marriage than from sexual continence before marriage. Of course, I\r\ndo not propose that ideal sexual conditions in marriage may justify\r\npre-marital incontinence, but I make this sharp contrast simply to\r\nemphasize the belief that sexual intemperance and selfishness of men in\r\nmarriage causes more mental and physical suffering of women than does\r\nsexual incontinence of men before marriage, and I am not forgetting the\r\nvast problem of social diseases and prostitution.\r\n\r\nI urge, then, that those who attempt to direct young men through the\r\nmazes of sexual life should hold up ideals not only of pre-marital\r\ncontinence, but also of post-nuptial temperance and harmonious\r\nadjustment between husband and wife. This post-nuptial problem is far\r\nmore difficult to solve, for the intimacy of married life, especially\r\nin the earlier years, is sure to offer stimuli that are likely to make\r\nsexual instincts more insistent than those that come from celibate\r\nrepression. However, self-control and temperance in marriage is no new\r\nand unattainable ideal, and harmonious adjustment of men and women in\r\nmarriage is far more common than the pessimists would have us believe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38. _The Mental Side of the Young Man's Sexual Life_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effect of mental imagery.]\r\n\r\nMost of the discussions of the education of young men for moral living\r\nhave centered around the problem of keeping him from physical sexual\r\nactivity. So far as society is concerned, this is the great\r\ndesideratum. So far as the individual life is concerned, it is\r\nimportant that self-control should extend to mental imagery. Professors\r\nGeddes and Thomson have well said, in \"Sex,\" that \"while anatomical\r\nchastity is a moral achievement, it is not the deepest virtue. The\r\nincisive declaration: 'Whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her\r\nhath committed adultery with her already in his heart' expresses an\r\neven more searching standard, and modern science brings home to us the\r\nradical importance of our reflex thought and deep-down impulses, which\r\nappear to bulk largely in molding our lives and the lives of those who\r\nmay spring from us.\" In language adapted to the understanding of\r\naverage young men, this idea should be emphasized.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of some physiologists the greatest harm done to the\r\nindividual who has long been a victim of masturbation is in the\r\ncentering of the attention on imaginary sexual situations. This is\r\nespecially true of mental masturbation. Hence, the relation of\r\nmasturbation to the possible establishment of a disordered mental state\r\nshould be known by adolescent boys and young men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Control of thoughts.]\r\n\r\nIt appears from the experience of many men that strenuous work and play\r\nare the only efficient weapons for driving sexual images into the\r\nbackground of the mind. This applies not only to sordid and lewd\r\nthoughts of unchaste sexual situations, but also to the mental images\r\nthat are inevitably associated with the purest affection and which\r\nshould be trained to obey when calm reason so orders.\r\n\r\nThe following literature will be especially helpful to young men: W.S.\r\nHall's \"Sexual Hygiene for Men,\" or his \"Sexual Knowledge\"; Exner's\r\n\"The Rational Sex Life for Men\"; Morrow's \"The Young Man's Problem,\"\r\nand \"Health and Hygiene of Sex for College Students\"; King's \"Fight for\r\nCharacter\" (Y.M.C.A.); and the chapter on Ethics of Sex in \"Sex\" by\r\nGeddes and Thomson.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] The first three pamphlets are published by the Society of\r\nSanitary and Moral Prophylaxis (New York); the Exner pamphlets by the\r\nAssociation Press (New York).\r\n\r\n[18] This is really not surprising if we remember the peculiarities of\r\nhuman instincts mentioned in an earlier lecture (§ 3).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nSPECIAL SEX-INSTRUCTION FOR MATURING YOUNG WOMEN\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parents would limit knowledge of daughters.]\r\n\r\nIt was my original plan to make this lecture parallel with the\r\npreceding one for young men, but much discussion with parents and with\r\nscientifically trained women whose suggestions and criticisms I value\r\nhas shown me that there is no consensus of opinion as to what should be\r\ntaught to young women between eighteen and twenty-two years of age. I\r\nhave found many fathers and mothers who think that their boys of\r\nfourteen or fifteen should be informed as suggested in the preceding\r\nlecture; but concerning some of the facts for boys these same parents\r\nwere doubtful whether their daughters ought to know before twenty, and\r\nsome of them have said twenty-five and even thirty. Some of them have\r\nsaid that they see no reason why an unmarried young woman of the\r\nprotected group should know much more than a very limited amount of\r\npersonal hygiene; but most of these people were decidedly hazy as to\r\nhow the young woman about to marry may be sure of getting belated\r\nknowledge. In short, all along the line I have found intelligent\r\nparents and others who believe in very thorough sex-instruction for\r\nboys, but that \"nice\" girls should be kept as ignorant and innocent as\r\npossible. With such disagreement existing, it is evidently not possible\r\nto make such specific recommendations as have been made for boys.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39. _The Young Woman's Attitude towards Manhood_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Women should have ideals.]\r\n\r\nAmong those who agree heartily with the proposition that by education\r\nthe young man's attitude towards womanhood (§ 30) should be cultivated\r\nI find, to my surprise, many who object to any parallel attempt to\r\ninfluence young woman's ideals of manhood. I say that I am surprised\r\nbecause it has long seemed to me that many of the faults of men are\r\nlargely traceable to the fact that women as a sex have not been able to\r\nhold a high standard for manhood; and, therefore, I wonder when some\r\nthinking women question the desirability of trying to influence young\r\nwomen by organized instruction. Of course, we must not forget that\r\nbefore the coming of the economic and social freedom of women there\r\nwere very few of them who were able to maintain a stand for their\r\nideals of manhood; but this is no longer true in a great and rapidly\r\nincreasing group of the individualized and educated classes. Therefore,\r\nit seems clear that if the better groups of women want a higher type of\r\nmanhood capable of better adjustment in marriage, it is important that\r\nthey consider ways and means of molding the minds of young women with\r\nreference to ideal manhood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ideals and disappointment.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally I have met a strange view of life in some men and women\r\nwho have grown pessimistic from revelations concerning the\r\nsexual-social problems and who think that true manhood is so rare that\r\nemphasizing it with young women will lead to ideals that can rarely be\r\nrealized in actual life; and therefore, for women so influenced there\r\nwill be increasing discontent and disappointment in marriage or\r\ndeliberate celibacy. No doubt this is in part true, as witness the many\r\nhighly educated women who have written or said that there seem to be\r\nfew attractive marriageable men of their own age. However, it is rare\r\nindeed that such women say that life would have meant more without the\r\nhigher education and its resulting ideals that have stood in the way of\r\nmarriage such as might be happy for uneducated women. This is in line\r\nwith the fact that many cultivated men and women find that education\r\nhas given unattained ideals and unsatisfied ambitions and strenuous\r\nlife and disappointments, but it is rare that they long for the\r\ncare-free and animal-like happiness of the tropical savage. We must\r\nremember that education gives us keener feeling for life's pains, but\r\nit also compensates by giving soul-satisfying appreciation of its joys.\r\nSo it seems reasonable to believe that while educating young women to\r\nbelieve in and demand a higher ideal of manhood in its natural\r\nrelations to womanhood will certainly make disappointments more\r\nheart-pressing for some, it will just as surely make realization the\r\nsupreme happiness of others. And as adjustment of manhood and womanhood\r\nthrough the larger sex-education becomes more and more abundant and\r\nmore and more perfected, the sum total of human happiness will\r\nincrease.\r\n\r\nLooking thus towards the ultimate good, I must refuse to accept the\r\nhopeless and depressing view that all young women should be kept\r\nignorant of their relation to men and life in order that the absence of\r\nideals of manhood may protect some women against possible\r\ndisappointment by men.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40. _The Young Woman's Attitude towards Love and Marriage_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reasons not same as for men.]\r\n\r\nIn the preceding lecture to the parents and teachers of young men I\r\nemphasized the importance of developing the young man's ideals of love\r\nand marriage primarily because such ideals have so often helped men\r\nmorally in character-formation and character-protection. I feel sure\r\nthat this is not the chief reason why the ideals of young women should\r\nbe developed along parallel lines. On the contrary, it seems to me that\r\nthose representative women are right who think that the first reason\r\nwhy ideals of young women should be influenced is that there is need of\r\na radical change in the attitude of a very common type of young women\r\nwho are flippant and disrespectful concerning love and marriage, and\r\nwhose influence on the morals of men is decidedly bad because they\r\noften give unguided young men their first and strongest impressions\r\nconcerning women. A second reason, which is equally applicable to both\r\nsexes, is that advance understanding of the relations of love and\r\nmarriage is likely to lead to happy and satisfactory adjustment in\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Men naturally lead in love.]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the flippant and disrespectful attitude concerning affairs of\r\nthe heart develops in many young women because they do not consciously\r\nfeel in advance of experience the demand for affection which comes so\r\nnaturally and spontaneously to many, possibly to all, normal young men\r\nwhose views of life have not been artificially twisted. I fully realize\r\nthe treacherous nature of the ground on which walks one who tries to\r\ncompare the two sexes concerning their relative attitudes towards love,\r\nbut certain it is that the novelist's descriptions of men as the\r\nleaders and aggressors in love is not fiction but the common fact of\r\nreal life. Man's tendency towards leadership in love is not\r\nscientifically explained by any superficial assumption that established\r\nsocial conventions have repressed an original spontaneity of women. On\r\nthe contrary, there are the best of physiological and psychological\r\nreasons for believing that the social conventions have arisen as an\r\nexpression of masculine aggressiveness and natural tendency towards\r\nleadership in affairs of the heart. The accepted fact is that many\r\nyoung women have no understanding of or demand for affection until\r\nexperience has taught them its place in life. In the records of real\r\nlife, as well as in fiction, many a young woman's possibilities of\r\nhappiness have been lost because she did not understand herself when\r\nlove came into her experience.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Affection in marriage.]\r\n\r\nAnother side to the problem of the young woman's relation to love and\r\nmarriage is brought to our attention by the lamentable fact that many\r\nwives lose interest in devoted husbands when the children come. This is\r\nprobably true in at least half the families; and many matrimonial\r\ndisharmonies are the result. This is really one of the greatest\r\nproblems of marriage which cultured women should consider seriously;\r\nfor even more than in most other sex problems, it is one for the\r\nsolution of which women are in a position to take the leading part.\r\nThis problem is especially important in these days when the household\r\ninefficiency, personal extravagance, and desire for social position of\r\nnumerous young women of eighteen to thirty are having an enormous\r\ninfluence in advancing the age of marriage because many of the best\r\ntypes of young men pause and consider seriously the impossibility of\r\nadjusting a small salary to the ideas of their women friends as to what\r\nis the minimum of a family budget. Add to such facts a growing\r\npessimism of young men regarding inconstant affections of wives with\r\nchildren, and the need of special educational attack is evident.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The duty of parents.]\r\n\r\nFrom whatever side we look at the question whether the larger\r\nsex-education should somehow try to mold the ideals of young women\r\nwith regard to love and marriage, we see reasons why parents should\r\nencourage their maturing daughters to get some advance understanding of\r\nsuch relation. If parents are themselves unable to help their daughters\r\nto this understanding, they can at least exert great influence by their\r\nown attitude, and they can approve the reading of books, and perhaps\r\nthere may be opportunity for hearing lectures by women who understand\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to good literature that will help in this line, there are\r\nchapters in many of the books mentioned at the end of this lecture, and\r\nin more or less indirect form in the general literature suggested in\r\nthe preceding lectures concerning young men, and in § 12 which deals\r\nwith the general educational problem of marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41. _Reasons for Pre-marital Continence of Women_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Many women do not need reasons.]\r\n\r\nMany women who have lived protected lives have declared themselves\r\nunable to understand why a young woman should need reasons for\r\npre-marital continence; and these women are probably right so far as\r\nthe great majority of the daughters of families in good social\r\nconditions are concerned. As pointed out in earlier lectures, there is\r\nabundant evidence that the average adolescent girl who is protected\r\nagainst external sexual stimuli and influenced constantly by the\r\nprevailing ideals which demand chastity of women, is not likely to need\r\nany arguments why she should avoid pre-marital incontinence. Moreover,\r\nthere seems to be little danger that the average girl with good social\r\nenvironment will ever question her ideals of chastity unless under the\r\nstress of overwhelming affection; in other words, there is little\r\npossibility that such women will be interested in the strictly\r\nmechanical, non-affectionate, and unsentimental sexual relations which\r\nmust inevitably characterize the common prostitution of men.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Unprotected girls.]\r\n\r\nNote that I am referring to the average young woman in good social\r\nenvironment, and for the moment omitting the vast class of so-called\r\n\"unprotected\" girls. Moreover, I am speaking of the \"average,\" and I am\r\nnot forgetting that medical journals and books record many exceptions.\r\nNevertheless, we must not be misled by medical literature, for\r\nnaturally the physician sees the women whose lack of health leads them\r\nto seek professional advice, and it is well known that in sexual lines\r\nwomen commonly become decidedly unhealthy before they consult\r\nphysicians. As testimony concerning the average normal women, I have\r\nthe greatest confidence in the statements of thoughtful women with\r\nsound scientific attitude; and such are my authority for the view that\r\nmaintaining pre-marital continence is not one of the serious problems\r\nfor the average young woman with good domestic and social environment.\r\n\r\nNow, while I admit in advance that the problem of pre-marital\r\ncontinence is not of great significance in the personal lives of the\r\ngreat majority of the type of women who are likely to hear or read this\r\nlecture, I do believe that this is the type of women who ought to think\r\nover the problem as it concerns the atypical girl of good social groups\r\nand the \"unprotected\" girl of more unfortunate groups. I cannot see,\r\ntherefore, why it is not best and safest that all girls should learn\r\nfrom parents or reliable books or teachers the main reasons for\r\npre-marital chastity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The girl who needs help.]\r\n\r\nThe atypical girls of good social groups who need guidance regarding\r\npre-marital continence are of two types: either one with intensive\r\nsexuality which is often modifiable by medical or surgical treatment;\r\nor one of probably normal instincts but with radical sexual philosophy.\r\nThe first type needs not only emphatic instruction regarding\r\ncontinence, but more often medical help, either for general health or\r\nfor correction of localized sexual disturbance. The second type must be\r\ntreated exactly as suggested for young men, because they are the women\r\nwhose anarchistic repudiation of laws and convention in general has led\r\nto their acceptance of a _single_ standard of morality for men and\r\nwomen, but one of freedom from monogamic ideals. This type of women,\r\nlong well known in the student groups of Paris and in Russian\r\nuniversities, is becoming more and more evident in America, especially\r\namong some well-educated young women who have dropped their ideals of\r\nchastity because they have found attractiveness in more or less\r\nsuperficial studies of radical socialism. Many of these radical women\r\nfrankly say that they would like to marry the \"right man,\" but failing\r\nto find that rare species, they claim their right to sexual freedom in\r\nmore or less capricious liaisons. Others of these women are so highly\r\nindividualized that marriage is beneath their contempt, either because\r\nit will \"interfere with a career\" or because the legal aspects and\r\necclesiastical ceremonies still suggest the old-time subjection of the\r\nwife to the husband. Women who are in a position to know from personal\r\nknowledge of radical people declare that there are still relatively few\r\neducated women who deliberately cut loose from monogamic standards; and\r\nthat they are most commonly found among certain intimate and\r\nunconventional groups of students and professional workers, especially\r\nthose who are united in \"Bohemian life\" by artistic or literary\r\ninterests. But while such sexually anarchistic women are not common in\r\nAmerica, there is reason for fearing that, unless some unexpected check\r\ncomes to this undercurrent towards sexual freedom, it may be found ten\r\nor twenty years hence that a surprisingly large number, but _never a\r\nmajority_, of unmarried young women have fallen into the sexual\r\npromiscuity that is so common among unmarried men of the same ages.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Radical sex literature.]\r\n\r\nChief of the influences that lead a certain number of well-educated\r\nyoung women towards sexual freedom is radical printed matter. We are\r\nnow getting in America a wide distribution of bold literature of the\r\n\"free love\" type, some of it with a scientific superficiality that\r\nwill convince many beginners in the study of sexual problems. Much of\r\nthis literature is translation or adaptation of books and articles by\r\nEuropean authors; and I have previously remarked that abroad the ideals\r\nof sexual morality--and judging from the Great War, of morality in\r\nother lines--is frankly quite different from that upheld here. But some\r\nof this radical literature is American in origin. In addition to\r\ncertain books and pamphlets, which might be advertised by giving names,\r\nI think of two New York medical journals, with a popular circulation,\r\nedited by a successful but much criticized physician, which rarely\r\npublish an issue without frank approval and even arguments for\r\nextra-marital relations other than prostitution, particularly for those\r\nwho for one reason or another, unwelcome or voluntary, are leading\r\ncelibate lives. The influence of such writings on young women who are\r\ninclined towards radicalism in all things is probably enormous, and it\r\nis unfortunate that vigorous opposition literature is not published and\r\nwidely circulated.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Same instruction as for men.]\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the problem of pre-marital continence\r\nis not limited to young men, for the \"unprotected\" girl from a\r\nlow-grade home and environment, and the uninformed girl from the best\r\nof homes, and the radical girl from the most educated circles may,\r\ninnocently or deliberately, select the pathway to unchastity. For these\r\nkinds of young women the educational problem is the same as for young\r\nmen. They should have essentially the same instruction. And, in the\r\ncase of both sexes, it is only by contrasting the good and evil that\r\neducation can point out the worth-whileness of chastity.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Indirect responsibility.]\r\n\r\nThere is a special aspect of the problem of pre-marital chastity of men\r\nthat young women should understand, and that is their indirect\r\nresponsibility for the unchastity of many men. In discussing dancing\r\n(§ 35) and extreme dress (§ 36), it has been indicated that women as a\r\nsex have a tremendous responsibility for the temptations of men. The\r\nsame is true in the case of flirting or more extreme familiarities with\r\nmen. However sure a young woman may feel of her own power of\r\nself-control, she should not consider lightly her possible part in a\r\nchain of events which may lead men to unchastity with other women. Many\r\na man driven into the white heat of passion by thoughtless or\r\ndeliberate acts of a pure girl has gone direct to seek relief of\r\ntension in the underworld. Of course, the girl in this case is not\r\ndirectly responsible for the downfall of the man; but I wonder if there\r\nis not moral, if not legal, responsibility for one who knowingly leads\r\nor helps another to the brink of a precipice from which he voluntarily\r\nfalls.\r\n\r\nI am perfectly well aware that many good people will be horrified by\r\nthe very suggestion that young women should be taught their\r\nresponsibility for their men associates. Some will declare that the\r\nadvocates of sex-education propose to destroy the innocence and romance\r\nin young women's lives. Others of the horrified ones will remain\r\ncomplacent because they believe that unchastity is caused by \"innate\r\ndepravity\" of men. I am sorry to disagree with such people who are\r\nsincere, but the established facts point clearly to the conclusion that\r\nit is the duty of the mothers and teachers of girls to make them\r\nunderstand their relations to men and their responsibility for helping\r\nyoung men avoid sexual temptations. This is necessary when innocence\r\nstands in the way of the maximum safety and happiness of young people.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42. _Need of Optimistic and Æsthetic Views of Sex by Women_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Many women pessimistic concerning sexuality.]\r\n\r\nThe most significant point in the sex-education movement at present is\r\nthe fact that numerous women of the most intelligent groups are tending\r\nrapidly towards accepting an optimistic and æsthetic view of sexual\r\nrelationships so far as these are normal and ethical and guided by\r\naffection. However, this higher philosophy of sexual life is still very\r\nfar from being universal among educated women, and it is probably true\r\nthat to the great majority of them sexuality has no æsthetic meaning\r\nbut is simply a very troublesome physical function and an animal method\r\nfor perpetuating the human species. That such an attitude should be\r\ncommon is not surprising, for in recent years numerous educated women\r\nhave gained abundant information concerning abnormal sexuality, while\r\nvery few have caught glimpses of the higher possibilities of the\r\nsexual functions. The truth is that it has been and still is difficult\r\nfor most women to get well-balanced knowledge of sexual normality.\r\nThere are hundreds of books and pamphlets that deal with amazing\r\nboldness with the sexual mistakes of human life, but there is not in\r\ngeneral circulation to-day any printed matter which deals with normal\r\nsexual life with anything like the frankness and directness that is\r\ncommon in widely circulated literature on social vice and its\r\nconcomitant diseases. Likewise, it is difficult for women to get the\r\ntrue view of sexual life from personal sources, for the vulgar side of\r\nsexuality is the one usually discussed by most people, some of whom\r\nrevel in obscenity, some have had personal experiences that have caused\r\nineradicable bitterness, and some more or less sincerely believe that\r\nknowledge of vice is of value as a safeguard or an antidote. The bright\r\nside of the sexual story is rarely told in conversation, either because\r\nit is unfamiliar or because it is the sacred secret between pairs of\r\nindividuals who together have found life in all its completeness.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Æsthetic outlook.]\r\n\r\nFortunately, this depressing emphasis on sexual abnormality is\r\nbeginning to disappear, and we see sure signs of coming attention to\r\nsexual health rather than to disease and to purity rather than to vice.\r\nLeading women are beginning to give, through the impersonal medium of\r\nscience and general literature, some definite and helpful testimony\r\nconcerning the pathway to the essential good that is bound up in\r\nsexuality. It is especially important that young women of culture\r\nshould be helped to this point of view, and as far as possible before\r\nthey learn much concerning the dark problems that have originated from\r\nfailure to keep sexual functions sacred to affection and possible\r\nparenthood. The educated women of to-day who have acquired and retained\r\nfaith in the essential goodness of human sexual possibilities, and who\r\nat the same time have an understanding of the mistakes that weak humans\r\nare wont to make, are sure to play a most important part as teachers\r\nand mothers and leaders in the movement which is already guiding\r\nnumerous intelligent men and women to a purified and noble view of the\r\nsexual relationships. As I see the big problems that demand\r\nsex-education, the future will depend largely upon the attitude of\r\nwomen. It is an essential part of the feministic movement. In the past\r\nthere have been many alarming signs of a destructive sex antagonism\r\nthat charged men with full responsibility for existing sex problems.\r\nBut the advance guards of feminism are beginning to recognize that\r\nthere are all-essential relationships between the sexes, and that only\r\nin sex coöperation can there be any permanent solution of the great\r\nquestions. It is a great advance from the sex hostility of Christabel\r\nPankhurst's \"Plain Facts on a Great Evil\" to the co-working attitude of\r\nLouise Creighton's \"Social Disease and How to Fight It,\" of Olive\r\nSchreiner's \"Woman and Labor,\" of Ellen Key's \"Love and Marriage,\" and\r\nof Gascoigne Hartley's \"Truth About Woman,\" all of which give us hope\r\nthat women with optimistic and æsthetic interpretation of sex are\r\ncoming to take the lead towards a better understanding of the relations\r\nof sex and life.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 43. _Other Problems for Young Women_\r\n\r\nConcerning several other problems that have been discussed with special\r\nreference to young men, it seems best that all young women should be\r\ninformed sometime between sixteen and twenty-two, the age limit\r\ndepending upon maturity of the individual, home life, and social\r\nenvironment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Prostitution.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to prostitution, it seems important that girls should know\r\nthe essential facts recommended in the lecture concerning boys. The\r\n\"unprotected\" girl of low-grade environment will often need some of\r\nthis knowledge before she is fourteen (and in some cases, even twelve)\r\nyears old. On the other hand, the average \"protected\" girl need not\r\nknow until several years later. It seems possible that too early\r\nfamiliarity with the existence of sexual vice might tend to make some\r\nyoung women accept it as part of the established order of things; and,\r\nhence, the girl whose environment is protective and whose moral\r\ntraining has been complete will be perfectly safe without knowledge of\r\nvice and will be more likely to take an opposition attitude if she\r\nlearns the facts concerning prostitution when she is approaching\r\nmaturity. Even then the essential information should be given in such\r\na way that the young woman will see the gravity of the social situation\r\nand, at the same time, not develop a spirit of sex hostility. Here,\r\nagain, I must recommend Louise Creighton's \"Social Disease and How to\r\nFight It\" as not only pointing out the nature of the great evil, but\r\nalso recognizing that the existing situation can never be improved\r\nexcept by the sympathetic coöperation of the best men and women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dancing.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to dancing, young girls should be taught that certain forms\r\nof this exercise are not approved by the most refined people. Before\r\nmaturity, they should not know the physiological reason for this\r\ndisapproval. In fact, I know many men and women who think it best that\r\nmost women, even mature, should not have their attention called to the\r\nsexual dangers of dancing. For my part, I cannot see how women with\r\nsuch ignorance can coöperate with the best men in reducing the admitted\r\ndangers to a minimum.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dress.]\r\n\r\nWith regard to dress as a sexual problem, some mothers think they can\r\nhandle the problem with their young daughters by emphasizing modesty\r\nand without further explanation; but the drawing power of fashions is\r\nso great that most young women are quick to revise their ideas of\r\nmodesty to suit the latest style. Is it too much to hope that large\r\nnumbers of young women would accept such facts as were stated in the\r\nlecture for young men (§ 36), and would be sincere enough to dress so\r\nthat their attractiveness may appeal more to the æsthetic and less to\r\nthe physical natures of men?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Merely a man's views.]\r\n\r\nIn this lecture concerning the special teaching of young women, I have\r\nattempted nothing more than an outline of the impressions that I have\r\ngained from books and from representative women who are interested in\r\nthe larger sex-education. I have not tried to make the discussion as\r\nextensive as that for young men, first, because I cannot believe that\r\nyoung women in general need so much special instruction; and, second,\r\nbecause only women can adequately advise concerning the sex-educational\r\nproblems of young women. However, since the women who might be expected\r\nto know the truth about women have failed to agree on so many points,\r\nit may be worth while for a man to contribute some suggestions based on\r\nthe most scientific information offered by some very reliable women.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Books.]\r\n\r\nAmong the books which touch the special problems for young women, I am\r\nmost favorably impressed by the following: Hall's \"Life Problems\" in\r\nthe first thirty-two pages is adapted for girls of twelve to fourteen,\r\nand the remainder for older girls. Some parents are not enthusiastic\r\nabout the story form, but the facts are well selected and presented.\r\nThe last chapter of Smith's \"Three Gifts of Life\" is worth reading, but\r\nthe first chapters are unscientific. For almost mature young women,\r\nthere are chapters of Rummel's \"Womanhood and Its Development,\" of\r\nWood-Allen's \"What a Young Woman Should Know,\" of Lowry's \"Herself,\"\r\nand of Galbraith's \"Four Epochs of a Woman's Life.\" The last two are\r\ndecidedly medical in point of view. The part for girls in Scharlieb and\r\nSibley's \"Youth and Sex,\" and some chapters of March's \"Towards Racial\r\nHealth,\" are good. The last two chapters of Geddes and Thomson's \"Sex\"\r\nwill be appreciated by many intellectual young women. Hepburn's\r\nsentimental little story \"The Perfect Gift\" (Crist Co., 3¢) has helped\r\nmany young people improve their æsthetic outlook. There are some\r\nhelpful ideas in Henderson's \"What It Is To Be Educated\" (Houghton\r\nMifflin Co.). While disagreeing (§ 46) with Dr. Richard Cabot's extreme\r\nemphasis on a mystical religious solution for problems of sex, I\r\nrecognize that many young women have been helped by his \"The Christian\r\nApproach to Social Morality\" (Y.W.C.A.), and by his \"What Men Live\r\nBy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCRITICISMS OF SEX-EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding lectures we have considered the arguments for\r\nsex-instruction. It will now be helpful to review some of the writings\r\nof those who oppose or at least point out the defects of the commonly\r\naccepted plan of sex-instruction. None of those writers whom I shall\r\nquote is known to be absolutely opposed to all sex-instruction, but\r\nsome of them would limit the instruction so much that there would be\r\nlittle hope of the general movement having an important influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 44. _A Plea for Reticence Concerning Sex_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Agnes Repplier.]\r\n\r\nMiss Agnes Repplier, the distinguished essayist, discusses in the\r\n_Atlantic Monthly_ (March, 1914) the plain speech on sex topics that\r\nare before the public to-day. While she holds no brief for \"the\r\nconspiracy of silence,\" which she admits was \"a menace in its day,\" she\r\nmaintains that \"the breaking of silence need not imply the opening of\r\nthe flood-gates of speech.\" She goes on to say:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Present frankness.]\r\n\r\n    \"It was never meant by those who first cautiously advised a\r\n    clearer understanding of sexual relations and hygienic rules that\r\n    everybody should chatter freely respecting these grave issues;\r\n    that teachers, lecturers, novelists, story-writers, militants,\r\n    dramatists, social workers, and magazine editors should copiously\r\n    impart all they know, or assume they know, to the world. The lack\r\n    of restraint, the lack of balance, the lack of soberness and\r\n    common sense were never more apparent than in the obsession of sex\r\n    which has set us all ababbling about matters once excluded from\r\n    the amenities of conversation.\r\n\r\n    \"Knowledge is the cry. Crude, undigested knowledge, without limit\r\n    and without reserve. Give it to boys, give it to girls, give it to\r\n    children. No other force is taken account of by the visionaries\r\n    who--in defiance, or in ignorance of history--believe that evil\r\n    understood is evil conquered.\r\n\r\n    \"We hear too much about the thirst for knowledge from people keen\r\n    to quench it. Dr. Edward L. Keyes, president of the Society of\r\n    Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, advocates the teaching of\r\n    sex-hygiene to children, because he thinks that it is the kind of\r\n    information that children are eagerly seeking. 'What is this\r\n    topic,' he asks, 'that all these little ones are questioning over,\r\n    mulling over, fidgeting over, worrying over? Ask your own\r\n    memories.'\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: One child's life.]\r\n\r\n    \"I do ask my memory in vain for the answer Dr. Keyes anticipates.\r\n    A child's life is so full, and everything that enters it seems of\r\n    supreme importance. I fidgeted over my hair which would not curl.\r\n    I worried over my examples which never came out right. I mulled\r\n    (though unacquainted with the word) over every piece of sewing put\r\n    into my incapable fingers, which could not be trained to hold a\r\n    needle. I imagined I was stolen by brigands, and became--by virtue\r\n    and intelligence--spouse of a patriotic outlaw in a frontierless\r\n    land. I asked artless questions which brought me into discredit\r\n    with my teachers, as, for example, who 'massacred' St.\r\n    Bartholomew. But vital facts, the great laws of propagation, were\r\n    matters of but casual concern crowded out of my life and out of my\r\n    companions' lives (in a convent boarding-school) by the more\r\n    stirring happenings of every day. How could we fidget over\r\n    obstetrics when we were learning to skate, and our very dreams\r\n    were a medley of ice and bumps? How could we worry over 'natural\r\n    laws' in the face of a tyrannical interdict which lessened our\r\n    chances of breaking our necks by forbidding us to coast down a\r\n    hill covered with trees? The children to be pitied, the children\r\n    whose minds become infected with unwholesome curiosity are those\r\n    who lack cheerful recreation, religious teaching, and the fine\r\n    corrective of work. A playground or a swimming pool will do more\r\n    to keep them mentally and morally sound than scores of lectures on\r\n    sex-hygiene.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Personal teaching approved.]\r\n\r\n    \"The world is wide, and a great deal is happening in it. I do not\r\n    plead for ignorance, but for the gradual and harmonious broadening\r\n    of the field of knowledge, and for a more careful consideration of\r\n    ways and means. There are subjects which may be taught in class,\r\n    and subjects which commend themselves to individual teaching.\r\n    There are topics which admit of _plein-air_ handling, and topics\r\n    which civilized man, as apart from his artless brother of the\r\n    jungles, has veiled with reticence. There are truths which may be,\r\n    and should be, privately imparted by a father, a mother, family\r\n    doctor, or an experienced teacher; but which young people cannot\r\n    advantageously acquire from the platform, the stage, the moving\r\n    picture gallery, the novel or the ubiquitous monthly magazine.\"\r\n\r\nThere is much in Miss Repplier's paragraphs which will win hearty\r\napproval from those who have come to believe, as advocated throughout\r\nthis series of lectures, in conservative teaching of sex-hygiene and a\r\nlarger outlook for sex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Current frankness not due to sex-education.]\r\n\r\nNo doubt there has been too great a loss of a certain kind of reticence\r\nand a substitution of crude frankness, but it has not been caused by\r\nthe sex-education movement. On the contrary, there are two evident\r\nsources of the plain speech of which Miss Repplier and others have\r\ncomplained: First, the commercializing of sex by novelists, dramatists,\r\ntheater managers, and publishers--many of whom are reaping a golden\r\nharvest and few of whom have any sincere interest in promulgating\r\nsexual information to any end except their own pocketbooks. Second, the\r\ndevelopment of the feminist movement which has its deepest foundation\r\nin the age-old sexual misunderstandings of women by men, and which has\r\nled on and on into social and political complications of gravest\r\nsignificance. The very nature of the feminist revolt from masculine\r\ndomination made plain speaking on sex matters inevitable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reaction against sensational frankness.]\r\n\r\nNeither of these sources of plain speech need give us cause for alarm,\r\nfor a great reaction is already coming. The sensationalism of sexual\r\nrevelations has had its day, and the intelligent public is recovering\r\nits balance. A lurid novel or play resembling \"Damaged Goods\" or \"The\r\nHouse of Bondage\" or certain vice-commission reports would not now be\r\naccepted by some prominent publishers who recently would not have\r\nhesitated to seize a first-class commercial opportunity in this line.\r\nThe fact is that sexual sensationalism has ceased to pay because the\r\nintelligent public knows the main facts and has become disgusted with\r\ncrude frankness that amounts to lasciviousness. On the side of feminism\r\nthere is hope in the widespread disgust with Cristabel Pankhurst's\r\n\"Plain Facts on a Great Evil\" as compared with the very general\r\napproval of Louise Creighton's polished masterpiece, \"The Social Evil\r\nand How to Fight It.\" This represents exactly the present attitude of\r\nnumerous men and women who calmly discuss together the great problems\r\nof life fearlessly and without any elements of lasciviousness such as\r\nsome people seem to think is necessarily associated with either\r\nunsexual or bisexual discussion of sex problems.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Not a typical case.]\r\n\r\nMiss Repplier's description of her own lack of youthful interest in\r\nthings sexual is of value simply as applied to a limited number of\r\nextra-protected girls. Her experience teaches us nothing regarding boys\r\nor even girls under average conditions. We know beyond any doubt that\r\naverage children in or near adolescence do seek the kind of information\r\nthat Miss Repplier denies having thought about. It is not \"pressed\r\nrelentlessly upon their attention\" by teachers, but by instinct and by\r\nenvironment. Playground and swimming pools and religious influence and\r\nwork are all helpful in our dealings with young people, but all\r\ntogether they are inadequate without some information concerning sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conclusion.]\r\n\r\nFinally, Miss Repplier, like so many other critics of sex-instruction,\r\nhas in mind only the physical consequences of wrong-doing. Here again\r\nis the influence of the pioneer sex-hygiene. However, she pleads for\r\nthe \"gradual and harmonious broadening of the field of knowledge and\r\nfor a more careful consideration of ways and means\" for\r\nsex-instruction. This makes us believe that she will favor the larger\r\nsex-education which gives a place to \"the cheerful recreation, the\r\nreligious teaching, the childish virtues, the youthful virtues, the\r\nwholesome preoccupation,\" as well as essential knowledge of physical\r\nfacts; and all as factors in preparing young people consciously and\r\nunconsciously to face the inevitable problems of sex. On the whole, we\r\nmust regard Miss Repplier's discussion as a helpful contribution to the\r\nsaner aspects of sex-education.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 45. _A Plea for Religious Approach to Sex-instruction_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cosmo Hamilton.]\r\n\r\nAnother prominent author who does not agree with the current tendencies\r\nof sex-instruction is Cosmo Hamilton in his little book entitled \"A\r\nPlea for the Younger Generation\" (Doran Co.). He agrees with the\r\nsex-education writers that children should be instructed early, and as\r\nfar as possible by their parents; but he wholly disagrees with the\r\nmethod of biological introduction. He would have parents go straight to\r\nthe heart of the matter and tell the child, as simply and truly as can\r\nbe, just how he came into the world. And he would fill the teaching\r\nwith reverence by using as an illustration the birth of the babe of\r\nBethlehem. Referring to those who in recent years have been working for\r\na scientific introduction to sex-education, Mr. Hamilton says:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Religious appeal.]\r\n\r\n    \"I think that these professors and scientists are wasting their\r\n    time, and I have written this small volume not only in order to\r\n    make a plea for the younger generation as to the way in which they\r\n    shall be taught sex truths, but also in order, if possible, to\r\n    prove to the advanced thinkers of the day that it is not\r\n    old-fashioned to beg that God may be put back into the lives of\r\n    His children, but a thing of urgent and vital importance. Without\r\n    faith the new generation is like a city built on sand. Without the\r\n    discipline and the inspiration of God the young boys and girls who\r\n    will all too soon be standing in our shoes will go through life\r\n    with hungry souls, with nothing to live up to, and very little to\r\n    live for.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Many not reached by religious appeal.]\r\n\r\nAll this is very good so far as it appeals to the religious type of\r\nmind, but Mr. Hamilton seems to forget that vast numbers of people\r\ncannot be approached from this point of view. How can the illustration\r\nof the Christ-child help those who do not accept certain orthodox\r\nreligious beliefs?\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46. _The Conflict between Sex-hygiene and Sex-ethics_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Richard Cabot.]\r\n\r\nIt has been said in an earlier lecture that several writers have\r\ndeclared that sex-ethics and sex-hygiene are essentially conflicting\r\nand should not be associated in teaching; that is to say, that hygienic\r\nfacts should not be taught with the hope of improving morals. Most\r\nprominent of those who have declared that hygienic and moral teaching\r\nshould be dissociated is Dr. Richard C. Cabot, of Boston. I shall give\r\nin this lecture attention to his writings because they have tended to\r\nintroduce confusion by critical attention to certain weak details and\r\nunessentials in the original suggestions for sex-education, and by\r\nwrongly assuming that the original \"sex-hygiene\" was aimed at improved\r\nmorals, whereas it was aimed directly at health. In a paper entitled\r\n\"Consecration of the Affections (often misnamed 'Sex-hygiene'),\" read\r\nat the fifth (1911) Congress of the American School Hygiene\r\nAssociation, Dr. Cabot attacked the kind of sex-instruction that is\r\nlimited to sex-hygiene. He has later returned to the attack on many\r\noccasions. I shall quote a number of his paragraphs and follow each\r\nwith a discussion of its contents.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hygiene and conduct.]\r\n\r\n    (1) \"The straight, right action in matters of human affection has\r\n    nothing to do with hygiene. For hygiene has no words to proclaim\r\n    as to why you and I should behave ourselves. Hygiene has the right\r\n    and the duty to make clear the perverted and the diseased\r\n    consequences of certain errors. But these consequences are far\r\n    from constant.... Let us disabuse our minds, then, of the idea\r\n    that there are always bad physical consequences of mistake, error,\r\n    or sin in this [sex] field, and that those consequences are\r\n    reasons for behaving ourselves. But even if there were such\r\n    consequences, I think it even more mischievous for us to preach a\r\n    morality based upon them.\"\r\n\r\nThat hygienic knowledge makes many people control their sexual selves\r\nis beyond dispute. Because the consequences of sexual error are far\r\nfrom constant is a weak argument against pointing out possible results.\r\nThe consequences from pistols are far from constant, and yet I have no\r\ndoubt that Dr. Cabot would teach small boys the danger of shooting\r\nthemselves and other people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hygiene and ethics for health.]\r\n\r\nThe last quoted sentence suggests Dr. Cabot's whole basis of contention\r\nagainst sex-hygiene. He seems to have inferred from the earlier papers,\r\nespecially those by Dr. Morrow, that the hygiene of sex is to be taught\r\nas an approach to morality. On the contrary, the truth is that the aim\r\nof most of the first leaders in sex-instruction was to teach hygiene\r\nand ethics primarily in order to improve health. Dr. Morrow and others\r\nbelieved that hygienic teaching would secondarily react on sexual\r\nmorality; but the original aim of the Society of Sanitary and Moral\r\nProphylaxis was to limit the spread of venereal disease by sanitary,\r\nmoral, and legal means. In other words, moral appeals were to aid in\r\nchecking disease, and knowledge of disease was not claimed to improve\r\nmorality, although such knowledge might react against immorality. It is\r\nthis misunderstanding or overlooking of the real reasons for teaching\r\nconcerning sex health that seems to have led Dr. Cabot into apparent\r\nopposition to the general movement for sex-instruction. One infers from\r\nall his lectures that he believes it good to teach hygiene for health,\r\nethics for morality, and biology for science; but that these should not\r\nbe correlated because to him they are unrelated. It seems to me that he\r\nhas simply been misled by the overenthusiasm of some of the first\r\nwriters on sex-hygiene and by the widespread use of that limited term\r\ninstead of sex-education.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Is sex-hygiene immoral?]\r\n\r\n    (2) \"Now I say that the preaching about sex-hygiene that is going\r\n    on in recent books and in the periodical press is immoral in its\r\n    tendency. It is like saying, 'Don't lie, for if you do, you won't\r\n    sleep at night, and insomnia is bad for the health.'\"\r\n\r\nIf insomnia often follows lying, then it should be taught as _one_\r\nreason why falsehoods should be avoided. This is not opposed to ethical\r\nteaching, for at the same time we can teach the other reasons for not\r\ntelling lies. Likewise, sex-hygiene offers certain reasons for conduct\r\nand may be supplemented by sex-ethics.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Information and morality.]\r\n\r\n    (3) \"The attempts to consecrate affection and to safeguard\r\n    morality by teaching in public or private schools what is called\r\n    'sex-hygiene' will, I believe, prove a failure. I have very\r\n    little confidence in the restraining or inspiring value of\r\n    information, as such. I have seen too much of its powerlessness in\r\n    medical men and students. No one knows so much of the harm of\r\n    morphine as the physicians do, yet there are more cases of\r\n    morphine habit among physicians than among any less informed\r\n    profession. It is, of course, easy to make young children familiar\r\n    with the facts of maternity and birth. Compared to the ordinary\r\n    methods of concealment and lying by parents to children about\r\n    these matters this is doubtless an improvement, but it does almost\r\n    nothing to meet the moral problems of sex which come up later in\r\n    the child's life. One may know all about maternity, without\r\n    knowing anything of the difficulties and dangers of sex. Many have\r\n    thought that by thorough teaching of the physiology of\r\n    reproduction in plants and animals we can anticipate and to a\r\n    considerable extent prevent the dangers and temptations referred\r\n    to above.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not proposed \"to consecrate affection\" or \"to safeguard morality\"\r\nby hygienic knowledge; but simply to protect health. Of course,\r\ninformation will not restrain everybody; but if physicians did not know\r\nthe dangers of morphine many more would be victims of the drug. Dr.\r\nCabot overlooks the fact that physicians know how to use and obtain\r\nmorphine, while other professional men do not. Teaching concerning\r\nmaternity and birth will not directly meet the moral problems of sex,\r\nbut it will help develop an attitude, \"a consecration of the\r\naffections,\" that will guard against the dangers of sex. Such teaching\r\nto children is only one of many steps in the scheme of sex-education.\r\nNo responsible advocate of sex-instruction claims that teaching\r\nchildren concerning the reproduction of animals and plants does\r\nanticipate and prevent sexual temptations; but it is a foundation for\r\npractical knowledge of human sex problems. I have elsewhere referred to\r\nthe effect of such studies on attitude.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Contagion of personality.]\r\n\r\n    (4) \"The positive moral qualities which make us immune to the\r\n    dangers of sex are obtainable not through warnings as to dangers,\r\n    but through the more positive activities just alluded to. All that\r\n    is most practical and successful in this field of endeavor may be\r\n    summarized as the _contagion of personality, human or divine_.\r\n    What is it that keeps any of us straight unless it is the\r\n    contagion of the highest personalities whom we have known, in man\r\n    and God?\"\r\n\r\nWe must admit that, perhaps, \"positive moral qualities\" are not\r\nobtainable through warnings, but in this pragmatic age we must have\r\ngood social results gained by any honorable means. Many people are kept\r\nfrom crime by warnings of the law. Of course, this is not a \"positive\r\nmoral\" result for the unethical individual who must be restrained by\r\nfear of legal consequences, but we do not worry about the individual\r\nwhen society gains. Likewise, a man kept from sexual promiscuity by\r\nfear of disease is not more positively moral, but he is a better member\r\nof society. No one will deny the importance of personality in its\r\ninfluence on positive moral qualities; but there are many people who\r\nare not influenced by personality, either human or divine. Other kinds\r\nof control, such as hygienic and legal, are necessary for such people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Good and evil.]\r\n\r\n    (5) \"A positive evil can be driven out only by a much more\r\n    positive good. The lower passion can be conquered only by a higher\r\n    passion.\"\r\n\r\nHere, again, Dr. Cabot seems to misunderstand the aim of hygienic\r\nteaching regarding sex. It is not expected \"to conquer the lower\r\npassion\" by hygiene, but to help keep it under control to the end that\r\npersonal and social health will be improved. The opium evil (certainly\r\na _positive_ one) is being driven out of China by military methods that\r\nare good only in their results in suppressing the drug. Likewise,\r\nhygiene of sex will be a practical good in so far as it may reduce the\r\nvenereal curse. \"Positive good\" in Dr. Cabot's moral sense is only of\r\nlimited application so far as the majority of people are concerned. In\r\nfact, the whole idea of solving the sexual problems by \"consecration of\r\nthe affections\" makes its strong appeal only to those who have already\r\ngrasped the higher view of sex and do not need sex-instruction. Other\r\npeople cannot understand the phrase. We must find some more direct and\r\npractical attack on the sex problems for the masses; and I believe that\r\nthis means scientific teaching which improves attitude, and hygienic\r\nteaching which protects personal and social health. It is worth while\r\nto get these results even if we do not succeed in improving morals.\r\nThat, I believe, is another and quite independent problem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissociation of hygienic and moral teaching.]\r\n\r\nIn an address published in the _Journal of the Society of Sanitary and\r\nMoral Prophylaxis_, Vol. V, No. 1, January 1914, Dr. Cabot contended\r\nthat the hygienic and moral aspects of sex-education should not be\r\nassociated. It is possible that the following review and criticisms may\r\nbe based upon a misinterpretation; but if so, I shall not feel lonely,\r\nfor at the close of the discussion, Dr. Cabot said to his audience, \"it\r\nis evident that I have not succeeded in touching even the surfaces of\r\nyour minds, and have not made an atom of impression in making the\r\ndistinction which I desired to make.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Cabot's main points are quoted below, and my comments follow each\r\nquotation.\r\n\r\n    (1) \"Sanitation can often be conveyed effectively by information,\r\n    but morality cannot be conveyed by telling things.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Teaching morals.]\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that sanitation can be taught by words. That words\r\nconcerning moral things have no value is a proposition which Dr. Cabot\r\ndid not clearly and convincingly support.\r\n\r\n    (2) \"People often make sanitary mistakes from ignorance. So far as\r\n    you are ignorant you cannot be immoral. Morality is conditioned\r\n    upon knowledge of the right and wrong in question.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Immoral or unmoral.]\r\n\r\nOf course, one who is ignorant is unmoral and not immoral, but this\r\ndoes not divorce sanitary and moral problems of social disease. An\r\nignorant and unmoral man may have unsanitary sexual habits, but\r\nenlighten him regarding venereal disease and his habits make him\r\nimmoral.\r\n\r\n    (3) \"I cannot see that biology has moral value.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Moral value of biology.]\r\n\r\nBut it may have moral influence just as literature and history and\r\nbiography may have. Of course, pure biology alone will not make people\r\nmore sexually moral, but no responsible biologist has ever claimed that\r\nit will.\r\n\r\n    (4) \"In morals, we are dealing with the will, and if we believe\r\n    that the will is guided by intelligence, we must believe that all\r\n    people who _know_ what is right will _do_ what is right.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Knowledge and will.]\r\n\r\nIt does not follow that to know what is right is to do what is right.\r\nAll depends upon the relative weight of opposing factors. A medical\r\nstudent may _know_ the facts regarding venereal disease; but he also\r\nknows the fact that his sexual instincts are insistent. The fact of his\r\npassion may be more weighty than his scientific knowledge; and his will\r\nmay be guided by intelligent choice based on comparison of the two\r\nopposing facts. Hence, it is illogical to contend that knowledge may\r\nnot influence moral conduct and that the will is not guided by\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cultivation of morality.]\r\n\r\n    (5) \"Any good achieved in any branch of morality helps all\r\n    morality. A person who learns any kind of self control is helped\r\n    toward all kinds. Anything that helps self control in one field\r\n    will help in all fields, the field of sex as well as others.\r\n    Whatever makes a person more obedient to conscience in matters of\r\n    truth or courage will help him in matters of chastity. We get\r\n    morality not by consciously cultivating particular virtues, but by\r\n    making ourselves useful men and women, by practice and by the love\r\n    and imitation of our betters. Thus, morality is cultivated in\r\n    hundreds of ways all at once.\"\r\n\r\nThis is sound, but it is in no logical way opposed to any other aspect\r\nof sex-instruction discussed in this series of lectures.\r\n\r\n    (6) \"Wherever the conditions of intimacy and interest\r\n    exist,--intimacy with the right person and interest in the right\r\n    thing,--moral training is going on.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Influence of individuals.]\r\n\r\nThis is Dr. Cabot's strongest point. He believes in the moral influence\r\nof individuals. So do all leading advocates of sex-instruction or of\r\nany other form of moral education. This is in no sense opposed to any\r\naccepted proposition of sex-education.\r\n\r\n    (7) \"Sanitation may increase immorality.... I do care more for\r\n    morality than for sanitation. Where the two conflict I want\r\n    morality to lead and to govern.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Morals rather than health.]\r\n\r\nRight here is the basis for Dr. Cabot's repeated attacks on the\r\nsex-education movement. He believes that morality and sanitation are\r\ndecidedly conflicting. His address fails to support this idea with\r\nregard to a single point concerned with the proposed sex-education. He\r\nmentioned only two points wherein there is apparent conflict, namely,\r\nprophylaxis that allows immorality while avoiding venereal disease, and\r\nprevention of conception. Neither of these is directly involved in the\r\nsex-education movement, and their immoral bearings are highly\r\ndebatable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethics of venereal antisepsis.]\r\n\r\nVenereal prophylactics may increase promiscuity of some unmoral and\r\nimmoral men, but if universally and scientifically used by such men,\r\nthere would be little or no infection of innocent women and children.\r\nTherefore, I assert that the good that would come from the use of\r\nprophylactics by those who do not recognize moral control would be far\r\nmore significant than the fact that venereal prophylactics might\r\nencourage immorality. Those who would use prophylactics would be no\r\nworse morally than they were before, but society would gain\r\nhygienically.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ethics of contraception.]\r\n\r\nRegarding the morality of prevention of fertilization, the best of\r\npeople hold opposing views. A great specialist in tuberculosis who\r\nentered the discussion of Dr. Cabot's paper convinced most of his\r\nhearers that hygienic prevention of fertilization of tubercular women\r\nis a very moral act for a physician to advise. The real question of\r\nmorality involved in the problem of contraconception is not whether it\r\nis immoral that sperm-cells should be prevented from swimming on\r\ntowards an egg-cell, but whether there is morality in a sexual union\r\nthat has its meaning only in affection and is not definitely intended\r\nfor propagation. It is obviously a complicated problem of hygiene,\r\npsychology, ethics, æsthetics, religious beliefs, social traditions,\r\nand personal prejudice; and it is absurd to allow it to become\r\nentangled in the general propositions of sex-education. As I have often\r\nsaid in this series of lectures, the larger sex-education aims at\r\nmaking the best possible adjustments of sex and life. If the æsthetic\r\ndemands of affection are in real conflict with the animal function of\r\npropagation, then a pragmatically ethical solution is found in\r\nintelligent control of the original function. Ideally, the animal\r\nfunction of propagation should be associated with the possibilities of\r\naffection that have developed in the highest human life; but there are\r\nnumerous cases in which there must be dissociation of the functions of\r\naffection and propagation, or the alternative is sexual asceticism.\r\nWhich is moral? This is a question concerning which the individual must\r\nweigh his personal views and decide. Only the bigoted victims of\r\narrogance will see immorality in the one who disagrees with him on this\r\nquestion. I insist, then, that even if advanced sex-education for\r\nadults should some day come to involve the problem of contraconception,\r\nthere will be no conflict between hygienic knowledge and ethics, if the\r\nteaching leads to more perfect adjustment of sex and life.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Neumann's view.]\r\n\r\nProbably the great majority of workers in the sex-education movement do\r\nnot in the least agree with Dr. Cabot's attempts to dissociate hygienic\r\nand moral problems. A far more helpful view is that expressed by Dr.\r\nHenry Neumann, leader of the Brooklyn Ethical Culture Society:\r\n\r\n    \"Problems of hygiene, whether of sex, or nutrition, or temperance\r\n    and the like, are no less moral problems. They are problems of\r\n    habit; and habits are impossible without strong incentives to\r\n    start them and keep them going.... Ethical instruction is often\r\n    misunderstood to be barren preaching. It is nothing of the sort.\r\n    It consists in clarifying views of life. It begins with the fact\r\n    that there are certain tendencies in our nature which may work ill\r\n    or good. Then it tries to show to what these lead. It uses what is\r\n    best in us to make over what is worst. That is why problems of\r\n    sex-hygiene should be regarded as at bottom problems of\r\n    sex-morality.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 47. _The Arrogance of the Advocates of Sex-education_\r\n\r\nIn an article in the _Educational Review_, February, 1914,\r\nSuperintendent Maxwell, of New York City, writes concerning what he\r\ncalls \"the teaching of child hygiene\" as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Maxwell's criticisms.]\r\n\r\n    \"There are those to-day who claim that sexual information and\r\n    problems should be thrust upon the attention of boys and girls by\r\n    the teachers in the public schools, that this teaching is\r\n    necessary for the protection of virtue and the prevention of\r\n    disease, and that, if anyone hesitates to encourage the spread of\r\n    such literature and the teaching of such knowledge, he is an\r\n    arrant and presumptuous blockhead. The arrogance of the extreme\r\n    advocates of child hygiene blinds them to certain all-important\r\n    truths. The first is that our teachers are not prepared, and, in\r\n    too many cases, are not the most suitable persons to teach the\r\n    subject. The second is that to bring the adolescent mind face to\r\n    face with sexual matters engenders the habit of dwelling upon the\r\n    sexual passion, and in that may lie spiritual havoc and physical\r\n    ruin. A premature interest in the sexual passion debases the mind\r\n    and unsettles the will. The third is that parents have no right to\r\n    ask the teacher to do the work that is peculiarly theirs.\r\n\r\n    \"And yet some good may emerge from this discussion. Parents may be\r\n    incited to do their duty in placing sex information before their\r\n    children whenever conditions demand such knowledge. And principals\r\n    and teachers, particularly principals, whenever they have the\r\n    acuteness to detect the tendency to wrong-doing, will no longer\r\n    hesitate to utter the word of warning in season. As for the\r\n    extravagant claims made for the teaching of sex-hygiene, I have\r\n    too much faith in the good sense of the American people to believe\r\n    that it will ever be generally and regularly taught in American\r\n    schools. Surely, we have learned something since the law compelled\r\n    us to teach the untruths regarding the effects of stimulants and\r\n    narcotics that were published in the early school manuals of\r\n    physiology and hygiene.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Reply to Dr. Maxwell.]\r\n\r\nI comment as follows: (1) Dr. Maxwell refers only to the \"extreme\r\nadvocates.\" They did exist in abundance a few years ago, but are\r\nalready rare in the group of well-known educators. (2) Most teachers\r\nare not prepared and never can be prepared to teach the human aspect of\r\nsex problems, especially the hygienic in the strict sense. (3)\r\nConservative sex-instruction such as was advocated by the advisers of\r\nthe American Federation for Sex-hygiene (see \"Report\" by Morrow and\r\nothers, 1913) aims to guard against \"premature interest in the sexual\r\npassion.\" (4) While I sympathize with Dr. Maxwell's view that teaching\r\nthe elementary hygiene of sex is the parent's duty, I am forced to\r\nrecognize the futility of advocating that all or even a respectable\r\nminority of parents should undertake their duty (see § 4). The truth is\r\nthat most of them will not, and cannot if they will, try to do so. (5)\r\nDr. Maxwell's idea that sex-hygiene should be taught only when an\r\nastute principal or parent \"detects wrong-doing\" is, to say the least,\r\nan educational theory that will astonish one who knows even the\r\nelementary facts regarding the secrecy of the sexual life of young\r\npeople in general. Will he next be logically consistent and advocate\r\nthat all moral education should be given only after children show signs\r\nof wrong-doing? (6) Sex-hygiene, as Dr. Maxwell understands it to be\r\nconcerned directly and solely with human sexual problems, will never be\r\ntaught in American schools controlled by people of good sense; but\r\nsex-instruction from the larger viewpoint is taught in some of the best\r\nof Dr. Maxwell's high schools. (7) All advocates of sex-instruction who\r\nhave a national reputation for educational sanity agree that\r\nlegislation is most undesirable. (8) It is obvious that like so many\r\nothers who have become confused regarding the sex-education movement,\r\nDr. Maxwell has been impressed chiefly by the pioneer work that\r\nemphasized only hygienic teaching regarding sex.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 48. _Lubricity in Education_\r\n\r\nEx-President Taft has expressed his views against the sex-education\r\nmovement. The newspapers quote as follows from an address delivered in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1914:\r\n\r\n    \"There is another danger in our educational influences and\r\n    environment. I refer to the spread of lubricity in literature, on\r\n    the stage and indirectly in education, under the plea that vice\r\n    may be avoided by teaching the awful consequences. By dwelling on\r\n    its details and explaining its penalties, sexual subjects are\r\n    obtruded into discussion between the sexes, lectures are delivered\r\n    on them, textbooks are written, and former restraints of modesty\r\n    are abandoned.\r\n\r\n    [Sidenote: Mr. Taft's alarm.]\r\n\r\n    \"The pursuit of education in sex-hygiene is full of danger if\r\n    carried on in general public schools. The sharp, pointed and\r\n    summary advice of mothers to daughters, of fathers to sons, of a\r\n    medical professor to students in a college upon such a subject is,\r\n    of course, wise, but any benefit that may be derived from\r\n    frightening students by dwelling upon the details of the dreadful\r\n    punishment of vice is too often offset by awakening a curiosity\r\n    and interest that might not be developed so early and is likely to\r\n    set the thoughts of those whose benefit is at stake in a direction\r\n    that will neither elevate their conversations with their fellows\r\n    nor make more clean their mental habit.\r\n\r\n    \"I deny that the so-called prudishness and the avoidance of nasty\r\n    subjects in the last generation has ever blinded any substantial\r\n    number of girls or boys to the wickedness of vice or made them\r\n    easier victims of temptations.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evident misunderstanding.]\r\n\r\nThe above requires little comment, for its misunderstandings are\r\nobvious to one who has followed the sex-education movement. Clearly Mr.\r\nTaft has been impressed by the social-hygiene side of the problems and\r\ndoes not realize the existence of a larger outlook for sex-education.\r\nLike so many other writers who seem to know little concerning the\r\nsexual life of children, especially of boys, Mr. Taft fears \"the\r\nawakening of curiosity and interest\"! This, of course, depends upon the\r\nfacts taught and the age of the learner, but it hardly applies to\r\nchildren in or near adolescence who are taught along the lines\r\nsuggested by the committee of the American Federation for Sex-Hygiene\r\n(1913). The last paragraph quoted from Mr. Taft will be denied\r\ncompletely by all who are familiar with the problems of adolescent\r\neducation. To say the least, it is unfortunate that a man prominent in\r\nlaw and statesmanship should have lent the weight of his name to such\r\nsuperficial conclusions that are so obviously based on exceedingly\r\nlimited information regarding both the established facts of sex and the\r\nmost approved methods of sex-instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 49. _Conclusions from the Criticisms of Sex-education_\r\n\r\nI have selected for discussion the criticisms of several of the most\r\nprominent people who have expressed opposition to the sex-education\r\nmovement. I think that all the important lines of arguments against the\r\nmovement are represented in the extracts that I have quoted. We have\r\nseen that all of the criticisms have decidedly vulnerable points. Most\r\nof them refer to the discarded sex-hygiene of ten years ago; but some\r\nof them prove that the authors are quite ignorant of the sex problems\r\nthat must be faced by numerous young people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Criticisms important.]\r\n\r\nWith the hope of locating the weaknesses of sex-education, I have for\r\nyears examined carefully every criticism published, and it seems to me\r\nthoroughly scientific to conclude that all the important criticisms\r\nhave not harmed the essentials of the sex-education movement; but, on\r\nthe contrary, have been helpful in forcing reconstruction. In fact, the\r\npresent-day conception of the larger sex-education must be credited to\r\nthe severe critics more than to the friends of the original narrow\r\nmovement for reducing venereal disease by hygienic instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nTHE PAST AND THE FUTURE OF THE SEX-EDUCATION MOVEMENT\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 50. _The American Movement_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dr. Morrow leader in America.]\r\n\r\nIn America the movement for sex-education began with the organization\r\nof the American Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis on February\r\n9, 1905, under the leadership of Dr. Prince A. Morrow. It is true that\r\nbefore this time there were various local and sporadic attempts at\r\ninstruction concerning sexual processes, but such teaching was chiefly\r\npersonal and there was no concerted movement looking towards making\r\nsex-instruction an integral part of general education. In 1892,\r\nthirteen years before the organization of the Society of Sanitary and\r\nMoral Prophylaxis, a group of members of the National Education\r\nAssociation considered briefly the importance of instructing young\r\npeople. However, this meeting was of ephemeral significance and had no\r\ngenetic relation to the present-day movement. Other early interest in\r\nsex-instruction is indicated in Professor Earl Barnes's bibliography\r\nwhich was published in his \"Studies in Education,\" Vol. I, p. 301,\r\n1897.\r\n\r\nThe educational activities, especially the publications of the American\r\nSociety of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, soon attracted the serious\r\nattention of numerous physicians, ministers, and educators in various\r\nparts of the United States; and about twenty other societies for study\r\nand improvement of the sex problems were organized within a few years\r\nafter the original society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Original aim for sanitary ends.]\r\n\r\nThe sex-education movement both in Europe and America had its origin as\r\nan attempt to check the spread of the venereal or social diseases. The\r\nidea that education should work for sexual morality for its own sake\r\nand not simply for protection against venereal diseases has only\r\nrecently begun to appear in the literature of sex-education, and so far\r\nit seems to have made only a limited impression on many of those who\r\nhave been active in the prophylactic campaign against social disease.\r\nIn fact, the tardy recognition of the moral aim of sex-education makes\r\nit seem probable that very little interest would have been aroused in\r\nthe movement if it had been organized on purely ethical grounds and\r\nwithout any reference to the sanitary problems of social diseases. To\r\none who looks at sexual morality as a question of right conduct which\r\nbrings its own rewards, it is a shock to find so many thinking people\r\nwho accept calmly the traditional views of the relation of the sexes\r\nand seem to take no interest in the immorality of men except as it is\r\nlikely to lead to venereal disease or to illegitimacy which demands\r\nforced marriage or monetary payments. The truth is that the civilized\r\nworld at large is very far from a working code of sexual morals which\r\nwill be practiced because of promised rewards rather than because of\r\nprobable punishments. It is natural, then, that the sex-education\r\nmovement should have started with a proclamation of physical\r\npunishments for immorality rather than an offer of ethical and\r\npsychical rewards for morality.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Both sanitary and moral.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the fact that sex-education, under the name of \"sex-hygiene,\"\r\nwas at first a sanitary propagandism need not interfere with the larger\r\ndevelopment of sex-education. It now seems probable that before many\r\nyears pass we shall learn how to make a satisfactory combination of\r\nboth the sanitary and moral sides of sex-education, and so it is best\r\nthat the educational movement started on the foundation of the\r\nundisputed facts of sanitary science which have made a powerful\r\nimpression on the people who do and who do not recognize a code of\r\nsexual morals.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Medical interest.]\r\n\r\nThe deep interest of the medical profession is directly responsible for\r\nthe close association between the beginning of the sex-education\r\nmovement and the diseases of immorality. At the organization meeting of\r\nthe American Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis, Dr. Prince\r\nMorrow in the opening paragraph of his address said: \"We have met for\r\nthe purpose of discussing the wisdom and the expediency of forming a\r\nsociety of sanitary and moral prophylaxis. The object is to organize a\r\nsocial defense against a class of diseases which are most injurious to\r\nthe highest interests of human society.\" Thus, the American Society of\r\nSanitary and Moral Prophylaxis started as an avowed enemy of the social\r\ndiseases and so it has continued to the present. The very name of its\r\nofficial journal, _Social Diseases_,[19] indicated the central idea of\r\nthe Society. Likewise, most of the local American societies for\r\nsex-hygiene have names including such phrases as \"social hygiene,\"\r\n\"prevention of social diseases,\" \"sanitary prophylaxis\"; and only one,\r\nthe Massachusetts Society for Sex Education, has a name which does not\r\ndirectly suggest the medical problems of sex.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In Europe.]\r\n\r\nIn Europe, the sex-instruction movement has been concerned chiefly with\r\nspreading information concerning the social diseases. In 1902 an\r\ninternational congress for consideration of the venereal diseases was\r\nheld in Brussels, and this congress recommended that in all countries\r\nthere should be organized sanitary, social, moral, and legal societies\r\nfor the prophylaxis of these diseases. As a result of this\r\nrecommendation, prophylactic societies were formed in France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Holland, the United States, and other countries. Of these, the\r\nGerman society for the prevention of venereal disease became the\r\nstrongest, with over five thousand members and twenty branch\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: National societies.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the American Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis\r\nwas organized by a group of people in New York City tended from the\r\nbeginning to make it a local society. While for several years it took\r\nthe lead in sex-hygiene and enrolled members residing in many parts of\r\nthe United States, it was never a national organization. In recent\r\nyears the word \"American\" has been omitted from its name, and its work\r\nhas been limited to New York City and vicinity.[20] Many independent\r\nstate and city societies were organized within a few years after the\r\noriginal sex-hygiene society in New York. This multiplication of\r\nsocieties called attention to the need of a national organization, and\r\nin 1910 the various societies were affiliated in the American\r\nFederation for Sex-Hygiene. Dr. Morrow was the leading spirit in the\r\nFederation until his death. In 1913, the Federation and the American\r\nVigilance Association (a society especially concerned with the social\r\nevil) were united in the American Social Hygiene Association. Its\r\noffices are at 105 West 40th Street, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 51. _Important Steps in the Sex-education Movement in America_\r\n\r\n    May 23, 1904.

The National Education Association, at Minneapolis,\r\n    adopted the following resolutions in line with the latest\r\n    principles of the Society of Sanitary and Moral Prophylaxis and\r\n    the American Social Hygiene Association:\r\n\r\n      \"The Association, re-affirming its belief in the constructive\r\n      value of education in sex-hygiene, directs attention to the\r\n      grave dangers, ethical and social, arising out of a sex\r\n      consciousness stimulated by undue emphasis upon sex problems\r\n      and relations. The situation is so serious as to render\r\n      neglect hazardous. The Association urges upon all parents the\r\n      obvious duty of parental care and instruction in such matters\r\n      and directs attention to the mistake of leaving such problems\r\n      exclusively to the school. The Association believes that\r\n      sex-hygiene should be approached in the public schools\r\n      conservatively under the direction of persons qualified by\r\n      scientific training and teaching experience in order to\r\n      assure a safe moral point of view. The Association,\r\n      therefore, recommends that institutions preparing teachers\r\n      give attention to such subjects as would qualify for\r\n      instruction in the general field of morals as well as in the\r\n      particular field of sex-hygiene.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 52. _The Future of the Larger Sex-education_\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public has lost interest in sensationalism.]\r\n\r\nI hear many questions as to the probable future of sex-education. I am\r\nasked: \"Is it moribund?\" \"Is it a disappearing fad?\" \"Has not the high\r\ntide of interest passed?\" No doubt such questions are inspired by the\r\noft-repeated statement that public interest in sexual questions has\r\nwaned decidedly in the last few years. This is true, and it is a most\r\nfortunate indication of approaching sanity. The public interest in the\r\nlast decade has been most deplorable, because it has centered in the\r\nabnormal and sensational aspects of sex. Authors have vied with each\r\nother in presenting the most lurid cases of social diseases, white\r\nslavery, sexual perversions, and every other available aspect of sexual\r\ndegeneracy. Of course, the reading public was bound to grow tired of\r\nthis, just as it wearies of a horrible murder trial or of a\r\nsensational divorce case. It is certainly true that there is a marked\r\ndecline of general interest in sexual abnormality and sensationalism;\r\nbut that does not mean that the sex-education movement is moribund.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-education permanent.]\r\n\r\nThe wave of sensational revelation has passed; but the intelligent\r\npublic is no longer ignorant of the nature and causes of the great\r\nproblems of sex, and is well aware that young people need definite\r\nguidance for facing the facts of life. It is unthinkable that\r\nintelligent parents who are now well informed concerning sex will ever\r\nagain stand for the old policy of mystery and silence. It is,\r\ntherefore, impossible to believe that there is any danger of\r\nsex-education disappearing. Of course, we have not reached a permanent\r\nsystem of sex-education. There certainly will be vast changes in our\r\napproved subject matter and methods of teaching; but the main idea of\r\nthe sex-education movement is gaining support every day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-education fundamental.]\r\n\r\nThere is another reason why sex-education will be permanent. In\r\naddition to the great need of educational help with information and\r\ninfluence which will mold the individual life with regard to the\r\nproblems of sex, it must be evident to all that even the legislative,\r\nsanitary, social administrative, religious, ethical, and other attacks\r\nupon the problems depend upon knowledge and attitude, at least of the\r\nleaders. Look at the problems of sex outlined in the earlier lectures\r\nfrom whatever angle we will, and it appears that, in the final\r\nanalysis, education offers the only key to a possible solution.\r\nTherefore, I assert that sex-education--the larger sex-education--is an\r\nabsolutely fundamental factor in every phase of the social-hygiene and\r\nsex-ethical movement.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Ultimate effect of sex-education.]\r\n\r\nIn closing the last lecture of this series, let me state my confession\r\nof faith in sex-education: It is certainly only _one of several_\r\npossible lines of attack on the alarming sex problems of our time; but\r\nit offers the most hopeful outlook towards improved sexual morals and\r\nhealth, both physical and psychical. However, we shall gain nothing of\r\npermanent value by extravagant claims or hopes as to the ultimate\r\neffect of sex-education. We must expect incomplete results. It will not\r\nentirely solve the sex problems for all individuals who receive\r\ninstruction; but it will solve all of the problems of many individuals\r\nand help many others. It will not eradicate the social evil and its\r\ncharacteristic diseases, but it will protect many young people and so\r\nreduce the sum total of awful consequences. It will not prevent all\r\ndivorces and matrimonial disharmonies, but already the biological\r\nteaching is helping and some day the social-ethical problems will be\r\nunderstood and then most intelligent men and women will understand the\r\nfundamental principles for permanent and harmonious monogamic marriage.\r\nFinally, sex-education will not enforce universal sexual morality in\r\nconformity with our accepted code, but it will help many individuals\r\nthrough decisive battles with sex-instincts.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sex-Education and general education.]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the lines along which extreme claims and hopes for\r\nsex-education have been and are still being made. There is some truth\r\nin each; in fact, there is more than enough to justify the present\r\nmovement for sex-education. To all those who see nothing in the\r\nmovement because it will not solve all the sex problems which have\r\ncreated a demand for special instruction, we may reply by simply\r\npointing to the fact that general education makes some better and more\r\nefficient citizens, but many times it fails to give desirable results.\r\nWe believe in general education because it aims to offer all\r\nindividuals help in preparation for more efficient life, although it\r\nsucceeds only in part. Likewise, we should stand for the instruction of\r\nall young people in matters concerning sex because it is certain that\r\nsuch knowledge will function completely in many lives and will work\r\nappreciable good in many others.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A permanent and essential part of education.]\r\n\r\nI cannot believe that sex-education is one of the long line of modern\r\neducational fads which quickly pass their day, for no other phase of\r\neducation so closely touches life. History and geography and even a\r\nlarge part of the \"three Rs\" may be of little use in the lives of\r\nnumerous people, but sex-education deals with problems which the normal\r\nhuman life cannot possibly avoid and which each individual must be\r\nprepared to solve for himself. Therefore, we may confidently assert\r\nthat instruction concerning the most important aspects of sex processes\r\nand relationships will soon be recognized as an absolutely necessary\r\npart of a rational and efficient scheme for the education of young\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The never-ending problem of good and evil.]\r\n\r\nThe larger sex-education is sure to have a permanent place in the\r\nnever-ending work of preparing coming generations for the highest\r\ndevelopment of life's possibilities. Each succeeding generation of\r\nyoung people must be prepared by educational processes to face\r\nintelligently and bravely the problems of sex that are sure to come\r\ninto every normal life. Of course, sex-education at its best\r\ndevelopment can do no more than give the individual a basis for\r\nintelligent choice between good and evil; but here, as in all other\r\nupward movements of human life, the decision must depend upon a clear\r\nand positive recognition of the advantages of the good as contrasted\r\nwith the evil. Hence, the one essential task of sex-education in its\r\nbroadest outlook is to guide natural human beings to recognition and\r\nchoice of the best in the sexual sphere of life. And in so far as each\r\ncoming generation of individuals may be thus guided by the larger\r\nsex-education, the problems of sex will be pragmatically solved, for\r\nthe social aggregate of human life will become better, happier, nobler,\r\ntruer, more in harmony with the highest ideals of life, more like our\r\nvision of perfected humanity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The name was changed in 1913 to _Journal of the Society of\r\nSanitary and Moral Prophylaxis_.\r\n\r\n[20] While this book was in press, the name was changed to New York\r\nSocial Hygiene Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nSOME BOOKS FOR SEX-EDUCATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have decided to publish only the names of selected books which seem\r\nto me to be the best for teachers, parents, and young people. In making\r\nthe selection, I have considered several hundred books which bear on\r\nthe sex problems in an educational way, and have decided to reject the\r\nmajority of them. While there might be some value in a long list with\r\ncritical notes on books that I cannot recommend, it would be a worse\r\nthan thankless task to compile such an annotated bibliography; for the\r\ncompiler would surely add to his collection of enemies many authors\r\nwhose books deserve severe criticism. The sudden and sensational\r\npublicity concerning matters of sex and the possibility of commercial\r\nexploitation has produced an avalanche of sex books, some good, many\r\nbad, and the majority ordinary. Evidently, most of the authors,\r\nincluding numerous physicians, have written to order and without\r\nspecial preparation.\r\n\r\nThe books of the following lists are not all deserving of unqualified\r\nrecommendation. In fact, some of them are included because they are the\r\nleast objectionable of their much-needed kind, and others because they\r\nhave some good grains that the reader will find worth picking from a\r\nmass of non-nutritious but, fortunately, non-poisonous chaff.\r\n\r\nI have not included many books which I recognize as important for\r\nreaders thoroughly trained in science, but which are dangerous for the\r\naverage reader of literature on sex.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that I may have overlooked some very good books that I\r\nhave not intended to ignore; and I shall be glad to have my attention\r\ncalled to books which deserve recognition.\r\n\r\nSpecial bibliographies have been published in Wile's \"Sex-Education,\"\r\nMarch's \"Towards Racial Health,\" Geddes and Thomson's \"Sex,\" and\r\nFoster's \"Social Emergency.\"\r\n\r\nPublishers.--In most cases the first part of the names of well-known\r\npublishers has been given.
