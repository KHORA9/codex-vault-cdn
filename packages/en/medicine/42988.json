Parker, PhD, RN, Professor of Nursing Florida Atlantic\r\nUniversity, Boca Raton, Florida\r\n\r\nCaring may be one of the most often used words in the English language.\r\nIndeed, the word is commonly used as much in talking about our everyday\r\nlives and relationships as it is in the marketplace. At the same time,\r\nnurses thinking about, doing, and describing nursing know that caring\r\nhas unique and particular meaning to them. Caring is one of the first\r\nsynonyms for nursing offered by nursing students and is surely the most\r\nfrequent word used by the public in talking about nursing. Caring is an\r\nessential value in the personal and professional lives of nurses. The\r\nformal recognition of caring in nursing as an area of study and as a\r\nnecessary guide for the various avenues of nursing practice, however,\r\nis relatively new. Anne Boykin and Savina Schoenhofer have received\r\nmany requests from academic peers and students to articulate the nursing\r\ntheory they have been working to develop. This book is a response to\r\nthe call for a theory of nursing as caring. The progression of nursing\r\ntheory development often has been led by nurse theorists who stepped\r\ninto other disciplines for ways to think about and study nursing and for\r\nstructures and concepts to describe nursing practice. The opportunity to\r\nuse language and methods of familiar, relatively established bodies of\r\nknowledge that could be communicated and widely understood took shape as\r\nmany nursing scholars received graduate education in disciplines outside\r\nof nursing. Conceptions and methods of knowledge development often came\r\nthen from disciplines in the biological and social sciences and were\r\nbrought into ways of thinking about and doing nursing scholarship.\r\nEvolution of new worldviews opened the way for nurses to develop\r\ntheories reflecting ideas of energy fields, wholeness, processes, and\r\npatterns. Working from outside the discipline of nursing, along with\r\nshifts in worldviews, has been essential to opening the way for nurses\r\nto explore nursing as a unique practice and body of knowledge from\r\ninside the discipline, and to know nursing in unprecedented ways.\r\n\r\nNursing as Caring: A Model for Transforming Practice sets forth a\r\ndifferent order of nursing theory. This nursing theory is personal, not\r\nabstract. In order to express nursing as caring there is a clear need to\r\nknow self as caring person. The focus of the Nursing as Caring theory,\r\nthen, is not toward an end product such as health or wellness. It is\r\nabout a unique way of living caring in the world. It is about nurses and\r\nnursed living life and nurturing growing humanly through participation\r\nin life together.\r\n\r\nNursing as caring sets forth nursing as a unique way of living caring in\r\nthe world. This theory provides a view that can be lived in all nursing\r\nsituations and can be practiced alone or in combination with other\r\ntheories. The domain of nursing is nurturing caring. The integrity, the\r\nwholeness, and the connectedness of the person simply and assuredly is\r\ncentral. As such, this is perhaps the most basic, bedrock, and therefore\r\nradical, of nursing theories and is essential to all that is truly\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nThe dynamic, living idea of nursing as caring must be expressed\r\nknowledgeably. Perhaps for this reason, the book presents the essence of\r\nthe idea and encourages its careful study and understanding in full hope\r\nfor further development. In this regard, many questions come to mind\r\nin thinking about this work and its importance for the discipline and\r\npractice of nursing.\r\n\r\n  * What distinguishes this nursing theory from others?\r\n  * In what ways does this work add to the body of nursing knowledge?\r\n  * In what new and distinct ways are we to view theories of our discipline and practice?\r\n  * What are new descriptions of processes for development, study, and appraisal of nursing theories?\r\n  * How will new relationships among nursing theories be discovered and described?\r\n\r\nAs earlier theorists brought words and ways of other bodies of knowledge\r\nto help nurses know and articulate nursing, so some of the language of\r\nthis new theory has been drawn from philosophy. Generally, the language\r\nused to express the theory of nursing as caring is everyday language.\r\nThis model is a clear assertion of and for nursing--it distinguishes\r\nnursing knowledge, questions, and methods from those of other\r\ndisciplines. It helps us explore ways to use nursing knowledge and\r\nknowledge of other disciplines in ways appropriate to nursing. This\r\nvolume offers rich illustrations of nursing that will immediately seem\r\nfamiliar to most nurses. Many nurses will come to know new possibilities\r\nfor nursing practice, teaching, administration, and inquiry more fully.\r\n\r\nIn trying to open the door of this book and invite the reader to explore\r\nthe Nursing as Caring model, I am personally aware that the living of\r\nnursing and the commitment nursing calls forth cannot be fully measured.\r\nEach of us is part of the ongoing creation of nursing as we share our\r\nexperience of nursing. These attempts to share our nursing are a major\r\npart of the development of nursing as a discipline and professional\r\npractice. Our expressions about nursing are continually challenged as\r\npart of the creating process.\r\n\r\nThe processes of theory development have been the ongoing gift of many\r\nnursing scholars, theorists, and researchers. In expressing this new\r\ntheory of Nursing as Caring, nurses have again courageously stepped\r\nforward to develop, articulate, and publish ideas that seem very new to\r\nmany, and in doing so have risked to offer opportunity for a full range\r\nof responses to this work. I know Anne Boykin and Savina Schoenhofer\r\ninvite with great anticipation responses from nurses and will appreciate\r\nopportunity for dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Button]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n'The ideas which led to the development of theory of Nursing as Caring\r\nhave their beginnings in our personal histories and came together when\r\nwe met in 1983. As we participated in the work of establishing nursing\r\nas an academic discipline and creating a nursing curriculum grounded in\r\ncaring at Florida Atlantic University, each of us learned to value the\r\nspecial insights brought by the other. We also discovered early on that\r\nwe shared a deep devotion to nursing--to the idea of nursing, to the\r\npractice of nursing, to the development of nursing.\r\n\r\nSeveral years ago, we realized that our thinking had developed to the\r\nextent that we were working with more than a concept. Although we\r\nare well aware of an ongoing debate in nursing over technical versus\r\nphilosophical connotations of theory, we characterize our work as a\r\ngeneral theory of nursing developed in the context of our understanding\r\nof human science. While we are familiar with the formal concept of\r\ntheory used in disciplines grouped in the physical and natural sciences,\r\nwe believe that mathematical form is not an appropriate model for theory\r\nwork in the discipline of nursing. Therefore, we do not present our\r\nwork in the traditional form of concepts, definitions, statements, and\r\npropositions, but have struggled to find ways to preserve the integrity\r\nof nursing as caring through our expressions.\r\n\r\nOur thinking has been particularly influenced by the work of two\r\nscholars, Mayeroff and Roach. Both of these authors have given voice to\r\ncaring in important ways--Mayeroff in terms of generic caring, and Roach\r\nin terms of caring person as well as caring in nursing. We are aware of\r\nother influences on our understanding of caring and caring in nursing,\r\nincluding Paterson and Zderad, Watson, Ray, Leininger, and Gaut. Our\r\nconception of nursing as a discipline has been directly influenced by\r\nPhenix, King and Brownell, and the Nursing Development Conference\r\nGroup. While this is not an exhaustive listing of the scholars who have\r\ncontributed to the development of our ideas, we have made a deliberate\r\neffort to review the evolution of our thinking and to recognize\r\nsignificant specific contributions.\r\n\r\nChapter 1 presents a discussion of key ideas that ground and\r\ncontextualize nursing as caring. The most fundamental idea is that\r\nof person as caring with nursing conceptualized as a discipline. Our\r\nunderstanding of this foundation has been seasoned both from within\r\nnursing and from outside the discipline, but always with the purpose of\r\ndeepening our understanding of nursing. When we have gone outside the\r\ndiscipline to extend possibilities for understanding, we have made an\r\neffort to go beyond application, to think through the nursing relevance\r\nof ideas that seemed, on the surface, to be useful. Chapter I and\r\nsubsequent chapters draw on Mayeroff's (1971) caring ingredients,\r\nincluding:\r\n\r\n* Knowing--Explicitly and implicitly, knowing that and knowing how,\r\nknowing directly, and knowing indirectly (p. 14).\r\n\r\n* Alternating rhythm--Moving back and forth between a narrower and a\r\nwider framework, between action and reflection (p. 15).\r\n\r\n* Patience--Not a passive waiting but participating with the other,\r\ngiving fully of ourselves (p. 17).\r\n\r\n* Honesty--Positive concept that implies openness, genuineness, and\r\nseeing truly (p. 18).\r\n\r\n* Trust--Trusting the other to grow in his or her own time and own way\r\n(p. 20).\r\n\r\n* Humility--Ready and willing to learn more about other and self and what\r\ncaring involves (p, 23).\r\n\r\n* Hope--\"An expression of the plentitude of the present, alive with a\r\nsense of a possible\" (p. 26).\r\n\r\n* Courage--Taking risks, going into the unknown, trusting (p. 27).\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 2, we present the theory in its most general form. We have\r\nresisted the temptation to include examples in this chapter for two\r\nreasons: first, because an example always seemed to lead to the need to\r\nfurther explain and illustrate; and second, because we wished to have\r\na general expression of the theory, undelimited by particulars, and\r\navailable to facilitate further theory development.\r\n\r\nChapter 3 elaborates on the idea of the nursing situation, and\r\nillustrates the practical meaning of the theory in a range of particular\r\nnursing situations. This chapter will probably be most satisfying to\r\nthe reader whose everyday nursing discourse is that of nursing practice.\r\nSome might find it useful to read this chapter first, before reading\r\nChapters 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 4, we explore the practice of nursing as caring and discuss\r\nnursing service administration from the perspective of the theory.\r\nChapter 5 addresses issues and strategies for transforming nursing\r\neducation and nursing education administration based on nursing as\r\ncaring.\r\n\r\nOur understanding of nursing as a human science discipline is the\r\ncentral focus of Chapter 6. In this chapter, we discuss the necessity\r\nof transforming models of nursing inquiry to facilitate the further\r\ndevelopment of nursing knowledge in the context of the theory of Nursing\r\nas Caring. We also share our commitment to the ongoing development\r\nof nursing as caring and directions we wish to take in living that\r\ncommitment.\r\n\r\nIt has been our intention to organize and communicate the initial,\r\ncomprehensive presentation of Nursing as Caring usefully for nurses in\r\npractice, as well as those in administrative and academic roles. We\r\nhave benefited wonderfully from the dialogue resulting from formal and\r\ninformal opportunities to share this work as it evolved. We look forward\r\nto continuing this dialogue.

Growth by extension\r\nconsists of a relatively full explanation of a small region which is\r\nthen carried over into an explanation of adjoining regions. Growth by\r\nextension can be associated with the metaphors of building a model or\r\nputting together a jigsaw puzzle (Kaplan, 1964, p. 305).\r\n\r\nIn growth by intension, a partial explanation of a whole region is\r\nmade more and more adequate and outlines for subsequent theory and\r\nobservation are clarified. Growth by intension is associated with the\r\nmetaphor of gradually illuminating a darkened room. A few persons enter\r\nthe room with their individual lights and are able to slowly perceive\r\nwhat is in that room. As more persons enter the room, it becomes more\r\nfully illuminated, and the observed reality is clarified (Kaplan, 1964,\r\np. 305).\r\n\r\nGrowth by extension is implicit in the early caring definitions,\r\nexplications, and models. The knowledge about caring was built up\r\npiece-by-piece, in the first ten years of study, by a few nurse scholars\r\ncommitted to the study of human care and caring.\r\n\r\nToday, some fifteen years later, progress in the study of the caring\r\nphenomenon is no longer piecemeal but gradual and on a larger scale,\r\nwith illumination from the works that have preceded. Growth by\r\nintension is evidenced by the development of an extant bibliography,\r\ncategorization of caring conceptualizations, and the further development\r\nof human care/caring theories. Although the concept of caring has not\r\nbeen definitively and exhaustively explored, the understanding of the\r\nbroad-scale phenomena of human care and caring has become enlarged. A\r\nreview of the caring literature by Smerke (1989) and an analysis of the\r\nnursing research on care and caring by Morse, Bottoroff, Leander, and\r\nSolberg (1990) now provides researchers with an interdisciplinary\r\nguide to human caring literature and a categorization of five major\r\nconceptualizations of caring: (1) a human trait, (2) a moral\r\nimperative, (3) an affect, (4) an interpersonal interaction, and (5)\r\nan intervention. There is now a body of knowledge about care and caring\r\nthat can be used to further develop new knowledge through subsequent\r\ntheory and research.\r\n\r\nThe Boykin and Schoenhofer work, Nursing as Caring: A Model for\r\nTransforming Practice, is an excellent example of growth by intension.\r\nUtilizing previous caring research, caring theory, and personal\r\nknowledge, the authors have put forth a theory that will not only\r\nincrease the content of caring knowledge but will also change its form.\r\nA new theory adds some knowledge and it transforms what was previously\r\nknown, clarifying it and giving it new meaning as well as more\r\nconfirmation. The whole structure of caring knowledge changes with\r\ngrowth, even though it is recognizably similar to what it has been. As\r\none reads this theory, many of the assumptions presented seem familiar,\r\nperhaps because the authors realized that caring theory could best be\r\nunderstood in both its historical and immediate context.\r\n\r\nThe historical context of the systematic study, explication, and\r\ntheorizing about human care and caring phenomena in nursing began some\r\ntwenty years ago with the early work of Madeleine Leininger. The first\r\nstructural stones were laid by a group of nurse researchers who met for\r\nthe first time in 1978 at a conference convened by Dr. Leininger at\r\nthe University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Some sixteen enthusiastic\r\nparticipants underscored the need for continued in-depth thinking and\r\nfor sharing scholarly ideas about the phenomena and nature of caring.\r\n\r\nPlans were made to continue with yearly research conferences focused on\r\nfour major goals:\r\n\r\n1. The identification of major philosophical, epistemological, and\r\nprofessional dimensions of caring to advance the body of knowledge that\r\nconstitutes nursing.\r\n\r\n2. Explication of the nature, scope, and functions of caring and its\r\nrelationship to nursing care.\r\n\r\n3. Explication of the major components, processes, and patterns of\r\ncare or caring in relationship to nursing care from a transcultural\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\n4. Stimulation of nurse scholars to systematically investigate care\r\nand caring and to share their findings with others. These four goals,\r\ndeveloped by the members of the Caring Research Conference Group,\r\nprovided nurse scholars with a direction for caring research that\r\nyielded a substantial piece of research-based literature.\r\n\r\nThe first ten years of the Conference group (1978-1988) witnessed a\r\ngreat deal of diverse and stimulating research. Major philosophical\r\ndimensions of caring were explicated in the works of Bevis (1981), Gaut\r\n(1984), Ray (1981), Roach (1984), and Watson (1979)\r\n\r\nExplication of major components, processes, and patterns of care or\r\ncaring from a transcultural perspective was first developed in the early\r\nwork of Aamodt (1978) and Leininger (1978, 1981), to be followed by the\r\nworks of Baziak-Dugan (1984), Boyle (1984), Guthrie (1981), Wang (1984),\r\nand Wenger and Wenger (1988).\r\n\r\nAnother group of nurse researchers chose to study the concept of care\r\nand caring concomitantly with nursing care practices. Brown (1982),\r\nGardner and Wheeler (1981), Knowlden (1985), Larson (1981, 1984),\r\nRiemen (1984, 1986), Sherwood (1991), and Wolf (1986) investigated nurse\r\nbehaviors perceived by patients and nurses as indicators of caring and\r\nnoncaring in an attempt to further develop the essential structure of a\r\ncaring interaction.\r\n\r\nWatson, Bruckhardt, Brown, Block, and Hester (1979) proposed an\r\nalternative health care model for nursing practice and research. After\r\nseven years of implementation experience using a clinical practice model\r\nwith various hospitals, Wesorick (1990) presented a model that supported\r\ncaring as a practice norm in hospital settings.\r\n\r\nAdministrative caring within an institutional or organizational culture\r\nwas the research focus for Nyberg (1989), Ray (1984, 1989), Valentine\r\n(1989, 1991), and Wesorick (1990, 1991). Caring within educational\r\nsettings and in the teacher-learner relationship also received attention\r\nby Bevis (1978), Bush (1988), Condon (1986), and MacDonald (1984).\r\n\r\nResearch methodologies became a focus of study as investigators\r\nstruggled with how best to study nurse caring phenomena: Boyle (1981),\r\nGaut (1981, 1985), Larson (1981), Leininger (1976), Ray (1985), Riemen\r\n(1986), Swanson-Kauffman (1986), Valentine (1988), Watson (1985), and\r\nWenger (1985).\r\n\r\nBy the 1980s, it became clear that the systematic study of human care\r\nand caring as a distinct feature of the profession of nursing had\r\nevolved globally. Dunlop (1986), from Australia, asked: \"Is a science of\r\ncaring possible?\" Bjrn (1987) described the caring sciences in Denmark,\r\nand Eriksson (1987, 1992) began to develop her theories of caring as\r\ncommunion, and caring as health. Kleppe (1987) discussed the background\r\nand development of caring research in Norway. Flynn (1988) compared\r\nthe caring communities of nursing in England and the United States.\r\nHalldorsdottir (1989, 1991), from Iceland, developed research on caring\r\nand uncaring encounters in nursing practice and in nursing education.\r\n\r\nThe early endeavors of the first nurse researchers who focused on caring\r\nlaid out the lines and clarified the observable realities for subsequent\r\nresearch and theorizing. The production of nursing theory is dependent\r\non an intellectual apprehension of the movement between the concrete\r\nrealities of nursing practice and the abstract world of those\r\nassumptions and propositions known as theories (Benoliel, 1977, p.\r\n110). The creation of new knowledge rests on some known assumptions, and\r\nBoykin and Schoenhofer's theory builds on the work of three other nurse\r\nscholars who have developed theories of caring in nursing, each with\r\na differing apprehension of the realities of human care and caring:\r\nMadeline Leininger from an anthropological perspective--one of the first\r\nnurse theorists to focus on caring as the essence of nursing practice;\r\nSister M. Simone Roach, who provides a philosophical and theological\r\nperspective; and Jean Watson from an existential, philosophical\r\nperspective.\r\n\r\nThe significance of Leininger's Culture-Care Theory (1993) is in the\r\nstudy of human care from a transcultural nursing perspective. This focus\r\nhas led to new and unique insights about care and the nature of caring\r\nand nursing in different cultures, and has developed the knowledge so\r\nessential to providing culturally sensitive nursing care throughout the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nRoach's work, The Human Act of Caring (1984, 1992) is recognized as one\r\nof the most substantive, insightful, and sensitive publications on human\r\ncaring. Her ultimate conclusion after years of study and reflection is:\r\n\"Caring is the human mode of being.\"\r\n\r\nWatson, in her theory of human care (1985, 1989), addressed the issue\r\nof nursing as a humanistic science rather than a formal or biological\r\nscience. This perspective was an essential paradigm shift for nursing\r\nknowledge, but essential for study of the caring phenomena. Within this\r\ncontext, Watson developed a theory of caring in nursing that involves\r\nvalues, a will and a commitment to care, knowledge, caring actions, and\r\nconsequences. Caring then becomes a moral imperative for practitioners\r\nof the profession of nursing.\r\n\r\nBoykin and Schoenhofer's theory comes not only from \"what is known about\r\ncaring\" but also from their imagination and creative sense of \"what\r\ncould be known.\" They suggest a context for personal theorizing about\r\ncaring experiences, trusting that each person will examine the\r\ncontent of those experiences as a sequence of more or less meaningful\r\nevents--meaningful both in them and in the patterns of their occurrence.\r\nThe authors put forth a framework for just such reflection, and they\r\nchallenge practicing nurses to \"come to know self as caring person in\r\never deepening and broadening dimensions.\"\r\n\r\nIf science has to do with knowing and that which is known, then theory\r\nis about knowledge production. In one sense of the term, theory activity\r\nmight well be regarded as most important and distinctive for human\r\nbeings because is stands for the symbolic dimension of experience\r\n(Kaplan, 1964, p. 294).\r\n\r\nBoykin and Schoenhofer's work invites all nurses to develop nursing\r\nknowledge and to theorize from within the nursing situation. The\r\ninvitation requests a sharing of both content and context of nursing\r\nexperiences as they are lived in meaningful patterns that have\r\nsignificant bearings on all other patterns. To engage in theorizing\r\nmeans not only to learn by experience, but to learn from experience--that\r\nis, to take thought about what is there to be learned (Kaplan, 1964, p.\r\n295).\r\n\r\nIn the thinking of Alfred North Whitehead (1967), theory functions\r\nnot to allow prediction but to provide a frame of reference, a pattern\r\nthrough which one can discern particulars of any given situation. Theory\r\nin this sense permits attendance or focus by giving form to otherwise\r\nunstructured content. The proposed theory, Nursing as Caring: A Model\r\nfor Transforming Practice, provides the context. The frame of reference\r\nthrough which any nurse engaged in a shared lived experience of\r\ncaring can not only interpret the experience but also can perceive and\r\nsymbolically express the patterns of nurse caring. The perception\r\nof patterns will give the readers and listeners a \"click of\r\nmeaningfulness,\" and the explanation will be the discovery of\r\ninterconnections among patterns. The perception that everything is just\r\nwhere it should be to complete the pattern is what gives us intellectual\r\nsatisfaction and provides the context or focus for the one aspect of\r\nreality that is the essence of nursing-caring.\r\n\r\nDelores A.

We intend\r\nto offer our perspective of these ideas as influenced by the works of\r\nvarious scholars so that the grounding for Nursing as Caring will be\r\nunderstood. We do not intend to offer a novel perspective of the notion\r\nof person, or a new generic understanding of caring or of discipline\r\nand profession, but to communicate some of the ideas basic to Nursing as\r\nCaring.\r\n\r\n  Major assumptions underlying Nursing as Caring include:\r\n  * persons are caring by virtue of their humanness\r\n  * persons are caring, moment to moment\r\n  * persons are whole or complete in the moment\r\n  * personhood is a process of living grounded in caring\r\n  * personhood is enhanced through participating in nurturing\r\n          relationships with caring others\r\n  * nursing is both a discipline and a profession\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSPECTIVE OF PERSONS AS CARING\r\n\r\nThroughout this book the basic premise presides: all persons are caring.\r\nCaring is an essential feature and expression of being human. The belief\r\nthat all persons, by virtue of their humanness, are caring establishes\r\nthe ontological and ethical ground on which this theory is built.\r\nPersons as caring is a value which underlies each of the major concepts\r\nof Nursing as Caring and is an essential idea for understanding this\r\ntheory and its implications. Being a person means living caring, and it\r\nis through caring that our \"being\" and all possibilities are known to\r\nthe fullest. Elaboration on the meaning of this perspective will provide\r\na necessary backdrop for understanding ideas in subsequent chapters.\r\n\r\nCaring is a process. Each person, throughout his or her life, grows in\r\nthe capacity to express caring. Said another way, each person grows in\r\nhis or her competency to express self as caring person. Because of our\r\nbelief that each person is caring and grows in caring throughout life,\r\nwe will not focus on behaviors considered noncaring in this book. Our\r\nassumption that all persons are caring does not require that every act\r\nof a person necessarily be caring. There are many experiences of life\r\nthat teach us that not every act of a person is caring. These acts\r\nare obviously not expressions of self as caring person and may well\r\nbe labeled noncaring. Developing the fullest potential for expressing\r\ncaring is an ideal. Notwithstanding the abstract context of this ideal,\r\nit is knowing the person as living caring and growing in caring that\r\nis central to our effort in this book. Therefore, even though an act or\r\nacts may be interpreted as noncaring, the person remains caring.\r\n\r\nWhile this assumption does not require that every act be understood as\r\nan expression of caring, the assumption that all persons are caring does\r\nrequire an acceptance that fundamentally, potentially, and actually each\r\nperson is caring. Although persons are innately caring, actualization of\r\nthe potential to express caring varies in the moment and develops\r\nover time. Thus, caring is lived moment to moment and is constantly\r\nunfolding. The development of competency in caring occurs over a\r\nlifetime. Throughout life we come to understand what it means to be a\r\ncaring person, to Live caring, and to nurture each other as caring.\r\n\r\nRoach and Mayeroff provide some explanation as to what caring involves.\r\nRoach in her works (1984, 1987, 1992) has asserted that caring is the\r\n\"human mode of being\" (1992, p. ix). As such, it entails the capacity\r\nto care, the calling forth of this ability in ourselves and others,\r\nresponding to something or someone that matters and finally actualizing\r\nthe ability to care (192, p. 47). Since caring is a characteristic of\r\nbeing human, it cannot be attributed as a manifestation of any single\r\ndiscipline. These beliefs have directly influenced our assumption that\r\nall persons are caring. Mayeroff, a philosopher, in his 1971 book On\r\nCaring, discusses caring as an end in itself, an ideal, and not merely a\r\nmeans to some future end. Within the context of caring as process, Roach\r\n(1992, 1984) says that caring entails the human capacity to care, the\r\ncalling forth of this ability in ourselves and others, the responsivity\r\nto something or someone that matters, and the actualizing of the\r\npower to care. Even though our human nature is to be caring, the full\r\nexpression of this varies with the lived experience of being human.\r\nThe process of bringing forth this capability can be nurtured through\r\nconcern and respect for person as person.\r\n\r\nMayeroff suggests that caring \"is not to be confused with such meanings\r\nas wishing well, liking, comforting, and maintaining . . . it is not\r\nan isolated feeling or a momentary relationship\" (p. 1). He describes\r\ncaring as helping the other grow. In relationships lived through caring,\r\nchanges in the one who cares and the one cared for are evident. Mayeroff\r\ntells us how caring provides meaning and order: In the context of a\r\nman's life, caring has a way of ordering his other values and activities\r\naround it. When this advising is comprehensive, because of the\r\ninclusiveness of his caring, there is a basic stability in his life;\r\nhe is \"in place\" in the world instead of being out of place, or merely\r\ndrifting on endlessly seeking his place. Through caring for certain\r\nothers, by serving them through caring a man lives the meaning of his\r\nown life. In the sense in which a man can ever be said to be at home\r\nin the world, he is at home not through dominating, or explaining, or\r\nappreciating, but through caring and being cared for (1971, p. 2).\r\n\r\nMayeroff expressed ideas about the meaning of being a caring person when\r\nhe referred to trust as \"being entrusted with the care of another\" (p.\r\n7). He spoke of both \"being with\" the other (p. 43) and \"being for\" (p.\r\n42) the other, experiencing the other as an extension of self and at the\r\nsame time \"something separate from me that I respect in its own right\"\r\n(p. 2). To be a caring person means to \"live the meaning of my own life\"\r\n(p. 72), having a sense of stability and basic certainty that allows an\r\nopenness and accessibility, experiencing belonging, living congruence\r\nbetween beliefs and behavior, and expressing a clarity of values that\r\nenables living a simplified rather than a cluttered life.\r\n\r\nWatson, a nursing theorist and philosopher, offers insight into caring.\r\nIn her theory of Human Care, she examines caring as an intersubjective\r\nhuman process expressing respect for the mystery of being-in-the-world,\r\nreflected in the three spheres of mind-body-soul. Human care\r\ntransactions based on reciprocity allow for a unique and authentic\r\nquality of presence in the world of the other. In a related vein, Parse\r\n(1981) defines the ontology of caring as \"risking being with someone\r\ntoward a moment of joy.\" Through being with another, connectedness\r\noccurs and moments of joy are experienced by both.\r\n\r\nIf the ontological basis for being is that all persons are caring\r\nand that by our humanness caring is, then I accept that I am a caring\r\nperson. This belief that all persons are caring, however, entails a\r\ncommitment to know self and other as caring person. According to Trigg\r\n(1973), commitment \"presupposes certain beliefs and also involves a\r\npersonal dedication to the actions implied by them\" (p. 44). Mayeroff\r\n(1971) speaks of this dedication as devotion and states \"devotion is\r\nessential to caring .. . when devotion breaks down, caring breaks down\"\r\n(p. 8). Mayeroff also states that \"obligations that derive from devotion\r\nare a constituent element in caring\" (p. 9). Moral obligations arise\r\nfrom our commitments; therefore, when I make a commitment to caring as a\r\nway of being, I have become morally obligated. The quality of the moral\r\ncommitment is a measure of being \"in place\" in the world. Gadow (1980)\r\nasserts that caring represents the moral ideal of nursing wherein the\r\nhuman dignity of the patient and nurse is recognized and enhanced.\r\n\r\nAs individuals we are continually in the process of developing\r\nexpressions of ourselves as caring persons. The flow of life experiences\r\nprovides ongoing opportunities for knowing self as caring person. As\r\nwe learn to live fully each of these experiences, it becomes easier\r\nto allow self and others the space and time to develop innate caring\r\ncapabilities and authentic being. The awareness of self as caring person\r\ncalls to consciousness the belief that caring, is lived by each person\r\nmoment to moment and directs the \"oughts\" of actions. When decisions are\r\nmade from this perspective, the emerging question consistently is, \"How\r\nought I act as caring person?\"\r\n\r\nHow one is with others is influenced by the degree of authentic\r\nawareness of self as caring person. Caring for self as person requires\r\nexperiencing self as other and yet being one with self, valuing self\r\nas special and unique, and having the courage, humility, and trust to\r\nhonestly know self. It takes courage to let go of the present so that it\r\nmay be transcended and new meaning be discovered. Letting go, of course,\r\nimplies a freeing of oneself from present constraints so that we may see\r\nand be in new ways. One who cares is genuinely humble in being ready and\r\nwilling to know more about self and others. Such humility involves the\r\nrealization that learning is continuous and the recognition that each\r\nexperience is unique. As my commitment to persons as caring moves into\r\nthe future, I must choose again and again to ratify it or not. This\r\ncommitment remains binding and choices are made based on devotion to\r\nthis commitment.\r\n\r\nPersonhood is the process of living grounded in caring. Personhood\r\nimplies living out who we are, demonstrating congruence between beliefs\r\nand behaviors, and living the meaning of one's life. As a process,\r\npersonhood acknowledges the person as having continuous potential for\r\nfurther tapping the current of caring. Therefore, as person we are\r\nconstantly living caring and unfolding possibilities for self as caring\r\nperson in each moment. Personhood is being authentic, being who I am\r\nas caring person in the moment. This process is enhanced through\r\nparticipation in nurturing relationships with others.\r\n\r\nThe nature of relationships is transformed through caring. All relations\r\nbetween and among persons carry with them mutual expectations. Caring\r\nis living in the context of relational responsibilities. A relationship\r\nexperienced through caring holds at its heart the importance of\r\nperson-as-person. Being in the world also mandates participating in\r\nhuman relationships that require re-sponsibility--responsibility to self\r\nand other. To the extent that these relationships are shaped through\r\ncaring, they are consistent with the obligations entailed in relational\r\nresponsibility, and the \"person-al\" (person-to-person) relationships.\r\nWhen being with self and others is approached from a desire to know\r\nperson as living caring, the human potential for actualizing caring\r\ndirects the moment.\r\n\r\nAll relationships are opportunities to draw forth caring possibilities,\r\nopportunities to reinforce the beauty of person-as-person. Through\r\nknowing self as caring person, I am able to be authentic to self and\r\nwith others. I am able to see from the inside what others see from\r\nthe outside. Feelings, attitudes, and actions lived in the moment are\r\nmatched by an inner genuine awareness. The more I am open to knowing\r\nand appreciating self and trying to understand the world of other,\r\nthe greater the awareness of our interconnectedness as caring persons.\r\nKnowing of self frees one to truly be with other. How does one come to\r\nknow self as caring person? Mayeroff's (1971) caring ingredients are\r\nuseful conceptual tools when one is struggling to know self and others\r\nas caring. These ingredients include: honesty, courage, hope, knowing\r\n(both knowing about and knowing directly), trust, humility, and alternating\r\nrhythm. The idea of a hologram serves as a way of understanding\r\nself and other. Pri-bram (1985) offers us an interesting view on\r\nrelationships in his discussion of hologram. He states that the\r\nuniqueness of a hologram is such that if a part (of the hologram) is\r\nbroken, any part of it is capable of reconstructing the total image\r\n(p. 133). Using this idea, if the lens for \"being\" in relationships is\r\nholographic, then the beauty of the person will be retained. Through\r\nentering, experiencing, and appreciating the world of other, the nature\r\nof being human is ore fully understood. The notion of person as whole or\r\ncomplete expresses an important value. As such, the respect for the total\r\nperson--all that is in the moment--is communicated. Therefore, from a\r\nholographic perspective, it is impossible to focus on a part of a person\r\nwithout seeing the whole person reflected in the part. The wholeness\r\n(the fullness of being) is forever present. Perhaps in some context, the\r\nword part is incongruent with this notion that there is only wholeness.\r\nThe term aspect, or dimension, may be a useful substitute.\r\n\r\nThe view of person as caring and complete is also intentional; it offers\r\na lens for a way of being with another that prevents the segmenting\r\nof that other into component parts (e.g., mind, body, spirit). Here,\r\nvaluing and respecting each person's beauty, worth, and uniqueness is\r\nlived as one seeks to understand fully the meaning of values, choices,\r\nand priority systems through which values are expressed. The inherent\r\nvalue that persons reflect and to which they respond is the wholeness\r\nof persons. The person is at all times whole. The idea of wholeness does\r\nnot negate an appreciation of the complexity of being. However, from the\r\nperspective of the theory Nursing as Caring, to encounter person as less\r\nthan whole involves a failure to encounter person. Un-il our view is\r\nsuch that it includes the whole as complete person and not just a part,\r\nwe can not fully know the person. Gadow's (1984) contrasting paradigms,\r\nempathic and philanthropic, are relevant to this understanding. The\r\nphilanthropic paradigm enables a relationship in which dignity is\r\nbestowed as a \"gift from one who is whole to one who is not\" (p.\r\n68). Philanthropy marks the person as other than one like me. Gadow's\r\nempathic paradigm, on the other hand, \"breaches objectivity\" (p. 67) and\r\nexpresses participating in the experience of another. In the empathic\r\nparadigm, the subjectivity of the other is \"assumed to be as whole and\r\nvalid as that of the caregiver\" (p. 68). These paradigm descriptions\r\nfacilitate our knowing how we are with others. Is the attitude expressed\r\nthrough nursing one of person as part or person as whole? How do these\r\nperspectives direct nursing practice?\r\n\r\nOur understanding of person as caring centers on valuing and celebrating\r\nhuman wholeness, the human person as living and growing in caring, and\r\nactive personal engagement with others. This perspective of what it\r\nmeans to be human is the foundation for understanding nursing as a human\r\nendeavor, a person-to-person service, a human social institution, and a\r\nhuman science.\r\n\r\nOur view enables the development of nursing as a discipline of constant\r\ndiscovery and new knowing.\r\n\r\nLike disciplines, professions have unique characteristics, as defined\r\nby Flexner. Flexner (1919) initially identified as the most basic\r\ncharacteristic of a profession that it addresses a unique and urgent\r\nsocial need through techniques derived from a tested knowledge base.\r\nProfessions have their historical roots in those human services that\r\npeople provided for each other within existing social institutions\r\n(e.g., tribe, family, or community). Thus, each profession, including\r\nnursing, has its origins in everyday human situations and the everyday\r\ncontributions people make to the welfare of others. Flexner's founding\r\nconditions for the designation profession are reiterated in the American\r\nNursing Association's 1980 Social Policy Statement, in which the idea of\r\na social contract is addressed.\r\n\r\nNursing: A Social Policy Statement was intended to provide nurses with\r\na fresh perspective on practice while providing society with a view of\r\nnursing for the 1980s. The overall intent of this document was to call\r\nto consciousness the linkages between the profession and society. While\r\nthe Social Policy Statement is considered by many (see, for example,\r\nRodgers, 1991; Packard & Polifroni, 1991; Allen, 1987; White, 1984) to\r\nbe outdated, we find the concept of the social contract to be useful\r\nwhen studying the relationship of nurse to nursed. As the foundation\r\nfor professions, the social contract, while understood to be an\r\n\"hypothetical ideal\" (Silva, 1983, p. 150), is also an expression of\r\na people recognizing (1) the presence of a basic need and (2) the\r\nexistence of greater knowledge and skill available to meet that need\r\nthan can be readily exercised by each member of the society. Society\r\nat large then calls for commitment by a segment of society to the\r\nacquisition and use of this knowledge and skill for the good of all.\r\nSocial goods are promised in return for this commitment.\r\n\r\nToday, the profession of nursing is moving from a social contract\r\nrelationship toward a covenantal relationship between the nurse and\r\nnursed. While the social contract implies an impersonal, legalistic\r\nstance, the covenantal relationship emphasizes personal engagement and\r\never present freedom to choose commitments. Cooper (1988), for example,\r\ndiscusses her ideas on the relevance of covenantal relationships for\r\nnursing ethics. She states \"the promissory nature of the covenant\r\nis contained in the willingness of individuals to enter a covenental\r\nrelationship\" (p. 51) and it is within this context that obligations\r\narise. As caring persons, we \"see\" relationship (covenant) and honor\r\nthe bond between self and other. The ultimate knowledge gained from this\r\nperspective is that we are related to one another (and to the universe)\r\nand that harmony (brotherhood and sisterhood) is present as we live out\r\ncaring relationships.\r\n\r\nConcepts of discipline and profession have been dismissed by critical\r\ntheorists as oppressive, anachronistic, and paternalistic (Allen, 1985;\r\nRodgers, 1991). In our study however, as we have explored essential\r\nmeanings of these concepts, we have found that they express fundamental\r\nvalues congruent with cherished nursing values. Although we can agree\r\nwith critical theorists that discipline and profession have been\r\nmisused, perhaps too frequently, as tools of social elitism and\r\noppression, this misuse remains inappropriate because it violates the\r\ncovenantal nature of discipline and profession.\r\n\r\nThe discipline of nursing attends to the discovery, creation,\r\nstructuring, testing, and refinement of knowledge needed for the\r\npractice of nursing. Concomitantly, the profession of nursing attends\r\nto the use of that knowledge in response to specific human needs.\r\nCertainly, the basic values communicated in the concepts of discipline\r\nand profession are resonate with fundamental nursing values and\r\ncontribute to a fuller understanding of nursing as caring. Included\r\namong those shared values are commitment to something that matters,\r\nsense of persons being connected in oneness; expression of human\r\nimagination and creativity, realization of the unity of knowing with\r\npossibilities unfolding, and expression of choice and responsibility.\r\n\r\nWe have deliberately used the term general theory of nursing to\r\ncharacterize our work. The concept of a general theory is particularly\r\nuseful in the context of levels of theory. Other authors have addressed\r\nwhat they see as three levels of nursing theory: general or grand,\r\nmid-range, and practice (Walker & Avant, 1988; Fawcett, 1989; Chinn\r\n& Jacobs, 1987: Nursing Development Conference Group, 1979). What we\r\nintend by the use of the term general theory is similar to \"conceptual\r\nframework,\" \"conceptual model,\" or \"paradigm.\" That is, a general theory\r\nis a framework for understanding any and all instances of nursing, and\r\nmay be used to describe or to project any given situation of nursing.\r\nIt is a system of values ordered specifically to reflect a philosophy of\r\nnursing to guide knowledge generation and to inform practice.\r\n\r\nThe statement of focus of any general nursing theory offers an\r\nexplicit expression of the social need that calls for and justifies the\r\nprofessional service of nursing. In addition, the statement of focus\r\nexpresses the domain of a discipline as well as the intent of the\r\nprofession, and thus directs the development of the requisite nursing\r\nknowledge. Activity to develop and use nursing knowledge has its ethical\r\nground in the idea of the covenantal relationship as expressed in the\r\nspecific focus of the profession. Fundamental values inherent in the\r\ndiscipline and profession of nursing derive from an understanding of the\r\nfocus of nursing.\r\n\r\nThe conception of nursing that we have used in this book views nursing\r\nscience as a form of human science. Nursing as caring focuses on the\r\nknowledge needed to understand the fullness of what it means to be human\r\nand on the methods to verify this knowledge. For this reason, we have\r\nnot accepted the traditional notion of theory which relies on the\r\n\"received\" view of science, and depends on measurement as the ultimate\r\ntool for legitimate knowledge development. The human science of nursing\r\nrequires the use of all ways of knowing.\r\n\r\nCarper's (1978) fundamental patterns of knowing in nursing are useful\r\nconceptual tools for expanding our view of nursing science as human\r\nscience here. These patterns provide an organizing framework for asking\r\nepistemological questions of caring in nursing. To experience knowing\r\nthe whole of a nursing situation with caring as the central focus, each\r\nof these patterns comes into play. Personal knowing focuses on knowing\r\nand encountering self and other intuitively, the empirical pathway\r\naddresses the sense, ethical knowing focuses on moral knowing of what\r\n\"ought to be\" in nursing situations, and aesthetic knowing involves the\r\nappreciating and creating that integrates all patterns of knowing\r\nin relation to a particular situation. Through the richness of the\r\nknowledge gleaned, the nurse as artist creates the caring moment (Boykin\r\n& Schoenhofer, 1990).\r\n\r\nNursing, as we have come to understand our discipline, is not a\r\nnormative science that stands outside a situation to evaluate current\r\nobservations against empirically derived and tested normative standards.\r\nNursing as a human science takes its value from the knowledge created\r\nwithin the shared lived experience of the unique nursing situation.\r\nAlthough empirical facts and norms do play a role in nursing knowledge,\r\nwe must remember that that role is not one of unmediated application.\r\nKnowledge of nursing comes from within the situation. The nurse reaches\r\nout into a body of normative information, transforming that information\r\nas understanding is created from within the situation. The same can\r\nbe said for personal and ethical knowing. Each serves as a pathway for\r\ntransforming knowledge in the creation of aesthetic knowing within\r\nthe nursing situation. The view we have taken unifies previously\r\ndichotomized notions of nursing as science and nursing as art and\r\nrequires a new understanding of science.\r\n\r\nNursing as caring reflects an appreciation of persons in the fullness\r\nof per-sonhood within the context of the nursing situation. This view\r\ntranscends perspectives adopted in an earlier period of nursing science\r\nphilosophy. Examples of the earlier view include the notions of basic\r\nversus applied science, and metaphysics versus theory. The idea of a\r\nbasic science of nursing disconnects nursing from its very ground of\r\nethical value. Without a grounding in praxis, the content and activity\r\nof nursing science becomes amoral and meaningless. Similarly, this view\r\ntranscends an earlier view of nursing theory that treated the unitary\r\nphenomenon of nursing as being composed of concepts that could be\r\nstudied independently or as \"independent and dependent variables.\"\r\nNursing as caring resists fragmentation of the unitary phenomenon of\r\nour discipline. In subsequent chapters, we will more fully explore\r\nimplications of this view of nursing as a human science discipline and\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Allen, D.G. (1985).

While we will discuss the meaning of that\r\nstatement of focus in general terms, we will also describe specific\r\nconcepts inherent in this focus in the context of the general theory.\r\n\r\nIf you recall, in Chapter 1 we discussed the several major assumptions\r\nthat ground the theory of Nursing as Caring:\r\n\r\n  * Persons are caring by virtue of their humanness\r\n  * Persons are whole or complete in the moment\r\n  * Persons live caring, moment to moment\r\n  * Personhood is a process of living grounded in caring\r\n  * Personhood is enhanced through participating in nurturing\r\n           relationships with caring others\r\n  * Nursing is both a discipline and profession\r\n\r\nIn this and succeeding chapters, we will develop the nursing\r\nimplications of these assumptions.\r\n\r\nAll persons are caring. This is the fundamental view that grounds\r\nthe focus of nursing as a discipline and a profession. The unique\r\nperspective offered by the theory of Nursing as Caring builds on that\r\nview by recognizing personhood as a process of living grounded in\r\ncaring. This is meant to imply that the fullness of being human is\r\nexpressed as one lives caring uniquely day to day. The process of\r\nliving grounded in caring is enhanced through participation in nurturing\r\nrelationships with caring others, particularly in nursing relationships.\r\n\r\nWithin the theoretical perspective given herein, a further major\r\nassumption appears: persons are viewed as already complete and\r\ncontinuously growing in completeness, fully caring and unfolding caring\r\npossibilities moment-to-moment. Such a view assumes that caring is being\r\nlived by each of us, moment to moment. Expressions of self as caring\r\nperson are complete in the moment as caring possibilities unfold; thus,\r\nnotwithstanding other life contingencies, one continues to grow in\r\ncaring competency, in fully expressing self as caring person. To say\r\nthat one is fully caring in the moment also involves a recognition of\r\nthe uniqueness of person with each moment presenting new possibilities\r\nto know self as caring person. The notion of \"in the moment\" reflects\r\nthe\r\n\r\nidea that competency in knowing self as caring and as living caring\r\ngrows throughout life. Being complete in the moment also signifies\r\nsomething more: there is no insufficiency, no brokenness, or absence\r\nof something. As a result, nursing activities are not directed toward\r\nhealing in the sense of making whole; from our perspective, wholeness is\r\npresent and unfolding. There is no lack, failure, or inadequacy which is\r\nto be corrected through nursing--persons are whole, complete, and caring.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Nursing as Caring, then, is based on an understanding that\r\nthe focus of nursing, both as a discipline and as a profession, involves\r\nthe nurturing of persons living caring and growing in caring. In this\r\nstatement of focus, we recognize the unique human need to which nursing\r\nis the response as a desire to be recognized as caring person and to be\r\nsupported in caring.\r\n\r\nThis focus also requires that the nurse know the person seeking\r\nnursing as caring person and that the nursing action be directed toward\r\nnurturing the nursed in their living caring and growing in caring. We\r\nwill briefly discuss this theory in general terms here and more fully\r\nilluminate it in subsequent chapters on nursing practice (Chapter 4),\r\neducation (Chapter 5), and scholarship (Chapter 6). We will address\r\nadministration of nursing services and of nursing education programs in\r\nChapters 4 and 5, respectively.\r\n\r\nNurturing persons living caring and growing in caring at first glance\r\nappears broad and abstract. In some ways, the focus is broad in that it\r\napplies to nursing situations in a wide variety of practical settings.\r\nOn the other hand, it takes on specific and practical meaning in the\r\ncontext of individual nursing situations as the nurse attempts to know\r\nthe nursed as caring person and focuses on nurturing that person as he\r\nor she lives and grows in caring.\r\n\r\nWhen approaching a situation from this perspective, we understand each\r\nperson as fundamentally caring, living caring in his or her everyday\r\nlife. Forms of expressing one's unique ways of living caring are limited\r\nonly by the imagination. Recognizing unique personal ways of living\r\ncaring also requires an ethical commitment and knowledge of caring. In\r\nour everyday lives, failures to express caring are readily recognized.\r\nThe ability to articulate instances of noncaring does not seem to\r\ntake any particular skill. When nursing is called for, however, it\r\nis necessary that nurses have the commitment, knowledge, and skill to\r\ndiscover the individual unique caring person to be nursed. For example,\r\nthe nurse may encounter one who may be described as despairing. Relating\r\nto that person as helpless recalls Gadow's (1984) characterization of\r\nthe philanthropic paradigm which assumes \"sufficiency and independence\r\non one side and needy dependence on the other\" (p. 68). The relationship\r\ngrounded in nursing as caring would enable the nurse to connect with the\r\nhope that underlies an expression of despair or hopelessness. Personal\r\nexpressions such as despair, or fear, or anger, for example, are neither\r\nignored nor discounted. Rather, they are understood as the caring value\r\nwhich is in some way present. An honest expression of fear or anger, for\r\nexample, is also an expression of vulnerability, which expresses\r\ncourage and humility. We reiterate that our approach is grounded in the\r\nfundamental assumption that all persons are caring and the commitment\r\nwhich arises from this basic value position.\r\n\r\nIt is this understanding of person as caring that directs professional\r\nnursing decision making and action from the point of view of our Nursing\r\nas Caring theory. The nurse enters into the world of the other person\r\nwith the intention of knowing the other as caring person. It is in\r\nknowing the other in their \"living caring and growing in caring\" that\r\ncalls for nursing are heard. Of equal importance is our coming to\r\nknow how the other is living caring in the situation and expressing\r\naspirations for growing in caring. The call for nursing is a call for\r\nacknowledgement and affirmation of the person living caring in specific\r\nways in this immediate situation. The call for nursing says \"know me as\r\ncaring person now and affirm me.\" The call for nursing evokes specific\r\ncaring responses to sustain and enhance the other as they live caring\r\nand grow in caring in the situation of concern. This caring nurturance\r\nis what we call the nursing response.\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING SITUATION\r\n\r\nThe nursing situation is a key concept in the theory of Nursing\r\nas Caring. Thus, we understand nursing situation as a shared lived\r\nexperience in which the caring between nurse and nursed enhances\r\npersonhood. The nursing situation is the locus of all that is known and\r\ndone in nursing. It is in this context that nursing lives. The content\r\nand structure of nursing knowledge are known through the study of\r\nthe nursing situation. The content of nursing knowledge is generated,\r\ndeveloped, conserved, and known through the lived experience of the\r\nnursing situation. Nursing situation as a construct is constituted\r\nin the mind of the nurse when the nurse conceptualizes or prepares to\r\nconceptualize a call for nursing. In other words, when a nurse\r\nengages in any situation from a nursing focus, a nursing situation is\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nIn the Scandinavian countries, for instance, all the helping disciplines\r\nare called caring sciences. Professions such as medicine, social work,\r\nclinical psychology, and pastoral counseling have a caring function;\r\nhowever, caring per se is not their focus. Rather, the focus of each\r\nof these professions addresses particular forms of caring or caring in\r\nparticular ranges of life situations. In nursing situations, the nurse\r\nfocuses on nurturing person as they live and grow in caring. While\r\ncaring is not unique to nursing, it is uniquely expressed in nursing.\r\nThe uniqueness of caring in nursing lies in the intention expressed\r\nby the statement of focus. As an expression of nursing, caring is the\r\nintentional and authentic presence of the nurse with another who is\r\nrecognized as person living caring and growing in caring. Here, the\r\nnurse endeavors to come to know the other as caring person and seeks\r\nto understand how that person might be supported, sustained, and\r\nstrengthened in kis or her unique process of living caring and growing\r\nin caring. Again, each person in interaction in the nursing situation is\r\nknown as caring. Each person grows in caring through interconnectedness\r\nwith other.\r\n\r\nCalls for nursing are calls for nurturance through personal expressions\r\nof caring, and originate within persons who are living caring in their\r\nlives and hold dreams and aspirations of growing in caring. Again,\r\nthe nurse responds to the call of the caring person, not to some\r\ndetermination of an absence of caring. The contributions of each person\r\nin the nursing situation are also directed toward a common purpose, the\r\nnurturance of the person in living and growing in caring.\r\n\r\nIn responding to the nursing call, the nurse brings an expert (expert\r\nin the sense of deliberately developed) knowledge of what it means to be\r\nhuman, to be caring, as a fully developed commitment to recognizing and\r\nnurturing caring in all situations. The nurse enters the other's world\r\nin order to know the person as caring. The nurse comes to know how\r\ncaring is being lived in the moment, discovering unfolding possibilities\r\nfor growing in caring. This knowing clarifies the nurse's understanding\r\nof the call and guides the nursing response. In this context, the\r\ngeneral knowledge the nurse brings to the situation is transformed\r\nthrough an understanding of the uniqueness of that particular situation.\r\n\r\nEvery nursing situation is a lived experience involving at least two\r\nunique persons. Therefore, each nursing situation differs from any\r\nother. The reciprocal nature of the lived experience of the nursing\r\nsituation requires a personal investment of both caring persons. The\r\ninitial focus is on knowing persons as caring, both nurse and nursed.\r\nThe process for knowing self and other as caring involves a constant and\r\nmutual unfolding. In order to know the other, the nurse must be willing\r\nto risk entering the other's world. For his or her part, other person\r\nmust be willing to allow the nurse to enter his or her world this to\r\nhappen, the acceptance of trust and strength of courage needed, person\r\nin the nursing situation can be awe-inspiring.\r\n\r\nIt is through the openness and willingness in the nursing situation that\r\npresence with other occurs. Presence develops as the nurse is willing to\r\nrisk entering the world of the other and as the other invites the nurse\r\ninto a special, intimate space. The encountering of the nurse and the\r\nnursed gives rise to a phenomenon we call caring between, within which\r\npersonhood is nurtured. The nurse as caring person is fully present\r\nand gives the other time and space to grow. Through presence and\r\nintentionality, the nurse is able to know the other in his or her\r\nliving and growing in caring. This personal knowing enables the nurse\r\nto respond to the unique call for nurturing personhood. Of course,\r\nresponses to nursing calls are as varied as the calls themselves. All\r\ntruly nursing responses are expressions of caring and are directed\r\ntoward nurturing persons as they live and grow in the caring in the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn the situation, the nurse draws on personal, empirical, and ethical\r\nknowing to bring to life the artistry of nursing. When the nurse, as\r\nartist, creates a unique approach to care based on the dreams and goals\r\nof the one cared for, the moment comes alive with possibilities. Through\r\nthe aesthetic, the nurse is free to know and express the beauty of the\r\ncaring moment (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1991). This full engagement within\r\nthe nursing situation allows the nurse to truly experience nursing as\r\ncaring, and to share that experience with the one nursed.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 1, we noted that each profession arose from some everyday\r\nservice given by one person or another. Nursing has long been associated\r\nwith the idea of mothering, when mothering is understood as nurturing\r\nthe personhood of another. The ideal mother (and father) recognizes\r\nthe child as caring person, perfect in the moment and unfolding\r\npossibilities for becoming. The parent acknowledges and affirms the\r\nchild as caring person and provides the caring environment that nurtures\r\nthe child in living and growing in caring. The origins of nursing may\r\nwell be found in the intimacy of parental caring. The roles of both\r\nparent and nurse permit and at times even expect that one be involved in\r\nthe intimacy of the daily life of another. The parent is present in all\r\nsituations to care for the child. Ideally, parents know the child as\r\neminently worthwhile and caring, despite all the limitations and human\r\nfrailties. As we recognized in Chapter 1, professions arise from the\r\nspecial needs of everyday situations, and nursing has perhaps emerged\r\nin relation to a type of caring that is synonymous with parenthood\r\nand friendship. The professional nurse, schooled in the discipline\r\nof nursing, brings expert knowledge of human caring to the nursing\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of nursing model development, nursing scholars\r\nendeavored to articulate their discipline using the perspective of\r\nanother discipline, for example, medicine, sociology, or psychology.\r\nOne example of this endeavor is the Roy Adaptation Model, in which\r\nscientific assumptions reflect von Bertalanffy's general systems theory\r\nand Helson's adaptation level theory (Roy and Andrews, 1991, p. 5).\r\nParson's theory of Social System Analysis is reflected in Johnson's\r\nBehavioral System Model for Nursing and Orem's Self-Care Deficit Theory\r\nof Nursing (Meleis, 1985). A second trend involved declaring that the\r\nuniqueness of nursing was in the way in which it integrated and applied\r\nconcepts from other disciplines. The emphasis in the 1960s on nursing\r\nmodel development came as an effort to articulate and structure the\r\nsubstance of nursing knowledge. This work was needed to enhance nursing\r\neducation, previously based on rules of practice, and to provide\r\na foundation for an emerging interest in nursing research. Nursing\r\nscholars engaged in model development as an expression of their\r\ncommitment to the advancement of nursing as a discipline and profession,\r\nand we applaud their contributions. It is our view, however, that these\r\nearly models, grounded in other disciplines, do not directly address the\r\nessence of nursing. The development of Nursing as Caring has benefited\r\nfrom these earlier efforts as well as from the work of more recent\r\nscholarship that posits caring as the central construct and essence\r\n(Leininger, 1988), and the moral ideal of Nursing (Watson, 1985).\r\n\r\nThe perspective of nursing presented here is notably different from most\r\nconceptual models and general theories in the field. The most radical\r\ndifference becomes apparent in the form of the call for nursing. Most\r\nextant nursing theories, modeled after medicine and other professional\r\nfields, present the formal occasion for nursing as problem, need, or\r\ndeficit (e.g., Self-Care)\r\n\r\nDeficit Theory [Orem, 1985], Adaptation Nursing [Roy and Andrews,\r\n1991], Behavioral System Model [Johnson, 1980], and [Neuman, 1989.]\r\nSuch theories then explain how nursing acts to right the wrong, meet the\r\nneed, or eliminate or ameliorate the deficit.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Nursing as Caring proceeds from a frame of reference\r\nbased on interconnectedness and collegiality rather than on esoteric\r\nknowledge, technical expertise, and disempowering hierarchies. In\r\ncontrast, our emerging theory of nursing is based on an egalitarian\r\nmodel of helping that bears witness to and celebrates the human person\r\nin the fullness of his or her being, rather than on some less-than-whole\r\ncondition of being.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Boykin, A., & Schoenhofer, S.

We have claimed that all nursing knowledge\r\nresides within the nursing situation (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1991). The\r\nnursing situation is both the repository of nursing knowledge and the\r\ncontext for knowing nursing. The nursing situation is known as shared\r\nlived experience in which the caring between the nurse and the one\r\nnursed enhances personhood.\r\n\r\nIt is to the nursing situation that the nurse brings self as caring\r\nperson. It is within the nursing situation that the nurse comes to know\r\nthe other as caring person, expressing unique ways of living and growing\r\nin caring. And it is in the nursing situation that the nurse attends to\r\ncalls for caring, creating caring responses that nurture personhood. It\r\nis within the nursing situation that the nurse comes to know nursing, in\r\nthe fullness of aesthetic knowing.\r\n\r\nThe nursing situation comes into being when the nurse actualizes a\r\npersonal and professional commitment to the belief that all persons\r\nare caring. It should be recognized that a nurse can engage in many\r\nactivities in an occupational role that are not necessarily expressions\r\nof nursing. When a nurse practices nursing thoughtfully, that nurse\r\nis guided by his or her conception of nursing. The concept of nursing\r\nformalized in the Nursing as Caring theory is at the very heart of\r\nnursing, extending back into the unrecorded beginnings of nursing\r\nand forward into the future. Acknowledgement of caring as the core\r\nof nursing implies that any nurse practicing nursing thoughtfully is\r\ncreating and living nursing situations because, whether explicit or\r\ntacit, the caring intent of nursing is present.\r\n\r\nRemember that the nursing situation is a construct held by the nurse,\r\nany interpersonal experience contains the potential to become a nursing\r\nsituation. In the formal sense of professional nursing, the nursing\r\nsituation develops when one person presents self in the role of offering\r\nthe professional service of nursing and the other presents self in the\r\nrole of seeking, wanting, or accepting nursing service.\r\n\r\nThe nurse intentionally enters the situation for the purpose of coming\r\nto know the other as caring person. The nurse is also allowing self\r\nto be known as caring person. Authentic presence, like most human\r\ncapacities, is inherent and can be more fully developed through\r\nintention and deliberate effort. Authentic presence may be understood\r\nsimply as one's intentionally being there with another in the fullness\r\nof one's personhood. Caring communicated through authentic presence\r\nis the initiating and sustaining medium of nursing within the nursing\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThe nurse, with developed authentic presence and open to knowing the\r\nother as caring, begins to understand the other's call for nursing.\r\nA call for nursing is a call for specific forms of caring that\r\nacknowledge, affirm, and sustain the other as they strive to live caring\r\nuniquely. We must remember as well that calls for nursing originate\r\nwithin the unique relationship of the nursing situation. As the\r\nsituation ensues, the call for nursing clarifies. The nurse comes to\r\nknow the one nursed more and more deeply and to understand more fully\r\nthe unique meaning of the person's caring ways and aspirations for\r\ngrowing in caring. It is in this understanding that the call for nursing\r\nis known as a specific situated expression of caring and a call for\r\nexplicit caring response.\r\n\r\nThe nursing response of caring is also uniquely lived within each\r\nnursing situation. In the nursing situation, the call of the nursed is a\r\npersonal \"reaching out\" to a hoped-for other. The nursed calls forth\r\nthe nurse's personal caring response. While the range and scope of human\r\ncaring expression can and must be studied, the caring response called\r\nforth in each nursing situation is created for that moment. The nurse\r\nresponds to each call for nursing in a way that uniquely represents the\r\nfullness (wholeness) of the nurse. How I might respond to such a call\r\nwould and should reflect my unique living of caring as person and\r\nnurse. Each response to a particular nursing situation would be slightly\r\ndifferent and would portray the beauty of the nurse as person.\r\n\r\nThe nursing situation is a shared lived experience. The nurse joins in\r\nthe life process of the person nursed and brings his or her life process\r\nto the relationship as well. In the nursing situation, there is caring\r\nbetween the participants. Further, the experience of the caring within\r\nthe nursing situation enhances personhood, the process of living\r\ngrounded in caring. Each of these components of the construct of\r\nthe nursing situation raises questions for immediate and continuing\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nHow can an unconscious patient be a participant in a nursing situation?\r\nCan \"postmortem care\" be considered nursing? How can the nurse know that\r\nthe other is truly open to nursing--can the nurse impose self into the\r\nworld of the other? What about an unrepentant child rapist or a person\r\nresponsible for genocide, can we say that person is caring, and if not,\r\ncan we nurse them? Does the nurse have to like the person being nursed?\r\nDoes the nurse seek enhancement of personhood in the nursing situation?\r\nIf so, might the goals of the nurse be imposed on the one nursed? If the\r\nnurse gains from the nursing situation, isn't that unprofessional?\r\n\r\nIn part, these legitimate questions raise larger issues about the\r\nuniqueness and scope of nursing as a discipline and professional service\r\nin society. Certainly the study of these questions adds clarity to the\r\npurpose of nursing actions. To nurse, situations in a general sense\r\nare transcended and transformed When they are conceptualized as nursing\r\nsituations. From the perspective of the Nursing as Caring theory, the\r\nstudy of these questions would require that the nurse transcend social\r\nor other situational contexts and live out a commitment to nurture the\r\nperson in the nursing situation as they live and grow in caring.\r\n\r\nPersons with altered levels of consciousness, measured on normative\r\nscales developed for medical science purposes, can and do participate\r\nin nursing situations. Nurses committed to knowing the unconscious as\r\ncaring person can and do describe their ways of expressing caring and\r\naspirations for growing in caring. Nurses speak of the post-anesthesia\r\npatient as living hope in their struggle to emerge from the deadening\r\neffects of the anesthesia; as living honestly in fretful, fearful\r\nthrashing. Nurses help these persons sustain hope and extend honesty\r\nthrough their care. The profoundly mentally disabled child lives\r\nhumility moment-to-moment and calls forth caring responses to validate\r\nand nurture that beautiful humility. Nurses speak of caring for their\r\ndeceased patients as nursing those who have gone and are still in some\r\nway present. The nurse, connected in oneness with the one known\r\nand nursed, holds hope for the other as the other's expression of\r\nhopefulness lives on in the consciousness of the nurse. Thus, a sense\r\nof connectedness does not dissipate when physical presence ends, but\r\nremains an active part of the nurse's experience.\r\n\r\nNursing another is a service of caring, communicated through authentic\r\npresence. Nursing another means living out a commitment to knowing the\r\nother as caring person and responding to the caring other as someone of\r\nvalue (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1990, 1991). In its fullest sense, nursing\r\ncannot be rendered impersonally, but must be offered in a spirit of\r\nbeing connected in oneness. \"To care for\" seems to require that the\r\ncaregiver see oneself as caring person reflected in the other (Watson,\r\n1987). The theoretical perspective of Nursing as Caring is grounded in\r\nthe belief that caring is the human mode of being (Roach, 1984). When\r\na person is judged by social standards to be deviant and even\r\nevil, however, it is difficult to summon caring. This points to the\r\ncontribution nursing is called upon to make in society. When we speak\r\nof nursing's contribution here, we are invoking earlier discussions of\r\ndiscipline and profession. Each discipline and profession illuminates a\r\nspecial aspect of person--in effect, what it means to be human. The light\r\nthat nursing shines on the world of person is knowledge of person as\r\ncaring, so that the particular contribution of nursing is to illuminate\r\nthe person as caring, living caring uniquely in situation and growing in\r\ncaring. In nursing, practiced within the context of Nursing as Caring,\r\nthe person is taken at face value as caring and never needs to prove\r\nhim or herself as caring. The nurse, practicing within the context of\r\nNursing as Caring, is skilled at recognizing and affirming caring in\r\nself and others. Being caring, that is, living one's commitment to this\r\nvalue \"important-in-self\" (Roach, 1984), fuels the nurse's growing in\r\ncaring and enables the nurse I turn to nurture others in their living\r\nand growing in caring. The values and assumptions of nursing as caring\r\ncan assist the nurse to engage fully in nursing situations with persons\r\nin whom caring is difficult to discover.\r\n\r\nNursing knowledge is discovered and tested in the ongoing nursing\r\nsituations. Once experienced, nursing situations can be made\r\navailable for living anew, with new discovery and testing. Aesthetic\r\nrepresentation of nursing situations brings the lived experience into\r\nthe realm of new experience. Thus, the knowledge of nursing can be made\r\navailable for further study. Re-presentation of nursing situations\r\ncan occur through the medium of nursing stories, poetry, painting,\r\nsculpture, and other art forms (Schoenhofer, 1989). Aesthetic\r\nre-presentation conserves the epistemic integrity of nursing while\r\npermitting full appreciation of the singularity of any one nursing\r\nsituation (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1991). Here, then, is one nurse's story\r\nof a shared lived experience in which the caring between nurse and the\r\none nursed enhanced personhood. This story is offered as an example\r\nof nursing situation, re-presented as an open text, available for\r\ncontinuing participation by all who wish to enter into this shared lived\r\nexperience of nursing. In fact, we invite the reader to enter into this\r\nnursing situation, which may then be used in classroom or conference\r\nsettings to stimulate general or specific inquiry and dialogue.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTIONS\r\n\r\n  One night as I listened to the change of shift report, I remember the\r\n  strange feeling in the pit of my stomach when the evening nurse reviewed\r\n  the lab tests on Tracy P Tall, strawberry-blonde and freckle-faced,\r\n  Tracy was struggling with the everyday problems of adolescence and\r\n  fighting a losing battle against leukemia. Tracy rarely had visitors.\r\n  As I talked with Tracy this night I felt resentment from her toward her\r\n  mother, and I experienced a sense of urgency that her mother be with\r\n  her. With Tracy's permission I called her mother and told her that Tracy\r\n  needed her that night. I learned that she was a single mother with\r\n  two other small children, and that she lived several hours from the\r\n  hospital. When she arrived at the hospital, distance and silence\r\n  prevailed. With encouragement, the mother sat close to Tracy and I sat\r\n  on the other side, stroking Tracy's arm. I left the room to make rounds\r\n  and upon return found Mrs. P. still sitting on the edge of the bed\r\n  fighting to stay awake. I gently asked Tracy if we could lie on the bed\r\n  with her. She nodded. The three of us lay there for a period of time and\r\n  I then left the room. Later, when I returned, I found Tracy wrapped\r\n  in her mothers arms. Her mothers eyes met mine as she whispered \"she's\r\n  gone.\" And then, \"please don't take her yet.\" I left the room and closed\r\n  the door quietly behind me. It was just after 6 o'clock when I slipped\r\n  back into the room just as the early morning light was coming through\r\n  the window. \"Mrs. P,\" I reached out and touched her arm. She raised her\r\n  tear-streaked face to look at me. \"It's time,\" I said and waited. When\r\n  she was ready, I helped her off the bed and held her in my arms for\r\n  a few moments. We cried together. \"Thank you, nurse,\" she said as she\r\n  looked into my eyes and pressed my hand between hers. Then she turned\r\n  and walked away. The tears continued down my cheeks as I followed her to\r\n  the door and watched her disappear down the hall.\r\n\r\n                                                   Gayle Maxwell (1990)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis nursing situation is replete with possibilities for nurses, and\r\nothers, to understand nursing as nurturing persons living caring and\r\ngrowing in caring. A dialogue ensues on the nursing situation that\r\nallows participants an opportunity to experience both resonance and\r\nuniqueness as personal and shared understandings emerge. As the reader\r\nenters into the text, the nursing situation is experienced anew,\r\nnow within the presence of two nurses, not one. Though intentionally\r\nentering the situation, the second nurse experiences d affirms being\r\nconnected in oneness with both nurse and nursed as caring lived in the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nGayle entered into Tracy's world that night open to hearing a special\r\ncall. Gayle's openness was partly a reflection of her use of the\r\nempirical pathway of knowing, the data given in report, the comparison\r\nof empirical observations against biological, psychological,\r\ndevelopmental, and social norms. Before discussing our understanding of\r\nGayle's response from the theoretical per-perspective represented,\r\nit might be helpful to compare how the call for nursing may have been\r\ninterpreted if approached, for example, from a psychological framework.\r\nIf the nurse responded from a psychological framework, the problem\r\nidentified would perhaps be conceptualized as denial on the part of\r\nTracy's mother. It could be assumed that Tracy's mother was avoiding the\r\nreality of the impending death of her daughter. Here, the nursing goal\r\nwould be assist the mother in dealing with her denial by facilitating\r\ngrieving. Denial is only one psychological concept that could be applied\r\nin this situation; avoidance, anxiety, and loss are others. When nursing\r\ncare is based on a psychological framework, however, the central theme\r\nof care is likely to be deemphasized in favor of a problem-oriented\r\napproach. The perspective offered by a normative discipline requires\r\na reliance on empirical knowing. Using only the empirical pathway of\r\nknowing, the richness of nursing is lost.\r\n\r\nGayle's personal knowing, her intuition, however, was the pathway\r\nthat illuminated the appreciation of this situation and prompted her\r\nacknowledgement of a call. She heard Tracy's call for intimacy, comfort,\r\nand protection of her mother's presence as she (Tracy) summoned courage\r\nand hope for her journey. Gayle intuitively knew that the specific\r\ncaring being called forth was the caring of a mother. Gayle's caring\r\nresponse also took the form of the courageous acknowledgement of a call\r\nfor nursing that would be difficult to sub-stantiate empirically. Beyond\r\ntelephoning Tracy's mother, Gayle continued her nursing effort to answer\r\nTracy's call for the presence of a mother as she supported Mrs. P. living\r\nher interconnectedness, in being with Tracy. Gayle heard Mrs. P.'s calls\r\nfor knowing, knowing what to do and knowing that it would be right to\r\ndo it, for the courage to be with her daughter in this new difficult\r\npassage. Her response of showing the way reflects hope and humility. The\r\ncaring between the nurse and the ones nursed enhanced the personhood of\r\nall three, as each grew in caring ways. It is possible that the caring\r\nbetween the original participants in the nursing situation and those of\r\nus who are participating through engagement with the text continues to\r\nenhance personhood.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Boykin, A., & Schoenhofer, S.

While all nurses may have (or at least, may\r\nhave had) a sense of self as caring person, practicing within this\r\ntheoretical framework requires a deliberate commitment to developing\r\nthis knowledge. In many settings where nurses find themselves\r\npracticing, there is little in the environment to support a commitment\r\nto ongoing development of a sense of self as caring person. In fact,\r\nmany practice environments seem to support knowing self only as\r\ninstrument, self as technology. When one perceives of one's \"nursing\r\nself\" as a depersonalized, disembodied tool, nursing tends to lose\r\nits flavor and the devoted commitment to nursing burns out. So how to\r\nsustain and actualize this fundamental commitment must be a point of\r\nserious study for the nurse who desires to practice nursing as caring.\r\n\r\nMayeroff's (1971) caring ingredients are useful tools to assist the\r\nnurse in developing an ever-present awareness of self as caring person.\r\nTaking note of personal patterns of expressing hope, honesty, courage,\r\nand the other ingredients is a good starting place. Understanding the\r\nmeaning of living caring in one's own life is an important base for\r\npracticing nursing as caring. In reflecting on a particular lived\r\nexperience of caring, the nurse can seek to understand the ways in which\r\ncaring contributed freedom within the situation--freedom to be, freedom\r\nto choose, and freedom to unfold.\r\n\r\nBecause nursing is a way of living caring in the world, the nurse can\r\nturn his or her attention to personal patterns of nursing as expressions\r\nof caring. As self understanding as caring person accrues, the nurse\r\nsometimes realizes that such self-awareness was there all along--it\r\nwas only waiting to be discovered. Because many nurses were trained to\r\noverlook their caring ways instead of attending to them, nurses may now\r\nneed something similar to, or indeed \"sensitivity training\" itself,\r\nto rediscover and reown the possibilities of self as caring person,\r\npossibilities specific to nursing as a profession and a discipline. This\r\nredirection of focus away from caring may have been related to several\r\nhistorical social movements. First, of course, is the move toward\r\nscience, which for nursing meant that for a period of several decades\r\nnursing education seemed to reject, either partially or totally, the art\r\nof nursing in order to discover a scientific base for practice. Another\r\nrelated process, the technology movement, led nurses to understand care\r\nas a series of sequential actions designed to accomplish a specifiable\r\nend. In this context, nursing care became synonymous with managing\r\navailable technologies. Third, there existed in the history of nursing\r\neducation an era(s) in which nurses were taught to treat symptoms\r\npatients expressed, rather than to care for the person. Fourth,\r\nmaintaining a professional distance was a hallmark of professionalism.\r\nNow, and rightly so, the tide has turned. A reawakening of knowing self\r\nas caring person becomes paramount so that the profession of nursing\r\nreturns caring to the immediacy of the nursing situation.\r\n\r\nWith personal awareness and reflection, developed knowledge of caring\r\nalso arrives through empirical, ethical, and aesthetic modes of knowing.\r\nThere is a growing body of literature in nursing that both attests\r\nto that fact and to the process of how nurses communicate caring in\r\npractice (e.g., Riemen, I 986a, 1986b; Knowlden, 1986; Swanson-Kauffman,\r\n1986a, 1986b; Swanson, 1990; Kahn and Steeves, 1988). Given the various\r\nperspectives offered by the authors just mentioned, the individual nurse\r\ncan enhance his or her ethical self-development as a caring person by\r\ncultivating the practice of weighing the various meanings of caring\r\nnow extant in actual practice situations and then by making choices to\r\nexpress caring creatively. In pursuit of this end, aesthetic knowing\r\noften subsumes and transcends other forms of knowing and thus may\r\noffer the richest mode of knowing caring. Appreciating structure,\r\nform, harmony, and complementarity across a range of situated caring\r\nexpressions enhances knowing self and other as caring persons.\r\n\r\nKnowing self as caring enhances knowing of the other as caring. Knowing\r\nother as caring contributes to our discovery of caring self. Without\r\nknowing the other as caring person, there can be no true nursing. Living\r\na commitment to nursing as caring can be a tremendous challenge when\r\nnurses are asked to care for someone who makes it difficult to care. In\r\neffect, it is impossible to avoid the issue of \"liking\" or \"disliking\"\r\nthe patient. Is it possible to truly care for someone if the nurse\r\ndoesn't like him or her? In this light, another question arises: How can\r\n1 enter the world of another who repulses me? Am I expected to pretend\r\nthat this person (the patient) has not treated others inhumanely (if\r\nthat is the case)? Must I ignore the reality of the other's hatefulness\r\ntoward me (if such exists)? These are questions that come from the human\r\nheart. They express legitimate human issues that present themselves\r\nregularly in nursing situations.\r\n\r\nThe commitment of the nurse practicing nursing as caring is to nurture\r\npersons living caring and growing in caring. Again, this implies\r\nthat the nurse come to know the other as caring person in the moment.\r\n\"Difficult to care\" situations are those that demonstrate the extent\r\nof knowledge and commitment needed to nurse effectively. An everyday\r\nunderstanding of the meaning of caring is obviously inadequate when the\r\nnurse is presented with someone for whom it is difficult to care. In\r\nthese extreme (though not unusual) situations, a task-oriented, non\r\ndiscipline-based concept of nursing may be adequate to assure the\r\ncompletion of certain treatment and surveillance techniques. Still,\r\nin our eyes that is an insufficient response--it certainly is not the\r\nnursing we advocate. The theory, Nursing as Caring, calls upon the\r\nnurse to reach deep within a well-developed knowledge base that has\r\nbeen structured using all available patterns of knowing, grounded in the\r\nobligations inherent in the commitment to know persons as caring. These\r\npatterns of knowing may include intuition, scientifically quantifiable\r\ndata emerging from research, related knowledge from a variety of\r\ndisciplines, ethical beliefs, as well as many other types of knowing.\r\nAll knowledge held by the nurse which may be relevant to understanding\r\nthe situation at hand is drawn forward and integrated into practice\r\nin particular nursing situations. Although the degree of challenge\r\npresented from situation to situation varies, the commitment to know\r\nself and other as caring persons is steadfast.\r\n\r\nCaring expressed in nursing is personal, not abstract. The caring that\r\nis nursing cannot be expressed as an impersonal generalized stance of\r\ngood will, but must be expressed knowledgeably. That is, the caring\r\nthat is nursing must be a lived experience of caring, communicated\r\nintentionally, and in authentic presence through a person-with-person\r\ninterconnectedness, a sense of oneness with self and other. The nurse is\r\nnot expected to be super-human, superficial, or naïve. Rather, a genuine\r\nopenness to caring and a formed intention of knowing the other as caring\r\nperson are required. In this sense, and referring back to patients with\r\nwhom an expression of empathy is problematic; liking may be understood\r\nas a less personally committed form of caring or loving. In other words,\r\nliking is superficial and may not require the devotion needed to know\r\nother as caring. When the nurse truly connects with the other, liking\r\nthe other becomes a moot issue.\r\n\r\nStories nurses tell about their nursing bring to light the sustenance\r\nthey find in the nursing situation. Lived experiences of practice,\r\nrecounted to crystallize the essential meaning of nursing, contain the\r\ntangible seeds of awareness of self as caring person. However, the nurse\r\nmay not be fully aware of self as caring person until the nursing\r\nstory is articulated and shared. When the practicing nurse can begin\r\nto describe practice as the personal expression of caring with and for\r\nanother, possibilities for living nursing as caring emerge.\r\n\r\nHere is one nurse's response to the invitation to tell a story that\r\nconveys the beauty of nursing. The authentic presence of the nurse in\r\nthe following nursing situation focuses on honesty as an expression of\r\nself as caring person.\r\n\r\n\r\nHONESTY\r\n\r\nAs Jason came through the door to RAC, a young black man lying\r\nlifelessly on a stretcher of pale green linen, the surgeon came towards\r\nme telling me not to tell Jason that his biopsy was positive.\r\n\r\nI felt inner terror. A man, less than 18 years old, was going to come\r\nclose to the \"truth\" of living today. Yet the terror inside me was\r\nreally fueled by the becoming moral issue I was going to face soon.\r\n\r\nJason was surely going to ask of the results upon waking from\r\nanesthesia. \"They always do.\" Going to sleep unknowing demands\r\nwaking-to-know. \"Honesty.\"\r\n\r\nHonesty as a lived precept of caring requires that I, nurse, must always\r\nand ever regard the person nursed from a position of love. I must enter\r\nall nursing activity with the sole purpose of using truth, only and\r\never, to promote the spiritual growth of the person nursed. In this\r\nclimate of openness to myself and to the other, we can begin to\r\nexperience freedom from fear.\r\n\r\nJason inevitably opened his eyes only seconds or minutes later--I was so\r\nconcerned with the surgeon's directive that I lost perception of time.\r\nMy choice? The surgeon's choice? Jason's choice?\r\n\r\nAll too soon, before I could decide \"how\" to act, Jason had arrived at\r\nour moment of honesty versus dishonesty.\r\n\r\nThere were tears in Jason's eyes and as quickly as the endotrachial tube\r\nwas removed, words came from Jason's essence. \"Why me, God?\"\r\n\r\nI was pre-empted. (That's what happens when I write the script of\r\nnursing.)\r\n\r\nInstead of dancing around \"telling\" Jason, I was now only able to\r\n\"be-with\" Jason. To suffer with Jason, to come to compassionate knowing\r\nof Jason's subjective reality. \"I heard him,\" Jason choked and sobbed.\r\n\r\nI just sat next to his stretcher and held his left hand with my right\r\nhand. I softly stroked his shoulder. This intimate hand-in-hand gesture\r\nonly expressed a small part of the instant connectedness that we were\r\nco-experiencing, each alone, each with the other, all at once.\r\n\r\nI sat there for more than thirty minutes telling Jason repeatedly to\r\nrest, trust God to help him, have strength, courage, and hope.\r\n\r\nHaving come together, Jason and I, through the darkness of anesthetized\r\nsleep to the harsh reality of \"wakefulness,\" we both move on with our\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nI asked the surgeon of Jason several times, but he couldn't remember\r\nJason.\r\n\r\nI will never forget Jason. Jason brought me closer to understanding\r\nhonesty as caring (Little, 1992).\r\n\r\n\r\nAn explicit realization of nursing as a personal expression of caring\r\ncan fuel a commitment to growing in caring throughout life. A vivid,\r\narticulated sense of self connects with an equally strong and explicit\r\nsense of nursing, and a personal commitment to caring in and through\r\nnursing is created. Research makes the unequivocal point that those who\r\nseek our nursing service identify caring as the sine qua non of nursing\r\n(Samaral), 1988; Winland-Brown & Schoenhofer, 1992). Entering these\r\ncovenantal relationships obligates us to mutually live and grow in\r\ncaring. What has also become apparent through our practice is that it\r\nis increasingly difficult for nurses to conceptualize their service\r\nas caring. Many nurses have lost faith in themselves as persons\r\ncontributing caring in health service delivery situations. Thus, the\r\nraison d'être for the professional service career of nursing is lost,\r\nand nurses become disheartened.\r\n\r\nIt is our experience, as illustrated in the previous story, Honesty,\r\nthat nurses can recapture the spirit of nursing, can rekindle hope\r\nfor themselves as persons caring through and in nursing. The reader\r\nis invited to pause a moment and experience a sense of self as person\r\nexpressing caring in nursing. You are invited to enter a quiet,\r\ncontemplative inner space. Allow the attentions and distractions of the\r\nmoment to recede as you create quietude. Now, bring to life the most\r\nbeautiful nursing you have ever done. Recall that precious instance\r\nthat stands out for you as truly nursing. Savor the fullness of that\r\nexperience. Explore the meaning of this wonderful experience of nursing.\r\n\r\nIf possible, pause now and tell the story of your finest nursing\r\nmoment--aloud to another nurse, or in writing to the nurse you are today.\r\nShare your story and invite other nurses to share theirs with you.\r\n\r\nNow that the moment has been reborn and communicated, it is available as\r\na powerful resource for you. The essence of nursing which connects you\r\nto all others in nursing is also to be found here. In that story resides\r\nthe central meaning of nursing, available now for your inspiration and\r\nfor your study.\r\n\r\nFor many nurses, the practice of nursing as caring will require changes\r\nin the conceptualization of nursing and nursing practice structures.\r\nCertain ideologies and cognitive frameworks that have gained prominence\r\nin nursing in the recent past are not fully congruent with the values\r\nexpressed in the Nursing as Caring theory.\r\n\r\nFor example, the problem-solving process introduced into nursing by\r\nOrlando (1961), known as the Nursing Process, comes from a worldview\r\nthat is incompatible with that which undergirds nursing as caring. In\r\nthe 1960s, nurses came to value Orlando's Nursing Process for its role\r\nin helping them organize and put to use a growing body of scientific\r\nnursing knowledge. Having borrowed the \"problematizing\" approach to\r\nservice delivery that was so successful in medical contexts, the Nursing\r\nProcess also fit with an emerging documentation system known as Problem\r\nOriented Medical Records, which again was adapted from medicine for\r\nnursing use. During the late 1970s and through the 1980s, this impetus\r\nwas further developed in the Nursing Diagnosis movement.\r\n\r\nWhat difficulties exist with the problem-solving process in nursing?\r\nMore than anything else, this process directs nurses to locate something\r\nin the internal or external environment or character of the client that\r\nis in need of correction. Gadow (1984) refers to this view as a paradigm\r\nof philanthropy. In this demeaning paradigm, \"touch is a gift from one\r\nwho is whole to one who is not\" (p. 68). Within the context of Orlando's\r\nNursing Process, such problem solving requires that the nurse find\r\nsomething that needs correction to legitimately offer appropriate care.\r\nThis focus on correction--and cure--distracts nurses from their primary\r\nmission of caring and therefore practice results in objectification,\r\nlabeling, ritualism, and non-involvement. The context for nursing is\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nFurther, Orlando's Process has resulted in nursing's knowledge base\r\nbeing ever more deeply grounded in disciplines other than nursing.\r\nAn examination of a list of nursing diagnoses reveals that specific\r\nknowledge from disciplines such as medicine, psychology, anthropology,\r\nsociology, and epidemiology is what is required to solve the problems\r\nto which the diagnoses refer. Rather than leading nurses toward the\r\ndevelopment of the knowledge of nursing, Orlando's Nursing Process has\r\nintensified the concept of nursing as a context-free integrator of other\r\ndisciplines.\r\n\r\nThe following story of a nursing situation demonstrates the freedom and\r\ncreativity that is possible when the nurse takes a focused, unfolding\r\nview of the lived world of nursing. What occasioned this nursing\r\nrelationship was conceptualized in the larger system as providing care\r\nfor the caregiver, providing support in a family context. Here, home\r\nnursing is seen as once again on the ascendancy as nurses discover\r\nwhat is increasingly missing in institutional bureaucratic settings--the\r\nopportunity to nurse.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONNECTEDNESS\r\n\r\nI was with J. tonight, and for the first time I enjoyed \"authentic\r\npresence\" with her. I am not so sure it was because I was less fatigued\r\nand more receptive to \"what is\" in her home, but because J. was clearly\r\n\"different\" tonight. She greeted me with her usual rush of activity and\r\nthen startled me by asking me to \"be with me, please,\" when she gave her\r\nson an injection and changed the injection site on his central venous\r\ncatheter line. I had met her son before, but had never been invited to\r\nhis room or the upstairs quarters. We spent a long time in A's room\r\nwith J. and A. talking, sharing thoughts and feelings about (sister) K.,\r\nfrustrations of J. trying to do it all and still find a little peaceful\r\ntime for herself, angry outbursts and feelings of shame and sadness, and\r\nJ's desire to go to Mass on Sunday without feelings of extreme anger and\r\ndespair because K. cries when J. leaves the house, and ending with J's\r\nstated determination to do the impossible task of being all things to\r\nall people at all times. The dialogue was really between mother and son,\r\nwith questions directed toward me but immediately answered by J. and A.\r\nThe conversation was sparkling with humor and piercing with honesty, and\r\ncreated in mind's eye a rich, colorful mosaic of years of love, beauty,\r\nand truth. Tonight I wish I were an artist so I could capture this\r\nvision on canvas.\r\n\r\n1. asked me to stay with A. while she did a small chore in the kitchen,\r\nand I settled in a side chair for whatever might present itself. The\r\nI.V. pole in the corner of the room caught my attention and A. offered\r\nthe name of the drug and its purpose. I honestly did not know that\r\nparticular drug, and had nothing to offer, so I just nodded my head.\r\nA. looked at me, cleared his throat, and proceeded to tell me about a\r\nproblem he is encountering. I interrupted him and told him that I know\r\nnothing about him other than his name and he is J's son, and that J.\r\nhas not shared anything about him privately with me. He smiled, and then\r\nwith his head bowed and eyes peering at me, told me that he has\r\nAIDS, worries about the stigma, and dreads the stance most health\r\nprofessionals assume when he encounters them as they interpret the name\r\nof his disease process. I sat very still and nodded my head. I wanted to\r\nacknowledge his pain and show acceptance of him and what appeared to be\r\nhis need to connect with me. Together we reflected on the wonderfulness\r\nof the human spirit, the concept of personhood, and holistic beings with\r\nthoughts, feelings, wants, and needs. When A. was ready we ventured down\r\nthe stairs and found J. sitting quietly in a rocking chair. It seemed\r\nshe had finished her \"task,\" and I wondered how long she had been\r\nsitting alone. I sensed that she had invited me into her private pain,\r\nand courageously shared another part of her life with me. I also knew\r\nintuitively that she did not want to talk about it.\r\n\r\nJ. had prepared the piano, and all of them asked me to play for them and\r\nexpressed disappointment that I did not play the piano during my visit\r\nlast week. So I played gentle, reflective songs interspersed with light\r\nmelodic phrases. Requests were offered by each member of the family,\r\nand within minutes J. was sitting next to me on the piano bench, singing\r\nloudly and punctuating words with feelings and strength and lending\r\nincredible meaning to lyrics. \"Old Man River,\" deep, low, rumbling of\r\nthe piano and purposefully driving tempo was responded to in kind with\r\nJ. stamping her food with each beat and pounding her knee with each\r\nword as she emphatically sang \"He just keeps rolling along, he keeps on\r\nrolling along.\" It seemed to be cathartic for her as expressions seemed\r\nto come from the center of her being. We applauded ourselves when we\r\nfinished and J. let me hug her. A. caught my eye and mouthed \"thank\r\nyou for helping my mother to smile.\" J. was quiet then, and I felt her\r\nexhaustion. We agreed that it was time to close the piano for another\r\nweek, and I left. J. followed me to my car, and left me with \"God bless\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThis was an exhausting visit to J's home, yet it was even more\r\nenergizing because of the multiple caring moments I experienced with J.\r\nand her family. I have come to believe that caring moments are unique\r\nto each nursing situation and evolve naturally from the mutuality of\r\nauthentic presence as the fullness of the nurse's personhood blends\r\nwith the fullness of the other's personhood. Together they transcend the\r\nmoment. The caring moment is connectedness between nurse and other and\r\nboth experience moments of joy. (Kronk, 1992)\r\n\r\nTo characterize this nursing situation with a nursing diagnosis and to\r\nportray it as a linear process driven by the diagnosis or problem to be\r\naddressed with a pre-envisioned outcome would be to rob the situation\r\nof all the beauty of nursing. Because a story of a nursing situation\r\nis narrative, there is a temporal structure. However, this structure\r\nsupports rather than destroys the \"lived experience\" character of the\r\nsituation. The story of the nursing situation conveys the \"all-at-once\"\r\nas well as the unfolding. This approach permits us to conceptualize as\r\nwell as contextualize the knowledge of nursing the story tells. Through\r\nstory, the meaning for this nurse of knowing herself as caring person,\r\nas entering into the world of other(s) with authentic presence, is\r\nunderstood. The nurse knows other as caring person, and in that knowing\r\nattends to specific calls for caring with unique expressions of caring\r\nresponses created in the moment.\r\n\r\nThe Nursing as Caring theory, grounded in the assumption that all\r\npersons are caring, has as its focus a general call to nurture persons\r\nas they live caring uniquely and grow as caring persons. The challenge\r\nthen for nursing is not to discover what is missing, weakened, or\r\nneeded in another, but to come to know the other as caring person and to\r\nnurture that person in situation-specific, creative ways. We no longer\r\nunderstand nursing as a \"process,\" in the sense of a complex sequence of\r\npredictable acts resulting in some predetermined desirable end product.\r\nNursing is, we believe, processual, in the sense that it is always\r\nunfolding and that it is guided by intention.\r\n\r\nNursing is a professional service offered in social contexts, most often\r\nin bureaucratically organized health services. Discussions of health\r\nservices, overheard in boardrooms and legislative chambers, are\r\nlanguaged in impersonal, aggregate, disembodying, and perhaps more\r\nimportantly, economic terms. In contrast to the accepted ritualization\r\nof such language, nursing has a very important role to play--to bring the\r\nhuman, the personal dimension to health policy planning, and health\r\ncare delivery systems. Clearly, it is nursing knowledge itself, of human\r\nperson, of person as caring, that has been missing. While other groups\r\nrightly bring in knowledge of efficient operation and financing,\r\nnursing's contribution to the dialogue on effective care has the\r\npotential to remind all players of the real bottom line, the person\r\nbeing cared for. We must remember that in most industrialized countries\r\nhealth service is viewed as a commodity delivery system, an economic\r\nexchange of goods and services. While this is not the only context\r\nfor nursing, it is the most prevalent context. If nurses choose to\r\nparticipate in existing delivery systems, and most do, then ways must\r\nbe created that preserve the service of nursing while responding to the\r\nappropriate requirements of the system. Ultimately, this would require\r\nof nurses that they become skilled in articulating their service as\r\nnursing, and connecting that service to the recording and billing\r\nsystems in use. Although this same goal animated the nursing diagnosis\r\nmovement of the 1970s, within the terms of that movement, the result\r\nwas less than fortunate: nursing's effort to emulate the fee-for-service\r\nbilling practices of medicine failed, and nursing contributions were\r\nneither communicated nor reimbursed.\r\n\r\nWhen nurses tell the stories of their nursing situations, however, the\r\nservice of nursing becomes recognizable. The unique contribution that\r\nnurses make, expressed in the focus of nursing, emerges across settings.\r\nThe difference between a nursing story and a typical nursing case\r\nreport is striking; the first conveys the nursing care given, the second\r\nreports the medical-assisting activities performed by the nurse. We have\r\ndiscovered in our work with nurses that while nursing care is usually\r\ngiven, it is frequently neither acknowledged nor communicated.\r\n\r\nThe nurse practicing within the caring context described here will most\r\noften be interfacing with the health care system in two ways: first,\r\nto communicate nursing in ways that can be understood; and second, to\r\narticulate nursing service as a unique contribution within the system in\r\nsuch a way that the system itself grows to support nursing.\r\n\r\nThe concept of profession is involved in the practice of nursing as\r\ncaring. With the advent of the information and action technologies\r\nof the twenty-first century, the present concept of professions as\r\nrepositories of esoteric knowledge employed by social elites is rapidly\r\nbecoming outdated. As many nurses will attest, the patient often teaches\r\nthe nurse about new medical technologies and about the management of\r\nthem. In this regard, what will it mean, in the next century, to profess\r\nnursing? A renewed commitment to professional caring means that nurses\r\nwould seek connectedness in all collegial relationships as nurses are\r\nopen to discovering the unfolding meaning of human caring, with persons\r\nvalued as important in themselves. Therefore, nurses forfeit assuming\r\nauthoritative stances toward each other, the persons nursed, and other\r\nparticipants in the health care enterprise. More than ever, it will mean\r\nthat nurses will, in relation with others, live out the value of caring\r\nin everyday life. Thus, the organized nursing profession would assume\r\nresponsibility for developing and sharing knowledge of nurturing persons\r\nliving caring and growing in caring.\r\n\r\nThe following story of a nursing situation, told in the form of a\r\npoem, exemplifies the reconceptualization called for in the practice of\r\nNursing as Caring. In this situation, the nurse carried out a medically\r\nprescribed treatment, not as a form of medicine but as a form of\r\nnursing. The nurse communicates a knowing of the other as caring person,\r\nliving courage and hope in the face of pain and fear. This example\r\nillustrates the meaning of knowing as a caring ingredient (Mayeroff,\r\n1971), in the connectedness of the nurse with the patient.\r\n\r\nThe nurse's knowing both forms the intention to nurse and is formed by\r\nthe intention to know other as caring person and nurture caring. A\r\nmore typical recounting of this situation would focus on the specific\r\nprocedure of the treatment being applied, in terms of the condition of\r\nthe wound. In this poem, the nurse renders the meaning of nursing.\r\n\r\n          Heating--HIV +\r\n          Your wounds weeped\r\n          Purulent with the discharge of our\r\n          Pain and fear.\r\n          They tried to hide, only to reappear.\r\n          The treatment gentle, slow\r\n          A warm, loving balm to your soul.\r\n          Your stomach was fed the comfort\r\n          Food of your youth\r\n          And your lips drank in deeply all\r\n          You knew and understood.\r\n          The memories sweetened each moment\r\n          You stood, face to face with terror of\r\n          What might be mistook.\r\n          All inside shifted as slowly it came,\r\n          A gradual awakening; embracing of pain\r\n          As you conquered your demons\r\n          A lightness appeared\r\n          To stay forever and\r\n          Abolish all fears. (Wheeler, 1990)\r\n\r\n\r\nNURSING SERVICE ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\nMany of the nursing situations described in this book have taken\r\nplace in hospital settings, where the nursing service is a shared\r\nresponsibility of many nurses in a range of functional roles. Nurses\r\nin such settings generally nurse many persons intensively and\r\nsimultaneously and share direct nursing responsibility with one or\r\ntwo other nurses. How can nurses in institutional practice settings be\r\nsupported so that calls for nursing can be heard and nursing responses\r\nmade? What is the role of the nurse administrator in supporting the\r\npractice of nurses?\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand clearly the difference between the\r\npractice of administration which happens to be delivered by nurses\r\nand the practice of nursing administration. Tead (1951) defines\r\nadministration as \"the comprehensive effort to direct, guide, and\r\nintegrate associated human strivings which are focused toward some\r\nspecific ends or aims\" (p. 3). For example, goals of administration\r\ncould be business, governmental, education, or nursing. In this\r\ndefinition, it is evident that the focus must be made clear. It is not\r\nadequate to have an understanding of administration as a role which is\r\nfocused in functions such as interpersonal, informational, and\r\ndecisional. Such a perspective ignores the value of persons and the\r\nministering responsibilities inherent in the role. The administrator\r\nmust connect his or her work to the direct work of nursing.\r\n\r\nNursing administration by name suggests a groundedness in the\r\ndiscipline. The role of the nursing administrator could indeed be\r\nquestioned if the focus of the administrative practice is not nursing.\r\nThere is the assumption that the administration of nursing is practiced\r\nfrom a particular conception of nursing in which the focus or goal of\r\nnursing is clear. What the nursing administrator says and does as nurse\r\nmust reflect the uniqueness of the discipline so that nursing's unique\r\ncontributions are assured. Nursing administrators must also be able to\r\narticulate the unique contributions of nursing to other members of the\r\ninterdisciplinary health care team.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the nurse administrator's role to direct care is\r\nimplicit in this perspective. The nursing administrator describes him or\r\nherself as directly involved in the care of persons. All activities of\r\nthe nursing administrator are ultimately directed to the person(s)\r\nbeing nursed. It is essential that this direct connection to the goal\r\nof nursing be made and that persons assuming nursing administration\r\npositions be able to articulate their unique role contributions to\r\nnursing care. Without this clarity of focus, one may be engaged in the\r\npractice of administration but not nursing administration.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of nursing as caring, the nurse administrator makes\r\ndecisions through a lens in which the focus of nursing is nurturing\r\npersons as they live caring and grow in caring. All activities in\r\nthe practice of nursing administration are grounded in a concern for\r\ncreating, maintaining, and supporting an environment in which calls for\r\nnursing are heard and nurturing responses are given. From this point of\r\nview, the expectation arises that nursing administrators participate\r\nin shaping a culture that evolves from the values articulated within\r\nnursing as caring.\r\n\r\nAlthough often perceived to be \"removed\" from the direct care of the\r\nnursed, the nursing administrator is intimately involved in multiple\r\nnursing situations simultaneously, hearing calls for nursing and\r\nparticipating in responses to these calls. As calls for nursing are\r\nknown, one of the unique responses of the nursing administrator is to\r\ndirectly or indirectly enter the world of the nursed, understand special\r\ncalls when they occur, and assist in securing the resources needed\r\nby the nurse to nurture persons as they live and grow in caring. All\r\nnursing activities should be approached with this goal in mind. Here,\r\nthe nurse administrator reflects on the obligations inherent in the role\r\nin relation to the nursed. The presiding moral basis for determining\r\nright action is the belief that all persons are caring. Frequently,\r\nthe nurse administrator may enter the world of the nursed through\r\nthe stories of colleagues who are assuming other roles such as\r\nnurse manager. Policy formulation and implementation allow for the\r\nconsideration of unique situations. The nursing administrator assists\r\nothers within the organization to understand the focus of nursing and to\r\nsecure the resources necessary to achieve the goals of nursing. When the\r\nfocus of nursing can be clearly articulated, nursing's contribution\r\nto the whole will be understood, If the focus of practice is clouded,\r\nhowever, this becomes an insurmountable task. Recognition of nursing's\r\nvalue is contingent upon the ability of nurses to articulate their\r\ncontribution. Traditionally, systems define contribution through patient\r\noutcomes and other total quality measures. Future articulation of\r\nnursing and its contributions would emanate from the values and\r\nassumptions offered in the Nursing as Caring theory.\r\n\r\nSharing nursing situations with others is one way to promote the knowing\r\nof nursing. It also is a way for other members of the organization to\r\nsee how their roles contribute to the well-being of the nursed. The\r\nfollowing is a nursing situation, re-presented as the poem \"Last\r\nRights,\" that cries out for nursing administration, that is, nursing\r\nsupport for nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Last Rights\r\n\r\n          Tight faced, they found and cornered her at work\r\n          As quick as hammers pounding down a wall of\r\n          words came hard and nailed that little quirk of\r\n          honest so fast she held the rail.\r\n\r\n          \"Who were you to say he was a dying man,\r\n          though he lay white, his lifethread thin.\r\n          How were you to know the speed his flying heart\r\n          would race away from bone and shin.\r\n\r\n          He was hopeless, yes, beneath that tent of\r\n          filmy gauze, but who were you to say his fate\r\n          was hinged in prayer-our magic spent.\r\n          Who knows, he might have lived another day.\r\n\r\n          \"He held my hands, asked the truth,\" she said.\r\n          Then turned away to smooth the empty bed.\r\n\r\n                           --Yelland-Marino (1993)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nurse administrator can nurture the living in caring and growing in\r\ncaring of the person in this story by creating ways to support the\r\nnurse at the bedside in order that the call for hope of being known and\r\nsupported as caring person, not object, can occur. What are some of\r\nthe strategies that the nurse administrator could engage in which would\r\nreflect the nursing focus?\r\n\r\nBecause budget determination is such a prominent matter for nurse\r\nadministrators, we will begin there. Budget decisions should be directed\r\nfrom the perspective of what I ought to do as nurse administrator that\r\nwould have the greatest effect on nurturing persons being cared for in\r\ntheir living and growing in caring. One aspect of budget essential to\r\nthis story is time--time for the nurse to focus on knowing self and other\r\ncolleagues. As Paterson & Zderad (1988) state, for nursing practice to\r\nbe humanistic, awareness of self and others is essential. The budget\r\nshould include time allocations for staff to participate in dialogues\r\nfocused on knowing self as caring person in order that calls, such as\r\nthe one in the previous story, can be heard. The notion of dialogue is\r\ncentral to transforming ways of being with others in organizations. Bohm\r\n(1992) refers to dialogue as creating \"a flow of meaning in the whole\r\ngroup, out of which will emerge some new understanding, something\r\ncreative\" (p. 16). Persons engaged in dialogue are focused on trying to\r\nunderstand situations as perceived through another's eyes in order that\r\nnew possibilities may be recognized. Through the allocation of time,\r\nnursing staff come to better know self and other. Shared meanings\r\nemerge which become the \"glue or cement that holds people and societies\r\ntogether\" (p. 16). These opportunities for knowing self assist the\r\nnurse to achieve, as Tournier (1957) would put it, a reciprocity of\r\nconsciousness with other.\r\n\r\nThrough the opportunity to better know self as caring person, the nurse\r\nwill learn to intentionally and authentically enter nursing situations\r\nfocused on knowing and supporting the nursed as they live caring and\r\ngrow in caring. Time for reflection and collegial dialogue is necessary\r\nto maintain this nursing lens in a period of increasing responsibility.\r\nSuch time allocation communicates the commitment of the nurse\r\nadministrator to enhance the growth of the nurse in the discipline of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nTo propose that the budgeting of time is one of the most essential tasks\r\nof a nursing administrator may seem outrageously naïve in a time\r\nwhen organizations seem to be interested only in bottom-line figures.\r\nIronically, however, the time allocation strategy offered here supports\r\nthe goal of cost containment. Studies have shown that caring behaviors\r\nof nurses (Duffy, 1991) and nursing staff attitudes (Cassarea et al.,\r\n1986) are directly related to patient satisfaction. Benner and Wrubel\r\n(1989) also found that caring is integral to expert practice. As a\r\nresult, and from the standpoint of quality of care as revenue producing,\r\nthis strategy of allowing time for dialogue and reflection has merit.\r\n\r\nFrom the viewpoint of the Nursing as Caring theory, the nurse\r\nadministrators' beliefs about person would require that new ways\r\nof being with the nursed are created and supported. The nursing\r\nadministrator models a way of being with others that portrays respect\r\nfor person as caring. Through modeling, others grow in their competency\r\nto know and express caring. Of course creating and sustaining\r\nenvironments that nurture and value the practice and study of nursing\r\nremains the challenge facing nurses caught in the maze of various\r\norganizational structures. Systems tend to perpetuate existing ways of\r\nbeing even though their members may repeatedly question the legitimacy\r\nof actions flowing from these structures. It is our belief that\r\nnursing can create a culture that values caring within systems and\r\norganizations. Systems and organizations can be reshaped and transformed\r\nthrough living out the assumptions and values inherent within nursing as\r\ncaring.\r\n\r\nAssumptions on which Nursing as Caring is built serve as stabilizers for\r\nthe organization. These assumptions directly influence the climate of\r\nthe organization and serve as the organizational pillars. The climate of\r\norganizations is determined by beliefs and values of persons within it.\r\nAn organization grounded in the assumptions of person as described in\r\nChapter 1 would not support arbitrary and capricious decision making\r\nin which the input of all persons has not been discerned. Mission\r\nstatements, goals, objectives, standards of practice, policies and\r\nprocedures emerge from assumptions, beliefs, and values that emphasize\r\none's humanness. If one accepts the assumption that persons are\r\ncaring by virtue of their humanness, then it follows that cultures are\r\ncomprised of caring persons. Respect for person as person is engendered\r\nwithin this context. There is a desire to know and support the living of\r\ncaring; to support each other in being who we are as caring persons in\r\nthe moment. Therefore, assumptions of Nursing as Caring ground not only\r\nthe theory but may likewise influence the ontology of the organization\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nGenerally, organizational structures reflect bureaucratic values.\r\nStructures imply ways of being with and relating to people. The process\r\nof relating is typically illustrated in a hierarchical fashion. The\r\nconcept of hierarchy carries with it the notion that there is a\r\n\"top\" and a \"bottom.\" Competition, levels, and positions of power\r\nare implicit. In climbing the rungs of a bureaucratic ladder, it is\r\ndifficult for the employee to be authentic and valued as a unique person\r\nwith special ideas because the risks of such valuing are often too great\r\nfor the bureaucracy to bear. Competition too remains the driving force\r\nof most organizations.\r\n\r\nWithin an organization, however, we can imagine each person's hands as\r\nclinging to the rungs of the bureaucratic ladder. Taken further, this\r\nimage would clearly portray persons who are not and can not be open to\r\nreceive and know other. Because of the vertical axis of the bureaucratic\r\nhierarchy, persons, more often than not, are viewed as objects. The\r\nladder positions people so that they are either looking up or down but\r\nrarely eye-to-eye. Obviously, the hierarchical model does not support\r\nthe idea of each person as important in and to him or herself.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, and from the assumptions posited in Nursing as Caring, the\r\nmodel for being in relationships resembles a dance of caring persons\r\n(Boykin, 1990). The same persons are present in this circle that were in\r\nthe hierarchical structure described above. The difference between the\r\ntwo models is the philosophical way of being with other. Because the\r\nnature of relating in the circle is grounded in a respect for and\r\nvaluing of each person, the way of being is diametrically opposed to\r\ntraditional patterns of relating in organizations. Leaving the security\r\nprovided by known hierarchical structures, however, requires courage,\r\ntrust, and humility. Building on the assumptions of this theory, one can\r\ninfer that the basic dance of all persons in relationships is to know\r\nself and other as caring person. Each person is encouraged and supported\r\nin a culture that values person-as-person, person as caring.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dancing Circle]\r\n\r\nThe image of a dancing circle is also used to describe being for and\r\nbeing with the nursed. In the circle, all persons are committed to\r\nknowing self and other as living and growing in caring. Each dancer\r\nmakes a distinct contribution because of the role assumed. The dancers\r\nin the circle do not necessarily connect by holding hands although they\r\nmay. Each dancer moves within this dance as called forth by the nature\r\nof the nursing situation. The nursed calls for services of particular\r\ndancers at various points in time. Each person is in this circle because\r\nof their unique contribution to the person being cared for ... nurses,\r\nadministrators, human resources, etc. These roles would not exist if it\r\nwere not for the nursed. There is always room for another person to join\r\nthe dance. Rather than the vertical view described earlier, this model\r\nfosters knowing other. Eye-to-eye contact assists one to know and\r\nappreciate each other as caring persons. Each person is viewed as\r\nspecial and caring. No one person's role is more or less important than\r\nthe other's. Each role is essential in contributing to the process of\r\nliving grounded in caring. As each person authentically expresses their\r\ncommitment in being there for and with the nursed, caring relationships\r\nare lived. When the focus in any health care institution fails to be\r\nthe person cared-for, purpose, roles, and responsibilities become\r\ndepersonalized and bureaucratic rather than person-centered and caring.\r\n\r\nPersonal knowing--knowing of self and other--is integral to the\r\nconnectedness of persons in this dance. The nursing administrator\r\ninterfaces with persons of many disciplines as well as with the nursed.\r\nWith each interaction, the nurse administrator is honest and authentic\r\nin encouraging others to know and live out who they are. Each encounter\r\nwith another is an opportunity for knowing other as caring person.\r\nFrom an organizational standpoint the nursing administrator assists\r\nin creating a community that appreciates, nurtures, and supports each\r\nperson as they live and grow in caring moment to moment. The nursing\r\nadministrator assists nurses to hear and understand the unique calls for\r\nnursing and supports and sustains their nurturing response.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Benner, P, & Wrubel, J.

The assumptions that ground Nursing as Caring\r\nalso ground the practice of nursing education and nursing education\r\nadministration. The structure and practices of the education program\r\nare expressions of the discipline and, therefore, should be explicit\r\nreflections of the values and assumptions inherent in the statement of\r\nfocus of the discipline. From the perspective of Nursing as Caring, all\r\nstructures and activities should reflect the fundamental assumption that\r\npersons are caring by virtue of their humanness. Other assumptions and\r\nvalues reflected in the education program include: knowing the person as\r\nwhole and complete in the moment and living caring uniquely; understand\r\nthat personhood is a process of living grounded in caring and is\r\nenhanced through participation in nurturing relationships with caring\r\nothers; and, finally, affirming nursing as a discipline and profession.\r\n\r\nThe curriculum, the foundation of the education program, asserts the\r\nfocus and domain of nursing as nurturing persons living caring and\r\ngrowing in caring. All activities of the program of study are directed\r\ntoward developing, organizing, and communicating nursing knowledge, that\r\nis, knowledge of nurturing persons living caring and growing in caring.\r\n\r\nThe model for organizational design of nursing education is analogous\r\nto the dancing circle described earlier. Members of the circle include\r\nadministrators, faculty, colleagues, students, staff, community, and the\r\nnursed. What this circle represents is the commitment of each dancer to\r\nunderstanding and supporting the study of the discipline of nursing. The\r\nrole of administrator in the circle is more clearly understood when the\r\norigin of the word is reflected upon. The term administrator is derived\r\nfrom the Latin ad ministrare, to serve (Guralnik, 1976). This definition\r\nconnotes the idea of rendering service. Administrators within the circle\r\nare by nature of role obligated to ministering, to securing and to\r\nproviding resources needed by faculty, students, and staff to meet\r\nprogram objectives. Faculty, students, and administrators dance together\r\nin the study of nursing. Faculty support an environment that values\r\nthe uniqueness of each person and sustains each person's unique way\r\nof living and growing in caring. This process requires trust, hope,\r\ncourage, and patience. Because the purpose of nursing education is to\r\nstudy the discipline and practice of nursing, the nursed must be in the\r\ncircle. The community created is that of persons living caring in the\r\nmoment, each person valued as special and unique.\r\n\r\nWe have said in Chapter 1 that the domain of a discipline is that which\r\nits members assert. The statement of focus that directs the study of\r\nnursing from this theoretical perspective is that of nurturing persons\r\nas they live caring and grow in caring. The study of nursing is\r\napproached through the use of nursing situations. The knowledge of\r\nnursing resides in the nursing situation and is brought to life through\r\nstudy. The nursing situation is a shared lived experience in which the\r\ncaring between the nurse and the one nursed enhances personhood or the\r\nprocess of living grounded in caring. These situations, like the many\r\ncited in earlier chapters, become available for study through the use of\r\nstory (recounting the situation in ways that convey the essence of the\r\nlived experience). These stories create anew the lived experience of\r\ncaring between the nurse and the nursed, and bring to life the basic\r\nvalues described in Chapter 1.\r\n\r\nStory then becomes the method for studying and knowing nursing. Carper's\r\n(1978) four patterns of knowing serve as an organizing framework for\r\nasking epistemological questions of caring in nursing. Those patterns\r\ninclude personal, ethical, empirical, and aesthetic knowing. Each of\r\nthese patterns comes into play as one strives to understand the whole of\r\nthe situation. Personal knowing centers on knowing and encountering self\r\nand other, empirical knowing addresses the science of caring in nursing,\r\nethical knowing focuses on what \"ought to be\" in nursing situations,\r\nand aesthetic knowing is the integration and synthesis of all knowing\r\nas lived in a particular situation. The poem, \"Intensive Care,\" a\r\nrepresentation of a nursing situation, is given here to illustrate the\r\norganization of sample content.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    INTENSIVE CARE\r\n                       (centered)\r\n\r\n        Did you see nurse that you can know me--\r\n        The part that is me, my mind and soul is in my eyes\r\n        These tubes that are everywhere-that is not me.\r\n        The one in my throat is the worse of all--\r\n        Now my whole being, the essence of me I\r\n        must reflect\r\n        through my hands but they are tied down,\r\n        movements\r\n        of my head but did you realize that\r\n        uncomfortable for me\r\n        or through my eyes and you do not notice them--\r\n        except once today during my bath.\r\n        You speak to me and look at the tubes--\r\n        Don't you know my thoughts are all over my face\r\n        Don't you realize your thoughts are on your face--\r\n        In your touch and your tone of voice.\r\n        I wrote a request on paper and you said \"I'll take care\r\n        Of it for you\" your tone said \"Why can't this\r\n        woman\r\n        Do anything for herself?\"\r\n        You positioned your hand to count my pulse but I\r\n        Can't say you touched me-you wouldn't hold my\r\n        hand that I may touch you.\r\n        You walked in for the first time today with a grin\r\n        on your face but your mouth is now tight\r\n        you grimaced a lot as you bathed me.\r\n        Don't you see nurse that you can know me--I'm not\r\n        A chart or tubes of medication, monitors or all\r\n        the other things you look at so intensely--I'm\r\n        more than that\r\n        I'm scared--just look in my eyes.\r\n                          --S. Carr, 1991\r\n\r\n\r\nCarper's (1978) patterns of knowing offer a framework for organizing the\r\ncontent for studying this nursing situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONAL KNOWING\r\n\r\n  Who are the nurse and nursed as caring persons in the moment?\r\n  How are the nurse and nursed expressing caring in this moment?\r\n  What is the meaning of this situation to the nurse and nursed in\r\n       terms of present realities and future possibilities?\r\n  What is the meaning of vulnerability and mortality?\r\n  What is the value of intuition in practice?\r\n  Empirical Knowing\r\n  What nursing and related research exists on modes of communication,\r\n        the meaning of presence in practice, touch, objectification,\r\n        recovery of cardiac patients, technological caring,\r\n        understanding the experience of fear and loneliness?\r\n  What factual knowledge is needed to be competent in this particular\r\n        situation--e.g. knowledge of monitors, chest tubes,\r\n         medications, cardiac care, diagnostic data?\r\n\r\n\r\nETHICAL KNOWING\r\n\r\n  If nursing is practiced from the perspective of Nursing as Caring,\r\n        what obligations are inherent in this situation?\r\n  How is the nurse demonstrating the value that all persons are caring?\r\n        Respect for person-as-person? Interconnectedness?\r\n  What dilemmas are present in this story?\r\n\r\n\r\nAESTHETIC KNOWING\r\n\r\n  How is the nursed supported to live dreams of living and growing in caring?\r\n  How could the nurse transcend the moment to create possibilities\r\n        within this specific nursing situation?\r\n  What metaphors might express the meaning of this nursing situation?\r\n\r\n\r\nStudents studying this nursing situation are challenged to know the\r\nperson as caring, as living caring uniquely in the moment, as having\r\nhopes and dreams for growing in caring, and as being whole or complete\r\nin the moment. The student is also challenged to know the nurse as\r\ncaring person in the moment and to project ways of supporting the nurse\r\nas caring person.\r\n\r\nThrough the study of this situation, students and faculty identify\r\na range of calls for nursing as well as nurturing responses. In this\r\nprocess, there is dialogue focused on knowing the nurse and nursed in\r\nthe story as caring person. We would contribute the following as our\r\nknowing of the nursed as caring person. Through her honest expression of\r\n\"I'm scared--just look in my eyes,\" we know her as living hope, honesty,\r\nand transcending fear through courage.\r\n\r\nCalls for nursing might include a call to be known as caring person and\r\na call to have interconnectedness recognized and affirmed. The nurse's\r\nresponse to these calls is individual and evolves from who one is as\r\nperson and nurse. Therefore, the range of responses is multiple and\r\nvaried--each reflecting the nurse's informed living of caring in the\r\nmoment. Each nurturing response is focused on nurturing the person as\r\nhe or she lives caring and expresses hopes and dreams for growing in\r\ncaring.\r\n\r\nIf the nurse is responding to the call of the person for recognition\r\nand affirmation of interconnectedness, perhaps the nurse would express\r\nhearing this call by being present with the intention of knowing\r\nother as caring person. This may be communicated through active\r\npatience--giving the other time and space to be known; through touch\r\nwhich communicates respect and interconnectedness; through the nurse\r\nsharing who he or she is as caring person in this relationship--perhaps\r\nthrough tears as the resonance of commonality of this experience is\r\nknown; through music or poetry if a shared love of these has been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nThrough dialogue, students and faculty openly engage in the study of\r\nnursing. The dialogue encourages and supports students and faculty to\r\nfreely express who they are as person and nurse living caring through\r\nthe re-presented story. It provides an opportunity to affirm values\r\nof self and discipline and to study how these values may be lived in\r\npractice. It is in this dialogue of nursing that faculty communicate\r\ntheir love for nursing. Time is needed for both faculty and students\r\nto reflect on the meaning of being a member of this discipline and more\r\nspecifically, on the meaning of being a member of a discipline\r\nfocused on nurturing persons as they live and grow in caring. Dialogue\r\nfacilitates the integration of this understanding and is a key concept\r\nin present and future transformations of nursing education. Common\r\nengagement in dialogue as nursing stories are shared and studied is the\r\nway of being.\r\n\r\nThe story lived anew provides students the opportunity to participate\r\nin a lived experience of nursing and to create new possibilities. Since\r\nnursing can only occur through intentionality and authentic presence\r\nwith the nursed, students and faculty share how they prepare to enter\r\nthe world of the nursed, and how they come to understand that world.\r\nThis process requires that students be encouraged to live fully their\r\npersonhood. To facilitate such living, faculty support an environment in\r\nwhich students are free to choose and to express self in various ways.\r\nFor example, perhaps the holistic understanding of a nursing situation\r\nwould be expressed as aesthetic knowing through dance, poetry, music,\r\npainting, or the like. We view this process of education as critical to\r\nmoral education. When students enter nursing situations to know other as\r\nliving and growing in caring, they are living out the moral obligation\r\nthat arises from the commitment to know person as caring. Here, then,\r\nis an expression of a dynamic view of morality in which caring is always\r\nlived in the moment.\r\n\r\nIn the study of the situation, Intensive Care, brought to the dialogue\r\nare personal experiences of being alone, being afraid, and being with\r\nsomeone and not being heard or seen as caring person. This\r\npersonal knowing fosters human awareness of our connectedness and\r\ninterdependence. In this context, the nurse does not study the empirics\r\nof cardiac pathology to understand a perceived deficit but rather to\r\nbecome competent in drawing forth the knowledge that is specific to\r\nknowing this person as whole in the moment. The nurse comes to know\r\nthe person as living caring and growing in caring, situated within\r\na particular set of circumstances, some of which the nurse knows\r\nexplicitly. Each student entering the nursing situation will ask,\r\n\"How can I nurture this person in living and growing in caring in\r\nthis situation?\" Because each nurse may hear calls for caring in many\r\ndifferent ways, nursing responses are many and varied. For nursing\r\nfaculty, openness to multiple possibilities presents a particular\r\nchallenge and an opportunity to suspend entrenched patterns of teaching\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nFaculty and students study nursing together. Faculty join students in a\r\nconstant search to discover the content and meaning of the discipline.\r\nUndoubtedly, this understanding of extant possibilities presents a\r\ndifferent view of the role of teacher. Yet, it is a view that engenders\r\nthe sort of humility essential to nursing for there is always more\r\nto know. Although past methods of teaching of nursing may have been\r\ncomfortably structured through textbooks organized around medical\r\nscience, faculty are now empowered to question what should be the focus\r\nof study in the discipline of nursing. Faculty are encouraged to take\r\nrisks and let go of the familiar. The perspective that Nursing as Caring\r\nconveys--the fullness and richness of nursing--will allow faculty to\r\nwillingly assume the risks inherent in a new way of guiding the study of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nIn teaching Nursing as Caring, faculty assist students to come to know,\r\nappreciate, and celebrate self and other as caring person. Mayeroff's\r\nOn Caring (1971) provides a context for the generic knowing of self as\r\ncaring. Through dyads or small groups, students share life situations\r\nin which they experienced knowing self and other as caring person.\r\nMayeroff's caring ingredients (knowing, alternating rhythm, trust,\r\nhonesty, hope, courage, humility, patience) also serve as a source for\r\nreflection as one asks \"who am I as caring person?\". As students engage\r\nin this exercise, their emerging reflections begin to ground them as\r\nthey grow in their understanding of person as they live and grow in\r\ncaring. Students will also draw on the knowledge gleaned in the study\r\nof arts and humanities as they attempt to gain a deeper understanding of\r\nperson. The process of knowing self and other as caring is lifelong. In\r\nan educational program grounded in Nursing as Caring, however, the focus\r\non personal knowing (in the study for every nursing situation) provides\r\na deliberate opportunity for greater knowing of self and other as caring\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nStudents, as well as faculty, are in a continual search to discover\r\ngreater meaning of caring as uniquely expressed in nursing; journaling\r\nis an approach that facilitates this search. For example, in a special\r\nform of journaling, students actively dialogue with authors whose works\r\nthey are reading and with the ideas expressed in their works. This\r\nprocess enhances the students' understanding of caring in nursing.\r\nOver time, students integrate and synthesize many ideas and create new\r\nunderstandings. Examination is another process to facilitate learning.\r\nFrom this theoretical perspective, essay examinations that present\r\nnursing situations provide opportunities for students to express their\r\nknowledge of nurturing persons living and growing in caring. Aesthetic\r\nprojects also allow the student the opportunity to communicate\r\nunderstanding of a nursing situation. We would like to share with you\r\na project from a course in which the students were asked to express the\r\nbeauty of a nursing situation. In this nursing situation, the nurse,\r\nMichelle, shared her gifts of therapeutic touch and voice as expressions\r\nof caring for David in the moment, drawing on an earlier dialogue in\r\nwhich David told her of his love of meditation and the Ave Maria, she\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n                AVE MARIA\r\n          AND THERAPEUTIC TOUCH\r\n                FOR DAVID\r\n\r\n          \"David, let me know your pain;\r\n          From fractured leg and heart,\r\n          Share with me your private hell.\r\n          Next to one who's far,\r\n          Far away his own world:\r\n          Moaning, crying, weak.\r\n          What's it like to lie beside\r\n          One who cannot speak?\r\n\r\n          \"Tell me David, what you do\r\n          To cancel out the sound;\r\n          Eliminate the smell of dung\r\n          In which your roommate's found?\r\n          Who can you complain about?\r\n          Are you worse off than he?\r\n          Tied to IV, traction lines\r\n          You cannot be free.\r\n\r\n          \"David, I can see your pain.\r\n          Tell me where you are.\r\n          Tied in bed. Powerless.\r\n          From loved ones you're apart.\r\n          I can't move you from this place\r\n          To take your pain away.\r\n          But let me lay my hands on you\r\n          And sing to you today.\"\r\n\r\n          Ave Marie, gratia plena\r\n          Maria, gratia plena.\r\n          Ave dominus, dominus tecum.\r\n          Benedicta to in mulieribus.\r\n          Et benedictus\r\n          Et benedictus, fructus ventris;\r\n          Ventris tui, Jesu.\r\n          Ave Maria\r\n\r\n          I sang the song he loved and used\r\n          To meditate and flee,\r\n          Escape tormenting stimuli.\r\n          He needed to be freed,\r\n          To understand why he must bear\r\n          This trial, this hell, this pain,\r\n          I sang the tune; I touched with care\r\n          To give him peace again.\r\n\r\n                        --Stobie, 1991\r\n\r\n\r\nExpressions of nursing such as this, which was partly sung, beautifully\r\nportray the living of caring between the nurse and the nursed and\r\nexemplify how caring enhances personhood. Faculty play a vital role in\r\nfostering in students the courage to take such risks. Faculty encourage\r\nself-affirmation in students, open, nonjudgmental dialogue, living the\r\ncaring ideal in the classroom and development of the students' moral\r\ngroundedness in caring (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1990). Faculty also take\r\nthe risk of sharing self through their stories of nursing. The sharing\r\nof nursing situations is, in essence, a sharing of our innermost core\r\nof common identity and forms a type of collegiality among those who are\r\nstudying the discipline together.\r\n\r\nHow can faculty be supported to teach nursing in new ways? The\r\nadministrator of the program fosters a culture in which the study of\r\nthe discipline from the caring perspective, as presented here, can be\r\nachieved freely and fully. All actions of the dean are directed toward\r\ncreating, maintaining, and supporting this goal. The theoretical\r\nassumptions ground the activities of the dean in both internal and\r\nexternal areas of responsibility.\r\n\r\nInternally, the administrator, faculty, staff, and students model\r\ncommitment by creating an environment that fosters the knowing, living,\r\nand growing of persons in caring. The dean \"ministers\" by assuring that\r\nfaculty, students, and staff are presented ongoing opportunities to\r\nknow themselves ontologically as caring persons and professionals and\r\nto understand how caring orders their lives. Who we are as person\r\ninfluences who we are as student, colleague, nurse, scholar, and\r\nadministrator. Therefore, attention must be directed to knowing self.\r\nTime must be devoted to knowing and experiencing our humanness.\r\n\r\nThe constant struggle to know self and other as caring person nourishes\r\nour knowing of the nursed. Through constant discovery of self, the other\r\nis also continually discovered. This culture sensitizes each person\r\nto ways of being with other that necessitate that each action reflect\r\nrespect for person as person. Therefore, when issues are to be\r\naddressed, they are addressed openly and fully. Persons are encouraged\r\nto bring forth who they are so there is congruence between actions and\r\nfeelings. Understanding each other's views is essential to the unfolding\r\nof this culture. Dialogue assists one to know the other's needs and\r\ndesires, and to image oneself in the other's place. As such, the dean,\r\nfaculty, staff, and students become skilled in the use of the caring\r\ningredients, internalized as personally valid ways of expressing caring:\r\nknowing, alternating rhythms, trust, hope, courage, honesty, humility,\r\nand patience (Mayeroff, 1971).\r\n\r\nOf utmost importance in fostering this culture are decisions regarding\r\nselection of faculty. Although many prospective faculty have a fairly\r\ntraditional lens for the study of nursing (that is, the lens of medical\r\nscience or frameworks borrowed from other disciplines), this actually\r\nbecomes an insignificant factor in the process of selection. At the\r\nheart of choosing new faculty is knowing their passion for and love of\r\nnursing. A focus of the interview process is discerning the person's\r\ndevotion to the discipline. It is our belief that this attitude, this\r\nlove of nursing, is the music for the dancers in the circle. One way\r\nto know if prospective faculty love nursing is to ask them to share\r\na significant story from practice. Having faculty share a story\r\nilluminates their conceptualization of the discipline. Many faculty who\r\nhave not had the opportunity to teach nursing through an articulated\r\nnursing lens, can yet communicate nursing clearly through story.\r\n\r\nFaculty are supported in their struggles to conceptualize nursing in\r\na new way. Forums in which faculty come together and aesthetically\r\nre-present and share their nursing story is one strategy that\r\neffectively engages self and other in the knowing of nursing. It is also\r\na wonderful way to orient faculty as to how to use nursing situations to\r\nteach nursing. Faculty support each other as colleagues in learning\r\nto teach nursing in a new way, in becoming expert in the practice of\r\nnursing education, and in living out the basic assumptions of this\r\ntheory. This need for support holds true not only for faculty-faculty\r\nrelationships but for all relationships. The comfort of faculty teaching\r\nnursing from the perspective of Nursing as Caring is enhanced as the\r\nvalue of knowing other as caring, as living our histories and as having\r\nspecial nursing stories to share is appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe administrator, faculty, and staff assist in fostering an environment\r\nthat furthers the development of the students' capacity to care.\r\nCompetency in caring is a goal of the educational process. Students are\r\ncontinually guided to know self and other as caring person as faculty\r\nand administrators model actions that reflect respect for person as\r\nperson. Each student is known as caring person, as special and unique.\r\nPolicies allow for consideration of individual situations and diverse\r\npossibilities. In this culture, the dean and faculty attempt to know the\r\nstudent as caring person and student of the discipline. The intention of\r\nthe dean to know students in this way can be evident through invitations\r\nfor regularly scheduled dialogue in which students share openly their\r\nconceptions about nursing. The administrator is truly with students to\r\nknow them as caring persons and to hear from them their understanding of\r\nnursing as caring.\r\n\r\nExternally, the dean \"ministers\" to faculty, students, and staff through\r\nsecuring resources necessary to accomplish program goals. The dean\r\narticulates to persons in the academic and broader community their\r\nrole in the dance of nursing. The role of these persons is to provide\r\nresources such as scholarships, faculty development possibilities,\r\nlearning resources, and research monies. Although this may be a primary\r\nresponsibility of the dean by nature of the role, all persons in the\r\ncircle share in this process by virtue of their commitment to nursing.\r\n\r\nThe administrator brings to the circle a skillful use of the caring\r\ningredients. Alternating rhythms are used to understand and appreciate\r\neach person's unique contributions that support the achievement of\r\nprogram goals. For example, the budgetary process is essential to\r\ncreating an environment that reflects the valuing of nursing. Commitment\r\nof the dean to securing resources necessary to accomplish the program\r\ngoals drives the budget rather than the budget driving the commitment.\r\nThe administrator's devotion to the discipline and to the basic\r\nassumptions of the theory direct all activities. The administrator makes\r\ndecisions that reflect the basic beliefs of this theory. All decisions\r\nwould ultimately be made from this standpoint: \"What action should\r\nI take as administrator which would support the study of nursing as\r\nnurturing persons living in caring and growing in caring?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we have tried to suggest here is that every aspect of nursing\r\neducation is grounded in the values and assumptions inherent in this\r\ntheoretical focus. Thus, not only is the curriculum a direct expression\r\nof Nursing as Caring, but all aspects of program are similarly grounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Boykin, A., & Schoenhofer, S. (1990).

We initially introduced our perspective\r\nof nursing as discipline and profession in Chapter 1 and as a grounding\r\ncontext for the theory. As a discipline, nursing is a way of knowing,\r\nbeing, valuing, a way of living humanely, connected in oneness with\r\nothers, living caring and growing in caring. The unity nursing offers\r\nis known in human experience through personal, empirical, ethical, and\r\naesthetic realms.\r\n\r\nScience has to do with knowing and that which is known. Philosophers of\r\nscience are concerned with valid ways of knowing and ways of validating\r\nthat which is known. Human science is described by scholars in various\r\nways, each emphasizing particular values but all connecting to a common\r\nunderstanding that human science is concerned with knowing the world\r\nof human experience. A committed inquiry into human experience seems to\r\ncall forth certain values related to the meaning of being human.\r\nHerein lies the fundamental difference between formal science and human\r\nscience, as we perceive it. Formal science, that which is practiced in\r\nthe natural sciences and other sciences that emulate them, is modeled\r\non the structure of mathematics. Mathematics is a highly lawful science\r\nthat has contributed enormous social benefits over time. However,\r\nformal science grounded in mathematics and languaged as calculus is an\r\ninappropriate approach to the study of person-as-person. A perspective\r\nthat addresses the phenomenon of person-as-person is grounded in central\r\nvalues such as caring, freedom, and creativity. Methods to study person\r\nmust be similarly grounded.\r\n\r\nWe have come to understand that valid ways of knowing nursing and\r\nlegitimate warrants for nursing knowledge are discovered from within\r\nthe study of nursing itself; that is, within the study of the nursing\r\nsituation. The manner in which certain disciplines are conceptualized,\r\nespecially those dealing in normative contexts, calls for a dialectical\r\nform of sciencing, comparing, and contrasting. However, coming to know\r\nnursing is a dialogical process--direct engagement with the \"word of\r\nnursing.\" Nursing science must be contextual; the decontextualized\r\nmethodology of formal science, while essential for certain disciplines,\r\ncannot reveal direct knowledge of nursing. Because of the nature\r\nof nursing, nursing science must permit intentionality, intimacy,\r\nmutuality, and particularity.\r\n\r\nHuman science has understanding as its goal, with the definite\r\nexpectation that understanding is in the moment only (Watson, 1988; Van\r\nManen, 1990). In addition, the nature of nursing praxis does not\r\nrequire knowledge for the purpose of control, but for enlightenment,\r\nmoment-to-moment and reflectively. The nurse seeks knowledge neither to\r\ncontrol one's own behavior or that of the nursed. If it were otherwise,\r\nthe nurse would become his or her own prisoner, and would relate to\r\nthe other as dominator rather than caring nurse. The concept of the\r\nhermeneutic circle informs our understanding of the nature of nursing as\r\na human science. This circle of understanding, really a sphere more\r\nthan a uni-dimensional circle, is a heuristic device which directs our\r\nattention. As attention pauses at any aspect of the nursing situation,\r\nwe must attend to other aspects and to the whole of the nursing\r\nsituation to create useful understanding. One hermeneutist has pointed\r\nout that the circle brings us further along, not the issue at hand\r\n(Droysen, 1988). This distinction points to the human science position\r\nthat understanding is not constituted through analysis of facts but\r\nthrough dialogue with text and context. That is, what moves within the\r\ncircle is the seeker, rather than that which is sought, so that many\r\naspects are illuminated in context, and understanding grows. The\r\nhermeneutic circle requires that what we note in our inquiry remains\r\ncontextualized, developing \"new and ever new circles\" (Boeckh, 1988).\r\nThis is in contrast to normal science that requires an external referent\r\nfor objects of study in order to avoid circular thinking. Heidegger\r\n(1988), for example, contrasts the vicious circle of normal science\r\n(tautology) with the circle of hermeneutic: \" . . . in the circle is\r\nhidden a positive possibility of the most primordial kind of knowing\"\r\n(p. 225). We would propose that valid knowing in nursing is that which\r\nis known from within the circle.\r\n\r\nWhile the work of several scholars has influenced our understanding\r\n(e.g., Gadamer, 1989; Van Manen, 1990; Ray, 1994; Reeder, 1988),\r\nMacdonald's (1975) interpretation from the field of humanistic\r\neducation is especially meaningful. He explains hermeneutic knowing\r\nmethodologically as \"circular rather than linear in that the\r\ninterpretation of meaning in hermeneutic understanding depends on a\r\nreciprocal relation\" (p. 286) rather than on a fixed normative reference\r\npoint. The hermeneutic circle models the idea of reciprocal relation,\r\nbut Macdonald goes further to call for a self-reflective science that\r\nwill \"transcend problems of monological and hermeneutic meaning\" (p.\r\n287). The nature of nursing as expressed in the Nursing as Caring theory\r\nis a reciprocal relation, one characterized by its grounding in person\r\nas caring, and as persons connected in oneness in caring. Sciencing in\r\nnursing from this perspective must go beyond linearity to encompass the\r\ndialogic circling involved in the nursing situation. This places the\r\ndiscipline of nursing among the human sciences, and calls for methods\r\nof inquiry that assure the circle or dialogue, and further, fully\r\naccommodate that which can be known of nursing.\r\n\r\nNursing is properly catalogued as one of the human sciences for\r\nmany reasons. The most basic reason is that the discipline and the\r\ndisciplined practice of nursing directly involve persons in the fullness\r\nof their humanness. From our perspective, this means person as caring.\r\nPerson as caring implies person in community, connected in oneness\r\nwith others and with the universe, person freely choosing the living of\r\nvalues which are expressions of caring. This nursing ontology requires\r\nan epistemology consonant with human science values and methods. To know\r\nof, through and with nursing necessitates methods and techniques that\r\nhonor freedom, creativity, and interconnectedness.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 4, we asserted that nursing knowledge is created and\r\ndiscovered within and from within the nursing situation. (Nursing\r\nsituation, you may recall, is understood as a shared lived experience\r\nin which the caring between the nurse and the one nursed enhances\r\npersonhood.) Therefore, because the locus of nursing inquiry is the\r\nnursing situation, the systematic study of nursing calls for a new\r\nmethodology that recognizes that fact.\r\n\r\nCertainly, we acknowledge that something useful for nursing can be\r\nlearned through existing methodologies, from both natural and human\r\nscience traditions. For example, an experimental design can produce\r\ninformation about the effectiveness of a given clinical technique within\r\na specified range of use (e.g., placement of an oral thermometer). Such\r\ninformation can be important and useful to the work of the nurse and\r\nuseful to the client of nursing. It tells us nothing, however, of\r\nnursing. In fact, the central tenet underlying measurement in normal\r\nscience directly contradicts the central tenet of human science: created\r\nversus creating. Thus, the fullness of the nursing situation is not\r\namenable to study by measurement techniques. Yet, aspects of the nursing\r\nsituation can be abstracted and studied as variables in relation to\r\nother variables. This does not, however, yield knowledge of the nursing\r\nsituation in its fullest. At best, measurement approaches can call\r\nattention to an aspect so that it can be considered within the\r\nunfolding.\r\n\r\nPhenomenology, on the other hand, offers an example of an orientation\r\nand methodology that more closely approximates what is needed in a\r\nnursing method of inquiry. Phenomenology is an orientation toward\r\ninquiry that may be actualized through any one of a number of generic\r\napproaches, but is generally understood as the study of lived experience\r\n(e.g., Van Manen, 1990; Oiler, 1986). When the phenomenon conceptualized\r\nfor study is representative of the nursing situation, nursing may be\r\nknown. That is, new nursing knowledge may eventuate. New understanding\r\nof the meaning of the shared lived experience of caring between nurse\r\nand nursed enhancing personhood can be created.\r\n\r\nYet, for the purposes of nursing, phenomenology also has its limits.\r\nFor example, when phenomena which have been abstracted from a nursing\r\nsituation are selected for study (that is, when phenomena are taken out\r\nof context), results of the inquiry cannot generate knowledge of nursing\r\nproper. For example, the understanding that comes in developing a\r\ndescription of the essential structure of what it is like for a nurse\r\nto be called to nurse informs us about nurses, but not about nursing\r\ndirectly. Similarly, an exquisite phenomenological description of what\r\nit is like for a person to live grieving is helpful in understanding the\r\nperson. However, it should not be mistaken for knowledge of nursing, but\r\nknowledge which illuminates the study of nursing when taken back to\r\nthe full context of the nursing situation. Further, the various\r\nphenomenologies in the literature come from frames of reference that are\r\nnot nursing (e.g., existential psychology or educational psychology),\r\nand thus impose a \"silent\" borrowed framework when used to study\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nIs this drawing too fine a line? And is it really important to press\r\nthe issue of nursing knowledge versus knowledge of and for nurses?\r\nThe answers to these questions are probably found in one's concept\r\nof nursing as a field of knowledge (discipline) and a human service\r\n(profession). It seems that nursing and nurses have suffered\r\nsignificantly over the years with this dilemma. Is it possible to have\r\na sense of self as nurse without a concomitant sense of nursing as\r\na discipline which is more than tacit and to which one is committed?\r\nStudents of nursing and practitioners alike have abundant opportunities\r\nto acquire a sense of self as nurse. Yet why is it that many programs of\r\nnursing education (at all levels) do not convey a sense of nursing as\r\na discipline? The answer may lie in those conducting the programs, who\r\nhave experienced training for practice and education in disciplines\r\nother than nursing and without explicit education in the discipline of\r\nnursing.\r\n\r\nFrom the perspective of Nursing as Caring, with its grounding in person\r\nas caring and nursing as discipline, the distinctions implied in this\r\nquestion of \"does it really matter\" are of central importance. Nurses\r\nin practice, education, and administration continue to address nursing\r\nprimarily in terms of \"what nurses do,\" (e.g., nursing \"interventions\")\r\nand most nursing research seems to derive from that perspective as\r\nwell. Without a clearly articulated understanding of the focus of the\r\ndiscipline, it has been extremely difficult to organize and structure\r\nnursing knowledge in ways that facilitate the development of the\r\ndiscipline. In this book, we have offered a theory, Nursing as Caring,\r\nas one expression of that focus, languaged in terms that communicate the\r\nessence of nursing.\r\n\r\nNursing knowledge is knowledge of nurturing persons living caring and\r\ngrowing in caring within shared lived experiences in which the caring\r\nbetween nurse and nursed enhances personhood. Furthering nursing\r\nknowledge requires methods that can illuminate the central phenomenon of\r\nthe discipline. The development of such a methodology is, as we see it,\r\nthe next major effort to be undertaken in the development of the theory.\r\nIn this regard, we envision a fully adequate methodology that would\r\ninclude a phenomenological aspect which goes beyond description to a\r\nhermeneutical process, within an action research orientation. That is,\r\nwhat seems to be needed is a methodology that would permit the study of\r\nnursing meaning as it is being co-created in the lived experience of\r\nthe nursing situation. Supplemental methods could continue to include\r\ntraditional phenomenological and hermeneutic work with texts describing\r\nparticular nursing situations. Nurses who are interested in developing\r\nknowledge of techniques or modes of expressing caring would continue to\r\nuse traditional methods of formal and human science for these kinds of\r\nnursing-related questions.\r\n\r\nThe development of methods of nursing inquiry appropriate to the study\r\nof the theory, Nursing as Caring, is in a formative stage. We understand\r\nto a considerable extent the limitations of existing modes of inquiry,\r\nand have a growing sense of what will be required of a new methodology.\r\nNursing scholars are working to develop methods to illuminate the\r\nfullness of nursing. Examples of that work which has encouraged our\r\nefforts include that by Parker (1993), Swanson-Kauffman (1986), Parse\r\n(1990), and Ray (Wallace, 1992). The work of these scholars demonstrates\r\nthat the development of nursing ways of inquiry is important and that\r\na search has begun. As we have come to understand the concept of human\r\nscience, our understanding of nursing has been enriched. Like most\r\nof our contemporaries in nursing, we were trained in the\r\noften-unarticulated assumptions of natural science. And we have traveled\r\nthe road familiar to many nursing scholars, the road of expertise in\r\nobjectification and quantification. Along that road, we began to notice\r\nthe trivialization of cherished nursing ideas like presence, touch,\r\nrelationship, knowing, and caring. Resisting the temptation to abandon\r\nthe journey, we each persevered in a commitment to nursing as something\r\nwhich mattered, something involving intimate, personal, caring\r\nrelationships. Discovering, inventing, and creating a new methodology\r\nis an important dream and we are committed to continuing this aspect of\r\ntheory development.\r\n\r\nNursing as Caring is a transformational model for all arenas. Nursing\r\npractice, nursing service organization, nursing education, and nursing\r\ninquiry require a full understanding of nursing as nurturing persons\r\nliving caring and growing in caring, and these underlying assumptions:\r\n\r\n  * Persons are caring by virtue of their humanness.\r\n  * Persons are caring, moment to moment.\r\n  * Persons are whole or complete in the moment.\r\n  * Personhood is a process of living grounded in caring.\r\n  * Personhood is enhanced through participating in nurturing relationships with caring others.\r\n  * Nursing is both a discipline and profession.\r\n\r\nWith these transformations, the fullness of nursing will be realized and\r\nwe will grow in our understanding of self and other as caring persons\r\nconnected in oneness.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Boeckh, P.

The theory\r\nwas explicated in the original release of Nursing as Caring: A Model for\r\nTransforming Practice in 1993 (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1993). As work has\r\nprogressed to develop the theory for use in nursing practice, research\r\nand education, the underlying assumptions introduced in Chapter 1 have\r\nbeen affirmed as central to the integrity of the theory. This epilogue\r\nhighlights ongoing development of the theory by its authors and by other\r\nnurses. Developmental efforts include clarification of the concept of\r\npersonhood, expansion of the understanding of enhancing per-sonhood as\r\nthe general \"outcome\" of nursing, research innovations, and use of\r\nthe theory in middle range theory work and in the critical analysis of\r\ncaring.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLARIFICATION OF THE CONCEPT OF PERSONHOOD\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 1, personhood was described as a process of living grounded\r\nin caring. In an effort to clarify the meaning of \"a process\" in\r\nthe context of the theory of Nursing as Caring, we explained\r\nthat personhood, understood as living grounded in caring, is\r\nprocessual--ongoing, experienced moment to moment, evolutionary,\r\ntransformative--rather than a generalized sequence of steps or\r\noperations. In subsequent publications, personhood was described as\r\n\"living grounded in caring,\" eliminating the problematic use of the term\r\n\"process\" entirely (Schoenhofer & Boykin, 1998a; Boykin & Schoenhofer,\r\n2000).\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEARCH DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPTS OF PERSON AS CARING AND PERSONHOOD\r\n\r\nNursing as Caring guides nurses to enter into the world of the other\r\nand allows them to come to know the nursed as living caring uniquely in\r\nsituation. In consulting with nurses using Nursing as Caring as their\r\nframework for practice, we found that nurses could easily recognize\r\nexpressions of caring when caring was lived in ways familiar to their\r\nown lifeworlds. However, in nursing situations where personal ways of\r\ncaring were outside the experience of the nurse, there seemed to be\r\ndifficulties in knowing and thus affirming the nursed as person uniquely\r\nliving caring in the moment. Without this situated knowing, we saw\r\nthat nurses tended to lose the focus of recognizing the other as living\r\ncaring uniquely in the moment, and instead, to concentrate on ways in\r\nwhich persons \"were not living caring\" and \"should grow in caring.\" This\r\ntendency to return to a normative practice framework in difficult times\r\nis easily understood as nurses struggle to transcend a familiar paradigm\r\ncharacterized by terms such as \"nursing process,\" \"nursing diagnosis,\"\r\n\"nursing intervention\" and to evolve toward what has been called a\r\nsimultaneity paradigm (Parse, 1987).\r\n\r\nBecause knowing the other as caring is the basic act of nursing,\r\nit became clear to us that knowledge expansion would be helpful in\r\nenhancing nurses' ability to recognize uniquely personal ways their\r\npatients live the value of caring. Schoenhofer conducted a series\r\nof studies over several years to develop knowledge of personal lived\r\nmeaning of everyday caring. In one unpublished study, adolescents shared\r\nstories of personal caring. Their stories were found to center around\r\nthe theme of \"helping out.\" Adolescents described everyday caring in\r\nterms such as \"cheering up someone you love,\" \"helping another get what\r\nthey need,\" \"work as caring,\" \"caring by physical presence.\" The stories\r\nillustrated situations where caring was expressed as \"helping out when\r\nyou don't really want to, but doing it anyway,\" \"helping without being\r\nasked,\" \"filling in where caring is missing.\" One teenage boy told of\r\ncaring for a former girlfriend who was angry about their breakup; he\r\nmade deliberate efforts to remain active as a friend, as a way to\r\nhelp the girl deal with the loss of their romantic relationship. He\r\ncharacterized his caring as \"keeping on showing care even though it\r\ndoesn't seem to change things.\"\r\n\r\nIn another similar study, 4th grade students told stories of caring in\r\nwhich they acted as advocates for other children and offered help to\r\nothers, both adults and children, who were perceived as less fortunate\r\nand in need of care (Schoenhofer, Bingham & Hutchins, 1998). Adults,\r\ntoo, have unique and personal ways of living their everyday caring.\r\nOne father related an example of caring for his young daughter by\r\nrestricting her activities because of poor school performance, and\r\nthen engaging in a dialogue with her that resulted in a compromise. The\r\nfather saw willingness to discipline as an act of caring and felt that\r\nhis willingness to listen to the child's perspective was also part of\r\nhis caring (Schoenhofer, Bingham & Hutchins, 1998). Several adults whose\r\nparents had become disabled told stories of caring for parents in ways\r\nthat preserved cherished role relationships. These adults understood\r\nthat their caring required extra effort to avoid infantalization of the\r\nparent but felt that without that extra effort, attention would be given\r\nto certain needs but adequate caring would not be given.\r\n\r\nResearch into everyday caring was conducted in a group discussion\r\nformat, with persons invited to relate a story that illustrated how they\r\nlived their caring in everyday situations. The ease with which these\r\nresearch participants understood what was being asked of them, their\r\nwillingness to respond and the clarity of the exemplars they shared have\r\nthe potential to inform nursing practice. When nurse colleagues learned\r\nof this research effort, they often expressed doubt that people could\r\nand would describe their everyday caring ways. Based on the experience\r\nof the researchers and research participants in this series of studies,\r\nhowever, it became clear that persons do understand their unique ways of\r\ncaring, and do recognize the importance of sharing that understanding.\r\n\r\nNurses committed to practice guided by the tenets of Nursing as Caring\r\ncan and should incorporate direct invitation as part of their coming to\r\nknow other as caring person, A number of important benefits are possible\r\nwith a direct approach to knowing the other as caring. One benefit is\r\nthat as the nurse raises the issue of caring, patients are helped\r\nto understand that caring is of immediate importance to nurses,\r\nthus clarifying the service and value of nursing among the health\r\ndisciplines. A second benefit is that as nurses address caring directly\r\nwith their patients, nurses themselves gain affirmation of nursing as\r\na caring service and of themselves as persons committed to caring.\r\nHowever, the most immediate benefit of a direct approach to caring is\r\nthe opening of a line of communication that clearly establishes the\r\n\"caring between,\" that space, that relationship within which and\r\nthrough which all that is important in nursing occurs. The patient is\r\ngiven the opportunity to recognize self as caring person and to join\r\nin mutual affirmation and celebration with the nurse. Nurses who are\r\nreluctant to engage patients in dialogues about caring ways may think\r\nthe topic is \"too intimate.\" It is true that caring is intimate and\r\npersonal, but caring is also very visible, just as many of the topics\r\nintroduced in the nursing situation are personal and intimate and have\r\nvisible referents. As nurses have the courage to raise the topic of\r\ncaring, the central importance of caring in human living can become not\r\nonly recognized but openly and publicly valued.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEARCH DEVELOPMENT OF NURSING OUTCOMES-VALUES EXPERIENCED IN THE NURSING SITUATION\r\n\r\nAnother research thread has focused on the development of an approach to\r\nidentifying and languaging outcomes of nursing guided by the theory of\r\nNursing as Caring (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1997; Schoenhofer & Boykin,\r\n1998a, 1998b). Within the context of the theory, the idea of outcomes\r\nhas been reconceptualized as \"values experienced in the nursing\r\nsituation.\" Several case studies illuminated a dialogical form of praxis\r\ninvolving nurse, patient and researcher that revealed values experienced\r\nby patients and their nurses. Values experienced by families, health\r\ncare administrators and systems were also uncovered as the caring\r\ncreated in the nursing situation was found to resonate beyond the\r\nimmediate nurse-patient relationship. This line of research has\r\ndemonstrated that while traditional economic valuation can be\r\ncalculated, the value of caring in nursing can and must be more clearly\r\nexplicated in human terms. For example, one case study of home health\r\nnursing found that the economic value of six nursing visits produced a\r\nhealth care cost savings of $5,709, primarily by obviating the necessity\r\nof trips to the emergency department of the local hospital. Through\r\nthis unique research approach, the human value of the six visits was\r\nidentified and languaged in terms that clearly demonstrate the direct,\r\nunmediated worth of nursing care--to the one nursed, the family, the\r\nnurse and the larger circle of health care systems. The patient and\r\nfamily gained the important value of confidence through the caring\r\nof the home health nurse; with the nurse's commitment to caring,\r\nthey gained faith in themselves, their ability to deal with new\r\nhealth-related situations as they arose, faith that they wouldn't be\r\nleft alone, faith that they were known as persons valuable in their\r\nown right and worthy of care. This is the value of nursing, the reason\r\nnursing exists as a distinguishable social and human service. Nurses\r\ncan learn to assert the human value of nursing, and in fact, nurses must\r\naccept the responsibility for bringing the human value of care to the\r\nforefront. Re-establishing the primary position of care in the health\r\ncare arena depends on nurses speaking out in clearly human terms about\r\nthe meaning and value of care, using the language of caring knowledgably\r\nand without apology.\r\n\r\nIn May, 2000, Boykin launched a funded study to examine the potential\r\nof the theory of Nursing as Caring to enhance the achievement of quality\r\noutcomes in acute care settings. This two-year demonstration project and\r\nevaluation study involves specifying quality indicators and targeting\r\nbenchmarks prior to introducing the theory as the nursing practice\r\nframework in the acute care division of a community hospital. On-site\r\nguidance and consultation in the use of the theory will be available\r\nduring the course of the project. Post-program evaluation will focus\r\non quality indicators and benchmarks relating to patient and staff\r\nsatisfaction, family and community support, and cost-benefit care\r\nratios.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE THEORY OF NURSING AS CARING AS A CONCEPTUAL FRAME FOR MIDDLE-RANGE THEORIES\r\n\r\nA theory that describes or explains a limited range of situations.\r\nLocsin (1995) developed a model of the harmonious relation between\r\ntechnology and caring in nursing. Further development of the model\r\nled to a theory of technological competence as caring in critical care\r\nnursing (Locsin, 1998). The mediating factors between application of\r\ntechnology and caring in nursing are posited as intentionality and\r\nauthentic presence. The underlying theoretical framework draws on the\r\ntheory of Nursing as Caring, and particularly the focus of nursing as\r\nknowing and thus nurturing the other as caring person. The intention to\r\nknow the other as caring person is actualized through direct knowing\r\nas well as through the medium of technologically produced data. The\r\nintention to care, to nurture the other as caring, is expressed in\r\ninterpersonal ways as well as in technological competence.\r\n\r\nDunphy (1998) drew on aspects of the theory of Nursing as Caring,\r\nparticularly the idea of knowing the other as caring person, in the\r\ndevelopment of a model for advanced practice nursing, \"the circle of\r\ncaring.\" Dunphy was concerned with clarifying the disciplinary identify\r\nof advanced practice nursing as nursing. In an effort to transcend\r\nperspectives of advanced practice nursing based on the traditional\r\nreductionist medical science and nursing process models, processes of\r\ncare are superimposed on a traditional medical model (Dunphy, 1998). The\r\ncircle of care \"incorporates individual strengths of both nursing and\r\nmedicine but reformulates them in a new model of care... rooted in the\r\nlived experience of the patient\" (p. 11). Caring quality indicators\r\nsuffuse the entire model, and include courage, authentic presence,\r\nadvocacy, knowing, commitment and patience. Elements formerly termed\r\ndiagnosis and treatment are termed caring processes in the new model,\r\nin an attempt to ground advanced practice in nursing values. The core\r\ncomponent of the model, caring processes, focuses on ways of knowing the\r\nperson as caring and of truly being with the person in advanced practice\r\nnursing situations. It is this core that provides the crucial link of\r\ncaring as the central focus of both traditional nursing and advanced\r\npractice nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE THEORY OF NURSING AS CARING\r\n\r\nThere is evidence that the theory of Nursing as Caring has entered the\r\nmainstream of nursing thought. Nursing as Caring is included in several\r\ncollected and/or edited works on nursing theories (George, 1995; Parker,\r\n1993; Parker, 2000). In George's (1995) compendium of general nursing\r\ntheories, Nursing as Caring is described and the structures of nursing\r\nprocess and the metaparadigm concepts of Fawcett are used as a\r\nframework for analysis and evaluation. Parker's books, Patterns of\r\nNursing Theories in Practice (1993) and Nursing Theories and Nursing\r\nPractice (2000) are collections of original chapters authored by the\r\nvarious nurse theorists and by nurses using the particular theory in\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nNursing as Caring is represented in both these books by original\r\nchapters authored by the theory's originators (Schoenhofer & Boykin,\r\n1993; Boykin & Schoenhofer, 2000) as well as by chapters written by\r\nnurses describing their practice which is guided by the theory (Kearney\r\n&Yeager, 1993; Linden, 2000).\r\n\r\nNursing as Caring was one of four caring theories included in a\r\ncomparative analysis reported by McCance, McKenna and Boore (1999). That\r\nanalysis was based on a number of factors, including origin, scope\r\nand key concepts of the theory, definition of caring, description of\r\nnursing, the goal or outcome of nursing from the perspective of the\r\ntheory, and simplicity of the internal structure. Findings of the\r\nanalysis were developed in terms of utility of the theory in practice.\r\nSmith (1999) analyzed concepts from the literature on caring in nursing\r\nin an effort to uncover points of congruence between that literature and\r\nthe theoretical perspective of the Science of Unitary Human Beings.\r\nThe theory of Nursing as Caring figured prominently in Smith's concept\r\nclarification, contributing to four of the five synthesized constitutive\r\nmeanings of caring: manifesting intentions, appreciating pattern,\r\nattuning to dynamic flow and inviting creative emergence (Smith, 1999).\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEARCH METHOD DEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\nIn Chapter 6, Theory Development and Research, we envisioned an\r\napproach that \"would include a phenomenological aspect which goes beyond\r\ndescription to an hermeneutical process, within an action research\r\norientation\" (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1993, p. 97). Two research\r\napproaches have been developed within the context of studying Nursing as\r\nCaring, one focusing on discovering the lived meaning of everyday caring\r\nand the second directed toward understanding the value experienced in\r\nnursing situations.\r\n\r\nThere is relatively little literature that deliberately sets out to\r\ndescribe the multitude of ways of human caring. However, most if not\r\nall human text does reflect uniquely personal ways of caring, and\r\ncan profitably be studied for this purpose. In an effort to provide a\r\nknowledge base of the variety of human caring ways, one of the authors\r\n(Schoenhofer) innovated a group phenomenology approach in which research\r\nparticipants not only generated data in group settings, but also led the\r\nsynthesis of meaning (Schoenhofer, Bingham, & Hutchins, 1997). The\r\ngroup approach to data generation was chosen for several reasons--one\r\nwas efficiency, but the primary reason was a belief in the synergistic\r\npotential of the group process experience. The group approach to data\r\nsynthesis was added to the design based on the assumption that persons\r\nliving the phenomenon being studied and generating the data may be most\r\nwell qualified to intuit meaning across examples. The series of studies\r\nof everyday caring may best be understood as general foundational human\r\nscience, rather than as nursing science per se. Results of the studies\r\nproduced knowledge that has potential to enlighten nursing practice,\r\nrather than producing direct knowledge of nursing practice.\r\n\r\nWhile initiated for research purposes, the group phenomenology\r\napproach became a form of nursing praxis. Early in the project,\r\ngroups spontaneously shared a sense of pleasure and gratitude for the\r\nexperience of celebrating themselves and each other as caring persons.\r\nThis opportunity for reflection was then added as closure for the\r\nsubsequent groups as it was recognized by the primary researchers that\r\nthe tenets of Nursing as Caring were being lived: persons were known,\r\nacknowledged, affirmed and celebrated as caring; per-sonhood was\r\nenhanced as group members recapitulated, clarified and reaffirmed\r\nthe meaning and value of caring in their lives; caring between nurse\r\n(researchers) and nursed in the nursing (research) situation was created\r\nand persons were nurtured in their uniquely personal ways of caring.\r\n\r\nA second research approach was designed to study values experienced in\r\nnursing situations (Schoenhofer & Boykin, 1998a; 1998b). The design of\r\nthis approach was based on several considerations: 1) the tenet that all\r\nthat can be known of nursing is known through the nursing situation, the\r\nshared lived experience of caring between nurse and nursed; and, 2)\r\nthe blurred lines between research and practice, between roles of\r\nresearcher, practitioner and even patient. A mode of inquiry into\r\noutcomes of caring in nursing, from the perspective of Nursing as\r\nCaring, must necessarily be centered within the nursing situation. In\r\nearlier phases of this research, only the nurse participated in the\r\nresearch dialogue (Boykin & Schoenhofer, 1997). While this approach was\r\nfruitful, two important qualities were missing: 1) the synergism that\r\nbrought a wealth of rich data when both nurse and nursed were present;\r\nand, 2) the intersubjective confirmation provided by having both the\r\nnurse and the nursed as research participants. Once again, the mutuality\r\nof the dialogue about the value of caring experienced went beyond\r\nsimple data production for research purposes. The dialogue itself was an\r\nextension of the nursing relationship and the caring between nurse and\r\nnursed, with the research nurse now included in the unfolding nursing\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Button]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThis epilogue has been written to bring the reader up to date on the\r\ndevelopment of the theory of Nursing as Caring. Developmental efforts\r\nprojected in Chapter 6 are still needed, and efforts in progress hold\r\npromise for further development. As the cadre of nurses interested in\r\nworking within the theory grows, development will accelerate, in both\r\nprojected and novel directions.\r\n\r\nAnne Boykin, PhD, RN Professor and Dean College of Nursing Florida\r\nAtlantic University\r\n\r\nBoca Raton, Florida\r\n\r\nOctober, 2000\r\n\r\nSavina O.

Schoenhofer\r\n\r\nCaring is one of the first words that comes to mind when talking about\r\nthe practice of nursing. Caring is an essential value in the personal\r\nand professional lives of nurses. However, the formal recognition of\r\ncaring in nursing as an area of study is relatively new. Nursing As\r\nCaring sets forth a different order of nursing theory.\r\n\r\nThis new nursing theory is personal, not abstract. The focus of the\r\nNursing As Caring theory is not toward an end product such as health or\r\nwellness; it is about a unique way of nurses living caring in the world.\r\nThis theory provides a view that can be lived in all nursing situations\r\nand can be practiced alone or in combination with other theories. This\r\nis perhaps the most basic, bedrock, and therefore radical, of nursing\r\ntheories and is essential to all that is truly nursing.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCE",
