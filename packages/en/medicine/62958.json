Nothing is farther\r\nfrom my intention than to disparage their several merits, or to question\r\ntheir claims to professional utility; but in truth and justice it must\r\nbe confessed that, as far as these works relate to the art of composing\r\nscientific prescriptions, their authors have not escaped the too common\r\nerror of supposing that the reader is already grounded in the first\r\nprinciples of the science; or, to borrow the figurative illustration of\r\na popular writer, _that while they are in the ship of science, they\r\nforget the disciple cannot arrive without a boat_. I am not acquainted\r\nwith any book that is calculated to furnish such assistance, or which\r\nprofesses to teach the GRAMMAR, and ground-work of this important branch\r\nof medical knowledge. Numerous are the works which present us with the\r\ndetail, but no one with the philosophy of the subject. We have copious\r\ncatalogues of formal recipes, and many of unexceptionable propriety, but\r\nthe compilers do not venture to discuss the principles upon which they\r\nwere constructed, nor do they explain the part which each ingredient is\r\nsupposed to perform in the general scheme of the formula; they cannot\r\ntherefore lead to any useful generalization, and the young practitioner,\r\nwithout a beacon that can direct his course in safety, is abandoned to\r\nthe alternative of two great evils—a feeble and servile routine, on one\r\nhand, or a wild and lawless empiricism, on the other. The present volume\r\nis an attempt to supply this deficiency: and while I am anxious to\r\n‘catch the ideas which lead from ignorance to knowledge,’ it is not\r\nwithout hope that I may also be able to suggest the means by which our\r\nalready acquired knowledge may be more widely and usefully extended;\r\nand, by offering a collective and arranged view of the objects and\r\nresources of medicinal combination, to establish its practice upon the\r\nbasis of science, and thereby to render its future career of improvement\r\nprogressive with that of the other branches of medicine; or, to follow\r\nup the figurative illustration already introduced, _to furnish a boat,\r\nwhich may not only convey the disciple to the ship, but which may also\r\nassist in piloting the ship herself from her shallow and treacherous\r\nmoorings_. That the design however of the present work may not be\r\nmistaken, it is essential to remark that it is elementary only in\r\nreference to the art of prescribing, for it is presumed that the student\r\nis already acquainted with the common manipulations of pharmacy, and\r\nwith the first principles of chemistry. When any allusions are made to\r\nthe processes of the Pharmacopœia, they are to be understood as being\r\nonly supplementary, or as explanatory of their nature, in reference to\r\nthe application or medicinal powers of the substance in question. The\r\nterm PHARMACOLOGIA, as applied to the present work, may therefore be\r\nconsidered as contradistinctive to that of PHARMACOPŒIA; for while the\r\nlatter denotes the processes for _preparing_, the former comprehends the\r\nscientific methods of _administering_ medicinal bodies, and explains the\r\nobjects and theory of their operation. The articles of the Materia\r\nMedica have been arranged in alphabetical order, not only as being that\r\nbest calculated for reference, but one which, in an elementary work at\r\nleast, is less likely to mislead, than any arrangement founded on their\r\nmedicinal powers; for in consequence of the difficulty of discriminating\r\nin every case between the primary and secondary effects of a medicine,\r\nsubstances very dissimilar in their nature, have been enlisted into the\r\nsame artificial group, and when several of such bodies have, from a\r\nreliance upon their unity of action, been associated together in a\r\nmedicinal mixture, it has often happened that, like the armed men of\r\nCadmus, they have opposed and destroyed each other. The object and\r\napplication of the black marginal letters, to which the name of _Key\r\nLetters_ has been given, are fully explained in the First Part of the\r\nwork, and it is hoped, that the scheme possesses a more substantial\r\nclaim to notice than that of mere novelty: it will be perceived that in\r\nthe enumeration of the officinal formulæ these letters are also\r\noccasionally introduced, to express the manner in which the particular\r\nsubstance, under the head of which it stands, operates in the\r\ncombination. If any apology be necessary for the introduction of the\r\nmedicinal formulæ, it may be offered in the words of Quintillian, who\r\nvery justly observes, “_In omnibus fere minus valent præcepta quam\r\nexempla_;” or in the language of Seneca; “_Longum est iter per præcepta,\r\nbreve et efficax per exempla_.” Under the history of each article, I\r\nhave endeavoured to concentrate all that is required to be known for its\r\nefficacious administration, such as, 1. _Its sensible qualities._ 2.\r\n_Its chemical composition_, or the constituents in which its medicinal\r\nactivity resides. 3. _Its relative solubility in different menstrua, and\r\nthe proportions in which it should be mixed, or combined with different\r\nbodies, in order to produce suspension, or saturation._ 4. _The\r\nIncompatible Substances_; that is to say, those substances which are\r\ncapable of destroying its properties, or of rendering its flavour or\r\naspect unpleasant or disgusting. 5. _The most eligible forms in which it\r\ncan be exhibited._ 6. _Its specific doses._ 7. _Its Medicinal Uses, and\r\nEffects._ 8. _Its Preparations, Officinal_ as well as _Extemporaneous_.\r\n9. _Its Adulterations._ That such information is indispensible for the\r\nelegant and successful exhibition of a remedy, must be sufficiently\r\napparent; the injurious changes and modifications which substances\r\nundergo when they are improperly combined by the ignorant practitioner,\r\nare not as some have supposed imaginary, the mere _deliramenta\r\ndoctrinæ_, or the whimsical suggestions of theoretical refinement, but\r\nthey are really such as to render their powers unavailing, or to impart\r\na dangerous violence to their operation. “_Unda dabit flammas et dabit\r\nignis aquas._”\r\n\r\nIn the history of the different medicinal preparations, the pharmacopœia\r\nof the London College is the standard to which I have always referred,\r\nalthough it will be perceived that I have frequently availed myself of\r\nthe resources with which the pharmacopœias of Edinburgh and Dublin\r\nabound. To a knowledge of the numerous adulterations to which each\r\narticle is so shamefully exposed, too much importance can be scarcely\r\nattached; and under this palpable source of medicinal fallacy and\r\nfailure, may be fairly included those secret and illegitimate deviations\r\nfrom the acknowledged modes of preparation, as laid down in the\r\npharmacopœia, whether practised as expedients to obtain a lucrative\r\nnotoriety, or from a conceit of their being improvements upon the\r\nordinary processes; for instance, we have lately heard of a wholesale\r\nchemist who professes to supply a syrup of roses of very superior\r\nbeauty, and who, for this purpose, substitutes the petals of the _red_\r\n(rosa gallica) for those of the _damask_ rose (rosa centifolia); we need\r\nnot be told, that a preparation of a more exquisite colour may be thus\r\nafforded, but allow me to ask if this _underhanded_ substitution be not\r\na manifest act of injustice to the medical practitioner, who, instead of\r\na laxative syrup, receives one which is marked by the opposite character\r\nof astringency. These observations will not apply, of course, to those\r\narticles which are _avowedly_ prepared by a new process; for in that\r\ncase the practitioner is enabled to make his election, and either to\r\nadopt or refuse them at his discretion. Thus has Mr. Barry applied his\r\ningenious patent apparatus for boiling _in vacuo_, to the purpose of\r\nmaking Extracts; we might almost say _a priori_, that the results must\r\nbe more active than those obtained in the ordinary way, but they must\r\npass the ordeal of experience before they can be admitted into practice.\r\nAs a brief notice of the most notorious _Quack Medicines_ may be\r\nacceptable, the formulæ for their preparation have been appended in\r\nnotes, each being placed at the foot of the particular article which\r\nconstitutes its prominent ingredient; indeed it is essential that the\r\npractitioner should be acquainted with their composition, for although\r\nhe would refuse to superintend the operation of a boasted _panacea_, it\r\nis but too probable that he may be called upon to counteract its baleful\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nThe _Historical Introduction_, comprehending the substance of the\r\nlectures delivered before the Royal College of Physicians of London,\r\nfrom the recently established chair of Materia Medica, has been prefixed\r\nto the work, at the desire of several of the auditors; and I confess my\r\nreadiness to comply with this request, as it enabled me at once to\r\nobviate any misconception or unjust representation of those remarks\r\nwhich I felt it my bounden duty to offer to the College.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the work itself is divided into two separate\r\nand very distinct parts, the _First_ comprehending the principles of the\r\nart of combination,—the _Second_, the medicinal history, and chemical\r\nhabitudes of the bodies which are the subjects of such combination.\r\nThese comprise every legitimate source of instruction, and to the young\r\nand industrious student, they are at once the LOOM and the RAW MATERIAL.\r\nLet him therefore abandon those flimsy and ill-adapted textures, that\r\nare kept ready fabricated for the service of ignorance and indolence,\r\nand by actuating the machinery himself, weave the materials with which\r\nhe is here presented into the forms and objects that may best fulfil his\r\nintentions, and meet the various exigencies of each particular occasion.\r\n\r\n                                                                J.

Such an introduction is naturally suggested by the\r\nfirst glance at the extensive and motly assemblage of substances with\r\nwhich our cabinets[1] are overwhelmed. It is impossible to cast our eyes\r\nover such multiplied groups, without being forcibly struck with the\r\npalpable absurdity of some—the total want of activity in many—and the\r\nuncertain and precarious reputation of all—or, without feeling an eager\r\ncuriosity to enquire, from the combination of what causes it can have\r\nhappened, that substances, at one period in the highest esteem, and of\r\ngenerally acknowledged utility, have fallen into total neglect and\r\ndisrepute;—why others, of humble pretensions and little significance,\r\nhave maintained their ground for so many centuries; and on what account,\r\nmaterials of no energy whatever, have received the indisputable sanction\r\nand unqualified support of the best and wisest practitioners of the age.\r\nThat such fluctuations in opinion and versatility in practice should\r\nhave produced, even in the most candid and learned observers, an\r\nunfavourable impression with regard to the general efficacy of\r\nmedicines, can hardly excite our astonishment, much less our\r\nindignation; nor can we be surprised to find, that another portion of\r\nmankind has at once arraigned Physic as a fallacious art, or derided it\r\nas a composition of error and fraud.[2] They ask—and it must be\r\nconfessed that they ask with reason—what pledge can be afforded them,\r\nthat the boasted remedies of the present day will not, like their\r\npredecessors, fall into disrepute, and in their turn serve only as\r\nhumiliating memorials of the credulity and infatuation of the physicians\r\nwho commended and prescribed them? There is surely no question connected\r\nwith our subject which can be more interesting and important, no one\r\nwhich requires a more cool and dispassionate inquiry, and certainly not\r\nany which can be more appropriate for a lecture, introductory to the\r\nhistory of Materia Medica. I shall therefore proceed to examine with\r\nsome attention the revolutions which have thus taken place in the\r\nopinions and belief of mankind, with regard to the efficacy and powers\r\nof different medicinal agents; such an inquiry, by referring them to\r\ncauses capable of a philosophical investigation, is calculated to remove\r\nmany of the unjust prejudices which have been excited, to quiet the\r\ndoubts and alarms which have been so industriously propagated, and, at\r\nthe same time, to obviate the recurrence of several sources of error and\r\ndisappointment.\r\n\r\nThis moral view of events, without any regard to chronological minutiæ,\r\nmay be denominated the PHILOSOPHY OF HISTORY, and should be carefully\r\ndistinguished from that technical and barren erudition, which consists\r\nin a mere knowledge of _names_ and _dates_, and which is perused by the\r\nmedical student with as much apathy, and as little profit, as the monk\r\ncounts his bead-roll. It has been very justly observed, that there is a\r\ncertain maturity of the human mind, acquired from generation to\r\ngeneration, in the _mass_, as there is in the different stages of life,\r\nin the _individual_ man; what is history, when thus philosophically\r\nstudied, but the faithful record of this progress? pointing out for our\r\ninstruction the various causes which have retarded or accelerated it in\r\ndifferent ages and countries.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the history of the Materia Medica to its earliest periods, we\r\nshall find that its progress towards its present advanced state, has\r\nbeen very slow and unequal, very unlike the steady and successive\r\nimprovement which has attended other branches of natural knowledge; we\r\nshall perceive even that its advancement has been continually arrested,\r\nand often entirely subverted, by the caprices, prejudices,\r\nsuperstitions, and knavery of mankind; unlike too the other branches of\r\nscience, it is incapable of successful generalization; in the progress\r\nof the history of remedies, when are we able to produce a discovery or\r\nimprovement, which has been the result of that happy combination of\r\nObservation, Analogy, and Experiment,[3] which has so eminently rewarded\r\nthe labours of modern science? Thus, OBSERVATION led Newton to discover\r\nthat the refractive power of transparent substances was, in general, in\r\nthe ratio of their density, but that, of substances of equal density,\r\nthose which possessed the refractive power in a higher degree were\r\ninflammable.[4] ANALOGY induced him to conclude that, on this account,\r\nwater must contain an inflammable principle, and EXPERIMENT enabled\r\nCavendish and Lavoisier to demonstrate the surprising truth of Newton’s\r\ninduction, in their immortal discovery of the chemical composition of\r\nthat fluid.\r\n\r\nThe history of Astronomy furnishes another illustration equally\r\nbeautiful and instructive,—The Astronomer _observed_ certain\r\noscillations in the motions of Saturn and Jupiter; by _Analogy_ he\r\nconjectured that this phenomenon was produced by the influence of a\r\nplanet still more remote: a supposition which was happily confirmed by a\r\ntelescopic _experiment_, in the discovery of Uranus, by Herschel.\r\n\r\nBut it is clear that such principles of research, and combination of\r\nmethods, can rarely be applied in the investigation of remedies, for\r\nevery problem which involves the phenomena of life is unavoidably\r\nembarrassed by circumstances, so complicated in their nature, and\r\nfluctuating in their operation, as to set at defiance every attempt to\r\nappreciate their influence; thus an observation or experiment upon the\r\neffects of a medicine is liable to a thousand fallacies, unless it be\r\ncarefully repeated under the various circumstances of health and\r\ndisease, in different climates, and on different constitutions. We all\r\nknow how very differently opium, or mercury, will act upon different\r\nindividuals, or even upon the same individual, at different times, or\r\nunder different circumstances; the effect of a stimulant upon the living\r\nbody is not in the ratio of the intensity of its impulse, but in\r\nproportion to the degree of excitement, or vital susceptibility of the\r\nindividual, to whom it is applied. This is illustrated in a clear and\r\nfamiliar manner, by the very different sensations of heat which the same\r\ntemperature will produce under different circumstances. In the road over\r\nthe Andes, at about half way between the foot and the summit, there is a\r\ncottage in which the ascending and descending travellers meet; the\r\nformer, who have just quitted the sultry vallies at the base, are so\r\nrelaxed, that the sudden diminution of temperature produces in them the\r\nfeeling of intense cold, whilst the latter, who have left the frozen\r\nsummits of the mountain, are overcome by the distressing sensation of\r\nextreme heat.\r\n\r\nBut we need not climb the Andes for an illustration; if we plunge one\r\nhand into a basin of hot, and the other into one of cold water, and then\r\nmix the contents of each vessel, and replace both hands in the mixture,\r\nwe shall experience the sensation of heat and cold, from one and the\r\nsame medium; the hand, that had been previously in the hot, will feel\r\ncold, whilst that which had been immersed in the cold water, will\r\nexperience a sensation of heat. Upon the same principle, ardent spirits\r\nwill produce very opposite effects upon different constitutions and\r\ntemperaments, and we are thus enabled to reconcile the conflicting\r\ntestimonies respecting the powers of opium in the cure of fever:\r\naliments, also, which under ordinary circumstances would occasion but\r\nlittle effect, may in certain conditions of the system, act as powerful\r\nstimulants; a fact which is well exemplified by the history of persons\r\nwho have been enclosed in coal mines for several days without food, from\r\nthe accidental falling in of the surrounding strata, when they have been\r\nas much intoxicated by a basin of broth, as a person, in common\r\ncircumstances, would have been by two or more bottles of wine.[5] Many\r\ninstances will suggest themselves to the practitioner in farther\r\nillustration of these views, and I shall have occasion to recur to the\r\nsubject at a future period.\r\n\r\nTo such causes we must attribute the barren labours of the ancient\r\nempirics, who saw without discerning, administered without\r\ndiscriminating, and concluded without reasoning; nor should we be\r\nsurprised at the very imperfect state of the materia medica, as far as\r\nit depends upon what is commonly called experience, complicated as this\r\nsubject is by its numberless relations with Physiology, Pathology, and\r\nChemistry. John Ray attempted to enumerate the virtues of plants from\r\n_experience_, and the system serves only to commemorate his failure.\r\nVogel likewise professed to assign to substances, those powers which had\r\nbeen learnt from accumulated experience; and he speaks of _roasted\r\ntoad_[6] as a specific for the pains of gout, and asserts that a person\r\nmay secure himself for the whole year from angina by eating a roasted\r\nswallow! Such must ever be the case, when medicines derive their origin\r\nfrom false experience, and their reputation from blind credulity.\r\n\r\nANALOGY has undoubtedly been a powerful instrument in the improvement,\r\nextension, and correction of the materia medica, but it has been chiefly\r\nconfined to modern times; for in the earlier ages, Chemistry had not so\r\nfar unfolded the composition of bodies, as to furnish any just idea of\r\ntheir relations to each other, nor had the science of Botany taught us\r\nthe value and importance of the natural affinities which exist in the\r\nvegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the fallacies to which such analogies are exposed, I\r\nshall hereafter speak at some length, and examine the pretensions of\r\nthose _ultra_ chemists of the present day who have upon every occasion\r\narraigned, at their self-constituted tribunal, the propriety of our\r\nmedicinal combinations, and the validity of our national pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the obstacles already enumerated, the progress of our\r\nknowledge respecting the virtues of medicines has met with others of a\r\nmoral character, which have deprived us in a great degree of another\r\nobvious method of research, and rendered our dependance upon testimony\r\nuncertain, and often entirely fallacious. The human understanding, as\r\nLord Bacon justly remarks, is not a mere faculty of apprehension, but is\r\naffected, more or less, by the will and the passions; what man wishes to\r\nbe true, that he too easily believes to be so, and I conceive that\r\nphysic has, of all the sciences, the least pretensions to proclaim\r\nitself independent of the empire of the passions.\r\n\r\nIn our researches to discover and fix the period when remedies were\r\nfirst applied for the alleviation of bodily suffering, we are soon lost\r\nin conjecture, or involved in fable; we are unable to reach the period\r\nin any country, when the inhabitants were destitute of medical\r\nresources, and we find among the most uncultivated tribes, that medicine\r\nis cherished as a blessing and practised as an art, as by the\r\ninhabitants of New Holland and New Zealand, by those of Lapland and\r\nGreenland, of North America, and of the interior of Africa. The personal\r\nfeelings of the sufferer, and the anxiety of those about him, must, in\r\nthe rudest state of society, have incited a spirit of industry and\r\nresearch to procure alleviation, the modification of heat and cold, of\r\nmoisture and dryness, and the regulation and change of diet and habit,\r\nmust have intuitively suggested themselves for the relief of pain;[7]\r\nand when these resources failed, charms, amulets, and incantations,[8]\r\nwere the natural expedients of the barbarian, ever more inclined to\r\nindulge the delusive hope of superstition, than to listen to the voice\r\nof sober reason. Traces of amulets may be discovered in very early\r\nhistory. The learned Dr. Warburton is evidently mistaken, when he\r\nassigns the origin of these magical instruments to the age of the\r\nPtolemies, which was not more than 300 years before Christ; this is at\r\nonce refuted by the testimony of Galen, who tells us that the Egyptian\r\nking, Nechepsus, who lived 630 years before the Christian era, had\r\nwritten, that a green jasper cut into the form of a dragon surrounded\r\nwith rays, if applied externally, would strengthen the stomach and\r\norgans of digestion.[9] We have moreover the authority of the Scriptures\r\nin support of this opinion; for what were the ear-rings which Jacob\r\nburied under the oak of Sechem, as related in Genesis, but amulets? and\r\nwe are informed by Josephus, in his Antiquities of the Jews,[10] that\r\nSolomon discovered a plant efficacious in the cure of Epilepsy, and that\r\nhe employed the aid of a charm or spell for the purpose of assisting its\r\nvirtues; the root of the herb was concealed in a ring, which was applied\r\nto the nostrils of the Demoniac, and Josephus remarks that he himself\r\nsaw a Jewish Priest practise the art of Solomon with complete success in\r\nthe presence of Vespasian, his sons, and the tribunes of the Roman\r\narmy.[11] Nor were such means confined to dark and barbarous ages;\r\nTheophrastus pronounced Pericles to be insane, because he discovered\r\nthat he wore an amulet about his neck; and, in the declining æra of the\r\nRoman empire, we find that this superstitious custom was so general,\r\nthat the Emperor Caracalla was induced to make a public edict ordaining\r\nthat no man should wear any superstitious amulets about his person.\r\n\r\nIn the progress of civilization, various fortuitous incidents,[12] and\r\neven errors in the choice and preparation of aliments, must have\r\ngradually unfolded the remedial powers of many natural substances; these\r\nwere recorded, and the authentic history of medicine may date its\r\ncommencement from the period when such records began.\r\n\r\nThe Chaldeans and Babylonians, we are told by Herodotus, carried their\r\nsick to the public roads and markets, that travellers might converse\r\nwith them, and communicate any remedies which had been successfully used\r\nin similar cases; this custom continued during many ages in Assyria; and\r\nStrabo states that it prevailed also amongst the ancient Lusitanians, or\r\nPortuguese: in this manner, however, the results of experience descended\r\nonly by oral tradition; it was in the temple of Esculapius in Greece\r\nthat medical information was first recorded; diseases and cures were\r\nthere registered on durable tablets of marble; the priests[13] and\r\npriestesses, who were the guardians of the temple, prepared the remedies\r\nand directed their application, and thus commenced the profession of\r\nPhysic. With respect to the actual nature of these remedies, it is\r\nuseless to inquire; the lapse of ages, loss of records, change of\r\nlanguage, and ambiguity of description, have rendered every learned\r\nresearch unsatisfactory; indeed we are in doubt with regard to many of\r\nthe medicines which even Hippocrates employed. It is however clearly\r\nshewn by the earliest records, that the ancients were in the possession\r\nof many powerful remedies; thus Melampus of Argos, the most ancient\r\nGreek physician with whom we are acquainted, is said to have cured one\r\nof the Argonauts of sterility, by administering the rust of iron in wine\r\nfor ten days; and the same physician used hellebore as a purge, on the\r\ndaughters of king Prætus, who were afflicted with melancholy.\r\nVenesection was also a remedy of very early origin; for Podalirius, on\r\nhis return from the Trojan war, cured the daughter of Damethus, who had\r\nfallen from a height, by bleeding her in both arms. Opium, or a\r\npreparation of the poppy, was certainly known in the earliest ages; it\r\nwas probably opium that Helen mixed with wine, and gave to the guests of\r\nMenelaus, under the expressive name of _nepenthe_,[14] to drive away\r\ntheir cares, and increase their hilarity; and this conjecture receives\r\nmuch support from the fact, that the _nepenthe_ of Homer was obtained\r\nfrom the Egyptian Thebes;[15] and if we may credit the opinion of Dr.\r\nDarwin, the Cumæan Sibyll never sat on the portending tripod without\r\nfirst swallowing a few drops of the juice of the _Cherry-laurel_.[16]\r\n\r\n   “At Phœbi nondum patiens, immanis in antro\r\n   Bacchatur Vates, magnum si pectore possit\r\n   Excussisse deum: tanto magis ille fatigat\r\n   Os rabidum, fera corda domans, fingitque premendo.”\r\n                                                   ÆNEID, l. vi. 78.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe that the Pagan priesthood were under the\r\ninfluence of some powerful narcotic during the display of their oracular\r\npowers, but the effects produced would seem to resemble rather those of\r\nOpium, or perhaps of Stramonium, than of the Prussic acid. Monardes\r\ntells us that the priests of the American Indians, whenever they were\r\nconsulted by the chief gentlemen, or _casiques_ as they are called, took\r\ncertain leaves of the Tobacco, and cast them into the fire, and then\r\nreceived the smoke, which they thus produced, in their mouths, in\r\nconsequence of which they fell down upon the ground; and that after\r\nhaving remained for some time in a stupor, they recovered, and delivered\r\nthe answers which they pretended to have received, during their supposed\r\nintercourse with the world of spirits.\r\n\r\nThe sedative powers of the _Lactuca Sativa_, or Lettuce,[17] were known\r\nalso in the earliest times; among the fables of antiquity, we read that\r\nafter the death of Adonis, Venus threw herself on a bed of lettuces, to\r\nlull her grief, and repress her desires. The sea onion or _Squill_, was\r\nadministered in cases of dropsy by the Egyptians, under the mystic title\r\nof the _Eye of Typhon_. The practices of incision and scarification were\r\nemployed in the camp of the Greeks before Troy, and the application of\r\nspirit to wounds was also understood, for we find the experienced Nestor\r\napplying a cataplasm, composed of cheese, onion, and meal, mixed up with\r\nthe wine of Pramnos, to the wounds of Machaon.[18]\r\n\r\nThe revolutions and vicissitudes which remedies have undergone, in\r\nmedical as well as popular opinion, from the ignorance of some ages,\r\nthe learning of others, the superstitions of the weak, and the designs\r\nof the crafty, afford ample subject for philosophical reflection; some\r\nof these revolutions I shall proceed to investigate, classing them\r\nunder the prominent causes which have produced them, viz.\r\nSuperstition—Credulity—Scepticism—False Theory—Devotion to Authority,\r\nand Established Routine—The assigning to Art that which was the effect\r\nof unassisted Nature—The assigning to peculiar substances Properties,\r\ndeduced from Experiments made on inferior Animals—Ambiguity of\r\nNomenclature—The progress of Botanical Science—The application, and\r\nmisapplication of Chemical Philosophy—The Influence of Climate and\r\nSeason on Diseases, as well as on the properties, and operations of\r\ntheir Remedies—The ignorant Preparation, or fraudulent Adulteration of\r\nMedicines—The unseasonable collection of those remedies which are of\r\nvegetable origin,—and, the obscurity which has attended the operation\r\nof compound medicines.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             SUPERSTITION.\r\n\r\nA belief in the interposition of supernatural powers in the direction of\r\nearthly events, has prevailed in every age and country, in an inverse\r\nratio with its state of civilization, or in the exact proportion to its\r\nwant of knowledge. “In the opinion of the ignorant multitude,” says Lord\r\nBacon, “witches and impostors have always held a competition with\r\nphysicians.” Galen also complains of this circumstance, and observes\r\nthat his patients were more obedient to the oracle in the temple of\r\nEsculapius, or to their own dreams, than they were to his prescriptions.\r\nThe same popular imbecility is evidently allegorized in the mythology of\r\nthe ancient poets, when they made both ESCULAPIUS and CIRCE the children\r\nof APOLLO; in truth, there is an unaccountable propensity in the human\r\nmind, unless subjected to a very long course of discipline, to indulge\r\nin the belief of what is improbable and supernatural; and this is\r\nperhaps more conspicuous with respect to physic than to any other affair\r\nof common life, both because the nature of diseases and the art of\r\ncuring them are more obscure, and because disease necessarily awakens\r\nfear, and fear and ignorance are the natural parents of superstition;\r\nevery disease therefore, the origin and cause of which did not\r\nimmediately strike the senses, has in all ages been attributed by the\r\nignorant to the wrath of heaven, to the resentment of some invisible\r\ndemon, or to some malignant aspect of the stars;[19] and hence the\r\nintroduction of a rabble of superstitious remedies, not a few of which\r\nwere rather intended as expiations at the shrines of these offended\r\nspirits, than as natural agents possessing medicinal powers. The\r\nintroduction of precious stones into the materia medica, arose from an\r\nArabian superstition of this kind; indeed De Boot, who has written\r\nextensively upon the subject, does not pretend to account for the\r\nvirtues of gems, upon any philosophical principle, but from their being\r\nthe residence of spirits, and he adds that such substances, from their\r\nbeauty, splendour and value, are well adapted as receptacles for _good_\r\nspirits![20]\r\n\r\nEvery substance whose origin is involved in mystery,[21] has at\r\ndifferent times been eagerly applied to the purposes of medicine: not\r\nlong since, one of those showers which are now known to consist of the\r\nexcrement of insects, fell in the north of Italy; the inhabitants\r\nregarded it as Manna, or some supernatural panacea, and they swallowed\r\nit with such avidity, that it was only by extreme address, that a small\r\nquantity was obtained for a chemical examination.\r\n\r\nA propensity to attribute every ordinary and natural effect to some\r\nextraordinary and unnatural cause, is one of the striking peculiarities\r\nof medical superstition; it seeks also explanations from the most\r\npreposterous agents, when obvious and natural ones are in readiness to\r\nsolve the problem. Soranus, for instance, who was cotemporary with\r\nGalen, and wrote the life of Hippocrates![22] tells us that honey proved\r\nan easy remedy for the aphthæ of children, but instead of at once\r\nreferring the fact to the medical qualities of the honey, he very\r\ngravely explains it, from its having been taken from bees that hived\r\nnear the tomb of Hippocrates! And even those salutary virtues which many\r\nherbs possess, were, in these times of superstitious delusion,\r\nattributed rather to the planet under whose ascendancy they were\r\ncollected or prepared, than to any natural and intrinsic properties in\r\nthe plants themselves; indeed such was the supposed importance of\r\nplanetary influence,[23] that it was usual to prefix to receipts a\r\nsymbol of the planet under whose reign the ingredients were to be\r\ncollected, and it is not perhaps generally known, that the character\r\nwhich we at this day place at the head of our prescriptions, and which\r\nis understood, and supposed to mean _Recipe_, is a relict of the\r\nastrological symbol of Jupiter, as may be seen in many of the older\r\nworks on pharmacy, although it is at present so disguised by the\r\naddition of the down stroke, which converts it into the letter ℞, that\r\nwere it not for its _cloven_ foot, we might be led to question the fact\r\nof its superstitious origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA knowledge of this ancient and popular belief in Sideral influence,\r\nwill enable us to explain many superstitions in Physic; the custom, for\r\ninstance, of administering cathartic medicines at stated periods and\r\nseasons, originated in an impression of their being more active at\r\nparticular stages of the moon, or at certain conjunctions of the\r\nplanets: a remnant of this superstition still exists to a considerable\r\nextent in Germany; and the practice of bleeding at ‘spring and fall,’ so\r\nlong observed in this country, owed its existence to a similar belief.\r\nIt was in consequence of the same superstition, that the metals were\r\nfirst distinguished by the names and signs of the planets; and as the\r\nlatter were supposed to hold dominion over time, so were astrologers led\r\nto believe that some, more than others, had an influence on certain days\r\nof the week; and, moreover, that they could impart to the corresponding\r\nmetals considerable efficacy upon the particular days which were devoted\r\nto them;[24] from the same belief, some bodies were only prepared on\r\ncertain days in the year; the celebrated earth of Lemnos was, as Galen\r\ndescribes, periodically dug with great ceremony, and it continued for\r\nmany ages to be highly esteemed for its virtues; even at this day, the\r\npit in which the clay is found is annually opened, with solemn rites by\r\nthe priests, on the sixth day of August, six hours after sun rising,\r\nwhen a quantity is taken out, washed, dried, and then sealed with the\r\nGrand Signior’s seal, and sent to Constantinople. Formerly it was death\r\nto open the pit, or to seal the earth, on any other day in the year. In\r\nthe botanical history of the middle ages, as more especially developed\r\nin Macer’s Herbal, there was not a plant of medicinal use, that was not\r\nplaced under the dominion of some planet, and must neither be gathered\r\nnor applied but with observances that savoured of the most absurd\r\nsuperstition, and which we find were preserved as late as the\r\nseventeenth century, by the astrological herbalists, Turner, Culpepper,\r\nand Lovel.\r\n\r\nIt is not the least extraordinary feature in the history of medical\r\nsuperstition, that it should so frequently involve in its trammels\r\npersons who, on every other occasion, would resent with indignation any\r\nattempt to talk them out of their reason, and still more so, to persuade\r\nthem out of their senses; and yet we have continual proofs of its\r\nextensive influence over powerful and cultivated minds; in ancient times\r\nwe may adduce the wise Cicero, and the no less philosophical Aurelius,\r\nwhile in modern days we need only recall to our recollection the number\r\nof persons of superior rank and intelligence, who were actually\r\npersuaded to submit to the magnetising operations of Miss Prescott, and\r\nsome of them were even induced to believe that a beneficial influence\r\nhad been produced by the spells of this modern Circe.\r\n\r\nLord Bacon, with all his philosophy, betrayed a disposition to believe\r\nin the virtue of charms and amulets; and Boyle[25] seriously recommends\r\nthe thigh bone of an executed criminal, as a powerful remedy in\r\ndysentery. Amongst the remedies of Sir Theodore Mayerne, known to\r\ncommentators as the Doctor Caius of Shakspeare, who was physician to\r\nthree English Sovereigns, and who, by his personal authority, put an end\r\nto the distinctions of chemical and galenical practitioners in England,\r\nwe shall find the secundines of a woman in her first labour with a male\r\nchild; the bowels of a mole, cut open alive; mummy made of the lungs of\r\na man who had died a violent death; with a variety of remedies, equally\r\nabsurd, and alike disgusting.\r\n\r\nIt merits notice, that the medicinal celebrity of a substance has not\r\nunfrequently survived the tradition of its superstitious origin, in the\r\nsame manner that many of our popular customs and rites have continued,\r\nthrough a series of years, to exact a respectful observance, although\r\nthe circumstances which gave origin to them have been obscured and lost\r\nin the gloom of unrecorded ages. Does not the fond parent still suspend\r\nthe coral toy around the neck of her infant, without being in the least\r\naware of the superstitious belief[26] from which the custom originated?\r\nwhile the chorus of _derry down_ is re-echoed by those who never heard\r\nof the Druids, much less of the choral hymns with which their groves\r\nresounded, at the time of their gathering the misletoe; and how many a\r\nmedical practitioner continues to administer this sacred plant, (_Viscus\r\nQuercinus_) for the cure of his epileptic patients, without the least\r\nsuspicion that it owes its reputation to the same mysterious source of\r\nsuperstition and imposture? Nor is this the only faint vestige of\r\ndruidism which can be adduced. Mr. Lightfoot states, with much\r\nplausibility, that in the highlands of Scotland, evidence still exists\r\nin proof of the high esteem in which those ancient Magi held the Quicken\r\ntree, or Mountain Ash, (_Sorbus Aucuparia_) for it is more frequently\r\nthan any other, found planted in the neighbourhood of druidical circles\r\nof stones; and it is a curious fact, that it should be still believed\r\nthat a small part of this tree, carried about a person, is a charm\r\nagainst all bodily evils,—the dairy-maid drives the cattle with a switch\r\nof the _Roan_ tree, for so it is called in the highlands; and in one\r\npart of Scotland, the sheep and lambs are, on the first of May, ever\r\nmade to pass through a hoop of _Roan wood_.\r\n\r\nIt is also necessary to state, that many of the practices which\r\nsuperstition has at different times suggested, have not been alike\r\nabsurd; nay, some of them have even possessed, by accident, natural\r\npowers of considerable efficacy, whilst others, although, ridiculous in\r\nthemselves, have actually led to results and discoveries of great\r\npractical importance. The most remarkable instance of this kind upon\r\nrecord is that of the _Sympathetic_ powder of Sir Kenelm Digby,[27]\r\nKnight of Montpellier. Whenever any wound had been inflicted, this\r\npowder was applied to the weapon that had inflicted it, which was,\r\nmoreover, covered with ointment, and dressed two or three times\r\na-day.[28] The wound itself in the mean time was directed to be brought\r\ntogether, and carefully bound up with clean linen rags, but, ABOVE ALL,\r\nTO BE LET ALONE for seven days; at the end of which period the bandages\r\nwere removed, when the wound was generally found perfectly united. The\r\ntriumph of the cure was decreed to the mysterious agency of the\r\nsympathetic powder which had been so assiduously applied to the weapon;\r\nwhereas, it is hardly necessary to observe, that the promptness of the\r\ncure depended upon the total exclusion of air from the wound, and upon\r\nthe sanative operations of nature not having received any disturbance\r\nfrom the officious interference of art; the result, beyond all doubt,\r\nfurnished the first hint, which led surgeons to the improved practice of\r\nhealing wounds by what is technically called the _first intention_.\r\n\r\nThe rust of the spear of Telephus, mentioned in Homer as a cure for the\r\nwounds which that weapon inflicted, was probably _Verdegris_, and led to\r\nthe discovery of its use as a surgical application.\r\n\r\nSoon after the introduction of Gunpowder, _cold water_ was very\r\ngenerally employed throughout Italy, as a dressing to gun-shot wounds;\r\nnot however from any theory connected with the influence of diminished\r\ntemperature or of moisture, but from a belief in a supernatural agency\r\nimparted to it by certain mysterious and magical ceremonies, which were\r\nduly performed immediately previous to its application: the continuance\r\nof the practice, however, threw some light upon the surgical treatment\r\nof these wounds, and led to a more rational management of them.\r\n\r\nThe inoculation of the small-pox in India, Turkey, and Wales, observes\r\nSir Gilbert Blane, was practised on a superstitious principle, long\r\nbefore it was introduced as a rational practice into this country. The\r\nsuperstition consisted in buying it—for the efficacy of the operation,\r\nin giving safety, was supposed to depend upon a piece of money being\r\nleft by the person who took it for insertion. The members of the\r\nNational Vaccine Establishment, during the period I had a seat at the\r\nboard, received from Mr. Dubois, a Missionary in India, a very\r\ninteresting account of the services, derived from superstitious\r\ninfluence, in propagating the practice of vaccination through that\r\nuncivilized part of the globe. It appears from this document, that the\r\ngreatest obstacle which vaccination encountered was a belief that the\r\nnatural small-pox was a dispensation of a mischievous deity among them,\r\nwhom they called MAH-RY UMMA, or rather, that this disease was an\r\nincarnation of the dire Goddess herself, into the person who was\r\ninfected with it; the fear of irritating her, and of exposing themselves\r\nto her resentment, necessarily rendered the natives of the East\r\ndecidedly averse to vaccination, until a superstitious impression,\r\nequally powerful with respect to the new practice, was happily effected;\r\nthis was no other than a belief, that the Goddess MAH-RY UMMA had\r\nspontaneously chosen this new and milder mode of manifesting herself to\r\nher votaries, and that she might be worshipped with equal respect under\r\nthis new shape.\r\n\r\nHYDROMANCY is another superstition which has incidentally led to the\r\ndiscovery of the medicinal virtues of many mineral waters; a belief in\r\nthe divining nature of certain springs and fountains is, perhaps, the\r\nmost ancient and universal of all superstitions. The Castalian fountain,\r\nand many others amongst the Grecians, were supposed to be of a prophetic\r\nnature; by dipping a fair mirror into a well, the Patræans of Greece\r\nreceived, as they imagined, some notice of ensuing sickness or health.\r\nAt this very day, the sick and lame are attracted to various hallowed\r\nsprings; and to this practice, which has been observed for so many ages\r\nand in such different countries, we are no doubt indebted for a\r\nknowledge of the sanative powers of many mineral waters. There can be no\r\ndoubt, moreover, but that in many cases, by affording encouragement and\r\nconfidence to a dejected patient, and serenity to his mind, whether by\r\nthe aid of reason or the influence of superstition, much benefit may\r\narise; for the salutary and curative efforts of nature, in such a state\r\nof mind, must be much more likely to succeed; equally evident is it,\r\nthat the most powerful effects may be induced by the administration of\r\nremedies which, from their disgusting nature, are calculated to excite\r\nstrong and painful sensations of the mind.[29] Celsus mentions, with\r\nconfidence, several medicines of this kind for the cure of Epilepsy, as\r\n_the warm blood of a recently slain Gladiator_, or a certain portion of\r\n_human_, or _horse flesh_! and we find that remedies of this description\r\nwere actually exhibited, and with success, by Kaw Boerhaave, in the cure\r\nof Epileptics in the poor-house at Haerlem. The powerful influence of\r\nconfidence in the cure and prevention of disease, was well understood by\r\nthe sages of antiquity; the Romans, in times of pestilence, elected a\r\ndictator with great solemnity, for the sole purpose of driving a nail\r\ninto the wall of the temple of Jupiter—the effect was generally\r\ninstantaneous—and while they thus imagined that they propitiated an\r\noffended deity, they in truth did but diminish the susceptibility to\r\ndisease, by appeasing their own fears. Nor are there wanting in modern\r\ntimes, striking examples of the progress of an epidemic disease having\r\nbeen suddenly arrested by some exhilarating impression made upon the\r\nmass of the population.\r\n\r\nIn the celebrated siege of Breda, in 1625, by Spinola, the garrison\r\nsuffered extreme distress from the ravages of Scurvy, and the Prince of\r\nOrange being unable to relieve the place, sent in, by a confidential\r\nmessenger, a preparation which was directed to be added to a very large\r\nquantity of water, and to be given as a specific for the epidemic; the\r\nremedy was administered, and the garrison recovered its health, when it\r\nwas afterwards acknowledged, that the substance in question was no other\r\nthan a little colouring matter.\r\n\r\nAmongst the numerous instances which have been cited to shew the power\r\nof faith over disease, or of the mind over the body, the _cures\r\nperformed by Royal Touch_[30] have been generally selected; but it would\r\nappear, upon the authority of Wiseman, that the cures which were thus\r\neffected, were in reality produced by a very different cause; for he\r\nstates, that part of the duty of the Royal Physicians and Serjeant\r\nSurgeons was to select such patients, afflicted with scrofula, as\r\nevinced a tendency towards recovery, and that they took especial care to\r\nchoose those who approached the age of puberty; in short, those only\r\nwere produced whom nature had shewn a disposition to cure; and as the\r\ntouch of the king, like the sympathetic powder of Digby, secured the\r\npatient from the mischievous importunities of art, so were the efforts\r\nof nature left free and uncontrolled, and the cure of the disease was\r\nnot retarded or opposed by the operation of adverse remedies. The\r\nwonderful cures of Valentine Greatracks, performed in 1666, which were\r\nwitnessed by cotemporary prelates, members of parliament, and fellows of\r\nthe royal society, amongst whom was the celebrated Mr. Boyle, would\r\nprobably upon investigation admit of a similar explanation; it deserves,\r\nhowever, to be noticed, that in all records of extraordinary cures\r\nperformed by mysterious agents, there is a great desire to conceal the\r\nremedies and other curative means, which were simultaneously\r\nadministered with them; thus Oribasius commends in high terms a necklace\r\nof _Pœony root_, for the cure of Epilepsy; but we learn that he always\r\ntook care to accompany its use with copious evacuations, although he\r\nassigns to them no share of credit in the cure. In later times we have a\r\ngood specimen of this deception presented to us in a work on Scrofula,\r\nby Mr. Morley, written, as we are informed, for the sole purpose of\r\nrestoring the much injured character and use of the _Vervain_; in which\r\nthe author directs the root of this plant to be tied with a _yard of\r\nwhited satin ribband_, around the neck, where it is to remain until the\r\npatient is cured; but mark,—during this interval he calls to his aid the\r\nmost active medicines in the materia medica!\r\n\r\nThe advantages which I have stated to have occasionally arisen from\r\nsuperstitious influence, must be understood as being generally\r\naccidental; indeed, in the history of superstitious practices, we do not\r\nfind that their application was exclusively commended in cases likely to\r\nbe influenced by the powers of faith or of the imagination, but, on the\r\ncontrary, that they were as frequently directed in affections that were\r\nentirely placed beyond the control of the mind. Homer tells us, for\r\ninstance, that the bleeding of Ulysses was stopped by a charm:[31] and\r\nCato the censor has favoured us with an incantation for the reduction of\r\na dislocated limb. In certain instances, however, we are certainly bound\r\nto admit that the pagan priesthood, with their characteristic cunning,\r\nwere careful to perform their superstitious incantations, in such cases\r\nonly as were likely to receive the sanative assistance of Nature, so\r\nthat they might attribute the fortunate results of her efforts, to the\r\npotent influence of their own arts. The extraordinary success which is\r\nrelated to have attended various superstitious ceremonials will thus\r\nfind a plausible explanation: the miraculous gift, attributed by\r\nHerodotus to the Priestesses of Helen, is one amongst many others of\r\nthis kind that might be adduced; the Grecian historian relates, that\r\nwhen the heads of ugly infants were adjusted on the altar of this\r\ntemple, the individuals so treated acquired comeliness, and even beauty,\r\nas they advanced in growth: but is not such a change the ordinary and\r\nunassisted result of natural developement? Those large and prominent\r\noutlines which impart an unpleasing physiognomy to the infant, when\r\nproportioned and matured by growth, will generally assume features of\r\nintelligence in the adult face.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude these observations, by remarking that, in the history\r\nof religious ceremonials, we sometimes discover that they were intended\r\nto preserve useful customs or to conceal important truths; which, had\r\nthey not been thus _embalmed_ by superstition, could never have been\r\nperpetuated for the use and advantage of posterity. I shall illustrate\r\nthis assertion by one or two examples. Whenever the ancients proposed to\r\nbuild a town, or to pitch a camp, a sacrifice was offered to the gods,\r\nand the Soothsayer declared, _from the appearance of the entrails_,\r\nwhether they were propitious or not to the design. What was this but a\r\nphysiological inquiry into the salubrity of the situation, and the\r\npurity of the waters that supplied it? for we well know that in\r\nunwholesome districts, especially when swampy, the cattle will uniformly\r\npresent an appearance of disease in the viscera, which an experienced\r\neye can readily detect; and when we reflect upon the age and climate in\r\nwhich these ceremonies were performed, we cannot but believe that their\r\nintroduction was suggested by principles of wise and useful policy. In\r\nthe same manner, _Bathing_, which at one period of the world, was\r\nessentially necessary, to prevent the diffusion of Leprosy, and other\r\ninfectious diseases, was wisely converted into an act of religion, and\r\nthe priests persuaded the people that they could only obtain absolution\r\non washing away their sins by frequent ablutions; but since the use of\r\nlinen shirts has become general, and every one has provided for the\r\ncleanliness of his own person, the frequent bath ceases to be so\r\nessential, and therefore no evil has arisen from the change of religious\r\nbelief respecting its connection with the welfare and purity of the\r\nsoul. Among the religious impurities and rules of purification of the\r\nHindoos, we shall be able to discern the same principle although\r\ndistorted by the grossest superstition. The ancient custom of erecting\r\n“_Acerræ_” or Altars, near the bed of the deceased, in order that his\r\nfriends might daily _burn Incense_ until his burial, was long practised\r\nby the Romans. The Chinese observe a similar custom; they place upon the\r\naltar thus erected an image of the dead person, to which every one who\r\napproaches it bows four times, and offers oblations and _perfumes_. Can\r\nthere be any difficulty in recognising, in this tribute to the dead, a\r\nwise provision for the preservation of the living? The original\r\nintention was, beyond doubt, to overcome any offensive smell, and to\r\nobviate the dangers that might arise from the emanations of the corpse.\r\nThese instances are sufficient to shew the justness of my position: if\r\ntime and space would allow, many others of a striking and interesting\r\ncharacter might be adduced.[32]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CREDULITY.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is nearly allied to Superstition, yet it differs very widely\r\nfrom it. Credulity is an unbounded belief in what is possible, although\r\ndestitute of proof and perhaps of probability; but Superstition is a\r\nbelief in what is wholly repugnant to the laws of the physical and moral\r\nworld. Thus, if we believe that an inert plant possesses any remedial\r\npower, we are _credulous_; but if we were to fancy that, by carrying it\r\nabout with us, we should become invulnerable, we should in that case be\r\n_superstitious_. Credulity is a far greater source of error than\r\nSuperstition; for the latter must be always more limited in its\r\ninfluence, and can exist only, to any considerable extent, in the most\r\nignorant portion of society; whereas the former diffuses itself through\r\nthe minds of all classes, by which the rank and dignity of science are\r\ndegraded, its valuable labours confounded with the vain pretensions of\r\nempiricism, and ignorance is enabled to claim for itself the\r\nprescriptive right of delivering oracles, amidst all the triumphs of\r\ntruth, and the progress of philosophy. This is very lamentable; and yet,\r\nif it were even possible to remove the film that thus obscures the\r\npublic discernment, I question whether the adoption of such a plan would\r\nnot be outvoted by the majority of our own profession. In Chili, says\r\nZimmerman, the physicians blow around the beds of their patients to\r\ndrive away diseases; and as the people in that country believe that\r\nphysic consists wholly in this wind, their doctors would take it very\r\nill of any person who should attempt to make the method of cure more\r\ndifficult—_they think they know enough, when they know how to blow_.\r\n\r\nBut this mental imbecility is not characteristic of any age or country.\r\nEngland has, indeed, by a late continental writer,[33] been accused of\r\npossessing a larger share of credulity than its neighbours, and it has\r\nbeen emphatically called “_The Paradise of Quacks_,” but with as little\r\ntruth as candour. If we refer to the works of Ætius, written more than\r\n1300 years ago, we shall discover the existence of a similar infirmity\r\nwith regard to physic. This author has collected a multitude of\r\nreceipts, particularly those that had been celebrated, or used as\r\n_Nostrums_,[34] many of which he mentions with no other view than to\r\nexpose their folly, and to inform us at what an extravagant price they\r\nwere purchased. We accordingly learn from him that the collyrium of\r\nDanaus was sold at Constantinople for 120 numismata, and the cholical\r\nantidote of Nicostratus for two talents; in short, we shall find an\r\nunbounded credulity with respect to the powers of inert medicines, from\r\nthe elixir and _alkahest_ of Paracelsus and Van-Helmont, to the tar\r\nwater of bishop Berkeley, the metallic tractors of Perkins, the animal\r\nmagnetism of Miss Prescott, and may I not add, with equal justice, to\r\nthe nitro-muriatic acid bath of Dr. Scott? The description of Thessalus,\r\nthe Roman empiric in the reign of Nero, as drawn by Galen, applies with\r\nequal fidelity and force to the medical Charlatan of the present day;\r\nand, if we examine the writings of Scribonius Largus, we shall obtain\r\nample evidence that the same ungenerous selfishness of keeping medicines\r\nsecret, prevailed in ancient no less than in modern times; while we have\r\nonly to read the sacred orations of Aristides to be satisfied, that the\r\nflagrant conduct of the Asclepiades, from which he so severely\r\nsuffered,[35] was the very prototype of the cruel and remorseless\r\nfrauds, so wickedly practised by the unprincipled Quack Doctors and\r\nadvertising “_Medical Boards_,” of our own times: and I challenge the\r\napologist of ancient purity to produce a more glaring instance of\r\nempirical effrontery and success, in the annals of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, than that of the sacred impostor described in the Alexander of\r\nLucian, who established himself in the deserted temple of Esculapius,\r\nand entrapped in his snares some of the most eminent of the Roman\r\nsenators.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SCEPTICISM.\r\n\r\nCredulity has been justly defined, _Belief without Reason_. Scepticism\r\nis its opposite, _Reason without Belief_ and is the natural and\r\ninvariable consequence of credulity: for it may be generally observed,\r\nthat men who believe without reason, are succeeded by others whom no\r\nreasoning can convince; a fact which has occasioned many extraordinary\r\nand violent revolutions in the _Materia Medica_, and a knowledge of it\r\nwill enable us to explain the otherwise unaccountable rise and fall of\r\nmany useless, as well as important articles. It will also suggest to the\r\nreflecting practitioner, a caution of great moment, to avoid the\r\ndangerous fault imputed to Galen by Dioscorides, of ascribing too many\r\nand too great virtues to one and the same medicine. _By bestowing\r\nunworthy and extravagant praise upon a remedy, we in reality do but\r\ndetract from its reputation,[36] and run the risk of banishing it from\r\npractice_; for when the sober practitioner discovers by experience that\r\na medicine falls so far short of the efficacy ascribed to it, he\r\nabandons its use in disgust, and is even unwilling to concede to it that\r\ndegree of merit to which in truth and justice it may be entitled; the\r\ninflated eulogiums bestowed upon the operation of _Digitalis_ in\r\npulmonary diseases, excited, for a time, a very unfair impression\r\nagainst its use; and the injudicious manner in which the antisyphilitic\r\npowers of _Nitric Acid_ have been aggrandised, had very nearly exploded\r\na valuable auxiliary from modern practice.\r\n\r\nIt is well known with what avidity the public embraced the expectations\r\ngiven by Stöerk of Vienna in 1760, with respect to the efficacy of\r\n_Hemlock_; every body, says Dr. Fothergill, made the extract, and every\r\nbody prescribed it, but finding that it would not perform the wonders\r\nascribed to it, and that a multitude of discordant diseases refused to\r\nyield, as it was asserted they would, to its narcotic powers,\r\npractitioners fell into the opposite extreme of absurdity, and declaring\r\nthat it could do nothing at all, dismissed it at once as inert and\r\nuseless. Can we not then predict the fate of the _Cubebs_, which has\r\nbeen lately restored to notice with such extravagant praise and\r\nunqualified approbation? May the sanguine advocates for the virtues of\r\nthe Colchicum derive a useful lesson of practical caution from these\r\nprecepts: it would be a matter of regret that a remedy which, under\r\nskilful management, certainly possesses considerable virtue, should\r\nagain fall into obscurity and neglect from the disgust excited by the\r\nextravagant zeal of its supporters.\r\n\r\nThere are, moreover, those who cherish a spirit of scepticism, from an\r\nidea that it denotes the exercise of a superior intellect; it must be\r\nadmitted, that at that period in the history of Europe, when reason\r\nfirst began to throw off the yoke of authority, it required superiority\r\nof understanding as well as intrepidity of conduct, to resist the powers\r\nof that superstition which had so long held it in captivity; but in the\r\npresent age, observes Mr. Dugald Stewart, “_unlimited scepticism is as\r\nmuch the child of imbecility as implicit credulity_.” “He who at the end\r\nof the eighteenth century,” says Rousseau, “has brought himself to\r\nabandon all his early principles, without discrimination, would probably\r\nhave been a bigot in the days of the league.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                  FALSE THEORIES, AND ABSURD CONCEITS.\r\n\r\nHe who is governed by preconceived opinions, may be compared to a\r\nspectator who views the surrounding objects through coloured glasses,\r\neach assuming a tinge similar to that of the glass employed; thus have\r\ncrowds of inert and insignificant drugs been indebted to an ephemeral\r\npopularity, from the prevalence of a false theory; the celebrated\r\nhypothesis of Galen respecting the virtues and operation of medicines,\r\nmay serve as an example; it is a web of philosophical fiction, which was\r\nnever surpassed in absurdity. He conceives that the properties of all\r\nmedicines are derived from what he calls their elementary or _cardinal_\r\nqualities, HEAT, COLD, MOISTURE, and DRYNESS. Each of these qualities is\r\nagain sub-divided into four degrees, and a plant or medicine, according\r\nto his notion, is cold or hot, in the first, second, third, or fourth\r\ngradation; if the disease be hot, or cold in any of these four stages, a\r\nmedicine possessed of a contrary quality, and in the same proportionate\r\ndegree of elementary heat or cold, must be prescribed. Saltness,\r\nbitterness, and acridness depend, in his idea, upon the relative degrees\r\nof heat and dryness in different bodies. It will be easily seen how a\r\nbelief in such an hypothesis must have multiplied the list of inert\r\narticles in the materia medica, and have corrupted the practice of\r\nphysic. The variety of seeds derived its origin from this source, and\r\nuntil lately, medical writers, in the true jargon of Galen, spoke of the\r\n_four_ greater and lesser _hot_ and _cold_ seeds; and in the London\r\nDispensatory of 1721, we find the powders of _hot_ and _cold_ precious\r\nstones, and those of the _hot_ and _cold_ compound powders of pearl.\r\nSeveral of the ancient combinations of opium, with various aromatics,\r\nare also indebted to Galen for their origin, and to the blind influence\r\nof his authority for their existence and lasting reputation. Galen\r\nasserted that opium was _cold in the fourth degree_, and must therefore\r\nrequire some corresponding hot medicine to moderate its frigidity.[37]\r\n\r\nTHE METHODIC SECT, which was founded by the Roman physician\r\nThemison,[38] a disciple of Asclepiades, as they conceived all diseases\r\nto depend upon _overbracing_, or on _relaxation_, so did they class all\r\nmedicines under the head of _relaxing_ and _bracing_ remedies; and\r\nalthough this theory has been long since banished from the schools, yet\r\nit continues at this day to exert a secret influence on medical\r\npractice, and to preserve from neglect some unimportant medicines. The\r\ngeneral belief in the relaxing effect of the _warm_, and the equally\r\nstrengthening influence of the _cold_ bath, may be traced to conclusions\r\ndeduced from the operations of hot and cold water upon parchment and\r\nother inert bodies.[39]\r\n\r\nTHE STAHLIANS, under the impression of their ideal system, introduced\r\n_Archœal_ remedies, and many of a superstitious and inert kind; whilst,\r\nas they on all occasions trusted to the constant attention and wisdom of\r\nnature, so did they zealously oppose the use of some of the most\r\nefficacious instruments of art, as the Peruvian _bark_; and few\r\nphysicians were so reserved in the use of general remedies, as bleeding,\r\nvomiting, and the like; their practice was therefore imbecile, and it\r\nhas been aptly enough denominated, “_a meditation upon death_.” They\r\nwere however vigilant in observation and acute in discernment, and we\r\nare indebted to them for some faithful and minute descriptions.\r\n\r\nTHE MECHANICAL THEORY, which recognised “_lentor and morbid viscidity of\r\nthe blood_,” as the principal cause of all diseases, introduced\r\nattenuant and diluent medicines, or substances endued with some\r\nmechanical force; thus Fourcroy explained the operation of mercury by\r\nits specific gravity,[40] and the advocates of this doctrine favoured\r\nthe general introduction of the preparations of iron, especially in\r\nschirrus of the spleen or liver, upon the same hypothetical principle;\r\nfor, say they, whatever is most forcible in removing the obstruction,\r\nmust be the most proper instrument of cure; such is _Steel_, which,\r\nbesides the attenuating power with which it is furnished, has still a\r\ngreater force in this case from the _gravity_ of its particles, which,\r\nbeing seven times specifically heavier than any vegetable, acts in\r\nproportion with a stronger impulse, and therefore is a more powerful\r\ndeobstruent. This may be taken as a specimen of the style in which these\r\nmechanical physicians reasoned and practised.\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMISTS, as they acknowledged no source of disease but the presence\r\nof some hostile acid or alkali, or some deranged condition in the\r\nchemical composition of the fluid or solid parts, so they conceived all\r\nremedies must act by producing chemical changes in the body. We find\r\nTournefort busily engaged in testing every vegetable juice, in order to\r\ndiscover in it some traces of an acid or alkaline ingredient, which\r\nmight confer upon it medicinal activity. The fatal errors into which\r\nsuch an hypothesis was liable to betray the practitioner, receive an\r\nawful illustration in the history of the memorable fever that raged at\r\nLeyden in the year 1699, and which consigned two thirds of the\r\npopulation of that city to an untimely grave; an event which, in a great\r\nmeasure, depended upon the Professor Sylvius de la Boe, who having just\r\nembraced the chemical doctrines of Van Helmont, assigned the origin of\r\nthe distemper to a prevailing acid, and declared that its cure could\r\nalone be effected by the copious administration of absorbent and\r\ntestaceous medicines; an extravagance into which Van Helmont, himself,\r\nwould hardly have been betrayed:—but thus it is in Philosophy, as in\r\nPolitics, that the partisans of a popular leader are always more\r\nsanguine, and less reasonable, than their master; they are not only\r\nready to delude the world, but most anxious to deceive themselves, and\r\nwhile they warmly defend their favourite system from the attacks of\r\nthose that may assail it, they willingly close their own eyes, and\r\nconceal from themselves the different points that are untenable; or, to\r\nborrow the figurative language of a French writer, they are like the\r\npious children of Noah,[41] who went backwards, that they might not see\r\nthe nakedness which they approached for the purpose of covering.\r\n\r\nUnlike the mechanical physicians, the chemists explain the beneficial\r\noperation of iron by supposing that it increases the proportion of red\r\nglobules in the blood, on the erroneous[42] hypothesis that iron\r\nconstitutes the principal element of these bodies. Thus has iron, from\r\nits acknowledged powers, been enlisted into the service of every\r\nprevailing hypothesis; and it is not a little singular, as a late writer\r\nhas justly observed, that theories however different, and even adverse,\r\ndo nevertheless often coincide in matters of practice, as well with each\r\nother as with long established empirical usages, each bending as it\r\nwere, and conforming, in order to do homage to truth and experience. And\r\nyet iron, whose medicinal virtues have been so generally allowed, has\r\nnot escaped those vicissitudes in reputation which almost every valuable\r\nremedy has been doomed to suffer: at one period the ancients imagined\r\nthat wounds inflicted by iron instruments, were never disposed to heal,\r\nfor which reason Porsenna, after the expulsion of the Tarquins, actually\r\nstipulated with the Romans that they should not use iron, except in\r\nagriculture; and Avicenna was so alarmed at the idea of its internal use\r\nas a remedy, when given in substance, that he seriously advised the\r\nexhibition of a magnet[43] after it to prevent any direful consequences.\r\nThe fame even of Peruvian bark has been occasionally obscured by the\r\nclouds of false theory some condemned its use altogether, “because it\r\ndid not evacuate the morbific matter,” others, “because it bred\r\nobstructions in the viscera,” others again, “because it only bound up\r\nthe spirits, and stopped the paroxysms for a time, and favoured the\r\ntranslation of the peccant matter into the more noble parts.” Thus we\r\nlearn from Morton,[44] that Oliver Cromwell fell a victim to an\r\nintermittent fever, because the Physicians were too timid to make a\r\ntrial of the bark. It was sold first by the Jesuits for its weight in\r\nsilver;[45] and Condamine relates that in 1690, about thirty years\r\nafterwards, several thousand pounds of it lay at Piura and Payta for\r\nwant of a purchaser.\r\n\r\nNor has Sugar escaped the venom of fanciful hypothesis. Dr. Willis\r\nraised a popular outcry against its domestic use, declaring that “it\r\ncontained within its particles a secret acid—a dangerous\r\nsharpness,—which caused scurvys, consumptions, and other dreadful\r\ndiseases.”[46]\r\n\r\nAlthough I profess to offer merely a few illustrations of those\r\ndoctrines, whose perverted applications have influenced the history of\r\nthe Materia Medica, I cannot pass over in silence that of John Brown,\r\n“the child of genius and misfortune.” As he generalized diseases, and\r\nbrought all within the compass of two grand classes, those of\r\n_increased_ and _diminished_ excitement, so did he abridge our remedies,\r\nmaintaining, that every agent which could operate on the human body was\r\na _Stimulant_, having an identity of action, and differing only in the\r\ndegree of its force; so that, according to his views, the lancet and the\r\nbrandy bottle were but the opposite extremes of one and the same class:\r\nthe mischievous tendency of such a doctrine is too obvious to require a\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\nBut the most absurd and preposterous hypothesis that has disgraced the\r\nannals of medicine, and bestowed medicinal reputation upon substances of\r\nno intrinsic worth, is that of the DOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES, as it has\r\nbeen called, which is no less than a belief that _every natural\r\nsubstance which possesses any medicinal virtue, indicates by an obvious\r\nand well-marked external character, the disease for which it is a\r\nremedy, or the object for which it should be employed_![47] This\r\nextraordinary monster of the fancy has been principally adopted and\r\ncherished by Paracelsus, Baptista Porta, and Crollius, although traces\r\nof its existence may be certainly discovered in very ancient authors.\r\nThe root of the _Mandrake_, from its supposed resemblance to the human\r\nform, was esteemed as a remedy for Sterility: thus did Rachael demand\r\nfrom her sister the Mandrakes (_Dudaim_) which Reuben had gathered in\r\nthe field; impressed, as it would appear, with a belief in the efficacy\r\nof that plant against barrenness.[48] There would moreover appear in\r\nthis case to have been some idea of additional virtue arising from the\r\nperson who gathered it, for great stress was laid upon this\r\ncircumstance, “_my son’s_ Mandrakes:” such a notion is by no means\r\nuncommon in the history of charms. The supposed virtues of the _Lapis\r\nÆtites_, or _Eagle stone_,[49] described by Dioscorides, Ætius and\r\nPliny, who assert that if tied to the arm it will prevent abortion, and\r\nif fixed to the thigh forward delivery, were, as we learn from ancient\r\nauthority, solely suggested by the manner in which the nodule contained\r\nwithin the stone moves and rattles, whenever it is shaken. “_Ætites\r\nlapis agitatus, sonitum edit, velut ex altero lapide prægnans._” The\r\nconceit however did not assume the importance of a theory until the end\r\nof the fourteenth century, at which period we find several authors\r\nengaged in the support of its truth, and it will not be unamusing to\r\noffer a specimen of their sophistry; they affirm, that since man is the\r\nlord of the creation, all other creatures are designed for his use, and\r\n_therefore_, that their beneficial qualities and excellencies must be\r\nexpressed by such characters as can be seen and understood by every one;\r\nand as man discovers his reason by speech, and brutes their sensations\r\nby various sounds, motions, and gestures, so the vast variety and\r\ndiversity of figures, colours, and consistencies, observable in\r\ninanimate creatures, is certainly designed for some wise purpose. It\r\n_must be_, in order to manifest these peculiar qualities and\r\nexcellencies, which could not be so effectually done in any other way,\r\nnot even by speech, since no language is universal. Thus, the lungs of a\r\nfox must be a specific for asthma, _because_ that animal is remarkable\r\nfor its strong powers of respiration. _Turmerick_ has a brilliant yellow\r\ncolour, which indicates that it has the power of curing the jaundice; by\r\nthe same rule, _Poppies_ must relieve diseases of the head; _Agaricus_\r\nthose of the bladder; _Cassia fistula_ the affections of the intestines,\r\nand _Aristolochia_ the disorders of the uterus: the polished surface and\r\nstony hardness which so eminently characterise the seeds of the\r\n_Lithospermum Officinale_ (Common Gromwell) were deemed a certain\r\nindication of their efficacy in calculous and gravelly disorders; for a\r\nsimilar reason the roots of the _Saxifraga Granulata_ (White Saxifrage)\r\ngained reputation in the cure of the same disease; and the _Euphrasia_\r\n(Eye-bright) acquired fame, as an application in complaints of the eye,\r\nbecause it exhibits a black spot in its corolla resembling the pupil.\r\n\r\nIn the curious work of _Chrysostom Magnenus_, we meet with a whimsical\r\naccount of the _Signature_ of Tobacco. “In the first place,” says he,\r\n“the manner in which the flowers adhere to the head of the plant\r\nindicates the _Infundibulum Cerebri_, and _Pituitary Gland_. In the next\r\nplace, the three membranes of which its leaves are composed announce\r\ntheir value to the stomach which has three membranes.”[50]\r\n\r\nThe blood-stone, the _Heliotropium_ of the ancients, from the occasional\r\nsmall specks or points of a blood red colour exhibited on its green\r\nsurface, is even at this day employed in many parts of England and\r\nScotland, to stop a bleeding from the nose; and nettle-tea continues a\r\npopular remedy for the cure of _Urticaria_. It is also asserted that\r\nsome substances bear the SIGNATURES of the humours, as the petals of the\r\nred rose that of the blood, and the roots of rhubarb and the flowers of\r\nsaffron, that of the bile.[51]\r\n\r\nI apprehend that John of Gaddesden, in the fourteenth century,\r\ncelebrated by Chaucer, must have been directed by some remote analogy of\r\nthis kind, when he ordered the son of Edward the First, who was\r\ndangerously ill with the small-pox, to be wrapped in scarlet cloth, as\r\nwell as all those who attended upon him, or came into his presence, and\r\neven the bed and room in which he was laid were covered with the same\r\ndrapery; and so completely did it answer, say the credulous historians\r\nof that day, that the Prince was cured without having so much as a\r\nsingle mark left upon him.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the conceits of Physic, as relating to the Materia\r\nMedica, we must not pass over the idea, so prevalent at one period, that\r\n_all poisonous substances possess a powerful and mutual elective\r\nattraction for each other_; and that consequently, if a substance of\r\nthis kind were suspended around the neck, it would, by intercepting and\r\nabsorbing every noxious particle, preserve the body from the virulence\r\nof contagious matter. Angelus Sala, accordingly, gives us a formula for\r\nwhat he terms his _Magnes Arsenicalis_, which he asserts will not only\r\ndefend the body from the influence of poison, but will, from its powers\r\nof attraction, draw out the venom from an infected person. In the\r\ncelebrated plague of London, we are informed that amulets of arsenic\r\nwere upon this principle suspended over the region of the heart, as a\r\npreservative against infection.\r\n\r\nThere is yet to be mentioned another absurd conceit which long existed\r\nrespecting the subject of Antidotes,—a belief that every natural poison\r\ncarried within itself its own antidote; thus we learn from the writings\r\nof Dioscorides, Galen, and Pliny, that the _virus_ of the _Cantharis\r\nVesicatoria_ existed in the body of the fly, and that the head, feet,\r\nand wings, contained its antidote; for the same potent reason were the\r\nhairs of the rabid dog esteemed the true specific for Hydrophobia.[52]\r\n\r\n\r\n            DEVOTION TO AUTHORITY, AND ESTABLISHED ROUTINE.\r\n\r\nThis has always been the means of opposing the progress of reason—the\r\nadvancement of natural truths—and the prosecution of new discoveries;\r\nwhilst, with effects no less baneful, has it perpetuated many of the\r\nstupendous errors which have been already enumerated, as well as others\r\nno less weighty, and which are reserved for future discussion.\r\n\r\nTo give general currency to an hypothetical opinion, or medicinal\r\nreputation to an inert substance, requires only the talismanic aid of a\r\nfew great names; when once established upon such a basis, ingenuity,\r\nargument, and even experiment, may open their ineffectual batteries. The\r\nlaconic sentiment of the Roman Satirist is ever opposed to our\r\nremonstrance—“Marcus dixit?—ita est.”\r\n\r\n              “Did Marcus say ’twas fact? then fact it is,\r\n              No proof so valid as a word of his.”\r\n\r\nA physician cannot err, in the opinion of the public, if he implicitly\r\nobeys the dogmas of authority; in the most barbarous ages of ancient\r\nEgypt, he was punished or rewarded according to the extent of his\r\nsuccess, but to escape the former, it was only necessary to shew that an\r\northodox plan of cure had been followed, such as was prescribed in the\r\nacknowledged writings of Hermes. It is an instinct in our nature to\r\nfollow the track pointed out by a few leaders; we are gregarious\r\nanimals, in a moral as well as a physical sense, and we are addicted to\r\nroutine, because it is always easier to follow the opinions of others\r\nthan to reason and judge for ourselves. “The mass of mankind,” as Dr.\r\nPaley observes, “act more from habit than reflection.” What, but such a\r\ntemper could have upheld the preposterous system of Galen for more than\r\nthirteen centuries; and have enabled it to give universal laws in\r\nmedicine to Europe—Africa—and part of Asia?[53] What, but authority,\r\ncould have inspired a general belief, that the sooty washings of\r\nrosin[54] would act as an universal remedy? What, but a blind devotion\r\nto authority, or an insuperable attachment to established custom and\r\nroutine, could have so long preserved from oblivion the absurd medicines\r\nwhich abound in our earlier dispensatories? for example, the “_Decoctum\r\nad Ictericos_,” of the Edinburgh College, which never had any other\r\nfoundation than the doctrine of signatures, in favour of the _Curcuma_\r\nand _Chelidonium Majus_;[55] and it is only within a few years, that the\r\n_Theriaca Andromachi_, in its ancient absurd form, has been dismissed\r\nfrom the British Pharmocopœia.[56] The CODEX-MEDICAMENTARIUS of Paris,\r\nrecently edited, still cherishes this many-headed[57] monster of\r\npharmacy, in all its pristine deformity, under the appropriate title of\r\n“_Electuarium Opiatum Polupharmacum_.”\r\n\r\nIt is, however, evidently indebted for this unexpected rescue from\r\noblivion to a cause very remote from that which may be at first\r\nimagined; not from any belief in its powers or reliance upon its\r\nefficacy, but from a disinclination to oppose the torrent of popular\r\nprejudice, and to reject what has been established by authority and\r\nsanctioned by time. For the same reason, and in violation of their\r\nbetter judgment, the editors have retained the absurd formula of Diest\r\nfor the preparation of an extract of opium; which, after directing\r\nvarious successive operations, concludes by ordering the decoction to be\r\nboiled incessantly for six months, supplying the waste of water at\r\nintervals! Many of the compound formulæ in this new CODEX, it is frankly\r\nallowed, possess an unnecessary and unmeaning, if not an injurious\r\ncomplexity; and yet, such force has habit, and so paramount are the\r\n_verba magistri_, that the editors are satisfied in distinguishing the\r\nmore important ingredients by printing them in _Italics_, leaving the\r\nrest to be supplied at the whim and caprice of the dispenser, and thus\r\nare the grand objects and use of a national Pharmacopœia defeated, which\r\nshould above all things insure uniformity in the strength and\r\ncomposition of its officinal preparations.\r\n\r\nThe same devotion to authority which induces us to retain an accustomed\r\nremedy for pertinacity, will always oppose the introduction of a novel\r\npractice with asperity, unless indeed it be supported by authority of\r\nstill greater weight and consideration. The history of various articles\r\nof diet and medicine will prove in a striking manner, how greatly their\r\nreputation and fate have depended upon authority. It was not until many\r\nyears after _Ipecacuan_ had been imported into Europe, that Helvetius,\r\nunder the patronage of Louis XIV. succeeded in introducing it into\r\npractice: and to the eulogy of Katharine, queen of Charles II. we are\r\nindebted for the general introduction of Tea into England.[58]\r\n\r\nThat most extraordinary plant,[59] _Tobacco_, notwithstanding its powers\r\nof fascination, has suffered romantic vicissitudes in its fame and\r\ncharacter; it has been successively opposed, and commended by\r\nphysicians—condemned, and eulogised by priests and kings—and proscribed,\r\nand protected by governments; whilst at length this once insignificant\r\nproduction of a little island, or an obscure district, has succeeded in\r\ndiffusing itself through every climate, and in subjecting the\r\ninhabitants of every country to its dominion. The Arab cultivates it in\r\nthe burning desert—The Laplander and Esquimaux risk their lives to\r\nprocure a refreshment so delicious in their wintry solitude—the Seaman,\r\ngrant him but this luxury, and he will endure with cheerfulness every\r\nother privation, and defy the fury of the raging elements; and in the\r\nhigher walks of civilized society, at the shrine of fashion, in the\r\npalace, and in the cottage, the fascinating influence of this singular\r\nplant commands an equal tribute of devotion and attachment. The history\r\nof the Potatoe is perhaps not less extraordinary, and is strikingly\r\nillustrative of the omnipotent influence of authority; the introduction\r\nof this valuable plant received, for more than two centuries, an\r\nunexampled opposition from vulgar prejudice, which all the philosophy of\r\nthe age was unable to dissipate, until Louis the XVth wore a bunch of\r\nthe flowers of the potatoe in the midst of his court, on a day of\r\nfestivity; the people then for the first time obsequiously acknowledged\r\nits utility, and ventured to express their astonishment at the apathy\r\nwhich had so long prevailed with regard to its general cultivation; that\r\nwhich authority thus established, time and experience have fully\r\nratified, and scientific research has extended the numerous resources\r\nwhich this plant is so wonderfully calculated to furnish; thus, its\r\nstalk, considered as a textile plant, produces in Austria a cottony\r\nflax—in Sweden, sugar is extracted from its root—by combustion its\r\ndifferent parts yield a very considerable quantity of potass,—its\r\napples, when ripe, ferment and yield vinegar by exposure, or spirit by\r\ndistillation—its tubercles made into a pulp, are a substitute for soap\r\nin bleaching,—cooked by steam, the potatoe is the most wholesome and\r\nnutritious, and, at the same time, the most economical of all vegetable\r\naliments.[60]—by different manipulations it furnishes two kinds of\r\nflour, a gruel, and a parenchyma, which in times of scarcity may be made\r\ninto bread, or applied to increase the bulk of bread made from grain,—to\r\nthe invalid it furnishes both aliment and medicine; its starch is not in\r\nthe least inferior to the Indian arrow root, and Dr. Latham has lately\r\nshown that an extract may be prepared from its leaves and flowers, which\r\npossesses valuable properties as an anodyne remedy.[61]\r\n\r\nThe history of the warm bath[62] presents us with another curious\r\ninstance of the vicissitudes to which the reputation of our valuable\r\nresources are so universally exposed; that which for so many ages was\r\nesteemed the greatest luxury in health,[63] and the most efficacious\r\nremedy in disease, fell into total disrepute in the reign of Augustus,\r\nfor no other reason than because Antonius Musa had cured the Emperor of\r\na dangerous malady by the use of the _cold_ bath. The most frigid water\r\nthat could be procured was, in consequence, recommended on every\r\noccasion: thus Horace, in his epistle to Vala, exclaims—\r\n\r\n  “——Caput ac stomachum supponere fontibus audent.\r\n  Clusinis, gabiosque petunt, et frigida rura.”—_Epist._ xv. _Lib._ 1.\r\n\r\nThis practice, however, was doomed but to an ephemeral popularity, for\r\nalthough it had restored the Emperor to health, it shortly afterwards\r\nkilled his nephew and son in law, Marcellus; an event which at once\r\ndeprived the remedy of its credit, and the physician of his popularity.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Peruvian Bark would furnish a very curious\r\nillustration of the overbearing influence of authority in giving\r\ncelebrity to a medicine, or in depriving it of that reputation to which\r\nits virtues entitle it. This heroic remedy was first brought to Spain in\r\nthe year 1632, and we learn from Villerobel that it remained for seven\r\nyears in that country before any trial was made of its powers, a certain\r\necclesiastic of Alcala being the first person in Spain to whom it was\r\nadministered in the year 1639; but even at this period its use was\r\nlimited, and it would have sunk into oblivion but for the supreme power\r\nof the Roman church, by whose auspices it was enabled to gain a\r\ntemporary triumph over the passions and prejudices which opposed its\r\nintroduction; Innocent the Tenth, at the intercession of Cardinal de\r\nLugo, who was formerly a Spanish Jesuit, ordered that the nature and\r\neffects of it should be duly examined, and upon being reported as both\r\ninnocent and salutary, it immediately rose into public notice;[64] its\r\ncareer, however, was suddenly stopped by its having unfortunately failed\r\nin the autumn of 1652 to cure Leopold, Archduke of Austria, of a Quartan\r\nIntermittent; this disappointment kindled the resentment of the prince’s\r\nprincipal physician, Chifletius, who published a violent philippic\r\nagainst the virtues of Peruvian Bark, which so fomented the prejudices\r\nagainst its use, that it had nearly fallen into total neglect and\r\ndisrepute.\r\n\r\nThus there exists a fashion in medicine, as in the other affairs of\r\nlife, regulated by the caprice and supported by the authority of a few\r\nleading practitioners, which has been frequently the occasion of\r\ndismissing from practice valuable medicines, and of substituting others\r\nless certain in their effects and more questionable in their nature. As\r\nyears and fashions revolve, so have these neglected remedies, each in\r\nits turn, risen again into favour and notice, whilst old receipts, like\r\nold almanacks, are abandoned until the period may arrive, that will once\r\nmore adapt them to the spirit and fashion of the times. Thus it happens\r\nthat most of our “_New Discoveries_” in the Materia Medica have turned\r\nout to be no more than the revival and adaptation of ancient practices.\r\nIn the last century, the root of the _Aspidium Filix_, the Male Fern,\r\nwas retailed as a secret nostrum by Madame Nouffleur, a French empiric,\r\nfor the cure of tape worm; the secret was purchased for a considerable\r\nsum of money by Louis XV. and the physicians then discovered that the\r\nsame remedy had been administered in that complaint by Galen.[65]\r\n\r\nThe history of popular medicines for the cure of Gout, will also furnish\r\nus with ample matter for the illustration of this subject. The\r\ncelebrated Duke of Portland’s Powder was no other than the\r\n_Diacentaureon_ of Cælius Aurelianus, or the _Antidotos ex duobus\r\nCentaureæ generibus_ of Ætius,[66] the receipt for which a friend of his\r\nGrace brought from Switzerland; into which country it had been probably\r\nintroduced by the early medical writers, who had transcribed its virtues\r\nfrom the Greek volumes soon after their arrival into the western parts\r\nof Europe. The active ingredient of a no less celebrated remedy for the\r\nsame disease, _the Eau Medicinale_,[67] has been discovered to be the\r\n_Colchicum Autumnale_ or Meadow Saffron; upon investigating the\r\nproperties of this medicine, it was observed that similar effects in the\r\ncure of the gout were ascribed to a certain plant, called\r\n_Hermodactyllus_[68] by Oribasius and Ætius, but more particularly by\r\nAlexander of Tralles,[69] a physician of Asia Minor in the fourth\r\ncentury; an inquiry was accordingly instituted after this unknown plant,\r\nand upon procuring a specimen of it from Constantinople, it was actually\r\nfound to be a species of _Colchicum_.\r\n\r\nThe use of Prussic acid in the cure of Phthisis, which has been lately\r\nproposed by Dr. Majendie, and introduced into the _Codex\r\nMedicamentarius_ of Paris, is little else than the revival of the Dutch\r\npractice in this complaint; for Linnæus informs us, in the fourth volume\r\nof his “_Amænitates Academicæ_,” that distilled Laurel water was\r\nfrequently used in Holland for the cure of pulmonary consumption.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated fever powder of Dr. James was evidently not his original\r\ncomposition, but an Italian nostrum invented by a person of the name of\r\nLisle, a receipt for the preparation of which is to be found at length\r\nin _Colborne’s Complete English Dispensatory for the year 1756_.\r\n\r\nThe various secret preparations of Opium, which have been extolled as\r\nthe invention of modern times, may be recognized in the works of ancient\r\nauthors; for instance, Wedelius in his _Opiologia_ describes an acetic\r\nsolution; and the _Magisterium_ of Ludovicus, as noticed by Etmuller,\r\nwas a preparation made by dissolving Opium in vinegar, and precipitating\r\nwith Salt of Tartar;[70] Van Helmont recommends a preparation, similar\r\nto the black drop, under the title of _Laudanum Cydoniatum:_ then again\r\nwe have Langelott’s Laudanum, and Le Mort’s “_Extract out of Rain\r\nwater_,” preparations which owe their mildness to the abstraction of the\r\nresinous element of opium.\r\n\r\nThe works of Glauber contain accounts of many discoveries that have been\r\nclaimed by the chemists of our own day; he recommends the use of\r\nmuriatic acid in sea scurvy, and describes an apparatus for its\r\npreparation exactly similar to that which has been extolled as the\r\ninvention of Wolff; he also notices the production of _Pyro-acetic\r\nAcid_, under the title of “_Vinegar of Wood_,” so that the fact of the\r\nidentity of this acid and Vinegar, so lately announced by Vauquelin as a\r\n_New Discovery_, was evidently known to Glauber nearly two centuries\r\nago.\r\n\r\nWe have within the last few years heard much of the efficacy of Henbane\r\nfumigations in the tooth-ache, an application which may be easily shewn\r\nto be the revival only of a very ancient practice.[71]\r\n\r\nBut while we might thus proceed to annul many other claims for\r\noriginality, we ought not to close our eyes to the fallacies to which\r\nsuch investigations are peculiarly exposed. Nothing is more easy than to\r\ninvest the doubtful sentence of an obscure author with an interpretation\r\nbest adapted for the support of a favourite theory, and instances might\r\nbe adduced where the medical antiquarian[72] has by violence and\r\ndistortion forced the most contradictory passages into his service;\r\ntreating, in short, the oracles of Physic just as Lord Peter treated his\r\nfather’s will in the _Tale of a Tub_,—determined to discover the word\r\n“_Shoulder Knots_,” he picks it out, letter by letter, and is even at\r\nlast obliged to substitute C for K in the orthography.\r\n\r\nNor has Fashion confined her baneful interference to the selection of\r\nremedies; she has ventured even to decide upon the nature of Diseases,\r\nand to change and modify their appellations according to the whim and\r\ncaprice by which she is governed. The Princess, afterwards Queen Anne,\r\nwas subject to Hypochondriacal attacks, which her Physicians pronounced\r\nto be _Spleen_, _Vapours_, or _Hyp_, and recommended Rawleigh’s\r\nConfection, and Pearl Cordial, for its cure: this circumstance was\r\nsufficient to render both the Disease and Remedy _fashionable_; no other\r\ncomplaint was ever heard of in the precincts of the court but that of\r\nthe _Vapours_, nor any medicine esteemed but that of Rawleigh. Some\r\nyears afterwards, in consequence of Dr. Whytt’s publication on “_Nervous\r\ndiseases_,” a lady of Fashion was pronounced to be _Nervous_—the term\r\nbecame general, and the disease _fashionable_; and _Spleen_, _Vapours_,\r\nand _Hyp_ were consigned to oblivion: the reign of Nervous Diseases,\r\nhowever, did not long continue, for a popular work appeared on Biliary\r\nConcretions, and all the world became _bilious_. We have not patience to\r\npursue the history of these follies; a transient glance at the ephemeral\r\nproductions of the last twenty years would furnish a sad display of the\r\nversatility of medical opinions, and of the instability of the practice\r\nwhich has been founded upon them: and they will no doubt furnish the\r\nfuture historian with strong and forcible illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSIGNING TO ART THAT WHICH WAS THE EFFECT OF UNASSISTED NATURE, OR\r\n       THE CONSEQUENCE OF INCIDENTAL CHANGES OF HABIT, DIET, &c.\r\n\r\nOur inability upon all occasions to appreciate the efforts of nature in\r\nthe cure of disease, must always render our notions, with respect to the\r\npowers of art, liable to numerous errors and multiplied deceptions.\r\nNothing is more natural, and at the same time more erroneous, than to\r\nattribute the cure of a disease to the last medicine that had been\r\nemployed; the advocates of amulets and charms[73] have even been thus\r\nenabled to appeal to the testimony of what they call experience, in\r\njustification of their superstitions; and cases which, in truth and\r\njustice, ought to be considered most lucky escapes, have been\r\ntriumphantly pronounced as skilful cures; and thus have medicines and\r\npractitioners alike acquired unmerited praise, or unjust censure. Upon\r\nMrs. Stephens offering her remedy for the stone to Parliament,[74] a\r\ncommittee of professional men was nominated to ascertain its efficacy; a\r\npatient with stone was selected, and he took the remedy; his sufferings\r\nwere soon relieved, and upon examining the bladder in the usual way, no\r\nstone could be felt, it was therefore agreed that the patient had been\r\ncured, and that the stone had been dissolved; some time afterwards this\r\npatient died, and on being opened, a large stone was found in a pouch,\r\nformed by a part of the bladder, and which communicated with it. When\r\nthe yellow fever raged in America, the practitioners trusted exclusively\r\nto the copious use of mercury; at first, this plan was deemed so\r\nuniversally efficacious, that in the enthusiasm of the moment, it was\r\ntriumphantly proclaimed that death never took place after the mercury\r\nhad evinced its effect upon the system: all this was very true, but it\r\nfurnished no proof of the efficacy of that metal, since the disease, in\r\nits aggravated form, was so rapid in its career, that it swept away its\r\nvictims long before the system could be brought under mercurial\r\ninfluence, while in its milder shape it passed off equally well without\r\nany assistance from art.\r\n\r\nLet us then, before we decree the honours of a cure to a favourite\r\nmedicine, carefully and candidly ascertain the exact circumstances under\r\nwhich it was exhibited, or we shall rapidly accumulate examples of the\r\nfallacies to which our art is exposed; what has been more common than to\r\nattribute to the efficacy of a mineral water, those fortunate changes of\r\nconstitution that have entirely or in great measure, arisen from\r\nsalubrity of situation, hilarity of mind, exercise of body, and\r\nregularity of habits, which have incidentally accompanied its potation.\r\nThus, the celebrated John Wesley, while he commemorates the triumph of\r\n‘Sulphur and Supplication’ over his bodily infirmity, forgets to\r\nappreciate the resuscitating influence of four months repose from his\r\napostolic labours; and such is the disposition of the human mind to\r\nplace confidence in the operation of mysterious agents, that we find him\r\nmore disposed to attribute his cure to a brown paper plaister of egg and\r\nbrimstone, than to Dr. Fothergill’s salutary prescription of country\r\nair, rest, asses milk, and horse exercise.[75] The ancient physicians\r\nduly appreciated the influence of such agents; their temples, like our\r\nwatering places, were the resort of those whom medicine could not cure,\r\nand we are expressly told by Plutarch that these temples, especially\r\nthat of Esculapius, were erected on elevated spots, with the most\r\ncongenial aspects; a circumstance which, when aided by the invigorating\r\neffects of hope, by the diversions which the patient experienced in his\r\njourney, and perhaps by the exercise to which he had been unaccustomed,\r\ncertainly performed many cures. It follows then that in the\r\nrecommendation of a _watering place_, something more than the\r\ncomposition of a mineral spring is to direct our choice,—the chemist\r\nwill tell us, that the springs of Hampstead and Islington rival those of\r\nTunbridge and Malvern, that the waters of Bagnigge Wells, as a\r\nchalybeate purgative, might supersede those of Cheltenham and\r\nScarborough, and that an invalid would frequent the spring in the\r\nvicinity of the Dog and Duck, in St. George’s Fields, with as much\r\nadvantage as the celebrated Spa at Leamington; but the physician is well\r\naware that by the adoption of such advice, he would deprive his patient\r\nof those most powerful auxiliaries to which I have alluded, and above\r\nall, lose the advantages of the “_Medicina Mentis_.” On the other hand,\r\nthe recommendation of change of air and habits will rarely inspire\r\nconfidence, unless it be associated with some medicinal treatment; a\r\ntruth which it is more easy and satisfactory to elucidate and enforce by\r\nexamples than by precept—let the following story by Voltaire serve as an\r\nillustration.—“Ogul, a voluptuary who could be managed but with\r\ndifficulty by his physician, on finding himself extremely ill from\r\nindolence and intemperance, requested advice:—‘Eat a Basilisk, stewed in\r\nrose-water,’ replied the physician. In vain did the slaves search for a\r\n_Basilisk_, until they met with Zadig, who, approaching Ogul, exclaimed,\r\n‘Behold that which thou desirest;’ ‘but, my Lord,’ continued he, ‘it is\r\nnot to be eaten; all its virtues must enter through thy pores, I have\r\ntherefore enclosed it in a little ball, blown up, and covered with a\r\nfine skin; thou must strike this ball with all thy might, and I must\r\nstrike it back again, for a considerable time, and by observing this\r\nregimen, and taking no other drink than rose-water for a few days, thou\r\nwilt see, and acknowledge the effect of my art.’ The first day Ogul was\r\nout of breath, and thought he should have died from fatigue; the second\r\nhe was less fatigued, and slept better: in eight days he recovered all\r\nhis strength; Zadig then said to him, ‘There is no such thing in nature\r\nas a Basilisk! but _thou hast taken exercise and been temperate, and\r\nhast therefore recovered thy health_!’ But the medical practitioner may\r\nperhaps receive more satisfaction from a modern illustration; if so, the\r\nfollowing anecdote, related by Sydenham, may not be unacceptable. This\r\ngreat physician having long attended a gentleman of fortune with little\r\nor no advantage, frankly avowed his inability to render him any farther\r\nservice, adding at the same time, that there was a physician of the name\r\nof Robinson, at Inverness, who had distinguished himself by the\r\nperformance of many remarkable cures of the same complaint as that under\r\nwhich his patient laboured, and expressing a conviction that, if he\r\napplied to him, he would come back cured. This was too encouraging a\r\nproposal to be rejected; the gentleman received from Sydenham a\r\nstatement of his case, with the necessary letter of introduction, and\r\nproceeded without delay to the place in question. On arriving at\r\nInverness, and anxiously enquiring for the residence of Dr. Robinson, he\r\nfound to his utter dismay and disappointment, that there was no\r\nphysician of that name, nor ever had been in the memory of any person\r\nthere. The gentleman returned, vowing eternal hostility to the peace of\r\nSydenham; and on his arrival at home, instantly expressed his\r\nindignation at having been sent on a journey of so many hundred miles\r\nfor no purpose. “Well,” replies Sydenham, “are you better in\r\nhealth?”—“Yes, I am now quite well, but no thanks to you,”—“No,” says\r\nSydenham, “but you may thank Dr. Robinson for curing you. I wished to\r\nsend you a journey with some object of interest in view; I knew it would\r\nbe of service to you; in going you had Dr. Robinson and his wonderful\r\ncures in contemplation; and in returning, you were equally engaged in\r\nthinking of scolding me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AMBIGUITY OF NOMENCLATURE.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated that we are to a great degree ignorant of the\r\nSimples used by the ancient Physicians; we are often quite unable to\r\ndetermine what the plants are of which Dioscorides treats. It does not\r\nappear that out of the 700 plants of which his Materia Medica consists,\r\nthat more than 400 are correctly ascertained; and yet no labour has been\r\nspared to clear the subject of its difficulties; Cullen even laments\r\nthat so much pains should have been bestowed upon so barren an\r\noccasion.[76] The early history of botany presents us with such a chaos\r\nof nomenclature, that it must have been impossible for the herbarist and\r\nphysician to have communicated their mutual lights; every one was\r\noccupied with disputes upon words and names, and every useful inquiry\r\nwas suspended, from an inability to decide what plant each author\r\nintended; thus, for instance, the _Herba Britannica_ of Dioscorides and\r\nPliny, so celebrated for the cure of the soldiers of Julius Cæsar on the\r\nRhine, of a disease called ‘_Scelotyrbe_’, and supposed to resemble our\r\nsea scurvy, remains quite unknown, notwithstanding the labours of our\r\nmost intelligent commentators.[77] It seems also very doubtful whether\r\nthe plant which we denominate _Hemlock_ was the poison usually\r\nadministered at the Athenian executions,[78] and which deprived Socrates\r\nand Phocion of life. Pliny informs us that the word _Cicuta_, amongst\r\nthe ancients, was not indicative of any particular species of plant, but\r\nof vegetable poisons in general; this is a circumstance to which I am\r\nparticularly anxious to fix your attention; it is by no means uncommon\r\nto find a word which is used to express general characters, subsequently\r\nbecome the name of a specific substance in which such characters are\r\npredominant; and we shall find that some important anomalies in\r\nnomenclature may be thus explained. The term ‘Αρσενικον,’ from which the\r\nword _Arsenic_ is derived, was an ancient epithet, applied to those\r\nnatural substances which possessed strong and acrimonious properties,\r\nand as the poisonous quality of arsenic was found to be remarkably\r\npowerful, the term was especially applied to Orpiment, the form in which\r\nthis metal more usually occurred. So the term _Verbena_ (quasi _Hebena_)\r\noriginally denoted _all those_ herbs that were held sacred on account of\r\ntheir being employed in the rites of sacrifice, as we learn from the\r\npoets;[79] but as _one_ herb was usually adopted upon these occasions,\r\nthe word _Verbena_ came to denote that particular herb _only_, and it is\r\ntransmitted to us to this day under the same title, viz. _Verbena_, or\r\n_Vervain_, and indeed until lately it enjoyed the medical reputation\r\nwhich its sacred origin conferred upon it, for it was worn suspended\r\naround the neck as an amulet. _Vitriol_, in the original application of\r\nthe word, denoted _any_ crystalline body with a certain degree of\r\ntransparency (_Vitrum_); it is hardly necessary to observe that the term\r\nis now appropriated to a particular species: in the same manner, _Bark_,\r\nwhich is a general term, is applied to express _one_ genus, and by way\r\nof eminence, it has the article, _The_, prefixed, as _The_ Bark: the\r\nsame observation will apply to the word _Opium_, which in its primitive\r\nsense signifies _any_ juice (οπος _Succus_) while it now only denotes\r\n_one_ species, viz. that of the Poppy. So again, _Elaterium_ was used by\r\nHippocrates, to signify various internal applications, especially\r\npurgatives of a violent and drastic nature (from the word ‘Ελαυνω,’\r\n_agito_, _moveo_, _stimulo_), but by succeeding authors it was\r\n_exclusively_ applied to denote the active matter which subsides from\r\nthe juice of the _wild cucumber_. The word _Fecula_, again, originally\r\nmeant to imply _any_ substance which was derived by spontaneous\r\nsubsidence from a liquid, (from _fæx_, the grounds or settlement of\r\n_any_ liquor); afterwards it was applied to _Starch_, which is deposited\r\nin this manner by agitating the flour of wheat in water; and lastly, it\r\nhas been applied to a peculiar vegetable principle, which like\r\n_starch_[80] is insoluble in cold, but completely soluble in boiling\r\nwater, with which it forms a gelatinous solution; this indefinite\r\nmeaning of the word _fecula_ has created numerous mistakes in\r\npharmaceutic chemistry; Elaterium, for instance, is said to be a\r\n_fecula_, and in the original sense of the word it is properly so\r\ncalled, inasmuch as it is procured from a vegetable juice by spontaneous\r\nsubsidence, but in the limited and modern acceptation of the term, it\r\nconveys an erroneous idea; for instead of the active principle of the\r\njuice residing in _fecula_, it is a peculiar proximate principle, _sui\r\ngeneris_, to which I have ventured to bestow the name of _Elatin_. For\r\nthe same reason, much doubt and obscurity involve the meaning of the\r\nword _Extract_, because it is applied _generally_ to any substance\r\nobtained by the evaporation of a vegetable solution, and _specifically_\r\nto a peculiar proximate principle, possessed of certain characters, by\r\nwhich it is distinguished from every other elementary body—See\r\n_Extracta_. On the other hand, we find that many words which were\r\noriginally only used to denote particular substances, have, at length,\r\nbecome subservient to the expression of General Characters; thus the\r\nterm _Alkali_, in its originally sense, signified that particular\r\nresiduum which was alone obtained by lixiviating the ashes of the plant\r\nnamed _Kali_, but the word is now so generalized that it denotes _any_\r\nbody possessed of a certain number of definite properties.\r\n\r\nAnother source of botanical ambiguity and error is the circumstance of\r\ncertain plants having acquired the names of others very different in\r\ntheir nature, but which were supposed to possess a similarity in\r\nexternal character; thus our POTATOE,[81] (_Solanum Tuberosum_) when it\r\nwas first imported into England by the colonists in the reign of Queen\r\nElizabeth, gained its appellation from its supposed resemblance to an\r\nesculent vegetable at that time in common use, under the name of the\r\nSweet Potatoe (_Convolvulus Battatas_,) and which, like _Eringo Root_,\r\nhad the reputation of being able to restore decayed vigour, thus\r\nFalstaff—\r\n\r\n “Let the sky rain Potatoes, hail kissing Comfits, and snow Eringoes.”\r\n                                       _Merry Wives of Windsor, Act 5,\r\n                                          Scene 5._\r\n\r\nA similar instance is presented to us in the culinary vegetable well\r\nknown under the name of the JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE, which derived its\r\nappellation in consequence of its flavour having been considered like\r\nthat of the common artichoke; it is hardly necessary to observe that it\r\nhas no botanic relation whatever to such a plant, it being an Heliotrope\r\n(_Heliotropium Tuberosum_), the epithet _Jerusalem_ is a curious\r\ncorruption of the Italian term _Gira-Sole_, that is, _turn-sun_, in\r\nEnglish, or _Heliotrope_ in Greek. This instance of verbal corruption is\r\nnot solitary in medical botany; CASTOR OIL will suggest itself as\r\nanother example; this oil, from its supposed efficacy in curing and\r\nassuaging the unnatural heat of the body, and in soothing the passions,\r\nwas called by the French _Agnus Castus_, whence the inhabitants of St.\r\nKitt’s in the West Indies, who were formerly blended with the French in\r\nthat Island, called it _Castor_ oil. In some cases again, a plant has\r\nreceived a modern name, compounded of two ancient ones; it appears from\r\nPliny that the _Assarum_ was not uncommonly confounded with the\r\n_Baccharis_; an English name was accordingly bestowed upon it, which is\r\na curious compromise of the question, for it is a compound of both, viz.\r\n_Assara-bacca_.\r\n\r\nIn some instances the most alarming mistakes have occurred from\r\nsubstances of a very different nature having been mentioned under\r\nsimilar names, _Arsenic_ for instance, has actually been inhaled,[82]\r\ntogether with the vapours of Frankincense, Myrrh, and those of other\r\ngums, during a paroxysm of Asthma! a practice which arose from the\r\npractitioner having confounded the Gum Juniper, or _Vernix_ of the\r\nArabians, which was prescribed for fumigations under the name of\r\n_Sandarach_, with the Σανδαρακη of Aristotle, and which was a sulpheret\r\nof Arsenic. The gum which we know at the present day under the name of\r\n_Sanguis Draconis_, or _Dragon’s blood_, was called by the ancient\r\nGreeks Κινναβαρὶ, a term which has been incorrectly transferred to a\r\nSulphuret of Mercury, for no other reason than because this mineral has\r\nthe same red colour as the gum.\r\n\r\nThe advanced state of BOTANICAL SCIENCE will now prevent the recurrence\r\nof those doubts and difficulties which have formerly embarrassed the\r\nhistory of vegetable remedies, by furnishing a strictly philosophical\r\nlanguage, independent of all theory, and founded upon natural structure,\r\nand therefore necessarily beyond the controul of opinion; while the\r\nadvancement of chemical knowledge, by enabling us better to distinguish\r\nand identify the different substances we employ, will also materially\r\nassist in preventing the confusion which has formerly oppressed us. At\r\nthe same time, I am unwilling to join in the commendations so liberally\r\nbestowed upon our chemical nomenclature; nay, I am disposed to consider\r\nit as a matter of regret that the names of our medicinal compounds\r\nshould have any relation to their chemical composition, for in the\r\npresent unsettled state of this science, such a language must\r\nnecessarily convey theory instead of truth, and opinions rather than\r\nfacts; in short, it places us at the mercy and disposal of every new\r\nhypothesis, which may lay our boasted fabric in ruins, and in its place\r\nraise another superstructure, equally frail in its materials and\r\nephemeral in its duration: thus CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE was a _muriate_ of\r\nMercury, or an _oxy-muriate_, until Sir H. Davy established his new\r\ntheory of chlorine, and then it became a _bi-chloride_; at some future\r\nperiod, Chlorine will be found to be a compound, and then it must have\r\nanother name; for the same reason the term CALOMEL,[83] is surely to be\r\npreferred to _sub-muriate_, or _Chloride_. TARTARIZED ANTIMONY, again,\r\nhas been called by our nomenclatural reformers the _Tartrate of Antimony\r\nand Potass_; but is it a triple compound? Gay Lussac thinks not, and\r\nconsiders it as a combination, in which _Cream of Tartar_ acts the part\r\nof a simple acid.\r\n\r\nAgain,—we have only to revert to the nomenclature of the Salts in our\r\nMateria Medica to discover the actual change in meaning which the same\r\nword has undergone in a very few years. It was originally understood\r\nthat the term _Sub_, when prefixed to the generic name of a Salt,\r\nindicated the presence of certain qualities depending upon an excess of\r\nbase; but now, forsooth, the term has reference only to atomic\r\ncomposition, without any regard to qualities.[84] That salt alone being\r\nacknowledged as a true _Sub_-salt, in which there is less than one atom\r\nof acid to each atom of base; thus our “_Sub_-carbonate of Soda,” is no\r\nlonger considered a _Sub_-salt, for the reason above stated; and\r\nnotwithstanding the predominance of its alkaline characters, it is known\r\nto chemists by the appellation of _Carbonate_ of soda. It is far from my\r\nintention to question the propriety of these changes, I only maintain\r\nthat, amidst such chemical doubts, the Pharmaceutist is the last person\r\nwho should become arbiter; let him await the issue in unobtrusive\r\nsilence, and take care that the language of Pharmacy partakes of the\r\nsame neutrality.\r\n\r\nSuch was the feeling of the Committee appointed by the College for the\r\nrevision of the late London Pharmacopœia, and it sufficiently explains\r\nwhy the nomenclature of the alkaline salts has been left unchanged in\r\nthe present edition of that work.\r\n\r\nThe French, in their new _Codex_, are absurdly extravagant in their\r\napplication of chemical nomenclature; thus, the sub-carbonate of potass\r\nis called by them _sub-deuto-carbonas potassii_. The first part of this\r\nquadruple name indicates the comparative quantity of acid in the salt,\r\nthe second that of oxygen contained in the base, the thud announces the\r\nacid, and the fourth the basis of the base!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE PROGRESS OF BOTANICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nIt has been just stated, that we have derived from botanical science a\r\nphilosophical language which enables us to describe the structure and\r\nhabits of any plant, with a luminous brevity and an unerring\r\nperspicuity; but we are moreover indebted to botany for another service\r\nno less important to the successful investigation of the Materia\r\nMedica,—that of throwing into well defined groups, those plants which\r\npossess obvious natural affinities, and which will be found at the same\r\ntime to present certain medicinal analogies; indeed, as a general rule,\r\nwe may admit the axiom, “_Quæ genere conveniunt, virtute\r\nconveniunt_.”[85]\r\n\r\nThe _Umbelliferæ_ which grow on dry ground are aromatic, whilst the\r\naquatic species are among the most deadly poisons. The _Cruciform_\r\nplants are aromatic and acrid in their nature, containing essential\r\noils, (hence the peculiar smell of cabbage-water, &c.) which are\r\nobtainable by distillation; and Linnæus asserts that “among all the\r\n_Leguminous_ or _Papilionaceous_ tribe there is no deleterious plant to\r\nbe found:” this however is not exactly true. Some of the individuals in\r\nthese natural orders, although very nearly related, do nevertheless\r\npossess various, and even opposite qualities; in the leguminous tribe\r\nabove mentioned, which is as consistent as any one we possess, we have\r\nthe _Cytisus Laburnum_, the seeds of which are violently emetic, and\r\nthose of _Lathyrus Sativus_, which have been supposed at Florence to\r\nsoften the bones and cause death.\r\n\r\nIn the subdivision of a genus there is often a remarkable difference in\r\nthe properties of the species; there are, for instance, _Solanums_,\r\n_Lettuces_, _Cucumbers_, and _Mushrooms_, both esculent and poisonous.\r\nThe _Digitalis_ or _Foxglove_, and the _Verbascum_, or common _Mullein_\r\nof our fields, are included in the same Natural family, and yet the one\r\nis as active, as the other is mild in its effects; the plants of the\r\nnatural family of _Contortæ_ abound with a highly acrid milky juice, but\r\nDr. Afzelius met with a shrub of this order at Sierra Leone, the milk of\r\nwhose fruit was so sweet, as well as copious, as to be used instead of\r\ncream for tea; this is certainly what no one could have guessed from\r\nanalogy. The same individual will vary from culture or other\r\ncircumstances, as much as any two plants which have no botanic affinity;\r\nthe Chamomile, _Anthemis Nobilis_, with which we are well acquainted,\r\nmay have its whole disk changed by cultivation, to ligulate white\r\nflorets, destitute of medicinal properties. But, what is more\r\nembarrassing, the different parts of the same plant have often very\r\ndifferent powers; a fact which is beautifully exemplified in the\r\n_Podophyllum Peltatum_, or May Apple, the _leaves_ of which are\r\npoisonous, the root powerfully cathartic, and the _fruit_ agreeably\r\nesculent; so the leaves of the _Jatropa Manihot_ are employed as a\r\ncommon esculent, while its root secretes a most virulent poison; but we\r\nneed not seek further for an example than the fruit of the Lemon, the\r\njuice of which is _acid_, its seeds _bitter_, and its _rind aromatic_;\r\nin some instances it happens that the energy of a plant is concentrated\r\nin one particular part, and that all the rest is absolutely inert; thus,\r\nthe root of the _Convolvulus Scammonia_, is the only portion of that\r\nplant which possesses any medicinal quality;[86] and the tree which\r\nyields the drastic _Camboge_, presents at the same time an esculent\r\nfruit, which is eaten by the natives with as much impunity as the\r\norange; yet, notwithstanding all these difficulties, botany is capable\r\nof furnishing us with analogies which will lead to important conclusions\r\nwith respect to the medicinal properties of different vegetables.\r\n\r\nThe system of Linnæus, although in a great degree artificial,\r\ncorresponds in a surprising manner with the natural properties of\r\nplants; thus a plant whose _calyx_ is a double valved _glume_, with\r\nthree _stamina_, two _pistils_, and one _naked seed_, bears seeds of a\r\nfarinaceous and nutritious quality; a flower with twelve, or more\r\n_stamina_, all of which are inserted in the internal side of the\r\n_calyx_, will furnish a wholesome fruit; whereas a plant whose flower\r\nhas five _stamina_, one _pistil_, one _petal_, and whose fruit is of the\r\n_berry_ kind, may at once be pronounced as poisonous.\r\n\r\nIt is also in a great degree true that the sensible qualities of plants,\r\nsuch as _colour_, _taste_, and _smell_, have an intimate relation to\r\ntheir properties, and may often lead by analogy to an indication of\r\ntheir powers; we have an example of this in the dark and gloomy aspect\r\nof the _Luridæ_, which is indicative of their narcotic and very\r\ndangerous qualities, as _Datura_, _Hyoscyamus_, _Atropa_, and\r\n_Nicotiana_. _Colour_ is certainly in many cases a test of activity; the\r\ndeepest coloured flowers of the _Digitalis_, for example, are the most\r\nactive, and when the leaves of powerful plants lose their green hue, we\r\nmay conclude that a corresponding deterioration has taken place with\r\nrespect to their virtues; but Linnæus ascribed too much importance to\r\nsuch an indication, and his aphorisms are unsupported by facts; for\r\ninstance, he says “Color pallidus _insipidum_, viridis _crudum_, luteus\r\n_amarum_, ruber _acidum_, albus _dulce_, niger _ingratum_, indicat.”[87]\r\nA peculiar heavy odour, which is well known, but is with difficulty\r\ndefined, is a sure indication of narcotic properties. Bitterness, when\r\nnot extreme, denotes a tonic quality, which will stimulate the stomach\r\nand intestines, and promote the process of digestion. When the\r\nbitterness is more intense and pungent,[88] as in _Aloes_, _Colocynth_,\r\n_&c._ we may infer that such substances will produce a more active\r\neffect upon the _primæ viæ_, and that catharsis will follow their\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nBotanical, like human physiognomy, may frequently afford an insight into\r\ncharacter, but it is very often a fallacious index. With regard to the\r\nindications of _Smell_ and _Taste_, it may be observed that in the\r\nexamination of an unknown substance we instinctively apply to these\r\nsenses for information respecting its properties. It is certainly\r\nreasonable to suppose, that those bodies which produce upon the organs\r\nof taste a sensible, astringent, or pungent effect, may occasion an\r\nimpression, corresponding in degree upon the stomach or intestines,\r\nwhich are but an extension of the same structure. But what numerous\r\nexceptions are there to such a law? nay, some of the most poisonous\r\nsubstances affect in a very slight degree the organs of taste,\r\nespecially those that belong to the mineral kingdom, as _Arsenious\r\nAcid_, _Oxyd of Antimony_, _Calomel_, _&c._; yet some of these are,\r\nperhaps, but apparent exceptions, depending upon the degree of\r\nsolubility which they possess, in consequence of which their energies\r\nare not developed until they have traversed a considerable portion of\r\nmucous surface. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that cultivation and\r\nartificial habits may have blunted the natural susceptibility of our\r\norgans, and in some instances changed and depraved their functions:\r\ncertain qualities for instance are so strongly connected with each other\r\nby the chain of association, that by presenting only one to the mind,\r\nthe other links follow in succession.[89] It has been remarked, that\r\npersons in social life, are more affected by vegetable odours, while the\r\nSavage smells better the putrid and fœtid exhalations of animal\r\nbodies:[90] thus the people of Kamskatcha, did not smell the perfume of\r\na vegetable Essence (_Aqua Melissæ_,) but they discovered by their\r\nolfactory sense, a rotten fish, or a stranded whale at a considerable\r\ndistance.[91] There is no sense more under the dominion of imagination,\r\nor more liable to be perverted by education, than those of taste and\r\nsmell; we are also liable to form unjust prejudices from the indications\r\nof colour; for particular colours, from the influence of hidden\r\nassociations, are not unfrequently the exciting cause of agreeable or\r\nunpleasant impressions. I have met with a person who regards green food,\r\nif it be of an animal nature, with unconquerable aversion and disgust,\r\nindeed an idea of unwholesomeness has not unfrequently been attached to\r\nthis colour, without the least foundation of truth; the bones of the Gar\r\nfish, or Sea Needle, (_Esox Helone_,) have been deemed unwholesome from\r\nthe circumstance of their turning green on being boiled, although not a\r\nsingle instance can be adduced in which that fish ever occasioned any\r\nharm. I have met with persons who have been made violently sick from\r\neating the green part of the oyster;[92] an effect which can have no\r\nother cause than that of unjust prejudice; these examples are sufficient\r\nto shew, with what caution such indications respecting the medicinal\r\nqualities of bodies are to be received.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE APPLICATION AND MISAPPLICATION OF CHEMICAL SCIENCE.\r\n\r\nAmongst the researches of different authors, who, animated with a sacred\r\nzeal for ancient learning, have endeavoured to establish the antiquity\r\nof chemical science, we find many conclusions deduced from an ingenious\r\ninterpretation of the mythological fables[93] which are supposed to have\r\nbeen transmitted by the Egyptians; who, previous to the invention of\r\nletters, adopted this method of perpetuating their discoveries in\r\nnatural philosophy. Thus, wherever Homer studiously describes the stolen\r\nembraces of Mars and Venus, they recognise some chemical secret, some\r\ncombination of iron with copper, shadowed in the glowing ornaments of\r\nfiction. Lord Bacon[94] conceived that the union of spirit and matter\r\nwas allegorised in the fable of Proserpine being seized by Pluto as she\r\nwas gathering flowers; an allusion, says Dr. Darwin, which is rendered\r\nmore curiously exact by the late discovery, that pure air, (_oxygen_) is\r\ngiven out by vegetables, and that in this state it is greedily absorbed\r\nby inflammable bodies. The same ingenious Poet supposes that the fable\r\nof Jupiter and Juno, by whose union the vernal showers were said to be\r\nproduced, was meant to pourtray the production of water by the\r\ncombination of its two elements; an opinion which, says he, is strongly\r\nsupported by the fact that, in the ancient mythology, the purer air or\r\n_æther_, was always represented by Jupiter, and the inferior by Juno.\r\nWere the elegant author of the Botanic Garden now living, he would, no\r\ndoubt, with a taste and delicacy peculiarly his own, avail himself of\r\nthe singular discovery of Mr. Smithson, who has detected in the juice of\r\nthe mulberry _two_ distinct species of colouring matter;—the mingled\r\nblood of the unfortunate Pyramus and Thisbe:\r\n\r\n “Signa tene cædis: pullosque et luctibus aptos\r\n Semper habe feætus, _gemina_ monumenta cruoris.”\r\n                                        _Ovid. Metamorph. Lib._ iv. 160.\r\n\r\nSir William Drummond, the learned apologist of Egyptian science,\r\nconceives that the laws of _latent_ heat were even known to the\r\nphilosophers of that ancient nation, and that caloric in such a state,\r\nwas symbolically represented by VULCAN, while _free_ or _sensible_\r\ncaloric was as clearly described in the character of VESTA. Those who\r\nmaintain the antiquity of chemistry, and suppose that the fabulous\r\nconceptions of the ancients were but a mysterious veil ingeniously\r\nthrown by philosophy between nature and the lower order of people,\r\nconsider that the alchemical secret is metaphorically concealed in the\r\nfable of the GOLDEN FLEECE of the Argonauts, and reject the more\r\nprobable solution of this story by Strabo, who says that the Iberians,\r\nnear neighbours of the Colchians, used to receive the gold, brought down\r\nfrom the high lands by the torrents, into sieves and sheep skins, and\r\nthat from thence arose the fable of the golden fleece. Dionysius, of\r\nMytilene, offers a different explanation of the fable, and supposes it\r\nto allude to a book _written on skins_, and containing an account of the\r\nprocess of _making gold_ according to the art of alchemy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the confidence with which modern philosophers have\r\nclaimed the discovery, the experimental mode of investigation was\r\nundoubtedly known and pursued by the ancients, who appear, says _Mr.\r\nLeslie_,[95] to have concealed their notions respecting it, under the\r\nveil of allegory. _Proteus_ signified the mutable and changing forms of\r\nmaterial objects, and the inquisitive philosopher was counselled by the\r\nPoets[96] to watch their slippery demon when slumbering on the shore, to\r\nbind him, and compel the reluctant captive to reveal his secrets. This,\r\nadds Mr. Leslie, gives a lively picture of the cautious, but intrepid\r\nadvances of the skilful experimenter;—he tries to press nature into a\r\ncorner,—he endeavours to separate the different principles of action,—he\r\nseeks to concentrate the predominant agent, and labours to exclude, as\r\nmuch as possible, every disturbing influence.\r\n\r\nBut with whatever ingenuity and success the antiquity of chemical\r\nknowledge may be advocated, as it relates to the various arts of life,\r\nyet it must be allowed that not the most remote trace of its application\r\nto physic can be discovered in the medical writers of Greece or Rome.\r\nThe operation of distillation[97] is not even mentioned by Hippocrates\r\nor Galen; and the waters of different plants, as described by some later\r\nauthors, are to be understood, as we are informed by Gesner, merely as\r\nsimple decoctions, and not as the products of any chemical process;\r\nwhile the Essences of Dioscorides, Galen, Oribasius, and others, were\r\nonly the extracts produced by the evaporation of such infusions.\r\n\r\nUpon the downfall of the Roman Empire, all the sciences, the arts, and\r\nliterature, were overwhelmed in the general wreck, and the early\r\nMahometans, in the first paroxysms of their fanaticism, endeavoured to\r\ndestroy every record of the former progress of the human mind;\r\nconsigning to destruction, by the conflagration of the Alexandrian\r\nlibrary, no less than seven hundred thousand volumes, which comprised\r\nthe most valuable works of science and literature.[98] It is not a\r\nlittle extraordinary that this same people were destined at a more\r\nadvanced period, to rekindle the light of letters,[99] which they had\r\ntaken such pains to extinguish, and to become the inventors and\r\ncultivators of a new science, boundless in its views, and inexhaustible\r\nin its applications. The medical profession too was more particularly\r\nselected as an object of reward and encouragement; and we may say, with\r\nmuch truth, that our _Materia Medica_ is more indebted to the zeal and\r\nindustry of the Arabians, than to the learning of the Greeks, or to the\r\nrefinement of the Romans. From this source we have acquired the milder\r\npurges of _Manna_, _Cassia_, _Senna_, _Rhubarb_, and many plants and\r\noriental aromatics, amongst, which we may notice _Musk_, _Nutmeg_,\r\n_Mace_, and _Cloves_; the introduction of which into medicine was\r\ngreatly facilitated by the situation of Bagdat, and its connection with\r\nIndia; and although Archigenes and Aretæus had long before applied\r\n_Blisters_, yet it is to the Arabian physicians that we are indebted for\r\na practical acquaintance with their value, for in general, the Greeks\r\nand Romans prescribed acrid _Sinapisms_ for such a purpose. We are also\r\nindebted to the Arabians for our knowledge respecting Camphor, as its\r\nname imports, for the original word was _Cafur_ or _Canfur_.[100] They\r\nare also the first upon record, who speak of sugar, and sugar-candy,\r\nextracted from the sugar-cane, which they call _honey of cane_; and they\r\nushered into practice _Syrups_, _Juleps_, and _Conserves_. At the same\r\ntime, it is but just to allow, that from the disgusting ostentation of\r\nthis people, and their strong attachment to the marvellous, many absurd\r\nmedicines have been introduced. Gold, Silver, Bezoars, and precious\r\nstones were received into their materia medica, and surprising virtues\r\nwere attributed to them. Amongst a people thus disposed to magnificence,\r\nand from the very spirit of their religion credulous and romantic, it is\r\nnot a matter of surprise that their first researches into the nature of\r\nbodies should have raised a hope, and excited a belief, that the baser\r\nmetals might be converted into gold.\r\n\r\nThey conceived that gold was the metallic element, in a state of perfect\r\npurity, and that all the other metals differed from it in proportion\r\nonly to the extent of their individual contamination, and hence the\r\norigin of the epithet _base_, as applied to such metals; this hypothesis\r\nexplains the origin of alchemy; but, in every history, we are informed\r\nthat the earlier alchemists expected, by the same means that they hoped\r\nto convert the _baser_ metals into gold, to produce a universal remedy,\r\ncalculated to prolong indefinitely the span of human existence.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to imagine what connection could exist in their ideas\r\nbetween the “_Philosopher’s Stone_,” which was to transmute metals, and\r\na remedy which could arrest the progress of bodily infirmity: upon\r\nsearching into the writings of these times, it clearly appears that this\r\nconceit originated with the alchemists from the application of false\r\nanalogies, and that the error was subsequently diffused and exaggerated\r\nby a misconstruction of alchemical metaphors.[101]\r\n\r\nAn example of reasoning by false analogy is presented to us by\r\nParacelsus, in his work _de vita longa_, wherein, speaking of anatomy,\r\nhe exclaims: “_Sicut antimonium finit aurum, sic, eadem ratione et\r\nforma, corpus humanum purum reddit._”\r\n\r\nThe processes of alchemy were always veiled in the most enigmatic and\r\nobscure language; the earliest alchemist whose name has reached\r\nposterity, is Geber, an Arabian prince of the seventh century, whose\r\nlanguage was so proverbially obscure, that Dr. Johnson supposes the word\r\ngibberish or _geberish_ to have been derived from this circumstance;\r\nsometimes the processes of alchemy were expressed by a figurative and\r\nmetaphorical style of description; thus Geber exclaims, “_Bring me the\r\nsix lepers that I may cleanse them_;” by which he implied the conversion\r\nof the six metals,[102] the only ones then known, into gold. From the\r\nworks of later alchemists it also appears that they constantly\r\nrepresented _gold_ as a sound, healthy, and durable man, the imperfect\r\nmetals as diseased men, and the means or processes by which the latter\r\nwere to be transmuted into the former, they designated by the name of\r\n_medicines_; and hence, those who were anxious to dive into the secrets\r\nof these magicians, or =Adepts=, as they termed themselves, without\r\npossessing a key to their language, supposed that these descriptions\r\nwere to be understood in a literal sense, and that the imperfect metals\r\nmight be changed into gold, and the bodies of sick persons into healthy\r\nones, by one and the same chemical preparation.\r\n\r\nThe hieroglyphical style of writing adopted by the earlier alchemists,\r\nwas in a great degree supported by the prevailing idea that the elements\r\nwere under the dominion of spiritual beings, who might be submitted to\r\nhuman power; and Sir Humphry Davy has observed that the notions of\r\nfairies, and of genii, which have been depicted with so much vividness\r\nof fancy and liveliness of description in THE THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS,\r\nseem to have been connected with the pursuit of the science of\r\ntransmutation, and the production of the elixir of life. That the\r\nArabian Nights’ Entertainment admits of a mystic interpretation, is an\r\nopinion which I have long entertained. How strikingly is the effect of\r\nfermented spirit, in banishing the pressure of the melancholy which\r\noccurs in solitude, depicted in the story of Sinbad when he encountered\r\nthe withered and decrepid hag, on the uninhabited island—but, to return\r\nfrom this digression to the subject of medical chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt was not in fact until several years had elapsed in the delusive\r\nresearches of alchemy, that the application of chemical knowledge became\r\ninstrumental in the advancement of the medical art. RHASES and AVICENNA,\r\nwho were the celebrated physicians of the age, are the first who\r\nintroduced pharmaceutical preparations into their works, or made any\r\nimprovement in the mode of conducting pharmaceutical processes. Avicenna\r\ndescribes, particularly, the method of conducting _Distillation_; he\r\nmentions also, for the first time, the three _Mineral Acids_, and\r\ndistinguishes between the _vegetable_ and _mineral Alkalies_; he speaks\r\nlikewise of the _Distilled Water of Roses_, of _Sublimed Arsenic_, and\r\nof _Corrosive Sublimate_.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1226, ROGER BACON, a native of Ilchester in Somersetshire,\r\nand a Franciscan monk of Westminster Abbey, laid the foundations of\r\nchemical science in Europe; his discoveries were so extraordinary that\r\nhe was excommunicated by the Pope, and imprisoned ten years for supposed\r\ndealings with the devil; it appears that he was a believer in an\r\nuniversal Elixir, for he proposed one to Pope Clement the Tenth, which\r\nhe extolled highly, as the invention of Petro de Maharncourt.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful man was succeeded at the end of the same century by\r\nArnoldus de Villa Nova, a Frenchman, or as others assert, a Spaniard,\r\nwho deserves to be noticed on this occasion, as being the first to\r\nrecommend the distilled spirit of wine, impregnated with certain herbs,\r\nas a valuable remedy; from which we may date the introduction of\r\n_Tinctures_ into medical practice; for, although Thaddæus, a Florentine,\r\nwho died in 1270, at the age of eighty, bestows great commendation upon\r\nthe virtues of _Spirit of Wine_, yet he never used it as a solvent for\r\nactive vegetable matter.\r\n\r\nIt was not however until the end of the thirteenth century, that\r\nChemistry can be said to have added any considerable power to the arm of\r\nPhysic.\r\n\r\nBASIL VALENTINE, a German Benedictine monk, led the way to the internal\r\nadministration of metallic medicine, by a variety of experiments on the\r\nnature of _Antimony_, and in his “_Currus Triumphalis Antimonii_,” a\r\nwork written in high Dutch, he has described a number of the\r\ncombinations of that metal. If however we may credit a vague tradition,\r\nhe was extremely unfortunate in his first experiments upon his brother\r\nmonks, all of whom he injured if not killed; those who have keen ears\r\nfor etymological sounds will instantly recognise, in this circumstance,\r\nthe origin of the word _Antimony_,—ἁντί Μονοχους.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the ancients were ignorant of the internal use and\r\nadministration of the metals, with the exception of iron, although they\r\nfrequently used them in external applications. Hippocrates recommends\r\n_Lead_ in several parts of his works, as an _epulotic_ application, and\r\nfor other external purposes. _Litharge of Gold_ and _Cerusse_ also\r\nentered the composition of several powders extolled by that ancient\r\nphysician as possessing great efficacy in defluxions of the eyes.\r\nOribasius and Ætius added “_Lithargyrium_” to several plaisters, and the\r\ncomposition of the “_Snow-like plaister_,” from _Minium_, was long\r\npreserved amongst their most valuable secrets. Whether antimony is the\r\n_Stimmi_ or _Stibium_ of the ancients has been a matter of conjecture;\r\nfor Pliny, in speaking of its preparation observes, “Ante omnia urendi\r\nmodus necessarius, ne _Plumbum_ fiat.” This plumbum however was\r\nevidently the revived metal of _Antimony_, with which the ancients were\r\nunacquainted, and therefore mistook it for _Lead_; besides, the word\r\n_Plumbum_, like many others which I have before mentioned, was used as a\r\ngeneral term; thus, according to Pliny, Tin was called _Plumbum album_;\r\nand Agricola calls Lead Plumbum _nigrum_.[103]\r\n\r\nThe question however is unimportant, for this _Stibium_ was never used\r\nbut as an external Astringent, especially for the purpose of contracting\r\nthe eye-lids, and thereby of making the eyes appear very large, which\r\nhas been considered from the most remote antiquity, as a feature of\r\ngreat beauty; thus the epithet βοῶπὶς is constantly applied by Homer to\r\nJuno. This practice appears also to have been followed by the Jews, for\r\nJezebel is said to have painted her eye-brows to make the eyes appear\r\nbig;[104] the expression also shews that the drug employed was the\r\n_Stimmi_. Εστὶμμὶσατο τους οφθαλμους ἁυτης.\r\n\r\nTo BASIL VALENTINE we are moreover indebted for the discovery of the\r\n_Volatile Alkali_, and of its preparation from _Sal Ammoniac_; he also\r\nfirst used mineral acids as solvents, and noticed the production of\r\n_Ether_ from Alcohol; he seems also to have understood the virtues of\r\n_sulphate of iron_, for he says, when internally administered, it is\r\ntonic and comforting to a weak stomach, and that externally applied, it\r\nis astringent and styptic: he moreover recommended a _fixed alkali_ made\r\nfrom vine twigs cut in the beginning of March, for the cure of gout and\r\ngravel.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1493, was born near Zurich in Switzerland, PARACELSUS, or as\r\nhe termed himself, Philippus, Theophrastus, Bombastus, Paracelsus de\r\nHohenheim, a man who was destined to produce a greater revolution in the\r\nMateria Medica, and a greater change in medical opinions and practice,\r\nthan any person who had appeared since the days of Galen. He travelled\r\nall over the Continent of Europe to obtain knowledge in Chemistry and\r\nPhysic, and was a great admirer of Basil Valentine, declaring that\r\nAntimony was not to be equalled for medicinal virtue, by any other\r\nsubstance in nature: this opinion however does not deserve our respect,\r\nfor it was not founded upon observation and experiment, but on a\r\nfanciful analogy, derived from a property which this metal possesses of\r\nrefining gold, as I have before related. He also used _Mercury_ without\r\nreserve, and appears to have been the first who ventured to administer\r\nit internally,[105] for although Avicenna asserts that it was not so\r\npoisonous as the ancients had imagined, yet he does not attribute to it\r\nany virtues; he merely says, “Argentum quidem vivum, plurimi qui bibunt,\r\n_non læduntur_ eo.” Its effects, when applied externally, were well\r\nknown to Theodoric the friar, afterwards Bishop of Cervia, in the\r\ntwelfth century, who describes the salivation which mercurial frictions\r\nwill produce. Paracelsus, moreover, employed Lead internally in\r\nfevers,—“_Saturnus purgat febres_” was one of his most favourite maxims.\r\nHe also gives us directions for the preparation of _Red Precipitate_\r\nwith _Mercury_ and _Aqua fortis_.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, thus armed with opium, mercury, and antimony, remedies of no\r\ntrifling importance, travelled in all directions and performed many\r\nextraordinary cures, amongst which was that of the famous printer\r\nFrobenius of Basil, a circumstance which immediately brought him\r\nacquainted with Erasmus,[106] and made him known to the magistracy of\r\nBasil, who elected him professor of chemistry in the year 1527, which\r\nwas the first professorship that was established in Europe for the\r\npromotion and dissemination of chemical science. But notwithstanding\r\nthis testimony of his success, if we may credit Libavius, he often, like\r\nour modern quacks, left his patients more diseased than he found them;\r\nand it is acknowledged by his own disciple Oporinus, that when he was\r\nsent for to any town, for the purpose of administering his remedies, he\r\nwas rarely suffered to protract his visit, on account of the general\r\nresentment of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhile seated in his chair, he burnt with great solemnity the writings of\r\nGalen and Avicenna, and declared to his audience that if God would not\r\nimpart the secrets of physic, it was not only allowable but even\r\njustifiable to consult the devil. His cotemporary physicians he treated\r\nwith the most sottish vanity and illiberal insolence; in the preface to\r\nhis work entitled “Paragranum,” he tells them “that the very down of his\r\nbald pate had more knowledge than all their writers, the buckles of his\r\nshoes more learning than Galen and Avicenna, and his beard more\r\nexperience than all their Universities.” With such a temper it could not\r\nbe supposed that he would long retain his chair, in fact he quitted it\r\nin consequence of a quarrel with the magistrates, after which he\r\ncontinued to ramble about the country, generally intoxicated, and seldom\r\nchanging his clothes, or even going to bed; and although he boasted of\r\npossessing a _Panacea_ which was capable of curing all diseases in an\r\ninstant, and even of prolonging life to an indefinite length, yet this\r\ndrunkard and prince of empirics died after a few hours illness, in the\r\nforty-eighth year of his age, at Salzburg in Bavaria, with a bottle of\r\nhis immortal _Catholicon_ in his pocket.\r\n\r\nIn contemplating the career of this extraordinary man, it is difficult\r\nto say whether disgust or astonishment is the most predominant feeling;\r\nhis insolence and unparalleled conceit, his insincerity, and brutal\r\nsingularities, and his habits of immorality and debauchery, are beyond\r\nall censure; whilst the important services he has rendered mankind, by\r\nopposing the bigotry of the schools and introducing powerful remedies\r\ninto practice, cannot be recorded without feelings of gratitude and\r\nrespect: but in whatever estimation Paracelsus may be held, there can be\r\nno doubt but that his fame produced a very considerable influence on the\r\ncharacter of the age, by exciting the envy of some, the emulation of\r\nothers, and the industry of all.[107]\r\n\r\nAbout a century after Paracelsus, VAN HELMONT took the lead in physic;\r\nhe was a man of most indefatigable industry, and spent fifty years in\r\ntorturing by every chemical experiment he could devise, the various\r\nobjects in the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms. He was the first\r\nphysician who applied _alum_ in uterine hemorrhage, and he acquired a\r\ngreat reputation from the success of the practice.\r\n\r\nSYLVIUS DE LA BOE, and OTHO TACHENIUS, followed in the track of Van\r\nHelmont.\r\n\r\nA prejudice in favour of chemical remedies having been thus introduced,\r\nthe merited success which attended their operation, and the zeal and\r\nperseverance which distinguished the votaries of that science, soon\r\nkindled a more general enthusiasm in its favour. It is impossible to\r\nreduce into miniature the historical features of these chemical times,\r\nso as to bring them within the compass of a lecture: I must therefore\r\nrest satisfied with delineating a few of the more prominent outlines.\r\nThe Galenists, who were in possession of the schools, and whose\r\nreasonings were fettered by the strongest predilection for their own\r\ndoctrines, instantly took the alarm; and the celebrated contest ensued\r\nbetween the _Galenical_ and _Chemical_ sects, which has given such a\r\ncontroversial tone to the writers of the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\ncenturies. As this revolt from orthodox authority was in a great degree\r\nattributed to the mischievous introduction and unmerited success of\r\nAntimonial remedies, so were the preparations of this metal denounced\r\nwith all the virulence of party spirit;[108] and upon this occasion, in\r\norder to support their ground and oppress and persecute their\r\nadversaries, the Galenists actually solicited the assistance of secular\r\npower; the Supreme Council of Paris accordingly proscribed its use by an\r\nedict in 1566, and Besnier was expelled the faculty of medicine in 1609,\r\nfor having administered it to a patient. In 1637, _Antimonial wine_ was\r\nby public authority received into the number of purgatives; and in 1650,\r\na new _arrêt_ rescinded that of 1566, and again restored Antimony to\r\npublic favour and general reputation; and before we conclude our remarks\r\nupon the revolutionary history of this extraordinary metal, it deserves\r\nto be remarked, that this very same government that had with such great\r\nvirulence, and so little justice, persecuted every practitioner who had\r\nshewn any predilection for its use, in the year 1720 actually purchased\r\nthe secret of an antimonial preparation called _Panacea Glauberiana_,\r\nand which has been since known by the title of _Kermes Mineral_, from a\r\nsurgeon of the name of La Legerie, who had acquired the secret from a\r\npupil of Glauber. Before this period the invention of _Calomel_ had\r\ntaken place; this preparation is first mentioned, although very\r\nobscurely, by Oswald Crollius, in his _Basilica Chemica_, in 1608, and\r\nin the same year Beguin described it most fully and clearly under the\r\ntitle of _Draco Mitigatus_, in his _Tirocinium Chemicum_, which he\r\npublished in Paris.\r\n\r\nChemistry, at this period[109] took possession of the schools, and\r\nwhilst it was gradually grafted into the theory of medicine, it soon\r\nbecame the only guide to its practice, the absurdity of which has been\r\nalready dwelt upon.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the march of chemical improvement during the last century, we\r\ncannot but be struck with the new and powerful remedies which it has\r\nintroduced, and the many unimportant and feeble articles which it has\r\ndismissed from medical practice.\r\n\r\nIn the present century, the rapid progress of Chemistry has outstripped\r\nthe anticipations of its most sanguine votaries; and even in the\r\ndepartment of vegetable analysis, a correctness has been attained, the\r\nvery attempt at which had been abandoned by the most illustrious\r\nchemists of the former age as hopeless and chimerical; let us for\r\ninstance only compare the results obtained by the Academicians of Paris,\r\nand published by Geoffroy, in their analyses of several hundred plants\r\nby the operation of heat, with the elegant and satisfactory researches\r\nin this branch of science lately conducted in the same country; whilst\r\nthe former failed in establishing any distinction between the most inert\r\nand the most poisonous plants, the latter have succeeded in detecting,\r\nseparating, and concentrating several of their most subtile\r\nconstituents. _Opium_ has been at length compelled to confess its secret\r\nsource of action, and _Ipecacuan_ to yield its emetic element in a state\r\nof perfect purity.\r\n\r\nOur Pharmacopœias and Dispensatories[110] have cautiously kept pace\r\nwith the scientific progress of the age; and in tracing them from\r\ntheir origin to the present time[111] it is gratifying to observe the\r\ngradual influence of knowledge in reducing the number of their\r\narticles—simplifying the composition of their formulæ—and improving\r\nthe processes for their preparation.[112] Chemistry has also been the\r\nmeans of establishing the identity of many bodies which were long\r\nconsidered as specifically different; thus an extensive list of animal\r\nsubstances has been discarded, since it is known that they owe their\r\nproperties to one and the same common principle, as to _gelatine_,\r\n_albumen_, _carbonate of lime_, &c.; so again the fixed alkaline salt\r\nproduced by the incineration of different vegetables, has been found\r\nto be potass, from whatever plant it may have been obtained, with the\r\nexception of sea plants, and perhaps some of the Tetradynamia, the\r\nformer of which yield _Soda_ and the latter _Ammonia_. Previous to the\r\nPharmacopœia of 1745, every vegetable was supposed to yield a salt\r\nessentially different, and therefore a number of alkaline preparations\r\nwere recommended, each bearing the name of the particular plant from\r\nwhich it had been procured, as salt of _Wormwood_—salt of\r\n_Broom_,—_Salt of Bean-Stalks_, &c.\r\n\r\nBut, from the very nature and object of a Pharmacopœia, it cannot be\r\nsupposed to proceed _pari passu_ with the march of chemical science,\r\nindeed it would be dangerous that it should, for a chemical theory must\r\nreceive the seal and stamp of experience before it can become current: a\r\nPharmacopœia however is always an object of abuse, because it is a\r\nnational work of authority, which is quite a sufficient reason why the\r\nignorant and conceited should question its title to respect, and its\r\nclaim to utility. “_Plures audivi_,” says Huxham, “_totas blaterantes\r\nPharmacopœias, qui tamen ne intellexerint quidem quid vel ipse pulsus\r\nsignificabat_.”\r\n\r\nIt is very evident, that the greater number of these attacks has not\r\nbeen levelled with any view to elicit truth or to advance science, but\r\nto excite public attention, and to provoke unfair discussion for\r\nindividual and unworthy advantage; their obscure and presumptuous\r\nauthors vainly hope, that they may gain for their ephemeral writings\r\nsome share of importance, and for themselves some degree of reputation,\r\nif they can only obtain notoriety by provoking a discussion with the\r\nCollege or with some of its responsible members, though such a combat\r\nshould be sure to terminate in their defeat. Like the Scythian Abaris,\r\nwho upon being wounded by Apollo, plucked the arrow from his side, and\r\nheedless of the pain and disgrace of his wound, exclaimed in triumph\r\nthat the weapon would in future enable him to deliver Oracles.\r\n\r\nIt is not to such persons that the observations which are contained in\r\nthis work are addressed, for with them I am most anxious to avoid a\r\ncontest, in which, as a worthy Fellow of our College expresses it,\r\n“_Victory itself must be disgraceful_.”\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we are assailed upon every occasion by a gentleman whose\r\ntalents entitle him to respect, and whose public situation commands\r\nnotice, I apprehend that a humble individual like myself, may, in the\r\nconscientious discharge of a public duty, deliver his sentiments from\r\nthe chair to which he has been called by his professional brethren,\r\nwithout any risk of compromising the dignity of the College, or of\r\ndrawing upon himself the charge of an unnecessary and injudicious\r\ninterference.\r\n\r\nThe attack to which I chiefly allude, is contained in an historical\r\npreface by Mr. Professor Brande, to the _Supplement of the Fourth and\r\nFifth Editions of the Encyclopædia Britannica_; in which, speaking of\r\nthe writings of BOERHAAVE, he says, “The observations which he has made\r\nupon the usefulness of Chemistry, and of its necessity to the medical\r\npractitioner, may be well enforced at the present day; for, except in\r\nthe schools of London and Edinburgh, Chemistry, as a branch of\r\neducation, is either entirely neglected, or, what is perhaps worse,\r\nsuperficially and imperfectly taught; this is especially the case in the\r\nEnglish Universities, and the London Pharmacopœia is a record of the\r\nwant of chemical knowledge, where it is most imperiously required.”\r\n\r\nThe learned Professor of Oxford, Dr. Kidd, naturally anxious to repel a\r\ncharge which he considered individually unfair, and to vindicate his\r\nUniversity from an aspersion which he felt to be generally unjust,\r\npublished an animated, but at the same time, a cool and candid defence,\r\nto which I have much pleasure in referring you. With respect to the\r\nSister University, my own _Alma Mater_, I feel that I should be the most\r\nungrateful of her sons, were I, upon this occasion, to omit expressing\r\nsimilar sentiments with respect to the course of chemistry, and that of\r\nits collateral branches, which are annually delivered in the crouded\r\nschools at Cambridge. Is Mr. Brande acquainted with the discipline of\r\nour University?—Is he aware that the chemical chair has been\r\nsuccessively filled by BISHOP WATSON—MILNER—WOLLASTON[113]—and the late\r\nlamented Mr. TENNANT?—“_Master Builders in the Science_.” To say that\r\nsuch men have been the lecturers, is surely a sufficient testimony to\r\nshew that the science of chemistry heretofore _could not_ “have been\r\nneglected, or what perhaps is still worse, imperfectly taught;” and the\r\nzeal and ability displayed by the present Professor, ought to have\r\nshielded him from any such attack. Is Mr. Brande aware that the eloquent\r\nappeal of BISHOP WATSON from the chair at Cambridge,[114] on the general\r\nimportance and utility of chemistry, gave the first impulse to that\r\npublic taste for this science which so eminently distinguishes our\r\nAugustan age, and which has been the means of founding and supporting\r\nthe Royal, and other Public Institutions in this Metropolis, as well as\r\nin the other towns of the British Empire?\r\n\r\nI need make no farther remark upon this part of Mr. Brande’s assertion;\r\nthe sequel, judging from the construction of the sentence, is evidently\r\nintended to be understood as a consequence, viz. and _therefore_ “the\r\nLondon Pharmacopœia is a record of the want of chemical knowledge where\r\nit is most imperiously required,” _because Oxford and Cambridge\r\nPhysicians were its Editors_. Is not this the obvious construction?\r\n\r\nIt appears from Mr. Brande’s laconic answer to Dr. Young, published in\r\n“_The Journal of Science and the Arts_,” that his objections are those\r\nof Mr. Phillips, contained in his experimental examination of the\r\nPharmacopœia; a work which, I confess, appears to me to furnish a\r\ntestimony of the experimental tact, subtile ingenuity, and caustic style\r\nof criticism, which its author so eminently possesses, rather than a\r\nproof of any fatal or material inaccuracy in the Pharmacopœia; and I may\r\nurge this with greater force and propriety, when it is considered that,\r\nat the time of its publication, I was not a Fellow of the College, and\r\ntherefore had no voice upon the subject of its composition, and\r\nconsequently must be _personally_ disinterested in its reputation.\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude these observations upon Mr. Brande’s attack, without\r\nexpressing a deep feeling of regret, that a gentleman, whose deserved\r\nrank in society, and whose talents and acquirements must entitle him to\r\nour respect, should have condescended to countenance and encourage that\r\nvile and wretched taste of depreciating the value and importance of our\r\nmost venerable institutions, and of bringing into contempt those\r\nacknowledged authorities which must always meet with the approbation of\r\nthe best, and the sanction and support of the wisest portion of mankind.\r\n\r\nAnd I shall here protest against the prevailing fashion of examining and\r\ndeciding upon the pretensions of every medicinal compound to our\r\nconfidence, by a _mere chemical_ investigation of its composition, and\r\nof rejecting, as fallacious, every medical testimony which may appear\r\ncontradictory to the results of the Laboratory; there is no subject in\r\nscience to which the maxim of Cicero more strictly applies, than to the\r\npresent case; let the _Ultra_ Chemist therefore cherish it in his\r\nremembrance, and profit by its application—“PRÆSTAT NATURÆ VOCE DOCERI,\r\nQUAM INGENIO SUO SAPERE.”\r\n\r\nHas not experience fully established the value of many medicinal\r\ncombinations, which, at the time of their adoption could not receive the\r\nsanction of any chemical law? We well remember the opposition, which on\r\nthis ground was for a long time offered to the introduction of the\r\n_Anti-hectic Mixture_ of Dr. Griffith,—the _Mistura Ferri Composita_ of\r\nthe present Pharmacopœia, and yet subsequent inquiry has confirmed upon\r\nscientific principles the justness of our former practical conclusion;\r\nfor it has been shewn that the chemical decompositions which constituted\r\nthe objection to its use, are in fact the causes of its utility (_see\r\nMist. Ferri_,); the explanation, moreover, has thrown additional light\r\nupon the theory of other preparations; so true is the observation of the\r\ncelebrated Morveau, that “_We never profit more than by these unexpected\r\nresults of Experiments, which contradict our Analogies and preconceived\r\nTheories_.”\r\n\r\nWhenever a medicine is found by experience to be effectual, the\r\npractitioner should listen with great circumspection to any _chemical_\r\nadvice for its correction or improvement. From a mistaken notion of this\r\nkind the _Extractum Colocynthidis compositum_, with a view of making it\r\nchemically compatible with _Calomel_, has been deprived of the _Soap_\r\nwhich formerly entered into its composition, in consequence of which its\r\nsolubility in the stomach is considerably modified, its activity is\r\ntherefore impaired, and its mildness diminished.[115]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, substances may be medically inconsistent, which are\r\nchemically compatible, as I shall have frequent opportunities of\r\nexemplifying. The stomach has a chemical code of its own, by which the\r\nusual affinities of bodies are frequently modified, often suspended, and\r\nsometimes entirely subverted; this truth is illustrated in a very\r\nstriking manner by the interesting experiments of M. Drouard, who found\r\nthat Copper, swallowed in its metallic state, was not rendered poisonous\r\nby meeting with oils, or fatty bodies; nor even with _Vinegar_, in the\r\ndigestive organs. Other bodies, on the contrary, seem to possess the\r\nsame habitudes in the stomach as in the laboratory, and are alike\r\ninfluenced in both situations by the chemical action of various bodies,\r\nmany examples of which are to be found under the consideration of the\r\ninfluence which solubility exerts upon the medicinal activity of\r\nsubstances; so again, acidity in the stomach is neutralized by\r\n_Alkalies_, and if a _Carbonate_ be employed for that purpose, we have a\r\ncopious disengagement of _Carbonic acid gas_, which has been frequently\r\nvery distressing to the patient; lastly, many bodies taken into the\r\nstomach undergo decompositions and changes _in transitu_, independent of\r\nany play of chemical affinities from the hidden powers of digestion,\r\nsome of which we are enabled to appreciate, and they will accordingly\r\nform a subject of investigation in the course of the present work.\r\n\r\nThe powers of the stomach would seem to consist in decomposing the\r\n_Ingesta_, and reducing them into simpler forms, rather than in\r\ncomplicating them, by favouring new combinations.\r\n\r\nBut every rational physician must feel in its full force, the absurdity\r\nof expecting to account for the phænomena of life upon principles\r\ndeduced from the analogies of inert matter, and we therefore find that\r\nthe most intelligent physiologists of modern times have been anxious to\r\ndiscourage the attempt, and to deprecate its folly. Sir Gilbert Blane,\r\nin his luminous work on MEDICAL LOGIC, when speaking of the different\r\ntheories of digestion, tells us that Dr. William Hunter, whose peculiar\r\nsagacity and precision of mind detected at a glance the hollowness of\r\nsuch delusive hypotheses, and saw the danger which theorists run in\r\ntrusting themselves on such slippery ground, expressed himself in his\r\npublic lectures, with that solidity of judgment combined with\r\nfacetiousness of expression, which rendered him unparalleled as a public\r\nteacher. “Gentlemen,” said he, “Physiologists will have it that the\r\nstomach is a mill—others, that it is a fermenting-vat—others again, that\r\nit is a stew-pan,—but in my view of the matter, it is neither a mill, a\r\nfermenting-vat, nor a stew-pan—but a STOMACH, Gentlemen, a STOMACH.”\r\n\r\nWhat can illustrate in a more familiar and striking manner the singular\r\npowers of _Gastric Chemistry_, than the fact of the shortness of time in\r\nwhich the aliment becomes acid in depraved digestion? A series of\r\nchanges is thus produced in a few hours, which would require in the\r\nlaboratory as many weeks,[116] while in acute affections of the\r\nalimentary canal the functions of the stomach are nearly suspended, and\r\nhence under such circumstances, whatever is introduced into this organ\r\nremains unchanged, even the nutritious mucilages are not digested.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said, it is very evident that the mere chemist can\r\nhave no pretensions to the art of composing or discriminating\r\nremedies; whenever he arraigns the scientific propriety of our\r\nPrescriptions, in direct contradiction to the deductions of true\r\nmedical experience,—whenever he forsakes his laboratory for the\r\nbed-side, he forfeits all his claims to our respect, and his title to\r\nour confidence. It is amusing to see the ridiculous errors into which\r\nthe chemist falls, when he turns physician; as soon as Seguin found\r\nthat Peruvian bark contained a peculiar principle that precipitated\r\n_Tannin_, he immediately concluded that this _could not be any other_\r\nthan _Gelatine_, and upon the faith of this blunder, the French,\r\nItalian, and German physicians,[117] gave their patients nothing but\r\n_Clarified Glue_, in intermittent fevers!—But I desist—not however\r\nwithout expressing a hope, in which I am sure my medical brethren will\r\nconcur, that, should Mr. Brande again condescend to favour us with a\r\ncommentary upon Boerhaave, he will select that passage in his work,\r\nwhere, alluding to the application of Chemistry to Physic, he\r\nemphatically exclaims, “EGREGIA ILLIUS ANCILLA EST, NON ALIA PEJOR\r\nDOMINA.”\r\n\r\n\r\n          THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL, CULTURE, CLIMATE, AND SEASON.\r\n\r\nThe facts hitherto collected upon this subject are so scanty and\r\nunsatisfactory, that I introduce its consideration in this place, rather\r\nwith a wish to excite farther enquiry, than with any hope of imparting\r\nmuch additional information.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt, but that Soil, Culture, Climate, and\r\nSeason,[118] may very materially influence the active properties of a\r\nmedicinal plant; while the two latter of these causes may as essentially\r\nchange the type and character of a disease, and modify the vital\r\nsusceptibility of the patient; the natives of the south of Europe, for\r\ninstance, do not bear bleeding, and other modes of depletion, so well as\r\nthose of the north. This must be admitted to its full extent, or it will\r\nbe extremely difficult to explain the contradictory and even opposite\r\nopinions, and to reconcile the conflicting testimonies of the physicians\r\nof different countries, with respect to the efficacy of the same remedy,\r\nin similar diseases.\r\n\r\nTHE INFLUENCE OF SOIL may be exemplified by many well known facts; thus,\r\nstrongly smelling plants lose their odour in a sandy soil, and do not\r\nagain recover it by transplantation into a richer one; a fact upon which\r\nRozier founded his proposal for the improvement of Rape oil; so again,\r\nno management could induce the _Ricotia Ægyptiaca_ to flower, until\r\nLinnæus suggested the expediency of mixing clay with the earth in the\r\npot; _Assafœtida_ is one of those plants that vary much according to\r\nstation and soil, not only in the shape of the leaves, but in the\r\npeculiar nauseous quality of the juice which impregnates them, and Dr.\r\nWoodville states that it is frequently so modified that the leaves are\r\neaten by goats; Gmelin informs us, on the authority of Steller, that the\r\neffects of the _Rhododendron_ have been found to vary materially\r\naccording to the “_solum natale_;” for example, that produced in a\r\ncertain spot has proved uniformly _narcotic_, that in another,\r\n_cathartic_, while a sense of suffocation has been the only symptom\r\noccasioned by a third. Rhubarb, as grown in England, will differ greatly\r\nin its purgative qualities, according to the soil in which it may have\r\nbeen cultivated; that produced in a dry gravel being more efficacious\r\nthan that which is reared in a clayey one. Dr. Carter, in his account of\r\nthe “_Principal Hospitals of France, Italy, and Switzerland_,” tells us\r\nthat at Nice, the _Digitalis_ is commonly given in doses of a scruple in\r\npowder, or in that of half an ounce of the infusion made according to\r\nthe London Pharmacopœia, every hour, and without any sensible effect;\r\nthis fact he explains by stating that the _Digitalis_, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Nice, is much smaller, and is probably less powerful\r\nthan the same plant as it grows in England.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE also produces a powerful impression upon vegetable and animal\r\nlife. It is probable that in southern countries some vegetables enjoy\r\nmore energetic properties than in northern climes. The history of opium\r\nimmediately countenances such an opinion; thus Egypt produces a stronger\r\n_opium_ than any of the countries on the north side of the\r\nMediterranean,—France, than England or Germany;—and Languedoc, than the\r\nnorthern parts of France;—while Smyrna, Natolia, Aleppo, and Apulia,\r\nfurnish a juice far more narcotic than Languedoc: so again, _Senna_ by\r\ntransplantation from Arabia into the south of France (Provence) assumes\r\na marked change in its physiognomy and virtues, its leaves are more\r\nobtuse, and its taste less bitter and nauseous than the pointed leaved\r\nvariety, while its effects will be found to be less purgative.\r\n_Cruciform_ plants degenerate within the tropics, but acquire increased\r\nenergies, as _Antiscorbutics_, in cold regions; the _Menthæ_ have not so\r\npenetrating an essential oil in the south of Europe as in England and in\r\nthe north of France. The relative proportions of gluten vary in the\r\nwheat of different countries, and as in the south of Europe, its\r\nquantity greatly predominates over the other principles, we at once\r\ndiscover the cause that gives such excellence to the Maccaroni of Italy.\r\nMany species of plants secrete juices in warmer regions, which are\r\nunknown in their œconomy, in colder climates; thus the Ash yields\r\n_Manna_ in Calabria, but loses that faculty as it advances towards the\r\nnorth. The influence of climate, in its relations to moisture and\r\ndryness, upon vegetable productions, is also worthy of investigation; in\r\nwet and cold seasons, our herbage is far less nutritive to cattle, and\r\nwe accordingly find that they are constantly grazing, in order to\r\ncompensate by quantity, for what is deficient in quality, whereas in dry\r\nseasons, a larger proportion of their time is consumed in rumination;\r\nthe same causes, however, that diminish the nutritive powers of plants,\r\nfrequently increase the energy of those principles upon which their\r\nmedicinal value depends: it is obvious that many herbs are more rank and\r\nvirulent in wet and gloomy seasons: this would appear to be a wise and\r\nprovident law, in order to apportion the natural condiment of the\r\nvegetable, to the deteriorated state of its nutritive elements, when the\r\ndigestive organs must require more than the ordinary stimulus for the\r\ndue exercise of their functions. It is hardly necessary to observe that\r\nplants, which in temperate climates are merely shrubs, have been\r\ndeveloped into trees, by the hot and humid plains of Africa and Asia;\r\nwhile in the arid deserts of Nubia or in the frigid plains of Siberia,\r\nvegetable life is confined to stunted shrubs and humble mosses: cold\r\nalso suppresses the colour of flowers, and indeed even that of the\r\nleaves, as is witnessed in the _Cyclamen_, _Amaranthus_, and\r\n_Ranunculus_ of Lapland and Siberia. But climate not only modifies the\r\npowers of a remedy by influencing its structure and composition, but it\r\nrenders it more or less active, by increasing or diminishing the\r\nsusceptibility of the body to its impression; can a more striking proof\r\nof this fact be adduced than the well known effects of perfumes at Rome?\r\nThe inhabitants are unable to sustain the strong scent of flowers in\r\nthat climate, without experiencing a sensation highly oppressive, and\r\nwhich in some cases is even succeeded by syncope,[119] and thus\r\nrealising the well known line of the poet,\r\n\r\n                  “_Die of a Rose, in aromatic pain._”\r\n\r\nAs I have been favoured with some very interesting observations upon\r\nthis subject by Dr. Richard Harrison, who resided for a considerable\r\ntime in Italy, and was thus enabled to institute a satisfactory inquiry\r\ninto this curious subject, I feel no hesitation in introducing a\r\nquotation from his letter to my readers.—“You ask me what experience I\r\nhave had on the subject of climate, as affecting the powers and\r\noperation of remedies; I have no difficulty in asserting that Narcotics\r\nact with greater force even in smaller doses at Naples, where I had the\r\nadvantages of much experience, than in England. I might adduce as an\r\nexample the _Extract of Hyoscyamus_, which, when given to the extent of\r\nthree grains thrice a day, produced in two patients a temporary\r\namaurosis, which disappeared and again recurred on the alternate\r\nsuspension and administration of this medicine; and it deserves\r\nparticular notice that these very patients had been in the habit of\r\ntaking similar doses of the same remedy in England, without any\r\nunpleasant result. Now that this depended upon an increased\r\nsusceptibility of the patient, in the warmer climate, rather than an\r\nincreased power in the remedy, is unquestionable, since the extract\r\nwhich was administered in Italy had been procured from London; indeed a\r\nhigh state of nervous irritation is the prevalent disorder of Naples. I\r\ntreated several cases of Epilepsy in Italy with the _nitrate of silver_,\r\nand with complete success, while in England I certainly have not met\r\nwith the same successful results. During my residence at Naples, I spent\r\nsome time in the island of Ischia, so celebrated all over the continent\r\nfor its baths; many of the patients who were then trying their efficacy,\r\nhad been attacked by Paralysis, Apoplexy, and almost every degree of\r\nloss of mental and muscular power, and among them I certainly witnessed\r\nwhat with propriety might be denominated a genuine case of _Nervous\r\nApoplexy_. These complaints I was generally able to trace to the abuse\r\nof _Mercury_, whence we may, I think, very fairly conclude that this\r\nmetal is more active in its effects in that, than in our own country.\r\nBefore I quit this subject, I ought to mention that the doses of\r\nmedicines, as seen in the prescriptions and works of English Physicians,\r\nexcite universal astonishment among the faculty of Italy. In fact, as I\r\nhave just stated, the human constitution in this part of the continent\r\nis certainly more susceptible of nervous impression than in England: it\r\nis perfectly true that flowers or perfumes in a chamber, will frequently\r\nproduce syncope in persons apparently strong and healthy, and the fact\r\nis so universally admitted, that the Italians avoid them with the\r\ngreatest caution.” On the other hand, it appears equally evident that\r\nsome remedies succeed in cold climates which produce little or no\r\nbenefit in warmer latitudes. Soon after the publication of the first\r\nedition of my Pharmacologia, I received a letter from Dr. Halliday of\r\nMoscow, upon the subject of the “_Eau Medicinale_,” and as it offers a\r\nstriking proof of the efficacy of the _Rhododendron Chrysanthum_ in\r\ncuring the rheumatism of the North, whilst in this country the plant has\r\nbeen repeatedly tried without any signal proof of success, I shall here\r\nsubjoin an extract from the letter of my correspondent: “In reading your\r\naccount of the ‘_Eau Medicinale_,’ I perceive that, upon the authority\r\nof Mr. James Moore, you state it to be a preparation of the _White\r\nHellebore_; may I be allowed to suggest the probability of its being\r\nmade from the leaves of the _Rhododendron Chrysanthum_? for so far as I\r\ncan learn, the effects of the French medicine are precisely those which\r\nare experienced from an infusion of the above plant, which the Siberians\r\nand Russians regard as an infallible specific in the cure of chronic\r\nrheumatism and gout, and from which I myself, as well as other\r\nphysicians in Russia, have witnessed the most desirable and decided\r\neffects, whenever we had it in our power to administer the remedy with\r\nconfidence and courage. We have seldom given it in any other form or\r\ndose than that adopted by the Siberians themselves, which is to infuse\r\nin a warm place, generally near a furnace and during the night, two\r\ndrachms of the fresh leaves in about twelve ounces of boiling water,\r\ntaking care that the liquid never boils. This dose is to be taken in the\r\nmorning upon an empty stomach, and during its nauseating operation,\r\nwhich generally commences within a quarter of an hour after it has been\r\nswallowed, neither solids nor liquids of any description are allowed;\r\nafter an interval of three or four hours, I have seen the patient obtain\r\na copious and black fœtid stool, and get up free from pain. Should it\r\nhappen that the patient does not recover from the first dose, another is\r\nadministered on the succeeding day, and I have known it to be taken for\r\nthree days in succession, when the severest fits of gout have been\r\nremoved.[120] Is it not then probable that some cunning Frenchman has\r\navailed himself of this Siberian specific, and concentrated it in such a\r\nform, as to defy all the learned to find it out?”\r\n\r\nDr. Halliday adds, “The Siberians denominate the leaves of this plant,\r\nwhen infused in water, _Intoxicating Tea_; and a weaker infusion is in\r\ndaily use, especially for treating their neighbours, just as the\r\nEuropeans do with tea from China.”\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the consideration of Climate, as being capable of\r\ninfluencing the activity of a remedy, the important fact should not be\r\noverlooked, that in India, and other colonies of similar temperature,\r\nMercurial Medicines, in order to produce their beneficial effects,\r\nrequire to be administered to an extent which would prove destructive to\r\nthe inhabitants of this island.\r\n\r\nBut of all the circumstances that produce the greatest change in the\r\naspect as well as in the virtues of the vegetable creation, is\r\nCULTIVATION, which may either destroy the medicinal properties of a\r\nplant, or raise in it new and most valuable qualities: cultivation\r\nconverts single into double flowers, by developing the stamens into\r\npetals, a change which in many cases destroys their efficacy, as in the\r\ncamomile, _Anthemis Nobilis_; for, since all the virtues of this flower\r\nreside in the disc florets, it is of course greatly deteriorated by\r\nbeing converted into the double-flowered variety; by the operation of\r\n_grafting_ extraordinary changes may also be produced; Olivier, in his\r\ntravels, informs us that a soft _Mastiche_, having all the qualities of\r\nthat resin, except its consistence, which is that of turpentine, is\r\nprocured by engrafting the Lentisk on the Chian Turpentine tree.\r\n\r\nBuffon states that our wheat is a factitious production raised to its\r\npresent condition by the art of agriculture. M. Virey[121] observes,\r\nthat by suppressing the growth of one part of a plant we may\r\nrespectively give rise to an increased developement in others; thus are\r\nsome vegetables rendered eunuchs, or are deprived of seeds by\r\nobliteration, and only propagate themselves by slips; such a condition\r\nis frequently produced by culture, continued through a long succession\r\nof generations; this is the case with the _Banana_, _Sugar Cane_, and\r\nother fruits that have carefully been made to deviate for a long series\r\nof years from their original types, and having been continually\r\ntransplanted by slips, suckers, or roots, at length only propagate\r\nthemselves in this way, whereby the roots, as those of the common\r\npotatoe, become inordinately developed, drawing to themselves the\r\nsucculence and nutrition originally possessed by the berries. It seems\r\nprobable that we may thus have lost many vegetable species; the\r\n_Tuberes_ of Pliny, for example, are supposed by Mr. Andrew Knight to\r\nhave been intermediate productions, formed during the advancement of the\r\nAlmond to the Peach, or in other words that they were swollen almonds or\r\nimperfect peaches; if this conjecture be admitted, it will explain the\r\nfact stated by Columella, that the peach possessed deleterious qualities\r\nwhen it was first introduced from Persia into the Roman Empire. If there\r\nbe any who feel sceptical upon the subject of such metamorphoses, let\r\nhim visit the fairy bowers of Horticulture, and he will there perceive\r\nthat her magic wand has not only converted the tough, coriaceous\r\ncovering of the Almond into the soft and melting flesh of the Peach, but\r\nthat by her spells, the sour Sloe has ripened into the delicious Plum,\r\nand the austere Crab of our woods into the Golden Pippin; that this\r\nagain has been made to sport in endless variety, emulating in beauty of\r\nform and colour, in exuberance of fertility and in richness of flavour,\r\nthe rarer productions of warmer regions, and more propitious climates!\r\nIn our culinary vegetables the same progressive amelioration and\r\nadvancement may be traced; thus has the acrid and disagreeable _Apium\r\ngraveolens_ been changed into delicious _Celery_, and the common\r\n_Colewort_, by culture continued through many ages, appears under the\r\nimproved and more useful forms of Cabbage, Savoy, and Cauliflower. It\r\nhas been already observed that the alimentary and medicinal virtues are\r\nfrequently in opposition to each other, and that while cultivation\r\nimproves the former, it equally diminishes the latter; I shall have\r\noccasion to offer some additional facts upon this curious subject, under\r\nthe consideration of _Bitter Extractive_; _see Note on this Extract, in\r\nthe article_ “_Tonics_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n   THE IGNORANT PREPARATION AND FRAUDULENT ADULTERATION OF MEDICINES.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances comprehended under this head certainly deserve to be\r\nranked amongst the more powerful causes, which have operated in\r\naffecting the reputation of many medicinal substances. The Peruvian Bark\r\nfell into total discredit in the year 1779, from its inability to cure\r\nthe ague; and it was afterwards discovered to have been adulterated with\r\nbark of an inferior species; indeed Sydenham speaks of the adulteration\r\nof this substance before the year 1678; he tells us that he had never\r\nused to exceed two drachms of _Cinchona_ in the cure of any\r\nintermittent, but that of late the drug was so inert, rotten, and\r\nadulterated, it became necessary to increase its dose to one, two, or\r\nthree ounces. The subject is copious and full of importance, and I have\r\ntaken considerable pains to collect very fully, the various modes in\r\nwhich our remedies are thus deprived of their most valuable properties,\r\nand to suggest the best tests by which such frauds may be discovered.\r\nVery few practitioners have an idea of the alarming extent to which this\r\nnefarious practice is carried, or of the systematic manner in which it\r\nis conducted: there can be no doubt but that the sophistication of\r\nmedicines has been practised in degree in all ages,[122] but the\r\nrefinements of chemistry have enabled the manufacturers of the present\r\nday, not only to execute these frauds with greater address, but\r\nunfortunately, at the same time, to vend them with less chance of\r\ndetection. It will be scarcely credited, when I affirm that many hundred\r\npersons are supported in this metropolis by the art of adulterating\r\ndrugs, besides a number of women and children who find ample employment\r\nand excellent profit in _counterfeiting_ Cochineal with coloured dough,\r\nIsinglass with pieces of bladder and the dried skin of soles, and by\r\nfilling up with powdered Sassafras the holes which are bored in spice\r\nand nutmegs, for the purpose of plundering their essential oils.\r\n\r\n\r\n           THE UNSEASONABLE COLLECTION OF VEGETABLE REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nVegetable physiology has demonstrated, that during the progress of\r\nvegetation most remarkable changes occur in succession, in the chemical\r\ncomposition, as well as in the sensible qualities of a plant; time will\r\nnot allow me to be prodigal of examples, take therefore one which is\r\nfamiliar and striking,—the aromatic and spicy qualities of the\r\nunexpanded flowers of the _Caryophyllus Aromaticus_ (_Cloves_) are well\r\nknown to every body, but if the flower-bud be fully developed it loses\r\nthese properties altogether, and the fruit of the tree is not in the\r\nleast degree aromatic; so the berries of Pimento, when they come to full\r\nmaturity, lose their aromatic warmth and acquire a flavour very\r\nanalogous to that of Juniper. The _Colchicum autumnale_ may be cited as\r\nanother example in which the medicinal properties of the vegetable are\r\nentirely changed during the natural progress of its developement. See\r\nalso _Inspissated Juices_, under the article _Extract_.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE OBSCURITY WHICH HAS ATTENDED THE OPERATION OF COMPOUND MEDICINES.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the fallacies to which our observations and\r\nexperience are liable with respect to the efficacy of certain bodies, as\r\nremedies, must be necessarily multiplied when such bodies are exhibited\r\nin a state of complicated combination, since it must be always\r\ndifficult, and often impossible, to ascertain to which ingredient the\r\neffects produced ought to be attributed.\r\n\r\nHow many frivolous substances have from this cause alone gained a share\r\nof credit, which belonged exclusively to the medicines with which they\r\nhappened to be accidentally administered?[123] Numerous are the examples\r\nwhich I might adduce in proof of this assertion; the history of\r\nBezoar[124] would in itself furnish a mass of striking evidence, indeed\r\nthe reputation of this absurd substance was maintained much longer than\r\nit otherwise would have been, by its exhibition having been frequently\r\naccompanied with that of more active articles. Monardes, for instance,\r\nextols the efficacy of the _Bezoar_ as a vermifuge, but he states that\r\nit should be mixed with the seeds of _Wormwood_. Besides, in the\r\nexuberance of mixture, certain re-actions and important changes are\r\nmutually produced, by which the identity of the original ingredients is\r\ndestroyed; but this subject will be introduced for discussion in the\r\nfirst part of the Pharmacologia.\r\n\r\nThe practice of mixing together different medicinal substances, so as to\r\nform one remedy, may boast of very ancient origin, for most of the\r\nprescriptions which have descended from the Greek physicians are of this\r\ndescription; the uncertain and vague results of such a practice appear\r\nalso to have been early felt, and often condemned, and even Erasistratus\r\ndeclaimed with great warmth against the complicated medicines which were\r\nadministered in his time; the greater number of these compositions\r\npresent a mass of incongruous materials, put together without any\r\napparent order or intention; indeed it would almost appear as if they\r\nregarded a medical formula as a problem in _Permutation_, the only\r\nobject of which was to discover and assign the number of changes that\r\ncan be made in any given number of things, all different from each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must in justice be allowed, that some of the earlier\r\nphysicians entertained just notions with regard to the use and abuse of\r\ncombination, although their knowledge of the subject was of course\r\nextremely limited and imperfect.\r\n\r\nORIBASIUS[125] recommends in high terms certain combinations of\r\n_Evacuant_ and _Roborant_ medicines, and the remarks of ALEXANDER\r\nTRALLIANUS on a remedy which he exhibited in paralysis, serve to shew\r\nthat he was well acquainted with the fact, that certain substances lose\r\ntheir efficacy when they stimulate the bowels to excess, for he cautions\r\nus against adding a greater proportion of _Scammony_ to it; many, he\r\nobserves, think that by so doing, they increase the force of the\r\nmedicine, whereas in fact they make it _useless_, by carrying it\r\nimmediately through the bowels, instead of suffering it to remain and be\r\nconveyed to the remote parts.\r\n\r\nIn modern Europe, the same attachment to luxuriancy of composition has\r\nbeen transmitted to our own times: there are several prescriptions of\r\nHuxham extant, which contain more than _four hundred_ ingredients. I\r\nhave already observed that all extravagant systems tend, in the course\r\nof time, to introduce practices of an opposite kind; this truth finds\r\nanother powerful illustration in the history of medicinal combination,\r\nand it becomes a serious question, which it will be my duty to discuss,\r\nwhether the disgust so justly excited by the _poly-pharmacy_ of our\r\npredecessors, may not have induced the physician of the present day to\r\ncarry his ideas of simplicity _too far_, so as to neglect and lose the\r\nadvantages which in many cases beyond all doubt may be obtained by\r\nscientific combinations. “To those,” says Sir A. Crichton, “who think\r\nthat the Science of Medicine is improved by an affected simplicity in\r\nprescribing, I would remark, that modern pharmacopœias are shorn so much\r\nof old and approved receipts,[126] on account of their being\r\nextraordinary compounds, so as to be almost useless in some cases.”\r\n\r\nIn the year 1799, Dr. FORDYCE, in a valuable paper published in the\r\nsecond volume of the Transactions of the Medical Society, investigated\r\nthis subject with much perspicuity and success: unfortunately, however,\r\nthis memoir terminates with the investigation of _similar_ remedies,\r\nthat is to say, of those which produce upon the body similar effects,\r\nand he is entirely silent upon the advantages which may be obtained by\r\nthe combination of those medicines which possess _different_, or even\r\n_opposite_ qualities; it must be also remembered that at the time this\r\nmemoir was composed by its eminent author, Chemistry had scarcely\r\nextended its illuminating rays into the recesses of physic. Under such\r\ncircumstances, I am induced to undertake the arduous task of inquiring\r\ninto the several relations in which each article of a compound formula\r\nmay be advantageously situated with respect to the others; and I am\r\nfarther encouraged in this investigation, by a conviction of its\r\npractical importance, as well as by feeling that it has hitherto never\r\nreceived the share of attention which it merits. “I think,” says Dr.\r\nPowell, “it may be asserted, without fear of contradiction, that no\r\nmedicine compounded of five or six simple articles, has hitherto had its\r\npowers examined in a rational manner.” If this attempt should be the\r\nmeans of directing the attention of future practitioners to the subject,\r\nand thereby of rendering the Art of Composition more efficient, by\r\nplacing it upon the permanent basis of science, I shall feel that I have\r\nprofitably devoted my time and attention to the most useful of all\r\nmedical subjects. “_Res est maximi momenti in arte medendi, cum, Formula\r\nin se considerata, possit esse profecto mortis vel vitæ sententia._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n PHARMACOLOGIA.|| ON THE| OPERATIONS OF MEDICINAL BODIES,| AND ON THE|\r\n                    CLASSIFICATIONS FOUNDED ON THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Medicos tandem tædet et pudet, diutius garrire de Remediis,\r\n  Specificis, et Alexipharmicis, et cæteris, nisi eorum naturam et\r\n  modum quo prosint, quodammodo ostendere et explanare possint._”\r\n\r\n                                                 CONSPECT.

Under certain limitations we may perhaps\r\nventure to assent to this general proposition; but it cannot be too\r\nforcibly or too frequently impressed upon the mind of the medical\r\npractitioner, that _Medicines are frequently but relative agents_,\r\nproducing their effects in reference only to the state of the living\r\nframe; we must therefore concur with Sir Gilbert Blane in stating, that\r\nthe virtues of Medicines cannot be fairly essayed, nor beneficially\r\nascertained, by trying their effects on sound subjects, because that\r\nparticular morbid condition does not exist which they may be exclusively\r\ncalculated to remove;[127] thus in certain states of debility, _Tonics_\r\nmay excite the system when languid, by their sympathetic influence upon\r\nthe _primæ viæ_, while in a robust condition of the body, the effects of\r\nthe same agents may be wholly inappreciable.\r\n\r\nThe MODUS OPERANDI of remedies, or the general principle upon which they\r\neffect salutary changes in the morbid states of the body, is involved in\r\nconsiderable obscurity, and has given rise to much ingenious speculation\r\nand scientific controversy. It would seem that the immediate impression\r\nof a remedy may depend upon mechanical, chemical, or vital agencies; and\r\nthat the sanative impulse thus occasioned may either be Absolute, or\r\nRelative;—Primary, or Secondary;—Local, or General;—Direct, or\r\nSympathetic;—Permanent, or Transient;—thus certain purgatives will\r\noccasion intestinal excretions in every condition of the body, and may\r\ntherefore be justly considered as _absolute_ agents; while diuretics,\r\nsince they generally require for their success, a certain state of the\r\nliving system, may with equal truth be denominated _relative_ in their\r\noperation. That the obvious effect of a remedy may either depend upon\r\nits _Primary_, or upon its _Secondary_ and incidental operation, will at\r\nonce be apparent by inspecting the diagram which exhibits the\r\nclassification of diuretic medicines; the same scheme will also shew\r\nthat remedies may be _local_ or _general_ in their effects, and may\r\nexcite an action in distant organs, either by entering the circulating\r\nmass, and being thus brought into contact with their textures;—by\r\noccasioning an impulse conveyed through the nervous system,—or by\r\nexciting a local impression upon the stomach and _primæ viæ_, and thus\r\narousing their energies through the mysterious medium of\r\nsympathetic[128] communication.\r\n\r\nThat certain bodies are capable of evading the assimilating functions,\r\nand of entering, unchanged, into the circulating current, either through\r\nthe branches of the thoracic duct, or of the _vena portarum_, is a fact\r\nwhich admits of chemical demonstration; many of the alkaline salts are\r\nthus conveyed to the kidneys, and being excreted from the blood by its\r\nvessels, are to be easily detected in the urine by appropriate reagents;\r\nI have made many experiments upon this subject, and am prepared to state\r\nsome results which may perhaps explain the occasional value of such\r\nbodies as medicines. Some essential oils, particular _bitter_\r\nprinciples,[129] and certain colouring matter,[130] seem also capable of\r\npassing the barriers of digestion, and of circulating to the remote\r\nparts of the body; Mercury, and several of the other metals, would\r\nlikewise appear, under certain circumstances, to possess a similar\r\nprivilege, and the former to be able moreover to facilitate the\r\nabsorption of other bodies with which it may be associated, as I shall\r\nhereafter more fully exemplify.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, the medicinal body undergoes a partial decomposition\r\nby the digestive organs, _in transitu_, by which some of its\r\nconstituents escape into the circulation, while the others are\r\ncompletely digested, and converted into chyle; this occurs with saline\r\ncompounds into which vegetable acids enter as constituents. See _Potassæ\r\nAcetas_. It is also stated in the history of Diluents, that there is\r\nreason to believe that _Water_ may under particular circumstances suffer\r\ndecomposition, and transfer its elements for the formation of new\r\ncompounds, furnishing _oxygen_ to some, and _hydrogen_ to others. There\r\nis likewise reason to suppose, that in particular conditions of the\r\ndigestive functions, a remedy may be at once rendered inert by its\r\nentire decomposition.[131]\r\n\r\nThat an impression made upon the stomach by a medicinal agent, should be\r\nthe means of exciting an action in the distant parts of the machine,\r\nwill not appear extraordinary when we consider how universal a sympathy\r\nand control this central organ exercises over every function of the\r\nbody; imbued with exquisite and diversified sensibilities,—subjected to\r\nthe first and coarsest impressions of our various ingesta,—stretched\r\noccasionally to an enormous extent by the unrestricted indulgence of\r\nappetite,—disturbed by the passions,—exhausted by volition, and\r\ndebilitated by intense thinking; in short, assailed by numerous foes\r\nfrom _without_, and harassed by various revolutions from _within_, can\r\nwe feel surprised that the aberrations of this viscus should give origin\r\nto the greater number of maladies with which we are afflicted, or that\r\nthose medicinal applications should be effective that are directed for\r\ntheir cure, through the medium of its sympathies?\r\n\r\nA dose of Ipecacuan, by exciting the stomach, will abate both the force\r\nand velocity of the heart in its vital motion, and affect the whole\r\nseries of blood vessels, from their origin to their most minute\r\nramifications, as is evinced by the pallor of the skin under its\r\noperation, as well as by its efficacy in arresting hemorrhage; so the\r\nbrain, when disordered by vertigo, frequently derives instantaneous\r\nrelief from the administration of a tea-spoonful of æther in a glass of\r\nwater. The stomach however is not in every case the medium of sympathy;\r\na substance may excite a powerful impression upon a distant part, by the\r\ninstrumentality of the nerves, without any concurrence of the stomach;\r\nthus, the _Belladonna_, by coming in contact with the _Tunica\r\nConjunctiva_ of the eye, will occasion immediate dilatation of the\r\n_Iris_, although no other part of the system is in the slightest degree\r\naffected.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another mode by which remedies may be made to exert a\r\nsanative effect upon particular organs of the body, through the medium\r\nof what Mr. Hunter called _contiguous_ sympathy, and whose existence\r\nappears to depend upon the mere proximity and contiguity of parts,\r\nwithout any relation to the distribution of the nerves; thus it is, that\r\nrelief is afforded to a deep-seated inflammation, by scarifying the\r\nnearest external surface; while we know from long experience that the\r\nthoracic or abdominal viscera, when similarly affected, receive\r\ncorresponding relief from the same topical use of bleeding, blistering,\r\nor fomenting.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to the _Modus Operandi_ of medicines the following\r\nclassification may be established.\r\n\r\n  THE PARTICULAR ORGANS OF THE BODY MAY BE EXCITED INTO ACTION, THROUGH\r\n           FOUR DISTINCT AND DIFFERENT MODES OF COMMUNICATION.\r\n\r\n   I. _By the actual contact of the appropriate remedy._\r\n\r\n      1. _Conveyed by absorption_, WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION.\r\n\r\n         _Internally._│_a._ _through the branches of the Thoracic duct_.\r\n               „      │_b._ _through the branches of the Vena\r\n                      │       Portarum_.[132]\r\n\r\n         _Externally._│_c._ _through the branches of divided\r\n                      │       blood-vessels_.\r\n               „      │_d._ _through the branches of Lymphatics_.[133]\r\n\r\n      2. _Conveyed by absorption_, WITH DECOMPOSITION, _by which one or\r\n           more of its constituents are developed, and pass into the\r\n           circulating current_.\r\n\r\n  II. _By an impulse conveyed through the instrumentality of the\r\n        nerves._\r\n\r\n III. _By the sympathetic control exerted by the stomach on distant\r\n        parts._\r\n\r\n  IV. _By the operation of contiguous sympathy, or of that which is\r\n        excited by the mere proximity and continuity of parts._\r\n\r\nAnd it is important to observe, that these are frequently antagonist\r\noperations, and consequently, that remedies, although they should\r\noccasion the same apparent effects, unless they act through the same\r\nmedium, are not SIMILAR agents, but on the contrary, are generally\r\nmedicinally incompatible with each other; for an illustration of this\r\ntruth, the practitioner may refer to the observations which I have\r\noffered under the history of diuretics.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of justly appreciating these phenomena, in every\r\ninstance, has furnished a powerful objection against the validity of any\r\nclassification of medicinal substances which is founded on their\r\nsupposed modes of operation; and it must be acknowledged that, if we are\r\nunable to assign to remedies their primary action, or to distinguish\r\nthis from their more obvious, though perhaps secondary effects, we shall\r\nfrequently be compelled to place similar medicines under opposite heads,\r\nand to include those of very dissimilar characters under the same\r\nartificial division; an error which has contributed more generally to\r\nembarrass and misguide our practice than any other therapeutical\r\nfallacy, and it was the conviction of this truth which induced me to\r\nintroduce the present chapter, and to impress the importance of its\r\nsubject upon the attention of my practical readers.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that, in philosophical strictness, no two medicines in\r\nour Materia Medica are perfectly similar, although they recede from each\r\nother by such insensible shades of gradation that we may with practical\r\nadvantage admit their parallelism; at the same time, it must be ever\r\nkept in remembrance, that _those Medicines only are practically similar,\r\nwhose operations have been found by experience to continue similar under\r\nevery condition of the human body; and which, moreover, owe such\r\nsimilarity to modes of operation which are compatible with each other,\r\nand consonant with the general indications of cure_.\r\n\r\nThe importance of admitting this proposition will be frequently\r\nillustrated in the sequel; and it may be observed in this place, that\r\nevery classification in which it is not recognised as a leading\r\nprinciple, must be as imperfect in its execution, as it will be unjust\r\nand erroneous in its views.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to any farther discussion upon the present subject, it\r\nwill be necessary to offer a synoptical view of an arrangement of\r\nmedicinal bodies founded upon the basis of their operations, in order\r\nthat I may be better enabled to illustrate the observations which it is\r\nmy intention to introduce: for this purpose I shall present the reader\r\nwith three different classifications of this kind; the first being that\r\nproposed by Dr. Cullen,[134] and which is now admitted to rest on\r\nprinciples nearly altogether false, but the investigation of which will\r\nafford many useful lessons of practical importance; the second\r\nclassification is by Dr. Young;[135] and the third is that proposed by\r\nDr. Murray,[136] which, from its simplicity and strict conformity with\r\nthe views I intend to offer, will be adopted as being the most eligible\r\nfor the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n              CULLEN’S ARRANGEMENT OF THE MATERIA MEDICA.\r\n\r\n                          Medicamenta agunt in\r\n\r\n             SOLIDA. │SIMPLICIA.\r\n                „    │       _Astringentia._\r\n                „    │       _Tonica._\r\n                „    │       _Emollientia._\r\n                „    │       _Erodentia._\r\n                „    │\r\n                „    │VIVA.\r\n                „    │       _Stimulantia._\r\n                „    │       _Sedantia._\r\n                „    │              _Narcotica._\r\n                „    │              _Refrigerantia._\r\n                „    │       _Antispasmodica._\r\n\r\n             FLUIDA. │IMMUTANTIA.\r\n                „    │       Fluiditatem.\r\n                „    │              _Attenuantia._\r\n                „    │              _Inspissantia._\r\n                „    │       Misturam.\r\n                „    │       Acrimoniam Corrigentia.\r\n                „    │              _In Genere._\r\n                „    │                     _Demulcentia._\r\n                „    │              _In Specie._\r\n                „    │                     _Ant-acida._\r\n                „    │                     _Ant-alkalina._\r\n                „    │                     _Antiseptica._\r\n                „    │\r\n                „    │EVACUANTIA.\r\n                „    │       _Errhina._\r\n                „    │       _Sialogoga._\r\n                „    │       _Expectorantia._\r\n                „    │       _Emetica._\r\n                „    │       _Cathartica._\r\n                „    │       _Diuretica._\r\n                „    │       _Diaphoretica._\r\n                „    │       _Menagoga._\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CLASSIFICATION OF THE MATERIA MEDICA\r\n                             BY DR.

With the exception of a very few substances, it is now\r\ngenerally admitted that medicines produce their effects by acting on the\r\nliving materials of which our organs are composed, and not by modifying\r\nthe specific gravity, or chemical composition, of the fluids which they\r\nmay happen to evacuate. The origin of this latter opinion is to be\r\ntraced to the exploded notions of the humoral pathologists, and to the\r\nexclusive doctrine of the earlier chemists; for as the former recognised\r\na depraved condition of the fluids as the source of every disease, so\r\ndid the latter imagine that every remedy operated by producing a\r\nchemical change upon its composition; and the remedial value of a\r\nmedicinal substance was estimated by its effects upon inert matter. Thus\r\nwere experiments made with different substances upon the blood, and\r\nother fluids of the body, in order to deduce, from the results, the\r\nnature and extent of their powers as agents upon the living frame; for\r\ninstance, the _spirit_ and _salt of hartshorn_, as they were found to\r\nrender the blood more fluid, when added to it, _out of the body_, were\r\nindiscriminately administered in almost every complaint, with a view to\r\ndissolve that “lentor of the fluids” which was regarded as the more\r\ngeneral source of disease. For similar reasons, a tribe of medicines\r\nwere introduced into practice under the title of _Antiseptics_, for the\r\nprevention of a process which very probably never takes place in the\r\nliving body: the powers of these supposed agents were, as usual,\r\ninferred from their effects in resisting and preventing the putrefaction\r\nof dead matter.\r\n\r\nNor is the distinction assumed by Dr. Cullen, between the action of\r\nremedies on the _Simple_ and _Living_ solids less hypothetical. Tonics\r\nand astringents may certainly exert a beneficial effect upon the animal\r\nfibre, but not by any immediate action on its materials, but through the\r\nagency of its living principle.—“_Medicamentum non agit in cadaver._”\r\n\r\nThe classification of Dr. Young, although it presents many points of\r\ninterest and value, is not altogether free from objection; his classes\r\nin some instances are perhaps unnecessarily sub-divided, without a\r\nsufficient regard to the primary and secondary operations of the\r\nsubstances which they include. The arrangement of Murray has been\r\nadopted in the present inquiry, not as being less objectionable, in a\r\ngeneral point of view, but as one which from its simplicity, is better\r\ncalculated, as a frame-work, if I may so express myself, for the display\r\nof those particular facts, the knowledge of which I consider essential\r\nfor the successful administration of medicinal agents, and for the full\r\ncomprehension of those practical doctrines which it is the exclusive\r\nobject of this work to inculcate.\r\n\r\nDr. Murray observes that, in this arrangement, he places in the first\r\ndivision those substances which exert a GENERAL STIMULANT operation on\r\nthe system. Of this there are two sub-divisions, the DIFFUSIBLE and the\r\nPERMANENT; the former including the class of _Narcotics_, with which may\r\nbe associated, as not very remote in their operation, the class of\r\n_Antispasmodics_; the latter comprising two classes, viz. _Tonics and\r\nAstringents_. Through these there is a gradual transition from the most\r\nhighly diffusible stimulant, to those most slow and durable in their\r\naction.\r\n\r\nA second division comprehends LOCAL STIMULANTS, those, the action of\r\nwhich is determined to particular parts of the system. Such are the\r\nclasses of _Emetics_, _Cathartics_, _Emmenagogues_, _Diuretics_,\r\n_Diaphoretics_, _Expectorants_, and _Sialogogues_; with which may be\r\nassociated the classes of _Errhines_ and of _Epispastics_, founded on\r\ndirect local application.\r\n\r\nThe remaining classes include substances which do not operate according\r\nto laws peculiar to the living system. To one division may be referred\r\nthose, whose effects depend on the CHEMICAL changes they produce in the\r\nfluids or solids; the classes which may be established on this principle\r\nare _Refrigerants_, _Antacids_, _Lithonthriptics_, and _Escharotics_. To\r\nanother division belong those, the operation of which is purely\r\nMECHANICAL, as _Anthelmintics_, _Demulcents_, _Diluents_, _Emollients_,\r\nand certain _Laxatives_.\r\n\r\nUnder the above classes, says Dr. Murray,[137] may be comprehended all\r\nthose substances which are capable of producing salutary changes in the\r\nhuman system, and which are used as remedies. I have stated my reasons\r\nfor adopting this as a general basis of classification, although I shall\r\ndeviate very considerably in the subordinate divisions of the plan, in\r\nthe hope of establishing some distinctions that may tend to practical\r\nutility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1. GENERAL STIMULANTS.\r\n\r\nThe four classes comprehended under this first division, are NARCOTICS,\r\nANTISPASMODICS, TONICS, and ASTRINGENTS.\r\n\r\nAlthough these remedies differ very essentially in the degree and\r\npermanence of their action, as well as in the character of their\r\napparent effects, yet, as it is conceived that their _primary_ operation\r\nis stimulant, they are considered as possessing sufficient general\r\nsimilitude to sanction their arrangement under one comprehensive\r\ndivision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NARCOTICS.\r\n\r\n       Synon: _Sedatives._ _Anodynes._ _Hypnotics._ _Soporifics._\r\n\r\nSubstances which, in a moderate dose, occasion a temporary increase of\r\nthe actions of the nervous and vascular systems, but which is followed\r\nby a greater depression of the vital powers than is commensurate with\r\nthe degree of previous excitement, and which is generally followed by\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe relative intensity of these primary and secondary effects varies in\r\nthe different narcotics,[138] and even in the same narcotic in different\r\ndoses; in some cases, especially if the quantity administered be\r\nconsiderable, the symptoms of diminished sense and action follow so\r\nimmediately, that the previous stage of increased action is very\r\nobscure, or not in the least perceptible, while in other cases, the\r\noperation of the substance is more particularly directed towards the\r\nheart and arteries, and syncope succeeds its exhibition. These facts\r\nhave led many physiologists to deny the stimulant nature of these\r\nbodies, and to consider their primary operation as one of a depressing\r\nkind, whence they have bestowed upon them the name of SEDATIVES; in\r\nreferring to the classification of Cullen and Young, we shall find that\r\nthe arrangement of these substances has been directed in strict\r\nconformity with such a view of the subject; but it may be asked, how the\r\nincreased excitement and exhilaration which so obviously follow the use\r\nof these bodies, in small doses, can be reconciled with that theory\r\nwhich considers them as absolutely and primarily sedative? In order to\r\ncombat an argument so fatal to his hypothesis, Dr. Cullen summons to his\r\naid the potent intercession of his tutelar deity, the _Vis Medicatrix_,\r\na power which he supposes to preside over our living body, and with\r\nanxious vigilance, to resist the invasion of every thing that is\r\nnoxious, or hostile to its health and well being; with such assistance\r\nit was not difficult to explain any paradox in physiology, and the\r\nanomalies attending the agency of narcotic medicines were accordingly,\r\nin the school of Cullen, easily reconciled with the views of a favourite\r\ntheory. He supposed that whenever a _sedative_ was applied in a moderate\r\ndose, the _Vis Medicatrix_ took the alarm, and excited all the powers of\r\nthe system, in order to throw off the noxious application, and that thus\r\n_indirectly_ arose those peculiar symptoms of increased action; but when\r\nthe dose was more considerable, he contended that the preserving power\r\nof the system was silenced, and unable to offer any salutary resistance,\r\nand consequently that universal depression immediately followed; but\r\nthere is no direct evidence in support of the existence of such a power,\r\nand still less of its influence upon such occasions; it is far more\r\nphilosophical to refer the operation of narcotics to a peculiar\r\nstimulating power, remarkable for the extreme rapidity with which it\r\nexhausts the energy of the nervous system. No one will deny the\r\nstimulating powers of alcohol, and yet a very large draught of this\r\nliquor will occasion extreme exhaustion without the occurrence of any\r\nsigns of previous excitement; nor will any one be disposed to question\r\nthe depressing influence of opium, and yet small doses have enkindled\r\nexcitement and sustained the powers of life, under circumstances of\r\nextreme and alarming exhaustion.[139]\r\n\r\nFrom the celerity with which narcotics produce their effects, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that they act upon the nervous system through the\r\nsympathetic relations of the stomach, although in some instances it is\r\nhighly probable that these bodies are actually absorbed into the\r\ncirculation; I am inclined to think that this occurs with opium, as\r\ndeath is accelerated in cases of persons poisoned by it, by the adoption\r\nof those measures which are best calculated to promote its absorption:\r\n(_see Opium_.) A still more striking proof is furnished by the fact of\r\nopium, when externally applied to ulcers, producing all its\r\nconstitutional effects, such as costiveness, head-ache, nausea, &c.\r\nWhether the effects of spirituous potations are to be attributed to the\r\nintroduction of alcohol into the blood, or to the sympathies existing\r\nbetween the stomach and brain, is still a question of doubt. Dr.\r\nCooke[140] relates a case, on the authority of Sir A. Carlisle, of a\r\nperson who was brought dead into the Westminster Hospital, in\r\nconsequence of having drank a quart of gin for a wager, and that upon\r\nexamination, a considerable quantity of a limpid fluid was found within\r\nthe lateral ventricles of the brain, _distinctly impregnated with gin_.\r\nI very well remember the case, for it occurred during the period that I\r\nheld the situation of Physician to that hospital, but it is very\r\ndoubtful whether such an absorption occurs under ordinary circumstances.\r\nWe well know the facility with which certain odorous bodies enter the\r\ncirculation, and are developed in distant organs; it is therefore very\r\npossible that the apparent odour of the gin, which has been sometimes\r\nrecognized in the secretions, may depend upon the presence of the\r\nflavouring ingredients, independent of the alcohol?\r\n\r\nAt one period, substances supposed to possess narcotic virtues were\r\nplaced about the bed to obviate watchfulness; the plant _Anethum_, or\r\n_Dill_, was very commonly suspended over the head for such a purpose,\r\nwhile in modern times the _Hop_ has been introduced into the pillow.\r\n\r\nIn concluding the history of Narcotics, it may be observed, that there\r\nis, perhaps, no class of medicinal bodies, the individuals of which are\r\nless disposed to bend and conform to an artificial arrangement; each\r\nwould seem to have its own particular mode of operation, and to affect\r\nsensibility in its own peculiar manner; and hence the practitioner will\r\noften find that, after the failure of one narcotic, the administration\r\nof another will induce sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ANTISPASMODICS.\r\n\r\nSubstances which have the power of allaying the inordinate action of\r\nmuscular structures, and of assuaging pain, without occasioning that\r\nstate of insensibility which characterises the operation of narcotics.\r\n\r\nThere are certain medicinal bodies which would appear to exert a\r\nspecific control over spasmodic action, from whatever cause it may have\r\noriginated, such are _Assafœtida_, _Galbanum_, _Musk_, _Castor_,\r\n_Ammonia_, _Valerian_, _&c._ To such remedies the term antispasmodic\r\nmore exclusively belongs, but in a more general view of the subject we\r\nmust admit that this class branches, by indefinable gradations, into\r\nnarcotics and tonics; for since spasm may be connected with the most\r\nopposite states of the body, it is very evident that many of the\r\nindividuals included in the class of antispasmodics, can only be\r\nrelative agents: spasm, for instance, may arise from excessive\r\nirritability, as from teething, wounds, worms, &c. in which case a\r\nnarcotic would prove beneficial; or it may depend upon a state of\r\ngeneral debility, the proper remedy for which would be the\r\nadministration of an Aromatic Stimulant, or the assiduous exhibition of\r\nsome permanent tonic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TONICS.\r\n\r\nSubstances, whose continued administration gives strength and vigour to\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nIt is very justly admitted, that a state of permanent tension in the\r\nfibres of the body is necessary for the existence of life, and that any\r\nundue departure from such a condition is followed by debility. Thus, Sir\r\nGilbert Blane observes, that no muscle, whether voluntary or\r\ninvoluntary, can act unless its fibres are previously in such a state,\r\nthat if divided they would shrink by their own resiliency, leaving an\r\ninterval between the cut extremities; the same may be said of the\r\nvascular system in all its ramifications, in order to give play to their\r\ncontraction in grasping and propelling their contained fluids. It\r\nappears that there are certain medicinal bodies that have the power of\r\naffecting this state of tension, and when their effects contribute to\r\nits restoration, they are properly denominated _Tonics_. We are not,\r\nhowever, to consider them as producing such a change by any mechanical\r\noperation upon the matter of which the fibre is composed, but by a\r\ndirect action upon its living principle; it seems probable that certain\r\npoisons may thus produce sudden death by their agency on the vital\r\nprinciple, by which the tension of the heart and whole arterial system\r\nis immediately relaxed. In this point of view, _Tonics_, like the other\r\nremedies which we have described, may be _relative_ or _absolute_ in\r\ntheir operation. Venesection, purgation, or whatever will, under certain\r\nconditions of the body, occasion a salutary change in its vital powers,\r\nmay produce a corresponding alteration in the tension of its fibres, and\r\nconsequently fall under the denomination of a tonic remedy: but\r\nindependent of the state of the body, there would seem to be certain\r\nsubstances that act as specific stimuli upon the living fibre, and are\r\nin certain cases indispensable for the maintenance of its healthy tone;\r\nsuch are vegetable bitters, which produce a powerful effect upon the\r\ndigestive organs, and by nervous sympathy, upon the rest of the system.\r\n_Bitter Extractive_,[141] seems to be as essential to the digestion of\r\nherbivorous, as salt is to that of carnivorous animals; it acts as a\r\nnatural stimulant, for it has been shewn by a variety of experiments\r\nthat it passes through the body without suffering any diminution in its\r\nquantity, or change in its nature. No cattle will thrive upon grasses\r\nwhich do not contain a portion of this vegetable principle; this fact\r\nhas been most satisfactorily proved by the late researches of Mr.\r\nSinclair, gardener to the Duke of Bedford, which are recorded in that\r\nmagnificent work, the “HORTUS GRAMINEUS WOBURNENSIS.” They shew, that if\r\nsheep are fed on _Yellow Turnips_, which contain little or no bitter\r\nprinciple, they instinctively seek for, and greedily devour any\r\nprovender which may contain it, and if they cannot so obtain it they\r\nbecome diseased and die. We are ourselves conscious of the invigorating\r\neffects of slight bitters upon our stomach; and their presence in malt\r\nliquors not only tends to diminish the noxious effects of such\r\npotations, by counteracting the indirect debility which they are liable\r\nto occasion, but even to render them, when taken in moderation,\r\npromoters of digestion. The custom of infusing bitter herbs in vinous\r\ndrinks is very ancient and universal; the _Poculum Absinthiatum_ was\r\nregarded in remote ages as a wholesome beverage, and the Wormwood was\r\nsupposed to act as an antidote against drunkenness. The Swiss peasant\r\ncheers himself amidst the frigid solitude of his glaciers, with a spirit\r\ndistilled from _Gentian_, the extreme bitterness of which is relished\r\nwith a glee that is quite unintelligible to a more cultivated taste.\r\nWith regard to the natural use of _Bitter Extractive_, it may be laid\r\ndown as a truth, that it stimulates the stomach,—corrects putrefying and\r\nunwholesome nutriment,—promotes tardy digestion,—increases the nutritive\r\npowers of those vegetable substances to which it is united,—and\r\nfurnishes a natural remedy for the deranged functions of the stomach in\r\nparticular, and through the sympathetic medium of that organ, for the\r\natony of remote parts in general; and I shall hereafter shew, that in\r\nits medicinal applications it certainly imparts additional activity to\r\nmany remedies, while it renders the stomach and system more susceptible\r\nof their salutary energies. As an essential ingredient in the provender\r\nof herbivorous animals, it may I think be admitted as a fact, that its\r\nimportance is _in an inverse ratio_ with the nutritive powers[142] of\r\nthe food, and we accordingly find, in conformity with that universal\r\nscheme of self-adjustment and compensation, which influences all the\r\noperations of nature, that cultivation, which extends the nutritive\r\npowers of vegetable bodies, generally diminishes their bitterness in the\r\nsame proportion; the natural history of the Potatoe offers a good\r\nillustration of this fact, for the roots of this useful plant which have\r\nbeen so greatly improved by culture, are in their wild state both small\r\nand _bitter_.[143] Gummy matter, which seems to result from the first\r\nchange of the sap, is undoubtedly rendered more digestible and nutritive\r\nby the presence of a _bitter_; pure gum is not very much disposed to\r\nyield to the assimilative functions; “it frequently passes through the\r\nbowels,” says Dr. Chapman,[144] “very little changed, as I have\r\nwitnessed a thousand times.” We see therefore the value of the bitter\r\nprinciple, in the economy of the _Lichen Islandicus_, which is intended\r\nas the food of animals in northern latitudes; we are told that boiled\r\nlinseed constituted the sole diet of the people of Zealand during a\r\nscarcity of long continuance, on which occasion, symptoms of great\r\ndebility occurred, attended with those of dyspepsia; so again Professor\r\nFritze, in his Medical Annals, states that vegetable mucilage, when used\r\nas a principal article of diet, relaxes the organs of digestion, and\r\nproduces a viscid slimy mucus, and a morbid action in the primæ viæ, an\r\neffect which analogy shews might be obviated by the addition of bitter\r\nextractive. For the same reason animals that feed in marshy lands, on\r\nfood containing but little nourishment, are best defended from the\r\ndiseases they are liable to contract in such situations by the ingestion\r\nof bitter plants.[145] Upon these occasions nature is very kind, for the\r\nparticular situation that engenders endemic diseases is generally\r\ncongenial to the growth of the plants that operate as antidotes to them.\r\n\r\nI have offered these views upon the subject of _Bitter Extractive_, from\r\na conviction that they will essentially contribute to the establishing\r\nof just and philosophical notions, respecting the necessity and _modus\r\noperandi_ of many vegetable tonics.\r\n\r\nAs the action of tonics is gradual, so their operation is not followed\r\nby that exhaustion consequent upon the use of diffusible stimulants.\r\n\r\nThe substances which compose the class of tonics are derived from the\r\nvegetable and mineral kingdoms; those of the former are generally\r\nbitter, and produce their effects by a primary action on the stomach,\r\nand are not absorbed into the circulation, as experiments upon _Bitter\r\nExtractive_ have most fully demonstrated; those derived from the mineral\r\nkingdom, comprehending several of the metals, appear in some instances\r\nto pass into the circulation, although several of them, like the\r\nvegetable tonics, act primarily on the _primæ viæ_; I apprehend this\r\nobservation applies to the _nitrate of silver_, which certainly\r\npossesses considerable powers as a tonic in certain cases of dyspepsia,\r\nfor which it may perhaps be indebted to the bitterness which\r\ndistinguishes it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               AROMATICS.\r\n\r\nSubstances of a fragrant smell,[146] which produce upon the organs of\r\ntaste a peculiar sensation of warmth and pungency, and occasion, when\r\nswallowed, a corresponding impulse upon the stomach, which is rapidly\r\ncommunicated to the remote parts of the body.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable bodies which constitute the class of aromatic stimulants\r\nare very intimately related with that of tonics; indeed in the most\r\nefficient vegetables of the latter kind, the two qualities are generally\r\nblended, and the transition from these to the more pure bitters and\r\naromatics is so imperceptible, that it is extremely difficult to arrange\r\nthem in different classes; Dr. Murray has accordingly in his\r\nclassification not attempted to separate substances which are so\r\nintimately connected. _Aromatic Stimulants_, however, in a practical\r\npoint of view, must be distinguished from tonics, as the former are\r\nvaluable for the _rapidity_, the latter, for the _permanency_ of their\r\neffects. Their characteristic properties appear to depend chiefly, if\r\nnot entirely, on an essential oil which, when extracted from the\r\nvegetable, exhibits all its aromatic power in a very concentrated form.\r\n\r\nMedicines of this kind, when administered for the purpose of dispelling\r\nwind from the alimentary canal, have been termed _Carminatives_.[147]\r\nThey would seem to act by imparting energy to the distended and weakened\r\nmuscular coat of the stomach, by which the accumulated _gas_ is\r\npropelled through the upper orifice; for this viscus, like the bladder,\r\nwhen greatly distended, becomes unable to relieve itself, partly in\r\nconsequence of the exhausted state of the over-stretched fibres of its\r\nmuscular coat, and partly perhaps from a contraction of the _Cardia_, or\r\nupper orifice; for it has been already stated that a loss of power, and\r\nspasmodic action, are often the simultaneous results of debility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              ASTRINGENTS.\r\n\r\nSubstances which, when applied to the human body, corrugate and condense\r\nits fibres, and at the same time, exert a tonic influence through the\r\nmedium of its living principle.\r\n\r\nAstringency in any substance may be at once recognised by the organs of\r\ntaste; its power in corrugating the papillæ of the tongue, and in\r\nimparting a sensation of harshness and roughness to the palate, being\r\ntoo peculiar to be mistaken; this is a fortunate circumstance, for there\r\ndoes not exist any one chemical test by which we can invariably detect\r\nthe property of astringency, since it is found to reside in many\r\ndifferent classes of substances: thus, acids, especially the stronger\r\nmineral ones, are powerfully astringent; so are many of the metallic\r\nsalts, as those of iron, zinc, copper, and lead; and some of the earths,\r\nwhen combined with acids, of which alum is a striking example. The\r\nvegetable kingdom, however, furnishes the greater number of astringent\r\nremedies; and chemistry has shewn that this property uniformly depends\r\nupon a peculiar proximate principle, characterized by its power of\r\nforming an insoluble compound with animal gelatine; to this principle\r\nthe name of TANNIN has been given. As tannin generally exists in union\r\nwith gallic acid, and as the latter body is known by its property of\r\nstriking an inky blackness with the salts of iron, solutions of this\r\nmetal were long, but erroneously, regarded as the proper test of\r\nvegetable astringency; the fallacy of this is at once shewn by the\r\nhabitudes of Catechu, one of the strongest of our astringents, but\r\nwhich, nevertheless, will not yield the smallest degree of blackness to\r\nthe solutions of iron, because it contains only tannin, the true\r\nprinciple of astringency, without a trace of its usual associate the\r\ngallic acid. From the power which these substances possess of\r\nastringing, and condensing the animal solids, their medicinal properties\r\nare supposed to arise, and we may perhaps, in this instance, admit such\r\na mechanical explanation; but astringents possess also some power over\r\nthe living principle of the matter which they astringe, for they are\r\ncapable of acting as permanent stimulants, of curing intermitting fever,\r\nand of obviating states of general debility. Astringents would seem to\r\nmoderate the morbidly increased secretions of distant parts, and to\r\nrestrain hemorrhage, by their corrugating influence upon the _primæ\r\nviæ_,[148] which is extended by sympathetic action to the vascular\r\nfibre; it is not difficult for any person to conceive the possibility of\r\nsuch a sympathy, who has ever experienced the thrilling and singular\r\nfeeling which is produced over the whole body, by the _acerb_ taste of\r\nthe sloe-juice. As however the primary operation of these bodies, by\r\ntheir actual contact with the animal fibre, must be much more powerful\r\nthan that which can result from the mere sympathy of parts, we find that\r\nthe efficacy of astringents is principally displayed in the cure of\r\ndiarrhœa, or serous evacuations from the intestinal canal; their\r\noperation, in checking profuse fluor albus, gleet, and the inordinate\r\nsecretions of other distant organs, is much less striking and\r\nunequivocal, and it is a question whether in many of such cases the\r\nbenefit arising from their use may not depend upon their tonic powers.\r\nAs the morbid excess of different evacuations may arise from various and\r\nopposite states of the living system, so may the individuals of the\r\nother classes become astringents; and we are bound to admit upon this,\r\nas we have on other occasions, the existence of _absolute_ and\r\n_relative_ remedies.\r\n\r\nNarcotics, at the head of which stands opium, will frequently assume the\r\ncharacter of astringents, by diminishing the irritability upon which\r\nincreased discharges depend. In Diarrhœa, an astringent, properly so\r\ncalled, diminishes the flow of those acrid fluids into the intestines,\r\nby which their peristaltic motions are præternaturally increased, and it\r\nconsequently represses the diarrhœa; a narcotic, under similar\r\ncircumstances, might not repress the flow of the acrid matter to which I\r\nhave alluded, but it would render the bowels less susceptible to its\r\nstimulus, and would therefore produce the same apparent alleviation,\r\nalthough by a very different mode of operation. There is yet a third\r\nspecies of remedy, which may operate in restraining a diarrhœa of this\r\ndescription; not by stopping the flow of acrid matter, nor by\r\ndiminishing the irritability of the intestinal organs, as in the\r\ninstances above recited, but, simply, by _acting chemically_ upon the\r\noffending matter, so as to disarm it of its acrid qualities; such, for\r\ninstance, is the nature of _absorbent_ and _testaceous_ medicines. In\r\nthe cure of hemorrhage, if it be _active_, that is to say, connected\r\nwith a state of strong tonic contractility of the blood-vessels, a very\r\ndifferent remedy will be required as an astringent, than in cases of\r\n_passive_ hemorrhage, in which the vascular fibres are in a state of\r\nrelaxation or collapse. Sir Gilbert Blane has offered some valuable\r\nremarks upon this subject, with a view to settle the difference of\r\nopinion which has arisen respecting the treatment of flooding after\r\nchild-birth. (_Medical Logic_, _Edit._ 2d. p. 100.)\r\n\r\nAstringents are capable of being exclusively used as local applications,\r\nand when they are so employed for the purpose of stopping hemorrhage,\r\nthey are termed STYPTICS.[149] With respect to these latter agents it\r\nmust be confessed, that great popular error still exists, much of which\r\nhas evidently arisen from deductions drawn from the effects of such\r\nremedies upon inferior animals; thus have several substances gained the\r\nreputation of _Styptics_, from the result which may have followed their\r\napplication to the wounded and bleeding vessels in the extremities of\r\nthe horse and ass; whereas the fact is, that the blood-vessels of these\r\nanimals possess an inherent power of contraction which does not exist in\r\nthose of man, and to which alone the cessation of the hemorrhage,\r\nfallaciously attributed to the _Styptic_, is to be wholly attributed. In\r\nmany cases an application may owe its styptic qualities to its power of\r\ncoagulating the blood around the orifice of the wound; in this way the\r\ncontact of heated metal will sometimes arrest the flow of blood from a\r\ncut surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           LOCAL STIMULANTS.\r\n\r\nThis Second Division comprehends those medicinal substances, which have\r\nbeen generally classed under the head of EVACUANTS; for, as they\r\nstimulate particular organs, so do they occasion by their local\r\noperation, an increased secretion, or evacuation from them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                EMETICS.\r\n\r\nSubstances which excite vomiting, independent of any effect arising from\r\nthe stimulus of quantity, or of that occasioned by any nauseous taste or\r\nflavour.\r\n\r\nBefore we can determine the _modus operandi_ of emetics, it will be\r\nnecessary to take an accurate view of the phenomena and pathology of\r\nvomiting. It is an important fact that any extraordinary stimulus\r\napplied to the stomach, instead of increasing its motions, as it would\r\nin other instances, actually inverts them: the wisdom of such a peculiar\r\nprovision is manifest; it is intended to prevent the protrusion of the\r\nfood into the duodenum before it has undergone those necessary changes\r\nin the stomach, by which it is prepared for the more elaborate process\r\nof chylification. The act of vomiting, however, is not effected, as Dr.\r\nHaygarth formerly supposed, by the sole influence of the stomach; the\r\nbrain is an important accessary: Dr. Majendie goes so far as to\r\nattribute the operation of vomiting, exclusively, to the agency of this\r\nlatter organ upon the abdominal muscles, and regards the stomach as a\r\nmere passive instrument in the act;[150] this doctrine was supported in\r\nan elaborate experimental memoir, presented by this indefatigable\r\nphysiologist to the Royal Institute of France in the year 1812.\r\n\r\nAlthough we shall not be disposed to receive this theory in its full\r\nextent, yet we cannot hesitate to admit that the influence of the\r\nnervous system is indispensably necessary for producing vomiting; and we\r\naccordingly find that this act will not take place, however forcibly the\r\nstomach may be goaded by emetics, where the energy of the nervous system\r\nis suspended, as in cases of profound intoxication, or in violent wounds\r\nand contusions of the head; while if the brain be only partially\r\ninfluenced, as by incipient intoxication, or by a less violent blow upon\r\nthe head, its irritability is increased instead of being paralysed, and\r\nvomiting under such circumstances is excited by the slightest causes:\r\nthe fact of such opposite results being produced by the same impulse in\r\ndifferent degrees of intensity, is no less curious than instructive. Dr.\r\nRichard Harrison, in his Gulstonian Lecture before the College of\r\nPhysicians, treated the subject of vomiting with much ingenuity, and I\r\nam disposed to adopt the views which he offered. He observed, that\r\nalthough the experiments of Majendie sufficiently testify the importance\r\nof the pressure of the abdominal muscles upon the stomach in the act of\r\nvomiting, and which can only be explained by the influence of the brain\r\nand nervous system, yet that he has attributed too much to their agency;\r\n“it appears to me,” continued he, “that vomiting may be explained in the\r\nfollowing manner:—_the irritation of the stomach makes a call upon the\r\nbrain for the aid of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles, in order\r\nto expel its contents; the diaphragm then becomes contracted and fixed,\r\nthe ribs drawn down, and the abdominal muscles drawn inwards, so that\r\nthe stomach is pressed on all sides by voluntary muscles, which,\r\ntogether_ WITH ITS OWN CONTRACTION, _expel the contents_.” Now it must\r\nbe obvious that where the brain, from oppression or injury, is unable to\r\ntransmit its influence to these muscles,[151] and disregards the call of\r\nthe stomach, vomiting can only be excited with difficulty, or it will be\r\nprevented altogether.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances venesection may in some cases prove a powerful\r\nadjuvant, by unloading the vessels of the brain, and thus restoring to\r\nthe nervous system its necessary excitability; where its powers have\r\nbeen paralysed by the operation of a narcotic, a copious draught of some\r\nvegetable acid, or the affusion of cold water upon the surface of the\r\nbody may impart efficiency to an emetic; the operation of _Nightshade_\r\nand some other narcotic poisons may be adduced in farther illustration\r\nof this subject;—an excessive dose of the _Atropa Belladonna_ produces\r\nsymptoms of alarming stupor, and so difficult is it to evacuate the\r\nstomach under such circumstances, that as much as fourteen grains of\r\n_Tartarized Antimony_ have been administered without effect: now if in\r\nsuch a case a copious draught of some vegetable acid be given, the\r\nemetic will be more likely to succeed: here then we perceive, that the\r\nbrain, being paralysed by a narcotic poison, is unable to lend its aid\r\nto the muscles requisite for the operation of vomiting, until its\r\nenergies are restored by the anti-narcotic powers of a vegetable acid.\r\nThe practical precaution which this view of the subject affords, is\r\nextremely important,—_not to allow the apparently inactive state of the\r\nstomach to induce us, inconsiderately, to augment the dose of an\r\nemetic:_ for although the stomach, for the reasons just stated, may be\r\nunable to void its contents by vomiting, it may nevertheless retain its\r\nsensibility, and be therefore liable to inflammation: Dr. Harrison has\r\nreported a case of this kind, where the practitioner, in attempting to\r\nexcite emesis in an epileptic patient, by a very large dose of _sulphate\r\nof zinc_, produced an inflammation in the viscus that terminated\r\nfatally.\r\n\r\nVomiting may also be produced by the _primary_ operation of certain\r\nagents upon the brain, by which its energy is disturbed, as by\r\nnarcotics, or by the motions of swinging, whirling, and sailing: in such\r\ncases, the series of actions necessary for the establishing of vomiting,\r\ncommences in the brain, and is propagated by nervous sympathy to the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nWhen an emetic is taken into the stomach, an interval of twenty minutes\r\nor longer, usually passes without any apparent effect; an uneasy\r\nsensation, which we term nausea, is then felt, and this continues to\r\nincrease until vomiting begins; here then we perceive are two distinct\r\nstages, each of which is marked by its own proper symptoms; the relative\r\nintensity and duration of which will be found to vary according to the\r\nnature of the exciting causes; thus some Emetics, as _Sulphate of Zinc_,\r\nact without occasioning much nausea, while others, as _Tobacco_ excite\r\nit to a degree which is far greater than is proportioned to their emetic\r\npower: this is a fact of great importance in directing us in the\r\nselection of an Emetic, for we shall find that in some diseases it is a\r\ngreat object to avoid that state of system which invariably accompanies\r\nnausea, while in others it affords the best mode of answering an\r\nimportant indication of cure.\r\n\r\nNausea would seem to depend upon the exertions of the stomach and\r\nmuscles, not being proportioned to the effects of the brain, in order to\r\nproduce vomiting. Where this balance however is maintained, as during\r\nthe operation of an ordinary emetic, the following are the symptoms\r\nwhich characterise the two stages;—while the nausea only is present, the\r\ncountenance is pale and shrunken, the pulse feeble, quick, and\r\nirregular, and there is a feeling of cold; but as soon as vomiting\r\ncommences, the face becomes flushed, the pulse quicker and stronger,\r\nalthough it seldom returns to its natural standard, until some time\r\nafter the vomiting has ceased. A degree of languor, a disposition to\r\nsleep, and a general moisture upon the skin, are the circumstances which\r\noccur after the total cessation of the paroxysm.\r\n\r\nThe feeble state of the circulation, as indicated by the pulse, and the\r\ngeneral coldness and languor experienced during a paroxysm of nausea,\r\nare to be ascribed to those sympathetic relations by which the brain,\r\nstomach, and heart, are reciprocally influenced.\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be obtained from the administration of an emetic in\r\nthe cure of disease, may either depend upon its _primary_, or\r\n_secondary_ operations, that is to say, upon the mere evacuation of the\r\nstomach, or upon those changes which occur in distant parts from\r\nsympathy; and the judicious practitioner, in the selection of an emetic,\r\nwill always be guided by the nature of the indication which he intends\r\nto fulfil; if his object be to evacuate the stomach quickly and\r\ncompletely, he will avoid those emetics that are distinguished by their\r\nnauseating tendency, as in cases of disease which depend on a disordered\r\nstate of stomach, connected with undue distention, and the presence of\r\nacrid and indigestible matter; if, on the other hand, his intention be\r\nto influence some remote organ through the sympathetic powers of the\r\nstomach, an emetic of an opposite tendency may be better calculated to\r\nanswer such indications: in some cases, he is to seek a beneficial\r\nresult from the mechanical action of the diaphragm and abdominal\r\nmuscles, by whose pressure the gall-bladder and hepatic ducts are\r\nemptied of their contents, and hence jaundice, arising from the\r\nobstruction of biliary calculi, has been suddenly removed by the\r\n_concussion_ of an emetic: a similar pressure upon the thoracic viscera\r\nmay occasion expectoration, and relieve the bronchial vessels in cases\r\nof asthma, catarrh, and croup.\r\n\r\nVomiting, when produced by the operation of a mild emetic, does not\r\nappear to exhaust the excitability of the stomach, but on the contrary\r\nto increase its tone; for we generally find the process of digestion is\r\ncarried on more vigorously afterwards; although it is probable that, by\r\nfrequent repetition, a different result would be obtained, and we should\r\nfind that its motion would become liable to inversion by slight stimuli:\r\nwe may therefore question the propriety of that practice which is so\r\nstrenuously recommended by Hippocrates,[152] and other ancient\r\nphysicians, to administer emetics frequently to those in health, in\r\norder to prevent the incursions of disease.\r\n\r\nThe benefits arising from the secondary effects of an emetic are\r\nnumerous and extensive. It has been observed that during nausea the\r\nforce of the circulation is considerably abated, hence the use of these\r\nremedies in hemorrhage; and, as the energy of absorption is generally in\r\nan inverse ratio to that of the circulation,[153] we frequently obtain\r\nfrom a nauseating dose of an emetic, considerable assistance in the\r\ntreatment of anasarca, and other dropsical swellings. Those medicines\r\nthat are liable to produce at once, full vomiting, without any previous\r\nstage of nausea, are of course less calculated to fulfil such\r\nindications. In the same manner we should select a _nauseating_ emetic,\r\nwhen our object is to promote the passage of a gall stone through the\r\n_ductus communis_, for the nausea so excited will relax the duct, while\r\nthe mechanical concussion tends to push the obstructing matter forward.\r\nOn the other hand, whenever our object is to evacuate the stomach, and\r\nto prevent absorption, we must take care to cut short the nauseating\r\nstage; a precaution which is highly important in the treatment of a case\r\nof poisoning. The state of the stomach produced by vomiting is very\r\nfrequently extended, by sympathy, to the vessels of the skin; in\r\nconsequence of which, a diaphoresis not unusually follows the operation.\r\nIn the different varieties of febrile disease, this circumstance stamps\r\nadditional value upon the class of Emetics; while, at the same time,\r\nthat they eject any offensive matter which may be present in the\r\nstomach, they thus control the accelerated circulation.\r\n\r\nFrom the violent muscular exertions which take place in the act of\r\nvomiting, the administration of an emetic may be very injurious in\r\ncertain states of the body. In consequence of the pressure applied to\r\nthe descending aorta, and the interrupted circulation through the lungs,\r\nfrom impeded respiration, the blood returns with difficulty from the\r\nhead during a paroxysm of vomiting, and in plethoric states of the body,\r\nor in cases of determination of blood to the cerebral or pulmonary\r\norgans, the act of vomiting cannot be considered as free from danger.\r\nThe concussion of an emetic may also produce mischief in the advanced\r\nstage of pregnancy, and in _hernia_ and _prolapsus uteri_; while in\r\nextreme debility, there is the danger of a syncope being produced, from\r\nwhich the patient may never recover, as I once witnessed in the last\r\nstage of Phthisis, where an emetic was imprudently given, with the\r\nintention of dislodging the pus with which the lungs were embarrassed.\r\n\r\nBy violent and protracted retching, a person will sometimes become\r\njaundiced; the stomach, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles, are, under\r\nsuch repeated efforts, apt to be rendered, to an eminent degree,\r\nirritable; so that at each effort of the former to discharge its\r\ncontents, the latter will frequently be thrown into strong spasmodic\r\ncontractions, and the liver together with the gall bladder will be\r\nsuddenly caught, and, as it were, squeezed in a powerful press; in\r\nconsequence of which the bile will regurgitate, and be carried into the\r\n_Venæ cavæ_; for Haller has shewn with what facility a subtle injection,\r\nwhen thrown into the hepatic duct, will escape by the hepatic veins; and\r\nupon which Dr. Saunders observes, “I know this to be a fact, for I have\r\nascertained by experiment, that water injected in the same direction,\r\nwill return by the veins in a full stream, though very little force be\r\nused.” When a jaundice is thus produced it will gradually disappear\r\nwithout the aid of any medicine; the kidneys are the principal means by\r\nwhich all unnecessary bodies are extracted from the circulating mass, a\r\nportion of bile will therefore under such circumstances be eliminated in\r\nevery discharge of urine.\r\n\r\nThe different emetics employed in practice are derived from the\r\nvegetable and mineral kingdoms, some of which appear to produce their\r\neffects by an immediate impression upon the nerves of the stomach, while\r\nothers require to be absorbed into the circulation before they display\r\ntheir energies. _Ipecacuanha_ would seem to act primarily on the\r\nstomach, but _Tartarized Antimony_ has been found, by experiment, to\r\noccasion vomiting, when injected into the veins of an animal; while the\r\nother mineral emetics, _viz._ the preparations of _Copper_ and _Zinc_,\r\nundoubtedly operate on the stomach, and without inducing much nausea.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CATHARTICS:\r\n\r\nMedicines which quicken or increase the evacuation from the intestines,\r\nor which, when given in a certain dose, occasion purging.\r\n\r\nThese remedies, from a general difference in their modes of operation,\r\nhave been classed under two divisions—LAXATIVES and PURGATIVES. The\r\nformer operate so mildly that they merely evacuate the contents of the\r\nintestines, without occasioning any general excitement in the body, or\r\neven stimulating the exhalant vessels of the canal; the latter produce a\r\nconsiderable influx of fluids from these vessels, and extend their\r\nstimulant effect to the system in general; and where these effects are\r\nvery violent, the purgative is further distinguished by the epithet\r\nDRASTIC. Laxatives then may be said to empty the bowels simply, and to\r\ncarry off extraneous matter, which is out of the course of the\r\ncirculation; but purgatives, as they occasion a constitutional effect,\r\nmay be made subservient to very important purposes. The effects of a\r\npurgative may depend upon three different modes of operation; viz.\r\n\r\n     1. _By stimulating the muscular fibres of the Intestines, whence\r\n       their peristaltic motion is augmented, and the contents of the\r\n       bowels more quickly and completely discharged._\r\n\r\n     2. _By stimulating the exhalent vessels, terminating in the inner\r\n       coat of the intestines, and the mouths of the excretory ducts of\r\n       the mucous glands; by which an increased flow of serous fluids\r\n       takes place from the former, and a more copious discharge of\r\n       mucus from the latter; the effect of which is to render the fæcal\r\n       matter thinner and more abundant._\r\n\r\n     3. _By stimulating the neighbouring viscera, as the Liver and\r\n       Pancreas, so as to produce a more copious flow of their\r\n       secretions into the intestines._\r\n\r\nIt appears that different purgatives have very different powers in\r\nrelation to the several modes of operation above specified; some\r\nmedicines, for example, urge the bowels to evacuate their contents by an\r\nimperceptible action upon the muscular fibres, and little or no increase\r\nof serous discharge attends the evacuation, such are _Manna_, _Sulphur_,\r\nand _Magnesia_; there would seem, moreover, to be certain bodies that\r\nhave the property of increasing the peristaltic motions by operating as\r\nmechanical stimulants upon the fibre; it would not be difficult to\r\nderive many illustrations of this fact, from the history of herbivorous\r\nquadrupeds, and I have been disposed to consider the harsh and coarse\r\ntexture which certain grasses assume in moist situations, as a wise\r\nprovision in Nature to furnish an increased stimulus to the intestines\r\nof the animals who feed upon them, at a time when their diminished\r\nnutritive qualities must render such a result desirable; but the\r\noperation of a mechanical laxative may be demonstrated by a more\r\nfamiliar example; the addition of bran to our bread, constituting what\r\nis known by the name of _Brown bread_, induces laxative effects, merely\r\nfrom the mechanical friction of the rough particles, or scales of the\r\nbran, upon the inner coats of the intestines, for the wheat without the\r\nbran in bread is not particularly laxative.[154] Other cathartics\r\nstimulate the fibres to a much greater degree, and the effects are\r\neither confined to a part of the canal, or communicated to the whole\r\nrange of the intestines, from the duodenum to the extremity of the\r\nrectum; _Aloes_ will furnish a good example of the former, and\r\n_Colocynth_ may be adduced as an instance of the latter mode of\r\noperation. Other cathartics, again, direct all their stimulus to the\r\nexhalant vessels, and are accordingly distinguished by the force with\r\nwhich they produce serous evacuations; and for which they were formerly\r\ndenominated _Hydragogues_, such are _Saline Purgatives_, and certain\r\nvegetable bodies to be hereafter described. Dr. Cullen has even supposed\r\nthat some of these medicines may act solely in this way, and without\r\nincreasing directly the peristaltic motion; there is, however, as Dr.\r\nMurray very justly remarks, no proof of such an hypothesis, and it seems\r\nscarcely probable that any substance should act as a stimulant on these\r\nvessels, without at the same time stimulating the mobile fibres of the\r\nintestines. _Mercurial Purgatives_ appear to possess, in an eminent\r\ndegree, the power of exciting the functions of the liver, and of thereby\r\noccasioning an influx of bile into the intestines. From the indications\r\nwhich cathartics are capable of fulfilling, their utility in many\r\ndiseases must be apparent; the extent of their importance and value\r\nwere, however, never justly appreciated until the valuable publication\r\nof Dr. Hamilton on this subject, in which the author has pointed out\r\nwith more precision than any preceding writers had done, the therapeutic\r\nprinciples which should regulate their administration. His practice has\r\nclearly proved that a state of bowels may exist in many diseases, giving\r\nrise to a retention of feculent matter, which will not be obviated by\r\nthe occasional administration of a purgative, but which requires a\r\ncontinuation of the alvine stimulant, until the healthy action of the\r\nbowels is re-established. Since this view of the subject has been\r\nadopted, numerous diseases have received alleviation from the use of\r\npurgatives that were formerly treated with a different class of\r\nremedies, and which were not supposed to have any connection with the\r\nstate of the alvine evacuations; thus in fever, the peristaltic motion\r\nof the intestines is diminished, and their feculent contents are unduly\r\nretained, and perhaps, in part, absorbed, becoming of course a source of\r\nmorbid irritation; this fact has long been understood, and the practice\r\nof administering cathartic medicines under such circumstances has been\r\nvery generally adopted; but until the publication of Dr. Hamilton,\r\nphysicians were not aware of the necessity of carrying the plan to an\r\nextent beyond that of merely emptying the _primæ viæ_, and they did not\r\ncontinue the free use of these remedies through the whole progress of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nCathartics are essentially serviceable also in several diseases of the\r\nclass NEUROSES, which are generally intimately connected with a morbid\r\ncondition of the alimentary passages; _Chorea_ and _Hysteria_ have been\r\nvery successfully treated in this manner. The diseases incident to\r\npuberty in both sexes are also best relieved by a course of purgative\r\nmedicines, and their effects in _Chlorosis_ have conferred upon many of\r\nthem the specific title of EMMENAGOGUES.\r\n\r\nBut the therapeutical utility of Cathartics extends beyond the mere\r\nfeculent evacuations which they may occasion. In consequence of the\r\nstimulating action which some of them exert upon the exhalent vessels,\r\nthey abstract a considerable portion of fluid from the general current\r\nof the circulation, and are, on that account, beneficial as\r\n_Anti-phlogistics_. For the same reason they may act as powerful\r\npromoters of absorption, for there exists an established relation\r\nbetween the powers of exhalation and absorption, so that when the action\r\nof one is increased, that of the other is augmented.\r\n\r\nCertain Purgatives, as I have just stated, exert their influence upon\r\nthe neighbouring organs, and are calculated not only to remove alvine\r\n_sordes_, but to detach and eliminate foul congestions from the biliary\r\nducts and pores.\r\n\r\nWith such facts before us, it is impossible to concede to the opinion of\r\nDr. Hamilton,[155] that the different species of purgative medicines _do\r\nnot possess distinct powers over the different species of matter to be\r\nevacuated_; on the contrary, there is reason for reviving the ancient\r\ntheory, too inconsiderately abandoned, and which acknowledged these\r\ndifferent distinctions in the operations of cathartic medicines, under\r\nthe appropriate names of _Hydragogues_, _Cholagogues_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe importance of cathartic medicines having been shewn, and the\r\ndistinctions in their modes of operation established, it only remains to\r\nsay a few words upon the subject of their abuse. All the remedies of\r\nthis class, but more especially those of considerable power, require\r\ncaution in their administration, even in those diseases where they are\r\nindicated by peculiar symptoms, especially if there be any tendency to\r\ninflammation, or to extreme debility, although this latter symptom is\r\noften rather apparent than real, and is at once removed by the brisk\r\noperation upon the bowels; during pregnancy and immediately after\r\ndelivery, and during the flow of the menses, the prudent practitioner\r\nwill use a discretionary caution in their exhibition. The too frequent\r\nuse of these medicines will induce marasmus, and render the bowels so\r\nmorbidly irritable, that purging is easily excited by the ordinary\r\nstimulus of our aliments; while in some habits the contrary obtains, and\r\nthe resource to which the valetudinarian flies for relief only increases\r\nthe torpor of the intestines, and confirms his costiveness.\r\n\r\nThe mode of adapting, combining, and administering Cathartics, will\r\npresent subjects for our future consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EMMENAGOGUES:\r\n\r\nMedicines which are capable of producing the Menstrual discharge.\r\n\r\nAs Amenorrhœa, or retention of the menses, is generally the effect of a\r\nmorbid state of the body, it follows that remedies capable of acting as\r\nEmmenagogues can only be _relative_ agents, unless indeed we are\r\ndisposed to accede to the opinion so generally maintained in the\r\nwritings of the older physicians, but now generally discarded, _that\r\ncertain substances exert a specific[156] action upon the uterus_. It may\r\ncertainly be asserted without fear of contradiction, that there are many\r\nsubstances which, when received into the stomach, have their stimulant\r\noperation more particularly determined to one part than to another;\r\nalkalics, for example, to the kidneys; cantharides to the bladder;\r\nmercury to the salivary glands, &c. Reasoning therefore by analogy, it\r\nwas not unphilosophical to conclude, that similar medicines might exist\r\nwith respect to the uterus; but experience has negatived the\r\nsupposition, there being no proof of any of the substances styled\r\n_Emmenagogues_ producing their effects by any _specific_ influence upon\r\nthe uterine system. If the term _Emmenagogue_ be assumed conventionally,\r\naccording to this view of the subject, it may be retained without any\r\nfear of error, otherwise it would be wiser to remove the name from our\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the catamenia usually depends upon a debilitated\r\nstate of the body, although it is sometimes the consequence of a\r\nplethoric diathesis; in the former cases tonics, in the latter,\r\nvenesection may display the powers of an emmenagogue; upon which\r\noccasion, I have frequently derived the greatest benefit by cupping the\r\npatient upon the loins. Where the disease occurs in young women, about\r\nthe age of puberty, it is very generally connected with extreme debility\r\nof the system; the preparations of iron, bark, and other invigorating\r\nmedicines, are accordingly the most likely to succeed in its cure.\r\nWhereas in full florid habits, when the catamenia are suddenly\r\nsuppressed, _Laxatives_, _Diaphoretics_, or _blood-letting_, afford the\r\nsurest means of relief.\r\n\r\nThere are two other classes of medicine which may occasionally prove\r\nemmenagogue—ACRID PURGATIVES, which act upon the rectum, and hence by\r\n_contiguous sympathy_ upon the uterus, as _Aloes_, &c. and STIMULATING\r\nDIURETICS, as _Cantharides_, the _Turpentines_, &c. which are supposed\r\nto excite the womb, sympathetically, by their stimulus upon the bladder.\r\nNor is the advantageous influence of mercury to be overlooked, which, in\r\ncases of morbid action in the secreting functions, prove a Herculean\r\nremedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DIURETICS:\r\n\r\nMedicines which increase the urinary discharge.\r\n\r\nThis effect is produced by very different modes of operation; and as\r\nsome of them are mutually incompatible with each other, it is essential\r\nthat we should understand the _modus operandi_ of each individual of\r\nwhich the class consists, in order that we may direct its application\r\nwith precision.\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly no tribe of medicinal agents more precarious in\r\ntheir nature and effects than that of Diuretics; this fact in a great\r\nmeasure depends upon the uncontrollable character of the organs upon\r\nwhich they act, but it must at the same time be admitted, that their\r\nfailure frequently depends upon their modes of operation being directly\r\nincompatible with the state of the system at the time of their\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nThe following classification may perhaps serve to bring together the\r\nprincipal facts which are known upon the subject, and at the same time\r\nto display them in an order which is calculated to demonstrate their\r\npractical bearings and relations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DIURETICS,\r\n\r\n        ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THEIR SUPPOSED MODES OF OPERATION.\r\n\r\n  CL: I.—MEDICINES WHICH ACT _PRIMARILY_ ON THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n      1. _By stimulating the secreting vessels of the kidneys_, BY\r\n          CONTACT.\r\n\r\n          _a_ The medicines not undergoing any decomposition _in\r\n              transitu_.\r\n\r\n              1. _Potassa._\r\n\r\n              2. _Potassæ Nitras._\r\n\r\n              3. _Oleum Terebinthinæ._\r\n\r\n              4. _Juniperus Communis._\r\n\r\n              5. _Cantharides._\r\n\r\n          _b_ The Medicines undergoing decomposition _in transitu_.\r\n\r\n              1. _Potassæ Acetas._\r\n\r\n              2. _Potassæ Super-tartras._\r\n\r\n              3. _Scilla Maritima._\r\n\r\n              4. _Colchicum Autumnale._\r\n\r\n              5. _Copaifera Officinalis._\r\n\r\n              6. _Spartii Cacumina._\r\n\r\n  CL: II.—MEDICINES WHICH ACT _PRIMARILY_ ON THE ABSORBENTS, AND\r\n      _SECONDARILY_ ON THE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\n                                                              _Mercury._\r\n\r\n  CL: III.—MEDICINES WHICH ACT _PRIMARILY_ ON THE STOMACH AND PRIMÆ VIÆ,\r\n      AND _SECONDARILY_ ON THE ABSORBENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _By diminishing arterial action, and increasing that of Absorption._\r\n\r\n      1. _Digitalis._\r\n\r\n      2. _Nicotiana._\r\n\r\n      2. _By increasing the tone of the Body in general, and that of the\r\n          absorbent system in particular._\r\n\r\n              _Bitter Tonics_, _&c._ _&c._\r\n\r\n      3. _By producing Catharsis, and thereby increasing the action of\r\n          the Exhalants_ directly, _and that of the Absorbents_\r\n          indirectly.\r\n\r\n          1. _Elaterium._\r\n\r\n          2. _Jalap_, _&c._ _&c._\r\n\r\n\r\nC. 1. OF MEDICINES WHICH ACT PRIMARILY ON THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\n      1. _By stimulating the secreting vessels of the kidneys, by actual\r\n          contact._\r\n\r\n          _a_ The substance not undergoing any decomposition _in\r\n              transitu_.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to imagine that any substance which is capable of entering\r\nthe current of the circulation, and of stimulating the kidneys by a\r\ndirect application to their secerning vessels, may occasion a more\r\ncopious urinary discharge; in this manner the different saline[157]\r\npreparations, _Potass_, _Soda_, _Nitrate of Potass_, _&c._ are brought\r\nto the kidneys in the course of the circulation, and exciting the\r\nvessels to an increased action, promote the secretion of a larger\r\nproportion of watery fluid from the blood, in consequence of which, the\r\nabsorbents are indirectly stimulated in order to supply the deficiency,\r\nand in this manner dropsical swellings are reduced.\r\n\r\nWater, as a simple diluent, will promote the action of the kidneys, and\r\nit is very judiciously remarked by Dr. Cullen, that by withholding the\r\nuse of fluids in dropsy, you will diminish the quantity of fluids\r\nsecreted, and allow the secretories of the kidneys to fall into a state\r\nof inactivity and collapse. This is a sufficient answer to those who\r\ndefend the practice of enjoining an abstinence from all drinks in\r\ndropsy.\r\n\r\n          b. _The diuretic remedy undergoing decomposition_ IN TRANSITU.\r\n\r\nThe digestive organs appear to possess the power of readily decomposing\r\nall saline compounds into which _vegetable_ acids enter as ingredients,\r\nand of eliminating their alkaline base, which, being in the course of\r\nthe circulation, carried to the kidneys, excites them into action, and\r\npromotes the excretion of urine; and it is probably in this way that the\r\n_Acetate_, _Citrate_, _Super-tartrate_, and other analogous combinations\r\nof _Potass_ and _Soda_ prove diuretic: on the other hand, it is equally\r\nevident that salts containing the _mineral_ acids are not under the\r\ncontrol of the decomposing powers of the _chylo-poietic_ organs, and\r\nconsequently do not undergo any changes _in transitu_, although some of\r\nthese salts, as I have just stated, especially the more soluble ones,\r\nare absorbed entire, and prove diuretic. _Sulphate of Potass_, from its\r\ninsolubility, is not readily absorbed, and its composition will not\r\nallow the developement of its base; we perceive therefore that it has\r\nnot any tendency to produce an influence upon the urinary secretion.\r\n\r\nCertain vegetable bodies likewise appear to occasion diuresis by a\r\nsimilar mode of operation, and it is worthy of notice that these\r\nmedicines generally contain a bitter principle, which is probably\r\nseparated by the analysing powers of the stomach; as exemplified in\r\n_Scilla maritima_; _Colchicum autumnale_; _Lactuca Virosa_; _Gratiola\r\nofficinalis_; _Spartium Scoparium_ (Summitates); _Juniperus communis_;\r\n_Copaifera Officinalis_ (Balsamum,) &c. The stimulant powers of a bitter\r\nvegetable principle upon the _primæ viæ_, have already been fully\r\nnoticed under the consideration of TONICS, (_page 78_), and it is\r\nreasonable to suppose, that an analogous principle, if introduced into\r\nthe circulation, may exert a corresponding impulse upon the organs with\r\nwhich it comes into contact.\r\n\r\nIt particularly merits attention, that the diuretic operation of any\r\nbody that acts by being absorbed, is at once suspended if catharsis\r\nfollows its administration, whether in consequence of the largeness of\r\nits dose, its increased solubility, or from the effect of its\r\ncombination with some purgative; for it is a law, _that the processes of\r\nassimilation, and absorption from the duodenum, are arrested, or very\r\nimperfectly performed during any alvine excitement_; the different\r\neffects of the saline compounds of the alkalies with tartaric acid,\r\nelucidate the truth of this law in a very striking manner—thus,\r\n_Super-tartrate of Potass_, or Cream of Tartar, in well regulated doses,\r\nacts, as we all know, upon the kidneys; the tartaric acid being, as I\r\nsuppose in this case, abstracted and assimilated by the digestive\r\nprocess, and at the same time the alkaline base (Potass) eliminated, and\r\nsubsequently carried into the circulation; but if we increase the\r\nsolubility of the compound, by reducing it to the state of a neutral\r\ntartrate (_soluble tartar_), or by combining it with _Boracic acid_, or\r\nsome body that has a similar effect; or what is equivalent to it, if we\r\nso increase the dose[158] of the _cream of tartar_, that full catharsis\r\nfollows its administration, then diuresis will not ensue, since no\r\ndecomposition can take place under such circumstances, nor can it be\r\ncarried by absorption into the circulation. _Nitre_ and those salts\r\nwhich are carried to the kidneys without previous decomposition _in\r\ntransitu_, are subject to the same law; for, if we combine them with\r\npurgatives, their presence can no longer be recognised in the urine, as\r\nI have ascertained by experiment. _Oil of Turpentine_ in doses of two\r\nfluid-drachms, may so excite the urinary organs as to produce even\r\nbloody urine; whereas a fluid-ounce will scarcely occasion any apparent\r\ninfluence upon those functions, because the increased dose acts upon the\r\nbowels, and consequently prevents its passage into the circulation.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Magnesia_ does not readily produce any diuresis, because it\r\noperates upon the bowels, but the experiments of Vitet and Bracy Clarke\r\nhave shewn, that if this saline compound be administered to the horse\r\nwhose bowels are not easily affected by purgatives, it acts powerfully\r\nupon the kidneys;[159] and I will take occasion in this place to observe\r\nthat, on account of the inirritability of the bowels of the horse,\r\ndiuretic medicines are more certain in their operation, than in the\r\nhuman subject; a fact which, in itself, shews the importance of\r\nattending to the state of the bowels, during a course of those diuretics\r\nwhich require to be absorbed before they can produce their specific\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nEqually necessary is it to attend to the state of the vessels of the\r\nskin, for if during the administration of a Diuretic, these vessels be\r\nexcited by external warmth, its action may be diverted from the urinary\r\norgans to the exhalants on the surface, and occasion diaphoresis; but if\r\nthe surface of the body be kept cool, this diversion will not occur: so\r\ngreatly indeed does cooling the surface determine to the kidneys, that\r\nthe usual diaphoretic medicines may, by an attention to this\r\ncircumstance, be converted into powerful diuretics.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. II. MEDICINES WHICH ACT _Primarily_ ON THE ABSORBENTS, AND\r\n_Secondarily_ ON THE KIDNEYS.\r\n\r\nIt has been shewn, in the former division, that by increasing the action\r\nof the kidneys, we diminish the quantity of water in the blood, and\r\nconsequently occasion an extraordinary action of the absorbents to\r\nsupply the deficiency, whence dropsical accumulations disappear; it\r\nremains to be stated that an operation, which may be considered the\r\nconverse of the one just described, is not unfrequently established: the\r\nabsorbent vessels, in this case, are first roused to extraordinary\r\naction, and the blood therefore becomes surcharged with serous matter,\r\nin consequence of which the kidneys are stimulated, and it is eliminated\r\nthrough the urinary passages: so that in the former case the absorbent\r\nmay be said to be called into action by the kidneys, while in the\r\nlatter, the kidneys are obviously subservient to the increased energy of\r\nthe absorbent system. The preparations of Mercury are perhaps the only\r\nmedicinal bodies which we can strictly consider as specific stimulants\r\nto the absorbent system; and of their power in directly acting upon\r\nthese organs there are such ample proofs, that it is unnecessary to\r\nadduce any additional evidence upon the subject. In instances of\r\nincreased absorption from the agency of other medicines, the effect must\r\nbe considered as rather arising from their _secondary_ than primary\r\noperations; the most important of which will constitute objects of\r\ninquiry in the succeeding divisions of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. III. MEDICINES WHICH ACT _Primarily_ ON THE STOMACH OR SYSTEM, AND\r\n_Secondarily_ ON THE URINARY ORGANS.\r\n\r\nA Diuretic effect is very frequently occasioned by substances which act\r\non the stomach and _primæ viæ_, producing a peculiar state of these\r\norgans, which _sympathetically_ affects the whole body, and more\r\nparticularly the absorbent system, and the vessels concerned in the\r\nsecretion of urine from the blood. As this primary influence upon the\r\nstomach, and the effects to which it gives rise in remote parts, are\r\nvery different in their character, according to the nature of the remedy\r\nemployed, and the state of the system at the time of its administration;\r\nthe present attempt to investigate and generalize these relations, and\r\nto adopt them as the basis of a classification, may ultimately lead the\r\npractitioner to some distinctions of practical utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _By diminishing Arterial Action, and increasing that of Absorption._\r\n\r\nIt would appear that the action of the vessels employed in the\r\ncirculation of the blood, and the energy of the absorbents are, to a\r\ncertain extent, antagonist powers; the experiments of Majendie\r\ndemonstrate that the absorption of a poisonous substance is retarded by\r\na plethoric, and accelerated by a depleted state of the sanguineous\r\nsystem; the fact is practically established by numerous phenomena in\r\npathology. Dr. Blackall has very satisfactorily shewn the existence\r\nwhich subsists between increased arterial action and diminished\r\nabsorption. Hence it follows that remedies capable of controlling the\r\ncirculation may affect the activity of absorption, increase diuresis,\r\nand cure dropsy; in this manner the _Digitalis Purpurea_ acts as a\r\nsorbefacient, and it may be remarked that it seldom or never produces\r\nits diuretic effects, without a concomitant reduction of the frequency\r\nof the pulse; its power too appears only when it is administered in\r\ndropsy; in a state of health it will reduce the pulse, but not increase\r\nthe discharge of urine. Tobacco has also somewhat analogous powers in\r\npromoting absorption, and its operation is accompanied with a\r\ncorresponding depression of vascular action. Venesection, upon the same\r\nprinciple, may occasion, in certain cases of dropsy, a discharge of the\r\naccumulated fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _By increasing the tone of the Body in general, and that of the\r\nAbsorbent System in particular._\r\n\r\nThat diminished absorption, and the consequent accumulation of serous\r\nfluids in the cellular texture, and different cavities, frequently\r\ndepends upon general debility is very obvious, whence fevers, whether of\r\nthe intermittent, or continued kind, which have been long protracted,\r\nare followed by _œdematous_ swellings. In states of extreme debility the\r\nexhalant vessels would seem, from their laxity, to permit the thinner\r\nparts of the blood to pass too readily through them; this is proved by\r\nthe circumstance that palsied limbs, in which such a laxity may be\r\npresumed to exist, are frequently affected with _œdema_, and the truth\r\nof this explanation is still farther corroborated by the advantages\r\nwhich accrue on these occasions from the mechanical support of pressure\r\nfrom bandages. In such cases, those remedies which are capable of\r\nrenovating the vigour of the body can alone prove of any signal service.\r\nDr. Blackall presents us with an illustrative case of this nature, on\r\nthe authority of Mr. Johnson of Exeter, in which the tonic powers of\r\nwell fermented bread occasioned in the space of a few hours an effect so\r\npowerfully diuretic, as to have cured sailors on board of the Asia East\r\nIndiaman, who had been attacked with Dropsy, in consequence of the use\r\nof damaged Rice.\r\n\r\nThus then do Diuretics, in some cases, CURE BY EVACUATING, while in\r\nothers, as in the instance above cited, they EVACUATE BY CURING.\r\n\r\nA case has lately occurred in my own practice, which not only affords a\r\nstriking illustration of the present views, but is well calculated to\r\nconvey to the inexperienced practitioner a very instructive lesson of\r\ncaution. A man of the age of thirty-five, of the most dissolute habits,\r\nwas attacked after a debauch of several days’ continuance, with\r\ninflammatory symptoms in the chest; a very large quantity of blood was\r\nsuddenly abstracted, and the bleeding was repeated after the interval of\r\na few hours. The respiration became laborious, and I was desired to\r\nvisit the patient; I found that little or no urine had been evacuated\r\nsince the attack, and that there were evident symptoms of effusion, the\r\nlegs were swollen, and the difficulty of breathing was rapidly\r\nincreasing. Under these circumstances I directed a large dose of\r\n_Ammonia_ with some stimulating diuretics, which were to be repeated at\r\nshort intervals. On the following day the distressing symptoms had\r\nsubsided, a large quantity of urine had passed, and the patient\r\nexpressed himself greatly relieved; unfortunately, however, in\r\nconsequence of a slight increase of his distress in the evening, an\r\ninjudicious friend in attendance, took more blood from the arm—the\r\ndropsical effusions rapidly increased, and life was extinguished in the\r\ncourse of three days by confirmed Hydrothorax.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _By producing Catharsis, and thereby increasing the action of the\r\nExhalants_ directly, _and that of the absorbents_ indirectly.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, under the consideration of Cathartics, that\r\ncertain medicines of that class excite the exhalants of the alimentary\r\ncanal, and occasion a very copious discharge of serous matter: by this\r\noperation the blood is deprived of a large portion of water, and the\r\nabsorbents are thus indirectly stimulated to supply the deficiency;\r\n_Elaterium_, and some other _hydragogue_ cathartics, may be thus\r\nemployed with extraordinary success for the cure of certain forms of\r\nDropsy, where the vital powers of the patient can sustain the violence\r\nof the remedy;—in the whole circle of medicinal operations there is\r\nnothing more wonderful than this, that an impression made on the\r\ninternal surface of the _primæ viæ_, by a few particles of matter,\r\nshould thus convey by magic as it were, an impulse to the most remote\r\nextremities, rousing their absorbents to action; and, in case of _œdema_\r\nthere, awakening the sleeping energies of these vessels, which like\r\nmillions of pumps at work, transmit the morbid fluid to the intestines\r\nand urinary passages, effecting a detumescence of the hydropic limbs in\r\nthe course of a few hours, and thus affording a striking illustration of\r\nthe sympathetic action of medicines, and an instructive example of the\r\noperation of those of the sorbefacient class.[160]\r\n\r\nThe observations which I have thus offered will lead the practitioner to\r\nselect the particular diuretic which is best calculated to fulfil the\r\nindications of each individual case; and they will at the same time\r\npoint out those which cannot be administered in combination, without a\r\nviolation of the law of medicinal compatibility. With respect to the\r\ngeneral efficacy of these medicines it may be stated, that where the\r\ndisease originates from _organic_ affections of the chylo-poietic\r\nviscera, it will not be cured by the mere evacuation of the water by\r\ndiuretics; but that where it has taken place from diminished absorption,\r\nthese remedies may be reasonably expected to effect a cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             DIAPHORETICS.\r\n\r\nThe term _Diaphoretic_ has been applied to those medicines which\r\nincrease the natural exhalation of the skin, and when they act so\r\npowerfully as to occasion sweating, they have been commonly\r\ndistinguished by the name of _Sudorifics_, but as no difference exists\r\nbetween these remedies, but in the degree of force with which they act,\r\nwe may very properly comprehend the whole under the general title of\r\nDiaphoretics: the fluid effused is also in both cases similar, but in\r\nthe one it is discharged more slowly, and is carried off by the\r\nconducting[161] power of the air, in the insensible form of vapour,\r\nwhile in the other case it is so copiously effused from the exhalant\r\nvessels, as to appear in the liquid form.\r\n\r\nAs obstructed perspiration may depend upon very different, and even\r\nopposite states of the system, so may the most adverse medicines fall\r\nunder the denomination of diaphoretic remedies.\r\n\r\nIn some affections, a deficient diaphoresis may be associated with\r\nincreased vascular action, and in others, with a slow languid\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nDiaphoretics may be considered as operating, either by directly\r\nstimulating the cutaneous capillaries;—by increasing the general action\r\nof the vascular system;—by relaxing the morbidly constricted mouths of\r\nthe perspiratory vessels;—or, lastly, by producing at once both the\r\nlatter of these effects.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with the plan adopted on other occasions, I shall proceed\r\nto investigate the powers of this class of medicines, according to their\r\nsupposed modes of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DIAPHORETICS\r\n\r\nOccasion their effects—\r\n\r\n  I. BY STIMULATING THE CUTANEOUS CAPILLARIES.\r\n\r\n      _A._ By external application.\r\n\r\n          _The Stimulus of Heat_, _Frictions_, _&c._\r\n\r\n      _B._ By Medicines which enter the circulation and stimulate the\r\n          cutaneous vessels _by contact_.\r\n\r\n          _Mercurials_—_Sulphur_.\r\n\r\n      _C._ By Medicines which act on the surface _sympathetically_,\r\n          through the medium of the Stomach.\r\n\r\n          _Cold Drinks_, _&c._\r\n\r\n  II. BY INCREASING THE GENERAL ACTION OF THE VASCULAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n          _Violent Exercise_—_Ammonia_—_Guaiacum_—_Alcohol_—_Warm Bath_.\r\n\r\n  III. BY RELAXING THE MORBIDLY CONSTRICTED MOUTHS OF THE PERSPIRATORY\r\n      VESSELS.\r\n\r\n          _Antimonials_—_Cold Affusion_—_Venesection_—_Saline\r\n          Diaphoretics_.\r\n\r\nThe action of the cutaneous vessels may be augmented by heat, without\r\nnecessarily increasing, at the same time, that of the heart and\r\narteries; hence it is that heat is, of itself, often sufficient to\r\nproduce sweating, while it generally accelerates the operation of a\r\nsudorific medicine. To this general proposition, however, there are some\r\nvery important exceptions; and, indeed, in certain conditions of the\r\ncutaneous surface, the stimulus of heat will be even found to impede,\r\nrather than to promote, diaphoresis; thus in the hot stage of a\r\ncontinued fever, there would seem to exist a peculiar constriction of\r\nthe perspiratory vessels, accompanied with extreme heat and dryness. In\r\nsuch a state, remedies of the third class must be applied, or conjoined\r\nwith those of the former. The warm bath may be said to partake of _all_\r\nthe qualities upon which our classification is founded; it will\r\nstimulate the cutaneous capillaries,—increase vascular action,\r\ngenerally, and, by its emollient powers, relax the morbidly constricted\r\nmouths of the perspiratory vessels. During the ardent heat of fever, the\r\nexternal application of cold is the most efficient sudorific, as the\r\nvaluable reports of Dr. Currie have very satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nAlthough the _external_ application of cold was not often employed in\r\nthe hot stage of fever, until within the last thirty years, yet the\r\nadministration of cold _drinks_ appears to have been practised by the\r\nancients, as an expedient to produce perspiration. Galen, and his\r\nimmediate disciples, as well as the physicians of the sixteenth century,\r\nseem to have frequently administered cold water for the purpose of\r\nexciting sweat in fevers.[162] Celsus also describes the beneficial\r\neffects which arise from copious draughts of cold water in ardent\r\nfevers, “fereque post longam sitim et vigiliam, post multam satietatem,\r\npost infractum calorem, plenus somnus venit, per quem _ingens sudor\r\neffunditur_, idque præsentissimum auxilium est.”[163] Cold water, when\r\nintroduced into the stomach in the hot stage of fever, must produce its\r\ndiaphoretic effect through the sympathetic relation which subsists\r\nbetween that organ and the skin. Nauseating doses of _Antimony_, and of\r\nother emetics, occasion a relaxation of the surface from the same mode\r\nof operation, and in this latter case, if the force of the circulation\r\nbe at the same time increased by tepid diluents, the diaphoretic effect\r\nis more certain and considerable.\r\n\r\n_Alcohol_, _Guaiacum_, and other powerful stimulants, produce their\r\neffects by merely accelerating the circulation; but in employing such\r\nremedies for the purpose of exciting sweat, we must be careful to adapt\r\nthem to the circumstances of the case, and to the degree of action which\r\nprevails. In all febrile diseases attended with much increased heat, or\r\nconnected with local inflammation, diaphoretics of this description must\r\nbe very cautiously administered, for by accelerating the circulation\r\nthey might counteract any benefit which they would otherwise confer by\r\nrelaxing the vessels of the skin. In the whole history of medical\r\nopinions there is scarcely a theory which has proved so fatal in its\r\npractical applications as that maintained by Van Helmont, and his\r\ndisciples, viz. that _acute diseases were to be cured by expelling some\r\nmorbific matter, after its proper concoction_—a theory which suggested\r\nthe administration of the most stimulating sudorifics, together with\r\nhigh temperature[164] in every grade of febrile exacerbation. The fatal\r\neffects of such a practice during the seventeenth, and early parts of\r\nthe eighteenth centuries, are incalculable, and may be very\r\nsatisfactorily contrasted with the beneficial results which have\r\naccrued, in the same diseases, in the present age, from the use of\r\ndiaphoretics of the refrigerant kind.\r\n\r\n_Saline Diaphoretics_, as they readily pass with the chyle, may be\r\nsupposed to enter the circulation, and be thus brought to act, directly,\r\non the cutaneous vessels; at the same time it seems extremely probable\r\nthat such remedies may also occasion an impression on the stomach, which\r\nis sympathetically communicated to the vessels of the skin; they have\r\nundoubtedly little or no influence on the general vascular system, and\r\nneither augment the force nor the velocity of the circulating current.\r\n\r\nIt is not, however, in febrile affections alone that this class of\r\nremedies proves highly beneficial; the very intimate sympathetic\r\nconnection which subsists between the functions of the lungs and skins,\r\nrenders the use of such medicines particularly advantageous in the cure\r\nof the diseases incident to the former of these organs; a fact upon\r\nwhich we shall hereafter offer some remarks under the history of\r\n_Expectorants_.\r\n\r\nSo again, in the treatment of bowel affections, in consequence of the\r\nintimate relation which exists between the cutaneous capillaries and\r\nthose of the internal organs, gentle diaphoretics offer a valuable\r\nresource in their cure. How frequently do Diarrhæa, Enteritis, &c. ensue\r\nfrom the sudden suppression of perspiration by cold?\r\n\r\nFrom the influence which these medicines exert upon the extreme vessels\r\nof the skin, they are also highly serviceable in various obstinate\r\ncutaneous affections, as _Herpes_, _Lepra_, &c.\r\n\r\nAs evacuating the serous part of the blood must necessarily have an\r\nindirect effect in promoting absorption, _Sudorifics_ have been\r\noccasionally exhibited in Dropsy, especially in that form of the disease\r\ncalled _Anasarca_. It has been already observed that cases too\r\nfrequently occur in which the discharge of urine cannot be increased by\r\nart; upon such occasions practitioners have sometimes had recourse to a\r\ntrial of Sudorifics,[165] but from the great difficulty which generally\r\nexists in exciting sweating in such affections, the indication has\r\nrarely been fulfilled. Where however a sudorific does succeed, it is\r\nless liable to debilitate than the other alternative of a drastic\r\npurgative.\r\n\r\nThere is still another point of view in which the therapeutic importance\r\nof Diaphoretics may be considered. It is generally acknowledged that by\r\ncutaneous transpiration a portion of excrementitious matter is ejected\r\nfrom the system; hence by the failure or imperfect performance of this\r\nfunction, a deleterious fluid is retained which may give origin to\r\ndisease; to such a cause may perhaps be attributed the generation of\r\nCalculi, and other diseases of the urinary system, as we shall have\r\noccasion to notice under the head of _Lithonthryptics_.\r\n\r\nThe increased efficacy which these medicines derive from combination\r\nwith each other, will form a subject of interesting enquiry in the\r\nsucceeding essay.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             EXPECTORANTS.\r\n\r\nMedicines which are supposed to be capable of facilitating the excretion\r\nof mucus from the breast, _ex pectore_, that is, from the trachea, and\r\ncells and passages of the lungs.\r\n\r\nIf the term _Expectorant_ be intended to express a medicinal substance\r\nwhich has the power of promoting the expulsion of fluid from the lungs,\r\nby some _specific action_ on the parts concerned, we can have no\r\nhesitation in at once rejecting the word, and denying the existence of\r\nsuch remedies: if, however the term be received, conventionally, as\r\ncomprehending all those substances which are capable, according to the\r\nstate of the system in each particular case, of producing expectoration,\r\nit will be extremely proper to recognise, and practically useful to\r\nretain, such a class of medicinal agents. In order that their _modus\r\noperandi_ may be correctly understood, the following classification is\r\nsubmitted to the reader.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                   A CLASSIFICATION OF EXPECTORANTS,\r\n\r\n            According to their supposed Modes of Operation.\r\n\r\n  CL: I—MEDICINES WHICH INCREASE PULMONARY EXHALATION, AND THEREBY\r\n      DILUTE THE MUCUS IN THE FOLLICLES OF THE LUNGS.\r\n\r\n      _a._ By removing constriction of the Pulmonary Exhalant vessels.\r\n\r\n          _Blisters._\r\n\r\n          _Venesection._\r\n\r\n          _Nauseants._\r\n\r\n      _b._ By stimulating these vessels by the _actual contact_ of a\r\n          medicinal substance.\r\n\r\n          _Allium._\r\n\r\n          _Scilla?_\r\n\r\n          _The different Balsams._\r\n\r\n          _fœtid Gums._\r\n\r\n      _c._ By stimulating the top of the trachea, and thereby increasing\r\n          the action of the exhalant vessels of the lungs, by a species\r\n          of _Contiguous Sympathy_.\r\n\r\n          _Stimulating Lozenges_, _Linctusses_, _The Inhalation of\r\n              certain vapours_, _&c._\r\n\r\n  CL: II.—MEDICINES WHICH DIMINISH THE INORDINATE FLOW OF FLUID INTO THE\r\n      LUNGS, AND RENDER THE EXPECTORATION OF THE REMAINDER MORE EASY.\r\n\r\n      _a._ By removing the debility of the Exhalants.\r\n\r\n          _Sulphate of Zinc._\r\n\r\n          _Bitter Tonics._\r\n\r\n      _b._ By increasing the power of the Absorbents.\r\n\r\n          _Digitalis._\r\n\r\n          _Nicotiana._\r\n\r\n      _c._ By determining to the skin by gentle diaphoresis.\r\n\r\n          _Tartarized Antimony._\r\n\r\n      _d._ By exciting serous discharges from the bowels.\r\n\r\n          _Saline Purgatives._\r\n\r\n  CL: III.—MEDICINES WHICH OPERATE, MECHANICALLY, IN PROMOTING THE\r\n      REJECTION OF ACCUMULATED MUCUS.\r\n\r\n      _a._ By stimulating the muscles of Respiration.\r\n\r\n          _Ammonia._\r\n\r\n      _b._ By exciting vomiting, and thereby compressing the thoracic\r\n          viscera.\r\n\r\n          _Emetics._\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OF MEDICINES WHICH INCREASE PULMONARY EXHALATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _By removing constriction of the Pulmonary Exhalant vessels._\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that, in certain states of disease, the\r\nexhalants of the lungs, like those of the skin, are affected by a\r\nspasmodic constriction, in consequence of which the usual quantity of\r\nfluid for the lubrication of these parts, is not effused, whence a train\r\nof morbid phenomena arise; this appears to happen in _Pneumonia_,\r\n_Asthma_, and certain other diseases of the pulmonary organs. In order\r\nto remove such a constriction, remedies of the Antispasmodic class may\r\nbe exhibited with advantage; nauseating doses of Tartarized Antimony, or\r\nof Ipecacuanha, are likewise calculated to fulfil the same indication,\r\nby an operation analogous to that by which Diaphoresis is produced. If\r\nthe term might be allowed we should call such remedies _Pulmonary\r\nDiaphoretics_. It is in this way that Venesection, Blisters, and other\r\nanti-phlogistic remedies, may in certain states of the lungs restore a\r\nhealthy excretion from these vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _By stimulating the Pulmonary Exhalants, by the actual contact of a\r\nmedicinal substance._\r\n\r\nThere certainly appear to be substances which enter the circulation, and\r\nare more peculiarly determined to the pulmonary vessels, since their\r\nodour is to be distinctly recognised in the air that is expired.\r\n_Garlic_ may be adduced as an example of this kind; so penetrating is\r\nits odorous principle, that if it be only applied to the soles of the\r\nfeet it may be perceived in the breath. Such substances may stimulate\r\nthe exhalant vessels through which they pass, and by this stimulus the\r\nsecretion may be increased, and the mucus contained in the follicles\r\ndiluted, so as to be poured out in a less viscid form, and consequently\r\nin a state to be more easily brought up by expectoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c._ _By stimulating the top of the trachea, and thereby increasing the\r\nactivity of the Exhalant vessels of the lungs, by a species of\r\ncontiguous sympathy._\r\n\r\nThe salutary operation of those various remedies, which are allowed to\r\npass slowly over the fauces, sufficiently establish the fact which is\r\nhere announced. In this manner I apprehend that much benefit may arise\r\nfrom the use of a _Linctus_, and I am satisfied from experience that\r\ncertain cases of hoarseness are to be frequently removed by such an\r\napplication of stimulating syrups.\r\n\r\nThe inhalation of certain vapours will also enable us to make a more\r\ndirect application to these parts; as, however, it is my intention to\r\ndedicate a chapter to the consideration of this form of remedy, it is\r\nunnecessary to dwell upon it in this place.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. OF MEDICINES WHICH DIMINISH THE INORDINATE FLOW OF FLUID INTO THE\r\n                                 LUNGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _By removing the debility of the Exhalants._\r\n\r\nIt not unfrequently occurs in persons either debilitated by age or\r\ndisease, that the exhalant vessels of the lungs lose their tone, and\r\npour out a larger quantity of fluid than is necessary for the\r\nlubrication of these organs; this is particularly observable in the\r\ndisease called _humoral asthma_, and in the catarrh of old persons: if\r\nthis excess be restrained by strengthening the tone of the system\r\ngenerally, or by astringing these vessels in particular, the\r\nexpectoration of the remainder will be rendered much more easy.\r\nAccording to my experience, _sulphate of zinc_ displays considerable\r\npowers in moderating this effusion of fluid, and it appears to produce\r\nthis effect by increasing the tone of the exhalant vessels of the lungs;\r\nseveral medicines also, which are included in the former division of\r\nthis classification, may, by stimulating these organs, not only promote\r\nthe exhalation when it is too scanty, but repress it when it is too\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _By increasing the power of the Absorbents._\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the mucous inundation may not depend upon any fault in\r\nthe exhalants, but upon a torpid state of the pulmonary absorbents: our\r\nremedy for this evil is to be found amongst that class of medicines\r\nwhich have the power of promoting absorption, as small doses of some\r\nmercurial preparation, _Digitalis_, and perhaps _Nicotiana_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n_c._ _By determining to the skin by a gentle diaphoresis._\r\n\r\nIt is evident that an increase of the cutaneous exhalation is generally\r\nattended with a relative diminution in the other serous excretions of\r\nbody; this is so obvious with respect to our urinary discharge, that\r\nevery person must have noticed the variation of its quantity at\r\ndifferent seasons of the year: in like manner the exhalation from the\r\nlungs, although less capable of becoming an object of observation, is\r\nnot less affected by the state of the cutaneous discharge; hence\r\nmedicines capable of promoting it, are calculated to diminish the\r\nquantity of serous exhalation from the lungs; and it is upon this\r\nprinciple, that well regulated doses of the compound powder of\r\nIpecacuan], frequently furnish the oppressed asthmatic with a valuable\r\nresource.\r\n\r\n\r\n_d._ _By exciting serous discharges from the bowels._\r\n\r\nUpon the principle announced in the preceding section, the operation of\r\na saline cathartic may relieve the pulmonary organs when loaded with a\r\npreternatural accumulation of fluid, and consequently assist\r\nexpectoration. On the contrary, if the exhalation be deficient, this\r\nclass of remedies may increase pulmonary irritation, and check\r\nexpectoration, a fact which coincides with the concurrent testimony of\r\nmany able practitioners.\r\n\r\n\r\n            III. OF MEDICINES WHICH OPERATE _mechanically_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_a._ _By imparting vigour to the respiratory muscles, engaged in the act\r\nof expectorating._\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, to a certain extent, expectoration is a\r\nvoluntary operation, connected with the action of a variety of muscles,\r\nwhich in a state of extreme debility are not easily excited into action:\r\nevery practitioner must have noticed this fact during the treatment of\r\nthe coughs of exhausted patients, and have witnessed the distress\r\nnecessarily arising from it; in this condition, the exhibition of a\r\nstimulant may so far renew the exhausted excitability of these organs,\r\nas to enable them to undergo the necessary exertions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _By compressing the thoracic viscera, through the operation of an\r\nemetic._\r\n\r\nThe beneficial results which frequently attend the concussion of an\r\nemetic, in cases of mucous accumulations in the lungs, are too well\r\nknown and understood to require much elucidation: in the act of vomiting\r\nthe thoracic viscera are violently compressed, the neighbouring muscles\r\nare also called into strong action, and both expiration and inspiration\r\nare thus rendered more forcible, and the expulsion of mucus from the\r\ncavity of the lungs necessarily accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe safety and expediency of such a resource must, however, in each\r\nparticular case be left to the discretion of the medical practitioner.\r\n\r\nBesides the remedies above enumerated, there are some others which\r\nafford relief in certain coughs, and have therefore in popular medicine,\r\nbeen considered as _Expectorants_; but their operation, if they exert\r\nany, is to be explained upon principles altogether different from that\r\nof facilitating expectoration, and will more properly fall under the\r\nhead of _Demulcents_.\r\n\r\nAtmospheric changes, in relation to moisture and dryness, deserve some\r\nnotice before we conclude the history of expectorant agents: the subject\r\nteems with curious and important facts, and the advantages which the\r\nasthmatic patient derives from such changes merit farther investigation.\r\nThat the lungs are constantly giving off aqueous vapour is made evident\r\nby condensing the expired air on a cold surface of glass or metal; and\r\nit is easy to imagine that when the atmosphere is saturated with\r\nmoisture, its power of conducting off this vapour will be proportionably\r\ndiminished, and that an accumulation of fluid may thus take place in the\r\nlungs; on the other hand, we may suppose the air to be so dry as to have\r\nan increased capacity for moisture, and to carry off the expired vapour\r\nwith preternatural avidity; in either of these cases, the excretions\r\nfrom the lungs will be materially influenced, whether to the benefit or\r\ndisadvantage of the patient will depend, in each particular instance,\r\nupon the nature of the disease under which he suffers. I have known a\r\nperson who could breathe with more freedom in the thick fogs of the\r\nmetropolis than in the pure air of a mountainous region, and it would\r\nnot be difficult to adduce many examples in illustration of a\r\ndiametrically opposite constitution of the pulmonary organs.\r\n\r\nFrom the same cause we may frequently observe remarkable changes occur\r\nin the character of a cough, at the breaking up of a frost; in some\r\ncases the expectoration will be checked, and in others promoted by a\r\nsudden change from a dry to a moist atmosphere. Can a more instructive\r\nillustration be offered of that important fact, which I have been\r\nlabouring in every page to impress upon the mind of the young\r\npractitioner, that, _remedies are only relative agents_?\r\n\r\nIn the course of considerable experience in the treatment of pulmonary\r\ncomplaints, and in the influence of climate and seasons upon them, I\r\nhave repeatedly observed the rapid transition from moisture to dryness\r\nto occasion very remarkable effects upon the disease; and I much\r\nquestion whether an attention to such a condition of the atmosphere does\r\nnot deserve as much consideration in the election of a suitable place of\r\nresidence for such invalids, as the more obvious circumstance of\r\ntemperature. I have been long in the habit of recommending to persons\r\nconfined in artificially warmed apartments, to evaporate a certain\r\nportion of water, whenever the external air has become excessively dry\r\nby the prevalence of the north-east winds, which so frequently infest\r\nthis island during the months of Spring; and the most marked advantage\r\nhas attended the practice. But in such cases the practitioner must ever\r\nbe guided by the symptoms of each particular case; it would be worse\r\nthan useless to lay down any general precept for his guidance. We cannot\r\nthen be surprised that such a difference of opinion should exist amongst\r\npractitioners of equal eminence, respecting the influence of a marine\r\natmosphere; some advocating its advantages to the pulmonary invalid, and\r\nothers maintaining with equal confidence the injurious tendency of such\r\nlocalities; each party appeals to _experience_ in justification of his\r\nopinion, and with equal candour and justice; but the cases from the\r\nresults of which the medical inference has been drawn, however parallel\r\nthey may have appeared, differed in those essential points to which we\r\nhave alluded, and upon which the question of climate would seem to turn.\r\nThere is another circumstance connected with the subject of atmospheric\r\nmoisture which it is also essential to remember,—that the air gains a\r\nconsiderable increase in its power of conducting caloric, by becoming\r\nsaturated with aqueous vapour; thus, when a thaw takes place, and the\r\nthermometer rises a few degrees above 32°, the air, instead of\r\nimpressing us with the sensation of increased temperature, actually\r\nappears much colder.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              SIALOGOGUES;\r\n\r\nSubstances which increase the salivary[166] discharge. This class\r\ncomprehends two orders of medicines, viz.\r\n\r\n1st. Those which increase the salivary excretion by _external_\r\napplication to the secreting vessels, by mastication, as the following\r\nacrimonious and pungent substances, _Anthemis Pyrethrum_; _Colchearia\r\nArmoracia_; _Daphne Mezereum_; _Nicotiana Tabacum_, &c.\r\n\r\n2nd. Those whose _internal_ exhibition affects these organs through the\r\nmedium of the circulation, of which _Mercury_ is the only true example;\r\nfor all the preparations of this metal, when administered in certain\r\nquantities, produce salivation.\r\n\r\nThe acrid Sialogogues, or Masticatories, by stimulating the excretory\r\nducts, and increasing the secretion of saliva, sometimes relieve the\r\npain of tooth-ache, and are commonly resorted to for that purpose; they\r\nare besides supposed capable of relieving other congestions, or\r\ninflammatory dispositions, in remote parts of the head, by the\r\nderivation they occasion from the neighbouring vessels, especially the\r\nbranches of the external carotid.\r\n\r\nMercury, in its metallic state,[167] is perfectly inert, and does not\r\nexert any influence whatever upon the living body: this fact is\r\nsufficient, if any serious refutation were necessary, to overturn the\r\ntheory which attributes its sialogogue property to the gravity of its\r\nparticles, by which “it is disposed to retain the _direct line_ in which\r\nit is propelled from the heart, and is therefore more certainly\r\ndetermined to the vessels of the head.” It has been also supposed to act\r\nby diminishing the _lentor_ of the blood, and disposing it to pass more\r\neasily into the salivary glands, so as to increase their secretion:\r\nequally gratuitous and improbable are the chemical hypothesis which have\r\nbeen offered to explain this curious and singular property; Dr. Cullen\r\nendeavoured to solve the problem, by supposing that “_Mercury has a\r\nparticular disposition to unite with ammoniacal salts, and that such\r\nsalts are disposed to pass off by the salivary glands more copiously\r\nthan by any other excretion_.” Dr. Murray, however, very justly remarks\r\nthat mercury has not any peculiar tendency of this kind; and that if it\r\nhad, these salts are not more abundant in the saliva, than in some other\r\nsecretions. Dr. Murray then proceeds to submit a theory which he\r\nconsiders better calculated to explain the phenomenon; he observes, that\r\nthe urine appears more peculiarly designed to convey matter which has\r\nbeen received into the circulating mass, but which is still\r\nexcrementitious, from the system. To pass, however, with this fluid, it\r\nis necessary that the matter conveyed should be soluble in it; and when\r\nit is so, we can discover it in the secretion by chemical tests. If\r\nthere is any property connected with it, therefore, which shall prevent\r\nthis solubility, it probably will prevent the substance from being\r\nsecreted. Now, the _phosphoric acid_, abundant in urine, must in this\r\nmode counteract the secretion of mercury in any form of preparation, by\r\nforming with it a compound, insoluble, and to which the slight excess of\r\nacid cannot communicate solubility; the mercury, therefore, existing in\r\nthe circulating mass, when brought in the course of the circulation to\r\nthe secreting vessels of the kidneys, will not pass through their whole\r\ncourse; but if conveyed so far as to be combined with _phosphoric acid_,\r\nwill, from this combination, be incapable of being conveyed onwards, and\r\nwill therefore be retained in the composition of that part of the blood\r\nwhich does not enter into the secretion, but returns into the\r\ncirculation. It must be discharged by some other emunctory; a portion of\r\nit appears, from some facts, to pass off by the insensible perspiration;\r\nbut the _tenuity_ of this secretion, if the term may be employed, must\r\nbe unfavourable to this mode of discharge. The salivary secretion is one\r\nby which it may be more easily transmitted; and this transmission may\r\neven be facilitated by the affinity exerted to the _Oxide of Mercury_ by\r\nthe _Muriatic Acid_, the _Soda_, and _Ammonia_, which are the chief\r\nsaline ingredients in saliva; for it deserves to be remarked that triple\r\ncompounds of these substances are, to a certain extent, soluble in\r\nwater; and if the _Mercury_ is thus secreted, it will of course\r\nstimulate the secreting vessels through which it passes, and increase\r\nthe discharge.\r\n\r\nSir Gilbert Blane[168] has lately advanced another hypothesis to account\r\nfor the effects of mercury as a sialogogue; he considers the salivary\r\nglands as one of the outlets for the _ramenta_ of the bones, for by\r\nanalysing the saliva we discover the principles of which they consist;\r\nindeed the osseous matter not unfrequently concretes on the teeth, and\r\nsometimes on the salivary ducts, in the form of what is called _Tartar:_\r\n“does not this fact,” says Sir Gilbert Blane, “in some measure account\r\nfor these glands being the parts upon which determination is made by the\r\noperation of mercury, which consists in exciting an active absorption of\r\nsolid parts, as I have elsewhere observed?”[169]\r\n\r\nBut do not the kidneys, and other excretory glands also furnish outlets,\r\nthrough which the _detritus_ of the body is eliminated. How does it\r\nhappen, therefore, that the kidneys are not as equally affected as the\r\nsalivary glands by the action of mercury? In the present state of our\r\nknowledge it will be more prudent to rest on the phenomenon as an\r\nultimate fact, than in attempting to ascend higher in the scale of\r\ncauses, to involve ourselves in impenetrable darkness.\r\n\r\nDuring the prevalence of the theory which attributed to _Nitric acid_\r\nall the antisyphilitic powers of mercury, it was even maintained that\r\nthis acid also excited ptyalism; experience however has disproved the\r\neffects thus attributed to it, and no one attempts to support its\r\npretensions, as a sialogogue, except indeed as it may perchance, by its\r\nacrid qualities, influence the excretory ducts of the glands,\r\nexternally, in the act of being swallowed.\r\n\r\nIt has very lately been stated by Dr. Macleod,[170] that the\r\n_Hydro-cyanic acid_ occasionally produces soreness of the gums, and a\r\ndisposition to ptyalism; this, if true, is a very remarkable fact, and\r\nwell deserves attentive consideration.\r\n\r\nSome theorists may, perhaps, be inclined to consider certain Nauseating\r\nMedicines as possessing sialogogue properties. It cannot be denied that\r\nan increased discharge of saliva will take place during the operation of\r\nsuch remedies, but it is very transient, and can never be rendered\r\navailable to any therapeutic object. I shall however have occasion to\r\nrefer to this fact hereafter, and to the inference deduced from it by\r\nDr. Eberle, in explanation of the effect of nauseating medicines in\r\npromoting the operation of Mercury.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ERRHINES, or STERNUTATORIES:\r\n\r\nSubstances which, by direct application to the pituitary membrane,\r\noccasion a discharge from the nostrils either of a mucous or serous\r\nfluid. This class contains several different species, whose operation\r\nvaries in intensity, as well as in duration.\r\n\r\nErrhines have been regarded as useful in consequence of the evacuation\r\nthey occasion, but in this respect their value has been greatly\r\nover-rated; it has been stated, that they diminish the quantity of fluid\r\ncirculating in the neighbouring vessels, and even extend their influence\r\nto all the branches of the external carotid; and Dr. Cullen says that he\r\nhas, apparently from this operation, known head-ache, pain of the ear,\r\nand some cases of ophthalmia, cured or relieved by the use of Errhines.\r\nThere can be no doubt that local stimulants of this kind will frequently\r\nremove pain from the head and neighbouring parts, but not merely by\r\noccasioning vascular depletion, as Dr. Cullen supposed, but by a\r\nstimulant operation conveyed through the medium of nervous\r\ncommunication, or contiguous sympathy.\r\n\r\nDr. Cullen has moreover supposed, that these substances may be useful in\r\npreventing apoplexy or palsy. Morgagni[171] however relates a case in\r\nwhich sneezing induced a fatal attack of this disease; and Van\r\nSwieten[172] has satisfactorily shewn, that continued paroxysms of\r\nsneezing tend to load the vessels of the head with blood; for the\r\nviolent contraction of the chest impedes, for a time, the passage of the\r\nblood through the lungs, and therefore obstructs the return of the\r\nvenous blood from the brain, the vessels of which are in consequence\r\ngreatly distended; the face therefore reddens and becomes turgid, the\r\neyes are suffused with water, and appear full and distended. Its\r\noccasional dangerous violence is said to have given origin to the\r\nbenediction so universally bestowed on those who sneeze.[173]\r\n\r\nIt has been a subject of popular inquiry, how far the habitual use of\r\nSnuff may prove beneficial or injurious; and whether the habit, when\r\nonce fully established, can be discontinued with impunity? It may be\r\nremarked that Snuff, by habitual use, soon ceases to produce the effect\r\nof an Errhine, for which reason its discontinuance cannot, generally, be\r\nregarded as likely to be attended with any danger; in those cases,\r\nhowever, in which the discharge is perpetuated, a contrary judgment\r\nshould be pronounced, for all artificial discharges become\r\nconstitutional by long continuance, and can therefore be seldom checked\r\nwith impunity. Dr. Cullen states, from experience, that “whenever the\r\nnasal discharge has been considerable, the laying aside the custom of\r\ntaking snuff has been productive of evil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                EPISPASTICS. _Vesicatories._ _Blisters._\r\n\r\nExternal applications to the skin, which produce a serous or puriform\r\ndischarge, by previously exciting a high state of inflammation.\r\n\r\nWhen these agents act so mildly as merely to excite inflammation,\r\nwithout occasioning the effusion of serum, they are denominated\r\nRUBEFACIENTS.\r\n\r\nVarious substances have at different times, been proposed for the\r\naccomplishment of this object,—such as _Nitric Acid_, _Boiling Water_,\r\n_Strong Acetic Acid_, _Tartarized Antimony_, &c. It is, however,\r\ngenerally admitted, that no substance ever employed equals in efficacy,\r\nor certainty, the _Cantharis Vesicatoria_, the common blistering, or\r\nSpanish fly; and whose effects may serve to illustrate the _modus\r\noperandi_ of this class of remedies.\r\n\r\nBy the application of a _Blister_, the extreme blood vessels are excited\r\ninto increased action, by which inflammation is occasioned, and the\r\nexhalants made to pour out a thin serous fluid which separates the\r\ncuticle from the true skin, and forms a vesicle or blister.\r\n\r\nFrom this simple view of the subject it will appear evident, that\r\nblisters may produce their salutary effects by several different modes\r\nof operation; by a just estimate of which the practitioner will be\r\nenabled to reconcile the discordant opinions which have been delivered\r\nupon the subject, and to employ these agents with greater satisfaction\r\nand advantage.\r\n\r\nBlisters may act—\r\n\r\n  1. AS DERIVATIVES, i. e. _by producing a derivation of the circulation\r\n      from the inflamed and engorged vessels of the neighbouring organs\r\n      to the blistered surface_. This mode of operation was long\r\n      overlooked by the physicians, who ascribed all the beneficial\r\n      effects of a blister to the evacuation which it produced, while\r\n      the humoral pathologist, moreover, considered the matter so\r\n      discharged to be of a morbific nature. That such agents owe their\r\n      salutary tendency to causes independent of their powers as\r\n      evacuants, is at once rendered evident by the relief which they\r\n      afford, when used only as Rubefacients.\r\n\r\n  2. AS EVACUANTS—_by occasioning an effusion of Fluids_. In this case\r\n      the vesicated part may be considered in the light of a new\r\n      excretory organ, the formation of which requires the establishment\r\n      of a new current or determination of blood; so long as the\r\n      discharge continues, so long will there be an especial demand of\r\n      blood in the blistered part, and a consequent derivation of the\r\n      circulation from the inflamed and engorged vessels of the\r\n      neighbouring organs.[174] The nature of the fluid effused is at\r\n      first serous, but after some time it becomes purulent, and this\r\n      stage of its operation must be considered as, by far, the most\r\n      beneficial; hence the great advantages derived from a “_perpetual\r\n      blister_.”\r\n\r\n  3. AS GENERAL STIMULANTS, _by raising the vigour of the\r\n      circulation_.[175] That Blisters have such a tendency there exist\r\n      too many proofs to allow us to doubt. Hence in fevers they\r\n      frequently prove valuable auxiliaries, but since the application\r\n      of any stimulus, in such diseases, must be regulated by the degree\r\n      of excitement, it is evident that they can only be made with\r\n      success in particular stages; this simple fact will at once\r\n      explain the cause of that want of unanimity in Physicians with\r\n      respect to the value of blisters in febrile diseases. Rush\r\n      considered that there was one particular period, in the course of\r\n      a continued fever, intermediate between its stage of high\r\n      excitement and the appearance of a collapse, in which blisters\r\n      will generally produce unequivocal good effects, and to this he\r\n      gave the name of the _Blistering point_.\r\n\r\n  4. AS ANTISPASMODICS.—_Relieving pain through the medium of Contiguous\r\n      Sympathy._ This effect would frequently appear to be independent\r\n      of the operations above enumerated; a similar principle seems to\r\n      exist with regard to the _pain_ excited by blisters, which may\r\n      also be applied to the explanation of the advantages derived from\r\n      them in several diseases. It has long been remarked that, by\r\n      exciting one pain we may often relieve another, and hence blisters\r\n      afford relief in tooth-ache, and other painful affections.\r\n      Epilepsy and Hysteria, arising from irritation, have been removed\r\n      by such applications, apparently from their exciting powers.\r\n\r\nIt remains for us to make a few observations upon the abuse of these\r\nremedies, for, notwithstanding the popular adage that “_Blisters are\r\nalways safe things_,” that “_if they do no good, they can do no harm_,”\r\nthey will be found, like all other potent applications, capable of\r\nproducing much mischief when directed by unskilful hands. In stages of\r\nhigh vascular excitement in the pulmonary organs, blisters have\r\nincreased the irritation they were designed to allay, and in some cases\r\nhave promoted a tendency to effusion; in the treatment of acute\r\nHydrocephalus the common practice of blistering the head appears very\r\nquestionable, and has too often, I am well persuaded, accelerated the\r\nfatal termination, by increasing the disposition to serous effusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ISSUES (_Fonticuli_) and SETONS (_Setacea_[176]).\r\n\r\nThe effects of these processes bear a strong analogy to those which are\r\nproduced by Vesicatories; they are, however, more permanent, and are on\r\nthat account better adapted to the relief of those chronic affections\r\nwhich would seem to require a remedy of long continued influence. In\r\npulmonary affections, for instance, a seton in the side is frequently\r\nattended with very considerable benefit. The popular belief in humoral\r\npathology, which continues to influence the mass of mankind, has perhaps\r\nassigned to these remedies a greater share of credit than that to which\r\nthey are really entitled, but it must still be acknowledged that when an\r\nulcer having existed a great length of time, is healed or _dried up_, or\r\nany constitutional discharge is suddenly checked, the health may become\r\naffected. In such cases the establishing a discharge by means of an\r\nIssue is undoubtedly a safe, and often a beneficial operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       III. OF CHEMICAL REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nThere is no principle in physiology better established than that which\r\nconsiders vitality as a power engaged in continual conflict with the\r\nphysical, chemical, and mechanical laws, to which every species of\r\ninanimate matter is invariably subject. Every phenomenon of the living\r\nbody might be advanced in illustration and support of this general\r\nposition. The animal machine is constantly surrounded and assailed by\r\nagents, whose elective attractions for the principles of which it\r\nconsists, are so numerous and energetic, that its decomposition would\r\ninevitably and speedily result, were not the adhesion of its molecules\r\nmaintained by the conservative influence of a superior power. The\r\ncompositions and decompositions which manifest themselves in the\r\nelaborate operations of chylification, sanguification, and secretion,\r\nare carried on by agencies totally distinct from those which govern the\r\ncombinations of inert matter, and must be investigated upon principles\r\nessentially different. How then, it may be asked, can a medicinal\r\nsubstance be brought to act _chemically_ upon the _living_ body?\r\nNotwithstanding the general proposition, that the animal processes to\r\nwhich we have alluded, are governed by laws peculiar to life, yet it\r\nmust be admitted that such processes are occasionally influenced,[177]\r\nmodified, and controlled by powers strictly chemical in their operation;\r\nalthough in some cases it will be seen that such effects afford only\r\napparent exceptions to the general law: for several of the remedies\r\nwhose operations have been regarded as purely chemical, exert their\r\ninfluence on parts which cannot be strictly considered under the control\r\nof the living principle; of which _Antacids_, and certain _Antidotes_\r\nand _Antiseptics_, to be hereafter explained, may be considered as\r\nexamples: in like manner will cataplasms of acetic acid hasten the\r\nexfoliation of carious bone; a practice which has lately been employed\r\nwith much success in the Infirmary at Gloucester. Upon the same\r\nprinciple alkaline applications may be made to dissolve coagulated\r\nblood; suppose, for the sake of illustration, that the bladder should\r\nbecome filled with coagulum through hemorrhage from the prostate gland,\r\nand that the most serious consequences were to be apprehended from the\r\ndistention; in such an emergency, a dilute and tepid solution of potass,\r\nif injected through the catheter, might prove eminently serviceable;\r\nalthough such a practice would require the utmost skill for its safe\r\ndirection, since the removal of the plug, thus afforded by Nature to the\r\nbleeding vessel, might be followed by an immediate return of active\r\nhemorrhage. On the contrary, other agents destroy the vitality of the\r\norgan before they can produce any change in the matter of which it is\r\ncomposed, as the action of _Escharotics_ will clearly demonstrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             REFRIGERANTS.\r\n\r\nSubstances which directly diminish the force of the circulation, and\r\nreduce the heat of the body, without occasioning any diminution of\r\nsensibility or nervous energy.\r\n\r\nThese remedies may be considered either as external and local, or as\r\ninternal and general. In the first case, there will not be much\r\ndifficulty in substantiating their claims to be considered _Chemical\r\nAgents_, but in the latter case, the theory of their operation is\r\nunsatisfactory and obscure; and even the facts which are adduced to\r\nestablish the existence of such a class of remedies, are of a very\r\nproblematical character.\r\n\r\nTOPICAL REFRIGERANTS. In the case of external inflammation,\r\nrefrigeration may be produced by the application of cold substances,\r\nsuch as water, ice, or certain saline solutions, or by the abstraction\r\nof heat by means of evaporation, which is very effectually accomplished\r\nby the use of lotions composed of spirit or ether. By these methods we\r\nare capable of directly diminishing the activity of the vessels of the\r\npart; thus, in burns and scalds, the pain is instantly relieved, and the\r\ninflammation effectually reduced.\r\n\r\nINTERNAL REFRIGERANTS. There are certain saline substances which, by\r\nundergoing a rapid solution, and acquiring an increased capacity for\r\ncaloric, produce a diminution of temperature, and if this takes place in\r\nthe stomach, the sensation of cold which it will produce is equivalent\r\nto a partial abstraction of stimulus; which, being extended by sympathy\r\nto the heart, occasions a transient reduction in the force of the\r\ncirculation, and by this, or by a similar sympathetic affection, causes\r\na sensation of cold over the whole body; in this manner Dr. Murray\r\nexplains the refrigerant operation of nitre, which after all is of a\r\nvery doubtful nature. We shall perhaps not feel much difficulty in\r\naccepting this theory, and in allowing that general refrigerant effects\r\nmay be temporarily produced, by occasioning an impression of cold upon\r\nthe stomach. The theory which is proposed to explain the refrigerant\r\noperation of vegetable acids and certain other substances, and which we\r\nhave now to consider, is derived from those chemical views respecting\r\nanimal heat, in which the consumption of oxygen in the act of\r\nrespiration is considered the principal source. Dr. Murray,[178] who has\r\ngiven a luminous exposition of this theory, says “it is established by\r\nnumerous experiments and observations, that the quantity of oxygen\r\nconsumed in the lungs is materially influenced by the nature of the\r\ningesta received into the stomach. When the food and drink are composed\r\nof substances which contain a small proportion of oxygen, it is known\r\nthat the consumption of oxygen in the lungs is increased, and this even\r\nin a short time after the aliment has been received; thus Mr. Spalding,\r\nthe celebrated diver, observed, that whenever he used a diet of animal\r\nfood, or drank spirituous liquors, he consumed in a much shorter time\r\nthe oxygen of the atmospheric air in his diving-bell; and therefore he\r\nhad learned from experience to confine himself to a vegetable diet, and\r\nto water for drink, when following his profession.”[179] During\r\ndigestion too, it was established by the experiments of Lavoisier and\r\nSeguin, that a larger proportion of oxygen than usual is consumed.\r\n\r\nBut it is known, that the animal temperature is derived from the\r\nconsumption of oxygen gas by respiration; and, that an increase in that\r\nconsumption will occasion a greater evolution of caloric in the system,\r\nand consequently an increase of temperature in the body, while a\r\ndiminution in the consumption of oxygen will have an opposite effect.\r\nIf, then, when the temperature of the body is morbidly increased, we\r\nintroduce into the stomach substances containing a large proportion of\r\noxygen, especially in a loose state of combination, we may succeed in\r\nreducing the general temperature. This we accomplish in part by a\r\nvegetable diet, but still more effectually by the free use of the\r\n_Acids_. The vegetable acids in particular, which are found by\r\nexperience to be the best refrigerants, are readily acted upon by the\r\ndigestive powers, and assimilated with the food; and as the large\r\nquantity of oxygen which they contain is already in a concrete state,\r\nlittle sensible heat can be produced by the combination of that element\r\nwith the other principles of the food. The nutritious matter which is\r\nreceived into the blood, containing thus a larger proportion of oxygen\r\nthan usual, will be disposed to abstract less of it from the air in the\r\nlungs, and consequently less caloric will be evolved; the temperature of\r\nthe body will be reduced; and this, again operating as a reduction of\r\nstimulus, will lessen the number and force of the contractions of the\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nSuch is the philosophical web which chemical ingenuity has wove for\r\nus,—the device is beautiful, but the fabric will be found too frail to\r\nendure the touch. The experiments of Dr. Crawford, in proof of the\r\nchemical origin of animal heat, are highly ingenious and plausible, but\r\nit is now generally admitted that the temperature of animals depends\r\nupon the living principle[180] which animates them, and that although\r\nthe absorption of oxygen, in the act of respiration, may directly\r\ncontribute something to its production, yet that its chief action is\r\nthat of serving as a stimulus to the living power in generating it; for,\r\nas Sir Gilbert Blane[181] remarks, oxygen plays an interesting and\r\nactive part as an exciting power throughout all nature, both animate and\r\ninanimate. If the heat of the body depended on respiration alone, any\r\none might, by a voluntary effort of quick, deep, and prolonged\r\nrespiration, increase the temperature of his body at will; the effect\r\nalso of the emotions of the mind, in generating both heat and cold, adds\r\nSir Gilbert, is proof sufficient of temperature depending on a vital,\r\nand not on a chemical cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ANTACIDS:\r\n\r\nRemedies which obviate acidity in the stomach, by combining with the\r\nacid, and neutralizing it.\r\n\r\nThis is the most decided instance of chemical action which occurs in the\r\nhistory of medicinal operations. We have an acid whose presence excites\r\nmorbid symptoms in the _primæ viæ_, and these are immediately removed by\r\nthe administration of any one of those substances which are capable of\r\nforming a natural compound with the acid in question, _out of the body_,\r\nand the same proportions are required in both cases for saturation. If a\r\ncarbonated alkali be employed, the same disengagement of carbonic acid\r\ntakes place in the stomach as would occur in the laboratory, and a new\r\ncompound is produced, whose operation varies according to the chemical\r\nnature of the substance employed; thus, the salt which magnesia forms\r\nwith the acid in the stomach proves slightly purgative, while that which\r\nlime produces under similar circumstances is distinguished by an\r\nopposite property.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    ANTILITHICS AND LITHONTHRYPTICS.\r\n\r\nANTILITHICS[182] are remedies which have the power of preventing the\r\nformation of those mechanical deposites from the urine, which give\r\norigin to calculous concretions; and may belong either to the class of\r\nVital, or Chemical Agents.\r\n\r\nLITHONTHRYPTICS[183] are those medicines which, by a chemical operation,\r\nare capable of dissolving calculous concretions.\r\n\r\nIt has been already shewn, while treating the subject of Diuretics, that\r\ncertain substances, when internally administered, are capable of passing\r\nthe barriers of digestion, and of entering the circulation; and that,\r\nmoreover, these bodies may be again separated by the secretory vessels\r\nof the kidneys, and be ejected from the body in the urine. It cannot\r\ntherefore be contended, that the urinary calculus is placed beyond the\r\nsphere of direct medicinal influence, nor can any argument, founded upon\r\nthe alleged incompatibility of chemical and vital action, be fairly\r\nmaintained in this case; for the urinary calculus, as well as the urine\r\nitself,[184] may very justly be considered as extraneous to the living\r\nbody. The existence of such a class of remedies as that of\r\nLithonthryptics being thus established, we have to consider the mode and\r\npossible extent of their operation in the different varieties of the\r\ndisease, which they are thus calculated to palliate or cure. In entering\r\nupon this inquiry, it is not my intention to prosecute the subject\r\nfarther than may be necessary to explain the _modus operandi_ of the\r\nremedies in question, and in conformity with the object and plan of this\r\nwork, to establish some general principles that are to direct us in\r\ntheir election, combination, and administration; for farther details the\r\npractitioner must consult the systematic treatises of _Prout_[185] and\r\n_Marcet_,[186] and the very able papers of Mr. _Brande_,[187] and Dr.\r\n_Wilson Philip_.[188]\r\n\r\nThe urine may be considered as one of the most heterogeneous of the\r\nanimal fluids;[189] and since a knowledge of its composition, and that\r\nof the morbid changes of which it is susceptible, must constitute the\r\nbasis of all our knowledge respecting the formation and cure of\r\ncalculous affections, the following results of an elaborate analysis by\r\n_Berzelius_, are submitted with a view to elucidate our pathological\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\n _Animal Principles._│Water                                       933·00\r\n          „          │Urea                                         30·10\r\n          „          │Lithic Acid                                   1·00\r\n          „          │Pure Lactic Acid, Lactate of Ammonia, and\r\n                     │  Animal matters not separable from these    17·14\r\n          „          │Mucus of the Bladder                           ·32\r\n\r\n _Alkaline and Earthy│Sulphate of Potass\r\n   Salts._           │                                              3·71\r\n          „          │Sulphate of Soda                              3·16\r\n          „          │Phosphate of Soda                             2·94\r\n          „          │Phosphate of Ammonia                          1·65\r\n          „          │Muriate of Soda                               4·45\r\n          „          │Muriate of Ammonia                            1·50\r\n          „          │Earthy Phosphates with a trace of Fluate\r\n                     │  of Lime                                     1·00\r\n          „          │Silex                                          ·03\r\n                                                                 ———————\r\n                                                                 1000·00\r\n                                                                 ———————\r\n\r\nBesides the above ingredients, which appear to be essential to healthy\r\nurine, Dr. Prout observes that in different diseases it may contain\r\nAlbumen, Fibrin, and the red particles of the blood; Nitric acid;\r\nvarious acids, which are found to be modifications of the Lithic; Oxalic\r\nacid; Benzoic acid; Carbonic acid;[190] Xanthic Oxide; Cystic Oxide;\r\nSugar; Bile; and Pus.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary in this place to make a few observations upon the\r\nnature and habitudes of those principles, which are more immediately\r\nactive in the production of calculi—\r\n\r\n  1. _Urea_ is a principle peculiar to urine, and must be regarded as a\r\n      result of the action of the kidneys upon some of the constituents\r\n      of the blood, perhaps, as Dr. Prout suggests, upon its albuminous\r\n      matter. For a long time it was regarded as the peculiar principle\r\n      upon which the colour and other sensible qualities of the urine\r\n      depended; Berzelius however has corrected this fallacy, and\r\n      considers that the Lactic acid, and its accompanying animal\r\n      matters, are the bodies which impart to this fluid the\r\n      characteristic smell and colour which distinguish it.[191]\r\n\r\n  2. _Lithic_, or _Uric[192] Acid_. As this principle is not found in\r\n      the blood, but is constantly present in healthy urine, it follows\r\n      that it must be generated by the action of the kidneys. M.\r\n      Majendie[193] has lately endeavoured to prove that its secretion\r\n      depends upon the _Azote_ received in alimentary substances, and\r\n      for the following reasons, _viz._ 1. Azote is a component part of\r\n      _Lithic Acid_[194]—2. Those persons who use a large portion of\r\n      animal food, and fermented liquors, are liable to calculous\r\n      disorders—3. When animals are confined to food which contains no\r\n      Azote, no Lithic acid is formed—but of this anon.—Berzelius and\r\n      other animal chemists have supposed that this acid exists in urine\r\n      in a free state; but Dr. Prout, whose arguments appear very\r\n      satisfactory and decisive, is of opinion that it is always in\r\n      combination with ammonia (_Lithate of Ammonia_), from which\r\n      however it is very easily separated by the addition of any acid,\r\n      even the carbonic, in the form of a red powder. It moreover\r\n      appears to be susceptible of several important modifications, with\r\n      which it behoves the pathologist to be acquainted; the profession\r\n      is greatly indebted to the ingenuity and industry of Dr. Prout for\r\n      some very essential additions to our knowledge, respecting the\r\n      habitudes of _Lithic acid_ with different bodies.\r\n\r\n  _Erythric Acid._ When nitric acid diluted with about an equal bulk of\r\n      water, is poured upon pure lithic acid, and a moderate heat is\r\n      applied, an effervescence takes place, and the lithic acid is\r\n      dissolved; if we then concentrate this solution by a gentle\r\n      evaporation, we obtain transparent colourless crystals, which have\r\n      been found to constitute a peculiar acid, to which M. Brugnatelli\r\n      has given the name of _Erythric acid_.\r\n\r\n  _Purpuric Acid._ Dr. Prout has discovered that if into a strong\r\n      solution of the above crystals in water, whilst boiling hot, we\r\n      carefully drop some pure ammonia, the solution acquires a\r\n      beautiful purple[195] colour, and crystals of _purpurate of\r\n      ammonia_ speedily begin to form and subside. If these crystals are\r\n      treated by means of potass and sulphuric acid, pure _Purpuric\r\n      acid_ is obtained in the form of a yellowish, or cream-coloured\r\n      powder.\r\n\r\n  3. _The Phosphates._ As the Phosphoric acid and its compounds perform\r\n      an important part in the generation of calculi, their origin[196]\r\n      and history demand particular attention from the chemist. The\r\n      Phosphoric acid frequently exists in the urine in a free state,\r\n      when it would appear to act, like any other acid, as a precipitant\r\n      of the Lithic acid; this however is not the circumstance that\r\n      renders its presence formidable; it is to the abundance of its\r\n      compounds that we are to look for mischief. In healthy urine the\r\n      phosphoric acid appears to exist in union with soda and ammonia,\r\n      and partly with lime and magnesia; the latter salts being retained\r\n      in solution by an excess of acid; but the proportion of these\r\n      bodies is liable to considerable variation.[197]\r\n\r\nHaving thus briefly noticed those particular points in the chemistry of\r\nthe subject with which the therapeutic principles are more immediately\r\nconnected, we shall be better prepared to examine and appreciate the\r\nseveral plans of treatment which have been proposed for the prevention,\r\ncure, or palliation of calculous disorders; and here the subject\r\nnaturally divides itself into two parts; the one comprehending the\r\n_modus operandi_ of Antilithics, or those remedies which prevent or\r\ncorrect the calculous diathesis; the other, explaining the solvent\r\naction of Lithonthryptics over concretions already formed.\r\n\r\nThe line of demarcation by which healthy and morbid urine are separated,\r\nis so slight that it is difficult to define its limits; nor would the\r\ncircumstance appear to be materially important, for the boundary is\r\ndaily exceeded, not only with impunity, but even without our\r\nconsciousness of the event; and Dr. Prout has accordingly denominated\r\nsuch occasional deviations, the “_Sediments of Health_.”\r\n\r\nThe same enlightened author considers that mechanical deposites from the\r\nurine, although composed of the same general ingredients, may, in a\r\npathological point of view, be conveniently divided into three classes,\r\nviz. _Pulverulent_ or _Amorphous Sediments_; 2. _Crystalline Sediments_,\r\nusually denominated gravel; and 3. _Solid Concretions_, or calculi\r\nformed by the aggregation of these latter sediments. The first of these\r\nmay be passed over, as unconnected with the present subject; the latter\r\nhowever constitutes an essential object of research; for a complete\r\nacquaintance with the chemical history of calculi can alone furnish the\r\ntrue indications of cure.\r\n\r\nScheele,[198] with whom the inquiry originated, conceived that every\r\ncalculus consisted of a peculiar concrete acid, soluble in alkaline\r\nlixivia, and which Morveau denominated the _Lithic Acid_; but the\r\nsubsequent researches of Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Wollaston, Pearson, Henry,\r\nBrande, Marcet, and Prout, have demonstrated the existence of _several_\r\nbodies in the composition of urinary calculi, viz. _Lithic Acid_;\r\n_Phosphate of Lime_; _Ammoniaco-magnesian Phosphate_; _Oxalate of Lime_;\r\n_Cystic Oxide_;[199] and _Xanthic Oxide_;[200] to which may be added an\r\n_animal cementing ingredient_. The varieties of calculi produced by the\r\ncombination or intermixture of these ingredients, are represented in the\r\nfollowing Tabular Arrangement.\r\n\r\n ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\r\n │     A TABULAR VIEW OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF URINARY CALCULI.     │\r\n ├───────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┤\r\n │  SPECIES OF   │    EXTERNAL     │    CHEMICAL     │    REMARKS.     │\r\n │   CALCULI.    │   CHARACTERS.   │  COMPOSITION.   │                 │\r\n ├───────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┼─────────────────┤\r\n │1.

It has been already stated,\r\nthat the lithic acid exists in the urine in combination with ammonia, so\r\nas to be held in solution under ordinary circumstances; if however any\r\nfree acid be generated, the lithic acid is immediately precipitated,\r\ngiving rise to the appearance so well known under the name of _red\r\ngravel_; from this view of the subject the lithic acid deposite must be\r\nconsidered as arising, not from the excess of that substance in the\r\nurine, but from a decomposition of the compounds into which it enters by\r\nthe agency of a free acid. M. Majendie is therefore incorrect in\r\nattributing its appearance to the quantity of azote in the ingesta; an\r\nopinion which has been very ably controverted by Dr. Philip, in a paper\r\npublished in the sixth volume of the Medical Transactions. It appears,\r\nmoreover, that whatever tends to disturb the process of digestion, by\r\nfavouring the production of acid, may be considered as the exciting\r\ncause of the lithic deposites; especially where the cutaneous functions\r\nare imperfectly performed; for Dr. Philip is of opinion, that the\r\nprecipitating acid, in a healthy state of the system, is thrown off by\r\nthe skin; and he supposes that even when generated in excess, it may be\r\ndiverted to the surface of the body by merely increasing the insensible\r\nperspiration. The medical treatment of the lithic diathesis is thus\r\nrendered simple and satisfactory; and if the opinion of Dr. Prout be\r\ntrue, that at least two-thirds of the whole number of calculi originate\r\nfrom lithic acid, the extreme importance of the subject is too apparent\r\nto require comment. Remedies, medicinal and dietetic, that are capable\r\nof correcting dyspeptic symptoms, such as slight bitters,[201] will\r\ndoubtless prove valuable resources; while all those agents which have a\r\ntendency to correct and regulate the insensible perspiration, will\r\nnecessarily fall under the head of anti-lithic remedies. Mr. Copland\r\nHutchison, in a paper which has been published in the Transactions of\r\nthe Medico-Chirurgical Society, has shewn a comparative rarity of\r\ncalculous disorders in British seamen. Can the quantity of muriate of\r\nsoda taken with their food, from its stimulating influence upon the\r\ncutaneous functions, be considered as affording a plausible explanation\r\nof this fact? The _Phosphatic Diathesis_ seems to be accompanied with\r\nconsiderable derangement of the chylo-poietic viscera, and Dr. Prout\r\nvery justly remarks, what I have frequently observed, that the stools\r\nare extremely unnatural; as the phosphates are retained in solution by\r\nan excess of acid, it would appear as if an alkaline principle was\r\noccasionally developed, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that this\r\nmay be sometimes derived from bilious regurgitations;[202] in some\r\ncases, the alkali is derived from the spontaneous decomposition of urine\r\nitself, especially where the bladder has lost its _governing\r\npower_,[203] as from some injury[204] of the spine; or from some local\r\naffection of the bladder or prostate gland; wherever the urine undergoes\r\nan incipient process of decomposition, ammonia will be generated, and an\r\n_ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate_[205] be immediately precipitated: hence\r\nin cases where the bladder is unable to discharge its contents, this\r\ndeposite is very apt to take place, as in diseases in the prostate; and\r\nthis explains the reason why the triple phosphates are so frequently\r\nformed in elderly people, who cannot wholly evacuate their bladder.\r\n\r\nIt will appear evident from these cursory observations, that some\r\nvarieties of Calculi will be influenced by acids, and others by\r\nalkalies, and that the exhibition of such remedies will be liable to\r\npalliate, or to aggravate the symptoms, according to the character and\r\ncomposition of the offending calculus, and according to the prevailing\r\ndiathesis of the patient; as a general rule to direct us in the\r\nchemico-medical treatment of these cases, Dr. Marcet states, that\r\n“_Whenever the lithic acid predominates, the alkalies[206] are the\r\nappropriate remedies, but that when the calcareous or magnesian salts\r\nprevail, the acids are to be resorted to_.” But if it be asked how we\r\nare to discover the nature of the calculous affection, so as to direct\r\nthe suitable remedy? the reply is obvious—by an examination of the\r\nsediment deposited by the recent urine, or by an analysis of the small\r\nfragments which are frequently voided with it; the Phosphates subside\r\nfrom the urine as a _white_, lithic acid, generally, as a _red_ deposit;\r\nand since the phosphates are held in solution in the urine by an excess\r\nof acid, it is evident that whenever such acidity is diminished by the\r\nhand of Nature or art, a white sabulous deposit will ensue; hence, says\r\nMr. Brande, it occurs in the urine of persons who drink soda water, or\r\ntake magnesia; the remedy of such a deposit, when it takes place\r\nhabitually, is a course of acidulous medicines; on the contrary, since\r\n_lithic acid_ is precipitated by the acids, alkalies are naturally\r\nsuggested for the prevention of that deposit. In the _compound_ calculi,\r\nacids and alkalies may be equally injurious or beneficial, for since\r\nthese bodies are composed of a variety of ingredients, the action of any\r\none solvent must be partial, and may convert the smooth calculus into a\r\nrough and highly irritating body, or vice versa. In the _alternating_\r\ncalculi it may be judicious to exhibit these remedies alternately, as\r\nthe symptoms of the case and the deposit of the urine may indicate.\r\nAfter all, however, the solvent powers of Lithonthryptic remedies must\r\nbe very limited, and in advanced cases we can never expect to procure\r\nmore than palliation. With respect to the agency of these different\r\nremedies, as _Antilithics_, I would observe, that while experience bears\r\nus out in confiding in the production of certain chemical effects from\r\ntheir use, we must not forget that much is to be effected by their\r\njudicious administration as _vital_ agents: and it will be hereafter my\r\nduty to point out the many advantages that may be obtained, by combining\r\nin one formula, medicines which individually belong to each class.\r\n\r\nIndependent of any chemical effect, alkaline substances are found by\r\ndaily experience to allay the morbid irritability of the urinary organs\r\nin a manner not yet explained; alkalies may also prove _generally_\r\nserviceable in these disorders, by acting immediately upon the digestive\r\norgans, for the disposition of forming calculi is always, more or less,\r\naccompanied with the indications of deranged digestion; and it is\r\nprobable that the first link of the series of actions, which cause this\r\ndisposition, has its origin in the stomach.\r\n\r\nThe alkaline carbonates are found to answer as effectually as the pure\r\nalkalies, and they have the advantage of being less liable to disagree\r\nwith the stomach. Mr. Hatchett has proposed the carbonate of magnesia,\r\nin doses of ℈j to ʒj, as a valuable substitute for alkaline remedies in\r\ncases of lithic calculi; but as its insolubility must render its\r\nabsorption equivocal, the beneficial operation of the substance must\r\nprincipally depend upon its neutralizing any excess of acid in the primæ\r\nviæ, and in this way there can be no doubt of its lithonthryptic agency;\r\n“but,” says Dr. Marcet, “such is the tendency which the public has to\r\nover-rate the utility of a new practice, or to take a mistaken view of\r\nits proper application, that there is every reason to believe that the\r\nuse of magnesia has of late years become a frequent source of evil in\r\ncalculous complaints.” Lime-water has been also recommended for the\r\npurpose of fulfilling the same indications, and as not being liable to\r\nproduce that irritability of stomach which frequently attends the long\r\ncontinued use of the fixed alkalies; besides which, some chemists have\r\nmaintained that it exerts a peculiar solvent power over the cementing\r\nanimal matter of the concretion, and thereby destroys its cohesion.[207]\r\n\r\nWhere an acid is indicated, the _Muriatic_ will in my judgment be found\r\nas convenient and effectual as any that can be administered. Mr. Brande\r\nproposes _Cream of Tartar_ for this purpose; upon this point I differ\r\nwith him, for this salt, to say the least of it, is questionable in its\r\nmode of operation; for although its first impression upon the stomach is\r\nthat of an acid, the subsequent processes of digestion decompose it, and\r\neliminate its base, which being absorbed acts upon the urinary organs as\r\nan alkali. I have seen a white sabulous deposit, consisting of the\r\nPhosphates, in the urine of persons after the constant use of _Imperial_\r\nas a beverage, which I am at a loss to explain upon any other principle.\r\nSir Gilbert Blane has also very satisfactorily shewn, that a fixed\r\nalkali produces the same effect upon the urinary organs whether it be\r\nexhibited alone, or in combination with citric acid; in this latter case\r\nthe salt undoubtedly undergoes a decomposition _in transitu_, as I have\r\nmore fully explained under the consideration of Diuretics, (_page 94_.)\r\nDuring an alterative course of Lithonthryptic remedies it may be\r\nbeneficial to interpose occasionally a purgative medicine, but we must\r\nnot combine it with the lithonthryptic, at least, if we wish this latter\r\nmedicine to reach the urinary passages; for it is a law which I have\r\nalready attempted to establish (_see page 94_), that _Catharsis suspends\r\nthe process of alimentary absorption_.\r\n\r\nThere remains to be considered another mode of applying a solvent, and\r\nwhich would seem on the first view of the subject to be full of\r\npromise,—that of injecting the proposed menstruum into the bladder.\r\nUnfortunately, however, the irritable state of this organ will generally\r\npreclude the possibility of preserving the menstruum, for a sufficient\r\nlength of time, in contact with the calculus to accomplish any material\r\nsolution; nor am I aware that any case, in favour of such a practice,\r\nstands recorded. An ingenious and novel application of the powers of\r\nElectro-chemistry has been lately[208] proposed by M M. Prevost and\r\nDumas, as capable of affording means for the solution of the calculus\r\nwithin the bladder; the suggestion is highly plausible, and ought not to\r\nbe hastily rejected without trial. Could the functions of the part be\r\nprotected against the influence of so powerful an agent, it is evident\r\nthat, by a galvanic battery of sufficient intensity, a calculus composed\r\nof alkaline or earthy salts might be transferred from the bladder by the\r\nsimple introduction of a double sound, communicating on one hand with\r\nthe calculus, and, on the other, with two vessels filled with water, in\r\nwhich are plunged the opposite poles of a galvanic apparatus.[209] This\r\narrangement would transfer the acid constituents into the vessel\r\nconnected with the _positive_ end, and the bases into that of the\r\n_negative_ end. So far, however, as the experiments have hitherto been\r\ncarried, this degree of galvanic operation would seem to excite too much\r\nirritation in the bladder to be admissible; but it still offers a\r\nresource of an apparently more practicable nature. This consists in\r\ngiving to the calculus a tendency to crumble from the slightest force;\r\nsuch a friability, in short, as shall render it easily broken into\r\npieces sufficiently small to be evacuated through the urethra,\r\nespecially by the aid of dilating that passage, an operation upon which\r\nmuch has lately been said and written. A fusible calculus from the human\r\nsubject was submitted to the action of a pile, consisting of 120 pairs\r\nof plates, for twelve hours in succession. The platinum wires,\r\nconstituting the poles, were placed in contact with the calculus, about\r\nsix or eight lines distant from each other, and the whole plunged in a\r\nvessel filled with pure water. During the galvanic action, the bases and\r\nphosphoric acid first arrived at their respective poles, then re-entered\r\ninto combination, when the salt thus reformed was precipitated in the\r\nstate of powder. The calculus weighed 92 grains before the experiment,\r\nand was reduced at its termination to 80. The process being continued,\r\nat the end of sixteen hours it presented a mass of such friable texture\r\nas to be reduced into small crystalline particles by the slightest\r\npressure; the largest of which did not exceed the size of a lentil, so\r\nthat it might have easily passed through the urethra.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain how far this decomposition could be effected in\r\nthe living body, the ingenious experimentalists selected a dog of rather\r\nlarge size, into whose bladder they introduced a fusible calculus\r\nattached to a sound, and between two conductors of platinum; the bladder\r\nwas next distended by injecting tepid water, and the apparatus subjected\r\nto galvanic influence. After a little struggling, the animal became\r\ncalm, and was subjected to the operation during an hour. On removing the\r\nsound, the calculus shewed unequivocal marks of decomposition. The same\r\nprocess was repeated, night and morning, during six days, when the\r\nfriability of the calculus rendered it impossible to continue the\r\nexperiment. It had lost weight in the same proportion as in the\r\npreceding trial. The bladder, which was afterwards examined, exhibited\r\nno appearance of injury or disease.[210] The authors assert that this\r\norgan does not suffer any inconvenience from this more moderate degree\r\nof galvanic action, and suggest, as a proof of the mildness of its\r\ninfluence, that we should immerse the tongue in a vessel filled with\r\nwater, in which a calculus is undergoing decomposition, and it will be\r\nfound that the tongue, which is far more sensible than the bladder, will\r\nscarcely perceive the galvanic action, even when decomposition is going\r\non briskly. The authors add, that this process cannot offer any\r\nadvantage for the removal of those calculi which consist wholly of _Uric\r\nacid_, or which contain a large proportion of it.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ANTIDOTES.\r\n\r\n       Synon: _Alexipharmics._ _Alexiterials._ _Counter-poisons._\r\n\r\nMedicines which are capable of preventing the ill effects of a poison;\r\nor, of counteracting its fatal virulence.\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no subject upon which the credulity of mankind has been\r\nso extravagantly exercised as on that of POISONS; nor is there,\r\ncertainly, any class of remedies whose history has suffered so many\r\nvicissitudes from the caprice of hypothesis, as that of ANTIDOTES.[212]\r\n\r\nIt is not my intention, on the present occasion,[213] to enumerate the\r\nmany extraordinary virtues[214] which credulity has, at different times,\r\nassigned to such medicines; nor shall I consume the time of the reader\r\nby attempting to expose the absurdity of those fearful powers with which\r\nignorance, terror, and imposture, have invested certain poisons,—a\r\nsubtlety so extreme as to defeat the most skilful caution, and a\r\nvirulence so manageable as to be capable of the most accurate\r\ngraduation; so that while the former attribute was believed to ensure\r\ntheir deadly operation, although exerted through the most secret and\r\nleast suspicious medium, as that of gloves,[215] tapers, or letters, the\r\nlatter was said to enable the accomplished assassin to measure the\r\nallotted moments of his victim with the nicest precision, and to\r\noccasion his death at any period that might best answer the objects of\r\nthe assassination.[216]\r\n\r\nThe abandonment of such notions may be considered as one among the many\r\nadvantages which have arisen to medicine, from the cultivation of\r\nphysiology.\r\n\r\nWithout farther introduction, I shall proceed to the main object of this\r\nwork, and inquire how far a _chemical agent_ may be capable of\r\nneutralizing, or of decomposing, a poisonous substance in the human\r\nbody; and endeavour to ascertain the degree of confidence to which it\r\nmay in each particular case be entitled; equally important is it to\r\nlearn, whether certain _vital_ agents may not be serviceable in cases of\r\npoisoning, either by promoting the elimination of the poison, or by\r\nproducing a state of the system best calculated to resist its\r\ndeleterious operation.\r\n\r\nIt may be safely asserted that we possess very few true antidotes; for\r\nalthough several of the mineral poisons may be neutralized or decomposed\r\nby various reagents, yet their destructive action is generally so rapid,\r\nthat the mischief is effected before any chemical changes can avail;\r\nand, in other cases, the substances resulting from the chemical action,\r\nare as poisonous as the original ingredients, as in the case of the\r\ndecomposition of _Corrosive Sublimate_, by the alkalies and earths, when\r\nthe precipitated oxide is as virulent as the original salt; while, under\r\ncertain circumstances, I suspect that the vital powers of the stomach\r\nare in direct opposition to those changes and decompositions which so\r\nreadily, and so uniformly, take place in our laboratories. To _vital\r\nagents_ then, the practitioner must principally look for succour; but\r\nbefore we can establish any general rules for the treatment of\r\npoisoning, it is essential to distinguish between the different modes in\r\nwhich poisonous substances produce their effects, or at least to\r\ndetermine the parts of the living system through which they act; for it\r\nwill be found, that each poison has its own _modus operandi_, from which\r\nalone can be derived the particular indications of cure.\r\n\r\nThe hypotheses devised by the ancient physicians, to account for the\r\ndestructive powers of these substances, were principally derived from\r\nmechanical notions respecting the supposed form of their particles,\r\nwhich they imagined capable of lacerating and disuniting the animal\r\nfibres by the sharpness of their spiculæ;[217] it is however, now\r\nsatisfactorily established that the action of a poison in the human\r\nstomach is very rarely, if ever, _mechanical_; sometimes _chemical_; but\r\nfor the most part _vital_ in its operation.\r\n\r\nEach of the three kingdoms of Nature furnishes a number of poisons, the\r\ninvestigation of whose chemical properties and physiological actions,\r\nand that of the symptoms to which their administration gives rise, the\r\nlesions of structure which they occasion, and of the medical treatment\r\nwhich they require, constitutes an elaborate branch of science\r\ndesignated by the term TOXICOLOGY, and of which I have more fully\r\ntreated in my work on Medical Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nPoisons differ materially from each other, not only with respect to the\r\nmodes in which they produce their effects in relation to the several\r\nvital organs, but with respect to their application; some of those, for\r\ninstance, which, if introduced into a wound, are speedily fatal, may be\r\ntaken into the stomach with complete impunity, as in the instance of the\r\nvenom of the viper and other snakes, which appears to exert no influence\r\non the stomach; others, on the contrary, display their deleterious\r\naction on the stomach alone, such as caustic acids, and alkalies,\r\ncorrosive sublimate, and some chemical poisons; while others, again, are\r\nequally destructive whether applied to the inner surface of the stomach,\r\nor to the lower intestines, in the form of clyster, or even to the\r\nmucous membrane of the mouth or nose; to the eye; to the vagina and\r\norifice of the uterus, or to an abraded portion of the skin. There is,\r\nmoreover, a class of substances which may be termed _Aerial_ poisons,\r\nfor they may exist in the state of gas, or be held dissolved in the\r\natmosphere, and be received by respiration, or by the mucous membranes\r\nof the nose and throat; the saliva may also thus become the medium for\r\ntransferring various subtile poisons from the atmosphere to the animal\r\nbody; this is well illustrated by the fact of the transfer of metallic\r\ninfluence, as related in the case of a gentleman in perfect health who\r\nbecame salivated in consequence of sitting for one hour by the side of a\r\nperson who was in a state of mercurial ptyalism, in order to give him a\r\nlesson in botany.\r\n\r\nIt also deserves notice, that a poison acts with different degrees of\r\nforce and celerity in different parts of the same tissue; its\r\nabsorption, for instance, would appear to be energetic in proportion to\r\nthe number of veins,[218] although several apparent exceptions to this\r\nlaw might be adduced, and it is evident that the plethoric state of the\r\npart with respect to its blood-vessels has a considerable share in\r\nmodifying the effects; this observation, however, has no relation to\r\nthose poisons which operate on the system through the sympathetic\r\ncommunication of the nerves; Mr. Brodie, for instance, found that the\r\npoison of bitter almonds acted more speedily when applied to the tongue\r\nthan when injected into the intestine, though the latter presents a much\r\nbetter absorbing surface.\r\n\r\n_Foderé_, in the fourth volume of his _Medicine Legale_, arranges\r\npoisons according to their action on the living system, and which, with\r\na slight alteration in the order of the classes, has been adopted by\r\n_Orfila_, and most other writers on Toxicology. Poisons are thus reduced\r\ninto six classes: viz. 1. CORROSIVE or ESCHAROTIC, as the _Preparations\r\nof Mercury_, _Arsenic_, _Antimony_, _Copper_, _Tin_, _Zinc_, _Silver_,\r\n_Gold_, and _Bismuth_; the _concentrated Acids_, and _caustic Alkalies_,\r\nand _Earths_; _Cantharides_; _glass and enamel powder_; _diamond\r\ndust_.[219] 2. ASTRINGENT POISONS, of which the _preparations of Lead_\r\nconstitute the only species. 3. ACRID or RUBEFACIENT POISONS, which,\r\nwith a few exceptions, are furnished by the vegetable kingdom, as\r\ncertain _drastic purgatives_, _Hellebore_, _Euphorbium_, &c. 4. NARCOTIC\r\nPOISONS, _Opium_, _Henbane_, the _Cherry-laurel_, _Stramonium_, &c. 5.\r\nNARCOTICO-ACRID, embracing such articles as produce the united effects\r\nof the two former, and which constitute some of the most deadly poisons,\r\nas the _Ticunas_, _Nux-vomica_, _Belladonna_, _Tobacco_, _Hemlock_,\r\n_Digitalis_, &c. 6. SEPTIC POISONS, _contagious miasmata_, _putrid\r\nexhalations from animal matter_, _Sulphuretted Hydrogen_, the _venom of\r\nthe viper_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe value of this classification has been very justly stated to consist\r\nin its combining to a certain degree, the advantages of a pathological\r\narrangement with those of one founded on the basis of Natural History;\r\nfor, while it is strictly pathological, it at the same time distributes\r\nthe different poisons, with some few and unimportant exceptions, in an\r\norder corresponding with that of their natural history. The First two\r\nclasses, for instance, present us with substances of a mineral origin;\r\nthe Third and Fourth, with those which are chiefly of a vegetable\r\nnature; and the Sixth, with objects principally belonging to the animal\r\nkingdom. The importance of acknowledging a division, which has a\r\nreference to the organic and inorganic kingdoms of Nature, is\r\nconsiderable in a chemical point of view; for in enumerating the various\r\nexperiments to be instituted for the detection of poisons, we are thus\r\nenabled to bring together a connected series of processes, nearly allied\r\nto, intimately connected with, and in some respects mutually dependent\r\nupon, each other. At the same time it must be acknowledged, that this\r\nclassification has many defects and some fallacies. In the first place,\r\nit has little or no reference to the enlarged views of the modern\r\nphysiologist, respecting the “_modus operandi_” of Poisons; nor indeed\r\nis its construction susceptible of such modifications and improvements,\r\nas can ever render its degree of perfection progressive with the\r\nadvancement of science. In the next place, the classes are in many\r\nparticulars ill defined, and indistinctly, if not erroneously, divided.\r\nHow questionable, for instance, are the boundaries which separate\r\n_Corrosive_ from _Acrid_ poisons? the respective species, even, of each\r\nclass are, in many cases, less allied to each other, than are the great\r\ndivisions to which they are subordinate. As an exemplification of this\r\nfact we have only to compare the physiological actions of _Arsenic_ and\r\n_Corrosive Sublimate_, both of which are arranged under the class of\r\nCorrosive Poisons. The former of these substances undoubtedly occasions\r\ndeath by being absorbed, and thus acting as a vital agent; the latter,\r\nby its local action, as a caustic on the textures with which it\r\nimmediately comes into contact. In the same manner, if we examine the\r\nindividual actions of the different species composing the class of\r\n“_Acrid_ Poisons,” we shall discover the same want of uniformity; thus,\r\nthe _Spurge Flax_, and the _Iatropa Curcas_, act by occasioning a local\r\ninflammation, while the _Hellebore_, being rapidly absorbed, exerts a\r\nfatal action on the nervous system, and produces only a very slight\r\ninflammation. The class of Narcotic Poisons is certainly more absolute\r\nin its definition, and more uniform in its physiological affinities, and\r\ntherefore less objectionable than the divisions to which we have just\r\nalluded; but the propriety of the class “_Narcotico-Acrid_” is by no\r\nmeans equally unexceptionable; indeed Orfila himself questions it,\r\n“because the narcotic or sedative effects only follow the previous\r\nexcitement.” Some of the poisons of this division also are rapidly\r\nabsorbed, and act, through the medium of the circulation, on the nervous\r\nsystem, without producing any local inflammation; while others, on the\r\ncontrary, merely act upon the extremities of the nerves, with which they\r\ncome in contact, and, without being absorbed, occasion death by a\r\nspecies of sympathetic action.\r\n\r\nThese few objections, and many more might be urged, are sufficient to\r\ndemonstrate the imperfection of the classification under consideration,\r\nand which must render it wholly unavailable to the physician in the\r\ntreatment of cases of poisoning, who must derive his plan of cure from\r\nthe physiological action of the substance against which he has to\r\ncontend; thus, for instance, _Arsenic_ and _Corrosive Sublimate_ are\r\nboth corrosive poisons, but so materially do they differ from each other\r\nin their physiological actions that, when swallowed, they will require\r\nfor the preservation of the individual, a very different system of\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nFor such reasons I have ventured to propose a new arrangement of\r\nPoisons, which may furnish the practitioner with a general theorem for\r\nthe administration of Antidotes.\r\n\r\n                     A SYNOPTICAL TABLE OF POISONS,\r\n\r\n                             NEWLY ARRANGED\r\n\r\n  ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT PRIMARY OPERATIONS, BY WHICH THEY PRODUCE\r\n                             THEIR EFFECTS,\r\n\r\n   With a view to furnish a General Theorem for the administration of\r\n                               Antidotes.\r\n\r\n ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n CLASS I.

It had been\r\nlong admitted that a poison might occasion death, by acting on the\r\nnerves of the stomach and intestines without being absorbed; but to the\r\nexperimental labours of Mr. Brodie[222] we are principally indebted for\r\nour present correct views of the subject. The class admits of two\r\nimportant divisions, into one comprehending those poisons which destroy\r\nthe functions of the brain, and into another, including those which\r\ndirect their influence upon the heart. We shall offer a few observations\r\nupon the facts which have suggested such a division, and upon the\r\npractical advantages which may attend its adoption.\r\n\r\nIt was observed by _Bichât_, and the observation has been fully\r\nconfirmed by _Brodie_, that the influence of the brain is not _directly_\r\nnecessary to the action of the heart; and is _immediately_ necessary to\r\nlife, only because the muscles of respiration owe their action to its\r\ninfluence.[223] For when the functions of the brain are destroyed, even\r\nwhen the head is removed, the heart continues to contract for some time\r\nafterwards, and then ceases only in consequence of the suspension of\r\nrespiration, which is under the direct influence of the brain. Assuming\r\nthis as a fact, it will appear evident that certain poisons may, by\r\naffecting the brain, so paralyse the muscles of respiration as to\r\noccasion death by suffocation, and by such a mode of operation I imagine\r\nthat those substances, arranged in the former division of my first\r\nclass, prove mortal. _Mr. Brodie_ accordingly found that, by the\r\nadministration of a large dose of alcohol to a rabbit, the pupils of its\r\neyes became dilated, the extremities convulsed, and the respiration\r\nlaborious, and that this latter function was gradually performed at\r\nlonger and longer intervals, and that it at length entirely ceased. Two\r\nminutes after the apparent death of the animal, he opened the thorax,\r\nand found the heart acting with moderate force and frequency,\r\n_circulating dark coloured blood_; he then introduced a tube into the\r\ntrachea, and produced artificial respiration by inflating the lungs, and\r\nhe found that by these means the action of the heart might be kept up to\r\nthe natural standard, as in an animal from whom the head is removed. The\r\nsame phenomena resulted from the injection of two drops of the\r\n_Essential Oil of Bitter Almonds_, diffused in half an ounce of water,\r\ninto the rectum of a cat; and from the application of the empyreumatic\r\noil of _Tobacco_ to the tongue, and rectum of cats and dogs. Now it is\r\nobvious that the functions of the brain are immediately disordered by\r\nthe influence of these poisons on the tongue, stomach, and lower bowels\r\nof animals, so instantaneously, that it is impossible absorption should\r\nhave already taken place.\r\n\r\nAlthough the general proposition seems to be established, that the brain\r\nis not _immediately_ necessary to the action of the heart, yet it must\r\nnot lead us to the conclusion that the heart is therefore incapable of\r\nbeing affected by violent impressions on the nervous system; the fact is\r\nquite otherwise, for although the brain may be removed, and the\r\ncirculation be nevertheless maintained by artificial respiration, yet an\r\ninjury of another kind inflicted on the brain, may be followed by those\r\nimmediately fatal consequences which decapitation itself would not\r\nproduce; thus is a blow on the head commonly followed by syncope, and\r\nthere are certain poisons that would seem to act in the same manner,\r\nsuch is the _Infusion of Tobacco_,[224] which suspends the action of the\r\nheart long before the animal ceases to respire, and kills by producing\r\nsyncope, although in this latter case it has been questioned whether the\r\nspinal marrow may not be primarily affected, which has been shewn by\r\nrecent experiments to have an intimate relation with the action of the\r\nheart. Be this as it may, it is sufficiently obvious, that the second\r\ndivision of the first class is sanctioned by theory, and confirmed by\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nWe come now to speak of the Second Class,—of those Poisons which enter\r\nthe circulation, and act through that medium on the heart, brain, and\r\nalimentary canal. These organs, however, are affected in very different\r\ndegrees by different poisons, or even by the same poisons, under\r\ndifferent circumstances. _Mr. Brodie_ has shewn that vegetable poison,\r\nalthough when introduced into the alimentary canal affect life, in\r\nconsequence of the nervous sympathy which subsists between these\r\nsurfaces and the common sensorium, yet, that the same poisons applied\r\nexternally to a wound, produce their effects exclusively through the\r\nmedium of the circulation, being conveyed to the brain only by mixing\r\nwith the blood in its vessels, and not by being conveyed through the\r\nlymphatics, for a ligature upon the great blood-vessels prevents their\r\nproducing deleterious effects; whereas a ligature upon the thoracic\r\nduct, or general canal through which all the absorbents pour their\r\ncontents into the blood, does _not_ in the least retard or prevent the\r\noperation of the poison. There are also several of the mineral poisons\r\nwhich, whether introduced into the stomach, or applied externally to a\r\nwound, poison the animal in consequence of being carried into the\r\ncirculation. It had long been supposed that Arsenic occasioned death by\r\ninflaming the stomach; but _Mr. Brodie_ has very satisfactorily shewn\r\nthat its influence arises from its absorption, and that it must be\r\nregarded rather as a _vital_, than as a _chemical_ agent. In the first\r\nplace, he has found the inflammation of the stomach, in several cases,\r\nso slight, that on a superficial examination it might have been easily\r\noverlooked; and, in most of his experiments with Arsenic, death took\r\nplace in too short a time to be considered as the result of\r\ninflammation; and in the next place, in whatever manner the poison is\r\napplied, whether _externally_ to a wound, or _internally_ to the\r\nmembrane of the stomach, the inflammation is confined to the stomach and\r\nintestines; and, indeed, it is commonly more violent, and even more\r\nimmediate, when applied to a wound, than when internally administered;\r\nand it also precedes any inflammation of the wound. This important fact\r\nwas proved by an experiment made by Mr. Hunter and Sir Everard Home, and\r\nsubsequently by the repeated investigations of Mr. Brodie.\r\n\r\nIt has been just stated that after a poison has found its way into the\r\ncirculation, it expends its virulence upon some particular organs. In\r\nsome cases this is much more striking than in others. The preparations\r\nof _Baryta_, and of _Tartarized Antimony_, attack the heart, and\r\noccasion death by syncope. _Arsenic_ is less definite in its action, it\r\ninfluences both the brain and the heart, but with different degrees of\r\nforce in different cases, so that it is often difficult to ascertain\r\nwhich of these organs is the first to fail in its functions.\r\n_Hydro-cyanic Acid_ is absorbed, and destroys life by its action upon\r\nthe nervous system, whose energies it would seem to extinguish without\r\nany ostensible injury to the respiration and circulation; for in all\r\nthose animals which were killed by it in the experiments of _Orfila_,\r\n_Brodie_, and others, the heart was found acting regularly, and\r\ncirculating dark-coloured blood; and in some cases, this phenomenon was\r\nvisible for many minutes after the animal was in other respects\r\napparently dead.\r\n\r\nSome substances would seem to direct their powers to various parts of\r\nthe alimentary canal; and the appearance so produced might be mistaken\r\nfor the effects of the local action of the poison, had they not been\r\nclearly proved by experiment to have arisen from an application\r\naddressed through the medium of the circulation; thus is inflammation of\r\nthe _primæ viæ_ induced by the contact of Arsenic with an external\r\nsurface of the body!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Third Class_ of my arrangement includes those poisons which enter\r\nthe circulation, and, through that medium, expend their influence upon\r\nthe spinal marrow, without _directly_ involving the functions of the\r\nbrain. _M. Majendie_, in the year 1809, submitted to the first class of\r\nthe French Institute a series of experiments which had conducted him to\r\nthe extraordinary result above stated. He found that an entire class of\r\nvegetables (the _bitter Strychnus_) possesses this singular property.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Fourth Class_ comprehends all those substances which destroy life\r\nby a local action upon the alimentary canal, not by any impression upon\r\ntheir nerves, but by simply inducing a fatal lesion in the membranes.\r\n\r\nThrough one or more of the above modes of operation all poisons may be\r\nsaid to produce their fatal effects. In some cases a poisonous substance\r\nwill be found to act in several different ways; thus, the _Nightshade_\r\nis evidently absorbed, carried into the circulation, and is enabled,\r\nthrough that medium to act upon the brain; at the same time it exerts a\r\nlocal action upon the stomach, although less violent than that\r\noccasioned by the acrid poisons; it moreover would appear, upon some\r\noccasions, to act directly through the medium of the nerves, like those\r\nsubstances which have been received in our first class, or else, how\r\nshall we explain the fact of the pupil of the eye becoming permanently\r\ndilated by the contact of the _Belladonna_ with the tunica conjunctiva?\r\nIt would appear therefore that this plant unites within itself all the\r\nthree great modes of action, upon which I have just attempted to\r\nestablish a physiological arrangement of Poisons. So again, _Corrosive\r\nSublimate_, although placed in the fourth division, as being a substance\r\nwhich destroys by inflicting local mischief, is nevertheless capable of\r\nbeing absorbed. The embarrassments, however, which might be supposed to\r\narise from this double mode of operation, are of but trifling\r\nimportance. It is to the primary operation of a poison to which we are\r\nto direct our attention, the subsequent effects are less important in as\r\nmuch as they are more capable of being controlled.\r\n\r\nHaving thus offered a summary of our present views respecting the\r\nphysiological action of Poisons, we are prepared to lay down a general\r\nplan of treatment, which, it will be seen, can only be successful when\r\nconducted on principles strictly conformable with the just notions which\r\nthe preceding experiments have so satisfactorily established.\r\n\r\nWhere a poisonous substance has, either through accident or design,\r\nfound its way into the alimentary canal, three important indications\r\nare, if possible, to be fulfilled; and under these heads I shall offer\r\nsuch observations as may serve to instruct the practitioner in the\r\nphilosophy of the general treatment, reserving the details to be\r\nobserved in that of each poison, for more particular notice in a\r\nsubsequent part of the work, where the history of these substances will\r\nbe individually considered. The indications to which I allude are the\r\nfollowing, viz.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The immediate ejectment of the poison from the body, by the\r\noperation of vomiting and purging._\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the nature of the poison, we should endeavour with all\r\npossible expedition, to eject it from the body; and upon the promptness\r\nwith which this is effected, the safety of the patient will generally\r\ndepend; for the dangerous effects of such substances advance in a very\r\nincreasing ratio, with the time they remain in contact with a living\r\nsurface. A question may arise, whether in some cases it would not be\r\njudicious to attempt in the first instance the neutralization or\r\ndecomposition of the poison; where a mineral acid, or a caustic alkali\r\nhas been swallowed, it would undoubtedly be right to neutralize, and\r\ndilute it, as soon as possible, and then to excite vomiting, which may\r\nbe advantageously effected by thrusting the finger down the throat, or\r\nby tickling the internal fauces with a feather: where an emetic is at\r\nhand, whatever may be its nature, it should be promptly given, but if\r\ncircumstances will allow us the opportunity of selection, _Antimony_,\r\n_Ipecacuanha_, &c. should be rejected, and _Sulphate of Zinc_, or\r\n_Sulphate of Copper_, for several reasons, be preferred; in the first\r\nplace they do not require much dilution[225] for their action, a\r\ncircumstance of no small importance in the treatment of poisons that act\r\nby being absorbed; in the next place, they are extremely expeditious, a\r\ndose of fifteen or twenty grains producing almost instantaneous\r\nvomiting, without exciting that previous stage of nausea which so\r\nfrequently characterises other emetics, and which occasions a state of\r\nthe vascular system highly favourable to the function of absorption, (as\r\nI have so fully explained at page 86, &c.)\r\n\r\nThe practice of emptying the stomach by means of a syringe, as proposed\r\nby Boerhaave, has lately been revived with all the confidence of a _new_\r\ninvention. There are cases of narcotic poisoning in which there can be\r\nno doubt it would furnish the practitioner with a valuable resource, but\r\nI much fear that it will be found to be less successful than its more\r\nsanguine advocates have anticipated; for where the stomach has so far\r\nlost its power as to be insensible to the stimulus of a potent emetic,\r\nthe chances of recovery are small; the practice, however, in such cases\r\nought never to be neglected, for it cannot possibly do harm, and may\r\nperhaps be beneficial.\r\n\r\nAfter all has been ejected, which the operations of art can effect, we\r\nare to proceed, without delay, to the fulfilment of the second\r\nindication; viz.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Decomposition of any remaining Portion, and the adoption of\r\nmeasures best calculated to obviate its absorption._\r\n\r\nWhere the substance is in a solid form, and acts by absorption, we\r\nshould be very cautious how we favour its solution; while, if it exists\r\nin a liquid state, our object must be to render its active portion\r\ninsoluble; this problem involves a series of questions which are wholly\r\n_chemical_. In order to prevent, or retard, the absorption of the active\r\nmatter, we must, to a great degree, depend upon the agency of _vital_\r\nadjuvants; this latter indication however does not apply to _Corrosive\r\nSublimate_ and other substances which act upon the stomach locally, and\r\nare not absorbed; copious dilution also, in such cases, will frequently\r\ndisarm the poison of its virulence,[226] but it should be followed as\r\nquickly as possible by vomiting. In cases where the poison requires to\r\nbe absorbed, before it can display its energies, it would be generally\r\nunsafe to administer any solvent. Nothing therefore can be less true as\r\nan aphorism, nor more dangerous as a precept, than the unqualified\r\nassertion of Boerhaave, “_Aqua omnia venena enervat, quæ cum aqua\r\nmisceri possunt_.” (Prælect. in Instit: T. vi. p. 289.) _Alkaline_\r\nsolutions and _Magnesia_, in cases of the ingestion of arsenic,\r\naccelerate its fatal effects, by promoting its solution,[227] whereas\r\n_Lime_, or its _Carbonate_, has as an opposite tendency,[228] in\r\nconsequence of the insolubility of _Arsenite of Lime_; so again, Orfila\r\nhas shewn that the pernicious qualities of the _Muriate of Baryta_ are\r\ncounteracted by the administration of any soluble _Sulphate_, which\r\nrenders the former substance _insoluble_. In cases where _Verdegris_ has\r\nbeen swallowed, the administration of vinegar greatly increases its\r\nvirulence, as M. Drouard has ascertained, by converting the substance\r\ninto a soluble _acetate of copper_. This view of the subject will\r\nexplain why the pure earth _Baryta_ is so slow, and comparatively inert,\r\nin its effects upon the system, while its _muriate_ is distinguished by\r\nthe extreme rapidity and virulence with which it operates. The propriety\r\nof administering _vinegar_, _lemonade_, and different acid potations, in\r\norder to counteract the baneful effects of _Opium_, which has been so\r\noften questioned, will thus also receive ample explanation; it must\r\nappear that, if any quantity of the substance of opium remain in the\r\nprimæ viæ, acid, or mucilaginous drinks will, by favouring its solution\r\nand absorption, accelerate its fatal effects;[229] but should it have\r\nbeen previously ejected from the stomach, that then the anti-narcotic\r\ninfluence of a vegetable acid[230] may remove the consecutive stupor and\r\ndelirium, and thus realize the expectations which Virgil has so\r\npoetically raised.\r\n\r\n          “Media fert tristes succos tardumque saporem\r\n          Felicis Mali: quo non præsentius ullum\r\n          (Pocula si quando sævæ infecere novercæ\r\n          Miscueruntque herbas, et non innoxia verba)\r\n          Auxilium venit, ac membris agit atra venena.”\r\n\r\n          “Nor be the Citron, Media’s boast unsung,\r\n          Though harsh the juice, and ling’ring on the tongue.\r\n          When the drug’d bowl mid witching curses brew’d\r\n          Wastes the pale youth by step-dame hate pursu’d,\r\n          Its powerful aid unbinds the mutter’d spell\r\n          And frees the victim from the draught of hell.”\r\n\r\nChardin, in his travels through Persia, informs us that when a Persian\r\nfinds himself in a distressed situation, he has recourse to a piece of\r\nopium as large as the thumb, and that immediately afterwards he drinks a\r\nglassful of vinegar; by which he is thrown into a fit of laughter,\r\nterminating in convulsions and death.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the use of _Antidotes_, it has been already stated how\r\nlittle they are to be depended upon; in certain cases, however, we are\r\nbound to acknowledge their power, but they should be very rarely\r\ntrusted, unless subsequent to, or in conjunction with, the operation of\r\nan emetic; in many cases the effects of this latter remedy may be\r\npromoted by the ingestion of liquids holding the particular antidote in\r\nsolution, a practice which offers the double advantage of accelerating\r\nthe elimination of the poison, and at the same time of decomposing any\r\nwhich may remain. Orfila has fully established the fact of _Albumen_\r\nbeing a counter-poison to _Corrosive Sublimate_; vomiting may therefore\r\nbe very judiciously promoted in cases of such poisoning by water holding\r\nthe white of egg in solution; with equal effect, where _Verdegris_ has\r\nbeen swallowed, sugared water may be used as a diluent to encourage\r\nemesis; and _Muriate of Soda_ in solution will be found the most\r\nefficient antidote to _Nitrate of Silver_; and _Sulphate of Magnesia_ to\r\n_Acetate of Lead_. Where an emetic salt, like _Tartarized Antimony_, has\r\nbeen taken, copious dilution with common water will in general so\r\nprovoke vomiting, as to render it its own antidote; but it may be useful\r\nto remember, that the _Infusion of Galls_, and according to Berthollet,\r\nthe _Decoctions of Bark_, at the temperature of from 30° to 40° _Fah._\r\nhave the power of decomposing it; while Orfila considers milk the most\r\nefficient counter-poison to the _Sulphate of Zinc_.\r\n\r\nHaving ejected from the stomach all the poisonous matter we can by\r\nvomiting, and attempted to decompose what remains, we are to pursue such\r\nmeasures as may be calculated to prevent the absorption of the poison\r\ninto the circulation; it has been already observed that on this account\r\nnauseating emetics should be avoided; the reader is now requested to\r\nrefer to our _exposé_ of the celebrated doctrine of _Majendie_, (_page\r\n86_, _note_) and he will see that _Venesection_ proves one of the most\r\npowerful means of exciting the function of absorption; hence in\r\npoisoning by arsenic, such an expedient should never be\r\nrecommended,[231] while a particle of that substance remains in the\r\nbody; where _Corrosive Sublimate_ has been swallowed, the same\r\nprecaution is unnecessary. The last indication which remains to be\r\nfulfilled is—\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _To anticipate the occurrence of the Consecutive Phœnomena, and to\r\ncombat them by appropriate treatment._\r\n\r\nThis is to be conducted on the general principles of Therapeutics; the\r\ntreatment must necessarily vary in each particular case. Where the\r\nexhaustion of nervous energy is to be feared, as after poisoning by\r\n_Prussic Acid_, ammonia, and other diffusible stimulants, together with\r\nexternal warmth, will furnish the best resource; for the same reason\r\nVenesection should be performed with great caution and judgment after a\r\nnarcotic poison. Where, on the other hand, inflammatory action is to be\r\nanticipated, it is unnecessary to detail the plan of treatment which may\r\nbe adopted with the greatest chance of success. In cases where the\r\nnervous system is stupified, the symptoms may be combated by vegetable\r\nacids, infusion of coffee, &c. but where it is in a state of\r\npræternatural excitement, recourse must be had to opiates.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ESCHAROTICS:[232]\r\n\r\nSubstances whose application to the animal solids, erodes, or decomposes\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe operation of these bodies may, in general, be considered chemical;\r\nfor having destroyed the life of the part to which they are applied,\r\nthey cause, as if by a species of resulting affinity, the elements of\r\nthe animal matter to enter into a new state of combination; this is well\r\nexemplified in the action of caustic potass, where the nascent elements\r\nthus disengaged by the decomposition of the animal substance, reunite in\r\nproportions to generate an oily matter, which may be observed to form a\r\nfilm over the ulcerated surface, while the excess of nitrogen and\r\nhydrogen constitute ammonia, which is disengaged during the action of\r\nthe caustic; and may be rendered sensible by inverting over the surface,\r\na small jar moistened with muriatic acid, when the fumes of _Muriate of\r\nAmmonia_ become visible.[233]\r\n\r\nTheir surgical value consists in their power to remove excrescencies, to\r\nestablish an ulcer, or to convert an ulcerated surface into a simple\r\nsore.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      IV. OF MECHANICAL REMEDIES.\r\n\r\nThis subdivision includes those classes of remedies, whose operation\r\ndepends entirely upon _mechanical_ principles; and we must agree with\r\nDr. Murray in considering them as the least important of all the\r\narticles which we have enumerated, and which cannot therefore constitute\r\nobjects of elaborate inquiry.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             ANTHELMINTICS:\r\n\r\nRemedies which expel worms[234] from the intestinal canal.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, (_page 90_) that certain bodies have the\r\npower of increasing the peristaltic motions of the intestinal canal, by\r\noperating as mechanical stimulants upon its fibres; in this manner the\r\nfilings of tin and iron, or the irritating down which covers the pods of\r\nthe _Dolichos Pruriens_, are supposed to act in dislodging and\r\nevacuating the worms from the intestines. But there is a variety of\r\nremedies employed as vermifuges, which must owe their effects to a very\r\ndifferent mode of operation; _Bitters_ for instance appear to prove an\r\nabsolute poison[235] to these animals, while they, at the same time,\r\ngive an increased tone to the organs of digestion; from whose debility\r\nthe generation of worms would seem to arise. Other remedies, again,\r\nobviously depend upon their simple cathartic property, for the powers\r\nwhich they possess in the evacuation of worms. See _Terebinthinæ\r\nOleum_—_Cambogia_.\r\n\r\nIn the cure of Ascarides the local application of the remedy becomes\r\nnecessary, in the form of glyster, and which acts both _mechanically_ in\r\nwashing out the gut, and _medicinally_ in proving obnoxious to the\r\nanimals. According to the experience of some of our best practitioners,\r\na strong decoction of the _Semina Santonici_ proves most efficacious\r\nupon these occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              DEMULCENTS:\r\n\r\nMedicines which are capable of shielding sensible surfaces from the\r\naction of acrid matter, by involving it in a mild and viscid medium.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied that where these remedies admit of direct\r\napplication, considerable benefit may arise; in the progress of a\r\ncatarrh, we have all experienced the relief that may be occasioned by\r\nlubricating the fauces with demulcents, which, by soothing the top of\r\nthe trachea, quiets, by a kind of contiguous sympathy, the whole\r\npulmonary structure; in certain states of intestinal irritation, the\r\nsame remedies have furnished considerable benefit, and in ophthalmia,\r\nrelief has been obtained by the application of a demulcent to the\r\ninflamed conjunctiva, by which it is defended from the irritation of the\r\ntears; see also _Formula 61_; but in parts beyond the reach of the first\r\npassages, and to which no fluid can arrive but through the medium of the\r\nsecretions, it is very difficult to explain the principle upon which\r\ntheir beneficial operation can depend; and it seems indeed highly\r\nprobable that they act in such cases as simple diluents, for the process\r\nof digestion must necessarily deprive them of their characteristic\r\nviscidity. The administration of demulcent drinks in gonorrhæa is\r\nprobably of no farther service in assuaging the _ardor urinæ_, than an\r\nequivalent quantity of pure water; although Dr. Murray observes, “it is\r\nsufficiently certain, that many substances, which undergo the process of\r\ndigestion, are afterwards separated in their entire state from the\r\nblood, by particular secreting organs; and there is, continues he, no\r\ngland which has this power more particularly than the kidneys;\r\nsubstances received into the stomach and digested, afterwards passing\r\noff in the urine with all their peculiar properties.” This is\r\nundoubtedly very true, but mucilaginous substances rarely or never pass\r\noff in this manner; if they evade the assimilative functions, they pass\r\nthrough the alimentary canal, and are thus eliminated. I can state, as\r\nthe result of experiment, that the urine undergoes no change except in\r\nthe relative proportion of its water, by the copious and repeated\r\nadministration of mild mucilages. Dr. Saunders has very justly remarked\r\nthat the long list of _Ptisans_, _Decoctions_, _&c._ usually prescribed\r\nupon these occasions, generally owe their virtues to the watery diluent\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nThe pharmaceutical applications of this class of medicines constitute,\r\nperhaps, not the least part of their value, by which we are enabled to\r\nintroduce acrid substances into the stomach with safety and effect; but\r\nsuch services will more properly fall under our notice in a future part\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               DILUENTS:\r\n\r\nWatery liquors, which increase the fluidity of the blood, and render\r\nseveral of the secreted and excreted fluids less viscid.\r\n\r\nThere are certainly few remedies whose operation is more simple,\r\nobvious, or important; and yet there are scarcely any whose value has\r\nbeen more mistaken, or whose application has been so frequently\r\nperverted through the suggestions of false theory; water is the\r\nuniversal beverage of animals, and the necessity of its supply is\r\nindicated by thirst, a sensation which in excess, is borne with less\r\ntranquillity even than that of hunger; in certain morbid states of the\r\nbody its presence is to be regarded as indicating the necessity of\r\ncopious potation; and yet how often has the prejudiced physician, under\r\nsuch circumstances, aggravated the pressure of disease, by adding the\r\nsufferings of Tantalus. In febrile affections, the irritation of thirst\r\ntends to keep up the disease, and hence diluents, besides the other\r\nbeneficial effects which they may produce, must be regarded as important\r\nremedies. There are also diseases of the alimentary canal which may be\r\nremoved by the same agents; when water is conveyed into the intestines\r\nit will have a tendency, by mixing with, and diluting the biliary\r\nsecretion, to diminish its acrimony, and thus to obviate a source of\r\nmorbid irritation; the dilution of the chyme and chyle may also have a\r\nsalutary tendency, and favour the absorption of the finer and more\r\nnutritive parts of the lacteals; and by increasing the fluidity of the\r\nmass, expedite the numerous combinations which it is destined to\r\nundergo. The blood itself is also thus modified in its fluidity;\r\nalthough it has been very truly observed that in healthy bodies, or such\r\nas are without any obstruction of the excretions, an unusual distension\r\nof the vessels cannot be produced, or at least long subsist; for it is\r\nevident that such an increased quantity of water in the blood will\r\nimmediately pass off by one or other of the excretions; this effect,\r\nhowever, in itself, renders the operation of diluents of signal service\r\nin the treatment of the disease; in consequence, for instance, of their\r\ndisposition to pass off by urine, they furnish valuable resources in\r\ndiseases of the urinary organs, allaying the pain of strangury, and the\r\nirritation from an inflamed bladder. From these observations, the\r\npractitioner will be led to appreciate the value of diluents; and many\r\nof the beneficial effects which are daily experienced from the copious\r\npotation of mineral waters, are, without doubt, to be wholly attributed\r\nto simple dilution. See _Aqua_.\r\n\r\nIt is here necessary to say a few words upon the misapplication of this\r\norder of remedies. Dr. Davy found by experiment that when an animal is\r\nbled to death, the last portions of blood that flow are of a much lower\r\nspecific gravity than that which flows first, in consequence of the\r\nformer containing more water, which it may be inferred was derived by\r\nthe increased activity of the absorbents, exerted chiefly on mucous and\r\nserous membranes. Since then venesection promotes and accelerates\r\nabsorption,[236] it is clear that, in inflammatory diseases, where we\r\nhave recourse to blood-letting, in order to diminish the volume of\r\ncirculating fluids, we ought not to suffer the patient to indulge in an\r\nunrestrained use of liquids, which he eagerly demands to satisfy a\r\nthirst which, in all probability, is the natural consequence of\r\nincreased absorption. In such cases, it is often better to take liquids\r\nin small divided doses, which will have the effect of moderating the\r\nthirst, without overloading the arterial system, and bringing on that\r\ntension and plenitude which are liable to be produced by swallowing too\r\nlarge a proportion of liquids.\r\n\r\nIn the use of water upon such occasions, it may moreover be observed,\r\nthat its temperature ought to be attended to; as a general rule it may\r\nbe laid down, that in the _cold_ stage it should be hot, in the _hot_,\r\ncold, and in the _sweating_, tepid.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the value of diluents, as capable of promoting the\r\noperation of other remedies, many observations of great practical\r\nimportance might be adduced; but this subject will be more properly\r\nelucidated when we come to consider the influence of solubility in\r\nmodifying the activity of medicinal substances, and which constitutes a\r\nvery curious and interesting object of chemico-medical enquiry.\r\n\r\nWhile speaking of Diluents it may be cursorily noticed, that water\r\nappears, under certain circumstances of the body, to suffer\r\ndecomposition, and to have its elements appropriated to new\r\ncombinations. Count Rumford has endeavoured to prove, that the\r\nsurprisingly small quantity of solid food which is sufficient for\r\nnourishment, when converted into rich and palatable soup, is owing to\r\nthe culinary process having prepared the water for chemical\r\ndecomposition,[237] and that this is ultimately effected during the act\r\nof Digestion.[238] It cannot be denied that the exorbitant potation of\r\nwater has a tendency to produce fat, but this may depend upon the\r\nvascular distention which is thus occasioned. Gin drinkers, before they\r\nbecome materially injured by the habit, grow extremely corpulent, as may\r\noften be witnessed in unfortunate cyprians of the lower orders. Can the\r\nhydrogen of the spirit contribute to this effect?\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EMOLLIENTS:\r\n\r\nSubstances whose application diminishes the force of cohesion in the\r\nparticles of the solid matter of the human body, and thereby renders\r\nthem more lax and flexible.\r\n\r\nAccording to this definition, which we derive from Dr. Cullen, the\r\nprimary operation of emollients would appear to be purely mechanical,\r\nfor they are insinuated into the matter of the solid fibre, and either\r\ndiminish its density, or lessen the friction between its particles; this\r\nexplanation will undoubtedly apply to those emollients which consist of\r\nunctuous bodies, and which are introduced into the animal fibre by\r\nfriction; but it is evident that the beneficial effects of _Cataplasms_\r\nand _Fomentations_ cannot be so explained; for in these instances, none\r\nof the materials can be absorbed through the entire cuticle; and yet the\r\nrelaxation and consequent ease which such warm applications produce on\r\ninflamed surfaces is very considerable, but it must be wholly attributed\r\nto the relaxing effects of warmth and moisture upon the extreme vessels\r\nof the surface, propagated by _contiguous sympathy_ to the deeper seated\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nThe operation of those substances which afford relief to excoriated\r\nsurfaces by their bland qualities, as mucilaginous lotions in\r\nerysipelatous affections, is too obvious to require explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving thus investigated the manner in which medicinal substances\r\nproduce their effects upon the living system, we shall be better\r\nprepared to appreciate the advantages which are to be derived from their\r\ncombination with each other, and to escape the too common error of\r\nuniting in one formula, remedies which are rendered adverse by the\r\nincompatibility of their physiological actions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ON THE\r\n\r\n                             THEORY AND ART\r\n\r\n                                   OF\r\n\r\n                              PRESCRIBING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 “_To know\r\n               “That which before us lies in daily life,\r\n               “Is the prime wisdom._”\r\n                                           MILTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ON THE\r\n                             THEORY AND ART\r\n                                   OF\r\n                              PRESCRIBING.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OF MEDICINAL COMBINATION.\r\n\r\n  “_Variorum mixtura novas sæpe vires generet, in simplicibus nequaquam\r\n      reperiundas longe saluberrimas._”\r\n\r\n                                                                GAUBIUS.\r\n\r\nIt is a truth universally admitted, that the arm of physic has derived\r\nmuch additional power and increased energy, from the resources which are\r\nfurnished by the mixture and combination of medicinal bodies. I by no\r\nmeans intend to insinuate that the physician cannot frequently fulfil\r\nhis most important indications by the administration of one simple\r\nremedy; I only contend that, in many cases, by its scientific\r\ncombination with other medicines, it will not only act with greater\r\ncertainty and less inconvenience, but that its sphere of influence may\r\nbe thus more widely extended, and its powers so modified or changed, as\r\nto give rise to a remedy of new powers. Such a theory is amply justified\r\nby the state of combination in which certain medicinal principles are\r\nfound in our more efficient vegetable remedies, while the medicinal\r\npractice founded upon it is thus, as it were, sanctioned by Nature’s own\r\nprescriptions; enter but her laboratory, and you will soon be satisfied,\r\nthat many of her potent remedies do not owe their valuable powers to any\r\none specific ingredient, but to the combined or modified energies of\r\nvarious, and sometimes opposite principles. This view of the subject\r\nopens an interesting and unexplored field[239] of medical and chemical\r\nresearch, and I shall endeavour to avail myself of the novelties its\r\ninvestigation may present, and of the hints it may suggest for the\r\nimprovement of _extemporaneous combination_. By contemplating the laws\r\nby which Nature effects her wise purposes, we may learn to emulate her\r\nprocesses, and even in some cases to correct and assist her\r\noperations:[240] such at least has been the happy result of our labours\r\nin the other departments of natural knowledge. It is said for instance\r\nthat by observing the means used by nature for preventing the diffusion\r\nof light in the eye-ball, Euler derived an important hint for the\r\nimprovement of his telescope; and more lately, the structure of the\r\ncrystalline humour of the eye has been successfully imitated in the\r\ninvention of achromatic lenses. On the other hand, it is hardly\r\nnecessary to observe to what extent these instruments of art are capable\r\nof improving and multiplying the powers of that natural organ, to the\r\ncontemplation of whose structure and functions, we are, as I have just\r\nstated, so greatly indebted for their origin and perfection. So shall I\r\nendeavour to shew, in the progress of this work, that the combinations\r\nof nature, as exemplified in her more valuable remedies, are capable, if\r\nproperly studied, of suggesting many important hints for improving the\r\narrangements of art; while art in return may frequently supply the\r\ndefects, or extend the advantages of natural compounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              AN ANALYSIS\r\n                                   OF\r\nTHE OBJECTS TO BE OBTAINED BY MIXING AND COMBINING MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\nThe objects to be attained, and the resources which are furnished, by\r\nMEDICINAL COMBINATION, together with the different modes of its\r\noperation, and the laws by which it is governed, may with much practical\r\nadvantage be arranged in the following order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n       TO PROMOTE THE ACTION OF THE BASIS, OR PRINCIPAL MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.—_By combining together several different Forms, or Preparations, of\r\nthe same substance_.\r\n\r\nThe utility of such a combination is obvious, whenever we desire the\r\nfull and general effects of _all_ the principles of a medicinal body in\r\nsolution; thus, where the _Bark_ is required in the cure of an\r\nintermittent fever, and the stomach will not allow the exhibition of the\r\npowder, it will be eligible to conjoin in one formula, the tincture,\r\ndecoction, and extract, as exemplified by _Formulæ 42, 126, 127_. The\r\nnecessity of such a combination may be expressed by the following canon.\r\n_Whenever the chemical nature of the medicinal substance will not admit\r\nof the full solution of all its active principles in any_ ONE _Solvent_,\r\n_and its exhibition in substance is at the same time impracticable_. For\r\nfarther illustrations see _Form. 2, 25, 33, 38, 70, 109_.\r\n\r\nPractitoners, probably without having reasoned upon the theory, have\r\nvery generally adopted the practice, of combining the different\r\nsolutions of the same substance; for in the prescriptions of practical\r\nphysicians we commonly find, that the decoction or infusion of a\r\nvegetable remedy is quickened by a certain portion of a corresponding\r\ntincture.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.—_By combining the Basis with Substances which are of the_ SAME\r\nNATURE, _that is, which are_ INDIVIDUALLY _capable of producing the same\r\neffect, but with less energy than when in combination with each other._\r\n\r\nDr. FORDYCE first established the existence of the singular and\r\nimportant law, that _a combination of similar[241] remedies will produce\r\na more certain, speedy, and considerable effect than an equivalent dose\r\nof any single one_; a fact which does not appear to have been known to\r\nany ancient physician. The earliest mention of it that I can find is by\r\nVALISNIERI, the favourite pupil of Malpighi, who filled the medical\r\nchair at Padua in 1711, nearly ninety years before Fordyce published his\r\nvaluable memoir on the combination of medicines, but he does not attempt\r\nany generalization[242] of the subject; he merely states, as the result\r\nof careful experiments, that twelve drachms of _Cassia Pulp_ are about\r\nequivalent in purgative strength to four ounces of _Manna_; and yet,\r\nsays he, if we give eight drachms of _Cassia Pulp_, in combination with\r\nfour drachms of _Manna_, we obtain double the effect! How, adds the\r\nprofessor, can this possibly happen? Surely the very contrary _ought_ to\r\nobtain, since four drachms of _Cassia_ are much more than equivalent to\r\nan equal weight of _Manna_; the strength of the former being to that of\r\nthe latter as 8 to 3.\r\n\r\nThe truth of this law of medicinal combination must be continually felt\r\nby the practitioner in the ordinary routine of his practice, viz.\r\n\r\nNARCOTICS will better fulfil the intention of allaying irritation and\r\npain, when composed of several of such medicines in combination, than\r\nwhen they consist of any single one, even should the dose, in this\r\nlatter case, be increased. See _Formulæ 3, 4, 5_.\r\n\r\nANTISPASMODICS acquire increased efficacy by the application of the same\r\nprinciple. _Form. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25_.\r\n\r\nBITTER TONICS are also thus exalted, see _Form. 39, 40, 41_. The\r\nbeneficial effects, however, which arise from combinations of this kind\r\nwill admit of a satisfactory explanation upon another principle; we may,\r\nfor instance, consider them as medicines, differing from each other in\r\ntheir composition, and producing by their union an assemblage of bitter,\r\nastringent, and aromatic principles.\r\n\r\nAROMATIC and DIFFUSIBLE STIMULANTS. There are perhaps no remedies which\r\nreceive greater mutual benefit be intermixture with each other, than the\r\nindividuals which compose this class; for they not only thus acquire\r\nincreased force and efficacy, but at the same time they lose much of\r\ntheir acrimony; if, for instance, any one spice, as the dried capsule of\r\nthe _Capsicum_, be taken into the stomach, it will excite a sense of\r\nheat and pain; in like manner will a quantity of _Black Pepper_; but if\r\nan equivalent quantity of these two stimulants be given in combination\r\nwith each other, no such sense of pain is produced, but, on the\r\ncontrary, a pleasant warmth is experienced, and a genial glow felt over\r\nthe whole body; and if a greater number of spices be joined together,\r\nthe chance of pain and inflammation being produced is still farther\r\ndiminished. The truth of this law is also strikingly illustrated, as Dr.\r\nFordyce has observed, by that universal maxim in cookery, _never to\r\nemploy one spice, if more can be procured_; the object, in this case,\r\nbeing to make the stomach bear a large quantity of food without\r\nnausea.[243] This same principle also finds an illustration of its\r\nimportance, as it regards the class of stimulants, in the following\r\npreparations of our Pharmacopœia, viz. “_Pulvis Cinnamomi Compositus_;\r\n_Infusum Armoraciæ compositum_; _Infusum Aurantii Compositum_; _Spiritus\r\nLavendulæ compositus_; _Tinctura Cinchonæ composita_; _Tinctura\r\nValeriana Ammoniata_; and the _Confectio Opii_, the elegant and\r\nscientific substitute for the celebrated _Mithridate_ or _Theriaca_. The\r\npractitioner is also referred to _Form. 45, 47_, and to _Allii Radix_.”\r\n\r\nThe local action of these stimulants would appear to be placed under the\r\ndominion of the same law, and perhaps the origin of the custom, so long\r\nobserved, of mixing together the varieties of snuff, may thus receive a\r\nplausible and philosophical explanation; certain it is that by such\r\ncombination the harsh pungency of each ingredient will be diminished,\r\nwhilst the general potency of the application, in exciting the nerves,\r\nwill be increased, and rendered more grateful; the same principle will\r\ndirect the formation of safe and efficient plaisters and lotions; the\r\n_Emplastrum Cumini_ of the London, and the _Emplastrum Aromaticum_ of\r\nthe Dublin Pharmacopœia, offer examples of its judicious application.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS. For illustrations see _Form. 51, 58_.\r\n\r\nEMETICS are certainly more efficient when composed of _Ipecacuan_ united\r\nwith _Tartarized Antimony_, or _Sulphate of Zinc_, than when they simply\r\nconsist of any one of such substances in an equivalent dose. See _Form.\r\n63, 65_.\r\n\r\nCATHARTICS not only acquire a very great increase of power by\r\ncombination with each other, but they are at the same time rendered less\r\nirritating in their operation; the _Extractum Colocynthidis compositum_\r\naffords an excellent example of a compound purgative mass being much\r\nmore active and manageable, and less liable to irritate, than any one of\r\nits components separately taken. Additional examples of this fact are\r\nfurnished by _Formulæ 70, 76, 78, 79, 81, 88_. In many cases, however,\r\nthe fact of purgatives thus accelerating and correcting each other’s\r\noperation may be explained by considering them as substances endowed\r\nwith different powers, as already demonstrated, (p. 88), and which will\r\nbe more fully considered in the third division of this Essay.\r\n\r\nDIURETICS. Under this class of medicinal agents it may be observed that,\r\n_whenever a medicine is liable to produce effects different from those\r\nwe desire, its combination with similar remedies is particularly\r\neligible_, by which the action of the basis may be directed and fixed;\r\nthus the individuals which compose the class of Diuretics are uncertain\r\nin their operation, and disposed when exhibited singly to produce\r\ndiaphoretic, and other contrary effects; it is, therefore, in such\r\ncases, highly judicious to unite several of them in one Formula, by\r\nwhich we increase their powers, and are more likely to ensure their\r\noperation. _Formulæ 101, 103, 108, 109, 110, 111, 115_, are constructed\r\nupon this principle.\r\n\r\nDIAPHORETICS. Our maxim, “VIS UNITA FORTIOR,” certainly applies with\r\nequal truth to this class of medicinal agents. _Form. 122, 124_.\r\n\r\nEXPECTORANTS. More is frequently to be gained by the co-operation of\r\nthese remedies than can be obtained by the exhibition of them\r\nseparately, as in _Form. 134, 135_.\r\n\r\nDEMULCENTS do not appear to obtain any other benefit from combination\r\nthan, occasionally, a convenience and efficacy of application arising\r\nfrom a suitable degree of consistence and solubility. See article\r\n“_Trochisci_.”\r\n\r\nThe operation of the law which has thus formed the first object of this\r\ninquiry, will be found, like every other, to have a natural and well\r\ndefined limit; it is easy to perceive that by multiplying the number of\r\ningredients too far, we shall either so increase the quantity and bulk\r\nof the medicine as to render it nauseous and cumbersome, or so reduce\r\nthe dose of each constituent as to fritter away the force and energy of\r\nthe combination.\r\n\r\nThe propriety of combining _several_ stimulants, of the diffusible\r\nclass, in _one_ formula, has been questioned on different grounds. Dr.\r\nChapman, in his work on Therapeutics, adduces some arguments on this\r\npoint, which, although they fail in establishing his general position,\r\ncertainly suggest an important exception to the practice in question;\r\n“by directing,” says he, “stimulating remedies, _separately_, we shall\r\neconomise our resources in many lingering diseases.” The justness of\r\nthis statement must be admitted to its fullest extent, and practitioners\r\nwill, on certain occasions, do well to act in conformity with the views\r\nthat suggested it; for instance, in the feeble forms of protracted\r\nfevers, where the indications are to be met with the continued action of\r\nstimulants, it will certainly be salutary to alternate the use of\r\n_camphor_, _ammonia_, and other remedies of a similar nature, in\r\npreference to presenting them all at once in combination, so that the\r\nsystem may not lose its susceptibility by the continued impression of\r\nthe same stimulant; the same motive should induce us, on particular\r\noccasions, to employ in succession different narcotics, for each of them\r\naffects sensibility in its own peculiar manner.[244] The nervous system,\r\nas _Richerand_ has very justly observed, may be compared to a soil, rich\r\nin different juices, and which requires the cultivator to plant the\r\ngerms of a diversified vegetation to develope the whole of its\r\nfecundity; to insure a perpetual return, therefore, it will be right to\r\nsow a succession of different seeds. Hoffman also has offered us some\r\nadvice upon this subject; he directs us in the treatment of chronic\r\ndiseases to suspend the administration of remedies, at intervals, and\r\nafterwards to resume them, lest the system should become _habituated_,\r\nand ultimately _insensible_ to their influence.\r\n\r\nBut there remains for our investigation a still more important\r\nprecaution respecting this law of medicinal combination;—that, in\r\ncombining substances in the manner, and for the object just related, the\r\npractitioner should be well satisfied that their medicinal virtues are\r\nin reality _practically_ SIMILAR, or he will fall into an error of the\r\nmost fatal tendency; it has been already shewn, and I hope I shall not\r\nbe considered tedious by again directing the reader’s attention to the\r\nfact, that medicines are not necessarily similar because they have been\r\narranged in the same artificial division of remedies; in order to\r\nestablish a perfect similarity _their operations must be found by\r\nexperience to continue similar under every condition of the human body;\r\nand that, moreover, they must owe such similarity to modes of operation\r\nwhich are compatible with each other, and consonant with the general\r\nmode of cure_; we have only to refer to the history of Diuretics (_page\r\n92_) for a full illustration of this important truth; thus _Squill_,\r\n_Calomel_, and _Digitalis_, are each powerful Diuretics, but\r\nnevertheless they cannot be considered _similar_ remedies, since\r\n_Digitalis_ will entirely fail in its effects in the very cases that\r\n_Calomel and Squill_ succeed; and _Squill_ will prove inert when\r\n_Digitalis_ is capable of producing the most powerful influence; this\r\narises from their modes of operation being dissimilar, and consequently\r\nrequiring for their success such different states of the living system.\r\n_Squill_, it will be seen, acts _primarily_ on the urinary organs, by\r\nstimulating the secreting vessels of the kidneys; _Mercury_, on the\r\ncontrary, acts primarily on the absorbents, and _secondarily_ on the\r\nkidneys; whereas _Digitalis_ produces its effects by diminishing\r\narterial action, and increasing that of absorption.\r\n\r\nDr. Blackall, in his “Observations upon the Cure of Dropsies,” has\r\noffered some remarks so valuable in themselves, and so illustrative of\r\nthis important subject, that I shall take leave to quote the passage.\r\n“Many physicians,” he observes, “are fond of combining _Squill_,\r\n_Calomel_, and _Digitalis_, as a diuretic in dropsy; a practice unsafe,\r\nand not very decidedly possessing the merit even of being consistent.\r\n_Digitalis_ greatly depresses the action of the heart and arteries, and\r\ncontrols the circulation, and it seems most unreasonable to believe that\r\nits curative powers can be independent of such an effect; on the other\r\nhand, _Mercury_, if it does not pass off quickly, is always exciting\r\nfever, and raising and hardening the pulse; speaking from experience,\r\nwhere the urine is coaguable, and _Digitalis_ agrees, both the others\r\nare, often at least, positively injurious. On the contrary, where the\r\nurine is foul, and not coaguable, and _Squills_ with _Calomel_ render\r\nservice, I have on that very account, made less trial of Digitalis, and\r\ncannot therefore speak of it from much experience.” See _Form. 103_, and\r\nthe _note_ thereon.\r\n\r\nThe individual medicines which compose the class of DIAPHORETICS vary no\r\nless in their primary operations, as the synoptical arrangement at _page\r\n99_ very fully exemplifies; thus, in the cure of intermittent fevers,\r\ndiaphoretics are useful both in the paroxysm, and during the\r\nintermission; in the first case they shorten its duration; in the second\r\nthey support the tone of the extreme vessels, and prevent its\r\nrecurrence; but in these opposite states of disease a very different\r\nkind of diaphoretic is required—to fulfil the first indication, a\r\ncooling and relaxing one is necessary; to answer the second, the\r\nstimulating diaphoretic is exacted; the one may be said to _solicit_,\r\nthe other to _extort_, perspiration. So again EMMENAGOGUES can only be\r\nconsidered relative agents, since the suppression of the catamenia may\r\ndepend upon, or be connected with, very different states of the system;\r\nin some cases with a diminished, and in others with an increased state\r\nof excitement; for on many occasions the suppression of the menses is\r\nthe effect, and not the cause of disease; _Boerhaave_ has very justly\r\nobserved, that it is a most dangerous error to ascribe all the diseases\r\nof young females to a retention of the catamenia, which often do not\r\nappear because the patients are disordered from other causes. If,\r\ntherefore, we were to attempt a combination of the several medicines\r\nwhich have gained reputation as _Emmenagogues_, it is very obvious, that\r\nwe should bring together an assemblage of adverse and incompatible\r\nremedies; nor would the physician be less inconsistent were he to\r\ncombine EXPECTORANTS, without a due regard to their modes of operation;\r\nit is only necessary to observe their classification, as presented at\r\npage 102, to become satisfied how greatly the success of such remedies\r\nmust depend upon their scientific adaptation to each particular case.\r\n\r\nThe class of ANTISPASMODICS may likewise embrace remedies of the most\r\nopposite tendency, for spasm may occur under the most opposite\r\ncircumstances—in an extreme condition of weakness, as in nervous\r\naffections, and in an highly excited state, as in cholic, &c.; it is\r\nhardly necessary, therefore, to point out the mischief that must arise\r\nfrom the fortuitous and indiscriminate admixture of the individual\r\nsubstances which are thus unavoidably arranged in the same artificial\r\nclassification. _Bark_ and _Steel_ are also too often considered as\r\nequivalent _Tonics_; in Dropsy, says Dr. Blackall, it is far otherwise,\r\nthe former being infinitely to be preferred after the dropsy of young\r\npersons, of acute disease, and of sound stamina; the latter being suited\r\nto a vitiated rather than to a feeble habit, and indicated more by a\r\npale sallow complexion, and a want of red colour in the blood, as shewn\r\nby the paleness of the lips, than by any other signs. Need we then\r\nadduce farther illustrations of the obvious but important fact, that the\r\nterms employed to denote the different classes of remedies are\r\nfrequently but relative ones, expressive of effects which are produced\r\nonly in reference to a particular state of the living body? and as this\r\nnecessarily varies in different states of health and disease, it follows\r\nthat medicines are convertible agents, and that when we attempt to\r\ninstitute general rules respecting their administration, without taking\r\ninto consideration the constitution and circumstances of the patient\r\nupon whom they are to operate, we shall generally be disappointed in the\r\nresult. We may say of medicines what Van Swieten said of diet, “to\r\nassert that such, or such a thing be wholesome, without a knowledge of\r\nthe condition of the person for whom it is intended, is like a sailor\r\npronouncing the wind to be fair without knowing to what port the vessel\r\nis bound.” Boerhaave was so fully impressed with this truth that he\r\nexclaimed, “_nullum ego cognosco remedium, nisi quod tempestivo usu fiat\r\ntale_.”\r\n\r\nAlthough medicines which produce the same ultimate effects by modes of\r\noperation obviously different, cannot be considered SIMILAR, in the\r\nsense affixed to the term in the present section, yet if these different\r\nmodes of operation be not physiologically incompatible with each other,\r\nthe union of such remedies may not only be admissible, but even useful;\r\nand it will, accordingly, constitute an object of inquiry in a\r\nsucceeding section. (III. A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nC.—_By combining the Basis with Substances of a_ DIFFERENT NATURE, _and\r\nwhich do not exert any Chemical influence upon it, but are found, by\r\nexperience, to be capable of rendering the Stomach, or System, or any\r\nparticular organ, more susceptible of its action_.\r\n\r\nThus it is that the system is rendered more susceptible of the influence\r\nof Mercury, by combining it with Antimony and Opium.[245] Where the\r\nstomach is insensible to impressions, the exhibition of Opium previous\r\nto, or in combination with, any active medicine, often assists its\r\noperation; this is remarkably striking in some states of mania, when\r\nemetics will fail, unless the stomach be previously influenced and\r\nprepared by a narcotic; indeed, in ordinary cases of inirritability of\r\nstomach, the addition of a small quantity of opium will often render an\r\nemetic active.[246]\r\n\r\nSo again the system, when it is in that particular condition which is\r\nindicated by a hot and dry skin, is unsusceptible of the expectorant\r\npowers of Squill, unless it be in union with antimony or some powerful\r\ndiaphoretic, (_Form. 134_.) Squill is by no means disposed to act upon\r\nthe urinary organs, when exhibited singly; but calomel, and some other\r\nmercurial preparations,[247] when in conjunction with it, appear to\r\ndirect its influence to the kidneys, and to render these organs more\r\nsusceptible of its operation; (103, 106.) Upon the same principle,\r\n_Antimonial Wine_ quickens the operation of saline cathartics (69);\r\n_Opium_ increases the sudorific powers of _Antimony_ (124); and the\r\npurgative operation of _Jalap_ is promoted by _Ipecacuan_ (84). Dr.\r\nAikin asserts that fifteen grains of the former purgative when combined\r\nwith two or three grains of the latter root, will purge more than double\r\nthat quantity of Jalap when administered without such an adjunct.\r\n\r\nSir John Pringle speaks of the advantages which may be obtained by\r\ncombining an alkali with a bitter infusion, by which the diuretic\r\neffects of the former will be increased, while the latter is calculated\r\nto remove any gastric debility, and to impart a general tone to the\r\nbody: there is no doubt but that _Bitters_, from their invigorating\r\ninfluence upon the _primæ viæ_, (_see page 78_) increase the effects of\r\nremedies whose operation is connected with changes _in transitu_, or\r\nwith absorption, as in the exhibition of certain diuretics;[248] they\r\nalso frequently render the stomach and bowels more susceptible of bodies\r\nthat act by impression, as purgatives, emetics, &c.\r\n\r\nWe may discover the operation of such a principle in some of the more\r\nactive compounds presented to us by nature: many herbs owe their\r\nefficacy to a cause of this kind. _Elaterium_, as I have ascertained by\r\nexperiment, contains a purgative element, _sui generis_, (_Elatin_) and\r\na bitter principle, which in itself is quite inert, and yet its presence\r\nin the compound renders the alimentary canal more susceptible of the\r\nimpression of the active ingredient, and therefore increases its force.\r\nSee _Extract_. _Elaterii._ The history of _Senna_ will afford some\r\ninteresting facts in farther elucidation of this subject; the leaves of\r\nthis plant, like _Elaterium_, appear to contain an active principle, in\r\ncombination with a bitter, which latter ingredient, although destitute\r\nof purgative properties, considerably increases those of the former; for\r\nif this be removed, as happens when Senna is transplanted into the south\r\nof France, the purgative principle is weakened, but may be again\r\nrestored by the artificial addition of some bitter extractive. The fruit\r\nor pods of Senna[249] contain only the purgative principle, and are\r\ntherefore comparatively feeble, unless the defect be compensated by art.\r\nDr. Cullen has observed that a much smaller quantity of the leaves is\r\nrequired for a dose if they be infused in company with some bitter\r\nplant; and it has been found that the watery infusion of _Rhubarb_ is\r\nrendered more purgative by the addition of _Calumba_.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Seguin have established beyond all doubt that the\r\nactive principle of vegetable astringents is a peculiar element, to\r\nwhich the name of _Tannin_ has been given; but the efficacy of this\r\ningredient is undoubtedly enhanced by the presence of the gallic acid\r\nwith which it is usually associated, although this acid, when separated\r\nfrom the native combination, is incapable of producing the least\r\nastringent effect; that peculiar flavour which we so commonly experience\r\nin unripe fruits, and which we designate by the term _acerbness_, is the\r\nresult of a combination of the astringent principle with some vegetable\r\nacid. The relative sweetness of sugar, when in different degrees of\r\npurity, depends upon the operation of the same law of combination; _pure\r\nsugar_, as Dr. Mac Culloch has very justly observed, however paradoxical\r\nit may appear, _is not so sweet as that which is impure_; the sweetness\r\nof _melasses_, compared with that of refined sugar, is too well known to\r\nrequire more than a bare mention; the vegetable extractive matter in\r\nthis case, increases the effect of the saccharine principle with which\r\nit is combined; for the same reason grapes, differing very materially in\r\ntheir proportion of saccharine matter, may seem _to the taste_ equally\r\nsweet, and such in fact is the case on comparing the luscious grapes of\r\nSpain, with the _Chasselas_ of Paris; and yet the vinous produce is\r\nentirely different, the result of the one being a sweet and luscious\r\nwine, while that of the other is hard and dry, because, in truth, these\r\ngrapes contain very different proportions of sugar; and however\r\npowerfully the extractive matter may modify the effects of this\r\nprinciple upon the palate and organs of taste, it cannot alter the\r\nquantity of alcohol resulting from its fermentation.[250] Crystallized\r\nsugar also appears less sweet to the taste than loaf sugar, but this may\r\ndepend upon the different state of aggregation, and, consequently, the\r\ndifferent degrees of solubility possessed by the sugar in these two\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the addition of certain bodies will induce the absorbents\r\nto admit and carry into the circulation remedies which, in a more simple\r\nstate, they would reject as injurious; this position is supported by the\r\nfact of mercury being more readily absorbed when in combination with\r\nanimal matter, see _Ung: Hydrarg:_ and it is probable that iron, in the\r\nform of a _tanno-gallate_, will be more acceptable than when presented\r\nin a more purely mineral state: see _Ferri Sulphas_.\r\n\r\nDoes it not therefore appear from the preceding remarks, that _certain\r\nelements exist in the composition of vegetable remedies, as furnished by\r\nnature, which, although individually inert, confer additional strength\r\nand impulse upon the principle of activity with which they are\r\nassociated_.[251]\r\n\r\nThe solutions of saline cathartics appear likewise to gain an accession\r\nof power and celerity of operation by impregnation with _Carbonic acid\r\ngas_, depending probably upon the intestines thus receiving a degree of\r\ndistention favourable to the action of the salt, (19, 23.) Certain it is\r\nthat the operation of emetics, as well as that of glysters, is\r\nmaterially increased by the stimulus of distention.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the methods to be adopted for increasing the energies of\r\na remedy, by rendering the system more susceptible of its action, it is\r\nright to know that, under certain circumstances, Venesection deserves a\r\ndistinguished rank amongst the ADJUVANTIA. The fact is strikingly\r\ndiscovered in the exhibition of _Mercurial[252] Preparations_, and some\r\nother alterative medicines. Whether the “_Vis Conservatrix_,” which\r\nNature, when in a state of health and vigour, opposes to the admission\r\nof poisonous substances into the circulation, be overcome by\r\nblood-letting, is a question which I shall leave others to decide; but\r\nthus much reiterated practice has taught me, that the system in a strong\r\nand healthy condition frequently is overcome the moment the stomach\r\nbecomes deranged, the circulation languid, or the general tone of the\r\nsystem impaired. I have frequently seen this during my Hospital\r\npractice: if a patient who has been using mercurial friction, or taking\r\nthe preparations of that metal without effect, be transferred into a\r\nclose and unhealthy ward, his appetite soon fails, the tongue becomes\r\nfurred, and the system instantly yields to the influence of the remedy.\r\nNauseating doses of _antimony_[253] frequently repeated, or the\r\naccidental supervention of any disease of debility, will be attended\r\nwith the same phenomena. My practice has also afforded me an opportunity\r\nof appreciating the debilitating effects of despondency in a case of\r\nthis description; a patient had been taking mercurial medicines, and\r\nusing frictions for a considerable period, without any apparent effect:\r\nunder these circumstances he was abruptly told that he would fall a\r\nvictim to his disease; the unhappy man experienced an unusual shock at\r\nthis opinion, and in a few hours became violently salivated.[254]\r\n\r\nVENESECTION, moreover, increases the effects of cathartic medicines. I\r\nhave often noticed this fact in contending with a plethoric diathesis;\r\nwhenever the bleeding preceded the purgative, the effects of the latter\r\nhave been uniformly more speedy and considerable; in obstinate\r\nconstipation the same fact has been observed, and mild remedies have\r\nbeen known to act more powerfully, when preceded by blood-letting, than\r\npotent ones have when exhibited antecedent to it. Venesection has\r\ncertainly an extraordinary power in awakening the susceptibility of the\r\n_primæ viæ_ to remedial impressions; in some diseases, as in the\r\n_Cynanche Trachealis_, or Croup, so great is the insensibility of the\r\nstomach, that Emetics frequently fail in their effects; and Dr. Hamilton\r\nhas given as much as a hundred grains of _Calomel_ in the twenty-four\r\nhours: in such cases previous venesection affords most extraordinary\r\nassistance. Dr. Fothergill also remarks that emetics are more beneficial\r\nafter bleeding, (_Dissert. Med. Inaug. de Emet. usu._) The effects of\r\n_Bark_, _Steel_, and other tonics, are certainly influenced in the same\r\nmanner; whether in any case it may be prudent or judicious to have\r\nrecourse to such a practice, is a question not immediately connected\r\nwith the present inquiry.\r\n\r\nLimited must have been the experience of that practitioner who has not\r\nfrequently witnessed the utility of Venesection in producing a state of\r\nsystem favourable to the operation of various remedies. In acute\r\ndiseases, how frequently does an opiate succeed in allaying irritation\r\nafter copious bleeding, which could not be made to occasion any\r\nbeneficial influence previous to that operation? In Pneumonia I have\r\nrepeatedly seen such a plan of treatment act like a charm upon the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nPURGATIVES also awaken the susceptibility of the body to mercurial\r\nimpressions, and it is remarked by Dr. Chapman that this practice\r\naffords a resource which rarely disappoints the practitioner. This class\r\nof remedies moreover seems capable of exalting the efficacy, and indeed\r\nof accelerating the benefit to be derived from many alteratives, when\r\nadministered _previous_ to the exhibition of these latter substances;\r\nthe advantages of a course of Steel medicines are undoubtedly increased\r\nby such means. The febrifugous and antiseptic properties of diluted\r\nmuriatic acid (see _Form. 145_.) are inconsiderable, unless its\r\nexhibition be accompanied with cathartics. I beg to refer the\r\npractitioner to some cases published by me in the _Medical and Physical\r\nJournal for December_, 1809, in further illustration of these views.\r\nExperience enables me also to state that _Diuretics_ are considerably\r\nassisted by similar means, having many instances in my case book of the\r\nfailure of these agents before, and their successful operation after,\r\nthe exhibition of a cathartic. Dr. Darwin observes that “_Absorptions\r\nare always increased by Inanition_,” and in support of this position\r\nrefers to the frequent advantage derived from evacuations in the cure of\r\nulcers. I have certainly seen obstinate sores in the leg cured by small\r\nand repeated bleedings. Dr. Chapman arrives at the same conclusion,\r\nalthough by a different train of reasoning; he states that the\r\nblood-vessels and absorbents[255] are to a certain extent “antagonising\r\npowers:” instructed by this obvious fact, we ought, says he, in the\r\nexhibition of diuretics to regulate the state of the system by\r\ninterposing purgatives, or even venesection, as the state of the\r\ncirculation may indicate.\r\n\r\nEMETICS also, in certain conditions of the system, would appear to\r\nrender the stomach more sensible to the impression of other remedies;\r\nDr. Eberle, of Philadelphia,[256] has remarked such an effect with\r\nrespect to the administration of the Peruvian Bark.\r\n\r\nCHANGE OF DIET AND OF HABITS may be also classed amongst the\r\n_Ajuvantia_, but the young practitioner must be warned that he is not to\r\nexercise his _Caduceus_ as Sancho’s Doctor did his wand. I have seen a\r\nyoung disciple of Esculapius so vex his patient, that his food became\r\nmore nauseous to him than his medicine, and I verily believe his\r\nPhysician was more irksome than his disease. It was well observed by Dr.\r\nPercival that the prejudices of the sick should never be contemned with\r\nwantonness, or opposed with harshness; for, silenced by authority, they\r\nwill operate secretly and forcibly on the mind, creating fear, anxiety,\r\nand watchfulness. And with regard to diet it may be here stated, that no\r\nfunction of the body is so materially influenced by mental impressions\r\nas that series of actions constituting what is termed _Digestion_—the\r\nunexpected communication of any distressing event destroys the keenest\r\nappetite,[257] and converts the sensation of hunger into one of disgust\r\nat the bare idea of food: a fact which did not escape the penetrating\r\neye of our immortal Shakespeare, for he represents Henry dismissing\r\nWolsey from his government with these words—\r\n\r\n                             —— Read o’er this;\r\n                 And after, this: and then to breakfast\r\n                 _with what appetite_ you have.\r\n\r\nIf feelings of disgust are excited by the repast, the stomach will never\r\nact with healthy energy on the ingesta; and in cases of extreme\r\naversion, they are either returned, or they pass through the alimentary\r\ncanal almost unchanged: on the other hand, the gratification which\r\nattends a favourite meal is in itself a specific stimulus to the organs\r\nof digestion, especially in weak and debilitated habits. Dr. Merriman\r\nhas lately communicated to me a case which affords a striking\r\nillustration of the powerful influence of the mind upon these organs: a\r\nlady of rank labouring under menorrhagia, suffered with that irritable\r\nand unrelenting state of stomach which so commonly attends that disease,\r\nand to such a degree that every kind of aliment and medicine was alike\r\nrejected: after the total failure of the usual expedients to appease the\r\nstomach and procure relief, she applied to Miss Prescott, and was\r\n_magnetised_, when she immediately, to the astonishment of all her\r\nfriends, ate a beef steak, and continued to repeat the meal every day\r\nfor six weeks, without the least inconvenience! but the disease itself,\r\nnotwithstanding this treacherous amnesty of the stomach, continued with\r\nunabated violence, and shortly afterwards terminated her life.\r\n\r\nThe diet of a sick person ought never to _combine too much nutriment in\r\ntoo small a space_;[258] when so given it will even in health be\r\nfollowed by _fermentation_ instead of _digestion_; and although we may\r\nadmit the expediency of that domestic maxim, “_a little and often_,” yet\r\nthis is to be received with limitation; no one, for instance, who\r\npossesses any philosophical knowledge, will adapt his practice to the\r\nnotions of Sir William Temple, who asserted that “the stomach of a\r\nvaletudinarian was like a school-boy, always doing mischief when\r\nunemployed,” and that we should therefore not allow it any interval of\r\nrepose: to this I answer, that the conversion of aliment into blood is\r\neffected by a series of elaborate processes, several of which are only\r\nperfectly performed during the quiescence of the rest: it would seem,\r\nfor instance, that the process of _chylification_ is incompatible with\r\nthat by which the first changes are produced in the stomach; this is\r\nevident from the well-known fact, that our appetite for food ceases when\r\nthe former process commences, although the repast should, at the time,\r\nhave been insufficient to satisfy the craving of nature; whereas, in\r\ndiseases of imperfect, or depraved digestion, as in _Diabetes_, _Tabes\r\nMesenterica_, &c. we find that the appetite for food is never satisfied\r\nby the most nutritive meals. It merits notice also, that whenever the\r\nstomach be called into action during the assimilating stages of\r\ndigestion, the process will, in weak persons, be much disturbed, if not\r\nentirely suspended. These views have long since confirmed me in the\r\npropriety of treating mesenteric affections in a manner very different\r\nfrom that which is generally pursued; and I may add that the result has\r\nbeen very satisfactory. The plan to which I allude, consists in\r\nenforcing longer intervals between each meal, which should be scanty,\r\nand in quantity short of what the appetite may require; in this way are\r\nthe unwilling absorbents induced to perform their duties with greater\r\npromptitude and activity; but it is a practice which, from the extreme\r\nanxiety of friends and relatives, the feelings of craving and hunger\r\nexpressed by the patient, and the mistaken but universal prejudice\r\nrespecting diet, it is always painful to propose, and generally\r\nimpossible to enforce; where, however, circumstances have given a full\r\nand unreserved controul, the advantage of the plan has been most\r\ndecisive.\r\n\r\nThere is still another remark which I am desirous of offering, in this\r\nplace, on the subject of Diet; _viz._—that in all cases of feeble or\r\nimperfect digestion, _the Valetudinarian ought never to take his\r\nprincipal meal in a state of fatigue_—and yet let me ask, whether there\r\nis a habit more generally pursued, or more tenaciously defended? Aye,\r\nand defended too upon _principle_—the invalid merchant, the banker, the\r\nattorney, the government clerk, are all impressed with the same belief,\r\nthat after the sedentary occupations of the day, to walk several miles\r\nto their villas, or to fatigue themselves with exercise before their\r\ndinner, or rather early supper, will sharpen their tardy stomachs, and\r\ninvigorate their feeble organs of digestion. The consequence is\r\nobvious,—instead of curing, such a practice is calculated to perpetuate,\r\nand even to aggravate the malady under which they suffer; by calling\r\nupon the powers of digestion at a period, when the body is in a state of\r\nexhaustion from fatigue. Often have I, in the course of my practice in\r\nthis town, cured the Dyspeptic invalid, by merely inducing him to\r\nabandon so mischievous a habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n   TO CORRECT THE OPERATION OF THE BASIS, BY OBVIATING ANY UNPLEASANT\r\n  EFFECTS IT MIGHT BE LIKELY TO OCCASION, AND WHICH WOULD PERVERT ITS\r\n       INTENDED ACTION, AND DEFEAT THE OBJECTS OF ITS EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _By_ MECHANICALLY _separating, or_ CHEMICALLY _neutralizing, the\r\noffending Ingredient_.\r\n\r\nThe scientific physician, from his knowledge of the chemical composition\r\nof a medicine, and of the principles upon which its different qualities\r\ndepend, is enabled to remove or render inert the element which imparts\r\nto it a deleterious operation; thus it has been found that the peculiar\r\nprinciple in the _Spanish Fly_, which so frequently irritates the\r\nurinary organs, is soluble in boiling water; ebullition in water\r\ntherefore offers the means of depriving it of the power of thus acting\r\nupon the kidneys, while it does not effect any alteration in its\r\nvesicatory properties. It is upon the same principle that many vegetable\r\nsubstances of a very acrid nature, become harmless by boiling, or by\r\nchemical manipulation, and some of them might even in times of scarcity\r\nand want, be introduced as wholesome and nutritious articles of diet.\r\nThe experiments of _Westring_ shew that the bitterness of the _Lichen\r\nIslandicus_ may be entirely removed by maceration in an alkaline ley,\r\nand a tasteless, but highly nutritious fecula be thus obtained; in the\r\nsame manner the _Æsculus Hippocastanum_ (Horse Chesnut) may be deprived\r\nof its bitterness, leaving a residuum which will afford a kind of bread;\r\nand according to _Parmentier_ (_Recherches sur les vegetaux\r\nnourissans_,) excellent starch may be also made from it. _Dr. Darwin_\r\nobserves, that if the roots of _White Bryony_ be rasped into cold water,\r\nand agitated with it, the acrid juice of the root along with the\r\nmucilage will be dissolved, or swim in the water; while a starch\r\nperfectly wholesome and nutritious will subside, and may be\r\nadvantageously used as food; by a similar species of address the French\r\nprepare from the acrid _Arum_ the harmless, but highly prized cosmetic,\r\ncalled _Cyprus powder_.\r\n\r\nThere are many substances which receive a much pleasanter mode of\r\noperation by having their solubilities increased or diminished; thus the\r\ngriping occasioned by several drastic purgatives is obviated by the\r\naddition of some alkali: and the nauseating tendency of _Camboge_, which\r\narises from its too easy solubility, is prevented by incorporating it\r\nwith some insoluble body; as in the _Pilulæ Cambogiæ Comp:_ but the\r\nfarther consideration of this question will be resumed in the fourth\r\nsection of the Analysis. (iv. c.)\r\n\r\nNumerous attempts have been made to correct the inconvenient effects of\r\n_Opium_, such as nausea, head-ache, and costiveness, by removing the\r\nresinous element, upon which such evils have been supposed to depend,\r\nand we have accordingly been at different times presented with a variety\r\nof _Formulæ_ for the accomplishment of so desirable an object; (_see\r\nOpium_). More recently, opium has been discovered to possess _two_\r\nactive principles, viz. _Morphia_ and _Narcotine_, which would appear\r\nfrom the researches of M. Majendie to exert very different powers upon\r\nthe animal system; the former imparting to opium its _soporific_, the\r\nlatter, its _exciting_ property; whence it is proposed to remove this\r\nlatter principle in order to render the operation of opium milder, and\r\nat the same time to divest it of those objectionable properties which so\r\ngreatly limit its medicinal utility. _See Opium._\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _By adding some substance capable of guarding the stomach, or system,\r\nagainst its deleterious effects._\r\n\r\nThe virtues of our most important remedies are frequently lost, or much\r\ninvalidated, for want of proper attention to the circumstances\r\ncomprehended in this section. It may be almost admitted as an axiom that\r\n_whenever an_ ALTERATIVE _medicine acts with violence upon the primæ\r\nviæ, its energies are uselessly expended, and the object of its\r\nexhibition defeated_. So again, _Diaphoretics_, _Diuretics_, and many\r\nother remedies, suffer a diminution in their effects, whenever they\r\nstimulate the stomach or bowels to excess. _Guaiacum_ thus loses its\r\nanti-arthritic, _Squill_ its diuretic, and _Antimony_ and _Ipecacuan_\r\ntheir diaphoretic, virtues; the action of these substances may therefore\r\nrequire correction, and a medicine must be selected capable of\r\nfulfilling that intention. _Opium_ has very extensive powers as a\r\ncorrigent. _See Form. 57, 100, 106, 110_. Dr. Mead combined alkaline\r\nsalts, when intended to act as diuretics, with opium, in order to\r\nprevent their action upon the bowels. _Acetate of Lead_, when\r\nadministered in cases of hæmopthysis, or uterine hemorrhage, should also\r\nbe guarded by the addition of a small portion of the same narcotic. Dr.\r\nSutton, of Greenwich, has lately written a paper to shew, that where we\r\nwish to limit the operation of an emetic to the stomach, and to prevent\r\nits action on the bowels, we should add five or six drops of laudanum to\r\nthe emetic draught, which in his experience has answered the purpose in\r\nquestion.[259] The griping and nauseating tendency of some remedies\r\nreceives correction by the addition of _Aromatic stimulants_, or\r\n_Essential oils_, (69, 71, 78, 84, 85, 92,) or by small portions of a\r\ncorresponding tincture, (70, 76.) It has been already stated, that the\r\ngriping from _Senna_ and _resinous_ purgatives may be, in a great\r\ndegree, obviated by the addition of alkalies; it remains to be observed,\r\nthat the same remedies are also mitigated in severity, by _saline_\r\npurgatives, (77.) I learn from Sir Henry Halford, that in his practice\r\nhe has found the addition of _Extract of Hyoscyamus_ render the\r\noperation of the _compound extract of Colocynth_ much more mild, and no\r\nless efficacious. Of the value of such a combination, I am myself able\r\nto bear ample testimony. _Alum_ is corrected in its tendency to disturb\r\nthe bowels by the addition of _Nutmeg_, (_Form. 53_,) or some aromatic;\r\nand the drastic operation of _Colocynth_ may be mitigated by trituration\r\nwith _Camphor_. There are several substances which are deprived of their\r\nacrimonious qualities by trituration with mucilage, milk, barley-water,\r\n&c. The tendency which mercurial preparations possess of affecting the\r\nbowels, is, with the exception of _Corrosive Sublimate_, corrected by\r\n_Opium_, but the acrid operation of this latter salt is more securely\r\nguarded against by the decoction of _Guaiacum_ or _Mezereon_, or by the\r\nplentiful exhibition of mucilaginous drinks and broths. In certain\r\ndiseases of the uterus and vagina, astringent lotions are indicated, but\r\nit may happen, as in the cauliflower excrescence, or in the oozing\r\ntumour of the labium, that such applications are too irritating; in such\r\ncases the effect of the lotion is _corrected_ by the addition of\r\nmucilage. The enfeebling influence of _Digitalis_, _Tobacco_, and some\r\nother narcotics, is successfully opposed by aromatics and stimulants. It\r\nhas already been stated that several attempts have been made to correct\r\nthe operation of _Opium_ by the application of mechanical and chemical\r\nresources; it would, however, appear that, for obviating its effects\r\nupon the intestinal excretions, the judicious addition of some purgative\r\nwill offer the most effectual corrigent; and, according to my own\r\nexperience, the _Aloetic_ preparations are to be preferred upon such an\r\noccasion, as in _Form. 11, 12, 13_. In some cases, I have found that a\r\ncombination of the watery infusion of _Opium_ with some bitter, will\r\nsecure the narcotic virtues without those consecutive effects upon the\r\nalimentary canal, which we are always so desirous to obviate; the\r\n_Decoctum Aloes compositum_ also furnishes upon such an occasion a very\r\nappropriate adjunct. Let us remember that one of the effects of opium is\r\nto paralyse, for a time, the muscular fibres of the intestines: now\r\nexperience has taught us that the remedies above directed have a\r\npeculiar tendency to augment the peristaltic motions of the _primæ viæ_.\r\nUpon the same principle the addition of calomel will prevent the\r\nparalysing influence of this narcotic upon the biliary functions. I have\r\nknown several patients who could never take opium unless in such a form\r\nof combination.\r\n\r\nIn general, a formula contains but one _corrigent_; but circumstances\r\nmay occur, where two different ingredients are required to obviate two\r\nvery different effects, as in _Form. 16_, in which the _Nitric acid_ is\r\nintroduced for the purpose of counteracting the deleterious effects of\r\nthe opium upon the nervous system, while the _Aloetic_ preparation is\r\ncalculated to obviate its particular tendency upon the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nSometimes the unpleasant or perverse operation of a medicine may be\r\nobviated by changing the form of its exhibition, the period at which it\r\nis taken, or the extent of its dose; Dr. Cullen, for instance, found\r\nthat the nauseating operation of _Camboge_ might be obviated, by\r\nrepeating small doses at short intervals. (89.)\r\n\r\nBefore quitting the present subject, it deserves notice, that there is\r\nfrequently a _chemical_ condition of the stomach that may interfere with\r\nthe mild operation of a medicine, and may therefore require\r\nconsideration: this is particularly exemplified in the action of those\r\nantimonial preparations which are liable to become emetic and drastic by\r\nthe presence of an acid; it is, for this reason, very eligible to guard\r\nsuch substances with antacid adjuncts. See _Antimonii Sulphuretum_, and\r\n_Form. 125, 128_. There is also, upon some occasions, an irritable state\r\nof the _primæ viæ_ depending upon a deficient secretion of mucus, which\r\nrenders even small doses of any active medicine mischievous;\r\nmucilaginous decoctions in such a case will offer the readiest\r\n_corrigent_; see _Scammonia_.\r\n\r\nThe vinous infusion of _Colchicum_ appears to act more violently when\r\nacid is present in the stomach; small doses of _Magnesia_ may therefore\r\nprecede, and accompany its exhibition, with advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n        TO OBTAIN THE JOINT OPERATION OF TWO OR MORE MEDICINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _By uniting those substances which are calculated to produce the_\r\nSAME ULTIMATE RESULTS, _although by totally different modes of\r\noperation_.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, (_page 152_), that we may frequently combine\r\nsubstances together whose modes of operation are dissimilar, with\r\nconsiderable advantage, provided they be not physiologically\r\nincompatible with each other. We may illustrate this subject by a\r\nreference to the operation of purgatives; a series of medicinal\r\nsubstances may be produced, each of which has the property of exciting\r\ncatharsis, but by a very different mode of action; one for instance\r\nstimulates the muscular fibres of the intestines; a second acts upon the\r\nexhalant vessels, and mucous glands; and a third exerts its influence\r\nupon the neighbouring organs, so as to produce an increased flow of\r\ntheir secretions into the bowels; but since such modes of action are\r\nquite compatible with each other, they may be simultaneously\r\nestablished, not only without any loss of efficacy, but with the most\r\ndecided advantage; suppose, for instance, we administer a substance\r\nwhich, either from its insolubility or peculiar nature, acts exclusively\r\nupon the muscular fibres of the alimentary canal, its peristaltic\r\nmotions will be undoubtedly thus increased, and the contents of the\r\nbowels evacuated, but the operation will be slow, and probably\r\naccompanied with considerable _tormina_; now it is evident that if to\r\nsuch a remedy we add those which can produce an increased flow of serous\r\nfluids, the effect will be both quicker and easier. _The infusion of\r\nSenna_ is thus quickened and corrected by _Soluble Tartar_. In the same\r\nmanner various substances included in the class of diuretics, which,\r\nalthough different, still if they be not adverse in their operation, may\r\nbe conjoined; _Digitalis_ and _Potass_ are not similar, nor are they\r\nincompatible, for while the alkali, through the medium of the\r\ncirculation, stimulates the secreting organs of the kidneys, the\r\nfoxglove may, by its sympathetic action, rouse the energy of the\r\nabsorbents. In the administration of diaphoretics we shall frequently\r\nderive additional force, as well as certainty, by combining those which\r\nact by relaxing the cutaneous emunctories, with those which prove\r\ndiaphoretic by imparting a general increase of momentum to the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _By combining Medicines which have entirely different powers, and\r\nwhich are required to obviate different symptoms, or to answer different\r\nindications._\r\n\r\nArrangements constructed upon this principle constitute some of the most\r\nvaluable remedies with which we are acquainted; they are in general\r\n_extemporaneous_, because their value depends upon their being varied\r\nand modified according to the symptoms and circumstances of each\r\nparticular case. The following general elucidation of the subject may\r\nserve to demonstrate the nature and importance of such combinations.\r\n\r\nPURGATIVES _with_ ANTISPASMODICS. The practice suggested by Drs. Stoll\r\nand Warren, in the treatment of _Cholica Pictonum_, affords a striking\r\nexample of the expediency of combinations of this nature. It is found in\r\nthat disease, as well as in others attended with spasmodic constriction\r\nof the intestinal canal, that purgatives produce no effects unless the\r\nspasm be allayed by combining them with _Opium_, (_see Form. 71, 75,\r\n76_,) it is from such a cause that the purgative so popular with tailors\r\nand shoemakers, and which consists of _Aloes_ with _Sagapenum_ or\r\n_Galbanum_, affords such prompt relief in the spasmodic cholic to which\r\nthey are subject.\r\n\r\nPURGATIVES _with_ TONICS. In the exhibition of cathartics how frequently\r\nit occurs in practice that the patient’s strength will hardly allow the\r\nevacuation; in such a case the addition of _steel_ as a roborant (_Form.\r\n72, 92, 93_,) or even of _æther_, or _ammonia_, as a diffusible\r\nstimulant, is strongly indicated: the Cheltenham waters offer a natural\r\ncombination of this character. So again in the cure of dropsy we have\r\noften two indications to fulfil—to evacuate the water, and to support\r\nthe strength of the patient; hence the necessity of combining brisk and\r\nstimulating purges, such as _Scammony_, _Jalap_, &c. with active tonics,\r\n(83.) In the treatment of amenorrhæa the same medicinal arrangement is\r\nnot unfrequently indicated.\r\n\r\nPURGATIVES _with_ MERCURIAL ALTERATIVES. In habitual costiveness, where\r\nthere appears to be a deficiency of bile, a combination of _Pilula\r\nHydrargyri_, with certain _Aloetic_ compounds, may prove serviceable;\r\nfor while the latter remedy will, in the absence of bile, supply to the\r\nintestines a congenial stimulus, the former will tend to restore the\r\nbilious secretion by its influence upon the hepatic system. _See Form.\r\n79, 81_.\r\n\r\nPURGATIVES _with_ DIAPHORETICS. This combination of effects is often\r\nuseful in practice, but it is desirable that the latter should not be\r\nestablished until the operation of the purgative upon the bowels has\r\nsubsided. This is accomplished by certain doses of _Tartarized Antimony_\r\nin conjunction with some purgative. The _Pulvis Aloes Compositus_ of our\r\nPharmacopœia produces a somewhat similar effect.\r\n\r\nDIAPHORETICS _with_ TONICS. How frequently is the practitioner desirous\r\nof determining to the skin, and at the same time of supporting the\r\nstrength of the general system? in the progress of a continued fever we\r\nare repeatedly called upon to fulfil such indications. Dr. Bree[260]\r\nalso observes that “in the exhibition of _Diaphoretics_ the addition of\r\na bitter infusion, or tincture, is frequently proper; for the stomach\r\nshould be gently excited and strengthened during the use of a\r\ndiaphoretic draught.” On the other hand, _Tonics_ not unfrequently\r\nrequire the aid of a diaphoretic; for instance, in the cure of _Cynanche\r\nmaligna_, the use of bark is indicated; but if the skin be hot and dry,\r\nit should be accompanied with a diaphoretic. _See Form. 126_.\r\n\r\nANTISPASMODICS _with_ TONICS, _or_ NARCOTICS. Under the history of\r\nAntispasmodics, (_page 78_) it is stated that there are certain bodies\r\nwhich seem to exert an absolute control over inordinate muscular action,\r\nfrom whatever general cause it may have arisen; in administering such\r\nremedies, however, the intelligent practitioner will not overlook the\r\npeculiar condition of the system in its relations to the disease; where\r\ndebility is present, the _Antispasmodic_ will be usefully combined with\r\na _Tonic_; and, in certain morbid states of the nervous system, with a\r\n_Narcotic_.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS _with_ DIAPHORETICS. Dr. Fordyce has observed, that\r\ncombinations of this kind are often indicated in cases of Diarrhœa,\r\nwhere it is necessary to astringe the vessels of the intestines, and at\r\nthe same time to relax those of the skin; such an indication, he says,\r\nmay be fulfilled by exhibiting _Tormentil root_, or any other vegetable\r\nastringent, with _Ipecacuan_.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS _with_ NARCOTICS, and ABSORBENTS. It has been already\r\nobserved, that in a Diarrhœa, depending upon the influx of acrid fluids\r\ninto the intestines, there are three modes of treatment by which the\r\nmalady may be obviated, viz. by a narcotic, _diminishing the\r\nirritability of the intestines_; by an astringent, _restraining the\r\nserous excretion_; and by an absorbent, _neutralizing the acrid matter_.\r\nAs the modes of action are not incompatible with each other, they maybe\r\nsimultaneously established with the greatest advantage. _See Form. 52_.\r\n\r\nASTRINGENTS _with_ TONICS. A combination of certain medicines belonging\r\nto these two classes is frequently indicated; in the treatment of\r\npassive hemorrhage, we have to astringe the bleeding vessels, and, at\r\nthe same time, to cure the hemorrhagic diathesis by remedies which are\r\ncapable of restoring the general tone of the system. In the treatment of\r\nthe chronic and humid coughs of old persons, I have very frequently\r\nwitnessed the beneficial union of the warm and stimulating influence of\r\n_Myrrh_ with the astringent effects of _Sulphate of Zinc_. _Form. 69_\r\npresents the combination which I have usually adopted with success on\r\nsuch occasions.\r\n\r\nDIURETICS _with_ TONICS. As Dropsy is frequently associated with great\r\ndebility, the practitioner should combine his diuretics with some tonic\r\nmedicine; but in forming a judgment upon the case he must be guided by\r\nthose precepts which have been laid down under the consideration of\r\nDiuretics at page 97. See _Form. 114_.\r\n\r\nDIURETICS _with_ AROMATIC STIMULANTS. Such a combination will be found\r\nadvantageous in those cases where the powers of the system require to be\r\nexcited by more prompt measures than those afforded by the agency of\r\ntonics. _Ethereal_ preparations, with Squill and other stimulating\r\ndiuretics, are well calculated upon such occasions to afford valuable\r\nassistance. _Form. 101–116._\r\n\r\nTONICS _with_ DIFFUSIBLE STIMULANTS. In the cure of dyspepsia, we\r\nfrequently require a remedy, for the purpose of obviating debility, that\r\nis more sudden in its action, and prompt in its effects, than that of a\r\nbitter _tonic_, whose operation is almost imperceptible; while the case\r\nmay at the same time stand in need of that permanent increase of tone,\r\nwhich the latter remedy can alone supply; such an indication therefore\r\nmust be fulfilled by combination. _Form. 40, 42._\r\n\r\nTONICS _with_ PURGATIVES. In the exhibition of tonic medicines it is\r\nfrequently essential to accompany their operation with purgation; in\r\nintermittent fevers, for instance, when attended with a redundant\r\nsecretion of bile, or any obstruction of the viscera, the _bark_ must be\r\ngiven in combination with some laxative, for which purpose Boerhaave has\r\nrecommended _Muriate of Ammonia_; _Mead_, _Rhubarb_; whilst in many\r\ncases, experience suggests the propriety of selecting some of the warmer\r\ncathartics, especially the Alöetic: and I shall take this opportunity to\r\nobserve, that notwithstanding the opinion so strongly expressed by\r\nSydenham, that “_to add any thing to the bark argues either ignorance or\r\ncraft_,” the most respectable testimony may be adduced to demonstrate\r\nthe great advantages which have arisen from the various combinations of\r\nthis heroic remedy. Sir George Baker has said that “_there is less of\r\nreason than of severity_,” in the above remark of Sydenham; for that it\r\nwas found in the cure of the intermittent fever, which he describes,\r\nthat, according to circumstances, sometimes the _Virginian snake root_,\r\nand in other cases _Myrrh_, were added with propriety and advantage;\r\nand, according to the experience of several practitioners, a drachm of\r\nthe _rust of iron_, and the same quantity of the powder of _black\r\npepper_, added to each ounce of _bark_, were the means of subduing the\r\nmost inveterate agues. _Formula 44_ presents a combination, which we\r\nlearn from Dr. Petrie’s letter to Sir George Baker, constitutes a\r\ncelebrated Dutch remedy for an ague, and which was tried with success in\r\nthe hospital at Lincoln, in those obstinate intermittents which\r\nprevailed in the year 1781. Hillary speaks of an epidemic intermittent\r\nat Barbadoes, in which the bark was of no avail, unless combined with\r\nsaline remedies, or some of the tonic bitters. Dr. Barton has stated\r\nthat Bark combined with Mercury in a small proportion, is one of the\r\nbest remedies for removing the swelling of the spleen after an\r\nintermittent.\r\n\r\nEXPECTORANTS _with_ DIFFUSIBLE STIMULANTS. We have seen that\r\nexpectorants may be usefully associated with tonics; it sometimes occurs\r\nthat these remedies require the addition of some diffusible stimulant.\r\nIn certain states of _Peripneumonia notha_, where the powers of life are\r\nebbing, and the lungs become inundated with viscid mucus, I have\r\nexperienced the value of a combination of some stimulating expectorant\r\nand _ammonia_.\r\n\r\nANTACIDS _with_ TONICS. In the cure of cardialgia we have obviously two\r\nindications; to neutralize the offending acid by some chemical agent,\r\nand to correct the morbid state of the digestive functions by some\r\nappropriate remedy. _See Form. 152_. The same observation will apply in\r\nthe treatment of certain cases of chlorosis, where cardialgia is not\r\nunfrequently a very vexatious attendant, and solicits the union of\r\nemmenagogues with antacids, or absorbents, as in _Form. 99_.\r\n\r\nLITHONTHRYPTICS _with_ NARCOTICS. As a palliative in calculous\r\nirritation, the union of alkalies and opium proves a valuable resource.\r\nHenbane may likewise be advantageously combined with a Lithonthryptic;\r\nfor, be it remembered, that few narcotics are more efficacious in\r\nallaying nephritic irritation. (_Form. 156._) We have also frequently\r\ntwo important indications to fulfil in the treatment of urinary\r\nconcretions; where the lithic acid diathesis prevails, it will be\r\nnecessary to neutralize any acidity in the first passages, and at the\r\nsame time to regulate the functions of the skin; we have moreover to\r\ngive tone to the digestive organs; so that, in such cases, the art of\r\nmedicinal combination is well calculated to extend our resources.\r\n\r\nIn the formation of these compounds we should rarely attempt to fulfil\r\nmore than two indications, although cases may occur in which it will be\r\neligible to assail the disease with an engine of _triple_ powers, as\r\nexemplified by _Form. 52_ .\r\n\r\nIn constructing, however, such complex arrangements the practitioner\r\nmust of course take care that he does not fall into the error of\r\nCONTRAINDICATION, and combine substances which possess properties\r\nessentially different, and which are at variance with, or directly\r\nopposed to each other; it is an error of the most serious description,\r\nand unfortunately is one of too common occurrence in the lower walks of\r\nmedical practice; “_crimine ab uno disce omnes_.” I lately met with a\r\ncountry practitioner who, upon being asked by a lady whom he attended,\r\nthe intention of three different draughts which he had sent her,\r\nreplied, that one would warm, the second cool her, and that the third\r\nwas calculated to moderate the too violent effects of either; thus it is\r\nthat discredit and contempt fall upon the use of medicines, which ought\r\nonly to attach to the ignorant pretenders, or designing knaves who\r\nadminister them.\r\n\r\nHaving, in the commencement of this inquiry, stated that all the\r\nprinciples of combination, capable of practical application in the\r\nconstruction of extemporaneous formulæ, are exemplified in the\r\ncomposition of the various productions of Nature, I shall conclude the\r\npresent section by shewing, that _many of our most valuable vegetables\r\nowe their useful properties to the joint operation of the several\r\ndistinct and different ingredients which enter into their composition_.\r\nHow many substances does Nature produce in the vegetable kingdom, in\r\nwhich the permanent tonic quality of bitterness exerts its influence in\r\nunion with the transient stimulating powers of an aromatic principle?\r\nindeed there is a series of vegetable remedies of this kind: commencing\r\nwith those that are simply bitter, we gradually proceed through the\r\ndifferent species, each blending as we advance an increasing proportion\r\nof aroma, until we arrive at those in which the aromatic quality greatly\r\npreponderates. _Peruvian Bark_ may be said to combine within itself the\r\nproperties of _bitterness_, _astringency_, and _aroma_; a fact which\r\nsuggested the probability of our being able to produce an artificial\r\ncompound that might emulate the effects of Cinchona, and to a certain\r\nextent the idea appears to have been realised; for we are told by Dr.\r\nCullen, that he frequently succeeded in the cure of an intermittent by a\r\ncombination of _Oak Bark_ and _Gentian_, when neither bitters nor\r\nastringents, separately, produced the least impression; and I am\r\ninformed by Dr. Harrison, that in the Horncastle Dispensary, of which he\r\nwas for many years physician, he never employed any other remedy for\r\ncuring the ague of Lincolnshire than equal parts of _Bistorta_\r\n(astringent) and _Calamus Aromaticus_ (bitter and aromatic), neither of\r\nwhich plants, _individually_, ever produced the least benefit in such\r\ndiseases. Berzelius attempted to produce a compound of this description\r\nby adding to the bark of the _Ash_ some _Tormentil root_ and _Ginger_;\r\nand he observes that it acted as an excellent tonic, and that according\r\nto the experiments of his friends it seemed to cure quartan agues.[261]\r\nIn the aromatic barks and woods, such as those of the _Canella_,\r\n_Orange-peel_, _Sassafras_, &c. the aromatic principle[262] is combined\r\nwith a bitter ingredient; a union which proves of singular service in\r\nthe formidable bowel complaints so common in tropical climates.\r\n\r\nThe great superiority of the hop, as an ingredient in our malt liquors,\r\ndepends upon the fact of its containing within itself several distinct\r\nand independent elements of activity, which the other bitter herbs that\r\nhave at different times been employed as its substitute, do not possess.\r\nThe philosophy of its operation may be adduced as a striking\r\nillustration of the present subject; first, then, it contains a _bitter_\r\nprinciple, which imparts to the beverage a tonic quality and an\r\nagreeable flavour; while at the same time an _aromatic_ ingredient adds\r\na warm and stimulant property and modifies the bitterness; the hop,\r\nmoreover, contains an _astringent_ ingredient (_Tannin_ and _Gallic\r\nAcid_), the effects of which are to precipitate the vegetable mucilage,\r\nand thus to remove from the beer the active principle of its\r\nfermentation; every attempt therefore to substitute an ordinary bitter\r\nfor that of the hop must necessarily fail, unless a compound can be so\r\nartfully constructed as to contain in due proportions, the principles of\r\nbitterness, astringency, and aroma. _Quassia_ must therefore necessarily\r\nprove but a sorry substitute; it will impart bitterness enough, but it\r\nwill not be modified by agreeable aroma; and as it contains no\r\nastringent principle, it will fail in precipitating the vegetable\r\nmucilage, or gluten; in consequence of which the beer so manufactured\r\nwill be in a perpetual state of fermentation until it is entirely\r\nspoilt.[263] _Rhubarb_ is another medical plant which may be brought\r\nforward in elucidation of the analogies subsisting between natural and\r\nartificial combinations; in this case Nature has presented us with a\r\nsingular and most important union of medicinal powers,—that of an\r\nastringent, with a cathartic property! virtues, which we might, without\r\nthe light of experience, have pronounced to be incompatible with each\r\nother; and yet we find that in this instance the property of astringency\r\nnever interferes with, or opposes the purgative force, since the former\r\ndoes not display itself unless the substance be administered in small\r\ndoses; or, when given in larger ones, not until it has ceased to operate\r\nas a cathartic.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\nTO OBTAIN A NEW AND ACTIVE REMEDY NOT AFFORDED BY ANY SINGLE SUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _By combining medicines which excite different actions in the Stomach\r\nand System, in consequence of which_ NEW, _or modified results, are\r\nproduced._\r\n\r\nThis constitutes by far the most obscure part of the subject of\r\nmedicinal combination, and must ever continue so until we become better\r\nacquainted with the laws which govern the action of medicinal substances\r\nupon the living system. That the most valuable effects, however, are\r\nreally produced by such arrangements, we have the testimony of long\r\nexperience, and examples are furnished in the valuable and well-known\r\noperation of many officinal preparations; thus the “_Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ\r\ncompositus_” contains as its active elements, _Opium_ and _Ipecacuanha_;\r\nand yet, in well regulated doses, it neither possesses the narcotic\r\noperation of the former, nor the nauseating effects of the latter; they\r\nappear to be mutually lost, and converted into a powerful diaphoretic:\r\nso again, the emetic operation of _Sulphuret of Antimony_, and the\r\nspecific influence of _Calomel_, are changed by combination with each\r\nother, giving rise to a remedy eminently distinguished for its powers as\r\nan alterative. Dr. Bree observes that _Tincture of Squills_ combined\r\nwith _Extract of Henbane_, and the _Nitric Acid_, have been proved by\r\nmuch experience to be expectorant and sedative in a paroxysm of asthma,\r\nalthough each article, uncombined, had been given without success. See\r\n_Form. 139_. The efficacy of _Hemlock_, in quieting Pulmonary\r\nirritation, has been frequently adverted to in the course of this work;\r\nI have to state, in this place, that its value, on such occasions, is\r\ngenerally enhanced by combination with _Ipecacuanha_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that many of our natural remedies owe their efficacy to\r\nthe results of a similar species of combination. In the fourth edition\r\nof this work it was stated that, according to the assertion of Dr.\r\nChapman, “_Kino_, when administered in union with _Calumba_, constituted\r\na pretty certain, and powerful purgative;” since the publication of this\r\nfact, I have investigated what, if true, would appear to be a most\r\nextraordinary anomaly in the philosophy of medicinal combination, and I\r\nfind that the statement of Dr. Chapman[264] is not borne out by\r\nexperiment. That we might arrive at a just conclusion upon this subject,\r\nI requested the assistance of my friend Dr. John Davy, whose character\r\nfor experimental accuracy, and whose situation as Superintendant of the\r\nMedical Division of the General Military Hospital at Chatham, seemed to\r\npoint him out as a person peculiarly adapted for such an inquiry; the\r\nresult of his trials does not establish that of the experiments of Dr.\r\nChapman, but on the contrary it seems to prove, that neither _Kino_ nor\r\n_Calumba_, when taken separately, has a constipating effect, and that in\r\nthe form of powder (especially the _Calumba_) each has an aperient\r\nquality, which is not increased by exhibiting the two medicines together\r\nin a state of mixture. The trials from which these inferences are drawn\r\nwere made on different individuals in tolerable health, and they were\r\nrepeated more than once; in some cases they were given separately, and\r\nin others, mixed together, in doses varying from a scruple to a drachm\r\nof each.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _By combining Substances which have the property of acting chemically\r\nupon each other; the result of which is the formation of_ NEW COMPOUNDS,\r\n_or the decomposition of the original Ingredients, and the developement\r\nof their more_ ACTIVE ELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _The Formation of New Compounds._\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to extend our researches beyond the range of the\r\nPharmacopœiæ,[265] to collect a variety of interesting and important\r\nexamples, in illustration of this division of our subject; if we require\r\na striking example of the agency of chemical combination in destroying\r\nthe identity of the original constituents, and of giving origin to a\r\ncompound of new powers, it may be exemplified by the well known instance\r\nof _Sulphate of Potass_, a substance possessing but a weak affinity for\r\nwater, and exerting but little energy upon the animal œconomy; whereas\r\nthe two ingredients of which it consists are distinguished for the\r\nextreme eagerness with which they unite with water, and for the caustic\r\nactivity which they display in their action upon animal matter.\r\n\r\nUnder this head the class of metals will also present itself to our\r\nconsideration, all the individuals of which, with the exception perhaps\r\nof iron, are perfectly inert and harmless; even arsenic, lead, copper,\r\nand mercury, which in certain states of combination constitute some of\r\nthe most virulent of known substances, exert no action upon the living\r\nsystem, unless they be in union with some other body; but when so\r\nunited, how valuable do they become, and what various medicinal effects\r\nmay they not be made to produce.\r\n\r\nThe _Acetic Acid_ and _Ammonia_ become neutralized by combination with\r\neach other, affording a compound of new virtues. _Sulphate of Zinc_, and\r\n_Acetate of Lead_, when mixed together in solution, decompose each\r\nother, and the _Acetate of Zinc_ which is formed, affords a more\r\nvaluable remedy than either of the former salts, as an application in\r\nophthalmia. The “_Mistura Ferri Composita_” of our Pharmacopœia offers\r\nanother example of the same chemical resource. I also beg the reader to\r\nrefer to the construction of _Formula 82_, which presents an instance of\r\na purgative draught being produced by combination, in which the original\r\nproperties of every element are entirely changed. See also _Formula 87_,\r\nthe chemical actions of which are more complicated, but no less\r\ninstructive than the preceding one; the ingredients of the formula are\r\nthe _Carbonates of Soda_ and _Magnesia_,—_Sulphate of Iron_,—_Diluted\r\nSulphuric Acid_, and _Water_—and when mixed together, the following\r\ndecompositions would appear to take place; the free _Sulphuric Acid_,\r\ntogether with that which exists in the _Sulphate of Iron_, being just\r\nsufficient to decompose the _Carbonates of Soda_ and _Magnesia_, forms\r\ntwo neutral _Sulphates_ (viz. _Sulphates of Soda_ and _Magnesia_,) and\r\nthereby disengages a volume of _Carbonic Acid gas_, which not only\r\nincreases the purgative operation of the new saline compounds, but, by\r\nits excess, holds in solution the _Carbonate of Iron_, which is formed\r\nby the decomposition of the _Sulphate_, and which in that state displays\r\nan effect powerfully tonic.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the consideration of medicinal compounds as the results\r\nof chemical action, it is expedient to remind the practitioner of the\r\nessential difference between _Mixture_ and _Combination_, a difference\r\nwhich affects the medicinal virtues no less than the chemical characters\r\nof bodies; it is determined by ample experience, that substances will\r\nproduce effects upon the living system when presented in a state of\r\nsimple mechanical mixture, very different from those which the same\r\nmedicines will occasion when they are combined by the agency of chemical\r\naffinity, as is well exemplified in the comparative effects of alcohol\r\nas existing in ardent spirits, and in wine (see _Vinum_); or in the\r\nrelative powers of _Mercury_ in the _Unguentum Hydrargyri_ of the London\r\nCollege, and the _Unguentum Oxidi Hydrargyri cinerei_ of the\r\nPharmacopœia of Edinburgh, (see _Unguent. Hydrargyri_); the former of\r\nwhich is a true chemical compound, whereas the latter is a simple\r\nmixture of its ingredients.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _The Developement of Active Elements._\r\n\r\nThe accomplishment of such an effect is in many instances the sole\r\nobject of a pharmaceutical process. It is thus that we obtain pure\r\n_Citric acid_ from the juice of the Lemon; _Tartaric acid_, from Cream\r\nof Tartar; _Benzoic acid_, from the resinous substance known by the name\r\nof _Gum Benzoin_; upon the same principle, the _Muriatic_ and _Nitric_\r\nacids are elicited from the saline compounds in which they exist.\r\n_Ammonia_, in its pungent form, is developed from its inodorous\r\n_Muriate_; and the fixed alkalies are obtained in their caustic state,\r\nfrom the comparatively mild _carbonates_ in which they naturally exist.\r\nBut a more striking and instructive instance of the effect of chemical\r\naction, in developing an active, or useful principle, cannot perhaps be\r\nselected than that of the well known stimulant Plaister, composed of\r\n_Muriate of Ammonia_, _Soap_, and _Lead Plaister_, in which the alkali\r\nof soap enters into combination with the muriatic acid, when the\r\n_Ammonia_, upon which the virtues of the plaister solely depend, is\r\nslowly disengaged in the form of gas, producing a powerfully rubifacient\r\nand stimulant effect: the “_Cataplasma Fermenti_,” or “_Yeast\r\nPoultice_,” is indebted for its antiseptic properties to a similar\r\nagency, for they do not depend upon any virtue in the ingredients\r\nthemselves, but upon their decomposition, and the consequent\r\ndevelopement of an active element, which is _Carbonic Acid_. The\r\npractitioner unacquainted with the _modus operandi_ of these\r\ncombinations, would inevitably fall into an error by which their\r\nefficacy must be lost; he would hardly apply them as soon as they were\r\nformed, nor would he be aware of the necessity of repeating them at\r\nshort intervals.\r\n\r\nThe decomposition of _Calomel_ by lime water, forming the well known\r\n“_black wash_” and that of _corrosive sublimate_ in the same fluid,\r\nconstituting the “_aqua phagadenica_,” furnish remedies which derive all\r\ntheir peculiar efficacy from the developement of the mercury in\r\ndifferent states of oxidation. The reader will find another, and a very\r\nstriking illustration of the same principle in the history of\r\n“_Alterative Drops_,” under the article “_Hydrargyri Oxy-murias_.”\r\n\r\nA substance separated by chemical precipitation is often a valuable\r\nremedy, being in a much more subtle and impalpable form than any body\r\ncan be rendered by mechanical triture and levigation;[266] for example,\r\nthe _Carbonate of Lead_, (Cerussa), when diffused in water, is according\r\nto the experience of our best surgeons, far less active as a topical\r\napplication than the same substance when produced at once by\r\nprecipitation from the _Sub-acetate_ of that metal. In some cases, also,\r\nthe substance obtained by precipitation is in a different state of\r\noxidation from that which is prepared by a different process, see _Mist.\r\nFerri Comp:_ It is a question well worthy of consideration whether a\r\nmore active preparation of the _Antimonial powder_ might not be formed\r\nby obtaining the oxide by the precipitation of _Tartarized Antimony_.\r\n\r\nMany interesting and important illustrations have been lately afforded\r\nby an extended knowledge of vegetable chemistry, recent analyses having\r\ndeveloped principles of extreme activity from several of our most\r\nesteemed plants; thus have Sertuerner and Robiquet succeeded in\r\nseparating a narcotic element from _Opium_ (_Morphia_); Majendie, and\r\n_Pelletier_, an emetic principle from _Ipecacuan_, (_Emeta_); and the\r\nlast mentioned chemist, together with Caventou, a tonic one from\r\n_Peruvian Bark_, (_Cinchonia_), the properties and applications of which\r\nwill be fully explained hereafter, under the history of the different\r\nsubstances which contain them.\r\n\r\nIt is only here necessary to caution the practitioner against those\r\nfallacies into which the captivating theories of the chemist may seduce\r\nhim; and, if the views which I have offered upon the subject of\r\ncombination be correct, it will follow as a corollary, that the\r\nconcentration _of an active element must in many cases abridge its\r\npowers as a remedy_; for although the matter thus removed may\r\n_individually_ be quite inert, yet, in combination, it may subdivide the\r\nparticles of the essential constituent, or modify its solubility, and\r\ngive impulse and steadiness to its operation; thus the vegetable alkali\r\n_Quina_, although it indisputably constitutes the active matter of bark,\r\nwill be found inefficacious when separated from it, unless it be\r\nrendered soluble by the addition of sulphuric, or some other acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _By combining substances, between which no other chemical change is\r\ninduced, than a diminution, or an increase, in the_ SOLUBILITIES _of the\r\nprinciples, which are the repositories of their medicinal virtues_.\r\n\r\nThe degree of solubility possessed by a medicinal substance may perhaps\r\nbe regarded by some practitioners as a circumstance of but little or no\r\nimportance; it will however appear in many cases that _it not only\r\ninfluences the activity of a remedy, but, like its dose, goes far to\r\ndetermine its specific operation_; indeed, where a medicine is not, in\r\nitself, very soluble, the increase of its solubility by any chemical\r\nexpedient, is tantamount to an increase of its dose.\r\n\r\nIt is probably owing to the diversity which exists in the solubility of\r\nthe active elements of certain purgatives, that so great a diversity\r\noccurs in their operation; it is, for instance, easy to conceive that a\r\nmedicine may act more immediately and specially on the stomach, small,\r\nor large intestines, according to the relative facility with which its\r\nprinciples of activity enter into solution; that those which are\r\ndissolved before they pass the pylorus are quick and violent in their\r\neffects, and liable to affect the stomach, as is exemplified by the\r\naction of _Gamboge_, &c. whilst some resinous purgatives, on the other\r\nhand, as they contain principles less soluble, seldom act until they\r\nhave passed out of the stomach, and often not until they have reached\r\nthe colon. _Colocynth_ has a wider range of operation, since its\r\nprinciples of activity reside both in soluble and in insoluble elements.\r\n_Aloes_ again, being still further insoluble, pass through the whole\r\nalimentary canal before they are sufficiently dissolved, and act\r\ntherefore more particularly upon the rectum, by which they are liable to\r\nproduce piles, tenesmus, and the various effects which so usually attend\r\ntheir operation. The characteristic effects of _Rhubarb_, _Senna_,\r\n_Saline Cathartics_, and indeed of all individual substances which\r\ncompose the class of the purgative medicines, will also admit of a\r\nsatisfactory explanation from the application of these views. It ought\r\nmoreover to enable the practitioner, by changing the solubilities of\r\nthese substances, to change their medicinal effects. Experience shews\r\nthat this is the fact, and that it may be effected either _by the\r\nintervention of substances that act_ CHEMICALLY; or, _by the addition of\r\nIngredients whose operation is entirely_ MECHANICAL; thus by combining\r\n_Aloes_ with _Soap_ or an _Alkaline Salt_, we quicken their operation,\r\nand remove their tendency to irritate the rectum; the _Compound\r\nDecoction of Aloes_ affords a combination of this kind. _Gamboge_, whose\r\ntoo ready solubility it is an object to obviate, should be intimately\r\nincorporated with some insoluble purgative, as for instance _Aloes_; a\r\nformula of this nature was introduced by Dr. George Fordyce, and it has\r\nbeen since simplified and admitted into our Pharmacopœia, under the\r\ntitle of “_Pilulæ Cambogiæ Compositæ_.” _Tartrate of Potash_, which, on\r\naccount of its comparative solubility, has gained the name of _Soluble\r\nTartar_, acts with corresponding briskness upon the small intestines;\r\nbut by increasing its proportion of _Tartaric Acid_, we convert it into\r\na _super-tartrate_ or “_Cream of Tartar_,” which is a substance\r\ncharacterized by a comparative degree of insolubility, and a\r\ncorrespondent change is produced in the medicinal activity of the salt;\r\nits purgative effects are considerably diminished, whilst its diuretic\r\npowers are rendered more considerable. We may even extend this\r\nexperiment by adding to the _Cream of Tartar_, _Boracic Acid_, a\r\nsubstance capable of increasing to a certain extent its solubility, when\r\nwe shall again find that its purgative properties are strengthened in an\r\nequal proportion.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that a mixture of different saline cathartics is\r\nmore efficient than an equivalent dose of any single one, a fact which\r\nis strikingly exemplified in the prompt and active operation of\r\nCheltenham Salts, in comparatively small doses, as well as in that of\r\nsea water. I submit whether this may not in some degree depend upon\r\nincreased solubility; for it is a law well known to the chemist, that\r\n_when water has ceased to act upon a salt_, _in consequence of its\r\nhaving obtained the term of saturation, the solution may still take up\r\nanother salt of a different kind_. I apprehend that an advantageous\r\napplication of this law might be frequently made in practice, and the\r\nenergies of a remedy thereby considerably extended.[267]\r\n\r\nWhere the active principle of a cathartic is not sufficiently soluble,\r\nit is apt to vex and irritate the bowels, producing tormina instead of\r\nexciting a free and copious excretion; hence the reason why the\r\noperation of resinous purgatives is so commonly attended with griping,\r\nand why relief may be obtained by combining them with _neutral salts_.\r\nThus also _Senna_, whose virtues reside in extractive matter, is apt by\r\ndecoction, or long exposure to the air, to act with griping, in\r\nconsequence of the extractive matter becoming by oxidation, resinous and\r\ncomparatively insoluble: this effect is best counteracted by the\r\naddition of _soluble Tartar_, that will quicken its action, or by an\r\nalkaline salt that will increase its solubility.\r\n\r\nIt appears then to be established as a pharmaceutical maxim, that _the\r\nintensity and even specific action of a purgative medicine may be\r\nmodified or completely changed_, _by changing the degree of solubility\r\npossessed by the principles in which its activity resides_.\r\n\r\nThe application of this principle is highly important in practice,\r\ndirecting us in the choice of the different purgatives, according to the\r\nobjects which we may wish to fulfil by them, and pointing out safe and\r\neasy methods by which we may increase, diminish, retard, or accelerate\r\ntheir operation; it thus enables us to construct new and powerful\r\ncombinations, by imparting to established remedies fresh activity, or by\r\nmitigating the acrimony and violence of arrangements in other respects\r\nefficacious and eligible.\r\n\r\nIn the exhibition of solid substances, their mechanical state of\r\ndivision may be capable of modifying their operation, from the influence\r\nwhich this condition must necessarily exert upon their solubilities,\r\nalthough I am by no means disposed to assign to it the importance which\r\nGaubius has ventured to express, “_Sunt quæ ruditer pulverata alvum,\r\nsubtilius vero urinas, aut alios humores movent_;” and Ray, speaking of\r\nthe _Asarum_ (Hist. p. 208) has the following remark—“_Quo tenuius est\r\ntritum, eo magis urinas movere, minus autem alvum ducere creditur_;” and\r\nLinnæus[268] observes that this same plant, when exhibited in the state\r\nof _very fine_ powder, uniformly acts as an emetic, but that when\r\n_coarsely_ powdered it always passes the stomach, and becomes cathartic.\r\nM. Virey has made a similar observation with respect to\r\nHellebore,—“_L’Hellebore pulverisé fait vomiter; concassé il purge; et\r\nen decoction prolongée, il en devient sudorifique ou diuretique._” I\r\nhave endeavoured under the article _Pulveres_ to establish some useful\r\nprecepts upon this subject, to which I beg to refer the reader.\r\n\r\nThe influence of solubility upon the medicinal energies and specific\r\neffects of remedies, may be farther illustrated by a comparative\r\nexamination of the virtues of the _Acetate_ and _Sub-acetate_ (Goulard’s\r\nExtract) _of Lead:_ the former preserves its solubility and integrity\r\nunder any degree of dilution, while the latter, when slightly diluted\r\nwith the purest water, in consequence of the carbonic acid diffused\r\nthrough it, gives out a copious precipitate; the acetate therefore is\r\nundoubtedly the more immediately active application as a preparation of\r\nlead, but it is nevertheless perhaps less adapted to remove inflammation\r\nand abate irritation than the turbid mixture of the sub-acetate, since\r\nthe slow and gradual action which is ensured by the latter is more\r\ndesirable than the instantaneous operation of the same remedy, applied\r\nin a more soluble form: the popular injection for gonorrhæa, consisting\r\nof a mixed solution of _Sulphate of Zinc_ and _Acetate of Lead_,\r\nprobably owes much of its value to the insoluble precipitate of\r\n_Sulphate_ of lead which necessarily takes place, and which, from\r\nbecoming entangled in the mucus of the urethra, produces a more\r\npermanent stimulus than what could have happened from a soluble salt:\r\n(_Form. 62_) thus again the _Sulphuret of Antimony_, and some other\r\npreparations of that metal, of slow solubility, establish a more\r\npermanent influence than _Tartarized Antimony_, and may be preferable to\r\nit in cases where immediate and active evacuations are not required.\r\n\r\nOf remedies composed of vegetable tonics, the useful application of this\r\nprinciple is also apparent. Thus the addition of _alkalies_, or\r\n_lime-water_, to the infusions of _Gentian_, &c. or to the decoctions of\r\n_Bark_, by rendering their extractive and resinous principles more\r\nsoluble, increase their elegance, and exalt their virtues, (_Form. 39,\r\n41_,) although this law admits of an important exception to be hereafter\r\nexplained. A knowledge of this principle likewise offers many useful\r\nhints connected with the successful exhibition of active remedies; it\r\npoints out the medicines which require dilution in order to promote\r\ntheir operation, and those whose too speedy and violent effects may be\r\nretarded and checked by an abstinence from all potation. Thus, in the\r\nexhibition of _Diuretics_ likely to become cathartic or diaphoretic, no\r\nliquid should be given for at least an hour after their administration;\r\nthe same caution applies with respect to the _Compound Powder of\r\nIpecacuan_, which has a strong tendency to excite vomiting. When the\r\nremedy has passed out of the stomach, then the ingestion of fluids may,\r\nand ought to be encouraged.\r\n\r\nTo Sir Francis Milman the profession is highly indebted for hints\r\nconcerning the importance of accompanying the exhibition of _Diuretics_\r\nwith plentiful dilution,[269] the arguments he adduces elucidate in a\r\nvery satisfactory manner the view which has been just taken of the\r\nINFLUENCE OF SOLUBILITY.\r\n\r\nThe influence of solubility[270] in increasing the virulence of a\r\npoisonous substance, has already been illustrated very fully (_page\r\n135_,) and it has also been shewn under what circumstance it may be\r\nadmissible. When these active substances are administered as remedies,\r\nin small doses, the precept respecting their solubility is even more\r\nimportant, for in such cases the smallness of the quantity places their\r\noperation more immediately under the control of various incidental\r\nagents; _destroy_ the solubility of a medicine, and you will probably\r\ndivest it of those properties which render it useful. _Nitrate of\r\nSilver_, by coming in contact with a _Muriatic Salt_, is rendered quite\r\ninert, and may be discovered unaltered in the fæces of persons to whom\r\nit has been administered. See _Argenti Nitras_.\r\n\r\nUnder the article _Plumbi Acetas_ the practitioner will also find that\r\nthe conjunction of this substance with any sulphuric salt, at once\r\ndeprives it of its valuable properties as a remedy in _Hæmopthysis_.\r\n\r\nSome practitioners, whose opinions I always receive with respect, have\r\nconsidered these views respecting the influence of solubility as\r\nsavouring too much of the refinement of theory, and instances have been\r\nsuggested which would appear to invalidate their pretensions; upon\r\nexamination, however, it will be found that such exceptions are but\r\napparent, and depend upon the solvent action of the gastric fluid. Thus\r\nthe _Protoxide of Iron_ would appear to be soluble in the fluids of the\r\nstomach, and is consequently an active medicine, whereas the _Peroxide_\r\nof the same metal, being insoluble under such circumstances, requires to\r\nbe combined with an acid, as in the _Tinctura Ferri Muriatis_, to render\r\nit efficacious. The same remark will probably apply to the oxides of\r\nantimony.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this section upon the influence of Solubility, by the\r\nrelation of an anecdote which may tend to confirm the justness of the\r\nviews I have offered, more satisfactorily perhaps than any additional\r\narguments derived from a scientific examination of chemical and\r\nmedicinal facts; in as much as it presents us with a practice, the\r\nutility of which has been discovered by unassisted experience, and must\r\nconsequently be independent of theory. The American Indians, whenever\r\nthey undertake a long journey, and are likely to be destitute of\r\nprovisions, employ Tobacco for the purpose of counteracting the uneasy\r\nsensations of hunger, and in its preparation for such a purpose they\r\nadopt an expedient for modifying its powers, and protracting its\r\neffects, which affords an instructive illustration of the influence of\r\nsolubility; it consists in combining the juice of Tobacco, with the\r\npulverized shells of snails, cockles, and oysters;[271] the mass is\r\ndried, and formed into pills, of a convenient size to be held between\r\nthe gum and lip, which being gradually dissolved and swallowed, fulfil\r\nthe intention required.[272]\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\nTO AFFORD AN ELIGIBLE FORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. _By which the efficacy of the remedy is enhanced._\r\n\r\nAfter the views which have been submitted in the progress of the present\r\ninquiry, it is evident, that the _form_ in which a remedy is\r\nadministered may exert some influence upon its medicinal effects; for\r\nadditional proofs of this fact, and for more particular directions, see\r\n_Decocta_, _Infusa_, _Tincturæ_, _Misturæ_, _Pilulæ_, _Pulveres_, &c.\r\n\r\nWhen a substance, or a combination of substances, requires the addition\r\nof some other one, for the purpose of imparting a convenient, agreeable,\r\nor efficacious form, _a vehicle should always be selected, whose effects\r\nwill be likely to correspond with the intention of the other\r\ningredients_. This precept may be exemplified by a reference to _Form.\r\n80, 134_, and others, the _key-letters_ of which announce the _modus\r\noperandi_ of their respective _vehicles_.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. _By which its aspect or flavour is rendered more agreeable._\r\n\r\nIt should ever be the object of the practitioner to accommodate, as far\r\nas he is able, the form and flavour of his medicines to the taste and\r\ncaprice of his patient, provided always that he does not compromise\r\ntheir efficacy, and which often appears to be nearly connected with\r\nthose sensible qualities which render them disgusting and objectionable.\r\n\r\nSome medicines are more grateful to the stomach, as well as more\r\nefficacious in their operation, when exhibited in the state of\r\neffervescence. To effect this we have only to introduce an alkaline\r\ncarbonate into the formula, and to direct a portion of some vegetable\r\nacid to be added just before it is swallowed. We must, however, take\r\ncare that the ingredients are of a nature not likely to be decomposed by\r\nthe alkali, in the first instance, or by the neutral salt, which is\r\nformed, in the second. See _Form. 27, 82, 86_.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. _By which it is_ PRESERVED _from the spontaneous decomposition to\r\nwhich it is liable._\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes adviseable to add an ingredient for the purpose of\r\npreventing the sudden decomposition of a medicine; thus is the _Compound\r\nTincture of Cardamoms_ added to the _Compound Decoction of Aloes_, in\r\norder that the latter may be preserved a longer period without change.\r\nThe addition of sugar will prevent ointments from becoming rancid.\r\nVegetable infusions, that are susceptible of mouldiness, are best\r\npreserved from such deterioration by some aromatic addition. For the\r\nknowledge of this fact we are indebted to Dr. Mac Culloch, who in a very\r\ninteresting paper, lately published in the Edinburgh Philosophical\r\nJournal[273] has observed, that perfumes, such as _Essential Oils_, &c.\r\nwill prevent the production and growth of those minute cryptogamous\r\nvegetables, upon which the phenomenon of mouldiness depends.[274]\r\n\r\nSuch are the objects which are to be attained by combining several\r\nsubstances in one _Formula_, and such the laws by which these\r\ncompositions are to be regulated; but unless a physician can\r\nsatisfactorily trace the operation of each element in his prescription\r\nto the accomplishment of one or more of the objects which I have\r\nenumerated, SIMPLICITY should be regarded by him as the greatest\r\ndesideratum. I was once told by a practitioner in the country that the\r\nquantity, or rather complexity of the medicines which he gave his\r\npatients, for there never was any deficiency in the former, was always\r\nincreased in a ratio with the obscurity of their cases; “if,” said he,\r\n“I fire a great profusion of shot, it is very extraordinary if some do\r\nnot hit the mark.” Sir Gilbert Blane[275] has given us a similar\r\nanecdote; “a practitioner being asked by his patient why he put so many\r\ningredients into his prescription, is said to have answered more\r\nfacetiously than philosophically, _in order that the disease may take\r\nwhich it likes best_.” A patient in the hands of such a practitioner has\r\nnot a much better chance than the Chinese Mandarin who, upon being\r\nattacked with any disorder, calls in twelve or more physicians, and\r\nswallows in one mixture all the potions which each separately\r\nprescribes!\r\n\r\nLet not the young practitioner however be so deceived; he should\r\nremember that unless he be well acquainted with the mutual actions which\r\nbodies exert upon each other, and upon the living system, it may be laid\r\ndown as an axiom, that _in proportion as he complicates a medicine, he\r\ndoes but multiply the chances of its failure_. SUPERFLUA NUNQUAM NON\r\nNOCENT: let him cherish this maxim in his remembrance, and in forming\r\ncompounds, always discard from them every element which has not its mode\r\nof action clearly defined, and as thoroughly understood.\r\n\r\nThe perfection of a Medicinal Prescription may be defined by three\r\nwords; it should be PRECISE (in its _directions_,) CONCISE (in its\r\n_construction_,) DECISIVE (in its _operation_.) It should carry upon its\r\nvery face an air of energy and decision, and speak intelligibly the\r\nindications which it is to fulfil. It may be laid down as a position\r\nwhich is not in much danger of being controverted, that _where the\r\nintention of a medicinal compound is obscure, its operation will be\r\nimbecile_.\r\n\r\nA Medicinal Formula has been divided into four constituent parts, a\r\ndivision which will be found to admit of useful application to practice,\r\nin as much as it was evidently suggested with a view of accomplishing\r\nthe more prominent objects which have been related in the preceding\r\npages; or, in the language of Asclepiades, of enabling the BASIS to\r\noperate “CITO,” “TUTO,” et “JUCUNDE.” Quickly, Safely, and\r\nPleasantly—thus\r\n\r\n  I. THE BASIS, or Principal Medicine.\r\n\r\n                                 (_curare._)\r\n\r\n  II. THE ADJUVANS; that which assists and promotes its operation.\r\n\r\n                                 (“_Cito._”)\r\n\r\n  III. THE CORRIGENS; that which corrects its operation.\r\n\r\n                                 (“_Tuto._”)\r\n\r\n  IV. THE CONSTITUENS; that which imparts an agreeable form.\r\n\r\n                                (“_Jucunde._”)\r\n\r\nThese elements however are not all necessarily present in every\r\nscientific formula, for many medicines do not require any addition to\r\npromote their operation, and the mild and tractable nature of others\r\nrenders the addition of any corrective unnecessary; whilst many again\r\nare in themselves sufficiently manageable, and do not therefore require\r\nthe _intermede_ of any _vehicle_ or _constituent_. It also frequently\r\noccurs that one element is capable of fulfilling two or more of the\r\nobjects required; the ADJUVANS for instance, may at the same time act as\r\nthe CORRIGENS, or CONSTITUENS; thus the addition of _Soap_ to _Aloes_,\r\nor _Extract of Jalap_, mitigates their acrimony, and at the same time\r\nquickens their operation (80.) So again _Neutral Salts_ both quicken and\r\ncorrect the griping which attends the operation of resinous purgatives.\r\nThe disposition of the key letters placed opposite to the elements of\r\nthe following _Formulæ_, will furnish the practitioner with a farther\r\nelucidation of these principles, viz. 70, 71, 76, 77, 101, 102, 105,\r\n135, &c. This coincidence, if possible, should be always attained, for\r\nit simplifies the formula, and by decreasing the bulk of the remedy,\r\nrenders it less nauseous and more elegant.[276]\r\n\r\nThis division also affords the best general rule for placing the\r\ningredients of a formula in proper order, for the order should\r\ncorrespond with that of the arrangement; and those elements intended to\r\nact in unity should be marshalled together. The chemical and mechanical\r\nnature however of a medicinal substance will occasionally offer\r\nexceptions to any general rule; thus the volatile ingredients should be\r\nthose last added, and the constituent or _vehicle_ should be placed next\r\nthe particular element to which it is intended to impart convenience or\r\nefficacy of form, or a capability of mixing with the other ingredients,\r\nas may be seen in Formulæ 69, 71, 127, 136, &c. This consideration\r\ninduced the Committee, appointed to revise the late Pharmacopœia, to\r\nalter the order of the ingredients in the “_Mistura Ferri composita_,”\r\nand to place the “_Spiritus Myristicæ_” next in succession to the\r\n“_Potassæ Sub-carbonas_” and _Myrrh_. If any substance require decoction\r\nor infusion, a question then arises, determinable only by a knowledge of\r\nits chemical composition, whether the remaining ingredients should be\r\nadded previous to, during, or subsequent to, that operation; _Formula\r\n40_, which is recommended by Pringle as a remedy for Typhus fever, may\r\nserve to exemplify this principle. The preparation of the ingredients is\r\nresolved into three distinct stages, and it is easy to discover that by\r\nany other arrangement their several virtues could not be fully obtained,\r\nand secured from change. The _Cinchona_, for instance, yields its full\r\npowers only by decoction, a process which would necessarily impair those\r\nof _Serpentaria_, connected as they are with an essential oil; whilst\r\nthe addition of the acid at any other stage of the process than that\r\ndirected, would produce decompositions in the vegetable substances; and\r\nit is evident that were the _Spirit of Cinnamon_ added previously, it\r\nwould be entirely lost by vaporization. So in making the _Compound\r\nDecoction of Sarsaparilla_, the _Sassafras_ should be added after the\r\nother ingredients have undergone boiling. The Decoctions of _Lichen\r\nIslandicus_ and _Sarsaparilla_ constitute a popular remedy on the\r\nContinent, in certain forms of Phthisis; now it is evident that as the\r\nformer plant loses its virtues by long coction, and the latter requires\r\na protracted ebullition for the extraction of its virtues, they ought\r\nnot to be included under the same general directions; each decoction\r\nshould be separately performed, and the results subsequently mixed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND MEDICINES have been divided into two Classes, _viz_.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS,\r\n\r\nwhich are those ordered in the Pharmacopœias, and kept ready prepared in\r\nthe shops. No uniform class of medicines however can answer the\r\nindications of every case, and hence the necessity of\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MAGISTRAL OR EXTEMPORANEOUS FORMULÆ.\r\n\r\nThese are constructed by the practitioner at the moment, and may be\r\neither arrangements altogether new, or officinal preparations with\r\nadditions, or modifications. Too much importance cannot be assigned to\r\nthe Art which thus enables the physician to adopt and graduate a\r\npowerful remedy to each particular case by a prompt and accurate\r\nprescription; without this knowledge, the practitioner of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, with all the collateral aid of modern science, will be as\r\nhelpless in the chamber of sickness as the physicians of ancient Egypt,\r\nwho were obliged by the laws to follow with servile exactness the\r\nunvarying mandates of their medical code. _Extemporaneous_ are also\r\npreferable to _Officinal Formulæ_, whenever the powers of the compound\r\nare less liable to deterioration from being long kept; for examples, see\r\n_Mistura Ferri composita_; _Infusum Sennæ_; _Liquor Hydrargyri\r\nOxymuriatis_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL AND PHARMACEUTICAL ERRORS, WHICH MAY BE COMMITTED IN THE\r\nCOMPOSITION OF EXTEMPORANEOUS FORMULÆ, ARE REFERABLE TO THE FOLLOWING\r\nSOURCES.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.—_Substances are added together which are incapable of mixing, or, of\r\nforming Compounds of uniform and suitable consistence._\r\n\r\nThis may be termed an error in the _Mechanism_ of the Prescription, and\r\nhas been generally regarded as being more inconvenient than dangerous,\r\nmore fatal to the credit of the Prescriber than to the case of the\r\nPatient: the observations however which are offered in this work,\r\nespecially under the article _Pilulæ_, must satisfy the practitioner\r\nthat this error is more mischievous in its effects than has been usually\r\nsupposed; it is so palpable and self-evident in its nature, that it will\r\nbe unnecessary to illustrate it by more than one or two examples.\r\n_Calomel_, for instance, has been ordered in an aqueous vehicle, and\r\ncertain _resinous tinctures_ have been directed in draughts, without the\r\nnecessary intervention of mucilage; so again, an intermixture of\r\nsubstances has been formerly ordered in powder that possess the perverse\r\nproperty of becoming liquid by triture (see _Pulveres_), and bodies have\r\nbeen prescribed in the form of pills, whose consistence[277] renders it\r\nimpossible that they should preserve the globular form; or else they\r\nhave been so hard and insoluble, that they might be fired through a deal\r\nboard.[278] In the London Pharmacopœia of 1809, an error of this kind\r\nunfortunately passed without correction with regard to the Formula for\r\npreparing the _Syrup of Senna_.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.—_Substances are added together which mutually decompose each other,\r\nwhence their original virtues are changed, or destroyed._\r\n\r\nThis is a more serious, but not a less frequent source of error; it has\r\nbeen already shewn in this Analysis (IV. B) that the judicious and\r\nscientific application of chemical science has furnished new and endless\r\nresources to the physician, by exalting the efficacy and correcting the\r\nacrimony of established remedies, or by combining inert substances so as\r\nto create new and powerful medicines. With equal truth and confidence it\r\nmay be asserted, that the abuse of these means not only destroys the\r\nvirtues of the most valuable articles in the _Materia Medica_, but that\r\nthe mildest remedy may be thus converted into an instrument of torture,\r\nand even of death. In a lecture delivered at Apothecaries’ Hall, Mr.\r\nBrande stated that he had seen a prescription in which the _blue_, or\r\nmercurial pill, was ordered in conjunction with nitric acid, and that\r\nthe patient was brought to “death’s door” from the formation of _nitrate\r\nof mercury_ in his stomach! I have myself lately seen a _Recipe_,\r\nprofessing to afford a preparation similar to the “_Black Drop_,” and\r\nwhich directed a mixture of a _Tincture of Opium_, made with rectified\r\nspirit, with _Nitric Acid_; in this case, it may be very safely inferred\r\nthat the author was not only ignorant of the chemical habitudes of these\r\nbodies, but that he never performed the experiment in question, or he\r\nwould have learnt from dire experience, that in consequence of the rapid\r\nevolution of _nitric ether_, the contents of the phial will explode with\r\nviolence, to the imminent hazard of the operator’s eye-sight. During the\r\ncourse of my professional practice I have witnessed more than an\r\nordinary share of consumptive cases, and I can confidently state that in\r\nthe treatment of Hæmopthysis, the styptic properties of _Acetate of\r\nlead_ are entirely invalidated by combination with _Alum_,[279] or by\r\nits exhibition being accompanied with that of the acidulated _infusion\r\nof roses_, or with small doses of _sulphate of magnesia_; and yet, I\r\nwould ask, whether this practice is not usual and general? The\r\npractitioner however cannot be too often reminded that he is not to\r\nreject a remedy whose value has been ascertained by experience, merely\r\nbecause it appears to be unchemical: the popular and certainly useful\r\npill, consisting of calomel, rhubarb and soap, may be adduced as an\r\nexample of this kind. Of the _Mistura Ferri Composita_, I will only say\r\nthat it is a most valuable combination; and whether it be the product of\r\naccident, or the result of philosophical induction, it equally deserves\r\na distinguished place in our list of tonic remedies: but it cannot be\r\ndenied that many of our esteemed arrangements, which are in apparent\r\ncontradiction to all the laws of composition, owe their efficacy to the\r\noperation of affinities altogether blind and fortuitous.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that the practice of combining certain vegetable\r\ntonics with lime-water, although very common, is in cases where we are\r\ndesirous to obtain their _astringent_ effects, of very doubtful\r\npropriety; for the fact is, that _Tannin_ forms with the alkalies and\r\nalkaline earths, compounds that are not soluble in water,[280] and which\r\nare therefore probably inefficacious. It may perhaps be said that such\r\nan argument cannot avail, because if the astringent matter be even\r\nintroduced into the stomach in its purest form, it will immediately form\r\nan insoluble compound on its contact with _gelatine_.[281] We know so\r\nlittle of the laws of _gastric chemistry_, that it is difficult to learn\r\nwhat changes take place in the animal laboratory; but it would seem\r\nprobable that the powers of the stomach rather consist in decomposing\r\nthe ingesta into simple forms, than in complicating them by favoring new\r\ncombinations; besides which, if such a compound were formed, it would be\r\nsubsequently decomposed _in transitu_; for the experiments of Sir H.\r\nDavy shew that vegetable astringent matter passes through the body\r\nunchanged. (_page 82._)\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to furnish any general rule that may enable the\r\npractitioner to avoid mixing together substances which are incompatible\r\nwith each other; a knowledge of their chemical habitudes must in every\r\ncase direct him, and these are enumerated in the second part of this\r\nwork, under the history of each medicinal substance. The physician\r\nhowever will find it useful to retain in his remembrance the simple and\r\nbeautiful law which has been so ably developed by the eminent author of\r\nthe “STATIQUE CHIMIQUE,” that _whenever two salts in a state of solution\r\nare brought together, which contain, within themselves, elements capable\r\nof producing a soluble and insoluble salt, a decomposition must\r\nnecessarily arise_;[282] he illustrates this law by the example of\r\n_Nitrate of Silver_ and _Muriate of Potass_, whose elements are capable\r\nof forming within themselves a soluble salt, _Nitrate of Potass_, and an\r\ninsoluble salt, _Muriate of Silver_. It deserves also to be remembered,\r\nthat a table of chemical affinity will not upon all occasions prove to\r\nthe medical practitioner an unerring pilot; in those cases for instance,\r\nwhere a _super or sub Salt is readily formed, a substance less weakly\r\nattracted by another than a third, will sometimes precipitate this third\r\nfrom its combination with the second_, thus in the production of _Nitric\r\nacid_, we decompose the _Nitrate of Potass_ by virtue of the superior\r\naffinity of the _Sulphuric acid_ for its base, the nitric acid is\r\naccordingly disengaged, and a _Sulphate of Potass_ remains in the\r\nretort; now, paradoxical as it may appear, if nitric acid be poured upon\r\nthe _Sulphate of Potass_, a quantity of nitre will be reproduced, in\r\nconsequence of the saturation of a portion of the base, in such a\r\nproportion as to enable the remaining atoms to form a _Bi-Sulphate of\r\nPotass_. In the same manner the _Tartrate of Potass_ (Soluble Tartar)\r\nis, contrary to the usual affinities, decomposed by all sub-acid\r\nvegetables, which neutralize a portion of the base, and convert the salt\r\ninto the _Bi-tartrate of Potass_ (_Cream of Tartar_). The same effect is\r\neven produced by _Carbonic acid_.[283]\r\n\r\nThere are besides certain cases wherein _Triple Salts_ are produced,\r\nwhich afford apparent exceptions to the usual affinities of the bodies\r\ninvolved in the combination; we have a very good illustration of this\r\ntruth in the decomposition of the _Liquor Ammoniæ Acetatis_ by\r\n_Magnesia_; if the practitioner refers to a table of affinities, he will\r\nperceive that _Acetic acid_ has a greater attraction for _Ammonia_ than\r\nfor _Magnesia_; but if upon this assurance he were to administer these\r\nbodies together, he, or his patient, would soon discover that ammonia is\r\ndeveloped with considerable pungency; now in this case the _Magnesia_\r\nforms a _triple Acetate_ with one part of the ammonia, and consequently\r\nsets the remainder at liberty.\r\n\r\nA popular error exists with respect to the subject of chemical\r\nincompatibility, against which it may be here advisable to caution the\r\ninexperienced prescriber, viz. that _no important change is produced, on\r\nthe admixture of solutions, unless precipitation is occasioned_. This\r\nhowever occurs only when the new compound produced is insoluble; thus\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ may be added to _Lime water_, by which a _Sulphate of\r\nLime_ is formed, but as its proportion is not too large for the water to\r\ndissolve, no precipitate occurs; so again, a solution of _Nitrate of\r\nSilver_ is not apparently disturbed by the addition of _Ammonia_,\r\nbecause the resulting _Ammoniuret_ is a soluble compound. We should,\r\nnevertheless, commit a great error in supposing that, for such a reason,\r\nthese bodies were not _incompatible_. On the other hand, the medicinal\r\npowers of a solution are not necessarily destroyed by the occurrence of\r\na precipitate, although such a result should always be regarded with\r\nsuspicion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.—_The Methods directed for the preparation of the Ingredients are\r\neither inadequate to the accomplishment of the object, or they change\r\nand destroy the efficacy of the Substances._\r\n\r\nThe observations already offered upon _Formula 40_, will sufficiently\r\nexplain the nature of the various errors comprehended under this head:\r\nso, again, if the virtues of a plant reside in _essential oils_, which\r\nare easily volatilized, or in _extractive matter_, which readily\r\nbecomes oxidized, DECOCTION must necessarily destroy its efficacy; a\r\nstriking example of this fact is presented us in the history of the\r\n_Laurel_ and _Bitter Almond:_ the poisonous influence of the essential\r\noil and distilled water of these vegetable substances is well known,\r\nbut their watery extracts are perfectly innocuous. A still more\r\nfamiliar example is to be found in the onion, or in garlic, which by\r\nsimple coction is deprived of all its acrimonious qualities. On the\r\nother hand, an error equally injurious would be committed, by\r\ndirecting a simple infusion of a vegetable, whose medicinal properties\r\ndepended upon resino-mucilaginous principles. Orfila found that an\r\nextract of Hemlock, prepared by boiling the dried powder in water and\r\nevaporating the decoction, was entirely destitute of activity. See\r\n_Decocta_, _Infusa_, _Extracta_.\r\n\r\nAn instance of the baneful effects which may arise from an erroneous\r\nmethod of preparation happened some time ago to fall under my immediate\r\nnotice and care; it was in preparing an infusion of the root of the\r\n_Veratrum_ with _Opium_, as directed by Mr. James Moore, when the\r\ndispenser ignorantly substituted a spirituous for a vinous menstruum.\r\n\r\nA very common error may be here noticed, which is that of prescribing a\r\nsubstance in such a form, as not to be acted upon with any effect by the\r\nsolvent; as an example it may be stated, that in preparing an infusion\r\nof _Juniper Berries_, unless pains be taken by strong contusion to break\r\nthe seed, it will contain but little power as a medicine.\r\n\r\nThe unbruised seeds of Mustard were commended by Dr. Mead,[284] in\r\nAscites, and by Bergius, in Intermittents; Dr. Cullen, however, has very\r\nproperly observed that the seeds given in the above manner are never\r\nbroken down or dissolved in the stomach, but pass away entire by stool,\r\nand cannot therefore occasion any beneficial result.\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to multiply examples in proof of the numerous errors\r\ninto which a physician must unavoidably fall, who presumes to compose\r\nprescriptions without a knowledge of the chemical habitudes of the\r\ndifferent substances which he combines. The file of every apothecary\r\nwould furnish a volume of instances, where the ingredients of the\r\nprescription are fighting together in the dark, or at least are so\r\nadverse to each other, as to constitute a most incongruous and chaotic\r\nmass.\r\n\r\n   “Obstabat aliis aliud: quia corpore in uno\r\n   Frigida pugnabant calidis, humentia siccis,\r\n   Mollia cum duris, sine pondere, habentia pondus.”\r\n                                       _Ovid. Metamorph._ lib. 1. 19.\r\n\r\nTHE DOSES OF MEDICINAL SUBSTANCES are specific with respect to each, and\r\ncan therefore be only learnt from experience; the young and eager\r\npractitioner, however, is too often betrayed into the error of supposing\r\nthat the powers of a remedy always increase in an equal ratio with its\r\ndose, whereas THE DOSE ALONE VERY OFTEN DETERMINES ITS SPECIFIC ACTION.\r\n“_Medicines_,” says Linnæus, “_differ from poisons, not in their nature,\r\nbut in their dose_,” which is but a paraphrase of the well known\r\naphorism of Pliny, “_Ubi virus, ibi virtus_.”[285]—So that food,\r\nremedies, and poisons, may be said to branch into each other by\r\nindefinable gradations;—Five grains of _Camphor_ act as a mild sedative\r\nand slight diaphoretic, but twenty grains induce nausea, and act as a\r\nstimulant; so again, _Opium_, in too large doses, instead of promoting,\r\nprevents sleep, and rather stimulates the bowels than acts as a\r\nnarcotic. Two ounces of any neutral salt are apt to be emetic, one ounce\r\neven of _Alum_ to be cathartic, and two drachms to be refrigerant; in\r\nlike manner the preparations of _Antimony_ either vomit, purge, or\r\nsweat, according to the quantity exhibited.\r\n\r\nWould it not appear that _powerful doses rather produce a local than a\r\ngeneral effect_? Experience seems to prove in this respect, that the\r\neffect of an internal application is similar to that of an external\r\nimpression; if violent, it affects the part only to which it is applied,\r\nas pinching does that of the skin, whereas titillation, which may be\r\nsaid to differ only from the former in degree, acts upon the whole\r\nsystem, and occasions itching and laughter, and if long continued,\r\nweakness, sickness, vomiting, and convulsions; in like manner\r\n_Digitalis_, if given in large doses, acts immediately upon the stomach\r\nor bowels, becoming emetic and cathartic, but in smaller proportions it\r\nproduces a GENERAL effect, increasing all the excretions, especially\r\nthat of urine; so, again, large doses of the _Mercurial Pill_ act upon\r\nthe bowels, and are eliminated from the body, whereas the same remedy in\r\nsmall doses affects the system generally, and excites a universal\r\ninfluence. I am well satisfied that the regulation of the dose of a\r\nmedicine is even more important than it is usually supposed to be.\r\n_Substances perfectly inert and useless in one dose may prove in another\r\nactive and valuable._ Hence may be explained the great efficacy of many\r\nmineral waters, whilst the ingredients which impart activity to them are\r\nfound comparatively inert, when they become the elements of an\r\nartificial combination; and hence probably the failure of many\r\n_alterative_ medicines, when no other rational cause can be assigned for\r\nit. We need not seek far for an example of the very different and\r\nopposite effects which the same substance can produce in different\r\ndoses; the operation of _Common Salt_ is familiar to us all; Sir John\r\nPringle has shewn that in quantities such as we usually take with our\r\nfood, its action is highly septic, softening and resolving all meat to\r\nwhich it is applied, whereas in large quantities it usually preserves\r\nsuch substances from putrefaction, and therefore, when so taken, instead\r\nof promoting, destroys digestion.\r\n\r\nIt is moreover probable that medicinal, like nutritive substances, are\r\nmore readily absorbed into the circulating system when presented in\r\nsmall quantities, than when applied in more considerable proportions. It\r\nis upon this principle that a large quantity of food, taken seldom, does\r\nnot fatten so much as smaller quantities at shorter intervals, as is\r\nexemplified in the universal good condition of cooks and their\r\nattendants. It is not pressing the principle of analogy too far to\r\nsuppose that the action of _alteratives_, which require to be absorbed,\r\nmay be more effectually answered by similar management; that is, _by\r\nexhibiting small doses at short intervals_.\r\n\r\nThe operation of medicines is influenced by certain general\r\ncircumstances, which should be also kept in mind when we\r\napportion their dose; e.g. AGE—SEX—TEMPERAMENT—STRENGTH OF THE\r\nPATIENT—HABIT—DIET—PROFESSION—CLIMATE—DURATION OF THE DISEASE—STATE OF\r\nTHE STOMACH—IDIOSYNCRASY—and THE VARIABLE ACTIVITY OF THE MEDICINAL\r\nSUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\nWomen generally require smaller doses than men. Habit, or the protracted\r\nuse of a medicine, generally diminishes its power, although certain\r\ncathartics appear to offer an exception, for when long continued, their\r\nactivity is proportionally increased, as is well known to every person\r\nwho is familiar with the operation of the Cheltenham waters. Dr. Lamb\r\nhas also stated with regard to the operation of Lead, “that the\r\nconstitution, so far from being reconciled to it by habit, is rendered\r\nmore and more sensible to its irritation by continuance.” Emetics also\r\nfrequently become more powerful by repetition; Cullen informs us that he\r\nknew a person so accustomed to excite vomiting in himself that the one\r\ntwentieth part of a grain of tartarized antimony was sufficient to\r\nexcite a convulsive action of the stomach; in some cases such an effect\r\nmay perhaps be referred to the operation of the mind; for after the\r\nfrequent use of an emetic, the mere sight of it, or even conversation\r\nrelative to it, has been found sufficient to excite nausea.\r\n\r\nIn apportioning the dose of a very active medicine, it is of the\r\ngreatest moment to determine the relative degrees of power between the\r\nsystem and the remedy, and to know to what extent the latter is likely\r\nto be carried, consonantly with the powers of life to resist it; thus,\r\nafter a patient has been exhausted by protracted and severe suffering\r\nand watching, a dose, different to one at the commencement of the\r\ndisease is requisite. The importance of this precept is impressed upon\r\nmy mind from having witnessed, in the course of my practice, several\r\ninstances of the mischief which has arisen from a want of attention to\r\nit; that disease materially influences the condition of the body, and\r\nits susceptibility to remedial impressions, has been already\r\ndemonstrated. Emetics act very readily in febrile affections, while in\r\nthose of the Neuroses[286] they produce their effects with difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the application of external remedies to diseased parts, it especially\r\nbehoves the Surgeon to take into consideration the degree of vitality\r\npossessed by such parts, and to graduate their strength accordingly.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry Earle[287] has published a very interesting case in\r\nillustration of this principle. The arm of a person became paralytic, in\r\nconsequence of an injury of the axillary plexus of nerves from a\r\nfracture of the collar bone; upon keeping the limb for nearly half an\r\nhour in a tub of warm grains, ‘_which were previously ascertained by the\r\nother hand not to be too hot_,’ the whole hand became blistered in a\r\nmost alarming manner, and sloughs formed at the extremities of the\r\nfingers, and underneath the nails; a considerable degree of inflammation\r\nsubsequently spread in the course of the absorbents, and matter formed\r\nin the axilla, which was soon absorbed, and the inflammation assuaged.\r\nWhence it follows, that a limb deprived of its usual supply of nervous\r\nenergy cannot sustain, without injury, an elevation of temperature which\r\nwould not be in the least prejudicial to a healthy member. Mr. Earle\r\nsupports this conclusion by the relation of another case, in which the\r\nulnar nerve had been divided, for the cure of a painful affection of the\r\narm; the consequence of which operation was, that the patient was\r\nincapable of washing in water at a temperature that was quite harmless\r\nto every duly vitalized part, without suffering from vesication and\r\nsloughs.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the subject of DOSE, it may be necessary to observe, that\r\nthere are many remedies that do not act with greater violence in a large\r\ndose than in one comparatively small; _Ipecacuan_, for instance, is more\r\ncertain in its operation, but not more violent, when given in a large\r\nquantity; the same may be said of _Aloes_, and several other medicines.\r\n\r\nTHE VARIABLE ACTIVITY OF A MEDICINE should also be appreciated, and\r\nperhaps the practitioner would act cautiously if he were to reduce the\r\ndose, should it be a very considerable one, whenever a fresh parcel of\r\nthe medicine is commenced, especially of the powders of active\r\nvegetables liable to deterioration from being kept, as those of\r\n_Digitalis_, &c.\r\n\r\nTHE TIME OF THE DAY at which remedies should be administered deserves\r\nlikewise some attention. _Evacuating Medicines_ ought to be exhibited\r\nlate at night or early in the morning. It would seem that during sleep\r\nthe bowels are not so irritable, and consequently not so easily acted\r\nupon, which allows time for the full solution of the substance; the same\r\nobservation applies to _Alterative_ and other medicines which are liable\r\nto suffer from a vexatious irritability of the bowels; it is on this\r\naccount eligible to exhibit _Guaiacum_, _Pilulæ Hydrargyri_, &c. when\r\nthey are not intended to purge, at bed time. On the other hand, where\r\nthe effects of a remedy are likely to be lost by perspiration, as is the\r\ncase with _Diuretics_, many of which are by external heat changed into\r\n_Diaphoretics_, it may become a question with the judicious practitioner\r\nwhether he cannot select some more favourable period for their\r\nexhibition.\r\n\r\nIn fevers it is of importance to consult in all respects the quiet and\r\ncomfort of the patient; Dr. Hamilton therefore, in his valuable work on\r\nPurgatives, very judiciously observes that, on this account, the\r\nexhibition of purgative medicines should be so timed, that their effects\r\nmay be expected during the day.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the time of administering a remedy must be regulated by\r\nthe stage of the disease; thus, in fevers, a dose of opium will either\r\nincrease the heat of the body, augment thirst and restlessness, or\r\noccasion tranquillity and sleep, according to the temperature of the\r\nbody at the time of its administration; for this reason Dr. Currie\r\nadvises us not to give the evening dose of Opium in Typhoid fevers, till\r\nvery late, or about one or two o’clock in the morning, when the heat is\r\nsubsiding, and moisture is coming on. Emetics administered for the cure\r\nof the slighter cases of Pyrexia should be given in the evening, as\r\ntheir operation leaves a tendency to sleep and diaphoresis, which it is\r\nuseful to promote. Remedies that require to be _absorbed_ will probably\r\nbe more efficient in the morning after sleep; the old custom of giving\r\nmedicines on a morning _fasting_, is not quite so absurd as some modern\r\npractitioners have been led to suppose. Diaphoretics should be always\r\ngiven after the digestive process is ended, for during the performance\r\nof this function the emunctories of the skin are less disposed to\r\naction.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERVALS BETWEEN EACH DOSE must be regulated by the nature of the\r\nremedy and that of the objects which it is intended to fulfil, and\r\nwhether it be desirable or not that the latter dose should support the\r\neffects of the preceding one, or whether there be any fear of a reaction\r\nor collapse taking place after the effect of one dose has subsided,\r\nunless immediately repeated; thus the effects of diffusible stimulants,\r\nsuch as ammonia and æther, are very evanescent, they should therefore be\r\nrepeated at short intervals; the same may be said of _Diaphoretics_,\r\nespecially the lenient ones; we ought not to allow the period between\r\nthe doses to be so remote as to occasion any striking abatement in the\r\nimpression: so Opium, where its primary and stimulant operation is\r\nrequired, as in diseases of debility, such as fevers of the typhoid\r\ntype, should be given in small doses at short intervals, so that it may\r\nenkindle and sustain a uniform and regular state of excitement: but\r\nwhere the object is to mitigate pain, allay irritation, and produce\r\nsleep, it ought to be exhibited in full doses, at distant intervals.\r\nThere is a caution also which it is very necessary to impress upon the\r\npractitioner, respecting the power which some medicines possess of\r\n_accumulating_[288] in the system; this is notorious with regard to Lead\r\nand Mercury, and probably with the preparations of Arsenic, and some\r\nother metallic compounds. Dr. Withering has observed that the repetition\r\nof small doses of _Digitalis_, at short intervals, till it produces a\r\nsensible effect, is an unsafe practice, since a dangerous accumulation\r\nwill frequently take place before any signals of forbearance present\r\nthemselves. I have already alluded to the possibility of mercurial\r\naccumulation, and its developement at a remote period.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL PECULIARITIES, or IDIOSYNCRASIES, will sometimes render\r\nthe operation of the mildest medicine poisonous, “_Virum novi_,” says\r\nGaubius, “_qui cum fatuum lapidum cancrorum pulvisculum ingessit, vix\r\nmitius afficitur quam alii ab Arsenico_.” I have seen a general\r\nErysipelas follow the application of a blister, and tormina of the\r\nbowels, no less severe than those produced by the ingestion of\r\n_Arsenic_, attend the operation of purgatives composed of _Senna_! In\r\nsome constitutions Antimony has been known to produce a ptyalism; Dr.\r\nJames assured Sir George Baker that he knew six instances of it,\r\nalthough the patients thus affected had neither their teeth loosened,\r\nnor their breath made offensive. The peculiar susceptibility of certain\r\nindividuals to the effects of particular plants is also very singular:\r\nMurray relates that unpleasant symptoms have been experienced by merely\r\nkeeping _Aconite_ for some time in the hand, or on the bosom. I am\r\nacquainted with two persons in whom the odour of Ipecacuan always\r\nproduces a most distressing dyspnæa; Mr. Chevalier informs us, that he\r\nonce knew a lady who could not take _Powdered_ Rhubarb, without an\r\nerysipelatous efflorescence almost immediately shewing itself on the\r\nskin, and yet she could take it in the form of _Infusion_ with perfect\r\nimpunity. There are some idiosyncrasies so singular and incredible, that\r\nnothing but unimpeachable testimony could sanction our belief in their\r\nexistence. Schenkius relates a case in which the general law of\r\nastringents and cathartics was always reversed. Donatus tells us of a\r\nboy whose jaws swelled, whose face broke out in spots, and whose lips\r\nfrothed, whenever he eat an egg.\r\n\r\nThe late Pope Pius VII. had such an antipathy to musk, that on one\r\noccasion of presentation, an individual of the company having been\r\nscented with that perfume, his holiness was obliged to dismiss the party\r\nalmost immediately.[289] Education, and early habits certainly establish\r\nvery extraordinary peculiarities in different countries with respect to\r\nvarious objects of diet and luxury: what shall we say of the refinement\r\nof the Ancients who regarded the flavour of the Citron with disgust,\r\nwhile the odour of putrid fish was deemed by them so exquisite, that\r\nthey carried it about in caskets of onyx as a favourite perfume! Custom\r\nmakes the Greenlander relish his train oil; and Dr. Heberden tells us,\r\nthat there is a town in North America, where the spring-water is\r\nbrackish, and that, when the inhabitants visit any other province, they\r\nchoose to put salt into their tea or punch, in order, as they say, “_to\r\nmake it taste as it should do_.”[290]\r\n\r\nCLIMATE. Several observations have already been offered upon the\r\ninfluence of Climate in affecting the activity of our remedies.[291]\r\nWith regard to its relations to _Dose_, I have only one remark to make\r\nto the English practitioner, and that by the way of caution, that he\r\nwill not allow his own previous experience in hot climates, or the\r\npersuasions of other tropical practitioners to induce him to administer\r\nsuch doses of Mercury, in England, as may have been found salutary in\r\nIndia, or in other Colonies of similar temperature.\r\n\r\nThe popular scheme of Gaubius for graduating the doses of medicine to\r\ndifferent ages, which was published in several of the former editions of\r\nthis work, is now omitted, as being less easy of application than the\r\nfollowing simple formula by Dr. Young.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 RULE.\r\n\r\n  _For children under twelve years, the doses of most Medicines must be\r\n      diminished in the proportion of the Age, to the Age increased by\r\n      12._\r\n\r\n                      thus at two years to ⅐—viz.\r\n\r\n                                 2   1\r\n                            —————— = —\r\n                            2 + 12   7\r\n\r\n                   At 21 the full dose may be given.\r\n\r\nEvery general rule however respecting the doses of medicines will have\r\nexceptions. Thus children will bear larger doses of _Calomel_ than even\r\nadults, and many medicines which do not affect adults, although\r\nexhibited in considerable quantities, prove injurious even in small\r\ndoses to children.[292]\r\n\r\nIn concluding this part of the subject, it is proper to impress upon the\r\npractitioner the importance of writing his prescriptions in legible\r\ncharacters, and of avoiding all those abbreviations which are not\r\ngenerally understood, or which are capable of misconstruction.[293]\r\n\r\n\r\n  ON THE PARTICULAR FORMS OF REMEDIES, AND THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES UPON\r\n    WHICH THEIR CONSTRUCTION AND ADMINISTRATION ARE TO BE REGULATED.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _SOLID FORMS._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          PULVERES. _Powders._\r\n\r\nThe form of powder is in many cases the most efficient and eligible mode\r\nin which a medicinal substance can be exhibited, more especially under\r\nthe following circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          1. _Simple Powders._\r\n\r\n1. Whenever a remedy requires the combination of all, or most of its\r\nprinciples, to ensure its full effects, as _Bark_, _Ipecacuan_, _Jalap_,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n2. Where medicinal bodies are insoluble, and indisposed to undergo those\r\nessential changes, _in transitu_, which render them operative; for it\r\nmust be remembered that by minute division, every particle is presented\r\nto the stomach in a state of activity, being more immediately exposed to\r\nthe solvent or decomposing powers of that organ.\r\n\r\n3. Where the mechanical condition of the substance is such as to\r\noccasion irritation[294] of the stomach, as the _Sulphuretum Antimonii_,\r\nor in external applications to produce an improper effect upon the skin,\r\nas _Hydrargyri nitrico-oxydum_.\r\n\r\nThe degree of fineness to which substances should be reduced by\r\npulverization, in order to obtain their utmost efficacy, is a very\r\nimportant question. The impalpable form appears to be extremely\r\ninjurious to some bodies, as to _cinchona_, _rhubarb_, _guaiacum_, and\r\nto certain aromatics, in consequence, probably, of an essential part of\r\ntheir substance being dissipated, or chemically changed by the\r\noperation. Fabbroni, for instance, found by experiment that cinchona\r\nyielded a much larger proportion of soluble extractive, when only\r\ncoarsely powdered. I think it may be laid down as a general rule, that\r\n_extreme pulverization assists the operation of all substances whose\r\nactive principles are not easily soluble, and of compound powders whose\r\ningredients require, for their activity, an intermixture; whilst it\r\ncertainly injures, if it does not destroy, the virtues of such as\r\ncontain as their active constituent, a volatile principle which is\r\neasily dissipated, or extractive matter which is readily oxidized_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         2. _Compound Powders._\r\n\r\nThe disintegration of a substance is much accelerated and extended by\r\nthe addition of other materials; hence the pharmaceutical aphorism of\r\nGaubius, “_Celerior atque facilior succedat composita, quam simplex\r\npulverisatio._” Thus several refractory vegetable bodies, as _myrrh_,\r\n_gamboge_, &c. are easily reduced by triturating them with sugar or a\r\nhard gum; and some gum resins, as _assafœtida_ or _scammony_, by the\r\naddition of a few drops of almond oil. Upon the same principle the\r\nPharmacopœia directs the trituration of aloes with clean white sand, in\r\nthe process for preparing _Vinum Aloes_, to facilitate the pulverization\r\nand to prevent the particles of aloes, when moistened by the liquid,\r\nfrom running together into masses; some dispensers very judiciously\r\nadopt the same mechanical expedient in making a tincture of myrrh; so\r\nagain, in ordering a watery infusion of opium, it will be judicious to\r\nadvise the previous trituration of the opium with some hard and\r\ninsoluble substance, as directed in the _Pulvis Cornu Usti cum Opio_,\r\notherwise its particles will adhere with tenacity, and the water be\r\naccordingly unable to exert a solvent operation upon its substance.[295]\r\nIt is equally evident that in the construction of compound medicinal\r\npowders, the addition of an inert ingredient, which the mere chemist\r\nmight condemn and discard as useless, not unfrequently acts a very\r\nimportant part in the combination, owing to its effects in dividing and\r\ncomminuting the mere active constituents: the _sulphate of potass_ in\r\nDover’s powder acts merely in dividing and mixing more intimately the\r\nparticles of opium and ipecacuan: the _phosphate of lime_ appears to act\r\nin the same mechanical manner in the Antimonial Powder; so again, in the\r\n_Pulvis Contrajervæ compositus_, the prepared oyster shells may be a\r\nnecessary ingredient: in the _Pulvis Jalapæ compositus_ of the Edinburgh\r\nCollege, the cream of tartar greatly increases the activity of the\r\njalap, by breaking down its substance and dividing its particles; and\r\nVan Swieten observes that the operation of this resinous purgative is\r\nimproved by bruising it with sugar, and adding some aromatic. The old\r\ncombination of _Pulvis Helvetii_ consisted of alum and dragon’s blood,\r\nand there can be no doubt but that the effect of this latter ingredient,\r\nwhich has been often ridiculed, was to retard the solution of alum in\r\nthe stomach, in consequence of which the preparation was likely to\r\nproduce less inconvenience, and could therefore be administered in\r\nlarger doses; the Edinburgh college has substituted gum Kino in their\r\n_Pulvis Aluminis compositus_, which may have the same effect in\r\nmodifying the solubility of the alum.\r\n\r\nIn rubbing together different substances, it is necessary to remember\r\nthat there are many saline bodies, which in the dry state become moist\r\nand even liquid, by triture with each other, and that, under such\r\ncircumstances, they are susceptible of mutual decomposition. This change\r\nis effected by the action of water, derived from the following sources.\r\n\r\n1. _From the water of crystallization._ This always operates when the\r\nproportion contained in the original ingredients is greater than that\r\nwhich the products can dispose of; that is to say, whenever the capacity\r\nof the new compound for water is less than that of the original\r\ningredients. By previously driving off this water by heat, we shall of\r\ncourse avoid such a source of solution, and no liquefaction can ensue.\r\nThus, if recently burnt quick-lime be triturated with calomel, the\r\nresulting mixture will be white, shewing that no decomposition can have\r\narisen, but add a few drops of water, and it instantly assumes a dark\r\naspect. If _crystallized_ sulphate of copper be triturated with Acetate\r\nof lead, the resulting mixture will assume a fine green colour, but if\r\nthe sulphate of copper be previously heated, and its water of\r\ncrystallization driven off, no change of colour will be produced; if,\r\nfor Acetate of lead, we substitute muriate of lime, and the sulphate of\r\ncopper be _crystallized_, we shall obtain a result of a yellow colour,\r\nbut if the sulphate of copper be _anhydrous_, the product will be\r\ncolourless, becoming however instantly yellow, like the former, on the\r\naddition of a drop of water; and on a further addition of this fluid,\r\nthe yellow product in both instances will be rendered blue; which proves\r\nthat a chemical decomposition has taken place, and a muriate of copper\r\nresulted; for this salt is rendered _yellow_ by a small, and _blue_ by a\r\nlarger proportion of water. The _Cuprum Ammoniatum_ presents another\r\nillustration, for the ingredients, when rubbed together, become\r\nextremely moist, and undergo a chemical decomposition. Certain resinous\r\nbodies also, as _myrrh_, become liquid by triture with alkaline salts,\r\nin which case the resin and alkali form a soluble compound, which the\r\nwater of crystallization, thus set at liberty, instantly dissolves.\r\n\r\n2. _From aqueous vapour in the atmosphere._ The water of the atmosphere\r\ndoes not act upon these occasions, unless it be first attracted and\r\nabsorbed by one of the triturated bodies; e. g. if Acetate of lead and\r\nrecently burnt alum be triturated together, no change will be produced;\r\nbut, if the burnt alum be previously exposed for a short time to the\r\natmosphere, these bodies will, in that case, become liquid.\r\n\r\nThe physician, without this chemical knowledge, will be often betrayed\r\ninto the most ridiculous blunders, an instance of which very lately came\r\nto my knowledge in a prescription for the relief of cardialgia and\r\nconstipation, in the case of dyspepsia; it directed _sulphate of soda_\r\nand _carbonate of potass_, in the form of a powder, but the _fiat_ of\r\nthe physician, upon this occasion, only served to excite the ridicule of\r\nthe dispenser, who soon discovered that the ingredients in his mortar\r\ndissolved into liquid.\r\n\r\nDuring the exhibition of powders containing insoluble matter, it is\r\nalways important to maintain a regularity in the alvine excretions, or\r\nan accumulation may take place attended with very distressing symptoms.\r\nDr. Fothergill relates a case of this kind which succeeded the use of\r\npowdered bark; and Mr. E. Brande has communicated a similar instance of\r\nmechanical obstruction, produced by the habitual use of magnesia. I\r\ncould also add, if it were necessary, some striking facts of a similar\r\ntendency, which occurred from eating bread that had been adulterated\r\nwith pulverized _felspar_. The precaution seems more particularly\r\nnecessary in the case of children, whose bowels are very impatient of\r\nextraneous and insoluble contents.[296] The dose of a powder ought not\r\nto exceed ʒj; and, when taken, should be diffused in water, wine, or any\r\nother convenient liquid; resinous and metallic powders require a thick\r\nand consistent vehicle, as syrup or honey, since they subside from those\r\nwhich are more fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PILULÆ. _Pills._\r\n\r\nThese are masses of a consistence sufficient to preserve the globular\r\nform, and yet not so hard as to be of too difficult solution in the\r\nstomach. The subject offers some extremely interesting points of\r\ninquiry. The following general rules will enable the practitioner to\r\nselect those substances to which the form of pill is adapted, and to\r\nreject those to which it is not suitable, as well as to direct,\r\n_extemporaneously_, the most efficient mode of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    I. THE SELECTION OF SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n1. _Suitable Substances_ are, 1, All remedies which operate in small\r\ndoses, as _Metallic Salts_; and 2, Those which are designed to act\r\nslowly and gradually, as certain _Alterative Medicines_, or 3, which are\r\ntoo easily soluble when exhibited in other forms, as _Gamboge_, &c. 4,\r\nSubstances which are not intended to act until they reach the larger\r\nintestines, as in pills for habitual costiveness; _see Aloes_. 5, Bodies\r\nwhose specific gravities are too considerable to allow their suspension\r\nin aqueous vehicles. _Efflorescent_ salts may also be exhibited in this\r\nform, but they ought to be first deprived of their water of\r\ncrystallization, or the pills composed of them will crumble into powder\r\nas they dry.\r\n\r\n2. _Unsuitable Substances_ are, 1, Those which operate only in large\r\ndoses. 2, Which deliquesce. 3, Whose consistence is such as to require a\r\nvery large proportion of dry powders to afford them a suitable tenacity,\r\nas _oils, balsams_, &c. 4, Substances that are so extremely insoluble,\r\nthat when exhibited in a solid form they pass through the canal\r\nunaltered, as certain _extracts_.\r\n\r\nMany remedies which are incompatible with each other in solution, may be\r\ncombined in pills, unless indeed their medicinal powers are adverse or\r\ninconsistent, or their divellent affinities sufficiently powerful to\r\novercome their state of aggregation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    II. THEIR FORMATION INTO MASSES.\r\n\r\nThis is a subject of far greater importance than is usually assigned to\r\nit, as will be more fully explained in the sequel.\r\n\r\n1. Many substances, as _vegetable extracts_, may be formed into pills\r\nwithout any addition; others, as _gum resins_, become sufficiently soft\r\nby being beaten, or by the addition of a drop or two of spirit, or\r\n_liquor potassæ_. Some dry substances react upon each other, and\r\nproduce, without the addition of any foreign matter, soft and\r\nappropriate masses. The _Pilulæ Ferri Compositæ_, of our Pharmacopœia\r\nafford a very striking example of this peculiar change of consistence,\r\nwhich the mutual reaction of the ingredients produces by simple triture.\r\nThe _Pilulæ Aloes Compositæ_ offer another instance; for the extract of\r\ngentian, upon being triturated with aloes, produces a very soft mass, so\r\nthat the addition of a syrup, as directed by the Pharmacopœia, is quite\r\nunnecessary. See _Form: 12_.\r\n\r\n2. Many substances are, in themselves, so untractable, that the addition\r\nof some matter foreign to the active ingredients, is absolutely\r\nessential for imparting convenience of form. It is generally considered\r\nthat very little skill and judgment is required in the selection of such\r\na substance, provided it can fulfil the _mechanical_ intention just\r\nalluded to—the fact however is, that _the medicinal power of the pill\r\nmay be materially controlled, modified, or even subverted, by the mode\r\nin which it is formed into a mass_. Where the active element of a pill\r\nis likely to be improved by minute division, a gummy or resinous\r\nconstituent may be usefully selected: under the history of Aloes, I have\r\nalluded to a popular pill, known by the name of the _dinner-pill_, in\r\nwhich case the _mastiche_ divides the particles of the aloes, and\r\nmodifies the solubility of the mass. The _Pilulæ Opii_ of the former\r\nPharmacopœia of London, consisted of equal proportions of opium and\r\nextract of liquorice, and the mass was so insoluble that its effects\r\nwere extremely uncertain and precarious; in the present edition, soap\r\nhas been very judiciously substituted; but in certain cases where we\r\nwish to protract the influence of opium, or that of any other active\r\nbody, so as not to obtain its full effects at once, we may very\r\nadvantageously modify its solubility by combining it with a gum resin or\r\nsome substance which will have the effect of retarding its solution in\r\nthe stomach. The _Pilulæ Styrace_ of the Dublin college, presents itself\r\nas an efficient example of this species of pharmaceutical address; see\r\nalso _Form. 10, 11, 12_. I am well acquainted with many formulæ whose\r\nutility has been sanctioned by experience, and I have no hesitation in\r\nbelieving that their salutary mode of operation would receive a\r\nplausible explanation from this simple law of combination. Dr. Young has\r\nvery justly stated in his Medical Literature,[297] that the _balsam of\r\ncopaiba_ envelopes metallic salts, so as to lessen their activity; he\r\nsays that the sub-carbonate of iron, made into pills with copaiba, was\r\ngiven for some weeks without any apparent effect; and that a few hours\r\nafter the same quantity had been given, with gum only, the fæces were\r\nperfectly black. I do not know a more striking and instructive proof of\r\nthe influence of a glutinous or viscid constituent, in wrapping up a\r\nmetallic salt, and defending the stomach from its action, than is\r\npresented in the case published by the medical attendant Mr. Marshall,\r\nin consequence of the attempt of Eliz. Fenning to poison the family of\r\nMr. Turner of Chancery-lane by arsenic, which she providentially\r\nadministered in a heavy yeast dumpling. _Soap_ is very frequently used\r\nfor the formation of pill-masses, and it is an excellent constituent for\r\nsubstances likely to be injured by meeting with an acid in the _primæ\r\nviæ_; many resinous bodies may also be reduced to a proper consistence\r\nby soap, although in prescribing it, its levity should be attended to,\r\nor otherwise the pills will be too bulky; in general it will combine\r\nwith an equal portion of any resinous powder, as _Rhubarb_, _Jalap_,\r\n_&c._; it is of course ineligible where the substances are decomposed by\r\nalkalies, as _Tartarized Antimony_; this last precaution will also apply\r\nto _aromatic confection_ as a vehicle, on account of the carbonate of\r\nlime contained in it. The _Conserve of Roses_ has the advantage of\r\nretaining its consistency much longer than mucilage, but as it contains\r\nan uncombined acid, it is frequently inadmissible; it could not for\r\ninstance be with propriety employed with the precipitated sulphuret of\r\nantimony. Pills made with mucilage, are apt to crumble when they are\r\nrolled out; this is the case with the _Pilulæ Hydrargyri submuriatis_;\r\nsome extract therefore would be a more convenient constituent; in this\r\nparticular case, however, the addition of a few drops of spirit would\r\nsupersede the necessity of _any_ constituent. Castor oil, in some cases,\r\nespecially with some of the harder purgative extracts, will impart an\r\neligible consistence.\r\n\r\n_Crumb of bread_, furnishes a convenient vehicle for those salts which\r\nare ponderous, active in very small doses, or which are liable to be\r\ndecomposed by other vehicles; but an objection is attached even to this,\r\nfor it is liable to become so dry and hard when kept, that pills made\r\nwith it will frequently pass undissolved. Swediaur mentions this fact\r\nwith reference to Plenck’s mercurial pill, as well as to one of\r\ncorrosive sublimate, and he proposes for this reason to substitute\r\n_starch_; the addition however of a small portion of sugar will prevent\r\nthe bread from becoming thus indurated, and with such a precaution it\r\nmay be very safely employed. For the purpose of forming active vegetable\r\npowders into pills, such as _Digitalis, Conium_, &c., I am informed by\r\nMr. Hume of Long Acre, that in his experience _melasses_ or _treacle_ is\r\nthe best constituent that can be selected, for it undergoes no\r\ndecomposition by time, but maintains a proper consistency, and preserves\r\nthe sensible qualities of the plant quite unimpaired for many years. I\r\nhave deposited in the cabinet of the College, specimens of such pills,\r\nof _hemlock_ and _foxglove_, which retain the characteristic odour of\r\nthese vegetables, notwithstanding they have been now made for several\r\nyears. _Honey_ has likewise the property of preserving vegetable\r\nsubstances; _seeds_ may be kept in it for any length of time, some of\r\nwhich, on being taken out, washed, and planted, will even vegetate. It\r\nhas also been used for the preservation of animal matter; the bodies of\r\nthe Spartan kings, who fell at a distance in battle, were thus\r\npreserved, in order that they might be carried home.[298]\r\n\r\n_Water_ will on some occasions be found a convenient expedient; powdered\r\n_Rhubarb_ or _Jalap_ may be thus made into masses without any increase\r\nof bulk, but the pills will be apt, if kept, to become mouldy.\r\n\r\n3. In the formation of pills the ingredients should be hastily rubbed\r\ntogether, whenever they are liable to be injured by long exposure to the\r\nair; thus in the formation of _Pilulæ Hydrargyri submuriatis compositæ_,\r\nthe compound is rendered less active by too long continued triture. See\r\n_Pulveres_.\r\n\r\n4. In dividing pill-masses, it is usual to add to them, and envelope\r\nthem in, magnesia; where calomel is present, I have satisfied myself by\r\nexperiment that a _muriate of magnesia_ is formed under such\r\ncircumstances, and it is owing to this partial decomposition, that the\r\nsurface of the pill exhibits a greenish hue; starch, powder of\r\nliquorice,[299] or orrice root, might perhaps under such circumstances\r\nbe more judiciously preferred. In Germany, the powder of _Lycopodium_ is\r\ngenerally used. Formerly, the pill was covered with gold leaf, which\r\nprotected it from the influence of the stomach, and frequently rendered\r\nit unavailing.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that many of the pill-masses directed in our\r\nPharmacopœias, are liable to become so hard[300] and dry by being kept,\r\nthat they are unfit for that division for which they were originally\r\nintended; indeed Dr. Powel considers it doubtful whether the greater\r\nnumber of articles had not better be kept in powder, and their\r\napplication to the formation of pills left to extemporaneous direction;\r\nthe necessity of this is farther apparent, when we learn that it is a\r\ncommon practice for the dispenser to soften these masses by the\r\napplication of a hot spatula, or pestle, which sometimes carbonizes, and\r\nfrequently decomposes them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    III. THEIR FORM OF PRESCRIPTION.\r\n\r\nIn our extemporaneous directions, it is necessary to apportion with\r\naccuracy the quantity of active materials which we may wish each pill to\r\ncontain, and since the proportion of the _constituent_ can rarely be\r\nexactly defined, the equable division of the whole mass, into a given\r\nnumber of pills, will be safer than defining the weight of each pill.\r\n\r\nA pill, the bulk of whose ingredient is vegetable matter, ought not to\r\nexceed five grains in weight, but where the substances which compose it\r\nare metallic and ponderous, it may without inconvenience weigh six or\r\neven eight grains.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TROCHISCI. _Troches_, or _Lozenges_.\r\n\r\nAs these are regarded as objects rather of confectionary than of\r\npharmacy, the London and Dublin Colleges have not condescended to notice\r\nthem; the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, however, contains several formulæ for\r\ntheir preparation; and as the form of lozenge offers a very commodious\r\nand efficacious method of administering certain remedies, the theory of\r\nits operation deserves some notice in the present work. It is\r\nprincipally useful in cases where it is an object that the remedy should\r\npass _gradually_ into the stomach, in order to act as powerfully as\r\npossible upon the pharynx and top of the trachea, as in certain\r\ndemulcents or astringents; for instance, _Nitre_, when intended to\r\noperate in relaxed or inflamed states of the tonsils, is best applied in\r\nthis manner; so is _Sulphate of Zinc_ in chronic coughs, attended with\r\ninordinate secretion. In order to retard as long as possible the\r\nsolution of the lozenge in the mouth, it ought to be composed of\r\n_several_ demulcent substances, such as farinaceous matter, sugar, gum,\r\nand isinglass; for such a mixture will be found to answer the purpose\r\nbetter than any _one_ of these articles taken by itself; thus the\r\nfarinaceous matter will prevent the sugar and the gum from being too\r\nsoon dissolved; the viscidity of the sugar and gum will prevent the\r\nfarinaceous matter from being swallowed as soon as it would otherwise\r\nbe; and the isinglass will give a softness to the whole, and thus\r\nprevent any sharp points from stimulating the membrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     SUPPOSITORIA. _Suppositories._\r\n\r\nThis form of preparation is very ancient, and although it has of late\r\nyears fallen into disuse, it affords an efficacious mode of\r\nadministering many powerful remedies, and in some instances of producing\r\neffects which the same medicine would not command if given in any other\r\nform: besides which, it is found that after the stomach by long use has\r\nlost its susceptibility to the action of medicine, such a substance will\r\noperate with fresh and unabated force if applied to the rectum. There\r\nare two great indications which _Suppositories_ are calculated to\r\nfulfil, _viz._\r\n\r\n1, _The alleviation of pain and irritation_, especially when it arises\r\nfrom diseases of the bladder, prostate gland, uterus, and other parts in\r\nthe vicinity. Abortion may be thus frequently prevented. To fulfil these\r\nintentions, a mixture of opium with two parts of soap, will be found\r\neligible. I can recommend such an application from a well grounded\r\nexperience in its efficacy.\r\n\r\n2, _The production of Catharsis_. In cases of Apoplexy, from the\r\ncounter-irritation which these remedies are likely to occasion, much\r\nadvantage may arise; and in the failure of more common measures, they\r\nmay be applied with certain success in the cure of Ascarides; see\r\n_Formula 146_. Where a very efficient Suppository is required, one or\r\ntwo grains of _Elaterium_ rubbed up with eight grains of hard soap, will\r\npresent us with a combination of great utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ELECTUARIA. _Electuaries._\r\n\r\nThis is an ancient form of prescription; for although the term\r\n“_Electarium_” is first used by Cælius Aurelianus, yet the ἐκλὶκτον of\r\nHippocrates, and the _Antidotus_, _Confectio_, _Mithridatium_,\r\n_Diascordium_, _Opiatum_, _Orvietanum_, _Philonium_, _Theriaca_, and\r\n_Requies_ of other authors, were all Electuaries. They differ from\r\n_Conserves_ in this, that the sugar in the latter preparations is in a\r\ngreater proportion, and is intended to _preserve_ the ingredients;\r\nwhereas in the former, it is merely intended to impart convenience of\r\nform; see _Confectiones_. Electuaries are in general, _extemporaneous_\r\npreparations, composed of dry powders, formed into a proper consistence\r\nby the addition of syrup, honey, or mucilage; when however the latter\r\nsubstance is employed, the electuary very soon becomes dry and hard: and\r\nwhen common syrup is used, the compound is apt to candy, and in a day or\r\ntwo to grow too hard for use; this is owing to the crystallization of\r\nthe sugar; Deyeux therefore states, that the syrup should be previously\r\nexposed to the heat of a stove so long as it forms any crystals, and\r\nthat the residual liquor, which from the presence of some vegetable acid\r\nhas no tendency to crystallize, may then be advantageously\r\napplied;—_Melasses_ or Treacle may in some cases be employed, and from\r\nexperiments which I have repeated with some care, I am enabled to state\r\nthat the peculiar flavour of this liquid is entirely removed by a simple\r\noperation, which consists in diluting it with an equal weight of water,\r\nand then boiling it with about one eighth part of powdered charcoal for\r\nhalf an hour, when the liquor is to be strained, and reduced by gentle\r\nevaporation to a proper consistence;[301] and moreover it appears, that\r\nactive vegetable powders retain their characteristic qualities when\r\nimmersed in _treacle_, longer than in any other excipient.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn selecting and prescribing this form of exhibition, the following\r\ngeneral rules should be observed.\r\n\r\n  I. Those substances which are nauseous, deliquescent, which require to\r\n      be given in large doses, or which are incapable of forming an\r\n      intimate union with syrup, as _fixed oils_, _balsams_, &c. should\r\n      never be prescribed in the form of an electuary.\r\n\r\n  II. The quantity of syrup directed must be regulated by the nature and\r\n      specific gravities of the substances which enter into their\r\n      composition, viz.\r\n\r\n      1. _Dry Vegetable Powders_ require twice their weight of syrup, or\r\n          of honey.\r\n\r\n      2. _Gummy and Resinous Powders_ require an equal weight.\r\n\r\n      3. _Hard Mineral Substances_ should be formed into an electuary\r\n          with some conserve, as they are too ponderous to remain\r\n          suspended in syrup. It deserves also to be noticed, that in\r\n          consequence of the readiness with which metallic preparations\r\n          undergo change, it will be generally adviseable to keep the\r\n          active ingredients in the form of powder, and to add them to\r\n          the syrup only just before they are required; the Electuary of\r\n          the French Pharmacopœia, which is commonly called “_Opiata\r\n          Mesenterica_,” will furnish a good example, “_quantumvis molle\r\n          fuerit recens, progressu temporis, ob ferrum quod ipsi inest,\r\n          mirè indurescit_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                             LIQUID FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MISTURÆ. _Mixtures._\r\n\r\nThese preparations are generally _extemporaneous_, in which different\r\ningredients are mingled together in the liquid form, or, in which solid\r\nsubstances are diffused through liquid, by the medium of mucilage or\r\nsyrup: for prescribing mixtures the following general rules may be laid\r\ndown.\r\n\r\n  I. Substances which are capable of entering into chemical combination,\r\n      or of decomposing each other, ought not to be mixed together,\r\n      unless it be with a view of obtaining the new products as a\r\n      remedy.\r\n\r\n  II. Transparency is not a necessary condition,[302] and hence\r\n      insoluble powders may be advantageously introduced into mixtures,\r\n      if the following precautions be observed.\r\n\r\n      1. They must be divisible and mechanically miscible in the liquid.\r\n\r\n      2. They must not possess too great a specific gravity.\r\n\r\n      3. They must not render the liquid too mucilaginous or thick;\r\n          _thus_, f℥j _should seldom contain more than_ ʒss _of a\r\n          vegetable powder_, ℈ij _of an electuary_, _and conserve_; _or_\r\n          grs. xv, _or_ ℈j _of an extract_.\r\n\r\n  III. The taste, the smell, and the general aspect of the mixture\r\n      should be rendered as pleasant as possible; _thus milk covers the\r\n      taste of bark, of the tinctures of guaiacum and valerian, and that\r\n      of lime water_; _and a light decoction of the liquorice root\r\n      disguises a bitter taste more effectually than sugar_.\r\n\r\n      The Physician may also produce occasional changes in the\r\n      appearance of his mixture, in order to reconcile a delicate taste\r\n      to its continuance; he never ought however to alter the essential\r\n      part of plans which he finds advantageous.\r\n\r\nA DRAUGHT differs merely from a mixture in quantity; it is usually taken\r\nat once, and should not exceed f℥iss; it should be always preferred\r\nwhen,\r\n\r\n  1. _The remedy is to be taken in a precise dose._\r\n\r\n  2. _Whenever it is liable to spontaneous decomposition._\r\n\r\n  3. _Whenever the action of the atmosphere occasions change._\r\n\r\nIn apportioning the dose of mixtures, the following proportions are\r\nadmissible, although not perfectly accurate. A TABLE SPOON full\r\n(_Cochleare Amplum_) f℥ss. DESSERT SPOON (_Cochleare Mediocre_) more\r\nthan fʒij. TEA SPOON (_Cochleare Minimum_) fʒj. A WINE GLASS (_Cyathus_)\r\nalthough very variable, may be estimated as containing f℥iss. The custom\r\nof measuring the dose of a liquid by dropping it from the mouth of a\r\nphial is very erroneous;[303] it will therefore be proper to dilute an\r\nactive medicine that is to be so apportioned, with at least a triple\r\nquantity of water, that its real dose may not be essentially altered by\r\nany slight variation in the quantity.\r\n\r\nThe temperature at which a liquid medicine should be given may perhaps\r\nmerit a few observations. In general, the ordinary degree of heat is\r\nthat which will best answer the intention, but in cases of dyspepsia,\r\nthe sense of weight and uneasiness, which often follows a dose of\r\nmedicine, will be prevented by giving it in a tepid state. This remark\r\nwill apply to the administration of the _Decoction of Sarsaparilla_;\r\nRefrigerants should of course be given as cool as possible; Camomile\r\nInfusion, and other vegetable Ptisans, which are designed to promote the\r\noperation of an emetic, will be more efficient when warm. In delicate\r\nchlorotic females I have sometimes found chalybeate draughts not only\r\nmore efficacious, but less distressing to the stomach, when exhibited in\r\na tepid state.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ENEMATA. _Clysters._[304]\r\n\r\n                             _“Lavamenta.”_\r\n\r\nThis form of applying a medicine furnishes the practitioner with many\r\nvaluable resources, although the remedy has not escaped its due share of\r\npersecution. Paracelsus bestowed upon it the epithet “_turpissimum\r\nmedicamentum_,” and Van Helmont that of “_pudendum medicorum\r\nsubsidium_.”\r\n\r\nIt is calculated to fulfil the following indications, viz.\r\n\r\n  1. _To promote the tardy operation of a Cathartic, or to evacuate the\r\n      bowels, where, from delicacy of stomach, medicines cannot be\r\n      retained, or from debility of body they cannot be safely\r\n      administered._\r\n\r\nIn the administration of a remedy of this kind, there are two essential\r\ncircumstances, independent of the _strength_ of its ingredients, which\r\nwill modify its activity, viz. IMPULSE and QUANTITY, by which we obtain\r\nthe stimulus of distention; warm water without any adjunct may thus be\r\nmade the means of overcoming those unrelenting obstructions, which had\r\nrefused obedience to more common measures: Clysters, however, when most\r\nforcibly urged, rarely reach beyond the sigmoid flexure of the colon,\r\nand yet when the largest quantity of fluid which the bowels will admit\r\nis introduced with considerable impulse, the local impression is so\r\npowerful that it is at once extended by the medium of sympathy, through\r\nthe whole of the alimentary canal, and very thorough and copious\r\ndischarges result.\r\n\r\n2. _To induce extreme relaxation:_\r\n\r\nWhich is best effected by an infusion of Tobacco. See _Tabaci Folia_.\r\n\r\n3. _To produce Astringent and Anodyne, or Carminative effects._\r\n\r\nCommon starch, with the addition of Tincture of Opium, is the most\r\ncommon and convenient form for this purpose. See also _Assafœtida_,\r\n_Terebinthinæ Oleum_, and _Formulæ 8, 9, 29, 30_. In some cases the\r\ninjection of _cold water_ acts as a powerful astringent, and from its\r\nimpression upon the rectum, will frequently afford instantaneous relief\r\nin the piles.\r\n\r\n4. _To destroy Ascarides._ See _Form. 164_.\r\n\r\n5. _To act as an emollient fomentation._\r\n\r\n6. _To convey nutriment._\r\n\r\nIn the administration of Clysters, for the fulfilment of any of the last\r\nfive indications, it is obvious, that the stimulus of distention should\r\nbe avoided, as being incompatible with our object; the quantity, or bulk\r\nof the solution, ought to be also carefully graduated; to prevent, for\r\nexample, the opiate clyster from being too soon returned, Dr. Cullen has\r\nremarked that it seldom should be made of more bulk than that of three\r\nor four ounces of liquid, and this also of a very mild kind. In\r\nadministering a bitter decoction for the cure of Ascarides, the same\r\nprecaution is necessary, or the gut will suddenly contract and expel the\r\nclyster, which always acts with more certainty when allowed to remain\r\nfor some time. The proportions of fluid vehicle necessary for the\r\ndifferent stages of life, under ordinary circumstances, may be stated as\r\nfollows:—An infant at its birth, or soon after, requires about one\r\n_fluid ounce_; a child between the age of one and five years, from three\r\nto four _fluid ounces_; a youth of ten or fifteen, from six to eight\r\n_fluid ounces_; and an adult may take twelve. With regard to the dose of\r\nthe active ingredient of a _Lavement_, it may be estimated as triple of\r\nthat taken by the mouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INJECTIONES.\r\n\r\nUnder this head may be comprehended the various medicinal preparations\r\nwhich are employed as local applications;—to the urethra for the cure of\r\ngonorrhæa, and to the vagina for that of the different discharges to\r\nwhich females are liable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the former of these it has been truly observed, that\r\n“among the whole class of remedies employed for surgical purposes, there\r\nis scarcely one which has occasioned a greater diversity of opinion;” to\r\nenter however into an examination of this subject would be entirely\r\nforeign to the intention of the present work; it is only necessary to\r\nstate, that for their preparation the same principles of combination,\r\nand the same chemical precautions, apply, as have been already\r\ninvestigated under the head _Misturæ_. In some cases the practitioner\r\nwill find it useful to insure the entire solution of his active\r\ningredient; while in others, the presence of a precipitate may enhance\r\nthe efficacy of the application, as illustrated by _Form. 62_.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of injections for the cure of female discharges, it\r\nmust be remembered that, if they be of a vegetable nature, their\r\nefficacy wholly depends upon the _Tannin_ which they contain, and the\r\nprescriber must therefore take care not to invalidate the force of this\r\nprinciple by any incompatible additions.\r\n\r\nAnd it deserves to be remembered, that as _Tannin_ has the power of\r\ncoagulating animal mucus, and of forming with it an insoluble\r\nprecipitate, its administration, as an injection, is liable to occasion\r\nthe evacuation of whitish or ash-coloured flakes, which will come away\r\nfrom time to time, and excite in the patient’s mind, says Mr. Clarke,\r\nthe apprehension that she is voiding portions of the internal parts of\r\nthe body, unless her mind be prepared for the occurrence by a previous\r\nexplanation, and which the judicious practitioner will not neglect to\r\nafford. In some cases it will be necessary to correct the irritating\r\neffect of the astringent by the addition of a demulcent, as exemplified\r\nin _Form. 61_. In applying this form of remedy an ivory syringe should\r\nbe always preferred to one of pewter, whenever the solution is likely to\r\nbe affected by the contact of a metal.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      INHALATIONES. _Inhalations._\r\n\r\nUnder this general title may be comprehended two distinct classes of\r\nvolatilized substances, _viz._\r\n\r\nDry Fumes (_Suffitus_), and Watery Vapours (_Halitus_).\r\n\r\nBefore we enter upon the consideration of this particular form of\r\nremedy, it may be necessary to state, generally, that it appears to be\r\ncapable of affording a very expeditious and powerful mode of affecting\r\nthe body by certain medicines. If the power of a remedy be so greatly\r\nmodified by circumstances affecting its solubility, as we have already\r\nproved, it cannot be a matter of surprise that the still farther\r\ndiminution of its cohesion should occasion a corresponding influence\r\nupon its energies; indeed it would appear that some few substances are\r\nentirely inert when applied under any other form, see _Hydrargyrum_, in\r\nthe after part of this work. We are, moreover enabled by these means, to\r\nbring various bodies into immediate contact with organs, which are\r\ninaccessible to such remedies in every other state of aggregation. This\r\nobservation applies more particularly to the lungs, and the subject has\r\nlately occupied the attention of a worthy and skilful physician, whose\r\nwork[305] is well entitled to the serious consideration of the\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nThe practice of causing patients to inhale various volatilized\r\nsubstances appears to have been of very ancient date. It has been\r\nalready stated in this work (p. 39) that the fumes of Orpiment were\r\ndirected to be breathed by Galen, and that the practice has been adopted\r\nby practitioners of later date.[306] Few attempts of this kind however\r\nwere made, until the time of our countryman Bennet, the author of\r\n“_Theatrum Tabidorum_,” who arranges volatilized substances into the two\r\nclasses which have been announced at the head of the present section,\r\n_viz._ _Suffitus_, and _Halitus_. The numerous trials which have been\r\nsince made with the different gases must be in the remembrance of every\r\nreader, but unfortunately, the injudicious and empirical spirit with\r\nwhich these inquiries have hitherto been conducted, has thrown such\r\ndiscredit upon the subject, that the practitioner who should resume the\r\ninvestigation, must be prepared to hear his understanding, or his\r\nintegrity, questioned.\r\n\r\nSUFFITUS. _Fumes of Burning Substances._ The particular forms of\r\npulmonary disease in which Tar fumes appear to be most serviceable, are\r\nof the chronic kind; where an inflammatory diathesis prevails, or any\r\ntendency to hæmopthysis exists, the practice cannot be said to be free\r\nfrom danger. In treatment of hooping cough the inhalation of tar fumes\r\nhave been also said to be beneficial. For the mode of applying this\r\nremedy, see _Pix Liquida_.\r\n\r\nThe practice of smoking the roots of _Stramonium_, _Tobacco_, &c. might\r\nwith propriety be noticed under this head. With the respect to the\r\nformer of these remedies, much has been said and written, and asthmatic\r\npatients have occasionally expressed a belief in its palliative powers;\r\nin my own practice however, I have never met with any success that has\r\ninspired my confidence. See _Stramonii Herba_.\r\n\r\nHALITUS. _Aqueous Vapours._ In certain catarrhal affections, when\r\naccompanied with painful and difficult expectoration, benefit may be\r\noccasionally obtained from the inhalation of the steam of hot water, or\r\nof vinegar and water, the acid in this case assisting the expectoration,\r\nwhile the whole acts as an emollient and soothing application to the\r\ntender and inflamed vessels of the internal surface of the bronchial\r\ntubes. The same practice is also highly serviceable in Cynanche\r\nTrachealis, and Tonsillaris.\r\n\r\nIn Pneumonia, after the violence of the arterial excitement has been\r\nreduced by depletory measures, the inhalation of the steam of hot water,\r\nor decoctions of emollient herbs, will often contribute to the support\r\nof an easy expectoration.\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated under the history of Expectorants (_page\r\n106_), that in certain dry states of the air, the evaporation of water\r\nin an artificially warmed apartment, is frequently attended with\r\nconsiderable relief to the pulmonary patient.\r\n\r\nIn Dyspnæa, attended with a spasmodic condition of the pulmonary organs,\r\nvapours impregnated with sulphuric æther have been recommended for\r\ninhalation. Dr. Pearson also states that the efficacy of such an\r\napplication is materially enhanced by dissolving in it a portion of the\r\nextract of Conium. Dr. Bôotcher of Copenhagen, has lately announced the\r\nutility of vapours of camphor, in complaints affecting the cavities of\r\nthe nose, throat, and chest. He states that in the worst case of\r\nstoppage of the nose from catarrh, a piece of camphor need only be kept\r\nfor a few minutes before it, to obtain great relief; the same\r\napplication has been known to produce good in Cynanche Tonsillaris.\r\n\r\nIn order to apply such inhalations we may employ the inhaler invented by\r\nDr. Mudge, or if that instrument be not at hand, the spout of a tea pot,\r\nor a common basin with an inverted funnel, will be found very convenient\r\nsubstitutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   REMEDIES OF EXTERNAL APPLICATION.\r\n\r\nThis class of medicinal agents formerly comprised a much wider range of\r\nforms than it at present contains; such as numerous _Epithems_;\r\n_Vapours_; _Aromatic Bags_; _Medicated Quilts_, _&c._\r\n\r\nThe external remedies of the present day may be divided into two orders,\r\nviz.\r\n\r\n  1. Those whose effects are entirely _local_, as exemplified in the\r\n      application of certain _refrigerating_ embrocations, _stimulating_\r\n      cataplasms, and _astringent_ unguents.\r\n\r\n  2. Those which excite general effects, or produce an influence upon\r\n      parts remote from those to which the remedy is more immediately\r\n      addressed, as illustrated by the operation of mercurial liniments\r\n      and unguents, or by the general tonic effects of adhesive\r\n      plaisters.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the former of these divisions it is unnecessary to\r\nmultiply our remarks; the objects which they embrace belong more\r\nparticularly to the department of surgery, and from the investigation of\r\nthe different modes and forms of external application we shall hereafter\r\nderive very ample and instructive illustrations. In considering the\r\nobjects of the latter division, a very interesting and important\r\nquestion immediately suggests itself for our consideration—How far a\r\nmedicinal substance, when locally applied to the surface of the body,\r\nmay be capable of affecting the general system, or some of its more\r\nremote parts?—the experienced practitioner will feel no hesitation in\r\nadmitting numerous proofs of the existence of such agency; and it would\r\nseem probable that topical applications may produce general effects by\r\nseveral distinct modes of operation, viz.\r\n\r\n  1. _By exciting an impression on the nervous system._\r\n\r\n  2. _By modifying the cuticular discharge._\r\n\r\n  3. _By being absorbed into the circulation._\r\n\r\nIn considering the different forms of external applications, it will\r\nappear that, for their extemporaneous construction, preparation, and\r\napplication, the same scientific knowledge, practical skill, and\r\npathological acumen will be required, as we have already stated to be so\r\nindispensably requisite to enable the physician to prescribe, and the\r\npharmaceutist to prepare the various remedies intended for internal\r\nadministration; although in regard to the former, it may be stated\r\ngenerally that the prescriber will more frequently be called upon to\r\nexercise that species of knowledge and address which enables the\r\npractitioner to impart a convenient and efficient _consistency_ to his\r\nremedy; for an external application is far more dependent upon this\r\ncircumstance for its efficacy, than one intended for internal use.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               LOTIONES:\r\n\r\nRemedies of a liquid nature, designed for external application.\r\n\r\nUnder this generic term, which strictly signifies a _wash_, may be\r\ncomprehended several species of medicines, calculated for the fulfilment\r\nof different indications, as EMBROCATIONES, COLLYRIA, FOMENTA,\r\nLINIMENTA, &c. In some instances these applications are entirely local\r\nin their effects, as where a morbid action of the skin is changed by a\r\nstimulating lotion, as exemplified in the cure of Psora by the\r\n_decoction of Hellebore_, or the relaxed vessels of the tunica\r\nconjunctiva of the eye, by an astringent collyrium; in other cases, they\r\noperate upon parts not in contact with the remedy, through the medium of\r\nsympathetic communication, as where cholic and disorders of the bowels\r\nare abated by the application of warm fomentations to the surface of the\r\nabdomen, or where paralytic affections are relieved by pumping cold\r\nwater on the part affected.\r\n\r\nEMBROCATIONES. These, as the term[307] denotes, are compositions of\r\nspirit, decoctions, infusions, or other liquids, applied by _sprinkling_\r\nor rubbing them on an affected part.\r\n\r\nLINIMENTA[308] are understood to differ from embrocations in\r\nconsistence, the former being of an oily, or mucilaginous density, which\r\nincreases their efficacy by imparting a certain emollient power, in\r\naddition to their other virtues. In popular language, however, liniment\r\nand embrocation are generally considered synonymous terms. They\r\nconstitute a valuable class of remedies, and the observations which Dr.\r\nPercival has offered on their utility well merit the attention of the\r\nmedical practitioner. “Volatile and antispasmodic liniments are highly\r\nuseful remedies, and it is to be lamented that external applications of\r\nthis kind are not more frequently employed, for there is just reason to\r\napprehend that powerful effects might be expected from them in various\r\ndiseases.” In chronic affections of the viscera, such applications\r\nappear highly serviceable, not only from the friction to which they give\r\norigin, but from the influence of that species of sympathy which appears\r\nto depend upon the mere proximity and continuity of parts, and which, as\r\nSir Gilbert Blane has observed, is particularly displayed “in the\r\ncontaining on the contained parts, as that of the integuments on the\r\nsubjacent viscera.”\r\n\r\nCOLLYRIA[309].—Liquid applications to the eyes. The Pharmacopœia\r\nChirurgica contains several different formulæ for lotions of this kind,\r\nsome of which are simply astringent, while others combine also the\r\nvirtues of a stimulant.\r\n\r\n\r\n             CATAPLASMATA.[310] _Poultices_, or _Pultices_.\r\n\r\nExternal applications of a pulpy, and somewhat coherent or tenacious\r\nconsistence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are generally extemporaneous preparations, and are calculated to\r\nanswer several different indications, viz.\r\n\r\n  1. As STIMULANTS, e. g. _Cataplasma Sinapis_, L. D. which generally\r\n      inflames the surface to which it is applied so much as to raise\r\n      blisters; common salt also, _muriate of soda_, constitutes the\r\n      active ingredient of a poultice which has lately been brought into\r\n      considerable repute for the reduction of indolent strumous\r\n      swellings and enlargements of the glands.[311]\r\n\r\n  2. ANTISEPTICS—_Cataplasma Fermenti_, L. (see p. 159.) A powerfully\r\n      antiseptic cataplasm may be also made by stirring finely powdered\r\n      charcoal into a common linseed meal poultice. A cataplasm of the\r\n      boiled carrot, beat into a pulp, has been likewise found very\r\n      effectual in sweetening foul ulcers.\r\n\r\n  3. SEDATIVES. The most efficient of these are composed of _Conium_,\r\n      _Digitalis_, or _Hyoscyamus_, and are eminently serviceable in\r\n      cancerous and scrophulous sores of a highly irritable and painful\r\n      nature, to diminish their sensibility and correct the acrid\r\n      discharges. See _Form. 18_.\r\n\r\n  4. REFRIGERANTS. In the formation of a cataplasm for this purpose we\r\n      must avoid the introduction of substances that are slow conductors\r\n      of caloric; suppose for example our object is to apply the\r\n      _sub-acetate of lead_ in this form, it will in such case be\r\n      judicious to mix the linseed meal, with oatmeal, or crumb of\r\n      bread; for if the former substance be used singly, it is liable,\r\n      from its tenacity, to become hard and dry, and in that state to\r\n      augment the temperature which it was designed to diminish.\r\n\r\n  5. EMOLLIENTS.—(The _modus operandi_ of these agents is explained at\r\n      p. 142.) For which purpose the common farinaceous poultice is the\r\n      most eligible, made by soaking slices of bread in milk, and\r\n      simmering them together over a gentle fire until they are reduced\r\n      to the proper consistence, which ought to be such as to prevent\r\n      its spreading farther than is designed, and yet not so hard as to\r\n      occasion any mechanical irritation; the whole is then to be beat\r\n      smooth with a spoon, and applied as warm as the patient’s feelings\r\n      will readily admit. Some practitioners have doubted the propriety\r\n      of milk as an ingredient in this composition, and have preferred\r\n      water as an excipient, not only because the former is very liable\r\n      to turn sour, but because it does not possess greater powers as an\r\n      emollient than water; the observations of the editor of the\r\n      Pharmacopœia Chirurgica upon this question are judicious, and\r\n      worthy our notice; “the objection,” he says, “will certainly hold\r\n      good whenever stale milk is made use of, or if the same poultice\r\n      be kept too long applied; but if the milk be fresh, and the\r\n      poultice renewed night and morning, we do not know any thing that\r\n      occasionally gives such ease and comfort to the patient as this\r\n      form of cataplasm. If water be substituted for milk, the poultice\r\n      is seldom of sufficient tenacity; it is true that this\r\n      inconvenience may be remedied by the addition of a little linseed\r\n      meal, but in some instances the meal appears to fret and irritate\r\n      the skin so much, that patients undergo considerable uneasiness\r\n      from this cause; an objection to which the cataplasm of bread and\r\n      milk is seldom subject, especially if it be not applied too hot.”\r\n\r\n  Every substance, whether liquid or solid, may become an ingredient in\r\n      this species of composition, and although judicious and\r\n      experienced surgeons have of late very considerably improved the\r\n      form of their cataplasms, yet the principles of medicinal\r\n      combination, which it has been the object of the present work to\r\n      investigate and expound, will suggest many important hints for the\r\n      farther extension of their utility; and although the direction of\r\n      them is more frequently left to the nurse than to the medical\r\n      practitioner, yet in adapting them to each particular occasion\r\n      some share of chemical address may be necessary; we have already\r\n      seen that attention must be paid to the selection of ingredients,\r\n      with respect to their powers of conducting heat, and it is evident\r\n      that care must be taken not to reduce into pulp, by decoction,\r\n      substances that contain volatile principles; while in the\r\n      preparation of active liquids to be subsequently mixed with\r\n      linseed meal, it is equally evident that we must be directed by\r\n      the chemical nature of their composition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     EMPLASTRA. L.E.D. _Plasters._\r\n\r\nThese are solid and tenacious compounds, adhesive at the ordinary heat\r\nof the human body; they owe their consistence to different causes, viz.\r\n\r\n  1. _To a due admixture of wax or fatty matter_, _and resin_, e. g.\r\n      _Emplast: Ceræ_, &c.\r\n\r\nThey may be said to differ only in _consistence_ from liniments,\r\nointments, and cerates; Deyeux[312] accordingly proposes to distinguish\r\nthem by the appellation of _Solid Ointments_.\r\n\r\n  2. _To the chemical combination of the semivitreous oxide of lead with\r\n      oils or fat_, e. g. _Emplast: Plumbi_.\r\n\r\n  3. _To the chemical action of the component parts of the plaster on\r\n      each other_, as _Emplast: Ammoniaci_, &c.\r\n\r\nPlasters are generally kept in rolls, wrapped in paper, and when to be\r\nused they are melted and spread on leather; in performing this operation\r\nthe practitioner ought not to apply a heat above that of boiling water;\r\nfor if metallic oxides be present, the fatty matter will, at a higher\r\ntemperature, reduce them, in consequence of the powerful affinity of oil\r\nfor oxygen at an exalted temperature; and if aromatic substances enter\r\nas ingredients they will thus suffer in their strength, besides which\r\nthe fat itself will undergo a very injurious change by a mismanaged\r\napplication of heat, and the plaster will be less adhesive.\r\n\r\nThey are employed as remedies to answer two general indications;\r\n_mechanically_, to afford support to muscular parts and to prevent the\r\naccess of air; and _medicinally_, to operate as stimulants, discutients,\r\nrubefacients, or anodyne applications. That by affording an artificial\r\nsupport to the various parts of the body, by the application of\r\nplasters, we are capable in certain diseases of effecting much benefit,\r\nis a truth to be explained upon the principles of physiology, and is\r\ndaily confirmed by the results of practice; thus by giving support to\r\nthe muscles of the back, how frequently the stomach is steadied and\r\nstrengthened? Diseases of the kidneys are in the same way very\r\nfrequently relieved by tight bandages around the loins; the existence of\r\nan intimate connexion between the external and internal parts is\r\nstrikingly exemplified by the distressing effects which are often\r\nexperienced in weak habits, such as sickness, giddiness, and other\r\nuneasy sensations, from a want of any usual compression, as that of\r\nstays, under-waistcoats, &c. The support afforded to persons who have\r\nbeen tapped in Ascites is another instance. I have also lately met with\r\na case in which a morbidly relaxed state of the bowels had harassed the\r\npatient for several years, and set at defiance every astringent\r\nmedicine; upon the application, however, of a tight bandage around the\r\nabdomen, the healthy action of the intestines has been completely\r\nrestored. Sir Gilbert Blane has suggested the trial of mechanical\r\ncompression of the head in the cure of Hydrocephalus, and several cases,\r\napparently favourable, have been published. Dr. Thackrey of Cambridge\r\nhas related a very interesting history in support of the practice, and\r\njudiciously recommends the substitution of straps of adhesive plaster\r\nfor the bandages of cloth originally proposed by Sir Gilbert. In\r\nreasoning upon this treatment, it will be found strictly conformable\r\nwith the soundest principles of physiology, and with those views in\r\nparticular, for the illustration of which I have here directed the\r\nreader’s attention to the subject. Where our object is simple support,\r\nwe should of course select a plaster which is the most adhesive and the\r\nleast irritating. Many plasters which have gained great celebrity for\r\ntheir curative virtues will be found to owe all their powers to their\r\nadhesiveness, such is the _Emplastrum Oxidi Ferri Rubri_ of the\r\nEdinburgh Pharmacopœia, for it is impossible that the iron should\r\ncommunicate any tonic effect. The same observation applies to many of\r\nthose empirical plasters which have at different times acquired so great\r\na share[313] of popular applause. In the cure of sore legs[314] the\r\nimportance of adhesive strapping is generally acknowledged, and on such\r\noccasions nothing is superior to the _Emplastrum Resinæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FORMULÆ\r\n\r\n                                   IN\r\n\r\n                      ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\n                                   OF\r\n\r\n                         Medicinal Combination.\r\n\r\n\r\n “_Longum est iter per Præcepta, breve et efficax per Exempla._” SENECA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A COLLECTION OF FORMULÆ\r\n             INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATE THE FOREGOING PRECEPTS,\r\n              and to furnish the inexperienced Prescriber\r\n                            WITH A SERIES OF\r\n                   _USEFUL AND INSTRUCTIVE LESSONS_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    EXPLANATION OF THE KEY LETTERS.\r\n\r\nThe _Modus Operandi_ of the different elements of each formula is\r\ndesignated by a KEY LETTER, or _Symbol_, which is printed in a different\r\ntype, (thus =B=) and placed in the margin opposite to each. This letter\r\nrefers to a corresponding one in the Synopsis, and thereby shews the\r\ndivision containing an exposition of the principles upon which the\r\noperation of the ingredient is supposed to depend.\r\n\r\nTwo or more KEY LETTERS denote that the element against which they are\r\nso placed has several modes of operation, whilst the order in which the\r\nletters succeed each other, serves to shew the relative importance of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhere any one of the letters is _small_, _i. e._ not a capital, it\r\ndenotes that the operation which it is intended to express is only\r\n_incidental_ to, or subordinate in, the general scheme of the\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nWhen any number of elements are included within a _vinculum_ or bracket,\r\nit is intended to shew that they operate but as one substance, or, that\r\nthe virtues of each are not independent of the other; in this case the\r\nKEY LETTER within the bracket expresses upon what principle this unity\r\ndepends, whilst that on the exterior shews the action of such a\r\ncombination upon the base, or the part which it performs in the general\r\nscheme of the Formula.\r\n\r\nLet us exemplify it by a reference to _Formula 78_ which presents us\r\nwith a Purgative, in conjunction with a Stimulant. The base is _Aloes_,\r\nwhich is succeeded by _Scammony_, and _Extract of Rhubarb_; these\r\nsubstances appear by the bracket, to act in unison, a concurrence which\r\nthe interior letter =B= shews to depend upon their being SIMILAR\r\nREMEDIES; the letter also on the exterior shews that its operation upon\r\nthe base depends upon the same principle. We next come to powdered\r\n_Capsicum_, and _Oil of Cloves_; these ingredients are also shewn by a\r\nbracket to act in unity, and the letter =B= in the interior, denotes\r\nthat it is in consequence of their possessing a similar mode of action,\r\nwhilst the letter =G= on the exterior, announces that they act in the\r\ngeneral scheme for the purpose of fulfilling a second indication; at the\r\nsame time the smaller letter _e_ informs us that the combination\r\nlikewise acts as a _corrector_ of the base.[315]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               A SYNOPSIS\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n                       Principles of Combination,\r\n                AS INVESTIGATED IN THE PRECEDING PAGES,\r\n                       ARRANGED IN A TABULAR FORM\r\n                  SO AS TO AFFORD THE STUDENT AN EASY\r\n                     REFERENCE TO THE KEY LETTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n        _A Synopsis of the Principles of Medicinal Combination._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OBJECT I.\r\n                  TO PROMOTE THE ACTION OF THE BASIS.\r\n\r\n Key Letters.\r\n\r\n =A=      A.—_By combining the several different forms, or preparations\r\n            of the_ SAME SUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\n =B=      B.—_By combining the Basis with Substances which are of the_\r\n            SAME NATURE, _i. e, which are individually capable of\r\n            producing the same effects, but with less energy than when\r\n            in combination with each other_.\r\n\r\n =C=      C.—_By combining the Basis with Substances of a_ DIFFERENT\r\n            NATURE, _and which do not exert any Chemical influence upon\r\n            it, but are found by experience, or inferred by analogy,\r\n            to be capable of rendering the stomach, or system, more\r\n            susceptible of its action_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OBJECT II.\r\n   TO CORRECT THE OPERATION OF THE BASIS, BY OBVIATING ANY UNPLEASANT\r\n  EFFECTS IT MIGHT BE LIKELY TO OCCASION, AND WHICH WOULD PERVERT ITS\r\n       INTENDED ACTION, AND DEFEAT THE OBJECT OF ITS EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\n =D=      A.—_By_ CHEMICALLY _neutralizing, or_ MECHANICALLY\r\n            _separating, the offending ingredient_.\r\n\r\n =E=      B.—_By adding some substance calculated to guard the stomach,\r\n            or system against its deleterious effects._\r\n\r\n\r\n                              OBJECT III.\r\n        TO OBTAIN THE JOINT OPERATION OF TWO, OR MORE MEDICINES.\r\n\r\n =F=      A.—_By uniting those Medicines which are calculated to produce\r\n            the_ SAME ULTIMATE RESULTS, _but by modes of operation\r\n            totally different_.\r\n\r\n =G=      B.—_By combining Medicines which have entirely different\r\n            powers, and which are required to obviate different\r\n            symptoms, or to answer different indications._\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OBJECT IV.\r\nTO OBTAIN A NEW AND ACTIVE REMEDY, NOT AFFORDED BY ANY SINGLE SUBSTANCE.\r\n\r\n =H=      A.—_By combining Medicines which excite different actions in\r\n            the stomach and system, in consequence of which_ NEW, _or_\r\n            MODIFIED RESULTS _are produced_.\r\n\r\n          B.—_By combining substances which have the property of acting_\r\n            CHEMICALLY _upon each other; the results of which are_—\r\n\r\n =I=        a. _The Formation of New Compounds._\r\n\r\n =K=        b. _The Decomposition of the Original Ingredients, and the\r\n            developement of their more active elements._\r\n\r\n          C.—_By combining Substances, between which no other change is\r\n            induced than a diminution, or increase in the_ SOLUBILITY\r\n            _of the principles in which their Medicinal virtues reside_.\r\n\r\n =L=        a. _By the intervention of Substances that act_ CHEMICALLY.\r\n\r\n =M=        b. _By the addition of Ingredients whose operation is\r\n            entirely_ MECHANICAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               OBJECT V.\r\n                      TO AFFORD AN ELIGIBLE FORM.\r\n\r\n =N=        a. _By which the_ EFFICACY _of the Remedy is enhanced_.\r\n\r\n =O=        b. _By which its_ ASPECT _or_ FLAVOUR _is rendered more\r\n            agreeable, or its mode of administration more convenient_.\r\n\r\n =P=        c. _By which it is_ PRESERVED _from the spontaneous\r\n            decomposition to which it is liable_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               NARCOTICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n         1. ℞.

The active Principles, or Medicinal Bases, are\r\ndistinguished by CAPITAL LETTERS, placed in coloured compartments, and\r\neach Officinal preparation is marked by a line corresponding in colour\r\nwith that of its active ingredient. Where a preparation contains two\r\nactive ingredients it is distinguished by two coloured lines, as may be\r\nseen in the _Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ comp_. By this expedient the eye, at\r\nonce, recognises the different classes of medicines; all those, for\r\ninstance, coloured _red_ are Opiates; those _blue_, Mercurials; _green_,\r\nAcetic acid; &c. The introduction of colours, moreover, immediately\r\nindicates the basis to which any preparation refers, and thus prevents\r\nthe possibility of doubt or confusion.\r\n\r\nIf we wish to learn the actual quantity of active matter contained in\r\nany given proportion of a compound, we have only to turn the scale until\r\nthe name of such compound coincides with the number in question, when\r\nthe figure opposite to the basis solves the problem; thus—how much opium\r\nis contained in 5 grains of the _Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ compositus_? By\r\nhaving brought this preparation to 5, we shall see ½ opposite to Opium,\r\ndenoting that such a number of grains contains half a grain; for, unless\r\nit be otherwise expressed, the figures denote _grains_ for the solids,\r\nand _minims_ for the liquids. And, since the number opposite to the Base\r\ndenotes the absolute quantity of it contained in those several\r\nproportions of its Officinal compounds, which are expressed by the\r\nrespective numbers opposite to each, it follows that these latter must\r\nall be medicinally equivalent to each other; thus we have seen that 5\r\ngrains of _Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ compositus_ contains ½ grain of Opium, if\r\nwe turn our eyes to the other Opiate preparations we shall perceive that\r\neach has a different number opposite to it, these figures show the\r\nnumber of grains of each which contains ½ grain of opium, and\r\nconsequently those numbers must be all Equivalents; thus 2½ grains of\r\n_Pil. Saponis comp:_ 5 grains of the _Pulv: Corn: ust: cum Opio_, 9½\r\nminims of Tinctura Opii, 10 grains of _Pulv: Kino comp:_ 18 grains of\r\n_Confectio Opii_, 20 grains of _Pulv: Cretæ comp: cum Opio_, and 120\r\nminims, or two fluid-drachms of _Tinctura Camphor: comp:_ contain half a\r\ngrain of Opium, and are consequently all equivalent to each other. This\r\nsystem of Equivalents will be found of much practical value to the\r\npractitioner, by enabling him, at once, to substitute one preparation\r\nfor another, without the risk of altering the dose of its active\r\ningredients. Suppose, for example, a patient had been taking 8\r\nfluid-drachms of _Mist: Ferri Comp._ and that we wish to give the same\r\nquantity of Protoxide of Iron in the form of the _Pil: Ferri comp_. we\r\nhave only to bring the mixture in question to 8, and we shall see 13½\r\ngrs. are equivalent, both these quantities of the respective\r\npreparations containing ⅔ds of a grain of protoxide, or a little more\r\nthan a grain of the Proto-carbonate. Suppose again, that we have an\r\nacetic acid of sp. gr. 1.059, and that we wish to produce, by its\r\ndilution, two fluid-drachms, or any other quantity, of acid having the\r\nstrength of distilled vinegar, the question is, what are the proportions\r\nof water and strong acid to be employed. We have only to bring the\r\nAcidum Aceticum of 1.059, to 120, i. e. to fʒij, and the number opposite\r\nto the strong acid, _viz._ 16, is its equivalent, if therefore we take\r\n16 minims of it, and dilute it with 104 minims of water, we obtain the\r\nmixture required.\r\n\r\nThose who are acquainted with the sliding rule of Gunter, or the\r\nchymical scale of Dr. Wollaston, will immediately perceive that the\r\npresent circular scale is divided upon the same logometric principle,\r\nand that the mechanical addition and subtraction of ratios here\r\nperformed by juxta-position, corresponds in effect to the multiplication\r\nand division of the numbers by which the ratios are expressed in common\r\narithmetical notation. It is not necessary that I should trouble the\r\nreader with the numerous difficulties and embarrassments which have\r\nopposed themselves to the practical success of this instrument. They\r\nhave, after repeated failures, been at length overcome, except perhaps\r\nwith regard to a slight central error, which as it is found in the most\r\naccurate brass instruments, could not be avoided where pasteboard alone\r\nhad been employed. The error, however, is not of the slightest practical\r\nmoment, not occasioning the difference of a hundredth part of a grain.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of active matter, in the several preparations of each\r\nclass, have been, in general, derived from the best authorities,\r\nalthough in many cases they have been deduced from experiments expressly\r\ninstituted for the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PHARMACOLOGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             COMPREHENDING\r\n\r\n              THE MEDICINAL HISTORY AND CHEMICAL HABITUDES\r\n\r\n                                 OF THE\r\n\r\n                 DIFFERENT ARTICLES THAT CONSTITUTE THE\r\n\r\n                            MATERIA MEDICA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “_Omnium Simplicium Pharmacorum vires nosse oportet cum qui aliquot\r\n  compositum est facturus._”\r\n\r\n                                                              _Ætius._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             PHARMACOLOGIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nABIETIS[318] RESINA.

Extractive, a small portion of resin, and a green\r\nessential oil; in the first of which its bitterness resides, in the\r\nlast, a narcotic principle; hence the watery extract is not possessed of\r\nthe nauseous flavour of the plant but retains its bitterness almost\r\nentire; the narcotic principle is therefore dissipated by decoction, but\r\nits tonic and anthelmintic properties are not impaired by that process.\r\nMEDICAL USES. The whole plant is powerfully antiseptic; and its\r\nbitterness renders it stomachic. Infused in ale it forms the beverage\r\nknown by the name of _Purl_. Its powers as a vermifuge has bestowed upon\r\nit the name of _Wormwood._ DOSE, ℈j, ℈ij; and of the infusion, (made in\r\nthe proportion of ℥j of the plant to oj of water,) f℥i-f℥iss.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.

It is dry, semi-transparent, brittle and insipid; by exposure\r\nto the air it undergoes no other change than loss of colour. _Specific\r\nGravity_, 1·515. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in water in every proportion,\r\nforming a viscid solution, (_mucilage_). One part dissolved in water\r\naffords a fluid of the consistence of syrup; and in two parts, a medium\r\nwell calculated for the union of dry powders. Gum is also soluble in\r\npure alkalies and lime water, as well as in vegetable acids, especially\r\nvinegar, with which it forms a mucilage that may be used as a cement,\r\nlike the watery solution, and with the additional advantage of not being\r\nsusceptible of mouldiness.[321] It is insoluble in alcohol, as well as\r\nin æther and oils. By strong sulphuric acid the gum is decomposed, and a\r\nconsiderable proportion of carbon deposited.[322] For a farther history\r\nof its habitudes see _Mucilago Acaciæ_. MEDICINAL USES. It is demulcent\r\nand nutritious; although it appears in certain states of the body to\r\npass through the bowels without change. When triturated with gum-resins\r\nit assists their mechanical division, as in _Form: 30_. OFFICINAL\r\nPREPARATIONS. _Mucilago Acaciæ._ L. E.

L. _Vinegar._\r\n\r\n                  Acidum Acetosum, E. Acetum Vini. D.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. Too well known to require description.[324] CHYMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Acetic acid largely diluted with water, vegetable gluten,\r\nmucilage, sugar, extractive matter, and frequently malic and tartaric\r\nacids, together with small proportions of sulphate of lime, sulphate of\r\npotass, and alcohol. Its composition however varies according to the\r\nfermented liquor from which it is obtained:[325] e. g. wine yields a\r\npaler, purer, and stronger acid than fermented malt liquors or solutions\r\nof sugar, hence the superiority of that prepared in France and Italy.\r\nVinegar is liable to spontaneous decomposition, or to become mouldy, and\r\nconsequently for the purposes of pharmacy it should be distilled; as\r\nhowever the change depends upon the presence of gluten, it may if boiled\r\nbe kept for a much longer time, and if powdered _animal_[326] charcoal\r\nbe previously added, it will become quite colourless like distilled\r\nvinegar, and that without being impaired in strength, whereas it always\r\nbecomes much weaker by distillation. It is a curious circumstance that\r\nthis is the only vegetable acid, except the _Prussic_, that rises in\r\ndistillation in combination with water.\r\n\r\nADULTERATIONS. Sulphuric acid, as it does not produce any turbid\r\nappearance in vinegar, is generally the acid selected for sharpening it;\r\nbut it must be remembered, that the maker is allowed by law, to mix one\r\nthousandth of its weight of Sulphuric acid[327] with it; so that the\r\n_muriate of baryta_ when added to such vinegar may be expected to\r\nproduce 1⅕ grain of insoluble _sulphate_ in every fluid-ounce; if a more\r\nconsiderable quantity of precipitate occurs, we may infer that an\r\nexcessive proportion of sulphuric acid is present; although some\r\nallowance ought perhaps to be made for the presence of the sulphates of\r\npotass and lime, which are always contained in vinegar. Of this vinegar\r\n1000 grains should saturate 148 grains of crystallized sub-carbonate of\r\nsoda; a fluid-ounce of the same, 68–3/4 grains.[328] For the purpose of\r\nmaking the vinegar appear stronger, acrid vegetables, as _grains of\r\nParadise_, _berries of Spurge Flax_, _Capsicum_, _Pellitory of Spain_,\r\n&c. are sometimes infused in it, but by tasting it with attention, the\r\npungency of such substances may be easily detected. For the other\r\nadulterations, see _Acidum Aceticum_.\r\n\r\nThe purest vinegar which I have ever examined is that manufactured from\r\nmalt, by Mr. Mackintosh of Glasgow. The strongest malt vinegar is termed\r\n_proof vinegar_, and is called by the manufacturer No. 24; it is\r\nestimated to contain 4·73 per cent. of real acetic acid.[329] Its\r\nstrength in relation to the other forms of acetic acid, will be seen by\r\nreferring to the MEDICINAL DYNAMETER, and to the table inserted under\r\nthe article ACIDUM ACETICUM FORTIUS. In the former Editions of this work\r\nit was stated, that a Vinegar had of late years appeared in the market\r\nproduced from the distillation of wood, (_Pyroligneous Acid_.) This\r\narticle has now come into very general use; and the manufacturers have\r\nat length succeeded in divesting it of that empyreumatic flavour which\r\nhad so long rendered it objectionable.

D.\r\n\r\n                      _Common Distilled Vinegar._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, fainter and less agreeable than common vinegar\r\n(_Acetum_): _Taste_, less acid; _Colour_, none. SPECIFIC GRAVITY; Mr.\r\nPhillips states, that when prepared according to the directions of the\r\nPharmacopœia, it varies from 1·007 to 1·009; and that 1000 grains of the\r\nlatter require for their saturation, 145 grains of crystallized\r\nsub-carbonate of soda. I apprehend, however, that it will be found quite\r\nimpossible to obtain a dilute acetic acid equal in strength or specific\r\ngravity, to that last mentioned, by the process of the London\r\nCollege;[331] it may even be doubted whether it can be produced of the\r\nspecific gravity 1·007. The general run of distilled vinegar as found in\r\nthe shop of the druggist, varies from 1·005 to 1·006, and contains from\r\n2·80 to 2·826 per cent. of real acid; when of the specific gravity of\r\n1·009 it would contain about 4·73 per cent. Dr. Powell states\r\n(_Translation of the Pharmacop: of London_, 1815) that “one fluid-ounce\r\nought to dissolve at least thirteen grains of _white marble_;” or, what\r\nis equivalent to it, 39·67 grains of crystallized _Sub-carbonate of\r\nSoda_; acid of this strength corresponds very nearly with six degrees of\r\nthe Revenue Acetometer, the proportions being as follow, 100 grains of\r\nPharmacopœia strength will saturate 8·68 grains of crystallized\r\n_Sub-carbonate of Soda_; 100 grains of acid of 6° of the Acetometer will\r\nsaturate 8·70 grains of the salt. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Acetic Acid more\r\nlargely diluted than that in vinegar, with very minute portions of\r\nuncombined mucilage and extractive. SOLVENT POWERS. It is capable of\r\ndissolving all those vegetable principles which are soluble in water,\r\nand in some cases, as in _Squill_, _Colchicum_, and in several\r\n_Aromatics_ and _Narcotics_, its acid appears to extend its solvent\r\npowers; at the same time it often modifies or diminishes the medicinal\r\nvirtues of the substances, as for instance those of _Narcotics_; this\r\ncircumstance considerably limits its pharmaceutical application; when\r\nhowever it is employed, a portion of spirit should be always added, in\r\norder to counteract the spontaneous decomposition to which it is liable,\r\nand the acetic compound should be preserved in stopped bottles. Acetic\r\nacid does not dissolve true resins, but it has some action on gum\r\nresins. MEDICINAL USES. It is refrigerant, and may be advantageously\r\nadministered in hemorrhage; especially in cases where the acetate of\r\nlead has been given, since the solubility of this latter substance is\r\nincreased by it. See Form. 57; externally, it may be a convenient\r\nadjunct to lotions containing lead. _See Form. 147._ In consequence of\r\nits chemical action upon osseous matter, it has been much employed at\r\nthe Gloucester Infirmary to hasten exfoliation of carious bone.\r\nADULTERATIONS. _Sulphuric Acid_ may be detected by a precipitate being\r\nproduced on the addition of acetate of baryta: this test however will\r\nnot answer for its detection in common vinegar, for the reason stated\r\nunder that article. See _Acetum_. _Sulphurous Acid_ may be recognised by\r\ndrawing a little of the vapour into the lungs. The presence of _Nitric\r\nAcid_ may be discovered by saturating the suspected sample with pure\r\npotass, evaporating to dryness, and then treating the product with a\r\nhighly concentrated alcohol, the acetate of potass will be thus\r\ndissolved, but as it exerts no action on the _Nitrate_ it will be found\r\nin the residuum, and may be recognised by its deflagration, when thrown\r\nupon burning charcoal;[332] _Copper_ may be detected by the acid\r\nassuming a blue colour, when supersaturated with ammonia; and _Lead_, by\r\na solution of sulphuretted hydrogen, producing a dark coloured\r\nprecipitate. _Tin_ however is the metal with which distilled vinegar is\r\nmore usually contaminated, for no vegetable acid will act upon lead\r\nwhile any tin is present in the mixture, since the latter, being more\r\noxidable than the former, is exclusively dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ACIDUM ACETICUM FORTIUS. L.\r\n\r\n                          (_Acidum Aceticum._)\r\n                        (_e Ligno Destillatum._)\r\n\r\n                      _vulgo, Pyroligneous Acid._\r\n\r\nThe acetic acid from wood has been very generally introduced to\r\nsupersede the use of distilled vinegar for the purposes of Medicine and\r\nthe Arts.[333] It is at length found to be capable of such complete\r\nseparation from all foreign matter as to afford a perfectly pure acetic\r\nacid, invariable in its acidifying power, and immutable in its chemical\r\nproperties. In justice to the skill and industry of Messrs. Beaufoy and\r\nCo. of South Lambeth, I beg to state that I have examined various\r\nspecimens of this acid from their manufactory, and that I find it free\r\nfrom those impurities which have hitherto constituted an insuperable\r\nobjection to its introduction into the Materia Medica. The purified\r\n_Pyroligneous_ acid, manufactured by this company, and sold under the\r\nname of “_Improved Distilled Vinegar_,” is perfectly free from any\r\nunpleasant taste, as well as colour and sediment; and it forms a limpid\r\nand colourless solution with ammonia. The common distilled vinegar of\r\nthe shops varies essentially in strength as well as purity, differing in\r\nacidifying power from 30 to 40 per cent. in value: it is sometimes 7\r\ndegrees, and at others less than 5, by the Revenue Acetometer;[334] and\r\nhence has arisen the difficulty of procuring an uniform article for\r\nmedical application, a difficulty which the introduction of the\r\n_pyroligneous_ acid seems calculated to overcome, as it may be procured\r\nfrom the manufacturers of any degree of concentration,[335] from 6\r\ndegrees of the Acetometer, or 2·826 per cent. of real acetic acid to 130\r\ndegrees, or 61·49 per cent. of acid; and even of still higher strength\r\nif required; their common, or _Proof_ acid is about equivalent in\r\nstrength to that of the best Malt Vinegar, of which 100 grains will\r\nsaturate 14½ grains of crystallized _Sub-carbonate of Soda_, and\r\nconsequently contains 4·73 per cent. of real acid, and will require at\r\nleast one half part of water to reduce it to the strength of the best\r\ncommon distilled vinegar. It is found that acetic acid of 45 per cent.\r\nreal acid, or of 95° of acetometer strength, dissolves Camphor and the\r\nEssential Oils very readily.\r\n\r\nThe “ACIDUM ACETICUM FORTIUS,” which is now introduced into the Materia\r\nMedica of the London College, is directed to have a specific gravity of\r\n1·046.[336] It is exactly six times the strength of Proof vinegar, or\r\nthe strong Malt vinegar manufactured, but it requires to be diluted with\r\nnine times its weight of water to reduce it to the strength of the\r\nordinary samples of distilled vinegar. Mr. Phillips states, that he has\r\nnot met with acetic acid of greater specific gravity than 1·043,[337]\r\nbeing five times the strength of vinegar of specific gravity 1·009.[338]\r\nThe strongest acid that can be procured is the _Glacial_ acid, which\r\nexists in a crystallized state under 50° _Fah._ It contains 79 per cent.\r\nof real acid, and is consequently of the strength of 167·5 of the\r\nAcetometer. If this acid be kept perfectly still, it may be reduced\r\nseveral degrees below its crystallizing point in a fluid state, when the\r\nslightest agitation of the vessel instantly occasions it to solidify. It\r\nwill greatly facilitate our inquiries into the strength of different\r\nsamples of acetic acid to know, that the representative numbers of\r\nacetic acid and pure white marble coincide on the scale of equivalents;\r\nit therefore follows that the weight of marble dissolved by a hundred\r\ngrains of any acetic acid, will at once represent the percentage of real\r\nacid in such a sample.\r\n\r\nThe Impure Pyroligneous acid, as it first comes over, contaminated with\r\nTar, has, it is said, been very successfully employed as a lotion in\r\nLepra, scrophulous ulcerations, chronic inflammation of the eyes, and\r\nedges of the eye-lids, and for promoting digestion of irritative ulcers,\r\nor those connected with carious bone. It has also been injected into\r\nsinuses to produce healthy discharge and adhesive inflammation.[339] M.\r\nMonge discovered that this acid has the property of preventing the\r\ndecomposition of animal substances; it is sufficient to plunge meat for\r\na few moments in this acid, even slightly empyreumatic, to preserve it\r\nas long as you please. “Putrefaction,” it is said, “not only stops but\r\nretrogrades.” To the empyreumatic oil a part of this effect has been\r\nascribed, and hence has been explained the agency of wood smoke in the\r\npreservation of tongues, hams, herrings, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n             ACIDUM ACETOSUM FORTE, E. Acidum Aceticum. D.\r\n\r\n                           _Radical Vinegar._\r\n\r\nThe process for this preparation has not retained its place in the\r\nLondon Pharmacopœia, as it is now universally superseded by the Acetic\r\nacid distilled from wood. Since however it possesses peculiar chemical\r\nhabitudes, it claims some notice in this work. The concentrated acid\r\nobtained from the decomposition of acetic salts, by the action of\r\nsulphuric acid, is pungent, acrid, and volatile, and when heated with\r\nfree access of air, it takes fire very readily. Its solvent powers are\r\nmuch greater than those of distilled vinegar; it is capable of\r\ndissolving camphor, resins, and essential oils[340] copiously, but they\r\nare precipitated by dilution; it combines with alcohol, and forms a\r\nspecies of ether; with water it unites in any proportion, heat being\r\nevolved by the mixture. Gold, platinum, glass, and earthenware, can\r\nalone retain this acid without being corroded. It blisters the skin\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nI shall conclude this article by the introduction of a Table, which I\r\nhave constructed with considerable care, for the use of the practical\r\nChemist. The accuracy of the results may be depended upon, since it has\r\nbeen tested by several different modes of enquiry. The Medicinal\r\nDynameter will give the equivalents in any other denomination that may\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\n    A TABLE EXHIBITING THE ACETOMETER STRENGTHS, SPECIFIC GRAVITIES,\r\n PERCENTAGE OF REAL ACID, EQUIVALENT VALUE, AND SATURATING POWER, OF THE\r\n               MORE IMPORTANT PREPARATIONS OF ACETIC ACID.\r\n\r\n ┌────────────────┬──────────┬────────┬──────────┬───────────┬─────────┐\r\n │     ACIDS.     │          │        │          │           │Grains of│\r\n │                │          │        │          │           │  Sub-   │\r\n │                │          │        │          │           │carbonate│\r\n │                │          │        │          │           │ of Soda │\r\n │                │          │        │          │           │saturated│\r\n │                │          │        │Percentage│           │ by 100  │\r\n │                │Acetometer│Specific│ of real  │Equivalents│grains of│\r\n │                │strength. │Gravity.│  Acid.   │in Minims. │  acid.  │\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │Acetum          │          │        │          │           │         │\r\n │  Destillatum   │      5·9°│   1·005│      2·80│        810│     8·58│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │       D°       │        6°│   1·006│     2·826│        803│     8·66│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │       D°       │        7°│   1·007│      3·42│        663│    10·48│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │       D°       │       10°│   1·009│      4·73│        480│     14·5│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │Acetum (Proof)  │       10°│   1·014│      4·73│        480│     14·5│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │Acid Acetic:    │          │        │          │           │         │\r\n │  Fort.         │       50°│   1·043│     23·67│         96│     72·5│\r\n ├────────────────┼──────────┼────────┼──────────┼───────────┼─────────┤\r\n │Acid Acet: Fort.│          │        │          │           │         │\r\n │  P.

The fact is, that by diluting this latter preparation with a small\r\nportion of water we augment its specific gravity, a circumstance\r\npeculiar to this acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ACIDUM BENZOICUM. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n       _Benzoic Acid._ Vulgo, Flowers of Benzoin, or _Benjamin_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, small feathery crystals of a brilliant white colour,\r\nwhich are not brittle, but possess a kind of ductility and elasticity,\r\nand, on being rubbed in a mortar, assume the consistence of paste.\r\n_Odour._ As generally met with, it possesses a peculiar aromatic smell,\r\nbut this depends upon the oily matter which adheres to it, for Mr. Guise\r\ninforms us, that on dissolving the benzoic acid in as little alcohol as\r\npossible, filtering the solution, and precipitating by water, the acid\r\nwill be obtained pure, and void of smell, the odorous oil remaining\r\ndissolved in the spirit. _Taste_, rather acrid and sour; _Specific\r\nGravity_, ·667. It is not altered by exposure to air. SOLUBILITY. Four\r\nhundred parts of cold water dissolve but one, although the same quantity\r\nof boiling water dissolves twenty parts, nineteen of which separate on\r\ncooling; in alcohol it is soluble in a much greater proportion.\r\nMEDICINAL USES. It is said to be stimulant and expectorant; in certain\r\ncases of tracheal irritation, a pill, composed of two grains of Benzoic\r\nacid, and three of Extract of Poppy, has been found serviceable.\r\nOFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Tinctura Camphoræ Composita_, L.D. _Tinct: Opii\r\nAmmoniat:_ E. IMPURITIES. The crystals ought not to be discoloured; they\r\nshould dissolve without residuum in alcohol, and when subjected to heat,\r\nought to be entirely volatilized.\r\n\r\nAlthough this acid is commonly procured from the resinous substance\r\ncalled Benzoin, yet it exists extensively in other vegetable, and in\r\nsome animal substances. In the Tonca bean (_Dipterix odorata_) it is\r\nfrequently to be seen beautifully crystallized on its surface. It exists\r\nalso in vanello; cinnamon; cloves; ambergris; in the urine of children,\r\nand sometimes in that of adults, and always in that of quadrupeds living\r\non grass and hay.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ACIDUM CITRICUM. (_Crystalli_) Citric Acid.\r\n\r\n                       _Concrete Acid of Lemons._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, crystals which are right rhombic prisms, white,\r\nsemi-transparent, and persistent. _Taste_, extremely acid, almost\r\ncaustic. SOLUBILITY, f℥j of cold water dissolves ʒx, but of boiling,\r\n℥ij. ʒx of the crystals dissolved in a pint of water, are about\r\nequivalent to one pint of lemon juice, the solution however if kept is\r\nliable to spontaneous decomposition. The following table of equivalents\r\nmay be found of practical use; the author is aware that they do not\r\nexactly agree with the proportions of Dr. Haygarth, but they are the\r\nresults of careful and repeated experiments, and as such they are\r\nsubmitted with confidence.\r\n\r\n     EQUIVALENT PROPORTIONS OF CONCRETE CITRIC ACID AND LEMON JUICE,\r\n           NECESSARY FOR THE NEUTRALIZATION OF ALKALINE SALTS.\r\n\r\n ┌──────────────────────┬──────────────────────┬───────────────────────┐\r\n │     Citric Acid.     │     Lemon Juice.     │A Scruple of Alkalies. │\r\n ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤\r\n │       grs. x.        │        fʒiij         │ Carbonate of Potass.  │\r\n ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤\r\n │       grs. xv.       │        fʒiiij        │   Sub-Carbonate of    │\r\n │                      │                      │        Potass.        │\r\n ├──────────────────────┼──────────────────────┼───────────────────────┤\r\n │      grs. xxv.       │        fʒvij         │   Sub-Carbonate of    │\r\n │                      │                      │       Ammonia.        │\r\n └──────────────────────┴──────────────────────┴───────────────────────┘\r\n\r\nThese alkaline citrates are decomposed by the _oxalic_, _tartaric_, and\r\nthe stronger _mineral acids_, and by the solutions of _lime_ and\r\n_barytes_. _Form. 107, 123, 137, 168._\r\n\r\nCitric acid decomposes the following salts, _viz._ _The Alkaline,\r\nEarthy, and Metallic Carbonates_; _the Alkaline and Metallic Acetates_;\r\n_the Sulphurets of Earths and Alkalies, and Alkaline Soaps_. It is also\r\nincompatible with _Tartrate of Potass_, which it converts into citrate\r\nand super-tartrate of potass. It curdles the milk of most animals, but\r\nit does not produce that effect on human milk, whether applied hot or\r\ncold. ADULTERATIONS. _Tartaric Acid_, with which it is sometimes mixed,\r\nmay be detected by adding to the solution an excess _of Potass_, which\r\nwill instantly form with it an insoluble super-tartrate, and precipitate\r\nin granular crystals, or, if a little of the suspected acid be saturated\r\nwith potass, and then boiled with a dilute solution of muriate of\r\nPlatinum, if tartaric acid be present, a black protoxide of Platinum\r\nwill be precipitated. If we add the tartrate of potass for this purpose,\r\nwe may be deceived, for the citric acid, by neutralizing a portion of\r\nits base, will convert the remainder into super-tartrate. See _Potassæ\r\nTartras_. _Sulphuric Acid_ is known by the acetate of lead producing a\r\nprecipitate, insoluble in nitric acid. _Muriatic Acid_ may be discovered\r\nin the same manner, substituting only an acidulous solution of nitrate\r\nof silver for the acetate of lead. The presence of _Oxalic Acid_ may be\r\ninferred, if the solution, when added to that of sulphate of lime,\r\nproduce a precipitate. Malic acid has the power of precipitating silver,\r\nmercury, and lead, from their solutions in nitric acid, but no doubt or\r\ndifficulty can arise from this circumstance, for the fact of its forming\r\na soluble salt with lime will prevent every chance of accidental\r\nintrusion, and its price at once secures us against its fraudulent\r\nintroduction; it might moreover be easily detected by throwing the\r\nsuspected precipitate upon burning coals, when it would be decomposed.\r\nWhere the presence of _lime_ is suspected, it may be known by dissolving\r\nsome of the crystals in water, saturating the solution with ammonia, and\r\nthen treating it with the oxalate of that alkali, which, if lime be\r\npresent, will immediately separate it in a palpable form. The juices of\r\nmany other fruits besides the lemon and lime, will furnish the citric\r\nacid in abundance, and may be obtained from them by a similar process;\r\ne. g. VACCINIUM OXYCOCCUS, the _Cranberry_; PRUNUS PADUS, the _Bird’s\r\nCherry_; DULCAMARA SOLANUM, the berry of the _Nightshade_; CYNOSBATUS,\r\nvel ROSA CANINA, the hep or fruit of the _Wild Briar_. There are many\r\nplants whose juices contain combinations of the _Citric_ and _Malic_\r\nacids in considerable abundance, such as FRAGARIA VESCA, the _Wood\r\nStrawberry_, and the common _Raspberry_; RIBES RUBRUM the _Red\r\nGooseberry_; VACCINIUM MYRTILLUS, the _Bilberry_; CRATÆGUS ARIA, the\r\n_Hawthorn_; PRUNUS CERASUS, the _Black Cherry_, &c. This fact is\r\ninteresting, since the juices of such fruits have been long known to\r\npossess the property of dissolving the _tartareous_ incrustations on the\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ACIDUM HYDRO-CYANICUM.\r\n\r\n                  _Hydro-cyanic Acid._ _Prussic Acid._\r\n\r\nThis peculiar acid exists in a great variety of native combinations in\r\nthe vegetable kingdom,[341] and imparts to them certain properties which\r\nhave been long known, and esteemed in medicine. It is, however, only\r\nlately, that it has been administered in its simple but diluted form. As\r\nfew practitioners will choose to prepare the acid, it seems unnecessary\r\nin the present work to dwell upon the merits of the different processes\r\nwhich have been proposed for its preparation; for a full account of\r\nthem, as well as for other details of importance, the practitioner is\r\nadvised to consult a work by Dr. Granville, entitled “_An Historical and\r\nPractical Treatise on the use of Prussic Acid. Second Edition. London,\r\n1820._”\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. A colourless transparent liquid, although it occasionally\r\nexhibits a yellow tinge; _Odour_ like that of bitter almonds; _Taste_\r\nbitterish and peculiar: these properties however are soon lost by\r\nexposure to air and light, and the acid undergoes spontaneous\r\ndecomposition. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The true nature of _Prussic_ acid\r\nwas not ascertained until 1815, when Gay Lussac presented to the Royal\r\nInstitute of France, a memoir which at once developed its real chemical\r\nconstitution; and it is now admitted to consist of a peculiar gaseous\r\nand highly inflammable compound of carbon and nitrogen, to which the\r\nname _Cyanogene_ has been assigned, and of hydrogen; the latter body\r\nacting as the acidifying principle, whence the term _Hydro-cyanic_ acid\r\nis well contrived to express its composition. The medicinal, or\r\n_diluted_ acid, however, contains but a small proportion of this\r\nconcentrated compound; according to M. Majendie, one part of the acid of\r\nGay Lussac and eight parts and a half of water, by weight, or one part\r\nof acid with six times its volume of water, constitute the preparation\r\nwhich should be used in medicine; and which, to avoid the possibility of\r\nmistake, ought always to be prescribed as the Acidum Hydro-cyanicum\r\n_dilutum_, and is, in fact, the _Prussic acid_ of Scheele. Dr. Ure, who\r\nhas lately taken considerable pains upon this subject, has constructed a\r\ntable exhibiting the relations between the specific gravities, and\r\nquantities of real acid, in preparations of different strength; from\r\nthese experiments it would appear that an acid of specific gravity 0·996\r\nor 0·997 is such as is usually prescribed in medicine.[342] MEDICAL\r\nUSES. In a sufficient dose, hydro-cyanic acid instantly destroys life by\r\nextinguishing the nervous energy of the body;[343] but it has at the\r\nsame time been observed that animals submitted to its action would often\r\ncontinue to breathe for several hours freely, and to circulate their\r\nblood, although no trace of sensibility or muscular contractility could\r\nbe found after its application. This remarkable property of\r\nextinguishing the general sensibility, without any ostensible injury to\r\nrespiration and circulation, naturally led to a belief that the\r\nhydro-cyanic acid, or prussic acid, might be advantageously used in\r\ncases of excessive sensibility and irritation, particularly when these\r\ntwo morbid states are likely to affect either the respiratory organs or\r\nthe circulation generally. This kind of analogical reasoning, it is\r\nsaid, induced Professor Brera, ten years ago, to administer it in cases\r\nof high pulmonary and other inflammations, in doses of four drops twice\r\na day; when, as we are told, the violence of the disease was quickly\r\nsubdued. The remedy, however, does not appear to have excited much\r\nattention, until after the first essay of Dr. Majendie, who deserves\r\nwhatever credit may belong to its introduction. Seven years of trial\r\nhave elapsed, and the general sense of the medical profession with\r\nrespect to its utility may now be collected. As a palliative in certain\r\nspasmodic coughs, there is reason for supposing that it _may sometimes_\r\nbe useful, but in that species of pulmonary irritation for which it was\r\nat first so greatly extolled, I will venture to assert that it is far\r\ninferior in efficacy to well directed doses of _Conium_. But there is\r\nanother class of diseases in which its exhibition is said to prove\r\nuseful, in dyspeptic affections attended with heartburn; where it is\r\nsupposed to be capable of reducing the morbid irritability of the\r\nstomach, and thereby of enabling the juices of that organ to be more\r\nslowly secreted and of a more healthy character. Dr. Elliotson has\r\npublished the result of his treatment of stomach complaints with this\r\nmedicinal agent, and would appear to appropriate to himself the merit of\r\noriginating the practice, a claim which Mr. Thomson, in the third\r\nedition of his Dispensatory, refuses to concede.[344] As a local remedy,\r\nprussic acid has also received no small share of commendation, and it\r\nhas been said that it is the only application that can be depended upon\r\nfor allaying the cutaneous irritation so frequently attendant upon\r\ncertain impetiginous affections. It must, however, be confessed that\r\nthis medicine is rapidly declining in popularity.[345] Any prejudice\r\nraised against it, upon the ground of its poisonous activity in large\r\ndoses, is too absurd to be believed; the knife and the caustic are\r\nunquestionably powerful, and may therefore become dangerous instruments;\r\nbut who ever blames the surgeon for employing a sharp knife or an active\r\ncaustic, seeing that both are to be directed by his eye, and guided by\r\nhis hand? FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may be conveniently administered in\r\nany liquid vehicle, as distilled water, camphor mixture, or in some\r\nvegetable infusion. See _Supplementary Formulæ_, 1, 2, 3. A question has\r\nlately arisen whether the effects of the prussic acid might not be more\r\nconveniently ensured by the administration of some vegetable[346] in\r\nwhich it exists as a native ingredient; a company of associated\r\nPhysicians, Surgeons, and Naturalists at Florence, have accordingly\r\nexpressed their joint opinion, that the essential oil of the _Prunus\r\nLauro Cerasus_ is to be preferred in medical practice to all other\r\npreparations which contain the hydro-cyanic acid; for, say they, unlike\r\nthe distilled water of the plant, and pure prussic acid, it contains the\r\nsame proportion of active matter, and of the same power, whether\r\nrecently prepared or not; whether made in one place or another; or\r\nwhether it has been exposed or not to the air, light, or heat. They are\r\nalso of opinion that olive oil forms the best vehicle for its exhibition\r\nin the proportion of one ounce to twelve drops of the essential oil.\r\nOther practitioners again prefer _Laurel Water_, made by distilling two\r\ndrachms of the fresh leaves chopped, with four ounces of water,\r\nrecommitting the distilled water twice afterwards on the same quantity\r\nof fresh leaves, and making ultimately four ounces of the menstruum, of\r\nwhich from ♏︎xxx to fʒj every six hours may be given until a sedative\r\neffect is produced. See _Oleum Amygdalæ Amaræ_. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.\r\nHydro-cyanic acid is decomposed by most of the _oxydes_ usually employed\r\nin medicine, particularly by those of _Mercury_ and _Antimony_. The\r\nalkalies do not appear to diminish its efficacy. _Nitrate of Silver_,\r\nand the salts of iron occasion precipitates; nor ought the _sulphurets_,\r\nthe _mineral acids_, or _chlorine_ to enter with it into prescriptions.\r\nDOSE. Of the medicinal, or _diluted_ hydro-cyanic acid, ♏︎ij,–viij.\r\nThere is however considerable difficulty with regard to the strength of\r\nthe dilute acid employed in medicine, since the density is a criterion\r\nof greater nicety than can be conveniently used by the majority of\r\npractitioners; in fact, as Dr. Ure has observed, the liquid at 0·996,\r\ncontains about double the quantity of real acid, which it does at 0·998.\r\nDr. Ure has accordingly proposed another test of the strength of this\r\npowerful and dangerous medicine, which is not only easier in use, but\r\nmore delicate in its indications;[347] it is as follows. To 100 grains,\r\nor any other convenient quantity of the prussic acid, contained in a\r\nsmall phial, add in succession, small quantities of the peroxide of\r\nmercury, (the common _red precipitate_ of the shops) in fine powder,\r\ntill it ceases to be dissolved on agitation. The weight of the red\r\nprecipitate taken up, being divided by four, gives a quotient\r\nrepresenting the quantity of real prussic acid present. By weighing out\r\nbefore hand, on a piece of paper, or a watch glass, forty or fifty\r\ngrains of the peroxide, the residual weight of it shews at once the\r\nquantity expended. The operation may always be completed in five\r\nminutes, for the red precipitate dissolves as rapidly in the dilute\r\nprussic acid, with the aid of slight agitation, as sugar dissolves in\r\nwater. ADULTERATIONS. If, says Dr. Ure, the presence of muriatic acid be\r\nsuspected, then the specific gravity of the liquid compared with the\r\ngravity of the peroxide dissolved, will shew how far the suspicion is\r\nwell founded; thus if 100 grains of acid, specific gravity 0·996,\r\ndissolve more than 12 grains of the red precipitate, we may be sure that\r\nthe liquid has been contaminated with muriatic acid. _Nitrate of\r\nSilver_, in common cases, so valuable a reagent for muriatic acid, is\r\nunfortunately of little use here, for it gives with prussic acid, a\r\nflocculent white precipitate, soluble in water of ammonia, and insoluble\r\nin nitric acid, which may easily be mistaken by common observers, for\r\nthe _chloride_ of that metal. But the difference in the volatility of\r\nprussiate and muriate of ammonia may be had recourse to with advantage;\r\nthe former exhaling at a very gentle heat, the latter requiring a\r\nsubliming temperature of about 300° _Fah._ After adding ammonia in\r\nslight excess to the prussic acid, if we evaporate to dryness at a heat\r\nof 212°, we may infer from the residuary sal ammoniac, the quantity of\r\nmuriatic acid present.\r\n\r\nANTIDOTES. To counteract the poisonous effect of prussic acid, Orfila\r\nrecommends, after full vomiting has been excited, the exhibition of\r\nthree or four spoonsful of oil of turpentine, in the infusion of coffee,\r\nat intervals of half an hour. M. Virey conceives that sulphate of iron\r\nin solution is the best antidote, he having observed that the salt\r\nrestored a cow that was nearly killed by the essential oil of bitter\r\nalmonds. When an overdose has been taken, hot brandy and water, and the\r\nammoniated tincture of iron are recommended by Mr. Thomson; on the\r\nformer I should rely with much greater confidence than upon the latter\r\nantidote, or, in other words, it is from vital agents, counteracting its\r\nsedative influence, rather than from chemical substances, changing its\r\ncomposition, that we can expect any benefit upon such an occasion. For\r\nthe chemical processes by which the presence of this acid may be\r\nascertained, the reader may consult my work on Medical Jurisprudence,\r\nvol. 2, p. 408.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ACIDUM MURIATICUM. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                            _Muriatic Acid._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a liquid of the specific gravity 1·16, a fluid-ounce\r\nof which weighs about 527 grains, and according to Dr. Powell ought,\r\nwhen diluted, to dissolve 220 grains of limestone. _Odour_, strong and\r\npungent; if exposed to the air it emits white fumes. _Taste_, intensely\r\nsour and caustic; it is however the weakest of the three mineral acids;\r\nand no remarkable elevation of temperature is produced by dilution.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The liquid acid is a solution of muriatic acid gas\r\nin water; when of the specific gravity 1·16, according to Davy, it\r\ncontains 32·32 per cent of the gas, which recent experiments have shewn\r\nto be a compound of _Chlorine_ (_Oxy-muriatic acid)_ and hydrogen in\r\nequal volumes. It has therefore received a name expressive of its\r\ncomposition, and is called _Hydro-chloric[348] acid_. We accordingly\r\nfind that the former element is disengaged from muriatic acid by adding\r\nany substance capable of uniting with its hydrogen. For the purpose of\r\nobtaining _Chlorine_, we may take three parts of common salt, one of\r\nblack oxide of manganese, and rather less than three of strong sulphuric\r\nacid.[349] Accounts have been received from Spain, that in the midst of\r\nthe dreadful contagion which reigned in that country, the inhabitants\r\nalways escaped in those houses where fumigations of chlorine had been\r\nused. In our own country, the Penitentiary has lately undergone\r\nfumigation by this gas, under the superintendance of Mr. Faraday.[350]\r\nMuriatic acid gas has also been strongly recommended for the same\r\npurpose; it may be easily evolved by pouring sulphuric acid on common\r\nsalt. If nitric and muriatic acids be mixed, a mutual decomposition\r\ntakes place, of which water, chlorine, and nitrous acid are the results;\r\nthis constitutes “nitro-muriatic acid,” the _Aqua regia_ of the older\r\nchemists. A bath acidulated with an acid of this kind has been\r\nrecommended by Dr. Scott, as a powerful remedy for diseases of the liver\r\nin particular, and as a substitute for mercury in general. On the\r\npossible influence of this bath, I would beg to make one\r\nobservation,—that the extensive application of a dilute acid to the\r\nsurface of the body, is, under certain circumstances, capable of\r\naffecting the bowels. I have witnessed such an effect from sponging with\r\nvinegar and water. In this way the acidulated bath may occasionally\r\nproduce benefit, but it is extremely difficult to conceive how it can be\r\nindebted for its utility to any other mode of operation. (See _Journal\r\nof Science and the Arts_, No. 2.) FORMS OF EXHIBITION. Muriatic acid\r\nshould be administered in some bland fluid, as barley water, gruel, &c.\r\n(_Formula 145._) I have uniformly exhibited it with success in the most\r\nmalignant cases of typhus and scarlatina, during several years extensive\r\npractice in the Westminster Hospital. See _page 157_. We should be\r\ncareful not to apportion its dose in a leaden or pewter spoon. The\r\nantiseptic properties of this acid have been long known; Sir Wm. Fordyce\r\nrelates that a “dry-salter” acquired a large fortune from possessing a\r\nsecret that had enabled him to send out provisions to India in a better\r\nstate of preservation than any others of the trade; his secret consisted\r\nin adding a small quantity of muriatic acid to the contents of each\r\ncask. After a copious evacuation of the bowels, it is in my experience\r\nthe most efficacious remedy for preventing the generation of worms; for\r\nwhich purpose the infusion of quassia, stronger than that of the\r\nPharmacopœia, is the best vehicle. DOSE, ♏︎v-xx, frequently repeated. It\r\nmay be here observed that where the permanent influence of an acid is\r\nrequired, a mineral one should be always preferred, as such bodies\r\nappear to be beyond the control of the digestive process,[351] and are\r\nincapable of being decomposed by it; see _Form. 158_, whereas on the\r\ncontrary it seems probable that the organs of assimilation have command\r\nover those of a vegetable nature, and generally decompose them. Dr.\r\nMarcet has very judiciously noticed this fact in his luminous work on\r\nthe treatment of calculi, and I have ventured to offer some farther\r\nobservations upon this subject, which may be of practical value, under\r\nthe consideration of _Lithonthryptics_, page 123. ADULTERATIONS.\r\n_Sulphuric acid_ is detected by diluting the acid with six parts of\r\ndistilled water, and adding a few drops of the muriate of baryta, which\r\noccasions a white precipitate if any be present. _Iron_, by saturating a\r\ndiluted portion with pure carbonate of soda, and adding prussiate of\r\npotass, which will indicate its presence by a blue precipitate; or by a\r\nsolution of ammonia, which, when added slightly in excess, throws down\r\nthe peroxide of iron of a reddish yellow colour. _Copper_, by the\r\nproduction of a blue colour when supersaturated with ammonia. The yellow\r\ntinge of the acid usually met with in commerce, may depend either upon\r\nthe presence of iron, vegetable extractive, or a small portion of\r\nchlorine. This latter body may be recognised by the odour, or by its\r\npower of dissolving gold leaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ACIDUM NITRICUM. L.E.D. _Nitric Acid._\r\n\r\n                              Aqua Fortis.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. A limpid liquid of the specific gravity 1·500, a fluid-ounce\r\nof which is equal to about 11 drachms, 1 scruple by weight, and ought to\r\ndecompose of pure limestone an ounce; it emits white fumes of a\r\nsuffocating odour. _Taste_, extremely acid; it is highly corrosive, and\r\ntinges the skin indelibly yellow; an effect which is considerably\r\nheightened by the subsequent application of an alkali, so that these\r\nagents afford the means of detecting minute portions of animal matter,\r\nand were ingeniously employed for such an object by Mr. Hatchett.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. When of the specific gravity 1·500, it contains\r\n74·895 per cent. of dry acid; (whose ultimate elements are one portion\r\nof nitrogen and five of oxygen) the compliment 25·105 parts is water. It\r\nis decomposed with violent action by all combustibles, and when mixed\r\nwith volatile oils, it causes their inflammation. It boils at 210°, and\r\nwhen its specific gravity is below 1·4, it is strengthened, when\r\nstronger than 1·45 it is weakened by ebullition. USES. It is principally\r\nemployed as a pharmaceutical agent; _viz._ for the preparation of\r\n_Argenti Nitras_; _Liquor Ferri Alkalini_; _Hydrargyri Nitri-co-oxydum_;\r\n_Spiritus Etheris Nitrici_; and _Unguentum Hydrargyri Nitratis_. As an\r\nescharotic it has been frequently employed for the destruction of\r\ntumours, and is certainly of value where an immediate destruction of\r\ndiseased parts is required. The method of using the strong nitric acid\r\nin such cases is to smear all the sound parts in the immediate vicinity\r\nof the ulcer with _Ung: Resin: Nig:_ and then to apply pledgets of lint\r\nfirmly upon the ulcer for a few seconds, by which the whole surface will\r\nbe deadened, and a deep slough remain, underneath which healthy\r\nsuppuration and granulations will ensue.[352] ADULTERATIONS. _Sulphuric\r\nacid_ may be detected by a precipitate being produced on the addition of\r\nnitrate of baryta; in the application however of this test, Mr. Hume has\r\nshewn that unless this as well as the nitric acid be diluted, a\r\nprecipitate will occur, although sulphuric acid should not be present; a\r\ncircumstance which depends upon the barytic salt yielding its water of\r\nsolution to the acid under examination, and becoming insoluble.\r\n_Muriatic acid_ is discovered by nitrate of silver, affording a\r\nprecipitate at first white, but becoming coloured by exposure to light;\r\nthe nitric acid ought to be perfectly colourless, but to preserve it in\r\nsuch a state it must be closely stopped, and kept in a dark place, or it\r\nwill soon be converted into nitrous acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      ACIDUM NITRICUM DILUTUM.

DOSE ♏︎x to xl. The acid is a very\r\npowerful anti-phlogistic remedy; it has been much extolled in diseases\r\nof the liver, and in syphilis. Mr. Pearson however observes that we\r\nought not to rely upon it in any form of lues venerea, although it may\r\nbe often serviceable in restraining the progress of the disease when an\r\nimpaired constitution or other circumstances render the exhibition of\r\nmercury improper; when sufficiently dilute, it forms an excellent lotion\r\nfor old indolent ulcers. It proves also expectorant, see _Form. 139,\r\n140_; and it is occasionally used with success for the purpose of\r\ncounteracting the consecutive effects of opium. See _Form. 16_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 ACIDUM NITROSUM. E.D. _Nitrous Acid._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. A liquid emitting fumes of a flame-red colour, and of a very\r\npungent and remarkable odour. The acid is either blue, green,\r\nstraw-coloured, clear orange yellow, according to the proportion of\r\nnitrous acid gas[353] with which it is charged. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nThis acid is improperly denominated _Nitrous_, for it is nitric acid,\r\nholding nitrous acid gas loosely combined; by dilution this last\r\nconstituent is disengaged, and the acid, after passing through a\r\nsuccession of different colours, becomes pure nitric acid; the\r\napplication of a gentle heat effects the same changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n               ACIDUM SULPHURICUM. L.E.D. Sulphuric Acid.\r\n\r\n                   _Oil of Vitriol, Vitriolic Acid._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a thick liquid of an oily consistence, specific\r\ngravity 1·85; a fluid-ounce weighs a fraction of a grain more than\r\nfourteen drachms. _Colour_, none, but it acquires a brown tinge from the\r\nsmallest portion of carbonaceous matter; mere exposure to the air is\r\nsufficient for this purpose, in consequence of the acid disorganizing\r\nand carbonating the vegetable and animal matter suspended in the\r\natmosphere; it is therefore evident that bottles in which it is\r\npreserved ought not to have stoppers of cork, but those of glass.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Like the other mineral acids, it has never been\r\nobtained in an insulated state without water; according to Davy, the\r\ncomposition of the strongest acid may be thus expressed: sulphur 30,\r\noxygen 45, water 17. It has a very powerful affinity for water, and\r\nproduces when mixed with it a very considerable heat; exposed to the\r\natmosphere it imbibes at least seven times its own weight of water, and\r\nso rapidly as to double its weight in a month; when of the specific\r\ngravity 1·85, it rises in vapour at about 550°, and distils unaltered,\r\nwhereas weaker acids lose water by being boiled, and are brought to that\r\ndegree of concentration; when diluted with 12 or 13 per cent. of water,\r\nan acid results of the specific gravity 1·780, and in this state of\r\ndilution it boils at 435°, and freezes sooner than water; a knowledge of\r\nthis curious fact suggests to the prudent chemist an important\r\nprecaution; Mr. Parkes, in his Chemical Essays, vol. ii. relates the\r\noccurrence of a terrible accident which happened in consequence of this\r\ncircumstance not having been attended to.—“Carboy after carboy burst by\r\nthe expansion of the acid in the act of freezing, and had not the packed\r\ncarboys that remained been immediately immersed in tepid water, not a\r\nsingle one would have escaped the general wreck.”\r\n\r\nADULTERATIONS. The ordinary acid of the shops contains in general 3 or 4\r\nper cent. of saline matter, which consists of about two-thirds of\r\nsulphate of potass, and one-third of sulphate of lead. Dr. Ure observes,\r\nthat even more is occasionally found, in consequence of the employment\r\nof nitre to remove the brown colour given to the acid by carbonaceous\r\nmatter; the amount of adulteration, he observes, may be readily\r\ndetermined by evaporating a definite weight of the acid in a small\r\ncapsule of platinum; these impurities however in a medical point of view\r\nare immaterial, since they are at once separated by dilution, but in a\r\ncommercial sense they deserve attention, as their presence considerably\r\nincreases the specific gravity of the acid. Dr. Ure is of opinion that\r\ngenuine commercial acid should never exceed 1·8485, and that any density\r\nbeyond this is the effect of saline combination. _Journal of Science and\r\nthe Arts, No. 7._\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ACIDUM SULPHURICUM DILUTUM.

USES. In addition to the\r\nantiseptic and refrigerant virtues which it possesses in common with the\r\nother mineral acids, it has astringent properties that render it a most\r\nvaluable medicine, especially in weakness and relaxation of the\r\ndigestive organs, in colliquative sweats, in internal hæmorrhagy; in\r\nEpistaxis and Hemopthysis it was Sydenham’s favourite remedy; on the\r\nsame account, when sufficiently dilute, it has been successfully used as\r\na collyrium in the atonic stages of ophthalmia, and as an injection in\r\nprotracted gonorrhæa. Dose, ♏︎x to xl, the quantity of strong sulphuric\r\nacid in any given quantity of the dilute may be found by the Dynameter.\r\nTo prevent it from injuring the enamel of the teeth it may be sucked\r\nthrough a quill, and the mouth should be carefully washed after each\r\ndose.

SOLUBILITY. Water at 60° dissolves about one-fifth of its\r\nweight, and when boiling, a much greater proportion. The solution,\r\nwhich, if saturated, has the specific gravity 1·230, acquires, when\r\ndiluted, like that of most vegetable acids, a mouldy pellicle by\r\nkeeping. The saturating power of crystallized tartaric acid is almost\r\nexactly equal to that of crystallized citric acid, the atomic weight of\r\nthe former being 76, and that of the latter 75. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nWhen uncombined with water, as it exists in tartrate of potass, it is\r\ncomposed of 5 atoms of oxygen, 3 atoms of hydrogen, and 4 atoms of\r\ncarbon. The crystals consist of 1 atom of acid and 1 of water.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. Alkalies, Earths, and their carbonates; the\r\nsalts of lime and lead. The solutions of the salts of potass are\r\nconverted by it into bi-tartrate, or super-tartrate. MEDICINAL USES. It\r\nis introduced into the Pharmacopœia as a cheap and efficient substitute\r\nfor the citric acid. It is also used in the preparation of _Sodaic\r\npowders_, _Seidlitz powders_, &c. ADULTERATIONS. When carelessly\r\nprepared it will contain sulphuric acid, to detect which, let a portion\r\nbe dissolved in distilled water, and a solution of acetate of lead be\r\nadded. A precipitate will appear which, if the acid be pure, will be\r\nentirely redissolved by a few drops of acetic acid, or pure nitric acid.\r\nIf any portion remain undissolved, sulphuric acid is the cause. Muriate\r\nof Baryta also, when sulphuric acid is present, but not otherwise, gives\r\na precipitate insoluble by an excess of muriatic acid.\r\n\r\n\r\n      ACONITI FOLIA. L.E.D.

It was first administered in 1702, by Stöerk,\r\nof Vienna, in chronic rheumatism, gout, schirrus, and paralysis; more\r\nlately it has been employed in scrofula, cancer, and intermittents, and\r\nit is said with much effect.

The leaves\r\nare, however, sometimes given in the form of powder, generally combined\r\nwith some mercurial alterative, or with antimonials, camphor, and other\r\ndiaphoretics. DOSE gr. i-x.

It consists of two distinct\r\nbodies which appear to exist together in a state of mechanical mixture,\r\nviz. _Stearin_, (from στεαρ tallow) which is white, brittle, and in\r\nappearance somewhat resembling wax; and _Elain_ (from ελαὶον, oil) very\r\nsimilar to vegetable oil in appearance, and is liquid at 59°. According\r\nto the experiments of Braconnot, the proportion of _Elain_ is to that of\r\n_Stearin_, in hog’s lard, as 62:38. SOLUBILITY.

INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. _Extracts_, _Spirituous Preparations_, _Tinctures_, and\r\n_Infusions_, are incapable of uniting perfectly with lard, without some\r\nintermedium; the following substances on the contrary are capable of\r\ncontracting with it a most intimate union. 1. _All dry powders_, whether\r\nof a vegetable or mineral nature. 2. _Fixed and Volatile Oils._ 3.\r\n_Balsams._ 4. _Camphor._ 5. _Soaps._ It is principally employed in the\r\nformation of ointments, plasters, and liniments.\r\n\r\nÆRUGO. L. D. (Sub-acetas Cupri _Impura._) SUB-ACETIS CUPRI. E.\r\n\r\n_Verdigris._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a dry mass composed of minute crystals, not\r\ndeliquescent; _Colour_, bluish green. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Several\r\nconstituents enter into its composition, viz. Acetate and sub-acetate of\r\ncopper, carbonate of copper, and copper partly metallic and partly\r\noxidized; it contains also the stalks of grapes and other extraneous\r\nsubstances. SOLUBILITY. Boiling water dissolves it in part, and produces\r\nin it a chemical change, by transforming one portion of the\r\n_sub_-acetate into the soluble acetate, and another into an oxyd of\r\ncopper, which is precipitated; with cold water this substance demeans\r\nitself differently, the acetate is dissolved by it, whilst that portion\r\nwhich is in the state of _sub_-salt remains suspended in the form of a\r\nfine green powder. Vinegar converts all the _Ærugo_ into a soluble\r\nacetate, this liquid therefore ought never to be employed for favouring\r\nvomiting in cases where an overdose has been swallowed, for the reasons\r\nstated in the first part of this work, p. 136. Sulphuric acid poured on\r\npowdered _verdigris_ decomposes it with effervescence, and vapours of\r\nacetic acid are disengaged. It appears from the experiments and\r\nobservations of Duval and Orfila, that sugar exercises a chemical action\r\non it, by which its solubility is diminished, and that on this account\r\nit acts as a specific against its poisonous effects. USES. It is so\r\nuncertain and violent in its operation that it is rarely employed,\r\nexcept externally,[358] when it acts as a powerful detergent, and mild\r\nescharotic; and in the form of ointment, is a valuable application for\r\nmany cutaneous affections, especially the aggravated kinds of Tetter.\r\nOFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Ærugo Præparata_, D. _Linimentum Æruginis._ L.\r\nD. ADULTERATIONS. There is a spurious article sold under the name of\r\n_English Verdigris_, which consists of sulphate of copper, triturated\r\nwith acetate of lead; and to make the fraud still more complete, the\r\nsoft mass is mixed with the stalks of Raisins.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ÆTHER SULPHURICUS RECTIFICATUS. L.\r\n\r\n                      _Rectified Sulphuric Æther._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. A colourless liquid of specific gravity 739°. _Odour_,\r\npungent and fragrant; it is highly volatile, and when perfectly free\r\nfrom alcohol it boils at 98°; it is extremely inflammable, a\r\ncircumstance which should be remembered when it is poured from one\r\nvessel to another by candle light. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. When pure it\r\nconsists of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon; the rectified æther however\r\nstill contains some water and alcohol, for Lovitz obtained an æther of\r\n632. SOLUBILITY. One part requires for its solution ten of water; with\r\nalcohol and ammonia it unites in every proportion. SOLVENT POWERS. It is\r\none of the most powerful solvents known in vegetable chemistry, as it\r\ndissolves balsams, resins, gum-resins, wax, camphor, extractive, &c.; it\r\ntakes up about a twentieth of its weight of sulphur, but it exerts no\r\nsolvent power upon the fixed alkalies. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In any\r\nliquid vehicle, if in decoctions or infusions, they should be previously\r\ncooled. _See Formulæ 20, 22, 23_. MEDICAL USES. It is highly valuable as\r\na diffusible stimulant, narcotic, and antispasmodic. DOSE, fʒss to fʒij,\r\nwhich, in order to produce the full effect of the remedy, must be\r\nrepeated at short intervals. Æther, independent of such virtues, has\r\nanother valuable property consequent upon its rapid evaporation, that of\r\nproducing cold and dryness; it is therefore, when externally applied and\r\nallowed to evaporate, a most powerful refrigerant, and has proved\r\nvaluable in scalds or burns, in facilitating the reduction of\r\nstrangulated hernia, and in diminishing excessive circulation in the\r\nbrain; if however it be so confined, that its rapid evaporation is\r\nprevented, a very opposite effect is produced, and it proves stimulant,\r\nrubefacient, and even vesicatory. With regard to the other property\r\nincidental to it, that of producing dryness, I am not aware that it has\r\nhitherto been applied to any pharmaceutical purpose; the fact may be\r\nsatisfactorily shewn by a very simple experiment,—by rincing a phial\r\nwith æther, to the interior of which drops of water obstinately adhere,\r\nwhen by exposing it to a current of air, it will be completely dry in a\r\nfew minutes. It may be noticed in this place that a mixture of sulphuric\r\nand muriatic æthers evaporates instantaneously, and produces a degree of\r\ncold considerably below 0 of Fahrenheit.

Its specific gravity affords\r\nthe best indication of its purity; _Sulphuric Acid_ may be detected by a\r\nprecipitation on the addition of a solution of baryta, and by its\r\nreddening the colour of litmus; _Alcohol_, by its forming with\r\nphosphorus a milky instead of a limpid solution. M. Gay Lussac has\r\nobserved that when kept for a considerable time without disturbance, it\r\nundergoes spontaneous decomposition, and that acetic acid, perhaps some\r\nalcohol, and a particular oil, are produced from it.\r\n\r\n\r\n              ALCOHOL.[359] L.D. _Alcohol. Ardent Spirit._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. A transparent, and colourless liquid of the specific gravity\r\n·815; it has not hitherto been rendered solid by any diminution of\r\ntemperature; it boils at 176°, and if water be added, its boiling point\r\nis proportionably raised; hence, says Dr. Henry, the temperature at\r\nwhich it boils is not a bad test of its strength; it is combustible, and\r\nburns with a blue flame, leaving no residue. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nAlcohol, in a state of complete purity, consists of carbon, hydrogen,\r\nand oxygen, in proportions not hitherto determined with accuracy; this\r\npreparation however contains 7 per cent. of water; Lovitz and Saussure\r\nsucceeded in obtaining it at a specific gravity of ·791, which may be\r\nconsidered as nearly pure. Alcohol unites chemically with water; and\r\ncaloric is evolved during this union; the quantity of alcohol and water\r\nin mixtures of different specific gravities, may be learned from Mr.\r\nGilpin’s tables, _Philosophical Transactions_, 1794, or _Nicholson’s\r\nJournal_, _4to. vol._ 1. The Edinburgh Pharmacopœia has no process for\r\nthe preparation of alcohol, but it most incorrectly assigns the title to\r\nthat which is the “Rectified Spirit” of the other Colleges. SOLVENT\r\nPOWERS. Alcohol dissolves soap; vegetable extract; sugar; oxalic,\r\ncamphoric, tartaric, gallic, and benzoic acids; volatile oils; resins,\r\nand balsams; it combines also with sulphur, and the pure fixed alkalies,\r\nbut not with their carbonates: for its other habitudes, and\r\napplications, see _Spiritus Rectificatus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  ALLII RADIX. L.E.D. Allium Sativum.\r\n\r\n                             _Garlic._[360]\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This bulbous root has when recent a fœtid smell, and acrid\r\ntaste, which are extracted by watery infusion; by decoction they are\r\nnearly lost; by expression, the root furnishes almost one-fourth of its\r\nweight of a limpid juice, and by distillation, an odorous, acrid,\r\nessential oil is procured, in which the existence of sulphur may be\r\ndetected. Garlic has a considerable analogy to squill and onion, and\r\nlike them, exerts a diuretic, diaphoretic, expectorant, and stimulant\r\noperation; (see p. 103). It is a very common domestic remedy for the\r\nexpulsion of tænia, and it is undoubtedly of advantage in such cases; it\r\nis usually administered in the form of a decoction, with milk, on an\r\nempty stomach; it is however but rarely used in modern practice, as it\r\npossesses no superiority over remedies less nauseous and objectionable;\r\nthe bruised root, externally applied, is highly stimulant, and\r\nrubefacient. Sydenham speaks highly of the application of garlic to the\r\nsoles of the feet, as a powerful means of producing revulsion from the\r\nhead. OFFICINAL PREPARATION. _Syrupus Allii._ D.[361]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       ALOES EXTRACTUM. _Aloes._\r\n\r\nThere are three species met with in the shops, viz.\r\n\r\n 1. ALÖE SPICATA, L. Socotorina, D.           Socrotrine Aloes.\r\n      PERFOLIATA. E.                          Cape Aloes.\r\n 2. ALÖE VULGARIS.[362] L. Hepatica, E. D.    Common or Barbadoes Aloes.\r\n 3. ALÖE CABALINA. Fetid, Cabaline, or Horse  Employed only by Farriers.\r\n      Aloes.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. The above varieties of aloe differ in their purity, and\r\nlikewise in their sensible qualities; the _Socotrine_ is the purest, it\r\nis in small pieces of a reddish brown colour; the _Barbadoes_ is in\r\nlarge masses, of a lighter colour, and having an odour much stronger and\r\nless pleasant; the _Cabaline_ is still more impure and less powerful.\r\nAll the kinds are characterized by an intensely bitter taste, which, in\r\nthe _Socotrine_, is accompanied by an aromatic flavour. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. In this there appears to be some obscurity; M. Braconnot\r\n(_Ann. Chim. tom. 68._) conceives it to be a substance, _sui generis_,\r\nwhich he terms “_bitter resin_,” while others regard it as composed of\r\nresin, gum, and extractive, the proportions of which are supposed to\r\nvary in the different species, but that their peculiar virtues reside in\r\nthe extractive part. SOLUBILITY. It is to the slowness with which aloe\r\nundergoes solution in the _primæ viæ_, that it is indebted for the\r\nmedicinal properties which distinguish this substance; by boiling water\r\nit is dissolved, but on cooling a precipitation ensues, and by long\r\ndecoction it becomes quite inert; weak acids dissolve it more abundantly\r\nthan water, but proof spirit is the most perfect solvent: its solubility\r\nis increased by the addition of alkaline salts and soaps, but by such a\r\ncombination it undergoes a material change in its medicinal properties;\r\nthe bitterness is diminished, its purgative effects impaired, and it\r\nceases to operate specifically upon the large intestines, a fact so far\r\nvaluable, as it enables us in certain cases to obviate its irritating\r\naction upon the rectum. MEDICINAL USE. Aloe is a bitter stimulating\r\npurgative, emptying the large intestines, without making the stools\r\nthin; it likewise warms the habit, quickens the circulation, and\r\npromotes the uterine and hemorrhoidal fluxes. DOSE, gr. v.–xv. No\r\ngreater effect is produced by a large dose than from one comparatively\r\nmoderate; its tendency, however, to irritate the rectum renders it, in\r\nmany cases, an objectionable remedy;[363] and its sympathetic action on\r\nthe uterus may occasionally produce mischief, in irritable habits, while\r\nin other states it may, for reasons equally obvious, prove beneficial.\r\nFORMS OF EXHIBITION. The form of pill should be preferred on account of\r\nits extreme bitterness, as well as being, for the reasons above\r\nmentioned, the one most likely to fulfil the intention of its\r\nexhibition; for in addition to what has been stated in a preceding part\r\nof this work, on the important influence of solubility, it may be here\r\nobserved that since the aloe does not undergo solution in the stomach,\r\nit is admirably adapted for the basis of remedies intended to obviate\r\nconstitutional costiveness, for in our endeavours to supply the\r\ndeficiencies of nature by the resources of art, we should at least\r\nattempt to imitate the modes of her operation; the natural stimulus of\r\nthe intestines, the bile, is poured into them below the stomach, and\r\nwhenever it regurgitates into that organ it produces disease; so it\r\nhappens with our cathartic medicines, and unless we so modify their\r\nsolubility that their operation cannot commence until after their\r\npassage through the stomach, we shall find that we only increase the\r\nevil we are endeavouring to obviate, and that, in addition to the torpor\r\nof the intestinal canal, we shall induce the stomach to participate in\r\nthe disease, or excite a morbid fretfulness of that organ which will be\r\nattended with the most distressing symptoms.[364] _See Formulæ_ 12, 13,\r\n79, 80, 81. Aloes in combination with assafœtida furnishes an eligible\r\npurgative in the dyspepsia of old persons; it is also well calculated to\r\nobviate the costiveness so generally produced by Opium, (_Form:_ 11, 12,\r\n13.)

It\r\nis frequently adulterated with common resin, but the fraud more\r\ngenerally committed is that of mixing with, or substituting the inferior\r\nspecies for the Socotrine, but the _Barbadoes Aloes_ may, independent of\r\nits want of aromatic flavour, be distinguished from the Socotrine by a\r\nsimple test, for the latter dissolves entirely in boiling water and\r\nalcohol, whereas the former, when treated in a similar manner, leaves a\r\nconsiderable residue; sometimes the _Horse Aloes_ is made to appear so\r\nbright and pure, as not to be easily distinguished by the eye even from\r\nthe _Socotrine_, but its rank odour, of which no art can divest it, will\r\nreadily betray the fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n   ALUMEN. (_Super-sulphas Aluminæ et Potassæ._) Sulphas Aluminæ. E.\r\n\r\n                           Alumen. D. _Alum._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, octohedral crystals, whose sides are equilateral\r\ntriangles; they are slightly efflorescent. _Taste_, sweet, rough, and\r\nacidulous. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a triple, or sometimes a\r\nquadruple salt, with excess of acid, consisting of sulphuric acid and\r\nalumina, with potass, or ammonia, or frequently both of them; the nature\r\nof the alkali however does not in the least appear to affect the\r\nproperties of alum, although it produces a crystallographic\r\nmodification; for where potass is present the summit of the crystal will\r\nexhibit a truncation. Dr. Ure has lately produced alum with soda, and\r\nthe combination differs from common alum only in its greater degree of\r\nsolubility, a property which at once recommends it to the attention of\r\nthe pharmaceutist and physician. SOLUBILITY. A fluid-ounce of cold water\r\ndissolves 30 grains, but if boiling four drachms; it is insoluble in\r\nalcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ and _alkaline salts_, after\r\nneutralizing the excess of acid, precipitate the alumine. It is also\r\ndecomposed by _carbonate_ and _muriate of ammonia_, _carbonate of\r\nmagnesia_, and _tartrate of potass_, by _lime-water_, _acetate of lead_,\r\nand _the salts of mercury_, as well as by many vegetable and animal\r\nsubstances, especially _galls_ and _kino_. It is on this account very\r\ninjudicious to combine alum with any vegetable astringent with a view to\r\nencrease its virtues; thus the “_Pulvis Sulphatis Aluminæ compositus_”\r\nof the Edinburgh college, is less powerful than any of the ingredients\r\nof which it is composed; and the addition of alum to the decoction of\r\nbark, undoubtedly diminishes its efficacy as an astringent injection.\r\nMEDICINAL USES. Alum is internally a powerful astringent, in hæmorrhages\r\nand inordinate fluxes, and is externally useful for repellent and\r\nastringent lotions, gargles, and collyria. Dioscorides and Hippocrates\r\npraised its effects as a lotion in various kinds of ulcers, and\r\nparticularly in sores of the mouth, and in spongy, swelled gums.\r\nVan-Helmont was the first person who employed alum in uterine\r\nhemorrhage, and the success of the practice very considerably enhanced\r\nhis reputation. _Boerhaave’s_ astringent powder for the ague consisted\r\nof _Alum_ and _Nutmeg_ with the addition of _Armenian bole_. DOSE, gr.\r\nx. In large doses it is liable to excite nausea, and to act upon the\r\nbowels. Nutmeg or some aromatic should therefore be joined with it.\r\nFORMS OF EXHIBITION. In solution, or in substance made into pills with\r\nextract; (_Form: 53, 56_,) it is sometimes given with advantage in the\r\nform of whey (_Alum-whey—Serum Aluminosum_) made by boiling ʒij with a\r\npint of milk, and then straining, the dose of which is a wine glass\r\nfull; (_Form; 54._) By briskly agitating a drachm of alum with the white\r\nof an egg, a coagulum is formed, (_Alum curd of Riverius_; _Albumen.\r\nAluminosum_) which is serviceable in some species of ophthalmia, when\r\napplied between two pieces of thin linen rag.[365] As alum is not\r\ndecomposed by sulphate of lime, hard water may be safely used for its\r\nsolution. It has the effect of retarding, and in some instances of\r\npreventing, the acetous fermentation in vegetables; thus when added to\r\ncommon _paste_ it prevents its becoming sour; animal substances, as\r\n_glue_, are preserved by it in a similar manner. It has also the\r\nproperty of clearing turbid water, wine, and spirituous liquors, for\r\nwhich purpose it is extensively employed. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS.\r\n_Liquor Alum: co._ L. _Pulv: Alum: co._ E.\r\n\r\nALUMEN EXSICCATUM, L. Ustum. D. _Dried Alum._ By the action of heat alum\r\nundergoes watery fusion, yields its water of crystallization, and loses\r\nmore than one third of its weight; if the heat be too intense, or long\r\ncontinued, it is deprived of a great part of its acid. It has been\r\nrecommended in doses of a scruple, in cholic, when it has been said to\r\noperate gently upon the bowels, and to relieve the pain: I have myself\r\nexperienced this good effect when the cholic has been produced by the\r\naction of lead: Dr. Grashuis, a Dutch Physician, first recommended its\r\nuse in Cholica Pictonum. The preparation however is principally used as\r\nan external application, having a degree of escharotic power, which\r\nrenders it serviceable in venereal chancres, as well as in other ulcers\r\nhaving weak and spongy granulations; it is also very frequently employed\r\nto destroy fungous excrescencies, but it should be remembered that, as\r\nit owes such power to an excess of acid, unless it be carefully\r\nprepared, it must be inefficient. It ought to redden syrup of violets.\r\n\r\nALUMEN RUPEUM. _Roche_ or _Rock Alum_. This variety was originally\r\nbrought from Roccha, formerly called Edessa, in Syria, in fragments of\r\nabout the size of an almond, covered with an efflorescence of a pale\r\nrose colour; that however which is now sold under this name is common\r\nEnglish alum, artificially coloured. It is unimportant.\r\n\r\nALUMEN ROMANUM. _Roman Alum_ is in irregular octohedral masses, powdery\r\non the surface; it is the purest kind, and contains no ammonia in its\r\ncomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n              AMMONIACUM.

(_Heracleum Gummiferum._)\r\n\r\n                               Ammoniac.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, masses composed of fragments, of tears, yellow on the\r\nsurface, and white within; _Taste_, a nauseous sweet, followed by a\r\nbitter flavour; _Odour_, faint but not unpleasant. _Specific gravity_,\r\n1·200. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gum-resin, gluten, and some volatile\r\nmatter. SOLUBILITY. It is partly soluble in water, vinegar, alcohol,\r\næther, and in the solutions of the alkalies; when triturated with water\r\na milky liquor is formed, which is a solution of gum holding the resin\r\nin suspension, and if the yolk of an egg be employed the mixture is more\r\npermanent; water appears to be its proper solvent. USES. Stimulant,\r\nantispasmodic, and expectorant: in large doses gently purgative and\r\nsometimes diuretic; after the exhibition of smart purgatives, in\r\ncombination with rhubarb, it proves valuable in mesenteric affections by\r\ncorrecting the viscid secretion of the intestines; dissolved in nitric\r\nacid, it is said to prove an excellent expectorant in cases where large\r\naccumulations of purulent or viscid matter exist with feeble and\r\ndifficult expectoration. See _Form: 140_. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In\r\nsolution, see _Mist: Ammoniac:_ it may also be given when dissolved in\r\nthe _Liquor ammoniæ acetatis_; ʒij of the former may be dissolved in\r\n℥iij of the latter; or it may be exhibited in pills with bitter\r\nextracts, myrrh, and other gum-resins; if rubbed with camphor a mass is\r\nat once produced very suitable for pills; vinegar renders it soft, and\r\nadapts it for plasters.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nIt will be found to vary materially in its composition according to the\r\ntemperature employed for its preparation; the quantity of alkali varying\r\nfrom 20 to 50 per cent. Mr. Phillips considers the _Sub_-carbonate of\r\nammonia to be a _Sesque_-carbonate, composed of 3 atoms of carbonic\r\nacid, 2 atoms of ammonia, and 2 of water; or that it is a definite\r\ncompound of _Carbonate_ and _Bi-carbonate_, one atom of each, with two\r\natoms of water; one hundred parts, by experiment, consist, of 54·2\r\n_carb: acid_, 29·3 _Ammonia_, and 16·5 _water_; if we consider it as a\r\n_Sesque-carbonate_, its constitution, according to Dr. Wollaston’s\r\nscale, will be 55·72 _Carbonic Acid_, 29 _Ammonia_, 15·28 _water_.\r\nSOLUBILITY. According to Duncan it is soluble in twice its weight of\r\ncold water; Mr. Phillips states four times; the mean of these will be\r\nfound nearly correct. Its solubility however is increased by increase of\r\ntemperature, but when dissolved in boiling water it effervesces, and\r\nundergoes a partial decomposition; it is quite insoluble in alcohol, and\r\nhence on the addition of spirit to a strong solution, a dense coagulum\r\nis produced. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. It is decomposed by _acids_,\r\n_fixed alkalies_, and their _sub-carbonates_, _lime_, _solution of\r\nmuriate of lime_, _magnesia_, _alum_, _super-tartrate of potass_, and\r\nall the _acidulous salts_, _sulphate of magnesia_, _acetate_,\r\n_sub-muriate_, and _oxy-muriate of mercury_, _acetate_, and _sub-acetate\r\nof lead_, and the _sulphates of iron and zinc_. If it be added to\r\ndecoctions and infusions they must be previously cooled. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. Since by exposure to air its virtues are impaired, it ought\r\nnot to be kept in powdered mixtures; in the form of pill it is preserved\r\nmuch longer, especially if it be combined with some vegetable extract.\r\nUSES. It is stimulant, antispasmodic, diaphoretic, powerfully antacid,\r\nexceeding in this respect the fixed alkalies, and in large doses it is\r\nemetic. It is highly useful as a stimulant in those gastric affections\r\nwhich supervene habits of irregularity and debauchery; combined with\r\nopium it affords a powerful resource in protracted diarrhœa attended\r\nwith debility of the alimentary canal: and in cases of muscular atony so\r\nfrequently witnessed, as the _sequela_ of chronic rheumatism, ammonia,\r\nin large doses, offers the best remedy; I have moreover witnessed the\r\nbeneficial effects of this remedy in hoarseness depending upon relaxed\r\nstates of the throat. In typhus fever it has been particularly\r\nrecommended by Huxham, Pringle, and many other physicians, and some have\r\nconsidered it superior to any other stimulant upon such occasions. It is\r\nalso useful in syncope and hysteria, in the form of smelling salts;[366]\r\nwith respect to its application for making saline draughts, see _Acid:\r\nCitricum:_ DOSE, grs v to ℈j: to produce emesis ʒss.

CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. In consequence of the present unsettled opinions respecting\r\nthe nature of muriatic acid and ammonia, and the changes which they\r\nundergo by combination with each other, the composition of this salt is\r\ninvolved in some obscurity. According to Dr. Thomson, it consists of\r\nequal volumes of muriatic acid gas and ammoniacal gas, although he has\r\nsubsequently observed that from the peculiar properties of the\r\nsubstance, it may be a compound of _Chlorine_ and _Ammonium_ (the\r\nhypothetical base of ammonia.) Unlike all the other ammoniacal salts, it\r\ndoes not undergo decomposition by heat. SOLUBILITY, f℥j of water at 66°\r\ndissolves about two drachms and a half; at 212° it dissolves its own\r\nweight; it is also soluble in 4½ parts of alcohol; its solution in water\r\nis accompanied by considerable reduction of temperature. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. The sulphuric and nitric acids unite with the ammonia, and\r\ndisengage the muriatic acid, whilst ammonia is disengaged by the action\r\nof potass and its carbonate, carbonate of soda, lime, magnesia, &c.\r\nwhich combine with its muriatic acid; with oxy-muriate of mercury it\r\ncombines and increases its solubility, see _Hydrarg: Oxy-murias_. When\r\nunited with acetate of lead, it decomposes it, and a muriate of lead is\r\nprecipitated. It is obvious also that nitrate of silver, and all the\r\nmetallic salts whose bases form insoluble compounds with muriatic acid,\r\nare incompatible with it. USES. Rarely employed as an internal remedy,\r\nexternally it is employed in lotions, either for the cold produced\r\nduring its solution, in which case it should be applied as soon as the\r\nsalt is dissolved, or for the stimulus of the salt, on which principle\r\nit acts as a powerful discutient in indolent tumours (_Form. 146._) It\r\nis also an ingredient in a very useful plaster, in which it undergoes\r\nchemical decomposition; this plaster consists of _Soap_ ℥j, _lead\r\nplaster_, ʒij, liquified together, to which, when nearly cold, are added\r\nof _muriate of ammonia_ finely powdered ʒss. The alkali of the soap\r\nenters into combination with the muriatic acid of the muriate of\r\nammonia, and forms thereby muriate of potass, or soda, and ammoniacal\r\ngas (on which the virtue of the plaster depends) is slowly but\r\nabundantly liberated, acting as a powerful stimulant and rubefacient: it\r\nshould be applied immediately after it is formed, and be renewed every\r\ntwenty-four hours, otherwise the intention is lost; (_Pharmacopœia\r\nChirurgica._) I have often applied this plaster with evident advantage\r\nto the chest in pulmonary affections, and I wish to recommend it to the\r\nattention of practitioners. It is very useful also in that rheumatic\r\naffection of the muscles of the chest, which is so frequently met with\r\nin persons in advanced life; during the last winter I was consulted in\r\ntwo cases where the distress after exercise was so considerable as to\r\nresemble angina pectoris.

The _sweet almond_ is inodorous, and has a sweet, bland\r\ntaste; the _bitter almond_,[368] when triturated with water, has the\r\nodour of the peach, and a pleasant bitter flavour. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nBoullay has lately confirmed the analogy which Proust had stated to\r\nexist between the emulsion of sweet almonds and human milk, viz. the\r\nformer consists of sweet oil 54, albumen 24, sugar 6, gum 3, with traces\r\nof acetic acid; the indigestible property of the almond depends upon its\r\nalbuminous matter. The _bitter almond_, in addition to those\r\nconstituents, contains hydro-cyanic acid, (Prussic acid,) in union with\r\na peculiar volatile oil, upon which its narcotic properties depend; but\r\nthis deleterious element is so modified by the natural state of\r\ncombination in which it exists with sweet oil and albumen, that they may\r\nbe eaten without inconvenience. The bitter almond has long been regarded\r\nas an antidote to drunkenness; Plutarch states it as a fact on the\r\nauthority of his physician Claudius. Other bitters were however supposed\r\nto possess similar powers in this respect, hence the _Poculum\r\nAbsinthiatum_ to which we have before alluded. See page 79. Both sorts\r\nof almonds yield by expression a large quantity of fixed oil, which is\r\nperfectly mild. See _Oleum Amygdal_. The water distilled from the bitter\r\nalmond, when strongly impregnated, has been found to exert a deleterious\r\naction on the human body, and to prove fatal to many animals.\r\nSOLUBILITY. By trituration with water a milky mixture is produced, (_an\r\nemulsion_), for which purpose the sweet almonds should be previously\r\nfreed from their cuticle, (_blanched_), and this ought to be performed\r\nby infusing them in tepid water; for when hot it separates a portion of\r\ntheir oil, as is evident from their being thus rendered yellow, and the\r\nemulsion is therefore more liable to ferment, and be decomposed. ℥ij of\r\nalmonds saturate about f℥vj of water; since however this extemporaneous\r\npreparation is tedious and inconvenient, the London Pharmacopœia very\r\njudiciously directs a confection to be ready prepared, ʒj of which, when\r\ntriturated with f℥j of water, immediately forms an elegant emulsion. See\r\n_Mistura Amygdal_. Almonds form a useful intermedium for suspending in\r\nwater many substances which are of themselves not miscible with it, as\r\ncamphor, and several of the gum-resins; they also assist in the\r\npulverization of refractory substances, as Ipecacuan, &c.

L.E.D. _Starch._ (Triticum Hybernum _Amylum._[370])\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, white columnar masses; _Odour_ and _Taste_, none.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Fecula is one of the proximate principles of\r\nvegetable matter, and _Starch_ is the fecula of wheat.[371] SOLUBILITY.\r\nIt is soluble in boiling water, forming with it a semi-transparent,\r\ninsipid, inodorous, and gelatinous paste, very susceptible of\r\nmouldiness, but which is retarded by the addition of alum; it is\r\ninsoluble, but falls to powder in cold water; nor is it dissolved by\r\nalcohol or ether; although potass dissolves starch, yet the solution of\r\nit is not disturbed by potass, carbonate of potass, nor ammonia, but an\r\nalcoholic solution of potass produces a precipitate; acetate of lead,\r\nand infusion of galls occasion also precipitates. Starch is susceptible\r\nof several interesting and important changes; thus, if it be exposed to\r\nheat until its colour becomes yellow, its properties are so far altered\r\nthat it is no longer insoluble in cold water; and according to the\r\nexperiments of Saussure, if it be mixed with water, a spontaneous\r\ndecomposition takes place, and a quantity of sugar is formed, amounting\r\nin weight to one half of the starch employed, in addition to which a\r\npeculiar gummy matter results, and a substance intermediate between gum\r\nand starch, to which the name of _Amidine_ has been given. Starch\r\nmoreover is convertible into saccharine matter by the agency of\r\nsulphuric acid. USES. Being demulcent it is generally employed as a\r\nvehicle for the exhibition of opium in the form of enema. The ordinary\r\nblue starch is coloured by a solution of smalt and alum, and is unfit\r\nfor medicinal use; formerly it was tinged yellow with saffron or\r\nturmeric, but this went out of fashion on the execution of the famous\r\nmidwife Mrs. Collier, who was hanged in a ruff starched with that\r\ncolour.

Iodine may therefore be employed\r\nfor ascertaining the goodness of starch, a test which is very important,\r\nfor much of what is sold under the name of starch, does not possess its\r\npeculiar characters; it ought however to be stated, that the blue\r\nindication is prevented from taking place by a variety of different\r\nbodies, as _Arsenious acid_, _corrosive sublimate of mercury_, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ANETHI SEMINA.

This article appears in the market in conical loaves, which\r\nare dark grey externally, but internally possess a bladed structure and\r\nconsiderable brilliancy; the Edinburgh and Dublin colleges direct this\r\nsubstance to be levigated with water, and kept in the state of powder;\r\nit should however never be purchased in that form, as it is not\r\nunfrequently adulterated with sulphuret of lead, whereas it cannot\r\ncontain such admixture when its form is characteristically crystalline\r\nand bladed. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Antimony 100, Sulphur 35·572. From the\r\ntime of Basil Valentine to the present, this preparation has been known\r\nin the market by the name of _Antimony_, a name which it is evident can\r\nonly with propriety be applied to the pure metal. SOLUBILITY. It is\r\ninsoluble in water and alcohol; since however it is slightly acted upon\r\nby vegetable acids, cups were formerly made of it, which imparted to\r\nwine that stood in them for some time, an emetic quality.[374] USES. It\r\nis principally employed for the preparation of the other antimonial\r\ncombinations, for which purpose it is more eligible than the metal\r\nitself, as being less contaminated with metallic impurities. Its\r\nmedicinal energies depend altogether upon the state of the stomach, and\r\nmust therefore be extremely uncertain; when it meets with any acid in\r\nthe stomach, it acts with extreme violence, a circumstance which\r\nrequires precaution. It was formerly much more employed as an Alterative\r\nthan at present. Stoll recommends its use in chronic rheumatism, and\r\nadvises its union with Myrrh. In the treatment of affections of the skin\r\nit has been long used, both singly, and in union with other substances,\r\nsuch as _Conium_, _Dulcamara_, _Guaiacum_, &c. In Scrophulous diseases,\r\nconnected with cutaneous eruptions, or ulcerations, it has been a\r\nfavourite remedy with many practitioners, and it forms the basis of\r\nseveral foreign _Nostrums_. In times of remote antiquity it was used by\r\nfemales as a black pigment for staining the eye-lashes, a custom which\r\ncontinues to this day in the east.[375] It is at present given to horses\r\nmixed with their food, to make their coats smooth, and very large doses\r\nmay be given to these animals without producing any deleterious effects.\r\nOFFICINAL PREPARATIONS.

Very complicated\r\nattractions are exerted during the preparation of this substance; the\r\nresult of which is an hydro-sulphuret of Oxide of Antimony, with excess\r\nof sulphur. SOLUBILITY. It is quite insoluble in water. USES. According\r\nto the dose, it is diaphoretic, cathartic, or emetic; it is, however,\r\nless certain than many other preparations, and, unless in combination\r\nwith mercury, for cutaneous affections, is not very often employed.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. All acids and acidulous salts increase its\r\nemetic properties; when therefore acid is suspected to prevail in the\r\nprimæ viæ, it should be combined with soap, magnesia, (_Form: 128_,) or\r\naromatic confection; on the contrary, the confection of roses, and\r\nvehicles containing acids, should be carefully avoided.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. This is involved in much doubt and\r\nobscurity; it is stated in the various dispensatories to be a triple\r\nsalt, consisting of tartaric acid, oxide of antimony,[378] and potass,\r\nand which therefore, says Mr. Thomson, on the principles of the reformed\r\nnomenclature, ought to be termed a _tartrate of antimony and potass_.\r\nThe truth of these views, however, is extremely questionable. I am\r\ninclined to believe with Gay Lussac, that in the various metalline\r\ncompounds, of which super-tartrate of potass is an ingredient, this\r\nlatter substance acts the part of a simple acid; an opinion which\r\nreceives much support from the great solvent property of cream of\r\ntartar, and from the striking fact that it is even capable of dissolving\r\nvarious oxides which are insoluble in tartaric acid, of which the\r\nprotoxide of antimony is an example. According then to this view, tartar\r\nemetic is a salt composed of bi-tartrate (_super-tartrate_) of potass,\r\nwhich acts the part of an acid, and protoxide of antimony: from the\r\nexperiments of Mr. Phillips, it would appear that 100 parts of the\r\nbi-tartrate will dissolve 70 of the protoxide. In this state of doubt it\r\nmust be admitted that no name can be more appropriate than _Antimonium\r\nTartarizatum_, and the London College have therefore properly\r\ndisregarded the suggestions which have been offered for changing its\r\nname. SOLUBILITY. Much discrepancy of opinion exists upon this subject,\r\nowing probably to the variations and incidental impurities to which the\r\nsalt is liable. Dr. Duncan, who selected very pure specimens for\r\nexamination, states that it is soluble in three times its weight of\r\nwater at 212°, and in fifteen at 60°. This solution, when the salt is\r\npure, is perfectly clear and transparent, but if long kept, unless a\r\nportion of spirit be added, it undergoes decomposition; a precipitate\r\nindeed sometimes takes place very rapidly, but this is generally\r\ntartrate of lime, an incidental impurity, derived from the\r\nsuper-tartrate of potass. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Mineral Acids,\r\nAlkalies, and their Carbonates, most of the Metals, Soaps,\r\nHydro-Sulphurets, and many infusions and decoctions of bitter and\r\nastringent Vegetables_, e. g. f℥j. of the decoction of yellow bark is\r\ncapable of completely decomposing ℈j of this salt, and of rendering it\r\ninert.[379] Berthollet has accordingly recommended the immediate\r\nexhibition of this decoction when an overdose of the salt has been\r\ntaken; and Orfila has given a very satisfactory case in which this\r\nantidote succeeded. Infusion and tincture of galls throw down curdled\r\nand inert precipitates of a dirty white colour, inclining to yellow.\r\nRhubarb is equally incompatible: the extract of this substance therefore\r\nnever ought to be employed in forming pills of tartar emetic: but it\r\ndeserves notice that this salt is not decomposed by the infusions of\r\ngentian or wormwood. The _Alkaline Sulphates_, provided they be\r\nperfectly neutral, produce no disturbance in solutions of _tartar\r\nemetic_, and therefore cannot be considered incompatible with them; if\r\nthere be any excess of acid, as in _alum_, _bi-sulphate of potass_, &c.\r\nthen its decomposition is effected, and a white insoluble sulphate of\r\nantimony is precipitated. It appears therefore that the famous\r\n“Emeto-purgative” of the French school, consisting of sulphate of soda,\r\nand tartarized antimony in solution, is by no means the unchemical\r\nmixture which some have considered it to be, and that it really produces\r\nits effects from the operation of its original ingredients, and not from\r\nthat of the compounds (_Sulphate of Antimony, Tartrate of Soda, and\r\nSulphate of Potass_) which have been erroneously supposed to result.\r\nFORMS OF EXHIBITION. Solution is its best form, see _Liquor Antimonii\r\nTartarizati_. DOSE. It either vomits, purges, or sweats, according to\r\nthe quantity exhibited; thus gr. 1/4 will, if the skin be kept warm,\r\npromote a diaphoresis; gr. ½ will procure some stools first, and\r\nsweating afterwards; and gr. j will generally vomit and then purge, and\r\nlastly sweat the patient; in very minute doses, as gr. 1/10 or 1/12\r\ncombined with squill and ammoniacum, it acts as an expectorant, see\r\n_Formulæ 1, 2, 3, 8, 60_. It is decidedly the most manageable, and the\r\nleast uncertain of all the antimonial preparations, and the practitioner\r\nwould probably have but little to regret, were all the other\r\ncombinations of this metal discarded from our pharmacopœias. Some\r\nauthors have considered this substance as possessing sedative powers,\r\nindependent of its nauseating and diaphoretic effects. It undoubtedly\r\nacts upon the heart, and controls the force of the circulation in\r\nfevers, without occasioning any other sensible effect. Mr. Brodie, after\r\nhaving given large doses of this salt to animals, found that the heart\r\nbeat very feebly, and although artificial respiration was kept up, it\r\nsoon ceased to act altogether. Lenthois of Montpellier advises small\r\ndoses of it in incipient phthisis, and it would on some occasions appear\r\nto diminish the febrile excitement. The following is the form in which\r\nDr. Lenthois recommends it to be exhibited upon such occasions. He\r\ndirects a grain of Tartarized Antimony to be dissolved in eight table\r\nspoonsful of distilled water, which are to be added to six or eight\r\npints of water, and to be taken as common drink. Tartar emetic, when\r\ntriturated with lard, in the proportion of ʒiss or ʒij to ℥j of the\r\nlatter, forms a very powerful rubefacient, occasioning a pustular\r\neruption on the skin, and proving very serviceable in deep-seated\r\ninflammation; or the application may be made by dusting a piece of\r\nadhesive plaster with tartarized antimony, taking care to leave a margin\r\nuntouched that it may more firmly adhere. Dr. Jenner, in a late Essay on\r\nthe influence of artificial eruptions on certain diseases, recommends\r\nthe following formula for such a purpose.—℞. _Antimonii Tartarizati_\r\n(_in pulverem subtilem trit._) ʒij—_Unguenti Cetacei_ ʒix;—_Sacchari\r\nalbi_[380] ʒj;—_Hydrargyri Sulphureti Rubri_ gr. v. M. ut fiat\r\nUnguentum. The Pustules which are produced by the inunction have been\r\ngenerally compared to variolous pustules, they are, however, in general\r\nmuch smaller, not so red at the base, nor so tense and white when fully\r\nsuppurated. They are very painful. In Hooping cough, frictions with this\r\nointment upon the region of the stomach have been greatly extolled. By\r\nthis application, says Dr. Jenner, we can not only create vesicles, but\r\nwe can do more,—we have at our command an application which will at the\r\nsame time both vesicate and produce diseased action on the skin itself,\r\nby deeply deranging its structure beneath the surface. This is probably\r\none cause why the sympathetic affection excited by the use of\r\nCantharides, and those changes produced by Tartar Emetic are very\r\ndifferent. The eruption should be kept up for some time, either by the\r\nre-application of small portions of the diluted tartaremetic ointment,\r\nto the affected part, or by other gently stimulating ointments. Should\r\nthey become much irritated and very painful, a soft bread and milk\r\npoultice will in general afford relief, without interfering with the\r\nprogress of the eruption.

It should be always purchased in its crystalline\r\nform; and a solution of it in distilled water ought to furnish a copious\r\ngold coloured precipitate with sulphuret of ammonia; a precipitate\r\nsoluble in nitric acid, with acetate of lead; and a white and extremely\r\nthick precipitate, dissolving with facility in pure nitric acid, with\r\nlime water. If the crystals deliquesce, the presence of other salts may\r\nbe inferred. _M. Sexullas_, in a memoir of which there is a copious\r\nextract in the _Journal de Pharmacie_ for 1821, has shewn that all the\r\nantimonial preparations used in medicine, except carefully crystallized\r\n_Tartar Emetic_, contain more or less arsenic, which metal was\r\noriginally combined with the antimony in the ore, and has continued\r\npertinaciously associated with it through all its modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             AQUA. _Water._\r\n\r\nWater, from its extensive powers as a solvent, never occurs in a state\r\nof absolute purity, although the nature and degree of its contamination\r\nmust necessarily vary according to circumstances and situation. It is\r\ngenerally found holding earthy matter in a state of mechanical\r\nsuspension, or saline and other bodies in chemical solution. The usual\r\nvarieties of common water are classed and defined by Celsus; and modern\r\nchemists have not found any reason to reject the arrangement. “_Aqua\r\nlevissima pluvialis est; deinde fontana, tum ex flumine, tum ex puteo;\r\nposthæc ex nive, aut glacie; gravior his ex lacu; gravissima ex\r\npalude._”\r\n\r\n1. RAIN WATER. _Aqua Pluvialis_, when collected in the open fields, is\r\ncertainly the purest natural water, and consequently of the least\r\nspecific gravity; the bodies which it holds in solution are, carbonic\r\nacid, a minute portion of carbonate of lime, with traces of muriate of\r\nlime. DEW is said to be water saturated with air. Rain water ought,\r\nhowever, to be boiled and strained whenever it is collected near large\r\ntowns; Hippocrates gives this advice, and M. Margraaf of Berlin has\r\nshewn the wisdom of the precaution by a satisfactory series of\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n2. SPRING WATER. _Aqua Fontana_, in addition to the substances detected\r\nin rain water, generally contains a small portion of muriate of soda,\r\nand frequently other salts; but the larger springs are purer than\r\nsmaller ones, and those which occur in primitive countries, and in\r\nsiliceous rocks, or beds of gravel, necessarily contain the least\r\nimpregnation. An important practical distinction has been founded upon\r\nthe fact, that the water of some springs dissolves soap, whilst that of\r\nothers decomposes, and curdles it; the former has been termed _soft_,\r\nthe latter _hard_ water; soft water is a more powerful solvent of all\r\nvegetable matters, and is consequently to be preferred for domestic as\r\nwell as medicinal purposes; the brewer knows well from experience how\r\nmuch more readily and copiously _soft_ water will dissolve the\r\nextractive matter of his malt. Horses by an instinctive sagacity always\r\nprefer soft water, and when by necessity or inattention they are\r\nconfined to that which is _hard_, their coats become rough and\r\nill-conditioned, and they are frequently attacked with the gripes.\r\nPigeons also refuse hard water when they have been accustomed to that\r\nwhich is soft.[382]\r\n\r\n3. RIVER WATER. _Aqua ex Flumine_, being derived from the conflux of\r\nnumerous springs and rain water, generally possesses considerable\r\npurity; that the proportion of its saline ingredients should be small,\r\nis easily explained by the precipitation which must necessarily take\r\nplace from the union of different solutions; it is, however, liable to\r\nhold in suspension particles of earthy matter, which impair its\r\ntransparency, and sometimes its salubrity; this is particularly observed\r\nof the Seine, the Ganges, and the Nile.[383]\r\n\r\n4. WELL WATER. _Aqua ex Puteo_, is essentially the same as spring water,\r\nbeing derived from the same source; it is, however, more liable to\r\nimpurity from its stagnation, or slow infiltration;[384] hence our old\r\nwells furnish much purer water than those which are more recent, as the\r\nsoluble particles are gradually washed away. Mr. Dalton observes that\r\nthe more any spring is drawn from, the _softer_ the water becomes.\r\n\r\n5. SNOW WATER. _Aqua ex Nive_, has been supposed[385] to be unwholesome,\r\nand in particular to produce bronchocele, from the prevalence of that\r\ndisease in the Alps, but it does not appear upon what principle its\r\ninsalubrity can depend; the prejudice however is a very ancient one, for\r\nHippocrates observes that snow or ice water is unwholesome, in\r\nconsequence of its finer particles being evaporated and lost during its\r\nsolution: it appears to differ only from rain water in being destitute\r\nof air, to which water is certainly indebted for its briskness, and\r\nperhaps for many of its good effects upon animals and vegetables. The\r\nsame observations apply to _Ice Water_.\r\n\r\n6. LAKE WATER. _Aqua ex Lacu_, is a collection of rain, spring, and\r\nriver waters, contaminated with various animal and vegetable bodies,\r\nwhich from its stagnant nature have undergone putrefaction in it.\r\n\r\n7. MARSH WATER. _Aqua ex Palude_ being the most stagnant is the most\r\nimpure of all water, and is generally loaded with decomposing vegetable\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the impurities of water are capable of influencing its\r\nsalubrity, has been a subject of interesting inquiry from the age of\r\nHippocrates to the present day. To many of these natural contaminations,\r\ntoo much importance has been certainly attached; it is an affected\r\nrefinement to suppose that the presence of minute portions of such\r\nearthy and calcareous salts, as generally occur in solution, can impart\r\nany noxious quality to water;[386] whilst on the contrary, animal and\r\nvegetable impurities, or earthy bodies in a state of mechanical\r\nsuspension, cannot fail to prove injurious, and must be regarded as the\r\ntrue “SCELERA AQUARUM.” Guided by false analogies many have supposed\r\nthat they recognised the origin of all calcareous diseases in the earthy\r\nimpurities of water; the researches however of chemistry have removed\r\nthis delusion, by demonstrating that the substances found in water never\r\nenter into the composition of urinary calculi.[387] Metallic and other\r\naccidental contaminations are necessarily highly injurious, and the\r\nwater in which their presence is suspected, should be submitted to the\r\nmost careful examination.\r\n\r\nFor the purification and preservation of water numerous methods have\r\nbeen adopted; the mechanical impurities may be removed by filtration,\r\nwhich is performed through porous stones, or alternate layers of sand or\r\ncharcoal; muddy water may be also cleared by adding a few grains of alum\r\nto each pint,[388] and in that proportion, the water is not rendered in\r\nthe least disagreeable: when water has contracted a putrid smell, it may\r\nbe rendered sweet by agitating it with a small portion of magnesia, or\r\nwith black oxide of manganese, in the proportion of 1½ parts to 250\r\nparts of water. Dr. Black observes that nitrate of silver, which is one\r\nof the most antiseptic substances known, will preserve water from\r\nputrefaction for ever, and that it may at any time be separated\r\ntherefrom in a few minutes by adding a small lump of common salt; this\r\nfact in itself is curious, but the experiment is too hazardous to be\r\nrecommended. Dr. Alston prefers lime, as a preservative of the water,\r\nand proposes to remove it by the addition of a carbonate of magnesia;\r\nDr. Henry has however found that it is more economically precipitated by\r\nthe introduction of a current of carbonic acid into the cask. As that\r\npeculiar property of water which is termed _hardness_, generally depends\r\nupon the presence of _sulphate of lime_, the addition of an alkaline\r\ncarbonate twenty-four hours previous to its being used, will be found to\r\nrestore it, or if it should depend upon _supercarbonate of lime_, long\r\nebullition without any addition will be found sufficient for its cure.\r\n\r\nWater when kept for a long time in casks, especially on long voyages, is\r\npartially decomposed, and a volume of carburetted hydrogen is\r\nevolved,[389] imparting to such water the peculiar smell and taste which\r\ncharacterise it; this decomposition may in a great degree be obviated by\r\ncharring the interior of the water casks; it is, however, prevented in\r\nthe Navy by substituting iron tanks for wooden vessels. In Pharmacy it\r\nought to be remembered that whenever common water is employed it should\r\nnot be _hard_; filtered rainwater maybe recommended as the most eligible\r\non such occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                AQUA DESTILLATA. L.E.D. Distilled Water.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Taste_, vapid from the absence of air, and slightly\r\nempyreumatic in consequence probably of the presence of a small quantity\r\nof extractive matter which has undergone partial decomposition; a\r\nfluid-ounce weighs 454½ grains. MEDICINAL USE. In extemporaneous\r\nprescriptions, distilled water should be always ordered whenever the\r\nformula contains any of the following substances:—_Acidum Sulphuricum_;\r\n_Acidum Citricum_; _Antimonium Tartarizatum_; _Argenti Nitras_; _Cuprum\r\nAmmoniatum_; _Ferrum Tartarizatum_; _Hydrargyri Oxy-murias_; _Liquor\r\nAmmoniæ_; _Liquor Plumbi Sub-Acetatis_; _Liquor Potassæ_; _Plumbi\r\nAcetas_; _Solutio Muriatis Barytæ_; _Vinum Ferri_; _Zinci Sulphas_;\r\n_Ferri Sulphas_. Distilled water ought also to be employed in\r\npreparations where much water is evaporated, as in the formation of\r\nextracts, since the residual matter of common water will remain mixed\r\nwith the product of the process, and uselessly add to its bulk, or even\r\nin some cases produce in it chemical changes; unless however under such\r\ncircumstances, common water purified by filtration should be ordered, as\r\nthe air which it contains imparts to it a pleasant and sprightly\r\nflavour. In making infusions or decoctions, it is very important that\r\nthe water should be free from those impurities which impart to it\r\n_hardness_, and which render it a far less powerful solvent of vegetable\r\nmatter, nor indeed can resinous substances be mixed with such water,\r\neven when assisted by a mucilaginous medium. On which account, in\r\nprescribing emulsions, it may perhaps be prudent to direct the\r\nemployment of distilled water. TESTS OF ITS PURITY. Its transparency\r\nought not to be disturbed by the addition of nitrate of silver, or\r\nmuriate of baryta.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        AQUA MARINA. Sea Water.\r\n\r\nUntil the late able researches of Dr. Murray, we possessed but an\r\nimperfect knowledge of the composition of sea water; it is not therefore\r\nsurprising that the analysis performed by different chemists should be\r\nfound to be so materially at variance; the true cause of such\r\ndiscordance is now easily understood, for it appears, that in the\r\nexamination of a mineral water or any compound saline solution, the\r\nsubstances obtained from it are not necessarily the original\r\ningredients, but frequently the products of new combinations established\r\nby the operation of analysis, and that consequently the nature of the\r\nresult obtained may vary according to the modes in which such analysis\r\nhas been conducted, or even according to the degree of dilution in which\r\nthe saline substances exist.[390] The elements of the salts contained in\r\na pint of sea water are _Lime_ 2·9, _Magnesia_ 14·8, _Soda_ 96·3,\r\n_Sulphuric Acid_ 14·4, _Muriatic Acid_ 97·7, total 226·1 grains, and\r\nsupposing these elements to be combined in the modes which Dr. Murray’s\r\nviews appear to establish, the saline contents of a pint of sea water\r\nmay be expressed as follows, _Muriate of Soda_ 159·3, _Muriate of\r\nMagnesia_ 35·5, _Muriate of Lime_ 5·7, _Sulphate of Soda_ 25·6 grains,\r\ntotal 226·1 grains; besides such saline contents, it is contaminated\r\nwith various animal and vegetable bodies, in consequence of which it\r\nbecomes, when long kept, highly offensive; it ought also to be stated\r\nthat Dr. Wollaston has discovered the presence of a minute proportion of\r\npotass in sea water; and Dr. Marcet has more lately detected ammonia in\r\ncombination with muriatic acid. MEDICINAL USE. As a cathartic, a pint is\r\nthe ordinary quantity, which should be taken in the morning, at two\r\ndoses, with an interval of half an hour between each; this quantity\r\ncontains half an ounce of purgative salt, of which about three-fourths\r\nare muriate of soda, but it is much more active than a similar portion\r\nof any artificial combination. In procuring sea water for medicinal\r\npurposes, there is a precaution, the importance of which experience has\r\nsuggested to me, that it be not hastily drank on the beach, before the\r\nparticles of sand, with which under such circumstances it is generally\r\nmixed, are allowed to subside; from the neglect of this precaution I\r\nhave witnessed serious consequences. The most important advantages of\r\nsea water are derived from its external use as a bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         AQUÆ DESTILLATÆ. L.D.\r\n\r\n                AQUÆ STILLATITIÆ. E. _Distilled Waters._\r\n\r\nThese are waters impregnated with the essential oils of vegetables, and\r\nare principally designed as grateful vehicles for the exhibition of more\r\nactive remedies; ample directions for preparing them are given in the\r\nseveral Pharmacopœias, and if they be rectified by redistillation they\r\nmay be kept for several years; the usual mode of preserving them is by\r\nadding spirit, which has also the incidental advantage of preventing\r\nthem from being frozen during the winter season. Some recommend a film\r\nof the essential oil to be diffused over the water’s surface. They may\r\nbe extemporaneously prepared by adding to water what have been called\r\n_Essences_, which consist of essential oil and alcohol, or by rubbing\r\nany essential oil with ten times its weight of sugar, or, what answers\r\nstill better, of magnesia: when however they are so prepared they never\r\nretain their transparency. The college, in the present Pharmacopœia,\r\nhave directed the distillation off the essential oil, as well as off the\r\nrecent herb; this alteration is one of practical convenience. The\r\nproperties of each water may be learnt by referring to the vegetable\r\nfrom which it is distilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    AQUÆ MINERALES. Mineral Waters.\r\n\r\nAlthough all waters that flow from the earth, are, as they contain\r\nmineral bodies in solution, strictly speaking, _mineral_ waters, yet\r\nthis term is conventionally applied to such only as are distinguished\r\nfrom spring, lake, river, or other water, by a peculiarity in colour,\r\ntaste, smell, or any obvious properties, or by the medicinal effects\r\nwhich they produce, or are known to be capable of producing.\r\n\r\nTo the medical practitioner the history of these waters is most\r\ninteresting and instructive, involving highly important subjects of\r\nchemical and physiological inquiry. These waters are without doubt\r\nindebted for their medicinal virtues to the operation of the substances\r\nwhich they hold dissolved, but this is so materially aided by the\r\npeculiar state of dilution in which they exist, as well as by the mere\r\nbulk and temperature of the water itself, as to render extremely\r\ndoubtful the success of every attempt to concentrate their powers by\r\nevaporation. To what extent dilution may modify the chemical condition\r\nof saline solutions has been satisfactorily demonstrated by the\r\nresearches of Dr. Murray (see _Aqua Marina_), and to what degree an\r\nincrease in the solubility of any remedy may influence its medicinal\r\nproperties has been considered at some length in the first part of this\r\nwork, (_page 172_.) It is certain that, in general, soluble salts are\r\ncapable of exerting a much more powerful effect upon the animal economy,\r\nthan those which are insoluble; on which account, the earthy muriates,\r\nespecially that of lime, are amongst the most active ingredients of\r\nmineral waters. Although chemical analysis has frequently from its own\r\nimperfection failed in ascertaining their presence, it seems probable\r\nthat _muriate of lime_ and _sulphate of soda_ exist in all those springs\r\nthat furnish, by the usual methods of examination, _sulphate of lime_\r\nand _muriate of soda_; for the same reasons it is equally probable that\r\niron, which in certain waters has been supposed from the analysis to\r\nexist as a _carbonate_, is in its native solution a true _muriate_; this\r\nis undoubtedly the fact with respect to the Bath waters. Is it then\r\nsurprising, that medical practitioners should hitherto have failed in\r\ntheir attempts to emulate, by artificial arrangements, the medical\r\nefficacy of active and mineral springs? For the investigation of the\r\ntrue composition of mineral waters the researches of Dr. Murray furnish\r\na simple and elegant formula. _Determine by precipitants the weight of\r\nthe acids and bases, suppose them united in such a manner that they\r\nshall form the most soluble salts, and these salts will constitute the\r\ntrue saline constituents of the water under examination._\r\n\r\nMineral Waters admit of being divided into four classes, viz.\r\n\r\n1. ACIDULOUS; owing their properties chiefly to carbonic acid; they are\r\ntonic and diuretic, and in large doses produce a transient exhilaration;\r\nthe most celebrated are _Pyrmont_, _Seltzer_, _Spa_, _Carlsbad_, and\r\n_Scarborough_.\r\n\r\n2. CHALYBEATE; containing iron in the form of _sulphate_, _carbonate_,\r\nor _muriate_;[391] they have a styptic, inky taste: _Hartfell_ near\r\n_Moffat_, _Peterhead_, _Tunbridge_, _Brighton_, _Cheltenham_, _Bath_,\r\n_Lemington Priors_, _Castle Horneck_, near _Penzance_, &c.\r\n\r\n3. SULPHUREOUS WATERS derive their character from sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\neither uncombined, or united with lime, or an alkali: _Engien_, _Aix la\r\nChapelle_, _Harrowgate_, _Moffat_.\r\n\r\n4. SALINE; mostly purgative, and are advantageously employed in those\r\nhypochondriacal and visceral diseases that require continued, and\r\nmoderate relaxation of the bowels; _Cheltenham_, _Leamington_,\r\n_Seidlitz_, and all brackish waters.\r\n\r\nSome springs, as those of _Bath_, _Matlock_, and _Buxton_, owe their\r\nvirtues rather to temperature than to any other cause, and others, as\r\n_Malvern_, to the diluent power of the water.\r\n\r\nIn the Codex Medicamentarius of Paris, formulæ are introduced for the\r\npreparation of several of the more distinguished mineral waters, under\r\nthe head “_Aquæ Minerales Arte Factæ_.”[392]\r\n\r\n\r\n                ARGENTI NITRAS. L. Nitras Argenti. E.D.\r\n\r\n           _Fused Nitrate of Silver_, olim, _Lunar Caustic_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. Fused nitrate of silver is in small cylinders of a dark grey\r\ncolour, and presenting, when broken across, a crystalline structure.\r\n_Odour_, none; _Taste_, intensely bitter, austere and metallic; it\r\ntinges the skin indelibly black; when perfectly free from copper, it is\r\nnot deliquescent. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION; oxide of silver 70, nitric acid\r\n30, or one atom of oxide and one atom of acid. SOLUBILITY. In an equal\r\nweight of water, at 60°; it is also soluble in alcohol. The solution\r\nreadily yields transparent colourless crystals, the primary form of\r\nwhich is a _right rhombic prism_. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Fixed\r\nalkalies_ and _alkaline earths_, the _muriatic_, _sulphuric_, and\r\n_tartaric_ acids, and all the salts which contain them; _Soaps_,\r\n_arsenic_, _hydro-sulphurets_, _astringent vegetable infusions_,\r\n_undistilled waters_. The solutions of nitrate of silver are not\r\ndisturbed by ammonia, the _ammoniuret_ being very soluble; the carbonate\r\nof ammonia, however, produces a precipitation. Nitrate of silver tinges\r\nthe skin and hair black, and has been frequently employed for the latter\r\npurpose;[394] it likewise forms the basis of permanent ink.[395]\r\nMEDICINAL USES. Tonic, antispasmodic, and escharotic; it is said to\r\nprove efficacious in epilepsy, but during a trial for several years in\r\nthe Westminster hospital, I never could discover its virtues; many of\r\nthe cases in which it has been supposed to have been successful,\r\nprobably derived advantage from the purgative medicines which were\r\nsimultaneously administered. It possesses a bitter taste, and it has\r\nbeen said to act like vegetable bitters upon the digestive organs, and\r\nto offer a resource in dyspeptic complaints. It is principally useful as\r\nan external application, and may be considered as the strongest and most\r\nmanageable caustic that we possess;[396] whilst in solution it acts as a\r\nuseful stimulant in indolent ulcers; and being possessed of the power of\r\ncoagulating animal matter, it does not spread to any extent, and is\r\ntherefore extremely convenient where a large eschar is to be avoided. A\r\nweak solution of this metallic salt has lately been strongly recommended\r\nby a French surgeon, as a remedy for piles of long standing; it also\r\nforms an excellent lotion to excite the weak granulations of fungous\r\nulcers. It is, moreover, said to be highly useful as an injection in\r\ncases of puriform discharges from the ear; before we direct however such\r\nan application, it is highly necessary that we should ascertain the\r\ntympanum to be entire, or the liquid may escape into the internal ear,\r\nand occasion very alarming irritation; an event which unhappily\r\noccurred, not long since, in the case of a noble duke of high military\r\nrenown. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. For internal use, in pills made with crumb\r\nof bread, with the addition of some sugar, to prevent the mass from\r\nbeing too hard. Dose, gr. 1/8, gradually increased to gr. j.\r\nADULTERATIONS. _Copper_ may be always suspected when it deliquesces, and\r\nis to be immediately detected by its solution assuming a blue colour,\r\nwhen supersaturated with ammonia. The sticks should be preserved in\r\nclosely stopped phials, and covered with soft and dry paper. ANTIDOTE.\r\nWhen this substance has been taken in excess, muriate of soda is its\r\ntrue antidote; indeed, so completely does it decompose, and separate it\r\nfrom water, that if a saturated solution of nitrate of silver be\r\nfiltered through common salt, it may be afterwards drunk with impunity.\r\nThis circumstance alone, would of necessity render nitrate of silver a\r\nvery uncertain remedy; and yet it is evident that the basis of this salt\r\nis occasionally absorbed, for there are several cases upon record, in\r\nwhich the oxyd of silver has been deposited in the rete mucosum, and\r\ngiven a purple hue of a very singular appearance to the patient; I have\r\nlately witnessed an instance of this kind in a lady who had taken large\r\ndoses of the nitrate, for the purpose of curing a dyspeptic complaint;\r\nand several other similar cases stand recorded in different works.\r\n\r\n\r\n            ARMORACIÆ RADIX.

As a stimulant in paralysis it\r\nis often useful; Sydenham found it successful in dropsies which were\r\nconsequent on intermittent fevers; Cullen recommends a syrup made with\r\nthe infusion of horse radish, to remove that species of hoarseness which\r\ndepends upon local relaxation; Dr. Withering extols an infusion of this\r\nroot in milk as a cosmetic both safe and effectual.

Arsenicum. D. _White Arsenic_.\r\n\r\n                   _Arsenious Acid._ vulgo _Arsenic_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, shining semivitreous lumps, breaking with a\r\nconchoidal fracture, and when reduced to powder, bearing some\r\nresemblance to white sugar; _Taste_, acrid and corrosive, but not in any\r\ndegree corresponding with its virulence, leaving an impression of\r\nsweetness. _Specific gravity_ 3·7; it is volatilized at the temperature\r\nof 383° _Fah:_ and by a strong heat is vitrified into a transparent\r\nglass capable of crystallizing in tetrahedra with truncated angles, or\r\nrather in octohedra. In the state of vapour it is quite inodorous,\r\nalthough it is asserted in many chemical works of authority to yield a\r\nsmell like that of garlic; the fact is that the alliaceous or\r\ngarlic-like smell is wholly confined to _metallic_ arsenic in a state of\r\nvapour, and whenever the arsenious acid seems to yield this odour, we\r\nmay infer that its decomposition has taken place; this happens when it\r\nis projected upon ignited charcoal, or when heated in contact with those\r\nmetallic bodies which readily unite with oxygen, as _Antimony_ and\r\n_Tin_. It is stated by Orfila and other chemists, that if it be\r\nprojected upon heated copper the alliaceous odour is evolved. This\r\nassertion is undoubtedly true, but the fact requires to be explained\r\nwith more precision, or we may fall into an important error respecting\r\nit. The phenomenon takes place only when the copper is in a state of\r\nignition, at which temperature its affinity for oxygen enables it to\r\nreduce the arsenious acid; for I find by experiment that if a few grains\r\nof this substance be heated on a plate of copper, by means of a spirit\r\nlamp or blow-pipe, no odour is perceptible, for the whole of the acid is\r\ndissipated before the copper can acquire a sufficiently exalted\r\ntemperature to deoxidize it. If the arsenious acid be heated on a plate\r\nof zinc, the smell is not evolved until the metal is in the state of\r\nfusion; if instead of these metals we employ in our experiments those of\r\ngold, silver, or platinum, no alliaceous smell whatever is produced, at\r\nany temperature. It however deserves particular notice, that the flame\r\nof the spirit lamp is itself capable of decomposing the oxyd, in\r\nconsequence of the operation of its hydrogen: a fact which is very\r\nlikely to betray the chemist into the fallacious belief that the oxyd\r\ndoes yield the odour in question.[399] It is probable that arsenical\r\nvapours which yield this peculiar odour are less noxious than those\r\nwhich are inodorous, but I am not aware that the knowledge of this fact\r\ncan be applied to any purpose of practical importance.[400] CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. This substance possesses many of the essential habitudes of\r\nan acid, as for instance, that of combining with the pure alkalies to\r\nsaturation; it is therefore very properly denominated _Arsenious Acid_.\r\nIt may be farther acidified by distilling it with nitrous acid, and the\r\ncompound which results is a white concrete substance termed _Arsenic\r\nAcid_; from experiments on the quantity of oxygen absorbed by metallic\r\narsenic, during its conversion into these two compounds, instituted by\r\nProust and Davy, it appears that the _arsenious_ acid consists of about\r\n25 of oxygen and 75 of metal, and the _arsenic_ acid of 33 of oxygen and\r\n67 of metal; or, the quantity of metal being the same, that the oxygen\r\nin the latter compound is to that in the former nearly as three to two.\r\nSOLUBILITY. We have but lately been set right upon this point; Klaproth\r\nhas shewn that it requires for its solution 400 parts of water at 60°\r\nand only 13 at 212°, and moreover, that if 100 parts of water be boiled\r\non the arsenious acid, and suffered to cool, it will retain three grains\r\nin solution, and deposit the remainder in tetrahedral crystals; this\r\nfact shews the importance of employing boiling water in every chemical\r\nexamination of substances supposed to contain arsenic. It is soluble in\r\nalcohol and oils, the former taking up two per cent.; with lime water it\r\nproduces a white precipitate of _arsenite of lime_, which is soluble in\r\nan excess of arsenious acid; with magnesia it forms a soluble\r\n_arsenite_, which proves very virulent. The poisonous effects of\r\narsenious acid are so amply detailed in medical works,[401] that it\r\nwould be superfluous to dwell upon them in this place; it may however be\r\ninteresting and useful to record an account of the pernicious influence\r\nof arsenical fumes upon organized beings, as I have been enabled to\r\nascertain in the copper smelting works, and tin burning-houses of\r\nCornwall. This influence is very apparent in the condition both of the\r\nanimals and vegetables in the vicinity; horses and cows commonly lose\r\ntheir hoofs, and the latter are often to be seen in the neighbouring\r\npastures crawling on their knees, and not unfrequently suffering from a\r\ncancerous affection in their rumps, whilst the milch cows, in addition\r\nto these miseries, are soon deprived of their milk; the men employed in\r\nthe works are more healthy than we could _a priori_ have supposed\r\npossible; the antidote upon which they all rely with confidence,\r\nwhenever they are infested with more than an ordinary portion of\r\narsenical vapour, is _sweet oil_, and an annual sum is allowed by the\r\nproprietors in order that it may be constantly supplied; this opinion is\r\nnot solitary, for Tachenius relates that the poisonous effects, such as\r\nconvulsions, gripes, and bloody stools, with which he was seized from\r\nexposure to the fumes of arsenic, were relieved by milk and oil.\r\n\r\nIt deserves notice that the smelters are occasionally affected with a\r\ncancerous disease in the scrotum, similar to that which infests\r\nchimney-sweepers, and it is singular that Stahl in describing the\r\nputrescent tendency in the bodies of those who die from this poison,\r\nmentions in particular the gangrenous appearance of these parts. It is a\r\nvery extraordinary fact that previous to the establishment of the copper\r\nworks in Cornwall, the marshes in their vicinity were continually\r\nexciting intermittent fever, whereas since that period a case of ague\r\nhas not occurred in the neighbourhood; I have heard it remarked by the\r\nmen in the works, that the smoke _kills_ all fevers. The fact is here\r\nstated without any other comment than that the agricultural improvements\r\nwhich have taken place in the district, are not sufficient to afford any\r\nclue to the explanation of the circumstance. MEDICINAL USES. Much has\r\nbeen said upon this subject, and the propriety and safety of its\r\nexhibition has been often questioned; there can be no doubt but that the\r\ngreatest circumspection is required in the practitioner who administers\r\nit, and it ought not, in my opinion, to be employed until other remedies\r\nhave failed; that it is capable of accumulating in the system is very\r\nevident, and this, in certain habits, may predispose the patient to\r\nserious diseases; the form in which it is most manageable and least\r\ndangerous, is that of solution. See _Liquor Arsenicalis_. Some\r\npractitioners have exhibited it in substance, made into pills, by\r\nrubbing one grain with ten of sugar, and then beating the mixture with a\r\nsufficient quantity of crumb of bread to form ten pills, one of which is\r\na dose. The Chinese and other oriental nations form the sulphuret of\r\narsenic (_realgar_) into medical cups, and use lemon juice, after it has\r\nstood some hours in them, by way of cathartic. As an external\r\napplication, arsenic has long been extolled in the cure of cancers; the\r\ncaustic so extensively used under the sanction of the late Mr. Justamond\r\nin cases of open cancer, consisted of two parts of Antimony, and one of\r\nArsenious acid, fluxed together in a crucible, and afterwards levigated,\r\nand reduced to the requisite degree of mildness by the addition of\r\npowdered Opium.[402] But it deserves notice in this place, that repeated\r\nexperiments have proved that arsenic kills[403] more rapidly when\r\napplied externally to an abraded part, than when internally\r\nadministered. See page 132. _Lionardo di Capoa_ relates the case of a\r\nchild killed by the violent vomiting and purging arising from a slight\r\nwound made in the head by a comb, wet with oil, in which Arsenic had\r\nbeen infused for the purpose of killing vermin; and we have numerous\r\ninstances on record, where the application of arsenical cerates and\r\nointments has been followed by violent and dangerous symptoms. We also\r\nlearn from the different historians of the Plague of London, that the\r\narsenical amulets which were worn, as preservatives, on that occasion,\r\nwere sometimes attended with deleterious consequences; _Crato_ (Epist.\r\n168.) observed an ulcer of the breast produced by them. _Vernascha_,\r\nviolent pains and syncope. Amongst the foreign authors who have related\r\ncases of poisoning by the external application of Arsenic we may mention\r\n_Desgranges_ (_Recueil Period: de la Société de Med: de Paris_, T. vi.\r\np. 22.) who records the history of a chambermaid, poisoned by having\r\nrubbed her head with an arsenical ointment for the purpose of destroying\r\nvermin; and _Roux_ (_Nouveaux Elemens de Med: Operat. par. J. P. Roux_,)\r\nwho confessed to have killed a young girl of eighteen by an application\r\nof the “_Pate Arsenicale_” to a cancerous breast. To the Empirics of our\r\nown times we are indebted for many fatal illustrations of the subject.\r\nSince the last edition of this work, a Lady applied to a well known\r\nQuack, distinguished for his impudent pretensions in the treatment of\r\ncancer, and submitted to a caustic application to the breast. In a short\r\ntime paralysis ensued, and the application was discovered to contain a\r\nlarge proportion of Arsenic, and that the disease, for the cure of which\r\nit had been applied, was _not_ cancer. A somewhat analogous case\r\noccurred under the care of a bold empiric in the neighbourhood of St.\r\nGeorge’s Fields, who undertook to remove the deformity of bow legs in a\r\ndandy drawing-master! by _rasping the shin bones_, and applying arsenic\r\nto the surface of the wound; in consequence of which, in addition to\r\nextensive local mischief, the unhappy dupe became paralytic. It is also\r\nnecessary to inform the practitioner that Arsenious acid has been known\r\nto produce poisonous effects when applied to the _unbroken_ skin; a case\r\nof this nature is related by Desgranges, in the sixth volume of the\r\n_Recueil Periodique de la Soc: de Med_: another may be found in the 22d\r\nvolume of the _Acta Germanica_ (1730); and Renault obtained similar\r\nresults in his experiments on animals. When the system is under the\r\ninfluence of arsenic, the following symptoms will appear, viz.\r\nthickness, redness, and stiffness of the palpebræ, soreness of the gums,\r\nptyalism, itching over the surface of the body, restlessness, cough,\r\npain in the stomach and bowels, head-ache, and I have also occasionally\r\nnoticed paucity of urine, and even stranguary, a fact of which I find no\r\nmention in other authors. Strange as it may appear, _Arsenic_ has been\r\ninhaled, together with the vapours of frankincense, myrrh, and those of\r\nother gums during a paroxysm of asthma! This extraordinary practice\r\narose from the practitioner mistaking the gum juniper, or _Vernix_ of\r\nthe Arabians, which by their medical authors was prescribed in\r\nfumigations under the name of _Sandarach_, for the Σανδαρακη of\r\nAristotle, which was a sulphured of arsenic.\r\n\r\nADULTERATIONS. It is frequently sophisticated with chalk, gypsum, or\r\nsulphate of barytes; the fraud is instantly detected by its not being\r\nentirely volatilized by heat, or by any insoluble residuum occurring in\r\npreparing the _Liquor Arsenicalis_, according to the directions of the\r\npharmacopœia. To many the adulteration of so active a substance may seem\r\nunimportant, but in consequence of its being thus rendered a medicine of\r\nvariable activity, it is one of the most dangerous frauds which can be\r\ncommitted; a very unpleasant circumstance lately occurred from such a\r\ncause in one of our public institutions: arsenic had been obtained from\r\nthe shop of a respectable chemist, who had not usually supplied the\r\nestablishment, for the purpose of preparing the arsenical solution: the\r\narticle happened to be less adulterated than that which had been\r\npreviously employed; the solution however was prepared in the usual way,\r\nand the usual dose was continued, when the patients were soon seized\r\nwith violent pains in the bowels, and the cause was not detected until\r\nby an examination of the bottle the usual sediment was not discovered.\r\n\r\nANTIDOTES. Late researches have shewn that _sulphuret of potass_, on\r\nwhich physicians have placed so much reliance, merits no confidence. The\r\ngreat indication to be fulfilled in all cases of poisoning is to excite\r\nvomiting, and to administer liquids which are the least liable to act as\r\nsolvents of the acrid matter, on which account lime water presents\r\nitself as a very appropriate fluid. The subject, however, is very fully\r\nconsidered in the first part of this work, to which I am very desirous\r\nof directing the attention of the medical practitioner; see _Antidotes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Methods of detecting the presence of Arsenious Acid._\r\n\r\n1. _By its reduction to a metallic state._ Mix a portion of the\r\nsuspected powder with three times its weight of _black flux_;[404] put\r\nthe mixture into a thin glass tube, hermetically closed[405] at one end,\r\nabout eight inches in length, and one-fourth of an inch in diameter;\r\nshould any of the powder adhere to the sides of the tube, it must be\r\ncarefully brushed off with a feather, so that the inner surface of its\r\nupper part may be perfectly clean and dry; the closed end of the tube,\r\nby way of security, may be thinly coated with a mixture of pipe-clay and\r\nsand,[406] but this operation is not absolutely necessary; the open\r\nextremity is to be loosely plugged with a piece of paper; the coated end\r\nmust be now heated on a chaffing dish of red hot coals, when the\r\narsenic, if present, will sublime, and be found lining with a brilliant\r\nmetallic crust the upper part of the tube; a portion of this reduced\r\nmetal, if it be arsenic, will, when laid on heated iron, exhale in dense\r\nfumes, which are characterised by a strong smell of garlic. Mr. Phillips\r\nhas lately stated that the tube may be sufficiently heated, for the\r\npurpose of metallization, by means of a spirit lamp.[407]\r\n\r\nIt merits particular notice, that in reducing by the above process the\r\narsenious acid to the state of metal, the presence of potass in the flux\r\nis very essential, since it forms immediately an _arsenite of potass_,\r\nand thereby fixes the arsenious acid, and prevents it from being\r\nvolatilized before the temperature is sufficiently high to enable the\r\ncharcoal to decompose it; an ignorance of this fact has not unfrequently\r\nproved a source of disappointment and fallacy.\r\n\r\nAnother method of identifying _white arsenic_ by metallization, is to\r\nform at the moment of its reduction, an alloy with copper, which is\r\neasily effected in the following manner,—Mix the suspected powder with\r\nblack flux, as in the former experiment, and place the mixture between\r\ntwo polished plates of copper, bind them tight together by iron wire,\r\nand expose them to a low read heat; if the included substance contained\r\narsenic, a silvery white stain will be left on the surface of the\r\ncopper, which is an alloy of the two metals. If in this, as in the\r\nformer experiment, charcoal be employed without the addition of a fixed\r\nalkali, the result may, for the same reason, prove unsatisfactory. But,\r\nwith whatever care this experiment is conducted, it is, to say the\r\nleast, a clumsy and unsatisfactory test, and ought never to be relied\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n2. _By the application of certain Reagents, or Tests, to its Solutions._\r\n\r\nA great and important question has arisen in medical jurisprudence,\r\nwhether any chemical proof of the presence of _white arsenic_, short of\r\nits actual reduction to the state of metal, can be depended upon, or\r\nought to be received as evidence in the courts of criminal law. After a\r\nfull experimental investigation of the subject, and an impartial review\r\nof all the facts which bear upon the question, I feel no hesitation in\r\ndeclaring it to be my conviction, that _white arsenic may be detected\r\nwithout any fear of fallacy_, _by a proper application of certain\r\ntests_, and that the contrary opinion is entirely founded in error, and\r\nunsupported by experiment, as will more fully appear in the sequel.[408]\r\n\r\n(A) _Fused Nitrate of Silver_, or _Lunar Caustic_—For this test we are\r\nindebted to Mr. Hume of London, who first gave it to the public in the\r\nPhilosophical Magazine for May 1809, vol. xxxiii. His method of applying\r\nit is as follows: into a clean Florence flask introduce two or three\r\ngrains of the suspected powder, to which add about eight ounces of rain\r\nor distilled water, and heat the solution until it begins to boil, then\r\nwhile it boils frequently shake the flask, and add to the hot solution a\r\ngrain or two of sub-carbonate of potass, agitating the whole to make the\r\nmixture uniform. Pour into a wine glass about two table spoonsful of the\r\nsolution, and touch the surface of the fluid with a stick of lunar\r\ncaustic. If arsenic be present, a beautiful yellow precipitate will\r\ninstantly proceed from the point of contact, and settle towards the\r\nbottom of the glass as a flocculent and copious precipitate.\r\n\r\nBy this test the 60th part of a grain may be satisfactorily recognised\r\nin two ounces of water. The presence of some alkali is essential to the\r\nsuccess of the experiment, since arsenious acid is unable, by the\r\noperation of simple affinity, to decompose the nitrate of silver.[409]\r\nThe validity of this test has been questioned on the following grounds,\r\nwhich shall be fairly examined in order.\r\n\r\nOBJECTION 1. _The alkaline phosphates are found to produce precipitates\r\nwith silver, analogous in colour and appearance to the arsenite of\r\nsilver._ This is undoubtedly the case when the experiment is performed\r\nin the manner just stated, but there are other reagents which will\r\nimmediately distinguish these bodies, as will be seen under the history\r\nof the _Ammoniuret of silver_; I have also shewn that there is a mode of\r\nso modifying the application of the silver test itself, that no error or\r\ndoubt can arise in the use of it from the presence of phosphoric\r\nsalts.[410] My method consists in conducting the trial on writing paper,\r\ninstead of in glasses, thus—drop the suspected fluid on a piece of white\r\npaper, making with it a broad line; along this line a stick of lunar\r\ncaustic is to be slowly drawn several times successively, when a streak\r\nis produced of a colour resembling that known by the name of _Indian\r\nYellow_; and this is equally produced by the presence of arsenic and\r\nthat of an alkaline phosphate, but the one from arsenic is rough, curdy,\r\nand flocculent, as if effected by a crayon, that from a phosphate\r\nhomogeneous and uniform, resembling a water-colour laid smoothly on with\r\na brush; but a most important and distinctive peculiarity soon succeeds,\r\nfor in less than two minutes the phosphoric yellow fades into a _sad\r\ngreen_, and becomes gradually darker, and ultimately quite black; while,\r\non the other hand, the arsenical yellow remains permanent, or nearly so,\r\nfor some time, when it becomes brown. In performing this experiment the\r\nsun-shine should be avoided, or the transitions of the colour will take\r\nplace too rapidly. It would be prudent also for the inexperienced\r\noperator to perform a similar experiment on a fluid known to contain\r\narsenic, and on another with a phosphoric salt, as a standard of\r\ncomparison. In this way the nitrate of silver, without the intervention\r\nof any other test, is fully capable of removing every ambiguity, and of\r\nfurnishing a distinguishing mark of difference between the chemical\r\naction of arsenic and that of the phosphates. Mr. Hume states that he\r\nhas repeated this experiment to his entire satisfaction,[411] and that,\r\nin a late unfortunate case of poisoning, he derived considerable\r\ninformation by its application. The laborious author of the London\r\nDispensatory accepts it as an excellent test, but observes that it is\r\nrendered more luminous by brushing the streak lightly over with liquid\r\nammonia immediately after the application of the caustic, when, if the\r\narsenic be present, a bright queen’s yellow is produced which remains\r\npermanent for nearly an hour; but that when the lunar caustic produces a\r\nwhite-yellow before the ammonia is applied, we may infer the presence of\r\nsome alkaline phosphate, rather than that of arsenic. One of the great\r\nadvantages of this test is the very small quantity that is required for\r\nexamination; it would be well therefore for the operator to perform the\r\nexperiment in both ways on a separate paper.\r\n\r\nOBJECTION 2. _The Muriates produce precipitates with silver so copious\r\nand flocculent as to overcome every indication which the presence of\r\narsenic would otherwise afford._ Dr. Marcet proposes to obviate this\r\ndifficulty, by adding to the fluid to be examined dilute nitric acid,\r\nand then cautiously applying the nitrate of silver until the\r\nprecipitation ceases; in this way the muriatic acid will be entirely\r\nremoved, whilst the arsenic, if it be present, will remain in solution,\r\nand may be rendered evident by the affusion of ammonia, which will\r\ninstantly produce the yellow precipitate in its characteristic form.\r\nThis mode however it must be confessed appears complicated, and requires\r\nsome chemical address for its accomplishment; it should be also known\r\nthat the yellow precipitate thus produced is not always permanent, for\r\nit is soluble in the nitrate of ammonia formed during the process. Under\r\nthese circumstances, it is surely preferable to precipitate at once from\r\nthe suspected fluid all the substances which nitrate of silver can\r\neffect, and then to expose the mixed and ambiguous precipitate so\r\nobtained, to a low heat in a glass tube, when the arsenious acid will be\r\nimmediately separated by sublimation. In this way the presence of\r\nmuriates may even in certain cases be serviceable, especially if the\r\nquantity of arsenic be minute; for by increasing the bulk of the\r\nprecipitate we shall decrease the difficulty of its examination. By this\r\nprocess, also, I should propose to meet the embarrassments which arise\r\nfrom the influence of various animal and vegetable substances, as milk,\r\nbroth, wine, &c. so frequently present in the suspected liquid, and\r\nwhich are known to alter the character of the arsenical indications. In\r\nthis case, however, we must not rely upon any single precipitant; after\r\nhaving thrown down all that is precipitable by the silver test, the\r\nsupernatant liquid should be decanted, slightly acidified by acetic\r\nacid, and submitted to the action of Sulphuretted Hydrogen; when, should\r\nany precipitate occur, it must be separated and added to the former. Dr.\r\nChristison has demonstrated the importance of this proceeding by shewing\r\nthat the precipitates, occasioned by the Ammoniurets of silver and\r\ncopper, are soluble in certain vegetable infusions.[412] M. Orfila\r\nproposes to remove the difficulties and embarrassments, occasioned by\r\nthe colouring matter of different media, by the application of\r\n_Chlorine_, so as to change the colour to a shade that will not offer\r\nany optical impediment to the characteristic indications of the\r\ndifferent tests. I am ready to admit that such a mode of proceeding may,\r\non certain occasions, assist the accomplished chemist in his analysis,\r\nbut in the hands of a person less accustomed to chemical manipulation, I\r\nhesitate not to declare that it is subject to fatal fallacies;[413]\r\nwhereas, by precipitating the whole, and submitting the precipitate to\r\nthe process of sublimation, we shall avoid every source of error. Why\r\nthen should we attempt to pursue our game through the windings of a\r\nlabyrinth, when a direct road lies before us, by which we may at once\r\ndrive it into the open plain? Mr. Phillips has recently proposed the\r\naddition of animal charcoal (_Ivory Black_) for the purpose of\r\ndestroying the colouring matter. He found that by mixing this substance\r\nwith the _Liquor Arsenicalis_, that the colouring matter was so\r\ncompletely destroyed in a few minutes, that the test of nitrate of\r\nsilver, or any other might be readily applied. This experiment was\r\nrepeated with Port wine, gravy soup, and a strong infusion of onions,\r\nand he succeeded in these cases in procuring a solution sufficiently\r\ncolourless for the application of the most delicate reagents. It might\r\nbe supposed, adds Mr. Phillips, that the Phosphoric acid which the\r\nanimal charcoal contains, might have some share in the production of the\r\nyellow precipitate with silver; he found, however, that water, or wine,\r\nwhich was merely digested on the animal charcoal, produced no effect\r\nwith the nitrate of silver, except a slight precipitate of chloride; and\r\nthis even, was prevented by lixiviation. I have, however, a serious\r\nobjection to offer to this proposal. Animal charcoal, by some mode of\r\noperation not understood, possesses the property of removing certain\r\nsubstances from their solution in water; I have already noticed this\r\neffect with respect to Lime water, (see p. 247, _note_), and I have\r\nlately found that it takes place with very dilute solutions of\r\nArsenic.[414] Hence charcoal, as we shall presently find, may be\r\nemployed for the purpose of detecting minute portions of arsenic.\r\n\r\nOBJECTION 3. _Chromate of potass produces, with Nitrate of Silver, a\r\nyellow precipitate which, when placed side by side with one produced by\r\nArsenious acid, cannot be distinguished by colour or appearance from\r\nit_. This fact has lately been announced by Dr. Porter of the University\r\nof South Carolina. (Silliman’s Journal, iii, 355.) But as the presence\r\nof chromate of potass can never be suspected in any research after\r\narsenic, in cases of forensic interest, the fact is of no importance to\r\nthe physician.\r\n\r\nWhere the Arsenious acid is mixed with vegetable matter, and it becomes\r\ndifficult to separate it by filtration, the whole may be evaporated to\r\ndryness, taking great care that the heat applied for such a purpose\r\nnever exceeds 250° _Fah:_ or we shall lose the arsenic by\r\nvolatilization. The residue thus obtained may then be submitted to a\r\nhigher temperature, in a subliming vessel, in order to procure the\r\narsenious acid in its pure state. Should the arsenious acid have, in the\r\nfirst instance, been dissolved in oil, Dr. Ure proposes to boil the\r\nsolution in distilled water, and to separate the oil afterwards by the\r\ncapillary action of wick threads. If the arsenious acid be mixed with\r\nresinous bodies, oil of turpentine may be employed as their solvent,\r\nwhich will leave the arsenic untouched. Dr. Black directed the\r\napplication of alcohol for this purpose, but this is obviously improper,\r\nsince arsenious acid is soluble in that fluid.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that, in consequence of the inability of arsenious\r\nacid to decompose nitrate of silver by simple elective attraction, the\r\npresence of an alkali becomes indispensable in the examination, for\r\nwhich purpose Dr. Marcet has suggested the superior advantages which\r\nwill attend the use of ammonia, in cases where the arsenic has not been\r\npreviously combined with a fixed alkali, since it does not, when added\r\nsingly, decompose nitrate of silver; a circumstance which in using the\r\nfixed alkalies is very liable to occasion fallacy. This led Mr. Hume to\r\nimprove his original plan, by forming at once a compound, which he calls\r\nthe _Ammoniaco-nitrate of silver_, but which may with more propriety be\r\ndesignated as an _Ammoniuret_.[415] This is a triumph in the art of\r\nanalysis; for whilst it obviates the necessity of ascertaining the exact\r\nproportion of alkali required in each experiment,[416] it possesses the\r\nvaluable property of not in the least disturbing the phosphate of soda.\r\n\r\n(B.) _Sulphate of Copper._ Like the preceding test, this also requires,\r\nfor its success, that the arsenious acid should be combined with some\r\nalkali, in which case, by the operation of double elective attraction,\r\nan arsenite of copper is thrown down of a very striking and\r\ncharacteristic colour, being that of the well-known pigment called\r\n_Scheele’s green_; if arsenic be not present in the liquid so assayed,\r\nand a fixed alkali has been employed, the result will be a delicate\r\n_sky-blue_, instead of the _grass-green_ precipitate.\r\n\r\nMr. Hume avails himself also of the peculiar property of ammonia to form\r\na metallic salt, and has employed it with copper: he takes the sulphate\r\nor acetate of that metal, and by the same process as that described for\r\nthe preparation of an ammoniuret of silver, forms another test. In using\r\nthis, however, care must be taken that it be not too highly\r\nconcentrated, for in that state it will not produce precipitation. Much\r\ncontroversy has taken place on the subject of sulphate of copper as a\r\ntest for arsenic, and it has been stated, with more confidence than\r\ntruth, that a _decoction of onions_ has the property of imparting to the\r\ncopper precipitate, which is produced by a fixed alkali, a colour and\r\nappearance analogous to that which is occasioned by arsenic. This\r\nopinion was boldly advanced and supported on a most important[417] trial\r\nat the Lent assizes for Cornwall in 1817. Since this event an\r\nopportunity[418] has occurred which has enabled me to examine this\r\nalleged fact, by a fair and appropriate series of experiments, the\r\nresult of which satisfactorily proved that the opinion was grounded on\r\nan optical fallacy, arising from the _blue_ precipitate assuming a\r\n_green_ colour, in consequence of having been viewed through a yellow\r\nmedium.[419] The phosphoric salts may also, under similar circumstances,\r\nbe mistaken for arsenic, for the intense blue colour of the phosphate of\r\ncopper will thus necessarily appear green. This instance of optical\r\nfallacy is not solitary, for _corrosive sublimate_ has been said to\r\npossess the character of an alkali, because it turns the syrup of\r\nviolets green, whereas this change is to be attributed solely to the\r\ncombination of the yellow hue of the sublimate with the blue colour of\r\nthe violet.\r\n\r\nWhenever therefore such a source of fallacy can be suspected, the\r\noperator would do well to repeat his experiment on white paper, in the\r\nmanner I have before proposed, and the results which are obtained in\r\nglasses should always be examined by day-light, and viewed by reflected\r\nand not by transmitted light. The presence of Peroxide of Iron in the\r\nCupreous salt will also impart a green colour to the precipitate\r\nproduced by an alkali. To obviate any fallacy which might arise from\r\nthis circumstance, Mr. Phillips proposes to add some pure Potass to the\r\nsulphate of copper; if pure, a fine blue precipitate will be thus\r\nobtained; to this may be then added the suspected solution, and if\r\nArsenious acid be present, it will then convert this blue precipitate to\r\na green one.\r\n\r\n(C.) _Sulphuretted Hydrogen._ This is a very delicate test for arsenic,\r\nproducing with its solution a beautiful golden coloured liquor, which\r\nafter a short time lets fall a precipitate. Mr. Phillips,[420] in\r\nreviewing the third edition of the present work, has stated, that no\r\nsuch precipitate occurs, but I find that in close, as well as in vessels\r\nexposed to the air, it takes place by repose. By this reagent, so small\r\na quantity as 1⁄000,000 may be detected in solution; and it may be also\r\nstated in farther proof of the utility of this test, that it is less\r\naffected than any other by the presence of animal or vegetable matter.\r\nThe method of preparing a solution of sulphuretted hydrogen gas is\r\nextremely simple. Put into an oil flask about two ounces of undiluted\r\nmuriatic acid and an ounce and a half of powdered Sulphuret of Antimony;\r\nfit a cork to the flask and pass through it the short leg of a small\r\nglass tube twice bent at right angles; pass the longer leg of the tube\r\ninto a phial containing distilled water, and then by the heat of a\r\nspirit lamp applied to the flask, sulphuretted hydrogen gas will be\r\nabundantly liberated, and though much of it will escape, yet a\r\nsufficient quantity will be dissolved by the water. The annexed sketch\r\nrepresents the apparatus proposed by Mr. Phillips, and which will\r\nrequire but little practical skill, either for its construction or use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut it is not always necessary to prepare a watery solution of\r\nSulphuretted Hydrogen, a stream of the gas, introduced into the\r\nsuspected liquor by means of the above apparatus, will act with equal\r\ndelicacy, and possesses, as Dr. Christison has observed, the advantage\r\nof not diluting it. Before applying this test, it is necessary to add an\r\nacid, if any alkali should exist along with the Arsenic, otherwise no\r\nprecipitate will take place.\r\n\r\n(D.) _Alkaline Hydro-sulphurets._ These bodies do not affect the\r\narsenious solution, unless a few drops of acetic acid be added. To the\r\n_Hydro-sulphuret_, or perhaps more properly, _Hydroguretted Sulphuret_,\r\nof Ammonia there is an insuperable objection, since this fluid, when\r\ndiluted, possesses the colour which we expect to produce by the action\r\nof Sulphuretted Hydrogen upon Arsenious Acid.\r\n\r\n(E.) _Charcoal Powder._ This test was proposed by Mr. A. Thomson,\r\n(London Dispensatory, 2nd edition, p. 53.) Into the suspected solution\r\nstir a moderate quantity of charcoal powder, allow it to settle, then\r\npour off the supernatant liquor, and when the powder which remains is\r\ndry, sprinkle some of it on a red hot poker, when, if the solution\r\nshould contain Arsenic, the odour of Garlic will be rendered sensible. I\r\nhave already offered some remarks upon the cause of this phenomenon\r\n(_page 304_.)\r\n\r\nThere are several other tests by which arsenic may be identified. The\r\nprocess described in the Dublin Pharmacopœia for the preparation of\r\n_Arsenias Kali_, the arseniate, or rather super-arseniate of potass,\r\nwhich has been long known under the name of “the arsenical salt of\r\nMacquer,” has been strongly advised as a collateral proof; it consists\r\nin decomposing the nitrate of potass[421] by the arsenious acid, but\r\nsince this problem requires that the suspected poison should be in a\r\nsolid and palpable form, it is impossible to examine its pretensions to\r\nour confidence, without being reminded of the story so often told to us\r\nin our infancy, of catching a bird by laying salt upon its tail.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to observe in this place, that the _arseniate_, like the\r\n_arsenite of potass_, or that of _ammonia_, is obedient to the silver\r\ntest, but that instead of the yellow precipitate which is produced by\r\nthe latter salt, we obtain, by the former, a red or brick-coloured one.\r\n\r\nIf arsenious acid and quick-lime be heated together in a glass tube, a\r\nsudden ignition is occasioned at a certain temperature, when metallic\r\narsenic will sublime, and an arseniate of lime be formed. In this case\r\none portion of the arsenious acid is robbed of its oxygen to complete\r\nthe acidification of the remainder.\r\n\r\nIn taking an impartial review of all the evidence which the\r\ninvestigation of this subject can furnish, it must appear to the most\r\nfastidious, that the silver and copper test above described are capable,\r\nunder proper management, of furnishing striking and infallible\r\nindications, and that in most cases they will be equally conclusive, and\r\nin some even more satisfactory in their results, than the metallic\r\nreproduction upon which such stress has been laid, and for this obvious\r\nreason, that unless the quantity of metal be considerable,[422] its\r\nmetallic splendour and appearance is often very ambiguous and\r\nquestionable. It has to my knowledge happened to a medical person, by no\r\nmeans deficient in chemical address, to ascribe to the presence of\r\narsenic that which was no other than a film of very finely divided\r\ncharcoal: in this state of doubt the last resource was to ascertain\r\nwhether it yielded, or not, upon being heated, an alliaceous odour.\r\nSurely an unprejudiced judge would prefer the evidence of sight, as\r\nfurnished by the arsenical tests, to that of smell, as afforded in the\r\nlast experiment. No one will attempt to deny that it is the duty of the\r\nmedical practitioner who is called upon to decide so important a\r\nquestion as the presence of arsenic, to prosecute by experiment every\r\npoint which admits the least doubt; he should also remember that in a\r\ncriminal case, he has not only to satisfy his own conscience, but that\r\nhe is bound, as far as he is able, to convince the public mind of the\r\naccuracy and truth of his researches; and he fails in his duty if he\r\nomits, through any false principle of humanity, to express the strong\r\nconviction which the success of his experiments must necessarily have\r\nproduced in his mind. Let it however be remembered, that the application\r\nof chemical reagents on solutions suspected to contain arsenic, so far\r\nfrom throwing any obstacle in the way of the metallic reduction of that\r\nbody, are the very steps which should be adopted as preparatory to the\r\n“_experimentum crucis_,” since the precipitates which are thus produced\r\nmay be collected, and easily decomposed, as before stated.

It fell however into total disrepute\r\nuntil its use was a few years since revived in France. Although it has\r\nattracted some attention lately, it can hardly be said to have reclaimed\r\na permanent place in the materia medica. The most striking effects which\r\nit produces on the system, are an increase of urine and perspiration. It\r\nhas been recommended in glandular swellings, gleets, schirrus of the\r\nuterus, scrofula, and dropsy. It is however as an antisyphilitic remedy\r\nthat it has been principally celebrated. According to Dr. Chrestien of\r\nMontpelier, it would appear that gold was not merely adequate to the\r\ncure of syphilis in all its forms, but that it possesses very great\r\nadvantages over mercury—It does not affect the gums, nor does it in any\r\nway disturb the general health of the patient. Notwithstanding this warm\r\nrecommendation of Dr. Chrestien, it is still doubtful whether gold is\r\nadequate to the cure of syphilis. The best form in which the gold can be\r\ngiven is that of the muriate, prepared according to the directions of\r\nthe Pharmacopœia of the United States; of this the dose is one fifteenth\r\nto one fourth of a grain, in pills, given every six, eight, or twelve\r\nhours.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      BALSAMUM PERUVIANUM.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nResin, volatile oil, and benzoic acid; it is therefore a true _balsam:_\r\nthis term was formerly applied to every vegetable resin having a strong\r\nscent and the fluidity of treacle, and which was supposed to possess\r\nmany medicinal virtues; it is now restricted to those resins which\r\ncontain the benzoic acid in their composition, of which there are only\r\nthree, viz. the Balsams of _Peru_, _Tolu_, and _Benzoin_. SOLUBILITY.\r\nWater when boiled upon it dissolves only a portion of benzoic acid;\r\næther is its most complete solvent; alcohol dissolves it completely, but\r\nthe quantity of this menstruum must be considerable. PROPERTIES,\r\nstimulant and tonic, on which account in certain chronic affections of\r\nthe lungs, it has been found a serviceable expectorant; Sydenham gave it\r\nin Phthisis, but wherever any inflammatory action is to be apprehended\r\nDr. Fothergill wisely cautions us against its use.

Volatile oil, resin, and benzoic acid. SOLUBILITY.\r\nIt is soluble in alcohol, forming a tincture which is rendered milky by\r\nwater, but no precipitate falls. When dissolved in the smallest quantity\r\nof a solution of potass, its odour is changed into one that resembles\r\nclove pink. MEDICINAL USES. It has been regarded as expectorant. In\r\nturning to the classification of expectorants, p. 102, it will be found\r\nto occupy a place in the second division of our first class, for it may\r\nbe considered as capable of stimulating the pulmonary exhalants; whence\r\nits use in chronic coughs. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may be suspended in\r\nwater by means of mucilage, or yolk of egg, but it is rarely employed\r\nexcept on account of its agreeable flavour;[424] its virtues are similar\r\nto those of the balsam of Peru.

The leaves are inodorous. _Taste_, slightly nauseous,\r\nsweetish, and sub-acrid; their peculiar properties are not lost by\r\ndrying. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Vauquelin found that the leaves contained\r\na substance analogous to albumen, salts with a base of potass, and a\r\nbitter principle on which its narcotic properties depended, and more\r\nlately the presence of an alkaline element has been detected, which has\r\nreceived the appellation of _Atropia_, the sulphate of which\r\ncrystallizes very beautifully. SOLUBILITY. Water is the most powerful\r\nsolvent of its active matter. USES. It is a powerful sedative and\r\nnarcotic, both as an internal medicine and as an external application;\r\nin this latter form, it alleviates local pains very effectually, but is\r\nliable to affect the nervous system. The recent leaves powdered, and\r\nmade into an ointment with an equal weight of lard will be found an\r\nefficient form for many purposes; rubbed over the penis it prevents\r\npriapism and relieves chordee more effectually than any application\r\nwhich has been proposed. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. Every part of the plant is\r\npoisonous, and the berries from their beautiful appearance have often\r\ntempted the unwary; the leaves however furnish the most convenient and\r\npowerful form of exhibition; externally, they may be used as a poultice,\r\ninternally, one grain of the dry leaves powdered, and gradually\r\nincreased to 10 or 12 grains, or the leaves may be infused in boiling\r\nwater in the proportion of four grains to two fluid-ounces, which may be\r\ngiven as a dose. A little of this infusion dropped into the eye\r\npermanently dilates the pupil, for which intention it has been\r\nsuccessfully applied previous to an operation for the cataract. The\r\nextract of this plant, since its active principle is fixed, ought to\r\npossess activity, but as it occurs in commerce it is found to be very\r\nuncertain and variable, a circumstance which entirely depends upon the\r\nmanner in which it has been prepared.[426] See _Extractum Belladonnæ_.\r\nAn overdose of belladonna produces the most distressing and alarming\r\nsymptoms, and so paralyzing is its influence, that vomiting can be\r\nhardly excited by the strongest doses of tartarized antimony; in such\r\ncases vinegar will be found the best antidote, or the affusion of cold\r\nwater over the surface of the body, after the application of which,\r\nemetics are more likely to perform their duty, for physiological reasons\r\nexplained in p. 85.

It is insoluble in water and dilute\r\nacids, but is dissolved by the concentrated acids, and is again\r\nprecipitated by water. The alkalies, Potass and Soda, also dissolve it,\r\nbut sparingly; it is more soluble in ammonia. USES. It was formerly\r\nemployed as a cosmetic, under the name of _Magistery of Bismuth_, or\r\nthat of _Pearl White_;[429] since, however, it becomes black from the\r\noperation of Sulphuretted Hydrogen and its compounds,[430] much\r\ninconvenience attends its application. Its medicinal powers appear to\r\nhave been first noticed by Jacobi,[431] but the remedy attracted little\r\nor no attention until the publication of a paper upon the subject by\r\nOdier[432] of Geneva. The diseases in which its powers as a tonic have\r\nbeen more particularly displayed, are Gastrodynia, Pyrosis, and\r\nDyspepsia attended with cholic. Dr. Marcet in a paper read in 1801\r\nbefore the Medico-chirurgical Society of London, says, “I have had\r\nfrequent opportunities of trying the oxide of Bismuth in spasmodic\r\naffections of the stomach in Guy’s Hospital, and those trials have fully\r\nconfirmed the opinion which I formerly gave of the utility of this\r\nmedicine.” The practitioner will receive a further confirmation of its\r\nvalue by referring to Dr. Bradsley’s Medical Reports: and Dr. Yeats has\r\npublished in the Royal Institution Journal[433] a striking case\r\nillustrative of its efficacy.[434] Dose, gr. v to xv, in the form of\r\npills.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         BISTORTÆ RADIX.

One part\r\nof gum, (_Cerasin_,) and four parts of a brittle resin; but this\r\nknowledge throws no light on the nature of its cathartic property.\r\nSOLUBILITY. When triturated with water two-thirds of its substance are\r\nspeedily dissolved, and a turbid solution results; alcohol dissolves\r\nnine-tenths, and forms a yellow transparent tincture, which is rendered\r\nturbid by the addition of water; sulphuric ether dissolves six-tenths of\r\nthe substance; it is also soluble in alkaline solutions, and the\r\nresulting compound is not rendered turbid by water, but is instantly\r\ndecomposed by acids, and the precipitate so produced is of an extremely\r\nbrilliant yellow colour, and soluble in an excess of acid. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. No bodies appear to produce in gamboge such a chemical\r\nchange as to destroy the chemical properties which distinguish it, but\r\nby a mechanical admixture, its solubility and consequently its\r\noperation, may be materially modified. Dr. Cullen found that the\r\ninconvenience arising from its too rapid solubility, and sudden\r\nimpression upon the stomach, might be obviated by diminishing the dose,\r\nand repeating it at short intervals as directed in _Form: 89_.

(_Laurus Camphora._[437])\r\n\r\n                                Camphor.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a white brittle substance, unctuous to the touch, but\r\npossessing at the same time a degree of ductility which prevents its\r\nbeing easily pulverised, unless a few drops of spirit be previously\r\nadded. It is capable of affecting a crystalline form.[438] _Odour_,\r\npeculiar, fragrant, and penetrating. _Taste_, bitter, pungent, and\r\naromatic. _Specific gravity_, ·9887, it therefore swims on water; it is\r\nso volatile that during warm weather a considerable proportion will\r\nevaporate, especially if at the same time the atmosphere be rather\r\nmoist, for the reason stated in page 175. It is readily ignited, and\r\nburns with a brilliant flame and much smoke; it melts at 288°, and boils\r\nat 400. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a proximate vegetable principle,\r\nresembling the essential oils in many of its habitudes, and probably\r\ndiffers from them in composition only in containing a larger proportion\r\nof carbon. SOLUBILITY. Water may be said to dissolve about a nine\r\nhundredth part of its weight, or f℥j rather more than gr. ½, but its\r\nsolvent power is considerably increased by the addition of carbonic acid\r\ngas; camphor is also rendered more soluble by trituration with magnesia;\r\nit is soluble in an equal weight of alcohol, but it is again separated\r\nby the addition of water; it is also dissolved by oils, both fixed and\r\nvolatile,[439] especially if their temperature be a little raised, and\r\nby sulphuric and other æthers, but strong acetic acid may be said to be\r\nits most powerful solvent. By repeatedly distilling it with nitric acid\r\nit is converted into _Camphoric acid_, an acid distinguished by peculiar\r\nproperties, and composing, with alkalies and earths, a class of salts\r\ncalled _Camphorates_, but which do not possess any medicinal value. The\r\nalkalies do not produce any effect upon camphor. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. It is not affected by any substance with which we can\r\ncombine it. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It is preferable in the form of\r\nmixture, since it is very liable in the solid state to excite nausea,\r\nand, from swimming on the contents of the stomach, to occasion pain at\r\nits upper orifice. If a larger dose be required than that which water\r\ncan dissolve, an additional proportion may be suspended by means of\r\nsugar, almonds, yelk of egg, or mucilage, for which purpose three times\r\nits weight of gum arabic is required. If Camphor be first dissolved by\r\ntrituration in a very small portion of oil, it readily mixes with\r\nmucilage of gum arabic, and may then be conveniently blended with\r\nliquids. It has also the property of uniting with gum-resins, and of\r\nconverting them into permanently soft, and uniform masses; hence they\r\nmay sometimes be conveniently applied for diffusing it in water. It may\r\nbe formed into pill-masses by stiff mucilage, fœtid gums, or by a\r\nconfection. MEDICINAL USES. In moderate doses it exhilarates, without\r\nraising the pulse, and gives a tendency to diaphoresis; and under\r\ncertain conditions of the body, when opium fails, it will frequently\r\npromote sleep. As its effects are transient, its dose should be repeated\r\nat short intervals. _Illustrative Formulæ_ 1, 6, 21, 125, 134, 164.\r\nCamphor is said to correct the bad effects of opium, mezereon,\r\ncantharides, and the drastic purgatives, and diuretics. DOSE, gr. ij to\r\n℈j.

They are collected\r\nfrom the leaves of the different trees on which they delight to dwell,\r\nin June and July, and are afterwards destroyed, as recommended by\r\nDioscorides, by the fumes of strong vinegar, and dried in the sun. The\r\nchemical history of Cantharides is still involved in some obscurity; the\r\nblistering principle has been obtained by Robiquet in a separate state,\r\nwhen it assumes the form of small crystalline plates, having a micaceous\r\nlustre, not unlike spermaceti; Dr. Thomson has given to it the name of\r\n_Cantharidin_;[441] when pure, it is insoluble in water and in cold\r\nalcohol; boiling alcohol, however, dissolves it, but precipitates it\r\nagain on being cooled. Æther and the oils dissolve it readily. Although\r\nnot soluble in water it is rendered so by the presence of a yellow\r\nmatter which exists in native combination with it. A very minute portion\r\nof this substance dissolved in sweet oil, and applied to the skin with a\r\npiece of paper, produces vesication in five or six hours. In addition to\r\nthis active principle, Cantharides contain a green concrete oil; a\r\nyellow fluid oil; a peculiar black substance soluble in water and proof\r\nspirit, but not in pure alcohol; a saponaceous or yellow substance,\r\nsoluble both in water and alcohol; Uric acid; Acetic acid; Phosphate of\r\nMagnesia, and a parenchymatous substance.[442] MEDICINAL USES.\r\nCantharides, when administered internally, are powerfully stimulant and\r\ndiuretic;[443] and whether applied as a vesicatory to the skin, or taken\r\ninto the stomach, they have a peculiar tendency to act upon the urinary\r\norgans, and especially to irritate and inflame the neck of the bladder,\r\nand occasion strangury. On this account they have been very successfully\r\nemployed both for the cure of incontinence of urine, and suppression of\r\nthis discharge, from torpor or paralysis of the bladder; they have also\r\nbeen used in gleet and leucorrhæa, and in cases of seminal weakness and\r\nimpotence. In consulting the works of Dioscorides, Galen, and Pliny, we\r\nshall find they entertained a notion, that the _virus_ existed only in\r\nthe body of the fly, and that the head, feet and wings, contained its\r\nantidote! Hippocrates prescribed them internally in Dropsy, Jaundice,\r\nand Amenorrhœa; and yet in the end of the sixteenth century, Dr.\r\nGroenvelt was charged and sued[444] for giving them inwardly, in\r\nsubstance, for the cure of the stone. DOSE, in substance, not exceeding\r\ngr. i, combined with opium or hyoscyamus. See _Tinctura: Cantharid_. A\r\nstrong decoction of the Cantharides in Oil of Turpentine furnishes a\r\nmost powerful Epispastic, and may be easily applied by means of dossils\r\nof lint. As the general belief, which exists with respect to the\r\naphrodisiac powers of this substance, may induce persons to try its\r\nefficacy in large doses, either for goading the exertions of exhausted\r\nnature, or for incensing the passions of females whose seduction is\r\nmeditated, it behoves the medical practitioner to become acquainted with\r\nthe symptoms which it may produce, and of which the following may be\r\nconsidered as the most prominent;—violent retching; copious alvine\r\nevacuations, frequently bloody; very severe colics; active inflammation\r\nof the stomach and intestines; sometimes universal convulsions, attended\r\nwith a horror of liquids, resembling that which occurs in hydrophobia;\r\nfurious delirium, &c. But the affections of the urinary passages, and\r\norgans of generation, may be regarded κατεξοχην, as the peculiar\r\nsymptoms of poisoning by Cantharides; such as heat in the bladder,\r\nbloody micturition, horrible strangury, painful and obstinate priapism,\r\n_satyriasis_, &c. The method of treatment to be pursued on such\r\noccasions will consist in copious bleeding, warm bath, local\r\nfomentations, mild and mucilaginous drinks; and opium, especially in the\r\nform of clyster or suppository.

SOLUBILITY. Its qualities are partially\r\nextracted by water, but more completely by æther and spirit. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Cinchonia, resin, mucilage, and an acrid principle said to\r\nbe alkaline.[446] INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.

MEDICINAL USES. It is a most powerful stimulant to the\r\nstomach, and is unaccompanied with any narcotic effect; as a gargle in\r\ncynanche maligna, and in relaxed states of the throat, it furnishes a\r\nvaluable remedy; combined with purgatives, it proves serviceable in\r\ndyspepsia, (_Form: 78_,) it has lately been given with success in the\r\nadvanced stages of acute rheumatism; in various diseases attended with\r\ncold feet, it has been recommended to wear socks dusted with Cayenne\r\nPepper. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may be given, made into pills with crumb\r\nof bread, or in the form of tincture, diluted with water; for the\r\npurpose of a gargle, a simple infusion in the proportion of gr. j to f℥j\r\nof boiling water, or fʒvi of the tincture to f℥viij of the _Infusum\r\nRosæ_, may be directed.

Cayenne pepper is generally mixed with _muriate of soda_,\r\nwhich disposes it to deliquesce. _Red Lead_ may be detected by digesting\r\nit in acetic acid, and adding to the solution sulphuret of ammonia,\r\nwhich will produce, if any lead be present, a dark coloured precipitate;\r\nor the fraud may be discovered by boiling some of the suspected pepper\r\nin vinegar, and after filtering the solution adding to it sulphate of\r\nsoda, when a white precipitate will be formed, which, after being dried\r\nand exposed to heat, and mixed with a little charcoal, will yield a\r\nmetallic globule of lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    CARBO LIGNI. L.E.D. _Charcoal._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. It is a black, inodorous, insipid, brittle substance; when\r\nnewly prepared it possesses the property of absorbing very considerable\r\nquantities of the different gases; it is also capable of destroying the\r\nsmell and taste of a variety of vegetable and animal substances,\r\nespecially of mucilages, oils, and of matter in which _extractive_\r\nabounds; and some medicines are said to be even deprived of their\r\ncharacteristic odour by remaining in contact with it, as Valerian,\r\nGalbanum, Balsam of Peru, and Musk. The use of charring the interior of\r\nwater casks, and of wrapping charcoal in cloths that have acquired a bad\r\nsmell, depends upon this property; for the same reason it furnishes a\r\nvery excellent tooth powder,[448] for which purpose, that which is\r\nobtained from the shell of the cocoa nut is to be preferred. None of the\r\nfluid menstrua with which we are acquainted have any action whatever as\r\nsolvents upon carbon.[449] MEDICINAL USES. It is antiseptic, and has\r\nbeen administered internally, to correct the putrid eructations which\r\nsometimes attend dyspepsia, but in order to produce this effect it\r\nshould be newly prepared, or such as has been preserved from the access\r\nof air, for it operates by absorbing the putrid gas, as well as by\r\nchecking the decomposition of the undigested element.[450] DOSE, grs. x\r\nto ʒj. It has been lately asserted to possess powers as an antidote to\r\narsenic; if this be true, its action can only be mechanical by absorbing\r\nlike a sponge the arsenical solution, and thereby defending the coats of\r\nthe stomach from its virulence.[451] Charcoal, when mixed with boiled\r\nbread, forms a very valuable poultice for foul and gangrenous sores. In\r\na state of impalpable powder, it is said to be effectual as a styptic;\r\nDr. Odier informs us that the celebrated _powder of Faynard_, for\r\nstopping hemorrhage, was nothing more than the charcoal of beech-wood\r\nfinely powdered.\r\n\r\nCharcoal is prepared for the purposes of medicine and the arts, from a\r\nvariety of substances, viz.\r\n\r\nBURNT SPONGE. _Spongia Usta._ L. Consists of charcoal with portions of\r\nphosphate and carbonate of lime, and sub-carbonate of soda; it has been\r\nhighly commended in bronchocele and scrophulous complaints, in the form\r\nof an electuary, or in that of a lozenge, and it has been lately\r\nasserted that it owes its power to the presence of Iodine.\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE ÆTHIOPS. _Pulvis Quercus marinæ._ From the _fucus\r\nvesiculosus_, or bladder-wrack, used as the preceding.\r\n\r\nIVORY BLACK. _Ebur Ustum._ From ivory shavings burned; used as a\r\ndentifrice and a pigment, under the name of “_blue-black_,” for its hue\r\nis bluish; but bone-black is usually sold for it.\r\n\r\nLAMP BLACK. _Fuligo Lampadum._ By burning resinous bodies, as the refuse\r\nof pitch, in furnaces of a peculiar construction.\r\n\r\nWOOD SOOT. _Fuligo ligni_, collected from chimnies under which wood is\r\nburnt.

Calyx, D. _Cloves._\r\n\r\nCloves are the unexpanded flowers, or flower-buds, of the clove tree,\r\nwhich are first obtained when the tree is six years old; they are\r\ngathered in October and November before they open, and when they are\r\nstill green; and are dried in the sun, after having been exposed to\r\nsmoke at a heat of 120°, till they assume a brown hue. It is a curious\r\nfact that the flowers when fully developed are quite inodorous, and that\r\nthe real fruit is not in the least aromatic. QUALITIES. _Form_, that of\r\na nail, consisting of a globular head, formed of the four petals of the\r\ncorolla, and four leaves of the calyx not yet expanded; and a germen\r\nsituated below nearly cylindrical, and scarcely an inch in length.\r\n_Odour_, strong, fragrant, and aromatic. _Taste_, acrid, aromatic and\r\npermanent. Benzoic acid has lately been discovered in them.\r\n\r\nSOLUBILITY. Water extracts their odour, but little of their taste;\r\nalcohol and ether take up both completely. MEDICINAL USES.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Mucilage,\r\nbitter extractive, resin, volatile oil, and a large proportion of woody\r\nfibre; neither _Cinchonia_ nor _Quina_ has hitherto been discovered in\r\nit. SOLUBILITY. Its active constituents are partially extracted by\r\nalcohol and water, and completely by proof spirit. MEDICINAL USES.\r\nCarminative and tonic; it is an excellent adjunct to cinchona, rendering\r\nit by its aromatic qualities more agreeable to the stomach, and\r\nincreasing its powers. It is valuable in dyspepsia and flatulent cholic,\r\nin dysentery and diarrhœa, and in the gangrenous thrush peculiar to\r\nchildren. FORMS OF EXHIBITION.

It contains also, according to the analysis\r\nof Laugier, a small quantity of Benzoic acid. The Canadian variety is\r\nalso stated by Laugier to contain benzoic acid both free and combined.\r\nSOLUBILITY. Its active matter is dissolved by alcohol, proof spirit, and\r\npartially by water; the tincture made with alcohol is the least\r\nnauseous, and the most efficacious; the spirit of ammonia is also an\r\nexcellent menstruum, and in many cases improves its virtues.

Its astringency is destroyed by alkaline salts;\r\nand precipitates are produced by metallic salts, especially by those of\r\niron; and with gelatine it forms an insoluble compound. MEDICINAL USES.\r\nIt is a most valuable astringent. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In infusion,\r\ntincture, or powder. (_Form. 51, 52, 58, 151._) In the form of a\r\nlozenge, from its gradual solution, it may be very advantageously\r\napplied in relaxed states of the uvula and fauces; I have found this\r\nremedy successful in cases where the _sulphate of zinc_ was inefficient.\r\nFrom its great astringency it also forms an excellent dentifrice,\r\nespecially when the gums are spongy; for this purpose I have employed\r\nequal parts of powdered catechu, and Peruvian bark, with one-fourth the\r\nquantity of the powder of myrrh.

It entered into the composition of the once\r\ncelebrated _Portland Powder_ for the gout, for an account of which see\r\npage 32.

L.E.D. _Wax._\r\n\r\n It is admitted into the list of the Materia Medica under two forms, viz.\r\n\r\n                1. CERA FLAVA. _Yellow or Unbleached Wax._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, faintly honey-like; it is brittle yet soft; when\r\nchewed, it does not, if pure, adhere to the teeth; it melts at 142°, and\r\nburns entirely away. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is the honey-comb of the\r\nbee melted with boiling water, pressed through cloth bags, and\r\nultimately cast into round cakes for the market. Whether it be an animal\r\nproduct, or a vegetable substance merely collected by the bee, has been\r\na question of dispute; the former opinion is probably correct, although\r\nwax is certainly produced as a secretion by many plants. The yellow wax\r\ncontains a portion of pollen which imparts its colour to it, and\r\nincreases its fusibility. SOLUBILITY. It is insoluble in water, and in\r\ncold alcohol or ether, but it is soluble in boiling alcohol and ether,\r\nin fixed oils, and in alkalies. USES. It is chiefly employed in the\r\ncomposition of external applications. ADULTERATIONS. _Earth_ or\r\n_peas-meal_ may be suspected when the cake is very brittle, and the\r\ncolour inclines to grey; _Resin_ is detected by putting it in cold\r\nalcohol, which will dissolve the resinous part without acting on the\r\nwax. _Tallow_ is discovered by the greater softness and unctuosity of\r\nthe cake, and by its suffocating smell when melted; when this latter\r\nsubstance is employed, turmeric is added to disguise its paleness.\r\n\r\n2. CERA ALBA. _White, Bleached, or Virgin’s Wax._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This substance differs only from the former, in being\r\ncolourless, harder, heavier, and less fusible. USES. It is said to be\r\ndemulcent, and very useful in dysentery, but it is rarely used. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. It may be formed into a mixture by melting it with one-third\r\nof its weight of soap, and then gradually adding to it any mucilaginous\r\nliquid. ADULTERATIONS. _White Lead_ may be detected by melting the wax\r\nin water, when the oxide will fall to the bottom of the vessel; _tallow_\r\nmay be suspected when the cake wants its usual translucency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         CERATA. L.E. Cerates.\r\n\r\nThese compositions are characterized by a degree of consistence,\r\nintermediate between that of plasters, and that of ointments. As this\r\nconsistence is obtained from the wax which they contain, they very\r\nproperly derive from that substance the generic appellation of\r\n_Cerates_.\r\n\r\nCERATUM CALAMINÆ. L. (_Ceratum lapidis Calaminaris._ P.L. 1787. _Ceratum\r\nepuloticum. P.L._ 1745). Ceratum Carbonatis Zinci Impuri. E. Unguentum\r\nCalaminare. D.—These preparations have been long known under the name of\r\n_Turner’s Cerate_; they form the basis of many extemporaneous cerates,\r\nin some of which nitric oxide of mercury, in the proportion of ʒj of the\r\noxide to ℥j of cerate, and in others, the liquor of sub-acetate of lead,\r\nare introduced. By the former combination we obtain a very useful\r\napplication to indolent and ill-conditioned ulcers, a valuable stimulant\r\nfor inducing an action conducive to the regeneration of parts. By the\r\nlatter combination we derive a remedy highly extolled by our most\r\nexperienced surgeons, in the cure of burns and scalds.\r\n\r\nCERATUM CANTHARIDIS. L. The basis of this preparation is spermaceti\r\ncerate _six parts_, to which is added, of powdered flies _one part:_ as\r\nit is intended to promote a purulent discharge from a blistered surface,\r\nit may be reduced in strength according to circumstances.\r\n\r\nCERATUM CETACEI. L. (_Ceratum Spermatis ceti. P.L._ 1787. Ceratum Album,\r\nP.L. 1745). Ceratum Simplex. E. It furnishes a soft and cooling\r\ndressing, and constitutes a convenient basis for more active\r\ncombinations, as in the following instance.\r\n\r\nCERATUM PLUMBI ACETATIS. L. (_Unguentum Cerussæ Acetatæ, P.L._ 1787.)\r\nThis is cooling for burns, excoriations, and inflamed surfaces.\r\n\r\nCERATUM PLUMBI COMPOSITUM. L. (_Cerat: Lithargyri acetati compositum.\r\nP.L._ 1787.) This is “_Goulard’s Cerate_” and is applicable to the same\r\ncases as the former cerate; the camphor which enters into its\r\ncomposition imparts a gently stimulating power to it; it proves\r\nextremely serviceable in chronic opthalmia of the tarsus, and for the\r\nincreased secretion of tears, which so frequently affects the eyes of\r\npersons advanced in years.\r\n\r\nCERATUM RESINÆ. L. (_Ceratum resinæ flavæ, P.L._ 1787. _Ceratum\r\ncitrinum._ 1745. _Yellow Basilicon_). Unguent: Resinosum, E. Unguent:\r\nResinæ albæ. D. It is stimulant, digestive, and cleansing, and affords a\r\nvery excellent application for foul and indolent ulcers.\r\n\r\nCERATUM SABINÆ. L. _Savine Cerate._ It is intended to keep up a purulent\r\ndischarge from a blistered surface; in practice however it is often\r\nfound to fail from the difficulty of obtaining it good, since the acrid\r\nprinciple of the plant is injured by long boiling, and by being\r\npreviously dried; the ointment also loses its virtue by exposure to the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nCERATUM SAPONIS. L. This preparation was much used and recommended by\r\nthe late Mr. Pott; in preparing it the greatest possible caution is\r\nrequired; the fire should never be too rapidly applied, the stirring\r\nshould be uniform and incessant, and the heat should only be sufficient\r\nto keep the two compositions liquid at the time when they are united.\r\nThe original intention of the cerate was to afford, when spread upon\r\nlinen, a mechanical support to fractured limbs, and to keep the points\r\nof the bone in due apposition, while in consequence of the _acetate of\r\nlead_ which is formed in the first stage of the process for its\r\npreparation, it possesses the virtues of a saturnine dressing. As a\r\nmechanical agent it may prove at once effectual and dangerous, for if it\r\nbe applied before all inflammation and swelling have entirely\r\ndisappeared, the inflamed vessels may be completely strangulated by its\r\nunrelenting pressure, and high erysipelatous inflammation, and a rapid\r\nstate of gangrene may be the result.\r\n\r\nCERATUM SIMPLEX. A useful application to excoriations and sores.\r\n\r\nBesides the above cerates, there are many magistral[458] preparations,\r\nof great practical value, and I must refer the surgical student for an\r\naccount of them to that very useful little manual, entitled\r\n“_Pharmacopœia Chirurgica_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CETACEUM. L.\r\n\r\n           (Physeter Macrocephalus, _Concretum sui generis_.)\r\n\r\n                            Spermaceti. E.D.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, flakes, which are unctuous, friable, and white.\r\n_Odour_ and _taste_, scarcely perceptible. _Sp. Grav._ 9·433. It melts\r\nat 112°. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a peculiar modification of fatty\r\nmatter. SOLUBILITY. It is insoluble in water and cold alcohol, but\r\nsoluble in hot alcohol, ether, and oil of turpentine, but it concretes\r\nagain as the fluids cool; in the fixed oils it is completely soluble.\r\nThe alkaline carbonates do not affect it, but it is partially dissolved\r\nin the pure alkalies, and with hot ammonia it forms an emulsion which is\r\nnot decomposed on cooling. USES. It is demulcent and emollient, but it\r\npossesses no advantages over the bland oils. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may\r\nbe suspended in water by means of mucilage or yolk of egg.

L.E.D. _Bark._ _Peruvian Bark._\r\n\r\n                            _Jesuit’s Bark._\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the labours of the Spanish botanists, the history of\r\nthis important genus is still involved in considerable perplexity, and\r\nowing to the mixture of the barks of several species,[459] and their\r\nimportation into Europe under one common name, it is extremely difficult\r\nto reconcile the contradictory opinions which exist upon the subject,\r\nnor indeed would such an investigation be consistent with the plan and\r\nobjects of this work. Under the trivial name _officinalis_, Linnæus\r\nconfounded no less than four distinct species of cinchona, and under the\r\nsame denomination the British Pharmacopœias, for a long period, placed\r\nas varieties the three barks known in the shops; this error indeed is\r\nstill maintained in the Dublin Pharmacopœias, but the London and\r\nEdinburgh colleges have at length adopted the arrangement of Mutis, a\r\ncelebrated botanist, who has resided in South America, and held the\r\nofficial situation of Director of the exportation of bark for nearly\r\nforty years.\r\n\r\nCINCHONÆ CORDIFOLIÆ CORTEX. L.E. Cortex Peruvianus. D. Heart-leaved\r\nCinchona Bark, commonly called _Yellow_ Bark.\r\n\r\nCINCHONÆ LANCIFOLIÆ CORTEX. L.E. Cortex Peruvianus. D. Lance-leaved\r\nCinchona Bark, common _Quilled_ bark—_Pale_ bark.\r\n\r\nCINCHONÆ OBLONGIFOLIÆ CORTEX. L.E. Cortex Peruvianus. D. Oblong-leaved\r\nCinchona Bark, called _Red_ bark.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. The _odour_ and _taste_ of these three species are\r\nessentially the same, although they differ in intensity. They are all\r\nbitter, sub-astringent and aromatic, but the flavour of the _Yellow_\r\nbark is incomparably the most bitter, although less austere and\r\nastringent, whilst the red bark has a taste much less bitter, but more\r\naustere and nauseous than either of the other species. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Few vegetable substances have been more frequently, or more\r\nably submitted to chemical analysis than the Peruvian bark, and yet but\r\nfew results of any great practical utility had been obtained previous to\r\nthe recent experiments of Pelletier and Caventou, communicated to the\r\nAcademy of Sciences at Paris, since the publication of the fourth\r\nedition of the present work.\r\n\r\nDr. Maton[460] had several years ago observed, that an infusion of\r\nnutgalls produced a precipitate with the decoctions of Bark; a fact\r\nwhich necessarily produced considerable speculation. Seguin was induced\r\nto regard it as arising from the presence of _gelatine_, (_see p. 56_,)\r\nan opinion which Dr. Duncan proved to be erroneous, and shewed that it\r\ndepended upon a new proximate principle, to which M. Gomez of Lisbon had\r\npreviously assigned the name of _Cinchonine_. Besides which, bark was\r\nconsidered as containing resin, extractive, gluten, tannin, a small\r\nportion of volatile oil, and some salts with a base of lime; one of\r\nwhich however had been only found in _Yellow_ bark, and had been\r\ndiscovered to contain a peculiar vegetable acid, denominated by\r\nVauquelin _Kinic_, a name which Dr. Duncan very judiciously superseded\r\nby that of _Cinchonic_ acid.\r\n\r\nIn the _Red_ bark, Fourcroy detected also a portion of citric acid, some\r\nmuriate of ammonia, and muriate of lime. Upon which of these principles\r\nthe tonic and febrifuge virtues of bark depends, has ever proved a\r\nfruitful source of controversy. Deschamps attributed them to _Cinchonate\r\nof Lime_, and asserted that two doses of thirty-six grains each, would\r\ncure any intermittent. Westering considered _Tannin_ as the active\r\nconstituent; while M. Seguin assigned all the virtues to the principle\r\nwhich precipitates gallic acid, and which, as it has been before stated,\r\nhe mistook for gelatine. Fabroni concluded from his experiments, that\r\nthe febrifuge power of the bark did not belong exclusively and\r\nessentially to the astringent, bitter, or to any other individual\r\nprinciple, since the quantity of these would necessarily be increased by\r\nlong boiling, whereas the virtues of the bark are notoriously diminished\r\nby protracted ebullition. This argument however will not go far, when we\r\nconsider the chemical changes which the liquid is known to suffer during\r\nthat operation, and by which a considerable portion of its matter is\r\nrendered insoluble. Such was the state of our knowledge respecting the\r\ncomposition of the _Cinchona_, when Pelletier and Caventou, guided by\r\nanalogy, were led to infer the presence of an alkaline element of\r\nactivity in its composition. The merit, belonging to the researches of\r\nthese eminent chemists, does not so much consist in the discovery of new\r\nelements, as in the proofs which they have furnished of the well known\r\nprinciple, _Cinchonine_, being a salifiable base,[461] and in\r\ndemonstrating the peculiar states of combination in which it exists in\r\nthe different species of Cinchona.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       1. _Cinchona Lancifolia._\r\n\r\nTheir analysis of the _Pale Bark_, furnished the following principles.\r\n\r\n  1. _Acidulous Kinate of Cinchonia._[462]\r\n\r\n  2. _A green fatty matter._\r\n\r\n  3. _Red Colouring matter, slightly soluble._\r\n\r\n  4. _Ditto soluble._ (Tannin.)\r\n\r\n  5. _Yellow colouring matter._\r\n\r\n  6. _Kinate of Lime._\r\n\r\n  7. _Gum._\r\n\r\n  8. _Starch._\r\n\r\n  9. _Lignin._\r\n\r\n_Cinchonia_, when obtained in an isolated form,[463] is distinguished by\r\nthe following characters and habitudes.\r\n\r\nIt is white, transparent, and crystallizes in the form of needles; it\r\nhas but little taste, circumstance depending upon its comparative\r\ninsolubility, as it requires no less than 7000 parts of cold water for\r\nits solution; in boiling water it is soluble in 2500 times its weight,\r\nbut a considerable part separates, on cooling. In alcohol and the acids\r\nit is much more soluble, and imparts to such menstrua the characteristic\r\nbitter of the bark; it dissolves only in small quantities in the fixed\r\nand volatile oils, or in sulphuric ether. Cinchonia restores the colour\r\nof litmus which has been reddened by an acid. With acids it combines and\r\nforms neutral salts, of which the solubility and crystalline form vary\r\nwith the acid employed.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Cinchonia_, easily crystallizable and moderately soluble,\r\nhas been found to consist of _Cinchonia_ 100, _Sulphuric acid_ 13·02.\r\n\r\n_Nitrate of Cinchonia_, uncrystallizable, and sparingly soluble.\r\n\r\n_Muriate of Cinchonia_, crystallizes in very beautiful needles, and is\r\nmore soluble than the preceding salts.\r\n\r\n_Oxalate of Cinchonia_, nearly insoluble; hence by pouring oxalic acid,\r\nor oxalate of ammonia into solutions of any of the soluble salts of\r\ncinchonia, we obtain a very white and abundant precipitate, which might\r\nbe mistaken for oxalate of lime; it is however soluble in an excess of\r\nacid, and in alcohol.\r\n\r\n_Gallate of Cinchonia_, equally as insoluble as the _Oxalate_, whence\r\nthe precipitate occasioned by pouring an infusion of galls into the\r\ndecoctions of genuine cinchona.\r\n\r\nCinchonia, when heated, does not fuse before decomposition. Its ultimate\r\nelements are _oxygen_, _hydrogen_, and _carbon_; the latter being\r\npredominant.\r\n\r\nThe _Kinic acid_, which exists in native combination with the\r\n_Cinchonia_, amongst several other peculiar properties, is convertible\r\nby means of heat into a substance (_acide pyrokinique_,) which is\r\ncrystallizable, and capable of producing with iron a most beautiful\r\ngreen colour.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. _Cinchona Cordifolia._\r\n\r\nIn the _Yellow Bark_, these chemists discovered also a salifiable base,\r\nquite distinct however in its character and habitudes from _Cinchonia_;\r\nthey accordingly have designated it by another name, viz. _Quinine_, but\r\nwhich we shall hereafter call _Quina_. In speaking of these two bases,\r\nthe authors compare them, in point of dissimilarity, to the fixed\r\nalkalies, potass and soda. _Quina_ is distinguished from _Cinchonia_ by\r\nthe following characters. It cannot, like this latter body, be\r\ncrystallized by evaporation from its alcoholic solution, although it may\r\nbe obtained in transparent plates. _It is very soluble in æther_; in\r\nwater it is as insoluble as cinchonia, but its taste is much more\r\nbitter. The salts which it forms are different from those of cinchonia,\r\nboth in the proportion of their elements, and in the properties which\r\nthey possess, being generally much more bitter. In comparing their\r\ncomposition, _Quina_ will appear to have less capacity of\r\nsaturation[464] than cinchonia.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Quina._ It forms crystals quite remarkable for their\r\nsatin-like and pearly lustre. It is soluble in cold water, a property\r\nwhich is very considerably increased by an excess of acid.[465] It\r\nappears from the observations of M. Callaude, apothecary at Annecy, that\r\n_Sulphate of Quina_ exposed to a gentle heat, becomes highly luminous;\r\nand M. Pelletier has since found that _Sulphate of Cinchonia_, when\r\nexposed in a capsule to the steam of boiling water, exhibits the same\r\nphenomenon, but that neither _Quina_ nor _Cinchonia_, by themselves, nor\r\ntheir acetates, possess this phosphorescent quality. This appears to be\r\nthe most efficient of all the salts of Bark, and is the one from which I\r\nhave frequently derived much advantage. In its exhibition we must be\r\ncareful not to combine it with substances that form insoluble compounds\r\nwith it. The _Infusum Rosæ compositum_ is objectionable as a vehicle, on\r\naccount of the astringent matter which it contains, and which therefore\r\nprecipitates the _Quina_ from its solution. I have lately seen a\r\nprescription, in which the salt is directed to be rubbed with a few\r\ngrains of _Cream of Tartar_, and then to be dissolved in mint water.\r\nThis is obviously injudicious, since Tartaric acid decomposes the\r\nsulphate, and occasions an insoluble _Tartrate_, which is precipitated.\r\nThe form in which I have usually prescribed it is in that of solution,\r\nwith a small quantity of sulphuric acid, in the proportion of a minim to\r\nevery grain of the salt. A _Wine of Quina_ may be made by adding five\r\ngrains of the sulphate to a pint of Sherry; a Tincture, by dissolving\r\nthe same quantity in eight fluid-ounces of Rectified Spirit. The\r\nsulphate is to be preferred to the pure _Quina_ in these cases, because,\r\nwhen the tincture is made by using the alkali, not saturated by an acid,\r\na precipitate is formed on adding it to aqueous liquors. Dose of the\r\nSulphate, gr. i.–v.\r\n\r\n_Acetate of Quina_, very remarkable for the great facility with which it\r\ncrystallizes, and for the pearly aspect and agreeable stellated grouping\r\nof the crystals; whereas the acetate of cinchonia crystallizes with\r\ndifficulty, and simply in plates transparent, and devoid of lustre.\r\n\r\n_Quina_ forms with the oxalic, gallic and tartaric acids, salts as\r\ninsoluble as those which the same acids form with _Cinchonia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      3. _Cinchona Oblongifolia._\r\n\r\nThe _Red Bark_ upon analysis was found to contain a double basis, and to\r\nyield both _Cinchonia_ and _Quina_, and, what is still more\r\nextraordinary, the quantity of each exceeded that which is known to\r\nexist in the _grey_ and yellow _barks_.\r\n\r\nThe latest experiments, however, made on very large quantities of the\r\nbark, have shewn that _Quina_ and _Cinchonia_ exist simultaneously in\r\nall the three species; but the _Cinchonia_ is, relatively to the\r\n_Quina_, in greater quantity in the _grey_ bark; whilst, in the _yellow_\r\nbark, the _Quina_ so predominates, that the presence of the _Cinchonia_\r\nmight well have escaped notice when small quantities were operated on.\r\n\r\nHaving thus furnished a sketch of this curious discovery, we have next\r\nto enquire whether the alkaline bases in question do actually\r\nconcentrate all the virtues of the barks in which they reside? M.\r\nMajendie[466] informs us that Pelletier had very early after the\r\ndiscovery transmitted to him a portion of the new substances for trial,\r\nand that he has unequivocally determined that they do not possess any\r\ndeleterious qualities,[467] and are therefore essentially different from\r\nthe principles of _Nux vomica_, (_Strychnine_,) Opium, (_Morphia_,) &c.\r\nAccording to the testimony of Dr. Double, as related in the same\r\njournal, they would seem to possess the medicinal properties of the\r\ncinchona.\r\n\r\nIn the third number of _Majendie’s Journal_ we receive a report from M.\r\nle docteur Renauldin, of an intermittent cured by the _Sulphate of\r\nCinchonia_, in doses of six grains.\r\n\r\nAs the discovery of an alkaline element in Opium led the way to the\r\ndetection of salifiable bases in other active vegetables,[468] it has\r\nseemed to me preferable that I should introduce those general\r\nobservations which I wish to offer upon the subject of those bodies,\r\nunder the history of that narcotic. It is only necessary in this place\r\nto caution the practitioner against the hasty generalizations of the too\r\nsanguine chemist; it has already been observed that those vegetable\r\nremedies, whose value has been established by the sober experience of\r\nages, consist of different principles of activity, or, at least, owe a\r\nmodified power to the compound effect of their several ingredients. (_p.\r\n154, note._)\r\n\r\nSOLUBILITY OF THE BARK.[469] Cold water extracts its bitter taste, with\r\nsome share of its odour; when assisted by a moderate heat, the infusion\r\nis stronger, but becomes turbid as it cools; the infusion cannot be\r\nkept, even for a short time, without undergoing decomposition, and being\r\nspoiled; wine also extracts the virtues of bark, and is prevented by\r\nthis substance from becoming sour, a fact which probably depends upon\r\nthe avidity with which some of the principles of bark combine with\r\noxygen, and which may throw some light upon the cause of its antiseptic\r\nvirtues. The colouring matter of wine is precipitated by bark, as it is\r\nby charcoal, in the course of a few days. By decoction the active matter\r\nof cinchona is in a great degree extracted, but if the process be\r\nprotracted beyond eight or ten minutes, it undergoes a very important\r\nchemical change, the precise nature of which is not well understood; the\r\nbalance of affinities, however, by which the different elements are\r\nunited, is evidently overthrown, and a considerable precipitation\r\nensues; oxygen would also appear to have been absorbed; whether the\r\n_Cinchonia_ becomes insoluble has not yet been ascertained, but\r\nexperience has shewn that the general loss of solubility, produced by\r\nsuch a process, is accompanied with a corresponding loss of medicinal\r\nactivity; on which account, the extract is necessarily a very\r\ninefficient preparation; if we attempt to redissolve it, not more than\r\none half is soluble in water. Vinegar is a less powerful solvent than\r\nwater; the active matter of bark is rendered more soluble by the\r\naddition of mineral acids, and by the earths and alkalies; these latter\r\nbodies deepen its colour, and precipitate the _Cinchonia_, for which\r\nreason, when they are employed, the decoction ought not to be filtered;\r\nsee _Form. 41, 42_, and note thereon. _Lime water_ has been recommended\r\nas a solvent, and it affords an excellent form for children and\r\ndyspeptic patients; for the same reason we obtain a stronger and perhaps\r\na more efficient preparation, by triturating it with magnesia, previous\r\nto the process of infusion. Alcohol is a very powerful solvent, but the\r\ngreat activity of this menstruum so limits its dose that we are\r\nprevented from exhibiting a sufficient quantity of the bark in the form\r\nof tincture; it furnishes however an excellent adjunct to other\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. Precipitates are produced by the _salts of\r\niron_, _sulphate of zinc_, _nitrate of silver_, _oxy-muriate of\r\nmercury_, _tartarized antimony_, _solutions of arsenic_, _&c._ Any\r\nconsiderable portion of a tincture produces also a precipitation, which\r\nsometimes does not immediately take place, and the medicinal value of\r\nthe bark is probably not impaired by it. As the infusions of _nut galls_\r\nand some other vegetable astringents precipitate the cinchonia from\r\nbark, it becomes a question how far such liquids are medicinally\r\ncompatible; saline additions, as _alum_, _muriate of ammonia_, _&c._\r\nhave been frequently proposed, but in many such mixtures decompositions\r\narise which must deceive us with regard to the expected effects. FORMS\r\nOF EXHIBITION. No form is so efficient as that of powder, a fact which\r\nwould seem to argue against the _exclusive_ value of the _Cinchonia_;\r\neven the ligneous fibre which the chemist pronounces to be inert and\r\nuseless, may produce its share of benefit by modifying the solubility of\r\nthe other ingredients, or by performing some mechanical duty which we\r\nare at present unable to understand or appreciate; but where the stomach\r\nrejects it, it must be administered in _infusion_ or _decoction_, with\r\nthe addition of its _tincture_. In cases where it is necessary to join\r\ncordials, an infusion of bark in Port wine[470] is a popular and very\r\nuseful form for its administration.

It is powerfully\r\ntonic and antiseptic; it was introduced into practice for curing\r\nintermittent fevers, but since that period it has been generally used in\r\ndiseases of debility, in fevers of the typhoid type, and in gangrene. It\r\nwas first conjectured to be useful in gout by Sydenham, and Dr. Haygarth\r\nhas strongly recommended its exhibition in acute rheumatism; when\r\nhowever it is used in these diseases, the greatest attention ought to be\r\npaid to the state of the bowels, and purgatives should be occasionally\r\ninterposed. In Dyspepsia, the use of the purer bitters is to be greatly\r\npreferred to that of the bark. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Infus.\r\nCinchonæ_, L.E.D. _Decoct.

The frauds committed under this head\r\nare most extensive; it is not only mixed with inferior barks, but\r\nfrequently with genuine bark, the active constituents of which have been\r\nentirely extracted by decoction with water. In selecting cinchona bark,\r\nthe following precautions may be useful; it should be dense, heavy and\r\ndry, not musty, nor spoiled by moisture; a decoction made of it should\r\nhave a reddish colour when warm; but when cold, it should become paler,\r\nand deposit a brownish red sediment. When the bark is of a dark _colour_\r\nbetween red and yellow, it is either of a bad species, or it has not\r\nbeen well preserved. Its _taste_ should be bitter, with a slight\r\nacidity, but not nauseous, nor very astringent; when chewed, it should\r\nnot appear in threads, nor of much length; the _odour_ is not very\r\nstrong, but when bark has been well cured, it is always perceptible, and\r\nthe stronger it is, provided it be pleasant, the better may the bark be\r\nconsidered. In order to give bark the form of _quill_, the bark\r\ngatherers not unfrequently call in the aid of artificial heat, by which\r\nits virtues are deteriorated; the fraud is detected by the colour being\r\nmuch darker, and upon splitting the bark, by the inside exhibiting\r\nstripes of a whitish sickly hue. In the form of powder, cinchona is\r\nalways found more or less adulterated. During a late official inspection\r\nof the shops of apothecaries and druggists, the Censors repeatedly met\r\nwith powdered cinchona having a harsh metallic taste, quite foreign to\r\nthat which characterizes good bark.[471] The best test of the goodness\r\nof bark is afforded by the quantity of _Cinchonia_, or _Quina_ that may\r\nbe extracted from it; and the manufacturer should always institute such\r\na trial before he purchases any quantity, taking a certain number of\r\npieces indiscriminately from the bulk. Much has been said of late\r\nconcerning the probability of the genuine species of the cinchona tree\r\nbecoming extinct; in consequence of which some succedaneum has been\r\nanxiously sought for; the bark of the broad-leaved willow, _Salix\r\nCaprea_, has been proposed for this purpose. Vogel recommends the root\r\nof _Geum urbanum avens_; others propose that of the _Dastisca canabina_.\r\n\r\nThe _Cinchona Caribæa_ of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia is said, by Dr.\r\nWright, to whom we are indebted for our knowledge of it, to have\r\nsatisfactorily answered in all cases where the Peruvian bark was\r\nindicated. The _Geoffræa Intermis_ is often sold for it.\r\n\r\nM. Ré, Professor of the Materia Medica at the Veterinary School at\r\nTurin, has announced that the _Lycopus Europæus_ of Linnæus, called by\r\nthe peasants of Piedmont the _Herb China_, is a complete succedaneum for\r\nPeruvian Bark.[472] The success with which bark has been imitated by\r\nmedicinal combination, has already been noticed in the first part of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\n\r\n              CINNAMOMI CORTEX. L.E.D (Laurus Cinnamomum.)\r\n\r\n                              _Cinnamon._\r\n\r\nThe qualities of Cinnamon depend upon the presence of an _essential\r\noil_. _Benzoic acid_ has been found in it. It is principally employed to\r\ncover the taste of nauseous medicines, and to correct the griping\r\nquality of different purgatives. It is, however, in itself, astringent\r\nand tonic, whence it has been found efficacious in the relief of alvine\r\nfluxes. ADULTERATIONS. It is sometimes intermixed with cinnamon from\r\nwhich the oil has been drawn; the fraud is detected by the weakness of\r\nthe odour and taste of the specimen; sometimes it is mixed with\r\n_cassia_, but this is soon discovered, for cassia is thick and clumsy,\r\nbreaks short, and smooth, and has a remarkable slimy taste, whereas the\r\nfracture of cinnamon is shivery, and its flavour warm and clean.\r\nCinnamon ought not to leave a mawkish taste in the mouth; this\r\ncircumstance denotes an inferior quality. There is an inferior kind\r\nimported into Europe from China, through the hands of private merchants;\r\nthis is distinguished by being darker coloured, rougher, denser, and by\r\nbreaking shorter; the taste is also harsher, more pungent, and ligneous,\r\nwithout the sweetness of Ceylon cinnamon.

USES. Its medicinal virtues are now\r\nentirely discredited, and it is only employed for the sake of its\r\ncolouring matter, for the purpose of a dye; it was known to the\r\nPhœnicians, and was the _tolu_ of the Jews. Its watery solution is of a\r\nviolet crimson, its alcoholic of a deep crimson, and its alkaline of a\r\npurple hue; the colour of the watery infusion is brightened by acids,\r\ncream of tartar, and alum, and at the same time partly precipitated. Dr.\r\nJohn has given the name of _Cochenelin_ to this colouring principle,\r\nwhich M. M. Pelletier and Caventou have lately obtained in a perfectly\r\npure state, as a very brilliant purple red powder with a granular\r\ncrystalline appearance; these chemists propose to call it _Carmine_, but\r\nas Mr. Children very justly observes, if we adopt the term, its\r\ntermination should be altered, to avoid confounding the pure colouring\r\nmatter with the pigment in common use. It may be called _Carmina_, a\r\nmore harmonious name than Cochenelin, (Ann: de Chimie, vol. viii).\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. The colouring matter is decomposed by _sulphate\r\nof iron_, _sulphate of zinc_, and _acetate of lead_.

When recent it has scarcely any _odour_, but its _taste_ is\r\nbitter, hot and acrid. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Its properties reside in a\r\nmilky juice, and depend upon an alkaline principle; it contains also\r\ngum, starch, inulin, and extractive matter, which, when in solution,\r\nundergoes a chemical change, analogous, I apprehend, to that which takes\r\nplace in the infusion of Senna, and it would appear with similar\r\ninconvenience. Sir Everard Home ascertained that this deposit, in the\r\nvinous infusion, excites nausea and griping, but that it may be removed\r\nwithout destroying the efficacy of the medicine. The alkaline element,\r\nsimilar to that of the Hellebore (_Veratria_), lately found in it,\r\nappears to exist in combination with gallic acid. (_Annales de Chimie_,\r\n_tom._ xiv. _Mai_, 1820.) This alkaline body would seem to display its\r\ngreatest energies by its action upon mucous surfaces; in small portions\r\nit excites violent sneezing, and when applied to the membrane of the\r\nstomach, immediate vomiting and purging are the result.[474] See\r\n_Veratri radix_. The virtues of the bulb of Colchicum are very variable,\r\naccording to the place of growth and season of the year. Since the third\r\nedition of this work, I have been favoured with some valuable\r\nobservations upon this subject by Mr. Alexander Gordon; he says that it\r\nis in its greatest perfection from the beginning of June until the\r\nmiddle of August.[475] It is also necessary to extract the virtues of\r\nthe bulb as soon as it is gathered, for although removed from the earth,\r\nthe developing process of vegetation continues, and the substance\r\nundergoes a corresponding series of chemical changes, and finally\r\nbecomes as inert as if it had remained in the ground. It is a problem of\r\nsome importance to discover a method of destroying the vegetable life of\r\nthe bulb, without at the same time injuring its virtues, for I apprehend\r\nthat a want of attention to the above precaution frequently renders the\r\nvinous infusion inactive. The practitioner engaged in preparing this\r\nvegetable remedy will find some valuable directions in the third edition\r\nof Thomson’s Dispensatory. The flower of the _meadow saffron_ is very\r\npoisonous to cattle. SOLUBILITY. Vinegar and wine[476] are the best\r\nmenstrua for extracting its active qualities; by decoction its essential\r\noil is dissipated. MEDICINAL USES. It has been much extolled on the\r\ncontinent as a remedy in dropsy, especially in hydro-thorax, and in\r\nhumoral asthma; its operation however as a diuretic, is less certain\r\nthan squill, although its _modus operandi_ is analogous to it, as will\r\nbe seen by referring to our new arrangement of Diuretic remedies. As a\r\n_specific_ in gout its efficacy has been fully ascertained; it allays\r\npain, and cuts short the paroxysm. It has also a decided action upon the\r\narterial system, which it would appear to control through the medium of\r\nthe nerves. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. In my opinion, acids, and all\r\noxygenated substances render the vinous infusion drastic; on the\r\ncontrary, alkalies render its principles more soluble, and its operation\r\nmore mild, but not less efficacious. Magnesia may judiciously accompany\r\nits exhibition.

Dr. Williams of Ipswich has lately published an account\r\nof the efficacy of the _Seeds_ of Colchicum, which he says possess all\r\nthe virtues of the root, without its pernicious[477] qualities; the form\r\nin which he administers them, is in that of vinous infusion.[478] He\r\nalso informs me that he has experienced considerable tonic effects from\r\nthese seeds; and that unlike other narcotic remedies they do not appear\r\nto produce, or favour congestion in the head. The seeds ought not to be\r\nbruised, as their virtues reside chiefly in the husk, or cortical part.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      COLOCYNTHIDIS PULPA.

Alcohol and water alike\r\nextract its virtues, but the active principle resides both in the\r\nportion soluble in water, and in that which is insoluble. MEDICINAL\r\nUSES. It is a very powerful drastic cathartic, and was employed by the\r\nancients in dropsical and lethargic diseases. Many attempts have been\r\nmade to mitigate its violence, which is best effected by triturating it\r\nwith gummy farinaceous substances, or the oily seeds; the watery\r\ndecoction or infusion is much less severe, and has been recommended in\r\nworm cases, but it is rarely employed, except in combination with other\r\npurgatives. Thunberg informs us, (_see his Travels_, _vol._ ii, _p._\r\n171) that this article is rendered so perfectly mild at the Cape of Good\r\nHope by being pickled, that it is absolutely used as food both by the\r\nnatives and colonists.

Saccharine matter enters\r\ninto each of these compositions, but in different proportions, and for\r\ndifferent objects. In conserves it is intended to preserve the virtues\r\nof recent vegetables; in electuaries, to impart convenience of form. See\r\n_Electuaria_.\r\n\r\nCONFECTIO AMYGDALARUM. L.

L. _Electuarium Aromaticum_. E.D. This is a very\r\nuseful combination of various aromatics, to which the London and Dublin\r\ncolleges have added a _carbonate of lime_; this circumstance makes the\r\npreparation a judicious constituent for the exhibition of active salts,\r\nliable to be invalidated by the presence of acid in the stomach, but, at\r\nthe same time, rendering it incompatible with _acids_, _antimonial\r\nwine_, &c. These observations do not of course extend to the _aromatic\r\nelectuary_ of the Edinburgh pharmacopœia. See _Form: 15, 42, 49, 125,\r\n126_. DOSE, ℈j to ʒj.\r\n\r\nCONFECTIO CASSIÆ. L.

The pharmaceutist, in\r\npreparing it, must take care that he does not substitute the syrup of\r\nthe _red_, for that of the _damask_ rose; a substitution, as stated\r\nunder the head of Syrupi, not very unusual.

One grain of opium is contained in grs. 36 of the London, and\r\nin grs. 43 of the Edinburgh preparation. DOSE, grs. x to xxx.\r\n\r\nCONFECTIO PIPERIS NIGRI. L. This preparation has been introduced into\r\nthe Pharmacopœia, on the suggestion of several eminent practitioners,\r\nwho have experienced its utility in certain cases of Piles. It is\r\nintended to resemble WARD’S[479] PASTE, whose composition has been given\r\nin all the former editions of this work, and according to which Formula\r\nthe committee have directed the present preparation. It is principally\r\nuseful in those cases attended with considerable debility, in\r\nleucophlegmatic habits, and when piles arise from a deficient secretion\r\nin the rectum. On the other hand, the composition will as certainly\r\nprove injurious in those cases which are accompanied with erysipelatous\r\ninflammation, and which require cooling laxatives, and a total\r\nabstinence from all stimulants, for their cure.\r\n\r\nCONFECTIO ROSÆ CANINÆ, olim _Conserva Cynosbati_. Its acidity depends\r\nupon uncombined citric acid, a circumstance which it is essential to\r\nremember when we direct its use in combination.

It is sometimes brightened by\r\nthe addition of a small proportion of sulphuric acid; this is a\r\ncircumstance of great importance, where the confection is used for\r\nmaking the mercurial pill.

The ingredients of\r\nthis preparation are senna leaves, figs, tamarind pulp, cassia pulp, the\r\npulp of prunes, coriander seeds, liquorice root, and refined sugar. It\r\nis gently laxative, and is an excellent vehicle for the exhibition of\r\nmore powerful cathartics. (_Form. 74, 93._) When properly made, it is an\r\nelegant preparation, not apt to ferment, nor to become acescent; the\r\ndirections of the pharmacopœia are however rarely followed. Jalap\r\nblackened with walnut liquor, is frequently substituted for the more\r\nexpensive article cassia; and the great bulk of it, sold in London, is\r\nlittle else than prunes, figs, and jalap. I understand that a\r\nconsiderable quantity is also manufactured in Staffordshire, into which\r\nunsound and spoilt apples enter as a principal ingredient. The\r\npreparation sold at Apothecaries’ Hall is certainly unique in\r\nexcellence. Dose, ʒij or more.\r\n\r\nThe above are the principal confections which are employed in modern\r\npractice, for happily the shops are at length disencumbered of those\r\nnauseous insignificant conserves, unknown to the ancients, but which\r\nwere ushered into use by the Arabian physicians, and which continued for\r\nso many years to disgrace our dispensatories and to embarrass our\r\npractice. The French, in their new Codex Medicamentarius, have limited\r\ntheir electuaries to a number not exceeding nine; they have however made\r\nup in complexity for deficiency in number; the _Electuarium de croco_,\r\nwhich is intended to answer the same ends as our confectio aromatica,\r\nhas no less than twelve ingredients, although the force of the\r\ncombination depends entirely upon carbonate of lime, cinnamon, and\r\nsaffron; and so it is with the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 CONII FOLIA.

The leaves, when properly dried, have a strong and narcotic\r\nodour, and a slightly bitter and nauseous taste: the fresh leaves\r\ncontain not only the narcotic, but also the acrid principle: by\r\nexsiccation, the latter is nearly lost, but the former undergoes no\r\nchange; the medicinal properties of the leaves are therefore improved by\r\nthe operation of drying. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The medicinal activity of\r\nthe plant resides in a resinous element, which may be obtained in an\r\ninsulated form, by evaporating an ethereal tincture made with the\r\nleaves, on the surface of water; it has a rich dark green colour, and\r\ncontains the peculiar odour and taste of hemlock in perfection; a dose\r\nof half a grain will produce vertigo and head-ache. It may be\r\ndistinguished by the name of _Conein_. The watery extract of this plant\r\ncan therefore possess but little power, a fact which Orfila has fully\r\nestablished by experiment. No part of the plant is entirely destitute of\r\nefficacy, though the leaves possess the most activity. SOLUBILITY.\r\nAlcohol and æther extract its virtues. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. Its\r\nenergies are greatly diminished by vegetable acids; hence vinegar is its\r\nbest antidote. MEDICINAL USES. It is a powerful sedative, and has been\r\ndeservedly commended for its powers in allaying morbid irritability:\r\naccording to my own experience, it is, in well directed doses, by far\r\nthe most efficacious of all palliatives, for quieting pulmonary\r\nirritation. It has been extolled also in the cure of schirrus and\r\ncancer, and it will without doubt prove in such cases a valuable\r\nresource, from its sedative influence. Externally, it will afford\r\nconsiderable relief in irritable ulcers, when applied in the form of\r\nfomentation or cataplasm, see _Form. 17, 18_. FORMS OF EXHIBITION.

It is insoluble in\r\nwater, but soluble in ten parts of alcohol, and in expressed and\r\nessential oils; with the pure alkalies it forms white saponaceous\r\ncompounds which are soluble in water, forming opaque emulsions.\r\nMEDICINAL USES. Stimulant, diuretic, and laxative; it seems to act more\r\npowerfully on the urinary passages than any of the other resinous\r\nfluids; hence its use in gleets and in fluor albus. Its use gives the\r\nurine an intensely bitter taste, but not a violet smell, as the\r\nturpentines do. By referring to the Synoptical arrangement of Diuretic\r\nremedies, it will appear that _Copaiba_ is referred to Class I, 1. _b._\r\nfor there is reason to believe that its active principle undergoes\r\nabsorption, and by coming in contact with the urinary organs, produces\r\nthe medicinal effects for which it is so highly valued. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. Diffused in soft or distilled water by yolk of egg, or by\r\ntwice its weight of mucilage, fʒss to every f℥j of water, forms an\r\nelegant mixture, or it may be given dropped on sugar, and in this latter\r\nform it is certainly more disposed to act on the urinary organs, than\r\nwhen exhibited in that of an emulsion. (_Form. 156._) Dr. Chapman has\r\nproposed a new mode of exhibiting this medicine; he advises us to pour\r\nthe Copaiba on half a wine-glassful of water, and afterwards to add\r\nslowly a few drops of a common bitter tincture, by which means the\r\nCopaiba will be collected in a small globule that may be easily\r\nswallowed, while its taste, so nauseous to most patients, will be\r\nentirely masked by the bitterness of the vehicle. In whatever form,\r\nhowever, this medicine is administered, it is extremely apt to derange\r\nthe digestive organs, if long continued, and the unpleasant effects thus\r\noccasioned remain, in some cases, for a very long period.[480]\r\nADULTERATIONS. A considerable quantity sold in London is entirely\r\n_factitious_. A curious trial took place some time since, between the\r\nowner of certain premises that were burnt down, and the Governors of the\r\nSun Fire Office, in consequence of the latter refusing to indemnify the\r\nproprietor for his loss, because the fire had been occasioned by his\r\n_making_ Balsam of Copaiba. This article is also adulterated with\r\nmastiche and oil; M. Bucholz asserts that if it does not dissolve in a\r\nmixture of four parts of pure alcohol, and one of rectified æther, we\r\nmay infer its adulteration; _rape oil_ is also frequently mixed with it,\r\nin which case if dropped into water, the drops will not retain their\r\nspherical form, as they invariably will, if pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     CORNUA.

One hundred parts consist of sixty-two of\r\nextractive, the remaining parts are chiefly ligneous fibre, with small\r\nportions of resin and essential oil. Bouillon Lagrange and Vogel have\r\nexamined this extractive matter very accurately, and from the\r\ncircumstance of its watery infusion assuming different colours when\r\ntreated with different agents, they have named it _polychroite_. Thus\r\nchlorine and light destroy its colour, sulphuric acid changes it to\r\nindigo, which gradually becomes lilac, and nitric acid gives it a green\r\nhue. SOLUBILITY. It yields its colour and active ingredients to water,\r\nalcohol, proof spirit, wine, vinegar, and in a less degree to æther; the\r\nwatery infusion, and the vinous tincture soon grow sour, and lose their\r\nproperties, and the solution in vinegar becomes quickly colourless.

It is not unfrequently sophisticated with the fibres of\r\nsmoked beef, or the petals of flowers, especially of the marigold,\r\n(_Calendula Officinalis_,) and of the safflower, (_Carthamus\r\nTinctorius_.) The former of these fraudulent ingredients is indicated by\r\nthe unpleasant odour which arises when the saffron is thrown upon live\r\ncoals; the latter, by infusing the specimen in hot water, when the\r\nexpanded stigmata may be easily distinguished from the other petals of\r\nsubstituted flowers; a deficiency of colour and odour in the infusion\r\nindicates that a tincture or infusion has already been drawn from the\r\nsaffron, and that it has been subsequently pressed again into a cake. In\r\nthe market is to be found saffron from Sicily, France, and Spain,\r\nbesides the English; that which is imported from Spain, is generally\r\nspoiled with oil, in which it is dipt with the intention of preserving\r\nit.

(Piper Cubeba.) _Baccæ._\r\n\r\n                      _Cubebs_, or _Java Pepper_.\r\n\r\nThis Indian spice, a native of Java, formerly held a place in our\r\nmateria medica, and entered into the composition of _mithridate_ and\r\n_theriaca_, but being inferior in pungency and aromatic warmth to\r\npepper, it fell into disuse. Lately, however, it has been ushered into\r\nsurgical practice for the cure of gonorrhœa, with all the extravagance\r\nof praise which usually attends the revival of an old, or the\r\nintroduction of a new medicine.[482] It has been pronounced to be a\r\nspecific in this complaint, if taken in the early stages, in the dose of\r\na dessert-spoonful three times a day, in a sufficient quantity of\r\nwater.[483] The Indians have been long acquainted with the influence\r\nwhich cubebs exerts upon these organs; thus Garcias, “_Apud Indos\r\ncubebarum in vino maceratarum est usus ad exitandam venerem_.” CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. M. Vauquelin has lately made a very accurate analysis of\r\nthis pepper, from which its composition may be stated as follows: 1. A\r\nvolatile oil, which is nearly solid.—2. A resin, _resembling Balsam of\r\nCopaiba_.—3. Another and coloured resin.—4. A coloured gummy matter.—5.\r\nAn extractive principle, similar to that which is found in leguminous\r\nplants.—6. Some saline substances. He considers the resin _resembling\r\nthe Copaiba_, to be the peculiar matter in which that property resides,\r\nwhich imparts to it the power of curing gonorrhœa. As the qualities of\r\nthis spice do not reside in volatile elements, an extract made with\r\nrectified spirit will be found to possess the whole of its virtues. The\r\nFrench, in their new _Codex Medicamentarius_, have introduced the cubebs\r\ninto their list of materia medica. There is a precaution, with respect\r\nto the exhibition of Cubebs, which it is important for the practitioner\r\nto remember—to keep the bowels thoroughly open; for where hardened fæces\r\nare allowed to accumulate, the spice insinuates itself into the mass,\r\nand produces excoriations in the rectum. ADULTERATIONS. The “Turkey\r\nYellow Berries,” i. e. the dried fruit of the _Rhamnus Catharticus_, are\r\noften substituted for the Cubebs, and the similarity between them is so\r\ngreat, that the casual observer may be easily deceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  CUMINI[484] SEMINA. L. Cumin Seeds.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, strong, heavy, and peculiar; _Taste_, bitterish and\r\nwarm. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gum, resin, and a yellow pungent oil, upon\r\nwhich the peculiar properties of the seeds depend. SOLUBILITY. Water\r\ndoes not extract more than their odour, but alcohol dissolves all the\r\nprinciples in which their virtues reside, and leaves upon evaporation a\r\npowerful extract. MEDICINAL USES. Carminative and stomachic; they are\r\nhowever but rarely used, except as an ingredient in plasters.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CUPRI SULPHAS. L.E.D. Sulphate of Copper.\r\n\r\n                 vulgo _Blue Vitriol_. _Blue Copperas._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, crystals, which are rhomboidal prisms. _Colour_, a\r\ndeep rich blue. _Taste_, harsh, acrid, and styptic; they slightly\r\neffloresce; when treated with sulphuric acid, no effervescence occurs, a\r\ncircumstance which at once distinguishes this salt from _Œrugo_.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. According to the latest experiments, it is an\r\n_oxy-sulphate_, consisting of one proportional of peroxide with two\r\nproportionals of sulphuric acid, and when crystallized, it contains ten\r\nproportionals of water; its beautiful colour depends on this last\r\ningredient. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in four parts of water at 60, and\r\nin less than two at 212°; the solution shews an excess of acid by\r\nreddening litmus. In alcohol it is insoluble. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.\r\n_Alkalies and their carbonates_; _sub-borate of soda_; _acetate of\r\nammonia_; _tartrate of potass_; _muriate of lime_; _nitrate of silver_;\r\n_sub-acetate, and acetate of lead_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_; _all\r\nastringent vegetable infusions and tinctures_. Iron immersed in the\r\nsolution, precipitates copper in a metallic form; hence the exhibition\r\nof the filings of iron has been proposed as an antidote.[485] MEDICINAL\r\nUSES. It is emetic from grs. ij to xv. tonic gr. 1/4; it is, however,\r\nbut rarely used internally except as an emetic; externally it is\r\nemployed as an escharotic; and, in solution, as a stimulant to foul\r\nobstinate ulcers.[487] In the proportion of half a drachm to eight\r\nounces of rose water, it forms a lotion which has been found very\r\nefficacious in phagedenic ulcers of the face, and in allaying itching\r\nwhen attended with erysipelatous inflammation about the anus and labia\r\npudendi. It is also a styptic when applied in solution. OFFICINAL\r\nPREPARATION. _Solut.

There is found in the market a particular bark, which has\r\nbeen called FINE ANGUSTURA, but which is of a different species, and is\r\na very energetic poison. This bark is characterized by having its\r\nepidermis covered with a matter which has the appearance of rust of\r\niron, and which, moreover, possesses certain chemical properties of this\r\nmetal; for if water acidulated with muriatic acid be agitated in contact\r\nwith its powder, it assumes a beautiful green colour, and affords with\r\nan alkaline prussiate, (_Hydro-cyanate of Potass_) a Prussian blue\r\nprecipitate. Late researches have detected the presence of an alkaline\r\nelement in this bark, on which the name of _Brucia_ has been bestowed.\r\nWhen this alkali is dissolved in boiling alcohol, and crystallized by\r\nspontaneous evaporation, it yields colourless and transparent crystals\r\nin the form of oblique quadrangular prisms.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DATURÆ STRAMONII HERBA. E.D.\r\n\r\n               _The Herbaceous part of the Thorn Apple._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, fœtid and narcotic, occasioning head-ache and\r\nstupor; _Taste_, bitter and somewhat nauseous. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nGum, resin, and carbonate of ammonia; the recent experiments of M.\r\nBrandes have also developed an alkaline element of activity, to which\r\nthe name of _Daturia_ has been assigned; it appears to exist in native\r\ncombination with malic acid; when in an uncombined state it is nearly\r\ninsoluble in water, and in cold alcohol, but boiling alcohol dissolves\r\nit. It has been obtained with difficulty in the form of quadrangular\r\nprisms. SOLUBILITY. The medicinal powers of the herb are alike extracted\r\nby aqueous and spirituous menstrua. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. The\r\ninfusion is precipitated by the salts of lead, silver, mercury, and\r\niron; the mineral acids would also appear to produce some essential\r\nchanges which may diminish its efficacy. Acetic acid increases its\r\npowers, although it relieves the effects of an overdose, if administered\r\nafter the stomach has been emptied. This apparent anomaly is easily\r\nexplained when we consider, that in the first case its operation is\r\npurely _chemical_, increasing the solubility of the active principle of\r\nthe plant, while in the latter case it operates as a _vital_ agent,\r\nrestoring to the nervous system that energy which has been suspended by\r\nthe narcotic influence of the vegetable. MEDICINAL USES. It is narcotic,\r\nand has been regarded by many authors as eminently antispasmodic; Dr.\r\nBarton, an American physician, made very extensive trials of its\r\nefficacy in Mania, the result of which is highly favourable to its use.\r\nDr. Marcet first noticed its salutary effects in chronic diseases\r\nattended with violent pain; he found it to lessen powerfully, and\r\nquickly, sensibility and pain, and to produce a sort of nervous shock,\r\nattended with a momentary affection of the head and eyes, with a degree\r\nof nausea, and with phenomena resembling those which are produced by\r\nintoxication. It seems to be more particularly beneficial in chronic\r\nrheumatism, sciatica, &c. Its root, smoked in the manner of tobacco, has\r\nbeen much extolled as a remedy in the paroxysms of spasmodic asthma;\r\nthis practice however, is not unattended with danger;[488] the same\r\ntransient feelings of relief may be procured by smoking a mixture of\r\nopium and any aromatic herb. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. Some discrepancy of\r\nopinion has existed upon this point; the native practitioners in the\r\nCarnatic gave the powdered root; Hufeland recommends a tincture of the\r\nwhole plant; in this country an extract of the leaves, or, more lately,\r\nof the seeds, has been preferred, and I have been recently informed by\r\nSir Henry Halford, that he has found a tincture made with the\r\nseeds,[489] a very efficient and unobjectionable preparation. Dr. Davy,\r\nat my request, has made a series of experiments upon the extracts\r\nprepared by Mr. Barry _in vacuo_, and his report upon the effects of\r\nthat of Stramonium, will be found under the article _Extract.\r\nStramonii_, which see. DOSE. In the commencement, of the leaves powdered\r\ngr. i. of the seeds gr. ss. It is said that the Turks sometimes use the\r\nStramonium instead of Opium, and the Chinese infuse the seeds in beer.\r\nCataplasms of the fresh bruised leaves have been very successfully used\r\nin sores of a highly irritable and painful nature. OFFICINAL\r\nPREPARATION. _Extract. Stramonii._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     DECOCTA. L.E.D. _Decoctions._\r\n\r\nThese are solutions of the active principles of vegetables obtained by\r\nboiling them in water. To decide upon the expediency of this form of\r\npreparation, in each particular case, requires a knowledge of the\r\nchemical composition of the substance in question. In conducting the\r\noperation, the following rules must be observed.\r\n\r\n  1. _Those substances only should be decocted, whose medicinal powers\r\n  reside in principles which are soluble in water._\r\n\r\n  2. _If the active principle be volatile, decoction must be an\r\n  injurious process; and, if it consist of extractive matter, long\r\n  boiling, by favouring its oxidizement, will render it insipid,\r\n  insoluble, and inert._\r\n\r\n  3. _The substances to be decocted should be previously bruised, or\r\n  sliced, so as to expose an extended surface to the action of the\r\n  water._\r\n\r\n  4. _The substances should be completely covered with water, and the\r\n  vessel slightly closed, in order to prevent, as much as possible,\r\n  the access of air: the boiling should be continued without\r\n  interruption, and gently._\r\n\r\n  5. _In compound decoctions, it is sometimes convenient not to put in\r\n  all the ingredients from the beginning, but in succession, according\r\n  to their hardness, and the difficulty with which their virtues are\r\n  extracted; and if any aromatic, or other substances containing\r\n  volatile principles, or oxidizable matter, enter into the\r\n  composition, the boiling decoction should be simply poured upon\r\n  them, and covered up until cold._\r\n\r\n  6. _The relative proportions of different vegetable substances to\r\n  the water, must be regulated by their nature; the following general\r\n  rule may be admitted; of roots, barks, or dried woods, from ʒij to\r\n  ʒvj to every pint of water; of herbs, leaves, or flowers, half that\r\n  quantity will suffice._\r\n\r\n  7. _The decoction ought to be filtered through linen, while hot, as\r\n  important portions of the dissolved matter are frequently deposited\r\n  on cooling; care must be also taken that the filtre is not too fine,\r\n  for it frequently happens, that the virtues of a decoction depend\r\n  upon the presence of particles which are suspended in a minutely\r\n  divided state._\r\n\r\n  8. _A decoction should be prepared in small quantities only, and\r\n  never employed, especially in summer, forty-eight hours after it has\r\n  been made. It should be considered as an extemporaneous preparation,\r\n  but introduced into the pharmacopœia for the purpose of convenience,\r\n  and for the sake of abridging the labour of the physician._\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the water employed for making decoctions,\r\nshould be free from that quality which is denominated _hardness_.\r\n\r\nThe officinal decoctions may be classed into simple and compound\r\npreparations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              1. _Simple._\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM CINCHONÆ. See Cinchona, and _Form: 41, 42, 127_. The codex of\r\nParis directs a decoction of bark, “_Decoctum Kinœ Kinœ_,” which is only\r\nhalf the strength of ours, but contains an addition of a small quantity\r\nof carbonate of potass.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM CYDONIÆ. The inner coats of the seeds of the Quince (_Pyrus\r\nCydonia_) yield a very large proportion of mucilage, but as hot water\r\nextracts from them also fecula and other principles, the decoction very\r\nsoon decomposes. It has been strongly recommended as an application to\r\nerysipelatous surfaces; and it would seem to be peculiarly adapted for\r\nsuch a purpose, since it is not so easily washed away from the part to\r\nwhich it is applied, as ordinary mucilage; for the same reason it has\r\nbeen preferred as an ingredient in injections, gargles, &c. It is stated\r\nby some practitioners to be a very useful application, when united with\r\nthe _acetate of lead_, in cases of acute ophthalmia; such a combination,\r\nhowever, is extremely unchemical, and must invalidate the powers of the\r\nother ingredients. The native practitioners of India employ it as a\r\ncooling mucilaginous drink in gonorrhœa. An ounce of bruised Quince seed\r\nwill make three pints of water as thick and ropy as the white of an egg;\r\nhence two drachms, the quantity directed by the College, is amply\r\nsufficient for a pint of the decoction. It is coagulated by _alcohol_,\r\n_acids_, and _metallic salts_.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM DIGITALIS. D. This is a very improper form for the exhibition\r\nof digitalis, being variable in strength.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM DULCAMARÆ. L. In making this decoction we must take care that\r\nthe operation of boiling is not continued too long. See _Dulcamaræ\r\nCaules_. DOSE from f℥ss to f℥j.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM LICHENIS. L.E.D. In this preparation we have the bitter\r\nprinciple of the plant united with its fecula. A portion of the former\r\nmay be removed by macerating the lichen, and rejecting the first water.\r\nIf ℥j of the mass be boiled for a quarter of an hour in f℥vj of water,\r\nwe shall obtain mucilage of a consistence similar to that composed of\r\none part of gum arabic and three of water. Its exhibition requires the\r\nsame precaution as that of _Mucilago Acaciæ_. From the large proportion\r\nof fecula which this moss contains, it is perhaps as nutritive as any\r\nvegetable substance, the _Cerealia_ of course excepted. See _Lichen\r\nIsland_. DOSE, a wine glass full occasionally.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM PAPAVERIS. L. In making this decoction the whole of the capsule\r\nshould be bruised, in order to obtain its mucilage and anodyne\r\nprinciple; the seeds should be also retained, as they yield a portion of\r\nbland oil which increases the emollient quality of the decoction. A\r\nlarge quantity of fixed oil is constantly in the market, which is\r\nderived from the seeds of the poppy. This decoction is a useful\r\nfomentation in painful swellings, &c.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM QUERCUS. L.E. Decoction is the usual form in which _Oak Bark_\r\nis exhibited, since all its active principles are soluble in water. Its\r\nastringent virtues depend upon gallic acid, tannin, and extractive. The\r\ndecoction is disturbed by the following substances; the _infusion of\r\nyellow cinchona_; _sub-acetate_ and _acetate of lead_; _solutions of\r\nisinglass_; the _preparations of iron_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_; and\r\n_sulphate of zinc_; all _alkaline substances_ destroy its astringency,\r\nand are consequently incompatible with it. It is principally useful as a\r\nlocal astringent, in the forms of gargle, injection, or lotion. Its\r\ninternal exhibition in obstinate diarrhœas, and alvine hemorrhages, has\r\nalso proved highly beneficial. See _Form: 51, 61_. DOSE, f℥ss to f℥j.\r\nDr. Eberle states that in the Intermittents of very young children, he\r\nhas in some cases used this decoction as a bath with efficacy.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM SARSAPARILLÆ. L.E.D. See Sarsaparilla. In making this\r\ndecoction, it is rarely properly digested or boiled for a sufficient\r\nlength of time to extract its virtues. The only salts which occasion\r\nprecipitates in this decoction are, _nitrate of mercury_ and _acetate of\r\nlead_; _lime water_ has the same effect. DOSE, f℥iv to f℥vj.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM VERATRI. Stimulant and acrid; internally, it is cathartic, but\r\ntoo violent to be safely exhibited; it is useful as a lotion in scabies,\r\nand other cutaneous eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       2. _Compound Decoctions._\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM ALOES COMPOSITUM. It resembles the well known _Beaume de vie_,\r\nalthough less purgative, and is a scientific preparation, constructed\r\nupon the true principles of medicinal combination. Aloes is the base, to\r\nwhich are added, 1st, sub-carbonate of potass, 2ndly, powdered myrrh,\r\n3dly, extract of liquorice, 4thly, saffron, and after the decoction is\r\nmade, 5thly, compound tincture of cardamoms. By the 1st ingredient the\r\naloes is rendered more soluble; the 2d and 3d suspend the portion not\r\ndissolved, and at the same time disguise its bitterness; the 4th imparts\r\nan aromatic flavour, and the 5th not only renders it more grateful to\r\nthe stomach, but prevents any spontaneous decomposition from taking\r\nplace. Its taste is improved by keeping. It is a warm, gentle cathartic.\r\n_Form: 80._ DOSE, f℥ss to f℥j. Its operation is different from that of\r\nsimple aloes. See _Aloes_. The following substances are incompatible\r\nwith it; _strong acids_, _oxy-muriate of mercury_; _tartarized\r\nantimony_; _sulphate of zinc_; and _acetate of lead_; and those salts\r\nwhich are decomposed by sub-carbonate of potass.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM GUAIACI COMPOSITUM. E. Commonly called _Decoction of woods._\r\nThis decoction has fallen into disuse, and deservedly, for it can\r\npossess but little power, except, as a diluent, or demulcent; the water\r\ntakes up from the guaiacum only a small portion of extractive matter,\r\nand the virtues of sassafras, if any, must be dissipated. DOSE, f℥ss to\r\nf℥j.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM HORDEI COMPOSITUM.[490] An elegant and useful demulcent, with\r\nan aperient tendency.\r\n\r\nDECOCTUM SARSAPARILLÆ COMPOSITUM. L.D. This decoction, which is an\r\nimitation of the once celebrated _Lisbon Diet Drink_,[491] differs\r\nmaterially from the _Decoct: Guaiaci comp:_ from the addition of the\r\nmezereon root, which renders it diaphoretic and alterative, and useful\r\nin the treatment of secondary syphilis, and chronic rheumatism. DOSE,\r\nfrom f℥iv to f℥vj three or four times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n            DIGITALIS FOLIA. L.E.D. (_Digitalis Purpurea._)\r\n\r\n                              _Foxglove._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. The leaves, when properly dried, have a slight narcotic\r\n_odour_, and a bitter nauseous _taste_, and when reduced to powder, a\r\nbeautiful green _colour_. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Extractive matter, and a\r\ngreen resin, in both of which the narcotic properties reside; they\r\nappear also to contain ammonia, and some other salts.[492] SOLUBILITY.\r\nBoth water and alcohol extract their virtues, but decoction injures\r\nthem. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. See _Infusum Digitalis_. MEDICINAL USES.\r\nIt is directly sedative, although some maintain the contrary opinion,\r\ndiminishing the frequency of the pulse, and the general irritability of\r\nthe system, and increasing the action of the absorbents, and the\r\ndischarge by urine. The effects appear to be in a great degree connected\r\nwith its sensible influence upon the body, which is indicated by\r\nfeelings of slight nausea and languor; accordingly, every attempt to\r\nprevent these unpleasant effects, or to _correct_ the operation of\r\ndigitalis, by combining it with aromatic, or stimulant medicines, seems\r\nto be fatal to the diuretic powers of the remedy. Dr. Blackall, in his\r\n“Observations upon the cure of Dropsies,” has offered some remarks which\r\nbear upon this point, and to which I have before referred. _See page 96\r\n& 150._\r\n\r\nSeveral of the formulæ introduced under the class of diuretics are\r\ncombinations supported by high authority, but it is doubtful whether\r\ntheir adoption can be sanctioned upon principle; they are however well\r\ncalculated to illustrate the nature of diuretic compounds, and this is\r\nthe only purpose for which they were selected. See _Form: 103_. The\r\nFrench have introduced in their new Codex, an ethereal tincture,\r\n_Tinctura Ætherea_ _Digitalis purpureæ_, in which the sedative influence\r\nof the plant must be entirely overwhelmed by the stimulant properties of\r\nthe menstruum. Under the head of _Diuretics_, I have so fully considered\r\nthe value of diuretic combinations, and the _modus operandi_ of\r\nDigitalis, that it is unnecessary to dwell upon the subject in this\r\nplace. Digitalis has considerable influence over the action of the\r\nheart; and in certain diseases, attended with inordinate motions of that\r\norgan, it proves eminently serviceable; I have employed it with great\r\nsatisfaction in cases of palpitation connected with a state of general\r\nirritability, so frequently occurring in female disorders; and according\r\nto my observations where it succeeds, opium generally does harm. _Form:\r\n32._ FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In substance, tincture, or infusion; the\r\nlatter form is most efficient as a diuretic. DOSE of the powdered leaves\r\ngr. j, in a pill, twice a day; the augmentation of the dose should\r\nproceed at the rate of one-fourth of the original quantity, every second\r\nday, until its operation becomes apparent, either on the kidneys, or on\r\nthe constitution generally. If it produce such a disturbance in the\r\nprimæ viæ as to occasion vomiting or purging, its diuretic powers will\r\nbe lost; in such a case the addition of a small portion of opium, or\r\nopiate confection, may be expedient. The distressing effects of an\r\noverdose are best counteracted by tincture of opium in brandy and water,\r\nand by the application of a blister to the pit of the stomach. A London\r\nSurgeon has lately stated that he has prescribed the tincture of\r\nDigitalis, in the dose of twenty-five drops, three times a day, in\r\nbarley-water, with great success in Gonorrhæa. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS.\r\n_Infus: Digitalis_. L.E. _Tinct: Digital:_ L.E.D. _Decoct: Digitalis:_\r\nD. It is very important that the leaves of this plant be properly\r\ncollected, and accurately preserved; they should be gathered when the\r\nplant is beginning to flower, and, as it is biennial, in the second year\r\nof its growth; the largest and deepest coloured flowers should be also\r\nselected, for they are the most powerful; they should be also carefully\r\ndried until they become crisp, or they will lose much of their virtue;\r\nthe too common method of tying them in bundles, and hanging them up to\r\ndry, should be avoided, for a fermentation is produced by such means,\r\nand the parts least exposed soon become rotten. The powdered leaves\r\nought to be preserved in opaque bottles, and kept from the action of\r\nlight as well as of air and moisture; a damp atmosphere has, upon a\r\nprinciple already explained, a very injurious operation, by carrying off\r\nthose faint poisonous effluvia with which its efficacy seems to be\r\nultimately connected.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DULCAMARÆ CAULES.

This plant is much more\r\nappreciated on the continent than in this country; we rarely use it\r\nexcept in cutaneous affections; Professor Richter of Gottingen states\r\nthat he has employed it in _Phthisis Pituitosa_ with very extraordinary\r\nsuccess; and Sir A. Crichton says that in the few cases of chronic\r\ntubercular Phthisis in which he has given it, it appeared to increase\r\nthe powers of the Sarsaparilla with which it was usually combined.\r\nOFFICINAL PREP: _Decoct: Dulcam:_ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        ELATERII PEPONES. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                         (Momordica Elaterium.)\r\n\r\n                    _Wild_, or _Squirting Cucumber_.\r\n\r\nThis plant appears from the testimony of Dioscorides and other writers,\r\nto have been employed by the ancient physicians with much confidence and\r\nsuccess. All the parts of the plants were considered as purgative,\r\nalthough not in an equal degree; thus Geoffroy, “_radicum vis cathartica\r\nmajor est quam foliorum, minor vero quam fructuum_.” This question has\r\nvery lately been set at rest by the judicious experiments of Dr.\r\nClutterbuck,[493] which prove that the active principle of this plant\r\nresides more particularly in the juice which is lodged in the centre of\r\nthe fruit, and which spontaneously subsides from it; when this substance\r\nis freed from extraneous matter, it possesses very energetic powers, and\r\nappears to me to be entitled to consideration as a distinct proximate\r\nprinciple, which I shall venture to call _Elatin_. See _Extractum\r\nElaterii_.\r\n\r\n\r\n           ELEMI. L.D. (Amyris Elemifera. _Resina._) _Elemi._\r\n\r\nThis substance is what is generally termed a _gum-resin_; that is, a\r\ncompound consisting of gum, resin, and volatile oil: late researches\r\nhowever seem to shew that these bodies are compounds of a peculiar\r\ncharacter, consisting of a volatile substance, something between\r\nessential oil and a constituent which possesses the properties of\r\nextractive rather than those of gum.\r\n\r\nTrue Elemi has a fragrant aromatic odour, not unlike that of\r\nfennel-seeds, but more potent. _Sp. gr._ 1·0182. When powdered it mixes\r\nwith any unguent; it also combines with balsams and oils, and by the aid\r\nof heat, with turpentine. USES. It is only employed for forming the\r\n_mild digestive ointment_ which bears its name, viz. _Unguent: Elemi_\r\n_comp:_ L.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EMPLASTRA. L.E.D. Plasters.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which this form of preparation is to be constructed\r\nare fully detailed at p. 207.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM AMMONIACI. L. _Ammoniacum_ reduced to a suitable consistence\r\nby distilled vinegar. It adheres to the skin without irritating it, and\r\nwithout being attended with any unpleasant smell.[494] There is a\r\npeculiar disease of the knee, to which servant maids, who scour floors\r\nupon their knees, are liable, and for which this plaster is a specific.\r\nI have also found it particularly eligible in cases of delicate women\r\nwith irritable skins.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM AMMONIACI CUM HYDRARGYRO. L.D. The mercury in this plaster is\r\nin the state of oxidation _ad minimum_. It is discutient and resolvent,\r\nand is applicable to indurated glands, and venereal nodes, and for\r\nremoving indurations of the periosteum, remaining after a course of\r\nmercury; the addition of the ammoniacum increases the stimulating and\r\ndiscutient powers of the mercury, which gives this plaster a superiority\r\nover the _Emplastrum Hydrargyri_. It is also powerfully adhesive.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM ASSAFŒTIDÆ. E. Emplast. Plumbi and Assafœtida, of each _two\r\nparts_, galbanum and yellow wax, of each _one part_. I have seen it\r\nuseful in flatulent cholic, when applied over the umbilical region.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM CANTHARIDIS. L. _Emplast: Cantharidis vesicatoriæ._ E.D. A\r\nvariety of substances has in different times been employed for producing\r\nvesication, but no one has been found to answer with so much certainty\r\nand mildness as the _Lyttæ_. All the others are apt to leave ill\r\nconditioned ulcers: true it is, that the emplastrum lyttæ will\r\noccasionally fail, but this is generally attributable to some\r\ninattention, or want of caution on the part of the person who prepares\r\nit; in spreading it, the spatula should never be heated beyond the\r\ndegree of boiling water; the plaster also should be sufficiently secured\r\non the part by slips of adhesive plaster, but it ought not to be bound\r\non too tight; where the cuticle is thick, the application of a poultice\r\nfor an hour, previous to that of the blister, will be useful, or the\r\npart may be washed with vinegar. In consequence of the absorption of the\r\nactive principle of the _Lyttæ_, blisters are apt to occasion strangury\r\nand bloody urine; it has been a problem therefore of some importance to\r\ndiscover a plan by which such an absorption may be obviated, for this\r\npurpose, camphor has been recommended to be mixed with the blistering\r\ncomposition, and a piece of thin gauze has been interposed between the\r\nplaster and the skin; but it has been lately found, that ebullition in\r\nwater deprives the _Cantharides_ of all power of thus acting on the\r\nkidneys, without in the least diminishing their vesicatory properties:\r\nthe ordinary time required for the full action of a blister is ten or\r\ntwelve hours, but if it be applied to the head, double that period will\r\nbe necessary. Children, owing to delicacy of skin, are more speedily\r\nblistered, the epispastic may therefore be removed earlier. In some\r\ncases the blistered parts, instead of healing kindly, become a spreading\r\nsore; whenever this occurs, poultices are the best applications; it may\r\narise from a peculiar irritability of the constitution, although I\r\napprehend that it not unfrequently depends upon the sophistication of\r\nthe plaster with euphorbium. In cases where it is desirable to keep up\r\nthe local irritation, it is still a question with some practitioners\r\nwhether it be more advisable to encourage a discharge from the vesicated\r\npart by some appropriate stimulant, or to renew the vesication at short\r\nintervals by repeated blisters; the latter mode is perhaps to be\r\npreferred, as being more effectual, and certainly less troublesome to\r\nthe patient: it has moreover been stated,[495] that by a repeated\r\napplication of this nature, the influence excited appears to extend much\r\ndeeper, so as to derive a greater quantity of blood from the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the vessels, or from the vessels themselves which are\r\nin a state of disease, than the influence excited by an application less\r\nstimulating upon the surface of a part already abraded. The character of\r\nthe discharge would likewise appear essentially different; it being in\r\nthe latter cast a purulent secretion from the superficial exhalants of\r\nthe surface only; in the former, a copious effusion of serum, mixed with\r\na large portion of lymph, produced from a deeper order of vessels.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM CERÆ. L. _Emplast: Simplex_. E. This is the _Emplast: Ceræ_\r\nof P.L. 1787, the _Emplast: Attrahens_ of 1745, so called because it was\r\nformerly employed to keep up a discharge from a blistered surface, and\r\nthe _Emplastrum de melilolo simplex of_ 1720.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM CUMINI. L. A valuable combination of warm and stimulant\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM GALBANI COMPOSITUM. L.D. _Emplast: Gummos_. E. More powerful\r\nthan the preceding plaster. In indolent glandular enlargements of a\r\nstrumous character, in fixed and long continued pains in the\r\nneighbourhood of the joints, or in anomalous or arthritic pains of the\r\nligaments, this plaster is said to be frequently beneficial.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM HYDRARGYRI. L.E. The mercury in this plaster is in the state\r\nof oxidation _ad minimum_; each drachm containing about fifteen grains\r\nof mercury, (_sixteen grains_, _Edinb._) It is alterative, discutient,\r\nand sometimes sialogogue; but it is inferior to the _Emplast: Ammoniac:\r\ncum Hydrargyro_.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM OPII. L.E. This plaster is supposed to be anodyne, but it is\r\nvery doubtful whether the opium _can_, in such a state, produce any\r\nspecific effect. See _Form: 5_.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM PICIS COMPOSITUM. L. _Emplast: Picis burgundicæ_, P.L. 1787.\r\nIt is stimulant and rubefacient, and is often employed as an application\r\nto the chest, in pulmonary complaints; the serous exudation however\r\nwhich it produces, frequently occasions so much irritation that we are\r\ncompelled to remove it.\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM PLUMBI. L. _Emplast: Oxydi Plumbi semi-vitrei._ E. _Emplast:\r\nLythargyri._ P.L. 1787. _Emplast: commune_, 1745. _Diachylon_[496]\r\n_Simplex_, P.L. 1720. This is a very important plaster, since it forms\r\nthe basis of a great many others; under the name of _Diachylon_ it has\r\nlong been known, and employed as a common application to excoriations,\r\nand for retaining the edges of fresh cut wounds in a state of\r\napposition, and at the same time for defending them from the action of\r\nthe air; when long kept it changes its colour, and loses its adhesive\r\nproperties, and by high temperature the oxyd of lead is revived.[497]\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM RESINÆ. L. Olim, _Emplast: commune adhæsivum_, P.L. 1745.\r\n_Emplast: Resinosum_. E. _Emplast: Lithargyri cum Resina._ D. It is\r\ndefensive, adhesive, and stimulant.[498]\r\n\r\nEMPLASTRUM SAPONIS. L.D. _Emplastrum Saponaceum._ E. The Soap Plaster is\r\nsaid to be a mild discutient application.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EUPATORIUM PERFOLIATUM.\r\n\r\n                                Boneset.\r\n\r\n                           _Herba et flores._\r\n\r\n[The boneset is a plant indigenous to the United States, and is to be\r\nfound in the neighbourhood of marshes and low situations. It is\r\nintensely bitter and somewhat astringent. According to the analysis of\r\nDr. Andrew Anderson of New-York, it yields, 1. A free acid; 2. Tannin;\r\n3. Extractive matter; 4. A gummy matter; 5. A resin; 6. Azote; 7. Lime,\r\nprobably the acetate of lime; 8. Gallic acid, probably modified; 9. A\r\nresiniform matter, soluble in water and in alcohol, and which seems to\r\ncontain a bitter principle. It also appears from this analysis that the\r\nfree acid may be obtained from all parts of the plant—that tannin is\r\nobtained in much the largest quantity from the leaves, and least from\r\nthe roots—that the extractive and gummy matter reside chiefly in the\r\nroots—that the leaves and flowers also contain a larger proportion of\r\nresin than the roots—and that azote exists in the flowers, leaves, and\r\nroots. The principal properties of the boneset are those of a tonic and\r\ndiaphoretic. The diseases in which it has been prescribed with success\r\nare intermitting and remitting fevers, typhoid peripneumony and catarrh.\r\nIt may be given in powder, infusion, or tincture. When given as a tonic,\r\nthe tincture is the preferable form. The dose of the powder is from 20\r\nto 30 grains. When used as a sudorific, it is to be taken in infusion,\r\nand in large quantities.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         EUPHORBIA IPECACUANHA.\r\n\r\n                     American Ipecacuanha. _Radix._\r\n\r\n[This plant is peculiar to the United States. The root is perennial, and\r\nof a sweetish taste. By analysis it yields caoutchouc, resin, mucus, and\r\nfecula. In its medicinal properties it resembles, and perhaps equals,\r\nthe common ipecacuanha. As an emetic the dose is from 15 to 25 grains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       EUPHORBIÆ GUMMI-RESINA. L.\r\n\r\n                 (Euphorbia Officinarum.) _Euphorbium._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This substance is imported from Barbary, in drops or\r\nirregular tears; its fracture is vitreous; it is inodorous, but yields a\r\nvery acrid burning impression to the tongue. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is\r\nwhat is termed a _gum resin_, but its acrid constituent is exclusively\r\nin that portion which is soluble in alcohol, and which might be named\r\n_Euphorbin_; it appears to form as much as 37 per cent. to which are\r\nadded of wax 19, malate of lime 20·5, malate of potass 2, and water 5.\r\nSOLUBILITY. Water by trituration is rendered milky, but dissolves only\r\none-seventh part; and alcohol one-fourth of it. USES. Internally\r\nadministered, it proves very violently drastic, but it is never employed\r\nexcept as an errhine, cautiously diluted with starch, or some inert\r\npowder. The Indian practitioners administer it as a purge in obstinate\r\nvisceral obstructions; and in those cases of costiveness which so often\r\nattend an enlargement and induration of the spleen and liver. Farriers\r\nuse it for blistering horses, and there is good reason to believe that\r\nit is sometimes fraudulently introduced to quicken the powers of our\r\nEmplastrum Cantharidis. It enters as an ingredient into a plaster, which\r\nhas been much celebrated by Cheselden and others, as a stimulating\r\napplication, to relieve diseases of the hip-joint, and to keep up\r\ninflammation of the skin in chronic states of visceral inflammation; the\r\nfollowing is its composition. ℞. _Emplast: Picis comp:_ ℥iv.—_Euphorbiæ\r\ngum-resinœ_ ʒss.—_Terebinth: Vulgar, q. s._ CAUTION, in pulverizing this\r\nsubstance, the dispenser should previously moisten it with vinegar to\r\nprevent its rising and excoriating his face.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      EXTRACTA. L.E.D. _Extracts._\r\n\r\nThese preparations are obtained by evaporating the watery or spirituous\r\nsolutions of vegetables, and the native juices obtained from fresh\r\nplants by expression, to masses of a tenacious consistence. The London\r\ncollege does not arrange the extracts under the titles of _watery_ and\r\n_resinous_, which is the arrangement of the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia, nor\r\nunder those of simple and resinous, which is the division observed in\r\nthat of Dublin, but rejecting all _specific_ distinctions, includes,\r\nunder the _generic_ appellation of extract, both the species, as well as\r\nall the _inspissated juices_. Since however the former of these\r\narrangements will afford greater facilities for introducing the\r\nobservations which it is my intention to offer, it is retained in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe chemical nature of extracts must obviously be very complicated and\r\nvariable, depending in a great degree upon the powers of the _menstruum_\r\nemployed for their preparation; although Fourcroy and Vauquelin\r\nconsidered that _one peculiar_ principle was the basis of them all,\r\nwhich they called _Extract_, _Extractive_, or the _Extractive\r\nPrinciple_. It is distinguished by the following characters, _viz_.\r\n\r\nIt has a strong taste, varying in different plants; it is soluble in\r\nwater, and in alcohol when it contains water, but is quite insoluble in\r\n_absolute_ alcohol and æther; its aqueous solution soon runs into a\r\nstate of putrefaction; by repeated solutions and evaporations, or by\r\nlong ebullition, it acquires a deeper colour, and in consequence of its\r\ncombination with oxygen it becomes insoluble and inert, a fact which is\r\nof extreme importance as it regards its pharmaceutical relations; it\r\nunites with alumine, and if boiled with its salts, precipitates it,\r\nhence wool, cotton, or thread, impregnated with alum, may be dyed of a\r\nfawn-colour by _extractive_; its habitudes with alkalies are very\r\nstriking, combining most readily and forming with them compounds of a\r\nbrownish yellow colour, which are very soluble in water; if to a\r\ncolourless and extremely dilute solution of extractive, an alkali be\r\nadded, a brown or yellowish tint is immediately produced, so that under\r\ncertain circumstances I have found an alkali to be a serviceable test in\r\ndetecting the presence of extractive matter. The usual brown hue of the\r\n_liquor ammoniæ acetatis_, is owing to the action of the ammonia upon\r\ntraces of vegetable extractive contained in the distilled vinegar.\r\n\r\nMuch confusion has arisen from the word _extract_ having been employed\r\nin this double meaning,—_chemically_ to express a peculiar vegetable\r\nproximate principle, and _pharmaceutically_ to denote any substance\r\nhowever complicated in its nature, which has been obtained by the\r\nevaporation of a vegetable solution or a native vegetable juice. It is\r\nin the latter sense that it is to be understood in the present article.\r\n\r\nThe different proximate principles of vegetable matter undergo various\r\nand indefinite changes with such rapidity, when acted upon by heat, that\r\nthe process of _extraction_ must necessarily more or less impair the\r\nmedicinal efficacy of a plant, and not unfrequently destroy it\r\naltogether, and hence, says Dr. Murray, “with the exception of some of\r\nthe pure bitters, as gentian, or some of the saccharine vegetables, as\r\nliquorice, there is no medicine perhaps but what may be given with more\r\nadvantage under some other form;” this however is not exactly true, for\r\nwhen care is taken in the preparation, we are thus enabled to\r\nconcentrate _many_ very powerful qualities in a small space, and the\r\nprocess lately adopted of evaporating the solutions by the aid of steam,\r\ncontributes very materially to obviate the failures which so frequently\r\noccurred from a too exalted temperature. There is, for instance, great\r\nreason to suppose that the black colour which so often characterises the\r\nextracts of commerce, is frequently owing to the decomposition and\r\ncarbonization of the vegetable matter; the colour therefore of an\r\nextract becomes in some degree a test of its goodness. I have lately\r\nexamined the extracts of commerce with some attention, and I find the\r\npresence of iron by no means an uncommon circumstance; when thus\r\ncontaminated they afford a very dirty coloured solution, which rapidly\r\nbecomes darker on exposure to air. The extracts mentioned in the preface\r\nas made by Mr. Barry, by _evaporating in vacuo_, deserve the attention\r\nof the profession; the principle is without doubt well calculated to\r\nsecure the active matter of the plant from those changes to which it is\r\nconstantly liable during the ordinary operation of inspissation. The\r\nextracts, thus prepared, are certainly more powerful in their effects,\r\nand some few of them appear also to possess properties which are not to\r\nbe distinguished in the Extracts of Commerce; those of narcotic plants,\r\nas _Hemlock_, _Hyoscyamus_, _&c._ are decidedly more efficacious; where\r\nthe practitioner directs their use, he should, to prevent any mistake,\r\nadd the words _in vacuo præp._ as in _Formula 4_; for on account of the\r\ndifference in the strength of these preparations, and of those prepared\r\nby the ordinary method, they cannot be indiscriminately employed. Dr.\r\nJohn Davy, at my request, has made trial of these extracts in the\r\nMilitary Hospital at Fort Pitt, and as his results coincide with those\r\nobtained in my own practice, I shall relate, under the history of each\r\nExtract, the comparative conclusions which have been obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     1. WATERY OR SIMPLE EXTRACTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Mucilaginous_ Extracts of Rouelle.\r\n\r\nThese extracts must, of course, contain all the principles of a plant\r\nwhich are soluble in water, such as gum, extractive matter, tannin,\r\ncinchonin, sugar, fecula, &c. together with any soluble salts which the\r\nvegetable may contain. I have also found by experiment that an aqueous\r\nextract may even contain, in small proportions, certain elements which,\r\nalthough quite insoluble in water, are nevertheless partially soluble in\r\nvegetable infusion. This law of vegetable chemistry has never been\r\nexpressed, although we have repeated instances of its truth, and a\r\nknowledge of it may explain some hitherto unintelligible anomalies. It\r\nhas been stated that extractive matter is perfectly insoluble in æther,\r\nbut Mr. A. Thomson found repeatedly, that if a small portion of resin\r\nwas present, æther would in that case take up extractive in combination\r\nwith the resin which it so readily dissolves. As decoction or infusion\r\nis a process preliminary to that of extraction, the practitioner must\r\nrefer to those articles for an enumeration of the different sources of\r\nerror which are attached to them.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM ALOES PURIFICATUM. L. The resinous element of the aloes is got\r\nrid of in this preparation; on which account it is supposed, in an equal\r\ndose, to be more purgative and less irritating. _Dose_, gr. x to xv.\r\n_Form: 12, 13, 36._\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM ANTHEMIDIS. L.E. _Extract. Florum Chamœmeli._ D. This extract\r\nfurnishes an example of the change effected on some plants by the\r\nprocess of extraction; in this case the volatile oil is dissipated, and\r\na simple bitter remains, possessing scarcely any of the characteristic\r\nproperties of chamomile. This remark, however, does not apply to this\r\nextract, when prepared _in vacuo_. I have lately received from Mr. Pope\r\nof Oxford Street, a specimen which retains, in the most eminent degree,\r\nall the odour and taste of the recent flower. _Dose_, gr. x–℈j.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM CINCHONÆ. L.D. The properties of the bark in this preparation\r\nare much invalidated, owing to the oxidizement of its extractive matter,\r\nwhich takes place to such an extent, that not more than one half of the\r\npreparation is soluble in water; it is not however altogether devoid of\r\nutility, and will often sit lightly on the stomach, when the powder is\r\nrejected. Its taste is very bitter, but less austere than the powder.\r\nThe most beautiful extract of bark, which I have ever seen, was prepared\r\nby Mr. Barry of Plough Court; its colour was that of a deep brilliant\r\nruby, and its flavour preserved all the characteristic peculiarity of\r\nthe recent substance.[499] _Dose_, grs. x to ʒss. Fourteen ounces of the\r\nbark will yield about three ounces and a half of extract. It should be\r\nkept _soft_, so as to be fit for forming pills, and _hard_, so that it\r\nmay be reduced to powder.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM COLOCYNTHIDIS. L. This extract is much milder, although less\r\npowerful, than the pulp; _Dose_, grs. v to ʒss. It soon becomes hard and\r\nmouldy.[500]\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM GENTIANÆ. L.E.D. The bitter principle suffers no deterioration\r\nin the process: it is used principally as a vehicle for metallic\r\npreparations. _Form. 36, 53, 103._ _Dose_, gr. x to ℈j.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM GLYCYRRHIZÆ. L.D. It is usually imported from Spain; in the\r\ncoarser kinds, the pulps of various plums and of prunes are added; it\r\nshould dissolve in water without leaving any feculence.[501]\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM HÆMATOXYLI. L.E.D. The astringent properties of the _logwood_\r\nare preserved in the extract, but it becomes so extremely hard, that\r\npills made of it very commonly pass through the body without undergoing\r\nthe least change. _Dose_, grs. x to ʒss dissolved in cinnamon water: it\r\nsometimes imparts a bloody hue to the urine of those who have taken it.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM HUMULI. L. The bitter taste of the hop characterises this\r\npreparation; whether it possesses, or not, any anodyne properties, seems\r\nvery doubtful. _Dose_, grs. v to ℈j.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM OPII. L.D. As it contains less resinous matter than crude\r\nopium, it is supposed to produce its effects with less subsequent\r\nderangement. See _Opium_. _Dose_, gr. j to v, for an adult.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM PAPAVERIS. L.D. It is a weak opium. _Dose_, grs. ij to ℈j.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM SARSAPARILLÆ. Notwithstanding the reputation which this\r\npreparation has acquired, it is very doubtful whether it possesses any\r\nmedicinal powers. _Dose_, gr. x to ʒj in pills, or dissolved in the\r\ndecoction.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM STRAMONII. This extract was first recommended by Stöerck, as a\r\npowerful remedy in maniacal affections; its probable value in such\r\ndiseases appears to have been suggested by a very curious process of\r\nreasoning, viz. that as it deranged the intellect of the sane, it might\r\npossibly correct that of the insane. Experience has certainly not\r\nconfirmed the very sanguine report of Stöerck with regard to its powers,\r\nbut it has satisfactorily shewn its occasional value in violent\r\nparoxysms, in quieting the mind, and procuring rest. I am informed by my\r\nfriend Dr. Davy, that, for such an object, it has been very frequently\r\nand successfully given, in the Lunatic Military Hospital at Fort\r\nClarence. He farther states that he has himself made many trials with\r\nthe extract of Stramonium, prepared by Mr. Barry (_in vacuo_) as well as\r\nwith the common extract; and that he finds the former to be uniformly\r\nmore powerful. “In most diseases,” says he, “this medicine would seem\r\nuncertain in its operation, sometimes occasioning an anodyne effect,\r\nand, at other times, producing irritation, and preventing sleep; I have,\r\nhowever, seen very beneficial effects from it in asthma, and in coughs\r\nthat have a nightly exacerbation, in doses of from gr. 1/4 to gr. 2,\r\ndaily.”\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM TARAXACI. L.D. The medicinal powers of Dandelion are asserted\r\nto exist unimpaired in this preparation, but it becomes inert by\r\nkeeping. See _Taraxacum_. _Dose._ grs. x to ʒj, in combination with\r\nsulphate of potass.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 2. _Spirituous or Resinous Extracts._\r\n\r\nThese may contain, with the exception of gum, all the ingredients\r\ncontained in watery extracts, besides resin; their composition however\r\nwill greatly depend upon the strength of the spirit employed as the\r\nsolvent; but of this I shall speak more fully under the article\r\n_Tincture_.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM CINCHONÆ RESINOSUM. L.E.D. The operation of spirit in this\r\npreparation is two-fold; it extracts from the bark the element which is\r\ninsoluble in water, and it diminishes the tendency in the extractive\r\nmatter to absorb oxygen during the process. _Dose_, grs. x to xxx. It is\r\nsaid that a spurious extract of bark is to be met with in the market,\r\nconsisting of the extract of the horse-chesnut tree bark, and yellow\r\nresin.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM COLOCYNTHIDIS COMPOSITUM. L.D. _Extract. Catharticum._ P.L.\r\n1775. _Pilulæ Rudii._ P.L. 1720. This preparation has been established\r\nthrough successive pharmacopœias, and has undergone some modification in\r\neach; in the present edition the soap has been restored, and its\r\nsolubility is thereby increased, as well as its mildness as a cathartic.\r\nThe omission of this ingredient was formerly suggested by the\r\nconsideration of its being incompatible with _Calomel_; this however is\r\n_not_ the case. It presents a combination of purgative substances which\r\nis highly judicious, and will be found to be more powerful than an\r\nequivalent dose of any _one_ of the ingredients. _Dose_, gr. v to ʒss,\r\n_Form. 71, 81, 88._\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM JALAPÆ. L.E.D. It is purgative, but is liable to gripe, unless\r\nit be triturated with sugar and almonds, or mucilage, so as to form an\r\nemulsion. _Dose_, grs. x to ℈j.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM RHEI. L. The powers of the Rhubarb are considerably impaired\r\nin this extract. _Dose_, grs. x to ʒss. _Form. 78._\r\n\r\n\r\n                        3. _Inspissated Juices._\r\n\r\nThese preparations are obtained by expressing the juices from fresh\r\nplants, and evaporating them in a water-bath; they are generally of a\r\nlighter colour than common extracts, and they are certainly much more\r\nactive, although there is a great difference in the activity of\r\ndifferent samples; and perhaps the _medicinal_ powers of the juices\r\nthemselves are very much under the controul of soil and season. That\r\nthey _vary in quantity_ from such causes we have ample proof; thus in\r\nmoist seasons, Beaumé obtained five pounds of inspissated juice from\r\nthirty pounds of _elder berries_, whereas, in dry seasons, he could\r\nrarely get more than two. From _hemlock_ he procured in October, 1796,\r\n7·5 per cent. of inspissated juice, and in May of the same year only\r\n3·7; on the contrary, in August, 1768, 4 per cent., and in May, 1776, as\r\nmuch as 6·5; but in general, the product in the autumnal months was the\r\nmost considerable.\r\n\r\nThe modes of preparing the inspissated juices of the same plant vary in\r\nthe different pharmacopœias, and in several points that are very\r\n_essential_; some direct the expressed juices to be _immediately_\r\ninspissated, others allow them to undergo a slight degree of\r\nfermentation, and some _defecate_ them, before they proceed to their\r\ninspissation.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM (_Succus Spissatus._ E.) ACONITI. L.E. The medicinal\r\nproperties of this preparation are analogous to those of the recent\r\n_Wolfsbane_, viz. narcotic, and in some cases diuretic, (see _Form.\r\n128_.) It is however rarely used. _Dose_, at first, should not exceed\r\ngr. ½, but it may be gradually increased. I have not yet, says Dr. Davy,\r\nin a letter recently received from him, had much experience of the\r\n_Extractum Aconiti_, but that little is favourable to its use; “in some\r\ncases of chronic rheumatism, and in some of intermittent fever,\r\ncomplicated with visceral disease, it has had a beneficial effect not to\r\nbe mistaken; the dose has been from one to two grains.” Dr. Stöerck, who\r\nfirst tried this medicine, observed from it a powerful diaphoretic\r\neffect; this, says Dr. Davy, “I have not noticed, and yet the extract\r\nwhich I have used was prepared by Mr. Barry, _in vacuo_, which is\r\ncertainly far more powerful than that employed by Stöerck; the latter,\r\nwhen applied to the tongue, “_levissimam tantum titillationem\r\nexcitabat_,” whereas that of Mr. Barry produces a most disagreeable\r\nsensation of burning, which extends to the throat; and in one instance,\r\nwhen applied to the tip of my tongue, it occasioned ulceration.”\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM BELLADONNÆ. L.E. See _Belladonnæ Folia_. _Dose_, gr. j,\r\ngradually increased to gr. v, in the form of pill. Dr. Davy has made a\r\nfew trials of Barry’s Extract; the results of which he informs me are\r\nnot at all favourable to the use of this medicine; it is much more\r\npowerful than the common extract, and can only be given with safety in\r\nsmall doses; “in several instances,” says he, “I have not been able to\r\nrepeat a grain dose daily, more than thrice, on account of the alarming\r\nsymptoms produced, as head-ache, vertigo, indistinct vision with dilated\r\npupil, and, in one case, irritation of the bladder, occasioning very\r\nfrequent micturition; in chronic rheumatism and catarrh, with severe\r\ncough, the only diseases in which I have yet given it, it has not\r\nappeared to be in the least serviceable; it may probably prove valuable\r\nto the oculist; from trials that have been made of it here by Mr.\r\nMiller, Assistant Surgeon to the Forces, it has been found to dilate the\r\npupil beyond the common extract. Stöerck even introduced his extract\r\ninto the eye with impunity. Acrid as the preparation is which I have\r\nused, the patients have never complained of it, nor have I known any\r\ndisagreeable effects from it, when applied in solution, sufficiently\r\ndilute.”\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM (_Succus Spissatus._ E.D.) CONII. L. Much of this extract, as\r\nit is found in commerce, has not been prepared with equal fidelity, nor\r\nwith due attention to the season when the plant is in its greatest\r\nperfection; Dr. Fothergill says, “I know from repeated experiments, that\r\nthe extract which has been prepared from _hemlock_, before the plant\r\narrives at maturity, is much inferior to that which is made when the\r\nplant has acquired its full vigour, and is rather on the verge of\r\ndecline: just when the flowers fade, the rudiments of the seeds become\r\nobservable, and the habit of the plant inclines to yellow, _is the\r\nproper time_ to collect it;” the plants which grow in places exposed to\r\nthe sun should be selected, as being more _virose_ than those that grow\r\nin the shade: still however with every precaution, it will always be\r\nuncertain in strength. Orfila found that an extract prepared by boiling\r\nthe dried powder in water, and evaporating the decoction, was inert; in\r\nfact, the whole of the activity of the plant resides in a resinous\r\nelement _insoluble_ in water, and for which I have proposed the name of\r\n_Conein_. Extract of hemlock, when judiciously prepared, is a very\r\nvaluable sedative; I state this from ample experience, and when combined\r\nwith Hyoscyamus, and adapted by means of mucilage and syrup, to the form\r\nof a mixture, it affords a more effectual palliative than any remedy\r\nwith which I am acquainted, for coughs and pulmonary irritation. _Form.\r\n19._ is that from which I have derived the greatest benefit in such\r\ncases. See also _Form. 2, 3, 4, 19, 57_. Since the fourth edition of the\r\npresent work, I requested my friend Dr. John Davy to make trial of its\r\nefficacy in the Military Hospital at Chatham, and I here introduce his\r\nreport upon the subject;—“My experience of the effects of the _Extractum\r\nConii_ perfectly agrees with that of Dr. Paris, as stated in the fourth\r\nedition of the Pharmacologia, and I am of his opinion that when properly\r\nprepared, and administered, it is a very valuable sedative; I have given\r\nit to the extent daily of from a scruple to a drachm, in chronic\r\ncatarrh, and in phthisis pulmonalis, either alone or in conjunction with\r\nthe Extract of Hyoscyamus, and it has afforded more relief than any\r\nother medicine that I have tried. From two or three trials of it in\r\npneumonia, I am disposed to think it may be very serviceable in certain\r\nforms of this disease, in which venesection is contra-indicated by\r\nextreme debility; and also in measles. In the trials alluded to, I\r\ncommenced giving it in the large dose of a drachm, daily, suspended in\r\nwater containing in solution a grain of _Antimonium Tartarizatum_. In a\r\nvery few instances, where I have from the commencement given it in a\r\nlarge dose, as from ʒj to ʒiss, it has occasioned hallucination of\r\nideas, which in two cases was attended with excitement of the sensorium\r\nand increased action of the heart, and in one case, with diminished\r\nactivity of both. The Extract of Conium, prepared by Mr. Barry, is the\r\nmost powerful one I have ever used, indeed, until I tried it, I had no\r\njust idea of the virtues of Conium as a medicine; but I am now disposed\r\nto give credit to Stöerk’s account of its efficacy in various chronic\r\ndiseases; and I have no doubt but that this valuable medicine has fallen\r\ninto comparative disrepute and disuse from the bad quality of the\r\nextract commonly employed.” Dr. Maton has found that the value of this\r\nextract is greatly increased by including the seeds in its preparation.\r\n_Dose_, grs. v to ℈j; or more, twice or thrice a day; in a full dose it\r\nproduces giddiness, a slight nausea, and a tremor of the body; a\r\npeculiar heavy sensation is also experienced about the eyes; and the\r\nbowels become gently relaxed: unless some of these sensations are\r\nproduced, we are never sure that the remedy has had a _fair trial_ of\r\nits effects. Patients will generally bear a larger dose at night than at\r\nnoon, and at noon than in the morning.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM ELATERII. L. This substance spontaneously subsides from the\r\njuice of the wild cucumber, in consequence I presume of one of those\r\nseries of changes which vegetable matter is perpetually undergoing,\r\nalthough we are hitherto unable to express them by any known chemical\r\nlaw. It is therefore not an _extract_, either in the chemical or\r\npharmaceutical acceptation of the term, nor an _inspissated juice_, nor\r\nis it a _fecula_,[502] as it has been termed; the Dublin College has\r\nperhaps been more correct in simply calling it _Elaterium_, the name\r\ngiven to it by Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in commerce in little thin cakes, or broken pieces, bearing\r\nthe impression of the muslin upon which it has been dried; its _colour_\r\nis greenish, its _taste_ bitter, and somewhat acrid; and when tolerably\r\npure, it is light, pulverulent, and inflammable.\r\n\r\nThe early history of this medicinal substance is involved in great\r\nperplexity, each author speaking of a different preparation by the same\r\nname; for instance, the _Elaterium_ of Dioscorides must have been a very\r\ndifferent substance from that of _Theophrastus_; and, wherever\r\nHippocrates mentions the term, he evidently alludes to _any_ violent\r\npurgative. “_Hippocrati Elaterium medicamentum est quod per alvum\r\nexpurgat._” (_Bod: in Theophrast_.) This will, in some degree, reconcile\r\nthe discordant testimonies of different authors with regard to the\r\npowers of _Elaterium_; for example, Dioscorides states its dose to be\r\nfrom grs. ii to ℈j—in Ætius, Paulus, and Actuarius, it is recommended to\r\nthe extent of ʒss—in Mesue from ℈ss to ℈j—in Bontius (_Med: Ind:_) from\r\n℈j to ʒss—Massarias exhibits it in doses of gr. vj—Fernelius and\r\nSennertus to ℈j—Herman from grs. v vj—Quincy to grs. v—and Boerhaave\r\ndoes not venture to give more than gr. iv—while the practitioners of the\r\npresent day limit their dose from gr. ½ to grs. ij. Dr. Clutterbuck,\r\nwith a laudable intention to discover some method of procuring this\r\narticle at a cheaper rate, and at the same time of establishing some\r\nprocess which might ensure a preparation of more uniform strength, has\r\nlately performed a series of interesting and instructive\r\nexperiments,[503] the results of which prove in a satisfactory manner\r\n“that the active principle of this plant is neither lodged in the roots,\r\nleaves, flowers, nor stalks, in _any considerable quantity:_ nor is it\r\nto be found in the body of the fruit itself, or in the seeds, but in\r\n_the juice around the seeds_; the substance which spontaneously subsides\r\nfrom this liquor, obtained without pressure, is _genuine_ Elaterium, the\r\nquantity of which, contained in the fruit, is extremely small, for Dr.\r\nClutterbuck obtained only six grains from _forty_ cucumbers.” This\r\ngentleman communicated the detail of these experiments to the President\r\nof the College of Physicians, who requested me, as professor of Materia\r\nMedica, to report upon them. I accordingly deemed it to be my duty to\r\nenter upon a series of new experiments, which I have lately completed,\r\nwith the able assistance of Mr. Faraday, in the laboratory of the Royal\r\nInstitution. The results of which will shew, that although Dr.\r\nClutterbuck found that an _eighth_ part of a grain of elaterium seldom\r\nfailed to _purge violently_, yet, strange as it may appear, that _not\r\nmore than one grain in ten_ of elaterium, as it occurs in commerce,\r\npossesses any active properties, and that this decimal part is a\r\nvegetable proximate principle, not hitherto noticed, to which I shall\r\ngive the name of ELATIN. I shall subjoin the detail of my experiments,\r\nand I think it will appear that their results will authorise me to\r\nexpress the chemical composition of Elaterium in the following manner.\r\n\r\n                      F.

Series 1st._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   A.\r\n\r\n  Ten grains of Elaterium, obtained from a respectable chemist, and\r\n  having all the sensible properties which indicated it to be genuine,\r\n  were digested for twenty-four hours with distilled water, at a\r\n  temperature far below that of boiling; _four grains_ only were\r\n  dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   B.\r\n\r\n  The solution was intensely bitter, of a brownish yellow colour, and\r\n  was not in the least disturbed by alcohol, although a solution of\r\n  _Iodine_ produced a blue colour; the solution therefore contained no\r\n  gum, and only _slight traces_ of starch.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   C.\r\n\r\n  The solution, after standing twenty-four hours, yielded a _pellicle_\r\n  of insoluble matter, which when burnt appeared to resemble _Gluten_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   D.\r\n\r\n  The six grains which were insoluble in water, were treated for\r\n  forty-eight hours with alcohol of the specific gravity ·817, at 66°\r\n  of Fahrenheit; a green solution was obtained, but by slow\r\n  evaporation only _half a grain_ of solid green matter was procured.\r\n  The insoluble residue obstinately adhered to, and coated the filtre\r\n  like a varnish, and completely defended the mass from the action of\r\n  the alcohol; it is probable that it consisted principally of\r\n  _Starch_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       _Experiments. Series 2d._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   E.\r\n\r\n  Ten grains of Elaterium, from the same sample, were treated with\r\n  alcohol of the specific gravity ·817, at 66° Fahrenheit, for\r\n  twenty-four hours; upon being filtered, and the residuum washed with\r\n  successive portions of alcohol, the Elaterium was found to have lost\r\n  1·6 of _a grain_. The high specific gravity of the alcohol in this\r\n  experiment was important; had it been lower, different results would\r\n  have been produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   F.\r\n\r\n  The alcoholic solution obtained in the last experiment, was of a\r\n  most brilliant and beautiful green colour, resembling that of the\r\n  oil of cajeput, but brighter; upon slowly evaporating it, 1·2\r\n  _grains_ of solid green matter were obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   G.\r\n\r\n  The solid green matter of the last experiment was treated with\r\n  boiling distilled water, when a minute portion was thus dissolved,\r\n  and a solution of a most intensely bitter taste, and of a brownish\r\n  yellow colour, resulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   H.\r\n\r\n  The residue, insoluble in water, was inflammable, burning with smoke\r\n  and an aromatic odour, not in the least bitter; it was soluble in\r\n  alkalies, and was again precipitated from them unchanged in colour;\r\n  it formed, with pure alcohol, a beautiful tincture, which yielded an\r\n  odour of a very nauseous kind, but of very little flavour, and which\r\n  gave a precipitate with water; it was soft, and of considerable\r\n  specific gravity, sinking rapidly in water; circumstances which\r\n  distinguish it from common resin; in very minute quantities it\r\n  purges. It appears to be the element in which the purgative powers\r\n  of the Elaterium are concentrated, and which I have denominated\r\n  ELATIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\n  The residuum, insoluble in alcohol, weighing 8·4 grs.

E) was\r\n  boiled in double distilled water, when 5·9 grs. were dissolved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   J.\r\n\r\n  The above solution was copiously precipitated blue by a solution of\r\n  Iodine, and was scarcely disturbed by the Per-sulphate of Iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   K.\r\n\r\n  The part insoluble, both in alcohol and water, which was left after\r\n  Experiment I, amounting to 2·5 grains; it burnt like wood, and was\r\n  insoluble in alkalies.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the whole of the _Elatin_ does not separate itself from\r\nits native juice by spontaneous subsidence, and that, on this account,\r\nthe supernatant liquor possesses some powers as a cathartic. We cannot\r\nbe surprised therefore that the _Elaterium_ of commerce should be a very\r\nvariable and uncertain medicine; for independent of the great temptation\r\nwhich its high price holds out for adulterating it, which is frequently\r\ndone with starch, it necessarily follows that where the active principle\r\nof a compound bears so small a proportion to its bulk, it is liable to\r\nbe affected by the slightest variation in the process for its\r\npreparation, and even by the temperature of the season; where pressure\r\nis used for obtaining the juices, a greater or less quantity of the\r\ninactive parts of the cucumber will be mixed with the _Elatin_, in\r\nproportion to the extent of such pressure, and the _Elaterium_ will of\r\ncourse be proportionally weak.[504] There is one curious result obtained\r\nin my experiments which deserves notice, _viz._ that there is a _bitter_\r\nprinciple in the Elaterium, very distinct from its extractive matter,\r\nand totally unconnected with its activity, for I diluted the solution\r\nobtained in experiment G. and swallowed it, but it produced upon me no\r\neffect, except that which I generally experience upon taking a powerful\r\nbitter,—an increased appetite; and yet notwithstanding this fact, when\r\nin combination with _Elatin_, it is far from being inert, since this\r\nlatter body is considerably quickened by its presence. See page 152. The\r\nsolution B was given to a person, but no effect whatever ensued. _Dose_\r\nof good _Elaterium_, as it occurs in commerce, is about one grain, or it\r\nis better to give it only to the extent of half a grain at a time, and\r\nto repeat that dose every hour until it begins to operate. It is\r\nprobably, when thus managed, the best hydragogue cathartic which we\r\npossess; it differs however from the class of remedies to which it\r\nbelongs, for it excites the pulse and whole animal system, so as to\r\nproduce a considerable degree of febrile action. It was strongly\r\nrecommended by Sydenham, Lister, and Hoffman, and all their\r\ncotemporaries and immediate successors, as a valuable remedy in dropsy;\r\nbut in consequence of some fatal results from its improper application,\r\nit was driven from practice with a violence that marks prejudice rather\r\nthan conviction; one author, in descanting upon its virulence, exclaims,\r\n“_Elaterium esse in catalogo diaboli quo necat homines_.” For its\r\nrestoration to medicine, we are indebted to Dr. Ferriar of Manchester,\r\nwho used it with great success in the cure of Hydrothorax.\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM (_Succus Spissatus._ E.D.) HYOSCYAMI. L. This preparation is\r\ncertainly powerfully narcotic, and tends to relax rather than astringe\r\nthe bowels; where the constitution is rebellious to opium, it furnishes\r\na more valuable resource to the practitioner than any other narcotic\r\nextract. _Dose_, gr. v to ℈j, in pills. _See Form. 1, 3, 4, 19, 139._\r\n\r\nEXTRACTUM LACTUCÆ. L. SUCCUS SPISSATUS LACTUCÆ SATIVÆ. E. This\r\npreparation has found its way into the London Pharmacopœia, in\r\nconsequence of the testimony of many highly respectable practitioners in\r\nfavour of its sedative properties. In the memoirs of the Caledonian\r\nHorticultural Society, various suggestions are offered as to the best\r\nmode of obtaining an extract from the milky juice of the garden Lettuce,\r\nto which Dr. Duncan has bestowed the name of “LACTUCARIUM;” it was first\r\nrecommended to take the milk with cotton, afterwards with a sponge, and\r\nmore recently with a painter’s brush; all these methods however are\r\nattended with considerable difficulty, and the juice cannot be collected\r\nin any quantity. Mr. Probart, a chemist in Great Portland Street, has\r\nlately cultivated large plantations of the lettuce, for the purpose of\r\ninstituting experiments upon the subject, and I am happy in being\r\nenabled through his liberality, to introduce in this place, an account\r\nof the process which he pursues, and which he considers the only one by\r\nwhich the article can be brought into the market at any reasonable\r\nprice.[505]\r\n\r\nIn concluding the history of Inspissated juices, it deserves notice that\r\nthe London College uniformly directs that the _feculence_ should be\r\npreserved in the compound: there can be no doubt of the propriety of\r\nsuch advice, but the Colleges of Edinburgh and Dublin reject it. The\r\nFrench Codex gives directions for two extracts from each of these\r\nsubstances, one containing what they please to denominate the _fecula_,\r\nthe other not; thus there is “_Extractum Cicutæ absque Fecula_” and\r\n“_Extract: Cicut: cum Fecula_.” There is one curious fact respecting\r\nthese narcotic preparations, that most, if not all of them, contain\r\n_nitre_, _common salt_, and _muriate of potass._\r\n\r\nManufacturing chemists, in order to give a smooth and glossy appearance\r\nto their Extracts, generally add to every ℔j, about ʒss of gum, fʒj of\r\nolive oil, and ♏︎xx of rectified spirit; there is no harm in the\r\npractice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 FERRI SUB-CARBONAS.

QUALITIES.\r\n_Form_, a chocolate brown powder. _Odour_, none. _Taste_, slightly\r\nstyptic. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Mr. Phillips has shewn that this\r\nprecipitate is liable to vary according to the temperature at which it\r\nis prepared, as well as from other differences of manipulation; it\r\ngenerally consists of mixtures of peroxide, and proto-carbonate of iron,\r\nin the proportion of four parts of the latter, and six of the former. By\r\nreferring to the _Medicinal Dynameter_ the practitioner may find the\r\nquantity of those ingredients in any given weight of the preparation,\r\nand compare its strength with the other chalybeate medicines.\r\nSOLUBILITY. It is insoluble in water, but acids dissolve it with\r\neffervescence. _Forms of Exhibition._ In powder or pills, combined with\r\naromatics. DOSE, gr. v to xxx. (_Form. 38._) It has lately been brought\r\ninto particular notice by the publication of Mr. Hutchinson of\r\nSouthwell, who states that in doses of half a drachm to a drachm, two or\r\nthree times a day, it has proved in his hands a most efficacious remedy\r\nin the cure of _Tic doloureux_. Mr. Hutchinson is well known to the\r\nprofession as a judicious and inquiring practitioner, and we are well\r\nsatisfied that he would not recommend any remedy to the attention of his\r\nbrethren, without a well grounded assurance of its efficacy; at the same\r\ntime it must be remembered that this disease is very frequently the\r\nconsequence of an irritation in some nerve, by the mechanical operation\r\nof osseous spiculæ; in such cases we cannot expect the sub-carbonate of\r\nIron to afford relief. A noble Marquis who lost his leg at Waterloo,\r\nsuffered excruciating pains in his face, in consequence of exfoliation\r\nin the stump, which were relieved as soon as the local irritation\r\nsubsided; and a late lamented physician appears to have owed his severe\r\nsufferings to the irritation produced on the brain by a bony\r\nexcrescence. I have little doubt if cases of _Tic doloureux_ were more\r\ncarefully examined, they would be frequently found to derive their\r\norigin from a similar source. If it were necessary I could add several\r\nof such instances to those already enumerated.[506]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   FERRI RAMENTA ET FILA. L. FILA ET\r\n\r\n                      LIMATURA.

Iron filings should be carefully\r\npurified by the application of the magnet, since those obtained from the\r\nwork-shops are generally mixed with copper and other metals. For\r\npharmaceutical purposes, iron wire should be preferred, as being the\r\nmost pure, since the softest iron only can be drawn, and Mr. Phillips\r\nhas shewn us, in his experiments upon the “_Ferrum Tartarizatum_” that\r\nsoft iron is more easily acted upon by Tartar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 FERRI SULPHAS.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. According to Dr. Thomson, it consists\r\nof 27·7 of sulphuric acid, 28·3 of protoxide of iron, and 45 of water; 8\r\nparts, however, of this water, exist in combination with the oxide of\r\niron. The Medicinal Dynameter will shew the proportion of protoxide in\r\nany given weight of this salt. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in two parts of\r\nwater at 60°, and three-fourths at 212°. The solution reddens vegetable\r\nblues. It is insoluble in alcohol; when however the iron is farther\r\noxidized, it becomes soluble in that menstruum.[507] INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. Every salt whose base forms an insoluble compound with\r\nsulphuric acid; _the earths, the alkalies and their carbonates_; _borate\r\nof soda_; _nitrate of potass_; _muriate of ammonia_; _tartrate of potass\r\nand soda_; _acetate of ammonia_; _nitrate of silver_; _sub-acetate and\r\nacetate of lead_; _and Soaps_. Whether the medicinal virtues of a salt\r\nof iron are injured by combination with astringent vegetable matter,\r\nseems to admit of doubt. Such substances have been usually ranked\r\namongst the _incompatibles_, but I am disposed to think without\r\nsufficient grounds, for I have frequently witnessed the salutary effects\r\nof iron when exhibited in this questionable state of combination—may not\r\nthe absorbents be more disposed to take up iron, when combined with\r\nvegetable matter, than when it is presented in a more purely mineral\r\nform?[508] MEDICINAL USES. Tonic, astringent, emmenagogue, and\r\nanthelmintic; in large doses, it occasions griping in the bowels. DOSE,\r\ngr. j to v, combined with rhubarb, or some bitter extract. (_form: 72,\r\n87._) If given in solution, the water should be previously boiled, or\r\nthe oxygen contained in the atmospherical air, which is diffused through\r\nit, will partially convert the salt into an _oxy_-sulphat, and render it\r\ninsoluble. As an external astringent it is useful in the aphthæ of\r\nchildren.[509] OFFICINAL PREP. _Mist: Ferri comp:_ L. (=K=) _Pil: Ferri\r\ncomp:_ L.

This is very variable; depending upon the degree\r\nof heat and length of time employed for its preparation. It seems to be\r\na mixed mass, consisting of sub-muriate of ammonia and sub-muriate of\r\niron, the metal being in the state of red oxide; and, Mr. Phillips\r\nstates that in the London preparation a portion of sub-carbonate of\r\nammonia is necessarily present. The same chemist has also shewn that the\r\nproportion of Peroxide of iron in 200 grains is not more than three\r\ngrains. Its equivalents will be seen in the Medicinal Dynameter.\r\nSOLUBILITY, f℥j of water dissolves ʒiv of it; it is also very soluble in\r\nalcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _The Alkalies, and their Carbonates_;\r\n_Lime water_, and _Astringent vegetables_. MEDICINAL USES.

D.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a powder of a brownish green colour; _Odour_, none;\r\n_Taste_, slightly styptic; it attracts humidity from the atmosphere, but\r\ndoes not deliquesce. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Mr. Phillips has devoted much\r\nattention to this subject, and he states that as it is frequently\r\nprepared, it is a mere mixture of metallic iron with super-tartrate of\r\npotass, coloured by oxide of iron; when however it is made with more\r\ncare, it appears to be a double salt, consisting of tartrate of potass\r\nand tartrate of iron; or may it not be one of those combinations which\r\ncream of tartar forms with metals, and of which I have spoken under the\r\narticle _Antimonium Tartarizatum_? The quantity of peroxide of iron\r\ncontained in any weight of this preparation may be seen by referring to\r\nthe _Medicinal Dynameter_; five grains, for instance, will be found to\r\ncontain gr. j of peroxide, which, it will be observed, are equivalent to\r\n♏︎xiv of the _Tinctura Ferri Muriatis_, and to ♏︎xxv of the _Liquor\r\nFerri Alkalini_, or to f℥j of the _Vinum Ferri_. SOLUBILITY. It is very\r\nsoluble in water, and the solution remains for a great length of time\r\nwithout undergoing any change, except that of depositing _tartrate of\r\nlime_, which is an incidental impurity in the super-tartrate of potass.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _All strong acids_; _lime water_;\r\n_hydro-sulphuret of potass_; _astringent vegetables_? _The fixed\r\nalkalies and their carbonates_ decompose the solution very slowly,\r\nunless heated; but _ammonia_ and its _sub-carbonate_ produce upon it no\r\neffect, whether it be hot or cold; this fact, observes Mr. Phillips,\r\nwill enable us to exhibit iron in solution with an alkali, without the\r\noccurrence of an precipitate. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. The perfect\r\npreparation, from its tendency to deliquesce, cannot be well ordered in\r\nthe form of powder; that of solution is probably the most judicious.\r\nMED. USES. It is supposed to add to its chalybeate virtues those of a\r\ndiuretic nature. DOSE, grs. x to ʒss. See _Form: 34, 53, 92_. Dr.\r\nBateman has recommended a watery solution of it, as a chalybeate\r\npeculiarly suited to children, from its tasteless quality.[510]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         FILICIS RADIX. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                        (Aspidium Filix, _Mas._)\r\n\r\n                        Root of the _Male Fern_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This root is nearly inodorous; its taste slightly bitter,\r\nsweetish, sub-astringent, and mucilaginous; as it contains no volatile\r\ningredient, it may be given in decoction, but on account of its\r\nastringency, it must not be conjoined with a _chalybeate_. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. According to M. Morin, the Male Fern root owes its\r\nanthelmintic property to a fatty substance, capable of being saponified;\r\nof a nauseous odour quite like that of the root; of a very disagreeable\r\ntaste, heavier than water, and distilling with water, and when burnt,\r\ngiving a dense aromatic smoke. The root, moreover, contains gallic and\r\nacetic acids; uncrystallizable sugar; tannin; starch; a gelatinous\r\nmatter insoluble in water and alcohol; lignine; and various salts. M.\r\nMorin considers the fatty matter as formed of a fixed and a volatile\r\noil, but farther experiments are required to make the characteristic\r\nprinciple of this root better understood.

It is\r\none of those vegetable products to which the name of _gum-resin_ has\r\nbeen given, _see Elemi_. The latest analysis of galbanum by M. Meisner,\r\naffords the following results, Resin 65·8; Gum 22·6; Cerasin 1·8; Malic\r\nacid 0·2; Volatile oil 3·4; Vegetable Debris 2·8; loss 3·4. SOLUBILITY.\r\nWater, wine, and vinegar, by trituration, take up one-fourth of its\r\nweight, and form a milky mixture, which deposits its charge by rest; a\r\npermanent suspension, however, may be effected by the intermedium of egg\r\nor of gum arabic, for which purpose the galbanum will require half its\r\nweight of gum. Alcohol takes up one-fifth of its weight, and a golden\r\nyellow tincture results, which has the sensible qualities of the\r\ngalbanum, and becomes milky on the addition of water, but no precipitate\r\nfalls. A mixture of two parts of rectified spirit and one of water, will\r\ndissolve all but the impurities. By distillation, galbanum yields half\r\nits weight of volatile oil, which at first has a blue colour. MED.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Is at present involved in\r\nsome obscurity; it contains tannin, gallic acid, a concrete volatile\r\noil, and perhaps extractive and gum. M. Braconnot has also lately\r\ndiscovered in the gall-nut a new acid, which he calls _Ellagic acid_,\r\nfrom the word _galle_ reversed, a nomenclature which it must be\r\nconfessed is at least free from the objections urged against that which\r\nis founded upon chemical composition. (_See Annales de Chimie, vol. ix.\r\np. 187, new series_; also _Children’s Essay on Chemical Analysis, p.\r\n276_.) INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. The infusion and tincture of galls\r\npossess habitudes with which it is very important for the medical\r\npractitioner to be acquainted, not only for the purpose of directing\r\ntheir exhibition with success, but because the elements which impart to\r\nthem their characteristic traits, viz. _Gallic Acid_ and _Tannin_,[512]\r\nare very widely diffused through the products of the vegetable kingdom,\r\nand will be found to be constantly active in their chemical, medicinal,\r\nand pharmaceutical relations. Metallic salts, especially those of iron,\r\nproduce precipitates with infusion of galls, composed of tannin, gallic\r\nacid, and the metallic oxide; of these compounds the _tanno-gallate of\r\niron_ is the most striking, being of a black colour; those of\r\n_sub-acetate_ and _acetate of lead_ are greyish; _tartarized antimony_\r\nproduces a yellowish; _sulphate of copper_ a brown; _sulphate of zinc_\r\nreddish black; _nitrate of silver_, a deep olive; and _nitrate of\r\nmercury_, a bright yellow precipitate; the _oxy-muriate of mercury_\r\nproduces only an opacity. _Sulphuric acid_ throws down a yellowish curdy\r\nprecipitate, _muriatic_, a flaky and white one, and _nitric acid_ merely\r\nmodifies the colour of the infusion, although it destroys its\r\nastringency; the solution of _ammonia_ occasions no precipitate but\r\nrenders the colour deeper, the _carbonate_ however throws down a\r\nprecipitate; the carbonates of the _fixed alkalies_ produce a yellowish\r\nflaky, and _lime water_ a copious green precipitate. The _tannin_ in the\r\ninfusion of galls is precipitated by a solution of isinglass or of any\r\nother animal jelly, by that of starch, and by many metallic oxides.\r\nMEDICINAL USES. Galls are most powerfully astringent. The native\r\npractitioners of India not only administer them as astringents in\r\ndysentery, but as tonics in cases of intermittent fever. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. In that of powder; and in combination with other astringents\r\n(_Form. 51_,) or with aromatics and bitters. As a local remedy the\r\ngall-nut enters into gargles and injections; for _blind_ piles, an\r\nointment composed of 2½ parts of finely powdered galls, and a small\r\nportion of opium, with three parts of simple ointment as an excipient,\r\noffers a very valuable resource. (_Form. 55._) In some cases of\r\nhemorrhoids, prolapsus ani, and fluor albus, the application may be made\r\nin the form of a fomentation, for which purpose two drachms of bruised\r\ngalls should be macerated for an hour in a pint of boiling water, which,\r\nwhen cold, may be used in the usual manner.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gum,\r\nwith a peculiar modication of saccharine matter (_Glycion_), or sugar in\r\nits purest form, for it is not fermentable; on which account it is added\r\nto beer for the purpose of imparting a sweet taste, and at the same time\r\nenabling it to keep better.

It is principally employed as a\r\ndemulcent in combination with other mucilaginous vegetables; the root\r\nwill yield nearly half its weight of extract. Liquorice covers the taste\r\nof some unpalatable medicines more effectually than any other substance,\r\nand it has long enjoyed the reputation of assuaging thirst, whence the\r\nGreeks distinguished this root by the term _Adipson_; and, perhaps, the\r\nEnglish word _Liquorice_ may be derived from the same belief.

This wood is heavier than water, and emits when heated an\r\naromatic odour; _Taste_, bitterish and sub-acrid; to extract its virtues\r\nlong decoction is required. It has enjoyed great reputation as a\r\nspecific in the venereal disease; it was imported into Europe in 1517,\r\nand gained immediate celebrity from curing the celebrated Van Hutten:\r\nlong before this period, however, it was used by the natives of St.\r\nDomingo. Boerhaave, so late as the eighteenth century, maintained its\r\nspecific powers. It seems probable that the discipline which always\r\naccompanied its exhibition, such as sweating, abstinence, and purgation,\r\nmight be the means, in the warmer climates, of effecting cures which\r\nwere attributed to the guaiacum.

THE GUAIAC, or _Resin_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_; it has the aspect of a gum resin; _Colour_, greenish\r\nbrown; it is easily pulverized, and the powder, which is at first grey,\r\nbecomes green on exposure to air and light, which appears to depend upon\r\nthe absorption of oxygen: when heated, it loses its colour; it melts by\r\nheat; and has a _sp. grav:_ of 1·2289. SOLUBILITY. _Water_ dissolves out\r\nof it about 9 per cent. of extractive matter; _alcohol_ 95, and _æther_\r\n40 parts in a hundred. The _alkaline_ solutions and their _carbonates_\r\ndissolve it readily; _Sulphuric acid_ dissolves it with scarcely any\r\neffervescence, and affords a solution of a rich claret colour; _Nitric\r\nacid_ dissolves it with a copious extrication of nitrous fumes;\r\n_Muriatic acid_ dissolves a small portion only; but in all these cases\r\nthe guaiacum is decomposed; the acids are therefore incompatible with\r\nit. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The experiments of Mr. Hatchett demonstrate\r\nthat it is a substance _sui generis_, and not a resin, or gum-resin.\r\nMED. USES.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The\r\ncolouring matter of this wood has been very recently submitted to a\r\nrigid examination; and the name of _Hematin_ has been given to it; it\r\naffords small brilliant crystals of a reddish white colour, and slightly\r\nastringent, bitter, and acrid flavour; sulphuretted hydrogen passed\r\nthrough its solution in water, gives it a yellow colour, which\r\ndisappears in a few days. Gelatine throws it down in reddish flakes. The\r\nhabitudes of Logwood are curious with respect to mutability of colour.\r\nThe recent infusion, made with distilled water, is yellow, but that with\r\ncommon water has a reddish purple colour, which is deepened by the\r\nalkalies, and changed to yellow by the acids; various salts precipitate\r\nit; _acetate of lead_; _alum_; the _sulphates of copper and iron_;\r\n_tartarized antimony_; and _sulphuric_, _muriatic_, _nitric_, and\r\n_acetic acids_, are on this account incompatible with it. MED. USES. It\r\nis supposed to be astringent, and is therefore given in protracted\r\ndiarrhœas, and in the latter stage of dysentery. OFFICINAL PREP.\r\n_Extract.

The fibres of the root are the parts employed; they are about\r\nthe thickness of a straw, corrugated, externally of a deep dark colour,\r\nhence the epithet _black_; internally white, or of a yellowish hue.\r\n_Odour_, unpleasant; _Taste_, bitter and acrid. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. An\r\nanalysis of this root has lately been effected by M. M. Feneulle and\r\nCapron, from which it appears that its active principle, unlike that of\r\nthe White Hellebore (_Veratrum_) is not an alkali; the following\r\nsubstances enter into its composition, viz. 1. A Volatile Oil.—2. A\r\nFatty matter.—3. A Resin.—4. Wax.—5. A Volatile Acid.—6. A bitter\r\nprinciple.—7. Mucus.—8. Alumina.—9. Gallate of Potass.—10. Acidulous\r\nGallate of Lime.—11. A Salt, with an Ammoniacal base. SOLUBILITY. Both\r\nwater and alcohol extract its virtues, but the spirituous solution is\r\nthe most active; long coction diminishes its powers, hence the watery\r\nextract acts more mildly than the root. MEDICINAL USES. This is one of\r\nthe most ancient articles of the materia medica. Ctesias, who lived in\r\nthe time of Plato, and anterior to Hippocrates, speaks of it as a\r\nmedicine of important virtues. By the Greek and Roman physicians it was\r\nhighly esteemed as a remedy in Mania (_see p. 8._) The extraordinary\r\ncures performed at the island of Anticyrus, famous for its Hellebore,\r\nare celebrated by the poets and historians of antiquity. It is a drastic\r\ncathartic, and may prove therefore emmenagogue, and hydragogue, but in\r\nthis country, its reputation has been destroyed by the decided manner in\r\nwhich Dr. Cullen reprobated its use. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It is seldom\r\ngiven in substance, but in the form of tincture or extract; or in that\r\nof decoction, made with two drachms of the root to a pint of water.

The fact, with respect to the residence of the\r\nproperties of the hop in the yellow grains scattered over its scales,\r\nhas been since confirmed by the observations of M. Payen and A.\r\nChevalier, who have moreover detected a volatile oil in the Lupulin,\r\namounting to 2 per cent.; its proportion, however, appears to vary in\r\nthe Hop of different countries; the French hop, for instance, has been\r\nfound to contain more than the Belgic, but less than the English; Hops,\r\nmoreover, soon after having been picked, yield, _cæteris paribus_, more\r\noil and less resin than the old; a circumstance which induced M. M.\r\nPayen and Chevalier to suspect that the oil is capable of being\r\nresinified. (_Journal de Pharmacie, Juin 1822._) This oil is similar in\r\nodour to the hop, but much more penetrating, narcotic, and very acrid in\r\nthe throat.\r\n\r\nSOLUBILITY. Boiling water, alcohol, and æther, extract their virtues;\r\nbut their aromatic flavour is destroyed by decoction; like most\r\nvegetable bitters, the cold is more grateful than the warm infusion; its\r\ncolour is deepened by alkalies, and rendered turbid by the mineral\r\nacids; metallic salts also produce decomposition. MEDICINAL USES. Hops\r\nhave been said to be tonic, narcotic, and diuretic; they have been\r\nrecommended in the cure of rheumatism; and, like many articles in the\r\nmateria medica which have received the sanction of respectable\r\npractitioners, they have been extolled far beyond their merit. They\r\nundoubtedly possess the advantages of a pleasant bitter combined with a\r\nfeeble narcotic; the late Mr. Freake was very sanguine as to their\r\npowers, and at his request I made a series of experiments at the\r\nWestminster Hospital, but I confess that their results have not\r\nestablished my confidence in their efficacy. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS.\r\n_Extract. Humili._ L. _Tinct. Humili._ L. Their use as a preservative of\r\nbeer is well known, and the philosophy of their agency is fully\r\ndescribed in the first part of this work, (_page 168_); it is equally\r\nnotorious, that various vegetable substances are daily substituted for\r\nthem, such as _Quassia_[520] and _Wormwood_, both of which are inferior\r\nto the _Menyanthes Trifoliata_, or _Marsh Trefoil_. The people of Jersey\r\nare said to use the wood-sage, _Teucrium Scorodonia_; it imparts however\r\na very high colour to the beer. During the first four years that the\r\nCape of Good Hope was in the possession of the British, more than\r\n300,000 pounds of Aloes were imported into England; how could such a\r\nquantity be consumed? except, as Mr. Barrow states, by the London Porter\r\nbrewers; it must however be allowed that a considerable quantity of this\r\narticle is used by the Varnish makers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 HYDRARGYRUM.[521] L.D. HYDRARCYRUS. E.\r\n\r\n           Olim, Argentum vivum. _Mercury_, or _Quicksilver_.\r\n\r\nMercury, in its metallic state, is never applied to any medical\r\nuse,[522] except in visceral obstruction, in hopes of forcing a passage\r\nby its gravity; but under various forms of preparation, it affords a\r\nseries of very active remedies. ADULTERATIONS. With the exception of\r\nPeruvian Bark, there is perhaps no active article in the materia medica\r\nmore shamefully adulterated; its impurity is at once indicated by its\r\ndull aspect; by its tarnishing, and becoming covered with a grey film;\r\nby its diminished mobility, in consequence of which its globules are\r\nunable to retain the spherical form, and therefore _tail_, as it is\r\ntechnically expressed. _Lead_ is discovered by dissolving it in nitric\r\nacid, and adding to the solution water impregnated with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, when, if lead be present, a dark brown precipitate will ensue.\r\n_Bismuth_, by pouring the nitric solution into distilled water, when it\r\nwill appear as a white precipitate. _Zinc_, by exposing the mercury to\r\nheat. _Tin_ is detected by a dilute solution of nitro-muriate of gold,\r\nwhich throws down a purple precipitate. The presence of lead in mercury\r\nis a most dangerous circumstance; I have once witnessed a case of\r\n_cholica pictonum_ in consequence of it. The usual mode of purifying\r\nquicksilver, by pressing it through chamois leather, will not separate\r\nthe lead, if it be, as is generally the case, in combination with\r\nbismuth; for the manner in which the adulteration is effected, is by\r\nmelting with a gentle heat these two metals, and adding the alloy to the\r\nmercury; and although this alloy should exceed one-fourth of the whole\r\nbulk, it will pass, together with the mercury, through chamois leather.\r\nOn standing, the bismuth will be thrown upon the surface, in the form of\r\na dark powder, but the lead will remain in solution. The greatest part\r\nof the mercury of commerce comes from Istria and Friuli, and from the\r\nPalatinate, and as it passes through the hands of the Dutch, we must\r\nexpect to receive it in a state of alloy. On a superficial examination,\r\nit ought not, when shaken with water, to impart to it any colour; when\r\nagitated or digested with vinegar, it should not communicate a sweetish\r\ntaste; and when exposed in an iron spoon to heat, it ought to evaporate\r\nentirely. The French are so well aware of the mischievous extent to\r\nwhich this metal is falsified, that in their late Codex they direct the\r\nreduction of the _red oxyd_ in order to obtain it; the process however\r\nis too expensive for general adoption. The Italian Jews purify\r\nquicksilver for their barometers, by digesting it in dilute sulphuric\r\nacid, which is by no means an improper process. The mode directed for\r\nthe purification of mercury by the London College, (_Hydrargyrum\r\nPurificatum_) is unable to separate it _completely_ from its more\r\ndeleterious contaminations. It is a general opinion in Germany, that\r\nmercury, boiled in water, will impart to it an anthelmintic virtue;[523]\r\nthis, if it happens, can only depend upon the impurities of the mercury;\r\nbut large draughts of cold water are in themselves anthelmintic.\r\nAlthough metallic mercury in its fluid form exerts no effect upon the\r\nanimal system, it, nevertheless, in a state of vapour, manifests\r\nconsiderable powers; and it is necessary for the practitioner to be\r\ninformed that it assumes this condition at the ordinary temperature of\r\nthe atmosphere. I have stated several experiments in proof of this fact\r\nin my work on Medical Jurisprudence, _Art_. “_Aerial Poisons_,” to which\r\nthe reader may refer.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HYDRARGYRUM PRÆCIPITATUM ALBUM.

When pulverised and thrown\r\nupon burning coals, it is immediately volatilized, giving out a thick\r\nwhite smoke of a very pungent smell, which irritates the mucous\r\nmembranes extremely, and is highly dangerous to those who inhale it.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. According to the latest views, it is a\r\n_Bi-chloride_ of mercury, consisting of one proportional of mercury, to\r\ntwo proportionals of chlorine. In the French codex, it is termed\r\n“_Deuto-Chloruretum Hydrargyri_.” SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in eleven\r\nparts of cold, and in three of boiling water, and in half its weight of\r\nalcohol; it is also very soluble in æther; indeed this latter liquid has\r\nthe curious property of abstracting it from its solution in water, when\r\nagitated with it. Its solubility in water is greatly increased by the\r\naddition of a few drops of rectified spirit, or of muriatic acid. In a\r\nsolution of muriate of ammonia it is seventeen times more soluble than\r\nin water, no decomposition however arises; it is therefore probable that\r\na triple salt is formed; it is also soluble in the sulphuric, nitric,\r\nand muriatic acids, and may be obtained again unaltered, by simply\r\nevaporating the solutions. Dr. Davy, in his late researches upon\r\ncorrosive sublimate states that with muriatic acid, common salt, and\r\nsome other muriates, it forms definite compounds remarkable for their\r\nsolubility. Its watery solution is said to change vegetable blues to\r\ngreen, but this is an optical fallacy, (_see page 306_.) On exposure to\r\nlight this solution slowly undergoes decomposition; but Dr. Davy has\r\nshewn that corrosive sublimate remains unaltered when exposed in\r\nsolution in media having a strong affinity for it, as in alcohol, æther,\r\nmuriatic acid, &c. and that decomposition only takes place under\r\ncircumstances of complicated affinities, as in the instance of _Liquor\r\nHydrargyri Oxymuriatis_, and in that of the aqueous solution; in which\r\ncases Calomel and Muriatic acid appear to be formed, and oxygen to be\r\nevolved. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. The _carbonates of the fixed_ alkalies\r\nprecipitate it of a yellow hue, but the precipitates are not pure\r\noxides; _ammonia_ forms with it a white triple compound. _Lime water_\r\ndecomposes it more perfectly than any alkaline body, occasioning a\r\nprecipitate of a deep yellow colour,[524] which is a per-oxyd of mercury\r\ncontaining a little muriatic acid; this result forms a useful lotion to\r\nill conditioned ulcers, and has been long known under the title of _Aqua\r\nPhagadenica_; f℥j of lime water should be employed for the decomposition\r\nof two grains of the salt. _Tartarized antimony_, _nitrate of silver_,\r\n_acetate of lead_, _sulphur_, _sulphuret of potass_, and _soaps_,\r\ndecompose it. _Iron_, _lead_, _copper_, _bismuth_, and _zinc_, in their\r\nmetallic state, also decompose it, producing precipitates which consist\r\nof an amalgam of the metal employed, except in those cases where the\r\nmetal in question refuses to amalgamate with mercury, when this latter\r\nmetal appears as a metallic dew, composed of very minute globules, with\r\ncalomel; hence mortars of glass or earthenware should be used for\r\ndispensing this article; when triturated with olive oil, the oil becomes\r\nwhite, and when boiled with it, _calomel_ is precipitated; the same\r\nhappens if sugar be substituted for oil. The volatile oils reduce it.\r\nWhen Oil of Turpentine was used, some traces of artificial camphor was\r\ndiscovered by Dr. Davy, and when the oils of Cloves and Peppermint, a\r\npurple compound distilled over, consisting of the oil employed and\r\nmuriatic acid. The following vegetable infusions produce precipitates,\r\nviz. _the infusions and decoctions of chamomile_, _horse-radish root_,\r\n_calumba root_, _catechu_, _cinchona_, _rhubarb_, _senna_, _simarouba_,\r\n_oak bark_, _tea_ and _almond emulsion_. Swediaur observes, that “many\r\nauthors have recommended _sublimate_ combined with bark, but that a\r\nreciprocal decomposition is thus produced, by which the energies of both\r\nremedies are alike annulled;” to this ignorance, however, he thinks that\r\nmany patients have been indebted for their lives; for, says he, “I see\r\nevery day examples of weak and very delicate persons of both sexes, to\r\nwhom ignorant practitioners prescribe, and sometimes in very large\r\ndoses, the _corrosive sublimate_, with a decoction of bark; certainly\r\nwithout curing the syphilis, but at the same time without occasioning\r\nthose grave and dangerous symptoms, which that acrid medicine would\r\ncertainly produce, if given alone, or without that decoction.” We have\r\nhere presented the reader with the opinion of Swediaur; but it is just\r\nto state, that the experience of this country has rather tended to\r\nsubvert, than to confirm, such a belief. That the corrosive sublimate of\r\nmercury is actually decomposed by the vegetable principles of the bark\r\nis sufficiently evident, but it would seem that the oxide thus\r\ndeveloped, and recombined with vegetable extractive, is a very active\r\nmercurial, especially with respect to its alterative powers. The same\r\nobservation will, to a certain extent, apply to the results of its\r\ndecomposition by other agents; the fixed alkalies have been found by\r\nactual experiment to be incapable of disarming this salt of its\r\nvirulence, because, as Orfila has stated, the oxide liberated is, in\r\nitself, an active poison. Mr. Rose has lately transmitted to me a\r\nformula for the preparation of “_Alterative Drops_,” which he states,\r\nfrom ample experience, to possess very considerable powers as a\r\nmercurial, and to excite ptyalism, with a quickness and certainty which\r\ncharacterize but few preparations of the same class. The principal\r\ningredients are an alcoholic solution of _corrosive sublimate_ and a\r\nvinous solution of tartarized antimony. It is scarcely necessary to\r\nobserve that upon admixture a mutual decomposition takes place; the\r\n_peroxide of mercury_ is precipitated by the alkaline element of the\r\nantimonial compound, whilst this latter salt, having its affinities thus\r\noverthrown, parts with the _protoxide of antimony_; so that the\r\npreparation holds a considerable quantity of insoluble matter in\r\nsuspension, and which is to be carefully incorporated with the liquid by\r\nshaking the phial, whenever the drops are administered. Now there can be\r\nbut little doubt but that the activity of this preparation is owing to\r\nthe _peroxide of mercury_, thus diffused in a state of minute division,\r\nwhile at the same time the antimonial protoxide very probably disposes\r\nthe stomach and system to be more readily influenced by it, for reasons\r\nwhich have been fully discussed in the first part of this work, p. 152.\r\nMED. USES. It is one of the most acrid and active of all metallic\r\npreparations; in well directed doses, however, it is frequently of\r\nservice in secondary syphilis, and in cases of anomalous disease, when\r\nit would be improper to administer the other forms of mercury.[525] In\r\nobstinate cutaneous diseases its administration in small doses is often\r\nvery serviceable; I have, however, seen extreme emaciation and hectic\r\nfever produced by its too long continued exhibition, although ptyalism\r\nwas never occasioned. Its application also as a lotion to leprous\r\naffections, in the proportion of about one grain to a fluid-ounce and a\r\nhalf of some liquid vehicle, I have frequently seen highly beneficial;\r\nin directing the use of so acrid a lotion, we should caution the patient\r\nnot to touch his eyes until his hands have been washed; in consequence\r\nof a neglect of this kind I have seen a very severe ophthalmia produced.\r\nThe practitioner should also remember that the system may become\r\naffected by such external applications; a case stands recorded in which\r\na girl of five years old became salivated, and died, in consequence of\r\nan application made to the head for the cure of _Tinea_, which consisted\r\nof Pomatum rubbed up with a few grains of this salt. Its internal\r\nexhibition should be accompanied with mucilaginous drinks; when an\r\noverdose has been taken, the _white_ of egg, diluted with water, is the\r\nbest antidote, for Orfila has found that albumen decomposes it, reducing\r\nit to the state of mild muriate, whilst the compound which it forms with\r\nit is inert. Many examples are recorded of the success of this practice.\r\nIn the Transactions of the King and Queen’s College of Physicians in\r\nIreland, an interesting case of this kind is related by Dr. Lendrick; it\r\nis, however, at the same time but justice to state, that there are\r\ninstances also of the failure of this antidote. In the 41st volume of\r\nthe _London Medical and Physical Journal_, p. 204, the reader will find\r\nthe case of a girl, who was poisoned by a drachm of Sublimate, and who,\r\nnotwithstanding the copious ingestion of albumen, died in ninety hours.\r\nMore recently vegetable gluten, as existing in wheat-flower, is said to\r\nanswer as well as albumen; for the administration of which all that is\r\nrequired is to give wheat-flower and water. Dose, gr. 1/8 to ½, see\r\n_Liquor Hydrargyri Oxymuriatis_, and _Form. 142_. ADULTERATIONS. It\r\nought to be volatilized by heat; it is frequently met with in commerce\r\ncontaminated with muriate of iron, sometimes with arsenic; the presence\r\nof calomel is at once discovered from its insolubility. TESTS OF ITS\r\nPRESENCE. If any powder be suspected to contain this salt, expose it to\r\nheat in a coated tube, as directed in the treatment of arsenic, but\r\nwithout any carbonaceous admixture, when corrosive sublimate, if\r\npresent, will rise and line the interior surface with a shining white\r\ncrust. This crust is then to be dissolved in distilled water, and\r\nassayed by the following tests; 1st, _lime water_ will produce, if the\r\nsuspected solution contains this salt, a precipitate of an orange yellow\r\ncolour. 2d, a single drop of a dilute solution of _sub-carbonate of\r\npotass_ will at first produce a white precipitate, but on a still\r\nfarther addition of the test, an orange-coloured sediment will be\r\nformed. 3rd, _sulphuretted water_ will throw down a dark coloured\r\nprecipitate, which when dried and strongly heated may be volatilized\r\nwithout any alliaceous odour. 4th, _ammonia_ produces a white\r\nprecipitate, which is an insoluble triple salt, composed of muriatic\r\nacid, ammonia, and oxide of mercury, which, on being heated, grows\r\nyellow; it passes afterwards to a red, and gives out ammoniacal gas,\r\nnitrogen, calomel, and metallic mercury. In this operation the oxide is\r\nsupposed to be decomposed by the hydrogen which results from a portion\r\nof the ammonia. 5th, _Nitrate of tin_, according to Dr. Bostock, is\r\ncapable of detecting the three-millionth part of a grain; a single drop\r\nwill occasion an immediate and copious dark-brown precipitate. All the\r\nabove precipitates, if rubbed on a bright plate of copper, will render\r\nits surface very white. Where the salt is mixed with various coloured\r\nliquids, we must proceed as directed under the head of Arsenic. A very\r\ningenious application of galvanic electricity has been also proposed by\r\nMr. Silvester, for the detection of _corrosive sublimate_, which will\r\nexhibit the mercury in a metallic state. A piece of zinc or iron wire\r\nabout three inches in length, is to be twice bent at right angles, so as\r\nto resemble the Greek letter Π, the two legs of this figure should be\r\ndistant about the diameter of a common gold wedding ring from each\r\nother, and the two ends of the bent wire must afterwards be tied to a\r\nring of this description. Let a plate of glass, not less than three\r\ninches square, be laid as nearly horizontal as possible, and on one side\r\ndrop some sulphuric acid, diluted with about six times its weight of\r\nwater, till it spreads to the size of a halfpenny. At a little distance\r\nfrom this, towards the other side, next drop some of the solution\r\nsupposed to contain corrosive sublimate, till the edges of the two\r\nliquids become joined; and let the wire and ring, prepared as above, be\r\nlaid in such a way that the wire may touch the acid, while the gold ring\r\nis in contact with the suspected liquid. If the minutest quantity of\r\ncorrosive sublimate be present, the ring in a few minutes will be\r\ncovered with mercury on the part which touched the fluid. This\r\nexperiment may be beautifully simplified in the following manner; drop a\r\nsmall quantity of solution containing corrosive sublimate on a piece of\r\ngold, and bring into contact a key, or some piece of iron, so as to form\r\na galvanic circuit, when the gold will be immediately whitened. A\r\nsolution of nitrate of silver will, under similar circumstances,\r\noccasion on the gold a white precipitate, but as no amalgamation takes\r\nplace, it is readily wiped off, and cannot possibly occasion any\r\nfallacy.[526]\r\n\r\nCertain metals likewise decompose solutions of this salt, by virtue of\r\nsuperior affinity; in those cases where the precipitating metal is\r\ncapable of forming a direct union with Mercury, we shall find the\r\nprecipitates to consist of an amalgam of the metal employed; where no\r\nsuch combination takes place, the mercury will be frequently seen\r\nstanding on the surface as a metallic dew. This is particularly striking\r\nwhere iron or steel has been employed; these metals are also at the same\r\ntime blackened by it.\r\n\r\nBrugnatelli[527] has proposed the following method of distinguishing\r\n_corrosive sublimate_ from _arsenic_—Take a quantity of fresh wheat\r\nstarch, mix with water, and add a sufficient quantity of _iodine_ to\r\ngive the liquid a blue colour; if _corrosive sublimate_ or _arsenic_ be\r\nadded to this liquor, the colour is alike destroyed and it becomes\r\nreddish, but if the change has been effected by the latter substance, a\r\nfew drops of sulphuric acid will restore the blue colour, but if by the\r\nformer it is not recoverable by such means.[528]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       HYDRARGYRI SUB-MURIAS.

E.\r\n\r\n                         vulgo. _Calomel_.[529]\r\n\r\nThis preparation has been known in pharmacy for upwards of two centuries\r\nunder a variety of fanciful names, such as _Draco mitigatus_; _Aquila\r\nalba_; _Aquila mitigata_; _Manna metallorum_; _Panchymagogum minerale_;\r\n_Panchymagogus quercetanus_; _Sublimatum dulce_; _Mercurius dulcis\r\nsublimatus_; _Calomelas_; and yet there is not a name in this list that\r\nis so objectionable as the one at present adopted by our colleges: for\r\nwhether we adhere to the theory of muriatic acid being the _simple_\r\nbody, or accede to the new views of _chlorine_, the name is equally\r\ninappropriate; if we regard it as a compound of muriatic acid and oxyd\r\nof mercury, it is not a _sub_-muriate, but as much a _muriate_ as the\r\ncorrosive sublimate; the only difference depending upon the degree of\r\noxidizement of the mercury, which is at a _minimum_ in calomel, and at a\r\n_maximum_ in sublimate. According to the new views respecting chlorine,\r\ncalomel must consist of one proportional of chlorine with one\r\nproportional of metal, and is therefore a _chloride of mercury_.\r\n(“_Proto-chloruretum Hydrargyri._” Codex Med. Paris.)\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form._ A semi-transparent mass, consisting of short\r\nprismatic crystals;[530] inodorous, insipid, and of an ivory colour,\r\nwhich deepens by exposure to light. SOLUBILITY. It is considered as\r\nbeing insoluble, since according to Rouelle, one part requires 1152 of\r\nwater, at 212° for its solution. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ and\r\n_lime water_ decompose it and turn it black, in consequence of\r\nprecipitating the black oxyd of the metal; it is also decomposed by\r\n_soaps_, _sulphurets of potass and antimony_; and by _iron_, _lead_, and\r\n_copper_; hence it is improper to employ any metallic mortar for\r\ndispensing medicines which contain it. There seems to be reason for\r\nsupposing that this preparation may undergo decomposition _in transitu_,\r\nand that therefore some substances may be _chemically_, and yet not be\r\n_medicinally_ incompatible with it. If calomel be boiled for a few\r\nminutes in distilled water to which alcoholized potass has been added,\r\nit is completely decomposed, a _muriate of potass_ and _black oxyd of\r\nmercury_ being the new products. Calomel is not affected by sulphuric\r\nacid in the cold, but, at a boiling temperature, corrosive sublimate,\r\nand deuto-sulphate of mercury are formed. MEDICINAL USES.[531] This\r\nmercurial preparation is more extensively and more usefully employed\r\nthan almost any other article of the materia medica. It is capable of\r\ncuring syphilis in every form, provided it does not run off by the\r\nbowels; and in obstructions and hepatic affections, it is in\r\nwell-regulated doses a most valuable remedy; in combination, it probably\r\nmerits the appellation of _Dirigens_, more decidedly than any other\r\nremedy with which we are acquainted, for when combined with certain\r\ndiuretics, it is diuretic, (_Form. 103, 104_) and in diaphoretic\r\narrangements, it is diaphoretic: it moreover imparts force to many of\r\nthe mild, and moderates the severity of drastic medicines: whenever we\r\nwish a strong and permanent impression to be made on the alimentary\r\ncanal, and through it on the neighbouring viscera or the system\r\ngenerally, Calomel by universal consent is adopted for such a purpose.\r\n(_Form. 81, 88, 119, 161._) In larger doses it is one of the most\r\nefficient purgatives which we possess, especially when in combination\r\nwith other cathartics: it appears to be particularly eligible in the\r\ndiseases of children; and it is singular that infants can generally bear\r\nlarger doses of it than adults. DOSE, as an alterative, from gr. ss to\r\nj, night and morning; as a purgative, from gr. ij to gr. x, or in some\r\ncases even to gr. xv, or ℈j. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. That of pill; its\r\ninsolubility and specific gravity render any other form ineligible.\r\nOFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Pil. Hydrargyri submuriat. comp:_ L.\r\nIMPURITIES. _Corrosive sublimate_ may be detected by precipitation being\r\nproduced, by the carbonate of potass, in a solution made by boiling the\r\nsuspected sample with a small portion of muriate of ammonia, in\r\ndistilled water; calomel ought also, when rubbed with a fixed alkali, to\r\nbecome intensely black, and not to exhibit any trace of an orange hue.\r\n\r\nHOWARD’S OR JEWEL’S _Hydro-sublimate_. Instead of subliming so as to\r\nobtain the calomel in a concrete state, as directed by the Pharmacopœia,\r\nthe salt in the act of sublimation is exposed to aqueous vapour, and\r\nreceived in water. Being in a state of very minute division, it is\r\nlighter than common calomel in the proportion of three to five, and it\r\ncannot contain any corrosive sublimate. The French in their late _codex_\r\nhave introduced a similar formula, under the title of “Murias Mercurii\r\ndulcis mediante aqua subtilissime divisus, _juxta Methodum Josiæ\r\nJewel_.”\r\n\r\nThis _Patent Calomel_ of Howard is undoubtedly to be preferred, and\r\nappears, in consequence probably of its minute division, to affect the\r\nsystem more readily than that made according to the Pharmacopœias.\r\n\r\nSUB-MURIAS HYDRARGYRI PRÆCIPITATUS. E.D. This is produced by\r\nprecipitating a nitrate of mercury by muriate of soda; the preparation\r\nwill generally contain a small portion of _sub-nitrate_, and it is on\r\nthat account more liable to run off by the bowels in small doses: in\r\nother respects it is essentially the same as that procured by\r\nsublimation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    HYDRARGYRI SULPHURETUM RUBRUM.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a _bi-sulphuret of Mercury_, i. e.\r\nit consists of two proportionals of sulphur and one of mercury.\r\nUSES.[533] It is now only used for the purpose of mercurial fumigation,\r\nwhich is done by inhaling the fumes, produced by throwing ʒss of it on\r\nred hot iron; the effect which is generally produced is violent\r\nsalivation; this however does not depend upon the action of the\r\nsubstance as a _sulphuret_, but upon its decomposition, and the\r\nvolatilization of the metallic mercury with a portion of sulphate and\r\nsulphureous vapour. Mr. Pearson observes that it is useful in those\r\ncases of venereal ulcers in the mouth, throat, and nose, where it is an\r\nobject to put a _sudden_ stop to the progress of the disease, but that\r\nmercury must at the same time be introduced into the constitution, by\r\ninunction, just as much as if no fumigations had been made use of.\r\nUlcers and excrescencies about the pudendum and anus in women are\r\nparticularly benefitted by it; and in these cases it is conveniently\r\napplied by placing a red hot heater at the bottom of a night-stool pan,\r\nand after sprinkling on it a few grains of the sulphuret, placing the\r\npatient upon the stool. ADULTERATIONS. _Red Lead_[534] may be discovered\r\nby digesting it in acetic acid, and by adding sulphuret of ammonia,\r\nwhich will produce a black precipitate; or by burning a small portion of\r\nthe suspected sample on a piece of bread in the candle, when metallic\r\nglobules will announce its presence; for the oxide of mercury, although\r\nrevived by this process, will at the same time be volatilized. The\r\nbread, by combustion, affords the carbon by which the metallic reduction\r\nis effected. _Dragon’s Blood_, by its giving a colour to alcohol when\r\ndigested with it; _Chalk_, by its effervescence, on the addition of an\r\nacid. It is known in the arts under the name of _Vermillion_; and by the\r\nfollowing simple expedient its presence may, in very minute quantities,\r\nbe easily recognised; boil a portion with sulphuric acid in a platina\r\nspoon, and lay the sulphate thus produced, in a drop of muriatic acid,\r\non a piece of gold, and bring a piece of metallic tin in contact with\r\nboth, when the white mercurial stain will be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n HYDRARGYRI SULPHURETUM NIGRUM.

It is supposed to be alterative, and has been\r\ngiven for such a purpose, in doses from gr. v. to ʒss, but its medicinal\r\nvirtues are very questionable. ADULTERATIONS. It is frequently\r\nimperfect, globules of mercury being still discoverable in it by a\r\nmagnifying glass, or by its communicating a whiteness to a portion of\r\ngold upon which it is rubbed; _ivory black_ may be discovered by the\r\nresidue, after throwing a suspected sample on a red hot iron; it is also\r\nsometimes mixed with equal parts of crude antimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   HYOSCYAMI FOLIA ET SEMINA.

Resin, mucilage, extractive matter, gallic acid, and some\r\nsalts; an alkaline element (_Hyoscyama_) is said to constitute its\r\nactive principle. This principle differs from other vegetable alkalies,\r\nin being able to resist a low red heat, without undergoing\r\ndecomposition. SOLUBILITY. Water freely extracts the narcotic powers of\r\nthis plant, and decoction destroys them; diluted alcohol is the best\r\nmenstruum. INCOMPATIBLES.

In selecting and conducting the operation, the following\r\ngeneral rules should be observed.\r\n\r\n  I. _Infusion should always be preferred to decoction, where the\r\n      medicinal virtues of the vegetable substance reside in volatile\r\n      oil, or in principles which are easily soluble; whereas, if they\r\n      depend upon resino-mucilaginous particles, decoction is an\r\n      indispensable operation._\r\n\r\n  II. _The temperature employed must be varied according to the\r\n      circumstances of each case;[537] an infusion made in the cold, is\r\n      in general more grateful, but less active, than one made with\r\n      heat._\r\n\r\n  III. _The duration of the process must likewise be regulated by the\r\n      nature of the substances, or the intention of the prescriber; for\r\n      the infusion will differ according to the time in which the water\r\n      has been digested on the materials; thus, the aroma of the plant\r\n      is first taken up, then, in succession, the colouring, astringent,\r\n      and gummy parts._\r\n\r\nInfusions are liable to undergo decompositions by being kept, and\r\ntherefore, like decoctions, they must be regarded as _extemporaneous_\r\npreparations. Unless the dose of them be otherwise stated, it is\r\ngenerally from f℥j to f℥ij.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. _Simple Infusions._\r\n\r\nINFUSUM ANTHEMIDIS. L.E. It is a good stomachic; and when exhibited\r\nwarm, is well calculated to assist the operation of emetics: (_Form.\r\n66_): the cold infusion, i. e. made with cold water, is more grateful.\r\n_Incompatibles._ All _soluble preparations of iron_; _nitrate of\r\nsilver_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_; _acetate_, and _sub-acetate of lead_;\r\n_solutions of isinglass_; _infusion of yellow cinchona bark_. Dose,\r\nf℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM CALUMBÆ. L.E. See Calumbæ Radix. This infusion is more\r\nperishable than that of other bitters; in twenty-four hours a copious\r\nprecipitation takes place in it, and in two days it becomes ropy, and\r\neven musty. _Form. 155._ Dose, f℥i-f℥ij.\r\n\r\n_Infusum Caryophyllorum._ L. f℥j. of this infusion holds in solution the\r\nactive matter of grs. vj of cloves. _Incompatibles._ Precipitates are\r\nproduced by _sulphate of iron_; _sulphate of zinc_; _acetate of lead_;\r\n_nitrate of silver_; _tartarized antimony_; _lime water_, and _yellow\r\ncinchona_. Dose, f℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM CASCARILLÆ. L. It is incompatible with the substances mentioned\r\nunder _Infus. Caryophyll: Form. 33._ Dose, f℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM CINCHONÆ. L.E.D. We obtain in this preparation a feeble solution\r\nof the active constituents of bark, which will agree with many stomachs\r\nthat are rebellious to the stronger preparations. Dose, f℥i-f℥iij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM CUSPARIÆ. L. This is a judicious form of the bark, possessing\r\nits stimulant and tonic properties. Dose, f℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM DIGITALIS. L.E. This is the best form in which we can administer\r\nthe _foxglove_, where our wish is to obtain its diuretic effects as\r\nspeedily as possible. (_Form. 110._) Dose, fʒij to f℥ss, twice a day,\r\n_see Digitalis_. _Incompatibles._ We shall counteract its effects by\r\nendeavouring to obviate its nauseating tendency by _brandy and water_,\r\n&c. Precipitates are produced by _sulphate of iron_, and the _infusion\r\nof yellow cinchona_, &c.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM LINI COMPOSITUM. L.E. A cheap and useful demulcent; alcohol and\r\npreparations of _lead_, are of course incompatible with it; the\r\n_tinctura ferri muriatis_ produces a flocculent precipitate.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM QUASSIÆ. L.E. The proportion of Quassia directed for half a pint\r\nof water, is that of ℈j by the London, and ʒss by the Edinburgh College;\r\nthe former is much too small, for, in order to obtain a saturated\r\ninfusion, ʒij are required for that quantity of water. _Incompatibles._\r\n_The salts of iron_ produce no change in it; nor is it affected by any\r\nof those substances with which it is likely to come in contact in a\r\nmedical prescription. It is highly useful in debilities of the stomach\r\nand intestinal canal, and in irregular and atonic gout, and it has been\r\nobserved, that in hysterical atony, to which the female sex is so prone,\r\nthe Quassia affords more vigour and relief to the system, than the\r\nPeruvian Bark, especially when combined with a small portion of sulphate\r\nof zinc. To this, as well as the other stomachic infusions, it is usual\r\nto add at the time of prescribing them a small quantity of aromatic\r\ntincture or spirit. _Form. 35; 144._ Dose, f℥ss-f℥iss.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM RHEI. L.E. The Edinburgh infusion is stronger than that of\r\nLondon, and is rendered more grateful by the addition of spirit of\r\ncinnamon; these infusions, however, when given without any _adjuvants_,\r\nproduce but a feeble effect. This is obvious, since ℈j of rhubarb in\r\nsubstance, is at least equivalent in its effects to ʒiss when in\r\ninfusion. _Incompatibles._ The _stronger acids_; _the sulphates of iron\r\nand zinc_; _nitrate of silver_; _tartarized antimony_; _acetate of\r\nlead_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_, and the infusions of _cusparia_,\r\n_cinchona_, _catechu_, _galls_, and some other _astringent_ vegetables;\r\nthe _alkalies_ deepen the colour, but produce no decomposition. Dose,\r\nf℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM SIMAROUBÆ. L. This infusion is inodorous, of a clear straw\r\ncolour, with a slightly bitter taste. It presents the best mode of\r\nexhibiting _Simarouba bark_. Dose, f℥ij, beyond this it will prove\r\nemetic. _Incompatibles._ _Alkaline carbonates_ and _lime water_ render\r\nit milky; and it is precipitated by the following substances; _infusions\r\nof catechu_; _galls_, and _yellow cinchona_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_;\r\n_nitrate of silver_, and _acetate of lead_. See _Simaroubæ Cortex_.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM TABACI. L. It is never used but as an enema, in incarcerated\r\nhernia, and in ileus. See _Tabaci Folia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        2. _Compound Infusions._\r\n\r\nINFUSUM ARMORACIÆ COMPOSITUM. L. In this preparation the stimulant\r\nproperty of the horse-radish is materially aided by the mustard; pure\r\nalkalies, but not their carbonates, may form extemporaneous additions;\r\nfor the other incompatibles, see _Armoraciæ Radix_. Dose, f℥iss. _Form.\r\n45._\r\n\r\nINFUSUM AURANTII COMPOSITUM. L. A grateful stomachic, having the\r\nagreeable compound taste of its several ingredients; it has the merit of\r\nsitting easily on the stomach. Dose, f℥j-f℥iss.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM CATECHU COMPOSITUM. L.E. This infusion is a powerful astringent,\r\nrendered grateful by the addition of cinnamon; it will keep for several\r\nmonths, provided the directions of the Edinburgh College be not followed\r\nin adding the syrup. In prescribing it, we must remember that it\r\ncontains a large proportion of _tannin_. See _Catechu_. Dose, f℥j-f℥iij.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM GENTIANÆ COMPOSITUM. L. An elegant tonic and stomachic infusion.\r\nIt affords a good example of the virtues of a natural substance being\r\nenhanced by the additions of art, as discussed at page 164, for the\r\nbitterness of the gentian is here subdued by the aromatic quality of the\r\nlemon and orange peel. _Incompatibles._ _Acetate of lead_ throws down a\r\ncopious precipitate from the infusion, and _sulphate of iron_ strikes a\r\nbrown colour, but no precipitate takes place for several hours.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM ROSÆ COMPOSITUM. L.E.D. This is an infusion of the petals of the\r\nred rose, rendered astringent and refrigerant,[538] by the addition of\r\ndilute sulphuric acid. By referring to the DYNAMETER, it will be seen\r\nthat f℥j; does not contain more than four and a half minims of _dilute_\r\nacid, which are equivalent to three-sevenths of a minim of the strong\r\n_concentrated_ acid. Wherever therefore we expect any advantage from\r\nthis latter ingredient, the quantity must be increased by extemporaneous\r\naddition. _Incompatibles._ All those bodies which are decomposed by the\r\nsulphuric acid; the _sulphates of iron_ and _zinc_ do not immediately\r\nalter the infusion, but they _slowly_ decompose it, producing\r\nprecipitates of a dark colour. Dr. Clarke of Cambridge detected _iron_\r\nin the petals;[539] may not the presence of this metal enhance the tonic\r\npowers of the infusion? It affords a most elegant vehicle for the\r\nexhibition of cathartic salts.\r\n\r\nINFUSUM SENNÆ COMPOSITUM. L.E.D. A pint of water will take up the active\r\nmatter of ℥j of senna, but nothing beyond that proportion; hence there\r\nis an unnecessary waste in the London process. The quantity of infusion\r\ndirected to be made at one time, is also injudicious, since by simple\r\nexposure to the air for only a few hours, in consequence of the powerful\r\naffinity of its extractive matter for oxygen, a yellow precipitate takes\r\nplace, and the infusion loses its purgative quality, and excites\r\n_tormina_ in the bowels; in preparing it therefore, we see the necessity\r\nof conducting the process in _covered_ vessels, and of making only such\r\na portion as may be required for immediate use; indeed, notwithstanding\r\nevery precaution, the extractive will to a certain extent become\r\noxidized, and the infusion have a tendency to gripe.[540] Dr. Cullen\r\nused to say that Senna was one of the best purgatives, if it could only\r\nbe divested of its griping quality; this however he was unable to\r\nobviate, because he was not aware of its cause, and therefore conjoined\r\nit with various aromatics, instead of those salts[541] which might be\r\ncapable of increasing the solubility of its oxidized extractive, or the\r\npurgative activity of the infusion; see page 150, and 161. _Soluble\r\ntartar_ and _alkaline salts_ are its most useful adjuncts; it is however\r\nrarely prescribed in practice without the addition of other cathartics.\r\n(_Form. 70, 76, 90._) Sydenham’s favourite “_potio cathartica\r\nlenitiva_,” consisted of an infusion of tamarinds, senna leaves, and\r\nrhubarb, with the addition of manna and syrup of roses. The addition of\r\ntamarinds renders the infusion more grateful but less active; when made\r\nwith _bohea tea_, it is in a great degree deprived of its nauseous\r\ntaste; a decoction of guaiacum increases its powers, and is said at the\r\nsame time to render it milder. Bitters also very considerably exalt its\r\nefficacy, see page 153. A pint of the infusion with a drachm of jalap\r\nforms an excellent combination for a purgative enema. _Incompatibles._\r\nThe infusion is disturbed by _strong acids_; _lime water_; _nitrate of\r\nsilver_; _oxy-muriate of mercury_; _acetate of lead_; _tartarized\r\nantimony_; and by an _infusion of yellow cinchona_. DOSE, f℥j-f℥ij.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IPECACUANHÆ RADIX. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n             (Callicocca[542] Ipecacuanha.) _Ipecacuanha._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, tortuous pieces of the thickness of a goose-quill,\r\nsurrounded by numerous prominent rings, separated by deep grooves. This\r\nroot, when powdered, has a faint disagreeable _odour_, and a bitter\r\nsub-acrid _taste_. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The late researches of M. M.\r\nMajendie and Pelletier have detected the existence of a new vegetable\r\nproximate principle in this root, to which ipecacuan is indebted for its\r\nemetic properties; they have, accordingly, denominated it\r\n_Emetine_.[543] It assumes the form of transparent brownish red scales,\r\nwhich are nearly inodorous, but have a slightly bitter, acrid, but not\r\nnauseous taste. _Emetine_ is decomposed by a heat higher than that of\r\nboiling water; it is insoluble in water, in every proportion, without\r\nundergoing the least change; and in a moist atmosphere it deliquesces;\r\nit is also soluble in alcohol, but not in æther; _nitric acid_ dissolves\r\nit, but at the same time decomposes it; _dilute sulphuric acid_ has no\r\naction on it; _muriatic acid_ and _phosphoric acid_ dissolve it, without\r\naltering its nature; _acetic acid_ dissolves it with great facility;\r\n_corrosive sublimate_ precipitates it from its solutions, but\r\n_tartarized antimony_ has no effect upon them; _gallic acid_, the\r\n_infusion of galls_, and _acetate of lead_, precipitate it. A grain\r\nexcites violent vomiting, followed by sleep, and the patient awakes in\r\nperfect health! It exerts also a specific action on the lungs and mucous\r\nmembrane of the intestinal canal; when taken in an overdose, its action\r\ncan be instantly paralysed by a decoction of galls. There seems to be no\r\ngreat advantage in substituting this body for the ordinary powder of\r\nIpecacuanha, except perhaps that its taste being much less offensive, it\r\nmay very easily be given to children.[544] _Emetine_ appears to exist in\r\nIpecacuanha, combined in the following manner, _emetine_ 16, oils 2, wax\r\n6, gum 10, starch 40, woody fibre 20.\r\n\r\nSince the discovery of _Emetine_, whose properties are described above,\r\nPelletier has extended his researches into its composition and nature;\r\nand he has lately been enabled to state that this body, which in\r\nconjunction with Majendie, he had formerly announced as “a new vegetable\r\nproximate principle,” turns out to be a compound of a peculiar alkaline\r\nbasis, which may be called _Emeta_, and some acid, together with an\r\nadmixture of colouring matter; when compared with _Emetine_, it is what\r\nwhite crystallized sugar is to moist sugar. Its ultimate elements are\r\noxygen, hydrogen and carbon; it is a white and friable substance, and\r\nunlike Emetin, is not altered by exposure to air; it is slightly bitter,\r\nand very sparingly soluble in water; with the mineral acids it forms\r\nsalts, from whose solutions the infusion of galls throws down white and\r\nflocculent precipitates; the alcoholic solution of _Emeta_ acts upon\r\nvegetable colour as an alkali.\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL USES OF IPECACUAN. It is unquestionably the most valuable of\r\nthe vegetable emetics, and in cases where the stomach is irritable it is\r\nto be preferred to Tartarized Antimony, and it is also less liable to\r\nact upon the bowels. In the form of decoction (made by boiling three\r\ndrachms of the bruised root in a quart of water down to a pint) it has\r\nbeen found serviceable as an enema in Dysentery, and internal piles.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. All vegetable astringents, as _infusion of\r\ngalls_, &c. _vegetable acids_, especially the _acetic_, weaken its\r\npower; Dr. Irvine found that grs. xxx, administered in f℥ij of vinegar,\r\nproduced only some loose stools. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. The form of powder\r\nis most energetic, although the vinous solution is both active and\r\nconvenient. DOSE. The medicinal operation of this substance varies with\r\nits dose, thus grs. x to ʒss act as an emetic; (_Form: 65_,) grs. j to\r\nij, as an expectorant, (_Form: 134, 138_,)and in still smaller doses it\r\nproves stomachic and diaphoretic; by combination with opium, this latter\r\nquality becomes more powerful, (_Form: 28, 130_.) The primary effect of\r\nthis medicine is that of stimulating the stomach, and it is equally\r\nobvious that its secondary ones depend on the numerous sympathies of\r\nother parts with the organs of digestion. The action of this remedy upon\r\nthe pulmonary organs is extremely interesting; it would seem that in\r\ncertain conditions of these organs, attended with a dry, hard cough, it\r\npromotes expectoration, while in affections attended with an inordinate\r\nsecretion of mucus, it as certainly represses it, and acts the part of\r\nan astringent. In dysentery, and chronic diarrhœa, its astringent power\r\nis also very decided. _Form: 58_. When combined with cathartics it aids\r\nand accelerates their operation; _Form: 84_. In Hemorrhage from the\r\nlungs and uterus, it is decidedly useful, when administered in such\r\ndoses as to excite a slight degree of nausea, by which the force of the\r\ncirculation is controlled; I have usually combined it, for such a\r\npurpose, with the Acetate of lead in Hæmopthysis; and Bergius relates a\r\ncase of violent uterine hæmorrhage which was successfully treated by\r\ngiving half a grain every half hour. In certain forms of Dyspepsia it\r\nproves highly beneficial, when administered as proposed by Daubenton, in\r\ndoses just sufficient to excite a slight sensation of vermicular motion\r\nof the stomach, without carrying it to the point of nausea, which may be\r\ngenerally effected by half a grain three times a day. Its peculiar\r\nnauseous taste is completely covered by the addition of powdered Gum\r\nArabic. SOLUBILITY. Alcohol takes up four parts in twenty of Ipecacuan;\r\nproof spirit six and a half; and boiling water rather more than eight\r\nparts; one pint of good sherry wine will dissolve about 100 grains; the\r\nalcoholic is more emetic than the aqueous solution; decoction destroys\r\nthe emetic property of the root. OFFICINAL PREP. _Pulvis Ipecacuanhæ\r\ncomp:_ L.E.D. _Vinum Ipecac_. L.E.D.[545] The powder is liable to become\r\ninert by exposure to air and light. The root is refractory, and is\r\nreduced to powder with difficulty, unless a few drops of oil, or an\r\nalmond or two, be previously added. It is a curious fact that the\r\neffluvia of this root occasion in some persons the most distressing\r\nsensations of suffocation. I am acquainted with a lady, who is\r\nconstantly seized with a violent dyspnœa, whenever the powder of\r\nIpecacuan is brought into her presence. ADULTERATIONS. There are several\r\nvarieties of Ipecacuan to be found in the market, which it is important\r\nto distinguish; _viz._ 1, _The brown variety_, which is the best,\r\ncontaining sixteen per cent. of emetin; 2, the _grey variety_, with\r\nfourteen per cent. of emetin; 3, the _white variety_, with only five of\r\nemetin. The two former varieties are those usually met with, being\r\nimported into this country in bales from Rio Janeiro; the brown is\r\ndistinguished from the grey, in being more wrinkled; the white variety\r\nhas no wrinkles whatever. We are informed by Decandolle that the genuine\r\nroot is frequently mixed with those of _violets_, _Apocynæ_,\r\n_Euphorbia_, &c. It is also sometimes mixed with the roots of several\r\nspecies of _Ionidum_.\r\n\r\n\r\n               JALAPÆ RADIX. L.E.D. (Convolvulus Jalapa.)\r\n\r\n                                _Jalap._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This root is pulverulent, furnishing a powder of a pale\r\nbrownish yellow colour. _Odour_, peculiar; _Taste_, sweetish and\r\nslightly pungent. _Chemical Composition._ Resin, gum, extractive,\r\nfecula, lignin, and some salts. The combination of the three first\r\nprinciples appears requisite for the production of its _full_ cathartic\r\neffect. The gum has been supposed to possess diuretic properties. Very\r\nlately a saline principle has been obtained from Jalap by Mr. Hume,\r\njun.: but I am not aware that its medicinal properties have been\r\nascertained. It is procured by macerating the powdered root for twelve\r\nor fourteen days in acetic acid, by which a solution is obtained, which\r\nmust be filtered, and then saturated with ammonia; the mixture is to be\r\nshaken violently, when a _sabulous_ deposit will take place, and a few\r\ncrystals be collected on the sides of the vessel; both of these must be\r\ncollected, and washed in distilled water; and then redissolved in\r\nconcentrated acetic acid, and reprecipitated by ammonia added in excess.\r\nBy which means, small white acicular crystals are thrown down, to which\r\nthe name of _Jalapine_ has been given. SOLUBILITY. Proof spirit is its\r\nappropriate menstruum. MED. USES. It is a cathartic of a stimulating\r\ndescription, acting principally upon the colon, and, notwithstanding the\r\ntormina it may sometimes induce, it is no less safe than efficacious; as\r\na hydragogue purgative it has been greatly extolled, but for such a\r\npurpose it will answer better in combination, as in _Form. 73_. Its\r\naction is said to be promoted by the addition of Ipecacuan, or\r\ntartarized antimony. (_Form. 84._) In dropsy its union with\r\nsuper-tartrate of potass is calculated to promote its beneficial\r\noperation. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. That of powder is the most eligible,\r\nespecially when combined with some other powdered substance:\r\npulverization increases its activity, see _Pulveres_. Van Swieten\r\nadvised it to be pulverised, and mixed with sugar, and a small quantity\r\nof some aromatic. The addition of Soap is supposed to render its\r\noperation much milder, and the Prussian Pharmacopœia contains a formula\r\nfor such a combination, which is said to operate mildly and promptly. To\r\nthis preparation the name SAPO JALAPINUS[546] is given. DOSE, grs. x to\r\nʒss. OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Pulv. Jalap. comp._ E. _Extract._ _Jalap_.\r\nL.E.D. _Tinct. Jalap_. L.E.D. _Tinct.

D.)\r\n\r\nThere is very considerable obscurity with regard to the history and\r\nchemical constitution of this substance; three varieties of it are met\r\nwith in the shops, viz. 1. _African Kino_, which bears the highest\r\nprice, and has all the appearance of a natural production, slender twigs\r\nbeing often intermixed in its substance; it is of a reddish brown\r\ncolour, and has a bitterish astringent taste. 2. _Botany Bay Kino_, has\r\nalso the aspect of a natural production, it is in more solid masses than\r\nthe former species, is less brittle (for it contains a very small\r\nproportion of resin) and, with its astringency, has a disagreeable\r\nsweetish taste. 3. _Jamaica Kino_, this is the one most commonly met\r\nwith; it has the appearance of a dry extract, is in small fragments, of\r\na colour more nearly approaching to black than that of the others, and\r\nhas an astringent and slightly bitter taste. There is also a fourth\r\nvariety mentioned, viz. the _East India_ or _Amboyna_, but this does not\r\nappear to differ from the African variety. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. In all\r\nthe varieties the predominant principles are tannin and extractive.\r\nSOLUBILITY. The best menstruum is diluted alcohol. _Incompatible\r\nSubstances_, vide _Gallæ_. Mr. Thomson also states a fact which I have\r\nreason to consider quite correct, that the alkalies destroy the\r\nastringent properties of kino. All the varieties are soluble in\r\nsolutions of pure potass and ammonia, and no precipitation takes place\r\non the addition of water. MEDICINAL USES. It is principally employed as\r\nan astringent, but from its liability to vary in strength, it has been\r\nvery generally superseded by Catechu.[548] FORMS OF EXHIBITION.

Its extract, which was some years ago imported into this\r\ncountry, is supposed to have been employed for giving astringency to\r\nPort wine.

It may be used either in decoction, or\r\ntincture, the latter of which may be made by dissolving two ounces of\r\nthe root in a pint of proof spirit. In all its forms it is eminently\r\nastringent. I have used it with much success in Leucorrhæa, and in\r\nuterine hemorrhages. The extract may be distinguished from Kino, to\r\nwhich it bears a great resemblance in appearance and taste, by being\r\nvery fusible by heat, whereas Kino does not possess that character.\r\n\r\n\r\n             LICHEN. L.E.D. (Lichen Islandicus.) _Lichen._\r\n\r\n                  _Iceland Liverwort._ _Iceland Moss._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, none; _Taste_, mucilaginous and bitter. SOLUBILITY.\r\nThe effect of water upon this vegetable substance is materially modified\r\nby temperature; if cold, the lichen absorbs nearly its own weight by\r\nmaceration, but gives out to the menstruum little or none of its\r\nvirtues; if the water be warm, it soon acquires a bitter impregnation;\r\nby ebullition, a decoction is obtained, which, as it cools, gelatinizes.\r\nSee _Decoct. Lichen_. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Proust has shewn by analysis\r\nthat 100 parts of this moss contain 64 parts of a substance bearing some\r\nanalogy to vegetable gluten, 33 of matter, soluble in hot water, and\r\nresembling starch, and 3 parts of a bitter principle. MEDICINAL USES.\r\nThis vegetable was introduced to the notice of the profession by\r\nLinnæus, who recommended its decoction, as having been administered with\r\ngreat success for coughs in Sweden. Upon its introduction into this\r\ncountry, its patrons bestowed so many extravagant eulogiums upon its\r\npowers, that the less sanguine practitioner at once abandoned its use in\r\ndisgust, and it fell into unmerited disrepute. It would be idle to speak\r\nof its specific effects in phthisis; but, as a demulcent, it is\r\ncertainly very superior to the mucilaginous mixtures in ordinary use,\r\nand its simple bitter principle at the same time tends to produce a\r\ntonic effect, which is frequently desirable in the debilitated condition\r\nwhich characterizes the latter stages of this disease. There are\r\ncircumstances, however, which may render the removal of the bitter\r\nadvantageous; in which case, maceration in successive waters, or in a\r\nweak alkaline ley, as recommended by Westring, will be found to answer\r\nthe intended purpose. OFFICINAL PREPARATION. _Decoct. Lichen. Island._\r\nE. D. Sir Alexander Crichton has offered some observations upon the\r\ngenuineness of this article which deserve attention. He says that there\r\nare two varieties in the market; the best of which has a horny texture,\r\nand yields a bitter mucilage. It is that which comes from Iceland,\r\nNorway, Sweden, and Finland. The inferior kind has a membranous texture,\r\nand yields little bitter or mucilage in comparison with the former.\r\nWhere it comes from he knows not, but he suspects it to be British, as\r\nit is much cheaper than the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n               LIMONES. L.E.D. (Citrus Medica. _Baccæ._)\r\n\r\n                               _Lemons._\r\n\r\nSUCCUS—THE JUICE consists of _Citric acid_, mucilage, extractive matter,\r\nand small portions of sugar and water. _Specific gravity_, 1·0384. It\r\nmay be preserved for a considerable length of time, by covering its\r\nsurface with fixed oil.\r\n\r\nIts use in making saline draughts has been already noticed, see\r\n_Acid. Citric._ Its principal medicinal value consists in its\r\nantiscorbutic[549] virtues; indeed it may be fairly asserted that\r\nthis disease, so peculiarly incident to a sea life, has been nearly\r\neradicated by the juice of lemons. Sir Gilbert Blane, in speaking of\r\nits efficacy, asserts that “those only who have made themselves\r\nacquainted with the early part of the Naval history of this country,\r\nor those who have perused the interesting, popular, and eloquent\r\nnarrative of Commodore Anson’s voyage, can duly appreciate the value\r\nof this simple remedy.” Lemonade, as a beverage in putrid diseases,\r\nwas first introduced by the French physicians in the beginning of\r\nthe 17th century, and about the year 1660, an Italian from Florence,\r\nhaving learnt a process of freezing confectionary, conceived the\r\nhappy idea of converting such beverage into ice. This found a ready\r\nsale, and was the occasion of so great an increase in the number of\r\nsellers of Lemonade, that in the year 1676, the _Lemonadiers_ of\r\nParis were formed into a company, and received a patent from the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nCORTEX—THE RIND OR PEEL is composed of two distinct parts; the exterior,\r\nwhich contains glands, filled with a fragrant volatile oil, upon which\r\nall its properties depend, and the _interior coat_, which is tasteless\r\nand indigestible. The flavour may be obtained by rubbing lump sugar upon\r\nit, which will imbibe the oil, and if it be then dried by a very gentle\r\nheat, may be preserved unimpaired for any length of time, and will be\r\npreferable to the volatile oil obtained by distillation, for the fire\r\ngenerally imparts an unpleasant or empyreumatic flavour.[550]\r\n\r\nIt has been already stated, that “the different parts of the same plant\r\nhave frequently very different properties.” The Lemon offers a good\r\nexample of this fact, for its juice is _acid_, its seeds _bitter_, and\r\nits peel _aromatic_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     LINIMENTA. L.E.D. _Liniments._\r\n\r\nThese are external applications, having the consistence of oil or\r\nbalsam. If we except the _Liniment.

It is much less stimulating than\r\nthe preceding one.\r\n\r\nLINIMENTUM CALCIS. E.D. _Oil and lime water, equal parts._ This is an\r\n_earthy_ soap, formed by the combination of lime and oil; the soapy\r\nmatter separates on standing, it should therefore be _extemporaneous_.\r\nIn cases of burns and scalds where the cuticle has been destroyed, it is\r\nan advantageous application.\r\n\r\nLINIMENTUM CAMPHORÆ. L. _Oleum Camphoratum._ E.D. Camphor one, olive oil\r\nfour parts. It is a simple solution of camphor in fixed oil, and forms a\r\nvery useful embrocation to sprains, bruises, glandular swellings, and in\r\nrheumatic affections.\r\n\r\nLINIMENTUM CAMPHORÆ COMPOSITUM. L. _Camphor two, liquor ammoniæ six,\r\nspirits of lavender sixteen parts._ It is highly stimulating.[551]\r\n\r\nLINIMENTUM HYDRARGYRI. L. A pound of this liniment contains nearly ℥iv\r\nof mercury; it affects the mouth more rapidly than strong mercurial\r\nointment, although it will be seen by the _Medicinal Dynameter_ to\r\ncontain less Mercury. This effect is to be attributed to the stimulating\r\nproperties of its adjuncts, viz. Camphor and Ammonia.\r\n\r\nLINIMENTUM SAPONIS COMPOSITUM. L. _Hard soap_ iij, _camphor_ j, _spirit\r\nof rosemary_ xvj parts. It is a stimulant and anodyne application, and\r\nin local pains opium may be advantageously added to it.

The presence\r\nof other salts in the solution may be discovered by saturating a portion\r\nwith pure nitric acid, and applying the test for sulphuric acid,\r\n(_Barytes_) and that for muriatic acid, (_Nitrate of Silver._) Carbonic\r\nacid is detected by its effervescing with acids, or by its forming with\r\nlime water, a precipitate, soluble with effervescence in nitric acid; it\r\nought to be free from all fetor; its strength can only be determined by\r\ntaking its specific gravity. It should be preserved in well closed\r\nbottles, and their dimensions should be small, for when in large vessels\r\nit often becomes carbonated before it is half used.\r\n\r\n\r\n        LIQUOR AMMONIÆ ACETATIS. L. AQUA ACETATIS AMMONIÆ. E.D.\r\n\r\n                    Solution of Acetate of Ammonia.\r\n\r\n                     olim, _Spirit of Mindererus_.\r\n\r\nThis preparation is a solution of the neutral _acetate of ammonia_, with\r\na proportion of carbonic acid diffused through it; it is made by\r\nsaturating the sub-carbonate of ammonia with distilled vinegar, for\r\nwhich purpose it will generally be found that ℥j of the alkali will\r\nsaturate oiss of the vinegar; since, however, the quantity of acid in\r\ndistilled vinegar as well the strength of the ammonia, are liable to\r\nconstant variation, the exact point of neutralization should be\r\nascertained by the alternate application of litmus and turmeric papers;\r\nfor if the proportions be not accurately adjusted, some of the metallic\r\nsalts, especially those of _antimony_, which are often prescribed in\r\nconjunction with it, are decomposed, and thus rendered inefficacious;\r\nand on this account an excess of alkali is to be feared more than that\r\nof acid. This preparation is also not unfrequently employed as a\r\ncollyrium, when much serious mischief may arise from the carbonate of\r\nammonia predominating. It has been already stated that a very minute\r\nproportion of extractive matter is rendered sensible on the addition of\r\nan alkali; hence this preparation frequently derives from the vinegar a\r\nbrown hue, which may be removed by filtering the solution through a\r\nlittle well burnt charcoal. It also deserves notice that the presence of\r\na trace of copper, derived from the copper cocks through which the\r\nvinegar has passed, will impart a _brown_ tinge, whilst in larger\r\nquantities this metal yields a _blue_ colour with ammonia. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. _Acids_; _fixed alkalies_; _alum_; _lime water_; _sulphate\r\nof magnesia_; _corrosive sublimate_; _nitrate of silver_; and the\r\n_sulphates of zinc, copper, and iron_. _Acetate of lead_ produces also a\r\ncopious precipitation, but this depends upon the presence of the\r\ncarbonic acid diffused through the solution, which decomposes the salt\r\nand forms an insoluble carbonate of lead. _Magnesia_ likewise, contrary\r\nto what might be supposed, decomposes the solution and renders it\r\npungent, from the extrication of ammoniacal gas; this phenomenon depends\r\nupon the magnesia forming a triple acetate with one part of the ammonia,\r\nand setting the remainder at liberty. MED. USES. When assisted by warmth\r\nand plentiful dilution, it is an excellent diaphoretic, and produces its\r\neffects without quickening the circulation: (_Form: 117, 126_,) by\r\nkeeping the surface of the body cool, its action is determined to the\r\nkidneys, and it proves diuretic, especially when combined with remedies\r\nof a similar tendency. (_Form: 111._) DOSE, fʒiv to fʒxij. Externally it\r\nfurnishes a lotion, valuable as a refrigerant, especially when combined\r\nwith some spirituous preparation.

There is frequently a deficient quantity of the\r\nsub-carbonate in solution, its pungency being kept up by the addition of\r\n_liquor ammoniæ_; this may be discovered by shaking it with twice its\r\nbulk of alcohol, when a coagulum of considerable density should occur,\r\nthe absence of which will denote the sophistication of the article. Its\r\n_specific gravity_ should be 1·150. The _Incompatibles_ are those\r\nenumerated under the history of _Ammoniæ Sub-carbonas_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         LIQUOR ARSENICALIS.

E.\r\n\r\nThis is a solution of the _Arsenite of Potass_, coloured and flavoured\r\nby the _Compound Spirit of Lavender_, fʒj of which contains gr. ½ of\r\n_arsenious acid_. It was introduced into practice by Dr. Fowler of\r\nStafford, as a substitute for the empirical remedy known by the name of\r\n“_The Tasteless Ague Drop_.” It is a powerful tonic, and has been very\r\nsuccessfully administered in the cure of intermittent and remittent\r\nfevers, periodical headaches, and as an alterative in many anomalous\r\ndiseases of the skin. It has been also given, with decided effect, in\r\ncertain visceral obstructions; its use however is to a great degree\r\nempirical, although we may observe, generally, that wherever strong\r\narterial action exists, arsenic will do harm. The addition of a few\r\ndrops of _Vinum Opii_ is said to render its operation safer and more\r\nefficacious. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Lime water_; _nitrate of silver_;\r\n_the salts of copper_; _hydro-sulphuret of potass_, and _the infusions\r\nand decoctions of bark_. DOSE, ♏︎iv, gradually increased to ♏︎xxx, twice\r\na day. See _Arsenicum Album_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  LIQUOR CALCIS. L. AQUA CALCIS. E. D.\r\n\r\n                             _Lime Water._\r\n\r\nIt is a saturated solution of lime in water; f℥j of which contains 3/4\r\nof a grain.[553] INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _All alkaline and metallic\r\nsalts_; _borates_; _tartrates_; _citrates_; _acids_; sulphur;\r\n_spirituous preparations_, and _the infusions of all astringent\r\nvegetables_. It should be kept in close vessels, for if exposed to the\r\nair, the lime will attract carbonic acid, and become an insoluble\r\ncarbonate; the addition of an _alkaline carbonate_ produces the same\r\neffect instantaneously.[554] If animal charcoal be boiled with\r\nlime-water, it will precipitate the whole of the lime, an effect which\r\nis not produced by charcoal of vegetable origin. MED. USES. It is an\r\nantacid, and is therefore useful in dyspepsia attended with acidity;\r\n_Form. 149_. Mixed with an equal quantity of milk, it furnishes an\r\nexcellent remedy in infantile complaints connected with bowel\r\naffections; it is likewise astringent in leucorrhæa, in the last stages\r\nof dysentery, and in protracted diarrhœa. It dissolves also the slimy\r\nmucus with which disordered bowels are so generally infested; on account\r\nof this latter property, it has been exhibited in calculous\r\naffections,[555] with the view of dissolving the cementing ingredient of\r\nthe concretion, and thereby of destroying its cohesion: see page 123.\r\nNot being very nauseous, it is easily given under any circumstances, and\r\nit is not liable to produce that irritability of stomach which\r\nfrequently attends the long continued use of the fixed alkalies. It also\r\nfrequently forms the basis of astringent gargles. Lime water moreover\r\naffords a successful remedy in certain cutaneous affections,\r\nparticularly those affecting the face, as _Gutta Rosea_. Sir G. Blane\r\nhas also seen some remarkable cures of herpetic complaints of the legs\r\nby large doses; he has also employed it with effect as a lotion. FORMS\r\nOF EXHIBITION.

The\r\npreparation, although perfectly transparent when first formed, soon\r\nbecomes turbid and deposits oxide of copper; this arises from the escape\r\nof ammonia, and may be prevented by the occasional addition of a small\r\nquantity of the volatile alkali.

It is by no means ascertained.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. It is a most injudicious preparation, for it\r\ncannot be exhibited in any form without decomposition; _water_,\r\nespecially if not distilled, and _vegetable infusions_ and _decoctions_,\r\nproduce dense precipitates; _pure acids_, _alkalies_, and _spirit_, also\r\ndecompose it. I must confess my regret at the College having retained\r\nthis preparation in their Pharmacopœia; the committee agreed to reject\r\nit, but their judgment was reversed by the votes of the _Comitia\r\nMajora_. Should any practitioner be unable to procure this preparation,\r\nI will give him an easy receipt for producing it, viz. _Let him keep the\r\nMistura Ferri composita in an open vessel, until it is entirely spoilt_!\r\n\r\n\r\n                   LIQUOR HYDRARGYRI OXY-MURIATIS. L.\r\n\r\nThis solution of corrosive sublimate is intended to facilitate the\r\nexhibition of minute doses of the salt; f℥j contains gr. ½; when long\r\nkept, or exposed to light, the oxy-muriate is decomposed, and _calomel_\r\nis precipitated; (see _Hydrag: Oxymuriatis:_) or, what is more\r\ndangerous, it is sometimes deposited in crystals, without decomposition;\r\na small portion of muriatic acid, or muriate of ammonia in the solution,\r\nprevents this precipitation.

Goulard of Montpellier, hence it\r\nhas been commonly known by the name of _Goulard’s Extract_. QUALITIES.\r\nIt is of a greenish straw colour, and has an austere, sweetish taste;\r\nwhen kept it deposits a quantity of oxide, and becomes lighter coloured.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a saturated solution of the sub-acetate of\r\nlead, consisting, according to Berzelius, of one proportional of acid,\r\nand three proportionals of oxide of lead; hence its name is correct. It\r\nis the only instance with which we are acquainted of a real sub-salt\r\nbeing soluble in water. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ and _their\r\ncarbonates_ precipitate a white sub-salt; _alkaline sulphates_ and\r\n_sulphurets_; _mucilage_. _Spring Water_, from the salts which it\r\ncontains, produces with it a very milky and turbid appearance; and even\r\nwhen _distilled_, in consequence of the carbonic acid diffused through\r\nit, it occasions precipitation. The Surgeon will remember that the\r\n_Linimentum Saponis_ cannot be mixed with it, without mutual\r\ndecomposition. _See Sapo._ MED. USES. It is only used externally, in\r\nsuperficial and phlegmonic inflammations of the skin, and in herpetic\r\naffections. It has been a question whether _Lead_, in any form, should\r\never be applied to an open wound, or to an abraded surface;[556] as a\r\ngeneral rule, it should not certainly be applied to such as are recent,\r\nnor to those whose character indicates a diminished state of vitality in\r\nthe parts, and exhibits a disposition to gangrene. The abuse of\r\nSaturnine lotions has been frequently descanted upon by foreign writers,\r\nand, among the evils which are supposed to be thus induced, impotence is\r\nmentioned as one of not unfrequent occurrence. See _Institutioni di\r\nMedicina Forens_: _di Tortosa, vol._ 1. p. 58. also _Fritze Compend:\r\nsopra le Malat: Vener_: p. 189. and _Monteggia Annotat: sopra i Mali\r\nVenerei_, p. 36. There is a paper in the third volume of the _Medical\r\nTransactions_, by Dr. Reynolds, in which the case of a gentleman is\r\ndetailed, who brought on a temporary paralysis of the _Sphincter Ani_,\r\nby freely using Goulard’s lotion for the cure of the Piles.

SOLUBILITY.\r\nAlthough it requires 2000 times its weight of water to hold it in\r\nsolution, yet it has the property of considerably increasing the\r\nsolubility of camphor, opium, and resins in the same fluid; it is\r\nsoluble in solutions of the alkaline carbonates, but not in those of\r\ncaustic alkalies. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is an oxide of a peculiar\r\nmetal. MEDICINAL USES. Antacid, and when acidity prevails, purgative; it\r\nis preferable to the carbonate whenever the bowels are distended with\r\nflatus, (_Form: 150_): in other respects, its virtues are the same. See\r\n_Magnes. Carb_. The Medicinal Dynameter will shew the equivalent doses\r\nof the pure earth and its carbonate; it will be seen for instance that\r\n12 grains of the former will be as efficient, as an antacid, as 25\r\ngrains of the latter. INCIDENTAL IMPURITIES. It ought not to effervesce\r\nwith acids, and if magnesia and muriatic acid be placed at one time in\r\nseparate cups, in a scale of a balance, no diminution of weight should\r\ntake place on mixing them. Lime is detected by its solution in dilute\r\nsulphuric acid affording a precipitate with oxalate of ammonia; the\r\n_sulphuret of lime_ betrays itself by yielding, when moistened, the\r\nsmell of sulphuretted hydrogen.[559]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       MAGNESIÆ SUB-CARBONAS.

Dr. Thompson entertains a\r\ndifferent opinion, he observes that it seems to be a mechanical mixture\r\nof carbonate of magnesia, caustic magnesia, and perhaps of hydrated\r\nmagnesia; he found too great a diversity in its composition to permit\r\nthe conclusion that it was a definite chemical compound; in a specimen\r\npurchased at Glasgow, he also found six per cent. of _sulphate of lime_.\r\nI take this opportunity of stating that in some specimens which I have\r\nexamined, I have also detected portions of _gypsum_; and from the\r\nexperiments of Dr. Percival, it appears that if _hard water_ be employed\r\nfor its preparation it will be less light, and will contain a portion of\r\nlime. Magnesia will be also liable to contain traces of silicious earth,\r\nderived from the alkali used in producing it. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.\r\n_Acids, and acidulous salts; alkalies and neutral salts; alum; cream of\r\ntartar; nitrate of silver; acetate of mercury; oxy-muriate of mercury;\r\nacetate of lead; sulphates of zinc, copper, and iron._ MEDICINAL USES.\r\nAntacid, and purgative. In cases of lithic calculi, carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, in doses of ℈j to ʒj, has been proposed by Mr. Hatchett, as a\r\nvaluable substitute for alkaline remedies. Its insolubility must render\r\nits absorption equivocal; its beneficial operation must therefore\r\nprincipally depend upon its neutralizing any excess of acid in the primæ\r\nviæ, and in this way there can be no doubt of its lithonthryptic agency;\r\n“but,” says Dr. Marcet, “such is the tendency which the public has to\r\nover-rate the utility of a new practice, or to take a mistaken view of\r\nits proper application, that there is every reason to believe that the\r\nuse of magnesia has of late years become a frequent source of evil in\r\ncalculous complaints.” _See_ page 124.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. In its\r\ncrystallized state, it may be considered as composed of 1 proportional\r\nof dry sulphate (Magnesia 18·5, and sulphuric acid 37·5) and 7\r\nproportionals of water. SOLUBILITY. f℥j of water dissolves ℥j, and the\r\nsolution measures fʒxj¼; it is insoluble in alcohol. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. _Muriates of ammonia, baryta, and lime_; _nitrate of\r\nsilver_; _sub-acetate_, and _acetate of lead_. _The fixed alkalies_ and\r\n_their carbonates_, precipitate from it magnesia and its carbonate.\r\n_Phosphate of soda_ occasions no immediate precipitate, unless ammonia\r\nbe present, in which case the triple _ammoniaco-magnesian phosphate_\r\nwill be produced. The addition of ammonia, which in the form of\r\n_Spiritus ammoniæ aromat_. is not unfrequently prescribed in conjunction\r\nwith a solution of this sulphate, forms also a triple salt, and a\r\nportion of magnesia is precipitated: whenever therefore this ammoniacal\r\nstimulant is ordered with a purgative salt, the scientific physician\r\nwill prefer a solution of the sulphate of soda. FORMS OF EXHIBITION.\r\nDissolved in the _Infusum Rosæ_, or in a suitable quantity of beef tea,\r\ngruel, or any aqueous vehicle, its cathartic powers are increased by\r\ndilution, as well as by the addition of a little common salt; _magnesia_\r\nrenders the taste of its solution less nauseous; and tartarized antimony\r\nquickens its operation. DOSE, ℥ss to ℥ij, taken either at once, or in\r\ndivided doses. _Form. 37, 69, 72, 76._ OFFICINAL PREP. _Enema\r\nCatharticum._ _Enema Fœtid._ D. ADULTERATIONS. _Sulphate of Soda_ is\r\noften substituted for this salt, which it may be made to resemble by\r\nstirring it briskly at the moment when it is about to crystallize; the\r\nfraud may be detected by a precipitation not ensuing on adding carbonate\r\nof potass; if only a part of the salt be sulphate of soda, the degree of\r\nsophistication can be learnt by the quantity of the precipitate formed;\r\n100 parts of sulphate of magnesia, if pure, will yield between 30 and 40\r\nof the dry carbonate. Epsom salt, as it commonly occurs, contains\r\n_muriate of magnesia_, which disposes it to deliquesce, but lately this\r\nsalt has appeared in the market in a state of great purity and beauty;\r\nthe mode of purification is founded upon the well known chemical law,\r\nthat _a saturated solution of one salt is still capable of dissolving\r\nanother_; in the present instance, therefore, the impure crystals are\r\nwashed in a saturated solution of the same sulphate, which, although\r\nunable to act upon its kindred salt, can dissolve with facility the\r\nmuriate, and any other saline contamination. I confess, however, that I\r\nam induced to regard this process as rather chemically ingenious than as\r\nmedicinally useful, for the usual saline impurities of Epsom salt are\r\nnot only harmless, but capable of increasing its purgative powers; the\r\n_double refined_ sulphate is certainly less efficient as a cathartic.\r\nThe presence of the _muriate_ may be at once detected by dropping upon\r\nthe suspected sample some sulphuric acid, by which the disengagement of\r\nmuriatic acid vapour will be produced. Since the publication of the\r\nfourth edition of the present work, I have received samples of the\r\nsulphate of Magnesia, prepared by Mr. West of Lymington, and I can\r\nconfidently recommend the article to the profession; he contrives to\r\nobtain them in large and beautiful crystals, which cannot be so easily\r\nmistaken for those of oxalic acid, a circumstance of no small importance\r\nto the drug vender; the form of these crystals is that of a square\r\nprism, having its edges replaced, and commonly terminated by a pyramid\r\nof four planes; the only cleavage is parallel to one of the diagonals of\r\nthe prism. The numerous accidents which so frequently occur from\r\nmistaking Oxalic acid for Epsom Salts have given rise to many\r\nsuggestions for obtaining an easy and popular test which may at once\r\ndistinguish these bodies; it is evident that no test can be so simple as\r\nthat afforded by the taste; but if such accidents are in future to be\r\nprevented, it must be done by imparting to the acid some external\r\ncharacter by which it may be at once recognised; if a test were even\r\ndiscovered a hundred times more sensible than any which we possess, what\r\nwould it avail?\r\n\r\n\r\n                           MANNA.[561] L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                 (Fraxinus Ornus. _Succus Concretus._)\r\n\r\n                                _Manna._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, flakes of a granular texture; _Colour_, whitish, or\r\npale yellow; _Odour_, slight but peculiar; _Taste_, nauseous sweet, with\r\nsome degree of bitterness.

L. This is nearly the same as the celebrated\r\nanti-hectic mixture of Dr. Griffith; to the result of the decompositions\r\nwhich take place from the mixture of its ingredients, it is wholly\r\nindebted for its medicinal energies; thus, a _proto-carbonate of iron_\r\nis formed, i. e. the iron combined with carbonic acid is at its\r\n_minimum_ of oxidation, which renders it more active than the common\r\ncarbonate, and probably less stimulant than the sulphate; this product,\r\nby means of the saponaceous compound formed by the union of the myrrh\r\nwith the excess of alkali, is _partly_ diffused and suspended in the\r\nmixture, and _partly_ dissolved, whilst at the same time a _sulphate of\r\npotass_ is formed, which serves to correct the astringent influence\r\nwhich iron is apt to exert upon the bowels. The iron in this preparation\r\nis disposed to combine with an additional proportion of oxygen, hence\r\nits ingredients should be quickly mixed together, and it ought to be\r\nconsidered as an extemporaneous preparation, and be preserved in a\r\nclosely-stopt vessel. Its change of colour will generally indicate its\r\nloss of efficacy. This preparation must be regarded as permanently\r\nserviceable in Chlorosis, and the numerous sympathetic affections\r\nconnected with it. In the painful swellings which infest the breasts of\r\nchlorotic young women, I have found it almost a specific. DOSE,\r\nf℥j-f℥ij. The proportion of _Proto-carbonate of iron_, contained in any\r\ngiven quantity of this mixture, may be found by referring to the\r\nMedicinal Dynameter; for instance, bring the preparation to 12, and we\r\nshall perceive that this number of fluid-drachms contain 1 grain of\r\n_Protoxide_, or rather more than gr. iss of _Proto-carbonate_ of iron;\r\nand we shall, at the same time, perceive that to give an equivalent\r\nquantity in the form of _Pil. Ferri comp_. we must prescribe ℈j. See\r\n_Form. 96_.\r\n\r\nMISTURA MOSCHI. This is an eligible form for the administration of Musk.\r\n_Dose_, f℥j-f℥ij, to which may be added extemporaneously, ammonia,\r\næther, and other diffusible stimulants.\r\n\r\n_The Dose_ of the above mixtures is f℥j-to f℥ij twice or thrice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        MOSCHUS. L.E.D. _Musk._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, grains concreted together, dry, yet slightly\r\nunctuous. _Colour_, deep brown with a shade of red; _Odour_, aromatic,\r\npeculiar, diffusive, and durable; and it has the curious property, when\r\nadded in a minute quantity, to augment the odour of other perfumes\r\nwithout imparting its own; this renders it a valuable article in\r\nperfumery, on which account it is a usual ingredient in lavender water.\r\n_Taste_, bitterish and heavy. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Resin combined with\r\nvolatile oil, and a mucilaginous extractive matter, with small portions\r\nof albumen, gelatine, muriate of ammonia, and phosphate of soda.\r\nSOLUBILITY. Boiling water dissolves it perfectly; rectified spirit takes\r\nup most of its active parts, although the odour is only discovered upon\r\ndilution; sulphuric æther is its most complete menstruum. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. The solutions are decomposed by _Oxy-muriate of Mercury_;\r\n_Sulphate of Iron_; _Nitrate of Silver_; and the _Infusion of Yellow\r\nBark_. MED. USES. Stimulant and antispasmodic. As early as the time of\r\nMeade it was employed in typhus fever; Pringle administered it in gout\r\nof the stomach, a practice which received the concurrence of Cullen;\r\nconjoined with ammonia it has been celebrated for its powers in\r\narresting the progress of gangrene, and of imparting fresh excitement to\r\nthe nervous system. It has been also administered with success in\r\nepilepsy, hooping cough, and other spasmodic affections. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. The best form is that of bolus, combined with ammonia or\r\ncamphor, or some other similar remedy, (_Form. 21_); it may be also\r\nadministered in a mixture, for which purpose it requires five times its\r\nweight of mucilage, consequently the London College has not directed a\r\nsufficient quantity to retain the musk in suspension: by previously\r\ntriturating it with sugar, its minute division is much facilitated.\r\nDOSE, grs. x to xxx. See _Form. 22, 30_. OFFICINAL PREP. _Mist. Mosch_.\r\nL. _Tinct. Mosch_. D. ADULTERATIONS. The bag containing the musk should\r\nhave no appearance of having been opened: the presence of _dried blood_\r\nmay be suspected, by its emitting, as it inflames, a fetid smoke;\r\n_Asphaltum_ is discovered by its melting and running before it inflames:\r\nthe artificial bags are known from the deficiency of the membrane which\r\nlines the real musk bags. To increase the weight of the musk, fine\r\nparticles of lead are frequently added; this is easily detected, for by\r\nrubbing it with water the metallic particles will subside.\r\n\r\nMOSCHUS FACTITIUS. _Artificial Musk_, strongly resembling the real, may\r\nbe formed by digesting f℥ss of _Nitric Acid_, for ten days, upon ℥j of\r\nfetid animal oil, obtained by distillation; to this is to be next\r\ngradually added oj of _rectified spirit_, and the whole is then to be\r\nleft to digest for one month: or—\r\n\r\n  2. Drop fʒiiiss of nitric acid upon fʒj of rectified oil of amber;\r\n      after standing twenty-four hours, a black, resinous pellicle,\r\n      exhaling the odour of musk, will be formed.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUCILAGO ACACIÆ. L.E.\r\n\r\n                       MUCILAGO GUMMI ARABICI. D.\r\n\r\nThis preparation consists of one part of gum and two of water; in\r\npreparing it, the dispenser is particularly recommended to pulverize the\r\ngum, and never to employ that which is purchased in the state of powder,\r\nas it is always impure and incapable of forming a pellucid and elegant\r\nsolution.[564] INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. Neither the _strong acids_ nor\r\n_alcohol_, when considerably diluted, occasion any disturbance in it;\r\nbut _sulphuric æther_ and its _compound spirit_, _the tincture of\r\nmuriated iron_, and _sub-acetate of lead_, produce very dense\r\nprecipitates: the _acetate of lead_ only occasions decomposition, when\r\nan alkaline salt is present in the formula; the _volatile alkali_\r\ncurdles the mucilage, and _hard calcareous waters_ render the mixture\r\ndifficult and often impracticable. In the pharmaceutical application of\r\nthis mucilage, it should be remembered that it contains in its\r\ncomposition an astringent principle, which is perhaps of but trifling\r\nconsequence except in the exhibition of some very few active metallic\r\nsalts, which are certainly decomposed by it (e. g. grs. x of _nitrate of\r\nmercury_ are decomposed by ʒij of gum arabic.[565]) It contains also\r\nlime in combination with some vegetable acid. USES. Diluted with four\r\ntimes its bulk of water, this mucilage forms a demulcent mixture of\r\nappropriate tenacity, which affords a convenient vehicle for several\r\nefficient remedies; the pharmaceutical use of this mucilage depends upon\r\nthe fact of its rendering expressed and essential oils, balsams, resins,\r\ngum-resins, resinous tinctures, and fatty bodies, miscible with water,\r\nbut if a syrup be added, the union will be more perfect; the proportions\r\nnecessary for this purpose vary according to the nature of the\r\nsubstances; thus, _oils_ will require about three-fourths their weight,\r\n_Balsams_ and _Spermaceti_ an equal part, _Resins_ a double quantity,\r\nand _Musk_ five times its weight; the following _Formulæ_ illustrate\r\nthis property, 9, 19, 22, 135.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MUCILAGO AMYLI.

E.D.\r\n\r\n                         _Tragacanth Mucilage._\r\n\r\nTragacanth is, strictly speaking, not soluble in water, but imbibes a\r\nlarge portion of it and swells into a considerable bulk, forming a soft\r\nbut not a liquid mucilage; on the farther addition of water, a fluid\r\nsolution may be obtained by agitation, and the liquor is turbid; but on\r\nstanding, the mucilage subsides, the limpid water on the surface\r\nretaining a little of the gum;[566] it differs from all gums in giving a\r\nthick consistence to a larger quantity of water, its power in this\r\nrespect being to that of gum arabic as twenty to one; one part converts\r\ntwenty of hot water into a stiff mucilage. Tragacanth is not increased,\r\nbut actually diminished in solubility by the addition of any other gum,\r\nit accordingly separates from water with much greater facility when gum\r\narabic is present. This preparation, according to the Edinburgh college,\r\nconsists of one part of gum and eight of water; the resulting mucilage\r\nis stiff, and is principally employed for making _troches_. The Dublin\r\npreparation contains four times that quantity of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         MYRISTICÆ NUCLEI. L.E.\r\n\r\n                       Nux Moschata. D. _Nutmeg._\r\n\r\nAll the properties of this well-known substance depend upon an essential\r\noil, filling the dark coloured veins which run through its substance,\r\nthe other components are starch, gum, wax, and a fixed oil. The oil\r\nobtained by expression is improperly called _oil of mace_, for it would\r\nappear to be a triple compound of fixed oil, volatile oil, and wax, and\r\nwhich, although limpid when first drawn, soon acquires on cooling the\r\nconsistence of spermaceti. _Mace_ is the involucrum of the nut. MED.\r\nUSES. Stimulant, and in large doses, as from ʒij to ʒiij, narcotic,\r\nfrequently producing delirium. _See Cullen Mat. Med. ii. 201._ OFFICINAL\r\nPREP: _Spir: Myristicæ_. L.E.D. FRAUDS. Nutmegs are frequently despoiled\r\nof their essential oil, by being punctured and submitted to the\r\noperation of decoction, the orifices being subsequently closed by\r\npowdered Sassafras; the imposition is detected by the comparative\r\nlightness of the nutmeg, and by its extreme fragility; the holes may\r\nalso be discovered by carefully examining the surface of the nut, after\r\nhaving steeped it in hot water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             MYRRHA.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Resin, gum, essential oil, and some\r\nextractive. SOLUBILITY. When triturated with soft, or distilled water,\r\nnearly the whole appears to be dissolved, forming an opaque, yellowish\r\nsolution, but by rest the greater part is deposited, and not more than\r\none-third is actually dissolved; its solubility, however, in water may\r\nbe increased by trituration with camphor or an alkali; rectified spirit\r\ndissolves it, and the resulting tincture, when diluted, becomes turbid,\r\nalthough no precipitate occurs. MED. USES. Stimulant, as in _Form. 103_.\r\nExpectorant, 132, 133, 138. Emmenagogue, 95, 98, 99. It is also tonic,\r\nand agrees with some constitutions better than any of the bitters.

(Strychnus Nux Vomica.)\r\n\r\n                             _Nux Vomica._\r\n\r\nThis seed has not at present a place in the British pharmacopœiæ; it\r\npresents however several points of interest to the physiologist, the\r\nphysician, and the chemist. Its virulent action upon animals has been\r\nlong known; and it has been administered in combination with gentian in\r\nintermittents.[567] (_Ludovic. Phar._ p. 113,) and as a narcotic in\r\nmania; it also constituted an ingredient in the famous _Electuarium de\r\novo_, (_Ph. Angl. p. 263._) Nux vomica has been said to produce benefit\r\nin the plague; the German writers have strongly commended it in mania,\r\nepilepsy, and hydrophobia; as well as in chronic rheumatism, gout,\r\nscrophula, lues venera, and cutaneous eruptions; in Sweden it is stated\r\nto have displayed very beneficial effects in Dysentery. Dr. Fourquier\r\nhas lately introduced its use in the Hopital de la Charité, in cases of\r\npartial paralysis, and it is said, with very great success.[568] The\r\nvalue of the practice has been since confirmed by the experiments of\r\nDumeril, Majendie, Hebreard, Husson, and Asselin. The dose is four or\r\nfive grains of the powder in pills, during the day. The French codex\r\ncontains two alcoholic extracts of this substance; the one prepared with\r\na strong spirit (22, 32, Beaumé, i. e. from sp. gr. ·915 to ·856,) is\r\nmuch more active and powerful than that made with a weak spirit. (12,\r\n22, Beaumé, i. e. from sp. gr. ·985 to ·915.)\r\n\r\nM. M. Pelletier and Caventou have discovered in this substance, a\r\npeculiar proximate principle, to which its virulence is owing; it was\r\nnamed _Vauqueline_, in honour of the celebrated French philosopher, but\r\nin deference to the opinion of the French Academy of Sciences, the\r\ndiscoverers have substituted the name _Strychnia_, because “a name\r\ndearly loved, ought not to be applied to a noxious principle!”[569]\r\n(_Annales de Chimie_, _vol._ 8 to 10.) Strychnia is highly alkaline, and\r\ncrystallizes in very small four-sided prisms, terminated by four-sided\r\npyramids; its taste is insupportably bitter, leaving a slight metallic\r\nflavour, and is so powerful as even to be perceptible when a grain is\r\ndissolved in eighty pounds of water;[570] it has no smell; is not\r\nchanged by exposure to the air, nor is it either fusible or volatile,\r\nfor when submitted to the action of heat, it only fuses at the moment of\r\nits decomposition which takes place at a temperature inferior to that\r\nwhich destroys most vegetable substances; it is so extremely active and\r\nviolent, that in doses of half a grain it occasions serious effects, and\r\nin larger ones convulsions and death; it is perhaps the most\r\npowerful,[571] and next to hydro-cyanic acid, the most rapid of poisons;\r\nnotwithstanding its strong taste, it is very sparingly soluble in water,\r\nrequiring 6667 parts of that fluid for its solution at 50, and 2500 at\r\n212°. It is very soluble in alcohol, but unlike most of the other\r\nvegetable alkalies, is nearly insoluble in æther; with acids it forms\r\nneutral and crystallizable salts; these salts as well as their base,\r\nhave the singular property of becoming bloodred by the action of\r\nconcentrated nitric acid. The alcoholic solution of Strychnia has the\r\nproperty of precipitating the greater number of metallic oxides from\r\ntheir acid solutions. It is precipitated by alkalies and alkaline\r\nearths. Strychnia exists in native combination in the Strychnus with an\r\nacid which has some analogy with the malic, and which Pelletier and\r\nCaventou propose to call the _Igasuric acid_, from the Malay name for\r\nthe bean of St. Ignatius,[572] (Strychnus Ignatius,) in which its\r\nproperties were first examined. In conformity with such views, the\r\nactive principle of the tribe of Strychni is an _Igasurate of\r\nStrychnia_;—a fact which suggests the existence of a most singular and\r\nstriking analogy between the chemical constitution of these\r\nnarcotico-acrid bodies[573] and that of opium. The recent experiments of\r\nPelletier have shewn, moreover, that besides Strychnia, the Nux Vomica\r\ncontains _Brucia_, an alkaline body which had been previously discovered\r\nin spurious Angustura. Its properties are similar to those of Strychnia,\r\nbut it is less active. Being much more soluble in alcohol than\r\n_Strychnia_, if care be taken to crystallize the latter several times in\r\nalcohol, it will be separated, the _Brucia_ remaining in the _mother\r\nwaters_. Strychnia has been given in doses of one-twelfth of a grain,\r\nbut it is a most dangerous remedy, and is liable to occasion tetanic\r\nconvulsions.[574] It has been said, however, to prove serviceable in\r\ncases of Epilepsy that had resisted every other method of cure. Dr.\r\nFleming informs us that the Hindoos of upper India are in the habit of\r\nadding Nux Vomica in the process of distilling Arrack, for the purpose\r\nof rendering the spirit more intoxicating. The London Porter brewers\r\nhave been accused of the same pernicious practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 OLEA DESTILLATA. L. OL. VOLATILIA. E.\r\n\r\n                          OL. ESSENTIALIA. D.\r\n\r\n               _Distilled, Volatile, or Essential Oils._\r\n\r\nThe British pharmacopœiæ direct them to be obtained by distillation\r\nonly; the French codex orders several of them to be prepared by\r\nexpression. QUALITIES. _Form_, liquid, sometimes viscid; _specific\r\ngrav._ various; oil of turpentine, which is the lightest, being only\r\n0·792, whilst the oil of cloves, cinnamon, and allspice, exceed 1·030,\r\nand that of sassafras, which is the heaviest, amounts to 1·094; these\r\nlatter oils hold resin in solution, and of course sink in water.\r\n_Odour_, penetrating and fragrant; _Taste_, acrid; they are volatilized\r\nat a temperature somewhat below that of boiling water; they are very\r\ninflammable. SOLUBILITY. Very soluble in alcohol, forming what are\r\ntermed in perfumery _Essences_; in water they are very sparingly\r\nsoluble; the solutions are known in pharmacy under the title of\r\n_distilled waters_; they are also dissolved by æther, and the _fixed_\r\noils; when digested with ammonia, some of the less odorous acquire a\r\nconsiderable degree of fragrance, whilst on the contrary, fixed alkalies\r\nuniversally impair their odour; they are rapidly decomposed by nitric\r\nand sulphuric acids, and their action is sometimes attended with instant\r\ninflammation. Volatile oils, from continued exposure to the air, absorb\r\noxygen, and become resinous, by which they lose their volatility,\r\nfragrance, and pungency, hence they should be preserved in small opaque\r\nphials, completely full and well stopped. MED. USES. They act as\r\npowerful stimulants and aromatics; they remove nausea and flatulence,\r\ncorrect the griping of certain purgatives, and cover the offensive taste\r\nof various remedies. See _Aquæ destillatæ_. They, moreover, have the\r\nproperty of defending certain animal and vegetable preparations from\r\nmouldiness. This curious fact has been already noticed, see _page 177_.\r\nThe following is a list of the species admitted into our British\r\npharmacopœiæ; those designated in _italics_ are principally for internal\r\nuse.

ADULTERATIONS. _Fixed\r\nOils_ may be detected by moistening writing paper with the suspected\r\narticle and holding it before the fire: if the oil be entirely\r\nessential, no stain of grease will remain; as castor oil is more soluble\r\nin spirit than the others, it is the one generally selected for this\r\nfraudulent purpose, and the addition of alcohol restores the\r\nsophisticated oil to its proper degree of consistency. _Alcohol_ is\r\ndiscovered by adding water, which, if it be present, occasions a\r\nmilkiness, and at the same time, an increase of temperature; a decrease\r\nof bulk also takes place, which may easily be ascertained by measuring\r\nthe oil and water separately, and then transferring them, in a state of\r\nmixture, into a tube of small diameter. _Cheaper oils_, as that of\r\nturpentine, are recognised by their peculiar odour, which may be\r\ndeveloped by rubbing a drop upon the hand and holding it to the fire,\r\nor, by the dense black smoke with which they burn. The oil of aniseed,\r\nas it crystallizes at 50°, is frequently sophisticated with wax,\r\nspermaceti, or camphor; the fraud is detected by warming the oil, when\r\nthe crystals, if genuine, will dissolve.[575] In some cases the\r\nrefractive power of the oil affords a test of its purity. _See my work\r\non Chemistry in its relations to Medicine, § 318._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          OLEA EXPRESSA.

QUALITIES. _Odour_, none; _Taste_,\r\nmild; they boil at 600°, but undergo decomposition, becoming acrid and\r\nempyreumatic; the oil, in this state, was formerly used in medicine\r\nunder the name of _philosopher’s oil_.[576] By exposure to air they\r\nabsorb oxygen and become rancid; they congeal at a temperature of 32°,\r\nand some even above that. When the oil is expressed by heating the\r\nplates of the press, or by previously roasting the seeds, it is more\r\ndisposed to become rancid; _cold drawn_ oils are on this account to be\r\npreferred for the purposes of pharmacy. SOLUBILITY. They are insoluble\r\nin water, and, except castor oil, nearly so in alcohol and æther; with\r\ncaustic alkalies they combine and form soaps; when aided by heat they\r\nreadily unite with oxide of lead, forming the solid compound well known\r\nby the term _plaister_. They unite also very readily with each other,\r\nand with volatile oils. SOLVENT POWERS. They dissolve sulphur, and form\r\na kind of balsam with it; they also possess the power of extracting and\r\ndissolving the narcotic and acrid principles of several vegetable and\r\nanimal substances, in consequence of which, the French pharmacopœia\r\ndirects a series of preparations under the term “_Olea Medicata_;” thus\r\nthere are olea Cicutæ, Hyoscyami, Solani, Stramonii, Nicotianæ;[577]\r\nwhich are made by digesting with a gentle heat, one part of the subject\r\nin two parts of olive oil.[578]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       OLEUM AMYGDALARUM. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                           _Oil of Almonds._\r\n\r\nThis fixed oil, whether procured from the _sweet_ or _bitter_ almond,\r\nhas the same properties, for the bitter principle resides exclusively in\r\ncombination with a peculiar volatile oil attached to the mucilage;[579]\r\nthat from the latter keeps longer without rancidity. It is sometimes\r\nmade from old Jordan almonds, _by heat_, in which case it very soon\r\ngrows fetid. Nut oil, _Oleum nucum Coryli_, has been proposed as a\r\nsubstitute for that of almonds; in China it is drunk with tea, instead\r\nof cream. MEDICAL USES. For forming emulsions, in coughs, and other\r\npulmonary complaints. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may be formed into an\r\n_emulsion_ by the intermedium of _mucilage_, the _yelk of an egg_, or by\r\nthat of an _alkali_.\r\n\r\n1. BY MUCILAGE. This is in general a more convenient medium than the\r\nyelk of an egg; one part of gum, made into mucilage, will be sufficient\r\nfor the diffusion of four parts of oil, (see _Mucilago Acaciæ_) the oil\r\nand mucilage must be carefully triturated together, and the water then\r\ngradually added; the emulsion thus formed is permanent, and the addition\r\nof a moderate quantity of acid, spirit, or tincture, will not produce\r\ndecomposition. _See Form. 73._\r\n\r\n2. BY ALKALIES. This oil, by uniting with alkalies and water, forms an\r\nelegant and grateful mixture, for which purpose the following\r\nproportions are to be observed, every fʒj of oil requires ♏︎viij of\r\nliquor potassæ, and f℥iss of distilled water. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.\r\n_Acids_; _oxymel_; _syrups of poppies and squills_; _tartrate and\r\nsuper-tartrate of potass_; _super-sulphate of potass_; _oxy-muriate of\r\nmercury_; _resins_; _hard water_. _See Form. 166, 167._\r\n\r\n\r\n                     OLEUM AMYGDALÆ AMARÆ VOLATILE.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Colour_, pale yellow; _Odour_, fragrant and pungent, having\r\nthe characteristic smell of prussic acid. _Taste_, pungent, bitter, and\r\npeculiar. SOLUBILITY. Like other essential oils, its sensible properties\r\nand medicinal effects are imparted to water; in alcohol it is very\r\nsoluble.[580] CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. A peculiar oil, combined with\r\nhydro-cyanic acid. M. Vogel of Munich has lately succeeded in separating\r\nthese constituents, by agitating the whole in a concentrated solution of\r\npotass, and distilling to dryness; the oil volatilized together with\r\nwater, while the residuum in the retort was found to contain _Cyanide of\r\nPotassium_. The volatile oil, thus purified, is without odour, and\r\nheavier than water. Its taste is extremely acrid and burning; by contact\r\nwith air it crystallizes rapidly; it dissolves easily in alcohol and\r\næther, but only in a very small proportion in water. The flame of its\r\ncombustion is very brilliant, and accompanied with much smoke. In order\r\nto discover whether this oil, when freed from its hydro-cyanic acid, is\r\nstill poisonous, M. Vogel put a drop of it on the tongue of a sparrow;\r\nwhen it died, after violent convulsions, in a few seconds; he also\r\npoisoned a dog, two months old, with four drops of it; whence he\r\nconcludes that the volatile oil, divested of its hydro-cyanic acid, is\r\nstill a poison, although less energetic than the oil that has not\r\nundergone such a change. _Med: Uses._ It has all the characteristic\r\neffects of prussic acid, but is so powerful and dangerous as to preclude\r\nits application. It is principally sold to perfumers and confectioners.\r\n\r\nIt is generally obtained by distilling the expressed cake of bitter\r\nalmonds; the operation however requires considerable pharmaceutical\r\naddress, and is, moreover, attended with unpleasant consequences.[581]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    OLEUM OLIVÆ. L.E.D. _Olive Oil._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Colour_, pale yellow, somewhat inclining to green; _Taste_,\r\nbland; _Odour_, none; it ought to congeal at 38° _Fah_. With the\r\nexception of the oil of Almonds, it is the lightest of the fat oils, its\r\nspecific gravity being only ·915. According to the recent observations\r\nof Dr. Clarke of Cambridge, this oil crystallizes in rectangular\r\nfour-sided prisms with square bases. USES. Although much less laxative\r\nthan Castor oil, it is a useful aperient. It was long regarded, but\r\nerroneously, as possessing antidotal powers against the bites of\r\nvenemous snakes and insects; and it has been confidently recommended, in\r\nthe form of liniment, as a remedy against the Plague. OFFICINAL\r\nPREPARATIONS. _Linimentum Ammoniæ Fortius_. L. ADULTERATIONS. It is not\r\nunfrequently mixed with the oil of poppy seeds, (see _Papaveris\r\nCapsulæ_), a fraud which may be easily discovered by exposing a sample\r\nto the freezing temperature, when the olive oil will congeal, while that\r\nof poppies will remain fluid; and since those oils which freeze with\r\nmost difficulty are most susceptible of rancidity, the admixture of\r\npoppy oil must be regarded as injurious: it also deserves notice that\r\nthe peculiar habitudes of _Oil of Olives_, with the _Pernitrate of\r\nMercury_, offer a distinguishing character, by which the adulteration of\r\nthe oil may be satisfactorily detected; for if the _pernitrate_, made by\r\ndissolving 6 parts of the metal in 7·5 of nitric acid, of sp. grav.\r\n1·36, at a common temperature, be mixed with olive oil, the mixture, if\r\nkept cold, will in the course of a few hours become solid, whereas if it\r\nhas any admixture of the oil of grains, it will not undergo such a\r\nchange. The contamination derived from lead, which is frequently\r\nimmersed in the oil for the purpose of removing its rancidity, may be\r\ndetected by shaking one part of the suspected sample with three parts of\r\nwater, impregnated with sulphuretted hydrogen, in a stopped phial.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             OLIBANUM. L.D.\r\n\r\n                    Juniperus Lycia. _Gummi-resina._\r\n\r\n                             Olibanum.[582]\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, fragments of a translucent, whitish yellow, and\r\ngenerally powdered with a whitish dust, occasioned by the friction of\r\nthe pieces against each other; _Odour_, when burning is fragrant;\r\n_Taste_, bitterish and acrid. SOLUBILITY. When triturated with water, a\r\nmilky solution results, which after some time deposits the resinous\r\npart, and retains not more than three-eighths dissolved. Alcohol\r\ndissolves three-fourths of it, and forms a solution perfectly\r\ntransparent. Æther dissolves more than half, leaving a white opaque\r\nresiduum soluble in water. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The latest analysis of\r\nthis substance is by _Braconnot_, who found in 100 parts of it, of\r\nvolatile oil 8, resin 56, gum 39, and of an anomalous principle\r\nresembling gum, but insoluble in water and alcohol, 5·2 parts. The oil,\r\nin colour and smell, very strongly resembled that of lemons. MED. USES.\r\nIt is now less used than formerly; it is however stimulant and\r\ndiaphoretic. Pulverized it enters into several popular electuaries for\r\ngleets, fluor albus, &c. and very probably acts by finding a passage\r\ninto the urine, without undergoing any change or decomposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n   OPIUM. L.E.D. (Papaver Somniferum.) _Capsularum immaturarum Succus\r\n                        concretus._ (Turcicus.)\r\n\r\n                          _Turkey Opium._[583]\r\n\r\nTwo kinds are found in commerce, distinguished by the name of _Turkey_\r\nand _East India_ Opium.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, Turkey opium occurs in flat pieces, of a solid\r\ncompact texture, and possessing considerable tenacity; _Sp. gr._ 1·336,\r\nso that, when compared with the condensed juices of other plants, it is\r\nheavy, being exceeded only in this respect by opoponax and gum-arabic.\r\nBy long exposure to the air it becomes hard, breaks with a glimmering\r\nfracture, owing to the presence of a few saline particles, and affords a\r\nyellowish powder. It is opaque, tenacious, plastic, adherent to the\r\nfingers. _Colour_, a reddish-brown, or fawn. _Odour_, peculiar, heavy,\r\nand narcotic. _Taste_, at first a nauseous bitter, which soon becomes\r\nacrid with some degree of warmth. It is inflammable, but yields no\r\nnarcotic odour on burning. SOLUBILITY. It is partially soluble in water,\r\nalcohol, æther, wine, vinegar, and lemon juice; when triturated with hot\r\nwater, five parts in twelve are dissolved, six suspended, and one part\r\nremains perfectly insoluble and resembles _gluten_. By long boiling, its\r\nsoporific powers are impaired and ultimately destroyed: the alcoholic is\r\nmore highly charged with its narcotic principle than the aqueous\r\nsolution; but spirit, rather below proof, is its best menstruum. The\r\nwatery solution when filtered is transparent, and reddens the colour of\r\nlitmus; it undergoes no change on the addition of alcohol, but\r\nprecipitates occur from _pure ammonia_ and from the _carbonates of fixed\r\nalkalies_; from the solutions of _oxy-muriate of mercury_, _nitrate of\r\nsilver_, _sub-acetate and acetate of lead_, the _sulphates of copper,\r\nzinc, and iron_, and from an _infusion of galls_. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\nResin, gum, bitter extractive, sulphate of lime, gluten, _Narcotine_\r\n(_see note_) and a peculiar alkaline body, to which the soporific\r\nvirtues of opium are owing, and to which the appropriate name of\r\n_Morphia_ has been assigned; and it appears moreover that this new\r\nalkaline body exists in combination with an unknown acid, which has\r\ntherefore been denominated the _Meconic Acid_; so that the narcotic\r\nprinciple of opium is _Morphia_ in the state of a _meconiate_, or\r\nperhaps of a _super-meconiate_.\r\n\r\nFor these important facts we are indebted to the successive labours of\r\nDerosne,[584] Seguin,[585] Sertuerner,[586] and Robiquet. And the French\r\ncodex contains, in its appendix, formulæ for the preparation of\r\nmorphia[587] according to the directions of these two latter chemists:\r\nviz. _Robiquet’s_ process. Three hundred parts of pure opium are to be\r\nmacerated during five days, in one thousand parts of common water; to\r\nthe filtered solution, fifteen parts of perfectly pure magnesia\r\n(carefully avoiding the _carbonate_,) are to be added; boil this mixture\r\nfor ten minutes, and separate the sediment by a filter, washing it with\r\ncold water until the water passes off clear; after which, treat it\r\nalternately with hot and cold alcohol, (12, 22, Bé.) as long as the\r\nmenstruum takes up any colouring matter; the residue is then to be\r\ntreated with boiling alcohol (22, 32, Bé.) for a few minutes. The\r\nsolution, on cooling, will deposit crystals of _Morphia_.\r\n\r\n_Rationale of the Process._ A soluble _Meconiate of Magnesia_ is formed,\r\nwhilst the sediment consists of _Morphia_ in the state of mixture, with\r\nthe excess of magnesia; the boiling alcohol with which this residuum is\r\ntreated, exerts no action upon the magnesia, but dissolves the\r\n_Morphia_, and on cooling surrenders it in a crystalline form. A\r\nrepetition of the treatment with boiling alcohol will procure a fresh\r\ncrop of crystals, and the process should be continued until they cease\r\nto appear.\r\n\r\n_Sertuerner’s_ method. It differs from the preceding, in substituting\r\nammonia for magnesia, and in adding to the sediment, separated as before\r\nmentioned, as much sulphuric acid as is sufficient to convert the\r\n_Morphia_ into a sulphate, which is subsequently decomposed by a farther\r\naddition of ammonia; the precipitate thus produced is then dissolved in\r\nboiling alcohol, which on cooling surrenders the _Morphia_ in a state of\r\ncrystalline purity. It appears however that the _Morphia_ produced by\r\nthis latter method, is less abundant and more impure and coloured, than\r\nthat which is furnished by the process of Robiquet.\r\n\r\n_Characters of Morphia._ When pure, it crystallizes in very fine,\r\ntransparent, truncated pyramids, the bases of which are either squares\r\nor rectangles, occasionally united base to base, and thereby forming\r\noctohedra. It is sparingly soluble in boiling water, but dissolves\r\nabundantly in heated alcohol; and the solution is intensely bitter; in\r\næther it is far less soluble. It has all the characters of an alkali;\r\naffecting test papers, tinged with turmeric or violets; uniting with\r\nacids, and forming neutral salts, and decomposing the compounds of acids\r\nwith metallic oxides. It unites with sulphur by means of heat, but the\r\ncombination is decomposed at the same instant; it is incapable of\r\nforming soap with an oxidized oil. It fuses at a moderate temperature,\r\nwhen it resembles melted sulphur, and like that substance, crystallizes\r\non cooling; it is decomposed by distillation, yielding carbonate of\r\nammonia, oil, and a black resinous residue, with a peculiar smell; when\r\nheated in contact with air, it inflames rapidly; the voltaic pile exerts\r\nbut little action upon it, yet, when mixed with a globule of mercury,\r\nthe latter appears to become increased in bulk, and to change\r\nconsistence. When analyzed by means of the deutoxide of copper, it\r\nyields carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; and if ammonia has been employed,\r\nas a precipitant in its preparation, we shall also obtain some nitrogen,\r\nbut not if prepared according to the improved process of Robiquet. Its\r\nhabitudes with different bodies have not hitherto been sufficiently\r\ninvestigated, but they are highly important, in as much as they will\r\nexplain the operation of those various medicinal compounds, into which\r\nopium enters as a principal ingredient. _Sertuerner_ has given us an\r\naccount of the effect of the alcoholic solution of Morphia on himself\r\nand three of his pupils; he found, that repeated small doses of half a\r\ngrain produced at first decided excitation; then weakness, numbness, and\r\ntendency to fainting; after swallowing vinegar while in this condition,\r\nviolent vomiting was excited, profound sleep intervened in one delicate\r\nindividual, and next day he suffered from nausea, vomiting, head-ache,\r\nanorexia, constipation, and heaviness (_Ann. de Chim. et de Phys_. T.\r\nv.) This case is sufficient to shew that although Morphia possesses the\r\ncharacteristic powers of opium, its strength is by no means commensurate\r\nwith its supposed concentration. When uncombined it exerts little or no\r\naction in consequence of its insolubility. The following history of its\r\nsaline compounds may be useful.\r\n\r\nThe _Carbonate_ crystallizes in short prisms.\r\n\r\nThe _Acetate_ in needles, very soluble, and extremely active.\r\n\r\nThe _Sulphate_, in arborescent crystals, very soluble.\r\n\r\nThe _Muriate_, in plumose crystals, much less soluble; when evaporated,\r\nit concretes into a shining white plumose mass on cooling.\r\n\r\nThe _Nitrates_, in prisms grouped together.\r\n\r\nThe _Meconiate_, in oblique prisms, sparingly soluble.\r\n\r\nThe _Tartrate_, in prisms.\r\n\r\nMorphia is separated from the above combinations by ammonia.\r\n\r\nMorphia is very soluble in olive oil, and according to the experiments\r\nof M. Majendie, the compound acts with great intensity; with extractive\r\nmatter, it forms a compound which is almost insoluble in water, but very\r\nsoluble in acids.\r\n\r\nThe solubility of Morphia in acids explains why the administration of\r\nvinegar increases the powers of opium, (_see_ page 135.) _M. Majendie_\r\nconsiders Morphia to produce a more purely soporose effect than opium,\r\nand that it is moreover exempt from the consecutive operation which so\r\ngenerally renders opium objectionable. This opinion, however, has not\r\nbeen confirmed by the trials made in this country; equally gratuitous is\r\nthe assertion of the same physiologist, that by ringing changes on the\r\nsalts of Morphia, its hypnotic effects may be kept up without increasing\r\nits dose.\r\n\r\nAs _M. Majendie_ considers the _after_ effects of opium to be\r\nindependent of Morphia, it was necessary for him to point out the\r\nparticular principle from which these noxious consequences arose, and he\r\naccordingly ascribed them to the _Salt of Derosne_, now more usually\r\ndenominated _Narcotine_, and which may be entirely removed from the\r\nextract of opium by macerating it in sulphuric æther; and in this way,\r\nit is said, a preparation is obtained, which, like Morphia, is exempt\r\nfrom the occasional bad consequences of the common drug; but no\r\nsatisfactory trials have as yet been made with it.\r\n\r\nThe _Meconic acid_, when separated from the residuum of the magnesian\r\nsalt, as described above, does not appear to possess any medicinal\r\nactivity. Its distinguishing _chemical_ character is, that it produces\r\nan intensely red colour in solutions of iron oxidized _ad maximum_.\r\n\r\nEAST INDIA OPIUM is an inferior species;[588] it differs from _Turkey\r\nOpium_, in its _texture_ being less compact, and much softer; its\r\n_colour_ darker; its narcotic _odour_ fainter, but combined with a\r\nstrong empyreuma, and in its _taste_ being more bitter, but less\r\nacrimonious. According to the experiments of Mr. A. T. Thomson, _Turkey\r\nOpium_ contains three times more morphia than the _East Indian_ variety.\r\nThis latter, when triturated with water, is taken up without any\r\nresiduum; hence it contains no gluten, but the sulphate of lime is more\r\nabundant, as appears from the relative proportion of precipitate\r\nproduced by oxalic acid. The solution of the acetate of barytes, whilst\r\nit occasions no disturbance in the solutions of the Turkey variety,\r\nproduces a copious precipitate with the East Indian.\r\n\r\nMED. USES. Are so well known that a few practical remarks will\r\nsuffice.[589]\r\n\r\nChemistry, it appears, has developed the principle of its activity, and\r\naccumulated experience has established the value and importance of its\r\nmedicinal applications, but Physiology is still unable to demonstrate\r\nthe manner in which it produces its effects. It must be admitted that\r\nits primary operation is that of a powerful and diffusible stimulant,\r\nbut it is immediately followed by narcotic and sedative effects, which\r\nare far greater than could have been inferred from the degree of\r\nprevious excitement, and hence much keen controversy has arisen in the\r\nschools concerning its _modus operandi_, (_see_ page 76.) In large\r\ndoses, the primary excitement is scarcely apparent, but the powers of\r\nlife are instantly depressed, drowsiness and stupor succeed, and when\r\nthe dose is excessive, these are followed by delirium, stertorous\r\nbreathing, cold sweats, convulsions, and apoplectic death. Its stimulant\r\neffects are apparent only in small doses, by which the energy of the\r\nmind,[590] the strength of the pulse, and the heat of the body, are\r\nconsiderably increased, but all the secretions and excretions, except\r\nthe cuticular[591] discharge, are diminished; for example, the fæces of\r\npersons, after the use of opium, are not unfrequently clay-coloured,\r\nfrom the suspension of the biliary secretion; this circumstance suggests\r\nsome important precautions with respect to its exhibition. Opium, when\r\nproperly directed, is capable of fulfilling two great indications; 1st,\r\nof supporting the powers of life, and 2nd, of allaying spasm, pain, and\r\nirritation, and of blunting that morbid susceptibility of impression,\r\nwhich so frequently attends fever. Its use is contra-indicated in all\r\ncases where inflammatory action prevails, as in pulmonary affections,\r\nattended with an accelerated circulation and a dry hard cough.[592] It\r\nis employed by some of the oriental nations for the same purposes that\r\nwe take spirituous potations: by the Turks especially, to whom our more\r\ngenerous beverages are prohibited by religious prejudice, opium is\r\nsolicited to inspire courage, or to invigorate fortitude;—to soothe\r\nsorrow;—or to dissipate the remembrance of misfortune;—to awaken the\r\nfancy to more brilliant exertions; or to create that mild composure and\r\nserenity of feeling, which is desirable after the cares and solicitudes\r\nof an active, perplexing, and arduous scene: like spirituous liquors\r\namong other people, it is, in short, the support of the coward,—the\r\nsolace of the wretched,—and the daily source of intoxication to the\r\ndebauchee. Notwithstanding all this, spirit and opium are by no means\r\nparallel medicines; on the contrary, the latter substance offers the\r\nbest remedy for the _Mania a Potu_, and in cases of habitual drunkenness\r\nfrom alcohol, where our wish is to abstract the spirit, but are for\r\nobvious reasons unable so to do, we may frequently alternate its use\r\nwith that of opium, with considerable advantage. Many of the beneficial\r\neffects of this remedy are to be referred to its power of allaying\r\nirritability; Sir G. Blane has remarked, that in ill-conditioned ulcers\r\nin the West Indies, opium was found superior to all other internal\r\nmedicines for producing a disposition to heal. Under the free use of it,\r\nsuch ulcers would in place of a sanious discharge produce a healthy puss\r\nsucceeded by granulations and cicatrization. It appears to do this by\r\nsuspending irritation, and perhaps by promoting absorption.\r\n\r\nIn combination, the medical powers of opium are wonderfully extended, so\r\nthat there is scarcely a disease in which it may not, during some of its\r\nstages, be rendered useful. By diminishing the sensibility of the\r\nstomach and bowels, it becomes a valuable and efficacious _corrigent_ to\r\nmany important medicines, and thus frequently favours their absorption\r\nand introduction into the system, as for instance, in the exhibition of\r\nmercurial alteratives, (_Form. 141,_) and in certain diuretic\r\ncombinations, (_Form. 100, 106, 107, 110,_) in combination with\r\nantimonials, and with ipecacuan, its narcotic powers are obviated, and\r\nsudorific results are obtained. See _Pulv. Ipecac. co_. (_Form. 117,\r\n119, 124, 125, 127, 130._) FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In substance, or under\r\nthe form of tincture. When we wish to continue the operation of opium,\r\nand not to obtain its full effect at once, it may be advantageously\r\ncombined with some substance capable of retarding its solution in the\r\nstomach, as _gum resins_. See _Pilulæ_ and _Form. 10, 11, 12, 13_. A\r\nwatery infusion, made by infusing powdered opium in boiling water, will\r\noften operate without producing that distressing nausea and head-ache\r\nwhich so frequently follow the use of this substance. With respect,\r\nhowever, to the best modes of correcting the operation of this remedy,\r\nsee pages 160 and 162. Dr. Porter of Bristol has introduced to our\r\nnotice a solution of opium in citric acid; his formula[593] for its\r\npreparation is subjoined, because I am of opinion that it merits the\r\nattention of the practitioner; I have lately submitted it to the test of\r\nexperience, and it certainly possesses the merit of a powerful anodyne,\r\noperating with less disturbance than the more ordinary forms of this\r\nsubstance. I also take this opportunity of stating, that the\r\n_pyroligneous acid_ manufactured by Beaufoy was used as a menstruum, and\r\nthe effect of the solution was similar to that of Dr. Porter. When the\r\nstomach rejects altogether the internal exhibition of opium it may be\r\nsuccessfully applied along the spine, by friction, with the camphor\r\nliniment; a piece of solid opium introduced into the rectum, or\r\ndissolved in some appropriate solvent, and injected as an enema, affords\r\nalso considerable relief in spasmodic affections of the bowels, and in\r\npainful diseases of the prostate gland, or bladder, (_Form. 9._) When\r\nthus introduced into the rectum, it cannot undergo that change which the\r\ndigestive organs produce upon it, and consequently it is more uniform in\r\nits action than when presented to the stomach. Opium appears to be\r\nreadily absorbed into the system, when applied to the surfaces of sores;\r\nconsiderable relief has been thus afforded to irritable stumps, after\r\namputation, on which occasions, all the characteristic effects of opium\r\nhave been produced upon the system, such as costiveness, head-ache,\r\nnausea, &c. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Oxy-muriate of mercury_; _acetate\r\nof lead_; _alkalies_; _infusions of galls_, and _of yellow cinchona_.\r\nOrfila states that the decoction of _Coffee_ is less energetic as an\r\nantidote, than the infusion. When we intend the opium to act as a\r\nsedative, we should not combine it with stimulants. The Edinburgh\r\nCollege certainly erred in this respect, when they made pepper an\r\ningredient in their _Pilulæ Opiatæ_. In combination with vegetable\r\nacids, its narcotic powers are increased, in consequence of the\r\nformation of soluble salts with _morphia_.[594] When the opium however\r\nhas passed out of the primæ viæ, vinegar and acids are then the best\r\nremedies for counteracting its effects; (see _page 136_.) _Dose_, must\r\nbe varied according to the intention of the prescriber, the constitution\r\nof the patient, and the nature of the disease. A quarter of a grain,\r\nfrequently repeated, will keep up its exhilarating influence; (_Form.\r\n15_) from gr. j to ij acts as a narcotic; its power on the system soon\r\nbecomes weaker; and from habitual use it is so much impaired that very\r\nlarge doses are required to produce its usual effects. Russell observes\r\nthat the effects of opium on those addicted to its use, are at first\r\nobstinate costiveness, succeeded by diarrhœa and flatulence, with loss\r\nof appetite and a sottish appearance; the teeth decay, the memory fails,\r\nand the unhappy sufferer prematurely sinks into the grave.

The _Turkey\r\nOpium_, when good, is covered with leaves, and the reddish capsules of\r\nsome species of _rumex_; the inferior kinds have none of these capsules\r\nadhering to them. It is frequently adulterated with the extract of\r\nliquorice; it should be regarded as bad when it is very soft and\r\nfriable, of an intensely black colour, or mixed with many impurities,\r\nwhen it has a sweetish taste, or marks paper with a brown continuous\r\nstreak when drawn across it, or when it melts like wax, and makes a\r\nyellow solution in water. It frequently happens that in cutting a mass\r\nof opium, bullets and stones have been found imbedded in it, a fraud\r\nwhich is committed by the Turks, from which the retailer alone suffers.\r\nIt is also adulterated with the extract of poppy capsules, or of the\r\nwhole plant; with that of _chelidonium majus_, with gum arabic or\r\ntragacanth, with the oil of linseed, and even with the dung of oxen.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  OVUM.

The mercury in this preparation, is not, as it was formerly\r\nconsidered, in a state of mere mechanical division, but in that of a\r\nblack oxide, upon which its activity as a remedy undoubtedly depends;\r\nfor mercury in its metallic state is entirely inert with regard to the\r\nliving system. Various substances have at different times been\r\ntriturated with the mercury, for the purpose of _extinguishing_ or\r\n_killing_ it, by effecting the mechanical division and subsequent\r\noxidation of its particles, as manna, melasses, &c. _Conserve of Roses_\r\nis now generally preferred for this purpose, although Swediaur suspects\r\nthat the astringent principle of this conserve invalidates the effects\r\nof the mercury, “I have,” says he, “given these pills to several\r\npatients for a long time, without any symptom of salivation.” Mr.\r\nAbernethy observes in his surgical works, that the _Pilulæ Hydrargyri_\r\nare uncertain in their effects; and that some of the students at the\r\nhospital on examining them, and different parcels of the conserve of\r\nroses, say that the sulphuric acid may be discovered in each. Nor is it\r\nimprobable that in making the conserve for sale, some of this acid may\r\nbe added to brighten the colour; and if so, the mercurial pill which is\r\nmade from it may contain in varying proportions, some of that highly\r\ndeleterious compound, the _sub-sulphate of mercury_. When any of the\r\ngums are employed for _killing_ the metal, the pills soon become hard\r\nand brittle, and after some time the mercury is liable to run into its\r\nmetallic state. The pill-mass, when rendered thinner by the addition of\r\na little water, and extended on a piece of paper, ought not to exhibit\r\nany metallic globules; in this examination, however, we must be careful\r\nnot to be betrayed by the fallacious appearance which is frequently\r\npresented by small crystals of saccharine matter. The relative\r\nproportion of mercury contained in the mass can be ascertained only by\r\nits weight. The _blue pill_ is made at Apothecaries’ Hall by a very\r\ningenious machine actuated by steam, and which rubs as well as rolls the\r\nmaterials, and it is said the pill thus made is more active than that\r\nproduced in the ordinary way. MED. USES. It is by far the best form for\r\nthe internal exhibition of mercury; where it is intended to act upon the\r\nsystem as an alterative, it should be administered in doses of from grs.\r\niv to vj; if it occasion any action on the bowels, it may be conjoined\r\nwith opium; sometimes a few grains of rhubarb, exhibited every morning,\r\nwill impart such a tone to the intestines, as to enable them to resist\r\nthe mercurial irritation. In cases where the form of pill is\r\nobjectionable, it may be readily suspended by the aid of mucilage, in\r\nsome aqueous vehicle; when exhibited in doses of grs. x to ℈j, it acts\r\nas a mild but efficient purgative. _Form: 79, 106._ One grain of mercury\r\nis contained in three grains of the mass; the proportion of metal, or\r\noxide, in any other given quantity, is shewn at once by the Dynameter.\r\nFor the specific effects of mercury, see _Ung. Hydrarg_.\r\n\r\nPILULÆ HYDRARGYRI SUB-MURIATIS COMPOSITÆ. L.E.

L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                            _Black Pepper._\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. An oily matter, fecula, and extractive; the acrid\r\nprinciple of Pepper has been separated by Oersted in an alkaline form.\r\nThe following was the process by which it was procured. The pepper\r\nhaving been digested in alcohol, muriatic acid and afterwards water were\r\nadded to the tincture, by which the resin was precipitated, while a\r\n_muriate of Pipera_ remained in solution. The solution was then, after\r\nhaving been submitted to a certain evaporation, decomposed by pure\r\npotass, when a precipitation of _Pipera_ took place. This salifiable\r\nbase is nearly insoluble in cold, and only very slightly soluble in\r\nboiling water. It dissolves in alcohol, and the solution has a\r\ngreenish-yellow colour, which by the addition of nitric acid is rendered\r\ngreen. The capacity of the base for saturation appears very small.\r\nSOLUBILITY. The virtues of pepper are entirely extracted by æther and\r\nalcohol; and partially by water, 550 pints being required to extract all\r\nthe sapidity of ℔j of pepper. MED. USES. It appears to be a more general\r\nand permanent stimulus than other species of equal pungency on the\r\npalate; it may be combined with bitters, and exhibited in nausea,\r\ndyspepsia, retrocedent gout, or as a stimulant in paralysis; it is also\r\na valuable coadjutor to bark, in obstinate intermittents. An infusion\r\nmade with black pepper that has been toasted, is often prescribed by the\r\nnatives of India in cases of cholera morbus; and I have known it, says\r\nDr. Ainslie, put a stop to the vomiting when many other remedies had\r\nfailed.

L.E.D. (Pinus Sylvestris.) _Tar._\r\n\r\nThis fluid is formed from the decomposition of the resinous juice of the\r\npine, during the slow and smothered combustion of its branches, and as a\r\nsummary definition of the substance, that by Pliny cannot be surpassed,\r\n“_Pix nihil aliud quam combustæ resinæ fluxus._” _Lib. 23. c. 1._\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is found to consist of empyreumatic oil, resin,\r\nacetic acid, and some salts. SOLUBILITY. Water readily dissolves a\r\nportion of Tar, and forms a solution of the colour of Madeira wine, with\r\na sharp empyreumatic taste. MED. USES. Tar water, under the auspices of\r\nBishop Berkley, was formerly considered a remedy of extraordinary\r\npowers;[600] this opinion however has at length passed away, (_see page\r\n27_.) and Tar is now particularly indebted for a place in the Materia\r\nMedica, to an essay by Sir Alexander Crichton, entitled, “_An Account of\r\nsome Experiments made with the Vapour of boiling Tar,[601] in the cure\r\nof Pulmonary Consumption_.” At the request of Sir Alexander, I was\r\ninduced to make a trial of its effects, and I do not feel any hesitation\r\nin stating that the result has led me to believe that it may, in some\r\ncases, be attended with benefit. In the application of the remedy\r\nseveral precautions are necessary for its success. The Tar employed\r\nshould be that used in the cordage of ships; to every pound of which\r\nhalf an ounce of sub-carbonate of potass must be added, in order to\r\nneutralize the pyroligneous acid generally found mixed with the tar, the\r\npresence of which will necessarily excite coughing; the tar thus\r\nprepared is to be placed in a suitable vessel over a lamp, and to be\r\nkept _slowly_ boiling in the chamber during the night as well as the\r\nday; the vessel however ought to be cleaned and replenished every\r\ntwenty-four hours, otherwise the residuum may be burnt and decomposed, a\r\ncircumstance which will occasion increased cough and oppression on the\r\nchest. The ancients entertained a high opinion of the efficacy of Tar in\r\npulmonary diseases, when internally administered; supposing it to\r\npromote expectoration, relieve dyspnæa, and check spitting of blood;\r\nDioscorides particularly speaks of its utility in such cases; he also\r\nrecommends it to be applied to ulcers, which he says it fills up and\r\nheals, whether they be situated on the surface of the body, or in the\r\nears, throat, and other internal parts.

D.\r\n\r\n                         vulgo, Sugar of Lead.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, irregular masses resembling lumps of sugar, being an\r\naggregation of acicular four-sided prisms terminated by dihedral\r\nsummits, which are slightly efflorescent; by careful crystallization, it\r\nmay be obtained in quadrangular prisms. _Taste_, sweet and astringent.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Although it has been termed a _Super_-acetate, it\r\nappears to be a neutral salt, and that its power of reddening valuable\r\nblues is attributable to a partial decomposition; for when dissolved in\r\nwater containing the least portion of carbonic acid, a white carbonate\r\nof lead is precipitated, and a corresponding portion of acetic acid is\r\nnecessarily disengaged. The College have therefore now designated it as\r\nan _acetate_. According to the experiments of Berzelius, this salt, in\r\nits anhydrous state, consists of one proportional of acetic acid, and\r\none proportional of oxide of lead; so that the proportion of the\r\nmetallic base is one-third of that in the _sub_-acetate. SOLUBILITY. It\r\nis dissolved in 25 parts of water, hot or cold; it is also soluble in\r\nalcohol. When common water is employed the solution is quite turbid,\r\nunless a small proportion of acetic acid be previously added.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _The alkalies, alkaline earths and their\r\ncarbonates_; _most of the acids_; _alum_; _borax_; the _sulphates, and\r\nmuriates_; _soaps_; _all sulphurets_; _ammoniated, and tartarized iron_;\r\n_tartarized antimony_; _undistilled water_. The solution of _acetate of\r\nammonia_ decomposes that of this salt, in consequence of the carbonic\r\nacid which is generally diffused through it. It has lately been\r\ndiscovered that _Gallic acid_ and _Tannin_ are capable of combining with\r\nlead in solution, and of forming a perfectly insoluble substance, which\r\nfalls to the bottom of the vessel; hence all vegetable astringents must\r\nbe considered as incompatible with this medicine. On this account,\r\nliquors which have been kept in oak casks,[603] for a certain time, must\r\nbe freed from lead. This explains a fact, with respect to the effect of\r\nnew rum in the West Indies, of some importance. This spirit, when newly\r\ndistilled, is found to contain traces of lead, derived from the leaden\r\nrims of the coppers, and the leaden worm, used for its condensation;\r\nbut, by being kept about twelve months in oaken casks, it loses its\r\ndeleterious properties, and no longer exhibits any traces of this\r\nmetal.[604] Certain bodies appear likewise to be incompatible with the\r\ncompounds of lead, not from the _chemical_ changes they induce, but from\r\nthe contrary effects they produce upon the body; thus mercury appears to\r\ninvalidate their powers and to counteract their effects, as we may have\r\nobserved in treating saturnine cholic. I suspect also that antimony\r\noperates in the same manner; M. Merat relates the case of an apothecary\r\nwho was cured of a desperate saturnine cholic, after having taken, in\r\nthe course of eight days, eighty grains of tartarized antimony. MED.\r\nUSES. I feel no hesitation in pronouncing this salt of lead to be one of\r\nthe most valuable resources of physic; from the results of numerous\r\ncases, I state with confidence that it is more efficient in stopping\r\npulmonary and uterine hemorrhage, than any other known remedy—“_nil\r\nsimile, nec secundum_,”—and that its application is equally safe and\r\nmanageable; but it must not be combined with substances capable of\r\ndecomposing it, nor must it be simultaneously administered with the\r\nmedicines which are frequently prescribed in conjunction with it, as an\r\n_Infusion of Roses_, _Sulphate of Magnesia_, &c. Alum has also been in\r\nsome cases added to it, with the intention of increasing its\r\nastringency. It is evident that under such circumstances an insoluble\r\nand inert _Sulphate of Lead_ will be produced. The experiments of Orfila\r\nconfirm the truth of these views, and shew that such substances act as\r\ncounter-poisons for the salts of lead. According to my experience, those\r\nvegetable acids which decompose the acetate of lead, and form insoluble\r\nsalts with its base, are not _medically_ incompatible, when administered\r\nsimultaneously with it, although no scientific physician would prescribe\r\nsuch a mixture; this fact is shewn by the circumstance of potations,\r\ncontaining malic and tartaric[605] acids, not having been found to\r\ninvalidate the efficacy of this salt. Whether the stomach in the first\r\ninstance prevents the decomposition, and its necessary results, or\r\nallows the operation of the usual affinities, and then subsequently\r\ndecomposes the insoluble compound which results from them, by the\r\nabstraction and _digestion_ of its vegetable constituent, are questions\r\nfor future inquiry, when the laws of gastric chemistry shall be better\r\nunderstood, and more justly appreciated. I have also seen much benefit\r\naccrue from this medicine in protracted diarrhœa, when it has checked\r\nthe bowels more effectually even than opium. M. Gaspard has communicated\r\nto the public, through the medium of _Majendie’s Journal de\r\nPhysiologie_, (3 numéro Juillet, 1821,) a paper upon the operation of\r\n_Acetate of Lead_, entitled “_Experiences Physiologiques et Medicales\r\nsur L’Acetate de Plomb_,” in which he asserts that this metallic salt\r\ncannot be administered without risk in any dose, unless indeed it be\r\ngiven in vehicles which decompose it, and which, he adds, appears\r\ngenerally to have happened in the prescriptions of those who have given\r\nit extensively. He observes, that “it produces a slow and peculiar\r\ninflammation of the bowels, as well as of the lungs; and that it,\r\nmoreover, occasions _Cholica Pictonum_.” No one, I apprehend, will deny\r\nthe poisonous quality of acetate of lead, any more than that of arsenic;\r\nand yet both may, by proper management, be rendered therapeutical agents\r\nof value and safety. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In that of pill, guarded by\r\nopium; it will be prudent to recommend an abstinence from all potation,\r\nexcept that of cold water, or draughts, composed of diluted acetic acid,\r\nfor at least an hour after the ingestion of the pill.[606] DOSE, gr. ½\r\nto gr. j. _Form. 57._ OFFICINAL PREP. _Cerat.

SOLUBILITY. f℥j of water dissolves ʒvij; it is\r\nalso soluble in alcohol. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. This preparation,\r\nindependent of its impurities, is the _hydrated protoxide of potassium_,\r\nalthough in the state in which it is cast into sticks it generally\r\ncontains a little _Peroxide_,[608] and therefore evolves oxygen when\r\ndissolved in water. MED. USES. It is a most powerful caustic (_causticum\r\ncommune acerrimum_), and is frequently employed to establish an ulcer;\r\nor, instead of incision, to open a tumour. It has the advantage of other\r\ncaustics, from the circumstance of our being able to neutralize its\r\npowers by touching it with vinegar, and thus to arrest its progress in\r\nan instant; it is however more liable to produce a large eschar than\r\nnitrate of silver, in consequence of the chemical action of the alkali\r\nupon the skin. Within the last few years, surgeons have greatly\r\npreferred the use of this caustic to that of _nitrate of silver_, in\r\ncases of organic stricture of the urethra, as acting more powerfully,\r\nand yet occasioning less irritation than the latter substance; it is\r\nalso said that the part which it destroys is sooner detached and more\r\neasily eliminated. Its disposition, however, to extend its sphere of\r\naction has occasioned such a destruction of the membrane as to allow the\r\nurine to pass into the cellular substance, by which very serious effects\r\nhave been produced. For this reason there are cases in which the\r\n_nitrate of silver_ is still to be preferred. As an internal remedy it\r\nis only employed in solution.

It consists of one proportional\r\nof each of its components, or 48 potass and 50 acetic acid. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. It is decomposed by _tamarinds_ and _most sub-acid fruits_;\r\nby almost every acid, as well as every variety of neutral salt, whether\r\n_alkaline_, _acid_, or _metallic_. MED. USES. In small doses, diuretic;\r\nin larger ones, mildly cathartic. Dose, ℈j to ʒj to produce the former,\r\nʒij to ʒiij to excite the latter of these effects. FORMS OF EXHIBITION.\r\nOn account of its deliquescent property it is not admissible in powders\r\nor pills, but should be always exhibited in solution. (_Form. 108, 110,\r\n111._) In the former editions of this work, I introduced under the\r\npresent article, those views regarding the operation of saline bodies\r\nupon the kidneys, and their decomposition by the digestive organs, which\r\nI considered as capable of throwing some light upon the medicinal\r\noperation of these bodies. Having, however, in the present edition of my\r\nwork devoted a chapter to the consideration of Diuretics, I have\r\nnecessarily removed all my general observations upon this subject to\r\nthat part of the work; I therefore entreat the reader to refer to the\r\nfirst part, page 93. Alibert, in speaking of the diuretic virtues of\r\nthis salt, says that it is so well suited to the sensibility of the\r\nAbsorbents that its administration is frequently followed by very\r\nsalutary effects. (_Elémens de Thérapeutique_, _vol._ i. _p. 327_.)\r\n\r\nADULTERATIONS. _Tartrate of potass_ is discovered by adding a solution\r\nof tartaric acid, which will occasion with it a copious precipitate; the\r\n_sulphates_, by their forming with acetate of lead, or muriate of\r\nbaryta, precipitates insoluble in acetic or muriatic acid. The brown\r\ntinge which it frequently exhibits depends upon the same cause as that\r\nwhich usually imparts colour to the _Liquor. Ammon. Acet._ This salt is\r\nalso sometimes contaminated with _lead_, which arises from its having\r\nbeen prepared by decomposing the _acetate of lead_ by means of\r\n_carbonate of potass_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         POTASSÆ CARBONAS. L.E.\r\n\r\n                         _Carbonate of Potass._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, crystals which are four-sided prisms with dihedral\r\nsummits, permanent in the air; _Taste_, slightly alkaline without\r\nacrimony. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a _bi-carbonate_, consisting of\r\ntwo proportionals of carbonic acid and one proportional of potass; and\r\nin its crystalline form, it also contains water equal to one\r\nproportional. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in 4 parts of cold, and in ⅚ths\r\nof its weight of boiling water, in which it is partially decomposed,\r\ncarbonic acid being emitted during the solution; it is quite insoluble\r\nin alcohol. MED. USES. In cases where an alkali is indicated, this\r\npreparation offers an agreeable and efficient remedy; and experience has\r\nshewn that its additional proportion of carbonic acid does not in the\r\nleast invalidate its alkaline agency. In disordered states of the\r\ndigestive functions, alkalies frequently act with surprising effect; in\r\ncalculous affections their value has been already noticed (see _Liquor\r\nPotassæ_), and the stomach appears to bear the protracted exhibition of\r\nthe carbonate of potass or soda, with more temper than it does that of\r\nany other alkaline combination; and on account of the increased quantity\r\nof carbonic acid which this salt contains, it is preferable for\r\neffervescing draughts.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It consists of one proportional\r\nof nitric acid, and one proportional of potass. SOLUBILITY. It dissolves\r\nin seven parts of water at 60°, and in its own weight at 212°. Its\r\nsolubility is considerably increased by adding muriate of soda to the\r\nwater; its solution is attended with a great reduction of temperature;\r\nit is quite insoluble in alcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alum_;\r\n_sulphate of magnesia_; _sulphuric acid_; _the sulphates of zinc,\r\ncopper, and iron_; according to the usual laws of affinity, it should be\r\nalso decomposed by _sulphate of soda_; this however only takes place at\r\nthe temperature of 32°, and then but partially. MED. USES. Refrigerant,\r\nin which case the draught should be swallowed immediately after the\r\nsolution of the salt is complete, for if it be allowed to stand for some\r\ntime, its effect with regard to cooling is not nearly so evident (see\r\n_Form. 138, 144_); as a diuretic, its powers are too inconsiderable to\r\nbe employed, except in combination (_Form. 102, 109, 115, 170_); a\r\nsolution of ʒj to f℥vj of rose water forms a good detergent gargle, and\r\na small portion allowed to dissolve slowly in the mouth, will frequently\r\nremove an incipient inflammation of the tonsils: for its _modus\r\noperandi_ as a diuretic, see _Potassæ Acetas_. DOSE, grs. x to xv, as a\r\ndiuretic or refrigerant; grs. xxv to xl are aperient, and in large doses\r\nit excites vomiting, bloody stools, convulsions, and even death. The\r\nbest antidotes are opium and aromatics. IMPURITIES. As it occurs from\r\nthe hand of nature it is far from pure, and even by art it is freed with\r\ndifficulty from sea salt; the presence and quantity of which in any\r\nspecimen, may be learnt by adding nitrate of silver to its solution as\r\nlong as any precipitate is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       POTASSÆ SUB-CARBONAS.

This salt, although far from being pure, is sufficiently so\r\nfor every pharmaceutical purpose. It consists of one proportional of\r\nacid and one proportional of potass, with variable quantities of\r\n_sulphate of potass_, _muriate of potass_, _siliceous earth_, _alumina_,\r\ntogether with the _oxides of iron_, and _manganese_. SOLUBILITY. It is\r\ndissolved by twice its weight of water; the residue, if any, may be\r\nconsidered as impurity; it is insoluble in alcohol; with oils it\r\ncombines, and forms soaps. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. They are enumerated\r\nunder _Potassæ Carbonas_. MED. USES. Antacid, and diuretic, (_Form. 101,\r\n107, 129_), but it is far less pleasant than the carbonate; it is\r\nprincipally used for making saline draughts, see _Acid. Citric._ and\r\n_Form. 107_.

INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. It is partially decomposed by the\r\nnitric and muriatic acids, in which case, a portion of the base being\r\nsaturated, a corresponding portion of _bi-sulphate_ results; this fact\r\nillustrates a chemical law of some importance, viz. _that a substance\r\nless weakly attracted by another than a third, will sometimes\r\nprecipitate this third from its combination with the second, in cases\r\nwherein a_ super, _or_ sub-_salt is readily formed_.[611] The history of\r\ntartrate of potass will furnish farther illustrations.

MED. USES. On account of its\r\ninsolubility, it does not possess much activity as a purgative, but is\r\nsaid to be powerfully deobstruent; it should be exhibited in the form of\r\npowder, and in conjunction with rhubarb, or some other purgative\r\nmedicine.

I consider this substance as a mixture of Sulphate\r\nof Potass, with variable quantities of Sulphuret and Bi-Sulphuret of\r\nPotassium.[612] INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. It is instantly decomposed by\r\nwater, the oxygen of which forms Potass with the Potassium; while its\r\nhydrogen, combining with the sulphur, produces Sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\npart of which escapes, and another part forms, with the excess of\r\nSulphur, Bi-Sulphuretted hydrogen; this latter body uniting with the\r\nbase, produces what has been termed an _Hydroguretted Sulphuret_, but\r\nwhich might be more properly called an _Hydro-bi-Sulphuret_; upon adding\r\nan acid to the solution, a quantity of Sulphur is thrown down,\r\nSulphuretted hydrogen is evolved, and a salt of Potass remains in\r\nsolution. Metallic salts also decompose it, the metal falling down as a\r\nSulphuret, or Hydro-sulphuret. MEDICINAL USES. It presents us with a\r\nform in which sulphur is soluble in water; it is diaphoretic, and has\r\nbeen found advantageous in cutaneous affections, (_Form. 118_,) and in\r\narthritic and rheumatic complaints; while, from its known chemical\r\naction on metallic salts, it has been proposed as an antidote to such\r\npoisons. Its solution has been lately recommended as a lotion for the\r\nitch of infants, and in some cases it has been known to succeed after\r\nthe sulphur ointment had failed.[613]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      POTASSÆ SUPER-TARTRAS.

E.\r\n\r\n           _Super-Tartrate of Potass._ _Crystals of Tartar._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, small irregular brittle crystals, which when reduced\r\nto powder are termed _cream of tartar_. _Taste_, harsh and acid.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is a _bi-tartrate_, consisting of two\r\nproportionals of acid and one proportional of potass. _Solubility._ It\r\nrequires 120 parts of water at 60°, and 30 parts at 212°, for its\r\nsolution; it is slightly soluble in alcohol. The watery solution of this\r\nsalt was first observed by Berthollet to undergo a spontaneous\r\ndecomposition by keeping, during which a mucous matter is deposited, and\r\nthere remains a solution of carbonate of potass coloured with a little\r\noil. It has long been regarded a pharmaceutical desideratum to increase\r\nthe solubility of _cream of tartar_; Vogel discovered that it might be\r\naccomplished by combining it with boracic acid, and accordingly a\r\nformula has been introduced into the Codex Medicamentarius of Paris, for\r\npreparing a “_Tartras Acidulus Potassæ Solubilis, admixto Acido\r\nBoracico_.” The following is the process. Let thirty parts of boracic\r\nacid, and twenty parts of distilled water be heated together in a silver\r\ndish; as soon as this has been effected, add, in divided portions, 120\r\nparts of super-tartrate of potass, taking care to shake the mixture\r\ncontinually; the whole will soon liquefy, (“_mire liquescent_,”) and by\r\ncontinuing the heat, a pulverulent mass will result. As it is extremely\r\ndeliquescent it must be carefully preserved from the contact of the air;\r\nit dissolves in its own weight of water at 55°, and in half its weight\r\nat 212°. It is probable that the result is a new salt, in which the\r\nboracic and tartaric acids exist in combination,[614] but grant even\r\nthat the chemical identity of the super-tartrate is preserved inviolate\r\nin the compound, I would ask what medical advantage can possibly attend\r\nthe discovery? The peculiar value of cream of tartar depends doubtless\r\nupon its comparative insolubility, as I have already stated at page 173;\r\nmodify this, and you will instantly change the medicinal effects of the\r\nsalt; for like the neutral tartrate it will act upon the bowels, and\r\ntherefore cease to undergo those changes _in transitu_ which are\r\nessential to its characteristic operation. Alum also has been observed\r\nby Berthollet to have in some measure the same effect in increasing the\r\nsolubility of cream of tartar. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ and\r\n_alkaline earths_; the _mineral acids_, &c. MED. USES. In doses of ʒiv\r\nto ʒvj, it acts as a hydragogue cathartic, producing a considerable\r\ndischarge of serous fluid into the intestines; when however it is often\r\nrepeated, it is liable to occasion debility of the digestive organs, and\r\nconsequent emaciation: in smaller doses it acts as a diuretic. (_Form.\r\n112._) ʒj in oj of boiling water, flavoured with lemon peel and sugar,\r\nforms when cool an agreeable beverage well known by the name of\r\n_Imperial_. A _Cream of Tartar Whey_ may be made, by adding to a pint of\r\nmilk (when it begins to boil) ʒij of _Cream of Tartar_; the pan must\r\nthen be removed from the fire, the whole suffered to cool, and the\r\n_whey_ separated from the curd by straining; this whey, diluted with\r\nwarm water, furnishes an excellent drink in Dropsy. As it decomposes the\r\ncarbonate of potass, the union of these salts will afford a very\r\npleasant purgative draught. (_Form. 82._) OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Pulv.\r\nJalap. comp._ E. (=BM=) _Pulv.

It consists of one proportional of acid, and one\r\nproportional of base. SOLUBILITY. When in its crystalline form it is\r\nsoluble in its own weight of water, but in its ordinary granular form, 4\r\nparts are required for its solution; hence, compared with the insoluble\r\nsuper-tartrate, it has justly acquired the name of _soluble_ tartar;\r\nwhen long kept in solution, its acid is decomposed, and its alkali\r\nremains in a state of a _sub-carbonate_. It is also readily soluble in\r\nalcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Magnesia_, _baryta_, and _lime_;\r\n_acetate_ and _sub-acetate of lead_, and _nitrate of silver_ decompose\r\nit. All acids, even the _carbonic_,[616] and _acidulous salts_,\r\n_tamarinds_, and other _sub-acid vegetables_, by neutralizing a\r\nproportion of the base, convert it into the state of super-tartrate;\r\nthis fact offers another illustration of the chemical law of affinity,\r\nexplained under the head of _sulphate of potass_. The practitioner\r\nshould bear this in his recollection, for I have frequently seen a dose\r\nof _soluble tartar_ directed in the acidulated _infusion of roses_; the\r\nresult was of course very different from that which the author of the\r\nprescription intended to produce.

(_Phil. Trans._ lxxxi. 317.) It\r\nconsists of 43 parts of the phosphate of lime, mixed, or perhaps\r\nchemically combined, with 57 parts of oxide of antimony, of which a\r\nportion is vitrified; and it is probable, that the difference of the two\r\nremedies depends principally upon the quantity of oxide which is\r\nvitrified: the specification of the original medicine is worded with all\r\nthe ambiguity of an ancient oracle, and cannot be prepared by the\r\nprocess as it is described.[617] Experience has established the fact,\r\nthat _James’s Powder_ is less active than its imitation; it affects the\r\nbowels and stomach very slightly, and passes off more readily by\r\nperspiration; in general however the difference is so inconsiderable,\r\nthat we need not regret the want of the original receipt.[618] As it is\r\nquite insoluble in water, it should be given in powder, or made into\r\npills. It is diaphoretic, alterative, emetic, or purgative, according to\r\nthe extent of the dose and the state of the patient; in combination it\r\noffers several valuable resources to the intelligent practitioner.

It is antacid, astringent, and\r\ncarminative. _Dose_, grs. v to ℈j.\r\n\r\nPULVIS CRETÆ COMPOSITUS CUM OPIO. L. Compound powder of chalk\r\n_thirty-nine parts_, opium _one part_. _Form. 151._\r\n\r\nPulvis Ipecacuanhæ Compositus. L.E.D. Ipecacuan _one part_, opium (=H=)\r\n_one part_, sulphate of potass (=M=) _eight parts_. This combination has\r\nbeen long established in practice, as a valuable sudorific, under the\r\nname of _Dover’s Powder_. It affords one of the best examples of the\r\npower which one medicine possesses of so changing the action of another,\r\nas to produce a remedy of new properties; in this combination the opium\r\nis so modified, that it may be given with perfect safety and advantage\r\nin inflammatory affections accompanied with increased vascular action:\r\nit would seem that whilst the opium increases the force of the\r\ncirculation, the ipecacuan relaxes the exhalant vessels, and causes a\r\ncopious diaphoresis: the sulphate of potass is also an important\r\ningredient, for experience has fully proved that ipecacuan and opium, in\r\nthe same proportions, have not so powerful an effect without it; its\r\naction must be purely mechanical, dividing and mixing the active\r\nparticles more intimately, and it appears that the success of the remedy\r\ndepends very much upon its being finely powdered. _Dose_, grs. v. to ℈j,\r\ndiffused in gruel, or in the form of a bolus. (See _Form. 120, 121,\r\n122_.) The saline constituent in the original _Dover’s Powder_, was the\r\nresult of the deflagration of nitre, and was therefore deliquescent; its\r\ndose was as much as from 40 to 70 grains. In the _Codex_ of Paris, this\r\ncompound is directed to be prepared by melting together _four parts_ of\r\nsulphate of potass, with an equal proportion of nitrate of potass; to\r\nwhich when nearly cold is to be added, and well mixed by triture, _one\r\npart_ of pulverized extract of opium; the powders of ipecacuan and\r\nliquorice root, of each _one part_, are to be added last. It is evident\r\nthat the proportions of opium and ipecacuan in this combination, are\r\nless than those in ours, and yet it is said to be more powerfully\r\ndiaphoretic on account of the nitre. An arrangement, which is indebted\r\nfor its medicinal virtue to a similar mode of operation, is presented in\r\n_Form. 130_.\r\n\r\nPULVIS SCAMMONIÆ COMPOSITUS. L. Scammony and hard extract of jalap, of\r\neach _four parts_, ginger root (=E=) _one part_. The Edinburgh\r\npreparation of the same name differs very materially in composition, its\r\ningredients being scammony and cream of tartar in _equal parts_.\r\n\r\nPULVIS TRAGACANTHÆ COMPOSITUS. L. Powdered Tragacanth, acacia gum, and\r\nstarch, of each _one part_; refined sugar, _two parts_. From what has\r\nbeen already stated under the head of mucilage of tragacanth, it appears\r\nto be a superfluous, if not an injudicious demulcent; and since starch\r\nis insoluble in cold water, the object for introducing it is not very\r\nobvious. _Form. 120._\r\n\r\nPowders should be preserved in opaque green bottles, as they are\r\nmaterially affected by the action of light and air. Many of the compound\r\nones should be considered as extemporaneous, and ought to be prepared\r\nonly when they are required. The practitioner is also cautioned against\r\npurchasing any medicine in its powdered form, for so universal is the\r\nsystem of adulteration, that regular formulæ are observed in the\r\nwholesale houses for sophisticating powders, and Mr. Gray, in his\r\n“_Supplement to the Pharmacopœias_,” has given several specimens, under\r\nthe title of “_Pulveres Reducti_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                         PYRETHRI RADIX.

The dried root is inodorous, but upon being chewed, it soon\r\nproduces a pungent and peculiar sensation. SOLUBILITY. Alcohol, æther,\r\nand boiling water extract its virtues. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. _M.\r\nGautier_ has lately shewn that the peculiar pungency of the root depends\r\non a fixed oil, which resides in vesicles in the bark. MED. USES. As a\r\nsialagogue, especially in cases of tooth-ache, and in paralysis of the\r\ntongue and muscles of the throat. (_Form. 143._) It also constitutes the\r\nbasis of a very valuable gargle, in use at St. Bartholomew’s Hospital,\r\nfor relaxation of the uvula and soft palate, as well as in certain cases\r\nof deafness depending upon an enlarged state of the tonsils. It is made\r\nby boiling ℥ss of the bruised root in oj of distilled water, until the\r\nfluid is reduced to one half; to which, when strained and cold, fʒij of\r\n_Liquor Ammoniæ_ are to be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 PYROLA UMBELLATA.[619] _Ground Holly._\r\n\r\nAlthough this plant has not yet found its way into the materia medica of\r\nthe Pharmacopœia, its credited virtues entitle it to some notice in the\r\npresent work. It was first brought into repute in this country by Dr.\r\nSomerville (_Med: Chirug: Trans: Vol. 5_). It is bitter, and consists of\r\nResin, gum-resin, tannin, and bitter extractive. Alcohol and proof\r\nspirit are its best menstrua, but the watery infusion appears to contain\r\nall the virtues of the plant. MED. USES. It is said to be diuretic,\r\ntonic, and deobstruent; there is, however, no evidence to shew that it\r\nacts, specifically, on any other than the urinary organs. Dr. Ives, in\r\nthe American edition of the present work, says, that as a diuretic\r\nmedicine it has unquestionable merit, and that it will frequently\r\nmitigate symptoms of gravel, and strangury proceeding from other causes;\r\nhe does not, however, agree with Dr. Barton, in considering it\r\n_Antilithic_. He has also given it, alternately with the _Uva Ursi_, in\r\nhæmaturia; the effects of severe and long continued gonorrhœal\r\ninflammation, with the most obvious benefit, and he considers it very\r\nanalogous in its operation to the _Uva Ursi_. In some instances it has\r\nappeared to afford great relief in chronic cutaneous diseases. Further\r\nobservation is necessary to define the mode and extent of its medicinal\r\noperation, but there is no hazard in saying that it is a medicine\r\npossessing considerable activity. Dr. Barton observes that this plant,\r\nlike Uva Ursi, occasionally imparts a black tinge to the urine. DOSE ʒi\r\nto ʒij of the tincture; f℥ij to f℥iv of the infusion, prepared by\r\npouring a pint of boiling water upon ℥j of the stalks and leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n              QUASSIA. L.E.D. (Quassia Excelsa. _Lignum._)\r\n\r\n                               _Quassia._\r\n\r\nThis wood owes all its properties to a peculiar bitter principle, which\r\nhas been examined by Dr. Thomson and named _Quassin_; it is solid,\r\nslightly transparent, and of a yellowish-brown colour. (_See Infusum\r\nQuassiæ_.) It is said to owe its name to a West Indian negro, called\r\nQuassi, who first used it in fevers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         QUERCUS CORTEX. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                    (Quercus Pedunculata. _Cortex._)\r\n\r\n                              _Oak Bark._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, none; _taste_, rough and astringent. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. We are indebted to Sir H. Davy for a knowledge of this\r\nsubject; he found that an ounce of the inner cortical part of young oak\r\nbark afforded by lixivation 111 grains of solid matter, of which 77 were\r\n_tannin_; and the cellular integument, or middle-coloured part, only\r\nyielded 43 grains of solid matter, of which 19 were _tannin_; and the\r\nepidermis furnished scarcely any quantity of _tannin_ or extractive;\r\nhence the bark should be selected from the smaller branches of the oak\r\nwhere the epidermis is still thin. Experience has, moreover, shewn that\r\nthe quantity of _tannin_ varies considerably, not only according to the\r\nage and size of the trees, but according to the season at which they are\r\n_barked_; thus, the bark cut in spring contains, according to\r\n_Beguin_,[620] four times more of the astringent principle, than that\r\nwhich is obtained in winter. MED. USES. All its properties depend upon\r\nthe presence of _tannin_, it is therefore only valuable as a powerful\r\nastringent; it is accordingly employed to check inordinate discharges,\r\nsee _Decoctum Quercus_. Oak bark is sometimes administered in the form\r\nof powder, combined with ginger and other aromatics, and bitters, for\r\nthe cure of intermittents, and it has frequently succeeded, but see page\r\n167. Dose, ℈j to ʒss. In the form of poultice this powder is said to\r\nhave proved highly useful to gangrenous sores. Its inhalation has also\r\nbeen supposed to prove beneficial in consumption; a striking case is\r\nrelated by Dr. Eberle of a man who had laboured under the usual symptoms\r\nof confirmed Phthisis, and who, at the time he went to grind in a\r\nbark-mill, was extremely weak and emaciated; in a short time, however,\r\nthe cough, night sweats, and other hectic symptoms, began to abate\r\nsensibly, and in less than three months he was perfectly restored to\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   RHEI RADIX. L.E.D. _Rhubarb._[621]\r\n\r\nTwo varieties of this root are known in the shops, viz. _Turkey_ or\r\n_Russian_, and _East Indian_ or _Chinese_.\r\n\r\n\r\n               1. TURKEY or RUSSIAN. (_Rheum Palmatum._)\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, small round pieces, rather compact and heavy,\r\nperforated in the middle; _Colour_, lively yellow with streaks of white;\r\nit is easily pulverized, affording a powder of a bright buff-yellow\r\ncolour. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gum, resin, extractive, tannin, gallic\r\nacid, and a peculiar colouring matter, with traces of alumina and silex;\r\nthe white or flesh-coloured streaks pervading its substance, consist of\r\nsulphate and oxalate of lime: according to the experiments of Mr. John\r\nHenderson, there is besides a peculiar vegetable acid, to which he has\r\ngiven the name of _Rheumic_ acid, but M. de Lassaignes has\r\nsatisfactorily proved that this is no other than the oxalic acid: the\r\npurgative powers of the root appear to be intimately connected with its\r\nextractive and resinous elements, but the subject is still involved in\r\nconsiderable obscurity. SOLUBILITY. Water at 212° takes up 24 parts in\r\n60, see _Infusum Rhei:_ by decoction, its purgative qualities are lost,\r\nand it becomes more bitter and astringent; alcohol extracts 2·7 from 10\r\nparts, (see _Tinct. Rhei_.) MED. USES. In this substance, Nature\r\npresents us with a singular and most important combination of medicinal\r\npowers, that of an astringent, with a cathartic property; the former of\r\nwhich never opposes or interferes with the energy of the latter, since\r\nit only takes effect when the substance is administered in small doses,\r\nor if given in larger ones, not until it has ceased to operate as a\r\ncathartic; this latter circumstance renders it particularly eligible in\r\ncases of diarrhœa, as it evacuates the offending matter before it\r\noperates as an astringent upon the bowels. It seems to act more\r\nimmediately upon the stomach and small intestines, and therefore in\r\nrelaxed and debilitated states of these organs, it will prove an easy\r\nand valuable resource; it may, for such an object, be exhibited in\r\nconjunction with alkalies, bitters, and other tonics. Its cathartic\r\nproperty is most efficient when given in substance. It was formerly\r\nsupposed that by toasting rhubarb we increased its astringency, but this\r\nprocess merely diminishes its purgative force, so that a larger dose may\r\nbe taken. The colouring matter of rhubarb may be detected in the urine\r\nof persons to whom it has been exhibited; it does not however appear to\r\npossess any specific powers as a diuretic. DOSE, grs. vj to x as a\r\ntonic; ℈j to ʒss as a purgative; the operation of which is considerably\r\nquickened by the addition of neutral salts; the super-sulphate of potass\r\nforms also a very useful adjunct, and its acidulous taste completely\r\ncovers that of the rhubarb. _Form. 83, 85._ Its powder, when sprinkled\r\nupon ulcers, is found to promote their healthy granulation.

EAST INDIAN, OR CHINESE. (_Rheum Undulatum?_)[622]\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, long pieces, sometimes flat, as if they had been\r\ncompressed; they are heavier, harder, and more compact than those of the\r\npreceding species, and are seldom perforated with holes; _Odour_,\r\nstronger; _Taste_, more nauseous; white streaks less numerous, and they\r\nafford a powder of a redder shade than those of _Turkey_ rhubarb.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It differs from the _Turkey_ in containing less\r\ntannin and resin, and according to the experiments of Mr. A. T. Thomson,\r\nless oxalate of lime, in the ratio of 18 to 26. It contains however more\r\nextractive and gallic acid. SOLUBILITY. Water takes up one half of its\r\nweight, but the infusion, although more turbid, is not so deep coloured\r\nas that of Russian rhubarb; alcohol extracts 4 parts in 10. It habitudes\r\nwith acids, alkalies, and neutral salts, differ likewise from those of\r\nthe Russian variety, as Mr. A. T. Thomson has exhibited in a very\r\nsatisfactory manner. (_London Dispensatory, Edit. 3, p. 474._)\r\nADULTERATIONS. The inferior kinds of _Russian_, _East Indian_, and even\r\n_English_ rhubarb, are artfully dressed up and sold under the name of\r\nTurkey rhubarb. I am well informed that a number of persons in this\r\ntown, known in the trade by the name of _Russifiers_, gain a regular\r\nlivelihood by the art of dressing this article, by boring, rasping, and\r\nthen colouring the inferior kinds; for which they charge at the rate of\r\neighteen-pence per pound. The general indications of good rhubarb are,\r\nits whitish or clear yellow colour, and its possessing the other\r\ncharacteristic properties as above mentioned; it ought also to possess\r\nin an eminent degree the peculiar odour, for when this is dissipated,\r\nthe powers of the medicine are nearly destroyed. In the form of powder,\r\nrhubarb is always more or less mixed with foreign matter; the detection\r\nof which can be alone effected by a trial of its efficacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n            RICINI[623] OLEUM. L.E.D. (_Ricinus Communis._)\r\n\r\n                           _Castor[624] Oil._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a viscid and colourless, or pale straw-coloured oil;\r\nit is nearly inodorous, but on being swallowed, excites a slight\r\nsensation of acrimony in the throat. It has all the chemical habitudes\r\nof the other expressed oils, except those which relate to its solubility\r\nin alcoholic and ethereal menstrua. MED. USES. It is mildly cathartic,\r\nand is particularly eligible in cases where stimulating purgatives would\r\nprove hurtful, but in obstinate constipation, where copious evacuations\r\nare required, this oil cannot be trusted, it will insinuate itself\r\nthrough the intestinal canal, bringing with it a small portion of the\r\nmore fluid contents, but leaving behind it the collection of indurated\r\nfæces. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. The most efficacious mode of administering\r\nit is by floating it upon tincture of senna, or peppermint water, or\r\nsome other similar vehicle; it is also sometimes given with success in\r\ncoffee or mutton broth, or suspended in water by the intervention of\r\nmucilage, yelk of egg (_Form. 75_,) or by honey, which at the same time\r\ncontributes to its laxative operation: alkalies, although they form an\r\nemulsion with it, convert it into a saponaceous compound, and impair its\r\ncathartic force. DOSE, f℥ss to f℥iss. ADULTERATIONS. It is usually\r\nadulterated with olive oil or poppy oil, and when to a considerable\r\nextent, scammony is added to quicken its operation. There is however a\r\npeculiarity in castor oil which serves to distinguish it from every\r\nother fixed oil, viz. its great solubility in rectified spirit; for\r\ninstance, f℥iv of alcohol of ·820 will mix uniformly with any proportion\r\nof castor oil, whereas it will not dissolve more than fʒj of _Linseed\r\nOil_; and a still less proportion of the expressed oils of almonds and\r\nof olives; when the spirit is diluted, its action on all these oils is\r\nequally diminished, so that _common spirit of wine_ has but little power\r\neven over castor oil; but here chemistry again interposes its aid, for\r\nby the addition of camphor, in the proportion of one part to eight of\r\nspirit, spirit of ·840 is enabled to dissolve castor oil, whilst it has\r\nno influence upon the other fixed oils; castor oil is also soluble in\r\nany proportion, in sulphuric æther of the specific gravity ·7563, while\r\nfour fluid-ounces of the same liquid will only dissolve a fluid-ounce\r\nand a quarter of the expressed oil of _Almonds_; a fluid-ounce and a\r\nhalf of that of _Olives_; and two fluid-ounces and a half of _Linseed\r\noil_. Vogel introduced a composition as a substitute for this oil, which\r\nsome practitioners have greatly extolled; it consisted of nine grains of\r\nthe extract of Jalap, and three grains of Venetian soap, triturated in a\r\nmortar with an ounce and a half of Olive oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  SABINÆ FOLIA. L. (Juniperus Sabina.)\r\n\r\n                            _Savine Leaves._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, heavy and disagreeable; _Taste_, bitter, hot, and\r\nacrimonious. CHEM. COMP. Essential oil, which may be obtained by\r\ndistillation with water; fixed oil, bitter extractive, and resin.\r\nSOLUBILITY. Both water and alcohol extract its active principles. MED.\r\nUSES. It possesses highly stimulating properties, and has been used as a\r\ndiaphoretic, anthelmintic, and emmenagogue. Rave, a German writer of\r\ngreat respectability, speaks of its use in chronic rheumatism in the\r\nhighest terms; Alibert commends its anthelmintic powers, but its\r\nreputation has principally rested upon its generally acknowledged\r\ninfluence over the uterus. The testimony of Dr. Home of Edinburgh is\r\nstrong in favour of its emmenagogue powers, but the adverse opinion of\r\nDr. Cullen brought it into disrepute. It occasions a manifest flow of\r\nblood to the uterus, but this is probably sympathetically produced by\r\nits direct action on the large intestines; for if given in large doses\r\nit occasions great heat in the primæ viæ, hæmorrhage, and inflammation\r\nof the bowels. It is therefore inadmissible in all cases which are\r\nattended with fever, or much vascular action. When amenorrhœa depends\r\nupon a relaxed state of the general system, or on an inactive and torpid\r\ncondition of the uterine system, it may often be employed with\r\nadvantage. Wedekind, a German writer, extols it in the treatment of that\r\natonic or relaxed state of the uterus, attended with an unnatural\r\nsecretion and soft swelling of the uterus, which is sometimes met with\r\nin women who have suffered much from repeated childbearing, and which is\r\nso generally attended with a train of hysteric disturbances. Dr. Eberle\r\nsays that he has occasionally employed it in cases of Amenorrhœa, in\r\nfemales of a relaxed habit of body; and although sometimes without\r\nsuccess, he has had sufficient evidence of its powers to establish its\r\nclaim to attention. In several cases, similar to those above stated, I\r\nhave employed the Savin with much success, but I have found it very\r\nliable to disturb the stomach, and to produce head-ache. FORMS OF\r\nEXHIBITION. Some practitioners have recommended that of powder, but it\r\nis almost impossible to pulverize it without previously drying it at a\r\ntemperature which will dissipate the essential oil, upon which its\r\nactivity depends. The tincture affords a more convenient form, and a\r\ncompound tincture formerly occupied a place in the Pharmacopœia, but has\r\nbeen abandoned. A decoction of an ounce of the leaves to a pint of\r\nwater, with the addition of syrup, has been also recommended; an\r\ninfusion, however, would be preferable. DOSE, of the powdered leaves\r\nfrom grs. v to x; of the tincture fʒj; of the decoction f℥ss to f℥j. As\r\nan external local stimulant, or escharotic, the dried leaves in powder\r\nare applied to warts, flabby ulcers, and carious bones; and the\r\nexpressed juice diluted, or an infusion of the leaves, as a lotion to\r\ngangrenous sores, scabies, and _tinea capitis_; or mixed with lard and\r\nwax as an issue ointment. The German writers speak very highly of its\r\neffects as a poultice to old and obstinate sores. OFFICINAL PREP. _Oleum\r\nVolatile Juniperi Sabinæ_. E.D.

L.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Orfila have shewn that Savine exerts a local action,\r\nbut that its effects depend principally on its absorption; through which\r\nmedium it acts on the nervous system, the rectum, and the stomach. It\r\nstill enjoys amongst the vulgar the reputation of being capable of\r\nproducing absorption.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    SACCHARUM. L.E.D. _Sugar._[625]\r\n\r\nSugar, as a pharmaceutical agent, is employed for accelerating the\r\npulverization of various resinous substances, and when exhibited with\r\nthe most acrid of them, it prevents their adhesion to the coats of the\r\nintestines, by which they might irritate and inflame them; it is also\r\nextensively used on account of its power in preserving animal[626] and\r\nvegetable substances. (See _Conservæ_.) Milk boiled with fine sugar will\r\nkeep for a great length of time, and might be very conveniently employed\r\nduring a long voyage. Dr. Darwin also observes that fresh meat cut into\r\nthin slices, either raw or boiled, might be preserved in coarse sugar or\r\ntreacle, and would furnish a very salutary and nourishing diet to our\r\nsailors. Sugar exerts also some chemical affinities which are highly\r\ninteresting to the pharmaceutic chemist. Vogel has published a paper to\r\nshew, that when sugar is boiled with various metallic oxides, and with\r\ndifferent metalline salts, it has the property of decomposing them;\r\nsometimes reducing the oxide to the state of a metal, and at others\r\ndepriving the oxide only of one of the proportionals of oxygen; thus\r\n_sulphate of copper_ and _nitrate of mercury_ are precipitated in a\r\nmetallic form, whilst _peroxide of mercury_ and _acetate of copper_ are\r\nconverted into protoxides; _corrosive_ sublimate is changed into\r\n_calomel_, but _calomel_ is not susceptible of any further\r\ndecomposition. All those metallic salts which have the power of\r\ndecomposing water are not affected by sugar, as those of _iron_, _zinc_,\r\n_tin_, and _manganese_. It appears, moreover, that sugar has the\r\nproperty of rendering some of the Earths soluble in water. Sugar in\r\nwater, at the temperature of 50°, is capable of dissolving one half of\r\nits weight of lime; the solution thus produced is of a beautiful\r\nwhite-wine colour, and has the smell of fresh-slacked quick-lime. It is\r\nprecipitated from the solution by the _carbonic_, _citric_, _tartaric_,\r\n_sulphuric_, and _oxalic_ acids; and it is decomposed, by double\r\naffinity, by _caustic_ and _carbonated potass_ and _soda_, and by the\r\n_citrate_, _tartrate_, and _oxalate of potass_, &c. The union of sugar\r\nwith the alkalies has been long known, and in the decomposition of the\r\nsolution of lime in sugar by the salts above mentioned, the acid unites\r\nwith the lime, and the alkaline base forms a compound with the sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SAPO. L.E.D. _Soap._\r\n\r\n\r\n           I. Durus. (_Hispanicus._) _Hard_, or Spanish Soap.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Oil 60·94, soda 8·56, water 30·50; the water is\r\npartially dissipated by being kept, and the soap therefore becomes\r\nlighter. Muriate of Soda is also an essential ingredient[627] of _hard_\r\nsoap. SOLUBILITY. Water dissolves about one-third of its weight of\r\ngenuine soap, and forms a milky solution; alcohol also dissolves it, and\r\naffords a solution nearly transparent, although somewhat\r\ngelatinous.[628] INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. 1. All acids and acidulous\r\nsalts, which combine with the alkali, and develope the oil. 2. Earthy\r\nsalts, e. g. _Alum_; _muriate_ and _sulphate of lime_; _sulphate of\r\nmagnesia_. 3. Metallic salts. _Nitrate of silver_; _ammoniated copper_;\r\n_tincture of muriated iron_; _ammoniated iron_; _acetate_,\r\n_sub-muriate_, and _oxy-muriate of mercury_; _sub-acetate of lead_;[629]\r\n_tartarized iron_; _tartarized antimony_; _sulphate of zinc_, _copper\r\nand iron_. 4. All astringent vegetables. 5. Hard water. MEDICINAL USES.\r\nIn large doses it is purgative; in smaller ones, it is decomposed _in\r\ntransitu_, and its alkali is carried to the kidneys; in this way it may\r\nact as a lithonthriptic; or it may produce its effects by correcting any\r\nacidity which may prevail in the _primæ viæ_, for the weakest acid is\r\ncapable of decomposing soap, and of uniting with its alkaline base; a\r\nsolution of soap in lime water was long regarded as one of the strongest\r\nsolvents of urinary calculi that could be administered with safety, but\r\nthe result of such a mixture is an insoluble soap of lime, and a\r\nsolution of soda; in habitual constipation, and in biliary obstructions,\r\nit is frequently prescribed in conjunction with rhubarb, or some bitter;\r\nin which cases it can only act as a laxative, or as a chemical agent, in\r\nincreasing the solubility of the substance with which it is united.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Resin is\r\nthe principal constituent; 16 parts of good _Aleppo_ Scammony yield 11\r\nparts of resin, and 3½ of watery extract. That from _Smyrna_ contains\r\nnot more than half the quantity of resin, but more extractive, and gum.\r\nSOLUBILITY. Water, by trituration, takes up one-fourth, alcohol\r\ntwo-thirds, and proof spirit dissolves all, except the impurities.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. Neither acids, metallic salts, nor ammonia,\r\nproduce any change in its solutions, but the fixed alkalies occasion\r\nyellow precipitates; and yet they do not appear to be _medicinally_\r\nincompatible with it; thus Gaubius, “_Scammoneum acidi commixtio[631]\r\nreddit inertius; alcali fixum, contra, adjuvat_.” The mineral acids\r\nappear to destroy a part of the substance, without in the least altering\r\nthe rest. The discrepancy which exists in authors respecting the power\r\nof this drug, seems to have arisen from its operation being liable to\r\nuncertainty, in consequence of peculiar states of the alimentary canal;\r\nfor instance, where the intestines are lined with an excess of mucus, it\r\npasses through without producing any action, but where the natural mucus\r\nis deficient, a small dose of scammony may irritate and even inflame the\r\nbowels. In this latter case, my practice has been to administer the\r\npurgative in a mucilaginous draught, or emulsion. MED. USES. It is an\r\nefficacious and powerful cathartic, very eligible in worm cases, and in\r\nthe disordered state of the bowels which so commonly occurs in children.\r\nDOSE, grs. iij to xv, in the form of powders triturated with sulphate of\r\npotass, sugar, or almonds; when given alone, it is apt to irritate the\r\nfauces; it may be also administered as a solution, effected by\r\ntriturating it with a strong decoction of liquorice, and straining.\r\n(_Form. 78, 83._) OFFICINAL PREPARATIONS. _Confect: Scammon:_ L.D.\r\n_Pulv: Scammon: co._ L.E. _Extract: Colocynth: co._ L.

Two kinds of Scammony are\r\nimported into this country, that from _Aleppo_, which is the best; and\r\nthat from _Smyrna_, which is more compact and ponderous, but less pure:\r\nit is commonly mixed with the expressed juice of the _cynanchum\r\nmonspeliacum_; it is also sophisticated with _flour_, _sand_, and\r\n_ashes_; their presence may be detected by dissolving the sample in\r\nproof spirit, when the impurities will sink, and remain undissolved;\r\ncarbonate of lime is moreover frequently added to Scammony, in which\r\ncase the sample will effervesce in acids: there is however a compound\r\nbearing the name of Scammony, to be met with in the market, which is\r\naltogether factitious, consisting of jalap, senna, manna, gamboge, and\r\nivory black. Good Scammony ought to be friable, and when wetted with the\r\nfinger, it should _lactify_, or become milky: and the powder should\r\nmanifest its characteristic odour, which has been compared to that of\r\nold ewe milk cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\n                SCILLÆ RADIX. L.E.D.

By drying, the bulb\r\nloses about four-fifths of its weight, and with very little diminution\r\nof its powers, provided that too great a heat has not been applied.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. According to Vogel, gum 6—tannin 24—sugar 6—bitter\r\nprinciple (_Scillitin_, which is white, transparent, and breaks with a\r\nresinous fracture) 35—woody fibre 30. SOLUBILITY. Squill gives out its\r\nvirtues so perfectly to any of the ordinary menstrua, as to render the\r\nform of its exhibition, in that respect, a matter of indifference.\r\nINCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ diminish their acrimony and\r\nbitterness, and are probably _medicinally_ inconsistent with their\r\ndiuretic qualities, but farther experiments are required to decide this\r\nquestion: _vegetable acids_ produce no effect upon their sensible\r\nqualities, but are said to increase their expectorant power. MED. USES.\r\nAccording to the dose, and circumstances under which it is administered,\r\nit proves expectorant, diuretic, emetic, or purgative; as an\r\nexpectorant, it can never be employed where pulmonary inflammation\r\nexists, for in such cases, instead of promoting, it will check any\r\nexcretion from the lungs; its combination with a diaphoretic will\r\nfrequently increase its powers, and generally be a measure of judicious\r\ncaution. See _Form, 133, 134, 135, 139_. For the philosophy of its\r\naction, the reader must refer to the classification of Expectorants,\r\npage 102. As a diuretic, it seems to act by absorption, and we\r\naccordingly find, on the authority of Dr. Cullen, that _when the squill\r\noperates strongly on the stomach and intestines, its diuretic effects\r\nare less likely to happen_; he therefore found that by accompanying it\r\nwith an opiate, (_Form. 100)_ the emetic and purgative operation may be\r\navoided, and the squill be thereby carried more entirely to the kidneys.\r\nExperience, moreover, has taught us the value of combining this medicine\r\nwith some mercurial preparation, by which its diuretic powers are very\r\nconsiderably augmented; and it has been farther stated, that such a\r\ncombination is particularly efficacious in Hydrothorax, especially when\r\nit produces inflammation of the gums, and of the glands about the\r\nthroat, by which action it is supposed to cause a derivation from the\r\nexhalants of the pleura, and thereby to diminish the dropsical effusion.\r\n(_Form: 102, 103, 106, 107, 109, 112, 115_,) but we must take care that\r\nthe remedy does not occasion purging. In the exhibition of squill, it\r\nhas been often delivered as a rule, to give it to the extent necessary\r\nto induce nausea, as affording a test of the medicine being in a state\r\nof activity; such a state of the system, moreover, may assist the\r\nabsorption of the remedy. Dr. Home, in opposition to the opinion of\r\nCullen, maintained that the powers of Squill as a diuretic, were\r\nincreased by combining it with bodies capable of promoting its full\r\nemetic operation: after what has been observed, however, it is\r\nunnecessary to dwell upon the mischievious tendency of such a practice.\r\nBy referring to our tabular arrangement of Diuretics, page 102, the\r\nreader will find that I consider its action upon the urinary organs to\r\ndepend upon its bitter principle (_Scillitin_) being developed, and\r\ncarried, by the medium of the circulation, to the secreting vessels of\r\nthe kidneys, which it thus stimulates by actual contact. As an emetic,\r\nit has been advised in solution, in cases of hooping cough, but its\r\nextreme uncertainty renders it unfit for exhibition, unless as an\r\nadjunct to emetic combinations, as in _Form: 65_. _Plenck_ makes mention\r\nof a child which had convulsions in consequence of taking some Squill.\r\nDOSE.

The most probable is that it is a parasitic fungus, attached to\r\nseveral species of the gramina, but more especially to the rye. It is\r\ngenerally found most abundant in moist situations and in wet seasons.\r\nIts taste, at first scarcely perceptible, becomes shortly disagreeable\r\nand sub-acrid. By the analysis of Vauquelin, the ergot has been\r\nascertained to contain, 1. A fawn-yellow colouring matter, soluble in\r\nalcohol, and having a taste resembling that of fish oil. 2. A white oily\r\nmatter, of a sweetish taste, which appears to be very abundant. 3. A\r\nviolet colouring principle, of the same shade as that of orchil, but\r\ndiffering from it by its solubility in alcohol, and which can be readily\r\nfixed on aluminated wool and silk. 4. A free acid, supposed to be partly\r\nphosphoric. 5. A very abundant vegeto-animal substance, much disposed to\r\nputrefaction, and which furnishes a considerable quantity of thick oil\r\nand of ammonia by distillation. 6. A small quantity of free ammonia,\r\nwhich can be obtained at the temperature of boiling water. As a\r\nmedicinal substance, ergot exerts a specific effect upon the uterus, and\r\nis very generally used in this country for the purpose of facilitating\r\nthe process of parturition. From the powerful effects produced by the\r\nergot, it is obvious that it should be used with much caution. Dr.\r\nStearns, to whom the profession is indebted for the first introduction\r\nof this article into practice, and who must be considered as our highest\r\nauthority on this subject, has laid down the following rules by which\r\nits administration should be regulated: 1. It should never be\r\nadministered where nature is competent to a safe delivery. 2. It should\r\nnever be administered until the regular pains have ceased, or are\r\nineffectual, and there is danger to be apprehended from delay. 3. It\r\nshould never be administered until the rigidity of the os tincæ has\r\nsubsided, and a perfect relaxation has been induced. 4. It should never\r\nbe administered in the incipient stages of labour, nor until the os\r\ntincæ is dilated to the size of a dollar. 5. It should never be\r\nadministered in any case of preternatural presentation that will require\r\nthe fœtus to be turned. 6. It should never be administered during the\r\ncontinuance of one labour, in larger quantities than thirty grains by\r\ndecoction in half a pint of water. A table spoonful of this given every\r\nten minutes, generally succeeds better than a larger dose. While this\r\nquantity produces its most favourable effects upon the uterus, it does\r\nnot affect the stomach with nausea or vomiting, which sometimes\r\ninterrupts its successful operation.\r\n\r\nThe ergot is indicated, and may be administered, 1. When, in lingering\r\nlabours, the child has descended into the pelvis, the parts dilated and\r\nrelaxed, the pains having ceased, or being too ineffectual to advance\r\nthe labour, there is danger to be apprehended from delay, by exhaustion\r\nof strength and vital energy, from hemorrhage or other alarming\r\nsymptoms. 2. When the pains are transferred from the uterus to other\r\nparts of the body, or to the whole muscular system, producing general\r\npuerperal convulsions. After premising copious bleeding, the ergot\r\nconcentrates all these misplaced labour-pains upon the uterus, which it\r\nsoon restores to its appropriate action, and the convulsions immediately\r\ncease. 3. When in the early stages of pregnancy, abortion becomes\r\ninevitable, accompanied with profuse hemorrhage and feeble uterine\r\ncontractions. 4. When the placenta as retained from a deficiency of\r\ncontractions. 5. In patients liable to hemorrhage immediately after\r\ndelivery. In such cases the ergot may be given as a preventive, a few\r\nminutes before the termination of the labour. 6. When the hemorrhage or\r\nlochial discharges are too profuse immediately after delivery, and the\r\nuterus continues dilated and relaxed without any ability to contract.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SENEGÆ RADIX.

Extractive, resin,\r\nmucilage, and saline matter; it contains within itself a purgative\r\nprinciple and a bitter element; and although the latter is _per se_\r\ninert, yet in combination, its presence aids and exalts the efficacy of\r\nthe former. M. M. Lassaigne and Fenuelle have lately announced the fact\r\nof their having procured the purgative principle of Senna in a separate\r\nform, and to which they have given the name of _Cathartine_. It is said\r\nto be an uncrystallizable substance, of a reddish-yellow colour, and of\r\na particular smell, and bitter nauseous taste, soluble in alcohol and\r\nwater, in all proportions; but farther experiments are required upon\r\nthis subject. SOLUBILITY. Both water and spirit extract the virtues of\r\nSenna; to water and proof spirit the leaves communicate a brownish\r\ncolour, more or less deep according to the proportions employed; to\r\nrectified spirit they impart a fine green colour. The powdered leaves of\r\nsenna are very apt to undergo a change by exposure to a humid\r\natmosphere, becoming covered with a kind of mouldiness which contains a\r\nsmall proportion of potass.

The leaves of Senna are imported from\r\nAlexandria in a state of adulteration, being mixed by the merchants of\r\nCairo with the leaves of _Cynanchum Oleafolium_, (Arguel) and with those\r\nof _Colutea Arborescens_; the former are distinguished by their greater\r\nlength as well as by their structure, which differs from the leaves of\r\nSenna in having a straight side, and being regular at their base, and in\r\nnot displaying any lateral nerves on the under disk; the latter are so\r\ndifferent from Senna leaves, that there is no difficulty in at once\r\nrecognising them. The _Tripoli Senna_ contains a much larger proportion\r\nof _Cynanchum_, and of the other adulterations; as a general rule, those\r\nleaves which appear bright, fresh, free from stalks and spots, that are\r\nwell and strongly scented, smooth and soft to the touch, thoroughly dry,\r\nsharp pointed, bitterish, and somewhat nauseous, are to be preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        SERPENTARIÆ RADIX.

CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Resin and an essential oil constitute\r\nits active ingredients. SOLUBILITY. Its virtues are extracted by water,\r\nas well as by alcohol. The tincture has a bright green colour, which is\r\nrendered turbid by water. It neither affects Tannin nor Gelatine, nor\r\ndoes it precipitate the salts of iron. MEDICINAL USES. It has been\r\nregarded as serviceable in cases that required the combined powers of a\r\ndiaphoretic and tonic, as in some of the stages of typhus and other low\r\nfevers; it has also been found to exalt the febrifuge powers of the bark\r\nin cases of protracted intermittents. It is likewise valued on account\r\nof its efficacy in certain cases of dyspepsia, attended with a dry skin.\r\nIts stimulating properties will of course prevent its application in the\r\ninflammatory diathesis.

MEDICINAL\r\nUSES. It has been considered tonic, and has been used with advantage as\r\nsuch in intermittent fevers. To _Dr. Wright_ we are principally indebted\r\nfor a knowledge of its powers. It has been much commended in the latter\r\nstages of dysentery, after the fever has abated, and the tenesmus\r\ncontinues with a sinking pulse.

SOLUBILITY.\r\nUnbruised mustard seeds, when macerated in boiling water, yield only an\r\ninsipid mucilage, which like that of linseed, resides in the skin; but\r\nwhen bruised, water takes up all the active matter, although it is\r\nscarcely imparted to alcohol. MEDICINAL USES. It is a beneficial\r\nstimulant in dyspepsia; chlorosis, and paralysis; for which purpose, a\r\ntea spoonful of the bruised seeds may be administered; or a _whey_ may\r\nbe made, by boiling a table spoonful of the bruised seeds in oj of milk,\r\nand straining; of which a fourth part may be taken three times a day,\r\n(see _Form._ 46.) or it may be given in infusion. (_Form. 45._) The\r\nfarina made into a paste with crumbs of bread and vinegar, affords one\r\nof the most powerful external stimulants which we can apply, and is\r\ntechnically termed a _Sinapism_; it produces intense pain, and excites\r\nan inflammation entering much more into the true skin than that which is\r\nexcited by the Lyttæ; it is therefore worthy attention in all internal\r\ninflammations where bleeding is limited: if necessary it may be\r\nquickened by the addition of oil of turpentine.

L.E. _Carbonate of Soda._\r\n\r\nThis salt, when properly prepared, is a _bi-carbonate_, but so\r\ndelicately are the affinities of its constituent parts balanced, that\r\nthe application of a very moderate temperature is sufficient to subvert\r\nthem, and to occasion partial decomposition. Mr. Phillips states that\r\nalthough he has seen what he believes to be real bi-carbonate in the\r\nstate of the moist crystals, yet he has never met with any that was dry\r\nwhich had not lost one-fourth of its carbonic acid by exposure to heat;\r\nit is then a white gritty powder, less soluble in water than the\r\nsub-carbonate, like which it possesses an alkaline taste, and turns\r\nvegetable yellows brown, but both in a less degree. This salt, which is\r\ngenerally sold, as the carbonate of the pharmacopœia, and the\r\nbi-carbonate of chemists, Mr. Phillips considers as a compound of an\r\natom of carbonate, (_sub-carbonate_) and an atom of bi-carbonate,\r\ncombined with four atoms of water. It is therefore, according to the\r\nphraseology of some chemists, a _Sesqui-carbonate_,[637] as being equal\r\nto an atom and a half of acid and one atom of base. The chemical\r\nhabitudes of this salt, as connected with its medicinal applications,\r\nare similar to those of the _carbonate of potass_, which see. MED. USES.\r\nAs it is less nauseous, so is it more eligible than the _sub_-carbonate\r\nof the same alkali; in other respects its effects are the same; _vide\r\nSodæ Sub-carbonas_. DOSE, grs. x to ʒss.[638] ADULTERATIONS. If the\r\nsalt, after super-saturation with dilute nitric acid, give a precipitate\r\nwith nitrate of baryta, it contains some sulphuric salt; and if with\r\nnitrate of silver, we may infer the presence of a muriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           SODÆ MURIAS.

D.\r\n\r\n                   _Muriate of Soda._ _Common Salt._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, that of regular cubes, which do not deliquesce unless\r\ncontaminated with muriate of magnesia.[639] CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It\r\nconsists, according to Berzelius, of 46·55 of muriatic acid, and 53·45\r\nof soda; according to the new theory, however, this salt must be\r\nconsidered as a true _muriate of soda_, only while it remains in aqueous\r\nsolution; for when it is reduced to dryness, the muriatic acid and the\r\nsoda become both decomposed, and the hydrogen of the former uniting with\r\nthe oxygen of the latter, they pass off in the form of water, while the\r\nchlorine of the muriatic acid unites with the metallic base of the soda,\r\nto form _chloride of sodium_, which consists of an atom of each\r\nconstituent. It is perhaps difficult to believe that the same salt\r\nshould be chloride of sodium in the hand, and muriate of soda in the\r\nmouth! but it is not the less true, nor is it more incredible than the\r\nchange which Sulphuret of potass undergoes by solution, the\r\ndecomposition of which is rendered evident to the senses by the evolved\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen. Late researches have also detected both in _rock_\r\nand in other salt, the presence of _muriate of potass_, and _muriate of\r\nmagnesia_.[640] SOLUBILITY. It is equally soluble in cold and in hot\r\nwater, one part of the salt requiring rather more than 2½ parts. MED.\r\nUSES. The effects of salt upon the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are\r\nstriking and important,[641] and have furnished objects of the most\r\ninteresting enquiry to the physiologist, the chemist, the physician, and\r\nthe agriculturist; it appears to be a natural stimulant to the digestive\r\norgans; and that animals are instinctively led to immense distances in\r\npursuit of it; for proof of this fact the reader is referred to “_Parkes\r\non the repeal of the Salt Laws_,” and to an interesting work by my late\r\nlamented friend, Sir Thomas Bernard, entitled, “_Case of the Salt\r\nDuties, with Proofs and Illustrations_.”[642] Salt, when taken in\r\nmoderate quantities, promotes,[643] while in excessive ones, it prevents\r\ndigestion; it is therefore tonic and anthelmintic, correcting that\r\ndisordered state of the bowels which favours the propagation of worms.\r\nIn Ireland, where, from the bad quality of the food, the lower classes\r\nare greatly infested with worms,[644] a draught of salt and water is a\r\npopular and efficacious anthelmintic. _Form: 162_, is a prescription by\r\nRush, who says that in this manner he has administered many pounds of\r\ncommon salt with great success in worm cases. In the first volume of the\r\nMedical Transactions we shall find an interesting account of a cure of\r\nthis disease by salt, after the failure of other remedies; I beg also to\r\nrefer the practitioner to another case illustrative of its anthelmintic\r\npowers, published by Mr. Marshall, (_London Medical and Physical\r\nJournal_, vol. xxxix. No. 231,) which is that of a lady who had a\r\nnatural antipathy to salt, and was in consequence most dreadfully\r\ninfested with worms during the whole of her life. In very large doses\r\n_Salt_ proves purgative; it is also absorbed, and carried to the\r\nkidneys, but it undergoes no decomposition _in transitu_, nor does it\r\nappear to possess any considerable powers as a diuretic; its solution in\r\ntepid water, in the proportion of ℥ss-℥j in oj of water, forms the\r\ncommon domestic enema.

CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Soda 29·5—carbonic acid 20·7. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in\r\ntwo parts of water at 60°, and in considerably less than its weight of\r\nboiling water; it is insoluble in alcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES are\r\nenumerated under _Potassæ Carbonas_. MED. USES, are similar to those of\r\nthe sub-carbonate of potass, but it is preferable to it for internal\r\nuse, as being more mild and less nauseous; and moreover Fourcroy states\r\nit as his opinion that soda is more eligible for medicinal purposes than\r\npotass, on account of its analogy with animal substances, which always\r\ncontain it, while on the contrary, no portion of potass is found in\r\nthem. Sir Gilbert Blane assumes an opposite opinion, and observes that,\r\nas far as he can judge of the comparative powers of the two fixed\r\nalkalies, he should greatly prefer Potass to Soda, as a remedy for\r\ngravel, one reason of which he thinks may be found in the fact that the\r\nSoda is an element of the animal fluids, since it enters largely into\r\nthe composition of bile, so that it is more likely to be arrested in the\r\ncourse of the circulation and diverted from the urinary organs. A\r\ngentleman, says Sir Gilbert, who was subject to frequent fits of gravel,\r\nand in the habit of making experiments on the small concretions which he\r\npassed, found that Soda dissolved them, but that Potass did not;\r\nnevertheless he experienced sensible relief, and even temporary cure,\r\nfrom the internal use of the latter alkali, but no benefit from the\r\nformer. Are then the absorbents more disposed to take up soda than\r\npotass? The results of experience do not appear to sanction such a\r\nconclusion. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It may be administered in solution, in\r\nan electuary, or in pills; when exhibited in the latter form, it must be\r\npreviously deprived of its water of crystallization, (_Sodæ Sub-carbonas\r\nexsiccata_.

In an effloresced state it is just equal\r\nin efficacy to double the weight of that which is in a crystalline form.\r\nIt is rendered more active by being combined with other purgative salts,\r\nespecially with sulphate of magnesia, and the compound is more soluble\r\nand less nauseous; (_Form. 69, 72_.) A portion of triple salt, a\r\n_magnesio-sulphate of soda_, probably results from the combination, a\r\nsalt which may be frequently detected in parcels of sulphate of\r\nmagnesia, and may be known by its crystals, which are regular rhomboids;\r\nit is also contained, according to Dr. Murray, in the brine or _mother\r\nliquor_ of sea-water; and it constitutes the whole of that salt which\r\nwas formerly sold under the name of “_Lymington Glauber’s Salts_”.[645]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       SPARTIUM.

I have frequently exhibited\r\nthem in the Westminster Hospital, with very great success in the form of\r\ndecoction. By referring to my classification of diuretics, page 93, it\r\nwill be seen that the _Broom_ is placed under the second division of the\r\nfirst class; for analogy sanctions the theory, that the bitter element\r\nis separated by the powers of digestion, and carried to the kidneys by\r\nthe medium of the circulation. (See _Form. 113_.) The ashes of this\r\nplant were extolled by Sydenham as a powerful diuretic, but the chemist\r\nhas shewn that it is merely a fixed alkaline salt.

It has lately been ascertained by Mr. Ritchie of Perth, that “_the\r\ndegree of cold induced by the evaporation of spirit of different degrees\r\nof strength are proportional to the strength of these spirits, reckoning\r\nfrom the degrees of cold induced by the evaporation of water_.” The\r\napplication of this theorem will enable us to ascertain the strength of\r\na spirit by the “DIFFERENTIAL THERMOMETER” of Leslie.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPIRITUS TENUIOR. L.\r\n\r\n                          ALCOHOL DILUTUM. E.\r\n\r\n                      SPIRITUS VINOSUS TENUIOR. D.\r\n\r\n                       _Weaker or Proof Spirit._\r\n\r\nThis is rectified spirit diluted with a certain proportion of water, and\r\nit is to be regretted that the quantity ordered for this purpose, should\r\nvary in the different Pharmacopœias; thus, according to the London and\r\nDublin Colleges, its specific gravity is ·930, while the College of\r\nEdinburgh directs it to be of ·935. The former consists of 44 per cent.\r\nof pure alcohol, and may be formed by mixing _four_ parts, by measure,\r\nof rectified spirit, with _three_ of water; the latter contains only 42\r\n_per cent._ of pure alcohol, and may be made by adding together _equal\r\nparts_ of rectified spirit and distilled water. Alcohol in this state of\r\ndilution, is better adapted for taking up the principles of vegetables\r\nthan rectified spirit; indeed, diluted alcohol acts upon bodies as a\r\nchemical compound, and will dissolve what neither the same proportion of\r\nwater nor of alcohol would, if separately applied; we perceive therefore\r\nthe importance of ensuring uniformity of strength in our spirits. (See\r\n_Tincturæ_.) It is necessary to remark that almost all the spirit sold\r\nunder the name of “_Proof Spirit_,” is contaminated with empyreumatic\r\noil, and is unfit for the purposes of pharmacy; it ought therefore to be\r\nextemporaneously prepared by mixing together rectified spirit and water,\r\nin the proportions above stated. This however is rarely done, except the\r\nliquors are intended for the toilet, and hence it has been observed,\r\nthat the cordials of the apothecary are generally less grateful than\r\nthose of the distiller, the latter being extremely curious in rectifying\r\nand purifying his spirit. If common water be employed for the dilution\r\nof alcohol, the resulting spirit will be turbid, owing principally to\r\nthe precipitation of sulphuric salts; this circumstance lately\r\noccasioned considerable embarrassment to the Curators of the Hunterian\r\nMuseum at the College of Surgeons, who were compelled to prepare their\r\nown spirit, in consequence of an excise regulation preventing the\r\ndistiller from sending out any spirit of that strength which is required\r\nfor their anatomical purposes. A curious fact has just been noticed in\r\nthe Laboratory of the Royal Institution, which is, that diluted spirit\r\n_becomes stronger_ by being kept in vessels that are carefully closed by\r\nbladder! whence it would seem, that alcoholic vapour transpires through\r\nthis animal membrane less freely than aqueous vapour; we are at present\r\nunable to offer a satisfactory explanation of this anomalous case of\r\ndistillation, but it is probably connected with the different solvent\r\npowers of these two liquids, in relation to the animal membrane. MED.\r\nUSES. Alcohol, although diluted to the degree of proof spirit, is still\r\ntoo strong for internal exhibition; indeed, where its use is indicated,\r\nit is more generally given in the form of wine, malt liquors, or ardent\r\nspirits, which must be regarded only as diluted alcohol, although each\r\nhas a peculiarity of operation, owing to the modifying influence of the\r\nother elements of the liquid; thus _Brandy_[647] is said to be simply\r\ncordial and stomachic;[648] _Rum_,[649] heating and sudorific; _Gin_ and\r\n_Whiskey_, diuretic; and _Arrack_,[650] styptic, heating, and narcotic;\r\nit seems also probable that a modified effect is produced by the\r\naddition of various other substances, such as sugar and acids, which\r\nlatter bodies, besides their anti-narcotic powers, appear to act by\r\nfavouring a more perfect combination and mutual penetration of the\r\nparticles of spirit and water. Foreign brandy derives its colour from\r\nthe oak cask, the intensity of which, therefore, affords some criterion\r\nof its age. The English have been in the habit of colouring their\r\nspirits with burnt sugar until lately, but now since the cause of the\r\nforeign colour is discovered, the scrapings of gall-nuts are employed\r\nfor that purpose, whence the sulphate of iron is no longer a test of\r\nbrandy being genuine.[651] The effects, also, which are produced by the\r\nhabitual use of fermented liquors, differ essentially according to the\r\nkind that is drunk; thus Ale and Porter, in consequence of the nutritive\r\nmatter, and perhaps the invigorating bitter with which they are charged,\r\nand the comparatively small proportion of alcohol which they contain,\r\ndispose to a plethora, which is not unfrequently terminated by apoplexy;\r\nSpirits, on the other hand, induce severe dyspepsia, obstructed and\r\nhardened liver, dropsy, and more than half of all our chronical\r\ndiseases; and Dr. Darwin moreover remarks that when they arise from this\r\ncause, they are liable to become hereditary, even to the third\r\ngeneration, gradually increasing, if the cause be continued, till the\r\nfamily become extinct; with regard to Wine, Rush has truly observed that\r\nits effects, like those of tyranny in a well formed government, are\r\nfirst felt in the extremities, while spirits like a bold invader, seize\r\nat once upon the vitals of the constitution; the different kinds of\r\nwine, however, produce very different and even opposite effects, as\r\nstated under the history of that article, (see _Vinum_.) The excise\r\nofficers frequently avail themselves of the peculiar power of the\r\nsub-acetate of lead to precipitate colouring matter, in order to remove\r\nfrom seized Holland Gin, the colour which it contains by being long kept\r\nin the tubs in which it is smuggled over. This practice, however,\r\nrenders the gin liable to gripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         SPIRITUS TEREBINTHINÆ.\r\n\r\n                       See _Terebinthinæ Oleum_.\r\n\r\n                  SPONGIA USTA.

It is probably a triple compound of oxygen,\r\nhydrogen, and some unknown base. SOLUBILITY. It is insoluble in water\r\nand alcohol, but soluble in oils, especially in that of linseed, which\r\nis a powerful solvent of all sulphureous substances. In boiling oil of\r\nturpentine it is entirely soluble. MEDICINAL USES. It is laxative and\r\ndiaphoretic; it acts principally upon the large intestines, and very\r\nmildly, whence it proves useful in hæmorrhoidal affections (_Form. 74_);\r\nand in consequence of the diaphoresis which it also excites, it is\r\nuseful in chronic rheumatisms, catarrhs, and in some cutaneous\r\naffections.[654] To promote its purgative effects, _magnesia_ will be\r\nfound a serviceable adjunct in hæmorrhoids; it may be given in the form\r\nof an electuary, or suspended in milk; its solution in oil (_Oleum\r\nSulphuratum_) is a most nauseous and acrid preparation. When sulphur is\r\ncombined with metallic remedies, it generally lessens their activity.\r\nIts effects in curing psora are universally admitted, and the only\r\nobjection to its use is the disgusting smell which accompanies its\r\napplication; see _Unguent: Sulphuris_. Dr. Clarke of Dublin recommends a\r\nlotion which he says contains a sufficient impregnation of sulphur for\r\nthe cure of psora in children, to be made by adding an ounce of broken\r\nsulphur to a quart of boiling water, and allowing it to infuse for\r\ntwelve hours. In this process, the water probably takes up a small\r\nportion of sulphurous acid; it is difficult to explain the efficacy of\r\nthe lotion in any other manner. When sulphur is internally administered,\r\nit transpires through the skin in the state of sulphuretted hydrogen,\r\nand blackens the silver in the pockets of those who take it. DOSE ʒj to\r\nʒiij.

The practitioner should never introduce syrups into\r\nthose medicines which are liable to be injured by the generation of\r\nacids: I have frequently seen the _cretaceous mixture_, when charged\r\nwith syrup. Increase, instead of check, a diarrhœa; and the syrup of\r\npoppies, from its disposition to become acescent, will often aggravate\r\nrather than allay the cholic of infants. The syrup of Senna furnishes\r\nthe practitioner with a convenient purgative for children; that of\r\nbuckthorn is more violent, and is on that account but rarely used;\r\nbesides which, in preparing it the chemist not unfrequently substitutes\r\nthe berries of the _Cornus Sanguinea_, the Dogberry-tree, or those of\r\nthe _Rhamnus Frangula_, the Alder-buckthorn, for the Rhamnus\r\nCatharticus; a circumstance which necessarily renders the efficacy of\r\nthis syrup variable and uncertain; it is moreover often sophisticated\r\nwith treacle and jalap. The syrup of the rose, when made with the leaves\r\nof the _Damask_[656] rose, is gently laxative, and is well adapted for\r\nweak children; it is however not unusual, _coloris gratia_, to\r\nsubstitute the leaves of the _red_ rose, in which case the syrup will\r\npossess astringent instead of laxative properties. In the preparation of\r\nthe syrup of poppies,[657] the directions of the College are frequently\r\nnot obeyed; it is sometimes made by dissolving the extract in syrup,\r\nformed with coarse sugar, or even with treacle; at others, by adding\r\ntincture of opium to a coarse syrup, in the proportion of ♏︎x to every\r\nf℥j. In the preparation of the syrups of violets, the juice of red\r\ncabbage is generally substituted; this is at least a harmless fraud.\r\nNOTE. The syrups which are printed in _Italics_, are very susceptible of\r\ndecomposition, and should be kept in cool places.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           TABACI FOLIA. L.E.\r\n\r\n           (Nicotiana Tabacum. Folia Siccata. _Virginiana._)\r\n\r\n                          NICOTIANÆ FOLIA. D.\r\n\r\n                               _Tobacco._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, strong, narcotic, and fœtid; _Taste_, bitter, and\r\nextremely acrid; _Colour_, yellowish green, (its brown appearance is\r\nartificial, being produced by the action of _sulphate of iron_.)\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Mucilage, albumen, gluten, extractive, a bitter\r\nprinciple, _an essential oil_, nitrate of potass, which occasions its\r\ndeflagration, muriate of potass, and a peculiar proximate principle upon\r\nwhich the properties of the plant are supposed to depend, and which has\r\ntherefore been named _Nicotin_.[658] Vauquelin considers it as\r\napproaching the volatile oils in its properties; it is colourless, has\r\nan acrid taste, and the peculiar smell of tobacco, and occasions violent\r\nsneezing; with alcohol and water, it produces colourless solutions, from\r\nwhich it is thrown down by tincture of galls. SOLUBILITY. Tobacco yields\r\nits active matter both to water and spirit, but more perfectly to the\r\nlatter; long coction weakens its powers. An oil of tobacco of a most\r\npowerful nature, may be obtained by distilling the leaves and separating\r\nit from the water, on the top of which it will be found to float.[659]\r\nMED. USES. Tobacco is endued with energetic poisonous properties,\r\nproducing generally a universal tremor which is rarely the result of\r\nother poisons; the experiments of M. Orfila moreover demonstrate, that\r\nthe action of Tobacco is much more energetic when the soluble portion is\r\ninjected into the anus, than when it is applied to the cellular texture,\r\nand for a still stronger reason, than when introduced into the stomach.\r\nMr. Brodie, from the result of a well devised experiment, has deduced\r\nthe conclusion that the infusion of Tobacco acts upon the heart,\r\noccasioning syncope, through the medium of the nervous system. USES. As\r\na powerful sedative, it is sometimes valuable in medical practice; the\r\nleaves, when applied in the form of a cataplasm to the pit of the\r\nstomach, produce an emetic operation; (_Form. 67._) In cases of\r\nobstinate constipation, depending upon violent spasmodic constriction,\r\nor in _ileus_, or _incarcerated hernia_, clysters of the smoke of\r\nTobacco, or of an infusion made according to the London College, produce\r\nalmost immediate relief, (_Form. 26._); the practice is not unfrequently\r\nattended with severe vomiting, extreme debility, and cold sweats,\r\ncircumstances which render its administration highly dangerous in cases\r\nwherein the patient has been already exhausted by previous suffering. I\r\nremember witnessing a lamentable instance of this truth some years ago;\r\na medical practitioner, after repeated trials to reduce a strangulated\r\nhernia, injected an infusion of Tobacco, and shortly afterwards sent the\r\npatient in a carriage to the Westminster Hospital, for the purpose of\r\nundergoing the operation; but the unfortunate man arrived only a few\r\nminutes before he expired. Clysters of Tobacco were some years ago\r\nrecommended in America, for the purpose of forwarding difficult\r\nparturition, by inducing relaxation and consequent dilatation of the _os\r\nuteri_, but the alarming symptoms which followed the single case in\r\nwhich Tobacco was thus employed, ought, says _Dr. Merriman_, to prevent\r\na repetition of the experiment.[660] It was also formerly proposed to\r\ninject infusions of Tobacco, for the purpose of recovering persons in a\r\nstate of _asphyxia_ from drowning; it is difficult to explain how such\r\nan idea could have entered into the mind of the rational physiologist.\r\nSmoking or chewing Tobacco has been also advised in cases of spasmodic\r\nasthma, and as a general sedative to relieve suffering; in the process\r\nof _smoking_, the oil is separated, and being rendered empyreumatic by\r\nheat, it is thus applied to the fauces in its most active state. As a\r\ndiuretic it was successfully exhibited by Dr. Fowler, but as its\r\noperation is uncertain and violent, and appears to be very analogous to\r\nthat of Digitalis, which is far more safe and manageable, it has been\r\nvery judiciously discarded from practice. The external application of\r\nTobacco in the form of cataplasm or infusion, has been applied to\r\nseveral species of cutaneous disease, but even in this state it is\r\nliable to exert its virulent effects. A woman applied to the heads of\r\nthree children afflicted with _tinea capitis_, a liniment consisting of\r\npowdered tobacco and butter, soon after which they experienced vertigo,\r\nviolent vomiting, and fainting. (_Ephemerides des Curieux de la Nature_,\r\nDec. ii. An: i. p. 46.) A case has just occurred in this country of a\r\nchild whose death was occasioned by her having swallowed a portion of\r\nhalf-smoked tobacco, which was taken from the pipe of her father, and in\r\nwhich there no doubt existed a quantity of essential oil, which had been\r\nseparated by the act of smoking. It is a curious fact, that the juice of\r\nthe green leaves instantly cures the stinging of nettles.\r\n\r\nADULTERATIONS. When it exhales a fetid odour, we may infer that it has\r\nbeen badly prepared, and not deprived of all its mucus; when pungent,\r\nthe presence of some deleterious drug is indicated: Cascarilla is very\r\nusually added to impart a peculiar flavour; Nitre is also employed for\r\nthe sake of making it kindle more rapidly, and to impress a lively\r\nsensation on the tongue; its vapour is of course very injurious to the\r\nlungs: its presence may be detected by treating a suspected sample with\r\nhot water, and after filtering the solution through charcoal, setting it\r\naside in order that it may yield its crystals by evaporation. Traces of\r\n_Lead_, _Copper_, or _Antimony_, may be discovered by boiling the\r\nTobacco in strong vinegar, and, after filtering it as before, by\r\nassaying it with appropriate tests. _Black Hellebore_, _Alum_, _Sugar_,\r\nand _Corrosive sublimate_ are amongst the more usual sophistications.\r\n_Dried Dock_ leaves are also sometimes substituted.

The varied flavour of different _Snuffs_ is owing to the leaf\r\nbeing in greater or less perfection; or to its having undergone some\r\ndegree of fermentation; thus, for instance, the _Macouba Snuff_ of\r\nMartinique is principally indebted for its acknowledged superiority to\r\nthe fermentation which the Tobacco undergoes, from being moistened with\r\nthe best cane juice; other kinds are excited into fermentation by\r\nmoistening them with melasses and water.\r\n\r\nSnuff possesses all the powers of Tobacco; the celebrated Santeuil\r\nexperienced vomiting and horrible pains, amidst which he expired, in\r\nconsequence of having drank a glass of wine, into which had been put\r\nsome Spanish snuff.[661]\r\n\r\n\r\n                TAMARINDI PULPA.

L.E.D. _Turpentine._\r\n\r\nMost species of Pinus[664] may be made to yield (and many of them\r\nproduce spontaneously) a remarkable resinous juice, usually called\r\n_Turpentine:_ an appellation, however, which more properly belongs to\r\nthe product of a different genus, called by Linnæus _Pistachia_, which\r\ncontains the true _Terebinthus_[665] of the ancients.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Consistence_, semifluid and tenacious, but becoming more or\r\nless concrete by age; _Odour_, aromatic; _Taste_, pungent, austere, and\r\nastringent. It is inflammable. SOLUBILITY. It is entirely soluble in\r\nrectified spirit, but not at all in water; although it becomes miscible\r\nwith that fluid, by the mediation of the yelk or the white of an egg,\r\nbut more elegantly by that of vegetable mucilage, and forms a milky\r\nliquor. It is capable of entering into union with fixed oils. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Resin, and an essential oil, the proportions of which vary\r\naccording to the species of Pine from which it is obtained. They all,\r\nhowever, possess the same general chemical, as well as medicinal\r\nproperties, viz. When internally taken, says Dr. Maton, they seem to\r\nwarm the _viscera_, raise the pulse, and impart additional excitement to\r\nthe vascular system; applied externally, they increase the tone of the\r\npart, counteract indolence of action, and deterge, as it were,\r\nill-conditioned ulcers. _Internal_ ulcerations indeed, especially of the\r\nurinary passages, as well as laxities of the seminal and uterine\r\nvessels, are supposed to be diminished by the exhibition of preparations\r\nof this nature. They certainly appear to act in a peculiar manner on the\r\nurinary organs, impregnating the water with a violet smell, and there\r\nare strong grounds for believing that its volatile element, developed by\r\nthe powers of digestion, passes into the circulation, and is eliminated\r\nby the kidneys, whose secreting vessels are thus stimulated _by its\r\ncontact_. (_Page 93._) Pulmonary complaints, as obstinate coughs and\r\nasthmatic affections, have been said to give way to medicines of this\r\nclass; yet, in modern practice, recourse is rarely had to them in such\r\ncases, and their exhibition is even considered hazardous. The ancients\r\nwere accustomed to medicate their wines with various Terebinthinate\r\nsubstances, for the effect of which, see _Vinum_.\r\n\r\nThe particular preparations of Turpentine most employed in medicine,\r\nwill be noticed under the different species.\r\n\r\n1. TEREBINTHINA CANADENSIS. L. (Pinus Balsamea. _Resina Liquida._)\r\n_Canada Turpentine_, or _Canada Balsam_.[666] This is a transparent\r\nwhitish juice, brought to this country from Canada, and apparently, says\r\nDr. Maton, not very different in its qualities from the celebrated _Balm\r\nof Gilead_,[667] so high in esteem among the eastern nations, and so\r\nstrongly recommended in a variety of complaints. Hitherto, however, it\r\nhas not been much employed in England. Its odour is agreeable, and its\r\ntaste strong and pungent.\r\n\r\n2. TEREBINTHINA CHIA. L. (Pistachia Terebinthus.) _Chio_, or _Cyprus\r\nTurpentine_. The superiority of this species to all the products of the\r\npine tribe, was well known to, and described by, most of the ancient\r\nwriters on the materia medica. It is pellucid, with a bluish-green cast.\r\n\r\n3. TEREBINTHINA VULGARIS. L. (Pinus Sylvestris. _Scotch Fir._) _Common\r\nTurpentine._ _Horse Turpentine._ This species is more coarse and dense\r\nthan any other kind, and has an opaque light brown colour; its\r\nconsistence may be compared to that of honey; the taste is very acrid,\r\nhot, and disagreeable, and the smell much less pleasant than either the\r\n_Venice_ or the _Strasburg_ turpentine. It is the kind which, as its\r\nname implies, is most commonly employed, and although inferior in\r\nquality to that of the turpentine tree, _Pistachia Terebinthus_ (Chio or\r\nCyprus), the Larch, _Pinus Larix_ (Venice Turpentine), and the Silver\r\nFir, _Pinus Picea_ (Strasburgh Turpentine), especially for internal use,\r\nyet it is too often substituted for them in the shops of the druggist.\r\nThe Colleges of London and Edinburgh direct the common turpentine to be\r\nused chiefly in external applications, for which it was also much\r\nemployed by the ancients. Celsus mentions, “_Resina liquida pinea_,” as\r\nentering into the composition of many of his “_Malagmata_,” and the\r\n“_Resina liquida_,” of other writers would appear to be of the same\r\nkind. The _Unguentum Elemi compositum_ contains this resinous juice as a\r\nprincipal ingredient.\r\n\r\n4. TEREBINTHINA VENETA. (Pinus Larix.)[668] _The Larch._ _Venice\r\nTurpentine._ The resin is by most writers, and in the shops, esteemed\r\nthe best, after that of _Pistachia Terebinthus_, of those juices\r\ncommonly called _Turpentines_. It is usually thinner than any other\r\nkind, of a pale yellowish colour, and of a hot, pungent, bitterish\r\ntaste; the smell is strong, and far from being agreeable. Although it\r\nbears the name of _Venice Turpentine_, very little of it is exported\r\nfrom the Venetian territories; but it is probable that the merchants of\r\nthat country were the first who substituted it for the genuine\r\nTurpentine of Cyprus. The resinous juice of the Larch is said to remain\r\nalways, or at least a very long time, in a state of liquidity; a\r\nproperty which is particularly adverted to by Pliny.[669] As a Diuretic,\r\nthe _Venice_ Turpentine has been generally preferred to all the other\r\nkinds; and it is said to relax the bowels more, for which reason\r\n_Riverius_[670] considers it as being safer than other irritating\r\ndiuretics.\r\n\r\n5. TEREBINTHINA ARGENTORATENSIS. (Pinus Picea.) _Strasburg Turpentine._\r\nThis resin is generally of a middle consistence between that of the\r\n_Terebinthus_ and the _Larix_; more transparent and less tenacious than\r\neither; in colour yellowish brown; in smell more agreeable than any\r\nother turpentine, except the Cyprian; in taste the bitterest, yet the\r\nleast acrid.\r\n\r\n_Form of Exhibition._ The Turpentines may be either made into Pills with\r\npowdered liquorice root, or suspended in water by the intervention of\r\negg or mucilage; for which purpose, ℥j requires the yelk of one egg, or\r\nʒiss of gum arabic. _Dose_, gr. x to ʒj.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TEREBINTHINÆ OLEUM. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                          _Oil of Turpentine._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, a limpid and colourless liquid, whose specific\r\ngravity is only ·792; _Odour_, strong, penetrating, and peculiar;\r\n_Taste_, hot, bitter and pungent. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is an\r\nessential oil, possessing, however, peculiar habitudes with respect to\r\nalcohol, being readily dissolved by _hot_ alcohol, but separating again\r\nin drops, as the spirit cools; in the cold it is sparingly soluble in\r\nthe strongest alcohol, and separates from it on standing; but it\r\ndissolves completely in six parts of sulphuric æther. It is not acted\r\nupon by the alkalies, except by long triture, when it is converted into\r\na species of resin.[671] MED. USES. It acts according to the dose,\r\neither on the _primæ viæ_ producing catharsis, or on the kidneys,\r\nexciting diuresis; thus its operation offers another illustration of the\r\nviews which I have so frequently urged during the progress of the\r\npresent work; it furnishes a striking example of the important influence\r\nof quantity, or _dose_, in determining the specific operation of a\r\nremedy; thus _two fluid-drachms_ of the oil may so excite the urinary\r\norgans as to produce even bloody urine, and the other ill effects\r\ndescribed by Boerhaave and Lange; whereas _six fluid-drachms_, or a\r\n_fluid-ounce_, will stimulate the bowels, and produce scarcely any\r\napparent effect upon the kidneys.\r\n\r\nAs a medicine acting powerfully on the first passages, its value seems\r\nonly to have been lately appreciated; in Tænia, it may be said to act\r\nalmost as a specific remedy, discharging it in all cases, _dead_. In\r\nobstinate constipation, depending on affections of the brain, I have\r\nlately had several opportunities or witnessing its beneficial effects;\r\nin an unfortunate instance of _Hydrocephalus acutus_ in a boy of\r\nthirteen years of age,[672] it brought away an accumulation of feculent\r\nmatter almost incredible as to quantity, after the total failure of the\r\nstrongest doses of ordinary purgatives; and, I believe, if its dose be\r\nsufficiently large, that it may generally be administered with perfect\r\nsafety and confidence. Dr. Latham has long regarded it as a valuable\r\nmedicine in Epilepsy, in which cases it may in the first instance prove\r\nbeneficial by unloading the bowels, and subsequently in producing an\r\naffection of the head peculiar to its use; and, which generally succeeds\r\na large dose, it is an approach to intoxication, but is unaccompanied\r\nwith that hilarity and elevation of thought that so usually follow the\r\npotation of spirituous liquors. In small doses it produces diuresis, and\r\nis used with much advantage in sciatica and lumbago.[673] Its use in\r\ndiseases of the kidneys originating from ulcerations and obstructions in\r\nthose organs has been very highly extolled. Cheyne, in his Essay on the\r\ngout, recommends it as a specific in Sciatica; upon this subject my own\r\nexperience so completely confirms the truth of Dr. Maton’s observations,\r\nthat I shall here insert them. “If,” says he, “I may be allowed to offer\r\nthe result of my own practice, its effects are in a few instances\r\nsuccessful in the removal of that disease; and even those cases which I\r\nhave seen cured under its use, appeared to be rather of the symptomatic\r\nthan idiophatic kind; it is reasonable to presume that the sciatic\r\nnerve, from its origin and course, may owe some of its morbid affections\r\nto an obstructed ureter, as well as to a rheumatic diathesis.” _Form:\r\n50._ Hunter spoke of oil of turpentine as a styptic, and it has been\r\nadministered in the Almond emulsion in cases of internal hemorrhage of\r\nan active nature. We should however be very careful how we make such an\r\nexperiment. This oil has the effect of communicating the odour of\r\nviolets to the urine of those who take it, and what is still more\r\nextraordinary, to those even who merely expose themselves for a short\r\ntime to its effluvia:[674] a mixture of ♏︎x of this oil with f℥j of\r\nalmond oil, introduced upon cotton into the ears, is serviceable in\r\ncases of deafness resulting from a diseased action of the ceruminiferous\r\nglands; it is also employed as a local stimulant in a variety of cases:\r\nand in cholic, and obstinate constipation, it is sometimes exhibited in\r\nthe form of an enema. In America, oil of Turpentine, in doses of a\r\ndrachm every hour or two, has been successfully administered in cases of\r\nYellow fever, when, says Dr. Chapman, it appears to be soothing in its\r\neffects, removing the sense of heat and irritation in the stomach,\r\nsubduing the force of vascular action and general excitement, and\r\ninducing at once a condition of more comfort and security. Orfila also\r\nrecommends it as the best corrective of inflammation in the stomach from\r\nacrid poisons. In this country it has been very successfully employed in\r\ncases of Melæna, and in Puerperal fever. As a stimulating liniment its\r\nadvantages are considerable, see _Liniment: Terebinth:_ In Germany,\r\nNorway, and some parts of the Russian Empire, this essential oil is\r\nfrequently used as a remedy for lesions of the tendons, and other\r\nbruises.[675] DOSE as an anthelmintic, f℥ss-f℥ij, repeated every eight\r\nhours until the worm is ejected; in these large quantities it is more\r\nconvenient, as well as more efficacious, to administer it like castor\r\noil, floating upon some liquid aromatic vehicle:[676] by rubbing up Oil\r\nof Turpentine with mucilage, we do but render it more pungent, and\r\ndifficult to swallow. As a diuretic or stimulant it may be given in the\r\nform of an electuary, in doses of from ♏︎x to fʒj. It may be also\r\nemployed as a very active clyster, made by carefully incorporating one\r\nor two table spoonsful of the oil with the yelk of an egg, and adding to\r\nit a pint of thin mucilage. This terebinthinate clyster is well\r\ncalculated to relieve a paroxysm of flatulent cholic. OFFICINAL PREP.\r\n_Liniment. Terebinth_. L. The Pharmacopœias direct the rectification of\r\nthe oil by redistillation,[677] when it is commonly called _Spirit_ of\r\nturpentine, but it appears to be an unnecessary refinement. Dr. Nimmo\r\nhas proposed the following process for purifying the oil intended for\r\nmedicinal use, by which it is said to have its disagreeable flavour\r\nlessened without sustaining any loss of efficacy. To eight parts of the\r\noil, add one part of the strongest alcohol, and let them be well\r\nagitated together. In a few minutes a separation takes place; the oil,\r\nunless very impure, falls to the bottom, and the alcohol, having\r\ndischarged the impurities, floats at the top. Pour off the alcoholic\r\nportion, add a similar quantity of alcohol, and proceed as before. If\r\nthis be repeated three or four times, the oil will become nearly\r\ntasteless, almost inodorous, and when evaporated will leave no residuum.\r\nBut pure as the oil may be thus rendered, it speedily returns to its\r\noriginal condition.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TIGLII OLEUM. L. Oil of Tiglium.\r\n\r\n             Croton Tiglium. _Oleum e Seminibus expressum._\r\n\r\nThe _Croton Tiglium_ is a native of the island of Ceylon, and is found\r\nin Malabar, China, Cochinchina, and the Molucca Islands. Every part of\r\nthe plant would seem to be endowed with medicinal activity; the _root_\r\nacts as a drastic purgative, and when pulverized, and exhibited in the\r\ndose of a few grains, is considered at Amboyna and Batavia, as a\r\nspecific for dropsy; the _wood_ (_lignum Pavanæ_) produces, when\r\nadministered in small doses, a diaphoretic effect, and in larger ones it\r\nproves drastic; the _leaves_ are also purgative, and when dried and\r\npowdered are supposed to afford an antidote against the bite of the\r\n_cobra del Capella_. The _seeds_, however, are the parts which have been\r\nmore generally employed in medicine, the effects of which appear to have\r\nbeen well known for nearly a thousand years.[A] They were early\r\nintroduced into Europe, and long known under the names of _Grana\r\nMolucca_—_Tilii Grana_—and _Grana Tiglia_.[678] It appears that they\r\nwere at first very frequently administered, but their extreme acrimony\r\nand violence,[679] and probably the accidents which arose from their\r\ninjudicious use, soon banished the article from medical practice; in\r\nIndia, however these seeds are still employed as an effectual purgative,\r\nafter first undergoing the process of roasting, or baking, for the\r\npurpose of removing the shell, rendering the nut pulverulent, and at the\r\nsame time of moderating the acrimonious qualities.[680] The expressed\r\noil of these seeds does not appear to have been obtained in a separate\r\nform until a later period; Lemery speaks of it, and Geoffroy in\r\ndirecting its dose cautions us against giving more than ʒj!—he probably\r\nmeant a drop. Its use has very lately been revived, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt but that under proper restrictions, it may become a\r\nvaluable acquisition to the practitioner. The profession is indebted for\r\nits late introduction, or rather revival, to Mr. E. Conwell, of the East\r\nIndia Company’s Medical Service, on the Madras Establishment, who,[681]\r\nhaving for many years prescribed it with advantage, introduced a\r\nquantity of it for trial in London, through the medium of his friend,\r\nMr. Short, of Ratcliffe Highway.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This expressed oil has a yellow colour, a faint odour, and an\r\nacrid taste; these qualities however will be found to vary in different\r\nsamples; but the fact, as Dr. Nimmo[682] has justly observed, may be\r\nfairly explained, without suspecting the existence of any fraud, by\r\nsupposing that the seeds have undergone a different degree of\r\ntorrefaction, in order to separate the oil from the farinaceous part.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. The recent experiments of Dr. Nimmo have very\r\nsatisfactorily shewn that this oil consists of 45 parts of an _Acrid\r\npurgative principle_, and 55 of a fixed oil resembling that of olives,\r\nand not possessed of any cathartic property. The acrid principle appears\r\nto reside in a resinous matter soluble in alcohol and sulphuric æther,\r\nand in volatile and fixed oils. I have lately repeated some of Dr.\r\nNimmo’s experiments on a recently imported sample of oil, and with\r\nsimilar results. The acrid principle appears to bear a strong analogy to\r\nthat which I separated from elaterium, and as I gave to this latter\r\nprinciple the term _Elatin_, it seems to me that we might with much\r\npropriety, apply the name _Tiglin_ to the former, especially as it does\r\nnot appear to possess any of the characters and habitudes of a\r\nsalifiable basis; at all events the adoption of such a term will obviate\r\nthe necessity of circumlocution in our descriptions. SOLUBILITY. By\r\nalcohol the oil undergoes a ready decomposition; the _Tiglin_ is\r\ndissolved together with a very minute quantity of the oily part. Ether\r\nand oil of turpentine dissolve the whole; a fact which enables us, by\r\ndigesting the seeds in these menstrua, to obtain the article in as\r\ngenuine, and certainly in a much more uniform, condition, than by the\r\nprocesses of torrefaction and expression, as practised in India; for\r\nthis fact we are also indebted to Dr. Nimmo. MED. USES. As far as I have\r\nbeen able to ascertain the fact, this oil does not appear to produce any\r\neffects which cannot be commanded by other drastic purgatives; its value\r\ndepends upon the facility with which it may be administered; in some\r\ncases it is amply sufficient to touch the tongue, in others, a drop or\r\ntwo will be required. In maniacs, and in cases where the administration\r\nof bulky medicines is extremely difficult, it would seem to offer a\r\ndecided advantage.[683] FORMS OF EXHIBITION. It has been usually given\r\nin this country in the proportion of from one to two drops, in the form\r\nof pills. Dr. Nimmo’s discovery with respect to the chemical composition\r\nof the oil, very naturally suggested to him the mode of administering it\r\nin the form of an alcoholic tincture, (_Tinctura Tiglii_,) and he has\r\nfound by experience that such a preparation furnishes the means of\r\nreadily apportioning the dose to the various circumstances of the case;\r\nthus he found that in administering a tincture[684] in doses equivalent\r\nto the number of drops decomposed, the same effects were produced as\r\nhave been attributed to the entire oil. ADULTERATIONS. Much has been\r\nsaid upon the fraudulent admixture of this comparatively expensive\r\narticle with the cheaper fixed oils; and we believe with much truth; a\r\ncircumstance which will of necessity prevent the general use of the\r\narticle; and occasion very different reports with respect to its value\r\nand activity. Dr. Nimmo however proposes a method of detecting such\r\nadulteration, by a process suggested by the results of his experiments\r\nupon its composition, and whose rationalé will be easily understood\r\nafter the chemical history that has been just presented.\r\n\r\n“Let a very light phial be counterpoised in an accurate balance; pour\r\ninto it 50 grains of the suspected oil, add alcohol (which has been\r\npreviously digested[685] upon olive oil,) agitate them well, pour off\r\nthe solution and add more alcohol as before, until the dissolved portion\r\nis diffused in such a proportion of alcohol that each half drachm\r\nmeasure shall contain equal to one dose of the oil of _Tiglium_ for an\r\nadult. By afterwards placing the phial near a fire, to evaporate what\r\nremains of the alcohol in the bottle, _if the residuum be to that which\r\nhas been abstracted by the alcohol as_ 55 to 45, _the oil is genuine_.\r\nIf olive, or any other oil little soluble in alcohol, has been employed\r\nas the adulterating agent, it is evident that the residuum will be in a\r\nlarger proportion; but should _Castor Oil_ have been employed for that\r\npurpose, the proportion of the residuum will be smaller even than in the\r\ngenuine medicine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                     TINCTURÆ. L.E.D. _Tinctures._\r\n\r\nThese consist of alcohol, proof spirit, or spirit of greater or less\r\ndensity, holding in solution one or more of those proximate principles\r\nof vegetable or animal matter which are soluble in that menstruum, viz;\r\n_Sugar_, _resin_, _extractive_, _tannin_, _cinchonia_, _camphor_,\r\n_volatile oils_, _morphia_, _emetin_, _conein_, _elatin_, _tiglin_, and\r\n_several acids_. The proper solvent of those bodies, termed gum-resins,\r\nappears to be proof spirit. The compilers of the _Codex Medicamentarius_\r\nof Paris, have defined the different degrees of spirituous strength\r\nrequisite for the full and perfect extraction of the active elements of\r\ndifferent bodies with great truth and nicety; thus they direct for these\r\npurposes a spirit of three different standards, viz. 36 (_Sp._ _gr._\r\n·837,) 32 (·856) 22, (·915) of Beaumé’s hydrometer; with the first are\r\nprepared the _resinous_ tinctures; with the second those wherein the\r\n_resinous_, _extractive_, or _gummy_ elements, hold nearly an equal\r\nplace; and with the third those in which the latter predominate. We are\r\nmoreover indebted to this committee for having set at rest a question\r\nwhich has been long doubtful, whether the addition of alkaline agents\r\nincreases the extractive powers of the spirit? They have indeed\r\nascertained by experiment, that the reverse not frequently obtains; for\r\ninstance, they found that a smaller proportion of _guaiacum_ was\r\ndissolved by the spirit of ammonia, than by alcohol of the same\r\nstrength, and that the quantity of matter dissolved from the _root of\r\nValerian_ was the same in both cases. Very active substances, soluble in\r\nalcohol, are those which are particularly adapted for tinctures, since\r\nthey furnish preparations which are efficient in small doses, and very\r\nmanageable in extemporaneous prescription, such are the tinctures of\r\n_Opium_, _Digitalis_, _Hyoscyamus_, _Scilla_, _&c._ and from the\r\nchemical analysis of _Elaterium_, there can be no doubt but that a very\r\nactive and useful tincture of that substance might be introduced into\r\npractice; while Dr. Nimmo has very clearly proved that the active matter\r\nof the _Croton Tiglium_ may be thus concentrated, see _Tiglii Oleum_. On\r\nthe contrary, substances of little activity, except in large doses, are\r\nthe least adapted for this form of exhibition, as in such cases the\r\nsolvent will act more powerfully on the living system, than the\r\nprinciples which it may hold in solution, and when continued for any\r\nlength of time, will lay the foundation of the pernicious custom of dram\r\ndrinking; such tinctures, however, are not without their value in\r\ncombination; they sometimes increase the efficacy, and often correct the\r\noperation or disguise the flavour, of the medicines with which they may\r\nbe united; for example, the cathartic tinctures in _Formula 70_, augment\r\nthe purgative powers of the combination, at the same time that they\r\ncorrect its unpleasant operation; many other illustrations are presented\r\nin the different formulæ, for the explanation of which I must refer the\r\nstudent to the _Key Letters_. The addition of a tincture has likewise\r\nthe effect of preserving decoctions and infusions from spontaneous\r\ndecomposition, the _compound tincture of Cardamoms_ answers such an\r\nobject in the _compound decoction of Aloes_. Tinctures are sometimes\r\nmade with æther, but they are generally more strongly characterised by\r\nthe nature of the menstruum than by that of the substance dissolved in\r\nit; indeed, æther is used in these cases, not to dissolve substances\r\nwhich would resist the action of alcohol and water, but for the sake of\r\nits own direct action on the body; thus the Edinburgh pharmacopœia\r\ndirects an _Æthereal Tincture of Aloes_, which is more penetrating and\r\nstimulant than the alcoholic tinctures; the London College, with the\r\nexception of the _Aromatic Spirit of Æther_, does not recognise any\r\npreparation of this nature: I have already alluded to the _Æthereal\r\nTincture of Digitalis_ of the French Codex, than which nothing can be\r\nmore injudicious, for the digitalis does not amount to more than 1⁄70th\r\npart of the tincture, and must therefore be entirely counteracted by the\r\nstimulant effects of the menstruum. The same objection cannot be urged\r\nagainst the æthereal tinctures of _Castor_, _Musk_, and _Amber_, since\r\nin these cases, the subject and the menstruum concur in their mode of\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nTinctures derive their names from the substances which impart activity\r\nto them, and as the medicinal history of each substance is detailed\r\nunder its proper head, it will be unnecessary to dwell at any length\r\nupon the individual virtues of these tinctures.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  1. _Prepared with Rectified Spirit_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA ASSAFŒTIDÆ.

This is a\r\ncombination of Benzoin, Storax, and Tolu, with aloes; it is regarded as\r\na stimulating expectorant, and has been used in chronic catarrh and\r\nconfirmed asthma, but it is now very rarely employed, except as an\r\napplication to wounds and languid ulcers. It is sold under the name of\r\n_Friar’s Balsam_; and with respect to the use of this preparation as a\r\n_Styptic_, the public have fallen into a serious error; fresh wounds it\r\nmust necessarily injure, not only by its stimulating qualities, but by\r\nthe separation of the resins which take place on its intermixture with\r\nthe blood; these form a substance, which absolutely prevents what is\r\nmost desirable in such case,—the sides of the wound coming in contact\r\nand uniting by the first intention.

This is a solution of the guaiac in the\r\naromatic spirit of ammonia, and is consequently more stimulating than\r\nthe preceding one, and more efficacious as a sudorific: after arterial\r\naction is properly reduced, it is certainly one of our best remedies in\r\nrheumatism. _Dose_, fʒj to fʒij, at bed time, and its effects should be\r\npromoted by some warm beverage. It is worthy of remark, that nitrous\r\nacid and the spirit of nitric æther occasion an extraordinary\r\ndecomposition of these tinctures, separating the guaiacum into\r\ncoagulated masses, and imparting to the whole an intense bluish green\r\ncolour. I find that _chlorine_ has the same effect;[686] but the\r\nsulphuric and muriatic acids produce no disturbance, although all acids\r\nand acidulous salts must be considered as incompatible with it. If equal\r\nparts of quick-lime and powdered guaiacum be rubbed together, and a\r\nquantity of water be poured over them, and the mixture be allowed to\r\nstand until it becomes fine, we shall obtain a solution of this\r\nsubstance, which will mix in any proportion with aqueous vehicles\r\nwithout decomposition, and to which the aromatic spirit of ammonia may\r\nbe subsequently added with effect.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA TOLUIFERÆ BALSAMI.

A valuable stomachic. _Form. 32, 35, 154, 155,\r\n159._ _Dose_, fʒi-fʒiij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CAMPHORÆ COMPOSITA. _Tinctura Opii Camphorata._ P.L. 1787.\r\n_Elixir Paregoricum._[688] P.L. 1745. This preparation had undergone\r\nboth change of name and composition in the last Pharmacopœia; its old\r\nname was thought improper from its similarity to that of _tincture of\r\nopium_, and the _oil of aniseed_ has been omitted on account of its\r\ndisagreeable flavour; still, however, these perpetual changes are most\r\ndistressing; the tincture, as it is now prepared, is very different from\r\nthat which has been so long and so generally sold under the name of\r\n_Paregoric Elixir_, and the chemist is therefore obliged to keep both\r\nthe preparations, and to send the one or the other, according as it may\r\nbe required by the old or new name. One fluid-ounce contains nearly two\r\ngrains of Opium and of benzoic acid, and about one grain and a quarter\r\nof camphor. In _doses_ of fʒj to fʒiij, it is anodyne.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CANTHARIDES. D. This tincture is highly stimulating, acting\r\nwith great energy upon the urinary organs; it therefore offers a\r\nresource in gleets, fluor albus, incontinence of urine, &c. it has also\r\nproved serviceable as a highly stimulating diuretic, in cases of\r\n_Hydrops Ovarii_. See _Form. 116_. _Dose_, ♏︎x to fʒj, given in some\r\ndemulcent infusion; it is likewise employed with advantage as a\r\nstimulating embrocation and rubefacient, in conjunction with _soap_ or\r\ncamphor _liniment_. Externally it has been used in the cure of Sinuses,\r\nand fistulous openings, in the proportion of three fluid-drachms to a\r\npint of water.[689]\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CAPSICI. L. It is an excellent stimulant. See _Capsici Baccæ_.\r\n_Dose_, ♏︎x to fʒi.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CARDAMOMI COMPOSITA. L. An agreeable cordial, and adjunct to\r\nbitter infusions. See _Form. 47, 51_.[690] _Dose_, fʒi to fʒij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CASCARILLÆ. L.D. It is added with much effect to different\r\nstomachic infusions. See _Form. 33, 39, 41_. _Dose_, fʒi to fʒiij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CATECHU. L.E.D. A warm and grateful astringent; very useful as\r\nan adjunct to cretaceous mixtures in diarrhœa, &c. See _Form. 51, 52,\r\n58_. _Dose_, fʒi to fʒiij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CINCHONÆ. L.E.D. Used as an adjunct to the decoction or\r\ninfusion of the bark. See _Form. 126, 127_. _Dose_, fʒj to f℥ss. It\r\nshould be preserved in a place which is not very cold; for a low\r\ntemperature precipitates the Morphia; this inconvenience, however, is\r\nobviated by the addition of a little acetic acid, without diminishing\r\nthe efficacy of the tincture.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CINCHONÆ COMPOSITA. This resembles the celebrated tincture of\r\nHuxham, and although it contains less cinchona than the simple tincture,\r\nyet from the addition of aromatics it is more grateful and stomachic.\r\n_Dose_, fʒj to f℥ss.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CINNAMOMI. L.D. See _Form. 101_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CINNAMOMI COMPOSITA. L.E.D. As this is a combination of\r\naromatics with cinnamon, it is more grateful and stomachic than the\r\nsimple tincture. _Dose_, fʒ to fʒij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CONII MACULATI. E. As _Conein_ is perfectly soluble in spirit,\r\nthis tincture constitutes a very elegant and efficient form for the\r\nexhibition of _Hemlock_; I have frequently experienced its effects, when\r\nadded to febrifuge mixtures, with satisfaction. The London college has\r\nnot hitherto admitted it into the list of tinctures, which is to be\r\nregretted.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA CROCI. E.D. It has no medicinal use, independent of its colour.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA DIGITALIS. L.E.D. It is a very useful form for the exhibition\r\nof this valuable plant. _Dose_, ♏︎x, cautiously increased. See\r\n_Digitalis Folia_, and _Form. 32_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA GENTIANÆ COMPOSITA. L.E. An elegant stomachic bitter, but less\r\neligible as a remedy than the infusion. Dose, fʒi-fʒij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA HELLEBORI NIGRI. This preparation was strongly advised by Dr.\r\nMead, in uterine obstructions. _Dose_, ♏︎xxx to fʒj. See _Hellebori\r\nRadix_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA HUMULI. L.E. It is supposed to possess the tonic and narcotic\r\nproperties of the hop. _Dose_, fʒss to fʒiij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA HYOSCYAMI. L. This is a much more powerful narcotic than the\r\npreceding tincture; and it is not liable to affect the head, nor to\r\nproduce that disturbance in the biliary secretions which so inevitably\r\nfollows the use of opium. _Dose_, fʒss to fʒij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA JALAPÆ. L.E. As the activity of Jalap does not reside in any\r\none principle, but depends upon the combination of its gum, extractive,\r\nand resin, _proof_ spirit is of course its appropriate solvent; and the\r\nresulting tincture is therefore an active purgative, but it is rarely\r\nadministered except as an _adjuvant_ to cathartic combinations. _Dose_,\r\nfʒj to f℥ss. See _Form. 70, 76_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA KINO. L.E.D. This is little else than a solution of _Tannin_;\r\nit is however less astringent than the tincture of Catechu. _Dose_, fʒi\r\nto fʒij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA OPII. L.E.D. This is at once a most convenient and elegant form\r\nfor the exhibition of opium; ♏︎xix contain one grain of opium. See\r\n_Opium_, and _Form. 5, 7, 8, 20, 28, 52, 75, 76, 107, 110, 117, 127,\r\n136, 156, 172_. As an external application, when rubbed upon the skin it\r\nproduces anodyne effects, and it is said that these effects are very\r\nmuch increased by combining it with acetic acid; an _acetate of morphia_\r\nis probably thus produced.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA QUASSIÆ EXCELSÆ. E.D. The bitter principle of this root,\r\nQuassin, is completely extracted by proof spirit. _Dose_, fʒj.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA RHEI. L.E.D. Less purgative, but more astringent and aromatic\r\nthan the infusion. That made with the East Indian variety is of a deeper\r\ncolour, with a tinge of brown. _Dose_, f℥ss to f℥j.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA RHEI COMPOSITA. L. A cordial, used principally as an adjunct to\r\nsaline purgatives. _Dose_, fʒvj to f℥j, to produce purgative effects;\r\nfrom fʒj to fʒij, to act as a stomachic.\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh Pharmacopœia directs two compound tinctures of Rhubarb for\r\nsimilar purposes, viz. _Tinct. Rhei et Aloes_; and _Tinct. Rhei et\r\nGentianæ_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA SCILLÆ. L.E.D. _Dose_, ♏︎x to xxx. See _Form. 65, 109, 139_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA SENNÆ. L.E. _Dose_, fʒij to ℥j. See _Form. 70_. _Dose_, fʒij to\r\nf℥j.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA SENNÆ COMPOSITA. E. In this tincture, the Senna is quickened by\r\nJalap. _Dose_, fʒij to f℥j.[691]\r\n\r\nTINCTURA SERPENTARIÆ. L.E.D. Dose, fʒij to fʒiij. It is principally\r\nemployed as a stimulating adjunct to the infusion or decoction of\r\nCinchona, in typhoid fevers. OFFICINAL PREP. _Tinct. Cincon. comp. L.\r\nDose_, fʒi to fʒiij.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA VALERIANÆ. L.D. It is only used as an adjunct to the infusion\r\nof Valerian.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA VALERIANÆ AMMONIATA. L.D. This tincture is not more highly\r\ncharged with the principles of the Valerian than the foregoing one, but\r\nas the Ammonia corresponds with it in virtue, it is probably more\r\npowerful. _Dose_, fʒi to fʒij. See _Form. 23, 25_.\r\n\r\nTINCTURA ZINGIBERIS. L.D. A highly stimulating preparation. See _Form.\r\n33_. _Dose_, fʒss to fʒij.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      TINCTURA FERRI AMMONIATI. L.\r\n\r\nAs this is merely a spirituous solution of the _Ferrum Ammoniatum_, the\r\ntitle of tincture is improperly applied to it; it seems moreover to be a\r\nvery superfluous preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    TINCTURA FERRI MURIATIS. L.E.D.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Colour_, brownish yellow; _Taste_, styptic; _Odour_, very\r\npeculiar. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. It is an alcoholic solution of muriate\r\nof iron; the iron being in the state of _peroxide_. INCOMPATIBLE\r\nSUBSTANCES. _Alkalies_ and their _carbonates_; _the infusions of\r\nastringent vegetables_; _mucilage of gum arabic:_ by this latter\r\nsubstance it is precipitated in gelatinous flakes. MED. USES. It is one\r\nof the most active preparations of iron which we possess, and it\r\nmoreover appears to exert a specific influence upon the urinary\r\norgans.[692] Mr. Cline informs us that ♏︎x, given every ten minutes,\r\nuntil some sensible effect is produced, afford in dysuria speedy relief;\r\nin hemorrhage from the bladder, kidneys, or uterus, its acts as a\r\npowerful styptic. See _Form. 35, 60, 97, 114_. Externally, it is very\r\nefficacious in destroying venereal warts, either used alone, or diluted\r\nwith a small portion of water. _Dose_, ♏︎x to fʒss, or fʒj.[693]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TORMENTILLÆ RADIX. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                        Tormentilla Officinalis.\r\n\r\n                           _Tormentil Root._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. This root is knotty, externally blackish, internally reddish;\r\n_Odour_, slightly aromatic; _Taste_, austere and styptic. CHEMICAL\r\nCOMPOSITION. Its active matter is chiefly _Tannin_, and except galls and\r\ncatechu, it appears to contain a larger proportion than any other\r\nvegetable astringent.[694] SOLUBILITY. Boiling water extracts all its\r\nvirtues, as also does spirit. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _Solutions of\r\nIsinglass_, _the Salts of Iron_; _Alkalies_ and _Alkaline Earths_. MED.\r\nUSES. It has been chiefly used in diarrhœa, and it is very efficacious\r\nin that which is so frequently attendant on Phthisis. Dr. Fordyce\r\nrecommends its union with Ipecacuan, by which combination, he observes,\r\nwe shall astringe the vessels of the intestines, and at the same time\r\nrelax those of the skin. FORMS OF EXHIBITION. In substance, or in\r\ndecoction made by boiling ℥j of the root in oiss of water until reduced\r\nto oj. DOSE, of the substance in powder, ʒss to ʒj; of the above\r\ndecoction f℥j thrice a day. OFFICINAL PREP. _Pulv. Cret. Comp._ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TOXICODENDRI FOLIA.

Its leaves are inodorous, but have a sub-acrid taste.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gallic acid, tannin, and a certain acrimonious\r\nmatter, upon which the virtues of the plant depend, and which, according\r\nto Van Mons, is disengaged from the leaves in the state of gas during\r\nthe night, or while they do not receive the direct rays of the sun. MED.\r\nUSES. Dr. Alderson of Hull introduced the leaves of this plant to\r\nnotice, in whose hands they proved successful in several cases of\r\nParalysis; the same results however have not been obtained by other\r\nphysicians; the plant has therefore fallen into disuse, and might, in\r\ndeference to public opinion, be removed from the materia medica. When\r\napplied externally it has been known to produce an erysipelatous\r\naffection of the skin; a remarkable instance of which lately occurred at\r\nthe Botanic garden at Chelsea, where a person merely rubbed his eye\r\nafter having casually touched the plant in question.\r\n\r\n\r\n  TUSSILAGO. (Tussilago Farfara—_Folia_, _Flores_.) _Coltsfoot_.[695]\r\n\r\nThis plant has been regarded as a powerful expectorant from the earliest\r\nages; it is at present only valued for the mucilage which it affords; a\r\nhandful of the leaves boiled in oij of water, until reduced to oj, will\r\nfurnish, by the addition of a little sugar candy, a very grateful\r\ndemulcent.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        VALERIANÆ RADIX. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                 (Valeriana Officinalis. _Sylvestris._)\r\n\r\n                            _Valerian Root._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, strong, peculiar and unpleasant; _Taste_, warm,\r\nbitter, and sub-acrid. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Extractive, gum, resin,\r\nfecula, tannin, and a peculiar essential oil which seems to contain\r\ncamphor, and on which its virtues probably depend. SOLUBILITY. Its\r\nactive matter is extracted by boiling water, alcohol, and the solutions\r\nof the pure alkalies. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. _The salts of iron._ MED.\r\nUSES. It is antispasmodic, tonic, and emmenagogue; and it is highly\r\nbeneficial in those diseases which appear to be connected with a morbid\r\nsusceptibility of the nervous system, as in hysteria, hemicrania, and in\r\nsome species of epilepsy; and it would appear that its virtues in such\r\ncomplaints may be frequently increased by combining it with cinchona.\r\nFORMS OF EXHIBITION. The form of powder is the most effectual, and next\r\nto this a strong tincture made with proof spirit; by decoction its\r\npowers are considerably impaired, and consequently the extract is an\r\ninefficient preparation. DOSE of the powder ℈j to ʒj; when the flavour\r\ndisgusts, the addition of a small portion of mace or cinnamon will be\r\nfound to disguise it. See _Form. 25, 31, 38_.

The roots of a species of _crowfoot_ are\r\nsometimes mixed with those of valerian; they may be distinguished by a\r\ncaustic taste on chewing them; the roots have also often a disagreeable\r\nsmell from the urine of cats, who are allured and delighted by their\r\nodour; and they are sometimes inert, from not having been taken up at a\r\nproper season, or from not having been carefully preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 VERATRI RADIX.

SOLUBILITY. Its active principles are soluble in water,\r\nalcohol, and the alkalies. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Pelletier and Caventou\r\nhave lately discovered in this vegetable a new alkaline principle,\r\nwhite, crystalline, and acrid, to which they have given the name of\r\n_Veratria:_ it appears to exist in combination with gallic acid. MED.\r\nUSES. The effects of this root are extremely violent and poisonous; the\r\nancients employed it in various obstinate cases, but they generally\r\nregarded it as their last resource; it acts as a violent emetic and\r\ncathartic, producing bloody stools, great anxiety, tremors, and\r\nconvulsions. Etmuller says, that the external application of the root to\r\nthe abdomen, will produce vomiting; and Schroeder observed the same\r\nphenomenon to take place in a case where it was used as a suppository,\r\nand its juice has been applied to the purpose of poisoning arrows;\r\nnotwithstanding these effects however the veratrum has been very safely\r\nand successfully administered in cases of mania, epilepsy, lepra, and\r\ngout:[696] but the most ordinary use of white hellebore is as a local\r\nstimulant; as an adjunct to errhine powders; or in the form of\r\ndecoction, as a lotion; or mixed with a lard, as an ointment in\r\nscabies,[697] and herpetic eruptions: great caution however is required\r\nin its application, for several authors affirm that as an errhine, it\r\nhas caused abortions, floodings which could not be restrained, and fatal\r\nhemorrhages from the nose.

Sulphur. comp._ L.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             VINUM. _Wine._\r\n\r\nThe term wine is more strictly and especially applied to express the\r\nfermented juice of the _Grape_, although it is generally used to denote\r\nthat of _any_ sub-acid fruit. The presence of _Tartar_ is perhaps the\r\ncircumstance by which the grape is most strongly distinguished from all\r\nthe other sub-acid fruits that have been applied to the purpose of wine\r\nmaking. The juice of the grape, moreover, contains within itself all the\r\nprinciples essential to vinification, in such a proportion and state of\r\nbalance as to enable it at once to undergo a regular and complete\r\nfermentation, whereas the juices of other fruits require artificial\r\nadditions for this purpose; and the scientific application and due\r\nadjustment of these means, constitute the art of making wines.[698] It\r\nhas been remarked, that all those wines that contain an excess of malic\r\nacid are of a bad quality, hence the grand defect that is necessarily\r\ninherent in the wines of this country, and which leads them to partake\r\nof the properties of cider, for in the place of the _tartaric_, the\r\n_malic acid_ always predominates in native fruits.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic ingredient of all wines is _Alcohol_, and the\r\nquantity of this, and the condition or state of combination in which it\r\nexists, are the circumstances that include all the interesting and\r\ndisputed points of medical enquiry. Daily experience convinces us that\r\nthe same quantity of alcohol, applied to the stomach under the form of\r\nnatural wine, and in a state of mixture with water, will produce very\r\ndifferent effects upon the body, and to an extent which it is difficult\r\nto comprehend; it has, for instance, been demonstrated that Port,\r\nMadeira, and Sherry, contain from one-fourth to one-fifth their bulk of\r\nalcohol, so that a person who takes a bottle of either of them, will\r\nthus take nearly half a pint of alcohol, or almost a pint of pure\r\nbrandy! and moreover that different wines, although of the same specific\r\ngravity, and consequently containing the same absolute proportion of the\r\nspirit, will be found to vary very considerably in their intoxicating\r\npowers; no wonder then that such results should stagger the philosopher,\r\nwho is naturally unwilling to accept any tests of difference from the\r\nnervous system, which elude the ordinary resources of analytical\r\nchemistry; the conclusion was therefore drawn, that alcohol must\r\nnecessarily exist in wine in a far different condition from that in\r\nwhich we know it in a separate state, or in other words, that its\r\nelements only could exist in the vinous liquor, and that their union was\r\ndetermined, and consequently alcohol produced, by the action of\r\ndistillation. That it was the _product_, and not the _educt_ of\r\ndistillation, was an opinion which originated with Rouelle, who asserted\r\nthat alcohol was not completely formed, until the temperature was raised\r\nto the point of distillation; more lately the same doctrine was revived\r\nand promulgated by Fabbroni, in the memoirs of the Florentine Academy.\r\nGay Lussac has, however, silenced the clamorous partisans of this\r\ntheory, by separating the alcohol by distillation at the temperature of\r\n66° _Fah._ and by the aid of a _vacuum_, it has since been effected at\r\n56°: besides, it has been shewn that by precipitating the colouring\r\nmatter and some of the other elements of the wine by _sub-acetate of\r\nlead_, and then saturating the clear liquor with _sub-carbonate of\r\npotass_, the alcohol may be completely separated without any elevation\r\nof temperature; and by this ingenious expedient Mr. Brande has been\r\nenabled to construct a table, exhibiting the proportions of combined\r\nalcohol which exist in the several kinds of wine: no doubt therefore can\r\nremain upon this subject, and the fact of the difference of effect,\r\nproduced by the same bulk of alcohol, when presented to the stomach in\r\ndifferent states of combination, adds another striking and instructive\r\nillustration to those already enumerated in the course of this work, of\r\nthe extraordinary powers of chemical combination in modifying the\r\nactivity of substances upon the living system. In the present instance,\r\nthe alcohol is so combined with the extractive matter of the wine, that\r\nit is probably incapable of exerting its full specific effects upon the\r\nstomach, before it becomes altered in its properties, or, in other\r\nwords, _digested:_ and this view of the subject may be fairly urged in\r\nexplanation of the reason why the intoxicating effects of the same wine\r\nare so liable to vary in degree, in the same individual, from the\r\npeculiar state of his digestive organs at the time of its potation.[699]\r\nHitherto we have only spoken of _pure_ wine, but it is essential to\r\nstate that the stronger wines of Spain, Portugal, and Sicily, are\r\nrendered remarkable in this country by the addition of _Brandy_, and\r\nmust consequently contain _uncombined_ alcohol, the proportion of which\r\nhowever will not necessarily bear a ratio to the quantity added,\r\nbecause, at the period of its admixture, a renewed fermentation is\r\nproduced by the scientific vintner, which will assimilate and combine a\r\ncertain portion of the foreign spirit with the wine: this manipulation,\r\nin technical language, is called _fretting-in_. The free alcohol may,\r\naccording to the experiments of Fabbroni, be immediately separated by\r\nsaturating the vinous fluid with _sub-carbonate of potass_, while the\r\ncombined portion will remain undisturbed: in ascertaining the\r\nfabrication and salubrity of a wine, this circumstance ought always to\r\nconstitute a leading feature in the inquiry; and the tables of Mr.\r\nBrande would have been greatly enhanced in practical value, had the\r\nrelative proportions of _uncombined_ spirit been appreciated in his\r\nexperiments, since it is to _this_, and not to the _combined_ alcohol,\r\nthat the injurious effects of the wine are to be attributed. “It is well\r\nknown,” observes Dr. Macculloch, “that diseases of the liver are the\r\nmost common, and the most formidable of those produced by the use of\r\n_ardent_ spirits; it is equally certain that no such disorders follow\r\nthe intemperate use of _pure_ wine, however long indulged in: to the\r\nconcealed and unwitting consumption of spirit, therefore, as contained\r\nin the wines commonly drunk in this country, is to be attributed the\r\nexcessive prevalence of those hepatic affections which are comparatively\r\nlittle known to our continental neighbours.” Thus much is certain, that\r\nour ordinary wines contain no alcohol, but what is disarmed of its\r\nvirulence by the prophylactic energies of combination.\r\n\r\nThe odour, or _bouquet_, and flavour which distinguish one wine from\r\nanother, evidently depend upon some volatile and fugacious principle,\r\nsoluble in alcohol; this in sweet and half fermented wines, is\r\nimmediately derived from the fruit, as in those from the _Frontignan_\r\nand _Muscat_ grapes; but in the more perfect wines, as in _Claret_,\r\n_Hermitage_, _Rivesaltes_, and _Burgundy_, it bears no resemblance to\r\nthe natural flavour of the fruit, but is altogether the product of the\r\nvinous process; and in some wines it arises from the introduction of\r\nflavouring ingredients, as from almonds in Madeira wines, as well as in\r\nthose of Xeres and Saint Lucar, and hence their well known nutty\r\nflavour. Among the ancients it was formerly, and in modern Greece it is\r\nto this day, the fashion to give a resinous flavour, by the introduction\r\nof Turpentine into the casks.[700] These wines are supposed to assist\r\ndigestion, to restrain ulcerous, and other morbid discharges, to provoke\r\nurine, and to strengthen the bowels; but Dioscorides also informs us\r\nthat they were known to produce vertigo, pain in the head, and many\r\nevils not incidental to the same quantity of vinous liquor when free\r\nfrom such admixtures.[701]\r\n\r\nWines admit of being arranged into four classes.[702]\r\n\r\n1. SWEET WINES; which contain the greatest proportion of extractive and\r\nsaccharine matter, and generally the least ardent spirit, though this is\r\noften rather disguised than absent; as in these wines a proportion of\r\nsugar has remained unchanged during the process of vinification, they\r\nmust be considered as the results of an imperfect fermentation, and are\r\nin fact mixtures of wine and sugar; accordingly, whatever arrests the\r\nprogress of fermentation, must have a tendency to produce a sweet wine;\r\nthus boiling the _must_ or drying the fruit will, by partially\r\nseparating the natural leaven and dissipating the water, occasion such a\r\nresult as is exemplified by the manufacture of the wines of Cyprus, the\r\n_vino cotto_ of the Italians and the _vinum coctum_ of the ancients, by\r\nthat of _Frontignac_, the rich and luscious wines of _Canary_, the\r\ncelebrated _Tokay_, _Vino Tinto_ (Tent of Hungary) the Italian\r\n_Montefiascone_, the Persian _Schiras_, the _Malmsey wines of Candia_,\r\n_Chio_, _Lesbos_, and _Tenedos_, and those of the other islands of the\r\nArchipelago. The wines of the ancients, as Chaptal observes, were so\r\nconcentrated by boiling, that they rather deserve the name of extracts\r\nor syrups, than that of wines; they, must have been very sweet, and but\r\nlittle fermented; apparently to remedy this, they were kept for a great\r\nlength of time; according to Aristotle and Galen, seven years was the\r\nshortest period necessary for keeping wine before it was fit to drink,\r\nbut wines of a century old were not uncommon at the tables of the\r\nluxurious citizens of ancient Rome, and Horace boasts of his drinking\r\n_Falernian_, born as it were with him, or which reckoned its age from\r\nthe same consuls.[703]\r\n\r\n2. SPARKLING OR EFFERVESCING WINES, as Champagne, are indebted for their\r\ncharacteristic properties to the presence of carbonic acid; they rapidly\r\nintoxicate, in consequence of the alcohol, which is suspended in, or\r\ncombined with the gas, being thus applied in a sudden and very divided\r\nstate to a large extent of nervous surface; for the same reason, their\r\neffects are as transitory as they are sudden.[704]\r\n\r\n3. DRY AND LIGHT. These are exemplified by the more esteemed German\r\nwines, as _Hock_, _Rhenish_, _Mayne_, _Moselle_, _Necker_, and _Elsass_,\r\nand those highly flavoured wines, _Burgundy_, _Claret_, _Hermitage_, &c.\r\nThey contain a very inconsiderable degree of ardent spirit, and combine\r\nwith it the effect of an acid.\r\n\r\n4. DRY AND STRONG, as _Madeira_, _Port_, _Sherry_, &c. The name _Sec_,\r\ncorruptly written Sack, signifies dry; the _Sec_ wine prepared at\r\nXeres[705] in Spain, is called according to our orthography, _Sherris_,\r\nor _Sherry_. In the manufacture of Sherry, _Lime_[706] is added to the\r\ngrapes, a circumstance, observes Dr. Macculloch, apparently conducive to\r\nits well known dry quality, and which probably acts by neutralizing a\r\nportion of _malic_ or _tartaric_ acid.\r\n\r\nBy the adulteration and medication of wines, three principal objects are\r\nattempted, viz. 1. _To give them strength_, which is effected by adding\r\nany ardent spirit; but the wine is slowly decomposed by it. 2. _To\r\nperfect or change their colour._ It is very usual to change _white_\r\nwines, when they have grown brown or rough, into _red_ wines, by means\r\nof sloes, or other colouring matter. 3. _To lessen, or remove their\r\nacidity._ It is well known that lead in different forms has frequently\r\nbeen employed for this purpose; the practice, however, is attended with\r\nmost dangerous consequences; but which Dr. Macculloch is inclined to\r\nbelieve has been over-rated, since the compounds which this metal forms\r\nwith the tartaric and malic acids are insoluble; but against this\r\nargument, the decisive results of experience may be opposed, and\r\nFourcroy conceived that by the addition of Vinegar, a soluble triple\r\nsalt, an _aceto-tartrate_ of lead, was produced. The fraud may be easily\r\ndetected by the test[707] invented by Dr. Hahnemann. The ancients, it\r\nappears, were acquainted with this property in lead, for according to\r\nPliny, the Greeks and Romans improved the quality of their wines by\r\nimmersing a plate of lead in them.[708] Wine, as a pharmaceutical agent,\r\nhas been employed to extract several of the principles of vegetables,\r\nand to dissolve certain mineral bodies: as a solvent, however, it is\r\nliable to many serious objections, as inequality of strength, and\r\nuncertainty of composition; thus sound and perfectly fermented dry wine,\r\nas _Sherry_, is frequently unable to dissolve iron, while tartarized\r\nantimony is instantly decomposed by every other. As a menstruum, to\r\nobtain an extract, it is quite inadmissible on account of the residuum\r\nwhich it leaves by evaporation. From such considerations the London\r\nCollege have at length substituted a weak spirit, for the wine formerly\r\nemployed, although the term “_Vinum_” is still retained in the\r\nPharmacopœia, to obviate those embarrassments which must ever attend a\r\nchange of name, with a corresponding change of properties. The Committee\r\nwere fully prepared to expect the captious objections which are urged\r\nagainst this measure, but as the name is _chemically_ and _medicinally_\r\ncorrect, the etymologist may be fairly allowed to enjoy his assumed\r\ntriumph without molestation.\r\n\r\nVINUM ALOES. L.E.D. This solution contains all the virtues of the Aloes,\r\nand is more agreeable than the tincture. It is a warm stomachic in doses\r\nof fʒj to fʒij, and a stimulating purgative when given from f℥j to f℥ij.\r\n\r\nBy referring to the Pharmacopœia, it will be perceived that alcoholic\r\nmenstrua of different strengths, have been employed for the different\r\npreparations. The proportions were deduced from careful experiments, and\r\nare adapted to the composition of the substances which the spirit is\r\nintended to dissolve: _e. g._\r\n\r\n                                     Proof Spirit. Water.\r\n              Vinum Aloes            1 part        1.\r\n              —— Antimonii Tartariz: 1 ditto[709]  1.\r\n              —— Colchici            1 ditto       2.\r\n              —— Ferri               1 ditto       1½.\r\n              —— Ipecacuanhæ         1 ditto       1⅔.\r\n              —— Opii                1 ditto       1⅔.\r\n              —— Veratri             1 ditto       1½.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    VINUM ANTIMONII TARTARIZATI. L.\r\n\r\n                LIQUOR ANTIMONII TARTARIZATI. P.L. 1809.\r\n\r\n                           _Antimonial Wine._\r\n\r\nDuring the period that I was Censor of the College, I took considerable\r\ntrouble, in conjunction with my colleagues, to ascertain the state in\r\nwhich this preparation was to be generally met with in the wholesale and\r\nretail shops of the metropolis. We were satisfied, during our official\r\nvisitations, that where _sound_ Sherry wine had been employed as a\r\nsolvent, an efficient and permanent solution was obtained, and that no\r\nprecipitation of Antimony took place, the sediment which occurred being\r\nmerely _Tartrate of Lime_, an incidental impurity derived from the\r\n_Cream of tartar:_ but in a majority of instances an inferior wine of\r\nBritish manufacture was substituted, in which case the Antimonial Oxyd\r\nwas universally found in a copious precipitate, in combination with\r\nvegetable extractive matter; and I have even seen this decomposition so\r\ncomplete, that the supernatant liquor would not yield any trace of the\r\nantimonial salt. This report has been confirmed by successive Censors,\r\nand the College have accordingly endeavoured to remedy the evil, by\r\nsuperseding the use of wine altogether, and of introducing a spirit of\r\nequivalent strength. The virtues of this solution are those detailed\r\nunder the history of _Antimonium Tartarizatum_; of which two grains are\r\ncontained in every fluid-ounce of the preparation. The Medicinal\r\nDynameter will shew the proportion of salt in any other given quantity.\r\nDOSE, ♏︎x to fʒj, in any suitable vehicle, repeated every three or four\r\nhours, in which case it acts as a diaphoretic. As an emetic, it may be\r\ngiven to infants in the dose of a tea-spoonful, every ten minutes, until\r\nthe desired effect is produced. See _Form: 69_, and 117.[710]\r\n\r\nVINUM COLCHICI. This medicated wine is made as follows: Take of the\r\nrecent bulb of the Colchicum, sliced and bruised, [pound]j; of Proof\r\nSpirit, f℥iv; of water, f℥viij; let them infuse for fourteen days, and\r\nfilter for use. There is perhaps no form better calculated to ensure the\r\nmedical effects of the plant than the one we are now considering. Its\r\ndose may be stated to be from ♏︎xx to fʒiss. The virtues of Colchicum\r\nhave been already noticed, see _Colchici Radix_.\r\n\r\nVINUM FERRI. L.D. When prepared according to the London College (P.L.\r\n1809.) each pint is stated to contain 22 grains of the red Oxide of\r\nIron; the strength however must in such a case depend upon the quantity\r\nof _tartar_ contained in the wine. Very dry Sherry is frequently\r\nincapable of acting upon the iron until a small proportion of Cream of\r\nTartar be added to it; would it not therefore be adviseable to direct at\r\nonce a given portion of _ferrum tartarizatum_ to be dissolved in wine?\r\nThe Dublin formula is more eligible than that of the former London\r\nPharmacopœia, since it directs the use of _Rhenish_ wine instead of\r\nSherry as a solvent, and iron wire in preference to iron _filings_; this\r\nlast circumstance is important, for the purest iron can only be drawn,\r\nand this is most easily acted upon by the super-tartrate of potass.\r\nThese observations are offered to those who still prefer to make the\r\npreparation with wine. They can have no relation to the present _Vinum\r\nFerri_ of the London College, which is prepared with a weak spirit, and\r\nwhich contains tartrate of potass and iron, with an excess of\r\nsuper-tartrate which supplies the place of the acid contained in the\r\nwine, and ensures the solution of the tartarized iron in the Spirit.\r\nAccording to the experiments of Mr. Phillips, which I have every reason\r\nto believe accurate, the present preparation contains less peroxide of\r\niron than the former did; it will be seen by the Dynameter that f℥j\r\ncontains exactly one grain, which is exactly equivalent to five grains\r\nof Tartarized Iron, whereas an equal quantity of the former wine held in\r\nsolution 1–4/10 gr, which was equivalent to seven grains of the salt.\r\n_Med. Uses._ It is the least unpleasant of all the preparations of iron,\r\nand its medicinal activity is supported by the testimony of ages, for it\r\nis one of the oldest preparations with which we are acquainted. _Dose_,\r\nfʒij to f℥ss.\r\n\r\nVINUM IPECACUANHÆ. L.E.D. The virtues of this root are completely\r\nextracted by dilute spirit. _Dose_, as an emetic, from fʒij to f℥ss: as\r\na diaphoretic, from ♏︎xx to xl. _See Form. 63, 137._\r\n\r\nVINUM OPII. L.E.[711] This is a spirituous solution of the _extract_ of\r\nOpium combined with various aromatics, which are supposed to modify the\r\neffects of the opium, while by the substitution of the extract for the\r\ncrude opium, it is considered as being less likely to disturb the\r\nnervous system. I submit whether the views offered under the history of\r\nWine, respecting the relative effects of combined and uncombined\r\nAlcohol, might not lead us, by analogy, to prepare a more efficient\r\n_vinum opii_, and a preparation less likely to affect the stomach: by\r\nadding the opium to the wine during its state of fermentation, it would\r\nenter into intimate union with its elements, in the same way that brandy\r\nis incorporated by the technical manipulation of _fretting-in:_ this\r\nsuggestion is also sanctioned by the generally acknowledged superiority\r\nof the _Black Drop_, which I have little doubt is indebted for its\r\npeculiar efficacy to the state of combination in which the _acetate of\r\nmorphia_ exists in the vinous menstruum. The preparation, when made with\r\nwine, as directed in the late Pharmacopœia, is nearly analogous to the\r\ncelebrated _Liquid Laudanum_[712] of Sydenham, and its degree of\r\nnarcotic power is nearly the same as that of the ordinary tincture, as\r\nmay be seen by referring to the _Medicinal Dynameter_.\r\n\r\nVINUM VERATRI. L. Since the discovery of the real nature of the _Eau\r\nMedicinale_, this preparation has fallen into comparative disuse, and\r\nmight have been removed, as we have now introduced the _Vinum Colchici_.\r\nIt is however a singular circumstance that both these preparations\r\nshould owe their medicinal powers to the same elementary principle, viz.\r\n_Veratria_; and as some practitioners are still addicted to its use, the\r\nCommittee agreed to let it remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ULMI CORTEX. L.E.D. (Ulmus Campestris.)\r\n\r\n                              _Elm Bark._\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, none; _Taste_, slightly bitter and mucilaginous.\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Gum, extractive, gallic acid, and super-tartrate\r\nof potass. SOLUBILITY. Water is its appropriate solvent. MED. USES. It\r\nhas been commended in herpetic eruptions, but in the hands of Dr. Willan\r\nand others it has not proved successful; it is one of those articles\r\nthat might be discarded from our Pharmacopœia with much propriety.\r\nOFFICINAL PREP. _Decoct: Ulmi_. L.D.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     UNGUENTA. L.E.D. _Ointments._\r\n\r\nThese are unctuous substances analogous to _Cerates_ except in\r\nconsistence, which is much less firm, and scarcely exceeds that of\r\nbutter: formerly, ointments were numerous and complicated in their\r\ncomposition, and surgeons adapted with much technical formality\r\ndifferent ointments to answer different indications: this practice\r\nhowever has undergone a very judicious reform, and it is now well\r\nunderstood that _in general_ all that is required in an ointment is a\r\nsuitable tenacity and consistence, to keep the parts to which it may be\r\napplied soft and easy, and at the same time to exclude from them the\r\natmospheric air; in some cases, however, these simple compositions are\r\nmade the _vehicles_ of more active remedies, as in the following\r\npreparations, _viz._\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM CANTHARIDIS. L. As the active ingredient in this ointment is\r\nderived from an infusion of the Cantharides, it is extremely mild, and\r\nfrequently inefficacious. The _ceratum cantharidis_ furnishes a more\r\ncertain application.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM ELEMI COMPOSITUM. L. The elemi and turpentine in this\r\nointment, render it stimulant and digestive.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI FORTIUS. L. The precise nature[713] of this\r\ncompound does not appear to have been known until the late\r\nresearches[714] of Mr. Donovan, (_Annals of Philosophy_, _November,\r\n1819_,) which promise to lead to a more uniform, efficacious, and\r\neconomical mode of preparing it; for they[715] shew that in the\r\nofficinal ointment, the mercury exists in two different conditions,—in\r\nthe state of metal, _mechanically mixed_, as asserted by Vogel, and in\r\nthat of an oxide, _chemically combined_ with the lard, and that the\r\nmedicinal activity of the ointment exclusively resides in this latter\r\nportion, the presence of metallic mercury not only being useless but\r\ninjurious, by obstructing the absorption of the active compound of the\r\noxide. Mr. Donovan accordingly formed a direct chemical combination, by\r\ncontinually agitating together lard and black oxide of mercury at the\r\ntemperature of 350° _Fah:_ for two hours. At the end of the process it\r\nappeared that every ounce of lard had dissolved, and combined with 21\r\ngrains of oxide; and from the trials which have been made respecting its\r\nactivity, it would seem to be as efficient as the officinal ointment,\r\nand moreover that it may be introduced by inunction in one third of the\r\ntime. The investigation is highly important, for it not only offers the\r\nmeans of preparing a mercurial ointment more œconomically, but one more\r\nactive and manageable, and less liable to that want of uniformity in\r\nstrength, which must always attend a preparation in which so much labour\r\nis required for its completion; for independent of that variation in\r\nstrength which will arise from imperfect triture, it is by no means an\r\nuncommon practice to use chemical means, which are not admissible, to\r\nfacilitate the process, such as the addition of _Sulphur_, which is\r\nfound to abridge very considerably the labour requisite for the\r\nextinction of the mercury, but it converts a portion of the metal into a\r\n_Sulphuret_, and diminishes the power of the unguent. There is however a\r\nmethod of facilitating the process, which is not liable to any apparent\r\nobjection, but the theory of its operation is obscure; it consists in\r\nadding to the half-prepared ointment a portion of that which has been\r\nlong kept; which appears to act as a _leaven_ to the whole mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table exhibits the relative quantity of mercury contained\r\nin each of the different ointments directed by the British Pharmacopœia,\r\nand in that prepared according to the process of Donovan.\r\n\r\n   One Drachm      { _stronger ointment_ contains of Mercury 30  grs.\r\n     of the Lond:  { _weaker ointment_                       10  ——\r\n     of the Edinb:   _common ointment_                       12  ——\r\n     of the Dub:   { _stronger ointment_                     30  ——\r\n                   { _weaker ointment_                       20  ——\r\n     of that prepared according to Donovan                   2½  ——\r\n\r\nMercurial ointment furnishes the most prompt, and least exceptionable\r\nmode of impregnating the system. The external method of administering\r\nmercury, says Mr. John Hunter, is always preferable to the internal,\r\nbecause the skin is not nearly so essential to life as the stomach, and\r\ntherefore is capable in itself of bearing much more than the stomach.\r\nThe inunction is generally performed by rubbing ʒss to ʒj on some part\r\nof the body where the cuticle is thin, generally on the inside of the\r\nthigh, except perhaps in cases of chronic hepatitis, when it is more\r\nusually applied to the region of the liver, care being taken that the\r\nfriction is continued until every particle of the ointment disappears;\r\nand for obvious reasons, the operation ought if practicable to be\r\nperformed by the patient himself. Where it has been an object to\r\nsaturate the system with mercury as quickly as possible, I have\r\nwitnessed the advantage of confining, by means of slips of bladder, a\r\ndrachm of mercurial ointment in each axilla, in addition to the\r\nmercurial friction. Camphor, turpentine, and other stimulants, have been\r\nsometimes added to the ointment, with a view of promoting its\r\nabsorption; this however is an erroneous practice, since these acrid\r\ningredients soon produce pustules on the skin, which prevent the\r\ncontinuance of the friction; the warm bath is a more certain, and less\r\nobjectionable _adjuvant_, many practitioners therefore advise the body\r\nto be immersed in a warm bath, once and again, before the course is\r\ncommenced, and to repeat it once or twice a week during its continuance:\r\nthe length of time to be employed in a course of mercury, and the\r\nquantity to be given, are circumstances that must in every case be left\r\nto the discretion of the practitioner. Mercury, when introduced into the\r\nbody, acts as a powerful stimulant, and pervades every part of the\r\nsystem; hence it is the most powerful evacuant belonging to the Materia\r\nMedica; from its stimulant operation, exerted directly or indirectly, we\r\nare able to explain its utility in the cure of disease, and it may be\r\nmade to act according to management and circumstances, as a tonic,\r\nantispasmodic, diuretic, cathartic, sialogogue, emmenagogue, or\r\nalterative; but its most important operation is that displayed in\r\nremoving the diseases induced by the syphilitic poison, although its\r\n_modus operandi_ is still buried amongst the many other arcana of\r\nphysic. The mode of directing and controlling the influence of mercury\r\nin the cure of the venereal disease, is now very generally understood,\r\nand it is to be hoped that a full confidence in its antisyphilitic\r\npowers is as universally maintained, in spite of the late opinions which\r\ntended to depreciate its value and to question its necessity; there is\r\nhowever no advantage to be gained, as was once imagined, by exciting\r\nprofuse salivation. On its next important application, that of curing\r\nchronic affections of the liver and dropsy, a remark which has been\r\nsuggested to me by the results of practice, may not be unacceptable. I\r\nthink I have generally observed, that when the remedy has been pushed to\r\nsuch an extent as to excite the salivary glands to excessive secretion,\r\nthe urinary organs cease to participate in its stimulating action, and\r\n_vice versa_, for the mouth is rarely affected when the mercury runs off\r\nby the kidneys; this may suggest a precaution of some practical moment\r\nin the treatment of dropsy, and it will be generally judicious to\r\naccompany the administration of this metal with certain diuretics, in\r\norder to direct its operation to the kidneys;[716] and it would seem,\r\nthat for such an object those diuretic medicines should be preferred\r\nthat act _primarily_ on the organs, as alkalies and their combinations,\r\nsquill, &c. the success of such a plan of treatment will also depend\r\ngreatly upon the exact period at which these remedies are administered;\r\nit will for instance be right to wait until the system is, to a certain\r\ndegree, under mercurial influence. It is hardly necessary to observe,\r\nthat if the mercury runs off by the bowels, we shall be deprived of all,\r\nor of a great share of, the benefit to be expected. In certain cases,\r\nthe lymphatic vessels seem to resist the admittance of mercury, and to\r\nrefuse the conveyance of it to the general circulation: I have already\r\nthrown out some vague hints upon the subject, at page 156, and I must\r\nrefer the reader to some farther remarks, which I apprehend bear upon\r\nthis question under the following article.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM OXIDI HYDRARGYRI CINEREI. E. This consists of a mixture of\r\n_one part_ of grey oxide of mercury, and _three parts_ of axunge: it was\r\nreasonable to suppose, _a priori_, that, as the whole of the mercury in\r\nthis ointment is oxidized, its adoption would supersede the necessity of\r\nthe labour required for the preparation of the common mercurial\r\nointment, and at the same time afford a combination of equal if not\r\nsuperior efficacy; but experience has not justified the conclusion, for\r\nit has been found to possess little or no activity; the consideration of\r\nit is therefore introduced into this work, not on account of its\r\nutility, but as an object upon which I may pause with advantage, to\r\noffer those observations which its history is so well calculated to call\r\nforth and illustrate. The circumstance which renders this preparation\r\ninert, will now receive a satisfactory explanation from the experiments\r\nof Mr. Donovan, as related in the preceding article; in short, it is a\r\n_mechanical mixture_ instead of a _chemical combination_; and I beg\r\nagain to urge the importance of this distinction, and to offer the\r\npresent example as a farther illustration of the views I have already\r\nsubmitted upon the subject. By subjecting this ointment for some hours\r\nto a heat of 300°, it would without doubt become an active preparation.\r\nIt is probable that the lymphatics offers less resistance to the ingress\r\nof a mineral body into the system when it is presented to them in\r\ncombination with some animal substance, which must alone be regarded as\r\ntheir peculiar stimulus, and the only matter which they are destined\r\nperpetually to receive and convey; for the same physiological reason,\r\nthe lacteals may probably take up iron with greater readiness when in\r\ncombination with vegetable matter, than when introduced into the stomach\r\nin a more purely mineral form.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI MITIUS. L. This weaker preparation is sometimes\r\npreferred, as it irritates the skin less; it is however principally used\r\nas a topical dressing to venereal sores, and as an application to kill\r\nvermin on the body.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI NITRATIS. L.E.D. vulgo _Citrine Ointment_. It is\r\nstimulant, detergent, and alterative; when diluted with an equal\r\nquantity of simple ointment or almond oil, it may be almost regarded as\r\na specific in ophthalmia tarsi, smeared upon the cilia every night at\r\nbedtime.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI NITRICO-OXYDI. L. An excellent stimulant\r\napplication, well adapted for giving energy to indolent ulcers. If mixed\r\nwith any ointment containing resin, it loses its red colour, passing\r\nthrough olive green to black, which depends upon the conversion of the\r\n_red_ into the _black_ oxide of mercury.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM HYDRARGYRI PRÆCIPITATI ALBI. L. Stimulant and detergent. It is\r\nsaid to be very efficacious in certain inveterate forms of the Itch.\r\nWith the addition of Carbonate of Potass, it has been much extolled in\r\nvarious cutaneous affections.[717]\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM PICIS LIQUIDÆ. L.E.D. _Tar Ointment._ This ointment has been\r\nmuch extolled for the removal of tetter, and for the cure of tinea\r\ncapitis.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM RESINÆ NIGRÆ. L. olim, _Ung. Basilicum[718] nigrum._ Digestive\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM SAMBUCI. L.D. It possesses no advantage over the simple\r\nointment.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM SULPHURIS. L.E.D. This ointment is a mechanical mixture of\r\nLard and Sulphur, although it would appear that a small proportion of\r\nthe latter exists also in a state of chemical combination. MED. USES. A\r\nspecific in the itch. Dr. Bateman proposes a combination, equally\r\nefficacious, but which has not the same disagreeable smell; _viz_. “Take\r\nof sub-carbonate of potass, _half an ounce_; rose water, _one ounce_;\r\nred sulphuret of mercury, _one drachm_; essential oil of Bergamot, half\r\na _fluid-drachm_; sublimed sulphur, hog’s lard, of each _eleven ounces_.\r\nMix them.” Jasser’s Ointment also, as altered in the Prussian\r\nPharmacopœia, is an excellent application in Psora, _viz._ ℞._Sulphur:\r\nSublim:_ ℥ij, _Zinci Sulphat:_ ℥ij, _Ol:_ _Lauri, et Axung. q, s, ut\r\nfiat Unguentum_.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM SULPHURIS COMPOSITUM. L. More stimulating than the simple\r\nointment, from the addition of white hellebore; it is however frequently\r\nfound to excite too much irritation.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM VERATRI. L.D. It is used for the cure of scabies, but is less\r\ncertain than the ointment of sulphur.\r\n\r\nUNGUENTUM ZINCI. L.E.D. Astringent and stimulant; very beneficial in\r\nsome species of ophthalmia, smeared upon the tarsi, every night.\r\n\r\nVery efficient preparations may be also constructed by adding together\r\nequal weights of lard and narcotic vegetable powders, as those of\r\n_Conium_, _Digitalis_, _Belladonna_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe addition of a small quantity of powdered white sugar will frequently\r\nprevent ointments becoming rancid.\r\n\r\n\r\n               UVÆ URSI FOLIA. L.E.D (Arbŭtus Uva Ursi.)\r\n\r\n            _Uva Ursi_, _Bear-berry_, or _Trailing Arbutus_.\r\n\r\n             _Bear’s Whortle-berry_, _Wild Cranberry_, &c.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Odour_, slight, resembling that of hyson tea; _Taste_,\r\nbitterish and sub-astringent. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Tannin, mucilage,\r\ngallic acid, extractive, resin, and traces of lime. SOLUBILITY. Both\r\nwater and alcohol extract its virtues. MED. USES. The ancients employed\r\nit on account of its astringency, the moderns however have exhibited it\r\nfor various diseases, more especially for those affecting the bladder\r\nand urinary organs, and, it would seem, without any theory respecting\r\nits _modus operandi_; but it has at length fallen into disrepute, and\r\nprobably with justice: it occasionally renders the urine of a blackish\r\ncolour, a fact which is not easy to be explained. When it is\r\nadministered, the form of powder is preferred, and in doses from ℈j to\r\nʒj. The leaves of the _Vaccinium Vitis Idæa_ (Red Whortle-berry,) are\r\nsometimes substituted for those of _Uvæ Ursi_; but they may be easily\r\ndistinguished; _botanically_, by the net work appearance of their veins\r\nabove, and by their dots underneath; _chemically_, by their infusion\r\nneither precipitating the solution of isinglass, nor that of sulphate of\r\niron.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          ZINCI OXYDUM. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n                            _Oxide of Zinc._\r\n\r\nThis is occasionally used internally as a tonic, and may be exhibited in\r\nthe form of pill. It is however principally employed externally, as a\r\nmild but efficient astringent; viz. _Ung: Zinci_. ADULTERATIONS. Dr.\r\nRoloff of Magdeburg has lately discovered the casual presence of\r\n_Arsenic_[719] in this oxide; by boiling the substance in distilled\r\nwater, and assaying the solution with the ammoniaco-nitrate of silver,\r\nits presence may be instantly recognised; _Chalk_ may be detected by\r\nsulphuric acid exciting an effervescence; and _White Lead_, by its\r\nforming an insoluble sulphate of lead. It ought to be volatile.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         ZINCI SULPHAS. L.E.D.\r\n\r\n               _Sulphate of Zinc_, olim, _White Vitriol_.\r\n\r\nQUALITIES. _Form_, crystals, which are four-sided prisms, terminated by\r\nfour-sided pyramids; they are slightly efflorescent; _Taste_, styptic,\r\nmetallic, and slightly acidulous. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION. One proportional\r\nof oxide, and one proportional of acid; its crystals contain seven\r\nproportionals of water. SOLUBILITY. It is soluble in 2.5 times its\r\nweight of water at 60°, and in less than its own weight of boiling\r\nwater, but is quite insoluble in alcohol. INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES.\r\n_Alkalies_; _earths_; _hydro-sulphurets_; _astringent vegetable\r\ninfusions_; _Milk_. MED. USES. Tonic, astringent, and, in large doses\r\nemetic, (_Form. 66._) As an emetic it operates directly, and offers\r\ntherefore a prompt resource in cases of poison, or where an immediate\r\ndischarge from the stomach is required; it appears to differ from most\r\nremedies of this nature, in not proving diaphoretic in smaller doses: in\r\nspasmodic[720] coughs it is administered with the best effects,\r\nespecially when combined with camphor or myrrh, (_Form. 59:_) in\r\naffections of the chest attended with inordinate secretion, I have\r\nwitnessed much benefit from its exhibition, particularly when presented\r\nin the form of lozenge; and, when dissolved in water, in the proportion\r\nof grs. ij to f℥j, it forms a useful injection in fluor albus, &c.; in\r\nsmall doses its internal exhibition is also useful in Leucorrhæa. When\r\ncombined with opium it is well calculated to obviate that atony, and\r\nthose frequent discharges of fæces, without pain, that take place in the\r\nprotracted stages of dysentery. As an external application it is very\r\ngenerally employed in the proportion of grs. x to eight fluid-ounces of\r\nwater. The supposed ill effects consequent on the application of\r\npreparations of lead to a great surface, have determined some\r\npractitioners to substitute in their place, solutions of sulphate of\r\nzinc, but not with the same effect; for to that very property, which may\r\noccasionally render saturnine lotions dangerous, is their virtue to be\r\nattributed; see _Liquor Plumbi Sub-acetatis_. DOSE, as an emetic from\r\ngrs. x. to ʒss—as a tonic, and astringent, from grs. j. to ij. OFFICINAL\r\nPREP. _Liquor: Alum: comp:_ L. (=B=) _Solutio Sulphatis Zinci._ _Solutio\r\nAcetatis Zinci._ E. (=I=). _Tinct: Acetatis Zinci_. D. (=I=).\r\nADULTERATIONS. The _white vitriol_ of commerce ought never to be used in\r\nmedicine without previous purification, since it generally contains the\r\nsulphates of copper and iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n       ZINGIBERIS RADIX. L.E.D. (Zingiber Officinale.) _Ginger_.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION. Volatile oil, fecula, and resino-extractive\r\nmatter; on the first of these principles its well known flavour and\r\nodour depend; but its pungency resides in the last. SOLUBILITY. Water,\r\nalcohol, and æther, extract its virtues. MED. USES. It is highly\r\nstimulant and is therefore frequently beneficial in flatulant cholic,\r\ndyspepsia, and gout; it is however more generally employed as an adjunct\r\nto other remedies, to promote their efficacy or to correct their\r\noperation, (see _Form. 92, 94, 112, 153_,) and it is found, that it does\r\nnot produce the ill effects of those spices, whose virtues reside in an\r\nacrid oil.

Europe. That collected by\r\n  Dr. Burgess, and presented to the College after his death by Mr.\r\n  Brande, to whom it was bequeathed, has lately been collated with the\r\n  cabinet of Dr. Coombe, purchased for that purpose. Its arrangement has\r\n  been directed by a feeling of convenience for reference, rather than\r\n  by any theoretical views relative to the natural, chemical, and\r\n  medicinal histories of its constituent parts. Under proper\r\n  regulations, it is accessible to the studious and respectable members\r\n  of the profession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  A late foreign writer impressed with this sentiment has given the\r\n  following flattering definition of our profession. ‘Physic is the art\r\n  of amusing the patient, while Nature cures the disease.’ This is a\r\n  sarcasm which can only be equalled by the churlish and ill-humoured\r\n  apostrophe of our own Dr. Samuel Johnson, who, in speaking of the\r\n  profession of physic, exclaims ‘It is a melancholy attendance on\r\n  misery; a mean submission to peevishness; and a continual interruption\r\n  of pleasure.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Observation, says professor Leslie, is the close inspection and\r\n  attentive examination of those phenomena which arise in the course of\r\n  Nature; Experiment, as the term implies, consists in a kind of trial,\r\n  or artificial selection and combination of circumstances, for the\r\n  purpose of searching after the remote results.\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The refractive power of an inflammable body bears also a proportion to\r\n  its perfection, whence it may be sometimes used as a test of its\r\n  purity; thus Dr. Wollaston found that genuine Oil of Cloves had a\r\n  refractive power of 1.535, while that of an inferior quality did not\r\n  exceed 1.498.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  Elizabeth Woodcock, who was buried in the snow for the space of eight\r\n  days, in the neighbourhood of Cambridge, and whom I frequently\r\n  visited, died in consequence of the stimulants which she could not\r\n  resist, and which in her peculiar state of excitement she was unable\r\n  to bear. In the first volume of the Memoirs of the Philosophical\r\n  Society of Manchester, a case of a Miner is recorded, who after\r\n  remaining for eight days without food, was killed by being placed in a\r\n  warm bed, and fed with chicken-broth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  For this purpose it appears that the toad was baked alive. The\r\n  following is the receipt in Colborne’s Dispensatory; ‘Bufo\r\n  Præparatus.’ “Put the toads alive into an earthen pot, and dry them in\r\n  an oven moderately heated, till they become fit to be powdered.”!\r\n\r\nFootnote 7:\r\n\r\n  The application of the reeking entrails of a recently slain animal,\r\n  appears to have been one of the earliest methods adopted for the\r\n  relief of pain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 8:\r\n\r\n  The words ‘Incantation,’ and ‘Charm,’ appear to have been derived from\r\n  the ancient practice of curing diseases by Poetry and Music. (Carmen)\r\n  Thus Cœlius Aurelianus, decantare loca Dolentia. Democritus says that\r\n  many diseases are capable of being cured by the sound of a flute, when\r\n  properly played. Marianus Capellus assures us, that fevers may be\r\n  cured by appropriate songs; Asclepiades actually employed the trumpet,\r\n  for the relief of Sciatica, and tells us that it is to be continued\r\n  until the fibres of the part begin to palpitate, when the pain will\r\n  vanish.\r\n\r\nFootnote 9:\r\n\r\n  similar superstition is still practised by the Indians. There is a\r\n  species of green jasper found in many parts of America, particularly\r\n  in New Spain, to which the Spaniards have given the name of Piedra de\r\n  la Hyada, and is used for curing the Cholic by being applied to the\r\n  navel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 10:\r\n\r\n  Lib. viii. c. 2. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 11:\r\n\r\n  From this Art of Solomon, exhibited through the medium of a ring, or\r\n  seal, we have the eastern stories which celebrate the SEAL OF SOLOMON,\r\n  and record the potency of its sway over the various orders of Demons,\r\n  or of Genii, who are supposed to be the invisible tormentors or\r\n  benefactors of the human race.\r\n\r\nFootnote 12:\r\n\r\n  Let the tradition respecting the discovery of the virtues of the bark\r\n  serve as an illustration. We are told, that an Indian being ill of a\r\n  fever, quenched his thirst at a pool of water, strongly impregnated\r\n  with the bark from some trees having accidentally fallen into it, and\r\n  that he was in consequence cured.\r\n\r\nFootnote 13:\r\n\r\n  As these persons were ambitious to pass for the descendants of\r\n  Esculapius, they assumed the name of The ASCLEPIADES. The writings of\r\n  Pausanius, Philostratus, and Plutarch, abound with the artifices of\r\n  those early physicians. Aristophanes describes in a truly comic manner\r\n  the craft and pious avarice of these godly men, and mentions the\r\n  dexterity and promptitude with which they collected, and put into\r\n  their bags, the offerings on the altar. The patients, during this\r\n  period, reposed on the skins of sacrificed rams, in order that they\r\n  might procure celestial visions. As soon as they were believed to be\r\n  asleep, a priest, clothed in the dress of Esculapius, imitating his\r\n  manners, and accompanied by the daughters of the god, that is, by\r\n  young actresses, thoroughly instructed in their parts, entered, and\r\n  delivered a medical opinion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 14:\r\n\r\n  Odyss Δ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 15:\r\n\r\n  Hence, the Tincture of Opium has been called _Thebaic_ Tincture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 16:\r\n\r\n  The Laurel was sacred to Apollo, with plantations of which his temples\r\n  were surrounded. Lucan informs us (Pharsal. lib. v.) that the speedy\r\n  death of the priestess was often occasioned by the ceremony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 17:\r\n\r\n  Allusions to this plant frequently occur in the medical writings of\r\n  antiquity; we are told that Galen, in the decline of life, suffered\r\n  much from morbid vigilance, until he had recourse to eating a lettuce\r\n  every evening, which cured him.\r\n\r\nFootnote 18:\r\n\r\n  Iliad Δ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 19:\r\n\r\n  The Plague of London was supposed to have arisen from such a cause, as\r\n  we learn from the writers of that period. I shall quote a passage from\r\n  a pamphlet by W. Kemp, M. A. dedicated to Charles the Second. ‘One\r\n  cause of breeding the pestilence is that corruption of the air, which\r\n  is occasioned by the influence of the Stars, by the aspects,\r\n  conjunctions, and oppositions of the Planets, by the eclipses of the\r\n  Sun and Moon, and by the consequences of Comets.’ ‘Astra regunt\r\n  homines, sed regit astra Deus.’ Hippocrates advises his son Thessalus\r\n  to study numbers and geometry, (‘Epist. ad Thessalum.’) because, says\r\n  he, the rising and setting of the Stars have a great effect upon\r\n  Distempers. Citois, the historian of the celebrated Colic of Poitou\r\n  (Colica Pictonum), which raged with such epidemic fury in that\r\n  province during the Sixteenth century, drops a hint, apparently with a\r\n  view to account for the origin of the disease, viz. that to the great\r\n  astonishment of Astrologers, ‘a new Star had, in the same year made\r\n  its appearance in the constellation of Cassiopeia’.—(Diatriba de novo\r\n  et populari, apud Pictones, dolore colico bilioso.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 20:\r\n\r\n  The precious stones were, at first, only used as Amulets, or external\r\n  charms, but like many other articles of the Materia Medica, they\r\n  passed, by a mistake in the mode of their application, from the\r\n  outside to the inside of the body, and they were accordingly powdered\r\n  and administered as specifics. An analogous case of the perverted\r\n  administration of a popular remedy is afforded in the history of the\r\n  Tench; which Sennertus describes as a remedy capable of curing the\r\n  Jaundice, which he allows is effected ‘by secret attraction, and the\r\n  power of Amulets.’ In the course of time, it became a reputed food in\r\n  the cure of that disease, and Tench broth was prescribed upon all such\r\n  occasions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 21:\r\n\r\n  Mystery is the very soul of Empiricism; withdraw the veil, and the\r\n  confidence of the patient instantly languishes; thus Pliny, ‘Minus\r\n  credunt quæ ad suam salutem pertinent, si intelligunt.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 22:\r\n\r\n  It was this historian who said, that Medicine was invented by Apollo,\r\n  improved by Esculapius, and brought to perfection by the physician of\r\n  Cos.\r\n\r\nFootnote 23:\r\n\r\n  Paracelsus exclaims, ‘Stellas terrenes esse Plantas, quæ celestes\r\n  plantas, i. e. Stellas, respiciant, ita ut quævis planta suam habeat\r\n  stellam specificam.’\r\n\r\n  The Druids of Gaul and Britain, who were both priests and physicians,\r\n  gathered and cut the _Missletoe_ with a golden knife, only when the\r\n  Moon was six days old, and being afterwards consecrated by certain\r\n  forms, it was considered as an antidote to poisons, and a preventive\r\n  of sterility. Plinii. Lib. xvi, c. 44.\r\n\r\n  The _Vervain_, (Verbena Officinalis,) after libations of honey, was to\r\n  be gathered at the rising of the dog-star, when neither sun nor moon\r\n  shone, with the left hand only; when thus prepared, it was said to\r\n  vanquish fevers, and other distempers, was an antidote to the bite of\r\n  serpents, and a charm to conciliate friendship. Plin. Lib. xxv. c. 9.\r\n  I shall however hereafter shew that the medicinal reputation of this\r\n  herb derived its origin from a source more ancient even than that of\r\n  Druidism. Magnenus (Exercitat. de Tabaco,) has given us the following\r\n  precept,—‘Tabacum seratur luna _crescente_, colligatur autem\r\n  _decrescente_ luna.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 24:\r\n\r\n  In later times these heathen symbols were dropped, and others were\r\n  adopted to propitiate the favour and assistance of heaven; for this\r\n  purpose the Alchemists stamped the figure of the cross upon the vessel\r\n  in which they were to obtain their long sought for prize; a\r\n  superstitious practice, from which the term _crucible_ derived its\r\n  origin. I am well aware that another explanation has been given, and\r\n  that the word has been derived from _Crucio_, since in the language of\r\n  the Alchemists, the crucible was the vessel in which the metals were\r\n  _tortured_ to force them to assume the form of gold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 25:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Boyle was pre-eminently credulous with respect to _specifics_, and\r\n  contributed very greatly to the encouragement and diffusion of\r\n  empiricism, by publishing many prescriptions as affording infallible\r\n  remedies, which were communicated to him by a variety of persons, who\r\n  either from ignorance or design vouched for their efficacy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 26:\r\n\r\n  The Soothsayers attributed many mystic properties to the Coral, and it\r\n  was believed to be capable of giving protection against the influence\r\n  of ‘_Evil Eyes_;’ it was even supposed that Coral would drive away\r\n  Devils and Evil Spirits; hence arose the custom of wearing amulets\r\n  composed of it, around the neck, and of making crowns of it. Pliny and\r\n  Dioscorides are very loud in their praises of the medicinal properties\r\n  of this substance, and Paracelsus says that it should be worn around\r\n  the necks of infants as an admirable preservative against fits,\r\n  sorcery, charms, and even against poison. It is a curious\r\n  circumstance, that the same superstitious belief should exist among\r\n  the Negroes of the West Indies, who affirm that the colour of Coral is\r\n  always affected by the state of health of the wearer, it becoming\r\n  paler in disease. In Sicily it is also commonly worn as an amulet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 27:\r\n\r\n  See “Sir Kenelm Digby’s Discourse upon the Cure by Sympathy,\r\n  pronounced at Montpellier, before an assembly of Nobles and learned\r\n  men. Translated into English, by R. White, Gentleman, and published in\r\n  1658.” King James the First obtained from Sir Kenelm the discovery of\r\n  his secret, which he pretended had been taught him by a Carmelite\r\n  Friar, who had learned it in America or Persia.\r\n\r\n  The _Sympathetic Powder_ was, as we learn from cotemporary physicians,\r\n  ‘_calcined green vitriol_.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 28:\r\n\r\n  This superstitious practice is repeatedly alluded to by the poets:\r\n  thus Sir Walter Scott, in the Lay of the Last Minstrel—\r\n\r\n    “But she has ta’en the broken lance,\r\n    And wash’d it from the clotted gore,\r\n    And salved the splinter o’er and o’er.\r\n    William of Deloraine, in trance,\r\n    Whene’er she turn’d it round and round,\r\n    Twisted, as if she gall’d his wound,\r\n    Then to her maidens she did say,\r\n    That he should be whole man and sound.”—_Canto_ iii. _St._ xxiii.\r\n\r\n  Dryden has also introduced the same superstition in his Enchanted\r\n  Island. Act. v. Scene ii.\r\n\r\n  _Ariel._ Anoint the sword which pierced him with this\r\n\r\n           Weapon salve, and wrap it close from air\r\n\r\n           Till I have time to visit it again.\r\n\r\n  Again, in Scene 4th, Miranda enters with Hippolito’s sword, wrapt up:—\r\n\r\n    _Hip._ O my wounds pain me,\r\n\r\n                                              [_She unwraps the sword._]\r\n\r\n    _Mir._ I am come to ease you.\r\n\r\n    _Hip._ Alas I feel the cold air come to me; My wound shoots worse\r\n             than ever.\r\n\r\n    _Mir._ Does it still grieve you?\r\n\r\n                                    [_She wipes and anoints the sword._]\r\n\r\n    _Hip._ Now, methinks, there’s something laid just upon it:\r\n\r\n    _Mir._ Do you find no ease?\r\n\r\n    _Hip._ Yes, Yes; upon the sudden all this pain\r\n\r\n           Is leaving me—Sweet heaven, how am I eased!\r\n\r\nFootnote 29:\r\n\r\n  At the same time it must be acknowledged that many of these revolting\r\n  applications have actually produced benefit by a physical operation;\r\n  we need only mention the nauseous remedies recommended by many writers\r\n  on Midwifery to expedite delivery, which induced the desired effect by\r\n  producing nausea, or vomiting. Hartman says (Opera. Fol. p. 72) that\r\n  he has often witnessed amongst the poor, that difficult labour has\r\n  been accelerated by a draught of the husband’s urine! and, he adds,\r\n  that horse dung infused in wine is efficacious in expelling the\r\n  Placenta. Sarah Stone, a midwife who published some cases in 1737,\r\n  mentions several instances of women in labour, to whom was given the\r\n  juice of leeks, mixed with their husband’s urine, in order to\r\n  strengthen the pains. Nauseous remedies have always enjoyed the\r\n  confidence of the vulgar; this prejudice would seem to be the result\r\n  of a species of false reasoning, by no means uncommon, that as every\r\n  thing medicinal is nauseous, so must every thing that is nauseous be\r\n  consequently medicinal.\r\n\r\nFootnote 30:\r\n\r\n  Edward the Confessor was the first English king who _touched_ for the\r\n  Evil, but the foolish superstition has been wisely laid aside ever\r\n  since the accession of the House of Hanover.\r\n\r\nFootnote 31:\r\n\r\n  This superstitious notion is not confined to the ancients, but is even\r\n  cherished at this day, in some of the more remote districts of the\r\n  kingdom; and we find frequent allusions to it in the popular poetry of\r\n  the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n           “Tom Pots was but a serving man,\r\n           But yet he was a doctor good;\r\n           He bound his ’kerchief on the wound,\r\n           And _with some kind words_ he staunch’d the blood.”\r\n\r\n  Sir Walter Scott, in his “Lay of the last Minstrel”—\r\n\r\n               “She drew the splinter from the wound,\r\n               And with a _charm_ she staunch’d the blood.”\r\n\r\n  The reader will also find the enumeration of several charms for this\r\n  purpose, in Reginald Scot’s Discoverie of Witchcraft, p. 273.\r\n\r\n  We learn also from Sennertus, that the older Surgeons had recourse to\r\n  prayers and magic for the extraction of foreign bodies from wounds; a\r\n  very interesting summary of their superstitions, and peculiar notions\r\n  concerning wounds, will be found in this author, under the head, “De\r\n  Rebus alienis e vulnere eximendis.” Lib. v. Pars, iv. Practicæ\r\n  Medicinæ.\r\n\r\nFootnote 32:\r\n\r\n  The reader will find this subject treated more fully in the\r\n  Introduction to our work on “MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  See a Tour through England, by Dr. Nemnich of Hamburgh.\r\n\r\nFootnote 34:\r\n\r\n  _Nostrum_, (our own.) This word, as its original meaning implies, is\r\n  very significant of this characteristic attribute of quackery. See the\r\n  note under the article ‘Liquor Opii Sedativus.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 35:\r\n\r\n  Aristides was the dupe and victim of the Asclepiades for ten\r\n  successive years; he was alternately purged, vomited, and blistered;\r\n  made to walk bare-footed, under a burning sun in summer, and in winter\r\n  he was doomed to seek for the return of health, by bathing his feeble\r\n  and emaciated body in the river. All this severity, he was made to\r\n  believe, was exercised towards him by the express directions of\r\n  Esculapius himself, with whom he was persuaded to fancy that he\r\n  conversed in his dreams, and frequently beheld in nocturnal visions.\r\n  Upon one occasion, the god, fatigued with the importunities of his\r\n  votary, ordered him to lose 120 lbs. of blood; the unhappy man not\r\n  having so much in his body, _wisely_ took the liberty of interpreting\r\n  the oracle in his own way, and parted with no more than he could\r\n  conveniently spare.\r\n\r\nFootnote 36:\r\n\r\n  As we are here investigating the follies of Physic, it will not be\r\n  foreign to the subject to state, that the above observation may with\r\n  as much truth and force be applied to medical writings as to medical\r\n  substances. Nothing is more fatal to the permanent success and\r\n  character of an author, than the extravagant and unmerited encomiums\r\n  of time-serving reviewers. It would be invidious to illustrate this\r\n  truth by examples, or we might adduce some striking instances where\r\n  the inappropriate wreath has strangled the object which it was\r\n  intended to adorn. It is a matter of deep regret that the _Magnates_\r\n  of our profession do not combine in supporting a respectable medical\r\n  Review.—‘Manus Apolline dignum.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 37:\r\n\r\n  This theory is still cherished in the preservation of the formula for\r\n  Pilulæ Opiatæ, in the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 38:\r\n\r\n  The practice of this physician does not appear to have been very\r\n  successful, if we may credit Juvenal.—\r\n\r\n               “Quot Themison ægros autumno occiderit uno.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 39:\r\n\r\n  See ‘An Experimental Enquiry into the effects of Tonics, and other\r\n  Medicines, on the cohesion of the Animal fibre.’ By Dr. Crawford.\r\n\r\nFootnote 40:\r\n\r\n  Van Swieten, in his Commentaries on the Venereal disease, has an\r\n  aphorism founded on the same hypothesis, ‘Render the blood and lymph\r\n  more fluid, and you will have destroyed the virus.’ Sect. 1477.\r\n\r\n  In the first volume of the Transactions of the Royal College of\r\n  Physicians, there is a paper to the same effect, entitled, ‘On the\r\n  Operation of Mercury, in different diseases and constitutions, by\r\n  Edward Barry, M.D. F.R.S.’ Read at the College, July 13, 1767.\r\n\r\nFootnote 41:\r\n\r\n  Genesis ix. 23.\r\n\r\nFootnote 42:\r\n\r\n  The animal nature of the colouring matter of the blood was first\r\n  pointed out by Dr. Wells, but Fourcroy and Vauquelin considered it to\r\n  be owing to subphosphate of iron. Mr. Brande, in 1812, demonstrated\r\n  the fallacy of this opinion, and proved, by satisfactory experiments,\r\n  its title to be considered as a peculiar animal principle; the\r\n  subsequent experiments of M. Vauquelin have confirmed Mr. Brande’s\r\n  results.\r\n\r\nFootnote 43:\r\n\r\n  The Magnet, or Loadstone, in powder, entered also as an ingredient in\r\n  several plaisters, to draw bullets, and heads of arrows, out of the\r\n  body, as in the ‘Emplastrum Divinum Nicolai,’ the ‘Emplastrum Nigrum’\r\n  of Augsburg, the ‘Opodeldock’ and ‘Attractivum,’ of Paracelsus, with\r\n  several other preparations, to be found in the Dispensatory of Wecker,\r\n  and in the practice of Sennertus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 44:\r\n\r\n  PYRETOLOGIA, p. 17, A. D. 1692.\r\n\r\nFootnote 45:\r\n\r\n  Sturmius, in his ‘Febrifugi Peruviani Vindiciæ,’ published in 1658,\r\n  observes that he saw twenty doses of the powder sold at Brussels for\r\n  sixty florins, in order to be sent to Paris, and that he would\r\n  willingly have been a purchaser of some doses, even at that price; but\r\n  the Apothecary was unable to supply him: an anecdote not more\r\n  illustrative of the reputation of the bark, than of the honesty of the\r\n  vender.\r\n\r\nFootnote 46:\r\n\r\n  This produced a pamphlet from Dr. Slare, entitled ‘A Vindication of\r\n  Sugars against the Charge of Dr. Willis and others: dedicated to the\r\n  Ladies.’ 1715.\r\n\r\nFootnote 47:\r\n\r\n  This conceit did not escape the notice of the metaphysical poets of\r\n  the seventeenth century; Cowley frequently availed himself of it to\r\n  embellish his verse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 48:\r\n\r\n  Genesis xxx. 14.\r\n\r\nFootnote 49:\r\n\r\n  This mineral derives its name from the ancient belief that it was\r\n  found in the nest of the eagle.

The popular author of WAVERLEY alludes to this\r\n  superstition in his ABBOT.\r\n\r\nFootnote 53:\r\n\r\n  Massaria, a learned Professor of Pavia in the sixteenth century,\r\n  absolutely declares that he would rather err with Galen than be in the\r\n  right with any other physician!\r\n\r\nFootnote 54:\r\n\r\n  This practice of Bishop Berkeley has been ridiculed with great point\r\n  and effect, in a pamphlet entitled ‘A cure for the Epidemical Madness\r\n  of drinking Tar Water,’ by Mr. Reeve; in which, addressing the Bishop,\r\n  he says, “thus, in your younger days, my Lord, you made the surprising\r\n  discovery of the unreality of matter, and now in your riper age, you\r\n  have undertaken to prove the reality of a universal remedy; an attempt\r\n  to talk men out of their reason, did of right, belong to that author\r\n  who had first tried to persuade them out of their senses.” Tar water\r\n  was also at one period considered to possess very considerable\r\n  efficacy in Syphylis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 55:\r\n\r\n  The Euphrasia Officinalis, or Eye-bright, which is indebted for its\r\n  celebrity to the doctrine of Signatures, as before stated, is actually\r\n  employed at this time in cases of dimness of sight. See a Paper upon\r\n  the efficacy of this plant by Dr. Jackson, in the London Medical and\r\n  Physical Journal, vol. 23, p. 104.\r\n\r\nFootnote 56:\r\n\r\n  Its rejection was proposed by the late Dr. Heberden, and upon the\r\n  College dividing on the question, there were found to be _thirteen_\r\n  votes for retaining, and _fourteen_ for rejecting it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 57:\r\n\r\n  This preparation consists of 72 ingredients, which are arranged under\r\n  13 heads—viz. ACRIA, of which there are 5 species. AMARA, of which\r\n  there are 8. STYPTICA vulgo ASTRINGENTIA, 5 in number. AROMATICA\r\n  EXOTICA, 14. AROMATICA INDIGENA, 10. AROMATICA EX UMBELLIFERIS, 7.\r\n  RESINOSA ET BALSAMA, 8. GRAVE-OLENTIA, 6. VIROSA, _seu quæ Narcosin\r\n  inducunt_, under which head there is but one species, viz. Opium.\r\n  TERREA INSIPIDA ET INERTIA; this comprises only the _Lemnian Earth_.\r\n  GUMMOSA, AMYLACEA, &c. 4 species. DULCIA, _liquorice and honey_.\r\n  VINUM, _Spanish_.\r\n\r\n  Upon no principle of combination can this heterogeneous farrago be\r\n  vindicated. It has, however, enjoyed the confidence of physicians for\r\n  many ages, and is therefore entitled to some notice. It was supposed\r\n  to have been invented by Mithridates, the famous king of Pontus, the\r\n  receipt for which was said to have been found among his papers after\r\n  his defeat by Pompey, at which time it was published in Rome under the\r\n  title of ‘Antidotum Mithridatum;’ but the probability is, says Dr.\r\n  Heberden, that Mithridates was as much a stranger to his own antidote\r\n  as several eminent physicians have since been to the medicines that\r\n  are daily advertised under their names. It was asserted, that whoever\r\n  took a proper quantity in the morning, was insured from poison during\r\n  the whole of that day, (Galen de Antidot. Lib. 1.) and it was further\r\n  stated, that Mithridates himself was so fortified against all baneful\r\n  drugs, that none would produce any effect when he attempted to destroy\r\n  himself. (Celsus, lib. 5. c. 23.) In the course of ages it has\r\n  undergone numerous alterations. According to Celsus, who first\r\n  described it, it contained only 35 simples; Andromachus, Physician to\r\n  Nero, added vipers, and increased the number of ingredients to 75; and\r\n  when thus _reformed_, he called it γαλήνη—but in Trajan’s time it\r\n  obtained the name of _Theriaca_, either from the vipers in it, or from\r\n  its supposed effect in curing the bites of venomous animals.\r\n  Damocrates gave a receipt for it in Greek Iambics, which has been\r\n  preserved by Galen. It appears then that its composition has hardly\r\n  remained the same for a hundred years; it is, says Dr. Heberden, a\r\n  farrago, that has no better title to the name of Mithridates than, as\r\n  it so well resembles, the numerous undisciplined forces of a barbarous\r\n  king, made up of a dissonant crowd collected from different countries,\r\n  mighty in appearance, but in reality, an ineffective multitude, that\r\n  only hinder each other. ANTIOPIAKA, by W. Heberden, M. D. 1745.\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  The consumption of Tea has greatly increased in England during the\r\n  last thirty years. In 1787 the total amounted to sixteen millions of\r\n  pounds, whereas in 1821, it exceeded twenty-two millions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Hernandez de Toledo sent this plant into Spain and Portugal in 1559,\r\n  when Jean Nicot was Ambassador at the Court of Lisbon from Francis II,\r\n  and he transmitted, or carried either the seed, or the plant to\r\n  Catherine de Medicis: it was then considered as one of the wonders of\r\n  the new world, and was supposed to possess very extraordinary virtues;\r\n  this seems to be the first authentic record of the introduction of\r\n  this plant into Europe. In 1589 the Cardinal Santa Croce, returning\r\n  from his nunciature in Spain and Portugal to Italy, carried thither\r\n  with him Tobacco, and we may form some notion of the enthusiasm with\r\n  which its introduction was hailed, from a perusal of the poetry which\r\n  the subject inspired; the poets compare the exploit of the holy\r\n  Cardinal with that of his progenitor who brought home the wood of the\r\n  true cross.\r\n\r\n               ————————————————————“Herb of immortal fame!\r\n               Which hither first with Santa Croce came,\r\n               When he, his time of nunciature expired,\r\n               Back from the Court of Portugal retired;\r\n               Even as his predecessors, great and good\r\n               Brought home the cross.”——\r\n\r\n  In England, it is said that the smoking Tobacco was first introduced\r\n  by Sir Walter Raleigh on his return from America. James the First\r\n  wrote a philippic against it, entitled a “COUNTERBLASTE TO TOBACCO,”\r\n  in which the royal author, with more prejudice than dignity, informs\r\n  his loving subjects that ‘it is a custome loathsome to the eye,\r\n  hatefull to the nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the lungs;\r\n  and in the blacke stinking fume thereof, neerest resembling the\r\n  horrible Stigian smoake of the pit that is bottomlesse.’ In 1604 this\r\n  monarch endeavoured by means of heavy imposts to abolish its use in\r\n  this country, and in 1619 he commanded that no planter in Virginia\r\n  should cultivate more than 100 lbs. It must be confessed that some\r\n  legislative enactment was necessary at this period for restricting the\r\n  custom of smoking Tobacco; for we are told in the _Counterblaste_,\r\n  that many persons expended as much as five hundred pounds per annum in\r\n  the purchase of this article, which in those days was an enormous\r\n  amount.\r\n\r\n  In 1624 Pope Urban the VIIIth published a decree of excommunication\r\n  against all who took snuff in the church. Ten years after this,\r\n  smoking was forbidden in Russia, under the pain of having the nose cut\r\n  off; in 1653 the Council of the Canton of Appenzel cited smokers\r\n  before them, whom they punished, and they ordered all innkeepers to\r\n  inform against such as were found smoking in their houses. The police\r\n  regulations of Bern made in 1661 was divided according to the Ten\r\n  Commandments, in which the prohibition of smoking stands immediately\r\n  beneath the command against adultery; this prohibition was renewed in\r\n  1675, and the Tribunal instituted to put it into execution—viz.;\r\n  CHAMBRE AU TABAC—continued to the middle of the eighteenth century.\r\n  Pope Innocent the XIIth, in 1690 excommunicated all those who were\r\n  found taking snuff or tobacco in the church of St. Peter at Rome; even\r\n  so late as 1719 the Senate of Strasburgh prohibited the cultivation of\r\n  Tobacco from an apprehension that it would diminish the growth of\r\n  corn; Amurath the IVth published an edict which made smoking Tobacco a\r\n  capital offence; this was founded on an opinion that it rendered the\r\n  people infertile. Those who are curious to learn more of the history\r\n  of this extraordinary plant, I beg to refer to a very interesting\r\n  paper by ‘Medicus,’ in the 24th volume of the ‘London Medical and\r\n  Physical Journal,’ page 445.\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  What other discovery or invention ever produced such political\r\n  consequences as the introduction of the Potatoe as an article of food?\r\n  From its operation as the main constituent of national sustenance the\r\n  population of Ireland has advanced from little more than one million\r\n  to near seven millions, within the last century and a half!\r\n\r\nFootnote 61:\r\n\r\n  Med. Trans. of the College of Physicians, vol. vi. p. 92.\r\n\r\nFootnote 62:\r\n\r\n  That the _warm_ and not the _cold_ bath was esteemed by the ancient\r\n  Greeks, for its invigorating properties may be inferred from a\r\n  dialogue of Aristophanes, in which one of the characters says, ‘I\r\n  think none of the sons of the gods ever exceeded Hercules in bodily\r\n  and mental force,’—upon which the other asks ‘Where didst thou ever\r\n  see a _cold_ bath dedicated to Hercules?’\r\n\r\nFootnote 63:\r\n\r\n  The prohibition of the bath was numbered amongst the mortifications to\r\n  which certain priestesses in Greece were bound by the rigid rules of\r\n  their order.\r\n\r\nFootnote 64:\r\n\r\n  T.

Three drachms of the root of\r\n  the _Male Fern_, reduced to a fine powder, and mixed with water—this\r\n  constitutes one dose. Two hours after taking the powder, a bolus of\r\n  Calomel, Scammony, and Gamboge, is to be administered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 66:\r\n\r\n  DUKE OF PORTLAND’S POWDER FOR THE GOUT.—Equal quantities of the roots\r\n  of _Gentian_, and Birthwort (_Aristolochia rotunda_) the tops and\r\n  leaves of Germander (_chamædrys_) Ground Pine (_Chamæpitys_) and\r\n  lesser Centaury, (_Chironea Centaurium_) powdered and mixed\r\n  together.—As this is a combination of bitters, it might, without\r\n  doubt, be serviceable in certain cases of Gout.\r\n\r\nFootnote 67:\r\n\r\n  This medicine was brought into vogue by M. Husson, a military officer\r\n  in the service of France, about fifty years ago.\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\n  So popular was this plant that it acquired the title of ‘Anima\r\n  articulorum.’ It formed the basis of the Dia Articulorum, the Pulvis\r\n  Arthriticus Turneri, and the Vienna Gout Decoction.\r\n\r\nFootnote 69:\r\n\r\n  Alexander’s Prescription consisted of Hermodactyllus, Ginger, Pepper,\r\n  Cummin seed, Aniseed, and Scammony; which, says he, will enable those\r\n  who take it to walk immediately.\r\n\r\nFootnote 70:\r\n\r\n  “Magisterium Opii fit solvendo Opium in aceto, et præcipitando cum\r\n  sale tartari.——”\r\n\r\nFootnote 71:\r\n\r\n  This was the favourite remedy of Dr. Andrew Boorde, who practised\r\n  physic in Hampshire, and in his work printed in the black letter in\r\n  London, entitled a ‘Breviarie of Health,’ he advises for a tooth-ache\r\n  depending upon worms, ‘a candell of waxe with Henbane seeds, which\r\n  must be lighted so that the perfume of the candell do enter into the\r\n  tooth.’ This said Dr. Andrew Boorde is too important a personage to be\r\n  passed over without some farther notice in this place, being no less\r\n  than the Founder of that dignified class of the medical fraternity,\r\n  better known by the name of _Merry Andrews_. Dr. Andrew Boorde lived\r\n  in the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, and Queen Mary, and was in the\r\n  constant habit of frequenting fairs and markets, at which he harangued\r\n  the populace publicly: his speeches were extremely humourous and\r\n  occasioned considerable mirth; his successors in this same line\r\n  naturally endeavoured to imitate his bright example, and hence this\r\n  class of itinerant quacks obtained the generic appellation of MERRY\r\n  ANDREWS. Since the humiliating triumph of Quackery displayed at the\r\n  Freemason’s tavern, under the presidency of the member for Coventry,\r\n  and more recently at Margate, there is reason to believe that this\r\n  class of itinerant mountebanks will assume a new and more dignified\r\n  appellation, and that in commemoration of the services of their\r\n  _philosophical_ president, the worthy member above stated, they will\r\n  in future be designated by the name of RANTING PETERS.\r\n\r\nFootnote 72:\r\n\r\n  I have been lately much amused with the lucubrations of a classical\r\n  friend, who by way of casting ridicule upon such researches,\r\n  undertakes to prove to my satisfaction that WARREN’S BLACKING is no\r\n  other than the νασμος μελαναυγες “_Black flowing Splendour_,”\r\n  described in the Hecuba of Euripides.\r\n\r\nFootnote 73:\r\n\r\n  This species of delusion, from mistaking the _Post hoc_, for the\r\n  _Propter hoc_, always reminds me of the story of the Florentine Quack,\r\n  who gave the countryman six pills which were to enable him to discover\r\n  his lost Ass,—the pills beginning to operate on his road home, obliged\r\n  him to retire into a wood, where he found his ass. The clown soon\r\n  spread a report of the wonderful success of the empiric, who in\r\n  consequence, no doubt, reaped an ample reward from the proprietors of\r\n  strayed cattle.\r\n\r\nFootnote 74:\r\n\r\n  The grant of £5000 to Joanna Stephens, for her discovery of certain\r\n  medicines for the cure of the Stone, is notified in the London Gazette\r\n  of June, A. D. 1739. See _Liquor Calcis_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 75:\r\n\r\n  Wesley’s Journal, vol. xxix. 290–293.\r\n\r\nFootnote 76:\r\n\r\n  Soon after the invention of the art of Printing, the works of\r\n  Dioscorides, Theophrastus, and Pliny, were published in various forms,\r\n  and Commentators swarmed like locusts. The eagerness with which this\r\n  branch of knowledge was cultivated may be conceived, when it is stated\r\n  that the Commentary of Matthiolus on Dioscorides, which was first\r\n  printed in 1554, passed through seventeen editions, and that 32,000\r\n  copies had been sold before the year 1561; and he tells\r\n  us in this work, that he received in its execution the\r\n  assistance and reward of Emperors,—Kings,—Electors of the Roman\r\n  Empire,—Arch-dukes,—Cardinals,—Bishops,—Dukes, and Princes, ‘which,’\r\n  says he, ‘gives greater credit to our labours than any thing that\r\n  could be said.’ In very many cases, however, says Dr. Pultney, ‘this\r\n  learned Commentator mistook the road to truth, and did but perplex the\r\n  science he so industriously laboured to enlighten.’\r\n\r\nFootnote 77:\r\n\r\n  Turner, the father of English Botany, was of opinion, that it was the\r\n  Polygonum Bistorta; Munting, a Dutch physician, that it was the\r\n  Hydrolapathum Magnum, or Rumex Aquaticus or Great Water Dock, an\r\n  opinion which received the sanction of Ray. Others have supposed it to\r\n  have been Polygonum Persicaria, and some have considered it as the\r\n  Primula Auricula. This one example is adduced to shew the mortifying\r\n  uncertainty that involves the history of ancient plants.\r\n\r\nFootnote 78:\r\n\r\n  Meade thinks that the Athenian poison was a combination of active\r\n  substances,—perhaps that described by Theophrastus as the invention of\r\n  Thrasyas, which, it was said, would cause death without pain, and into\r\n  which Cicuta and Poppy entered as ingredients.\r\n\r\nFootnote 79:\r\n\r\n   “Verbenasque adole pingues, et Mascula Thura.”—_Virg. Eclog._ viii.\r\n\r\n   “Ex Ara hac sume Verbenas tibi.”—_Terent. Andria._\r\n\r\n             “ara castis\r\n   vincta Verbenis.”——_Hor. Od._ xi. _Lib._ iv.\r\n\r\n  It is a curious fact that in Tuscany the word _Vervena_ is applied to\r\n  denote _any_ kind of slips, shoots, suckers, or bundles of plants, at\r\n  this very day.\r\n\r\nFootnote 80:\r\n\r\n  AMLYUM, the Starch of wheat, originally denoted a powder that was\r\n  obtained without the application of a mill, from α, not, and μυλος, a\r\n  mill; thus Dioscorides “Αμυλον ὡνόμασται δἷα τὸ χωρὶς μυλου\r\n  κατασκευαζεσθαὶ”—i. e. _because it is prepared without a mill_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 81:\r\n\r\n  Gerard in his Herbal (1597) denominates it, by way of distinction,\r\n  Potatoe of _Virginia_, and he recommends it to be eaten as a\r\n  _delicate_ dish, not as common food; indeed some time elapsed after\r\n  its introduction before it became general, and it was cultivated as an\r\n  article of diet in Ireland several years before it was common in\r\n  England.\r\n\r\nFootnote 82:\r\n\r\n  The inhalation of the fumes of _Orpiment_ is a practice attributed to\r\n  Galen; and one of the most distinguished of his disciples, Rhazes,\r\n  recommends it to be inhaled by consumptive patients, in combination\r\n  with stimulant and resinous substances, such as _Storax_, _Myrrh_,\r\n  _Galbanum_, and _Aristolochia root_. Bennet recommends the same\r\n  practice in such cases. Willis informs us that a similar custom\r\n  prevailed among certain empirics of his day, and asserts that they\r\n  took such pieces of carpet as were dyed with _Orpiment_, and having\r\n  cut them into small pieces, exposed them to heat, and, by means of an\r\n  inverted funnel, made the patients inhale the vapour. Sir Alexander\r\n  Crichton seems disposed to believe that such applications might prove\r\n  useful by changing the action of any ulcer to which they were applied.\r\n\r\nFootnote 83:\r\n\r\n  Calomel.—There is some doubt respecting the original meaning of this\r\n  word, it literally signifies, _fair_, _black_, καλος, μελας. Sir\r\n  Theodore Mayerne is said to have given the name to it, in consequence\r\n  of his having had a favourite black servant who prepared it; but is it\r\n  not more probable, that its name was derived from the change of colour\r\n  which it undergoes from _black_ to _white_, during its preparation?\r\n  Another explanation has been also given, viz. quòd _nigro_ humori sit\r\n  _bonum_—a _good_ (καλος) remedy for _black_ (μελας) bile. This Theory\r\n  derives much support from the black appearance of the stools, which is\r\n  usually produced by the use of Calomel, and which was erroneously\r\n  attributed to the searching and efficacious nature of the purgative.\r\n  The Calomel of Riverius was a compound of _Hydrargyri Sub-muriat:_ ℈j\r\n  and _Scammoneæ_ gr. vij, and Mr. Gray thinks that the term Calomel was\r\n  first applied to this remedy, as being a mixture of a white and dark\r\n  coloured powder.\r\n\r\nFootnote 84:\r\n\r\n  For further information upon this subject the reader may consult my\r\n  work on “the Elements of Medical Chemistry.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 85:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Blair thinks that the ancients were led in many instances by the\r\n  comparison of habit, to ascribe similar virtues to plants; there does\r\n  not however appear to be a trace of what may be called System, in the\r\n  writings of Theophrastus, Dioscorides, or Pliny. Cæsalpinus was the\r\n  father of botanical system, and he was probably the first who\r\n  suggested the idea that the virtues of plants were discoverable by\r\n  their structure and alliance to each other. In his preface to his\r\n  work, “De Plantis,” he says ‘Quæ enim generis societate junguntur,\r\n  plerumque et similes possident facultates.’ This idea was pursued by\r\n  Petiver, an apothecary in the city of London, a name well known in the\r\n  annals of Botany; there is a paper by him on this subject, in the 21st\r\n  volume of the Philosophical Transactions, entitled, “Some attempts to\r\n  prove that herbs of the same make and class, for the generality, have\r\n  the like Vertue, and Tendency to work the same Effects.” Dr. Murray\r\n  has adopted an arrangement founded upon natural character in his\r\n  celebrated work entitled, “Apparatus Medicaminum”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 86:\r\n\r\n  Russell’s Nat.

Shortly after Sir Humphry\r\n  Davy had succeeded in decomposing the fixed alkalies, a portion of\r\n  _Potassium_ was placed in the hands of one of our most distinguished\r\n  chemists, with a query as to its nature? the philosopher observing its\r\n  aspect and splendour, did not hesitate in pronouncing it to be\r\n  metallic, and uniting at once the idea of weight with that of metal,\r\n  the evidence of his senses was even insufficient to dissever ideas so\r\n  inseparably associated in his mind, and, balancing the specimen on his\r\n  fingers, he exclaimed, “it is certainly metallic, and _very\r\n  ponderous_?” Now this anecdote is not related in disparagement to the\r\n  philosopher in question. Who could have been prepared to meet with a\r\n  substance, so novel and anomalous as to overturn every preconceived\r\n  notion?—A METAL SO LIGHT AS TO SWIM UPON WATER, AND SO INFLAMMABLE AS\r\n  TO CATCH FIRE BY THE CONTACT OF ICE!\r\n\r\nFootnote 90:\r\n\r\n  Virey, “Essai d’Histoire Naturelle et Physicolog: sur la\r\n  perfectibilité de l’homme.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 91:\r\n\r\n  Second Voyage of Captain Cook, vol. 4.\r\n\r\nFootnote 92:\r\n\r\n  The cause of the green colour of oysters is sometimes an operation of\r\n  nature, but it is more generally produced by art, by placing them in\r\n  situations where there is a green deposit from the sea, which appears\r\n  to consist of the vegetating germs of marine _Confervæ_ and _Fuci_,\r\n  and which impart their colour to the oysters. For this object the\r\n  Dutch formerly took oysters from beds on our coasts, and deposited\r\n  them on their own. Native oysters transported into the Colchester beds\r\n  soon assume a green colour. It is unnecessary to refute the popular\r\n  error which attributed this change of colour to the operation of\r\n  copper.\r\n\r\nFootnote 93:\r\n\r\n  We must admit that some of these allegories are too obvious to be\r\n  mistaken. Homer attributes the plague that prevailed in the Grecian\r\n  camp to the darts of Apollo; what was meant by this, but that it arose\r\n  from the action of a burning sun, upon the marshes and slimy shores of\r\n  Troas? and what, again, can be more obvious than the allegory by which\r\n  Echo is made the daughter of air and earth?\r\n\r\nFootnote 94:\r\n\r\n  Bacon’s works, vol. 5, p. 470. 4th Edit.

In this\r\n  country the art of distillation was unknown at the time when the\r\n  Romans had possession of it. It is said to have been introduced in the\r\n  early part of HENRY II.\r\n\r\nFootnote 98:\r\n\r\n  It was destroyed in the sixth century, by the CALIPH OMAR, the\r\n  cotemporary and companion of Mahomet.\r\n\r\nFootnote 99:\r\n\r\n  The Saracens, in their treaty with the Greek Emperors, demanded, by\r\n  express articles, the works of the ancients.\r\n\r\nFootnote 100:\r\n\r\n  Garcias as well as Geoffroy and Hill say that Ætius mentions camphor,\r\n  but it cannot be found, as Dr. Alston has observed, in that, or in any\r\n  other Greek author. There is a _Camphoræ herba_ in Myrepsus; but this\r\n  is evidently a different thing.\r\n\r\nFootnote 101:\r\n\r\n  The Records of Physic, if I am not deceived, will afford numerous\r\n  instances of similar error, from mistaking figurative expressions for\r\n  literal truths. A knowledge of this species of fallacy will explain\r\n  the origin of several very extraordinary receipts. I shall select the\r\n  following instance, by way of illustration. In many of the ancient\r\n  works on Physic, we find the _blood of the goat_ extolled for its\r\n  efficacy in dissolving stones, and, from this supposed lithontriptic\r\n  virtue, it forms the principal ingredient of the POWDER OF NICOLAUS,\r\n  and of the ELECTUARY OF THE QUEEN OF COLEIN. The expression which gave\r\n  origin to this belief was evidently allegorical, signifying that the\r\n  blood of the goat, by which our Saviour was typified, was capable of\r\n  softening the stony hearts of his enemies, or, according to others,\r\n  that by his influence, the stony rocks, and veil of the temple were\r\n  shatterd. _Browne’s Vulgar Errors._\r\n\r\nFootnote 102:\r\n\r\n  Silver, Mercury, Copper, Iron, Tin, Lead.\r\n\r\nFootnote 103:\r\n\r\n  Agricola de veteribus et novis metallis: Lib. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 104:\r\n\r\n  2 Kings, chap. ix. verse 30.\r\n\r\nFootnote 105:\r\n\r\n  It has been already stated, that we are indebted to an Indian for the\r\n  discovery of Bark, and it now appears we derived our knowledge of\r\n  Mercury to the wildest of the alchemists.

Had not modern times, says Sir George Baker, furnished\r\n  similar instances, it would have been a matter of astonishment to us\r\n  to have heard that Erasmus should have deserted an accomplished\r\n  physician whom he so greatly extols in his Epistles, in order to\r\n  consult so wild and illiterate an enthusiast as Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 107:\r\n\r\n  Paracelsus maintained that the human body is composed of salt,\r\n  sulphur, and mercury, and that in these “_three first substances_,” as\r\n  he calls them, health and disease consist: that the mercury, in\r\n  proportion to its volatility, produces tremors, mortifications in the\r\n  ligaments, madness, phrensy, and delirium, and that fevers, phlegmons,\r\n  and the jaundice, are the offspring of the _sulphureous_ principle,\r\n  while he supposed that the cholic, stone, gravel, gout, and sciatica\r\n  derive their origin from salt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 108:\r\n\r\n  Amongst the writers engaged in this contest, no one was more animated\r\n  with party spirit than GUY PATIN, who was profuse in his personalities\r\n  against those who defended the use of Antimony; he drew up a long\r\n  register of the unsuccessful cases in which this medicine had been\r\n  employed, which he published under the title of “ANTIMONIAL\r\n  MARTYROLOGY.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 109:\r\n\r\n  In the year 1644 Schroeder published a _Chemico_-medical Pharmacopœia,\r\n  which delineates with accuracy the pharmacy of these times, and\r\n  enumerates almost all the chemical medicines that were known towards\r\n  the close of this period.\r\n\r\nFootnote 110:\r\n\r\n  The Dispensatories of London and Edinburgh, the former by Mr. A. T.\r\n  Thomson, and the latter by Dr. Duncan, are works which reflect credit\r\n  on the age and country in which they were written.\r\n\r\nFootnote 111:\r\n\r\n  The first Pharmacopœia was published at Nuremburg, under the sanction\r\n  of its Senate, in the year 1542; for this important act we are\r\n  indebted to Valerius Cordus, a young student, who during a transient\r\n  visit at that place, accidentally produced a collection of medical\r\n  receipts which he had selected from the works of the most esteemed\r\n  writers, and with which the physicians of Nuremburg were so highly\r\n  pleased that they urged him to print it for the benefit of the\r\n  apothecaries, and obtained the sanction of the Senate to the\r\n  undertaking; so casual was the circumstance to which we owe the\r\n  institution of Pharmacopœias. The London College were among the last\r\n  to frame a standard Code of Medicines; most cities in Europe having\r\n  anticipated us in the performance of this task; our first Pharmacopœia\r\n  was not published until the reign of James the first, A. D. 1618,\r\n  exactly a century after the College had received their Charter from\r\n  Henry. Successive editions appeared in the following years, viz. in\r\n  1650; 1677; 1721; 1746; 1787; 1809.\r\n\r\nFootnote 112:\r\n\r\n  What would be the surprise and gratification of the Pharmaceutist who\r\n  lived a hundred years ago, if he could now visit Apothecaries Hall?\r\n  the application of steam for the various purposes of pharmacy, and for\r\n  actuating machinery, for levigation, trituration, and other mechanical\r\n  purposes, is no less useful, in ensuring uniform results, than it is\r\n  in abridging labour and economising time. The greatest credit is due\r\n  to the gentlemen under whose guidance this national laboratory is\r\n  conducted, and more especially to their worthy and public spirited\r\n  Treasurer, William Simons, Esq. whose zeal and liberality suggested\r\n  and promoted the fitting up of the Steam Laboratory, as well as the\r\n  ingenious machine for triturating mercury with lard, or conserve.\r\n\r\nFootnote 113:\r\n\r\n  Since the publication of the last edition of this work, Mr. Archdeacon\r\n  Wollaston has paid the debt of nature; his name will be cherished in\r\n  grateful remembrance by those who had the good fortune to have been\r\n  his pupils; as one of that number I will venture to say, that there\r\n  never existed a lecturer on Experimental philosophy, who was more\r\n  eminently gifted with those qualifications, upon which the success of\r\n  a public teacher must depend. He possessed a peculiar method of\r\n  demonstration, a singular vivacity in the manner of conducting the\r\n  experiments, and of keeping awake the attention of his auditors during\r\n  their progress; while those details of manipulation which would have\r\n  proved, in other hands, a source of tedium, he converted into subjects\r\n  of the most lively interest.\r\n\r\nFootnote 114:\r\n\r\n  The Chemical Laboratory at Cambridge has produced some valuable\r\n  discoveries. _Ex pede Herculem_, let me remind the chemist of the\r\n  formation of Nitrous Acid, by passing a current of ammoniacal gas\r\n  through the heated Oxyd of Manganese, for which we are indebted to Dr.\r\n  Milner. I mention it merely as a whimsical circumstance, that the\r\n  greatest degree of cold ever produced, was effected at Oxford, and the\r\n  highest temperature, lately, at Cambridge. The researches of Dr. Clark\r\n  are highly interesting and important, a succinct account of which has\r\n  been published in a small work, entitled, “The Gas Blowpipe, or the\r\n  Art of Fusion, by burning the Gaseous constituents of Water.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 115:\r\n\r\n  These views have prevailed upon the Committee of the College, and they\r\n  have accordingly restored the Soap to the formula, in the present\r\n  edition of the Pharmacopœia; so that the above objection no longer\r\n  exists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 116:\r\n\r\n  The only chemical phenomenon which in any manner resembles this,\r\n  appears to be that of the rapid acetification of milk, and other\r\n  fluids, by the agency of a thunder storm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 117:\r\n\r\n  This practice was introduced into France by Seguin, into Italy by\r\n  Couticini, and into Germany by Bischoff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 118:\r\n\r\n  A very ingenious Dissertation has been lately published by M.

Avenzoar, an Arabian\r\n  physician, who practised at Seville in Spain about the year One\r\n  Thousand, first recommended it in medicine. A composition of Bezoar\r\n  with absorbent powers, has been extensively used under the name of\r\n  _Gascoigne_ powder, and _Gascoigne’s Ball_; but the real bezoar was\r\n  rarely used on this occasion; Gypsum, or pipe-clay tinged with\r\n  ox-gall, proved a less expensive ingredient.\r\n\r\nFootnote 125:\r\n\r\n  ORIBASIUS, a native of Sardes, lived in the fourth century; he was the\r\n  friend and favourite of the Emperor Julian, under whom he had great\r\n  authority, and acquired considerable wealth.

In the present work, I wish the reader to understand the term\r\n  _sympathy_, wherever it may occur, in conformity with the above\r\n  definition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 129:\r\n\r\n  _Colchicum_, _Squill_, and many other vegetable diuretics, are of this\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 130:\r\n\r\n  The Indian Fig, (_Cactus Opuntia_,) when eaten, renders the urine of a\r\n  bloody colour.\r\n\r\n  Rhubarb has likewise an effect upon the colour of this secretion.\r\n\r\nFootnote 131:\r\n\r\n  This is probably the reason of many bodies producing but little effect\r\n  upon the inferior animals. The vegetable eaters are certainly less\r\n  affected by vegetable poisons than those animals who exclusively live\r\n  upon animal substances: it is thus, that a rabbit can take a very\r\n  large dose of opium without any ill effects, while half the same\r\n  quantity would poison a dog. It is a curious fact, that a sound horse\r\n  can take a very considerable portion of opium with impunity, but if he\r\n  be weakened by previous disease, by strong purgatives, or by excessive\r\n  bleeding, he is speedily destroyed by a much less dose; (_See Bracy\r\n  Clarke’s Reformed Pharmacopœia for Horses._) In this latter case, does\r\n  it not appear that the fatal result depends upon the fact of the\r\n  digestive organs having been disabled, by debility, from effecting\r\n  that decomposition by which under ordinary circumstances, the drug is\r\n  disarmed of its potency? What important lights might not be obtained\r\n  by the institution of a series of well devised experiments upon the\r\n  comparative effects of medicinal bodies upon man and other animals?\r\n  The Physiologist has thus availed himself of the resources of the\r\n  comparative anatomist, and I feel persuaded, that results equally\r\n  beneficial to science would follow a similar inquiry in relation to\r\n  the operation of medicines.\r\n\r\n  In the course of the present work, I hope to shew the truth of this\r\n  position by some appropriate illustrations.\r\n\r\nFootnote 132:\r\n\r\n  That the Vena Portarum constitutes one of the avenues through which\r\n  certain extraneous bodies enter the circulating current, there cannot\r\n  exist a doubt; but a series of well-devised experiments are greatly\r\n  wanted for the elucidation of the subject.

In the Fourth Edition\r\n  (published in October, 1820, p. 115,) these views were farther\r\n  extended, and as I could not have been influenced by the experiments\r\n  of M. Majendie, which were not published until some time afterwards,\r\n  it is very fair to conclude, that when two persons arrive at the same\r\n  result by different trains of investigation, such a result must be\r\n  correct. The conclusions established by the experimental inquiries of\r\n  M. Majendie, with regard to absorption, appear to me to be so\r\n  important, in reference to the object of the present work, that I\r\n  shall pause, in this place, for the purpose of furnishing the reader\r\n  with a short account of them. M. Majendie states, that while\r\n  performing the experiment of injecting warm water into the veins of a\r\n  living animal, he first conceived the idea of observing what effects\r\n  would be produced upon the function of absorption by the artificial\r\n  plethora, thus occasioned; having accordingly injected a quantity of\r\n  water into the venous system of a middle-sized dog, he introduced a\r\n  small portion of an active substance, whose effects were well known,\r\n  into his side, when he was surprised to find that its usual operation\r\n  was not manifested until after an interval much longer than usual; the\r\n  same experiment was afterwards repeated upon another animal, and with\r\n  similar results. In a third experiment, as much water (about two\r\n  pounds) was injected, as the animal could sustain without destruction,\r\n  in which case the poisonous substance produced no effect whatever, the\r\n  powers of absorption appearing to be entirely suspended: and having\r\n  waited during half an hour for the occurrence of those symptoms which,\r\n  under ordinary circumstances, would have manifested themselves in two\r\n  minutes, M. Majendie concluded that if vascular congestion be the\r\n  cause of the suspension of absorption, the function ought to be\r\n  restored by the removal of this artificial condition, an opinion which\r\n  he proceeded to verify by experiment; the jugular vein of the animal,\r\n  under trial, was accordingly opened, and the ingenious operator had\r\n  the satisfaction to observe the effects of the poison gradually\r\n  developing themselves in proportion as the blood flowed. M. Majendie\r\n  next proceeded to confirm the truth of his position, by an experiment,\r\n  the converse of those above related; an animal was bled, to the amount\r\n  of about half a pound, and the poisonous substance applied to the\r\n  pleura of the animal, as in the foregoing experiments, when it\r\n  appeared that those effects which, under ordinary circumstances, were\r\n  not evident until after a period of twelve minutes, manifested\r\n  themselves after an interval of only thirty seconds. In order to shew\r\n  that these results actually arose from vascular distention, and not\r\n  from the artificial state of dilution in which the blood was placed,\r\n  M. Majendie instituted the following experiment: a considerable\r\n  quantity of blood was drawn from the vein of a dog, and replaced by a\r\n  similar quantity of warm water, after which a measured quantity of Nux\r\n  Vomica in solution was introduced into the side, when the poisonous\r\n  effects were found to take place with the same rapidity as if the\r\n  blood had not been mixed with water.\r\n\r\nFootnote 154:\r\n\r\n  The practical application of this fact may be useful, and digestion,\r\n  in certain cases, may be thus promoted by the simple expedient of\r\n  changing the quality of our bread.\r\n\r\nFootnote 155:\r\n\r\n  Since the publication of this opinion, in the 5th edition of the\r\n  Pharmacologia, Dr. Hamilton has honoured me by a letter on the\r\n  subject, but I am still bound to confess that my sentiments remain\r\n  unaltered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 156:\r\n\r\n  The Melampodium, or Black Hellebore, was recommended as an agent of\r\n  this description in the strongest terms, by Mead; Savin (Juniperus\r\n  Sabina) is another vegetable which has been generally considered as a\r\n  specific Emmenagogue; with some authors, the Rubia Tinctorum, Madder;\r\n  with others, the Sinapis alba have been regarded as remedies of this\r\n  nature; and lately Polygala Senega has been extolled by the American\r\n  practitioners; in modern times, however, few substances have been more\r\n  confidently recommended as uterine stimulants than the Secale\r\n  Cornutum, or Ergot, but of which I have no practical knowledge.\r\n\r\nFootnote 157:\r\n\r\n  Saline bodies would appear to be the peculiar stimuli of these organs,\r\n  the principal use of which is to separate such saline matter from the\r\n  blood, as would otherwise accumulate in the system. That these saline\r\n  diuretics actually pass off by the kidneys, may be satisfactorily\r\n  shewn by an examination of the urine, in which the bodies in question\r\n  may be chemically detected. Let any person swallow several doses of\r\n  Nitre, taking care that the bowels are not disturbed by the medicine,\r\n  and he will find by dipping some paper into his urine, and afterwards\r\n  drying it, that it will deflagrate, and indicate the presence of\r\n  nitre.\r\n\r\nFootnote 158:\r\n\r\n  The _Secondary_ Diuresis which sometimes takes place under such\r\n  circumstances, and succeeds Catharsis, may offer an apparent exception\r\n  to this law; but this must not be confounded with that which is the\r\n  result of a _Primary_ action upon the urinary organs by the\r\n  absorption, and consequent contact, of a specific Stimulant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 159:\r\n\r\n  Certain mineral waters, containing cathartic salts in a state of\r\n  extreme dilution, if insufficient to excite the bowels, sometimes pass\r\n  off by the kidneys; an effect which can always be prevented by\r\n  accompanying their exhibition with some laxative.\r\n\r\nFootnote 160:\r\n\r\n  See Sir Gilbert Blane’s Medical Logic, Edit. 2, page 190.\r\n\r\nFootnote 161:\r\n\r\n  The cutaneous discharge is very materially modified by the state of\r\n  the atmosphere, in its relations to moisture and dryness: when the air\r\n  contains much moisture it is a bad conductor of the perspirable\r\n  matter, which therefore, instead of being carried off in an insensible\r\n  form, is condensed upon the surface; hence we appear to perspire\r\n  greatly upon the slightest exercise, whereas the cuticular discharge\r\n  is at such times absolutely less. We have all experienced the\r\n  sensation of heat, and disposition to sweating, during the moist\r\n  weather which so frequently occurs in this country in April and May,\r\n  the wind being at the time stationary at south-west or south. On the\r\n  contrary, during the prevalence of an east wind, the most violent\r\n  exercise will scarcely prove diaphoretic, and yet the quantity of\r\n  cutaneous exhalation is far greater than during that state of\r\n  atmosphere when the slightest exercise deluges us with perspirable\r\n  matter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 162:\r\n\r\n  LOMMIUS de Febribus.\r\n\r\nFootnote 163:\r\n\r\n  De Medicina.

It is with this view that\r\n  the Cornish nurse continues to keep down the excess of population, by\r\n  administering Gin and Treacle, in her smoky chimney corner, to\r\n  children labouring under measles, in order to _throw out_ the\r\n  eruption.\r\n\r\nFootnote 165:\r\n\r\n  _M. Du Hamel_ has recorded the cases of two countrymen, considerably\r\n  advanced in life, who were cured of Dropsy by remaining for some time\r\n  in a baker’s oven, soon after the bread had been drawn. _Varikbillan_,\r\n  ninth Caliph of the race of the Abassides, is said to have been cured\r\n  by a nearly similar method. His physician caused him to enter a\r\n  lime-kiln soon after the lime had been removed, when in the course of\r\n  a few days he was totally cured of his dropsy. The ancients excited\r\n  sweating in this disease, by burying the patient up to the neck in\r\n  heated sand or ashes (_Celsus_, Lib. iii. c. 30.), and Lysons cured\r\n  cases by placing his patients in rooms heated to a very high\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\n  In the history of the Royal Academy of Sciences, for 1703, a case is\r\n  related of a woman, who, tired out by the protracted Dropsy under\r\n  which her husband laboured, _charitably_ administered to him a very\r\n  large dose of opium, with the intention of despatching him, but the\r\n  medicine immediately produced such a copious sweat that it restored\r\n  him to health!\r\n\r\nFootnote 166:\r\n\r\n  σιαλος, saliva; et αγω, excito.\r\n\r\nFootnote 167:\r\n\r\n  I of course except its application in the form of vapour, in which\r\n  state it proves extremely active.

It was customary in Greece, when any one sneezed, to exclaim Ζῆθὶ,\r\n  ‘May you live;’ or Ζευ σῶσον, ‘God bless you.’ Aristotle, in his\r\n  problems, has attempted to account for the origin of the custom, but\r\n  unsatisfactorily; Pliny, (Nat. Hist. lib. 28. c. 2) asks—“Cur\r\n  Sternutantes salutentur?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 174:\r\n\r\n  Eberle’s Treatise on the Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nFootnote 175:\r\n\r\n  It is said that whenever Dunning, the celebrated barrister, was called\r\n  upon to make the finest display of his eloquence, whether forensic or\r\n  parliamentary, he constantly applied a blister to his chest, which he\r\n  found to have the effect of imparting an unusual tone and vigour to\r\n  his body, and elevation to his mind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 176:\r\n\r\n  From Setum a Horse hair, a substance which was formerly used for the\r\n  accomplishment of this object.\r\n\r\nFootnote 177:\r\n\r\n  It sometimes happens that the stomach and digestive organs are so\r\n  weakened by disease as to lose their control, or what Dr. Fordyce\r\n  called their ‘governing power,’ in which case they would appear to be\r\n  unable to prevent the matters which they contain from acting\r\n  chemically upon each other, and occasioning decompositions and new\r\n  combinations: in such cases substances are sometimes developed in the\r\n  internal organs by the action of disease, which are capable of\r\n  producing a chemical effect upon the fluids; for instance,—an acid is\r\n  not unfrequently generated in the bowels of children which decomposes\r\n  the bile and produces a green precipitate, and green stools are the\r\n  consequence; in other cases the acid combines with the _Soda_ of the\r\n  bile, and the precipitate thus occasioned is thick, viscid, very\r\n  bitter, and inflammable, and we have stools looking like pitch. In\r\n  Yellow Fever, and in several other diseases, the bile which is brought\r\n  up by vomiting is frequently of a vivid green colour, and some writers\r\n  have attributed the phenomenon to a morbid condition, or action of the\r\n  liver or gall bladder; the fact however is, that the bile itself\r\n  undergoes a chemical change in the Duodenum and Stomach. That bile\r\n  does undergo such a change from decomposition, is proved by a variety\r\n  of facts observed to take place _out_ of the body; it is well known,\r\n  for instance, that the fæces of infants, although yellow when voided,\r\n  frequently become green after some time, and Dr. Heberden observes, in\r\n  his Commentaries, that the urine of a certain jaundiced patient, which\r\n  was of a deep yellow, became after a few hours green: in such cases it\r\n  is probable that an acid is generated by the reaction of the elements\r\n  of which the bile consists.\r\n\r\nFootnote 178:\r\n\r\n  System of Materia Medica, vol. 1. p. 453.\r\n\r\nFootnote 179:\r\n\r\n  The same fact has been long known by the Divers in the Indian\r\n  Pearl-fisheries; see my Work on Medical Jurisprudence, Introduction,\r\n  Vol. 1. p. v.\r\n\r\nFootnote 180:\r\n\r\n  See a paper upon this subject by Mr. Brodie, Phil.

Mr. Barry, in prosecuting his\r\n  interesting and important experiments on the preparation of\r\n  Pharmaceutical Extracts _in vacuo_, discovered the curious fact, that\r\n  Phosphoric acid is to be found in all the extracts in a soluble state;\r\n  and on extending the investigation, says he, it was ascertained that\r\n  this acid, besides that portion of it which exists as phosphate of\r\n  lime, is contained in a vast variety of vegetables, and more\r\n  especially in those which are cultivated. Medico-Chirug. Trans. Vol.\r\n  10, p. 240.\r\n\r\nFootnote 197:\r\n\r\n  The urine of infants and nurses contains very little phosphate of lime\r\n  and phosphoric acid; it is not until after ossification is finished,\r\n  that these elements are found in abundance in the urinary fluid. That\r\n  of old men, on the contrary, contains a great quantity of them; the\r\n  bony system, already overcharged with phosphate of lime, refuses to\r\n  admit more of it. This saline substance would ossify every part, as it\r\n  does sometimes in the arteries, ligaments, cartilages, and membranes,\r\n  if the urine were not to remove the greater part of this superabundant\r\n  portion. In Rachitis it is by the urine that the phosphate of lime\r\n  passes off, the absence of which causes the softness of bones.\r\n  (Richerand). If we might be allowed to theorise, I should say, that\r\n  this disease depends upon a deficient action in the powers of\r\n  assimilation, in consequence of which the phosphoric acid is incapable\r\n  of entering into its assigned combinations, and is therefore\r\n  eliminated as excrementitious. Dr. Glisson considered the disease to\r\n  depend upon some fault in the spinal marrow, whence he termed it\r\n  Rachitis, from ῥακὶς Spina Dorsi.\r\n\r\nFootnote 198:\r\n\r\n  Transactions of Stockholm.\r\n\r\nFootnote 199:\r\n\r\n  CYSTIC OXIDE, discovered by Dr. Wollaston in 1815: it does not affect\r\n  vegetable colours, and has all the chemical habitudes of an oxide.\r\n\r\nFootnote 200:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Marcet discovered two calculi, which were not referable to any of\r\n  the known species; but they are not introduced into the following\r\n  table, as they may never again occur; at all events, from their\r\n  extreme rarity, they cannot be considered as objects of practical\r\n  interest. To one of these he has given the name of Xanthic Oxide,\r\n  because it forms a lemon coloured compound when acted upon by Nitric\r\n  acid. To the other nondescript calculus he has bestowed the\r\n  appellation of Fibrinous, from its resemblance to Fibrine.\r\n\r\nFootnote 201:\r\n\r\n  I am by no means disposed to reject altogether, as a popular fallacy,\r\n  the general opinion in favour of the anti-lithic virtues of malt\r\n  liquor; the observations which have been already offered (page 79)\r\n  will explain how such agents may occasionally operate in assisting\r\n  digestion. In the observations made upon the Bills of Mortality in the\r\n  year 1662, by an ingenious citizen, concerning the increase of some\r\n  diseases, and the decrease of others, it is observed “The Stone and\r\n  Strangury decreaseth, from the drinking of Ale.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 202:\r\n\r\n  In consultation with Dr. Baillie, some few months before his death, he\r\n  said to me “although I have never published the opinion, I am\r\n  satisfied that after a patient has long laboured under diseased liver,\r\n  the blood becomes surcharged with alkaline matter.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 203:\r\n\r\n  See an explanation of this term in the note, at page 112.\r\n\r\nFootnote 204:\r\n\r\n  It is, says Dr. Prout, a very old observation, that injuries of the\r\n  back produce _alkaline urine_; “it also appears,” continues this\r\n  author, “to hold in other animals as well as in man; thus I have\r\n  frequently observed jaded and worn-out horses pass great quantities of\r\n  lime in their urine; I have known the same also to take place in dogs,\r\n  and particularly of the sporting kinds; and in both these instances\r\n  have thought it probable, that the circumstance was connected with\r\n  some strain or injury of the back produced by over-exertion, or other\r\n  causes.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 205:\r\n\r\n  I have in my possession a splendid specimen of this triple salt, in\r\n  large and well defined crystals, covering a portion of a decayed beam;\r\n  it was sent to me by my friend Mr. Marshall, from whom I learnt that\r\n  it had been taken from a privy belonging to a public house in\r\n  Southwark. I lent the specimen to the late Mr. Wilson, in order that\r\n  he might exhibit it in his lectures before the College of Surgeons,\r\n  and he has published a description of it in his work on the Urinary\r\n  and Genital Organs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 206:\r\n\r\n  A question has arisen respecting the comparative efficacy of the two\r\n  fixed alkalies upon these occasions.

The word is also sometimes used in a more\r\n  general sense, for any compounded medicine; thus _Peter Damian_ speaks\r\n  of a person who in his whole life never took an antidote. It is\r\n  likewise used by some authors in a less proper sense, for any remedy\r\n  against any disease, chiefly if it be inveterate, and arise from some\r\n  ulcer or abscess; and lastly, the term has been used to signify a\r\n  perpetual form of medicines, otherwise called _Opiates_, or more\r\n  properly _Confections_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\n  The reader will find this subject treated more fully in the second\r\n  volume of my work on MEDICAL JURISPRUDENCE.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\n  See the history of _Theriaca_ at page 28 note.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\n  JOHN, king of Castille, as Tissot relates, was poisoned by a pair of\r\n  boots, prepared by a Turk; HENRY IV, by gloves; LOUIS XIV fearing a\r\n  project to poison PHILIP V, prohibited his opening letters, or putting\r\n  on gloves (_Tissot Traité des Nerfs_, _T. 1._ _P. 11._ _page 13_;)\r\n  Plouquet has the following remark upon this subject, “Huc et ignota\r\n  illa venena pertinent, quibus epistolæ chirothecæ, et ejusmodi infici,\r\n  et vim adeo toxicam induere dicuntur, ut lectio ejusmodi epistolæ,\r\n  indutus chirothecæ subitam mortem causentur.” (_Comment. Med. super\r\n  Homicid._ page 184.) POPE CLEMENT VII is said by Zacchias to have been\r\n  poisoned by the fumes of a taper, (_Quæst. Med. Leg._); and a priest\r\n  is reported to have offered to destroy QUEEN ELIZABETH by poisoning\r\n  her saddle. (_Sir Edward Coke, in the trial of Sir John Hollis._)\r\n  Bishop Burnet, in the history of his own times (vol. 2. p. 230.) says,\r\n  that some believed CHARLES the Second to have been poisoned through\r\n  the medium of snuff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\n  This conceit does not appear to have been confined to the ignorant\r\n  alone, for we learn from Spratt’s History of the Royal Society, that\r\n  very shortly after the institution of that learned body, a series of\r\n  questions was drawn up by their direction, for the purpose of being\r\n  submitted to the Chinese and Indians, which clearly shews their belief\r\n  in the possibility of such an operation, viz. “Whether the Indians can\r\n  so prepare that stupifying herb, Datura, that they make it lie several\r\n  days, months, years, according as they will have it, in a man’s body,\r\n  without doing him any hurt, and at the end kill him without missing\r\n  half an hour’s time?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Mead adopted this opinion, but he became so convinced of its\r\n  inadequacy that, in the later editions of his work on Poisons, he\r\n  withdrew the hypothesis. It is hardly necessary to observe that upon\r\n  its abandonment, a host of popular antidotes at once fell into disuse;\r\n  for as long as the injury was supposed to arise from mechanical\r\n  irritation, oils, fats, and other similar remedies were held capable\r\n  of obtunding the acrimony. So has the abandonment of other conceits\r\n  and hypotheses cleared away many absurd articles from the list of\r\n  Antidotes; see page 26.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\n  The introduction of poisons into the body through the medium of the\r\n  circulation of the blood is frequently alluded to by the physiologists\r\n  of the seventeenth century. I have lately met with a curious passage\r\n  in a work entitled “Popular Errours in Physick, first written in\r\n  Latine by the learned physitian, James Penrose, Doctor in Physick.\r\n  London, 1651.” “The venome is carried by the veines and arteries, as\r\n  appeares in that all the blood of them that have been bitten by a\r\n  viper doth turne into a pale greennesse. And seeing that the veines in\r\n  the papps are so very slender, and doe not come unto the heart, but\r\n  with a great many long windings, I affirme, and it is more probable,\r\n  that if the viper be applyed to the feet, which are farthest remote\r\n  from the heart, it will sooner infect the heart than if to the papps,\r\n  but soonest of all if it be applied to the armes. And now the story of\r\n  CLEOPATRA comes to my minde. PETRUS VICTORIUS blames the painters,\r\n  that paint Cleopatra applying the aspe to her papps, seeing it is\r\n  manifest out of PLUTARCH in the life of ANTONIUS, and out of PLINIE\r\n  likewise, that she applyed it to her arme. ZONARAS relates that there\r\n  appeared no signe of death upon her, save two blew spots on her arme.\r\n  CÆSAR also in her statue which he carryed in triumph, applyed the aspe\r\n  to her arme; for in the armes there are great veines and arteries,\r\n  which doe quickly, and in a straight way convey the venome to the\r\n  heart, whereas in the papps the vessels are slender. And therefore in\r\n  SAINT PAUL the miracle was so much the greater, in that he felt no\r\n  harme from the viper, which layd hold on his hand, for if it had\r\n  assailed him on the breast, he had had respite enough to take some\r\n  antidote.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\n  There can be no doubt but that death has been produced by the\r\n  mechanical operation of various insoluble bodies; although we cannot\r\n  believe the numerous tales recorded on the subject of diamond dust\r\n  (supposed to constitute the basis of the celebrated “Powder of\r\n  Succession”) or of powdered glass, &c. Numerous cases are recorded\r\n  where life has been destroyed by the lodgement of substances in the\r\n  intestines; and we have lately heard of the fatal effects produced by\r\n  alvine accumulations from the habitual use of Magnesia. With respect\r\n  to the danger from the ingestion of glass and enamel in powder, there\r\n  still exists much difference of opinion; Caldani, Mandruzzato, and M.\r\n  Le Sauvage, report experiments made upon men and animals, in which no\r\n  bad consequences followed; on the other hand, Schurigius (Chylologia)\r\n  and Cardanus (De Venenis) cite instances where persons have died of\r\n  ulcerations of the stomach from such causes; and M. Portal, Foderé,\r\n  (Medicine Legale) Plouquet (Comment. super Homicid.) Stoll, (Ratio\r\n  Medendi, part vi. p. 60) Gmelin (Hist. General de Ven. mineral.)

No sooner\r\n  however was the monster born than it perished, because the diaphragm\r\n  and other muscles of respiration were unable to perform their\r\n  functions without the aid of nervous excitement; no air was therefore\r\n  inhaled into the lungs, and in a few minutes the heart ceased to\r\n  contract from the deficient supply of oxygenized blood.

This apparent anomaly at first led\r\n  Mr. Brodie, as he has since informed me, to suspect the accuracy of\r\n  his experiments: and I suggested to him, whether a probable\r\n  explanation might not be derived from the late chemical researches\r\n  into the composition of tobacco, which have shewn the existence of two\r\n  active principles, viz. _Nicotin_, and an _Essential Oil_? Where an\r\n  infusion is employed, we seem to obtain the influence of the former,\r\n  and the effects are displayed upon the heart; but where the oil is\r\n  applied, the _Nicotin_ has been removed, and the brain is the organ\r\n  principally affected—see Tabaci Folia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\n  Dry Vomit of Marriott.

Many of those substances which we are at present\r\n  bound to consider _similar_, will no doubt, require to be transplanted\r\n  into other classes as the progress of physiological knowledge shall\r\n  elucidate their modes of action. In this attempt to teach the Art of\r\n  Medicinal Combination, I have endeavoured to reduce the propositions\r\n  it comprehends to the greatest degree of generality of which they are,\r\n  at present, susceptible.\r\n\r\nFootnote 242:\r\n\r\n  Numerous isolated statements of the same tendency may be adduced, but\r\n  these cannot invalidate the claim of Dr. Fordyce, as the first person\r\n  who generalized the fact, and applied it with success to practice.\r\n  DIEMERBROECK, in his notes upon the Theriaca Andromachi, observes that\r\n  the composition is a more efficacious medicine from the concurrent\r\n  powers of so many ingredients, alike in virtue: and Quincy, in his\r\n  Lectures on Pharmacy, which were published by Dr. Shaw in 1723, says\r\n  “those fetid gums which are generally prescribed in Hysteria, as\r\n  Ammoniacum, Galbanum, &c. may be conjoined with advantage, because\r\n  from a concurrence of properties, they all conspire to the same end.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 243:\r\n\r\n  Such was the nature of the “Mustacea” of the Romans, which were a\r\n  species of cake, used at weddings, and consisted of meal, aniseed,\r\n  cummin, and several other aromatics; their object was to remove or\r\n  prevent the indigestion which might be occasioned by eating too\r\n  copiously at the marriage entertainment. It must be acknowledged that\r\n  this compound was better adapted for such a purpose than the modern\r\n  Bride-cake, to which it gave origin. Cato (de R. R. c. 121) has given\r\n  us a receipt for the Roman bride-cake.\r\n\r\nFootnote 244:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Majendie goes so far even as to assert, that by varying the\r\n  different preparations of the _same_ Narcotic, we shall be better able\r\n  to keep up its action on the animal œconomy, without an increase of\r\n  its dose. He adds, “Some English writers have denied the truth of this\r\n  observation: but they have not given any reasons for their\r\n  scepticism.—Why should it not be true?”\r\n\r\nFootnote 245:\r\n\r\n  It would even appear probable that in some cases mercurial influence\r\n  has, after its subsidence, been renewed by doses of Opium: a\r\n  remarkable instance of this kind is related in Hufeland’s Journal\r\n  (vol. ix.) in which an old woman is said to have fallen into a\r\n  considerable salivation after every dose of Opium; she had previously\r\n  applied to the physician for an extensive ulceration over her body,\r\n  and had taken a considerable quantity of mercury; but the effects had\r\n  subsided, until renewed by the opium.\r\n\r\nFootnote 246:\r\n\r\n  It has been observed under the history of Emetics (p. 84), that in\r\n  cases of profound intoxication, or in those of violent wounds and\r\n  contusions of the head, vomiting will not take place, however forcibly\r\n  the stomach may be goaded by an emetic, whereas if the brain be only\r\n  partially influenced, as by incipient intoxication, or by a less\r\n  violent blow on the head, its irritability is increased instead of\r\n  being paralysed, and that vomiting under such circumstances is excited\r\n  by the slightest causes; just so is it with regard to Narcotics, a\r\n  powerful dose so paralyses the nervous system, that the stomach cannot\r\n  be made to reject its contents, as every one must have observed in\r\n  cases of narcotic poisoning, while smaller doses, like lesser injuries\r\n  of the head, dispose the stomach to sickness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 247:\r\n\r\n  Sir Gilbert Blane has advanced an ingenious hypothesis to explain the\r\n  cause of the fœtid breath of persons under the influence of mercury;\r\n  which might perhaps also shew why certain remedies are rendered more\r\n  efficient by combination with mercury. One of the active effects of\r\n  mercury, says Sir Gilbert, is to _alter the natural sensibility of the\r\n  Lacteals_, so that when under its influence, they absorb\r\n  indiscriminately that which is excrementitious and nutritive; hence\r\n  the smell of the breath, since the fœtid particles are carried into\r\n  the circulation, and thrown off in the halitus of the lungs, or by the\r\n  salivary glands, in consequence of the mouth of the lacteals losing\r\n  that selecting tact, whereby in their sound state they reject whatever\r\n  is offered to them, except the chyle. Now if mercury acts as the\r\n  “_Soporata Offa_” to the lacteals, it is evident that its combination\r\n  with active matter may, on some occasions, facilitate the absorption\r\n  of the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 248:\r\n\r\n  In some cases, however, the energy of an active bitter would seem to\r\n  be diminished by an alkali; and it may therefore be more prudent to\r\n  administer such substances at different periods. I apprehend that the\r\n  powers of _Squill_ are thus invalidated by a fixed alkali.\r\n\r\nFootnote 249:\r\n\r\n  The Arabian and Greek physicians scarcely noticed the leaves, but\r\n  always employed the pods of Senna; a fact which will explain the\r\n  operation of this plant, as observed by them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 250:\r\n\r\n  Mac Culloch on Wine. Edit. 2. p. 42.\r\n\r\nFootnote 251:\r\n\r\n  If the facts stated in this section be true, we are bound to recognise\r\n  two orders of medicinal elements,—the one comprehending those that\r\n  possess an inherent and independent activity,—the other, those that\r\n  are in themselves inert, but which are capable of imparting impulse\r\n  and increased energy to the former when combined with them. As this is\r\n  a new view of the subject of vegetable combinations, no apology is\r\n  necessary for the introduction of new terms for its explanation; I\r\n  therefore propose to designate the former of these SUBSTANTIVE, and\r\n  the latter, ADJECTIVE constituents. When the structure of vegetable\r\n  remedies shall have been thoroughly examined upon this principle of\r\n  combination, much medicinal obscurity will be removed, and probably\r\n  some pharmaceutical improvements of value suggested; at all events it\r\n  will teach a lesson of prudent caution to the pharmaceutic chemist; it\r\n  will shew the danger of his removing this or that element from a\r\n  vegetable compound, merely because he finds, upon its separation, that\r\n  it is inert. I dwell the more upon this point, because I feel that\r\n  there never was a period in the history of medicine, at which such a\r\n  caution was more necessary; for while the poly-pharmacy of our\r\n  ancestors has driven the physician of the present day into a\r\n  simplicity of prescription that on many occasions abridges his powers\r\n  and resources, the progress of chemical knowledge has diffused through\r\n  the class of manufacturing chemists a bold spirit of adventure and\r\n  empiricism,—a mischievous propensity to torture our best remedies, in\r\n  order to concentrate or extract the parts which they consider to\r\n  constitute their essential ingredients.\r\n\r\n  A Memoir has lately been presented to the PHILOMATIC SOCIETY OF PARIS,\r\n  by M. Robiquet, on the subject of _Aroma_, which affords some\r\n  important analogies in proof of the law of combination, which I am now\r\n  endeavouring to elucidate. From the experiments of this laborious\r\n  chemist it would appear, that odours are not as Fourcroy supposed,\r\n  _the effect of the simple solution of certain bodies in air_, but that\r\n  for their developement, some third body (coinciding in its office with\r\n  my ADJECTIVE constituent) possessing in itself none of the\r\n  characteristic odour, is absolutely necessary as an intermede, varying\r\n  in its nature according to that of each odorous body, in the same way\r\n  that the mordant requires to be varied by the dyer, according to the\r\n  nature of the colouring matter which it is intended to fix on the\r\n  cloth;—thus Ambergris has in itself very little odour, but the\r\n  addition of Musk developes a very strong and decided one; this also\r\n  happens in a less degree with Lavender, and the perfumers therefore\r\n  add a small quantity of musk to the distilled water of this plant. In\r\n  other cases, Ammonia lends, as it were, its volatility to bodies, the\r\n  odour of which without such an auxiliary, would be scarcely sensible;\r\n  this is exemplified by the practice of perfumers exposing their musk\r\n  and other substances to the atmosphere of privies when they lose their\r\n  power: (_Paul Amman: Manduct: ad Mat: Med:_) so again in order to give\r\n  pungency to snuff it is made to suffer the commencement of\r\n  fermentation, in which case ammonia is generated; and it is a curious\r\n  fact that the odour of the best snuff may be destroyed by mixing with\r\n  it a little tartaric acid, by which its ammoniacal salt is\r\n  neutralized. In some instances the _adjective_ ingredient seems to be\r\n  Sulphur, as in the essential oils of some cruciform plants, and\r\n  particularly in that of mustard seed, for M. Robiquet found that this\r\n  oil lost its odour by being kept in contact with a metallic surface,\r\n  and that an inodorous oil remained, while the metal became a\r\n  sulphuret: perhaps, adds M. Robiquet, it may be sometimes necessary\r\n  for the full and exquisite developement of odour in these bodies to\r\n  add another vehicle, thus the addition of a little Acetic acid\r\n  heightens the odour of Mustard.\r\n\r\n  Iron has little, or no odour; but when volatilized with hydrogen, its\r\n  odour is very powerful. The smell of copper and brass must depend upon\r\n  some circumstance not well understood.\r\n\r\nFootnote 252:\r\n\r\n  Astruc, and other practitioners of the same school, always premised a\r\n  mercurial course with venesection: it is probable that many of the\r\n  anomalies observed in the modern application of this remedy may have\r\n  arisen from an inattention to the diet of those who are under\r\n  mercurial influence. Mercury is in itself a most powerful stimulant,\r\n  and ought therefore to be accompanied with depletion and low diet;\r\n  besides which, the experiments of Majendie have shewn how greatly such\r\n  a state of the system will expedite the effects of the mercurial\r\n  remedy.\r\n\r\nFootnote 253:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Eberle, of Philadelphia, in a work lately published, has quoted\r\n  the above passage, and remarks, that he has long been acquainted with\r\n  the fact which it announces; although he proposes to account for it by\r\n  a different train of reasoning; he considers that Nauseants encourage\r\n  mercurial ptyalism, by favouring an afflux to the salivary glands. The\r\n  learned author must allow me to congratulate him upon this fortunate\r\n  discovery; unless his patients be blessed with as much apathy as was\r\n  ever assumed by the Gilbertine order of Benedictines, he need never in\r\n  future despair of influencing them by mercury. He has only to condemn\r\n  the refractory to meagre fare, and then to tantalize them, as poor\r\n  Sancho was, in his government, with the sight, or rather smell, of a\r\n  savoury dish, and he will without doubt secure his object,—but, to be\r\n  serious, if Dr. Eberle’s views be correct, how will he explain the\r\n  modus operandi of _fear_, as related in the text? for the tendency of\r\n  fear is to _diminish_ the salivary secretion, as will be hereafter\r\n  mentioned.\r\n\r\nFootnote 254:\r\n\r\n  Fear, contrary to joy, decreases, for a time, the action of the\r\n  extremities of the arterial system, as is seen by the sudden paleness\r\n  which succeeds, and the shrinking or contraction of the vessels of the\r\n  skin. M. de Haen relates the case of a painter who suffered\r\n  convulsions, which were succeeded by a return of his colic. In this\r\n  case the poison which had been, for a long time, admitted into his\r\n  constitution in consequence of his daily employment, was, by the\r\n  passion of anger, immediately brought into action. It was formerly\r\n  observed by Citois, that the inhabitants of the province of Poitou,\r\n  who had suffered anxiety of mind on account of any misfortune to\r\n  themselves or family, were particularly susceptible of the disease.\r\n\r\nFootnote 255:\r\n\r\n  How admirably do the results of Majendie’s experiments coincide with\r\n  this reasoning; see page 84; and yet Dr. Eberle, in the work quoted\r\n  below, appears unwilling to admit such a theory.\r\n\r\nFootnote 256:\r\n\r\n  A treatise of the Materia Medica, and Therapeutics, by J. Eberle, M.D.\r\n  In two volumes. Philadelphia, 1822.\r\n\r\nFootnote 257:\r\n\r\n  In the same manner is the salivary secretion immediately influenced by\r\n  the operation of the mind; the sight of a delicious repast to a hungry\r\n  man is not more effectual in exciting it, than is the operation of\r\n  fear and anxiety in repressing and suspending it. Whence we are led to\r\n  believe, that the Hindoo Ordeal by Rice may have occasionally assisted\r\n  in the ends of Justice. This ordeal was conducted in the following\r\n  manner. The persons suspected of any crime being assembled in a ring,\r\n  a certain portion of dried rice was given to each, which they were\r\n  directed to chew for some minutes, and then to turn it out of their\r\n  mouths upon the leaves or bark of a tree. Those who were capable of\r\n  returning it in a pulpy form were at once acquitted, while those from\r\n  whose mouths it came out dry, were pronounced guilty. See Medical\r\n  Jurisprudence, Introduct. Vol. 1. p. viii.\r\n\r\nFootnote 258:\r\n\r\n  The capacity of our digestive organs sufficiently testifies that\r\n  nature never intended them for the reception of highly concentrated\r\n  food, while this idea is farther strengthened by perceiving how\r\n  sparingly she produces concentrated aliment; the saccharine matter of\r\n  esculent fruits is generally blended with acidulous and mucilaginous\r\n  ingredients; and the oleaginous principle of seeds, kernels, and other\r\n  similar substances, is combined with farinaceous matter: the capacity\r\n  observable in the organs of graminivorous animals evidently shews that\r\n  they were also designed for a _large bulk_ of food, and _not_ for\r\n  provender in which the nutritive matter is concentrated; the\r\n  gramineous and leguminous vegetables do not present their nutritive\r\n  matter in a separate state, nor is the animal furnished with an\r\n  apparatus by which he can separate the chaff and straw from the\r\n  grain,—the obvious inference is, that he was intended to feed\r\n  indiscriminately on both.\r\n\r\n  Some years ago I constructed a Logometric scale of Equivalents,\r\n  analogous in principle to that which I have now introduced under the\r\n  title of the “MEDICINAL DYNAMETER,” to shew the relative nutritive\r\n  strength of different vegetables, and to work problems connected with\r\n  them; I soon found, however, that unless _bulk_ was taken into\r\n  calculation, it was incapable of furnishing even an approximation to\r\n  truth.\r\n\r\nFootnote 259:\r\n\r\n  Med.

With respect to the number and variety of such\r\n  substances, it must be confessed that our Pharmacopœia contains but a\r\n  meagre bill of fare.\r\n\r\nFootnote 263:\r\n\r\n  The same reasoning will explain why English hops, that contain more\r\n  Gallic Acid and Tannin than those imported from the Continent, are\r\n  found to be superior as preservatives of beer.\r\n\r\nFootnote 264:\r\n\r\n  Therapeutics, vol. 2. p. 470.\r\n\r\nFootnote 265:\r\n\r\n  This subject has been ably illustrated by Mr. R.

D. Read September 9, 1771.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 270:\r\n\r\n  The most subtle of all poisons,—_the matter of febrile contagion_,—is\r\n  certainly modified in activity by the degree of moisture in the\r\n  atmosphere influencing its solubility; the Plague is said to be most\r\n  common in Egypt after the inundation of the Nile, a period at which\r\n  the atmosphere is necessarily saturated with water; according to the\r\n  account of Sir Robert Wilson, the English and Turkish armies that\r\n  marched to Cairo escaped contagion, while the troops that remained\r\n  stationary on the moist shore of Aboukir, were very severely visited.\r\n  On the other hand, the _Harmattan_, a wind experienced on the western\r\n  coast of Africa, between the Equator and fifteen degrees _North\r\n  Latitude_, blowing from north-east towards the Atlantic, and which, in\r\n  consequence of its passage over a very extensive space of arid land,\r\n  is necessarily characterized by excessive dryness, puts an end to all\r\n  Epidemics, as the Small Pox; and infection at such a time does not\r\n  appear to be easily communicable even by art. _Philosophical\r\n  Transactions_, vol. 21.\r\n\r\n  The difficulty of communicating infection to animals during a dry\r\n  state of the air, as remarked on the Western Coasts of Africa, during\r\n  the blowing of the _Harmattan_, agrees with some observations on\r\n  Plague by the French physicians, as this complaint first made its\r\n  appearance in the French army during a moist state of the air in\r\n  Syria, when it lay under the walls of Jaffa in February, 1800.\r\n\r\n  It is a well known fact that volatile bodies are sooner converted into\r\n  a gaseous state by the presence of water in the atmosphere; this is\r\n  strikingly exemplified by the greater rapidity with which _Limestone_\r\n  is burnt and reduced to quick-lime in moist weather, and by the\r\n  assistance which is rendered in a dry season, by placing a pan of\r\n  water in the ash-pit; so again the perfume of flowers is most sensible\r\n  when the air is humid, as during the fall of the evening dew, or in\r\n  the morning when the dew evaporates, and is dissipated by the rays of\r\n  the rising sun; for the same reason the stench of putrid ditches and\r\n  common sewers, is conveyed to the organs of smell much more speedily\r\n  in summer previous to rain, when the air is charged with moisture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 271:\r\n\r\n  They are previously calcined, but not burnt to lime, to an extent only\r\n  that may destroy their tenacity, and render them fit for levigation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 272:\r\n\r\n  A similar custom is common to the Indians of the whole of Asia, and of\r\n  America; for the practice of the South American Indians, see\r\n  _Humboldt’s Personal Narrative_. In India, Betel, variously\r\n  compounded, is employed for the purpose above stated. The mixture more\r\n  commonly used in Ceylon consists of quick-lime, Arecanut, and Tobacco,\r\n  wrapped in Betel leaf. On ordinary occasions it is only masticated;\r\n  but to repress the painful calls of hunger, the juice is swallowed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 273:\r\n\r\n  Vol. viii. p. 33.\r\n\r\nFootnote 274:\r\n\r\n  Dr. MacCulloch, in illustration of this subject, states, that ink,\r\n  paste, and seeds, are among the common articles which suffer from such\r\n  a cause, and to which this remedy is easily applicable. With respect\r\n  to articles of food, such as bread, cold meats, or dried fish, it is\r\n  less easy to apply the remedy, on account of the taste; cloves,\r\n  however, and other spices whose flavours are grateful, may sometimes\r\n  be used for this end. It is notorious that gingerbread, and bread\r\n  containing caraway seeds, are far less liable to mouldiness than plain\r\n  bread. The effect of cloves in preventing the mouldiness of ink is\r\n  generally known; and the same result may be obtained by oil of\r\n  lavender in a very minute quantity, or by any other of the perfumed\r\n  oils. Russian leather, which is perfumed with the tar of the Birch\r\n  tree, is not subject to mouldiness, as must be well known to all who\r\n  possess books thus bound; they even prevent it from taking place in\r\n  books which are bound in calf, and near which they may happen to lie.\r\n  Paste is another perishable article, and although _Alum_ which is used\r\n  by the book-binder will certainly preserve it longer than it would\r\n  remain useful without it, still it is not very effectual. _Rosin_,\r\n  sometimes used by the shoemaker, answers the purpose better, and\r\n  appears to act entirely on this principle; it is however far less\r\n  effectual than even oil of turpentine; _Lavender_, and the other\r\n  strong perfumes, as _Peppermint_, _Anise_, and _Bergamot_, are\r\n  perfectly effectual, even in a very small quantity, and paste may be\r\n  thus preserved for any length of time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 275:\r\n\r\n  Medical Logic, Edit. 2. p. 192, _note_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 276:\r\n\r\n  It appears from what has been stated under Section I. B. with respect\r\n  to DIURETICS, that some medicines not only assist, but actually DIRECT\r\n  the operation of the substances with which they may be associated, and\r\n  that many remedies act in unison with those they are joined with; thus\r\n  _Nitre_ in conjunction with _Squill_ is diuretic; in conjunction with\r\n  _Guaiacum_, diaphoretic; for these reasons I hesitated whether I ought\r\n  not to have added a fifth _constituent_, and restored the “_Dirigens_”\r\n  of ancient authors; enough, however, has been said to enable the\r\n  practitioner to appreciate the importance of such a law of medicinal\r\n  combination.\r\n\r\nFootnote 277:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Percival in his Essays, ingenuously exemplifies this error by\r\n  stating a case which occurred in his own practice. “I ordered,” says\r\n  he, “a combination of Camphor and Balsam of Copaiba in the form of\r\n  pills, but the apothecary informed me that he was unable to form them\r\n  into a mass, since they liquefied like treacle.” I may here observe\r\n  that the addition of a small portion of the coagulated yolk of an egg,\r\n  would have rendered the mixture practicable.\r\n\r\nFootnote 278:\r\n\r\n  This would occur, if in making the Pilulæ Ferri Compositæ, we were to\r\n  substitute the Liquor Potassæ for the Sodæ Sub-carbonas.\r\n\r\nFootnote 279:\r\n\r\n  The “Pharmacopœia Bateana” contains a Formula for a “Tinctura\r\n  Antiphthisica,” which is stated to be “a truly good medicament in\r\n  those consumptions which proceed from ulcers of the lungs.” The\r\n  following is the Receipt—℞. Sacch: Saturn: ℥ij—Sal Martis ℥j—Infus:\r\n  Spir: Vin: ℔j—Dose from twenty to forty drops. In this case an\r\n  insoluble Sulphate of Lead must be formed, which will render the\r\n  medicine, as far at least as its saturnine effects are concerned,\r\n  completely inert!\r\n\r\nFootnote 280:\r\n\r\n  This fact has been very satisfactorily proved by the failure of the\r\n  practical attempts which were made by Dr. Macbride of Dublin, to\r\n  improve the art of tanning leather by the use of Lime-water, instead\r\n  of plain water, which he conceived would extract the virtues of Oak\r\n  Bark more completely. The reader who is desirous of a more detailed\r\n  account of this plan must refer to Phil. Trans. Vol. lxxiii. part 1,\r\n  Art. 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 281:\r\n\r\n  We trust these observations will not create any alarm in the worthy\r\n  Citizen; he may, with as much safety as pleasure, continue the\r\n  laudable practice of regaling himself and friends with a cup of strong\r\n  tea, in spite of the Turtle soup they may have taken, and that too\r\n  without the least danger of converting their stomachs into tanneries,\r\n  or their food into leather.\r\n\r\nFootnote 282:\r\n\r\n  For a highly ingenious, and important extension of these views, see\r\n  Aqua Marina. (Note.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 283:\r\n\r\n  M. Dive, an apothecary of Mont de Marson, has lately announced that a\r\n  current of carbonic acid, when passed through a solution of Tartrate\r\n  of Potass, partly decomposes it; and he ascribes to the same agent the\r\n  production of the Bi-tartrate in the juice of the grape during its\r\n  fermentation: accordingly, by mixing neutral tartrate with fermentable\r\n  materials, we shall produce Cream of Tartar in the fermented liquor.\r\n  Journal de Pharm. Octob. 1821. p. 487.\r\n\r\nFootnote 284:\r\n\r\n  In one remarkable case related by this Physician, the operation of the\r\n  unbruised mustard-seed is stated to have been promoted by combining it\r\n  with a decoction of _Broom-tops_. Query, Was not the adjunct in this\r\n  case the only efficient part of the remedy?\r\n\r\nFootnote 285:\r\n\r\n  The word “_Venenum_,” was employed by the ancients to signify both a\r\n  _poison_ and a _medicine_; in the former of these acceptations it is\r\n  used by Virgil in the following passage:\r\n\r\n        “Picus equum domitor, quem capta cupidine conjunx\r\n        Aurea percussum virga, versumque VENENIS,\r\n        Fecit avem Circe, sparsitque coloribus alas.”\r\n                                                  Æneid. Lib. vii.\r\n\r\n  In the latter sense it is used by Plautus—\r\n\r\n                “Quia sorbitione faciam ego te hodie mea\r\n                Item, ut Medea Peliam concoxit senem,\r\n                Quem medicamentis, et suis VENENIS dicitur\r\n                Fecisse rursus ex sene adolescentulum\r\n                Item ego te faciam.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 286:\r\n\r\n  See the dissertation on the operation of _Emetics_, page 84.\r\n\r\nFootnote 287:\r\n\r\n  Cases and Observations, illustrating the influence of the Nervous\r\n  System, in regulating animal heat, by H.

The phenomena of _Accumulation_ may on some\r\n  occasions depend upon the absolutely increased quantity of the\r\n  substance in the body, as in the instance of mercurial action, while\r\n  in others they may perhaps arise from the system becoming more and\r\n  more sensible to its stimulus. The history of Poisons would afford\r\n  some interesting illustrations of these views, and in another work\r\n  (Medical Jurisprudence, Vol. 2, p. 148), I have proposed a subdivision\r\n  of these bodies, under the title of “_Accumulative_ Poisons.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 289:\r\n\r\n  “Diary of an Invalid.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 290:\r\n\r\n  Med.

See “An Essay towards ascertaining\r\n  the doses of vomiting and purging Medicines, by Dr. CHARLES BALGUY,\r\n  Physician at Peterborough.” Vol. 1. 167.\r\n\r\nFootnote 293:\r\n\r\n  While this sheet was passing through the press, an anecdote was\r\n  related to me, which is well calculated to illustrate the mischief\r\n  that may arise from abbreviated prescriptions. One of our most eminent\r\n  surgeons having occasion to direct the application of a Lead Plaster\r\n  (Emplast: Lythargyi. P. L. 1787), he abbreviated the term as\r\n  follows—_Emp. Lyth:_ in the haste of compounding, the _h_, perhaps\r\n  carelessly written, was easily mistaken for _t_, and the chemist\r\n  accordingly sent the _Emplast: Lyttæ_! As it was applied to the\r\n  Pudenda, it is not necessary to state the distress of the patient, and\r\n  the dismissal of the practitioner, which followed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 294:\r\n\r\n  Camphor, unless it be presented to the stomach in a state of minute\r\n  division, is liable to occasion heat and uneasiness in that organ.\r\n  Fothergill’s Med. Observ. vol. i. p. 432.\r\n\r\nFootnote 295:\r\n\r\n  In some cases the subject to be pulverized has been previously exposed\r\n  to heat, but the doubtful influence of exalted temperature upon\r\n  vegetable bodies, ought to afford us a lesson of extreme caution; the\r\n  astringency of the stalks of the Artichoke is entirely destroyed by\r\n  being gently heated in an oven, for after this operation they no\r\n  longer strike a black colour with the salts of iron: another example\r\n  is afforded us in the effects of heat upon Starch, which is thus\r\n  changed into a species of gum, no longer producing a blue colour with\r\n  Iodine, and which is known in commerce under the name of “British\r\n  Gum.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 296:\r\n\r\n  It is perhaps not generally known, that the sugared plumbs sold to\r\n  children consist very frequently of Plaister of Paris; the\r\n  introduction of such a substance into the intestines may often prove a\r\n  source of mischief. I also understand, that it is no uncommon fraud to\r\n  adulterate biscuits with the same substance. I confess I felt a great\r\n  inclination to oppose the practice, lately suggested, of improving bad\r\n  flour by the addition of Magnesia; I object to the introduction of any\r\n  foreign and insoluble substance into our daily bread, and I am\r\n  satisfied that the result of medical experience will sanction such an\r\n  objection.\r\n\r\nFootnote 297:\r\n\r\n  Edition 2. 1823.—I shall avail myself of the present opportunity to\r\n  recommend this work to the perusal of every student who is ambitious\r\n  to become acquainted with the Literature of his profession.\r\n\r\nFootnote 298:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Davy informs me that the _Veddahs_, a savage race inhabiting the\r\n  wilds of Ceylon, even in that hot climate, effectually preserve their\r\n  venison in honey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 299:\r\n\r\n  There is one circumstance which sometimes renders the powder of\r\n  liquorice objectionable upon such occasions; it is liable to irritate\r\n  the fauces and occasion coughing: for this reason I always avoid its\r\n  use in cases of pulmonary irritation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 300:\r\n\r\n  Some extracts become so hard, that in the state of pill they pass\r\n  unchanged; this has occurred to me with the _extract of logwood_.\r\n  Astringent vegetable matter, in combination with iron, is frequently\r\n  characterised by a hardness that is not exceeded by ebony, and which\r\n  is perfectly insoluble; the action of iron upon the petals of the red\r\n  rose furnishes a very striking instance of this fact; if the petals be\r\n  beaten in an iron mortar, for some hours, they ultimately become\r\n  converted into a paste of an intensely black hue; which, when rolled\r\n  into beads and dried, is susceptible of a most beautiful polish, still\r\n  retaining the fragrance of the rose. I have seen a necklace of this\r\n  description; indeed these beads form an article of extensive commerce\r\n  with the Turks, and are imported into Europe, through Austria, under\r\n  the name of _Rose Beads_ or _Rose Pearls_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 301:\r\n\r\n  Crell’s Annals, 1798. vol. 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 302:\r\n\r\n  A remedy may even owe its virtues to a precipitation, produced by\r\n  admixture, as I have already stated.\r\n\r\nFootnote 303:\r\n\r\n  See my work on MEDICAL CHEMISTRY, Sect.

Let us decypher the intention of the different\r\n  ingredients by their_ KEY LETTERS. _The basis is Squill, to which\r\n  Digitalis is added, for the purpose we perceive of acting in unison\r\n  with it, and Calomel, which succeeds it, is intended to promote and\r\n  direct the diuretic Basis; two fœtid gums next present themselves to\r\n  our notice, and these are shewn by the bracket to exert a combined\r\n  action, depending, as the Key Letter announces, upon the medicinal\r\n  similarity, but acting in the general scheme of the formula, as shewn\r\n  by the exterior letter, for the purpose of fulfilling a second\r\n  indication, distinct and different from that which the Basis is\r\n  designed to answer, i. e. to produce, not a diuretic, but an\r\n  antispasmodic and stimulant effect; an important question then arises\r\n  for our consideration—Is the latter part of the formula consistent\r\n  with the former, or is the stimulant effect of the Gums compatible\r\n  with the sedative operation of Digitalis?_\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n  Abĭes ab abeo, quod in cœlum longe abeat.\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Maton, in his appendix to Mr. Lambert’s work on the genus _Pinus_,\r\n  observes that the _Thus_ of the ancients, (λὶβανος) does not appear to\r\n  have been the product of any species of Pinus, although we are\r\n  informed by Dioscorides (Lib. 1. c. 7.) that Pine resin was often\r\n  substituted for it. He describes, moreover, a method of distinguishing\r\n  between the two kinds; “Resin of the Pine,” says he, “when thrown into\r\n  the fire dissipates itself in smoke, whereas Frankincense burns with a\r\n  brisk flame, and with an odour that serves to detect the imposition.”\r\n  “Some authors, adds Dr. Maton, have considered the genuine λὶβανος\r\n  (_Thus_) to have been obtained from the Juniperus Lycia, and to\r\n  constitute the Olibanum of our shops, but I cannot find any passage in\r\n  the ancient authors sufficiently precise to corroborate this\r\n  conjecture.” Op: citat:\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\n  From α not, and ψὶντος pleasure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\n  Mouldiness is a peculiar plant, propagated by seeds, infinitely small;\r\n  Reaumur found the interior of an addled egg mouldy, hence the seeds\r\n  must have passed through the pores of the shell! Dr. Macculloch has\r\n  lately announced the curious fact, that the propagation of mouldiness\r\n  may be prevented by the presence of aromatic substances. See p. 177,\r\n  _Note._\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\n  This fact has enabled the Chemist to prepare an indelible ink, not\r\n  affected by acids.\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\n  KEYSER’S ANTIVENEREAL PILLS consist of this mercurial salt, triturated\r\n  with Manna.\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\n  Vinegar quenches the thirst, and is particularly refreshing after much\r\n  bodily exertion. It was this property that invigorated the soldiers of\r\n  Hannibal in their progress over the Alps; it is absurd to imagine that\r\n  Livy meant to assert that the rocks were _dissolved_ by Vinegar: the\r\n  expression is only metaphorical. See Sodæ Murias.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\n  The varieties of vinegar known in commerce, are three, viz. _Wine_\r\n  Vinegar, _Malt_ Vinegar, and _Sugar_ Vinegar; to which may now be\r\n  added that from wood, and which is described under the title of ACIDUM\r\n  ACETICUM FORTIUS, or Acidum Aceticum, _e ligno destillatum_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n  I apprehend that the superior power of animal charcoal, over that of\r\n  vegetable origin, in removing colouring matter, depends upon the\r\n  peculiar texture of the former. At the same time it must be\r\n  acknowledged, that there are certain phenomena which would appear to\r\n  indicate the existence of a chemical difference in these substances;\r\n  thus if Lime water be boiled with _animal_ charcoal, the whole of the\r\n  lime will be abstracted from the water, whereas the same effect is not\r\n  produced by the action of charcoal of _vegetable_ origin. See Liquor\r\n  Calcis.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\n  The Sulphuric acid is added for the purpose of preserving the vinegar\r\n  from decomposition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n  This quantity includes the alkali necessary to saturate the Sulphuric\r\n  acid which is allowed to be added. 145 grains of alkali is the\r\n  standard fixed by act of Parliament, which will be found to coincide\r\n  with the atomic weights of these bodies.\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n  By _real_ Acetic acid is meant such an acid as occurs in a dry\r\n  acetate; it cannot exist uncombined with water, or a base.\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n  This is a very ancient preparation, thus Ausonius,\r\n\r\n               “Scillato decies si cor purgeris aceto\r\n               Anticipitesque tuum Samii Lucomonis acumen.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n  In following the directions of the College the first pint is rejected,\r\n  and this, according to Mr. Phillips (Remarks on the Pharmacopœia)\r\n  contains a notable quantity of acid. Hence Distilled Vinegar can never\r\n  be so strong as the Vinegar from which it is distilled.\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\n  Or it may be detected, in very minute quantities, by the elegant test\r\n  lately employed by Dr. Marcet, and which I have frequently repeated in\r\n  my Lectures with considerable satisfaction. It consists in adding a\r\n  little sulphuric acid with a small quantity of muriate of soda, and\r\n  then immersing a little gold leaf in the mixture, when after boiling\r\n  it, if any nitric acid should have been present, the gold leaf will be\r\n  dissolved.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n  It had been long known that by the destructive distillation of any\r\n  kind of wood, an acid is obtained, which was formerly considered of a\r\n  distinct and peculiar nature, and termed Acid Spirit of Wood, and\r\n  afterwards Pyroligneous Acid. Glauber appears to have been the first\r\n  chemist who was aware of its true nature, for he speaks of it as the\r\n  “Vinegar of Wood.” It was however reserved for Fourcroy and Vauquelin\r\n  to demonstrate its composition by experiment, and they have\r\n  accordingly proved beyond doubt that it is merely the Acetic acid,\r\n  contaminated with Empyreumatic oil and Bitumen. The address of modern\r\n  chemists has at length enabled them to get rid of every trace of these\r\n  latter ingredients, and to furnish an acid perfectly devoid of any\r\n  foreign flavour. The crude pyroligneous acid, as it is first received,\r\n  is rectified by a second distillation in a copper still, in the body\r\n  of which about 20 gallons of viscid tarry matter are left from every\r\n  100. It has now become a transparent brown vinegar, having a\r\n  considerable empyreuma; it is then redistilled and saturated with\r\n  quick-lime, and the liquid acetate is evaporated to dryness and\r\n  submitted to gentle torrefaction, in order to dissipate the\r\n  empyreumatic matter, and lastly the calcareous salt is decomposed by\r\n  sulphuric acid, when a pure, perfectly colourless, and grateful\r\n  vinegar rises in distillation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n  This instrument was invented by Messrs. Taylors for this particular\r\n  purpose; the principle consists in forming a neutral salt with dry\r\n  hydrate of lime and the acid to be examined, and then taking the\r\n  specific gravity of the solution. Act 58. G. III. c. 65, § 8.\r\n\r\nFootnote 335:\r\n\r\n  It may be necessary to state, that the Pharmaceutist should never\r\n  purchase acetic acid of greater strength than that of 75° of the\r\n  Acetometer, when it is intended for dilution, for although he might\r\n  thus avoid the expense of carriage, the saving will be more than\r\n  counterbalanced by the excessive duty levied upon acids above that\r\n  standard. There is moreover a great loss in the preparation of strong\r\n  acids, so that the manufacturer cannot afford to sell them at a price\r\n  which is merely proportional to their strength. Acid of 75° is\r\n  regularly kept by Messrs. Beaufoy for dilution, and if mixed with\r\n  eleven parts of pure water is equivalent to the common distilled\r\n  vinegar of the Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 336:\r\n\r\n  It ought to have been 1·048 of 55° Fah: but the error lies in the\r\n  scale of Taylor’s Acetometer, which appears to be incorrect at this\r\n  point.\r\n\r\nFootnote 337:\r\n\r\n  I believe that no manufacturer, except Messrs. Beaufoy, makes an acid\r\n  stronger than this; the College sample was obtained from that house.\r\n\r\nFootnote 338:\r\n\r\n  The Reviewer of Mr. Phillip’s Translation of the Pharmacopœia, in the\r\n  Royal Institution Journal for July, 1824, has fallen into an important\r\n  error upon this subject, against which it may be necessary to caution\r\n  the reader; he says, “the term ‘_diluted acetic acid_’ is properly\r\n  enough applied to Distilled Vinegar, but the process of distillation\r\n  might well have been rejected; for all medical purposes a dilute acid,\r\n  composed of one part of the concentrated acid, contained in the\r\n  Materia Medica, and four parts of water, is preferable. Of this\r\n  mixture, or of distilled vinegar, the specific gravity should be\r\n  1·009, and 1000 grains should saturate 145 grains of Sub-carbonate of\r\n  Soda.” The reviewer has mistaken the acid of sp. gr. 1·043 mentioned\r\n  by Phillips, as the strongest he has met with, for the Pharmacopœia\r\n  acid of sp. gr. 1·046; for, should he dilute the latter with only four\r\n  times its weight of water, he would produce a compound containing\r\n  5·686 per cent. of real acid, or one considerably stronger than the\r\n  strongest malt vinegar, and twice the strength of distilled vinegar.\r\n  The reviewer takes this occasion to indulge his favourite passion for\r\n  abusing the Pharmacopœia, and he asks with an air of sarcasm, Where\r\n  was Dr. Paris during the late revision? I answer—engaged in the\r\n  discharge of my duty as a humble member of the Committee, and I can\r\n  assure him that nothing which he has yet urged has convinced me that I\r\n  have failed in its fulfilment, or erred in its execution:—but it is\r\n  now my turn to enquire, and I do so with perfect good humour, where\r\n  the reviewer could have been when he composed the above passage? that\r\n  he was _not at home_, is I think sufficiently evident from the\r\n  statement which I have just offered.\r\n\r\nFootnote 339:\r\n\r\n  A very useful practical application has been made of the Pyroligneous\r\n  Acid, for the purpose of correcting the excessive fœtor attendant upon\r\n  mortification. Dr. Samuel W. Moore of this city, (to whom we are\r\n  indebted for the suggestion,) has detailed the particulars of a case\r\n  of extensive mortification of the cheek, resulting from the use of\r\n  mercury, in which the acid was applied, and with the happiest success.\r\n  In a case of cancerous breast, it was also used with the same object,\r\n  and with similar effect. The mode of using it is simply to apply\r\n  pieces of lint or linen wet with the acid to the part affected. See\r\n  New-York Medical Repository, Vol. 22. p. 237.—_Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 340:\r\n\r\n  AROMATIC VINEGAR is merely an acetic solution of camphor, oil of\r\n  cloves, of lavender, and of rosemary. The acetic acid used for this\r\n  purpose is about 145° of the acetometer, containing 68·5 per cent. of\r\n  real acid. A preparation of this kind may be extemporaneously made by\r\n  putting ʒj of Acetate of Potass into a phial with a few drops of some\r\n  fragrant oil, and in m xx of Sulphuric Acid.\r\n\r\n  THIEVES VINEGAR, or MARSEILLES VINEGAR, is a pleasant solution of\r\n  essential oils and camphor, in vinegar; the Edinburgh Pharmacopœia has\r\n  given a formula for its preparation under the title of “Acetum\r\n  Aromaticum.” The repute of this preparation as a prophylactic in\r\n  contagious fevers is said to have arisen from the confession of four\r\n  thieves, who, during the plague of Marseilles, plundered the dead\r\n  bodies with perfect security, and, upon being arrested, stated on\r\n  condition of their lives being spared, that the use of Aromatic\r\n  Vinegar had preserved them from the influence of contagion. It is on\r\n  this account sometimes called “Le Vinaigre des quatre voleurs.” It was\r\n  however long used before the Plague of Marseilles, for it was the\r\n  constant custom of Cardinal Wolsey to carry in his hand an orange,\r\n  deprived of its contents, and filled with a sponge which had been\r\n  soaked in vinegar impregnated with various spices, in order to\r\n  preserve himself from infection, when passing through the crowds which\r\n  his splendour or office attracted. The first Plague raged in 1649,\r\n  whereas Wolsey died in 1531. The French Codex has a preparation of\r\n  this kind, consisting of an acetic infusion of various aromatic herbs\r\n  and camphor, which is termed “Acetum Aromaticum Alliatum,” seu\r\n  “Antisepticum” _vulgo_ “des Quatre Voleurs.” p. 108. The German\r\n  Dispensatories abound with Medicated Vinegars, chiefly aimed against\r\n  Pestilential Diseases.\r\n\r\nFootnote 341:\r\n\r\n  The more familiar of these are _Bitter Almonds_, the _Cherry Laurel_\r\n  (Lauro Cerasus,) the leaves of the _Peach tree_, the kernels of fruit,\r\n  pips of apples, &c. The prussic acid would appear to be most abundant\r\n  in the thin pellicle that envelopes the kernel; the fleshy parts of\r\n  these fruits do not contain it, and even the berries of the _Lauro\r\n  Cerasus_ may be eaten with impunity; and yet the distilled water, and\r\n  oil of this plant are the most destructive of all narcotic poisons, as\r\n  was evinced by the murder of Sir Theodosius Broughton, by Laurel\r\n  Water; and by the untimely fate of Dr. Price, of Guildford, in the\r\n  year 1782, who professing to convert Mercury into Gold, offered to\r\n  repeat his experiments before an adequate tribunal, but put a period\r\n  to his existence before the appointed day, by a draught of Laurel\r\n  Water. Consistent with theory, the watery extract of Laurel is\r\n  harmless, a fact easily explained, since the narcotic acid is entirely\r\n  volatilized before the fluid can assume the consistence of an extract.\r\n  The Laurel Water as a medicinal agent appears to have been long known.\r\n  Linnæus, informs us that it was frequently used in Holland, in\r\n  pulmonary consumption. (_Amænitat. Academ._ vol. iv. p. 40.) The Bark\r\n  of the _Prunus Padus_, or Bird Cherry Tree, was ascertained to contain\r\n  Prussic acid, by M. Bergemann, in 1811, and it is certainly a curious\r\n  fact, as Dr. Granville has observed, that superstitious people should\r\n  have selected the berries of this shrub to form necklaces, which are\r\n  hung round the neck of children to prevent fits and allay cough from\r\n  teething. For farther information upon this subject, the reader may\r\n  consult “The Chronological recapitulation respecting the Introduction\r\n  of the Prussic acid into the Practice of Physic,” in the work of Dr.\r\n  Granville, above cited.\r\n\r\nFootnote 342:\r\n\r\n  See Journal of Science and the Arts, No. xxv.\r\n\r\n  The following table comprehends their results.\r\n\r\n      Quantity of liquid Acid.

The experience of practitioners in this country has by\r\n  no means confirmed the high expectations originally entertained of\r\n  this article. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 346:\r\n\r\n  The only mineral substances in which this acid has been found is the\r\n  _Fer Azuré_ of Haiiy, and a new substance which is found accompanying\r\n  Welsh Culm, and of which I have given an account in the first volume\r\n  of the Transactions of the Royal Geological Society of Cornwall,\r\n  although in this latter instance it is probably a product, not an\r\n  educt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 347:\r\n\r\n  The following is the chemical reasoning upon which this process is\r\n  founded. “The prime equivalent of prussic acid is exactly one-eighth\r\n  of that of the mercurial peroxide. But as the prussiate of mercury\r\n  consists of two primes of acid to one of base, or is in its dry\r\n  crystalline state a _By-cyanide_, we have the relation of one to four\r\n  in the formation of that salt, when we act on the peroxide with cold\r\n  prussic acid.” Hence is derived the above simple rule of analysis.\r\n  (Journal of Science and the Arts.) Upon the same principle it has been\r\n  already stated, that the quantity of real acetic acid, in any given\r\n  sample of distilled vinegar may be discovered by the test of carbonate\r\n  of lime, see _Acid. Acetic. Fort._ They furnish beautiful\r\n  illustrations of the practical importance of the doctrine of Definite\r\n  Proportions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 348:\r\n\r\n  This offers a striking example of the confusion produced by the\r\n  constant changes in chemical nomenclature; in the former editions of\r\n  this work, the term _Hydro_ was prefixed to _Muriatic Acid_, as an\r\n  epithet expressive of the presence of _water_, whereas the same word\r\n  is now used to denote the existence of _Hydrogen_ as one of its\r\n  elements.\r\n\r\nFootnote 349:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Powell directs only _two_ parts of acid; but this is evidently too\r\n  little, for it appears by Dr. Wollaston’s scale, that 3 parts of salt\r\n  require 2½ of oil of vitriol for their decomposition; and in addition\r\n  to this, the oxide of manganese will require a farther addition to\r\n  convert it into a sulphate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 350:\r\n\r\n  As Chlorine is by pressure condensable into a liquid, tubes containing\r\n  a small quantity of it, and hermetically sealed, might be very\r\n  usefully employed for this purpose, since by breaking off the\r\n  extremity, the chlorine would instantly assume the gaseous state, and\r\n  diffuse itself through the apartment.\r\n\r\nFootnote 351:\r\n\r\n  There is a curious illustration of this fact in the German\r\n  “_Ephemerides_;” the case of a person is described who had taken so\r\n  much Elixir of Vitriol that his keys were rusted in his pocket, by the\r\n  transudation of the acid through his skin!\r\n\r\nFootnote 352:\r\n\r\n  Nitric acid may be considered as one of the most efficient agents in\r\n  our possession for exciting prompt vesication. For this purpose, we\r\n  believe it was first used in the epidemic Cholera of the East Indies,\r\n  and the success which attended it in that fatal disorder suggested its\r\n  application in a variety of other diseases. The mode of using it is to\r\n  rub the surface intended to be vesicated, with the pure acid, and as\r\n  soon as pain is produced, to neutralize the acid by washing the part\r\n  with a solution of salt of tartar. If the object is to continue the\r\n  irritation, a common blister may be laid upon the part. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 353:\r\n\r\n  _Nitrous acid gas_ is a combination of nitrous gas and oxygen.\r\n\r\nFootnote 354:\r\n\r\n  ELIXIR OF VITRIOL.

Its atomic composition has not yet been ascertained, but it will\r\n  probably be found to consist of equal atoms of carbonic acid and\r\n  ammonia, and must therefore be a true Carbonate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 367:\r\n\r\n  It appears that this is not the only article that has suffered in its\r\n  quality by the cheap materials which have been brought into the market\r\n  from those works. I understand that the practical chemist can obtain\r\n  little or no Naphtha from the Barbadoes Tar, owing to its adulteration\r\n  with the residue of the gas light process.\r\n\r\nFootnote 368:\r\n\r\n  NOYAU.—Crème de Noyau. Bitter Almonds blanched 1 oz. Proof spirit half\r\n  a pint, Sugar 4 oz. It is sometimes coloured with cochineal. The\r\n  foreign Noyau, although differently prepared, is indebted to the same\r\n  principle for its qualities. It is a liqueur of a fascinating nature,\r\n  and cannot be taken to any considerable extent without danger; the\r\n  late Duke Charles of Lorraine nearly lost his life from swallowing\r\n  some “Eau de Noyau,” (water distilled from Peach kernels) too strongly\r\n  impregnated. Journal des Debats, 22, Decembre, 1814.\r\n\r\nFootnote 369:\r\n\r\n  ALMOND PASTE. This Cosmetic for softening the skin and preventing\r\n  chaps, is made as follows: Bitter almonds blanched 4 oz.; the white of\r\n  an egg; rose water and rectified spirit, equal parts, as much as is\r\n  sufficient.\r\n\r\nFootnote 370:\r\n\r\n  For the derivation of this term, and remarks thereon, see p. 38.\r\n  (Note).\r\n\r\nFootnote 371:\r\n\r\n  The fecula of various grains are employed as articles of diet for the\r\n  sick, e. g. SAGO, prepared from the pith of the Cycas Circinalis, its\r\n  granular form is imparted to it by passing it, when half dry, through\r\n  a coarse sieve. SALOP, from the Orchis Mascula. TAPIOCA from the root\r\n  of the Jatropa Manhiot. By expressing the root of this plant, the\r\n  juice of which is extremely acrid, and baking the cake that is left,\r\n  an alimentary substance is prepared called CASSAVA, the peculiar merit\r\n  of which, like tapioca, is to swell and soften in water, and thus to\r\n  make an excellent pudding. ARROW ROOT is from the Maranta Arundinacea.\r\n  The arrow root however, usually sold, is the fecula of potatoes; 100\r\n  lbs. of which would yield about 10 lbs. of fecula, and it is worthy of\r\n  remark that for this purpose frozen potatoes answer as well as those\r\n  not spoiled by the frost. Dr. Ainslie, in his Materia Medica of\r\n  Hindostan, informs us that “an excellent Arrow root, if it may be so\r\n  called, is now prepared in the Travancore country from the root of the\r\n  Curcuma Angustifolia, no way inferior to that obtained from the\r\n  Maranta Arundinacea.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 372:\r\n\r\n  The method of deducing the value of seeds, from their relative\r\n  weights, appears to have been one of the earliest instances of the art\r\n  of taking specific gravities; thus Pliny (Nat. Hist. lib. xviii.)\r\n  estimated the relative weights of several species of grain.\r\n\r\nFootnote 373:\r\n\r\n  CHAMOMILE DROPS. The nostrum sold under this name is a spirit\r\n  flavoured with the essential oil of Chamomile. It is very obvious that\r\n  it cannot possess the bitter tonic of the flowers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 374:\r\n\r\n  THE EVERLASTING PILL of the ancients consisted of _metallic_ Antimony,\r\n  which being slightly soluble in the gastric juice was supposed to\r\n  exert the property of purging as often as it was swallowed. This was\r\n  economy in right earnest, for a single pill would serve a whole family\r\n  during their lives, and might be transmitted as an heir-loom to their\r\n  posterity. We have heard of a Lady who having swallowed one of these\r\n  pills, became seriously alarmed at its not passing; upon sending\r\n  however for her physician, he consoled her with the assurance that it\r\n  had already passed through a hundred patients with the best effect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 375:\r\n\r\n  The manner of doing it among the Turks, is described by Shaw and\r\n  Russel. Chateaubriand also remarks, “The women of Athens appear to me\r\n  smaller and less handsome than those of the Morea, their practice of\r\n  painting the orbits of the eyes blue, and the ends of the fingers red,\r\n  is disagreeable to the stranger.” Dr. Badham has also given us an\r\n  interesting note upon this subject in his learned Translation of\r\n  Juvenal.

Dr. Duncan also observes that it seems to\r\n  constitute a quack remedy which has acquired some reputation in\r\n  Ireland for the cure of cancer, where it is used as an external\r\n  application to the sore.\r\n\r\nFootnote 377:\r\n\r\n  This saline body was first made known by Adrian de Mynsicht in his\r\n  Thesaurus Medico-chymicus, published in 1631; although it appears\r\n  probable that the preparation was suggested by a treatise, entitled\r\n  “Methodus in Pulverem,” published in Italy in 1620. This book, written\r\n  by Dr. Cornachinus, gives an account of a method of preparing a powder\r\n  which had been invented by Dudley, Earl of Warwick, and which had\r\n  acquired considerable celebrity in Italy; this powder was composed of\r\n  Scammony, Sulphuret of Antimony, and Tarter, triturated together.\r\n\r\nFootnote 378:\r\n\r\n  There is a Tartrate of Antimony, but it can scarcely be made to\r\n  crystallize; it easily assumes a gelatinous form; and it may be here\r\n  observed that Antimony is one of those metals whose oxides seem to\r\n  combine with difficulty, and to form compounds of little permanency\r\n  with acids, unless there be present at the same time an alkali or\r\n  earth; and their solutions, in most cases, yield, on dilution, a white\r\n  precipitate.\r\n\r\nFootnote 379:\r\n\r\n  The compound of Tartarized Antimony and Bark, is said to purge, and to\r\n  constitute the “Bolus ad Quartanas” of the French physicians.\r\n\r\nFootnote 380:\r\n\r\n  The Sugar is added with a view to prevent the ointment from becoming\r\n  rancid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 381:\r\n\r\n  NORRIS’S DROPS.

I am\r\n  credibly informed that the original recipe contained opium, but that\r\n  which I have examined, and which was procured from a respectable\r\n  agent, yielded no indications of its presence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 382:\r\n\r\n  Hard water has a tendency to produce diseases in the spleen of certain\r\n  animals, especially sheep: this is the case in the eastern side of the\r\n  island of Minorca, as we are informed by Cleghorn. The mischievous\r\n  tendency of bad water, where it cannot be corrected by some chemical\r\n  process, would seem to be best counteracted by bitter vegetables.\r\n  Virey supposes that this circumstance first induced the Chinese to\r\n  infuse the leaves of the tea plant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 383:\r\n\r\n  Alpini informs us that Elephantiasis is endemial in Egypt; Galen\r\n  ascribes it to the impure waters of the Nile, and Lucretius adopted\r\n  the same opinion.\r\n\r\n              “Est Elephas morbus, qui propter flumina Nili\r\n              Gignitur Ægypto in Medio.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 384:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Percival observes that bricks harden the softest water, and give\r\n  it an aluminous impregnation; the common practice of lining wells with\r\n  them, is therefore very improper, unless they be covered with cement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 385:\r\n\r\n  The same strumous affection occurs at Sumatra, where ice and snow are\r\n  never seen; while, on the contrary, the disease is quite unknown in\r\n  Chili and Thibet, although the rivers of these countries are chiefly\r\n  supplied by the melting of the snow with which the mountains are\r\n  covered. The trials of Captain Cook, in his voyage round the world,\r\n  prove the wholesomeness of _Ice water_ beyond a doubt; in the high\r\n  southern latitudes he found a salutary supply of fresh water in the\r\n  ice of the sea; “this melted ice,” says sir John Pringle, “was not\r\n  only sweet but soft, and so wholesome as to shew the fallacy of human\r\n  reasoning unsupported by experiments.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 386:\r\n\r\n  I take this opportunity of observing that I have made analyses of\r\n  several of those springs in Cornwall, which have from time immemorial\r\n  enjoyed a reputation in the neighbourhood for curing diseases, amongst\r\n  which were the waters of Holywell, so named from its supposed virtues,\r\n  and those of Permiscen Bay, equally extolled for their medicinal\r\n  qualities. But I have only been able to detect minute quantities of\r\n  carbonate of lime, derived from infiltration through banks of\r\n  calcareous sand.

VIII. c. 5.\r\n\r\nFootnote 388:\r\n\r\n  I am informed by a respectable chemist in this town, that he sells a\r\n  large quantity of alum for this very purpose, as well as to publicans\r\n  for the sake of clearing their spirituous liquors; for the same end,\r\n  we are told, that the wine merchants in Paris put into each cask of\r\n  wine as much as a pound of alum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 389:\r\n\r\n  This is particularly the case with respect to the water of the River\r\n  Thames; for as it contains but a small proportion of saline matter, it\r\n  is remarkably soft, although it holds suspended mud, and vegetable and\r\n  animal debris, which occasion it to undergo a violent change on being\r\n  kept: a large volume of carburetted and sulphuretted hydrogen gases is\r\n  evolved, and it becomes black and insufferably offensive; upon racking\r\n  it off however into large earthen vessels, and exposing it to the air,\r\n  it gradually deposits a quantity of black slimy matter, and becomes as\r\n  clear as crystal, and perfectly sweet and palatable, and is\r\n  exceedingly well adapted for sea store. “THE NEW RIVER WATER” contains\r\n  a small proportion of muriate of lime, carbonate of lime, and muriate\r\n  of soda; it differs also in its gaseous contents: 100 cubic inches of\r\n  New River Water contain 2·25 of carbonic acid, and 1·25 of common air,\r\n  whereas the water of the Thames contains rather a large quantity of\r\n  common air, and a smaller proportion of carbonic acid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 390:\r\n\r\n  The law which determines such combinations has been investigated with\r\n  singular ingenuity and success by Dr. Murray, (Transactions of the\r\n  Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1816). Berthollet had already established\r\n  the important fact, that combinations are often determined by the\r\n  force of cohesion, in such a manner, that in principles acting on each\r\n  other, those on which this force operates most powerfully, in relation\r\n  to the fluid which is the medium of action, are combined together;\r\n  hence from a knowledge of the solubility of the compounds which\r\n  substances form, we may predict what combinations will be established\r\n  when they act on each other, those always combining which form the\r\n  least soluble compounds. It is for the extension of these views, and\r\n  for the useful application of them, that we are indebted to Dr.\r\n  Murray, who justly observes that if the force of cohesion can so far\r\n  modify chemical attraction, as to establish among compound salts\r\n  dissolved in any medium, those combinations whence the least soluble\r\n  compound are formed, we are entitled to conclude that the reverse of\r\n  this force, i. e. the power of a solvent, may produce the opposite\r\n  effects, or cause the very reverse of these combinations to be\r\n  established, so that in a concentrated medium the least soluble will\r\n  be formed, and in a dilute one, the more soluble compounds will be\r\n  established. Hence follows the simple rule by which the actual state\r\n  in which saline bodies exist in a solution may be determined, viz.\r\n  that in any fluid containing the elements of compound salts, the\r\n  binary compounds existing in it will be generally those which are most\r\n  soluble in that fluid, and the reverse combinations will only be\r\n  established by its concentration favouring the influence of cohesion.\r\n  It appears that by simply evaporating a saline solution we may produce\r\n  changes in its composition, and obtain products which never existed in\r\n  its original state of dilution; thus, suppose muriate of magnesia and\r\n  sulphate of soda to be dissolved in water, as is actually the case in\r\n  the water of the ocean, and the solution to be concentrated by\r\n  evaporation from heat; the combinations of sulphate of magnesia and\r\n  muriate of soda, being on the whole less soluble in water, this\r\n  circumstance of inferior solubility, or the force of cohesion thus\r\n  operating, actually determines the formation of these compounds; and\r\n  the production of sulphate of magnesia from the bittern is to be\r\n  explained upon this principle. Since it appears therefore that the\r\n  influence of solubility is most important, temperature, to whose\r\n  dominion it is under all circumstances subject, must necessarily be\r\n  alike powerful; let us exemplify this fact by the action of the very\r\n  salts under consideration; it has been just stated that muriate of\r\n  magnesia and sulphate of soda decompose each other in a concentrated\r\n  solution at a high temperature, producing muriate of soda and sulphate\r\n  of magnesia, but at temperatures below 32° the reverse actually takes\r\n  place, muriate of soda and sulphate of magnesia reacting, and being\r\n  converted into sulphate of soda and muriate of magnesia; a fact\r\n  evidently owing to the relation of the solubility of these salts to\r\n  temperature. Muriate of soda has its solubility scarcely altered,\r\n  either by heat or cold; sulphate of soda is, in these respects,\r\n  completely the reverse; hence at an elevated temperature, muriate of\r\n  soda is the least, and sulphate of soda the most soluble salt, whilst\r\n  at a low temperature, the reverse of this happens. All the\r\n  circumstances of this investigation are most interesting; the medical\r\n  practitioner will at once perceive its importance, as enabling him to\r\n  appreciate the real nature of saline solutions, and even in many\r\n  instances to preserve their identity. See Aquæ Minerales.\r\n\r\nFootnote 391:\r\n\r\n  There is a precaution respecting the preservation of these waters for\r\n  analysis with which the chemist ought to be acquainted; it will be\r\n  fully explained by the relation of the following anecdote. M. Wurza,\r\n  on examining some bottles of Chalybeate water, could detect no signs\r\n  of iron in them, and on seeking for the cause of this circumstance, he\r\n  discovered it in the astringent nature of the corks which had combined\r\n  with the metallic substance, and abstracted it from the water.\r\n\r\nFootnote 392:\r\n\r\n  The Mineral Springs in the United States more especially deserving of\r\n  notice, are those of Saratoga and Ballston in the State of New-York,\r\n  and of Schooley’s Mountain in New-Jersey. Of the two first, various\r\n  analyses have been published by different chemists, but with so little\r\n  uniformity of result as to leave their true chemical character still\r\n  in a state of uncertainty. An account of these discrepancies may be\r\n  seen in the New-England Journal of Medicine and Surgery for 1817. As\r\n  the analyses of Dr. Steel appear upon the whole to be most\r\n  satisfactory, we shall quote them. One gallon of the water was the\r\n  quantity used in the experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                BALLSTON.\r\n\r\n 1. _Public Spring._ Temperat. 50° Fahr.\r\n\r\n          Muriate of

It is to Mr. Higginbottom that we\r\n  are indebted for the full developement of this subject.—See “An Essay\r\n  on the use of Nitrate of Silver, in the cure of Inflammation, Wounds,\r\n  and Ulcers.” _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 397:\r\n\r\n  Horse-radish; horse-mint; bull-rush; &c.

Amongst other examples\r\n  of the truth of this observation, I lately saw in the manufactory at\r\n  the Soho at Birmingham, a man of more than fifty years of age, who had\r\n  soldered silver filligree for thirty-five years, and had regularly,\r\n  during that period, passed from eight to ten hours daily in his\r\n  occupation, and yet he was fat, strong, active, cheerful, and of a\r\n  complexion by no means sickly; neither he nor his brother artists use\r\n  any means to counteract the effect of their trade.” Dr. Rotheram, in a\r\n  letter to Dr. Percival, comments upon this fact, and says, “how far\r\n  the fluxes used in soldering the filligree may fix the parts of the\r\n  arsenic, or from what cause these workmen might escape, I dare not\r\n  say, but I should notwithstanding strongly suspect the fumes of this\r\n  very volatile and caustic mineral to be very prejudicial.”—I have\r\n  shewn above that arsenious acid is readily decomposed when heated in\r\n  contact with an oxidable metal, and I apprehend that this fact will\r\n  explain the reason why the fumes of the alloy in question are disarmed\r\n  of their virulence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 401:\r\n\r\n  In my work on Medical Jurisprudence, (Vol. ii. p. 216) the reader will\r\n  find a very full account of the symptoms produced by this poison.\r\n\r\nFootnote 402:\r\n\r\n  PLUNKETT’S OINTMENT, consists of arsenious acid, sulphur, and the\r\n  powdered flowers of the Ranunculus Flammula, and Cotula Fœtida,\r\n  levigated and made into a paste with the white of an egg, and applied,\r\n  on a piece of pig’s bladder, to the surface of the cancer.\r\n\r\n  PATE ARSENICALE. This favourite remedy of the French surgeons consists\r\n  of 70 parts of cinnabar, 22 of sanguis draconis, and 8 of arsenious\r\n  acid, made into paste with saliva, at the time of applying it. This\r\n  combination, observes a periodical writer, is similar, with the\r\n  exception of the ashes of the soles of old shoes, to that recommended\r\n  by Father Cosmo under the name of “Pulvis Anti-carcinomatosa.”\r\n\r\n  DAVIDSON’S REMEDY FOR CANCER, arsenious acid, and powdered hemlock.\r\n\r\nFootnote 403:\r\n\r\n  In the Journal de Medicine, the following case of a woman is related\r\n  who was killed by her husband having insinuated powdered arsenic into\r\n  the vagina, at the moment of enjoying the conjugal rites. “A woman at\r\n  Leneux, department de l’Ourthe, aged 40, having died after a short\r\n  illness, attended with considerable tumefaction of the genital parts,\r\n  uterine hemorrhage, vomiting, and purging, the body was inspected by\r\n  order of the mayor, when the surgeons reported that they found the\r\n  vulva in a state of gangrene, the abdomen much distended with air, and\r\n  the intestines inflamed and gangrenous. The culprit was arrested,\r\n  convicted, and executed.” In the Acts of the Society of Medicine of\r\n  Copenhagen, a similar crime is recorded, committed also by a peasant;\r\n  in this latter case, although some small pieces of arsenic were found\r\n  within the vagina, yet, some doubting the possibility of this species\r\n  of poisoning, the magistrates consulted the College of Medicine of\r\n  Copenhagen, who decided the question in the affirmative, by\r\n  instituting a series of experiments upon horses.\r\n\r\n  SINGLETON’S EYE SALVE, OR GOLDEN OINTMENT. Under this name is sold a\r\n  preparation which consists of sulphuret of arsenic (orpiment) with\r\n  lard, or spermaceti ointment.

This fashionable depilatory appears upon examination to\r\n  consist of Quick-lime and Sulphuret of Arsenic, with some vegetable\r\n  powder. It is, however, so unequally mixed, that in submitting it to\r\n  analysis, no two portions afforded the same results. It can scarcely\r\n  be necessary to state, that such a composition is incapable of\r\n  fulfilling the intention for which it is so confidently vended.\r\n\r\n  In Paris, arsenic forms the basis of several blistering cerates. Such\r\n  applications cannot be safe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 404:\r\n\r\n  This substance may be considered as consisting of charcoal, in a state\r\n  of extremely minute division, and the sub-carbonate of potass. It is\r\n  prepared by deflagrating, in a crucible, two parts of Super-tartrate\r\n  of Potass with one part of Nitrate of Potass.\r\n\r\nFootnote 405:\r\n\r\n  In order to close the end of the tube, where a blow-pipe is not to be\r\n  procured, the end is to be placed in a common fire, until it is\r\n  completely softened, and a pair of small tongs being at the same time\r\n  made red hot, the tube is to be withdrawn from the fire, and then\r\n  heated and pinched by the tongs, and at the same time bent up at an\r\n  acute angle, so as to be brought parallel to the body of the tube. The\r\n  tube is then to be heated a second time, and being again firmly\r\n  pinched by the hot tongs, the end will be found to be completely\r\n  impervious. Where a glass is not at hand Mr. R. Phillips says a common\r\n  draught phial may be made to answer the purpose, especially a _ten\r\n  drachm_ phial, for it is long in proportion to its diameter. In using\r\n  it, however, care must be taken that the suspected powder and black\r\n  flux do not reach the bottom, for, on account of its thickness, it\r\n  will readily break on the application of heat. The phial must\r\n  therefore be heated laterally by means of a spirit lamp.\r\n\r\nFootnote 406:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bostock has informed us that the best proportions for this coating\r\n  are one part of common pipe clay, to three parts of fine sand; which\r\n  are to be well kneaded together, and reduced to such a state of\r\n  tenacity that the lute will readily adhere to the tube, and its\r\n  different parts unite, without forming a visible seam, (Edinb. Med. &\r\n  Surg. Journ. April, 1809.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 407:\r\n\r\n  Should the operator be unable to procure a spirit lamp, a very\r\n  convenient substitute may be provided in the following manner. Let a\r\n  piece of tin plate, about an inch long, be coiled up into a cylinder\r\n  of about ⅜ths of an inch in diameter, and, if the edges be well\r\n  hammered, it is not necessary to use solder. Perforate a cork,\r\n  previously fitted to a phial, and put a cotton wick through the short\r\n  tin tube, and the tube through the cork. The lamp is now complete, and\r\n  will afford a strong flame, taking care of course not to prevent the\r\n  rise of the spirit by fitting the cork too closely.\r\n\r\nFootnote 408:\r\n\r\n  In the celebrated case of Kesler, who was tried in the state of\r\n  New-York some few years ago, for having poisoned his wife with\r\n  arsenic, this very question was agitated, and gave rise to much\r\n  learned controversy. The physicians originally called to examine the\r\n  body of the deceased, found, on dissection, the stomach and intestines\r\n  highly inflamed, and on the inner surface of the stomach, particles of\r\n  a vitreous appearance. These particles were subjected to various\r\n  chemical tests, all of which very strikingly concurred in confirming\r\n  the suspicion that they were arsenic. Upon this, in connexion with the\r\n  other testimony adduced in the case, the prisoner was found guilty and\r\n  condemned to death. The minutes of the trial were transmitted by the\r\n  presiding judge (Yates) to Governor Clinton, who submitted the\r\n  professional part of them to Dr. M‘Nevin of New-York, for his opinion\r\n  in relation to it. Thus called upon, Dr. M. seems to have considered\r\n  that his only duty was to find fault. Objections were accordingly\r\n  raised against every test hitherto employed by the best chemists for\r\n  the detection of arsenic. They were all pronounced to be uncertain,\r\n  and “_the only thing to be relied on_,” according to him, was “_the\r\n  exhibition of the metal itself in its metallic lustre and state_.” In\r\n  consequence of this difference of opinion, the execution of Kesler was\r\n  suspended by the Governor, and the whole case referred by him to the\r\n  Legislature. That distinguished body appointed a committee to\r\n  investigate the business, and the result was that the original verdict\r\n  of the jury was confirmed by the Legislature, and the criminal was\r\n  executed. It must furnish a source of the purest gratification to the\r\n  medical witnesses concerned in this case, to find their opinions so\r\n  unequivocally and so justly confirmed by an authority so high as Dr.\r\n  Paris. For a detailed account of this trial we refer to Beck’s Medical\r\n  Jurisprudence, vol. 2, p. 239.—_Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 409:\r\n\r\n  If any trifling opacity occur in a simple solution of arsenic, when\r\n  assayed by the nitrate of silver, it may be considered as the effects\r\n  of some casual impurities; this is further demonstrated by bringing\r\n  over the surface of the arsenical liquid, a piece of blotting paper,\r\n  or a stopper, moistened with a solution of ammonia, when there will\r\n  instantly form a copious yellow precipitate of arsenite of silver. If\r\n  this experiment be performed on a surface of glass, laid over white\r\n  paper, the result is very striking and beautiful.\r\n\r\nFootnote 410:\r\n\r\n  Annals of Philosophy, vol. x, p. 60.\r\n\r\nFootnote 411:\r\n\r\n  London Medical and Physical Journal, January, 1818.\r\n\r\nFootnote 412:\r\n\r\n  In Wine and Porter, the solvent is probably Tartaric acid, for the\r\n  Arsenite of Silver is soluble in this as well as in the acetic and\r\n  nitric acids. In Tea the solvent would appear to be Tannin. The\r\n  Arsenite of Silver is likewise dissolved by the Tartaric acid, and\r\n  also, but not so readily, by the Citric and Acetic acids.\r\n\r\nFootnote 413:\r\n\r\n  This opinion has lately received ample confirmation from the\r\n  experiments of Dr. Christison, (Edinb. Med. and Surg. Journal, July,\r\n  1824) who has shewn that the process of Orfila is objectionable on the\r\n  three following grounds, viz.\r\n\r\n  1st. The colour is very seldom so entirely destroyed but that the\r\n  precipitates produced by some of the tests still deviate to a certain\r\n  degree from their characteristic tints; and although the colour of the\r\n  fluid be even destroyed entirely, it often re-appears in the\r\n  precipitates.\r\n\r\n  2d. Although the Chlorine destroys the colour, it does not also take\r\n  from the fluid its solvent action on the arsenical precipitates.\r\n\r\n  3d. In fluids decolorized by Chlorine, and containing no Arsenic, some\r\n  of the tests produce precipitates, not only precisely the same with\r\n  those which they cause in the decolorized solutions of Arsenic, but\r\n  likewise very similar in appearance to those caused in a pure aqueous\r\n  solution of Arsenic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 414:\r\n\r\n  The experiments by which I ascertained this fact were made soon after\r\n  the publication of Mr. Phillips’s paper, and long before I saw Dr.\r\n  Christison’s communication in the Edinburgh Journal. I merely mention\r\n  this circumstance to add greater weight to the experimental evidence,\r\n  for when different persons arrive at the same conclusion without any\r\n  communication with each other, the strongest possible testimony is\r\n  afforded. I may also add that my suspicions were raised to the\r\n  probability of the fact by a knowledge of the action of charcoal upon\r\n  lime water. In a philosophical point of view the fact is one of great\r\n  interest; it seems to connect the phenomena of mechanical and chemical\r\n  attraction. We have evidently a body removed from the state of\r\n  solution by mechanical means.\r\n\r\nFootnote 415:\r\n\r\n  The following is the formula for its preparation. Dissolve ten grains\r\n  of lunar caustic in ten times its weight of distilled water, to this\r\n  add, _guttatim_, liquid ammonia, until a precipitate is formed:\r\n  continue cautiously to add the ammonia, repeatedly agitating the\r\n  mixture until the precipitate is nearly redissolved. The object of\r\n  allowing a small portion to remain undissolved is to guard against an\r\n  excess of ammonia. Wherever the test is used, the liquid to which it\r\n  is added ought to be quite cold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 416:\r\n\r\n  This is very important, for an excess of ammonia redissolves the\r\n  yellow precipitate, and therefore defeats the object of the test. The\r\n  fixed alkalies, in excess, have not such a property.\r\n\r\nFootnote 417:\r\n\r\n  The great impression made upon the public mind in Cornwall, by the\r\n  above trial, produced a disposition to regard the cause of every\r\n  sudden death with more than usual jealousy. See a Report of this trial\r\n  in the Appendix of our work on Medical Jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nFootnote 418:\r\n\r\n  In consequence of a report having arisen that a young woman had died\r\n  after an illness of forty-eight hours, and been hastily buried at\r\n  Madron, the magistrates of that district issued their warrant for the\r\n  disinterment of the body, and requested my attendance at the\r\n  examination. It appeared upon dissection that the immediate cause of\r\n  death had been inflammation of the intestines; the stomach was found\r\n  to contain a considerable portion of liquid, which was carefully\r\n  collected and examined; no solid matter could be discovered in it. It\r\n  appeared to consist principally of the remains of a quantity of\r\n  penny-royal tea, which had been the last thing administered to the\r\n  deceased. This was divided into several portions, and placed in\r\n  separate wine glasses, and submitted, in the presence of the sheriff\r\n  and other gentlemen, to a series of experiments, amongst which the\r\n  following may be particularized, as bearing upon the question at\r\n  issue.\r\n\r\n  1st. A few drops of a solution of sub-carbonate of potass were added\r\n  to the liquid, in one of the glasses, when its colour, which was\r\n  before of a light hazel, was instantly deepened into a reddish yellow;\r\n  the sulphate of copper was then applied, when a precipitate fell down,\r\n  which every one present immediately pronounced to be of a _vivid\r\n  green_ hue, but in pouring off the supernatant liquid, and\r\n  transferring the precipitate upon white paper, it assumed a blue\r\n  colour, without the least tinge of green; the explanation of the\r\n  phenomenon, and the fallacy to which it gave rise, was obvious: the\r\n  yellow colour, imparted to the liquid by the alkali, was the effect of\r\n  that body upon vegetable extract, and will generally take place on\r\n  adding it to the infusions of vegetable substances.\r\n\r\n  2nd. To another portion of the liquid, the ammoniaco-nitrate of silver\r\n  was added; a slight turbidness arose, but no yellow precipitate\r\n  occurred.\r\n\r\n  3rd. After adding a fixed alkali, the surface of the liquid was\r\n  touched with a stick of lunar caustic, but no yellow precipitate was\r\n  produced.\r\n\r\n  4th. The liquid was next assayed in a watch-glass, for a phosphate of\r\n  soda, by endeavouring to form a triple salt with magnesia and ammonia,\r\n  as suggested by Dr. Wollaston; the result proved that phosphate of\r\n  soda was not present. It is unnecessary to pursue the relation of the\r\n  experiments; I conceive that sufficient evidence has been adduced to\r\n  establish the truth of the explanation. I have frequently repeated the\r\n  first experiment, substituting for the gastric infusion, a decoction\r\n  of onions, and with similar results.\r\n\r\nFootnote 419:\r\n\r\n  This explanation applies equally to the objection lately advanced by\r\n  Dr. Porter, of the University of South Carolina, who in observing on\r\n  the tests for arsenic, remarks, that an appearance similar to\r\n  Scheele’s Green, is produced by the carbonate of potass when added to\r\n  a solution of copper containing coffee, but without arsenic, more\r\n  striking than if a weak solution of arsenic be used. Silliman’s\r\n  Journal, iii. 365.\r\n\r\nFootnote 420:\r\n\r\n  Annals of Philosophy, New Series, No. III. for March, 1821.\r\n\r\nFootnote 421:\r\n\r\n  The habitudes of arsenious acid with the nitrates were first observed\r\n  by Kunkel; nitrous vapour is disengaged, part of the oxygen being\r\n  absorbed by the arsenious acid, by which an arsenite of potass is\r\n  formed.\r\n\r\nFootnote 422:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Bostock confesses that where less than three-fourths of a grain\r\n  were used, he could not say that the metallic crust was clearly\r\n  perceptible; and Dr. Black considered that one grain was the smallest\r\n  quantity which could be distinctly recognised by such a process. Dr.\r\n  Jaeger (Dissertatio Inauguralis, Stuttgard, 1808) also observes, that\r\n  he has been enabled to recognise the tenth of a grain of arsenious\r\n  acid, although mixed with sugar, by its odour, when thrown upon\r\n  burning coals! I must be allowed to question this fact; Dr. Jaeger, no\r\n  doubt, believed that he recognised the alliaceous odour, but it must\r\n  have been the effect of imagination. Dr. Bostock observes that, if\r\n  Arsenic be mixed with either an animal or vegetable substance, the\r\n  smoke and smell arising from those bodies, when heated, will\r\n  altogether prevent our recognising its odour. He found that when a\r\n  quantity of Arsenic was mixed with an equal weight of flour, and\r\n  placed upon iron at a low red heat, so as not to cause the flour to\r\n  inflame, the suffocating smoke that arose from the latter could be\r\n  alone perceived; nor was it possible to discover that any thing had\r\n  been mixed with it (Edinb. Med. Journal.) This objection of Dr.\r\n  Bostock is true in fact, although it admits of a different\r\n  explanation, for at a low temperature the Arsenious acid would be\r\n  volatilized without decomposition; in which case no alliaceous odour\r\n  can be developed. Dr. Traill has lately asserted (Annals of\r\n  Philosophy, Feb. 1824) that he has recognised the alliaceous odour\r\n  during the volatilization of 1/78th of a grain of the metal. I do not\r\n  question the truth of this assertion, but there must have been an\r\n  address in the manipulation which we cannot expect to find in ordinary\r\n  experimenters.\r\n\r\nFootnote 423:\r\n\r\n  Assafœtida was used by the ancients as a condiment, under the name of\r\n  σιλφὶον, _Laserpitium_, (Pliny); and according to Kempfer, the\r\n  Persians use it for the same purpose. The Arabian writers on the\r\n  materia medica class this article among their Mobehyat\r\n  (_Aphrodisiaca_). The term Assafœtida is derived from the monks of the\r\n  Salernian school; some of the writers of the middle ages call it Opium\r\n  Cyrenaicum, i. e. the Juice from Cyrene.\r\n\r\nFootnote 424:\r\n\r\n  TOLU LOZENGES.

For the removal of pain and flatulence in the bowels,\r\n  which may be enumerated among the most frequent and distressing\r\n  symptoms of the first stage of indigestion, Calamus is superior to any\r\n  other carminative; by virtue of its aroma it creates a strong\r\n  sensation of warmth in the stomach, increasing its action without\r\n  sensibly augmenting the force of the circulation, while its powerful\r\n  bitter principle gives permanent tone to the relaxed state of the\r\n  fibres.” New-York Med. & Phys.

The medicinal\r\n  virtues of this insect were first discovered in 1797, and found to be\r\n  fully equal to those of the Spanish fly. Dr. Barton says “from\r\n  frequent employment of the two articles, I cannot hesitate to prefer\r\n  the American to the foreign fly. Long keeping, provided it be\r\n  carefully kept, does not materially impair the blistering property of\r\n  the Lytta vittata.

Many cases\r\n  have yielded to it which had resisted every other cathartic medicine\r\n  previously used. Dr. Daniell, of Savannah, to whom we are indebted for\r\n  an interesting paper on this subject, states as the result of his\r\n  experience, “that the most speedy, as well as the most certain relief,\r\n  is to be obtained from the free use of Charcoal. If it does not wholly\r\n  relieve, it always very much mitigates the pain in six or eight hours\r\n  from the period of its first administration; and within my\r\n  observation,” he adds, “the patient has always been entirely composed\r\n  before the operation of the medicine upon the bowels.” “In relation to\r\n  the dose of this medicine,” he states that “the rule which I have\r\n  pursued is to give it as freely and as frequently as the stomach will\r\n  allow. The quantity required is considerable. It has a happy influence\r\n  in lulling the irritability of the stomach, when nothing else which I\r\n  have used, would control the nausea and vomiting of the patient; thus\r\n  fulfilling the double intention of first alleviating a very\r\n  distressing symptom, and then removing the disease itself. I usually\r\n  give from one to three table-spoonsful of Charcoal every half hour or\r\n  hour: whenever the stomach becomes overcharged with the medicine, the\r\n  excess is thrown off, and the stomach is again quiet. I give it in\r\n  lime water, milk, or water alone—the vehicle having appeared to me\r\n  unimportant.” Philadel. Journal of Med. and Phys. Science, Vol. 5. p.\r\n  120.

It is highly necessary that the public should\r\n  know that the preparation sold under this empirical title, has no\r\n  relation whatever to the late discoveries of Pelletier. It is merely\r\n  an extract prepared by macerating the bruised substance of bark in\r\n  cold water, and submitting the infusion to a very slow evaporation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 462:\r\n\r\n  The designation of Cinchonin, consistent with the principles of\r\n  chemical nomenclature, must now have a termination in _a_, and the\r\n  name Cinchonia appears preferable to that of Cinchonina.\r\n\r\nFootnote 463:\r\n\r\n  The following is the process by which Cinchonia may be prepared. Take\r\n  a pound of Pale Bark, bruised small, and boil it for an hour in three\r\n  pints of a very dilute solution of pure Potass. After the liquid has\r\n  cooled, it must be strained through a fine cloth with pressure, and\r\n  the residuum be repeatedly washed and pressed. The cinchona, thus\r\n  washed, is to be slightly heated in a sufficient quantity of water,\r\n  adding muriatic acid gradually until litmus paper is slightly\r\n  reddened. When the liquid is raised nearly to the boiling point, it is\r\n  to be strained, and the cinchona again pressed. To the strained\r\n  liquor, while hot, add an ounce of sulphate of magnesia, and after\r\n  this add a solution of potass, till it ceases to occasion any\r\n  precipitate. When the liquor is cold, collect the precipitate on a\r\n  filtre, wash and dry it, and dissolve it in hot alcohol. On\r\n  evaporation of the spirit, the cinchona will crystallize.\r\n\r\nFootnote 464:\r\n\r\n  Thus, as we have stated, 100 parts of Cinchonia unite with 13·021 of\r\n  Sulphuric acid, while the same weight of Quina requires for saturation\r\n  not more than 10·91 of the same acid.\r\n\r\nFootnote 465:\r\n\r\n  SULPHATE OF QUINA. As this preparation is considered the most active\r\n  form of the salifiable principle of bark, I have subjoined the most\r\n  approved formula for its preparation. Boil for half an hour two pounds\r\n  of the appropriate bark in powder, in sixteen pints of distilled\r\n  water, acidulated with two fluid-ounces of sulphuric acid; strain the\r\n  decoction through a linen cloth, and submit the residue to a second\r\n  ebullition in a similar quantity of acidulated water; mix the\r\n  decoctions, and add by small portions at a time, powdered lime,\r\n  constantly stirring it to facilitate its action on the acid decoction.\r\n  (Half a pound is near the quantity requisite.) When the decoction has\r\n  become slightly alkaline it assumes a dark brown colour, and deposits\r\n  a reddish brown flocculent precipitate, which is to be separated by\r\n  passing it through a linen cloth. The precipitate, is to be washed\r\n  with a little cold distilled water and dried. When dry it is to be\r\n  digested in rectified spirit, with a moderate heat for some hours; the\r\n  liquid is then to be decanted, and fresh portions of spirit added till\r\n  it no longer acquires a bitter taste. Unite the spirituous tinctures,\r\n  and distil in a water-bath till three fourths of the spirit employed\r\n  has distilled over. After this operation there remains in the vessel a\r\n  brown viscid substance covered by a bitter, very alkaline and milky\r\n  fluid. The two products are to be separated and treated as follows. To\r\n  the alkaline liquid add a sufficient quantity of sulphuric acid to\r\n  saturate it; reduce it by evaporation to half the quantity; add a\r\n  small portion of charcoal, and after some minutes ebullition, filter\r\n  it whilst hot, and crystals of Sulphate of Quina will form. The brown\r\n  mass is to be boiled in a small quantity of water, slightly acidulated\r\n  with sulphuric acid, which will convert a large portion of it into\r\n  Sulphate of Quina. The crystals are to be dried by bibulous paper. Two\r\n  pounds of bark will, it is said, yield 5 to 6 drachms of the sulphate;\r\n  of which eight grains are considered equivalent to an ounce of bark.\r\n  It has been prepared in this country by several manufacturing\r\n  chemists, especially by Mr. Pope of Oxford Street, whose zeal and\r\n  industry in Pharmaceutic experiments entitle him to great\r\n  commendation. The superior price of the bark, however, from the duty\r\n  in this country, as well as that of alcohol, must prevent us from\r\n  entering into competition with the French in its manufacture, and it\r\n  has accordingly been found more œconomical to import, than to prepare\r\n  it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 466:\r\n\r\n  Journal de Physiologie. No. 1, p. 90.\r\n\r\nFootnote 467:\r\n\r\n  Upon this point however a difference of opinion has existed; M. Halle\r\n  entertained considerable fears on the subject, which were supported by\r\n  M. M. Larrey, Emery, Duponchel, and others, who communicated to the\r\n  Société Médicale d’Emulation, facts which excited their apprehensions.\r\n  The question, however, has been set at rest both in this country and\r\n  on the Continent. They are perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\nFootnote 468:\r\n\r\n  Cinchonia has been detected in other vegetables besides the Bark, as\r\n  in the root of Cusparia, and in the berries of Capsicum, while in the\r\n  bark of Cascarilla, a substance bearing a much nearer relation in\r\n  medicinal effect to the Bark, its presence has not yet been\r\n  discovered. It is said that experiments have been lately made by M. M.\r\n  Robiquet and Petroz on the Bark of the Carapa, which has been\r\n  successfully used in several parts of America in the cure of agues,\r\n  and that they have found in that bark a salifiable basis analogous to\r\n  Quina.\r\n\r\nFootnote 469:\r\n\r\n  In Brande’s Journal for January 1830, it is announced that Serturner\r\n  has discovered other vegeto-alkalies in the Bark, besides the\r\n  Cinchonia and Quinia.—One in particular he has ascertained, which he\r\n  calls _Chinioidia_, existing in combination with a resinous sub-acid\r\n  substance. This exists in the red and yellow bark with the Cinchonia\r\n  and Quinia. It has more alkaline power and capacity of saturation, as\r\n  well as greater medical power than any other vegeto-alkali in the\r\n  Cinchona, but it resembles them in its insolubility in water, its\r\n  colour and taste. According to Serturner, the febrifuge power of the\r\n  _Chinioidia_ is as superior to that of the Cinchonia and Quinia as\r\n  these are to the Bark.—In his hands it succeeded in many cases where\r\n  the Sulphate of Quinia had failed. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 470:\r\n\r\n  It was under this form that the celebrated empiric Talbor used to\r\n  administer it in the paroxysms of Intermittents, and so successful was\r\n  his practice, that Louis XIV. was induced to purchase at a large price\r\n  the secret of his specific; and Charles the Second very unjustly\r\n  protected him against the power of the College, and appointed him one\r\n  of his physicians.\r\n\r\nFootnote 471:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Thompson has suggested the probability of this circumstance having\r\n  arisen from the admixture of a species of bark, lately introduced into\r\n  Europe from Martinique, resembling the Cinchona Floribunda, and which,\r\n  by an analysis of M. Cadet, was found to contain iron. (London Disp.\r\n  Edit. 3. p. 247.)\r\n\r\nFootnote 472:\r\n\r\n  This plant is found in abundance in Piedmont, principally in the\r\n  marshes, where of course it is most needed. Nature is very kind in\r\n  this respect, for the particular situation which engenders endemic\r\n  diseases, is generally congenial to the growth of the plants that\r\n  operate as antidotes to them.\r\n\r\nFootnote 473:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Davy, in a letter to me upon this subject, says, “there are two\r\n  kinds of oil of cinnamon procured in Ceylon, one of greater, the other\r\n  of less specific gravity than water. In distillation they come over\r\n  together. On what the difference depends I do not know, nor am I aware\r\n  that the subject has yet been investigated.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 474:\r\n\r\n  From experiments made with _Veratria_, it appears that its effects on\r\n  the human system are analogous to those of the Colchicum itself. In\r\n  chronic rheumatism comparative trials to a great extent were\r\n  instituted by Dr. Bardsley, and with very similar results. The\r\n  _Veratria_ was generally administered in doses of from 1/4 gr. to ½\r\n  gr. three times a day. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 475:\r\n\r\n  With this opinion Mr. A. T. Thomson coincides, for in the 3d edition\r\n  of his Dispensatory, he says, “the thick old bulb begins to decay\r\n  after the flower is perfectly expanded, and the new bulbs, of which\r\n  there are always two formed on each old bulb, are perfected in the\r\n  following June; from which time until the middle of August, they may\r\n  be taken up for medicinal use.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 476:\r\n\r\n  EAU MEDICINALE DE HUSSON.

The following is the\r\n  receipt for preparing this medicine.

On dissection, most of the viscera, more\r\n  especially the brain and intestines, exhibited great sanguineous\r\n  turgescence, and appearances of inflammation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 478:\r\n\r\n  This preparation, or the Seeds, may be procured for trial, from the\r\n  house of Savory, Moore, and Davidson, of New Bond Street.\r\n\r\nFootnote 479:\r\n\r\n  WARD was originally a footman, and, during his attendance upon his\r\n  master on the Continent, obtained from the Monks those receipts which\r\n  afterwards became his nostrums. It may be observed that this\r\n  Confection appears to be well adapted for the cure of that species of\r\n  Piles which probably attended the sedentary and luxurious habits of\r\n  the monks.\r\n\r\nFootnote 480:\r\n\r\n  Dr. Chapman recommends the liberal use of the Copaiva in the very\r\n  commencement of Gonorrhœa, disregarding ardor ruinæ, chordee, and\r\n  every other symptom of inflammation that may be present. Than this, we\r\n  do not know a medical precept more erroneous in theory, or more\r\n  mischievous in practice. We are convinced that a great majority of\r\n  gleets may be traced to the premature use of balsam Copaiva, and other\r\n  stimulating articles in the inflammatory stage of the disease.—_Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 481:\r\n\r\n  Cūbĕba—Indis Cubab; Avicennæ Kebâba.

This belief\r\n  is mentioned by Dioscorides; and Pliny informs us that the disciples\r\n  of Porcius Latro, a famous master of the art of speaking, were\r\n  reported to have used Cumin, in order to imitate that paleness which\r\n  their master had contracted by his studies; thus too Horace,\r\n\r\n                    ——Proh si\r\n     “Pallerem casu, biberent exsangue Cuminum.”\r\n                                         Epist. 19. Lib. 1, lin: 18.\r\n\r\nFootnote 485:\r\n\r\n  It may be here observed that Copper, in its metallic form, exerts no\r\n  action on the system. A most striking instance of this fact occurred\r\n  during my hospital practice, in the case of a young woman who\r\n  swallowed six copper penny-pieces with a view of destroying herself;\r\n  she was attended by Dr. Maton and myself in the Westminster Hospital\r\n  for two years, for a disease which we considered visceral, but which\r\n  was evidently the effect of mechanical obstruction, occasioned by the\r\n  coin. After a lapse of five years she voided them, and then confessed\r\n  the cause of her protracted disease, during the whole course of which\r\n  no symptom arose which could in any way be attributed to the poisonous\r\n  influence of copper. Dr. Baillie, in his morbid anatomy, relates a\r\n  case, in which five halfpence had been lodged in a pouch in the\r\n  stomach, for a considerable time, without occasioning any irritation;\r\n  and Theodore Gardelle, after his conviction for the murder of Mrs.\r\n  King, in Leicester Square, swallowed a number of halfpence, for the\r\n  purpose of destroying himself, but without producing any ill effects.\r\n  Mr. A. T. Thomson relates also two cases of halfpence being swallowed\r\n  by children, in one of which the copper coin remained six months in\r\n  the intestines, and in the other two months. The filings of copper\r\n  were formerly a favorite remedy in rheumatism, a drachm of which has\r\n  been taken with impunity for a dose. It appears therefore that\r\n  metallic copper does not undergo any change in the digestive organs by\r\n  which it is converted into a poison, notwithstanding the presence of\r\n  substances, which, out of the body, would at once render it\r\n  destructive, as we have too many cases to shew, from the careless use\r\n  of copper utensils in cookery. It is, however, a very important fact,\r\n  that copper cannot be dissolved while tin is co-existent in the\r\n  mixture, hence the great use of tinning copper utensils; and farther,\r\n  it is asserted that untinned coppers are less liable to be injurious\r\n  when pewter spoons are used for stirring, than when silver ones are\r\n  employed for that purpose; the explanation of this fact is to be\r\n  sought for in the well-known principle of Electro-Chemistry, and which\r\n  has lately been applied with so much ingenuity by the illustrious\r\n  President of the Royal Society, for the protection of copper on the\r\n  bottom of ships, by the juxta-position of small discs of Tin or\r\n  Iron.[486] For the same reason, M. Proust has shewn that the tinning\r\n  of kitchen utensils, which consists of equal parts of tin and lead,\r\n  cannot be dangerous from the presence of the latter metal, since it is\r\n  sufficient that the lead should be combined with tin, in order to\r\n  prevent it from being dissolved in any vegetable acid. M. Guersent\r\n  therefore is wrong when, speaking of the tinning of copper vessels, he\r\n  says, “it is a light veil, which conceals the danger, instead of being\r\n  a true preservative, and that it only inspires a security often\r\n  fatal.” Some recent experiments however, of Dr. Bostock, have shewn\r\n  that, in consequence of the volatility of acetic acid, copper is not\r\n  protected by the juxta-position of discs of tin; since the acid under\r\n  such circumstances ceases to form a part of the galvanic circle. The\r\n  poisonous effects of the _salts_ of Copper have been strikingly\r\n  illustrated during the prosecution of Sir H. Davy’s experiments above\r\n  alluded to, for it is found that when the copper sheathing of ships is\r\n  not protected by the contact of another metal, they are uniformly free\r\n  from marine animals, but that where the solution of the copper is\r\n  prevented by galvanic action, the bottoms soon become covered with\r\n  every species of sea insect.\r\n\r\nFootnote 486:\r\n\r\n  For a further explanation of this curious fact the student may consult\r\n  my work on Medical Chemistry.\r\n\r\nFootnote 487:\r\n\r\n  BATES’S AQUA CAMPHORATA.—Sulphate of copper is the base of this\r\n  preparation, which was strongly recommended by Mr. Ware.

Allen &. Co. according to the\r\n  improved process of Dr. Clutterbuck; of the first sample, he found\r\n  that out of ten grains, 5·5 were soluble in spirit of the specific\r\n  gravity ·809, of the second 6·2, and of the third 6·4; of that\r\n  prepared by the same process at Apothecaries’ Hall, 6 grs. were\r\n  soluble. The residue, insoluble in the spirit, was administered to a\r\n  patient, and ascertained to be perfectly inert. This report confirms\r\n  beyond a doubt the great superiority of the Elaterium when prepared,\r\n  without pressure, according to the suggestion of Dr. Clutterbuck.\r\n\r\nFootnote 505:\r\n\r\n  “I have the Cos Lettuce planted about eight inches asunder in rows,\r\n  between which there is sufficient space to enable persons to pass up\r\n  and down without injuring the plants. I commence my operations just\r\n  before the plant is about to flower, by cutting off an inch of the\r\n  stem; the milky juice immediately exudes, and is collected on pieces\r\n  of Wove Cotton, about half a yard square. As soon as this becomes\r\n  charged, it is thrown from time to time into a vessel containing a\r\n  small quantity of water, which when sufficiently impregnated is\r\n  evaporated at the common temperature of the atmosphere, by exposure in\r\n  a number of shallow dishes. The LACTUCARIUM, in a few hours, is found\r\n  adhering to the vessels in the form of an Extract, but differing from\r\n  every other in all its sensible properties: this method enables me to\r\n  collect LACTUCARIUM with great facility and dispatch, but it is still\r\n  attended with considerable expense, as the proportion of milky product\r\n  is necessarily very small, and the price of the medicine consequently\r\n  high, and therefore not within the reach of general practice. This\r\n  consideration led me to make farther experiments, for the purpose of\r\n  ascertaining whether an EXTRACT might not be obtained from the plant\r\n  possessing all the properties of LACTUCARIUM, when administered in\r\n  large doses, and which could be introduced at a comparatively trifling\r\n  cost. In prosecuting this enquiry, I found that the plants contain\r\n  most of the milky juice when they have flowered and the leaves are\r\n  beginning to assume a yellow hue, and I observed that when cut down,\r\n  the milky juice assumes for the most part a concrete form, having\r\n  subsided in the bark of the stalk and in the old leaves, a\r\n  circumstance which accounts for the extreme bitterness of these parts.\r\n  I was naturally led from these circumstances to choose the above\r\n  period for my operations, and to select those parts only of the plant\r\n  for my extract, rejecting the substance of the stalk, and the young\r\n  sprouts. My method of procuring the extract is as follows. I first\r\n  macerate the parts in water, for twenty-four hours, and then boil them\r\n  for two, after which I allow the clear decoction to drain through a\r\n  sieve, without using any pressure; this is then evaporated, as far as\r\n  it can be done with safety, and the process is finished in shallow\r\n  dishes, in the manner above described, for obtaining Lactucarium. This\r\n  extract, which I have called “EXTRACTUM LACTUCÆ CONCENTRATUM,” is of\r\n  course less powerful than Lactucarium, but it possesses all the\r\n  properties in larger doses, and it has been found equally useful in a\r\n  number and variety of cases, and is not more than a sixth part of the\r\n  price.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Probart has retired from trade, but I have just learnt that the\r\n  same article is now prepared, by a similar process, by Mr. Selway,\r\n  Chemist, of New Cavendish Street, and the specimens which I have\r\n  received authorise me to recommend it for trial. A concentrated\r\n  tincture is also prepared.\r\n\r\n  The “Succus Spissatus Lactucæ sativæ,” of the shops, must of necessity\r\n  be almost inert, since it is commonly prepared at that period when the\r\n  plant contains none, or very little of the milky juice; and even if\r\n  the Lettuce be employed at a more mature season, it must still fail to\r\n  afford an extract of any strength, as it is merely the expressed\r\n  juice, and that too of the whole plant indiscriminately, and will be\r\n  found to contain a very minute proportion of Lactucarium, the great\r\n  bulk being nothing more than inspissated green juice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 506:\r\n\r\n  Doctor Eights of Albany has related two cases of Neuralgia, in which\r\n  the use of the Carbonate of Iron was attended with complete success.\r\n  See New-York Medical and Physical Journal, Vol. I. p. 323.\r\n\r\n                                                                     ED.\r\n\r\nFootnote 507:\r\n\r\n  This fact furnishes the Pharmaceutic Chemist with an easy and\r\n  effectual mode of cleansing the green crystals from the yellow\r\n  peroxide which forms upon their surface, viz. by washing them in\r\n  spirit.\r\n\r\nFootnote 508:\r\n\r\n  By a parity of reasoning, Mr. Carmichael is led to prefer the\r\n  phosphate of iron to any other preparation of that metal, in cancer,\r\n  because he thinks iron, combined with an animal acid, enters the\r\n  system in greater quantity, and unites more intimately with the\r\n  juices.\r\n\r\n  AROMATIC LOZENGES OF STEEL.

This popular remedy as a lotion for Aphthæ and other\r\n  similar diseases, I am well satisfied possesses considerable efficacy.\r\n  It may, perhaps, be necessary to state that Forge-water is that in\r\n  which the Blacksmith has plunged his hot iron, for the purpose of\r\n  refrigeration. It is to be taken early in the morning, when, all the\r\n  mechanical impurities having had time to subside, it is beautifully\r\n  limpid. Upon examining some of this water I found it to contain\r\n  sulphate of iron. The sulphuric acid was probably derived from the\r\n  sulphur of the coals.\r\n\r\nFootnote 510:\r\n\r\n  Besides the preparations of Iron mentioned by our author, there is\r\n  another which has recently been introduced into practice, by Dr.\r\n  Zollickhoffer of Maryland, and this is the _Prussiate of Iron_, or\r\n  _Prussian Blue_. Like the other forms of iron it acts as a powerful\r\n  tonic, and as a remedy in intermitting and remitting fevers, Dr. Z.\r\n  conceives it to possess many advantages over Cinchona. These he states\r\n  to be the following: “1. It is void of taste, and may therefore be\r\n  much more readily exhibited than the Cinchona Officinalis, which to\r\n  some is extremely unpleasant. 2. It may be given in every stage of the\r\n  disease, while the administration of bark is confined to the apyrexiæ.\r\n  4. The dose is much smaller, being from four to six grains twice or\r\n  thrice in twenty-four hours; or at morning, noon and night; while\r\n  bark, to be effectual, must be given in much larger doses. 4. It never\r\n  disagrees with the stomach, or creates nausea, even in the most\r\n  irritable state of this viscus; while bark is not unfrequently\r\n  rejected. 5. In its effects as a remedy calculated to prevent the\r\n  recurrence of future paroxysms, it is more certain, prompt, and\r\n  effectual, than the justly celebrated Cort. Peruvian. 6 and lastly, A\r\n  patient treated with this article will recover from the influence of\r\n  intermitting and remitting fevers, in the generality of cases, in much\r\n  less time than is usual in those cases in which bark is employed.” In\r\n  using the Prussiate of Iron, Dr. Zollickhoffer directs that care\r\n  should be taken to select that which is of a very dark blue colour,\r\n  approaching to a black, having a shining coppery fracture, and\r\n  adhering firmly to the tongue.\r\n\r\n                                                                     ED.\r\n\r\nFootnote 511:\r\n\r\n  MATHIEU’S VERMIFUGE.

Their inventor, if I am\r\n  rightly informed, resides at Ipswich, where, for the benefit of\r\n  suffering humanity, he prepares these wonderful pills, and, with the\r\n  alacrity of his patron deity, Mercury, transmits them to every corner\r\n  of the United Kingdom. It appears from the printed directions which\r\n  accompany the “Restorative Pills,” that their use must be continued\r\n  for a very long period; but upon this occasion we must allow the\r\n  Doctor to speak for himself. “It may be necessary to observe, that in\r\n  some cases of Scrofula, especially when the seat of the disease is in\r\n  the feet, ancles, or hands, it may take a long time to effect a cure,\r\n  even two years, and it may be twelve or sixteen months, with seeming\r\n  little or no improvement, yet the cure is certain by perseverance.”\r\n  What—two years! and to be taken during a period of sixteen months\r\n  without any sensible benefit! Is it possible that persons can be found\r\n  with sufficient credulity and resolution to submit to so preposterous\r\n  a proposal? we have no doubt that Mr. Chamberlain can produce as great\r\n  a portion of cures _after_ such an ordeal, as was adduced in former\r\n  times, in proof of the efficacy of the Royal Touch, and for the same\r\n  obvious reason. (See page 16.)\r\n\r\n  Upon examining these said pills, I find them to consist of Cinnabar,\r\n  Sulphur, Sulphate of Lime, and a little vegetable matter, perhaps gum.\r\n  Each pill weighs a fraction less than three grains; upon dividing one\r\n  with a penknife, and examining the cut surface through a lens, it\r\n  exhibited the appearance of scoriæ of a brick red colour, having small\r\n  yellowish masses imbedded in its substance. When exposed on a piece of\r\n  platinum foil to the action of the blow-pipe, it yielded vapours of a\r\n  strong sulphureous smell, and left a residuum of a pearly white\r\n  matter, which consisted almost entirely of Sulphate of Lime. Upon\r\n  submitting a portion of the pill, in a glass tube, to the heat of a\r\n  spirit lamp, two distinct sublimates were produced, the first\r\n  consisting of Sulphur, the second of Cinnabar; and a small\r\n  carbonaceous deposit remained. The Pill was then assayed, _via\r\n  humida_; distilled water dissolved the Sulphate of lime, which was\r\n  identified by appropriate tests, and left sulphur and cinnabar on the\r\n  filtre. By the above experiments I feel warranted in considering the\r\n  composition of this pill as fully ascertained.\r\n\r\n  BOERHAAVE’S RED PILL. The basis of this nostrum is Cinnabar.\r\n\r\nFootnote 534:\r\n\r\n  The anatomist employs it for giving colour to his injections; for this\r\n  purpose it is very essential that it should be quite free from red\r\n  lead, or his preparations will in a short time lose their splendour,\r\n  and ultimately become black. This has unfortunately happened with some\r\n  preparations which Dr. Baillie presented to the College of Physicians.\r\n  Mr. Accum, in his work entitled “Death in the Pot,” states a case of\r\n  poisoning from cheese which had been coloured with adulterated\r\n  Vermillion. I am ready to admit, however, that the source of this\r\n  information is of very doubtful authority; never did a work appear\r\n  which so little merited the attention it received; even the title,\r\n  which seemed to have some claim to originality, was borrowed from a\r\n  work by Mouchart, called “Mors in Olla.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 535:\r\n\r\n  ANODYNE NECKLACES. The roots of Hyoscyamus are commonly strung in the\r\n  form of beads, and sold under this name, to tie round the necks of\r\n  children, to facilitate the growth of their teeth, and allay the\r\n  irritation of teething. The application of medicated necklaces is a\r\n  very ancient superstition. See page 13. Such remedies were sometimes\r\n  called Periapts, περιαπτον.\r\n\r\nFootnote 536:\r\n\r\n  In many cases it is essential that the water should be at the boiling\r\n  point, a few degrees even less than this will often prove a source of\r\n  failure; this is well exemplified by the familiar fact of the weakness\r\n  of our Tea, when made by water that does not quite boil. The Monks of\r\n  St. Bernard, in the Alps, complain that they cannot make good\r\n  Bouillie; the case is simply this, that from the altitude of their\r\n  monastery, the water boils before it can arrive at a sufficiently high\r\n  temperature. Whence we may deduce this important inference, that the\r\n  solvent powers of water are affected by a very slight range of\r\n  temperature. See a fuller account of this subject in my work on\r\n  “Medical Chemistry.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 537:\r\n\r\n  Where the vegetable matter contains much starch, if the water be of a\r\n  temperature higher than 165°, instead of dissolving, it will coagulate\r\n  the starch, and produce a very untractable mass. This fact is well\r\n  known to Brewers, who are extremely cautious in avoiding a too high\r\n  temperature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 538:\r\n\r\n  MADDEN’S VEGETABLE ESSENCE.

According to Linnæus, it is\r\n  not unfrequently obtained from the Psycotria Emetica. The word\r\n  Ipecacuanha signifies _any_ emetic substance.\r\n\r\nFootnote 543:\r\n\r\n  A formula for its preparation is introduced into the new CODEX of\r\n  Paris, being the one used by M. Pelletier; it is as follows. Let ℥i of\r\n  the powder of Ipecacuan be macerated in ℥ij of æther with a gentle\r\n  heat for some hours, in a distilling apparatus; let the portion which\r\n  remains be triturated and boiled with ℥iv of alcohol; it having been\r\n  previously macerated in it; filter and let the remainder be treated\r\n  with fresh portions of alcohol, as long as any thing is taken up from\r\n  the root; mix these alcoholic solutions and evaporate to dryness; let\r\n  this alcoholic extract be macerated in cold distilled water, in order\r\n  that every thing soluble in that menstruum may be dissolved; filter,\r\n  and evaporate to dryness; this extract is _Emetine_. In this state\r\n  however it contains a small quantity of gallic acid, but which is too\r\n  inconsiderable to affect its medicinal qualities.\r\n\r\nFootnote 544:\r\n\r\n  We agree with the author in his estimate of the value of _Emetine_. As\r\n  a general remedy, it possesses no advantage over the Ipecacuanha\r\n  itself, and will probably never supersede it. Cases may occur,\r\n  however, in which its use will be desirable, and it may then be given\r\n  in the following doses. As an Emetic, from four to five grains\r\n  dissolved in a couple of ounces of some aromatic water; as a\r\n  Diaphoretic, about half a grain repeated every four hours; and as an\r\n  Expectorant, one-fifth or one-fourth of a grain repeated every two or\r\n  three hours. These doses apply only to the impure or coloured Emetine,\r\n  the form in which it is commonly found. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 545:\r\n\r\n  IPECACUANHA LOZENGES.

Mr. Phillips has lately taken\r\n  up the subject, and confirmed the statement of Mr. Dalton.\r\n\r\n        thus 10.000 gr. of water, at 212°, dissolve  7.8 of lime\r\n             10.000 gr. of water, at  32°,   ————   15.2  ————\r\n\r\n  Mr. Phillips attempts to account for this apparent anomaly “from the\r\n  effect which heat sometimes produces of increasing instead of\r\n  diminishing the attraction of cohesion. In the present case, he\r\n  continues, the affinities which are brought into play are, the\r\n  attractions of aggregation of the particles of the lime upon each\r\n  other, the attraction of the lime to form a hydrate with a small\r\n  portion of the water, and the mutual affinity existing between that\r\n  hydrate and the water of solution.” And at the high temperature he\r\n  thinks that the former affinities may be so heightened as to overpower\r\n  the latter.\r\n\r\nFootnote 554:\r\n\r\n  Upon this fact Dr. Alton founded his ingenious process for preserving\r\n  water from putrefaction; in the first place he impregnated the water\r\n  with lime, which from its antiseptic property answered the purpose of\r\n  keeping it most completely, and then, in order to get rid of the lime,\r\n  he merely added the carbonate of magnesia, which by transferring its\r\n  carbonic acid, rendered the lime insoluble, and consequently the water\r\n  tasteless and fit for economical purposes. Mr. Henry, however,\r\n  proposed the introduction of a current of carbonic acid into the cask,\r\n  and this expedient has been found equally effective, and far more\r\n  economical.\r\n\r\nFootnote 555:\r\n\r\n  MRS. STEPHEN’S REMEDY FOR THE STONE consisted of lime, which was\r\n  produced by calcining the shells of eggs and snails, and made into\r\n  pills with Soap. A decoction was also administered, consisting of\r\n  Chamomile, Fennel, Parsley and Burdock, together with a portion of\r\n  Alicant Soap. This is a very rational practice, and is very much what\r\n  the practitioners of the present day depend upon: the observations of\r\n  Mrs. Stephens respecting their administration, are equally judicious.\r\n  “If,” says she, “these medicines produce pain, it will be necessary to\r\n  give an opiate with them, and it must be at all times a principal care\r\n  to prevent a looseness, for if this should happen it would carry off\r\n  the medicines; under such circumstances the quantity of the Decoction,\r\n  since it is laxative, must be diminished, and other suitable means\r\n  must be taken by the advice of a Physician.” The credit of introducing\r\n  alkaline medicines for the cure of calculous disorders, does not\r\n  however rest with MRS. STEPHENS. It has been before stated in this\r\n  work, that Basil Valentine employed a fixed alkaline salt in such\r\n  cases; and I may here add, that SENNERTUS, in his Praxis Medica,\r\n  mentions a lithonthryptic that was in great esteem and general use in\r\n  his time, which consisted of one ounce of Salt of Tartar dissolved in\r\n  a pint of parsley water, and afterwards tinged yellow with orange\r\n  peel.\r\n\r\nFootnote 556:\r\n\r\n  VIRGIN’S MILK.

It consists in boiling Nux Vomica in water, and\r\n  evaporating the decoction until it acquires the consistence of Syrup;\r\n  lime is then added, which unites with the acid, and liberates the\r\n  Strychnia; which may then be separated by means of alcohol, from which\r\n  it may be obtained by crystallization.\r\n\r\nFootnote 570:\r\n\r\n  Ann: de Chimie et de Phys. x. 153.\r\n\r\nFootnote 571:\r\n\r\n  M. Majendie has killed a dog with one eighth of a grain, and the\r\n  editor of the Edinburgh Med: & Surg: journ: has seen one die in two\r\n  minutes after the injection of one sixth of a grain into the cavity of\r\n  the pleura. The celebrated Java poison owes its activity to Strychnia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 572:\r\n\r\n  Strychnia was obtained from the beans of St. Ignatius by the following\r\n  process: a portion of the beans being grated was heated in a close\r\n  vessel, under pressure, with sulphuric æther, by which an oily matter\r\n  was dissolved; the residuum then yielded by the action of alcohol, a\r\n  yellowish brown, very bitter substance, which being boiled in pure\r\n  magnesia and filtered, the colouring matter was washed out, and the\r\n  Strychnia and magnesia, in a state of mixture, remained on the filtre.\r\n  The Strychnia was then separated by alcohol, and thus obtained in a\r\n  state of great purity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 573:\r\n\r\n  See note under the article Opium.\r\n\r\nFootnote 574:\r\n\r\n  With regard to the use of Strychnia in paralysis, experiments\r\n  sufficiently numerous have now been made to enable us to judge of its\r\n  true value and efficacy. Like all other remedies it is by no means\r\n  infallible. In some cases it does no good, while in others it causes\r\n  effects which no other remedy is capable of producing. Every thing\r\n  depends upon the nature of the case. Whenever paralysis is the result\r\n  of some organic derangement of the brain, such as tumors pressing upon\r\n  the substance of that organ, diseased alterations in its structure, or\r\n  extravasations of fluid which cannot be absorbed, then this remedy\r\n  will be of no avail. On the other hand, where the paralysis depends\r\n  upon _simple diminished nervous excitement_, it may and has been\r\n  completely cured by the use of this article. In paraplegia it has\r\n  generally been found more successful than in hemiplegia. The first\r\n  effects of the remedy in all cases are convulsive twitchings of the\r\n  paralyzed parts, and no benefit is derived from its use until this\r\n  effect is produced and continued for some time. If plethora should be\r\n  present, this is to be corrected by venesection, purgatives, and other\r\n  appropriate treatment. It is a great advantage attending the use of\r\n  this powerful agent that it does not at all impair the tone of the\r\n  stomach; on the contrary, it has a tendency to increase the appetite\r\n  and promote digestion. In having recourse to the Strychnia, the best\r\n  way is to commence with small doses, increasing them gradually\r\n  according to the effect produced—one-eighth of a grain twice a day is\r\n  sufficient to begin with. This may be cautiously increased to 1/6,\r\n  1/4, or even ½ a grain twice a day. Should any unpleasant symptoms\r\n  occur, of course its use should be discontinued; and when the symptoms\r\n  subside, it may again be resumed. By observing these general\r\n  precautions there is no danger in using this otherwise potent agent.\r\n  The best form of giving it is in that of pill, made up with conserve\r\n  of roses.\r\n\r\n  From experiments made with _Brucia_, it is found to exert an influence\r\n  analogous to that of the _Strychnia_, only less energetic—one-fourth\r\n  of a grain of the latter equals in effect about six grains of the\r\n  former. It occasions violent tetanic attacks, and acts upon the nerves\r\n  without affecting the brain or the intellectual functions. From the\r\n  inferior energy of the Brucia, it may be used in cases where the\r\n  Strychnia would not be proper. The dose to begin with is gr. j. twice\r\n  a day, increased to three or four times a day. Unless it does some\r\n  good in five or six weeks its use should be discontinued.—ED.\r\n\r\nFootnote 575:\r\n\r\n  HUILES ANTIQUES. The basis of the best of these oils, is the oil of\r\n  Ben, from the nuts of the Guilangia Moringa, or oil of hazel, which is\r\n  a very good substitute, since it is inodorous, colourless, and may be\r\n  kept for a considerable period without becoming rancid: it is\r\n  therefore well adapted to receive and retain the odour of those\r\n  vegetables that yield but a small proportion of essential oil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 576:\r\n\r\n  OIL OF BRICKS.

See Abietis Resina.\r\n\r\nFootnote 583:\r\n\r\n  The Greeks and Romans attached a very different meaning to the terms\r\n  OPIUM and MECONIUM.

Derosne first obtained a crystalline\r\n  substance from Opium in the year 1803, which dissolved in acids; but\r\n  he did not determine its nature or properties.\r\n\r\nFootnote 585:\r\n\r\n  In 1804 Seguin (Ann. de Chim. vol. 92) discovered another crystalline\r\n  body in opium, and although he described most of its properties he\r\n  never hinted at its alkaline nature.\r\n\r\nFootnote 586:\r\n\r\n  Sertuerner at Eimbeck, in Hanover, had at the same time as Derosne and\r\n  Seguin, obtained these crystalline bodies, (Ann. de Chim. et de Phy.\r\n  T. v.) but it was not until the year 1817, that he first unequivocally\r\n  proclaimed the existence of a vegetable alkali, and assigned to it the\r\n  narcotic powers which distinguish the operation of opium; to this body\r\n  he gave the name of Morphia, and it appears to be the same as the\r\n  essential salt noticed by Seguin. The salt of Derosne, now more\r\n  usually denominated Narcotine, is quite a different principle,\r\n  although it was constantly mistaken for one of the salts of Morphia,\r\n  till M. Robiquet (Ann. de Chim. & de Phy. T. v.) pointed out its\r\n  distinctive properties. It is an azotized substance, crystallizing in\r\n  beautiful pearly prisms or tables; soluble in fixed oil, and still\r\n  more so in æther and the acids; insoluble in water, and little soluble\r\n  in alcohol; destitute of action on the vegetable colours, and\r\n  incapable of neutralizing acids. There still exists, however, very\r\n  considerable confusion with respect to this salt, and farther\r\n  experiments are required to ascertain its chemical nature, as well as\r\n  its physiological action.\r\n\r\nFootnote 587:\r\n\r\n  The discovery of an alkaline body in opium induced the French and\r\n  German chemists to examine the composition of other active\r\n  vegetables, with a view to detect the existence of an analogous\r\n  principle; and their labours have been rewarded with unexampled\r\n  success. They have accordingly obtained STRYCHNIA from the nut of\r\n  the Strychnos nux vomica;—BRUCIA from the bark of the Brucea\r\n  Anti-dysenterica (False Angustura Bark) VERATRIA from the Veratrum\r\n  album, V. Sabadilla and Colchicum Autumnale;—CINCHONIA from the bark\r\n  of the Cinchona Oblongifolia (Red Bark);—QUINA (or Kina) from that\r\n  of the Cinchona Cordifolia (Yellow Bark);—EMETA from the Callicocca\r\n  Ipecacuanha;—DELPHIA, from the Delphinium Staphisagria;—PICROTOXA\r\n  from the Menispermum Cocculus;—SOLANA from the Solanum Nigrum, and\r\n  S. Dulcamara; GENTIA, from Gentiana lutea;—ATROPIA from the Atropa\r\n  Belladonna;—HYOSCYAMA, from Hyoscyamus Niger. Besides which,\r\n  Capsicum, Piper nigrum, and SENNA, have been said to yield analogous\r\n  principles of a salifiable character. With respect to most of these\r\n  alkaline bodies farther experiments are required to establish our\r\n  confidence; it is more than probable that several of them will turn\r\n  out to be disguised modifications of each other; it has already been\r\n  questioned whether QUINA and CINCHONIA be not varieties of one\r\n  alkali; indeed it is possible that all these bodies may have the\r\n  same alkaline base, and that they differ from each other in\r\n  consequence of their combination with other principles, derived from\r\n  the vegetable in question, and impressing upon the salt its\r\n  characteristic virtues; and this idea receives material support from\r\n  the fact, that they are neutralized by a very small proportion of\r\n  acid. (See a paper on this subject in the 70th number of the\r\n  Edinburgh Med. and Surg. Journ.)\r\n\r\n  They have all many properties in common, such as a degree of\r\n  bitterness varying in intensity in different species; they are\r\n  inodorous; are not altered by air or light, but are decomposed by a\r\n  moderate heat; most of them enter into fusion, but at different\r\n  temperatures, some for instance at below 212° Fahr. others not until\r\n  they are about to be decomposed; HYOSCYAMA will even resist a low red\r\n  heat. They are very sparingly soluble in water, but they are in\r\n  general rendered more so by the presence of resinous matter. They are\r\n  nearly all highly soluble in alcohol. Æther readily dissolves DELPHIA,\r\n  VERATRIA, EMETA, QUINA, and GENTIA; but MORPHIA, CINCHONIA, and\r\n  PICROTOXA, are very sparingly soluble: and STRYCHNIA and BRUCIA are\r\n  nearly insoluble in it; they combine with the acids; and, in general,\r\n  form neutral salts; but it appears that VERATRIA and EMETA always\r\n  unite with an excess of acid. All the combinations with the mineral\r\n  acids, excepting the salts of PICROTOXA, are exceedingly soluble in\r\n  water; and, with the exception of NITRATE OF CINCHONIA, and all the\r\n  salts of VERATRIA, they are crystallizable. The acetates too, with a\r\n  few exceptions, are also soluble, and they are disposed to form\r\n  super-salts. All the oxalates, except that of PICRATOXA, which is the\r\n  most soluble of its salts, and all tartrates, are rather insoluble,\r\n  and have likewise a tendency to unite with an excess of acid. The\r\n  action of concentrated nitric acid on these alkaline bodies is very\r\n  peculiar, converting the greater number of them into artificial\r\n  tannin; but it appears to peroxidate MORPHIA, STRYCHNIA, and BRUCIA,\r\n  rendering them less powerful as salifiable bases, and diminishing or\r\n  destroying their action on the animal body. See Edinburgh Med. & Surg.\r\n  Journ. supra citat.\r\n\r\n  By analysis, with the deutoxide of copper, these alkalies yield\r\n  carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen; but no azote, unless they have been\r\n  obtained by precipitation with ammonia, as in the process of\r\n  Sertuerner.\r\n\r\n  It would appear that these bodies exist in their native plants, in\r\n  combination with peculiar acids; some of them are found in the state\r\n  of Malates.\r\n\r\n  With respect to their physiological action it may be stated, that they\r\n  would appear to concentrate in themselves the characteristic\r\n  properties of the vegetables to which they belong, and yet, although\r\n  their effects are much greater than those of the undecomposed\r\n  vegetables, the same quantity of alkali is not so powerful in its pure\r\n  form, as in its natural state of combination. Thus one grain of\r\n  morphia produces no more effect than two grains of Turkey opium, which\r\n  do not contain more than a sixteenth part of the alkali. To explain\r\n  this loss of efficacy which usually attends our attempts at\r\n  concentration, the reader is referred to the observations which have\r\n  been already offered upon this subject in the first part of this work,\r\n  page 153.\r\n\r\nFootnote 588:\r\n\r\n  The manufacture, however, of Indian Opium has been of late years\r\n  greatly improved by Dr. Fleming, under whose superintendance that\r\n  important department was placed by the Marquis Wellesley.\r\n\r\nFootnote 589:\r\n\r\n  Forty thousand pounds weight of Opium are annually imported into the\r\n  Port of London.\r\n\r\nFootnote 590:\r\n\r\n  It has been stated in the Historical Introduction to this work, (page\r\n  8) that the nepenthe, which Helen mixed with wine, and gave to the\r\n  guests of Menelaus, was probably opium; such was the opinion of\r\n  Sprengel, expressed in his History of Botany. Other authors have\r\n  entertained a different belief. Delile, in his “Flora Egyptiaca,”\r\n  considers it to have been a preparation of hyoscyamus albus. Dr.\r\n  Christen, in his late elaborate Dissertation on Opium, agrees with\r\n  Forbes, who states, in his Oriental Memoirs, that in Hindostan\r\n  Bendsch, i. e. nepenthe is prepared from the cannabis sativa of\r\n  Linnæus. Linder informs us that bangue is prepared from the dried\r\n  leaves of the wild cannabis, the smoke of which is said to be more\r\n  narcotic than even that of opium. There seems, however, to be good\r\n  reason for supposing that Indian bangue is a compound of several\r\n  ingredients. Ray says that he learned from Sir Hans Sloane, that the\r\n  principal ingredient was not hemp, but a plant somewhat like it.\r\n\r\nFootnote 591:\r\n\r\n  The operation of Opium is not unfrequently attended with an itching,\r\n  or sense of pricking of the skin, which is sometimes terminated by a\r\n  species of miliary eruption.\r\n\r\nFootnote 592:\r\n\r\n  Opium is the Quack’s sheet anchor. The various nostrums advertised as\r\n  “Cough Drops, for the cure of colds, asthmas, catarrhs, &c.” are\r\n  preparations of Opium very similar to paregoric elixir. PECTORAL\r\n  BALSAM OF LIQUORICE, and ESSENCE OF COLTSFOOT, are combinations of\r\n  this kind. GRINDLE’S COUGH DROPS, are a preparation of the same\r\n  description, only made with Rectified, instead of Proof Spirit, and\r\n  consequently more highly charged with stimulant materials. “The\r\n  mischief,” says Dr. Fothergill, “that has proceeded from the healing\r\n  anodynes of quacks can be scarcely imagined; for in coughs, arising\r\n  from suppressed perspiration or an inflammatory diathesis, Opiates\r\n  generally do harm.”\r\n\r\n  SQUIRE’S ELIXIR.

This nostrum may very properly be classed\r\n  under the present head. It consists of an aqueous infusion of\r\n  horehound and liquorice root, with double the proportion of proof\r\n  spirit or brandy; to which is then added, opium, camphor, benzoin,\r\n  squills, oil of aniseed, and honey.\r\n\r\nFootnote 593:\r\n\r\n  LIQUOR MORPHII CITRATIS. ℞.Opii Crudi Optimi ℥iv; Acidi Citrici\r\n  (Cryst:) ℥ij; semel in mortario lapideo contunde, dein aquæ distillatæ\r\n  bullientis oj affunde; et intime misceantur; macera per horas viginti\r\n  quatuor; per chartam bibulosam cola.\r\n\r\nFootnote 594:\r\n\r\n  THE BLACK DROP, or The Lancaster, or Quaker’s Black Drop. This\r\n  preparation, which has been long known and esteemed, as being more\r\n  powerful in its operation and less distressing in its effects than any\r\n  tincture of opium, has until lately been involved in much obscurity;\r\n  the papers however of the late Edward Walton, of Sunderland, one of\r\n  the near relations of the original proprietor, having fallen into the\r\n  hands of Dr. Armstrong, that gentleman has obliged the profession by\r\n  publishing the manner in which it is prepared, and is as\r\n  follows:—“Take half a pound of opium sliced; three pints of good\r\n  verjuice (juice of the wild crab,) and one and a half ounce of\r\n  nutmegs, and half an ounce of saffron. Boil them to a proper\r\n  thickness, then add a quarter of a pound of sugar, and two spoonsful\r\n  of yeast. Set the whole in a warm place near the fire, for six or\r\n  eight weeks, then place it in the open air until it becomes a syrup;\r\n  lastly, decant, filter, and bottle it up, adding a little sugar to\r\n  each bottle.” One drop of this preparation is considered equal to\r\n  about three of the Tincture of Opium. P. L. It would appear that an\r\n  Acetate of Morphia is formed, which is more active, and less\r\n  distressing in its effects, than any other narcotic combination.\r\n\r\n  The French Codex contains directions for preparing a compound very\r\n  similar to the Black Drop; viz.\r\n\r\n  VINUM OPIATUM FERMENTATIONE PARATUM, or Guttæ seu Laudanum Abbatis\r\n  Rousseau. Take of white honey twelve ounces; warm water, three pounds;\r\n  dissolve the honey in the water, pour it into a matrass, and set it\r\n  aside in a warm place: as soon as fermentation has commenced, add four\r\n  ounces of good opium, having previously dissolved, or rather diffused\r\n  it in twelve ounces of water; allow them to ferment together for a\r\n  month, then evaporate until ten ounces only remain, filter, and add\r\n  four ounces and a half of alcohol.\r\n\r\n  LIQUOR OPII SEDATIVUS. Under this name, Mr. Battley, a manufacturing\r\n  druggist, of Fore-street, London, has offered for sale a narcotic\r\n  preparation, which it is generally supposed owes its efficacy to the\r\n  acetate of morphia; on being kept, however, I found that it underwent\r\n  some important change, during which so much air was disengaged as to\r\n  blow out the cork from the bottle with violence. This is an objection\r\n  to its admission into practice, unless we can ensure recently prepared\r\n  portions as often as they may be required.\r\n\r\n  In publishing the above statement, I have unfortunately been the cause\r\n  of much unnecessary INK-SHED. A letter, by Mr. Battley, has been\r\n  industriously circulated through the different ranks of the\r\n  profession, purporting to be an apology for his preparation, but after\r\n  a careful perusal of it, instead of being able to discover any\r\n  argument in its favour, we receive a full acknowledgment of the\r\n  validity of the objection above stated. “I explained to Dr. Paris,\r\n  that the liability of the solution to undergo change, WAS A DEFECT in\r\n  the preparation, but that the addition of a little spirit would\r\n  prevent decomposition,” and yet in the next sentence he tells us that\r\n  in those cases in which it is most beneficial, “the addition of spirit\r\n  would be highly improper.” See Medical Repository, vol. xiii, p. 273.\r\n\r\n  But the circumstance which has excited the greatest indignation in the\r\n  mind of Mr. Battley, is my having applied the term NOSTRUM to his\r\n  preparation. Every medicine that is prepared by a secret process, and\r\n  sold for the private advantage of an individual, is properly\r\n  designated a NOSTRUM. And I am at a loss to discover any feature in\r\n  the present case that can entitle it to be considered as an exception\r\n  to this general rule; but perhaps Mr. Battley is inclined to be\r\n  hypercritical, and as the preparation is not indebted to him, but to\r\n  Wedelius or Le Mort, for its origin, is prepared to exclaim with the\r\n  Roman Poet:\r\n\r\n                “Quæ non fecimus ipsi vix ea NOSTRA VOCO.”\r\n\r\n  Mr. Battley also complains bitterly of my having inserted his\r\n  preparation under so odious a motto as “Arcana Revelata fætent,” for\r\n  my own part I cannot conceive any thing more appropriate to the case,\r\n  viz. Arcana, _these secret preparations_, revelata, _exposed to the\r\n  air_, fætent, _grow fœtid_. But, notwithstanding the objections which\r\n  I have thus felt it my duty to offer, I am disposed to speak\r\n  favourably of its mild and uniform effects, and in justice to Mr.\r\n  Battley, I will further state the same opinion has been formed by a\r\n  great number of respectable practitioners. The late Mr. Haden, who\r\n  during his protracted illness took a large quantity of this\r\n  preparation, states, in his Translation of the Formulary of Dr.\r\n  Majendie, that it is devoid of exciting, and almost of constipating,\r\n  properties. He made a very good substitute, “by macerating the dregs,\r\n  remaining after making tincture of opium, in a solution of Tartaric\r\n  acid.” The preparation formed a tolerably deep tincture, and 40 drops\r\n  acted, he thought, in all respects, like 20 of the liquor opii\r\n  sedativus. It neither stimulated, nor produced costiveness.\r\n\r\nFootnote 595:\r\n\r\n  GODBOLD’S VEGETABLE BALSAM. In the specification of the Patent for\r\n  this nostrum forty-two different vegetables are directed to be\r\n  distilled “for the purpose of extracting their essences, which are to\r\n  be preserved separately and apart from each other, in syrups, and are\r\n  to be mixed with the following gums and drugs, viz.

It is, however,\r\n  not a little curious that amongst the forty-two plants enumerated,\r\n  there should be several that would on distillation yield Prussic acid,\r\n  such as the Bays. We wonder that this accidental circumstance has not\r\n  been noticed, and turned to account, by some of those worthy disciples\r\n  of Esculapius who live by the credulity of mankind, and, as Falstaff\r\n  expresses it, “Turn diseases to a commodity.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 596:\r\n\r\n  “It is in this manner, I apprehend, that stimulating syrups will\r\n  frequently remove hoarseness.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 597:\r\n\r\n  Although it has been long known that the seeds of the poppy, and the\r\n  oil obtained from them by expression, do not possess any of the\r\n  narcotic properties of the plant, and that they were even baked into\r\n  cakes and used as an article of food by the ancients, yet has there\r\n  been in later times very considerable contention respecting the\r\n  propriety and safety of using such oil. The cultivation of the Poppy\r\n  for the sake of the oil of its seeds, as an article of food, has been\r\n  long carried on in France, Brabant, and Germany; and more recently in\r\n  Holland. At about the beginning of the 17th century, the opposition to\r\n  this use of the Poppy manifested itself in France, and became so\r\n  violent, that the Lieutenant General of the Police of Paris ordered\r\n  the medical faculty of that city to make the strictest examination\r\n  concerning this point, and they accordingly reported that, as there is\r\n  nothing narcotic or prejudicial to health in the oil, the use of it\r\n  might be permitted. But this decision was unsatisfactory; and popular\r\n  clamour determined the Court to pass a decree in 1718, prohibiting the\r\n  sale of Poppy Oil, whether mixed or unmixed! The sale of the article,\r\n  however, notwithstanding this most singular decree, was clandestinely\r\n  encouraged, and it gradually increased until the year 1735, when the\r\n  Court issued a severe decree, enjoining the superintendent to mix a\r\n  certain quantity of the extract of Turpentine, with every cask\r\n  containing 1100 lbs. of this oil, of which no less than 2000 casks\r\n  were consumed in Paris alone. But the secret demand for it increased\r\n  until 1773, when a Society of Agriculture undertook to examine the\r\n  question, and the result of their labours had the effect of reversing\r\n  the prohibition, and of convincing the multitude that their fears were\r\n  entirely unfounded, and that there was really no narcotic power, nor\r\n  any secret mischief in the article.\r\n\r\nFootnote 598:\r\n\r\n  As these pills are liable to become hard and insoluble by being kept,\r\n  it is better to keep the ingredients in powder, and to form them\r\n  extemporaneously with a little syrup.\r\n\r\nFootnote 599:\r\n\r\n  The Pix Arida of the late Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 600:\r\n\r\n  Tar water was also at one period celebrated as an antisiphylitic\r\n  remedy.

Of this a tea spoonful\r\n  is to be taken every hour or half hour as circumstances may require.\r\n  When used as an emmenagogue, the decoction is to be prepared by\r\n  simmering in a close vessel ℥j of the bruised root in a pint of\r\n  boiling water, until it is reduced about one third—of this four ounces\r\n  are to be taken daily, and to be increased as far as the stomach will\r\n  bear, at the menstrual period. _Ed._\r\n\r\nFootnote 634:\r\n\r\n  It enters into the composition of Stoughton’s Elixir, for which see\r\n  Gentianæ Radix.\r\n\r\nFootnote 635:\r\n\r\n  It is for this reason that the cake left after expression is so much\r\n  more pungent than the seeds, for the fixed oil can be easily separated\r\n  by pressure.\r\n\r\nFootnote 636:\r\n\r\n  WHITEHEAD’S ESSENCE OF MUSTARD.—This consists of oil of turpentine,\r\n  camphor, and a portion of spirit of rosemary; to which is added a\r\n  small quantity of flour of mustard.\r\n\r\n  WHITEHEAD’S ESSENCE OF MUSTARD PILLS.—Balsam of Tolu, with resin!\r\n\r\n  READY MADE MUSTARD.—This is made up with currant wine, and sugar;\r\n  formerly Must, or grape juice, was employed for this purpose, whence\r\n  the name _Mustard_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 637:\r\n\r\n  This term is also applied to the Sub-carbonate of Ammonia. The\r\n  objection to its use depends upon the solecism which it involves; the\r\n  division of an atom, which, according to chemical principles, is\r\n  indivisible; but this objection may be answered by stating, that the\r\n  term is one merely of convenience, and serves to express the\r\n  proportions of the acid and its base. The chemical difficulty is at\r\n  once solved by multiplying each by two, which will make the\r\n  proportions as 3 to 2. instead of 1½ to 1.\r\n\r\nFootnote 638:\r\n\r\n  SODAIC POWDERS.—Contained in two distinct papers, one of which is\r\n  blue, the other white; that in the former consists of ʒss of the\r\n  carbonate of soda, that in the latter of grs. xxv of tartaric acid.\r\n  These powders require half a pint of water. It is very evident that a\r\n  solution of these powders is by no means similar to “Soda Water,”\r\n  which it is intended to emulate; for in this latter preparation, the\r\n  soda is in combination only with carbonic acid; whereas the solution\r\n  of the “Sodaic Powders” is that of a neutral salt, with a portion of\r\n  fixed air diffused through it.\r\n\r\n  PATENT SEIDLITZ POWDERS.—These consist of two different powders; the\r\n  one, contained in a white paper, consists of ʒij of Tartarized Soda,\r\n  and ℈ij of Carbonate of Soda; that in the blue paper, of grs. xxxv of\r\n  tartaric acid. The contents of the white paper are to be dissolved in\r\n  half a pint of spring water, to which those of the blue paper are to\r\n  be added; the draught is to be taken in a state of effervescence. The\r\n  acid being in excess renders it more grateful, and no less efficacious\r\n  as a purgative. This preparation cannot be said to bear any other\r\n  resemblance to the mineral water of Seidlitz, than in being purgative.\r\n  The water of this spring, which was discovered by Hoffman about a\r\n  century ago, contains Sulphate of Magnesia as its active ingredient,\r\n  together with Muriate of Magnesia, and Sulphate, and Carbonate of\r\n  Lime. In the Codex Medicamentarius of Paris there are two formulæ for\r\n  the preparation of a water which may resemble that of Seidlitz, the\r\n  one differing from the other merely in the proportion of its Sulphate\r\n  of Magnesia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 639:\r\n\r\n  Our English Salt is generally thus contaminated; for which reason it\r\n  is unfit for the curing of several kinds of fish; this will not appear\r\n  strange, says Mr. Parkes, when it is considered that merely its own\r\n  weight of water is all that is necessary for the complete solution of\r\n  muriate of magnesia; a circumstance which renders it impossible to\r\n  preserve such salt for any length of time in a dry state. This muriate\r\n  however might be separated from common salt, on a large scale, for one\r\n  shilling per cwt. By exposing the salt to a gentle heat in\r\n  reverberatory furnaces, the muriatic acid of the magnesian muriate\r\n  will fly off, and the magnesia (on a subsequent solution of the salt)\r\n  will be precipitated. It is well known that muriate of magnesia begins\r\n  to part with its acid at a temperature a little higher than that of\r\n  boiling water.\r\n\r\nFootnote 640:\r\n\r\n  The annual quantity of salt raised from the Salt Mines and Springs in\r\n  Europe, is estimated at from 25 to 30 millions of cwt.\r\n\r\nFootnote 641:\r\n\r\n  The respect paid to Salt amongst Eastern nations is very remarkable,\r\n  and may be traced to the highest antiquity. Homer gives to it the\r\n  epithet of θεὶον, Il. ix. p. 214.\r\n\r\nFootnote 642:\r\n\r\n  In addition to the numerous instances cited by these authors, I may\r\n  here introduce one which has been just communicated to me by my friend\r\n  Mr. John Taylor, the agent of the London Company for working the Real\r\n  del Monte Silver Mines in Mexico. He states that the ore, which\r\n  consists of the Sulphuret of Silver, is, together with Mercury,\r\n  amassed in heaps with iron pyrites and common salt; and that such is\r\n  the greediness of the Mules employed in the works for the Salt, that\r\n  they are constantly licking the materials; the consequence is that a\r\n  portion of the Silver Amalgam is introduced into their stomachs; the\r\n  animals, however, suffer no inconvenience; but, after death, on\r\n  opening their stomachs, it is not unusual to find considerable masses\r\n  of Silver, the mercury having escaped, or been dissolved by the\r\n  gastric juice.\r\n\r\nFootnote 643:\r\n\r\n  The celebrated Indian Tonic for Dyspepsia and Gout, called Bit laban,\r\n  is prepared by fusing together muriate of soda and some other\r\n  ingredients. See Dr. Fleming’s Catalogue of Indian Medicinal plants\r\n  and drugs, p. 54, 55.\r\n\r\nFootnote 644:\r\n\r\n  I have myself witnessed the bad effects of a diet of unsalted fish;\r\n  and in my examination before a Committee of the House of Commons in\r\n  1818, appointed “for the purpose of inquiring into the laws respecting\r\n  the Salt Duties,” I stated the great injury which the poorer classes\r\n  in many districts sustained in their health, from an inability to\r\n  procure this essential article. Lord Somerville (in his address to the\r\n  Board of Agriculture) gave an interesting account of the effects of a\r\n  punishment which formerly existed in Holland. “The ancient laws of the\r\n  country ordained men to be kept on bread alone, UNMIXED WITH SALT, as\r\n  the SEVEREST punishment that could be inflicted upon them in their\r\n  moist climate; the effect was horrible: these wretched criminals are\r\n  said to have been DEVOURED BY WORMS, engendered in their own\r\n  stomachs.”\r\n\r\n  SALT was an object of taxation at a very early period in this country;\r\n  Ancus Martius, 640 years before our era ‘_Salinarum Vectigal_\r\n  instituit.’ This tribute was continued on the Britons when our Isle\r\n  was possessed by the Romans, who worked the Droitwich Mines, and who\r\n  made salt part of their soldiers _Salarium_, or salary. Hence the\r\n  custom at the Eton Montem of asking for salt.\r\n\r\n  The great advantages which must ultimately accrue to this nation in\r\n  its fisheries, agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, from a late\r\n  remission of the odious and impolitic tax upon salt, are incalculable.\r\n  The government of France appears to have been as impolitic with regard\r\n  to this tax as the English. Buonaparte abolished the collection of\r\n  turnpike dues; and imposed a tax on salt, payable at the Salt-pans, in\r\n  its stead. It is not perhaps generally known, that by the aid of this\r\n  tax he was enabled to complete the grand entrance into Italy, over the\r\n  Simplon; so that it may be fairly observed, that if HANNIBAL was\r\n  enabled to cross the Alps by the aid of VINEGAR—BUONAPARTE, by the\r\n  assistance of SALT, succeeded in constructing a public road over the\r\n  same mountains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 645:\r\n\r\n  CHELTENHAM SALTS.—A factitious compound has been long vended, as a\r\n  popular purgative, under this name; it is formed by triturating\r\n  together the following salts. Sulphate of Soda, grs. 120. Sulphate of\r\n  Magnesia, grs. 66. Muriate of Soda, 10. Sulphate of Iron, gr. ½. As a\r\n  purgative it is very efficacious, and superior probably to that which\r\n  is actually obtained by the evaporation of the Cheltenham water\r\n  itself; for notwithstanding the high pretensions with which this\r\n  latter salt has been publicly announced, it will be found to be little\r\n  else than common Glauber’s Salt. This fact has been confirmed by the\r\n  experiments of Mr. Richard Phillips, (Annals of Philosophy, No. lxi,)\r\n  who observes, that the “REAL CHELTENHAM SALTS contain no chalybeate\r\n  property, but are merely sulphate of soda, mixed with a minute\r\n  quantity of soda, and a very small portion of common salt.” It could\r\n  not be imagined that the salt should contain oxide of iron even in a\r\n  state of mixture, much less in combination, for carbonate of iron is\r\n  readily decomposed by ebullition, and the oxide of iron is\r\n  precipitated before the salt can be crystallized. A preparation, under\r\n  the name of Thomson’s Cheltenham Salts, is accordingly manufactured in\r\n  London, by evaporating a solution consisting of sulphate of soda and\r\n  sub-carbonate of soda.\r\n\r\n  “EFFLORESCENCE OF REAL CHELTENHAM SALTS.” The preceding salt deprived\r\n  of its water of crystallization.\r\n\r\n  “EFFLORESCENCE OF REAL MAGNESIAN CHELTENHAM SALTS,” MADE FROM THE\r\n  WATERS OF THE CHALYBEATE MAGNESIAN SPA. This is asserted to be a\r\n  sub-sulphate from nature, which combines both a pure and a\r\n  sub-sulphated magnesia in its composition; “but,” says Mr. Phillips,\r\n  “neither nature nor art has ever produced such a combination; in\r\n  truth, it consists of Epsom Salt, with small portions of magnesia, and\r\n  muriate of magnesia or muriate of soda.”\r\n\r\n  MURIO-SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA AND IRON. The preparation thus named by Mr.\r\n  Thomson, was found by Mr. Phillips to consist of Epsom Salt, deprived\r\n  of part of its water of crystallization, and discoloured by a little\r\n  rust of iron, and containing a small portion of muriate of magnesia.\r\n\r\n  Thus it appears, that not one of these preparations is similar to the\r\n  water which is drank at the Spa; in order to remedy this difficulty,\r\n  Mr. Thomson prepared the “ORIGINAL COMBINED CHELTENHAM SALTS,” by\r\n  evaporating the waters to dryness: but a very small share of chemical\r\n  penetration is required to satisfy us that no process of this\r\n  description can remedy the defect described, for as Mr. Phillips has\r\n  observed, the chalybeate properties of the water must be essentially\r\n  altered by such an operation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 646:\r\n\r\n  HUNGARY WATER.

This article, when genuine, is a\r\n  pure spirit distilled from the Rosemary, and is strongly scented with\r\n  the rich perfume of that aromatic plant.\r\n\r\nFootnote 647:\r\n\r\n  I apprehend that the peculiar flavour of Cogniac depends upon the\r\n  presence of an æthereal spirit, formed by the action of Tartaric or\r\n  perhaps Acetic acid upon Alcohol; it is on this account that Nitric\r\n  Æther, when added to Malt spirits, gives them the flavour of French\r\n  Brandy. The same flavour is also successfully obtained by distilling\r\n  British spirits over wine lees, or by distilling a spirit obtained\r\n  from Raisin Wine, which has become acescent.\r\n\r\n  In new brandy there also appears to be an uncombined acid, giving to\r\n  it a peculiar taste and quality, which are lost by age. This explains\r\n  the reason why the addition of five or six drops of “liquor ammoniæ,”\r\n  to each bottle of new brandy, will impart to it the qualities of that\r\n  of the oldest date.\r\n\r\nFootnote 648:\r\n\r\n  TAYLOR’S RED BOTTLE, commonly called the Whitworth Doctor.

By a receipt of this kind the celebrated\r\n  Punch of Vauxhall is prepared.\r\n\r\nFootnote 651:\r\n\r\n  The famous Helvetian Styptic, described in page 83, depended wholly on\r\n  this accidental contamination for its colour, and it was no small\r\n  mortification to our chemists, when this nostrum was first introduced\r\n  amongst us, that they could not prepare it with our own spirits, but\r\n  were obliged to be at the expense of true French Brandy. Our own\r\n  Spirits, although equally coloured, would never produce a violet\r\n  tincture; at length, however, the mystery was discovered, and the gall\r\n  nut imparted to the tincture that characteristic colour which was so\r\n  long considered essential to its efficacy; but the discovery threw\r\n  discredit upon the nostrum, and it fell into disuse.\r\n\r\nFootnote 652:\r\n\r\n  If any additional argument were necessary, we might repeat, that\r\n  Arsenic in its metallic state is not poisonous. As it is almost\r\n  impossible to reduce metallic arsenic to a state of powder, without\r\n  its becoming oxidized, M. Renault had recourse to its alloys for\r\n  deciding the question; and he found that Mispickel (an alloy of iron\r\n  and arsenic,) when given to the extent of two drachms, had no apparent\r\n  effect; this result agrees with the conclusion of Bayen in his work on\r\n  Tin, and proves that the arsenic which may be contained in that metal\r\n  cannot produce any medicinal effect, as it exists in its metallic\r\n  state.

See page 132.\r\n\r\nFootnote 659:\r\n\r\n  It seems very probable that the “juice of cursed hebenon,” by which,\r\n  according to Shakespeare, the king of Denmark was poisoned, was no\r\n  other than the essential oil of Tobacco:—\r\n\r\n                ——“Sleeping within mine orchard,\r\n                My custom always of the afternoon,\r\n                Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,\r\n                With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,\r\n                And in the porches of mine ears, did pour\r\n                The leperous distilment.”\r\n\r\n  In the first place, the learned commentator Dr. Grey, observes that\r\n  the word here used (hebenon), was more probably designated by a\r\n  metathesis, either of the poet or transcriber, for henebon, i. e.\r\n  henbane. Now it appears from Gerarde, that “tabaco” was commonly\r\n  called henbane of Peru, (hyoscyamus Peruvianus,) and when we consider\r\n  how high the public prejudice ran against this herb in the reign of\r\n  James, it seems very likely that Shakespeare should have selected it,\r\n  as an agent of extraordinary malignity. No preparation of the\r\n  hyoscyamus, with which we are acquainted, would produce death by\r\n  application to the ear, whereas the essential oil of Tobacco would,\r\n  without doubt, occasion a fatal issue. The term distilment has also\r\n  called forth a remark from Steevens, which is calculated to support\r\n  this conjecture; surely, says he, this expression signifies, that the\r\n  preparation was the result of a distillation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 660:\r\n\r\n  See “An Essay on the means of lessening Pain, and facilitating certain\r\n  Cases of difficult parturition, by W.

According to the experiments of\r\n  M.

From the experiments of M. Planche, it moreover appears\r\n  that there is a series of vegetable roots which, when fresh, are\r\n  capable of producing a blue colour, if introduced into an alcoholic\r\n  solution of Guaiacum: so that we may hereafter be furnished with a\r\n  chemical test that will at once appreciate their freshness, which is\r\n  undoubtedly one of the greatest desiderata of pharmaceutical science.\r\n\r\n  A communication has appeared from Mr. A.

For this purpose I have found it\r\n  advantageous to give it in a little tepid water: upon chemical\r\n  examination I could not discover that it ever passed off by the urine;\r\n  the fæces, however, are uniformly coloured black by it, whence I\r\n  conclude it must be evacuated through the bowels. In order to prevent\r\n  its tendency to constipate the bowels, I have found it necessary to\r\n  give some aperient, as castor oil, speedily after its exhibition.” May\r\n  not this latter circumstance explain the reason of his not having\r\n  detected it in the urine?

One of the two Sweating Powders of WARD was a\r\n  combination of the Veratrum and Opium, it is certainly a very singular\r\n  coincidence, that recent experiments should have shewn that the active\r\n  principle of colchicum is identical with that which gives efficacy to\r\n  the hellebore, viz.

As iron might be accidentally\r\n  contained in the wine, the muriatic acid is added to prevent its\r\n  precipitation.\r\n\r\nFootnote 708:\r\n\r\n  Lead will not only correct the acidity of wines, but remove the\r\n  rancidity of oils: a property which is well known to Painters, and\r\n  which affords an expedient for making an inferior oil pass for a good\r\n  one.\r\n\r\nFootnote 709:\r\n\r\n  The quantity of rectified spirit and water ordered will be found on\r\n  admixture to produce a spirit nearly of the above strength.\r\n\r\nFootnote 710:\r\n\r\n  WARD’S RED DROP. A strong vinous solution of Tartarized Antimony.\r\n\r\nFootnote 711:\r\n\r\n  FORD’S LAUDANUM. This is similar to the Vinum Opii of the present\r\n  Pharmacopœia.\r\n\r\nFootnote 712:\r\n\r\n  Laudanum. Paracelsus first bestowed the term Laudanum upon a\r\n  preparation of Opium, a LAUDATA ejus efficacia, LAUDATUM medicamentum.\r\n\r\nFootnote 713:\r\n\r\n  According to the experiments of M. Vogel, Annales de Chimie, (t. lxiv.\r\n  p. 220) this ointment is nothing more than metallic mercury mixed with\r\n  grease, the division of which has been carried to such an extent as to\r\n  impart a blackish colour to the mixture.\r\n\r\nFootnote 714:\r\n\r\n  It is to be hoped that a quantity of the ointment will be prepared\r\n  according to these views, and be submitted to a more extended series\r\n  of experiments. The oxide may be procured by decomposing Calomel by a\r\n  solution of pure potass, or by pouring a solution of the nitrate of\r\n  mercury into a caustic alkaline solution; this oxide should be at\r\n  first triturated with a little lard, in the cold, to make the\r\n  penetration complete, taking care that the lard be quite free from\r\n  common salt, or else Calomel will be the ultimate result: the mixture\r\n  is then to be submitted to the action of heat, and it is very\r\n  important to attend to the necessary temperature, for at 212° the\r\n  oxide and lard will not unite, at 600° the oxide will be decomposed\r\n  and the mercury volatilized, at 500° and 400° the oxide is partially\r\n  decomposed, some red oxide being formed and mercury reduced; the\r\n  proper temperature is between 300° and 320°, at which it should be\r\n  maintained for an hour, and the ointment should be stirred until cold.\r\n\r\nFootnote 715:\r\n\r\n  Four ounces, troy, of mercurial ointment, prepared six months before,\r\n  were kept at 212°, when it separated into two distinct strata, viz.\r\n  the upper one which was light grey, and extremely active as a\r\n  medicine, and the under one, which upon being triturated with\r\n  magnesia, yielded a large proportion of metallic mercury, and which\r\n  was not found to possess any activity.\r\n\r\nFootnote 716:\r\n\r\n  Whenever it is our object to direct the mercurial impression to any\r\n  particular organ, we should if possible rouse its excitability by some\r\n  specific stimulus. An exception, however, to this doctrine would seem\r\n  to offer itself in the fact, that children at the period of dentition\r\n  are not readily salivated; _a priori_, we should have certainly\r\n  supposed that a predisposition to a flux of saliva would have produced\r\n  a contrary effect. As it is, we can only conclude that those organs\r\n  are not disposed to take on any action that may be incompatible with,\r\n  or adverse to, that of dentition.\r\n\r\nFootnote 717:\r\n\r\n  The Unguentum Werholfii, so long celebrated on the Continent, was a\r\n  combination of this kind.\r\n\r\nFootnote 718:\r\n\r\n  Basilicon, i. e. the _Royal_ Ointment.\r\n\r\n  BAILEY’S ITCH OINTMENT. This is a very complicated combination;\r\n  containing Nitre, Alum, Sulphate of Zinc, and Cinnabar, made into an\r\n  ointment with Olive oil and Lard, and perfumed with the essential oils\r\n  of Anise Seeds, Origanum, and Lavender; and coloured with Alkanet\r\n  root.\r\n\r\n  The Indians use an ointment in inveterate itch, which is said to prove\r\n  very successful, and consists of finely powdered Cocculus Indicus\r\n  mixed with a little warm Castor oil.\r\n\r\nFootnote 719:\r\n\r\n  I have been lately informed by a practical chemist, that he has\r\n  occasionally found his hydrogen, when produced by zinc and dilute\r\n  acid, to contain a portion of Arsenuretted hydrogen; a fact which\r\n  confirms the assertion of Roloff.\r\n\r\nFootnote 720:\r\n\r\n  The various quack remedies advertised for the cure of the hooping\r\n  cough are either Opiates, or medicines composed of sulphate of zinc.\r\n  The nostrum, sold under the name of Anti-pertussis, contains this\r\n  metallic salt as its principal ingredient.\r\n\r\nFootnote 721:\r\n\r\n  OXLEY’S CONCENTRATED ESSENCE OF JAMAICA GINGER.—A mere solution of\r\n  Ginger in Rectified spirit.\r\n\r\n  GINGER BEER POWDERS.—White sugar, ʒj ℈ij, ginger grs. v. sub-carbonate\r\n  of soda grs. xxvj, in blue paper.

These proportions are directed for half a pint of water.\r\n\r\n  GINGER BEER.—The following is the receipt by which this popular\r\n  beverage is prepared. Take of lump sugar half a pound; of cream of\r\n  tartar half an ounce; Bruised Ginger an ounce; boiling water one\r\n  gallon. Ferment for twenty-four hours with yeast.\r\n\r\n  PRESERVED GINGER.—That from India is almost transparent, while that\r\n  manufactured in Europe is always opaque and fibrous.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          TRANSCRIBER’S NOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.
