If the evils are in reality\r\nlarger and the benefits smaller than in the common view they appear to\r\nbe, such studies should furnish convincing evidence of this fact and\r\nafford a basis for an enlightened policy whenever there is danger of\r\ninternational conflicts.\r\n\r\nStudies of the causes of warfare will reveal, in particular, those\r\neconomic influences which in time of peace bring about clashing\r\ninterests and mutual suspicion and hostility. They will, it is believed,\r\nshow what policies, as adopted by different nations, will reduce the\r\nconflicts of interest, inure to the common benefit, and afford a basis\r\nfor international confidence and good will. They will further reveal the\r\nnatural economic influences which of themselves bring about more and\r\nmore harmonious relations and tend to substitute general benefits for\r\nthe mutual injuries that follow unintelligent self-seeking. Economic\r\ninternationalism needs to be fortified by the mutual trust that just\r\ndealing creates; but just conduct itself may be favoured by economic\r\nconditions. These, in turn, may be created partly by a natural evolution\r\nand partly by the conscious action of governments; and both evolution\r\nand public action are among the important subjects of investigation.\r\n\r\nAn appeal to reason is in order when excited feelings render armed\r\nconflicts imminent; but it is quite as surely called for when no\r\nexcitement exists and when it may be forestalled and prevented from\r\ndeveloping by sound national policies. To furnish a scientific basis for\r\nreasonable international policies is the purpose of some of the studies\r\nalready in progress and of more that will hereafter be undertaken.\r\n\r\nThe publications of the Division of Economics and History are under the\r\ndirection of a Committee of Research, the membership of which includes\r\nthe statesmen, publicists, and economists who participated in the\r\nConference at Berne in 1911, and two who have since been added. The list\r\nof members at present is as follows:\r\n\r\nEUGÈNE BOREL, Professor of Public and International Law in the\r\nUniversity of Geneva.\r\n\r\nLUJO BRENTANO, Professor of Economics in the University of Munich;\r\nMember of the Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GIDE, Professor of Comparative Social Economics in the\r\nUniversity of Paris.\r\n\r\nH. B. GREVEN, Professor of Political Economy and Statistics in the\r\nUniversity of Leiden.\r\n\r\nFRANCIS W. HIRST, Editor of _The Economist_, London.\r\n\r\nDAVID KINLEY, Vice-President of the University of Illinois.\r\n\r\nHENRI LA FONTAINE, Senator of Belgium.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency LUIGI LUZZATTI, Professor of Constitutional Law in the\r\nUniversity of Rome; Secretary of the Treasury, 1891–3; Prime Minister of\r\nItaly, 1908–11.\r\n\r\nGOTARO OGAWA, Professor of Finance at the University of Kioto, Japan.\r\n\r\nSir GEORGE PAISH, Joint Editor of _The Statist_, London.\r\n\r\nMAFFEO PANTALEONI, Professor of Political Economy in the University of\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nEUGEN PHILIPPOVICH VON PHILIPPSBERG, Professor of Political Economy in\r\nthe University of Vienna; Member of the Austrian Herrenhaus, Hofrat.\r\n\r\nPAUL S. REINSCH, United States Minister to China.\r\n\r\nHis Excellency BARON Y. SAKATANI, recently Minister of Finance; Present\r\nMayor of Tokio.\r\n\r\nTHEODOR SCHIEMANN, Professor of the History of Eastern Europe in the\r\nUniversity of Berlin.\r\n\r\nHARALD WESTERGAARD, Professor of Political Science and Statistics in the\r\nUniversity of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\nFRIEDRICH, FREIHERR VON WIESER, Professor of Political Economy at the\r\nUniversity of Vienna.\r\n\r\nThe function of members of this Committee is to select collaborators\r\ncompetent to conduct investigations and present reports in the form of\r\nbooks or monographs; to consult with these writers as to plans of study;\r\nto read the completed manuscripts, and to inform the officers of the\r\nEndowment whether they merit publication in its series. This editorial\r\nfunction does not commit the members of the Committee to any opinions\r\nexpressed by the writers. Like other editors, they are asked to vouch\r\nfor the usefulness of the works, their scientific and literary merit,\r\nand the advisability of issuing them. In like manner, the publication of\r\nthe monographs does not commit the Endowment as a body or any of its\r\nofficers to the opinions which may be expressed in them. The standing\r\nand attainments of the writers selected afford a guarantee of\r\nthoroughness of research and accuracy in the statement of facts, and the\r\ncharacter of many of the works will be such that facts, statistical,\r\nhistorical, and descriptive, will constitute nearly the whole of their\r\ncontent. In so far as the opinions of the writers are revealed, they are\r\nneither approved nor condemned by the fact that the Endowment causes\r\nthem to be published. For example, the publication of a work describing\r\nthe attitude of various socialistic bodies on the subject of peace and\r\nwar implies nothing as to the views of the officers of the Endowment on\r\nthe subject of socialism; neither will the issuing of a work, describing\r\nthe attitude of business classes toward peace and war, imply any\r\nagreement or disagreement on the part of the officers of the Endowment\r\nwith the views of men of these classes as to a protective policy, the\r\ncontrol of monopoly, or the regulation of banking and currency. It is\r\nnecessary to know how such men generally think and feel on the great\r\nissue of war, and it is one of the purposes of the Endowment to promote\r\nstudies which will accurately reveal their attitude. Neither it nor its\r\nCommittee of Research vouches for more than that the works issued by\r\nthem contain such facts; that their statements concerning them may\r\ngenerally be trusted, and that the works are, in a scientific way, of a\r\nquality that entitles them to a reading.\r\n\r\nThis monograph on epidemics resulting from wars is designed to bring\r\ninto light an aspect of international conflict that has never been\r\nadequately appreciated. An examination of the facts here presented will\r\nindicate that until comparatively recent times the most serious human\r\ncost of war has been not losses in the field, nor even the losses from\r\ndisease in the armies, but the losses from epidemics disseminated among\r\nthe civil populations. It was the war epidemics and their sequelae,\r\nrather than direct military losses, that accounted for the deep\r\nprostration of Germany after the Thirty Years’ War. Such epidemics were\r\nalso the gravest consequence of the Napoleonic Wars.\r\n\r\nIt may appear that a study of war epidemics can have only historical\r\ninterest, in view of the progress of modern medical science. Plague,\r\ncholera, and typhus can be brought under control by modern methods of\r\nsanitation. One can point to the fact that in the present great war, the\r\nonly serious epidemic that has been reported is the typhus fever\r\nepidemic in Serbia. When the medical history of the war comes to be\r\nwritten, however, it will be found that the aggregate losses from\r\nsporadic outbreaks of war epidemics have been very considerable. A war\r\nsufficiently protracted to lead to universal impoverishment and a\r\nbreakdown of medical organization would be attended, as in earlier\r\ntimes, by the whole series of devastating war epidemics. And even in the\r\ncase of less exhausting wars, the chances of widespread epidemics is far\r\nfrom negligible. There is much food for reflection in the author’s\r\naccount of the small-pox epidemic following the Franco-German War. In\r\n1870 the means of coping with small-pox were as nearly perfect as they\r\nare in the greater part of the world to-day. This fact did not save\r\nEurope from a widespread epidemic, entailing human losses exceeding in\r\ngravity the losses in the field. To-day, as in the past, the\r\nprobabilities of increased morbidity in the civil population, not only\r\namong the belligerents, but among neutrals as well, must be entered as a\r\nhighly important debit item against war.\r\n\r\n                                                 JOHN BATES CLARK,\r\n                                                             _Director_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n INTRODUCTION                                                          1\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER I\r\n\r\n WAR PESTILENCES                                                       4\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n THE TIME BEFORE THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR                                11\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR                                                25\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA AND THE FRENCH\r\n   REVOLUTION                                                         79\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON’S RUSSIAN\r\n   CAMPAIGN                                                           92\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n THE EPIDEMICS OF TYPHUS FEVER IN CENTRAL EUROPE FOLLOWING UPON THE\r\n   RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN AND DURING THE WARS OF LIBERATION (1812–14)      106\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n FROM THE AGE OF NAPOLEON TO THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR                   165\r\n\r\n    1.

This is\r\ncaused chiefly by the infectious diseases which in war times so often\r\nappear in the form of epidemics. These diseases, moreover, not only\r\nafflict the country in which the war is waged, but are also carried by\r\nprisoners, returning soldiers, and in other ways, into the land of the\r\nvictor, where it is possible for them to spread over a large territory.\r\nA report on the loss of human life among that part of a population which\r\ndoes not participate in a war has not yet been undertaken, writings on\r\nwar pestilences usually confining themselves to the losses within the\r\narmies themselves.[1] It is the purpose of the present study to\r\ninvestigate the losses sustained by the non-belligerent part of the\r\npopulation in consequence of epidemics caused by wars.\r\n\r\nIn doing this it seems advisable to select a few war pestilences which\r\non account of their enormous extent are particularly notable, and to\r\nsubject them to an exhaustive discussion. This method has the advantage\r\nthat it will enable us to show in individual cases how it is possible\r\nfor these pestilences to extend over such a vast territory, under what\r\ncircumstances they spread from place to place, and how they enter\r\nregions remote from the scene of war. For this exhaustive discussion the\r\nwriter has chosen the pestilences that occurred during the Thirty Years’\r\nWar, the epidemic of typhus fever after Napoleon’s Russian Campaign, and\r\nthe pandemic of small-pox after the Franco-German War of 1870–1. These\r\nepidemics afford very instructive examples of what horrible losses both\r\nfriends and enemies may sustain in consequence of war pestilences.\r\n\r\nWhile the outbreaks of ‘plague’ in the course of the Thirty Years’ War\r\nhave already been made the subject of a comprehensive account, strange\r\nto say there are no such accounts of the other two epidemics; to give a\r\nclear picture of these pestilences the writer was therefore constrained\r\nto collect the necessary information from widely dispersed sources. In\r\ngathering his material a number of large German libraries assisted him\r\nmost kindly—particularly, the Royal National Library at Stuttgart and\r\nthe University libraries of Strassburg and Tübingen.\r\n\r\nThe other parts of the history of war pestilences are set forth in a\r\nmore general way; for an exhaustive treatment of them would have\r\nnecessitated several years of preliminary work, which the writer in the\r\nshort time at his disposal was unable to undertake.\r\n\r\nThe writer has drawn as much as possible from original sources; this\r\napplies at least to the pestilences of the Napoleonic Period, and to the\r\nepidemic of small-pox after the Franco-German War. It would have been\r\nimpossible to deal with the other wars in the same way without consuming\r\nconsiderable time. From the bibliographies it will appear what sources\r\nthe author has consulted; rarely are quotations given from works which\r\nhe has not seen, and in such cases it is indicated whence they were\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the origin and spread of pestilences during a war are\r\nclear. Every aggregation of people, even in times of peace, at\r\ncelebrations and annual fairs, in barracks, and so forth, is necessarily\r\nexposed to the danger of pestilence; but this danger is ten times as\r\ngreat in large assemblages of troops during a war. The soldiers are then\r\nsubjected to all possible kinds of hardship and suffering—lack of food,\r\nor food which is inferior and badly cooked, sleeping out in the cold and\r\nrain, fatiguing marches, constant excitement, and homesickness—and all\r\nthese things greatly lessen their power of resistance. When large bodies\r\nof troops are obliged to remain in one and the same place for a\r\nconsiderable length of time, the additional difficulty presents itself\r\nof keeping the locality unpolluted by the excrement of men and animals,\r\nand by refuse of all kinds. If an infectious disease reveals its\r\npresence in such an aggregation of people, energetic and stringent\r\nmeasures must be adopted, even in times of peace, to prevent it from\r\nspreading. In war times it is often impossible to take the necessary\r\nprecautions, since the attention of the commanders is directed toward\r\nvery definite objects, to which all other considerations are\r\nsubordinate. Whether the germ of the disease is already in the place, or\r\nwhether the soldiers bring it with them, in either case there is danger\r\nthat the fighting armies will cause the disease to spread over the\r\nentire scene of the war, and thus seriously endanger thousands of human\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nModern methods of sanitation have done much toward preventing the spread\r\nof army pestilences, not only in peace, but also in war. The last few\r\ndecades have evinced that fact. Whatever attitude we may assume toward\r\nthe question whether war can ever be wholly abolished, we must all agree\r\nthat, if war has once broken out, all possible means must be employed to\r\nprevent the spreading of pestilence within the armies. Here the\r\ninterests of the people and of the commanders coincide, since the\r\nefficiency of armies is often seriously interfered with by the outbreak\r\nof pestilence, and not infrequently the success or failure of a war\r\ndepends, not upon the outcome of its battles, but upon the appearance or\r\nnon-appearance of pestilence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                            WAR PESTILENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nAll infectious diseases may spread in consequence of war and develop\r\ninto epidemics of varying extent. In the next chapter we shall see how\r\nthe wars at the end of the fifteenth century favoured the spread of an\r\nepidemic of syphilis. In the Union Army, during the American Civil War\r\nof 1861–5, both measles and typhoid fever were very widespread, and\r\ntogether they were the cause of 4,246 deaths, or about 1·75 per cent of\r\nthe total enlistment. Scarlet fever, influenza, yellow fever, relapsing\r\nfever, and malaria (if the war is waged in countries where this disease\r\nis endemic—especially in the Lower Danube region, in the Netherlands,\r\nSpain, and Italy) have also played an important rôle in many wars. But\r\nwe give the name ‘war pestilences’ only to those infectious diseases\r\nwhich in the course of centuries have usually followed at the heels of\r\nbelligerent armies, such as typhus fever, bubonic plague, cholera,\r\ntyphoid fever, dysentery, and small-pox; we may also include here\r\nscurvy, the etiology of which has not yet been definitely determined.\r\n\r\n1. _Typhus fever_ (spotted fever, exanthematic typhus—called in France\r\nand England simply typhus, in Spain tabardillo[2]—formerly called\r\ncontagious typhus, hunger typhus, camp fever, and Hungarian fever) is an\r\nacute infectious disease of cyclic recurrence, which resembles typhoid\r\nfever only in name. From the eighth to the tenth day after infection,\r\noften somewhat sooner or later, it begins with a chill, accompanied by\r\nnausea, vomiting, violent headache, and psychic depression. In the first\r\nfew days the patient’s temperature rises rapidly, and on the fourth or\r\nfifth day a rash in the form of dull-red spots, as large as a pea,\r\nbreaks out over the entire body. These spots gradually grow larger, and\r\nafter two or three days, through the appearance of very small\r\nhaemorrhages, change into petechiae. The apathy of which the patient\r\nfirst gave evidence now gives way to wild delirium. At the end of the\r\nsecond week the temperature falls rapidly, and in one or two days\r\nbecomes normal; often, however, the fall of temperature takes from six\r\nto eight days. The duration of the entire disease, accordingly, is from\r\ntwo to two and a half weeks. Death usually occurs at the crisis of the\r\ndisease—from the tenth to the twelfth day—rarely between the sixth and\r\nninth days or after the twelfth.\r\n\r\nThe danger of the disease varies greatly in different epidemics;\r\nstatements regarding this point diverge according as we refer to the\r\nstatistical records of hospitals or to the private practice of\r\nphysicians. With the latter the number of deaths is smaller, since\r\npersons suffering from the disease in mild form less often go to the\r\nhospitals. Epidemics in which a quarter of the patients, and even more,\r\nhave succumbed have frequently occurred, especially in war times, during\r\nfamines, &c. The cause (infective agent) of typhus fever is not known;\r\naccording to recent investigations it is spread by vermin; Ricketts and\r\nothers have fixed responsibility for it upon the body louse. The\r\ninfection is communicated from man to man, and very often it is\r\ncontracted from the clothes, linen, and other effects of typhus\r\npatients. Recovery from the disease usually renders a person immune\r\nagainst a second attack. Typhus fever frequently appears nowadays in the\r\neastern and south-eastern parts of Europe, in Hungary and Galicia, and\r\nalso in Spain, Italy, and Ireland.\r\n\r\n2. _Plague_ appears in two forms, depending upon the place where the\r\ninfective agent enters the body: the bubonic plague and the pneumonic\r\nplague. In the case of the former the painful plague-sores (buboes)\r\ndevelop, usually two or three days after infection, from the lymphatic\r\nglands; these sores,—which appear most often in the region of the groin,\r\nless often in the axilla, on the neck, lower jaw, and in other\r\nplaces,—soon suppurate. There is either a development of toxins, which\r\nare the cause of the severe general symptoms, or else the _bacilli\r\npestis_ go from the glands into the circulatory system and cause\r\nsepticaemia, which is quickly fatal. Pneumonic plague takes the form of\r\na catarrhal inflammation of the lungs, causing a profuse and bloody\r\nexpectoration, which contains large quantities of bacilli. This form of\r\nthe disease almost always ends fatally in a few days. The mortality of\r\nbubonic plague is somewhat lower; the disease has an average duration of\r\neight days, and carries away from fifty to seventy per cent of its\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages an epidemic of plague (black death) ravaged all\r\nEurope. At the present time it is still endemic in India, in southern\r\nChina, in Egypt, in Uganda, and perhaps in other countries, whence it\r\nfrequently develops into general epidemics.\r\n\r\nThe infective agent in the case of plague is the _bacillus pestis_,\r\nidentified in 1894 by Kitasato, and subsequently, but independently, by\r\nYersin. Rats, which are very susceptible to the disease, play an\r\nimportant rôle in spreading it; in India the outbreak of a plague\r\nepidemic is always preceded by the dying of large numbers of rats. Their\r\nexcrement contains large quantities of bacilli, which may be destructive\r\nto human beings. The rat-flea is also known to carry the infection. The\r\ninfection may be conveyed directly by plague patients, when the buboes\r\nsuppurate, or when the blood becomes generally infected with the\r\n_bacilli pestis_, which are contained in abundance in the sputum, urine,\r\nand excrement, or when the lungs are affected and the patient charges\r\nthe atmosphere by coughing. One who has recovered from the disease is\r\nusually immune for life.\r\n\r\n3. _Cholera_, after an incubation period of two to eight days, begins\r\nwith frequent (ten to twenty times a day) vomitings of a fluid like\r\nrice-water, and incessant retching. The patient, owing to the great loss\r\nof water, sinks rapidly; he acquires a corpse-like appearance, loses\r\nconsciousness, and death may result on the first or second day. If the\r\nattack is survived, the patient frequently dies from sheer exhaustion\r\nafterwards. The mortality of cholera is great—from forty to fifty per\r\ncent of its victims die. In this calculation the numerous cases of\r\ncholerine, that are always prevalent during cholera times, are excluded.\r\nRecovery from the disease does not protect a person against contracting\r\nit again. The infective germ in the case of cholera is the ‘comma\r\nbacillus’, discovered by Robert Koch in 1883. The spread of cholera is\r\ncaused by the penetration of the _comma bacillus_ into the alimentary\r\ncanal, resulting from contact with objects which have been contaminated\r\nby the evacuations of cholera patients; less frequently it is indirectly\r\ncaused by the pollution, from evacuations, of water used for drinking or\r\nwashing purposes.\r\n\r\n4. _Dysentery_ has always played an important rôle in military\r\ncampaigns. To be sure, it is not very dangerous, so far as the patient’s\r\nlife is concerned, but in war times, owing to irregular nursing and\r\nscanty nourishment, and the consequent use of unsuitable food, it may\r\nspread over a large territory and be very destructive to large numbers\r\nof soldiers and other people.\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct forms of the disease—amoebic dysentery and\r\nbacillary dysentery. The latter is caused by the _bacillus pyocyaneus_,\r\ndiscovered independently by Stiga, Kruse, and Flexner. The disease used\r\nto be common throughout Europe; at the present time it appears in\r\nCentral and Western Europe only in small epidemics, whereas in Eastern\r\nEurope it spreads over large territories. It causes frequent, often\r\nblood-coloured, defecations, accompanied by griping pains in the abdomen\r\nand a distressing pressure (tenesmus). The disease lasts from one to one\r\nand a half weeks, but for a long time after recovery the patient’s\r\nalimentary canal is very sensitive to improper nourishment. The disease\r\nis transmitted either by direct contact, since the evacuations of the\r\nbowels contain large quantities of bacilli, or by infected water.\r\nAmoebic dysentery, occurring in tropical countries (Southern Europe,\r\nEgypt, Southern Asia, Central America, &c.), is much more dangerous; it\r\nis caused by an amoeba, carefully studied by Kartulis, and very often\r\nacquires a chronic character, sometimes causing abscess of the liver.\r\n\r\n5. _Typhoid fever_ (called in England ‘enteric fever’, in France\r\n‘fièvre typhoïde’, in Italy ‘febbre tifoidea’) in many wars has been\r\nvery widespread among the armies; for example, in the American Civil\r\nWar, in the Franco-German War (Metz), and in the Russo-Turkish War of\r\n1877–8. The progress of the disease is well known; between the time of\r\ninfection and the outbreak of the sickness nine to eleven days usually\r\nintervene, sometimes even as much as three weeks. In the first week\r\nthe temperature of the patient rises slowly, during the second week it\r\nremains at about the same height, while in the third week it abates\r\nconsiderably, becoming normal in the course of the fourth week. The\r\nspleen enlarges a great deal, and in the second week small pale-red\r\nspots (roseola), scarcely as large as a pea, appear on the buttocks\r\nand especially on the belly. The patient’s bowel-movements, at first\r\nnormal, now becomes diarrhoeal, while certain psychic disorders also\r\nmanifest themselves, usually in the form of a heavy somnolence. In the\r\nthird week the patient’s life is threatened by complications in the\r\nintestines—haemorrhage or perforation. Characteristic of the disease\r\nare the anatomical changes of the small intestine—at first\r\nenlargement, and later ulceration of Peyer’s patches. The infective\r\nagent in the case of typhoid fever is a bacillus, identified by Gaffky\r\nin 1882. It lodges in the alimentary canal, and is conveyed by food\r\nthat has been touched with hands to which matter containing the\r\nbacillus has adhered, or else in contaminated water used for drinking\r\nor other purposes. From eight to ten per cent of the patients die,\r\nwhile a single recovery usually insures immunity against a second\r\nattack.\r\n\r\n6. _Small-pox_ has an incubation period of ten to fourteen days. The\r\ndisease begins with a chill, accompanied by violent headache. On the\r\nthird day the eruption appears; little papules develop and quickly\r\nchange into pustules, showing themselves first on the face, then on the\r\nback, arms, and hands, and finally on the legs and feet. On the ninth\r\nday the pustules suppurate, and after that gradually dry up; if it\r\nprogresses favourably, the disease is over in two or two and a half\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\nIn the case of small-pox the infective agent is not yet known; infection\r\nis caused by contact with a patient, or with objects which he is using\r\nor has used. It is particularly dangerous to touch things on which the\r\ncontents of the pustules have dried, for such articles remain infectious\r\nfor a long time. Recovery from the disease usually renders a person\r\nimmune for life. The mortality in different epidemics varies greatly;\r\nmost dangerous of all is the so-called ‘black small-pox’ (haemorrhagic\r\nsmall-pox, with bleeding in the pustules and under the skin). The total\r\nnumber of deaths in an epidemic of small-pox is dependent upon whether\r\nthe disease appears in a vaccinated or an unvaccinated community; in the\r\nlatter case the mortality may reach thirty per cent, whereas in the\r\nformer case only three or four per cent of the patients die. Vaccination\r\nrenders a person immune for eight to twelve years, while, if the disease\r\nbreaks out anywhere in spite of vaccination, the number of fatal cases\r\nis very few. It should be noted that small-pox was formerly dreaded, not\r\nonly because of its danger to life, but also because it frequently\r\nleaves a person disfigured for life, and in rare instances causes total\r\nblindness.\r\n\r\n7. _Scorbutus_ (scurvy) used to be a common disease on ships, in\r\nprisons, and in times of famine; it appeared with the greatest\r\nmalignancy in besieged cities—Thorn, Nuremberg, Alexandria, Port Arthur,\r\n&c. The real cause of the disease is unknown, although too much food of\r\none kind, particularly lack of fresh vegetables, together with long\r\nconfinement in poorly ventilated and dark rooms, are important causative\r\nfactors. Inasmuch as the disease almost always appears in the form of an\r\nepidemic, it is probable that there is a specific infective agent. It\r\nbegins with a general feeling of weakness; the skin and mucous membranes\r\nbecome pale and sallow, the gums become inflamed and ulcerated, and\r\nsmall and large extravasations of blood take place in the skin and\r\nmuscles, and at the joints and knuckles. In serious cases haemorrhages\r\noccur in the intestines, kidneys, bladder, and uterus. A change of diet\r\nand surroundings will quickly cure scurvy; otherwise progressive anaemia\r\nwill result in death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                 THE TIME BEFORE THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous as are the historical notices in former years regarding the\r\ndestruction of armies by pestilence, correspondingly few are the\r\ndetailed reports on the spread of pestilence among the non-belligerent\r\npopulation. The best-known example from antiquity is the _Plague of\r\nAthens_ (430–425 B.C.), described by Thucydides. The plague began in the\r\nsecond year of the Peloponnesian War, a few days after the invasion of\r\nthe Peloponnesians. That it is famous is due to the classical\r\ndescription of it by Thucydides, himself a sufferer from the disease.\r\nThe Plague of Athens broke out in the Piraeus, a fact which has led to\r\nthe inference that it was borne thither by mariners from Egypt. At the\r\ntime of the invasion of the Peloponnesians, thousands of country people\r\nfled to the city of Athens, which on the advice of Pericles opened its\r\ngates to them; thus more than 400,000 people were crowded together\r\nwithin its walls. The first outbreak of the plague lasted two years,\r\nthen there was an intermission of a year and a half, whereupon it\r\ncommenced anew. The second outbreak, according to Diodorus, carried away\r\n4,400 hoplites, 300 cavalrymen, a large (but uncertain) number of other\r\nsoldiers, and 10,000 women and slaves. The plague also penetrated to\r\nother places, sparing, however, the Peloponnesus. The nature of the\r\nsickness described by Thucydides cannot be positively determined; it has\r\nbeen referred to as bubonic plague (Sprengel), as small-pox\r\n(Krause-Daremberg, Kobert), as typhus fever (Häser, Kanngiesser), as\r\ntyphoid fever (Seitz), and even as anthrax. All we know for certain is\r\nthat it was some highly infectious disease, recovery from which rendered\r\na person immune. Krauss and Hecker believe that it was a special disease\r\n(‘antique plague’), which no longer occurs.[3]\r\n\r\nThe _Plague of the Antonines_, also called the ‘Plague of Galen’, which\r\nravaged Italy in A.D. 166–8, has also been brought into connexion with\r\nwarlike events. Avidius Cassius, who preceded Verus in command of the\r\narmy, had been sent to Syria for the purpose of suppressing a rebellion,\r\nand there, after the capture of Seleucia, the plague broke out. It was\r\nborne by the troops back to Rome, where, after the triumphal procession\r\nof 166, it spread far and wide, so that it was necessary to load its\r\nvictims on wagons and carry them off for burial. The plague spread from\r\nItaly to Gaul, to the very banks of the Rhine, and a large part of the\r\nprovince was literally depopulated—decayed and deserted villages were\r\nfound everywhere. Häser inclines to the view that it was an epidemic of\r\nsmall-pox, while Laveran, Hecker, Krause, and Littré believe that it was\r\nneither small-pox nor typhus fever, but ‘antique plague’.[4]\r\n\r\nThe expeditions of the German emperors to Italy, as well as the\r\nCrusades, offer numerous examples of how large armies may be destroyed\r\nby disease. So, for instance, in 963 or 964 the army of the Emperor Otto\r\nI was attacked by a severe pestilence in Italy—a murderous disease which\r\nwas usually fatal in twenty-four hours. The German army of Henry IV in\r\n1081–2, but especially after the capture of Rome on June 3, 1083,\r\nsuffered from plagues in Italy; but the same army fared even worse in\r\n1084, when a plague broke out and carried away, for example, the entire\r\nGerman garrison in Rome. In 1137 Lothair’s army was likewise attacked by\r\ninfectious diseases in Italy. But by far the most devastating of all was\r\nthe pestilence which broke out in Rome in August, 1167, shortly after\r\nthe capture of the city by Frederick Barbarossa, and paved the way to a\r\ncatastrophe which culminated in the complete annihilation of the German\r\narmy. At that time many eminent men succumbed to the disease, the army\r\ndwindled away in the hands of the leaders, and the soldiers fled in vast\r\nnumbers in order to escape certain death. Even after the Emperor\r\nBarbarossa’s withdrawal from Rome the pestilence continued to rage in\r\nhis army, and it was a long time before it disappeared from the city. It\r\nwas the true (bubonic) plague, and usually resulted fatally on the first\r\nday. In the winter of 1190–1 a pestilence broke out in Lower Italy in\r\nthe army of Henry VI; it appeared at the beginning of the siege of\r\nNaples and carried away many eminent men. The king himself contracted\r\nthe disease, and had to be taken to Capua.[5]\r\n\r\nThe armies of the Crusades fared even worse; the mortality in the First\r\nCrusade, before and after the conquest of Antioch (1097–8), was\r\nterrible. The pestilence is said to have broken out first among the\r\nchildren and women who accompanied the armies, and its dissemination was\r\nfavoured by a lack of sustenance and continual rainfall; from September\r\nto the 24th of November the pestilence carried away 100,000. The nature\r\nof the disease is not known, although it is known to have been very\r\ninfectious. When a new army of 1,500 Germans arrived, it was quickly\r\nattacked by the disease and in a few days almost completely annihilated.\r\nSeveral hundred frequently died in a single day, and as the summer of\r\n1099 was very hot and a number of bodies remained unburied, the\r\npestilence lasted well into that year. In 1100 another pestilence raged\r\namong the crusaders. Again, during the Second Crusade a severe epidemic\r\nbroke out in the army of the Emperor Louis VII at Attalia in Asia Minor;\r\nthe pestilence spread rapidly among the inhabitants of the city, so that\r\nmany houses, even entire streets, were depopulated.[6]\r\n\r\nDuring the Third Crusade, shortly after the death of Frederick\r\nBarbarossa (June, 1190), a severe pestilence broke out in the army that\r\nwas besieging Antioch; according to Michaux only 5,000 infantrymen and\r\n700 cavalrymen survived out of the entire German army.[7] At the siege\r\nof Acre (Ptolemais), which lasted from August 1189, to July 1191, there\r\nbroke out in the winter of 1191 a terrible pestilence which played havoc\r\nin the pilgrim army; it was caused by an inadequate supply of food, and\r\nits symptoms (enlargement of the limbs and falling out of the teeth)\r\nbetoken scurvy. It also appeared in the army of Saladin, but was much\r\nworse in the Christian army, in which from 100 to 200 crusaders died\r\nevery day. Duke Frederick of Swabia succumbed to this disease on January\r\n20, 1191.[8]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the crusade against the heretics a serious pestilence\r\nbroke out in Egypt in the army of the crusaders, which had already, on\r\nAugust 12, 1218, suffered from dysentery; it appeared in December during\r\nthe siege of Damietta, after a heavy and continuous downfall of rain.\r\n‘The patients’, says Wilken, ‘were suddenly seized with violent pains in\r\nthe feet and ankles; their gums became swollen, their teeth loose and\r\nuseless, while their hips and shin bones first turned black and then\r\nputrefied. Finally, an easy and peaceful death, like a gentle sleep, put\r\nan end to their sufferings. A sixth of the pilgrim army was carried away\r\nby this disease, which no medicine could cure.’[9] Only a few patients\r\nwho survived the winter were helped to recovery by the warmth of spring.\r\nIt was unquestionably a severe form of scurvy. The besieged, too,\r\nsuffered from the destructive pestilence, and also from Egyptian\r\nophthalmia. We read further in Wilken: ‘A horrible sight greeted the\r\npilgrims when they took possession of Damietta. Not only the houses, but\r\neven the streets were filled with unburied corpses; in the beds dead\r\nbodies lay beside helpless and dying invalids, and the infection of the\r\nair was intolerable. Of 80,000 inhabitants which the city had had at the\r\nbeginning of the siege only 3,000 were left, while only 100 of these\r\nwere healthy.’[10] Other reports say that 10,000 inhabitants survived.\r\n\r\nIn 1270, during the Seventh and last Crusade, which strangely enough\r\npassed by way of Tunis, a pestilential disease broke out in Carthage,\r\ncarrying away, in addition to many soldiers and men of rank, King Louis\r\nIX of France himself and his son, Jean Tristan. This pestilence was\r\ndysentery, and it spread even to Sicily, whither the king’s body was\r\nconveyed. After the king’s death conditions were even worse, since so\r\nmany people died that it was impossible to bury all the bodies. The\r\ndisease also attacked the enemy’s army.[11]\r\n\r\nThe increased prevalence of _leprosy_ in Europe in the Middle Ages is\r\noften attributed to the Crusades.[12] Leprosy was very widespread in\r\nGermany, France, Italy, and other countries of Europe before the\r\nCrusades; according to Hirsch it appeared in the Roman Empire in the\r\nfirst century before the birth of Christ, but did not become very\r\nprevalent until later. Legal regulations governing the marrying of\r\nlepers date back as far as the seventh century, while the earliest\r\nreports regarding leper-houses come down from the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies. Most leper-houses, however, were built between the eleventh\r\nand thirteenth centuries, and although the reverse opinion has been\r\nexpressed, it is nevertheless improbable that the building of these\r\nhouses was not due to the increased prevalence of the disease. Inasmuch\r\nas leprosy was very widespread in the Orient, where numerous crusaders\r\ncontracted it, as indicated by the fact that institutions were founded\r\nthere for its victims, many crusaders doubtless returned with the\r\ndisease in their systems. But regarding this matter we shall never have\r\nabsolutely reliable information; for it is assumed that many people\r\nsuffering from other chronic skin diseases were placed in the\r\nleper-houses. A careful study of the available data, however, leads us\r\nto believe that wrong diagnoses were not so frequent as to account for\r\nthe large number of cases of leprosy in the eleventh, twelfth, and\r\nthirteenth centuries. Admittance to leper-houses was regulated by many\r\nprecautionary measures, and the diagnosis of the disease was made by\r\nchurchmen, even bishops, who without doubt necessarily acquired a good\r\neye for the disease in the course of time. Not until later, when we may\r\nbe certain that leprosy was no longer brought from the Orient, was the\r\ndisease probably now and then confused with syphilis.\r\n\r\nThe notable pandemic outbreak of syphilis at the end of the fifteenth\r\ncentury was also largely attributable to warlike events. The rapid\r\nspread of the disease throughout Central Europe was due, according to\r\ncontemporary notices, to the _Landsknechte_ (common foot-soldiers). The\r\nrough coincidence of this epidemic with the discovery of America has\r\ngiven rise to the view that the disease did not exist in Europe at\r\nearlier periods, but was borne thither from America. But we can point to\r\nnumerous instances in the course of the last century, of how infectious\r\ndiseases, hitherto unknown, or existing only sporadically, all of a\r\nsudden became pandemic (cholera, plague, diphtheria, influenza),\r\nalthough no satisfactory and comprehensive explanation of the phenomenon\r\nhas been offered. It is generally known that infectious diseases break\r\nout in a mild form and last for years, and then suddenly change their\r\ncharacter and cause virulent epidemics; this is positively confirmed by\r\nthe epidemic of small-pox in 1870–2, which will be discussed later. At\r\nall events we cannot draw the conclusion from the sudden outbreak of an\r\nepidemic of syphilis, that the disease was not present in Europe before.\r\n\r\nA serious epidemic of syphilis broke out in the army of Charles VIII of\r\nFrance during his expedition to Naples. Inasmuch as his advance was\r\nnowhere opposed, he was able to enter Naples on February 12, 1495. There\r\nthe French army gave itself over to the most unbridled licentiousness,\r\nand the result was that the disease spread rapidly in both the French\r\nand Italian armies. Italians and Frenchmen accused each other of having\r\nbrought the disease, so that the former called syphilis ‘French disease’\r\nand the later ‘Neapolitan disease’. The disbanding of Charles’s army\r\ncaused the disease to spread far and wide in Europe. ‘Those who had most\r\nto do with the further dissemination of the disease,’ says Häser,[13]\r\n‘were the Albanian and Roumanian estradiots serving in the Venetian\r\narmy, brutal and rapacious adventurers, and also the German and Swiss\r\n_Landsknechte_ returning from Italy, who spread the disease over a large\r\npart of Europe.’\r\n\r\nA large number of writers of the beginning of the sixteenth century bear\r\nwitness to the fact that the pestilence was borne into Germany by\r\n_Landsknechte_; e.g. Pastor N. Berler (_Ruffachische Chronik_ of 1510),\r\nHeinrich Brennwald (1519), Johann Haselbergk (1533), Valentin Müntzer\r\n(1550), _Nuremberg Chronicle_ of 1580.[14] In the year 1495 the\r\npestilence broke out in many places in France and Germany; in\r\nStrassburg, for example, the disease was planted by _Landsknechte_ who\r\nhad served in, and been discharged from, the army of Charles VIII; Hans\r\nSchott testifies to this fact in his _Weltlich Leyenbuch_ (Strassburg,\r\n1541). The city of Metz tried in vain to ward off the disease; according\r\nto the _Metz Chronicle_, many Burgundians (500 cavalrymen and 700\r\ninfantrymen) came to Metz in May 1495, and since the most of them were\r\nsuffering from _mal de Naples_, they were not allowed to enter the city.\r\nBut the soldiers infected the women in the vicinity, and the disease was\r\nlater borne by them into the city, where it prevailed for four years,\r\nnot beginning to abate until the year 1500.[15] We also have testimony\r\nto the fact that the outbreak of the disease in Nördlingen (1495) was\r\ncaused by the arrival of _Landsknechte_.\r\n\r\nIn a supplementary way we may add here that later wars also caused\r\nfrequent epidemics of syphilis within narrow confines; instances of this\r\nkind are cited by A. Hirsch[16] and H. Schwiening.[17]\r\n\r\nIn August of the year 1486 _English sweating-sickness_ appeared in\r\nEngland for the first time; it broke out among the troops of Henry VII\r\nshortly before his victory at Bosworth on August 22, 1486. And when\r\nHenry landed at Milford the disease spread, carrying away many victims\r\nwherever it went. ‘Strong and well-nourished people were particularly\r\nsusceptible to it—more so than old men, children, and poor people. From\r\nthree to nine, sometimes all the inmates of a house caught it, and it\r\ngradually spread over half the inhabitants of the town. The first\r\nappearance of the disease is said to have caused more devastation in\r\nLondon (where it broke out on September 21), Bedford, and Cambridge,\r\nthan the sword, which had been ruling for thirty years in a fearful\r\ncivil war. According to Forest, an incredible number of people died from\r\nit, while Thomas Moore also speaks of the dangerous character of this\r\nepidemic. In many places a third of the inhabitants are said to have\r\ndied from it, scarcely one in a hundred of its victims recovering.’[18]\r\nThe subsequent appearance of the disease, especially the transplantation\r\nof it to the continent in the year 1529, was not attributable to warlike\r\nevents. In the year 1551 it disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared\r\nin 1486.\r\n\r\nThe disease usually began with a chill, headache, palpitation of the\r\nheart, difficulty in breathing, and later a profuse, very malodorous\r\nemission of sweat from all parts of the body. The patient quickly lapsed\r\ninto a state of lethargy. The progress of the disease was uncommonly\r\nrapid; ‘in one day either the disease or the patient came to an end,’\r\nsays Fracastorius. Any patient who did not succumb, recovered completely\r\nafter one or two weeks.\r\n\r\nFrom the sixteenth century on notices are more abundant; we now hear of\r\nepidemics of typhus fever throughout all Europe, although we do not know\r\npositively where the disease first appeared. ‘At all times,’ says\r\nHirsch,[19] ‘as far back as historical investigation is able to follow\r\nthe course of typhus fever at all, the disease has always been bound up\r\nwith the most dismal calamities of the nations. The supposition is\r\ntherefore justified that, in the numerous war-pestilences and\r\nfamine-pestilences of antiquity and the Middle Ages, regarding which we\r\nhave no medical reports and must rely only upon the chronicles, typhus\r\nfever has played a conspicuous rôle.’ By this, however, Hirsch does not\r\nmean to say that the specific disease in all the so-called\r\nwar-pestilences was typhus fever; on the contrary, he adds: ‘In saying\r\nthis I by no means wish to imply that I always identify\r\n“war-pestilences” and “famine-pestilences” with epidemics of typhus\r\nfever; those pestilences, appearing at epochs of general misery, for the\r\nmost part represent a mixture of diseases, especially catarrh of the\r\nstomach, dysentery, scurvy, typhus fever, and frequently malaria and\r\ntyphoid fever, which not only by chroniclers, but also by medical\r\nstatisticians, have quite often been lumped together as _one disease_.’\r\nIt is to-day almost impossible to analyse these accounts, in which we\r\ncan distinguish only individual characteristics of those various\r\ndiseases. This appears most distinctly in the reports of the chroniclers\r\nand historians regarding the war pestilences and famine pestilences of\r\nantiquity, and it also explains the futile effort of the historians to\r\nreduce to one disease known to us the numerous and complicated symptoms\r\nwhich they have looked upon as the expression of a single\r\ndisease-process—an effort which has led some of them to the somewhat\r\nextravagant conclusion, that they were diseases which are now extinct.\r\nThe same backwardness, furthermore, characterizes—though to a lesser\r\nextent—the descriptions which the physicians of the seventeenth and\r\neighteenth centuries wrote of the epidemics of ‘putrid fever’, ‘bilious\r\nfever’, and ‘mucous fever’ occurring at that time. Here, too, in many\r\ncases it was evidently a question of the simultaneous outbreak of\r\nvarious diseases, the nature of which even the most expert critic could\r\nnot afterwards determine with certainty.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the fifteenth century typhus fever was prevalent in many\r\nparts of Europe; the first scientific account of it comes from the pen\r\nof Fracastorius, who had an opportunity to observe the disease during\r\nthe epidemics in Italy in 1505–8, and who described it as a disease\r\nindigenous to Cyprus and the neighbouring islands and appearing for the\r\nfirst time in Italy.\r\n\r\nThe names given to the disease were numerous and cannot all be mentioned\r\nhere; the name ‘Hauptweh’ (headache) or ‘Hauptkrankheit’ (head-disease)\r\nwas current in Germany, while the additional words ‘ohne Sterbedrüsen’\r\n(without death glands) expressly distinguish the disease from bubonic\r\nplague. T. von Györy[20] mentions a large number of synonyms—Hungarian\r\ndisease, lazaret fever, spotted fever, petechial disease, &c.\r\n\r\nIn 1490 the disease was borne by Spanish soldiers, who had fought in the\r\nVenetian army against Turkey, from Cyprus to Spain, and during the war\r\nof Ferdinand the Catholic against the Moors it spread to Granada and did\r\nmore damage to the Spanish army than the swords of the Moors.[21]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1490 a serious epidemic broke out in Lorraine, which\r\nMaréchal and Didion[22] think was typhus fever; it appeared in that\r\nbitter and indescribably cruel conflict between René, Duke of Lorraine,\r\nand the people of Metz. Despite the armistice proclaimed on June 18, the\r\npestilence spread far and wide and in August entered Metz, compelling\r\nthe inhabitants to take to flight; the nobles retired to their castles,\r\nand the citizens went out into the country. And although the city was\r\nstrictly quarantined, the disease spread throughout Lorraine and\r\nnorthern Alsace.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1528 an epidemic of typhus fever occurred in connexion with\r\nwarlike events. This pestilence broke out in Upper Italy and spread to\r\nLower Italy, where a war was going on between French troops on the one\r\nside and German and Spanish troops on the other. The loss of human life\r\nwas uncommonly large, 30,000 French soldiers and twice as many\r\nnon-belligerent inhabitants are said to have died. And the pestilence\r\nwas also borne from Italy to Germany.\r\n\r\nWell known in history is the great pestilence which in 1552 forced\r\nEmperor Charles V to raise the siege of Metz, which had been going on\r\nfor two months (November and December). Maréchal gives us detailed\r\ninformation about this;[23] the Emperor’s army, he says, which consisted\r\nof 80,000 German, Spanish, and Italian troops, in addition to the\r\nenormous camp-following that always accompanied armies at that time, was\r\nreduced one-third by the end of December through desertion, disease, and\r\ndisablement. According to the report of the Venetian physician, Andreas\r\nGratiolo, the widespread diseases were typhus fever and dysentery. The\r\nappearance of these diseases was favoured by the congregating of such\r\nenormous numbers of people in tents and inadequate places of shelter,\r\nand also by the great dampness and the lack of the necessaries of life.\r\nThe extreme cold, which prevented the dispersion and isolation of the\r\npatients, also favoured the dissemination of the disease. More than 200\r\nmen died in the barracks every day, while 10,000 men, all told, are said\r\nto have succumbed. It was also observed that the Spaniards and Italians\r\nsuffered more than the _Landsknechte_ and other German troops, since\r\nthey could not stand the severity of the climate so well. During the\r\nsiege, hospital-fever and scurvy raged in the city itself, and after the\r\nsiege was raised, in the night of January 1, 1553, typhus fever broke\r\nout there, having been borne into the hospitals by wounded soldiers from\r\nthe enemy’s camp, or else brought back by citizens who had been out to\r\ninspect the position of the besiegers. During the siege the surrounding\r\ncountry had been most terribly ravaged by the enemy’s soldiers, so that\r\nthe inhabitants were in the greatest misery, without food and without\r\nany source of help. For the spread of typhus fever this afforded a very\r\nfavourable soil, and it raged furiously in the months of June and July\r\nin the villages surrounding Metz.\r\n\r\nThe battles with the Turks in the east did a great deal toward spreading\r\ntyphus fever throughout Europe; for that reason the name ‘Hungarian\r\ndisease’ came into existence. Toward the end of the fifteenth century,\r\nhitherto prosperous Hungary, by endless wars with Turkey and by\r\ninternational strife, was brought to the very verge of ruin. Agriculture\r\nceased almost entirely, the development of the country came to a\r\nstandstill, large tracts of land, such as the Banat region, assumed the\r\nappearance of a vast swamp, while at the same time the alternate cold\r\nnights and hot days, together with the great dampness, were very\r\nunhealthy for the foreign soldiers, who were not accustomed to such a\r\nclimate. Partly this, and partly the utter lack of sanitation, increased\r\nthe baneful effects of camp-life. Dirt and refuse accumulated in heaps,\r\nvermin multiplied so rapidly that it was impossible to get rid of them,\r\ncorpses were inadequately buried, while enormous numbers of flies and\r\ngnats molested the soldiers and did a great deal toward spreading\r\ninfectious diseases. The hospitals were in a pitiable condition, and\r\nsince the soldiers, after their previous experiences, had little hope of\r\nleaving the country alive, they gave themselves over to a most dissolute\r\nlife, in consequence of which the country suffered terribly. Several\r\ncontemporaries bear witness to the fact that a large part of the German\r\ntroops never once faced the enemy, for the reason that they succumbed\r\nbeforehand to ‘Hungarian disease’, which killed more of them than the\r\nswords of the Turks. Hence Hungary was called at that time the ‘Cemetery\r\nof the Germans’.\r\n\r\n‘Hungarian disease’ was typhus fever, which manifested certain unusual\r\ncharacteristics for the reason that the German troops, being\r\nunaccustomed to the local foods, inclined considerably toward intestinal\r\ncatarrh and scurvy, while many of them also suffered from malaria, which\r\nweakened their power of resistance. The sudden beginning with a chill,\r\nthe appearance of lenticular spots on the fourth, fifth, or sixth day,\r\nthe duration of about fourteen days, the sudden fall of temperature—all\r\nthese symptoms, mentioned by witnesses, definitely stamp the disease as\r\ntyphus fever. If the disease has been identified by many historians with\r\nbubonic plague, the reason is that in serious cases of typhus fever\r\nsuppuration of the salivary glands, gangrene of the lower extremities,\r\nof the nose and ears, &c., are not infrequent occurrences.\r\n\r\nAccording to Györy,[24] the pestilence which raged so furiously in the\r\narmy of Joachim, Margrave of Brandenburg, when the latter was in Hungary\r\nin 1542, was typhus fever. He assumes that the disease was borne thither\r\nby the Italian troops which the Pope had sent to help fight against the\r\nTurks, although he cannot base his assumption on any argument save that\r\ntyphus fever was no rare disease in Italy. It is much more probable,\r\nhowever, that the disease was already endemic in Hungary at that time,\r\nwhether from of yore, or whether the Turks had brought it there. So\r\nmuch, however, is certain, that the Germans suffered a great deal more\r\nfrom it than did the Hungarians and Turks, who had probably already\r\nsurvived attacks of the disease and had thus become immune.\r\n\r\n‘Hungarian disease’ acquired greater importance in the year 1566, when\r\nit spread from Hungary over a large part of Europe. It was then that\r\nthis name first came into fashion. According to Thomas Jordanus, who\r\ntook part in the expedition, the disease broke out on the island of\r\nKomorn during the war of Maximilian II against the Turks; from there it\r\nspread further west and forced the Emperor to conclude a treaty of peace\r\nwhich favoured the Turks. After the dispersion of the army the\r\ndischarged soldiers carried the disease in all directions.[25] Vienna\r\nwas hit very hard; not only separate houses, but also entire streets,\r\nwere filled with victims of the disease. The returning Italians brought\r\nthe disease first to Carinthia, where it broke out severely in Villach,\r\nand then to Italy. In the year 1567 the pestilence carried away 400\r\npeople in the little town of Villach, and from there it spread to\r\nStyria. In the same way it was carried to Bohemia, Germany, Burgundy,\r\nBelgium, and Spain.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the sixteenth century typhus fever appeared in Hungary\r\nwith renewed virulence; during the siege of Papa it raged with\r\nparticular severity among the Italian troops, and according to Coberus\r\nall the patients in the field-hospital died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                         THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the seventeenth century, epidemics of bubonic plague\r\nand typhus fever were frequent occurrences in various parts of Central\r\nEurope, but they were usually kept localized by the strict measures that\r\nwere adopted, in accordance with the best scientific knowledge of the\r\ntime, to prevent them from spreading; the houses in which the patients\r\nlay were quarantined, strangers from infected places were forbidden to\r\nenter the cities under penalty of death, the clothes and beds used by\r\nthe patients were burned, while in the streets and public squares\r\nfumigations took place. But in the storm and stress of the Thirty Years’\r\nWar such precautions could be taken only to a limited extent, and even\r\nwhen they were energetically carried out, they did no good, since\r\ndiseases were so frequently borne from place to place. A further\r\nconsequence of the long war was famine, which was caused by the\r\ndevastation of the fields and the non-cultivation of the land, due to\r\nthe lack of workers. This made it easier for pestilences to become\r\nunusually widespread throughout Germany. The fact that the scene of the\r\nwar kept changing was also to a great extent responsible for the gradual\r\ndissemination of various diseases, since the regions in which the\r\nfighting was going on were always particularly exposed to pestilential\r\ndevastation.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we possess, for the various pestilences, scarcely any\r\naccounts written by physicians, and with a few exceptions must rely upon\r\nthe information given by chroniclers. In most cases, therefore, it is\r\nimpossible to state with certainty just what the individual diseases\r\nwere. Consequently, inasmuch as the word ‘plague’ is used in the\r\nchronicles for any serious pestilence, we have adopted it in this same\r\ngeneral sense in our account, without necessarily meaning thereby\r\nbubonic plague. Certainly one of the most common ‘war diseases’ at that\r\ntime was typhus fever, and diseases that were commonly called ‘burning,\r\nvirulent fever’, ‘plague’, ‘head-disease’, ‘Hungarian disease’, and\r\n‘Swedish disease’, were undoubtedly nothing else but that. At the same\r\ntime real plague, bubonic plague, now and then occurred, and the word\r\n‘plague’ is thus very often used in its proper sense, especially in\r\nreference to the pestilences of the years 1630–6. ‘In the history of\r\nthis calamitous war,’ says Seitz,[26] ‘we see typhus fever like a\r\nmalignant spectre hovering over the armies wherever they go, in their\r\ncamps, on their marches, and in their permanent quarters, and preparing\r\nan inglorious end for thousands of valiant warriors. Its ravages among\r\nthe non-belligerent population in town and country caused the\r\ninhabitants of many provinces to remember with hatred and loathing the\r\ndeparted soldiers, who were usually accused of having planted the seed\r\nof death.’\r\n\r\nIn general one may say that before 1630 the specific disease was usually\r\ntyphus fever, and that after 1630 bubonic plague spread along with this\r\ndisease throughout Germany; the death statistics of the larger cities,\r\nadduced at the end of this chapter, lead us to this conclusion. In\r\naddition to these two diseases, we find frequent mention of dysentery,\r\nscurvy, and, toward the end of the war, small-pox.\r\n\r\nInnumerable articles, chronicles, &c., have described in detail the\r\nmiserable condition of the German countries during the Thirty Years’\r\nWar. The following account is largely based upon a notable work by a\r\nphysician named Lammert, who offers us a chronological enumeration of\r\nthe pestilences of that time, and also an exhaustive bibliography.[27]\r\nSince it is impossible to discuss here thoroughly all the countless\r\nepidemics that occurred, we can merely point out their main features and\r\nindicate their connexion with warlike events. The figures quoted may be\r\nrelied upon, if, as is usually the case, they are taken from\r\nchurch-registers; as regards statements taken from chronicles, on the\r\nother hand, there is more occasion for distrust. For a correct\r\nunderstanding of the facts, to be sure, we should have to know the exact\r\npopulation of the cities and towns, and this information is only in rare\r\ninstances available. We must bear in mind, furthermore, that the\r\ncountry-people fled to the cities when armies were approaching, and also\r\nthat nearly all cities were surrounded by walls and embankments.\r\n\r\nThe war began in Bohemia. After the battle on White Hill, near Prague\r\n(November 8, 1620), the soldiers of Count Mansfeld, who were already\r\ninfected with typhus fever, marched down the Main to the Palatinate and\r\nto Alsace, devastating the country as they passed and leaving severe\r\npestilences behind them. In the year 1625 the main scene of the war was\r\ntransferred to the north, where numerous epidemics had already broken\r\nout in the course of that year. The disorder caused by the war, and\r\nespecially the wild warfare of Wallenstein, who in the fall of 1625,\r\nafter mustering his army, had joined forces with Tilly, were\r\nparticularly favourable to the spreading of disease. Hence in the years\r\n1625–6 we see precisely in North Germany the ‘plague’ doing the greatest\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Barenberg (near Lutter, August 1626) gave the Imperialists\r\nthe upper hand in North Germany. This ascendancy was taken away from\r\nthem, however, with the appearance of Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who\r\nwon a complete victory over Tilly in the battle of Breitenfeld\r\n(September 17, 1631). After that, Gustavus Adolphus advanced to the\r\nLower Main (Frankfurt and Mayence), and the following year carried the\r\nwar into Bavaria, which now became the principal scene of the fighting.\r\nAfter the battle of Nördlingen (September 7, 1634), the fugitive Swedish\r\nProtestant army, pursued by the Imperialists, retreated through\r\nWürttemberg, Baden, and Hesse to the Rhine, where the war was now\r\ncarried on for several years. Both armies were badly infected with\r\ndisease, and spread pestilence wherever they went. After the battle of\r\nNördlingen the war became decentralized, splitting up into a number of\r\nwarlike movements throughout all Germany; and everywhere these movements\r\noccurred they added, if possible, to the misery of the people.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1631 that terrible epoch of plague began which reached its\r\nclimax in the years 1634–5 and lasted well into the following year. Its\r\nwidespread character was due to the innumerable plundering and\r\ndevastating marches of the Protestant-Swedish and Imperialist-Catholic\r\narmies back and forth across the country, and also to the consequent\r\nfamine. Everything the brutalized soldiers could not consume themselves\r\nor take with them, they destroyed or burned. There was an absolute\r\ndearth of farm-workers, and in addition to that, the year 1635 was dry\r\nand unproductive. Horrible are the descriptions of the hunger and misery\r\nwhich the people in all parts of Germany experienced at that time. Under\r\nsuch conditions pestilences could spread unhindered; to be sure, they\r\nrelaxed a little after the year 1638, but by no means ceased entirely.\r\nWhenever real plague disappeared, typhus fever, which was prevalent in\r\nall parts of the army took its place; and thus diseases were borne from\r\nplace to place until the very end of that disastrous war.\r\n\r\n\r\n           I. THE WAR IN BOHEMIA AND THE PALATINATE (1618–24)\r\n\r\nThe year 1620 saw the first warlike events of any importance; at the\r\nbeginning they were confined to Bohemia, where in November 1619,\r\nFrederick, Elector of the Palatinate, had been crowned King of Bohemia.\r\nIn the first part of the year 1620 typhus fever broke out in Austria and\r\nBohemia among the poorly nourished troops of the Catholic League,\r\ncarrying away, it is said, 20,000 Bavarian soldiers. After the League’s\r\nsuccessful battle on White Hill (November 8, 1620), the disease was\r\nborne by Bavarian soldiers back to Upper Bavaria and Württemberg; it is\r\nstated that it caused an eruption of red spots over the entire body, and\r\nthat headache, dizziness, and stupefaction were prevailing symptoms.[28]\r\nMunich, by adopting strict measures of precaution—isolation of the\r\npatients in houses outside of the city, disinfection of suspected\r\neffects and incoming letters, washing in vinegar of money sent in from\r\ninfected localities—managed to exclude the disease from the city limits.\r\nIn 1620 the troops of Count Mansfeld conveyed the disease, which was\r\ncalled ‘head-disease’, to Franconia, where in the following year it\r\nraged extensively. In consequence of their marauding expeditions, typhus\r\nfever also became very widespread in the Upper Palatinate—Neumarkt and\r\nWeiden are mentioned as places where it appeared; in Weiden 250 persons\r\ndied, three or four times as many as in normal years. Count Mansfeld\r\nthen marched down the Main and along the Neckar to Mannheim, and\r\neverywhere his soldiers went they left behind them the germ of typhus\r\nfever: e.g. in Boxberg (near Mergentheim), in Neckarelz (near Mosbach),\r\nin Eberbach, in Ladenburg and Viernheim (both near Mannheim), and in\r\nmany other places.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Lorraine, the Palatinate, and northern Baden\r\nbecame the scenes of Count Mansfeld’s predatory incursions. Since the\r\ncountry-people fled to the cities, the latter became greatly\r\novercrowded; in Strassburg, for example, whither 23,000 country-people\r\nhad sought refuge, a severe pestilence (chiefly dysentery) broke out and\r\ncarried away in the course of that year (1622) 4,388 people.\r\n‘Headdisease’ broke out in Wimpfen-on-the-Neckar, after the battle\r\nfought there on May 6, in consequence of the arrival of over 900 hundred\r\nsick and wounded soldiers; the result was that a large proportion of the\r\ninhabitants were taken sick, and a third of them died. In the\r\nPalatinate, through which Mansfeld passed on one of his predatory raids,\r\nthe mortality in town and country, in consequence of dysentery and other\r\ndiseases, was very great. Again, in Frankfurt-on-the-Main typhus fever\r\nbroke out in 1622, and 1,785 people died (as compared with 600–700 in\r\nnormal years). In Mayence and vicinity the disease became very\r\nwidespread in the year 1624. A plague also broke out in Nuremberg in\r\nOctober 1624, carrying away 2,487 people that year, and 2,881 the\r\nfollowing year.\r\n\r\nThe Palatinate suffered terribly in the year 1623 from the continued\r\nmarauding of Mansfeld’s army, and in consequence of cross-marches of\r\nSpanish and Walloon troops pestilential diseases were conveyed from\r\nthere to Lorraine. In July 1623, according to Maréchal and Didion,[29]\r\ntyphus fever or bubonic plague broke out in the village of Lessy and\r\nraged furiously for two months. Despite energetic measures that were\r\ntaken to prevent the disease from spreading, neighbouring and even more\r\nor less remote villages were infected, so that in 1624 the entire\r\ncountry was suffering. In spite of the fact that all strangers were\r\nforbidden to enter the city of Metz under penalty of death, the disease\r\nmade its appearance there in May 1625, and in less than ten months\r\ncarried away 3,000 people. Of the cities surrounding Metz, all of which\r\nwere infected, Verdun had a particularly high mortality. The epidemic\r\nspread from the Palatinate to Württemberg, Baden, Hanau, Nassau, and\r\ndown the Rhine; for the most part it was typhus fever.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1623 the army of the Catholic League spread infectious\r\ndiseases throughout Hesse, particularly in the region of the Werra. When\r\nthe army withdrew, it left dysentery behind it, for example, in\r\nWitzenhausen, Eschwege, and Hersfeld; in July and August it carried away\r\nmany victims. A pestilential disease broke out on June 3, 1624, in\r\nHersfeld, carrying away from October 4, 1624, to January 1625, 316\r\npersons. In 1625, ‘hunger typhus’ and bubonic plague appeared in Nassau;\r\nthe pestilence began in Dillenburg on December 18, 1625, and lasted\r\nuntil October 30, 1626, carrying away in this time 378 people—about\r\none-third of the population. The climax of the pestilence came in July.\r\nA plague also broke out among the soldiers in Walsdorf-on-the Ems,\r\nlikewise in Idstein, remaining there for several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n II. THE WAR IN SAXONY, THURINGIA, BRANDENBURG, AND POMERANIA (1625–30)\r\n\r\nThe years 1625 and 1626 were bad pest-years; according to Lammert, the\r\nvarious epidemics that occurred were partly typhus fever, partly bubonic\r\nplague, and partly dysentery. The pestilences spread over Saxony,\r\nThuringia, Silesia, Eastern Prussia, Posen, Poland, and Moravia, and\r\ncarried away large numbers of people. They were not always directly\r\nconnected with warlike events, as shown by the fact that many provinces\r\nthat were spared by the war were attacked by the diseases. On the other\r\nhand, the incursion of Wallenstein’s troops into Saxony and Thuringia\r\ncaused pestilence to become unusually widespread.\r\n\r\nFrom 1625 to the time of the battle of Breitenfeld (1631) Saxony\r\nsuffered terribly from pestilences that were caused and prolonged by the\r\nwar, though by no means as terribly as in the years 1631–3. Dresden and\r\nLeipzig, comparatively speaking, were but slightly affected. Of 13,000\r\ninhabitants that Dresden had in the year 1626, 341 succumbed to a plague\r\nwhich began in April and disappeared in December; the disease was called\r\n‘burning fever’, ‘spotted fever’, and ‘pestilential spotted fever’,\r\nwhile in the records of the town council we find mention of ‘spots,\r\noften the size of a groschen, all over the body’, and also of\r\n‘swellings’. Inasmuch as abscesses and gangrene are often observed in\r\ncases of typhus fever, it seems likely that it was that disease.[30] Of\r\n14,500 inhabitants in Leipzig only 122 succumbed to it, although houses\r\nin all the streets were infected. Here again, accordingly, we see how\r\nslight the danger to life is in the case of typhus fever.\r\n\r\nThe western part of the present kingdom of Saxony suffered considerably\r\nmore than the eastern part. In the year 1625 plagues broke out in the\r\ncities of Plauen, Reichenbach (1,000 deaths), and Zwickau; the\r\nlast-named city was revisited in June 1626, and between then and the end\r\nof the year 216 people died there. Pestilence also broke out in the\r\nvicinity of Leipzig in 1626—in Borna (70 deaths), in Grimma (350\r\ndeaths), and in Wurzen, where it appeared in August. The following\r\nplaces nearer Dresden were also the scenes of plagues that year:\r\nRosswein (near Döbeln—376 deaths), Mitweida (outbreak on April 9,\r\n1626—number of deaths before that day 22, between that day and the end\r\nof the year, 1,000), Frankenberg (581 deaths), Freiberg (752 deaths in\r\nthe year 1626—500 of them due to the plague). The village of Dohna,\r\nsouth of Dresden, is also mentioned; in the year 1626 there were 157\r\ndeaths there, as compared with an average annual mortality of 60. In the\r\nErzgebirge plagues appeared in various places in the year 1625; 134\r\npeople died in Annaberg and 323 people in Zöblitz. In 1626 there were\r\n205 deaths in Schwarzenberg, 178 deaths in Gottesgabe, and 81 deaths in\r\nBreitenbrunn. Two towns in eastern Saxony, Bischofswerda and Zittau, are\r\nalso mentioned; there were 182 deaths in the former in the year 1625.\r\n\r\nAll Thuringia suffered severely from pestilences in the years 1625–6. In\r\nthe year 1625 the number of deaths in Eisenach had increased to 315,\r\nwhile in 1626 a plague raged so murderously that 769 persons succumbed\r\nto it; other reports say 2,500, but this number doubtless includes the\r\nrefugees. In the following year the number of deaths decreased to 156.\r\nIn Ruhla, a neighbouring village, 98 persons succumbed to the plague. In\r\nmany Thuringian cities the epidemic had already secured a foothold in\r\nthe year 1625, and was then spread over a very large territory by\r\nWallenstein’s invasion. Schmalkalden was the scene of a plague from June\r\nto August, 1625, and in Gotha one broke out at the end of July, 1625,\r\ncarrying away 722 persons that year and 209 the following year. In\r\nErfurt, which had some 15,000 inhabitants, 3,474 people are said to have\r\nsuccumbed to a plague in the year 1626, the strict ordinances passed by\r\nthe town council on December 25, 1625, being of no avail. The small\r\ncommunities and cities lying to the north of Erfurt, according to the\r\nreports, were very severely attacked; in the year 1625 Ballstädt, with a\r\npopulation of 600, lost 365, while in the year 1626 the number of deaths\r\nin Gräfentonna was 510, in Gebesee 275, in Kindelbrück 1,514, in\r\nStraussfurth 367, in Weissensee 500, and Cölleda 1,000. In the region\r\nsouth of Erfurt the village of Ohrdruf lost 203 inhabitants in the year\r\n1625, and 143 in the following year. In Arnstadt 1,236 people succumbed\r\nin 1625 to ‘head-disease’ and bubonic plague—a number corresponding to\r\none-quarter of the population. Gräfenroda had 1,630 deaths in the year\r\n1625, and Tambach 400 deaths in 1626. Koburg and Rudolstadt were also\r\nvisited by a plague in 1626, while towns in the vicinity of the latter,\r\nKönigssee, Schwarza, Tanna, and Schleiz, had 707, 129, 195, and 181\r\ndeaths respectively. The neighbouring town of Pössnek in the year 1625\r\nhad already lost 1,000 inhabitants. Jena and Weimar both suffered, while\r\nthere were 228 deaths in Gera and 1,100 deaths in Zeitz due to\r\npestilence. Many other places in Thuringia that suffered from plagues\r\nare not mentioned here.\r\n\r\nThat part of Saxony which corresponds to the modern province of Saxony\r\nfared in much the same way as Thuringia, while those parts bordering\r\ndirectly on the kingdom of Saxony were relatively less severely\r\nattacked. A plague broke out in Eilenburg in September 1625, and\r\ncarried away many persons there and in the surrounding country. At\r\nDelitsch (west of Eilenburg) a dangerous fever (_febris\r\nmaligna_—probably typhus fever) spread through the wandering armies,\r\nand before the beginning of autumn carried away 150 persons. In the\r\nwinter the disease subsided a little, but broke out again in June\r\n1626, and carried away 880 people—in September alone there were 229\r\ndeaths, and numerous families were completely wiped out. A plague also\r\nraged in the vicinity of Halle; not until the following year, however,\r\ndid it break out in the city itself, whither it was borne by\r\nImperialist soldiers, and where it caused, from June to December,\r\n3,400 deaths. In Eisleben (east of Halle) a plague began in May 1626,\r\nand carried away 30 to 50 people daily, so that the total number of\r\ndeaths for the year was 3,068. Merseburg lost 341 inhabitants in the\r\nyear 1626, and a plague raged in Naumburg in the years 1625–6. The\r\ntown of Querfurt (west of Merseburg) in 1625 was for seven weeks the\r\nquarters of 3,000 of Wallenstein’s soldiers; they brought dysentery\r\nwith them, and the result was that 200 citizens died. In the second\r\nhalf of the following year a plague broke out and carried away 1,400\r\ninhabitants of the city (including 200 soldiers) and numerous\r\ninhabitants of the surrounding country. The town and vicinity of\r\nSangershausen were also severely attacked; the pestilence began in the\r\ntown in June 1626, and reached its climax in September with 570\r\ndeaths—1,323 deaths, all told, are recorded in the church register for\r\nthat year, but the figure is said to be too small. Lammert mentions\r\nsixteen surrounding villages in which a total of 2,960 deaths occurred\r\nin the year 1626. In Sondershausen 54 people died up to the end of\r\nJuly of that year, 36 in August, 137 in September, and 143 in October;\r\nthe mortality then decreased, but not until 466 persons had died, 400\r\nof them in consequence of the plague. In the near-by towns of\r\nFrankenhausen and Langensalza the number of deaths was 915 and 913\r\nrespectively, the latter town having been visited by a plague the year\r\nbefore. Nordhausen, from January 1, 1626, to December 6, 1626, lost\r\n3,283 inhabitants—2,504 natives and 779 refugees from other places. In\r\nStolberg (north-east of Nordhausen) a plague broke out on June 27,\r\n1626, and caused 623 deaths. Quedlinburg, Aschersleben, and\r\nHalberstadt were also attacked; in Aschersleben a plague broke out on\r\nJune 15, 1625, and between then and the end of the year carried away\r\n157 persons. The total number of deaths in the year 1625 was 534, in\r\nthe following year 1,800 (1,066 in consequence of the plague), not\r\nincluding the soldiers; the years 1627–9 had a remarkably low\r\nmortality. In 1626 a plague carried away 549 persons in Gröningen\r\n(near Halberstadt). The cities on the Elbe and the surrounding country\r\nwere severely attacked; a pestilence broke out in Dessau on September\r\n3, 1625, and between then and the end of the year 224 persons were\r\nburied—399 in the entire year. The disease reappeared in the summer of\r\nthe following year, having caused 662 deaths, while only 39 died in\r\nthe year following. In Aiken-on-the-Elbe (below Dessau) 1,000 persons,\r\nincluding soldiers, succumbed to a plague in the year 1626. In the\r\ncities on the Saale, above its confluence with the Elbe, a plague\r\nraged furiously; in Bernburg it appeared in the second half of the\r\nyear 1625, carrying away 1,340 persons in that year (the number of\r\ndeaths in the following year being 425); Kalbe was also severely\r\nattacked. A plague broke out in Magdeburg at the end of June 1625, and\r\nlasted well into the next year; the wealthy citizens fled from the\r\ncity, but were compelled to return by the approach of the\r\nImperialists, and the result was that several thousand inhabitants\r\ndied. The country to the south-west of Magdeburg, as far as Bode,\r\nsuffered severely—Osterweddingen, Wanzleben, Gross-Salze, Förderstedt,\r\nEgeln, Wolmirsleben, and other places. Several soldiers quartered in\r\nFörderstedt had succumbed to a plague in June and July 1626, and had\r\ninfected the citizens with the disease, which carried away 155 of\r\nthem. A plague broke out in Egeln in October 1625, and reached its\r\nclimax in February 1626; from January until August 16 of that year 296\r\npersons died there. In Unseberg, which had been infected in August\r\n1625, some 400 citizens and soldiers were buried in the year 1626, in\r\naddition to many who were secretly buried in gardens, thickets, and\r\nfields. The plague raged with particular fury in August 1626; in\r\nVolmirstadt 246 persons died between July 6 and October 1626—144 in\r\nSeptember alone.\r\n\r\nIn Lower Saxony, in the region between the Elbe and the Weser, most of\r\nwhich to-day belongs to Hanover, a plague raged virulently in the years\r\n1625–7. In Osterode, whither numerous country people had fled from the\r\napproaching war, a very severe pestilence broke out; in the Saint\r\nAegidius community alone 1,500 persons died, among them many outsiders.\r\nIn Klausthal 1,350, in Andreasberg 700, in Einbeck 3,000, and in Hameln\r\n1,143 people succumbed to bubonic plague and ‘head disease’. In Goslar,\r\nwhere the pestilence had appeared in 1625, conditions were rendered\r\nparticularly bad by the fact that many wounded Imperialists were brought\r\nthere after the battle of Barenberg (near Lutter—August 27, 1626); most\r\nof these soldiers died there, 3,000 deaths due to pestilence having\r\noccurred in Goslar in the years 1625–6. Wallenstein’s soldiers also\r\nbrought pestilence with them to Helmstedt (in the region of Brunswick);\r\nhere one-third of the citizens died, and 295 houses were rendered\r\ntenantless. The university faculty fled several times to Brunswick, the\r\nstudents either going home or enlisting in the army. This plague did not\r\ncome to an end for two years. The surrounding villages, furthermore,\r\nwere severely attacked by it; during the siege of Göttingen by Tilly\r\n(June to August 12, 1626) it became very widespread, since the city was\r\novercrowded with fugitives. From 50 to 60 persons were buried every day.\r\nIn near-by Dransfeld 700 people died, in Wolfenbüttel 1,705. In Hanover,\r\nwhere a plague had already broken out in the year 1625, a reappearance\r\nof it in March 1626 drove out the garrison. The severity of this plague,\r\nwhich carried away 3,000 people, was increased by the numerous fugitives\r\nin the city; about one-third of the population survived. In the city of\r\nNienburg, which was besieged by the Imperialists after the battle of\r\nBarenberg, a pestilence likewise broke out among the inhabitants and in\r\nthe garrison. In Lüneburg it lasted from 1625 to 1628, and in Osnabrück\r\nfrom August 1625 to the end of the year.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1625–6 Wallenstein’s soldiers carried pestilence into the\r\nregion north of Magdeburg; in Neuhaldensleben 76 persons were carried\r\naway between the end of August and the first of the year, not including\r\nthose who were buried secretly. The following year it demanded a\r\nconsiderably larger number of victims—583; the maximum was in June—147.\r\nIn the Altmark (north-eastern part of the province of Saxony) dysentery,\r\nbubonic plague, and typhus fever broke out almost everywhere during the\r\nyears 1625–8. Dysentery appeared in the Danish garrison at Tangermünde\r\nand carried away 1,600 people, and on June 29, 1626, the Danes withdrew\r\nfrom the place. Stendal was also visited by a plague after the departure\r\nof the Danes; it broke out in July, and in a few months caused 2,511\r\ndeaths, the normal mortality being 280–290. Numerous bodies were\r\nsecretly buried, while many peasants who had fled to the city were among\r\nthe dead; thus the total number of deaths was estimated at 5,000. In\r\nOsterburg 624 people died in the years 1626–8, and in Bismark 163\r\npersons died in the year 1626. In the city of Havelberg 668 persons\r\nsuccumbed to dysentery, ‘head-disease’, and bubonic plague, the latter\r\nalone carrying away about 400. A pestilence was conveyed to Gardenlegen\r\nby the soldiers of Count George of Brunswick, who had his head-quarters\r\nthere; the number of deaths there in the year 1626 amounted to no less\r\nthan 1,514. In Salzwedel 335 persons died in the year 1625, and 451 in\r\nthe following year, the plague being responsible for 400 of the latter.\r\nIn Seehausen dysentery first appeared, and soon gave way to ‘war-plague’\r\n(typhus fever), which lasted until 1628; some 200 of the soldiers\r\nquartered there died, and as many as 1,100 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nBrandenburg also suffered, particularly in the south-eastern part, when\r\nWallenstein’s army, in pursuit of Count Mansfeld, turned into Silesia;\r\nthere were 386 deaths in Luckau, 900 in Kottbus, 500 in Forst, 112 in\r\nSpremberg, and 902 in Jüterbog.\r\n\r\nFurther north, plagues were considerably less widespread in the years\r\n1625–6. In 1625 typhus fever broke out severely in Lübeck and the\r\nsurrounding country, carrying away 6,952 people, while in Bremen, which\r\nhad had cases of plague in 1625, a widespread outbreak in 1627 carried\r\naway some 10,000 people, natives and refugees. Mecklenburg, being\r\nfurther away from the scene of the war, suffered somewhat less. In the\r\nyear 1625 bubonic plague, ‘head-disease’, and dysentery appeared in\r\nRostock, Wismar, Schwerin, Plau, and New Brandenburg. In the following\r\nyear a plague broke out in Parchim, reached its climax in May, and\r\nlasted until November, carrying away 1,600 persons. In Flensburg a\r\nplague broke out during the occupation of the Imperialists (1627) and\r\nlasted until their departure (1630).\r\n\r\nThe pestilences of the year 1627 were not very widespread, and this\r\napplies also to the territory in Saxony and Thuringia which had suffered\r\nso severely in the years 1625–6. On the other hand, the countries in the\r\nnorthern part of Germany, particularly Pomerania and Schleswig-Holstein,\r\nwere severely attacked in those years, owing to the fact that\r\nWallenstein had transferred thither the scene of the war. In the year\r\n1628 Hamburg had taken in a great many foreign fugitives, and the result\r\nwas that typhus fever soon broke out in the city and carried away many\r\nthousands of people. The war brought great misery into North Friesland\r\nand the Frisian Islands; the Imperialists and Danes oppressed the people\r\nby enforced quartering and extortions of all kinds, and the result was\r\nfamine and plague, lasting until 1630. In Stade, which Tilly in 1629 had\r\nmade his head-quarters, both the inhabitants and the garrison suffered\r\nterribly from a severe epidemic of dysentery. In the city of Schleswig a\r\nplague broke out in September, and again in November, in consequence of\r\nthe quartering of Imperialist troops; it devastated the entire city, so\r\nthat 211 houses stood absolutely empty on Christmas Day, 1628.\r\nMecklenburg was revisited in 1629, and on August 13 of that year a\r\nplague broke out in Rostock and Teterow. Imperialist soldiers conveyed\r\npestilence to the city of Plau, where they passed the night of November\r\n29; but in 1630 it appeared in a much more severe form there and carried\r\naway 600 people. In the year 1630 a plague broke out in Mecklenburg, and\r\nin Gustrow one raged from May 7 to the beginning of September.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1628–9 Pomerania was ravaged by the Imperialists, with\r\nresulting pestilence and famine. Greifswald suffered for four years from\r\na pestilence which reached its climax in the year 1631. Grimmen,\r\nStargard (3,500 deaths in the years 1627–30), Freienwalde, and other\r\nplaces were also attacked. In Greifenberg, where soldiers had been\r\nquartered in large numbers, it raged with unusual fury; three-fourths of\r\nthe city were devastated, and when the Swedes arrived only 42 houses\r\nwere uninfected. Kolberg (on the Persante) in six months lost 3,000\r\ninhabitants in consequence of a pestilence. On account of the oppression\r\ncaused by the war, many citizens fled from Koslin, which, despite the\r\ndecrease in population, lost 919 inhabitants in the year 1630. In Stolp\r\n800 people died in consequence of a plague.\r\n\r\nA plague was borne into Silesia in July 1623, and in Bunzlau an average\r\nof thirty persons per week died; of 760 deaths in the year, 640 were due\r\nto the pestilence. Many adults fled to near-by villages and died there.\r\nIn the following year a plague broke out again in Bunzlau, but as only\r\n130 people died there in 1625, it seemed as though the pestilence was\r\nover. In September and October, 1626, however, it broke out again, and\r\nof 228 deaths that occurred that year, 149 were directly attributable to\r\nthe plague. In July 1624 it appeared in Friedeberg and carried away 51\r\npersons. In Löwenberg it began in September 1624; the citizens fled from\r\nthe city and set up tents in the fields, but in spite of this, from\r\nforty to fifty people died every day, and the total number of deaths for\r\nthe year was some 3,000. In the year 1625 the pestilence was very\r\nwidespread in Silesia—Hirschberg, Löwenberg, Herzogswaldau, Liegnitz,\r\nNeumarkt, Waldenburg, Neisse, and other places were attacked. In Breslau\r\n‘head-disease’ raged from June to the end of that year, carrying away\r\n3,000 people; 1626 was also a year of pestilence for Breslau. In\r\nNeustadt (Governmental District of Oppeln) a pestilence raged with\r\nparticular fury from May till September 1625; for the years 1624 to 1627\r\nthe deaths were respectively 198, 420, 175, and 472. On August 21, 1626,\r\nan army of 6,000 Imperialists under Count von Merode encamped at\r\nGoldberg; most of them were infected with disease; and after their\r\ndeparture a plague broke out with such severity that a large part of the\r\npopulation died.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, from 1625 to 1630, when epidemics were raging almost\r\neverywhere in North Germany, South Germany also suffered, since diseases\r\nwere often brought there by Imperialist troops and wandering rabble. In\r\nthe year 1626 Württemberg alone lost 28,000 people in consequence of\r\nplagues.[31] A pestilence in Augsburg (1628) became very widespread and\r\ncaused 9,000 deaths. In the year 1629 ‘head-disease’ broke out in\r\nWürttemberg and Alsace. During the isolation of the city of Hanau (from\r\nDecember 6, 1629, to March 12, 1630) by the Imperialist commander\r\nWitzleben, a pestilential disease, which the soldiers had brought with\r\nthem, broke out and caused many deaths throughout the entire vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       III. THE WAR YEARS 1630–40\r\n\r\n\r\n              1. _North Germany until the Peace of Prague_\r\n\r\nIn the year 1630 began in Saxony—in the wake of marching troops—that\r\ndeadly pestilence which soon spread over all Germany and was chiefly\r\nresponsible for the enormous loss of human life there in the course of\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War. We may safely assume that bubonic plague was the\r\nmost common disease, although both typhus fever and dysentery were of\r\nfrequent occurrence. In the years 1630–1 the pestilence was confined for\r\nthe most part to North Germany; the Electorate of Saxony suffered the\r\nworst, 934,000 people, according to the reports, having died there in\r\nconsequence of the war and of diseases.[32]\r\n\r\nThe pestilence broke out in Leipzig in October 1630, and carried away\r\n301 persons; it was borne there presumably by two foreign\r\norange-pedlars. In October of the following year it broke out again,\r\nwhen the Imperialists, after besieging the city for several weeks, on\r\nSeptember 13 had finally captured it. The number of deaths in the entire\r\nyear was 1,754. In the year 1632 Leipzig was once more the scene of\r\ngrave warlike events, and was compelled to live through a second siege\r\nby Wallenstein; the plague began in June, became very widespread in\r\nAugust, and from then till October caused a great many deaths, the total\r\nnumber for the year amounting to 1,390. In August 1633, Leipzig was\r\nagain besieged, and this likewise caused the outbreak of a plague which\r\nlasted until December and carried away 761 persons; in 1634 it was\r\napparently over, for of 306 deaths that are recorded for that year, only\r\n24 were attributable to the plague. In the years 1636–7, however, it\r\nreappeared with great severity throughout the entire city. The country\r\nsurrounding Leipzig suffered a great deal in the year 1633, which was\r\nthe worst plague-year that Saxony passed through. In the year 1632\r\nAltenburg was occupied by the Swedes, who were infected with some\r\npestilential disease, the germ of which they left behind them when they\r\nwithdrew on January 13, 1633. The disease spread rapidly, acquired a\r\nvirulent character, and carried away 2,104 persons, among them many\r\nforeign refugees. Grimma and Borna were severely attacked in 1633, while\r\nWurzen suffered less severely.\r\n\r\nThe country north-east of Leipzig suffered severely from plagues in\r\n1631. After the battle of Breitenfeld (September 15, 1631) most of the\r\nwounded were brought to Eilenburg, where in a few weeks a plague broke\r\nout and spread so rapidly that 300 people died in the month of October\r\nalone. After an abatement during the winter, it recommenced in 1632; the\r\nnumber of deaths for that year was 670, although only 492 of them were\r\ndue to the plague, while the disease did not entirely disappear until\r\n1636. The city of Belgern, after it was plundered by Holk’s troops on\r\nOctober 1, 1632, was visited by a plague; also Dommitsch, Oschatz (where\r\n563 deaths occurred in 1631, and many more in 1633–4), and Ortrand\r\n(where there were 800 deaths in the years 1631–3). Plagues raged very\r\nfrequently in Leisnig, Colditz, and Mittweida, and in the villages and\r\ntowns surrounding them. In February 1631, Palatinate, Imperialist, and\r\nLeague troops quartered in Leisnig, and the result was that\r\n‘head-disease’ and bubonic plague became very widespread; in the\r\nfollowing year they reappeared, causing 443 deaths, while many thousands\r\nare said to have died in the country districts. The same was true of the\r\nyear 1633. A pestilence broke out in Colditz in the year 1631, and in\r\nthe following year ‘soldier’s disease’ (typhus fever) was brought there\r\nby Swedish troops, while in 1633 bubonic plague caused 567 deaths.\r\nMittweida suffered from plague in the years 1631–4, 243 persons dying\r\nthere in the year 1634. In the year 1630 a very severe plague broke out\r\nin Freiberg; 1,147 people died in the course of the year, 1,000 of them\r\nin consequence of the disease. In the following year there were 124 more\r\ndeaths. In the autumn of 1632 pestilence raged so furiously that several\r\nthousand people died in a short time—about one-third of the population.\r\nMost of the bodies were buried secretly, only about 3,000 regular\r\nfunerals taking place. In the year 1633 there were 1,632 interments, not\r\nincluding those buried in secret. The plague affected the entire\r\nvicinity of Freiberg and spared scarcely a single village; many places\r\nwere left empty and deserted.\r\n\r\nIn Chemnitz 1,234 interments for the year 1632 are recorded in the\r\nchurch register, and in the following year the plague raged even more\r\nfuriously: almost every house was attacked, and the number of deaths\r\namounted to 2,500. In Glauchau and vicinity, as in all Saxony, 1633 was\r\nthe worst year; 964 people died there in that year. The plague raged\r\nmost furiously from August to November, and lasted until 1634; many\r\nbodies were found in the open fields. In the neighbouring Waldenburg 392\r\npeople died in a few weeks in 1633, in Lichtenstein 370, in Thurm 400.\r\nIn Marienberg, a village lying at the foot of the mountains, 1,000\r\npeople succumbed in the year 1633 to typhus fever; the plague spread\r\ninto the Erzgebirge and caused 2,300 deaths in Schneeberg and 157 deaths\r\nin the adjacent Neustädtle. A plague had already broken out in Zwickau\r\nin 1632, and in the first part of 1633 it became so severe that 1,500\r\npeople died in two months in the summer of that year. The city was full\r\nof sick people and dead bodies, and the number of reported deaths for\r\nthe year 1633 was 1,897; but the total number of deaths, excluding the\r\nsoldiers, is said to have been no less than 6,000. Entire streets were\r\ndevastated. Many of the inhabitants fled to near-by villages, and thus\r\nspread the infection. Crimmitschau was visited by a plague in 1630 (601\r\ndeaths), and again in 1633 (409 deaths); 92 families in the last-named\r\nyear were completely wiped out. Many neighbouring places were also\r\nattacked; there were 700 deaths in Werdau, 300 in Steinpleiss, 150 in\r\nKönigswalde, &c.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of Holk caused Vogtland to suffer terribly in August of the\r\nyear 1632, while his second invasion in the summer of 1633 resulted in\r\nan even worse outbreak of disease. In Reichenbach and vicinity, typhus\r\nfever, bubonic plague, and dysentery prevailed in the year 1633; at\r\nfirst it was called ‘soldier’s disease’, and later ‘bright plague’\r\n(_helle Pest_). Of 904 deaths that occurred that year, 785 were due to\r\nthe plague. In Plauen the number of deaths in 1633 was 1,748, in\r\nOelsnitz 325 (217 due to the plague). Holk himself succumbed to the\r\nplague in Adorf on August 30, 1633, while 1,000 of his troops also died.\r\n\r\nThe eastern part of Saxony was also attacked. In Dresden a plague broke\r\nout in 1632 and carried away numerous people; it continued to rage in\r\nthe following year, since the war prevented the adoption of the usual\r\nmeasures of precaution. In the year 1632 the number of Protestants\r\nburied by the church was 3,129, and in the following year it was 4,585.\r\nNumerous families were wiped out, and many houses were rendered\r\ntenantless. In the year 1634 one half of the inhabitants fell victims to\r\nthe pestilence, while a large part of the city was devastated in 1635.\r\nSince the reports of E. J. J. Meyer and of the town council continually\r\nspeak of ‘swellings’, the disease was no doubt bubonic plague.[33] In\r\nDippoldiswalde (south-west of Dresden) it raged so furiously in the\r\nyears 1631–3 that entire families were wiped out; in those years there\r\nwere 189, 510, and 250 deaths respectively. Pirna is said to have lost\r\n4,000 inhabitants in consequence of the plague in the years 1632–4,\r\nwhile Dittersdorf (south of Pirna) lost 405 inhabitants in the year\r\n1632. The pestilence was borne by Saxon troops to Sebnitz (south-east of\r\nDresden). In Stolpen it raged from 1632 to 1634. In October 1631 the\r\nCroats brought pestilence to Bischofswerda, and more than 200 persons\r\ndied in consequence of it. In March 1632 another pestilence broke out\r\nthere, carrying away 660 persons, so that more than one-third of the\r\nhouses stood empty. In the year 1631 there were 1,000 deaths in Camenz.\r\nIn Bautzen there was a garrison of 500 men, almost all of whom died in\r\nthe year 1631; including the residents that were carried away by the\r\npestilence, the number of deaths there for that year was about 1,000.\r\nNor did the pestilence disappear from Bautzen the following year.\r\n\r\nLusatia was also the scene of pestilence; only a few places were spared,\r\nand in Upper Lusatia 40,000 persons are said to have been carried away\r\nby pestilences in the years 1631–3. In the last part of September 1631,\r\ndysentery and bubonic plague broke out in Görlitz, which had a Saxon\r\ngarrison, and carried away some 400 persons (excluding the soldiers)\r\nbetween then and the end of the year. In June 1632 there was a second\r\noutbreak of plague; it reached its climax in October, and carried away\r\n6,105 people (including 106 soldiers) in the course of the entire year.\r\nIn the following year 726 inhabitants and 435 soldiers succumbed to the\r\ndisease. Zittau suffered severely; as early as 1633 several hundred\r\nsoldiers and inhabitants succumbed to typhus fever, while in the year\r\n1632 ‘burning fever’, dysentery, and bubonic plague appeared and carried\r\naway 1,246 persons (according to other reports, 1,642 persons).\r\nPetechial fever and bubonic plague, after a period of inactivity in the\r\nwinter, recommenced in the first part of 1633; the latter disease\r\nreached its climax in September, carrying away 1,860 inhabitants in that\r\nyear, in addition to many Imperialist soldiers. From October to\r\nDecember, 1634, Saxon and Brandenburg soldiers, after their return from\r\nBohemia, encamped near Zittau, where various diseases soon broke out;\r\nthe result was that hundreds died, and the entire region became\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\nThe Province of Brandenburg was severely attacked by a plague in the\r\nyear 1631, but in the next year suffered considerably less owing to the\r\nfact that the scene of the war was transferred to other parts of\r\nGermany. In Berlin 777 people succumbed to a plague in the year 1630,\r\nwhile in the following year it reappeared in a much severer form and\r\ncarried away 2,066 persons. In Spandau, after the capture of the city by\r\nthe Swedes on May 6, 1631, famine and pestilence broke out and caused\r\n1,500 deaths. A plague in Potsdam caused 457 deaths between June and\r\nDecember, 1631. Neuruppin, in February of that year, after the\r\noccupation of the District of Ruppin by Tilly, suffered from a severe\r\npestilence. Dysentery and ‘head-disease’ broke out in Rathenow in 1631,\r\nreached a climax in July, and carried away 662 people (not including\r\nthose buried in secret). In Prenzlau 1,500 persons, about one-fourth of\r\nthe population, died in the year 1631, while Havelberg had 227 deaths,\r\nLindow 400, and Kyritz (after the soldiers had quartered there) 231.\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Oder, which had been occupied by the Imperialists, on\r\nApril 13, 1631, was captured by Gustavus Adolphus, whereupon a severe\r\nepidemic broke out and carried away entire families in the course of a\r\nfew days; the alleged number of deaths was 6,000. Müncheberg (north-west\r\nof Frankfurt), Quilitz, Drossen, and Guben were also attacked; there\r\nwere 365 deaths in Quilitz and 2,000 in Drossen. In the year 1634, when\r\nthe Imperialists once more devastated the Electorate of Saxony, a severe\r\nplague broke out in Luckau, whither many country people had fled; the\r\nspread of the disease is said to have been favoured by the fact that the\r\nsoldiers broke into and robbed the closed houses of the dead. In\r\nSeftenberg (near Kalau) a plague broke out in 1630 and carried away 305\r\npersons that year; it remained there until 1633, and spread to many\r\nnear-by villages.\r\n\r\nSilesia, after the devastation caused by the pestilences of the years\r\n1624–7, had a few years of rest. In the year 1632, however, infection\r\nwas brought there from Saxony, though only to a limited extent. On\r\nAugust 1, 1632, Lauban was obliged to surrender to the Saxon garrison,\r\nso that for ten days the city and the surrounding country were crowded\r\nwith troops; the result was that after their departure a severe epidemic\r\nbroke out and between July and December carried away 1,400 persons. In\r\nthe very next year severe plagues broke out all over Silesia, when\r\nWallenstein appeared there for the purpose of driving out the Saxons and\r\nSwedes. The plague raged so furiously in Silesia that the armies were\r\nalmost entirely exterminated, and whole communities were wiped out.\r\nGolgau, Bunzlau (and vicinity), Greiffenberg, and Friedeberg were\r\nattacked. An epidemic of typhus fever carried away 500 people in\r\nHirschberg in the year 1632, and in the following year it became much\r\nmore widespread and carried away 2,600 persons. ‘The infected persons\r\nare said to have looked very red, like drunkards, and to have died\r\nsuddenly.’ Almost the entire population of Landshut died in the year\r\n1633. Goldberg (south-west of Liegnitz) had been plundered by\r\nWallenstein’s soldiers on October 4 and 5, 1633, and on October 10\r\nColonel Sparre quartered 200 ‘badly infected’ soldiers there; the result\r\nwas that a severe pestilence broke out in the city. In August of the\r\nyear 1633 such a severe pestilence broke out in Liegnitz that it was\r\nimpossible to bury the victims in the regular way; deep, broad ditches\r\nwere dug, and from 100 to 200 bodies laid in them. From August 14 to\r\nDecember 22 the number of deaths is said to have been 5,794. Breslau,\r\nwhich at that time had upwards of 40,000 inhabitants, was visited by a\r\nplague in September 1633; in the Protestant parishes 13,231 people died\r\nin that year, in the Catholic 4,800. Neumarkt (north-west of Breslau)\r\nhad 1,400 deaths in the same year, while in Brieg, which had a Swedish\r\ngarrison, there were 3,439 deaths. The city of Schweidnitz suffered\r\nterribly; 30,000 soldiers under Wallenstein and 25,000 Swedish soldiers\r\nwere encamped there, and the plague was so severe that 8,000 of the\r\nformer and 12,000 of the latter are said to have died. In the city\r\nitself, which was harbouring innumerable fugitives from the surrounding\r\ncountry, sick people and dead bodies soon filled all the streets; on\r\nAugust 25 alone, 300 people died. The number of the dead, including from\r\n2,000 to 3,000 that were buried secretly, and also the outsiders, was\r\n16,000 to 17,000; more than two-thirds of the population are said to\r\nhave succumbed. The pestilence was borne from Schweidnitz to\r\nPeterswaldau and Nimptsch, where from 2,000 to 2,400 persons died. On\r\nMay 31, 1633, Wallenstein came with his army to Glatz, bringing\r\npestilence with him; in Glatz itself 4,284 people were carried away,\r\nwhile many hundreds died in the surrounding country. Petschkau was\r\nalmost completely wiped out. In Neisse the number of victims is\r\nestimated at 6,000; 5,272 are recorded in the church registers.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, Thuringia was but slightly affected by plagues in\r\nthe years 1631–3, but suffered terribly in the years 1634–5; for in\r\nthose years there, as in all Germany, a great famine prevailed. In\r\nKoburg a plague broke out in the year 1630; in 1632 there was an\r\nepidemic of ‘head-disease’, which carried away 300 persons in October\r\nalone, and in 1634 an epidemic of bubonic plague, rendered even more\r\ndestructive by famine, carried away 1,143 victims. Several pestilences\r\n(dysentery and ‘burning fever’) also broke out in the Koburg region,\r\ncaused by the quartering and ravaging of Swedish troops; the inhabitants\r\ndied by hundreds. Hildburghausen suffered from a plague from June on;\r\nwhereas only 106 people had died there from January to May, the number\r\nof deaths in June alone was 215. In the following year 534 people died\r\nthere from starvation and pestilence, while 169 died in near-by\r\nStreufdorf. Eisfeld (west of Hildburghausen) in 1632 had been plundered\r\nby Swedish troops, and from that time on suffered from pestilence. In\r\nMeiningen, in the latter part of 1635 and the first part of 1636, 500\r\npeople succumbed to a plague (106 in November alone). Suhl, which on\r\nOctober 16 had been burned by Isolani’s soldiers, and Themar—both near\r\nMeiningen—had 1,634 deaths. In the following year 519 people died in\r\nSchmalkalden and vicinity—250 in Tambach, 300 in Vachdorf, and 1,600 in\r\nSalzungen. In the year 1634 the number of deaths in Eisenach was 1,800,\r\nand in the following year 1,600; in the year 1636 there were only 405\r\ndeaths there. Erfurt suffered very little in 1635, while Ohrdruf had\r\n1,065 deaths, Wechmar 503, and Arnstadt 464. In Weimar 1,600 people died\r\nin the year 1635, among them 500 foreigners from Franconia who had taken\r\nrefuge there. The cities lying further east in Thuringia had been\r\nseverely attacked in the years 1632 and 1633, in consequence of the\r\npestilences in Saxony; for example, Gera, which had been infected in\r\n1633 by Holk’s troops, the near-by village of Untermhaus, which in the\r\ntwo years had 211 and 600 deaths respectively, and also many other\r\nvillages in the surrounding country. A plague in Schleiz carried away\r\n600 persons in the year 1632.\r\n\r\nIn Rhineland and Westphalia pestilences broke out only sporadically\r\nin the years 1630–4, but in 1635 they became more general. In the\r\nyear 1630 Münster was attacked, in 1631 Arnsberg, and in 1632 a\r\npestilence raged furiously in the Berg country—in Lennep, for\r\nexample, where the Imperialist troops were for a long time\r\nquartered. In Mühlheim-on-the-Rhine a pestilential disease broke out\r\nafter the departure of the Nassau-Lorraine garrison in 1631. In the\r\nyear 1632 the Imperialist and Swedish armies stood facing each other\r\nin Westphalia for six weeks, and the result was an outbreak of\r\npestilence; 600 people succumbed to it in Bielefeld. In 1635 a\r\npestilence raged furiously along the Rhine; in St. Goar 200 people\r\ndied in the course of the summer. In that year Westphalia was the\r\nscene of warlike events and pestilences; Arnsberg, the villages on\r\nthe Ruhr, Soest, Unna (near Hamm), Horstmar, and Kroesfeld were\r\nattacked. The Governmental District of Düsseldorf (on the left bank\r\nof the Rhine) was severely attacked by pestilence; many people died\r\nin Geldern, while there were 389 deaths in Strälen, 256 in Nieukert,\r\nand 700 in Lobberich.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           2. _South Germany_\r\n\r\n\r\n                     _(a) Bavaria and Upper Swabia_\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Breitenfeld (September 17, 1631) Gustavus Adolphus\r\npassed through Halle and Erfurt to Würzburg, Aschaffenburg, and\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main. Tilly had marched through Halberstadt, Fulda, and\r\nMiltenberg to Würzburg, in order to relieve that city, which had been\r\ncaptured by the Swedes, and then turned south. Thus the principal scene\r\nof the war was transferred to Bavaria, which from 1631 to 1634 suffered\r\nterribly from the ravages of the soldiers passing back and forth. No\r\npart of the country was spared. ‘The Thirty Years’ War’, says\r\nLammert,[34] ‘was particularly fatal and disastrous to Bavaria from the\r\nyear 1632 on; it converted the country into an uninhabited waste,\r\nespecially because it was followed by pestilence. Like the Imperialist\r\narmy under Tilly in the autumn of 1631, so the Swedish army on its\r\nmarches consumed everything it found, and wherever it went in the years\r\n1632–5 it spread ‘hunger typhus’ and ‘war typhus’ and bubonic plague;\r\nall the places along the Main lost at least one-half of their\r\npopulation.’ In September 1632, when Gustavus Adolphus withdrew from\r\nNuremberg, Wallenstein turned south, and there on November 6, 1632,\r\nGustavus Adolphus was killed in the battle of Lützen. After that\r\nWallenstein returned to Bohemia, while the Swedes under Bernhard von\r\nWeimar marched back into Bavaria. The acme of misery was reached here in\r\nthe year 1634. It is impossible to enumerate all the places that were\r\ninfected by the brutalized, wandering soldiers; the most out-of-the-way\r\nand indigent regions, such as the Spessart and the Odenwald, were\r\nvisited by them, and inasmuch as they brought pestilence wherever they\r\nwent, the unfortunate villages were subjected to merciless devastation.\r\n\r\n1. The region of the Main. Since Gustavus Adolphus first had Horn occupy\r\nthe bishopric of Bamberg, and himself marched through Aschaffenburg to\r\nNuremberg, while Tilly returned to Ingolstadt and later to Lech, the\r\nregion of the Main, and later the region north of the Danube, were the\r\nfirst to be attacked by typhus fever and bubonic plague; not until\r\nlater, from 1633 on, did the pestilences spread more or less extensively\r\nin the country south of the Danube.\r\n\r\nIn Aschaffenburg and vicinity a plague broke out in the summer of 1632\r\nand almost wiped out several villages; the city of Aschaffenburg itself,\r\nwhich lost a large percentage of its inhabitants, was revisited in the\r\nyear 1635. In Würzburg the pestilence began in August 1632, and in the\r\nlast part of July of the following year another serious pestilence broke\r\nout there, in consequence of which 489 bodies were buried in the\r\ncathedral parish alone. The prolonged quartering of troops,\r\nnotwithstanding all the precautionary measures that were adopted, caused\r\nthe pestilence to rage with extraordinary fury; not until September did\r\nit begin to abate. In the year 1635, when infected soldiers were\r\ntransferred from Schweinfurt to the stronghold of Marienburg, it\r\nappeared once more. In 1632 Schweinfurt lost ‘several hundred people’ in\r\nconsequence of ‘pestilential purple-spots’ (typhus fever). The total\r\nnumber of deaths was 1,055. In December of the following year another\r\nrather large pestilence broke out, and again in August 1635; in the\r\nlatter year it reached a climax in September and came to an end in\r\nDecember. In Bamberg many people succumbed in 1632 to Hungarian disease,\r\nwhich the Swedes had borne thither in the spring. This disease was also\r\nvery widespread throughout the entire vicinity. In the year 1634 the\r\nSwedes came several times into the region around Bamberg and plundered\r\nthe country, so that famine and plague caused great misery. In the\r\nsummer of 1635 Bamberg was once more attacked by an infectious disease\r\n(typhus fever), and only two houses in the city were spared. In Kulmbach\r\nthe plague raged extensively in the first part of the year 1633; the\r\nnumber of the dead was so large that the bodies could not all be buried\r\nin Kulmbach, and some had to be taken to the churchyards of near-by\r\nvillages. In the following year the plague broke out anew, carrying away\r\n60 persons in a single day. In Bayreuth 400 persons succumbed to a\r\npestilence in the year 1632, and in the following year 360 died; it\r\nraged even more furiously after the city was plundered by the Master of\r\nOrdnance, von der Waal, on August 19, 1634. From July to October 1,927\r\nout of 7,000 inhabitants died, while the average number of deaths\r\namounted to only 167 per annum.\r\n\r\n2. The region between the Main and the Danube suffered no less.\r\nNuremberg and vicinity was severely attacked by pestilence in the year\r\n1632. In the summer of that year Wallenstein encamped near Fürth, and\r\nGustavus Adolphus near Nuremberg; they watched each other for a long\r\ntime without venturing a battle. The country people had all fled to the\r\ncity. In the Swedish army and in the overcrowded city, which had some\r\n50,000 inhabitants, scurvy and typhus fever carried away many\r\nthousands.[35] Only 4,522 bodies were buried by the Church, but many\r\nmore thousands died. Two weeks after his disastrous attack on\r\nWallenstein’s camp on September 4, Gustavus Adolphus marched south,\r\nwhile Wallenstein turned into Saxony. The plague continued to rage in\r\nthe vicinity of Nuremberg, and many people contracted the disease by\r\nvisiting the deserted camp of the Imperialist army and appropriating the\r\nleft-behind implements, weapons, and kitchen utensils. Scurvy was still\r\nraging in Nuremberg in the following year. In the year 1634 the plague\r\nbroke out and carried away 18,000 persons. In December 1631 Forchheim\r\nwas besieged by the Swedes under General Horn, and the result was that a\r\npestilence broke out in the year 1632 and carried away 578 inhabitants;\r\nthe average number of deaths per annum was 45. In March of that year the\r\nSwedes had deserted the city, and in June 1634, when they reappeared\r\nthere, the mortality increased again. In the years 1631–2 Uffenheim\r\nsuffered a great deal from the predatory raids of the Swedes and also\r\nfrom plague, which in the year 1634 became very widespread there as in\r\nall Bavaria, carrying away one-half of the inhabitants of the town.\r\nWhile the Swedes and Imperialists were establishing their camps near\r\nNuremberg, many people from Ansbach and other places fled to Windsheim,\r\nwhich thus became greatly overcrowded; the consequence was that people\r\ndied there by the hundred, and their bodies were buried, thirty or forty\r\nat a time, in large ditches. When the Swedes left Nuremberg and appeared\r\nin Windsheim, they left behind them 450 men who were infected with\r\ndisease; in the entire year 1,564 bodies were counted. In the following\r\nyear the city was besieged by the Imperialists (October 12–23, 1633),\r\nand during this time 360 persons succumbed to a pestilential disease;\r\nthe number of deaths in the entire year, including the outsiders, was\r\n1,600. Windsheim also suffered greatly in the two following years; at\r\nthe end of the year 1635 there were only 50 inhabitants left. In near-by\r\nBurgbernheim, where typhus fever raged in the year 1630, 155 persons\r\ndied in the year 1632, 165 in 1634, and 107 in 1636. In Schwabach, which\r\nhad been plundered by the Imperialists in the latter part of July, 1632,\r\nvarious diseases broke out—‘Hungarian disease, dysentery, and even\r\nbubonic plague.’ In the year 1633 there were 298 deaths in Weissenburg;\r\nin 1634, on the other hand, there were 642. Eichstätt had 494 deaths in\r\nthe year 1632, 827 in 1633, and 982 in 1634; in the last year the town\r\nwas besieged and captured by the Swedes, and for a few days thereafter\r\npestilences raged furiously. The country districts throughout Central\r\nFranconia, like these cities, were almost completely depopulated by\r\nflight and pestilence.\r\n\r\nThe Upper Palatinate was also severely attacked by pestilence (typhus\r\nfever and bubonic plague), which spread far into the Bavarian Forest. In\r\nAmberg an epidemic of typhus fever and dysentery broke out in the year\r\n1633, and in April of the following year bubonic plague appeared; the\r\nlatter disease carried away from 15 to 20 persons on many days of that\r\nmonth, while in July and August as many as 40 people died every day. In\r\nthe spring of 1634 Weiden became infected with typhus fever and shortly\r\nafter that with bubonic plague; from August 17 to November 6, some 1,800\r\npeople died. The bodies were corded up like piles of wood, placed in\r\nditches in groups of 200 and 300, and covered with quick-lime. In\r\nSchwandorf (north of Regensburg) the Imperialists had encamped in the\r\nsummer of 1634; after their departure a pestilence characterized by\r\n‘swellings and large unknown spots’ broke out and carried away almost\r\none-third of the inhabitants. In Hemau (north-west of Regensburg), after\r\nthe Swedes had passed through the town, ‘the malignant pestilence’\r\n(typhus fever) had broken out in the year 1633; and in 1634, after the\r\ndevastations committed by the troops of Bernhard von Weimar, bubonic\r\nplague appeared and carried away one-half of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n3. The cities on the Danube. In the year 1632 Neuburg was occupied by\r\nthe Swedes; after their departure, on October 18, an epidemic of\r\nHungarian head-disease broke out and carried away many soldiers and\r\ncitizens (more than 900 in eight months). Again in the two following\r\nyears pestilence caused great devastation. On April 29, 1632, the Swedes\r\nappeared before Ingolstadt, but in a few days withdrew; there was a\r\nstrong garrison in the city, however, and many fugitives had gathered\r\nthere. In this overcrowded population typhus fever broke out and carried\r\naway large numbers of people. In the following year the disease became\r\neven more widespread, and 1,039 people succumbed to it before the end of\r\nNovember. In the first part of the year 1635 the pestilence abated. In\r\nthe second half of the year 1634 Regensburg was attacked by bubonic\r\nplague, and despite all measures of precaution it carried away\r\ntwo-thirds of the population (according to other reports there were\r\n3,125 deaths). The entire vicinity suffered from the plague. The\r\nmortality in Straubing during the siege of the Imperialists (March 1634)\r\nincreased greatly; even in the year before it had been very high (294\r\ndeaths). The total number of deaths in the year 1634 is not known, but\r\nof three parishes St. Jacob’s alone had 631 burials. Deggendorf and\r\nPassau fared similarly.\r\n\r\n4. Upper Bavaria and Lower Bavaria south of the Danube. On May 17, 1632,\r\nGustavus Adolphus had occupied Munich, and during his short sojourn of\r\nthree weeks apparently no epidemic diseases made their appearance among\r\nthe Swedes. But since typhus fever had broken out everywhere in the\r\nvicinity, strict measures of precaution were adopted by the city\r\nauthorities. According to G. von Suttner[36] 124 people in the\r\nquarantine-house before the Schwabinger Tor succumbed to ‘burning fever\r\nand headache’ between August and the end of the year. According to a\r\nreport published in 1632 the poor people suffered in particular, while\r\nred spots, continual headache, and later on diarrhoea, characterized the\r\ndisease. A very severe pestilence broke out in Munich in the year 1634.\r\n‘The epidemic was caused’, says Seitz,[37] ‘by the arrival of 4,000\r\nSpanish soldiers in July of the year 1634; they were called there from\r\nTölz and Weilheim when the Duke of Saxe-Weimar and General Horn were\r\nthreatening the city. Although shortly after that, in August, a few\r\nevidences of disease were noticed, it was not regarded as infectious.\r\nFinally, however, a real plague broke out with such fury that four\r\nlazarets and a garden outside of the city had to be made ready for the\r\ncare of the sick. It raged most furiously in the months of October and\r\nNovember, when from 200 to 250 dwellings, among them entire houses, were\r\nquarantined every week. Thus it went on until the end of December.’\r\nUnfortunately there exists no medical description of the disease, the\r\nmost important characteristics of which were chills, accompanied by\r\ninternal fever, violent headaches, great lassitude, haemorrhage,\r\nplague-spots, and swellings. All told, some 15,000 persons are said to\r\nhave died in the year 1634—about one-half of the total population of the\r\ncity. The bodies of victims became so numerous that they were piled up\r\nin the streets and houses, without attempt to keep a record of the\r\nnames, and buried in ditches forty at a time. Strict isolation of the\r\npatients by closing up the houses was enforced, and the use of the\r\nclothes and bedding of the dead was forbidden under severe penalties;\r\nsuch effects were burned outside of the gates. Only two gates remained\r\nopen, and in front of one of them a garden was made ready to receive\r\nstrangers who were denied admittance into the city. In February 1635,\r\nthe pestilence had almost entirely ceased, but in September it broke out\r\nanew and did not disappear until February 1637.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1633–4 typhus fever and bubonic plague were spread\r\nthroughout all Upper and Lower Bavaria by the continued marauding of the\r\nSwedes. The Imperialists, no less than the Swedes, helped to devastate\r\nthe country, while the Spanish soldiers had the worst reputation of all.\r\nAgain in the year 1635, especially in the autumn, the pestilence\r\nappeared. A plague broke out in Freising after the town was plundered by\r\nthe Swedes on July 16, 1634 (Landshut had already been captured by them\r\non May 10, 1632), and after their departure they left behind them an\r\ninfectious disease which was diagnosed by the town-physician as\r\nHungarian fever. A pestilence broke out in the city when it was\r\nplundered by the soldiers under Bernhard von Weimar, on July 10, 1634,\r\nand carried away one-third of the inhabitants; according to a list\r\nfurnished by the court the number of deaths was 738, but there were many\r\nmore with whose legacies the court had nothing to do. The bodies were\r\npiled up on wagons and conveyed to cemeteries, while the dwellings of\r\ndiseased persons were closed. In Dingolfing, which was occupied by the\r\nSwedes from July 22, 1633, to June 1634, a plague raged with such fury\r\nthat it was thought the city would be completely wiped out.\r\nSimbach-on-the-Inn and the near-by market-town of Thann suffered greatly\r\nfrom a plague in the year 1634. In Thann many bodies lay for a long time\r\nin the houses unburied, while entire families among the poorer\r\npopulation were wiped out of existence. The plague also raged in the\r\nsurrounding localities, and many bodies lay in the streets as food for\r\nscavenger birds. A plague raged in the years 1633–4 in Traunstein, which\r\nhad already had a few isolated cases of disease in the previous year;\r\n123 people died terrible deaths in the two years mentioned, and also in\r\nthe years 1635–6. In the year 1634 a pestilence caused 500 deaths in\r\nRosenheim, while severe outbreaks of pestilence were reported from many\r\nsurrounding places—Aibling, Miesbach, Wasserburg, and Tegernsee.\r\n\r\nIn Tölz twenty-seven adults succumbed in May and June 1633, to Hungarian\r\ndisease; a pestilence also broke out in the spring of 1634 and carried\r\naway hundreds of people in the months of May, June, and July. From July\r\non, the church-registers contain no more entries; the patients with\r\nblack swellings usually had but a few hours to live. In Oberammergau\r\n‘wild headache’ raged in the years 1631 and 1633, and many people\r\nsuccumbed to it. In September 1634, the town became infected with\r\nbubonic plague, and up to October 28, eighty-four people succumbed to\r\nthe disease—about one-fifth of the population. The epidemic caused the\r\npeople to vow that they would produce the Passion Play there every ten\r\nyears. Murnau, Weilheim, and other places were severely attacked in the\r\nyear 1634. In Andechs the mortality was increased in the year 1634 by an\r\noutbreak of dysentery and typhus fever, and on July 27 bubonic plague\r\nalso appeared and remained until November, carrying away 200 of the 500\r\ninhabitants of the town. In Landsberg typhus fever broke out very\r\nseriously in the year 1630. ‘All over the bodies of the people who\r\ncontracted the disease’, says Lammert,[38] ‘red spots appeared, and then\r\nthe victims lost control of themselves and knocked their heads against\r\nthe walls. Many who seemed scarcely to have contracted the disease died\r\nsuddenly. Dead bodies were found everywhere, even in public squares.’ In\r\nthe following year the disease spread even further; the vicinity of\r\nLandsberg was infected by the soldiers, who were constantly marching\r\nback and forth. After the terrible plundering of the city in April and\r\nSeptember of the year 1633, a plague broke out and carried away a large\r\nproportion of the few inhabitants that were left.\r\n\r\n5. The governmental district of Swabia fared no better than the\r\naforesaid Bavarian countries, while the region on the northern side of\r\nthe Lake of Constance suffered terribly from the predatory raids of the\r\nSwedes and the consequent epidemics. In Augsburg, which from April 1632\r\nto 1635 was occupied by the Swedes, the suffering began when the city\r\nwas besieged by the Imperialists. During a siege of seven months\r\n(September 1634 to March 1635) famine and pestilence did a great deal\r\nmore damage among the population than the bullets and swords of the\r\nenemies. Whereas this population numbered from 70,000 to 80,000 in the\r\nyear 1624, by October 12, 1635, it had dwindled to 16,422. After the\r\ncity had surrendered to the Imperialists, people still continued to die\r\nin consequence of pestilential diseases; the town council therefore gave\r\norders on July 7, 1635, that all refuse should be removed from the city.\r\nNot until the winter did the pestilence disappear. In Memmingen there\r\nwere 1,200 deaths in 1633, and 1,400 deaths in the following year; the\r\nworst year was 1635, when the pestilence is said to have carried away\r\n3,000 persons. The towns surrounding the city were also severely\r\nattacked. In Kempten, which was oppressed by the Swedes and Imperialists\r\nin the years 1632–3, a pestilence broke out in the year 1634 and lasted\r\nwell into the next year, carrying away 3,000 people. In the surrounding\r\ncountry, pestilence raged so furiously that many places were completely\r\nwiped out. In the near-by towns of Kaufbeuren, Immenstadt, Pfronten,\r\nFüssen, &c., the pestilence was likewise very widespread; in 1635 there\r\nwere 1,600 deaths in Füssen—about one-quarter of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe predatory incursions of the Swedes extended even to the Lake of\r\nConstance. In the year 1634 the number of deaths in Lindau was 800; at\r\nthe beginning of the year 1633 Weingarten, Wangen, and Tettnang were\r\noccupied by the Swedes, who brought infectious diseases with them\r\nwherever they went. Tettnang, which in 1633 had more than 2,500\r\ninhabitants, in 1636 had but 150. In Ravensburg a plague broke out in\r\nthe year 1635, reached a climax in September, and in six months carried\r\naway 3,100 people. In Constance Hungarian disease raged in 1633, and is\r\nsaid to have carried away its victims within a few hours; in 1635\r\nbubonic plague also broke out and caused 2,000 deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _(b.) South-western Germany_\r\n\r\nThe battle of Nördlingen (September 5 and 6, 1634) was an important\r\nturning-point in the war, important for Bavaria for the reason that it\r\nfreed the country from the predatory incursions of the Swedes, and\r\ndisastrous to Württemberg, Baden, Hessen, and the Upper and Middle Rhine\r\nregion, whither the defeated Swedish-Protestant army retreated, and\r\nwhere the fighting was now carried on for the next few years. Nördlingen\r\nhad been besieged by the Imperialists, who were supported by a Spanish\r\narmy; Bernhard von Weimar and Horn tried to relieve the city, but were\r\ncompletely defeated in the attempt. The Swedes turned and fled to the\r\nRhine, and in a few weeks the entire south-western part of Germany was\r\nfilled with Imperialists who had followed in pursuit.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings of the inhabitants of Württemberg, partly on account of\r\nthe deeds of violence committed by the Imperialists, and partly on\r\naccount of pestilences, were frightful.[39] On September 10 the\r\nImperialists entered Stuttgart, which they continued to occupy until\r\nMarch 30, 1638. In the year 1631 the city had 8,300 inhabitants, and in\r\nthe year 1634 the number of deaths was 936, of which 672 were due to the\r\npestilence. In the following year the pestilence became more widespread,\r\nbeing helped along by numerous fugitives from the surrounding country\r\nand by famine; the number of deaths was 4,379, and it was necessary to\r\ndig large ditches and bury a hundred bodies at a time. From January to\r\nJuly 1636, there were 319 deaths due to the pestilence, which in the\r\nfollowing year raged even more furiously and carried away 945 persons.\r\nThe mortality was equally high in the year 1638, when the city was\r\noccupied alternately by the Swedes and Imperialists; the latter, when\r\nthey departed in October, left behind them 6,000 diseased and wounded\r\nmen. In near-by Cannstatt 1,300 people died in 1635. In Esslingen a\r\nplague broke out in 1634 and in 1635 became more and more widespread in\r\nconsequence of the continual marching back and forth of the soldiers. It\r\nmade havoc especially among the 12,000 fugitives from the surrounding\r\ncountry, who were packed together in stables and barns, and in many\r\ncases under the open sky. Owing to the incipient famine the pestilence\r\nspread with great rapidity; 12,000 people are said to have died, among\r\nthem 600 out of 1,000 citizens, notwithstanding the fact that various\r\nmeasures of precaution were adopted (removal of refuse, fumigations on a\r\nlarge scale, &c.). In Göppingen, which was occupied by Imperialist\r\nsoldiers a few weeks after the battle of Nördlingen, pestilence soon\r\nbroke out and carried away 656 persons between October 1 and the end of\r\nthe year (1634); in the following year there were 904 deaths. In the\r\nyear 1636 Gmünd had a very severe pestilence, which on many days carried\r\naway from thirty to forty persons; large graves were dug and from forty\r\nto fifty bodies buried at a time. Aalen, in consequence of the continual\r\nmarching back and forth of the soldiers, of quartering, and of\r\nextortions, suffered severely; there, and in the country round about, a\r\nplague raged furiously in the year 1634. Krailsheim and Hall,\r\ncomparatively speaking, fared well. In Hall, the parish of St. Michael,\r\nin which the average number of deaths for the years 1621–30 was 112, in\r\nthe year 1634 had 1,116 deaths (999 in the months of August-December),\r\nwhile there were 372 deaths in the year 1635.[40] The fugitives in the\r\ncity and the people who died there are not included. In Oehringen, after\r\nthe town was plundered by the Imperialists from September 13 to 18, a\r\nvery severe pestilence broke out and carried away 1,131 persons. The\r\nneighbouring towns and villages also had a great many deaths due to\r\npestilence—Neuenstein 1,100, Waldenburg 452, and Künzelsau 900. The\r\nentire Hohenlohe Plateau was severely attacked by pestilence; in the\r\nlittle town of Grossbottwar, first ‘head-disease’ broke out in 1635,\r\nthen dysentery, and finally bubonic plague; between the months of July\r\nand December 692 persons succumbed to these three diseases. In June\r\n1635, there were 775 deaths in Lauffen-on-the Neckar, 1,609 in\r\nHeilbronn, 646 in Weinsberg (out of 1,416 inhabitants), 1,802 in\r\nVaihingen (only 48 in 1631), and 1,019 in Bönnigheim (among them many\r\noutsiders).\r\n\r\nIn the towns on the Upper Neckar and on the northern border of the\r\nSwabian Alp a very severe pestilence likewise broke out. Nürtingen was\r\ndevastated by the Imperialists after the battle of Nördlingen, and in\r\nthe years 1634–5 there were 1,154 deaths in consequence of a pestilence.\r\nThe surrounding country also fared badly; for example, Urach and the\r\nnear-by Alp villages. In the year 1634 a plague broke out in Tübingen,\r\nand in the following year it spread widely in consequence of famine,\r\ncompelling the university faculty to leave the city. The highest\r\nmortality was reached in October (386 deaths), while the total number of\r\ndeaths for the entire year was 1,485. The plague raged no less furiously\r\nin Rottenburg-on-the-Neckar. Nor was the Swabian Alp spared; in the\r\nvillage of Gruibingen there were 90 deaths in 1634 and eighty-six deaths\r\nin the year 1635. Böhmenkirch was almost completely wiped out. In\r\nGussenstadt, whither many inhabitants of the surrounding country had\r\nfled, the usual mortality per annum was 12 or 14; in the year 1634 there\r\nwere 313 deaths up to December 7, while in the year 1635 there were 137\r\ndeaths up to September 23. In the months of November and December (1634)\r\nalone there were 157 deaths, and the inhabitants frequently died at the\r\nrate of 4–6 per diem.[41]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Nördlingen thousands of the inhabitants of the\r\nsurrounding country fled to Ulm, where epidemics had broken out in the\r\nyear 1634 and carried away 1,871 persons. In June 1635, the general\r\nmisery caused a plague to break out there; in the morning many dead\r\nbodies would be found lying in the streets and in front of houses. In\r\nthe course of eight months 15,000 persons were carried away, among them\r\n4,033 fugitives and 5,672 beggars; in the following year only 496\r\npersons died, all told. Even the Black Forest district of Württemberg\r\nsuffered in consequence of the war and of pestilence; Tuttlingen in the\r\nyear 1635 had 546 deaths, Calw 772, and Freudenstadt 434; Neuenburg,\r\nNagold, Sulz, and other places were also attacked.\r\n\r\nHow terrible was the loss of human life in Württemberg in consequence of\r\nthe war and of pestilence is shown by the fact that the population of\r\nthe city decreased from 444,800 in the year 1622 to 97,300 in the year\r\n1639; the population in 1634 was 414,536. In the short period of five\r\nyears (1634–9), in consequence of the invasion of the Imperialists after\r\nthe battle of Nördlingen, and of the pestilence and famine caused\r\nthereby, the country lost 300,000 inhabitants, or about three-fourths of\r\nits population.\r\n\r\nThe northern part of Baden suffered severely in the years 1634–6;\r\nPforzheim lost at least one-third of its inhabitants in consequence of\r\nfamine and pestilence, while Durlach and Mannheim are also reported to\r\nhave been attacked.\r\n\r\nThat part of Hessen lying on the right side of the Rhine was likewise\r\nvisited by pestilence. In Wimpfen-on-the-Neckar a plague broke out in\r\nAugust, 1635, and in the period between August 12 and December 31 there\r\nwere 494 deaths there. Bensheim, Zwingenberg, Gernsheim, Babenhausen,\r\nand Seligenstadt fared no better. Darmstadt, with 212 deaths in 1633 and\r\n220 deaths in 1634, had an increased mortality, but in 1635 some 2,200\r\nbodies are said to have been buried there; at first it was\r\n‘head-disease’, and afterwards ‘a poisonous pestilence’.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Main region suffered terribly in the year 1635 from famine and\r\npestilence; the Wetterau, the Palatinate, and Alsace-Lorraine were all\r\nattacked. Frankfurt-on-the-Main had been occupied by the Swedes in the\r\nlatter part of 1631, and after that the mortality increased; whereas in\r\nthe years 1630–2 the average number of deaths was 1,598, in 1633 it\r\nincreased to 3,512, in 1634 to 3,421, and in 1635 to 6,943. This\r\nincludes all the Protestant population, only a part of the Catholic\r\npopulation, and none of the Jews. The large number of country-people who\r\nhad fled to the city rendered the general condition worse and helped to\r\nspread the pestilence. The worst month was September 1635, in which\r\n1,112 persons died. According to a Frankfurt physician, Hörnigk, the\r\ncrisis came on the fifth or sixth day, while many people contracted the\r\ndisease not only once, but as many as seven times.[42] We see from this\r\nlast observation that the various infectious diseases at that time were\r\nnot distinguished, but were regarded as different stages of one and the\r\nsame disease.\r\n\r\nIn near-by Hanau, after it was occupied by the Swedes and Hessians on\r\nOctober 2, 1634, famine and pestilence appeared; in June 1635, an\r\nepidemic of bubonic plague broke out there, reaching a climax in August,\r\nand gradually disappearing with the beginning of the cold weather. The\r\nmortality among the citizens and fugitives was very great, but the\r\nstatement that 21,000 people died in Hanau is perhaps an exaggeration.\r\nUpper Hesse was devastated in 1635 by famine and pestilence; in Giessen,\r\nfor example, 1,503 people died (according to the grave-diggers’\r\nrecords), and in Lich, a small fortified town, there were 1,225 deaths,\r\nincluding 22 soldiers and 549 fugitives from the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nIn the Rhenish Palatinate, after it was occupied by the Imperialists,\r\nconditions were terrible; famine and pestilence lasted from 1635 to\r\n1639. In the year 1635 General Gallas retreated from Dieuze to the\r\nRhine, and in the same year serious diseases broke out there (dysentery,\r\ntyphus fever, &c.), so that the streets and fields were covered with the\r\nbodies of his soldiers. Wherever he went these diseases were transmitted\r\nto the local inhabitants, so that many places lost more than half of\r\ntheir population. Pestilence was also transmitted to other cities and\r\ntowns in the Palatinate; in Zweibrücken, which had 3,000 inhabitants,\r\n250 married persons died between August 1, 1635, and April 1, 1636; many\r\nvillages in the vicinity were entirely depopulated. In Kaiserslautern,\r\nwhich on August 17, 1635, was stormed by the Imperialists under General\r\nHatzfeld, and was thereafter subjected to an inhuman sacking, a severe\r\nplague broke out in the year 1636 and carried away large numbers of\r\npeople. In Worms numerous people succumbed that year to dysentery.\r\n\r\nIn Alsace an epidemic of bubonic plague broke out in August 1636; it had\r\nbeen brought there by the troops of the Count-Palatine von Birkenfeld\r\nand became very widespread among the fugitives in the overcrowded city\r\nof Strassburg. From thirty to forty bodies were buried in a single day,\r\nand in the entire year there were 5,546 deaths, including 1,000\r\nfugitives and soldiers. The disease continued to reveal its presence\r\nuntil the next spring, and by that time 8,000 persons are said to have\r\ndied in Strassburg. In the year 1635–6, owing to the perpetual condition\r\nof war, which made it impossible to cultivate the fields, there ensued a\r\nterrible famine, and this did a great deal to further the dissemination\r\nof pestilence. Zabern, where there was a strong garrison, and where many\r\nsoldiers were quartered, suffered terribly in the year 1634, and again\r\nin the years 1635–6 widespread pestilences broke out; in 1636 the\r\nImperialists died there ‘like cattle’.\r\n\r\nLorraine also suffered terribly. In the year 1635 Bernhard von Weimar\r\nand Cardinal La Valette were obliged to retreat before Gallas to the\r\nvicinity of Metz, where they arrived on October 1; the troops brought\r\nfever, dysentery, and ‘Swedish plague’ with them; the last-named\r\ndisease, which has been held to be typhus fever, became more\r\nwidespread in Metz in the year 1636 than it had ever been before—it\r\nwas _la plus meurtrière et la plus désastreuse des temps modernes dans\r\nnotre pays_.[43] The precautionary measures of the city\r\nadministration—cleaning of the streets, isolation of the patients,\r\nclosing of infected houses—were of no avail. Many bodies were cast\r\ninto the Mosel, and before the gates of the city the streets and\r\nfields were covered with dead men and horses. Also in the neighbouring\r\ncities, especially in Verdun and Nancy, the losses in consequence of\r\nthe pestilence were great.\r\n\r\nConditions were equally bad in the adjacent Luxemburg. ‘The French as\r\nenemies,’ says Lammert,[44] ‘the Croats, Hungarians, and Poles as\r\ndefenders, committed the most terrible devastations in the country\r\nthrough which they passed. Famine, poverty, and a furious pestilence\r\ncompleted the misery. Entire villages were wiped out; in the city of\r\nLuxemburg the churchyards no longer had room for the bodies, and places\r\nfor burial had to be prepared within the fortifications. Throughout the\r\nentire province 11,000 persons, one-third of the inhabitants, lost their\r\nlives.’\r\n\r\nIn the year 1637 Count Bernhard von Weimar transferred the scene of the\r\nwar into southern Baden, where, during the siege of Breisach, from July\r\n5 to December 18, 1638, an epidemic of scurvy caused increased misery.\r\nIn the year 1639 large numbers of people in the Lörrach district were\r\ncarried away by the pestilence, among them Count Bernhard himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _3. North Germany (1636–40)_\r\n\r\nIn North Germany the war against the Imperialists was continued by the\r\nSwedes under Banner. On October 4, 1636, the Imperialists were defeated\r\nat Wittstock (province of Brandenburg, district of East Priednitz),\r\nwhereupon the Swedes in that very same year overran Saxony and\r\nThuringia. In 1637, to be sure, they were thrown back into Pomerania by\r\nGallas, but in 1638 they reappeared in Saxony, and in 1639 won a\r\nbrilliant victory at Chemnitz. Thereupon Banner undertook a campaign\r\ninto Bohemia, whence, in 1641, he was forced to retire. Shortly\r\nafterwards (May 10, 1641) he died in Halberstadt.\r\n\r\nThese campaigns spread severe pestilences throughout the above-mentioned\r\nregions of North Germany, particularly the southern part of Brandenburg\r\nand the modern province of Saxony. The largest part of the Altmark\r\nresembled a ‘large lazaret’; in Wittstock itself there were 305 deaths\r\nin the year 1636, in Bismark 163, and in Salzwedel 193; in Werben a\r\nplague broke out after the soldiers had been quartered there and lasted\r\nwell into the next year. In Stendal it began in June 1636, and carried\r\naway 1,992 persons in that year, as compared with an average annual\r\nmortality of 120–30; nor does the number include the peasants that had\r\nfled to the city, 3,000 of whom died. The pestilence spread over the\r\nentire vicinity and wiped out whole villages. In Tangermünde a\r\npestilence broke out even before the battle of Wittstock; it was borne\r\nthither by Imperialists and Saxon artillerymen. In Gardelegen, where\r\nBanner had his head-quarters, 500 people in the parish of St. Nicholas,\r\nand 1,205 in the parish of St. Mary, succumbed in the year 1636 to\r\nbubonic plague and other diseases, among the dead being 195 soldiers. In\r\nNeuhaldensleben, whither many country-people had fled, a plague broke\r\nout in May 1636, and spread throughout the entire vicinity; in many days\r\nin September, thirty and more bodies were counted, while the incomplete\r\nchurch register records 778 deaths. The total number of deaths is said\r\nto have been 2,560.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever and other infectious diseases raged furiously in Magdeburg,\r\nand, as before, the country south-west of Magdeburg also suffered. In\r\nGross-Salze, which had received many fugitives, 701 persons succumbed in\r\nthe year 1636 to dysentery and bubonic plague, among them 329 outsiders;\r\nthe climax of the pestilence occurred in July, when there were 162\r\ndeaths. In Egeln, as in Gross-Salze, a plague broke out in May 1636,\r\ncarrying away 164 persons (134 of them outsiders) in June, 63 natives\r\nand 84 outsiders in July. In Wolmirsleben a pestilence raged from April\r\nto the middle of September 1636, and carried away 130 people. In\r\nAtzendorf typhus fever and bubonic plague broke out in the spring of the\r\nyear 1636 and carried away 617 persons, inclusive of outsiders. In\r\nWanzleben 600 persons succumbed in the year 1636 to bubonic plague, and\r\n300 to other diseases and starvation. In Aschersleben a pestilence broke\r\nout on April 2, 1636, reached a climax in November with 217 deaths, and\r\ncarried away, all told, 1,125 persons in that year (including 499\r\noutsiders and soldiers). In Zerbst, where infected soldiers were\r\nquartered, the epidemic was particularly widespread; of the fugitives in\r\nthe city 1,500 succumbed. In Wittenberg and vicinity dysentery and\r\ntyphus fever broke out in the year 1636, and in the fall of that year\r\nbubonic plague also made its appearance and lasted well into the\r\nfollowing year, carrying away thousands of people. In Merseburg, in the\r\nparish of St. Maximus alone, there were 942 deaths in the years 1636–7,\r\nand in Eisleben there were 1,598 deaths (including the outsiders) in the\r\nyear 1636. Halle and vicinity, in the summer of 1636, had an outbreak of\r\n‘spotted fever with dysentery’ and bubonic plague; the number of deaths\r\nwas not less than 3,440.\r\n\r\nIn Thuringia a plague raged extensively in the years 1636–7. In\r\nHildburghausen there were 648 deaths due to a plague in the year 1636,\r\nin Jena 691 (not including the outsiders), while in the year 1637 there\r\nwere 307 deaths in Arnstadt and 525 in Zeitz. In many smaller places\r\ndysentery and bubonic plague broke out, having been borne there by\r\nsoldiers and wandering beggars.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony (present kingdom) pestilences reappeared after the invasion of\r\nBanner in the year 1637. In Leipzig a great many homeless people took\r\nrefuge; within three months 2,500 persons died there, and in the entire\r\nyear 4,229 out of 15,000 inhabitants succumbed to various diseases.\r\nPestilences also broke out with renewed strength in near-by cities and\r\ntowns; by September 1,000 natives and 2,000 outsiders died in Grimma. In\r\nLeisnig, fever, ‘head-disease’, and diarrhoea appeared. After the\r\nburning of the city by the Swedes, a plague broke out and carried away\r\n2,200 persons in six months, including the outsiders. Colditz, which had\r\nsuffered great losses in the last six years, had 352 deaths; the\r\npopulation so dwindled away that in the year 1638 it amounted to only\r\n28. In Döbeln there were 674 deaths, in Oschatz 2,000 (including the\r\noutsiders), and in Mügeln more than 1,000. The near-by cities, belonging\r\nto the governmental district of Merseburg, also had a very high\r\nmortality; in Belgern there were 765 deaths, in Delitsch 881 deaths,\r\nwhile in Eilenburg 8,000 natives and outsiders are said to have died. In\r\nDresden, where in the year 1635 only 79 persons had died in consequence\r\nof plague, there were 1,097 deaths in the year 1637. In the following\r\nyears, moreover, cases of plague continued to appear. A high mortality\r\nprevailed even in the Saxon Erzgebirge, caused for the most part by\r\ntyphus fever.\r\n\r\nIn Brandenburg a severe pestilence raged in the years 1637–8. Berlin was\r\nrepeatedly attacked in 1637 and again in 1639. In Spandau it raged very\r\nextensively, and lasted well into the following year. In Luckau 500\r\ninhabitants died in the year 1637. The pestilence was conveyed to\r\nNeu-Ruppin by an infected soldier, and in the church register of that\r\ntown 600 deaths are recorded. In Gransee a pestilence broke out in May\r\n1638, and in a short time carried away 1,000 persons. Four neighbouring\r\nvillages were completely wiped out. In Wittstock 1,599 persons succumbed\r\nin the year 1638 to bubonic plague and other diseases, and in Pritzwalk\r\n1,500 people died (not including the soldiers and fugitive\r\ncountry-people). In Lychen (district of Templin) numerous fugitives and\r\ntwo-thirds of the native inhabitants died. In Angermünde, but 40 out of\r\n700 families were left, and in Prenzlau a pestilence likewise raged\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nPomerania, while the war was going on between the Swedes and\r\nImperialists, fared no better. In Massow 400 persons succumbed to a\r\nplague. In Ueckermünde, in consequence of a plague caused by the capture\r\nof the city by the Swedes, only eight men and seven widows are said to\r\nhave survived the year 1638.\r\n\r\nMecklenburg suffered terribly in the years 1637–8 from the quartering of\r\nSwedish troops there. Thousands succumbed in a short time to dysentery\r\nand bubonic plague, especially in the months of August and September\r\n1638. Güstrow, in the year 1637, is said to have lost 2,000 persons\r\n(most of them doubtless fugitive country-people). Sternberg, the\r\npopulation of which was completely wiped out by the pestilence, stood\r\nempty for half a year. In New Brandenburg, where many country-people had\r\ntaken refuge, 8,000 people died in the year 1638, according to the\r\nchurch register. Bützow had 261 deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       IV. THE WAR YEARS (1641–8)\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Bernhard von Weimar and of Banner, all centralized\r\nwarfare in Germany ceased, and there began an endless series of futile\r\nmarches across the country. The great depopulation of Germany, the\r\ndifficulty of properly nourishing the few that had survived, and the\r\nwide prevalence of camp-fever, made it impossible to carry out any more\r\nlarge enterprises. Severe pestilences scarcely ever occurred, for the\r\nsimple reason that there were so few people to contract and spread\r\ndiseases. Typhus fever had become epidemic everywhere. ‘In Germany,’\r\nsays Schnurrer,[45] ‘where fighting had been going on for twenty-two\r\nyears, and where soldier-life had almost supplanted civil and rural\r\nlife, a certain war-plague revealed itself in places where there were\r\nsoldiers, and where the war had left its vestiges. This war-plague was\r\ncharacterized by a mucous fever, began with a chill, accompanied by\r\ncoughing, diarrhoea, and, in the case of women, by increased and\r\nirregular menstruation; at the same time the tongue became dry, headache\r\nand insomnia ensued, and at the crisis either the brain or the throat\r\nbecame inflamed, or else petechiae or purpura (then for the first time\r\nobserved in Lower Saxony) broke out. Moreover, this war-plague, if it\r\nappeared to have passed a crisis on the fourteenth or twenty-first day,\r\nmanifested a remarkable tendency to relapse. It was quite as infectious\r\nas bubonic plague, and was called by several names—Hungarian fever,\r\nhead-disease, and soldiers’ disease.’ We distinctly see in this\r\ndescription a mixture of various diseases (especially typhoid fever,\r\ntyphus fever, and others). Schnurrer’s authority was Lotichius, a\r\nFrankfurt physician.\r\n\r\nThe continuation of the war was disastrous to Austria, for the reason\r\nthat the Swedish general, Torstensen, pressed on to Moravia and Lower\r\nAustria. As early as the year 1642 he had undertaken an expedition\r\nthrough Silesia to Moravia and Bohemia; in the year 1644 he advanced\r\nagain, defeated the Imperialists at Jankau in Bohemia in the spring of\r\nthe year 1645, and besieged (unsuccessfully) both Vienna and Brünn. In\r\nthe year 1645 he was hard pressed by the Austrians and compelled to\r\nevacuate Moravia and Bohemia. Torstensen’s campaigns resulted in the\r\noutbreak of severe pestilences throughout all Austria.\r\n\r\nBohemia had suffered as much as Germany from the hardships of the Thirty\r\nYears’ War, while Austrian Silesia, and at times those parts of Austria\r\nwhich bordered on Bavaria, had not been spared. Only in the year 1634\r\nwas Austria itself attacked by pestilences, obvious consequence of the\r\nfact that both Saxony and Bavaria were badly infected. The incursion of\r\nBanner into Bohemia, in the year 1639, had likewise caused a widespread\r\nepidemic.\r\n\r\nAs far back as the year 1644, and hence before Torstensen’s invasion of\r\nAustria, severe plagues broke out in Hungary, Croatia, Upper and Lower\r\nAustria, Styria, Carinthia, and Görz. People who contracted the disease\r\nusually died in the first three days. Torstensen’s invasion caused the\r\npestilence to spread very extensively. In Vienna it broke out in August\r\n1645, having been borne thither by Rakoczi’s troops, and carried away\r\nfrom thirty to forty people daily. Tuln, St. Pölten, and New Vienna are\r\nalso mentioned as places that were attacked. Styria was particularly\r\nafflicted in the year 1646; the district of Cilli is said to have lost\r\n10,000 inhabitants, while the city of Cilli alone had some 400 deaths.\r\nIn Graz, as in all Upper Styria, the loss of human life was not so\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n  V. WAR PESTILENCES IN NON-GERMAN STATES DURING THE THIRTY YEARS’ WAR\r\n\r\n1. The Netherlands. In the summer of the year 1623 there raged in\r\nMansfeld’s camp in East Friesland an epidemic of typhus fever, which\r\nsoon spread among the Netherlandish troops and over the Netherlands.\r\nAntwerp, Brussels, Ypres, Leyden, Delft, and Amsterdam were all severely\r\nattacked. In Leyden 9,897 persons died between October 1623 and October\r\n1624. In Amsterdam 32,532 people died in the year 1624, 11,795 of them\r\nin consequence of the pestilence. In the year 1625, Breda, which for\r\neight months had been defended by Flemish and Walloon troops in\r\nconjunction with the English and French, fell into the hands of the\r\nSpaniards; famine, pestilence, and scurvy had raged so furiously in the\r\nbesieged city that 8,000 people died there, whereas the well-nourished\r\nSpaniards did not suffer at all from pestilence.[46]\r\n\r\nIn the years 1635–7 typhus fever and bubonic plague again made their\r\nappearance in the Netherlands. An epidemic of the latter occurred in\r\nLeyden in the months August-November 1635, and carried away 20,000\r\npeople in the course of the entire year. The pestilence caused great\r\ndevastation in Nimeguen during the siege of the city by the French and\r\nDutch; in the summer of 1635 dysentery and typhus fever broke out there,\r\nand in November bubonic plague appeared and slowly extended its area in\r\nthe course of the winter. From April to October 1636 it raged furiously,\r\nand spared scarcely a single house; from August 1, 1635, to August 1,\r\n1636, some 6,000 persons died in the city, and the pestilence did not\r\ncome to an end until February 1637. It also spread to the country around\r\nNimeguen, especially to Montfort, where half of the inhabitants\r\nsuccumbed to it.[47]\r\n\r\n2. France. In the years 1620–30 a large part of the country was visited\r\nby pestilence, especially the southern provinces during the war of\r\nextermination that was carried on against the Calvinists. In\r\nMontpellier, after the siege in 1623, a virulent fever (_febris maligna\r\npestilens_) raged for eight months, and carried away one-third of the\r\npeople who contracted it. According to Lazarus Riverius the skin became\r\ncovered with red, livid, or black spots, similar to flea-bites; they\r\nappeared between the sixth and ninth days, and developed for the most\r\npart on the loins, breast, and neck.[48] In the years 1628–33 France\r\nexperienced some very severe outbreaks of pestilence, which undoubtedly\r\ninvolved bubonic plague as well as typhus fever. Lyons had 50,000\r\ndeaths, Limoges 25,000, while Paris, Angers, Châlons, Aix, Montpellier,\r\nAvignon, Marseilles, Agen, Dijon, Vienne, Villefranche, and Toulouse\r\nwere also attacked. In Montpellier, whither the pestilence had been\r\nborne from Toulouse, 5,000 people died between October 1630 and April\r\n1631—almost one-half of the entire population. The city of Digne, where\r\na plague broke out in 1629, had a terrible fate; it was completely\r\nsurrounded by soldiers, in order to prevent the plague from spreading\r\nfurther, and by April 1630 some 8,500 out of 10,000 inhabitants had\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n3. Switzerland. The proximity of the scene of the war, which brought\r\nnumerous fugitives into the country, and the marching back and forth of\r\ntroops through the Grisons, resulted in numerous outbreaks of pestilence\r\nin Switzerland. In the year 1622 some 3,000 soldiers were carried away\r\nby an epidemic of typhus fever in the county of Mayenfeld. Pestilences\r\nraged extensively in Switzerland in the years 1628–9. On August 5, 1628,\r\na plague broke out in Schaffhausen, reached its climax in October of\r\nthat year, and carried away, all told, 2,595 persons; 2,000 people died\r\nin the country around Schaffhausen. In Zug a pestilence broke out in\r\nSeptember 1628 and lasted until December 1629, carrying away 468\r\npersons; in Sursee there were 600 deaths, in Sempach 100, in Frauenfeld\r\n400. In Basel the number of deaths in the year 1629 was 2,656. In the\r\nsame year St. Gall, Toggenburg, and Altdorf were severely attacked. In\r\nthe year 1635 another pestilence broke out; the constant misery caused\r\nby the war, and the consequent famine, brought swarms of beggars and\r\nvagabonds from South Germany into Switzerland, which they infected with\r\nvarious diseases. The city of Zürich, for example, on June 14 of one\r\nyear was compelled to drive out 7,400 beggars. All Switzerland was\r\nattacked by pestilence at that time, even the most out of the way\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\n4. Italy was the scene of severe pestilences in the years 1629–31;\r\naccording to Ozanam they were borne there by German troops, and\r\naccording to Häser by French troops. At all events the outbreak occurred\r\nin connexion with the war which France was waging in Mantua against\r\nAustria and Spain over the succession. According to a Venetian\r\nphysician, Grossi, the specific disease was not bubonic plague;\r\nHäser,[49] however, assumes that both typhus fever and bubonic plague\r\noccurred. Lammert seems to think that camp-fever in Upper Italy had\r\nlittle to do with the high mortality. Ozanam mentions buboes,\r\nplague-sores, inflammation of the salivary glands, and black and violet\r\npetechiae. Death is said to have occurred in from one to seven days.\r\nBrescia was first attacked; after the battle of Villabona (May 26,\r\n1629), the pestilence, conveyed by retreating Venetian troops, spread\r\nthroughout Upper and Central Italy. In Verona the number of deaths was\r\n32,895, in Milan 86,000, in Venice (1630) 45,489, (1631) 94,164, in\r\nMantua 25,000. In the territory of the Venetian Republic 500,000 persons\r\nare said to have succumbed to various pestilential diseases. Genoa,\r\nTurin, Padua, Bologna, Lucca, Florence, Parma, and other cities were\r\nalso attacked. Regarding the outbreak of pestilence in Milan, Ozanam\r\ngives us no further information.[50] In October and November isolated\r\ninstances of disease occurred among people who had acquired articles\r\nfrom German soldiers. Strict measures of precaution (burning of all\r\neffects, and quarantining of all persons who had come in contact with\r\ninfected people) prevented the pestilence from spreading. But during the\r\nCarnival these measures were carried out less vigorously, and the result\r\nwas that in the latter part of March 1630 a pestilence broke out in\r\nvarious quarters of the city. Accordingly, two more lazarets and 800\r\nstraw huts were erected outside the city, and shelter for relatives of\r\nthe sick was provided. Notwithstanding this, the pestilence spread to\r\nsuch an extent that some 3,500 persons died every day. In Florence,\r\nGrand Duke Ferdinand II adopted energetic measures against the\r\ndissemination of the disease; infected people, with or against their\r\nwill, were taken to the Hospital of San Bonifacio, where the physicians\r\nthemselves were obliged to remain. Recovered patients were held in\r\nquarantine, and their clothes and other effects were burned. Some 9,000\r\npersons are said to have succumbed to the pestilence in Florence.\r\n\r\n5. In England typhus fever repeatedly broke out after the year 1622. In\r\nthe spring of the year 1643 it appeared in the parliamentary army and in\r\nthe royal garrison during the siege of Reading. The disease, which is\r\ndescribed by Thomas Willis, spread from there to Oxford and the\r\nsurrounding country.[51]\r\n\r\n\r\n  VI. A GENERAL REVIEW OF THE LOSS OF HUMAN LIFE IN GERMANY DURING THE\r\n                           THIRTY YEARS’ WAR\r\n\r\nEven if it is impossible to give an accurate numerical account of the\r\nlosses due to pestilence in the course of the Thirty Years’ War, we have\r\nseen in a general way how epidemics of dysentery, typhus fever, and\r\nbubonic plague followed at the heels of armies, how they were borne from\r\nplace to place, and how the devastation of the country caused by the war\r\nled to an absolute dearth of the necessaries of life, and thereby helped\r\nthe pestilences to spread. We have mentioned only those places regarding\r\nwhich we have specific information, and they can be regarded only as\r\nexamples of how these pestilences appeared; as a matter of fact,\r\nhowever, conditions were very much the same in all parts of the country.\r\nAt the same time these examples show satisfactorily that the great\r\ndepopulation of Germany during the Thirty Years’ War was chiefly caused\r\nby severe epidemics of typhus fever and bubonic plague.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to assemble the figures (such as have been\r\nrecorded) relating to the number of deaths that occurred in a few of the\r\nlarger cities during the Thirty Years’ War. We include Basel among those\r\ncities, since, being situated close to the border of that part of\r\nGermany where the war was carried on during two rather long periods, it\r\nwas necessarily attacked by the prevalent pestilences. At the same time\r\nBasel affords an example of how quickly these pestilences disappeared\r\nfrom the cities, even in the seventeenth century, if external conditions\r\npermitted the authorities to take the necessary measures of prevention\r\nand precaution, and if the cities were not constantly being reinfected.\r\nWe give the total number of deaths, and merely remark that the\r\npopulation in all German cities in the course of the Thirty Years’ War\r\ndecreased considerably. In the case of Leipzig, Dresden, and\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main the still-births are included, but not in the case\r\nof Augsburg, Basel, and Strassburg. As a rule the country-people who\r\nfled to the cities are not included among the dead; only in the case of\r\nStrassburg, and perhaps also in that of Breslau for the year 1633, are\r\nthey included.\r\n\r\nThe total loss of human life in the Thirty Years’ War can be estimated\r\nonly approximately. The statement attributed to Lammert, that the\r\npopulation of Germany, which amounted to sixteen or seventeen millions\r\nbefore the war, had dwindled down to four millions after the war, is\r\nperhaps an exaggeration. Other estimates state that Germany lost\r\none-half of its population. In the case of a few states we have more\r\nexact figures, which probably approach more closely to the actual loss.\r\nThus the electorate of Saxony, which was much larger in area than the\r\nmodern kingdom of Saxony, in the years 1631–2 is said to have lost some\r\n934,000 persons. The population of Bohemia is said to have decreased\r\nduring the Thirty Years’ War from three millions to 780,000. In Bavaria\r\n80,000 families are said to have been wiped out. The population of\r\nWürttemberg decreased from 444,800 in the year 1622 to 97,300. The\r\npopulation of Hesse decreased by about one-quarter. So much, however, is\r\nsure: that in the regions where the war was carried on for several years\r\nthe population decreased by far more than one-half. The most positive\r\nproof of this is afforded by the hundreds of burned-down and unrebuilt\r\nhouses found in so many German cities, and the numerous unpeopled, or\r\nalmost unpeopled, places which Germany had to show at the end of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\n                            DEATHS (1618–48).\r\n\r\n _Year._   _Leip-   _Dres-   _Bres-   _Augs-  _Frank-  _Strass-   _Ba-\r\n           zig._    den._    lau._    burg._   furt._   burg._   sel._\r\n            [52]     [53]     [54]     [55]     [56]     [57]     [58]\r\n\r\n   1618        422      400    1,205    1,354      625    1,343      535\r\n   1619        569      332    1,313    1,485      544    1,258      257\r\n   1620        477      472    1,456    1,667      670      996      259\r\n   1621        613      491    1,652    1,517      674    1,019      352\r\n   1622        580      381    1,045    1,959    1,785    4,388      450\r\n   1623        500      421    1,050    1,875      725    1,738      336\r\n   1624        812      411    1,260    1,370      955    1,491      297\r\n   1625        718      481    3,000    1,392    1,871    1,350      297\r\n   1626      1,268      740    1,874    2,440      963    2,590      330\r\n   1627        537      412    1,227    2,494      773    1,669      266\r\n   1628        388      469    1,020    3,611      680    1,513      527\r\n   1629        506      398    1,116    1,265      832    1,786    2,656\r\n   1630        881      480    1,156      909      927    1,425      220\r\n   1631      1,754      844    1,795      859    1,132    1,383      221\r\n   1632      2,789    3,129    1,395    3,485    2,900    2,675      284\r\n   1633      1,445    4,585   13,231    3,364      762    5,546      456\r\n   1634        306      721    1,010    4,664    3,512             2,115\r\n   1635        603      597      949    6,243    6,943               560\r\n   1636      1,218      594      873      790    2,301               600\r\n   1637      4,229    1,897    1,060      823    3,152               424\r\n   1638        552      531      863      638    1,079               527\r\n   1639        955    1,845      928      674      948    1,923      515\r\n   1640        469      935    1,273      586    1,034               239\r\n   1641        482      525    1,088      887      735      713      195\r\n   1642      1,080      601    1,343      593      883      680      242\r\n   1643      1,034    1,041    1,332      638      523               532\r\n   1644        604      489    1,570      659      491      707      337\r\n   1645        458      532    1,133      758      678               220\r\n   1646        331      481    1,042    1,488      774      651      205\r\n   1647        403      471    1,273    1,338      662      573      238\r\n   1648        469      606    1,111    1,208      575      643      235\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n  THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE PEACE OF WESTPHALIA AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (_a_) CENTRAL EUROPE\r\n\r\nThe Thirty Years’ War left Germany for several decades in such a\r\nweakened condition that Louis XIV was able to perpetrate all sorts of\r\noutrages upon the unfortunate country. The result was a series of\r\nprotracted conflicts in the countries on the Rhine. The German Emperor,\r\nhowever, was unable to fight with much vigour, partly because of\r\ndisruption in the interior of the German Empire, and partly because the\r\nadvancing Turks were gravely menacing its eastern boundary. After Louis\r\nXIV had come to terms with Holland in the Peace of Nimeguen (1679), in\r\norder to secure for his protégé the Archbishopric of Cologne, which was\r\nthen vacant, he invaded Germany without declaring war, and his troops\r\ncommitted horrible devastations in the Palatinate and in northern Baden.\r\nA German army was organized to oppose the French, but it accomplished\r\nvery little. Regarding the pestilences of that time not much is known,\r\nalthough it is certain that typhus fever was present in the armies. Thus\r\nwe learn from a physician named R. Lentilius[59] that in November 1689,\r\n‘burning head-disease’ or ‘Hungarian disease’ was disseminated by\r\nBavarian soldiers who, under Max Emanuel, had taken part in the\r\nsuccessful siege of Mayence (ending on September 11), and who afterwards\r\nreturned home to pass the winter. Typhus fever was conveyed by them to\r\nGundelfingen, Lauingen, Höchstädt, Donauwörth, and Wendingen (all of\r\nthem places on the Danube between Ulm and Ingolstadt), causing a great\r\nmany deaths. In many places—for example, in Gundelfingen—the epidemic\r\nlasted well into the following year.\r\n\r\nIn the very first year of the War of the Spanish Succession (1702–14)\r\nAugsburg suffered terribly from camp-pestilences, which also spread\r\namong the non-belligerent population. In the year 1703 the city was\r\noccupied by the French and Bavarians fighting as allies, and was\r\nafterwards besieged by the Imperialists and the English.[60] The number\r\nof deaths in Augsburg (excluding the still-births) was:\r\n\r\n                               1701   906\r\n                               1702   900\r\n                               1703 1,245\r\n                               1704 3,113\r\n                               1705   748\r\n                               1706   842\r\n\r\nSeitz reports that the troops along the Rhine were again infected with\r\npetechial fever in the year 1712; Metz, on the other hand, expressly\r\nsays that no pestilences occurred at that time.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1733 a conflict again broke out between France and Germany\r\nover the Polish succession. In the year 1734 typhus fever appeared along\r\nthe Rhine; in the spring and summer the outbreaks were sporadic, but in\r\nthe fall, when troops were stationed along both sides of the Rhine, a\r\nvirulent typhus broke out in many places, as in Heidelberg, Heilbronn,\r\nand Germersheim; the disease was borne even to Lorraine by French troops\r\nreturning from the siege of Philippsburg.[61]\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the War of the Austrian Succession (1741–8), which\r\nMaria Theresa waged in conjunction with England and Hanover against\r\nPrussia, Bavaria, Saxony, France, and Spain, we know of several\r\noutbreaks of pestilence. In the year 1742 Bavaria was overrun by\r\nAustrian troops; a severe pestilence broke out in that year in\r\nIngolstadt and carried away several thousand of the strong French\r\ngarrison there. A large number of civilians also died.[62] It is stated\r\nthat the French garrison at Amberg lost 1,200 men, and that 400 of the\r\ninhabitants perished; it is very probable that the specific disease was\r\ntyphus fever.\r\n\r\nAn unusually severe epidemic broke out in the year 1742 in Prague; on\r\nNovember 26, 1741, the city was stormed by the Bavarians and French, and\r\nshortly afterwards it was besieged by the Austrians under the Grand Duke\r\nof Tuscany. The number of men in the French garrison was 13,000, and the\r\nsiege lasted until December 25, 1742. Almost all the French physicians\r\nand surgeons died; on the bodies of the inhabitants of the city appeared\r\npetechiae, which, it is stated, were not observed among the French. All\r\ntold, 30,000 people are said to have been carried away by the epidemic\r\nin Prague. The high mortality was due to the wrong treatment of the\r\ndisease by the French physicians, who held it to be inflammatory and\r\nsought to cure it by means of drastic phlebotomy. ‘Cette grande\r\nmortalité,’ says Ozanam, ‘fut attribuée au traitement suivi par les\r\nmédecins français, qui, malgré l’avis de ceux du pays, saignaient les\r\nmalades jusqu’à ce qu’ils expirassent sous la lancette, et par l’abus\r\nqu’ils firent de l’émétique qu’ils administrèrent jusqu’au 7^e, 8^e,\r\n9^e, et 10^e jour.’[63] (The high mortality was due to the treatment\r\ngiven by the French physicians, who, despite the advice of the local\r\nphysicians, bled the patients until they expired under the lancet, and\r\noverdosed them with emetics as far along as the seventh, eighth, ninth,\r\nand tenth day.) The Prussian army in Silesia was also infected with\r\ntyphus fever, and it was not long before all the corps and the native\r\npopulation were attacked.[64]\r\n\r\nThe Austrian and English army, the so-called Pragmatic army, which in\r\nthe year 1743 operated in the region of the Main, and which on July 27,\r\n1743, won a victory at Dettingen (near Aschaffenburg), suffered\r\nseverely, according to Pringle[65], from dysentery and hospital fever.\r\nThe hospital for the English army was situated in the village of\r\nFechenheim (near Hanau); all the patients sent there, even those who had\r\nsome mild form of sickness, were infected with a camp-fever, which\r\naccording to the description must have been typhus fever, and almost\r\none-half of them died. The inhabitants of the village were also\r\nattacked, and nearly all of them succumbed. According to Neuwied, the\r\ndisease was brought there in the evacuations of the sick and carried\r\neven to England by returning English soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Seven Years’ War was attended by several epidemics of typhus fever.\r\nNotwithstanding the long duration of the war, they did not become very\r\nwidespread, inasmuch as the armies were comparatively small, and as the\r\nscene of the fighting, in accordance with the military tactics of\r\nFrederick the Great, who opposed first one and then another Power, kept\r\nchanging, and thus caused no one region to suffer for any great length\r\nof time. A severe epidemic of typhus fever broke out in Silesia in the\r\nyear 1758; it raged in both the Austrian and Prussian armies, and spread\r\nto many places, for example, to Breslau, Schweidnitz, and Landshut,\r\nwhere the civil inhabitants also became infected. In Breslau, according\r\nto Grätzer,[66] the number of deaths among the evangelical population\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n                               1756 1,375\r\n                               1757 1,554\r\n                               1758 4,088\r\n                               1759 1,697\r\n                               1760 1,590\r\n                               1761 1,724\r\n                               1762 2,373\r\n                               1763 1,808\r\n\r\nAccording to Süssmilch,[67] the number of deaths among the Catholics in\r\nthe year 1758 was 5,135; thus the total number of deaths in the entire\r\ncivil population was 9,223. In addition, the following military persons\r\nwere buried: 5,470 Prussian soldiers, 2,153 Austrian soldiers, 18\r\nSwedish soldiers; also 755 wives and children of soldiers, and 953\r\npaupers and outsiders. The total number of interments in Breslau in that\r\nyear was 18,572. The great mortality lasted from January to June; of\r\n9,349 military persons buried, there died in:\r\n\r\n                            January   1,346\r\n                            February  1,709\r\n                            March     1,246\r\n                            April       940\r\n                            May       1,287\r\n                            June        818\r\n                            July        457\r\n                            August      578\r\n                            September   383\r\n                            October     201\r\n                            November    164\r\n                            December    220\r\n\r\nIn the year 1757, in which there was a high mortality in a large part of\r\nNorth Germany that was unaffected by the war, there was an unusually\r\nlarge number of deaths in Dresden; in the year 1760, when the city was\r\nbeleaguered by Frederick the Great, a ‘virulent epidemic fever’ broke\r\nout and again caused a great increase in the death-rate. The number of\r\ndeaths in Dresden (excluding the still-births) was:[68]\r\n\r\n                               1756 2,432\r\n                               1757 4,454\r\n                               1758 2,603\r\n                               1759 2,631\r\n                               1760 3,514\r\n                               1761 2,127\r\n                               1762 2,008\r\n                               1763 1,975\r\n\r\nThe increased number of deaths during the Seven Years’ War in the\r\ncountries where the fighting took place is shown by the following\r\nfigures (which include the still-births) for Berlin and Leipzig:\r\n\r\n\r\n         _Year._              _Leipzig_[69]           _Berlin_[70]\r\n                          (_total no. deaths_).

When\r\nthe united Imperialist and French armies besieged Eisenach for two\r\nweeks, the disease broke out in both military hospitals in the city and\r\nafterwards spread among the inhabitants, causing many deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          (_b_) EASTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\nDuring the numerous wars that were waged in eastern Europe in the course\r\nof the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, epidemic diseases\r\nfrequently made their appearance. After the siege of Vienna (1683),\r\ntyphus fever broke out in various parts of Hungary, particularly in\r\nPressburg, where many soldiers were congregated. The disease spread from\r\nthe soldiers to the civilians, and the pestilence lasted from November\r\n1683 to the spring of 1684. After the return of the Prussian troops from\r\nHungary, typhus fever broke out in many parts of Germany; for example,\r\nin Minden.[71]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century bubonic plague broke out in\r\nConstantinople and spread from there to the Lower Danube countries and\r\nto Russia, particularly to Ukraine. According to Hecker,[72] this\r\ndissemination was greatly furthered by the adventurous campaign of\r\nCharles XII of Sweden, so that the epidemic included all eastern Europe\r\nand gradually embraced north-western Germany and Sweden. Fleeing Swedish\r\nand Polish soldiers, after the battle of Pultowa (July 8, 1707),\r\nconveyed the disease to Silesia. Danzig was severely attacked in that\r\nyear, and a few cases occurred there in the year 1708; but in the\r\nfollowing year a very severe pestilence broke out, reached its climax in\r\nSeptember, and between January 5 and December 7, 1709, carried away\r\n32,599 persons. From Danzig the plague spread to Courland, Livonia,\r\nPomerania, Denmark, and Sweden. In Copenhagen 20,822 persons died in the\r\nyear 1710, in Stockholm 40,000, in Karlskrona 16,000.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1716–18, when Austria and Turkey once more came to blows\r\nover the Turkish occupation of Morea, which belonged to the Venetians,\r\nbubonic plague broke out in Constantinople and also among the Turks who\r\nwere shut up in Belgrade. The Austrian army, which was encamped outside\r\nof Belgrade, was apparently not attacked by that disease, although some\r\n4,000 men succumbed to intermitting fever, head-disease, and\r\ndysentery.[73]\r\n\r\nDuring the war waged by Russia and Austria against Turkey (1736–9),\r\nbubonic plague appeared along the Lower Danube. ‘It broke out there,’\r\nsays Häser,[74] ‘first during the war waged by Austria and Russia\r\nagainst Turkey, and the result was that the war was terminated\r\nunexpectedly, and in a manner unfavourable to the Christian arms. At the\r\ntime of its appearance in Ukraine (July 1738) the disease was conveyed\r\nby Austrian troops to Temesvar; from there it gradually spread over all\r\nHungary, mostly along the banks of the Theiss to the boundaries of\r\nCarniola, Moravia, and Austria, and also along the Carpathian Mountains\r\nto Poland and Bukowina. The devastation caused by the pestilence\r\ncontinued for seven years, and the measures adopted by the authorities\r\nproved of little or no avail.\r\n\r\nThe severe epidemic of bubonic plague during the Russo-Turkish War of\r\n1769–72 has been carefully investigated by Hecker.[75] The Turkish army,\r\nin consequence of inferior nourishment, was badly infected with\r\nintermittent fever, dysentery, and typhus fever when it set out from\r\nConstantinople in March 1769. When the Russian troops advanced, the\r\nTurks retreated after an engagement near Galatz. Since the disease had\r\nbeen conveyed on ships from Constantinople to Galatz, where many\r\nRussians succumbed to it, the city was evacuated. On the way to Jassy\r\nevery trace of the pestilence disappeared, and in Jassy the soldiers\r\nwere quartered in the houses of the citizens. Since patients suffering\r\nfrom contagious diseases had not been isolated in the military hospitals\r\nthere, in the middle of January typhus fever broke out in them,\r\naccompanied by glandular swellings in the groin. Four weeks later a Jew\r\nand his two children were taken sick in the city and died, the Jew\r\nhaving bought a fur coat in the hospital. Since the Russian\r\ncommander-in-chief did not hold the disease to be bubonic plague and did\r\nnothing to prevent it from spreading, in March 1770 it spread far and\r\nwide in Moldavia and Wallachia. Not until the end of April was the\r\npresence of bubonic plague officially admitted; and then the\r\nwell-qualified physician Orraeus was commissioned to make an\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nFrom Jassy the disease was conveyed to Botoshany, which also lies in\r\nnorthern Moldavia, and there it soon developed into a severe epidemic\r\nand carried away more than 800 out the town’s 2,500 inhabitants; the\r\nrest fled to Carpathia. ‘The patients,’ says Hecker,[76] ‘lay in tents,\r\nand without care or medical help awaited an almost certain death. The\r\ncity itself afforded a sight of complete disorder; the houses were\r\ndeserted and stood with open windows and doors, the air was poisoned\r\nwith the odour of accumulated refuse, and the general devastation bore\r\nsilent witness to the most extreme misery. In addition to that, there\r\nwere multitudes of savage, ravenous dogs, which dug up the dead and\r\nmenaced the sick.’\r\n\r\nConditions were just as bad in Jassy when Orraeus arrived there on May\r\n10; of the inhabitants and of the Russian garrison more than half had\r\ndied, while many streets were entirely depopulated. Since the persons\r\ninfected with the disease were placed out in a near-by forest, where\r\nthey were left without care, many patients were concealed inside the\r\nhouses and their bodies afterwards secretly buried in gardens and\r\ncellars. There was no medical help, since both of the Greek physicians\r\nhad fled from the city. On May 20 the Russian troops, at the instigation\r\nof Orraeus, withdrew from Jassy; a convent was converted into a\r\nhospital, and soon after that the pestilence began to subside. By June\r\n22 it had disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn Wallachia the disease broke out somewhat later than in Moldavia, and\r\nwith considerably less severity. In Bucharest it lasted until May.\r\n\r\nIn Bender, situated in Bessarabia on the Dniester, there was a mild\r\nepidemic of bubonic plague after the city had been stormed on September\r\n16, 1770. The carrying-off of war-booty caused new pestilences in the\r\narmy and in the population of Podolia and Little Russia. For a short\r\ntime in the last part of September the main army also suffered from\r\nplague in its fixed quarters on the Pruth.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish army, which passed the winter in Bulgaria, was severely\r\nattacked by plague, but no further information about this outbreak is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nIn February 1771, Moldavia and Wallachia suffered very little from\r\nplague, although there were occasional outbreaks here and there (for\r\nexample, in Bucharest) until the year 1773; but these were always of\r\nshort duration.\r\n\r\nThe transplantation of this disease into neighbouring countries,\r\nespecially Russia and its capital, was of particular importance. In\r\nconsequence of the widespread occurrence of bubonic plague in Moldavia\r\nand Wallachia when the war broke out in the spring of 1770, large\r\nnumbers of fugitives from those parts gathered along the border of\r\nTransylvania, where a quarantine establishment was opened at Törzburg\r\n(south-west of Kronstadt). In Rukur, a border-village of Wallachia,\r\nwhither large numbers of people fled daily, a Jewess succumbed at the\r\nend of April to bubonic plague, and in the course of the next eight\r\nweeks 60 more people died. From there the pestilence spread to\r\nneighbouring localities, in which 615 out of 3,000 inhabitants\r\n(including 31 outsiders) died. The climax of the plague was in\r\nSeptember. It gradually spread throughout the border-towns of\r\nTransylvania, but only in occasional instances did it reach the interior\r\nof the country; all told, there were 1,024 deaths from the pestilence in\r\nTransylvania in the year 1770.\r\n\r\nSince all the supplies of the Russian army were conveyed to it on Polish\r\nwagons, Polish peasants contracted the disease in the infected\r\ncountries, and then spread it throughout Poland. Jewish pedlars, who\r\npurchased clothes, furs, and war-booty in the Russian camp, likewise\r\nhelped to spread the disease. In Poland the plague became unusually\r\nwidespread, particularly in Podolia, Volhynia, and in the eastern part\r\nof Galicia; 47 cities and 580 villages, according to Chenot, were\r\nattacked, and 275 of the latter were almost completely wiped out. The\r\ntotal loss in these regions is estimated at 250,000. But the disease\r\npenetrated no further into Poland, and Warsaw did not suffer at all.\r\n\r\nSouthern Russia was attacked later than Poland—not until August 1770.\r\nKiev was the first of several cities in which the plague broke out; the\r\ndisease, which was borne there on infected wares from Podolia, carried\r\naway 20,000 people, about one-fifth of the population of the city.\r\nFugitives from Kiev conveyed the pestilence to many cities and villages\r\nin Little Russia, while troops returning from Bender helped to spread it\r\nin the north. In Nieskin, a city in Ukraine, the plague caused horrible\r\ndevastation; it broke out there for the second time in the year 1771,\r\nand carried away from 8,000 to 10,000 people.\r\n\r\nIt was generally believed that the severe epidemic of bubonic plague\r\nwhich raged in Moscow in the year 1771 was directly connected with the\r\nexpedition against the Turks. At that time the city had some 230,000\r\ninhabitants; the streets, full of filth, were narrow, and the houses,\r\nmost of which were one-story wooden structures, stood close together.\r\nAccording to Hecker, the beginning of the plague is obscure; fugitives\r\nfrom the scene of the war, and wool imported from Poland or Ukraine are\r\nboth given as the original means of dissemination, but inasmuch as the\r\ndisease was so widespread in the south, it is probable that it was\r\nconveyed to the north in various ways. Schafonsky, writing in Russian,\r\ndescribed the plague in an excellent book, of which Hecker made use; the\r\ndescription by a surgeon named Samoilowitz,[77] who did good service\r\nduring the plague, contracted the disease himself, and was roughly\r\ntreated in a revolt, according to Hecker, lacks scientific merit and is\r\nunreliable. In November and December, 1770, there were a few suspected\r\ncases in a hospital in the eastern part of the city; Schafonsky\r\ndiagnosed the disease as bubonic plague, while the medical officer of\r\nthe city called it typhus fever. By means of strict isolation and other\r\nmeasures this outbreak was soon entirely checked. As early as January\r\nand February, however, indubitable cases of plague had occurred, but\r\nthey were kept secret. The epidemic really began in the Imperial\r\ncloth-manufactory, where 3,000 working-men were employed; not until 130\r\npeople had died within eight weeks, was this fact made known on March 9,\r\n1771. Since many of the working-men lived in the city and had meanwhile\r\nconveyed the disease to their homes, the measures of prevention came too\r\nlate. The patients were now taken to a convent in Ukresh (near Moscow),\r\nwhile all the rest of the employees were quarantined. But these measures\r\nmerely helped to spread the disease, since many of the working-men, in\r\norder to escape being quarantined, fled and concealed themselves in the\r\ncity. When it became known that bubonic plague was present in Moscow,\r\nthe nobility fled to the country. The people themselves refused to\r\nlisten to any advice; nobody believed in contagion, and in September\r\nthere was actually a revolt in the city against the measures that had\r\nbeen adopted to check the epidemic. The compulsory confinement in\r\nhospitals of infected people and the quarantining of their families led\r\nto numerous concealments. In July the pestilence had already become very\r\nwidespread; many houses in the suburbs were empty, the courts of justice\r\nand workshops were closed, and, since nurses and grave-diggers were\r\ndying off rapidly, convicts were employed to do their work. In the\r\nsouthern part of the city a convent was converted into a hospital, and\r\nat the end of July only one attendant was on hand there to take care of\r\n1,000 patients. The epidemic reached its climax in September, when from\r\n600 to 1,000 persons died every day. By January 1772, the pestilence had\r\ndisappeared. From the month of April 1771 on, the number of people that\r\ncontracted the disease and the number that died were officially\r\nrecorded; the number of deaths (excluding the bodies buried in secret)\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n        _Months._          _Total no. deaths._   _Deaths in Hospitals._\r\n\r\n April (1771)                                778\r\n May                                         878                      56\r\n June                                      1,099                     105\r\n July                                      1,708                     298\r\n August                                    7,268                     845\r\n September                                21,401                   1,640\r\n October                                  17,561                   2,626\r\n November                                  5,235                   1,769\r\n December                                    805                     456\r\n January (1772)                              330\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths, which at that time averaged 7,000 per annum in\r\nMoscow, thus increased to 58,000 (including some 1,000 secret burials),\r\nand at least 52,000 were directly due to the epidemic. About 150 priests\r\nwere victims of their calling.\r\n\r\nDuring the pestilence there was constant intercourse between Moscow and\r\nthe surrounding country, since the necessaries of life had to be brought\r\nto the city, where clothes and household goods were to be bought very\r\ncheaply. Thus most of the villages and cities in the surrounding country\r\nwere infected. Some of the latter were almost completely depopulated,\r\nwhile the estate-owners found protection by shutting themselves up in\r\ntheir manors. Of the more distant cities Jaroslav-on-the-Volga was very\r\nseverely attacked, while Borowsk, Kaluga, and Tula suffered somewhat\r\nless. St. Petersburg was the only city to prohibit outsiders from\r\nentering, and it was consequently spared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\nTHE PERIOD BETWEEN THE FRENCH REVOLUTION AND NAPOLEON’S RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe twenty years of fighting that followed the French Revolution, and\r\ninto which all Europe was drawn, were everywhere accompanied by\r\noutbreaks of pestilence, many of which were very serious. At the very\r\nbeginning of the first Coalition War (1792–7) they played an important\r\nrôle. A severe epidemic of dysentery broke out among the Prussian troops\r\nwhen they were advancing into Champagne, and this was chiefly\r\nresponsible for the failure of the invasion. Typhus fever had also\r\nappeared and caused a great many deaths among the Prussians, as well as\r\namong the inhabitants of the Departments of Meuse, Moselle, Meurthe, and\r\nArdennes.[78] When the badly infected army of the Allies retreated,\r\nafter the engagement at Valmy (September 20, 1792), it left behind its\r\nsick in various cities and villages, and thus infected the French army\r\nthat followed in pursuit. In Longwy itself (which had remained in the\r\npower of the Allies until October 22), and in the immediate vicinity,\r\nthe streets were filled with the bodies of soldiers who had succumbed,\r\npartly to exhaustion, and partly to dysentery.[79]\r\n\r\nVerdun suffered terribly during the siege of the Allies, and at the end\r\nof August was obliged to surrender. The chief cause of the widespread\r\noccurrence of disease there was the fearful lack of sanitation; ‘à\r\nVerdun,’ say Maréchal and Didion[80] ‘une des causes les plus puissantes\r\nd’infection était le dépavement de la ville au moment du siège. Tous les\r\njours on jetait de chaque maison au milieu de la rue des immondices de\r\ntoute espèce, des déjections humaines et animales, des débris, des\r\nvégétaux, qui se mêlant à la boue se liquéfiaient et se putréfiaient par\r\nl’action des pluies. Les agents de la ferme des boues ne pouvaient rien\r\ncontre tel foyer. Il s’en échappait une odeur infecte, quand quelque\r\nvoiture venait à passer, et l’on voyait souvent des personnes frappées\r\nde spasmes, prises de vomissements et même asphyxiées en traversant les\r\nrues.’ (One of the most potent causes of the infection at Verdun was the\r\nunpaved state of the town at the time of the siege. Every day refuse of\r\nall kinds was thrown from each house out into the street—the evacuations\r\nof men and animals, rubbish, and garbage—and there it mixed with the\r\nmud, liquefied and rotted through the action of the rain. The officials\r\nin charge of street sanitation were powerless. All this filth emitted a\r\nfoul odour when a carriage drove through it, and one often saw people\r\nseized with convulsions and sickness, or even suffocated while crossing\r\nthe streets.) There was no more thought of taking proper care of the\r\nsick and wounded in Verdun at that time, than there was in the later\r\nFrench wars; they lay in numbers on rotten straw, in their own\r\nexcrement, two or three of them sharing a single blanket. The result was\r\nthat two-thirds of the patients died.\r\n\r\nPont-à-Mousson, where three military hospitals were erected, also had a\r\nsevere epidemic, as did Metz; the hospitals could not accommodate the\r\nmany patients that came streaming in from all directions. Typhus fever\r\ncontinued to appear sporadically in the next two years; from 1792 to\r\n1795 as many as 64,413 patients were received into the Metz hospitals,\r\nand of that number 4,870 died.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1793–4 typhus fever was frequently conveyed into Germany in\r\nconsequence of the warfare along the Upper Rhine. In May 1793, it was\r\nbrought to Frankfurt-on-the-Main by French prisoners-of-war, whom the\r\nAustrians on their march through the country had left behind. In\r\naddition to the cases of ‘putrid fever’ in the military hospitals, a few\r\ncases were also observed in the city; until November the disease raged\r\nextensively, but in the winter it increased in fury and did not\r\ndisappear until the summer of 1794. ‘The descriptions of putrid fever,’\r\nsays L. Wilbrandt,[81] ‘while they make no mention of exanthema,\r\nnevertheless positively prove that the disease was none other than\r\nexanthematic typhus, war-typhus. The facts that the disease described\r\nwas highly infectious, and that it is expressly stated that diarrhoea\r\nwas not observed, lead us to this conclusion.’ In the report of the\r\nhealth-officer, issued at the end of July 1793, it is nevertheless\r\nasserted that ‘the disease was of a putrescent nature, involving spots\r\nand purpura’. The transportation of French prisoners caused the epidemic\r\nto spread to Günthersburg and from there to Bornheim, but only in a mild\r\nform.\r\n\r\nA short article by Canz[82] informs us about the spreading of typhus\r\nfever from the Rhine to the Black Forest. The disease was borne by\r\nFrench prisoners to Hornberg (near Triberg), where in the autumn of 1793\r\nthey spent four weeks. Owing to numerous outbreaks of ‘infectious\r\nnerve-fever’, a war-hospital for such patients was established at\r\nHornberg, which had some 1,000 inhabitants. In November the first\r\npatients appeared in the town, and the epidemic lasted until the\r\nbeginning of June of the following year; scarcely a single house was\r\nspared, especially among the poor, and often entire families contracted\r\nthe disease. All told, sixty people died, including eight outsiders who\r\nhad been brought to the hospital. According to Canz, infectious\r\nnerve-fever also made its appearance in Kinzigtal, in the Rhine region,\r\nand in several parts of Swabia. ‘In some cases,’ he says, ‘petechiae\r\nappeared between the fifth and eighth days on the breast, arms, and\r\nback; at first they were very small and rose-red, but later they turned\r\nyellow, brown, and finally blue and black, occasionally taking the form\r\nof large blue blotches, like suggilations.’\r\n\r\nFrench prisoners also conveyed typhus fever to Bavaria. According to\r\nSeitz,[83] this was the case, for example in Regensburg, where the\r\ndisease raged furiously in December 1793. ‘There is no doubt,’ he says,\r\n‘that the germ of this disease was brought there by French captives,\r\nsince many contracted the disease and succumbed to it on the\r\ntransport-ships on which they were carried; and Schäffer (a physician in\r\nRegensburg) also saw many people contract the fever who had come in\r\ncontact with them.’ Typhus fever was disseminated all along the\r\nDanube—Donauwörth, Neuburg, Ingolstadt, Vohburg, Kehlheim, Donaustauf,\r\nPfatter, Straubing, Deggendorf, and other places. Kulmbach was also\r\ninfected by the French soldiers.\r\n\r\nDuring the Coalition War violent conflicts took place in western France\r\nin the Vendée, where the Royalist population had risen against the new\r\npotentates. When Nantes was besieged by the Royalists in 1793, a furious\r\noutbreak of typhus fever occurred in that city.[84] The prisons and\r\nhospitals were greatly overcrowded, the city was filled with dirt which\r\nnobody took the trouble to remove, and many carcasses were left\r\nunburied. In the latter part of September the disease broke out in the\r\nprison of Saintes-Claires, where the prisoners were very closely packed\r\ntogether. According to le Borgne, the official inspector said of this\r\nprison: ‘Tout manquait dans cette maison—l’air, l’eau, les aliments, les\r\nremèdes, tout jusqu’aux moyens d’ensevelir et d’enterrer les morts.’\r\n(Everything was lacking in the building—air, water, food, remedies, and\r\neven the means for covering and burying the dead.) Without beds, without\r\neven straw, the prisoners had to lie on the damp ground and be scantily\r\nfed on bad bread and water. Regarding the Le Bouffay Prison, we read:\r\n‘Des morts, des mourants, et des prisonniers nouvellement infectés\r\ngisent sur le même grabat! Les cachots répandent des miasmes putrides,\r\net les lumières s’éteignent lorsqu’on entre dans ces cloaques empestés!’\r\n(Dead, dying, and recently infected prisoners lie on the same pallet!\r\nThe cells reek with putrid miasma, and the lights go out when one enters\r\nthese pestilential sewers.) And regarding the L’Entrepôt Prison we read:\r\n‘La maladie était si intense à L’Entrepôt que, de 22 sentinelles qui y\r\nmontèrent la garde, 21 périrent en très peu de jours, et que les membres\r\ndu Conseil de salubrité, qui eurent le triste courage d’y aller, en\r\nfurent presque tous les victimes.’ (The disease was so intense at\r\nL’Entrepôt, that twenty-one out of twenty-two sentinels who went on duty\r\nthere died within a very few days, and almost all the members of the\r\nBoard of Health who had the sad courage to go there fell victims to it.)\r\nThe hospitals were so crowded that three or four persons were obliged to\r\noccupy the same bed. After December the disease also spread to the city;\r\nof 300 grave-diggers employed by the Revolutionary Committee, the\r\nmajority were taken sick and many died. The total number of deaths in\r\nthe city and in the prisons was estimated at 10,000.\r\n\r\nIn Italy very severe pestilences spread in a very short time over the\r\nentire peninsula, and even to Sicily, in consequence of the war that had\r\nbeen going on there since 1796. These pestilences were unusually severe\r\nin both camps during the siege of Mantua (1796–7). (We shall learn more\r\nabout this in the tenth chapter.) In the year 1799 the French troops\r\nunder Scherer were forced to retreat in disorder before the victorious\r\nadvance of Suvarov and the Austrians, and they took refuge in Nice.\r\nThere, in the autumn of 1799, a severe epidemic of typhus fever broke\r\nout in the French army and soon spread to the non-belligerent\r\npopulation, one-third of which was carried away by it.[85] In\r\nconsequence of the removal of the patients the disease was conveyed into\r\nsouthern France, infecting Aix, Fréjus, Marseilles, Toulon, and even\r\nGrenoble.[86]\r\n\r\nThe disease spread much more widely in the direction of Italy, where it\r\nsoon attacked the entire coast of Liguria. A terrible epidemic of typhus\r\nfever occurred in Genoa in 1799–1800, when 14,000 people succumbed\r\nwithin six months.[87] Rasori had noted the first cases as early as the\r\nsummer of 1799; the patients were fugitives from Upper Italy, commercial\r\ntravellers and military persons. Not until the end of the winter and in\r\nthe spring did the disease become very widespread; it attacked\r\nprincipally the poorer people. Rasori held the disease to be ‘nosocomial\r\nfever’ (typhus fever), and his description of it makes this diagnosis\r\nseem undoubtedly correct. Regarding the increased prevalence of typhus\r\nfever during war-times, we are informed by the following table of\r\ndeaths, compiled by Ozanam:[88]\r\n\r\n            _Year._ _Deaths in Hospital._ _Deaths in City._\r\n\r\n            1794                      392               812\r\n            1795                      477               911\r\n            1796                      761             1,000\r\n            1797                    1,038               900\r\n            1798                      549               803\r\n            1799                      489               809\r\n            1800                      705             1,100\r\n            1801                      929             1,200\r\n            1802                      519             1,006\r\n            1803                      404             1,036\r\n            1804                      418             1,087\r\n\r\nWe note the increase in the year 1796, then the decrease when the war\r\nwas interrupted in the year 1798, and the renewed increase when it began\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nLikewise in southern Germany various epidemics of typhus fever broke out\r\nduring the second Coalition War (1799–1802), and they too were caused by\r\nthe war and the constant marching back and forth of soldiers. Many\r\nplaces in Bavaria and Swabia were also attacked in the year 1799.[89]\r\n\r\nA very severe epidemic of typhus fever broke out in connexion with the\r\nwar between France and Austria in 1805; it devastated all Moravia,\r\nBohemia, Upper and Lower Austria, Galicia, and Hungary. After the battle\r\nof Austerlitz (December 2, 1805) hospital fever appeared among the\r\nwounded in Brünn, and carried away hundreds of French, Russian, and\r\nAustrian soldiers. The pestilence soon spread among the non-belligerent\r\npopulation, which in the months January-May 1806, suffered terribly.\r\nAccording to Hain,[90] the number of deaths in Austrian Silesia was:\r\n\r\n                         July (1805)     3,965\r\n                         August          3,945\r\n                         September       4,204\r\n                         October         4,735\r\n                         November        4,410\r\n                         December        4,501\r\n                         January (1806) 16,399\r\n                         February       14,588\r\n                         March          14,140\r\n                         May             9,087\r\n                         June            6,292\r\n\r\nIn Vienna, which on November 13, 1805, had been occupied by the French,\r\na severe epidemic of typhus fever soon broke out in consequence of the\r\novercrowded condition of the hospitals. The transportation of so many\r\nprisoners of war, particularly Russians, along the military roads to\r\nStrassburg, caused the germ of typhus fever to be scattered along the\r\nentire route; Landshut, Munich, and Augsburg are three Bavarian cities\r\nthat are said to have been attacked.[91] In Augsburg the number of\r\ndeaths was:\r\n\r\n                               1805 1,189\r\n                               1806 1,840\r\n                               1807 1,165\r\n\r\nEpidemics also broke out away from the military roads, as in Ingolstadt,\r\nHof, and Nuremberg.[92]\r\n\r\nIn Württemberg, infected prisoners were also transported through\r\nGöppingen, Cannstatt, and Vaihingen. In the months of November and\r\nDecember 1806 the number of deaths in the French military hospital at\r\nSolitude was rather small, but in January 1807 serious diseases were\r\nbrought there by Russian and Austrian prisoners.[93] Regarding\r\nPforzheim, a town in Baden with upwards of 5,000 inhabitants, we have\r\nmore detailed information;[94] in December and January transports of\r\nRussian prisoners arrived there, bringing with them ‘putrid fever’.\r\n‘Curiosity, pity, a sense of duty, and the distribution of food brought\r\nmany citizens and servants in contact with them, and they were almost\r\nall infected.’ Military hospitals were erected inside and outside the\r\ncity; and it is stated that those who were directly infected by the\r\nRussians suffered much more severely than those who contracted the\r\ndisease later on. Diarrhoea was rare, but on the skin appeared ‘red\r\nspots of varying size and shape, usually like flea-bites; they developed\r\nfirst on the neck and breast.’ The climax of the epidemic was in the\r\nlast part of January and the first part of February; in May it\r\ndisappeared. Of 183 patients treated, Roller lost 26 by death. The total\r\nnumber of deaths in Pforzheim due to the pestilence was 130 (civilians),\r\n77 of them being between the ages of twenty and sixty. The total number\r\nof deaths, which in the years 1801–5 had averaged 163, in the year 1806\r\nwas 346; in the years 1807–10 the average number of deaths was 196.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever also appeared in France in the winter of 1805–6, having\r\nbeen brought there by prisoners of war; Autun, Semur, and Langres were\r\nattacked.[95]\r\n\r\nIn Napoleon’s war against Prussia (1806–7) typhus fever broke out in the\r\nprovinces of East Prussia, where the second half of the war was waged.\r\nAccording to Hufeland,[96] the disease appeared wherever the soldiers\r\nwent in the fall, winter, and following spring; he diagnosed it as\r\nputrid fever, nerve fever, and typhus fever. Hufeland, to be sure, often\r\npoints to the fact that the disease of 1806–7 was in several respects\r\ndifferent from that of 1803; in particular, the disease of 1806–7 was\r\ncharacterized by a long period of incubation, lasting diarrhoea,\r\nmeteorism, blood in the evacuations of the bowels, and a long\r\nconvalescence. But since Hufeland expressly says that the disease lasted\r\ntwenty-one days, and at the same time mentions petechiae and the fact\r\nthat the disease often broke out suddenly, there can be no doubt that it\r\nwas typhus fever. The peculiar mixed character of his description can be\r\nexplained only by the assumption that epidemics of typhus fever and\r\ntyphoid fever appeared simultaneously, and that the two diseases were\r\nregarded as one and the same. Gilbert[97] expressly mentions ‘éruptions\r\npétéchiales’ in his description of these epidemics in the military\r\nhospitals. In Königsberg typhus fever raged in the hospitals and among\r\nthe inhabitants, 6,392 of whom died. In Thorn, Bromberg, and Culm, all\r\nof which had military lazarets, the disease spread from them to the\r\ncivil population. In Danzig, which in the spring of 1807 passed through\r\na siege of seventy-six days, the condition of health was good, whereas\r\ntyphus fever raged among the French besiegers. In 1805–6 the disease was\r\nconveyed by Russian troops to Silesia, where it broke out in\r\nTrachenberg, Adelnau, Ostrowo, Wohlau, Neisse, and Leobschütz.[98]\r\nGerman prisoners brought typhus fever with them to France, where it\r\nbroke out in the first part of January 1807, in the Departments of Aube\r\nand Yonne.[99]\r\n\r\nTyphus fever raged less furiously during Napoleon’s war with Austria in\r\n1809. After the battle of Wagram it appeared in the overcrowded\r\nhospitals of Vienna, and also in Tyrol. Since the war had first been\r\nwaged in Bavaria, the disease had also broken out there (in Landshut and\r\nAugsburg), but had nowhere become very widespread.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever broke out in the form of very severe epidemics during the\r\nlong struggle of the French in Spain and Portugal in the years 1808–14,\r\nsince here the French army suffered terribly in consequence of\r\nunremitting hardships, the scanty supply of food, and the poor hospital\r\narrangements. While in the Spanish Peninsula the French army is said to\r\nhave lost 300,000 men in consequence of disease, and 100,000 men in\r\nconsequence of the enemy’s arms. A particularly severe epidemic raged in\r\nSaragossa when that city was besieged by the French in the months of\r\nJune, July, and August 1808, and again in the months of\r\nDecember-February, 1808 and 1809; of 100,000 inhabitants 54,000\r\nsuccumbed to typhus fever, and of 30,000 soldiers 18,000 fell victims to\r\nthe same disease, so that the city was forced to capitulate.[100] In the\r\nyear 1810 yellow fever caused great devastation in the southern part of\r\nSpain, attacking Cadiz, Cartagena, and Gibraltar; in 1811 it raged\r\nfuriously in the provinces of Murcia and Valencia,[101] but the epidemic\r\nwas confined to the coast.\r\n\r\nFrom Spain typhus fever was frequently conveyed by transports of\r\nprisoners to France; the border districts through which the prisoners\r\npassed were the first to be attacked, as, for instance, the town of Dax\r\n(near Bayonne). Ozanam says:[102] ‘La France en ressentit les effets\r\ndepuis les Pyrénées jusqu’aux environs de Paris, sur toutes les routes\r\nsuivies par les prisonniers espagnols, et l’Angleterre en fut infestée\r\nau retour des débris de ses troupes du même pays. En France la ville de\r\nDax, frontière de l’Espagne, fut une des premières à éprouver les\r\nravages des maladies épidémiques, qui accompagnent toujours les armées.\r\nLa situation basse et marécageuse, jointe à l’encombrement de son\r\nhôpital par des militaires atteints du typhus nosocomial, ne tarda pas à\r\nfavoriser la propagation de la contagion, et elle fut bientôt transmise\r\naux environs. Les prisonniers espagnols y contribuèrent encore, et le\r\ncaractère contagieux de la maladie ne fut pas plus douteux, lorsqu’on\r\nvit les employés au service des hôpitaux et à celui du transport de ces\r\nmilitaires en être tous atteints.’ (France felt the effects (of the\r\ndisease) all along the routes followed by the Spanish prisoners—from the\r\nPyrenees to the environs of Paris, while England was infected by the\r\nremnants of its troops when they returned from France. The town of Dax,\r\nsituated near the border between France and Spain, was one of the first\r\nplaces to experience the ravages of the epidemic diseases which always\r\naccompanied the armies. Its low, marshy situation, together with the\r\nfact that its hospital was overcrowded with soldiers infected with\r\nnosocomial typhus, greatly favoured the propagation of the contagion,\r\nwhich soon spread throughout the vicinity. The Spanish prisoners also\r\nhelped to spread it, and the contagious character of the disease was no\r\nlonger questionable when the attendants at the hospitals, as well as the\r\nmen who had charge of transporting the sick, were seen to contract it.)\r\n\r\nThe Spanish prisoners were sent far into the interior, and caused\r\noutbreaks of pestilence wherever they went. In consequence of the strain\r\nand exertion involved in their transportation, and also of the inferior\r\nfood, typhus fever soon became very widespread among them. Diseased and\r\nwounded men were always carried in the same wagons, while it was often\r\nnecessary to remain for a considerable length of time in camps, where\r\nsick and healthy men lay side by side on straw; thus many died on the\r\nway. In order to prevent the disease from spreading to the civil\r\npopulation, it was arranged that the buildings designated for the\r\nprisoners should lie away from the town where the soldiers were\r\nquartered, or that the prisoners should be sheltered in barracks. All\r\nintercourse between the prisoners and the inhabitants was forbidden, and\r\nafter their departure the straw used by them was burned, and the\r\nbuildings they had occupied were fumigated.[103]\r\n\r\nSince, however, it finally became necessary to house the sick in\r\nhospitals, it was absolutely impossible to prevent the disease from\r\nspreading. The result was that the following places in Central France\r\nwere attacked: Limoges, Guéret, Châteauroux, Issoudun, Moulins, Nevers,\r\nLa Charité, and Bourges.[104] As people everywhere were afraid of\r\ncontracting the disease, the prisoners were transferred as soon as\r\npossible to near-by districts, and this merely helped to spread the\r\ndisease. According to Boin, Bourges, in the year 1809, became the\r\nrendezvous of all Spanish prisoners, who were housed there in barracks\r\nand in public hospitals; of 653 prisoners of war received in the public\r\nhospitals, 103 died. In the city itself only a few cases of typhus fever\r\nwere observed. The highly contagious nature of the disease was well\r\nknown to Boin, who says:\r\n\r\n‘Les dames religieuses de la Charité, chargées du service des salles,\r\nles élèves en chirurgie, les servans, les gardes de nuit, le casernier,\r\nles gendarmes qui escortaient les voitures remplies de prisonniers\r\nmalades, le chapelain, le secrétaire du commissaire des guerres, les\r\npersonnes que la charité évangélique a fait imprudemment entrer dans les\r\nsalles, ont été frappés de la maladie. Tous ont couru des risques,\r\nquelques-uns ont succombé.’ (The nuns who had charge of the rooms (in\r\nthe hospital) at La Charité, the medical students, the attendants, the\r\nnight-watchmen, the porter, the gendarmes who escorted the carriages\r\nconveying sick prisoners, the chaplain, the secretary of the War\r\nCommissioner, and the persons who imprudently allowed a sense of duty\r\nand charity to induce them to enter the rooms—all contracted the\r\ndisease. They all ran risks, and some of them died.) Nevertheless, Boin\r\ndid not hold the disease in Bourges to be typhus fever, but a ‘fièvre\r\nmaligne putride’; he also adds that he failed to observe petechiae in a\r\nsingle instance. The physicians sent by the Government, on the other\r\nhand, diagnosed the disease as ‘hospital fever’. Inasmuch as there is no\r\ndoubt expressed anywhere else regarding the appearance of typhus fever\r\namong the Spanish prisoners (Ozanam speaks expressly of the appearance\r\nof petechiae on the second, third, or fourth day), it was undoubtedly\r\nthat disease which broke out in Bourges.\r\n\r\nNot only the French, but also the English troops were attacked by typhus\r\nfever in Spain and Portugal; they are said to have lost 24,930 men in\r\nconsequence of diseases, and 8,889 men in consequence of battles and\r\nskirmishes. The disease was conveyed to England by returning soldiers,\r\nbut was confined there to a few houses. After the battles of the year\r\n1808, which went against the English, the badly infected English troops\r\nwere transported on ships in stormy weather to Plymouth, where from\r\nJanuary 24, 1808, to January 24, 1809, some 2,427 of them were received\r\ninto the hospitals. Of that number 824 were suffering from typhus fever,\r\nand 1,503 from dysentery; all told, 405 died.[105]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n   THE EPIDEMICS OF TYPHUS FEVER IN CENTRAL EUROPE FOLLOWING UPON THE\r\n      RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN AND DURING THE WARS OF LIBERATION (1812–14)\r\n\r\n\r\n             1. GENERAL OBSERVATIONS REGARDING TYPHUS FEVER\r\n\r\nTyphus fever, as a specific disease, was well known to the military\r\nphysicians during the age of Napoleon, since, as set forth in the\r\nprevious chapter, it regularly appeared during the numerous Napoleonic\r\nwars in the form of widespread epidemics. In France the simple word\r\n‘typhus’ was often used to denote the disease, and the custom still\r\nprevails there. In Germany the disease was called infectious nerve\r\nfever, war plague, lazaret fever, &c.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century it was generally believed\r\nthat great hardships, colds, lack of the necessaries of life, and the\r\nconsequent consumption of spoiled foodstuffs give rise to fevers, and\r\nthat these fevers, in accordance with the epidemic character of the year\r\nand of the season, and also in accordance with the severity of the\r\nhardships undergone, might develop into dysentery and typhus fever. At\r\nall events, even the eminent physicians of the day, men like Hildenbrand\r\nof Vienna[106] and Hufeland of Berlin, who in the course of two decades\r\nhad abundant opportunity to study the disease, assumed that it is\r\npossible for typhus fever to break out spontaneously. It was believed\r\nthat this fever, originating spontaneously, gradually developed the\r\npower of infection. Hufeland’s position was self-contradictory, for he\r\nassumes that the disease can break out spontaneously and yet that it can\r\nbe warded off by means of isolation.[107] He says: ‘A proof of the fact\r\nthat this disease can spread only through infection is offered by the\r\nstronghold of Küstrin, which, being closed up tightly during the entire\r\nyear of 1813, was free from disease, whereas all the surrounding\r\ncountry, even the army of the besiegers, suffered terribly.’ Whereupon\r\nHufeland immediately adds: ‘The war carried on among us and by us with\r\nsuch unheard-of exertion and hardship caused the disease to break out\r\nseveral times anew throughout our country, and hence it could but become\r\ngeneral.’ That it is possible for typhus fever to break out\r\nspontaneously and subsequently spread by infection was everywhere\r\nbelieved, even by French physicians. It is hardly necessary to say,\r\nhowever, that the theory of the spontaneous origination of the disease\r\ndoes not accord with modern views. The severe hardships undergone, the\r\nhunger and cold, the effluvium of gangrenous wounds, the moral\r\ndepression, and the many other bad effects which characterized this war\r\nmore than any other, necessarily decreased the soldiers’ power of\r\nresistance and increased their susceptibility to infection.\r\nIncidentally, all sorts of telluric and meteorological phenomena,\r\nvolcanic eruptions, earthquakes, the great heat and dryness of the year\r\n1811, the meteors of that year—all these things were at the time brought\r\ninto causal connexion with the war pestilences of the years 1813–14.\r\n\r\n‘Many people stated positively’, says Hufeland,[108] ‘that they\r\ncontracted the disease almost immediately after they had occupied small,\r\nnarrow rooms in company with infected French soldiers, or after they had\r\nwashed their clothes or waited upon them. This frequently happened in\r\nsmall houses that undertook, for a small profit, to shelter invalid\r\nsoldiers quartered upon the wealthier citizens. Many asserted that they\r\ncontracted the disease by passing the night in small inns in the towns\r\nand villages around Berlin, and on the roads from Königsberg, Danzig,\r\nand Frankfurt, and by sleeping on beds or straw which had shortly before\r\nbeen used by infected Frenchmen or Russians. A certain number of men\r\ncontracted typhus fever by serving as attendants, in order to earn a\r\nlittle money, in the local French military hospital. In this way many of\r\nthe servants and attendants employed there, as well as numerous surgeons\r\nand apothecaries, contracted the disease and subsequently infected the\r\nmembers of their families who brought them home and took care of them,\r\nand who, in turn, infected the other inhabitants of the house and of the\r\nneighbouring houses.’ Further on, Hufeland adds that only those inmates\r\nof the hospital contracted the disease who, as servants and attendants,\r\nhad been in close and constant contact with the patients.\r\n\r\nIn the years 1813–14 a large number of physicians were carried away by\r\ntyphus fever; it was estimated at that time that some 500 of them\r\nthroughout Germany (excluding the surgeons) fell victims to the\r\ndisease—in Silesia alone 63 physicians died, in Leipzig 17, in\r\nWürttemberg 17, and in Baden 35.[109]\r\n\r\nEmphasis was always laid upon the fact that the clothes and other\r\neffects of people who had succumbed to typhus fever were highly\r\ninfectious. The wide prevalence of the disease among the Jewish\r\ninhabitants of Vilna was attributed to ignorance or disregard of this\r\nfact; for when orders were issued to destroy such clothing, the Jews,\r\nout of sheer avarice, disobeyed them. The persons who acquired such\r\neffects in this cheap and illicit manner usually paid the penalty\r\nthemselves; in addition, they did a great deal toward spreading the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe military hospitals were also largely responsible for the\r\ndissemination of typhus fever; Parenteau-Desgranges[110] called them\r\noutright ‘centres de contagion’. The cities in which military hospitals\r\nwere erected were always severely attacked by the disease. It was\r\ngenerally complained, even by the French physicians, that the French\r\nhospitals were poorly arranged and badly managed—even simple cleanliness\r\nand competent attendants were lacking. Patients suffering from\r\ninfectious disease were placed together with others suffering from some\r\nmild form of sickness or from a wound, thus giving the infection the\r\nbest conceivable chance to spread. Let us read how a French physician\r\ndescribes the conditions in Verdun during the severe epidemic of typhus\r\nfever that raged there in the years 1792–5:[111]\r\n\r\n‘The disease spread with no less severity from other sources of\r\ninfection, such as the temporary hospitals established in the Convent of\r\nCanons of Saint Nicholas, in the Monastery of Saint Vannes, and in the\r\nbarracks. The unfortunate patients, thrown in heaps on the damp stone\r\nand earth floors, scarcely having under them a few mats, or perhaps some\r\ndirty straw, filthy with their excrement, three of them often sharing a\r\nsingle blanket of coarse wool, presented the most dismal picture one\r\ncould possibly imagine. At least three-quarters of the patients died.\r\nThey were buried in huge ditches dug in the vicinity of the ramparts,\r\nand in the gardens surrounding the abbeys of Saint Vannes and of Saint\r\nNicholas.’\r\n\r\nThe German Central Hospital Management, which was founded in the latter\r\npart of November 1813, and from which Bavaria and Württemberg held\r\naloof, sought to introduce certain improvements into the military\r\nlazaret system, but it was unable to accomplish a great deal, owing to\r\nthe lack of hospitals, physicians, and all the means necessary for the\r\ntreatment of sick and injured people.\r\n\r\nVery dangerous for the dissemination of the disease was the belief that\r\nthe placing of typhus fever patients together with other invalids did no\r\nharm, but rather that the congregating of numerous typhus fever patients\r\nby themselves caused the contagion to develop with especial severity.\r\nThe Saxon staff surgeon Neumann, for example, writes in regard to this\r\nquestion:[112] ‘Anybody who lies in a bed to which the poison is still\r\nclinging will without fail contract the disease; on the other hand, I\r\nhave often seen people suffering from other forms of sickness lie\r\nalongside of typhus-fever patients and escape infection, provided they\r\nhad nothing in common, did not touch one another, or make use of one\r\nanother’s linen. Hence I draw the conclusion that the poison of typhus\r\nfever, like the poison of bubonic plague and small-pox, cannot enter the\r\nsystem from a distance, not even from a very short distance, and can be\r\ncommunicated only by close and direct contact. This seems to contradict\r\nour experience that the intensity of the poison is greatly increased\r\nwhen several patients lie side by side. Accordingly, I warn all military\r\nphysicians not to congregate all their typhus fever patients in a single\r\nroom by themselves; for few would come forth from such a room alive,\r\nwhile the poisoned atmosphere of the room would pervade the entire\r\nlazaret, infect the physicians and attendants, and finally spread\r\nthroughout the immediate neighbourhood. People think that they can\r\nprevent the disease from spreading by congregating and isolating the\r\npatients, but as a matter of fact this has the opposite effect. This is\r\nclear when we consider that the mere being together of unhealthy people\r\ncauses the poison to develop, and that not only the people themselves,\r\nbut also the very exhalations from their bodies, are sufficient to\r\nspread the infection. For example, if a considerable quantity of dirty\r\nclothes or linen is allowed to accumulate in a pile, and after a short\r\ntime is picked up, the usual result is that the people who do the work\r\nexperience a severe attack of typhus fever.’\r\n\r\nVery often conditions made segregation impossible, even when it was\r\ndesired, or else the French generals refused to permit it. Consequently,\r\ninfection was so frequent in the hospitals that the disease at a very\r\nearly date acquired the name ‘hôpital fever’ (fièvre d’hôpital).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the weather conditions exerted some influence was not to\r\nbe overlooked; in the year 1813, when the warm weather began, the\r\ndisease abated a little, whereas in the year 1814 it ceased altogether\r\nat the beginning of the warm weather. The reason for this was that the\r\ncold weather forced people to huddle together in houses, and that\r\nbathing and washing, particularly among the soldiers and poor people,\r\nwas less frequently and profusely indulged in; another reason was that\r\nthe heavier clothing worn in winter facilitated the breeding of vermin.\r\n\r\nFailure to take measures of precaution, if the disease once broke out in\r\na neighbouring place, also contributed greatly toward the dissemination\r\nof it. ‘If typhus fever was present in any military halting-place,\r\nfrequently nothing was done to prevent it from infecting the next place,\r\nwhere it had not yet made its appearance; or, if anything was done, it\r\nwas often merely to issue an order which was not complied with.’[113] At\r\nthe same time, to be sure, one must take into account the fact that\r\nsheer ignorance rendered useful measures impossible. If this ignorance\r\nprevailed in the highest places, nothing better was to be expected of\r\nthe small cities and towns.\r\n\r\nThat the ‘contagious typhus’ prevalent during the Napoleonic wars was\r\nthe same disease which we call typhus fever is very certain. The\r\nphysicians of the middle of the nineteenth century, when views of typhus\r\nand typhoid fever had cleared up somewhat, have confirmed this\r\nfact.[114] The descriptions of the disease are almost invariably\r\nreproductions of the same picture, the sole difference being that it was\r\nmuch more severe and fatal among the half-starved soldiers on their\r\nreturn from Russia, and among soldiers packed together in strongholds,\r\nthan it was among people who were less afflicted by the war and who\r\nlived at a distance from the military routes.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the disease broke out eight or nine days after infection. It\r\nbegan with a general indisposition, which lasted several days, or, if\r\nthis indisposition failed to appear, with a chill, great languor, loss\r\nof appetite, and weakness in the limbs; frequently brain disorders also\r\nmanifested themselves, at first in the form of a mild stupefaction,\r\nsinging in the ears, violent headache, somnolence, or wild delirium. The\r\nexanthema usually appeared between the fourth and the seventh day.\r\nHufeland describes it as ‘an outbreak of red spots, covering most of the\r\nbody; they were mostly of a violet tinge, but were not sharply defined,\r\nand often gradually merged into the colour of the rest of the skin’. It\r\nwas frequently asserted that the petechiae now and then failed to appear\r\nat all, even in severe cases. Jörg says expressly:[115] ‘Sometimes they\r\nbroke out sparsely, one here and one there, and in such cases it was\r\neasy to overlook them.’ After the disease had progressed for two or\r\nthree weeks the patient’s temperature went down, and there were few\r\nfatalities after the twenty-first day. Convalescence was of short\r\nduration, provided the outbreak had not been preceded by exhaustion due\r\nto hardships. In regard to abdominal and intestinal symptoms, great\r\ndissimilarity was observed; Hufeland states that when there were no\r\ncomplications, an autopsy revealed not the slightest change in the\r\nintestinal organs, and Horn says that ‘the colour of the intestines was\r\noften almost natural.’ The severity of the disease varied greatly; it\r\nwas particularly fatal among the soldiers homeward-bound from Russia,\r\nmore than half of whom died. It is frequently asserted that the majority\r\nof those who were thus directly infected succumbed to the disease, and\r\nthat it carried away some ten per cent of the civil inhabitants who\r\ncontracted it.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be a mistake to say that all the epidemics of that\r\ntime were epidemics of typhus fever; undoubtedly typhoid fever carried\r\naway large numbers of people, since it is to be assumed that the disease\r\nwas endemic in many cities. But owing to the inaccuracy of the\r\ndescriptions and the lack of autopsies, it is usually impossible to\r\ndistinguish the diseases with certainty. Even when the results of\r\nautopsies were made known, the condition of the intestines was often\r\ndescribed so inaccurately that we cannot even make out whether or not\r\nthere were intestinal ulcers, which are the most important\r\npathological-anatomical symptoms of typhoid fever. But the initial\r\nchill, the short duration of the disease (three weeks), the presence of\r\npetechiae, the rapid fall of temperature, and the shorter convalescence,\r\nall of which are ever-recurring symptoms, enable us to distinguish the\r\nepidemic of the years 1812–14 with certainty from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nThrough the influence of the works of Hildenbrand and Hufeland the\r\nlarger part of the medical world of that time came to look upon\r\ncontagious typhus as a specific disease; other views, however, were\r\nvigorously supported, for example, by Markus of Bamberg, who held it to\r\nbe an inflammation of the brain. The difference of opinion regarding the\r\ncharacter of the disease was important, not only theoretically, but also\r\npractically, in view of the therapeutic practice of the time; for those\r\nwho regarded the disease as an inflammation of the brain had naturally,\r\nin accordance with the methods then in vogue, to resort to bleeding. But\r\nall unprejudiced observers came to the conclusion that bleeding was\r\nharmful, and that it killed all the patients upon whom it was frequently\r\npractised. Very soon the beneficial influence of fresh air and cold came\r\nto be recognized, and the latter was often provided by means of\r\ncold-water baths and douches. ‘It was a universally confirmed principle,\r\nderived from experience, that the warmer the patients were kept, the\r\nmore severe was the disease, and the colder they were kept, the milder\r\nthe disease.’ How beneficial fresh air was for the patients was shown by\r\nthe fact that those who were kept out in the open air withstood the\r\ndisease much more easily than those who were kept shut up in houses and\r\nhospitals, and that it was much less dangerous to transport patients\r\nfrom place to place in the open air, than to keep them shut up in\r\novercrowded hospitals. ‘Thousands of patients’, says H. Häser,[116]\r\n‘survived even the most severe forms of the disease without human help\r\nof any kind. Many, especially physicians, attributed their recovery to\r\nthe fact that for weeks at a time they were constantly being transported\r\nin the cold winter from one halting-place to another, and were not\r\ncompelled to lie in overcrowded hospitals, where typhus fever and\r\ndysentery raged most terribly.’\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the epidemic of typhus fever of the years 1812–14 we\r\nhave a double epidemic to consider. The one was disseminated directly by\r\nthe returning remnants of the ‘Grand Army’, and after causing terrible\r\ndevastation in East Prussia it spread, in a relatively milder form, to\r\nother parts of Germany. The other epidemic broke out during the great\r\nbattles in Saxony, which lasted several months, and from there spread\r\nvirulently over a large part of Germany. In order to avoid repetition,\r\nthe following account will treat of the dissemination of the two\r\nepidemics jointly.\r\n\r\n\r\n        2. THE RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN AND TYPHUS FEVER IN RUSSIA[117]\r\n\r\nNapoleon began to make preparations for his Russian campaign as early as\r\nthe year 1811; troops were assembled in Westphalia, Hamburg, Saxony,\r\nHolland, on the Rhine, and near Verona, and several hospitals were\r\nfounded, as in Danzig. An army of 550,000 men was organized to take part\r\nin the expedition into Russia; it consisted of Frenchmen, Germans,\r\nItalians, Spaniards, and Poles. How this army was destroyed on its march\r\nto and from Moscow, and in what a pitiable condition the remnants of it\r\narrived in Germany, is well known. Since it is our purpose to point out\r\nhere how that severe epidemic of typhus fever spread abroad from those\r\nremnants, we can deal but briefly with the prevalence of the disease in\r\nthe army itself.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the great heat, of the lack of drinking-water and good\r\nfood, and of the continual bivouacking (the peasants burned and deserted\r\nall the villages along the way), the army suffered greatly even on the\r\nmarch to Moscow. After crossing the Polish border the soldiers were\r\nseverely attacked by dysentery and diarrhoea; Kerckhoffs estimates that\r\nno less than 80,000 men were suffering from dysentery at the beginning\r\nof August 1812. Typhus fever broke out, very sparsely, to be sure, as\r\nearly as the latter part of July, when the army arrived at Vilna; there\r\nwere also cases in the hospitals at Minsk, Vilkomir, Globokie, and\r\nMittau, but the disease was not yet so infectious as it proved to be\r\nlater. After the battle of Smolensk (August 14–18) large numbers of\r\nwounded soldiers (between 6,000 and 10,000 according to various reports)\r\nwere brought to that city, and from that time on, typhus fever and other\r\ndiseases (hospital fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, gastric fever, &c.)\r\ncontinued to spread throughout the army. On September 14, Moscow was\r\nentered, and on September 15 the city was in flames. The army then had\r\npeace until October 19, when the return march began. During their\r\nsojourn in Moscow the soldiers were very improperly nourished, eating\r\nalmost nothing but salted meat and fish, and drinking large quantities\r\nof wine and spirits. According to Lemazurier, the number of sick and\r\nwounded soldiers in Moscow was 15,000. The most common disease even in\r\nMoscow was typhus fever; according to Scheerer, when Napoleon’s army\r\nwithdrew from the city it left behind several thousand typhus-fever\r\npatients, almost all of whom died—only the stronger patients were taken\r\nalong on wagons.\r\n\r\nThe horrors of the return march are well known. Thousands froze to death\r\nin the extreme cold of November, horse-meat and melted snow were the\r\nsole means of nourishment, and any soldier who lay down was\r\nirretrievably lost. Between Moscow and Smolensk, which was reached on\r\nNovember 9, one-half of the soldiers who had started out from Moscow\r\ndied; the number of sick soldiers was enormous, and typhus fever raged\r\nmore and more extensively. On December 8 Vilna was reached, but there\r\nthe army was not given a moment’s rest; two days later the Russians\r\nadvanced and captured 30,000 of Napoleon’s soldiers who could go no\r\nfurther.\r\n\r\nIn pursuing the French army the Russians also suffered severely from\r\ndiseases; according to Ebstein,[118] between October 20 and December 14,\r\n1812, they lost 61,964 men, most of whom died of ‘nerve fever’ (typhus\r\nfever).\r\n\r\nIn Vilna, which was greatly overcrowded, typhus fever raged furiously.\r\nThe large number of sick and exhausted soldiers that were left behind,\r\nowing to the extreme cold (the thermometer went down as low as –28°\r\nRéaumur) sought shelter, partly in private houses, and partly in\r\nhospitals. The latter, for the first few days after the arrival of the\r\nRussians, were in a terrible condition; sick men and dead men were\r\npacked together in the cold, unheated rooms, the former lying on rotten\r\nstraw, completely deserted, and without care or nourishment. The\r\ncorridors and courts were filled with dead bodies and with refuse of all\r\nkinds, while in the rooms themselves there was no less filth, since\r\nnobody removed the excrements. ‘The courts and corridors of the\r\nhospitals’, says Gasc, an eye-witness,[119] ‘were so covered with dead\r\nbodies that it was necessary to walk over heaps of them in order to\r\nenter the rooms.’\r\n\r\nNot until after the Emperor of Russia arrived in Vilna was some\r\nsemblance of order restored. But it was then too late; almost all the\r\npatients in the hospitals were infected with typhus fever, and according\r\nto Gasc and Lemazurier the great majority of the 30,000 French prisoners\r\ndied. For owing to the long series of extreme hardships which the\r\nsoldiers had undergone, the disease broke out in its most severe form,\r\ncausing wild delirium, very large petechiae, abscesses, and gangrene.\r\nMany patients succumbed within twenty-four hours, and recovery was very\r\nslow for those who survived the attack.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the disease spread throughout the city, not so much\r\nbecause the soldiers were quartered in private houses, as because the\r\nJews got possession of the clothes of the dead. Of some 30,000 Jewish\r\ninhabitants no less than 8,000 died. In February and March all classes\r\nof society, even the wealthiest people, were attacked. The disease also\r\nspread to the surrounding country; Lemazurier says that between the\r\nmiddle of 1812 and the beginning of 1813 some 55,000 bodies were buried\r\nin Vilna and vicinity, and that the estimates made in Wittepsk,\r\nSmolensk, and Moscow were in proportion. The pestilence spread southward\r\nand eastward, and according to Faure, in February 1813 thousands of\r\nFrench prisoners died in the overcrowded hospitals in Orel. The same\r\nwriter says that all of the French soldiers who fell into the hands of\r\nthe Russians succumbed to typhus fever.[120] We may safely assume that\r\nthe civil inhabitants of all places in that part of the country were\r\nalso attacked, even though we have no figures or statistics to confirm\r\nthe assumption.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence also raged extensively in the region of the Baltic Sea;\r\nSt. Petersburg was severely attacked by it. According to Parrot,[121] in\r\nthe last months of the year 1812 there were a great many cases of ‘nerve\r\nfever’ in Dorpat; in Riga the military hospitals were overcrowded, and\r\nout of a population of 36,000 and a garrison of 20,000 there were 5,000\r\nsick. The mortality in the hospitals was very high, since, on account of\r\nthe extreme cold, two-thirds of the small windows were covered with\r\nboards and hay.\r\n\r\nRegarding conditions in Warsaw we have more detailed information.\r\nAccording to Wolf,[122] two distinct epidemics raged there after the end\r\nof December 1812; the one was an epidemic of typhus fever (probably\r\ntyphoid) and appeared only among the soldiers; the other was an epidemic\r\nof typhus fever, which did not attain to epidemic dimensions until\r\nJanuary 1813, although a few isolated cases had been observed in Warsaw\r\nin the last months of the year 1812. ‘This disease was almost invariably\r\naccompanied by a spotted exanthema, which, if the disease was at first\r\nrather difficult to diagnose, often gave the first clue. In the case of\r\nmany people the eruption was so severe and so general, appearing even on\r\nthe face, that it resembled measles.’ The comparison with measles was\r\nalso drawn by other observers. Typhus fever was conveyed to Warsaw by\r\nthe Austrian auxiliary corps, and it quickly spread to the French\r\nhospitals, which were in a wretched condition. Later the Russian army\r\nalso brought typhus fever to the city. A great many civilians in Warsaw\r\ncontracted the disease; according to Wolf, the epidemic reached its\r\nclimax in February, and lasted until the end of the year 1813. The lower\r\nclasses suffered more than the upper classes from the disease, which,\r\nmoreover, seems to have raged much more furiously in the vicinity of\r\nWarsaw than in the city itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n     3. THE APPEARANCE OF TYPHUS FEVER IN NORTH AND CENTRAL GERMANY\r\n\r\nOn the return march from Moscow to Vilna the remnants of the army had\r\nall taken the same route; for, though all bonds of discipline were\r\nloosened as far back as Smolensk, nevertheless the instinct of\r\nself-preservation kept all the soldiers from abandoning the common line\r\nof march. This was also the case during the march from Vilna to the\r\nNiemen, where the extreme cold caused untold suffering. After crossing\r\nthe river, however, the few unfortunate soldiers who had survived the\r\nawful misery of the march, hungry, clothed in rags, with torn shoes,\r\nalive with vermin, with frozen and gangrenous limbs, scattered in all\r\ndirections, some going home, and others to strongholds that were in the\r\nhands of the French. Thus typhus fever, with which all parts of the army\r\nwere infected, was spread in a comparatively short time over a large\r\npart of Germany.\r\n\r\nAt first the eastern provinces of Prussia, through which these remnants\r\nof the army passed, were attacked by the pestilence; owing to the fact\r\nthat so many were infected, measures of precaution were everywhere\r\nfutile. ‘Adynamic fever’, says Kerckhoffs,[123] ‘spread also among the\r\ncivilians, who were not only afflicted by the terrible scourge of our\r\npassing armies, but also became the victims of a murderous contagion. It\r\nwas a fatal present which we gave them, and which caused such a high\r\nmortality among the inhabitants of the country through which we passed.\r\nWherever we went, the inhabitants were filled with terror and refused to\r\nquarter the soldiers.’ In the more distant parts of Germany, in the\r\nwestern provinces of Prussia, in Bavaria, Baden, and Württemberg, where\r\npeople had perceived the danger, it was easier, in the first months of\r\n1813, to guard against the dissemination of typhus fever, since the\r\nnumber of returning soldiers was small and it was accordingly feasible\r\nto enforce orders regarding quarantine. With the approach of spring the\r\ndisease began to abate a little even in the north and east; in the month\r\nof April it had almost entirely disappeared from the French troops\r\nthere, while in May and June the condition of health among them,\r\naccording to Kerckhoffs, was very good. But in July typhus fever broke\r\nout again, and since the Russian army was also infected with it, the\r\ndisease became uncommonly widespread throughout Saxony and Silesia\r\nduring the months of fighting that ensued. After the battle of Leipzig,\r\nwhen southern and western Germany were overrun by French fugitives and\r\nprisoners, typhus fever once more broke out in that part of the country\r\nwith greater severity than ever before; even in the province of\r\nBrandenburg and in the adjacent regions the pestilence raged, having\r\nbeen borne thither by French prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn Lithuania, and East and West Prussia, typhus fever raged extensively\r\nin the winter of 1812–13. According to H. A. Göden,[124] who had charge\r\nof a large military lazaret in Gumbinnen, the epidemic spread\r\ncontinuously from the border of Russia to Berlin. ‘It appeared most\r\nvirulently’, he says, ‘in the cities of Gumbinnen, Insterburg, Tilsit,\r\nKönigsberg, Elbing, Marienwerder, Konitz, and Landsberg; it followed\r\nalong the military roads, and broke out most severely in the\r\nhalting-places and in those cities where French military lazarets were\r\nestablished.’ In Gumbinnen typhus fever broke out suddenly in the latter\r\npart of November, immediately after the arrival of the fugitives, and\r\nspread rapidly. At first it appeared in houses where officers and\r\nsoldiers were quartered; as a rule, several members of a family\r\ncontracted the disease simultaneously, and only rarely was one member\r\nspared. The pestilence raged most furiously in the months of January and\r\nFebruary; the town had some 6,000 inhabitants, and frequently 20, 30, or\r\n40 people, including entire families, died in a single day. In the\r\nmilitary lazarets the mortality was considerably higher. In March the\r\npestilence began to abate, and in May it disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nIn Königsberg the pestilence began in the month of December 1812 and\r\ncame to an end in May 1813; excluding the soldiers who died in the\r\nmilitary lazarets, the following deaths were recorded there:\r\n\r\n                          December (1812) 430\r\n                          January (1813)  581\r\n                          February        802\r\n                          March           622\r\n                          April           608\r\n                          May             327\r\n                          June            196\r\n                          July            178\r\n                          August          157\r\n                          September       160\r\n                          October         151\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812 there were 2,648 deaths in Königsberg, whereas in the\r\nfollowing year there were 4,403. In the first part of January, when the\r\ncity was evacuated by the French, 10,000 people, according to Stricker,\r\nwere left behind. The entire province of East Prussia, according to\r\nGurlt, lost 20,000 inhabitants by typhus fever.[125]\r\n\r\nDanzig, which was besieged by the Russians from January 11 to November\r\n29, 1813, suffered terribly. A French army of 35,900 men, under General\r\nRapp, was in the city, and during the siege it was exposed to all sorts\r\nof privations as well as to extreme cold. As early as February typhus\r\nfever had become very widespread; from January to May, 11,400 soldiers\r\ndied in the hospitals (4,000 in March alone), while 5,592 inhabitants\r\nsuccumbed to the disease in the course of the entire year.[126]\r\n\r\nSilesia was hit extremely hard. The pestilence was conveyed there in the\r\nmonths of October, November, and December 1812 by transports of Russian\r\nprisoners, and it appeared in Trebnitz, Striegau, Krottkau,\r\nFriedenwalde, Trachenberg, Breslau, Parchwitz, Quaritz, &c. The officers\r\non duty, the persons who lifted the patients from the wagons, the\r\nphysicians, and the sick-attendants were always the first to be\r\ninfected.[127] With the opening of spring the disease disappeared, but\r\nbroke out anew after the battle on the Katzbach. In Breslau the disease\r\nappeared in a very virulent form, since the infected soldiers were\r\nhoused there in overcrowded lazarets, which in the month of November\r\ntook in some 6,300 patients daily; numerous physicians (statements vary\r\nbetween 16 and 22) also succumbed to typhus fever. Among the civil\r\ninhabitants, to be sure, the disease did not become very widespread; out\r\nof a population of 62,789, only 3,055 died in the year 1812, 3,095 in\r\nthe year 1813, and 3,301 in the year 1814. From the middle of September\r\n1813 to February 1814, 478 civilians and some 1,800 soldiers succumbed\r\nin Breslau to typhus fever; the total number of soldiers that died\r\nbetween the middle of September and the beginning of March was\r\n3,400.[128] In the governmental district of Liegnitz, having a\r\npopulation of 600,000, according to Kausch[129] only 13 physicians\r\n(excluding the surgeons) died. The disease was borne by transports of\r\ninfected soldiers into other parts of Silesia, and at the end of the\r\nyear 1813 all the military lazarets in Silesia were infected. In\r\nWaldenburg and vicinity (Obersalzbrunn, &c.) typhus fever broke out\r\nafter the soldiers had marched through on October 20 and November 25,\r\n1813, and seventeen days later the disease was very widespread, all the\r\nmembers of many families having contracted it. In Bunzlau typhus fever\r\nraged with unusual fury; in the military lazaret 12,000 men are said to\r\nhave died between June 1813 and March 1814.\r\n\r\nPresently typhus fever appeared, with the arrival of the remnants of the\r\nGrand Army, in regions further away from the Russian border. Häser[130]\r\ndescribes the manner in which the disease spread, always along military\r\nroads, as follows:\r\n\r\n‘French soldiers returning from Russia’, he says, ‘spread the contagion\r\nof various diseases over a large part of Central Europe. Almost naked,\r\nor clothed in torn and half-burned rags, without shoes, their feet\r\ncovered with straw, and their frozen limbs covered with festering sores,\r\nthey marched through Poland and Germany. Typhus fever and other diseases\r\nassociated with it marked their course. The inhabitants of the country\r\nwere forced to house the sick; but teamsters also conveyed the infection\r\nto villages which the soldiers did not visit. The disease raged most\r\nfuriously in the hospitals, which scarcely anywhere were able to meet\r\neven the most modest demands made upon them.’\r\n\r\nRegarding the appearance of typhus fever in Berlin we are informed by\r\nHufeland and Horn.[131] First to occur there (in the months of February\r\nand March 1813) were numerous cases of ‘nervous fever’, which was\r\ndoubtless typhoid fever. Still it is likely that cases of typhus fever\r\nalso occurred at that time, for Horn, in writing about ‘nervous fevers’\r\nin the Charité, describes the exanthema with the same words that\r\nHufeland uses in reference to later cases. Among these patients there\r\nwere already some who had returned from Russia.[132] At all events, in\r\nthe first part of March 1813 there occurred cases of contagious typhus,\r\nwhich was brought to Berlin by French, and later by Russian soldiers;\r\nthe observed ways of infection, regarding which Hufeland informs us, are\r\nmentioned above. In the middle of April there were 246 typhus-fever\r\npatients in the Charité. In order to prevent the disease from spreading\r\nin this hospital, Hufeland adopted strict measures of precaution. The\r\npatients were all carefully isolated on the second floor, which was shut\r\noff by means of a grating. The newly-arrived patients were supplied with\r\nclean, fresh linen, their clothing was disinfected for several days in\r\nhydrochloric acid, and then washed in boiling water containing lye,\r\nwhile objects of no value were burned. The sick-rooms were constantly\r\nventilated by leaving the windows open, and were thoroughly cleaned\r\nevery day. The physicians, surgeons, and attendants, before they entered\r\nthe sick-rooms, had to put on black mantles of glazed linen, and on\r\nleaving the rooms they had to wash their hands and faces in cold water\r\nand rinse out their mouths. In this way the disease was prevented from\r\nspreading in the hospital itself.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Leipzig typhus fever broke out anew in Berlin;\r\naccording to Horn, 144 cases of ‘nerve fever’ were received into the\r\nCharité in January 1814, 92 in February, 54 in March, 14 in April, 8 in\r\nMay, and none in June. Regarding the total mortality in the epidemic of\r\ntyphus fever in Berlin, which in the year 1813 had about 155,000\r\ninhabitants, the following table, compiled by Gurlt,[133] gives us\r\ninformation; there died in:\r\n\r\n                1812.             1813.                   1814.\r\n               _Total      _Total       _From      _Total       _From\r\n              deaths._    deaths._    Typhus._    deaths._    Typhus._\r\n\r\n January             422         500          31         680         170\r\n February            457         544          57         596         118\r\n March               444         740         233         781          85\r\n April               476         719         227         653          55\r\n May                 584         752         184         443          28\r\n June                396         518          85         434          19\r\n July                417         460          29         541          14\r\n August              338         551          20         454           5\r\n September           370         467          22         577          16\r\n October             425         621          34         430          13\r\n November            356         555         105         412          11\r\n December            571         585         157         565          11\r\n                   —————       —————       —————       —————         ———\r\n    Total          5,256       7,012       1,184       6,566         545\r\n\r\nTyphus fever appeared throughout the entire province of Brandenburg.\r\nMaier[134] gives us some information regarding the city of Brandenburg,\r\nwhere ‘infectious nerve-fever’ disappeared in the latter part of May\r\n1813, and where, after the battle of Leipzig, it again broke out, but\r\ndid not become very widespread. On October 27 prisoners from Baden and\r\nHesse were quartered there; they remained until October 31 and then went\r\non to Ruppin. Among them were some convalescents from a military lazaret\r\nin Saxony, who infected the occupants of all the houses in which the\r\nprisoners were quartered. Between November 5 and December 6 there were\r\n38 ‘nerve-fever’ patients in the Altstadt and 7 in the Neustadt, a small\r\nnumber of whom died. Typhus fever raged very furiously in Jüterbog after\r\nthe battle of Dennewitz, carrying away entire families.\r\n\r\nAfter his defeat in Russia, Napoleon had quickly returned to France, and\r\nthere, by means of new conscriptions, had in a short time assembled an\r\narmy of very young men, who had never done military service and were\r\ntherefore not accustomed to the hardships of war and, in particular,\r\nwere much more susceptible to infectious diseases than the troops that\r\nhad served under him before. In April, when the army of the Allies had\r\narrived at the Elbe, Napoleon with his newly-gathered army left the\r\nRhine and marched to Saxony, which from then until autumn was the main\r\nscene of the war. Since the Russian army was still infected with typhus\r\nfever, contracted in the winter campaign, and since, furthermore,\r\nisolated cases of the disease were still occurring among the remnants of\r\nthe French troops that had returned from Russia, the inevitable result\r\nwas that Saxony was not only completely impoverished by the protracted\r\nwar, but was also terribly afflicted by war pestilences.\r\n\r\nIn Saxony typhus fever had already become very widespread in the first\r\nfew months of 1813; all the places through which the military transports\r\npassed were attacked, as Sorau, Guben, Lübben, Görlitz, Leipzig, and\r\nWeissenberg; while places in which military hospitals were erected fared\r\neven worse, as Schneeberg, Zwickau, Chemnitz, Freiberg, and\r\nAugustusburg. The severe epidemic in Annaberg (in the Saxon Erzgebirge),\r\nlasting from March to May 1813, has been described by Neuhof.[135] In\r\nMarch a Saxon field-hospital was established there, and presently\r\neverybody who came in contact with the hospital contracted typhus fever.\r\nIn neighbouring Thum, where the patients passed only one night, many\r\ncitizens succumbed to the disease.\r\n\r\nDresden, in the first few months of the year 1813, was not attacked by\r\nthe disease, notwithstanding the fact that soldiers and officers\r\nreturning from Russia were taken sick and died there; only in rare\r\ninstances were citizens, in whose homes officers had been quartered,\r\nattacked, and the disease did not rage at all extensively.[136] On the\r\nother hand, typhus fever raged furiously in Dresden after Napoleon’s\r\nsuccessful battle at Bautzen (May 20 and 21, 1813), when large numbers\r\nof wounded soldiers were brought to Dresden and placed in lazarets,\r\nwhich soon became greatly overcrowded. The less-severely wounded were\r\nhoused in the homes of citizens, who were compelled to receive them and\r\nsuffered terribly in consequence of it. The result was that typhus fever\r\nspread from the soldiers to the civilians. After the battle of Dresden\r\n(August 26, 27), from which Napoleon again emerged victorious, but\r\nespecially during the short siege of Dresden (from the middle of October\r\nto November 11), the epidemic increased in both extent and fury. The\r\nincreased mortality is shown by the following table, which includes only\r\nthe residents:\r\n\r\n                             January   184\r\n                             February  199\r\n                             March     188\r\n                             April     194\r\n                             May       289\r\n                             June      257\r\n                             July      264\r\n                             August    474\r\n                             September 882\r\n                             October   659\r\n                             November  960\r\n                             December  944\r\n\r\nAccording to Fischer, one person out of every ten that contracted the\r\ndisease died, while the mortality in the French military hospitals was\r\nincredibly high. In the course of the year 1813 no less than 21,090\r\nsoldiers died in Dresden, while in the same year 5,194 residents died;\r\n3,273 civilians died in the year 1814, and 1,785 in the year 1815. The\r\naverage number of deaths per annum among the civil inhabitants was\r\n2,304.\r\n\r\nRegarding the terrible conditions in Dresden at that time, a pastor\r\ninforms us in a letter:[137]\r\n\r\n\r\n  It was a gruesome sight to see the wagons full of naked corpses,\r\n  thrown together in the most horrible positions, drive away from the\r\n  hospitals and set out for their destination. Many bodies are said to\r\n  have been cast into the Elbe. The terrible days began about the\r\n  middle of May, when many house-owners were obliged to quarter as\r\n  many as two, three, and even four hundred men. Presently persons\r\n  suffering from wounds, scurvy, and infectious disease began to\r\n  arrive from Bautzen, some straggling along piteously on foot, others\r\n  being rolled along in ghastly groups on pushcarts. This\r\n  disease-spreading mass was now housed in the homes of citizens,\r\n  since the twenty-five hospitals were no longer able to accommodate\r\n  them. The houses, yards, streets, and public squares were full of\r\n  dirt and refuse. Dearth of food, resulting from the breakdown of\r\n  means of supply, added to the general misery. Entire families were\r\n  wiped out, and many houses are still standing empty (1814). Wagons\r\n  bearing the dead clattered on all the streets, and there were few\r\n  inhabitants who did not wear some outward sign of mourning for lost\r\n  relatives.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeipzig suffered even greater hardships. The pestilence was conveyed\r\nthither by French soldiers in February 1813, and on the 27th of that\r\nmonth there were thirty-eight fever patients in the Jacobsspital. In the\r\nsummer of 1813, when the war was going on in Saxony, the disease raged\r\nthere furiously. After the battle of Dresden a large percentage of the\r\nwounded were brought to Leipzig, and more than 20,000 sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers were kept there for several months. As usual, typhus fever\r\nbroke out in the city in consequence of it, and carried away large\r\nnumbers of soldiers and citizens. After the battle of Leipzig upwards of\r\n30,000 wounded soldiers, mostly Frenchmen, were housed in the city.\r\n‘Virulent nerve-fever,’ says Beitzke,[138] ‘which had been prevalent in\r\nthe city for some time, now broke out with tenfold severity, not only in\r\nthe city itself, but also in the surrounding country, and carried away\r\nlarge numbers of people. The arrival of the cold weather, which helped\r\nto check the disease, was under these circumstances a great blessing.’\r\nIn the year 1813 some 80,000 French soldiers, according to the hospital\r\nlists, succumbed to wounds, war-typhus, and other diseases, in Leipzig.\r\nFrom February 1813 to January 1814, seventeen young physicians died\r\nthere of typhus fever. The number of civilians buried in Leipzig in the\r\nyear 1813 was 3,499, in the year 1814 it was 2,022; the average number\r\nof interments in the years 1810–12 was 1,443, and in the years 1815–17\r\nit was 1,187. The number buried (including the still-births, but not the\r\nsoldiers) was, by months:[139]\r\n\r\n                                   1813. 1814.\r\n                         January      98   450\r\n                         February    121   276\r\n                         March       206   244\r\n                         April       202   152\r\n                         May         178   159\r\n                         June        200   120\r\n                         July        290    85\r\n                         August      189   107\r\n                         September   176   118\r\n                         October     311   111\r\n                         November    743    96\r\n                         December    785   104\r\n\r\nMost of those carried away were adults; the following table indicates\r\nthe relation between the age of the victims and the mortality:\r\n\r\n                   _Years of Age._ 1812. 1813. 1814.\r\n                   1                 356   517   456\r\n                   1–10              161   310   305\r\n                   10–20              29   174    76\r\n                   20–30              91   362   157\r\n                   30–40              87   492   173\r\n                   40–50             104   559   207\r\n                   50–60             126   409   208\r\n                   60–70             124   358   234\r\n                   Over 70           119   256   155\r\n\r\nIn reference to the year 1813, in which typhus fever caused the greatest\r\ndevastation in Leipzig, we see how the mortality among persons between\r\nthe ages of ten and sixty increased between fourfold and fivefold, while\r\namong very young children and very old men, it increased by at most one\r\nhundred per cent. In the year 1813 more men than women died (1,900 men\r\nand 1,599 women), whereas in the following year the reverse was the case\r\n(1,009 men and 1,013 women).\r\n\r\nTyphus fever spread throughout all Saxony. In Plauen, which was at that\r\ntime a city of 6,800 inhabitants, the following number of deaths,\r\naccording to Flinzer,[140] were due to typhus fever: 4 in 1812, 32 in\r\n1813, 59 in 1814, and 5 in 1815. These figures do not include the\r\nforeign soldiers that died. According to Flinzer, the specific disease\r\nbefore the year 1819 was usually typhus fever. In the year 1814 the\r\ntotal number of deaths in Plauen increased to 440.\r\n\r\nNumerous sick, wounded, and captive soldiers were quartered in Zwickau\r\nafter the battle of Leipzig. There and in the surrounding villages, in\r\nconsequence of the erection of a hospital, typhus fever had already\r\nappeared in September, but in Zwickau itself, thanks to timely measures\r\nof precaution, it gained no headway. In the year 1812 only 183 civilians\r\ndied there, 376 in the year 1813, and 260 in the year 1814; 380 soldiers\r\ndied there in 1813, and 14 in the year 1814.[141]\r\n\r\nThe pestilences spread all over the country, even into the most remote\r\ncorners of the Saxon Erzgebirge; Annaberg and the neighbouring towns of\r\nMarienberg, Weipert, and Geyer were again attacked, although less\r\nseverely, according to Neuhof, than in the spring. In March the disease\r\ndisappeared entirely.\r\n\r\nThe Saxon strongholds along the Elbe fared worst of all; regarding the\r\nterrible devastation caused by typhus fever in Torgau we shall have\r\nsomething to say in the tenth chapter. Magdeburg and Merseburg were also\r\nseverely attacked; this is evident from the fact that one-half of the\r\nphysicians in Magdeburg (nine in number) succumbed, according to Roloff,\r\nto hospital fever.[142] In Wittenberg, whither typhus fever was borne in\r\nFebruary 1813 by infected French soldiers, and where it had subsequently\r\ndisappeared, the mortality was very high during the siege, which lasted\r\nfrom October 28, 1813, to January 14, 1814; of 6,000 or 7,000\r\ninhabitants, upwards of 4,000 had left the city before the siege began.\r\nIn the course of seven months (July 1813 to January 1814) 590 people\r\ndied there, whereas the average number of deaths had been only 300 per\r\nannum. When the city was captured by the Prussians the death-rate\r\nincreased; no less than 331 persons died between January 14 and April\r\n14, 1814.[143]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Leipzig the defeated army marched back through\r\nWeissenfels, Naumburg, Weimar, and Erfurt to the Main. There was now no\r\nactive effort made to supply food to the army, which still numbered some\r\n100,000 men; the soldiers had to eat whatever they could pick up along\r\nthe way. ‘Extreme misery and exhaustion’, says Beitzke,[144] ‘led to\r\ngreat excesses; the places along the route were made to suffer, and\r\nworst of all, the region through which the French army hurried back was\r\ngenerally infected with the germ of typhus fever.’ ‘The route of the\r\narmy, clear to Mayence,’ says Giraud,[145] ‘was again strewn with\r\ncorpses and débris.’\r\n\r\nIn Weissenfels some 3,000 soldiers are said to have died in the\r\nhospitals, and also 600 civilians, within a year. In Altenburg, which\r\nhad suffered from typhus fever in the spring of 1813, 1,650 men and 55\r\nofficers died between October 2 and December 1 of that year. In\r\nEisenberg (in Saxe-Altenburg), according to Greiner,[146] a lazaret was\r\nestablished in the fall of 1813, but there were but few cases of typhus\r\nfever transmitted to citizens owing to the adoption of all measures of\r\nprecaution. On the other hand, the disease was conveyed to numerous\r\nnear-by villages, in which large numbers of sick and convalescent\r\nsoldiers were quartered. ‘The Cossacks did the most toward spreading the\r\ndisease, for wherever any of them were quartered, one could count with\r\ncertainty upon an early outbreak of nerve-fever.’ In November 1813, a\r\nsevere epidemic of typhus fever broke out in Gera, and the mortality in\r\nfour months was seven times as high as usual. In Zeulenroda (south of\r\nGera) the pestilence was not very severe; it was brought there by sick\r\nand convalescent soldiers, who were quartered in the houses.[147] Jena,\r\non the other hand, was very severely attacked: the epidemic began in\r\nNovember 1813, and lasted until March 1814.[148] According to Gurlt, the\r\nusual number of deaths in normal years in the districts of Weimar and\r\nJena was from 1,750 to 1,850; but in the year 1813 no less than 3,948\r\npeople died there, and in 1814 there were 3,363 deaths.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Lützen (May 2, 1813) some 8,000 wounded French and\r\nPrussian soldiers came to Erfurt, necessitating the immediate erection\r\nof lazarets. After the battles in August, when the scene of the war\r\nmoved closer to Erfurt, the misery in the city was greatly increased,\r\nresulting in a rapid dissemination of typhus fever. In the latter part\r\nof August, when 9,000 sick and convalescent soldiers arrived in the\r\ncity, the citizens were obliged to quarter them; the number of soldiers\r\nthat succumbed to typhus fever was appalling, while as many as 17\r\ncivilians often died in a single day; in the week before the battle of\r\nLeipzig 504 soldiers died in the hospitals. On October 20–23 the French\r\nlazarets were cleaned out as thoroughly as possible. During the siege,\r\nwhich began on October 25 and lasted seventy-three days, the misery was\r\nextreme, and typhus fever raged more and more furiously. From November 1\r\nto November 17 some 400 civilians died, while no less than 1,472\r\nsoldiers died in the military hospitals; 143 soldiers died on December 9\r\nand 10. The houses of a few citizens were rendered absolutely\r\ntenantless. In the year 1813 Erfurt lost 1,585 citizens, as compared\r\nwith an average of 554 for the years 1811–12; the number of deaths in\r\nthe year 1814 was 1,121. Typhus fever also raged so furiously among the\r\nPrussian besiegers, that the lazarets were soon overcrowded, and it was\r\nnecessary to house the troops in other places.[149]\r\n\r\nIn Fulda, which was forced to take in thousands of sick soldiers, typhus\r\nfever soon began to spread rapidly, as it also did in the country\r\nsurrounding the city. In Giessen, where a Russian field-lazaret for\r\n1,800–2,000 men was erected, the epidemic soon spread to the civil\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAt Hanau the French retreat was opposed by General Wrede with an army of\r\n50,000 Bavarians and Austrians, a much smaller number than the French\r\nhad. The two days of fighting that ensued (October 30 and 31, 1813)\r\ncaused the pestilence to develop murderously. Kopp has given us a good\r\ndescription of this epidemic in Hanau.[150] Since the beginning of the\r\nwar the city had always had a military hospital, which lay outside the\r\ncity. During the battles in Saxony the number of sick and wounded\r\nincreased, so that it was necessary to erect a second lazaret within the\r\ncity. Many sick-attendants and sub-surgeons contracted typhus fever,\r\nwhich was prevalent in the hospitals, and several cases also occurred in\r\nthe city, especially among people who quartered soldiers for money in\r\ntheir homes; many soldiers were thus crowded together in small rooms,\r\nand among them were a great many convalescents from Saxon hospitals. The\r\ninfectious nature of the disease and its consequent dangerousness was\r\nshown by the fact that as a rule entire families gradually contracted\r\nit, although the epidemic was confined to individual houses. The\r\nengagement at Hanau, from which the French emerged victorious, resulted\r\nin the unfortunate city being stormed and plundered. ‘Even while the\r\nbattle was going on,’ says Kopp, ‘a corps of the French army scattered\r\nthroughout Hanau. This corps had brought with it from Saxony the germ of\r\ninfection; for the region around Dresden could be looked upon as the\r\ngreat breeding-place where, in view of the enormous assemblage of people\r\nrepresenting so many nations, and owing to the concurrence of so many\r\nunusual factors, the soil was uncommonly fertile for pestilential\r\ndiseases.’ After the engagement a multitude of French prisoners, greatly\r\nweakened by hardships and hunger, came to the city. The dissemination of\r\ntyphus fever was especially helped along by the fact that many poor\r\ninhabitants engaged in looting on the battlefield, and took home with\r\nthem the knapsacks and other effects of the dead. The clothing of the\r\ndead came into the possession of those who were charged with burying\r\nthem, and later got into the hands of the poorest families in the city\r\nand in the neighbouring villages. ‘I often entered the houses of poor\r\npeople,’ Kopp goes on to say, ‘and found the entire family suffering\r\nfrom typhus fever, and on the walls of the low sick-room the uniforms,\r\nshirts, and other effects of the dead soldiers would still be hanging.’\r\nThe result was that the number of patients greatly increased after the\r\nbattle, and in less than two weeks an epidemic began to develop; at\r\nfirst it was rather mild, but later on it carried away large numbers of\r\npeople, and lasted until the end of February, having reached its climax\r\nin December. From December 1, 1813, to January 4, 1814, 248 people died,\r\nwhereas the normal mortality for the month of December was but 30. The\r\ntotal number of deaths, including the soldiers, between October 26 and\r\nMarch 1 was 613, while in ordinary years only 125 people died, on the\r\naverage. The middle class suffered worst of all, while of the upper\r\nclasses three physicians and several clergymen died. Of the 192\r\ntyphus-fever patients that Kopp himself treated, 21 died (10·9 per\r\ncent), but these figures do not include a rather large number of very\r\nmild cases. People of all ages and both sexes were attacked; children\r\nsuffered less than adults, while old people and heavy drinkers were the\r\nmost liable to succumb. The disease lasted from two to three weeks;\r\ndeath usually occurred on the fourteenth to twentieth day, often\r\nsomewhat sooner.\r\n\r\nFrankfurt-on-the-Main suffered terribly in the year 1813 from enforced\r\nquartering. Even in the spring, after the newly-organized French armies\r\nhad passed through the city, the Frankfurt lazarets were overcrowded\r\nwith sick and wounded soldiers from Saxony, which was then the scene of\r\nthe war. Accordingly it was decided in Frankfurt to build barracks\r\nadapted to the expected requirements; and in order to protect the city\r\nas much as possible from the infection of typhus fever, the barracks\r\nwere erected outside the city limits, before the Allerheiligen Tor, and\r\nwere situated in the Pfingstweide along the Main. The building of these\r\nbarracks was a large and very expensive undertaking, but they\r\nundoubtedly served a very useful purpose by protecting the inhabitants\r\nfor a considerable length of time against the infection of typhus\r\nfever.’[151] On September 21 and 22 large numbers of sick and wounded\r\nsoldiers came to Frankfurt; they filled all the lazarets, and many of\r\nthem had to be quartered in the homes of citizens. From that time on\r\ntyphus fever began to spread throughout the city. Fortunately for\r\nFrankfurt, the retreat of the French army from Hanau to Mayence passed\r\nby the city, since the French generals were afraid that they would be\r\nunable to get their troops out of Frankfurt again. On October 29 all the\r\nsick and wounded French soldiers in the Frankfurt hospitals were taken\r\nout and conveyed by boat to Mayence. The hospital on the Pfingstweide,\r\nwhich had room for 1,480 patients, was immediately cleansed and made\r\nready for the army of the Allies, who were marching into Frankfurt in\r\nlarge numbers. Typhus fever now reached its climax. The arrival of the\r\nGerman and Russian armies almost doubled the number of people in the\r\ncity; the soldiers were quartered in the homes of citizens and\r\nimmediately infected them with the pestilence. On January 14, 1814,\r\nthere were more than 4,000 typhus-fever patients in the city alone,\r\nwhile in the district their number far exceeded 6,000. How the mortality\r\namong the civil inhabitants was thereby increased is shown by the\r\nfollowing figures, which include only the deaths in the civil\r\npopulation:\r\n\r\n                           July (1813)     86\r\n                           August          83\r\n                           September       93\r\n                           October        103\r\n                           November       328\r\n                           December       289\r\n                           January (1814) 264\r\n                           February       248\r\n                           March          212\r\n                           April          132\r\n                           May            135\r\n                           June            76\r\n\r\nFour physicians and seven surgeons succumbed to the epidemic in\r\nFrankfurt. Of 668 typhus-fever patients taken in by the Hospital zum\r\nHeiligen Geist, 100 died. Generally speaking, Frankfurt-on-the-Main\r\nfared pretty well, for the reason that most of the patients were housed\r\noutside the city; the lower classes, particularly servants and maids,\r\nsuffered the most. In the city itself the disease was confined chiefly\r\nto the narrow streets of the Altstadt. In March and April the pestilence\r\nbegan gradually to abate, and in May it ceased altogether.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Hanau the retreating French army went on to Mayence and\r\nFrance. The great loss of human life due to typhus fever during the\r\nsiege of Mayence will be discussed in the tenth chapter. Wiesbaden[152]\r\nwas attacked very severely; 800 men are said to have died in the\r\nmilitary lazaret there, while of the native inhabitants, who numbered\r\n4,000 at that time, 466 contracted the disease and 141 succumbed to it.\r\n\r\nFrom Mayence the pestilence spread and infected the Rheingau; the\r\noutbreak in Oestrich (below Hattenheim on the Rhine) is described by\r\nThilenius.[153] In October sick and wounded French soldiers were taken\r\ndown the Rhine, and in the latter part of that month 500 soldiers on\r\nthree boats were held up by a severe storm at Oestrich, where the bad\r\nweather compelled them to remain for twenty-four hours. The patients,\r\ncontrary to orders, left the ships and were taken in by the inhabitants\r\nof Oestrich. Before they went away fourteen of them died; a number had\r\nalready died on the boats. On November 7 five or six citizens of\r\nOestrich contracted the disease; before the 9th more than thirty had\r\nbeen taken sick, and on the 10th there were 93 typhus-fever patients in\r\nthe city. All told, 330 people in Oestrich contracted the disease, and\r\n103 succumbed to it. In the latter part of November neighbouring places\r\nwere infected by dispersed French soldiers, by the small lazarets of the\r\ntroops of the Allies, by visits to the sick, and by participation in\r\nfuneral ceremonies. Particularly hard hit was the town of Kiedrich,\r\nwhere 336 people contracted the disease and 69 succumbed to it.\r\n\r\nAs in Oestrich, so in Winkel (near Rüdesheim), according to J. B. von\r\nFranque, the pestilence broke out on November 5, 1813, when a boat-load\r\nof infected French soldiers was driven ashore there; sixty or seventy of\r\nthe patients entered the village of Winkel, where they were housed in a\r\nschoolroom. Presently a large number of the inhabitants (91 all told)\r\ncontracted the disease, and 31 of them died. In the small neighbouring\r\ncommunity of Espenschied the pestilence broke out in a Prussian military\r\nlazaret and spread to all the houses with the exception of one.\r\n\r\nKraft[154] gives us some interesting information regarding the\r\nappearance of typhus fever in Runkel-on-the-Lahn (above Limburg). This\r\noutbreak affords an example of how quickly the pestilence spread in\r\nsmall places. Shortly after the arrival of the Allies, traces of lazaret\r\nfever revealed themselves there, and in the latter part of November\r\n1813, several sick soldiers were brought there and housed in the homes\r\nof citizens. Presently typhus fever broke out all over the town; in the\r\nfirst part of December the castle at Runkel was converted into a\r\nlazaret, and it was very soon filled with patients. The poor allowed\r\nthemselves to be employed for short periods as sick-attendants, and the\r\nresult was that they either contracted the disease themselves or else\r\nconveyed it to their homes; it was not long before the entire town, as\r\nwell as the surrounding country, was infected. The convalescents from\r\nthe military lazarets were not isolated in separate houses, but taken to\r\nthe surrounding towns and villages (for example, Weyer, Villmar,\r\nMünster, and Erfurt), many of whose inhabitants were taken sick. The\r\npestilence raged far and wide; at the climax of the epidemic (February\r\nto the middle of March) entire families lay sick, and a great many\r\nphysicians and surgeons were attacked; the disease disappeared about the\r\nmiddle of May. In Runkel itself, which had 850 inhabitants, 214\r\ncontracted the disease and 70 died; the total number of deaths between\r\nDecember 1, 1813, and July 1, 1814, was 94, whereas the normal number of\r\ndeaths for an entire year was but 17. In the village of Münster, which\r\nhad 760 inhabitants, 86 were taken sick and 22 died; and in the village\r\nof Weyer, which had 727 inhabitants, 179 were attacked and 58 died; the\r\naverage number of deaths per annum in both villages was 12. As in these\r\nsmall places, so in all the towns and cities the pestilence broke out\r\nwherever a sick soldier of either army passed.\r\n\r\nFrom October 28 on, transports of half-dead typhus-fever patients for\r\nseveral days kept arriving at Limburg itself, where they were sheltered\r\nin a convent. In only eight days several inhabitants living near the\r\nlazaret, and also several sick-attendants and their families, contracted\r\nthe disease. In consequence of the quartering of Russian and Prussian\r\ntroops in the homes of citizens, and also in consequence of the erection\r\nof a permanent hospital in the city, into which hundreds of patients\r\nwere received every day, typhus fever broke out with great severity\r\namong the inhabitants; the climax of the epidemic came in January. Of\r\n600 civilians who contracted the disease 76 died.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Duchy of Nassau, to which the last-named places (Wiesbaden,\r\nOestrich, Rüdesheim, Runkel, and Limburg) belonged, and which had some\r\n270,000 inhabitants, the number of people who contracted the disease and\r\nthe number who died from it, according to the reports of the church and\r\ntown authorities, was recorded for the period between October 1, 1813,\r\nand April 1, 1814. According to von Franque, the following figures were\r\ncompiled in reference to the civil population in the Governmental\r\nDistricts of that time:\r\n\r\n   _Governmental         _Due to Typhus Fever._        _No. Deaths from\r\n    District._                                           all causes._\r\n         〃          _No. Patients._    _No. Deaths._           〃\r\n Ehrenbreitstein              11,522             2,409             3,680\r\n Weilburg                      2,173               419               680\r\n Wiesbaden                    29,349             6,179             8,099\r\n                              ——————             —————            ——————\r\n       Total                  43,044             9,007            12,459\r\n\r\nAltogether, fourteen per cent of the population were attacked by typhus\r\nfever, and three per cent succumbed to it; scarcely a single community\r\nwas spared.\r\n\r\nEpidemics of typhus fever also occurred further down the Rhine; Coblenz,\r\nfor instance, was severely attacked. According to Bernstein,[155] a\r\nsmall epidemic broke out in Neuwied in January 1814, having been borne\r\nthither by a Prussian corps under General Kleist, which left behind\r\neighty-two sick soldiers, many of them suffering from ‘nerve-fever’. The\r\ndisease spread in a rather mild form throughout the city, but lasted\r\nonly four weeks.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever likewise appeared in North Germany, which was not directly\r\ninfected by French soldiers retreating from Leipzig. Hamburg was\r\nattacked with great severity. In March 1813, the Russian colonel,\r\nTettenborn, by means of a bold _coup de main_ had captured Hamburg, but\r\nhe was unable to hold it, and on May 30 the French returned. Marshal\r\nDavoust erected strong fortifications and drove out all the poorer\r\ninhabitants, most of whom had come from the neighbouring Altona, and\r\nthus made ready for a long siege, which did not begin until the end of\r\nthe year, although the blockade was complete by the middle of January.\r\nLarge quantities of filth accumulated in the streets, since all\r\nworking-men were employed at the redoubts and hospitals. Food became\r\nmore and more scarce. ‘On such a fertile soil’, says Th. Deneke,[156]\r\n‘typhus fever flourished. The disease spread rapidly from the hospitals\r\nthroughout the entire city, since not only were all arrangements wanting\r\nfor the isolation of the patients, but half-recovered patients were\r\nactually discharged from the hospital and quartered in the homes of\r\ncitizens. Of the garrison, which at the beginning of the siege numbered\r\nsome 25,000 or 30,000 men, sixty or seventy, at one time as many as 100,\r\ndied every day between the first part of February and the last part of\r\nMarch, and they were all buried outside the Steintor, close by the\r\ntown-moat. No less than 10,700 bodies were interred there, 8,200 people\r\nhaving succumbed to typhus fever, and 2,500 to wounds; among those\r\nburied were numerous prisoners. Regarding the number of inhabitants that\r\ndied we have no information. The condition in the hospitals must have\r\nbeen terrible; since there was not sufficient room or the proper\r\nfacilities to take care of the patients, the physicians and attendants\r\ndid their duty only under constraint, and the managing officials in many\r\ninstances grossly abused their authority; one of them, the director of\r\nthe Legert Military Hospital, for example, ended characteristically by\r\nbecoming in 1824 the leader of a band of robbers in France.’ Seven\r\nphysicians fell victims to the pestilence in Hamburg. The city did not\r\nsurrender until May, after the capture of Paris, whereupon typhus fever\r\nappears to have disappeared quickly.\r\n\r\nFrom Hamburg typhus fever was conveyed by fugitives in all directions;\r\nAltona was attacked with particular severity. As mentioned above,\r\nthousands of the poor driven from Hamburg had been received in Altona.\r\n‘The people, driven from their homes by fear,’ says Steinheim,[157]\r\n‘streamed through our gates and went about seeking shelter. At the same\r\ntime the gates of Hamburg were closed, and swarms of unhappy people, the\r\ndregs of Hamburg’s population, straggled with the sad remnants of their\r\nproperty, bent over more by sorrow than by the weight of their burden,\r\nthrough our gates and found protection, nourishment, and shelter in our\r\nhomes; it was a heart-rending sight.[106] They were housed, partly in\r\nbarracks, stables, and barns, and partly in the houses of the\r\nlower-class citizens, whose homes were thereby ‘so crammed full that not\r\na single corner was left unoccupied by some poor stranger’. More than\r\n17,000 refugees were received in Altona, whose normal population at that\r\ntime amounted to some 24,000. At the beginning of January, when the very\r\ncold weather came (the thermometer often went down as low as –20 degrees\r\nRéaumur), all the cracks and openings in the doors and windows were\r\nstopped up to prevent the entrance of the outside air. In the latter\r\npart of December 1813, typhus fever broke out in these overcrowded\r\nquarters and carried away large numbers of people. The exact number is\r\nunknown; according to Mutzenbecher 1,138 fugitives, all told, died in\r\nAltona. According to other reports sixty-eight per cent of the patients\r\nin the hospital succumbed. The epidemic reached its climax in March, and\r\nwith the coming spring it began to abate, partly because it became\r\nfeasible to house the fugitives in better quarters, and partly because\r\nthe warmer weather rendered better ventilation possible.\r\n\r\nThe disease was also conveyed from Hamburg to Eppendorf, but no\r\ninformation regarding the number of deaths there is available.\r\n\r\nIn Lübeck typhus fever broke out in March 1814, among refugees from\r\nHamburg, and carried away 613 people. According to Gurlt, typhus fever\r\nwas conveyed to Bremen, partly by the army of the Crown Prince of\r\nSweden, and partly by fugitives from Hamburg; the epidemic is said to\r\nhave been rather mild.\r\n\r\nIn Mecklenburg typhus fever began to spread after the erection of a\r\nmilitary lazaret in Malchow (October, 1813), and after the erection of a\r\nsecond lazaret by the Swedes in Wittenburg (near Schwerin).\r\n\r\nIn Kiel typhus fever did not appear until the beginning of the year\r\n1814; Weber[158] attributed the outbreak there to the Swedish military\r\nlazaret, in which physicians and nurses frequently contracted the\r\ndisease. At first the poorer people were attacked (probably because the\r\nsick-attendants were of that class), and later the well-to-do. The\r\npestilence, mild at first, soon became very severe. The disease also\r\nbroke out in other places in Holstein; Pinneberg was severely attacked,\r\nand the disease was also observed in Schleswig. It is remarkable that,\r\naccording to Weber, no exanthema was observed in Kiel; it must, however,\r\nhave been present in a scarcely noticeable form, since a rash appeared\r\non the entire skin of convalescents. The disease always began with a\r\nchill, and was characterized now by obstinate constipation, now by\r\ndiarrhoea; no patient who survived the thirteenth day died. And even if\r\nan exanthema was not observed, there can be no doubt that it was typhus\r\nfever which raged in Kiel. Weber himself calls the disease contagious\r\ntyphus.\r\n\r\n\r\n           4. THE APPEARANCE OF TYPHUS FEVER IN SOUTH GERMANY\r\n\r\nTyphus fever was conveyed to various places throughout South Germany by\r\nthe few soldiers that returned from Russia. Nowhere did it become very\r\nwidespread, since the authorities soon realized its dangers and\r\nprevented it from spreading by means of appropriate measures of\r\nprecaution. A change took place, however, after the battle of Leipzig,\r\nwhen large numbers of fugitive and captive French soldiers came into the\r\ncountry, and when troops, particularly Russians, kept constantly\r\nmarching back and forth across the country and spreading the infection.\r\nAnother important cause of the appearance of the disease there was the\r\nfact that lazarets were erected in South Germany during the campaign in\r\nFrance, for the purpose of sheltering the sick and wounded soldiers that\r\nwere transported back from France.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dissemination of typhus fever in Bavaria we are very well\r\ninformed in a dissertation by F. Seitz.[159] As among other divisions of\r\ntroops, so also among the Bavarian division, typhus fever raged\r\nextensively. On the march from the Vistula to the Oder thirty or forty\r\nmen contracted the disease every day, and some of them also suffered\r\nfrom diarrhoea, dysentery, and other diseases; so that when\r\nCrossen-on-the-Oder was reached only 113 officers and 2,253 men were\r\nleft. During the sojourn in Crossen and during the march through Saxony\r\nin March, the number of the patients increased, and by the middle of\r\nMarch there were only 1,000 able-bodied men left. Thus they arrived at\r\nthe Bavarian border. ‘The rumour of the wide prevalence of nerve-fever\r\nin North Germany,’ says Seitz, ‘and the apprehension that the disease\r\nmight be conveyed into Bavaria by soldiers returning from the field of\r\nbattle, had preceded the arrival of the first warriors. Nevertheless\r\npeople did not wish to forgo the pleasure of sheltering in their homes\r\nthe soldiers, who had been exposed to so many hardships and privations,\r\nand of helping them to forget their past troubles; and in performing\r\nthis philanthropic duty they lost sight of the necessary caution which\r\nprudence demanded.’\r\n\r\nThe infection of an entire family in Regensburg by a soldier discharged\r\nfrom the hospital (in February 1813), and reports regarding infection in\r\nother places, resulted in the adoption of strict measures in the\r\nborder-towns. All returning soldiers, if it was suspected that they were\r\ninfected with disease, were examined by a commission, and if the\r\nsuspicion was confirmed by this commission, they were not allowed to be\r\nquartered in the homes of citizens, but were obliged to find shelter in\r\nbarracks and lazarets, or in suitable buildings outside the town.\r\nPatients were sent to the military hospitals of Bayreuth, Bamberg, and\r\nPlassenburg (near Kulmbach); as soon as these hospitals were filled up,\r\na new one was erected in Altdorf. Strict isolation of the patients was\r\nenforced, and this prevented the further dissemination of the disease\r\namong the civil inhabitants. To be sure, a few people contracted the\r\ndisease after coming in contact with soldiers; for example, in Amberg,\r\nSulzbach, Burglengenfeld, Grafenau, Cham, Nuremberg, &c. On the other\r\nhand, there were a great many typhus-fever patients in the military\r\nhospitals, especially in Bamberg. There typhus fever caused a high\r\nmortality among the soldiers; but, thanks to strict measures of\r\nprecaution, only a few civilians were taken sick (about 100 out of\r\n20,000 inhabitants), while of several physicians that contracted the\r\ndisease only two succumbed to it. About the middle of the year 1813\r\ntyphus fever disappeared in Bavaria, without having demanded many\r\nvictims. The ‘nerve-fevers’, which were prevalent during the summer (for\r\nexample, in Regensburg from July to September), are not regarded by\r\nSchäfer as contagious, and must be looked upon as cases of typhoid\r\nfever.\r\n\r\nIn November, on the other hand, after the battles near Leipzig and\r\nHanau, typhus fever broke out suddenly in many places in Bavaria, and in\r\nDecember raged furiously. The orders, issued in the spring of 1813,\r\nprohibiting all persons suspected of carrying disease from crossing the\r\nborders could no longer be enforced. Says Seitz:[160] ‘When French\r\nprisoners began to march across the country on their way from Saxony and\r\nWürzburg to Bohemia, the pestilence spread among the inhabitants of the\r\ncities and of the flat lands. Typhus fever raged in its most terrible\r\nform among these poor prisoners of war; many succumbed to it in various\r\nplaces along the route, and thousands died in the hospitals. That the\r\ndisease, which haunted all defeated armies like a ghost, would\r\nnecessarily reap an abundant harvest among them, was clear to every\r\nphysician who observed the physiognomies of these warriors as they were\r\nbeing led away in captivity from the vicinity of their fatherland into\r\nremote regions. Their pale faces and emaciated forms bore witness to\r\nhunger and sorrow, to a long deprivation of the usual necessaries of\r\nlife and to lack of vital energy, to exhaustion caused by the long\r\nmarches from Hanau to Leipzig, when in the ardent struggle to reach\r\ntheir fatherland they had used up their last ounce of strength.\r\nWhosoever was brought by profession, sentiment, or curiosity into\r\ncontact with these unfortunate soldiers sooner or later contracted the\r\ndisease. Physicians, police-officers, servants, national guards (who\r\nwatched over the prisoners), country-people (who carried the patients),\r\nmessengers (who brought food to the soldiers in their quarters), were as\r\na rule the first to be attacked.’\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duchy of Würzburg was next attacked. In Würzburg itself, where\r\nthere were 2,000 or 3,000 French patients in the hospitals, the\r\npestilence broke out furiously wherever the soldiers went. In Miltenburg\r\nmore than 100 persons contracted the disease in the latter part of\r\nDecember; in the district of Mellrichstadt the number of typhus-fever\r\npatients was 429 (121 deaths), and in the district of Bischofsheim there\r\nwere 1,067 patients and 328 deaths. According to Seitz, the number of\r\ndeaths throughout the entire Grand Duchy of Würzburg, which at that time\r\nhad a population of 344,500, was 2,500, while no less than 16,000 people\r\ncontracted the disease. In Nuremberg the pestilence did not become very\r\nwidespread; it broke out in the first part of November and lasted until\r\nthe middle of January; 150 persons, all told, contracted the disease.\r\nDinkelsbühl was severely attacked; in the month of November a large\r\nnumber of French prisoners suffering from typhus fever and diarrhoea\r\nwere housed there in the Carmelite Monastery, and in a short time some\r\n200 of them died. Between the 25th and 30th of November typhus fever\r\nspread to the civil population, and, in a few days, more than 100 people\r\ncontracted the disease and 10 died; the number of patients increased\r\nuntil December 12, and then decreased, until the pestilence disappeared\r\nin the latter part of January; 448 persons, all told, contracted the\r\ndisease and 89 succumbed to it. In the middle of November it was\r\nconveyed by a transport of French prisoners to Bamberg, where it spread\r\nwith such fearful rapidity in the military hospital there, that twenty\r\npersons died every day and all the sick-attendants and medical\r\nassistants contracted it. The disease soon spread throughout the city,\r\neven infecting people who had in no way come in contact with the sick\r\nprisoners. Epidemics of typhus fever were reported in twenty-one\r\nvillages in the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nAll Upper Franconia, through which transports of prisoners were taken to\r\nthe Bohemian border, suffered terribly from the pestilence. The disease\r\nwas first observed in the towns and villages lying to the north of\r\nBamberg, whither it had been conveyed by dispersed troops immediately\r\nafter the battle of Leipzig (in Nordhalben, Hof, and other near-by\r\nvillages). Later on it also appeared in the districts further south. The\r\nregion between Bayreuth and Münchberg was, comparatively speaking, less\r\nseverely attacked. On the other hand, typhus fever raged furiously in\r\nthe military hospital on the Plassenburg, where at the end of December\r\nthere were some 700 persons suffering from the disease. In Kulmbach, a\r\ntown lying at the foot of the mountain, more than 100 persons contracted\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nWhile French prisoners were bringing typhus fever into the country from\r\nthe west, Austrian and Russian troops were also bringing it from the\r\neast. To be sure, the authorities were enjoined to restrict the foreign\r\ntroops to the use of ten military roads that passed through the country,\r\nbut the Austrian and Russian leaders frequently ignored these\r\ninstructions. Consequently the pestilence spread over the entire region,\r\na fact which Seitz confirms with numerous specific instances; regarding\r\nthe extent to which it raged in Munich, he gives us no information.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever was conveyed to Regensburg by French prisoners. ‘Toward the\r\nend of the month [December],’ says Schäfer,[161] ‘typhus fever was\r\nconveyed to Regensburg by French prisoners, some of them sick and some\r\nof them well, but all of them scantily clad and half-starved. They were\r\nquartered in the dance-halls, and those that were sick were taken to a\r\nconvent which had been hastily converted into a hospital. There the\r\ncivil inhabitants, owing to the lack of appropriate arrangements, were\r\nobliged to distribute food among the sick, and the result was that the\r\nfever finally became general. Not until then was the advice which the\r\nphysicians had given at the beginning heeded; they had urged, namely,\r\nthat the patients should be cared for by the hospital-attendants\r\nthemselves, that each one should have his own separate attendant, and\r\nthat only those persons should be allowed to enter the hospital whose\r\npresence was absolutely necessary.’ By February, according to the\r\nofficial report, 308 persons, all told, contracted typhus fever in\r\nRegensburg, and 51 succumbed to it.\r\n\r\nIn Ingolstadt an unusually severe epidemic broke out after the arrival\r\nof the French prisoners. In the first part of December the number of\r\nprisoners that died every day was no less than ninety, but after the\r\nmiddle of the month the mortality was somewhat lower. On December 18\r\nthere were 845 typhus-fever patients in the hospitals, and the number of\r\ndeaths on this day amounted to only twenty-seven. From then to the end\r\nof the month only fifteen or twenty persons died per diem. On December\r\n10 several civilians contracted the disease; on December 18 the number\r\nof civilians suffering from the disease was thirty-six, and about an\r\nequal number on December 30. The total number of deaths among the\r\nprisoners of war amounted to 2,000. Typhus fever also appeared along the\r\nDanube on both sides of Ingolstadt.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the winter, typhus fever was also borne into southern\r\nBavaria by Austrian troops; it broke out in the towns along the military\r\nroad, e.g., in Vöcklabruck, Traunstein, Rosenheim, and Landsberg. Places\r\nwhich the soldiers did not visit were also attacked by the pestilence.\r\nIn Weilheim (west of Lake Starnberg) the disease broke out repeatedly\r\nafter soldiers had marched through the place; up to April 8 no less than\r\n885 persons had contracted the disease there, and some 100 had succumbed\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Seitz, 18,427 cases of the disease and 3,084 deaths\r\nattributable to it were officially recorded in Bavaria between October\r\n1813 and June 1814; the lists kept by the Governmental Districts were\r\nundoubtedly very incomplete, but on the other hand we must assume that\r\nthe contagious and non-contagious ‘nerve-fevers’ (typhus and typhoid)\r\nwere not always distinguished. For the several districts Seitz furnishes\r\nus with the following figures relating to the number of people who\r\ncontracted and succumbed to typhus fever:\r\n\r\n           _The Region of the_ _No. Patients._ _No. Deaths._\r\n           Main                          5,752         1,067\r\n           Rezat                         2,135            32\r\n           Regen                         1,627           290\r\n           Upper Danube                  4,613         1,003\r\n           Lower Danube                  1,338           270\r\n           Salzach                       1,815           259\r\n           Isar                          1,147           163\r\n\r\nThis does not include the number of deaths among the prisoners of war,\r\nnor among the native and foreign soldiers. For the Main region, Seitz\r\nalso furnishes figures relating to the age of the patients; of the 5,752\r\npersons who contracted the disease 453 were children, 1,345 were young\r\nmen and women, 3,657 were of middle age, and 297 were old men and women.\r\n\r\nAs in Bavaria, so also in Württemberg, typhus fever broke out in two\r\nepidemics; the first, which was less extensive and less severe, was\r\ncaused by soldiers returning from Russia, and the second broke out in\r\nconsequence of the passing of troops through the country after the\r\nbattle of Leipzig. According to Elsässer,[162] in the first part of the\r\nyear 1813 there were 165 cases of typhus fever and twenty deaths due to\r\nit reported from fifteen different localities. In the month of July the\r\ndisease disappeared from Württemberg. At the end of the year 1813,\r\nhowever, the disease was again borne into the country, partly by French\r\nprisoners, and partly by Russian soldiers. ‘Throughout Württemberg’,\r\nsays Lohnes,[163] ‘this fever appeared wherever foreign troops had\r\ntarried. Consequently contagious typhus first appeared in the northern\r\nlowlands, while the region around Tübingen and the southern and eastern\r\npart of the country at the beginning did not suffer at all. But in\r\nDecember, when large bodies of troops marched through the highlands, the\r\nsouthern part of Württemberg, these fevers followed the soldiers’ lines\r\nof march. At first it was the French prisoners who carried lazaret-fever\r\nwith them wherever they went, and a very severe form of the disease too;\r\nlater on, these fevers always broke out wherever the Russian soldiers\r\nwent, although very few of the soldiers themselves were infected with\r\nthem. Frequently persons contracted the disease who had no sick soldiers\r\nin their homes. As a rule the disease in such cases was mild, but it was\r\nvery dangerous wherever patients were left or congregated in large or\r\nsmall hospitals.’\r\n\r\nAs early as the month of February, the disease had reached its climax in\r\nWürttemberg; in March it began to abate rapidly, so that in the first\r\npart of the summer only 150 patients could be counted in fifteen\r\nGovernmental Districts. From then until the end of the year it broke out\r\nonly sporadically. Braun,[164] who asserts that more than half of the\r\nphysicians in Württemberg contracted typhus fever, mentions the names\r\nand residences of seventeen physicians who succumbed to it; we see from\r\nthis list that the disease was prevalent throughout all Württemberg. The\r\ndisease was also conveyed to the southern part of Upper Swabia.\r\nAccording to Dillenius, 1,300 sick soldiers were sent in the first part\r\nof the year 1814 from France (especially from Mülhausen in Alsace) to\r\nthe military hospital at Tettnang; twenty-four of them died on the way,\r\nand in the course of the following four months five times as many\r\nsuccumbed to typhus fever in the hospital.[165]\r\n\r\nBaden suffered severely from typhus fever; in Karlsruhe, for instance,\r\ntyphus fever raged from October to December 1813. But Baden suffered\r\nparticularly, for the reason that all the sick soldiers in the Bohemian\r\narmy were sent back there from France. Their number far exceeded all\r\nexpectations, since typhus fever was uncommonly prevalent in the field\r\narmy in France, and the soldiers arriving from there infected the\r\nhospitals. Even when the Austrian and Russian troops marched through the\r\ncountry the number of ‘nerve-fever’ patients was very large. Freiburg im\r\nBreisgau, at that time a city of 9,000 inhabitants, suffered very\r\nseverely in consequence of enforced quartering; some 210,000 soldiers\r\nwere housed in the homes of its citizens. In the garrison lazaret and\r\nuniversity hospital, which together had room for 500 patients, no less\r\nthan 1,200 patients were crowded together in December 1813; almost all\r\nof them were suffering from diarrhoea and typhus, and owing to the lack\r\nof linen they were compelled to lie in their own dirty clothes on sacks\r\nof straw. Every morning two large wagonloads of dead bodies were driven\r\naway for burial. As usual, the pestilence spread to the civil\r\npopulation, carrying away entire families. On October 12, 1813, the\r\nformer Abbey of Thennenbach was converted into a military lazaret, in\r\nwhich two weeks later some 1,200 patients were sheltered, although it\r\nhad adequate room for only 700. Between December 27, 1813, and March\r\n1814, 567 soldiers succumbed there, most of them to typhus and\r\ndysentery. The epidemic reached its climax about the middle of January,\r\nwhen as many as thirty persons died per diem. After the middle of\r\nJanuary the number of deaths rapidly decreased.[166] Northern Baden was\r\nalso attacked. In Mannheim the sick and wounded French soldiers who\r\narrived after the battles of Lützen and Bautzen were led around the city\r\nand taken to Spires. Thus typhus fever did not appear in Mannheim\r\nitself, where the condition of health was subsequently also good. The\r\nstatement of the _Rheinische Merkur_, that out of 13,000 patients in the\r\nmilitary lazarets in Mannheim 3,347 died, according to Gurlt,[167] is\r\nincorrect; the number of deaths was no more than 346.\r\n\r\nRegarding the total number of deaths due to typhus fever in Baden no\r\ninformation is available; at all events it was very large. This is shown\r\nby the fact that in the last part of 1813 and first part of 1814 no less\r\nthan thirty-five physicians and thirty surgeons of the first class fell\r\nvictims to the pestilence.[168]\r\n\r\nIn November 1813, thousands of scattered French prisoners came to\r\nDarmstadt; many of them were suffering from typhus fever, which soon\r\nspread throughout the city. Many places in that part of the present\r\nGrand Duchy of Hesse which lies south of the Main were severely attacked\r\nby the epidemic; as many as 2,000 or 3,000 inhabitants of many places\r\ncontracted the disease. But by July 5, 1814, it had everywhere\r\ndisappeared.[169]\r\n\r\n\r\n 5. TYPHUS FEVER ON THE LEFT BANK OF THE RHINE; FRANCE AND SWITZERLAND\r\n\r\nThe continued retreat of the French army passed from Mayence through\r\nMetz to Paris, and the route of the retreat was marked by patients left\r\nbehind. In this way the epidemic of typhus fever was quickly\r\ntransplanted to the north-eastern part of France. Alsace-Lorraine, the\r\nPalatinate, Champagne, and Burgundy were all attacked in succession. The\r\nepidemic raged from Kreuznach to Strassburg; the dispersion of the\r\nretreating army caused even the smallest villages to suffer, so that the\r\npestilence appeared in Worms, Frankenthal, Spires, Oppenheim,\r\nNeustadt-on-the-Hardt, Dürkheim, Landau, Alzey, Trabach, Zweibrücken,\r\nWeissenburg, Hagenau, Zabern, and in other places. Mörs (near\r\nFrankenthal) was almost completely wiped out.[170] The following places\r\nin France are mentioned as having been attacked by the pestilence:\r\nSaint-Avold, Courcelles-Chaussy, Mars-la-Tour, Sierck, Cattenom,\r\nPont-à-Mousson, Toul, Nancy, Étain, Verdun, Bar, Longwy, and Sedan.\r\nThouvenel describes the epidemic of typhus fever in Pont-à-Mousson,\r\nwhich broke out in December 1813, when transports of sick soldiers\r\narrived there, and spread to all the surrounding towns and villages; it\r\nincreased in severity until the middle of March, and by June had almost\r\ndisappeared. He describes in emotional language the endless succession\r\nof wagons that arrived every day:[171]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Who of us will not remember as long as he lives those harrowing\r\n  scenes, which one cannot describe without shuddering? Who will ever\r\n  forget those hundreds of wagons filled with unhappy wounded men who\r\n  had had no medical care since leaving Leipzig; and packed in with\r\n  them were sick men suffering from dysentery, typhus fever, &c.,\r\n  almost all of them dying of inanition, weakness, and filth, as well\r\n  as of disease. Those unfortunate men piteously begged only for a\r\n  place in a hospital already filled with dying men, only to receive\r\n  in reply a forced refusal. And so they were under the cruel\r\n  necessity of going further to die, with the result that they\r\n  infected all the towns and villages along their route, wherever they\r\n  were granted a generous hospitality.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrassburg, comparatively speaking, suffered but little. As early as\r\nDecember 1, the prefect of Strassburg had issued orders that a special\r\nbuilding should be set aside in every town for the reception of sick\r\nsoldiers that arrived there, and that they should under no circumstances\r\nbe housed in the homes of citizens. In October and November\r\nconvalescents had been quartered in the residences of citizens, who had\r\nsubsequently been infected. In November the number of typhus-fever\r\npatients, which averaged ten or fifteen per month, increased to\r\nthirty-six, and in December to 100. In accordance with the\r\nabove-mentioned decree all newly-arrived soldiers were examined by a\r\nBoard of Health; the sick were sent to the hospital, and the healthy\r\nwere quartered with citizens. ‘Notwithstanding this,’ says\r\nReisseisen,[172] ‘the healthy ones infected a large number of\r\ninhabitants through their old woollen overcoats, which were thoroughly\r\nsaturated with the miasma of the hospitals. The clothes that were sold\r\nprivately were particularly dangerous, so that in the latter part of\r\nDecember strict orders were issued to keep watch for the old clothes and\r\nburn them. In the first part of January, when the rather lax siege\r\nbegan, typhus fever spread irresistibly throughout the city; in that\r\nmonth the pestilence reached its climax with 175 deaths. On January 22\r\nthe prefects ordered general fumigations in all public buildings, and\r\nrecommended that the citizens should also fumigate their homes. The\r\nresult was very successful; in February 112 people died, in March 75,\r\nand in April 27, and then typhus fever disappeared. No foreign troops\r\nmarched through the stronghold, and although all the French prisoners of\r\nwar passed through the city, no more citizens were infected by them, for\r\nthe reason that they were quartered in the fortifications.\r\n\r\nThe devastation caused by the pestilence in Metz was no less than\r\nfrightful. Maréchal and Didion[173] give us a picture of this severe\r\nepidemic. On November 19, 1813, some 5,000 sick soldiers were assigned\r\nto that city; it was necessary to see that they were sheltered, and at\r\nthe same time measures were adopted to prevent the disease from\r\nspreading. According to the report of the astute Mayor of Metz, Baron\r\nMarchant, the 5,000 soldiers, all of them suffering from an infectious\r\ndisease, arrived, and sixty of them died every day. All the physicians\r\nin Metz contracted the disease, and several of them died. It was\r\nimpossible to procure sick-attendants, since those who had performed\r\nthis service had all contracted the disease, conveyed it home, and\r\ninfected their families. Sick soldiers who were quartered privately, and\r\nparticularly convalescents, also helped to spread the disease throughout\r\nthe city; more than 150 houses were infected. In the latter part of\r\nDecember the number of patients greatly increased. On January 1, 1814,\r\nafter Blücher had crossed the Rhine, the Germans marched against Metz,\r\nand then an enormous crowd of people from the surrounding country fled\r\nto that city for protection. This caused typhus fever to spread far and\r\nwide throughout the city. Furthermore, sick and exhausted soldiers were\r\nconstantly being sent to Metz, and it is estimated that some 30,000 of\r\nthem arrived there. The worst month was February, and 7,752 soldiers,\r\nall told, died in six months:\r\n\r\n                             November   463\r\n                             December 1,602\r\n                             January  1,360\r\n                             February 2,365\r\n                             March    1,622\r\n                             April      340\r\n\r\n1,294 civilians also died, the largest number (371) likewise in\r\nFebruary. In the entire Department of Moselle, which at that time had\r\nsome 400,000 inhabitants, no less than 10,329 people succumbed to this\r\nepidemic, and this number does not include the soldiers.\r\n\r\nRegarding the wide dissemination of typhus fever in the Departments east\r\nand south of Paris, which formed the scene of the war in the first part\r\nof the year 1814 (the Departments of Haute-Marne, Côte-d’Or, Aube,\r\nYonne, Marne, Seine-et-Marne), no further information is available.\r\nTroyes, Besançon, Dijon, Avallon, and Auxerre are mentioned as places\r\nthat were attacked by the pestilence.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, cases of typhus fever occurred in February, when the war moved\r\ncloser to that city. The sick and wounded soldiers were consequently\r\nobliged to go to the hospitals in Paris; but since these were neither\r\nlarge nor numerous enough to accommodate so many patients, it became\r\nnecessary to open several provisional hospitals in appropriate\r\nbuildings. At first all the typhus-fever patients were taken to the\r\nHôpital de la Pitié, but it soon became necessary to change this policy,\r\nsince the disease had spread throughout all the wards of that building.\r\nIn the latter part of February the first cases of typhus fever appeared\r\nin the city, in consequence of the return of many soldiers to their own\r\nfamilies. In March more and more people contracted the disease, which\r\ntoward the end of the month was raging furiously, though more in the\r\nhospitals than in the city. In the Hospice de la Salpêtrière, which had\r\nbeen converted into a military hospital and began to be used on February\r\n9, 1814, a small number of persons contracted typhus fever in the latter\r\npart of March, and in the months of April and May the disease spread;\r\nafter that, however, it began to abate. A great many nurses and\r\nattendants were taken sick.[174] In April a large number of people in\r\nthe city were lying sick with typhus fever. In one boarding-school, from\r\nwhich several persons visited the hospitals and brought typhus fever\r\nhome with them, thirty people contracted the disease and four succumbed\r\nto it. In May cases of typhus fever became more rare, and in August no\r\nmore people contracted the disease. The mortality in Paris in the year\r\n1814 was very high; whereas in the years 1812 and 1813 the number of\r\ndeaths had been 20,133 and 18,676 respectively, in the year 1814 no less\r\nthan 27,778 people died, which number includes 2,559 soldiers that died\r\nin the hospitals. In the year 1815 the number of deaths decreased again\r\nto 19,992. How large the number of deaths due to typhus fever was, it is\r\nimpossible to state with certainty, since in the case of only a small\r\nnumber of the persons who actually died of typhus fever was that disease\r\nrecorded as the cause of death. The rubric ‘fièvres putrides et\r\nadynamiques’ increased in the year 1813 from 1,337 deaths to 2,860\r\ndeaths, and the rubric ‘fièvres malignes ou ataxiques’ from 804 to\r\n1,376.[175]\r\n\r\nOwing to the overcrowded condition of the hospitals in Paris, soldiers\r\nwere conveyed upon a number of boats on the Seine to Rouen. Since sick\r\nand wounded men were thus transported together, typhus fever was\r\nconveyed to Rouen, where it carried away large numbers of persons\r\nemployed in the hospitals. In the same way, sick and wounded were\r\ntransported to points on the Loire, causing typhus fever to spread to\r\nTours, where 860 soldiers succumbed to it.[176]\r\n\r\nThe proximity of the scene of the war in January and February 1813\r\ncaused typhus fever to break out in the Swiss Cantons lying close to the\r\nFrench border; for example, in the cantons of Basel-Stadt, Basel-Land,\r\nNeuenburg, Solothurn, and Waadt. The number of deaths in these cantons\r\nwas:[177]\r\n\r\n _Year._ _Basel-Stadt._ _Basel-Land._ _Neuenburg._ _Solothurn._ _Waadt._\r\n  1812              442           867        1,041        1,349    3,705\r\n  1813              425           748        1,014        1,072    3,186\r\n  1814              721         1,679        1,335        1,844    3,475\r\n  1815              479           812        1,220        1,240    3,267\r\n  1816              355           710        1,234                 3,720\r\n\r\nAccording to A. Burckhardt,[178] lazaret-fever broke out in Basel with\r\nextraordinary fury when the Allies passed through that city; it raged\r\nparticularly among the foreign soldiers, but also attacked the\r\nattendants in the hospitals and the civil inhabitants. The number of\r\ndeaths caused by it is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n         6. TYPHUS FEVER IN AUSTRIA IN THE YEARS 1813–14.[179]\r\n\r\nThe country in Austria which was most exposed to the ravages of the\r\nepidemic of typhus fever was Bohemia, along whose borders the war was\r\nfor a long time carried on. As early as February 1813, ‘nerve-fever’,\r\naccompanied by petechiae, was borne by Bavarian and Prussian troops into\r\nthe district of Königgrätz, but thanks to energetic and strict measures\r\nof precaution, it did not become very widespread. The principal outbreak\r\nof the epidemic in Bohemia took place in the autumn of the year 1813.\r\nThe number of typhus-fever patients taken into the Prague hospital in\r\nSeptember 1813 was 39, in October 77, in November 196, and in December\r\n287.[180] The region along the Saxon border suffered the most: e.g. the\r\ndistricts of Leitmeritz, Saaz, Rakonitz, and Elbogen. In the Leitmeritz\r\ndistrict typhus appeared in August, and became more severe in September\r\nand October; the places along the military road leading from Dresden to\r\nPrague were particularly hard hit. The epidemic lasted until April. In\r\nthe near-by Kaurzim district sick and wounded soldiers of all nations\r\narrived, after the battles of Pirna, Dresden, and Kulm, causing a\r\nvirulent epidemic to break out everywhere; in many places all the\r\ninhabitants contracted it. In the latter part of the year, when the\r\npestilence seemed to have abated a little, it broke out anew when the\r\nFrench garrison was being taken from Dresden to its place of detention;\r\nin fourteen days 2,422 persons in sixty places contracted the disease,\r\nwhich disappeared in May. Typhus fever had spread over 103 localities,\r\nall told, in that region, and of 8,066 people who contracted it, 751\r\nsuccumbed. In the Saaz district typhus broke out in the last part of\r\nOctober 1813, and carried away large numbers of people; it raged all\r\nalong the military road in the vicinity of the scene of the war. The\r\nhighest mortality was in the month of December, and in May the\r\npestilence disappeared. In the Rakonitz district entire communities lay\r\nsick in the first part of the year, but in April no new cases of the\r\ndisease occurred. In the Elbogen district typhus fever broke out in\r\nSeptember 1813 in the city of Eger, in consequence of the arrival of\r\nFrench prisoners and fugitives; the epidemic soon spread over the entire\r\ndistrict, and lasted until March 1814.\r\n\r\nThe rest of Bohemia suffered less severely from typhus fever in the\r\nwinter of 1813–14. In the Beraun district, lying to the south-west of\r\nPrague, it began in October 1813, when the homes of the citizens became\r\ncrowded with convalescing soldiers; the epidemic came to an end in March\r\n1814. The number of people who contracted the disease was 3,807, while\r\nthe number who succumbed was 296. The adjacent districts of Pilsen and\r\nKattau were likewise attacked; in the Pilsen district typhus fever broke\r\nout in October 1813, in consequence of the arrival of French prisoners;\r\na number of places were infected by them, so that in November and\r\nDecember it developed into an epidemic, which lasted until April. Of\r\n1,185 people who contracted the disease, 237 died. In the Kattau\r\ndistrict 645 contracted the disease and 132 succumbed.\r\n\r\nIn the eastern part of the country the districts of Tabor and Czaslau\r\nwere severely attacked. ‘In the Tabor district’, we read in the\r\nabove-mentioned report,[181] ‘there appeared in the month of August at\r\nNeuhaus, where a field-hospital had been erected, several biliary-mucous\r\nnerve-fevers, which broke out in numerous places along the road to\r\nPrague, soon spread to the Tabor district, and became epidemic. They\r\nquickly revealed their presence in all places where sick soldiers passed\r\nthe night, or where the natives took part in the transportation of sick\r\nsoldiers.’ The climax of the epidemic was in January, and in the middle\r\nof May it disappeared; of 4,267 people who contracted the disease, 448\r\nsuccumbed. In the Czaslau district, adjacent to the Tabor district on\r\nthe north, the disease was disseminated in November 1813 by transports\r\nof prisoners and troops, by the quartering of convalescents in the homes\r\nof peasants, and by peasants who helped to transport sick soldiers. On\r\nDecember 16, 1813, no less than 4,313 civilians in thirteen places were\r\nsuffering from typhus fever. The highest mortality prevailed in the\r\nvicinity of the hospitals; the epidemic disappeared with the arrival of\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever was also conveyed into various parts of Moravia,[182]\r\npartly by Austrian troops, and partly by French prisoners; in the\r\ndistricts of Brünn, Iglau, Olmütz, and Teschen it broke out in numerous\r\nplaces. In twelve communities in these districts, having a combined\r\npopulation of 28,267, some 2,126 people contracted the disease between\r\nDecember 1813 and the summer of 1814, and 207 persons succumbed. In\r\nMarch the epidemic disappeared almost everywhere. According to the\r\nfigures compiled by J. Hain,[183] the number of deaths in Moravia and\r\nAustrian-Silesia together was:\r\n\r\n                          July (1813)    3,818\r\n                          August         3,893\r\n                          September      3,888\r\n                          October        4,059\r\n                          November       4,457\r\n                          December       5,202\r\n                          January (1814) 8,280\r\n                          February       7,249\r\n                          March          7,756\r\n                          April          5,464\r\n                          May            5,541\r\n                          June           4,147\r\n\r\nIn Lower Austria typhus fever also broke out, particularly in Vienna;\r\nthe number of deaths there was:\r\n\r\n                    _Due to typhus fever._ _All deaths._\r\n               1813          784              12,971\r\n               1814         1,529             15,309\r\n\r\nIn the rest of the country few diseases appeared, despite the fact that\r\ntroops kept marching back and forth.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever was conveyed by marching troops to Styria also; the source\r\nof the pestilence was the seven military hospitals in Graz. We read in\r\nthe report:[184] ‘The pestilence, proceeding principally from the seven\r\nmilitary hospitals lying within the city limits as from a focus, was\r\nspread abroad by convalescents, attendants, physicians, &c. The\r\nmortality in these hospitals was extremely high; the buildings set aside\r\nfor the purpose could scarcely accommodate the number of sick.\r\nEverything was topsy-turvy; the corps of field-doctors on hand was not\r\nnearly large enough to take even the most necessary care of the large\r\nnumber of patients.’ The region around Graz, Marburg, and Bruck was most\r\nseverely attacked by the disease, which also spread to Carinthia and\r\nbroke out in Klagenfurt and vicinity.\r\n\r\n\r\n     7. SURVEY OF THE EPIDEMIC OF TYPHUS FEVER IN THE YEARS 1813–14\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to draw an accurate picture of the loss of human life\r\nwhich typhus fever caused in the years 1813–14. This is due, on the one\r\nhand, to the lack of reliable statistics, and, on the other hand, to the\r\nfact that the several regions suffered to a varying degree, depending\r\nupon the number of troops, prisoners, and refugees that they received.\r\nThe number of persons that succumbed to typhus fever in Germany during\r\nthe years 1813–14 must be estimated at least as high as 200,000 or\r\n300,000. Assuming that 200,000 people succumbed to the disease, the\r\nnumber that contracted it would amount to some 2,000,000. Since Germany\r\nat that time had hardly more than 20,000,000 inhabitants, some ten per\r\ncent of them, on the basis of this assumption, contracted the disease.\r\nThe size of this number is significant, when we consider that the\r\nstronger and older people manifested particular susceptibility to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief causes of the wide dissemination of typhus fever in the\r\nyears 1813–14 was the imperfect development of the lazaret system. If at\r\nfirst a lazaret for infectious diseases was available, the number of\r\npatients it was called upon to accommodate in a few days became so large\r\nthat new buildings always had to be opened for them, and it was\r\nimpossible to keep them isolated. The efforts of the various municipal\r\nadministrations to have the lazarets erected outside the city limits\r\nwere powerless against the brutal obstinacy of the French, and, later,\r\nof the Russian generals. The severity of the penalty which they had to\r\npay for unceremoniously housing infected French troops in strongholds\r\ntogether with healthy men, is evident from the fearful devastation\r\ncaused by typhus fever in Danzig, Torgau, Mayence, &c. The little\r\ncommunities were absolutely helpless against the dominating power of the\r\nsoldiers. One might reproach the municipal administrations of that time\r\nwith failing to adopt measures of prevention against the menacing danger\r\nof pestilence, particularly in places which did not suffer in\r\nconsequence of the marching back and forth of soldiers. But one must\r\ntake into account the excitement which permeated the entire people at\r\nthat time—the hopeful longing to be freed from the national enemy’s long\r\noppression, toward which all thinking and planning was directed, the\r\nemployment of all resources for this purpose, and in particular the fact\r\nthat sheer ignorance rendered appropriate measures impossible. If this\r\nignorance prevailed in the highest places, nothing better was to be\r\nexpected of the administrations of the smaller cities and towns. The\r\npopulation was therefore everywhere defenceless against the intrusion of\r\nthe pestilence, which was given an opportunity to become more and more\r\nwidespread. This, however, had not been the case in Central Europe since\r\nthe Thirty Years’ War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n           FROM THE AGE OF NAPOLEON TO THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n                   1. THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR OF 1828–9\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 1828, Russia declared war against Turkey; the fighting took\r\nplace partly in the Balkan Peninsula, in Wallachia and Bulgaria, and\r\npartly in Transcaucasia. In the western scene of the war, the Russians,\r\nafter the capture of Varna and the futile siege of Schumla in the\r\ncampaign of the year 1828, were obliged to retire to the left bank of\r\nthe Danube; in the second campaign (1829) Diebitsch defeated the Turks\r\nat Kulevtchi, marched across the Balkan Peninsula, and appeared\r\nunexpectedly at Adrianople, which the Turks surrendered to him without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nAn unusually severe epidemic of bubonic plague accompanied this\r\ncampaign. In the year 1828 plague had spread from Asia Minor to European\r\nTurkey and Wallachia; as early as 1825 and 1826 it appeared in\r\nBucharest, while sporadic cases of the disease occurred in Wallachia in\r\nthe summer of 1827 and in the winter of 1827–8.[185] On April 30, 1828,\r\nthe first Russian troops made their appearance in Bucharest; they were\r\nquartered in the city itself and in the surrounding villages. On May 13\r\nseven cases of plague appeared in a private house, but the Bucharest\r\nphysicians did not hold the disease to be plague. Orders to disinfect\r\nthe houses were issued, but intercourse with the surrounding villages\r\nwas not stopped. Some thirty inhabitants succumbed to the pestilence in\r\nMay, and at the end of that month three Russian soldiers were allowed to\r\nenter the city. Since the number of cases in the city was increasing,\r\nthe troops stationed there were quartered in the village of Fundeni,\r\nwhere, however, several more people soon contracted the disease. During\r\nthe month of May, plague broke out in other villages of Wallachia, and\r\nin the course of the summer and autumn it spread throughout the entire\r\ncountry. In regard to the origin of this epidemic of plague, Simon[186]\r\nsays: ‘All Wallachia was infected from the year 1826; but had it not\r\nbeen for the war and the consequent afflictions of all kinds, the\r\ndisease would not have developed in the year 1828 into such a furious\r\nand extensive epidemic. The arrival of the Russians was responsible for\r\nthis widespread outbreak, since they carried the infection contracted\r\nfrom the inhabitants to a thousand different places.’\r\n\r\nThe removal of the troops to Fundeni temporarily checked the\r\ndissemination of plague in Bucharest, but in the middle of August it\r\nbroke out again, presumably in consequence of the arrival of more troops\r\nfrom the scene of the war; some thirty or forty villages were attacked\r\nby this epidemic, which lasted until the middle of November. In January\r\n1829, plague was conveyed by troops to Moldau and Jassy, which they were\r\nto make their winter quarters; but the disease, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat it was wrongly diagnosed and declared to be typhus fever, was soon\r\nchecked by energetic measures of precaution. Regarding the number of\r\nplague patients in the Russian army, which was also attacked by several\r\nother diseases, especially malaria, diarrhoea, dysentery, and fever, no\r\ninformation is available; the Russian army numbered 150,000 men, and,\r\naccording to Seidlitz, 134,882 men were received into the lazarets and\r\n75,226 men into the regimental sick-rooms up to the end of February\r\n1829; thus 210,108 men contracted disease in a period of ten\r\nmonths.[187]\r\n\r\nIn March 1829, plague broke out anew. Surgeon-General Witt, who had his\r\nhead-quarters in Jassy, declared that the disease was not plague, but an\r\nendemic fever, and put an end to all measures of precaution in March.\r\n‘After the patients were no longer quarantined,’ says Czetyrkin,[188]\r\n‘the disease, bringing destruction in its train, in the spring and\r\nsummer began to make headway and spread over Moldavia, Wallachia, and\r\nBulgaria; it also accompanied the Russian army across the Balkan\r\nPeninsula and appeared in Rumelia, where it completely wiped out several\r\nhospitals. Those divisions of the army which were kept constantly on the\r\nmarch and were thus exposed to the fresh air, rain, and dew, suffered\r\nless severely; but the garrisons in the cities and strongholds were more\r\nfuriously attacked by the dreaded enemy. The overcrowded condition of\r\nthe lazarets, the lack of competent nurses and physicians (most of whom\r\nwere exterminated by plague), the uncertainty regarding the nature of\r\nthe disease—all this constituted the reason why the pestilence could not\r\nbe checked.’\r\n\r\nThe disease first appeared in March 1829 throughout Wallachia, but after\r\nthe middle of May it also revealed its presence south of the Danube;\r\nGalatz, Babadag, Kustendji, Mangalia, Bazardschik, and Kavarna were\r\nattacked in succession.\r\n\r\nVarna suffered very severely; according to Petersenn, the first cases\r\noccurred there in May 1829, in the infantry regiment Witepsk. The\r\npatients were housed in tents on the sea-shore outside the city, and\r\nsince the number of people who contracted the disease continued to\r\nincrease, all the patients in the hospitals were soon taken there. The\r\ncity was finally completely evacuated and closed up, after the\r\ninhabitants had been assigned to definite places to live in the open\r\nfields and in a near-by forest. The plague reached its climax in the\r\nlatter part of June. ‘There was not a hospital,’ says Petersenn,[189]\r\n‘not a quarter of the city, not a division of troops, not a family, not\r\na single place, which had escaped infection, and everywhere one came\r\nacross victims of the pestilence, some dying and some dead; for it\r\nspared neither sex nor age nor class.’ And in another place the same\r\nphysician says:[190] ‘If the inside of the plague-camp afforded a\r\nterrible sight, where sick men tossed about, gasping in the burning\r\nsummer heat, between the dead and dying, the conditions outside of the\r\nplague-camp were no more pleasant to witness; for along the roads from\r\nthe city to the hospitals, on fields and meadows, behind every shrub, in\r\nevery ditch, dead and dying men were stretched out everywhere.’ And\r\nSeidlitz, who visited Varna when the plague was at its height, asserts\r\nthat the corpses were piled up ‘like logs’ and carried away ‘by\r\ncartloads’. According to Petersenn,[191] the number of patients that\r\ndied in the plague-hospital at Varna was:\r\n\r\n                       From June 5 to 30   2,238\r\n                       From July 1 to 31   1,484\r\n                       From August 1 to 26   210\r\n\r\nAt the end of August there were only a few plague-patients in Varna. Of\r\nforty-one physicians, twenty-eight contracted the disease and twenty\r\nsuccumbed to it.\r\n\r\nConditions were as bad in many other places as they were in Varna;\r\nSlobodzie, Kustendji, and Mangalia were likewise devastated. In Brailow\r\nthe first cases of plague occurred in March; in April 132 persons\r\nsuccumbed to the disease, in May 150, in June 774, and in July the\r\npestilence abated.[192]\r\n\r\nAfter the Russians crossed the Balkan Peninsula in the summer of 1829,\r\nAdrianople, which was reached on August 12, 1829, was free from plague,\r\nand it remained free until the end of the war. In the first part of\r\nNovember, however, the plague broke out there in the large old barrack\r\nwhich had been converted into a hospital and had become greatly\r\novercrowded. Patients, especially persons suffering from dysentery, had\r\nbeen sent there from all sides, so that their number had increased on\r\nAugust 17 to 1,616, on August 27 to 3,666, and on September 1 to 4,641.\r\nOn November 1, when the head-quarters were removed from there, 6,000\r\nsick and healthy persons were left behind, the great majority of whom\r\nfell victims to the plague. According to Rinck, in the latter part of\r\nNovember ten or twenty soldiers suffering from plague were taken there\r\nevery day, and in the middle of December not one of the 300 sick-rooms\r\nwas spared; from fifty to sixty plague-patients were taken in every day\r\nat this time.[193] In the middle of January 1830 the fury of the disease\r\nabated a little among the Russians, but it raged more and more\r\ndestructively among the civil inhabitants, who numbered some 80,000. In\r\nalmost all the army-divisions stationed south of the Balkans, plague\r\nbroke out in the winter of 1829–30; the entire army, therefore, before\r\nreturning to Russia, had to be quarantined twice for a period of\r\ntwenty-one days.\r\n\r\nPlague also revealed its presence in Transcaucasia, where fighting was\r\nlikewise going on. In Armenia it had broken out shortly before the\r\nbeginning of the Russo-Turkish War, as also in Erzerum. The\r\nreinforcements coming from there had brought plague to Kars, where it\r\nspread rapidly in the Turkish army.[194] In June 1828, when the\r\nstronghold of Kars was stormed, the disease was borne by Turkish\r\nprisoners back to the Russian army; but the strict measures of\r\nField-Marshal Count Paskewitsch prevented it from spreading further in\r\nthe army.[195] But the inhabitants of Kars resisted these orders, and\r\nthe result was that plague continued to rage there, partly in the\r\ngarrison, which in twenty days had 530 plague-patients, and partly among\r\nthe inhabitants, until September. The plague was conveyed by Turkish\r\nprisoners to Eriwan, to the region of Tiflis, and to other places. In\r\nthe stronghold of Achalzich, situated midway between Batum and Tiflis,\r\nplague broke out in the year 1829; in the latter part of February the\r\nstronghold was besieged by the Turks, who were infected with plague. In\r\nconsequence of a sortie of the small garrison on March 6, which resulted\r\nin the withdrawal of the Turks, since at the same time Russian\r\nreinforcements were approaching, the plague was conveyed to Achalzich,\r\nwhere the first cases occurred on March 10 in the garrison, and shortly\r\nafterwards among the inhabitants. On May 23 that part of the garrison\r\nwhich had been spared by the plague was marched out into the open\r\ncountry, and the stronghold was thoroughly cleansed, after which no more\r\ncases were reported. In the fall of 1829 plague completely disappeared\r\nfrom among the Transcaucasian troops, and from the territory under their\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. THE CRIMEAN WAR (1854–6)\r\n\r\nThe Crimean War plays a very conspicuous rôle in the history of\r\nwar-pestilences and of military sanitation; on the one hand, it showed\r\nhow severe a penalty an army has to pay if, without measures of\r\nprecaution, troops are sent to the scene of the war from infected\r\nlocalities; on the other hand, it showed that it is possible to prevent\r\nserious outbreaks of pestilence if energetic measures are adopted to\r\nprovide good food and shelter for the troops. Whereas the English\r\nsoldiers suffered a great deal more from pestilence in the first winter\r\nthan the French soldiers, in the second winter, in consequence of great\r\nimprovements introduced in the housing, clothing, and feeding of troops,\r\nthe English suffered very little, while the French suffered severely.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1853 cholera made its appearance in several places in\r\nFrance, and in the following year it spread over the entire country; it\r\nraged most furiously in the southern districts. Since the French troops,\r\nwho were embarked at Toulon and Marseilles, were consequently infected\r\nwith cholera, those suffering from the disease had to be put ashore from\r\nthe first transport ship at Malta, and others at the Peiraeus. When the\r\ntroops disembarked at Gallipoli there were thirteen cholera-patients\r\namong them, and these were presently followed by other cases. Sporadic\r\ncases of cholera then began to occur wherever the French soldiers went,\r\nas in Nagara, Varna, Adrianople, &c. The fact that the disease was borne\r\nthither by French troops was frankly admitted by most of the French\r\nmilitary physicians; only a few, for example, Cazalas, assumed that the\r\ndisease was already prevalent in Dobrudja.[196]\r\n\r\nDuring the expedition undertaken by the French soldiers to the unhealthy\r\nand deserted district of Dobrudja, cholera broke out in the army like an\r\nexplosion, compelling it to return. The English soldiers during the\r\nsiege of Varna, and also parts of the English fleet, were likewise\r\nattacked by cholera. Statements made by Scrive and Chenu regarding the\r\nnumber of French soldiers that succumbed to the pestilence diverge\r\nwidely; according to Scrive, the French army, which numbered some 55,000\r\nmen, lost 5,183 men between July 3 and August 30, 1854, in consequence\r\nof cholera,[197] while Chenu gives us the following statistics:[198]\r\n\r\n                           _No. patients._ _No. deaths._\r\n               July (1854)           8,239         5,030\r\n               August                3,043         3,015\r\n               September               376           239\r\n\r\nThe English army, which numbered some 30,000 men, also suffered:[199]\r\n\r\n                           _No. patients._ _No. deaths._\r\n               July (1854)             449           285\r\n               August                  938           611\r\n               September             1,232           575\r\n               October                 445           273\r\n\r\nIn September the scene of the war was transferred to the Crimea, but\r\nthere again cholera raged furiously in both armies; in the winter of\r\n1854–5, to be sure, it carried away a relatively small number of men,\r\nbut in the summer of 1855 it broke out anew with great severity. The\r\ntotal number of deaths in the French army during the entire campaign was\r\n12,467, in the English army 4,513, and in the Piedmontese army 1,230.\r\nThe size of the armies varied greatly; the French army was largest in\r\nthe latter part of the year 1855, when it numbered 145,000 men; the\r\ntotal number of English soldiers was 97,864, and that of Piedmontese\r\nsoldiers, 21,000.\r\n\r\nAccording to Häsar,[200] cholera spread far and wide from the scene of\r\nthe war—throughout Turkey, around the Black Sea, in Greece, in Smyrna,\r\nalong the coast of the Dardanelles, in Constantinople, Odessa, Rumelia,\r\nand in the Danube principalities; the inhabitants of the district of\r\nDobrudja also suffered severely from the pestilence, which after the war\r\nspread over a large part of Russia.\r\n\r\nScurvy also raged in the French army in the dry summer of the year 1855,\r\nas well as in the severe winter following. In August 1855 there were\r\n2,581 scurvy patients in the army, which was the largest number in the\r\nsummer months, and in February there were 4,341, the largest number in\r\nthe winter months. The outbreak of scurvy among the English troops, who\r\nalso suffered from the disease in the winter of 1854–5, was later\r\nchecked by the consumption of better food.\r\n\r\nDysentery was also very common: 6,105 French soldiers suffering from\r\nthat disease in the Crimea were taken to the field-lazarets; 2,061 died\r\nthere, and 2,792 were removed to Constantinople. No less than 7,883\r\nEnglish soldiers contracted acute and chronic dysentery, and 2,143\r\nsuccumbed to it.\r\n\r\nAs early as the winter of 1854–5 a small number of cases of typhus fever\r\noccurred among the French and English soldiers; but not until the winter\r\nof 1855–6, between the months of December and March, did the disease\r\nbecome very widespread in the French army in consequence of unfavourable\r\nliving conditions; the English army, on the other hand, scarcely\r\nsuffered at all during that winter. Scrive and Chenu publish the\r\nfollowing statistics relating to the French army in the field-lazarets\r\nof the Crimea:\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Months._      _Size of     _Typhus       _Taken to         _No.\r\n                    army._       fever     Constantinople._   deaths._\r\n                               patients._\r\n December (1855)      145,120          734              204          323\r\n January (1856)       144,512        1,523              320          464\r\n February             132,800        3,402              925        1,435\r\n March                121,000        3,457            1,140        1,830\r\n April                105,000          237                           101\r\n May                   67,000           38                            17\r\n\r\nAccording to Scrive, 11,124 typhus-fever patients, all told, were taken\r\ninto the field-lazarets of the Crimea between September 1854 and July\r\n1856; of these, 3,840 were removed to Constantinople, and 6,018 died in\r\nthe field-lazarets.[201] But Scrive says that this number of\r\ntyphus-fever patients is too small; it must have been increased by the\r\nnumber of persons who contracted the disease in the field-lazarets and\r\nhospitals, 4,502 of whom succumbed to it, and the number who contracted\r\nand succumbed to it in Constantinople and France, making 7,000 all told.\r\nAccording to Scrive, therefore, the total number of deaths due to typhus\r\nfever in the French army was no less than 17,515, from which he assumes\r\nthat at least 35,000 men contracted the disease.[202]\r\n\r\nIn the English army typhus fever appeared only sporadically in the\r\nwinter of 1855–6; according to Chenu, 167 men contracted the disease and\r\n62 succumbed to it.[203]\r\n\r\nAmong the Russian troops typhus fever raged furiously,[204] and\r\naccording to A. Hirsch it was also very widespread in southern\r\nRussia.[205]\r\n\r\nIn Constantinople, typhus fever, although it infected numerous persons\r\nin the military hospitals, apparently did not spread to the civil\r\npopulation. Baudens, who after the capture of Sebastopol came to the\r\nOrient, says expressly that the inhabitants of Constantinople were\r\nspared by the epidemic during its entire course.[206]\r\n\r\nAccording to Murchison, typhus fever was borne by English troops to\r\nEnglish soil, where in the years 1856–7 it caused epidemics in various\r\nparts of the country. The following table indicates the number of\r\ntyphus-fever patients taken into the Fever Hospital in London:\r\n\r\n                               1854   337\r\n                               1855   342\r\n                               1856 1,062\r\n                               1857   274\r\n                               1858    15\r\n\r\nThe increased number in London was not due to the fact that the disease\r\nwas brought over from Ireland, since there were only fifty-three\r\nIrishmen among the patients, and only two of them had been in the city\r\nless than three months. On the other hand, the warlike events caused a\r\nfamine, resulting in much misery among the poor, and this favoured the\r\nfurther dissemination of the disease.[207]\r\n\r\nWhen the French troops were transported back to France, energetic and\r\nextensive measures of precaution were adopted; only those troops were\r\nallowed to embark who had for several weeks been entirely recovered from\r\ntyphus fever; several stations for the discharge of men who contracted\r\nthe disease on the way were located along the coast of the Mediterranean\r\nSea, and sixty-two patients, all told, were left behind at them;\r\nsuspected divisions of troops, before disembarking at Marseilles, were\r\nquarantined for a time on several islands along the coast, on St.\r\nMarguerite (Îles de Lérins), on the Îles d’Hyères, and on others, and\r\nbefore entering the city they were examined again, bathed, and\r\nreclothed. The result was successful. Laveran says:[208] ‘The further\r\none went away from the seat of the infection, and the more the soldiers\r\nscattered, the more the miasm seemed to lose strength; in France the\r\ntyphus-fever patients gave rise to only a few cases inside the hospitals\r\nwhere they were being cared for; the disease was never communicated to\r\nthe civil population.’\r\n\r\nSporadic cases were observed in Marseilles, Toulon, Avignon,\r\nChalon-sur-Saône, and in other places. A small lazaret-epidemic also\r\noccurred in Paris in the Val-de-Grâce; according to Godelier,[209]\r\nalmost all the patients there belonged to the Fiftieth Regiment, which\r\non November 30, 1855, embarked at Kamiesch. The condition of health in\r\nthe regiment at that time was good, and, in particular, it was free of\r\ntyphus fever. Of the two ships on which the soldiers were transported,\r\nthe one took only thirty days to get from Kamiesch to Marseilles and had\r\nno cases of typhus fever, while the other, which had a harder voyage,\r\ntook fifty days and had numerous cases of typhus fever on the way;\r\nfifteen patients were put into the hospital at Malta and twenty-five in\r\nthat at Marseilles. No less than fifty-eight soldiers in this regiment\r\ncontracted the disease in the Val-de-Grâce, and they infected five\r\nnurses; eight soldiers and one nurse fell victims to the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n                3. THE NORTH AMERICAN CIVIL WAR (1861–5)\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the Civil War almost nothing was done in the two\r\narmies to prevent the outbreak and dissemination of diseases; the\r\nassembling of so many troops rendered severe pestilences inevitable. The\r\nsuccessful activity of numerous voluntary societies did a great deal of\r\ngood in the way of improved methods of sanitation; the centre from which\r\nthis activity emanated was an officially recognized Sanitary Commission,\r\nfounded on June 15, 1861, which made the prevention of pestilences its\r\nprincipal function. It was enabled to carry on its work by large\r\nvoluntary contributions of money. The means which the Commission\r\nemployed were: good equipment, food, and shelter for the men, isolation\r\nof men suffering from infectious diseases, burning of the clothes, beds,\r\nand tents used by these patients, erection of clean, well-ventilated\r\nbarrack-lazarets, and comprehensive plans for transferring invalid\r\nsoldiers from the field-hospitals.[210]\r\n\r\nSince upwards of a million men, counting both sides, were gradually\r\nbrought face to face with one another, the loss of human life was\r\nnecessarily terrible. Regarding the losses sustained by the Northern\r\nStates, we are excellently informed by an exhaustive health-report in\r\nsix volumes, issued by the United States.[211] The report also contains\r\nsome statistics regarding the prevalence of disease among the\r\nConfederates and regarding the prisoners, but no figures relating to the\r\nlosses sustained by the Southern States are available.\r\n\r\nRegarding the total loss of troops sustained by the Northern States, we\r\nfind the following compilation:[212]\r\n\r\n     _Cause of death._      _White troops._ _Coloured troops._ _Total._\r\n Killed in battle                    42,724              1,514   44,238\r\n Died from wounds, &c.               47,445              1,760   49,205\r\n Suicide, murder, execution             469                 57      526\r\n Diseases                           157,004             29,212  186,216\r\n Unknown causes                      23,347                837   24,184\r\n                                    ———————             ——————  ———————\r\n           Total                    270,989             33,380  304,369\r\n\r\nIf we divide the deaths of unknown cause proportionally among the other\r\ngroups, the total number of deaths among the white troops due to\r\ndiseases was 171,806, and among the coloured troops 29,963.\r\n\r\nIn the statistical table in the first volume of the _Medical History_\r\nthe figures relating to the number of deaths are not complete; the total\r\nnumbers given there are:\r\n\r\n                                _White troops._ _Coloured troops._\r\n     Wounds, &c.                         36,688              1,427\r\n     Suicide, murder, execution             549                 78\r\n     Diseases                           128,937             27,499\r\n     Uncertain                              449                  ?\r\n                                        ———————             ——————\r\n               Total                    166,623             29,004\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever demanded the largest number of victims; in the first two\r\nyears of the war it appeared in the form of murderous epidemics in the\r\nNorthern army, mostly in the Atlantic and central districts, and less\r\nseverely in the region of the great ocean. If the common continued\r\nfevers, the typho-malarial fevers, and typhus fever, are combined with\r\nthe typhoid fevers and looked upon as typhoid fever, there died from\r\nthis cause in the Northern army during the entire war 32,112 white\r\ntroops and 3,689 coloured troops. In considering these figures, we must\r\nremember that, as stated above, they are incomplete. On this basis, out\r\nof every 1,000 men there succumbed to typhoid fever:[213]\r\n\r\n                       _White troops._ _Coloured troops._\r\n               1861–2            20·75\r\n               1862–3            18·24\r\n               1863–4             8·52              28·50\r\n               1864–5            11·45              19·31\r\n               1865–6             8·98              11·60\r\n                                 —————              —————\r\n               Average           13·58               19·8\r\n\r\nAs in the case of typhoid fever, so also in the case of other diseases,\r\nthe coloured troops suffered the heaviest losses, probably because the\r\nfood and shelter they received were not so good, and perhaps also\r\nbecause they had less understanding of the sanitary measures that were\r\nordered. Among the Confederate prisoners that were brought north, about\r\n40,875 in number, 18·4 out of every 1,000 succumbed to typhoid\r\nfever.[214]\r\n\r\nRegarding the appearance of typhus fever in the American Civil War,\r\nviews diverge. Since only a relatively small number of cases of that\r\ndisease are recorded, it is probable that those cases were wrongly\r\ndiagnosed, since typhus fever is so highly contagious. In the\r\nhealth-reports of the Northern States, in which the word typhus, as in\r\nEngland and France, means typhus fever, we find the following figures\r\nrelating to the disease:\r\n\r\n                 _No. that contracted it._ _No. that succumbed to it._\r\n White troops                        2,501                         850\r\n Coloured troops                       123                         108\r\n\r\nBut there are very few case-histories and absolutely no post-mortem\r\nreports available from which one can draw a positive conclusion. Laveran\r\ndoubts the occurrence of typhus fever.[215] According to Niedner, on the\r\nother hand, typhus fever prevailed among the Northern prisoners in the\r\nterribly neglected prisons of Salisbury, North Carolina, and probably,\r\ntoo, in other places.[216] It is to be surmised that the increased\r\nnumber of typhus fever patients in New York and Philadelphia, &c., which\r\nHirsch adduces in accordance with the statements of da Costa and Corse,\r\nwas connected with the epidemic among the prisoners.[217] According to\r\nCorse, the number of deaths due to typhus fever in Philadelphia was 37\r\nin the year 1862, 131 in 1863, and 335 in 1864.\r\n\r\nUnusually prevalent were diarrhoea and dysentery, so that,\r\nnotwithstanding their relatively mild character, they caused a large\r\nnumber of deaths. The cases of cholera reported were not Asiatic\r\ncholera, but a local form of the disease. In the Northern army the\r\nfollowing figures indicate the number of deaths due to acute and chronic\r\ndysentery and diarrhoea:\r\n\r\n                    WHITE TROOPS.

The dissemination of the disease was helped along by the fact\r\nthat vaccination, which had been neglected on account of the hasty\r\nmobilization, could not be attended to as rapidly as was desirable.\r\n\r\nMeasles also broke out in both armies in the form of widespread\r\nepidemics. All told, 67,763 white troops and 8,555 coloured troops\r\ncontracted the disease, while 4,246 of the former and 931 of the latter\r\nsuccumbed to it. Out of every 1,000 men there succumbed:[219]\r\n\r\n                   SMALL-POX.

It is absurd to say, then, that the\r\nnegroes are immune to the disease; on the contrary, they contracted it\r\nmuch more frequently and suffered a great deal more severely from it\r\nthan the whites. The troops in the military districts of Carolina and\r\nArkansas, and also along the great rivers—the Mississippi, Ohio, and\r\nPotomac—were attacked by it with particular severity.

Regarding the\r\nconditions among the Confederate prisoners that were interned in the\r\nNorthern States we are informed by the following table. The average\r\nnumber of men in the prisons was 40,815, and of this number 19,060, all\r\ntold, died; taking the entire war into account, this gives a mortality\r\nof 230.7 per 1,000 per annum.[222] The figures are divided among the\r\nvarious diseases as follows:\r\n\r\n                                       _Deaths (all    _Annual rate per\r\n                                          told)._           1,000._\r\n Typhoid Fever, Typhus Fever                     1,109              13·6\r\n Malaria                                         1,026              12·6\r\n Small-pox, Measles, Scarlet Fever,              3,453              42·3\r\n   Erysipelas\r\n Diarrhoea, Dysentery                            5,965              73·0\r\n Scurvy                                            351               4·3\r\n Bronchitis                                        133               1·6\r\n Inflammation of the Lungs and                   5,042              61·7\r\n   Pleurisy\r\n Other diseases                                  1,729              21·3\r\n Wounds and uncertain maladies                     252               0·3\r\n                                                ——————             —————\r\n                Total                           19,060             230·7\r\n\r\nThe conditions among the Northern prisoners confined in the Southern\r\nprisons were still worse. In the Andersonville prison, where in the six\r\nmonths between March 1 and August 31, 1864, an average of 19,453\r\nprisoners were confined, 7,712 died; this means an annual rate of 792.8\r\nper 1,000 men.

But certain it is that\r\nthis happened to a great extent in the regions where the fighting took\r\nplace. In the case of two States, Massachusetts and Connecticut,\r\nmortality statistics are available; in both we find an increased\r\ndeath-rate during the Civil War. The figures, which do not include the\r\nstill-births, are as follows:\r\n\r\n                _Year._ _Connecticut._ _Massachusetts._\r\n                 1860        16·3            18·7\r\n                 1861        16·5            19·5\r\n                 1862        18·0            18·5\r\n                 1863        18·0            22·1\r\n                 1864        19·0            22·8\r\n                 1865        16·0            20·6\r\n                 1866        15·0            18·1\r\n                 1867        14·3            17·0\r\n\r\nIn the case of Massachusetts, moreover, we have statistics relating to\r\nthe cause of death; these statistics show a considerable increase in\r\ndeaths due to typhoid fever, small-pox, and dysentery; the mortality of\r\nscarlet fever was also very high there during the war-years, but this\r\nfact was in no way connected with the war. The number of people who\r\ncontracted the above-mentioned diseases in Massachusetts was:[224]\r\n\r\n           _Year._ _Typhoid Fever._ _Small-pox._ _Dysentery._\r\n            1860                937          334          441\r\n            1861                989           33          532\r\n            1862              1,135           40          479\r\n            1863              1,442           42        1,156\r\n            1864              1,344          242        1,186\r\n            1865              1,694          221        1,548\r\n            1866              1,091          141          949\r\n            1867                965          196          658\r\n\r\n\r\n                    4. THE ITALIAN WAR OF 1859[225]\r\n\r\nThe Italian War of 1859, which the French and Piedmontese together waged\r\nagainst Austria in Upper Italy, was not attended by any severe\r\npestilences, probably because it was terminated in a comparatively short\r\ntime, and the number of troops engaged was not very large. To be sure,\r\ntyphoid fever and dysentery carried away many men on both sides, while\r\nan unusually large number of soldiers contracted malaria. Those fevers\r\nwhich were called ‘Fièvres rémittentes épidémiques d’Italie’, and which,\r\nnotwithstanding their frequent occurrence, caused only a few deaths,\r\naccording to Niedner were for the most part malaria, and not relapsing\r\nfever. The Austrian army seems to have lost more men in consequence of\r\npestilences than the French army. Regarding the spreading of the\r\npestilences on a large scale from the armies to the civil population we\r\nhave no information.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       5. THE DANISH WAR OF 1864\r\n\r\nIn the war of 1864, which Austria and Prussia waged against Denmark, no\r\nepidemics of wide extent occurred. ‘The small number of men engaged,’\r\nsays Knaak,[226] ‘the not particularly unfavourable external conditions,\r\nthe constant communication between the fighting armies and their\r\nhome-countries, and the non-appearance of large epidemics, all helped to\r\nrender the health-conditions of the war favourable.’ The total loss\r\nsustained by the Prussian army, which reached a maximum size of 63,500\r\nmen, amounted to 1,048 men; of these 738 died in battle, in consequence\r\nof wounds, &c., 310 succumbed to diseases, 193 of the latter to typhoid\r\nfever. Statements regarding the number of deaths in the Austrian army,\r\nwhich amounted to 25,000 men, are not available. The Danish army, which\r\nnumbered 54,000 men, lost 1,446 in consequence of wounds, &c., and 820\r\nin consequence of diseases.[227]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       6. THE GERMAN WAR OF 1866\r\n\r\nAs regards sanitation the German War of 1866 acquired importance through\r\nthe appearance of cholera on the scene of the fighting. None of the\r\nother infectious diseases developed very extensively during this war; of\r\nthe Prussian army, which numbered some 280,000 men, only 379, all told,\r\nsuccumbed to typhoid fever, and dysentery did not appear at all. A\r\nrather mild epidemic of small-pox spread throughout a considerable part\r\nof Germany in the year 1865, and lasted until the year 1866; whether or\r\nnot the war helped the disease to spread, which is not unlikely, we\r\ncannot state with certainty owing to a lack of bases of comparison. The\r\nGerman troops were well vaccinated, and the number who contracted the\r\ndisease was no larger during the war than in times of peace. It is\r\nundoubtedly true, however, that the war exerted an unwholesome influence\r\nupon the dissemination of cholera throughout Germany and Austria.[228]\r\nCholera had revealed its presence in Germany for the first time in the\r\nyear 1865; it broke out in Altenburg, during its fourth passage through\r\nEurope, having been borne thither from Odessa. In the course of the year\r\nit broke out, in a comparatively mild form, in many places in Saxony. In\r\nthe year 1866 it raged very extensively and furiously in the Rhine\r\nprovince and in Westphalia, whither it was borne from Luxemburg; in May\r\ncases of the disease occurred in several seaport towns of Pomerania\r\n(Swinemünde, Stettin, Cammin, &c.), and in June it broke out in Hamburg,\r\nBerlin, Posen, Silesia, East and West Prussia, and in the kingdom of\r\nSaxony.[229] Thus it came about that some of the troops enlisted came\r\nfrom infected parts of Silesia and Saxony, and the result was that\r\nindividual cases of cholera began to occur in the Prussian army.\r\n\r\nThe disease was conveyed by soldiers from Stettin to Leipzig, where it\r\nspread to the civil population; from Leipzig it spread throughout Saxony\r\nand Thuringia. When the Prussian army advanced into Bohemia the cases of\r\nthe disease began to increase, and after the battle of Königgrätz (July\r\n3, 1866) the dissemination of the disease was helped along by the\r\ncrowding together of large numbers of sick and wounded soldiers. The\r\nrapid advance of the Prussian army increased the disease’s rate of\r\ndissemination; on all the army’s lines of march large numbers of sick\r\nsoldiers were left behind, for example, in Göritz, Gitschin, Königinhof,\r\nPardubitz, Czaslau, and Leitomischl. In Prague cases of cholera were\r\nreported a few days after the city was occupied. The pestilence was\r\nconveyed by Prussian soldiers to Moravia, where it appeared in Prerau,\r\nBrünn, Iglau, Klosterbrück, Znaym, and Nikolsburg. The further advance\r\nof the Prussians conveyed it to Lower Austria; in Vienna it did not\r\nbreak out until August.\r\n\r\nSome think that the pestilence was conveyed into Austria from Bukowina,\r\nwhere it had broken out in May 1866. When the war broke out, it is\r\nmaintained, the disease was conveyed by troops to the western\r\ncrown-lands of Austria.[230] ‘The truth’, says Niedner, ‘probably lies\r\nhalf way between; the epidemic in Bohemia was disseminated chiefly by\r\nthe Prussian troops, but in the other Austrian countries by Austrian\r\ntroops.’ Daimer,[231] one of the best authorities on the history of\r\npestilences in Austria, says: ‘In the year 1866 an epidemic of cholera\r\ncame to an end in Bukowina, where it was looked upon as the continuation\r\nof one that had been prevailing in Turkey and Roumania; it spread\r\nthroughout the countries in which fighting was going on at that time,\r\nand was borne by troops to remote regions.’ According to Presl,[232] the\r\nnumber of deaths due to cholera in the several crown-lands in the year\r\n1866 was:\r\n\r\n                           _No. inhabitants          _Deaths due to\r\n                          (Dec. 31, 1869)._             cholera._\r\n Lower Austria                         1,983,149                  15,114\r\n Upper Austria                           733,241                     153\r\n Salzburg                                152,141                       1\r\n Styria                                1,139,205                     260\r\n Carinthia                               336,768                      40\r\n Carniola                                465,463                     930\r\n Küstenland                              585,467                   1,067\r\n Tirol and Vorarlberg                    880,985                      25\r\n Bohemia                               5,151,332                  42,730\r\n Moravia                               2,016,186                  55,527\r\n Silesia                                 518,443                   2,919\r\n Galicia                               5,491,675                  34,857\r\n Bukowina                                522,481                  11,656\r\n Dalmatia                                445,201                      13\r\n                                      ——————————                 ———————\r\n     All Austria                      20,421,737                 165,292\r\n\r\nIn Prussia, too, cholera spread, in consequence of the war, more widely\r\nthan ever before; the total number of deaths caused by it in the year\r\n1866 was no less than 114,776, and in the following year it was\r\n6,086.[233] Of the Prussian troops 4,529 (16·2 per cent) succumbed to\r\ncholera, and the total loss due to disease was 5,219; only 4,008 men\r\nwere killed on the field or died from wounds.\r\n\r\nIn the Grand Duchy of Hesse a few rather small epidemics occurred, and a\r\nlarger one in Mayence.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Baden the connexion between the appearance of cholera and\r\nthe war has been carefully investigated.[234] The disease broke out in\r\nthe region of the Main and Tauber and in the Odenwald, and in regions\r\nwhich had never before been attacked by cholera. On July 24, 1866,\r\nWertheim received a Prussian garrison, which on the 26th was joined by\r\nparts of the Hamburg contingent. As mentioned above, cholera had already\r\nbroken out in Hamburg in June, and a few days after the arrival of the\r\nHanseatic troops some of them contracted the disease and were taken,\r\ndespite the objections of the local authorities, to the town hospital.\r\nOn August 6, cases of the disease appeared in the city, and they\r\nconstituted the beginning of a small epidemic which lasted six weeks. On\r\nSeptember 22 the epidemic was over, after the population of 3,383 had\r\nlost 28 persons by death; 64 persons contracted the disease. In near-by\r\nFreudenberg, of 42 people that contracted the disease, 23 died. In\r\nSchönfeld two soldiers of the Hamburg contingent contracted the disease\r\non July 29; the first case among the civil inhabitants, who numbered\r\n524, was on August 2, and in a few days a small epidemic began; 166\r\npeople contracted the disease and 55 succumbed to it. At the same time\r\nthe Hanseatic troops conveyed the disease to Gerlachsheim, where 61\r\npersons contracted it and 32 died of it, and also to Ilmspan, where 97\r\ncontracted it and 34 succumbed to it. On August 1 the Hamburg soldiers\r\ncame to Grünsfeld and brought four cholera patients with them, and the\r\nresult was that 177 of the inhabitants, who numbered 1,458 all told,\r\ncontracted the disease and 23 of them died. The disease was conveyed to\r\nDittigheim by cholera convalescents of the Hamburg contingent, and 225\r\npersons contracted it there and 66 succumbed to it. In Gerlachsheim it\r\nappeared after a Saxon ammunition-column, which was supposed to be\r\nabsolutely free from the disease, had passed through the city. In the\r\ncase of Walldurn, which had a very severe epidemic (the city had 3,339\r\ninhabitants, and of these 827 contracted the disease and 113 succumbed\r\nto it), it was impossible to prove that the disease broke out in\r\nconsequence of the arrival of the soldiers. Külsheim, which was infected\r\nfrom Walldurn, had only a small number of cases. Throughout Baden 1,774\r\npersons contracted cholera and 404 succumbed to it. From these\r\nstatements it is very evident that the danger of an extensive epidemic\r\nof cholera in the regions south of the Main would have been very great,\r\nif the war had been carried on there on a large scale, and had thus\r\nprevented the authorities from taking measures to prevent the\r\ndissemination of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe small epidemic in Uzmemmingen, a village of 700 inhabitants in the\r\nnorth-east part of Württemberg, was brought about by a chamber-maid, who\r\non August 25 brought the disease from a Bohemian place through which a\r\nPrussian detachment had passed; 60 persons, all told, contracted the\r\ndisease in Uzmemmingen, and 19 succumbed to it.[235]\r\n\r\nIn the Bavarian Governmental District of Lower Franconia cholera broke\r\nout, as in Baden, in consequence of the operations of Prussian\r\ntroops.[236] In the last week of July there were skirmishes between the\r\nPrussians and Bavarians near Hettstadt and Waldbrunn; after the\r\nwithdrawal of the Prussians, many of whom were seized with diarrhoea,\r\ncholera broke out in both of those villages. The outbreak in Miltenberg\r\nwas also connected with the arrival there of Prussian soldiers.\r\nPresently other places in Lower Franconia were attacked; for example,\r\nRothenfels, Birkenfeld, Karbach, Stadtprozelten, Tiefenthal,\r\nWaldbüttelbrunn, &c. A Bavarian authority gives credit for the\r\nnon-appearance of the disease in Remlingen and among the civil\r\ninhabitants of Uettingen, where Prussian soldiers suffering from cholera\r\nlay, to the care and vigilance of the Prussian military physicians.\r\nCholera also appeared in the Governmental District of Swabia, breaking\r\nout in the cities along the Danube, in Höchstädt, Dillingen,\r\nGundelfingen, and Neuburg. But it was impossible to prove that the\r\ndisease was conveyed thither from the scene of the war.[237]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR OF 1870–1, AND THE EPIDEMIC OF SMALL-POX IN THE\r\n                      EUROPEAN STATES CAUSED BY IT\r\n\r\n\r\n                         I. SIZE OF THE ARMIES\r\n\r\nIn the Franco-German War of 1870–1, a larger number of troops were\r\nassembled within a short time upon the field of battle than in any\r\nprevious campaign. On the German side 33,101 officers and 1,113,254 men\r\ntook part in the war; the average number of men in the German field-army\r\nwas 815,000. The total number of French soldiers under arms is not\r\ndefinitely known; that it was enormous is evident from the fact that the\r\nnumber of prisoners taken (including the garrison in Paris and General\r\nBourbaki’s army) amounted to no less than 21,500 officers and 702,000\r\nmen. At certain periods of the war huge bodies of troops were\r\ncongregated within comparatively narrow limits; at the battle of\r\nGravelotte (August 18, 1870) some 180,000 to 200,000 men faced one\r\nanother on either side; at the siege of Metz the average size of the\r\nGerman investing army was 240,000 men, while the French army in the city\r\nnumbered 173,000 men at the time of the capitulation. At the battle of\r\nSedan (September 1, 1870) 124,000 French soldiers were opposed to nearly\r\ntwice that number of Germans. The garrison in Paris amounted to about\r\n250,000 men, while the German besiegers averaged 240,000 men.\r\n\r\n\r\n             II. DYSENTERY, TYPHOID FEVER, AND TYPHUS FEVER\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that these enormous congregations of men were often\r\nexposed to very unfavourable weather conditions, and were much of the\r\ntime scantily fed, the number of German field-troops that contracted and\r\nsuccumbed to infectious diseases was comparatively small. The total loss\r\nsustained by the German army in consequence of injuries and diseases\r\namounted to 43,182 men and of these 14,648 died of disease. The\r\nfollowing table indicates the percentage of deaths caused by the various\r\ndiseases:\r\n\r\n                        _Disease._         _Per cent._\r\n                 Typhoid Fever                    60·0\r\n                 Dysentery                        16·2\r\n                 Small-pox                         1·9\r\n                 Intermittent Fever                0·1\r\n                 Other infectious diseases         0·3\r\n                 Other diseases                   21·5\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever and dysentery were most prevalent, for the reason that the\r\ntroops were often quartered in places where these diseases were already\r\nendemic. Regarding these matters we are accurately informed by the\r\n‘Health Report relating to the German Armies in the War of 1870–1\r\nagainst France’, an exhaustive account published by the Medical Division\r\nof the Prussian War Department.[238]\r\n\r\nA total of 74,205 men in the German field-army contracted typhoid and\r\ngastric fever, and 8,904 succumbed to them. The eastern Departments of\r\nFrance, especially the city and vicinity of Metz, were constantly\r\nafflicted with typhoid fever. This explains why both the German\r\nbesiegers and the French defenders suffered so severely from that\r\ndisease, the dissemination of which was helped by the contamination of\r\nthe springs and water-courses, partly through excessive use, and partly\r\nin consequence of the burial of dead men and horses in close proximity\r\nto them. And while drinking-water was for that reason brought from a\r\ndistance, the water used for other purposes was obtained in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood. It is obvious that typhoid fever must have\r\nraged extensively among the inhabitants of the villages surrounding\r\nMetz, the mortality in which during the siege was three times as high as\r\nnormal. This is evident from a compilation of figures in the German\r\nHealth Report,[239] indicating how the death-rate in these villages\r\nrapidly decreased after the withdrawal of the Germans; per 100\r\ninhabitants, there died in:\r\n\r\n                     _Inhabitants._ _Nov._ _Dec._ _Jan._ _Feb._ _March._\r\n Verneville                     672   2·39   1·34   1·04   0·30     0·74\r\n St. Privat                     480   2·70   1·20   1·68   0·84     0·42\r\n Gravelotte                     708   2·14   0·71   0·55   0·71        —\r\n Ste.

As at Metz, so also at Sedan and Paris, the troops suffered\r\nseverely from typhoid fever.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of typhoid-fever patients were taken to lazarets in\r\nGermany; the Prussian lazarets alone took in 30,507, of whom 1,376 died.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever raged furiously among the French prisoners of war, who\r\nusually brought the germ of the disease with them from the scene of the\r\nhostilities. ‘Most observers’, we read in the German Health Report,[240]\r\n‘agree that the disease was most prevalent during the first three weeks\r\nafter the arrival of large transports of prisoners at their place of\r\ndetention; after that it gradually abated, and finally appeared only\r\nsporadically.’ The military prisons, however, while they often formed\r\nnew sources of infection, did not help to disseminate the disease, owing\r\nto the advanced season of the year.\r\n\r\nIt made considerable difference from what part of the scene of the war\r\nthe prisoners came; those coming from Strassburg and Toul were much less\r\nseverely infected with typhoid fever than those from Sedan and Metz.\r\nThis applies particularly to General Bourbaki’s men, who manifested the\r\nleast power of resistance to the disease. In Rastatt, for example, there\r\nwere at one time sixty prisoners suffering from typhoid fever; of those\r\nwho had come from Strassburg, Neubreisach, and Schlettstadt 13·3 per\r\ncent died; of those from Metz 14·5 per cent died, and of those from\r\nBourbaki’s army 40·6 per cent died. Of the French prisoners confined in\r\nGermany (the maximum number was 374,995 and the average number 262,496)\r\n15,020 contracted typhoid fever and 3,835 succumbed to it. The\r\nprevalence of the disease among the German troops, as compared with its\r\nprevalence among the French prisoners, is indicated by the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n                            _No. per 1,000 that   _No. that died per 100\r\n                            succumbed to typhoid        treated._\r\n                                  fever._\r\n Mobile German army                          11·2                   12·0\r\n Immobile German army[241]                    3·0                    4·1\r\n French prisoners                            14·6                   25·6\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of the places in which all these French prisoners\r\nsuffering from typhoid fever were confined was necessarily unsafe to\r\nlive in; and while the epidemics that were brought about by people\r\ncontracting the disease there and conveying it abroad were always kept\r\nlocalized, they were by no means confined to the very narrow limits\r\nindicated, on the basis of scattered communications, in the German\r\nHealth Report. The reason for this moderate dissemination is clear; at\r\nthat time typhoid fever was rendered much less prevalent throughout\r\nGermany by the introduction of extensive sanitary measures (sewers,\r\naqueducts, refuse removal, &c.), which prevented the disease from\r\nconstantly spreading from place to place. In Frankfurt-on-the-Main the\r\nmortality due to typhoid fever was not increased; the number of deaths\r\nper 10,000 inhabitants was:\r\n\r\n                                1867 4·3\r\n                                1868 7·1\r\n                                1869 4·2\r\n                                1870 5·8\r\n                                1871 5·8\r\n                                1872 6·1\r\n\r\nIn many cities, on the other hand, an increased number of deaths due to\r\ntyphoid fever was observed; whether this was attributable to a\r\ntransplantation of it from France, or to a spontaneous outbreak of it\r\namong the many people in these cities who already had the germ in their\r\nsystems, it is impossible to ascertain. From the statistics we are\r\nscarcely ever able to make out the proportion of soldiers and civilians\r\nthat died. The number of deaths due to typhoid fever per 10,000\r\ninhabitants was:\r\n\r\n      _Berlin._ _Munich._ _Elberfeld._ _Strassburg._ _Erfurt._ _Plauen._\r\n                  [242]\r\n 1867       6·9       6·0          8·1           8·5      10·6       2·4\r\n 1868      10·0       8·0          5·3           9·0       9·4       3·3\r\n 1869       6·7      13·0          5·3           9·6                 6·7\r\n 1870       7·8      14·0          9·3          17·8                21·8\r\n 1871       8·9      14·0          9·4          14·2      33·1       2·5\r\n 1872      13·9      24·0          8·8           7·8       5·3       4·9\r\n\r\nIn the case of Strassburg the increase caused by the war is clear; of\r\nthe civil inhabitants alone, 74 died in the year 1869, 137 in the year\r\n1870, and 110 in the year 1871. In the case of Elberfeld the increase\r\nbegan in the year 1870. In Munich the increase began as early as the\r\nyear 1869, although the very high mortality did not commence until 1872,\r\nas in Berlin; in these two cases the increase cannot be said to have\r\nbeen caused by the war. The same is true of Plauen, where the increase\r\nalso began in 1869. In the case of Erfurt, unfortunately no statistics\r\nare available for the year 1870; in the year 1871 the increase there is\r\nvery marked. To be sure, it is not expressly stated that prisoners of\r\nwar are excluded, but as they were not included in the total mortality,\r\nor in that due to small-pox, we may safely assume that they were\r\nexcluded in the case of typhoid fever.[243]\r\n\r\nA marked increase in the prevalence of typhoid fever is to be noted in\r\nthe stronghold of Ulm on the occasion of the arrival there of numerous\r\nprisoners from France; the following table indicates the number of\r\npeople who succumbed to the disease in that city:[244]\r\n\r\n                _Garrison._ _Prisoners._ _Civil population._\r\n           1867          10                               25\r\n           1868           3                                8\r\n           1869           4                                7\r\n           1870          10          150                  15\r\n           1871          15           25                  28\r\n           1872           6                               20\r\n           1873           2                                5\r\n\r\nSince in the case of typhoid fever it is very often impossible to trace\r\nthe source of infection, it is not surprising that in many instances it\r\nis difficult to prove that the disease broke out in any specific\r\nlocality in consequence of the arrival there of a person, or group of\r\npersons, from an infected locality. This applies, for instance, to the\r\nepidemic of typhoid fever that occurred in Meiningen in the year 1871.\r\nIn many places the disease, being prevalent among the prisoners detained\r\nthere, undoubtedly spread to the civil population, but nowhere did this\r\noccur to such an extent as to attract the attention of the authorities.\r\n\r\nAmong the diseases that broke out in the field-armies during the war of\r\n1870–1, dysentery (epidemic dysentery) played an important rôle,\r\nespecially in the months of October and November. Prior to the year 1870\r\nit was a comparatively rare disease in Germany, whereas in France it was\r\nquite common. This is indicated by the fact that in the years 1863–9 the\r\nnumber of deaths due to dysentery in the French army (home stations) was\r\ntwelve times as large as in the Prussian army. Particularly hard hit\r\nwere the troops in and around Metz, where dysentery raged continuously\r\nand with considerable severity,[245] as well as in Strassburg and Sedan;\r\nin the city and vicinity of Paris the disease, owing to the advanced\r\nseason of the year, raged less furiously. As a rule it was an open\r\nquestion whether the places in which the German troops contracted the\r\ndisease were already infected beforehand, or whether the disease had\r\nbeen brought there for the first time by infected divisions of the\r\nFrench army.\r\n\r\nOf the German field-army, 38,975 men, all told, contracted dysentery\r\n(47·8 per 1,000 of the average number of troops under arms), and of\r\nthese 2,405 died. Of the average number of French prisoners taken to\r\nGermany 41·7 per cent contracted the disease; nearly all the cases of\r\nthe disease were among the prisoners themselves, who brought the germ\r\nwith them, and the result was that the number of cases soon began to\r\ndecrease. It was, of course, inevitable that numerous prison-guards\r\nshould contract the disease, but nowhere did it spread in a serious way\r\nto the civil population.\r\n\r\nOf very great importance, as far as the war operations were concerned,\r\nwas the fact that typhus fever, which in former years had played such a\r\nfatal rôle, did not make its appearance among the troops; according to\r\nmost observers, the disease did not break out at all during the war. The\r\nPrussian troops along the Russian border were never entirely free from\r\ntyphus fever; according to the German Health Report, 91 soldiers\r\ncontracted the disease in the year 1867, 99 in the year 1868, and 37 in\r\nthe year 1869. France itself had apparently been free from the disease\r\nfor a long time, but there was always a possibility that it would be\r\nconveyed into the country from Algiers, where in the year 1868 a severe\r\nepidemic had raged in consequence of a great famine the year before; of\r\nthe army in Algiers the disease had carried away 252 men (3·94 per\r\ncent).[246] Consequently both the Germans and the French watched very\r\ncarefully any outbreaks of a disease involving symptoms of typhus fever.\r\nCases of a disease held by the authorities to be typhus fever were\r\nreported from Nancy, Châlons-sur-Marne, Lunéville, and Metz, but careful\r\ninvestigations by von Niemeyer indicate that they were merely cases of\r\ntyphoid fever exhibiting unusually well developed roseola. Several\r\nFrench physicians (Chauffard, Léon Colin, Kelsch) likewise testify to\r\nthe fact that typhus fever did not appear in the French army during the\r\nentire war. Grellois, to be sure, asserts that typhus fever broke out\r\nabout the middle of the siege of Metz and then suddenly disappeared. But\r\neven this assertion may fairly be questioned; at all events there was\r\nnot a single soldier in the garrison suffering from the disease at the\r\ntime of the capitulation, as Grellois himself admits.\r\n\r\nAccording to Michaux,[247] a former chairman of the Medical Society in\r\nMetz, a small epidemic of typhus fever raged among the civil inhabitants\r\nof that city during the siege. The correctness of this statement,\r\nhowever, is doubted, as no post-mortem examinations were made. It seems\r\nthat fifty-five children and nine nurses in two orphan asylums\r\ncontracted the disease, and that twenty-eight of the former and one of\r\nthe latter succumbed to it; the first cases of the disease were reported\r\nearly in October, and by the end of November the epidemic was over. This\r\nsudden disappearance of the disease was attributed by Michaux to the\r\ntermination of the siege, a conclusion also upheld by Méry, who studied\r\nthe disease in the Crimean War. Viry,[248] who until a few days before\r\nthe siege had charge of the field hospital in Vallières (near Metz),\r\nwhere he treated some 250–300 patients every day, performed autopsies on\r\nall supposed victims of typhus fever, but in all cases found only the\r\nevidences of typhoid fever. Nevertheless, he believes it possible that\r\ntyphus fever occurred there, and holds the view that the overcrowded\r\ncondition of the city favoured a spontaneous outbreak of the disease.\r\nLaveran,[249] who was also present in Metz during the siege, disputes\r\nthe correctness of Michaux’s diagnosis, as does the German Health\r\nReport, on the ground that the disease attacked children almost\r\nexclusively, that it caused such a high mortality, and that it\r\ndisappeared so suddenly. He seems to think that it was some acute\r\nexanthema, probably haemorrhagic measles. This leaves unexplained the\r\nfact that a large number of nurses contracted the disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n  III. THE GREAT EPIDEMIC OF SMALL-POX CAUSED BY THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR\r\n\r\nBut while typhoid fever and dysentery in the Franco-German War attacked\r\nthe civil population only in those parts of the country in which the\r\nfighting took place, and nowhere acquired epidemic dimensions, and while\r\nit is probable that typhus fever did not appear at all at that time,\r\nthere occurred in connexion with the war a very severe epidemic of\r\nsmall-pox, which raged more extensively and furiously than any other\r\nepidemic in the course of the entire century, and spread not only\r\nthroughout the belligerent countries, but also throughout all Europe.\r\n\r\nEverybody knows how severely Europe suffered from epidemics of small-pox\r\nin the last part of the eighteenth and first part of the nineteenth\r\ncenturies, and how the ravages of that disease were first checked by\r\nJenner’s wonderful discovery. Nevertheless, small-pox did not entirely\r\ndisappear from Central Europe until the year 1870. The reason for this\r\nis found in the fact that compulsory vaccination was introduced in only\r\na few states, and even in them was not properly enforced, and also in\r\nthe fact that people did not until later begin to realize that\r\nvaccination insures immunity only for a period of 12–15 years at most.\r\nConsequently new recruits, if they had already been vaccinated once,\r\nwere not revaccinated when they began to serve. But since sporadic\r\noutbreaks of small-pox continued to occur in the Prussian army, orders\r\nwere issued in the year 1834 that all recruits must be vaccinated. The\r\nresult was that from that time on, the Prussian troops were very rarely\r\nattacked by the disease. The same measure was adopted in Württemberg in\r\n1833, in Baden in 1840, in Bavaria in 1843, in Brunswick in 1858, in the\r\nKingdom of Saxony in 1868, and in the Grand Duchy of Hesse in 1869.\r\nCompulsory vaccination did not exist in Prussia or Saxony before the\r\nImperial Vaccination Law was passed in the year 1874; the result was\r\nthat large numbers of children were never vaccinated. The\r\nanti-vaccinationists, especially in the ‘sixties, carried on a vigorous\r\nagitation, and this had the effect of increasing the number of\r\nunvaccinated persons; the number of revaccinated persons had always been\r\nsmall. In South Germany compulsory vaccination for one-year-old children\r\nwas introduced in the first part of the nineteenth century—in Bavaria\r\nand Hesse in 1807, in Baden in 1815, in Württemberg in 1818—but\r\nrevaccination was not enforced until 1874, when the Imperial Vaccination\r\nLaw was passed.\r\n\r\nThe small-pox mortality in Prussia prior to the year 1870 is indicated\r\nby the following table, which shows the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants:\r\n\r\n                              1831–40 2·6\r\n                              1841–50 1·7\r\n                              1851–60 2·1\r\n                              1861–5  3·5\r\n                              1866–7  5·2\r\n                              1867–8  1·8\r\n                              1868–9  1·9\r\n                              1869–70 1·7\r\n\r\nIn the year 1864 an epidemic of small-pox had broken out, and the war of\r\n1866 had helped it to spread; but in the year 1868 the disease began to\r\nabate, so that by the middle of the year 1870 almost all of Prussia was\r\nfree from small-pox, as will be set forth in greater detail later on. In\r\nSouth Germany the small-pox mortality was even lower; in Bavaria it was\r\n0·85 in the years 1861–70, in Württemberg it was 0·9 in the same years,\r\nand in the Grand Duchy of Hesse it was 1·9 in the years 1866–70.[250]\r\n\r\n\r\n       1. _The Small-pox Mortality in France in the Years 1870–1_\r\n\r\nIn the ‘sixties small-pox had not been very common in France, but no\r\ndetailed reports regarding its prevalence there are available; the\r\nreports which the prefects were supposed to hand in are either entirely\r\nmissing, or else very incomplete. According to the statistics compiled\r\nby Vacher,[251] the death-rate increased a little in the years 1864–5,\r\nthen began to decrease, and in 1869 increased again. The figures which\r\nVacher compiled, and which the Académie de Médecine in Paris has on\r\nfile, are:\r\n\r\n                               1860 1,662\r\n                               1861 1,740\r\n                               1862 1,813\r\n                               1863 1,440\r\n                               1864 3,290\r\n                               1865 4,166\r\n                               1866   593\r\n                               1867 2,081\r\n                               1868 3,900\r\n                               1869 4,164\r\n\r\nVacher says in regard to these figures: ‘As far as the actual number of\r\npersons who contracted and succumbed to small-pox are concerned, they\r\nexpress only a small part of the truth. The reports submitted to the\r\nAcademy of Medicine are rarely complete; it is even necessary to say\r\nthat about one-quarter of the Departments never send in reports on the\r\nepidemics at all, although the ministerial instructions render the\r\nsubmission of these reports obligatory, and although the Academy never\r\nceases to protest against the negligence of the prefectoral\r\nadministrators.’ Vacher then goes on to say that in the years 1860–9\r\nonly 59 out of every 100 infants born were vaccinated, and that at the\r\noutbreak of the war about one-third of the French population was\r\nunvaccinated; in many Departments, indeed, as many as four-fifths\r\n(Aveyron, Corsica, &c.). Small-pox was much more prevalent in the French\r\narmy than in the German army; according to the German Health\r\nReport,[252] the number of deaths caused by the disease was:\r\n\r\n                PRUSSIAN ARMY.                   FRENCH ARMY.\r\n        _Total No._   _Per 10,000 men._ _Total No._  _Per 10,000 men._\r\n  1866              8              0.30           46              1.37\r\n  1867              2              0.08           70              1.82\r\n  1868              1              0.04          169              4.28\r\n  1869              1              0.04           95              2.27\r\n\r\nThe reason for this lies in the fact that a larger proportion of the\r\nPrussian soldiers were vaccinated. Since the year 1806 all French\r\nrecruits who had never been vaccinated were supposed to submit to the\r\ninoculation when they presented themselves for service, but this\r\nregulation was for years at a time very laxly enforced; consequently in\r\nthe year 1857 a new order was issued, introducing compulsory vaccination\r\nfor all recruits. But even this order does not seem to have been\r\neverywhere carried out with the necessary strictness, and complaints\r\nregarding the partial success of vaccination were frequently made by\r\nmilitary physicians.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, there was a noticeable increase in the small-pox\r\nmortality in the year 1869; this increase lasted into the beginning\r\nof the year 1870, but was confined to certain localities.\r\nChauffard’s[253] report on epidemic diseases in France is more\r\nincomplete for the years 1869–70, on account of the war, than for\r\nprevious years; it was supplemented, partially at least, by the\r\nlater reports of Vernois[254] for the year 1871, and also by the\r\ncomprehensive report of M. Delpech[255] for the years 1870–2.\r\nAccording to these, epidemics of small-pox occurred in the year 1869\r\nin North-west France (Bretagne), in North-east France (Departments\r\nof Aisne, Pas-de-Calais), and in South-east France (Departments of\r\nGers, Ariège, and Pyrénées-Orientales.) In the winter of 1869–70 the\r\nepidemic continued to spread, and by the end of the year 1870 it\r\nincluded almost the whole of France. The incomplete reports give us\r\nno idea as to which Departments were attacked before the outbreak of\r\nthe war and which after. According to Vernois, the disease appeared\r\nthat year in 42 Departments, including 132 arrondissements and 539\r\nparishes. But, as stated above, the reports are all very incomplete;\r\na later report submitted by Delpech adds 11 more Departments to the\r\n42. The total number of deaths caused by small-pox in France in the\r\nyear 1871 is unknown; Vernois reported 14,425 deaths in 39\r\nDepartments, but this does not include the figures for Paris, where\r\n10,539 persons succumbed to the disease, or for the Department of\r\nFinistère, or for the Department of Sarthe (in regard to which it is\r\nmerely observed that there were ‘beaucoup de morts’), or for several\r\nother Departments.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that small-pox raged severely among the civil inhabitants\r\nof all regions in which the second half of the war was waged (to the\r\nsouth, east, and north of Paris), and that the war itself helped the\r\ndisease to spread in the eastern Departments (Jura, Doubs,\r\nSaône-et-Loire, Haute-Saône). The wide prevalence of the disease among\r\nthe soldiers is attributed by many French physicians to the fact that\r\nthe army as a whole had been inadequately vaccinated. If this was true\r\nof the regular troops, lack of time made it absolutely impossible to\r\nvaccinate all the men that were afterwards assembled in such a\r\nprecipitate manner. The movements of the soldiers in the cold season of\r\nthe year (in December there was some bitterly cold weather) made it\r\nnecessary for friends and enemies to share whatever shelter they could\r\nfind, regardless of whether the house had previously been occupied by\r\nsmall-pox patients, or whether such patients were actually lying in it\r\nat the time. The result was that the disease became very widespread\r\nthroughout all France. Says Laveran:[256] ‘The army, being composed of\r\nmen who had been in service for a long time, and who had been vaccinated\r\nand revaccinated, suffered very little, but the events which took place\r\nafter the declaration of war altered this state of affairs. The\r\nregiments of the Departments on their way to Paris were quartered in the\r\nhomes of civilians, where they contracted small-pox. The disease spread\r\neasily among the young people who, owing to lack of time, had not been\r\nrevaccinated, and many of whom had perhaps never been vaccinated at all.\r\nDuring the first part of the siege of Paris it was these regiments which\r\nsuffered the most from small-pox, but later on the epidemic became more\r\ngeneral and spread to all the corps. The number of soldiers infected\r\nwith small-pox during the siege was about 6·76 per 100, or 68 per\r\n1,000.’\r\n\r\nSmall-pox raged very extensively in besieged strongholds. In Paris an\r\nepidemic of small-pox began in November 1869, and the number of deaths\r\ncaused by the disease there was:[257]\r\n\r\n                          October (1869)    39\r\n                          November          93\r\n                          December         119\r\n                          January          174\r\n                          February         293\r\n                          March            406\r\n                          April            561\r\n                          May              786\r\n                          June             914\r\n                          July           1,072\r\n                          August           713\r\n                          September        700\r\n                          October        1,361\r\n                          November       1,722\r\n                          December       1,837\r\n                          January        1,503\r\n                          February         763\r\n                          March            230\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the summer the disease was not very prevalent in the\r\ngarrison; most of the cases were among the civil inhabitants. This\r\ncondition changed in September, however, when the newly-organized mobile\r\nguard arrived in the city, consisting of young men who had not been\r\nrevaccinated for lack of time, and many of whom had never been\r\nvaccinated at all. A severe epidemic now began to rage throughout the\r\ngarrison; between October 1870 and March 1871 no less than 7,578 men\r\nsuffering from small-pox were taken to the Hôpital Bicêtre, where the\r\nmajority of the small-pox patients in the garrison were housed, and\r\nwhere 1,074 (14·17 per cent) of them died. Colin reports that the total\r\nnumber of small-pox patients taken there from the garrison (the total\r\nnumber of men in which he estimates at 70,000 regular troops and 100,000\r\nguardsmen)[258] was no less than 11,500, and that the number of deaths\r\nwas 1,600. In November, owing to the rapid dissemination of the disease\r\nin the garrison, the number of cases among the civil inhabitants also\r\nbegan to increase.\r\n\r\nSmall-pox also raged in Metz, but not so extensively as in Paris; the\r\nfollowing table indicates the number of men in the garrison carried away\r\nby small-pox:\r\n\r\n                           August (15–31)   6\r\n                           September       40\r\n                           October         51\r\n                           November        58\r\n                           December        21\r\n                                          ———\r\n                               Total      176\r\n\r\nThe surrender of the stronghold, on October 27, led to the discovery of\r\n200 small-pox patients in a tobacco factory. The epidemic among the\r\ncivil inhabitants came to an end in March 1871.\r\n\r\nBelfort, where the garrison consisted mostly of national guards, also\r\nexperienced a severe epidemic during the siege; likewise Strassburg,\r\nNancy, Toul, and Verdun.\r\n\r\nIn Strassburg, where cases of small-pox had repeatedly been observed,\r\nthe disease became more widespread in the summer of 1870, and during the\r\nsiege the number of cases increased considerably; not until August 1871\r\ndid the epidemic come to an end. According to Kriesche and Krieger,[259]\r\nthe number of civilians that succumbed to small-pox in Strassburg, the\r\npopulation of which in the year 1871 was 77,859, was:\r\n\r\n                                1869. 1870. 1871.\r\n                      January       2     4    81\r\n                      February      3     5    52\r\n                      March         3     9    20\r\n                      April        13    14    15\r\n                      May           1    19    14\r\n                      June          2    23     4\r\n                      July          6    22     3\r\n                      August        5    33     1\r\n                      September     2    66\r\n                      October            92\r\n                      November      2    72     1\r\n                      December      3    92\r\n                                   ——   ———   ———\r\n                        Total      42   451   191\r\n\r\nLangres was attacked with especial severity. The garrison there was\r\ncomposed of freshly enlisted troops (mobile and national guards), and\r\naveraged 14,629 men. The epidemic began in September 1870, and was not\r\nyet over by March 1871. The following table gives the number of cases\r\nand deaths according to Claudot.\r\n\r\n                            _No. cases._ _No. deaths._\r\n                  September           81            10\r\n                  October            145            12\r\n                  November           301            34\r\n                  December           598            41\r\n                  January            621            91\r\n                  February           402            93\r\n                  March              186            53\r\n                                   —————           ———\r\n                    Total          2,334           334\r\n\r\nThe disease raged very extensively in the French provincial armies that\r\nwere organized to relieve Paris—thus in the south-western, northern, and\r\nsouth-eastern scenes of the war, small-pox had already made its\r\nappearance among the civil inhabitants of those parts of the country in\r\nconsequence of the continual passing through of soldiers, many of whom\r\nhad never been vaccinated. Orléans, Chartres, and Le Mans, were the main\r\ncentres of the pestilence; in the north Amiens, Bois-Guillaume, Rouen,\r\nand other places; in the south, besides the strongholds of Belfort and\r\nLangres, the cities of Dijon, Besançon, Pontarlier, and several other\r\nplaces. The disease raged furiously throughout this entire region, but\r\nthe exact number of deaths is not known.\r\n\r\nIn south-eastern France, small-pox did not become very widespread until\r\nafter the outbreak of the war; in Lyons, for example, the epidemic began\r\nin the second half of October. To be sure, small-pox had appeared in\r\nseveral places in the year 1868, but by the winter of 1868–9 this\r\nepidemic was over, although individual cases continued to occur.\r\nRegarding the cause of the small-pox epidemic that broke out in Lyons in\r\nthe autumn of 1870, Fonteret[260] gives us the following information:\r\n‘Two causes could not help favouring the outbreak in our city; the\r\nmovements of the troops that took place at that time, and the emigration\r\nof numerous Parisians, who since the beginning of September, that is to\r\nsay, since the time when the epidemic began to rage furiously in Paris,\r\npassed through our city on their way to Switzerland.’ Regarding the\r\ncourse of the epidemic, no statistics covering the entire city are\r\navailable, but we are able to see from the following table, compiled by\r\nPerroud, the number of small-pox patients taken in by the Hôtel-Dieu and\r\nthe number that died there:\r\n\r\n                                   _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n               January-June (1870)         126         9\r\n               July-September              101        15\r\n               October                      29         8\r\n               November                     94        26\r\n               December                    160        37\r\n               January (1871)              148        31\r\n               February                    147        37\r\n               March                       135        29\r\n               April                       124        25\r\n               May                          84        12\r\n               June                         45         7\r\n               July                         38         5\r\n               August-December              44         6\r\n\r\nIn the other cantons of the Department 935 deaths were officially\r\nrecorded in the years 1870–1. It was observed in Lyons, as in other\r\nplaces, that not only the number of persons who contracted small-pox,\r\nbut also the virulence of the disease itself, increased; whereas only\r\n10.6 per cent of 227 sporadic cases resulted fatally between January and\r\nSeptember, out of 1,004 persons who contracted the disease between\r\nOctober 1870 and July 1871 no less than 21.7 per cent died.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1871 small-pox did not spare a single Department in France,\r\nalthough many of them failed to send in reports. Vacher estimates the\r\nnumber of deaths due to the disease in the year 1871 at 58,236, but he\r\nadds that the estimate is too small. No report, for example, was sent in\r\nby the Department of Sarthe, where in the city of Le Mans alone there\r\nwere 1,181 deaths, nor by the Department of Haute-Garonne, where there\r\nwere 1,328 deaths in Toulouse. The total number of unreported deaths,\r\ntherefore, must have been at least 20,000. It is almost impossible to\r\nestimate the number of deaths that occurred in the year 1870. From the\r\navailable statistics Vacher estimates the number of deaths caused by the\r\ndisease in the two years 1870–1 at 89,954, a figure, as he himself says,\r\n‘which represents only a part of the reality.’ Another estimate made by\r\nVacher, putting the number of deaths caused by small-pox in the years\r\n1869–70 at 200,000, is in all probability not an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1872, to be sure, small-pox appeared in the form of\r\nepidemics in numerous parts of France, but nowhere did it spread so\r\nwidely as in the two previous years. According to a report worked out by\r\nDelpech for the years 1870–2, no less than 42 Departments failed to make\r\nany report at all in the year 1872, while only 18 of the remaining 41\r\nDepartments sent in reports regarding epidemic outbreaks of small-pox.\r\nThe epidemic lasted until 1873, in which year reports regarding\r\nsmall-pox epidemics came in from 10 Departments; but only in the\r\nDepartments of Morbihan and Pyrénées-Orientales was the epidemic\r\napparently somewhat more intense.[261]\r\n\r\n\r\n               2. _Small-pox among the French Prisoners_\r\n\r\nThanks to the well-vaccinated condition of the German troops, the army\r\nsuffered comparatively little from small-pox. In the field army 4,385\r\nmen (61·3 per 1,000) contracted the disease, and 278 of them (3·5 per\r\ncent of those who contracted it) died. Including the officers,\r\nphysicians, and officials, the number taken sick was 4,991 and the\r\nnumber that died was 297. The number of men in the individual army corps\r\nthat contracted the disease varied greatly according to the nature and\r\nplace of their activity; particularly hard hit were the army divisions\r\nin the south-western and northern scenes of the war, where the military\r\noperations were carried on in fearfully cold weather, and where it was\r\nimpossible to quarter the infected soldiers in isolated places by\r\nthemselves. The French army was attacked much more severely by\r\nsmall-pox, although there are no accurate reports available regarding\r\nthe prevalence of the disease. According to a report found in the\r\n_Vienna Medical Weekly_,[262] the total number of French soldiers that\r\nsuccumbed to small-pox was 23,469[263]; but the accuracy of this number,\r\nto be sure, is questionable, since, assuming that there was a very high\r\nmortality, it would mean that some 120,000 troops contracted the\r\ndisease. At all events, the French army, taken as a whole, was badly\r\ninfected with small-pox, and it was inevitable that among the French\r\nprisoners brought to Germany there should be numerous small-pox\r\npatients, some in the incubation stage, and some in the convalescent\r\nstage of the disease, and that they should infect other people there.\r\n\r\nThe number of French prisoners taken to Germany in the first few months\r\nof the year 1871 was no less than 372,918; the prisoners who at the very\r\nbeginning, but especially after the surrender of Metz, were transported\r\nin large numbers to Germany, had to be distributed throughout the entire\r\nEmpire, clear over to the eastern boundary. Owing to the fact that new\r\ntransports of French prisoners were constantly arriving at the German\r\nfrontier, which, in consequence of severe hardships and privations, they\r\nreached in such a weak physical condition that they could not be taken\r\nvery far inland, it became necessary to transfer some of the earlier\r\narrivals to other places of detention, and this, of course, favoured the\r\nfurther dissemination of the disease. This transference was rendered\r\nparticularly necessary by the arrival of large numbers of prisoners\r\nafter the battle of Sedan (September 1), after the capitulation of Metz\r\n(October 27), and after the battles of Orléans and Le Mans (December and\r\nJanuary respectively). Small-pox occasionally broke out among these\r\nprisoners while they were on their way to Germany, rendering it\r\nnecessary to leave them behind, or else the disease made its appearance\r\nwhen they reached their destination; as a rule, however, the first cases\r\nof the disease were observed a few days after their arrival at their\r\nplace of detention, where they soon infected the other prisoners. The\r\nfurther dissemination of the disease among them was checked by means of\r\nwholesale vaccination.\r\n\r\nOf the prisoners, 14,178, all told (38 per cent of the total number\r\ntaken), contracted small-pox, and of these 1,963 (5·26 per cent) died.\r\nThe statistics in the German Health Report indicate distinctly the\r\nnumber of prisoners in the various states and provinces that contracted\r\nand succumbed to the disease; but the total number of prisoners taken is\r\nknown only in the case of the larger states in the Confederation, since\r\nthe statistics in the Report are compiled on the basis of the army-corps\r\ndistricts, which do not coincide with the political divisions. The\r\nfigures for the larger states are as follows:\r\n\r\n              _Maximum\r\n                 no.                              _Patients  _Deaths per\r\n             prisoners._ _Patients._  _Deaths._  per 1,000._ 100 cases._\r\n N.

The latter, to\r\nbe sure, were no less exposed to the infection, but the former, taken as\r\na whole, were not nearly so well vaccinated; for it was impossible in\r\nthe short time available to see to it that all the reserves were\r\nvaccinated, since the troops designated for the field were given the\r\nprecedence. Thus between conscription and vaccination there was more or\r\nless of an interval, during which a large number of the reserves were\r\nnot protected against the disease. The total number of men in the\r\nimmobile army that contracted small-pox was 3,472 (excluding Baden and\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Hesse, regarding which we have no statistics).\r\nAssuming that the average number of reserves in the immobile army was\r\n300,424, this means that about 11·6 per 1,000 contracted the disease.\r\nThe number of cases among the immobile troops in the individual states\r\nof the Confederation varied greatly, as indicated by the following\r\ntable:\r\n\r\n              _Average\r\n                 no.                              _Patients  _Deaths per\r\n             reserves._  _Patients._  _Deaths._  per 1,000._ 100 cases._\r\n N.

The relative\r\nnumber of small-pox cases in the latter table, accordingly, is somewhat\r\ntoo low. Among the prisoners and among the immobile troops, the climax\r\nof the pestilence was in January, as indicated by the following table:\r\n\r\n                     _French Prisoners._ _Immobile German troops._\r\n      July (1870)                      2                        16\r\n      August                          27                         9\r\n      September                       85                        47\r\n      October                        273                        49\r\n      November                     1,041                       128\r\n      December                     3,107                       358\r\n      January (1871)               4,139                       802\r\n      February                     3,151                       719\r\n      March                        1,521                       457\r\n      April                          586                       451\r\n      May                            209                       291\r\n      June                            36                       145\r\n\r\nThe number of French prisoners taken to Germany in the month of July\r\n1870 was small. Of the sixteen immobiles who contracted the disease\r\nduring that month, nine belonged to the Ninth Army Corps, most of them\r\nhaving been infected inland before the outbreak of the war. That the\r\nmonth of July did not constitute the starting-point of the subsequent\r\nepidemic is evident from the fact that the prevalence of the disease\r\ndecreased in August, as well as from countless individual observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  4. _The Epidemic of Small-pox in the Civil Population of Germany in\r\n                                1871–2_\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1870 Germany was almost free from small-pox. Later on,\r\nthousands of French prisoners, almost all of them hailing from infected\r\nlocalities, were within a short time scattered throughout the entire\r\nGerman Empire, and since the inhabitants of many parts of the country,\r\nas stated above, were very insufficiently vaccinated, it was inevitable\r\nthat epidemics of small-pox should break out everywhere. The disease was\r\ndisseminated in several ways: by prisoners who had contracted it on\r\ntheir way to Germany, or who had to be transported from an infected to\r\nan uninfected locality, by persons into whose systems the infection had\r\nentered but had not yet revealed its presence, and by uninfected persons\r\nwho had come in contact with infected persons; numerous persons,\r\nmoreover, contracted the disease by handling the clothing, blankets, and\r\nother effects of small-pox patients.\r\n\r\n‘The dissemination of the disease,’ says the German Health Report,[264]\r\n‘which broke out simultaneously in various parts of Germany, was helped\r\nalong in numerous ways. From the lazarets and from the prisons it was\r\ncommunicated by nurses and guards, and by working men and tradesmen, to\r\nthe civil population and to the local garrison, and from there it spread\r\nto the surrounding country. It was conveyed from place to place, often\r\nconsiderable distances, by the moving population itself, not\r\ninfrequently by marching troops, and particularly by the removal of\r\nprisoners from one place of detention to another; the latter measure had\r\nto be adopted in order to make room for the fresh transports of\r\nprisoners that were constantly arriving, many of them in such an\r\nexhausted condition that it was necessary to spare them the long and\r\ntrying journey to the far East. Thus the prisons at Mayence, Coblenz,\r\nWesel, Minden, &c. became the foci from which the disease was\r\ntransplanted into hitherto uninfected places.’\r\n\r\nThe result was that there broke out in Germany an epidemic of small-pox\r\nwhich raged more furiously and extensively than any other epidemic in\r\nthe course of the nineteenth century. Whereas among the prisoners-of-war\r\nand among the immobile German troops (who were particularly exposed to\r\nthe infection) the disease reached its climax as early as January 1871,\r\namong the civil inhabitants of the country this climax did not come\r\nuntil later in the year; in the more out-of-the-way regions, moreover,\r\nwhere there was less intercourse, the height of the epidemic was not\r\nreached until the year 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(a) The Dissemination of Small-pox in Prussia and in the smaller North\r\n                             German States_\r\n\r\nAfter the prevalence of small-pox in Prussia had again increased\r\nsomewhat in the years 1864–7, in the following years the number of cases\r\nof the disease grew steadily smaller, so that around the middle of the\r\nyear 1870 the country was practically free from it. Its prevalence again\r\nincreased in the first months of the year 1871. The following table\r\nindicates the number of deaths caused by the disease in Prussia in the\r\ncourse of twelve years:\r\n\r\n             _Total no. deaths._ _Deaths per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n       1862                3,894                              2·1\r\n       1863                6,250                              3·4\r\n       1864                8,904                              4·6\r\n       1865                8,403                              4·4\r\n       1866               11,937                              6·2\r\n       1867                8,500                              4·3\r\n       1868                4,510                              1·8\r\n       1869                4,655                              1·9\r\n       1870                4,200                              1·7\r\n       1871               59,839                             24·3\r\n       1872          66,660[265]                             26·9\r\n       1873                8,932                              3·6\r\n\r\nIn the year 1874 only one person per 10,000 inhabitants succumbed to the\r\ndisease. Among the French prisoners small-pox usually broke out very\r\nsoon after their arrival at their place of detention, while among the\r\ninhabitants of the places in which the prisons were located it usually\r\ndid not make its appearance until several months later. Guttstadt,[266]\r\nin his excellent work on the _Epidemic of Small-pox in Prussia in the\r\nYears 1870–1_, has compiled a table of statistics indicating in a number\r\nof places when the disease first made its appearance among the prisoners\r\nand among the civil inhabitants. We reproduce this table below, with a\r\nfew small alterations. In some of the places mentioned there was no\r\nmilitary prison; only prisoners suffering from small-pox were taken to\r\nthem, usually resulting in an epidemic of the disease among the civil\r\ninhabitants. The table clearly indicates the connexion between the\r\nsmall-pox epidemics among the civil inhabitants and the outbreaks of the\r\ndisease among the prisoners; regarding the manner of dissemination in\r\nthe case of the individual epidemics we shall have more to say further\r\non.\r\n\r\n   THE APPEARANCE OF SMALL-POX AMONG PRISONERS-OF-WAR AND AMONG THE CIVIL\r\n            INHABITANTS IN THE

The figures\r\n for the year 1872 have not been published; they were placed at my\r\n disposal, in manuscript form, by the Royal Prussian Bureau of Statistics.\r\n ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n\r\nThe small-pox mortality varied greatly in the different Prussian\r\nGovernmental Districts; particularly noteworthy is the fact that it\r\nwas considerably higher in the eastern provinces, especially in the\r\nyear 1872, than in the western provinces, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat the latter were exposed to the infection much sooner and much\r\nmore frequently in consequence of the arrival and passing through of\r\nFrench prisoners. The only plausible explanation of this is the fact\r\nthat the inhabitants of eastern Prussia were not so thoroughly\r\nvaccinated as those in the west; this, however, was not because the\r\nanti-vaccinationists were more influential in the east, but because\r\nthe eastern provinces had fewer physicians than the western provinces,\r\nwhere medical advice and help were far more accessible, and where the\r\npopulation was more enlightened. The effect of vaccination is clearly\r\nrevealed in those Governmental Districts in the west which introduced\r\ncompulsory vaccination before they were incorporated into Prussia;\r\nSchleswig-Holstein did this in 1811, Hanover in 1821, the Governmental\r\nDistrict of Wiesbaden in 1820, and the Governmental District of Cassel\r\nin 1828. All these parts of the country had fewer cases of small-pox.\r\nThe Governmental Districts in which large military prisons were\r\nlocated, and those in which, owing to a higher industrial development,\r\nthere was more intercourse of all kinds, were attacked earlier by\r\nsmall-pox than the others. Of the western provinces only the two\r\nhighly industrial districts of Arnsberg and Düsseldorf, and the\r\ndistrict of Trèves, were very severely attacked. The living conditions\r\namong the working people were not so good at that time as they are\r\nto-day, and the close quarters must necessarily have favoured the\r\ndissemination of small-pox; furthermore, the constant moving about of\r\nthe working inhabitants, many of whom did not live where they were\r\nemployed, helped to spread it. Thus it was observed in the vicinity of\r\nLeipzig, that the villages inhabited by working people were much more\r\nseverely attacked by small-pox than those inhabited by farmers, with\r\ntheir stationary and settled population. The high figures in the case\r\nof the Governmental District of Trèves may be explained by the fact\r\nthat its location made it necessary for a large proportion of the\r\nFrench prisoners that were taken into Prussia to pass through it. The\r\nnumber of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the various Governmental\r\nDistricts of Prussia is indicated by the following table (the\r\ndistricts which introduced compulsory vaccination in the year 1870 are\r\ndesignated with an asterisk):\r\n\r\n               _Governmental District._ 1870. 1871. 1872.\r\n               Königsberg                 3·5  24·5  37·8\r\n               Gumbinnen                  4·1   9·7  40·0\r\n               Danzig                     2·8  42·4  67·6\r\n               Marienwerder               3·7  17·7  76·2\r\n               Berlin                     2·1  63·1  31·4\r\n               Potsdam                    1·8  25·8  28·7\r\n               Frankfurt                  0·1  18·6  40·0\r\n               Stettin                    1·6  29·9  21·4\r\n               Köslin                     2·2  12·2  36·7\r\n               Stralsund                  0·2  34·0   3·9\r\n               Posen                      6·0  48·3  58·0\r\n               Bromberg                   5·3  24·1  86·6\r\n               Breslau                    3·1  27·5  33·6\r\n               Oppeln                     1·7  22·5  42·1\r\n               Liegnitz                   0·5  11·2  16·8\r\n               Magdeburg                  0·6  27·5  16·3\r\n               Merseburg                  1·0  28·8  20·2\r\n               Erfurt                     1·4  25·3  14·4\r\n               Schleswig-Holstein*        0·2  18·0   5·0\r\n               Hanover*                   0·3   5·3   8·8\r\n               Hildesheim*                0·1  13·8  19·6\r\n               Lüneburg*                  0·2   7·8   6·5\r\n               Stade*                     1·3   5·6   4·9\r\n               Osnabrück*                 0·3   6·0   0·8\r\n               Aurich*                    0·0   5·4   1·1\r\n               Münster                    0·3  11·6  10·8\r\n               Minden                     0·2  13·4   8·9\r\n               Arnsberg                   0·4  39·1  33·8\r\n               Cassel*                    0·5   9·0   6·2\r\n               Wiesbaden*                 1·7   9·7   2·5\r\n               Coblenz                    1·2  22·8   6·6\r\n               Düsseldorf                 0·3  32·9  20·5\r\n               Cologne                    1·4  14·6   2·8\r\n               Trèves                     2·5  34·0   3·1\r\n               Aix-la-Chapelle            0·8  14·5   7·8\r\n               Hohenzollern               1·7  19·9\r\n\r\nIn East Prussia small-pox broke out very frequently in the city and\r\nvicinity of Königsberg. According to Guttstadt, small-pox patients, in\r\nconsequence of the proximity of the Russian border, kept coming to the\r\nhospital in Königsberg, into which twelve persons suffering from the\r\ndisease were received between January 1 and August 1, 1870. The first\r\nprisoners-of-war arrived at Königsberg on August 15, 1870, and among\r\nthem was a small-pox patient. Shortly afterwards two more cases of the\r\ndisease occurred among the prisoners. The first case among the civil\r\npopulation occurred in the hospital on September 2. Owing to the\r\nconstant intercourse between the prisoners and the civil inhabitants the\r\nepidemic spread very rapidly. The districts surrounding Königsberg were\r\nvery severely attacked in the year 1871, while the more remote\r\ndistricts, especially those along the boundary of West Prussia, were not\r\nattacked until the year 1872. In the districts around Königsberg the\r\nmortality per 10,000 inhabitants was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                         1871. 1872.\r\n                   Königsberg (city)      49·8   3·6\r\n                   Königsberg (vicinity)  78·4  13·3\r\n                   Labiau                 42·4  30·6\r\n                   Wehlau                103·1   8·9\r\n                   Insterburg             32·2  47·3\r\n                   Fischhausen            38·7  17·9\r\n\r\nIn the districts of East Prussia more remote from Königsberg the\r\nfollowing number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants were reported:\r\n\r\n                                     1871. 1872.\r\n                       Memel           5·5  37·0\r\n                       Gerdauen       18·9  53·1\r\n                       Rastenburg     65·9  26·8\r\n                       Friedland      13·7  35·5\r\n                       Eylau          15·2  29·7\r\n                       Heiligenbeil   19·7   8·1\r\n                       Braunsberg      2·9  10·1\r\n                       Heilsberg       6·3  27·2\r\n                       Rössel         25·7  52·2\r\n                       Allenstein      7·4 108·5\r\n                       Ortelsburg     20·6 124·4\r\n                       Neidenburg      1·7  45·6\r\n                       Osterode        4·7  76·5\r\n                       Mohrungen       2·1  36·2\r\n                       Prus.

Says\r\nLiévin:[267] ‘For a considerable length of time no cases of small-pox\r\noccurred in Danzig, but in the month of September 1870 the beginnings of\r\nan epidemic were observed. Although this happened shortly after the\r\narrival of the first prisoners, nevertheless the beginning of the\r\nepidemic was probably not connected in any causal way with this\r\ncircumstance. For, in the first place, the prisoners were French\r\nsoldiers captured in the battles of Weissenburg and Wörth, and were in\r\nall probability healthy men, judging from the fact that not a single\r\ncase of the disease occurred among them in the first few months; in the\r\nsecond place, the disease broke out very sporadically in the first three\r\nor four months, individual outbreaks occurring here and there in the\r\ncity, just as has been the case in Danzig almost every year. But during\r\nthis indigenous pestilence a large number of badly infected prisoners\r\narrived from the Metz garrison; this gave rise to an epidemic which, had\r\nthe prisoners not arrived, would probably have progressed in the usual,\r\nscarcely noticeable manner; as it was, however, the epidemic attained to\r\nthe largest dimensions known to the memory of man.’\r\n\r\nAccording to Liévin, the total number of small-pox cases in Danzig and\r\nits suburbs (including the garrison and the prisoners-of-war) was:\r\n\r\n                   1870.                 1871.                 1872.\r\n           _Patients._ _Deaths._ _Patients._ _Deaths._ _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n January                                 123        24         245        77\r\n February                                129        28         222        77\r\n March                                   201        51         153        75\r\n April                                   365        70          89        33\r\n May                                     459       109          34        17\r\n June                                    442       123          19        12\r\n July                                    182        71          13         3\r\n August                                  130        49           8         7\r\n September           2                   111        37           5         2\r\n October             4         2         124        57           2\r\n November           13         2         136        42\r\n December           34         3         135        39\r\n\r\nOf the 9,189 prisoners in Danzig, 188 contracted the disease, and 24\r\ndied; the largest number of cases was reported in the month of January.\r\nOf the garrison, which consisted of 7,376 men, only 45 contracted the\r\ndisease,[268] and 5 died.\r\n\r\nAs in East Prussia, so also in West Prussia, only those districts\r\nsuffered severely from small-pox in which large military prisons were\r\nlocated; in the remaining districts the pestilence did not acquire much\r\nseverity until the following year. Of the three strongholds, Danzig,\r\nThorn, and Graudenz, the last two had but few cases of small-pox among\r\nthe prisoners; in the districts surrounding them the following number of\r\ndeaths per 1,000 inhabitants were reported:\r\n\r\n                                       1871. 1872.\r\n                     Danzig (city)      79·6  35·9\r\n                     Danzig (district)  91·2  59·2\r\n                     Prussian Stargard  55·5 105·0\r\n                     Rosenberg          40·5  66·5\r\n                     Thorn              46·0  41·7\r\n\r\nIn the remaining districts of West Prussia the mortality due to\r\nsmall-pox was as follows:\r\n\r\n                                     1871. 1872.\r\n                       Elbing         18·7  71·8\r\n                       Marienburg     16·0  68·6\r\n                       Berent          6·6  47·7\r\n                       Karthaus        7·7  67·9\r\n                       Neustadt       22·9  89·0\r\n                       Stuhm          21·4  97·8\r\n                       Marienwerder   21·3  62·3\r\n                       Löbau           4·9  88·0\r\n                       Strassburg      6·1  80·7\r\n                       Kulm           25·9  65·5\r\n                       Graudenz        5·4  55·9\r\n                       Schwetz        11·0 118·6\r\n                       Konitz          9·7  79·7\r\n                       Schlochau       6·9  69·5\r\n                       Flatow         23·4  74·1\r\n                       Deutsch-Krone  10·2  92·1\r\n\r\nAll these districts, especially Prussian-Stargard and Schwetz, which lay\r\nside by side along the Vistula, had an unusually high mortality in the\r\nyear 1872.\r\n\r\nThe Governmental District of Posen, in the Province of Posen, was much\r\nmore severely attacked by small-pox in the year 1871 than the\r\nGovernmental District of Bromberg, whereas in the year 1872 the\r\ncondition was reversed. In the former district cases of small-pox had\r\noccurred even before a transport of French prisoners arrived there in\r\nthe middle of September; in that month two of the prisoners contracted\r\nthe disease, and these two cases constituted the beginning of a large\r\nepidemic among the prisoners. According to Guttstadt, the epidemic among\r\nthe civil inhabitants did not commence until February 1872, and it\r\nlasted until the middle of that year. The districts along the boundary\r\nof Posen (Schroda, Wreschen, Schrimm, Kosten, and Samter) had the\r\nlargest number of cases and deaths in the year 1871, whereas in the\r\nremaining, more distant, districts the figures for the year 1871 are for\r\nthe most part small, and do not begin to grow large until the year 1872.\r\nThe following table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants in the districts mentioned:\r\n\r\n                                       1871. 1872.\r\n                      Posen (city)      82·5   4·4\r\n                      Posen (district) 103·2  53·0\r\n                      Schroda          105·6  61·3\r\n                      Wreschen         116·5  63·1\r\n                      Schrimm           61·5  88·4\r\n                      Kosten            75·9  72·4\r\n                      Samter            66·9  83·4\r\n                      Pleschen          17·9  56·7\r\n                      Buk               38·2  42·2\r\n                      Obornik           22·2  76·3\r\n                      Birnbaum          15·4  63·6\r\n                      Meseritz          13·0  53·3\r\n                      Bomst             20·5  34·1\r\n                      Fraustadt         21·5  26·0\r\n                      Gröben            55·8  79·5\r\n                      Krotoschin        22·1  62·0\r\n                      Adelnau           26·3  29·4\r\n                      Schildberg        14·6  91·6\r\n\r\nThe first prisoners that contracted small-pox in the city of Bromberg\r\nwere committed to the lazaret on December 15; the epidemic among the\r\ncivil inhabitants began there on February 10, 1871. The figures for 1871\r\nwere higher than those for 1872 in only three districts—Bromberg itself,\r\nthe adjacent Schubin, and Czarnikau; the last-named district lies in the\r\nwest and borders on Samter in the Governmental District of Posen. All\r\nthe other districts that are not mentioned had higher figures in the\r\nyear 1872. The following table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants in the districts named:\r\n\r\n                                    1871. 1872.\r\n                        Czarnikau    47·0  69·8\r\n                        Wirsitz      14·7  65·4\r\n                        Bromberg     89·7  72·3\r\n                        Schubin      59·4  96·5\r\n                        Inowrazlaw   20·4 102·5\r\n                        Mogilno      22·6  96·5\r\n                        Chlodziesen  24·7  79·7\r\n                        Wongrowitz   26·3 153·1\r\n                        Gnesen       32·9  56·0\r\n\r\nOf the prisoners in the Governmental District of Liegnitz, those in the\r\nstronghold of Glogau were the most severely attacked. In the garrison,\r\ntoo, the number of small-pox patients was quite large. The first\r\nprisoners arrived on September 1, and the first cases of small-pox among\r\nthem appeared on September 16; the maximum number of prisoners there was\r\n13,621, and of these 1,198 contracted the disease. The first case among\r\nthe civil inhabitants was reported on October 7; in December the disease\r\nwas conveyed to the surrounding villages, especially by tradespeople who\r\nhad visited the markets in Glogau. The adjacent districts suffered\r\nrelatively little in the year 1871. In the governmental district of\r\nLiegnitz, with the exception of Glogau, where there were 31·2 deaths per\r\n10,000 inhabitants, only Görlitz and Liegnitz had high figures in the\r\nyear 1871. In the city of Görlitz a prisoner was committed to the\r\nlazaret in November 1870, and in December, when a transport of prisoners\r\npassed through the city, one of them was left behind there; the epidemic\r\namong the civil inhabitants began in January 1871. Again in the year\r\n1872 small-pox did not become very widespread except in the districts of\r\nLiegnitz, Jauer, Hirschberg, and Görlitz; Liegnitz, with a mortality of\r\n35·2 per 10,000 inhabitants, had the highest figures.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Breslau cases of small-pox were\r\nfrequently reported. In the city of Breslau the first case among the\r\nprisoners occurred on November 11, the second on January 27, the third\r\nand fourth in April and May, 1871; the first cases in the garrison\r\nlikewise occurred in November; from January on, the number of cases grew\r\nsteadily larger. The number of reported cases in the city was:[269]\r\n\r\n                            January      33\r\n                            February     68\r\n                            March        90\r\n                            April        68\r\n                            May         134\r\n                            June        235\r\n                            July        287\r\n                            August      271\r\n                            September   361\r\n                            October     699\r\n                            November  1,026\r\n                            December  1,229\r\n                            January   1,311\r\n                            February    790\r\n                            March       462\r\n                            April       242\r\n\r\nThe epidemic was very severe. Whereas during the previous epidemics\r\n(1856–7, 1863–4, and 1868–9) only about seven per cent of the patients\r\ntreated in the hospital died, in 1871–2 no less than 322 out of 2,416\r\npatients (13·4 per cent) taken there were carried away by the disease.\r\nOf the 322 patients, moreover, 182 had hemorrhagic small-pox, and of\r\nthese 166 died.\r\n\r\nThe immediate vicinity of Breslau was very severely attacked; in the\r\ndistricts lying to the south of the Oder small-pox raged extensively in\r\nthe year 1871, whereas those districts on the north side of the river\r\ndid not suffer very severely until the year 1872. This may be explained\r\nby the fact that the extensive industrial activity of the districts\r\nsouth-west of the Oder rendered considerable intercourse with Breslau\r\nnecessary. The following table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants in the districts north-east of the Oder:\r\n\r\n                                    1871. 1872.\r\n                         Namslau      4·0  48·5\r\n                         Wartenberg  14·0  55·4\r\n                         Oels        22·3  71·0\r\n                         Trebnitz     8·6  27·8\r\n                         Militsch    10·0  37·2\r\n                         Gurau       15·5  20·2\r\n                         Steinau     12·1  34·2\r\n                         Wohlau      41·1  38·4\r\n\r\nand in the districts south-west of the Oder:\r\n\r\n                                        1871. 1872.\r\n                     Neumarkt            13·5  61·5\r\n                     Breslau (city)      35·7  27·3\r\n                     Breslau (district)  57·3  74·9\r\n                     Ohlau               12·2  23·3\r\n                     Brieg                5·2  17·2\r\n                     Strehlau            30·3  33·8\r\n                     Nimptsch            23·5  37·4\r\n                     Münsterberg         53·0  29·0\r\n                     Frankenstein        34·3  14·3\r\n                     Reichenbach         32·0  19·8\r\n                     Schweidnitz         26·3  13·4\r\n                     Striegau            16·9  48·2\r\n                     Waldenburg          57·7  36·2\r\n                     Glatz               39·1  13·4\r\n                     Neurode             20·2  35·6\r\n                     Habelschwerdt        8·2   7·3\r\n\r\nIn Upper Silesia the stronghold of Neisse had a maximum number of 12,801\r\nprisoners, among whom there were 385 cases of small-pox and 117 deaths;\r\nin the garrison, which averaged 4,452 men, there were 39 cases and 1\r\ndeath. The first cases among the prisoners were reported on September\r\n25, and in the garrison in November. The civil inhabitants suffered very\r\nlittle in the year 1871, and the number of deaths among them did not\r\nbegin to grow large until 1872. Only in the district of Neisse and in\r\nthe neighbouring district of Grottkau was the number of deaths larger in\r\n1871 than in 1872; in all the other districts there were more deaths in\r\n1872. The districts which were most severely attacked in the year 1872\r\nwere—Kreuzburg (78·2 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants), Posenberg (58·6),\r\nGross-Strelitz (60·0), Beuthen (56·5), and Kosel (62·4).\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Pomerania the city of Stettin came to be a general\r\nrendezvous for prisoners of war; the maximum number of them, owing to\r\nthe continual arrival of new transports, was no less than 21,000. The\r\nfirst transport arrived on August 12, and the first small-pox patient\r\namong them was committed to the hospital on August 28. Of the prisoners,\r\n1,303 contracted the disease and 194 succumbed to it. The climax of the\r\nepidemic came in January, when there were 462 cases reported. The first\r\ncases in the garrison, which averaged 7,000 men, occurred in October,\r\nthe first man to contract the disease being a sick-attendant, and the\r\nsecond an artilleryman; after that, all the branches of service were\r\nattacked. The epidemic in the garrison, however, was confined to 74 men,\r\nonly 5 of whom died. In December the disease spread to the civil\r\npopulation; the number of cases (including the garrison) was 422 (55·5\r\nper 10,000) in the year 1871, and 113 (14·8 per 10,000) in the following\r\nyear. In the Governmental District of Stettin only the communities\r\nsurrounding the city of Stettin had high small-pox figures in the year\r\n1871, and these communities were also more severely attacked in the year\r\n1872. The following table indicates the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants in the communities mentioned:\r\n\r\n                                     1871. 1872.\r\n                       Demmin          1·1   2·6\r\n                       Anklam          4·3  15·8\r\n                       Usedom-Wollin  16·4  16·2\r\n                       Uckermünde     24·7  26·4\r\n                       Randow         70·4  29·3\r\n                       Greifenhagen   37·8  26·3\r\n                       Pyritz         15·3  23·1\r\n                       Saazig         27·8  27·4\r\n                       Naugard        32·4  32·6\r\n                       Kammin         10·3  13·3\r\n                       Greifenberg     4·3  10·4\r\n                       Regenwalde     16·4  27·5\r\n\r\nAt the stronghold of Kolberg (Governmental District of Köslin) 3,500\r\nprisoners arrived on November 4, and in December and January they were\r\nfollowed by the arrival of more transports. The first cases among these\r\nprisoners were reported on November 14; all told, 175 of them contracted\r\nsmall-pox and 24 succumbed to it. On January 7 the disease spread to the\r\ncivil population, but did not rage very extensively in the city; 127\r\ncivilians contracted it and 24 succumbed to it, and in August 1871 it\r\ndisappeared; only two men in the garrison were taken sick. Many of the\r\nprisoners in Kolberg were transported to Stettin, Köslin, and Stolp, and\r\nin all three of these places the disease broke out among the civil\r\ninhabitants. In Schivelbein an infected soldier was found among the\r\nprisoners who arrived on January 24, 1871, and on January 26 he was\r\ncommitted to the lazaret; in February a working-man contracted the\r\ndisease in the same lazaret, and after that the epidemic spread\r\nthroughout the city and did not disappear until October 1872; it carried\r\naway a relatively large number of people and spread to two neighbouring\r\nvillages. But taking the Governmental District of Köslin as a whole, it\r\nmay be said that the dissemination of small-pox was moderate; the\r\ndistrict of Schlawe had the largest number of deaths (22·7 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants). On the other hand, in the year 1872 small-pox caused a\r\nvery large number of deaths in the districts of Neustettin, Dramburg,\r\nSchlawe, Rummelsburg, and Stolp.\r\n\r\nThe number of cases of the disease in the Governmental District of\r\nStralsund was very large. Small-pox broke out very severely among the\r\nFrench prisoners in the city of Stralsund, the maximum number of whom\r\nwas 2,991; of these 234 contracted the disease and 35 succumbed to it.\r\nThe prisoners arrived on December 4, and among them was a small-pox\r\npatient; he was committed to the lazaret on December 9. In the garrison,\r\nwhich averaged 3,700 men, there were only thirty-one cases of the\r\ndisease and one death. The first case among the civil inhabitants\r\noccurred on January 7; the patient was a clerk who lived near the\r\nlazaret and had had more or less intercourse with the prisoners. Of\r\ntwenty-three more cases that occurred before January 15, at least six\r\nwere shown to be directly attributable to the epidemic among the\r\nprisoners; one of the six was a sick-attendant, two were working-men in\r\nthe military lazaret, and the other three were members of the families\r\nof attendants. The epidemic then became very widespread; to the end of\r\nthe year 1871 the number of deaths was 366, and the number of reported\r\ncases was 1,807. In Greifswald a French prisoner contracted small-pox on\r\nOctober 18, 1870, in the military reserve lazaret, another on November\r\n1, and a third on November 16. The first civilian, an attendant,\r\ncontracted the disease on December 13, and on January 6, 1871, a\r\nworking-man, who had transported the attendant from the military lazaret\r\nto the town small-pox hospital, was taken sick. Until February 14, ten\r\nmore cases were reported, and then the epidemic began. Up to the end of\r\nthe year 1871 no less than 578 cases of the disease and 111 deaths\r\ncaused by it were reported to the authorities. In the year 1872 there\r\nwere only a few deaths caused by small-pox throughout the entire\r\nGovernmental District of Stralsund.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the two adjacent confederate states of\r\nMecklenburg-Schwerin and Mecklenburg-Strelitz no small-pox mortality\r\nstatistics are available. On September 20, prisoners from Metz were\r\ntaken to the reserve lazaret in Schwerin, and among them was a small-pox\r\npatient who died eight days later. In the same month an assistant in the\r\nlazaret was taken sick, and in October and December two more members of\r\nthe lazaret staff contracted the disease. The pestilence spread to the\r\ncivil population because the attendants who were commissioned to dispose\r\nof the effects of the dead, instead of destroying them, sold or gave\r\nthem to the inhabitants. The epidemic, which spread rapidly throughout\r\nthe surrounding country, was quite severe and lasted until March 1871.\r\nIn Wismar two cases of small-pox were reported among the prisoners in\r\nDecember, and these were followed by six more cases in January and\r\nFebruary; in the garrison, which averaged 1,219 men, there were 48 cases\r\nof the disease (5 in January, 32 in February, 9 in March, and 2 in\r\nApril); 3 of the 48 were fatal. At Rostock 649 prisoners arrived on\r\nNovember 11, and these were followed by 544 more on December 14; among\r\nthe latter there were two small-pox patients, and in the course of the\r\nnext few months forty-one more cases of the disease and six deaths were\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nBerlin suffered severely from an epidemic of small-pox in the years\r\n1871–2. The last large epidemic there had occurred in the year 1801, and\r\nhad carried away 1,626 out of 176,700 inhabitants. In the year 1864\r\nanother rather mild epidemic had broken out, but had quickly\r\ndisappeared. In the year 1870 the number of small-pox patients in Berlin\r\nwas small; an average of nine persons per month succumbed to the disease\r\nbetween the first part of August and the last part of November. In the\r\nmonth of December 1870 the death-rate began to increase, at first rather\r\nslowly; the number of deaths in that month was 22, and in March 1872 it\r\nwas 176. The epidemic now began to spread rapidly, and in June it\r\nreached its climax with 648 deaths; during the summer it abated a\r\nlittle, but in the fall it began to rage more and more furiously until\r\nDecember, when it reached a second climax with 671 deaths. The progress\r\nof the epidemic is shown by the following table, taken from Guttstadt’s\r\nexcellent book. The number of deaths caused by small-pox in Berlin was:\r\n\r\n                          November (1870)   9\r\n                          December         22\r\n                          January (1871)   48\r\n                          February         80\r\n                          March           176\r\n                          April           349\r\n                          May             430\r\n                          June            648\r\n                          July            532\r\n                          August          528\r\n                          September       490\r\n                          October         600\r\n                          November        660\r\n                          December        671\r\n                          January (1872)  445\r\n                          February        256\r\n                          March           151\r\n                          April           117\r\n                          May              76\r\n                          June             33\r\n                          July             18\r\n                          August           10\r\n\r\nThe disease was unusually severe and virulent; fifteen per cent of the\r\npatients died in the hospitals. The total number of deaths[270] in the\r\nyear 1871, when the population of the city was 826,341, was 5,212, or\r\n63·1 per 10,000 inhabitants; thus the total mortality, which in the\r\nyears 1867–70 had been 31·8 per cent (including the still-births),\r\nreached the prodigious height of 40·4 per cent. The cause of the wide\r\ndissemination of small-pox in Berlin was the fact that large numbers of\r\npeople, including children, had never been vaccinated, and only a few\r\nhad ever been revaccinated. According to a rough estimate made by\r\nGuttstadt, of Berlin’s total population in the year 1871 some 20,000\r\npeople had never been vaccinated, 530,000 had been vaccinated only once,\r\nand only 270,000 had been revaccinated; fourteen per cent of those who\r\nhad never been vaccinated, two per cent of those who had been vaccinated\r\nonce, and O·5 per cent of those who had been revaccinated, contracted\r\nthe disease. In the garrison, which averaged 9,110 men, only 57 cases of\r\nthe disease and 4 deaths were reported between July 1, 1870, and June\r\n30, 1871. But few prisoners were taken to Berlin; only 24 prisoners\r\nsuffering from small-pox were committed to the lazarets, and of these\r\nonly 4 died; the first two cases were in August and September.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Potsdam only those districts which\r\nbordered directly on Berlin were severely attacked by small-pox in the\r\nyear 1871, e.g. the districts of Niederbarnim, Teltow, Jüterbog,\r\nLuckenwalde, and East and West Havelland; in the following years those\r\ndistricts bordering on Niederbarnim (as Oberbarnim, Angermünde, and\r\nTemplin) also suffered severely. In the city of Potsdam two Frenchmen\r\ncontracted the disease on February 6, shortly after their arrival there,\r\nand on February 19 a soldier who had accompanied them was taken sick. In\r\nApril an epidemic of rather wide extent was raging in the city; the\r\nnumber of deaths caused by small-pox in April 1871 was 157 (34·5 per\r\n10,000 inhabitants), and in April 1872 it was 71 (16·2 per 10,000). In\r\nthe city of Brandenburg-on-the-Havel an infected French soldier arrived\r\nin February 1871; he communicated the disease to his attendant, and in\r\nthat very month cases of small-pox were reported among the civil\r\ninhabitants of the city, although it was impossible to prove a connexion\r\nbetween them and that of the French soldier. The number of deaths, all\r\ntold, was 59. The number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the\r\nGovernmental District of Potsdam was:\r\n\r\n                                         1871. 1872.\r\n                    Prenzlau               7·5  11·1\r\n                    Templin               17·5  28·4\r\n                    Angermünde            15·0  53·4\r\n                    Oberbarnim            18·2  33·8\r\n                    Niederbarnim          36·5  27·1\r\n                    Teltow                46·4  40·4\r\n                    Beeskow-Storkow       20·6  39·8\r\n                    Jüterbog-Luckenwalde  43·4  38·7\r\n                    Zauch-Belzig          14·6  38·1\r\n                    East Havelland        37·7  14·7\r\n                    West Havelland        32·3  33·4\r\n                    Ruppin                26·8  13·3\r\n                    East Priegnitz        14·9  12·6\r\n                    West Priegnitz        16·8  23·3\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Frankfurt small-pox raged only to a\r\nmoderate extent in the year 1871. In Frankfurt-on-the-Oder itself there\r\nwere sporadic outbreaks of the disease every year. On November 12 two\r\ninfected prisoners from Metz were committed to the hospital, and before\r\nthe end of that month two attendants contracted the disease; a few cases\r\nalso occurred in the garrison in the month of November. Of the French\r\nprisoners, whose maximum number was 756, eight contracted the disease\r\nand two succumbed to it; in the garrison, which averaged 1,881 men,\r\nthere were 21 cases of the disease and no deaths. Among the civil\r\ninhabitants, on the other hand, a somewhat more severe epidemic raged;\r\nwhereas in the year 1870 only 21 cases of the disease were reported, in\r\nthe year 1871 there were 19 cases in the month of January alone; until\r\nMay some 196 persons contracted the disease, which after that began to\r\nabate. The number of deaths, all told, in the year 1871 was 117, and in\r\n1872 it was 70. In Landsberg-on-the-Warthe small-pox broke out in the\r\nmiddle of November in consequence of the arrival of an infected\r\nprisoner; the first case among the civil inhabitants was reported on\r\nNovember 20. The total number of deaths in the year 1871 was 97. At\r\nKottbus an infected French prisoner arrived on October 1, resulting in a\r\nrather severe epidemic among the civil inhabitants (114 deaths in the\r\nyear 1871). Not until the year 1872 did the disease become very\r\nwidespread in the Governmental District of Frankfurt; with the exception\r\nof the city of Frankfurt there was no district which suffered more\r\nseverely in the year 1871 than in 1872. In most of the districts\r\nsmall-pox broke out very virulently, the only exceptions being the\r\ndistricts of Lübben and Spremberg.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dissemination of small-pox in the Province of Saxony\r\nGuttstadt gives us very detailed information. In the years 1871–2 the\r\ndisease was equally prevalent in all three governmental districts in the\r\nProvince. In the city of Magdeburg the last case was reported on May 24,\r\n1870, and from then until November there was not a single case among the\r\ncivil inhabitants. The first prisoners arrived at Magdeburg in the\r\nlatter part of August, and on September 14 a case of small-pox was\r\nobserved among them; this was followed by ten more cases in that month.\r\nOf the prisoners brought to Magdeburg, the maximum number of whom was no\r\nless than 25,450, some 1,092 contracted the disease, and of these 271\r\ndied. The largest number of cases was reported in the month of February\r\n1871. Of the garrison, which averaged 11,296 men, there were only 84\r\ncases of the disease (7·4 per cent), and of these 8 died. The first case\r\namong the civil inhabitants was reported on November 18, 1870, and this\r\nwas followed by seven more cases in that month, occurring in various\r\nparts of the city. The number of deaths in the year 1871 was 646 (56·4\r\nper 10,000 inhabitants), and in the year 1872 only 45 deaths were\r\nreported. From the city of Magdeburg small-pox spread to the surrounding\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nOn November 25 a transport of prisoners from Metz, after having been\r\ndetained for two or three weeks in the badly infected city of Minden,\r\narrived at Quedlinburg; two days later the first case of small-pox\r\noccurred among them. A second transport, which arrived on January 31,\r\n1871, likewise brought infected men with it. Among the civil inhabitants\r\nsmall-pox did not become very widespread, and only three civilians\r\nsuccumbed to the disease in the year 1871. In Aschersleben small-pox\r\nbroke out among the prisoners in January 1871, a few days after their\r\narrival from Mayence, and the number of cases reported in the months of\r\nJanuary and February was only twelve. According to Guttstadt, small-pox\r\nwas already prevalent in the civil population in December, when the\r\ndisease was given an opportunity to spread to the surrounding country.\r\nAccording to the German Health Report, on the other hand, small-pox did\r\nnot appear in the city until February, when the proprietor of an inn,\r\nwhich had been converted into a small-pox hospital, contracted it. The\r\ntotal number of deaths in the year 1871 amounted to 53 (31·6 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants). On January 26 and 27, 1871, some 360 prisoners, four of\r\nthem infected with small-pox, arrived at Halberstadt, having come from\r\nMayence. The number of deaths in the city of Halberstadt in the year\r\n1871 was 29 (11·4 per 10,000 inhabitants). Only those districts in the\r\nGovernmental District of Magdeburg which bordered on the city of\r\nMagdeburg were more severely attacked; Kalbe (43·1 deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants), Wanzleben (37·7), and Wollmirstedt (29·2). In addition to\r\nthese the district of Wernigerode also had a very high small-pox\r\nmortality in the year 1871 (70·5 per 10,000). In those districts further\r\naway from Magdeburg—Osterburg, Salzwedel, Aschersleben, and\r\nHalberstadt—the climax of the small-pox mortality was not reached until\r\nthe year 1872, whereas in the other districts it was reached in 1871.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Merseburg small-pox broke out very\r\nseverely in the stronghold of Torgau, where in the last part of\r\nSeptember and in the first part of December prisoners arrived from\r\nStrassburg and Metz, respectively; in both transports, but especially in\r\nthe second, there were infected men. The first cases of the disease were\r\nreported on October 4. Of the prisoners, the maximum number of whom was\r\n9,359, some 603 (64·4 per 1,000) contracted the disease and 128 (21·2\r\nper cent of those who contracted it) died. The epidemic, accordingly,\r\nwas unusually severe among the prisoners, and it reached its climax in\r\nJanuary. In the German garrison, which averaged 3,943 men, there were,\r\nall told, 75 cases of the disease (19·0 per 1,000) and five deaths.\r\nAmong the civil inhabitants the first persons to contract the disease in\r\nthe last part of November and first part of December were a woman, who\r\nwas employed as a laundress in the garrison lazaret, her sons, and a\r\nwoman who had visited the place where the prisoners were confined. The\r\nepidemic did not break out until December 22, on which day a single case\r\nwas reported; on the following day twelve more cases were reported. The\r\ntotal number of deaths was 67 (61·7 per 10,000). Very soon the infection\r\nspread throughout the entire vicinity of Torgau, which in the year 1871\r\nhad a very high small-pox mortality; by 1872 the disease had almost\r\ndisappeared from the city.\r\n\r\nIn Wittenberg, which before the arrival of the prisoners was absolutely\r\nfree from small-pox, a transport arrived on August 27, and on September\r\n5 the first small-pox patients were taken to the lazaret. Among the\r\nFrenchmen the disease did not rage very extensively; of a maximum number\r\nof 9,753, only fifty-one (5·2 per cent) contracted the disease and ten\r\nsuccumbed to it. Of the garrison, which averaged 2,845 men, seventeen\r\ncontracted the disease and two died. Among the civil inhabitants the\r\nfirst case of small-pox was reported on October 3; it was that of a\r\npastor who had been serving as curate among the prisoners. This case was\r\nfollowed by several others, most of the victims being persons who lived\r\nin the vicinity of the pastor’s dwelling-place. The pestilence then\r\nbegan to spread rapidly among the civil inhabitants, finally developing\r\ninto a severe epidemic. There were 768 cases reported, distributed as\r\nindicated by the following table:\r\n\r\n                           October (1870)  26\r\n                           November        66\r\n                           December       102\r\n                           January (1871) 107\r\n                           February        97\r\n                           March          113\r\n                           April           76\r\n                           May             83\r\n                           June            61\r\n                           July            27\r\n                           August           8\r\n                           September        1\r\n\r\nOf those who contracted the disease five died in the year 1870 and 100\r\ndied in the following year (86·5 per 10,000 inhabitants). Likewise in\r\nthe country surrounding Wittenberg small-pox was very widespread in the\r\nyear 1871.\r\n\r\nAmong the French prisoners in Halle-on-the-Saale there were twenty-eight\r\ncases of small-pox in January and February, and at the same time a few\r\ncases of the disease were reported in the regiment that was transferred\r\nfrom Halle to Mülhausen. In the first part of March 1871, cases were\r\nreported among the civil inhabitants, and they constituted the beginning\r\nof a large epidemic. In the year 1871 there were 195 deaths due to the\r\ndisease (37·0 per 10,000 inhabitants) and in the year 1872 there were\r\nforty-one more deaths.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, small-pox was rather uniformly spread throughout the\r\nGovernmental District of Merseburg in the year 1871; the districts of\r\nTorgau and Wittenberg were the only ones that were attacked with\r\nparticular severity. In the western part of the governmental district\r\nsmall-pox raged more furiously in 1872 than in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe city of Erfurt (Governmental District of Erfurt) in the year 1869\r\nhad been the scene of a small-pox epidemic, which lasted well into the\r\nfollowing year. The last cases of the disease occurring in connexion\r\nwith this epidemic were reported on August 13, 1870. To be sure, the\r\ndisease revealed its presence on September 27 and 30 among the French\r\nprisoners, who had arrived on August 21, and these cases were followed\r\nby many more when a new transport of prisoners arrived from Metz; but of\r\nall the prisoners in Erfurt, the maximum number of whom was no less than\r\n12,400, only 203 men (16·4 per cent), all told, contracted the disease,\r\nand of these only 28 died. In the garrison, which averaged 4,627 men,\r\nthere were 25 cases of small-pox and no deaths. On the other hand, in\r\nDecember there began among the civil inhabitants an epidemic which\r\nspread rapidly and reached its climax in April 1871, with 244 cases.\r\nAccording to Guttstadt, the number of deaths due to small-pox was 253\r\n(53·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871, and 33 in the year 1872.\r\nThe epidemic did not come to an end until June 1872.[271] In Mülhausen,\r\nprisoners from Mayence, where small-pox was prevalent, arrived in the\r\nfirst part of December, and some of them were already infected with the\r\ndisease. On February 1 the pestilence spread to the civil population,\r\nand carried away twenty-five persons in the course of the entire year.\r\nNordhausen was free from small-pox in the summer of 1870; but the\r\ndisease was twice borne into the city, in October 1870 and in January\r\n1871, by prisoners. The first cases among the civil inhabitants were\r\nreported in the latter month, after which they increased rapidly in\r\nnumber. In the year 1870 there were 233 deaths (109·5 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants) due to the pestilence. Except in these two cities of Erfurt\r\nand Nordhausen the disease did not become very widespread in the year\r\n1871 in any part of the Governmental District of Erfurt.\r\n\r\nRegarding the appearance of small-pox in Brunswick, the Thuringian\r\nStates, and Anhalt, only a small amount of information is available. In\r\nthe city of Brunswick a German soldier, who had come from Carignan,\r\ncontracted the disease in September, and in November and January six\r\nFrenchmen were taken sick; two of the latter died. In the garrison,\r\nwhich averaged 1,389 men, there were four cases of small-pox in March\r\nand June. According to a manuscript report of the Brunswick Bureau of\r\nStatistics, the number of deaths due to small-pox throughout the entire\r\nDuchy was 2 in the year 1870, 269 in the year 1871, and 215 in the year\r\n1872. At Gotha a French prisoner suffering from small-pox was left\r\nbehind in January, and another prisoner in the same transport contracted\r\nthe disease a few days later; in February there were a few isolated\r\ncases in the garrison. At Weimar a German field-soldier suffering from\r\nsmall-pox arrived in February; he infected the woman who took care of\r\nhim, and presently the disease broke out in the city. In Altenburg two\r\ninfected sub-officers of the field-army and two Frenchmen, likewise\r\nsuffering from the disease, were committed to the reserve-lazaret, and\r\nshortly afterwards a small epidemic broke out in the garrison. There\r\nwere ten cases of the disease and no deaths among the Frenchmen, and in\r\nthe garrison, which averaged 1,178 men, there were eleven cases and one\r\ndeath. Among the civil inhabitants the first to be attacked were a\r\nsick-attendant and a journeyman mason; the latter had removed the soot\r\nfrom a stove in a room occupied by small-pox patients.\r\n\r\nIn the Duchy of Saxe-Meiningen, according to a manuscript report of the\r\nlocal Bureau of Statistics, the number of deaths due to small-pox in the\r\nyears 1860–71 was 133, in the year 1872 it was 37, and in the year 1873\r\nit was 47. The figures for the several years before 1871 are not\r\navailable. Every transport of sick soldiers from France brought\r\nsmall-pox patients to the city of Meiningen; five cases, the first in\r\nJanuary, were reported in the garrison, which consisted of 1,663 men,\r\nand in the same month there were cases among the civil inhabitants. It\r\nwas impossible, however, to establish a connexion between those in the\r\ngarrison and those in the city.\r\n\r\nIn Dessau, one French prisoner in October and two in November contracted\r\nthe disease, which in January appeared throughout the city and became\r\nepidemic. In the garrison, which consisted of 1,228 men, there were ten\r\ncases of the disease, none of which terminated fatally.\r\n\r\nHamburg,[272] after the by no means mild epidemic that raged there in\r\nthe year 1864 (19·7 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants) suffered very little\r\nfrom the disease in the following years; in 1868 there were five deaths\r\nreported, and in 1869 the number increased to twenty. After the\r\nFranco-German War an epidemic of small-pox raged in Hamburg, which was\r\nmore extensive and more furious than almost any other epidemic that\r\nGermany had ever experienced. In the years 1870–2 no less than 4,053\r\npersons succumbed to small-pox in Hamburg. Among the French prisoners\r\nthere were twenty-two cases of the disease and one death, and among the\r\nGerman troops there were twelve cases and no deaths. The disease first\r\nmade its appearance in the summer of 1870, when there were a few cases\r\nin the city; but in October they began to increase in number, and by the\r\nfirst of the year the disease was spreading rapidly. The number of\r\ndeaths in Hamburg was:\r\n\r\n                                       1870. 1871. 1872.\r\n                January                         69   158\r\n                February                       107    74\r\n                March                          163    47\r\n                April                          226    16\r\n                May                            364    17\r\n                June                       2   503     4\r\n                July                       2   554     2\r\n                August                     6   578     2\r\n                September                  5   373     1\r\n                October                   10   311     1\r\n                November                  24   229\r\n                December                  34   170     1\r\n                                         ——— —————   ———\r\n                Entire year               83 3,647   323\r\n                Per 10,000 inhabitants   3·6 154·4   9·5\r\n\r\nThe figures for 1870 and 1871 include the city and suburbs, and those\r\nfor 1872 the entire State—a fact, however, which makes but little\r\ndifference. This severe epidemic gave rise to the passing of a law on\r\nJanuary 30, 1872, rendering vaccination compulsory; the enforcement of\r\nthis law was greatly facilitated in the following years by the fact that\r\neverybody very soon came to recognize the superiority of animal lymph.\r\n\r\nIn Schleswig-Holstein the city of Altona, which bordered on Hamburg, was\r\nvery severely attacked by small-pox. No detailed information regarding\r\nthe epidemic there is available; the population of the city in the year\r\n1871 was 83,177, and in the same year 965 persons (116·0 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants) succumbed to small-pox; in the following year there were\r\nonly two deaths. In the year 1871 only three districts were more\r\nseverely attacked by the disease than Altona—Rendsburg, Steinburg, and\r\nStollmarn. The city of Rendsburg was an important seat of the disease,\r\nwhich broke out there on November 16 among the prisoners, shortly after\r\ntheir arrival; the epidemic, however, was rather mild, since of 2,590\r\nprisoners only forty-four contracted the disease and only three died.\r\nThe garrison, which averaged 2,876 men, was somewhat more severely\r\nattacked; 109 men contracted the disease (37·9 per 1,000), and four\r\nsuccumbed to it. The epidemic became unusually widespread in the city;\r\n114 inhabitants (98·8 per 10,000) succumbed to small-pox there in the\r\nyear 1871.\r\n\r\nOf 5,000 prisoners confined in Lockstedt, 47 contracted small-pox, the\r\nfirst in October, and the rest in February; only a few men in the German\r\ngarrison were attacked by the disease. From Lockstedt the disease spread\r\nto the surrounding country, including Itzehoe, where it caused 102\r\ndeaths (110·6 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871. From there\r\nsmall-pox spread in all directions; it was conveyed to Stollmarn chiefly\r\nby working-men from Hamburg and Altona who lived in the country.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Lübeck, the population of which in the year 1871 was\r\n52,158, the following number of people, according to the report of the\r\nlocal Bureau of Statistics, contracted and succumbed to small-pox:\r\n\r\n                            _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                       1870          24         1\r\n                       1871         315        36\r\n                       1872          99        15\r\n\r\nJudging from this table, the city was not very severely attacked by the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIn the province of Hanover, small-pox did not become very widespread in\r\nthe years 1871 and 1872, thanks to the introduction of compulsory\r\nvaccination; this is evident from one of the tables reproduced above. In\r\nthe year 1871 the districts of Osterode and Harburg had the highest\r\nfigures, 32·4 and 18·7 deaths respectively per 10,000 inhabitants, and\r\nin the following year Osterode had 47·4 and Einbeck was second with\r\n24·6. In the city of Hanover the cases of the disease in the garrison\r\nwere few and far between; the first cases among the prisoners were\r\nreported in August; their maximum number was 2,299, and fifty-six of\r\nthem contracted the disease and three died. In the city seventy-one\r\npersons succumbed to the disease in the year 1871, and eighty-nine\r\npersons in the year 1872 (8·1 and 10·2, respectively, per 10,000\r\ninhabitants). In Hildesheim, cases of the disease, which had been\r\nbrought there from France, were reported in March 1871; seven soldiers\r\nin the garrison were taken sick. In Göttingen (Governmental District of\r\nHildesheim) persons who had contracted the disease in France were taken\r\nto the lazaret in March 1871; whether or not this was responsible for\r\nthe communication of the disease to the civil inhabitants, among whom a\r\nsevere epidemic had never before raged, cannot be ascertained. At\r\nEinbeck (Governmental District of Hildesheim) several small-pox\r\nconvalescents belonging to the field-army arrived in February 1871. In\r\nOsnabrück a soldier belonging to the field-army contracted the disease\r\nin December. In Papenburg (Governmental District of Osnabrück) the dépôt\r\nwhere the prisoners were confined was very severely attacked; of 993\r\nprisoners, sixty-three contracted the disease and two died. In Lingen\r\n(Governmental District of Osnabrück) there was a rather large number of\r\nFrenchmen suffering from small-pox—fifty-three, all told, of whom three\r\ndied. In Stade thirty-two out of 2,284 prisoners contracted the disease\r\nin January and February, and five of them died.\r\n\r\nIn Bremen the epidemic of small-pox did not become very widespread.\r\nAccording to a report issued by the local Bureau of Statistics, there\r\nwere only twenty-six cases of the disease there in the year 1870 and no\r\ndeaths; in the following years the number of deaths was as follows:[273]\r\n\r\n                       _Bremen—City._ _Rest of State._\r\n                  1871             45                9\r\n                  1872             20               21\r\n                  1873              3\r\n\r\nIn the case of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg the number of deaths due to\r\nsmall-pox is unknown. In the city of Oldenburg three French prisoners\r\n(two in October and one in November) contracted small-pox, and one case\r\nof the disease was reported in the garrison in March. Regarding the\r\nappearance of small-pox among the civil inhabitants no information is\r\navailable.\r\n\r\nThe governmental districts of Münster and Minden (Province of\r\nWestphalia) were only moderately afflicted by small-pox in the years\r\n1870–2. According to Guttstadt, a few cases of the disease were reported\r\nin the city of Münster in May 1869, and these were followed by seven\r\nmore in July 1870. After that no cases were reported until November 9,\r\n1870, when a pastor, who had been ministering to the prisoners in\r\nLingen, contracted the disease; another pastor fared in the same way.\r\nThese were followed by eight more cases in two buildings in Münster\r\nitself, and another two in the community of Überwasser, which bordered\r\non the city of Münster. In the latter part of the year 1870 no cases\r\nwere reported in the garrison. In the latter part of January 1871 some\r\n3,000 prisoners were brought from Wesel, which was badly infected with\r\nthe disease, to Münster, and there four of them were immediately taken\r\nsick. This was the beginning of a rather extensive epidemic among the\r\nprisoners, 143 of whom contracted the disease and thirteen died; the\r\nmaximum number of cases (107) was reported in February. In the garrison,\r\nwhich numbered 3,910 men, a small number of cases was reported from\r\nFebruary on; of twenty-one cases reported, one resulted fatally. In the\r\nsame month a small epidemic raged among the civil inhabitants, reaching\r\nits climax in May. The following table indicates the number of people\r\nwho contracted the disease:\r\n\r\n                           November (1870)  2\r\n                           December         8\r\n                           January (1871)   0\r\n                           February        13\r\n                           March           30\r\n                           April           48\r\n                           May             91\r\n                           June            84\r\n                           July            43\r\n                           August           9\r\n                           September        5\r\n                           October          1\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths in the year 1871 was sixty-seven (26·9 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants), and in the year 1872 it was twenty-two; most of the cases\r\noccurred in the quarters of the city known as Jüdefeld and Lamberti, on\r\naccount of the proximity of the prison along the Buddenturm. In the\r\nsurrounding communities the epidemic reached its climax in July, and\r\nafter that began to abate rapidly. The only other region in the\r\nGovernmental District of Münster in which small-pox made its appearance\r\nwas Recklinghausen, which borders on the Rhenish-Westphalian\r\ncoal-fields, whence the infection doubtless came; in Recklinghausen\r\nthere were 28·8 deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the year 1871, and 46·4\r\nper 10,000 in the year 1872.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Minden only the city and vicinity of\r\nMinden were severely attacked; before the war began they were free from\r\nsmall-pox. On September 10 the first prisoners arrived, and among them\r\ncases of small-pox had already been observed in the first part of that\r\nmonth; in the course of the next eight days more cases were reported,\r\nand of a total number of 5,071 prisoners 98 contracted the disease and\r\n13 succumbed to it. In the garrison, which numbered 5,071 men, one case\r\nwas reported in October, four in December, and fifty-two in the\r\nfollowing months; only two cases terminated fatally. The first case\r\namong the civil inhabitants was reported on November 5; the victim was a\r\nlaundress who had done washing for the prisoners. This constituted the\r\nbeginning of an epidemic in which 651 persons contracted the disease and\r\n114 succumbed to it; the population of the city was 16,862. The epidemic\r\nspread to the surrounding localities, presumably because the woollen\r\nblankets which the patients had used were sold there. Throughout the\r\nentire district of Minden 391 persons (51·0 per 10,000 inhabitants)\r\nsuccumbed to small-pox in the year 1871, whereas in the following year\r\nonly 34 deaths were reported, all told.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Arnsberg the districts of Dortmund and\r\nBochum, which belonged to the Rhenish-Westphalian coal region, and were\r\neven at that time densely populated, were severely attacked by\r\nsmall-pox; the districts of Hamm and Hagen, which bordered on the\r\nlatter, were likewise very hard hit. The following table indicates the\r\nnumber of persons per 10,000 inhabitants that succumbed to small-pox in\r\nthe districts mentioned:\r\n\r\n                                     1871. 1872.\r\n                        Arnsberg      12·7  11·4\r\n                        Meschede       6·5   4·3\r\n                        Brilon        10·0  23·1\r\n                        Lippstadt      2·9   9·8\r\n                        Soest          9·6  26·0\r\n                        Hamm          38·1  30·0\r\n                        Dortmund      55·3  38·4\r\n                        Bochum       123·1  71·8\r\n                        Hagen         13·7  54·2\r\n                        Iserlohn       4·3  16·7\r\n                        Altena        18·5  12·7\r\n                        Olpe          18·8   9·4\r\n                        Siegen         9·2   7·4\r\n                        Wittgenstein  10·1  11·6\r\n\r\nIn the city of Bochum alone 698 persons (329·0 per 10,000 inhabitants)\r\nsuccumbed to small-pox in the year 1871; almost one-half of the deaths\r\nthat year were caused by small-pox. The city of Dortmund itself was less\r\nseverely attacked in the year 1871 than the country surrounding it; in\r\nthe city alone 96 persons (21·5 per 10,000) died of the disease, whereas\r\nin the district of Dortmund, excluding the city, there were 661 deaths\r\n(71·4 per 10,000). The near-by city of Hamm was very severely attacked;\r\n114 persons (67·3 per 10,000) succumbed there in the year 1871, whereas\r\nthe total number of deaths in the rest of the district amounted to 113\r\n(26·5 per 10,000). According to Guttstadt, a prisoner contracted the\r\ndisease there on November 2 and subsequently died. The first cases among\r\nthe civil inhabitants were reported on November 22; the victims were an\r\noccupant of a public-house situated near the lazaret, and a Catholic\r\npriest who had visited the patients.\r\n\r\nIn the Rhine Province the districts of the Rhenish-Westphalian\r\nindustrial centre belonging to the Governmental District of Düsseldorf\r\nalso suffered severely from small-pox: e.g. the districts of Crefeld,\r\nDuisburg, Düsseldorf, Essen, Mettmann, Elberfeld, and Barmen; later on,\r\nin the year 1872, the districts of Lennep and Solingen were also\r\nseverely attacked. The districts in the Governmental District of\r\nDüsseldorf lying on the left side of the Rhine were all, with the\r\nexception of Crefeld, mildly attacked. The following table indicates the\r\nnumber of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the various districts\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\nThe districts on the left side of the Rhine:\r\n\r\n                                     1871. 1872.\r\n                        Cleve          4·8   1·5\r\n                        Geldern        7·8   0·8\r\n                        Mörs           8·4   8·8\r\n                        Kempen         7·3  13·3\r\n                        Gladbach       1·6   5·5\r\n                        Grevenbroich   1·8   2·3\r\n                        Neuss          9·3   4·3\r\n                        Crefeld       54·7  33·7\r\n\r\nThe districts on the right side of the Rhine:\r\n\r\n                                       1871. 1872.\r\n                      Rees              23·5   4·6\r\n                      Duisburg         100·7  10·2\r\n                      Essen             52·9  37·0\r\n                      Düsseldorf        56·2   3·5\r\n                      Elberfeld (city)  47·5  44·0\r\n                      Barmen            24·8  49·1\r\n                      Mettmann          31·3  36·7\r\n                      Lennep             3·3  31·4\r\n                      Solingen           5·1  36·3\r\n\r\nOn August 17 and 18, seven infected Frenchmen arrived at the city of\r\nDüsseldorf and were at once isolated in a house outside the city limits;\r\nin November a few more infected prisoners arrived. In the small German\r\ngarrison (523 men) no cases were observed until later (April and May).\r\nIn December 1870, 20 cases among the civil inhabitants were reported;\r\nthey constituted the beginning of an epidemic which developed rapidly,\r\nreached its climax in July with 648 cases, and then quickly disappeared.\r\nIn the following year, 524 small-pox patients (75·0 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants) died in the city of Düsseldorf.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Duisburg eleven cases of small-pox were reported in\r\nDecember 1870, and here again the epidemic developed rapidly, reaching\r\nits climax (1,549 cases) in May 1871. The city of Duisburg was most\r\nseverely attacked; 529 persons (173·2 per 10,000 inhabitants) died there\r\nof small-pox in the year 1871.\r\n\r\nIn the stronghold of Wesel (district of Rees), where the prisoners were\r\nconfined in the stronghold itself on Buderich Island and Spellmer Heath,\r\npersons suffering from small-pox arrived in August and September; and\r\nstill more arrived in November with a transport of prisoners from Metz.\r\nOf the 16,299 prisoners, 1,042 (63·9 per 1,000) contracted small-pox,\r\nand 127 (12·2 per cent of those taken sick) died; the largest number of\r\ncases was reported in January. In the garrison, which numbered 7,284\r\nmen, there were 117 cases of the disease and seven deaths. Since the\r\ninhabitants of the city of Wesel and of the surrounding country had\r\ncontinual intercourse with the prisoners, the dissemination of the\r\ndisease was inevitable; the epidemic among the civil inhabitants began\r\nin November and carried away nine persons in 1870 and eighty-four\r\npersons in 1871.\r\n\r\nIn Elberfeld the epidemic did not become very widespread until December\r\n1871. The first fatal case in the city of Essen was reported in January\r\n1871; the epidemic then increased in fury until June 1871 (48 deaths),\r\nwhen it began to abate. In the following year it revived a little in\r\nMay, when 26 cases were reported. All told, 272 persons (53·0 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants) died of small-pox in Essen in the year 1871, and 112\r\npersons (21·0 per 10,000) in the year 1872.[274]\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Cologne small-pox became more or less\r\nwidespread in the years 1871–2 in the city and immediate vicinity of\r\nCologne; in the few years preceding the war Cologne had had numerous\r\ncases of the disease, and in the year 1866 a small epidemic (223 cases)\r\nhad occurred there; in the year 1869 some forty cases were officially\r\nreported. According to Guttstadt, the first transport of prisoners,\r\namong them a small-pox patient, passed through Cologne early in\r\nSeptember. Of the gradually increasing number of prisoners (the maximum\r\nnumber, including Deutz, was 13,774) 175, all told, contracted the\r\ndisease and twenty-four succumbed to it. In the garrison, which numbered\r\n9,207 men, there were only nineteen cases of the disease and one death.\r\nAmong the civil inhabitants an epidemic broke out as early as September\r\n12; it reached its climax in April 1871, abated somewhat during the\r\nsummer, and in October and November started up again. The following\r\ntable indicates the number of people that contracted and succumbed to\r\nthe disease in the months mentioned (the population of the city at that\r\ntime was 129,000):\r\n\r\n                                  _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                 September (1870)          24         3\r\n                 October                   65        18\r\n                 November                  80        15\r\n                 December                  97        27\r\n                 January (1871)           194        53\r\n                 February                 336        79\r\n                 March                    434        87\r\n                 April                    510        71\r\n                 May                      318        50\r\n                 June                     159        34\r\n                 July                      75        13\r\n                 August                    35        10\r\n                 September                 16         3\r\n                 October                   66         5\r\n                 November                  34         9\r\n                 December                   7         2\r\n\r\nAccording to this table, 63 persons (4·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) died in\r\nthe months September-December 1870, and 416 persons (32·2 per 10,000)\r\ndied in the year 1871; in the following year 25 more deaths (1·9 per\r\n10,000) were reported. In the district of Cologne (excluding the city)\r\n212 persons (24·3 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed to small-pox in the\r\nyear 1871; in all the other districts the number of deaths caused by the\r\ndisease was small.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Coblenz the city of Coblenz and the\r\nadjacent districts of Neuwied and Mayen, as well as the district of\r\nKreuznach, which lay in the extreme south and very near the scene of the\r\nwar, were most severely attacked in the year 1871. In the stronghold of\r\nCoblenz, according to Guttstadt, a locksmith contracted the disease in\r\nthe latter part of August; he had become infected while sitting beside\r\nthe body of his brother, who had succumbed to the disease in Casbach, a\r\nvillage near Lingen, in Hanover. The first prisoners arrived in Coblenz\r\non September 15, and on September 23 one of them was found to be\r\nsuffering from small-pox and was taken to the lazaret; new transports of\r\nprisoners kept bringing more cases of the disease. Of the 15,011 French\r\nprisoners that arrived there, a large number contracted the disease; the\r\nmaximum number was in January, when 571 (38·0 per 1,000) were taken\r\nsick, and 111 died (19·4 per cent of the patients). In the garrison,\r\nwhich consisted of 8,710 men, there were 83 cases of the disease and\r\nfour deaths in the month of November. Among the civil inhabitants of\r\nCoblenz 81 persons (24·2 per 10,000) died of small-pox in the year 1871;\r\nin the rest of the district of Coblenz 277 persons (67·1 per 10,000)\r\ndied; in the district of Mayen there were 234 deaths (43·9 per 10,000),\r\nin the district of Neuwied 220 deaths (32·3), and in the district of\r\nKreuznach 129 deaths (21·2). In the year 1872 the epidemic was not at\r\nall widespread in any of the districts.\r\n\r\nIn the Governmental District of Aix-la-Chapelle only the district of\r\nMalmedy suffered severely in the year 1871; being in the south-western\r\npart of the governmental district it was, like the border districts in\r\nthe Governmental District of Trèves mentioned below, exposed to the\r\nfirst onrush of the transports of prisoners. The number of deaths there\r\nin the year 1871 was 333 (111·0 per 10,000), whereas in the following\r\nyear not a single death due to small-pox was reported in the district.\r\nAt Jülich a Frenchman suffering from small-pox arrived in July, and in\r\nNovember an epidemic broke out among the prisoners; 188 cases of\r\nsmall-pox were reported, and of these only three terminated fatally. In\r\nthe garrison only one man contracted the disease.\r\n\r\nThe governmental district of Trèves had a very large number of small-pox\r\ncases in the year 1871, since a large part of it bordered directly on\r\nthe enemy’s country, so that large numbers of sick and convalescent\r\nprisoners passed through it. In the year 1872 only a few cases of\r\nsmall-pox were reported, except in the immediate vicinity of Trèves,\r\nwhere the pestilence became quite widespread. The following table\r\nindicates the number of deaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the districts\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\n                                       1871. 1872.\r\n                     Daun                3·0   1·9\r\n                     Wittlich           18·7   1·3\r\n                     Bernkastel          6·1   0·5\r\n                     St. Wendel         20·0\r\n                     Ottweiler          36·2   0·4\r\n                     Trèves (city)      12·6   4·1\r\n                     Trèves (district)  17·2  20·6\r\n                     Prüm               33·2   0·9\r\n                     Bitburg            23·6   1·4\r\n                     Saarburg           60·9   1·0\r\n                     Merzig             51·5   2·8\r\n                     Saarlouis          80·0   0·2\r\n                     Saarbrücken        49·5   0·3\r\n\r\nThe province of Hesse-Nassau suffered very little from small-pox in the\r\nyears 1871–2, since a compulsory vaccination law had long been in force\r\nthere. Large epidemics did not occur anywhere. In Cassel a case of\r\nsmall-pox had occurred in the summer of 1870, and after that there were\r\nno more cases until November 9; on that day a man was taken sick who had\r\nbeen acting as a sutler among the German troops before Paris and had\r\nthere been infected. On November 18 a nurse employed in a house in which\r\na field-soldier was quartered contracted the disease, and this case was\r\nfollowed by six more cases among the civil inhabitants; all told, six\r\npersons succumbed to small-pox in the city of Cassel in the year 1870,\r\nninety-nine persons (21·4 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871, and\r\nfour persons in the year 1872.\r\n\r\nIn Frankfurt-on-the-Main a few cases of small-pox were reported in the\r\ncourse of the year 1870; the disease was perhaps conveyed thither from\r\nStuttgart. After the commencement of the war it was borne into the city\r\nby numerous transports of soldiers and prisoners, and a widespread\r\nepidemic soon developed. In the garrison thirty-two cases of the disease\r\nwere reported. After the Rochus Hospital was opened to small-pox\r\npatients, in April, the epidemic reached its climax; the following\r\ntable, found in the German Health Report, indicates the number of\r\npatients received into the above-mentioned hospital and the number that\r\ndied there:\r\n\r\n                          _No. patients._ _No. deaths._\r\n                 January               81            13\r\n                 February             148            16\r\n                 March                168            17\r\n                 April                177            25\r\n                 May\r\n                 June                  36            12\r\n\r\nIn August the epidemic came to an end. All told, there were 23 deaths\r\ndue to small-pox in Frankfurt-on-the-Main in 1870, 125 deaths (13·7 per\r\n10,000 inhabitants) in 1871, and 25 deaths in 1872.\r\n\r\nIn Wiesbaden an epidemic began in December 1870, and reached its climax\r\nin February. The population of the city was 35,463, and of these 6\r\nsuccumbed to small-pox in 1870, 71 in 1871, and two in 1872. Regarding\r\nthe origin of this small epidemic no information is available.\r\n\r\n\r\n   _(b) The Dissemination of Small-pox in Saxony in the Years 1870–2_\r\n\r\nThe kingdom of Saxony experienced a very severe epidemic of small-pox in\r\nconsequence of the Franco-German War. The wide dissemination of the\r\ndisease is attributed by Wunderlich to the fact that vaccination, in\r\nconsequence of the wild agitation of the anti-vaccinationists, was\r\ninsufficiently practised; prior to the year 1874 vaccination was not\r\ncompulsory in Saxony. Even before the war broke out small-pox had\r\nappeared in Saxony in the form of epidemics, e.g. in Chemnitz and\r\nFreiberg. The following table indicates the number of persons, all told,\r\nthat succumbed to small-pox in Saxony:[275]\r\n\r\n           1871 9,935 (estimate) 38·8 per 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n           1872 5,863            22·8 per 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n           1873 1,772             6·9 per 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOf the immobile troops stationed in Saxony, the total number of whom was\r\n17,628, some 506, all told, contracted the disease and 30 succumbed to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nRegarding the dissemination of small-pox in Leipzig and vicinity we have\r\naccurate information.[276] In Leipzig itself small-pox patients were\r\nhoused only in the city hospital. A small epidemic of the disease had\r\nraged there in the years 1868–9. In the year 1870, eighteen patients\r\nwere committed to the hospital in the months of January-July, after\r\nwhich there were no more cases until October; on the 22nd, 23rd, and\r\n31st of that month a single patient, each time a French prisoner, was\r\ntaken to the hospital. On November 7 a laundress employed in the\r\nhospital contracted the disease; the first case among the civil\r\ninhabitants was reported on November 10. In December an epidemic began\r\nwhich spread rapidly and reached its climax in April. The following\r\ntable indicates the number of patients committed to the hospital in the\r\nmonths mentioned:\r\n\r\n                            March (1871) 384\r\n                            April        388\r\n                            May          361\r\n                            June         231\r\n                            July          73\r\n\r\nThe epidemic lasted until the year 1872, and the highest mortality was\r\nin the month of May 1871; the number of deaths caused by the disease in\r\nthe various months was as follows:\r\n\r\n                          October (1870)    1\r\n                          November          2\r\n                          December          9\r\n                          January (1871)   20\r\n                          February         47\r\n                          March           117\r\n                          April           233\r\n                          May             246\r\n                          June            205\r\n                          July             91\r\n                          August           32\r\n                          September        24\r\n                          October          14\r\n                          November         13\r\n                          December         10\r\n                          January (1872)    4\r\n                          February          5\r\n                          March and April   4\r\n\r\nAmong these 1,077 victims of the disease were 21 soldiers and 27\r\noutsiders from the surrounding villages. The disease was very virulent.\r\nOf the 1,727 patients treated in the hospital 253 died (14·7 per cent).\r\nThe population of Leipzig in the year 1871 was 106,922, so that the\r\n1,052 deaths of the year 1871 correspond to a mortality of 98·4 per\r\n10,000 inhabitants. Of 3,726 prisoners, 98 (76·3 per 10,000) contracted\r\nthe disease and 9 died.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Leipzig no case of small-pox was officially reported\r\nbetween the months of May and October. When the disease broke out in the\r\ncity of Leipzig it was of course inevitable, in view of the constant\r\nintercourse between the city and the surrounding country, that it should\r\nspread rapidly among the working people who were employed in the city\r\nand lived in the country, first to the immediate vicinity, and then,\r\nfollowing the chief lines of traffic, to the more remote\r\nlocalities.[277] Of 113 places 106 were attacked; only two\r\npeasant-villages and five isolated farm-estates were spared. The\r\nvillages inhabited by working people were much more severely attacked\r\nthan those inhabited by farmers and peasants. The progress of the\r\nepidemic is indicated by the following figures, which Siegel says are\r\nincomplete, since not all the cases were reported, and which correspond\r\nat best to only one-half of the actual number of cases and deaths:\r\n\r\n                                  _Cases._ _Deaths._\r\n                   October (1870)        2\r\n                   November              9         3\r\n                   December             22         5\r\n                   January (1871)      107        16\r\n                   February            216        42\r\n                   March               398       103\r\n                   April               816       255\r\n                   May                 944       367\r\n                   June                732       311\r\n                   July                288       161\r\n                   August               94        68\r\n                   September            45        35\r\n                   October              38        16\r\n                   November             41        25\r\n                   December             44        18\r\n                   January (1872)       26        12\r\n                   February             28        20\r\n                   March                18        11\r\n                   April                 6        10\r\n                   May                   5         6\r\n                   June                  2         1\r\n                   July                  —         —\r\n\r\nAccording to this table the number of deaths in the district of Leipzig,\r\nthe population of which was 97,100, was eight in the year 1870, 1,417\r\n(145·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871, and 60 in the year\r\n1872. Accurate figures regarding the ratio of deaths to total cases\r\ncannot be computed; at all events small-pox raged very severely, owing\r\npartly to insufficient vaccination, and partly to the wretched\r\nconditions in which the working people lived.\r\n\r\nIn Dresden, mild epidemics of small-pox had raged in the year 1864 and\r\nagain in the years 1867–8; between the months of January and August 1870\r\nnot a single small-pox patient was taken to the city hospital; the first\r\ncase was committed to the hospital on September 27 of that year, and\r\nafter that two more persons contracted the disease in a barrack. The\r\ndisease spread from there, at first along the streets in the vicinity of\r\nthe barrack, and then throughout the Antonstadt, Neustadt, and finally\r\nthe Altstadt. The epidemic reached its climax among the civil\r\ninhabitants in April 1871, in the garrison in January. The following\r\ntable indicates the number of patients committed to the city hospital in\r\nthe months mentioned:[278]\r\n\r\n                          September (1870)   2\r\n                          October           12\r\n                          November          22\r\n                          December          31\r\n                          January (1871)    60\r\n                          February          82\r\n                          March             95\r\n                          April            186\r\n                          May              173\r\n                          June             148\r\n                          July              78\r\n                          August            38\r\n                          September         18\r\n                          October           32\r\n                          November          40\r\n                          December          62\r\n                          January (1872)    59\r\n                          February          57\r\n                          March             30\r\n                          April             40\r\n                          May               13\r\n                          June              13\r\n\r\nAll told, there were fifteen deaths due to the disease in Dresden in the\r\nyear 1870, 570 deaths (32·7 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871,\r\nand 151 deaths (8·4 per 10,000) in the year 1872. Among the prisoners\r\nthere were 150 cases of the disease, and of these nine were fatal; in\r\nthe garrison there were 413 cases and twenty-one deaths.\r\n\r\nThe epidemic of small-pox in Chemnitz, at least the beginning of it, was\r\nin no way connected with the war. An exhaustive report made out by\r\nFlinzer,[279] who carefully investigated the conditions relative to\r\nvaccination in the year 1871, furnishes us the following figures; of\r\n64,255 inhabitants 53,891 were vaccinated, 5,712 were unvaccinated,\r\n4,652 had survived a previous attack of small-pox, and only 1,928\r\npersons had been vaccinated more than once. The epidemic of small-pox\r\nbegan in January 1870, and reached its climax in December of that year.\r\nFrom March 1871 to September 1872, only a few cases of the disease were\r\nobserved, but after September the number of cases suddenly began to grow\r\nlarger, resulting in a second severe epidemic, which continued to\r\nincrease in severity until March 1873. The mortality statistics found in\r\nFlinzer’s report are reproduced below; they go only as far as April\r\n1873, but after that the epidemic abated considerably:\r\n\r\n                             1870. 1871. 1872. 1873.\r\n                   January       1    25     3    43\r\n                   February      3    15     1    68\r\n                   March         5     4     5    74\r\n                   April         8     3     4    37\r\n                   May           8     3     6\r\n                   June          8     1    10\r\n                   July         19          14\r\n                   August       27           6\r\n                   September    20     1     6\r\n                   October      28     1    12\r\n                   November     28     1    27\r\n                   December     38     2    32\r\n                               ———    ——   ———   ———\r\n                     Total     193    56   126   222\r\n\r\nA particularly good idea of the protection against small-pox afforded by\r\nvaccination is given in the Chemnitz statistics for the years 1870–1. Of\r\n53,891 vaccinated persons 953 (1·8 per cent) contracted the disease in\r\nthose two years and seven succumbed to it, all of whom were more than\r\nten years of age; of 5,712 unvaccinated persons, almost one-half\r\ncontracted the disease (2,643 or 46·3 per cent, to be precise), and of\r\nthese 243 (9·16 of those taken sick) died. Of those who died, 102 were\r\nless than one year old, 51 were less than two years old, 47 were in\r\ntheir fourth or fifth year, and 20 were from five to ten years of age.\r\n\r\nHow dangerous small-pox showed itself to be after the Franco-German War\r\nis indicated by a report of Geissler[280] regarding the epidemic in\r\nMeerane, a manufacturing town of some 20,000 inhabitants. There, between\r\nOctober 1871 and May 1872, no less than 460 persons (434 children and 26\r\nadults) succumbed to small-pox, i.e. 230 per 10,000 inhabitants. Of the\r\nchildren 80·3, and of the adults 26·3, succumbed to the disease in the\r\ncourse of the epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n             _(c) Small-pox in Bavaria in the Years 1871–2_\r\n\r\nIn the year 1866 Bavaria had an epidemic of small-pox, which, although\r\nit abated considerably in the following years, did not leave the country\r\nentirely free from the disease; it was, however, confined to a very few\r\nlocalities in the year 1870. In Upper Bavaria cases were reported in\r\nthat year only in Altötting and Friedberg; in Lower Bavaria absolutely\r\nno cases were reported; in Upper Franconia a small epidemic raged in\r\nAugust 1870, in the district of Forchheim; in Central Franconia, where\r\nin the year 1868 a rather severe epidemic had raged, the disease had\r\nalmost entirely disappeared by 1870; Lower Franconia and Swabia,\r\nfinally, had only sporadic cases of the disease. French prisoners and\r\nhomeward-bound soldiers, away on furlough, caused the pestilence, as was\r\nreported from all sides, to break out anew; the rapid dissemination of\r\nthe disease, according to these reports, was helped by persons coming in\r\ndirect contact with French prisoners in crowded places, by teamsters\r\nreturning from France, by German fugitives from France, by persons\r\nhandling the linen and clothes of patients, and by the sale of woollen\r\nblankets and other things which the French prisoners brought with them.\r\nThe following table indicates the number of people who succumbed to\r\nsmall-pox in Bavaria:[281]\r\n\r\n                                _Total._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n     Oct. 1, 1865–Oct.  1, 1866      577                       1·2\r\n     Oct. 1, 1866–Oct.  1, 1867    1,210                       2·5\r\n     Oct. 1, 1867–Oct.  1, 1868      917                       1·9\r\n     Oct. 1, 1868–Oct.  1, 1869      487                       1·0\r\n     Oct. 1, 1869–Oct.  1, 1870      363                       0·8\r\n     Oct. 1, 1870–Dec. 31, 1870      224\r\n     1871                          5,070                      10·4\r\n     1872                          2,992                       6·1\r\n     1873                            869                       1·8\r\n     1874                            263                       0·5\r\n     1875                             87                       0·2\r\n\r\nMunich fared pretty well, and the civil population suffered less than\r\nthe soldiers.[282] Not a single case of small-pox occurred there during\r\nthe entire year of 1870. In November an officer suffering from dysentery\r\nreturned home from France, and shortly after his arrival he was taken\r\nsick with small-pox, which later attacked two members of his family. In\r\nthe first part of the year 1871 small-pox became more and more\r\nwidespread, and reached its climax in June. The total number of deaths\r\nin the year 1870 was 7, in the year 1871 it was 150 (8·9 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants), and in the year 1872 it was 108 (6·4 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants).

A Bavarian soldier and two French\r\nprisoners succumbed there to small-pox in December 1870. In January the\r\ndisease spread to the civil population, increased rapidly in severity,\r\nand reached its climax in May. After abating a little in September, the\r\nepidemic started up anew and did not disappear entirely until May 1872.\r\nThe number of deaths is indicated by the monthly reports found in the\r\nBavarian _Ärztliches Intelligenzblatt_, a few of which we reproduce:\r\n\r\n                           January (1871)  8\r\n                           February       14\r\n                           March          24\r\n                           April          35\r\n                           May            42\r\n                           June           34\r\n                           July           17\r\n                           August         14\r\n                           September       2\r\n                           October         9\r\n                           November       14\r\n                           December\r\n                           January (1872) 17\r\n                           February       18\r\n                           March          11\r\n                           April           8\r\n                           May             6\r\n                           June and July   5\r\n\r\nThe total number of deaths, some of which are not included in the\r\nmonthly lists, was 234 (45·7 per 10,000 inhabitants) in the year 1871,\r\nand 71 (13·8 per 10,000) in the year 1872.\r\n\r\nIn Regensburg sixteen persons (eleven prisoners, three soldiers, and two\r\ncivilians) contracted the disease in the latter part of 1870; in 1871 as\r\nmany as 123 persons contracted the disease, and of these thirty-three\r\ndied. In Bamberg the first two cases were reported in December 1870, the\r\ndisease having been brought there from Würzburg; up to August 1871 some\r\nninety persons contracted the disease, among them twenty-three prisoners\r\nand five soldiers; of these, eight died. After a short lull, new cases\r\nwere reported (between December 1, 1871, and August 1872); there were\r\nthirty-one cases, all told (seventeen of the patients being soldiers),\r\nand only one death.[284]\r\n\r\n\r\n           _(d) Small-pox in Württemberg in the Years 1871–2_\r\n\r\nIn Württemberg, where vaccination had been compulsory since 1818, but\r\nhad been frequently evaded in the ‘sixties in consequence of the\r\nagitation of the anti-vaccinationists, an epidemic of small-pox raged in\r\nthe years 1863–7, causing, all told, 804 deaths. In the latter part of\r\nthe year 1869 a new epidemic began and carried away many people,\r\nparticularly in Stuttgart, but also in the rest of the Neckar district.\r\nWith the arrival of the French prisoners the number of cases increased\r\nrapidly, and the disease appeared in many places which had never before\r\nbeen attacked. The following table indicates the number of reported\r\ncases and deaths:[285]\r\n\r\n      _Year._ _Cases._ _Deaths._ _Deaths per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n      1868         559        34                              0.2\r\n      1869       1,488       133                              0.7\r\n      1870       5,208       529                              2.9\r\n      1871      10,848     2,050                             11.3\r\n      1872       ?         1,164                              6.4\r\n\r\nBut the reports were not always complete, for the reason that many cases\r\nwere kept secret.

In the year 1869, after an average of twenty cases per\r\nmonth had been officially reported up to August, the disease raged more\r\nand more furiously, so that the total number of cases for the entire\r\nyear was no less than 744. In the following year the disease continued\r\nto increase in severity until February, when it began to abate somewhat,\r\nso that in October 1870 only thirteen cases were reported. Then the\r\nnumber of cases steadily increased again until June 1871, when the\r\nepidemic once more subsided a little, only to reach another moderate\r\nclimax in November. In the middle of the year 1872 the epidemic suddenly\r\ncame to an end.

In the garrison, which numbered\r\nsome 3,000 men, only four mild cases occurred, inasmuch as all recruits\r\nhad been vaccinated in Württemberg since the year 1833. But in the\r\nlatter part of the year 1870 there arrived a battalion of the Landwehr,\r\na third of whom had never done active service, and had therefore never\r\nbeen revaccinated in accordance with the military regulation; after\r\nthis, numerous cases were reported in the garrison (October 1870 to\r\nApril 1871), although none of them resulted fatally.\r\n\r\nThe connexion between the epidemic in the stronghold of Ulm and the war\r\nwas very obvious. Says Volz:[287] ‘After the summer of 1870 had produced\r\nonly a few cases of small-pox, and a long pause (August to the beginning\r\nof November) had intervened, during which we saw absolutely no traces of\r\nthe disease, the arrival of French prisoners caused the disease to\r\nspread far and wide, constituting a part of the epidemic which raged\r\nthroughout almost all of Europe. In the latter part of September the\r\nfirst cases of small-pox were observed among the prisoners. But a month\r\nand a half elapsed before the disease made its appearance among the\r\ncivil inhabitants; one of the first cases was traced to the beds in the\r\nbarracks. In January 1871 the disease was conveyed to Söflingen by a\r\nwoman from that place who had been employed as a nurse in the military\r\nhospital at New Ulm. The constant intercourse between Söflingen and Ulm\r\nsoon asserted itself through the infection of working-men who were\r\nemployed in the latter place and lived in the former. At the same time\r\nthe disease frequently appeared among the laundry-owners, washerwomen,\r\nscrubwomen, innkeepers, sutler-women, and generally among persons who\r\nwere employed in any capacity in the field-hospitals and forts. Then,\r\ntoo, patients kept arriving who had been infected in Baden, Switzerland,\r\nBavaria, North Germany, and in regions which, like ours, had been\r\ninfected by prisoners and fugitives arriving from France. In the\r\ndistrict of Beimerstetten the disease also made its appearance, having\r\nbeen brought there in a carpet which a woman purchased from a Bavarian\r\nsoldier who had accompanied a transport of prisoners. In addition to\r\nthis woman, sixteen more persons contracted the disease, and three of\r\nthem died.’\r\n\r\nIn the city of Ulm thirty-six civilians (13·7 per 10,000 inhabitants)\r\nsuccumbed to the disease, while in the district of Ulm forty-six persons\r\n(21·2 per 10,000) died. The climax of the epidemic was reached in May;\r\nafter a short lull in August and September it started up again and\r\nlasted until the autumn of 1872. The garrison at Ulm was also attacked,\r\nbut not very severely.\r\n\r\nOf the immobile troops in Württemberg, who averaged 10,122 men, 7·9 per\r\n1,000 contracted the disease. Of the French prisoners that were held in\r\nWürttemberg, 390 contracted the disease (the climax, 199 cases, was\r\nreached in December). The maximum number of prisoners was 12,958, and\r\n30·1 per 1,000 contracted the disease and twenty-eight died (7·2 per\r\ncent of those taken sick).\r\n\r\nIn Heilbronn,[288] as in Stuttgart, a small epidemic had raged before\r\nthe war broke out; from February to July 1870 some forty persons had\r\ncontracted the disease. From August to October no more cases were\r\nreported, but in November a new epidemic began and spread with great\r\nrapidity. The following table indicates the number of cases and deaths\r\nin the small-pox hospital at Heilbronn:\r\n\r\n                                 _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                 November (1870)           2\r\n                 December                 19         2\r\n                 January (1871)           51         3\r\n                 February                 66         9\r\n                 March                    95        13\r\n                 April                    83        14\r\n                 May                      95        17\r\n                 June                     47        11\r\n                 July                     18         2\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, twenty-seven cases of the disease were reported in\r\nthe city, so that the total number of patients was perhaps as large as\r\n1,000. All told, seventy-one persons died in Heilbronn in the course of\r\nthe epidemic.\r\n\r\n\r\n              _(e) Small-pox in Baden in the Years 1871–2_\r\n\r\nIn Baden a great many cases of small-pox were reported among the French\r\nprisoners; their maximum number was 12,083, and of these 512 (42·4 per\r\n1,000) contracted the disease, and 21 (4·1 per cent of those taken sick)\r\nsuccumbed to it. The largest number of cases (133) was observed in\r\nJanuary. Regarding the distribution of the French prisoners among the\r\nvarious dépôts no information is available, while regarding the immobile\r\nGerman troops we know absolutely nothing. Among the civil inhabitants a\r\nsmall epidemic raged as early as the year 1869, particularly in the\r\ndistrict of Mannheim. In the latter part of the year 1870 a considerable\r\nnumber of cases was reported, and a rather severe epidemic rapidly\r\ndeveloped. According to a written report of the Baden Bureau of\r\nStatistics, the number of deaths due to small-pox per 10,000 inhabitants\r\nwas as follows:\r\n\r\n                     _District._      1870. 1871. 1872.\r\n                 Constance              0·6  18·8   3·2\r\n                 Freiburg im Breisgau   3·5  27·5   2·3\r\n                 Karlsruhe              3·7  33·1   5·2\r\n                 Mannheim               1·0   6·5   3·4\r\n                                        ———  ————   ———\r\n                 All Baden              2·4  21·7   3·5\r\n\r\nOf those cities which at that time had more than 10,000 inhabitants,\r\nMannheim and Karlsruhe suffered very little; Rastatt, Freiburg, and\r\nConstance were the most severely attacked.

In many places, to be sure, it was impossible to\r\nprove that the disease was directly connected with the war. Reissner and\r\nNeidhart mention numerous cases in which the disease was communicated by\r\nfield-soldiers who were sent from France to Hessian reserve-lazarets\r\n(Pfungstadt, Lampertheim, Crumstadt, and others), by furloughed\r\nfield-soldiers (Lauterbach, Lorsch, Eschollbrücken, and others), by\r\nfugitives from Paris at the beginning of the war (Giessen,\r\nGross-Eichen), by French prisoners who had contracted the disease in\r\ncamp or during transport, by teamsters returning home from France\r\n(Worms, Grossgerau), by military effects—such as carpets, clothing,\r\ntent-canvas (three places in the district of Grossgerau), and especially\r\nby people who had visited the prisons where the French soldiers were\r\nconfined (Mayence, Darmstadt, &c.).\r\n\r\nNot a single district in Hesse was spared during the epidemic of the\r\nyears 1870–2. The district of Mayence suffered worst of all; then came\r\nGiessen, Offenbach, and Darmstadt, all districts in which moderately\r\nlarge cities were located. The following table indicates the number of\r\ndeaths per 10,000 inhabitants in the various cities and districts:\r\n\r\n                                      1870. 1871. 1872.\r\n                 Mayence (city)        13·5  37·4   3·2\r\n                 Mayence (district)     3·2  33·3   0·3\r\n                 Darmstadt (city)       3·5  12·9   0·8\r\n                 Darmstadt (district)   2·9  21·7   1·8\r\n                 Giessen (city)         7·4   9·0\r\n                 Giessen (district)    11·8   9·6   1·0\r\n                 Offenbach (city)       0·4  15·9   6·6\r\n                 Offenbach (district)   0·7  12·7   4·7\r\n\r\nIn the city of Mayence about thirty cases of small-pox were reported in\r\nthe year 1870 before the war broke out. ‘Shortly after the beginning of\r\nthe war,’ say Reissner and Neidhart, ‘numerous prisoners were interned\r\nin Mayence, and among them cases of small-pox had not infrequently been\r\nobserved beforehand. Notwithstanding the admonitions of the military\r\nphysician, a barrack inside the city was set aside as a lazaret for\r\nthem. At first in the near-by streets, but later on throughout the\r\nentire city, an epidemic now began to rage such as Mayence had never\r\nbefore experienced in the memory of man. It lasted throughout the entire\r\nyear of 1871 and did not come to an end until the middle of the\r\nfollowing year.’ The epidemic reached its climax in Mayence in January\r\n1871, abated a little until March, started up again in April, and then\r\nslowly decreased in fury until it finally disappeared altogether. In the\r\ngarrison at Mayence 190 men contracted the disease in the years 1870–2\r\nand nine succumbed to it; of the prisoners of war 934 contracted the\r\ndisease and seventeen per cent of them died. The pestilence was\r\ndisseminated in all directions from Mayence, partly by people from the\r\nsurrounding country who visited the city, and partly by other means.\r\nThus, for example, the disease broke out with unusual severity in\r\nBretzenheim, a village situated a mile or so away from the barracks\r\nwhere the prisoners were confined; the inhabitants of the village in\r\nmany instances used the contents of the ditches in which the defecations\r\nof the prisoners were thrown to fertilize their fields, and they also\r\nbought straw and other waste products in the city.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Giessen no cases of small-pox occurred in the year 1870\r\nprior to the outbreak of the war. The first cases observed there were in\r\nSeptember, but the epidemic, which reached its climax in December, did\r\nnot become very widespread. In Darmstadt 50 cases of small-pox were\r\nreported in the year 1870 prior to the outbreak of the war, and after\r\nthe war began some 50–60 cases were observed before the end of the year.\r\nThe epidemic, which became only moderately widespread, lasted throughout\r\nthe entire year of 1871 and did not disappear until the middle of the\r\nyear 1872.\r\n\r\n\r\n_(g) General Observations regarding the Epidemic of Small-pox in Germany\r\n                          in the Years 1871–2_\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the Franco-German War an epidemic of small-pox raged\r\nthroughout Germany, the extent and virulence of which exceeded that of\r\nany other epidemic that occurred in the entire course of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. Unfortunately, in the case of a number of small States, we have\r\nno statistics relating to the number of deaths caused by the disease.\r\nThe figures which I was able to obtain I have compiled in the following\r\ntable. In the case of Alsace and Lorraine, as well as of Oldenburg, the\r\ntwo Mecklenburgs, and the other small North German States, absolutely no\r\nfigures are available; judging by their population and by the prevalence\r\nof small-pox in the States surrounding them, we may safely estimate the\r\nnumber of deaths caused by small-pox in them in the years 1871–2 at some\r\n4,000.\r\n\r\n ───────────────┬───────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────\r\n _States in the │_Population│\r\n     German     │  Dec. 1,  │\r\n Confederation._│  1871._   │        _Deaths caused by small-pox._\r\n ───────────────┼───────────┼────────┬────────┬──────────┬──────────┬─────\r\n        〃       │     〃     │ 1869.  │ 1870.  │  1871.   │  1872.   │1873.\r\n ───────────────┼───────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────\r\n Prussia        │ 24,691,085│   4,655│   4,200│    59,839│    66,660│8,932\r\n Bavaria        │  4,863,450│456[291]│516[292]│     5,070│     2,992│  869\r\n Saxony         │  2,556,244│   ?    │   ?    │     9,935│     5,863│1,772\r\n Württemberg    │  1,818,539│     133│     529│     2,050│     1,164│   55\r\n Baden[292]     │  1,461,562│      67│     343│     3,176│       511│  ?\r\n Hesse          │    852,894│      20│     248│     1,028│       167│    3\r\n Brunswick[291] │    312,170│   ?    │       2│       269│       215│  ?\r\n Lübeck         │     52,158│        │       1│        36│        15│\r\n Bremen[291]    │    122,402│        │        │        54│        41│    3\r\n Hamburg        │    338,974│      20│      83│     3,647│       323│    3\r\n Other States   │  2,439,576│   ?    │   ?    │4,000[292]│4,000[292]│  ?\r\n Alsace-Lorraine│  1,549,738│   ?    │   ?    │    ?     │    ?     │  ?\r\n ───────────────┼───────────┼────────┼────────┼──────────┼──────────┼─────\r\n All Germany    │ 41,058,792│        │        │    89,104│    81,951│\r\n ───────────────┴───────────┴────────┴────────┴──────────┴──────────┴─────\r\n\r\nThe above compilation leaves no doubt that the disease was borne into\r\nGermany from France. The contagion was conveyed into Germany by\r\nprisoners and field-soldiers, some of whom were infected beforehand and\r\nwere sick when they got there, others of whom were still apparently\r\nhealthy, and still others of whom had reached the convalescent stage of\r\nthe disease, and less frequently by civil persons (teamsters and\r\nfugitives); but the prisoners were by far the most active influence in\r\nspreading the disease. The dissemination usually took place in the\r\nfollowing manner; in the dépôts where the prisoners were confined,\r\nsmall-pox epidemics of varying severity broke out; from all sides the\r\npeople streamed in to see the prisoners, and when they went away they\r\nconveyed the infection wherever they went, at first, of course, around\r\nin the immediate vicinity. This is most evident in the eastern\r\nprovinces, where these dépôts soon came to be dangerous seats of\r\nsmall-pox infection; the near-by districts were very severely attacked\r\nas early as the year 1871, whereas the more remote districts did not\r\nbegin to suffer severely until the year 1872.\r\n\r\nThe development of a small trade between the prisoners and civil\r\ninhabitants in articles belonging to dead soldiers, or in personal\r\neffects, also helped to spread the disease; moreover, certain\r\nunscrupulous sick-attendants, when they were instructed to destroy such\r\narticles, frequently disobeyed the order and secretly sold them, thereby\r\ngiving an additional impetus to the dissemination of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a large part of the population was not vaccinated, and\r\nthat the necessity of revaccination was not properly recognized (only\r\nsoldiers were revaccinated), also helped to increase the severity of the\r\npestilence. In all the South German States compulsory vaccination had\r\nexisted for decades, but its strict enforcement was everywhere hindered\r\nby the activity of the anti-vaccinationists; Prussia and Saxony did not\r\nintroduce compulsory vaccination until the year 1874. Revaccination\r\namong the civil inhabitants was rarely practised in either North or\r\nSouth Germany. These differences in the vaccination laws account for the\r\nfact that small-pox raged more severely in North Germany than in South\r\nGermany; this is also distinctly shown by the tables reproduced in the\r\ncourse of this chapter. The fact that the civil inhabitants in general\r\nwere more thoroughly vaccinated also explains why the percentage of\r\nchildren that succumbed to small-pox was so much smaller in South\r\nGermany than in North Germany.\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths caused by small-pox in the epidemic of the years\r\n1870–2 was greatly increased by the extremely virulent character of the\r\ndisease. Of course one cannot estimate the number of deaths caused by\r\nsmall-pox among the civil inhabitants from the number of reported cases\r\nof the disease, since the reports sent in were always very incomplete.\r\nWe know that the mortality of small-pox depends very much upon\r\nvaccination; vaccinated persons succumb far less frequently to the\r\ndisease than unvaccinated persons. This fact explains why among the\r\nGerman field-soldiers, who were constantly subjected to hardships and\r\nprivations of all kinds, only 5·75 per cent of the patients died,\r\nwhereas of the French prisoners some 13·85 per cent died. The mortality\r\namong the civil inhabitants of Germany was also very high; this was\r\nchiefly due to the fact that severe forms of the disease, particularly\r\nhemorrhagic small-pox, were of frequent occurrence. As authority for\r\nthis we can only refer to these reports of the hospitals; but since\r\nsmall children, amongst whom the mortality of small-pox is very high,\r\nare less represented in them, and, on the other hand, since mild cases\r\namong adults can more readily be withdrawn from hospital treatment, one\r\ncannot accept without qualification the experience of the hospitals.\r\nAccording to Wunderlich, of 681 patients treated in the Leipzig hospital\r\nbetween the year 1852 and July 1870, only 29 (4·2 per cent) died,\r\nwhereas in the years 1870–1, of 1,727 patients treated, 253 (14·7 per\r\ncent) died. In Breslau, whereas in former epidemics an average of seven\r\nper cent of the patients died, in the epidemic of the years 1871–2 no\r\nless than 13·4 per cent died. Guttstadt also states that the mortality\r\nin the Berlin hospitals was fifteen per cent, whereas the number of\r\ndeaths caused by the disease in former years was much smaller. We have\r\nseen above that 21·7 per cent of the patients taken to the Hôtel-Dieu in\r\nLyons died. It is unnecessary to adduce further statistics; all\r\ncontemporary observers agreed that the epidemic involved an extremely\r\nsevere and virulent form of the disease, and that this same virulence\r\ncharacterized the disease wherever it made its appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _The Epidemics of Small-pox that raged in the European, and in a few\r\n of the non-European States in connexion with the Franco-German War of\r\n                                1870–1_\r\n\r\n\r\n                           _(a) Switzerland_\r\n\r\nSwitzerland was exposed to great danger in consequence of the passage of\r\nGeneral Bourbaki’s army, which consisted partly of very young soldiers\r\nwho had suffered great hardships, including cold and hunger, and which\r\ncontained large numbers of men who were suffering from small-pox. The\r\nlittle country was called upon to take in some 85,000 men; when the\r\nlatter were examined on the frontier a large number of them were found\r\nto be infected with small-pox and were held at Verrière in France. But\r\nthis did not prevent the disease from being conveyed across the border.\r\nOf the French prisoners confined there, 137, all told, succumbed to\r\nsmall-pox.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately no mortality statistics giving the cause of death were\r\ncompiled in Switzerland until the year 1876, so that we have no figures\r\nindicating the prevalence of small-pox. The western cantons were most\r\nexposed to the infection. In Berne, which at that time had a population\r\nof 506,511, no less than 2,637 persons, excluding the French prisoners\r\ninterned there, contracted the disease between October 1870 and\r\nSeptember 1872; in the year 1871 there were 9·6 deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants.[293] In the city of Basel, which was attacked as early as\r\nNovember 1870, the epidemic reached its climax in February; the number\r\nof deaths there was as follows:[294]\r\n\r\n                    _Total no._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n               1870           7                       1·6\r\n               1871          64                      14·0\r\n               1872          13                       2·7\r\n\r\nThe Canton of Basel (Land) was attacked somewhat less severely; in the\r\nyear 1871 only 59 persons (10·9 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed there\r\nto small-pox. In the Canton of Solothurn, which was infected from Olten,\r\na railway junction, 13·9 persons per 10,000 inhabitants died in the year\r\n1871. In the Canton of Waadt small-pox broke out, according to Vogt, in\r\nthe district of Vivis in November 1870, and 200 persons contracted the\r\ndisease in the course of that month. In the two small-pox hospitals at\r\nLausanne, 351 patients were treated between November 20, 1870, and the\r\nend of 1871, and 62 of them died.\r\n\r\nThe small-pox epidemic spread very rapidly from the West throughout all\r\nthe rest of Switzerland, partly in consequence of the distribution of\r\nthe French prisoners among the other cantons, and partly in consequence\r\nof inland intercourse. Of the French prisoners interned in the Canton of\r\nZurich 180, according to A. Brunner,[295] contracted the disease and 31\r\ndied of it. The patients were sheltered in the small-pox camp at\r\nWinterthur, whence the infection spread to many places. In February 1871\r\nthere was a rapid increase in the number of cases; the epidemic reached\r\nits climax in March and April, and then steadily abated until June. The\r\nstatistics for the Canton of Zurich, which had a population of 285,915,\r\nwere as follows:\r\n\r\n                            _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                       1870          85         6\r\n                       1871       1,068       137\r\n                       1872         200        18\r\n                       1873          22         —\r\n\r\nIn the Canton of Thurgau, according to Vogt, there were 9·2 deaths per\r\n10,000 inhabitants in the year 1871, in the Canton of Schaffhausen 4·0,\r\nand in the Canton of St. Gall 3·3. During the small-pox epidemic that\r\nraged in the Canton of Schwyz in the year 1871 the communities of Gersau\r\nand Küssnacht were severely attacked; throughout the entire canton 56\r\npersons (11·7 per 10,000 inhabitants) succumbed to the disease. The\r\nCantons of Glarus, Unterwalden, Zug, and Graubünden were also rather\r\nseverely attacked. In the Canton of Tessin, whither the disease, which\r\nfirst appeared in Locarno, had been conveyed by travellers from Paris,\r\nand where 62 cases of it and 6 deaths had been reported up to June, a\r\nnew epidemic broke out in Personico, resulting in 15 deaths; in the year\r\n1871 there were 11 deaths reported throughout the entire canton. In the\r\nCanton of Willis small-pox broke out only sporadically.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _(b) Belgium_\r\n\r\nIn numerous places throughout Belgium small-pox had appeared in the\r\nfirst part of the year 1870 in the form of widespread epidemics, a fact\r\nwhich we can readily explain when we consider the country’s proximity to\r\nFrance, which was everywhere infected with the disease. Thus, according\r\nto Larondelle, a severe epidemic of small-pox broke out in February\r\n1870, in the city of Verviers, which at that time had some 33,000\r\ninhabitants, and lasted until January 1871; in the year 1870 no less\r\nthan 428 deaths were reported there, and 185 of them occurred in the\r\nmonth of December alone. When the war began French fugitives kept\r\nbringing the disease into the country, especially after the battle of\r\nSedan, when more than 10,000 French soldiers were interned on Belgian\r\nsoil, some in Beverloo and others in the citadel of Antwerp. From these\r\nplaces the epidemic spread throughout all Belgium. In Brussels, for\r\nexample, no cases of small-pox were reported in July 1870, in August\r\nthere were two cases, in September two, in October twenty-two, in\r\nNovember sixty-nine, and in December 101.

In the year 1870 the number of deaths\r\nincreased considerably, and in the following year reached an appalling\r\nheight.[297] The following table indicates the annual mortality of the\r\ndisease:\r\n\r\n                _Total no. deaths._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n           1869                  50                      0·14\r\n           1870                 706                      1·96\r\n           1871              15,787                     43·55\r\n           1872               3,731                     10·21\r\n           1873                 351                      0·95\r\n\r\nThus both Belgium and the Netherlands had a very high small-pox\r\nmortality in the year 1871; as elsewhere, the cause is traceable to\r\nrepeated transplantations of the disease, and to the fact that\r\nvaccination was insufficiently practised.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             _(d) Austria_\r\n\r\nIn the years 1872–4 Austria suffered severely from small-pox; the total\r\nnumber of deaths per annum caused by the disease is indicated by the\r\nfollowing table:[298]\r\n\r\n                _Total no. deaths._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n           1870               6,177                       3·0\r\n           1871               8,074                       3·9\r\n           1872              39,368                      19·0\r\n           1873              65,274                      31·2\r\n           1874              36,442                      17·3\r\n           1875              12,151                       5·7\r\n\r\nAlthough small-pox was usually conveyed into Austria from the East and\r\nSouth (Italy), nevertheless the connexion between the epidemic in\r\nAustria of the years 1872–4, and the great German epidemic is too\r\nobvious to be overlooked.

On the other hand, a considerable\r\nincrease in the number of deaths caused by small-pox is observed in the\r\nyear 1871 in Lower Austria and Salzburg, and to a certain extent in East\r\nAustria, Moravia, Silesia, and Bohemia; in Lower Austria, Salzburg, and\r\nSilesia the epidemic reached its climax in the year 1872, whereas in\r\nUpper Austria, Bohemia, and Moravia this climax did not come until the\r\nyear 1873. The same is true of Vorarlberg, while the crown-lands of\r\nStyria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Tyrol were most severely attacked by\r\nthe disease in 1874. In Triest and Istria the climax of the epidemic was\r\nreached in 1872, in Görz and Gradiska in 1873. In Galicia, which had\r\nalways had a high small-pox mortality, the epidemic did not begin until\r\nthe year 1872; it reached its climax in the following year. In Bukowina\r\nthe climax did not come until the year 1874.\r\n\r\n‘To follow the progress of the disease according to political\r\ndistricts,’ says Daimer, ‘is instructive for the reason that, as was\r\nclearly shown at that time, it always spread slowly—a fact which was\r\nalso repeatedly observed in the case of other epidemics; thus, there was\r\nalways time enough to adopt appropriate measures aiming to check its\r\nprogress.’ There is a very marked difference between the epidemic of\r\nsmall-pox in East Austria and the one in Germany; the latter attacked\r\nall Germany within a short time, since the war had developed there a\r\nvery extensive intercourse. And even in Germany it was observed that the\r\ndisease was a long time in reaching those regions that were less\r\naffected by this intercourse.\r\n\r\nVienna was attacked with great severity by small-pox; so also was\r\nPrague, though to a lesser extent. The following table indicates the\r\nnumber of deaths caused by the disease per 10,000 inhabitants:\r\n\r\n                             _Vienna._ _Prague._\r\n                        1869       5·4       1·9\r\n                        1870       4·8       2·6\r\n                        1871       7·6       1·5\r\n                        1872      52·7      39·7\r\n                        1873      22·0      28·2\r\n                        1874      14·3       3·0\r\n                        1875      18·0       1·1\r\n\r\nBut in these cities the epidemic did not come to an end; epidemic\r\noutbreaks of small-pox continued to occur in Vienna until 1885, in\r\nPrague until 1893, and in a number of years (for example, 1877, 1880,\r\n1883, 1884, and 1888) the disease underwent some very important\r\nexacerbations.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _(e) Italy_\r\n\r\nSmall-pox is supposed to have been conveyed into Italy by the volunteers\r\nwho had fought under Garibaldi; they became infected with the disease in\r\nthe Department of Côte d’Or, where it had raged extensively, and then\r\nbrought it back with them when they returned home. In Milan 200–300\r\ncases per annum were usually reported prior to the year 1870. In the\r\nsummer of that year the number of cases greatly increased, terminating\r\nin the following year in a severe epidemic which reached its climax in\r\nSeptember and October. According to Felice del Agua,[299] there were\r\n1,287 cases and 152 deaths in the year 1870, and 4,467 cases and 866\r\ndeaths in the year 1871. In Rome small-pox made its appearance in\r\nOctober 1871, causing 335 deaths between October 10 and December 31,\r\n1871, and 727 deaths in the entire year of 1872. In the case of a large\r\nnumber of individual places we have reports regarding epidemics of\r\nsmall-pox, but I was unable to find a comprehensive account of the\r\nepidemic that raged at that time in Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    _(f) Great Britain and Ireland_\r\n\r\nOwing to the constant intercourse between England and France it was\r\ninevitable that small-pox should very soon be conveyed into England; the\r\npersons who conveyed it were probably French refugees. As on the\r\ncontinent, so also in England, small-pox was always prevalent; in the\r\nyears 1869 and 1870, however, it was not very widespread, and it did not\r\nbegin to gain much headway until the autumn of 1870. The number of\r\ndeaths caused by small-pox in England was:\r\n\r\n                    _All told._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n               1868       2,052                       0·9\r\n               1869       1,565                       0·7\r\n               1870       2,620                       1·2\r\n               1871      23,126                      10·1\r\n               1872      19,094                       8·3\r\n               1873       2,264                       1·0\r\n\r\nIn the first nine months of the year 1870 there was no increase in the\r\nsmall-pox mortality, but in the last three months, and from January 1871\r\non, the increase was very marked. The number of deaths caused by the\r\ndisease was:\r\n\r\n                                      1870. 1871.\r\n                       First            405 4,903\r\n                       Second quarter   446 7,012\r\n                       Third quarter    500 4,612\r\n                       Fourth quarter 1,229 6,380\r\n\r\nThese figures do not agree with the figures for the years 1870–1 given\r\nin the previous table, and the reason for this is not explained in the\r\nreport. The places where the disease first entered England were London,\r\nLiverpool, and the mining districts of Durham and South Wales\r\n(Monmouth). The compiler of the reports regarding the movement of the\r\npopulation in England in the year 1871 says:[300] ‘Nearly all the\r\nsmaller outbreaks may be more or less directly traced to one of these\r\ncentres; Brighton, for instance, doubtless suffered from its intimate\r\ncommunication with London. There is distinct evidence in many cases of\r\nthe introduction of the disease into sea-side towns by sailors, and\r\nconsidering its fatal prevalence in Holland, Belgium, and many parts of\r\nFrance, it is not a matter for great surprise that Southampton, Great\r\nGrimsby, and one or two other ports suffered from the epidemic. It is\r\nindeed very probable that the epidemic in London was due to the large\r\narrivals of French refugees during the latter part of the previous\r\nautumn. That the epidemic may to a great extent be traced to our foreign\r\ncommunications is beyond doubt, and it is to be regretted that the\r\nsteady decline of deaths from small-pox in the six years 1864–9 had\r\ninduced a certain apathy in the matter of vaccination, and thus left a\r\nlarge portion of the population unprotected from the disease. In times\r\nof severe epidemics large numbers of the vaccinated in some way or other\r\nalso suffer for the neglect which has left so many unvaccinated.’\r\n\r\nThe number of deaths caused by small-pox in London was:\r\n\r\n                    _All told._ _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n               1868         597                       1·9\r\n               1869         275                       0·9\r\n               1870         973                       3·0\r\n               1871       7,912                      24·2\r\n               1872       1,786                       5·4\r\n               1873         113                       0·3\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of the year 1871 some 2,400 persons succumbed to\r\nsmall-pox in London, in the second quarter 3,241, in the third quarter\r\n1,255, and in the fourth quarter 980. The epidemic broke out in the East\r\nEnd of London in the fortieth week of the year 1870, i.e. in the first\r\npart of October; the number of deaths caused by it there was 40, and by\r\nthe end of the year this number had increased to 110.\r\n\r\nOf the English counties, those along the north-east coast were most\r\nseverely attacked; for example, Durham and Northumberland, where the\r\nnumber of deaths caused by the disease was 45·0 and 29·8, respectively,\r\nper 10,000 inhabitants. In the cities of Sunderland and\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, located in these counties, the number of deaths per\r\n10,000 inhabitants in the year 1871 was 86·0 and 54·1 respectively.\r\nThere was a very large number of deaths in London (24·2 per 10,000\r\ninhabitants), and the counties bordering on London (Middlesex and Essex)\r\nalso suffered severely (9·3 and 8·0 respectively); next in order come\r\nthe counties of Monmouthshire and Lancashire with 14·8 and 11·9\r\nrespectively. The high mortality in Lancashire was due only to the city\r\nof Lancaster, where there were no less than 38·8 deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants; in the rest of the county the number of deaths per 10,000\r\ninhabitants was only 6·3.\r\n\r\nIn Scotland and Ireland the number of deaths caused by small-pox was:\r\n\r\n              _All told._            _Per 10,000 inhabitants._\r\n         _Scotland._ _Ireland._        _Scotland._        _Ireland._\r\n    1869          64         20                       0·2       0·04\r\n    1870         114         32                       0·3        0·1\r\n    1871       1,442        665                       4·3        1·2\r\n    1872       2,448      3,248                       7·2        6·2\r\n    1873       1,126        504                       3·3        0·9\r\n    1874       1,246        569                       3·6        1·1\r\n    1875          76        535                       0·2        1·0\r\n\r\nSmall-pox spread very slowly to Scotland and Ireland; whereas in England\r\nthe maximum number of persons died in the year 1871, in Scotland and\r\nIreland the maximum number of deaths occurred in the year 1872.

More detailed information\r\nI was unable to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      _(h) Non-European Countries_\r\n\r\nConstant emigration to America caused the disease to make its appearance\r\nthere, and it gradually spread over the entire continent. The following\r\ntable indicates the number of deaths caused by it in the states of\r\nMichigan and Massachusetts:[296]\r\n\r\n                        _Massachusetts._ _Michigan._\r\n                   1870              131          11\r\n                   1871              294          75\r\n                   1872            1,029         304\r\n                   1873              668          93\r\n                   1874               26          19\r\n\r\nIn New York 109 persons succumbed to small-pox in the year 1869, 293 in\r\n1870, and 805 in 1871.\r\n\r\nThe disease was also conveyed to the West Indies and to Chile.\r\nLersch,[302] moreover, reports that severe epidemics of small-pox\r\noccurred in the Sandwich Islands and in Borneo, and that 500,000 persons\r\nsuccumbed to it in the years 1873–5 in British India. But inasmuch as\r\nsmall-pox frequently breaks out there in the form of large epidemics, it\r\ncannot be assumed that the epidemic in Europe exerted any influence upon\r\nthis outbreak.\r\n\r\n\r\n    6. _The Age of the Small-pox Patients. The Connexion between the\r\n       Epidemic and the War. The German Imperial Vaccination Law_\r\n\r\nThus far very little attention has been called to the fact that the age\r\nof the persons who succumbed to small-pox varied greatly in the\r\ndifferent countries. This depends upon how well vaccinated the\r\npopulation of the country or countries was. Formerly, when nobody was\r\never vaccinated, the first year of life and the following years were by\r\nfar the most seriously threatened; after the first few years the\r\nmortality of small-pox gradually decreased as the age of the patients\r\nincreased. This also applies to-day to those countries in which\r\nvaccination is neglected. On the other hand, in those countries in which\r\nchildren are vaccinated in the first year of their lives, the infant\r\nmortality is low, although the same children lose their immunity to the\r\ndisease when they grow older. To illuminate these facts let us adduce a\r\nfew figures. In estimating the number of deaths, however, we cannot use\r\nthe number of the living as a relative basis to work on, since the\r\nprevalence of small-pox varied greatly in the different countries;\r\nconsequently we must take the total number of deaths and estimate the\r\nmortality on the basis of age from that alone. But in doing this we can\r\ncompare with one another only entire countries in which the various ages\r\nare all about equally represented; if we were to take smaller units, for\r\nexample, city and country, or agrarian and industrial districts, and use\r\nthem for a basis of comparison, more detailed computations would be\r\nnecessary. Of the four states included in the table below, Bavaria and\r\nHesse introduced compulsory vaccination (the law required everybody to\r\nbe vaccinated at least once) in the year 1807; Saxony and the\r\nNetherlands, on the other hand, did not have compulsory vaccination. Of\r\nevery 100 persons who died of small-pox the following table indicates\r\nthe relative proportion on the basis of age:\r\n\r\n                                                  _Vaccination not\r\n                   _Vaccination compulsory._        compulsory._\r\n                    _Bavaria._    _Hesse._    _Saxony._   _Netherlands._\r\n                    (1870–5).    (1870–2).     (1872).      (1870–3).\r\n 0–20 years old            22·4         21·8         76·3           68·3\r\n 20–60 years old           59·0         65·4         21·9           29·6\r\n Over 60 years old         18·6         12·8          1·8            2·1\r\n\r\nThis table clearly shows that vaccination protects a person against\r\ncontracting small-pox for a number of years, or at least against\r\nsuccumbing to it, but that this immunity lasts only for a certain length\r\nof time and should be prolonged by revaccination—a fact which the\r\nPrussian military authorities recognized and took into practical\r\nconsideration for many decades prior to the year 1870.\r\n\r\nMany have contended that the epidemic of small-pox which ravaged a large\r\npart of Europe, from the year 1870 on, was not a consequence of the\r\nFranco-German War, but an independent outcome of unknown conditions that\r\nwere particularly favourable to the dissemination of the disease. The\r\nmain argument used to uphold this contention is that epidemics of\r\nsmall-pox had occurred in all the states in the years before the war,\r\nwithout having gained such irresistible headway, and that the disease\r\nhad broken out in the form of epidemics in many parts of Germany and the\r\nneighbouring countries even in the first half of the year 1870. But to\r\nrefute this argument it can be clearly shown through Guttstadt’s\r\ninstructive compilation of data that the German epidemic was in\r\ncountless instances, in the case of Prussia as well as in that of other\r\nstates in the German Confederation, brought about by the transplantation\r\nof the disease from France. Whenever small-pox broke out anywhere in\r\ntimes of peace, it was possible to keep the disease localized, through\r\nisolation of patients and the vaccination of the inhabitants of all\r\nregions in which fugitives from pestilence took refuge. In the year\r\n1870, on the other hand, the contagion of small-pox was spread\r\nthroughout all Germany in a few months; the increased intercourse caused\r\nby the war, together with the habit the Germans had of visiting the\r\nprisons where the French soldiers were confined, also helped to spread\r\nthe disease in all directions.\r\n\r\nFor Germany this disastrous epidemic, which throughout the German\r\nEmpire, including the Imperial Provinces, carried away upwards of\r\n170,000 persons, had just one good result—it led to the passing of a law\r\nin the year 1874 which rendered vaccination compulsory. ‘Besides taking\r\nthousands of human lives the epidemic also caused considerable economic\r\nloss; the care of the sick and the measures adopted to prevent the\r\ndisease from spreading necessitated large expenditures of money, while\r\nlarge numbers of working-men contracted the disease and were thus\r\nincapacitated for a long time; furthermore, the disease left unnumerable\r\nsickly people, who had to be further supported, and at the same time the\r\nfear of infection interfered with commercial intercourse. Those who\r\nmanaged to escape infection, or to recover from an attack of the\r\ndisease, naturally wished to run no more risks in the future, or to\r\nexpose the welfare of their families to danger or destruction.’[303]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all this grave suffering, the representatives of the\r\npeople petitioned the Imperial Government to provide as soon as possible\r\nfor a uniform legislative regulation, making universal vaccination\r\ncompulsory. The desire expressed in this petition was soon fulfilled by\r\nthe submission of a bill on February 5, 1874; the bill was passed by the\r\nReichstag on March 14, and received the signature of the Kaiser on April\r\n8, 1874. This law required all persons to be vaccinated in the first\r\nyear of their lives, and to be revaccinated in their twelfth year; it\r\napplied generally to all Germany.\r\n\r\nThe beneficial result of the passing of this law was clearly\r\ndemonstrated in the course of the following decades. Notwithstanding the\r\nfact that Germany is almost entirely surrounded by states in which\r\nepidemics of small-pox, in consequence of insufficient vaccination, are\r\nof frequent occurrence, since the passing of the Imperial Vaccination\r\nLaw the disease has not once made its appearance on German soil in the\r\nform of a widespread epidemic. Despite the fact that small-pox is\r\nfrequently conveyed into the country, especially by foreign working-men,\r\nthe efforts to keep it confined within narrow limits have always been\r\nsuccessful. The measures which are so effective in the case of other\r\ndiseases—isolation of the patients and of suspected persons living in\r\nthe vicinity, disinfection of the room and effects which have been used\r\nby patients—in an insufficiently vaccinated community do not have the\r\ndesired rapid success, since the contagion of small-pox clings with\r\nextraordinary tenacity to clothes and articles of general use. This fact\r\nhas been abundantly proved in the epidemics of small-pox that have\r\noccurred in Europe in the course of the last few decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n             FROM THE FRANCO-GERMAN WAR TO THE PRESENT TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the great advances made in the last few decades of the nineteenth\r\ncentury must be included the successful battle of modern hygiene against\r\ninfectious diseases. This struggle was introduced by the development of\r\npractical hygiene in England and by the perfection of scientific hygiene\r\nthrough the work of Pettenkofer. But a firm basis on which to combat\r\npestilence was not secured until the brilliant discoveries of Koch and\r\nhis successors pointed out to us the cause of these pestilences, and\r\nmethods were found to demonstrate in a short time the presence of\r\ndisease-germs, even among persons who become ill but slightly, or not at\r\nall, and who for that reason are very dangerous to those about them.\r\n\r\nSince even in time of peace the close quarters in which soldiers live in\r\nbarracks greatly favour the outbreak of epidemics, the military\r\nauthorities constantly watched and profited by these advances in the\r\nfield of disease-prevention; and with the success of efforts to decrease\r\nthe prevalence of infectious diseases among the soldiers in time of\r\npeace, so also in war-times it became possible to check more thoroughly\r\nthan ever before the dissemination of these diseases. Hence the number\r\nof men carried away by epidemics is much smaller in modern wars than\r\nused to be the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n                1. THE RUSSO-TURKISH WAR OF 1877–8[304]\r\n\r\nThe Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8, like all former wars with Turkey, was\r\ncharacterized by severe pestilences, which at both seats of the war, the\r\nEuropean as well as the Asiatic, were responsible for large numbers of\r\ndeaths. Typhus fever, which frequently made its appearance in Russia and\r\nin the Balkan Peninsula, was once more the disease which made the\r\ngreatest havoc. In the years preceding the war it had raged in the form\r\nof epidemics in several Russian Governments, and it is probable that the\r\nRussian army was already infected with it. Erisman states that cases of\r\ntyphus fever were observed among the soldiers in the thirty-fifth\r\ninfantry division when it was being assembled in the Government of Kiev;\r\nthe disease also revealed its presence among the troops when they were\r\nmustered at Kishinev (Bessarabia) before the war broke out. In April and\r\nMay 1877, when the army was advancing toward the Danube under a steady\r\ndownpour of rain, the number of sufferers from typhus fever,\r\nintermittent fever, and dysentery increased considerably. During the\r\nsiege of Plevna, which lasted 143 days and terminated in the\r\ncapitulation of the city on December 10, 1877, the prevalence of disease\r\nincreased still more. The march across the Balkan Peninsula in the\r\nwinter of 1877–8 made great demands upon the badly nourished Russian\r\ntroops. The better conditions anticipated in the Balkan lowlands did not\r\nshow themselves; on the contrary, here began, from the standpoint of\r\nsanitation, the most unfortunate part of the campaign, since the\r\nretreating Turks had devastated the entire country. The number of\r\ntyphus-fever patients in the Russian army, which numbered some 411,000\r\nmen, increased to 18,049 in the month of February 1878, and of these\r\n7,522 had spotted fever and 1,540 died. The pestilence continued to rage\r\nwith unbroken severity until May; in June it began to abate. The total\r\nnumber of fever-patients and deaths in the Russian army during its march\r\nto the Danube is indicated by the following table:\r\n\r\n                                 _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                 Typhoid fever        25,088     7,207\r\n                 Gastric fever        38,363     1,615\r\n                 Typhus fever         32,451    10,081\r\n                 Relapsing fever      39,337     4,849\r\n\r\nThe number of men in the army increased from 217,446 in April 1877, to\r\n418,000 in March 1878.\r\n\r\nThe military lazarets played an important and disastrous rôle in the\r\ndissemination of typhus fever, just as they had done in the Napoleonic\r\nWars. ‘The lazaret-system adopted by the Roumanians’, says Niedner,[305]\r\n‘proved utterly inadequate for the Russians. Scarcely a third of the\r\nregular division-hospitals and military hospitals were made mobile, and\r\ntheir number, as well as their equipment, was insufficient. The lazarets\r\nwere supervised by the Hospital Department, and consequently lacked all\r\nmedical management and were always missing wherever they were needed.\r\nThe few available lazarets were overcrowded, and being full of dirt and\r\nrefuse they merely constituted an added danger for the patients and for\r\nthe inhabitants. Not until after long delay were additional barracks\r\nconstructed, and these were so badly arranged that they offered very\r\nlittle relief from the condition of overcrowding in the hospitals. Above\r\nall, there was a lack of means for disinfection and of clean linen, and\r\nthis rendered it inevitable that large quantities of infectious material\r\nshould accumulate in the lazarets, and that convalescents discharged\r\nfrom these hospitals should be more likely to infect other people with\r\nwhom they came in contact along the military roads.’ The transporting of\r\nthese convalescents back to Russia began in the first part of the\r\ncampaign; they not only spread the disease all along the military roads,\r\nbut large numbers of them conveyed it back to Russia itself, where it\r\nappeared in countless localities and soon developed into a widespread\r\nepidemic of typhus fever. At the end of the campaign, to be sure,\r\nconditions improved; in the spring of the year 1878 a commission\r\nappointed for the purpose finally succeeded in establishing certain\r\nrules governing sanitation in the lazarets, and in bringing it about\r\nthat typhus fever patients were everywhere isolated. When the war was\r\nover the troops were transported back home across the Black Sea, along\r\nthe coast of which, in the ports of Réni, Nikolayev, Sebastopol, and\r\nOdessa, health-committees had been appointed to see to it that the sick\r\nsoldiers were congregated by themselves.\r\n\r\nTyphoid and typhus fever likewise became very widespread in the\r\nCaucasian army. According to Kosloff, typhus fever was not endemic in\r\nArmenia, as was probably the case with typhoid fever; the Russian\r\nphysicians think that it was conveyed thither by the Russians themselves\r\nand not by the Turks. The conditions for quartering the Russian troops\r\nwere as unfavourable as one could possibly imagine; they were housed in\r\ndirty Armenian villages, where nobody attended to the removal of refuse,\r\nand were badly provisioned and inadequately supplied with clothing;\r\nthis, coupled with continuous marching and fighting, greatly reduced\r\ntheir power of resistance. In October 1877 the main army was infected\r\nwith typhus fever, and the overcrowded hospitals merely helped to spread\r\nthe disease. Conditions were worst of all in the detachment in Erivan.\r\nAfter the troops had gone into winter quarters there, typhus fever broke\r\nout with terrible severity and presently the entire government of Erivan\r\nwas suffering from the pestilence; particularly hard hit were the cities\r\nof Erivan, Chorassan, &c., where the troops were very numerous and were\r\nexposed to the ravages of the pestilence. The following table indicates\r\nthe number of men in the Caucasian army that contracted and succumbed to\r\nthe four diseases mentioned:\r\n\r\n                                 _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n                 Typhoid fever        24,473     8,908\r\n                 Gastric fever         9,589     1,044\r\n                 Typhus fever         15,660     6,506\r\n                 Relapsing fever      14,576     3,775\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of those regions in Asia in which fighting took place\r\nwere not attacked by typhus fever. The Turkish troops, on the other\r\nhand, suffered severely from the disease, though not so severely as the\r\nRussian troops; the reason for this was that the former were better\r\nnourished and their camps were kept clean. The Turkish prisoners fared\r\nno better than the Russian prisoners; of 57,000 prisoners taken, 13,983\r\nsuccumbed to various fevers, most of them to typhus fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      2. THE BOER WAR OF 1899–1901\r\n\r\nIn the war which England waged against the free states, Orange and\r\nTransvaal, and which lasted more than two years and necessitated the\r\ntransportation, on the part of England, of more than 400,000 soldiers to\r\nSouth Africa, infectious diseases, particularly typhoid fever, played a\r\nvery important rôle. The English army, which averaged 200,000 men,\r\nsustained the following losses:[306]\r\n\r\n                           _Died of     _Died in battle\r\n                          diseases._    and of wounds._    _Total._\r\n From Feb. 10, 1900, to\r\n   the end of that year           7,009           4,088          11,097\r\n In the year 1901                 4,318           2,337           6,655\r\n                                 ——————           —————          ——————\r\n         Total                   11,327           6,425          17,752\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever had always been prevalent in South Africa; the first cases\r\nin the English army were observed during the hurried march to\r\nBloemfontein along the Modder River, on which the soldiers were\r\ndependent for drinking-water, despite the fact that typhoid fever was\r\nknown to be raging in places further upstream. The Berkefeld and Pasteur\r\nfilters yielded too little water, for the reason that they soon became\r\nclogged; the soldiers used boiled water with reluctance, for the reason\r\nthat it took so long for it to cool. Another source of infection besides\r\nthe water was the fine dust that was stirred up by daily wind-storms;\r\nthis dust, being full of disease-germs, contributed greatly to the\r\ndissemination of typhoid fever. Furthermore, the crowding together of\r\nsoldiers in tents caused many of them to contract the disease by direct\r\ncommunication.[307]\r\n\r\nJameson, the chief of the army’s medical staff, lamented the fact that\r\nsanitary officers (hygienists), originally appointed to accompany each\r\ndivision of troops, were dismissed. The regular doctors, who were then\r\ncalled upon to perform their functions, were fully occupied with taking\r\ncare of the wounded, and were probably not well informed as to hygienic\r\ninvestigations and measures. The results obtained from preventive\r\ninoculation, which was practised on some of the soldiers, were in\r\ngeneral satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn other places the conditions were similar to those along the Modder\r\nRiver; in Paardeberg the available drinking-water was equally bad, and\r\nin Bloemfontein there was an explosion-like outbreak of fever. From the\r\nbeginning of the campaign to the middle of the year 1900 there were\r\n13,057 cases of disease in the army, and of those 3,174 terminated\r\nfatally; the total number of cases during the entire war was no less\r\nthan 42,741.\r\n\r\nThe English troops that were shut up in Ladysmith from November 1, 1899,\r\nto February 27, 1900, were very severely attacked by typhoid fever. In\r\nthe first part of November the English garrison had consisted of 13,496\r\nmen, and by March it had dwindled down to 10,164 men. The number of sick\r\nsoldiers committed to the lazaret amounted to no less than 10,668, and\r\nof these 1,766 had typhoid fever and 1,857 had dysentery; 383 of the\r\nformer and 117 of the latter died. When the Boers withdrew there were\r\n1,996 patients in the hospital, 708 of them suffering from typhoid\r\nfever, 341 from dysentery, and 189 from wounds.[308]\r\n\r\nIn the Concentration Camps which the English established in the summer\r\nof the year 1900 for the accommodation of the women and children in the\r\nSouth African Republics, the pestilences soon gained the upper hand.\r\nLord Roberts had made arrangements to concentrate the families of the\r\nBoers in camps; since the farms of the Boers were systematically burned,\r\nthese camps were supposed to protect their wives and children against\r\nstarvation, and at the same time the wives and children served as\r\nhostages for their husbands and fathers. When the location of these\r\ncamps was decided upon, not sanitary, but military considerations were\r\ntaken into account; it was necessary that they should be controlled from\r\na near-by fortress. They soon became overcrowded, the supply of water\r\nwas inadequate, and there was much uncleanliness. The inhabitants of the\r\ncamps were mostly women, children, and old men; thus, for example, in\r\nOctober 1901, of the people living in the camps in the Orange Free\r\nState, 55 per cent were children under fifteen years of age, 31.9 per\r\ncent were women, and 13.1 per cent were men, mostly old men. According\r\nto the reports submitted to Parliament the condition of health in the\r\nConcentration Camps in Natal and in the Cape Colony was not\r\nunfavourable, but in those in Transvaal and Orange it was very bad. The\r\nfollowing statistics, covering the time between June and September 1901,\r\nrelate to the Concentration Camps in the Transvaal:[309]\r\n\r\n                                 NUMBER OF INHABITANTS.\r\n    _Month._       _Men._       _Women._     _Children._     _Total._\r\n June                   8,576        16,078        19,811         44,465\r\n July                   9,665        20,012        24,462         54,139\r\n August                10,496        22,036        25,983         58,515\r\n September             10,581        22,226        26,599         59,406\r\n                                                                  ——————\r\n    Average                                                       54,131\r\n\r\n                                 NUMBER OF DEATHS.\r\n  _Month._    _Men._     _Women._   _Children._  _Total._     _Annual\r\n                                                            death-rate._\r\n June                26          48         310         384        103·6\r\n July                51         118         748         917        203·2\r\n August              32         185       1,014       1,231        252·5\r\n September           75         165       1,014       1,254        253·3\r\n                                                                   —————\r\n  Average                                                          209·8\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Orange Free State the following statistics, including\r\nthe month of October, were compiled:\r\n\r\n                                 NUMBER OF INHABITANTS.\r\n    _Month._       _Men._       _Women._     _Children._     _Total._\r\n June                   5,116         9,646        17,953         32,715\r\n July                   5,351        11,213        20,132         36,696\r\n August                 5,826        13,381        24,415         43,622\r\n September              6,089        14,140        25,118         45,347\r\n October                5,906        14,471        24,929         45,306\r\n                                                                  ——————\r\n    Average                                                       40,737\r\n\r\n                                 NUMBER OF DEATHS.\r\n  _Month._    _Men._     _Women._   _Children._  _Total._     _Annual\r\n                                                            death-rate._\r\n June                32          75         182         289        106·0\r\n July                50          69         369         488        159·5\r\n August              30          82         510         622        171·1\r\n September           43         153         885       1,081        286·0\r\n October             58         133       1,329       1,520        402·6\r\n                                                                   —————\r\n  Average                                                          235·6\r\n\r\nAll told, no less than 19,600 persons (14,894 children and 4,706 adults)\r\ndied in the Concentration Camps up to March 1902; that is, about\r\none-fifth of the total number of inhabitants died in a period of about\r\nfifteen months. As indicated by the above tables, the children suffered\r\nmore severely than the adults. The principal causes of the high\r\nmortality among the children were measles and pneumonia; since the\r\ngrownup Boers had never experienced an attack of measles in their\r\nchildhood, they too, even the very old men, contracted the disease and\r\nmany of them succumbed to it. The prevalence of pneumonia can be\r\nexplained on the ground that the temperature fluctuated greatly in the\r\ncourse of the winter, and the nights, in particular, were extremely\r\ncold. Whooping-cough, varicella, mumps, and diphtheria were prevalent in\r\nall the camps, and typhoid fever, which, as remarked above, is endemic\r\nin many parts of South Africa, was very common; so also were diarrhoea\r\nand dysentery.\r\n\r\nThe chief cause of the high mortality in the prison-camps was the fact\r\nthat such large numbers of men, men whose vitality had been reduced by\r\nprivations and hardships, were congregated in places which had not been\r\nproperly prepared to receive them. The unfortunate prisoners often\r\nreached the place of detention in a pitiable condition—exhausted and\r\nhalf naked. Furthermore, they were men who had no appreciation of the\r\norder that must be observed, when large numbers of people are\r\ncongregated in one place, in attending to the daily requirements of\r\nnature, nor were they willing to be taught. The result was that the\r\nground became filthy; the open spaces in front of the tents were often\r\nused in place of the latrines; the contents of slop-jars were simply\r\nthrown out in front of the doors, instead of being emptied into\r\nreceptacles that were deposited here and there for that purpose. The\r\nmothers had no idea of nursing, and were unwilling to take medical\r\nadvice; in order to avoid having to send their children to the hospital,\r\nthey kept secret the fact that they were sick, thus giving measles,\r\ndiphtheria, &c., the best possible chance to spread. We read in an\r\nEnglish report:[310]\r\n\r\n\r\n  A large share of the high death-rate in them is ascribable to the\r\n  condition in which the women and children arrive. Often they have\r\n  been half-starved and are broken down in health. It cannot be\r\n  wondered at that under these circumstances measles and other\r\n  diseases are inordinately fatal. The dirty personal habits of the\r\n  Boers, their use of improper and often disgusting remedies, and\r\n  their ignorant errors of dietetics in regard to young children, have\r\n  rendered it extremely difficult to secure favourable results in the\r\n  treatment of cases of sickness among the Boer children. There\r\n  appears to be no doubt, as indicated in our previous special\r\n  article, that the measles which has been prevalent has been of a\r\n  specially malignant type. Its malignancy has doubtless been\r\n  intensified by the dirty condition of the Boer children, and by the\r\n  overcrowding that has been permitted in the camps, as well as by the\r\n  previous bad health of these children. The present reports afford\r\n  abundant evidence confirmatory of the conclusion at which we had\r\n  previously arrived, that dysentery, diarrhoea, and enteric fever in\r\n  a large proportion of the camps have been prevalent as well as\r\n  measles.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in another report we read:[311]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Measles of a particularly malignant type has prevailed. Its fatality\r\n  has doubtless been increased by the exhausted and semi-starved\r\n  condition in which many of the Boers and their children have arrived\r\n  at the camps. It has been impossible to isolate such cases in the\r\n  camps; and the crude and ignorant and even mischievous methods of\r\n  domestic treatment adopted by the Boer women have doubtless\r\n  increased the evil, as have also the personal uncleanliness of the\r\n  Boers and their fear of fresh air as well as of clean water. But, as\r\n  previously pointed out, enteric fever and diarrhoea and dysentery\r\n  have claimed a large toll of victims, and for the excessive amount\r\n  of these the deficient sanitary control of the camps must be held in\r\n  a large measure responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the arrival of the better season, when the Concentration Camps,\r\nunder the pressure of public opinion, were thoroughly cleansed, the\r\ncondition of health improved. Hönigsberger,[312] who inspected the camp\r\nat Merebank (in Natal) in May 1912, derived a very favourable\r\nimpression; notwithstanding the fact that the camp lay on low ground\r\nnear the sea-coast, where the soil was necessarily damp, there was no\r\nvisible surface water because of an effective system of drainage. The\r\ndrinking-water facilities were good. Of some 8,000 refugees sheltered\r\nthere only 110 died between the months of February and May 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n             3. THE WAR IN SOUTH-WEST AFRICA (1904–7)[313]\r\n\r\nIn the very first year of the war, typhoid fever broke out with great\r\nseverity. The disease first made its appearance in the war against the\r\nHerero nation in the first part of April 1904; it attacked the eastern\r\ndivision of the army, which was commanded by Major von Glasenapp and\r\nnumbered twenty-five officers and 509 men, in Onjatu (midway between\r\nWindhuk and Waterberg), after the soldiers had been exposed to rainy\r\nweather, cold nights, and extreme hardship. On April 6 there were six\r\ncases of the disease reported, and by April 16 the number of cases had\r\nincreased to sixty-six; the division was then transferred to\r\nOtjihaenena, where the patients were housed in permanent lazarets and\r\nthe healthy men were quarantined. Throughout the remaining part of the\r\nwar, typhoid fever played an important rôle; the total number of deaths\r\nin the years 1904–7 was 1,491; of these 689 succumbed to diseases, 439\r\nof them to typhoid fever. The soldiers who fought in the battles against\r\nthe Hereros were most severely attacked; of a total of 470 deaths 283\r\nwere caused by typhoid fever and only twenty-two by other diseases. In\r\nthe three years’ struggle against the Hottentots some 1,200 soldiers\r\ndied; 375 of them died of diseases; of the 375 typhoid fever was\r\nresponsible for 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  4. THE RUSSO-JAPANESE WAR OF 1904–5\r\n\r\nThe apprehension that the Russo-Japanese War would be accompanied by\r\nsevere outbreaks of infectious diseases turned out to be groundless. The\r\nchief danger that threatened both armies was typhoid fever, which is\r\nendemic in Manchuria, and which, on account of the filthy condition of\r\nthe Chinese villages, was given an excellent opportunity to spread. In\r\nthe first place, the soldiers were prevented from being infected by the\r\nfact that they were allowed to drink nothing but boiled water, and were\r\nalways supplied with hot water for tea; in the second place, when they\r\nwere called upon to remain in one place for a considerable length of\r\ntime, they were quartered, not in the Chinese villages, but in\r\nearth-huts; or, if they were compelled to live in the Chinese villages,\r\nthese were always thoroughly disinfected beforehand. Whenever it was\r\npossible, the Japanese military physicians, before the troops arrived in\r\na village, investigated the place with reference to hygienic conditions\r\nand subjected the inhabitants to an examination. Notwithstanding all\r\nthis, large numbers of soldiers on both sides, in the course of the war,\r\nwhich lasted twenty-one months, contracted typhoid fever, diarrhoea, and\r\ndysentery. In both summers, which are very hot in Manchuria, typhoid\r\nfever made its appearance, to a greater extent in the second than in the\r\nfirst, since the troops before and after the battle of Mukden remained\r\nencamped for a long time in one and the same place.[314] According to\r\nthe statements of the Russian General Medical Staff,[315] the total\r\nnumber of deaths in the Russian army (excluding the troops at Port\r\nArthur and the fleet) caused by diseases was 7,960, and to these must be\r\nadded the deaths among the discharged troops; the total number of men in\r\nthe Russian army was 709,587. Even if these figures are incomplete,\r\nnevertheless they distinctly show that epidemic diseases, considering\r\nthe long duration of the war, were not very prevalent. The reports of\r\nforeigners who accompanied the Russian army agree in pronouncing the\r\ngeneral condition of health excellent.[316] Spotted fever and anthrax\r\nwere also observed, but among both the Russians and the Japanese they\r\nappeared only sporadically. According to Follenfant,[317] 56,717 cases\r\nof infectious diseases occurred among the Russians; of these 25,800 were\r\nenterorrhoea, 15,800 were typhoid fever, 8,970 were dysentery, and 4,500\r\nwere malaria. Regarding the prevalence of disease in Port Arthur we\r\nshall have more to say in the tenth chapter.\r\n\r\nConditions among the Japanese were less favourable, since, on account of\r\ntheir rapid advance, sanitary measures could not be carried out as\r\nextensively as was desirable. The total number of men in the Japanese\r\narmy carried away by diseases was no less than 21,802; 3,956 succumbed\r\nto beri-beri, 4,073 to typhoid fever, 1,804 to dysentery, and 11 to\r\ntyphus fever.[318] All told, 95,572 cases of beri-beri were observed; at\r\nfirst the disease was very common, but later on, when barley was added\r\nto the rice, its prevalence decreased. The number of Japanese soldiers\r\nkilled in battle was very large (47,387), and to these must be added\r\n10,970 who died of wounds.\r\n\r\nAs to whether or not the war caused typhoid fever and dysentery to\r\nspread among the civil inhabitants of Manchuria, as was probably the\r\ncase, we have no specific information; the appearance of other diseases\r\namong the civil inhabitants is improbable, since the troops would\r\ncertainly have contracted them had they been prevalent.\r\n\r\nNo information has been given by either Russia or Japan as to whether\r\nthe soldiers brought diseases back home with them. In Japan, according\r\nto the _Year Book of Statistics_,[319] the number of deaths was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n          _Typhoid._ _Typhus._ _Cholera._ _Dysentery._ _Beri-beri._\r\n     1903      4,585         9        140        7,172       10,783\r\n     1904      5,100         5         51        5,294        9,408\r\n     1905      6,291        10         34        8,763       11,703\r\n     1906      6,338         5         29        5,173        7,766\r\n     1907      5,974         6      1,702        5,872        8,767\r\n     1908      5,824         9        297        8,053       10,786\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the transplantation of infectious diseases into\r\nJapan, very comprehensive measures of precaution were adopted by the\r\nJapanese military authorities, as was the case after the war with China.\r\nInfected soldiers, and soldiers suspected of being infected, were not\r\nallowed to join the transports; in order to find them out, three\r\nquarantine stations were established, one in Dairei (near Moji), a\r\nsecond in Ninoshima (near Ujina), and a third at Wadano Misaki (near\r\nKobe). When the transports of troops reached their destination, the men\r\nwere divided into groups of 60 and sent to disinfection establishments,\r\nwhere they were bathed and their effects were disinfected. The sick were\r\ncommitted to the hospital, and suspicious cases were quartered in\r\nbarracks under observation. If infected men had been found on a ship,\r\nthe entire ship, crew, and officers, were disinfected. The disinfection\r\nestablishments received 828,376 men for examination; of these 429,962\r\nwere disinfected.[320]\r\n\r\n\r\n          5. THE OCCUPATION OF TRIPOLI BY THE ITALIANS (1911)\r\n\r\nDuring the battles fought in connexion with the occupation of Tripoli by\r\nthe Italians, infectious diseases were confined within narrow limits.\r\nAccording to Sforza, the army physician in Tripoli,[321] cholera broke\r\nout there in the second half of October 1911, reached its climax in\r\nNovember, and disappeared entirely in the second half of December. The\r\ndisease was spread chiefly by dates, which had been infected by flies;\r\nit first appeared among the native beggars, then spread to the rest of\r\nthe population, and finally to the Italian soldiers. The pestilence\r\nraged only in Tripoli, a fact which Sforza regards as a proof that it\r\nwas not conveyed thither by the Italians; for had this been the case,\r\ncholera would have revealed its presence in Homs, Bengasi, Derna, and\r\nTobruk, in which places thousands of soldiers disembarked, but not a\r\nsingle case of the disease was observed. Typhus fever is endemic in\r\nTripoli; after the Italian occupation twenty cases of that disease were\r\nobserved among the natives and ten cases among the soldiers. In order to\r\nprevent diseases from spreading to Italy, convalescents were not allowed\r\nto return home until there was absolutely no danger of their\r\ncommunicating the infection to other persons. The same measures of\r\nprecaution were used in relation to relapsing fever.\r\n\r\n\r\n     6. THE WAR BETWEEN TURKEY AND THE BALKAN STATES (1912–13)[322]\r\n\r\nRegarding the Balkan war definite information is still wanting. Well\r\nknown, however, is the outbreak of cholera along the Tchatalja lines;\r\nbut the progress of the disease was soon checked and it did not become\r\nvery widespread. It first appeared in the camp of the Turks, whither it\r\nwas borne by troops from Asia, where severe epidemics of it had occurred\r\nin Mecca and Tiberias, and where it had made its appearance in several\r\nother places. In Constantinople the first case of the disease was\r\nreported on November 5, 1912; in the first week of December it had\r\nreached its climax, and after January 20 only sporadic cases were\r\nobserved. The following table indicates the number of persons who\r\ncontracted and succumbed to cholera in Constantinople:\r\n\r\n                                      _Patients._ _Deaths._\r\n            Nov.  5–Dec.  2 (1912)            934       441\r\n            Dec.  3–Dec.  9 (1912)            540       229\r\n            Dec. 10–Dec. 16 (1912)            451       244\r\n            Dec. 17–Dec. 23 (1912)            276       158\r\n            Dec. 24–Dec. 30 (1912)            141        74\r\n            Dec. 31–Feb.  1 (1913)            173        99\r\n                                            —————     —————\r\n            Nov. 5, 1912–Feb. 1, 1913       2,515     1,245\r\n\r\nAmong the Bulgarians cholera did not become very widespread; throughout\r\nthe entire territory occupied by the Bulgarians, cases of cholera, to be\r\nsure, were observed, particularly along the Tchatalja lines. But the\r\nBulgarians fought the pestilence with energetic measures; the troops\r\nwere given nothing but boiled water, and careful attention was paid to\r\nwhat they ate; the railway dépôts were thoroughly disinfected, as were\r\nall places in which large numbers of people congregated. During the\r\narmistice the Bulgarians were forbidden all intercourse with the Turks.\r\nFor the troops transported back home quarantine stations were\r\nestablished. The result of all these precautionary measures was\r\neminently successful. In Bulgaria itself only sporadic outbreaks of\r\ncholera occurred, as in Sofia, Stara Zagara, and in the district of\r\nShumla;[323] on January 18, 1913, Bulgaria was entirely free from\r\ncholera.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever broke out very frequently in all the armies, but detailed\r\ninformation regarding its prevalence has not been published. According\r\nto the reports which have thus far been issued, the disease did not\r\nappear in the form of epidemics in any of the armies; on the other hand,\r\nit is stated that it broke out among the Turkish prisoners in Bulgaria\r\nand Servia, as in Tatar-Bazarjik, Ligotin, Zajecar, and Kujazevas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                   EPIDEMICS IN BESIEGED STRONGHOLDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen fortified cities are subjected to a long siege the death-rate in\r\nthem increases considerably; if diseases break out during the siege,\r\nthey spread beyond expectation and carry away large numbers of people.\r\nThe greatest enemy of the people in a besieged city is hunger. Since the\r\napproaching hostile army causes the inhabitants of the surrounding\r\ncountry to take refuge in the cities, the latter suddenly become\r\novercrowded, moreover with people who are generally quite penniless and\r\nhave to be provided for by the rest. In former years, when warfare was\r\nmuch more cruel than it is to-day, this was especially the case.\r\nFurthermore, the size of the garrison must be rapidly increased, or\r\nperhaps the whole of a retreating army, as was the case in Metz, must be\r\nquartered in the stronghold. Accordingly, the first step taken by the\r\ncommander of a fortress must be to ascertain the quantity of provisions\r\non hand, and to work out an appropriate plan for the distribution of\r\nthem. How the quality of the bread becomes more and more unsatisfactory,\r\nand finally reaches the point where the product is scarcely worthy of\r\nthe name bread; how people are obliged to eat the flesh of horses, dogs,\r\nand other animals; how the prices of the necessaries of life soar _ad\r\ninfinitum_—all this is so well known that it needs no further\r\nexposition. Besides the absence of these necessaries of life, the lack\r\nof milk, fats, salt, and vegetables is accompanied by various\r\nconsequences; very frequently improper and badly prepared food gives\r\nrise to a large number of severe cases of intestinal catarrh.\r\n\r\nInsufficient nourishment is seldom the direct cause of death; on the\r\nother hand, it frequently so weakens people that they are much more\r\nsubject to sickness, or, if they have already contracted some disease,\r\nthey are much more likely to die, or, if they recover, to convalesce\r\nslowly. Thus Vacher[324] states that typhoid fever, which usually\r\nresults fatally in one out of four cases, during the siege of Paris\r\ncarried away no less than forty per cent of those who contracted it;\r\ntuberculosis, he says, often acquired an acute form and caused death\r\nwithin a few weeks. Little children present slight resistance to famine.\r\n‘In regard to new-born and one-year-old infants I have observed in\r\ncertain cases that become more frequent every day, that the effects of\r\ninsufficient alimentation show themselves in the form of a progressive\r\nemaciation, which includes all the tissues of the body and almost always\r\nhas fatal consequences; oedema of the teguments, anaemia, uncontrollable\r\ndiarrhoea, and continual plaintive crying on the part of the little\r\npatients are the characteristic symptoms of that hunger-fever which\r\nactually decimates our infant generation.’\r\n\r\nAnother result of insufficient nourishment, one which has frequently\r\nbeen observed in besieged strongholds, is the appearance of scurvy.\r\n\r\nDuring sieges, the hygienic measures of precaution, which are absolutely\r\nessential to the maintenance of health in cities, can no longer be\r\ncarried out. If spring-water is secured outside the city for the\r\ninhabitants, the besiegers cut off the source of supply; if the water of\r\nrivers is used, then filtration plants have to be erected. But even\r\nfiltration does not prevent the appearance of those infectious diseases\r\nthe germs of which are carried in water, since for washing purposes the\r\nriver-water is used just as it is found. The removal of refuse\r\nconstitutes an extremely difficult problem; the cleaning out of privies\r\nis often possible only to a very insufficient extent, especially when\r\nthe besiegers have advanced very close to the city, and the failure to\r\ndispose of garbage necessarily causes large accumulations of dirt and\r\nfilth in the streets; this was especially the case in former times.\r\n\r\nThe burying of so many dead bodies, of both men and animals, especially\r\nhorses, has met in many sieges with serious obstacles;[325] if the\r\nditches intended for a large number of bodies are not dug deep enough,\r\nthe atmosphere becomes polluted; to burn them is impossible, owing to\r\nlack of fuel; and if they are cast into the river, this jeopardizes the\r\nhealth of those living further downstream. During certain sieges in the\r\npast, hard conditions have made it necessary to leave corpses and\r\ncarcases lying in the open, with terrible consequences.\r\n\r\nIf the siege takes place in the winter, it is very difficult to procure\r\nfuel for heating purposes, unless sufficient provision has been made\r\nbeforehand. In Paris, for example, the inhabitants suffered severely\r\nfrom cold, and to meet the emergency artificial fuel was prepared by\r\nmixing stable manure with tar and reducing the mass to solid form under\r\nthe hydraulic press.\r\n\r\nIn the following pages we discuss a few sieges which were characterized\r\nby severe outbreaks of pestilence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  1. THE SIEGE OF MANTUA (1796–7)[326]\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Mantua, which the French carried on from May 30,\r\n1796, to February 3, 1797, war-pestilences raged with fearful severity\r\namong both besiegers and besieged. The city lay in an extremely\r\nunhealthy region—malaria was ever prevalent and the drinking-water was\r\nbad. The intentional flooding of the region and the great heat of the\r\nsummer of 1796 caused malaria to break out with great severity and to\r\nacquire virulent forms that rendered the disease more dangerous than\r\nusual. In the latter part of May 1796, the garrison consisted of 18,000\r\nAustrian troops, whose power of resistance had been greatly reduced by\r\nhard service from November on, and by exposure to rain and cold with\r\ninadequate means of shelter. Besides intermittent fever, both intestinal\r\ncatarrh and typhus fever made their appearance in July; the latter, at\r\nleast, was probably the ‘nervous fever’ mentioned by Stegmeyer. Thus as\r\nearly as the latter part of July there were some 2,000 sick men in the\r\ngarrison. In August the investment was not yet complete, so that the\r\nsoldiers did not suffer from lack of food. Notwithstanding this fact,\r\nhowever, the diseases increased in prevalence and caused many deaths;\r\nthe number of sick men was no less than 6,000. On September 12 the\r\nAustrian general, Würmser, with about 12,000 men, succeeded in gaining\r\nentrance into the city; he brought with him a large number of disabled\r\nmen who had been wounded in recent fighting, and many of whom succumbed\r\nto tetanus and hospital fever. The number of patients now increased to\r\n8,500; as there was no bedding or straw available, the patients were\r\ncompelled to lie on the bare ground, and the uncleanliness of the\r\nhospitals grew worse. When the investment was finally rendered complete\r\nin October, it caused a great scarcity of meat, fat, and wine; the\r\nnumber of patients that month was 9,000 and the number of deaths 2,560.\r\nThese figures, however, are not complete, since they do not include the\r\npatients in the houses set aside for troops overcome by exhaustion. Up\r\nto this time the weather had been good, but in November rain set in; and\r\nwhile intermittent fever then decreased in prevalence, dysentery raged\r\neven more furiously, and typhus fever also broke out in a virulent,\r\nquickly fatal form. The supply of food now ran very low, and although\r\nthere was sufficient bread on hand, horse-flesh was the only meat. To\r\nadd to the general misery, scurvy made its appearance in November, and\r\nall those who contracted it died. The extreme cold compelled the\r\npatients to keep their clothes on, and they lay without blankets on the\r\nhard floors of the hospital corridors; their number had now increased to\r\n9,500, and 2,400 died in November. In December the misery increased; the\r\ncold became more and more intense, the supply of food was almost\r\nexhausted, and the wine gave out altogether; scurvy raged in an even\r\nmore severe and virulent form, being frequently accompanied by copious\r\nhemorrhages from various parts of the body. In the hospitals there were\r\n7,354 patients, and 2,021 died in the month of December. In January the\r\nacme of misery was reached; the scarcity of food was terrible, and the\r\nravages of scurvy were no less than frightful; 1,968 men in the garrison\r\nwere carried away in the course of that month. On February 3, 1797, the\r\nstronghold was surrendered to the French. The number of patients taken\r\nin by the hospitals between September and January exceeded 40,000, and\r\nof the garrison, which numbered some 30,000 men, 10,249 (more than\r\none-third of the total) died. Fodéré estimates the total number of\r\ndeaths in the city of Mantua during the siege at 20,000;[327] regarding\r\nthe prevalence of diseases and the number of deaths among the civil\r\ninhabitants Steegmeyer unfortunately gives us no information.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     2. THE SIEGE OF DANZIG (1813)\r\n\r\nDanzig, which in the spring of 1807 had passed through a siege of ten\r\nweeks, was once more, in the year 1813, from January 11 to November 29,\r\nsubjected to the horrors of a siege, which for two reasons was even more\r\nhorrible than the previous one; in the first place, the garrison was\r\nbadly infected with disease, causing a severe epidemic to rage\r\nthroughout the city; and in the second place, the defenders of the\r\nstronghold, which was most advantageously located to withstand a siege,\r\nwere national enemies of the inhabitants. Consequently the latter were\r\nnot only grossly disregarded in the distribution of supplies, but were\r\nactually obliged to turn over all they had to the French and then buy it\r\nback at exorbitant prices. And while the inhabitants, and toward the end\r\nof the siege the soldiers, too, suffered severely from a lack of the\r\nnecessaries of life, the higher officers and the military officials\r\nlived in luxury until the day of the surrender.\r\n\r\nNapoleon had assigned the defence of the city to General Rapp, who\r\nperformed the task with great valour and ability. On the return march\r\nfrom Russia, some 40,000 men of Macdonald’s corps had congregated in\r\nDanzig, and 5,000 of them were sent away by Rapp; in the middle of\r\nJanuary the total number of men in the garrison, including the military\r\nofficials, was 35,934, consisting of Frenchmen, Poles, Bavarians,\r\nWestphalians, Spaniards, Italians, and Dutchmen. While Macdonald’s corps\r\nhad fared pretty well, comparatively speaking, in the Russian campaign,\r\nthe men were all very much exhausted, and furthermore, typhus fever was\r\nprevalent among them. As early as the latter part of January,\r\naccordingly, the number of sick soldiers was very large; in fact, only\r\nabout 10,000 men were healthy and able to bear arms. ‘As there were no\r\nhospitals, beds, or remedies,’ says Friccius,[328] ‘many died from lack\r\nof care, and at the same time infectious diseases broke out and made\r\ngreat havoc. A heap of dead men and horses was a common sight in the\r\nstreets, and in a short time many thousands of the troops, as well as of\r\nthe inhabitants, were carried away.’\r\n\r\nIn January the death-rate remained comparatively low; of the garrison\r\nabout 400 men died in the course of that month. But in February, which\r\nwas a very cold month, typhus fever spread abroad with great rapidity,\r\nso that toward the end of the month some 130 soldiers died every day; no\r\nless than 15,000 men lay sick, and the total number of deaths for the\r\nentire month amounted to 2,000. When it began to thaw on February 24,\r\nthe number of patients and deaths increased still more, so that 4,000\r\nmen died in March and 3,000 in April. From April on, the condition of\r\nhealth in the garrison improved, although the number of deaths in the\r\nmonth of May was still no less than 2,000.[329]\r\n\r\nAs early as February typhus fever had spread to the civil population,\r\nwhich before the siege had numbered some 40,000; a great many civilians,\r\nhowever, had fled from the city before the investment was yet complete.\r\nIn the months of February and March, according to Blech,[330] some\r\n200–300 persons died every week, ‘including representatives of all\r\nclasses—physicians, preachers, jurists, merchants, down to the humblest\r\npeople.’ The pestilence raged most furiously among the civil inhabitants\r\nin the latter part of March. ‘Almost every family was in mourning, and\r\nmany families were wiped out entirely; the best and most estimable young\r\nmen were carried away in the prime of their lives. Whole families\r\nperished, especially in certain streets which the pestilence seemed to\r\nhave selected for its chief dwelling-place.’[331] These were especially\r\nthe streets inhabited by the poorer classes.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before a lack of the necessaries of life began to make\r\nitself felt in the city. As early as February 27 the Russians had cut\r\noff the supply of water afforded by the Radaune, which fed the wells in\r\nthe city, and this necessitated dependence upon rain-water. For the\r\npurpose of obtaining new supplies of food, a sortie along the Nehrung\r\nwas undertaken on April 27; and while the enterprise was successful, the\r\nonly persons who really derived any benefit from it were the higher\r\nofficers and military officials, who sold butter, milk, and corned beef\r\nat exorbitant prices. Thus the well-to-do citizens, at least, were able\r\nto secure food by paying an excessive price for it. In May the\r\nconditions among the poor became a great deal worse; they were obliged\r\nto eat things that were positively disgusting; horse-meat and waste from\r\nthe breweries were delicacies, while cats and dogs were also devoured.\r\nThe rations of the soldiers grew smaller and smaller, although there was\r\nsufficient grain on hand to keep them supplied with bread. Says\r\nFriccius,[332] in regard to a sortie undertaken on June 9, ‘How hungry\r\nthe troops in the garrison were is indicated by the fact that they cut\r\nup every horse that was killed in battle and took the edible parts with\r\nthem.’\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the armistice, which became known in Danzig on\r\nJune 10, there was a pause in the siege lasting until August 18; during\r\nthis time the besiegers brought food to the garrison every five days,\r\nbut absolutely no provision was made for the civil inhabitants. During\r\nthe armistice many citizens left the city; indeed the French expelled\r\nfrom the city all persons who were not sufficiently provided with the\r\nnecessaries of life. At first the Russians allowed the fugitives to pass\r\nthrough their lines, but later on they raised objections, so that a\r\nlarge number of the unfortunate inhabitants were obliged to live in the\r\nopen fields between the besiegers and the besieged, where many of them\r\ndied of starvation. In the latter part of September General Rapp allowed\r\nsome 300 of them, who had managed to keep alive, to return into the\r\ncity. Blech asserts that the emigration of beggars and others of the\r\npoor reduced the population of the city by some 16,000.[333]\r\n\r\nIn October, lack of the necessaries of life reached a climax, so that\r\nrats and mice were eaten. Since the scarcity of provender made it\r\nnecessary to slaughter almost all the horses, the soldiers were supplied\r\nwith large quantities of horse-meat. On November 1 the granaries, in\r\nwhich were kept the provisions of the garrison, were destroyed by fire,\r\nresulting in the loss of about two-thirds of the provisions. This made\r\nit necessary to reduce the soldiers’ bread-rations, and the bread with\r\nwhich they were supplied was made of half-burned flour and of rusks\r\nfished out of the stinking Mottlau; ‘it was so disgusting that only\r\nravenous hunger could induce anybody to eat it.’[334]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of hunger and the unnatural food eaten, the mortality\r\namong the civil inhabitants, the number of whom had dwindled down to\r\n16,000, became very high; the number of deaths per week in the month of\r\nOctober was no less than 50–80, to which, according to Blech, must be\r\nadded the deaths among the poor which were no longer reported. In the\r\nfirst part of November there were some 80–90 deaths per week. On\r\nNovember 29 General Rapp surrendered the city to the Russians and\r\nPrussians; but since the conditions of capitulation could not be agreed\r\nupon until January 1, 1814, there was an interval of about a month\r\nduring which the French garrison, but not the civil population, was\r\nsupplied with food; consequently the death-rate among the citizens\r\nremained high. Furthermore, the besiegers, among whom a virulent typhus\r\nhad been raging since October, communicated the infection to the\r\ninhabitants, 107 of whom succumbed to it in the last week of November,\r\n133 in the first week of December, and 138 in the following week. On\r\nDecember 1, permission was obtained to establish a market, and from that\r\ntime on, the citizens could once more provide themselves with food in a\r\nregular way.\r\n\r\nThe loss of human life inside the besieged stronghold was terrible; of\r\nthe 35,900 troops in the garrison, 15,736 according to Friccius died in\r\nthe lazarets; at the time of the capitulation only 16,532 men were left,\r\nand of these 1,482 were sick and had to be left in the city. According\r\nto Blech, a total of 5,592 civilians died, 1,142 of them in the last\r\nthree months (October-December) of the year; the number of deaths in\r\nDecember alone was 473. Toward the end of the siege some ninety persons\r\ndied of starvation.[335]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   3. THE SIEGE OF TORGAU (1813)[336]\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1813, when Napoleon had appeared in Saxony, and the King,\r\nafter considerable hesitation, had decided in his favour, the Saxon\r\ngarrison of Torgau, at that time a place of 5,000 inhabitants, was\r\nreplaced by a French army-corps. In the course of the summer large\r\ntransports of sick soldiers from various lazarets arrived at Torgau, and\r\non July 18 alone 3,000 sick men and 1,000 convalescents came from\r\nDresden. Consequently the number of sick in the stronghold was very\r\nlarge even before the siege began; all public buildings had been\r\nconverted into lazarets. But even these were not numerous or large\r\nenough to accommodate all the patients, who numbered some 6,000 in the\r\nmonth of September, so that the occupants of houses along entire streets\r\nwere driven out of their homes, which were used for lazarets and\r\nbarracks. ‘A virulent, putrid fever’ raged in all the lazarets, and at\r\nleast one-third of the persons who contracted it died; the inhabitants\r\nand the Frenchmen quartered in the homes of citizens were at first\r\nspared by the disease.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Dennewitz (September 6, 1813) the head-quarters of\r\nthe third and fourth French army-corps was transferred to Torgau, where\r\nalso numerous fugitives took refuge; at the same time the large French\r\nhead-quarters from Dresden arrived, so that the size of the garrison was\r\nincreased by 10,000 men and 5,000 horses. After the battle of Leipzig\r\nthe stronghold was besieged by the Prussians, and presently the supply\r\nof food ran low and the uncleanliness in the streets and houses grew\r\nincredibly worse. ‘Then the pestilence began to spread at an alarming\r\nrate among the inhabitants and among the Frenchmen quartered in the\r\nhomes of citizens, so that the entire city of Torgau came to resemble a\r\nlarge, overcrowded lazaret.’[337]\r\n\r\n‘The regular lazarets now became veritable hot-beds of misery; they were\r\nscarcely able to accommodate the large number of patients, who numbered\r\nat least 12,000, and whom it was necessary to place so close together\r\nthat they almost touched one another. There was a lack of straw and of\r\nother necessities, of sick-attendants and physicians, of effective\r\nremedies, and especially of order and proper superintendence.’ The\r\npatients suffered partly from severe, fetid diarrhoea, and partly from\r\ntyphus. In the courtyards there were enormous accumulations of dirt and\r\nrefuse, and the doors leading into many of the sick-rooms could scarcely\r\nbe opened owing to the collections of foul matter which covered the\r\nfloor ankle-deep; in order to reach the sick it was necessary to wade\r\nthrough this and to climb over dead bodies. Absolutely no thought was\r\ngiven to keeping the rooms warm. ‘Thus it is quite natural that among\r\nthese horrible surroundings the slightest wound, the most insignificant\r\nindisposition, could easily have a fatal termination, and that it was\r\nlike sentencing a man to death to bring him to the lazaret.’ The number\r\nof deaths exceeded 8,000 in the month of November alone.\r\n\r\nEqually terrible were the conditions in the other parts of the city; all\r\nthe private houses were overcrowded with patients and filled with dirt.\r\nA sickening odour permeated the atmosphere; in the ditches around the\r\nfortress and in every corner of the city lay dead horses, rotting straw\r\nsacks, ragged uniforms, and even human corpses. Refuse of the worst kind\r\nwas piled up in the streets, often as high as the second story. ‘At this\r\ntime’, says Lehmann, ‘Torgau looked more like a lazaret than a city\r\ninhabited by healthy persons; for who would have been able to find a\r\nhouse in which there were no persons suffering from nerve-fever?\r\nParlours, bedrooms, halls, stables, kitchens, and cellars—all were\r\nfilled with patients.’ The barracks and guard-rooms resembled hospitals.\r\nIn a few weeks more than 600 inhabitants died; entire families were\r\nwiped out by the epidemic, and there was scarcely one which was not\r\nmourning the loss of one of its members.\r\n\r\nUp to the beginning of December the number of patients steadily\r\nincreased; in the lazarets alone, 300 soldiers died every day.\r\n\r\nThe terrors of the bombardment had a very disastrous effect upon the\r\ninhabitants of the city, since it compelled them to live in damp,\r\nunhealthy, infected cellars. Not until the latter part of December did\r\nthe epidemic begin to abate and to lose, at the same time, its virulent\r\ncharacter; the arrival of very cold weather, as well as the diminution\r\nof the number of people, and the fact that the infection had practically\r\nrun its course among the inhabitants and the garrison, were at least\r\npartly responsible for this abatement; furthermore, there was now less\r\ncrowding, and it became possible to establish better order.\r\n\r\nThe lack of system in the French lazarets is shown by the fact that the\r\nauthorities were never once able to give an account of the number of\r\npersons that died in them. From grave-diggers’ records and church\r\nregisters Richter managed to compile the following table of statistics\r\nindicating the number of deaths:[338]\r\n\r\n                         _French     _Saxon       _Civil      _Total._\r\n                       soldiers._  soldiers._  inhabitants._\r\n January-August (1813)                                   222\r\n September                   1,107          64            43       1,214\r\n October                     4,803          36            66       4,905\r\n November                    8,209           3           228       8,440\r\n December                    4,886                       258       5,144\r\n January 1–10 (1814)           649                        83         732\r\n January 11–31                 314                        91         405\r\n February                      400                        79         479\r\n March                         100                        52         152\r\n\r\nAccording to this table there died, between September and January 10,\r\n19,654 French soldiers, 103 Saxon soldiers, and 678 civilians. But\r\nRichter says in regard to the above figures: ‘There is no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the figures pertaining to the French soldiers are much too\r\nsmall, since they include only those that were actually buried by the\r\ngrave-diggers in public burial-grounds. All those who died in private\r\nhouses, in the _tête-de-pont_, in the various forts, in the lunettes, or\r\nin any of the outworks of the fortress are not included; their number\r\nwas by no means small, and many of them were buried unceremoniously by\r\ncitizens or by their comrades, while large numbers of bodies were left\r\nlying in the open.’ In the month of May it was impossible to find a\r\ngrave-digger to bury the heaps of corpses, which were consequently\r\nthrown in masses into the Elbe; this of course interfered with the\r\noperation of the floating mills along the river. Nor are the bodies\r\ndisposed of in this way included in the above table. Accordingly,\r\nRichter estimates the total number of deaths among the French soldiers\r\nat between 29,000 and 30,000 men.\r\n\r\nThe pestilence continued to rage even after the surrender of the\r\nstronghold, and did not begin to abate until the latter part of January.\r\nAlthough the Prussian troops were not quartered in the city, and entered\r\nit only in the day-time, the pestilence nevertheless spread to them and\r\ncarried away more than 300 men in the course of three months. Not until\r\nthe end of February did the pestilence among the civil inhabitants begin\r\nto abate; the mortality was still high in March, but in April it sank to\r\nnormal again.\r\n\r\nAccording to Richter, two-thirds of the patients in the military lazaret\r\nwere suffering from ‘colliquative, dysenteric diarrhoea’, and only\r\none-third from ‘true typhus’, whereas among the civil inhabitants the\r\nlatter was by far the more common. There were two forms of diarrhoea\r\nobserved; it appeared either as an acute attack of dysentery, which\r\nrarely lasted longer than two weeks and then terminated in either death\r\nor recovery, or else as a chronic, dysenteric diarrhoea, which caused\r\ngeneral weakness and finally death.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever began always with a frequently recurring chill, and with a\r\nviolent headache and general indisposition; this was followed by a stage\r\nof dry fever, accompanied by stupor, dizziness, and often wild delirium;\r\nas a rule the first few days were characterized by obstinate\r\nconstipation, and bleeding at the nose was very common. Later on,\r\nsomnolence manifested itself, and the original constipation changed to a\r\ncopious, fetid diarrhoea. Petechiae appeared frequently, but not\r\ninvariably; at first small, bright-red spots showed themselves, and\r\nlater on they assumed a darker colour, grew larger, and finally turned\r\nblack. Their size varied considerably; sometimes they were the size of a\r\npin-head, while often they were from one to one-and-a-half centimetres\r\nin diameter. Most of the patients died between the tenth and fifteenth\r\ndays; but if the disease progressed favourably, signs of improvement\r\nusually showed themselves suddenly on the fourteenth or fifteenth day;\r\nas a rule, convalescence was of short duration.\r\n\r\nThe two forms of ‘nerve-fever’ mentioned by Richter doubtless include\r\nvarious other diseases. That many cases of typhus fever were among the\r\nfever patients may be inferred from the fact that the disease was very\r\nprevalent among the French troops, and also from Richter’s description;\r\nhe expressly mentions the sudden appearance of the disease, the initial\r\nchill, the remission of the fever in the third week, and the rapid\r\nconvalescence—all of them characteristic signs of typhus fever.\r\nMoreover, typhoid fever doubtless prevailed more or less extensively.\r\nRichter describes ‘a pituitous modification of typhus’, with a lingering\r\ndevelopment;[339] the crisis always came late, frequently not until the\r\nsixth or seventh week, and was invariably uncertain, so that\r\nconvalescence was very slow and often interrupted by relapses.\r\nDeuteropathic complications were of almost regular occurrence. There can\r\nbe no doubt that we have to do here with a good description of typhoid\r\nfever, which revealed its presence chiefly among the newly-conscripted\r\nyoung French soldiers.\r\n\r\nRegarding the enormous loss of life caused by the epidemic in Torgau,\r\nRichter, who was a Prussian military physician, says: ‘The devastation\r\nthat it caused among the Frenchmen, and unfortunately among the\r\ninhabitants of the ill-fated city as well, was indeed terrible; in fact\r\nthere is happily scarcely a parallel to it in the history of the world.\r\nOne may safely say that the misery experienced by the French troops\r\nthroughout the entire course of that disastrous war reached its climax\r\ninside the walls of Torgau. The French lazarets in the city represented\r\nscenes of horror such as repel human nature, and such as one must\r\nactually witness in order to appreciate fully their dreadfulness.’\r\n\r\n\r\n                   4. THE SIEGE OF MAYENCE (1813–14)\r\n\r\nThe terrible devastation caused by typhus fever in the strongholds along\r\nthe Vistula, Elbe, and Rhine, which were so valorously defended by\r\nFrench generals in the years 1813–14, excited general consternation.\r\nWittmann[340] furnishes a very accurate description of the misery\r\nundergone in the besieged cities, especially the city of Mayence. First\r\nhe comments on the scarcity of supplies, observing that the vicissitudes\r\nof war can never be foreseen; furthermore, he asserts that the\r\ncommanders of fortresses, when they anticipated a siege, purposely kept\r\nthe inhabitants in uncertainty about it. In the case of Mayence,\r\nNapoleon ordered the city to be provisioned after the battle of Leipzig.\r\nSome 2,000 oxen were collected, and most of them were kept in the\r\nvillages surrounding Mayence; but when the Allies crossed the Rhine the\r\noxen were all quickly driven into the city, where they grew lean owing\r\nto lack of provender, and died of rinderpest in such large numbers that\r\nit became necessary to slaughter them all and salt the meat. This was\r\ndone in such a careless way that a large part of the meat was spoiled;\r\neven after the stronghold surrendered, some of this salted meat was\r\nstill on hand, and it was so rotten that it had to be destroyed. The\r\ncitizens had learned of the danger too late, and numerous unscrupulous\r\ncitizens bought up all the important necessaries of life and then took\r\nadvantage of the situation by raising the prices so high that only the\r\nwealthy could procure food. Lack of good bread, which had been so scarce\r\nduring the previous siege of Mayence (1793), does not seem to have been\r\nso severely felt in the siege of 1813. Particularly noticeable was the\r\nwant of fuel, so that many soldiers froze to death in the exposed\r\nguard-rooms of the outworks. Legumes, especially peas, could not be\r\nthoroughly cooked, so that it was frequently necessary to throw them\r\naway. The supply of good fat, as well as of fresh vegetables, soon ran\r\nout, while the great quantity of alcoholic beverages stored up in\r\nMayence had a very detrimental effect. Very inadequate provision was\r\nmade for the sheltering of the soldiers; inasmuch as the siege took\r\nplace in the winter, they could not camp in the open, and the barracks\r\nwere not large or numerous enough to accommodate them. Consequently the\r\nofficers were quartered in the homes of the wealthier citizens, one\r\nofficer in each house, while the troops were housed in large numbers in\r\nthe often insanitary homes of the poorer people. This of course greatly\r\nfavoured the dissemination of infectious diseases.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wittmann, there was not a single trace of an infectious\r\ndisease in Mayence in September 1813. In October the field-lazarets of\r\nthe army were transferred from Leipzig to the West, and most of them\r\npassed through Mayence; in the first part of November, moreover, the\r\nfield-army itself passed through the city on its return march; thus sick\r\nand healthy soldiers conveyed typhus fever into the stronghold. ‘In the\r\nvicinity of the hospitals and churches, where sick soldiers were\r\ncongregated, in the streets through which these doomed victims passed,\r\nand in the houses in which they were quartered together with healthy\r\nmen, or into which they had crept from sheer inability to go further,\r\ncontagious typhus broke out first and with the greatest severity.’[341]\r\nDr. Petit, the commissary sent out by the government in Paris, did not\r\nhave the courage to oppose the will of Marshal Marmont, who was in chief\r\ncommand, and so he sought to pacify the inhabitants by means of notices\r\nin the papers to the effect that the prevailing disease was neither\r\nepidemic nor infectious, and was only contagious typhus.\r\n\r\nAfter the investment was complete, typhus fever caused terrible\r\ndevastation throughout the city. When the siege began, Mayence had a\r\ngarrison of some 30,000 men, while the civil inhabitants numbered about\r\n24,500; to the latter, however, must be added a considerable number of\r\nrefugees from the surrounding country. The bad hospital arrangements, as\r\nalways happened at that time, greatly helped to spread the disease in\r\nMayence. According to a report made out by two French physicians and\r\nreproduced by Wittmann, the air in the hospitals was terrible; every bed\r\nwas occupied by two patients, while the straw under them and the\r\nblankets over them were never changed or washed, so that they must\r\nnecessarily have constituted a source of infection. A report by\r\nKerckhoffs[342] regarding the Mayence hospitals describes even worse\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I was appointed to serve in the hospital established in the\r\n  Municipal Octroi Building, and the first time that I went there I\r\n  found the living and the dead, the wounded and the sick, scattered\r\n  in confusion all over the place. The sick were stretched out on the\r\n  floor, without even straw under them, covered with ordure. I was\r\n  obliged to pick my way on tip-toe in order not to sink up to the\r\n  ankles in filth. I saw sick men lying beside the dead bodies of\r\n  their comrades. In effect, there were so many of them that they were\r\n  lying on top of one another. In some of the rooms the windows were\r\n  closed, so that no air could enter; in other rooms there was neither\r\n  glass nor boarding in the doors or windows, notwithstanding the\r\n  extreme cold. The sick men told me that they had been in that same\r\n  position for two, three, and even four days, without having had a\r\n  drop of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe soldiers under arrest, who were compelled to clean out the\r\nhospitals, all died, no more sick-attendants were to be found, and a\r\nlarge number of physicians perished in the performance of their duties;\r\nall the persons employed in the hospital entirely neglected their\r\nduties, and most of them were drunk all the time, since large quantities\r\nof wine were on hand for the patients.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the epidemic gradually attained to enormous\r\ndimensions. ‘The infection’, says Wittmann,[343] ‘carried away all the\r\ngrave-diggers one by one, and it was impossible to find anybody who was\r\nwilling to do that dangerous work. Thousands of dead bodies of citizens\r\nand soldiers lay for weeks in front of the Münstertor, where they were\r\npiled up like logs pending burial.’ In December and January the epidemic\r\nreached its climax; after that it gradually abated, but did not come to\r\nan end until May 3, 1814, when the siege terminated and the Allies\r\nentered the city.\r\n\r\nIn the period between November 1, 1813, and May 3, 1814, 7,000 deaths\r\namong the soldiers are recorded in the civil register of the city;\r\naccording to statements of the grave-diggers, some 10,000 or 11,000 more\r\nsoldiers were buried, whose names were not entered in the register for\r\nthe reason that they could not be ascertained; nor do the above figures\r\ninclude the number of deaths in the stronghold of Kastel on the other\r\nside of the Rhine. Of the civil inhabitants, 2,445 (about one-tenth of\r\nthe population) died; a large number of physicians contracted the\r\ndisease, and four physicians and five surgeons succumbed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  5. THE SIEGE OF PARIS (1870–1)[344]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Sedan the Germans immediately began to march toward\r\nParis; on September 15, 1870, the first cavalrymen appeared before the\r\ncapital, and on September 19 the investment was complete.\r\n\r\nAn exhaustive account by H. Sueur and a large number of other reports\r\noffer us very full information regarding the condition of health in\r\nParis during the siege, since the administrative apparatus never stopped\r\nrunning. The approach of the German armies caused numerous well-to-do\r\ncitizens to leave the city; some went south, some to Switzerland, and\r\nsome to England. Sueur estimates their number from the reports of the\r\nrailroad companies at 300,000. On the other hand, a large number of the\r\ninhabitants of the surrounding country sought refuge in the city; their\r\nnumber is estimated at 180,000. Furthermore, the size of the garrison\r\nwas considerably increased; the number of men in the regular army on\r\nNovember 4, 1870, is estimated at 236,941, and this does not include\r\n8,000 men in the First Division of the First Corps. To the above,\r\nmoreover, must be added the number of soldiers who died between the\r\nbeginning and the end of the siege. Thus the number of men in the\r\nregular army at the beginning of the siege was some 246,000; of these\r\nsome 56,000 were already in the city in the middle of the summer, while\r\nthe remaining 190,000 arrived later. Accordingly, the total number of\r\npeople in the city shortly before the siege began was increased by\r\n70,000. Legoyt estimated the population of the city on July 1, 1870, at\r\n1,890,000, so that on the opening day of the investment there were\r\n1,960,000 (in round numbers, 2,000,000) people in Paris. The arrival of\r\nthe 190,000 soldiers altered the composition of the population, since\r\nthe increase augmented only the number of males between the ages of 20\r\nand 40.\r\n\r\nA severe epidemic of small-pox raged in Paris, as stated above, even\r\nbefore the siege took place. In the first part of the siege, moreover,\r\nthe disease raged with even greater fury in the city, since most of the\r\nyoung newly-enlisted mobile guards had never been vaccinated. The\r\nmaximum of deaths caused by it were reported between November 6 and\r\nNovember 27. We have already described the course of the small-pox\r\nepidemic in Paris.[345] It was influenced neither by hunger nor by cold,\r\nbut developed chiefly for the reason that it was impossible to\r\ncongregate and isolate the large number of unvaccinated and susceptible\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever, dysentery, and diarrhoea, because of the unfavourable\r\nconditions brought about by the siege, became very widespread and\r\nvirulent. Whereas in the year 1869 there were 630 deaths caused by\r\ntyphoid fever, during the siege of 1870 no less than 3,475 persons\r\nsuccumbed to that disease. Dupinet[346] thinks that the above number is\r\ntoo small, because the disease was often not recognized, and pneumonia,\r\na common complication, was entered as the cause of death. Inasmuch as\r\ntyphoid fever was endemic in Paris, and as the native inhabitants had\r\nacquired immunity by recovery from an attack in the early part of their\r\nlives, those who were most severely afflicted by the disease were\r\nchiefly the soldiers in the army and the refugees from the surrounding\r\ncountry. The largest number of deaths was reported in the twentieth week\r\nof the siege, i.e. between January 14 and 20.[347] No less than 375\r\npersons succumbed to typhoid fever in the course of that week, whereas\r\nin the corresponding week of the previous year only sixteen deaths had\r\nbeen reported. The largest number of deaths caused by dysentery and\r\ndiarrhoea in a single week was reported somewhat later; the limited\r\nprevalence of these diseases during the siege is indicated by the fact\r\nthat in the half-year 1869–70 the number of deaths caused by them was\r\nnever more than twenty per week. From statistics compiled by Sueur we\r\nhave arranged the following table (p. 323), which also includes the\r\ndeaths caused by bronchitis and pneumonia, but not the victims buried on\r\nthe battle-fields, of whom there were some 3,000.\r\n\r\nThe table indicates the gradual diminution of the food-supply. In\r\nDecember the quality of the bread grew worse and worse; white bread\r\ncould no longer be baked, and in its place an almost inedible form of\r\nbrown bread was made out of bran, wheat, rye, rice, barley, and oats.\r\nParticularly noticeable was the lack of good fats, making it necessary\r\nto prepare foods with a bad-tasting tallow that was sold under the name\r\nof ‘Beurre de Paris’. Since the cattle had to be slaughtered (those that\r\nwere not killed died of various diseases), there was very soon a great\r\nscarcity of milk, making it very difficult to feed infants.[348]\r\n\r\nSeveral persons have maintained that the extreme cold exerted\r\nconsiderable influence upon the death-rate; and a glance at the two\r\ncolumns in the table indicating the number of deaths caused by pneumonia\r\nand bronchitis would seem to justify this contention. How great the\r\ndifference was, as compared with normal years, will be obvious when we\r\ncall attention to the fact that, whereas in the twenty-second week of\r\nthe siege (January 28–February 3) 627 persons succumbed to bronchitis,\r\nin the preceding year only seventy-six deaths were caused by that\r\ndisease between January 30 and February 5, and that, whereas from 465 to\r\n468 persons succumbed to pneumonia between January 21 and February 18,\r\n1871, the number of deaths caused by that disease in the corresponding\r\nperiod of the previous year varied from 90 to 119 per week.\r\n\r\nAccording to the unanimous verdict of the Paris physicians, typhus fever\r\ndid not make its appearance during the siege.\r\n\r\n                  MORTALITY DURING THE SIEGE OF PARIS\r\n\r\n ──────┬───────────────┬───────────────────────────────┬────────┬───────\r\n  _No. │_First and last│   _Important ordinances and   │_Average│_Total\r\n of the│  day of the   │           events._            │  no.   │  no.\r\n week._│    week._     │                               │ deaths │deaths\r\n       │               │                               │ in the │during\r\n       │               │                               │ years  │  the\r\n       │               │                               │1867–9._│siege._\r\n ──────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────────────┼────────┼───────\r\n   〃   │       〃       │               〃               │   〃    │   〃\r\n       │               │                               │        │\r\n ──────┼───────────────┼───────────────────────────────┼────────┼───────\r\n      1│Sept. 4–10     │                               │     889│    981\r\n      2│Sept. 11–17    │                               │     852│   1263\r\n      3│Sept. 18–24    │Sept. 19, investment completed │     821│   1272\r\n      4│Sept. 25–Oct. 1│                               │     766│   1344\r\n      5│Oct. 2–8       │Oct. 8, meat ration fixed at   │        │\r\n       │               │  100 gr. for adults, 50 gr.   │        │\r\n       │               │  for children                 │     754│   1483\r\n      6│Oct. 9–15      │                               │     737│   1610\r\n      7│Oct. 16–22     │                               │     761│   1746\r\n      8│Oct. 23–9      │                               │     754│   1878\r\n      9│Oct. 30–Nov. 5 │Oct. 30, requisition of fuel   │     767│   1762\r\n     10│Nov. 6–12      │                               │     781│   1885\r\n     11│Nov. 13–19     │                               │     780│   2064\r\n     12│Nov. 20–26     │Nov. 21, requisition of        │        │\r\n       │               │  potatoes                     │     793│   1927\r\n     13│Nov. 27–Dec. 3 │                               │     833│   2023\r\n     14│Dec. 4–10      │                               │     833│   2455\r\n     15│Dec. 11–17     │Dec. 15, horse-meat ration     │        │\r\n       │               │  fixed at 50 gr. per head     │     884│   2728\r\n     16│Dec. 18–24     │Dec. 19, reduction of bread    │        │\r\n       │               │  ration to 300 gr. for        │        │\r\n       │               │  adults,150 gr. for children  │     854│   2728\r\n     17│Dec. 25–31     │                               │     856│   3280\r\n     18│Jan. 1–6       │Jan. 4, beginning of           │        │\r\n       │               │  bombardment                  │     838│   3680\r\n     19│Jan. 7–13      │                               │     902│   3982\r\n     20│Jan. 14–20     │                               │     903│   4465\r\n     21│Jan. 21–7      │                               │     936│   4376\r\n     22│Jan. 28–Feb. 3 │                               │     951│   4671\r\n     23│Feb. 4–10      │Feb. 4, armistice.

Delpech[349]\r\nattributes the appearance of the disease to the lack of fresh\r\nvegetables, which were very expensive and could not be given out in the\r\npublic establishments. Among the soldiers the disease broke out only in\r\nFort Bicêtre, the garrison in which consisted of 800 marines, of whom\r\nsome seventy or seventy-five contracted it. None of them were given any\r\nsalted meat, and Grenet[350] contends that the outbreak was caused by\r\nthe lack of light and air in the small casemates, and by arduous\r\nservice, especially in the night. But here, too, the real cause was\r\nprobably to be found in the lack of fresh vegetables, which Grenet does\r\nnot mention.\r\n\r\nThe death-rate in Paris during the siege was about three times as high\r\nas normal. Sueur has estimated that in the years 1867–9 the mortality in\r\nthe twenty-eight weeks corresponding with those in the above table was\r\n13·1 per 1,000 inhabitants, whereas in the twenty-eight weeks of the\r\nsiege the mortality was 38·6 per 1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   6. THE SIEGE OF PORT ARTHUR (1904)\r\n\r\nPort Arthur was besieged by the Japanese from July 30, 1904, to January\r\n2, 1905—a period of 156 days. Whereas, as stated in the last chapter,\r\nthe condition of health in the Russian army was good, the sanitary\r\nconditions in Port Arthur during the siege were very bad, since the\r\nsupply of provisions that had been laid in proved to be\r\ninsufficient.[351] The offer made on August 16 by General Nogi and\r\nAdmiral Togo, granting all the women, children (under 16 years),\r\necclesiastics, members of the diplomatic corps and military and naval\r\nattachés of foreign powers permission to leave the stronghold, was\r\nrefused by General Stössel. As early as August 5 horse-meat began to be\r\ndistributed;[352] from September 17 on the troops were supplied four\r\ntimes a week with horse-meat, since there was no other fresh or canned\r\nmeat available. At this time almost everything in the city was consumed,\r\nthough the Chinese secretly brought rice, eggs, and other things, on\r\nboats from Chufoo. After September 28 the soldiers were given meat only\r\ntwice a week (one-half of a pound of horse-meat or one-third of a can of\r\npreserved meat). Regarding conditions up to October 20 we are informed\r\nby the report of the Russian General Medical Staff:[353] ‘The supply of\r\nfood ran lower and lower; beef gave out very early, only a small\r\nquantity of canned meat was left, and even the portions of horse-meat\r\nhad to be dealt out very sparingly, as we had very important use for\r\nhorses in transporting ammunition, water, food, &c., to the various\r\npositions. In the city it became more and more difficult every day to\r\nprocure food; meat, if by any chance a small quantity was marketed, was\r\nsold in the stores for one and one-half roubles per pound. A chicken\r\ncost twelve roubles, a goose twenty roubles, an egg one rouble, a pound\r\nof onions one rouble, a pound of horse-meat one half-rouble.’\r\n\r\nIn November all the soldiers were given was horse-meat; only the sick\r\nreceived canned meat. The supply of food in the possession of private\r\nindividuals was exhausted, while garlic and vegetables had given out\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nOn September 19 the Japanese captured the redoubts controlling one of\r\nthe aqueducts that supplied Port Arthur with water; there was however\r\nanother aqueduct, and, furthermore, wells were bored and a plant for\r\ndistilling seawater was put into operation. The statement of the Russian\r\nGeneral Staff that there was at no time a serious scarcity of water is\r\nnot confirmed in Olga von Baumgarten’s diary, which frequently refers in\r\nplaintive terms to the lack of drinking-water in the lazarets.[354]\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the condition of health among the Russian troops was\r\ncomparatively good;[355] on August 26 there were 132 officers and 5,661\r\nmen in the lazarets. In the first part of October typhoid fever broke\r\nout in Port Arthur, where it was endemic, and before long an epidemic of\r\nsuch severity was raging in the city that it was difficult to find\r\nplaces in which to shelter the patients. There were also a great many\r\ncases of dysentery. Owing to the lack of preserved meat and vegetables,\r\nscurvy also made its appearance; the first cases of the disease were\r\nobserved early in October. In the latter part of that month there were\r\nin the lazarets 450 typhoid-fever patients, 855 dysentery patients, and\r\n167 scurvy patients. In addition to these diseases, cases of\r\nnight-blindness (inability to see after dusk) were observed; the latter\r\ndisease is quite common among Russian country-people, being caused by\r\nbad nourishment.\r\n\r\nIn December the garrison was completely exhausted. Scurvy had become\r\nmore and more widespread, and between the fourteenth and twenty-seventh\r\nof that month 71 officers and 1,790 men had been committed to the\r\nlazarets. On the day of the surrender (January 2, 1905) the number of\r\nmen in the Russian garrison was 32,400, and of these 6,458 were lying\r\nsick or wounded in the lazarets.[356] Of the remaining 25,942 men,\r\n13,207 were incapacitated; thus the number of healthy men (besides 2,193\r\nmarines) in the garrison at the time of the surrender was only 12,735.\r\nRegarding the loss of life during the siege we find no information in\r\nthe report of the General Staff. The number of soldiers in the city\r\n(excluding the officers and officials) was 41,780 at the beginning and\r\n32,400 at the end of the siege. No further information regarding the\r\ncondition of health among the civil inhabitants of Port Arthur is\r\nobtainable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of war-pestilences has shown how severely belligerent armies\r\nare attacked by infectious diseases, how seriously their operations are\r\nhampered by them, and what loss of life such diseases cause by spreading\r\nto non-combatants. If we start from the time when more or less accurate\r\ndescriptions enable us to determine the nature of the epidemics, we find\r\nthat plague and typhus fever were the two diseases which, until a few\r\ndecades ago, most commonly attacked the soldiers; the latter disease,\r\nwhich made its appearance in almost every war that was waged between the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth and the middle of the nineteenth century,\r\nconsequently acquired the name ‘war-plague’.\r\n\r\nFor a long time nobody knew just how to combat these pestilences, and\r\nnowhere were rational measures adopted aiming to prevent them from\r\nspreading. We have seen the bitter truth of this statement in connexion\r\nwith the endless Napoleonic wars. One reason for the neglect of\r\npreventive measures was the belief that these pestilences broke out\r\nspontaneously when large numbers were crowded together under miserable\r\nliving conditions. The physicians of that time, in their efforts to\r\nexplain the sudden appearance of these pestilences, arrived at the\r\nconclusion that they were autochthonic. But modern medical science,\r\nrealizing its limitations, contents itself with the hypothesis that the\r\noriginal cause of these diseases is not to be ascertained, and with the\r\nknowledge that the infective agents in the case of almost all of them\r\nhave been discovered, and that an outbreak of any infectious disease in\r\nany specific locality signifies that the germ of that disease must in\r\nsome way have been deposited there. It was precisely the belief in the\r\nspontaneous origination of pestilences that led people to neglect\r\nwatching for and isolating, with all possible dispatch, the first\r\ncases—a measure which is to-day looked upon as the most important means\r\nof preventing the dissemination of a disease.\r\n\r\nThe belief in the autochthonic origin of diseases continued to prevail\r\nuntil the first half of the nineteenth century. Hecker upheld it in a\r\ndiscussion of the plague-epidemic that occurred during the Russo-Turkish\r\nWar of 1769–70; he believed that the intermittent fever prevalent in the\r\nDanube countries passed over into putrid fever, with or without\r\npetechiae, that carbuncles and buboes gradually developed, and that\r\nputrid fever was thus converted into bubonic plague. ‘It is therefore in\r\nall probability true’, says Hecker, ‘that the outbreak of plague in the\r\nRussian army in the year 1770, as well as in the year 1828, was not\r\ncaused by direct infection from the Turkish troops, but was merely an\r\nindependent development from intermittent fever and spotted fever.’\r\n\r\nRecent investigations in the field of medicine turn over to the other\r\nsciences all questions regarding ultimate causes, and confine themselves\r\nto what is actually observed. We know that the agents responsible for\r\ninfectious diseases are specific minute organisms which must be present\r\nin the system to produce the disease in question, and that these\r\nmicro-organisms are conveyed from place to place by infected persons, by\r\nintermediaries, on articles to which they have attached themselves, in\r\ncontaminated food, in drinking-water, and in many other ways.\r\nInvestigators have studied the conditions in which these infective\r\nagents live and the manner in which they are disseminated, they have\r\ndiscovered methods of determining the nature of the disease in a very\r\nshort time, and they have come to recognize the danger of coming in\r\ncontact with germ-bearers, that is, with persons, healthy or\r\nconvalescent, who have these micro-organisms in their systems without\r\nbeing themselves sick. Medical science is now endeavouring, by means of\r\nsystematic procedure and splendid organization, to guard soldiers\r\nagainst the danger of infection; good drinking-water is provided, the\r\nmen and the rooms in which they live are kept clean, persons suffering\r\nfrom infectious diseases are isolated, all rooms and articles used by\r\npatients are disinfected, infected divisions of troops are quartered by\r\nthemselves, germ-bearers are watched for and discovered, &c. The success\r\nof such measures is well known. The knowledge gained and profited by in\r\ntimes of peace is also applied in times of war, and to-day we are able\r\nto confine pestilences within much narrower limits than was formerly\r\npossible. In order to do this, however, we must have, in addition to an\r\nefficient system of transporting and feeding troops, physicians who are\r\nwell informed in regard to hygiene and bacteriology.\r\n\r\nAs early as the eighteenth century, successful efforts were made to\r\nprevent, by means of energetic measures, the reappearance of plague in\r\nEurope; the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–9 was the last war in which it\r\nbroke out. On the other hand, typhus fever continued to be the Nemesis\r\nof belligerent armies, while a new infectious disease, cholera, entered\r\nupon the scene and played a very important rôle in the Crimean War, and\r\na by no means minor rôle in the war of 1866. Along with these diseases,\r\ntyphoid fever advanced into the foreground about the middle of the last\r\ncentury, and it soon turned out to be one of the most dangerous diseases\r\nthat occur among soldiers. This appearance of typhoid fever has led some\r\nto think that the disease has prevailed extensively only in\r\ncomparatively recent times. Hirsch, however, ably defends the opposite\r\nview; he maintains that typhoid fever was in many instances confused\r\nwith the _febres pestilentes_, _malignae_, _putridae_, and _nervosae_,\r\nwith the mucous fevers, bilious fevers, putrid fevers, &c. In discussing\r\nthe typhus-fever epidemics that occurred in the course of the Napoleonic\r\nwars, we have several times called attention to the fact that typhoid\r\nfever probably broke out in the form of epidemics; but it could be\r\ndiagnosed with certainty only after post-mortem examinations began to be\r\nmore frequent. At all events, typhoid fever is to-day prevalent all over\r\nthe world, and there is always danger that field-armies will be infected\r\nwith it, either in their own land or in the land of the enemy. All the\r\nwars of the last few decades have clearly demonstrated this fact.\r\n\r\nFor a successful battle against war-pestilences, it is a fortunate\r\ncoincidence that the civil as well as the military authorities are\r\nequally interested in their prevention. Every military leader knows how\r\nimportant it is for the soldiers to keep healthy, since their efficiency\r\nis otherwise seriously impaired. It is not our task to describe the\r\nparticular measures that are to be adopted; the manuals of military\r\nsanitation give us accurate information regarding these matters. We\r\nmerely mention the fact that it is of great value and importance to have\r\nphysicians, who are well acquainted with hygienic problems, make a\r\npreliminary examination of sanitary conditions in the territory through\r\nwhich the soldiers will be required to pass in order to reach the scene\r\nof hostilities.\r\n\r\nVery great difficulties, to be sure, confront the efforts made in war\r\ntimes to prevent the outbreak of infectious diseases. If the struggle is\r\ncarried on in an infected region, the troops are often compelled to seek\r\nshelter in infected houses; thus during the battles of Orléans and Le\r\nMans in the Franco-German War the troops, in order to protect themselves\r\nagainst the severe winter cold, had to live in houses which small-pox\r\npatients had shortly before occupied or were actually occupying at the\r\ntime. Circumstances frequently arise which render impossible the\r\nadoption of the most effective measure calculated to prevent the\r\ndissemination of a pestilence, that is, the isolation of infected\r\ndivisions of troops; one can readily imagine how difficult this would be\r\nin the case of an army re-forming after a lost battle. Furthermore, even\r\nif one of the belligerent armies is doing all it can to prevent diseases\r\nfrom spreading, its efforts must be seriously handicapped if the enemy’s\r\narmy does not include an equally diligent sanitary corps and does not\r\ndevote the same amount of energy to the prevention of the outbreak and\r\ndissemination of infectious diseases. For even if a sanitary corps is\r\nsuccessful in warding off a reaction upon its own troops, nevertheless\r\nthis reaction is sure to take place with respect to the civil\r\ninhabitants of the country in which the war is waged.\r\n\r\nDuring a war, the civil authorities must also do their part in\r\npreventing diseases from spreading to the civil population. The local\r\nadministrations of a region in which fighting is going on are powerless.\r\nThe generals care very little whether or not a city or village in the\r\nenemy’s country is infected by their troops, whom they quarter in\r\nwhatever house or place best suits their purpose. On the other hand, the\r\ncommunities in which military prisons are located are confronted with a\r\nvery difficult problem, since these prisons, if infected men are\r\nconfined in them, easily develop into centres of infection; this fact\r\nwas observed a hundred times in the year 1870. If a disease breaks out\r\nin a community in consequence of the fact that a military prison has\r\nbeen established there, in my opinion it is incumbent on the central\r\ngovernment of the country to support the local authorities in their\r\nefforts to check the disease, and to give them financial help as well as\r\nscientific advice. Unfortunately, it is not to be denied that, in many\r\nsmall cities and in almost all rural communities, absolutely no\r\nprovision is made for the isolation of persons suffering from infectious\r\ndiseases; the authorities justify themselves with the reflection that in\r\ncase of emergency barracks can quickly be erected for the purpose, but\r\nat the same time they fail to remember that working-men are not always\r\navailable in the storm and stress of war times, that building materials\r\nin the general scarcity of supplies cannot always be procured with\r\nsufficient promptitude, and that pestilences, if the isolation of the\r\nfirst cases is delayed, usually spread with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nIn future wars we must expect the military authorities to do all they\r\ncan, just as soon as the prisoners are taken, to segregate as carefully\r\nas possible all known and suspected cases of infectious diseases. The\r\ndifficulties confronting the military authorities, when it is necessary\r\nto remove large numbers of prisoners with all possible dispatch away\r\nfrom the scene of the war, are, to be sure, very great.\r\n\r\nFinally, we must also call attention to the danger to which the civil\r\ninhabitants of a country are exposed, when the soldiers return home\r\nafter the termination of a campaign in an infected region. It must be\r\ndemanded under all circumstances that divisions of troops among whom\r\ninfectious diseases have made their appearance, before returning from\r\nthe enemy’s country, shall be subjected to a medical examination,\r\nisolated, and disinfected, just as was done on such a large scale, for\r\nexample, by the Japanese after the wars with China and Russia. This also\r\napplies to all other persons who have had anything to do with infected\r\ndivisions, particularly to teamsters.\r\n\r\nAll preparations designed to prevent the outbreak and dissemination of\r\ninfectious diseases must be made in times of peace; barracks and\r\nlazarets must be erected, physicians who are well acquainted with\r\nmethods of hygienic investigation must be available, and an adequate\r\nnumber of nurses and sick-attendants must be prepared for immediate\r\nservice at the very first appearance of an infectious disease. For the\r\nmilitary authorities, who can scarcely perform all the duties that the\r\nbeginning of a war imposes upon them, it will facilitate matters greatly\r\nif in future campaigns the Red Cross devotes its attention, not only to\r\nthe care of the wounded, but also, on a larger scale than it has\r\nheretofore, to the prevention of the outbreak and dissemination of\r\nwar-pestilences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Acre, pestilence, 14.\r\n\r\n Adrianople, bubonic plague epidemic 1829, 168 f.\r\n\r\n del Agua,

Berne in 1911, under the auspices of the\r\nDivision of Economics and History of the Carnegie Endowment for\r\nInternational Peace, appointed three Commissions to draft the questions\r\nand problems to be dealt with by competent authorities in all countries.\r\nThe first Commission was entrusted with _The Economic and Historical\r\nCauses and Effects of War_; the second with _Armaments in Time of\r\nPeace_; the third with _The Unifying Influences in International Life_.\r\nSubsequently the suggestions of the three Commissions were considered\r\nand approved by the entire Conference.\r\n\r\nThe questions are to be discussed scientifically, and as far as possible\r\nwithout prejudice either for or against war; and their discussion may\r\nhave such important consequences that the questions are presented below\r\n_in extenso_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Report of the First Commission\r\n         THE ECONOMIC AND HISTORICAL CAUSES AND EFFECTS OF WAR\r\n\r\nThe Conference recommends the following researches:\r\n\r\n1. Historical presentation of the causes of war in modern times, tracing\r\nespecially the influence exercised by the striving for greater political\r\npower, by the growth of the national idea, by the political aspirations\r\nof races and by economic interests.\r\n\r\n2. Conflicts of economic interests in the present age:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The influence of the growth of population and of the industrial\r\n  development upon the expansion of States.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The protectionist policy; its origin and basis; its method\r\n  of application and its influence upon the relations between\r\n  countries; bounties (open and disguised, public and private);\r\n  most-favoured-nation treatment; the attitude towards foreign goods\r\n  and foreign capital; the boycott; discouragement of foreign\r\n  immigration.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) International loans; the policy of guarantees; the relations of\r\n  the creditor to the debtor States; the use of loans for gaining\r\n  influence over other States.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) Rivalry among States with respect to capitalist investments in\r\n  foreign countries:\r\n\r\n    1. The endeavour to obtain a privileged position in banking\r\n    enterprises, in the opening and development of mines, in the letting\r\n    of public contracts, in the execution of public works, in the\r\n    building of railways (Siberian, Manchurian, Persian Bagdad Railway,\r\n    Adriatic Railway, &c.); in short, the organization of larger\r\n    capitalistic enterprises in foreign countries.\r\n\r\n    2. The hindering of foreign countries by convention from executing\r\n    productive enterprises on their own soil, e.g. from building\r\n    railways in their own countries.\r\n\r\n3. The anti-militarist movement, considered in its religious and\r\npolitical manifestations. (Only opposition to all military organization\r\nis here to be considered.)\r\n\r\n4. The position of organized labour and the socialists in the various\r\nStates on the questions of war and armaments.\r\n\r\n5. Is it possible to determine a special interest of individual classes\r\nmaking for or against war, for or against standing armies?\r\n\r\n6. The influence of women and woman suffrage upon war and armaments.\r\n\r\n7. The extension of obligatory military service in the different States,\r\nin times both of war and of peace.\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The conditions of military service; the system of enlistment and\r\n  of general obligatory service, the actual position of aliens.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The ratio of the persons obliged to render military service to\r\n  the entire population.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The influence of the present system of military obligation and\r\n  the organization of armies upon warfare and upon its duration.\r\n\r\n8. The economic effects of the right of capture and its influence upon\r\nthe development of navies.\r\n\r\n9. War loans provided by neutral countries; their extent and influence\r\non recent warfare.\r\n\r\n10. The effects of war:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Financial cost of war. The methods of meeting it: Taxation;\r\n  International Loans; External Loans.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Losses and gains from the point of view of public and private\r\n  economic interests; checks to production and the destruction of\r\n  productive forces; reduction of opportunities for business\r\n  enterprises; interruption of foreign trade and of the imports of food;\r\n  the destruction of property; shrinkage of values of property,\r\n  including securities; financial burden caused by new taxes, debts, and\r\n  war indemnities; effects upon private credit and upon savings banks;\r\n  advantages to those industries which furnish military materials;\r\n  advantages and disadvantages to neutral countries.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The effects of war upon the supply of the world with food and\r\n  raw materials, with special reference to those States which are in\r\n  large degree dependent upon other countries for such supplies, e.g.\r\n  Great Britain and Germany; by diversion of capital from those\r\n  countries which produce food and raw materials (especially the\r\n  stoppage of railway building and of new investments in agriculture and\r\n  other industries).\r\n\r\n  (_d_) The condition of the victorious State: manner of levy and use of\r\n  contributions and war indemnities; influence upon industry and social\r\n  life.\r\n\r\n  (_e_) The manner in which the energy of nations is stimulated or\r\n  depressed by war.\r\n\r\n11. Loss of human life in war and as a result of war: influence upon\r\npopulation (birth-rate, relation between the sexes, ratio of the various\r\nages, sanitary conditions).\r\n\r\n12. The influence of war and of the possibility of war upon the\r\nprotective policy, upon banking conditions (especially upon banks of\r\nissue), and upon monetary systems.\r\n\r\n13. The influence of annexation upon the economic life of the annexing\r\nStates, and upon the State whose territory has been annexed.\r\n\r\n14. The annexation of half-civilized or uncivilized peoples, considered\r\nespecially from the point of view of the economic interests, which act\r\nas motive powers; the methods through which private enterprises take\r\nroot in such regions and through which they bring influence to bear upon\r\ntheir own governments; the effects of such annexations upon the\r\ndevelopment of trade with the annexing State and with other countries,\r\nas well as upon the economic and social life of the natives.\r\n\r\n15. The progressive exemption of commercial and industrial activities\r\nfrom losses and interferences through war.\r\n\r\n16. Influence of the open-door policy upon war and peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Report of the Second Commission\r\n   ARMAMENTS IN TIME OF PEACE. MILITARY AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS. THE\r\n           THEORY, PRACTICE, AND HISTORY OF MODERN ARMAMENTS.\r\n\r\n1. Definition. Armaments might be described as ‘the preparations made by\r\na State either for defence or for attack’.

The effects of war preparations upon the economic and social life of\r\na nation:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) On the sustenance of the entire population of a country at war.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) On railway policy.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) On public administration and on social legislation.\r\n\r\n8. The economic effects of withdrawing young men from industrial\r\npursuits, into the army and navy:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Compulsory.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Of non-compulsory service (specially in the case of mercenary\r\n  troops).\r\n\r\n    (Allowance being made for the industrial value of military education\r\n    and training.)\r\n\r\n9. The influence of changes in the occupations of a people upon the\r\ncomposition and efficiency of armies, and the influence of the changes\r\nin the composition of armies on the economic life.\r\n\r\n10. Loans for armaments (participation of domestic and foreign capital).\r\n\r\n11. The industries of war, i.e. the various manufactures and other\r\nindustries which are promoted and encouraged by military and naval\r\nestablishments, distinguishing between:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) Government undertakings (arsenals, dockyards, &c.).\r\n\r\n  (_b_) Private undertakings, including the history and working of the\r\n  great armament firms, which sell to foreign customers as well as to\r\n  their own governments.\r\n\r\n12.

So far as possible the effect of\r\nrecent inventions upon offensive and defensive war should be indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Report of the Third Commission\r\n             THE UNIFYING INFLUENCES IN INTERNATIONAL LIFE\r\n\r\n1. The Conference is of the opinion that the economic life of individual\r\ncountries has definitely ceased to be self-contained; and that,\r\nnotwithstanding the barriers raised by fiscal duties, it is becoming in\r\never-increasing measure a part of an economic life in which the whole\r\nworld participates.\r\n\r\n2. It desires that this change be studied with the object of\r\nascertaining to what extent the economic life of individual nations has\r\nceased to be self-contained, and the causes which are bringing about the\r\ngreater interdependence of nations.\r\n\r\n3. Special attention should be paid to the following factors:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) How far the growth of population is responsible for the changes\r\n  that have occurred and are in progress.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The extent to which the insufficiency of the natural resources\r\n  of individual countries for their own requirements has contributed to\r\n  it.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) Whether the increasing economic unity of the world is the cause\r\n  or the result of the rising in the standard of living, and how far the\r\n  increasing welfare of nations has been caused by the growing unity.\r\n\r\n  (_d_) In what measure the need of individual countries to obtain\r\n  materials of production from other lands and to find new markets for\r\n  their own products is responsible for the growth of international\r\n  dependence.\r\n\r\n  4. The Conference desires that investigations be made into:\r\n\r\n  (_a_) The volume of the world’s production of all the many articles of\r\n  food, of the various raw materials, and of the principal manufactures.\r\n\r\n  (_b_) The productions of individual countries, and the extent to which\r\n  they are retained for home consumption or are exported.\r\n\r\n  (_c_) The consumption of individual countries, and the extent to which\r\n  the various articles are supplied from home productions or are\r\n  imported.\r\n\r\n5. The Conference wishes to ascertain to what extent the economy of\r\nproduction by large units, instead of by small units, has contributed to\r\nthe international dependence of nations.\r\n\r\n6. The development of this world-embracing economy has taken place in\r\ngreat measure in consequence of the investment of capital by rich\r\ncountries in less developed lands. Through this there have arisen close\r\nrelations and a great increase of wealth, not only for the lending and\r\nthe borrowing countries, but for all nations. The Conference is of the\r\nopinion that researches should be made into the extent of the\r\ninterdependence of the nations in the matter of capital.\r\n\r\n7. The Conference desires to institute inquiries into the\r\ninterdependence of the financial centres of the world.\r\n\r\n8. The Conference desires to make the unifying effects of international\r\ntrade, the building of railways, the progress of shipping, the\r\nimprovement and extension of all means of communication and the progress\r\nof inventions, the subjects of careful investigation.\r\n\r\n9. The Conference is in favour of making a comprehensive study of the\r\nvarious international unions and associations, in which the social and\r\neconomic interests of all classes of society are now either organized or\r\nin process of organization, through official or private action.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  This subject is discussed in a general way in the following works: J.\r\n  Pringle, _Beobachtungen über die Krankheiten einer Armee sowohl im\r\n  Felde als in Garnison_.
