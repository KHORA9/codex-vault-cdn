At the same time he cannot but\r\nregret, that in some quarters it has been surmised that he yielded\r\ncredence to the many strange relations which he has recorded from various\r\nmedical works, but which he merely narrated, to show the fallacy even of\r\nexperience, and the many dangers that may arise from the most ingenious\r\ntheories and doctrines, in the very ratio of their apparent plausibility.\r\n\r\nAlthough these sketches were not intended for the profession, yet they may\r\nprove of some utility to the pupil who commences the arduous study of\r\nmedicine. They may convince him, that great names, however justly\r\nrespected and renowned, do not constitute a sufficient basis, on which to\r\nrest a satisfactory and conclusive judgment; and, as Locke has justly\r\nobserved, that \"_reverence or prejudice must not be suffered to give\r\nbeauty or deformity to any of their opinions_.\" He will find that of which\r\nfurther experience will subsequently convince him, that medical\r\ninvestigation is too often founded upon analogy and hypothesis--but let\r\nnot this painful and disheartening impression arrest his progress, or\r\ndeter him from seeking to assist his judgment by collecting \"the scattered\r\nparts of truth,\" for in speaking of hypothesis, Dr. Crichton has thus\r\nexpressed himself: \"There is a period in knowledge, when it must be\r\nindulged in if we mean to make any progress; it is that period when the\r\nfacts are too numerous to be recollected without general principles, and\r\nyet, where the facts are too few to constitute a valid theory. If the\r\nexterior form of an edifice is often the principal motive with men for\r\nexamining its internal structure; so it is in science, that the splendour\r\nof an hypothesis, and the desire of proving its solidity, are more\r\nfrequent motives for research than a mere love of knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding our boasted progress in scientific pursuits, and our\r\nsupposed approach to perfection, there never perhaps was a period, since\r\nthe fanciful days of Paracelsus, Agrippa, and Van Helmont, when more\r\ndeceitful and fascinating reveries were indulged in than at the present\r\n_enlightened_ moment, nor more ingenuity and disingenuousness displayed in\r\nseeking to give substance to a vision or overthrowing its baseless fabric.\r\nIt is painful to be obliged to admonish the would be legislators of our\r\nbelief, in the words of the sceptical Bolingbroke:\r\n\r\n\"Folly and knavery have prevailed most where they should be tolerated the\r\nleast, and presumption has been excused most where diffidence and candour\r\nare on many accounts the most necessary.\r\n\r\n  \"Quale per incertam lunam sub luce maligna\r\n  Est iter in Silvis.\"\r\n\r\n  _Hanwell Lunatic Asylum,\r\n  Dec. 1838._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great success and correspondent utility of D'Israeli's \"Curiosities of\r\nLiterature,\" have induced me to add to the ample harvest of that ingenious\r\nwriter a few gleanings from another field. They may not afford the same\r\namusing variety to the general reader, but they may tend to draw some\r\nattention to many important points that affect the chequered lot of\r\nmankind. The progress that every science has rapidly made during the last\r\nhalf-century has been astounding, and seems to have kept pace with those\r\nstruggles of the intellectual faculties to burst from the shackles of\r\nprejudice and error that had ignobly bound them for so many ages. Groping\r\nin darkness, man sought the light, but unfortunately the sudden refulgence\r\nat times dazzled instead of guiding his steps in the pursuit of truth, and\r\nled him into errors as perilous as those that had surrounded him in his\r\nformer mental obscurity. His gigantic powers were aroused, but, too\r\nfrequently misapplied, they shook the social edifice to its very\r\nfoundation. The daring hand of innovation destroyed without contemplating\r\nwhat better fabric could be raised on the ruin: and while the nobler\r\nfaculties with which Providence had gifted us were exerted for the public\r\nweal, the baser parts of our passions sought liberty in licentiousness.\r\nAmbition degenerated into ferocity, scepticism led to impiety, and even\r\napparent virtue sought to propagate the doctrines of good, by assuming the\r\n\"goodly outside\" of vice. Religion was overthrown because priestcraft had\r\ndeceived, and high rank was held up to detestation because princes and\r\nnobles had been corrupt; and to use Shakespeare's words,\r\n\r\n                      Thus we debase\r\n  The nature of our seats, and make the rabble\r\n  Call our cares, fears; which will in time break ope\r\n  The lock o' the senate, and bring in the crows\r\n  To peck the eagles.\r\n\r\nIn ten short years this mighty revolution in the intellect of man took\r\nplace,--in a country too that may be considered the cradle of the future\r\nweal and woe, perhaps of the universe;--in ten short years we beheld\r\nMontesquieu, Raynal, Rousseau, Voltaire, Condillac, Helvetius, beaming\r\nlike rising meteors in the dark firmament, and shedding a fearful gleam on\r\nthe past, the present, and the future; boldly tracking a path once trodden\r\nwith groping steps by Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, and Gassendi![1] No longer\r\ntrusting in blind confidence to the scholastic rules of those dignitaries\r\nof science whose conclusions were considered sufficient to command our\r\nfaith, man became sceptical and positive; doubt and disbelief were carried\r\ninto every investigation; the reign of _prestiges_ was over; the former\r\nmonopolists of power and of science, the two great levers of society (the\r\nmore effective since their fulcra rested on timidity and ignorance), were\r\nthrown from their antiquated stand, and found themselves brought face to\r\nface in explanatory contact with their once all-believing and obedient\r\npupils, but now become a neoteric generation;--the crown and the sceptre,\r\nthe cap and the gown, were baubles in their eyes. When the faculty of\r\nreasoning was not able to prevail, the shafts of ridicule were drawn from\r\nthe quiver of philosophic wit, and inflicted rankling wounds where they\r\ncould not destroy. Ancient systems were exploded with ancient prejudices,\r\ntheories were overthrown with dynasties, and doctrines with\r\ngovernments;--one might have imagined that the formidable power of steam\r\nhad been communicated to the mind, illustrating the words of Milton,\r\n\r\n  The mind is its own place, and in itself\r\n  Can make a heaven of hell, and hell of heaven.\r\n\r\nScience, now aimed at generalization-the physiologist, the chemist, became\r\nlegislators, stepping from the academic chair to the senatorial seat, and\r\nfrom teaching how to benefit mankind they hurried to destroy, forgetful,\r\nin their ambitious dream, of the noble encomium of Cicero, \"_Homines ad\r\ndeos nulla se proprius accedunt, quam salutem hominibus dando_.\"\r\n\r\nPhilosophy and the study of medicine were now inseparable; this generous\r\nscience was not to be attained in books only, but in the study of mankind.\r\nRousseau thus spoke of physicians when writing to Bernardin de Saint\r\nPierre:--\"_Il n'y a pas d'etat qui exige plus d'etude que le leur; par\r\ntous les pays, ce sont des hommes les plus veritablement savans et\r\nutiles_.\" Voltaire was of a similar opinion when he thus expressed\r\nhimself:--\"_Il n'est rien de plus estimable au monde, qu'un medecin qui,\r\nayant dans sa jeunesse etudie la nature, connu les ressorts du corps\r\nhumain, les maux qui le tourmentent, les remedes qui peuvent le soulager,\r\nexerce son etat en s'en defiant, et soigne egalement les pauvres et les\r\nriches_.\"\r\n\r\nHow came it then that these great observers did not partake of the\r\nprejudices of Montaigne, Moliere, and other writers, who invariably\r\nstigmatized the practice of physic? simply because it was no longer a\r\ndogmatic profession exercised with scholastic pedantry, but a science\r\nfounded on the study of nature, and the immutable laws of sound\r\nphilosophy. Although a classic education forms an indispensable part of a\r\nphysician's education, yet it is in more important pursuits that his\r\nexperience should be obtained: the knowledge of ancient languages is\r\nprincipally useful in discovering the errors of the olden writers, and in\r\ndetecting the barefaced plagiarisms of the moderns.\r\n\r\nMuch valuable time, however, may be lost in the pursuit of ancient lore;\r\nand Montaigne has justly observed, \"There are books which should only be\r\nread, but others that must be learnt.\" This discrimination is of the\r\nutmost importance; for it may be said of the bookworm's library,\r\n\"_Multitudo librorum saepe est nubes testium ignorantiae possessoris_.\"\r\nAristippus very properly replied to a man who boasted of his reading, \"It\r\nis not those who eat the most that are hale and healthy, but those who can\r\nbest digest.\" Hence the distinction that arose between the philosophical\r\nphysician and the dogmatizer. The one was guided by the observation of\r\nfacts, the other by glossarial records. Men of erudition are seldom men of\r\ngenius. The exploring mind is ever anxious to take flight from the\r\nprison-house of scholastic restraints. Scepticism, moreover, is frequently\r\nthe result of deep study, which leads the neophyte into such a labyrinth\r\nof conflicting opinions, that decision and conviction are not easily\r\nattained. Laugier, a most learned German physician, had no faith in his\r\nprofession: being reproached with his incredulity, he replied, \"_Credo,\r\nDomine, adjuva incredulitatem meam_.\"\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations lead to an important, and at the same time a\r\npainful reflection. Will this rapid intellectual progress tend ultimately\r\nto meliorate the condition of mankind? Nations have been compared to Man:\r\nhaving once reached the acme of prosperity and strength, their vigour like\r\nhis gradually declines. History offers nothing more than a chronicle of\r\nsuch facts. Whatever may be the causes of this degeneracy, is a matter\r\nforeign to my present subject; although I may be permitted to observe by\r\nthe way, that it may have arisen from the great disparity and inequality\r\nin the condition of society that tends to lull the wealthy into apathetic\r\nindifference and blind security in their power, while it urges the poor\r\nand the bold to rapine and destructive deeds. This perilous state can only\r\ncease to exist when general education is improved: if this most important\r\nsource of real prosperity is attended to, we perhaps need not seek in\r\nparticular events, gloomy anticipations of the future.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the destinies of nations in the wreck of empires and the\r\ndestruction of men, the philosopher calmly seated on ruins that often\r\n\"speak that sometime they were a worthy building,\" reflects with pride\r\nthat science has withstood the withering hand of time. It is true, that in\r\nevery study errors have been heaped upon errors; but truth will often\r\nresult from falsehood, and doubt that brings on investigation, leads to\r\ncomparative certainty. Locke has justly observed, that the faculty of\r\nreasoning seldom or never deceives those who trust to it: its\r\nconsequences, from what it builds on, are evident and certain; but that\r\nwhich it oftenest, if not only, misleads us in, is, that the principles\r\nfrom which we conclude, the grounds upon which we bottom our reasoning,\r\nare but a part--_something_ is left out which should go into the reckoning\r\nto make it just and exact. This _something_ is the constant pursuit of the\r\nphilosopher. The name of a country may be obliterated from a map, the\r\ndeeds of heroes be effaced from the annals of the world; the pursuit of\r\ntruth can only cease when man is no more;--its light may be veiled by\r\nignorance, craft, or cupidity,--but it cannot be extinguished. The cities\r\nthat gave birth to the illustrious philosophers of old have long ceased to\r\nexist, yet the immortal works of those sages that have escaped the\r\nravages of time, are still as fresh and luxuriant as when their glorious\r\noratory enchanted and captivated their disciples' ears.\r\n\r\nNo science has been cultivated with more difficulty than that of Medicine.\r\nThe following papers will show how fearfully it has had to contend in turn\r\nwith the power of priestcraft, that sought to monopolize its practice, as\r\na privilege from the gods, and with the furious opposition of contemporary\r\nmembers of the profession, whose cupidity and vanity were alarmed by the\r\nintroduction of novel doctrines, which they were too old, too busy, or too\r\nobstinate to learn. The extracts from Medical Literature that I have given\r\nwill show that most of our modern notions were known to the earliest\r\nwriters, and were only improved in succeeding ages, as in like manner our\r\npresent doctrines will in all probability be advanced by future\r\ngenerations. The destruction of kingdoms and of chronicles, the inroads of\r\nbarbarism,--the more destructive inroads of ignorance and bigotry, have\r\nnot been able to produce a void in the world of science; the catenation of\r\nphilosophic inquiry has never been broken in its connexions. Oppression\r\nonly riveted the chain more firmly, as if to resist the united power of\r\nman and time. Adversity, which\r\n\r\n  Like the toad, ugly and venomous,\r\n  Wears yet a precious jewel in its head,\r\n\r\nhas always been considered the best school of practical wisdom: and it is\r\nthus that, amidst the portentous events which have shaken every\r\ninstitution, and which perhaps still menace further dissolution, the fane\r\nof science has oftentimes been more vividly illumined by the surrounding\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nThe evils that desolate society too frequently arise from the hasty acts\r\nof intemperate men, who deem it necessary to meet the tumultuous demands\r\nof the multitude with decided and energetic, but, at the same time,\r\nperilous measures: the progress of science, on the contrary, is gradual,\r\nand of course more likely to be eventually permanent. While political\r\nspeculations are daily becoming more uncertain in their operations, the\r\ntriumph of intellectual superiority over prejudice is every where\r\napparent;--unjust disabilities are being abolished, and the gates of\r\nlearning thrown open to every candidate, whatever may be his religious or\r\nhis political tenets.\r\n\r\nIn our country, more than in any other, industry and perseverance have\r\never had a fairer chance of attaining social pre-eminence, despite the\r\nshackles imposed upon the candidate for fame by institutions framed in the\r\ndarker ages. What then may we not expect, when we behold the bright era\r\nthat opens before us,--when exclusive institutions will be considered the\r\nobsolete remnants of expiring bigotry and intolerance! May we not indulge\r\nin the most sanguine hope, that our former glories are only the historic\r\nearnest of still more glorious days? If the spirit of the immortal Locke\r\ncould hover over our earth, he would feel, with some degree of pride, that\r\nhis admonitions have not been unheeded; and that \"those who live mewed up\r\nwithin their own contracted territories, and will not look abroad beyond\r\nthe boundaries that _chance_, _conceit_, or _laziness_ have set to their\r\ninquiries, but live separate from the notions, discourses, and attainments\r\nof the rest of mankind,\" have at last felt the necessity of yielding to\r\nthe voice of reason, or rather of their own welfare.\r\n\r\nIn the following work I merely rank myself as a compiler. I have only\r\nsketched--sometimes perhaps with too fanciful a pencil, subjects of great\r\nimportance, which, by being thus rendered popular, may induce abler pens\r\nto imbody them in a more permanent form. The variety of matter introduced\r\nhas obliged me to be discursive, and to have recourse to some repetitions\r\nthat were necessary to illustrate subjects not easily abridged. Whenever I\r\nhave held up errors and evil passions to exposure, I have not, in one\r\nsingle instance, I trust, been influenced by any hostility towards men or\r\nparties--ranks or creeds. If I have unwillingly and unwittingly given\r\noffence, I shall most sincerely lament it. My materials have been gleaned\r\nfrom the works of many contemporaries, whose well-known and\r\njustly-appreciated names will in general appear: but I should be wanting\r\nin candour, did I not avow that I have derived much valuable information\r\nfrom _Le Dictionnaire des Sciences Medicales_, an elaborate compilation,\r\ncontaining more \"CURIOSITIES OF MEDICAL EXPERIENCE\" than any existing\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n  _48, Eaton Square,\r\n  January, 1837._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            Page\r\n\r\n  Obesity

EXPERIENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOBESITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious are the opinions concerning the cause of excessive corpulence. By\r\nsome it is attributed to too great an activity in the digestive functions,\r\nproducing a rapid assimilation of our food; by others, to the predominance\r\nof the liver: while indolence and apathy, such as is commonly observed in\r\nthe wealthy monastic orders, are considered as occasioning a laxity of\r\nfibre favourable to this _embonpoint_. Boileau has thus described one of\r\nthese fat lazy prelates, who\r\n\r\n            Muni d'un dejeuner,\r\n  Dormant d'un leger somme, attendait le diner.\r\n  La jeunesse en sa fleur brille sur son visage;\r\n  Son menton sur son sein descend a triple etage;\r\n  Et son corps ramasse, dans sa courte grosseur,\r\n  Fait gemir les coussins sous sa molle epaisseur.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that exercise, anxiety of mind, want of sleep, and spare\r\nfood, are circumstances opposed to fatness. This fact is illustrated by\r\nShakspeare, when Caesar says to Antony,\r\n\r\n  Let me have men about me that are fat,--\r\n  Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights;\r\n  Yon Cassius has a lean and hungry look,\r\n  He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.\r\n\r\nAntony and Dolabella were both men of some corpulence. The Roman ladies\r\ndreaded above all things too voluminous a development of the bosom: to\r\nprevent it they were in the habit of applying to their breasts the raw\r\nflesh of a fish called Angel. Hippocrates has maintained that obesity was\r\nan obstacle to conception. This assertion which was partaken by other\r\nmedical writers, may, in some measure account for the dread of\r\ncorpulence. Strange indeed have been the fancies on this subject amongst\r\nvarious nations.\r\n\r\nFat is a fluid similar to vegetable oils, inodorous, and lighter than\r\nwater; besides the elements common to water, to oils, and wax, it contains\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, and sebacic acid, which is pretty similar to the acetic.\r\nHuman fat, like that of other animals, has been frequently employed for\r\nvarious purposes. A story is told of an Irish tallowchandler, who, during\r\nthe invasion of Cromwell's army, made candles with the fat of Englishmen,\r\nwhich were remarkable for their good quality; but when the times became\r\nmore tranquil, his goods were of an inferior kind, and when one of his\r\ncustomers complained of his candles falling off, he apologised by saying,\r\n\"I am sorry to inform you that the times are so bad that I have been short\r\nof Englishmen for a long time.\"\r\n\r\nObesity may be considered a serious evil, and has exposed corpulent\r\npersons to many _desagremens_. The ancients held fat people in sovereign\r\ncontempt. Some of the Gentoos enter their dwellings by a hole in the roof;\r\nand any fat person who cannot get through it, they consider as an\r\nexcommunicated offender who has not been able to rid himself of his sins.\r\nAn Eastern prince had an officer to regulate the size of his subjects, and\r\nwho dieted the unwieldy ones to reduce them to a proper volume. In China\r\nthis calamity is considered a blessing, a man's intellectual qualities are\r\nesteemed in the ratio of corporeal bulk.\r\n\r\nThere are cases on record among ourselves where unwieldiness led to\r\nestimation. The corpulent antiquarian Grose was requested by his butcher\r\nto tell all his friends that he bought his meat from him; and the paviers\r\nof Cambridge used to say, \"God bless you, sir!\" to a huge professor when\r\nhe walked over their work. Fatness has often been the butt of jocularity.\r\nDr. Stafford, who was enormously fat, was honoured with this epitaph:\r\n\r\n  Take heed, O good traveller, and do not tread hard,\r\n  For here lies Dr. Stafford, _in all this church-yard_.\r\n\r\nAnd the following lines were inscribed on the tomb of a corpulent\r\nchandler:\r\n\r\n  Here lies in earth an honest fellow,\r\n  Who died by fat and lived by tallow.\r\n\r\nDr. Beddoes was so uncomfortably stout that a lady of Clifton used to\r\ncall him \"the walking feather-bed.\" At the court of Louis XV. there were\r\ntwo lusty noblemen, related to each other: the king, having rallied one of\r\nthem on his corpulency, added, \"I suppose you take little or no exercise?\"\r\n\"Your majesty will pardon me,\" replied the bulky duke, \"for I generally\r\nwalk two or three times round my cousin every morning.\"\r\n\r\nVarious ludicrous anecdotes are related of fat people. A scene between\r\nMrs. Clive and Mrs. Pritchard, two corpulent actresses, must have been\r\nvery amusing. They were playing in the parts of Lady Easy and Edging, in\r\nthe Careless Husband, when the former desires Edging to pick up a letter\r\nshe had dropped; and Mrs. Clive, who might as well have attempted to raise\r\na hundred pound weight, exclaimed, \"Not I indeed, take it up yourself if\r\nyou like it.\" This answer threw the audience into roars of laughter, when\r\nMrs. Pritchard replied, \"Well, if you won't take up the letter, I must\r\nfind some one who will;\" and so saying, she beckoned to a servant in the\r\nwing, who came forward and terminated the dispute.\r\n\r\nIn some countries, especially in the East, moderate obesity is considered\r\na beauty, and Tunisene young ladies are regularly fattened for marriage; a\r\ndifferent practice from that of the Roman matrons, who starved their\r\ndaughters, to make them as lean as possible on such occasions. Thus\r\nTerence,\r\n\r\n    Nostrae virgines--si bono habitu sunt, matres pugiles esse aiunt, et\r\n    cibum deducunt.\r\n\r\nErasmus states that the Gordii carried their admiration for corpulence to\r\nsuch an extent, that they raised the fattest amongst them to the throne.\r\nIt is well known that the preposterous size of some of the Hottentots is\r\ndeemed a perfection, and one of their Venuses was not long since exhibited\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that food materially influences this condition of\r\nmankind, although we frequently see enormous eaters who are miserably\r\nlean, and fat persons whose diet is most scanty. During the late war, a\r\nravenous French prisoner was known to eat four pounds of raw cow-udder,\r\nten pounds of raw beef, and two pounds of candles, per diem, diluting his\r\nmeals with five quarts of porter; yet this carnivorous brute was a perfect\r\nskeleton.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many predisposing causes of obesity we may rank emasculation.\r\nAn epicurean fishmonger of the name of Samuel Tull performed this\r\noperation on fishes, to render them more delicate. His curious experiments\r\nwere submitted to the Royal Society. The same practice has been\r\nsubsequently illustrated by Professor Dumeril. Father Charleroix informs\r\nus that Caraib cannibals had recourse to this process to fatten their\r\nprisoners before they were devoured.\r\n\r\nAnatomical pursuits are also known to occasion _embonpoint_. This has been\r\nfrequently observed amongst medical pupils. Professor Mascagni attributed\r\nhis corpulence to his constant attendance on dissections; he also excused\r\nhis amorous propensities on similar grounds.\r\n\r\nFor the cure of corpulency, diminution of food of a nutritious nature has\r\nbeen generally recommended; added to this, little sleep and much exercise\r\nare advised. Acids to reduce fatness are frequently administered, but have\r\ndone considerable mischief. Amongst other wonderful accounts of their\r\nefficacy in such cases, it is related of a Spanish general who was of an\r\nenormous size, that he drank vinegar until his bulk was so reduced that he\r\ncould fold his skin round his body.\r\n\r\nFor a similar purpose soap has been frequently recommended, particularly\r\nby Dr. Flemyng. He began this experiment with one of his patients who\r\nweighed twenty stone and eleven pounds (jockey weight): in July 1754, he\r\ntook every night a quarter of an ounce of common Castile soap. In August\r\n1756 his bulk was reduced two stone, and in 1760 he was brought down to a\r\nproper condition.\r\n\r\nDarwin is of opinion that salt and salted meat are still more efficacious\r\nthan soap. All these experiments, however, are in general not only useless\r\nbut pernicious, and frequently prove fatal. Mr. Wadd, from whose curious\r\nwork on corpulence much is extracted in this article, properly observes\r\nthat, \"certain and permanent relief is only to be sought in rigid\r\nabstemiousness, and a strict and constant attention to diet and exercise.\"\r\nDr. Cheyne, who weighed thirty-two stone, reduced himself one-third, and\r\nenjoyed good health till the age of seventy-two. Numerous instances of the\r\nkind are mentioned, where journals of gradual reduction were kept: the\r\nfollowing is an abstract of one of them, in the case of a person who, on\r\nthe 17th June 1820, weighed twenty-three stone two pounds:--\r\n\r\n  June 17           23 stone 2 pounds.\r\n  July 27           21   \"  10   \"\r\n  September 10      20   \"   7   \"\r\n  October 10        19   \"   3   \"\r\n  November 10       18   \"  11   \"\r\n  December 10       18   \"   4   \"\r\n  December 25       18   \"   1   \"\r\n\r\nIn another case, attended by Dr. Gregory of Edinburgh, the patient weighed\r\ntwenty-three stone, and by a regular system of diet was brought down to\r\nfifteen stone. In this instance brown bread, with a certain quantity of\r\nbran in it, was employed; and it is well known that the alimentary\r\nsecretions are materially altered by the quality of bread. The article of\r\ndrink also requires much attention. Corpulent persons generally indulge to\r\nexcess, and in this case, every endeavour to reduce them will be vain. We\r\nfrequently see our jockeys reducing themselves to the extent of a stone\r\nand a half in the week. A lower scale of diet is by no means as injurious\r\nas it is generally supposed; the English prisoners made by Tippoo Saib,\r\nthough kept upon a scanty pittance of bread and water, found themselves in\r\nbetter health than before, and some of them were cured during their\r\ncaptivity of liver complaints of long and severe duration.\r\n\r\nOne of the most corpulent persons known was Mr. Lambert, of\r\nLeicestershire, who weighed fifty-two stone eleven pounds (14 lbs. to the\r\nstone).\r\n\r\nAt Hainton, there died in 1816, Samuel Sugars, aged fifty-two; and his\r\nbody, with a single coffin weighed fifty stone.\r\n\r\nIn 1754 died Mr. Jacob Powell, of Stebbing in Essex: his body was above\r\nfive yards in circumference, and weighed five hundred and sixty pounds;\r\nrequiring sixteen men to bear him to his grave.\r\n\r\nIn 1775 Mr. Spooner, of Skillington near Tamworth, weighed, a short time\r\nbefore his death, forty stone and nine pounds, and measured four feet\r\nthree inches across the shoulders.\r\n\r\nKeysler mentions a young man in Lincoln who ate eighteen pounds of beef\r\ndaily, and died in 1724, in the twenty-eighth of his age, weighing five\r\nhundred and thirty pounds.\r\n\r\nA baker, in Pye Corner, weighed thirty-four stone, and would frequently\r\neat a small shoulder of mutton, baked in his oven, and weighing five\r\npounds; he, however, persisted for one year to live upon water-gruel and\r\nbrown bread, by which he lost two hundred pounds of his bulk.\r\n\r\nMr. Collet, master of the Evesham Academy, weighed upwards of twenty-six\r\nstone; when twelve years old, he was nearly as large as at the time of his\r\ndeath. At two years of age he required two nurses to lift him in and out\r\nof bed, one of whom in a fit of anger he felled to the floor with a blow\r\nof his hand.\r\n\r\nAt Trenaw in Cornwall, there was a man, known by the name of Grant\r\nChillcot, who weighed four hundred and sixty pounds; one of his stockings\r\ncould contain six gallons of wheat.\r\n\r\nOur poet Butler must have met with some such enormous creatures in the\r\ntype of his Saxon Duke, who, in Hudibras,\r\n\r\n  ------did grow so fat,\r\n  That mice (as histories relate)\r\n  Ate grots and labyrinths to dwell in\r\n  His postique parts, without his feeling.\r\n\r\nIf obesity has been the subject of ungenerous jokes, leanness has not\r\npassed unnoticed. An anecdote is related of a reverend doctor of a very\r\nghostly appearance, who was one day accosted by a fellow with the\r\nfollowing salutation: \"Well, doctor, I hope you have taken care of your\r\n_soul_?\" \"Why, my friend?\" said the divine. \"Because,\" replied the\r\nimpertinent interlocutor, \"your _body_ is not worth caring for.\"\r\n\r\nA poor diminutive Frenchman being ordered by his Sangrado to drink a quart\r\nof ptisan a day, replied, with a heavy sigh, \"Alas! doctor, that I cannot\r\ndo, since I only hold a pint.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Duke de Choiseuil, a remarkably meager man, came to London to\r\nnegotiate a peace, Charles Townshend being asked whether the French\r\ngovernment had sent the preliminaries of a treaty, answered, \"He did not\r\nknow, but they had sent the _outline of an ambassador_.\"\r\n\r\nThat change of spare diet to a more nutritious food may bring on some\r\ncorpulence, is evidenced in an anecdote of Colly Cibber, who relates that\r\na poor half-starved actor, who used to play the Apothecary in Romeo and\r\nJuliet, to the life, and with great applause, received an augmentation of\r\nsalary in consequence of his popularity. Unfortunately, increase of\r\nwealth led him to increase his fare, until he gradually assumed a\r\nplumpness which unfitted him for the worn-out pharmacopolist; and not\r\nbeing able to perform in any other line, the poor man was discharged.\r\nHowever, poverty once more brought him down to his original condition,\r\nwhen he reappeared upon the boards as triumphantly as ever.\r\n\r\nIf _embonpoint_ is generally a sign of good-humour and a cheerful\r\ndisposition, leanness frequently betokens a sour, crabbed, and ill-natured\r\ncharacter. Solomon has said, \"A merry heart doeth good like medicine; but\r\na broken spirit drieth the bones.\" This observation, however, cannot be\r\nconsidered a rule in forming a judgment of various tempers. This is by no\r\nmeans an easy attempt in our intercourse with the world, when physiognomy\r\nis not always a sure guide in the selection of our companions. Dr.\r\nFranklin tells a singular story on this subject:\r\n\r\n\"An old philosophical gentleman had grown, from experience, very cautious\r\nin avoiding ill-natured people. To endeavour to ascertain their\r\ndisposition he made use of his legs, one of which was remarkably handsome,\r\nthe other, by some accident, crooked and deformed. If a stranger at the\r\nfirst interview regarded his ugly leg more than his handsome one, he\r\ndoubted him; but if he spoke of it, and took no notice of his handsome\r\nleg, that was sufficient to determine the philosopher to have no further\r\nacquaintance with him. Every body has not this two-legged instrument; but\r\nevery one, with a little attention, may observe signs of this carping,\r\nfault-finding disposition, and take the same resolution of avoiding the\r\nacquaintance of those infected by it. I therefore advise those querulous,\r\ndiscontented, unhappy people, if they wish to be respected and beloved by\r\nothers, and happy in themselves, _to leave off looking at the ugly leg_.\"\r\n\r\nVarious expedients, in addition to a better diet, have been resorted to,\r\nto restore lean persons to a better case; but amongst the most singular\r\nthat we have on record is that of flagellation. Galen says, that\r\nhorse-dealers having been observed to fatten horses for sale by flogging\r\nthem, an analogous method might be useful with spare persons who wish to\r\nbecome stouter. He also mentions slave-dealers who employed similar means.\r\nSuetonius informs us that Musa, the favourite physician of Augustus, used\r\nto fustigate him, not only to cure him of a sciatica, but to keep him\r\nplump. Meibomius pretends that nurses whip little children to fatten them,\r\nthat they may appear healthy and chubby to their mothers. No doubt but\r\nflagellation determines a greater influx of blood to the surface, and may\r\nthus tend to increase the circulation, and give tone to parts which would\r\notherwise be languid. With this intention, _urticatio_, or whipping with\r\nnettles, has been frequently used in medical practice with great\r\nadvantage. Xenophon thawed his frozen soldiers by flagellation. In amorous\r\ndespondency and grief, Coelius Aurelianus recommended this process, and\r\nElidoeus Paduanus advises it to bring out tardy eruptions. The most\r\nsingular effect of this castigation is recorded by Meibomius, in his work\r\n_De flagrorum usu_, &c., dedicated to a councillor of the Bishop of\r\nLubeck, with the following epigraph:\r\n\r\n  Delicias pariunt Veneri crudelia flagra.\r\n    Dum nocet, illa juvat; dum juvat, ecce nocet.\r\n\r\nMenghus Faventinus had long before extolled this practice, mentioned also\r\nby Coelius Rhodiginus, and various ancient writers, and more recently\r\nrecognised as effectual by Rousseau, in his Confessions.\r\n\r\nA remarkable case of leanness is mentioned by Lorry in a priest, who\r\nbecame so thin and dry in all his articulations, that at last he was\r\nunable to go through the celebration of mass, as his joints and spine\r\nwould crack in so loud and strange a manner at every genuflexion, that the\r\nfaithful were terrified, and the faithless laughed. One of these miserable\r\nlaths once undertook a long journey to consult a learned physician on his\r\nsad condition, and having begged to know, in a most piteous tone, the\r\ncause of his desiccation, was favoured with the following luminous answer:\r\n\"Sir, there is a predisposition in your constitution to make you lean, and\r\na disposition in your constitution to keep you so.\" Another meager patient\r\nbeing told that the celebrated Hunter had fattened a dog by removing his\r\nspleen, exclaimed, with a deep sigh, \"O, sir! I wish Mr. Hunter had\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDWARFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely believe that the ancients gave any credence to the\r\nfabulous accounts of dwarfish nations, or could be persuaded of the\r\nexistence of those pigmies spoken of by Aristotle and other writers, who,\r\nin all probability, described as such a species of diminutive monkeys.\r\n\r\nAthenaeus mentions a race of dwarfs who were in perpetual war with cranes,\r\nwho harnessed partridges to their chariots, and were obliged to cut down\r\ncorn with felling-axes, like forest trees. Pliny asserts that their\r\nconstant enemy, the crane, drove them out of Thracia, but that they still\r\nwere to be met with in Ethiopia, near the source of the Nile, and above\r\nthe rise of the Ganges, where they were named _Spithania_, their stature\r\nnot exceeding three palms. Nicephorus Calixtus, in his Ecclesiastical\r\nHistory, mentions an Egyptian who was not longer than a partridge, and\r\nwho, at the age of twenty-five, displayed considerable mental endowment.\r\nStrabo, however, judiciously observed that these stories arose from the\r\ncircumstance of the small size of every animal in intemperate regions.\r\nVarious modern travellers have recorded the most absurd stories of\r\ndiminutive men, as well as of gigantic nations; but to most of them we may\r\napply the words of Congreve--\r\n\r\n  Fernandez Mendez Pinto was but a type of thee,\r\n  Thou liar of the first magnitude.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless true, that man exhibits differences of stature in\r\nvarious climes. The Laplanders and Samoides in Europe, the Ostiacks and\r\nTungooses in Asia, the Greenlanders and Esquimaux in America--all the\r\nnatives indeed of high northern latitudes are remarkably short, measuring\r\nlittle more than four feet; and Niels Sara, the Laplander mentioned by Von\r\nBuch in his Travels, and who measured five feet eight inches, may be\r\nconsidered as a gigantic exception. It had been reported by travellers,\r\nthat a nation of white dwarfs, called _Quimos_ or _Kimos_, existed in the\r\ninterior of Madagascar; but Flacourt has positively denied the fact,\r\nalthough Commerson, the naturalist of Bougainville, and De Modave, confirm\r\nthe former statement. It has also been remarked by various travellers,\r\nthat dwarfs are not uncommon amongst robust and manly races, instanced in\r\nPoland and Lithuania. Sigismund de Herbestein made the same observation in\r\nSamogitia, the population of which was of a high stature.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means evident that climate or any external agency invariably\r\nproduces this effect; for, in the very regions inhabited by the stunted\r\nHottentot, the shortest race in Africa, since the Bosjernan tribe scarcely\r\never exceed four feet, we find the strong and tall Kaffer. Amongst these\r\nit is also to be remarked, that there exists a singular difference between\r\nthe sexes. Langsdorf thus expresses himself on the subject: \"The Kaffer\r\nwomen were mostly of low stature, very strong-limbed, and particularly\r\nmuscular in the leg: the men, on the contrary, were the finest figures I\r\never beheld; they were tall, robust, and muscular. A young man of about\r\ntwenty, of six feet ten inches high, was one of the finest figures that\r\nperhaps was ever created. He was a perfect Hercules; and a cast from his\r\nbody would not have disgraced the pedestal of the deity in the Farnese\r\nPalace.\" He further adds, \"There is, perhaps, no nation on earth, taken\r\ncollectively, that can produce so fine a race of men as the Kaffers: they\r\nare tall, stout, muscular, well-made, elegant figures. They are exempt,\r\nindeed, from many of those causes that in more civilized societies\r\ncontribute to impede the growth of the body. Their diet is simple, their\r\nexercise of a salutary nature; their body is neither cramped nor\r\nencumbered by clothing; the air they breathe is pure; their rest is not\r\ndisturbed by violent love, nor their minds ruffled by jealousy; they are\r\nfree from those licentious appetites which proceed frequently more from a\r\ndepraved imagination than a real natural want. Their frame is neither\r\nshaken nor enervated by the use of intoxicating liquor; they eat when\r\nhungry, and sleep when nature demands it. With such a kind of life,\r\nlanguor and melancholy have nothing to do. The countenance of a Kaffer is\r\nalways cheerful, and the whole of his demeanour bespeaks content and peace\r\nof mind.\"\r\n\r\nAre diminutive races more productive than those of stronger formation? The\r\nbrute creation has been taken as an example in support of this opinion;\r\nlarge animals producing one or two young ones, while the smaller species\r\nare singularly prolific. The lioness seldom brings forth more than two or\r\nfour whelps, the cat will have a litter of eight or ten kittens; the\r\npullulation of insects is incredible. But is not this circumstance an\r\nillustration of the wisdom of Providence? If the larger species were as\r\nabundant as the lesser races, where could they find sustenance in regions\r\nwhere the produce is, under the influence of the seasons, occasionally\r\nabundant or scarce? In the ocean, this is not the case; the myriads of its\r\ncreatures suffice to support each other, and we therefore meet in the\r\ndeep, the largest of animals in numerous shoals, while the small fry are\r\ngenerated in marvellous abundance.\r\n\r\nThat the facility of obtaining food and the nature of the nutritious\r\nsubstances that animals may find, influence their stature, is evident. In\r\nsandy and arid plains poor in pasture, we find horses and cattle of a\r\nstunted breed: the herds of Flanders widely differ from those of Wales and\r\nof the Ukraine, and the Scotch and Welsh cattle cannot be compared to\r\nthose of Holstein. At the same time, it must be observed, that in regard\r\nto dwarfs, although it frequently does occur that they are labouring under\r\na hereditary lowness of stature, this is not invariably the case. In these\r\ninstances dwarfs may be considered as morbid phenomena. Thus Bebe, the\r\ndwarf of Stanislaus of Poland, who was thirty-three French inches high,\r\nwas weak, of delicate health, became deformed as he grew up, and died at\r\nthe age of twenty-three; his parents were of the usual stature: whereas\r\nthe Polish nobleman Borwlaski was well-made, active, intelligent: he\r\nmeasured twenty-eight inches; he had a brother of thirty-four inches, and\r\na sister of twenty-one. Stoeberin, of Nuerenberg, was nearly three feet high\r\nat twenty, well-proportioned, and possessing a cultivated mind: his\r\nparents, brothers, and sisters, were all dwarfs. Such natural dwarfs have\r\nbeen known to evince brilliant qualities. Uladislas, king of Poland,\r\nsurnamed _Cubitalis_ from his only measuring a cubit in height, was\r\nrenowned for his warlike exploits; and we find a dwarf of the name of\r\nKasan, a khan of Tartary, boldly leading their enterprising bands. These\r\nindividuals sprung from dwarfish parents; whereas the dwarfs we generally\r\nmeet with are deformities of nature; their head is voluminous, their\r\nintellectual faculties obtuse, they are mostly childish in their ideas and\r\npursuits, and are rarely able to propagate their race.\r\n\r\nHeld in contempt by the people, dwarfs naturally become peevish and\r\nirritable; and the diminutive names given to them to match their apparent\r\nnatural imperfection tend constantly to increase their irritability. Thus\r\nthe Latins called them _Homunciones_, the Italians _Piccoluomini_, the\r\nFlemings _Mennekin_,--whence, no doubt, our term _Mannikin_ given to\r\nlittle men, and _Minikin_ applied to small pins. A very curious case of a\r\ndwarf born from parents of the usual stature was exhibited in Paris in\r\n1819: her name was Anne Souvray; she was born in the Vosges, and was only\r\nthirty-three inches in height. She was at that period seventy-three years\r\nof age; was gay, animated, good-humoured, and danced with tolerable grace\r\nwith her sister Barbe, seventy-five years of age, and taller than her by\r\ntwo inches. In 1762, King Stanislaus wanted to marry her to his Bebe; the\r\nbridegroom, however, did not live to contract so desirable a match; but,\r\nfaithful to her lover, she ever afterwards called herself _Madame Bebe_.\r\n\r\nJeffrey Hudson, the dwarf of King Charles, must also have been of a very\r\ndiminutive stature, since we find that he was served up in a pie to the\r\nroyal table, and jumped out when the crust was raised. It appears that\r\nintroducing live pies in those days were not an uncommon frolic; hence\r\nthere may be some truth in the old song of\r\n\r\n  Four-and-twenty black-birds bak'd in a pye,\r\n  When the pye was open'd the birds began to sing,\r\n  Was not that a dainty dish to lay before a king?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIGANTIC RACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile we dismiss as fabulous all ancient and modern accounts of dwarfish\r\nraces, we must also treat with the same scepticism the relations of\r\ngigantic nations. Although individuals of incredible stature have been\r\noccasionally seen, the word giant must be considered not only comparative\r\nas regarding primary races, but in many instances allegorical. Thus the\r\nHebrew word, _Nophel_ and _Giboor_ (_Nephilim_ and _Gibborim_ in the\r\nplural), did not signify giants, as commonly translated, but cruel and\r\nviolent men. Athletic power and uncommon energies were naturally\r\nassociated with the idea of supernatural stature, though intellectual\r\naccomplishments were not always included in the association: on the\r\ncontrary, we find the ancient axiom _Homo longus rare sapiens_ frequently\r\nadduced.\r\n\r\nIn temperate climates the height of the human race averages from four feet\r\nand a half to six feet, but occasional instances have been met with of men\r\nreaching eight and nine feet--nay, some authors go so far as ten and\r\neighteen; but the latter assertions seem to refer to fossil bones\r\nattributed to man, but which evidently belonged to other animals. Buffon\r\nmentions gigantic human bones discovered at Lucerne, but which upon\r\nexamination Blumenbach pronounced to be the remains of an elephant.\r\nHalicot, in his work called _Gigantosteologia_, describes bones found in a\r\nsepulchre in Dauphiny over which was a stone inscribed TEUTOBOCCHUS REX:\r\nthis skeleton was twenty-five feet and a half high, and ten feet broad at\r\nthe shoulder. Riolan, the celebrated anatomist, disputes the fact; and in\r\nhis book entitled _Gigantomachia_ positively affirms that they also\r\nbelonged to an elephant. It is worthy of remark, that in this controversy\r\neach party considered his opinion and decision of sufficient weight to\r\nneed no illustration, and therefore neither of them thought it necessary\r\nto confirm his _dixit_ by drawings and engravings of the questionable\r\nremains. Such is the vanity of the learned! An infallible philosopher\r\ninforms us that Adam's stature was one hundred and twenty-three feet nine\r\ninches; Eve's, one hundred and eighteen feet nine inches and three\r\nquarters; Noah's, twenty feet short of Adam's; Abraham's, twenty-eight\r\nfeet; Moses', thirteen; and Hercules', ten.\r\n\r\nThat the first races of man were of larger dimensions than those of our\r\ncontemporaries, has ever been a general opinion. Thus Virgil in his\r\nGeorgics:\r\n\r\n  Grandiaque effossis mirabitur ossa sepulchris.\r\n\r\nLucretius ascribes the same superiority to animals.\r\n\r\n  Jamque adeo fracta est aetas, effoetaque tellus\r\n  Vix animalia parva creat, quae cuncta creavit\r\n  Saecla, deditque ferarum ingentia corpora partu.\r\n\r\nAnd again the Mantuan poet,\r\n\r\n                Sic Omnia fatis\r\n  In pejus ruere, ac retro sublapsa referri.\r\n\r\nNot only have our forefathers been considered more gigantic in stature,\r\nbut of more vigorous power. Hence Juvenal says,\r\n\r\n  Nam genus hoc, vivo jam decrescebat Homero.\r\n  Terra malos homines nunc educat, atque pusillos.\r\n\r\nIt is however obvious, that former races, although they might have\r\nexcelled the present generation in vigour from the nature of their\r\neducation and pursuits, could not claim any pre-eminence in stature. The\r\nremains of human bones, found in tombs and Egyptian mummies, demonstrate\r\nthis fact most clearly; and the armour, helmets, and breastplates of the\r\nancients confirm it. Their swords were as light, nay, much lighter in many\r\ninstances, than those of the present day; and those enormous ones of the\r\ntimes of chivalry were only wielded to inflict one overwhelming blow with\r\nboth hands, and could scarcely be recovered for protection.\r\n\r\nAncient writers corroborate this opinion. Homer, when speaking of a fine\r\nman, gives him four cubits in height and one in breadth. Vitruvius fixes\r\nthe usual standard of man at six Roman feet: the giant Gabbarus mentioned\r\nby Pliny did not exceed nine feet. Aristotle's admeasurement of beds was\r\nsix feet; and certainly the doorways of ancient edifices by no means\r\nindicated taller inmates than our present generation. It is therefore\r\npretty clear that the supposed fossil remains of gigantic human bones\r\nbelonged to the _Megatherium_, the _Palaeotherium_, and other individuals,\r\nwhich certainly prove that in remote ages there existed animals of much\r\nlarger dimensions than any now in being, though we have no reason to\r\nsuppose that this variety extended to our species.[2]\r\n\r\nThe origin of the fabled giants has led to marvellous disquisitions. Many\r\nfathers of the church, amongst whom we may quote St. Cyprian, St.\r\nAmbrosius, St. Chrosostom, St. Cyrillius, Tactantius, Tertullian, and\r\nseveral others, gravely maintain that giants were the favoured offsprings\r\nof holy maidens and angels. This may seem an impious conclusion, since the\r\ngigantic monsters of sacred history were any thing but angelic; for the\r\nCanaaneans, the Moabites, and the sons of Anak, descended from giants,\r\n(compared with whom the Israelites seemed as grasshoppers,) were most\r\nferocious, and their land devoured its inhabitants; (though Neuman gives a\r\ndifferent signification to the scriptural passage, which according to his\r\nparaphrase merely meant \"that the number of inhabitants was so great, that\r\nthey eat up all the land;\") Og, king of Bashan, whose country was\r\ndelivered into the hands of Israel, had an iron bedstead nine cubits in\r\nlength and four cubits in breadth; and Goliath, the reproach of Israel,\r\nwas six cubits and a span (which according to Cumberland makes eleven feet\r\nEnglish) in stature. It is therefore difficult to imagine why so many\r\nsaints considered giants as an angelic progeny.\r\n\r\nTo the present day, however, we find various races distinguished by their\r\nelevated stature. Humboldt says, that the Guayaquilists measure six feet\r\nand a half, and the Payaguas are equally tall, while the Caribbees of\r\nCumana are distinguished by their almost gigantic size from all the other\r\nnations he had met with in the New World. Hearne saw in the cold regions\r\nnorth of Canada individuals of six feet four inches. The Patagonians, or\r\nTehuels, were stated by Pigafitta and the Spanish early navigators as\r\nmeasuring seven feet four inches; and although it appears that this\r\naccount is exaggerated, more recent travellers, amongst whom we may name\r\nBougainville, Commodore Byron, Captain Wallis, Carteret, and Falkner,\r\naffirm that their height ranges from six to seven feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the best authenticated observations, it appears that the tallest\r\npersons on respectable record, did not, according to Haller, exceed nine\r\nfeet. A young man from Huntingdonshire was exhibited in London, and\r\nmeasured about eight feet at the age of seventeen; he was, as usual, born\r\nof the ordinary size, but began to grow most rapidly; his sister was of\r\ngreat height, and all his family were remarkably tall.\r\n\r\nDwarfs generally die from premature old age, and giants from exhaustion. A\r\ncurious instance of marvellous growth is recorded in a tract called\r\n\"_Prodigium Willinghamense_,\" or an account of a surprising boy who was\r\nborn at Willingham, near Cambridge, and upon whom the following epitaph\r\nwas written:--\"Stop, traveller, and wondering, know, here buried lie the\r\nremains of Thomas, son of Thomas and Margaret Hall; who, not one year old,\r\nhad the signs of manhood; at three, was almost four feet high, endued\r\nwith uncommon strength, a just proportion of parts, and a stupendous\r\nvoice; before six, he died as it were at an advanced age.\" Mr. Dawker, a\r\nsurgeon of St. Ives, Huntingdon, who published this account, viewed him\r\nafter death, and the corpse exhibited all the appearances of decrepit old\r\nage. This is a confirmation of the case of the boy of Salamis, mentioned\r\nby Pliny as being four feet high, and having reached puberty at the age of\r\nthree; and may also confirm the account of the man seen by Craterus, the\r\nbrother of Antigonus, who in seven years was an infant, a youth, an adult,\r\na father, an old man, and a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe experiment of Dr. Berkeley, bishop of Cloyne, to ascertain the\r\ninfluence of food in promoting extraordinary growth, is curious. He\r\nselected for this purpose an orphan child of the name of Macgrath; and, by\r\ndint of feeding, at the age of sixteen he had grown to the height of seven\r\nfeet; but his organization had been so exhausted by this forced process,\r\nthat he died in a state of moral and physical decay at the age of twenty.\r\n\r\nIn the development of organized bodies, the effects of light contribute\r\nmaterially. Dr. Edwards, an English physician in Paris, and one of our\r\nmost distinguished physiologists, has shown that by excluding tadpoles\r\nfrom the light, they will grow to double and triple their ordinary size,\r\nbut are not metamorphosed into frogs. He thinks that the _Proteus\r\nAnguinis_ is the first stage of an animal prevented from growing to\r\nperfection by inhabiting the subterraneous waters of Carniola.\r\n\r\nThe influence of food on the changes of animals is further shown in the\r\naphidivorous flies, that are larvae for eight or ten days, pupae for about a\r\nfortnight, and perfect insects in about the same time, in the whole living\r\nabout six weeks; whereas a pupa deprived of food underwent no change, and\r\nlived for twelve months. Rapid development of the organism invariably\r\nbrings on premature dissolution. A case is recorded of a girl who cut four\r\nteeth at the end of the first fortnight; walked about, and had hair\r\nreaching to the middle of her back after the seventh month; exhibited\r\nsigns of puberty at the ninth month, but perished in a state of exhaustion\r\nin her twelfth year. Dr. Comarmond, of Lyons, relates the case of a female\r\ninfant, who was perfectly developed at the age of twenty-seven months,\r\nbut she sank under rachitis when she had attained her twelfth year.\r\n\r\nPrecocious mental attainments are frequently as destructive of life as a\r\nrapid growth. The wonderful Baratier, at the age of four, spoke and read\r\nLatin, French, and German; was an excellent Greek scholar at six; and when\r\nten years of age, translated the Scriptures from the Hebrew; at nineteen\r\nhe died of exhaustion. The vulgar saying, \"The child is too clever to\r\nlive,\" is founded upon observation. These early specimens of superior\r\nintellect are sometimes followed by a state of imbecility. Antiochus tells\r\nus that Hermogenes, who was a celebrated rhetorician at fourteen years,\r\nwas ignorant in the extreme at twenty-four; and of him it was said,\r\n\r\n  In pueritia senex, in senectute puer.\r\n\r\nTall men generally produce children of high stature. The celebrated\r\ngrenadier guards of Frederick William, in the words of Dr. Johnson,\r\n\"_propagated procerity_;\" and the inhabitants of Potsdam are remarkable\r\nfor their height. Haller states that his own family were distinguished by\r\ntheir tallness, without excepting one single grandchild, although they\r\nwere very numerous.\r\n\r\nIn the hereditary transmission of physical and moral qualities, many\r\ncurious observations have been made. Women of high mental attainments have\r\nbeen known to produce children of genius, more frequently than men of a\r\nsuperior intellect; although Haller relates the singular case of two noble\r\nfemales who married wealthy idiots on account of their fortunes, and from\r\nwhom this melancholy defect had extended for a century into several\r\nfamilies, so that some of all their descendants still continued idiots in\r\nthe fourth and fifth generation. Horace had observed this tendency to\r\nproduce offsprings resembling their parents,\r\n\r\n  Fortes creantur fortibus et bonis:\r\n  Est in juvencis, est in equis patrum\r\n  Virtus: nec imbellem feroces\r\n  Progenerant aquilae columbam.\r\n\r\nThis remark, however, is more applicable to physical transmissions, and\r\ncertain peculiarities characterize whole families. Pliny mentioned\r\nexamples of six-fingered families, who bore the name _Sedigita_. C.\r\nHoratius had two daughters with a similar deformity. Mr. Carlisle knew a\r\nfamily in which supernumerary toes and fingers were observed for four\r\ngenerations: they were introduced by a female who had six fingers on each\r\nhand, and as many toes on each foot. From her marriage with a man\r\nnaturally formed, were produced ten children, with a supernumerary member\r\non each limb; and an eleventh, in which the peculiarity existed in both\r\nfeet and one hand, the other hand being naturally formed. The latter\r\nmarrying a man of ordinary formation, they had four children, of which\r\nthree had one or two limbs natural, and the rest with the supernumerary\r\nparts; while the fourth had six fingers on each hand, and as many toes on\r\neach foot. The latter married a woman naturally formed, and had issue by\r\nher eight children; four with the usual structure, and the same number\r\nwith the additional fingers and toes: two of them were twins, of which one\r\nwas naturally formed, and the other six-fingered and six-toed.--The\r\nwell-known porcupine family, that were exhibited in London and elsewhere,\r\nis a remarkable example of hereditary transmission of organic\r\npeculiarities. They were all covered with dark-coloured horny\r\nexcrescences, which they shed annually in the autumn or winter. Their\r\nnames were Lambert. Two brothers, John and Richard, grandsons of the\r\noriginal porcupine men, were shown in Germany.--One of these unsightly\r\nindividuals, who was exhibited some time ago in Bond-street, stated that\r\nhe was descended from the fourth generation of a savage found in the woods\r\nof America; and he further asserted that the females of the family were\r\nexempted from this lucrative but uncomfortable peculiarity: all the males\r\nhad them, and shed them regularly until the thirty-sixth year, when these\r\nspecies of quills grew to a considerable length. We have examples of\r\nbristly hair being shed in a whole family every autumn.\r\n\r\nAmongst animals, gigantic races no longer inhabit the regions which bore\r\nthem in ancient times. An extensive whale-fishery was once carried on at\r\nBiariz, in the Gulf of Gascony; and the hippopotamus is no longer to be\r\nseen on the banks of the Nile.\r\n\r\nGigantic bones having been occasionally discovered with the remains of men\r\nand horses and fragments of armour, it has been imagined that in ancient\r\ntimes armies were attended by terrific giants; but it is more than\r\nprobable that these large fragments of departed warriors belonged to\r\ntheir war-elephants, which with their horses were not unfrequently\r\nimmolated on their master's tomb.\r\n\r\nSkeletons of giants were considered by the ancients as curious as in the\r\npresent day; and those of Secondilla and Pusio were carefully preserved in\r\nthe gardens of Sallust.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have maintained that giants had more numerous vertebrae\r\nthan ordinary men; but this has not been confirmed by observation, nor has\r\nit been found that the spinal bones of dwarfs are in smaller number.\r\n\r\nSchreber, who has collected the description of the principal modern\r\ngiants, found few above seven feet and a half; although he mentions a\r\nSwedish peasant of eight feet Swedish measure, and one of the guards of\r\nthe Duke of Brunswick eight feet six inches Dutch. Not so Hakewell, who\r\ninforms us, from the testimony of Nannez, that the Emperor of China had\r\narchers and porters fifteen feet high. Howbeit, Ol. Magnus's account\r\nsurpasses his; for he tells us of a \"_puella--in capite vulnerata, mortua\r\ninduta chlamyde purpurea, longitudinis cubitorum 50, latitudinis inter\r\nhumeros quatuor_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNLAWFUL CURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can scarcely credit that at any period there could have existed men of\r\nscience and genius who believed that there were supernatural means of\r\ncuring disease, did we not even to the present day find imbeciles who\r\nverily dread the malpractices of the devil and his vicarious agents.\r\nAncient writers divided their cures into _lawful_ and _unlawful_. The\r\nformer were obtained from divine aid; the latter from sorcerers, witches,\r\nmagicians, wizards, and cunning men, who treated all maladies by spells,\r\ncabalistic words, charms, characters, images, amulets, ligatures,\r\nphilters, incantations, &c.; by which means, according to Cardan,\r\nArtesius, Picatrix, and sundry wise men, the aforesaid sorcerers and\r\nwitches could prevent fire from burning, find out thieves and stolen\r\ngoods, show absent faces in a glass, make serpents lie still, stanch\r\nblood, _salve_ gout, biting of mad dogs, toothache, _et omnia mundi\r\nmala_. \"Many doubt,\" says Nicholas Taurellus, \"whether the devil can cure\r\nsuch diseases he hath not made, and some flatly deny it; however, common\r\nexperience confirms, to our astonishment, that magicians can work such\r\nfeats, and that the devil, without impediment, can penetrate through all\r\nthe parts of our body, and cure such maladies by means to us unknown.\"\r\nSome of these means were rather singular; for St. Austin mentions as one\r\nof these processes, \"_Agentes cum patientibus conjungunt, colligere semina\r\nrerum eaque materiae applicare_;\" and learned divines, moreover inform us,\r\nthat to resist exorcisms these witches and magicians had St. Catherine's\r\nwheel imprinted on the roof of their mouths, or on some other part.\r\nTaurellus asserts, that to doubt it is to run into a sceptical extreme of\r\nincredulity. Godelman affirms that Satan is an excellent physician;\r\nLangius maintains that Jupiter Menecrates was a magician; and Marcellus\r\nDonatus pays the same compliment to Solomon, who, he says, \"cured all the\r\ndiseases of the mind by spells, charms, and drove away devils, and that\r\nEleazar did the same before Vespasian.\" Galen, in his book \"_de\r\nMedicamentis facile purandis_,\" observes after a preparation, \"_haec enim\r\nsuffita, daemonus abigunt_.\"\r\n\r\nThis fact being clearly ascertained, the next question was whether it was\r\nlawful in a desperate case to crave the help of the evil one on the\r\nprinciple\r\n\r\n  Flectere si nequeunt Superos, Acheronta movebunt.\r\n\r\nParacelsus rather impiously argues that we might, as it matters not, he\r\nsays, \"whether it be God or the devil, angels or unclean spirits,\r\n(_immundi spiritus_,) that cure him, so that he be eased. If a man fall in\r\na ditch, what matter is it whether a friend or an enemy help him out? If I\r\nbe troubled with such a malady, what care I whether the devil himself, or\r\nany of his ministers, by God's permission, redeem me?\"--and he therefore\r\nconcludes, that diseases brought on by _malefices_ can only be cured by\r\n_incantations_. However, this doctrine was denounced as abominable by\r\nRemigius, Bodinus, Godelmannus, Erastus, and various divines and\r\nschoolmen; and Delrio plainly declares, \"_mori praestat quam superstitiose\r\ncanari_.\" Therefore pontificial writers and sages recommend adjuration and\r\nexorcism by \"fire, suffumigations, lights, cutting the air with swords\r\n(_gladiorum ictus_), sacred herbs, odours,\" &c., though some hungry devils\r\ncan only be cast out by fasting.\r\n\r\nWitches and impostors, says Lord Bacon, have always held a competition\r\nwith physicians. Galen complains of this superstition, and observes that\r\npatients placed more confidence in the oracles of Esculapius and their own\r\nidle dreams than in the prescriptions of doctors. The introduction of\r\nprecious stones into medical practice owed its origin to a superstitious\r\nbelief that, from their beauty, splendour, and high value, they were the\r\nnatural receptacles for _good_ spirits. Mystery, in the dark ages, and,\r\nalas! even now, increases the confidence in remedial means; reveal their\r\ntrue nature, the charm is dissolved: \"_Minus credunt quae ad suam salutem\r\npertinent si intelligunt_,\" said Pliny. One cannot but wonder when we\r\nbehold men pre-eminent in deep learning and acute observation becoming\r\nconverts to such superstitious practices. Lord Bacon believed in spells\r\nand amulets; and Sir Theodore Mayence, who was physician to three English\r\nsovereigns, and supposed to have been Shakspeare's Dr. Caius, believed in\r\nsupernatural agency, and frequently prescribed the most disgusting and\r\nabsurd medicines, such as the heart of a mule ripped up alive, a portion\r\nof the lungs of a man who had died a violent death, or the hand of a thief\r\nwho had been gibbeted on some particular day. Nauseous medicines have ever\r\nbeen deemed the most efficacious, on the reasoning that as every thing\r\nmedicinal is nauseous, every thing that is nauseous must be medicinal. The\r\nancients firmly believed that blood can be stanched by charms; the\r\nbleeding of Ulysses was stopped by this means; and Cato the Censor has\r\ngiven us an incantation for setting dislocated bones. To this day charms\r\nare supposed to arrest the flow of blood:\r\n\r\n  Tom Pots was but a serving-man,\r\n    But yet he was a doctor good,\r\n  He bound his kerchief on the wound,\r\n    And with some kind words he stanch'd the blood.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott says, in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel,\"--\r\n\r\n  She drew the splinter from the wound,\r\n  And with a charm she stanch'd the blood.\r\n\r\nThe strength of imagination in effecting wonderful cures has been observed\r\nin all ages; and Avicenna declares, \"that he prefers confidence before\r\nart, precepts, and all remedies whatsoever.\" Our learned Burton says,\r\n\"that this strong imagination or conceit is _Astrum Hominis_, and the\r\nrudder of this our ship, which reason should steer, but overborne by\r\nphantasie, cannot manage, and so suffers itself and the whole vessel of\r\nours to be overruled and often overturned.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more absurd than the notions regarding some of these\r\nsupposed cures: a ring made of the hinge of a coffin had the power of\r\nrelieving cramps; which were also mitigated by having a rusty old sword\r\nhung up by the bedside. Nails driven in an oak-tree prevented the\r\ntoothache. A halter that had served in hanging a criminal was an\r\ninfallible remedy for a headache, when tied round the head; this affection\r\nwas equally cured by the moss growing on a human skull, dried and\r\npulverized, and taken as a cephalic snuff. A dead man's hand could dispel\r\ntumours of the glands by stroking the parts nine times, but the hand of a\r\nman who had been cut down from the gallows was the most efficacious. To\r\ncure warts, one had nothing to do but to steal a piece of beef from the\r\nbutcher, with which the warts were to be rubbed; then inter it in any\r\nfilth, and as it rotted, the warts would wither and fall.\r\n\r\nThe chips of a gallows on which several persons had been hanged, when worn\r\nin a bag round the neck, would cure the ague. A stone with a hole in it,\r\nsuspended at the head of the bed, would effectually stop the nightmare;\r\nhence it was called a _hag-stone_, as it prevents the troublesome witches\r\nfrom sitting upon the sleeper's stomach. The same amulet tied to the key\r\nof a stable-door, deterred witches from riding horses over the country.\r\n\r\nRickety children were cured by being drawn through a cleft tree, which was\r\nafterwards bound up, and as the split wood united, the child acquired\r\nstrength. Creeping through a perforated stone to cure various disorders\r\nwas a Druidical rite, still practised in the East. In the parish of Marden\r\nthere is a stone with a hole in it, fourteen inches in diameter, through\r\nwhich children are drawn for the rickets; and, in the North, infants are\r\nmade to pass through a hole cut in a _groaning_ cheese the day of their\r\nchristening.\r\n\r\nSecond sight, which, as an hereditary faculty, was deemed a malady, was\r\ncured in the Isle of Man, according to Mr. Aubrey's account, by baptizing\r\na child upon the first sight of its head. This ceremony exempts the\r\nsucceeding generation from the troublesome gift.\r\n\r\nIt is a melancholy reflection that, at various periods, impostors have\r\nimpiously called in Scriptural aid to promote their sordid or ambitious\r\nviews. Chiromancers have quoted the Bible in support of their doctrines\r\nand adduced the following lines of Job,--\"He sealeth up the hand of every\r\nman, that all men may know his works:\" while, in the like manner, the Holy\r\nInquisition of Spain and Portugal justified their atrocities on the score\r\nof the parable of the marriage of the king's son, in the 22nd of St.\r\nMatthew.\r\n\r\nUnlawful cures, as they were called, being thus anathematized, lawful\r\nremedies were resorted to, and the patient was first ordered to pray with\r\ndue devotion before he took his physic; or, as Burton observes, not one\r\nwithout the other, but both together; for, as he adds, to pray alone, and\r\nreject ordinary means, is to do like him in Aesop, that, when his cart was\r\nstalled, lay flat on his back, and cried out \"Help, Hercules!\" However,\r\nHyperius maintains that no physicians can hope for success unless \"with a\r\ntrue faith they call upon God and teach their patients to do the like.\"\r\nComineus, when he addressed the Christian princes after the overthrow of\r\nCharles of Burgundy, bade them \"first pray with all submission and\r\npenitency, confess their sins, and then take physic.\"\r\n\r\nAnother question of importance that led to much controversy was, whether\r\nit were lawful to seek the aid of the saints; the learned Burton's remarks\r\non this controverted point are so curious that they are worth relating.\r\n\"They (the papists) have a proper saint for almost every peculiar\r\ninfirmity: for poisons, gout, agues, Petronella; St. Romanus, for such as\r\nare possessed; St. Vitus for madmen, &c.; and as, of old, Pliny reckons up\r\ngods for all diseases. All affections of the mind were heretofore\r\naccounted gods: Love and Sorrow, Virtue, Honour, Liberty, Contumely,\r\nImpudency, had their temples; Tempests, Seasons, _Crepitus Ventris_, _Dea\r\nVacuna_, _Dea Cloacina_. Varro reckons up thirty thousand gods; Lucian\r\nmakes Podagra, the gout, a goddess, and assigns her priests and ministers.\r\n'Tis the same devil still, called heretofore, Apollo, Mars, Venus, &c.;\r\nthe same Jupiter, and those bad angels, are now worshipped and adored by\r\nthe name of St. Sebastian, St. Barbara, &c.; and our Lady succeeds Venus\r\nin many offices; and God often winks at these impostures, because they\r\nforsake his word, and betake themselves to the devil, as they do, that\r\nseek after holy water, crosses,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAmidst this violent denunciation against popery and devilment, evil\r\nspirits and saints, it is somewhat singular to find a spirit of anomalous\r\nperversity which justifies suicide to rid ourselves of disease and\r\nsuffering; and these very sanctimonious censors quote ancient and modern\r\nauthorities to sanction a practice which every Christian must condemn. Let\r\nus pursue the disquisition of our learned bookworm Burton:--\"Another doubt\r\nis made by philosophers, whether it be lawful for a man in such extremity\r\nof pain and grief to make away himself, and how those men that do so are\r\nto be censured. The Platonists approve of it, that it is lawful in such\r\ncases upon a necessity. Plotinus (_L. de Beatitud._) and Socrates himself\r\ndefend it (_in Plato's Phaedon_): _If any man labour of an incurable\r\ndisease, he may despatch himself, if it be to his good_. Epictetus and\r\nSeneca say, _Quamcunque veram esse viam ad libertatem_;--any way is\r\nallowable that leads to liberty. _Let us give God thanks no man is\r\ncompelled to live against his will. Quid ad hominem claustra, carcer,\r\ncustodia? liberum ostium habet._ Death is always ready at hand: _Vides\r\nillum precipitem locum, illud flumen?_ There is liberty at hand. _Effugia\r\ncervitutis et doloris sunt_, as that Laconian lad cast himself headlong,\r\n_Non serviam, aiebat puer_; to be freed of misery. Wherefore hath our\r\nmother earth brought out poisons (saith Pliny) in so great a quantity, but\r\nthat men in distress might make away themselves? which kings of old had\r\never in readiness, _ad incerta fortunae venenum sub custode promptum_. Many\r\nworthy men and women, _quorum memoria celebratur in ecclesia_, sayeth\r\nLeminctius, killed themselves to save their chastity and honour, when Rome\r\nwas taken. Jerome vindicates the same, and Ambrose commendeth Pelagia for\r\nso doing. Eusebius admired a Roman matron for the same fact, to save\r\nherself from the lust of Maxentius the tyrant. Adelhelmus, the Abbot of\r\nMalmesbury, calls them, _beatas virgines quae sic, &c._ Sir Thomas More, in\r\nhis Utopia, commends voluntary death if one be _sibi aut aliis molestus;\r\nespecially if to live be a torment to him_, let him free himself with his\r\nown hand from this tedious life, or from a prison, or suffer himself to be\r\nfreed by others.\" However, be it said in justice to our worthy Burton, he\r\ncondemns this practice as \"a false and pagan position, founded in prophane\r\nstoical paradoxes and wicked examples;\" and although he denounces most\r\nfulminating anathemas on papists, he concludes by saying, \"we ought not to\r\nbe rash and rigorous in our censures, as some are; Charity will judge and\r\nhope best; God be merciful unto us all!\"\r\n\r\nBut why should we marvel at the credulity and superstition of our\r\nforefathers, when we daily observe equal absurdities? Fanaticism and\r\nbigotry will ever strive to speculate on human weakness, and endeavour to\r\nsurround with impenetrable mists every rebel to their power who gropes for\r\nthe shrine of reason and of truth. Johanna Southcote had her votaries, and\r\nPrince Hohenlohe is still considered by many a pious person, as a\r\nvicarious instrument of divine mercy. No miraculous recovery recorded in\r\nthe dark ages can surpass the tenebral absurdity of the following relation\r\nof one of his cures:\r\n\r\nMiss O'Connor was a nun in a convent near Chelmsford, and in December\r\n1820, being about thirty years old, was suddenly attacked by a violent\r\npain in the right hand, which extended with much swelling and inflammation\r\nup the arm. The whole limb became red, swollen, extremely painful, and\r\nentirely useless. Every remedy, both topical and directed to the system,\r\nwas tried in vain for a year and a half. There was no suppuration, nor any\r\nformation of pus; but the malady continued obdurate, and yielded to no\r\napplication. The resources of the flesh having manifestly failed, Mrs.\r\nGerard, the worthy superior, very properly betook herself to those of the\r\nspirit. She made a request through a friend to Prince Hohenlohe to assist\r\nthe patient in this her extreme case; when the following precious\r\ndocument, which it would be impious to translate into heretical English,\r\nwas received:\r\n\r\n    \"_Pour la Religeuse Novice d'Angleterre._\r\n\r\n    \"Le trois du mois de Mai, a huit heures, je dirai, conformement a\r\n    votre demande, pour votre guerison, mes prieres. Joignez-y a la meme\r\n    heure, apres avoir confesse et communie, les votres, avec cette\r\n    ferveur angelique et cette confiance pleniere que nous devons a notre\r\n    Redempteur J. C.: excitez au fond de votre coeur les vertus divines\r\n    d'un vrai repentir, d'un amour Chretien, d'une croyance sans bornes\r\n    d'etre exauce, et d'une resolution inebranlable de mener une vie\r\n    exemplaire, afin de vous maintenir en etat de grace. Agreez\r\n    l'assurance de ma consideration.\r\n\r\n        \"PRINCE ALEXANDRE HOHENLOHE.\r\n\r\n    \"Bamberg, Mars 16, 1822.\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that this letter, which was no doubt a circular to\r\nhis proselytes, with necessary blanks to be filled up _pro re nata_, as\r\nthe doctors have it, was not drawn out in better French. Howbeit, on the\r\nappointed day, asserts Dr. Baddely (the lady's unsuccessful medical\r\nattendant), Miss O'Connor went through the religious process prescribed by\r\nher princely physician. Mass being said, Miss O. not finding the immediate\r\nrelief she expected from her faith, or faithfully expected, exclaimed\r\nsomewhat impatiently, not having the fear of Job before her eyes, \"Thy\r\nwill be done, O Lord, since thou hast not thought me worthy of this cure;\"\r\nwhen behold! _immediately_ after she felt an extraordinary sensation\r\nthroughout the whole arm to the end of the fingers. The pain _instantly_\r\nleft her, the swelling gradually subsided, and Dr. B., who no doubt was\r\nthe pet physician of the nuns, declares that the hand shortly resumed its\r\nnatural size and shape.\r\n\r\nNow, Miss O'Connor was most likely a young lady from Ireland, where this\r\nmiraculous cure was re-echoed in every chapel. The protestants were\r\nnaturally offended by a report which seemed to impugn the sanctity of the\r\nreformed religion, and they thought it incumbent on them, for the welfare\r\nof church and state, to get up a miracle of their own which would cast\r\nPrince H., Nun O., and Dr. B. in the shade. The following statement was\r\ntherefore published and certified upon oath by sundry most respectable and\r\nmost worthy Orangemen:\r\n\r\n\"I pledge you the word and honour of an Orangeman that the following\r\nfacts, sworn to by all present, occurred yesterday evening. A party of\r\ngentlemen dined with me, and after dinner a vase, containing some orange\r\nlilies, was placed upon the table by my directions. We drank several\r\ntoasts; but on the glorious and immortal memory being given, an _unblown\r\nlily_, which the party had remarked, _expanded its leaves and bloomed\r\nbefore us_ in all its splendour!\" How appropriate are the lines of Otway\r\nwhen applied to the propagators of such absurdities, who dare to call upon\r\nour faith to give credence to their impostures.\r\n\r\n                  You want to lead\r\n  My reason blindfold like a hamper'd lion\r\n  Check'd of its noble vigour; then, when baited\r\n  Down to obedient tameness, make it crouch\r\n  And show strange tricks, which you call signs of faith:\r\n  So silly souls are gull'd, and you get money.\r\n\r\nA curious anecdote is related of Lord Chief Justice Holt. When a young\r\nman, he happened, with some of his merry companions, to run up a score at\r\na country inn, which they were not able to pay. In this dilemma they\r\nappealed to Holt, to get them out of the scrape. Our young lawyer had\r\nobserved that the inn-keeper's daughter looked very ill, and, passing\r\nhimself for a medical student, asked her father what ailed her, when he\r\nwas informed that she suffered from an ague. Holt immediately gathered\r\nvarious plants, mixed them up with great ceremony, and after rolling them\r\nup in parchment, scrawled upon the ball some cabalistic characters. The\r\namulet, thus prepared, he suspended round the neck of the young woman,\r\nand, strange to say, the ague did not return. After this cure the doctor\r\noffered to pay the bill, to which the grateful landlord would not consent,\r\nallowing Holt and his party to leave the house.\r\n\r\nMany years after, when on the bench, a woman was brought before him,\r\naccused of witchcraft--the very last person tried upon such a charge. Her\r\nonly defence was, that she possessed a ball invariably efficacious in the\r\ncure of agues. The charm was produced, handed to the judge, who recognised\r\nthe identical ball which he had prepared in his youthful frolics.\r\n\r\nNot only did these victims of superstition firmly believe that evil\r\nspirits had the power of inflicting disease, and afterwards salve the\r\nmischief, but they were also invested with the privilege of killing and\r\nsubsequently restoring to life. The story related of the truly learned\r\nAgrippa, who was falsely represented as a necromancer, is curious.\r\n\r\nAgrippa had occasion one time to be absent for a few days from his\r\nresidence in Louvain. During his absence he intrusted his wife with the\r\nkey of his museum, but with an earnest injunction that no one on any\r\naccount should be allowed to enter it; Agrippa happened at that time to\r\nhave a boarder in his house, a young fellow of insatiable curiosity, who\r\nconstantly importuned his hostess, till at length he obtained from her the\r\nforbidden key. The first thing that attracted his attention was a book of\r\nspells and incantations. He spread the volume before him, and, thinking no\r\nharm, began to read aloud. He had not long continued this occupation, when\r\na knock was heard at the door of the chamber. The youth took no notice,\r\nbut continued reading. Presently there followed a second and a louder\r\nknock, which somewhat alarmed the reader. The space of a minute having\r\nelapsed, and no answer been made, the door opened and a demon entered.\r\n\"For what purpose am I called?\" said the unwelcome visitor in a stern\r\nvoice: \"What is it you demand to have done?\" The youth was seized with the\r\ngreatest alarm and struck speechless. The demon then rushed upon him,\r\nseized him by the throat, and strangled him, indignant no doubt in having\r\nbeen interrupted in some more interesting pursuit to no purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the expected time Agrippa came home, and to his great surprise found a\r\nnumber of devils capering about, and playing strange antics on the roof of\r\nhis house. By his art he caused them to desist from their gambols, of\r\nwhich he demanded the cause. The chief of them then related to him what he\r\nhad done, how he had been disturbed and insulted, and how he had thought\r\nproper to revenge himself. Agrippa became much alarmed at the probable\r\nconsequences of this unfortunate adventure, and he ordered the demon,\r\nwithout loss of time, to reanimate his victim, and walk about the streets\r\nwith him, that the public might behold him alive. The infernal spirit\r\nreluctantly obeyed, and went forth with the student in the marketplace and\r\npromenades. This excursion over, however, he maliciously allowed his\r\ncompanion to fall down, when life once more flitted from his body. For a\r\ntime it was thought that the student had been killed by a sudden attack of\r\nillness; but, presently, the marks of strangulation became evident, and\r\nthe truth came out. Agrippa was thus suddenly obliged to quit the town,\r\nand seek refuge in a distant state.\r\n\r\nIt was further related of this supposed wizard, that he was always\r\naccompanied by a familiar spirit in the shape of a black dog; and that\r\nwhen he lay on his deathbed he was earnestly exhorted to repent of his\r\nsins. Struck with remorse, he took hold of the dog, and removed from his\r\nneck a collar studded with cabalistic nails, exclaiming, \"Begone, wretched\r\nanimal, that has been the cause of my perdition!\" and lo! the dog\r\nimmediately ran away, and, plunging into the river Soane, disappeared. It\r\nis to be regretted that historians do not relate whether the water hissed\r\nor not when the canine devil took his last leap.\r\n\r\nIt merits notice, that the mystic and medicinal celebrity of various\r\nsubstances have to this hour survived the traditions of their\r\nsuperstitious origin; coral, for instance, which was considered as\r\npossessed of the power of keeping off evil spirits, and rendering effete\r\nthe malefices of the evil eye, was constantly worn as an amulet; and\r\nParacelsus informs us that it should be worn round the necks of infants,\r\nas an admirable preservative against fits, sorcery, charms, and poisons.\r\nWe still find necklaces of this substance suspended by fond mothers and\r\nnurses round the necks of infants. In the West Indies these chaplets are\r\nworn by the negroes as a magic protection against Obiism, and they even\r\naffirm that the colour of the coral is affected by the state of health of\r\nthe wearer, and becomes paler when he is ill.\r\n\r\nThe irrational belief in the mysterious powers of certain remedies went so\r\nfar in former days, that when they were applied to the weapon that had\r\ninflicted an injury, their indirect sympathetic action was considered as\r\neffectual as if they had been used to heal the wound. The sympathetic\r\npowder of Sir Kenelm Digby, which was nothing else but pulverized green\r\nvitriol, was eulogized in a discourse pronounced by its inventor, at\r\nMontpellier, in 1658. Our James I. purchased this wonderful discovery from\r\nSir Kenelm, who pretended that he had obtained it from a Carmelite friar,\r\nwho had learned it in America and Persia. This superstitious practice is\r\nalluded to by Walter Scott, in the \"Lay of the Last Minstrel:\"\r\n\r\n  But she has ta'en the broken lance,\r\n  And wash'd it from the clotted gore,\r\n  And salved the splinter o'er and o'er.\r\n\r\nDryden has also illustrated this absurdity in his \"Enchanted Island,\"\r\nwhere Ariel says,\r\n\r\n  Anoint the sword which pierced him, with this\r\n  Weapon-salve, and wrap it close from air\r\n  Till I have time to visit it again.\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm's sympathetic powder was applied in the same manner; the weapon\r\nbeing covered with ointment and dressed three times a day. But it was not\r\nmentioned that at the same time the wound was to be brought together, and\r\nbound up with clean linen bandages for seven days. This wonderful cure was\r\nthen simply the process of what surgeons call healing by first intention,\r\nwhich means uniting the lips of the wound without suppuration. Dr. Paris\r\napprehends that this secret was suggested to the worthy knight by the\r\ncures operated by the rust of the spear of Telephus, which, according to\r\nHomer, healed the injuries it had occasioned; and this rust was most\r\nprobably verdigris.\r\n\r\nTo this day the Irish peasantry, and even many of the superior classes,\r\nfirmly believe in the malevolent and destructive effect of the evil eye,\r\nwhen cast upon man or beast. Hence the absurd custom that prevails,\r\nespecially in the western provinces, of adding \"God bless it,\" to any\r\nexpression of admiration; and if perchance a Sassenagh traveller exclaimed\r\n\"What a sweet child!\" or, \"What a fine cow!\" without the adjunctive\r\nbenediction, he would be suspected of malefice, and the priest forthwith\r\nsummoned to save the devoted victim of sorcery. In Scotland dairy-maids\r\ndrive cattle with a switch of the mountain ash, or roan-tree, considered\r\nas held sacred since the days of Druidism; and in some districts the sheep\r\nand lambs are made to pass through a hoop of its wood on the first day of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nThe toad was also considered to be possessed of marvellous qualities for\r\nthe cure of various maladies, more especially the stone that was supposed\r\nto be occasionally found in the reptile's head, and which was called\r\n_Crapaudina_. Lupton, in his seventh book of \"Notable Things,\" thus\r\ninstructs us how to obtain it. \"You shall knowe whether the tode stone be\r\nthe ryght and perfect stone or not. Holde the stone before a tode, so that\r\nhe may see it; and if it be a ryght and true stone, the tode will leape\r\ntowarde it and make as though he would snatch it, he envies so much that\r\nman should have this stone.\" This famous toadstone is simply one of the\r\nfossil teeth of various fishes, and is chiefly formed of phosphate of\r\nlime. Its high polish and convexity has often induced lapidaries to have\r\nit set in rings and other jewels, to which marvellous powers were\r\nattached.\r\n\r\nPulverized toads were not only employed in medicine with supposed\r\nadvantage, but were also considered a slow but certain poison. Solander\r\nrelates, that a Roman woman, desirous of poisoning her husband gave him\r\nthis substance; but instead of attaining her criminal desire, it cured him\r\nof a dropsy that had long perplexed him. Boccaccio relates the story of\r\nPasquino and Simona, two young lovers, who, wandering in a garden,\r\nplucked some sage-leaves, with which Pasquino rubbed his teeth and gums.\r\nIn a few minutes he fell ill and expired. Simona accused of being his\r\nassassin, was brought before a magistrate, who ordered an immediate\r\ninvestigation of the matter, when, on proceeding to the garden, Simona,\r\nafter relating the particulars of the case, took some leaves from the same\r\nplant and used them in a similar manner. In a few minutes the lovers were\r\nreunited in death; when it was discovered that a large toad was under the\r\nroot of the plant to which it had communicated its deadly venom.\r\n\r\nRegarding unlawful cures, have we not seen vaccination, when first\r\nintroduced, condemned from the very pulpit as an impious interference in a\r\ndisease which seemed to have been assigned to mankind by the Creator as an\r\ninevitable doom? Did not these desperate bigots even pronounce that we\r\nwere not warranted to seek in the brute creation a human remedy or\r\npreservative? What is still more worthy of remark, is the coincidence of a\r\nsimilar idea in India, where the greatest obstacle vaccination encountered\r\narose from a belief that the natural smallpox was a dispensation of a\r\nmalicious deity, called _Mah-ry-Umma_, or rather that the disease was an\r\nincarnation of the goddess herself into the person who was affected by it:\r\nthe fear of irritating her, and of exposing themselves to her resentment,\r\nnecessarily rendered the natives averse to vaccination, until it was\r\nimpressed upon their easy belief, that _Mah-ry-Umma_ had altered her mind,\r\nand chosen this new and milder mode of manifesting her visits to her\r\nvotaries.\r\n\r\nCould there ever have existed a more superstitious belief than that which\r\nvested in the regal touch a healing power? Yet from Edward the Confessor\r\nto the accession of the House of Hanover, it was generally thought in\r\nthese realms that our kings could cure scrofula with their anointed\r\nfingers!\r\n\r\nDr. Paris's truly philosophic remarks on this subject, in his valuable\r\nwork, entitled Pharmacologia, are worthy of quotation:--\"Credulity,\r\nalthough it is nearly allied to superstition, yet differs from it widely.\r\nCredulity is an unbounded belief in what is possible, although destitute\r\nof proof, and perhaps of probability; but superstition is a belief in what\r\nis wholly repugnant to the laws of the physical and moral world. Credulity\r\nis a far greater source of error than superstition; for the latter must be\r\nalways more limited in its influence, and can exist only, to any\r\nconsiderable extent, in the most ignorant portions of society; whereas\r\nthe former diffuses itself through the minds of all classes, by which the\r\nrank and dignity of science are degraded, its valuable labours confounded\r\nwith the vain pretensions of empiricism, and ignorance is enabled to claim\r\nfor itself the prescriptive right of delivering oracles, amidst all the\r\ntriumph of truth and the progress of philosophy. Credulity has been justly\r\ndefined _belief without reason_, while scepticism, its opposite, is\r\n_reason without belief_, and the natural and invariable consequence of\r\ncredulity; for it may be observed that men who believe without reason are\r\nsucceeded by others whom no reasoning can convince.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOICE AND SPEECH.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlumenbach has given us a most ingenious definition of this wonderful\r\nfunction. The voice, properly speaking, is a sound formed by means of\r\nexpiration in the _larynx_, which is a most beautifully constructed organ,\r\nfixed upon the top of the windpipe, like a capital upon a column. It is\r\ncomposed of various cartilages, united in the form of a little box, and\r\nsupplied with numerous muscles, that, moving altogether or separately,\r\nproduce the variations of sound.\r\n\r\nThe part of the _larynx_ most concerned in producing the voice is the\r\n_glottis_, or narrow opening of the windpipe, having the _epiglottis_\r\nsuspended over it like a valve. The air expired from the lungs strikes\r\nupon the glottis, and thus becomes sonorous. The change that the glottis\r\nundergoes in the modulation of the voice has been matter of much\r\ncontroversy. Aristotle and Galen compared the glottis to a wind\r\ninstrument; Ferrein assimilated it to a chorded one. This latter\r\nhypothesis was objected to, on the principle that a chord, to vibrate,\r\nshould not only be in a state of tension, but dryness; characters which\r\nthis organ does not possess, being constantly lubrified with mucus, and in\r\na state of greater or lesser relaxation. Fulgentius considers the human\r\nvoice to be composed of ten parts: the four first are the front teeth, so\r\nuseful for the appulse of the tongue in forming sounds, without which a\r\nwhistle would be produced instead of a voice; the fifth and sixth are the\r\nlips, which he compares to cymbals striking against each other; the\r\nseventh the tongue, which serves as a plectrum to articulate sounds; the\r\neighth is the palate, the concavity of which forms the belly of the\r\ninstrument; the ninth the throat, which performs the part of a flute; and\r\nthe tenth the lungs, which supply the place of bellows.\r\n\r\nThat every degree of action in the _glottis_ is due to the muscles of the\r\n_larynx_ is proved by the experiment of tying or dividing the recurrent\r\nnerves, when the voice is destroyed or weakened.\r\n\r\nSpeech is a peculiar modification of the voice adjusted to the formation\r\nof the sounds of letters, by the expiration of the air through the\r\nnostrils and mouth, and in a great measure by the assistance of the tongue\r\napplied and struck against the neighbouring parts, the palate and front\r\nteeth in particular, and by the diversified action of the lips. This is\r\nPayne Knight's doctrine, in his analytical essay on the Greek alphabet,\r\nand an illustration of the notions of Fulgentius.\r\n\r\nSinging is compounded of speech and a musical modulation of the voice, a\r\nprerogative peculiar to man even in his most savage state; for, despite\r\nthe assertions of the visionary Rousseau, who maintained that it is not\r\nnatural to our species, we find that even in the uncivilized regions of\r\nEthiopia, Greenland, and Kamtschatka, singing is a solace and a comfort.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of speech and articulation is so intricate, that even the\r\ndivision of letters and their distribution are attended with difficulties.\r\nThe following is the division of Amman in his work _Surdus Loquens_,\r\npublished at Amsterdam in 1629, and enlarged under the title of _Dissert.\r\nde Loquela_, 1700, and is, perhaps, the most natural and intelligible.\r\n\r\nHe divides into, I. Vowels; II. Semi-vowels; III. Consonants.\r\n\r\nI. The vowels are _simple_, _a_, _e_, _i_, _o_, _u_; and _mixed_ _ae_, _oe_,\r\n_ue_: these are formed by the _voice_ only. The semi-vowels and consonants\r\nare articulated by the mechanism of _speech_.\r\n\r\nII. The semi-vowels are _nasal_, _m_, _n_, _ng_ (_n_ before _g_, which is\r\nnearly related to it), that is, the labio-nasal _m_, the dente-nasal _n_,\r\nand the gutture-nasal _ng_; or _oral_ (lingual), _r_, _l_, that is, _r_\r\nwith a vibration of the tongue, or _l_ with the tongue less moved.\r\n\r\nIII. The consonants he distinguishes into _sibilant_ (pronounced in\r\nsuccession), _h_, _g_, _ch_, _s_, _sh_, _f_, _v_, _ph_, that is _h_,\r\nformed in the throat, as it were a mere aspiration; _g_ and _ch_, true\r\nconsonants; _s_, _sh_, produced between the teeth; and _f_, _v_,\r\n_ph_--formed by the application of the lower lip to the upper front\r\nteeth--and _explosive_ (which are as it were suddenly exploded by an\r\nexpiration for a time suppressed, or interrupted), namely _k_, _q_, formed\r\nin the throat; _d_, _t_, about the teeth; _p_, _b_, near the lips; and\r\n_double_ (compound), _x_, _z_.[3]\r\n\r\nIt has been thought that the tongue was indispensable for the purposes of\r\nspeech, yet there are instances on record in which this has not been found\r\nan invariable rule. Dr. Conyers Middleton mentions two cases of distinct\r\narticulation with at least little or no tongue. In his exposure of the\r\n_pious_ deceptions of weak and wicked Christians during the first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era, he notices a pretty tale of an Arian\r\nprince cutting out the tongues of some of the orthodox party, and these\r\nbeing as able to talk as before; nay, one of them, who had been dumb from\r\nhis birth, gained the faculty of speech by losing his tongue! We find\r\nvarious accounts of persons who spoke more or less fluently without this\r\norgan. Jussieu has inserted in the _Memoires de l'Academie des Sciences_,\r\n1718, the case of a Portuguese girl, who instead of a tongue had merely a\r\nlittle protuberance of about four lines in diameter in the middle of her\r\nmouth, and endowed with the power of contraction and dilatation; she spoke\r\ndistinctly, but experienced difficulty in pronouncing _c_, _f_, _g_, _l_,\r\n_n_, _r_, _s_, _t_, _x_, and _z_, when she was obliged to bend her neck\r\nforward to upraise as it were the larynx. In this case, deglutition could\r\nnot be well performed, and she was obliged to use her finger to propel the\r\nmasticated food downwards.\r\n\r\nDr. Eliotson observes, that it is by no means improbable that the progress\r\nof modern art may present us at some future period with mechanical\r\nsubstitutes for orators and preachers; for, putting aside the magic heads\r\nof Albertus Magnus and Roger Bacon, Kratzenstein actually constructed an\r\ninstrument to produce the vowels. De Kempelin has published a full account\r\nof his celebrated speaking machine, which perfectly imitated the human\r\nvoice. The French celebrated mechanician, the Abbe Mical, also made two\r\nheads of brass, which pronounced very distinctly entire phrases; these\r\nheads were colossal, and their voices powerful and sonorous. The French\r\ngovernment refusing, it is said, in 1782, to purchase these automata, the\r\nunfortunate and too sensitive inventor, in a paroxysm of despair,\r\ndestroyed these masterpieces of scientific ingenuity.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that in various races the pronunciation seemed to\r\ndepend upon some peculiar and characteristic conformation; and Adelung\r\ninforms us that in the Hottentots, the bony palate is smaller, shorter,\r\nand less arched than in the other races, and that the tongue, especially\r\nin the Bosjesman tribe, is rounder, thicker, and shorter. Hence their\r\npronunciation is singular, and has been compared to the clucking of the\r\nTurkey, or the harsh and broken noises produced by some other birds. They\r\ncombine their aspirated gutturals with hard consonants, without any\r\nintervening vowels, in a manner that Europeans cannot imitate.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the differences of language are as numerous as the other\r\ndistinctions which characterize the several races of men. The various\r\ndegrees of natural capacity and of intellectual progress; the prevalence\r\nof particular faculties; the nature of surrounding circumstances; the ease\r\nor difficulty with which our different wants and desires are gratified,\r\nwill produce not only peculiar characters in the nature and construction\r\nof language, but in its copiousness and development.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious points in the subject of language, is the\r\ncontinued existence in a large portion of Asia, very anciently civilized,\r\nand considerably advanced, at least in the useful arts, of simple\r\nmonosyllabic languages, which are not in the slightest degree connected\r\nwith the peculiar organization of the Mongolian variety, to which these\r\npeople belong, and whose language is distinctly polysyllabic.\r\n\r\nThe attempts that have been made to trace the origin of languages to the\r\nvarieties of our species, or to the influence of climate, have hitherto\r\nbeen fruitless, and the doctrines broached on the obscure subject refuted\r\nby observation. Mr. Jefferson states that there are twenty radical\r\nlanguages in America for one in Asia; more than twenty languages, he adds,\r\nare still spoken in the kingdom of Mexico, most of which are at least as\r\ndifferent from one another as the Greek and the German, the French and the\r\nPolish. The variety of idioms spoken by the people of the new continent,\r\nand which without the least exaggeration may be stated at some hundreds,\r\noffers a very striking phenomenon, particularly when we compare it to the\r\nfew languages spoken in Asia and in Europe. Vater also informs us, that in\r\nMexico, where the causes producing insulation of the several tribes\r\nhave been for a long time in a course of diminution, Clavigero\r\nrecognised thirty-five different languages. Some of these words are\r\nrather of difficult pronunciation, and Humboldt tells us that\r\n_Notlazomahuiztespixcatatzin_ is the term of respect with which they\r\naddressed their priests. During the French revolution, a learned Jacobin\r\ndiscovered that the early Peruvians adored a divinity who patronized the\r\n_Sans-culottes_, of their day, and who was named _Cawaltze-quos_, i. e.\r\nwithout breeches. Such barbarous words do not constitute that engaging\r\ntongue that Shakspeare calls \"_speaking holiday_,\" but rather confirms\r\nByron's ideas of the Russians' difficult expressions, which no man has\r\nleisure to pronounce except on high-days and holidays.\r\n\r\nAlthough brutes pronounce no articulate sounds, there is, no doubt but\r\nthey have a language perfectly intelligible to one another. Their manner\r\nof expressing their different emotions is in some instances perfectly\r\ndistinct; and birds have most decidedly a peculiar language. The following\r\nmay be said to be the words of a nightingale's strain observed by\r\nBechstein, an ingenious ornithologist, and committed to paper several\r\ntimes while he listened with deep attention to that sweet bird's\r\n\"complaining notes,\" that \"tune our distresses and record our woes.\"\r\n\r\n                Tiouou, tiouou, tiouou tiouou\r\n                Shpe, tiou, tokoua\r\n                Tio, tio, tio, tio.\r\n                Kououtio, kououtio kououtio,\r\n                Tskouo, tskouo, tskouo,\r\n            Tsii, tsii, tsii, tsii, tsii, tsii, tsii, tsii tsii tsii,\r\n                Kouoror tiou.

Gall and\r\nvarious observers of animals have fully ascertained that the attention of\r\ndogs is awakened by our conversation. He brought one of these intelligent\r\ncreatures with him from Vienna to Paris, which perfectly understood French\r\nand German, of which he satisfied himself by repeating before it whole\r\nsentences in both languages. A recent anecdote has been related of an old\r\nship-dog, that leaped overboard and swam to the shore on hearing the\r\ncaptain exclaim, \"Poor old Neptune! I fear we shall have to drown him!\"\r\nand such was the horror which that threat inspired, that he never\r\nafterwards would approach the captain or any of the ship's company, to\r\nwhom he had previously been fondly attached. It must, however, be observed\r\nthat in the brute creation, as in ours (sometimes more brutal species),\r\npeculiar attributes, that do not belong to the race, distinguish\r\nindividuals gifted with what in man we might call a superior intellect,\r\nbut which in these animals shows a superiority of what we term instinct.\r\nSpurzheim relates an instance of a cow belonging to Mr. Dupont de Nemours,\r\nwhich, amongst the whole kindred herd, was the only one that could open\r\nthe gate leading to their pastures; and her anxious comrades, when\r\narriving at the wished-for spot, invariably lowed for their conductor. It\r\nis also related of a hound, who, unable to obtain a seat near the fire\r\nwithout the risk of quarrelling with the dozing occupants that crowded the\r\nhearth, was wont to run out into the court-yard barking an alarum that\r\nbrought away his rivals in comfort, when he quietly reentered the parlour,\r\nand selected an eligible stretching-place. This animal displayed as much\r\ningenuity as the traveller who, according to the well-known story, ordered\r\noysters for his horse for the purpose of clearing the fireside.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECSTATIC EXALTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis rapturous excitement is not unfrequently the province of the\r\nphysician. Fortunately perhaps for the patient, it is an incurable malady,\r\nillustrating the lines of Dryden,\r\n\r\n  There is a pleasure, sure, in being mad,\r\n  Which none but madmen know.\r\n\r\nIf we admit this state of ecstasy to be a mental aberration, it is surely\r\nof an enviable nature, since it elevates the soul to a beatitude which is\r\nrarely the lot of man.\r\n\r\nNo definition of this state can equal that given by St. Theresa of her own\r\nfeelings. By prayer she had attained what she calls a \"celestial\r\nquietude,--a state of union, rapture, and ecstasy.\" \"I experienced,\" she\r\ncontinues, \"a sort of sleep of all the faculties of the soul--intellect,\r\nmemory, and volition; during which, though they were but slumbering, they\r\nhad no conception of their mode of operation. It was a voluptuous\r\nsensation, such as one might experience when expiring in raptures in the\r\nbosom of our God. The soul is unconscious of its actions; she (the soul)\r\nknows not if she speaks or if she remains silent, if she laughs or if she\r\ncries. It is, in short, a blessed extravagance, a celestial madness, in\r\nwhich she attains in the knowledge of true wisdom, an inconceivable\r\nconsolation. She is on the point of merging into a state of languor;\r\nbreathless, exhausted, the slightest motion, even of the hands, is\r\nunutterably difficult. The eyes are closed by a spontaneous movement; or,\r\nif they remain open, the power of vision has fled. In vain they endeavour\r\nto read: they can distinguish letters, but are unable to class them into\r\nwords. Speak to a person in this absorbed condition, no answer will be\r\nobtained; although endeavouring to speak, utterance is impossible.\r\nDeprived of all external faculties, those of the soul are increased, to\r\nenjoy glorious raptures when conversing with the Deity and surrounding\r\nangels.\" These conversations the blessed St. Theresa relates; and she\r\nfurther states, that after having remained about an hour in this joyous\r\ntrance, she recovered her usual senses, and found her eyes streaming in\r\ntears, as though they were weeping for the loss she had experienced in\r\nbeing restored to earthly relations.\r\n\r\nNow, with all due deference to St. Theresa, this state was most probably a\r\nhysteric condition. Zimmerman relates two cases somewhat of a similar\r\nkind. Madame M. experienced effusions of divine love of a peculiar\r\nnature. She first fell into a state of ecstasy, motionless and insensible,\r\nduring which, she affirms, she felt this love penetrating her whole being,\r\nwhile a new life seemed to thrill through every fibre. Suddenly she\r\nstarted up, and seizing one of her companions, exclaimed, \"Come, haste\r\nwith me to follow and call Love, for I cannot sufficiently call upon his\r\nname!\"--A French young lady was the second instance of this affection. She\r\nalso frequently lost the power of speech and all external senses, animated\r\nwith a love divine, spending whole nights in ecstatic bliss, and\r\nrapturously embraced by her mystic lover. It is difficult, perhaps, to\r\nseparate this amorous feeling from physical temperament; and the following\r\nremarks of Virey on the subject of St. Theresa are most judicious:--\"She\r\npossessed an ardent and sensitive disposition, transported, no doubt, by\r\nterrestrial affection, which she strove to exchange for a more exalted\r\nardour for the Deity; for devotion and love are more or less of a similar\r\ncharacter. Theresa was not fired by that adoration which is exclusively\r\ndue to the infinite and invisible Intelligence which rules the universe;\r\nbut she fancied a sensible, an anthropomorphous divinity; so much so, that\r\nshe not unfrequently reproached herself with bitterness that these\r\nraptures were not sufficiently unconnected with corporeal pleasures and\r\nvoluptuous feelings.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Theresa was not the only beatified enthusiast who suspected that the\r\nevil spirit occasionally interfered in those ecstatic visions. St. Thomas\r\nAquinas divides ecstasies into three classes;--the first arising from\r\ndivine power, and enjoyed by the prophets, St. Paul, and various other\r\nsaints. The second was the work of the devil, who bound down all external\r\nsenses, suspended their action, and reduced the body to the condition of a\r\ncorpse: such were the raptures in which magicians and sorcerers were\r\nfrequently entranced, during which, according to Tertullian and other\r\nwriters, the soul quitted the body to wander about the world, inquire into\r\nall its occurrences, and then returned with the intelligence it had\r\nobtained to its former abode. The third rapturous category of St. Thomas\r\nhe simply attributes to physical causes, constituting mental alienation.\r\n\r\nMay not all these ecstatic raptures be considered as belonging to this\r\nthird class? It has been observed that women, hysteric ones in particular,\r\nwere the most subject to this supposed inspired affection; and amongst men\r\nit has also been remarked, that the enraptured individual was in general\r\nnervous, debilitated, and bald; and it is well known that the fall of the\r\nhair is frequently the result of moral and physical weakness, brought on\r\nby long studies, contemplation, grief, and illness, all of which may\r\noccasion mental aberration; for what other denomination can be given to\r\nthe ecstatic state of the Monks of Mount Athos, who pretended or fancied\r\nthat they experienced celestial joys when gazing on their umbilical\r\nregion, in converse with the Deity? Hence were they called\r\n_Omphalopsychians_, whose notions in the matter are thus described by\r\nAllatius: \"Elevate thy spirit above earthly concerns, press thy beard upon\r\nthy breast, turn thine eyes and all thy thoughts upon the middle of thine\r\nabdomen, hold thy breath, seek in thy bowels the abode of thy heart--then\r\nwilt thou find it unalloyed with dense and tenebral mists; persevere in\r\nthis contemplation for days and nights, and thou shalt know uninterrupted\r\njoys, when thy spirit shall have found out thy heart and has illumined\r\nitself.\"[4]\r\n\r\nBernier relates an act of supposed devotion amongst the Fakirs nearly as\r\nabsurd, when, to seek the blessings of a new light, they rivet their eyes\r\nin silent contemplation upon the ceiling; then gradually looking down,\r\nthey fix both eyes gazing, or rather squinting, at the tip of their nose,\r\nuntil the aforesaid light beameth on them.\r\n\r\nSt. Augustin mentions a priest who could at will fall into one of these\r\necstasies, during which his external senses were so totally suppressed\r\nthat he did not experience the pangs of the torture. Cardanus affirms that\r\nhe was possessed of the same faculty. \"_Quoties volo_,\" he says, \"_extra\r\nsensum quasi in exstasim transeo--sentio dum eam ineo, ac (ut verius\r\ndicam) facio, juxta cor quandam separationem, quasi anima abscederet,\r\ntotique corpori res haec communicatur, quasi ostiolum quoddam aperiretur.\r\nEt initium hujus est a capite, maxime cerebello, diffunditurque per totam\r\ndorsi spinam, vi magna continetur; hocque solum sentio, quad sum extra\r\nmeipsum magnaque quadam vi paululum me contineo._\"\r\n\r\nThis state of mind is usually succeeded by contemplation, which has justly\r\nbeen considered one of the attributes of Genius. This contemplation,\r\nhowever, may be applied to positive relation, or to the workings of\r\nfiction. In the latter case it becomes to a certain degree mental, and\r\nbeyond the control or the influence of our reason, although we cannot\r\nregulate the rationality of our mental pursuits by any given or\r\nacknowledged standard. The pseudo-philosopher, who searches for the\r\n_elixir vitae_ or the power of transmuting metals, and the judicial\r\nastrologer, are in the eyes of society madmen: yet, do they reason on\r\ncertain rational principles, and in many respects may be considered wise;\r\none might figuratively say, that here the mind must have taken flight\r\nbeyond its natural limits, if we can limit thought. In the wild wanderings\r\nof Theosophy man has fancied that by abstracting himself from the world,\r\nhe might place himself in relation with the Divinity, and has so forcibly\r\nindulged the flattering illusion, that he actually believes that he is in\r\nconverse with his Creator or his angels. Unquestionably this is a state of\r\nmania, yet is it founded upon a systematic train of ideas, that, strictly\r\nspeaking, does not partake of mental aberration, but rather of enthusiasm.\r\nAlthough an indulgence in this may terminate in mania, still there is\r\nsomething delightful in these fond aberrations. A new world--a new\r\ncondition is evoked--we are freed from the trammels of society and its\r\nprejudices--and perhaps encompassed by misery we burst from its shackles\r\ninto another orb of our own creation, when the eyes closed in a vision of\r\nbliss--a meridian sunbeam, through the darkness of night. If the slumber\r\nof the visionary ushered in death, his destiny might be enviable--he had\r\nalready quitted the world, seeking the presence of his God--his soul had\r\nalready soared from its earthly tenement.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that such contemplation may lead us to a better\r\nknowledge of the Supreme Being, whose image and attributes have been\r\ndistorted by ignorance and superstition. It has been truly said, that\r\nuntil the light of Christianity shone upon mankind, God was unknown. He\r\nhad been represented as wrathful and revengeful--implacable in his\r\nanger--insatiable in his thirst for blood--when he was revealed to us\r\nupon the earth, gentle, forgiving, loving, humble, and charitable. The\r\ntype of all excellence--and delivering doctrines so pure, so convincing,\r\nas to entitle him to the name of _Saviour_, even were his godhead\r\ndoubted--for who could question the salvation of those who followed his\r\nlaws. Until ambition swayed the church and polluted the altar with blood\r\nand rapine--how happy, how blessed were these followers--even in the midst\r\nof persecution and in agonies--pardoning their barbarous murderers and\r\npraying for their conversion.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately according to the temperament of individuals their ecstasy\r\nhas frequently led to an enthusiasm which knew no bounds, and induced the\r\nilluminated visionary to consider all men who did not coincide in his\r\nopinions the enemies of Divinity--hence arose fanaticism and\r\npersecution--yet did these murderous madmen conceive that they were\r\nwielding their hateful sword in the cause of an offended God; and,\r\nalthough we read of their excesses and cruelty with horror, they were not\r\nbad men, and many of them imagined that they were fulfilling a heavenly\r\nmission. I have known many worthy and amiable ecclesiastics in Spain and\r\nin Portugal who advocated the inquisition as a useful institution,\r\nalthough they readily admitted that it had too frequently been rendered\r\ninstrumental to ambition and political intrigues.\r\n\r\nThis state of mental exaltation is not unfrequently within the province of\r\na physician's care. The treatment like that of all moral affections is a\r\ntask of great difficulty. Perhaps the best curative means to be adopted is\r\noccupation of the body in active pursuits. St. Augustine was so convinced\r\nof this necessity of occupation to prevent ecstatic habits, that the monks\r\nof the Thebaid cultivated their ground with such industry, that they\r\nfreighted several vessels with their produce. Priest has observed in his\r\nextensive practice in insanity that he never met with an insane\r\nnaturalist. Travelling is also to be enjoined. Marriage has also been\r\nadvised, although it is to be feared that the little charms men of this\r\ndescription may have to suit a woman's fancy, might lead to contemplation\r\nof a nature widely different from beatitude. The Jewish Rabbi tell us,\r\nthat as soon as Moses became contemplative and prophetic, his wife\r\nMarjarin left him. It is certain that enthusiasm produces a concentration\r\nof mind prejudicial to all other functions.[5]\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that melancholy or intense cogitation may bring on this\r\nmorbid condition. Zimmerman relates that the mathematician Viote was\r\nsometimes so wrapped up in calculation, that he was known to remain three\r\ndays and three nights without sleep or food: and Mendelsohn the\r\nphilosopher, who was called the Plato of Germany, fell into a swoon the\r\nmoment philosophy was talked of; and he was therefore ordered by his\r\ndoctor not to think. Being asked one day what he contrived to do when not\r\nallowed thought, he replied, \"Why, I go to the window and count the tiles\r\non the roof of the opposite house.\"\r\n\r\nThis morbid condition of our intellectual faculties has been admirably\r\ndescribed by Johnson, in his Rasselas. \"To indulge the power of fiction,\r\nand send imagination out upon the wing, is often the sport of those who\r\ndelight too much in silent speculation. He who has nothing external that\r\ncan divert him, must find pleasure in his own thoughts, and must conceive\r\nhimself what he is not; for who is pleased with what he is? He then\r\nexpatiates in boundless futurity, and culls from all imaginary conditions\r\nthat which for the present moment he would most desire; amuses his desires\r\nwith impossible enjoyments, and confers upon his pride unattainable\r\ndominion. The mind dances from scene to scene, unites all pleasures, in\r\nall combinations, and riots in delights which nature and fortune, with all\r\ntheir bounty cannot bestow. In time, some particular train of ideas fixes\r\nthe attention: all other intellectual gratifications are rejected; the\r\nmind, in weariness or leisure, returns constantly to the favourite\r\nconception, and feasts on the luscious falsehood whenever she is offended\r\nwith the bitterness of truth. By degrees the reign of fancy is confirmed;\r\nshe grows first imperious, and in time despotic. Then fictions begin to\r\noperate as realities, false opinions fasten upon the mind, and life passes\r\nin dreams of raptures or of anguish.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated physician Boerhaave was once engaged in so profound a\r\nmeditation that he did not close his eyes for six weeks. Any fixity of\r\nidea may be considered as a monomania. Pascal, being thrown down on a\r\nbridge, fancied ever after that he was standing on the brink of a terrific\r\nprecipice, which appeared to him an abyss ever ready to ingulf him. So\r\nimmutable was this dread, that when his friends conversed with him they\r\nwere obliged to conceal this ideal peril with a chair, on which they\r\nseated themselves, to tranquillize his perturbed mind. This is an\r\ninstance of a painful fixity of thought, the result of which is\r\nmelancholic mania; whereas ecstatic exultation is the enjoyment of a\r\ndelicious sensation unknown in our habitual earthly enjoyments, and\r\nbeautifully expressed by Shakspeare, when Pericles thus addresses\r\nHelicamus--\r\n\r\n  O Helicanus! strike me, honoured sir;\r\n  Give me a gash,--put me to present pain,\r\n  Lest this great sea of joy, rushing upon me,\r\n  O'erbear the shores of my mortality,\r\n  And drown me with their sweetness.\r\n\r\nArchimides was heedless of the slaughter around him. Father Castel, the\r\ninventor of the ocular harpsichord, spent an entire night in one position,\r\nruminating on a thought that struck him as he was retiring to rest. And it\r\nis related of an arduous student, that he was reflecting so deeply on some\r\ninteresting and puzzling subject, that he did not perceive that his feet\r\nwere burnt by the fire near which he was seated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETIES OF MANKIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most approved classification of mankind is that of Blumenbach. He\r\ndivides them into five varieties: 1. The Caucasian; 2. Mongolian; 3.\r\nEthiopian; 4. American; and 5. Malay: and the following are the\r\ncharacteristics of each.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE CAUCASIAN.\r\n\r\nThe skin white; the cheeks rosy--almost a peculiarity of this variety; the\r\nhair of a nut-brown, running on the one hand to yellow, on the other into\r\nblack, soft, long, and undulating; the head symmetrical, rather globular;\r\nthe forehead moderately expanded; the cheek-bones narrow, not prominent;\r\nthe alveolar edge round, the front teeth of each jaw placed\r\nperpendicularly. The face oval and pretty straight; its features\r\nmoderately distinct; the nose narrow and slightly aquiline, the bridge of\r\nit rather prominent; the mouth small; the lips, especially the lower,\r\ngently turned out; the chin full and round. This variety comprehends all\r\nEuropeans, except the Laplander and the rest of the Finnish race; the\r\nWestern Asiatics as far as the Obi, the Caspian, and the Ganges; and the\r\npeople of the North of Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE MONGOLIAN.\r\n\r\nSkin of an olive colour; the hair black, stiff, straight, and sparing. The\r\nhead almost square, the cheek-bones prominent outwards; the superciliary\r\narches scarcely perceptible; the osseous nostrils narrow; the alveolar\r\nedge arched obtusely forward; the chin somewhat projecting. The face broad\r\nand flattened, and its parts consequently less distinct; the space between\r\nthe eyebrows very broad as well as flat, the cheeks not only projecting\r\noutward, but nearly globular; the aperture of the eyelids narrow and\r\nlinear; the nose small and flat.\r\n\r\nThis comprehends the remaining Asiatics, except the Malays of the\r\nextremity of the Transgangetic Peninsula, the Finnish races of the North\r\nof Europe, Laplanders, &c., and the Esquimaux, diffused over the most\r\nnorthern parts of America, from Behring's Strait to the farthest habitable\r\npoint of Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE ETHIOPIAN.\r\n\r\nSkin black; the hair black and crisp. Head narrow, compressed laterally;\r\nforehead arched; the cheek-bones projecting; the osseous nostrils large,\r\nthe jaws lengthened forward; the alveolar edge narrow, elongated, more\r\nelliptical; the upper front teeth obliquely prominent, the lower jaw large\r\nand strong; the skull thick and heavy; the face narrow, and projecting at\r\nits lower part; the eyes prominent; the nose thick and confused with the\r\nprojecting cheeks; the lips, especially the upper, thick; the chin\r\nsomewhat receding; the legs in many instances bowed.\r\n\r\nThis comprehends the inhabitants of Africa, with the exception of the\r\nCaucasian variety which inhabits the northern parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. THE AMERICAN.\r\n\r\nSkin of a copper colour; hair black, stiff, straight, and sparing.\r\nForehead short; cheek-bones broad, but more arched and rounded than in the\r\nMongolian variety; the orbits generally deep; the forehead and vertex\r\nfrequently deformed by art; cranium usually light. The face broad, with\r\nprominent cheeks, not flattened, but with every part distinctly marked if\r\nviewed in profile; the eyes deep; the nose rather flat, but still\r\nprominent.\r\n\r\nThis comprehends all the American, excepting the Esquimaux.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE MALAY.\r\n\r\nSkin tawny; hair black, soft, curled, thick, and abundant; head rather\r\nnarrow; forehead slightly arched; cheek-bones not prominent, upper jaw\r\nrather projecting. Face prominent at its lower part; the features viewed\r\nin profile more distinct; the nose full, broad, bottled at its point;\r\nmouth large.\r\n\r\nThis comprehends the inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean, of the Marian,\r\nPhilippine, Molucca, and Sunda isles, and of the Peninsula of Malacca.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Caucasian variety derives its name from _Mount Caucasus_, where we\r\nmeet with a beautiful race--the Georgians; and because, so far as the\r\nimperfect light of history and tradition can guide us, the original abode\r\nof the species appears to have been in that quarter. In this class are\r\nincluded all the ancient and modern Europeans; the Assyrians, Medes,\r\nChaldeans, Sarmatians, Scythians, and Parthians; the Philistines,\r\nPhoenicians, Jews; the Turks, Persians, Arabians, and Hindoos of high\r\ncaste. Blumenbach is inclined to believe that the primitive human race\r\nbelonged to this variety. In support of this opinion it may be stated,\r\nthat the part of Asia which seems to have been the cradle of the race has\r\nalways been, and still is, inhabited by tribes of this formation; and the\r\ninhabitants of Europe in great part may be traced back for their origin to\r\nthe West of Asia.\r\n\r\nAre all these various tribes, brethren descended from one stock? or must\r\nwe trace them to more than one? The physiologists who have ventured to\r\nexpress the latter opinion have been stigmatized by intolerance and blind\r\nbigotry as atheists and unbelievers; yet this question belongs to the\r\ndomain of the naturalist, and the philosopher has an unqualified right to\r\nmoot it without incurring the heinous charge of infidelity. To form an\r\nopinion on this difficult subject, it will be necessary, as Lawrence\r\njustly observes, to ascertain carefully all the differences that exist\r\nbetween the various races of men; to compare them with the diversities\r\nobserved among animals; to apply to them all the light which human and\r\ncomparative physiology can supply, and to draw our inferences concerning\r\ntheir nature and causes from all the direct information and all the\r\nanalogies which these considerations may unfold. \"It is quite clear,\"\r\ncontinues the same ingenious writer, \"that the Mosaic account makes all\r\nthe inhabitants of the world descended from _Adam_ and _Eve_. The entire,\r\nor even the partial inspiration of the various writings comprehended in\r\nthe Old Testament, has been and is doubted by many persons, including\r\nlearned divines and distinguished Oriental and Biblical scholars. The\r\naccount of the creation, and subsequent events, has the allegorical\r\nfigurative character common to Eastern compositions, and it is\r\ndistinguished amongst the cosmogonies by a simple grandeur and natural\r\nsublimity, as the rest of these writings are by appropriate beauties in\r\ntheir respective parts. The representation of all the animals being\r\nbrought before Adam in the first instance, and subsequently of their all\r\nbeing collected in the ark, if we are to understand them as applied to the\r\nliving inhabitants of the whole world, is zoologically impossible. How\r\ncould the polar bear have traversed the torrid zone? If we are to believe\r\nthat the original creation comprehended only a male and female of each\r\nspecies, or that one pair only was saved from an universal deluge, the\r\ndifficulties are increased; the carnivorous animals must have perished\r\nwith hunger, or destroyed most of the other species.\" On this obscure\r\nsubject Adelung has expressed himself with much ingenuity: \"Asia has been\r\nat all times regarded as the country where the human race had its\r\nbeginning, and from which its increase was spread over the rest of the\r\nglobe. Tracing the people up to tribes, and the tribes to families, we are\r\nconducted at last, if not by history, at least by the tradition of all old\r\npeople, to a single pair, from which tribes and nations have been\r\nsuccessively produced. What was the first family, and the first people\r\ndescended from it?--where was it settled?--and how was it extended so as\r\nto fill the four large divisions of the globe? It is a question of fact,\r\nand must be answered by History. But History is silent: her first books\r\nhave been destroyed by time; and the few lines preserved by _Moses_ are\r\nrather calculated to excite than to satisfy our curiosity.\r\n\r\n\"We must fancy to ourselves this first tribe endowed with all human\r\nfaculties, but not possessing all knowledge and experience, the subsequent\r\nacquisition of which is left to the natural operation of time and\r\ncircumstances. As Nature would not unnecessarily expose her first-born and\r\ninexperienced son to conflicts and dangers, the place of his early abode\r\nwould be so selected that all his wants could be easily satisfied, and\r\nevery thing essential to his existence be readily procured. He would be\r\nplaced, in short, in a garden of paradise. Such a country is found in\r\ncentral Asia, between the 30th and 50th degrees of north latitude, and the\r\n90th and 110th of east longitude (from Ferro); a spot which in respect to\r\nits height, can only be compared to the lofty plains of Quito in South\r\nAmerica. Here, too, all the animals are found wild, which man has tamed\r\nfor his use, and carried with him over the whole earth.\"\r\n\r\nThis ingenious historical investigation points out the east as the\r\nearliest and original seat of our species, the source of our domesticated\r\nanimals and our principal vegetable food; but it by no means decides\r\nwhether the globe was peopled by one or several original stocks.\r\n\r\nThe startling nature of this question on the first view of the subject\r\nmust induce us to consider the circumstance of these five distinct\r\nvarieties arising from one stock as miraculous; but when we compare them\r\nwith the corresponding difference in animals, we can easily come to the\r\nconclusion that the various races of human beings are only to be regarded\r\nas varieties of a single species, without supposing the intervention of\r\nany supernatural agency.\r\n\r\nThe sceptic Voltaire, who evinced more wit than learning in his endeavours\r\nto invalidate Scriptural tradition by ridicule, thus expresses himself:\r\n\"Il n'est permis qu'a un aveugle de douter que les blancs, les negres, les\r\nalbinos, les Hottentots, les Lapons, les Chinois, les Americains, soient\r\ndes races entierement differentes;\" but had this philosopher been better\r\nversed in zoology and physiology, he would not have made so groundless an\r\nassertion. \"Analogical and direct facts,\" says Dr. Elliotson, \"lead to the\r\nconclusion that none of the differences among mankind are so great as to\r\nrequire the belief of their originality.\" A contrary opinion, however,\r\nshould not be stigmatized by bigotry, for Locke has justly observed that\r\nonly matters above human reason are the proper subjects of revelation; and\r\nBacon has also maintained that religious and philosophical inquiries\r\nshould be kept separate, and not pompously united. Dr. Bostock, than whom\r\nno man could be less sceptical, plainly admits that we do not find that\r\nthe writer of the book of Genesis lays claim to any supernatural source of\r\ninformation with respect to natural phenomena, while the whole tenour of\r\nhis work seems to show that on such topics he adopted the opinions which\r\nwere current among his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the difference of our species have been the subject of as\r\ngreat a discrepance in opinion. Most of the Greek and Roman Historians\r\nhave attributed it to the influence of climate; and amongst the moderns,\r\nMontaigne, Montesquieu, Buffon, and Zimmerman, have considered the\r\nmodification of the individual and the degeneration of the offspring as\r\nthe result of this external agency. Lord Kaimes, Hume, and many other\r\nphilosophers, have entertained a contrary opinion. No doubt, the influence\r\nof climate may materially affect colour, stature, hair, features, and even\r\nthe moral and intellectual character; but it must be considered as\r\ninadequate to act upon conformation. The prevalence of light colours in\r\nthe animals of polar regions is well known: the arctic fox, the white\r\nbear, the snow-bunting, are striking instances of this peculiarity; but\r\nthese circumstances are purely superficial. The skulls of these\r\nindividuals are similar to those of the Europeans; nay, it is well known\r\nthat light races are found among dark nations, and many protected parts of\r\nthe body are blacker than those which are exposed. Buchanan tells us, that\r\nthe Jews in Cochin are divided into white and black classes, though born\r\nunder the same parallel; the white Jews having been known there for\r\nupwards of one thousand seven hundred years. Dr. Shaw and Bruce describe a\r\nrace of fair people, near Mount Aurasius in Africa, with red hair and blue\r\neyes, and who are, according to tradition, descended from the Vandals. We\r\nfind the red Peruvian, the brown Malay, and the white Abyssinian in the\r\nvery zones peopled by jet black races. This influence of temperature upon\r\ncolour frequently varies according to the seasons. Pallas observed that\r\neven in domestic animals, such as the horse and cow, the coat is of a\r\nlighter colour in winter. The Siberian roe, red in summer, is white in the\r\nwinter; the fur of the sable and the martin is much deeper in the warm\r\nmonths; and the squirrel and mustela nivalis, which become white in\r\nSiberia and Russia, do not change their hue in Germany. The winter coat,\r\nit has been observed by naturalists, is found far advanced in the\r\npreparatory autumn. This bounteous provision of nature seems to have been\r\nextended to the vegetable kingdom and it has been observed that the\r\npellicle of onions is much thicker on the approach of a severe winter than\r\non that of a more temperate season. But if further proof were necessary to\r\nimpugn this doctrine respecting climate, we may adduce the fact of a woman\r\nhaving borne twins of different complexions, a white and a black. With all\r\ndue respect to the much-lamented Bishop Heber, we must receive with some\r\ndegree of hesitation his assertion that the Persian, Greek, Tartar, and\r\nArabian inhabitants of India, assume, in a few generations, without any\r\nintercourse with the Hindoos, a deep blue tint, little lighter than that\r\nof a negro; and that the Portuguese, during three hundred years' residence\r\nin that climate, have assumed the blackness of a Kaffer. The same learned\r\nprelate is of opinion that our European complexion was not primitive, but\r\nrather that of an Indian; an intermediate tint is perhaps the most\r\nagreeable to the eye and instinct of the majority of the human race. Dr.\r\nHeber, perhaps, had not seen, in various Roman catholic treasures,\r\nportraits of the Virgin Mary, painted, according to tradition, by St.\r\nLuke, and in which she is represented as a negress.\r\n\r\nThat solar heat produces blackness of the integuments is an ancient\r\nopinion, and is illustrated by Pliny, who tells us, \"Aethiopes vicini\r\nsideris vapore torreri, adustisque similes gigni, barba et capillo\r\nvibrato, non est dubium.\" Buffon asserts that \"climate may be regarded as\r\nthe chief cause of the different colours of man;\" and Smith is of opinion\r\n\"that from the pole to the equator we observe a gradation in the\r\ncomplexion nearly in proportion to the latitude of the country.\"\r\n\r\nBlumenbach, under the same impression, endeavours to account for this\r\nblack tinge by a chemical illustration somewhat curious. He states that\r\nthe proximate cause of the dark colour is an abundance of carbon secreted\r\nby the skin with hydrogen, precipitated and fixed by the contact of the\r\natmospheric oxygen. Our creoles, and the British inhabitants of India, may\r\nesteem themselves particularly fortunate in not being subject to this\r\nchemical operation!\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is well known that a black state of the skin has\r\nbeen produced in white races under peculiar circumstances; and Le Cat and\r\nCamper mention cases of women who turned dark during their pregnancy. It\r\nwould be idle to dwell further on the hypothetic illustrations regarding\r\nthis supposed operation of climate, which the observation of every\r\nunprejudiced traveller can impugn. Yet the following remarks on the\r\nsubject by an American divine, the Rev. J. S. Smith are worthy of notice:\r\n\r\n\"In tracing the globe from the pole to the equator we observe a gradation\r\nin the complexion nearly in proportion to the latitude of the country,\r\nimmediately below the arctic circle a high and sanguine colour prevails.\r\nFrom this you descend to the mixture of red and white. Afterwards comes\r\nthe brown, the blue, the tawny, and at length the black as you proceed to\r\nthe line. The same distance from the sun, however, does not in any degree\r\nindicate the same temperature of climate. Some secondary causes must be\r\ntaken into consideration, in connecting and limiting its influence. The\r\nelevation of the land, its vicinity to the sea, the nature of the soil,\r\nthe state of cultivation, the course of the winds, and many other\r\ncircumstances enter into this view. Elevated and mountainous countries are\r\ncool in proportion to their altitude above the level of the sea,\r\nincreasing to the ocean, just in opposite effects, in northern and\r\nsouthern latitudes; for the ocean being of a more equal temperature than\r\nthe land, in one case corrects the cold, and in the other moderates the\r\nheat. Ranges of mountains, such as the Apennines in Italy, and Taurus,\r\nCaucasen, and Iman, in Asia, by interrupting the course of cold winds,\r\nrender the quite dry country below them warmer, and the countries above\r\nthem colder, than is equivalent to the proportionate difference of\r\nlatitude. The frigid zone, in Asia, is much wider than it is in Europe;\r\nand that continent hardly knows a temperate zone.\"\r\n\r\nClimate also receives some difference from the nature of the soil, and\r\nsome from the degree of cultivation; sand is susceptible of greater heat\r\nthan clay, and an uncultivated region shaded with forests and covered with\r\nundrained marshes, is more frigid in northern and more temperate in\r\nsouthern latitudes, than a country laid open to the direct and constant\r\naction of the sun. History informs us that when Germany and Scythia were\r\nbound in forests, the Romans often transported their armies across the\r\nfrozen Danube; but since the civilization of those barbarous regions, the\r\nDanube rarely freezes.\r\n\r\nMigration to other countries has also been adduced as one of the causes of\r\nvariety in mankind; but the permanency of the characteristic distinctions\r\nof any race militates against this supposition. The physical character of\r\nthe Celts, who peopled the west of Europe at an early period, is still\r\nobservable in the Spaniard, most of the French, the native Welsh, the\r\nManks, and the Scotch Highlander; whereas the German race, who occupied\r\nthe more northern and eastern settlements, are still distinguished by\r\ntheir transparent skin, rosy complexion, flaxen hair, and blue eyes; and\r\nin Ireland, the race of the Danes and the Milesians can to this day be\r\nrecognised in their respective characters. Shaw and Bruce traced the\r\ndescendants of the Vandals who passed from Spain into Africa in the fifth\r\ncentury; and, after a lapse of thirteen centuries, Bruce says that they\r\nare \"fair like the English, their hair red, and their eyes blue.\" Negroes\r\nhave been introduced into the New World for upwards of three centuries,\r\nwhere, despite of a new clime and different habits, they still retain the\r\ncharacter of their race; and the Jews who have not intermarried out of\r\ntheir nation, have preserved their features for nineteen centuries.\r\n\r\nNot only do we observe the peculiarities of physical conformation\r\nresisting the destructive or degenerating hand of time, but certain\r\nimperfections in their faculties have been equally permanent in certain\r\ntribes. It is a curious fact that the Mamelukes, who have resided in Egypt\r\nfor upwards of five hundred and fifty years, have never perpetuated their\r\nsubsisting issue. Volney observed, that there does not exist one single\r\nfamily of them in the second generation; all their children perishing in\r\nthe first or second descent. The same observation applies to the Turks,\r\nwho can only secure the continuance of their families by marrying native\r\nwomen, an union which the Mamelukes disdained. This singularity, remarked\r\nby Volney, has been since confirmed by late travellers.\r\n\r\nIt will be found that the progress of domestication, the natural result of\r\ncivilized improvement, tends more materially to operate a wonderful change\r\nin the animal conformation, than any other supposed agency. The head of\r\nthe domestic pig differs as much from that of the wild one as the Negro's\r\nfrom the Caucasian's. At Padua, it has been observed that fowls have a\r\ncranium perforated by numerous holes, and hollowed out like a shell. In\r\nsome countries, nay districts, cattle and sheep have or have not horns;\r\nand in other instances sheep have so many of them as to have acquired the\r\nepithet of _polycerateous_. Wild animals continuing to inhabit the place\r\nthat bore them, undergo little or no change, and their fossil remains and\r\nskeletons are similar to the present species; but nothing can form a\r\nstronger contrast to this specific uniformity than the numerous varieties\r\nto be found in those races that have been crossed in breed and\r\ndomesticated by man. We could scarcely imagine that our sheep owe their\r\norigin to the mouflon or argali, (_ovis ammon_,) an animal large in size,\r\nfleet, and fierce. The sheep of Senegal and India are those that have\r\nundergone the least degradation; while those of Barbary, Egypt, Arabia,\r\nand Persia, have experienced greater degeneration. We daily see dogs\r\ndegenerate before our eyes, and it has not yet been satisfactorily\r\nascertained whether they arise from one or several species. Cuvier, in his\r\ndiligent researches, has concluded that our oxen do not originate in the\r\nurus or bison of the ancients formerly found in various parts of Europe,\r\nand still met with in the forests of Lithuania, and on the Carpathian and\r\nCaucasian chains; but he is of opinion, from the examination of fossil\r\nremains, that, like the camel and the dromedary, the species has been\r\ndestroyed by civilization: the causes of these changes do not appear to\r\noperate by altering the parents but disposing them to produce offsprings\r\nmore or less dissimilar in colour, form, and disposition.\r\n\r\nDr. Prichard observes, that the negro slaves of the third and fourth\r\ngeneration differ materially from the natives of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn opposition to this doctrine, which admits this wonderful degeneration\r\nunder the plastic influence of domestication, it has been shown that, as\r\nfar as we know, the lapse of ages has not produced any change in the\r\ngenerality of animals. The zoological descriptions given by Aristotle\r\ntwenty-two centuries ago apply distinctly to the same species of the\r\npresent day, and every work of art in which these animals are represented\r\ncorroborates the fact. Geoffroy de St. Hilaire brought numerous mummies of\r\nanimals from the sepulchres of Egypt, and found no more difference between\r\ntheir skeletons and the osseous conformation of the present races, than in\r\nthe relics of the human mummy and the bones of our contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe following luminous conclusion of Lawrence illustrates the observation\r\nof the foregoing fact: \"If new characters are produced in the domestic\r\nanimals because they have been taken from their primitive condition, and\r\nexposed to the operation of many, to them, unnatural causes,--if the pig\r\nis remarkable among these for the number and degrees of his varieties,\r\nbecause it has been the most exposed to causes of degeneration,--we shall\r\nbe at no loss to account for the diversities in man, who is, in the true,\r\nthough not in the ordinary sense of the word, more of a domesticated\r\nanimal than any other. We know the wild state of most of them, but we are\r\nignorant of the natural wild condition to which man was destined. Probably\r\nthere is no such state; because Nature having limited him in no\r\nrespect,--having fitted him for every kind of life, every climate, and\r\nevery variety of food,--has given him the whole earth for his abode, and\r\nboth the organized kingdoms for his nourishment. Yet, in the wide range\r\nthrough which the scale of human cultivation extends, we may observe a\r\ncontrast between the two extremities, analogous to that which is seen in\r\nthe wild and tamed races of animals. The savage may be compared to the\r\nformer, which range the earth uncontrolled by man; civilized people to the\r\ndomesticated breeds of the same species, whose diversities of form and\r\ncolour are endless.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore obvious that the various causes which operate upon animals\r\nin producing these alterations from the primitive race, although the\r\nmanner in which they act is unknown, are sufficiently evident to convince\r\nus, by analogy, that they may account for similar phenomena in the human\r\nrace, without the gratuitous assumption of different original species,\r\ntending to invalidate the Mosaic account of the creation. Despite the\r\nwitticisms of Voltaire and other philosophers on this subject, sound\r\nphilosophy teaches us to assign the same causes to the same effects\r\nwithout calling in the adventitious aid of other possible influences; and\r\nno difficulties prevent us from recognising the unity of the human\r\nspecies, which are not applicable to all other animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE INHUMATION OF THE DEAD IN CITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial, medical men have strongly pointed out to municipal\r\nauthorities the dangers that arise from burying the dead within the\r\nprecincts of cities or populous towns. Impressed with the same conviction,\r\nancient legislators only allowed to the most illustrious citizens a\r\nsepulchre in the temple of the gods. Euclides was interred in the temple\r\nof Diana Euclis, as a reward for his pious journey to Delphi in search of\r\nthe sacred fire; the Magnesians erected a monument to Themistocles in\r\ntheir forum; Euphron received the same honour in Corinth; and Medea buried\r\nher two sons, Mermerus and Pheres, under the protection of Juno Acraea's\r\naltars, to guard their ashes from their persecutors. Lycurgus was perhaps\r\nthe only Grecian legislator who recommended inhumation in temples and in\r\ncities, to accustom youth to the daily spectacle of death.\r\n\r\nThe primitive Grecians, it appears, buried their dead in or about their\r\ndwellings; and we find a law amongst the Thebans, ordaining that every\r\nperson who built a house should provide a repository for the dead upon his\r\npremises. In latter days, both Grecians and Romans erected their tombs\r\noutside of their cities, and chiefly by the road-side. It appears also,\r\nthat, among the Romans, the bodies of the lower orders were promiscuously\r\ncast into wells, called _fruticuli_. Horace seems to allude to this\r\npractice. _Hoc miserae plebi stabat commune sepulchrum._ The funerals of\r\nthe wealthy patricians appear to have been most sumptuous and costly, the\r\npall formed of valuable materials and decorated with splendid ornaments.\r\nThus Statius:\r\n\r\n_Ditantur flammae: non unquam opulentioan ille ante cinis: crepitant gemmae:\r\natque immane litescit argentum, et pietis exsudat vestibus aurum._ The\r\nlaws of the twelve tables prohibited the practice of this waste of gold.\r\n\r\nBoth religious and civil motives might have dictated the propriety of this\r\nregulation. The traveller, setting out upon a journey, and passing by the\r\nsepulchres of his sires, could in the presence of their manes invoke their\r\nprotection; and on his return to his penates, safe from danger, he could\r\nput up thanks to the gods for his preservation. As a prudential measure,\r\nthe interment of the dead beyond the walls of their towns prevented the\r\nfatal consequences that might have arisen from extensive putrefaction and\r\ninfection, and moreover the burning of bodies would have exposed the\r\nadjoining buildings to the danger of frequent fires. It is also possible\r\nthat policy dictated these sanatory enactments. The ancients held the\r\nremains of the departed as a sacred trust, in the defence of which they\r\nwere ever prepared to fall; and it is not improbable that their warriors\r\nwould have rushed forth to meet the invader, before he would have defiled,\r\nby his approach to their cities, the ashes of their ancestors. So\r\nscrupulously religious were the Athenians in performing the funeral rites\r\nof the dead, that they put to death ten of their commanders, after the\r\nbattle of Arginusae, for not having committed to the earth the dead bodies\r\nthat floated on the waters. Such was the dread of being deprived of\r\nsepulchral rites, that it is related of several citizens of Cappadocia,\r\nthat during the pestilence that devastated their town in the reign of\r\nGallus and Valerian, they actually shut themselves up to perish in their\r\ntombs.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that their dead were buried in such a manner as not\r\nto prove injurious to the survivors; and Seneca plainly says, \"Non\r\ndefunctorum causa, sed vivorum, inventa est sepultura.\" The ancients both\r\nburned and buried their dead, but inhumation appears to have been the\r\nmost early and the most approved rite. \"Let the dead be buried,\" says a\r\nlaw of Cecrops. Solon justifies the claims of the Athenians to the island\r\nof Salamis, from the circumstance of the dead bodies interred on its\r\nshores having been inhumed according to the Athenian custom, with their\r\nfeet turned to the west, whereas the Megarensians turned theirs to the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nIn various instances the burial or the burning appear to have been adopted\r\nupon philosophical doctrines. Democritus, with a view to facilitate\r\nresurrection, recommended interment, and Pliny thus ridicules the\r\nintention: \"Similis et de asservandis corporibus hominum, et reviviscendis\r\npromissa a Democrito vanitas, qui non revivixit ipse.\" Heraclitus, who\r\nconsidered fire as the first principle, advocated the funeral pile; while\r\nThales, who deemed water the chief element, urged the propriety of\r\ncommitting the departed to the damp bosom of the earth. Although burning\r\nthe dead was customary, there were curious exceptions to the rule. Infants\r\nwho died before cutting their teeth, persons struck dead with lightning,\r\nwere buried. The place of interment of infants was called the\r\n_suggrundarium_.\r\n\r\nThe early Christians inhumed the bodies of their martyrs in their temples.\r\nThis honour was afterwards conferred on the remains of distinguished\r\ncitizens, illustrious prelates, and princes. The infectious diseases which\r\nat various periods arose from this custom, induced Theodosius, in his\r\ncelebrated code, strictly to prohibit it; and he even ordered that the\r\nremains of the dead thus inhumed should be removed out of Rome. The vanity\r\nof man, and the cupidity of the priesthood, soon overruled these wise\r\nregulations. Every family possessing sufficient means, claimed a vault\r\nwithin the churches, and thereby the revenues of the clergy were\r\nmaterially increased. At all times, even the dead appeared to have shared\r\nwith the living the obligation of supporting the ministers of the altar.\r\nBy a law of Hippias, the priestesses of Minerva received a choenix[6] of\r\nwheat, and one of barley, with an obolus, for every individual who\r\ndeparted this life. The _libitinarii_ of the Romans fulfilled the duties\r\nof our undertakers, or rather of the directors of funeral pomp of the\r\nFrench; yet they were attached to the temple of the goddess Libitina,\r\nwhose priests received a fee in silver for every one who died, under the\r\nname of _Libitinae ratio_. Suetonius informs us, that in Nero's time the\r\nmortality was so great during one autumn, that thirty thousand of these\r\nsilver pieces were deposited in the fatal treasury. To increase the\r\nemoluments of this sacerdotal body, these _libitinarii_ sold at high\r\nprices every thing that was requisite for the funeral ceremonies, received\r\na toll at the city gate through which the bodies were carried out, as well\r\nas at the entrance of the amphitheatre through which the dead gladiators\r\nwere borne away. Phaedrus alludes to this speculation in one of his fables,\r\nwhen speaking of a miser,\r\n\r\n  Qui circumcidis omnem impensam funeris,\r\n  Libitina ne quid de tuo faciat lucrum.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that this avaricious divinity owed her name to the\r\ndispleasure which it must have occasioned to all who heard it,--_quod\r\nnemini libeat_; but it is also possible that it was derived from her\r\nbearing poor mortals away, whenever she fancied it, and _ad libitum_.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, Theodolphus, Bishop of Orleans, complained to\r\nCharlemagne that lucre and vanity had converted churches into\r\ncharnel-houses, disgraceful to the clergy and perilous to the community.\r\nIt was upon this representation that this prince, in his capitularies,\r\nprohibited burials in churches under heavy penalties. But the laws of the\r\nwisest could not prevent priesthood from considering this source of\r\nemolument, although endangering public salubrity, an indisputable property\r\nthat could not be meddled with without endangering the church.\r\n\r\nIn England the custom of burying the dead in churches was first sanctioned\r\nby Cuthbert, Archbishop of Canterbury, in 758, it having been previously\r\nforbidden by Augustine, who had decreed that no corpse either of prince or\r\nprelate should be buried within the walls of a city.\r\n\r\nIn France, Maret in 1773, and Vicq d'Azyr in 1778, pointed out the danger\r\nof this practice in such glaring colours, that government by an edict,\r\nonly allowed church interment to certain dignitaries; but in 1804, by a\r\nwise law that should be enforced in every civilized country, inhumation in\r\ncities was entirely abolished. Amongst the numerous well authenticated\r\nevil results of burying in churches that led to this wise prohibition, the\r\nfollowing were the most striking and circumstantial:\r\n\r\nIn 1773, in Saulieu, Burgundy, an epidemic disease arising from the\r\ninhumation of a corpse in the church of St. Saturnin created considerable\r\nalarm. The body of a corpulent person had been interred on the 3d of\r\nMarch, and a woman was buried near it on the 20th of April following: both\r\nhad died of a reigning fever. During the last burial a fetid effluvia\r\narose from the vault, which pervaded the whole church; and, out of one\r\nhundred and seventy persons who were present, one hundred and forty-nine\r\nwere attacked with the prevailing malady, although its progress had been\r\narrested amongst the other inhabitants of the town.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, a similar accident occurred in a village near Nantes, where\r\nseveral coffins were removed in a vault, to make room for the lord of the\r\nmanor: fifteen of the bystanders died from the emanation.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, one-third of the inhabitants of Lectouse perished from a fever of\r\na malignant character that manifested itself after some works that\r\nrequired the removal of a burial-ground. Two destructive epidemics swept\r\naway large proportions of the population of Riom and Ambert, two towns in\r\nAuvergne.\r\n\r\nTaking this matter under consideration in a moral, or even a religious\r\nlight, it may be questioned whether any advantage can accrue from the\r\ncontinuance of this pernicious custom, which during the prevalence of\r\nepidemic diseases endangers the life of every person who resides near a\r\nchurch. Does it add to the respect which the remains of the dead are\r\nentitled to? Certainly not: the constant tolling of \"the sullen bell\"--the\r\ndaily cortege of death that passes before us--the graves that we hourly\r\ncontemplate, perusing monumental records which more frequently excite\r\nunseasonable laughter than serious reflection--every thing, in short,\r\ntends to make death of little or no moment, except to those who have heard\r\nthe mutes gossiping at their door. So accustomed, indeed, are we from our\r\nchildhood to sepulchral scenes, that, were it not for the parish-officers,\r\nour churchyards would become the playground of every truant urchin; and\r\nhow often do we behold human bones become sportive baubles in the wanton\r\npranks of the idlers, who group around the gravedigger's preparations! So\r\ncallous are we to all feelings of religious awe when surrounded with the\r\ndead, that our cemeteries are not unfrequently made the rendezvous of\r\nlicentiousness and the assembly-ground of crime, where thieves cast lots\r\nupon a tomb for the division of their spoil.\r\n\r\nWith what different feelings does the traveller wander over the cemetery\r\nof _Pere la Chaise_? I am well aware that many of the gewgaw attributes\r\nthat there decorate the grave, have been called the \"_frippery_,\" \"_the\r\nfoppery_\" of grief; but does there exist a generous, a noble sentiment,\r\nthat may not be perverted by interested motives and hypocrisy into\r\ncontemptible professions? How often is the sublime rendered ridiculous by\r\nbad taste and hyperbolic affectation! When we behold the fond lover\r\npressing to his lips a lock of hair, or the portrait of all that he holds\r\ndear, the cold calculating egotist may call this the _frippery of love_;\r\nbut the stoic who thinks thus, has never known the \"sweet pangs\" of\r\nrequited affection, when, in bitter absence, the recollection of bliss\r\ngone by, imbodies in our imagination the form we once pressed to our\r\nrespondent heart. The creation of our busy fancy stands before us, gazing\r\non us with that tender look that in happier days greeted the hour of\r\nmeeting; or trembles in our tears as when we last parted--to meet,\r\nperhaps, no more! With what fervour of religious love do we not behold the\r\nsimple girl kneeling with uplift eye and hand on the green sod that covers\r\nall that endeared her to existence, till, overwhelmed with burning,\r\nchoking regrets--as idle as they are uncontrollable--she sinks prostrate\r\non the cold earth that now shrouds that bosom which once nestled her young\r\nhopes and fears! There have I seen the pale, the haggard youth,--to all\r\nappearances a student,--seated mournfully by the side of a tomb, absorbed\r\nin deep thought, heedless of the idlers who passed by him, looking at him\r\nperhaps with contempt!--heedless of the swift flight of time, which\r\nshrouded him imperceptibly in darkness, until he was warned by the\r\nguardian of the dead that it was time to depart--and to depart _alone_! No\r\ninscription recorded the \"one loved name;\" he would not expose it to the\r\nunfeeling gaze of the heartless tourist: all he would willingly have\r\ntraced upon her tomb, would have been \"Here lies _my own_!\"\r\n\r\nThe mouldering earth, the fleshless skeleton over which he mourns, cannot\r\nobliterate the remembrance of what she was: though her eyes, perhaps, no\r\nlonger exist, still their former languid, liquid look of bliss, beams\r\nfreshly in his recollection. The lips which once pronounced the long\r\nwished-for avowal of mutual love are still moist and open to memory's\r\nembrace--still seem to lisp the delicious _tu_! Our language is rich,\r\nwithout comparison richer far than the French; but we have nothing so\r\nendearing, so bewitching, as their _tu-toiement_: our _thee's_ and\r\n_thou's_ are frigid, chilly, when compared to the _first toi_ that escapes\r\ninadvertently from beloved lips! A French writer has beautifully expressed\r\nthis exquisite moment: \"Le _premier tu_ est tout-puissant; c'est le _fiat\r\nlux_ de l'ame; il est sublime, il debrouille le chaos!\"\r\n\r\nSublime are the words, \"Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord!\" Would\r\nit be irreligious to say, \"Happy are the dead who die beloved?\" Their fond\r\nand ardent heart had never been chilled by the withering hand of\r\ninfidelity and ingratitude. They died in an ecstatic dream of perfect\r\nbliss on earth, and never were awakened to the world's mocking\r\nrealities!--they died when they felt and believed in their heart of hearts\r\nthat they were dearly beloved--could not be loved more dearly: with that\r\nconviction, death, in a worldly acceptation, can never be untimely.\r\nProbably, they died still sufficiently animated by a latent, lingering\r\nspark of life, to press the hand that was so often linked in mutual\r\npressure in happy days--to feel the burning tear of anguish drop on the\r\npale cheek--to hear the sad, the awful, last word, _a Dieu!_--an\r\nexpression that habit has rendered trivial, but which bears with it, in\r\nthe tenderest solicitude, the most hallowed meaning; since, in pronouncing\r\nit, we leave all that we cherish under the protection and the safeguard of\r\nOUR GOD.\r\n\r\nAffection deprives death of all horrors. We shrink not from the remains of\r\nwhat we cherished. Despite its impiety, there was something refined in\r\nthat conviction of the ancients, who imagined that in bestowing their\r\nfarewell kiss they inhaled the souls of those they loved. How sweet are\r\nthose lines of Macrobius, originally attributed to Plato!\r\n\r\n  Dum semihulco suavio\r\n  Meum pullum suavior,\r\n  Dulcemque florem spiritus\r\n  Duco ex aperto tramite,\r\n  Animo tunc aegra et saucia\r\n  Cucurrit ad labia mihi!\r\n\r\nOur Shakspeare has quaintly, yet beautifully, described this parting\r\nembrace:\r\n\r\n            And lips, O you\r\n  The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss\r\n  A dateless bargain to engrossing death.\r\n\r\nNor was it only on the dying that the ancients bestowed this mark of\r\nfondness: Tibullus and Propertius tell us, that, as their bodies were laid\r\non the funeral pile, they clasped them in a fond and last embrace.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the painted crosses, the chaplets, the garlands of flowers,\r\nwhich mark the hallowed resting-place of the departed, it may be said that\r\nthey are but romantic and poetical expressions of grief. If it were only\r\nreal grief that expressed itself by outward testimonials, how soon would\r\nmourning be banished as an idle expense!--the \"inky cloak,\" and customary\r\n\"suits of solemn black--the trappings and the suit of woes,\" be laid\r\naside! What a different feeling does the splendid catafalcum, covered with\r\nblack velvet, studded with silver tears, and illumined by thousands of\r\nglaring tapers, excite, when compared with the simple and verdant graves\r\nwhich point out the spot \"where souls do couch in flowers,\" blessed by\r\naffection's tears instead of lustral waters. At all periods, amongst every\r\nnation, flowers and certain trees seem to have been consecrated to the\r\ndead. The Romans planted the wild vine and the box around their tombs.\r\nThus Martial to Alcimenes:\r\n\r\n  Accipe, non Phario nutantia pondera saxo,\r\n    Quae cineri vanus dat ruitura labor,\r\n  Sed fragiles buxos, et opacas palmitis umbras,\r\n    Quaeque virent lacrymis humida prata meis.\r\n\r\nThe wealthy assigned a beauteous garden to their departed favourites, as\r\nin the instance of Augustus and Maecenas. Not only did they suspend\r\ngarlands over their tombs, but scattered flowers around them. Again in\r\nVirgil,\r\n\r\n  Purpureosque jacit flores, ac talia fatur.\r\n\r\nThe same custom prevailed amongst the Grecians, who considered all purple\r\nand white flowers acceptable to the dead. The Thessalian's strewed\r\nAchilles' grave with the immortal amaranth and lilies. Electra complains\r\nthat the tomb of Agamemnon received no myrtle boughs; in short, instances\r\nof this practice are every where to be found. In addition to flowers and\r\nperfumes, ribands and hair were also deposited on their sepulchres.\r\nElectra adorns Agamemnon's tomb with her locks, and Canace laments that\r\nshe had not been able to perform the same rite on her beloved Macareus.\r\nPoets tell us that precious ointments and wines were poured upon their\r\nmonuments; and we find, in Euripides, Helen bidding Hermione to take locks\r\nof her hair, honey mixed with milk, and wine, to the sepulchre of her\r\naunt.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Chinese, to the present day, the cypress and the fir, shade\r\ntheir cemeteries: the former tree, an attribute of Pluto was ever\r\nconsidered funereal, hence called _feralis_; and the _feralia_ were\r\nfestivals in honour of the dead, observed by the Romans. Varro pretends\r\nthat the cypress was called funereal from _funus_, as it emitted an\r\nantiseptic aroma. Pliny and others pretend that it typified the dead,\r\nfrom its never shooting out fresh sprouts when the trunk was hewn down. At\r\nany rate, to this hour, it is planted in burying-grounds in every\r\ncivilized country.\r\n\r\nThe yew-tree has also been considered an emblem of mourning from the\r\nearliest times. The custom of planting it singly appears also to be very\r\nancient. Statius, in his Thebaid, calls it the _solitary yew_. In England,\r\nthe trees planted in churchyards were protected by legal enactments, as\r\nappears by a statute of 35 Edward I. From the scarcity of bow staves, they\r\nhad been frequently despoiled by our numerous archers; and, to meet this\r\nservice, by an enactment of Edward IV. every foreign trader was obliged to\r\nbring in four bow staves for every ton of imported merchandise; Elizabeth,\r\nfrom the scarcity of this important article, put the statute in full\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nLet us then hope, both for the living and the dead, that this custom,\r\nwhich obtains in France and other countries, will be adopted by us,\r\ninstead of becoming the subject of ridicule. It is far more desirable to\r\nsee families repairing to the tomb of the departed on the anniversary of\r\ntheir death, than to behold them daily passing by their remains with cold\r\nindifference.\r\n\r\nIt would scarcely be believed upon the continent of Europe, that to this\r\nvery hour bodies are buried in confined churchyards in the most crowded\r\nand dirty parts of the British metropolis, such as Russel-court,\r\nDrury-lane, and various other similar holes and corners; the rudest\r\nnations were never guilty of such a glaring impropriety. In the kingdom of\r\nSiam, the remains of the opulent are burnt with great ceremony, while the\r\nbodies of the poor are carried out and exposed on mountains: in Ceylon,\r\nthe remains of the indigent are interred in the neighbouring woods; the\r\nrich consumed on gorgeous funeral piles.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese inhume their dead at some distance from their cities and\r\ntowns; it is only the bodies of the rich and noble that are allowed to\r\nremain on the premises of the family. Navarette mentions a curious custom\r\nprevalent in one of their provinces, Chan Si, where, in the event of two\r\nbetrothed persons dying at the same period, they are married while their\r\ncoffins are still in their former dwelling, and afterwards burnt together.\r\nBy the accounts of various travellers, the wealthy Chinese are burnt with\r\ngreat pomp, and their monuments are most curious and expensive. Their\r\nmausoleums are actually halls or grottos, decorated with splendour: and\r\nthey inter with the deceased many articles to which he might have been\r\nattached during life, and that may add to his comforts after death. A\r\ncustom that was more prevalent before the invasion of the Tartars--a comb,\r\na pair of scissars to pare his nails; four little purses, containing the\r\nnail-parings of the defunct, were placed in the coffin, and, amongst the\r\nwealthy, gold coin and jewels were inserted in the mouth. The Hottentots\r\nbury their dead in the wild clefts of rocks and caverns; the Peruvians\r\nbear theirs to the neighbouring hills and mountains. The Greenlanders wrap\r\ntheir dead in furs and skins, and carry them to a considerable distance\r\nfrom their huts. In Kamtschatka and Siberia bodies are covered with snow\r\nin caverns and caves; and the African savages perform the same funeral\r\nrites as the Irish: their dead are carried to the burying-ground, followed\r\nby crowds of relatives and other people, who join the procession,\r\nbellowing and howling most piteously, \"Oh! why did you die? did you want\r\nany thing that was ever denied you?\" and after the funeral the survivors\r\ninvariably get drunk on palm-wine, or any strong liquor they can procure;\r\na custom similar to the _circumpotatio_ of the Romans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBURIED ALIVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery nation, however uncivilized, holds the idea of being buried alive in\r\nconstant dread; the horrors of such a situation cannot be described.\r\nBodies have been found where the miserable victims of precipitation had\r\nactually devoured the flesh of their arms in the agonies of hunger and\r\ndespair. Such was the fate of John Scott and the Emperor Zeno. It is to be\r\nfeared that this melancholy occurrence is more frequent than is supposed,\r\nmore especially in countries where inhumation is speedily resorted to. The\r\nancients were remarkably cautious in this respect, especially when we take\r\ninto consideration the climate of Greece and Rome during the summer\r\nmonths. A law of Greece on this subject directs that \"the corpse should be\r\nlaid out at the relations' pleasure, but that the following morning before\r\ndaylight the funeral procession should take place.\" From various\r\nauthorities, however, it appears that the bodies were kept three, and\r\nsometimes six days. Servius was of opinion that the time for burning\r\nbodies was the eighth day, and the time for burying the tenth; it appears,\r\nhowever, that this was a privilege granted to the wealthy, as the poor\r\nwere consumed the day after their death, a custom alluded to in an epigram\r\nof Callimachus. Among the Romans several days were also allowed to elapse\r\nbefore interment--sometimes seven days; during which, loud cries, in which\r\nthe deceased was called by his name, and the noise of various instruments\r\nresounded near the body; this was called the _conclamatio_, alluded to by\r\nTerence:\r\n\r\n  Desine, jam conclamatum est.\r\n\r\nLucan also alludes to this custom:\r\n\r\n        ----------Sic funere primo\r\n  Attonitae tacuere domus, quam corpora nondum\r\n  Conclamata jacent, noc mater crine soluto\r\n  Exigit ad saevos famularum brachia planctus.\r\n\r\nThe ancients held hasty inhumation in great dread, and grounded their\r\napprehension on various current traditions. Thus Plato remarks the case of\r\na warrior who was left for ten days on the field of battle amongst the\r\ndead, and who came to life when he was being borne to the sepulchre.\r\nAsclepiades restored life to a man who was also consigned to the funeral\r\npile, and Pliny relates the case of Lucius Aviola and Lucius Lamia, who\r\nshowed signs of life upon the pile, but were too much injured to be saved.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many absurd fancies regarding the dead, was the superstitious\r\nbelief of their being able to masticate in their coffin any substance\r\nburied with them. Women more especially were believed to be gifted with\r\nthis _post mortem_ faculty of moving their jaw-bones very loudly. _Claro\r\nsonitu_, says the learned Michael Ranfft, in his curious and elaborate\r\nwork, _de masticatione mortuorum_. In this apprehension, that the deceased\r\nin their hunger might devour their own limbs, articles of food were\r\ninterred with them.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of the Jews, who appear to have been in constant\r\ndread of pestilential disease, the inhumation of the dead were most hasty.\r\nYet in this instance many Rabbi maintain that the Talmud has been\r\nerroneously interpreted, for although it decreed that a night should not\r\nbe allowed to pass before inhumation, it clearly meant that actual death\r\nmust have been ascertained.\r\n\r\nWhile such fears are entertained of suspended animation being taken for\r\ndissolution, it is strange that in some savage tribes the aged are allowed\r\nto perish without any care being taken to prolong their lives. Such is the\r\ncustom of some of the Esquimaux, where old and decrepit creatures are\r\nabandoned in their huts and left to their fate. An ancient tradition\r\nstated that the inhabitants of the Isle of Syria never died of any\r\ndistemper, but dropped into their graves at a certain old age.\r\n\r\nIt would be desirable that in cases where interment is speedily resorted\r\nto, a physician should attend, in order to ascertain that death had\r\nactually taken place. This is seldom practised, from the common saying\r\n\"that it is uncivil on the part of a doctor to visit a dead patient.\"\r\nVarious means are employed to ascertain death: the looking-glass applied\r\nto the mouth of the corpse, to find out whether breath had departed; the\r\ncoldness of the extremities, the falling of the lower jaw, the rigidity of\r\nthe limbs, and various other appearances, are universally known; but in\r\nthe villages of Italy and Portugal, pins and needles are frequently driven\r\nunder the nails, in what is vulgarly called _the quick_, to excite an\r\nexcruciating pain if life should not have fled. The most certain evidence,\r\nwhen bodies are long kept, is most decidedly the commencement of\r\ndecomposition; but, in other cases, the action of the voltaic pile on a\r\nbared muscle is an infallible test.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be feared that on the field of battle and naval actions many\r\nindividuals apparently dead are buried or thrown overboard. The history of\r\nFrancois de Civille, a French captain, who was missing at the siege of\r\nRouen, is rather curious: at the storming of the town he was supposed to\r\nhave been killed, and was thrown, with other bodies, in the ditch, where\r\nhe remained from eleven in the morning to half-past six in the evening;\r\nwhen his servant, observing some latent heat, carried the body into the\r\nhouse. For five days and five nights his master did not exhibit the\r\nslightest sign of life, although the body gradually recovered its warmth.\r\nAt the expiration of this time, the town was carried by assault, and the\r\nservants of an officer belonging to the besiegers, having found the\r\nsupposed corpse of Civille, threw it out of window, with no other covering\r\nthan his shirt. Fortunately for the captain, he had fallen upon a\r\ndunghill, where he remained senseless for three days longer, when his body\r\nwas taken up by his relations for sepulture, and ultimately brought to\r\nlife. What was still more strange, Civille, like Macduff, had been \"from\r\nhis mother's womb untimely ripp'd,\" having been brought into the world by\r\na Caesarean operation, which his mother did not survive; and after his last\r\nwonderful escape he used to sign his name with the addition of \"three\r\ntimes born, three times buried, and three times risen from the dead by the\r\ngrace of God.\"\r\n\r\nThe fate of the unfortunate Abbe Prevost, author of \"Manon Lescaut,\" and\r\nother esteemed novels, was lamentable beyond expression. In passing\r\nthrough the forest of Chantilly, he was seized with an apoplectic fit: the\r\nbody, cold and motionless, was found the following morning, and carried by\r\nsome woodcutters to the village surgeon, who proceeded to open it; it was\r\nduring this terrific operation that the wretched man was roused to a sense\r\nof his miserable condition by the agonies he endured, to expire soon after\r\nin all the complicated horrors of his situation. Various cases are\r\nrecorded where persons remained in a state of apparent death for a\r\nconsiderable time. Cullen mentions an hysterical woman who was deprived of\r\nmovement and sensibility for six days. Licelus knew a nun of Bresia, who,\r\nafter an hysteric attack, continued in an inanimate state for ten days and\r\nnights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe singular fact of persons, more especially individuals who were in the\r\nhabit of indulging in the use of spirituous liquors, having taken fire and\r\nbeen consumed, is authenticated beyond the slightest doubt. Little\r\nconfidence, it is true, can be placed in the reports on this subject which\r\noccasionally appear in the newspapers of different countries; but many\r\ncelebrated practitioners have witnessed and recorded the event, and\r\nphysiologists have endeavoured to account for its causes. The celebrated\r\nLe Cat mentions a woman of Rheims, of the name of Millet, who was found\r\nconsumed at the distance of two feet from her chimney; the room exhibited\r\nno appearance of fire, but of the unfortunate sufferer nothing was found\r\nexcept her skull, the bones of the lower extremities, and some vertebrae. A\r\nservant-girl was accused of the murder, and condemned to death; but on\r\nher appeal, and a subsequent investigation, her innocence was fully\r\nascertained.\r\n\r\nJoseph Battaglia, a surgeon of Ponte Bosio, relates the following\r\ncase:--Don G. Maria Bertholi, a priest of Mount Valerius, went to the fair\r\nof Filetto, and afterwards visited a relation in Fenilo, where he intended\r\nto pass the night. Before retiring to rest, he was left reading his\r\nbreviary; when, shortly afterwards, the family were alarmed by his loud\r\ncries and a strange noise in his chamber. On opening the door, he was\r\nlying prostrate on the floor, and surrounded by flickering flames.\r\nBattaglia was immediately sent for, and on his arrival the unfortunate man\r\nwas found in a most deplorable state. The integuments of the arms and the\r\nback were either consumed or detached in hanging flaps. The sufferer was\r\nsufficiently sensible to give an account of himself. He said that he felt\r\nall of a sudden as if his arm had received a violent blow from a club, and\r\nat the same time he saw scintillations of fire rising from his\r\nshirt-sleeves, which were consumed without having burned the wrists; a\r\nhandkerchief, which he had tied round his shoulders, between the shirt and\r\nthe skin, was intact. His drawers were also sound; but, strange to say,\r\nhis silk skull-cap was burnt, while his hair bore no marks of combustion.\r\nThe unfortunate man only survived the event four days, when mortification\r\nof the burnt parts was most extensive, and the body emitted intolerable\r\nputrid effluvia. The circumstances which attended this case would seem to\r\nwarrant the conclusion that the electric fluid was the chief agent in the\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nBianchini relates the death of the Countess of Cornelia Bandi, of Cesena,\r\nwho was in the habit of using frictions of camphorated spirits. She was\r\nfound consumed close to her bedside. No traces of fire could be observed\r\nin the room--the very lights had been burnt down to their sockets; but the\r\nfurniture, closets, and linen were covered with a grayish soot, damp and\r\nclammy.\r\n\r\nThe Annual Register mentions two facts of a similar nature which occurred\r\nin England, one at Southampton, the other at Coventry. In the transactions\r\nof the Royal Society of London, an extraordinary instance of combustion is\r\nalso recorded. The fact is thus related. Grace Pitt, the wife of a\r\nfishmonger of Ipswich, aged about sixty, had contracted a habit, which she\r\ncontinued for several years, of coming down every night from her bedroom,\r\nhalf dressed, to smoke a pipe. On the night of the 9th of April, 1744,\r\nshe got up from her bed as usual; her daughter who slept with her, did not\r\nperceive she was absent till next morning when she awoke; soon after which\r\nshe put on her clothes, and going down into the kitchen, found her mother\r\nstretched out on her right side, with her head near the grate; the body\r\nextended on the hearth, with the legs on the floor, which were of deal,\r\nhaving the appearance of a log of wood consumed by a fire without any\r\napparent flames. On beholding this spectacle, the girl run in great haste\r\nand poured over her mother's body some water contained in two large\r\nvessels, in order to extinguish the fire, while the fetid odour and smoke\r\nthat exhaled from the body almost suffocated some of the neighbours who\r\nhad hastened to the girl's assistance.\r\n\r\nThe trunk was in some measure incinerated, and resembled a heap of wood\r\ncovered with white ashes. The head, the arms, the legs, and the thighs,\r\nhad also participated in the burning. This woman, it is said, had drank a\r\nlarge quantity of spirituous liquor, in consequence of being overjoyed at\r\nhearing of the return of one of her daughters from Gibraltar. There was no\r\nfire in the grate, and the candle had burnt down to the socket of the\r\ncandlestick, which was close to her. Besides, there were found close to\r\nthe consumed body, the clothes of a child and a paper screen, which had\r\nsustained no injury from the fire. The dress of the woman consisted of a\r\ncotton gown.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that this accident may be attributed to the escape of\r\nhydrogen gas; the presence of this inflammable body in animals is evident,\r\nand it is also proved that it is liable to ignite. Morton saw flames\r\ncoming from the body of a pig. Bonami and Ruysh, with a lighted candle,\r\nset fire to the vapour arising from the stomach of a woman whom they were\r\nopening. In the Memoirs of the Academy of Science of Paris, of 1751, we\r\nfind the case of a butcher, who, on opening the body of an ox that had\r\ndied after a malady which had swollen him considerably, was severely burnt\r\nby an explosion and a flame which rose to the height of about five feet.\r\nSturm, Bartholini, and Gaubius record fiery eructations in which, no\r\ndoubt, phosphurated hydrogen had been generated in the stomach, from some\r\ncombination of alcohol and animal substances, and inflamed upon coming\r\ninto contact with atmospheric air; the fetid odour which invariably\r\naccompanies these combustions appears to warrant the conclusion. Fodere\r\nremarks that hydrogen gas is developed in certain cases of disease even\r\nin the living body, and he agrees with Mere in attributing spontaneous\r\ncombustion to the united action of hydrogen and electricity. The case of a\r\nBohemian peasant is narrated, who lost his life in consequence of ignited\r\ninflammable air issuing from his mouth which could not be extinguished. It\r\nseems evident that this accident only occurs under certain conditions of\r\nthe body; generally in aged persons upwards of sixty years old; more\r\nfrequently in women than in men, and chiefly when of indolent habits, a\r\ndebilitated frame, and intemperate in their mode of living. That the body\r\nhas been usually consumed long before the head and the extremities is\r\nevident, since these parts have been more commonly found than the trunk.\r\nIt also has been ascertained by observation that this strange accident\r\nseldom occurs in summer, but principally during severe cold and frosty\r\nweather. It appears that some experiments have been recently made in the\r\nUnited States, when the blood flowing from the arm of a man addicted to\r\nspirituous liquors actually took fire, being placed in contact with a\r\nlighted taper!\r\n\r\nMedical observers differ in opinion on this singular yet\r\nwell-authenticated phenomenon. Lair, Vicy d'Argou, and Dupuytren maintain\r\nthat to produce it, the contact of fire is necessary. Le Cat and Kopp, on\r\nthe contrary, affirm that this combustion may be spontaneous without the\r\nintervention of any external agent, and resulting from some peculiar\r\npredisposition. According to Le Cat animals contain inflammable substances\r\nwhich ignite of themselves. De Castro relates the cases of several\r\nindividuals from whom friction could draw sparks. Daniel Horstius mentions\r\na gouty patient, from whose limbs, on being rubbed, vivid sparks arose.\r\nThese physicians consider that these electric sparks are sufficient to\r\nignite the spirituous liquor which may have saturated any organic tissue\r\nof the body, the combustion being afterwards fed by animal oil.\r\n\r\nThis theory is, however, subject to many objections. It is difficult to\r\nimagine that any substance introduced into the organ of digestion should\r\nretain its former principles of inflammability. Although Cuvier and\r\nDumeril relate, that in opening the body of a man who died from excess of\r\ndrinking, the effluvia of the liquor arose from every cavity.\r\n\r\nOn this subject, fraught with much interest, nothing positive has been\r\nascertained, despite the late progress of chemical investigation. This\r\ncombustion indeed differs widely from all other burning; sometimes a\r\nflickering and bluish flame arises; at other times a smothered heat or\r\nfire, without visible flames, is the consuming agent. Water increases the\r\ncombustion instead of allaying it. It is moreover a well-known fact, that\r\na considerable quantity of fuel is required to consume a dead body,\r\nwhereas in this combustion, incineration is most rapid. The human body,\r\nindeed, is not easily consumed; a case is related of a baker-boy, named\r\nRenaud, who was sentenced to be burnt at Caen; two large cart-loads of\r\nfagots were required to consume the body, and at the end of more than ten\r\nhours, some remains were still visible.\r\n\r\nThe extreme incombustibility of the body was singularly exemplified in the\r\ncase of Mrs. King, whose murderer was engaged for several weeks in\r\nendeavouring to burn her remains without effecting his purpose.\r\n\r\nIt has also been affirmed by various medical observers, that the human\r\nbody will occasionally secrete an inflammable matter emitted by\r\nperspiration. Thus, it is stated, that the perspiration of the wife of a\r\nphysician of the Archbishop of Toledo was of such a combustible nature,\r\nthat a ribbon which she had worn, being exposed to the air, took fire.\r\nBorelli relates the case of a peasant, whose linen would ignite in a\r\nsimilar manner, whether it was laid up in a chest or hung up to dry.\r\nAmongst the many curious stories of the kind, we quote De Castro, who\r\naffirms that he knew a physician, from whose back-bone fire issued so\r\nvividly as to dazzle the eyes of the beholders. Krautius informs us, that\r\ncertain people of the territory of Nivers (?) were burning with an\r\ninvisible fire, and that some of them lopped off a foot or a hand to cut\r\noff the conflagration!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRASSICA ERUCA, OR THE ROCKET PLANT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plant, now in total disuse, was considered by the ancients as a most\r\npowerful aphrodisiac, and consecrated to Venus. Hence Martial and Ovid--\r\n\r\n  Et Venerem revocans eruca morantem.\r\n    *       *       *       *       *\r\n  Nec minus erucas jubeo vitare salaces.\r\n\r\nBut the most curious document regarding this obnoxious weed is found in\r\nLobel, who states that it was carefully cultivated in the gardens of\r\nmonasteries and nunneries, to preserve their chastity.\r\n\r\n\"Haec eruca, major Hispanica, vel quia in condimentis lautior, vel ad\r\nvenerem vegetior erat, gentilis vulgo vocata fuit; quo vocabulo Hispanica\r\net Itala gens designat quamlibet rem aptam reddere hominem laetum et\r\nexperrectum ad munia vulgo pausibilia, ut joca ludicra et venerem; quae\r\ncommoda ut ex ea perciperet monachorum saginata caterva, in perquam\r\namoena Magalonae, insula maris Narbonensis, hujus gentilis erucae semine a\r\nfratre quodam Hispano ambulone donato, quotannis hocce serebat, et in\r\nmensis cuilibet, vel maximo gulae irritamento, vel blandimento, praeferebat;\r\nnimirum usu gnara quantum frequens esus conferret ad calorem venereum in\r\nillis otio et frequenti crapula obrutum, ad vigorem animi excitandum, et\r\npraesertim corpus obesum extenuandum, somnumque excutiendum, quo illi\r\nveluti ursi gliresve tota hyeme saginati, ferme adipe suffocabantur. Verum\r\nisto Hispanico remedio adeo hilarescebant et gentiles fiebant, ut\r\nplerumque recinctis lumbis castitate, coacti essent vota et coenobii\r\nmoenia transilire, et aliquid solatii venerei ab vicinis plebanis\r\nefflagitare. Nobis haec visa et risa. Eruca vero inibi superstes est\r\ncopiosissima, monumentum futura monasticae castitatis et rei\r\nveritatis.\"--_Adv. p. 68._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAGLIOSTRO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first appellation the Grecians gave to those who exercised the art of\r\nhealing was _iatros_. Originally it merely signified a man possessed of\r\nthe power of relieving accidents, either by manual exertions, or the\r\nhidden virtues of some amulet or charm. Sextus tells us that in ancient\r\ntimes it applied to an extractor of arrows, _sagittarum extractor_. No\r\ndoubt, this operation constituted the chief business of the surgeon in the\r\ninfancy of the art; and warriors and heroes themselves performed it on the\r\nfield of battle, as fully exemplified in Homer.\r\n\r\nThe primitive title of _iatros_ gradually descended to surgical\r\npractitioners. We find that Nebrus and Heraclides were the chief _iaters_\r\nof Cos, the birthplace of Hippocrates. To this day the same name is given\r\nto medical men in Greece, where, until lately, they were in the habit of\r\nperambulating the streets, and seeking occupation by crying out at certain\r\ndistances, _Callos iatros!_ (The good doctor!) Balsamo, a celebrated\r\nmountebank, being at Cairo, where he died, one of his disciples repaired\r\nto Europe, and, anxious to bear a singular name, assumed this cry, and\r\ncalled himself _Calloiatro_, or, according to the corrupt pronunciation,\r\n_Cagliostro_: his history is well known, and he certainly excelled in\r\nimpudence and industry all his predecessors. These Greek _iaters_, when\r\ngoing over to Italy to practise, called themselves _medici_, which Cato\r\nwanted to change into _mendici_, for, said he, \"These creatures, (_Illi\r\nGraeculi_,) quit their native country, where they were starving, to seek\r\ntheir fortune in Rome (_ut fortunam sibi mendicent_).\" Under this austere\r\ncensor few of these emigrants dared to settle in the Roman territories,\r\nbut after his demise they inundated the country to such an extent, that it\r\nwas said that Rome had more physicians than patients who needed their\r\nattendance. This influx of practitioners occasioned constant competition,\r\nand each _iater_ endeavoured to obtain fame and emolument by underrating\r\nhis opponents, and endeavouring to introduce novel doctrines, seeking a\r\nlivelihood, as Pliny observed, _inter mortes et mendacia_. It was on these\r\nadventurers that the following epigram was written:\r\n\r\n  Fingunt se cuncti medicos,--idiota, sacerdos,\r\n  Judaeus, monachus, histrio, rasor, anus.\r\n\r\nThe quackery of these candidates for popularity became the subject of\r\nbitter satire; and Martial thus speaks of the _Iatre_ Symmachus:\r\n\r\n  Languebam, sed tu comitatus protinus ad me\r\n  Venisti centum, Symmache, discipulis;\r\n  Centum me tetigere manus, aquilone gelatae,\r\n  Non habui febrem, Symmache; nunc habeo.[7]\r\n\r\nThis Symmachus, it appears, invariably moved abroad surrounded by hundreds\r\nof his disciples, whose cold investigating hands produced upon their\r\npatients the effects to which Martial alludes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLUNAR INFLUENCE ON HUMAN LIFE AND DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancients, who were chiefly guided in their medical notions by the\r\nsimple operations of nature, attached great importance to the influence of\r\nthe moon. As the stars directed their navigators, so did the planets in\r\nsome degree regulate their other calculations. Finding that the state of\r\nthe weather materially acted on our organism whether in health or in\r\nsickness, they attributed this influence to the appearance of the moon,\r\nwhich generally foretold the vicissitudes in the atmospheric constitution.\r\nThus Hippocrates advises his son Thessalus to study numbers and geometry,\r\nas the knowledge of astronomy was indispensable to a physician, the\r\nphenomena of diseases being dependent on the rising or the setting of the\r\nstars. Aristotle informs his disciples that the bodies of animals are cold\r\nin the decrease of the moon, that blood and humours are then put into\r\nmotion, and to these revolutions he ascribes various derangements of\r\nwomen. To enter into these medical opinions would be foreign to the\r\npresent purpose, but the notions of the ancients regarding lunar influence\r\nin other matters are curious.\r\n\r\nLucilius, the Roman satirist, says that oysters and echini fatten during\r\nlunar augmentation; which also, according to Gellius, enlarges the eyes of\r\ncats: but that onions throw out their buds in the decrease of the moon,\r\nand wither in her increase, an unnatural vegetation, which induced the\r\npeople of Pelusium to avoid their use. Horace also notices the superiority\r\nof shell-fish in the increase.\r\n\r\nPliny not only recognises this influence on shell-fish, but observes, that\r\nthe streaks on the livers of rats answer to the days of the moon's age;\r\nand that ants never work at the time of any change: he also informs us\r\nthat the fourth day of the moon determines the prevalent wind of the\r\nmonth, and confirms the opinion of Aristotle that earthquakes generally\r\nhappen about the new moon. The same philosopher maintains that the moon\r\ncorrupts all slain carcasses she shines upon; occasions drowsiness and\r\nstupor when one sleeps under her beams, which thaw ice and enlarge all\r\nthings; he further contends, that the moon is nourished by rivers, as the\r\nsun is fed by the sea. Galen asserts that all animals that are born when\r\nthe moon is falciform, or at the half-quarter, are weak, feeble, and\r\nshortlived; whereas those that are dropped in the full moon are healthy\r\nand vigorous.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times the same wonderful phenomena have been attributed to\r\nthis planet. The celebrated Ambroise Pare observed, that people were more\r\nsubject to the plague at the full. Lord Bacon partook of the notions of\r\nthe ancients, and he tells us that the moon draws forth heat, induces\r\nputrefaction, increases moisture, and excites the motion of the spirits;\r\nand, what was singular, this great man invariably fell into a syncope\r\nduring a lunar eclipse.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont affirms, that a wound inflicted by moonlight is most difficult\r\nto heal; and he further says, that if a frog be washed clean, and tied to\r\na stake under the rays of the moon in a cold winter night, on the\r\nfollowing morning the body will be found dissolved into a gelatinous\r\nsubstance bearing the shape of the reptile, and that coldness alone\r\nwithout the lunar action will never produce the same effect. Ballonius,\r\nDiemerbroeck, Ramazzini, and numerous celebrated physicians, bear ample\r\ntestimony to its baneful influence in pestilential diseases. The change\r\nobserved in the disease of the horse called moon-blindness is universally\r\nknown and admitted.\r\n\r\nMany modern physicians have stated the opinions of the ancients as regards\r\nlunar influence in diseases, but none have pushed their inquiries with\r\nsuch indefatigable zeal as the late Dr. Mosely; he affirms that almost\r\nall people in extreme age die at the new or at the full moon, and this he\r\nendeavours to prove by the following records:\r\n\r\n  Thomas Parr died at the age of 152, two days after the full moon.\r\n  Henry Jenkins died at the age of 169, the day of the new moon.\r\n  Elizabeth Steward, 124, the day of the new moon.\r\n  William Leland, 140, the day after the new moon.\r\n  John Effingham, 144, two days after full moon.\r\n  Elizabeth Hilton, 121, two days after the full moon.\r\n  John Constant, 113, two days after the new moon.\r\n\r\nThe doctor then proceeds to show, by the deaths of various illustrious\r\npersons, that a similar rule holds good with the generality of mankind:\r\n\r\n  Chaucer, 25th October 1400, the day of the first quarter.\r\n  Copernicus, 24th May 1543, day of the last quarter.\r\n  Luther, 18th February 1546, three days after the full.\r\n  Henry VIII, 28th January 1547, the day of the first quarter.\r\n  Calvin, 27th May 1564, two days after the full.\r\n  Cornaro, 26th April 1566, day of the first quarter.\r\n  Queen Elizabeth, 24th March 1603, day of the last quarter.\r\n  Shakspeare, 23rd April 1616, day after the full.\r\n  Camden, 9th November 1623, day before the new moon.\r\n  Bacon, 9th April 1626, one day after last quarter.\r\n  Vandyke, 9th April 1641, two days after full moon.\r\n  Cardinal Richelieu, 4th December 1642, three days before full moon.\r\n  Doctor Harvey, 30th June 1657, a few hours before the new moon.\r\n  Oliver Cromwell, 3rd September 1658, two days after full moon.\r\n  Milton, 15th November 1674, two days before the new moon.\r\n  Sydenham, 29th December 1689, two days before the full moon.\r\n  Locke, 28th November 1704, two days before the full moon.\r\n  Queen Anne, 1st August 1714, two days after the full moon.\r\n  Louis XIV, 1st September 1715, a few hours before the full moon.\r\n  Marlborough, 16th June 1722, two days before the full moon.\r\n  Newton, 20th March 1726, two days before the new moon.\r\n  George I, 11th June 1727, three days after new moon.\r\n  George II, 25th October 1760, one day after full moon.\r\n  Sterne, 13th September 1768, two days after new moon.\r\n  Whitfield, 18th September 1770, a few hours before the new moon.\r\n  Swedenburg, 19th March 1772, the day of the full moon.\r\n  Linnaeus, 10th January 1778, two days before the full moon.\r\n  The Earl of Chatham, 11th May 1778, the day of the full moon.\r\n  Rousseau, 2nd July 1778, the day after the first quarter.\r\n  Garrick, 20th January 1779, three days after the new moon.\r\n  Dr. Johnson, 14th December 1784, two days after the new moon.\r\n  Dr. Franklin, 17th April 1790, three days after the new moon.\r\n  Sir Joshua Reynolds, 23rd February 1792, the day after the new moon.\r\n  Lord Guildford, 5th August 1722, three days after the full moon.\r\n  Dr. Warren, 23rd June 1797, a day before the new moon.\r\n  Burke, 9th July 1797, at the instant of the full moon.\r\n  Macklin, 11th July 1797, two days after full moon.\r\n  Wilkes, 26th December 1797, the day of the first quarter.\r\n  Washington, 15th December 1799, three days after full moon.\r\n  Sir W. Hamilton, 6th April 1803, a few hours before the full moon.\r\n\r\nThe doctor winds up this extract from the bills of mortality by the\r\nfollowing appropriate remark: \"Here we see the moon, as she shines on all\r\nalike, so she makes no distinction of persons in her influence:\r\n\r\n  \"------aequo pulsat pede pauperum tabernas,\r\n  Regumque turres.\"\r\n                                HOR. Lib. i. Od. 4.\r\n\r\nNot only did the ancients consider the animal creation as constantly under\r\nplanetary influence, but all vegetable productions and medicinal\r\nsubstances were subject to its laws. The Druids of Gaul and Britain\r\ngathered the famed misletoe with a golden knife when the moon was six days\r\nold. The vervain, held in such high repute by the Romans, was gathered,\r\nafter libations of honey and wine, at the rising of the dog-star, and with\r\nthe left hand, and thus collected served, for various sacerdotal and\r\nmedical purposes: its branches were employed to sweep the temples of\r\nJupiter; it was used in exorcisms for sprinkling lustral water; and\r\nmoreover it cured fevers, the bite of venomous reptiles, and appeased\r\ndiscord; hence it was borne by those heralds who were sent to sue for\r\npeace, and called _verbenarii_; and when its benign powers were shed over\r\nthe festive board, mirth and good temper were sure to prevail. So\r\ngenerally and so highly appreciated was this all-powerful plant, that\r\nPliny tells us,\r\n\r\n  Nulla herba Romanae nobilitatis plus habet quam hierabotane.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is somewhat doubtful whether the vervain of the ancients was\r\nsimilar to the plant which now bears that name. It would appear that\r\nformerly the appellation of _verbenae_ or _sagmina_ was given to various\r\nplants employed in religious ceremonies: and branches of pine-tree, of\r\nlaurel, and of myrtle were sometimes thus denominated. Virgil says in his\r\nEclogues,\r\n\r\n  Verbenasque adole pingues, et mascula thura.\r\n\r\nNow the epithets of _pingues_ and _thura_ cannot apply to our vervain, but\r\nto some resinous production.\r\n\r\nMedicine at that period might have been called an astronomic science;\r\nevery medicinal substance was under a specific influence, and to this day\r\nthe R which precedes prescriptions, and is admitted to represent the first\r\nletter of _recipe_, was in fact the symbol of Jupiter, under whose\r\nspecial protection medicines were exhibited. Every part of the body was\r\nthen considered under the influence of the zodiacal constellations, and\r\nManilius gives us the following description of their powers:\r\n\r\n  Namque Aries capiti, Taurus cervicibus haeret;\r\n  Brachia sub Geminis censentur, pectora Cancro;\r\n  Te, scapulae, Nemaee, vocant, teque ilia, Virgo;\r\n  Libra colit clunes, et Scorpius inguine regnat;\r\n  Et femur Arcitenens, genua et Capricornus amavit;\r\n  Cruraque defendit Juvenis, vestigia, Pisces.\r\n                                _Astronomicon_, lib. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECTACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of these valuable instruments is uncertain: that the ancients\r\nwere acquainted with the laws of refraction is beyond all doubt, since\r\nthey made use of glass globes filled with water to produce combustion; and\r\nin Seneca we find the following very curious passage--\"Litterae, quamvis\r\nminutiae et obscurae, per vitream pilam aqua plenam majores clarioresque\r\ncernuntur;\" yet thirteen centuries elapsed ere spectacles were known. It\r\nis supposed that they were first invented by _Salvino_ or _Salvinio\r\nArmati_; but he kept his discovery secret, until Alessandro de Spina, a\r\nmonk in Pisa, brought them into use in 1313. Salvino was considered their\r\ninventor, from the epitaph on his tomb in the cathedral church in\r\nFlorence: \"Qui giace Salvino d'Armato, degl' Armati di Firenze, inventor\r\ndelli occhiali, &c., 1317.\" Another circumstance seems to add weight to\r\nthis presumption: _Luigi Sigoli_, a contemporary artist, in a painting of\r\nthe Circumcision, represents the high-priest Simeon with a pair of\r\nspectacles, which, from his advanced age, it was supposed he might have\r\nneeded on the occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEECHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of their introduction in the practice of medicine is uncertain.\r\nThey were well known to the ancients under the name of _hirudo_. Thus\r\nHorace:\r\n\r\n  Non missura cutem nisi plena cruoris hirudo.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks called them [Greek: Boella], and Pliny states that elephants\r\nwere often cruelly tormented by them when they swallowed any of these\r\nworms in their water: \"Cruciatum in potu maximum sentiunt hausta hirudine,\r\nquam sanguisugam vulgo coepisse appellari adverto.\"\r\n\r\nLeeches are oviparous, and their ova are discharged in one involucre near\r\nthe surface and margin of pools, and are hatched by the heat of the sun.\r\nThey do not cast their skin, as is generally supposed, but merely throw\r\noff a tough slimy membrane, which appears to be produced by disease, and\r\nfrom which they get disencumbered by straining themselves through grass\r\nand rushes. During winter they remain in a torpid state. They are most\r\ntenacious of life; some say they can live for several days in the\r\nexhausted receiver of the air-pump, and in other media destructive of\r\nother animals. This phenomenon is attributed to the slow oxygenation of\r\nthe blood in the respiratory vesicles.\r\n\r\nIn regard to their food we are ignorant, although Dr. Johnson says that\r\nthey live by sucking the blood of fish and reptiles.\r\n\r\nThe collection of leeches constitutes a lucrative trade on the Continent,\r\nbut more particularly in France, where it is called a leech-fishery, and\r\nwhere, in Paris alone, three millions are annually consumed. The following\r\nis an interesting description of the miserable people engaged in this\r\noccupation from the _Gazette des Hopitaux_.\r\n\r\n\"If ever you pass through La Brenne, you will see a man, pale and\r\nstraight-haired, with a woollen cap on his head, and his legs and arms\r\nnaked; he walks along the borders of a marsh, among the spots left dry by\r\nthe surrounding waters. This man is a leech-fisher. To see him from a\r\ndistance,--his wobegone aspect, his hollow eyes, his livid lips, his\r\nsingular gestures, you would take him for a maniac. If you observe him\r\nevery now and then raising his legs and examining them one after another,\r\nyou might suppose him a fool; but he is an intelligent leech-fisher. The\r\nleeches attach themselves to his legs and feet as he moves among their\r\nhaunts; he feels their bite, and gathers them as they cluster about the\r\nroots of the bulrushes and aquatic weeds, or beneath the stones covered\r\nwith a green and slimy moss. He may thus collect ten or twelve dozen in\r\nthree or four hours. In summer, when the leeches retire into deep water,\r\nthe fishers move about upon rafts made of twigs and rushes. One of these\r\ntraders was known to collect, with the aid of his children, seventeen\r\nthousand five hundred leeches in the course of a few months; these he had\r\ndeposited in a reservoir, where, in night, they were all frozen _en\r\nmasse_.\" But congelation does not kill them, and they can easily be thawed\r\ninto life, by melting the ice that surrounds them. Leeches, it appears,\r\ncan bear much rougher usage than one might imagine: they are packed up\r\nclosely in wet bags, carried on pack-saddles, and it is well known that\r\nthey will attach themselves with more avidity when rubbed in a dry napkin\r\nprevious to their application. Leech-gatherers are in general short-lived,\r\nand become early victims to agues, and other diseases brought on by the\r\ndamp and noxious air that constantly surrounds them; the effects of which\r\nthey seek to counteract by the use of strong liquors.\r\n\r\nLeeches kept in a glass bottle may serve as a barometer, as they\r\ninvariably ascend or descend in the water as the weather changes from dry\r\nto wet, and they generally rise to the surface prior to a thunder-storm.\r\nThey are most voracious, and are frequently observed to destroy one\r\nanother by suction; the strong ones attaching themselves to the weaker.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of blood drawn by leeches has been a subject of much\r\ncontroversy; but it is pretty nearly ascertained that a healthy leech,\r\nwhen fully gorged, has extracted about half an ounce. When they will not\r\nreadily fix, Dr. Johnson recommends that they be put into a cup of porter.\r\nThe cause of a leech falling off when full is not clearly ascertained, but\r\nit is supposed to arise from a state of asphyxia brought on by the\r\ncompression of the breathing vesicles, and the distension of the\r\nalimentary tube.\r\n\r\nMany serious accidents have arisen from leeches being swallowed in the\r\nwater of swamps and marshes, too frequently drunk with avidity by the\r\nthirsty and exhausted soldier. Larrey mentions several cases of the kind\r\nduring the French campaign in Egypt, and two fatal instances fell under my\r\nobservation during the Peninsular war; draughts of salt water, vinegar,\r\nand various stimulating injections could not loosen their hold, and they\r\nwere too deeply attached in the throat to be seized with a forceps.\r\nZacutus Lusitanus had witnessed the same unfortunate results. The leech\r\nthus swallowed is generally the _hirudo Alpina_.\r\n\r\nNorfolk supplies the greater part of the leeches brought to London, but\r\nthey are also found in Kent, Suffolk, Essex, and Wales. The leeches\r\nimported from France differ from ours, in having the belly of one uniform\r\ncolour. The best are the green, with yellow stripes along the body. The\r\nhorse-leech, which is used in the north of Europe, but also common in\r\nEngland, is entirely brown, or only marked with a marginal yellow line. A\r\npopular belief prevails, that the application of this variety is most\r\ndangerous, as they are said to suck out all the blood in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMNAMBULISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis singular aberration from our natural habits may be considered an\r\nintermediate state between sleeping and being awake. This infraction of\r\nphysiologic laws may therefore be looked upon as a morbid condition.\r\nPhysicians have given it various denominations, founded on its phenomena,\r\n_nocti-vagatio_, _nocti-surgium_, _noct-ambulatio_, _somnus vigilans_,\r\n_vigilia somnans_. Somnambulism was well known by the ancients; and\r\nAristotle tells us, \"there are individuals who rise in their sleep, and\r\nwalk about seeing as clearly as those that are awake.\"\r\n\r\nDiogenes Laertius states that Theon the philosopher, was a sleep-walker.\r\nGalen slept whilst on a road, and pursued his journey until he was\r\nawakened by tripping on a stone. Felix Plater fell asleep while playing on\r\nthe lute, and was only startled from his slumbers by the fall of the\r\ninstrument. There is no doubt but that in somnambulists the intellectual\r\nfunctions are not only active, but frequently more developed than when the\r\nindividual is awake. Persons in this state have been known to write and\r\ncorrect verses, and solve difficult problems, which they could not have\r\ndone at other times. In their actions and locomotion they are more\r\ncautious, and frequently more dexterous, than when awake. They have been\r\nknown to saddle and bridle horses, after having dressed themselves; put on\r\nboots and spurs, and afterwards ride considerable distances from home and\r\nback again. A sleep-walker wandering abroad in winter complained of being\r\nfrozen, and asked for a glass of brandy, but expressed violent anger on\r\nbeing offered a glass of water. The celebrated sect of _Tremblers_, in the\r\nCevennes mountains, used to rove about in their sleep, and, although badly\r\nacquainted with the French language, expressed themselves clearly and put\r\nup prayers in that tongue, instead of the Latin _Pater_ and _Credo_ which\r\nthey had been taught. A singular phenomenon in some cases of this\r\naffection is that of walking about without groping, whether the eyelids\r\nare closed or open. Somnambulism has been known to be hereditary: Horstius\r\nmentions three brothers who were affected with it at the same period;\r\nWillis knew a whole family subject to it. It is not generally known that\r\nthe subject of the French dramatic piece called \"La Somnambule\" was\r\nfounded on fact.\r\n\r\nSingular faculties have been developed in the mental condition. Thus a\r\ncase is related of a woman in the Edinburgh infirmary, who during her\r\nparoxysm not only mimicked the manner of the attendant physicians, but\r\nrepeated correctly some of their prescriptions in Latin.\r\n\r\nDr. Dyce, of Aberdeen, describes the case of a girl, in which this\r\naffection began with fits of somnolency, which came upon her suddenly\r\nduring the day, and from which she could at first be roused by shaking or\r\nby being taken into the open air. During these attacks she was in the\r\nhabit of talking of things that seemed to pass before her like a dream,\r\nand was not at the time sensible of any thing that was said to her. On one\r\noccasion she repeated the entire of the baptismal service of the Church of\r\nEngland, and concluded with an extemporary prayer. In her subsequent\r\nparoxysms she began to understand what was said to her, and to answer with\r\na considerable degree of consistency, though these replies were in a\r\ncertain measure influenced by her hallucination. She also became capable\r\nof following her usual employment during the paroxysm. At one time she\r\nwould lay out the table for breakfast, and repeatedly dress herself and\r\nthe children, her eyes remaining shut the whole time. The remarkable\r\ncircumstance was now discovered, that, during the paroxysm, she had a\r\ndistinct recollection of what had taken place in former attacks, though\r\nshe had not the slightest recollection of it during the intervals. She was\r\ntaken to church during the paroxysm, and attended the service with\r\napparent devotion, and at one time was so affected by the sermon that she\r\nactually shed tears; yet in the interval she had no recollection whatever\r\nof the circumstance, but in the following paroxysm she gave a most\r\ndistinct account of it, and actually repeated the passage of the sermon\r\nthat had so much affected her. This sort of somnambulism, relating\r\ndistinctly to two periods, has been called, perhaps erroneously, a _state\r\nof double consciousness_.\r\n\r\nThis girl described the paroxysm as coming on with a dimness of sight and\r\na noise in the head. During the attack, her eyelids were generally half\r\nshut, and frequently resembled those of a person labouring under\r\namaurosis, the pupil dilated and insensible. Her looks were dull and\r\nvacant, and she often mistook the person who was speaking to her. The\r\nparoxysms usually lasted an hour, but she often could be roused from them.\r\nShe then yawned and stretched herself like a person awakening from sleep,\r\nand instantly recognised those about her. At one time Dr. Dyce affirms,\r\nshe read distinctly a portion of a book presented to her, and she would\r\nfrequently sing pieces of music more correctly and with better taste than\r\nwhen awake.\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the phenomena of the preceding case, Dr. Abercrombie\r\ngives the following very curious history: \"A girl, aged seven years, an\r\norphan of the lowest rank, residing in the house of a farmer, by whom she\r\nwas employed in tending cattle, was accustomed to sleep in an apartment\r\nseparated by a very thin partition from one which was frequently occupied\r\nby an itinerant fiddler. This person was a musician of very considerable\r\nskill, and often spent a part of the night in performing pieces of a\r\nrefined description; but his performance was not taken notice of by the\r\nchild, except as a disagreeable noise. After a residence of six months in\r\nthis family she fell into bad health, and was removed to the house of a\r\nbenevolent lady, where, on her recovery after a protracted illness, she\r\nwas employed as a servant. Some years after she came to reside with this\r\nlady, the most beautiful music was often heard in the house during the\r\nnight, which excited no small interest and wonder in the family; and many\r\na waking hour was spent in endeavours to discover the invisible minstrel.\r\nAt length the sound was traced to the sleeping-room of the girl, who was\r\nfound fast asleep, but uttering from her lips a sound exactly resembling\r\nthe sweetest tones of a small violin. On further observation it was found,\r\nthat after being about two hours in bed, she became restless and began to\r\nmutter to herself; she then uttered sounds precisely resembling the tuning\r\nof a violin, and at length, after some prelude, dashed off into an\r\nelaborate piece of music, which she performed in a clear and accurate\r\nmanner, and with a sound exactly resembling the most delicate modulation\r\nof the instrument, and then began exactly where she had stopped in the\r\nmost correct manner. These paroxysms occurred at irregular intervals,\r\nvarying from one to fourteen and even twenty nights; and they were\r\ngenerally followed by a degree of fever and pain over various parts of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\n\"After a year or two, her music was not confined to the imitation of the\r\nviolin, but was often exchanged for that of a piano, of a very old\r\ndescription, which she was accustomed to hear in the house in which she\r\nnow lived, and then she would begin to sing, imitating exactly the voices\r\nof several ladies of the family.\r\n\r\n\"In another year from this time she began to talk a great deal in her\r\nsleep, in which she fancied herself instructing a young companion. She\r\noften descanted with the utmost fluency and correctness on a variety of\r\nsubjects, both political and religious, the men of the day, the historical\r\nparts of Scripture, public characters, and particularly the character of\r\nthe members of the family and their visiters. In these discussions she\r\nshowed the most wonderful discrimination, often combined with sarcasm, and\r\nastonishing powers of mimickry. Her language through the whole was fluent\r\nand correct, and her illustrations often forcible and even eloquent. She\r\nwas fond of illustrating her subjects by what she called _a fable_, and in\r\nthese, her imagery was both appropriate and correct. The justice and truth\r\nof her remarks on all subjects, excited the utmost astonishment in those\r\nwho were acquainted with her limited means of acquiring information.\r\n\r\n\"She had been known to conjugate correctly Latin verbs, which she had\r\nprobably heard in the school room of the family, and she was once heard to\r\nspeak several sentences very correctly in French, at the same time stating\r\nthat she had heard them from a foreign gentleman whom she had met\r\naccidentally in a shop. Being questioned on this subject when awake, she\r\nremembered having seen the gentleman, but could not repeat a word of what\r\nhe had said.\r\n\r\n\"During her paroxysms it was almost impossible to awake her, and when her\r\neyelids were raised and a candle brought near the eye, the pupil seemed\r\ninsensible to the light. For several years she was, during the paroxysm,\r\nentirely unconscious of the presence of other persons, but about the age\r\nof sixteen, she began to observe those who were in the apartment, and she\r\ncould tell correctly their number though the utmost care was taken to have\r\nthe room darkened. She now also became capable of answering questions that\r\nwere put to her, and of noticing remarks made in her presence, and, with\r\nregard to both, she showed astonishing acuteness. Her observations indeed\r\nwere often of such a nature, and corresponded so accurately with character\r\nand events, that, by the country people, she was believed to be endowed\r\nwith supernatural power.\r\n\r\n\"During the whole period of this remarkable affection, which seems to have\r\ngone on for at least ten or eleven years, she was, when awake, a dull\r\nawkward girl, very slow in receiving any kind of instruction, though much\r\ncare was bestowed upon her; and in point of intellect, she was much\r\ninferior to the other servants of the family. In particular, she showed no\r\nkind of turn for music. She did not appear to have any recollection of\r\nwhat passed in her sleep; but during her nocturnal ramblings, she was more\r\nthan once heard to lament her infirmity of speaking in her sleep, adding\r\nhow fortunate it was she did not sleep among the other servants, as they\r\nteased her enough about it as it was.\r\n\r\n\"About the age of twenty-one she became immoral in her conduct, and was\r\ndismissed the family. Her propensity to talk in her sleep continued to the\r\ntime of her dismissal, but a great change had taken place in her nocturnal\r\nconversation. It had gradually lost its acuteness and brilliancy, and\r\nlatterly became the mere babbling of a vulgar mind, often mingled with\r\ninsolent remarks against her superiors, and the most profane scoffing at\r\nmorality and religion. It is believed that she afterwards became insane.\"\r\n\r\nTo what serious reflections does not this curious history give rise. Here\r\nthere did unquestionably exist a double existence. The one a relative\r\nbeing surrounded with the realities of life; the other a natural\r\ncondition, unshackled by constraint, and left entirely to the wild\r\nenjoyment of a luxuriant fancy and an apprehension quick and brilliant. In\r\nthe former, the young creature found herself derided and degraded by her\r\nvulgar companions; her generous infirmities, if such they may be called,\r\nmade the subject of low ribaldy. In her second existence, she became the\r\nfree child of nature.\r\n\r\nMight not proper care have saved this interesting creature from misery!\r\nIt is admitted that \"much care had been bestowed upon her instruction,\"\r\nbut was she withdrawn from the low circle that surrounded her and placed\r\nin a society where, in her waking hours, she could have derived those\r\nadvantages of a superior intercourse, which might have worked upon her\r\nvivid imagination as powerfully as the melodious sounds she had heard at\r\nother times? \"She became immoral--scoffed at religion\"--_in her sleep_.\r\nShe was then in a state of nature; unconscious, to a certain extent, of\r\nimmorality and religion, although conscious, no doubt, of relative good\r\nand evil. Is it not more than probable that when awake, not only were her\r\nears assailed by profane and improper language, but is it not most likely\r\nthat her ruin was perpetrated during her visionary slumbers, and ever\r\nafter visited her mind during her paroxysms? Nor is it improbable that her\r\naffections had been bestowed upon her despoiler. Instead of being\r\ndismissed and cast upon the wide world, helpless, stigmatized, perhaps,\r\nwith the odious epithet of witch--for we have seen that the lower order\r\nconsidered her such--might not a friendly hand have secured her in an\r\nabode where she might have been invited _to_ COME _and sin no more_! Alas!\r\nno wonder that the poor creature should have become insane! It is said\r\nthat she was obtuse in intellect when awake. May not this be accounted for\r\nin some measure, by the exhaustion of her mental faculties during her\r\nparoxysms? It is to be lamented that the learned and philosophic Dr.\r\nAbercrombie, who has given this history, did not comment upon it. True\r\nChristianity and its benevolence breath in every line of the eloquent\r\nwriter, and the poor Scotch _lassie_ might have afforded him a valuable\r\ntheme. How proud would any humane person have felt in making this\r\ninteresting object of pity what she might have been!\r\n\r\nDr. Dewar also relates the case of an ignorant servant-girl, who, during\r\nthe paroxysm of somnambulism, showed an astonishing knowledge of geography\r\nand astronomy, and expressed herself, in her own language, in a manner\r\nwhich, though often ludicrous, showed an understanding of the subject. The\r\nalteration of the seasons, for example, she explained by saying the world\r\nwas set _a gee_.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of somnambulism the sleeper is able to continue the\r\noccupation that he had previously carried on. Martinet mentions a\r\nwatchmaker's apprentice, whose paroxysm came on once in the fortnight, and\r\ncommenced in a sensation of heat ascending to the heart. This was followed\r\nby a confusion of thought and insensibility. His eyes were open, but\r\nfixed and vacant, and he was totally insensible to every thing around him.\r\nYet he continued his usual employment, and was always much surprised when\r\nhe awoke to find the progress that had taken place in his work. This case\r\nended in epilepsy.\r\n\r\nHorstius, whom we have already quoted, tells us of a noble youth of\r\nBreslau, living in the citadel, who used to steal out of a window during\r\nhis sleep, muffled up in his cloak, and ascend the roof of the building,\r\nwhere one night he tore in pieces a magpie's nest, wrapped up the little\r\nones in his cloak, and returned to bed. The following morning he mentioned\r\nthe circumstance as having occurred in a dream, but could not be persuaded\r\nof the reality of the circumstance till the magpies in the cloak were\r\nshown to him.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie has given a very remarkable case of a young woman of low\r\nrank, who, at the age of 19, became insane, but was gentle, and applied\r\nherself eagerly to various occupations. Before her insanity she had been\r\nonly learning to read and to form a few letters; but during her lunacy she\r\ntaught herself to write perfectly, though all attempts of others had\r\nfailed; she had intervals of reason, which frequently continued three\r\nweeks and sometimes longer. During these she could neither read nor write,\r\nbut immediately on the return of her insanity, she recovered the power of\r\nwriting and reading.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of conversing in a state of somnambulism is too well\r\nauthenticated to be doubted, although in many instances it may have been a\r\nfraudulent trick of animal magnetism. This singular power has been\r\nrecorded by several of the ancient writers, many of whom pretended that\r\ndivine inspiration illumined the sleepers. Cicero tells us that when the\r\nLacedaemonian magistrates were embarrassed in their administration, they\r\nwent to sleep in the temple of Pasiphae, thus named from _Pasi phainein_,\r\nor \"communicative to all.\" Strabo mentions a cavern, sacred to Pluto and\r\nJuno, where the sick came to consult sleeping priests. Aristides is said\r\nto have delivered his opinion while fast asleep in the temple of\r\nAesculapius. It would be endless to quote all the authorities on this\r\nsubject. Modern magnetisers, however, outstrip the ancients in the wonders\r\nthey relate in regard to somnambulent faculties developed by magnetism. In\r\n1829, Cloquet, a very distinguished Parisian surgeon, assisted by Dr.\r\nChapelain, removed the cancerous breast of a lady in her magnetic sleep,\r\nduring which she continued her conversation, unconscious of the operation,\r\nwhich lasted twelve minutes.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of seeing through the closed eyelids was fully substantiated\r\nin the presence of a commission of investigation appointed by the Academy\r\nof Medicine of Paris, and in the presence of fifteen persons. They found a\r\nsomnambulist, of the name of Paul, to all appearance fast asleep. On being\r\nrequested to rise and approach the window, he complied immediately. His\r\neyes were then covered in such a manner as not to awaken him, and a pack\r\nof cards having been shuffled by several persons, he recognised them\r\nwithout the slightest hesitation. Watches were then shown him, and he\r\nnamed the hour and minute, though the hands were repeatedly altered. A\r\nbook was then presented to him,--it happened to be a collection of\r\noperas,--and he read _Cantor et Pollux_ instead of _Castor et Pollux,\r\nTragedie Lyrique_: a volume of Horace was then submitted to him, but not\r\nknowing Latin, he returned it, saying, \"This is some church-book.\" The\r\ncelebrated Dr. Broussais laid before the same somnambulist a letter he had\r\ndrawn from his pocket; to his utter surprise he read the first lines: the\r\ndoctor then wrote a few words on a piece of paper in very small\r\ncharacters, which the somnambulist also read with the utmost facility;\r\nbut, what was still more singular, when letters or books were applied to\r\nhis breast, or between the shoulders, he also perused them with equal\r\naccuracy and ease. In one instance the queen of clubs was presented to his\r\nback; after a moment's hesitation he said, \"This a club--the nine;\" he was\r\ninformed that he was in error, when he recovered himself and said, \"No,\r\n'tis the queen:\" a ten of spades was then applied, when he hastily\r\nexclaimed, \"At any rate this is not a court-card; it is--the ten of\r\nspades.\"\r\n\r\nThe many astute tricks played by animal magnetisers, and frequently\r\ndetected, naturally induced most persons to doubt the veracity of these\r\nexperiments; but when we find that they were witnessed by seventy-eight\r\nmedical men, most of them decidedly hostile to magnetism, and sixty-three\r\nintelligent individuals not belonging to the profession, and in every\r\nrespect disinterested, what are we to say?--perhaps, exclaim with Hamlet,\r\n\r\n  There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,\r\n  Than are dreamt of in your philosophy!\r\n\r\nI cannot better conclude this article than by the following quotation from\r\nDr. Pritchard's valuable work:[8] \"There is an obvious relation between\r\nthe state of the faculties in somnambulism and that which exists during\r\ndreams. It is indeed probable that somnambulism is dreaming in a manner so\r\nmodified, that the will recovers its usual power over muscular motion, and\r\nlikewise becomes endued with a peculiar control over the organs of sense\r\nand perception. This power, which gives rise to the most curious phenomena\r\nof somnambulism, is of such a kind, that, while the senses are in general\r\nobscured, as in sleep, and all other objects are unperceived, the\r\nsomnambulator manifests a faculty of seeing, feeling, or otherwise\r\ndiscovering those particular objects of which he is in pursuit, towards\r\nwhich his attention is by inward movement directed, or with which the\r\ninternal operations of his mind bring him into relation. As in dreams, so\r\nlikewise in somnambulism the individual is intent on the pursuit of\r\nobjects towards which his mind had been previously directed in a powerful\r\nmanner, and his attention strongly roused; he is in both states impelled\r\nby habit, under the influence of which he repeats the routine of his daily\r\nobservances. A somnambulator is a dreamer who is able to act his dreams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL POWERS OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe powerful influence of music on our intellectual faculties, and\r\nconsequently on our health, has long been ascertained, either in raising\r\nthe energies of the mind, or producing despondency and melancholy\r\nassociations of ideas. Impressed with its sublime nature, the ancients\r\ngave it a divine origin. Diodorus tells us that it was a boon bestowed on\r\nmankind after the deluge, and owed its discovery to the sound produced by\r\nthe wind when whistling through the reeds that grew on the banks of the\r\nNile. This science became the early study of philosophers and physicians.\r\nHerophilus explained the alterations of the pulse by the various modes and\r\nrhythms of music. In the sacred writings we have many instances of its\r\ninfluence in producing an aptitude for divine consolation. The derangement\r\nof Saul yielded to the harp of David, and the hand of the Lord came upon\r\nElisha as the minstrel played. In Egypt certain songs were legally\r\nordained in the education of youth, to promote virtue and morality.\r\nPolybius assures us that music was required to soften the manners of the\r\nArcadians, whose climate was heavy and impure; while the inhabitants of\r\nCynaethe, who neglected this science, were the most barbarous in Greece.\r\nThe medical power of harmonious sounds was also fully admitted. We find\r\nPythagoras directing certain mental disorders to be treated by music.\r\nThales, called from Crete to Sparta, cured a disastrous pestilence by its\r\nmeans. Martinus Capella affirms that fevers were thus removed. Xenocrates\r\ncured maniacs by melodious sounds, and Asclepiades conquered deafness with\r\na trumpet. In modern times it has been related of a deaf lady that she\r\ncould only hear while a drum was beating, and a drummer was kept in the\r\nhouse for the purpose of enabling her to converse. Aulus Gellius tells us\r\nthat a case of sciatica was cured by gentle modulations, and Theophrastus\r\nmaintains that the bites of serpents and other venomous reptiles can be\r\nrelieved by similar means. Ancient physicians, who attributed many\r\ndiseases to the influence of evil spirits, fancied that harmonious sounds\r\ndrove them away, more especially when accompanied by incantations; and we\r\nfind in Luther, \"that music is one of the most beautiful and glorious\r\ngifts of God, to which Satan is a bitter enemy.\"\r\n\r\nIn more modern times we have several instances of the medical powers of\r\nmusic, and the effect produced by Farinelli on Philip of Spain is well\r\nknown. This monarch was in such a deplorable state of despondency from ill\r\nhealth, that he refused to be shaved or to appear in public. On the\r\narrival of Farinelli, the Queen was resolved to try the power of music,\r\nand a concert was ordered in a room adjoining the King's chamber:\r\nFarinelli sang two of his best airs,[9] which so overcame Philip that he\r\ndesired he might be brought into his presence, when he promised to grant\r\nhim any reasonable request he might make. The performer, in the most\r\nrespectful manner, then begged of the King to allow himself to be shaved\r\nand attended by his domestics, to which Philip consented. Farinelli\r\ncontinued to sing to him daily until a perfect cure was effected.--The\r\nstory of Tartini is rather curious: in a moment of musical enthusiasm he\r\nfell asleep, when the devil appeared to him playing on the violin, bidding\r\nhim with a horrible grin to play as well as he did; struck with the\r\nvision, the musician awoke, ran to his harpsichord, and produced the\r\nsplendid sonata which he entitled \"_the Devil's_.\" Brueckmann, and Hufeland\r\nrelate cases of St. Vitus's dance, cured by music, which, according to\r\nDesessarts, also relieved Catalepsy. Schneider and Becker have ascertained\r\nits influence in hysteric and hypochondriac affections.\r\n\r\nThe following curious case is recorded by Paret:--\"Une jeune fille\r\nd'environ 11 ans, fort prematuree relativement aux facultes, ayant le\r\ngenre nerveux tres sensible et tres irritable, fut attaquee, il y a\r\nenviron deux ans, de douleurs violentes dans tout le corps, avec insomnie,\r\ntension excessive et fort douleureuse des muscles de l'abdomen,\r\naccompagnee de fievre. Deux ans apres, des convulsions se declarerent,\r\navec une violence qui surpassa tout ce que je craignais; les bonds, les\r\nelans, furent, pendant quatre or cinq jours et autant de nuits, si forts,\r\nqu'il fallait deux hommes pour retenir dans le lit la jeune personne,\r\nd'ailleurs faible et delicate. Enfin, je proposai d'employer la musique.\r\nOn fit, en consequence, entrer deux menestriers, disposes a donner leur\r\npremier coup d'archet; a l'instant de leur apparition les convulsions\r\ncesserent d'abord et-reparurent peu de tems apres: on changea d'air, et\r\nles convulsions cesserent encore pour reparaitre, aussi au troisieme air,\r\nqui sans doute se trouva plus au gout de la malade, elle demanda un\r\nviolon, qu'on lui donna, et quoiqu'elle n'eut jamais fait d'autre essai,\r\nson oeil fixe sur les joueurs, son attention fut si grande, et ses\r\nmouvemens si rapides, qu'elle suivait ceux des menetriers sans causer\r\naucune discordance. Des connaisseurs ne pouvaient s'empecher de convenir\r\nde la justesse et de la precision qu'elle observait. Son oreille etait\r\nmeme si delicate, qu'elle faisait des reproches aux menetriers, qui,\r\nobliges de jouer une grande partie de la nuit, se trouvaient eux-memes\r\ndans le cas de manquer de mesure.\r\n\r\nLa petite malade continua de jouer pendant plus de 30 heures de suite,\r\nsans autre interruption que celle qu'il fallait pour prendre ses\r\nbouillons, et dans ce court intervalle on voyait les contractions des\r\ntendons se renouveller, quoique moins fortes. Les musiciens fatigues, elle\r\nse contenta de la voix, qu'elle accompagna de son instrument. Au bout de\r\nce terme, un sommeil de six ou sept heures, qui vint tres naturellement,\r\nproduisit une augmentation de calme. Au reveil, on varia les exercices, et\r\nainsi se termina la scene qui avait dure 48 heures, apres laquelle les\r\nconvulsions cesserent totalement. Trois jours apres, la malade se trouva\r\nparfaitement bien; et ne restait que des convulsions tres faibles, et la\r\nmaladie se termina apres trois mois de duree.\"\r\n\r\nA still more singular effect of music is related by Roger in the case of a\r\npoor wretch broken upon the wheel. In his agonies he blasphemed in the\r\nmost fearful manner, and cordially damned the spiritual comforter who\r\nsought to reconcile him to his sufferings. Some itinerant musicians\r\nchanced to pass by, they were stopped by the priest and requested to play\r\nto the patient, when to the surprise of all around, he seemed relieved,\r\nand became so tranquil, that he attended with calm resignation to their\r\nexhortations, confessed his manifold offences, and died like a good\r\nChristian.\r\n\r\nRousseau, who entertained a sovereign contempt for French music, observes,\r\nthat the _Cantates_ of Bernier cured the fever of a French musician, while\r\nthey most probably would have given a fever to a musician of any other\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis remark of Rousseau reminds me of the French philosophical traveller\r\n(I believe it was Diderot), who on his journey to London from Dover, while\r\nhorses were changing, had the curiosity to see a sick ostler with a raging\r\nfever attended by a country practitioner, who, despairing most probably of\r\nhis patient, said, that he might be allowed to eat any thing he wished\r\nfor. The man asked for a red-herring, which was forthwith given to him.\r\nOur tourist, generalizing like most of his brethren, immediately noted in\r\nhis diary--_English Physicians allow red-herrings to fever patients_.\r\n\r\nSome months after he changed horses at the same inn, and asked how long\r\nthe unfortunate creature had survived his herring, when, to his utter\r\nsurprise, he was informed that the hale, hearty fellow who was bringing\r\nout the relays, was the very man. He of course pulled out his journal and\r\nentered--_red-herrings cure the fever of Englishmen_.\r\n\r\nOur traveller crossed over, and having accidentally seen in a French inn a\r\npoor devil whose case appeared to him similar to the sturdy ostler, he\r\nventured to prescribe a similar remedy, which the patient only survived an\r\nhour or two; when his death was announced, he philosophically shrugged up\r\nhis shoulders, and wrote in his book--_Though red-herrings cure fevers in\r\nEngland, they most decidedly kill in France_.\r\n\r\nMad musicians seem to be more mad than others; for Fodere gives us the\r\nfollowing strange account of some of them. \"Les plus grands musiciens ne\r\nreconnaissent souvent plus leurs instruments: l'un prenant son violon, que\r\nje lui avais mis dans les mains, pour un vase de nuit, et un autre prenant\r\nsa flute pour un sabre, et voulait m'en frapper.\"\r\n\r\nWe, however, frequently meet with lunatics who, although they have no\r\nremembrance of the past circumstances of their life, recollect and perform\r\nairs which they had formerly played.\r\n\r\nVarious well-authenticated cases lead us to suppose, that a sensibility to\r\nmusic long latent may be called into action by accidental circumstances. A\r\ncase is on record of a countrywoman, twenty-eight years of age, who had\r\nnever left her village, but was, by mere chance, present at a _fete_ where\r\na concert was performed, and dancing to a full band afterwards followed.\r\nShe was delighted with the novelty of the scene; but, the _fete_\r\nconcluded, she could not dismiss from her mind the impression the music\r\nhad produced. Whether she was at her meals, her devotions, her daily\r\noccupation, or in her bed,--still, or moving about,--the airs she had\r\nheard, and in the succession in which they had been performed, were ever\r\npresent to her recollection. To sleep she became a stranger,--every\r\nfunction became gradually deranged, and six short months terminated her\r\nexistence, not having for one moment lost this strange sensation; and\r\nduring this sad period, when any false note on the violin was purposely\r\ndrawn, she would hold her head with both hands, and exclaim, \"Oh! what a\r\nhorrible note! it tears my brain!\"\r\n\r\nSir Henry Halford relates the case of a man in Yorkshire, who after severe\r\nmisfortunes lost his senses, and was placed in a lunatic asylum. There, in\r\na short time, the use of the violin gradually restored him to his\r\nintellects; so promptly, indeed, that six weeks after the experiment, on\r\nhearing the inmates of the establishment passing by, he said, \"Good\r\nmorning, gentlemen; I am quite well, and shall be most happy to accompany\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nCurious anecdotes are related of the effect of music upon animals.\r\nMarville has given the following amusing account of his experiments.\r\n\"While a man was playing on a trump-marine, I made my observations on a\r\ncat, a dog, a horse, an ass, a hind, some cows, small birds, and a cock\r\nand hens, who were in a yard under the window: the cat was not the least\r\naffected; the horse stopped short from time to time, raising his head up\r\nnow and then as he was feeding on the grass; the dog continued for above\r\nan hour seated on his hind-legs, looking steadfastly at the player; the\r\nass did not discover the least indication of his being touched, eating his\r\nthistles peaceably; the hind lifted up her large wide ears, and seemed\r\nvery attentive; the cows slept a little, and, after gazing at us, went\r\nforward; some little birds that were in an aviary, and others on trees and\r\nbushes, almost tore their little throats with singing; but the cock, who\r\nminded only his hens, and the hens, who were solely employed in scraping\r\na neighbouring dunghill, did not show in any manner that the trump-marine\r\nafforded them pleasure.\" That dogs have an ear for music cannot be\r\ndoubted: Steibelt had one which evidently knew one piece of music from the\r\nother: and a modern composer, my friend, Mr. Nathan, had a pug-dog that\r\nfrisked merrily about the room when a lively piece was played, but when a\r\nslow melody was performed, particularly Dussek's Opera 15, he would seat\r\nhimself down by the piano, and prick up his ears with intense attention\r\nuntil the player came to the forty-eighth bar; as the discord was struck,\r\nhe would yell most piteously, and with drooping tail seek refuge from the\r\nunpleasant sound under the chairs or tables.[10]\r\n\r\nEastcot relates that a hare left her retreat to listen to some choristers\r\nwho were singing on the banks of the Mersey, retiring whenever they ceased\r\nsinging, and reappearing as they recommenced their strains. Bossuet\r\nasserts, that an officer confined in the Bastille drew forth mice and\r\nspiders to beguile his solitude with his flute; and a mountebank in Paris\r\nhad taught rats to dance on the rope in perfect time. Chateaubriand states\r\nas a positive fact, that he has seen the rattlesnakes in Upper Canada\r\nappeased by a musician; and the concert given in Paris to two elephants in\r\nthe Jardin des Plantes leaves no doubt in regard to the effect of harmony\r\non the brute creation. Every instrument seemed to operate distinctly as\r\nthe several modes of pieces were slow or lively, until the excitement of\r\nthese intelligent creatures had been carried to such an extent that\r\nfurther experiments were deemed dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe associations produced by national airs, and illustrated by the effect\r\nof the _Rans des Vaches_ upon the Swiss, are too well known to be related;\r\nand the _mal de pays_, or _nostalgia_, is an affection aggravated by the\r\nfond airs of infancy and youth during the sad hours of emigration, when\r\nthe aching heart lingers after home and early ties of friendship and of\r\nlove. It is somewhat singular, but this disease is frequent among soldiers\r\nin countries where they are forcibly made to march: but is seldom, if\r\never, observed in the fair sex, who most probably seek for admiration in\r\nevery clime, and are reconciled by flattery to any region.\r\n\r\nThe whims of musical composers have often been most singular; Gluck\r\ncomposed in a garden, quaffing champaign; Sarti, in a dark room;\r\nPaesiello, in his bed; Sacchini, with a favourite cat perched upon each\r\nshoulder. The extraordinary fancies of Kutswara, composer of the \"Battle\r\nof Prague,\" are too well known, and led to his melancholy, but unpitied\r\nend.\r\n\r\nGreat as the repute of the most popular musical performers, whether vocal\r\nor instrumental, in the present day may be, and enormous as their\r\nremuneration may seem, the ancients were more profuse in their generosity\r\nto musicians and the factors of musical instruments. Plutarch, in his life\r\nof Isocrates, tells us that he was the son of Theodorus, a flute-maker,\r\nwho had realized so large a fortune by his business, that he was able to\r\nvie with the richest Athenian citizens in keeping up the chorus for his\r\ntribe at festivals and religious ceremonies. Ismenias, the celebrated\r\nmusician of Thebes, gave three talents, or 581_l._ 5_s._ for a flute. The\r\nextravagance of this performer was so great, that Pliny informs us he was\r\nindignant at one of his agents for having purchased a valuable emerald for\r\nhim at Cyprus at too low a price, adding, that by his penurious conduct he\r\nhad disgraced the gem. The vanity of artists in those days appears to have\r\nbeen similar to the present impudent pretensions of many public\r\nfavourites. Plutarch relates of this same Ismenias, that being sent for to\r\nplay at a sacrifice, and having performed for some time without the\r\nappearance of any favourable omen in the victim, his employer snatched the\r\ninstrument out of his hand, and began to play himself most execrably.\r\nHowever, the happy omen appeared, when the delighted bungler exclaimed\r\nthat the gods preferred his execution and taste. Ismenias cast upon him a\r\nsmile of contempt, and replied, \"While _I_ played, the gods were so\r\nenchanted that they deferred the omen to hear me the longer; but they were\r\nglad to get rid of _you_ upon any terms.\" This was nearly as absurd as the\r\nboast of Vestris, the Parisian dancer, who, on being complimented on his\r\npowers of remaining long in the air, replied, \"that he could figure in the\r\nair for half an hour, did he not fear to create jealousy among his\r\ncomrades.\"\r\n\r\nAmoebaeus the harper, according to Athenaeus, used to receive an Attic\r\ntalent of 193_l._ 15_s._ for each performance. The beautiful Lamia, the\r\nmost celebrated female flute-player, had a temple dedicated to her under\r\nthe name of Venus Lamia. The _Tibicinae_, or female flute-players, who\r\nformed collegiate bodies, were as celebrated for their talent and their\r\ncharms, as for their licentiousness and extravagance. Their performances\r\nwere forbidden by the Theodosian code, but with little success; since\r\nProcopius informs us that, in the time of Justinian the sister of the\r\nEmpress Theodora, who was a renowned amateur _tibicina_, appeared on the\r\nstage without any other dress than a slight and transparent scarf.\r\n\r\nIn the early ages of Christianity, the power of music in adding to\r\nreligious solemnity was fully appreciated, and many of the fathers and\r\nmost distinguished prelates cultivated the auxiliary science. St. Gregory\r\nexpressly sent over Augustine the monk, with some singers, who entered the\r\ncity of Canterbury singing a litany in the Gregorian chant, which extended\r\nthe number of the four tones of St. Ambrose to eight. A school for church\r\nmusic was established at Canterbury; and it was also taught in the diocese\r\nof Durham and Weremouth. St. Dunstan was a celebrated musician, and was\r\naccused of having invented a most wonderful magic harp; it was, perhaps,\r\nto prove that the accusation was false, that he took the devil by the nose\r\nwith a pair of tongs. This ingenious saint is said to be the inventor of\r\norgans, one of which he bestowed on the abbey of Malmesbury. It appears,\r\nhowever, that instruments resembling the organ were known as early as 364,\r\nand were described in a Greek epigram attributed to Julian the Apostate,\r\nin which he says, \"I beheld reeds of a new species, the growth of each\r\nother, and a brazen soil; such as are not agitated by winds, but by a\r\nblast that rushes from a leathern cavern beneath their roots; while a\r\nrobust mortal, running with swift fingers over the concordant keys, makes\r\nthem, as they smoothly dance, emit melodious sounds.\"\r\n\r\nThe influence of music on the fair sex has long been acknowledged, and\r\nthis advantage has proved fatal to some artists who had recourse to its\r\nfascinating powers; Mark Smeaton was involved in the misfortunes of Anne\r\nBoleyn; Thomas Abel, who taught harmony to Catherine, met with a similar\r\nfate, and David Rizzio was not more fortunate. They were, perhaps, too\r\nmuch impressed with the ideas of Cloten: \"I am advis'd to give her music\r\no' mornings; they say it will penetrate.\"\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that no woman was ever known to excel in musical\r\ncomposition, however brilliant her instrumental execution might have been.\r\nThe same observation has been made in regard to logical disquisitions. To\r\nwhat are we to attribute this exception?--are we to consider these\r\ndelightful tormentors as essentially unharmonious and illogical? We leave\r\nthis important question to phrenologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FOOD OF MANKIND. ITS USE AND ABUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDestined by Providence to wander over the globe, and to live in various\r\nclimes, man is essentially an omnivorous animal. According to the country\r\nhe inhabits, its productions and the nature of his pursuits, his mode of\r\nliving differs. The inhabitant of cold and sterile regions on the borders\r\nof the ocean becomes ichthyophagous; and fish, fresh, dried, smoked, or\r\nsalted, is his principal nourishment. The bold huntsman lives upon the\r\ngame he pursues; while the nomadian shepherd, who tends his herd over\r\nboundless steeps, supports himself on the milk of his flock. In warm\r\ncountries fruits and vegetables constitute the chief support of life; and\r\nthere the disciples of Pythagoras can luxuriate on the rich produce of a\r\nbountiful soil, solely debarring themselves from beans, which, like all\r\nflesh, they consider to have been created by putrefaction. What would\r\nthese good people have done among the Scythians and the Getae, who,\r\naccording to Sidonius Apollinaris, mingled blood and milk for food--\r\n\r\n  ------------------Solitosque cruentum\r\n  Lac potare Getas, ac pocula tingere venis;\r\n\r\nor the stunted natives of the arctic regions, who feed upon whales and\r\nseals, drink deep potations of train-oil, and consider the warm blood of\r\nthe seal an exquisite beverage, dried herrings moistened with blubber a\r\ndainty, and the flesh of the seal half frozen in snow during winter, or\r\nhalf corrupted in the earth in summer, the most delicious morsel. The\r\nsemi-barbarous Russians, who during the late wars enjoyed the abundant\r\nbills of fare of France and Italy, accustom themselves easily to this\r\ndisgusting diet on their return; and their troops, who live amongst the\r\nSamoiedes, thrive uncommonly well on raw flesh and rein-deer blood. It is\r\nin temperate regions that man displays his omnivorous propensities: there,\r\nanimal food can be abundantly procured; and every description of grain,\r\nroots, and fruit, is easily cultivated. It is as we pass from these middle\r\nclimes towards the poles, that animal substances are more exclusively\r\nconsumed; and towards the equator that we enjoy refreshing fruits, and\r\nnourishing roots and vegetables. So scarce is food in some desolate\r\ntracts of the globe, that we find the wandering Indian satisfying his\r\ncravings with earth and clay: and Humboldt informs us that the Ottomaques,\r\non the banks of the Mata and Oronoco, feed on a fat unctuous earth, in the\r\nchoice of which they display great epicurean skill, and which they knead\r\ninto balls of four or six inches in diameter, and bake slowly over the\r\nfire. When about to be used, these clods are soaked in water, and each\r\nindividual consumes about a pound of them in the day; the only addition\r\nwhich they occasionally make to this strange fare consists in small fish,\r\nlizards, and fern-roots.\r\n\r\nThe art of cookery has improved, no doubt, with the progressive advance\r\nand development of our other institutions; and it seems to prove that the\r\nemployment of all kinds of food is as natural to man, as a stationary\r\nuniformity and restriction of one species of aliment is to animals. A most\r\nerroneous idea has prevailed regarding the use of animal food, which has\r\nbeen considered as the best calculated to render mankind robust and\r\ncourageous. This is disproved by observation. The miserable and timid\r\ninhabitants of Northern Europe and Asia are remarkable for their moral and\r\nphysical debility, although they chiefly live on fish or raw flesh;\r\nwhereas the athletic Scotch and Irish are certainly not weaker than their\r\nEnglish neighbours, though consuming but little meat. The strength and\r\nagility of the negroes is well known, and the South Sea islanders can vie\r\nin bodily exercises with our stoutest seamen. We have reason to believe,\r\nthat, at the most glorious periods of Grecian and Roman power, their\r\narmies were principally subsisted upon bread, vegetables, and fruits.\r\n\r\nMan by his natural structure was created omnivorous, and there is no doubt\r\nbut that a judicious mixed alimentation is the best calculated to ensure\r\nhealth and vigour, and enable the ambitious or the industrious wanderer to\r\nspend his winters near the poles, colonize beneath the equator, or inhabit\r\nregions where the hardiest of animals must starve and die. The teeth, the\r\njaws, all the digestive organs fit him for this mode of existence. There\r\nis a curious passage in one of Dr. Franklin's letters in regard to wine:\r\nhe pleasantly observes, that the only animals created to drink water are\r\nthose who from their conformation are able to lap it on the surface of the\r\nearth, whereas all those who can carry their hands to their mouth were\r\ndestined to enjoy the juice of the grape.\r\n\r\nThe diversity of substances which we find in the catalogue of articles of\r\nfood is as great as the variety with which the art or the science of\r\ncookery prepares them: the notions of the ancients on this most important\r\nsubject are worthy of remark. Their taste regarding meat was various. Beef\r\nthey considered the most substantial food; hence it constituted the chief\r\nnourishment of their athletae. Camels' and dromedaries' flesh was much\r\nesteemed, their heels most especially. Donkey-flesh was in high repute;\r\nMaecenas, according to Pliny, delighted in it; and the wild ass, brought\r\nfrom Africa, was compared to venison. In more modern times we find\r\nChancellor Dupret having asses fattened for his table. The hog and the\r\nwild boar appear to have been held in great estimation; and a hog was\r\ncalled \"animal propter convivia natum;\" but the classical portion of the\r\nsow was somewhat singular--\"vulva nil dulcius ampla.\" Their mode of\r\nkilling swine was as refined in barbarity as in epicurism. Plutarch tells\r\nus that the gravid sow was actually trampled to death, to form a delicious\r\nmass fit for the gods. At other times, pigs were slaughtered with red-hot\r\nspits, that the blood might not be lost; stuffing a pig with asafoetida\r\nand various small animals, was a luxury called \"porcus Trojanus;\"\r\nalluding, no doubt, to the warriors who were concealed in the Trojan\r\nhorse. Young bears, dogs, and foxes, (the latter more esteemed when fed\r\nupon grapes,) were also much admired by the Romans; who were also so fond\r\nof various birds, that some consular families assumed the names of those\r\nthey most esteemed. Catius tells us how to drown fowls in Falernian wine,\r\nto render them more luscious and tender. Pheasants were brought over from\r\nColchis, and deemed at one time such a rarity, that one of the Ptolemies\r\nbitterly lamented his having never tasted any. Peacocks were carefully\r\nreared in the island of Samos, and sold at such a high price, that Varro\r\ninforms us they fetched yearly upwards of 2000_l._ of our money. The\r\nguinea-fowl was considered delicious; but, wretched people! the Romans\r\nknew not the turkey, a gift which we moderns owe to the Jesuits. Who could\r\nvilify the disciples of Loyola after this information! The ostrich was\r\nmuch relished; Heliogabalus delighted in their brains, and Apicius\r\nespecially commends them. But, of all birds, the flamingo was not only\r\nesteemed as a _bonne-bouche_, but was most valuable after dinner; for,\r\nwhen the gluttonous sensualists had eaten too much, they introduced one of\r\nits long scarlet feathers down their throats, to disgorge their dinner.\r\nThe modern gastronome is perhaps not aware that it is to the ancients he\r\nowes his delicious fattened duck and goose livers,--the inestimable _foies\r\ngras_ of France. Thus Horace:\r\n\r\n  Pinguibus et ficis pastum jecur anseris albi.\r\n\r\nThe swan was also fattened by the Romans, who first deprived it of sight;\r\nand cranes were by no means despised by people of taste. In later days the\r\nswan seems to have been in great estimation in our own country. We find in\r\nthe Northumberland household book that in one year twenty of these birds\r\nwere consumed at the earl's table.\r\n\r\nWhile the feathered creation was doomed to form part of ancient delights,\r\nthe waters yielded their share of enjoyments, and several fishes were\r\nimmortalized. The _muraena Helena_ was educated in their ponds, and\r\nrendered so tame that he came to be killed at the tinkling of his master's\r\nbell or the sound of his voice.\r\n\r\n  Natat ad magistrum delicta muraena,\r\n\r\nsays Martial. Hirtius ceded six thousand of these fish to Caesar as a great\r\nfavour, and Vitellius delighted in their roe. The fame of the lamprey,\r\n_mustela_ of Ausonius and Pliny, is generally known; and the sturgeon, the\r\n_acipenser sturio_, was brought to table with triumphant pomp: but the\r\nturbot, one of which was brought to Domitian from Ancona, was considered\r\nsuch a present from the gods, that this emperor assembled the senate to\r\nadmire it. Soles were also so delectable that punning on the word _solea_,\r\nthey were called the _soles_ of the gods: the dorad, _sparus auratus_, was\r\nconsecrated to Venus; the _labrus scarus_ was called the brain of Jupiter,\r\nand Apuleius and Epicharmus maintain that its very entrails would be\r\nrelished in Olympus.\r\n\r\nTo these dainties may be added the _Alphestae_, a fish always caught in\r\npairs from their eagerness to be eaten. The _Amia_ so very delicious that\r\nthe Athenians defied the worst cook to spoil them. The _Gnaphius_ that\r\nimparted to the water that had had the honour to boil them, the facility\r\nof taking out all stains. The _Pompilus_ which sprang with Venus from the\r\nblood of the sky. The fish called _fox_ by the Rhodians, and _dog_ by the\r\nBoeotians, was considered such a dainty that Archestratus recommended\r\nepicures to steal them if they could not procure them by honest means;\r\nadding, that all calamities should be considered immaterial after a man\r\nhad once feasted on such a luscious morsel, too divine to be gazed upon\r\nby vulgar eyes, and which ought to be procured by the wealthy, if they did\r\nnot wish to incur the wrath of the gods, for not appreciating at its true\r\nvalue the flower of their nectar. Eels were also highly esteemed by the\r\nancients. The preference being given to the _Copaic_, which the\r\nBoeotians offered to the gods crowned with flowers, giving them the same\r\nrank among fish that Helen held amongst women.\r\n\r\nThe _garum_, or celebrated fish-sauce of the Romans, was principally made\r\nout of the _sciaena umbra_, and the mackerel; the entrails and blood being\r\nmacerated in brine until they became putrid.\r\n\r\n  Expirantis adhuc scombri, de sanguine primo\r\n  Accipe fastosum munera cara garum:--\r\n\r\nthus says Martial: and Galen affirms that this disgusting preparation was\r\nso precious, that a measure of about three or four pints fetched two\r\nthousand silver pieces. So delightful was the effluvium of the garum\r\nconsidered, that Martial informs us it was carried about in onyx\r\nsmelling-bottles. But our luxurious civic chiefs are not aware that the\r\nred mullet--for such I believe was the _mullus_--was held in such a\r\ndistinguished category among genteel fishes, that three of them, although\r\nof small size, were known to fetch upwards of 200_l._ They were more\r\nappreciated when brought alive, and gradually allowed to die, immersed in\r\nthe delicious garum; when the Romans feasted their eyes in the anticipated\r\ndelight of eating them, by gazing on the dying creature as he changed\r\ncolour like an expiring dolphin. Seneca reproaches them with this\r\nrefinement of cruelty--\"Oculis quoque gulosi sunt;\" and the most renowned\r\nof Apicius's culinary discoveries was the _alec_, a compound of their\r\nlivers.\r\n\r\nSnails were also a great dainty. Fulvius Herpinus was immortalized for the\r\ndiscovery of the art of fattening them on bran and other articles; and\r\nHorace informs us they were served up, broiled upon silver gridirons, to\r\ngive a relish to wine. Oysters were brought from our coasts to Rome, and\r\nfrozen oysters were much extolled. Grasshoppers, locusts, and various\r\ninsects, were equally acceptable to our first gastronomic legislators.\r\nAcorns, similar to those now eaten in Spain, formed part of a Roman\r\ndessert; the best were brought from Naples and Tarentum. It does not\r\nappear that the ancients had a great variety in their vegetable diet;\r\ncondiments to stimulate the sluggish appetite seemed to be their principal\r\nresearch: amongst these the asafoetida, which is to this day highly\r\nrelished in the East, was an indispensable ingredient; this has been\r\ndoubted by various naturalists, but it appears certain, since Pliny\r\ninforms us that it was frequently adulterated by _sagapenum_, which bears\r\nthe strongest resemblance to it. This substance was called _laser_, and by\r\nmany tasteless persons, such as Aristophanes and Apuleius, considered\r\noffensive and disgusting; hence the latter, \"lasere infectas carnes,\" and\r\n\"laseratum porcellum.\" According to Theophrastus, asafoetida was\r\ncollected and preserved, as it is at present, in skins; and, despite its\r\nestimation as a culinary ingredient, it was not unfrequently named\r\n_stercus diaboli_. In addition to this gum, they seasoned their food with\r\nvarious other strong articles, such as coriander and cummin seeds, sumac,\r\nsaffron, cinnamon, thyme; with divers peppers, salt, and sal-ammoniac.\r\n\r\nInstead of bread, which was only introduced in Rome 580, A. D. they used a\r\nheavy kind of unleavened paste, similar to the present _polenta_. This\r\nnourishment occasioned frequent indigestion, hence the use of warm water\r\nafter meals, and the necessity of emetics. Warm water was sold about the\r\nstreets in their thermopolia, and Seneca observed the paleness and\r\ndebility that arose from its use and abuse; a practice recorded by\r\nMartial:\r\n\r\n  Et potet calidam, qui mihi livet, aquam.\r\n\r\nWhile water was thus freely drunk, wine was not disregarded; but the\r\nvarious articles with which it was adulterated, must have rendered it any\r\nthing but a delectable potation according to our received ideas. Thus we\r\nsee the Greeks putting salt and sea-water in theirs; at other times\r\ndissolving mastic and myrrha, or infusing wormwood, in their choicest\r\nFalernian. Like modern tasters, however, they knew the method of\r\ndeveloping the _bouquet_ by warmth; and, to appreciate the flavour, they\r\nfrequently added hot water. That wines of a resinous taste were esteemed,\r\nappears from Martial:\r\n\r\n  Resinata bibis vina, Falerna fugis.\r\n\r\nBut we may conclude that, according to our modern taste, their boasted\r\nwines did not equal ours either in flavour or in delicacy.\r\n\r\nThe ancients however were very careful in the preparation of their bread,\r\njustly called the \"staff of life,\" as constituting one of the most\r\nwholesome and nutritious parts of our food. The Athenian bakers bore the\r\npalm in the confection of this article. Archestratus recommended the\r\nwheaten bread of Athens and the barley meal of Lesbos, which their poets\r\nasserted was supplied to the gods. The Grecian millet bread was also in\r\ngreat repute, while delicious bread was also made with the _Zea_, the\r\n_Triticum Spella_ of Linnaeus and the _Far_ of the Romans. A species of\r\nwheat called _Tiphe_ was also much esteemed. Brown bread was made of a\r\ngrain called _Olyra_, and it was with loaves of this description that\r\nHomer's heroes fed their horses.\r\n\r\nIt appears that great attention was paid to the kneeding and the boulting:\r\nunboulted meal was called _Syncomista_, and when finely boulted in a\r\nwoollen cloth, _Semidalis_. The most approved method of baking was in the\r\n_Cribanus_ or _Clibanus_, an earthen or iron vessel, which they surrounded\r\nwith charcoal. Bread according to its superior or inferior quality was\r\nconsecrated to various divinities. Thus the goddesses used the _Homoros_,\r\nand Hecate was served with the _Hemiantium_, but we are unacquainted with\r\nthe preparation of these varieties. The flour of barley was used by the\r\n_Canephorae_, or virgins that bore the sacred baskets in the festivals of\r\nCeres, to sprinkle themselves. Bread according to its particular kind was\r\nserved up in various ways; wheaten bread was brought to table upon fresh\r\nleaves; barley bread upon a layer of reeds. At the feasts of Ceres and\r\nProserpine, a large loaf was kneeded and baked by the ladies of Delos,\r\ncalled _Achainas_ which gave the name to the festival, instituted most\r\nprobably in Achaia, to commemorate the invention of bread, which Ceres\r\ntaught to Eumelus, a citizen of Patrae.\r\n\r\nBarley for the preparation of bread was used long before wheat or any\r\nother sort of corn, and hence Artemidorus calls it _Antiquissimum in\r\ncibis_. It was also given to the athletae who were thence called\r\n_Hordearii_. In latter times it was chiefly given to cattle, although used\r\nby the poorer classes. Barley bread was also issued to soldiers as a\r\npunishment, the loss of wheaten bread being considered a great privation.\r\nVegetius tells us that soldiers who had been guilty of any offence were\r\nthus punished--\"_hordeum pro frumentuo cogebantur accipere_.\" In the\r\nsecond Punic war we find Marcellus sentencing the cohorts that had lost\r\ntheir standards to this infliction. Suetonius also informs us that\r\nAugustus only allowed barley to the troops that had misbehaved in action.\r\n_Cohortes, si quae cepissent, loco, decimatas hordeo pavit._ But there is\r\nreason to believe that under the head of bread were included various kinds\r\nof cakes, many of which were prepared with honey, some of them were\r\ncalled _Placentae omnigenae_, and were prepared by bakers who bore the name\r\nof _pistores dulciarii_. This honied bread or cake it appears, was\r\nfrequently resorted to, as in the present day, to quiet troublesome\r\nchildren as well as to please the taste of fastidious patients. Thus\r\nMartial:\r\n\r\n  Leniat ut fauces medicus, quas aspera vexat\r\n  Assidue tussis, Parthenopae tibi\r\n  Mella dari, nucleosque jubet dulcesque placentas.\r\n  Est quidquid pueros non sinit esse truces,\r\n  At tu non cessas totis tussire diebus\r\n  Non est haec tussis, Parthenopae gula est.\r\n\r\nThe bread made of spring wheat was called _Collabus_, and the Athenians\r\nconsidered a toasted _Collabus_ eaten with a slice of a pig's belly, the\r\nvery best cure for a surfeit occasioned by an excess in anchovies,\r\nespecially the Phalerian ones, which were deemed fit for the gods.\r\n\r\nFragments of bread it appears were used instead of napkins to wipe the\r\nfingers on. These were called _Apomygdaliae_, with which Aristophanes fed\r\nhis sausage-makers. These dainty bits were usually thrown to dogs.\r\n\r\nThe cooks of the ancients appear to have been much more consummate in\r\ntheir art than our modern practitioners. Athenaeus records various\r\ndescriptions of their incomparable science. A new dish immortalized its\r\ninventor, and transmitted his name to posterity. Apicius's cakes were\r\ncalled Apicians; and Aristoxenes had attained such perfection in curing\r\nhams, that the glorious appellation of Aristoxenians was bestowed upon\r\nthem. Philosophers and poets gloried in their culinary science; the\r\npleasures of the table were the subject of their writings and their\r\nconversation. Archestratus tells us with delight, that, although various\r\ndelicacies can only be enjoyed in their proper season, yet we can talk\r\nabout them with watering mouths all the year round.\r\n\r\nOne of these illustrious ministers of luxury attained such a degree of\r\nenviable perfection, that he could serve up a pig boiled on one side and\r\nroasted on the other, and moreover stuffed with all possible delicacies,\r\nwithout the incision through which these dainties were introduced being\r\nperceived. Supplicated to explain this wonderful secret, he swore solemnly\r\nby the manes of all the heroes who fell at Marathon, or conquered at\r\nSalamis, that he would not reveal this sacred mystery for one year. When\r\nthe happy day arrived and he was no longer bound by his vows, he\r\ncondescended to inform his anxious hearers, that the animal had been bled\r\nto death by a wound under the shoulder, through which the entrails were\r\nextracted; and afterwards hanging up the victim by the legs, the stuffing\r\nwas crammed down his throat. One half of the pig was then covered with a\r\nthick paste, seasoned with wine and oil, put into a brass oven, and gently\r\nand tenderly roasted: when the skin was brown and crisp, our hero\r\nproceeded to boil the other moiety; the paste was then removed, and the\r\nboiled and roasted grunter triumphantly served up.\r\n\r\nSo refined was the taste of the ancient _bons vivans_, that Montanus,\r\naccording to Juvenal, would proclaim, at the first bite, whether an oyster\r\nwas of English produce or not. Sandwich is believed to have been the\r\nfavoured spot whence Rome imported her oysters and other shell-fish.\r\nShrimps and prawns must have been in great estimation, since we find\r\nApicius quitting his residence at Minturnae, upon hearing that the shrimps\r\nof Africa were finer than those he could procure in Campania. He instantly\r\nset sail for the happy coast, despite a gale of wind: after encountering a\r\ndesperate storm, he reached the wished-for land of promise; but alas!--the\r\nfishermen displayed the largest prawns they could collect, and to his\r\ncruel disappointment, they could not vie, either in delicacy or beauty,\r\nwith those of Minturnae. He immediately ordered his pilot to steer a\r\nhomeward course, and left Africa's shore with ineffable contempt.\r\n\r\nThese ingenious gluttons had recourse to every experiment that could add\r\nto their enjoyment. Philoxenus, and many others, used to accustom\r\nthemselves to swallow hot water, that they might be able to attack\r\nscalding dishes before less fireproof guests would dare to taste them.\r\n\r\nSinon maintained that cookery was the basis of all arts and sciences:\r\nnatural philosophy taught us the seasoning of dishes; architecture\r\ndirected the construction of stoves and chimneys; the fine arts, the\r\nbeautiful symmetry of each dish; and the principles of war were applied to\r\nthe drilling and marshalling of cooks, confectioners, and scullions,\r\nposting proper sentries to watch the fires, and videttes to keep off idle\r\nintruders. That man is a \"cooking animal\" is considered one of his\r\nproudest attributes, and a proper bill of fare may be considered as the\r\n_ne plus ultra_ of human genius!\r\n\r\nIt may be easily imagined that when good living became a science,\r\n_sponging_ upon the wealthy _Amphitryons_ became an art amongst the needy\r\n_bons vivants_, and parasites, as in the present day, were ever seen\r\nfawning and cringing for their dinner. These sycophants stuck so close to\r\ntheir patrons, that they were called shadows. Thus Horace:\r\n\r\n  ----Quos Moecenas adduxerat umbras.\r\n\r\nThey were also called flies, [Greek: gyias], by the Greeks, and _Muscae_ by\r\nthe Romans; no doubt from their constant buzzing about the object of their\r\ndevotion. Plautus calls an entertainment free from these despicable\r\nguests, _Hospitium sine muscis_. Horus Apollo tells us that in Egypt a fly\r\nwas the symbol of an impudent fellow; because, although driven away, it\r\nwill constantly return. We have, however, reason to believe that the term\r\n_parasite_ was originally applied to the followers of princes, Patroclus\r\nwas the parasite of Achilles, and Memnon of Idomeneus; it was only in\r\nlater times that the appellation was given to despicable characters and\r\n\"_trencher friends_.\"\r\n\r\nOur Shakspeare had adopted the term of the ancients, as appears in the\r\nfollowing passages:\r\n\r\n  In such as you,\r\n  That creep like _shadows_ by him, and do sigh\r\n  At each his needless heavings.\r\n\r\nAnd again--\r\n\r\n  Feast-won, fast-lost, one cloud of winter showers.\r\n  These _flies_ are couched.\r\n\r\nWhile climate points out the most suitable articles of food, it exercises\r\na singular influence over their qualities and properties, more especially\r\nin vegetable substances. We find plants which are poisonous in some\r\ncountries, edible and wholesome in others. Next to climate, culture and\r\nsoil modify plants to a singular degree: flowers which yield a powerful\r\nperfume in some latitudes, are inodorous in others; and, according to\r\nclimate, their aroma is pleasant or distressing. A striking proof of this\r\nfact can be adduced from the well-known effects of perfumes in Rome; where\r\nthe inhabitants, especially females, cannot support the scent even of the\r\nrose, which has been known to produce syncope, illustrating the poet's\r\nline to\r\n\r\n  Die of a rose in aromatic pain.\r\n\r\nThis variety in the action of vegetable substances is more particularly\r\nobservable in such as are considered medicinal. Opium, narcotics, and\r\nvarious drugs, are more powerful in warm climates than in northern\r\nregions. The Italian physicians express astonishment at the comparatively\r\nlarge doses prescribed by our practitioners.\r\n\r\nCultivation brings forth singular intermediate productions; and by its\r\nmagic power we have seen the coriaceous and bitter almond transformed into\r\nthe luscious peach, the sloe converted into the delicious plum, and the\r\ncommon crab transformed into the golden pippin. The same facts are\r\nobserved in vegetables; the celery sprung from the nauseous and bitter\r\n_apium graveolens_, and the colewort, is metamorphosed into the cabbage\r\nand the cauliflower. All cruciform plants degenerate within the tropics,\r\nbut acquire increased energies in cold countries.\r\n\r\nRecent experiments in Germany have demonstrated that in times of scarcity,\r\nthe wood of several trees may be converted into a nutritious substance.\r\nThe fibres of the beech, birch, lime, poplar, fir, and various other\r\ntrees, when dried, ground, and sifted into an impalpable powder,\r\nconstitute a very palatable article of food. If cold water be poured on\r\nthis ligneous flour, enclosed in a linen bag, it becomes milky, and\r\nconsiderable pressure and kneading is required to express the amylaceous\r\nor starchy part of it. Professor Von Buch, in his travels through Norway\r\nand Lapland, has fully described the Norwegian _barke brod_. We find the\r\nsavages scattered along the coast of the great austral continent mixing up\r\na paste of the bark of the gum-tree with the ants and the other insects,\r\nwith their larvae, which they find in it. Ground dried fish and fish-bones\r\nhave from time immemorial been converted into bread; Arrianus tells us\r\nthat Nearchus found several nations on the shores of the Red Sea living\r\nupon a bread of this description.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that all substances from the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdom appear to afford more or less nutriment, provided that they\r\ncontain no elements unlike the animal matter of the being they are\r\nintended to nourish. All others are either medicinal or poisonous. Food\r\nmay be considered nourishing in the ratio of its easy digestion or\r\nsolution. Magendie attributes the nutritious principle to the greater or\r\nlesser proportion of nitrogen or azote. According to his view of the\r\nsubject, the substances that contain little or no nitrogen are the\r\nsaccharine and acid fruits, oils, fats, butter, mucilaginous vegetables,\r\nrefined sugar, starch, gum, vegetable mucus, and vegetable gelatin. The\r\ndifferent kinds of corn, rice and potatoes, are elements of the same kind.\r\nThe azotical aliments, on the contrary, are vegetable albumen, gluten, and\r\nthose principles which are met with in the seeds, stems and leaves of\r\ngrasses and herbs, the seeds of leguminous plants, such as peas and\r\nbeans, and most animal substances, with the exception of fat.\r\n\r\nTo this doctrine, it was objected, that animals who feed upon substances\r\ncontaining little nitrogen, and the field negroes, who consume large\r\nquantities of sugar, might be adduced as an exception. Magendie replies,\r\nthat almost all the vegetables consumed by man and animals contain more or\r\nless nitrogen--that this element enters in large quantity in the\r\ncomposition of impure sugar--and lastly, that the nations whose principal\r\nfood consists in rice, maize, or potatoes, consume at the same time milk\r\nand cheese.\r\n\r\nTo support his theory, this physiologist had recourse to various curious\r\nexperiments on dogs, whom he fed with substances which contained no\r\nnitrogen. During the first seven or eight days, the animals were brisk and\r\nactive, and took their food and drink as usual. In the course of the\r\nsecond week they began to get thin, although their appetite continued\r\ngood, and they took daily between six and eight ounces of sugar. The\r\nemaciation increased during the third week; they became feeble, lost their\r\nappetite and activity, and at the same time ulcers appeared in the cornea\r\nof their eyes. The animals still continued to eat three or four ounces of\r\nsugar daily, but, nevertheless, became at length so feeble as to be\r\nincapable of motion, and died on a day varying from the 31st to the 34th:\r\nand it must be recollected that dogs will live the same length of time\r\nwithout any food.\r\n\r\nThe same were the results where dogs were fed upon gum, and butter; when\r\nthey were fed with olive oil and water the phenomena were the same, with\r\nthe exception of ulceration of the cornea.\r\n\r\nIn Denmark, a diet of bread and water for a month is considered equivalent\r\nto the punishment of death. Dr. Stark died in consequence of experiments\r\nwhich he instituted on himself to ascertain the effects of a sugar diet.\r\n\r\nMuller has justly observed that these experiments of Magendie have thrown\r\nconsiderable light on the causes and the mode of treatment of the gout and\r\ncalculous disorders. The subjects of these diseases are generally persons\r\nwho live well and eat largely of animal food; most urinary calculi,\r\ngravelly deposits, the gouty concretions, and the perspiration of gouty\r\npersons, contain an abundance of uric acid, a substance in which nitrogen\r\nis contained in a large proportion. Thus, by diminishing the proportion of\r\nazotical substance in the food, the gout and gravelly deposits may be\r\nprevented.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Tiedemann and Gmelin have confirmed those of Magendie,\r\nwhose curious observations on the necessity of varying diet I shall\r\ntranscribe.\r\n\r\n1. A dog fed on white bread, wheat, and water, did not live more than\r\nfifty days.\r\n\r\n2. Another dog, who was kept on brown soldiers' bread did not suffer.\r\n\r\n3. Rabbits and guineapigs who were fed solely on any one of the following\r\nsubstances--oats, barley, cabbage, and carrots,--died of inanition in\r\nfifteen days; but they did not suffer when these substances were given\r\nsimultaneously or in succession.\r\n\r\n4. An ass fed on dry rice, and afterwards on boiled rice, lived only\r\nfifteen days; a cock, on the contrary, was fed with boiled rice for\r\nseveral months with no ill consequence.\r\n\r\n5. Dogs fed with cheese alone, or hard eggs, lived for a long time; but\r\nthey became feeble and lost their hair.\r\n\r\n6. Rodent animals will live a very long time on muscular substances.\r\n\r\n7. After an animal has been fed for a long period on one kind of aliment,\r\nwhich, if continued, will not support life, allowing it the former\r\ncustomary food will not save it: he will eat eagerly, but will die as soon\r\nas if he had continued to be restricted to the article of food which was\r\nfirst given him.\r\n\r\nDr. Paris is of opinion that all that these experiments tend to prove is,\r\nthat animals cannot exist upon highly-concentrated aliment. Horses fed on\r\nconcentrated aliment are liable to various disorders, originating from\r\ndiseased action of the stomach and liver, broken wind, staggers,\r\nblindness, &c.\r\n\r\nProfessor Muller has given an excellent definition of indigestion. \"It is\r\na state of the digestive organs in which either they do not secrete the\r\nfluid destined for the solution of the aliment, or they are in such a\r\ncondition of irritability or atony, that by the mechanical irritation of\r\nthe food, painful sensations and irregular motions are exerted.\"\r\n\r\nBut the most curious experiments made on the changes which the food\r\nundergoes in the stomach, according to the greater or lesser facility with\r\nwhich it is digested, were those of Dr. Beaumont. This physiologist had\r\nthe rare opportunity of investigating this subject in a patient of the\r\nname of St. Martin, who came under his care in consequence of a gun-shot\r\nwound, which left a considerable opening in the stomach, which, when\r\nempty, could be explored to the depth of five or six inches by artificial\r\ndistention. The food and the drink could in this manner be seen to enter\r\nit. This enabled him to keep an interesting journal and table, showing the\r\ntime required for the digestion of different kinds of food, which were\r\ntaken with bread or vegetables, or both. The following are some of his\r\ninteresting observations:\r\n\r\n_Experiment 33._ At 1 o'clock St. Martin dined on roast beef, bread, and\r\npotatoes--in half an hour examined the contents of the stomach, found what\r\nhe had eaten reduced to a mass resembling thick porridge. At 2 o'clock,\r\nnearly all chymified--a few distinct particles of food still to be seen.\r\nAt half-past four, chymification complete. At 6 o'clock nothing in the\r\nstomach but a little gastric juice tinged with bile.\r\n\r\n_Ex. 42._ At 8 a.m., breakfast of three hard-boiled eggs, pancakes, and\r\ncoffee. At half-past eight, found a heterogenous mixture of the articles\r\nslightly digested. At a quarter-past ten, no part of breakfast could be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n_Ex. 43._ At 2 o'clock same day, dined on roast pig and vegetables. At 3\r\nthey were chymified; and at half-past four nothing remained but a little\r\ngastric juice.\r\n\r\n_Ex. 18_, in a third series. At half-past eight a.m., two drams of fresh\r\nfried sausage, in a fine muslin bag, were suspended in the stomach of St.\r\nMartin, who immediately afterwards breakfasted on the same kind of\r\nsausage, and a piece of broiled mutton, wheaten bread, and a pint of\r\ncoffee. At half-past eleven, stomach half empty, contents of bag about\r\nhalf diminished. At 2 o'clock p.m., stomach empty and clean, contents of\r\nbag all gone with the exception of fifteen grains, consisting of small\r\npieces of cartilaginous and membranous fibres, and the spices of the\r\nsausage, which last weighed six grains.\r\n\r\nAs I have elsewhere observed, various are the theories that have been\r\nentertained in regard to digestion, but the experiments of Dr. Beaumont\r\nseem to have proved beyond a doubt, that this operation is due to the\r\naction of the gastric juice, with which he was enabled to produce\r\nartificial digestion. Having obtained one ounce of this solvent from the\r\nstomach of his patient, he put into it a solid piece of recently-boiled\r\nbeef, weighing three drams, and placed the vessel that contained it in a\r\nwater bath heated to 100 deg. In forty minutes digestion had commenced on\r\nthe surface of the meat; in fifty minutes, the fluid was quite opake and\r\ncloudy, the external texture began to separate and become loose; in sixty\r\nminutes, chyme began to form. At 1 p.m. (two hours after the commencement\r\nof the experiment), the cellular substance was destroyed, the muscular\r\nfibres loose and floating about in fine small threads very tender and\r\nsoft. In six hours they were nearly all digested--a few fibres only\r\nremaining. After the lapse of ten hours, every part of the meat was\r\ncompletely digested. The artificial digestion by these experiments appears\r\nto be but little slower than the natural process--they also demonstrate\r\nthe influence of the temperature, and the quantity of the solvent\r\nsecretion. Having obtained from St. Martin two ounces of gastric juice, he\r\ndivided this quantity into two equal portions, and laid in each an equal\r\nquantity of masticated roast beef. One he placed in a water bath at the\r\ntemperature of 99 deg. Farh.--and left the other exposed to the open air\r\nat the temperature of 34 deg.; a third similar portion of meat he kept in a\r\nphial, with an ounce of cold water. An hour after the commencement of the\r\nexperiment, St. Martin had finished his breakfast, which consisted of the\r\nsame meat with biscuit, butter, and coffee. Two hours after the meat had\r\nbeen put into the phial, the portion in the warm gastric juice was as far\r\nadvanced in chymification as the food in the stomach; the meat in the cold\r\ngastric juice was less acted on, and that in the cold water only slightly\r\nmacerated. In two hours and forty-five minutes from the time that the\r\nexperiment was begun, the food in the stomach was completely digested, the\r\nstomach empty, while even at the end of six hours the meat in the gastric\r\njuice was only half digested. Dr. Beaumont, therefore, having procured 12\r\ndrams of fresh gastric juice, added now a portion to each of the phials\r\ncontaining meat and gastric juice, and to a portion of the half-digested\r\nfood which he had withdrawn from the stomach two hours after the\r\ncommencement of the experiment, and which had not advanced towards\r\nsolution. After eight hours' maceration, the portions of meat in the cold\r\ngastric juice, and in the cold water, were little changed, but, from the\r\ntime of the addition of the fresh gastric juice, digestion went on rapidly\r\nin the other phials, which were kept at the proper heat, and at the end of\r\n24 hours, the meat which had been withdrawn from the stomach after\r\ndigestion had commenced, were, with the exception of a piece of meat that\r\nhad not been masticated, converted into a thickish pulpy mass of a\r\nreddish-brown colour: the meat in the warm gastric juice was also\r\ndigested, though less perfectly, while that in the cold gastric juice was\r\nscarcely more acted on than the meat in the water, which was merely\r\nmacerated. Dr. Beaumont now exposed these two phials containing the meat\r\nin cold gastric juice, and meat in water, to the heat of the water bath\r\nfor 24 hours, and the gastric juice, which when cold had no power on the\r\nmeat, now digested it; while the meat in the water underwent no change,\r\nexcept that towards the end of the experiment, putrefaction had commenced.\r\nThe antiseptic properties of the gastric juice were fully demonstrated in\r\nseveral other experiments.\r\n\r\nVarious philosophers, in idle disquisitions, have endeavoured by the most\r\nabsurd hypotheses to determine what is the natural food of man, and to\r\nshow that he is not created omnivorous. The comparison between our species\r\nand animals confutes these vain theories. The masticatory and digestive\r\norganization of man assigns to him an intermediate rank between\r\ncarnivorous and herbivorous creatures. The teeth may be said by their\r\nfigure and construction to bear a relation with our natural food. The\r\nteeth of flesh-eating animals rise in sharp prominences to seize and\r\nlacerate their prey, and those of the lower jaw shut within those of the\r\nsuperior one. The herbivorous animals are not armed with these formidable\r\nweapons, but have broad flat surfaces with intermixed plates of enamel,\r\nthat they should wear less rapidly in the constant labour of grinding and\r\ntriturating. In the carnivorous, the jaws can only move backward and\r\nforward; in the herbivorous their motion is lateral, as observed in the\r\ncow when chewing her cud. Beasts of prey tear and swallow their food in\r\nmasses, while in others it undergoes a careful communition before it is\r\ntransmitted to the stomach. The teeth of man only resemble those of\r\ncarnivorous animals by their enamel being confined to their external\r\nsurface, while in the freedom of the motion of the jaws from side to side\r\nthey partake of the conformation of the herbivorous. The teeth and jaws of\r\nman are in all respects more similar to those of monkeys than any other\r\nanimals; only in some of the simiae the canine teeth are much longer and\r\nstronger, and denote a carnivorous propensity.\r\n\r\nIt is to the abuse of this omnivorous faculty that Providence has bestowed\r\nupon mankind, that we owe many of the diseases under which our species\r\nlabours. \"Multos morbos, multa fercula fecerunt,\" sayeth Seneca; yet we\r\nare far more temperate in the present age than the ancients during the\r\nperiod of their boasted high civilization and prosperity. Their excesses\r\nmust have been of the most disgusting nature, since, to indulge more\r\neasily in their gluttonous propensities, they had recourse to emetics both\r\nbefore and after their meals. \"Vomunt ut edant, edunt ut vomunt, et epulas\r\nquas toto orbe conquirunt nec concoquere dignantur,\" was the reproach of\r\nthe above-quoted philosopher. Suetonius and Dion Cassius give Vitellius\r\nthe credit of having introduced this revolting custom into fashion; and\r\nsplendid vessels for the purpose were introduced in their feasts. Martial\r\nalludes to it in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  Nec coenat prius, aut recumbit, ante\r\n  Quam septem vomuit meri deunces.\r\n\r\nAnd Juvenal tells us that the bath was polluted by this incredible act of\r\nbestiality,--\r\n\r\n  Et crudum pavonem in balnea portas.\r\n\r\nThe sums expended by the ancients on their table exceed all belief.\r\nVitellius expended for that purpose upwards of 3200_l._ daily, and some of\r\nhis repasts cost 40,000_l._ At one of them, according to Suetonius, 7000\r\nbirds and 2000 fishes were served up. Aelius Verus laid out 600,000\r\nsestertii on one meal; and some of the dishes of Heliogabalus cost about\r\n4000_l._ of our money. The excesses of this monster were such, that\r\nHerodianus affirms that he wanted to ascertain, not only the flavour of\r\nhuman flesh, but of the most disgusting and nameless substances. The\r\nfreaks related of this emperor are scarcely credible; but his gastronomic\r\nprofusion may be easily conceived when we find that his very mats were\r\nmade with the down of hares or soft feathers found under the wings of\r\npartridges! When such ideas of _enjoyment_ prevailed, can we wonder that\r\nPhiloxenus should have wished that he had the throat of a crane, that he\r\nmight prolong the delights of eating!\r\n\r\nOur early ancestors were remarkable for their frugality, and it is\r\nsupposed that luxurious, or, at least, full living was introduced by the\r\nDanes: it has been even asserted that the verb _gormandize_ was derived\r\nfrom _Gormond_, a Danish king, who was persuaded by Alfred to be baptized.\r\nErasmus observed that the English were particularly fond of good fare.\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, and Rufus, were in the habit of giving most\r\nsplendid entertainments; and the former monarch was such an irascible\r\nepicure, that, upon one occasion, an underdone crane having been served up\r\nby the _master of the cury_, he would have knocked him down but for the\r\ntimely interference of his _dapifer_, or purveyor of the mouth. This\r\noffice of _dapifer_, with that of _lardrenius_, _magnus coquus_, _coquorum\r\nprepositus_, and _coquus regius_, were high dignitaries in those days.\r\nCardinal Otto, the pope's legate, being at Oxford in 1238, his brother was\r\nhis _magister coquorum_; and the reasons assigned for his holding that\r\noffice were his brother's suspicious fears \"_ne procuraretur aliquid\r\nvenenosum, quod valde timebat legatus_.\" These officers were not\r\nunfrequently clergymen, who were elevated to the bench for their valuable\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nWhatever barbarity the ancients may have shown in preparing their dainty\r\ndishes, none could have surpassed in refinement of cruelty. Their method\r\nof roasting and eating a goose alive, is thus directed: \"Take a goose or a\r\nduck, or some such _lively creature_, (but the goose is best of all for\r\nthe purpose,) pull off all her feathers, only the head and neck must be\r\nspared; then make a fire round about her, not too close to her, that the\r\nsmoke do not choke her, and that the fire may not burn her too soon, nor\r\ntoo far off, that she may not escape the fire; within the circle of the\r\nfire, let there be small cups and pots full of water, wherein salt and\r\nhoney are mingled, and let there be set also chargers full of sodden\r\napples, cut into small pieces in the dish. The goose must be all larded\r\nand basted over with butter, to make her the more fit to be eaten, and may\r\nroast the better. Put the fire about her but do not make too much haste,\r\nwhen as you see her begin to roast; for by walking about, and flying here\r\nand there, being cooped in by the fire that stops her way out, the\r\nunscared goose is kept in; she will fall to drink the water to quench her\r\nthirst and cool her heart, and all her body, and the apple sauce will\r\ncleanse and empty her, and when she wasteth, and consumes inwardly, always\r\nwet her head and heart with a wet sponge, and when you see her giddy with\r\nrunning and begin to stumble, her heart wants moisture, and she is roasted\r\nenough. Take her up and set her before your guest, and she will cry as you\r\ncut off any part from her, and will be almost eaten up before she is dead.\r\n_It is mighty pleasant_ to behold.\"\r\n\r\nOur forefathers were most ingenious in these diabolical fancies, we find\r\nin Portar's Magick the way how to persuade a goose to roast _herself_ if\r\nyou have a lack of cooks.\r\n\r\nThe heroic conduct of French cooks has been recorded in history, and\r\ncompared with the noble devotion of the ancients. Vatel, maitre d'hotel of\r\nLouis XIV., put an end to his wretched existence in consequence of fish\r\nnot having arrived in time for dinner. On this sad event being reported to\r\nhis sovereign, he both praised and blamed his courage; and, to use the\r\nwords of Madame de Sevigne, he perished \"a force d'avoir de l'honneur a sa\r\nmaniere; on loua fort et l'on blama son courage.\" It is strange that\r\nNapoleon should have used the very same expressions when speaking of one\r\nof his most distinguished generals. In more modern times we have heard of\r\npersons who expected that clerical functions should be combined with\r\nvarious lay duties, as appears by the following curious advertisement in a\r\nlate paper:\r\n\r\n\"Wanted, for a family who have bad health, a sober, steady person, in the\r\ncapacity of doctor, surgeon, apothecary, and man-midwife. He must\r\noccasionally act as butler, and dress hair and wigs. He will be required\r\nsometimes to read prayers, and to preach a sermon every Sunday. A good\r\nsalary will be given.\" This was certainly an economical speculation for\r\nthe use of soul and body.\r\n\r\nCooks have sometimes been obliged to resort to pious frauds; and it is\r\nrelated of our Richard Coeur de Lion, that, being very ill during the\r\nholy wars, he took a strange fancy for a bit of pork, but, as no pig could\r\nbe procured, a plump Saracen child was roasted as a substitute; and it was\r\nremarked that Richard was ever after partial to pork.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt but that our forefathers were harder livers than the\r\npresent generation: even within the memory of man, drinking to excess is a\r\nvice seldom observed, excepting in some individuals belonging to the old\r\nschool. The hours of refection have been singularly altered; and while our\r\nfashionable circles seldom sit down to table before eight o'clock in the\r\nevening, we find in olden chronicles that even royalty was used to dine at\r\nnine in the morning, more especially upon the Continent. In the Heptaemeron\r\nof the Queen of Navarre we find an account of the manner of spending the\r\nday:\r\n\r\n\"As soon as the morning rose, they went to the chamber of Madame Oysille,\r\nwhom they found already at her prayers; and when they had heard during a\r\ngood hour her lecture, and then the mass, they went to dine at ten\r\no'clock, and afterwards each privately retired to his room, but did not\r\nfail at noon to meet in the meadow. Vespers heard, they went to supper;\r\nand after having played a thousand sports in the meadow they retired to\r\nbed.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of Charles V. of France, the court dined at ten, supped\r\nat seven, and retired to rest at nine. Holinshed gives the following\r\ncurious description of our early diet: \"Our tables are oftentimes more\r\nplentifully garnished than those of other nations, and this trade has\r\ncontinued with us since the very beginning; for, before the Romans found\r\nout and knew the way into our country, our predecessors fed largely upon\r\nflesh and milk, whereof there was great abundance in this isle, because\r\nthey applied their chief studies unto pasturage and feeding.\r\n\r\n\"In Scotland, likewise, they have given themselves unto very ample and\r\nlarge diet, wherein as for some respect nature doth make them equal with\r\nus, so otherwise they far exceed us in over much and distemperate\r\ngormandize, and so engross their bodies, that divers of them do oft become\r\nunapt to any other purpose than to spend their time in large tabling and\r\nbelly cheer. In old times these North Britons did give themselves\r\nuniversally to great abstinence; and in time of war their soldiers would\r\noften feed but once, or twice at the most, in two or three days,\r\nespecially if they held themselves in secret, or could have no issue out\r\nof their bogs and morasses, through the presence of an enemy; and in this\r\ndistress they used to eat a certain kind of confection, whereof so much as\r\na bean would qualify their hunger above common expectation. In those days,\r\nalso, it was taken for a great offence over all to eat either goose, hare,\r\nor hen, because of a certain superstitious opinion which they had\r\nconceived of these three creatures. Amongst other things, baked meats,\r\ndishes never before this man's (James I.) days seen in Scotland, were\r\ngenerally so provided for by virtue of this act, that it was not lawful\r\nfor any to eat of the same under the degree of a gentleman, and those only\r\nbut on high and festival days. In number of dishes and changes of meat,\r\nthe nobility of England (whose cooks are for the most part musical-headed\r\nFrenchmen and strangers) do most exceed; sith there is no day in manner\r\nthat passeth over their heads, wherein they have not only beef, mutton,\r\nveal, lamb, kid, pork, cony, capon, pig, or so many of these as the season\r\nyieldeth, but also some portion of the red and fallow deer, beside great\r\nvariety of fish and wild fowl, and thereto sundry other delicates, wherein\r\nthe sweet hand of the seafaring Portingale is not wanting; so that for a\r\nman to dine with one of them, and to taste of every dish that standeth\r\nbefore him, is rather to yield unto a conspiracy, with a great deal of\r\nmeat for the speedy suppression of natural health, than the use of a\r\nnecessary mean to satisfy himself with a competent repast, to sustain his\r\nbody withal. The chief part, likewise, of their daily provision is brought\r\nin before them commonly in silver vessels, if they be of the degree of\r\nbarons, bishops, and upwards, and placed upon their tables; whereof when\r\nthey have taken what it pleaseth them, the rest is reserved, and\r\nafterwards sent down to their serving-men and waiters.\r\n\r\n\"The gentlemen and merchants keep much about one rate, and each of them\r\ncontenteth himself with four, five, or six dishes, when they have but\r\nsmall resort; or, peradventure, with one or two, or three at the most,\r\nwhen they have no strangers. And yet their servants have their ordinary\r\ndiet assigned, besides such as is left at their masters' boards, and not\r\nappointed to be brought thither the second time, which, nevertheless, is\r\noften seen, generally in venison, lamb, or some especial dish whereon the\r\nmerchantman himself liketh to feed when it is cold.\r\n\r\n\"At such times as the merchants do make their ordinary or voluntary\r\nfeasts, it is a world to see what great provision is made of all manner of\r\ndelicate meats from every quarter of the country, wherein, beside that\r\nthey are often comparable herein to the nobility of the land, they will\r\nseldom regard any thing that the butcher usually killeth, but reject the\r\nsame as not worthy to come in place. In such cases, also, _geliffes_ of\r\nall colours, mixed with a variety in the representation of sundry flowers,\r\nherbs, trees, forms of beasts, fish, fowls, and fruits; and thereunto\r\n_marchpane_ wrought with no small curiosity, tarts of divers hues and\r\nsundry denominations; conserves of old fruits, foreign and home-bred;\r\nsuckets, codiniacs, marmalades, sugar-bread, ginger-bread, florentines,\r\nwild-fowl, venison of all sorts, and sundry outlandish confections,\r\naltogether seasoned with sugar, (which Pliny calls _mel ex arundinibus_, a\r\ndevice not common nor greatly used in old times at the table, but only in\r\nmedicine, although it grew in Arabia, India, and Sicilia,) do generally\r\nbear the sway, besides infinite devices of our own not possible for me to\r\nremember. Of the potato, and such _venerous_ roots as are brought out of\r\nSpain, Portingale, and the Indies, to furnish our banquets, I speak not,\r\nwherein our _Mures_, of no less force, and to be had about Crosby\r\nRavenswath, do now begin to have place.\r\n\r\n\"And as all estates do exceed in strangeness and number of costly dishes,\r\nso these forget not to use the like excess in wine, insomuch as there is\r\nno kind to be had (neither any where more store of all sorts than in\r\nEngland, although we have none growing with us; but yearly the proportion\r\nof twenty or thirty thousand tun and upwards, notwithstanding the daily\r\nrestraints on the same brought over to us) whereof at great meetings there\r\nis not some store to be had. Neither do I mean this of small wines only,\r\nsuch as claret, white, red, French, &c. which amount to about fifty-six\r\nsorts, according to the number of regions from whence they come; but also\r\nof the thirty kinds of Italian, Grecian, Spanish, Canarian, &c., whereof\r\n_Vernage_, _Cate-pument_, _Raspis_, _Muscadell_, _Romnie_, _Bastard Fire_,\r\n_Osey_, _Caprike_, claret, and malmsey, are not least of all accounted of,\r\nbecause of their strength and value. For as I have said of meat, so, the\r\nstronger the wine is, the more it is desired, by means thereof in old\r\ntimes, the best was called _Theologicum_ because it was had from the\r\nclergy and religious men, unto whose houses many of the laity would often\r\nsend for bottles filled with the same, being sure that they would neither\r\ndrink nor be served of the worst, or such as was any ways mingled or\r\nbrewed by the vintner; nay, the merchant would have thought that his soul\r\nshould have gone straightways to the devil, if he should have served him\r\nwith any other than the best. Furthermore, when they have had their course\r\nwhich nature yieldeth, sundry sorts of artificial stuff, as _ypocras_ and\r\nwormwood wine, must in like manner succeed in turns, besides stale ale and\r\nstrong beer, which nevertheless bears the greatest brunt in drinking, and\r\nare of so many sorts and ages as it pleaseth the brewer to make.\r\n\r\n\"In feasting, the artisans do exceed after their manner, especially at\r\nbridals, purifications of women, and such like odd meetings, where it is\r\nincredible to tell what meat is consumed and spent; each one bringing such\r\na dish, or so many as his wife and he do consult upon, but always with\r\nthis consideration, that the _leefer_ (the more liberal) friend shall have\r\nthe best entertainment. This is also commonly seen at these banquets, that\r\nthe good man of the house is not charged with any thing, saving bread,\r\ndrink, house-room, and fire.\r\n\r\n\"Heretofore there hath been much more time spent in eating and drinking\r\nthan commonly is in these days; for whereas of old we had breakfasts in\r\nthe forenoon, _beverages_ or _nuntions_ after dinner, and thereto _rere\r\nsuppers_, generally when it was time to go to rest (a toy brought in by\r\nHard Canutus), now these odd repasts, thanked be God! are very well left,\r\nand each one in manner (except here and there some young hungry stomach\r\nthat cannot fast till dinner-time contenteth himself with dinner and\r\nsupper only). The Normans, disliking the gormandize of Canutus, ordained,\r\nafter their arrival, that no table should be covered above once in the\r\nday; which Huntingdon imputeth to their avarice: but, in the end, either\r\nwaxing weary of their own frugality, or suffering the cockle of old custom\r\nto overgrow the good corn of their new constitution, they fell to such\r\nliberty, that in often feeding they surmounted Canutus surnamed the Hardy;\r\nfor whereas he covered his table but three or four times in the day, they\r\nspread their cloths five or six times, and in such wise as I before\r\nrehearsed. They brought in also the custom of long and stately sitting at\r\nmeat, which is not yet left, although it be a great expense of time, and\r\nworthy reprehension; for the nobility and gentlemen, and merchantmen,\r\nespecially at great meetings, do sit commonly till two or three of the\r\nclock at afternoon, so that with many it is an hard matter to rise from\r\nthe table to go to evening prayer, and return from thence to come time\r\nenough to supper.\"\r\n\r\nThe early prevalence of drinking in England seems to have been derived\r\nfrom our foreign intercourse. In the reign of Elizabeth and James I. we\r\nfind various statutes against ebriety.\r\n\r\nTom Nash, in his \"Pierce Pennilesse\" says, \"Superfluity in drink is a sin\r\nthat ever since we have mixed ourselves with the Low Countries is counted\r\nhonourable; but, before we knew their lingering wars, was held in that\r\nhighest degree of hatred that might be. Then, if we had seen a man go\r\nwallowing in the streets, or lain sleeping under the board, we should have\r\nspit at him, and warned all our friends out of his company.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to our laws intoxication is looked upon as an aggravation of any\r\noffence. Sir Edward Coke calls a drunkard _voluntarius daemon_. The Romans\r\nthought differently: with them intoxication was often deemed an\r\nextenuation of guilt, \"Per vinum delapsis capitalis poena remittitur.\"\r\nThe Greeks, more severe, had a law of Pittacus that enacted the infliction\r\nof a double punishment on those who committed a crime when drunk.\r\n\r\nThat hard drinking was introduced from Flanders and Holland, and other\r\nnorthern countries, seems probable from the derivation of many of the\r\nexpressions used in carousing. The phrase of being \"half-seas over,\" as\r\napplied to a state of drunkenness, originated from _op zee_, which in\r\nDutch meant _over sea_; and Gifford informs us that it was a name given\r\nto a stupifying beer introduced in England from the Low Countries, and\r\ncalled _op zea_; thus Jonson in the Alchemist:\r\n\r\n  I do not like the dulness of your eye;\r\n  It hath a heavy cast, 'tis _up see Dutch_.\r\n\r\nAn inebriating draught was also called an _up see freeze_, from the strong\r\n_Friesland_ beer. The word \"carouse,\" according to Gifford and Blount, is\r\nderived from the name of a large glass, called by the Danes _ruuse_, or\r\nfrom the German words _gar_, _all_, and _ausz out_: hence drink _all out_.\r\n\r\nNash, in the work above quoted, says, \"Now he is nobody that cannot drink\r\n_super nagulum_, carouse the hunters' _hoope_, quaff _upsee freze crosse_,\r\nwith healths, gloves, mumpes, frolickes, and a thousand such domineering\r\ninventions.\" The origin of these slang terms is not quite evident.\r\nDrinking _super nagulum_, or on the nail, was a northern custom which\r\nconsisted in only leaving one drop in the cup, which was poured upon the\r\nthumb-nail, to prove that justice had been done to the potation or toast;\r\nand that, to use the language of modern drinkers, the glass was _cleared_.\r\nThis custom is alluded to by Bishop Hall in his \"Mundus alter et idem,\" in\r\nwhich the Duke of Tenderbelly exclaims, \"'Let never this goodly-formed\r\ngoblet of wine go jovially through me:' and then he set it to his mouth,\r\nstole it off every drop, save a little remainder, which he was by custom\r\nto set upon his thumb's nail and lick it off.\" In Fletcher we find the\r\nphrase\r\n\r\n  I am thine _ad unguem_;\r\n\r\nwhich meant he was ready to drink with him to this extent. The term _hoop_\r\nalludes to the marks of hoops being traced upon drinking-pots to point out\r\ncertain measures. Jack Cade says, \"The three-hooped pot shall have ten\r\nhoops, and I will make it felony to drink small beer!\" Hence probably the\r\ncommon saying of \"drinking deep,\" or to the last hoop. The _peg tankard_\r\nwas another measured vessel used in the jollifications of our forefathers,\r\nand is still to be found in some parts of England, more especially in\r\nDerbyshire. Pegge in his \"Anonymiana,\" thus describes them: \"They have in\r\nthe inside a row of eight pins, one above the other, from top to bottom;\r\nthe tankard holds two quarts, so that there is a gill of ale between each\r\npeg or pin. The first person who drank was to empty to the first peg, the\r\nsecond was to drink to the next, and so on; by which means the pegs were\r\nso many measures to the compotators, making them all drink alike or the\r\nsame quantity.\" In Archbishop Anselm's Canons made in the council at\r\nLondon in 1102, priests are enjoined not to go to drinking-bouts, nor to\r\n_drink pegs_: \"Ut presbyteri non eant ad potationes, nec ad _pinnas_\r\nbibant.\"\r\n\r\n_Gloves_, also called _shoeing-horns_, were relishes to encourage\r\ndrinking, like our modern _devils_, introduced for a similar purpose.\r\nBishop Hall says in his description of a carousal, \"Then comes me up a\r\nservice of _shoeing-horns_ of all sorts,--salt cakes, red-herrings,\r\nanchovies, and gammon of bacon, and abundance of such _pullers on_.\"\r\nMassinger thus describes these incentives:\r\n\r\n                                  I usher\r\n  Such an unexpected dainty bit for breakfast\r\n  As never yet I cooked; 'tis not _botargo_,\r\n  Fried frogs, potatoes marrow'd, cavear,\r\n  Carps' tongues, the pith of an English chine of beef,\r\n  Nor our Italian delicate oil'd mushrooms,\r\n  And yet a _drawer on too_; and if you show not\r\n  An appetite, and a strong one, I'll not say\r\n  To eat it, but devour it, without grace too,\r\n  (For it will not stay a preface,) I am shamed,\r\n  And all my past provocatives will be jeer'd at.\r\n\r\nThe _botargo_ was a relish made of mullet's roes, and highly seasoned,\r\nmuch in use among the Italians.\r\n\r\nAmongst many other curious frolics of hard drinkers, we find the use of\r\nwhat they called _flap-dragons_, or _snap-dragon_, which consisted in\r\nigniting combustible substances, which were swallowed while floating on\r\nthe glass of liquor. Johnson describes them \"a play in which they catch\r\nraisins out of burning brandy, and, extinguishing them by closing the\r\nmouth, eat them.\" This prank is not uncommon to the present day in\r\nboarding-schools in certain festive entertainments of the _young ladies_.\r\n\r\nDrunkenness being considered a beastly propensity, its gradations were\r\nfixed by animal comparisons. In a curious treatise on drunkards by George\r\nGascoigne, we find the following illustration of these degrees: \"The first\r\nis _ape-drunk_, and he leaps and sings and hallos and danceth for the\r\nhearers; the second is _lion-drunk_, and he flings the pots about the\r\nhouse, calls the hostess w----, breaks the glass windows with his dagger,\r\nand is apt to quarrel with any man that speaks to him; the third is\r\n_swine-drunk_, heavy, lumpish, and sleepy, and cries for a little more\r\ndrink and a few more clothes; the fourth is _sheep-drunk_, wise in his own\r\nconceit, when he cannot bring forth a right word; the fifth is\r\n_maudlin-drunk_, when a fellow will weep for kindness in the midst of his\r\ndrink, and kiss you, saying, 'By G--! Captain, I love thee! Go thy ways;\r\nthou dost not think so often of me as I do of you; I would I could not\r\nlove thee so well as I do!' and then he puts his finger in his eye and\r\ncries; the sixth is _martin-drunk_, when a man is drunk, and drinks\r\nhimself sober ere he stir; the seventh is _goat-drunk_, when in\r\ndrunkenness he hath no mind but in lechery; the eighth is _fox-drunk_,\r\nwhen he is crafty drunk, as many of the Dutchmen be, which will never\r\nbargain but when they are drunk. All these species, and more, I have seen\r\npractised _in one company at one sitting_.\"\r\n\r\nDrunkenness has at various periods been resorted to in religious and\r\npolitical fervour. Daring the usurpation of Cromwell, the Cavaliers were\r\nwont to drink their king's health in bumpers of wine in which some crumbs\r\nof bread had been thrown, exclaiming, \"God send this _crum-well_ down!\"\r\nand Whitelocke, in his Memorials, records the following barbarous\r\nCatilinian orgies: \"Five drunkards agree to drink the king's health in\r\ntheir blood, and that each of them should cut out a piece of his buttock,\r\nand fry it upon the gridiron, which was done by four of them, of whom one\r\ndid bleed so exceedingly that they were fain to send for a chirurgeon, and\r\nso were discovered. The wife of one of them, hearing that her husband was\r\namongst them, came to the room, and, taking up a pair of tongs, laid about\r\nher, and so saved the cutting of her husband's flesh.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws enacted to prevent drunkenness at various periods and by\r\ndifferent governments, are curious. Domitian ordered all the vine-plants\r\nin the Roman territory to be rooted out. Charles IX. of France issued a\r\nsimilar edict. In 1536, under Francis I, a law was passed sentencing\r\ndrunkards to imprisonment on bread and water for the first offence; a\r\npublic whipping punished a second infringement; and, on reiteration,\r\nbanishment and the loss of ears. The ancients, equally aware of the danger\r\nthat arose from intoxication, were also anxious to prevent it. Draco\r\ninflicted capital punishments. Lycurgus destroyed the vineyards. The\r\nAthenians had officers, named _ophthalmos_, to prevent excesses in liquor\r\ndrinking. In Rome, patricians were not allowed the use of wine until they\r\nhad attained their thirty-fifth year. Wine was only drunk pure in the\r\nbeginning of sober repasts in honour of _Deus Sospes_, and afterwards\r\nmixed with water in honour of _Jupiter Servator_. Notwithstanding these\r\nwise examples in support of prudent precepts, it appears that drunkenness\r\nwas a common vice amongst the Romans. Tiberius was surnamed _Biberius_;\r\nand it was said of the parasite Bibulus, \"dum vixit, aut bibit aut\r\nminxit.\" Aurelianus had officers of his household whose duty was to\r\nintoxicate foreign ambassadors; and Cato's partiality for the juice of the\r\ngrape has been recorded by Horace,\r\n\r\n  Narratur et prisci Catonis\r\n  Saepe mero caluisse virtus.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, drinking was resorted to by the monks as a religious\r\nlibation; and they also drank to the dead, a custom which was condemned as\r\nidolatrous. These excesses were restrained by various regulations, and in\r\n817 the quantity of wine allowed each monk was fixed at five pints.\r\nCharlemagne, in his Capitularies, forbids the provocation of drinking\r\nhealths and hob-nobbing (_pleger et trinquer_). Temperance societies are\r\nnot modern institutions. In 1517, Sigismund de Dietrichstein established\r\none under the auspices of St. Christopher; a similar association was\r\nformed in 1600 by Maurice Duke of Hesse, which, however, allowed a knight\r\nto drink seven _bocaux_, or glasses, at each meal, but only twice in the\r\nday. The size of these _bocaux_ is not recorded, but no doubt it was an\r\nendeavour to obtain a comparative condition of sobriety. Another temperate\r\nsociety, under the name of the Golden Ring, was instituted by Frederic V.\r\nCount Palatine.\r\n\r\nWhether the influence of temperate societies or their advocates will tend\r\nto diminish the consumption of wine and spirituous liquors in the British\r\nempire, it is difficult to say. Hitherto every act of interference, either\r\nfrom individuals or on the part of the legislature, has proved not only\r\nabortive, but has increased the evil it was intended to remedy. The\r\nimposition of heavy duties only threw the distillation of spirits into the\r\nhands of illicit speculators instead of respectable capitalists; and, as\r\nM'Culloch justly remarks, \"superadded the atrocities of the smuggler to\r\nthe idleness and dissipation of the drunkard.\" During the latter part of\r\nthe reign of George I. and the earlier period of George II. gin-drinking\r\nwas so prevalent, that it was denounced from the pulpit and the press. At\r\nlength ministers determined to make a vigorous effort to put a stop to the\r\nfurther use of spirituous liquors except as a cordial or medicine. To\r\naccomplish this end, a duty of twenty shillings was laid on spirits,\r\nexclusive of a heavy licence duty to retailers, while a fine of 100_l._\r\nwas levied on all defaulters. But instead of the anticipated effects,\r\nthis act produced results directly opposite: the respectable dealers\r\nwithdrew from a trade proscribed by the legislature; and the sale of\r\nspirits fell into the hands of the lowest and most profligate characters.\r\nThe officers of the revenue were hunted down by the populace, and did not\r\ndare to enforce the law; and Tindal, in his Continuation of Rapin, says,\r\n\"within two years of the passing of this act, it had become so odious and\r\ncontemptible, that policy as well as humanity forced the commissioners of\r\nexcise to mitigate its penalties.\" During these two years twelve thousand\r\npersons were convicted of offences connected with the sale of spirits,\r\nwhile no exertion could check the torrent of smuggling, and seven millions\r\nof gallons illicitly distilled were annually consumed in London and its\r\nenvirons. Our present consumption of British, Colonial and Foreign spirits\r\nis immense, but not equal to what it was at the period alluded to. The\r\nfollowing is the account of this consumption in 1832:\r\n\r\n  In England,  1,530,988 imperial gallons, Foreign.\r\n               3,377,507        \"          Colonial.\r\n               7,259,287        \"          British.\r\n  In Scotland,    69,236     gallons,      Foreign.\r\n                 112,026        \"          Colonial.\r\n               5,407,097        \"          British.\r\n  In Ireland,     33,413        \"          Foreign.\r\n                  24,432        \"          Colonial.\r\n               8,657,756        \"          British.\r\n\r\nIn that year, 1832, the total amount of spirits that paid duty in the\r\nUnited Kingdom was 2,646,258 gallons, yielding a revenue of 8,483,247_l._\r\nIn the same year the appearance and dread of the cholera produced a\r\nsingular increase in the consumption of brandy. In the preceding year,\r\n1831, the entries for home use in England had amounted to 1,194,717\r\ngallons; but during this state of alarm, it increased to 1,508,924; in\r\n1833, the danger having subsided, the consumption declined to its former\r\nlevel, and did not exceed 1,356,620 gallons.\r\n\r\nFrom the above observations it may be inferred, that no penal enactments,\r\nno denunciations of canting senators or fanatic preachers, will ever\r\nsucceed in checking the evils which must arise from excesses in the use of\r\nspirituous liquors. Gluttony and drunkenness can only be combated by the\r\nsalutary effects of good example held out by the superior classes of\r\nsociety; by a gradual improvement in the moral education of the lower\r\ngrades, for whom salutary amusements should be procured when a cheerful\r\nrepose from their weekly labour will no longer be considered a breach of\r\nthe sabbath. Diffusion of knowledge and habits of industry will do more\r\nthan sanctimonious admonitions, and the Penny Magazines may be considered\r\nmore hostile to gin-drinking than the ranting of pseudo-saints.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the quantity that we should eat, no rules can be established,\r\nas individuals differ widely from each other, both as to their capacity\r\nand their inclination. Mr. Abernethy maintained, that it would be well if\r\nthe public would follow the advice of Mr. Addison, given in the Spectator,\r\nof reading the writings of L. Cornaro, who, having a weak constitution,\r\nwhich he seemed to have ruined by intemperance, so that he was expected to\r\ndie at the age of 32, did at that period adopt a strict regimen, allowing\r\nhimself only 12 ounces daily. To this remark Dr. Paris very properly\r\nobserves, \"When I see the habits of Cornaro so incessantly introduced as\r\nan example for imitation, and as the standard of dietetic perfection, I am\r\nreally inclined to ask with Feggio, 'Did God create Lewis Cornaro to be a\r\nrule for all mankind in what they were to eat and drink?'\"\r\n\r\nIn regard to the dyspeptic, Dr. Philips has given the very best advice in\r\nthe following paragraph:\r\n\r\n\"The dyspeptic should carefully attend to the first feeling of satiety.\r\nThere is a moment when the relish given by the appetite ceases; a single\r\nmouthful taken after this oppresses a weak stomach. If he eats slowly and\r\ncarefully attends to this feeling, he will never overload the stomach.\" To\r\nthis Dr. Paris adds, \"Let him remember to _eat slowly_.\" \"This is an\r\nimportant condition--for when we eat too fast we introduce a greater\r\nquantity of food into the stomach than the gastric juice can at once\r\ncombat with; the consequence of which is, that hunger may continue for\r\nsome time after the stomach has received more than would be sufficient,\r\nunder the circumstances, to induce satiety.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of French cookery in every part of England amongst the\r\nwealthy will render attention to dietetic rules still more important than\r\nin former days; although Dean Swift, in his time, observed, \"That modern\r\nepicurism had become so prevalent, that the world must be encompassed,\r\nbefore a washerwoman can sit down to breakfast.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF IMAGINATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nInnumerable are the diseases that arise from our busy fancy. We are all\r\nsubject to the tyrannic sway of imagination's empire. Under this mighty\r\ninfluence man displays energies which lead him boldly to dare danger and\r\ncomplicated sufferings, or he is reduced to the most degraded state of\r\nmiserable despondency. These diseases are the more fearful, since they\r\nrarely yield to physical aid, and it is seldom that moral influence is\r\nsufficiently persuasive to combat their inveteracy. It is idle to tell the\r\ntimid hypochondriac that he is not ill; the mere circumstance of his\r\nbelieving himself sick, constitutes a serious disorder. His constant\r\napprehensions derange his functions until an organic affection arises. The\r\npatient who fancies that he labours under an affection of the heart\r\ndisturbs the circulation, which is ever influenced by our moral emotions,\r\ntill at last this disturbance occasions the very malady which he dreaded.\r\nThese aberrations of the mind arise from various causes,--mental emotions,\r\nconstitution, climate, diet, hereditary disposition, education. Tertullian\r\ncalled philosophy and medicine twin sisters; both may become powerful\r\nagents in controlling our imagination.\r\n\r\nThe ancients have variously endeavoured to determine the seat of this\r\nfaculty. Aristotle placed it in the heart, which, from the sense of its\r\noppression observed in acute moral sufferings he considered the origin of\r\nour nerves, or sensorium. Avicenus and other philosophers located\r\nimagination in the anterior portion of the brain, which he called the\r\n_prow_; memory in the posterior part, which he denominated the _poop_, and\r\njudgment in the centre of the organ, or what mariners would term\r\n_mid-ship_. The notions of Gall and Spurzheim had long since been\r\nanticipated by philosophers and physicians, both in regard to the division\r\nof the cerebral organ, and the external appearance of the cranium, which\r\ndenoted their preponderancy. That temperature exercises a powerful\r\ninfluence over our mental faculties is evident. In warm climates we find a\r\ngreater exaltation of the mind, more enthusiasm and vivid emotion, than in\r\nnorthern latitudes. The East is the land of fancy, illustrated by their\r\nwondrous tales of fiction, and their vivid and fantastic imagery,\r\ndisplayed in the chimeras and the arabesques of their palaces and temples.\r\nIn these regions all the passions are uncontrollable and wild. Love is\r\ncharacterized by furious or dark jealousy, according to the rank and\r\npower of the lover; and ambition is signalized by bloodthirsty and\r\npromiscuous barbarity. No opposition can be brooked: man is either a\r\nferocious tyrant, or an abject slave; subjection alone preventing the\r\noppressed from being as sanguinary as the oppressor. Government is\r\ndespotism, and religion fatality and fanaticism. In northern climes, on\r\nthe contrary, every thing is cold and calculating. The almighty passion of\r\nlove may prevail; but its demonstrations are morose, concentrated,\r\nalthough not less ferocious than under a southern sky. In the one country,\r\nman seeks the dark shelter of the forest, and the solitude of the\r\nmountain, to ponder over his grievances, or soliloquise on his sufferings;\r\nin the other he courts the roseate bower and the orange grove, to lull him\r\ninto a soft repose which may calm his feelings by temporary oblivion, to\r\nbe roused again to action by the stimulus of opium, tobacco, and a burning\r\nsun. The ancients were so fully convinced of this influence of the\r\namorphous constitution, that Lucianus tells us that the Abderites (a\r\npeople so remarkable for their stupidity and sluggishness that _Abderitica\r\nmens_ was proverbial), having witnessed the performance of one of\r\nEuripides's plays under the fierce solar rays, became fired with such\r\nenthusiasm, that they ran about the streets in a wild phrensy, repeating\r\naloud his sublime verses, until the coolness of the evening restored them\r\nto reason and to their native torpor. So predominant are these feelings,\r\nwhich owe their character to climate, that they regulate our ideas of a\r\nfuture state, as well as our conduct on earth. The paradise of the\r\nMohammedan is a blessed region of everlasting pleasure and sensual\r\nenjoyments; beauteous houris await the soul, which is to luxuriate in\r\ncorporeal voluptuousness; and the purple wine, forbidden to the living, is\r\nto flow in delectable streams, to delight the dead, who may, in the\r\nseventh paradise inhabit a land where rivers of wine, and milk, and honey,\r\nare ever flowing; where evergreen trees bend under luxurious fruits, whose\r\nvery pips are transformed into lovely maidens, so sweet--to use their own\r\nmetaphorical language--that the ocean would lose its bitterness if they\r\ndid but condescend to spit in its briny waters; and all these enjoyments\r\nare secured to the true believer by hosts of guardian angels, who have\r\nseventy thousand mouths, and seventy thousand tongues, to praise God\r\nseventy thousand times each day in seventy thousand languages: and such is\r\ntheir horror of earthly heat, that in the other world one of the greatest\r\nrewards is the delight of being able to sleep under the cool shade of a\r\ntree each leaf of which is of such an expanse that a man might travel\r\nfifty thousand years under its benign protection. How different is the\r\nparadise of Odin! There, it is true, the soul of the departed dwells in\r\nmagnificent palaces; but what are his enjoyments compared to those of the\r\nsensual Asiatic! Instead of soft music, the din of war is constantly to\r\nresound in his ear, while he luxuriates in drinking strong beer and\r\nhydromel, poured by the fair Valknas, the houris of the Vahalla paradise,\r\ninto the skulls of his enemies. Their God is called the god of crows; and\r\ntwo of these sable familiars, _Hugin_, who represents the mind, and\r\n_Nunnin_, or memory, are constantly perched upon his shoulders, until they\r\ntake flight to seek information for their master.\r\n\r\nTo this day it is said that the Tartars fancy, that, in their future abode\r\nof bliss, their reward will be a sort of Platonic affection, and a\r\nperpetual and undisturbed state of meditation; in short, a celestial _far\r\nniente_. So convinced were the ancients of this effect of peculiar\r\ntemperature, that the morose Heraclitus maintained that the power of the\r\nmind arose from a _dry splendour_; that all things were created by solar\r\nheat; and when ill himself, he sought health by endeavouring to dispel\r\nwatery accumulations by the heat of a dunghill. Ptolemy and Posidonius\r\nassert, that southern climes engender genius and wit, and are better\r\ncalculated for the study of things divine; and Plato, Hippocrates, and\r\nGalen, on the same principle, affirm that stupidity and forgetfulness are\r\nproduced by cold and humidity. The celebrated Descartes, in his younger\r\ndays, states that he felt his enthusiasm moderated by the damps and cold\r\nof Holland; and that he ever experienced more facility in pursuing his\r\nphilosophic studies in winter than in summer. Poets, on the contrary,\r\ncourt the glowing rays of an inspiring sun, and their Phoebus and their\r\nApollo is the conductor and the inspirer of the Muses:\r\n\r\n  Cynthius aurem vellit et admonuit.\r\n\r\nThat the energies of our intellectual faculties are under the influence of\r\nour food, is a fact long since observed. The stupidity of the athletae, who\r\nlived upon coarse bread (coliphium) and underdone meat, was proverbial;\r\neven Hercules laboured under the imputation of a mind somewhat obtuse. Our\r\ngenius, our energies are all affected by our mode of living. The rule of\r\n_Sanis omnia sana_, of Celsus, is applicable to very few individuals; and\r\nall our faculties may be rendered more keen or less vivid by temperance or\r\nexcesses. As the nature of our _ingesta_ influences the functions of our\r\ndigestive organs, so do these organs in their turn influence our moral\r\npowers when our physical energies are elevated or depressed. Our courage,\r\nour strength of mind, our religious and our moral train of thinking, are\r\nunder the control of diet. Fasting has ever been considered as\r\npredisposing to meditation and ascetic contemplation. Tertullian tells us,\r\nthat we should approach the altars fasting, or having eaten nothing but\r\ndry substances. All the religious ceremonies of the Egyptians were\r\npreceded by abstinence, and their sacrificators were allowed neither\r\nanimal food nor wine. Indeed, the Egyptian priesthood were remarkable for\r\ntheir abstinence and self-denial, fearful, according to Plutarch, that\r\n\"the body should not sit light upon the soul.\" Similar precautions were\r\nobserved with animals, and the ox apis was not allowed to drink the waters\r\nof the Nile, as they were considered of a gross and fattening nature; even\r\nupon festive days they observed a similar moderation. It was customary, on\r\nthe 9th day of the month Thoth, for every one to eat fried fish at their\r\ndoors--the priests only conformed to the custom by burning theirs at the\r\nappointed time. In general they abstained from most sorts of pulse,\r\nespecially beans and lentils, onions, garlic, leeks, mutton, pork; and on\r\ncertain days of purification, even salt was forbidden. Many of their fasts\r\nlasted from seven to forty-two days, during which time they abstained\r\nentirely from animal food, from herbs and vegetables, and the indulgence\r\nof any passion. Similar privations were observed by all those who attended\r\nthe mysteries of Juno and Ceres. In Holy Writ we find that it was after\r\nabstinence that Divine inspiration illumined the elect. The angel appeared\r\nunto Daniel after he had been three weeks without tasting flesh, or wine,\r\nor \"pleasant bread.\" In the Acts, x., we find that the vision appeared to\r\nPeter, \"when he had become hungry and would have eaten.\" Moses fasted\r\nforty days on Mount Sinai. We find in Jonah, that even cattle were\r\nfrequently subject to this mortification, when he proclaimed in Nineveh\r\nthat neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, should taste any thing; \"let\r\nthem not feed nor drink water.\" Congius Ripensis tells us, that the same\r\nrestriction was imposed by the Lacedaemonians on their Helots and all\r\ndomestic animals. Fasting was considered by the early Christians as an\r\nessential rite. St. Anthony prescribed to his disciples one meal of dry\r\nbread, salt and water, in the day without any food on Wednesdays and\r\nFridays. In the monastery of Mocham, in Egypt, a monk of the name of Jonas\r\nwas beatified for having lived until the age of eighty-five, working hard\r\nin the garden, and without any other food than raw herbs and grass steeped\r\nin vinegar; this abstemious cenobite added to his claims to canonization\r\nby always sleeping in his chair. St. Hilarius only ate fifteen figs and\r\nsix ounces of barley bread _per diem_. St. Julian Sabus retired to a\r\ncavern, where he only luxuriated once in the week on millet-bread, with\r\nsalt and water; and St. Macarius resolved to outdo him by restraining his\r\nsustenance to a few cabbage-leaves every Sunday. Not only did these\r\ngastric martyrs attribute their holy visions to abstinence, but they\r\nconsidered it as the source of their longevity. Thus, St. Anthony lived to\r\nthe age of one hundred and five; St. Paphinus to ninety on dry bread; and\r\nSt. Paul the Hermit thrived for one hundred and fifty-nine years upon\r\ndates. It is not derogatory to their supposed divine mission to say that\r\nall these men were as enthusiastic as the fakirs of the east.\r\n\r\nSo acceptable to the Deity was starvation considered, that at various\r\nperiods it was enforced by penal laws. Charlemagne denounces the\r\npunishment of death on all those who transgressed in this respect; and, by\r\nan old Polish edict, any sinner who ate on a fast-day was sentenced to\r\nhave all his teeth drawn. However, monkish ingenuity endeavoured to elude\r\nthese severe enactments, by interpreting the letter instead of the spirit;\r\nand we find, in the regulations of a German monastery, the following\r\naccommodation, \"_Liquidum non frangit jejunium_,\" by which, on days of\r\npenance, the monks only took rich soups and succulent broth. In latter\r\ndays, being permitted to eat fish in Lent, they saw no reason why fowl\r\nshould not be included, on the authority of Genesis, that the waters\r\nbrought forth every winged fowl after his kind. This relaxation in\r\nculinary discipline called forth loud indignation from many prelates. St.\r\nAmbrosius attributes the profligacy of the monks to these excesses; and\r\nTertullian considers the fall of the Israelites as the punishment of their\r\nneglect in this respect. Our Shakspeare illustrates this belief in the\r\ninfluence of fasting as preparatory to inspiration.\r\n\r\n  Last night the very gods shew'd me a vision--\r\n  I _fast_ and pray'd for their intelligence.\r\n\r\nNot satisfied with this mystification in food, we find some austere monks\r\nendeavouring to reduce carnal appetites by other means, such as by\r\nblood-letting, _monialem minuere_; and claustral flesh was brought down by\r\nphlebotomy and purging at regular periods. To this day we find that\r\nwell-behaved Turks, during the Ramasan, make it a godly point never to\r\nswallow their saliva.\r\n\r\nThis digression on fasting was somewhat necessary, to show how much our\r\ndiet tends to modify our being. It is well known that troops will display\r\nmore activity and courage when fasting than after a meal; and an ingenious\r\nphysician of our day is perfectly correct when he attributes a daring\r\nspirit or a pusillanimous feeling to the influence of our stomach.\r\n\r\nIntellectual weakness, frequently brought on by excesses, has proved a\r\nrich source to empiricism; hence the belief in mystic and supernatural\r\nagencies, and the power of certain nostrums. Coloured fountain water and\r\nbread pills have made the fortune of various quacks, when imaginary cures\r\nhave relieved imaginary diseases. In our days, numerous have been the\r\nrecoveries attributed to Hohenloe's prayers. Trusting to mystic numbers,\r\nthree, five, seven, or nine pills have produced effects, when other\r\nnumbers less fortunate would have failed. To this hour mankind, even in\r\nenlightened nations, are fettered by these absurd trammels. Credulity, and\r\nsuperstition her twin sister, have in all ages been the source whence\r\npriestcraft, and quackery have derived their wealth. Next to these rich\r\nmines we may rank fashion. The adoption of any particular medicine by\r\nprinces and nobles will endow it with as great a power as that which was\r\nsupposed to be vested in regal hands in the cure of scrofula, hence called\r\n_king's evil_; and we have too many instances of such cures having been\r\neffected by a monarch's touch to doubt the fact. The history of the potato\r\nis a strong illustration of the influence of authority: for more than two\r\ncenturies the use of this invaluable plant was vehemently opposed; at\r\nlast, Louis XV. wore a bunch of its flowers in the midst of his courtiers,\r\nand the consumption of the root became universal in France. The warm bath,\r\nso highly valued by the Romans, once fell into disrepute, because the\r\nEmperor Augustus had been cured by a cold one, which for a time was\r\ninvariably resorted to. Thus Horace exclaims,\r\n\r\n  ----Caput ac stomachum supponere fontibus audent\r\n  Clusinis, Gabiosque petunt et frigida rura.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the means which had relieved Augustus killed his nephew\r\nMarcellus; and the _Laconicum_ and the _Tepidarium_ were again crowded\r\nwith the \"fashion.\"\r\n\r\nPersecution and its prohibitions have also been most powerful in working\r\nupon our imagination. Rare and forbidden fruits will always be considered\r\nmore desirable than those we can easily obtain. The history of tobacco is\r\na striking instance of this influence of difficulty upon the mind of man.\r\nPope Urban VIII. prohibited its use in any shape, under the penalty of\r\nexcommunication. It was afterwards forbidden in Russia, under the pain of\r\nhaving the offender's nose cut off. In some cantons of Switzerland the\r\nprohibition was introduced in the decalogue, next to the commandment\r\nagainst adultery. Amurath IV. ordered all persons taken in _flagranti\r\ndelicto_ smoking tobacco, to be impaled, on the principle that its use\r\nchecked the progress of population. The denunciation of our James I. may\r\nbe considered as a masterpiece of the imaginary horrors attributed to this\r\nobnoxious weed. \"It is,\" he says, \"a custome loathsome to the eye,\r\nhatefull to the nose, harmefull to the braine, dangerous to the lungs, and\r\nin the black stinking fume thereof neerest resembling the horrible Stygian\r\nsmoake of the pit that is bottomlesse.\" During the reign of this monarch\r\nsuch a restriction might have been necessary, unless the consumption of\r\ntobacco enriched the exchequer: for it appears that some _amateurs_\r\nconsumed no less than L500 per annum in smoke. Surely we should reap some\r\nflourishing revenue from fashion and credulity, when we find our\r\ngovernment awarding L5000 to a _certain_ Johanna Stephens for her\r\ndiscovery of _certain_ medicines for the cure of _calculi_! The same\r\nimaginary hope induced many a credulous creature to minister to the\r\nnecessities of another Johanna, for _certain_ expectations. Alas! how this\r\nindefinite _sense_ exhibits the infinite folly of poor humanity!\r\n\r\nA morbid imagination, although frequently the source of much misery, will\r\nprove in many cases the fountain-head of many noble qualities; its\r\nexaltation constitutes genius, which is, in fact, a natural disposition of\r\nindividual organization sometimes bordering upon insanity. \"_Non est\r\nmagnum ingenium sine mixtura dementiae_,\" says Seneca; and Montaigne\r\nobserves, \"De quoi se fait la plus subtile folie que de la plus subtile\r\nsagesse? il n'y a qu'un demi-tour a passer de l'une a l'autre.\" Aristotle\r\nasserts that all the great men of his time were melancholy and\r\nhypochondriac. The ancient and eastern nations entertained a singular idea\r\nregarding men of innate genius, and possessed of more than common\r\nattributes; they fancied that they were the first-born, and the offsprings\r\nof illicit love: Zoroaster, Confucius, Mahomet, Vishnou, were born of\r\nvirgins; and Theseus, Hercules, Castor and Pollux, and Romulus, were all\r\nillegitimate.\r\n\r\nSo prone is a lively imagination to a derangement of the intellectual\r\nharmony, that the greatest care should be taken during the youthful\r\ndevelopment to resort to a sound and proper exercise. The constant\r\ntendency to wild and supernatural visions, the disregard of every daily\r\nand vulgar matter of fact consideration, soaring in regions of fiction,\r\nshould engage our incessant vigilance, such a state of mind, as\r\nAbercrombie justly observes, \"tends in a most material manner to prevent\r\nthe due exercise of those nobler powers which are directed towards the\r\ncultivation both of science and of virtue,\" and Foster has thus\r\nbeautifully illustrated this subject in his essays.\r\n\r\n\"The influence of this habit of dwelling on the beautiful fallacious forms\r\nof imagination, will accompany the mind into the most serious speculations\r\nor rather musings, on the real world, and what is to be done in it and\r\nexpected; as the image which the eye acquires from looking at any dazzling\r\nobject, still appears before it wherever it turns. The vulgar materials,\r\nthat constitute the actual economy of the world, will rise up to its sight\r\nin fictitious forms, which it cannot disenchant into plain reality, nor\r\nwill ever suspect to be deceptive. It cannot go about with sober, rational\r\ninspection and ascertain the nature and value of all things around it--in\r\nthat paradise it walks delighted, till some imperious circumstance of real\r\nlife call it thence, and gladly escapes thither again when the avocation\r\nis past. If a tenth part of the felicities that have been enjoyed, the\r\ngreat actions that have been performed, the beneficial institutions that\r\nhave been established, and the beautiful objects that have been seen in\r\nthat happy region, could have been imported into this terrestial\r\nplace!--what a delightful thing the world would have been to awake each\r\nmorning to see such a world once more!\"\r\n\r\nOf the miseries the hypochondriacs experience the following extract of a\r\nletter to a physician will afford a specimen: \"My poor body is a burning\r\nfurnace, my nerves red-hot coals, my blood is boiling oil; all sleep has\r\nfled, and I am suffering martyrdom. I am in agony when I lie on my back; I\r\ncannot lie on either side; and I endure excruciating torture when I seek\r\nrelief by lying on my stomach; and, to add to my misery, I can neither\r\nsit, stand, nor walk.\" The fancies of hypochondriacs are frequently of the\r\nmost extraordinary nature: one patient imagines that he is in such a state\r\nof obesity as to prevent his passing through the door of his chamber or\r\nhis house; another impressed with the idea that he is made of glass, will\r\nnot sit down for fear of cracking; a third seems convinced that his head\r\nis empty; and an intelligent American, holding a high judicial seat in our\r\nWest Indian colonies, could not divest himself of the occasional\r\nconviction of his being transformed into a turtle.\r\n\r\nThe most melancholy record of the miseries of hypochondriacism is to be\r\nfound in the diary of Dr. Walderstein of Gottingen. He was a man much\r\ndeformed in person, and his mind seemed as distorted as his body. Although\r\nof deep learning and research, and convinced of the absurdity of his\r\nimpressions, yet he was unable to resist their baneful influence. \"My\r\nmisfortune,\" says the doctor, \"is, that I never exist in this world, but\r\nrather in possible combinations created by my imagination to my\r\nconscience. They occupy a large portion of my time, and my reason has not\r\nthe power to banish them. My malady, in fact, is the faculty of extracting\r\npoison from every circumstance in life; so much so that I often felt the\r\nmost wretched being because I had not been able to sneeze three times\r\ntogether. One night when I was in bed I felt a sudden fear of fire, and\r\ngradually became as much oppressed by imaginary heat as though my room\r\nwere in flames. While in this situation, a fire-bell in the neighbourhood\r\nsounded, and added to my intense sufferings. I do not blush at what might\r\nbe called my superstition any more than I should blush in acknowledging\r\nthat my senses inform me that the earth does not move. My error forms the\r\n_body_ of my judgment, and I thank God that he has given it a _soul_\r\ncapable of correcting it. When I have been perfectly free from pain, as is\r\nnot unfrequently the case when I am in bed, my sense of this happiness has\r\nbrought tears of gratitude in my eyes. I once dreamt,\" adds Walderstein,\r\n\"that I was condemned to be burnt alive. I was very calm, and reasoned\r\ncoolly during the execution of my sentence. 'Now,' I said to myself, 'I am\r\nburning, but not yet burnt; and by-and-by I shall be reduced to a cinder.'\r\nThis was all I thought, and I did nothing but think. When, upon awaking, I\r\nreflected upon my dream, I was by no means pleased with it, for I was\r\nafraid I should become _all thought and no feeling_.\" It is strange that\r\nthis fear of thought, assuming a corporeal form in deep affliction, had\r\noccurred to our poet Rowe, when he exclaims in the Fair Penitent, \"_Turn\r\nnot to thought my brain_.\" \"What is very distressing,\" continues the\r\nunfortunate narrator, \"is, that when I am ill I can think nothing, feel\r\nnothing, without bringing it home to myself. It seems to me that the whole\r\nworld is a mere machine, expressly formed to make me feel my sufferings in\r\nevery possible manner.\" What a fearful avowal from a reflecting and\r\nintelligent man! Does it not illustrate Rousseau's definition of\r\nreason--_the knowledge of our folly_.\r\n\r\nDr. Rush mentions a man who imagined that he had a Caffre in his stomach\r\nwho had got into it at the Cape of Good Hope, and tormented him ever\r\nsince. Pinel relates the case of an unfortunate man who believed that he\r\nhad been guillotined, but his innocence having been made complete after\r\nhis execution, his judges decided that his head should be restored to him,\r\nbut the person intrusted with this operation had made a mistake, and put\r\non a wrong head. Dr. Conolly knew a man who really believed that he had\r\nbeen hanged, but had been brought to life by galvanism, but he maintained\r\nthat this operation had not restored the whole of his vitality.\r\n\r\nJacobi relates the case of a man confined in the lunatic asylum at\r\nWurtzburg, in other respects rational, of quiet, discreet habits, so that\r\nhe was employed in the domestic business of the house, but who laboured\r\nunder the impression that there was a person concealed in his stomach,\r\nwith whom he held frequent conversations. He often perceived the absurdity\r\nof this idea, and grieved in acknowledging and reflecting that he was\r\nunder the influence of so groundless a persuasion, but he never could get\r\nrid of it. \"It was very curious to observe,\" adds our intelligent author,\r\n\"how, when he had but an instant before cried what nonsense!--is it not\r\nintolerable to be thus deluded? and while the tears which accompanied\r\nthese exclamations were yet in his eyes, he again began to talk,\r\napparently with entire conviction about the person in his belly who told\r\nhim that he was to marry a great princess. An attempt was made to cure\r\nhim, by putting a large blister on his abdomen, and the instant that it\r\nwas dressed, moving from behind him a dressed-up figure, as if just\r\nextracted from his body. The experiment so far succeeded that the patient\r\nbelieved in the performance, and his joy was at first boundless in the\r\nfull persuasion that he was cured; but some morbid feeling about the\r\nbowels, which he had associated with the insane impression, still\r\ncontinuing, or being again experienced, he took up the idea that another\r\nperson similar to the first was still left within him, and under that\r\npersuasion he still continues to labour.\"\r\n\r\nA nobleman of the court of Louis XIV., fancied himself a dog, and would\r\ninvariably put his head out of window to bark aloud. Don Calmet relates\r\nthe case of some nuns in a convent in Germany, who imagined that they were\r\ntransformed into cats, and wandered about the building loudly mewing and\r\nspitting at and scratching each other.\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest aberrations of a disordered state of mind was\r\nexhibited by some impudent fellows who fancied themselves virtuous and\r\nmodest females. Esquirol relates the case of a young man of 26 years of\r\nage, handsome and of a good figure, who had been in the habit of\r\noccasionally putting on woman's attire to perform female parts in private\r\ntheatricals, and who had actually fancied himself a woman. In his\r\nparyoxysms he would put off his male clothes, and equip himself like a\r\nnymph,--the greater part of his day was spent before his looking-glass,\r\ndecorating his person and dressing his hair--he was incurable!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANCIENT IDEAS OF PHRENOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Gall and Spurzheim may fairly claim the merit of having developed\r\nin this science the particular parts of the brain that are the seat of\r\ndifferent faculties, yet we find in various ancient writers similar\r\nnotions. Burton, in his Anatomy of Melancholy, thus expresses himself on\r\nthis subject: \"_Inner senses_ are three in number, so called because they\r\nare in the brain-pan; as _common sense_, _phantasie_, _memory_. This\r\ncommon sense is the judge or moderator of the rest, by whom we discern all\r\ndifferences of objects; _the fore part of the brain_ is his organ or seat.\r\n_Phantasie_, or imagination, which some call aestimative, or cogitative,\r\n(confirmed saith, Fernelius, by frequent meditation,) is an inner sense,\r\nwhich doth more fully examine the species perceived by _common sense_, of\r\nthings present or absent, and keeps them longer, recalling them to mind\r\nagain, or making new of his own: his organ is the _middle cell of the\r\nbrain_. _Memory_ layes up all the species which the senses have brought\r\nin, and records them as a good register, that they may be forthcoming when\r\nthey are called for by _phantasie_ and _reason_; his organ is the _back\r\npart of the brain_.\" This corresponds with the account of the faculties\r\ngiven by Aristotle, and repeated by the writers of the middle ages.\r\nAlbertus Magnus, Bishop of Ratisbon, designed a head divided into regions\r\naccording to these opinions in the thirteenth century; and a similar plan\r\nwas published by Petrus Montaguana in 1491. Ludovico Dolce published\r\nanother engraving on the subject at Venice in 1562. In the British Museum\r\nis a chart of the universe and the elements of all sciences, and in which\r\na large head of this description is delineated. It was published at Rome\r\nin 1632. In the _Tesoretto_ of Brunetto Latini, the preceptor of Dante, we\r\nfind this doctrine taught in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  Nel capo son tre celle,\r\n  Ed io diro di quelle,\r\n  _Davanti_ e lo intelletto\r\n  E la forza d'apprendere\r\n  Quello que puote intendere;\r\n  _In mezzo_ e la ragione\r\n  E la discrezione,\r\n  Che scherne buono e male;\r\n  E lo terno e l'iguale\r\n  _Dirietro_ sta con gloria\r\n  La valente memoria,\r\n  Che ricorda e retiene\r\n  Quello ch'in essa viene.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERFUMES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt all periods perfumes seem to have been more or less adopted as a luxury\r\namong the wealthy and fashionable. Tradition states that they were\r\nfrequently rendered instrumental to sinister purposes, as the vehicle of\r\npoisonous substances. Historians relate that the Emperor Henri VI. and a\r\nprince of Savoy, were destroyed with perfumed gloves. Jeanne d'Albret,\r\nQueen of Navarre, and mother of Henri IV., died from the poisonous effect\r\nof gloves purchased from the noted Rene, perfumer and confidential agent\r\nof Catherine de Medicis. Lancelot, King of Naples, was destroyed by a\r\nscented handkerchief prepared by a Florentine lady. Pope Clement VII. sunk\r\nunder the baneful effluvia of a torch that was carried before him; and\r\nMathioli relates, that nosegays thus impregnated have been frequently\r\nknown to prove fatal. It is certain that, without the aid of venenous\r\nsubstances, various flowers have caused serious accidents. Barton tells us\r\nthat the _magnolia glauca_ occasioned a paroxysm of fever, and increased\r\nthe severity of an attack of gout. Jacquin had seen the _lobelia\r\nlongiflora_ producing a sense of suffocation; and the _nerium oleander_ in\r\na close chamber, has caused death. The injurious effects of bulbous\r\nflowers in giving rise to violent headachs, giddiness, and even fainting,\r\nare generally known. The horror roses inspire to the Roman ladies is\r\nscarcely credible; and Cromer affirms that it was to the odour of that\r\nornament of our gardens that the death of one of the daughters of Nicolas\r\nI., Count of Salm, and of a Polish bishop, was attributed. The sympathetic\r\neffect that this flower can create is illustrated by Capellini, who saw a\r\nlady fall into a syncope on perceiving a rose in a girl's bosom, although\r\nit turned out to be an artificial one. The partiality or antipathy to\r\ncertain odours is equally unaccountable, for the Italian ladies, who dread\r\nthe rose, delight in the disgusting aroma of rue, which they carry about\r\nas a salubrious plant, that, according to their notions, dispels the\r\n_cattiva aria_, although it is not impossible that they might fancy it\r\npossessed of those salutary qualities to which Ovid had alluded:\r\n\r\n  Utilius summas acuentes lumina rutas,\r\n  Et quidquid veneri corpora nostra negat.\r\n\r\nRue, according to Serenus Samonicus, was one of the ingredients of the\r\nfabled antidote of Mithridates, which he thus describes:\r\n\r\n  Antidotus vero multis Mithridatica fertur\r\n  Consociata modis, sed magnus Scrinia regis\r\n  Cum raperit victor, vilem deprendit in illis\r\n  Synthesim, et vulgata satis medicamina risit.\r\n  Bis denum _Rutae_ folium, salis et breve granum,\r\n  Juglandesque duas, totidem cum corpore ficus;\r\n  Haec oriente die, parco conspersa Lycaeo,\r\n  Sumebat, metuens dederat quae pocula mater.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were so fond of perfumes, that they scented their persons and\r\ngarments, their vases, their domestic vessels, and their military\r\ninsignia. They not only considered aromatic emanations as acceptable to\r\nthe gods, and therefore used them in their temples, as they are at present\r\nby the Roman Catholics, but as announcing the presence of their\r\ndivinities; and Virgil thus speaks of Venus:\r\n\r\n  --------Avertens rosea cervice refulsit,\r\n  Ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem\r\n  Spiravere.\r\n\r\nChaplets of roses were invariably worn in festivals and ceremonies; and\r\nwines were also aromatised with various odoriferous substances. The Franks\r\nand the Gauls continued the same custom; and Gregory of Tours called these\r\nartificial-flavoured liquors, _Vina odoramentis immixta_. To this day,\r\nthe manipulation of French wines gives them a fictitious _bouquet_, with\r\nraspberries, orris-root, and divers drugs to suit the British market.\r\n\r\nNo external sense is so intimately connected with the internal senses as\r\nthat of smell; none so powerful in exciting and removing syncope, or more\r\ncapable of receiving delicate and delicious impressions: hence Rousseau\r\nhas denominated this faculty \"_the sense of imagination_.\" No sensations\r\ncan be remembered in so lively a manner as those which are recalled by\r\npeculiar odours, which are frequently known to act in a most energetic\r\nmeasure upon our physical and moral propensities. How many perfumes excite\r\na lively feeling of fond regret when reminding us of the beloved one who\r\nwas wont to select them, and whom we long to meet again! It is not\r\nimprobable that our partiality to the hair of those who are dear to us,\r\narises from this circumstance. Every individual emits a peculiar odour;\r\nand, according to Plutarch, Alexander was distinguished by the sweet aroma\r\nthat he shed. Perhaps the expression, so frequently found in the lives of\r\nthe saints, \"who die in odour of sanctity,\" may be referred to a belief\r\nthat this peculiar gift was granted to beatitude.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that animals who possess the most acute smell, have\r\nthe nasal organs the most extensively developed. The Ethiopians and the\r\nAmerican Indians are remarkable for the acuteness of this sense,\r\naccounting for the wonderful power of tracking their enemies. But although\r\nwe may take the peculiar organization of their olfactory organs as being\r\npartly the cause of this keen perceptibility, we must in a great measure\r\nattribute this perfection to their mode of living. Hunting and war are\r\ntheir chief pursuits, to which they are trained from their earliest\r\ninfancy: therefore this perfection may, to a certain extent, be the result\r\nof habit; and the sight and hearing of these wanderers are as singularly\r\nperfect as their smelling. Mr. Savage relates, that a New Zealander heard\r\nthe report of a distant gun at sea, or perceived a strange sail, when no\r\nother man on board could discern it. Pallas, in speaking of the Calmucks,\r\nsays that many of them can distinguish by smelling at the hole of a fox\r\nwhether the animal be there or not; and on their journeys and military\r\nexpeditions they often smell out a fire or a camp, and thus seek quarters\r\nfor the night or booty. Olaus Borrich informs us, that the guides between\r\nSmyrna, Aleppo, and Babylon, when traversing the desert, ascertain\r\ndistances by the smell of the sand. That odours float in the atmospheric\r\nair is obvious; the distance at which they are perceived is incredible.\r\nThe spicy breezes of Ceylon are distinguished long before the island is\r\nseen; and it is a well-known fact that vessels have been saved by the\r\nolfactory acuteness of dogs, who, to use the common expression, were\r\nobserved to \"sniff\" the land that had not been descried. As a proof of the\r\nintimate connexion between smell and respiration, when the breath is held\r\nodorous substances are not perceived, and it is only after expiration that\r\nthey are again recognised. A proof of this may be easily obtained by\r\nplacing the open neck of a small phial containing an essential oil in the\r\nmouth during the acts of inspiration and subsequent expiration. Willis was\r\nthe first who observed that, on placing a sapid substance in the mouth,\r\nand at the same time closing the nostrils, the sensation of taste is\r\nsuspended; and this observation has given rise to the prevailing opinion\r\nthat smelling and tasting are intimately related. Odour which thus\r\naccompanies taste is termed flavour; and the ingenious Dr. Prout has\r\nadmirably defined the distinction between taste and flavour, and he\r\nconsiders the latter an intermediate sensation between taste and smell.\r\n\r\nThe acuteness of the sensation of smelling in animals is such, that in\r\nmany instances our observations have been deemed fabulous. The distance at\r\nwhich a dog tracks his master is scarcely credible; and it is strange that\r\nthe ancients attributed a similar perfection to the goose. Aelian affirms\r\nthat the philosopher Lycadeus had one of these birds that found him out\r\nlike a dog:\r\n\r\n  Humanum longe praesentit odorem\r\n  Romulidarum acris servator, candidus anser.\r\n\r\nBirds of prey will scent the battle-field at prodigious distances, and\r\nthey are often seen hovering instinctively over the ground where the\r\nconflict is to supply their festival. Humboldt relates, that in Peru, at\r\nQuito, and in the province of Popayan, when sportsmen wish to obtain that\r\nspecies of vulture called _vultur gryphus_, they kill a cow or a horse,\r\nand in a short time these sagacious birds crowd to glut their ravenous\r\nappetites. Ancient historians assert that vultures have cleft the air one\r\nhundred and sixty-six leagues to arrive in time to feast upon a battle;\r\nand Pliny boldly affirms that even crows have so acute a sense of\r\napproaching corruption, that they can scent death three days before\r\ndissolution, and generally pay the _moribond_ a visit a day before his\r\ntime, not to be disappointed. This notion has become a vulgar prejudice,\r\nas much so, indeed, as the howling of a dog, which is considered in most\r\ncountries as foreboding death. In various animals an offensive odour is a\r\nprotective gift. The _staphylinus olens_, for instance, sheds an effluvium\r\nwhich effectually keeps away the birds who would otherwise pounce upon\r\nhim. But of all singular perfections in the sense of smelling that were\r\never recorded, may be cited the monk of Prague and the blind man in the\r\nQuinze-vingt Hospital of Paris, who possessed the faculty of ascertaining\r\nthe presence of virginity whenever a female had the luck of being\r\nintroduced to them.\r\n\r\nMany curious instances are recorded, where the loss of one sense has added\r\nto the acuteness of others. Dr. Moyse the well-known blind philosopher,\r\ncould distinguish a black dress on his friends by the smell. Professor\r\nUpham of the United States, mentions a blind girl who could select her own\r\narticles out of a basket of linen brought in by the laundress.\r\n\r\nThese anomalous senses, for such they may be called, are as wonderful as\r\nthey are inexplicable, and appear to arise from a peculiar sensibility of\r\nthe organs of smell, which renders them capable of being stimulated in a\r\npeculiar manner, that no language can express or define. It is scent, no\r\ndoubt, that gives the migratory power to various animals; \"which enables\r\nthem,\" to use the words of Dr. Mason Good, \"to steer from climate to\r\nclimate, and from coast to coast; and which, if possessed by man, might\r\nperhaps render superfluous the use of the magnet, and considerably\r\ninfringe upon the science of logarithms? Whence comes it that the\r\nfieldfare and red-wing, that pass the summer in Norway, or the wild-duck\r\nand merganser, that in like manner summer in the woods and lakes of\r\nLapland, are able to track the pathless void of the atmosphere with the\r\nutmost nicety, and arrive on our own coasts uniformly in the beginning of\r\nOctober.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThis sense is not limited to migratory animals, as instanced by\r\ncarrier-pigeons, who have been known not only to carry bags in a straight\r\nline from city to city, but traverse the city with an undeviating flight.\r\nSurely this faculty must be attributed to the sense of smell; it can\r\nscarcely be referred to sight or hearing; although the wonders of the\r\ncreation are such, that we can no more account for these peculiar\r\nattributes refused to the lords of the creation, than for the power of the\r\nlobster, who not only can reproduce his claws when deprived of them by\r\naccident, but cast them off to extricate himself, from the captor's grasp.\r\nThe _Tipula pectiniformis_, or the daddy long-legs of our infant amusement\r\nand amazement, possesses the same renovating faculties. The gluttonous\r\ngad-fly may be cut to pieces without any apparent interruption in his\r\nmeal, when fastened to one's hand: the polype does not seem to be at all\r\ndiscomposed when we turn him inside out; and, when divided into various\r\nsections, each portion is endowed with an instinctive and reformative\r\npower of multiplying his species in countless numbers! The diversity of\r\nour olfactory fancies is unaccountable and only illustrates the words of\r\nPetronius,\r\n\r\n  Non omnibus unum est quod placet; hic spinas, colligit ille rosas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE PHILTERS AND POTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will scarcely be credited, but to this very day the superstitious\r\nbelief in the power that certain medicinal substances possess of causing a\r\nsympathetic fondness, still obtains, even amongst classes of the community\r\nwhose education one would imagine ought to have rendered such an absurdity\r\nrevolting. In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, the influence of love powders\r\nand aphrodisiac drugs is universally confided in.\r\n\r\nThe ancients thought that there existed, not only various charms to kindle\r\namorous feelings, but also to check all fond desires. The latter influence\r\nthey considered as _malefices_, vulgarly called in more modern times,\r\n\"point tying.\" Plato, in his Republic, warns husbands to be on their guard\r\nlest their domestic peace might be disturbed by these diabolical\r\npractices. Lovers, separated from each other's embrace by these nefarious\r\nenchantments, were said to be tied down. Thus Virgil,\r\n\r\n              Dic, Veneris vincula necto:\r\n  Terna tibi haec primum triplici diversa colore\r\n  Licia circumdo.\r\n\r\nNo power could release one from these bonds:\r\n\r\n  Quis neget et magicas nervos torpere per artes?\r\n\r\nBy the laws of the twelve tables such enchantments were punished with\r\ndeath; and Numantina, wife of Plautius Sylvanus, was accused,\r\n\r\n  Injecisse carminibus et veneficiis vecordiam marito.\r\n\r\nWhen Faustina, the gay bride of Marc Antonius was rapturously enamoured\r\nwith an histrionic favourite, she was only cured of her folly by a potion\r\nin which some of the comedian's blood had been introduced. Petrarch\r\nrelates of Charlemagne, that this monarch was so fondly attached to a fair\r\nlady, that after her death he carried about her embalmed body in a superb\r\ncoffin, until a venerable and learned bishop, who very wisely thought that\r\na living beauty was preferable to the remains of a departed one, rebuked\r\nhis sovereign for his irreligious and unnatural propensities, and revealed\r\nto him the important secret of his love arising from a charm that lay\r\nunder the dead woman's tongue. Whereupon the bishop went to the corpse,\r\nand drew from it a ring, which the emperor had scarcely looked upon when\r\nhe abhorred the former object of his attachment, and felt such an\r\nextraordinary fancy for the bishop that he could not dispense with his\r\npresence for a single moment, until the good prelate was so obseded with\r\nroyal favour that he cast the ring into a lake. From that moment\r\nCharlemagne (his historian continues) \"neglected all public business, and\r\nwent to live in the middle of a fen in the vicinity of Aix, where he built\r\na temple, near which he was finally buried.\"\r\n\r\nSt. Jerome, in the Life of Hilarius, mentions a young man who so\r\nbephiltered a maiden that she fell desperately in love with him; and\r\nSigismundus Schereczius, in his chapter _De Hirco Nocturno_, affirms that\r\n\"unchaste women, by the help of these witches, the devil's kitchen-maids,\r\nhave their lovers brought to them during the night, and carried back\r\nagain, by a phantom flying in the air in the likeness of a goat.\" \"I have\r\nheard,\" he adds, \"divers confess that they have been so carried on a\r\ngoat's back to their sweethearts many miles in a night.\" These wonderful\r\npotions were made of strange ingredients, for amongst them we find a\r\nman's blood chemically prepared, mandrake roots, dead men's clothes,\r\ncandles, a certain hair in a wolf's tail, a swallow's heart, dust of a\r\ndove's heart, tongues of vipers, brains of a jackass, pebbles found in an\r\neagle's nest, together with \"_palliola quibus infantes obvoluti\r\nnascuntur_, _funis strangulati hominis_,\" &c. &c. &c. Cleghorn, in his\r\nHistory of Minorca, tells us that water in which a hedgehog has been\r\nallowed to run into corruption, was supposed to be possessed of similar\r\nexciting powers; and a pulverized bit of a caul, scrapings of nails, and\r\nchopped hair, are to this hour deemed equally effectual to obtain these\r\ndesirable ends.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these absurdities, it is undoubtedly true that certain\r\narticles of food have been considered as endowed with aphrodisiac\r\nproperties; fish of various kinds, the mollusca and testaceous animals\r\nmore especially. Juvenal attributes this quality to oysters, which, in\r\nthis respect, with cockles and muscles have become vulgarly proverbial:\r\n\r\n  Grandia quae mediis jam noctibus ostrea mordet.\r\n\r\nWallich informs us that the ladies of his time had recourse on such\r\noccasions to the brains of the _mustela piscis_. The _sepia octopus_ was\r\nalso in great repute; and Plautus, in his _Casina_, brings on an old man\r\nwho had just been purchasing some in the market. There is reason to\r\nbelieve that these ideas were not altogether as absurd as they may appear.\r\nFourcroy and Vauquelin have attributed this influence to the presence of\r\nphosphorus, which is well known to be highly exciting. In the East,\r\nvarious vegetable productions are considered in the same light. Their\r\n_hakims_ have numerous receipts for the purpose; amongst which we find\r\nseveral electuaries,--such as the _diacyminum_, the _diaxylaloes_, the\r\nconfections of _Luffa Abunafa_, and the _chaschab abusidan_ of the\r\nArabians, of which wonderful effects are related.\r\n\r\nThe laws of every country have provided against the offence of witchcraft,\r\nsorcery, conjuration, and enchantment. We find a statute of our first\r\nJames, making it \"felony, without benefit of the clergy, under the penalty\r\nof death, the act of all persons invoking any evil spirit, or consulting,\r\ncovenanting with, entertaining, employing, feeding, or rewarding any evil\r\nspirits; or taking up dead bodies from their graves, to be used in any\r\nwitchcraft, sorcery, charm, or enchantment; or killing or otherwise\r\nhurting, any person by such infernal arts. And if any person should\r\nattempt by sorcery to discover hidden treasures, or to restore stolen\r\ngoods, or to _provoke unlawful love_, (lawful love did not come within\r\nthese salutary provisions,) he or she should suffer imprisonment and\r\npillory for the first offence, and death for the second.\" Strange to say,\r\nthat act continued in force till very lately; and Blackstone observes,\r\n\"that many poor wretches were sacrificed thereby to the prejudice of their\r\nneighbours, and their own illusions; not a few having, by some means or\r\nother, confessed the fact at the gallows.\"\r\n\r\nNothing could be more absurd, nay atrocious, than the means judicially\r\nresorted to at that period to detect witchcraft. Sir Robert Filmer\r\nmentions two tests by fire: the first by burning the house of the\r\npretended witch: the other, by burning any animal supposed to have been\r\nbewitched by her. In both these cases the witch would confess her\r\n_malefices_!\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was asserted that a witch, even while enduring the pangs of\r\ntorture, could only shed _three tears_, and those from the _left eye_;\r\nthis was considered a sufficient proof of guilt by the judges of the day!\r\nSwimming a witch was another expedient; in this ordeal the hag was\r\nstripped naked, and cross-bound, the right thumb to the left toe, and\r\n_vice versa_. Thus prepared, she was thrown into a pond or a river; in\r\nwhich, if guilty, she could not sink, for having by her compact with the\r\nDevil renounced the waters of baptism, the waters in return refused to\r\nreceive her in their bosom.\r\n\r\nOur wise legislators maintained that old women were generally selected by\r\nthe evil ones for their malicious purposes, and they usually appeared to\r\nthem in the form of a man wearing a black coat or gown; and sometimes,\r\nespecially in the north, with a bluish band and turned-up linen cuffs:\r\nhard bargains were sometimes driven between the parties for the value of\r\nthe harridan's soul. This was also the case according to Echard, in the\r\nnegotiation between Oliver Cromwell and the Devil before the battle of\r\nWorcester. There were black, white, and gray witches: some of them fond of\r\njunketing and merry-making, and often would Satan play on a pipe or a\r\ncittern to make them dance; and not unfrequently would he become enamoured\r\nwith their withered charms, when toads and horrible serpents were the\r\nhated progeny of this unhallowed union. Sinclair tells us, in his\r\n\"Invisible World,\" of one Mr. Barton, who was burnt with his wife for\r\nwitchcraft, and who confessed, before he was tied to the stake, that he\r\nhad intrigued with the Devil in the shape of a comely lady, who had given\r\nhim 15_l._ for his trouble. His wife confessed at the same time, that the\r\nDevil in the shape of a poodle dog used to dance before her, playing upon\r\nthe pipes with a candle under his tail. The Devil, particularly in\r\nScotland would ever and anon get up into a pulpit, and preach a sermon in\r\na voice \"_hough_ and _gustie_.\"\r\n\r\nBurton gives us some curious traditions of these devilish amours, and\r\nquotes Philostratus's account of one Menippus Lycius, a young man\r\ntwenty-five years of age, who going between Cenchreas and Corinth, met a\r\nphantom in the shape of a fair gentlewoman, which, taking him by the hand,\r\ncarried him to her house in the suburbs of Corinth; and told him she was a\r\nPhoenician by birth, and, if he would tarry with her he should hear her\r\nsing and play, and drink such wine as never was drunk, and no man should\r\nmolest him, but she, being fair and lovely, would live and die with him.\r\nThe young man tarried with her awhile to his great content, and at last\r\nmarried her; to whose wedding, amongst other guests, came Apollonius; who\r\nby some probable conjecture, found her out to be a serpent--a lamia. When\r\nshe saw herself discovered, she wept, and desired Apollonius to be silent;\r\nbut he would not be moved, and thereupon she, plate, house, and all that\r\nwas in it vanished in an instant.\r\n\r\nFlorigerus also mentions the case of a young gentleman of Rome, \"who on\r\nhis wedding day went out walking with his bride and some friends after\r\ndinner; and towards the evening went to a tennis-court, and while he\r\nplayed he took off his ring, and placed it upon the finger of a brass\r\n_Venus statua_. The game finished, he went to fetch his ring; but Venus\r\nhad bent her finger upon it, and he could not get it off. Whereupon, loth\r\nto make his companions tarry, he there left it, intending to fetch it the\r\nnext day, went thence to supper, and so to bed; but in the night Venus had\r\nslipped between him and his wife, and thus troubled him for several\r\nsuccessive nights. Not knowing how to help himself, he made his moan to\r\none Palumbus, a learned magician; who gave him a letter, and bade him at\r\nsuch a time of the night, in such a cross way, where old Saturn would pass\r\nby with his associates, to deliver to him the script: the young man, of a\r\nbold spirit, accordingly did it; and when the old fiend had read it, he\r\ncalled Venus to him, who was riding before him, and commanded her to\r\ndeliver the ring, which forthwith she did.\"\r\n\r\nBurton further quotes St. Augustine, Bodin, Paracelsus, and various other\r\nlearned men, who firmly maintain that the Devil is particularly fond of a\r\nlittle flirtation with the ladies; and a Bavarian widower, who was sadly\r\ngrieving for his beloved wife, was visited by Old Nick, who had assumed\r\nthe form of the departed lady, and promised to live with him and comfort\r\nhim on the condition that he would leave off swearing and blaspheming; he\r\nvowed it, married her, and she brought him several children; till one day,\r\nin an uxorious quarrel, he began to swear like a Pandour, whereupon she\r\nvanished, and never more was seen.\r\n\r\nThe preservatives against witchcraft were as absurd as the fear it\r\ninspired: some hair, parings of nails, or any part of a person bewitched,\r\nwere put into a stone bottle, with crooked nails, then corked close, and\r\nhung up the chimney; this expedient occasioned most horrible tortures to\r\nthe witch, until the bottle was uncorked. Witches, moreover, cannot pursue\r\ntheir victims beyond the middle of a running stream, provided the\r\nfugitives had been baptized. I have now a patient under my care who\r\nfancies himself bewitched, and asserts that the only way to guard against\r\nthe evil is by driving a nail in the impress left by a witch's foot on the\r\nthreshold, when she will discontinue her visits.\r\n\r\nBy an act of George II. these offences were considered as misdemeanors,\r\nand punished with a year's imprisonment, and standing four times in the\r\npillory. There is no doubt that, notwithstanding the absurdity of such\r\ndelusions and impostures, legislators must endeavour to secure the\r\nignorant against these impositions, which are frequently of a perilous\r\nnature, and have been often known to occasion serious accidents, and even\r\ndeath. Many of the substances thus administered are of a most dangerous\r\ndescription, and these enchantments are not unfrequently resorted to with\r\nsinister intentions. It is related of the Asiatic women, that, under the\r\npretext of giving these philters, they sometimes times prepare a beverage\r\nfrom the seeds of the _Datura Metel_, which produces a lethargic\r\nstupefaction of a convenient nature. The mischief that has frequently\r\narisen from the exhibition of the _Lytta vesicatoria_ has been observed\r\nand recorded by every medical practitioner. The _Diablotini_, a kind of\r\nincentive sugar-plums of the Italians, have been known to occasion the\r\nmost serious accidents; and the celebrated French actor Mole lost his life\r\nin one of these experiments. Yet penal enactments, in such cases, must be\r\nresorted to with much circumspection; for prohibition too frequently\r\npromotes the evils which it is designed to check.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu observes, that the ridiculous stories that are generally told,\r\nand the many impositions that have been discovered in all ages, are enough\r\nto demolish all faith in such a dubious crime, if the contrary evidence\r\nwere not also extremely strong. Unquestionably, we have too many\r\ninstances of criminal acts of superstition in which supernatural agency is\r\nbelieved; but did this philosophic writer mean to say that we have\r\nevidence of actual witchcraft and sorcery? It is with some degree of\r\nregret that we find our learned Blackstone avow his belief in these\r\nmatters, and we borrow his own words on the subject: \"To deny the\r\npossibility, nay, the actual existence of witchcraft and sorcery, is at\r\nonce flatly to contradict the revealed Word of God, in various passages\r\nboth of the New and Old Testament; and the thing itself is a truth to\r\nwhich every nation in the world hath in its turn borne testimony, either\r\nby examples seemingly well attested, or by prohibitory laws which at least\r\nsuppose the possibility of a commerce with evil spirits. The civil law\r\npunishes with death not only the sorcerers themselves, but also those who\r\nconsult them; imitating in the former the express law of God, 'Thou shalt\r\nnot suffer a witch to live!'\" Without calling into doubt the records of\r\nsupernatural agency in Holy Writ, evident manifestations of the power and\r\nthe will of the Divinity at that period, it may fairly be asked--Can we\r\npromulgate such opinions in the present times, when miraculous events do\r\nnot seem to be permitted by our Creator in His inscrutable wisdom, without\r\nincurring the risk of plunging the ignorant in all the dark horrors of the\r\nearly ages? Montesquieu himself has justly remarked, \"that the most\r\nunexceptionable conduct, the purest morals, and the constant practice of\r\nevery duty in life, are not a sufficient security against the suspicion of\r\ncrimes like these.\" And yet, because, forsooth, there may be made to\r\nappear _examples seemingly attested_, and that on the faith of such an\r\nattestation the most absurd and cruel _prohibitory laws_ have been enacted\r\nby every _nation in the world, on the supposition of the possibility of\r\nsuch a crime_, however ignorant and brutalized by superstition these\r\nnations are or may have been, man is not only authorized by the Scriptures\r\nto persecute some poor miserable fool or vagrant impostor unto death, but\r\nhe is sanctioned in founding this barbarous persecution on the laws of\r\nGod! The mind sickens at such doctrines. It is grievous to find a man like\r\nour Addison sharing in such preposterous notions; notions which would\r\ninduce a doubtful by-stander not to interfere with a mob of miscreants who\r\nwere drowning some unfortunate old woman \"for a witch.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are,\" says Addison, \"some opinions in which a man should stand\r\n_neuter_, without engaging his assent to one side or the other. It is with\r\nthis temper of mind that I consider the subject of witchcraft. When I\r\nconsider whether there are such persons in the world as those we call\r\nwitches, my mind is divided between the two opposite opinions; or rather,\r\nto speak my thoughts freely, I believe in general that _there is_, and has\r\nbeen, such a thing as witchcraft, but, at the same time, can give no\r\ncredit to any particular instance of it.\"\r\n\r\nAre we then still to believe that there may exist some supernatural hag,\r\nthat can\r\n\r\n  --------Untie the winds, and let them fight\r\n  Against the churches--------\r\n  Control the moon, make ebbs and flows,\r\n  And deal in her command without her power?\r\n\r\nor who, with the influence given to them by our poet Rowe,\r\n\r\n  By force of potent spells, of bloody characters,\r\n  And conjurations horrible to hear,\r\n  Call fiends and spectres from the yawning deep,\r\n  And set the ministers of hell to work,\r\n\r\nwith the liver of a blaspheming Jew, the nose of a Turk, the lips of a\r\nTartar, the finger of a birth-strangled babe, and ditch-delivered by a\r\ndrab, &c. &c.? If we are to believe in witches with Blackstone and\r\nAddison, we must give credence to all these mystic means by which they\r\n_work_ their _way_. All these _means_ have been _seemingly attested_, and\r\nled, from the just horror they inspired, to those _prohibitory laws_\r\nenacted by _every nation_; as if the laws of man could be of any avail in\r\nresisting the _admitted_ supernatural powers with which these witches,\r\nsorcerers, magicians, &c. must have been invested by the Deity to perform\r\ntheir terrific operations! If we deny this authority we are Manicheans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVENTRILOQUISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis peculiar faculty was well known to the ancients. Hippocrates verily\r\nbelieved that there did exist individuals who could draw a voice from\r\ntheir belly. He speaks of the wife of Polimarchus, who, being affected\r\nwith a quinsy, spoke in this manner; hence this power was called\r\n_Engastrimysm_. Plato gives the history of Euricles, who mentions three\r\npersons whom St. Chrysostom and Oecumenius considered to be endowed with\r\na heavenly gift. Caelius Rhodiginus describes an old woman of Rovigo who\r\nused to deliver her oracles in the like manner, and who was never so\r\neloquent as when stripped to the skin, when she would answer most\r\naccurately all the questions put to her by a familiar who attended upon\r\nher, and was called Cincinnatulus. Anthony Vandael, a physician of Harlem,\r\nconsidered ventriloquism as a supernatural power, enabling the voice to\r\nproceed \"ex ventre inferiore et partibus genitalibus;\" and he describes a\r\nwoman of seventy-three years of age, called Barbara Jacobi, who used to\r\nventriloquise with an imp of the name of Joachim, who would weep most\r\npiteously, or fall into roars of laughter, and sometimes danced and sung\r\nwith remarkable grace and elegance, according to the depressing or the\r\nexhilarating nature of Mrs. Jacobi's communications. In the Septuagint the\r\nHebrew word _Ob_ is rendered by _Engastrimythos_; and it was supposed that\r\nthe Pythoness who evoked Samuel had recourse to this power. Oleaster,\r\nGrand Inquisitor of Portugal, in a work published at Lisbon in 1656,\r\nmentions a woman of the name of Cecilia who was brought before the court,\r\nand expressed herself in a ventriloquial voice, which she said was that of\r\none Peter John, who had been dead for many years; but Peter John pleaded\r\nin vain for his hostess, for, despite his abdominal eloquence, she was\r\nsentenced to be transported. Whether Peter John accompanied her in exile\r\nis not stated. In 1643, Dickinson mentions a man at Oxford, who was called\r\nthe King's Whisperer, and who expressed himself most clearly without\r\nopening the mouth or moving the lips. This faculty has frequently been\r\nemployed in various speculations. In the sixteenth century, Borden relates\r\nthe story of a valet of Francis I., named Brabant, who thus persuaded the\r\nmother of a young girl he courted to grant her consent to their marriage\r\nas speedily as possible, if she wished her husband's soul to get out of\r\nthe torments of purgatory: after marriage, however, he was disappointed in\r\nhis pecuniary expectations, and he applied his powers of ventriloquism to\r\nterrify a rich banker of Lyons, of the name of Corner, to bestow a fortune\r\nupon his wife; for which purpose he assumed the voice of Corner's father,\r\nwho supplicated him to give the money as the only means of sending his\r\npoor consuming soul to paradise.\r\n\r\nOne of the most celebrated ventriloquists was a grocer of St. Germains,\r\none St. Gilles; but he applied the faculty he possessed to benevolent\r\npurposes. Being called to reclaim a newly-married young man from a\r\ndisgraceful connexion, which rendered his wife most unhappy, his\r\nsupernatural voice, supposed to come from heaven, succeeded; and he was\r\nequally fortunate in bringing to a sense of propriety one of the most\r\nsordid misers of his time.\r\n\r\nSt. Gilles was not so felicitous in a trick he played to some monks,\r\nvainly attempting to prove the absurdity of their superstitious notions.\r\nOne of the community had lately died, and, according to custom, the\r\ndeceased was laid out in the church, and his brethren, grouped around him,\r\nwere pouring forth prayers for the repose of his soul, when St. Gilles,\r\nthrowing his voice into the coffin, returned them all the thanks of the\r\ndeparted friar for their supplications in his behalf. The astonished monks\r\nwere most edified at this miraculous event; and their prior, who knew St.\r\nGilles to be a freethinker, endeavoured to impress upon his mind the\r\nwonder that he himself had performed, and to inveigh most earnestly\r\nagainst the impiety and incredulity of modern philosophers, who\r\nentertained sceptic ideas concerning miracles. After a long exhortation,\r\nour ventriloquist burst into a fit of laughter, and avowed the deception\r\nhe had practised: to convince the brotherhood of the veracity of his\r\nassertion, he gave them various specimens of his skill,--but to no\r\npurpose; he was called an infidel, a scoffer, an atheist, and, had it been\r\nin Spain, the stake would in all probability have rewarded his perilous\r\nfrolic, or his stiff-necked impiety in refusing to believe in his own\r\nmiracles.\r\n\r\nIt is now pretty generally admitted that ventriloquism simply consists in\r\na slow and gradual expiration, preceded by a strong and deep inspiration,\r\nby which a considerable quantity of air is introduced into the lungs,\r\nwhich is afterwards acted upon by the flexible powers of the larynx and\r\nthe trachea: any person therefore, by practice, can obtain more or less\r\nexpertness in this exercise; in which, although not apparently, the voice\r\nis still modified by the mouth and the tongue. Mr. Lespagnol, in a very\r\nable dissertation on this subject, has demonstrated that ventriloquists\r\nhave acquired by practice the power of exercising the veil of the palate\r\nin such a manner, that, by raising or depressing it, they dilate or\r\ncontract the inner nostrils. If they are closely contracted, the sound\r\nproduced is weak, dull, and seems to be more or less distant; if, on the\r\ncontrary, these cavities are widely dilated, the sound is strengthened by\r\nthese tortuous infractuosities, and the voice becomes loud, sonorous, and\r\napparently close to us. Thus any able mimic who can with facility disguise\r\nhis voice, with the aid of this power of modifying sounds, may in time\r\nbecome a ventriloquist.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAUCER'S DESCRIPTION OF A PHYSICIAN. THE DOCTOR OF PHYSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\n  With us there was a doctour of phisike;\r\n  In all this world, ne was there none him like\r\n  To speake of phisike and of surgerie,\r\n  For he was grounded in astronomie.\r\n  He kept his patient a full great dell\r\n  In houses: by his magike naturell\r\n  Well couth he fortune the assendent\r\n  Of his image for his pacient.\r\n  He knew the cause of every malady,\r\n  Whether it were of cold, heate, moist, or dry.\r\n  And whereof engendered was each humour.\r\n  He was a very parfit practisour;\r\n  The cause I knew, and of his haime the roote,\r\n  Anon he gave to the rich man his boot.\r\n  Full ready had he his apoticaries\r\n  To send him drugs and his lectuaries;\r\n  For each of them made other for to winne,\r\n  Their friendship was not new to beginne.\r\n  Well he knew the old Esculapius,\r\n  And Diascorides, and eke Ruffus,\r\n  And Hippocrates, and Galen,\r\n  Serapion, Rasis, and Avicen,\r\n  Aberrois, Damascene, and Constantin,\r\n  Bernard, Galisden, and Gilbertin\r\n  Of his diet measurable was he,\r\n  For it was of no superfluitie;\r\n  But of great nourishing and digestible.\r\n  His study was but little on the Bible.\r\n  In sanguine and in percepolad withall\r\n  Lined with taffata and with sendall;\r\n  And yet he was but easy of dispence.\r\n  He kept that he won in time of pestilence;\r\n  For gold in phisike is a cordial,\r\n  Therefore he loved gold speciall.\r\n\r\nIt appears from this quaint and satirical picture, that, in our Chaucer's\r\ndays, astrology formed part of a physician's study. It also plainly proves\r\nthat a disgraceful collusion prevailed between medical practitioners and\r\ntheir apothecaries, mutually to enrich each other at the expense of the\r\npatient's purse and constitution. The poet, moreover, seems to tax the\r\nfaculty with irreligion: that unjust accusation was not uncommon; hence\r\nthe old adage, \"Ubi tres medici, duo athei.\" To the disgrace of many\r\nilliberal persons of the present age, we have known some of our most able\r\nand praiseworthy physiologists charged with materialism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAEMONOMANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis disease is perhaps the most distressing species of insanity; since,\r\nwith the exception of the miserable belief of being possessed by the evil\r\nspirit, the patient is often in full possession of his other faculties,\r\nand will even endeavour to reason with his attendants, with some apparent\r\nplausibility, on the very aberration that constitutes the malady.\r\n\r\nThe word 'daemon' among the ancients was not considered as specific of an\r\nevil spirit; on the contrary, it signified genius, intellect, mind.\r\n[Greek: Daimonion], from [Greek: daimon], meant wisdom, science. The first\r\nnotions of daemons were probably brought from Chaldea, whence they spread\r\namongst the Persians, Egyptians, and Greeks. Gales maintains that the\r\noriginal institution of daemons was an imitation of the Messiah. The\r\nPhoenicians called them _Baalim_. So far do these early opinions\r\nprevail, that among the Anabaptists we find a sect called Daemoniac, who\r\nbelieve that devils shall be saved at the end of the world.\r\n\r\nPlato gave the name of daemons to the benevolent spirits who regulated the\r\nuniverse. The Chaldeans and Jews considered them as the causes of all\r\nhuman maladies. Saul was agitated by an evil spirit, and Job and Joram\r\nsuffered under a similar visitation.\r\n\r\nDaemonomania differs widely from the mental disease called Theomania. In\r\nthe latter state of insanity the patient fancies that he is placed in\r\ncommunication with the Deity or his angels; in the former, he feels\r\nconvinced that he has become the prey of the destroyer of mankind.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of \"Unlawful Cures,\" instances are related of the firm\r\nbelief in the power of evil spirits to cause various diseases. Perhaps the\r\norigin of daemonomania may be traced to fanatical persecution; never was\r\nthe malady so common as during the denunciations of Calvin, when torture\r\nwas frequently resorted to, to make the victims of bigotry renounce a\r\nsupposed pact with the devil. D'Agessau was right when, in advising the\r\nparliament of Paris to repeal all statutes against sorcery, he recommended\r\nthat daemoniacs should be handed over to the physician, instead of the\r\npriest or the executioner.\r\n\r\nThe sufferings which daemoniacs say they endure must be excruciating; so\r\npowerful is moral influence over our physical sensations. They will tell\r\nyou that the devil is drawing them tight, and suffocating them with a\r\ncord; that he is pinching and lacerating their entrails, burning and\r\ntearing their heart, pouring hot oil or molten lead in their veins, while\r\ninternal flames are consuming them. Their strength is exhausted, their\r\ndigestive functions impaired, their appearance soon becomes miserable in\r\nthe extreme, their countenances pale and haggard: the wretched creatures\r\nendeavour to conceal themselves during their scanty meals, or their\r\nattempts to enjoy a broken slumber; they are persuaded that they no longer\r\npossess a corporeal existence that requires refection or repose,--the evil\r\nspirit has borne away their bodies, the devil requires no earthly support;\r\nthey even deny their sex: they are doomed to live for ever in constant\r\nagony. These unfortunate creatures are mostly women. One of them asserts,\r\nwith horrid imprecations, that she has been the devil's wife for a million\r\nof years, and had borne him a numerous family; her body is nothing but a\r\nsack made of a devil's skin, and filled with their offsprings in the shape\r\nof devouring snakes, toads, and venomous reptiles. She exclaims that her\r\nhusband constantly urges her to commit murder, theft, and every imaginable\r\ncrime; and sometimes with bitter tears supplicates her keeper to put on a\r\nstrait waistcoat, to prevent her from doing evil. Another woman,\r\nforty-eight years of age, assures us that she has two devils who have\r\ntaken up their residence in both her hips, and have grown up to her ears:\r\none of them is black and yellow, the other black, both in the shape of\r\ncats. She fills her ears with snuff and grease to satisfy their diabolical\r\ncravings. She eats with voracity, but is a perfect skeleton in appearance;\r\nthe devils consume all, and leave her nothing. They constantly bid her to\r\ngo and drown herself; but she cannot obey them, since eternity is her\r\ndoom. They are scarcely sensible of painful agents, and are unconscious of\r\nheat, cold, or the inclemency of the weather. Their perspiration,\r\nfrequently profuse, exhales a most unpleasant odour; hence the vulgar\r\nfancy that they smell of the lower regions. This circumstance is the usual\r\nconsequence of many nervous affections, and arises, most probably, from\r\nthe foulness of the breath, a natural result of impaired digestion, and\r\nfrom a peculiar acrimony of the cutaneous secretions.\r\n\r\nPinel relates the case of a missionary whose enthusiastic aberrations led\r\nhim into the horrible belief, that he could only be saved from eternal\r\ntorments, by what he called a _baptism of blood_. This fatal mania induced\r\nhim to attempt the life of his wife, who was fortunate to escape from the\r\ndanger, after he had immolated two of his children, to secure their\r\nsalvation! Tried for this crime he was sentenced to perpetual confinement\r\nin Bicetre. In his dungeon he fancied himself the _fourth person in the\r\ntrinity_, maintained that he was sent upon earth to baptize with blood,\r\nand all the power of the universe could not affect his life. During ten\r\nyears' confinement this miserable wretch, betrayed the same insanity\r\nwhenever religious subjects were touched upon, in all other matters, he\r\nreasoned most soundly. His lucid intervals at last became so long in their\r\nduration and calm, that it was questioned whether he might not be\r\nliberated--until on a Christmas eve, his sanguinary monomania resumed all\r\nits intensity, and having by some means or other obtained possession of a\r\nleather-cutter's knife, he inflicted a desperate wound on one of his\r\nkeepers, and cut the throat of two patients who were near them; many other\r\ninmates of the establishment would, no doubt, have been sacrificed by the\r\ndesperate maniac had he not been secured. This case might decidedly be\r\nconsidered one of true daemonomania.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally remarked that cases of daemonomania are more common\r\namongst women than in men. Their greater susceptibility to nervous\r\naffections, their warmth of imagination and strong passions, which habit\r\nand education compel them to restrain, produce a state of concentration\r\nthat must cause increased excitement, and render them more liable to those\r\nterrific impressions that constitute the disease. These terrors, from\r\nfalse notions of the Deity, make them anticipate in this world the\r\nsufferings denounced in the next. One woman has been known to become\r\ndaemonomaniac after an intense perusal of the Apocalypse, and another by\r\nthe constant reading of the works of Thomas a Kempis. Women, moreover, at\r\ncertain critical periods are subject to great mental depression, which\r\nthey have not the power to relieve by exciting pursuits, like men.\r\nMelancholy succeeds a dull sameness. Religion, viewed in a false light,\r\nbecomes her refuge; more especially at an advanced period of life, when\r\nloss of youth and beauty is bitterly felt, as galled vanity compares the\r\npresent with the past. Hysteric symptoms are now developed: the passions,\r\nwhich are too frequently increased even to intensity, rather than cooled,\r\nby years, prompt her to rebellious thoughts that religion and virtuous\r\nfeelings strive to restrain; and these powerful agents, acting upon a\r\npredisposition morbidly impressionable from ignorance or the errors of\r\neducation, accelerate the invasion of this cruel malady. Jacobi informs\r\nus, that this is still the character which, in some catholic countries,\r\ninsanity connected with superstition frequently assumes.\r\n\r\nPliny tells us that women are the best subjects for magical experiments;\r\nQuintilian is of the same opinion: Saul consults a witch; Bodin, in his\r\ncalculations, estimates the proportion between wizards and witches as one\r\nto fifty. It is, perhaps, owing to these remarks that many ungenerous\r\nwriters have denied _women_ a soul, as not belonging to _mankind_. There\r\nexists a curious anonymous work, published at the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, to prove that women are not men, or, in other words, reasonable\r\ncreatures, and entitled \"_Dissertatio perjucunda qua Anonymus probare\r\nnititur Mulieres homines non esse_.\" Our author upon this principle\r\nendeavours to show that women cannot be saved. One Simon Geddicus, a\r\nLutheran divine, wrote a serious confutation of this libel upon the fair\r\nsex, in 1595, and promises the ladies an expectation of salvation on their\r\ngood behaviour. According to a popular tradition among the Mahometans,\r\nwomen are excluded from paradise: St. Augustin, however, calls them the\r\n_devout sex_; and in the prayer to the Virgin of the Romish Church we find\r\n\"_Intercede pro devoto foemineo sexu_.\" An hypothesis still more absurd\r\nwas broached by a Doctor Almaricus, a theological Parisian writer of the\r\ntwelfth century, who advanced that, had it not been for the original sin,\r\nevery individual of our species would have come into existence a complete\r\nman; and that God would have created them by himself, as he created Adam.\r\nOur worthy doctor was a disciple of Aristotle, who maintained that woman\r\nwas a defective animal, and her generation purely fortuitous and foreign\r\nto nature. Howbeit, my fair readers will learn with satisfaction that the\r\ndoctrines of this aforesaid Almaricus were condemned by the church as\r\nheretical, and his bones were therefore dug up, and cast into a common\r\nsewer, as an _amende honorable_ to the offended ladies.\r\n\r\n\"A woman,\" says one of the primitive fathers of the church, \"went to the\r\nplay, and came back with the devil in her; whereupon, when the unclean\r\nspirit was urged and threatened, in the office of exorcising, for having\r\ndared to attack one of the faithful, 'I have done nothing,' replied he,\r\n'but what is very fair; I found her on my own grounds, and I took\r\npossession of her.'\"\r\n\r\nSt. Cyprian informs us, that when he was studying magic, he was\r\nparticularly intimate with the devil. \"I saw the devil himself,\" he says;\r\n\"embraced him; I conversed with him, and was esteemed one of those who\r\nheld a principal rank about him.\" Who can doubt the assertion of a saint!\r\nIt appears, that in those wonderful days the devil usually wore a black\r\ngown, with a black hat; and it was observed that, whenever he was\r\npreaching, his _glutei muscles_ were as cold as ice.\r\n\r\nAt all times satire has endeavoured to make invidious distinctions between\r\nthe sexes: this is not fair. Women are generally what men have made them.\r\nIn a physical, and, consequently, to a certain degree in a moral point of\r\nview, their organization is essentially different from ours; therefore, a\r\nmasculine woman is as intolerable as an effeminate man. The education of\r\nfemales tends in a great measure to increase that susceptibility to\r\ntrifling excitements, which in after-life urges them to the extremes of\r\ngood or evil. While the toys and amusements of boys are of a manly nature,\r\na girl is taught to practise upon her darling doll all the arts which a\r\nfew years after she will practise upon herself. Many intelligent writers\r\nhave doubted the expediency of giving woman any education beyond the\r\nsphere of her domestic pursuits and occupations; Erasmus wrote largely on\r\nthis subject to Budaeus. Vives treats of it in his _Institutio foeminae\r\nChristianae_; and a German authoress, Madame Schurman, has published a\r\ntreatise on the problem, \"_Num foeminae Christianae conveniat studium\r\nliterarum?_\"\r\n\r\nIt is this nervous flexibility in women that exposes them to that constant\r\nsuccession of emotions which are expressed by a rapid transition from\r\ntears to smiles; and, anomalous as it may appear, they are more exposed to\r\nfond impressions in their grief than at any other moment; they then feel\r\nmore helpless, and stand in greater need of consolation. The story of the\r\nMatron of Ephesus is not so great a libel on the sex as one might imagine.\r\nTheir mind is prone to romantic enthusiasm; they delight in the\r\nextraordinary, the terrible, and as Madame de Sevigne, who well knew her\r\nsex, expresses it, they enjoy in chivalric tales _les grands coups\r\nd'epee_. Prudence preventing them too frequently from expressing their\r\nthoughts, thinking becomes more intense; and Publius Syrus has said,\r\n\"_Mulier quae sola cogitat, male cogitat_:\" but when the suppressed volcano\r\nbursts forth, its eruptions are boundless; it is then that one may\r\nexclaim, \"_Notumque fuerit quid foemina possit_.\" No passion is more\r\noverwhelming than when it has been kept down by dissimulation; opportunity\r\nis their curse: Montaigne has too truly said, \"_Oh le furieux avantage que\r\nl'opportunite_!\" and our Denham has beautifully illustrated its fearful\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\n  Opportunity, like a sudden gust,\r\n  Hath swell'd my calmer thoughts into a tempest.\r\n  Accursed opportunity!\r\n  That works our thoughts into desires; desires\r\n  To resolutions; those being ripe and quickened,\r\n  Thou giv'st them birth, and bring'st them forth to action.\r\n\r\nIt is a perilous ordeal for such to whom the lines of Ovid might apply,\r\n\r\n  Quae, quia non liceat, non facit; illa facit.\r\n\r\nTo what prejudice against women are we to trace their sex having been\r\nchosen to represent the Furies, stern and inexorable ministers of Divine\r\nwrath; the Harpies, who defiled all they touched; the perilous Sirens;\r\nunless it be to woman's fascinations in youth, and envious bitterness in\r\nold age--the conventional type of witchcraft? This unhappy selection of\r\nwoman for working _malefices_ has been attributed to the facility which\r\nthe devil found in tempting Eve. A witch is supposed by the most learned\r\nin the black art to be in compact with Satan, whom she is obliged to obey;\r\nwhereas a sorcerer commands the devil himself by his knowledge of charms\r\nand invocations, but more especially of perfumes that the evil spirits\r\ndelight in when properly suffumigated, or abhor when maliciously given\r\nthem to smell. Thus the burning of a fish's liver by Tobit drove the devil\r\ninto the remote parts of Egypt; and Lilly informs us, that one Evans\r\nhaving raised a spirit at the request of Lord Bothwell and Sir Kenelm\r\nDigby, and forgotten his favourite fumigation or incense, the angry elf\r\nwhipped him up, and carried him from his house in the Minories to\r\nBattersea Causeway.\r\n\r\nAlthough fairies are mostly considered juvenile, and many of their kind\r\nacts are recorded, yet are they in general mischievous imps; Mr. Lewis\r\ndescribes those he saw in the silver and lead mines of Wales, as only\r\nbeing about half a yard high. As a punishment for their vagaries, all\r\ntheir children are stunted and idiotic; and this accounts for their\r\nabominable custom of substituting their own \"base elfin breed\" for healthy\r\ninfants. Hence are idiots commonly called changelings.\r\n\r\nDaemoniacs are prone to commit suicide, less from their loathing an irksome\r\nlife than through fear, not of future torments, but of the renewal or the\r\ncontinuance of their worldly sufferings. Perhaps they may entertain some\r\ndoubts as to the punishment of another existence, while their actual\r\ncondition is intolerable; we not unfrequently see desperate men rushing to\r\nmeet the very fate they dread.\r\n\r\nDaemonomania may be referred to a false view of divine justice,--ignorance,\r\nand consequent weakness of intellect,--and a pusillanimous apprehension of\r\nperhaps a merited chastisement. It is a disease which seldom admits of a\r\ncure. If the consolations of true religion are proffered, they are either\r\nspurned with anger, or merely produce an evanescent melioration. Zacutus\r\nrelates the case of a daemoniac who was cured by a person who appeared to\r\nher in the form of an angel, to inform her that her sins had been\r\nforgiven: it is possible that stratagems of a similar nature might\r\nprevail. I attended a monomaniac lady in Paris, who fancied herself in\r\nJerusalem on the eve of its destruction. She furiously opposed all\r\nendeavours to move her from her residence; and it was only by personating\r\na Jewish rabbi, and offering to take her to New Jerusalem as a place of\r\nrefuge, that she consented to accompany me in a carriage to a _maison de\r\nsante_ near the capital. Here imagination subdued imagination. I have had\r\nthe pleasure to hear that ever since I thus succeeded in breaking a link\r\nin the morbid association of her fancies, her state of mind rapidly\r\nimproved, and that she is now restored to perfect sanity.\r\n\r\nDaemonomania has been known to be epidemic. From 1552 to 1554 no less than\r\neighty-four persons became possessed in Rome. The endeavours of a French\r\nmonk to exorcise them proved of no avail; and as most of the unfortunate\r\nvictims of credulity were Jewesses who had consented to be baptized, the\r\nJews were of course accused of sorcery. About the same period a similar\r\ndisease broke out in a convent near Kerndrop, in Germany, when all the\r\nnuns were possessed, and denounced their cook, who, having confessed that\r\nshe was a witch, was duly burnt alive with her mother.\r\n\r\nDaemonomania has been considered an hereditary visitation, and whole\r\nfamilies have therefore been deemed in pact with the evil one. Insanity is\r\nunfortunately known to attach itself to certain generations; but perhaps\r\nit has not been sufficiently observed, when endeavouring to account for\r\nthis melancholy fact, that the mind becomes gradually influenced by the\r\nnature of the constant conversation we daily and hourly are exposed to\r\nhear; and it is not impossible but that this transmission of mental\r\ndisease may be attributed to morbid moral and physical sympathies, which\r\nmight be avoided by withdrawing the persons exposed to it from the sphere\r\nof their action. Constant anxious thoughts and painful reflections tend to\r\nproduce an increased sensorial power in the brain, with a diminished\r\nsensibility to external impressions. So great has been this effect upon\r\nthe senses, that maniacs have been seen to gaze upon the meridian sun\r\nwithout any sensible effect on the organs of vision. It is therefore\r\npossible that an individual who beholds with incessant horror insanity in\r\nhis family, or who constantly hears of their aberrations, may ultimately\r\nexperience a similar peculiarity of the mind: hence wit as well as madness\r\nhave been known to be the heir-looms of a race. Although the examples of\r\nvice, one might imagine, would inspire a love for virtuous actions, yet we\r\ndaily see profligacy the characteristic of an entire family; and there are\r\nnames which have been rendered by misconduct synonymous with depravity.\r\nThis sad fact can only be attributed to natural temperament, whether it be\r\nsanguine or melancholic. It has been observed that our constitutions\r\nexercise a control over diseases, that modifies them in a peculiar manner.\r\nThe more acute the sensibility, the greater is the predisposition to\r\ninsanity. Warm and ungovernable passions will drive one female into all\r\nthe horrid excesses of nymphomania, while the timid hypochondriac and\r\nhysteric woman will gradually sink into a morose or a malevolent\r\ndespondency. Burton attributes daemonomania to other causes, and tells us\r\nthat the devil is so cunning that he is able to deceive the very elect;\r\nand, to compel them the more to stand in awe of him, he sends and cures\r\ndiseases, disquiets their minds, torments and terrifies their souls, to\r\nmake them adore him; and all his study, all his endeavour, is to divert\r\nthem from true religion to superstition; and because he is damned himself,\r\nand is in error, he would have all the world participate of his errors,\r\nand be damned with him.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various motives that induced the evil one to pay his sinister\r\nvisits to frail mortality, that of inflicting upon them a salutary, or a\r\nvexatious fustigation, is frequently recorded by the fathers and other\r\nwriters. It was more especially upon the backs of saints that this\r\ncastigation took place. St. Athanasius informs us that St. Anthony was\r\nfrequently flagellated by the devil. St. Jerome states that St. Hilarius\r\nwas often whipped in a similar manner; and he calls the devil \"a wanton\r\ngladiator,\" and thus describes his mode of punishment: \"Insidet dorso ejus\r\nfestivus gladiator; et latera calcibus, cervicem flagello verberans.\"\r\nGrimalaicus, a learned divine, confirms the fact in the following passage:\r\n\"Nonnumquam autem et aperta impugnatione grassantes, daemones humana\r\ncorpora verberant, sicut B. Antonio fecerant.\" St. Francis of Assisa\r\nreceived a dreadful flogging from the devil the very first night he came\r\nto Rome, which caused him to quit that city forthwith. Abbe Boileau's\r\nremarks on this circumstance savour not a little of impiety and\r\nfreethinking, for he says, \"It is not unlikely that, having met with a\r\ncolder reception than he judged his sanctity entitled him to, he thought\r\nproper to decamp immediately, and when he returned to his convent told the\r\nabove story to his brother monks.\" Howbeit, Abbe Boileau is no authority,\r\nand it is to be feared that, partaking of the satirical disposition of his\r\nbrother, he sacrificed piety to wit; for it is well known, beyond the\r\npower of sceptic doubts, that the aforesaid saint's assertion cannot\r\npossibly be impugned by proper believers. His power over the fiery\r\nelements was established; whereby he possessed the faculty of curing\r\nerysipelas, honoured by the appellation of St. Anthony's fire. In the like\r\nmanner St. Hubert cured hydrophobia, and St. John the epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, pleasing to know that it was not always that the beatified\r\nsuccumbed to these Satanic pranks, and many instances are recorded of the\r\ndevil's being worsted in these sacrilegious amusements, as fully appears\r\nin the history of the blessed Cornelia Juliana, in whose room, one day,\r\nsays her history, \"the other nuns heard a prodigious noise, which turned\r\nout to be a strife she had had with the devil, whom, after having laid\r\nhold of him, she fustigated most unmercifully; then, having him upon the\r\nground, she trampled upon him with her foot, and ridiculed him in the most\r\nbitter manner (_lacerabat sarcasmis_).\" This occurrence is\r\nincontrovertible, being affirmed by that learned and pious Jesuit,\r\nBartholomew Fisen.\r\n\r\nThis partiality of devils for flagellation can most probably be attributed\r\nto their horribly jealous disposition; for it is well known that the\r\nsaints took great delight in fustigating, not only those who offended\r\nthem, but their most faithful votaries. Flagellation was therefore the\r\nmost grateful punishment that could be inflicted to propitiate the\r\nbeatified; and we have several well-authenticated facts which prove that\r\nthe Virgin was frequently appeased by this practice. Under the pontificate\r\nof Sextus IV., a heterodox professor of divinity, who had written against\r\nthe tabernacle, was flogged publicly by a pious monk, to the great\r\nedification of the by-standers, more particularly the ladies. The\r\ndescription of this operation would lose materially by translation, I\r\ntherefore give it in the original. \"Apprehendens ipsum revolvit super ejus\r\ngenua; erat enim valde fortis. Elevatis itaque pannis, quia ille minister\r\ncontra sanctum Dei tabernaculum locutus fuerat, coepit cum palmis\r\npercutere _super quadrata tabernacula_ quae erant nuda, non enim habebat\r\n_femoralia vel antiphonam_; et quia ipse infamare voluerat beatam\r\nVirginem, allegando forsitan Aristotelem in libro priorum, iste praedicator\r\n_illum confutavit legendo in libro ejus posteriorum_: de hoc autem omnes\r\nqui aderant gaudebant. Tunc exclamavit _quaedam devota mulier_, dicens,\r\n'_Domine Praedicator, detis ei alios quatuor palmatus pro me_; et alia\r\npostmodum dixit, 'Detis ei etiam quatuor; sicque _multae aliae_ rogabant,\r\nita quod si illarum petitionibus satisfacere voluisset, per totum diem\r\naliud facere non potuisset.\"\r\n\r\nWe need not seek for similar instances of the mighty power of proper\r\nfustigation in foreign parts. The Annals of Wales record a singular\r\ninstance of the kind, which happened in the year 1188, as related by\r\nSilvester Gerald, in such a circumstantial manner that the most obdurate\r\nincredulity alone could doubt the fact:--\"On the other side of the river\r\nHumber,\" he says, \"in the parish of Hoeden, lived the rector of that\r\nchurch, with his concubine. This concubine, one day, sat rather\r\nimprudently on the tomb of St. Osanna, sister to King Osred, which was\r\nmade of wood, and raised above the ground in the shape of a seat: when she\r\nattempted to rise from that place, she stuck to the wood in such a manner\r\nthat she could not be parted from it, till, in the presence of the people\r\nwho flocked to see her, she had suffered her clothes to be torn from her,\r\nand had received a severe discipline on her naked body, and that too to a\r\ngreat effusion of blood, and with many tears and devout supplications on\r\nher part; which done, and after she had engaged to submit to further\r\npenitence, she was divinely released.\"\r\n\r\nIn this instance, as in many others, freedom from vulgar habiliments\r\nappears to have been considered as acceptable to Heaven; so much so,\r\nindeed, that the state of greater or lesser nudity has been commensurate\r\nwith the degree of the offence. The Cynic philosophers of Greece, among\r\nwhom Diogenes made himself most conspicuous, used to appear in public\r\nwithout a rag upon them. The Indian wise men, called Gymnosophists, or\r\nnaked sages, indulged in the same vagaries. In more modern times, the\r\nAdamites appeared in the simple condition of our first father. In the 13th\r\ncentury, a sect called _Les Turlupins_ (a denomination which appears to\r\nhave been an opprobrious nickname), perambulated France, disencumbered of\r\nvain accoutrements; and, in 1535, some Anabaptists made an excursion in\r\nAmsterdam in the condition in which they had quitted their baths, for\r\nwhich breach of decorum the impious burgomasters had them bastinadoed. We\r\nfurther read of one Friar Juniperus, a worthy Franciscan, who, according\r\nto history, \"entered the town of Viterboo, and, while he stood within the\r\ngate, he put his hose on his head, and his gown being tied round his neck\r\nin the shape of a load, he walked through the streets of the town, where\r\nhe suffered much abuse and maltreatment from the wicked inhabitants; and,\r\nstill in the same situation, he went to the convent of the brothers, who\r\nall exclaimed against him, but he cared little for them, _so holy was the\r\ngood little brother_ (_tam sanctus fuit iste fraticellus_).\"\r\n\r\nThe pranks of brother Juniper have been performed at sundry periods by\r\nvarious holy men. Are we not warranted in conceiving that these\r\nindividuals were daemonomaniacs? for surely the devil alone could have\r\ninspired them with such fancies, although Cardinal Damian defends the\r\npractice in the following terms, when speaking of the day of judgment:\r\n\"Then shall the sun lose its lustre, the moon shall be involved in\r\ndarkness; the stars shall fall from their places, and all the elements be\r\nconfounded together: of what service then will be to you those clothes and\r\ngarments with which you are now covered, and which you refuse to lay\r\naside, to submit to the exercise of penitence?\"\r\n\r\nIt must be remarked, in extenuation of these exhibitions, that they were\r\naccompanied by flagellation; which sometimes bore a close analogy to those\r\nof the Saturnalia and Lupercalia, and the discipline of the flagellants\r\nwas not always dissimilar to that of the Luperci.\r\n\r\nTo resume: Daemonomania may be considered the result of a morbid condition\r\nof the mind, and the dread of supernatural agency. The belief of an\r\nincarnation of the devil leads to the natural apprehension of his having\r\ntaken possession of our bodies, when a credulous creature fancies that he\r\nhas fallen into his snares, and forsaken the ways of the Omnipotent. This\r\nsad delusion has been admirably illustrated by Sir Walter Scott in his\r\ncurious and learned Demonology. \"It is, I think,\" says he, \"conclusive\r\nthat mankind, from a very early period, have their minds prepared for such\r\nevents (supernatural occurrences) by the consciousness of the existence of\r\na spiritual world. But imagination is apt to intrude its explanations and\r\ninferences founded on inadequate evidence. Sometimes our violent and\r\ninordinate passions, originating in sorrow for our friends, remorse for\r\nour crimes, our eagerness of patriotism, or our deep sense of\r\ndevotion,--these, or other violent excitements of a moral character, in\r\nthe visions of the night, or the rapt ecstasy of the day, persuade us that\r\nwe witness with our eyes and ears an actual instance of that supernatural\r\ncommunication, the possibility of which cannot be denied. At other times\r\nthe corporeal organs impose upon the mind, while the eye and the ear,\r\ndiseased, deranged, or misled, convey false impressions to the patient.\r\nVery often both the mental delusion and the physical deception exist at\r\nthe same time; and men's belief of the phenomena presented to them,\r\nhowever erroneously, by the senses, is the firmer and more readily\r\ngranted, that the physical impressions corresponded with the mental\r\nexcitement.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing observations we may venture to conclude, that an\r\nindividual who gives credence to apparitions will also believe in the\r\nincarnation of the devil. In both cases we infer that spiritual beings can\r\nassume corporeal forms; and, although we may not presume to question the\r\npossibility of such appearances when it may please the Omnipotent so to\r\nwill it, to believe in possession is actually to admit that the devil is a\r\nspiritual being endowed with specific attributes and powers, and acting\r\neither independently or with the consent of the Almighty. This admission\r\nwould to a certain extent border on the heresy of the Manicheans, who\r\nbelieved, with the heresiarch Cubricus, that there existed a good and an\r\nevil principle coeternal and independent of each other. We find in Holy\r\nWrit that indulgence was granted to Satan to visit the earth. But the\r\nperiod when miraculous power ceased, or rather was withdrawn from the\r\nchurch, is not determined. The Protestants bring it down beneath the\r\naccession of Constantine, while the Roman Catholic clergy still claim the\r\npower of producing or procuring supernatural manifestations when it suits\r\ntheir purpose; but, as Scott justly observes, it is alike inconsistent\r\nwith the common sense of either Protestant or Roman Catholic, that fiends\r\nshould be permitted to work marvels, which are no longer exhibited on the\r\npart of religion.\r\n\r\nCullen's opinion on this disease is worthy of remark. He says, \"I do not\r\nallow that there is any true daemonomania, because few people nowadays\r\nbelieve that demons have any power over our bodies or our minds; and, in\r\nmy opinion, the species recorded are either a species of melancholy or\r\nmania,--diseases falsely referred by the spectators to the power of\r\ndemons,--feigned diseases,--or diseases partly real or partly feigned.\"\r\n\r\nEsquirol, moreover, justly observes, that \"in modern times the punishments\r\nthat the priest denounces have ceased to influence the minds and the\r\nconduct of men, and governments have recourse to restraints of a\r\ndifferent kind. Many lunatics express now as much dread of the tribunals\r\nof justice, as they formerly entertained of the influence of stars and\r\ndemons.\"\r\n\r\nWe frequently meet with despondent monomaniacs labouring under the fatal\r\ndelusion of having forfeited all hopes of salvation, and being in fact\r\ninevitably doomed to perdition, but who are apparently of sound mind when\r\ntouching upon other subjects. The case of one Samuel Brown was peculiarly\r\nstriking. This unfortunate man, at a period when all his intellectual\r\nfaculties were in full vigour, fancied that his rational soul had\r\ngradually succumbed under divine displeasure, and that he solely enjoyed\r\nan animal life in common with brutes.\r\n\r\nEsquirol affirms that this form of lunacy is of rare occurrence, and that\r\nout of upwards of 20,000 insane persons whom he has observed, scarcely one\r\ncase of daemonomania could be found in a thousand, and these were amongst\r\nthe lowest and most uneducated classes of society. The most powerful charm\r\nto withstand the efforts of the evil spirit, is the following one\r\ngenerally made use of in Livonia.\r\n\r\n_Two eyes have seen thee--may three eyes deign to cast a favourable look\r\nupon thee, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLAGUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPestilential diseases have ever been considered a punishment inflicted on\r\nmankind for their manifold offences. The ancients deified the calamity,\r\nand viewed it in the light of an avenging god. In the Oedipus of\r\nSophocles, the chorus implore Minerva to preserve them from that divinity,\r\nwhich, without sword or buckler, strews the Theban streets with corpses,\r\nand is more invincible than Mars himself. Lucretius describes the plague\r\nof Athens as a holy fire,--\r\n\r\n  Et simul, ulceribus quasi inustis, omne rubore\r\n  Corpus, ut est, per membra _sacer_ quum diditur _ignis_.\r\n\r\nThe plague was known in an early era both to the Israelites and to the\r\nGreeks, and its ancient and modern histories have descended to us depicted\r\nin the most terrific colours, in a regular stream of Hebrew, Greek,\r\nArabic, and Roman writers, in most instances offering little variety from\r\nthe descriptions of neoteric observers.\r\n\r\nThe pestilences that visited the Israelites were, however, of a different\r\ncharacter. They were also considered as a Divine chastisement of the sins\r\nof that stiff-necked nation. This visitation, accurately described in Holy\r\nWrit, has led to the most curious disquisitions. Bryant has endeavoured by\r\nthe most recondite researches to give us the reasons why the Creator\r\nthought proper thus to visit his disobedient people. It has been truly\r\nobserved that the sublime is not far removed from the ridiculous; and it\r\nmay be said with equal correctness, that enthusiasm in religion too\r\nfrequently borders upon impiety. Bryant, in his erudite labour, has\r\nunhappily fallen into this extreme, in assigning human motives to the\r\ndecrees of the Deity. This matter is treated in so curious a manner that\r\nit will not be irrelevant to notice his bold assertions.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance, taking the language of the Exodus in the most\r\nliteral sense, he tells us that the river was turned into blood, _because_\r\nit was a punishment particularly well adapted to that blinded and\r\ninfatuated people, as a warning to the Israelites of the insufficiency of\r\nthe false gods that the Egyptians worshipped. They had rendered divine\r\nhomage to the Nile; and Herodotus informs us that the Persians held their\r\nrivers in the highest veneration; while the same worship obtained among\r\nthe Medes, the Parthians, and the Sarmatians. The Greeks adored the\r\nSpercheius, to whose god Peleus vowed the hair of his son; the laureated\r\nPeneus, the earth-born Achelous, and the loving Alpheus. For, although it\r\nmay be said that these streams were merely venerated as the symbols of\r\ntheir respective gods, it is possible that the Greeks might have fallen\r\ninto the same errors as the worshippers of saintly images in more modern\r\nand enlightened times. Therefore, says our learned author, there was a\r\ngreat propriety in the judgment brought upon this people by Moses. They\r\nmust have felt the utmost astonishment and horror when they beheld the\r\nsacred stream changed and polluted, and the divinity which they worshipped\r\nso shamefully soiled and debased. Moreover, he tells us that the Egyptian\r\npriests were particularly nice and delicate in their outward habits,\r\nmaking constant ablutions; and abhorred blood, or any stain of gore. In\r\nthis plague the fish that were in the river died, and the river stunk. Now\r\nthe priests and holy men not only never tasted fish, but looked upon them\r\nas deities. A city was built in honour of the god-fish, Oxyrunchus; the\r\nPhagrus[12] was worshipped at Syene, the Maeotis at Elephantis, and\r\nAntiphanes tells us that the Egyptians equally reverenced the eel.\r\n\r\nThe second plague were frogs, _because_, further saith our sapient\r\nauthority, they added to the stink of the land, as they \"died out of the\r\nhouses, out of the villages, and out of the fields, and were gathered\r\ntogether in heaps, and the land stunk,\" Exodus viii. 13, 14. Bryant\r\ncandidly confesses that he is rather uncertain if this reptile was an\r\nobject of reverence, or of abhorrence to the Egyptians; nevertheless, he\r\ndraws the conclusion that, as the ancients worshipped many deities of\r\ndread, and others that they despised, (such as Priapus, Fatua, Vacuna,\r\nCloacina,) Mephitis, or foul effluvia, was held in religious awe,--and, to\r\nuse his own expressions, since Mephitis \"signified stink in the abstract,\"\r\nand had a temple at Cremona, the pestilential emanation from the dead\r\nfrogs might have been considered as entitled to some reverence.[13]\r\nPlutarch tells us that the frog was an emblem of the sun in Egypt, and\r\nthat the brazen palm-tree at Delphi had many of these animals engraved on\r\nits basis. On the Bembine table we find it sitting upon the lotus, a\r\ncircumstance observed in various ancient gems; the water-lily being,\r\nperhaps, congenial to this aquatic tribe, which were denominated the\r\nattendants of the deities of streams and fountains. It is also alleged\r\nthat the frog was deemed an emblem of Apollo and Osiris, from its habit of\r\ninflation, which was looked upon as being typical of inspiration. That\r\nfrogs were considered as evil symbols further appears in the Apocalypse,\r\nwhere we find that \"three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth\r\nof the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of\r\nthe false prophet; they are the spirits of devils working miracles.\"\r\n\r\nThe third plague was lice, _because_ the Egyptian priests affected great\r\nexternal purity, wore linen under their woollen garments, and shaved their\r\nheads, according to Herodotus, every third day, to prevent any louse, or\r\nany other detestable object, from finding a comfortable shelter. Some\r\nscholastics have ventured to insinuate that this insect was a species of\r\ngnat; but St. Jerome and Origen very properly observe that this would have\r\nbeen a presumptious anticipation of the plague of flies, which constituted\r\nthe _fourth_ visitation, _because_ flies were also held sacred by the\r\nEgyptians, and were worshipped under the name of _Achon_, _Acoron_, and\r\n_Zebub_, more particularly in the city of _Acaron_ or _Accoron_. Baal was\r\nthe god of flies, and the fly was worshipped at _Ekron_, where it was\r\ncalled _Baal-ze-bub_,--hence _Belzebub_.\r\n\r\nThe next plague was the murrain of beasts; _because_ it was necessary that\r\nthe Israelites should not only see that the cattle of the Egyptians were\r\nall infected, while theirs were exempted from the evil; but that their\r\nvery living symbol of the bull Apis, in whom the soul of Osiris had taken\r\nup its dwelling, was affected with epizooty in common with other herds of\r\nhorned deities, who were called _Dii Stercorei_; though it appears that\r\nthe ass and the camel were involved in the same calamity.\r\n\r\nOur commentator attempts to account for the sixth plague of boils and\r\nblains with equal ingenuity. He affirms that this cruel disorder was sent\r\namong the Egyptians to show the Israelites that the medical men to whom\r\nthey attributed divine powers, could neither cure nor alleviate the\r\ndisease. The science of medicine bequeathed by Isis to her son Orus was of\r\nno avail, and the learned records of Tosorthrus yielded no information. In\r\nvain did their leeches search their cryptae and sacred caverns, or consult\r\ntheir mystic obelisks, which, according to Manetho, were inscribed with\r\nthe aphorisms of medical experience; their physicians only increased the\r\nnumber of the _botches_ of the land. The Scriptures state that this\r\npestilential malady was produced by the ashes that Aaron and Moses\r\nscattered up towards heaven to be wafted over the country. Bryant also\r\naccounts for this circumstance, and attributes this method of extending\r\nthe calamity to the barbarous practice of the Egyptians of burning human\r\nvictims and scattering the ashes in the air, in a like manner to\r\npropitiate their gods.\r\n\r\nThe fall of rain, hail, fire, and thunder, that constituted the seventh\r\nplague, was a chastisement inflicted on the worshippers of these supposed\r\nelements. Their Isis presided over the waters, and Osiris and Hephaistus\r\ngoverned fire. Moreover the flax was smitten, whereby the Egyptians were\r\ndeprived of the means of making linen, the finest of which was their boast\r\nand their pride. The barley was also destroyed, and they had no materials\r\nfor brewing their favourite potation, barley-wine; a species of beer which\r\nconstituted their chief beverage when the waters of the Nile were turbid\r\nand not potable.[14]\r\n\r\nBut, according to Jacob Bryant, this destruction was not deemed\r\nsufficient, since the fecundity of Egypt would soon have replenished their\r\ngranaries, manufactures, and breweries; therefore locusts were sent to\r\ndevour every thing that the former devastation had spared; and this plague\r\nwas a punishment of their belief that Hercules and Apollo had the power of\r\ncontrolling these ravenous insects, which were called _Parnopes_ and\r\n_Cornopes_, whence Apollo was named _Parnopius_, and Hercules _Cornopion_.\r\nIt also appears that the grasshoppers, or _cicadae_, were venerated, both\r\nas sacred and musical; and the Athenians wore golden ones in their hair,\r\nto denote the antiquity of their race of earth-born breed.\r\n\r\nNow it is somewhat singular, that while our ingenious author makes such\r\nlearned inquiries to account for the motives that induced God thus to\r\nvisit the Egyptians, he does not venture to assign motives for similar\r\ncalamities which befel other nations and countries; although his\r\nresearches on the subject are so curious and interesting, that they\r\ndeserve insertion.\r\n\r\nThe following is the account given by Beauplam of the destructive inroad\r\nof these devourers in the Ukraine:--\"Next to the flies, let us talk of the\r\ngrasshoppers or locusts, which here are so numerous, that they put one in\r\nmind of the scourge of God sent upon Egypt when he punished Pharaoh. These\r\ncreatures do not only come in legions, but in whole clouds, five or six\r\nleagues in length, and two or three in breadth, eating up all sorts of\r\ngrain or grass, so that wheresoever they come, in less than two hours they\r\ncrop all they can find, which causes great scarcity of provisions. It is\r\nnot easy to express their numbers, for all the air is full and darkened;\r\nand I cannot better represent their flight to you, than by comparing it to\r\nthe flakes of snow driven by the wind in cloudy weather; and when they\r\nalight to feed, the plains are all covered. They make a murmuring noise as\r\nthey eat, and in less than two hours they devour all close to the ground;\r\nthen rising, they suffer themselves to be carried away by the wind. When\r\nthey fly, though the sun shines never so bright, the air is no lighter\r\nthan when most clouded. In June 1646, having stayed in a new town called\r\nNovogorod, I was astonished to see so vast a multitude. They were hatched\r\nhere last spring; and being as yet scarcely able to fly, the ground was\r\nall covered, and the air so full of them, that I could not eat in my\r\nchamber without a candle, all the houses being full of them, even the\r\nstables, barns, chambers, garrets, cellars, &c. I have seen at night, when\r\nthey sit to rest themselves, that the roads have been four inches thick of\r\nthem, one upon another. By the wheels of the carts and the feet of our\r\nhorses bruising these creatures, there came from them such a stink, as\r\nnot only offended the nose but the brain. I was not able to endure the\r\nstench, but was forced to wash my nose with vinegar, and to hold a\r\nhandkerchief dipped in it to my nostrils perpetually. These vermin\r\nincrease and multiply thus: they generate in October, and with their tails\r\nmake a hole in the ground, and having laid three hundred eggs in it, and\r\ncovered them with their feet, die; for they never live above six months\r\nand a half. And though the rains should come, they would not destroy the\r\neggs; nor does the frost, never so sharp, hurt them. But they continue to\r\nthe spring, which is about mid-April; when the sun warming the earth, they\r\nare hatched, and leap about, being six weeks old before they can fly; when\r\nstronger, and able to fly, they go wherever the wind carries them. If it\r\nshould happen that a north-east wind prevails, it carries them all into\r\nthe black sea; but if the wind blows from any other quarter, they go into\r\nsome other country to do mischief. I have been told by persons who\r\nunderstand the languages well, that the words _Boze Guion_, which mean the\r\nscourge of God, are written in Chaldee characters upon their wings.\"\r\n\r\nNorden mentions that there were supposed to be hieroglyphic marks upon the\r\nheads of these insects. Such was the pestilential scourge of the Ukraine;\r\nalthough I do not apprehend that its inhabitants ever worshipped\r\n_Parnopius_ or _Cornopion_, or decorated their filthy heads with golden\r\ngrasshoppers. Other regions were occasionally visited by these insects.\r\nLudolphus, in speaking of Ethiopia, says, \"But much more pernicious than\r\nthese (the numerous serpents) are the locusts, which do not frequent the\r\ndesert and sandy places, like the serpents, but the places best manured,\r\nand orchards laden with fruit. They appear in prodigious multitudes, like\r\na cloud which obscures the sun; nor plants, nor trees, nor shrubs appear\r\nuntouched, and wherever they feed, what is left appears as it were parched\r\nwith fire. A general mortality ensues; and regions lie waste for years.\"\r\n\r\nFrancis Alvarez thus speaks of the same calamity in the country of Prester\r\nJohn. \"In this country, and in all the dominions of Prete Janni, there is\r\na very great and horrible plague: this arises from an innumerable number\r\nof locusts, which eat and consume all the corn and the trees. And the\r\nnumber of these creatures is so great as to be incredible, and with their\r\nnumbers they cover the earth, and fill the air in such wise, that it is a\r\nhard matter to see the sun. And if the damage they do were general through\r\nall the provinces, the people would perish with famine. But one year they\r\ndestroy one province, sometimes two or three of the provinces; and\r\nwherever they go the country remaineth more ruined and destroyed than if\r\nit had been set on fire.\" The author adds, that he exorcised them upon\r\ntheir invading a district in which he resided, when they all made off; but\r\nin the mean time, he adds, \"there arose a great storm and thunder towards\r\nthe sea, which came right against them. It lasted three hours, with an\r\nexceeding great shower and tempest. It was a dreadful thing to behold the\r\ndead locusts, (whom, by the way he had exorcised,) which we measured to be\r\nabove two fathoms high upon the banks of the rivers.\"\r\n\r\nBarbot, in describing Upper Guinea, tells us that \"famines are some years\r\noccasioned by the dreadful swarms of grasshoppers or locusts, which come\r\nfrom the eastward, and spread all over the country in such prodigious\r\nmultitudes, that they darken the air, passing over our heads like a mighty\r\ncloud.\"\r\n\r\nOrosius states that in the consulship of Marcus Plautius Hypsaeus and\r\nMarcus Fulvius Flaccus, A.R. 628, Africa was desolated by a swarm of these\r\ninsects, which for a while were supported in the air, but were ultimately\r\ncast into the sea. \"After this,\" he adds, \"the surf threw up upon that\r\nlong extended coast such numerous heaps of their dead and corrupted\r\nbodies, that there ensued from putrefaction a most unsupportable and\r\npoisonous stench. This soon brought on a pestilence, which affected every\r\nspecies of animals, so that all birds, and sheep, and cattle, also the\r\nwild beasts of the field died, and their carcases being soon rendered\r\nputrid by the foulness of the air, added greatly to the general\r\ncorruption. In respect to men, it is impossible, without horror, to\r\ndescribe the shocking devastation. In Numidia, where at the time Micipsa\r\nwas king, eighty thousand persons perished. Upon that part of the\r\nsea-coast which bordered upon the regions of Carthage and Utica, the\r\nnumber of those carried off by this pestilence is said to have been two\r\nhundred thousand.\"\r\n\r\nNow when man in all his proud ignorance dares to assume the power of\r\ncanvassing the acts of the Almighty, and to attribute to his inscrutable\r\nwill human motives, which generally arise from mortal frailty, he might as\r\nwell endeavour to account for similar casualties which visited other\r\nnations than the Egyptians, and seek for the causes of the scourges of\r\nCarthage, Ethiopia, and Tartary. It is grievous to see the intellectual\r\nfaculties of man perverted in such idle, one might venture to say, in such\r\nimpious researches. It is strange that the learned Bryant did not\r\nassociate the death of the first-born with ideas of primogeniture!\r\n\r\nThe ninth plague of darkness he attributes to the prevalence of the\r\nworship of the sun, under the title of Osiris, Ammon, Orus, Isis, and the\r\nlike. _Because_ the Egyptians, the Ethiopians, Persians, Phoenicians,\r\nSyrians, Rhodians, and various other nations, considered themselves\r\nHeliadae, or descendants of the sun. \"What, then, can be more reasonable,\"\r\ncontinues our antiquary, \"than for a people who thus abused their\r\nfaculties, who raised to themselves a god of Day, their Osiris, and\r\ninstead of that intellectual light, the wisdom of the Almighty,\r\nsubstituted a created and inanimate element as a just object of\r\nworship,--what could be more apposite than for people of this cast to be\r\ndoomed to a judicial and temporary darkness?\" Unfortunately, in the very\r\nnext paragraph we are told that the Egyptians showed an equal reverence to\r\nnight and darkness: obscurity, therefore, was only replacing one false god\r\nby another. They paid a religious regard to the _mugall_, a kind of mole,\r\non account of its supposed blindness; and night was conceived more sacred\r\nthan day, from its greater antiquity, since, according to the Phoenician\r\ntheology, the wind _Copias_ and his wife _Baan_ were esteemed the same as\r\nnight, and were the authors of the first beings. In the poems of Orpheus,\r\nNight is considered as the creative principle; and in the Orphic hymns we\r\nfind Night invoked as \"the parent of gods and men, and the origin of all\r\nthings.\"\r\n\r\nThis attempt to show an analogy between the crimes and sins of the\r\nEgyptians and the punishment they received, is too curious to be\r\noverlooked. The mania of seeking for the cause of every thing, reminds one\r\nof a singular character in Trinity College, Dublin, formerly well known,\r\nwho invariably gave a reason for every direction he thought proper to\r\nissue; and he was once heard to address a servant in the following words:\r\n\"Pat, put a cover upon that mutton. It is not for the purpose of keeping\r\nit hot, _because_ it is cold, but it is _because_ I do not wish the flies\r\nto get at it, _because_ fly-blown meat is both unpleasant to the taste and\r\ninjurious to the health.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears probable that the plague originated in Egypt. From time\r\nimmemorial to the present day the lower provinces have been subject to\r\nthis cruel scourge. Wars, intestine commotions, and misrule have too\r\nfrequently prevented the local authorities from paying proper attention to\r\nmeasures of public salubrity. Herodotus tells us, that when he was at\r\nMemphis, Egypt was just liberated from a long-protracted war, during\r\nwhich political economy had been neglected, canals had been abandoned and\r\nchoked up, and the frontiers of the land were infested with banditti,\r\nwhile the interior was desolated by pestilential disorders. My much\r\nesteemed friend Baron Larrey, in his valuable work upon Egypt, has given a\r\ntopographical description of the country; and the influence that the\r\nseasons exercise upon it, must be evident. He informs us that after the\r\nspring equinox, and especially towards the beginning of June, the\r\nsoutherly winds are prevalent for about fifty days. Their scorching\r\ninfluence is experienced for upwards of four hours, while they waft with\r\nfatal rapidity putrid emanations exhaled by animal and vegetable bodies\r\ndecomposed in the lakes formed by the receding waters of the Nile. From\r\nvarious observations it has been concluded that the plague is both an\r\nendemic and contagious disease in Lower Egypt, but simply contagious in\r\nUpper Egypt, Syria, the other Turkish provinces, and Europe. No account of\r\nthe plague in Abyssinia, Sennaar, or the interior of Africa, is given by\r\nany traveller.\r\n\r\nThe most fatal European plagues were probably those that desolated London\r\nin 1664, and Marseilles in 1720. The accounts of these fearful visitations\r\nare as curious as they are appalling. In London it broke out in the\r\nbeginning of December, when two foreigners (Frenchmen it was reported)\r\ndied of this disorder in Long-Acre, near Drury Lane. The cold weather and\r\nfrost that followed, seemed to check its progress, until the month of\r\nApril, when it appeared with intensity in the parishes of St. Andrew,\r\nHolborn, and St. Clement Danes. In May, the parish of St. Giles buried a\r\ngreat number. Wood Street, Fenchurch Street, and Crooked Lane, were soon\r\nvisited, until terror was so general, that crowds of inhabitants\r\npanic-struck, on foot, on horse, in coaches, waggons, and carts, were\r\nthronging Broad Street and Whitechapel, fleeing from the calamity. To such\r\nan extent was migration carried, that not a horse could be bought or\r\nhired. Many fugitives, fearful of stopping at inns, carried tents to lie\r\nin the fields, and people moved in the centre of the streets, in dread of\r\ncoming into contact with others sallying forth from their houses. During\r\nthis state of universal panic, it may be easily imagined that hypocrisy\r\nand roguery were busily employed in increasing the evil, at the expense of\r\nthe credulous. Pretended wizards and cunning people affirmed that a comet\r\nhad appeared several months previous to the increase of the malady, as a\r\nsimilar meteor had visited London before the great fire; only the fire\r\ncomet was bright and sparkling, and the plague comet was dull, and of a\r\nlanguid colour. Lilly's Almanac and Gadbury's Astrological Predictions\r\nwere in general demand; while pamphlets, entitled \"Come out of her, my\r\npeople, lest you be partakers of her plagues,\" \"Fair Warning,\" and\r\n\"Britain's Remembrancer,\" were eagerly circulated, as they denounced the\r\nutter ruin of the city. One of these prophets ran about the streets,\r\nwithout the encumbrance of any garment, roaring out, \"Yet forty days, and\r\nLondon shall be destroyed;\" while another, equally divested of raiment,\r\nbellowed out, \"Oh! the great and the dreadful God!\" Some asserted that\r\nthey had seen a hand with a flaming sword coming out of the clouds, while\r\nothers beheld hearses and coffins floating in the air.\r\n\r\nThe following is a quaint narrative of these absurdities: \"One time before\r\nthe plague was begun, I think it was in March, seeing a crowd of people in\r\nthe street, I joined with them to satisfy my curiosity, and I found them\r\nall staring up in the air to see what a woman told them appeared plain to\r\nher, which was an angel clothed in white, with a fiery sword in his hand,\r\nwaving it and brandishing it over his head. She described every part of\r\nthe figure to the life, showed them the motions and the form; and the poor\r\npeople came into it readily. 'Yes, I see it all plainly,' says one;\r\n'there's the sword as plain as can be.' Another saw his very face, and\r\ncried out, 'What a glorious creature he was!' One saw one thing, and one\r\nanother. I looked as earnestly as the rest, and said I could see nothing\r\nbut a cloud. However, the woman turned from me; called me a profane fellow\r\nand a scoffer; told me that it was a time of God's anger, and dreadful\r\njudgments were approaching, and that despisers such as I should _wonder\r\nand perish_. Another encounter I had in the open day also, in going\r\nthrough a narrow passage from Petty-France into Bishopsgate churchyard. In\r\nthis narrow passage stands a man looking through between the palisadoes\r\ninto the burying-place, and he was pointing now to one place, then to\r\nanother, and affirming that he saw a ghost walking upon such a\r\ngrave-stone; he described the shape, the posture, and the movement of it\r\nso exactly, crying on a sudden, 'There it is--now it comes this way--now\r\n'tis turned back!' till at length he persuaded the people into so firm a\r\nbelief of it, that they fancied they saw it; and thus he came every day,\r\nmaking a strange hubbub, till Bishopsgate clock struck eleven, and then\r\nthe ghost would start and disappear on a sudden.\"\r\n\r\nSuch sanctimonious tricks are historical. Don Bernal Dias del Castello\r\ntells us, in his account of the Mexican conquest, that St. Jago appeared\r\nin the van of the army, mounted on a white horse, and leading the troops\r\non to victory. He frankly owns that he did not see this blessed vision;\r\nnay, that a cavalier, by name Francisco de Morla, mounted on a chestnut\r\nsteed, was fighting in the very place where the patron of Spain was said\r\nto have appeared; but, instead of drawing the natural conclusion, that the\r\nwhole business was got up as an illusion, he devoutly exclaims, \"Sinner\r\nthat I was, what am I that I should have been permitted to behold the\r\nblessed apostle!\"\r\n\r\nThese impostures remind us of the story of the wag who, fixing his eyes\r\nupon the lion over Northumberland House, exclaimed, \"By heaven! it\r\nwags--it wags!\" and contrived by these means to collect an immense mob in\r\nthe street, many of whom swore that they did absolutely see the lion\r\nwagging his tail.\r\n\r\nCrowds of pretended fortune-tellers, and astrologers and cunning men, were\r\nsoon in good business, and their trade became so generally practised, that\r\nthey had signs denoting their profession over their doors, with\r\ninscriptions announcing, \"Here lives a fortune-teller,\"--\"Here you may\r\nhave your nativity cast;\" and the head of Friar Bacon, Mother Shipton, or\r\nMerlin, were their usual signs: and if any unfortunate man of grave\r\nappearance, and wearing a black cloak, went abroad, he was immediately\r\nassailed by the mob as a necromancer, and supplicated to reveal futurity.\r\nAt such a period, it may be easily imagined that quacks were not satisfied\r\nwith mere gleanings; and _infallible pills_, _never-failing\r\npreservatives_, _sovereign cordials_, and _incomparable drinks_, against\r\nthe plague, were announced in every possible manner; and _universal\r\nremedies_, _the only true plague-water_, and _the royal antidote_, became\r\nthemes of universal discourse. An eminent _High_ Dutch physician, newly\r\ncome over from Holland, where he resided during all the time of the\r\nplague,--an Italian gentlewoman, having a choice secret to prevent\r\ninfection, and that did wonders in a plague that destroyed twenty thousand\r\npeople a-day, were announced by bills at every corner.\r\n\r\nOne ingenious mountebank realized a fortune by announcing _that he gave\r\nadvice to the poor for nothing_: crowds flocked to consult him; but he\r\ntook half-a-crown for his remedy, on the plea that, although his advice\r\nwas given gratis, he was obliged to sell his physic. While these\r\nspeculations were going on, all \"plays, bear-baiting, games, singing of\r\nballads, and buckler-play,\" were prohibited; all feasting, \"particularly\r\nby the companies of this city,\" was punished; watchmen guarded the doors\r\nof the pestiferated, to prevent their egress, and a red cross was painted\r\non their houses. The inhabitants, thus shut up to suffer the pangs of\r\nstarvation in addition to those of pestilence, made the best of their way\r\nout of their prison by every possible stratagem and bribery. While fervent\r\nprayers and loud ejaculations for mercy were heard amongst distracted\r\nfamilies, the most offensive blasphemy and ribaldry prevailed amongst the\r\ngravediggers, dead-cart drivers, and their wanton companions. If any one\r\nventured to rebuke them, he was asked, with a volley of oaths, \"what\r\nbusiness he had to be alive, when so many better fellows were shovelled in\r\ntheir graves?\" to which was added a salutary recommendation to go home and\r\npray, until the dead-cart called for him. The watchmen got their share of\r\nill-usage and abuse.\r\n\r\nAll the guards had been marched out of town, with the exception of small\r\ndetachments at Whitehall and the Tower. Robbery of every description was\r\nof course in full vigour, and every vice indulged in with impunity, while\r\ndespair drove many to madness and suicide,--several individuals rushing\r\nnaked out of their houses, and running to the river to drown themselves if\r\nnot stopped by the watch. People fell dead while making purchases of\r\nprovisions in the market; where, instead of receiving the meat from the\r\nbutcher's hands, each buyer unhooked his purchase, and paid for it by\r\nthrowing the value in a vessel filled with vinegar. Mothers destroyed\r\ntheir children, and nurses smothered their patients, while the bedclothes\r\nwere stolen from the couch of the dead.\r\n\r\nAmong the curious anecdotes of the time, the following is worth insertion:\r\n\"A neighbour of mine, having some money owing to him from a shopkeeper in\r\nWhitecross-street, sent his apprentice, a youth of eighteen years of age,\r\nto get the money; he came to the door, and finding it shut, knocked pretty\r\nhard until he heard somebody coming down stairs. At length the man of the\r\nhouse came to the door; he had on his breeches or drawers, a yellow\r\nflannel waistcoat, no stockings, and a pair of slipt shoes, a white cap on\r\nhis head, and death in his face. When he opened the door, he said, 'What\r\ndo you disturb me thus for?'--'I come from such a one, my master,' replied\r\nthe boy, 'to ask for the money you owe him.'--'Very well, my child,'\r\nreturns the living ghost; 'call as you go by at Cripple-gate church, and\r\nbid them toll the bell.' So saying, he went up stairs again, and died the\r\nsame hour.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of the piper is founded on fact. This poor fellow having made\r\nmerry in a public-house in Coleman-street, fell fast asleep under a stall\r\nnear London Wall, Cripplegate; the under-sexton of St. Stephen's, one John\r\nHayward, was going his rounds with his dead-cart, when he espied the\r\npiper, and, conceiving him to be a dead man, tumbled him on his heap of\r\ncorpses, till, arrived at the burying-pit at Mount Hill, as they were\r\nabout shooting the cart, the musician awoke, and, to the utter terror of\r\nthe sexton and his comrades, began to set up his pipes.\r\n\r\nThe following relation of a case of grief is rather remarkable. \"A man was\r\nso much affected by the death of all his relations, and overcome with the\r\npressure upon his spirits, that by degrees his head sunk into his body so\r\nbetween his shoulders, that the crown of his head was very little seen\r\nabove the bones of his shoulders, and, by degrees losing both voice and\r\nsense, his face looking forward, lay against his collar-bone, and could\r\nnot be kept up any otherwise unless held up by the hands of other people;\r\nand the poor man never came to himself again, but languished near a year\r\nin this condition, and died.\" This was _depression_ with a vengeance!\r\n\r\nSome of these unfortunate victims of the pestilential disease seem to have\r\nhad poetical inspirations, for one of two men who had fled to the country\r\nwas found dead with the following inscription cut out with his knife on a\r\nwooden gate near him:\r\n\r\n       OmIsErY\r\n  WE. BoTH ShaLL. DyE\r\n      WoE. WoE:\r\n\r\nand our historian, who fortunately escaped the calamity, terminates his\r\nwork with the following lines:\r\n\r\n  A dreadful plague in London was\r\n    In the year sixty-five,\r\n  Which swept an hundred thousand souls\r\n    Away; yet I alive.\r\n\r\nAstrologers were of opinion that the plague of London arose from a\r\nconjunction of Saturn and Jupiter in Sagittarius on the tenth of October,\r\nor from a conjunction of Saturn and Mars in the same sign on the twelfth\r\nof November.[15]\r\n\r\nGreat as the mortality was during this affliction, the history of various\r\nother pestilences in foreign countries presents as melancholy a result. In\r\nMoscow, the plague introduced by the Turkish army carried off 22,000\r\ninhabitants in a single month, and sometimes 12,000 in twenty-four hours.\r\nIn Morocco, the mortality amounted to 1000 daily; in Old and New Fez, to\r\n1500; in Terodant to 800. The total loss sustained in these cities and in\r\nthe Mogadore was estimated at 124,500 souls.\r\n\r\nThe black pestilence of the fourteenth century also caused the most\r\nterrific ravages in England. It has been supposed to have borne some\r\nresemblance to the cholera, but that is not the case; it derived its name\r\nfrom the dark livid colour of the spots and boils that broke out upon the\r\npatient's body. Like the cholera, the fatal disease appeared to have\r\nfollowed a regular route in its destructive progress; but it did not, like\r\nthe cholera, advance westward, although like that fearful visitation it\r\nappears to have originated in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe black pestilence descended along the Caucasus to the shores of the\r\nMediterranean, and instead of entering Europe through Russia, first spread\r\nover the south, and after devastating the rest of Europe penetrated into\r\nthat country. It followed the caravan, which came from China across\r\nCentral Asia, until it reached the shores of the Black Sea; thence it was\r\nconveyed by ships to Constantinople, the centre of commercial intercourse\r\nbetween Asia, Europe, and Africa. In 1347 it reached Sicily and some of\r\nthe maritime cities of Italy and Marseilles. During the following year it\r\nspread over the northern part of Italy, France, Germany, and England. The\r\nnorthern kingdom of Europe was invaded by it in 1349, and finally Russia\r\nin 1351,--four years after it had appeared in Constantinople.\r\n\r\nThe following estimate of deaths was considered far below the actual\r\nnumber of victims:\r\n\r\n  Florence lost                 60,000 inhabitants\r\n  Venice     \"                  10,000      \"\r\n  Marseilles \"  in one month    56,000      \"\r\n  Paris      \"        \"         50,000      \"\r\n  Avignon    \"        \"         60,000      \"\r\n  Strasburg  \"        \"         16,000      \"\r\n  Basle      \"        \"         14,000      \"\r\n  Erfurth    \"        \"         16,000      \"\r\n  London     \"        \"        100,000      \"\r\n  Norwich    \"        \"         50,000      \"\r\n\r\nHecker states that this pestilence was preceded by great commotion in the\r\ninterior of the globe. About 1333, several earthquakes and volcanic\r\neruptions did considerable injury in upper Asia, while in the same year,\r\nGreece, Italy, France, and Germany suffered under similar disasters. The\r\nharvests were swept away by inundations, and clouds of locusts destroyed\r\nall that the floods had spared, while dense masses of offensive insects\r\nstrewed the land.\r\n\r\nAs in the recent invasion of cholera, the populace attributed this scourge\r\nto poison and to the Jews, and these hapless beings were persecuted and\r\ndestroyed wherever they could be found. In Mayence, after vainly\r\nattempting to defend themselves, they shut themselves up in their\r\nquarters, where 1200 of them were burnt to death. The only asylum found by\r\nthem was Lithuania where Casimir afforded them protection; and it is\r\nperhaps owing to this circumstance that so many Jewish families are still\r\nto be found in Poland.\r\n\r\nA curious monumental record of the plague is to be seen at Eyam, an\r\ninsignificant village in Derbyshire, to the eastward of Tideswell. It is\r\nan ancient stone cross of curious form and workmanship, erroneously stated\r\nto have been erected to commemorate the extinction of the pestilence which\r\nwas supposed to have been brought there in a bag of woollen clothes, sent\r\nfrom London to a tailor of the place. The hamlet was soon infected, and\r\nits panic-struck inhabitants fled in every direction, scattering death in\r\ntheir flight, until driven back within their boundaries. During the\r\nprevalence of this scourge, tradition makes honourable mention of the\r\nrector of the parish, William Mompesson. Determined not to abandon his\r\nflock in the hour of need, he never quitted the devoted spot. In vain he\r\nentreated his wife to remove from the pestilential sphere of action--she\r\nwould not leave him. Eyam was now cut off from all communication with the\r\nneighbourhood. The worthy clergyman addressed the Earl of Devonshire, then\r\nresiding at Chatsworth, acquainting him with his resolution, and\r\nrequesting that regular supplies of provisions might be duly placed in\r\ncertain points of the adjacent hills. If this request was attended to, he\r\npledged himself that none of his parishioners should transgress a given\r\nboundary. Troughs and wells, which are still there, were dug to secure\r\nwater supplied by a stream, which to this day bears the hallowed name of\r\n_Mompesson brook_. The following account of this benevolent pastor's\r\nconduct in this emergency is not without interest:\r\n\r\n\"Aware that any assemblage of people breathing the same air under a\r\nconfined roof, and coming into immediate contact with each other, must be\r\nhighly dangerous, he closed the door of the church, availing himself of a\r\nnobler substitute \"not made with hands,\"--a rock that projected from the\r\nside of a steep hill, near the village, in a deep and narrow dingle. This\r\nrock is excavated through in different directions, the arches being from\r\n12 to 19 feet high. In the middle of this romantic dell, from one of these\r\nnatural porticoes, three times a week did he read prayers, and twice on\r\nSundays did he address to his death-stricken congregation, the words of\r\neternal life. By his own immediate directions, they arranged themselves on\r\nthe declivity near the bottom, at the distance of a yard asunder. This\r\nspot is deservedly still held sacred, and known by the name of _Cucklet\r\nchurch_.\"\r\n\r\nThe following letter from this worthy clergyman, dated 20th November,\r\n1666, energetically describes the calamity:\r\n\r\n\"The condition of this place has been so sad, that I persuaded myself it\r\ndid exceed all history and example. I may truly say that our place has\r\nbecome a Golgotha--the place of a skull; and had there not been a small\r\nremnant of us left, we had been as Sodom, and been made like unto\r\nGomorrha; my ears never heard, my eyes never beheld such ghastly\r\nspectacles. Now, blessed be God, all our fears are over, for none have\r\ndied of the infection since the 11th of October, and all the pesthouses\r\nhave been long empty. I meant, God willing, to spend most of this week in\r\nseeing all woollen clothes fumed and purified, as well for the\r\nsatisfaction as the safety of the country.\r\n\r\n\"Here has been such burning of goods, that the like I think was never\r\nknown. I have scarcely left myself apparel to shelter my body from the\r\ncold, and have wasted more than needed, merely for example. As for my\r\npart, I cannot say that I had ever been in better health than during the\r\ntime of this dreadful visitation, neither can I say that I have had any\r\nsymptoms of the disease.\"\r\n\r\nDuring a considerable time the benevolent man and his wife had escaped the\r\nmalady, but at last his excellent wife was smitten, and died in his arms\r\nat the age of 27--far from her children, who had been sent away at the\r\ncommencement of the invasion.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, Malta was visited with this fatal malady; when the scenes of the\r\nplague that desolated the island in the sixteenth century were renewed,\r\nnotwithstanding all the sanitary precautions adopted by various\r\ngovernments since that period.\r\n\r\nCount Ciantar in his \"_Malta illustrata_,\" gives an interesting account of\r\nthe introduction of the plague at four different periods in that island.\r\nThe first was in 1592; when, in the month of May, four galleys belonging\r\nto the Grand Duke of Tuscany, entered the port to procure pilots for the\r\nservice. By permission of the Grand Master, Cardinal Verclula, a pilot was\r\nobtained, and the vessels steered towards the Egyptian coast. In the\r\nvicinity of Alexandria, they captured a galley bound to Constantinople,\r\nhaving on board 150 Turks. On hearing that the plague was raging at\r\nAlexandria, they returned to Malta with their prize, which was discovered\r\nto be infected, and for the first time the plague was brought into the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe second plague broke out in 1623, and originated in the house of Paulus\r\nEmilius Ramadus, guardian of the port. But the whole of the infected\r\npersons having been immediately sent to the Lazaretto, the progress of the\r\ndisease was checked, and it only carried off forty-five persons.\r\n\r\nThe third plague took place in 1633, and broke out at the Marina gate,\r\nwhere vessels from the Levant usually anchored. The proprietor of a house\r\nin that quarter, having had some communication with one of these ships,\r\ncontracted the disease, and infected his sister, who resided in the\r\ncountry at Casal Zeitun, and shortly after the whole family was attacked,\r\ntheir speedy removal to the Lazaretto, however arrested the disease.\r\n\r\nThe fourth appearance of this malady in Malta, was far more destructive\r\nthan it had been in the preceding years, even in 1675, and it continued\r\nits ravages for seven months. This circumstance has been attributed to a\r\ndifference of opinion that prevailed among the members of the\r\ncommissioners appointed to take the necessary steps for checking the\r\nprogress of the disease. It appears that doubts were entertained as to the\r\nnature of the malady, hence the requisite precautions were not enforced;\r\nand instead of separating the diseased from the healthy part of the\r\ncommunity, with the utmost rigour, prayers were put up, vows and offerings\r\nwere made, and processions paraded the streets, nor it was not until the\r\nGrand Master had sent to France for medical aid, that the scourge was\r\nmitigated. On their arrival the first steps adopted by these physicians\r\nwas to confine the inhabitants to their homes, and to remove the sick to\r\nthe Lazaret. The ravages of the disease must have been very great, since\r\nout of a population of about 60,000, there died in Valetta 4000, in Burgo\r\n1800, Senglen 2000, Burmola 1200, and in the villages upwards of 200.\r\n\r\nThe last plague was supposed to have been brought in by a vessel from\r\nAlexandria, that entered the port on the 28th of March, 1813. It appeared\r\nthat two of the crew had been seized during the voyage with symptoms of\r\nplague, then prevailing in Alexandria, which place the vessel had left\r\nwith a foul bill of health. On the same day another vessel, the Nancy\r\narrived from the same port, having also on board two men labouring under\r\nthe disease, and she was followed by a Spanish polacca, the Bella Maria,\r\nfrom the same quarter. It was on the 16th of April that the disease first\r\nappeared in the island, in the case of a shoemaker in the Strada St.\r\nPaolo. The increase of the disorder was gradual, and from Valetta it\r\nspread to Citta Vecchia Bircharcara.\r\n\r\nMy late friend, staff-surgeon Tully, thus describes the situation of the\r\nIsland at this period: \"The warm season was now rapidly advancing, the\r\nthermometer having risen several degrees at the latter end of May, and\r\nunfortunately, through the superstitious prejudices of the natives,\r\nconsiderable dependence was placed upon the anxiously-looked-for\r\nalteration in the state of the atmosphere, and every day was consequently\r\nexpected to diminish the danger. This belief was too generally inculcated\r\nnot to be productive of much mischief, as most persons felt assured that,\r\nif they could avoid danger until the summer heat set in, the evil would\r\ncease, and that the greatly-dreaded disease would then die a natural\r\ndeath. The consequence of this unfortunate belief was fatal--the freedom\r\nof intercourse produced by this blind confidence, led to a very general\r\ncontamination, and men every where exposed to the baneful influence of the\r\nplague, became the active agents of the dissemination throughout the whole\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the plague was thus raging at Malta, it made its appearance amongst\r\nthe inhabitants of the Morea, having, it is supposed, been introduced from\r\nRomelia, by a man of the name of Kalangi, who was taken ill on his\r\narrival, and died in two days. The following day his wife and daughter\r\nwere attacked by the malady, which rapidly extended to Tornovo, and all\r\nthe neighbouring towns. During the years 1813 and 1814, the banks of the\r\nLepanto and the shores of Albania were nearly depopulated.\r\n\r\nIn 1815 the fatal scourge broke out in the island of Corfu, in the village\r\nof Marathia. None of the medical men who attended the sick during this\r\nperiod, attributed the invasion of the disease to contagion.\r\n\r\nThe doubt that had arisen in the minds of several experienced\r\npractitioners in regard to the non-contagious nature of the plague, is a\r\nmatter of vital interest, since it not only concerns the health of\r\nnations, but in a commercial point of view it becomes a question of\r\npolitical economy of the utmost importance, as the severity of the\r\nquarantine laws, which must materially effect the prosperity of trade,\r\nwould become useless if it could be proved that no contagion is to be\r\napprehended from a free intercourse. It is somewhat curious that Dr. Mead\r\nlong ago expressed his decided opinion that whenever the doctrine of\r\nnon-contagion should be revived in England, (and it will be so, he adds,\r\neven a hundred years hence,) it will always excite alarm amongst those\r\nnations who are more prudent than ourselves, and less eager to entertain\r\nevery kind of wild and visionary speculation.\r\n\r\nThe contagionists affirm that the destructive ravages of the plague of\r\nMarseilles in 1720, when 60,000 inhabitants were carried off, arose from\r\nneglect in enforcing a rigid separation of the diseased from the healthy\r\npart of the community. The mortality in the plague of Messina, in 1743,\r\nduring which 43,000 people fell victims to the disorder, is also referred\r\nto similar causes. They also maintain that the London plague of 1593,\r\nwhich destroyed 11,503 persons, was ascertained to have been introduced\r\nfrom Alkmaer; that the pestilence of London in 1603, which carried off\r\n36,269 inhabitants, was brought from Ostend, and further that in 1636, the\r\nscourge which destroyed 13,480 victims in our metropolis, had been\r\nimported from Leyden. In 1665, when its still more fatal ravages swept\r\naway 68,596 citizens, it had also been traced to our foreign intercourse.\r\nDr. Merlens who has accurately described the plague that raged at Moscow\r\nin 1771, asserts that it was introduced by a communication with the\r\nTurkish army. Notwithstanding which, by keeping the patients strictly\r\nguarded, the city was maintained free from infection, while the disease\r\nraged around in every quarter.\r\n\r\nMr. Jackson gives a similar account of the plague at Morocco; and he adds,\r\nthat daily observations convinced him that the epidemic was not caught by\r\napproach, unless that approach was accompanied by an inhaling of the\r\nbreath, or by tending upon the infected person. With such a discrepance of\r\nopinion, we cannot be surprised at this anxiety to impugn the doctrine of\r\nthose practitioners who maintain, that contagion is not to be dreaded, and\r\nthat severe sanitary precautions are therefore vexatious and oppressive.\r\nIf the progress of the disease, say the non-contagionists, depends upon\r\npersonal contact with infected persons or goods, its ravages would never\r\ncease in those countries where no precautionary measures are taken to\r\nprevent communication between the infected and the healthy; that in Turkey\r\nfor instance, where these precautions are not resorted to, there would be\r\nno cessation of the malady until it had swept away the whole of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nTo these arguments, plausible as they may appear in theory, it has been\r\nreplied, that the plague to a certain extent has never ceased to exist in\r\nthe Ottoman empire, but breaks out occasionally after temporary\r\nintermissions. As to the permanence of the diseases it is well known that\r\nlike all other epidemic or endemic diseases, the plague may also be\r\nsubject to atmospheric influence and be arrested in its progress without\r\nhuman aid. Sir James M'Grigor illustrates this fact in his \"Sketches of\r\nthe Expedition of the Indian Troops to Egypt.\" When the disease first\r\nbroke out in the army, the cases sent from the regiments were from the\r\ncommencement attended with typhoid symptoms; while those from the Bengal\r\nvolunteer battalion, and the other corps encamped near the marshes of El\r\nHamed, were of an intermittent and remittent type. The cases that occurred\r\nin the cold and rainy months of December and January, were of an\r\ninflammatory character, after which, as the weather became warmer, the\r\ndisease at Cairo, Ghiza, Boula, and the isthmus of Suez assumed the form\r\nof a mild continual fever. The plague of London in 1665, was in like\r\nmanner distinguished by a peculiar constitution of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nIt has also been doubted whether the plague be contagious in every\r\ninstance of its appearance. Various persons have inoculated themselves\r\nwith its virus with impunity, though several were ultimately victims of\r\nthe bold experiment. In Egypt Dr. White inoculated himself ten times, but\r\ndied of the disease after the eleventh trial.[16]\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere of contagion it appears is limited, and strict attention to\r\nkeep up a line of separation generally proves effectual in arresting or\r\nchecking its progress. Contact appears necessary to extend the malady, and\r\na direct absorption through the skin forms the ordinary means of\r\ntransmission. When the cutaneous pores are closed by oil, or any other\r\nsubstance of the kind, an exemption from the fatal scourge has been\r\nfrequently observed. Mr. Baldwin states, that among upwards of a million\r\nof inhabitants carried off by the plague in Upper and Lower Egypt during\r\nthe space of four years, not a single oil-man, or dealer in oil, had\r\nsuffered. Mr. Jackson made the same observation in the plague of Tunis.\r\nDr. Assalini, an intelligent medical officer of the French army in Egypt,\r\ndoes not attribute this exemption to the stoppage of the pores, but as the\r\nresult of profuse perspiration which the inunction of oil produces. The\r\n_zeit jagghy_ or olive oil, is considered a specific by most of the\r\nAsiatics; and my late friend Mr. Tully observed that all the attendants\r\nupon patients suffering from the plague, who carefully smeared their\r\npersons and their clothes with this substance, were exempt from the\r\ninfection. The same observation was corroborated by Sir Brooke Faulkener,\r\nduring the plague of Malta.\r\n\r\nVarious have been the remedial means proposed in this terrific malady, and\r\npreservatives against it have been recorded in the following distich:\r\n\r\n  Haec tria labificum tollunt adverbia pestem;\r\n  Mox, longe, tarde,--cede, recede, redi.\r\n\r\nThe celebrated plague-water was composed of master-wort, angelica, peony,\r\nand butter-bur, viper-grass, Virginia snake-root, rue, rosemary, balm,\r\ncarduus, water-germander, marygold, dragon-blood, goats'-rue, and mint,\r\ninfused in spirits of wine.\r\n\r\nIt appears manifest from all the evidence adduced by the contending\r\ntheorists, that we may come to the following corollaries:\r\n\r\n1. Plague may generally be considered as arising from contagion.\r\n\r\n2. The spread and decline of the disease is influenced by local\r\npeculiarities and revolutions in atmospheric constitution.\r\n\r\n3. It appears probable, that under peculiar local circumstances, it may\r\nhave arisen spontaneously, without having been introduced by contagion;\r\nbut this invasion must be considered of very rare occurrence.\r\n\r\n4. Although transmitted by contagion, a certain distance preserves the\r\nhealthy from the contamination of the diseased.\r\n\r\n5. The enforcement of a limit of separation must be considered\r\nindispensable in all our sanitary regulations, in the framing of which\r\ngreat attention must be paid to discriminate between contagion and\r\ninfection--two sources of distemper essentially different from each other.\r\n\r\nAlthough these precautions are pointed out by the result of long and\r\nunbiassed experience, they will in all probability be solely applicable to\r\nthe plague: for we have every reason to believe that these sanitary\r\nmeasures will not prove efficient against the invasion of cholera, the\r\nyellow fever, and other diseases, which are by no means proved to be\r\ninfectious or contagious. Without entering into the discussion, I feel no\r\nhesitation in giving it, as my decided opinion, that the cholera and\r\nyellow fever are not contagious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSTINENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nHippocrates asserted that most individuals who abstain from food for seven\r\ndays, die within that period; or, if they survive this time, and are even\r\nthen prevailed upon to eat or drink they still perish. Various instances\r\nof persons who have lived much longer without sustenance have been\r\nobserved. In the records of the Tower we find the history of Cicely de\r\nRidgeway, who was condemned to death for the murder of her husband in the\r\nreign of Edward III., and who remained for forty days without food or\r\ndrink. This being ascribed to a miracle, she was of course pardoned. From\r\nthe result of this starvation, the story may be considered fabulous for\r\ntwo reasons: first, from the improbability of the alleged abstinence; and,\r\nsecondly, from the selection of forty days, a period clearly fixed upon\r\nfor miracle-making, being the exact number of days our Saviour fasted.\r\n\r\nWe have a better authenticated case in the one mentioned by Dr. Eccles in\r\nthe Edinburgh Medical Essays for 1720. The starved person was a beautiful\r\nyoung lady, about sixteen years of age, who, in consequence of the sudden\r\ndeath of her father, was thrown into a state of tetanus (lock-jaw) so\r\nviolent as to render her incapable of swallowing for two long and distinct\r\nperiods,--the first of thirty-four, and the second of fifty-four\r\ndays,--during which she neither experienced a sense of hunger nor of\r\nthirst, and when she recovered, she was scarcely reduced in size. Sir\r\nWilliam Hamilton saw a girl, sixteen years of age, who was extricated from\r\nthe ruins of a house at Oppido, in which she had remained eleven days: an\r\ninfant in her arms, but a few months old, had died on the fourth day, as\r\nthe young are not so able to endure abstinence. Dr. Willan attended a\r\nyoung man who had abstained from any sustenance except a little water\r\nflavoured with orange-juice for sixty days: death ensued a fortnight\r\nafter. Fodere mentions some workmen who were extricated alive from a cold\r\ndamp cavern, in which they had been immured under a ruin for fourteen\r\ndays. Cetois, a physician of Poitiers, relates a still more singular case\r\nof total abstinence in a girl, who, from the age of eleven to that of\r\nfourteen, took no nourishment.\r\n\r\nAnn Moore, called the fasting woman of Tutbury, was to a certain extent an\r\nimpostor, for although there was no truth in her assertion that she lived\r\nan incredible time without food, yet it appeared evident that her chief,\r\nif not her only support, was tea. That fluid is sufficient to maintain\r\nlife appears evident from two papers inserted in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions; one of them giving an account of four men who were compelled\r\nto subsist upon water for twenty-four days, and the other of a young man\r\nwho tasted nothing but the same fluid for eighteen years. An imposition\r\nhaving been suspected, he was shut up in close confinement for twenty days\r\nas a trial, when he uniformly enjoyed good health.\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful instance of the same kind is that of Janet M'Leod,\r\npublished by Dr. M'Kenzie. She was at the time thirty-three years of age,\r\nunmarried, and from the age of fifteen had had various attacks of\r\nepilepsy, which had produced so rigid a lock-jaw that her mouth could\r\nrarely be forced open by any contrivance; she had lost very nearly the\r\npower of speech and deglutition, and with this all desire to eat or drink.\r\nHer lower limbs were retracted towards her body; she was entirely confined\r\nto her bed, slept much, and had periodical discharges of blood from the\r\nlungs, which were chiefly thrown out by the nostrils. During a few\r\nintervals of relaxation, she was prevailed upon with great difficulty to\r\nput a few crumbs of bread comminuted in the hand into her mouth, together\r\nwith a little water sucked from her own hand, and, in one or two\r\ninstances, a little gruel; but, even in these attempts, almost the whole\r\nwas rejected. On two occasions, also, after a total abstinence of many\r\nmonths, she made signs of wishing to drink some water, which was\r\nimmediately procured for her. On the first experiment the whole seemed to\r\nbe returned from her mouth, but she was greatly refreshed in having it\r\nrubbed upon her throat. On the second occasion she drank off a pint at\r\nonce, but could not be prevailed upon to drink any more, although her\r\nfather had now fixed a wedge between her teeth. With these exceptions,\r\nhowever, she seemed to have passed upwards of four years without either\r\nliquids or solids of any kind, or even an appearance of swallowing; she\r\nlay for the most part like a log of wood, with a pulse scarcely\r\nperceptible from feebleness, but distinct and regular. Her countenance was\r\nclear and pretty fresh; her features neither disfigured nor sunk; her\r\nbosom round and prominent, and her limbs not emaciated. Dr. M'Kenzie\r\nwatched her with occasional visits for eight or nine years, at the close\r\nof which period she seemed to be a little improved.\r\n\r\nA Dutch girl of the name of Eve Hergen is reported to have lived from the\r\nyear 1597 to 1611 with no other support than the scent of flowers. The\r\nmagistrates of Meurs suspecting imposition, had her closely watched for\r\nthirteen successive days, without being able to detect any fraud. Over her\r\npicture were affixed some Latin verses, of which the following translation\r\nwas given in a book called \"An Apologie or Declaration of the Power and\r\nProvidence of God, by George Hakewell, 1635:\"\r\n\r\n  This maid of Meurs thirty-six yeares spent,\r\n  Fourteen of which she tooke no nourishment;\r\n  Thus pale and wan, she sits sad and alone,\r\n  A garden's all she loves to looke upon.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny, the _Astoni_ had no other food than this Batavian\r\nmaiden, being unfortunately born without mouths. Sauvages mentions an\r\nacademician of Toulouse who never thirsted, and passed his summers,\r\nnotwithstanding the intense heat, without drinking. In most of the\r\nrecorded cases of total or nearly total abstinence, water has been found\r\nmore or less necessary, but not invariably.\r\n\r\nThat some animals can thrive upon water, and even upon air, is\r\ndemonstrated by naturalists. Snails and chameleons have been known to\r\nexist upon air for years. Garman has found that this nutriment is\r\nsufficient for the support of spiders; and Latreille has confirmed the\r\nexperiment by fixing a spider to a piece of cork, and precluding it from\r\nany communication. Every entomologist repeatedly sees insects living in\r\ntheir cases, although pinned down for an incredible length of time. Mr.\r\nBaker relates that he kept a beetle shut up for three years without any\r\nfood. Mr. Bruce kept two cerastes, or horned snakes, in a glass jar for\r\ntwo years, without any apparent food; he did not observe that they slept\r\nin the winter season, and they cast their skin as usual on the last day of\r\nApril.\r\n\r\nRudolphi kept a _Proteus Anguinus_ five years, and Zoys had one for ten\r\nyears living on spring water renewed from time to time. Redi found that\r\nbirds could sustain the want of food from five to twenty-eight days. A\r\nseal lived out of the water and without nourishment for four weeks. Four\r\nindividuals of a large species of larval shell, (_Bulimus_,) from\r\nValparaiso, were brought to England by Lieut. Graves. They had been packed\r\nup in a box, and enclosed in cotton; two for a space of thirteen, one for\r\nseventeen, and a fourth for upwards of twenty months; but on being exposed\r\nto the warmth of a fire in London, and provided with tepid water and\r\nleaves, they revived and lived for several months in Mr. Loddige's palm\r\nhouse, till accidentally drowned. Dogs can live without food from\r\ntwenty-five to thirty-six days, but man does not easily support starvation\r\nmore than a week, except in disease or insanity.\r\n\r\nThe general effects of long fasting, however, are highly injurious when\r\nnot destructive. They are chiefly feelings of great debility, fever,\r\ndelirium, violent passion alternating with deep despondency. In general\r\nthe temperature of the body falls several degrees, although Currie\r\nobserved the contrary in a patient who died of inanition in consequence of\r\na stricture of the oesophagus; the respiration becomes fetid, the\r\nsecretion of the kidneys acrid and burning, and according to Magendie and\r\nCollard bloody, and the stomach is found contracted after death.\r\nExperiments on the duration of life in man and animals deprived of food,\r\nshow that the warm-blooded animals are best able to support the want of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nBut a phenomenon still more wonderful is the faculty that animals have\r\nbeen known to possess of living when deprived of atmospheric support. A\r\nhog, weighing about one hundred and sixty pounds, was buried in his sty\r\nunder thirty feet of the chalk of Dover cliff for one hundred and sixty\r\ndays. When dug out, it weighed but forty pounds, and was extremely\r\nemaciated, but clean, and white. The animal had nibbled the wood of the\r\nsty, and eaten some loose chalk. Lizards, especially the Newt, have been\r\nfound embedded in chalk-rock, apparently dead, but have reassumed living\r\naction on exposure to the atmosphere. On their detection in this state,\r\nthe mouth is usually closed with a glutinous substance so tenaciously,\r\nthat they are often suffocated in their efforts to extricate themselves\r\nfrom confinement. Toads have been repeatedly discovered in a similar\r\nsituation, embedded in blocks of stone, or in the very heart of trees. Dr.\r\nEdwards, a learned physiologist in Paris, has ascertained that blocks of\r\nmortar and heaps of sand possess sufficient porosity to admit enough air\r\nto support the life of reptiles; but they all perish if immersed in water\r\nor mercury, when surrounded by an exhausting receiver. The duration of\r\nexistence of the amphibials of the Batrachian family, when plunged in\r\nwater, depends in a great measure on its temperature. They die speedily if\r\nthe water be lower than 32 deg. Fahrenheit, or higher than 108 deg.; and\r\nthe longest duration of life is under 32 deg.\r\n\r\nHow can we account for these anomalies? Various solid substances are known\r\nto proceed from invisible elementary principles. Do water and air contain\r\nthem? Metallic stones of large volume fall from the air: how are they\r\nproduced? whence come they? How vain and feeble are our pursuits, when the\r\nvanity of science seeks to penetrate into the arcana of nature; searching\r\nand endeavouring to account for the causes of causation! What absurd and\r\nimpertinent hypotheses have not been broached on scholastic benches! They\r\nremind us of an anecdote related of the old Parisian Academy, when one of\r\nits sapient members read a voluminous memoir to prove that tides were\r\nprovided by the Creator for the purpose of bringing vessels in and out of\r\nharbour; when one of the Encyclopedian wits gravely observed, that he had\r\nno doubt of the fact, since he had discovered, after unceasing and\r\nlaborious research, that noses were made for the purpose of wearing\r\nspectacles!\r\n\r\nAlthough total abstinence from food for any length of time, excepting with\r\nhibernating animals, is a wondrous phenomenon, yet it is singular how\r\nlittle aliment is necessary for the purpose of sustaining life, and even\r\nhealth. Many instances of a frugality bordering upon starvation are known.\r\nThe most economical housekeeper on record was Roger Crabb, the\r\nBuckinghamshire hermit, who allowed himself three farthings a week.\r\n\r\nDr. Gower of Chelmsford had a patient who lived for ten years on a pint of\r\ntea daily, now and then chewing half a dozen raisins and almonds, but\r\nwithout swallowing them; once a month, by way of a treat, she ate a morsel\r\nof bread the size of a nutmeg.\r\n\r\nThe late Duke of Portland, after a long illness, during which he was\r\nattended by Dr. Warren, lived on bread and water for six weeks, at the\r\nexpiration of which he was allowed _one boiled smelt_. Numerous persons\r\nhave been known to live to old age, in perfect health, who never used\r\nanimal food or wine; such was Dr. Hecquet, the Sangrado of Lesage, who\r\npublished a curious treatise on fasting in Lent: Paris, 1709.\r\n\r\nThe following lines were written on a man named Offley:\r\n\r\n  Offley three dishes had of daily roast;\r\n  An egg, an apple, and the third a toast.\r\n\r\nMost unquestionably, if this Offley was not a man of hard labour, or who\r\ntook much exercise, this diet, scanty as it may appear, would have been\r\nquite sufficient to support life, for his fare was sumptuous, compared to\r\nthe diet prescribed by St. Theresa to her Carmelite nuns, and which\r\nconsisted of one egg, herb-soup, with wormwood ashes and aloes. However,\r\nin regard to the wondrous fasting of various hermits and holy men, we must\r\ntake their histories _cum grano salis_. They clearly belonged to two\r\nclasses,--enthusiasts or impostors: enthusiasm, which is little short of\r\nlunacy, enables the monomaniac to endure starvation with ease; and as to\r\nimpostors, it is probable that, like Friar Tuck they had a _bonne bouche_\r\nin a corner of their cells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISON OF THE UPAS, OR IPO.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the names given by the natives of the Molucca Islands and in the\r\nIndian Archipelago to a deadly poison which is used to impregnate the\r\nheads of their arrows. The tree from which it is extracted is named _Bohou\r\nUpas_, _Boa Upas_, and _Pohou Antiar_. Various accounts of its deleterious\r\nnature have been given by ancient travellers. Cleyer and Spielman\r\ndescribed it upwards of a century back, and state that no antidote to its\r\ndreadful action is known, though vomiting, produced by the most disgusting\r\nmeans, was considered the only method of arresting its dire effects.\r\nSpielman asserts that the land for several miles round these trees is\r\ndesolate and barren, for no plant can grow under their influence. The\r\npoison, he states, flows in a milky form from the tree, and no one can\r\napproach it at this period, as one drop of the fatal juice falling upon\r\nthe face or hands produces instant stiffness of every limb, followed by\r\nrapid death; it is therefore obtained at the end of long bamboo canes,\r\narmed with a pointed tube to receive it when plunged into the bark.\r\nRumphius confirms in a great measure the above statements, and describes\r\nthe tree, which he divides into male and female: he adds, that they only\r\ngrow in the island of Celebes, and that all around the dreaded spot is\r\ndesert and consumed. A more recent Dutch traveller, Foersech or Fooerch,\r\ndid not let so fertile a subject escape, and has cultivated most\r\nindustriously this dreary desert in the following account.\r\n\r\nSterility prevails for upwards of ten miles round this dreadful tree on\r\nthe part of the island of Java where it grows. When criminals are\r\nsentenced to death, they are offered a free pardon if they consent to seek\r\na small boxful of this valuable yet terrific poison. They are first sent\r\nto the dwelling of a priest who resides at a safe distance from the spot;\r\nthere they arrive, accompanied by their disconsolate and wailing families.\r\nThey remain with this holy man for a few days, during which he affords\r\nthem both spiritual comfort and good advice; the latter urging the\r\nprecaution not to set out until the wind blows in such a direction as to\r\nwaft from them the floating emanations. On their departure on this dreaded\r\nexpedition he gives them a small box of silver or tortoise-shell, covers\r\ntheir head and face with a leathern hood with glass eyes, and protects\r\ntheir hands with a thick pair of gloves of the same material. He then\r\naccompanies them about two miles on their sad journey, and then he\r\ndescribes the hellish spot where this treasure is to be found as minutely\r\nas any one can describe what he has not seen; then, giving the poor\r\npilgrim his blessing, he departs on his return. This worthy man informed\r\nour traveller that, during thirty years which he had held that enviable\r\nsituation, he had sent off no less than seven hundred criminals, of whom\r\nonly twenty-two returned: and he confirmed the statement by exhibiting a\r\nlist bearing their names and the offences for which they had been tried.\r\nMynheer Foersech further assures his gentle readers that he witnessed\r\nseveral of these expeditions, and entreated the culprits to bring him some\r\nbranches of the tree; but two withered leaves were the only specimens he\r\ncould obtain from the solitary wretch who had the good fortune to escape,\r\nand who described the tree as growing on the borders of a rivulet, being\r\nof moderate height, and surrounded by a cluster of young ones. The ground\r\naround them was of a brown sandy nature, and strewed with the remains of\r\nhuman victims. He also clearly ascertained that no living creature can\r\nexist within fifteen miles of the spot. The streams that flow near it\r\nyield no fish, and the birds that fly over it fall to the ground; several\r\nof the latter were occasionally brought to the priest,--whether he ate\r\nthem, or not, the Dutchman does not inform us. Amongst various offenders\r\ndoomed to death by this poison he relates the case of thirteen ladies,\r\nwho, for the crime of infidelity, were inoculated in the bosom with the\r\npoint of a kritz or Malayan dagger dipped in the upas; and in sixteen\r\nminutes they had ceased to live. By recent experiments upon animals this\r\npart of his narration may be credited; but, in regard to the other\r\naccount, we must apply to it the French saying, \"_Il vaut mieux y croire\r\nque d'y aller voir_.\" Indeed the whole of Foersech's account is justly\r\nconsidered a fiction.\r\n\r\nHowever, some French travellers thought otherwise; and Mr. Deschamps,\r\nphysician and naturalist attached to the expedition of Mr.\r\nD'Entrecasteaux, when in Java, ascertained that this wonderful tree was\r\nnot uncommon in the forests of the country, nor was the approach to it in\r\nthe slightest degree apprehended. The juice procured by incisions in the\r\nbark was called by the natives _upas_ or _oupas_, and was of so active a\r\nnature that it caused immediate death when thrown into the circulation.\r\nThe Malays mixed it with various other ingredients more especially galanga\r\nand garlic, when they employed it. The Javanese only impregnated their\r\narrows with it for the chase: a proof that they did not consider it as\r\naffecting the system of the slain animal. Most probably Foersech's priest\r\nwas aware of this circumstance when he accepted from the privileged\r\nmalefactors the game killed by the tree they had sought.\r\n\r\nThis tree, according to Deschamps, is named in the country, _pohou\r\nantiar_; it frequently rises to the height of thirty or forty feet. When\r\none of its branches is broken, or its bark incised, a milky juice exudes,\r\nwhich becomes inspissated when in contact with the atmosphere. In\r\nappearance this tree bears some resemblance to our elm. Mr. Deschamps\r\nconfirms the relation of Rumphius, who stated that the Dutch, in their\r\nwars with the natives, were obliged to wear thick buff cuirasses to\r\nprotect them against their poisoned missiles, the wounds of which were\r\ninevitably fatal.\r\n\r\nFurther information relative to the upas has been afforded by the\r\ningenious Mr. Leschenault, who, during his residence in Java, procured two\r\nspecimens of the poisonous substance obtained in Java, and of that brought\r\nfrom the islands of Borneo and Macassar. In Borneo, the mountaineers of\r\nthe interior, who are called _Orang-Daias_, collect it, and keep its\r\npreparation a profound secret. They carry it carefully wrapped up in\r\npalm-leaves. Their hunting arrows have heads spear-pointed, and\r\nimpregnated with this substance; those that are prepared for war bear a\r\nshark's tooth fixed in a brass socket, and merely attached to the shaft by\r\nthe gum resin of the ipo; the barbed point remaining rankling in the wound\r\nit has inflicted, the gum dissolves, and speedily brings on death. Mr.\r\nLeschenault tried these arrows on dogs and other animals, and they expired\r\nshortly after in horrible convulsions.\r\n\r\nBut the latest account of this celebrated tree is given by Dr. Horsfield\r\nwho was in Java during its occupation by our troops. He informs us that\r\nalthough the Dutch surgeon Foersech's account must have been a\r\nfabrication, yet there did exist a tree called the _Anchar_ from the sap\r\nof which the natives prepared a fatal poison. The tree belongs to the 21st\r\nclass of Linnaeus, the _Monaecia_. The male and female flowers are produced\r\non the same branch at no great distance from each other, the females being\r\nin general above the males. The seed-vessel is an oblong drupe, covered\r\nwith the calyx; the seed an ovate nut with cells. The top of the stem\r\nsends off a few stout branches, which spreading nearly horizontally with\r\nseveral irregular curves, divide into smaller branches, and form a\r\nhemispherical, not very regular crown. The stem is cylindrical,\r\nperpendicular, and rises completely naked to the height of sixty or\r\nseventy, and even eighty feet. Near the surface of the ground it spreads\r\nobliquely like many of our large forest trees. The bark is whitish,\r\nslightly bursting into longitudinal furrows. Near the ground this bark is,\r\nin old trees, more than half an inch thick, and when wounded yields\r\ncopiously the milky juice from which the poison is prepared. This juice is\r\nyellowish, frothy, and becomes brown when exposed to the air.\r\n\r\nIn making these researches Dr. Horsfield had some difficulty with the\r\nnative labourers, who feared a contagious eruption, but nothing more. The\r\nDoctor further informs us that it is fatal to animals,--destroying dogs in\r\nan hour, mice in ten minutes, monkeys in seven, and cats in fifteen, while\r\na buffalo subjected to the experiment was two hours and ten minutes dying.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Macassar also call this venomous production _ipo_. They\r\nhave two varieties of the tree, as in Java; the one called _upas antiar_,\r\nand the other, much more violent and prompt in its action, _upas tieute_\r\nIn the preparation of the poison for use much mystery is observed by the\r\nnatives, and various ingredients are mixed up with it; but as they are\r\nknown to be harmless, such as onion and garlic juice, pepper, ginger,\r\ngalanga, they are most probably employed to deceive the curious who might\r\nwish to ascertain the nature of this deadly composition.\r\n\r\nMr. Leschenault having brought home a small quantity of this poison, it\r\nwas tried by Messrs. Delile and Magendie in several experiments, when it\r\nwas found to act more or less violently, according to the age and size of\r\nthe individual, or the quantity of the upas. One grain and a half\r\ninoculated in a young dog killed it in four minutes, only producing one\r\nconvulsive fit. In a dog weighing fourteen pounds, half a grain of upas\r\noccasioned death at the expiration of one hour and fifty-seven minutes,\r\nduring which the animal experienced several violent convulsions. A few\r\ndrops of diluted upas, injected in the chest of a dog, weighing twenty\r\npounds, occasioned a lock-jaw, which destroyed him in a minute and a half.\r\nEight drops injected in the jugular vein of a horse produced immediate\r\ntetanus and speedy death. For further information regarding these cruel\r\nexperiments we must refer to the experimenter's publication. It appears,\r\nhowever, that the power of this venomous substance is so intense that time\r\ndoes not weaken it; for the upas employed in these experiments had been\r\ncollected and kept for upwards of seven years, when its effects were as\r\nprompt as when tried in a recent state. The natives of Java consider\r\nsea-salt as the best antidote, but Mr. Delile found it quite inert:\r\nvarious experiments induced him to think that in these cases death is\r\nproduced by asphyxia; and he considers the means employed to restore\r\nsuspended animation in persons supposed to have been drowned, as the most\r\nlikely to save the life of individuals who might be wounded with this\r\nsubstance. The rapidity with which poisonous substances are absorbed in\r\nthe system is truly terrific, more especially in such as are of a narcotic\r\nnature. The latter act by abolishing all nervous energies, but when\r\napplied locally their effects are also local, as is shown by the following\r\nexperiments of Mueller:\r\n\r\n\"I held the nerve of a frog's leg which was separated from the body, in a\r\nwatery solution of opium for a short time, and that portion of the nerve\r\nlost its irritability, i.e. its property of exciting twitchings of the leg\r\nwhen it was irritated; but below the part that the poison had touched the\r\nnerve still retained this function.\"\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that before narcotic poisons can exert a general\r\ninfluence they must be carried into the circulation. Duprey and Brachet,\r\ntwo French physiologists, have sought to prove that animals cannot be\r\ndestroyed by narcotic poisons, introduced in the stomach, if the _nervus\r\nvagus_ has been divided on both sides; at least, that they do not die so\r\nsoon. However, Wernscheidt, in thirty experiments on mammalia, could not\r\nperceive this difference, provided the animals were of the same size and\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nPrussic acid exerts its influence so rapidly that it cannot be supposed to\r\nhave been thrown into the circulation. The spirituous solution of the\r\nextract of nux vomica introduced in the mouth of a rabbit, produces\r\nimmediate death, whereas when applied to any nerve distant from the brain\r\nit produces no general symptoms.\r\n\r\nThis rapid effect of prussic acid is supposed to arise from its great\r\nvolatility and powers of expansion, by which it is diffused more quickly\r\nthrough the circulation than the blood. According to Schrader one drop of\r\nthis substance introduced in the bill of a bird killed it in four or five\r\nminutes. Hydrocyanic acid gas mixed with atmospheric air has when inhaled\r\ndestroyed dogs, cats, rabbits, and various birds, in from two to ten\r\nseconds. Magendie found that the introduction of one drop of the acid in\r\nthe jugular vein caused instantaneous death; a glass tube dipped in this\r\nperilous substance applied to the tongue of a dog, produced a similar\r\neffect, which was also the result when applied to the eye.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that tobacco and its preparations are deadly\r\npoisons, one drop of oil of tobacco introduced in the mouth of a dog\r\nproduced violent convulsions with hurried breathing; a quarter of an hour\r\nafter, the unfortunate animal seemed to be recovered, when the\r\nintroduction of another drop killed it in two minutes. M'Cartney and\r\nOrfila obtained similar results, though no such effects were produced when\r\nit was applied to a nerve or the surface of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe French poet Santeuil died from having drank wine in a glass containing\r\nsome snuff. In all cases of death produced by this substance the lungs are\r\nfound dense and livid.\r\n\r\nIt is not only in the upas that the Indians seek the means of poisoning\r\ntheir missiles. In America they employ the _Ticronas_ a juice extracted\r\nfrom various plants, and the preparation of which, transmitted from one\r\ngeneration to another is considered a valuable secret. La Condamine\r\nasserts that its mere odour is sufficient to destroy the criminals doomed\r\nto smell it, but Fontana has found by many experiments that this assertion\r\nwas made upon report, which travellers too frequently rely upon to save\r\nthemselves the trouble of investigation. Arrows saturated with this\r\npoison, become more active after having been dipped in hot water.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of Guiana dip their arrows in the juice of the _Woorara_, and\r\nthe _Curara_, which also occasions rapid death and decomposition of the\r\nlungs. Humboldt informs us that the _Curara_ is obtained from the bark of\r\na tree called _Vejuco_ de _Mavacure_; it is inspissated over a slow fire\r\nand then mixed with a gum drawn from the _Kiracagnero_. The Abbe Salvador\r\nGilii tells us in his history of America, that he has seen the strongest\r\nanimals succumb instantly when thus wounded, but the poison does not\r\nproduce any effect on their meat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOMOPHAGOUS AND POLYPHAGOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are appellations given to certain individuals of a depraved\r\nappetite, that enables them to devour raw meat, and various other\r\nsubstances which most unquestionably would destroy any person not gifted\r\nor cursed with such an omnivorous digestion.\r\n\r\nVarious are the ancient stories related of such voracious wretches. Ovid\r\ndescribes one Erisichthon, who, as a punishment for cutting down the\r\ngroves of Ceres, (very possibly to obtain fuel to cook his food,) was\r\nsentenced to perpetual hunger, and terminated his gluttonous career by\r\neating up his own limbs. Theagenes thought nothing of an ox for his\r\ndinner; and the famed Crotonian athlete, Milo, knocked down bullocks with\r\nhis fist for his daily meals, which usually consisted of twenty _minae_ of\r\nmeat and the same ration of bread. Vopiscus relates that a man was brought\r\nbefore the Emperor Maximilian, who devoured a whole calf, and was\r\nproceeding to eat up a sheep, had he not been prevented. To this day, in\r\nIndia, some voracious mountebanks devour a live sheep as an exhibition.\r\nDr. Boehmen of Wittenberg witnessed the performance of one of these\r\npolyphagous individuals, who commenced his repast by eating a raw sheep, a\r\nsucking-pig, and, by way of dessert, swallowed sixty pounds of prunes,\r\nstones and all. On another festive occasion, he ate two bushels of\r\ncherries, with several earthen vases, and chips of a furnace. This meal\r\nwas followed up by sundry pieces of glass and pebbles, a shepherd's\r\nbagpipe, rats, various birds with their feathers, and an incredible number\r\nof caterpillars. To conclude his dinner, he swallowed a pewter inkstand,\r\nwith its pens, a pen-knife, and a sandbox. During this deglutition he\r\nseemed to relish his food, but was generally under the influence of\r\npotations of brandy. His form was athletic, and he could carry four heavy\r\nmen on his shoulders for a league. He lived to the age of seventy-nine,\r\nbut died in a most emaciated state, and, as might be imagined, toothless.\r\n\r\nHelwig knew an old man who was in the habit of eating eighty pounds of\r\ndifferent articles of food daily. Real Colomb mentions an omnivorous\r\nglutton, who, in the absence of any salutary aliment, satisfied his\r\ncravings with any other substance, and was once known, when hungry, to eat\r\nthe contents of a sack of charcoal, and then to swallow the bag to\r\nfacilitate its digestion. One of the attendants on the menagerie of the\r\nBotanical Gardens in Paris, who bore the euphonious name of _Bijou_, used\r\nto devour all the offals of the theatre of Comparative Anatomy, and ate a\r\ndead lion in one day. He was active, and lived to the age of sixty. A\r\ncannibal once desolated the Vivarais, by dragging human victims to his\r\nden, where he devoured them. On the opening of the corpse of a convict in\r\nthe galleys of Brest, there were found in his stomach about six hundred\r\npieces of wood, pewter, and iron.\r\n\r\nAll these accounts might appear most exaggerated, perhaps fabulous, had\r\nnot many physicians in Paris known the celebrated Tarrare. The history of\r\nthis monster is as curious as his habits were disgusting. He commenced his\r\ncareer in life in the capacity of clown to an itinerant quack, and used to\r\nattract the notice of the populace by his singular powers of deglutition,\r\nswallowing with the utmost ease corks, pebbles, and basketsful of apples.\r\nHowever, these experiments were frequently followed by severe pain and\r\naccidents, which once obliged him to seek assistance in the Hotel Dieu of\r\nParis. His sufferings did not deter him from similar experiments; and he\r\nonce tried to exhibit his wonderful faculties by swallowing the watch,\r\nchain and seals, of Mr. Giraud, then house-surgeon of the establishment.\r\nIn this repast he was foiled, having been told that he would be ripped up\r\nto recover the property. In the revolutionary war, Tarrare joined the\r\narmy, but was soon exhausted on the spare diet to which the troops were\r\nobliged to submit. In the hospital of Sultzen, although put upon four full\r\nrations, he was obliged to wander about the establishment to feed upon any\r\nsubstance he could find however revolting, to subdue his voracious hunger.\r\nThese singular powers induced several physicians to ascertain how far\r\nthese omnivorous inclinations could carry him in his unnatural cravings.\r\nIn presence of Dr. Lorentz he devoured a live cat, commencing by tearing\r\nopen its stomach, and sucking the animal's blood with delight. What was\r\nmore singular, after this horrible feast, like other carnivorous brutes,\r\nhe rejected the fur and skin. Snakes were to him a delicious meal, and he\r\nswallowed them alive and whole, after grinding their heads between his\r\nteeth. One of the surgeons, Mr. Courville, gave him a wooden lancet-case\r\nto swallow in which a written paper had been folded. This case was\r\nrejected undigested, and the paper being found intact, it became a\r\nquestion whether he might not be employed to convey secret correspondence;\r\nbut having been taken up at the Prussian outposts as a spy, being\r\ndisguised as a peasant without a knowledge of the language, he received a\r\nsevere bastinado, which effectually cured him of an appetite for secret\r\nservice, and on his return he had recourse to the safer means of obtaining\r\nfood in kitchens, slaughter-houses, and dunghills. At last, a child of\r\nfourteen months old having disappeared under suspicious circumstances, he\r\nwas driven out of the hospital, and lost sight of for four years, when he\r\napplied for admission into the hospital of Versailles, in a state of\r\ncomplete exhaustion, labouring under a violent diarrhoea, which\r\nterminated his hateful existence in his twenty-sixth year. He was of the\r\nmiddle size, pale, thin, and weak; his countenance was by no means\r\nferocious, but, on the contrary, displayed much timidity; his fair hair\r\nwas remarkably fine and soft; his mouth was very large, and one could\r\nscarcely say that he had any lips; all his teeth were sound, but their\r\nenamel was speckled; his skin was always hot, in a state of perspiration,\r\nand exhaling a constant offensive vapour. When fasting, the integuments of\r\nhis abdomen were so flaccid that he could nearly wrap them round him.\r\nAfter his meals the exhalation from his surface was increased, his eyes\r\nand cheeks became turgid with blood, and, dropping into a state of\r\ndrowsiness, he used to seek some obscure corner where he might quietly lie\r\ndown and digest. After his death, all the abdominal viscera were found in\r\na state of ulceration.\r\n\r\nInstances are recorded where a similar facility to swallow fluids had been\r\nobserved. At Strasburg the stomach of a hussar was exhibited who could\r\ndrink sixty quarts of wine in an hour. Pliny mentions a Milanese, named\r\n_Novellus Torquatus_, who, in presence of Tiberius, drank three _congii_\r\nof wine. Seneca and Tacitus knew a man of the name of Piso who could drink\r\nincessantly for two days and two nights; and Rhodiginus mentions a\r\ncapacious monster called _the Funnel_, down whose throat an amphora of\r\nliquor could be poured without interruption.\r\n\r\nTo what are we to attribute these uncommon, nay, these unnatural\r\nfaculties? Neither physiological experiments during life, nor anatomical\r\ninvestigation after death, have hitherto enabled us to form an opinion.\r\nGreat as the progress of science has been, we are still doubtful as to the\r\nnature of the digestive process. All the hypotheses on the subject are\r\nliable to insuperable objections. Hippocrates and Empedocles attributed\r\ndigestion to the _putrefaction_ of food. Experiments have clearly\r\ndemonstrated the fallacy of this doctrine: rejected food is never in a\r\nstate of putridity; on the contrary, meat in a perfect state of\r\nputrescence has been restored to sweetness and freshness on being received\r\ninto the stomach. Dead snakes have been found with animal substances,\r\npart of which had been swallowed and the remainder hanging out of their\r\nmouths; when the swallowed portion was fresh, and the portion exposed to\r\nthe atmosphere in a state of corruption. Galen, and after his school, Grew\r\nand Santarelli, ascribed digestion to a _concoction_, during which, food\r\nwas maturated by the stomach's heat, like fruit by the solar rays. Pringle\r\nand Macbride advocated the doctrine of _fermentation_; while Borelli,\r\nKeil, and Pitcairn resolved the question by the mechanism of\r\n_trituration_, making a mill of the stomach, which ground down food,\r\naccording to Pitcairn's calculations, with a pressure equal to a weight of\r\none hundred and seventeen thousand and eighty pounds. Boerhaave\r\nendeavoured to reconcile the opinions of the _concocters_ and _grinders_,\r\nby combining the supposed theory of _concoction_ and _trituration_.\r\nLastly, Cheselden fancied that digestion was operated by a peculiar\r\nsecretion in the stomach, called _gastric juice_; and Haller, Reaumur,\r\nSpallanzani, Blumenbach and most other modern physiologists, concur with\r\nhim in the same opinion, although admitting that this function is most\r\nprobably assisted by various accessory circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis juice was found, upon experiment, to be endowed, not only with the\r\nantiseptic power of preserving the contents of the stomach from\r\nputrefaction, but with the property of being a most powerful solvent.\r\nPieces of the toughest meats and bone have been enclosed in perforated\r\nmetallic tubes, and thrust down the stomach of carnivorous birds, and in\r\nthe space of about twenty-four hours the meats were found to be\r\ndiminished, or, in other words, digested to three-fourths of their bulk,\r\nwhile the bones had totally disappeared. Dr. Stevens had recourse to a\r\nsimilar experiment on the human stomach, by means of a perforated ivory\r\nball, and with the same result. The gastric juice of the dog dissolves\r\nivory; and that of a hen has dissolved an onyx, and diminished a golden\r\ncoin. Not long since, upon examining the stomach and intestines of a man\r\nwho died in a public-house, he was found to have been a _polyphagous_\r\nanimal, since several clasp-knives that he had swallowed were discovered\r\nwith their blades blunted and their handles consumed. Since these\r\nexperiments, however, Dr. Montegre of Paris, who was gifted with the\r\nfaculty of discharging the contents of his stomach at will, has fully\r\nproved that this gastric juice, when not in an acid state, is subject to\r\nputrefaction when submitted to external animal heat; that this corruption\r\ndid not occur when an acid prevailed, and saliva intermixed with vinegar\r\nwas equally free from a similar decomposition. He moreover asserts, that\r\nhe had recourse to numerous experiments to digest food artificially in\r\nthis supposed solvent, but without obtaining results similar to those\r\nadvanced by Spallanzani; and, finally, he found little or no difference\r\nbetween the gastric juice and saliva. This acid, which generally exists in\r\nthe gastric juice, has been ascertained by Dr. Prout to be the muriatic,\r\nboth free and in combination with alkalis: while Tiedemann and Gmelin\r\nmaintain that, in its natural state, no acid is to be met with; but that,\r\nwhen food is commingled, an acid which they consider the acetic acid is\r\nproduced in considerable quantity.[17]\r\n\r\nThe ostrich, that may be considered a connecting link between birds and\r\nquadrupeds, is gifted with powerful digestive organs, and is known to\r\nswallow stone, glass, and iron; but this faculty appears to be a gift of\r\nall-bounteous Providence, to enable the creature to digest the various\r\nsubstances it meets with when traversing burning deserts for hundreds of\r\nmiles, when these hard bodies actually perform the function of teeth in\r\nthe animal's stomach, by aiding the comminution of its indigestible food.\r\nThe structure of the ostrich has a near resemblance to that of the camel,\r\ndestined to perform the same dreary journeys. The wings are not designed\r\nfor flight, and in speed he equals the horse. Adanson affirms that he had\r\nseen two ostriches at the factory of Podore, that were broken in to carry\r\nsingle or double riders, and the strongest and youngest would run more\r\nswiftly with two negroes on his back than the fleetest racer.\r\n\r\nSpallanzani endeavoured to prove that the pebbles and gravel swallowed by\r\nvarious birds were of no use in the process of digestion; but Hunter, who\r\nhad found two hundred pebbles in the gizzard of a turkey, and one thousand\r\nin that of a goose, demonstrated their utility in the trituration of their\r\nfood, since these birds were found to be unable to digest, and\r\nconsequently to thrive upon their nourishment when deprived of this\r\nmechanical aid. It is curious that the owl, which easily digests meat and\r\nbones, cannot be made to digest bread or grain, and yet dies if confined\r\nto animal food. The eagle, and other birds of prey, can dissolve both. A\r\nsingular process of digestion is observed in the stormy petrel, which\r\nlives entirely on oil and fat substances whenever it can obtain them; but\r\nwhen fed with other articles of food, Nature, true to her laws, converts\r\nthem into oil; the bird still discharges pure oil at objects that offend\r\nhim, and feeds his young with the same substance. The petrel must, no\r\ndoubt, be a bilious subject, for he delights in misery, and his presence\r\nis a sure presage of foul weather to the experienced seamen; and when\r\n\r\n              The wrathful skies\r\n  Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,\r\n  And make them keep their caves,\r\n\r\nhe is seen riding triumphantly on the whirlwind, and skimming the deepest\r\nchasms of the angry waves. This bird is said to be named 'petrel' from\r\nPeter, since, like that saint, he is supposed to have the power of walking\r\non the waters.\r\n\r\nThe singular appetites which have been noticed seem to have been\r\nindividual peculiarities, uninfluenced by a morbid condition; but there\r\nare cases in which a depraved appetite is symptomatic of disease, where we\r\nsee persons otherwise possessed of sound judgment longing, not only for\r\nthe most improper and indigestible food, but for substances of the most\r\nextraordinary and even disgusting nature. Thus we have seen patients, more\r\nespecially young females and pregnant women, devouring dirt, cinders,\r\nspiders, leeches, hair, tallow, and paper. An ingenious writer affirms\r\nthat \"more literature in the form of paper and printed books has been thus\r\ndevoured, than by the first scholars in Christendom.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin tells us that he saw a young lady about ten years of age that\r\nused to fill her stomach with earth out of a flowerpot, and then vomited\r\nit up, with small stones, bits of wood, and wings of various insects. John\r\nHunter has described an endemic disease among the Africans in Jamaica, in\r\nwhich they devoured dirt. Mason Good, when speaking of this affection,\r\nsays, \"that the longing for such materials is, in this disease, a mere\r\nsymptom, and rarely shows itself till the frame is completely exhausted by\r\natrophy, dropsy, and hectic fever, brought on by a longing of a much more\r\nserious kind,--a longing to return home, a pining for the relations, the\r\nscenes, the kindnesses the domestic joys, of which the miserable sufferers\r\nhave been robbed by barbarians less humanized than themselves, and which\r\nthey have been forced or trepanned to resign for the less desirable\r\nbanquet of whips, and threats, and harness, and hunger.\"\r\n\r\nRoderic a Castro relates the case of a lady who could eat twenty pounds of\r\npepper, and another who lived upon ice. Tulpius mentions a woman who,\r\nduring her pregnancy, longed for salt herrings, and ate fourteen hundred\r\nat the rate of five herrings per diem. Longius affirms that a lady in\r\nCologne, who was in that state that ladies wish to be who love their\r\nlords, took such a fancy to taste the flesh of her husband that she\r\nactually assassinated him, and, after indulging in as much fresh meat as\r\nthe weather permitted, salted the remainder for further use. This cannibal\r\ninclination seems not to be uncommon. The said Roderic a Castro knew a\r\nwoman in the same thriving condition, who felt an inexpressible desire for\r\na bit of the shoulder of a neighbouring baker, and her husband was\r\npersecuted by her constant prayers and lamentations to prevail on the\r\nworthy man to allow her one bite for charity's sake: but the first bite\r\nwas so heartily inflicted, that the crusty baker would not submit to a\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nIn the Philosophical Transactions there is a case related of a woman whose\r\nfancies were not quite so solid, and who used to gratify her aerial\r\nappetites by putting the nozle of a bellows down her throat, and blowing\r\naway until she was tired. These longings of parturient women are most\r\ncommon; but it is rather curious, that, among our negroes in the West\r\nIndies, the husbands pretend to long for their wives, and endeavour to\r\ngratify them by proxy. Possibly such might have been the fancy of Cambes,\r\nthe Lydian prince, who, according to Aelian, took it into his head one\r\nnight to eat up his beloved wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSES OF INSANITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMadness is attributed to moral and physical causes. Physicians do not\r\nagree as to the prevalence of either of these sources of human misery.\r\nSome of them, most unjustly accused of materialism, seem to lean to the\r\nopinion that, generally speaking, physical causes can be traced in _post\r\nmortem_ examination; while others, equally skilled in accurate anatomical\r\ninvestigations, maintain that these organic derangements are very seldom\r\nmet with.\r\n\r\nLawrence affirms that he had \"examined after death the heads of many\r\ninsane persons, and had hardly seen a single brain which did not exhibit\r\nobvious marks of disease;\" and he further states, \"that he feels convinced\r\nfrom his own experience, that very few heads of persons dying deranged\r\nwill be examined after death without showing diseased structure, or\r\nevident signs of increased vascular activity.\" The celebrated Morgagni\r\ngives similar results of his extensive dissections. Meckel and Jones are\r\nof the same opinion. However, Pinel, whose anatomical pursuits on the\r\nsubject were most extensive, clearly declares that he never met with any\r\nother appearance within the cavity of the skull than are observable in\r\nopening the bodies of persons who have died of apoplexy, epilepsy, nervous\r\nfevers and convulsions. Haslam, whose experience in this matter was also\r\nvery great, asserts that nothing decisive can be obtained in reference to\r\ninsanity from any variations of appearance that have hitherto been\r\ndetected in the brain. Greding observed in two hundred and sixteen\r\nmaniacal cases which he examined, the whole of whom died of disorders\r\nunconnected with their mental ailments, that three of the heads were\r\nexceedingly large, two exceedingly small; some of the skull bones were\r\nextremely thick, others peculiarly thin; in some the frontal bones were\r\nsmall and contracted, in others the temporal bones compressed and narrow.\r\n\r\nIn this confusion and clashing of opinions, when unfortunately each\r\ntheorist views, or fancies that he views, functional or organic\r\nderangements sufficiently evident (in his eyes at least) to support his\r\ndoctrine, it is no easy matter to come to a fair conclusion. It can only\r\nbe observed, that, as the wonderful sympathies of the brain with other\r\norgans especially the viscera of the abdomen, are universally\r\nacknowledged, the morbid condition in which the brain is occasionally\r\nfound may have arisen from a primary morbid condition of some other organ.\r\nHence it is difficult to say whether insanity is most generally a primary\r\nor a secondary affection. Physical causes act both upon the brain and the\r\nabdominal system. Concussion and compression of the brain will occasion\r\nnausea, vomiting, and hepatic affections, and the presence of worms in the\r\nintestines will excite convulsions and epilepsy. In regard to moral\r\ncauses, they may also act directly or indirectly upon the brain, or the\r\nparts that sympathize with it. Sudden or violent emotions are known to\r\nproduce an immediate effect upon our digestive functions, which may in\r\nturn by their sympathetic connexion act upon the brain and the mind,\r\nalthough the connexion between brain and mind is not yet proved in any\r\nconclusive manner.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a practical point of view, whatever discrepancy of opinion may\r\nprevail on this subject, I think it will be found advisable to consider\r\nmost, if not all recent cases of insanity, as arising from physical\r\ncauses, and therefore to submit the patient to such a medical treatment in\r\naddition to moral aid, as the prevalence of morbid symptoms of local\r\nderangement are more or less evident. My own experience has fully\r\nconvinced me that a morbid condition of the cerebral organ, and the\r\nviscera of the thorax and abdomen, are invariably met with, and must have\r\nproved of sufficient importance to develop symptoms which the slightest\r\nobservations might have detected. How far the organic derangement may have\r\nbeen either the cause or the result of insanity I am not prepared to say,\r\nbut they have generally borne the appearance of having originated in undue\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nOn this most important subject I feel much gratification in quoting the\r\nfollowing opinion of the experienced Pinel: \"It appears in general that\r\nthe primitive seat of insanity is in the region of the stomach and\r\nintestinal canal, and it is from this central part that mental aberration\r\nis propagated as by irradiation.\" Esquirol is of opinion that insanity\r\narises from a lesion of the vital functions of the brain, and not\r\nunfrequently from a disturbance in the various points of sensibility in\r\ndifferent parts of the system.\r\n\r\nThat mental emotions, whether producing any alteration in the physical\r\ncondition of the individual, or not, occasion various degrees of insanity,\r\nis proved by experience. The French revolution, during its execrable\r\nphases, offered a wide and fertile field of observation on this subject;\r\nand the various events that marked those fearful times were certainly well\r\ncalculated to affect any brain capable of becoming deranged. The following\r\nresults of these observations are curious: \"Among the lunatics confined at\r\nBicetre,\" says Pinel, \"during the third year of the Republic, I observed\r\nthat the exciting causes of their maladies, in a great majority of cases,\r\nwere extremely vivid affections of the mind; such as ungovernable or\r\ndisappointed ambition, religious fanaticism, profound chagrin, and\r\nunfortunate love. Out of one hundred and thirteen madmen with whose\r\nhistory I took pains to make myself acquainted, thirty-four were reduced\r\nto this state by domestic misfortunes, twenty-four by obstacles to\r\nmatrimonial union, thirty by political events, and twenty-five by\r\nreligious fanaticism. Those were chiefly affected who belonged to\r\nprofessions in which the imagination is unceasingly or ardently engaged,\r\nand not controlled in its excitement by the exercise of the tamer\r\nfunctions of the understanding, which are more susceptible of satiety and\r\nfatigue. Hence the Bicetre registers were chiefly filled from the\r\nprofessions of priests, artists, painters, sculptors, poets, and\r\nmusicians, while they contained no instances of persons whose line of life\r\ndemands a predominant exercise of the judging faculty,--not one\r\nnaturalist, physician, chemist, or geometrician.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a return of the supposed moral causes of insanity\r\nobserved in the Salpetriere.

Of physical causes hereditary madness is the most\r\nprevalent, as appears clearly from the following table extracted from the\r\nregisters of the Salpetriere.\r\n\r\n  Hereditary insanity             105\r\n  Convulsion during gestation      11\r\n  Epilepsy                         11\r\n  Female derangements              55\r\n  Diseases of child-birth          52\r\n  Critical periods                 27\r\n  Old age                          60\r\n  Insolation                       12\r\n  Injuries of the head             14\r\n  Fever                            13\r\n  Syphilis                          8\r\n  Effects of mercury               14\r\n  Worms                            24\r\n  Apoplexy                         60\r\n\r\nWhen speaking of hereditary madness, Dr. Abercrombie is of opinion that\r\nwhere a tendency to insanity exists, there may be in many cases,\r\ncircumstances in mental habits or mental discipline calculated to favour\r\nor to counteract the tendency, when the mind wanders away from the proper\r\nduties of life or luxuriates amid scenes of imagination, thus permitting\r\nmental emotions, of whatever kind, to be excited in a manner\r\ndisproportional to the true relation of the object which gave rise to\r\nthem; allowing the mind to ramble among imaginary events, or to be led\r\naway by slight and casual relations, instead of steadily exercising the\r\njudgment in the investigation of truth.\r\n\r\nThese observations are no doubt most luminous, yet as I have elsewhere\r\nremarked, hereditary predisposition to insanity may be brought into\r\naction, by the constant scenes that pass in the presence of those\r\nindividuals who may daily have to witness the aberrations of an unhappy\r\nrelative. The mind dwells on the sad subject, and it becomes a source of\r\nconstant apprehension, when the mere dread of an hereditary evil is\r\nperhaps sufficient to drive to madness. So powerful is the sway even of\r\nimaginary terror, that we need not wonder that natural fear should be\r\nproductive of results still more injurious to our intellects. There seems\r\nto exist a certain fascination in what we should dread and avoid; instead\r\nof resisting evil, by a strange fatality we seem to be self-impelled to\r\ncourt it. We indulge in thoughts, in hopes and fears, too often\r\nchimerical, instead of endeavouring to dismiss them from our mind, by\r\nother pursuits and busy occupation; and we brood upon future and ideal\r\nmiseries until we actually, from supineness and timidity, sink under their\r\noverwhelming influence.\r\n\r\nEsquirol relates some curious coincidences of hereditary insanity. A Swiss\r\nmerchant lost both his sons in a state of mania at the age of 19. A lady\r\nlost her senses after childbirth at the age of 25. Her daughter became\r\ninsane in her 25th year. In one family, the grandfather, the father, and\r\nthe son, destroyed themselves at the age of 50. Near Newton, seven insane\r\nsisters had been observed in one family. An unfortunate female in the\r\nSalpetriere, under the influence of liquor, threw herself three times in\r\nthe river and her sister in a state of intoxication drowned herself. A\r\ngentleman whose intellects became deranged in consequence of the\r\nmisfortunes of the revolution remained for ten years secluded in his\r\nchamber. His daughter became insane about the same period, and with equal\r\nobstinacy could not be prevailed upon to leave her room.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, but that were these early predispositions attended to\r\nand watched, an active course of education adopted, and change of locality\r\nresorted to, much future misery might be avoided, and possibly the\r\ninvasion of the malady arrested.\r\n\r\nIf the observations of the phrenologist are entitled to consideration, the\r\nmind may become mainly instrumental in attaining this _desideratum_, as\r\nthe detection of certain propensities may place us upon our guard in the\r\neducation of youth. This would be a point of still greater importance,\r\nwere these organs innate, dooming us to the blind law of fatality; but the\r\nphrenologists maintain, that the development of these organic inequalities\r\non the surface of the cranium are produced and developed by a\r\ncorresponding enlargement of the brain, which is greater or lesser in the\r\nratio of the preponderance of the organ as the indulgence in the\r\npropensities which they indicate.\r\n\r\nPinel relates a curious case of hereditary mania in a man who, up to the\r\nage of fifty, fulfilled with intelligence and activity the duties of an\r\nimportant office which he held. At this period he indulged in various\r\nexcesses, and sunk in the debasement of the lowest society. These excesses\r\nhe represented to his wondering friends and acquaintances as the source of\r\ndivine pleasure and celestial enjoyment. He declared that he would erect a\r\ntemple to the god of love, and officiate himself as high priest at his\r\naltars; he compared the very lowest of women to angelic creatures; and\r\nfinally was confined, a furious and desperate maniac.\r\n\r\nEducation carried on upon mistaken principles has also been known to\r\nprepare the way to insanity, and La Bruyere has justly observed, that\r\nthere are parents, the study of whose life appears to have been, their\r\ngiving their children just reason not to regret their loss. Pinel has\r\ngiven us the interesting history of two orphan brothers, who had been\r\nbrought up in a most anomalous manner--with extreme kindness and\r\neffeminacy by a nurse, and with much harshness and injustice by a tutor.\r\nThe result of this erroneous management was a deficient development in\r\ntheir intellectual faculties, and a debilitated frame, which gradually led\r\nto a state of imbecility. When examined by Pinel at the age of twenty and\r\ntwenty-two, their conversation was puerile in the extreme, and they both\r\ndisplayed a taste for infantile sports and pastimes, befitting children of\r\nthree or four years old. They sought to express themselves with great\r\nvolubility, but their language, consisting chiefly of broken syllables,\r\nwas scarcely intelligible. Notwithstanding their apathic appearance, by a\r\nsort of automatic habit, every evening brought on an absurd scene of\r\nsentimentality. They would join each other in earnest conversation in a\r\ncorner of the room; and, with bitter tears and deep sighs, bewail the loss\r\nof their parents, who had thus left them in a helpless orphan condition,\r\nin their tender years, expressing the sincerest affection for their nurse,\r\nbut speaking of their tutor with bitter imprecations. A great partiality\r\nshown to one sister has driven another one to a state of dementia, that\r\narose from her continually dwelling on the wrongs she experienced, which,\r\nof course, were exaggerated by jealousy.\r\n\r\nExternal agents producing sudden terror have been frequently known to\r\nbring on insanity. It is related of a child of three years of age, who was\r\nso terrified on being brought into a madhouse, that he was subject to\r\nhorrible dreams and visions until his seventeenth year, when he became a\r\nperfect lunatic. Women frightened during pregnancy have often become\r\nalienated; and there are two cases reported of young ladies who were found\r\ninsane the day after their nuptials.\r\n\r\nWhile disappointments and misfortunes are often the origin of insanity, a\r\nsudden melioration in circumstances, and unexpected pleasing intelligence\r\nhave been also known to derange the intellects. A man who came into the\r\npossession of a large fortune, after having lived for many years in\r\npenury, was so alarmed at the thought of losing this property, that the\r\napprehension of the evil deprived him of his senses. An instance is\r\nrecorded of a young girl, long separated from her lover by parents averse\r\nto their union, who became insane immediately after her marriage.\r\n\r\nChildren are generally exempted from this calamitous visitation; yet Frank\r\nrelates the case of a child at St. Luke's who had been deranged since he\r\nwas two years old. Age, to a certain extent, seems to influence insanity,\r\nand most individuals are alienated between their twentieth and fiftieth\r\nyears. Haslam states, that out of one thousand six hundred and sixty-four\r\npatients admitted into Bedlam, nine hundred and ten came within this\r\nperiod of life. In France it appears that most cases of insanity are\r\nnoticed between the ages of twenty-five and thirty-five. One-fifteenth of\r\nthese cases among men, and one-sixth among women, are observed before\r\ntheir twentieth year; and in the wealthy classes of society one-fourth\r\noccur before the same period.

This observation\r\nas to the influence of public events is confirmed by the following\r\nstatement of admissions in the Salpetriere during the comparatively\r\ntranquil years of 1811, 1812, 1813, and 1814, although many cases of\r\ninsanity were said to have arisen from the harsh laws of the conscription.\r\n\r\n  Years.

This may possibly arise from the\r\ngreater number of our eccentric countrymen that are widely scattered over\r\nthe globe; and whenever an individual is observed whose manners and\r\nconduct are totally at variance with the habits of any other member of the\r\ncommunity, he is generally considered an Englishman. Voltaire came to the\r\nsweeping conclusion that one half of the nation was scrofulous, and the\r\nother moiety insane.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would appear that insanity is on the increase; for in the\r\nreport of the commissioners for licensing lunatic establishments we find\r\nthe following statement: \"Insanity appears to have been _considerably_ on\r\nthe increase; for if we compare the sums of two distant lustra, the one\r\nbeginning with 1775, and the other ending with 1809, the proportion of\r\npatients returned as having been received into lunatic asylums during the\r\nlatter period, is to that of the former nearly as one hundred and\r\ntwenty-nine to one hundred.\" Dr. Burrows has endeavoured to impugn the\r\ncorrectness of this statement by proving that suicide is more frequent in\r\nother countries; now, unless Dr. Burrows can prove that suicide is always\r\nan act of insanity, which will by no means be admitted, his observation\r\ncan bear no weight.\r\n\r\nIt is but too true that in melancholy madness we often observe a\r\nprevailing propensity to self-destruction. Dr. Abercrombie's views on this\r\nsubject are so luminous that I shall transcribe them.\r\n\r\n\"When the melancholic hallucination has fully taken possession of the\r\nmind, it becomes the sole object of attention, without the power of\r\nvarying the impression, or of directing the thoughts to any facts or\r\nconsiderations calculated to remove or palliate it. The evil seems\r\noverwhelming and irremediable, admitting neither of palliation,\r\nconsolation, nor hope. For the process of mind calculated to diminish such\r\nan impression, or even to produce a hope of the palliation of the evil, is\r\nprecisely that exercise of mind which in this singular condition, is lost\r\nor suspended; namely, a power of changing the subject of thought, of\r\ntransferring the attention to other facts and considerations, and of\r\ncomparing the mental impression with these, and with the actual state of\r\nexternal things. Under such a conviction of overwhelming and hopeless\r\nmisery, the feeling naturally arises of life being a burden, and this is\r\nsucceeded by a determination to quit it. When such an association has once\r\nbeen formed, it also fixes itself upon the mind, and fails to be corrected\r\nby those considerations which ought to remove it. That it is in this\r\nmanner the impression arises, and not from any process analogous to the\r\ndetermination of a sound mind, appears, among other circumstances, from\r\nthe singular manner in which it is often dissipated, namely by the\r\naccidental productions of some new impression not calculated in any degree\r\nto influence the subject of thought, but simply to give a momentary\r\ndirection of the mind to some other feeling. Thus a man mentioned by Pinel\r\nhad left his house in the night, with the determined resolution of\r\ndrowning himself, when he was attacked by robbers. He did his best to\r\nescape from them, and having done so, returned home, the resolution of\r\nsuicide being entirely dissipated. A woman mentioned, I believe by Dr.\r\nBurrows, had her resolution changed in the same manner, by something\r\nfalling on her head, after she had gone out for a similar purpose.\r\n\r\n\"A very irregular modification occurs in some of these cases. With the\r\nearnest desire of death, there is combined an impression of the\r\ncriminality of suicide; but this instead of correcting the hallucination,\r\nonly leads to another and most extraordinary mode of effecting the\r\npurpose; namely by committing murder, and so dying by the hand of justice.\r\nSeveral instances are on record in which this remarkable mental process\r\nwas distinctly traced and acknowledged; and in which there was no mixture\r\nof malice against the individuals who were murdered. On the contrary,\r\nthese were generally children; and in one of the cases, the maniac\r\ndistinctly avowed his resolution to commit murder, with the view of dying\r\nby a sentence of law; and at the same time his determination that his\r\nvictim should be a child, as he should thus avoid the additional guilt of\r\nsending a person out of the world in a state of unrepented sin. The mental\r\nprocess in such a case presents a most interesting subject of reflection.\r\nIt appears to be purely a process of association, without the power of\r\nreasoning. I should suppose that there had been at a former period, during\r\na comparatively healthy state of the mental faculties, a repeated\r\ncontemplation of suicide which had been always checked by an immediate\r\ncontemplation of its dreadful criminality.\r\n\r\nIn this manner a strong connexion had been formed, which when the idea of\r\nsuicide afterwards came into the mind, during the state of insanity, led\r\nto the impression of its heinousness, not by a process of reasoning, but\r\nby simple association. The subsequent steps are the distorted reasonings\r\nof insanity, mixed with some previous impression of the safe condition of\r\nchildren dying in infancy. This explanation I think is strongly\r\ncountenanced by the consideration that, had the idea of the criminality of\r\nsuicide been in any degree a process of reasoning, a corresponding\r\nconviction of the guilt of murder must have followed it. I find, however,\r\none case which is at variance with this hypothesis. The reasoning of that\r\nunfortunate individual was, that if he committed murder, and died by the\r\nhand of justice, there would be time for his making his peace with the\r\nalmighty between the crime and his execution, which would not be the case\r\nif he should die by suicide. This was a species of reasoning but it was\r\npurely the reasoning of insanity.\"\r\n\r\nStill these remarks do not go to prove that suicide is always the result\r\nof insanity, since it can in most instances be attributed to a moment of\r\ndespair and impatience under a heavy visitation of calamity, or the dread\r\nof contempt of society. The frequency of this rash act, cannot therefore\r\nbe adduced as a proof of the greater prevalence of madness in any country.\r\nWith greater reason, self-destruction is to be referred to the want of a\r\nproper religious education and feeling, which will enable man to bear up\r\nagainst the world's vicissitudes, and deem life a more or less painful\r\njourney to a peaceful abode.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu was one of the many writers who attributed this propensity as\r\nbeing nearly exclusive to the English. \"Les Anglais,\" he says, \"se tuent\r\nsans qu'on puisse imaginer aucune raison qui les y determine; ils se tuent\r\ndans le sens meme du bonheur. Cette action, chez les Romains etait l'effet\r\nde l'education, elle tenait a leur maniere de penser et a leurs coutumes;\r\ndans les Anglais c'est l'effet d'une maladie, elle tient a l'etat physique\r\nde la machine.\"\r\n\r\nTwo very curious works on suicide have been lately published in Germany by\r\nDr. Arntzenius and Dr. Schlegel. The former writer divides this fatal\r\npropensity into acute and chronic; the first marked by great physical\r\nexcitement, the latter accompanied or preceded by sadness, moroseness, and\r\nlove of solitude. Curious cases are related in illustration of this\r\ndoctrine, amongst others we remark that of an English nobleman who cast\r\nhimself into the crater of Vesuvius. A German in the same year, not being\r\nable perhaps to travel so far, threw himself into a smelting furnace.\r\nSeveral cases are recorded of individuals who formed the desperate\r\nresolution of starving themselves. It appears that in many instances the\r\nmost trifling circumstance has driven these reckless beings to the\r\ncommission of this desperate action. The case of a young Parisian author\r\nof the name of Escoupe, who suffocated himself because one of his dramatic\r\nproductions had been severely criticised, is well known. A German student\r\ndestroyed himself because he had a club-foot, and another youth put an end\r\nto his existence in consequence of his not having been allowed to put on\r\nhis Sunday clothes. Dr. Schlegel has given a curious table of the means of\r\ndestruction resorted to according to the several ages of individuals, and\r\nwe give the following abstract:\r\n\r\n                                   By pistol.  By hanging.\r\n  Between 10 and 20 years of age.      61          68\r\n      \"   20-30          \"            283          51\r\n      \"   30-40          \"            182          94\r\n      \"   40-50          \"            150         188\r\n      \"   50-60          \"            161         256\r\n      \"   60-70          \"            126         235\r\n      \"   70-80          \"             35         108\r\n      \"   80-90          \"              2\r\n                                     ----        ----\r\n                                     1000        1000\r\n\r\nIn classing 9000 cases of suicide which happened in Paris between the\r\nyears 1796 and 1830, Dr. Schlegel concludes that what he terms the\r\n\"philosophic suicide,\" is that which is perpetrated after deliberation,\r\nduring the night or shortly before sunrise; whilst when it is not the\r\nresult of premeditation, it occurs during the day.\r\n\r\nThe choice between shooting and hanging may be accounted for on the same\r\ngrounds. A young man, in a fit of frantic passion, from disappointed love,\r\nor losses at play, will probably, on his return home, seize a pistol and\r\nblow out his brains; whereas hanging needs reflection and some preparation\r\nand precaution, which would alone suffice to bring a reflective creature\r\nto a proper sense of his folly, unless predetermined to destroy himself by\r\n\"philosophic suicide.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears in these accounts that suicide in France has greatly increased\r\nsince the revolution. The average number during the last forty-two years\r\nbeing 409-5/6, the number in Paris being 1639 annually. Dr. Schlegel\r\ninforms us that there exists a society in Paris called, \"Society of the\r\nFriends of Suicide.\" It consists of twelve members, and a lot is cast\r\nannually to decide which of them is to destroy himself in the presence of\r\nthe others. Certain qualifications and testimonials were required before a\r\ncandidate could be admitted into this amiable club:\r\n\r\n1. He must prove himself a man of honour.\r\n\r\n2. He must have experienced the injustice of mankind, been injured by a\r\ndear friend, or betrayed by a mistress or a wife.\r\n\r\n3. He must have experienced, for some considerable time, a miserable\r\nvacuity of soul, and a discontent with every thing in the world.\r\n\r\nThis association reminds me of a ball that was established in Paris after\r\nthe reign of terror, called _Le Bal des Victimes_, to which no person\r\ncould be admitted unless they had had a near relation guillotined.\r\n\r\nDr. Schlegel has also given the following statistical table of the\r\nproportion of suicides to various populations--both as regarding counties\r\nand principal cities:\r\n\r\n  _Countries._           _Proportion of suicides to population._\r\n\r\n  Sweden                              1 in  92,375\r\n  The Milanais                        1 ... 72,570\r\n  Russia, 1819-1820                   1 ... 36,860\r\n  ----    1824-1827                   1 ... 34,246\r\n  Prussia                             1 ... 14,224\r\n  Saxony                              1 ...  8,446\r\n  St. Petersburg                      1 ...    416\r\n  London, 18th century                1 ... 10,572\r\n  ----    19th century                1 ... 21,491\r\n  Paris                               1 ...  2,215\r\n  Geneva                              1 ...  3,714\r\n  Berlin, 1788-1797                   1 ... 23,066\r\n  ----    1798-1807                   1 ... 12,917\r\n  ----    1813-1822                   1 ...  3,312\r\n  Hamburg                             1 ...  4,800\r\n  Leipzig                             1 ...  3,143\r\n  Milan                               1 ...  1,821\r\n  Naples                              1 ... 27,230\r\n  New York                            1 ...  9,474\r\n  Baltimore                           1 ... 15,696\r\n  Philadelphia                        1 ... 20,000\r\n\r\nAccording to our ingenious author, drunkenness is the chief cause of\r\nsuicide in England, Prussia, and Germany; love and gambling in France;\r\nwhilst bigotry, or the fear of dying without having received the\r\nsacrament, he supposes, prevents it in Spain, where, comparatively\r\nspeaking, suicide is seldom heard of.\r\n\r\nThe same remark may apply to Italy, where a Roman lady, having heard of\r\nsuch an action, exclaimed, \"_Dev' essere un forestiere; gli Italiani non\r\nsono tanto matti_.\" She was right, the suicide was a melancholy German\r\ntailor.\r\n\r\nIn India, where the doctrine of predestination is generally prevalent, it\r\nis calculated that in one year there were forty suicides in a population\r\nof 250,000, twenty-three of which were females.\r\n\r\nArntzenius quotes Gall's opinion, that suicide arises from too great a\r\npredominance of the organ of cautiousness. Combe and other phrenologists\r\nare of opinion, that with this predominance a deficient development of\r\nhope and a large destructiveness must be conjoined.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that in Spain and Portugal, where insanity is\r\ncomparatively rare, malconformation of the brain and consequent idiotism\r\nare very frequent.\r\n\r\nSince the peace it may be more difficult to arrive at any conclusion on\r\nthe subject of increase of lunacy, founded on the admission of lunatics\r\ninto public and private establishments, since emigration has carried so\r\nmany families and operatives of every description abroad, many of whom,\r\nfrom various disappointments and vexations, might have been predisposed to\r\ninsanity.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in 1836 there existed in England and Wales 6402 lunatics,\r\n7265 idiots--13,667 lunatics and idiots. Of paupers alone, or lunatics and\r\nidiots, there were 1.00098 of the total population, or 1 in 1024.\r\n\r\nHowever, according to the most probable calculation, the number of\r\nlunatics in England amounts to about 14,000, out of which about 11,000 are\r\npaupers. Idiots are nearly as numerous as lunatics. Sir A. Halliday states\r\nthe former to amount to 5741, and the latter to 6806. To this it must be\r\nobserved that many harmless idiots are allowed to remain in their usual\r\nresidence. In Wales it appears that idiots are to lunatics in the\r\nproportion of seven to one. The difficulty of obtaining any certain\r\ninformation on this subject, however, is such, that it is scarcely\r\npossible to decide the question with any chance of a probable certainty.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the prevalence of lunacy in other countries, the following\r\nare curious statistical statements:\r\n\r\nIn Spain, in 1817, according to the report of Dr. Luzuriaga, there only\r\nexisted in the asylums of Toledo, Granada, Cordova, Valencia, Cadiz,\r\nSaragossa, and Barcelona, 509 lunatics--only fifty were in the hospitals\r\nof Cadiz, sixty in that of Madrid, and thirty-six in the kingdom of\r\nGranada.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, in twenty-five asylums in Turin, Genoa, Milan, Brescia, Verona,\r\nVenice, Parma, Modena, Bologna, Ferrara, Florence, Sienna, Lucca, and\r\nRome, Mr. Brierre only found 3441 patients. The population of these parts\r\nof Italy amounting to about 16,789,000 inhabitants, which gives one\r\nlunatic to 4879 persons.\r\n\r\nScott, who accompanied Lord Macartney's embassy to China, observed that\r\nvery few insane persons were to be found there. Humboldt states that\r\nmadness is rare amongst the natives of South America. Carr made the same\r\nremark in Russia. In Spain and Italy, religious melancholy, and that most\r\nvexatious species of insanity called _erotomania_, are the more common.\r\n\r\nIn the savage tribes of Africa and America insanity is very rare. Dr.\r\nWinterbotham affirms, that among the Africans near Sierra Leone, mania is\r\na disease which seldom if ever occurs. Idiotism was likewise a rare\r\nphenomenon among them. Among the negro slaves in the West Indies it is\r\nscarcely known, and during three years' residence in the Bahamas, only one\r\ncase of monomania fell under my observation. Amongst the native races of\r\nAmerica it scarcely exists. From these observations we may conclude, with\r\nEsquirol, that insanity belongs almost exclusively to civilized races of\r\nmen, that it scarcely exists among savages, and is rare in barbarous\r\ncountries. To what circumstance are we to attribute this exemption?\r\nPossibly it may be attributed to simplicity in living, which predisposes\r\nto less disease and morbid varieties of organization, and to the absence\r\nof that refined education which exposes man to the artificial wants and\r\nmiseries of high civilization. It is moreover probable that the constant\r\noccupation which the existence of the savage requires to satisfy his\r\nabsolute necessities, does not leave him leisure time to ponder over\r\ngloomy ideas and fictitious sufferings. In addition to these\r\ncircumstances, Dr. Pritchard has justly remarked, that we might also\r\nconjecture that congenital predisposition is wanting in the offspring of\r\nuncivilized races. The same author admits the probability of the brain\r\nreceiving a different development in the progeny of cultivated races, or\r\nof those whose mental faculties have been awakened.\r\n\r\nVarious professions have been supposed to exercise much influence on the\r\nintellectual faculties. The following observations at the Salpetriere\r\nduring one year may tend to illustrate this subject:\r\n\r\n  Field labourers                       43\r\n  Servants                              51\r\n  Needlework women                      85\r\n  Cooks                                 16\r\n  Shopkeepers                           21\r\n  Pedlars                               16\r\n  Shoemakers                             8\r\n  House-painters and varnishers          5\r\n  Housekeepers                         192\r\n  Women of the town                     33\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Esquirol's establishment:\r\n\r\n  Farmers                                3\r\n  Military men                          33\r\n  Seamen                                 3\r\n  Merchants                             50\r\n  Students                              25\r\n  Clerks in public offices              21\r\n  Engineers                              2\r\n  Lawyers                               11\r\n  Chemists                               4\r\n  Physicians                             4\r\n  Artists                                8\r\n\r\nAccording to the prevalence of the ideas connected with their former\r\npursuits do we observe the hallucination of these unfortunate persons to\r\nbe of a different character. Dr. Abercrombie relates the case of a Scotch\r\nclergyman, who was brought before a jury to be what is called in Scotland\r\n_cognosced_, or declared incapable of managing his affairs. Amongst the\r\nacts of extravagance alleged against him was, that he had burnt his\r\nlibrary. When he was asked by the jury what account he would give of this\r\npart of his conduct, he replied in the following terms: \"In the early part\r\nof my life I had imbibed a liking for a most unprofitable study, namely,\r\ncontroversial divinity. On reviewing my library, I found a great part of\r\nit to consist of books of this description, and I was so anxious that my\r\nfamily should not be led to follow the same pursuits, that I determined to\r\nburn the whole.\" He gave answers equally plausible to questions which\r\nwere put to him respecting other parts of his conduct; and the result was,\r\nthat the jury found no sufficient ground for cognoscing him; but in the\r\ncourse of a fortnight from that time, he was in a state of decided mania.\r\n\r\nWhat a school of humility is a lunatic asylum! What a field of observation\r\ndoes it not present to the philosopher who ranges among its inmates! We\r\nfind the same aberrations that obtain in society; similar errors, similar\r\npassions, similar miserable self-tormenting chimeras, empty pride,\r\nworthless vanity, and overweening ambition. There we\r\n\r\n  See that noble and most sovereign reason,\r\n  Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh.\r\n\r\nEach madhouse has its gods and priests, its sovereigns and its subjects,\r\nterrific mimicry of worldly superstitions, pomp, pride, and degradation!\r\nThere, tyranny rules with iron sway, until the keeper's appearance makes\r\ntyrants know there does exist a power still greater than their own. In\r\nmadhouses egotism prevails as generally as in the world, and nothing\r\naround the lunatic sheds any influence unless relating to his wretched\r\nself. In this struggle between the mind and body, this constant action and\r\nreaction of the moral and the corporeal energies, when reason has yielded\r\nto the brute force of animal passions, and the body with all its baseness\r\nhas triumphed over the soul, one cannot but think of Plutarch's fanciful\r\nidea, that, should the body sue the mind for damages before a court of\r\njustice, it would be found that the defendant had been a ruinous tenant to\r\nthe plaintiff.\r\n\r\nIn many cases of insanity we observe a singular fertility of glowing\r\nimagination and a vivacity of memory which is often surprising. Dr. Willis\r\nmentions a patient who was subject to occasional attacks of insanity, and\r\nwho assured him that he expected the paroxysms with impatience, as they\r\nproved to him a source of considerable delight. \"Every thing,\" he said,\r\n\"appeared easy to me. No obstacles presented themselves either in theory\r\nor in practice. My memory acquired of a sudden a singular degree of\r\nperfection. Long passages of Latin authors occurred to my mind. In general\r\nI have great difficulty in finding rhythmical terminations, but then I\r\ncould write verse with as much facility as prose.\"\r\n\r\nOld associations thus recalled into the mind are often mixed up with\r\nrecent occurrences, in the same manner as in dreaming. Dr. Gooch mentions\r\na lady who became insane in consequence of an alarm of fire in her\r\nneighbourhood. She imagined that she was transformed into the Virgin Mary,\r\nand that a luminous halo beamed round her head.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the Egyptians placed a mummy at their festive board, to\r\nremind man of mortality. Would not a frequent visit to a lunatic asylum\r\nafford a wholesome lesson to the reckless despot, the proud statesman, and\r\nthe arbitrary chieftain? There they might converse with tyrants,\r\npoliticians, and self-created heroes, in all the naked turpitude of the\r\nevil passions, who in their frantic gestures would show them that which\r\nthey wish to be--that which the world considers they are! Often would they\r\nhear the maniac express the very thoughts that ruffle their own pillows,\r\nuntil the dreaded bell that announces the doctor's visit, and which with\r\none loud peal destroys his fond illusions, herald of that knell which\r\nsooner or later must call them from the busy world they think their own.\r\nHow beautifully has Filmer expressed the madman's fears!\r\n\r\n  See yon old miser laden with swelling bags\r\n  Of ill-got gold, with how much awkward haste\r\n  He limps away to shelter! See how he ducks,\r\n  And dives, and dodges with the gods; and all\r\n  Only in hope to avoid, for some few days\r\n  Perhaps, the just reward of his own sad extortions.\r\n  The hot adulterer, now all chill and impotent\r\n  With fear, leaps from the polluted bed,\r\n  And crams himself into a cranny!\r\n  There mighty men of blood, who make a trade\r\n  Of murder, forget their wonted fierceness;\r\n  Out-nois'd, they shrink aside, and shake for fear\r\n  O' th' louder threat'nings of the angry gods.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the nature of insanity or our fallacious views regarding\r\nit, it is a matter of great consolation to find that our mode of treating\r\nit is at last founded on rational and humane principles. The unfortunate\r\nlunatic is no longer an object of horror and disgust, chained down like a\r\nwild beast, and sunk by ignorance or avarice, even below the level of that\r\ndegradation in the scale of human beings, to which it had pleased\r\nProvidence to reduce him,--we no longer behold him rising from his foul\r\nand loathsome bed of straw, scantily covered with filthy tatters, his hair\r\nand beard wild and grisly--his eyes under the influence of constant\r\nexcitement, darting menacing looks--the foam bubbling through his gnashing\r\nteeth--clanking his fetters with angry words and gestures, threatening\r\nheaven and earth--gazed at with dismay, through massive bars--the very\r\nfemale seeming of doubtful sex:\r\n\r\n                Her unregarded locks\r\n  Matted like fury-tresses, her poor limbs\r\n  Chain'd to the ground; and stead of those delights\r\n  Which happy lovers taste, her keeper's stripes,\r\n  A bed of straw, and a coarse wooden dish\r\n  Of wretched sustenance.[18]\r\n\r\nNow, the unfortunate persons are restored to social life as much as their\r\nsad condition allows; they enjoy every comfort that can solace them in\r\ntheir lucid intervals, when their hallucinations cease; in illness they\r\nare treated with kindness and liberality, and in health, their former\r\nassociations with the busy world, are recalled by labour, voluntarily\r\nperformed or stimulated by the incentive of some additional comfort. No\r\ncoercion is resorted to, except to prevent the furious maniac from\r\ninjuring himself and others, and then, such means are adopted that\r\nrestrain his violence without a painful process. Even the straight\r\nwaistcoat, which impedes respiration, is generally banished in all\r\nwell-regulated establishments, and belts, sleeves, and muffs, which merely\r\nsecure the hands, without preventing a free motion of the articulations,\r\nare usually resorted to. To such an extent is healthy occupation carried\r\non in lunatic asylums, that at this moment at Hanwell, out of upwards of\r\n600 inmates under my care, 421 are at work and distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  _Males._\r\n\r\n    57 Working in the garden and grounds.\r\n    53 Handicrafts at various trades.\r\n    38 Assistants in the wards.\r\n    28 Picking coir, or the external fibre of the cocoa-nut,\r\n         for stuffing mattresses, &c.\r\n     2 Clerks in the office.\r\n  ----\r\n   178\r\n  ----\r\n\r\n  _Females._\r\n\r\n   120 At needlework.\r\n     2 Making brushes.\r\n    21 In the kitchen and dairy.\r\n    21 Assisting in the wards.\r\n    26 Picking coir.\r\n    30 Working in the garden.\r\n    23 In the laundry.\r\n  ----\r\n   243\r\n  ----\r\n\r\nHanwell may be said to be an asylum for incurables, since it is doomed to\r\nreceive old cases that scarcely ever afford a chance of recovery; to which\r\nare added a large proportion of the idiots and epileptics of Middlesex,\r\nwhose families cannot support them.\r\n\r\nLet us hope from this gradual amelioration in the condition of this\r\nillfated class of our fellow-creatures, that every institution, both\r\npublic and private, will shortly be conducted upon a similar plan, having\r\nsufficient grounds attached to it, to give occupation to such of their\r\ninmates as may still be able to enjoy some share, however trifling it may\r\nbe, of the blessings of this life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPROSY.\r\n\r\n\r\nBontius informs us that this disease was observed on the banks of the\r\nGanges, where it was known by the name of _Cowrap_. Kaempfer noticed it in\r\nCeylon and Japan. In Sumatra, whole generations are infected with both\r\nleprosy and elephantiasis; and those who are labouring under the latter\r\ndisease, although it is not contagious, are driven into the woods.\r\nChristopher Columbus found lepers in the island of Buona Vista in 1498,\r\nand frictions of turtle blood were used to relieve them.\r\n\r\nIn our days it is a disease of rare occurrence, at least in Europe; yet it\r\nwas observed at Vetrolles and Martignes, in France, in 1808, and at Pigua\r\nand Castel Franco, in Italy, in 1807. The elephantiasis still prevails in\r\nour West India colonies, more especially that species which is called\r\n\"elephant leg,\" and which is not uncommon at Barbadoes, St. Christopher,\r\nand Nevis. Parsons, in his Travels in Asia and Africa, informs us that a\r\nsimilar complaint exists on the coast of Malabar, where it is called the\r\n\"Cochin leg.\" The Hindoo physicians treat it with pills of arsenic and\r\nblack pepper.\r\n\r\nA curious species of leprosy appeared in Rome under the reign of Tiberius,\r\nwhich was brought thither from Asia. The eruption first broke out upon the\r\nchin, whence it was called _Mentagra_, and is thus alluded to by Martial:\r\n\r\n  Non ulcus acre, pustulaeve lucentes;\r\n  Nec triste mentum, sordidive lichenes.\r\n\r\nFrom the chin it extended over the entire body, and on its disappearance\r\nleft scars more unsightly, if possible, than the former disease. Its\r\nvirulence and difficulty of cure induced the Romans to send to Egypt for\r\nattendance. The same disease prevailed in the second century, and Soranus,\r\na physician of Aquitania, was sent for to heal it. Crispus, a friend of\r\nGalen, is said to have discovered the best method of cure. Pliny has given\r\nan accurate account of the mentagra in his Natural History, lib. xxvii.\r\ncap. 1. According to the same writer, elephantiasis was brought to Rome by\r\nPompey's troops. Plutarch fixes its apparition to the time when\r\nAsclepiades of Bithynia flourished as one of his disciples. Themison wrote\r\na treatise on the disease, which is mentioned by Caelius Aurelianus, but\r\nhas not been preserved from the ravages of time. Lucilius called the\r\naffection _odiosa Vitiligo_. The _Gemursa_ of Pliny appears to have been a\r\nsimilar complaint; and Triller thinks that it was the _Gumretha_ of the\r\nTalmud.\r\n\r\nFormerly, in England, the causes of lepers were committed to the\r\necclesiastical courts, as it was prohibited to prosecute a leper before a\r\nlay judge, as they were under the protection of the church, which\r\nseparated them from the rest of the people by a ritual. At this period a\r\nlaw existed, called _Leproso amovendo_, for the removal of lepers who\r\nventured to mix in society. Thus leprosy may be considered one of the most\r\nterrific maladies inflicted on mankind. Holy Writ affords us abundant\r\nproofs of its fatal character. It is probable that this disease was first\r\nobserved under the scorching sun of Egypt, whence it spread its ravages to\r\nGreece and Asia; and when the East was obliged to submit to the Roman\r\nlegions, the conquerors carried the scourge of the vanquished to their own\r\ncountry. From Italy the disorder extended to France; and in the reign of\r\nPhilip I. we find some members of the church militant, called\r\n_hospitaliers_, who spent their arduous life in attending upon lepers, and\r\nwaging war against the infidels.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew tribes, on quitting Egypt, were subject to three kinds of\r\nleprosy; all of them were distinguished by the name of _Berat_ ([Hebrew]),\r\nor \"bright spot.\" One called _Boak_ ([Hebrew]), of a dull white; and two\r\nnamed _Tsorat_ ([Hebrew]), or \"venom or malignity:\" the first variety of\r\nthe latter being the _Berat Lebena_, or bright white berat; and the next\r\nthe _Berat Cecha_, or the dark and dusky berat; both of which were highly\r\ncontagious, and rendered those who laboured under their attack unclean,\r\nand dangerous to society.\r\n\r\nManetho, Justin, and several historians, pretend that the Hebrews were\r\nexpelled from Egypt in consequence of their being infected with this\r\nformidable disease; a reproach from which Josephus attempted to exculpate\r\nhis countrymen. It appears, however, that, during their captivity of one\r\nhundred and thirty-four years, the Israelites laboured under this awful\r\nvisitation; and, three thousand years after their migration we find\r\nProsper Alpinus describing the banks of the Nile as the principal seat of\r\nthe disease. Lucretius gives the same account of it:\r\n\r\n  Est Elephas morbus, qui, propter flumina Nili\r\n  Gignitur, Aegypto in media, neque praeterea usquam.\r\n\r\nPliny and Marcellus Empiricus refer the calamity to the same source. They\r\nstate, however, that it was more general in the lower classes, although it\r\nsometimes attacked their sovereigns; an event which added to the horrors\r\nof the infliction, since it appears that royalty had the privilege of\r\nbathing in human blood as one of the most effectual curative means. Gaul\r\nand Avicenna attribute its fatal prevalence in Alexandria to the influence\r\nof the climate, and the quality of their food. The Persian writer thus\r\nexpresses himself: \"Et quando aggregatur caliditas aeris cum malitia cibi,\r\net ejus essentia ex genere piscium, et carne salita, et carne grossa, et\r\ncarnibus asinorum, et lentibus, procul dubio est ut eveniat lepra, sicut\r\nmultiplicatur in Alexandria.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Boak_, or slighter berat, which is not considered to be contagious,\r\nstill bears the same denomination amongst the Arabs, and is the [Greek:\r\nlepra alphos] or dull white leprosy of the Greeks. The bright white and\r\ndusky berats of the Hebrews were distinguished on account of their\r\nmalignity, and with the _Tsorat_ ([Hebrew]) are still called among the\r\nArabians by the Hebrew generic term with a very slight alteration, for the\r\n_Berat Lebena_ is their _Beras Bejas_, and the _Berat Cecha_, the _Beras\r\nAsved_.\r\n\r\nWhile the Arabians borrowed the Hebrew terms, the Greeks took their\r\ndenominations from the same source; and from _Tsorat_ they adopted the\r\nword _Psora_. The _Tsorat_ is restrained by the Hebrews to the contagious\r\nform of leprosy. Amongst the Greeks Lepra was a generic synonyme of\r\n_Berat_ or _Beras_.\r\n\r\nThis confusion in the adaptation of the names given to the varieties of\r\nleprosy has occasioned much perplexity in the study of the disease.\r\nActuarius, in endeavouring to rectify these errors, has produced a greater\r\nconfusion. According to him, they are different forms of a common genus.\r\nHowever, the most important distinction was that which defined the\r\ncontagious and the non-contagious forms. The leprosy described by Moses\r\nunder the name of _Boak_ or _Bohak_ was the [Greek: alphos] of\r\nHippocrates; _Seeth_ the [Greek: phakos]; _Saphachath_ and _Misphachath_\r\nthe [Greek: leichen]; and _Bahereth_ the [Greek: leuke]; and according to\r\nCarthenser and other writers, this leprosy was the _Leuce_ of the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe elephantiasis was long confounded with leprosy; but the former is a\r\ntubercular affection of the skin, widely different from the scaly leprosy,\r\nand certainly not contagious. Its singular name was derived from the\r\ncondition of the surface of the huge misshapen limbs of those who were\r\naffected with the malady, and which bore some resemblance to the leg of an\r\nelephant. This morbid state is not uncommon in the island of Barbadoes,\r\nand in England it has been called \"the Barbadoes leg.\" The original Arabic\r\nname for this affection was _Dal Fil_, or \"the elephant's disease,\" which\r\nis now the common denomination; although it is frequently abridged into\r\n_Fil_ alone, literally _Elephas_. The elephantiasis is not even alluded to\r\nby Moses in his descriptions of leprosy. However, the elephant leg of the\r\nArabians is a disease totally different from the specific elephantiasis,\r\nwhich is a disorder of the skin, the roughness of which led to the name,\r\nand which the Arabians called _Juzam_ or _Judam_.\r\n\r\nThese errors of description amongst medical writers have of course\r\noccasioned much obscurity and perplexity in the productions of travellers\r\nand historians, who have generally confounded all these diseases with the\r\nHebrew leprosy, or the leprosy which for so long a period desolated the\r\nfairest portions of Europe, where every country was crowded with hospitals\r\nestablished for the exclusive relief of the malady. The number of\r\nleper-houses, as they were denominated, has been singularly exaggerated.\r\nParis has been made to assert that there were nineteen thousand of these\r\nhospitals, whereas he merely stated that the Knights Hospitalers, under\r\nvarious patron saints, but more particularly St. Lazarus, were endowed\r\nwith nineteen thousand manors to support their extensive establishments;\r\nand he thus clearly expressed himself: \"_Habent Hospitalarii novemdecim\r\nmillia maneriorum in Christianitate_.\" It appears that in the reign of\r\nLouis VIII., France had no less than two thousand of these hospitals.\r\nLeprosy was well known in the eighth century, and St. Ottomar and St.\r\nNicholas, were considered the first founders of establishments for its\r\ntreatment in France and in Germany. The Crusaders, however, by their\r\nconnexions with the East, materially increased its inroads in Europe, and\r\nthe disgusting malady appears to have been considered as a proof of\r\nholiness. Moehser, in his work \"_De medicis equestri dignitate\r\nornatis_,\" informs us that the Knights of the order of St. Lazarus were\r\nnot only intrusted with the care of lepers, but admitted them into their\r\nnoble order: their Grand Master was himself a leper. The Crusaders,\r\nreturning from their useless wars, eaten up with the disease, received the\r\nhonourable distinction of being _pauperes Christi, morbi beati Lazari\r\nlanguentes_. The most distinguished individuals in the land attended upon\r\nthem with the utmost humility; and Robert, King of France, used to wash\r\nand kiss their filthy feet to keep himself in odour of sanctity. All these\r\nattentions, however, did not always prevent the lepers from complaining of\r\ntheir complicated sufferings, but they were exhorted by holy men (who of\r\ncourse had never experienced the miseries of the malady) to be of good\r\ncomfort, as their illness was a blessed favour conferred upon them as the\r\nelect of the land. St. Louis thought the Sire de Joinville an unbeliever;\r\nfor having once asked him which he would prefer, being a _mezieu_ or\r\n_laide_ (a leper), or having to reproach his conscience with any mortal\r\nsin, his favourite replied to the singular question, that he would rather\r\nbe guilty of thirty deadly sins; whereupon the sanctified monarch severely\r\nrebuked him by telling him in the quaint language of the times, \"Nulle si\r\nlaide mezeuerie n'est, comme de estre en peche mortel.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sanctity of their disease, lepers were by various laws\r\nseparated from the healthy portion of the community. The ceremonies used\r\non these occasions were curious; and we find the following description of\r\nthem in the History of Bretagne: A priest in his sacerdotal robes went to\r\nthe leper's dwelling, bearing a crucifix. He was then exhorted to submit\r\nwith resignation to the affliction: he afterwards threw holy water upon\r\nhim, and conducted him to church. There he was stripped of his ordinary\r\nvestments, and clothed in a black garment; he then knelt down to hear\r\nmass, and was again sprinkled with holy water. During these ceremonies,\r\nthe office for the dead was duly sung, and the leper was finally led to\r\nhis destined future residence. Here he again knelt, received salutary\r\nexhortations to be patient, while a shovelful of earth was thrown on his\r\nfeet. His dwelling was most diminutive: his furniture consisted of a bed,\r\na water-jug, a chest, a table, a chair, a lamp, and a towel. He further\r\nreceived a cowl, a gown, a leathern girdle, a small cag with a funnel, a\r\nknife, a spoon, a wand, and a pair of _cliquettes_, (a sort of castanets,)\r\nto announce his approach. Before leaving him, the priest added another\r\nblessing to these gifts, and departed, after commanding him under the\r\nseverest penalties never to appear without his distinctive apparel, and\r\nbarefooted; never to enter a church, a mill, or a baker's shop; to perform\r\nall his ablutions in streams and running waters; never to touch any\r\narticle he wanted to purchase, except with his wand; never to enter\r\ndrinking-houses, but to buy his liquor at their doors, having it poured\r\ninto his barrel by means of the funnel graciously given him for that\r\npurpose; never to answer any question unless he was to windward of his\r\ninterlocutor; never to presume to take a walk in a narrow lane; never to\r\ntouch or go near children, or look at a good-looking wench; and only to\r\neat, drink, and junket with his brother lepers; and invariably to announce\r\nhis unwelcome approach by rattling his castanets.\r\n\r\nThe offsprings of these sequestrated creatures were seldom baptized; and\r\nwhen this rite was performed, the water was thrown away. After this\r\noration his ghostly adviser took his final leave, and the patient's former\r\ndwelling was burnt to the ground. The sepulchre of St. Mein, in Britanny,\r\nwas frequently visited by these poor creatures; and on such occasions they\r\nwere obliged to have both their hands covered with woollen bags, as a\r\ndistinguishing mark amongst the other pilgrims. Lepers were only allowed\r\nto intermarry with fellow-sufferers; yet we find in one of the Decretals\r\nof St. Gregory, that any woman who chose to run the chances of contagion\r\ncould please her fancy. St. Gregory perhaps thought this the most\r\neffectual method of preventing the dreaded intercourse, as most probably,\r\nhad it been prohibited, lepers would have been in great request, they\r\nhaving always been notorious for their amorous propensities. Muratori\r\ninforms us that these unfortunate persons did not always submit quietly to\r\nthese severe regulations, but several times joined the Jews in a revolt\r\nagainst the authorities.\r\n\r\nThis affliction has been observed in various countries. In Iceland it is\r\ncalled _Likraa_; in Norway, _Radesyge_ or _Spedalskhed_. It is to be\r\napprehended that many of these cases of leprosy belong more particularly\r\nto the elephantiasis: such is the red disease of Cayenne, and the _Boasi_\r\nof Surinam.\r\n\r\nIt is especially in the East, its probable original seat, that leprosy is\r\nobserved. In Damascus there are two hospitals for its treatment. The\r\nwaters of the Jordan are still considered efficacious in its cure, and the\r\nwaters of Abraham's well are looked upon as a specific. In Candia the\r\ndisease was common, and lepers were noted for their obscene profligacy.\r\nFrom Crimea it has also been carried to Astracan, whence it infected the\r\nCossacks of Jaick. Pallas and Gmelin have given an accurate account of its\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASPIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious opinions are entertained respecting the reptile that inflicted the\r\nfatal sting on Cleopatra. According to Pliny, it had hollow fangs, which\r\ndistilled the venom in the same manner as the tail of the scorpion. Aelian\r\nstates it to have been a snake that moves slowly, covered with scales of a\r\nreddish colour, his head crowned by callous protuberances, his neck\r\nbecoming swollen and inflated when he sheds his poisonous secretion. Other\r\nnaturalists affirm that the scales are shining, and the eyes of a dazzling\r\nbrightness; while some authorities maintain that the reptile's hue is of a\r\ndark brown colour, and that, like the chameleon, it can assume the colour\r\nof the ground on which it drags its writhing form. However, later\r\nobservers have now clearly ascertained that the aspic of the ancients is\r\nthe _coluber haje_, called by the Arabs _nascher_, and classed by Lacepede\r\nas the Egyptian viper. Lucan seems to have described this serpent in the\r\nfollowing lines:\r\n\r\n  Hic, quae prima caput movit de pulvere tabes\r\n  Aspida somniferum tumida cervice levarit.\r\n\r\nAccording to Hasselquist, the aspic's head is raised in a protuberance on\r\nboth sides behind the eyes; the scales which cover the back are small, of\r\na dirty white colour, and speckled with reddish spots. The lower surface\r\nof the reptile is striated with one hundred and eighteen small parallel\r\nzones, and forty-four smaller ones are under the tail. The teeth resemble\r\nin their structure those of other vipers; and, when the animal is\r\nirritated, its neck and throat are swelled up to the size of the body.\r\nAuthors vary in regard to its length. Hasselquist, from whom we have\r\nderived the above description, says that it is a short reptile; while\r\nSavary assures us that it sometimes measures six feet.\r\n\r\nThe ancients stated that the poison of the aspic did not occasion any\r\npain, but that the person it had stung gradually sunk into a calm and\r\nlanguid state, which was followed by a sound sleep, the forerunner of\r\ndissolution. Modern travellers assure us, on the contrary, that this venom\r\nis most active; and Hasselquist has observed an aspic in Cyprus, the bite\r\nof which brought on a rapid mortification, which generally proved fatal in\r\na very few hours.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt the viper is still made use of in medicinal preparations; and a\r\ngreat number of them are sent to Venice for the confection of the\r\ncelebrated _Theriaca_. Under Nero, we are told, that these reptiles were\r\nimported into Rome for pharmaceutical purposes.\r\n\r\nIn the above description, and endeavour to ascertain the nature of the\r\naspic of the ancients, there must be some error. The _coluber aspis_ of\r\nLinnaeus is not venomous, and we may therefore conclude that the aspic was\r\nof the same species as our viper. The venom of this animal is of a yellow\r\ntinge, and small in quantity, seldom exceeding two grains in weight. In\r\nhot weather it becomes more active in its effects. Time does not seem to\r\ndeprive it of its fatal properties; for instances have been known of\r\npersons having pricked their fingers with the pointed fangs of a viper\r\npreserved in spirits, when the most serious accidents have followed. The\r\ndried teeth lose this noxious power. The venom of the viper may be\r\nswallowed without any risk, provided there is not an ulcer in the mouth.\r\nFontana has made upwards of six thousand experiments to prove the activity\r\nof this substance. A sparrow died under its influence in five minutes, a\r\npigeon in eight or ten; a cat sometimes did not experience any\r\ninconvenience, a sheep seldom or never; and the horse appears to be proof\r\nagainst its action.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists have affirmed that the female viper, in cases of sudden\r\nalarm, possesses the faculty of securing the safety of her young by\r\nswallowing them and keeping them concealed in her stomach, as the kangaroo\r\nsecures her offspring in her pouch. This assertion, although fabulous, was\r\ncredited by Sir Thomas Brown, and since by Dr. Shaw. Stories equally\r\nabsurd have been circulated of this reptile. The Egyptians considered the\r\nviper as a typification of a bad wife, since they believed that during\r\ntheir union the female was in the habit of biting off her partner's head.\r\nThey also looked upon it as the emblem of undutiful children, from the\r\nidle belief that the viper came into the world by piercing an opening in\r\nits mother's side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELDEN'S COMPARISON BETWEEN A DIVINE, A STATESMAN, AND A PHYSICIAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a physician sees you eat any thing that is not good for the body, to\r\nkeep you from it he cries out \"It is _poison_!\" If the divine sees you do\r\nany thing that is hurtful to your soul, to keep you from it he cries out\r\n\"You are _damned_!\"\r\n\r\nTo preach long, loud, and damnation, is the way to be cried up. We love a\r\nman who damns us, and we run after him again to save us. If a man has a\r\nsore leg, and he should go to an honest and judicious surgeon, and he\r\nshould only bid him keep it warm, or anoint it with some well-known oil\r\nthat would do the cure, haply he would not much regard him, because he\r\nknows the medicine beforehand to be an ordinary medicine. But if he should\r\ngo to a surgeon that should tell him, \"Your leg will be gangrene within\r\nthree days, and it must be cut off; and you will die, unless you do\r\nsomething that I could tell you,\" what listening there would be to this\r\nman! \"Oh! for the Lord's sake, tell me what this is:--I will give you any\r\ncontents for your pains.\"\r\n\r\nThis ingenious antiquary has also made some quaint comparisons between\r\ndoctors of the body and doctors of the public interests. \"All might go on\r\nwell,\" he says, \"in the commonwealth, if every one in the parliament would\r\nlay down his own interest and aim at the general good. If a man was rich,\r\nand the whole college of physicians were sent to him to administer to him\r\nseverally; haply, so long as they observed the rules of art, he might\r\nrecover. But if one of them had a great deal of scammony by him, he must\r\nput off that; therefore will he prescribe scammony; another had a great\r\ndeal of rhubarb, and he must put off that; therefore he prescribes\r\nrhubarb: and they would certainly kill the man. We destroy the\r\ncommonwealth, while we preserve our own private interests and neglect the\r\npublic.\"\r\n\r\nGrotius called John Selden \"the honour of the English nation;\" and Bacon\r\nhad such an implicit faith in his judgment, that he desired in his will\r\nthat his advice should be taken respecting the publication or suppression\r\nof his posthumous works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LETTUCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious species of this plant were known to the ancients. Its type is\r\nsupposed to be the _Lactuca quercina_, or the _Lactuca scariola_; both of\r\nAsiatic origin. Many powerful effects were formerly attributed to its use.\r\nIt was considered as producing sleep, and recovery from intoxication; it\r\nwas in consequence of this belief that this salad was served up after\r\nmeals. Thus Martial tells us,\r\n\r\n  Claudere quae coenas Lactuca solebat avorum,\r\n  Die mihi cur nostras inchoat illa dapes.\r\n\r\nColumella thus describes its properties:\r\n\r\n  Jamque salutari properet Lactuca sapore\r\n  Tristia quae relevet longi fastidia mori.\r\n\r\nThis belief in its narcotic qualities induced the ancients to esteem it as\r\nan aphrodisiac: the Pythagoreans had therefore named it [Greek:\r\neunouchion]; and Eubulus calls it the food of the dead, _mortuorum cibum_.\r\nVenus covered the body of her beloved Adonis with lettuce-leaves to calm\r\nher amorous grief; and vases, in which they were planted, were introduced\r\nin the Adonian festivals. Galen, who had faith in its powers, called it\r\nthe herb of sages, and in his sleepless nights sought its influence by\r\neating it at supper. It was also frequently put under the pillow of the\r\nrich to lull them to repose. Its cooling qualities were so much dreaded by\r\nthe Roman gallants, that its use was abandoned; but Augustus's physician,\r\nAntonius Musa, having calmed by its prescription his master's uneasiness\r\nin a hypochondriac attack, lettuce recovered its popularity: a statue was\r\nerected to the doctor, and salad once more became the fashion, although\r\nthe prejudices against it could not be removed. Lobel informs us that an\r\nEnglish nobleman, who had long wished for an heir, but in vain, was\r\nblessed with a numerous family by leaving off this Malthusian vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL FEES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the perversity of our nature, that the remuneration given with the\r\ngreatest reluctance is the reward of those who restore us, or who\r\nconscientiously endeavour to restore us to health. The daily fees, it is\r\ntrue, are not handed with regret, for the patient is still suffering; but\r\nif they were to be allowed to accumulate to a considerable amount, they\r\nwould be parted with, with a lingering look. The lawyer's charges for a\r\nruinous litigation, the architect's demands for an uncomfortable house,\r\nare freely disbursed, though if exorbitant they may be taxed; but the\r\ndoctor's--a guinea a visit!--is sheer extortion. 'Send for the apothecary:\r\nthe physician merely gives me advice; the apothecary will send me plenty\r\nof physic: at any rate I shall have something for my money.'\r\n\r\nTo what can this unjust, this illiberal feeling be attributed? Simply to\r\nvanity and pride. Illness and death level all mankind. The haughty\r\nnobleman, who conceives himself contaminated by vulgar touch, can scarcely\r\nbring himself to believe that he is placed upon the same footing as a\r\nshoe-black. All _prestiges_ of grandeur and worldly pomp vanish round the\r\nbed of sickness; and the suffering peer would kneel before the humblest\r\npeasant for relief. Then it is that money would be cheerfully lavished to\r\nmitigate his sufferings. But how soon the scene is changed! The patient is\r\nwell, thrown once more in the busy vortex of business or of pleasure. He\r\nhad been slightly indisposed; his natural constitution is excellent: the\r\ndoctors mistook his case; thought him very ill, forsooth; but nature cured\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nCould the ambitious mother admit for one moment that her daughter had been\r\nseriously ill?--a sick wife is an expensive article! If her medical\r\nattendant unfortunately hinted that the young lady had been in danger, he\r\nis considered a busy old woman, exaggerating the most trifling ailment to\r\nobtain increase of business; in fact, a dangerous man in a family where\r\nthere are young persons--to be provided for. Nor can we marvel at this. No\r\none likes to be considered morally or physically weak, excepting\r\nhypochondriacs, who live upon groans, and feel offended if you tell them\r\nthat they do not look miserable. The soldier will describe the slightest\r\nwound he received in battle as most severe and dangerous; a feeling of\r\npride is associated with the relation. The bold hunter will boast of a\r\nfractured limb; the accident showed that he was a daring horseman. Nay,\r\nthe agonizing gout is a fashionable disease, which seems to proclaim good\r\nliving, good fellowship, and luxury: it is, in short, a gentlemanly\r\ndisease. But the slow ravages of hereditary ailments, transmitted from\r\ngeneration to generation with armorial bearings, the development of which\r\nmay be averted by proper care, or hurried on by fashionable imprudence!\r\nhow difficult even to hint to a family the presence of the scourge, when,\r\nthrough the transparent bloom of youth and beauty, our experienced eye\r\nreads the fierce characters of death in the prime of years. The aerial\r\ncoronet floats in fond visions before the doting mother's ambitious eyes.\r\nA man would be a barbarian, nay, a very brute, to deprive the darling girl\r\nof the chances of Almacks, the delights of the pestiferous ball-room, or\r\nthe galaxy of court or opera!\r\n\r\nTo attend the great is deemed the first stepping-stone to fortune, and\r\npatronage is considered as more than an equivalent of remuneration. Too\r\nfrequently does the physician placed in that desirable situation forget\r\nwhat Hippocrates said of the profession. \"The physician stands before his\r\npatient in the light of a demi-god, since life and death are in his\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nCurious anecdotes are related of this unbecoming subserviency. A courtly\r\ndoctor, when attending one of the princesses, was asked by George III. if\r\nhe did not think a little ice might benefit her. \"Your majesty is right,\"\r\nwas the reply; \"I shall order some forthwith.\" \"But perhaps it might be\r\ntoo cold,\" added the kind monarch. \"Perhaps your majesty is right again;\r\ntherefore her royal highness had better get it warmed.\"\r\n\r\nThis absurd deference to rank and etiquette by a physician who at the\r\nmoment is superior to all around him, reminds one of an account given by\r\nChampfort of a fashionable doctor. \"D'Alembert was spending the evening at\r\nMadame Du Deffand's, where were also President Henault and M. Pont de\r\nVesle. On this flexible physician's entering the room, he bowed to the\r\nlady with the formal salutation, '_Madame, je vous presente mes tres\r\nhumbles respects_.' Then, addressing M. Henault, '_J'ai bien l'honneur de\r\nvous saluer_.' Turning round to M. de Vesle he obsequiously said,\r\n'_Monsieur, je suis votre tres humble serviteur_;' and at last,\r\ncondescending to speak to D'Alembert, he nodded to him with a '_Bonjour,\r\nMonsieur_!'\" On such occasions a condescending smile from power is\r\nconsidered a fee.\r\n\r\nReluctance in remunerating medical attendants was also manifested by the\r\nancients; and Seneca has treated the subject at some length. The\r\ndifficulty in obtaining remuneration has unfortunately rendered many\r\nphysicians somewhat sordid, and loth to give an opinion unless paid for.\r\nIn this they are unquestionably right, as gratuitous advice is seldom\r\nheeded; and one of the most distinguished practitioners used to say, that\r\nhe considered a fee so necessary to give weight to an opinion, that, when\r\nhe looked at his own tongue in the glass, he slipped a guinea from one\r\npocket into another.\r\n\r\nTo consider themselves in proper hands, patients must incur expenses, and\r\nas much physic as possible be poured down. Malouin, physician to the Queen\r\nof France, was so fond of drugging, that it is told of him, that once\r\nhaving a most patient patient, who diligently and punctually swallowed all\r\nthe stuff he ordered, he was so delighted in seeing all the phials and\r\npill-boxes cleaned out, that he shook him cordially by the hand,\r\nexclaiming, \"My dear sir, it really affords me pleasure to attend you, and\r\nyou _deserve_ to be ill.\" Our apothecaries must surely meet with incessant\r\ndelight!\r\n\r\nThe most extraordinary remuneration was that received by Levett, Dr.\r\nJohnson's friend and frequent companion. It was observed of him that he\r\nwas the only man who ever became intoxicated from motives of prudence. His\r\npatients, knowing his irregular habits, used frequently to substitute a\r\nglass of spirits for a fee; and Levett reflected that if he did not accept\r\nthe gin or brandy offered to him, he could have been no gainer by their\r\ncure, as they most probably had nothing else to give him. Dr. Johnson says\r\n\"that this habit of taking a fee in whatever shape it was exhibited, could\r\nnot be put off by advice or admonition of any kind. He would swallow what\r\nhe did not like, nay, what he knew would injure him, rather than go home\r\nwith an idea that his skill had been exerted without recompence; and had\r\nhis patients,\" continues Johnson, \"maliciously combined to reward him with\r\nmeat and strong liquors, instead of money, he would either have burst,\r\nlike the dragon in the Apocrypha, through repletion, or been scorched up,\r\nlike Portia, by swallowing fire.\" But though this worthy was thus\r\nrapacious, he never demanded any thing from the poor, and was remarked for\r\nhis charitable conduct towards them.\r\n\r\nVarious professional persons have sometimes endeavoured to remunerate\r\ntheir medical attendants by reciprocal services: thus an opera-dancer\r\noffered to give lessons to a physician's daughters for their father's\r\nattendance upon him; and a dentist has been known to propose to take care\r\nof the jaws of a whole family to liquidate his wine bill. One of the\r\nwealthiest merchants of Bordeaux wanted to reduce the price of a\r\ndrawing-master's lessons, on the score of his taking his children's daubs\r\nwith him to sell them _on account_. This arrangement, however, did not\r\nsuit the indignant artist, who left the Croesus in disgust.\r\n\r\nA singular charge for medical attendance was lately brought before the\r\ncourt of requests of Calcutta, by a native practitioner. He demanded 314\r\nrupees for medicine alone, and in the items of drugs appeared pearls, gold\r\nleaf, and monkeys' navels!\r\n\r\nIn one of the old French farces there is an absurd scene between Harlequin\r\nand his physician. The motley hero had been cured, but refused to\r\nremunerate his Esculapius, who brought an action for his fees, when\r\nHarlequin declares to the judge that he would rather be sick again; and he\r\ntherefore offers to return his health to the doctor, provided he would\r\ngive him back his ailments, that each party might thus recover their own\r\nproperty. This incident was perhaps founded on an ancient opinion of\r\nHippocrates, who frequently mentioned salutary diseases. In 1729, a Dr.\r\nVillars supported a thesis on this subject, entitled \"_Dantur-ne morbi\r\nsalutares?_\" and Theodore Van Ween has also written a learned dissertation\r\non the same subject.\r\n\r\nA celebrated Dublin surgeon was once known to give a lesson of economy to\r\na wealthy and fashionable young man remarkably fond of his handsome face\r\nand person. He was sent for, and found the patient seated by a table,\r\nresting his cheek upon his hand, whilst before him was displayed a\r\nfive-pound note. After some little hesitation he removed his hand, and\r\ndisplayed a small mole on the cheek. \"Do you observe this mark,\r\ndoctor?\"--\"Yes, sir, I do.\"--\"I wish to have it removed.\"--\"Does it\r\ninconvenience you?\"--\"Not in the least.\"--\"Then why wish for its\r\nextirpation?\"--\"I do not like the look of it.\"--\"Sir,\" replied the\r\nsurgeon, \"I am not in the habit of being disturbed for such trifles;\r\nmoreover, I think that that little excrescence had better remain\r\nuntouched, since it gives you no uneasiness; and I make it a rule only to\r\ntake from my patients what is troublesome to them.\" So saying, he took the\r\nfive-pound note, slipped it into his pocket, and walked out of the room,\r\nleaving the patient in a state of perfect astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt is related of a physician who received his daily fee from a rich old\r\nmiser, who had it clenched in his fist when he arrived, and turned his\r\nhead away when he opened his hand for the doctor to take it, that, on\r\nbeing informed his patient had died in the morning, not in the least\r\ndisconcerted he walked up to the dead man's chamber, and found his\r\nclenched fist stretched out as usual; presuming that it still grasped the\r\naccustomed remuneration, with some difficulty he opened the fingers, took\r\nout the guinea, and departed.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptian physicians of old were paid by the state, but they were not\r\nprevented from accepting remuneration from individuals, and they were\r\nallowed to make demands for their attendance except on a foreign journey,\r\nand during military services.\r\n\r\nWhen we compare the value of money it appears probable that the fees of\r\nolden practitioners were more considerable than the remuneration of the\r\npresent day. Attendance upon royalty and the court seems also to have been\r\nmore profitable. Dr. Radcliffe says, that he received from King William\r\n200_l._ a year more than any other physician in ordinary--this monarch\r\nupon his appointment, gave him moreover, 500 guineas out of the privy\r\npurse for his attendance on the Earl of Portland, and the Earl of\r\nRochford. When the same physician went to Hanau to attend Lord Albemarle,\r\nhe received 1200_l._ from the king, with 400 guineas from his patient,\r\nbesides a valuable diamond ring.\r\n\r\nDr. Radcliffe's fortune must have been considerable, as appears from his\r\nlegacies, bequeathing 5000_l._ for the improvements of University\r\nCollege--4000_l._ for the building of a library at Oxford--and 500_l._\r\nyearly for the amelioration of the diet of St. Bartholomew's hospital.\r\nRadcliffe had not been a year in London when he received 20 guineas daily,\r\nand he mentions that his fee for a visit from Bloomsbury Square to Bow,\r\nwas five guineas.\r\n\r\nWe do not exactly know what was the exact honorarium of Doctors in former\r\ndays, yet Baldwin Hammey informs us that in 1644, Dr. Robert Wright who\r\nhad only been settled three years in London, was in the habit of receiving\r\na thousand broad pieces (22 shillings) in the course of the year.\r\n\r\nThe following is a curious account of a puritan's consultation with Dr.\r\nHammey.\r\n\r\n\"It was in the time of the civil wars when it pleased God to visit him\r\nwith a severe fit of sickness, or peripneumonia, which confined him a\r\ngreat while to his chamber, and to the more than ordinary care of his\r\ntender spouse. During this time he was disabled from practice; but the\r\nvery first time he dined in his parlour afterwards, a certain great man in\r\nhigh station came to consult him on an indisposition--(_ratione vagi sui\r\namoris_,) and he was one of the godly ones too of those times. After the\r\ndoctor had received him in his study, and modestly attended to his long\r\nreligious preface, with which he introduced his ignominious circumstances,\r\nand Dr. Hammey had assured him of his fidelity, and gave him hopes of\r\nsuccess in his affair, the generous soldier (for such he was) drew out of\r\nhis pocket a bag of gold and offered it all at a lump to his physician.\r\nDr. Hammey, surprised at so extraordinary a fee, modestly declined the\r\nacceptance of it; upon which the great man, dipping his hand into the bag\r\nhimself, grasped up as much of his coin as his fist could hold, and\r\ngenerously put it into the doctor's coat-pocket, and so took his leave.\r\nDr. Hammey, returned into his parlour to dinner, which had waited for him\r\nall that time, and smiling (whilst his lady was discomposed at his being\r\nabsent so long), emptied his pocket into her lap. This soon altered the\r\nfeatures of her countenance, who telling the money over, found it to be\r\nthirty-six broad pieces of gold: at which she being greatly surprised,\r\nconfessed to the doctor that surely this was the most providential fee he\r\never received; and declared to him that during the height of his severe\r\nillness, she had paid away (unknown to him) on a state levy towards a\r\npublic supply, the like sum in number and value of pieces of gold; lest\r\nunder the lowness of his spirits, it should have proved a matter of\r\nvexation, unequal to his strength at that time to bear; which being thus\r\nso remarkably reimbursed to him by Providence, it was the properest\r\njuncture she could lay hold on to let him into the truth of it.\" It has\r\nbeen supposed, that the sanctimonious sufferer was no other than Ireton,\r\nCromwell's son-in-law.\r\n\r\nDuring the imprisonment of Dr. Friend in the tower, Dr. Head attended his\r\npatients, and on his liberation he presented him with 5000_l._ the amount\r\nof the fees received on his account. Dr. Meade's practice averaged from\r\n5000_l._ to 6000_l._ per annum. It is somewhat strange, that this\r\ncelebrated physician whose evenings were generally spent in convivial\r\nmeetings at Batson's Coffee-house, used in the forenoon to receive\r\nconsulting apothecaries at a tavern near Covent-garden, prescribing for\r\nthe patients without seeing them at half-a-crown fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENTHUSIASM.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm, from its derivation, might in strictness be called a _fixity\r\nof idea in divinity_; but Locke has given a better definition of this\r\nmorbid state of our intellectual faculties in considering it as a heated\r\nstate of the imagination, \"_founded neither on reason nor divine\r\nrevelation, but arising from the conceits of a warmed or overweening\r\nbrain_.\" I shall not venture to take the field of controversy to support\r\nthis doctrine against that of some metaphysicians, who most probably would\r\nconsider this mental aberration as an original and natural judgment\r\ninspired by the Almighty, founded not on reason or reflection, but an\r\ninstinctive impulse of the powers of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe Hebrews named this impulse _Nabi_ [Hebrew], (plural _Nebiim_,) \"to\r\napproach or enter,\" on the surmise that the spirit pervaded the prophets,\r\nwho were called _Roeh_ [Hebrew], or _Seeing_, hence _Seers_.\r\n\r\nPlato divided enthusiasm into four classes. I. _The Poetical_, inspired by\r\nthe Muses. II. _The Mystic_, under the influence of Bacchus. III. _The\r\nProphetic_, a gift of Apollo; and IV. _The Enthusiasm of love_, a blessing\r\nfrom Venus Urania. This immortal philosopher was not the visionary\r\nspeculatist which some writers have represented him; his logic did not\r\nconsist of frivolous investigations, but embraced the more useful subject\r\nof correct definition and division, as he sought to reconcile practical\r\ndoctrines of morality with the mysticism of theology by the study of\r\nDivine attributes. Whatever some of the Eclectic philosophers might have\r\nasserted, Plato considered that our ideas were derived from external\r\nobjects, and never contemplated the extravagant doctrine of imbodying\r\nmetaphysical abstractions, or personifying intellectual ideas.\r\n\r\nTo this day, the attentive observer will find Plato's classification of\r\nenthusiasm to be correct. The ecstatic exaltation of religion and of love\r\nare not dissimilar; only the latter can be cured, the former seldom or\r\nnever admits of mitigation: the fantastic visions of the lover may be\r\ndispelled by infidelity in the object of his misplaced affection; the\r\nphantasies of fanaticism can only yield to an improbable state of\r\ninfidelity. Shaftesbury has justly observed, \"There is a melancholy which\r\naccompanies all enthusiasm, be it of love or religion; nothing can put a\r\nstop to the growing mischief of either, till the melancholy be removed,\r\nand the mind be at liberty to hear what can be said against the\r\nridiculousness of an extreme in either way.\"\r\n\r\nOur poet Rowe has beautifully pointed out the facility with which a noble\r\nand martial soul can free itself from love's ignoble trammels.\r\n\r\n                          Rouse to the combat,\r\n  And thou art sure to conquer; war shall restore thee:\r\n  The sound of arms shall wake thy martial ardour,\r\n  And cure this amorous sickness of thy soul,\r\n  Begot by sloth, and nurs'd by too much ease.\r\n  The idle God of Love supinely dreams\r\n  Amidst inglorious shades and purling streams;\r\n  In rosy fetters and fantastic chains\r\n  He binds deluded maids and simple swains;\r\n  With soft enjoyment woos them to forget\r\n  The hardy toils and labours of the great:\r\n  But if the warlike trumpet's loud alarms\r\n  To virtuous acts excite, and manly arms,\r\n  The coward Boy avows his abject fear,\r\n  On silken wings sublime he cuts the air,\r\n  Scar'd at the noble horse and thunder of the war.\r\n\r\nThe only trumpet that can arouse the religious enthusiast from his ascetic\r\nmeditations is the war-whoop that calls him to destroy all those who\r\nimpugn his doctrines in a battle-field, where each champion seeks\r\npre-eminence in cruelty, and rancorous persecution.\r\n\r\nWhen we contemplate the miseries that have arisen from fanaticism, or\r\nfervid enthusiasm, although it is but a sad consolation, yet it affords\r\nsome gratification in our charitable view of mankind, to think, nay to\r\nknow, that this fearful state of mind is a disease, a variety of madness,\r\nwhich may in many instances be referred to a primary physical\r\npredisposition, and a natural idiosyncrasy. It is as much a malady as\r\nmelancholy and hypochondriacism. In peculiar constitutions it grows\r\nimperceptibly. Lord Shaftesbury has made the following true observation:\r\n\"Men are wonderfully happy in a faculty of deceiving themselves whenever\r\nthey set heartily about it. A very small foundation of any passion will\r\nserve us not only to act it well, but even to work ourselves in it beyond\r\nour own reach; a man of tolerable goodnature, who happens to be a little\r\npiqued, may, by improving his resentment, become a very fury for revenge.\"\r\n\r\nThus it is with enthusiasm, a malady which in its dreadful progress has\r\nbeen known to become contagious, one might even say epidemic. Vain terrors\r\nhave seized whole populations in cities and in provinces; when every\r\naccident that happened to a neighbour was deemed a just punishment of his\r\nsins, and every calamity that befel the fanatic was considered the hostile\r\nact of others. Jealousy and dark revenge were the natural results of such\r\na state of mind, when the furious fire of bigotry was fanned by ambition\r\nuntil monomania became daemonomania of the most hideous nature, and every\r\nmaniac bore in his pale and emaciated visage the characteristic of that\r\ntemperament which predisposes to the disease. Seldom do we observe it in\r\nthe _sanguineous temperament_, remarkable for mental tranquillity, yet\r\ndetermined courage when roused to action. The _choleric_ and _bilious_,\r\nimpetuous, violent, ambitious, ever ready to carry their point by great\r\nvirtues or great crimes, may no doubt rush into a destructive career; but\r\nthen they lead to the onset the atrabilious, men saturated with black\r\nbile, and constituting the _melancholy temperament_. Here we behold the\r\ncountenance sallow and sad; the visage pale and emaciated, of an unearthly\r\nhue; gloom, suspicion, hate, depicted in every lineament; the mirror of a\r\nsoul unfitted for any kind sentiment of affection, pity, or forgiveness.\r\nDetesting mankind, and detested, they seek solitude, to brood upon their\r\nwretchedness, or to derive from it the means to make others as miserable\r\nas themselves. Such do we usually find the enthusiastic monomaniac. His\r\nideas are concentrated into a burning focus, which consumes him like an\r\nardent mirror. His life of relation is nearly extinguished. His external\r\nsenses are rendered so obtuse and callous that he becomes insensible to\r\nhunger and thirst, to heat and cold however intense; and bodily injuries,\r\nwhich would occasion excruciating agonies in others, he bears without any\r\napparent feeling. On this subject of religious enthusiasm the remarks of\r\nEvagrius are worthy of notice. \"Contrarieties,\" he says, \"are in\r\nthemselves so tempered, and the grace of God maketh in them such an union\r\nof discordant things, that life and death, which are in essence so\r\nopposite to each other, seem to join hands and dwell together in them.\r\nHappy are they while they live, and happier still when they depart.\" It\r\nhas been known amongst these rigid ascetics that when a stranger visited\r\nthem, they mortified themselves by entertaining him and partaking of the\r\ngood cheer. Thus inventing a novel kind of fasting--eating and drinking\r\nagainst their will.\r\n\r\nIt is related of St. Macarius, that one day having killed a gnat that had\r\nstung him, he was struck with such compunction at the sight of blood, that\r\nby way of atonement, he threw off his clothes, and remained in a state of\r\nnudity for six months in a marsh exposed to the bites of every noxious\r\ninsect. Sozomen in praising this mortification, assures us that this\r\nexposure to the inclemency of the weather, did so harden and tan him that\r\nhis beard could not make its way through the skin.\r\n\r\nIt has been erroneously supposed that such individuals, being hostile to\r\nmankind, are prone to do evil,--this is not generally the case; they seem\r\nsatisfied with their own sufferings, and only seek to inflict them upon\r\nothers when roused from their concentration by fanaticism.\r\n\r\nA late ingenious writer, in his work entitled \"The Natural History of\r\nEnthusiasm,\" has somewhat overdrawn the portrait of these unfortunate but\r\ndangerous beings when labouring under the disease, which he thus defines:\r\n\"It will be found that the elementary idea attached to the term in its\r\nmanifold applications, is that of fictitious fervour in religion, rendered\r\nturbulent, morose, or rancorous by junction with some one or more of the\r\nunsocial emotions; or, if a definition as brief as possible were demanded,\r\nwe should say that fanaticism is enthusiasm inflamed by hatred. Fanaticism\r\nsupposes three elements of belief: the supposition of malignity on the\r\npart of the object of our worship; a consequent detestation of mankind at\r\nlarge, as the subjects of malignant power; and then, a credulous conceit\r\nof the favour of Heaven shown to the few, in contempt of the rules of\r\nvirtue.\"\r\n\r\nShaftesbury had already said, that \"nothing besides ill-humour, either\r\nnatural or forced, can bring a man to think seriously that the world is\r\ngoverned by any devilish or malicious power.\" Such a fearful conviction\r\nconstitutes a clear case of daemonomania. Patients labouring under that\r\nmalady are ever prone to injure themselves and others, prompted, as they\r\nconstantly avow, by an evil spirit; but enthusiasts, who live in solitary\r\nmortification until a paroxysm of fanaticism draws them from their\r\nretreat, seldom or never meditate mischief to others, or indeed that\r\nhatred to mankind which our author considers a feature of their condition.\r\nSociety may become irksome, and may be shunned for ever, without a\r\nsentiment of hate. The gayest of the gay may be impelled by feelings more\r\nor less morbid to seek a voluntary endurance, to expiate real or imaginary\r\noffences, without experiencing a desire of a uselessly vindictive\r\nsentiment towards the former companions of their vices or follies.\r\nExtremes of depravity and contrition do not infrequently meet; and it has\r\nbeen remarked in Eastern countries, where asceticism arose, that the gates\r\nof the most splendid and luxurious cities open upon desert wilds or\r\nmountainous solitudes, to which the penitent may flee from his former\r\nscenes of ambition and enjoyment.\r\n\r\nSuch enthusiasts, excepting when enjoying the beatitude of ecstatic\r\nexaltation, are more to be pitied than feared. Persecution would most\r\nprobably drive them to a dangerous state of fanatic rage; and the noble\r\nphilosopher whom I have already quoted, very justly observes, \"They are\r\ncertainly ill physicians in the body politic who would needs be tampering\r\nwith these mental eruptions, and, under the specious pretence of healing\r\nthe itch of superstition, and saving souls from the contagion of\r\nenthusiasm, should set all nature in an uproar, and turn a few innocent\r\ncarbuncles into an inflammation and a mortal gangrene.\"\r\n\r\nEnthusiasts are supposed by their followers to be gifted with the faculty\r\nof prophecy; and it is somewhat strange that the ancients considered\r\ncertain temperaments as best fitted for this inspiration. The atrabilious\r\ntemperament took the lead; and this melancholy state was to be increased\r\nby abstinence, mortification, and more especially rigid continence. The\r\nlatter privation, indeed, was deemed indispensable for prophets; and the\r\nJewish Rabbins inform us that Moses abandoned his wife Zipporah the very\r\nmoment that he was prophetically inspired. A physical reason has been\r\nadduced to prove the necessity of a chaste life, which I here must be\r\nallowed to pass over; but upon the same principle, emasculation was\r\nconsidered as rendering man totally unfit for prophetic revelation, or\r\nindeed any holy inspiration; and we find in the first of Deuteronomy that\r\nsuch subjects were not admissible to the service of the Temple.\r\n\r\nJesaias, and some other Jewish writers, have affirmed that Daniel belonged\r\nto that class of beings; but it has been shown that the name of _Spado_,\r\nwhich he bore, merely gave him the high rank that eunuchs held at the\r\nAssyrian court. Potiphar bore the same title among the Pharaohs. Baruch\r\nSpinosa maintained that temperaments should vary according to the nature\r\nof the prophecy; thus, a gay prophet would predict victory and happiness,\r\na gloomy one misery and wars; peace and concord, if he is human;\r\ndestruction and merciless events, if he were sanguinary: and, in support\r\nof his doctrine, he quotes the passage in Kings, where Elisha, when\r\nbrought before Jehosophat, called for a minstrel ere he predicted that\r\nvictory should crown the arms of Judah.\r\n\r\nVarious artificial means have been resorted to at all periods to prepare\r\nthe intellects for inspirations, by creating a heated imagination. Pliny\r\ninforms us that, in his days, the root of the _Halicacabum_, supposed to\r\nbe a species of hyoscyamus, was chewed by soothsayers. Christopher\r\nD'Acosta relates that the Indians employ a kind of hemp called _Bangue_\r\nfor the same purpose: and in St. Domingo their supposed prophets masticate\r\na plant called _Cohaba_. The priestesses of Delphi were also in the habit\r\nof chewing laurel-leaves before they ascended the tripod, which it is\r\nstated was originally formed of a laurel-tree root with three branches.\r\nSophocles calls the Sibyls [Greek: daphnephagos], laurel-eaters; and thus\r\nTibullus,\r\n\r\n  Vera cano, sic usque sacras innoxia lauros\r\n  Vescar, et aeternum sit mihi virginitas.\r\n\r\nAuguries were drawn from the burning of the laurel-leaf. If it crackled\r\nand sparkled during combustion, the inference was favourable; the\r\nreverse, if it was consumed in silence. Propertius alludes to this belief:\r\n\r\n  Et tacet extincto laurus adusta foco.\r\n\r\nYet so far from possessing exhilarating qualities, laurel-leaves were\r\nsupposed to diminish the excitement produced by wine; and Martial affirms\r\nthat the Roman ladies made use of them to drink large potations with\r\nimpunity:\r\n\r\n  Foetere multo Myrtale solet vino;\r\n  Sed fallat ut nos, folia devorat lauri,\r\n  Merumque, cauta fronde, non aqua miscet.\r\n\r\nMay it not be inferred that the leaves given to the Pythia might have been\r\nthose of the _Lauro-cerasus_, the effects of which are similar to those of\r\nprussic acid, producing vertigo, dizziness, and various convulsive\r\nsymptoms? This tree was first observed by Belon, who discovered it in his\r\neastern voyages in 1546; but it might have been well known to the\r\nancients. We may thus account for the violent convulsions in which the\r\npriestesses of Apollo were thrown on these mystic occasions, and which\r\nwere said to arise from the gas over which they were seated. Although the\r\ntree from which the leaves were gathered grew near the temple, and was the\r\ncommon _Lauros nobilis_, yet the leaves of the _Lauro-cerasus_ might have\r\neasily been substituted on the occasion; since, always green and shining,\r\nthey are not very unlike each other, and the flowers of both trees are\r\npedunculate; and, no doubt, the priests well knew to what extent they\r\ncould carry the dose to serve their purposes; possibly the modern\r\npreparation of _noyau_ might have been a Pythian dram.\r\n\r\nThe effects of enthusiasm in rendering its victims insensible to all\r\nexternal agents is truly surprising, and cannot be better illustrated than\r\nby a relation of the horrors which the famous Convulsionists of Paris and\r\nother parts of France underwent, not only voluntarily, but at their most\r\nearnest prayer and solicitation.\r\n\r\nThis work of miracles, as it was called, was first performed by a priest\r\nof the name of Paris, in 1724, and strange to say, the aberration\r\ncontinued for upwards of twelve years. Paris having departed this life in\r\nthe odour of sanctity, (at least according to the conviction of the\r\nJansenists, who had opposed with no little violence the famous bull\r\n_Unigenitus_), the Appellants, for such they thought proper to denominate\r\ntheir sect, appealed to the remains of their beatified companion to\r\noperate miracles in support of their common cause. The Appellants were\r\nabsurdly persecuted, therefore miracles became manifestations easy to\r\nobtain. Having succeeded in finding credulous dupes, the next step was to\r\nwork their credulity into a useful state of enthusiasm. They therefore\r\nsummoned all the sick, lame, and halt of their sectarians to repair to the\r\ntomb of St. Paris for radical relief. Crowds were soon collected round his\r\nblessed sepulchre. It is now generally supposed that animal magnetism was\r\nresorted to in these curative operations, or rather religious ceremonies.\r\nHad not the means thus employed for the purpose been recorded and\r\nauthenticated by the most irrefragable authorities, the sceptic might long\r\npause before he would yield them credence.\r\n\r\nThe patient (a female) was stretched on the ground, and the stoutest men\r\nthat could be found were directed to trample with all their might and main\r\nupon her body; kicking the chest and stomach, and attempting to tread down\r\nthe ribs with their heels. So violent were these exertions, that it is\r\nrelated a hunchbacked girl was thus kicked and trampled into a goodly\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe next exercise was what they called the plank, and consisted in laying\r\na deal board upon the patient while extended on the back, and then getting\r\nas many athletic men as could stand upon it, to press the body down; and\r\nin this endeavour they seldom showed sufficient energy to satisfy the\r\nsupposed sufferer, who was constantly calling for more pressure.\r\n\r\nNext came the experiment of the pebble, a diminutive name they were\r\npleased to give to a paving-stone weighing two-and-twenty pounds, which\r\nwas discharged by the operator upon the patient's stomach and bosom, from\r\nas great a height as he could well raise the weighty body. This terrific\r\nblow was frequently inflicted upwards of a hundred times, and with such\r\nviolence, that the house, and the furniture of the room, vibrated under\r\nthe concussion, while the astonished bystanders were terrified by the\r\nhollow sound re-echoed by the enthusiast at every blow.\r\n\r\nCarre de Montgeron affirms that the _pebble_ was not found sufficiently\r\npowerful, and the operator was obliged in one case to procure an iron\r\nfire-dog (_chenet_), weighing about thirty pounds, which was discharged as\r\nviolently as possible on the pit of the patient's stomach at least a\r\nhundred times. This instrument having for the sake of curiosity been\r\nhurled against a wall, brought part of it down at the twenty-fifth blow.\r\nThe operator further states, that he had commenced according to the usual\r\npractice, by inflicting moderate blows, until he was induced by her\r\nlamentable entreaties to redouble his vigour, but all to no purpose; his\r\nstrength was unavailing and he was obliged to employ a more athletic\r\nsurgeon, who fell to work with such energy that he shook the whole house.\r\nThe convulsionist, who was of the gentle sex, would not allow sixty blows\r\nshe had received from her first doctor to be included in the calculation\r\nof the dose, but insisted upon having her whole hundred as prescribed. It\r\nfurther appears, that at each stroke the delighted enthusiast would\r\nexclaim in ecstacy, \"Oh, how nice!\" \"Oh, what good it does me!\" \"Oh, dear\r\nbrother, hit away--again--again!\" For be it known, these operators were\r\ncalled by the affectionate name of brothers, whose claims to fraternal\r\naffection were in the ratio of the weight of their kindness towards the\r\nsisterhood.\r\n\r\nOne of these young ladies, who was not easily satisfied, wanted to try her\r\nown skill, and jumped with impunity into the fire, an exploit which\r\nobtained her the glorious epithet of Sister Salamander. The names that\r\nthese amiable devotees gave to each other were somewhat curious. They all\r\nstrove to imitate the whining and wheedling of spoiled children, or petted\r\ninfants; one was called _L'Imbecile_, another _L'Aboyeuse_, a third _La\r\nNisette_, and they used to beg and cry for barley-sugar and cakes;\r\nbarley-sugar signified a stick big enough to fell an ox, and cakes meant\r\npaving-stones. The excesses of these maniacs were at last carried to so\r\nfearful an extent, and their religious ceremonies were so debased by\r\nobscenities that the police was obliged to interfere, and forbid these\r\ndetestable practices; hence it was affirmed that the following somewhat\r\nimpious notice was suspended over the church-door:\r\n\r\n  De par le Roi, defense a Dieu,\r\n  De faire miracle en ce lieu.\r\n\r\nThese lunatics, for such they must be considered, were not impostors. They\r\nhad been worked to this degraded state by the plastic power of\r\nsuperstition, and implicit reliance was placed in their assertions; for,\r\nas Pascal said, \"we must believe people who are ready to have their\r\nthroats cut.\" Whether the Jansenist priests belonged to the same class, I\r\nleave to the reader to decide.\r\n\r\nCabanis, in his interesting work, \"Rapports du Physique et du Moral de\r\nl'Homme,\" offers the following remarks on this most curious subject:\r\n\"Sensibility may be considered in the light of a fluid the quality of\r\nwhich is determined, and which, when carried to certain channels in\r\ngreater proportion than to others, must of course be diminished in the\r\nlatter ones. This is evident in all violent affections, but more\r\nespecially in those ecstasies where the brain and other sympathetic organs\r\nare possessed of the highest degree of energetic action, while the faculty\r\nof feeling and of motion--in short, the vital powers--seem to have fled\r\nfrom the other parts of the system. In this violent state, fanatics have\r\nreceived with impunity severe wounds, which, if inflicted in a healthy\r\ncondition, would have proved fatal or most dangerous; for the danger that\r\nresults from the violent action of external agents on our organs depends\r\non their sensibility, and we daily see poisons, which would be deleterious\r\nto a healthy man, innocuous in a state of illness. It was by availing\r\nthemselves of this physical disposition that impostors of every\r\ndescription, and of every country operated most of their miracles; and it\r\nwas by these means that the Convulsionists of St. Medard amazed weak\r\nimaginations with the blows they received from swords and hatchets, and\r\nwhich in their ascetic language they called _consolations_. This was the\r\nmagic wand with which Mesmer overcame habitual sufferings, by giving a\r\nfresh direction to the attention, and establishing in constitutions\r\npossessed of great mobility a sense of action to which they had been\r\nunaccustomed. It was thus also that the _Illuminati_ of France and Germany\r\nsucceeded in destroying external sensations amongst their adepts,\r\ndepriving them in fact of their relative existence.\"\r\n\r\nIn these phenomena we do not witness miracles or supernatural agency.\r\nEnthusiasts are simply maniacs. Like maniacs, their vital endowments are\r\nderanged; they lose the faculty of feeling, of reasoning, of comparing, of\r\nassociating their ideas; their volition, their memory have fled, and all\r\nthe functions of organic life are more or less disturbed. Rousseau never\r\nproved more clearly that his own intellectual faculties were occasionally\r\nimpaired, than when he stated \"that the state of reflection is unnatural,\r\nand that the man who meditates is a depraved animal.\"\r\n\r\nInsanity may be divided into four species:\r\n\r\n1st, _Monomania_, and _melancholy_, in which the delirium is confined to\r\none or few objects.\r\n\r\n2nd, _Mania_, where the delirium embraces a variety of impressions, and is\r\naccompanied with violence.\r\n\r\n3rd, _Dementia_, or insanity in the full acceptation of the word, where\r\nthe senses are totally bewildered, and the faculty of thinking destroyed.\r\n\r\n4th, _Imbecility_ or _idiotcy_, where, from imperfect organisation,\r\nratiocination cannot be correct.\r\n\r\nTo the first of these categories enthusiasts generally belong. Delirium,\r\nor wandering, is to a certain extent applicable to all, being a want of\r\ncorrespondence between judgment and perception. Locke and Condillac\r\ncharacterize madness as a _false judgment_, or a disposition to associate\r\nideas incorrectly, and to mistake them for truths. Hence it is observed by\r\nLocke that \"Madmen err, as men do that argue right from wrong principles.\"\r\nDr. Beattie refers madness to _false perception_; and Dr. Mason Good,\r\njustly remarks, that \"the perceptions in madness seem, for anything we\r\nknow to the contrary, to be frequently as correct as in health, the\r\njudgment or reasoning being alone diseased or defective.\"\r\n\r\nI hope that I may not be accused of _materialism_ when I venture to affirm\r\nthat all these enthusiasts labour under a physical disease; but whether\r\nthis state was originally brought on by a morbid condition of the\r\nintellectual or the empassioned faculties of the mind, or, in other words,\r\nwhether a diseased state of the mind brought on a diseased state of the\r\nbody, I shall not at present venture to decide, as the disquisition would\r\nbe foreign to the nature of this work, and lead us into investigations of\r\nlittle interest to the generality of readers.\r\n\r\nIn the German Psychological Magazine we meet with a curious case of a\r\npatient who believed that he was supernaturally endowed with the power of\r\nworking miracles. The man was a gend'arme of the name of Gragert, of a\r\nharmless and quiet disposition, but rather of a superstitious turn of\r\nmind. From poverty, family misfortunes, and severe military discipline, a\r\nseries of sleepless nights and a mental disquietude were brought on that,\r\naccording to his own report, nothing could dissipate but a perusal of\r\npious works. In reading the Bible he was struck with the book of Daniel,\r\nand was so much pleased with it, that it became his favourite study; from\r\nthat moment the idea of miracles so strongly possessed his imagination,\r\nthat he began to believe that he could perform some himself. He was\r\npersuaded more especially that if he were to plant an apple-tree with the\r\nview of its becoming a cherry-tree, such was his power that it would bear\r\ncherries. He was wont to answer every question correctly, except when the\r\nsubject concerned miracles, in regard to which he ever entertained his old\r\nnotions; adding, however, that he would relinquish this thought if he\r\ncould be convinced that the event of his trials did not correspond with\r\nhis expectations.\r\n\r\nThat many enthusiasts, although incurable in their peculiar aberration,\r\nhave possessed some amiable qualities, is undeniable. Such rare\r\noccurrences remind one of the curious case of madness recorded by Tidemann\r\nof a lunatic of the name of Moses, who was insane on one side, and who\r\nobserved his insanity with the other; his better half constantly rebuking\r\nhis worse half for its absurdities. This case was certainly typical of the\r\nmarried state.\r\n\r\nIn vain have physicians endeavoured to break through this morbid\r\ncatenation of incongruous ideas by diversions, or what the French call\r\n_distractions_, which in general answered to our literal translation of\r\nthe word, and _distracted_ their patients. Dramatic performances were once\r\nallowed in a mad-house near Paris; but the violence of the maniacs, the\r\nmoroseness of the melancholy, and the stupidity of the idiots, rendered\r\nthe exertions of the actors perilous to some, and idle to all. Mr.\r\nD'Esquirol once took one of his patients to a play, and the man swore that\r\nevery performer who came on was making love to his wife; and a young lady,\r\nplaced in a similar situation, exclaimed that all the people were going to\r\nfight about her. Jealousy and vanity were, no doubt, the ruling passions\r\nin both these cases. Travel has been recommended both by the ancients and\r\nthe moderns. Seneca on this subject quotes Socrates, who replied to a\r\nmelancholy wight who complained that his journeys had afforded him no\r\namusement, \"_I am not surprised at it, since you were travelling in your\r\nown company_.\"\r\n\r\nThe contagion of enthusiasm is a marvellous fact. Pausanias relates that\r\nthe malady of the daughters of Proetus, who ran about the country\r\nfancying that they were transformed into cows, was common amongst the\r\nwomen of Argos. Plutarch states that a disease reigned in Miletium, in\r\nwhich most of the young girls hung themselves; recent observations have\r\nconfirmed this singular circumstance. Dr. Deslages, of St. Maurice,\r\nrelates that a woman having hanged herself in a neighbouring village, most\r\nof her companions felt an invincible desire to follow her example.\r\nPrimrose and Bonet tell us that at one period it was found difficult to\r\nprevent the young girls in Lyons from casting themselves into the river.\r\nSimon Goulard has recorded the prevalent madness amongst the nuns of the\r\nStates of Saxony and Brandenburg, and which soon extended its influence to\r\nHolland, during which these religious ladies \"predicted, capered, climbed\r\nup walls, spoke various languages, bleated like sheep, and amused\r\nthemselves by biting each other.\" History has recorded the horrible\r\njudicial murder of Urbain Grandier, at Laudun, who was sacrificed for\r\nbedevilling a nunnery. The recent gift of tongues amongst the _Irvingites_\r\nis still in full vigour, and the _Southcotians_ are still on the look-out\r\nin London, as the _Sebastianists_ are in Lisbon.\r\n\r\nAddison has remarked that an enthusiast in religion is like an obstinate\r\nclown, and a superstitious man like an insipid courtier. On this subject\r\nhe quotes the following old heathen saying recorded by Aulus\r\nGellius--_Religentem esse oportet, religiosum nefas_; for, as the author\r\ntells us, Nigidius observed upon this passage, that the Latin words which\r\nterminate in _osus_ generally imply vicious characters, or the having any\r\nquality to excess. That we should enthusiastically admire all that is\r\nholy, sublime, or endowed with uncommon superiority in religion, in\r\npoetry, in the fine arts, is not only justifiable but praiseworthy. Genius\r\ncannot exist without a certain degree of fervour; its inspiration is a\r\ngift divine, naturally associated with a religious feeling. The man thus\r\ninspired must bend in humble admiration before the wondrous harmony that\r\nsurrounds him. The poet, the painter, the musician, can only seek\r\nexcellence by studying primitive perfection. Nothing that is not natural\r\ncan be truly sublime or beautiful. A rigid observation of nature can alone\r\nlead to superiority, and we can only be taught to create by, endeavouring\r\nto imitate the beauties of the creation. How distant are these generous\r\nfeelings from the low grovelling prejudices of bigotry! We admire\r\nperfection even in our enemies; and Erasmus was not a truant to his faith\r\nwhen, transported with Socrates's dying speech, he exclaimed, \"O Socrates!\r\nI can scarce forbear kneeling down to thee, and praying,\r\n\r\n  _Sancte Socrates, ora pro nobis_.\"\r\n\r\nWhile considering this interesting subject, a curious question arises: is\r\nenthusiasm more frequently excited by truth than by error? I sadly fear\r\nthat the latter influence will in general be found to predominate,\r\nalthough falsehood then assumes the deceptive garb of veracity. The noble\r\nwriter whom I have already cited,[19] has justly said, \"that truth is the\r\nmost powerful thing in the world, since even fiction itself must be\r\ngoverned by it, and can only please by its resemblance.\"\r\n\r\nTo what then are we to attribute this power that fallacy possesses of\r\ninspiring the mind with visionary hopes and fears? Simply because we cease\r\nto reason upon matter of fact, and soar in fanciful regions in search of a\r\nflittering phantom, a creature of our own imaginative faculties. What\r\nfalls every day under our personal observation ceases to amaze, and one\r\nmight even become familiarized to miracles were they of frequent\r\noccurrence. Man is naturally disposed to admire what he cannot understand,\r\nand to venerate what is incomprehensible. The nature of the divinity being\r\nessentially incomprehensible, a religious character is attached to all\r\nother subjects that are equally beyond the limits of our understanding.\r\nSir Thomas Brown has said, \"Methinks there be not impossibilities enough\r\nin religion for an active faith. I love to lose myself in a mystery, to\r\npursue my reason to an _O altitudo_! I can answer all the objections of\r\nSatan and my rebellious reason, with that odd resolution I learned from\r\nTertullian, _Certum est quia impossibile est_.\" From our earliest infancy\r\nwe are delighted with fictions, which we verily fancy to be relations of\r\ntrue facts, and whether we believe with the ancients in the metamorphoses\r\nof heathen mythology, the absurd papal stories of the miracles of their\r\nsaints, or the wondrous incidents of a fairy tale, we listen to these\r\nrhapsodies with avidity; whether Jupiter is turned into a shower of gold,\r\nSt. Denis and St. Livarius travel with their heads under their arm, or Tom\r\nThumb pulls on his seven-league boots. These absurdities are our day\r\nthoughts, our night dreams--nay, busy fancy does so dwell on these\r\nenchanting phantasies, that, in some cases, the intellectual faculties\r\nbecome deranged, and I have at present under my care, a female who lost\r\nher reason by constantly reading the Arabian Nights, and who in her\r\nhallucinations, describes as many marvellous voyages as could have done\r\nthe sailor Sinbad.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of incredulity no doubt is ignorance, but too often we find\r\nmen of refined education and feeling the most easily imposed upon by\r\nincredible assertions; we seldom experience as much enthusiasm in the\r\npossession of any object as in the pursuit, more especially if that\r\npursuit be vain. The merchant who has realized a splendid fortune in his\r\ncommercial ventures, is satiated with his business, and becomes careless\r\nin the pursuit of greater riches, but let him for one moment contemplate\r\nthe possibility of discovering the philosopher's stone, he will lose, and\r\ncheerfully too, all his past earnings in the chimerical pursuit, and the\r\nman who would doze over his ledger, will spend his sleepless nights\r\ncontemplating his crucibles, and studying the black art.\r\n\r\nWhat is there of an exciting nature in the common events of life and the\r\nusual course and uniformity of nature? Very little. However wondrous the\r\nworks of the creation may be, habit has so accustomed us to behold them,\r\nthat they are familiar to our eyes; they become matter of fact, and\r\nscience has taught us to comprehend the nature of many phenomena, which\r\nmight otherwise have appeared incredible: but when we seek for an\r\nunattainable object, however fallacious its attraction may be, the mind is\r\nroused to energetic action: if we strive to excel all others in the fine\r\narts, in poetical productions, we become fired with an exalted zeal, which\r\nage and experience alone can temper. In our vain pursuit of ideal\r\nperfection, the mind may be compared to a focus in which our burning\r\nthoughts are concentrated, until we are consumed by disappointment: the\r\nlove of Pygmalion was probably the most ardent passion that could fire the\r\nbreast of man. Enthusiasm laughs to scorn the suggestion of the senses and\r\ncommon understanding, therefore all its priests and votaries are\r\nsurrounded with a deceptive halo; and Plotinus maintained that a proper\r\nworship of the gods consisted in a mysterious self annihilation and a\r\ntotal extinction of every faculty. The same may be said of love, which,\r\nlike all other enthusiastic passions, may be considered a temporary\r\nhallucination.\r\n\r\nMoreover the language of fiction is not required to maintain the\r\nself-evident testimonies of facts.\r\n\r\n            As true as truth's simplicity,\r\n  And simpler than the infancy of truth.\r\n\r\nWhereas false doctrines and fallacious opinions need all the aid of\r\nimagination's vivid colours to disguise their real form with a goodly\r\noutside. We may in general conclude that enthusiasts are at first deceived\r\nthemselves to become in turn deceivers. Seldom does man display sufficient\r\nhumility to admit that he has erred in his favourite doctrines, and how\r\nmuch less will he be disposed to confess his deviation from rectitude,\r\nwhen imposture becomes the source of wealth and power, and hypocrisy a\r\ntrade: to the ghostly speculator we may well apply the lines of Massinger:\r\n\r\n  Oh, now your hearts make ladders of your eyes,\r\n  In show to climb to heaven, where your devotion\r\n  Walks upon crutches.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, fortunate that errors generally assist the development of\r\ntruth. The progress of the Christian faith was materially forwarded by the\r\nabsurdities and fallacies of all other religions; and Helvetius has truly\r\nobserved that if we could for a moment doubt the truth of Christianity,\r\nits divine origin would be proved by its having survived the horrors of\r\npopery. False theories led Columbus to correct geographic conclusions, and\r\nGalileo's discoveries overthrew his own former theories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINAL EFFECTS OF WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the various means resorted to by quackery to speculate upon the\r\ncredulity of mankind, simple river or spring water, coloured and flavoured\r\nwith inert substances, has not been the least productive; and many a time\r\nthe Thames and Seine have been fertile sources of supposed invaluable\r\nmedicines. Sangrado's doctrines on aqueous potations have long prevailed\r\nin the profession; and it has been stoutly maintained that a water diet\r\ncan cure the gout and various other diseases. That relief, if not cures,\r\nhave been obtained by this practice, there cannot be the least doubt. Are\r\nwe to attribute these favourable results to the effects of the\r\nimagination, the beneficial efforts of nature, or the salutary abstinence\r\nwhich this prescription imposed? Possibly they all combined to assist the\r\nphysician's efforts, or rather aid his effete treatment. Cold water and\r\nwarm water have in turn been praised to the very skies by their eulogists,\r\nand become the subject of ridicule and persecution on the part of more\r\nspirited practitioners.\r\n\r\nIn surgery, water has ever been considered of great utility; it, no doubt,\r\nwas instinctively used by man to cleanse and heal his wounds. Patroclus,\r\nhaving extracted the dart from his friend Eurypylus, washes the wound; and\r\nthe prophet Elisha prescribes to Naaman the waters of Jordan. Rivers had\r\nvarious qualities, and were supposed to prove as different in their action\r\non the economy as the mineral springs which from time immemorial, have\r\nbeen resorted to. These effects may in fact not be altogether doubtful;\r\nfor, although these salutary streams may not possess sufficient active\r\ningredients to be recognised by chemical tests, yet we know that\r\nsubstances which appear perfectly inert may prove highly active and\r\neffectual when combined and diluted naturally or artificially. Moreover,\r\nin the effects of watering-places on the invalid or valetudinarian, we\r\nmust not forget the powerful influence of change of air and habit, the\r\ninvigorating stimulus of hope, and the diversion from former occupations.\r\nTo these auxiliaries many a remedy has owed its high reputation; and\r\nprobably when Wesley attributed his recovery to brimstone and\r\nsupplication, he in a great measure might have considered rest from\r\nincessant labour the chief agent in his relief. The exhilarating effects\r\nof the picturesque site of many of these salutary places of resort is\r\nuniversally acknowledged. Montaigne, Voltaire, Alfieri, acknowledged their\r\ninfluence on the imagination. Petrarch's inspirations flowed with the\r\nwaters of Vaucluse, some of Sevigne's most delightful letters were written\r\nat Vichy, and Genlis and Stael were particularly happy in their epistolary\r\nelegance at Spa and Baden.\r\n\r\nWe owe to accident many valuable discoveries in medicine. It is said that\r\nseveral Indians, having used the waters of a lake in which a cinchona tree\r\nwas growing, experienced the benefit which led to the use of the Peruvian\r\nbark; and the thermal properties of the baths of Carlsbad were first made\r\nknown by the howling of one of Charles the Fourth's hounds, that had\r\nfallen in them in a hunt. It has been also observed, in various countries,\r\nthat particular waters produced various morbid affections; and to this\r\ncause have been attributed goitres, cretinism, calculi, and other\r\ndistressing diseases. The ancients dreaded the impurity of their rivers.\r\nThe Romans boiled their water in extensive _thermopolia_, where not only\r\npotations were drunk hot, but occasionally refrigerated with ice and snow,\r\nand, when thus prepared, called _decocta_. Juvenal and Martial refer this\r\ncustom to the Greeks. Herodotus informs us that the Persian monarchs were\r\naccompanied on their expeditions by chariots laden with silver vases\r\nfilled with the water of the _Choaspes_ that had been boiled, and which\r\nwas solely destined for the king's use: Athenaeus tells us that it was\r\nlight and sweet. Many ancient coins and inscriptions have recorded these\r\nsalutary properties of certain waters.\r\n\r\nThis real or supposed efficacy was scarcely discovered before it became\r\nthe domain of priests: and common rain or river water became valuable and\r\nsanctified when blessed by them: hence the introduction of lustral water.\r\nThe fluid extracted from the gown of Mahomet is the sacred property of the\r\nsultan. The moment the fast of the Ramazan is proclaimed, this holy\r\nvestment is drawn from a gold chest, and, after having been kissed with\r\ndue devotion, plunged in a vase of happy water, which, when wrung from the\r\ngarment, is carefully preserved in precious bottles, that are sent by the\r\nmonarch as valuable presents, or sold at exorbitant prices as cures for\r\nany and every disease. Thus were the good effects of ablution, especially\r\nin wounds, attributed to some secret charm or quality conferred upon it by\r\nclerical benediction or the legitimacy of princes. When a quack of the\r\nname of Doublet cured the wounded at the siege of Metz in 1553, the water\r\nhe used was considered to have been of a mystic nature; and Brantome\r\ndescribes his treatment in the following words: \"Durant le susdit et tant\r\nmemorable siege, etait en la place un chirurgien nomme Doublet, lequel\r\nfaisait d'estranges cures avec du simple linge blanc, et belle eau claire\r\nvenant de la fontaine ou du puit; mais il s'aidait de sortileges et\r\nparoles charmees, et chacun allait a luy.\" This Doublet, no doubt, was\r\nacquainted with an ingenious treatise on gun-shot wounds, written by\r\nBlondi in 1542, in which he strongly recommended the use of cold water;\r\nbut, as his recommendation was not founded on any miraculous quality, he\r\nwas forgotten, while Doublet was considered a supernatural being. Previous\r\nto this simple and sagacious method of healing wounds, various curious\r\napplications were in high repute; more especially the oil of kittens,\r\nwhich the celebrated Pare discovered to his great delight, was prepared by\r\nboiling live cats, coat and all, in olive oil, and was until then a\r\nvaluable secret preparation, called _oleum catellorum_, and its use, with\r\nthat of other nostrums, was known under the name of _secret\r\ndressing_.[20]\r\n\r\nThis simple mode of dressing wounds, especially those that were inflicted\r\nby fire-arms, was a great desideratum; for, up to this era in surgery,\r\nthese injuries were healed by the application of scalding oil or red-hot\r\ninstruments, under the impression that they were of a poisonous nature.\r\nPare was one of the first army-surgeons who exploded this barbarous\r\npractice. Having, according to his own account, expended all his boiling\r\noil, he employed a mixture of yolk of egg, oil, and turpentine, not\r\nwithout the apprehension of finding his patients labouring under all the\r\neffects of poison the following day; when, to his great surprise, he found\r\nthem much more relieved than those to whom the actual cautery had been\r\napplied. In more recent times, armies have been unjustly accused of making\r\nuse of poisonous balls; and this absurd charge was brought against the\r\nFrench after the battle of Fontenoy, when the hospital fever broke out\r\namong the wounded crowded in the neighbouring villages. Chewing bullets\r\nwas also considered a means of imparting to them a venomous quality. Lead\r\nand iron, the metals of which these projectiles were usually cast, were\r\nalso deemed of a poisonous nature. A sort of aristocratic feeling seemed\r\nto obtain in those days; and it is related that two Spanish gentlemen had\r\nprocured gold balls to fire at Francis I. at the battle of Pavia, that so\r\nnoble and generous a prince should not fall by the vile metal reserved for\r\nvulgar people; and, in the adverse ranks, La Chatarguene, a noble of the\r\nFrench court, had prepared bullets of the same costly material for the\r\nreception of Charles V. It was under the impression of this poisonous\r\nnature of wounds, that individuals of both sexes, called suckers, followed\r\narmies, and endeavoured to extract the venom by suction; the records of\r\nchivalry give us instances of lovely damsels who condescended to perform\r\nthis operation with their lovely mouths upon their _damoiseaux_; and\r\nSibille submitted the wounds of her husband, Duke Robert, to a similar\r\ntreatment: indeed, these suckers were chiefly females. May not this\r\npractice be the origin of the term _leech_, applied in ancient times to\r\nmedical men? Leechcraft was the art of healing. Thus Spenser:\r\n\r\n            And then the learned leech\r\n  His cunning hand 'gan to his wounds to lay,\r\n  And all things else the which his art did teach.\r\n\r\nTo this day, the custom of sucking wounds prevails among soldiers; and\r\nthere is every reason to hope, from the experiments of the late Sir David\r\nBarry, that the exhaustion produced by cupping-glasses will be found of\r\nessential service in all venomous wounds. This practice of suction, no\r\ndoubt, was known in Greece; Machaon performed it at the siege of Troy. The\r\nmothers and wives of the ancient Germans had recourse to the same process.\r\nIn India the suction of wounds constitutes a profession. It was by this\r\nmeans that the Psylli cured the bite of serpents; and it is related of\r\nCato, that his abhorrence of the Greek surgeons was such, that he directed\r\nPsylli to follow the Roman armies.\r\n\r\nWater affords a beautiful illustration of that indestructibility with\r\nwhich the Creator invested matter for the preservation of the world he\r\nformed from elementary masses, and appears to have existed unchangeable\r\nfrom the commencement of the universe. Its constituent parts are not\r\nbroken into by any atmospheric revolution; they continue the same, whether\r\nin the solid ice, the fluid state of a liquid, or the gaseous form of a\r\nvapour. Its powers are undiminished, whether in the wave or the steam; the\r\nmost effective agent in the hands of man to promote that welfare and\r\nhappiness which his own errors deprive him of, frequently bringing on\r\nthose calamities that his perversity attributes to the will of the\r\nOmnipotent. Water is the same in the atmosphere as on the earth, and falls\r\nin the very same nature as it ascends; electricity has no other influence\r\nupon it than that of hastening its precipitation. Chemical agents, however\r\npowerful, can only decompose its elementary principles upon the most\r\nlimited scale. The heterogeneous substances with which water may\r\noccasionally be alloyed must be considered as purely accidental.\r\n\r\nThe homogeneous characters of this fluid admit of no alteration, and, like\r\natmospheric air, are still obtained as pure most probably as when they\r\nfirst emerged from chaotic matter. The same principles are found in the\r\nclouds, the fogs, the dews, the rain, the hail, and the snow. For the\r\npreservation of the world it was indispensable that water should be\r\nendowed with the property of ever retaining its fluid form, and in this\r\nrespect become subject to a law different from that of other bodies, which\r\nchange from fluid to solid. This is a deviation from a general decree of\r\nNature. Were it not for this wise provision of the Creator, the world\r\nwould shortly have been converted into a frozen chaos. All bodies contract\r\ntheir dimensions, and acquire a greater specific gravity by cooling; but\r\nwater is excepted from this law, and becomes of less specific gravity,\r\nwhether it be heated, or cooled below 42 deg. 5'. Were it not for this\r\nexemption, it would have become specifically heavier by the loss of its\r\ncaloric, and the waters that float on the surface of rivers would have\r\nsunk as it froze, until the beds of rivers would have been filled up with\r\nimmense masses of ice. From the observations of Perron, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the mountainous accumulations of ice that have hitherto\r\narrested the progress of polar navigators have been detached from the\r\ndepths of the ocean to float upon its surface. This circumstance would\r\naccount for the difference of temperature of the sea according to its\r\ndepth. The experiments of Perron, made with an instrument of his own\r\ninvention, which he called the thermobarometer, gave the following\r\nresults:\r\n\r\n1st, The temperature of the sea upon its surface, and at a distance from\r\nshore, is at the meridian, lower than that of the atmosphere in the shade;\r\nmuch more elevated at midnight, but in a state of equilibrium morning and\r\nevening.\r\n\r\n2nd, The temperature rises as we approach continents or extensive islands.\r\n\r\n3rd, At a distance from land, the temperature of the deep parts of the sea\r\nis lower than that of the surface, and the cold increases with the depth.\r\nIt is this circumstance which led this ingenious philosopher to conclude\r\nthat even under the equator the bottom of the sea is eternally frozen.\r\n\r\nHumboldt is of a contrary opinion, and maintains that the temperature is\r\nfrom two to three degrees lower in shallow water; and he therefore is of\r\nopinion that the thermometer might prove of material use to navigators. He\r\nattributes this diminution of temperature to the admixture of the lower\r\nbodies of water with that of the surface. Who is to decide between these\r\ntwo ingenious experimentalists? \"Experientia fallax, judicium difficile.\"\r\nThe curious reader may consult in this investigation the tables of Forster\r\nin Cook's second voyage, those of Lord Mulgrave when Captain Phipps, and\r\nvarious other navigators.\r\n\r\nThe salutary medicinal effects of sea-bathing are generally acknowledged,\r\nalthough too frequently recommended in cases which do not warrant the\r\npractice; in such circumstances they often prove highly prejudicial. The\r\nancients held sea-water baths in such estimation, that Lampridius and\r\nSuetonius inform us that Nero had it conveyed to his palace. As\r\nsea-bathing is not always within the reach of those who may require it,\r\nartificial sea-water has been considered a desirable substitute; and the\r\nfollowing mode of preparing it, not being generally known, may prove of\r\nsome utility. To fifty pounds of water add ten ounces of muriate of soda,\r\nten drachms of muriate of magnesia, two ounces of muriate of lime, six\r\ndrachms of sulphate of soda, and the same quantity of sulphate of\r\nmagnesia. This is Swediaur's receipt. Bouillon Lagrange, and Vogel,\r\nrecommend the suppression of the muriate of lime and sulphate of soda, to\r\nbe replaced with carbonate of lime and magnesia; but this alteration does\r\nnot appear necessary, or founded on sufficient chemical grounds for\r\nadoption.\r\n\r\nSea-water taken internally has been considered beneficial in several\r\nmaladies; and, although not potable in civilized countries, it is freely\r\ndrunk by various savage tribes. Cook informs us that it is used with\r\nimpunity in Easter Island; and Schouten observed several fishermen in the\r\nSouth Sea drinking it, and giving it to their children, when their stock\r\nof fresh water was expended. Amongst the various and capricious\r\nexperiments of Peter the Great, an edict is recorded ordering his sailors\r\nto give salt water to their male children, with a view of accustoming them\r\nto a beverage which might preclude the necessity of laying in large stocks\r\nof fresh water on board his ships! The result was obvious: this nursery of\r\nseamen perished in the experiment. Russel, Lind, Buchan, and various other\r\nmedical writers, have recommended the internal use of sea-water in\r\nscrofulous and cutaneous affections; but its use in the present day is\r\npretty nearly exploded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVERBS AND SAYINGS REGARDING HEALTH AND DISEASE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ague in the spring is physic for a king.\r\n\r\nAgues come on horseback, but go away on foot.\r\n\r\nA bit in the morning is better than nothing all day.\r\n\r\nYou eat and eat, but you do not drink to fill you.\r\n\r\nAn apple, an egg, and a nut, you may eat after a slut.\r\n\r\n_Poma, ova, atque nuces, si det tibi sordida, gustes._\r\n\r\nOld young and old long.\r\n\r\nThey who would be young when they are old, must be old when they are\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n  When the fern is as high as a spoon,\r\n  You may sleep an hour at noon.\r\n  When the fern is as high as a ladle,\r\n  You may sleep as long as you are able.\r\n  When fern begins to look red,\r\n  Then milk is good with brown bread.\r\n\r\nAt forty a man is either a fool or a physician.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner sit a while, after supper walk a mile.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner sleep a while, after supper go to bed.\r\n\r\nA good surgeon must have an eagle's eye, a lion's heart, and a lady's\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nGood kale is half a meal.\r\n\r\nIf you would live for ever you must wash milk from your liver.\r\n\r\n_Vin sur lait, c'est souhait;

We therefore observe it after a\r\nheavy supper, or the use of any article of food of difficult digestion. It\r\nis to these circumstances more than to the \"unusual loss of volition,\"\r\nwhich some physiologists consider as its cause, that we are to attribute\r\nthis unpleasant perturbation of our repose, which impresses the sleeper\r\nwith the idea of some living being pressing upon the chest, inspiring\r\nterror, impeding respiration, and subduing all voluntary action that might\r\nendeavour to remove the unwelcome visiter. It has been observed that\r\npersons of a melancholy and contemplative disposition are more subject to\r\nit than the gay and the vivacious. Sedentary employment and anxiety of\r\nmind often bring it on; and it has been noticed in _nostalgia_, or regret\r\nof home, in soldiers and sailors. The sense of apprehension remains after\r\nthe sufferer is awakened, and the fluttering of the heart and quick pulse\r\nare observed for some time after, while drops of cold perspiration\r\nfrequently trickle down his brow. When the night-mare is the result of too\r\nmuch repletion, it is possible that its symptoms denote a pressure of the\r\nloaded stomach on the solar plexus.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the _night-mare_ derives its name from _Mara_, an evil\r\nspirit of the Scandinavians, which, according to the Runic theology,\r\nseized men in their sleep, and deprived them of the powers of volition.\r\nOur old Anglo-Saxon name for the disease was _Elf-Sidenne_, or\r\nelf-squatting; hence the popular term \"hag-ridden.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the malady which makes its attack by day, and when\r\nwaking: it has been called the day-mare, or _ephialtes vigilantium_. This\r\naffection, although uncommon, has been noticed by Forestus, Rhodius,\r\nSauvages, and Good. Forestus has known it to return periodically like an\r\nintermittent fever.\r\n\r\nIt is not always that the patient experiences unpleasant sensations in\r\nthese nocturnal attacks, which were not unfrequently of a curious nature.\r\nThe ancients thought that these intruders were sometimes sportive Fauns;\r\nhence Pliny calls the affection _ludibria Fauni_. At a subsequent period,\r\nsuperstition replaced the Fauns by _Incubi_, or evil spirits, who visited\r\nthe earth to destroy virtuous women; and it was once gravely discussed by\r\nthe Sorbonne, whether the offspring of such an union should be considered\r\nhuman, or the fair lady's reputation injured by the involuntary act of\r\ngiving a young incubus to the world. The absurd stories of the pranks of\r\nthe _Succubi_ and _Incubi_ are well known.\r\n\r\nEphialtes has been known to be epidemic, and has attacked numbers at a\r\ntime. Caelius Aurelianus informs us that Silimachus, a disciple of\r\nHippocrates, observed the phenomenon in Rome, when the disease generally\r\nproved fatal. It is more than probable that in these cases the night-mare\r\nwas merely symptomatic of other complaints. A French physician, Dr.\r\nLaurent, however, has related a very curious instance of a species of\r\nnight-mare attacking an entire regiment; he thus relates the singular\r\noccurrence:\r\n\r\n\"The first battalion of the regiment Latour d'Auvergne, of which I was the\r\nsurgeon, was garrisoned at Palmi, in Calabria, when we received a sudden\r\norder at midnight to march with all possible speed to Tropea; a flotilla\r\nof the enemy having appeared off the coast. It was in the month of June;\r\nwe had a march of forty miles of the country, and only arrived at our\r\ndestination at seven o'clock the following evening, having scarcely halted\r\nduring those thirty-one hours, and suffered considerably from the heat of\r\nthe sun. On our arrival the men found their rations cooked and their\r\nquarters prepared; but, having arrived the last, our regiment had the\r\nworst accommodation, and eight hundred men were pent up in a building\r\nscarcely capacious enough for half the number. The soldiers were in\r\nconsequence much crowded, and slept upon the straw without any bedding,\r\nand most uncomfortably. The building was an abandoned monastery; and the\r\ninhabitants warned us that we should not be able to occupy it quietly, as\r\nit was haunted every night. We laughed at their superstitious fears, but\r\nwere much amazed when, towards midnight, we heard loud cries, and the\r\nsoldiers rushed tumultuously, and in evident terror, out of their rooms.\r\nBeing interrogated as to the causes of this alarm, they all affirmed that\r\nthe devil was in the abbey; that they had seen him enter in the shape of a\r\nlarge black dog, that had jumped upon their breasts and disappeared. To\r\nconvince them of the absurdity of their fears was of no avail; not a\r\nsingle man could be persuaded to return to his quarters, and they\r\nwandered about the town until daybreak. On the following morning I\r\nquestioned the most steady non-commissioned officers and the oldest\r\nsoldiers; and though under ordinary circumstances they were strangers to\r\nfear, and never gave credit to any tales of supernatural agency, they\r\nassured me that the dog had weighed them down and nearly suffocated them.\r\nWe remained that day in Tropea, and had no other quarters to occupy but\r\nthe same monastery, and the soldiers would only take up their residence on\r\nthe condition that we should remain with them: the men retired to\r\nsleep--we watched; all was quiet until about one in the morning; when they\r\nawoke in the same terror, and fled from the building in dismay. We had\r\nlooked out most attentively, but could not perceive the cause of this\r\ncommotion. The following day we returned to Palmi; and, although we\r\nmarched over a great part of Italy, and were frequently equally crowded\r\nand uncomfortable, a similar scene never recurred.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Laurent very judiciously attributes this singular attack to the\r\npernicious local influence of some deleterious gas, and the very crowded\r\nstate the men slept in. It is also probable that they did not take off\r\ntheir accoutrements, and lay down with their belts on: might they not also\r\nhave eaten some unwholesome fruit upon the line of march, for it was in\r\nthe month of June, when various berries grow in abundance along the\r\nroad-side?\r\n\r\nHippocrates's theory of the night-mare was, that, during our sleep, our\r\nvolition being suspended, the soul, still awake, watches over all the\r\nfunctions of the body. It is rather odd that the animal that most persons\r\npretend to have thus annoyed them, is a long-haired black dog. Forestus\r\nassures us that it was a similar visiter that tormented him in his youth.\r\nThis circumstance can only be attributed to vulgar superstition and\r\ntradition. Dubosquet has preceded his Treatise on Ephialtes with the\r\nengraving of a large monkey who had perplexed a young lady whom he\r\nattended; the monkey most probably came on horseback, as his steed is also\r\ndelineated looking over the sleeping victim.\r\n\r\nVarious medicines have been recommended to prevent these attacks; amongst\r\nothers, saffron and peony: and several learned commentators have\r\nendeavoured to prove and disprove that they were only specific in the form\r\nof an amulet. Zacutus Lusitanus recommends aloes, and his advice is\r\nperhaps as good a one as could be given. The ancients attributed many\r\npowerful effects to saffron, and, amongst other properties, it was\r\nconsidered as an effective narcotic, and was said to occasion violent\r\nheadaches. Curious anecdotes are related of its effects. Amatus Lusitanus\r\nhaving exhibited this medicine to accelerate a tardy accouchement, the\r\nwoman was delivered of two yellow daughters; and Hertodt, in his work\r\ncalled Crocology, relates that, having tried it on a bitch, all her pups\r\nwere of a similar colour. The ancients called saffron the king of plants,\r\nthe vegetable panacea, and the soul of the lungs. In modern times we do\r\nnot recognise any peculiar property in this production; and in Spain and\r\nItaly it is used as a condiment with perfect impunity. Peony was also\r\ndeemed a valuable remedy, when gathered as the decreasing moon was passing\r\nunder Aries: the slit root being then tied round the neck of an epileptic\r\nperson, he was forthwith cured. \"Unlimited scepticism,\" Dugald Stewart\r\nobserves, \"is as much the child of imbecility as implicit credulity.\" How\r\ndifficult it is to steer the vessel of our understanding between those\r\nshoals!\r\n\r\nMedical writers have divided the night-mare, according to its phenomena,\r\ninto complete, incomplete, mental, and bodily. The complete night-mare, in\r\nwhich the suspension of the functions had been so powerful, has been known\r\nto prove fatal. In the incomplete, we fancy ourselves placed in a peculiar\r\nsituation, opposed by some unexpected obstacle, and all our efforts seem\r\nof no avail to extricate ourselves from our difficulties. There is an\r\nincubus, called indirect, in which the dreamer is not the individual\r\narrested in his movements; but he is impeded in his progress by the\r\nstoppage of his horse, his carriage, his ship, which no power can propel.\r\nIn the mental or intellectual night-mare, the flow of our ideas is\r\nembarrassed, all the associations of our very thoughts appear to be\r\nsingularly unconnected; we think in an unintelligible language; we write,\r\nand cannot decipher our manuscript: all is a mental chaos, and no thread\r\ncan lead us out of the perplexing labyrinth. In the corporeal ephialtes,\r\nwe imagine that some of our organs are displaced, or deranged in their\r\nfunctions. One man fancies that a malevolent spectre is drawing out his\r\nintestines or his teeth: a patient of Galen felt the cold sensation of a\r\nmarble statue having been put into bed with him. These, however, are\r\nnothing else than the actual sensations we experience at the time. Thus\r\nConrad Gesner fancied that a serpent had stung him in the left side of the\r\nbreast; an anthrax soon appeared upon the very spot, and terminated his\r\nexistence. Arnauld de Villeneuve imagined that his foot had been bitten,\r\nand a pimple which broke out on the spot soon degenerated into a fatal\r\ncancerous affection. Corporeal night-mare may therefore be simply\r\nconsidered as a symptom of disease, and not as a mysterious forewarning.\r\n\r\nThe cold stage of fever that often invades us in our sleep is the natural\r\nforerunner of the malady. This was the case with Dr. Corona, the physician\r\nof Pius VI. who upon two occasions was attacked with typhus fever, ushered\r\nin by a distressing dream or incubus. These physical phenomena only\r\nstrengthen the opinion, that in our sleep we are equally alive to mental\r\nimpressions and bodily sufferings; and that, correctly speaking, there is\r\nno suspension of our intellectual faculties of perception, nor is there\r\nany interruption in the susceptibilities of our relative existence. The\r\nvarious doctrines regarding dreams illustrate this position.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINCUBATION OF DISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"incubation\" in its rigid sense applies to the act of hatching\r\neggs, either naturally or artificially. It has however been adopted by\r\nphysicians to denote that state of predisposition to disease, in which the\r\ngerm of the malady lurks, latent and unperceived by the inexperienced\r\nobserver. Too frequently the individual who is thus menaced is totally\r\nunaware of his condition. So far from being depressed in spirits, his\r\nhopes are more sanguine, and his future projects more industriously formed\r\nthan usual. At other times, on the contrary, he labours under a load of\r\ndespondency which he cannot explain, and his gloom seems to anticipate his\r\nend. This presentiment has oftentimes been singularly prophetic. Moreau de\r\nSt. Remy relates the case of one of his most intimate friends, who visited\r\nhim, saying, \"I come to die near you.\" He was apparently in perfect\r\nhealth, but the prediction too soon proved true.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt probable, that in these cases the influence of the mind\r\nlabouring under these fatal impressions brings about, by its all-powerful\r\nsympathetic power on our functions, the expected yet dreaded event.\r\n\r\nIncubation is observed in many contagious affections; and in hydrophobia\r\nits duration is amazing, this dreadful malady developing itself years\r\nafter the original accident. In mental diseases, aberrations of the\r\nintellectual faculties are noticed long before the patient can be\r\npronounced insane; oddities, as they are called, are frequently the\r\nprecursors of mania.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks and Egyptians use the term \"incubation\" in another\r\nsense. With them it expressed the religious ceremony of sleeping in the\r\ntemples of the gods, to be inspired with the means of relieving their\r\nsufferings. Nothing can express this superstitious rite more forcibly than\r\nthe following letter from Aspasia to Pericles, recorded by one of the\r\nscholiasts of Aelian.\r\n\r\n\"Aspasia to Pericles, greeting. Podalirius! Podalirius, to whom Love\r\ntaught the art of healing, and who in return didst consecrate thine art to\r\nLove, I return thee my thanks. Athens will once more see me beauteous! I\r\nshall have lost none of my attractions, and Pericles shall find in his\r\nAspasia all that he once held dear! Podalirius, I return thee my thanks;\r\nand thou, Pericles, be grateful to my benefactor. I did not wish to write\r\nto thee until I was certain that I had been cured. I shall relate to thee\r\nmy voyage. I punctually followed the instructions of Nocrates, that wise\r\nand enlightened physician. I first repaired to Memphis, where I visited,\r\nbut without success, the temple of Isis. I there beheld the goddess, and\r\nher son Orus, seated on a throne, supported by two lions. The\r\n_Sebestus_[23] grew round her shrine! Incense was burnt in the morning,\r\nmyrrha during the day, and cyplis at eve. I was assured that young\r\nAlexander had come to this temple not long before to indulge in a holy\r\ncontemplation, and learn by inspiration the means of curing his friend\r\nPtolemy: his supplications were heeded. I also slept in the temple, but\r\nfound no relief. This misfortune, alas! was attributed to my incredulity.\r\nI took my departure, and repaired to Patras. There I saw in her temple the\r\ndivine Hygeia; not as she was represented by Aristophanes, when she\r\nrelieved Plutus, sweet and graceful, clothed in an aerial robe and a short\r\ntunic, and holding in her hand a cup of _Musa_, whence a serpent was seen\r\nto spring, but she appeared to me in the form of a mysterious pentagon. I\r\nfirst paid a devout visit to the fountain; and while I deposited my\r\nofferings at the feet of the goddess, a mirror was floating on the surface\r\nof the waters upon which I gazed by order of the priests, but I was not\r\ncured! Thence I went to sleep at Pergania and at Hercyna. But the gods\r\nseemed to slumber when Aspasia slept! On a sudden the name of Podalirius\r\nstruck mine ear! I was informed that his temple was at Lacera. I instantly\r\nsought it; and, on my arrival, bathed in the Althonus. After the bath, I\r\nwas anointed with the perfumed balsams that our friend Sosinius had given\r\nme in the temple of Mercury the day I left Athens. I then put up my\r\nprayers to deserve the favour I implored from the god. At nightfall I\r\nsought repose on the skin of a ram close to the statuary pillar. I soon\r\nfound myself in that state when we are no longer wide awake, but when\r\nsleep has not yet lulled our senses to repose. Methought that a celestial\r\nlight was shed around me. Aesculapius appeared to me with his two\r\ndaughters; and, from the clouds that surrounded him, he promised me my\r\npristine health. I soon after fell into a profound sleep; but towards the\r\nbreak of day I beheld Cypris--Cypris who was always the friend of\r\nPodalirius: she came herself! I recognised her, although she had assumed\r\nthe form of a gentle dove. Yes, Cypris came to cure me. Podalirius!\r\nAesculapius! Cypris! each day shall you be thanked by Aspasia and by\r\nPericles.\r\n\r\n\"I must now relate to thee the vision of a Daunian, who slept near me. She\r\nsuffered from an affection of her breast, and this she dreamed:--She\r\nbeheld the young god Harpocrates lying on leaves of lotos, and covered\r\nwith bandages from the head to the feet. He appeared weak and emaciated;\r\nhe cried like an infant, supplicating the poor woman to nurse him. Soon\r\nafter, she dreamt that a lamb came to seek his sustenance from her bosom.\r\nThe dream was fulfilled,--it clearly indicated the use of a certain plant;\r\nbut, until it could be obtained, the Daunian was advised to eat nothing\r\nbut stewed raisins. Learn that here various names are given to various\r\ninspirations. The last dream I have related is called _allegorical_. When\r\na dream prescribes a certain remedy, it is named _theorematic_. Here are\r\nmany dreams: wise Pericles, thou art perhaps smiling at them; but what is\r\n_not_ visionary is my perfect recovery, and my love for thee. Farewell!\"\r\n\r\nAlthough this letter of Aspasia is an evident fiction, yet it gives an\r\nexcellent, though a romantic description of the incubation of the\r\nancients. Aspasia was supposed to be labouring under one of the most\r\nvexatious disorders that can affect a pretty woman,--an eruption in the\r\nface; hence the gods sent her a mirror, that her devotion might be\r\nincreased by her unsightly appearance. It is not improbable that in those\r\ndays, as in the present era, women of a certain, or rather an uncertain\r\nage, were more fervid in their endeavours to render themselves acceptable\r\nto Heaven when they ceased to be admired and sought for upon earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUACKERY AND CHARLATANISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the word \"quack\" is not ascertained. Johnson derives it from\r\nthe verb \"_to quack_, or gabble like a goose.\" Butler uses this verb as\r\ndescriptive of the encomiums empirics heap upon their nostrums. Thus in\r\nHudibras:\r\n\r\n  Believe mechanic Virtuosi\r\n  Can raise them mountains in Potosi,\r\n  Seek out for plants with signatures\r\n  To _quack_ of universal cures.\r\n\r\nThe word _charlatan_ is equally enveloped in obscurity. Furetiere and\r\nCalepin say that it is derived from the Italian word _Ceretano_, from\r\n_Caeretum_, a town near Spoleto, whence a band of impostors first sallied\r\nforth, marching under the banners of Hippocrates, and roving from town to\r\ntown, selling drugs and giving medical advice.[24] Menage has it that\r\n_charlatan_ springs from _Circulatanus_, from _Circulator_. Other\r\netymologists trace it to the Italian _Ciarlare_, to chatter; hence\r\n_Ciarlatan_.\r\n\r\nThe Romans called their quacks _Agyrtae_, or _Seplasiarii_, from\r\n_Seplasium_, the generic name of aromatic substances. _Seplasium_ was the\r\nplace where they vended their drugs. Thus Martial:\r\n\r\n  Quodque ab Adumaeis vectum _seplasia_ vendunt,\r\n  Et quidquid confert medicis lagaea cataplus.\r\n\r\nAn empiric was also called _Planus_ and _Circulator_ \"_unde Plani unde\r\nlevatores_.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the stratagems resorted to by needy empirics to get into practice\r\nare very ingenious, and many a regular physician has been obliged to have\r\nrecourse to similar artifices to procure employment. It is related of a\r\nParisian physician, that, on his first arrival in the capital, he was in\r\nthe habit of sending his servant in a carriage about daybreak to rap at\r\nthe doors of the principal mansions to inquire for his master, as he was\r\nsent for to repair instantly to such and such a prince, who was dying. The\r\ndrowsy porter naturally replied, with much ill-humour, \"that he knew\r\nnothing of his master.\"--\"What! did he not pass the night in this house?\"\r\nreplied the footman, apparently astonished. \"No,\" gruffly answered the\r\nSwiss; \"there's nobody ill here.\"--\"Then I must have mistaken the house.\r\nIs not this the hotel of the Duke of ----?\"--\"No. Go to the devil!\"\r\nexclaimed the porter, closing the ponderous gates. From this house his\r\nvalet then proceeded from street to street, alarming the whole\r\nneighbourhood with his loud rap. Of course nothing else was spoken of in\r\nthe porter's lodge, the grocer's shop, and the servants' hall for nine\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAnother quack, upon his arrival in a town, announced himself by sending\r\nthe bellman round, offering fifty guineas reward for a poodle belonging to\r\nDoctor ----, Physician to his Majesty and the Royal Family, Professor of\r\nMedicine, and Surgeon General, who had put up at such and such an inn. Of\r\ncourse the physician of a king, who could give fifty guineas for a lost\r\ndog, must be a man of pre-eminence in his profession.\r\n\r\nAnother indigent physician having complained of his ill-fortune to an\r\ningenious friend, received the following advice: The _Cafe de la Regence_\r\nis now in fashion: I play at chess every day at two o'clock, when a\r\nconsiderable crowd is assembled. Come there at the same hour; do not\r\npretend to know me; call for a cup of coffee, and always pay the waiter\r\nhis money in a rose-coloured paper: leave the rest to me. The doctor\r\nfollowed his advice; and his eccentric manners were soon observed,--when\r\nhis friend informed the persons around him, that he was one of the ablest\r\npractitioners in the land; that he had known him for upwards of fifteen\r\nyears, and that his cures were most marvellous,--his extreme modesty alone\r\nhaving prevented him from giving publicity to his abilities. He further\r\nadded, I have long wished to become intimate with so great a man; but he\r\nis so absorbed in the study of his profession, that he scarcely ever\r\nenters into conversation with any one. In a short time, the Rose-colour\r\nDoctor was in extensive business.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, the jaw-breaking words _Tetrachymagogon_ and _Fellino\r\nGuffino Cardimo Cardimac Frames_, were chalked all over London, as two\r\nmiracle-working doctors. Men with such names must have some superior\r\nqualification, and numbers flocked to consult them. Another quack put up\r\nas an advertisement, that he had just arrived in town, after having made\r\nthe wonderful discovery of the green and red dragon and the female\r\nfern-seed. This was sure to attract notice. An advertisement was handed\r\nabout of a learned physician, \"who had studied thirty years by\r\ncandle-light for the good of his countrymen.\" He was, moreover, the\r\nseventh son of a seventh son, and was possessed of a wonderful cure for\r\nhernia, as both his father and his grandfather had been ruptured. This\r\nreminds one of the oculist in Mouse Alley, mentioned in the Spectator, who\r\nundertook to cure cataracts, in consequence of his having lost an eye in\r\nthe Imperial service. Dr. Case made a fortune by having the lines, _Within\r\nthis place, lives Doctor Case_, written in large characters upon his door.\r\n\r\nThe accidental circumstances which frequently bring medical men into\r\nextensive practice, or that notoriety which may lead to it, are truly\r\ncurious. It is well known that a most eminent English physician owed all\r\nhis success to his having been on a particular occasion in a state of\r\nintoxication. Disappointed on his first arrival in London, he sought\r\ncomfort in a neighbouring tavern, where the servant of the house at which\r\nhe lodged went to fetch him one evening, after a heavy potation, to see a\r\ncertain countess. The high-sounding title of this unexpected patient\r\ntended not a little to increase the excitement under which he laboured. He\r\nfollowed a livery footman as steadily as he could, and was ushered in\r\nsilence into a noble mansion, where her ladyship's woman anxiously waited\r\nto conduct him most discreetly to her mistress's room; her agitation most\r\nprobably preventing her from perceiving the doctor's state. He was\r\nintroduced into a splendid bedchamber, and staggered towards the bed in\r\nwhich the lady lay. He went through the routine practice of pulse-feeling,\r\n&c., and proceeded to the table to write a prescription, which, in all\r\nprobability, would have been mechanically correct. But here his powers\r\nfailed him. In vain he strove to trace the salutary characters, until,\r\nwearied in his attempts, he cast down the pen, and, exclaiming \"Drunk, by\r\nG--!\" he made his best way out of the house. Two days afterwards he was\r\nnot a little surprised by receiving a letter from the lady, enclosing a\r\ncheck for 100_l._, and promising him the patronage of her family and\r\nfriends, if he would observe the strictest secrecy on the state he found\r\nher in. The fact simply was, that the countess had been indulging in\r\nbrandy and laudanum, which her abigail had procured for her, and was\r\nherself in the very condition which the doctor had frankly applied to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nChance, more than science or ability, has frequently brought professional\r\nmen to the summit of their business. There is an Eastern story of a\r\ncertain prince who had received from a fairy the faculty of not only\r\nassuming whatever appearance he thought proper, but of discerning the\r\nwandering spirits of the departed. He had long laboured under a painful\r\nchronic disease, that none of the court physicians, ordinary or\r\nextraordinary, could relieve; and he resolved to wander about the streets\r\nof his capital until he could find some one, regular or irregular, who\r\ncould alleviate his sufferings. For this purpose he donned the garb and\r\nappearance of a dervish. As he was passing through one of the principal\r\nstreets, he was surprised to see it so thronged with ghosts, that, had\r\nthey been still inhabitants of their former earthly tenements, they must\r\nhave obstructed the thoroughfare. But what was his amazement and dismay\r\nwhen he saw that they were all grouped with anxious looks round the door\r\nof his royal father's physician, haunting, no doubt, the man to whom they\r\nattributed their untimely doom. Shocked with the sight, he hurried to\r\nanother part of the city, where resided another physician of the court,\r\nholding the second rank in fashionable estimation. Alas! his gateway was\r\nalso surrounded with reproachful departed patients. Thunderstruck at such\r\na discovery, and returning thanks to the prophet that he was still in\r\nbeing, despite the practice of these great men, he resolved to submit all\r\nthe other renowned practitioners to a similar visit, and he was grieved to\r\nfind that the scale of ghosts kept pace with the scale of their medical\r\nrank. Heartbroken, and despairing of a cure, he was slowly sauntering back\r\nto the palace, when, in an obscure street, and on the door of an humble\r\ndwelling, he read a doctor's name. One single poor solitary ghost, leaning\r\nhis despondent cheek upon his fleshless hand, was seated on the doctor's\r\nsteps. \"Alas!\" exclaimed the prince, \"it is, then, too true that humble\r\nmerit withers in the shade, while ostentatious ignorance inhabits golden\r\nmansions. This poor neglected doctor, who has but one unlucky case to\r\nlament, is then the only man in whom I can place confidence.\" He rapped;\r\nthe door was opened by the doctor himself, a venerable old man, not rich\r\nenough, perhaps, to keep a domestic to answer his infrequent calls. His\r\nwhite locks and flowing beard added to the confidence which his situation\r\nhad inspired. The elated youth then related at full length all his\r\ncomplicated ailments, and the still more complicated treatment to which he\r\nhad in vain been submitted. The sapient physician was not illiberal enough\r\nto say that the prince's attendants had all been in error, since all\r\nmankind may err; but his sarcastic smile, the curl of his lips, and the\r\ndubious shake of his hoary head, most eloquently told the anxious patient\r\nthat he considered his former physicians as an ignorant, murderous set of\r\nupstarts, only fit to depopulate a community. With a triumphant look he\r\npromised a cure, and gave his overjoyed client a much-valued prescription,\r\nwhich he carefully confided to his bosom; after which he expressed his\r\ngratitude by pouring upon the doctor's table a purse of golden sequins,\r\nwhich made the old man's blinking eyes shine as brightly as the coin he\r\nbeheld in wondrous delight. His joy gave suppleness to his rigid spine,\r\nand, after bowing the prince out in the most obsequious manner, he\r\nventured to ask him one humble question: \"By what good luck, by what kind\r\nplanet, had he been recommended to seek his advice?\" The prince naturally\r\nasked for the reason of so strange a question: to which the worthy doctor\r\nreplied, with eyes brimful with tears of gratitude, \"Oh, sir, because I\r\nconsidered myself the most unfortunate man in Bagdad until this happy\r\nmoment; for I have been settled in this noble and wealthy city for these\r\nlast fifteen years, and have only been able to obtain one single\r\npatient.\"--\"Ah!\" cried the prince in despair, \"then it must be that poor,\r\nsolitary, unhappy-looking ghost that is now sitting on your steps!\"\r\n\r\nIt has been observed that religious sects have materially contributed to\r\nthe elevation of physicians in society, and political associations have\r\nbeen equally beneficial. The celebrated Mead was the son of a\r\nnon-conforming minister, who, knowing the influence he possessed over his\r\nnumerous congregation, brought him up as a physician, in the full\r\nconfidence of obtaining the splendid result that rewarded the speculation.\r\nHis example was followed by several dissenting preachers; among whom we\r\nmay name Oldfield, Clarke, Nesbitt, Lobb, Munckly, whose sons all rose to\r\nextensive and most lucrative practice. At that period, St. Thomas's and\r\nGuy's Hospitals were under the government of Dissenters and Whigs; and so\r\nsoon as any one became a physician to the establishment, his fortune was\r\nmade. The same advantages attended St. Bartholomew's and Bethlem, both of\r\nroyal foundation.\r\n\r\nDr. Meyer Schomberg, who was a poor Jew of Cologne, came to London without\r\nany profession, when, not knowing what to do to obtain a living, to use\r\nhis own words, he said, \"I am a physician;\" and, having thus conferred a\r\ndegree upon himself, he sedulously cultivated the acquaintance of all his\r\nfellow Jews about Duke's-place, got introduced to some of their leading\r\nand wealthy mercantile brethren, and a few years after Dr. Schomberg was\r\nin the annual receipt of four thousand pounds. It is rather strange, but\r\nthe Jew was succeeded in his lucrative practice by a Quaker. This was the\r\ncelebrated Dr. Fothergill. Brought up an apothecary, he took out a Scotch\r\ndegree, and, attaching himself to Schomberg, calculated on following his\r\nexample; and, on his patron's decease, he slipped into the practice of\r\nboth Jew and Gentile.\r\n\r\nAmongst many singular instances of good fortune may be mentioned a surgeon\r\nof the name of Broughton, to whom our East India Company may consider\r\nthemselves as most indebted, since he was the person who first pointed out\r\nthe advantages that might result from trading in Bengal. Broughton\r\nhappened to travel from Surat to Agra in the year 1636, when he had the\r\nluck to cure one of the daughters of the Emperor _Shah-Jehan_. To reward\r\nhim, this prince allowed him a free trade throughout his dominions.\r\nBroughton immediately repaired to Bengal to purchase goods, which he sent\r\nround by sea to Surat. Scarcely had he returned, when he was requested to\r\nattend the favourite of a powerful nabob, and he fortunately restored her\r\nto health, when, in addition to a pension, his commercial privileges were\r\nstill more widely extended; the prince promising him at the same time a\r\nfavourable reception for British traders. Broughton lost no time in\r\ncommunicating this intelligence to the Governor of Surat; and it was by\r\nhis advice that the company sent out two large ships to Bengal in 1640.\r\n\r\nThere are some amusing anecdotes related regarding a vocation for the\r\nmedical profession. Andrew Rudiger, a physician of Leipsic, when at\r\ncollege, made an anagram of his name, and, in the words _Andreas Rudiger_\r\nhe found \"_Arare Rus Dei Dignus_,\" or \"worthy to cultivate the field of\r\nGod.\" He immediately fancied that his vocation was the church, and\r\ncommenced his theological studies. Showing but little disposition for the\r\nclerical calling, the learned Thomasius recommended him to return to his\r\noriginal pursuits. Rudiger confessed that he had more inclination for the\r\nprofession of medicine than the church; but that he had considered the\r\nanagram of his name as a divine injunction. \"There you are in error,\"\r\nreplied Thomasius; \"that very anagram calls you to the art of healing; for\r\n_Rus Dei_ clearly meaneth the churchyard.\"\r\n\r\nThe subject of quackery, in every sphere of life, whether it be resorted\r\nto by diplomatists or physicians, sanctimonious adventurers or fashionable\r\n_roues_, leads to serious consideration. How comes it that man seems more\r\nanxious to be deceived than enlightened? Simply from the errors of his\r\neducation, which foster a love for the marvellous, and induce him to\r\nadmire that which really is not or cannot be comprehended. The superiority\r\nof the intellectual faculties of the ancients, at an earlier age than the\r\ngenerality of men in the present times, is solely to be attributed to\r\ntheir having been brought up with philosophical views. Mallebranche has\r\njustly said, \"that to become a philosopher, we must _see clearly_; but to\r\nbe endued with faith, we must _believe blindly_.\" Although we cannot admit\r\nthis axiom in matters of revealed religion, yet in many worldly concerns\r\nit does hold. If a youth was not educated with the scholastic jargon,\r\ncommonly called learning, he would be considered ignorant. Helvetius has\r\nsaid, that man is born ignorant, but not a fool; and that it is even no\r\neasy matter to make him one; and the same writer has very justly divided\r\nstupidity into that which is natural, arising from ignorance, and that\r\nwhich is acquired and the result of instruction. It is thus that, by\r\nspeaking to the passions, naturally weak, and to our desires and\r\napprehensions, ever ready to grasp at a favourite phantom,--the artful\r\nmanage to exercise a more powerful control, and incline persons to believe\r\nwhat their senses actually discredit. The traffic of hope and fear has\r\never been a lucrative trade; and while fear became the staple commodity of\r\npriestcraft, hope was the fortune of medical quacks. The multiplication of\r\nsins increased the profits of the one; the various diseases, real and\r\nimaginary, to which flesh is heir, became the source of emolument to the\r\nother. It is under these cherished impressions of ameliorating our\r\ncondition, that many men of common sense, and even of judgment, are\r\ninduced to rely on the most absurd and fallacious promises; so prone are\r\nwe to believe all that we wish;--the fidelity of a woman, the truth of a\r\nsycophant, and the candour of a flatterer. If there could be established a\r\nregular college of quackery, where the errors of mankind might be studied,\r\nand pupils taught to avail themselves of their follies, as a future\r\nvocation, a more perfect knowledge of the world would be acquired than in\r\nall the universities in Europe. Our sovereigns would be wise in selecting\r\ntheir ministers amongst the graduates of this academy. Cardinal Du Perron,\r\nwho, in a long homily, convinced his sovereign, Henry III., of the\r\nexistence of a God, and afterwards informed him that he would prove the\r\ncontrary, if it could afford his Majesty any consolation, might have been\r\nselected as a proper rector for such an institution.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be observed that the founders of all doctrines, however\r\nhypothetical and absurd, have generally assumed a dogmatic language, which\r\ngives to their fallacious assertions an appearance of truth, and Bacon has\r\nlong ago said, \"Method, carrying a show of total and perfect knowledge,\r\nhas a tendency to general acquiescence.\"\r\n\r\nQuackery is considered by many practitioners as necessary to forward the\r\nviews of medical men. It is related of Charles Patin, that being on a\r\nvisit to a physician at Basle, where his son was studying medicine, he\r\nquestioned the youth on the principal studies required to form a\r\nphysician; to which the future candidate for medical popularity replied,\r\n\"Anatomy, physiology, pathology, and therapeutics.\" \"You have omitted the\r\nchief pursuit,\" replied his catechiser, \"_quackery_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen we cast our eyes on the absurd names which many Italian academies\r\nadopted to characterize the nature of their studies, we find an ample\r\nillustration of this science in the _Seraphici_, the _Oscuri_, the\r\n_Immaturi_, the _Infecundi_, the _Offuscati_, the _Somnolenti_, and\r\n_Phantastici_!\r\n\r\nThe most ridiculous and disgusting epithets have been considered\r\nhonourable distinctions. Thus, when the science of _Uroscopia_ and\r\n_Uromancy_ prevailed, we find a Dr. Theodorus Charles, a Wirtemberg\r\nphysician, calling another learned practitioner, \"_Urinosa Claritas_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE USE OF TEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch is the growing consumption of this now indispensable article in\r\nEngland, that in 1789 there were imported 14,534,601 lbs., and in 1833 the\r\nquantity was increased to 31,829,620 lbs.; the latter importation yielding\r\na revenue of 3,444,101_l._ In other countries we find the consumption much\r\nless. Russia in 1832 imported 6,461,064 lbs.; Holland consumes about\r\n2,800,000 lbs., and France only 230,000 lbs.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that tea was first introduced into Europe by the Dutch,\r\nabout the middle of the seventeenth century; and Lords Arlington and\r\nOssory are said to be the first persons who made it known in England. In\r\n1641, Tulpius, a Dutch physician, mentioned it in his works. In 1667,\r\nFouquet, a French physician, recommended it to the French faculty; and in\r\n1678, an elaborate treatise was written on it by Cornelius Boutkoe,\r\nphysician to the Elector of Brandenburg. About the same time, several\r\ntravellers and missionaries, amongst whom we find Koempfer, Kalm,\r\nOsbeck, Duhalde, and Lecomte, give various accounts of the plant and its\r\ndivers qualities.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese name of this plant is _theh_, a _Fokien_ word. In the Mandarin\r\nit is _tcha_, and the Japanese call it _tsjaa_. _Loureiro_, in his _Flora\r\nCochin-China_, describes three species of tea. It is a polyandrous plant\r\nof the natural order _Columniferae_, growing to a height varying from three\r\nto six feet, and bearing a great resemblance to our myrtle. The blossom is\r\nwhite, with yellow style and anthers, not unlike that of the dog-rose; the\r\nleaves are the only valuable part of the plant. The _camellias_,\r\nparticularly the _camellia sesanqua_, of the same natural family, are the\r\nonly plants liable to be confounded with it. The leaves of the latter\r\ncamellia are indeed frequently used as a substitute for those of the\r\ntea-plant in several districts of China. This shrub is a hardy evergreen,\r\ngrowing in the open air from the equator to the forty-fifth degree of\r\nnorthern latitude; but the climate that appears the most congenial to it\r\nseems to be between the twenty-fifth and thirty-third degree. Almost every\r\nprovince and district in China produces tea for local consumption: but\r\nwhat is cultivated for trade is chiefly in Fokien, Canton, Kiang-nan,\r\nKiang-si, and Che-Kiang; Fokien being celebrated for its black tea, and\r\nKiang-nan for the green. The plant is also cultivated in Japan, Tonquin,\r\nand Cochin-China, and in some parts of the mountainous tracts of Ava,\r\nwhere, in addition to its use in infusion, it is converted into a pickle\r\npreserved in oil. When tea was first introduced as a luxury on particular\r\noccasions in the wild districts of Ireland, the people used to throw away\r\nthe water in which it had been boiled, and eat the leaves with salt-butter\r\nor bacon like greens. The Dutch are now endeavouring to propagate this\r\nvaluable plant in Java, and for that purpose employ cultivators, who have\r\nemigrated from Fokien. The Brazilians are making similar attempts, and\r\nsome tolerable tea has been reared near Rio Janeiro.\r\n\r\nThe black teas usually imported from Canton are the _bohea_, _congou_,\r\n_souchong_, and _pekoe_, according to our orthography: the French\r\nmissionaries spelt them as follows: _boui_, _camphou_ or _campoui_,\r\n_saotchaon_, and _pekao_ or _peko_. Our green teas are the _twankay_,\r\n_hyson-skin_, and _hyson_, _imperial_, and _gunpowder_; the first of which\r\nFrench travellers write _tonkay_, _hayswin-skine_, and _hayswin_. The\r\nFrench import a tea called _tehulan_, but it is artificially flavoured\r\nwith a leaf called _lan hoa_, or the _olea fragrans_ of Linnaeus.\r\n\r\nThe tea-plant grows to perfection in two or three years: the leaves are\r\ncarefully picked by the family of the growers, and immediately carried to\r\nmarket, where they are purchased for drying in sheds. The tea-merchants\r\nfrom Canton repair to the several districts where it is produced, and,\r\nafter purchasing the leaves thus simply desiccated, submit them to various\r\nmanipulations; after which they are packed in branded cases and parcels\r\ncalled _chops_, from a Chinese word meaning a seal. Some of the leaf-buds\r\nof the finest black tea plants are picked early in the spring, before they\r\nexpand: these constitute _pekoe_, sometimes called \"white-blossomed tea,\"\r\nfrom their being intermixed with the blossoms of the _olea fragrans_. The\r\nyounger the leaf, the more high-flavoured and valuable is the tea. Green\r\nteas are grown and gathered in the same manner; but amongst these the\r\ngunpowder stands in the grade of the _pekoe_ among the black, being\r\nprepared with the unopened buds of the spring crops. The alleged\r\npreparation of green teas upon copper plates, to give them a verdant\r\ncolour, is an idle story. They are dried in iron vases over a gentle fire;\r\nand the operator conducts this delicate work with his naked hand, and the\r\nutmost care not to break the fragile leaves. This part of the\r\nmanipulation is considered the most difficult, as the leaves are rolled\r\ninto their usual shape between the palms of the hands until they are cold,\r\nto prevent them from unrolling. Teas are adulterated by various\r\nodoriferous plants, more especially the _vitex pinnata_, the _chloranthus\r\ninconspicuus_, and the _illicium anisatum_. In our markets the chief\r\nadulteration is operated by the mixture of sloe and ash leaves, and\r\ncolouring with terra Japonica and other drugs.\r\n\r\nThat tea is a substance injurious to health is beyond a doubt. Nothing but\r\nlong habit from early life renders it less baneful than it otherwise would\r\nbe: persons who take its infusion for the first time invariably experience\r\nuncomfortable sensations. It is well known that individuals who are not in\r\nthe practice of taking tea in the evening, never transgress this habit\r\nwith impunity; and it is quite clear that a preparation which deprives\r\nthem of sleep, and renders them restless during a whole night, cannot be\r\nsalubrious by day; and although the following opinion of Dr. Trotter\r\nregarding the use of this leaf is somewhat exaggerated, it is founded on\r\nexperience; and I have known several persons afflicted with a variety of\r\nserious affections who never could obtain relief until they had ceased to\r\nconsume it.\r\n\r\n\"Tea is a beverage well suited to the taste of an indolent and voluptuous\r\nage. To the glutton it affords a grateful diluent after a voracious\r\ndinner; and, from being drunk warm, it gives a soothing stimulus to the\r\nstomach of the drunkard: but, however agreeable may be its immediate\r\nflavour, the ultimate effects are debility and nervous diseases. There may\r\nbe conditions of health, indeed, where tea can do no harm, such as in the\r\nstrong and athletic; but it is particularly hurtful to the female\r\nconstitution, to all persons who possess the hereditary predisposition to\r\ndyspepsia, and all diseases with which it is associated, to gout, and to\r\nthose who are naturally weak-nerved. Fine tea, where the narcotic quality\r\nseems to be concentrated, when taken in a strong infusion, by persons not\r\naccustomed to it, excites nausea and vomiting, tremors, cold sweats,\r\nvertigo, dimness of sight, and confusion of thought. I have known a number\r\nof men and women subject to nervous complaints, who could not use tea in\r\nany form without feeling a sudden increase of all their unpleasant\r\nsymptoms; particularly acidity of the stomach, vertigo, and dimness of the\r\neyes. As the use of this article of diet extends among the lower orders of\r\nthe community and the labouring poor, it must do the more harm. A man or\r\na woman who has to go through much toil and hardship has need of\r\nsubstantial nourishment; but that is not to be obtained from an infusion\r\nof tea. And if the humble returns of their industry are expended in this\r\nleaf, what remains for the purchase of food better adapted to labour? In\r\nthis case tea becomes hurtful, not only from its narcotic quality, but\r\nbecause that quality acts with double force in a body weakened from other\r\ncauses. This certainly is one great reason for the increased and\r\nincreasing proportion of nervous, bilious, spasmodic, and stomach\r\ncomplaints, &c. appearing among the lower ranks of life.\"\r\n\r\nIt is well known that tea is frequently resorted to by literary men to\r\nkeep them awake during their lucubrations. Dr. Cullen said he never could\r\ntake it without feeling gouty symptoms; and we frequently see aged\r\nfemales, who are in the habit of taking strong green tea, subject to\r\nparalytic affections. Many experienced physicians, such as Grimm,\r\nCrugerus, Wytt, Murray, Letsom, condemn the abuse of the plant as highly\r\ndangerous.[25] That it is a most powerful astringent we well know; and the\r\nhands of the Chinese who are employed in its preparation are shrivelled,\r\nand, to all appearance, burned with caustic. Chemists have extracted from\r\nit an astringent liquor containing tannin and gallic acid. This liquor,\r\ninjected in the veins or under the integuments of frogs, produces palsy of\r\nthe posterior extremities, and, applied to the sciatic nerve for half an\r\nhour, has occasioned death.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that tea acts differently on various individuals. In\r\nsome it is highly stimulant and exhilarating; in others its effects are\r\noppression and lowness of spirits; and I have known a person who could\r\nnever indulge in this beverage without experiencing a disposition to\r\ncommit suicide, and nothing could arouse him from this state of morbid\r\nexcitement but the pleasure of destroying something, books, papers, or any\r\nthing within his reach. Under no other circumstances than this influence\r\nof tea were these fearful aberrations observed. It has been remarked that\r\nall tea-drinking nations are essentially of a leucophlegmatic temperament,\r\npredisposed to scrofulous and nervous diseases. The Chinese, even the\r\ndegraded Tartar races amongst them, are weak and infirm, their women\r\nsubject to various diseases arising from debility. Although their\r\nconfined mode of living, and want of the means of enjoying pure air and\r\nexercise, materially tends to render them liable to these affections;\r\nstill their immoderate use of strong green tea, taken, it is true, in very\r\nsmall quantities at the time, but repeatedly, greatly adds to this\r\npredisposition.\r\n\r\nFrom long experience I am convinced that, although tea may in general be\r\nconsidered a refreshing and harmless beverage, yet in some peculiar cases\r\nit is decidedly injurious; and many diseases that have baffled all medical\r\nexertions, have yielded to the same curative means so soon as the action\r\nof tea had been suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANDRAGORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSelf-styled wandering Turks and Armenians are frequently met with in\r\ncrowded cities vending rhubarb, tooth-powder, and various drugs and\r\nnostrums, exciting the curiosity of the idlers that group around them, by\r\nexhibiting a root bearing a strong resemblance to the human form. This is\r\nthe far-famed mandragore, of which such wonderful accounts have been\r\nrelated by both ancients and moderns.\r\n\r\nThis plant is the _Atropa Mandragora_ of Linnaeus, and grows wild in the\r\nmountainous and shaded parts of Italy, Spain, and the Levant, where it is\r\nalso cultivated in gardens. The root bears such a likeness, at least in\r\nfancy's eyes, to our species, that it was called _Semi-homo_. Hence says\r\nColumella,\r\n\r\n  Quamvis semihominis vesano gramine foeta\r\n  Mandragora pariat flores moestamque cicutam.\r\n\r\nThe word _vesano_ clearly refers to the supposed power it possessed of\r\nexciting delirium. It was also named _Circaea_, from its having been one of\r\nthe mystic ingredients employed in Circe's spells; although the wonderful\r\nmandragore was ineffectual against the more powerful herb the _Moly_,\r\nwhich Ulysses received from Mercury. This human resemblance of the root,\r\nwhich is, moreover, of a blackish hue and hairy, inspired the vulgar with\r\nthe idea that it was nothing less than a familiar daemon. It was gathered\r\nwith curious rites: three times a magic circle was drawn round it with a\r\nnaked sword; and the person who was daring enough to pluck it from the\r\nearth, was subject to manifold dangers and diseases, unless under some\r\nspecial protection; therefore it was not unusual to get it eradicated by a\r\ndog, fastened to it by a cord, and who was whipped off until the precious\r\nroot was pulled out. According to Josephus, the plant called _Buaras_,\r\nwhich was gifted with the faculty of keeping off evil spirits, was\r\nobtained by a similar canine operation. Often, it was asserted, did the\r\nmandragore utter piteous cries and groans, when thus severed from mother\r\nearth. Albertus the Great affirms that the root has a more powerful action\r\nwhen growing under a gibbet, and is brought to greater perfection by the\r\nnourishing secretions that drop from the criminal's dangling corpse.\r\n\r\nAmongst its many wonderful properties, it was said to double the amount of\r\nmoney that was locked up with it in a box. It was also all-powerful in\r\ndetecting hidden treasures. Most probably the mandragore had bad qualities\r\nto underrate its good ones. Amongst these, we must certainly class the\r\nblackest ingratitude, since it never seemed to benefit the eloquent\r\nadvocates of its virtues, who, in general, were as poor as their boasted\r\nplant was rich in attraction.\r\n\r\nIt was also supposed to possess the delightful faculty of increasing\r\npopulation and exciting love; and the Emperor Julian writes to Calixines\r\nthat he is drinking the juice of mandragore to render him amorous. Hence\r\nwas it called _Loveapple_; and Venus bore the name of _Mandragontis_. It\r\nhas been asserted by various scholiasts, that the _mandrake_ which Reuben\r\nfound in the fields and carried to his mother, Leah, was the mandragore;\r\nthe _Dudaim_, however, which he gathered was not, according to all\r\naccounts, an unpleasant fruit, but is supposed to have been a species of\r\norchis, still used in the East in love-philters and prolific potions. The\r\nword _Dudaim_ seems to express a tuberculated plant; and in Solomon's\r\nSongs, he thus describes it: \"The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates\r\nare all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for\r\nthee, O my beloved.\" Now it is utterly impossible, whatever may have been\r\nthe revolution in taste since the days of Solomon, that the nauseous and\r\noffensive mandragore could have been considered as a propitiating present\r\nto a lady.\r\n\r\nThe etymology of the word _Dudaim_ would seem to describe it. It is\r\nderived from the word [Hebrew], (_Dadim_) breasts, or [Hebrew], (_Dodim_)\r\nfriends, neighbours, twins; which indicates that this plant is formed of\r\ntwo similar parts. It is thought that the _Dudaim_ might be the\r\nhighly-scented melon which is cultivated in the East, especially in\r\nPersia, and known by the name of _Destenbuje_, or the _Cucumis Dudaim_ of\r\nLinnaeus, and which is also found in Italy, where its powerful aroma is\r\nimparted to garments and chambers. It must have been an odoriferous\r\nproduction, since in the _Talmud_ we find it denominated _Siglin_, which\r\nhas been considered the jessamine or the lily. The orchis is remarkable\r\nfor its double bulbous roots and its agreeable perfume; we may therefore\r\njustify the idea that the _Dudaim_ of the Jews was a species of this\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nFrontinus informs us that Hannibal employed mandragore in one of his\r\nwarlike stratagems, when he feigned a retreat, and left in the possession\r\nof the barbarians a quantity of wine in which this plant had been infused.\r\nIntoxicated by the potent beverage, they were unable to withstand his\r\nsecond attack, and were easily put to the sword. Was it the mandragore\r\nthat saved the Scotch in a similar _ruse de guerre_ with the Danish\r\ninvaders of Sweno? It is supposed to have been the _Belladonna_, or deadly\r\nnightshade, the effects of which are not dissimilar to those of the plant\r\nin question.\r\n\r\nIn the north of Europe, this substance is still used for medicinal\r\npurposes; and Boerhaave, Hoffberg, and Swediaur have strongly recommended\r\nit in glandular swellings, arthritic pains, and various diseases where a\r\nprofuse perspiration may be desirable.\r\n\r\nMachiavel has made the fabulous powers of the mandragore the subject of a\r\ncomedy, and Lafontaine has employed it as an agent in one of his tales.\r\n\r\nAnother root that excited superstitious phantasies and reverential awe,\r\nfrom its supposed resemblance to the human form, was the Gin-seng, a\r\nChinese production, which, according to the author of the\r\n_Kao-li-tchi-tsan_, or Eulogium of the Kingdom of Corea, \"imitates the\r\nconfiguration of man and the efficacy of spiritual comfort, possessing\r\nhands and feet like a human being, and the mental virtues that no one can\r\neasily comprehend.\" According to Jartoux, _Gin-seng_ signifies \"the\r\nrepresentation of man.\" It appears, however, that the learned father was\r\nin error. _Jin_, it is true, signifies _man_; but _Chen_ does not mean\r\nrepresentation, but a _ternary body_. Hence _Gin-seng_ signifies the\r\n_ternary of man, making three with man and heaven_!--no doubt some\r\nsuperstitious tradition, since this root bears various names in other\r\ncountries, that plainly denote the veneration in which it was held. In\r\nJapan it is called _Nindsin_, and _Orkhoda_ in the Tatar-Mandchou\r\nlanguage, both of which mean \"the queen of plants.\" Father Lafitau\r\ninforms us that the name of _Garent-oguen_ of the Iroquois, which it also\r\nbears, means the _thighs of man_. The _Gin-seng_ is a native of Tartary,\r\nCorea, and also thrives in Canada, Virginia, and Pennsylvania, in shaded\r\nand damp situations, as it soon perishes under the solar rays. The Chinese\r\nattach considerable value to it. Thunberg informs us that it sometimes is\r\nsold for forty pounds a pound; and Osbeck states that in his time it was\r\nworth twenty-four times its weight in silver. This enormous price\r\nfrequently induced foreign smugglers to bring it into the Chinese\r\nterritory; but the severest laws were enacted to punish this fraudulent\r\ntraffic. The Tartars alone possess the privilege of cultivating and\r\ncollecting it; and the districts that produce this precious plant are\r\nsurrounded with palisades, and strictly guarded. In 1707, the Emperor of\r\nChina, to increase his revenue, sent a body of ten thousand troops to\r\ncollect the gin-seng. According to the Chinese physicians, this root\r\npossesses the faculty of renovating exhausted constitutions, giving fresh\r\nvigour, raising the drooping moral and physical faculties, and restoring\r\nto health and _embonpoint_ the victim of debauchery. It is also said that\r\na bit of the root chewed by a man running a race will prevent his\r\ncompetitor from getting the start of him. It is somewhat singular that the\r\nsame property is attributed to garlic; and the Hungarian jockeys\r\nfrequently tie a clove of it to their racers' bits, when the horses that\r\nrun against them fall back the moment they breathe the offensive odour. It\r\nhas been proved that no horse will eat in a manger if the mouth of any\r\nother steed in the stable has been rubbed with the juice of this plant. I\r\nhad occasion to ascertain this fact. A horse of mine was in the same stall\r\nwith one belonging to a brother officer; mine fell away and refused his\r\nfood, while his companion throve uncommonly well. I at last discovered\r\nthat a German groom, who had charge of the prosperous animal, had recourse\r\nto this vile stratagem. It is also supposed that men who eat garlic knock\r\nup upon a march the soldiers who have not made use of it. Hence, in the\r\nold regulations of the French armies, there existed an order to prohibit\r\nthe use of garlic when troops were on a march.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBARBER-SURGEONS, AND THE PROGRESS OF CHIRURGICAL ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo consideration should render man more thankful to his Creator, and\r\njustly proud of the progress of human intellect, than the perfection to\r\nwhich the art of surgery has been carried. In its present improved\r\ncondition, we are struck with horror at the perusal of the ancient\r\npractice, and marvel that its barbarity did not sooner induce its\r\nprofessors to diminish the sum of misery it inflicted on their victims.\r\nIgnorance, and its offspring Superstition, seemed to sanctify this\r\ndarkness. Improvement was considered as impious and unnecessary; and to\r\ndeny the powers of the chirurgical art, heresy against the holy men, who\r\nalone were permitted to exercise it.\r\n\r\nThis supposed divine attribute of the priesthood can be traced to remote\r\nages: Aesculapius was son of Apollo, and princes and heroes did not\r\nconsider the art of surgery beneath their dignity. Homer has illustrated\r\nthe skill of Podalirius and Chiron; and Idomeneus bids Nestor to mount his\r\nchariot with Machaon, who alone was more precious than a thousand\r\nwarriors; while we find Podalirius, wrecked and forlorn on the Carian\r\ncoast, leading to the altar the daughter of the monarch whom he cured, and\r\nwhose subjects raised a temple to his memory, and paid him divine honours.\r\n\r\nTradition informs us, that in the infancy of the art all its branches were\r\nexercised indiscriminately by the medical practitioners. It was not then\r\nsupposed that the human body was subject to distinct affections, external\r\nand internal; yet, as its study advanced, the ancients were led into an\r\nopposite extreme, and we find that in Egypt each disease became the\r\nprovince of a special attendant, regulated in his treatment by the sacred\r\nrecords handed down by their hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHerodotus informs us, that \"so wisely was medicine managed by the\r\nEgyptians, that no physician was allowed to practise any but his own\r\npeculiar branch.\" Accouchments were exclusively the province of females.\r\n\r\nThese practitioners were remunerated by the state; and they were severely\r\npunished, when, by any experimental trials, they deviated from the\r\nprescribed rules imposed upon them, and, in the event of any patient\r\ndying under a treatment differing from the established practice, the\r\nmedical attendant was considered guilty of a capital offence. These wise\r\nprovisions were made, says Diodorus, in the full conviction that few\r\npersons were capable of introducing any new treatment superior to that\r\nwhich had been sanctioned and approved by old practitioners.\r\n\r\nPliny complains that no such laws existed in Rome, where a physician was\r\nthe only man who could commit murder with impunity; \"Nulla praeterea lex,\"\r\nhe says, \"quae puniat inscitium capitalem, nullum exemplum vindictae.\r\nDiscunt periculis nostris, et experimenta per mortes agunt: medicoque\r\ntantum hominem occidisse impunitas summa est.\"\r\n\r\nBy one of these singular anomalies in public opinion, this supposed divine\r\nscience was soon considered an ignoble profession. In Rome it was chiefly\r\npractised by slaves, freedmen, or foreigners. From the overthrow of the\r\nRoman empire till the revival of literature and the arts in Europe,\r\nmedicine and surgery sought a refuge amongst the Arabians, who studied\r\nboth branches in common; for, though exiled to the coast of Africa in\r\npoint of scientific cultivation, it was necessarily cultivated in other\r\ncountries, and in the greater part of Europe became the exclusive right of\r\necclesiastics. In time, however, it was gradually wrested from their hands\r\nby daily necessities; and every one, even amongst the lowest classes,\r\nprofessed himself a surgeon, and the cure of the hurt and the lame was\r\nintrusted to menials and women.\r\n\r\nAs the church could no longer monopolize the art of healing, it became\r\nexpedient to stigmatize it, although that very faculty had but lately been\r\ntheir boast; but it had fallen within the powers of vulgar and profane\r\ncomprehension, and therefore was useless to maintain sacerdotal\r\npre-eminence. In 1163, the Council of Tours, held by Pope Alexander III.,\r\nmaintained that the devil, to seduce the priesthood from the duties of the\r\naltar, involved them in mundane occupations, which, under the plea of\r\nhumanity, exposed them to constant and perilous temptations. The edict not\r\nonly prohibited the study both of medicine and law amongst all that had\r\ntaken religious vows, but actually excommunicated every ecclesiastic who\r\nmight infringe the decree. It appears, however, that the temptations of\r\nthe evil one were still attractive, as Pope Honorius III., in 1215, was\r\nobliged to fulminate a fresh anathema on transgressors, with an additional\r\ncanon, ordaining that, as the church abhorred all cruel or sanguinary\r\npractices, not only no priest should be allowed the practice of surgery,\r\nbut should refuse their benediction to all who professed it.[26]\r\n\r\nThe practice then fell into the hands of laymen, although priests, still\r\nregretting the advantages that it formerly had yielded them, were\r\nconsulted in their convents or houses; and when patients could not visit\r\nthem without exposing them to clerical censure, they asserted their\r\nability to cure diseases by the mere inspection of the patient's\r\ndejections; and so much faith was reposed in this filthy practice, that\r\nHenry II. decreed that upon the complaints of the heirs of persons who\r\ndied through the fault of their physicians, the latter should suffer\r\ncapital punishment, as having been the cause of their patient's death,\r\nunless they had scientifically examined what was submitted to their\r\ninvestigation by the deceased's relatives or domestics: and then proceeded\r\nto prescribe for the malady.\r\n\r\nUnable to quit their cloisters, in surgical cases, which could not be so\r\neasily cured at a distance, sooner than lose the emoluments of the\r\nprofession, they sent their servants, or rather the barbers of the\r\ncommunity, who shaved, and bled, and drew teeth in their neighbourhood\r\never since the clergy could no longer perform these operations, on the\r\nplea of the maxim \"_Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine_;\" bleeding and\r\ntooth-drawing being, I believe, the only cases where this maxim was\r\nnoticed. From this circumstance arose the barber craft or barber-surgeons.\r\n\r\nThese practitioners, from their various avocations, were necessarily\r\ndexterous; for, in addition to the skill required for good shaving,\r\ntonsurating the crowns of clerical heads was a delicate operation; and it\r\nwas about this period that Pope Alexander III. revised the canon issued by\r\nthe synod of Carthage respecting the tonsure of the clergy. Surgery being\r\nthus degraded, the separation between its practice and that of medicine\r\nbecame unavoidable, and the two branches were formally made distinct by\r\nbulls of Boniface VI. and Clement V.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis, who had witnessed the services of surgeons in the field of\r\nbattle during the crusades, had formed a college or _confrerie_ of\r\nsurgeons, in honour of St. Cosme and St. Damian, in 1268; and wounds and\r\nsores were dressed _gratis_ in the churches dedicated to those saints on\r\nthe first Monday of every month. To this body, of course, the\r\nbarber-surgeons, or _fraters_ of the priests, who had not received any\r\nregular education, did not belong. Hence arose the distinction, which even\r\nto the present day obtains in various parts of the Continent, where\r\nsurgeons are divided into two classes,--those who had gone through a\r\nregular course of studies, and those who, without any academical\r\neducation, were originally employed as the servants of the priests and\r\nbarbers. So late as the year 1809, one of my assistants in the Portuguese\r\narmy felt much hurt at my declining his offer to shave me; and in 1801,\r\nsome British assistant-surgeons, who had entered the Swedish navy, were\r\nordered to shave the ship's company, and were dismissed the service in\r\nconsequence of their refusal to comply with this command.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our barbers.--These ambitious shavers gradually attempted\r\nto glean in the footsteps of the regular chirurgeons, and even to encroach\r\nupon their domain, by performing more important operations than phlebotomy\r\nand tooth-drawing; the audacious intruders were therefore very properly\r\nbrought up _ex officio_ by the attorney-general of France, and forbidden\r\nto transgress the boundaries of their art, until they had been duly\r\nexamined by master chirurgeons; although these said masters were not\r\nbetter qualified than many of the barbers. Such was their ignorance\r\nindeed, that Pitard, an able practitioner, who had successively been the\r\nsurgeon of St. Louis, Philip the Brave, and Philip the Fair, obtained a\r\nprivilege to examine and grant licences to such of these masters who were\r\nfit to practise, without which licence all practitioners were liable to be\r\npunished by the provost of Paris; and in 1372 barbers were only allowed to\r\ndress boils, bruises, and open wounds.\r\n\r\nAlthough this account chiefly refers to France and its capital, yet the\r\nsame distinction and division between surgeons and barbers prevailed in\r\nalmost every other country; and privileges were maintained with as much\r\nvirulence and absurdity as the present controversial bickerings between\r\nphysicians and surgeons.\r\n\r\nIn 1355 these master-surgeons constituted a faculty, which pocketed\r\none-half of the penalties imposed upon the unlucky wights who had not the\r\nhonour of belonging to their body. They also enjoyed various immunities\r\nand exemptions; amongst others, that of not keeping guard and watch in the\r\ncity of Paris. To increase their emoluments, they granted as many honorary\r\ndistinctions as they could in decency devise, and introduced the\r\ncategories of bachelors, licentiates, masters, graduates, and\r\nnon-graduates of surgery. The medical faculty now began to complain of the\r\nencroachments of the master-surgeons on their internal domain of poor\r\nmortality with as much bitterness as the masters complained of the\r\nimpertinent invasion on the part of the barbers, of their external\r\ndominion. To court the powerful protection of the university against these\r\ninterlopers, the surgeons consented to be considered as the scholars of\r\nthe medical faculty, chiefly governed by clerical physicians.\r\n\r\nIn 1452 a fresh source of dissension arose amongst clerical physicians,\r\nlay physicians, master surgeons, and barbers. Cardinal Etoutville\r\nabolished the law which bound the physicians of the university to\r\ncelibacy, when, to use the historian's words, \"many of the clerical\r\nphysicians, thinking there was more comfort to be found in a wife without\r\na benefice than could be expected in a benefice without a wife, abandoned\r\nthe priesthood, and were then permitted to visit their patients at their\r\nown houses.\" Thus thrown into the uncontrolled practice of medicine, these\r\nphysicians became jealous of the influence of the surgeons, to whom they\r\nhad been so much indebted; and they had recourse to every art and\r\nmanoeuvre that priestcraft could devise to oppress and degrade them. To\r\naid this purpose, they resorted to the barbers, whom they instructed in\r\nprivate, to enable them to oppose the master-surgeons more effectually.\r\nThe surgeons, indignant at this protection, had recourse to the medical\r\nfaculty, supplicating them to have the barbers shorn of their rising\r\ndignity. Thus for mere motives of pecuniary interest, and the evident\r\ndetriment of society, did these intriguing practitioners struggle for\r\npower and consequent fees; and, according to the vacillation of their\r\ninterests, the barbers became alternately the allies of the physicians or\r\nthe mercenary skirmishers of the surgeons.\r\n\r\nFrom this oppression of the art, for nearly three centuries surgery was\r\nconsidered a degrading profession. Excluded from the university, not only\r\nwere surgeons deprived of all academic honours and privileges, but\r\nsubjected to those taxes and public burdens from which the members of the\r\nuniversity, being of the clerical order, were exempted. This persecution\r\nnot only strove to injure them in a worldly point of view, but the priests\r\ncarried their vindictive feelings to such a point of malignity that when\r\nCharles IX. was about to confer the rites of apostolical benediction upon\r\nthe surgeons of the long robe, the medical faculty interposed on the plea\r\nof their not being qualified to receive this benediction, as they did not\r\nbelong to any of the four faculties of the university; and as the\r\nchancellor, or any other man, had not the power of conferring a blessing\r\nwithout the pope's permission and special mandate, both surgeons and\r\nbarbers ought to be irrevocably damned. The apostolical benediction in\r\nthose days was considered of great value, since it exempted all candidates\r\nfrom examination in anatomy, medicine, surgery, or any other\r\nqualification, when they applied for a degree.\r\n\r\nEver since the healing art ceased to be a clerical privilege, and a state\r\nof rivalry prevailed between spiritual and corporeal doctors, the former\r\nhave sought to represent their opponents as infidels and atheists--the\r\nunbelief of physicians became prevalent, and to this day medical men are\r\ngenerally considered freethinkers;--an appellation which in a strictly\r\ncorrect acceptation might be considered more complimentary than\r\nopprobrious, since it designates a man, who extricating his intellectual\r\nfaculties from the meshes of ignorance or prejudices, takes the liberty of\r\nthinking for himself.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Brown in his \"Religio Medici,\" alludes to this injurious\r\nopinion entertained of medical men, when he says, \"For my religion, though\r\nthere be several circumstances that might persuade the world I have none\r\nat all, _as the general scandal of my profession_, the natural course of\r\nmy studies, the indifferency of my behaviour and discourse in matters of\r\nreligion--yet in despite thereof, I dare, without usurpation, assume the\r\nhonourable style of Christian.\"\r\n\r\nSir Kenelm Digby in his observations on the work from which the above is\r\nextracted, entertains a similar opinion, and quotes Friar Bacon in support\r\nof it. The following are his words: \"Those students who busy themselves\r\nmuch with such notions as reside wholly in the fantasy, do hardly ever\r\nbecome idoneous for abstracted metaphysical speculations; the one having\r\nbulky foundations of matter, or of the accidents of it, to settle upon--at\r\nthe least with one foot; the other flying continually, even to a lessening\r\npitch in the subtile air. And accordingly it hath been generally noted,\r\nthat the excellent mathematicians, who converse altogether with lines,\r\nfigures, and other differences of quantity, have seldom proved eminent in\r\nmetaphysics or speculative divinity. Nor again, the profession of their\r\nsciences in other arts, much less can it be expected that an excellent\r\nphysician, whose fancy is always fraught with the material drugs that he\r\nprescribeth his apothecary to compound his medicines of, and whose hands\r\nare inured to the cutting up, and eyes to the inspection of anatomized\r\nbodies, should easily and with success ply his thoughts at so towering a\r\ngame, as a pure intellect, or separated and unbodied soul.\"\r\n\r\nThat such ideas should be maintained in former days, when bigotry and\r\nprejudice reigned paramount, we cannot be surprised; but one must marvel\r\nto see a modern and intelligent annotator of Brown's work,[27] coincide in\r\nthis illiberal opinion, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n\"Imaginative men, that is, persons in whom the higher attributes of genius\r\nare found, seldom delight in the sciences conversant with mere matter or\r\nform; least of all in medicine, the object of which is the derangement, or\r\nimperfection of nature, and the endeavour to substitute order and harmony\r\nin the place of their opposites. Brought thus chiefly into contact with\r\ndiseased organization, surrounded by the worst elements of civil society,\r\n(for their experience must in general be among the intemperate and the\r\nvicious,) they may be said to exist in an infected moral atmosphere, and\r\nit is therefore not greatly to be wondered at that among such persons a\r\nhighly religious frame of mind should be the exception and not the rule.\"\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of this observation can only be equalled by its extreme\r\nilliberality. Can it be for one moment entertained, that the physician who\r\ngives his care to every class of society and at all ages \"exists in an\r\ninfected moral atmosphere?\" Supposing that he is not fortunate enough to\r\nattend upon the opulent and the great, and is limited to a pauper or an\r\nhospital practice, does Mr. St. John mean to say that instances of\r\nintemperance and vice are confined to the indigent, although want of\r\neducation, and poverty may degrade them in crapulous pursuits? If there\r\ndoes exist a profession pre-eminent for its philanthropic character, and\r\nthe power of discrimination between good and evil, and right and wrong, it\r\nis undoubtedly that of medicine. The finest feelings of humanity are\r\nconstantly brought to bear, both in seeking to relieve bodily sufferings\r\nand solacing an afflicted mind--whether it be with the scalpel in hand in\r\nan anatomical theatre, or by the bedside of an agonized sufferer, whom he\r\nhopes, under Providence, to restore to health and to his family, the\r\nphysician has daily opportunities of beholding the wonders of the creation\r\nand the benevolence of the Creator--he is a constant witness of the\r\nfervent supplication of the unfortunate and the heartfelt gratitude of\r\nthose suppliants at the throne of mercy, whose prayers have been heard. A\r\nman of exalted benevolence (and such a physician ought to be), he must be\r\nalive to all the generous feelings of humanity, and he is doomed more\r\nfrequently to move in an _infected moral atmosphere_, when gratuitously\r\nattending some of the troublesome and pedantic legislators of the republic\r\nof letters, than when exerting his skill to relieve the grateful poor who\r\nmay fall under his care.\r\n\r\nIt has been maintained that the physician seeking in the arcana of nature\r\nthe causes of every vital phenomenon becomes a materialist: nothing can be\r\nmore unjust, nay, more absurd, than such a supposition. The study of\r\nphysiology teaches us, more perhaps then any other pursuit, to admire the\r\nwonderful works of our Creator, and Voltaire has beautifully illustrated\r\nthe fact in the following lines:\r\n\r\n  Demandez a Sylva par quel secret mystere\r\n  Ce pain, cet aliment dans mon corps digere,\r\n  Se transforme en un lait doucement prepare;\r\n  Comment, toujours filtre dans des routes certaines,\r\n  En longs ruisseaux de pourpre il court enfler mes veines;\r\n  A mon corps languissant donne un pouvoir nouveau,\r\n  Fait palpiter mon coeur et penser mon cerveau;\r\n  Il leve au ciel les yeux, il s'incline, il s'ecrie\r\n  Demandez le a CE DIEU qui m'a donnez la vie.\r\n\r\nBroeseche has justly said, _Tanta est inter deum, religionem, et medicum\r\nconnexio, ut sine Deo et religione nullus exactus medicus esse queat_; and\r\nit has truly been said by a later writer, \"that a philosophic physician\r\nmust seek in religion, strength of mind to support the painful exertions\r\nof his profession, and some consolation for the ingratitude of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the many glaring absurdities which retarded the progress of\r\nmedical studies, one cannot but notice the presumptuous claims of the\r\nphysicians to the exclusive privilege of teaching surgery to their pupils,\r\nwhile anatomy was solely professed by surgeons, and not considered\r\nnecessary in the instruction of a physician. All these anomalies can be\r\neasily traced to that spirit of dominion, exclusion, and monopoly, which\r\ninvariably characterized clerical bodies. To such a pitch was this\r\ndestructive practice carried, that surgeons were only allowed to perform\r\noperations in the presence of one or more physicians: nor were they\r\npermitted to publish any work on their profession until it had been\r\nlicensed by a faculty who were utterly ignorant of the matter of which it\r\ntreated. The celebrated Ambrose Pare could only obtain as a special favour\r\nfrom his sovereign, the permission to give to the world one of its most\r\nvaluable sources of information.\r\n\r\nSo late as 1726 we find the medical faculty of Paris making a formal\r\nrepresentation to Cardinal de Noailles and the curates of that capital to\r\nprevent surgeons from granting certificates of health or of disease, and\r\nthis application was grounded on the pious motive of enforcing a more\r\nrigid observance of Lent! They further insisted that this indispensable\r\nmortification was eluded in consequence of the facility of obtaining\r\ncertificates that permitted persons stated to be indisposed to eat animal\r\nfood, eggs, and butter, whence infidelity was making a most alarming\r\nprogress, threatening the very existence of church and state, and the\r\noverthrow of every ancient and glorious institution. The faculty were\r\nformally thanked for their pious zeal in the true interests of religion,\r\nand the spiritual welfare of their patients; and orders were affixed upon\r\nthe door of every church, anathematizing all certificates that emanated\r\nfrom the unholy hands of surgeons and barbers.\r\n\r\nThese unfortunate barbers, although they humbly submitted to the sway of\r\nboth physicians and surgeons when it suited their purpose, were in turn\r\npersecuted by both their allies and alternate protectors; so much so, that\r\nthe clerical practitioners at one time prohibited them from bleeding, and\r\nconferred this privilege upon the bagnio-keepers. From the well-known\r\nnature of these establishments, various may be the reasons that led to\r\nthis patronage, which was clearly an attempt to qualify bagnio-keepers to\r\nextend their convenient trade.\r\n\r\nAt last, in the year 1505, barbers were dignified with the name of\r\nsurgeons. Their instructions were delivered in their vernacular tongue,\r\nuntil the university again interfered, and ordered that lectures should be\r\ndelivered in Latin; once more closing alma-mater against illiterate\r\nshavers, who were, however, obliged to give a smattering of classical\r\neducation to their sons destined to wield alternately the razor and the\r\nlancet. In 1655, surgeons and barber-surgeons were incorporated in one\r\ncollege; a union which was further confirmed, in 1660, by royal\r\nordonnance, under some limitations, whereby the barbers should not assume\r\nthe title of licentiates, bachelors, or professors, nor be allowed to wear\r\nthe honourable gown and cap that distinguished the higher grades of\r\nlearning. Red caps were in former times given by each barber to his\r\nteacher on his being qualified, and gloves to all his fellow-students.\r\n\r\nThus we find that the high state of perfection which the surgical art has\r\nattained is solely due to the efforts of industry to free itself from the\r\nignoble trammels of bigotry and prejudice. Intellectual progress has\r\ninvariably been opposed in every country by those powerful and interested\r\nindividuals who derived their wealth and influence from the ignorance of\r\nsociety. Corporate bodies monopolizing the exercise of any profession will\r\ninvariably retard instruction and shackle the energies of the student. It\r\nis, no doubt, indispensable that the practice of medicine in all its\r\nbranches should only be allowed to such persons as are duly qualified; but\r\nwhenever pecuniary advantages are derived from the grant of the\r\npermission, abuses as dishonourable as they are injurious to society will\r\ninfallibly prevail. In Great Britain the period of study required in\r\nmedical candidates is by no means sufficient. Five or six years is the\r\nvery lowest period that should be insisted on; and, when duly instructed,\r\ndegrees and licences should be conferred without fee, on all applicants,\r\nby a board of examiners unprejudiced and disinterested. This mode of\r\ngranting licences would add to the respectability of the profession, while\r\nit would ensure proper attendance to the public. Physicians and surgeons\r\nwould then become (what to a certain extent the latter are at present,\r\nthough illegally as far as the laws of the college go), general\r\npractitioners, and society would no longer be infested by the swarms of\r\npractising apothecaries, who, from the very nature of their education, can\r\nonly be skilled in making up medicines, or who must have obtained\r\nexperience in the lessons taught by repeated failures in their early\r\npractice, unless perchance they have stepped beyond the usual confined\r\ninstruction of their class. The consequences that arise from this fatal\r\nsystem are but too obvious. These men live by selling drugs, which they\r\nunmercifully supply, to the material injury of the patient's constitution.\r\nIf, after ringing all the changes of their materia medica without causing\r\nthe church-bell to toll, they find themselves puzzled and bewildered, a\r\nphysician or a surgeon is called in, and too frequently these\r\npractitioners are bound by tacit agreement not to diminish the revenue\r\nthat the shop produces. If it were necessary to prove the evils that\r\nresult from the monopolizing powers vested in corporate institutions, the\r\nproof might be sought and found in the virulence and jealousy which they\r\nevince in resisting reform, from whatever quarter it may be dreaded; and\r\nit may be said that too many of the practising apothecaries of the present\r\nday stand in the same relative situation in the medical profession as the\r\nbarbers of olden times.\r\n\r\nThis faculty of exercising every branch of the profession, however\r\nqualified, is of olden date, and we find on the subject the following\r\nlines in the writings of Alcuin in the time of Charlemagne:\r\n\r\n  Accurrunt medici mox Hippocratica tecta:\r\n  Hic venas findit, herbas hic miscet in olla;\r\n  Ille coquit pultes, alter sed pocula perfert.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON DREAMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophical ingenuity has long been displayed in the most learned\r\ndisquisitions in an endeavour to account for the nature of these\r\nphenomena. The strangeness of these visionary perturbations of our\r\nrest--their supposed influence on our destinies--their frequent\r\nverification by subsequent events--have always shed a mystic _prestige_\r\naround them; and superstition, ignorance, and craft, have in turns\r\ncharacterized them as the warnings of the Divine will, or the machinations\r\nof an evil spirit.\r\n\r\nMacrobius divided them into various categories. The first, the mere\r\n_dream_, _somnium_, he considers a figurative and mysterious\r\nrepresentation that requires to be interpreted. Dion Cassius gives an\r\nexample of this in the case of Nero, who dreamt that he saw the chair of\r\nJupiter pass into the palace of Vespasian, which was considered as\r\nemblematical of his translation to the empire.\r\n\r\nThe second distinction he terms a _vision_, _visio_, or a foreboding of\r\nfuture events. The third he deemed _oracular_, _oraculum_, and this was\r\nthe case when a priest, or a relative, a deity, a hero, or some venerable\r\nperson, denounced what was to happen, or warned us against it. As an\r\nexample of this inspiration, for such it was considered, an anecdote of\r\nVespasian is related. Having heard that a man in Achaia had dreamt that a\r\nperson unknown to him had assured him that he should date his prosperity\r\nfrom the moment that Nero should lose a tooth,--a tooth just drawn from\r\nthat emperor being shown to him the following day, he foresaw his\r\ndestinies: soon after Nero died, Galba did not long survive him, and the\r\ndiscord that reigned between Otho and Vitellius ultimately placed the\r\ndiadem on his brow. These inspirations were considered by Cicero, and\r\nvarious philosophers, as particularly appertaining to the shrine of the\r\ngods; those who sought that heavenly admonition were therefore recommended\r\nto lie down in temples. The Lacedaemonians sought slumber in the temple of\r\nPasithea; Brizo, the goddess of sleep and dreams, was worshipped at Delos,\r\nand her votaries slept before her altars with their heads bound with\r\nlaurel, and other fatidical symbols; hence divination by dreams was called\r\n_Brizomantia_. Supplications were offered up to Mercury for propitious\r\nvisions, and a caduceus was placed for that purpose at the feet of beds;\r\nhence was it called [Greek: ermies].\r\n\r\nDiodorus informs us that dreams were regarded in Egypt with religious\r\nreverence, and the prayers of the devout were often rewarded by the gods\r\nwith an indication of appropriate remedies. But the confidence in\r\nsupernatural agency and the power of magic, was only deemed a last\r\nresource, when human skill had been baffled. Some persons promised a\r\ncertain sum of money for the maintenance of sacred animals, consecrated to\r\nthe divinity whose aid they implored. In the case of infants, a certain\r\nportion of their hair was cut off and weighed, and when the cure was\r\neffected an equal quantity of gold was given to the successful\r\nintermediator.\r\n\r\nThe fourth division was _insomny_, _insomnium_, which was characterized by\r\na disturbed repose, caused either by mental or bodily oppression, or\r\nsolicitude. The fifth class of dreams was the _phantasm_ or _visus_, which\r\ntakes place between sleeping and waking, in a dozing and broken slumber,\r\nwhen the person thinks himself awake, and yet beholds fantastic and\r\nchimerical figures floating around his couch. Under this class is placed\r\nthe _ephialtes_, or night-mare. Macrobius represents the phantasm and the\r\ninsomnium as little deserving of attention, being of no use in divination\r\nand prediction.\r\n\r\nWhen these notions prevailed, the interpretation of dreams became a\r\nprofitable trade; and it is a lamentable truth, that, to the present day,\r\nit is considered a speculation upon credulity. We find in Plutarch's Life\r\nof Aristides that there were tables drawn out for this purpose; and he\r\nspeaks of one Lysimachus, a grandson of Aristides, who gained a handsome\r\nlivelihood by this profession, taking up his station near the temple of\r\nBacchus. Rules of interpretation were formed by Artemidorus, who lived in\r\nthe reign of Antoninus Pius, and he drew his conclusions from\r\ncircumstances considered either propitious or sinister. Thus, to dream of\r\na large nose, signified subtlety; of rosemary or sage, trouble and\r\nweakness; of a midwife, disclosure of secrets; of a leopard, a deceitful\r\nperson. These interpretations became so multiplied, that at last it was\r\ndecreed that no dreams which related to the public weal should be\r\nregarded, unless they had visited the brains of some magistrates, or more\r\nthan one individual. But what limits can any enactment assign to the\r\ninfluence of credulity and superstition? Cicero informs us that the Consul\r\nLucius Julius repaired to the temple of Juno Sospita, in obedience to a\r\ndecree of the senate regarding the dream of Caecilia, daughter of\r\nBalearicus.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times we have often seen dreams resorted to, in order to\r\nassist the speculations of policy and priestcraft; some of them as absurd\r\nin their nature as revolting in their interpretation. Monkish records\r\nrelate that St. Bernard's mother dreamed that she had a little white dog\r\nbarking about her, which was interpreted to her by a religious person as\r\nmeaning \"that she should be the mother of an excellent dog indeed, who\r\nshould be the hope of God's house, and would incessantly bark against its\r\nadversaries, for he should be a famous preacher, and cure many by his\r\nmedicinal tongue.\" Our Archbishop Laurence, to whom we owe the church of\r\nOur Lady at Canterbury, was about to emigrate to France under the\r\ndiscouragement of persecution, until warned in a dream, and severely\r\nscourged by St. Peter for his weakness. It was on the relation not only of\r\nthis dream, but on actually exhibiting the marks of the stripes he had\r\nreceived, that Eadbald was baptized, and became a protector of the church.\r\nIt was in a dream of this description that St. Andrew instructed Peter\r\nPontanus how to find out the spear that had pierced our Saviour's side,\r\nand which was hidden somewhere near Antioch. Antioch was at that time\r\nbesieged by the Persians, and half famished; but this weapon being carried\r\nby a bishop, enabled the besieged to beleaguer Caiban, the Persian\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nThe Peripatetics represented dreams as arising from a presaging faculty of\r\nthe mind; other sects imagined that they were suggestions of daemons.\r\nDemocritus and Lucretius looked upon them as spectres and _simulacra_ of\r\ncorporeal things, emitted from them, floating in the air, and assailing\r\nthe soul. A modern writer, Andrew Baxter, entertained a notion somewhat\r\nsimilar, and imagined that dreams were prompted by separate immaterial\r\nbeings, or spirits, who had access to the sleeper's brain with the faculty\r\nof inspiring him with various ideas. Burton divides dreams into natural,\r\ndivine, and daemoniacal; and he defines sleep, after Scaliger, as \"the rest\r\nor binding of the outward senses, and of the common sense, for the\r\npreservation of body and soul.\"\r\n\r\nGradually released from the trammels of superstition, modern philosophers\r\nhave sought for more plausible explanations of the nature and causes of\r\ndreams, but perhaps without having attained a greater degree of certainty\r\nin this difficult question than our bewildered ancestors. Wolfius is of\r\nopinion that every dream originates in some sensation, yet the independent\r\nenergies of the mind are sufficiently displayed in the preservation of the\r\ncontinued phantasms of the imagination. He maintains that none of these\r\nphantasms can prevail unless they arise from this previous sensation. De\r\nFormey is of the same opinion, and conceives that dreams are supernatural\r\nwhen not produced by these sensations. But of what nature are these\r\nsensations? Are they corporeal impressions received prior to sleep, and\r\nthe continuances of reflection, or are they the children of an idle brain?\r\nAlthough it is not easy to trace an affinity between the subjects of our\r\ndreams and our previous train of thought, yet it is more than probable\r\nthat dreams are excited by impressions experienced in our waking moments,\r\nand retransmitted to the sensorium, however difficult it may be to link\r\nthe connexion of our ideas, and trace their imperceptible catenation.\r\nMoreover, there does not exist a necessary and regular association in the\r\nstate of mind that succeeds any particular impressions. These impressions\r\nonly predispose the mind to certain ideas, which act upon it with more or\r\nless subsequent energy, and with more or less irregularity, according to\r\nthe condition in which the predisposing causes have left it. It has been\r\nobserved that we seldom dream of the objects of our love or our\r\nantipathies. Such dreams may not be the natural results of such\r\nsentiments. We may fondly love a woman, and in our dreams transfer this\r\nsoft sensation of fondness to another individual,--to a dog that fondles\r\nus, or any other pleasing object. We may have experienced fear--in a storm\r\nat sea; yet we may not dream of being tossed about in a boat, but of being\r\nmounted upon a runaway horse who hurries us to destruction, or of flying\r\nfrom a falling avalanche. Our mind had been predisposed by fear to receive\r\nany terrific impression, and most probably these alarming phantasms will\r\nbe of a chimerical and an extravagant nature. A man who has been bitten by\r\na dog may fancy himself in the coils of a boa-constrictor. When dreaming,\r\nthe mind is in an abstracted state; but still is its reciprocal influence\r\nover the body manifest, although it is powerless on volition. Vigilance in\r\nsleep is still awake; but her assistance is of no avail until the\r\nconnexion between mind and body is aroused by any alarm from external\r\nagents. It is well known that a hungry man will dream of an ample repast.\r\nA patient with a blister on his head has fancied himself scalped by\r\nIndians in all their fantastic ornaments. Somnambulism clearly proves that\r\nthe mind retains its energies in sleep. Locke has justly observed that\r\ndreams are made up of the waking man's ideas, although oddly put together.\r\nHartley is of opinion that dreams are nothing but the reveries of sleeping\r\nmen, and are deducible from the impressions and ideas lately received, the\r\nstate of the body, and association. I have endeavoured to explain, on the\r\nground of the general effects of predisposition, the anomalies which so\r\noften are displayed in these associations. Of the surprising powers of the\r\nmind in somnambulism we have many instances too well authenticated to be\r\ndoubted. Henricus ab Heeres was in the habit of composing in his sleep,\r\nreading aloud his productions, expressing his satisfaction, and calling to\r\nhis chamber-fellow to join in the commendation. Caelius Rhodiginus when\r\nbusied in his interpretation of Pliny, could only find the proper\r\nsignification of the word _ectrapali_ in his slumbers. There is not the\r\nleast doubt but that the mind is capable of receiving impressions of\r\nknowledge, but more particularly inspirations of genius, when the body is\r\nlulled in a state of apparent repose. Dreams have been ingeniously\r\ncompared to a drama defective in the laws of unity, and unconnected by\r\nconstant anachronisms. Yet certain incoherences are not frequent: Darwin\r\nhas justly remarked that a woman will seldom dream that she is a soldier,\r\nand a soldier's visions will seldom expose him to the apprehensions of\r\nchild-birth. Buffon has observed, \"We represent to ourselves persons whom\r\nwe have never seen, and such as have been dead for many years; we behold\r\nthem alive and such as they were, but we associate them with actual\r\nthings, or with persons of other times. It is the same with our ideas of\r\nlocality; we see things not where they were, but elsewhere, where they\r\nnever could have been.\"\r\n\r\nDugald Stewart has endeavoured to account for these phenomena by the\r\ndoctrine that in sleep the operations of the mind are suspended, and that\r\ntherefore the cause of dreams is the loss of power of the will over the\r\nmind, which in the waking condition is subject to its control. Now, if\r\nthis be the case, dreams must consist of mental operations independent of\r\nthe will. However, it is not the suspension of the will and of the powers\r\nof volition that alone constitutes sleep; it is the suspension of the\r\npowers of the understanding,--attention, comparison, memory, and judgment.\r\nIt is in consequence of this suspension of all our active intellectual\r\nfaculties that we never can _will_ during our dreams; in that state there\r\nappears to be a resistance of the powers of volition with which the mind\r\nstruggles in vain, and which is expressed both by moans, and the character\r\nof the sleeper's every feature, which portrays a state of anguish and\r\nimpatience. In all dreams that are not of a morbid nature, every action is\r\npassive, involuntary. This state is widely different from delirium, in\r\nwhich the brain is in a morbid state of excitement; and the body is more\r\nsusceptible than usual of external agency, while the mind is perplexed by\r\nhallucinations of an erroneous nature.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie considers insanity and dreaming as having a remarkable\r\naffinity when considered as mental phenomena; the impressions in the one\r\ncase being more or less permanent, and transient in the other.\r\nSomnambulism he considers an intermediate state. Dreams, according to his\r\ntheory, are divided into four classes: the first, when recent events and\r\nrecent mental emotions are mixed up with each other, and with old events,\r\nby some feeling common to both; the second class relates to trains of\r\nimages brought up by association with bodily sensations; the third, the\r\nresult of forgotten associations; and the fourth class of dreams contains\r\nthose in which a strong propensity of character, or a strong mental\r\nemotion, is imbodied in a dream, and by some natural coincidence is\r\nfulfilled. The following interesting cases that fell under Dr.\r\nAbercrombie's immediate notice, illustrate his views and the above\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nRegarding the first class, Dr. A. relates the following: \"A woman, who was\r\na patient in the clinical ward of the infirmary of Edinburgh, under the\r\ncare of Dr. Duncan, talked a great deal in her sleep, and made numerous\r\nand very distinct allusions to the cases of other sick persons. These\r\nallusions did not apply to any patients who were in the ward at the time;\r\nbut, after some observation, they were found to refer correctly to the\r\ncases of individuals who were there when this woman was a patient in the\r\nward two years before.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is an instance of phantasms being produced by our\r\nassociations with bodily sensations, and tends to show how alive our\r\nfaculties continue during sleep to the slightest impressions:\r\n\r\nThe subject of this observation was an officer in the expedition to\r\nLouisburg in 1758, who had this peculiarity in so remarkable a degree,\r\nthat his companions in the transport were in the constant habit of amusing\r\nthemselves at his expense. They could produce in him any kind of dream by\r\nwhispering in his ear, especially if this was done by a friend with whose\r\nvoice he had become familiar. One time they conducted him through the\r\nwhole progress of a quarrel, which ended in a duel; and when the parties\r\nwere supposed to have met, a pistol was put into his hand, which he fired,\r\nand was awakened by the report. On another occasion they found him asleep\r\non the top of a locker in the cabin, when they made him believe he had\r\nfallen overboard, and exhorted him to save himself by swimming. They then\r\ntold him that a shark was pursuing him, and entreated him to dive for his\r\nlife. He instantly did so, and with so much force as to throw himself from\r\nthe locker upon the cabin floor, by which he was much bruised, and\r\nawakened of course. After the landing of the army at Louisburg, his\r\nfriends found him one day asleep in his tent, and evidently much annoyed\r\nby the cannonading. They then made him believe that he was engaged, when\r\nhe expressed great fear, and showed an evident disposition to run away.\r\nAgainst this they remonstrated, but at the same time increased his fears\r\nby imitating the groans of the wounded and the dying; and when he asked,\r\nas he often did, who was hit, they named his particular friends. At last\r\nthey told him that the man next himself in his company had fallen, when he\r\ninstantly sprung from his bed, rushed out of the tent, and was only roused\r\nfrom his danger and his dream by falling over the tent-ropes. A\r\nremarkable thing in this case was, that after these experiments he had no\r\ndistinct recollection of his dreams, but only a confused feeling of\r\noppression or fatigue, and used to tell his friends that he was sure they\r\nhad been playing some trick upon him. It has been observed that we seldom\r\nfeel courageous or daring in our dreams, and generally avoid danger when\r\nmenaced by a foe, or exposed to any probable peril.\r\n\r\nThe third class of dreams relates to the revival of forgotten\r\nassociations. The person in question was at the time connected with one of\r\nthe principal banks in Glasgow, and was at his place at the teller's\r\ntable, where money is paid, when a person entered demanding payment of a\r\nsum of six pounds. There were several people waiting, who were in turn\r\nentitled to be attended to before him; but he was remarkably impatient and\r\nrather noisy, and being besides a remarkable stammerer, he became so\r\nannoying, that another gentleman requested him to pay the money and get\r\nrid of him. He did so accordingly, but with an expression of impatience at\r\nbeing obliged to attend to him before his turn, and thought no more of the\r\ntransaction. At the end of the year, which was eight or nine months after,\r\nthe books of the bank could not be made to balance, the deficiency being\r\nexactly six pounds. Several days and nights had been spent in endeavouring\r\nto discover the error, but without success, when he returned home much\r\nfatigued, and went to bed. He dreamt of being at his place in the bank,\r\nand the whole transaction of the stammerer, as now detailed, passed before\r\nhim in all its particulars. He awoke under the full impression that the\r\ndream would lead him to the discovery of what he was so anxiously in\r\nsearch of, and on examination he soon discovered that he had neglected to\r\nenter the sum which he had thus paid.\r\n\r\nThe following singular dreams are examples of the fourth class. A\r\nclergyman had come to Edinburgh from a short distance in the country, and\r\nwas sleeping at an inn, when he dreamt of seeing a fire, and one of his\r\nchildren in the midst of it. He awoke with the impression, and instantly\r\nleft town on his return home. When he arrived in sight of his house, he\r\nfound it on fire, and got there in time to assist in saving one of his\r\nchildren, who in the alarm and confusion had been left in a situation of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nA gentleman in Edinburgh was affected with aneurism of the popliteal\r\nartery, for which he was under the care of two eminent surgeons, and the\r\nday was fixed for the operation. About two days before the appointed time,\r\nthe wife of the patient dreamt that a favourable change had taken place\r\nin the disease, in consequence of which the operation would not be\r\nrequired. On examining the tumour in the morning, the gentleman was\r\nastonished to find that the pulsation had entirely ceased, and, in short,\r\nthis turned out to be a spontaneous cure,--a very rare occurrence in\r\nsurgical practice.\r\n\r\nThe following dream is still more remarkable. A lady dreamt that an aged\r\nfemale relative had been murdered by a black servant, and the dream\r\noccurred more than once. She was then so impressed by it, that she went to\r\nthe house of the lady, and prevailed upon a gentleman to watch in an\r\nadjoining room during the following night. About three o'clock in the\r\nmorning, the gentleman, hearing footsteps on the stairs, left his place of\r\nconcealment, and met the servant carrying up a quantity of coals. Being\r\nquestioned as to where he was going, he replied, in a hurried and confused\r\nmanner, that he was going to mend his mistress's fire, which at three\r\no'clock in the morning in the middle of summer was evidently impossible;\r\nand, on further investigation, a strong knife was found concealed beneath\r\nthe coals.\r\n\r\nDreams, to whatever causes they may be attributed, vary according to the\r\nnature of our sleep: if it is sound and natural, they will seldom prevail;\r\nif, on the contrary, it be broken and uneasy, by a spontaneous association\r\ndreams will become fanciful, and might indeed be called visions, so\r\nfantastic and chimerical are all the objects that present themselves in\r\nmotley groups to the disturbed mind. This derangement in the sensorium may\r\nbe referred to various physical causes,--the sensations of heat or of\r\ncold, obstruction in the course of the circulation of the blood, as when\r\nlying upon the back, a difficult digestion. In a sound sleep our dreams\r\nare seldom remembered except in a vague manner; whereas, in a broken\r\nsleep, as Formey has observed, the impression of the dream remains upon\r\nthe mind, and constitutes what this philosopher called \"_the lucidity of\r\ndreams_.\" It not unfrequently happens to us that we have had a similar\r\ndream several times, or at least we labour under this impression; nay,\r\nmany persons fancy that particular events of their life at the moment of\r\ntheir occurrence had clearly taken place at a former period either in\r\nreality or in a dream. Morning \"winged dreams\" are more easily remembered\r\nin their circumstantial vagaries than those of the preceding night, for at\r\nthat period (the morning) our sleep is not sound, and dreams become more\r\nlucid. These _revasseries_, as the French call them, are admirably\r\ndescribed by Dryden:\r\n\r\n  A dream o'ertook me at my waking hour\r\n  This morn, and dreams they say are then divine,\r\n  When all the balmy vapours are exhal'd,\r\n  And some o'erpow'ring god continues sleep.\r\n\r\nThat we are more or less impressionable in our sleep is rendered evident\r\nby the facility with which even a sound sleeper is disturbed by the\r\nslightest noise: the sparkling of a fire, or the crackling produced by the\r\nwick of our night-lamp when coming into contact with the water in the\r\nglass, the sting of an insect, the slightest admission of a higher or\r\nlower temperature, will occasion a broken sleep and its dreams. It has\r\nbeen remarked that the sense of seeing is more frequently acted upon in\r\ndreams than that of hearing, and very seldom do we find our smell and\r\ntaste under their influence. It is possible that this peculiarity may\r\narise from the greater variety of impressions with which the sight is\r\ndaily struck, and which memory communicates by association or\r\nretransmission. Next to feeling, vision is the first sense brought into\r\nrelation with external objects. When we hear noises, explosions,\r\ntumultuous cries, it is more than probable that our dreams partake of a\r\ndelirious and morbid nature, or of sensorial or intellectual\r\nhallucinations, in which the mind is actually diseased, and our\r\nperceptions become erroneous: then we speak loudly to others, and to\r\nourselves. When these hallucinations prevail after sleep, the invasion of\r\nmania may be apprehended.\r\n\r\nCabanis, in his curious investigations on the mind, has endeavoured to fix\r\nthe order in which the different parts of our organization go to sleep.\r\nFirst the legs and arms, then the muscles that support the head and back:\r\nthe first sense that slumbers, according to his notions, is that of sight;\r\nthen follow in regular succession the senses of taste, smell, hearing, and\r\nfeeling. The viscera fall asleep one after the other, but with different\r\ndecrees of soundness. If this doctrine be correct, we may easily conceive\r\nthe wild and strange inconsistencies of our dreams, during which the\r\nwaking and the sleeping organs are acting and reacting upon each other.\r\n\r\nCorporeal sensations and different organic actions frequently attend our\r\ndreams; but these may be attributed to our mode of living, or the\r\nindulgence in certain unruly desires and conversations. That man and\r\nanimals dream of the pursuits of the preceding day there can be no doubt:\r\nhence the line,\r\n\r\n  Et canis in somnis leporis vestigia latrat.\r\n\r\nThe effects of a heavy meal, more especially a supper, in disturbing our\r\nrest, was well known and recorded by ancient physicians: and Crato tells\r\nus \"that the fittest time to repair to rest is two or three hours after\r\nsupper, when the meat is then settled in the bottom of the stomach: and\r\n'tis good to lie on the right side first, because at that side the liver\r\ndoth rest under the stomach, not molesting any way, but heating him as a\r\nfire doth a kettle that is put to it. After the first sleep 'tis not amiss\r\nto lie upon the left side, that the meat may the better descend; and\r\nsometimes again on the belly, but never on the back.\"\r\n\r\nOur ancestors had recourse to various devices to procure sound sleep.\r\nBorde recommends a good draught of strong drink before going to bed;\r\nBurton, a nutmeg and ale, with a good potation of muscadine with a toast;\r\nwhile Aetius recommends a sup of vinegar, which, according to Piso,\r\n\"_attenuat melancholiam et ad conciliandum somnum juvat_.\" Oppression from\r\nrepletion will occasion fearful dreams and the night-mare; and bodily\r\nsufferings, when exhaustion has brought on sleep, will also be attended\r\nwith alarming and painful visions.\r\n\r\nLevinus Lemnius recommended to sleep with the mouth shut, to promote a\r\nregular digestion by the exclusion of too much external air. The\r\nnight-mare is admirably described in Dryden's translation of Virgil:\r\n\r\n  And as, when heavy sleep has closed the sight,\r\n  The sickly fancy labours in the night,\r\n  We seem to run, and, destitute of force,\r\n  Our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:\r\n  In vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;\r\n  The nerves, unbraced, their usual strength deny,\r\n  And on the tongue the falt'ring accents die.\r\n\r\nIn the Runic theology it was regarded as a spectre of the night, which\r\nseized men in their sleep, and suddenly deprived them of speech and of\r\nmotion. It was vulgarly called witch-riding, and considered as arising\r\nfrom the weight of fuliginous spirits incumbent on the breast.\r\n\r\n_Somnus ut sit levis, sit tibi coena brevis_, is the ancient axiom of\r\nour distich,\r\n\r\n  That your sleep may be light,\r\n  Let your supper be slight.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this rule of health, it is nevertheless true that many\r\npersons sleep more soundly after a hearty supper; and, most\r\nunquestionably, dreams are more frequent towards morning than in the\r\nbeginning of the night. In my opinion, I should apprehend that the sound\r\nsleep of supper-eaters is to be attributed to the narcotic nature of their\r\npotations, more than the meal, although the _siesta_ of southern countries\r\nmight be advanced in favour of a contrary opinion.\r\n\r\nWhen philosophers speak of dreams being mental operations independent of\r\nthe will, they speak vaguely, for the operations of the mind when we are\r\nawake are too frequently uncontrolled by volition. Did we possess this\r\npower over our rebellious thoughts, who would constantly ponder on a\r\npainful subject? Our thoughts cannot be suspended at will, and their\r\ninfluence has been beautifully described by Shakspeare:\r\n\r\n  My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,\r\n  My soul the father; and these two beget\r\n  A generation of still breeding thoughts.\r\n\r\nVolition has no more power over thought when we are awake than sleeping;\r\nand, despite all metaphysical and psychological speculations, it cannot be\r\ndemonstrated that the mind does not retain its full energies during sleep,\r\nonly they cease to be regulated by judgment, and are not, to use Locke's\r\nwords, under the rule and conduct of the understanding; and even on this\r\nopinion it has been fairly observed, that much of incongruity which is\r\nsupposed to prove suspension of reason, and much of the wild discordancy\r\nof representation which appears to prevail during our sleep, may arise\r\nfrom the defect of memory when we are awake, that does not retain the\r\nimpression of images which have passed across the mind in light and rapid\r\nsuccession, and which, therefore, exhibit but a partial and imperfect\r\nsketch of the picture that engaged the attention in sleep. The well-known\r\nfact that the impressions of our dreams are oftentimes more vivid and\r\ncorrect, when some time has elapsed, than on our awakening, tends to\r\nconfirm this hypothesis; and these recollections are the more vivid when\r\nthey bear any analogy to circumstances that come to pass.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Brown was of opinion that sleep was the waking of the soul; the\r\nligation of sense, but the liberty of reason; and that our waking\r\nconceptions do not match the fancies of our sleep. He thus expresses\r\nhimself in his Religio Medici: \"At my nativity my ascendant was the watery\r\nsign of Scorpius; I was born in the planetary hour of Saturn, and I think\r\nI have a piece of that leaden planet in me. I am no way facetious, nor\r\ndisposed for the mirth and galliardise of company; yet in one dream I can\r\ncompose a whole comedy, behold the action, apprehend the jests, and laugh\r\nmyself awake at the conceits thereof. Were my memory as faithful as my\r\nreason is then fruitful, I would never study but in my dreams, and this\r\ntime also would I choose for my devotions; but our grosser memories have\r\nthen so little hold of our abstracted understandings, that they forget the\r\nstory, and can only relate to our awaked souls a confused and broken tale\r\nof that that hath passed.\"\r\n\r\nDreams have been considered as prescriptive in various diseases. Diodorus\r\nSiculus relates that a certain Scythian dreamed that Aesculapius had drawn\r\nthe humours of his body to one place, or head, to have it lanced. When\r\nGalen had an inflammation of the diaphragm, we are told that he was\r\ndirected in a dream to open a vein between the thumb and the fourth\r\nfinger--an operation which restored him to health. Marcus Antoninus\r\nasserted that he learned in his dreams various remedies for spitting of\r\nblood. It is related of Sir Christopher Wren, that, when at Paris, in\r\n1671, being disordered with \"a pain in his reins,\" he sent for a\r\nphysician, who prescribed blood-letting, but he deferred submitting to it,\r\nand dreamed that very night that he was in a place where palm-trees grew,\r\nand that a woman in a romantic habit offered dates to him. The next day he\r\nsent for dates, which cured him. Now, although this cure, brought about by\r\na dream, was considered wonderful, its circumstances offer nothing\r\nsupernatural. It is more than probable that Sir Christopher had frequently\r\nread in foreign works on medicine, that dates were recommended as an\r\nefficacious remedy in nephritic complaints; and, moreover, had met in his\r\ndaily perambulations female quacks, who exhibit themselves to this day in\r\nthe French metropolis, fantastically attired, and vending their far-famed\r\nnostrums. That he should have remembered dates, and that the phantasm of\r\nthe she-mountebank might at the same time have struck his fancy, were two\r\nassociations by no means improbable.\r\n\r\nIt is very likely that all the strange stories of prophetic dreams might\r\nbe traced to a similar connexion of ideas. I have before observed that\r\ndreams do not always assume their complexion from recent occurrences, and\r\nour bodily sufferings during sleep bring to our recollection every\r\ncircumstance that regards the malady. A patient who had a bottle of hot\r\nwater placed at his feet dreamed that he was walking in great agony in the\r\nburning lava of Vesuvius. Similar associations exist when awake: the man\r\nwhose arm has been amputated constantly refers the pain he experiences to\r\nthe lost hand, or to that part of the limb which received the injury; and\r\nthe very same nervous illusion prevails during his slumbers. A case is\r\nrecorded of an officer who had lost his leg, and, when cold, felt comfort\r\nand warmth by wrapping the stump of his wooden leg in flannel.\r\n\r\nIn various diseases the nature and the period of the invasion of dreams\r\nafford a valuable ground of observation to the physician both in his\r\ndiagnosis and prognosis of the case. In incipient hydro-thorax, for\r\ninstance, dreams occur at the very moment the patient falls asleep, and he\r\nfancies himself suffocated by some impending and destructive weight.\r\nDiseases of the heart are accompanied by alarming dreams, from which the\r\npatient starts up in great terror. In children the perturbation of their\r\nsleep frequently indicates the seat of their sufferings; and the valuable\r\nresearches on the nervous system by Charles Bell have enabled the medical\r\nattendant to read in the features of a sleeping infant whether the malady\r\nbe in the head, the cavity of the chest, or the abdomen.\r\n\r\nIf proof were wanting that dreams arise from our waking thoughts, it might\r\nbe found in the circumstance of those sleepers who divulge their secrets,\r\nand verify the lines of Shakspeare:\r\n\r\n  There are a kind of men so loose of soul,\r\n  That in their sleep will mutter their affairs.\r\n\r\nReason, therefore, prompts us to reject the idea of dreams being\r\npreternatural suggestions. In general, we may consider them as a morbid\r\nexcitement of the brain, arising either from moral or physical causes, and\r\ndepending essentially on the condition of our mind and body. Our most\r\nlively hopes are ever linked with fears that prey upon us even when most\r\nsecure; and these apprehensions, recurring in our dreams, prove too often\r\nprophetic of the very events we dreaded. The prejudices of early education\r\nshed around these forewarnings circumstantial incidents; and fear is the\r\ngreatest ally of superstition.\r\n\r\nIf our visions by night are fraught with such singular circumstances, our\r\n\"day dreams,\" or _reveries_, are frequently attended with strange\r\nassociations. The impressions received during these ecstatic visions or\r\ntrances will occasionally act so powerfully upon the mind, that during our\r\nwaking hours and the usual pursuits of life we cannot divest ourselves of\r\nthe existence of their reality.\r\n\r\nDr. Arnould has given the following curious account of a case of this\r\nkind, as narrated by the individual himself:--\"One afternoon in the month\r\nof May, feeling himself a little unsettled and not inclined to business,\r\nhe thought he would take a walk into the city to amuse his mind, and\r\nhaving strolled into St. Paul's Churchyard, he stopped at the shop window\r\nof Carrington and Bowles, and looked at the pictures, among which was one\r\nof the cathedral. He had not been long there before a short grave-looking\r\nelderly gentleman, dressed in dark brown clothes, came up and began to\r\nexamine the prints, and occasionally casting a glance at him, very soon\r\nentered into conversation with him, and praising the view of St. Paul's\r\nwhich was exhibited at the window, told him many anecdotes of Sir\r\nChristopher Wren the architect, and asked him at the same time if he had\r\never ascended to the top of the dome. He replied in the negative. The\r\nstranger then inquired if he had dined, and proposed that they should go\r\nto an eating-house in the neighbourhood, adding that after dinner he would\r\naccompany him up St. Paul's. It was a glorious afternoon for a view, and\r\nhe was so familiar with the place that he could point out every object\r\nworthy of attention. The kindness of the old gentleman's manner induced\r\nhim to comply with the invitation, and they went to a tavern in some dark\r\nalley, the name of which he did not know. They dined and very soon left\r\nthe table, and ascended to the ball just below the cross, which they\r\nentered alone.\r\n\r\n\"They had not been there many minutes, when, while he was gazing on the\r\nextensive prospect and delighted with the splendid scene below him, the\r\ngrave gentleman pulled out from an inside coat-pocket something like a\r\ncompass, having round the edge some curious figures; then having muttered\r\nsome unintelligible words, he placed it in the centre of the ball. He felt\r\na great trembling, and a sort of horror came over him, which was increased\r\nby his companion asking him if he should like to see any friend at a\r\ndistance and to know what he was at that time doing, for if so, the latter\r\ncould show him any such person. It happened that his father had been for a\r\nlong time in bad health and for some weeks past he had not visited him. A\r\nsudden thought came into his mind, so powerful, that it overcame his\r\nterror, that he should like to see his father. He had no sooner expressed\r\nthe wish than the exact person of his father was immediately presented to\r\nhis sight in the mirror, reclining in his armchair and taking his\r\nafternoon sleep. Not having fully believed in the power of the stranger to\r\nmake good his offer, he became overwhelmed with terror at the clearness\r\nand truth of the vision presented to him, and he entreated his mysterious\r\ncompanion that they might immediately descend, as he felt himself very\r\nill. The request was complied with, and on parting under the portico of\r\nthe northern entrance, the stranger said to him, 'Remember you are the\r\nslave of the man of the mirror.'\"\r\n\r\nHe returned in the evening to his home, he does not know exactly at what\r\nhour; felt himself unquiet, depressed, gloomy, apprehensive, and haunted\r\nwith thoughts of the stranger. For the last three months he has been\r\nconscious of the power of the latter over him. Dr. Arnould adds, \"I\r\ninquired in what way his power was exercised? He cast on me a look of\r\nsuspicion mingled with confidence, took my arm, and after leading me\r\nthrough two or three rooms and then into the garden, exclaimed, 'It is of\r\nno use--there is no concealment from him, for all places are alike open to\r\nhim--he sees us--and he hears _us now_.' I asked him where the being was\r\nwho saw us and heard us? He replied in a voice of deep agitation, 'Have I\r\nnot told you that he lives in the ball below the cross on the top of St.\r\nPaul's, and that he only comes down to take a walk in the churchyard and\r\nget his dinner at the house in the dark alley. Since that fatal interview\r\nwith the necromancer,' he continued, 'for such I believe him to be, he is\r\ncontinually dragging me before him in his mirror--he not only sees me\r\nevery moment of the day, but he reads all my thoughts, and I have a\r\ndreadful consciousness that no action of my life is free from his\r\ninspection, and no place can afford me security from his power.' On my\r\nreply that the darkness of the night would afford him protection from\r\nthese machinations, he said, 'I know what you mean, but you are quite\r\nmistaken--I have only told you of the mirror, but in some part of the\r\nbuilding which he passed on coming away, he showed me what he called a\r\ngreat bell, and I heard sounds which came from it, and which went to it,\r\nsounds of laughter, and of anger, and of pain; there was a dreadful\r\nconfusion of sounds, and I listened with wonder and affright'--he said,\r\n'this is my organ of hearing; this great bell is in communication with all\r\nthe other bells within the circle of hieroglyphics, by which every word\r\nspoken by those under my control is made audible to me.' Seeing me look\r\nsurprised at him, he said, 'I have not yet told you all, for he practises\r\nhis spells by hieroglyphics on walls and houses, and wields his power,\r\nlike a detestable tyrant as he is, over the minds of those whom he has\r\nenchanted, and who are the objects of his constant spite within the circle\r\nof his hieroglyphics.' I asked him what these hieroglyphics were, and how\r\nhe perceived them? He replied, 'Signs and symbols which you in your\r\nignorance of their true meaning have taken for letters and words, and\r\nread, as you have thought, _Day and Martin_ and _Warren's blacking_. Oh!\r\nthat is all nonsense! they are only the mysterious characters which he\r\nplaces to mark the boundaries of his dominions, and by which he prevents\r\nall escape from his tremendous power. How I have toiled and laboured to\r\nget beyond the limits of his influence! Once I walked for three days and\r\nthree nights, till I fell down under a wall exhausted by fatigue, and\r\ndropped asleep; but on awaking I saw the dreadful sign before my eyes, and\r\nI felt myself as completely under his infernal spell at the end as at the\r\nbeginning of the journey.'\"\r\n\r\nDr. Pritchard remarks on this singular case of insanity, that this\r\ngentleman had actually ascended to the top of St. Paul's, and that\r\nimpressions there received being afterwards renewed in his mind when in a\r\nstate of vivid excitement, in a dream or ecstatic revery, became so\r\nblended with the creation of fancy, as to form one mysterious vision, in\r\nwhich the true and the imaginary were afterwards inseparable.\r\n\r\nIt is also possible that this person, being of a nervous and susceptible\r\ndisposition, had been struck, when on the dizzy height of the cupola, with\r\na vertigo, or fit, during which these phantasms had struck him in so vivid\r\na manner as to derange his intellects--the loud and terrific sound of the\r\nbell adding to the horror of his situation. It is well known that persons\r\nhave recollected circumstances that occurred around them during an\r\nepileptic and an apoplectic attack. Our worthy visionary was for two years\r\nan inmate of a private asylum.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the verification of dreams, they may be easily accounted for\r\nby that proneness that most men, especially if of a weak and\r\nimpressionable state of mind, experience in courting the object of their\r\nhopes or fears. Thus have the absurd prognostications of fortune-tellers\r\nbeen too frequently fatal, as we may work up our thoughts to such an\r\nintensity as to bring on the very death that we apprehend. Dr. Pritchard\r\nrelates the case of a clergyman, in an indifferent state of health, who,\r\nwhen standing one day at the corner of a street, saw a funeral procession\r\napproaching him. He waited till it came near him, saw all the train pass\r\nhim, with black nodding plumes, and read his own name on the coffin, which\r\nwas carried by, and entered, with the whole procession, into the house\r\nwhere he resided. This was the commencement of an illness which put an end\r\nto his life in a few days.\r\n\r\nDuring a severe fever, in the peninsula, my nightly rest was constantly\r\ndisturbed by the threatening appearance of animals with fearful horns and\r\nantlers, incessantly hovering about me. For a long time after my recovery\r\nthe spectral illusion continued, and every horse or mule that passed by\r\nme appeared to be armed with immense horns.\r\n\r\nIt is to be feared that, notwithstanding the ingenuity of the many\r\nphysiologists who have sought to investigate the nature of dreams, we\r\nshall never come to any satisfactory conclusion, since we follow too\r\nfrequently the example of the German philosopher, Lesage, who, in his\r\nendeavour to throw some light on this obscure subject, sought to ascertain\r\nthe intermediate condition of the mind when passing from the waking state\r\ninto sleep, a transition which never has been, and, most probably, never\r\ncan be ascertained, since sleep, to a certain degree, is a suspension of\r\nall power of attention, perception, volition, and every spontaneous\r\nfaculty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON FLAGELLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmongst the various moral and physical remedies introduced by the\r\npriesthood and physicians for the benefit of society, flagellation once\r\nheld a most distinguished rank. As a remedy, it was supposed to reanimate\r\nthe torpid circulation of the capillary or cutaneous vessels, to increase\r\nmuscular energy, promote absorption, and favour the necessary secretions\r\nof our nature. No doubt, in many instances, its action as a revulsive may\r\nbe beneficial; and urtication, or the stinging with nettles, has not\r\nunfrequently been prescribed with advantage. As a religious discipline,\r\nfor such has this system of mortification been called, it has been\r\nconsidered as most acceptable to Heaven; so much so, indeed, that the\r\nfustigation was commensurate with the sinner's offence. Under the head of\r\nDaemonomania I have endeavoured to show that whipping was equally agreeable\r\nto the evil spirit, who delighted in flogging the elect.\r\n\r\nIt appears that at this period a belief prevailed that heavenly mercy\r\nrestored the grace that had been forfeited, commuting for temporal\r\npunishment that which else would have been eternal. The monks of Fonte\r\nAvellana, for instance, had decreed that thirty psalms, said or sung, with\r\nan accompaniment of one hundred stripes to each psalm, would be considered\r\nas a set-off for one year of purgatory; and, by this calculation, the\r\nwhole psalter, which would have demanded fifteen thousand stripes, would\r\nhave procured a relief of five years from the fiery ordeal. It was no\r\ndoubt under this impression that St. Dominic the Cuirassier, so named from\r\nhis wearing, day and night, an iron cuirass next his skin, and which he\r\nnever took off, adopted this same covering when, upon entering into\r\npriest's orders, his parents presented the bishop who ordained him with a\r\nrich fur garment, an offence for which the holy man wished to atone by\r\ndonning an iron vestment.\r\n\r\nThis said madman belonged to the congregation of Fonte Avellana, the monks\r\nof which never touched either wine or oil, and, during five days of the\r\nweek, lived upon bread and water; moreover, every day after service they\r\nflogged each other. Dominic, in extenuation of his family's offence in\r\nhaving presented his diocesan with a luxurious gown, lashed himself at the\r\nrate of ten psalters, and thirty thousand lashes _per diem_; by which he\r\ncalculated that he was redeeming three thousand six hundred and fifty\r\nyears of purgatorial torments _per annum_: but, in addition to this\r\nwholesome allowance, he humbly petitioned his superior to allow him,\r\nduring Lent, a supplementary punishment of one hundred years, when his\r\nday's work was two psalters and a half, and thirty-four thousand five\r\nhundred lashes. This punishment did not seem sufficient in his eyes to\r\npropitiate the Creator; and St. Pietro Damiano informs us that, during the\r\nLenten days, he actually recited the psalter two hundred times, with a\r\n_crescendo_ accompaniment of sixty millions of stripes. It was on this\r\noccasion that Yepes shrewdly observed, that he marvelled less at a man's\r\nhead being able to retain so many verses than that his arm was able to\r\ncarry on such a flagellation; or, to use his own words, how his flesh,\r\nunless made of iron, could resist such a castigation. This blessed man\r\nmust have been endowed with powers that were increased by exertion, since\r\nwe find that his ambition gave him such energy, that once beginning his\r\noperations in the evening, and singing and flogging, and flogging and\r\nsinging, _con amore_, through the day and night, at the expiration of\r\ntwenty-four hours he had gone through the psalms twelve times, begun them\r\na thirteenth time, and proceeded as far as _Beati quorum_, the\r\nthirty-second psalm; having inflicted upon himself one hundred and\r\neighty-three thousand one hundred stripes, thereby reducing purgatorial\r\nstock to the amount of sixty-one years, twelve days, and thirty-three\r\nminutes, to a fraction.\r\n\r\nIt would be perfectly idle and absurd for any freethinker to doubt this\r\nfact, recorded by an eyewitness--Pietro Damiano, a saint, and moreover a\r\ncardinal; and Calmet himself maintains that no man should dare to doubt a\r\nsaint's assertion, more especially when speaking of another beatified\r\nperson. Notwithstanding this assertion, a stiff-necked arithmetician\r\ncalculated that, if during these twenty-four hours the saint had given\r\nhimself two blows every second, the number of lashes would only have\r\namounted to one hundred and seventy-two thousand eight hundred, being ten\r\nthousand three hundred short of the amount stated! However, this\r\ndifficulty was overcome by Father Castaniza, who makes up the amount by\r\nmaintaining that he made use of cats with ten tails, and therefore had\r\nactually a balance in his favour in his _winding_-sheet.[28]\r\n\r\n_Ubi stimulus ibi affluxus_, has been a physiological axiom since the days\r\nof Hippocrates; and flagellation thus employed is only a modification of\r\nblistering, or exciting the skin by any other irritating method. The moral\r\ninfluence of flagellation in the treatment of different diseases has been\r\nappreciated by the ancients: it was strongly recommended by the disciples\r\nof Asclepiades, by Caelius Aurelianus, and since by Rhasis and Valescus, in\r\nthe treatment of mania. No doubt, the terror which this castigation\r\ninspires may tend materially to facilitate the management of the insane.\r\nTo the present day this opinion has prevailed to a revolting degree, and\r\nit is no easy matter for the humane physician to convince a keeper of the\r\ncruelty or inutility of this practice. Seldom or never does this harsh\r\nmanagement become necessary: I had charge of a military lunatic asylum for\r\na considerable time, and, with one exception, never found myself warranted\r\nin causing corporal punishment to be inflicted, notwithstanding the\r\nassociation of ideas of discipline which such a chastisement must have\r\nproduced amongst men then exposed to the capricious infliction of the\r\nlash. The case to which I allude was one of a Sergeant N--, who had twice\r\nattempted my life, and who fully remembered every circumstance in the\r\nremissions of his malady; so much so, indeed, that doubts were entertained\r\nin the minds of the casual visiter as to the real condition of his mental\r\nfaculties; and in the establishment now under my superintendence a keeper\r\nis discharged when convicted of having struck a patient _under any\r\ncircumstances_.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression: the authoritative power of man over the\r\nbrute creation is daily witnessed, even with unruly and ferocious\r\nanimals; and there are, no doubt, cases where bodily punishment becomes\r\nindispensable, when the body will feel what the judgment cannot\r\ncomprehend. Boerhaave relates the case of a hypochondriac who swore that\r\nhis legs were made of straw; but an officious servant-maid, who was\r\nsweeping the room, struck him across the shins with her broomstick, and\r\nsoon brought him to a sense of his erroneous impression.\r\n\r\nFlagellation draws the circulation from the centre of our system to its\r\nperiphery. It has been known in a fit of ague to dispel the cold stage.\r\nGalen had observed that horse-dealers were in the habit of bringing their\r\nhorses into high condition by a moderate fustigation; and therefore\r\nrecommended this practice to give _embonpoint_ to the lean. Antonius Musa\r\ntreated a sciatica of Octavius Augustus by this process. Elidaeus Paduanus\r\nrecommends flagellation or urtication when the eruption of exanthematic\r\ndiseases is slow in its development. Thomas Campanella records the case of\r\na gentleman whose bowels could not be relieved without his having been\r\npreviously whipped.\r\n\r\nIrritation of the skin has been often observed to be productive of similar\r\neffects. The erotic irregularities of lepers is well authenticated; and\r\nvarious other cutaneous diseases, which procure the agreeable relief that\r\nscratching affords, have brought on the most pleasurable sensations. There\r\nexists a curious letter of Abelard to his Eloisa, in which he says,\r\n\"Verbera quandoque dabat amor, non furor; gratia, non ira; quae omnium\r\nunguentorum suavitatem transcenderent.\"\r\n\r\nThis effect of flagellation may be easily referred to the powerful\r\nsympathy that exists between the nerves of the lower part of the spinal\r\nmarrow and other organs. Artificial excitement appears in some degree\r\nnatural: it is observed in various animals, especially in the feline\r\ntribe. Even snails plunge into each other a bony and prickly spur that\r\narises from their throats, and which, like the sting of the wasp,\r\nfrequently breaks off and is left in the wound.\r\n\r\nIn the monastic orders of both sexes, flagellation became a refined art.\r\nFlagellation was of two species, the upper and the lower; the upper\r\ninflicted upon the shoulders, the lower chiefly resorted to when females\r\nwere to be fustigated. This mode was adopted, according to their\r\nassertions, from the accidents that might have happened in the upper\r\nflagellation, where the twisting lash might have injured the sensitive\r\nbosom. In addition to this device, nudity was also insisted upon. In the\r\narticle Daemonomania I have recorded various abominations of the kind. Nor\r\nwas it only amongst religious orders and their followers that this custom\r\nobtained. It was practised by ladies of high rank amongst their commensals\r\nand attendants. Brantome gives us a curious and quaint account of this\r\namusing castigation. Mademoiselle de Limeuil, one of the queen's maids of\r\nhonour, was flagellated for having written a pasquinade, in company with\r\nall the young ladies who had been privy to the composition. And on another\r\noccasion he tells us: \"J'ai oui parler d'une grande dame de par le monde,\r\nvoire grandissime, mariee et veuve, qui faisait depouiller ses dames et\r\nfilles, je dis les plus belles, et se delectait fort a les voir, et puis\r\nelle les battait du plat de la main, avec de grandes clacquades et\r\nblamuses assez rudes; et les filles qui avaient delinque en quelque chose,\r\navec de bonnes verges, et elle les clacquait ainsi selon le sujet qu'elles\r\nlui en donnaient, pour les faire ou rire ou pleurer.\"\r\n\r\nThe minions of Henry III. of France, and other princes, were decked in\r\nwhite robes, then stripped, and whipped in procession for the\r\ngratification of their royal masters. Not unfrequently the ladies\r\nthemselves were the executioners in cases where any man had offended them;\r\nand the adventure of Clopinel the poet is worth relating. This unfortunate\r\nwight had written the following lines on the fair sex:\r\n\r\n  Toutes etes, serez, ou futes,\r\n  De fait ou de volonte putes;\r\n  Et qui bien vous chercherait\r\n  Toutes putes vous trouverait.\r\n\r\nThis libellous effusion naturally excited the indignation of the ladies at\r\ncourt, who decided that Clopinel should be flagellated by the plaintiffs\r\nwithout mercy; and it is difficult to say to what extent they might have\r\ncarried their vengeance but for a timely witticism of the culprit, who\r\npiteously addressing the angry yet beauteous group around him with\r\nuplifted arm and rod, humbly entreated that the first blow might be struck\r\nby the honourable damsel who felt herself the most aggrieved. It is\r\nneedless to add that not a lash was inflicted.\r\n\r\nMedical men were frequently consulted as to the adoption of the upper or\r\nlower discipline, as flagellation on the shoulders was said to injure the\r\neyesight. It was from the fear of this accident that the lower discipline\r\nwas generally adopted amongst nuns and female penitents, as appears by the\r\nfollowing rule: \"Quippe cum ea de causa capucini, multaeque moniales,\r\nvirorum medicorum ac piorum hominum consilio, ascesim flagellandi sursum\r\nhumeros reliquerint, ut sibi nates lumbosque strient asperatis virgis, ac\r\nnodosis funiculis conscribillent.\"\r\n\r\nIn a medical point of view, urtication, or stinging with nettles, is a\r\npractice not sufficiently appreciated. In many instances, especially in\r\ncases of paralysis, it is more efficacious than blistering or stimulating\r\nfrictions. Its effects, although perhaps less permanent, are more general\r\nand diffused over the limb. This process has been found effectual in\r\nrestoring heat to the lower extremities; and a case of obstinate lethargy\r\nwas cured by Corvisart by repeated urtication of the whole body. During\r\nthe action of the stimulus, the patient, who was a young man, would open\r\nhis eyes and laugh, but sink again into profound sleep. His perfect cure,\r\nhowever, was obtained in three weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON LIFE AND THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE OF ALL FLESH IS THE BLOOD THEREOF. On this doctrine, expressed in\r\nthe Mosaic books, many of the olden writers founded their hypothesis that\r\nblood was the principle of life. It is, however, more than probable that\r\nthis opinion was derived from a more ancient ritual than the Levitical\r\ncode, since we find a similar belief among the Parsees, Hindoos, and other\r\nOriental nations of very remote antiquity, who no doubt owed the practice\r\nof abstaining from blood to the early patriarchs.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks and the Romans, if we take the expressions of their poets as\r\nbeing conclusive, entertained similar notions regarding the vital fluid;\r\nand the \"purple death\" of Homer and \"the purple life\" of Virgil, are\r\nphrases evidently applicable to this theory, which Critias, Empedocles,\r\nand their sects maintained. This opinion, however, does not appear to have\r\ndictated the expressions made use of by Moses. When he says \"the life of\r\nall flesh is the blood thereof,\" it merely signifies that when the blood\r\nis abstracted death ensues; a circumstance that must have been daily and\r\nhourly observed. It is probable that this injunction was promulgated to\r\ncheck the barbarous custom of devouring raw meat, which seems to have\r\nprevailed long before the Jewish legislator. We read in Genesis ix. 4,\r\n\"Flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall you not\r\neat.\" From this circumstance we may infer that, like the Abyssinians of\r\nBruce's time, the Jews were in the habit of tearing and cutting flesh from\r\nlive animals. Saul's army was guilty of a similar practice. It therefore\r\nbehoved their legislators to oppose a custom that increased the natural\r\nferocity and cruelty of the nation they ruled.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the ancients has been frequently revived in modern times,\r\nand has not a little contributed to increase the mystery that veils the\r\nnature of our existence. Harvey, who discovered the circulation of the\r\nblood, was a convert to this doctrine; Hoffman also adopted it; and Huxham\r\nnot only fully believed in it, but sought the immediate part of the blood\r\nthat constituted life, and fancied that he had discovered it in its red\r\nparticles. It was John Hunter, however, who first established the system\r\non any thing like a rational basis, although his arguments on the subject\r\nhave led to much doubt and illiberal controversy. \"The difficulty,\" says\r\nhe, \"of conceiving that blood is endowed with life while circulating,\r\narises merely from its being a fluid, and the mind not being accustomed to\r\nthe idea of a living fluid. I shall endeavour,\" he continues, \"to show\r\nthat organization and life do not in the least depend upon each other;\r\nthat organization may arise out of living parts and produce action; but\r\nthat life can never arise out of or produce organization.\" The errors of\r\nthis doctrine are obvious, and have led many ingenious physiologists into\r\na maze of idle wandering. The fact is, that life is the instrument of\r\norganization, or, in other words, organization is the result of life. The\r\nembryo could not be developed, did not the fluid that animates it possess\r\na principle of vitality which it communicates to a body previously\r\norganized. In this confusion the word \"life\" has sometimes been applied to\r\nthe power, and at others to the result. Without organization, life cannot\r\nbe transmitted; and the moment the principle of life ceases, a\r\ndisorganization, more or less rapid, ensues.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the vitality of the blood has very lately been maintained\r\nby several physiologists. Professor Schultz speaks of an active vital\r\nprocess which can be seen constantly going on between the individual\r\nmolecules of the blood and the substance of the vessels; but Muller\r\nasserts that, during ten years, he examined the circulation of the blood\r\nin various parts, at every opportunity and with different instruments,\r\nbut had never seen what Schultz describes--the constant assimilation,\r\ndisappearance, and new formation of the globules; nor had Rudolphi,\r\nPurkinje, Koch, and Meyer, been more successful in their investigation;\r\nand Muller further maintains that the motion of these red particles in the\r\ncirculation is purely passive, which may be proved by compressing the\r\nvessels of the limb, or the limb itself.\r\n\r\nEber and Meyer pretended that these red particles were infusory animals.\r\nOn this important and curious subject I shall quote Muller's opinion: \"The\r\nquestion whether the blood be living fluid or not, calls to mind a\r\ncritical state of our science. Every thing which evidences an action which\r\ncannot be explained by the laws of inorganic matter, is said to have an\r\norganic, or, what is the same thing, a vital property. To regard merely\r\nthe solids of the body as living, is incorrect, for there are strictly no\r\norganic solids; in nearly all, water constitutes four-fifths of their\r\nweight. Although, then, organic matter generally be considered as merely\r\n'susceptible of life,' and the organized parts as 'living,' yet the blood\r\nalso must be regarded as endowed with life, for its action cannot be\r\ncomprehended from chemical and physical laws. The semen is not merely a\r\nstimulus for the fructification of the egg, for it impregnates the eggs of\r\nthe Batrachia and fishes out of the body; and the form, endowments, and\r\neven tendencies to disease, of the father, are transferred to the new\r\nindividual. The semen, therefore, although a fluid, is evidently endowed\r\nwith life, and is capable of imparting life to matter. The impregnable\r\npart of the egg, the germinal membrane, is a completely unorganized\r\naggregation of animal matter; but, nevertheless, is animated with the\r\nwhole organizing power of the future being, and is capable of imparting\r\nlife to a new matter, although soft, and nearly allied to a fluid. The\r\nblood also evidences organic properties; it is attracted by living organs,\r\nwhich are acted upon by vital stimuli. There subsists between the blood\r\nand the organized parts a reciprocal vital action, in which the blood has\r\nas large a share as the organs in which it circulates.\"\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is, no doubt, ingenious, but I do not consider it as\r\nconclusive. It is not because that in inflammation, the blood becoming\r\nsolid, forming pseudo membranes, which are shortly after supplied with a\r\nproportion of blood-vessels, blood possesses life. If this adventitious\r\ncoagulation were not supplied with blood, it would prove a foreign body;\r\nbut it is not, therefore, shown that the circumstance of its possessing\r\nvitality after its formation is a proof of the life of the blood; it only\r\nshows that the secretions of the blood are endowed with a susceptibility\r\nof life, when having assumed a solid form, needing vessels for its\r\nsupport. I shall not dwell longer on a professional question of great\r\ninterest, but which would need a development foreign to the nature of\r\nthese sketches.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks had distinct appellations for the cause and result of life; the\r\nformer they termed [Greek: psyche] the latter [Greek: zoe]. The essential\r\nnature of life is, and most probably will ever remain, an impenetrable\r\nmystery. Living matter is endowed with a property which we call life; but\r\nto find out to what we may venture to attribute this property, is a vain\r\nand hypothetical attempt. Equally vain and absurd have been the endeavours\r\nto ascertain whether life began at the creation to be subsequently\r\ntransmitted from parent to offspring, or owed its origin to a spontaneous\r\ngeneration from matter. Many ancient philosophers considered matter as\r\neternal: such was the doctrine of the Pythagoreans; amongst whom we must\r\nparticularly notice Lucanus Ocellus, whose system, developed in a work\r\nwritten in the Attic dialect, was adopted by Aristotle, Plato, and\r\nPhilo-Judaeus. This work was first translated into Latin by Nogarola. These\r\ndoctrines led to the unanswerable question, What was this matter--this\r\n_invisa materia_--from which every thing visible has proceeded? Has it\r\nexisted from all eternity, or has it been called into being by the\r\nCreator? Has it uniformly exhibited its present harmonious arrangement, or\r\nwas it once a waste and shapeless chaos? Was this matter endowed with\r\nintelligence as a whole, or in its separate fractions?\r\n\r\nThe eternity of matter was maintained by these philosophers from the\r\nbelief that _no thing could be created out of nothing, and that no thing\r\ncould ever return to nonentity_. Such was the doctrine of the Epicureans,\r\nof Democritus, and of Aristotle. The poets were of the same belief; and\r\nLucretius expresses himself as follows:\r\n\r\n          Ubi viderimus nihil posse creari\r\n  De nihilo, tune, quod sequimur, jam rectius inde\r\n  Perspiciemus.\r\n\r\nPersius maintains the same idea:\r\n\r\n                                Gigni\r\n  De nihilo nil, in nihilum nil posse reverti.\r\n\r\nThis dogma was no doubt transmitted to the Greeks from the East; and, to\r\nthe present day, it is a doctrine of the Brahminical creed, clearly\r\nexpressed in the following terms in their Yajur Veid: \"The ignorant assert\r\nthat the universe in the beginning did not exist in its author, and that\r\nit was created out of nothing. O ye, whose hearts are pure! how could\r\nsomething arise out of nothing?\" The fathers of the church embraced a\r\nsimilar belief; and Justin Martin says that \"the word of God formed the\r\nworld out of _unfashioned matter_. This Moses distinctly asserts, Plato\r\nand his adherents maintain, and ourselves have been taught to believe.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the doctrine of the schools that professed the eternal nature of\r\nmatter. Other philosophers supported as warmly a different opinion. Thales\r\nof Miletus, Zeno of Citium, Xenocrates, and Dicearchus the Messenian,\r\ninsisted that the human race had a first origin at a period when mankind\r\ndid not exist. According to this hypothesis, the universe is an emanation\r\nor extension of the essence of the Creator. Zeno and the Stoics attribute\r\nthis creation to the universal elements of fire and water. Anaximander the\r\nMilesian asserted that the primitive animals were formed of earth and\r\nwater mixed together, heated and animated by the solar rays; these aquatic\r\ncreatures became amphibious, and were gradually transformed into the human\r\nraces. Strange to say, this extraordinary idea has found proselytes even\r\nin our days, and was advocated by Professor De Lamark in his Zoological\r\nPhilosophy. This fancy pervades the poetry of the ancients. Homer makes\r\nTethys, the wife of Ocean, the daughter of Uranus and Terra, the first\r\nparents; and Hesiod, in his Cosmogony, raises Venus and Proteus from the\r\nfoam of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe vital and intellectual fire of the ancients that animated all living\r\nbeings was admitted by most of their physicians, especially by\r\nHippocrates, Galen, and Aretaeus. Aristotle describes an universal creative\r\nagent in all the elements, the source of life upon earth, and of the\r\ncelestial movements in the firmament. Descartes, in modern times,\r\nmaintained that a vital flame existed in the heart of every animal. This\r\nfire, and the genial warmth that it diffused, was considered the soul of\r\nthe universe; and on this subject Gassendi expresses himself as follows:\r\n\"Si quis velit talem calorem etiam animam dicere, nihil est similiter quod\r\nvetet.\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural for man, even in an uncivilized state, to attribute to\r\nsolar heat the same influence on animals as was manifest in its actions\r\nupon plants. When life had fled, the inanimate corpse was cold, and\r\ncaloric was therefore considered the principle of vitality. It was from\r\nthis conviction that we find the sun and fire objects of adoration both in\r\nancient times and amongst savages to the present day. Fire is idolized by\r\nthe Tartars, and various African tribes. The Yakouts, a Siberian horde,\r\nbelieve that the deity of good and evil has taken his abode in this\r\nsupposed element. The Columbian Indians were fire-worshippers; and Pallas\r\ninforms us that the Chinese on the confines of Siberia held it in such\r\nreligious respect, that they never attempted to extinguish it even when\r\ntheir dwellings were burning.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of man and the universe having been created an emanation of\r\nthe Creator, renders the Creator material, or matter itself; matter being\r\nconsidered intelligent, and susceptible of this organization. This was the\r\nbelief of the Brahmins, and was no doubt transmitted to the Academic and\r\nEleatic schools of Greece by Pythagoras. We find in the Yajur Veid,\r\nalready alluded to, the following passages, that clearly demonstrate this\r\nbelief: \"The whole universe is the Creator, proceeds from the Creator, and\r\nreturns to him. The ignorant assert that the universe in the beginning did\r\nnot exist in its author, and that it was created out of nothing. O ye,\r\nwhose hearts are pure! how could something arise out of nothing? This\r\nfirst being alone, and without likeness, was the ALL in the beginning. He\r\ncould multiply himself under different forms. He created fire from his\r\nessence, which is light.\" And further: \"Thou art Brahma! thou art Vishnu!\r\nthou art Kodra! thou art the moon! thou art substance! thou art Djam! thou\r\nart the earth! thou art the world!\"\r\n\r\nThese Brahminical doctrines were, beyond doubt, also held by the Greeks.\r\nIn a poem ascribed to the fabled Orpheus we find the following lines,\r\ntranslated by Mason Good with as much correctness as elegance:\r\n\r\n  Jove first exists, whose thunders roll above,\r\n  Jove last, Jove midmost; all proceeds from Jove.\r\n  Female is Jove--immortal Jove is male;\r\n  Jove the broad earth--the heavens' irradiate pale.\r\n  Jove is the boundless spirit, Jove the fire,\r\n  That warms the world with feeling and desire;\r\n  The sea is Jove, the sun, the lunar ball;\r\n  Jove king supreme, the sovereign source of all.\r\n  All power is his; to him all glory give,\r\n  For his vast form embraces all that live.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily imagined that a subject so recondite and obscure must\r\nhave led philosophers into the wildest speculations. By some, life was\r\nconsidered as the result of a general consent or harmony between the\r\ndifferent organs of which the vital frame is formed; while, as we have\r\nseen, many have attributed its phenomena to the blood. That blood, to a\r\ncertain extent, is endowed with vitality is beyond a doubt; Hunter has\r\nendeavoured to prove the fact by various experiments. It is capable of\r\nbeing acted upon and contracting like the solid fibres; this we daily\r\nwitness when blood is coagulated and comes into contact with the\r\natmosphere. It preserves an equality of temperature in whatever medium an\r\nanimal may move. He also has shown that this fluid can form solid vessels\r\nof every description; and its life is also proved by the death inflicted\r\nwhen any excessive stimulus destroys the muscular fibre. Thus, in a body\r\nstruck with lightning, the muscles remain flaccid and uncontracted, while\r\nthe blood preserves its fluidity, and is left uncoagulated.\r\n\r\nAll this specious reasoning shows that blood is a living fluid, but does\r\nnot in the slightest degree demonstrate to what principle this vitality is\r\nto be attributed. It merely proves that every part of a living animal,\r\nwhether solid or fluid, is endowed with a certain degree of life; but\r\nleaves us in impenetrable darkness as to the nature of life. The one\r\ncannot be killed without the other; and, as Mason Good justly observes,\r\n\"that which is at one time alive, and at another dead, cannot be life\r\nitself.\" It is clear that life cannot exist without blood, but at the same\r\ntime it is equally evident that the blood is merely a secretion of the\r\nliving system, and dependent upon the action of the solids, which\r\ninfluence its quantities and properties.[29]\r\n\r\nIt is from this notion of the vitality of the blood that the absurd idea\r\nof transfusing it was first conceived. Transfusion consisted in the\r\ninjection of the arterial blood of young and healthy animals into the\r\nveins of the aged and the debilitated. It was about forty years after the\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood by Harvey that this singular\r\nproject was tried upon animals, and afterwards upon man. Medicated liquids\r\nhad already been introduced in Germany into the system by this method,\r\nprincipally by Wahrendorf. Dr. Christopher Wren, an English physician, was\r\nthe first who proposed the injection of blood, and Dr. Lower put it into\r\npractice. The result of his experiments seemed to warrant their adoption.\r\nAn animal was drained of a considerable proportion of blood, and lay faint\r\nand expiring; but the blood of another animal being thrown into the\r\nlanguid system, active circulation was restored, and the patient ran about\r\nwith as much facility as before the experiment. When too great a quantity\r\nof blood was injected, the creature became drowsy, and shortly after died\r\nof plethora.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were reported by the transfusers with many absurd\r\ndetails. In one case a simpleton had become witty by a supply of lamb's\r\nblood; in another, an old mangy cur was cured by the vital fluid of a\r\nyoung spaniel; a blind old dog, transfused by a Mr. Gayant, bounded and\r\nfrisked about like a young pup. Dr. Blundel seriously conceived that this\r\noperation might be practised with great advantage in cases of haemorrhage,\r\nmore especially in women.\r\n\r\nOf late years these curious experiments have again been tried with\r\nsingular results. Prevost and Dumas have shown that the vivifying power of\r\nthe blood does not reside so much in the serum as in the red particles. An\r\nanimal bled to syncope, is not revived by the injection of water or pure\r\nserum of a temperature of 68 deg. Fahrenheit into its vessels. But if blood\r\nof one of the same species is used, the animal seems to acquire fresh life\r\nat every stroke of the piston, and is at last restored. Diemenbach has\r\nconfirmed these experiments. It is also stated by these physiologists,\r\nthat revival takes place likewise when the blood injected had been\r\npreviously deprived of its fibrin.\r\n\r\nAnother very singular fact has been elicited by these experiments; blood\r\nof animals of a different genus, of which the corpuscules, though of the\r\nsame form, have a different size, effects an imperfect restoration, and\r\nthe animal generally dies in six days.\r\n\r\nThe injection of blood with circular corpuscules into the vessels of a\r\nbird (in which the corpuscules are elliptic and of a larger size) produces\r\nviolent symptoms similar to those of the strongest poisons, and generally\r\ndeath, which ensues indeed instantaneously, even when a small quantity\r\nonly of the blood has been injected. Such, for example, was the effect of\r\nthe transfusion of some blood of the sheep into the veins of a duck; while\r\nin many cases in which the blood of sheep and oxen were injected into the\r\nvessels of cats and rabbits, these animals were revived for a few days.\r\nThe fact of the blood of mammalia being poisonous to birds is very\r\nremarkable; it cannot be explained mechanically. The injection of fluids\r\ncontaining globules of greater diameter than the capillary vessels of the\r\ninjected animal most probably produces death, by obstructing the pulmonary\r\nvessels and producing suffocation; but the globules of the blood in\r\nmammalia are even smaller than those of birds. In Dieffenbach's\r\nexperiments, pigeons were killed by a few drops only of the blood of\r\nmammalia, and the blood of fishes, it is asserted, is as fatal to mammalia\r\nas to birds.\r\n\r\nThese interesting facts have been confirmed by Dr. Bischoff. In all his\r\nexperiments made with the fresh blood of mammalia, birds died within a few\r\nseconds after the transfusion, with violent symptoms resembling those of\r\npoisoning; but when, instead of the fresh unchanged blood, he injected\r\nblood from which the fibrin had been removed by stirring, and which was\r\nheated to a proper temperature, he was surprised to find that no such\r\nsymptoms were produced, the animal not appearing to suffer any\r\ninconvenience.\r\n\r\nIt seems indeed from these experiments, that the blood of an animal of a\r\ndifferent class, is not adapted for the operation.\r\n\r\nWhen transfusion was first proposed in France, it met with furious\r\nopponents; and Lamartiniere declared that it was a barbarous operation\r\nproceeding from Satan's workshop. The controversy between the transfusers\r\nand their adversaries was at length carried on with such virulence, that\r\nin 1668 the practice was forbidden by a decree of the Chatelet, unless the\r\noperation had been sanctioned by the faculty of Paris. In Italy it\r\ncontinued to be in vogue. Riva and Manfredi frequently performed it; and a\r\nphysician of the name of Simboldus submitted himself to the experiment.\r\nAccording to the accounts given by the patients who had been thus\r\ninjected, they first experienced an increased heat with violent pulsation,\r\nprofuse perspiration with pains in the loins and stomach, and a sense of\r\nsuffocation. Violent vomiting frequently arose, and the patient gradually\r\nsank into a torpid and heavy sleep. Whatever may be the theoretical\r\ningenuity in favour of this practice, it is not probable that it will ever\r\nbe adopted.\r\n\r\nWhile young blood was thus supposed to give fresh vigour to the aged, the\r\nheat communicated by young persons to debilitated bedfellows was also\r\nresorted to. This practice seems to have been founded on observation. It\r\nis an acknowledged fact that an uncommon depression of vital power takes\r\nplace in the young when such experiments are tried. This abstraction of\r\nvital power is frequently observed in young females married to very old\r\nmen. In illustration of this fact, Dr. Copeland relates the following\r\ncase: \"I was a few years since consulted about a pale, sickly, and thin\r\nboy of about five or six years of age. He appeared to have no specific\r\nailment; but there was a slow and remarkable decline of flesh and\r\nstrength, and of the energy of all the functions,--what his mother very\r\naptly termed 'a gradual blight.' After inquiring into the history of the\r\ncase, it came out that he had been a very robust and plethoric child up to\r\nhis third year, when his grandmother, a very aged person, took him to\r\nsleep with her; that he soon afterwards lost his good looks, and that he\r\nhad continued to decline progressively ever since, notwithstanding\r\nmedical treatment. I directed him to sleep apart from his aged parent, and\r\nprescribed gentle tonics, change of air, &c., and the recovery was very\r\nrapid.\"\r\n\r\nThis selfish indulgence of the aged in endeavouring to deprive their young\r\nbedfellows of heat and strength has been often remarked; and young women\r\nthus circumstanced have shrewdly suspected the cause of their debilitated\r\ncondition. It is extremely probable that in these cases electricity is\r\nconducted from one body to another. This hypothesis is in some degree\r\nconfirmed by the experiments made upon Casper Hauser by Von Feuerbach.\r\nThis Casper Hauser had been kept from infancy until he was eighteen years\r\nof age in a perfectly dark cage, without leaving it, and where he never\r\nsaw a living creature or heard the voice of man. He was restricted from\r\nusing his limbs, his voice, his hands, or senses; and his food consisted\r\nof bread and water only, which he found placed by him when wakening from\r\nhis sleep. When exposed in Nuremberg, in 1828, he was consequently at\r\neighteen years as if just come into the world, and as incapable of\r\nwalking, discerning objects, or conveying his impressions, as a newly born\r\ninfant. These faculties, however, he soon acquired; and he was placed\r\nunder an able instructor, who has recorded his singular history. Darkness\r\nhad been to him twilight. The light of day was at first insupportable,\r\ninflamed his eyes, and brought on spasms. Substances, the odour of which\r\ncould not be perceived by others, produced severe effects upon him. The\r\nsmell of a glass of wine, even at a distance, occasioned headache; of\r\nfresh meat, sickness; and of flowers, a painful sensation. Passing by a\r\nchurchyard with Dr. Daumer, the smell of dead bodies, although altogether\r\nimperceptible to the doctor, affected the young man so powerfully as to\r\noccasion shudderings, followed by feverish heat, terminating in a violent\r\nperspiration. He retained a great aversion, owing to their disagreeable\r\ntaste and smell, to all kinds of food excepting bread and water.\r\n\r\nWhen the north pole of a small magnet was held towards him, he described a\r\ndrawing sensation proceeding outwards from the epigastrium, and _as if a\r\ncurrent of air went from him_. The south pole affected him less, and he\r\nsaid it blew upon him. Professor Daumer and Hermann made several\r\nexperiments of the kind, calculated to deceive him, and, even although the\r\nmagnet was held at a considerable distance from him, his feelings always\r\ntold him very correctly. These experiments always occasioned perspiration\r\nand a feeling of indisposition. He could detect metals placed under\r\noil-cloths, paper, &c. by the sensation they occasioned. He described\r\nthese sensations as a drawing, accompanied with a chill, which ascended,\r\naccording to the metal, more or less up the arm, and attended with other\r\ndistinctive feelings, the veins of the hand exposed to the metal becoming\r\nvisibly swollen.\r\n\r\nThe variety and multitude of objects which at once came rushing upon his\r\nattention when he thus suddenly came into existence, the unaccustomed\r\nimpressions of light, free air, and sense, and his anxiety to comprehend\r\nthem, were too much for his weak frame and acute senses: he became\r\ndejected and enfeebled, and his nervous system morbidly elevated. He was\r\nsubject to spasms and tremors, so that partial exclusion from external\r\nexcitements became for a time requisite. After he had learned regularly to\r\neat meat, his mental activity was diminished; his eyes lost their\r\nbrilliancy and expression; the intense application and activity of his\r\nmind gave way to absence or indifference, and the quickness of\r\napprehension became diminished. It may be questioned whether this\r\nalteration proceeded from the change of diet, or the painful excess of\r\nexcitement that had preceded it.\r\n\r\nAmong the various doctrines regarding the creation of animals, that of\r\n_Panspermia_ was most ingenious and attractive. According to this theory,\r\nmaintained by Anaxagoras and Heraclitus, all bodies contained the germ or\r\nthe organic molecules necessary for their generation. Hippocrates favoured\r\nthis idea, as plainly appears in his book _de Diaeta_; and in modern times\r\nPerrault, Gesik, Wollaston, Sturm, and other physiologists, have\r\nendeavoured to revive the doctrine, of which the organic molecules of\r\nBuffon and the living molecules of Ray were merely modifications. The\r\nexpression in Genesis which sanctions the belief that the earth\r\nspontaneously germinated its productions, cannot be referred to the animal\r\nkingdom. Were this the case, similar animals would be found in every\r\nquarter of the globe. Spontaneous generation was also attributed to\r\nputrefaction; and Virgil describes the manner in which Aristaeus drew forth\r\na swarm of bees from the corrupted entrails of a heifer. Pliny admits the\r\nspontaneous creation of rats, mice, frogs, and other small tribes of\r\nanimals. These errors, however, were soon dispelled by the light thrown on\r\nthe subject by the microscopic experiments of Valisneri, Swammerdam,\r\nReaumur, and many other naturalists, who discovered sexual organs in all\r\nthese supposed self-created individuals.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine was the foundation of the classification of the generative\r\nprinciple into _equivocal_ and _univocal generations_,--the former the\r\neffect of putrefaction, but which in reality was _univocal_, since it was\r\nsoon ascertained that this production arose from the incubation of\r\nnumerous eggs deposited by various insects and animalculi in these\r\ncorrupted bodies. The following experiment afforded a convincing proof of\r\nthe fact: A piece of meat was placed in an open vessel, and another in a\r\nvase hermetically closed; so soon as these animal substances entered into\r\ndecomposition, myriads of insects pullulated in the exposed meat, whereas\r\nthat which was protected from external agency remained free from this\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nIt is a recognised fact that it is only through organized beings that\r\norganization can be transmitted; for how can corrupt substances, dead and\r\ndeprived of vitality, give life to any organized matter? Generation is\r\nlife; putrescence is death. By a law of nature, generation may be said\r\nultimately to destroy the generative powers; a striking illustration of\r\nmortality, since life is transmitted at the expense of our very existence,\r\nand many individuals in the catenation of organized beings perish the very\r\nmoment that they have tended to perpetuate their race. Death advances with\r\nrapid strides in the very ratio of the energies of life; and the surest\r\nmethod to attain longevity is to be sparing in the exercise of our\r\nexhausting faculties.\r\n\r\n  Et quasi vitai lampada tradunt.\r\n\r\n_Latent_ or insensible life, such as that of the seeds of plants, or the\r\nanimal enveloped in its egg, may last for a number of years, so long as\r\nthey are able to germinate; here vitality is not worn out by relative\r\nlife. Various species of the snail, the wheel-polybe, the tile-eel, and\r\ndivers animalcules, have been kept apparently dead, and in the form of\r\ndried preparations, withered and hardened, for months and even years, but\r\nhave afterwards been restored to life by the agency of warmth, moisture,\r\nand other stimulants. Snails have been thus reanimated after a lapse of\r\nfifteen years; and Bauer revived the _Vibrio tritici_, after an apparent\r\ndeath of five years and eight months, by merely soaking it in water.\r\nAdders have been found in hard winters not only completely frozen but\r\nabsolutely brittle, yet have been restored to life when thawed. A shower\r\nof fragments of ice has fallen at Leicester, containing the horsehair eel,\r\nwith the nuclei of a greater number. Colonel Wilks found eggs in the solid\r\nrocks of St. Helena susceptible of being hatched. The vitality in the\r\nseeds of plants is truly amazing; barley taken out of the bodies of\r\nmummies, Indian corn discovered in the tomb of a Peruvian Inca, and the\r\nbulb of an onion found in the hand of a mummy 3000 years old have been\r\nsown and have thriven luxuriantly. The most intense heat cannot destroy\r\nthe vital property. The seeds of roasted apples, the kernels of baked\r\nprunes and boiled elder-berries have germinated. Sir John Herschel found\r\nthat the _Acacia Lophanta_ lived after having been steeped in boiling\r\nwater for twelve hours, and Ludwig informs us that the seeds of a species\r\nof cedar only germinated after ebullition. Fresh-water shells have been\r\nfound in the thermal waters of Gastein at a temperature of 117 deg., and\r\nNiebuhr found a conferva growing in water at 142 deg. Raspberry-seeds\r\ntaken from the corpse of an ancient Briton, contemporaneous with the\r\nDruids, have produced fruit when recommitted to the earth.\r\n\r\nSome have endeavoured to explain the resurrection of the dead by these\r\nnatural phenomena; forgetting that in these instances no corruption or\r\nactual disorganization had taken place. Stahl expresses himself in the\r\nfollowing words when defining life: \"Life is formally nothing more than\r\nthe preservation of the body in mixture, corruptible indeed, but without\r\nthe occurrence of corruption;\" and in Junker we find, \"What we call life\r\nis opposite to putridity.\"\r\n\r\nThe next theory attributed the principle of life to a subtle _gas_ or\r\n_aura_. This doctrine constituted one of the principles of the Epicurean\r\nphilosophy, and was illustrated by Lucretius in his poem on the Nature of\r\nThings:\r\n\r\n  Nam penitus prorsum latet haec natura, subestque;\r\n  Nec magis hac infra quidquam est in corpore nostro;\r\n  Atque anima est animae proporro totius ipsa.\r\n\r\nAccording to these notions, there existed a volatile principle that bore\r\nno specific name, but was diffused through every part of living bodies,\r\nmore subtile than heat, air, or vapour. In later times this same gaseous\r\nagent received various appellations. Van Helmont designated it as the\r\n_aura vitalis_, while other philosophers called it the _aura seminalis_\r\nand the _aura sanguinis_. The _archeus faber_ of Van Helmont, the _astrum\r\ninternum_ of Crollius, the _principium energoumenon_ of Michael Alberti,\r\nthe _substantia energetica naturae_ of Glisson, may all be referred to this\r\nunseen but powerful agency. Hippocrates called it [Greek: physis], or\r\nnature, which he elsewhere denominates [Greek: enoronta]. It was also the\r\n[Greek: dynamis xotike] of Galen. This soul, or breath, or spirit,\r\ndirected and preserved the whole economy; and Chrysippus asserts that it\r\nacted like salt upon pork.\r\n\r\nModern chemistry has sought this principle in specific agents. Caloric, or\r\nthe matter of heat; oxygen, or the vital part of atmospheric air, first\r\ndiscovered by Priestley, and explained by Lavoisier; and finally, the\r\nfluid collected by the Voltaic trough, were then considered as the\r\nprinciple of life. The experiments of Professor Galvani of Bologna, in\r\nwhich he produced the phenomena of life many hours after death, induced\r\nmany physiologists to maintain that the identity that existed in galvanic\r\nelectricity and the nervous influence, proved that this _aura_ was the\r\ncreative agent in our economy.\r\n\r\nThe late experiments of Mr. Crosse seemed to show that insects were\r\nproduced in silicate of potash under a long-continued action of voltaic\r\nelectricity. Now whether this be really the case or not, it is grievous in\r\nthe present enlightened age, to see these experiments and the assertions\r\nthat resulted from them, denominated the work of atheism, and the labour\r\nof another Frankenstein!--I do not suppose for one moment that Mr. Crosse\r\npretended to have discovered the power of imparting life, but merely of\r\nhaving developed a vital principle in substances supposed to be inorganic.\r\nEvery experimentalist who thus develops the vital principle may be said to\r\nbestow life, without being exposed to the absurd charge of impiety.--The\r\nman who brings forth chickens from the incubation of eggs, instead of\r\neating them; the physiologist who rots a piece of meat to develop myriads\r\nof living beings in the putrid nidus, might just as well be called an\r\natheist.\r\n\r\nWhile naturalists were thus groping in nature's dark labyrinth,\r\nendeavouring to account for the wonders of the _natura naturans_, that\r\ndivinity of the Stoics that Lucan thus describes,\r\n\r\n          Superos quid quaerimus ultra?\r\n  Jupiter est quodcumque vides, Jovis omnia plena,--\r\n\r\nother wise men fancied that they had actually discovered the seat of\r\nlife, which, according to their fanciful speculations, they had lodged in\r\ncertain organs. The nervous system, the spinal marrow, the brain, the\r\nheart, were all and each of them considered in turn as the head-quarters\r\nof vitality; while the workshop of alimentation, or much-abused stomach,\r\ndid not pass unnoticed and unhonoured. The heart of a turtle, and of some\r\nreptiles, has been seen contracting and dilating hours after its\r\nextraction from the body; the stomach has been excited into an action\r\nbearing some analogy to vomiting, when separated from the trunk; but all\r\nthese curious phenomena, explained and accounted for (in some measure, at\r\nleast) by physiology, do not tend to prove that any one organ, or any\r\nchain of organs, is possessed of separate vitality independent of the\r\ngeneral principle of life. The brain, which has been regarded as the chief\r\nseat of this principle, is not always essential to life; for although man\r\nperishes, or at least his vital functions cease to act, when he is\r\ndecapitated,[30] yet various birds and reptiles continue to live for hours\r\nand days after the head has been severed from the body, while we actually\r\nbehold a regeneration of the head in the earth-worm. Moreover, we have\r\nupon record many cases of _acephalous_ children, or born without any head;\r\nand _anencephalous_ children who lived (for a short time, it is true)\r\nwithout any brains. Fontana removed the entire brain of a turtle, yet it\r\nlived six months, and walked about as before.\r\n\r\nSandiford had divided acephalous animals into three classes: the first, in\r\nwhich the head was wanting; the second, where other organs were also\r\nmissing; and the third, where the foetus presented an unformed mass. In\r\nthe acephalous twin described by Beclard, no liver, spleen, stomach, or\r\noesophagus could be discovered, and the intestinal tube commenced at the\r\nsuperior extremity of the body. The infant had ten ribs on each side, and\r\nregular nerves arose from the spinal marrow. Although headless animals may\r\nnot be gifted with intellectual faculties evident to our senses, yet they\r\nclearly live and feel. The zoophytes and polypes, without brains or heads,\r\npossess irritability and sensibility; they can seek their food, seize it,\r\nreject what is not edible, are susceptible of the powers of light and\r\nheat, can contract their fibres when touched or injured, and, in short,\r\nmanifest various innate or instinctive powers. Gall has maintained that\r\nthe passions resided in the brain, and, therefore, that brainless animals\r\ndid not experience their influence. This is a bold assertion. Can he prove\r\nthat worms, insects, zoophytes, that possess only what is called a\r\nganglionic system, are strangers to instinctive fears and partialities? I\r\napprehend that it will be found that passions belong to instinct much more\r\nthan to our volition.\r\n\r\nIt is nevertheless true that animals may be killed by wounding the spinal\r\nmarrow, by the process commonly called \"_pitting_.\" This practice may be\r\ntraced to high antiquity; and Livy informs us that when the Carthaginian\r\ntroops were routed, Asdrubal ordered their unmanageable elephants to be\r\ndestroyed by driving the point of a knife between the junction of the head\r\nand spine.\r\n\r\nFrom these observations it will appear quite clear that life has no\r\nnecessary connexion with sensation, although the latter cannot be\r\nexperienced without the former. Vegetables are endowed with vitality; but\r\nwe have no reason to suppose that they feel. It is also more than probable\r\nthat, as the degree of intelligence decreases, the intensity of the\r\ncorporeal feelings are also diminished. Did not this scale of sensibility\r\nexist, insects could not live under the supposed agonies that the\r\nentomologist daily inflicts. This supposition does not rest upon\r\nindefinite reasoning, for in our own race we observe that those parts\r\nwhich are gifted with a reproductive power are possessed of the smallest\r\ndegrees of sensation; and the cuticle, the hair, the beard, and the nails\r\nwill even grow after death. This fact may calm the apprehensions of those\r\nvery humane persons who look upon experimental physiologists as very\r\nmonsters of barbarity. Vaillant took out the intestines of a locust, and\r\nstuffed it with cotton, then fixed it down in his box with a pin, yet,\r\nfive months after, the insect moved its feet and antennas. Spallanzani has\r\nshown that the snail can renew its head.\r\n\r\nAll this confusion in theories and wandering of the imagination have\r\narisen from our confounding the vital principle, of which we know nothing,\r\nwith the phenomena of sensation, for which patient and calm investigation\r\nmay account. That there does exist a principle of life that animates,\r\nvivifies, and preserves all living bodies, until its powers cease, no one\r\ncan deny; although to find out its nature is a vain pursuit, as idle as\r\nour endeavours to penetrate into the _causes of causation_. As Richerand\r\nobserves, \"its _essence_ is not designed to preserve the aggregation of\r\nour constituent molecules, but to collect other molecules, which, by\r\nassimilating themselves to the organ that it _vivifies_, may replace those\r\nwhich daily losses carry off, and which are employed in repairing and\r\naugmenting them; the word _vital principle_ is therefore not designed to\r\nexpress a distinct being, but denotes the _totality of powers alone_ which\r\nanimate living bodies, and distinguish them from inert matter, the\r\n_totality of properties_ and _laws_ which govern the animal economy.\"\r\n\r\nOf all the doctrines upon this abstruse subject (of which I have noticed\r\nthe principal ones), that of the pre-existence of an organic germ appears\r\nthe most plausible, or at any rate the easiest to conceive. It was from\r\nthis conviction that the ancients held as an axiomatic principle _Omnia ex\r\novo_. It is upon this theory that Buffon rested his organic molecules, and\r\nRay his vital globules. The primitive lineaments of organization may be\r\ntraced in the egg, even before it is fecundated. The embryo that we find\r\nin its involucra is soft, flexible, ready to receive the plastic\r\nimpression of the vivifying secretion,--the fecundating agency that\r\nimparts existence and all its wondrous attributes, to the pre-existing\r\n_ova_, the _ova subventanea_. It does not appear that the first organ of\r\nthe embryo which exhibits the living principle is the heart, hence\r\ndenominated in the foetus the _punctum saliens_; the principle of life\r\nhas probably organized every molecule of the animal long before this\r\nsupposed fountain of vitality had been seen to flow. It is more likely\r\nthat the nervous system has received the first impressions imparted by the\r\nfecundating secretion, which the ancients supposed to have been a direct\r\nemanation from the brain, and bearing in its vivifying molecules the life\r\nof every part of the being it was about to organize; thus Valescus:\r\n\"Sperma hominibus descendit ex omni corporis humore, qui fit ex subtiliori\r\nnatura. Habet autem hoc sperma nervos et venas proprias attrahentes se a\r\ntoto corpore ad testiculos--a membris disconditur principalibus--a corde,\r\nepate, cerebro mittuntur spiritus, ex quibus resultat spiritus\r\ninformativus, et non aliter nisi cum spermate--ergo ab iis principaliter\r\nsperma disconditur.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the doctrines on this curious subject until the days of\r\nFabricius d'Acquapendente and Harvey. Buffon, however, exerted all his\r\neloquence to revive the theory. The following are the notions of this\r\nelegant writer, who unfortunately only studied natural history in books\r\nand cabinets. He maintains that there exist two sorts of matter,--the one\r\nliving, the other dead: the first enjoying a permanent vitality; the\r\nsecond universally spread, passing from vegetables to animals through the\r\nchannels of nutrition, and returning from animals to vegetables through\r\nthe medium of putrefaction,--thus in a constant state of circulation to\r\nanimate living beings. This vital matter exists in determined quantities\r\nin nature, and is composed of an infinity of organic molecules, primitive,\r\nliving, active, incorruptible, and in relation, both as regards action and\r\nnumbers, with the molecules of light, and enjoying an immutable existence,\r\nsince the usual causes of destruction can only affect their adherence. It\r\nis these molecules which, being cast in regular moulds, constitute all the\r\norganized bodies that surround us. According to this doctrine,\r\n_development_ and _growth_ are only a change of form operated by the\r\naddition of organic molecules; _nutrition_, the preservation of this form\r\nby the accession of fresh molecules that replace those that are destroyed;\r\n_generation_, the combination of these particles; and _death_, their\r\nseparation from cohesion and association.\r\n\r\nThis ingenious system is not dissimilar to that of Maupertuis, who thought\r\nthat the mysteries of generation could be explained by the usual laws of\r\nelective attraction. Various were the physical, metaphysical, and moral\r\nbatteries raised against this visionary fabric. One single fact was\r\nsufficient to overthrow it. We constantly see parents deficient in a limb,\r\nor misshapen, producing perfect offspring; if each part of the economy was\r\nto transmit to its progeniture molecules similar to itself, the child\r\nwould naturally be visited with the imperfection of the parent.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these fallacies, we cannot but admit that chemical and\r\nmolecular attraction constitute the principle that harmonizes all\r\norganized bodies. Generation is simply a function of organization and\r\nlife. Organized bodies alone can generate. The living only can impart\r\nlife. Animals and plants transmit to their descendants their several\r\nproperties; and the inheritance of organization departs with the vital\r\nspark. Life is the property of no one; it is a transmitted heir-loom that\r\nnever perishes; it resembles a torch that communicates an eternal flame\r\nwhile consuming itself. Organized beings have justly been considered the\r\nfuel of the universal vital fire, and we all are the _daily bread_ of that\r\nmonstrous animal called _the world_. All are ingulfed in that vortex which\r\nBeccher has called the \"_circulus aeterni motus_\" Metempsychosis was\r\nsimply an illustration of this fact recognised in all ages in the East,\r\nand taught in European schools by Pythagoras. Nothing perishes; and even\r\ncombustion produces fresh combinations.\r\n\r\nPoetical philosophy has considered _Love_ as the source and arbiter of\r\n_life_, and the _Venus Generatrix_ the fount of our existence. Lucretius\r\nrecognises this power in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    Per te quoniam genus omne animantum\r\n  Concipitur, visitque exortum lumina solis.\r\n\r\nThen again,\r\n\r\n  Omnibus incutiens blandum per pectora amorem,\r\n  Efficis ut cupide generatim saecia propagent.\r\n\r\nVirey, a delightful French physiologist, seems to partake of this\r\nmythological opinion in the following passage: \"L'amour est l'arbitre du\r\nmonde organique; c'est lui qui debrouille le chaos de la matiere, et qui\r\nl'impregne de vie. Il ouvre et ferme a son gre les portes de l'existence a\r\ntous les etres que sa voix appelle du neant, et qu'il y replonge.\r\nL'attraction dans les matieres brutes est une sorte d'amour ou d'amitie\r\nanalogue a celle qui reproduit des etres organises. Ainsi la faculte\r\ngenerative est un phenomene general dans l'univers; elle est representee\r\npar les attractions planetaires et chimiques dans les substances brutes,\r\net par l'amour ou la vie dans les corps organises.\"\r\n\r\nAccording to our amatory neighbours, the word _ame_, or soul, comes from\r\n_amor_ and _amare_, and _amare_ is derived from _animare_; hence\r\n_animation_ and _animal_ may be syllogistically referred to love.\r\n\r\nI know not how far this etymological disquisition may illustrate the\r\nhistory of their _enfans trouves_, or our foundling hospitals, the inmates\r\nof which are generally uncommonly ill favoured by beauty. The offspring of\r\nthe aforesaid Venus Generatrix must have been especially ungrateful; and\r\nif it be true that Julius Caesar was her son, he certainly exerted his best\r\nendeavours to depopulate his mother's territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE HOMOEOPATHIC DOCTRINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a matter worthy of remark, that, while the doctrines of\r\nhomoeopathy have fixed the attention and become the study of many\r\nlearned and experienced medical men in various parts of Europe, England is\r\nthe only country where it has only been noticed to draw forth the most\r\nopprobrious invectives. It is certainly true that no one but an ardent\r\nproselyte of the visionary Hahnemann could for one moment become the\r\nadvocate of all his absurd ideas; yet, while we reject his errors, great\r\nand important truths beam from the chaotic clouds that shroud his\r\nwanderings; and, however wild his theories may be, incontrovertible facts\r\nhave been elicited from his apparently inefficacious practice.\r\n\r\nBefore I enter into an examination of the practical views of the\r\nhomoeopathists, I shall give a brief sketch of their doctrines and of\r\ntheir founder.\r\n\r\nSamuel Hahnemann was born in Meissen in Saxony, on the 10th of April,\r\n1755. His father was an humble porcelain manufacturer. The first rudiments\r\nof education that young Hahnemann received were gratuitous; and his\r\nmaster, pleased with the progress of his ambitious but needy scholar,\r\nstrongly urged him to repair to Leipzig, where, at the age of twenty, he\r\narrived, with exactly the same number of crowns in his pocket as he\r\nnumbered years. At this university he zealously pursued his favourite\r\nstudies of the natural sciences, supporting himself by translating French\r\nworks, and giving lessons; and finally he graduated in the university of\r\nEslan--in 1779.\r\n\r\nIt was during his arduous studies that Hahnemann was struck with the\r\nconflicting systems and the deplorable controversies which for centuries\r\ndivided in turn the medical schools of Europe, and were triumphant or\r\noverthrown by scholastic revolutions; each doctrine being doomed to\r\nobscurity and oblivion in the ratio of its ephemeral splendour. The\r\nresult of his reflections and experiments was the system of homoeopathy.\r\nIts novelty, its apparent absurdity, soon exposed him not only to\r\nopposition, but to violent persecution. As is usual in all cases of\r\noppression, whether justly or unjustly resorted to, proselytes as furious\r\nand as fanatical as his persecutors joined their chief. Despite the\r\nsanatary regulations of Saxony, which prohibited physicians from\r\ndispensing their medicines, Hahnemann prepared and supplied his\r\nhomoeopathic remedies; and, being expelled from Leipzig, sought a refuge\r\nat Koethen, where, exasperated by the harsh treatment he had\r\nexperienced, he fulminated his anathema on all past and present systems of\r\nmedicine with no small degree of furious resentment, pronouncing his\r\ndoctrine to be stamped with the seal of infallibility, and denouncing all\r\nothers as the aberrations of ignorance and error, or the speculations of\r\nimposture and fraud.\r\n\r\nAs might have been expected, few of his opponents thought it worth their\r\nwhile to study his system calmly and dispassionately; nor, indeed, was\r\nsuch an application necessary, for his doctrines needed no deep\r\ninvestigation on the part of his foes, so fraught were they with apparent\r\nerrors and false deductions, not only from his own pretended experience,\r\nbut the experience of ages. Finding that he could not enjoy a despotic\r\nsway over the schools, he was resolved at any rate to seek the palm of\r\nmartyrdom, and had recourse to such violence in words and actions, that\r\nmany of his enemies maintained he was a more fitting subject for a lunatic\r\nasylum than the _soi-disant_ founder of a rational doctrine; for he and\r\nhis fanatical disciples set all ratiocination at nought, considering his\r\n_dixit_ as a fiat of condemnation passed on all who dared to doubt his\r\ninfallibility, although at different periods their oracle was obliged to\r\nretract many erroneous assertions and contradict fallacious statements.\r\n\r\nIn the short view of his doctrines which I am about to give, these\r\nfallacies will become evident.\r\n\r\nHahnemann had observed in his studies and hospital practice that the\r\nprevalent systems of medicine were founded on the rational principle of\r\ncombating effects by striking at morbid causes. Physicians sometimes\r\nendeavoured to attain this desirable end by producing in the system an\r\nartificial action differing from the nature of the malady, and founded\r\ntheir practice on the scholastic axiom of _contraria contrariis curantur_;\r\nat other times they raised or depressed the vital energies according to\r\nthe prevalence of excitement or debility, or modified the character of the\r\ndisease by revulsion and derivation, a practice which received the name of\r\nantagonistic, or _allopathic_,--a term used by Hahnemann in\r\ncontradistinction to homoeopathy, and derived from [Greek: allos],\r\n_different_, and [Greek: pathos], _affection_.\r\n\r\nIn his therapeutic pursuits Hahnemann had been forcibly struck with the\r\nlong-acknowledged fact that medicinal substances supposed to possess a\r\ncertain specific property in the treatment of diseases, were known in the\r\nhealthy subject to produce phenomena bearing a close analogy to the\r\nsymptoms of those identical diseases. Thus, mercurial preparations\r\noccasioned symptoms of syphilis, sulphur produced cutaneous irritation,\r\nand, in some instances, the exhibition of cinchona had been known to bring\r\non febrile intermissions. In various works he found these observations\r\nestablished. For instance, amongst many others, he found in the\r\npublications of Beddoes, Scott, Blair, and various writers, that nitric\r\nacid, which was known to produce ptyalism, relieved salivation and\r\nulceration in the mouth. Arsenic, which, according to Henreich, Knape, and\r\nHeinze, occasioned cancerous anomalies in healthy subjects, was stated by\r\nFallopius, Bernharde, Roennow, and many other surgeons, to be efficacious\r\nin relieving, if not curing, similar disorders; preparations of copper\r\nwere asserted by Tondi, Ramsay, Lazermi, and numerous practitioners, to\r\nhave produced epileptic attacks; and Batty, Baumes, Cullen, Duncan, and\r\nseveral experienced medical practitioners, recommended similar remedies in\r\nepilepsy. In short, the illustrations of the power inherent in certain\r\nsubstances to produce accidents analogous to the symptoms of the various\r\ndiseases in the treatment of which they had proved efficacious, induced\r\nHahnemann to consider whether a treatment founded on _similia similibus\r\ncurantur_ might not be found more effectual than the former practice based\r\nupon the _contraria contrariis_. He was of opinion that no medicine was\r\npossessed of any _curative property_, but solely acted by its _morbific\r\npower_ of producing a disordered condition in the system; and on this and\r\nother principles, which we shall shortly notice, he asserts that nature\r\ndoes not possess any curative power, totally denying the _vis medicatrix_\r\nof the schools. He further maintained, that there does not exist any\r\nspecific malady; but that which we consider to be a disease is nothing but\r\na complexity of symptoms, and that a cure can only be effected when these\r\ncomplex symptoms are made to disappear.\r\n\r\nImpressed with these ideas, he and his disciples proceeded to try various\r\nmedicinal substances upon themselves and others when in health, and,\r\ncarefully recording the symptoms which these medicines produced, they drew\r\nup a statement of their various powers, that they might be afterwards\r\nresorted to, to relieve the same symptoms in a morbid state. Grounding\r\nthis practice on the principle (in many instances correct) that two\r\nsimilar diseases cannot coexist, they conceived that if, to counteract a\r\nnatural malady, one can produce by any medication an artificial\r\nderangement of the same nature, the artificial disorder will overcome the\r\nnatural disease, and a radical cure be obtained. To explain more\r\ndistinctly this idea, I shall quote the author's words.\r\n\r\n\"The curative power of medicines is thus founded on the property they\r\npossess to give rise to symptoms similar to those of the disease, but of a\r\nmore intense power. Hence no disease can be overcome or cured in a\r\ncertain, radical, rapid, and lasting manner, but through the means of a\r\nmedicine capable of provoking a group of symptoms similar to those of the\r\ndisease, and at the same time possessed of a superior energetic\r\npower.\"[31] And further,\r\n\r\n\"If two dissimilar maladies happen to be coexisting, possessed of an\r\nunequal force, or if the oldest disease is more energetic than the recent\r\none, the latter will be expelled by the former. Thus, an individual\r\nlabouring under a severe chronic disease will not be subject to the\r\ninvasion of an autumnal dysentery, or any other slight epidemic. Larrey\r\naffirms that the districts of Egypt in which scurvy was prevalent were\r\nexempt from the plague. Jenner asserts that rachitis prevents the effect\r\nof vaccination; and Hildebrand assures us that phthysical patients never\r\nexperience epidemic fevers unless of the most severe character.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\"If a recent affection, dissimilar to a more ancient one be more powerful\r\nthan the latter, then will the progress of the latter be suspended until\r\nthe malady is either cured or has been expended in its career, and then\r\nthe old one will reappear.\"[33]\r\n\r\n\"But the result is totally different when two similar diseases meet in the\r\norganism; that is to say, when a pre-existing affection is complicated\r\nwith one of the same nature, but possessed of more energy.\"[34]\r\n\r\n\"Two maladies resembling each other in their manifestation and their\r\neffects, that is to say, in the symptoms which they determine, mutually\r\ndestroy each other, the strongest conquering the weakest.\"[35]\r\n\r\nHe further contends that the essential nature of every disease is unknown;\r\nthat their existence is revealed by alterations and changes in the system\r\nperceptible to our senses, and constituting what are called _symptoms_,\r\nand it is the series of these symptoms which characterize the disease in\r\nits course and its development. According to his notions, the physician\r\nhas only to follow and study the succession and the grouping of these\r\nsymptoms; in short, the phases and the phenomena of diseases. Attack and\r\ndestroy these symptoms, and you will have destroyed the malady.\r\n\r\nAll classification of diseases, and their various denominations, he\r\ntherefore deemed absurd, as, according to his doctrines, no one disease\r\nresembles another; so various were their modifications, that, with few\r\nexceptions, it was idle to give them a particular name, since disease was\r\nsimply a derangement in our organization manifested by peculiar symptoms.\r\n\r\nWe are also, according to Hahnemann, ignorant of the essential properties\r\nof medicines, and can only observe and record their effects by\r\nexperimental observation. Like diseases, they also produce a derangement\r\nin our organism, manifested by peculiar symptoms, their sole action\r\nconsisting in developing specific diseases.\r\n\r\nIn conformity with these notions, to cure disease we have only to produce\r\na similar affection; the primitive one would then give way to the\r\nsecondary affection artificially produced, and in time the artificial one\r\nwould cease to exist when the means that produced it were no longer\r\nbrought into action.\r\n\r\nHomoeopathic medicines, he maintained, have the property of acting in a\r\ndirect manner upon the affected part of the system; and this is proved\r\nwhen the disease, and the medicine given to relieve it, produce similar\r\nmorbid manifestations: and he further contended that our vital organism\r\nwas less susceptible of the action of natural affections than of those\r\nwhich are artificially produced.\r\n\r\nOn this basis did the homoeopathic doctrinarians ground their practice;\r\nbut a still more singular theory was broached by their leader; he\r\nmaintained that medicinal substances, to prove efficacious, should be\r\nadministered in an attenuated and diluted state, carried to such an extent\r\nas to become infinite in their division; he further asserts that this\r\ninfinite division, far from diminishing their medicinal power and\r\nproperties, imparts greater energy and certainty of action when these\r\nparticles encounter in our organization an affinity of disposition, or a\r\nhomogeny in action; that is to say, that these atomic attenuations act\r\nwith greater power in those affections which manifest symptoms similar to\r\nthose which these very medicines are known to produce when experimentally\r\ntried upon a healthy subject.\r\n\r\nUpon this principle the homoeopathist condemns all combinations of\r\nmedicines as likely to neutralize each other's properties by their various\r\naffinities; therefore generally speaking, no fresh medicine should be\r\ngiven until the effects of the former have subsided; and to guide this\r\npractice, while they endeavoured to ascertain the symptoms produced by\r\nmedicines, they also sought to ascribe certain limits to the duration of\r\ntheir action: thus, the influence of aconite lasts forty-eight hours, and\r\nthat of crude antimony fifteen days.\r\n\r\nDreading all substances that could tend to weaken or neutralize the effect\r\nof medicine, the homoeopathists made it their particular study to\r\ndiscover the peculiar action of all alimentary substances on the organism,\r\nand characterized as antidotes all such articles of food as they\r\nconsidered opposed to this supposed action: thus, wine and vegetable acids\r\nwere deemed antidotes to aconite; coffee, to Angustura bark; vinegar, to\r\nasarum, &c.\r\n\r\nI have already stated that the homoeopathists conceive that the infinite\r\ndilution of their atoms of medicinal substances increase their energy; and\r\nthis fact they so strenuously maintain, that they assert that accidents of\r\na serious nature may arise when this division is carried too far; and\r\nthese accidents are then to be met with the medicinal antidotes they\r\npretend to have discovered: thus, camphor is an antidote to cocculus;\r\nopium, to the crocus sativus; camomile and camphor, to ignatia amara; and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nThe minuteness with which the specific actions of various medicinal\r\nsubstances on certain organs is detailed is scarcely credible; and the\r\nfollowing extract from the homoeopathic materia medica will give a\r\nslight idea of their industrious labours. Taking as an example phosphorus,\r\nwhich they affirm produces--\r\n\r\nVertigo, determination of blood to the head, headache in the morning, fall\r\nof the hair, difficulty in opening the eyelids, burning sensation and\r\nulceration of the internal canthus of the eye, when exposed to the open\r\nair, lachrymation and adhesion of the palpebrae; inflammation of the eyes,\r\nwith the sensation of particles of sand having been introduced; sparks and\r\nspangles floating before the eyes, a dark tinge in objects that are looked\r\non, diurnal cecity, the appearance of a gray veil drawn before the eyes,\r\npulsation in the ears, epistaxis, mucous discharge from the nostrils,\r\nfoulness of breath, tumefaction of the throat, whiteness of the tongue,\r\nulceration of the mouth, expectoration of glairy mucus, dryness of the\r\nmouth by night and by day, spasmodic eructation, nausea, sense of hunger\r\nafter eating, anxiety after meals; in short, twenty-four octavo pages are\r\ndevoted to the innumerable effects of this substance on the organism.\r\n\r\nOf _magnesia artificialis_ three hundred and twelve symptoms are noted;\r\nsix hundred and fifty of the _rhus radicans_; nine hundred and forty of\r\n_pulsatilla_; five hundred of _ignatia amara_; four hundred and sixty of\r\n_arsenic_: in short, volumes upon volumes are crowded with these\r\nobservations, not only recording physical effects, but singular results on\r\nour moral faculties; such as serenity or moroseness, gaiety or sadness, a\r\ndisposition to commit suicide or a fond partiality to life, courage or\r\ncowardice, a weak intellect or a vigorous conception. For\r\ninstance,--common sea-salt occasions irascibility, lowness of spirits,\r\ntaciturnity, melancholy, palpitation of heart, disposition to shed tears,\r\npusillanimity, and despair; while potash gives rise to ill-temper without\r\napparent cause at noon and in the evening, with violent paroxysms of rage\r\nin the morning, impetuous desires, furious passion, with gnashing of\r\nteeth, if all around does not yield to the patient's desires; while the\r\nvision of a bird hovering about the window produces loud shrieks of alarm,\r\nexaltation of the intellects, and a horror of the future. So innumerable,\r\nindeed, are all these singular effects attributed to various medicines\r\nthus experimented, that no memory, however retentive, could possibly bear\r\nthem in recollection. The following are the directions laid down for\r\nconducting this curious inquiry:\r\n\r\nThe person upon whom medicines are tried must be free from disease; but\r\nweak substances should be given to subjects of a delicate and sensitive\r\nconstitution. The medicine is to be tried in its most pure and simple\r\nstate, possessing all its energies, taking special care that it is not\r\ncombined with any heterogeneous substances during the day it is exhibited,\r\nand the time while its action is supposed to last. The diet must be\r\nmoderate; all spices and high-seasoned food to be avoided, as well as\r\ngreen vegetables, roots, salads, &c. which are known to possess medicinal\r\nproperties. The dose of the medicine to be similar to that which is\r\nusually prescribed by practitioners. If, at the expiration of about two\r\nhours, no effect is observed, a stronger dose is to be given. Should the\r\nfirst dose operate powerfully at the commencement, but gradually lose its\r\ninfluence, the second will be given the following morning; and a still\r\nstronger one, four times the strength of the first, be administered on the\r\nthird day.\r\n\r\nThe result of these experiments being recorded, homoeopathic agents are\r\nselected to oppose morbid symptoms; and when the choice of remedies has\r\nbeen appropriate, an aggravation of the symptoms is observed. This\r\naggravation is usually considered as an increase of the disorder, whereas\r\nit is solely the effect of the homoeopathic remedy. \"For these\r\nphenomena,\" say the homoeopathists, \"were frequently observed by\r\nphysicians, who little thought at the time, that they were the result of\r\nthe medicines they had given.\" Thus, when the pustules of itch became more\r\nrife after the exhibition of sulphur, it was thought that the increase of\r\nthe eruption was merely the affection _coming out_ more freely; whereas,\r\nthe aggravation was occasioned by sulphur. Leroy informs us that the\r\nheart's-ease, _viola tricolor_, increased an eruption in the face. Lyrons\r\nsays that elm-bark aggravated cutaneous affections, which were cured by\r\nthis remedy; but neither of them were aware of the nature of this\r\nhomoeopathic development. For further information on this head, the\r\nOrganon of Hahnemann must be consulted.\r\n\r\nSuch were his doctrines for a period of about twenty years,--doctrines\r\nwhich he emphatically pronounced infallible, and founded on the immutable\r\nlaws of homoeopathy. In 1828, however, convinced by numerous failures in\r\nthe treatment of chronic diseases, that other causes than those which he\r\nacknowledged,--such as the improper preparation of the medicine, or\r\ndietetic neglect on the part of the patient,--contributed to these\r\ndisappointments, he announced that he had discovered the hidden source of\r\nthe obstacles he encountered; and that, after many years of experiments\r\nand meditation, he had come to the conclusion that almost all chronic\r\ndiseases originated from constitutional miasmatic affections or\r\npredispositions, which he divided into _sycosis_, _syphilis_, and _psora_,\r\nor, in plain English, the itch. To this latter affection he attributes\r\ninnumerable disorders. In diseases of a syphilitic character, he had found\r\nhis mode of treatment infallible; and he therefore concluded that all\r\nobstinate and rebellious affections were the result of some other\r\nconstitutional predisposing circumstances. He tells us that he laboured in\r\nprofound secrecy to discover this great, this sublime desideratum: his\r\nvery pupils knew it not; the world was to remain in ignorance of his\r\npursuits until he could proclaim the most inestimable gift that Divinity\r\nbestowed upon mankind. This immortal discovery was neither more nor less\r\nthan the itch; to which malady, according to his views, since the days of\r\nMoses, seven-eighths of the physical and moral miseries to which flesh is\r\nheir, were to be referred. Whether rendered evident by eruptions, or\r\nlatent from our cradle, it was a curse transmitted to us, by the\r\nmodification and degeneration of leprosy, through myriads of\r\nconstitutions, and which only disappears from the surface to fester in\r\nmalignity until it bursts forth again in the multifarious forms of\r\ninnumerable diseases, amongst which we find scrofula, rachitis, phthisis,\r\nhysteria, hypochondriasis, dropsy, hydrocephalus, haemorrhage, fistula,\r\ndiseases of the head and liver, ruptures, cataracts, tic-douloureux,\r\ndeafness, erysipelas, cancers, aneurisms, rheumatism, gout, apoplexy,\r\nepilepsy, palsy, convulsions, stone, St. Vitus's dance, nervous affections\r\nof every description, loss of sight, of smell, of taste, stupidity and\r\nimbecility.[36] In support of this doctrine, Hahnemann adduces ninety-five\r\ncases recorded by medical writers, in which the disappearance of the itch\r\nwas followed by various acute and chronic maladies.\r\n\r\nThe next miasmatic generator is _sycosis_, or the disposition to warty\r\nexcrescences; but this source of disease Hahnemann does not consider so\r\nprolific as syphilis, or his favourite psora.\r\n\r\nSuch are the principal features of the homoeopathic system. I have\r\nalready stated that its followers consider the most minute particles of\r\nmedicine more powerful than larger doses; they therefore have recourse to\r\ninfinite trituration or dilution in three vehicles which they consider\r\nfree from any medicinal property,--distilled water, spirits of wine, and\r\nsugar of milk; by these means they procure a decillionth or a\r\nquintillionth fraction of a grain. One drop of their solution is\r\nconsidered sufficient to saturate three hundred globules of sugar of milk;\r\nand three or four of these globules are deemed a powerful medicine. To\r\ngive a better idea of Hahnemann's notions on this subject, I shall quote\r\nhis own words:\r\n\r\n\"By shaking a drop of medicinal liquid with one hundred drops of alcohol\r\n_once_, that is to say, by taking the phial in the hand which contains the\r\nwhole, and imparting to it a rapid motion by a single stroke of the arm\r\ndescending, I shall then obtain an exact mixture of them; but two or\r\nthree, or ten such movements, would develop the medicinal virtues still\r\nfurther, making them more potent, and their action on the nerves much more\r\npenetrating. In the extenuation of powders, when it is requisite to mix\r\none grain of a medicinal substance in one hundred grains of sugar of milk,\r\nit ought to be rubbed down with force during one hour _only_, in order\r\nthat the power of the medicine may not be carried to too great an extent;\r\nmedicinal substances acquiring at each division or dilution a new degree\r\nof power, as the rubbing or shaking they undergo develops that inherent\r\nvirtue in medicines which was unknown until my time, and which is so\r\nenergetic, that latterly I have been forced by experience to reduce the\r\nnumber of shakes to two.\"\r\n\r\nAs a further illustration of this theory, he affirms that gold is without\r\nany action in our organism in its natural state; but that when one grain\r\nof this metal is triturated according to the above process until each\r\ngrain of the last triturated preparation contains a quadrillionth part of\r\nthe original grain of the mineral, it will be so powerful that it will be\r\nsufficient to place this single grain in a phial, to be inspired for a\r\nmoment, to produce the most amazing results, and none more so than the\r\nfaculty of restoring to a melancholy individual, disposed to commit\r\nsuicide, his pristine partiality to life.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Hahnemann, many of these assertions are unsupported by\r\nfacts or sound reasoning, and appear mere wanderings of an ardent\r\nimagination; and thus soaring in regions of fancy, he himself has struck\r\nmany fatal blows to his own doctrines. For instance, what are the\r\narguments he adduces to prove that in two similar diseases the strongest\r\nwill overcome the weakest?\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" he exclaims, \"does the splendid Jupiter disappear during the\r\ntwilight of morn to the eyes of the contemplator? It is because a similar\r\npower, but possessed of greater energies, the breaking day, acts upon our\r\norgans.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a defective analogy. Hahnemann tells us that a stronger power\r\nbanishes a weaker one in a permanent manner, whereas the bright planet he\r\nhere alludes to will return with the night. Then again:--\r\n\r\n\"With what do we endeavour to relieve the olfactory nerves when offended\r\nby disagreeable odours? By snuff, which affects the nostrils in a similar\r\nbut in a more powerful manner.\" This is not correct: when the action of\r\nsnuff has ceased, the disagreeable effluvia become again offensive. In\r\nsome instances his poetical vagaries are preposterous. \"By what means,\" he\r\nadds, \"do we endeavour to protect the ears of the compassionate from the\r\nlamentations of the poor wretched soldier condemned to be scourged? Is it\r\nnot by the shrill notes of the fife united to the loud beat of the drum?\r\nHow do we endeavour to drown the roar of distant artillery that causes\r\nterror in the heart of the soldier? By the roll of the double drum;--nor\r\nwould this feeling of compassion, this sense of terror, have been checked\r\nby admonition or by splendid rewards. In the same manner our grief, our\r\nregret, subside, upon receiving the intelligence, true or false, that a\r\nmore lively sorrow has affected another person.\" It would be idle to dwell\r\nupon the absurdity of such visions and erroneous statements.\r\n\r\nTo support his doctrines, Hahnemann should have proved, 1st, that\r\nmedicinal powers do produce an artificial malady similar to the natural\r\naffection; 2nd, that the organism only remains under the influence of the\r\nmedicinal disease; 3rd, that this medicinal disease is of short duration;\r\nand 4th, that all these effects can only be produced by a medicine\r\nselected according to their similarity of symptoms. Our theorist has\r\nutterly failed in his endeavours to establish these facts; therefore have\r\nhis doctrines been impugned by many of his most zealous disciples, amongst\r\nwhom may be mentioned Griesselich, Rau, Schroen. The aggravation which he\r\nasserts takes place after the exhibition of a homoeopathic medicine is\r\nnot only unsupported by proof, but positively denied by many of their\r\npractitioners; and Hartman plainly affirms that, after a homoeopathic\r\ndose, the patient frequently experiences a state of calm, a disposition to\r\nslumber, and often falls into a profound sleep more or less prolonged, in\r\nwaking from which he finds himself much relieved, if not perfectly cured.\r\nThus several physicians who have adopted his practical views reject many\r\nof the doctrines on which they are founded; and a homoeopathist has\r\njustly compared his works to a wild virgin forest, in which we meet with a\r\nnumber of valuable trees and plants in the midst of arid brushwood and\r\nparasitic weeds that would check the growth of the most useful\r\nproductions.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding the many gratuitous assertions, and consequent\r\nerroneous inductions, we meet with in the _Organon_, it is probable that\r\nthis system is destined to operate a gradual but material revolution in\r\nthe _practice_ of medicine. As to theories, we must agree with Voltaire\r\nwhen he said \"En fait de systeme, il faut toujours se reserver le droit de\r\nrire le lendemain de ses idees de la veille.\"\r\n\r\nHippocrates laid down in his Aphorisms the incontrovertible fact, \"Duobus\r\ndoloribus simul obortis, non tandem eadem in parte, vehementior alterum\r\nobscurat. A. 46.\" To a certain degree, it was upon this assertion, which\r\nthe experience of ages has confirmed, that Hahnemann founded the principal\r\nand most important point of his doctrine; but, going much farther than the\r\nfather of medicine, he affirms that similar diseases effectually remove\r\neach other. For centuries practitioners have been acting\r\nhomoeopathically; the exhibition of specifics, in fact, being nothing\r\nelse. As we have already shown, specifics are known to produce symptoms\r\nsimilar to the diseases they cure. Hitherto the number of such medicines\r\nhas been confined to a very few agents; and perhaps with the exception of\r\nmercury, sulphur, and bark, with their several preparations, scarcely any\r\narticle in the materia medica could have claimed this peculiar property.\r\nTo extend these limits, which confined in so exiguous a compass our\r\ntherapeutic agents, has been the laborious and singular study of Hahnemann\r\nand his disciples. Haller had first given the example, and they arduously\r\napplied themselves to discover by experiments on the healthy subject, both\r\nupon their own persons and others, what were the peculiar effects or\r\nsymptoms produced by various medicinal substances. These observations are\r\nso numerous and confused, that, on reading them, we feel plunged in a\r\nchaotic labyrinth of symptoms, without any clue to extricate ourselves\r\nfrom its perplexing mazes. Still, from this multifarious catalogue much\r\nimportant information can be collected; and it cannot be denied that the\r\nhomoeopathist has not only thrown a new light on the action of many\r\nmedicines which we daily prescribe, but brought into practical\r\nconsideration the necessity of attending to dietetic discipline, by an\r\ninvestigation of the several properties of our usual _ingesta_.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that any enthusiast who would blindly embrace the foregoing\r\ndoctrines without serious and deep investigation, and boldly apply the\r\nwild theory to practice, would at once throw open the flood-gates of\r\nabsurdity, and lend his aid in destroying, if possible, with one fell\r\nswoop, the result of ages of mature study and experience. Hahnemann, to\r\nfertilize the fields of science, had recourse to inundation instead of\r\nwise and cautious irrigation; and the fury with which he and his rash\r\ndisciples maintained their opinions materially tended to retard their\r\nprogress. Truth needeth not violence; its own lustre will beam through\r\nsurrounding darkness, without being dragged into light.\r\n\r\nThe objections to Hahnemann's doctrines are glaring. The art of healing,\r\nfrom the dawn of science until the present day, has been more or less\r\nfounded on the faculties of reasoning. We are taught, in the first\r\ninstance, to observe carefully the phenomena of disease, and, by referring\r\neffects to probable causes, endeavour, however difficult the task, to\r\ntrace their catenation. Many of these causes are perhaps sealed for ever\r\nin the inscrutable book of our destinies; yet, if we cannot obtain a\r\nknowledge of the origin of these disorders, still when we take into mature\r\nconsideration the complication of all accidental circumstances, and from\r\nvisible effects seek invisible relations, guided by our experience in\r\nanatomy, physiology, and the revelations of pathology, we may find this\r\npursuit less difficult than it may be imagined. But the homoeopathist\r\ndespises and rejects as idle, all those collateral means of diving into\r\nnature's arcana. He bids us dwell only upon evident symptoms, or, in other\r\nwords, look to the effects alone, and cast away all thoughts of\r\ndiscovering their causes. Nothing can be more illogical than this\r\nargument; for certainly we can scarcely hope to remove effects without\r\nstriking, as far as in our power lies, at their cause. To deny the\r\nexistence of any specific affection because we cannot account for its\r\norigin, is absurd. As well might we reject the use of medicines known to\r\npossess specific properties, from our utter ignorance of their _modus\r\noperandi_. The exclusive consideration of symptoms would lead us into\r\nlamentable error, since the same symptoms are observable in various\r\ndiseases. Similar pains, for instance, may be the symptoms of rheumatism,\r\nnephritic affections, and calculus; headaches may arise from inflammation,\r\nand from various and well-known sympathies with distant organs: yet,\r\nwithout seeking to ascertain these relations, the mechanical and\r\nempirical homoeopathist will prescribe such medicines as are known to\r\noccasion pains in the loins, or headaches; only bearing in mind\r\nperceptible derangements, heedless of the phenomena of organization, the\r\nstate of the secretions and excretions, the history, the rise and progress\r\nof the disorder, or the idiosyncrasy of the patient. The liver is\r\ndiseased; the discovery is of no importance. We have only to attend to the\r\npain extending up the clavicle and shoulder, or the uneasiness experienced\r\nin the right hypochondrium: the pulse, the respiration, the condition of\r\nthe excretions, the temperature of the skin, the appearance of the tongue,\r\nare all regarded as minor considerations. It is not _hepatitis_ that we\r\nare called upon to cure; it is to relieve a pain in the shoulder and in\r\nthe hypochondrium, or a difficulty of lying on the left side.\r\n\r\nNo one will pretend to deny that our safest, perhaps our sole, guide in\r\nthe study of disease is the group of symptoms, that become more and more\r\nperceptible during the course of our investigations. It was principally on\r\nthe study of symptoms that the most learned practitioners of every age and\r\ncountry grounded their diagnosis and their prognosis; but they never\r\nviewed them either singly, or in their complexity, as unconnected with the\r\nparticular diseases to which they were not only essentially united, but\r\nfrom which they originated, and of the existence of which they were to be\r\nconsidered the diagnostic signs. Therefore did the ancients classify them\r\nas principal and accessory, univocal and equivocal, characteristic or\r\ncommon, as they afforded more or less information in our pathological\r\ndeduction; and in that light they were weighed with greater or less\r\napplication, as our judgment could only be formed by the attentive\r\nconsideration of the phenomena of the organism in health and in disease.\r\n\r\nBut while the homoeopathist's attention is chiefly directed to the\r\ndiscovery of means that can enable him to produce symptoms analogous to\r\nthose of the disorder, he seems to disregard the laws of sympathy, by\r\nwhich our organism appears to be ruled; a mysterious agency which can only\r\nbe ascertained by observation and experiment, when, to use the words of a\r\ndistinguished writer,[37] \"by the former we may be said to listen to\r\nnature, by the latter to interrogate her.\" Health depends upon the due\r\nco-operation of all these associations; and one organ in the wonderful\r\nmachinery cannot be deranged in its functions without influencing others,\r\nhowever distant and unconnected they may appear. In this co-ordination,\r\nthese vital relations have been very properly divided into mechanical,\r\nfunctional, and sympathetic. Their study constitutes the groundwork of all\r\nrational induction. It is not by individual or complex symptoms that we\r\ncan decide where the want of equilibrium is to be traced. Various have\r\nbeen the theories on this most important subject, and great have been the\r\nerroneous ideas dogmatically laid down. The illustrious Bichat himself\r\nerred when he maintained that sympathies were aberrations--morbid\r\ndevelopments of our vital properties. Sympathies, on the contrary, may be\r\nconsidered as constant phenomena, essential and inseparable from our\r\norganism, whether in health or in sickness; and are, if I may be pardoned\r\nthe expression, co-ordinated to co-operate with each other in their\r\nmechanical, their functional, and their sympathetic associations.\r\n\r\nAn incarcerated hernia causes hiccup, nausea, vomiting. Will the\r\nhomoeopathist tell us that we must seek in his catalogue of innumerable\r\neffects some substance which is known to produce similar symptoms? Surely\r\nthe rupture must first call our attention. This example is adduced as\r\nreferring to nearly every case in which it might be rashly attempted to\r\nseparate causes from effects. The mammary glands are variously affected in\r\nuterine diseases; their impressions are reciprocal, yet the uterine\r\naffection must be the chief object of our solicitude. A peculiar pruritus\r\nis a symptom of calculus. Are we then to administer a homoeopathic dose\r\nof _cannabis_, or any other medicine which may give rise to a similar\r\nsensation? It may be objected to this observation that these are purely\r\nsurgical cases, in which we need not be guided by symptoms to discover\r\ncauses; but it has too frequently happened that nausea and vomiting have\r\nbeen attended to, while the hernia was overlooked, until fatal accidents\r\nwere manifested. Moreover, a diseased liver, a diseased spleen or kidney,\r\nwould be just as perceptible as hernia or calculus, if these parts could\r\nbe brought into view or contact.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that an erroneous notion of Hahnemann's doctrines on this\r\nsubject has been taken; it is therefore necessary to quote his own words:\r\n\r\n\"It may be easily conceived that the existence of a malady presupposes\r\nsome alteration in the interior of the human organism; but our\r\nunderstanding can only lead us to suspect this alteration in a vague and\r\ndeceitful manner, from the appearance of the morbid symptoms, the sole\r\nguide we can depend on except in surgical cases. The essence of the\r\ninternal and invisible change is undiscoverable, nor have we any means of\r\nguarding against deceptive illusions.\"[38]\r\n\r\n\"The invisible substance that has undergone a morbid alteration in the\r\ninterior of the human body, and the perceptible changes, which are\r\nexternally developed,--in other words, symptoms,--form by their union what\r\nis called disease; but the symptoms are the only points of the malady\r\nwhich are accessible to the physician, the sole indication whence he can\r\nderive any intuitive notion, and the principal objects with which he ought\r\nto become acquainted to effect a cure. From this incontestable truth there\r\nis nothing discoverable in disease beyond the totality of its symptoms to\r\nguide us in the selection of our curative means.\"[39]\r\n\r\nIt is not to be supposed that an experienced physician, although a\r\nhomoeopathist, will rest satisfied with this study of symptomatic\r\nmedicine, without endeavouring to attach these effects to some cause,\r\nhowever occult it may appear; but such a doctrine becomes pernicious,\r\nsince it bids us close the only book of truth that can reveal our\r\nerrors,--_post mortem_ investigations. Surely, if a group of certain\r\nsymptoms attend a disease which, when terminating fatally, shows\r\ndisorganization in certain viscera, we are not only justifiable in giving\r\nto that disorganization a specific name in our scientific classification\r\nand categories, but in considering the symptoms of no other importance\r\nthan as corroborative of those facts that morbid anatomy daily brings to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nIt is generally admitted that most nosologies are imperfect, and may\r\noccasionally lead the young practitioner into error. This is easily\r\naccounted for when we consider the Protean forms that the same disease\r\nassumes in different individuals; yet, without this classification, the\r\nscience of medicine could not be studied. A certain arrangement is\r\nnecessary to simplify all our pursuits in natural science, and to seek a\r\nvariety we must know the order and the genus.\r\n\r\nHad Hahnemann given a better system of nosology than those we possess, and\r\nwith his truly praiseworthy zeal and industry enumerated the various\r\nsymptoms of disease as minutely and as accurately as he has recorded the\r\neffects of medicinal substances, his labours might have proved a most\r\nvaluable addition to our store of knowledge.\r\n\r\nLet us now direct our attention to the absurdities to which these opinions\r\nhave led. Solely attentive to effects, and heedless of the\r\ndisorganization of various important parts of the human economy which\r\nmorbid anatomy detects, Hahnemann endeavours to discover the occult\r\ncauses--the original source--the germ--of the malady, which most likely\r\nare beyond the reach of our researches; and he boldly affirms that all\r\nchronic diseases spring from syphilis, a disposition to warts and the\r\nitch. Now experience has proved that such an assumption is unfounded. The\r\nmost healthy subjects, those who attain the finest old age, are more\r\nliable to this disgusting affection than the wealthy and cleanly part of\r\nthe community. The Irish and Scotch peasantry from their infancy, and\r\nthrough life, are most subject to psora; and certainly our soldiers and\r\nsailors, amongst whom the disease is common, are not more predisposed to\r\nchronic diseases than any other classes of society, of course not taking\r\ninto consideration the effects of unhealthy climates.\r\n\r\nSyphilis, it will be readily granted, has a considerable share in\r\nproducing anomalous _sequelae_, more especially when in combination with\r\nmercury. Warts, except of a syphilitic character, were never known to\r\ngerminate diseases; indeed, they affect the most healthy and robust\r\nindividuals. Yet to these three miasmatic causes does Hahnemann attribute\r\nnearly every disease that was ever known to afflict mankind; while he\r\npasses over in silence the predisposition to scrofula, gout, rheumatism,\r\nto which we can unfortunately trace with too much certainty the source of\r\nmuch human misery.\r\n\r\nThat the itch is a disease of great antiquity is a matter of doubt. It has\r\nbeen maintained that it is the same eruptive disorder described by Celsus\r\nunder the appellation of _scabies_; yet this writer does not allude to its\r\ncontagious nature, and moreover says, that in some cases it disappears\r\ncompletely, whereas in others it is renewed at certain periods of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nCelsus, moreover, includes other forms of pustular eruptions among the\r\ndifferent species of scabies, not sufficiently distinguishing them from\r\neach other. The character of his scabies is more analogous to the lichen\r\nagrius of Willan.\r\n\r\nNor did the ancients consider their _psora_ as our itch. It appears to\r\nhave been the scaly tetter, which they sometimes denominated _psoriasis_,\r\nat others _lepra_, a synonymous affection; but neither pustular nor\r\nvesicular. Leprosy, indeed, is a malady totally distinct from the itch in\r\nall its characters. Hahnemann asserts that the species of leprosy that\r\nafflicted the Jews, and which is described by their legislator in the 13th\r\nchapter of Leviticus, was the itch; but any one who will peruse this\r\ndescription will perceive that it does not bear the slightest resemblance\r\nto that disorder. It appears, on the contrary, to have been that kind of\r\nleprosy called _leuce_ by the ancients. Nor was leprosy constantly\r\nattended with itching, one of the chief characteristics of the malady, and\r\nfrom which sensation it derives its very name. Hippocrates mentions a\r\nleprosy that usually occasioned a prurience before rain. There are no\r\ndiseases in the classification of which more obscurity exists than in\r\ncutaneous affections; and Hahnemann's ideas would tend to increase this\r\nconfusion, since he tells us that he considers the _framboesia_ of\r\nAmerica, the _sibbens_ of Norway, the _pellagra_ of Lombardy, the _plica_\r\nof Poland, the _pseudo-syphilis_ of the English, and the _asthenia\r\nVirginiensis_ of Virginia, complications of his three miasmatic\r\nprinciples; and he further informs us, no doubt on the faith of some idle\r\ntradition, that _psora_ lost its external deformity on the return of the\r\nCrusaders, who brought from the Holy Land the use of linen shirts, a\r\ncleanly and salutary precaution that eradicated the disease at a period\r\nwhen France had no less than two thousand hospitals for the reception of\r\n_itch_ patients,--a plain proof that he confounds leprosy with itch, since\r\nthe hospitals he alludes to were distinctly considered leper-houses.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that there does exist in our system a constant\r\npredisposition to eruptive affections of some kind or other. We are born\r\nheirs to certain exanthematic affections, such as the measles and\r\nsmallpox; and it would be as difficult to find a being morally immaculate\r\nas an individual free from speck or blemish. Many of these eruptions are\r\nconsidered of a critical and salutary nature; and the ancients fancied\r\nthat nature relieved herself by throwing upon the surface some \"peccant\r\nhumours.\" Hence their dread of the retrocession of any of these \"breakings\r\nout;\" and there is no doubt but that accidents frequently followed their\r\nsudden disappearance, in the same manner as drying up an issue or a\r\nblister established for some time, and become habitual, may occasion\r\ninternal mischief; but to maintain that all chronic diseases arise from\r\nthree eruptive principles is a most gratuitous and untenable assertion.\r\n\r\nEnthusiastically anxious to support his doctrines, Hahnemann is frequently\r\nled into erroneous assertions. Thus he tells us that life will suddenly\r\ncease if a little water, or the mildest liquid, is injected into a vein;\r\nwhereas experience has proved, in the treatment of cholera, and various\r\nother instances, that the most stimulating solutions may be thus\r\nintroduced, not only with impunity, but with salutary results.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to enter more deeply into the ungracious business of\r\npointing out errors, many of which were evident to Hahnemann himself;\r\nsince, not only in the several editions of his Organon, but in various\r\nparagraphs in the same volume, he contradicts himself.\r\n\r\nA much more gratifying and important task is now undertaken, to prove, by\r\nthe evidence of facts, supported by practical reasoning, that the art of\r\nhealing is more indebted to the homoeopathic doctrines than to any\r\nsystem that has hitherto been delivered in our schools.\r\n\r\nThat the all-bountiful Creator, in permitting, for purposes unknown to us,\r\nmankind to be visited by so many scourges, has also scattered around us\r\nmeans to counteract these evils, cannot be a matter of doubt. Instinct\r\nleads animals to find out these salutary agents, and various specifics\r\nhave been discovered by man. The rudest savage is in possession of\r\ncurative substances unknown to civilized man, and performs cures where\r\nlearning and experience have proved of no avail.\r\n\r\nTo extend the limits of specifics, must therefore be considered a most\r\ndesirable step towards adding to our means of relieving disease; and in\r\nthis pursuit it is impossible to bestow too much praise on the\r\nhomoeopathic observer. Enthusiasm--predilection to a favourite but\r\npersecuted system--may induce an ardent proselyte not only to deceive\r\nothers, but unwittingly to deceive himself. It is therefore not only\r\npossible, but probable, that in the experimental investigations of the\r\neffects of medicine, Fancy, in her multifarious colours, may have\r\ndepicted, with apparent fidelity, a state of body and mind that only\r\nexisted in an excited imagination; but when we behold various individuals,\r\ndistant from each other, and totally unconnected, observing similar\r\nresults from the exhibition of various medicinal substances, we have no\r\nright to call their assertions into doubt. These assertions, moreover, are\r\nnot laid down dogmatically, but are earnestly recommended to be submitted\r\nto the test of experiment. For instance, the homoeopathist has found out\r\nthat certain substances, by diminishing the energy of the heart and\r\narteries, subdue inflammatory action as effectually as venesection. This\r\nis a fact daily witnessed, and of which any practitioner may convince\r\nhimself. It is not asserted, that in cases of sudden determination of\r\nblood, which require immediate revulsion and abstraction of the vital\r\nfluid, homoeopathic remedies will be found possessed of sufficient\r\nactivity to afford prompt relief; but experience has fully proved that in\r\ncases which can admit of a few hours' delay, these medicines very\r\nfrequently supersede the necessity of debilitating the patient by a\r\ncopious loss of blood.\r\n\r\nDr. Paris, in his admirable work on Materia Medica, has justly observed,\r\n\"that observation or experiment upon the effects of medicine is liable to\r\na thousand fallacies, unless it be carefully repeated under the various\r\ncircumstances of _health_ and _disease_, in different climates, and on\r\ndifferent constitutions.\" This has been the main object of the\r\nhomoeopathist; and a further quotation from the above distinguished\r\nwriter will illustrate the importance of their labours. \"It is impossible\r\nto cast our eyes over such multiplied groups (of medicinal substances)\r\nwithout being forcibly struck with the palpable absurdity of some, the\r\ndisgusting and loathsome nature of others, the total want of activity in\r\nmany, and the uncertain and precarious reputation of _all_, without\r\nfeeling an eager curiosity to inquire, from the combination of what causes\r\nit can have happened that substances at one period in the highest esteem,\r\nand of generally acknowledged utility, have fallen into total neglect and\r\ndisrepute. That such fluctuation in opinion and versatility in practice\r\nshould have produced, even in the most candid and learned observer, an\r\nunfavourable impression with regard to the general efficacy of medicines\r\ncan hardly excite our astonishment, much less our indignation; nor can we\r\nbe surprised to find that another portion of mankind has at once arraigned\r\nphysic as a fallacious art, or derided it as a composition of error and\r\nfraud. A late foreign writer, impressed with this sentiment, has given the\r\nfollowing _flattering_ definition of our profession: _Physic is the art\r\nof amusing the patient, while Nature cures his disease_.\"\r\n\r\nWith such a lamentable view of the practice of medicine, can we be too\r\nthankful to those observers who strenuously endeavour to rescue it from\r\nthe dark trammels in which prejudice and interested motives have bound it?\r\nIn no country more than in Great Britain is such an investigation\r\ndesirable. We have become proverbial from our incessant abuse of a farrago\r\nof medicinal substances; and what is usually termed an _elegant\r\nprescription_ signifies an amalgam of various drugs and preparations,\r\nwhich most probably, by their affinities, neutralize the expected effects\r\nof each other; for, however great and flattering may have been the\r\ndiscoveries of modern chemistry, many of these affinities are unknown to\r\nus. Surely when our labours cannot detect any difference in the component\r\nparts of the purest Alpine atmosphere and the deleterious air of a\r\nloathsome dungeon, we cannot expect to form a correct idea of pharmaceutic\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThe mere hopes of being able to relieve society from the curse of constant\r\ndrugging, should lead us to hail with gratitude the homoeopathist's\r\ninvestigations. That many physicians, but especially apothecaries, who\r\nlive by overwhelming their patients with useless and too frequently\r\npernicious medicines, will warmly, nay furiously inveigh against any\r\ninnovation of the kind, must be expected as the natural result of\r\ninterested apprehension; and any man who aims at simplicity in practice\r\nwill be denounced as guilty of medical heresy. Have we not seen\r\ninoculation and vaccination branded with the most opprobrious epithets,\r\nmerely because their introduction tended to diminish professional lucre?\r\n\r\nIn these remarks upon medicinal combinations, it is not meant to infer,\r\nthat, because they are chemically incompatible, they are\r\nineffectual,--experience has proved the contrary; but no one will contend\r\nthat, if we can attain the same beneficial results from a single\r\ningredient, administered in small quantities and at distant periods, as\r\nfrom the exhibition of repeated and nauseous doses of pills, powders,\r\ndraughts, potions, &c. which hang over the bed of sickness, nay, of slight\r\nderangements, like the sword of Damocles, we have not effected a most\r\nsalutary reform in the practice of physic. It is related of one of these\r\ningenious and industrious practitioners, that, having seen a prescription,\r\nthat only contained half a dozen medicines, he exclaimed, \"What! nothing\r\nmore?\" To which the prescriber replied, \"If you choose, sir, we'll step\r\nover to the apothecary, and see what else he has in his shop.\"\r\n\r\nSpecifics may be divided into two classes; the one producing a peculiar\r\neffect upon particular organs, the other producing general results. Thus,\r\nthe action of cantharides and digitalis on the urinary system, of emetics\r\non the stomach, of certain purgatives on the small intestines, and of\r\nothers on the large ones, are generally known; whereas the action of\r\nmercury and opium is still a matter of controversy. A study of these\r\neffects constitutes the chief object of the homoeopathist; and, having\r\ndetermined their peculiar action, these medicinal agents are given\r\nsingly, and, as we have already observed, in the most minute doses.\r\n\r\nIt is this division into infinite fractions that has drawn upon the\r\nhomoeopathic practice the denunciation of the allopathic physicians, as\r\nit is considered utterly impossible that such imponderable particles can\r\nproduce any beneficial or prejudicial effect; and the Academy of Medicine\r\nof Paris, when officially condemning the doctrine, asserts, in support of\r\nthis argument, that great danger arises from it \"in frequent and serious\r\ncases of disease, where the physician may do as much injury, and cause no\r\nless mischief, by ineffectual means as by those which are prejudicial.\"\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps one of the most important points of the homoeopathic\r\ndoctrine. If these fractional doses are inert, and yet the disease is\r\ncured, then must the successful treatment be solely ascribed to the\r\ndietetic regimen and the efforts of nature. However, experience has\r\nafforded abundant proofs that these infinite atoms do produce positive and\r\nevident effects. What appears to our feeble organs an atomic fraction may\r\nproduce phenomena on the organism which we cannot comprehend, but should\r\nnot therefore be denied. Let one grain of iodine be dissolved in one\r\nthousand five hundred and sixty grains of water, the solution will be\r\nlimpid; let two grains of starch be dissolved in two ounces of water and\r\nadded to the first solution, and the liquor will forthwith assume a blue\r\ntint. In this experiment the grain of iodine has been divided into\r\n1/15360. Dissolve the four-hundredth part of one grain of arsenic in four\r\nhundred thousand parts of water, and the hydric-sulphite will bring it\r\ninto evidence. Let a five-thousandth part of arseniate of ammonia be\r\ndissolved in five hundred thousand parts of water, and the addition of the\r\nsmallest proportion of nitrate of silver will obtain a yellow precipitate.\r\nNumerous experiments of a similar nature may be daily resorted to, to\r\nprove that the most minute particles of two substances possessed of\r\nchemical affinities may be brought into action, although diluted _ad\r\ninfinitum_. But the power that the smallest particle possesses in\r\nproducing natural phenomena cannot be more evidently proved than by\r\nSpallanzani's experiments in fecundation. This physiologist having wrapped\r\nup a male frog in oil-silk, fecundation could not take place; but having\r\ncollected on the point of a camel-hair pencil a particle of the\r\nfecundising fluid, he succeeded in vivifying thousands of eggs. Surprised\r\nat this result, he dissolved three grains of the secretion in a pound of\r\nwater, and one globule of the solution was endowed with the same faculty.\r\nIn this case the globule of water only contained 1/2994687500 part of one\r\ngrain. This curious experiment has been tried with a similar result by\r\nPrevost and Dumas. How imponderable and impalpable must be the effluvium\r\nwhich enables the dog to track his master for miles! the particle of atter\r\nof roses that perfumes a whole chest of clothes! and what must the power\r\nof the aroma be which is preserved for thousands of years in some Egyptian\r\nmummies! Would the vulgar believe in the wonders of the solar and gaseous\r\nmicroscopes unless they were exposed to view? In these we behold in\r\namazement myriads of individuals in one drop of fluid, each of them as\r\nperfect in organization as the mighty mammoth of old or the sagacious\r\nelephant of our days, endowed with distinct habits, destructive and\r\nreproductive propensities and faculties.\r\n\r\nIt has been advanced by the opponents of homoeopathy that the\r\ninsignificant dose of three or four medicinal globules cannot possess any\r\npower, since one might swallow a thousand of them with impunity. To this\r\nit is answered, that it is only under certain morbid conditions that these\r\nmedicines act by their homoeopathic affinities. Moreover, it is well\r\nknown that small doses of medicinal substances will frequently produce\r\nmore powerful effects than larger quantities. Tartar-emetic, sugar of\r\nlead, calomel, afford daily instances of this fact; and it is also\r\nadmitted that many substances act differently upon the healthy or the\r\nsick. An individual in health can take any food without apprehension; but\r\nwhen his functions are deranged, the slightest imprudence in regimen may\r\nlead to serious consequences. There are primordial and inscrutable\r\npeculiarities in our constitution that cannot be accounted for; and the\r\nmedicine which relieves one patient will aggravate the sufferings of\r\nothers. The exhalations of the American _rhus_ are deadly to some persons,\r\nbut innocuous to others; and many poisons which cause instantaneous death\r\nto some animals may be given with safety to others. Whence has arisen the\r\ncontroversy regarding damp sheets, which many maintain are not dangerous,\r\nsimply from the fact that a healthy person with a vigorous circulation may\r\nsleep in them with impunity, when a feeble and languid subject will be\r\nexposed to some dangerous determination of blood?\r\n\r\nA learned writer already quoted thus expresses himself on this\r\nmatter:[40] \"The virtues of medicines cannot be fairly nor beneficially\r\nascertained by trying their effects on sound subjects, because the\r\npeculiar morbid condition which they are calculated to remove does not\r\nexist.\" It may be said that this observation militates against the\r\nhomoeopathic experiments, and to a certain extent it evidently does; but\r\nit cannot be inferred that because a medicinal substance will occasionally\r\nact differently in health and in disease, that it may not frequently\r\noperate in a similar manner when the morbid condition does prevail, since\r\nit is generally admitted that medicines act in a relative manner according\r\nto the state of the system. Hence classifications of medicines are too\r\nfrequently erroneous and imperfect. The doses of medicines determine their\r\neffects. Linnaeus says, \"Medicines differ from poisons, not in their\r\nnature, but in their dose;\" and Pliny tells its aphoristically, \"_Ubi\r\nvirus, ibi virtus_.\" According to their doses, medicines will produce a\r\ngeneral or a local effect; and Dr. Paris, whom I feel much gratification\r\nin quoting, lays down as a rule that \"substances perfectly inert and\r\nuseless in one dose may prove in another active and valuable.\" It would be\r\nforeign to my purpose to enter more fully into this most important\r\nsubject; but the cases which shall be adduced will be deemed sufficient to\r\nconvince the most incredulous, of the power of homoeopathic doses.\r\n\r\nThose who have denied this property have boldly attributed homoeopathic\r\ncures to dietetic means. Admitting this statement by way of argument,\r\nsurely, if any observer, by ascertaining the peculiar action of our\r\ningesta, can so regulate the regimen as to produce salutary effects\r\nwithout the aid of medicine, mankind would be most essentially benefited.\r\nHow many persons do we not daily meet with, who have never taken any\r\nmedicine since their childhood, when maternal care strove to destroy their\r\ndigestive organs with apothecary's _stuff_, and who regulate their\r\nfunctions by mere attention to their mode of living. I know one gentleman,\r\na physician, who relieves constipation by green chilies; another, with\r\ncold milk; a third, with warm milk: in some habits spinach and sorrel will\r\nact as a powerful and safe aperient; in others, cheese, or a hard egg,\r\nwill operate in a contrary way. Fermented and spirituous liquors all\r\npossess specific properties. Some gouty persons cannot drink Claret\r\nwithout bringing on a paroxysm, and others dread a glass of Champagne or\r\nBurgundy. Nay, different wines have been known to bring on arthritic\r\nattacks in particular parts; and I have known Champagne to produce gout in\r\nthe wrist, and Burgundy in the knee, in subjects who under other\r\ncircumstances never experienced the disorder in those articulations. Our\r\npeculiar aversion, nay, our dread, of various alimentary substances are\r\nwell known. The odour of cheese, of strawberries, have occasioned fainting\r\nand convulsions; and in certain constitutions, several articles of diet\r\nbring on indigestion. In short, the study of our ingesta is one of the\r\ngreatest importance; and here again the homoeopathist is entitled to our\r\nbest thanks.\r\n\r\nThis investigation will moreover prompt physicians to be more attentive in\r\ninquiring into the various effects of alimentary and medicinal substances\r\non their patients. Instead of hastily drawing out routine prescriptions\r\nfor such and such a disorder, they will accurately ascertain the physical\r\nand moral condition of the subject, taking into due consideration previous\r\nhabits, predispositions, and pursuits in life. Indeed, it would be\r\ndesirable that practitioners followed the example of army medical men, who\r\nkeep an exact register of every individual they attend, and in which is\r\ndiligently recorded every circumstance connected with the disease and its\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nMoral influence has also been called into aid in opposition to this\r\npractice, and cures have been attributed to the mere power of fancy and\r\ncredulity. We have certainly known superstition and mental imbecility to\r\nbe productive both of good and evil,--to have created some maladies, and\r\ncured others; but homoeopathy has succeeded when the patient was unaware\r\nof the treatment to which he was submitted. But, conceding the point, and\r\nadmitting that inert substances, such as starch, (and this experiment was\r\nresorted to in Paris,) may have obtained singular beneficial results,--the\r\nresults of a weak imagination, this circumstance alone would be\r\nillustrative of the power of moral agency; and who would not gladly wish\r\nfor a mental relief in lieu of a nauseating and injurious course of\r\nmedicine?\r\n\r\nOthers will exclaim, although the homoeopathist disavows the _vis\r\nmedicatrix naturae_, that he solely succeeds by leaving the malady to the\r\nsalutary efforts of the constitution. Here again we must admit, that, were\r\nwe to leave many diseases to run their course, we might be more successful\r\nin obtaining a cure than by a rash and detrimental interference, founded\r\non the principle that a physician \"must order something.\"\r\n\r\nBut the facts I am about to record,--facts which induced me, from having\r\nbeen one of the warmest opponents of this system, to investigate carefully\r\nand dispassionately its practical points,--will effectually contradict all\r\nthese assertions regarding the inefficacy of the homoeopathic doses, the\r\ninfluence of diet, or the agency of the mind; for in the following cases\r\nin no one instance could such influences be brought into action. They were\r\n(with scarcely any exception) experiments made without the patient's\r\nknowledge, and where no time was allowed for any particular regimen. They\r\nmay, moreover, be conscientiously relied upon, since they were made with a\r\nview to prove the fallacy of the homoeopathic practice. Their result, as\r\nmay be perceived by the foregoing observations, by no means rendered me a\r\nconvert to the absurdities of the doctrine, but fully convinced me by the\r\nmost incontestable facts that the introduction of fractional doses will\r\nsoon banish the farrago of nostrums that are now exhibited to the manifest\r\nprejudice both of the health and the purse of the sufferer.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE I.\r\n\r\nA servant-maid received a blow of a stone upon the head. Severe headache,\r\nwith dizziness and dimness of sight, followed. Various means were resorted\r\nto; but general blood-letting could alone relieve the distressing\r\nsymptoms, local bleeding not having been found of any avail. The relief,\r\nhowever, was not of long duration, and the distressing accidents recurred\r\nperiodically, when abstraction of blood became indispensable. Reduced by\r\nthese frequent evacuations, I was resolved to try the boasted \"bleeding\r\nglobules\" of the homoeopathist, when, to my great surprise, I obtained\r\nthe same mitigation of symptoms which the loss of from twelve to sixteen\r\nounces of blood had previously accomplished. Since the first experiment no\r\nvenesection became necessary, and the returns of the violent headache were\r\ninvariably relieved by the same means.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE II.\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman was subject to excruciating headache, with an evident\r\ndetermination of blood to the brain. Numerous leeches were constantly\r\napplied. The usual remedies indicated in similar affections were resorted\r\nto, but only afforded temporary relief. A homoeopathic dose of aconite\r\nwas given, and the relief that followed was beyond all possible\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE III.\r\n\r\nMy much-esteemed friend Dr. Grateloup of Bordeaux was subject to frequent\r\nsore-throats, which were only relieved by local blood-letting, cataplasms,\r\n&c., but generally lasted several days, during which deglutition became\r\nmost difficult. I persuaded him to try a dose of the belladonna, neither\r\nof us having the slightest confidence in its expected effects. He took the\r\nglobules at twelve o'clock, and at five P.M. the tumefaction of the\r\ntonsils, with their redness and sensibility, had subsided to such an\r\nextent that he was able to partake of some food at dinner. The following\r\nmorning all the symptoms, excepting a slight swelling, had subsided.\r\n\r\nSince this period Dr. G. has repeatedly tried the same preparation in\r\nsimilar cases, and with equal success. In my own practice, I can record\r\nseven cases of cynanche tonsillaris which were thus relieved in the course\r\nof a few hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE IV.\r\n\r\nH--, a young woman on the establishment of the Countess of --, was\r\nsuffering under hemiplegia, and it was resolved by Dr. Brulatour and\r\nmyself to try the effects of nux vomica. At this period the wonders of the\r\nhomoeopathic practice had been extolled to the skies by its advocates,\r\nand we were resolved to give one of their supposed powerful preparations a\r\nfair trial. The girl was told that the powder she was about to take was\r\nsimply a dose of calomel; and on calling upon her the following morning we\r\ndid not expect that the slightest effect could have been obtained by this\r\natomic dose, when, to our utter surprise, the patient told us that she had\r\npassed a miserable night, and described to us most minutely all the\r\nsymptoms that usually follow the exhibition of a large dose of strychnine.\r\nIt is but fair to mention that the homoeopathic treatment did not cure\r\nthe disease; but the manifest operation of this fractional dose, that\r\ncould not possibly be denied, is a fact of considerable importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE V.\r\n\r\nMrs. ---- of Brompton, Bow, had laboured under hectic fever for several\r\nmonths, and was so reduced by night perspirations, that she was on the\r\nvery brink of the grave. Called into consultation, I frankly told her\r\nhusband that every possible means known in the profession had been most\r\njudiciously employed, and that I saw no prospect of obtaining relief. At\r\nthe same time I mentioned to him that the homoeopathic practitioners\r\npretended that they had found the means of relieving these distressing\r\nsymptoms, which he might submit to an experimental trial if he thought\r\nproper. He immediately expressed his wish that it should be adopted. I\r\ngave her a homoeopathic dose of phosphoric acid and stannum; and, to the\r\nsurprise of all around her, the night sweats did not break out at their\r\nusual hour,--three o'clock in the morning. What renders this case still\r\nmore interesting is the fact of these perspirations recurring so soon as\r\nthe action of the medicine ceased; a circumstance so evidently\r\nascertained, that the patient knew the very day when another dose became\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASE VI.\r\n\r\nA daughter of the same lady was subject to deafness, which I attributed to\r\na fulness of blood. This cause I clearly ascertained by the relief\r\nafforded by the application of a few leeches behind the ear. I was\r\ntherefore induced, on a recurrence of the complaint, to endeavour to\r\ndiminish vascular action by a dose of aconite. The effects were evident in\r\nthe course of four hours, when the deafness and the other symptoms of\r\nlocal congestion had entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI could record numerous instances of similar results, but they would of\r\ncourse be foreign to the nature of this work. I trust that the few cases I\r\nhave related will afford a convincing proof of the injustice, if not the\r\nunjustifiable obstinacy, of those practitioners who, refusing to submit\r\nthe homoeopathic practice to a fair trial, condemn it without\r\ninvestigation. That this practice will be adopted by quacks and needy\r\nadventurers, there is no doubt; but homoeopathy is a science on which\r\nnumerous voluminous works have been written by enlightened practitioners,\r\nwhose situation in life placed them far above the necessities of\r\nspeculation. Their publications are not sealed volumes, and any medical\r\nman can also obtain the preparations they recommend. It is possible, nay,\r\nmore than probable, that physicians cannot find time to commence a new\r\ncourse of studies, for such this investigation must prove. If this is the\r\ncase, let them frankly avow their utter ignorance of the doctrine, and not\r\ndenounce a practice of which they do not possess the slightest knowledge.\r\n\r\nDespite the persecution that _Hahnemannism_ (as this doctrine is\r\nironically denominated) is at present enduring, every reflecting and\r\nunprejudiced person must feel convinced that, although its wild and\r\nuntenable theories may not overthrow the established systems (if any one\r\nsystem can be called established), yet its study and application bid fair\r\nto operate an important revolution in medicine. The introduction of\r\ninfinite small doses, when compared, at least, with the quantities\r\nformerly prescribed, is gradually creeping in. The history of medicine\r\naffords abundant proofs of the acrimony, nay, the fury, with which every\r\nnew doctrine has been impugned and insulted. The same annals will also\r\nshow that this spirit of intolerance has always been in the _ratio_ of the\r\ntruths that these doctrines tended to bring into light. From the preceding\r\nobservations, no one can accuse me of having become a blind bigot of\r\nhomoeopathy; but I can only hope that its present vituperators will\r\nfollow my example, and examine the matter calmly and dispassionately\r\nbefore they proceed to pass a judgment that their vanity may lead them to\r\nconsider a final sentence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOCTRINE OF SIGNATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most absurd medical doctrines that ever prevailed in the dark\r\naeras of science was the firm belief that all medicinal substances\r\ndisplayed certain external characters that pointed out their specific\r\nvirtues. This curious theory may be traced to the Magi and Chaldaeans, who\r\npretended that every sublunary body was under a planetary influence. To\r\nfind the means of concentrating or fixing this stellary emanation became a\r\ncabalistic study, called by Paracelsus the \"_ars signata_;\" and talismans\r\nof various kinds were introduced by the professors of sideral science. The\r\nword talisman appears to be derived from the Chaldaean and Arabic\r\n_tilseman_ and _tilsem_, which mean characteristic figures or images.\r\n\r\nParacelsus, Porta, Crollius, and many other philosophers and physicians,\r\ncherished this vision, which had been transmitted to them through the\r\ndense mists of superstition from more ancient authorities; amongst\r\nothers, Dioscorides, Aelius, and Pliny.\r\n\r\nThe _lapis aetites_, or eagle-stone, which was supposed to be found in the\r\nnests of this bird, but which, in fact, is nothing more than a variety of\r\niron-ore, was said to prevent abortion if tied to the arm, and to\r\naccelerate parturition if affixed to the thigh. This conceit arose from\r\nthe noise that seemed to arise from the centre of the stone when it was\r\nshaken: \"Aetites lapis agitatus, sonitum edit, velut ex altero lapide\r\npraegnans.\" From this absurd hypothesis sprung the doctrine; and the very\r\nnames of plants were supposed to indicate their specific qualities. For\r\ninstance, the _euphrasia_, or eye-bright, exhibiting a dark spot in its\r\ncorolla, resembling the pupil of the eye, was considered efficacious in\r\naffections of that organ. The blood-stone, the _heliotropum_, from its\r\nbeing marked with red specks, was employed to stop haemorrhage; and is to\r\nthis day resorted to in some countries, even in England, to stop a\r\nbleeding from the nose.[41] Nettle-tea was prescribed for the eruption\r\ncalled _nettle-rash_. The _semecarpus anacardium_, bearing the form of a\r\nheart, was recommended in the diseases of this viscus. The _cassuvium\r\noccidentale_, resembling the formation of a kidney, was prescribed in\r\nrenal complaints; and the pulmonary lichen of the oak, the _sticta\r\npulmonaria_, from its cellular structure, was esteemed a valuable\r\nsubstance in morbid affections of the lungs. Deductions still more absurd,\r\nif possible, are recorded: thus saxifrage, and other plants that grow in\r\nrocky places, embodied as if it were in calcareous beds, were advised to\r\ndissolve the stone; and the _echium_, bearing some faint resemblance to a\r\nviper, was deemed infallible in the sting inflicted by this reptile. The\r\ndivers colours of substances supposed to be medicinal were also another\r\n_signature_. Red flowers were given for derangement in the sanguiferous\r\nsystem, and yellow ones for those of the bile. In Crollius's work,\r\nentitled \"_De Signaturis Plantarum_,\" many curious observations may be\r\nfound; and Sennert, Keuch, Dieterich, and other writers displayed great\r\nindustry in the division of these signatures, which, by the ancients, were\r\nconsidered as something denoting no particular quality, and were then\r\ncalled [Greek: asemoi charakteroi]; or [Greek: semantikoi], when their\r\nvirtues were evident.\r\n\r\nAmongst the various influences and indications that were attributed to\r\ncolours, black was especially considered as the mark of melancholy.\r\nBaptista Porta affirms, that if a \"black spot be over the spleen, or in\r\nthe nails, it signifies much care, grief, contention, and melancholy.\"\r\nCardan assures us that a little before his son's death he had a black\r\nspot, which appeared in one of his nails, and dilated itself as he\r\napproached his end.\r\n\r\nWhile nature was thus supposed to mark the virtues of her productions on\r\ntheir external configuration, man assumed the same authoritative power,\r\nand marked medicines with certain signs or seals. For this purpose, the\r\nancient physicians carried signets or rings, frequently worn upon the\r\nthumb, and on which were engraved their own names, sometimes written\r\nbackwards, or the denominations of the nostrums they vended. On one of\r\nthese seals we find the word _aromaticu_, from _aromaticum_; on another,\r\n_melinu_, abbreviation of _melinum_,--a collyrium prepared with the alum\r\nof the island of Melos. A seal of this kind is described by Tochon\r\nd'Annecy, bearing the words _psoricum crocodem_, an inscription that has\r\npuzzled medical antiquaries. The word _psoricum_ was applied to an\r\neruptive affection of the eye; and Actuarius mentions a _collyrium\r\npsoricum_ of Aelius; while Marcellus Empiricus records the virtues of the\r\n_psoricum stratioticum_, which restored sight in twenty days to a patient\r\nwho had been blind for twelve years; but, when it was applied, it was\r\nineffectual, unless the words \"_Te nunc resunco, bregan gresso_,\" were\r\nreligiously pronounced. _Crocodem_ was also supposed to apply to _crocus_\r\nor saffron, or to _crocodes_, a remedy for sore eyes, mentioned by Galen;\r\nwhile some learned men refer the word to the dejections of the crocodile,\r\nwhich were said to possess various virtues. The earth of Lemnos was sealed\r\nwith the figure of Diana, and to this day the bolar argils, brought from\r\nGreece, bear various seals and characters; hence the _bolus Armeniae_, and\r\n_bolus ruber_, are called _terra sigillata_.\r\n\r\nThe influence of colours was supposed to have been so great, that in our\r\nown annals we find John de Gaddesden, mentioned by Chaucer, ordering the\r\nson of Edward I., when labouring under the small-pox, to be wrapped up in\r\nscarlet; and to the present day, flannel, died nine times blue, is\r\nsupposed to be most efficacious in glandular swellings. Tourtelle, a\r\nFrench army physician, has made the following singular observation on this\r\nsubject: \"I observed that those soldiers of the Republic who were affected\r\nwith diseases connected with transpiration were more severely indisposed,\r\nand not unfrequently exhibited symptoms of putrescency, when their wet\r\nclothes had left a blue tinge on the skin, than when they had been merely\r\nwetted by the rain.\" The explanation of this supposed phenomenon, is\r\nsimply that those men who had been coloured by their uniforms, had, no\r\ndoubt, been long wearing them, saturated by incessant rains, whereas the\r\nothers had merely been exposed to occasional showers. From this\r\nobservation, I do not pretend to affirm that any deleterious substances in\r\na dye might not occasion a dangerous absorption; but the accidents that\r\nmay result from such a circumstance could be easily explained without\r\nhaving recourse to any particular influence of colour. The colour of\r\ncloth, especially in army clothing, may also materially tend to influence\r\ncutaneous transpiration, as some colours are more powerful conductors of\r\nheat than others; and it is not impossible that the French soldiers, not\r\nbelonging to fresh levies, and who had always been clad in white, might\r\nhave experienced some difference of temperature when marching under\r\nintense heat in dark blue and green uniforms.\r\n\r\nSome of the terms used by the signature doctrinarians may puzzle the most\r\nlearned. The Greeks called them [Greek: semantika]; and, in addition to\r\nthe all-powerful _abracadabra_,--an infallible cure of ague, when\r\nsuspended round the neck,--we find the magic terms of _sator_, _asebo_,\r\n_tenet_, _obera_, _rotas_, _abrac_, _khiriori_, _gibel_, engraved upon\r\namulets. For the bite of a mad dog, _pax max_, and _adimax_, were\r\nirresistible; and for a fractured arm or a luxation, _araries_,\r\n_dandaries_, _denatas_, and _matas_, would have set at defiance the most\r\nexperienced chirurgeons. I must refer the curious reader on this important\r\nsubject to the work _De figuris Persarum Talismanicis_ of Guffarel, to the\r\n_Oedipus_ of Kircher, the book of Crollius _De signaturis internis\r\nrerum_, and _Isagoge physico-magico-medica_ of Elzer.\r\n\r\nThe church vehemently denounced these abominations; and we find in the\r\ncouncil of Laodicea an injunction forbidding the priesthood the study and\r\npractice of enchantment, mathematics, astrology, or the binding of soul by\r\namulets. These incantations were dreaded in every age. Thus Lucan:\r\n\r\n  Mens, hausti nulla sanie polluta veneni,\r\n  Incantata perit.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have justly observed that most of the diseases treated and\r\nsupposed to have been cured by these mystic means, were of a nervous\r\ndescription, and therefore depending, in a great measure, upon moral\r\ninfluence. Here faith and hope assisted the physicians,--two great\r\nauxiliaries in every worldly turmoil and trouble. Therefore do we find\r\nmost of these cures referred to epilepsy, paralysis, melancholy,\r\nhypochondriasis, hysteria, as well as to many periodical affections, the\r\nreturn of which is frequently arrested by mental impressions. A fright has\r\nchecked the paroxysm of an intermittent fever; and many natural functions\r\nare impeded or brought on by a similar agency. The sight of a dentist has\r\nbeen often known to calm an excruciating toothache; and there is no\r\ncomplaint that has been cured by more singular means than this troublesome\r\naffection. In 1794, a tract was published in Florence by Dr. Ranieri\r\nGerbi, a professor of mathematics in Pisa, entitled _Storia naturale di un\r\nnuovo insetto_, which he called _curculio anti-odontalgicus_, and which,\r\nbeing squeezed between the fingers, imparted to them, for the period of\r\none year, the wonderful power of relieving toothache with the mere touch;\r\nand the author asserts that by this simple process he cured four hundred\r\nand one cases out of six hundred and twenty-nine. This may be considered a\r\nbranch of magnetism, and has been treated by Schelhammar, in his book _De\r\nOdontalgia tactu sedanda_.\r\n\r\nThis wonderful insect belonged to the _coleoptera_, and was simply the\r\n_curculio_ and the _coccinella septem-punctata_, well known to\r\nentomologists, and which, according to Cipriani Zuccagni, and more\r\nparticularly Carradori, possessed these singular properties, which,\r\nhowever, subsequent experiments have fully disproved.\r\n\r\nWhile we find some _charms_ having sufficient power over our weak\r\nimagination to cure diseases, there were others considered sufficiently\r\nenergetic to occasion death. Sometimes a wax figure was made, supposed to\r\nrepresent the devoted victim, and which was pierced with a pointed\r\ninstrument, each stab being accompanied by a magic imprecation:\r\n\r\n  Devovet absentes, simulacraque cerea fingit.\r\n\r\nThese means the ancients called _carmina, incantationes, devotiones\r\nsortiariae_. It is somewhat strange that this same ceremony of the waxen\r\nimage to destroy the object of our hate was also employed to obtain love.\r\nThe figure was on these occasions called by the name of the person, and\r\nafterwards placed near the fire, when, as the heat gradually melted it,\r\nthe obdurate heart of the lover was simultaneously softened. At other\r\ntimes two images were thus exposed to heat, the one of clay, the other of\r\nwax; and, while the one melted, the other became more hardened:--a\r\nvindictive feeling, to render our own heart insensible, while we mollified\r\nthat of an ingrate; or perhaps with a view to render that heart inflexible\r\nto others, while it propitiated the addresses of the supplicant. Thus\r\nVirgil:\r\n\r\n  Limus ut hic durescit, et haec ut cera liquescit,\r\n  Uno eodemque igni; sic nostro Daphnis amore.\r\n  Sparge molam, et fragiles incende bitumine lauros.\r\n  Daphnis me malus urit, ego hanc in Daphnide laurum.\r\n\r\nThe wishes of the ancients for those they loved were sometimes curious,\r\nand they often turned round a mystic wheel, praying that the object of\r\ntheir affections might fall down at their door and roll himself in the\r\ndirt.\r\n\r\nThe ancients, who daily witnessed this influence of the imagination in\r\ncausing and in curing disease, have left us many valuable injunctions on\r\nthe subject; and Plato thus expresses himself: \"The office of the\r\nphysician extends equally to the purification of mind and body; to neglect\r\nthe one is to expose the other to evident peril. It is not only the body\r\nthat by its sound constitution strengthens the soul, but the\r\nwell-regulated soul, by its authoritative power, maintains the body in\r\nperfect health.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful to whom we owe the introduction of this article of luxury\r\ninto Europe. The plant is a native of that part of Arabia called _Yemen_,\r\nbut we find no mention made of it until the sixteenth century; and it is\r\nbelieved that Leonhart Rauwolf, a German physician, was the first writer\r\nwho spoke of it, in a work published in 1573. The plant was also described\r\nby Prosper Alpinus, in his treatise on Egyptian plants, published in 1591\r\nand 1592. Pietro della Valle wrote from Constantinople in 1615 that he\r\nwould teach Europe the manner in which the Turks made their _cahue_. This\r\nspelling was no doubt incorrect; for, in a pamphlet printed at Oxford in\r\n1659, in Arabic and English, it is written _kauhi_, or _coffee_. Purchas,\r\nwho was a contemporary of Della Valle, called it _coffa_; and Burton thus\r\nspeaks of its use: \"The Turks have a drink called _coffa_, so named of a\r\nberry as black as soot and as bitter, which they sip still of, and sup as\r\nwarm as they can suffer. They spend much time in their coffa-houses, which\r\nare somewhat like our alehouses and taverns, and there they sit chatting\r\nand drinking to drive away the time and to be merry together, because they\r\nfind by experience that kinde of drink so used helpeth digestion and\r\nprocureth alacrity.\"\r\n\r\nThe first coffee-house opened in London was in 1652. A Turkey merchant, of\r\nthe name of Edwards, having brought with him from the Levant some coffee\r\nand a Greek servant, he allowed him to prepare and sell this beverage;\r\nwhen he established a house in St. Michael's Alley, Cornhill, on the spot\r\nwhere the Virginia Coffee-house now stands. Garraway's was the first\r\ncoffee-house opened after the fire in 1666. It appears, however, that\r\ncoffee was used in France in 1640; and a sale of it was opened at\r\nMarseilles in 1671.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of this berry was furiously opposed; and it appears that\r\nin its native land it was treated with no less severity, since, in an\r\nArabian MS. in the King of France's library, coffee-houses were suppressed\r\nin the East. In 1663 appeared a pamphlet against it, entitled \"A Cup of\r\nCoffee, or Coffee in its Colours.\" In 1672 the following lines were to be\r\nfound in another publication, \"A Broadside against Coffee, or the Marriage\r\nof the Turk:\"\r\n\r\n  Confusion huddles all into one scene,\r\n  Like Noah's ark, the clean and the unclean.\r\n  For now, alas! the drench has credit got,\r\n  And he's no gentleman who drinks it not.\r\n\r\nThen came \"The Woman's Petition against Coffee,\" which appeared in 1674,\r\nin which we find the following complaint: \"It made men as unfruitful as\r\nthe deserts whence that unhappy berry is said to be brought, so much so,\r\nthat the offspring of our mighty ancestors would dwindle into a succession\r\nof apes and pigmies; and on a domestic message a husband would stop by the\r\nway to drink a couple of cups of coffee.\" It was then sold in convenient\r\npennyworths;--hence coffee-houses where wits, _quidnuncs_, and idlers\r\nresorted, were called \"penny universities.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it had adversaries, coffee was not left without eloquent advocates.\r\nSir Henry Blount, in his _Organon Salutis_, 1659, thus speaks of it: \"This\r\ncoffa-drink has caused a great sobriety among all nations. Formerly\r\napprentices, clerks, &c. used to take their morning-draughts in ale,\r\nbeer, or wine, which often made them unfit for business. Now they play the\r\ngood-fellows in this wakeful and civil drink. The worthy gentleman, Sir\r\nJames Muddiford, who introduced the practice hereof in London, deserves\r\nmuch respect of the whole nation.\"\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that the jealousy with which the use of coffee was\r\nviewed, even by the government, arose more from the nature of the\r\nconversations that took place in coffee-houses during moments of public\r\nexcitement, than from the apprehension of any injury that its consumption\r\nmight have caused to the public health. In the reign of Charles II.\r\ncoffee-houses were shut up by a proclamation, issued in 1675, as the\r\nretailing of coffee \"nourished sedition, spread lies, _scandalized great\r\nmen_, and might therefore be considered a _common nuisance_.\" As a\r\n_nuisance_, its abolition was considered as not being an infringement of\r\nthe constitution! Notwithstanding this Machiavellian torturing of the\r\nletter to serve the spirit, this arbitrary act occasioned loud and violent\r\ndiscontent; and permission was given to reopen coffee-houses, on condition\r\nthat the landlords should not allow any scandalous papers containing\r\nscandalous reports against the government or _great men_ to be read on\r\ntheir premises!\r\n\r\nThe use, or rather the abuse, of coffee is said to produce feverish heat,\r\nanxiety, palpitations, trembling, weakness of sight, and predisposition to\r\napoplexy. Its effects in checking somnolence have been long known.\r\nHowever, the action of this berry differs according to its being roasted\r\nor raw. An infusion of torrefied coffee assists digestion, and frequently\r\nremoves headaches resulting from derangement in the digestive functions.\r\nIt also neutralizes the effect of narcotics, especially opium, and this\r\npower is increased by the addition of lemon juice. A similar mixture has\r\nbeen known to cure obstinate agues. Musgrave and Percival recommended its\r\nuse in asthma: indeed, most persons who labour under this distressing\r\nmalady seem to derive relief from its use.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration all that has been advanced in regard to the\r\ninconveniences that may attend the use of coffee and tea, they must be\r\nconsidered as overruled by the moral results that have arisen from the\r\nintroduction of these beverages; and a late writer has observed, that it\r\nhas \"led to the most wonderful change that ever took place in the diet of\r\ncivilized nations,--a change highly important both in a moral and physical\r\npoint of view. These beverages have the admirable advantage of affording\r\nstimulus without producing intoxication.\" Raynal observes, that the use of\r\ntea has contributed more to the sobriety of the Chinese than the severest\r\nlaws, the most eloquent discourses, or the best treatises on morality.\r\n\r\nThe quality and effects of coffee differ according to the manner in which\r\nit is roasted. Bernier states that when he was at Cairo there were only\r\ntwo persons in that great city who knew how to prepare it to perfection.\r\nIf it be underdone, its virtues will not be imparted, and its infusion\r\nwill load and oppress the stomach; if it be overdone, its properties will\r\nbe destroyed, and it will heat the body, and act as an astringent.\r\n\r\nThe best coffee is the _Mocha_, or that which is commonly called Turkey\r\ncoffee. It should be chosen of a greenish, light, olive hue; the berries\r\nof a middling size, clean, and plump.\r\n\r\nThe bad effects of coffee may in all likelihood be attributed both to its\r\npowerful and stimulating aroma and to its pungent acidity. According to\r\nCadet, this acid is the _gallic_; while Grindel considers it the _kinic_,\r\nand Pfaff terms it the _caffeic_ acid. When strongly heated, it yields a\r\n_pyro-caffeic_ acid, from which may be obtained a most pungent vinegar,\r\nthat has recently been thrown into trade, but, I believe, with little or\r\nno success.\r\n\r\nThe principle of coffee is the _caffein_, discovered by Robiquet, in 1821;\r\nand it is to this active principle that its beneficial or baneful effects\r\ncan be attributed. Recent experiments tend to show that it is possessed of\r\npowerful febrifuge virtues. To obtain this result, raw coffee has been\r\nused. It gives to water a greenish hue, and, thus saturated, it has been\r\ncalled the _citrine coffee_. Grindel has used this preparation in the\r\ntreatment of intermittent fevers in the Russian hospital of Dorpat; he\r\nalso administered the raw coffee in powder. In eighty cases of this fever\r\nscarcely any resisted the power of this medicine, given either in\r\ndecoction, powder, or extract; but he seems to consider the latter form\r\nthe most effectual. From this physician's observations, coffee may become\r\na valuable addition to our _materia medica_; and the homoeopathic\r\npractitioners maintain that they have employed it with great success in\r\nvarious maladies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAQUA TOPHANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was for a long time supposed that there actually did exist in Italy a\r\nsecret poison, the effects of which were slow, and even unheeded, until a\r\nlingering malady had consumed the sufferer. No suspicions were excited;\r\nor, had they led to any _post mortem_ examination, no trace of the\r\nterrific preparation's effects could have been detected.\r\n\r\nIt was towards the year 1659, during the pontificate of Alexander VII.,\r\nthat the existence of this baneful preparation was suspected. Many young\r\nwomen had been left widows; and many younger husbands, who might have\r\nceased to please their wives, had died away. A certain society of young\r\nladies had been observed to meet under the auspices of an elderly matron\r\nof rather a questionable character, who had been known in her horoscopic\r\npredictions to announce deaths that had but too truly taken place about\r\nthe period she prophesied. One of the society, it appears, _peached_\r\nagainst her companions, who were all apprehended and put to the torture;\r\nand the lady patroness, whose name was Spara, was executed with four of\r\nher pupils. This Spara was a Sicilian, who had obtained the fatal secret\r\nfrom Tofania at Naples. Hence the composition was named _aqua Tofania_,\r\n_aqua della Toffana_, and _acquetta di Napoli_. These deadly drops had\r\nbeen charitably distributed by Tofania to various uncomfortable ladies who\r\nwished to get rid of their lords, and were contained in small phials,\r\nbearing the inscription of \"_Manna de San Nicolas de Bari_.\" This hag had\r\nlived to an old age, but was at length dragged from a monastery, in which\r\nshe had sought a sanctuary, tortured, and duly strangled, after a\r\nconfession of her crimes.\r\n\r\nGarelli, physician to Charles VI., thus wrote to Hoffmann on the subject:\r\n\"Your elegant dissertation on the popular errors respecting poisons\r\nbrought to my recollection a certain slow poison which that infamous\r\npoisoner, still alive in prison at Naples, employed to the destruction of\r\nupwards of six hundred persons. It was nothing else than crystallized\r\narsenic dissolved in a large quantity of water by decoction, with the\r\naddition, but for what purpose I know not, of the herb _cymbalaria_\r\n(_antirrhinum_). This was communicated to me by his Imperial Majesty\r\nhimself, and confirmed by the confession of the criminal in the judicial\r\nprocedure.\"\r\n\r\nAbbe Gagliani, however, gives a different account of the secret Neapolitan\r\ndrug. \"At Naples,\" he says, \"the mixture of opium and cantharides is known\r\nto be a slow poison; the surest of all, and the most infallible, as one\r\ncannot mistrust it. At first, it is given in small doses, that its effects\r\nmay be insensible. In Italy it is called _aqua di Tufinia_: no one can\r\navoid its attacks, since the liquid is as limpid as water, and cannot be\r\nsuspected. Most of the ladies of Naples have some of it lying carelessly\r\non their toilet-tables with smelling-bottles; but they always can know the\r\nfatal phial when they need its contents.\" A curious observer has remarked\r\non these two preparations, that the mixture of Garelli was, perhaps,\r\nintended for husbands, while that of Gagliani was for the use of lovers.\r\n\r\nThis remark appears judicious, since the potion described by the Abbe was\r\nevidently intended as an amorous philter. Under that head I have related\r\nmany curious circumstances. There is no doubt but that these preparations\r\noften contained deadly drugs, the perilous qualities of which were most\r\nprobably unknown to those who made them up without any sinister motives.\r\nPlutarch and Cornelius Nepos inform us that Lucullus, the Roman General,\r\nlost his reason, and subsequently his life, from having taken one of these\r\nmixtures; and Caius Caligula was driven into a fit of insanity by a\r\nphilter given to him by his wife Caesonia, as described by Lucretius:\r\n\r\n  Tamen hoc tolerabile, si non\r\n  Et furere incipias, ut avunculus ille Neronis\r\n  Cui totam tremuli frontem Caesonia pulli\r\n  Infudit.\r\n\r\nVirgil also alludes to the powerful and baneful nature of the plants\r\nemployed in magical incantations:\r\n\r\n  Has herbas, atque haec Ponto mihi lecta venena\r\n  Ipse dedit Moeris; nascuntur plurima Ponto.\r\n  His ego saepe lupum fieri, et se condere silvis\r\n  Moerin, saepe animas imis excire sepulchris,\r\n  Atque satas alio vidi traducere messes.\r\n\r\nFemale poisoners of a somewhat similar description were known amongst the\r\nancients. Nero, when he resolved to destroy Britannicus, sent for one of\r\nthose murderers, named Locusta, who, convicted of several assassinations,\r\nwas pardoned, but kept by the emperor to execute his secret purposes. He\r\nwished that on this occasion the poison should produce immediate death.\r\nLocusta prepared a drug that destroyed a goat in a few minutes. This was\r\nnot sufficiently active. The next preparation killed a hog in a few\r\nseconds. It was approved of. The ill-fated youth was seated at the\r\nimperial festive board--the potion poured into his goblet--and he died in\r\nepileptic convulsions. Nero, undisturbed, requested his guests to remain\r\nquiet--the youth he said was subject to similar attacks, which in general\r\nwere but of short duration; but soon the black, the livid hue of the face\r\nbetrayed the poison, which the imperial assassin sought to conceal, by\r\nordering this tell-tale sign to be concealed with paint. Sir Henry Halford\r\nseems to think that Juvenal alludes to this circumstance in his first\r\nSatire.\r\n\r\n  Instituit rudes melior Locusta propinquas\r\n  Per famam et populum _nigros_ effere maritos.\r\n\r\nThe poisons used by the ancients appear to have been of various kinds;\r\nsome more slow in their action than others, to suit, most probably, the\r\nviews of their employers. Socrates, it is supposed, drank the _cicuta_,\r\nthe action of which must have been very slow and weak, since his gaoler\r\ninformed him that if he could exert himself in a warm debate, the effects\r\nmight be arrested. The philosopher, however, remained tranquil. He shortly\r\nafter experienced a numbness in the legs, gradually became insensible, and\r\nexpired in convulsions.\r\n\r\nThese secret poisons were conveyed in the most stealthy manner. Hence it\r\nis related, that the poison prepared by Antipater, to destroy Alexander,\r\nhad been conveyed in a mule's hoof, being of so corroding a nature, that\r\nno metallic vessel could contain it. This absurd story was credited by\r\nPlutarch and Quintus Curtius, whereas it appears more probable that poison\r\nwas carried in an _onyx_, of which trinkets to contain precious ointments\r\nwere frequently made, or under a human nail, also called _Unguis_, or\r\n[Greek: onux]. The latter case was the opinion of Dr. Heberden.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Halford, in his learned and interesting essay on the deaths of\r\nillustrious persons of antiquity, has clearly proved that Alexander was\r\nnot poisoned, but died of a lingering fever of a remittent type; a disease\r\nthat was most probably endemic in the marshes surrounding the city of\r\nBabylon.\r\n\r\nMany absurd ideas regarding venenose substances prevailed in ancient days\r\nas well as in modern times. Hannibal and Themistocles were said to have\r\nbeen poisoned with bullocks' blood.\r\n\r\nEastern nations fancy that a fascinating power is the gift of virtue. In\r\nthe _Hitapadesa_ of _Vishnusannan_ we find the following aphorism: \"As a\r\ncharmer draweth a serpent from his hole, so a good wife, taking her\r\nhusband from a place of torture, enjoyeth happiness with him.\" Possibly\r\nsome receipt of this description may be found in the archives of Doctors'\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLICA POLONICA AND HUMAN HAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nHair may be considered a vegetation from the surface of the body. In a\r\nstate of health, hairs are insensible, and it is more than probable that\r\nthey possess no nerves, and that the circulation is carried on in the same\r\nmanner as in plants. In the bulb or root of the hair, however, the vessels\r\nthat promote this circulation are numerous, and there we may trace the\r\ndiseases that affect this beauteous ornament of mankind, more especially\r\nin the Caucasian race. Long hair, of course, requires more nutriment than\r\nscanty locks, and some physicians have been of opinion that their great\r\nlength debilitates. Dr. Parr affirms that he has observed symptoms of\r\nplethoric congestion to arise after long hair had been suddenly cut off.\r\n\r\nVauquelin has made curious experiments on this substance. A solution of\r\nblack hair has deposited a black matter containing bitumen, sulphur, and\r\niron; and alcohol extracted from the same coloured hair a whitish and a\r\ngrayish-green oil. Red hair yielded whitish matter and a blood-red oil.\r\nWhite hair contained phosphate of magnesia, affording a proof of the\r\ndisposition towards the formation of calcareous matter in old age. When\r\nhair becomes suddenly white under the shock of a severe moral impression,\r\nVauquelin is of opinion that this phenomenon is to be attributed to the\r\nsudden extrication of some acid, as the oxymuriatic acid is found to\r\nwhiten black hair. Parr thinks that this accident may be owing to an\r\nabsorption of the oil of the hair by its sulphur, as in the operation of\r\nwhitening woollen cloths.\r\n\r\nThe _plica_ is a curious and disgusting malady, that has been considered a\r\ndisease of the hair, which, according to vulgar report, secreted and shed\r\nblood. This affection is common and endemic in Poland; hence the term\r\n_Polonica_ that has been given to it. The invasion of this pestilence has\r\nbeen traced to the irruption of the Moguls, from 1241 to 1287, chiefly\r\nunder the command of Cayuk, grandson of Yenghiz. The most absurd tales\r\nwere then related of the manner in which this dreaded infection was\r\npropagated. Spondanus affirms that it arose from the waters having been\r\npoisoned by venomous plants. Pistorius and Pauli relate that these waters\r\nwere corrupted by the great number of human hearts that the Moguls cast in\r\nrivers and in wells. This supposition arose from the unheard-of acts of\r\nbarbarity perpetrated by the ferocious invaders on the wretched population\r\nof Prussia, Poland, Hungary, and Transylvania. Their refined cruelty has\r\nbeen depicted by Gebhardi, in his history of Hungary, in the most glowing\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nOther historians assert that the plica originated in the East; such is the\r\nopinion of Stabel, Spreugel, and other writers. Rodrigo de Fonseca relates\r\nthat the Indians, after drinking certain waters, were attacked with a\r\ndisease in which the hair became agglomerated and matted in the most\r\ndisgusting manner. Erndtel attributes the malady in Poland to the\r\ngluttonous consumption of horseflesh. However this may be, Poland has been\r\never considered the country most exposed to this visitation.\r\n\r\nThis disease affords a convincing proof of the vascularity of the hair,\r\nsince it tumefies, augments in capacity so as to allow an evident\r\ncirculation of blood, as the hairs will often bleed when divided with the\r\nscissors. Dr. Kerckhoffs regards the malady as the mere result of the\r\ncustom among the filthy Poles of letting the hair grow to an immense\r\nlength, of never combing or cleaning it, and always keeping the head\r\ncovered with a woollen or leathern cap. Hence he observes that the rich\r\nare generally exempt from the affection which particularly prevails\r\namongst the Jews. With this view of the disorder, he thinks that\r\ncleanliness and the excision of the matted hair are sufficient to effect a\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, more than probable that other causes occasion this\r\nhorrible disease; and there is but little doubt that the system is\r\naffected by a particular virus. In many instances affections of the head\r\ncomplicate it; although it is likely that they may result from the\r\nconstant irritation of the scalp, that sympathizes so powerfully with the\r\nmembranes of the brain.\r\n\r\nThe different names given to the _plica_ indicate more or less the ideas\r\nthat prevail regarding its nature. The Poles call it _gwozdiec_ or\r\n_gwodziec_, which signifies a _nail_ that splits the wood into which it is\r\ndriven. In the district of the Roxolans it is termed _koltun_, _a stake_.\r\nIn Germany superstitious fancies have also given it various curious\r\ndenominations. It is called _alpzopf_ and _schraitelzopf_, as being the\r\nresult of the _malefices_ of vampires and incubi. By some it is asserted\r\nthat the Moravians, natural enemies of the Poles, not having been able to\r\nconquer them by their arms, had recourse to magical art to inflict this\r\nscourge: hence they term it _mahrenflechten_, _mahrenwichtung_. To this\r\nday it is called _hexenzopf_ and _bichteln_, or unbaptized, alluding, no\r\ndoubt, to the Jews, who were accused of having introduced the disorder in\r\nthe deadly hate they bore the Christians; hence was it also known by the\r\nname of _Judenzopf_ (_Coma Judaeorum_).\r\n\r\nAmongst the whimsical ideas to which the _plica_ has given rise, the most\r\nextraordinary effort of the imagination was that of Hercules Saxoniae. He\r\nmaintained that the fabulous description of the heads of the Gorgons and\r\nthe Furies was derived from this affection: \"_Caput Gorgoneum, caput\r\nFuriarum, vera humana capita fuisse, et fictitiis poetarum occasionem\r\npraebuisse_.\"\r\n\r\nThere are instances on record of infants being born with this loathsome\r\nmalady. Davidson attributes this circumstance to the mental impressions of\r\nthe mother: \"_Si ita matris ac nutricis superstitioni placere libuerit_.\"\r\nThe length of the matted hair in plica is frequently considerable:\r\nBachstrom relates the case of a Prussian woman whose hair extended beyond\r\nthe sides of her bed, and she was in the habit of turning it over to make\r\na quilt of it; Caligerus saw a man in Copenhagen whose clotted locks were\r\nsix feet three inches in length; and Rzaczyinski gives an account of a\r\nwoman whose hair measured six ells. In the museum of Dr. Meckel, at Halle,\r\nis to be seen a specimen of the disease eight feet long. The beard and the\r\nhair of other parts of the body are equally liable to these attacks; while\r\nthe affection has been observed in horses, dogs, and other animals. A\r\ncurious case is related on this subject by Dr. Schlegel: A drunken\r\ncoachman was carried away by a pair of spirited young horses, who\r\nprecipitated themselves, with the fragments of the broken carriage, into\r\nthe Moskwa. One of the animals was drowned; but the other contrived to\r\nextricate itself, and swam ashore. It continued sick for a considerable\r\ntime, and, on its convalescence the plica broke out in its entire coat.\r\n\r\nThe assertion that the hairs become endowed with sensibility in this\r\ndisorder is unfounded. The pain is experienced in the root or bulb; thus a\r\npainful sensation is occasionally felt when a lock of hair has been turned\r\nback under the nightcap. There is little doubt that the plica is to be\r\nattributed to a specific virus, which pervades the whole system unless\r\nsuccessfully treated. The most serious accidents have arisen from\r\nneglecting it; and Starnigelio gives the following horrible account of its\r\nravages. \"Magno omnium malo magnoque cruciatu divagatur: infringit ossa,\r\nlaxat artus, vertebras eorum infestat. Membra conglobat et retorquet;\r\ngibbos efficit, pediculos fundit, caputque aliis atque aliis succedentibus\r\nita opplet, ut nequaquam purgari possit. Si cirri raduntur, humor ille et\r\nvirus in corpus relabitur, et affectos, ut supra scriptum est, torquet;\r\ncaput, manus, pedes, omnes artus, omnes juncturas, omnes corporis partes\r\nexagitat.\"\r\n\r\nAmongst the various specifics recommended for the cure of plica, is the\r\n_lycopodium_, hence called _herba plicaria_; the _vinca_, or _perventia_.\r\nThe [Greek: daphnoeides] and [Greek: kamai daphne] of the Greeks was also\r\nextolled, possibly from its supposed powers in cases of incantation,\r\nwhence Apuleius calls it \"_victoria, quod vinceret pervinceretque injuriam\r\ntemporis_.\" This is the plant for which Rousseau felt such a predilection,\r\nthat in after life he never beheld it without experiencing a delightful\r\nrecollection of the pleasures of his boyhood. Its flowers are considered\r\nthe symbol of virginity, and in Flanders are still called _Maegden-palm_.\r\nIn Etruria maidens are crowned with a wreath of it on their funerals.\r\n\r\nThe decay and fall of the hair is an accident of frequent occurrence. This\r\nunpleasant drawback on vanity has been termed _alopecia_, from the Greek\r\nword [Greek: alopex], _vulpes_, a _fox_; this animal and the wolf being\r\nsaid to lose their hair and become bald sooner than any other quadruped.\r\nThe Arabian writers were impressed with the same belief, and named the\r\naffection _daustaleb_, literally the _wolf disease_. Baldness is more\r\nfrequent in males than in females; and it has been observed, that\r\nemasculated subjects are exempt from its visitation.\r\n\r\nAmongst the singular anomalies that characterize our ideas, the respect in\r\nwhich hair (naturally unclean unless most carefully attended to) was held\r\nat various periods is as singular as the fond devotion with which it is\r\ntreasured when having belonged to the objects of our affections. In\r\nancient Rome neglected hair was the badge of bondage, and slaves were\r\ndistinguished by the _capillum passum, fluxum, et intonsum_. Free men, on\r\nthe contrary, took great care of it; and the term _caesaries_ is said to be\r\nderived from the frequency of its cutting, while _coma_ alluded to the\r\ngreat attention paid to its ornamental appearance. The Gauls wore long\r\nhair, and their country was thence called _Gallia Comata_. The German\r\nchiefs, deprived of their rank and power, were shorn of their locks as a\r\nmark of degradation and loss of strength. Shaving the heads of criminals\r\nis to this day considered ignominious.\r\n\r\nHair, most unquestionably, constitutes the proudest ornament of female\r\nbeauty; and clustering locks, compared both by the ancients and the\r\nOriental poets to the growth of grapes, has ever been considered a\r\n_desideratum_ at the female toilet, artificial means to curl it having\r\nbeen resorted to from time immemorial, even by men. We find Virgil\r\nspeaking contemptuously of Aeneas for the care he took of his locks:\r\n\r\n  Vibratos calido ferro, myrrhaque madentes.\r\n\r\nThe Romans called a man who thus frizzled himself, _homo calamistratus_.\r\n\r\nCrisp and curled ringlets were ever admired, and Petrarch thus describes\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n  Aura che quelle chiome bionde e _crespe_\r\n  Circondi, e movi, e se mossa de loro\r\n  Soave mente, e spargi quel dolce oro\r\n  E poi'l raccogli, e'n bei nodi _l'increspe_.\r\n\r\nApuleius maintains, that if Venus were bald, though circled by the graces\r\nand the loves, she would not please even swarthy Vulcan. Petronius, in his\r\ndescription of Circe, describes her tresses naturally curling, and falling\r\nnegligently over her shoulders, which they entirely covered. Apuleius\r\npraises her trailing locks, thick and long, and insensibly curling,\r\ndispersed over her divine neck, softly undulating with carelessness. Ovid\r\nnotices those beauties who platted their braided hair like spiral shells.\r\nPetronius, to give an idea of a perfect beauty, says, that her forehead\r\nwas small, and showed the roots of her hair raised upwards. This fashion,\r\nadopted by the Chinese, was not long ago a modish _coeffure_ in France.\r\nLucian, however, makes Thais say of a rival courtezan, \"Who can praise\r\nher person, unless he is blind? Does she not draw up her scanty hair on\r\nher large forehead?\"\r\n\r\nThe ancients also perfumed their hair, especially on festivals, with\r\nvarious ointments, composed of the spikenard and different balsams. They\r\nalso occasionally painted it with a bright yellow. Unhappy must have been\r\nthe poor slaves who had to attend a Roman lady's toilet; if a single\r\nringlet was displaced, the scourge was applied, and the _cow-skin_ of our\r\nWest Indian planters, the _Taurea_ (\"_scutica de pene taurino_\") brought\r\ninto play; and not unfrequently the head of the offender was broken with\r\nthe steel mirror that betrayed their negligence to the impatient fair one.\r\nAs we are on the subject of female ingenuity in endeavouring to spread\r\ntheir nets more cunningly, it may be some comfort to our modern coquettes\r\nto know that antiquity seems to sanction the use of rouge, notwithstanding\r\nthe fate of Jezabel. Plautus tells us that the Roman dames daubed their\r\nfaces with the \"_fucus_, compound of white lead and of vermilion:\" hence\r\nwere they called _fucatae_, _cerusatae_, and _minionatae_. Various cosmetics\r\nwere also employed, and, when at home, their faces were preserved with a\r\ncoat of paste, the skin having been previously rubbed with a pumice-stone,\r\nand then washed with asses' milk. Poppaea, the wife of Nero, had five\r\nhundred asses milked every day for her baths; and when she was exiled, a\r\nreduction of her establishment to fifty asses was considered a severe\r\nchastisement. Patches were also worn, of various shapes and dimensions,\r\neven by men; and Pliny tells us of one Regulus, a lawyer, who put a patch\r\nupon his right or left eye as he was going to plead for plaintiff or\r\ndefendant.\r\n\r\nThe ancients also wore a certain hair-powder, a custom that was only\r\nrevived in Europe in the seventeenth century, since it appears that this\r\nfilthy fashion was brought in vogue at the fair of St. Germain, in 1614,\r\nby some beautiful ballad-singers.\r\n\r\nIn ancient mythology, hair was the symbol of life. All dead persons were\r\nsupposed to be under the jurisdiction of the infernal deities, and no man\r\ncould resign his life until some of his hair was cut off. Euripides\r\nintroduces Death going to cut off some of the hair of Alcestis, when\r\ndoomed to die instead of her husband Admetus; and Virgil describes Dido\r\nunable to resign her life, from her hair having been cut off by\r\nProserpine, until Iris was sent by Juno to perform the kind office:\r\n\r\n          \"Hunc ego Diti\r\n  Sacrum jussa fero, teque isto corpore solvo.\"\r\n  Sic ait, et dextra crinem secat; omnis et una\r\n  Dilapsus, calor, atque in ventos vita recessit.\r\n\r\nLocks of hair were suspended over the door of the deceased, to show that\r\nthe family were in mourning. On these occasions, the hair was torn, cut\r\noff, or shaved. It was then sometimes strewed over the dead body, or cast\r\non the funeral pile. On the demise of great men, whole cities and\r\ncommunities were shorn, while animals shared a similar fate. Admetus, on\r\nthe death of Alcestis, ordered this operation to be performed on his\r\nchariot horses: and when Masistius was slain by the Athenians, the\r\nPersians shaved themselves, their horses, and their mules. Alexander, not\r\nsatisfied with this testimony of grief, ordered the very battlements of a\r\ncity to be knocked down, that the town might look bald and shorn of its\r\nbeauty.\r\n\r\nWhile in some cases bald heads were expressive of affliction, in others\r\nlong hair denoted grief; Joseph allowed his hair to grow during his\r\ncaptivity; and Mephibosheth did the same when David was banished from\r\nJerusalem. Juvenal informs us that mariners, on their escape from\r\nshipwreck, shaved their heads; and Lycophron describes long and neglected\r\nhair as a sign of general lamentation.\r\n\r\nTo be shaved by barbers was a proof of cheerfulness; but to cut off one's\r\nown hair denoted mourning. Hence Artemidorus informs us that for a man to\r\ndream of shaving himself was a presage of some calamity. However, this\r\nceremony may, in its signification, be attributed to the customs of the\r\nvarious nations. Where the hair was generally worn short, its length\r\nindicated grief, and _vice versa_. The filth of long and neglected hair\r\nmight also have been considered a proper and respectful mark of\r\ntribulation; for the ancients fancied that rolling themselves in the dirt\r\nwas a convincing proof of affection; and we see Oeneus besmearing\r\nhimself with nastiness on the death of his son Meleager:\r\n\r\n  Pulvere canitiem genitor, vultusque seniles\r\n  Foedat humi fusos, spatiosumque increpat aevum.\r\n\r\nShaving was also a nuptial ceremony, when virgins presented their hair to\r\nVenus, Juno, Minerva, Diana, and other propitious divinities. At\r\nTroezene virgins were obliged to sacrifice their hair to Hippolytus, the\r\nson of Theseus, who died for his chastity. The Megarensian maidens\r\npresented them to Sphinoe, daughter of Alcathous, who died a virgin.\r\nStatius records this ceremony, when speaking of Minerva's temple:\r\n\r\n            Hic more parentum\r\n  Insides, thalamis ubi casta adolescerat aetas,\r\n  Virgineas libare comas; primosque solebant\r\n  Excusare toros.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANIMAL MAGNETISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAre we to give credit to the various observations that record the\r\nwonderful effects of animal magnetism; or should we reject them as the\r\nimpostures of knaves, or the result of the credulity of fools? It is now\r\nnearly half a century since this method of relieving diseases has been\r\nintroduced by modern practitioners. Thousands of disinterested and candid\r\nwitnesses have corroborated their assertions, and testified to their\r\nveracity. How, then, are we authorized to treat this doctrine as visionary\r\nor fraudulent? The most learned bodies have not thought it derogatory to\r\ntheir dignity to investigate the matter; and, notwithstanding opposition,\r\nridicule, and contempt, the practice obtains to the present day. It has,\r\nno doubt, been materially impeded in its progress by the invectives of\r\noccasional scepticism; but such will ever be the case with science, and\r\nthose discoveries which accelerate its inevitable empire on the human\r\nunderstanding. Persecution may be considered as the harbinger of truth,\r\nor, at any rate, of that investigation which directs to it. Pythagoras was\r\nbanished from Athens; Anaxagoras was immured in a dungeon; Democritus was\r\nconsidered a maniac, and Socrates condemned to death. An advanced and\r\nhonourable old age did not protect Galileo against his barbarous\r\npersecutors. Varolius was decreed an infamous and execrable man for his\r\nanatomical discoveries, and our immortal Harvey was looked upon as a\r\ndangerous madman. Inoculation and vaccination were deemed impious attempts\r\nto interfere with the decrees of Providence.\r\n\r\nMagnetism may be defined as a reciprocal influence which is supposed to\r\nexist between individuals, arising from a state of relative harmony, and\r\nbrought into action by the will, the imagination, or physical sensibility.\r\nThis influence is said to exist in a peculiar fluid, transmissible from\r\none body to another under certain conditions of each individual, without\r\nwhich the expected results are not manifest. Under these conditions, the\r\neffects of animal magnetism are obtained by manual application, by\r\ngestures, words, and even looks, more frequently, as may be easily\r\nconceived, with nervous, weak, and impressionable individuals. By these\r\nmeans magnetizers affirm that they can effect cures when all other\r\nremedial endeavours have been of no avail, either when the patient is\r\nawake or in a state of artificial somnambulism.\r\n\r\nThe history of this doctrine is curious. The ancients fully admitted the\r\npower of sympathy in the cure of diseases; but generally attributed its\r\naction to the interference of Divinity, or the operation of sorcery and\r\nenchantment. A remarkable affinity can be traced between modern magnetism\r\nand its supposed phenomena, and the relations of the Pythian and Sibylline\r\noracles, the wonders of the caverns of Trophonius and Esculapius, and the\r\nmiraculous dreams and visions in the temples of the gods. Amongst the\r\nHebrews, the Egyptians, the Greeks, and Romans, we constantly discover\r\ntraces of this supposed power of manual apposition, friction, breathing,\r\nand the use of the charms of music and mystic amulets. The Egyptian\r\npriesthood were considered as possessing a divine attribute in healing\r\ndiseases. Prosper Alpinus, in his treatise on the medicine of the\r\nEgyptians, informs us that mysterious frictions were one of their secret\r\nremedies. The patients were oftentimes wrapped in the skins of animals,\r\nand carried into the sanctuary of their temples to be assisted by visions,\r\nthat appeared either to them or to their physicians, who pretended that\r\nIsis was the immortal source of these celestial inspirations. The same\r\ndivine assistance was firmly believed by the Hebrews. It was intimated to\r\nMiriam and Aaron that the Lord would make himself known to them in a\r\nvision, and speak to them in a dream; and we find in Deuteronomy that the\r\nsigns and the wonders of prophets and dreamers of dreams were to be\r\nconsidered as the abominations of idolaters, who were to be put to death\r\nwithout pity. This anathema on false prophets was not unfrequently\r\nrigorously carried into execution, and we read in the Book of Kings the\r\ndestruction of all the worshippers of Baal. Ahab marched upon\r\nRamoth-Gilead by the advice of his prophets.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic power of corporeal apposition was illustrated when Elisha,\r\nto revive the widow's child, stretched himself three times upon him and\r\nprayed to the Lord. When Elisha restored the child of the Shunamite to\r\nlife he lay upon it, put his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes,\r\nand his hands upon his hands, and he stretched himself upon the child, and\r\nthe child opened its eyes. Miracles were generally wrought by manual\r\napplication or elevation. Naaman expected that Elisha would have stricken\r\nhis hand over the place to cure his leprosy; and we find in the Scriptures\r\nthat our SAVIOUR healed the sick upon whom he laid his hands. Amongst the\r\nGreeks we again see the same ceremonies performed on all wonderful\r\nrecoveries. Plutarch tells us that Pyrrhus cured persons with diseased\r\nspleens by passing his hand over the seat of the malady. Aelianus informs\r\nus that the Psylli performed their cures by stretching themselves upon the\r\npatients, and making them swallow water with which they had rinsed their\r\nmouths; and he also mentions that those who approached these mysterious\r\nagents were seized with a sudden stupor, and deprived of their intellects\r\nuntil they had left them. Apollonius brought a young girl to life by\r\ntouching her, and leaning over her as though he were whispering some magic\r\nwords in her ear; and Origenes affirms that there were sages who dispensed\r\nhealth with their mere breath. Vespasian restored sight to the blind by\r\nrubbing their eyes and cheeks with his saliva, and cured a paralytic by\r\nmerely touching him: the same emperor kept himself in perfect health by\r\nfrequently rubbing his throat and his body. From a passage of Plautus, it\r\nappears that this manual application was resorted to in his days to\r\nprocure sleep. Mercury is made to say, \"Quid si ego illum tractem, tangam\r\nut dormiat;\" to which Sosia replies, \"Servaveris, nam continuas has tres\r\nnoctes pervigilavi.\"\r\n\r\nPliny maintains that there exist persons whose bodies are endowed with\r\nmedicinal properties; but he admits, at the same time, that imagination\r\nmay produce these salutary emanations. Celsus informs us that Asclepiades\r\nby friction could calm a phrensy; and further states, that when these\r\nfrictions were carried to too great an extent, they brought on a lethargic\r\nstate. Caelius Aurelianus recommends manual frictions for the cure of\r\npleurisy, lethargy, and various other maladies, describing the manner in\r\nwhich they are to be conducted: for instance, in epilepsy, the head and\r\nforehead are to be chafed, then the hand is to be carried gently over the\r\nneck and bosom; at other times, the extremities of the hands and feet are\r\nto be grasped, that \"we may cure by the very act of holding the limb.\"\r\n\r\nThat remedies were indicated in a state of somnambulism is affirmed by\r\nTertullian, who thus speaks of one of the followers of Prisca and\r\nMaximilla, two women who foretold future events when they fell into an\r\necstatic swoon: \"She conversed with angels, discovered the most hidden\r\nmysteries, prophesied, read the secrets of the heart, and pointed out\r\nremedies when she was consulted by the sick.\" He thus describes ecstasy in\r\nhis treatise _De Anima_: \"It is not sleep, for during sleep all reposes;\r\nwhereas in ecstasy the body reposes, while the soul is actively employed.\r\nIt is therefore a mixed state of sleep and ecstasy which constitutes the\r\nprophetic faculty, and it is then that we have revealed unto us, not only\r\nall that appertaineth to honour, to riches, but the means of curing our\r\ndiseases.\" St. Stephen relates the case of a youth who was in such a\r\nlethargic state, that he was insensible to all painful agents, and could\r\nnot be awakened; but when he recovered his senses, he declared that two\r\npersons, the one aged, the other young, had appeared to him and\r\nrecommended sea-bathing. He complied with the instruction, and was cured.\r\nBut the miracles of paganism were soon discredited, when the relics and\r\ntombs of saints were resorted to instead of the temples of the false gods;\r\nand priests assumed the power once held by their Chaldean and Egyptian\r\npredecessors, and the Druids of Gaul. The beatified were not only\r\nphysicians during their life, but medicinal after death. St. Gregory of\r\nTours tells us that St. Cosmus and St. Damian were not only able\r\nphysicians during their blessed existence, but assisted all those who\r\nconsulted them in their tombs, not unfrequently appearing to them in\r\nvisions, and prescribing the proper remedies. A saint's breathing upon a\r\nveil, and then placing it on the head of a demoniac, infallibly cast out\r\nthe evil one; and St. Bernard never failed in his exorcisms, by making the\r\npossessed swallow some water in which he had dipped his hands. St. Martin\r\nstopped the most fearful hemorrhage by merely touching the patient with\r\nhis garment. The shrines of St. Litardus, St. Anthony, and various other\r\nsaints, lulled to sleep, and inspired with miraculous visions those who\r\nsought their aid.\r\n\r\nHowever, as the progress of intellect dispelled the dark clouds that\r\nshrouded the middle ages in superstitious and credulous prejudices,\r\nphilosophy endeavoured to investigate the nature of this mysterious\r\nagency, which priests had for so many centuries usurped as their special\r\ngift and property. Sceptic as to supernatural powers in the common\r\noccurrences of life, philosophers attributed these phenomena to some\r\npeculiar principle with which organized bodies were endowed, and hence\r\narose the dawn of the doctrine of animal magnetism. So early as 1462,\r\nPomponatius of Mantua maintained, in his work on incantation, that all the\r\npretended arts of sorcery and witchcraft were the mere results of natural\r\noperations; he further gave it as his opinion, that it was not improbable\r\nbut that external means, called into action by the soul, might relieve our\r\nsufferings; that there, moreover, did exist individuals endowed with\r\nsalutary properties, and it might therefore easily be conceived that\r\nmarvellous effects should be produced by the imagination, and by\r\nconfidence, more especially when they are reciprocal between the patient\r\nand the person who assists his recovery; physicians and men of sense being\r\nwell convinced that if the bones of any animal were substituted for those\r\nof a saint, the result would be the same. It need not be added that our\r\nauthor was violently persecuted for this heretical doctrine. Two years\r\nafter, Agrippa, in Cologne, asserted that the soul, inflamed by a fervent\r\nimagination, could dispense health and disease, not only in the individual\r\nhimself, but in other bodies. In 1493, Paracelsus expressed himself in the\r\nfollowing language: \"All doubt destroys work, and leaves it imperfect in\r\nthe wise designs of nature. It is from faith that imagination draws its\r\nstrength. It is by faith that it becomes complete and realized. He who\r\nbelieveth in nature, will obtain from nature to the extent of his faith.\r\nLet the object of this faith be real or imaginary, you nevertheless reap\r\nsimilar results; and hence the cause of superstition.\"\r\n\r\nCardanus, Bacon, and Van Helmont pursued this study; and the latter\r\nphysician, having cured several cases by magnetism, was considered a\r\nsorcerer, and was seized by the Inquisition. Magnetism, he observed, \"is a\r\nuniversal agent, and only novel in its appellation, and paradoxical to\r\nthose who ridicule every thing they do not comprehend, or attribute to\r\nSatan what they cannot understand. The name of magnetism is given to that\r\noccult influence which bodies possess on each other at various distances,\r\neither by attraction or by impulsion. The means or the vehicle of this\r\ninfluence is an ethereal spirit, pure, vital, (_magnale magnum_,) which\r\npenetrates all matter, and agitates the mass of the universe. This spirit\r\nis the moderator of the world, and establishes a correspondence between\r\nits several parts and the powers with which it is endowed. We can attach\r\nto a body the virtues that we possess, communicate to it certain\r\nproperties, and use it as the intermediate means to operate salutary\r\neffects. I have hitherto withheld the revelation of this great mystery.\r\nThere exists in man a certain energy, which can act beyond his own person\r\naccording to his will or his imagination, and impart virtues and exercise\r\na durable influence even in distant objects. Will is the first of powers.\"\r\nVan Helmont fully admitted the wonderful faculties that somnambulism\r\nseemed to develop, and informs us that it was chiefly during his sleep\r\nthat he was inspired with his doctrines. One might have imagined that\r\nthese philosophic researches would have put an effectual stop to the\r\nprogress of superstition, or rather of persecution; yet their promulgation\r\ncould not save Urbain Grandier, and many supposed sorcerers, from a\r\nbarbarous death.\r\n\r\nIt was in the beginning of the eighteenth century that various experiments\r\nwere made with the loadstone in researches regarding electricity. In 1754,\r\nLenoble had constructed magnets that could be used with facility in the\r\ntreatment of various diseases. In 1774, Father Hell, a Jesuit and\r\nprofessor of astronomy at Vienna, having cured himself of a severe\r\nrheumatism by magnetism, related the result of his experiments to Mesmer.\r\nThis physician was immediately struck with observations that illustrated\r\nhis own theories respecting planetary influence. He forthwith proceeded to\r\nprocure magnets of every form and description for the gratuitous treatment\r\nof all those that consulted him; and, while he widely diffused his\r\ndoctrines, he sent his magnets in every direction to aid the experimental\r\npursuits of others, and thus expressed himself on the subject in a memoir\r\npublished in 1779: \"I had maintained that the heavenly spheres possessed a\r\ndirect power on all the constituent principles of animated bodies,\r\nparticularly on the _nervous system_, by the agency of an all-penetrating\r\nfluid. I determined this action by the INTENSION and the REMISSION of the\r\nproperties of matter and organized bodies, such as gravity, cohesion,\r\nelasticity, irritability, and electricity. I supported this doctrine by\r\nvarious examples of periodical revolutions; and I named that property of\r\nthe animal matter, which renders it susceptible to the action of celestial\r\nand earthly bodies, ANIMAL MAGNETISM. A further consideration of the\r\nsubject led me to the conviction that there does exist in nature an\r\nuniversal principle, which, independently of ourselves, performs all that\r\nwe vaguely attribute to nature or to art.\"\r\n\r\nMesmer, as might have been foreseen, became the object of persecution and\r\nof ridicule, and withdrew to Switzerland and Suabia. It was there that he\r\nmet with a certain Gassner of Braz, who, having fancied that an exorcism\r\nhad relieved him from a long and painful malady, took it into his head to\r\nexorcise others. He considered the greater part of the disorders, to which\r\nflesh is heir as the work of the devil, and he counteracted his baneful\r\ninfluence in the name of our SAVIOUR. He divided these diabolical\r\nvisitations into _possessions_, _obsessions_, and _circumsessions_; the\r\nlatter being trifling invasions. For the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nhis patients laboured under natural or infernal ailments, he conjured\r\nSatan to declare the truth. If, after three solemn interpellations, and\r\nsigns of the cross, the devil did not answer, the disorder was considered\r\nas coming within the province of medicine; but if, on the contrary, the\r\npatient fell into convulsions, Gassner drew forth his stole and crucifix,\r\nand, in the name of the Redeemer, commenced rubbing and pinching,\r\nsometimes in the most indecorous manner, when females were submitted to\r\nhis manipulations. When his attempts failed, he accused the patient of\r\nwant of faith or of the commission of some deadly sin, which baffled his\r\nendeavours. His fame became so universal, that the Bishop of Ratisbon sent\r\nfor him, and he exercised his art under his auspices. At one period, the\r\ntown was so crowded with his patients, that ten thousand of them were\r\nobliged to encamp without the walls. It appears that this adventurer had\r\nthe power of acting upon the pulse, and could increase or retard it,\r\nrender it regular or intermittent, and was even reported to paralyze limbs\r\nand produce tears or laughter at will. It is scarcely credible, yet the\r\ncelebrated De Haen, one of the most distinguished and learned\r\npractitioners in Germany, not only believed in the power of this Gassner,\r\nbut actually attributed it to a paction with the devil.\r\n\r\nMesmer was not so credulous, and explained the miraculous cures of Gassner\r\nby the doctrines of the animal magnetism which he advocated. From Suabia\r\nhe returned to Vienna, whence he was expelled as a quack; and in 1778\r\narrived at Paris, a capital that had patronised Cagliostro and St.\r\nGermain, and was ever ready to be deceived by ingenious empiricism. In\r\n1779 he published a paper on the subject, in which he maintained\r\ntwenty-seven propositions to establish his supposed influence between the\r\ncelestial bodies, the earth, and animated matter, produced by a fluid\r\nuniversal, subtile, susceptible of receiving, transmitting, and\r\ncommunicating its impressions, on mechanical principles, until then\r\nunknown, and producing alternate effects of flux and reflux. This powerful\r\nagent, he said, acted chiefly on the nervous system. The human body,\r\nmoreover, according to his notions, possessed properties analogous to the\r\nloadstone, and presenting an opposed polarity, subject to various\r\nmodifications, which either strengthened or weakened it. The action of\r\nanimal magnetism, according to him, was not confined to animal matter, but\r\ncould be equally communicated to inanimate bodies at various distances.\r\nMirrors could reflect and increase its power like the rays of light, and\r\nsound could propagate and increase it. This magnetic property, he further\r\nstated, could be accumulated, concentrated, and transported at pleasure,\r\nalthough there did exist animated bodies possessed of properties so\r\nopposite as to render this powerful agent inefficient. He found that the\r\nloadstone was susceptible of animal magnetism, and of its opposite\r\nvirtues, without any apparent influence on its power over iron and the\r\nneedle; whence he concluded that there existed a wide difference between\r\nanimal and mineral magnetism.\r\n\r\nMesmer soon found a warm advocate of his doctrines in a Dr. D'Eslon, and\r\nanimal magnetism became in fashionable vogue. Not only were men and\r\nanimals subjected to their experiments, but this wondrous influence was\r\ncommunicated to trees and plants, and the celebrated elm-tree of Beaugency\r\nwas magnetized by the Marquis de Puysegur and his brother; while the\r\nenthusiastic D'Eslon absolutely went knocking from door to door to procure\r\npatients. Breteuil, who was then one of the ministers, offered Mesmer a\r\nyearly pension of thirty thousand francs, with a sum of three hundred\r\nthousand francs in cash, with the decoration of St. Michael, if he would\r\nconsent to reveal the mysteries of his science to the medical faculty.\r\nThis tempting offer our magnetizer indignantly rejected, and a secret\r\nsociety was instituted under the name of the Lodge and Order of Harmony.\r\nThe charms and the power of youth and music were not neglected as\r\nauxiliaries to propagate the fashionable doctrine. Young men of elegant\r\nmanners and athletic form were initiated in the practice of magnetizing,\r\nand the _salons_ of Paris consecrated to this worship (for such it might\r\nhave been termed) were crowded with the most fascinating women that the\r\ngay metropolis of France could produce. Most of these females, impassioned\r\nby nervous excitability, as loose in their morals as to outward appearance\r\nthey were fervent in their devotions, abandoned themselves without reserve\r\nto the delightful sensations that magnetism and its surrounding machinery\r\nwere said to afford. In their ecstasies, their hysteric attacks, their\r\nspasms, Mesmer, the high-priest, fancifully dressed, but in the height of\r\nfashion, with his useful acolytes, endeavoured to soothe and calm the\r\nagitation of their enchanting patients by all the means that Mesmerism\r\ncould devise.\r\n\r\nIt soon became pretty evident that these phenomena were solely to be\r\nattributed to the influence of imagination; and Doppet, one of the most\r\nardent disciples of the new creed, frankly avowed that \"those who were\r\ninitiated in the secrets of Mesmer entertained more doubts on the subject\r\nthan those who were in thorough ignorance of them.\" Notwithstanding this\r\nevidence brought forward against Mesmer's fascinating practice, he was\r\nwarmly eulogised even by high churchmen; and Hervier, a doctor of\r\nSorbonne, did not hesitate to assert that the Golden Age was on the\r\nreturn; that man would be endowed with fresh vigour, live for the space of\r\nfive generations, and only succumb to the exhaustion of age; that all the\r\nanimal kingdom would enjoy a similar blessing; while magnetized trees\r\nwould yield more abundant and delicious fruits. This belief of the good\r\necclesiastic arose, according to his own assertion, from his having been\r\ncured of some cruel disorder by magnetism, while all his intimate\r\nacquaintances insisted that he had never ceased to enjoy perfect health.\r\n\r\nSuch were the circumstances that attended the introduction of animal\r\nmagnetism, which to this day is defended and maintained by ardent\r\nproselytes. Sound philosophy can only attribute its wonderful phenomena,\r\nmany of which cannot be denied, to the influence of the imagination, and\r\nthe all-powerful deceptive agency of faith. It is an incontrovertible\r\nfact, that the nervous system may be so worked upon, thrown by various\r\nsecret and physical means into such a morbid condition, that results\r\nbordering upon the miraculous in the eyes of the credulous may be easily\r\nobtained. Every circumstance that appears to differ from the usual course\r\nof nature is deemed miraculous by the ignorant; and the Greek proverb\r\n[Greek: thaumata morois], plainly maintains that miracles are only for the\r\nsimple. In fact, who are the persons who in our times cry out \"miracle,\"\r\nbut weak and timid men, worn out by excesses or age, labouring under the\r\ninfluence of terror; silly old women, who have not the power of reasoning;\r\nor nervous and enthusiastic females, who seek for some saving clauses in a\r\npact between vice and virtue, depravity and religion.\r\n\r\nAll the wonders of the creation are miraculous, if we are to consider\r\nthose phenomena that are, and most probably will ever remain, beyond our\r\nhumble and miserable comprehension to be such. The manifestations of the\r\nCreator's will are daily exhibited in stupendous forms that strike the\r\nignorant with awe, while they lead the man of science to bow in grateful\r\nveneration to that Almighty power that has harmonized the creation for our\r\nwellbeing, if we would only obey the sublime dictates of his laws, without\r\nattempting to scrutinize their spirit by quibbling with their letter.\r\n\r\nThere can be but little doubt that the wonders of magnetism may be\r\nreferred to the imagination; yet some of the phenomena must excite our\r\nsurprise, and may occasion some degree of hesitation in invariably\r\nattributing its results to fancy. The Academy of Medicine of Paris having\r\nappointed a commission of twelve members to examine and report upon it,\r\ntheir inferences were as follow:\r\n\r\n1. The effects of magnetism were not evident in healthy persons, and in\r\n_some_ invalids.\r\n\r\n2. They were _scarcely_ apparent in others.\r\n\r\n3. They _often_ appeared to be the result of ennui, monotony, and the\r\ninfluence of imagination.\r\n\r\n4. Lastly, _they are developed independently of these causes, very\r\nprobably by the effects of magnetism alone_.\r\n\r\nThe points of this report that I have printed in italics prove most\r\nclearly that the members of the commission, all of whom were decidedly\r\nadverse to the doctrine, were convinced, at least to a certain extent, by\r\nthe experiments they had witnessed, of some singular powers residing in\r\nthis mysterious science. Such must have been the case, since we find three\r\nmembers seceding from their associates, Laennec, Double, and Magendie, all\r\nwell known as distinguished physiologists, somewhat inclined to pure\r\nmaterialism, and what may be termed _matter-of-fact_ men, who would\r\nhesitate in yielding their belief to any assertion that the scalpel could\r\nnot demonstrate. Notwithstanding the protest of these gentlemen, the\r\nfollowing were the conclusions of the commission:\r\n\r\n1. Contact of the thumbs and magnetic movements are the means of relative\r\ninfluence employed to transmit magnetic action.\r\n\r\n2. Magnetism acts on persons of different age and sex.\r\n\r\n3. Many effects appear to depend on magnetism alone, and are not\r\nreproduced without it.\r\n\r\n4. These effects are various. Sometimes magnetism agitates, at other times\r\nit calms. It generally causes acceleration of the pulse and respiration,\r\nslight convulsive movements, somnolency, and, in a few cases,\r\nsomnambulism.\r\n\r\n5. The existence of peculiar characters of somnambulism has not yet been\r\nproved.\r\n\r\n6. It may, however, be inferred that this state of somnambulism prevails\r\nwhen we notice the development of new faculties, such as _clairvoyance_\r\nand intuitive foresight, or when it produces changes in the physiological\r\ncondition of the individual, such as insensibility, sudden increase of\r\nstrength, since these effects cannot be attributed to any other cause.\r\n\r\n7. When the effects of magnetism have been produced, there is no occasion\r\non subsequent trials to have recourse to _passes_.[42] The look of the\r\nmagnetizer and his will have the same influence.\r\n\r\n8. Various changes are effected in the perceptions and faculties of those\r\npersons in whom somnambulism has been induced.\r\n\r\n9. Somnambulists have distinguished with closed eyes objects placed before\r\nthem. They have, then, read words, recognised colours, named cards, &c.\r\n\r\n10. In two somnambulists we witnessed the faculty of foreseeing acts of\r\nthe organism to take place at periods more or less distant. One announced\r\nthe day, the hour, and the minute of the invasion and recurrence of an\r\nepileptic fit; the other foresaw the period of his recovery. Their\r\nanticipations were realized.\r\n\r\n11. We have only seen one somnambulist who had described the symptoms of\r\nthe diseases in three individuals presented to her.\r\n\r\n12. In order to establish justly the relations of magnetism with\r\ntherapeutics, one must have observed the effects on a number of\r\nindividuals, and have made experiments on sick persons. Not having done\r\nthis, the commissioners can only say, they have seen too few cases to\r\nenable them to form a decisive opinion.\r\n\r\n13. Considered as an agent of physiological phenomena, or of therapeutics,\r\nmagnetism should find a place in the range of medical science, and be\r\neither practised, or its employment superintended by a physician.\r\n\r\n14. From the want of sufficient opportunities, the commission could not\r\nverify the existence of any other faculties in somnambulists; but its\r\nreports contain facts sufficiently important to conclude that the Academy\r\nought to encourage researches in animal magnetism, as a curious fact of\r\npsychology and natural history.\r\n\r\nThis report was impugned by Mr. Dubois, in what he calls his rational\r\nconclusions, which of course maintain that those of the commission were\r\nirrational. However, in this paper he merely affirms his own incredulity,\r\nwithout supporting it upon any grounds of experiment or observation; and\r\ntherefore his observations must be considered an individual attempt to\r\nrefute the assertions of a body of scientific men, who, after diligently\r\nand maturely weighing the arguments in favour of a doctrine that they were\r\npreviously disposed to condemn as unworthy of research, came to the\r\nconclusions that we have seen.\r\n\r\nWhile the French Academy did not consider it beneath their dignity to\r\ninvestigate this doctrine, in other parts of Europe it attracted the\r\nattention both of the reigning monarchs and the most distinguished\r\nphysicians. In Prussia, Hufeland, who had been one of the warmest\r\nopponents of magnetism, became a convert; and a clinical hospital was\r\nestablished in Berlin, by order of the government, to observe and record\r\nits phenomena. At Frankfort and Groningen, Drs. Passavant and Bosker\r\npublished works on the subject; the latter having translated the critical\r\nhistory of Deleuze. At Petersburg, Dr. Stoffreghen, first physician of the\r\nEmperor, pronounced himself with several colleagues in its favour; and\r\nmost of these distinguished men seemed to partake of the opinion of the\r\njustly celebrated Orfila, who certainly may be considered as an authority,\r\nand who thus expressed himself on the subject:\r\n\r\n\"If there exists trickery and quackery in animal magnetism, its\r\nadversaries are too hasty in refusing to admit all that has been asserted\r\nin regard to its effects. The testimony of enlightened physicians should\r\nbe considered as proofs. If the magnetic phenomena appear extraordinary,\r\nthe phenomena of electricity appeared equally marvellous in its origin.\r\nWas Franklin to be considered a quack when he announced that with a\r\npointed metal he could command thunder? Whether magnetism acts in good or\r\nin evil, it is clearly a therapeutic agent, and it behoves both the honour\r\nand the duty of the Academy to examine it.\"\r\n\r\nSuch is the present state of this curious science. To what credit it may\r\nbe entitled, and how far it may become a useful medical agent, experience\r\nalone can decide. At the same time, it would be unjust to assert, in our\r\npresent ignorance, that all the learned and independent men who support it\r\nare either fools or knaves.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS FISHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe deleterious qualities of certain fishes have long been the subject of\r\nmedical conjectures. It is somewhat singular, and most difficult to\r\naccount for, that the same fish should be wholesome in some waters, and\r\ndeadly in others, although under the same latitude, and when, to all\r\nappearance at least, no local cause can be discovered to which we might\r\nreasonably attribute this fatal property. So powerful and prompt moreover,\r\nit is in its action that rapid death will ensue whenever a small portion\r\nof the fish has been eaten. Such, for instance, is generally the case with\r\nthe yellow-bill sprat, the _clypea thrissa_.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists attribute this poison to copper banks, on or near which\r\nthe fish may feed. The absurdity of this opinion has been fully\r\ndemonstrated; in the first instance, no such copper banks have been\r\ndiscovered in the West Indies, and these fish abound on the coasts of\r\nislands of coral formation. Moreover, it is not likely that this mineral\r\nshould saturate the animal; and, even if it could produce this effect, the\r\nentire body would in all probability be affected, whereas the poison seems\r\nto lie in particular parts, chiefly in the intestines, the liver, the fat,\r\n&c. This is evident from the practice of fishermen, who can eat poisonous\r\nfish with impunity if they have taken the precaution to draw them\r\ncarefully and salt them. In addition to these observations, the symptoms\r\nof the disease thus produced, by no means resemble those of mineral\r\npoisons. Dr. Chisholm, who pretends that copper banks do exist in the\r\nWindward Islands, is of this opinion. Admitting the facts, it may be\r\nasked, have the waters of these seas been impregnated by the copper? if\r\nthey are not, how can its influence extend to its inhabitants? and why are\r\nparticular fish only affected? Moreover, although it is well known that\r\ncertain substances are deleterious to some animals and harmless to others,\r\nyet one might fancy that, if the coppery principal of an animal's flesh\r\ncould poison, it is not irrational to think that the same deadly substance\r\nwould also destroy the animal. The presence of this mineral has never been\r\ndetected by any chemical test; and, if the poison consisted in copper, how\r\ncould salting the fish destroy it? In opposition to these objections, it\r\nhas been maintained that fish may be rendered poisonous by feeding on the\r\nmarine plants that grow upon these deadly banks. Now, unless it could be\r\nproved that copper is not injurious to fish, these same lithophyta and\r\nzoophyta would no doubt poison them.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is more than probable that it is to a certain injurious food\r\nthat these dangerous qualities are to be referred. Various plants that\r\ngrow in these regions are of a poisonous nature to man, although, as I\r\nhave just observed, they may not be so destructive to fish. The\r\ncircumstance of the alimentary tube being more poisonous than any other\r\npart seems to warrant the conclusion; and I have observed in the West\r\nIndies, that the crabs that feed upon banks where the manchineel is to be\r\nfound, frequently occasion serious, and sometimes fatal accidents. On the\r\ncoast of Malabar, crabs are poisonous in the month of October, when the\r\n_blue tithymale_ abounds.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the causes of this deadly principle, the effects are most\r\nrapid. When a large quantity has been taken, the patient soon dies in\r\nstrong convulsions; but frequently, when the quantity and the nature of\r\nthe poison have not been sufficient to occasion death, the body becomes\r\nemaciated, the cuticle peels off, particularly on the palms of the hands\r\nand the soles of the feet, the hair drops, acute pains shoot through every\r\njoint, and the sufferer not unfrequently sinks under a lingering disease.\r\nIn these cases change of climate has been found the most effectual remedy,\r\nand a return to Europe becomes indispensable.\r\n\r\nThe usual symptoms that denote the presence of the poison, are languor,\r\nheaviness, drowsiness, great restlessness, flushing of the face, nausea,\r\ngriping, a burning sensation, at first experienced in the face and eyes,\r\nand then extending over the whole body; the pulse, at first hard and\r\nfrequent, soon sinks, and becomes slow and feeble. In some cases the\r\nsalivary glands become tumefied with a profuse salivation; and the body,\r\nand its perspiration, are as yellow as in the jaundice. These peculiar\r\nsymptoms have frequently been known to arise after eating the _rock-fish_.\r\n\r\nThe remedies that are usually resorted to are stimulants. Capsicum has\r\nbeen considered a powerful antidote; and the use of ardent spirits or\r\ncordials has also been strongly urged. It has been observed, that persons\r\nwho had drunk freely, or who had taken a dram after eating fish that had\r\ndisordered others, were, comparatively speaking, exempt from the severity\r\nof the disease. A decoction of the root of the _sour-sop_, and an infusion\r\nof the flowers of the _white cedar_ and the _sensitive plant_ have also\r\nbeen advised by several West India practitioners.\r\n\r\nThe practice of putting a silver spoon in the water in which fish is\r\nboiled, to ascertain its salubrity, is a popular test that cannot be\r\ndepended on. Fishermen have observed that fish that have no scales are\r\nmore apt to prove injurious; and those of uncommon size are looked upon as\r\nthe most dangerous.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain whether the nature of the fishes' food could thus render them\r\npoisonous, Mr. Moreau de Jonnes had recourse to many curious experiments.\r\nHe took portions of polypes found in the waters reputed dangerous, more\r\nparticularly the _liriozoa Caribaea_, the _millepora polymorpha_, the\r\n_gorgonia pinnata_, the _actinia anemone_, &c., and, having enveloped them\r\nin paste, he fed fishes with them; but in no one instance was any\r\nprejudicial result observed. He tried in the same manner the _physalis\r\npelagica_ of Lamark, which contains an acrid and caustic fluid; but the\r\nfish invariably refused it, nor would they touch fragments of the\r\nmanchineel apple.\r\n\r\nOysters have been known to produce various accidents; and, when they were\r\nof a green colour, it has been supposed that this peculiarity was also due\r\nto copper banks. This is an absurdity; the green tinge is as natural to\r\nsome varieties as to the _esox belone_, whose bones are invariably of the\r\nsame hue as verdigrise. Muscles frequently occasion feverish symptoms,\r\nattended with a red, and sometimes a copper-coloured, efflorescence over\r\nthe whole body. These accidents appear to arise from some peculiar\r\ncircumstances. In Boulogne I attended a family in which all the children\r\nwho had eaten muscles were labouring under this affection, while not\r\nanother instance of it was observed in the place. In the Bahama Islands I\r\nwitnessed a fatal case in a young girl who had eaten crabs; she was the\r\nonly sufferer, although every individual in the family had shared in the\r\nmeal. The idea of the testaceous mollusca avoiding copper-bottomed\r\nvessels, while they are found in abundance on those that are not sheathed,\r\nis absurd; this circumstance can be easily explained by the greater\r\nfacility these creatures find in adhering to wood. There is every reason\r\nto believe, that the supposed poisonous oysters found adhering to the\r\ncopper bottom of a ship in the Virgin Isles, and the occasional accidents\r\namongst the men that ate them, were only so in the observer's imagination,\r\nand that part of the ship's company were affected by some other causes.\r\nAnother report, equally absurd, was that of the fish having gradually\r\nquitted the Thames and Medway since coppering ships' bottoms has been\r\nintroduced! The following may be considered the fish that should be\r\navoided:\r\n\r\n  The Spanish mackerel,     _Scomber caeruleo-argenteus_.\r\n  The yellow-billed sprat,  _Clupea thrissa_.\r\n  The baracuta,             _Esox baracuta_.\r\n  Grey snapper,             _Coracinus fuscus_.\r\n  The porgie,               _Sparus chrysops_.\r\n  The king-fish,            _Scomber maximus_.\r\n  The hyne,                 _Coracinus minor_.\r\n  Bottle-nosed cavallo,     _Scomber_.\r\n  Old wife,                 _Balistes monoceros_.\r\n  Conger eel,               _Muraena major_.\r\n  Sword-fish,               _Xiphias gladius_.\r\n  Smooth bottle-fish,       _Ostracion globellum_.\r\n  Rock-fish,                _Perca manna_.\r\n\r\nI have known accidents arise from the use of the dolphin on the high seas;\r\nand, while I was in the West Indies, a melancholy instance of the kind\r\noccurred, when the captain, mate, and three seamen of a trading vessel\r\ndied from the poison; a passenger, his wife, and a boy, were the only\r\nsurvivors, and were fortunately picked up in the unmanageable vessel.\r\n\r\nThe above catalogue of poisonous fishes is extracted from Dr. Dancer's\r\n\"Jamaica Practice of Physic,\" and its correctness fell under my own\r\nobservation in the Wrest Indies. The different systems and classifications\r\nof ichthyologists have produced much confusion, and may lead to fatal\r\nerrors; I think it therefore advisable to submit to travellers, who may\r\nhave to visit these unhealthy regions, the names of the _toxicophorous_\r\nfishes according to the French momenclature.\r\n\r\n  Le poisson arme,          _Diodon orbicularis_.\r\n  La lune,                  _Tetraodon mola_.--LINN.\r\n  Le tetraodon ocelle,      _T. ocellatus_.\r\n  Le t. scelerat,           _T. scelreatus_.\r\n  La vieille,               _Balistes vetula_.\r\n  La petite vieille,      { _B. monoceros_.--LINN.\r\n                          { _Alutus monoceros_.--CUVIER.\r\n  Le coffre triangulaire,   _Ostracion trigonus_.--BLOCH.\r\n  La grande orphie,         _Esox Brasiliensis_.--LINN.\r\n  La petite orphie,         _E. marginatus_.--LACEPEDE.\r\n  Le congre,                _Muraena conger_.--MINN.\r\n  Le perroquet,             _Sparus psittacus_.--LACEPEDE.\r\n  Le capitaine,             _S. erythrinus_.--BLOCH.\r\n  La becune,                _Sphyraena becuna_.\r\n  Le thon,                  _Scomber thynnus_.--LINN.\r\n  La carangue,              _Caranx carangus_.\r\n\r\nA work, in which a _synonymous_ catalogue of all the fishes supposed to be\r\npoisonous might be found, would be highly desirable, as they generally\r\nbear different popular and scientific names, thus producing a dangerous\r\nconfusion even amongst naturalists; how much more dangerous amongst\r\nseafaring people and voyagers!\r\n\r\nI cannot conclude this article without noticing the singular properties of\r\nthose electric fishes denominated the _torpedo-ray_ and the _gymnote_.\r\nThey had been long known to naturalists, and the ancients attributed their\r\ndestructive faculties to a magic power that Oppian had recorded in his\r\n_Alieuticon_, where he describes a fisherman palsied through the hook, the\r\nline, and the rod. This influence being voluntary on the part of the\r\nanimal, seemed to warrant the belief in its mischievous nature, since it\r\nallows itself sometimes to be touched with impunity, while at others it\r\nburrows itself under the sand of the beach, when the tide has receded, and\r\nmaliciously benumbs the astonished passenger who walks over it. This\r\nsingular fish, which is common in the Mediterranean Sea, has been\r\ndescribed both by the Greek and Roman writers; amongst others, by\r\nAristotle and Athenaeus: and Socrates, in his Dialogues, compares a\r\npowerful objection, to the influence of the torpedo.\r\n\r\nThis voluntary faculty has been observed by Lacepede and Cloquet in the\r\nMediterranean, and at La Rochelle. In torpedos kept in water for\r\nexperimental purposes, Reaumur found that he handled them without\r\nexperiencing any shock for some time, until they at last appeared to\r\nbecome impatient: he then experienced a stunning sensation along the arm,\r\nnot easily to be described, but resembling that which is felt when a limb\r\nhas been struck with a sudden blow. One of the experiments of this\r\nnaturalist proved the extensive power of this faculty. He placed a torpedo\r\nand a duck in a vessel containing sea-water, covered with linen to prevent\r\nthe duck from escaping, without impeding the bird's respiration. At the\r\nexpiration of a few minutes the animal was found dead, having been killed\r\nby the electric shocks of its enemy.\r\n\r\nRedi was the first who demonstrated this faculty. Having laid hold of a\r\ntorpedo recently caught, he had scarcely touched it, when he felt a\r\ncreeping sensation shooting up to the shoulder, followed by an unpleasant\r\ntremor, with a lancinating pain in the elbow. These sensations he\r\nexperienced as often as he touched the animal; but this faculty gradually\r\ndecreased in strength as the animal became exhausted and dying. These\r\nexperiments he related in a work entitled \"_Esperienze intorno a diverse\r\ncose naturali_.\" Florence, 1671.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, Walsh made some very interesting experiments at the Isle of Re\r\nand La Rochelle, and clearly demonstrated this electric faculty in a paper\r\n_On the electric property of the torpedo_. In one of them he found that\r\nthis fish could produce from forty to fifty shocks in the course of ninety\r\nminutes. The electrified individuals were isolated; and at each shock the\r\nanimal gave, it appeared to labour under a sense of contraction, when its\r\neyes sunk deep in their sockets.\r\n\r\nThe _trichiurus electricus_ of Linnaeus, the _rhinobatus electricus_ of\r\nSchneider, and the _gymnonotus electricus_ of _Surinam_, are the species\r\nof this singular fish with which experiments have chiefly been made. The\r\n_gymnonotus_ is a kind of eel, five or six feet in length, and its\r\nelectric properties are so powerful that it can throw down men and horses.\r\nThis animal is rendered more terrific from the velocity of his powers of\r\nnatation, thus being able to discharge its thunder far and near. When\r\ntouched with one hand the shock is slight; but when grasped with both, it\r\nis so violent that, according to the accounts of Collins Flag, the\r\nelectric fluid can paralyze the arms of the imprudent experimentalist for\r\nseveral years. This electric action is analogous to that which is obtained\r\nby means of the fulminating plate, which is made of glass with metallic\r\nplates. Twenty-seven persons holding each other by the hands, and forming\r\na chain, the extremities of which corresponded with the points of the\r\nfish's body, experienced a smart shock. These shocks are produced in quick\r\nsuccession, but become gradually weaker as the fluid appears to be\r\nexhausted. Humboldt informs us, that, to catch this fish, wild horses are\r\ndriven into the water, and after having expended the fury and the vigour\r\nof the gymnonotus, fishermen step in and catch them either with nets or\r\nharpoons. Here we find that the irritable or sensorial power is exhausted\r\nthrough the medium of electricity. These phenomena may be attributed to an\r\nelectric or Voltaic aura; and the organ of the animal that secretes the\r\nfluid resembles in its wonderful structure the Voltaic apparatus. Both the\r\ngymnote and the torpedo obey the laws of electricity, and their action is\r\nlimited to the same conducting and non-conducting mediums. The electric\r\nsparks proceeding from the gymnote have been plainly seen in a dark\r\nchamber by Walsh, Pringle, Williamson, and others. The fish has four\r\nelectric organs, two large and two small ones, extending on each side of\r\nthe body from the abdomen to the end of the tail. These organs are of\r\nsuch a size that they constitute one third of the fish's bulk. Each of\r\nthem is composed of a series of aponeurotic membranes, longitudinal,\r\nparallel, horizontal, and at about one line's distance from each other.\r\nHunter counted thirty-four of these fasciculi in one of the largest. Other\r\nmembranes or plates traverse these vertically, and nearly at a right\r\nangle; thus forming a plexus or net-work of numerous rhomboidal cells.\r\nHunter found no less than two hundred and forty of these vertical plates\r\nin the space of eleven inches.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus, analogous to the Voltaic pile, is brought into action by a\r\nsystem of nerves rising from the spinal marrow, each vertebra giving out a\r\nbranch; other branches, rising from a large nerve, running from the basis\r\nof the cranium to the extremity of the tail. All these ramifications are\r\nspread and developed in the cells of the electric organs, to transmit its\r\npowerful fluid, and strike with stupor or with death every animal that\r\ncomes within its reach. Lacepede has justly compared this wonderful\r\nmechanism to a battery formed of a multitude of folio-electric pieces.\r\n\r\nThe electric organ of the _malapterus electricus_ is of a different\r\nformation. This fish, found in the Nile and in other rivers of Africa, is\r\ncalled by the Arabs _raash_ or thunder. In this animal the electric fluid\r\nextends all round the body, immediately under the integuments, and\r\nconsists of a tissue of cellular fibres so dense, that it might be\r\ncompared to a layer of bacon; but, when carefully examined, it consists of\r\na series of fibres forming a complex net-work. These cells, like those in\r\nthe gymnote, are lubricated with a mucous secretion. The nervous system of\r\nthis intricate machinery is formed by the two long branches of the\r\npneumo-gastric nerves, which in fishes usually run under each lateral\r\nline. Here, however, they approach each other on leaving the cranium,\r\ntraversing the first vertebra.\r\n\r\nLinnaeus had classed the torpedo in the genus _ray_, and hence called it\r\n_raia torpedo_. Later naturalists have restored to it its ancient name, as\r\ngiven by Pliny, and termed it _torpedo_, of which four species are\r\ndescribed: the _T. narke_, or with five spots; the _T. unimaculata_,\r\nmarked, as the name indicates, with one spot; the _T. marmorata_, and the\r\n_T. Galvanni_.\r\n\r\nThe ancients placed much faith in the medicinal properties of these\r\nfishes. Hippocrates recommends its roasted flesh in dropsies that follow\r\nliver affections. Dioscorides prescribed its application in cases of\r\nobstinate headaches and rheumatisms. Galen and other physicians recommend\r\nthe application of the living animal; and Scribonius Largus states that\r\nthe freedman Anteroes was cured of the gout by this practice. To this day,\r\nin Abyssinia, fever patients are tied down on a table, and a torpedo is\r\napplied to various parts of the body. This operation, it is affirmed,\r\ncauses great pain, but is an infallible remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEMORY AND THE MENTAL FACULTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis noble faculty, the proudest attribute of mankind, justly called the\r\nmother of the Muses, is subject to be impaired by various physical and\r\nmoral causes, while a similar agency can sometimes restore it to its\r\npristine energy, or develope its powers when sluggish and defective.\r\nMemory may be considered as the history of the past chronicled in our\r\nminds, to be consulted and called upon whenever circumstances stances or\r\nthe strange complication of human interests demand its powerful aid. Its\r\npowers and nature widely differ, and these varieties depend upon\r\neducation, natural capacities, mode of living, and pursuits. Thus memory\r\nhas been divided into that faculty that applies to facts, and to that more\r\nsuperficial quality that embraces a recollection of things, to which must\r\nbe added the memory of localities and words: \"Lucullus habuit divinam\r\nquamdam memoriam rerum, verborum majorem Hortensius,\" said Cicero.\r\n\r\nIt is on this division that Aristotle founded his belief that the brute\r\ncreation had not the faculty of reminiscence, although he allowed them to\r\npossess memory. According to his doctrine, reminiscence is the power of\r\nrecollecting an object by means of a syllogistic chain of thought; an\r\nintellectual link with which animals do not seem to be gifted. Their\r\nmemory appears solely to consist of the impressions received by the return\r\nof circumstances of a similar kind. Thus, a horse that has started on a\r\ncertain part of a road will be apt to evince the same apprehension when\r\npassing the same spot. This is an instinctive fear, but not the result of\r\ncalculation or the combination of former ideas. Reminiscence is the\r\nrevival of memory by reflection; in short, the recovery or recollection of\r\nlost impressions.\r\n\r\nThe recollection of things or facts can alone bring forth a sound\r\njudgment. It implies a regular co-ordination of ideas, a catenation of\r\nreflections, in which circumstances are linked with each other. The chain\r\nbroken, no conclusion can be drawn. Newton was wont to lose the thread of\r\nan important conversation when his mind was in search of an idea. This is\r\nthe reason why the society of the learned is seldom entertaining to the\r\ngenerality of men. They are considered absent, while their brain is busily\r\nemployed in pursuits perhaps of great importance; they must therefore be\r\nanything but agreeable to those who generally think through the medium of\r\nother persons' brains.\r\n\r\nThe brain is considered to be the seat of memory. When it is injured,\r\nremembrance is impaired; and, on the other hand, an accident has been\r\nknown to improve the recollective faculties. A man remarkable for his bad\r\nmemory fell from a considerable height upon his head; ever after he could\r\nrecollect the most trifling circumstance. The effects of different\r\nmaladies will also produce various results on this faculty. In some\r\ninstances names of persons and things are completely forgotten or\r\nmisapplied; at other times, words beginning with a vowel cannot be found.\r\nSudden fright and cold have produced the same effects. An elderly man fell\r\noff his horse in crossing a ford in a winter's night; ever afterward he\r\ncould not bring to his recollection the names of his wife and children,\r\nalthough he did not cease to recognise and love them as fondly as before\r\nthe accident. Cold has been at all times considered injurious to memory;\r\nhence Paulus Aeginus called Oblivion the child of Cold.\r\n\r\nIn fevers, and a state of great debility, in a disordered condition of the\r\ndigestive functions, and various affections of the head, we generally find\r\nthat the attention cannot long be applied to any one subject or a\r\ncontinued train of thoughts; all past circumstances are readily forgotten,\r\nwhile passing occurrences are most acutely observed and felt, excepting in\r\ncases of delirium, when we have the perception of surrounding objects or\r\nreceive an erroneous impression of their nature and agency. In many cases\r\nof this nature, we find that conversation produces great excitement and\r\nincreases the evil, for the subject of such intercourse is generally\r\nmisconceived and distorted through the medium of a morbid conception,\r\nwhile the past, the present, and the future are grouped in a confused and\r\nmost heterogeneous and incoherent jumble.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have endeavoured to fix the seat of memory in various\r\nportions of the brain. The ancients fancied that it was lodged in the\r\nposterior part of the cranium; having observed that when persons\r\nendeavoured to recollect any thing, they usually scratched the back part\r\nof the head. The Arabian physicians entertained a similar belief.\r\nGratarola maintained that a great protuberance of the occiput indicated a\r\ngood memory. Gall places it above the orbitary cavity of the eye, and even\r\nbehind it. It has long been thought that persons with protuberant eyes had\r\nquick recollections. The physical condition of the brain has also been\r\nconsidered as materially affecting memory. What physiologists have called\r\na moist brain was looked upon as unfavourable to its development; and it\r\nwas therefore owing to the soft and pulpy condition of the cerebral organs\r\nin young children that the difficulty of impressing anything upon their\r\nminds arose; the same stupidity being observed in cases where water was\r\nsupposed to be lodged in the brain. While this humid state was considered\r\nas injurious to memory, dryness of the organ was also esteemed an obstacle\r\nof a similar nature; and in old age it is by this state of siccity that\r\nfailure in memory was attempted to be explained. This failure of memory as\r\nage advances may, however, be explained in a much more rational manner.\r\nOld people will bear in lively recollection the events that attended their\r\nchildhood, their youth, and manhood; it is only recent occurrences that\r\nshed a transient impression on their minds. The cause of this may be\r\nconsidered to arise from the extreme _impressionability_ that prevails in\r\nearly life, when every organ is prompt in responding to each call upon its\r\npowers; when the charms of novelty tinge with a brighter, yet a more\r\nlasting lustre, all our pleasurable sensations; when grief had not yet\r\nwrung the young heart till its fibres became callous to future pangs, when\r\nperfidy and ingratitude have shown us that all is vanity, and calm\r\nphilosophy has tutored our passions in the school of Adversity. Reason now\r\nsits upon the judgment-seat, and all that we then can wonder at that is,\r\nat any time we could have wondered at any thing. Why, then, are we to seek\r\nfor a material theory of the mind, when our daily experience shows us that\r\nit is under the influence of so many moral agents?\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, convincing proof that the brain may be materially\r\naffected, without any deterioration of the mental faculties. Dr. Ferriar\r\nmentions a man in whom the whole of the right hemisphere, that is, one\r\nhalf of the brain, was found destroyed, but who retained all his faculties\r\ntill the very moment of his death. Diemerbrook states another case where\r\nhalf a pound of matter was found in the substance of the brain. O'Hallaran\r\nrelates the history of a man who had suffered such an injury of the head,\r\nthat a large portion of his brain was removed on the right side; and\r\nextensive suppuration having taken place, an immense quantity of pus,\r\nmixed with large masses of the substance of the brain, was discharged at\r\neach dressing, through the opening. This went on for seventeen days, and\r\nit appears that nearly one half of the brain was thrown out, mixed with\r\nthe matter, yet the man retained all his intellectual faculties to the\r\nvery last moment of his dissolution, and through the whole course of the\r\ndisease, his mind maintained uniform tranquillity. I attended a soldier at\r\nBraburne Lees, who had received a wound in the head during ball practice.\r\nThe ball remained in the brain, and during three weeks large masses of\r\nbrainular substance were brought away with pus. To the last day of his\r\nlife he would relate, with every circumstantial particular, the neglect of\r\nthe comrade by whom he had been wounded, and who fired while he was\r\nrunning to the target to mark the shots. It is somewhat singular, but\r\nsuppuration of the brain is more offensive than the foulest ulcer, and it\r\nis with great difficulty that the pestilential effluvia can be tolerated.\r\nThese cases plainly show that cerebral diseases have but little influence\r\non the manifestations of the mind.\r\n\r\nAmongst the many curious doctrines that have been started, to account for\r\nthe operations of memory, some philosophers have compared it to the art of\r\nengraving; pretending that on those subjects where it requires much time\r\nand trouble to work an impression it was more durable, while it was only\r\ntraced in a superficial manner on those brains that were ever ready and\r\nsoft to receive this plastic influence. These several faculties they\r\ntherefore compared to bronze or marble, to butter and to wax. Descartes,\r\nfollowing up the phantasy, compared recollection to etching, and said that\r\nthe animal spirits, being passed over the lines previously traced, brought\r\nthem more powerfully to the mind; thus comparing the brain to the\r\nvarnished copper-plate over which the engraver passes his mordants.\r\nMalebranche endeavoured to establish another doctrine, and compared our\r\ncerebral organ to an instrument formed of a series of fibres, so arranged,\r\nthat when any recent emotion agitated one of these chords the others would\r\nimmediately be thrown into vibration, renewing a past chain of ideas. As\r\nthese chords became less flexible in old age, of course these vibrations\r\nwere more difficult to obtain. Recollection was also considered an\r\nattribute of each molecule of the brain; and Bonnet endeavoured to count\r\nhow many hundred ideas each molecule was capable of holding during a long\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe controversies of learned psychologists on the relation of memory and\r\njudgment, indeed on the analogies that exist between our several mental\r\nfaculties, have been as various as they are likely to prove interminable.\r\nWithout offending these illustrious controversionalists, we may endeavour\r\nto enumerate these faculties, which, despite the ingenuity of theorists,\r\nappear in a practical point of view to exercise a wonderful influence upon\r\neach other. The first may be considered the faculty of _perception_,\r\nassisted by that of _attention_, to which we are indebted for our _ideas_.\r\nThese are preserved and called into action from the rich stores of the\r\nmind by _memory_, justly called by Cicero the guardian of the other\r\nfaculties. _Imagination_ is the faculty of the mind that represents the\r\nimages of remembered objects as if they were actually present.\r\n_Abstraction_ forms general deductions from the foregoing faculties; while\r\n_judgment_ compares and examines the analogies and relations of the ideas\r\nof sense and of abstract notions. Finally, _reason_ draws inferences from\r\nthe comparisons of judgment.\r\n\r\nIt is from the combination and the workings of these wonderful powers that\r\n_appetency_, _desires_, _aversions_, and _volition_ arise. _Appetency_\r\noccasions _desires_, and these, when disappointed or satiated, inevitably\r\nusher in aversions and antipathies; although, as we shall see in another\r\narticle, our antipathies are frequently instinctive, and not arising from\r\nany combination of the faculties I have enumerated.\r\n\r\nDr. Gall has considered these mental faculties as fundamental; and in this\r\nview he was certainly correct, since they may be considered the source\r\nwhence all other distinct capacities are probably formed by particular\r\nhabits of study and the nature of our pursuits, independently of those\r\nspecific capacities which appear to be innate, and, according to the\r\nsystem of the phrenologists, organic. Every man possesses these\r\nfundamental faculties in a greater or less degree, according to the\r\nobtuseness or the energies of his mind; but it is absurd to conceive that\r\nspecific capacities can be brought into action without the agency of those\r\nwhich are fundamental. Let us take the instinct to destroy life, the\r\nsentiment of property, metaphysical sagacity, or poetic talent,--in short,\r\nany one of Gall's various faculties; can we for one instant conceive that\r\nthey are not under the influence of _perception_, _memory_, _imagination_,\r\nand _abstraction_, although they may not be properly ruled by _judgment_\r\nand by _reason_? Instincts are equally under a similar influence, and are,\r\naccording to circumstances, regulated by judgment in the various modes of\r\nlife of animals. Phrenologists deny that instinct is a general faculty,\r\nand assert that it is an inherent disposition to activity possessed by\r\nevery faculty, and that there are as many instincts as fundamental\r\nfaculties. This is a postulation by no means clear. Instinct is an\r\ninherent disposition possessed by every animal, but not by every faculty.\r\nIt is a disposition dependent upon the combination of all the mental\r\nfaculties, according to the degree in which the animal may possess them:\r\nthe reminiscences of animals prove it. We have instanced the horse, who\r\nendowed with the memory of locality, starts when passing by the same spot\r\nwhere he had started before. But here the memory of facts, _memoria\r\nrealis_, and probably of words, _memoria verbalis_, are superadded to the\r\n_memoria localis_. The horse recollects the tree, the carrion, the object\r\nthat startled him, whatever it might have been; but to this reminiscence\r\nare associated the chiding, the punishment he received from his rider. If\r\nthis horse had possessed the faculties of _abstraction_, _judgment_, and\r\n_reason_, he would not have started, to avoid a reiteration of punishment;\r\nbut he started under the impression of _perception_, _attention_, and\r\n_memory_. Wherever there does not exist a combination of the faculties,\r\nthe intellectual ones may be considered imperfect. We certainly may have a\r\ngreater perception and memory of one subject than of others. Thus, a man\r\nwith a musical organisation will recollect any tune he may have heard,\r\nthough it may not have attracted the _attention_ of one who \"hath no music\r\nin his soul.\" We daily perceive different talents in children educated\r\ntogether. This is, no doubt, a strong corroboration of the doctrine of\r\norganic dispositions, which in reality no philosophic observer can deny;\r\nbut to assert that these several dispositions are not regulated by what\r\nhave been called the fundamental faculties, is, I apprehend, a position\r\nthat cannot well be maintained; and we may be warranted in the conclusion\r\nthat a particular faculty may be the result of the combined action of\r\nseveral faculties, if not of all; for, whether a man be a poet or a\r\npainter, a miser or a spendthrift, an affectionate father or an assassin,\r\nevery one of the mental faculties that I have enumerated will to a\r\ncertain extent be brought into action, however morbid that action may be.\r\n\r\nAll these disquisitions, however attractive they may be, when decked out\r\nwith the fascination of the fancy, are the mere wanderings of metaphysical\r\nspeculation, that never can be proved or refuted until we attain a\r\nknowledge of the nature and quality of the perceptions which material\r\nobjects produce in the mind through the medium of the external senses. But\r\nwhile some of these speculations are idle and harmless, others may be\r\nfraught with danger, and occasion much misery to society. Let us for one\r\nmoment conceive the possibility of our resolves and actions being dictated\r\nby a supposed phrenological knowledge,--a knowledge earnestly recommended\r\nto statesmen, and indeed to mankind in general;--what would be the result?\r\nA diplomatic bungler would be sent on an embassy, because a minister, or a\r\nsovereign, with a phrenological map before him, may fancy that he displays\r\nthe faculty of circumspection, or the sense of things; and a chancellor of\r\nthe exchequer be found in some needy adventurer who possessed the organ of\r\nrelation of numbers!\r\n\r\nI do not at all presume to invalidate the statements of Dr. Gall. The\r\nprofession is highly indebted to him for his accurate description of the\r\nbrain; and physiology must ever consider him as one of the brightest\r\nornaments of science: but I do maintain, that to recommend his conclusions\r\nas a guide to society would be the most rash of visionary speculations;\r\nand, to my personal knowledge, no man was ever more mistaken in his\r\nestimate of the persons whom he met in society than the learned doctor\r\nhimself. Of this I had frequent opportunities of convincing myself, when I\r\nmet him in Paris in the circle of a Russian family which he daily visited.\r\nIf I could admit, with a late ingenious writer, \"that phrenology teaches\r\nthe true nature of man, and that its importance in medicine, education,\r\njurisprudence, and everything relating to society and conduct must be at\r\nonce apparent,\" I should certainly agree with him in recommending its\r\nstudy to parents, judges, and juries; but for the present, I am inclined\r\nto believe that, although it may prove a most interesting and valuable\r\npursuit to the physiologist, it is by no means calculated to be the _vade\r\nmecum_ of any liberal man.\r\n\r\nThe memory of various persons is amazing, and has been remarked in ancient\r\ntimes with much surprise. Cyrus knew the name of every soldier in his\r\narmy. Mithridates, who had troops of twenty-two nations serving under his\r\nbanners, became a proficient in the language of each country. Cyneas,\r\nsent on a mission to Rome by Pyrrhus, made himself acquainted in two days\r\nwith the names of all the senators and the principal citizens. Appius\r\nClaudius and the Emperor Hadrian, according to Seneca, could recite two\r\nthousand words in the order they had heard them, and afterwards repeat\r\nthem from the end to the beginning. Portius Latro could deliver all the\r\nspeeches he had hastily written without any study.\r\n\r\nEsdras is stated by historians to have restored the sacred Hebrew volumes\r\nby memory when they had been destroyed by the Chaldeans; and, according to\r\nEusebius, it is to his sole recollection that we are indebted for that\r\npart of Holy Writ. St. Anthony, the Egyptian hermit, although he could not\r\nread, knew the whole Scripture by heart: and St. Jerome mentions one\r\nNeopolien, an illiterate soldier, who, anxious to enter into monastic\r\norders, learned to recite the works of all the fathers, and obtained the\r\nname of the Living Dictionary of Christianity; while St. Antonius, the\r\nFlorentine, at the age of sixteen, could repeat all the Papal Bulls, the\r\nDecrees of Councils, and the Canons of the Church, without missing a word.\r\nPope Clement V. owed his prodigious memory to a fall on his head. This\r\naccident at first had impaired this faculty; but by dint of application he\r\nendeavoured to recover its powers, and he succeeded so completely, that\r\nPetrarch informs us he never forgot anything that he had read. John Pico\r\nde la Mirandola, justly considered a prodigy, could maintain a thesis on\r\nany subject,--_de omni re scibili_,--when a mere child; and when verses\r\nwere read to him, he could repeat them backward. Joseph Scaliger learned\r\nhis Homer in twenty-one days, and all the Latin poets in four months.\r\nHaller mentions a German scholar, of the name of Muller, who could speak\r\ntwenty languages correctly. Our own literary annals record many instances\r\nof this wonderful faculty.\r\n\r\nTo fortify this function when naturally weak, or to restore it to its\r\npristine energy when enfeebled by any peculiar circumstances, has been\r\nlong considered an essential study both by the philosopher and the\r\nphysician. Reduced to an art, this pursuit has received the name of\r\n_Mnemonia_; and at various periods professors of it, more or less\r\ndistinguished by their success, have appeared in the several capitals of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt has been justly observed, that remembrance is to the past what our\r\nsensations are to the present, and our busy conjectures to futurity.\r\nMemory gives a lesson to mankind, by stripping past events of their\r\n_prestige_; thus enabling us to view what passes around us with a more\r\ncalm and philosophic resignation, while at the same time it tends to\r\nprotect us, in the career lying before us, against the many contingencies\r\nthat are likely to impede our path. Although it might appear desirable\r\nthat we could obliterate from the mind the painful scenes of our past\r\nlife, yet the wisdom of the Creator has deemed this faculty as necessary\r\nto our happiness as our utter ignorance of our future destiny. For let us\r\nmistake not by a hasty glance on this most important subject; the\r\nremembrance of past sufferings is not always painful. On the contrary,\r\nthere is that which is holy in our past sorrows, that tends to produce a\r\ncalm, nay a pleasurable sensation of gratitude. St. Theresa beautifully\r\nexpressed this hallowed feeling when she exclaimed, \"Where are those\r\nblissful days when I felt so unhappy!\" _Et olim meminisse juvabit._\r\n\r\nMemory depends in a great measure on the vivacity with which these past\r\nscenes are retraced--I may say re-transmitted to the mind, in ideal forms\r\n\"as palpable\" as those that may be present. Therefore reminiscence may be\r\nsaid to result from a connexion between ideas and images recalled into\r\nbeing by a regular succession of expressive signs that the brute creation\r\ndo not possess. Those characteristic signs and images that are generally\r\ncircumstantial are co-ordained and classified in the mind, and tend\r\nmaterially in weak memories to produce an artificial mode of recollecting\r\nthe past. This faculty is therefore matured by habit. A literary man,\r\nwhose library is properly classed, will find the book he wants in the\r\ndark. The classification of his books is ever present to his mind. These\r\ncircumstantial signs are always remembered by a sort of association in our\r\nideas. Thus Descartes, who fondly loved a girl who squinted, was always\r\naffected with strabismus when speaking of her. When we first see a person\r\nin any particular costume, the individual is clad in the same apparel\r\nwhenever brought to our minds, even after a lapse of many years, when\r\nfashion has banished even from general recollection the costume that\r\nmemory thus retraces individually. From these observations it has been\r\nconcluded that the most probable method of improving memory would be to\r\nregulate these associations by a proper classification. One link of this\r\nideal chain will naturally lead to another. Many military men, to\r\nrecollect any number, will associate it with that of a regiment, so far at\r\nleast as the number of regiments extend; and the recollection of this\r\nparticular regiment will not only bring to his mind the number of the\r\nhouse he seeks, but various other circumstances connected both with the\r\nregiment and the number. For instance, I wish to recollect No. 87 in a\r\ncertain street. I had, when the number was mentioned to me, attached it to\r\nthe 87th regiment; and instantly I not only recollect that the 87th\r\nregiment are the Irish Fusiliers, but that they took an eagle at Barossa,\r\nwhere they distinguished themselves, and that the figure of that eagle is\r\nborne upon all the appointments of the corps. At the same moment, with the\r\nrapidity of lightning I recollect all the circumstances of the battle of\r\nBarossa; the different conversations I may have had at various times with\r\nthe officers of the 87th; the town, the camp, the bivouac where I last had\r\nmet them. Thus are innumerable circumstances instantaneously converging in\r\na mental focus while simply seeking for the lodgings of an individual.\r\nThis may be called the memory of locality, since it is locality that\r\nrevives the recollection of it.\r\n\r\nThis train of thought has also been called the memory of association, and\r\nassociations have been referred to three classes:--\r\n\r\nI. Natural or philosophical associations.\r\n\r\nII. Local or incidental associations.\r\n\r\nIII. Arbitrary or fictitious associations.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie has admirably treated this subject, and I refer the reader\r\nto his interesting work.[44] The poet Simonides is said to have been the\r\nfounder of the mnemonic art. Cicero informs us, that, supping one night\r\nwith a noble Thessalian, he was called out by two of his acquaintance, and\r\nwhile in conversation with them the roof of the house fell in, and crushed\r\nto death all the guests he had left at table. When the bodies were sought\r\nfor, they were so disfigured by the accident that they could not be\r\nrecognised even by their nearest friends; but Simonides identified them\r\nall, by merely recollecting the seats they had held at the banquet.\r\n\r\nCicero and Quintilian adopted his system, connecting the ideas of a\r\ndiscourse with certain figures. The different parts of the hilt of a\r\nsword, for instance, might regulate the details of a battle; the different\r\nparts of a tree associate the relations of a journey. Other mnemonic\r\nteachers recommended the division of ideas to correspond with the\r\ndistribution of a house; while some of them refreshed the memory by\r\nassociations connected with the fingers and other parts of the hand.\r\nCicero expresses himself plainly on this subject: \"Qui multa voluerit\r\nmeminisse, multa sibi loca comparet: oportet multos comparare locos, ut in\r\nmultis locis multas imagines collocemus.\"\r\n\r\nThe celebrated Feinagle who delivered lectures on memory had adopted the\r\nsystem of aiding the memory by dates, changing the figures in the dates\r\ninto the letters of the alphabet corresponding to them in number. These\r\nletters were then formed into a word to be in some way associated with the\r\ndate to be remembered--for instance--Henry IV., King of England, was born\r\nin the year 1366. This date changed into letters makes _mff_ which was\r\nvery easily changed into the word _muff_--the method is not so obvious of\r\nestablishing with this a relation to Henry IV., but Hen_ry_ IV., says Mr.\r\nFeinagle, means four hens, and we put them in a muff, one in each corner,\r\nand no one after hearing this is in any danger of forgetting the date of\r\nHenry IV.'s birth.\r\n\r\nLearning poetry by heart in infancy and youth is perhaps one of the best\r\nmethods of improving memory, since it lays the early foundation of a\r\nclassification of words and ideas. Virgil has justly said, \"Numeros\r\nmemini, si verba tenerem.\" To abridge, resume, and analyze what we have\r\nread or heard, is another practice highly beneficial; for, the more\r\nclearly we comprehend a subject, the deeper will it remain engraved in our\r\nmemory. Reading what we wish to recollect before going to bed will\r\nmaterially assist the memory. We sleep over the impressions we have\r\nreceived, and dreams alone can weaken them. From this very reason we can\r\nwrite with more facility upon subjects that require much mental exertion\r\nin the morning, fasting, when the mind has not been disturbed by the\r\nevents of the day, and when the functions of digestion have not drawn upon\r\nour faculties, too frequently with the lavishness of a spendthrift. It is\r\nsomewhat singular, but, despite the interruption of dreams, our ideas are\r\nmatured during our sleep. Quintilian expresses himself as follows on this\r\nsubject: \"Mirum dictu est quantum nox interposita adferat firmitatis, sive\r\nquiescit labor ille cujus sibi ipsa fatigatio obstabat, sive maturatur ac\r\ncoquatur, seu firmissima ejus pars est recordatio. Quae statim referri non\r\npoterant, contexuntur postero die, confirmatque memoriam idem illud tempus\r\nquod esse in causa solet oblivionis.\"\r\n\r\nMemory is subject to be variously disturbed in certain maladies. There is\r\nan affection called _amnesia_, in which it utterly fails, and another\r\ntermed _dysmnesia_, when it is defective. Failure of memory is generally\r\nmore manifest on some subjects than on others. Salmuth relates the case of\r\na man who had forgotten to pronounce words, although he could write them.\r\nAnother person could only recollect the first syllables. An old man had\r\nforgotten all the past events of his life, unless recalled to his\r\nrecollection by some occurrence; yet every night he regularly recollected\r\nsome one particular circumstance of his early days. A curious anecdote is\r\nrecorded of an elderly gentleman who had fallen into the meshes of an\r\nartful courtesan, and who frequently took his own wife for this insidious\r\nacquaintance, frequently saying to her, \"Madam, I feel that I am doing\r\nwrong by devoting to you so much of my time, for, when a man has a wife\r\nand children, such conduct is unpardonable;\" and, after this polite\r\nobservation, he took up his hat, and would have walked off, had not his\r\nwife, wise enough not to manifest displeasure, contrived to undeceive him.\r\n\r\nDietrich mentions a patient who remembered facts, but had totally\r\nforgotten words; while another could write, although he had lost the\r\nfaculty of reading. Old men are frequently met with who confound\r\nsubstantives, and will call their snuff-box a cane, and their watch a hat.\r\nIn other cases letters are transposed, and a musician has called his\r\n_flute_ a _tufle_. Dr. Abercrombie relates the case of a gentleman who\r\nuniformly called his snuff-box a hogshead. In Virginia he had been a\r\ntrader in tobacco, so that the transition from snuff to tobacco, and from\r\ntobacco to a hogshead seemed to be natural. Another person, affected in a\r\nsimilar manner, always called for paper when he wanted coals, and coals\r\nwhen he needed paper. Others are known to invent names and unintelligible\r\nwords. Some curious anagrams have been made by these irregularities. John\r\nHunter was suddenly attacked with a loss of memory, which is thus related\r\nby Sir Everard Home: \"He was at the time on a visit at the house of a\r\nfriend. He did not know in what part of the house he was, not even the\r\nname of the street when he was told, nor where his own house was. He had\r\nnot a conception of anything existing beyond the room in which he was, and\r\nyet he was perfectly conscious of the loss of memory. He was sensible of\r\nimpressions of all kinds from the senses, and therefore looked out of the\r\nwindow, although rather dark, to see if he could be made sensible of the\r\nsituation of the house. The loss of memory gradually went off, and in less\r\nthan half an hour his memory was perfectly recovered.\" Such momentary\r\naccidents I have frequently observed in gouty patients; and for a second\r\nor two I have myself experienced the sensation, which was for the moment\r\nof a most alarming nature. Hunter was subject to arthritic attacks.\r\n\r\nCorvinus Messala lost his memory for two years, and in his old age could\r\nnot remember his own name. This is an occurrence by no means uncommon; and\r\nI knew a person in perfect health who could only recollect his name by\r\nwriting it. We frequently see individuals who, although they are generally\r\ncorrect orthographers, cannot sometimes spell a simple conjunction. An\r\nanecdote is related in the Psychological Magazine of a German statesman,\r\nwho having called at a gentleman's house, the servants of which not\r\nknowing him, was asked for his name, which he had, however, so totally\r\nforgotten, that he was under the necessity of turning round to a friend\r\nand saying with great earnestness, \"Pray tell me who I am, for I cannot\r\nrecollect.\"\r\n\r\nCases are recorded of the forgetfulness of a language constantly spoken,\r\nwhile one nearly forgotten from want of practice was recovered. A patient\r\nin St. Thomas's Hospital, who had been admitted with a brain-fever, on his\r\nrecovery spoke an unknown language to his attendants. A Welsh milkman\r\nhappened to be in the ward, and recognised his native dialect; although\r\nthe patient had left Wales in early youth, had resided thirty years in\r\nEngland, and had nearly forgotten his native tongue. Boerhaave relates a\r\ncurious case of a Spanish poet, author of several excellent tragedies, who\r\nhad so completely lost his memory in consequence of an acute fever, that\r\nhe not only had forgotten the languages he had formerly cultivated, but\r\neven the alphabet, and was obliged to begin again to learn to read. His\r\nown former productions were shown to him, but he could not recognise them.\r\nAfterwards, however, he began once more to compose verses, which bore so\r\nstriking a resemblance to his former writings, that he at length became\r\nconvinced of his having been the author of them.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie relates the case of an aged gentleman, who, in an attack\r\nof the head, had almost forgotten the English language, and expressed\r\nhimself in a mixed dialect of French, Italian, Spanish, German, and\r\nTurkish. Having been some time afterwards severely burnt about the head,\r\nby setting fire to the curtains of his bed, he was observed to make use of\r\nsome English words; this being followed by a course of blistering, he\r\ncontinued to speak more English, but only occasionally and in very short\r\nsentences. These were sometimes correctly applied, but at other times most\r\nerroneously; for instance, having been taken to see a small house, he\r\nobserved, \"it is very neat, but it is a very little child.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Beattie mentions the case of a clergyman who, on his recovery from an\r\napoplectic attack, had exactly forgotten a period of four years; and Dr.\r\nAbercrombie records a lady who had thus forgotten ten or twelve years of\r\nher life. Wepfer mentions a gentleman, who on recovery from an apoplectic\r\nattack, was found to know nobody and remember nothing. After several weeks\r\nhe began to know his friends, to remember words, to repeat the Lord's\r\nPrayer, and to read a few words of Latin, rather than German, his native\r\nlanguage. When urged to read more than a few words at a time, he said that\r\nhe formerly understood those things, but now did not. After some time he\r\nbegan to pay more attention to what was passing around him, but while thus\r\nmaking slight and gradual progress, he was, after a few months, suddenly\r\ncut off by another attack of apoplexy. Dr. Beattie relates the case of a\r\ngentleman who, after a blow on the head, lost his knowledge of Greek, and\r\ndid not appear to have lost any thing else.\r\n\r\nLoss of memory has been observed as a frequent occurrence after the\r\nprevalence of pestilential diseases. Thucydides relates, that after the\r\nplague of Athens several of the inhabitants forgot their own names and\r\nthose of their parents and friends. After the disastrous retreat of the\r\nFrench army in Russia, and the disease which swept away so many of their\r\ntroops at Wilna, many of the survivors had no recollection of country or\r\nof home. Injuries of the head appear to occasion different results. This\r\ncircumstance was observed by the ancients. Valerius Maximus relates the\r\ncase of an Athenian, who, being struck on the head with a stone, forgot\r\nall literary attainments, although he preserved the recollection of other\r\nmatters. A man wounded with a sword in the eye completely forgot Greek and\r\nLatin, in which he had formerly been a proficient. A young man, having\r\nfallen off his horse and contused his head, lost his memory to such an\r\nextent, that he would repeat a question a hundred times over, although the\r\nvery first interrogation had been answered. He had not the slightest\r\nrecollection of his accident. Epileptic and paralytic attacks frequently\r\nusher in this melancholy result, which has also been often observed after\r\nchild-birth.\r\n\r\nDr. Abercrombie knew a lady who was seized with an apoplectic fit while\r\nengaged at cards; the attack took place on a Thursday evening--she lay in\r\na state of stupor on Friday and Saturday, and recovered her consciousness\r\nrather suddenly on Sunday. The first words she then uttered were, \"What is\r\ntrump?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Conolly mentions a young clergyman who, when on the point of being\r\nmarried, suffered an injury of the head, by which his understanding became\r\nimpaired. He lived in this condition to the advanced age of eighty, and to\r\nthe last day of his existence, spoke of nothing but his approaching\r\nwedding, expressing impatience for the arrival of the happy day.\r\n\r\nA singular instance of forgetfulness is related of a lady who had been\r\nunited to a man she loved, after much opposition on the part of her\r\nfamily, and who lost her memory after the birth of a child. She could not\r\nbe made to recollect any circumstance that had occurred since her\r\nmarriage; nor could she recognise her husband or her infant, both of whom\r\nshe maintained were utter strangers to her. At first she repulsed them\r\nwith apparent horror, but was at last, by the entreaties of her family,\r\ninduced to believe that she was a wife and a mother; and although she\r\nyielded to their solicitations, yet for years she could not persuade\r\nherself that their assertions were correct, as she actually was convinced\r\n\"against her will.\" In this instance disease not only destroyed memory,\r\nbut affection.\r\n\r\nThe case of Dr. Broussonnet was remarkable. An accident he had met with in\r\nthe Pyrenees brought on an apoplectic attack. When he recovered, he could\r\nneither write nor pronounce correctly any substantives or personal names\r\neither in French or Latin, while adjectives and epithets crowded in his\r\nmind. Thus, when speaking of a person, he would describe his appearance,\r\nhis qualities, and, without pronouncing the word \"coat,\" would name its\r\ncolour. In his botanical pursuits he could point out the form and colour\r\nof plants, but had not the power of naming them. A Parisian merchant,\r\nafter severe losses, experienced such a failure in recollection, that he\r\nwas constantly guilty of the most absurd anachronisms;--would talk of the\r\nbattles of Louis the Fourteenth with Alexander the Great, and describe\r\nCharles the Twelfth ascending triumphantly Mount Valerian; and one night,\r\nafter witnessing the performance of Talma, could not be persuaded that he\r\nhad not applauded Lekain.\r\n\r\nSudden fright has also obliterated this faculty. Artemidorus lost his\r\nmemory from the terror inspired by treading on a crocodile. Bleeding has\r\nproduced the same effects; while, on the other hand, blood-letting has\r\nrestored an absent man to perfect recollection. Various venenose\r\nsubstances have also been said to produce amnesia. History records several\r\ninstances of the kind. The soldiers of Anthony, on their return from the\r\nParthian war, were attacked with loss of memory after eating some\r\npoisonous plants on their march. Bamba, king of the Goths, was suddenly\r\ndeprived of all recollection after taking a draught presented to him by\r\nEringius. Plater and Baldinger attributed a similar accident to the use of\r\nhemlock and arsenic. Narcotics, no doubt, may produce similar effects, but\r\nthey will be of a transient nature; I do not know that this injurious\r\npower has been detected in any other productions, as the cases related by\r\nwriters are not supported by sufficient authority to be entitled to\r\nunqualified belief.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these affections will most probably ever be unknown. Equally\r\nfutile have proved all the endeavours to ascertain in what part of the\r\nbrain memory is seated, since we have found some physiologists lodging\r\nthis wonderful faculty in the posterior, and others in the anterior\r\nportion of the cranium. I apprehend that we might torture the brute\r\ncreation, from the elephant down to the lowest reptile, for centuries,\r\nwithout being able to ascertain this point; and even could we attain this\r\ninformation, _cui bono_? Would it protect this privileged quarter of the\r\ncerebral organ from the action of external agency, or restore it to its\r\nhealthy functions when diseased? The mode in which our mental faculties\r\nare developed is an impenetrable mystery; and, instead of vainly\r\nendeavouring to raise the mystic veil to gratify our curiosity, or rather\r\nour vanity, let us endeavour to apply these functions to the use for which\r\nthey were intended by the allwise Creator, and exert them for the purpose\r\nof increasing the prosperity, or at any rate in endeavouring to diminish\r\nthe sum of sufferings of his creatures, whether they be our fellow-men or\r\nthe divers races that are submitted to our capricious power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFECTIONS OF THE SIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different terms applied to the various morbid affections of vision\r\nhave been frequently misconceived, and consequently have occasioned much\r\nconfusion in their application. Those vitiated conditions which are\r\nusually noticed may be classed as follows:\r\n\r\n    I. Night sight.\r\n   II. Day sight.\r\n  III. Long sight.\r\n   IV. Short sight.\r\n    V. Skew sight.\r\n   VI. False sight.\r\n\r\n_Night sight_, specifically called _Lucifuga_, was also termed\r\n_Nyctalopia_, from [Greek: nyx], _night_, and [Greek: ops], _eye_; it was\r\nalso known as the _Noctem amans_. This affection was thus named in\r\nconsequence of the person labouring under it being only able to see at\r\nnight, or in a deep shade; hence the first name: while nyctalopia has been\r\nused by most modern writers in the opposite sense of _night-sight ache_,\r\nagreeably, according to Mason Good's observations, to the technical or\r\nimplied meaning of _opia_, in which case it always applies to a diseased\r\nvision; whence nyctalopia has been made to import day sight, instead of\r\nnight sight.\r\n\r\nThis disease appears to be dependent upon a peculiar irritability of the\r\nretina, produced by two different causes,--a sudden exposure to a stronger\r\nlight than the eye has been accustomed to bear, or a deficiency of the\r\nblack pigment which lines the choroid tunic. If the iris be weak and\r\ntorpid, it is enlarged; if strong and contracted, diminished. Thus, those\r\nwho from peculiar circumstances reside in dark caverns and subterraneous\r\nabodes, or who have long been confined in obscure dungeons, labour under\r\nthe first of these causes; instances of which were observed in two of the\r\ncaptives liberated from the Bastille in 1789.\r\n\r\nRamazzini informs us that this affection is commonly observed among the\r\nItalian peasants, amongst whom he was not able to trace any other\r\npeculiarity than an enlargement of the pupil. This state of the vision,\r\nhowever, has been attributed to the peculiar brightness of the Italian\r\nsky, its clear atmosphere, and the relaxing warmth of the temperature.\r\nThe Italian peasants are therefore constantly exposed to all those causes\r\nthat tend to debilitate the iris, while they irritate the retina. We thus\r\nfind these causes acting with renewed power at the season when the disease\r\nusually makes its attack,--the vernal equinox, when an increased flood of\r\nsolar rays breaks on them. Such is the dimness that this brightness\r\nproduces, that the peasantry frequently lose their way in the fields in\r\nthe glare of day; but on the approach of night they can see distinctly.\r\nHence are they obliged to remain for some weeks in the shade to recover\r\ntheir sight.\r\n\r\nA deficiency of the black pigment of the eye is occasionally found in\r\npersons of a very fair complexion and light hair. This affection is\r\ntherefore common in the Albinoes. This circumstance arises from the\r\nwhiteness of the eyelashes and hair, whereby the retina is deprived of the\r\nnatural shade that softens the light in its descent. This debilitated race\r\ngenerally inhabit warm and damp regions; they are seldom long-lived, and\r\nfrequently low-spirited and morose. The iris is of a pink colour, and this\r\ncircumstance, added to the constant winking that the weakness of the organ\r\noccasions, gives them a distressing appearance. In horses, this want of\r\nthe dark pigment constitutes what is called the _wall eye_.\r\n\r\nAcuteness in night vision is natural to most, if not to all, animals that\r\nprowl in the dark. In the feline genus we observe that the iris can be\r\ncontracted much closer than in mankind, when exposed to a vivid glare; but\r\nthey also expand to a much greater degree when obscurity sets in. Owls,\r\nbats, and many insects, possess a similar faculty.\r\n\r\n_Day sight_, the nyctalopia of some authors, is said to be endemic in some\r\ncountries,--Poland, the West Indies, Brazil, and various intertropical\r\nregions. This affection arises from causes totally different from the\r\nformer one. Here the eye is habitually exposed to too great a flood of\r\nlight, whence the retina becomes torpid. It has been said to be endemic in\r\nsome districts of France, particularly in the neighbourhood of Roche\r\nGuyon, on the banks of the Seine; but here the soil is of a dazzling\r\nwhite: and as it makes its attacks in the spring, and continues for three\r\nmonths, it is supposed to arise from the keenness of the reflected light,\r\nafter the dreary winter months.\r\n\r\nThis disease has also been commonly observed in Russia, especially in the\r\nsummer, when the eye is exposed, with scarcely any intermission, to the\r\nconstant action of light, as the sun dips but little below the horizon,\r\nand there is scarcely any interval of darkness. Hens are subject to this\r\naffection, and cannot see to pick up their food in the dusk of the\r\nevening. The complaint is, from this circumstance, called _hen blindness_.\r\n\r\nDr. Heberden has communicated the following curious case of this species\r\nof affection: \"A man about forty years old had in the spring a tertian\r\nfever, for which he took too small a quantity of bark, so that the returns\r\nof it were weakened without being removed. Three days after his last fit,\r\nbeing then employed on board a ship in the river, he observed at\r\nsun-setting that all objects began to look blue, which blueness gradually\r\nthickened into a cloud; and not long after he became so blind as hardly to\r\nperceive the light of a candle. The next morning about sunrising his sight\r\nwas restored as perfectly as ever. When the next night came on, he lost\r\nhis sight again in the same manner, and this continued for twelve days and\r\nnights. He then came ashore, where the disorder of his eyes gradually\r\nabated, and in three days was entirely gone. A month after he went on\r\nboard another ship, and after three days' stay in it the night blindness\r\nreturned as before, and lasted all the time of his remaining in the ship,\r\nwhich was nine nights. He then left the ship, and his blindness did not\r\nreturn while he was upon land. Some little time afterwards he went into\r\nanother ship, in which he continued for ten days, during which time the\r\nblindness returned only two nights, and never afterwards.\" It appears,\r\nhowever, that this individual had previously laboured under an affection\r\nproduced by the use of lead, which had left him in a state of much nervous\r\ndebility. Notwithstanding this circumstance, this case clearly proves that\r\nthe affection is liable to be increased and brought on by local influence.\r\n\r\n_Long sight._ In this species of vision the iris is habitually dilated,\r\nand not easily stimulated into contraction. Several varieties of this\r\naffection have been observed. Dr. Wells, in the Philosophical\r\nTransactions, relates the case of a young person who, from a permanent\r\ndilatation of the pupil, saw near objects with much difficulty and\r\nconfusion, but remote bodies with singular accuracy. The power of moving\r\nthe upper lid was completely lost. This dilatation of the pupil, which may\r\nbe artificially produced by the application of belladonna, can be remedied\r\nby the use of convex glasses.\r\n\r\n_Short sight._ In this case the iris is contracted, and the cornea, which\r\nin long sight is too much flattened, is too convex or polarised; therefore\r\nspectacles of an opposite character, and with concave glasses, become\r\nnecessary. Mice are said to be short-sighted; hence the affection has been\r\ntermed myopia or myopiasis, literally \"mouse-sight.\"\r\n\r\n_Skew sight_, or _sight askew_, is a condition of our vision only accurate\r\nwhen the object is placed obliquely, in consequence of some partial\r\nobfuscation of the cornea, frequently from slight scars, scarcely, if at\r\nall, observable. In this lateral vision the axis of the eye affected\r\nusually coincides with that of the sound eye. In squinting, on the\r\ncontrary, the two axes do not coincide.\r\n\r\nIn _false sight_, imaginary objects float before the sight; or, at other\r\ntimes, objects assume imaginary forms and qualities. The latter species\r\nhas been divided in cases where the objects that are supposed to be seen\r\nhave no real existence, and in cases where actual objects have assumed\r\nqualities that do not appertain to them. The first are termed ocular\r\nphantasms or spectres; the latter, ocular transmutations or illusions.\r\nThese spectres sometimes form dark spots, called by physicians _muscae\r\nvolitantes_. In another species, a net-work seems to be spread before the\r\neyes; hence called _visus reticularis_. In a third form sparks\r\nscintillate, and this appearance is experienced when the eye has been\r\nstruck. The eye is also troubled with an imaginary sense of dazzling,\r\nconstituting the _myrmaryge_ of the Greek writers; at other times, an\r\niridescent appearance, exhibiting the colours of the rainbow, is\r\nexperienced, although sometimes this impression is confined to a single\r\ncolour. Dr. Heberden relates the case of a lady of advanced age, lodging\r\non the eastern coast of Kent, in a house that looked immediately upon the\r\nsea, and exposed to the glare of the morning sun. The curtains of her room\r\nwere white, a circumstance which added to the intensity of the light. When\r\nshe had been there about ten days, she observed one evening, at the time\r\nof sunset, that first the fringes of the clouds appeared red, and soon\r\nafter the same colour was diffused over all the objects around her,\r\nespecially if they were white. This lasted the whole night, but in the\r\nmorning her sight was again perfect. This alternation of morbid and sound\r\nsight prevailed the whole time the lady resided on the coast, which was\r\nthree weeks; and for nearly as long after she left it, at which time it\r\nceased suddenly of its own accord.\r\n\r\nThere exists another variety of false sight, that Plenk has denominated\r\n_metamorphopsia_, and in which objects appear changed in their natural\r\nqualities, producing error of form, error of motion, error of number, and\r\nerror of colour. I had a patient in Lisbon who fancied that all the horses\r\nhe saw carried horns or extensive antlers. A young lady whom I attended\r\nbeheld every one of a gigantic height. Dr. Priestley has given a curious\r\ncase of error of colour in five brothers and two sisters, all adults. One\r\nof the brothers could form no idea whatever of colours, though he judged\r\nvery accurately of the form and other qualities of objects; hence he\r\nthought stockings were sufficiently distinguished by the name of\r\nstockings, and could not conceive the necessity of calling them white or\r\nblack. He could perceive cherries on a tree; but only distinguished them,\r\neven when red-ripe, from the surrounding leaves by their size and shape.\r\nOne of the brothers appeared to have a faint sense of a few colours, but\r\nstill a very imperfect notion; and, upon the whole, they did not seem to\r\npossess any other distinguishing power than that of light and shade, into\r\nwhich they resolved all the colours presented to them,--so that dove or\r\nstraw colour were regarded as white; and green, crimson, and purple, as\r\nblack or dark. On looking at a rainbow, one of them could distinguish that\r\nit consisted of stripes, but nothing more. Dr. Nicholl relates the case of\r\na boy who confounded green with red; and called light red and pink, blue.\r\nHis maternal grandfather and one uncle had the same imperfection. The\r\nlatter was in the navy, and having a blue coat and waistcoat, purchased a\r\npair of red breeches to match. The same physician knew a gentleman who\r\ncould not distinguish green from red; a cucumber and a boiled lobster did\r\nnot offer the least difference in colour. His brother and his niece\r\nlaboured under a similar affection.\r\n\r\nSome philosophers are of opinion, that in the power of conceiving colours\r\nthere is a striking difference in individuals, and are inclined to think\r\nthat in many instances the supposed defects of sight ought to be ascribed\r\nto a defect in the power of conception, arising probably from some early\r\nhabit of inattention. This theory is scarcely tenable. The utmost\r\ninattention and indifference regarding surrounding objects could never\r\nlead to a delusive view of any colour; also, it is more than probable\r\nthat, in the case of a child in whom such a defective vision was observed,\r\nhis attention would be incessantly called on by those around him, to\r\ncorrect, if possible, so strange a delusion. Moreover, this defect of\r\nvision, as we have seen, appears in some instances to be hereditary; and\r\nto prevail in families.\r\n\r\nPhrenologists of course are of opinion that the judgment of colours\r\nresides in a particular organ, remarkably full and prominent in painters\r\ndistinguished by the perfection of their colouring. According to Gall, a\r\nlocal deficiency of brain is observable where the power of distinguishing\r\ncolours is wanting.\r\n\r\nThe sense of vision exhibits more variety in the different classes of\r\nanimals than any of the others. In man, and the greater number of\r\nquadrupeds, this organ is guarded by an upper and a lower lid, both of\r\nwhich in man are fringed with lashes. This is not the case in most\r\nquadrupeds. In the elephant, opossum, seal, cats, other mammalia, birds,\r\nand all fishes, we find a third eyelid, or nictitating membrane, as it is\r\ncalled, arising from the internal angle of the eye, capable of covering\r\nand protecting the eye from danger, either wholly or in part. In the dog\r\nthis membrane is narrow; in oxen and horses it extends half over the\r\neyeball. It is by means of this veil that eagles are capable of fixing\r\ntheir eyes on the noon-day sun. The largest eyes in proportion to the size\r\nof the animal are found in birds,--nearly the smallest in whales; but the\r\nmost diminutive are those of the shrew and mole, the latter's not\r\nexceeding the size of a pin's head.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the organs of vision differs materially. In man and\r\nmonkeys they are placed directly under the forehead; in some fishes, such\r\nas the turbot and flounder tribes, both eyes are placed in the same side\r\nof the head. In the snail they are situated on the horns; and in the\r\nspider, distributed over various points of the body, and in different\r\narrangements.\r\n\r\nEyes, however, are not indispensable to become sensible of the presence of\r\nlight. Several zoophytes, that do not possess the organs of vision, are\r\nperfectly alive to its influence. A distinct organ is not always\r\nindispensable for a distinct sense. It is probable that in those animals\r\nthat appear to be endowed with particular senses, without displaying\r\nparticular organs relating to them, the senses are diffused like that of\r\ntouch, over the whole surface. This subject has been admirably commented\r\non by Cuvier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHELLEBORE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial this substance has been considered an efficacious\r\nremedy in mania. The Greeks pretended that the daughters of Proetus,\r\nsmitten with insanity by Bacchus, were restored to reason by the shepherd\r\nMelampus, who gave them some milk drawn from goats that had eaten\r\nhellebore. It is supposed that the use of purgatives arose from this\r\nfabulous tradition, whence this plant was called _melampodium_.\r\n\r\nThe ancients described two varieties, the white and the black. The first,\r\naccording to Theophrastus, was found on a part of Mount Oeta called\r\nPyra, on which the body of Hercules was burnt. It is not certain whether\r\nthey confounded our hellebore with our veratrum. Pinel supposes that the\r\nveratrum album was their hellebore, as it is not probable that the\r\nveratrum nigrum should have been thus confounded. Tournefort, in his\r\ntravels in the Levant, fancied that he had discovered the root of the\r\nancients in one that the Turks called _zopteme_, which answered in its\r\ncharacter to the description recorded in older writers.\r\n\r\nHowbeit, it was considered a powerful purgative and emetic, especially\r\nindicated in the treatment of mental affections. Celsus forbade its\r\nexhibition in summer and during the winter, or whenever febrile symptoms\r\nwere prevalent. This precaution, however, applied to all purgative\r\nmedicines; and to this day, in several parts of the continent, similar\r\ninjunctions are usual; and even in France practitioners of the old school\r\nprepare a patient several days before any opening medicine is given,--a\r\nlearned precaution, that has but too frequently rendered every medicine\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of this drug was a matter of so much importance amongst the\r\nancients, that it was specifically termed _helleborism_; and it was\r\nconsidered of so powerful a nature in mania, that the treatment of the\r\nmalady was called _navigare Anticyras_, since it was near the town of\r\nAnticyras that the plant was generally gathered. If this process of\r\nhelleborism proved efficacious, it is more than probable that its\r\nbeneficial results proceeded from the violent evacuations that preceded\r\nit. The following was the mode adopted with the helleborised: The patient\r\nwas first well fed for several days until the decline of the moon, when a\r\npowerful emetic was given to him; five days after a similar dose was\r\nprescribed, and then good living ordered for a month: at the expiration of\r\nthis invigorating respite, emetics began again to work him every three\r\ndays. After the last attack on his digestive head-quarters, he was bathed,\r\nfed again, and hellebore was given after he had been submitted to several\r\nhours' friction with olive oil. The emetics were invariably administered\r\non a full stomach, which was cleared either by medicine or the excitement\r\nof the beard of a quill poked down the unfortunate patient's throat. At\r\nother times, (by way, no doubt, of variety,) rejection was excited by\r\nmaking the patient eat a pound or more of horseradish; after which he was\r\nwalked about for some time; and then, after a short repose, the fingers or\r\nthe quill were brought into action. After this operation he was lulled to\r\nsleep by a regular shampooing. It appears that, despite of all these\r\npractices, the stomachs of the ancients were sometimes so pertinaciously\r\nretentive, that more powerful means to _relieve_ them were adopted; and\r\nwhen the longest feather that could be plucked from a goose proved\r\nunavailing, gloves dipped in the oil of cyprus were put on, and the\r\nfingers thus inuncted replaced the feathers. When this failed, the\r\nobstinate sufferer was made to swallow a quart or two of honey and hot\r\nwater, in which rue had been infused; and when this proved ineffectual, he\r\nwas slung in a hammock to produce the sensation of sea-sickness. In some\r\ncases it appears that, despite this practice, the patient thought proper\r\nto faint. On such occasions little wedges of wood were driven between his\r\nobstinate and rebellious teeth clenched against medicine, so as to allow\r\nthe introduction of the goose-quill, while cephalic snuff of the precious\r\nhellebore and euphorbia was blown up his nostrils to produce sneezing. The\r\nlast trial to relieve him was tossing the ill-fated wight in a blanket.\r\nAfter this experiment the patient was left to nature or to his friends, if\r\nhe _would_ not recover. These friends immediately proceeded to give him\r\npunches in the stomach, roll him about the floor, and endeavour to restore\r\nhim to his senses by driving him out of them by every possible noise that\r\ncould frighten him, if his _frightful_ condition was at all susceptible of\r\nany thing left in the arsenal of medicinal ingenuity.[45]\r\n\r\nSmall doses of hellebore seem to have been taken not only with impunity,\r\nbut were supposed to assist the mental faculties. According to Valerius\r\nMaximus and Aulus Gellius, orators were in the practice of using this\r\nstimulus before their disputations. Such, it is said, was the habit of\r\nCarneades, whose doctrines might well have been applied to this very day\r\nto many theories, since he denied that any thing in the world could be\r\nperceived or understood.\r\n\r\nHellebore is to this day an ingredient in many of the fashionable pills\r\nvended by successful quacks. This introduction, at any rate, shows that\r\ntheir compounders have candour enough to think (although they may not\r\nacknowledge it) that the intellectual faculties of the purchasers of their\r\nnostrums do stand in need of some medicinal aid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSYMPATHIES AND ANTIPATHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe constant effects produced by causes which do not appear connected with\r\nthem, are phenomena both of organic and inorganic nature which have long\r\nfixed the attention of philosophers, and have not yet been satisfactorily\r\nexplained. This operation between distant bodies cannot be traced to any\r\nmedium of communication. It arises from an attractive and a repulsive\r\npower that cannot be defined. Almost every substance evinces inclinations\r\nor antipathies; is attracted with more or less strength by one body,\r\nindifferent towards a second, and constantly avoiding a third; nay, bodies\r\nappear to act where they are not present, and where no communication can\r\nexist. We are as ignorant of the nature of these phenomena as of those of\r\ngravitation, magnetism, and electricity. Still, although this medium of\r\ncommunication is not evident, it must be admitted by inference that there\r\nmust exist a connecting channel, although its nature be unknown.\r\n\r\nThe ancients called sympathy _consensus_, and the moderns have also\r\ndefined it a _consent of parts_; nor is this definition incorrect, since\r\nsympathy arises from the relative ties that mysteriously unite our several\r\norgans, however distant and unconnected they may appear; thus establishing\r\na beauteous harmony between all the functions of the animal economy.\r\nSympathies must therefore constitute the chief study of the physiologist:\r\non this alone can the physician ground his investigation of the various\r\ndisorders to which flesh is heir. Symptoms arise from sympathies: without\r\na knowledge of the one we can never attain a clear insight in the other.\r\n\r\nSympathies are of a physical or a moral nature. The first consist, as I\r\nhave already stated, of a consent between the different parts of the\r\norganism; the latter of certain impressions, unaccountable, unconquerable,\r\nthat harmonize in a multiplicity of phenomena various individuals, or that\r\ninduce them, without their being able to assign any reason or motive to\r\nwarrant the repugnance, to avoid each other, and not unfrequently to\r\nentertain a feeling of disgust or horror. A secret voice has\r\nspoken,--organism instinctively obeys. Moral sympathies have been defined\r\nas faculties that enabled us to partake of the ideas, the affections, or\r\nthe dislike of others; although this sentiment is by no means reciprocal,\r\nand we often dislike those who fondly love us. So far sympathy is\r\ninstinctive; yet, like many instincts, it is more or less under the\r\ncontrol of our reason. We often acquire an artificial partiality to\r\nsubstances that we naturally disliked. Our senses may be considered the\r\ninstruments of our sympathies; yet senses are regulated by education and\r\nhabit. Oil, olives, tobacco, and various other substances, are naturally,\r\none might say instinctively, unpleasant to most individuals; yet by custom\r\nthey are not only relished, but ardently wished for when they cannot be\r\nobtained. It is the same with our relative partiality or aversion towards\r\nindividuals; and indifference is often turned into affection, while the\r\nmost ardent love is not far remote from hate, when vanity more especially,\r\nremoves its boundaries.\r\n\r\nIf we admit that our sympathies are lodged in certain specific organs, we\r\nmust consider that we are the slaves of organism; whereas it is pretty\r\npositive that to a certain extent we are the slaves of habit. Even the\r\nmost ardent and prevailing passions, the indulgence in which has become an\r\nabsolute necessity, cease to be brought into action when they have long\r\nremained dormant. To associate our moral sympathies with physical consents\r\nof parts is to level man with the brute creation; although we hourly see\r\nthe most decided instinctive dislikes in animals overcome by education. A\r\nmouse may be brought up with a cat, and a hawk with a sparrow; although a\r\nchicken has been known to dart at a fly the moment its head was out of the\r\negg.\r\n\r\nNor can we view in the same light the affinities of inorganic bodies. They\r\nare subject to chemical laws; each is endowed with specific qualities\r\nthat seldom or never vary, and some other body must be interposed to check\r\ntheir attraction; and that body, in the relation of inorganic matter, may\r\nbe compared to the influence of the mind in intellectual beings. In\r\nanimals, the very laws of nature are not unfrequently unheeded; and in\r\nthese instances natural instincts appear less powerful than the mechanical\r\ndiscrimination that we witness in vegetable life, where germs, and\r\nmolecules, and fibrils not only select each other, according to nature's\r\nharmonic institutions, but actually attract each other from distant\r\nsituations. This attractive power is beautifully illustrated in the\r\nmysterious vegetation of the _vallisneria spiralis_, an aquatic plant, in\r\nwhich the male and female are distinct individuals. The organization of\r\nthe male qualifies it to adapt itself to the surface of the water, from\r\nthe bottom of which the plant shoots forth, and to float in the middle of\r\nthe deep and rapid tide. The female, on the contrary, is only found in\r\nshallow waters, or on shores where the tide exerts but little influence.\r\nThus differently formed and situated, how does their union take place? It\r\nis a wonderful mystery. As soon as the male flower is perfect, the spinal\r\nstem dries away, and the flower thus separated sails away towards the\r\nshore in pursuit of the female, for the most part driven by a current of\r\nwind or the stream; yet as soon as it arrives near its destination it\r\nobeys a new influence, and is attracted towards the object of its pursuit,\r\ndespite the powers of that wind and tide which until then directed it. No\r\nhypothesis, however ingenious, can explain this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the doctrines of various writers, I am of opinion that our\r\npassions are clearly instinctive, but fortunately more or less under the\r\ncontrol of our mental faculties in well-regulated individuals, who do not\r\nyield to these instinctive feelings an unbridled course; and I doubt much\r\nif there does exist a single passion, however inordinate it may appear,\r\nthat cannot be mastered. Both good and evil qualities are frequently\r\nartificial, and arise from peculiar moral and physical conditions.\r\nSelf-preservation is an instinctive feeling; yet man will wantonly risk\r\nhis existence from false views regarding his social position. Courage has\r\nbeen considered as differing in its quality (if I may use the term), and\r\narises sometimes from a natural animal or brute propensity, at others from\r\ncalculation and reflection; and the latter most unquestionably may temper\r\nthe former. Duclos' distinction between what is called the courageous\r\nheart and the courageous mind, is by no means as objectionable as some of\r\nhis opponents maintain. If courage is an instinctive faculty, residing in\r\na certain organ, how comes it that this organism varies at different\r\nperiods? How comes it, moreover, that this variety depends upon\r\ncircumstances? I have seen a desperate duellist disgrace himself by a\r\ncowardly flight in the field of battle. I have known an arrant poltroon\r\ndefend himself desperately against robbers; and a man, considered of\r\nundoubted courage, surrender his arms to a single footpad. In our\r\ninstincts, our sympathies, we are to a certain extent the children of\r\ncircumstances; and it would be as absurd to maintain that we cannot\r\ncontrol our moral sympathies, as to excuse the commission of murder or of\r\ntheft.\r\n\r\nOur physical sympathies are of a nature totally different. Here they are\r\nbrought into action according to certain laws of the organization, as\r\nuncontrollable as chemical affinities; and I doubt much whether our\r\nunaccountable antipathies may not be considered as appertaining to this\r\ncategory: they seem to depend upon certain laws of attraction and\r\nrepulsion. The channel of this communication, as I have already observed,\r\nwill perhaps remain for ever in utter obscurity. To this day we know not\r\nin what manner certain articles of food and medical substances find a path\r\nto the kidneys with such a rapidity as to render it improbable that it was\r\nthrough the medium of the circulation. The nature of other physiological\r\nphenomena is equally unexplained. Through what channel of communication\r\ndoes the cat-hater know that one of these animals is in the room, although\r\nunseen by him? Yet these antipathies might be conquered. A man was wont to\r\nfall into fits at the sight of a spider; a waxen one was made, which\r\nequally terrified him. When he had recovered his faculties, his error was\r\npointed out, the wax figure was put into his hand without inspiring dread,\r\nand shortly the living insect no longer disturbed him.\r\n\r\nCertain antipathies appear to depend upon a peculiarity of the senses. The\r\nhorror inspired by the odour of certain flowers may be referred to this\r\ncause. Amatus Lusitanus relates the case of a monk who fainted when he\r\nbeheld a rose, and never quitted his cell when that flower was blooming.\r\nScaliger mentions one of his relations who experienced a similar horror\r\nwhen seeing a lily. In these instances it is not the agreeableness or the\r\noffensive nature of the aroma that inspires the repugnance; and Montaigne\r\nremarked on this subject, that there were men who dreaded an apple more\r\nthan a musket-ball. Zimmerman tells us of a lady who could not endure the\r\nfeeling of silk and satin, and shuddered when touching the velvety skin of\r\na peach. Boyle records the case of a man who felt a natural abhorrence to\r\nhoney. Without his knowledge, some honey was introduced in a plaster\r\napplied to his foot, and the accidents that resulted compelled his\r\nattendants to withdraw it. A young man was known to faint whenever he\r\nheard the servant sweeping. Hippocrates mentions one Nicanor who swooned\r\nwhenever he heard a flute: our Shakspeare has alluded to the effects of\r\nthe bagpipe. Julia, daughter of Frederick, king of Naples, could not taste\r\nmeat without serious accidents. Boyle fainted when he heard the splashing\r\nof water; Scaliger turned pale at the sight of water-cresses; Erasmus\r\nexperienced febrile symptoms when smelling fish; the Duke d'Epernon\r\nswooned on beholding a leveret, although a hare did not produce the same\r\neffect. Tycho Brahe fainted at the sight of a fox, Henry the Third of\r\nFrance at that of a cat, and Marshal d'Albert at a pig. The horror that\r\nwhole families entertain of cheese is generally known. Many individuals\r\ncannot digest, or even retain certain substances, such as rice, wine,\r\nvarious fruits, and vegetables.\r\n\r\nThere are also antipathies that border upon mental aberration. Such was\r\nthe case with a clergyman who fainted whenever a certain verse in Jeremiah\r\nwas read. I lately dined in company with a gentleman who was seized with\r\nsymptoms of syncope whenever a surgical operation or an accident was\r\nspoken of. St. John Long's name happened to be mentioned, and he was\r\ncarried out of the room. I have also known a person who experienced an\r\nalarming vertigo and dizziness whenever a great height or a dizzy\r\nprecipice was described. A similar accident has been occasioned by Edgar's\r\ndescription of Dover Cliff in King Lear. All these sympathies may be\r\nlooked upon as morbid affections, or rather peculiar idiosyncrasies,\r\nbeyond the control of our reason or our volition, although it is not\r\nimpossible that they might be gradually checked by habit. Our dislikes to\r\nindividuals are often as unaccountable, when we are obliged to confess\r\nwith the poet Martial:\r\n\r\n  Non amo te, Sabidi, nec possum dicere quare;\r\n  Hoc tantum possum dicere, Non amo te.\r\n\r\nIt is the same with our affections. The ancients, amongst others\r\nEmpedocles, fancied that attraction and repulsion constituted the\r\nprincipal actions of life, and harmonized the universe. Hesiod dispels\r\nChaos through the agency of Love. Aversions were attributed to the\r\ninfluence of an evil eye. To avoid its direful effects, strange practices\r\nwere adopted, according to Tibullus; and to check the malefices of wicked\r\ncrones, it was customary to spit three times in an infant's bosom,\r\n\r\n  Despuit in molles et sibi quisque sinus;\r\n\r\nwhile the well-known amulet representing the god Fascinus, was suspended\r\nround the child's neck. Maidens were veiled to guard them against this\r\nnoxious power, and secrecy and retirement were deemed the most effectual\r\nmeans of security.\r\n\r\n  Latendum est dum vivimus, ut feliciter vivamus.\r\n\r\nIn a preceding article I have given a sketch of the custom of\r\nadministering love-philters.\r\n\r\nThe singular sympathies that forewarn a future union between the sexes\r\nhave in some instances been most surprising. The following example, that\r\ncame within my knowledge, is perhaps one of the most singular: Mr. ----, a\r\nbrother officer of mine, was a man of taciturn and retired habits, seldom\r\nfrequenting public places of amusement, and, when there, felt any thing\r\nbut gratification. One evening after dinner he was, however, prevailed\r\nupon to go to a ball. We had not been long in the room when, to my utter\r\nsurprise, he expressed great admiration of a young lady who was dancing,\r\nand, what still more amazed us all, he engaged her to dance. Such an act\r\nof apparent levity on his part struck us as a singularity which might have\r\nbeen attributed to an unusual indulgence at table, had not the contrary\r\nbeen the case, for he was remarkably abstemious. The dance was scarcely\r\nover when he came to me, and told me with a look of deep despondency, that\r\nhis lovely partner was a married woman. The tone of sadness in which he\r\naddressed me was truly ludicrous. A few minutes after he left the\r\nball-room. The strangeness of his conduct led me to fear that his mind was\r\nnot altogether in a sound state; but I was confirmed in my apprehension\r\nwhen he told me the following morning that he was convinced he should be\r\nmarried to the object of his admiration, whose husband was a young and\r\nhealthy clergyman in the neighbourhood. Here matters rested, and we both\r\nwent abroad. We did not meet until three years after, when, to my utter\r\nsurprise, I found that his prediction had been verified. The lady's\r\nhusband had died from a fall from his horse, and the parties were married.\r\nBut what rendered this circumstance still more strange is, that a similar\r\npresentiment was experienced by the young lady herself who, on returning\r\nfrom the ball, mentioned to her sister with much emotion, that she had\r\ndanced with a stranger, to whom she felt convinced that she was destined\r\nto be married. This conviction embittered every moment of her life, as,\r\ndespite her most strenuous endeavours, she could not dismiss her partner\r\nfrom her constant thoughts, reluctantly yielding to the hope of seeing him\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe sympathetic power of fascination is another unaccountable phenomenon.\r\nIt is well known that in regions infested with venomous snakes, there are\r\npersons endowed both by nature and by art with the power of disarming the\r\nreptiles of their poisonous capacities. The ancient Cyrenaica was overrun\r\nwith poisonous serpents, and the Psylli were a tribe gifted with this\r\nfaculty. When Cato pursued Juba over the Cyrenaica desert, he took some of\r\nthese Psylli with him to cure the poisoned wounds that these reptiles\r\nmight have inflicted on his soldiers. Bruce informs us that all the blacks\r\nin the kingdom of Sennaar are perfectly armed by nature against the bite\r\nof either scorpion or viper. They take the cerastes, or horned serpent,\r\n(one of the most venomous of all the viper tribe,) in their hands at all\r\ntimes, put them in their bosoms, and throw them to one another, as\r\nchildren do apples or balls; during which sport the serpents are seldom\r\nirritated to bite, and, when they do bite, no mischief ensues from the\r\nwound. It is said that this power is derived from the practice of chewing\r\ncertain plants in their infancy. This is most probably the fact; these\r\nsubstances may impregnate the body with some quality obnoxious to the\r\nreptile. The same traveller has given an account of several of these\r\nroots. In South America a similar practice prevails, and a curious memoir\r\non the subject was drawn out by Don Pedro d'Orbies y Vargas, detailing\r\nvarious experiments. He informs us that the plant thus employed is the\r\n_vejuco de guaco_, hence denominated from its having been observed that\r\nthe bird of that name also called the serpent-hawk, usually sucked the\r\njuice of this plant before his attacks upon poisonous serpents. Prepared\r\nby drinking a small portion of this juice, inoculating themselves with it\r\nby rubbing it upon punctures in the skin, Don Pedro himself, and all his\r\ndomestics, were accustomed to venture into the fields, and fearlessly\r\nseize the most venomous of these serpents. Acrell, in the _Amoenitates\r\nAcademicae_, informs us that the _senega_ possesses a similar power. The\r\ntantalus or ibis of Egypt, that derives its chief food from venomous\r\nanimals, depends in a like manner on the protection of antidotes. This\r\npower of fascinating serpents is so great, that they remain totally torpid\r\nand inactive under its influence, and are not even able to offer any\r\nresistance when skinned from tail to head like an eel, and eaten alive.\r\nAccording to Bruce, they sicken the moment they are laid hold of, and are\r\nexhausted by this invincible power as though they had been struck by\r\nlightning or an electric battery, shutting their eyes the moment they are\r\nseized, and never attempting to turn their mouth towards the person that\r\nholds them. It has been asserted that the Hindoo jugglers render serpents\r\ninnocuous by the extraction of their teeth, and although this may be the\r\npractice in some parts of India, it is not generally resorted to in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nDr. Mead and Smith Barton of Philadelphia endeavour to explain this power\r\nby the influence of terror. This supposition, however, is not correct,\r\nsince the serpent will injure one man and not another, if the latter is\r\ngifted with this faculty and the former one is not. Major Gordon of South\r\nCarolina attributes the fascinating power of reptiles to a vapour which\r\nthey exhale and shed around them; and he mentions a negro who, from a\r\npeculiar acuteness of smell, could discover a rattlesnake at two hundred\r\nfeet distance. That certain odours are overpowering there is not the least\r\ndoubt; and trout and other fresh-water fishes are charmed and caught\r\nwithout resistance when the hand is smeared with asafoetida, marjoram,\r\nand other aromas. The fishes, delighted no doubt with this odour, or\r\nintoxicated by its power, will actually flock towards the fingers, and\r\nallow themselves to be laid hold of.\r\n\r\nThieves and housebreakers have been known to possess the power of quieting\r\nwatch-dogs, and keeping them silent during their depredations. Lindecrantz\r\ninforms us that the Laplanders can instantly disarm the most furious dog,\r\nand oblige it to fly from them with every expression of terror. The\r\nstrange faculty of taming the most unmanageable horses, possessed by an\r\nIrishman, hence called the _Whisperer_, is well known. Several\r\nhorse-breakers have appeared at various periods possessing the same art,\r\nand they would make the wildest horse follow them as tamely as a dog, and\r\nlie down at their bidding. It has been affirmed that these whisperers\r\nintroduce a globule of quicksilver, or some other substance, into the\r\nanimal's ears. It is, however, more probable that these charmers derive\r\ntheir power of fascination from some natural or artificial emanation. The\r\nmost singular power of fascination is perhaps that exhibited by the\r\njugglers of Egypt, who, by merely pressing the serpent called _haje_ on\r\nthe neck, stiffen the reptile to such a degree, that they can wave it like\r\na wand.\r\n\r\nTo explain this sympathetic influence that living beings exercise on each\r\nother, as I have already observed, has long been the study of\r\nphilosophers. Their chief theories may be divided into those of the\r\nadvocates of _pneumatism_ or _spiritualism_, who maintained that the\r\nnerves transmitted a subtle fluid susceptible of external transmission.\r\nSuch were the disciples of Plato; and, amongst the moderns, the Arabian\r\nwriters, Paracelsus, Van Helmont, Willis, Digby, Wirdig, and even\r\nBoerhave. The _mechanicians_ formed another class, refusing to admit the\r\ndoctrine of influences, and submitting all sympathetic phenomena to the\r\nlaws of mechanism and chemistry. Amongst these we find the Cartesians,\r\nBoyle, Hoffmann, and Haller. Their doctrine had already been established\r\namongst the ancients by Asclepiades. The third system was that of the\r\n_organicians_, who attributed these effects to our organization, governed\r\nby a principle of free agency. In this school are recorded the names of\r\nHippocrates, Galen, Stahl, Bordeu, and many illustrious writers of various\r\nages. An investigation of these discrepancies would be foreign to these\r\nsketches. I can only observe, that none of them are tenable, and have only\r\ntended to display scholastic learning and ingenuity, without any practical\r\nbeneficial results. Indeed, the only advantages that might possibly accrue\r\nfrom these pursuits would be the shedding of some faint light upon our\r\nsystems of early education, by finding out the most judicious method of\r\ncounteracting innate dispositions and peculiar idiosyncrasies.\r\n\r\nThe life of man is a relative and external existence. He lives in\r\ncommunion with all around him, and before his ultimate dissolution he is\r\ndoomed to die with every object of his affections that perishes before\r\nhim. To these objects he has been united by the secret powers of sympathy.\r\nThe organism of both appears to have been subject to mutual laws; and\r\ngrief and joy, our pains and pleasures, are transmitted with the rapidity\r\nand power of the magnetic fluid. Nor time nor distance can affect these\r\nsympathies, which have been known to remain latent in our breasts till\r\ncalled into action by accidental circumstances. Thus, a man has never\r\nknown how fondly he loved until he was suddenly deprived of the object of\r\nhis sympathies, although until that moment this affection had been unknown\r\neven to himself. This circumstance clearly proves that these sympathies\r\nare not under the influence of our imagination. Although it is to this\r\ncreative faculty that these reminiscences are attributed by Madame De\r\nStael in the following exquisite words, \"The creative talents of\r\nimagination, for some moments at least, satisfies all our desires and\r\nwishes,--it opens to us heavens of wealth; it offers to us crowns of\r\nglory; it raises before our eyes the pure and bright image of an ideal\r\nworld: and so mighty sometimes is its power, that by it _we hear in our\r\nhearts the very voice and accents of one whom we have loved_.\"\r\n\r\nSympathies might be denominated a moral contagion in mankind: in the brute\r\ncreation they merely produce a physical impulse. Reid attributed to the\r\nnervous system an atmosphere of sensibility, influencing all that came\r\nwithin its range. Ernest Platner maintained that our soul could diffuse\r\nitself in mutual transmission; and in another paper I have shown that life\r\nmay be prolonged by sacrificing the health of others, when the genial\r\nwarmth of youth is surreptitiously communicated to decrepitude.\r\n\r\nWhat is then this invisible vital fluid, this electric principle, that the\r\ntouch, the breath, the warmth, the very aroma of those we are fond of,\r\ncommunicates, when trembling, fluttering, breathless, we approach them?\r\nthat enables us, even when surrounded with darkness, to recognise by the\r\nfeel the hand of her we love? Nay, whence arises the feeling of respect\r\nand veneration that we experience in the presence of the great and the\r\npre-eminently good? It may be said this is the result of our education; we\r\nhave been taught to consider these individuals as belonging to a superior\r\nclass of mortals. To a certain extent this may be true; yet there does\r\nexist an impressive contagion when we are brought into the presence, or\r\nplaced under the guidance, of such truly privileged persons. Their\r\ncourage, their eloquence, their energies, their fanaticism, thrill every\r\nfibre, like the vibration of the chord under the skilful harpist's hand.\r\nActuated by this mystic influence the coward has boldly rushed into the\r\nbattle, the timid dared imminent perils, and the humane been driven to\r\ndeeds of blood. Fanatic contagion has produced both martyrs and heroes.\r\nExample stimulates and emulates, despite our reasoning faculties. _Regis\r\nad exemplar totus componitur orbis._ Imitation is the principle of action,\r\nthe nursery of good and great deeds. We either feel degraded by the\r\nascendancy of others, when we fancy, however vainly, that we may attain\r\ntheir level; or devote ourselves to their cause and their service, when we\r\ntacitly recognize their mastery. It is more particularly in our devotion\r\nand in our love,--two sentiments more analogous than is generally\r\nbelieved,--that this _mutuality_ of sympathies prevails; and when Galigai\r\nwas asked by his judges by what means he had obtained his influence over\r\nMary of Medicis, his reply was similar to that of the Moor when describing\r\nhis course of love,--the witchcraft he had used to win his Desdemona, when\r\nwith a greedy ear devouring his discourse.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that education, circumstances, our state of health,\r\npredisposes us more or less to the action of these sympathetic powers, for\r\nthen our feelings are actually more or less morbid. Affliction, for\r\ninstance, predisposes to tender sentiments. There is perhaps much\r\npsychological matter of fact in the old story of the Ephesian widow; and\r\nour immortal Shakspeare felt the truth not only of the contagion of grief,\r\nbut of its consoling power when reciprocally felt, although no doubt the\r\nreciprocity has often been assumed to woo and win.\r\n\r\n  Grief best is pleased with grief's society.\r\n  True sorrow then is feelingly surprised,\r\n  When with like feeling it is sympathized.\r\n\r\nFortunately for our frail race, sympathies are liable to be worn out by\r\ntheir own exhausting powers. Attrition polishes but indurates at the same\r\ntime: thus does social intercourse harden our gentle predispositions. The\r\nmathematical world dispels the illusions of our fervent youth, as chilling\r\ntruth banishes fancy's flattering dreams. Experience is to man what rust\r\nis to iron; it corrodes, but at the same time protects the metal to a\r\ncertain degree, from the magnet's mighty power.\r\n\r\nAlthough the nature of sympathies most probably will never be ascertained,\r\ntheir study is essential both to the moralist and the physician, and both\r\nmay be materially aided in their vocations by the temperament of the pupil\r\nor the patient; for, as I shall endeavour to show in a subsequent sketch,\r\nour temperaments generally indicate individual characteristics. It is in\r\nvain that some philosophers may deny the power of innate faculties and\r\ndispositions. The very expression '_human nature_' implies their\r\nexistence. To encourage their growth, or to check their developement,\r\nbecomes the duty of those who are entrusted with the education of youth,\r\nwhen yielding to, or counteracting propensities, becomes as necessary as\r\nthe care the horticulturist devotes to his plants. By the inclination that\r\ntrees have taken, we can generally learn the prevalent winds of a\r\ndistrict. The plastic hand of our early teachers may, in most instances,\r\nobtain a similar result; though in the vegetable kingdom, as well as in\r\nthe animal kingdom, there will be constantly found stubborn trunks that\r\nwill resist all influence. Were we to admit that our material organism\r\ncannot be counteracted, we should inevitably fall into many lamentable\r\nerrors, and many a crime would be extenuated on the plea of fatalism. It\r\nis to be feared that some of our ingenious theorists have too frequently\r\ntortured organism on a Procrustean couch, to suit their favourite\r\nphantasies. We might reply to the visions of these enthusiasts in the\r\nwords of Iago, \"Our bodies are our gardens, to which our wills are\r\ngardeners--either to have it sterile with idleness, or manured with\r\nindustry. The power and corrigible authority of this lies in our wills. If\r\nthe balance of our lives had not one scale of reason to poise another of\r\nsensuality, the blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us to the\r\nmost preposterous conclusions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHEUS OF VAN HELMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most ingenious fictions of those speculators who have\r\nendeavoured to explain the mysteries of our wonderful organization, was\r\nperhaps the Archeus of Van Helmont, a term derived from [Greek: arche],\r\n_origin_, _principle_, _authority_, _power_. According to the doctrines of\r\nthis physician, the archeus was an internal agent that commanded and\r\nregulated all the vital functions. I cannot better describe it than by\r\npartly borrowing the language of the founder of the doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe archeus and matter are the natural causes of all. The molecules of\r\nmatter, essentially inert, receive from this principle their movements,\r\ntheir order, their distribution, their conformation: the archeus is the\r\ninternal agent that penetrates them, the nucleus of their inspiration; it\r\nis the mould in which they are elaborated, brought into form by this\r\nplastic influence meeting in this material substance the requisite\r\ndocility to realize its ideas of perfection. Thus the archeus is an active\r\nand an intelligent power, possessing the faculty of amalgamating and\r\nidentifying itself with matter; penetrating its inmost recesses, it\r\nmodifies and changes each particle of matter, producing that\r\nincomprehensible series of oscillations of spontaneousness and\r\nequilibrium, that catenation and marvellous automatism, that constitute\r\nthe consciousness of our existence, and whence springs the only notion we\r\ncan form of its causation. It is the archeus that presides over our sense\r\nof smelling, of tasting, and consequently the selection of our food; it is\r\n_he_ that dissolves it in our digestive organs, liquefies it, and prepares\r\nit for due assimilation; it is he that imparts a conservative action to\r\nthe blood, and converts this vital fluid into bone and muscle. Should any\r\nparticle of our aliments have escaped from this transforming power, these\r\nsubstances become foreign bodies, irritating by their presence this\r\nsovereign power, calling forth his energies and his activity, and exciting\r\nhis indignation and wrath by their repeated provocations. His just fury\r\nstimulates and accelerates the vital functions; but, instead of wreaking\r\nits vengeance on external matter, it overwhelms all internal obstacles,\r\nwhether diffused in the system or concentrated on any given point. It is\r\nthis tumultuous confusion that constitutes maladies, which arise from two\r\nevident causes,--an alteration in matter and a reaction of the archeus.\r\n\r\nOf these two morbid elements, the first is susceptible of a thousand\r\nvarieties both in nature and extent, and therefore produces as many\r\nmodifications in the corrective power. Then does the archeus, threatened\r\non different points in different manners, regulate his plans and\r\noperations both of defence and of attack, selecting his weapons according\r\nto the nature of his antagonists. In this mutual struggle our archeus\r\nwisely checks the impetuosity of his onset, husbands his forces, and\r\nmerely detaches them from the main body according to the circumstances of\r\nthe conflict; thus ever keeping a powerful reserve. It is this wisdom of\r\nconduct that ultimately restores tranquillity, and compels the rebellious\r\nmolecules to submit to the laws of organization. For what constitutes the\r\ncure of a disease, whether obtained by nature or by art? Nothing more than\r\nthe dignified repose of the mighty archeus, when the fire of his wrath has\r\nconsumed his foes. Diseases, therefore, are simply the execution of vast\r\nand complex projects that inspire the archeus, and which he carries into\r\nexecution as the statuary embodies on the marble the conceptions of his\r\ngenius. When the morbid idea is in conformity with his plans, a favourable\r\nresult will ensue; if, on the contrary, the archeus labours under a\r\nmisconception, if he is thrown by erroneous impressions into disordinate\r\nsteps, then may this power, excited without a just motive, or a\r\ndeterminate and proper object, turn its arms against itself, and destroy\r\nthe ties that united it to matter. It is then that art, whose aim it is to\r\nmeet the foe with his own weapons, must have recourse to medicine for the\r\npurpose of rousing the torpor of the archeus, reanimate his energies if he\r\ndroops, overthrow him if he becomes unruly, and finally compel him to\r\nyield, by a salutary terror; forcibly bringing him back to that judicious\r\nequilibrium in action, when all the functions contribute in harmony and\r\nconcert to the general welfare of the system.\r\n\r\nSuch were the truly poetical ideas of Van Helmont, who might have written\r\nan epic on the government, revolutions, and battles, in the archean state,\r\nsimilar to the Holy War of our ingenious Bunyan; for, like the cobler\r\npoet, our theorist divided and subdivided his legions and their officers.\r\nThe archeus is merely the sovereign commander, whose head-quarters and\r\nthrone were in the stomach; all the other viscera have distinct\r\ncommandants, receiving their orders from their chief, who employed the\r\nnerves of his _aides-de-camp_. Nor was it an easy matter to keep all these\r\ncaptains in a proper state of discipline. Their irregularities occasioned\r\nconstant tumults; for the court of the archeus, like all other courts, was\r\nmost depraved and capricious in its practices, and intriguing in all its\r\nmachinations, and the archeus had great trouble in keeping his\r\nsubordinates in a proper state.\r\n\r\nThe most rebellious of his generals was the one who commanded the uterine\r\ndistrict. There it was in vain that the articles of war were constantly\r\nread,--that solitary confinement and prison-diet were resorted to. Its\r\nconstant mutinies not only demanded the utmost vigilance, but it was no\r\neasy matter to prevent its dangerous influence from contaminating the\r\nother branches of the service; and treasonable correspondences were not\r\nunfrequently discovered with the staff of the brain. This rebellious\r\nprovince, indeed, excited incessant apprehension, constantly agitated the\r\nentire commonwealth, and, on the plea of national welfare and liberty, it\r\nhoisted at times a standard of defiance, and precipitated the country in\r\nall the miseries of civil war; the more to be dreaded, as it always put\r\nforth the most specious pleas, destroying with words of peace.\r\n\r\nThis whimsical doctrine is not unlike the Platonic theories, and resembles\r\nthe _naturism_ or [Greek: enormon] of Hippocrates, and the autocracy of\r\nthe soul, of Stahl. Van Helmont not only established his archei in\r\nanimals, but in plants, and even in our food. The archeus of man he\r\nsometimes called _ens seminale_, _ens spirituale_, _impetum faciens_,\r\n_aura vitalis_. Well aware that the most powerful despot cannot reign\r\nwithout rival powers, Van Helmont admitted certain _imperia in imperio_:\r\nfor instance, there was a troublesome minister in his own cabinet, whom\r\nthe archeus frequently could not control,--one _pylorus rector_, or master\r\nof the ceremonies; then he had to apprehend the power of a secret faculty\r\npossessed by the stomach and spleen, which he called a _duumvirate_,--_jus\r\nduumvirat'_. The sensitive and immortal soul was another check on his\r\nsway; while the spirit of life residing in the blood was not easily\r\nmanaged. All these vexations occasioned frequent attacks of illness in the\r\nmonarch, and Van Helmont has described these several affections; for,\r\nalthough he possessed the power of conceiving and executing plans of\r\ndisease, like many physicians, he did not know how to cure himself.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that systems similar to this absurd doctrine, if not more\r\nextravagant, have ruled the medical schools for centuries with a despotic\r\nsway, can we marvel that medicine should have incurred the invectives of\r\nscepticism, or the scurrility of wits? In the very ratio of their\r\nabsurdity have these flitting systems been maintained with scholastic\r\nfury; their proselytes would have vied in excesses with monastic\r\npersecutors, had they been able to assume a religious mask. It is painful\r\nto observe that unbelief and impious ridicule in theologic matters may be\r\nreferred to the same causes as medical scepticism,--the vain and\r\npresumptuous endeavour of man to explain that which the CREATOR has most\r\nprobably willed to remain inexplicable. Instead of wisely referring all\r\nthat is mysterious to the Almighty Power that knows no limit, man has\r\nsought to explain and comment upon human principles, nay upon human\r\nmotives; and when they could no longer attribute evil to GOD, they crossed\r\nthe _pons asinorum_ to call in the Devil. In like manner, when they\r\nproudly fancied that they had regulated all the functions of the animal\r\neconomy in that harmonious manner that they were modest enough to call\r\nadmirable and wondrous, they endeavoured to account for a derangement of\r\nthis equilibrious condition, either by the introduction of some evil\r\nspirit, or the unmanageable rebellion of some organ, some principle, some\r\nagency, and for this purpose they gave individuality and specific vitality\r\nto those agents, each of the _dramatis personae_ having a particular part\r\nto perform in bringing on a tragic catastrophe or a happy _denouement_ of\r\nthe drama of life.\r\n\r\nLet not the learned doctors of modern schools exclaim, that these were the\r\nerrors of former days and of dark ages. They themselves are grovelling and\r\ngroping in the dark whenever they pretend to fly from the trammels of\r\nempiricism, and, like our forefathers, account for what is unaccountable.\r\nBut, above all, let them be meek and modest (if they can) in passing\r\njudgment upon others, and inscribe upon the doors of their splendid\r\nlibraries the saying of the olden sage, \"All that we know is our own\r\nignorance.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONSTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have puzzled their brains to no purpose in endeavouring to\r\naccount for the unnatural formation of animals. The ancients, amongst whom\r\nwe may name Democritus and Epicurus, attributing all organization to an\r\natomic aggregation, fancied that matter was endowed with an elective\r\nfaculty and certain volition in attaining this organism; and considered\r\nmonstruosities as mere experiments on the part of these atoms to produce\r\nsome other species or races. This chimera was of a par with the archeus\r\nand his satellites of the preceding article. There is no doubt, however,\r\nthat in the myriads of organized creatures various circumstances may tend\r\nto affect most materially the regularity of these developments, in the\r\nsame manner as the properties and peculiar qualities of their organs may\r\ndepend in a great measure upon similar influences. Conservation and\r\nreproduction are in the ratio of this perfection and imperfection. It is\r\ntrue, generally speaking, that the healthy and the best organized are less\r\nliable to engender an ill-conformed offspring; yet parents of this\r\ndescription have been known to produce monsters. Still the _fortes\r\ncreantur fortibus_ of Horace has become a proverbial expression; and some\r\nfanciful wanderers in the mazes of imagination framed rules for their\r\n_megalanthropogenesy_, or the art of creating illustrious men and\r\ndistinguished women by uniting the learned and the witty.\r\n\r\nGeneration is a wondrous mystery. Many casual circumstances may check the\r\nmechanism of its action, (if I may be allowed the expression,) and affect\r\nits results. Any sudden physical or moral impression acting violently\r\nmight produce this result; although, despite the theories and experiments\r\nof philosophers, it has not been proved that conception depends in the\r\nslightest degree upon the passions, being an act of nature totally\r\nindependent of the control of mental emotions or bodily sufferings. This\r\nfact is clearly proved in cases of brutal violence.\r\n\r\nThe ideas entertained by several naturalists, that organized beings were\r\ncast in a certain mould, were not altogether visionary, or unfounded in\r\nobservation. The great resemblance between children, and their hereditary\r\nmal-conformation and defectuosities in whole families, would seem to a\r\ncertain degree to warrant this conclusion; but it is more probable that\r\nimagination may have some influence in this irregularity, although at the\r\ntime we may be unconscious of the relative action of moral agency on\r\nphysical functions. The supporters of the existence of this plastic mould\r\nin which organized matter is cast, would then maintain that the mind\r\nhaving once influenced the conformation of the matrix, it would ever after\r\npreserve this deviation from nature's general laws.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that different species of animals and vegetables have\r\ndisappeared on the face of the earth, some within the memory of man. We\r\nneither know how these species have ceased to exist, nor whether all that\r\npossibly can be created has hitherto been brought into being; neither can\r\nwe form any idea regarding the perpetuity of the races that surround us.\r\nPerpetuity and eternity (as far as regards this world) are conventional\r\nterms: races were supposed to be perpetuated by the successive evolutions\r\nof germs, as I have observed in a former article. To a certain extent this\r\ndoctrine is correct, and is rendered evident in the evolutions of plants\r\narising from their seed. Preternatural conditions are merely\r\nirregularities in this germination. The doctrine, that at each creation a\r\ntrue generation and gradual formation of a new conception from the\r\nformless genital matter takes place, does not appear to me reconcileable\r\nwith sound physiology, nor supported by observation; for, were this the\r\ncase, it is more than probable that preternatural formations would be more\r\nfrequent. It was upon this doctrine that the learned Blumenbach founded\r\nhis _nisus formativus_, an expression that he thus explains: \"The word\r\n_nisus_ I have adopted chiefly to express an energy truly vital, and\r\ntherefore to distinguish it as clearly as possible from powers merely\r\nmechanical, by which some physiologists formerly endeavoured to explain\r\ngeneration. The point upon which the whole of this doctrine respecting the\r\n_nisus formativus_ turns, and which is alone sufficient to distinguish it\r\nfrom the _vis plastica_ of the ancients, or the _vis essentialis_ of\r\nWolff, and similar hypotheses, is _the union and intimate co-exertion of\r\ntwo distinct principles in the evolution of the nature of organized\r\nbodies_,--_of the_ PHYSICO-MECHANICAL _with the purely_\r\nTELEOLOGICAL;--principles which have hitherto been adopted, but\r\nseparately, by physiologists in framing theories of generation.\"\r\n\r\nThe ingenuity of this hypothesis must be admitted, but it does not\r\nmilitate against the pre-existence of germs. Germs are visible in the ovum\r\nbefore fecundation; in these germs the very primordia of future\r\norganization can be distinguished. It is by no means necessary to allow\r\nthese germs an exciting power, or a formative power, as has been objected:\r\nthey are more or less profuse, and under the influence, as I have already\r\nsaid, of accidental circumstances. It has been maintained that monsters\r\nare more common in domesticated animals than in wild ones. This is by no\r\nmeans evident, since we have little opportunity of ascertaining the case\r\nin forests and in wildernesses; but, admitting the fact, it only tends to\r\ncorroborate my opinion regarding the influence of accidental causes in\r\nphysical development, since domestication must expose animals to many\r\nemotions unknown in their natural condition. It has been said that\r\nmonsters are especially observed among sows. There perhaps is no animal\r\nunder the subjection of man, excepting, perhaps, the unfortunate donkey,\r\nmore exposed to physical injuries during gestation; and as the Portuguese\r\nmaintain that a _cajado_ (a stick) springs from the earth whenever an ass\r\nis born, so our bumkins and malicious urchins fancy that every one owes a\r\nkick to a gravid sow. Howbeit, I doubt much whether the swinish multitude\r\nare more subject to bear monstruosities than other animals; and\r\npreternatural conformations are, I believe, as frequent in lambs, and\r\ncalves, and chickens; and double-headed and double-legged specimens of\r\nthese animals are more frequently exhibited than monstrous pigs.\r\n\r\nMonstruosities are of two kinds, and exhibit either an excess of parts or\r\na defect. Thus, some children are born with more limbs than usual, whilst\r\nothers are deprived of their natural proportions. It is not unlikely that\r\nin the former case twins were being developed; whereas, in the other, the\r\nproper nourishment of the parts that are either wanting or stunted in\r\ntheir growth had somehow or other been impeded in its assimilation. This\r\nopinion seems to be warranted by the facts observed in the artificial\r\nincubation of eggs, the different parts of the chick being more or less\r\nperfect where the heat had been more or less steadily applied; the produce\r\nof those eggs that had enjoyed more warmth being invariably the stronger.\r\nThe same remark applies to plants. Eggs and seeds are in most respects\r\nruled by similar laws in the phenomena of their germination: the arms and\r\nlegs grow from the animal foetus, as the branches originate from the\r\ntrunk of the tree. These ramifications are frequently as symmetrical as\r\nhuman limbs. When there are preternatural excesses in formation, it is\r\nprobable that twins were intended: thus we see foetuses with double\r\nheads, or with two bodies. The same irregularity is observed in double and\r\ntriple cherries, and other fruits. It is probable that this union took\r\nplace when these bodies were in a soft state, and the vessels inosculated\r\nin their intricate ramifications with greater facility, until further\r\ndevelopment had consolidated the junction.\r\n\r\nIf a proof were wanting that monstruosities do not arise in the original\r\norganization of the embryo, but from subsequent accidents during\r\ngestation, it might be sought in those preternatural appearances that\r\narise from frights or longings, and constitute what are called _naevi\r\nmaterni_. Thus are infants born bearing the marks of some fruit the mother\r\nhad desired, or some animal that had terrified her. This phenomenon\r\nplainly shows that there does exist a wonderful sympathy between external\r\nobjects and the uterine system; yet this sympathy is not as surprising as\r\nthat which is subsequently observed between these marks and the fruit they\r\nrepresent. It is a well-authenticated fact that they will assume a tinge\r\nof maturity when the fruit is ripening, and become gradually more pale as\r\nit is going out of season. The same observation has been made in regard to\r\nanimal marks; for instance, these marks have displayed a deeper colour\r\nwhen the mouse or the rat that had occasioned them was mentioned. I know a\r\nlady who, during her pregnancy, was struck with the unpleasant view of\r\nleeches applied to a relative's foot. Her child was born with the mark of\r\na leech coiled up in the act of suction on the identical spot. Mr. Bennett\r\nhas published a remarkable instance of this uterine sympathy. A woman gave\r\nbirth to a child with a large cluster of globular tumours growing from the\r\ntongue, and preventing the closure of the mouth, in colour, shape, and\r\nsize exactly resembling our common grapes, and with a red excrescence from\r\nthe chest, as exactly resembling in figure and appearance a turkey's\r\nwattles. On being questioned before the child was shown her, she answered\r\nthat, while pregnant, she had seen some grapes, longed intensely for them,\r\nand constantly thought of them; and that she was also once attacked and\r\nmuch alarmed by a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\nVarious writers have positively denied these facts. Gerard tells us that\r\nhe had known three pregnant women whose minds had been constantly occupied\r\nwith the unpleasant recollections of a cripple, of a dancing-dog\r\nfantastically dressed, and a basket of beautiful peaches; yet their\r\noffspring bore no marks of these objects. This is no argument. No rational\r\nperson could imagine for a single moment that every impression thus\r\nreceived is to be transmitted. Buffon, who also doubts this influence,\r\nthus expresses himself: \"We must not expect that we shall be able to\r\nconvince women that the marks their children may bear have no analogy with\r\nungratified longings. I have frequently asked them, before the birth of\r\ntheir infants, what had been their wishes, and consequently what would be\r\nthe marks that they might expect? By this question I frequently gave\r\nunintentional offence.\"\r\n\r\nNow, with all due respect to this celebrated naturalist, this argument is\r\nby no means conclusive. We perfectly well know that pregnant women are\r\nfrequently alarmed without such consequences, and the most fantastic\r\nphantasies may cross their idle brains, without any such result. It has\r\nbeen observed on this subject, \"that when a circumstance may proceed from\r\nmany causes, we do not universally reject any one because it is frequently\r\nalleged without reason.\" We have too many well-authenticated cases before\r\nus to doubt this strange effect of maternal impressions, so clearly\r\nobserved and recorded in Holy Writ in the following passage of Genesis:\r\n\"And Jacob took him rods of Green poplar, and of the hazel and chestnut\r\ntree, and pilled white strakes in them, and made the white appear which\r\nwas in the rods. And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks\r\nin the gutters in the watering-troughs, when the flocks came to drink,\r\nthat they should conceive when they came to drink. And the flocks\r\nconceived before the rods, and brought forth cattle ring-straked,\r\nspeckled, and spotted.\"\r\n\r\nThe sympathy that evidently exists between bodies separated from each\r\nother, but previously connected, has given rise to many absurd stories. It\r\nis told of Taliocotius, that having made a nose for a patient, cut out of\r\na pig, the poor man's snout fell off the moment the hog was slaughtered. A\r\nsimilar belief prevails among horticulturists, who assert that the graft\r\nperishes when the parent tree decays. A very singular phenomenon is\r\nobserved in wine countries, where the wine in wood enters into a state of\r\nslight effervescence, and even efflorescence, when the vines begin to\r\nthrow out their blossoms.\r\n\r\nIt therefore appears to me more than probable that monstruosities are by\r\nno means original mal-conformations, but arise, during gestation, from\r\nphysical or moral influences that affect the mother, however unconscious\r\nshe may be of their action. We have frequent instances of violence\r\noccasioning preternatural developements. Mr. Giron Buzareingues mentions\r\nthat a violent blow was given to a gravid bitch, who produced eight pups,\r\nall of which excepting one, had the hind-legs wanting, malconformed, or\r\nweak.\r\n\r\nA further disquisition would lead me beyond the limits of a sketch. I\r\nshall therefore relate some curious cases of monstruosities, that would\r\nseem to set at nought our ideas regarding the _indispensability_ of\r\ncertain organs to the functions of life.\r\n\r\nVarious instances are recorded of the union of two or more foetuses. We\r\nhave lately seen the Siamese twins, and such a preternatural formation is\r\nby no means uncommon. In the Journal de Verdun, 1709, a case is related of\r\ntwo twin female children who were united at the loins, with only one\r\nintestinal canal. They were seven years old, could walk about, embrace\r\neach other in the fondest manner, and both were proficient in several\r\nlanguages. Buffon gives the history of two Hungarian girls, who were also\r\njoined together in the lumbar region. Helena, who was the first-born,\r\nbecame tall and straight; Judith, her sister, was of a diminutive size,\r\nand slightly arched. At six years of age she was attacked with hemiplegia,\r\nand never recovered perfect health. Helena was sprightly and intelligent.\r\nWith the exception of the smallpox and measles, under which they laboured\r\nat the same time, their ailments were always distinct. They lived until\r\nthe age of twenty-two, when Judith was attacked with a fever, that shortly\r\nterminated her existence. The horror expressed by Helena in beholding her\r\ndead companion, with whom she had been identified in sisterly love for so\r\nmany years, cannot be described; but her agonies were of short duration,\r\nfor in three minutes she also had ceased to live. On their _post mortem_\r\nexamination each was found to have possessed distinct viscera. The aorta\r\nand vena cava were united above the origin of the iliac arteries, so that\r\nno severing operation could have been performed without destroying them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nDuverney relates the case of twins united at the lower part of the\r\nabdomen. They only lived six days; the strongest of the two died first,\r\nand was followed by his companion three hours after. Haller records\r\nupwards of thirty cases of a similar nature; and various skeletons of\r\nthis description are to be seen in our museums. Munster saw two girls\r\nunited by the forehead. They had then attained their tenth year, when one\r\nof them died. It therefore became indispensable to separate them, but the\r\nunfortunate creature did not survive the operation. Daubenton describes\r\ntwo children united at the back of the head.\r\n\r\nSuch miserable junctions naturally suggested the idea of effecting a\r\nseparation by surgical means; but I believe this operation was only once\r\nperformed with a successful result. Two little girls were united from the\r\nxiphoid cartilage to the umbilicus. The uniting substance was an inch in\r\nthickness, six lines in breadth, and five inches in circumference. In the\r\ncentre of the junction was the umbilical ring common to both. The\r\numbilical vessels were separated and tied; the ligature fell at the\r\nexpiration of nine days; and then Zwingler, the operator, proceeded to\r\ndivide the remaining bonds.\r\n\r\nVarious monsters have been seen with four arms and three legs, or four\r\nlegs and two or three arms. The history of the double-headed infant of\r\nOxford is curious. This creature had two heads diametrically opposite,\r\nfour arms, one body and two lower extremities. These heads were doubly\r\nbaptized; one by the name of Martha, and the other Mary. The features were\r\ndifferent; Mary's was smiling, Martha's dejected. The latter died two days\r\nafter her birth, and Mary expired a quarter of an hour after.\r\n\r\nA curious monster of a similar description is recorded to have lived at\r\nthe court of James IV. of Scotland. It had been taught several languages,\r\nand music. One head was intelligent, the other remarkably stupid. This\r\ncreature lived twenty-eight years, when one of the individuals died. The\r\nother survived several days, but gradually drooped as the body of his late\r\ncompanion was decomposing. In olden writers we have many curious cases.\r\nHow far they may be entitled to credit I cannot say; although we have no\r\nreason to deny the fact, when we daily witness the most singular\r\nmalconformations. Liceti relates the case of a child with two legs, but\r\nseven heads and seven arms. Bartholinus mentions one with three heads,\r\neach of which uttered the most horrible cries, and then expired.\r\n\r\nWhile these unfortunates were visited with several heads, instances have\r\nbeen known of heads that had attained a most enormous volume. In Tunis,\r\nthere was a Moor of thirty years of age, whose head was so large, that\r\ncrowds followed him in the streets; and his mouth was of such a capacity,\r\nthat he could devour a large melon as easily as an apple. This man was an\r\nidiot. At Lucca, Benvenuti saw a lad, otherwise well-proportioned, whose\r\nhead at the age of seven began to increase so rapidly, that when he was\r\ntwenty-seven it measured thirty-seven inches eight lines in circumference,\r\nand his face was fifteen inches long.\r\n\r\nSingular monstruosities have been seen, where heads and bodies seemed\r\nactually to be growing from or hanging to individuals. Winslow knew an\r\nItalian child, of eight years of age, who carried a little head under the\r\nthird left rib, and peeping out as if the body of the one had been\r\nconcealed in that of the other. Both heads had been christened; the one\r\nJames, the other Matthew. When the ear of little Matthew was pinched, his\r\nhost James forthwith began to roar. The Bengal child, whose case is\r\nrelated by Valentin and Horne, is equally singular. Here one head was\r\nplaced above the other, the superior one nearly as well conformed as the\r\nlower; both adhered intimately. The upper face assumed somewhat of an\r\noblique direction. Each head had its distinct brain: sometimes one head\r\nwas fast asleep while his neighbour was wide awake, and one head would cry\r\nmost piteously if you pulled the hair of the other; but, what was still\r\nmore singular, when the one was fed, its companion expressed its\r\ngratification, and water flowed from its mouth. This monster lived four\r\nyears, and probably would have lived much longer, but for the bite of a\r\nvenomous reptile.\r\n\r\nIn a former article I alluded to encephalous and anencephalous cases,\r\nwhere there were either no heads or heads without brains. Of the first\r\nvariety Beclard relates the following: A woman at Angers was delivered of\r\ntwins, one of which not only was without a head, but only showed the\r\ninferior part of the body; without arms, a small stump-like excrescence\r\ngrowing from the upper part of the chest; the feet were turned inwards,\r\nand without toes. The creature was of the male sex. The body presented one\r\ncavity without any diaphragm; nor could any trace of liver, spleen,\r\noesophagus, or stomach be detected: the intestinal tube commenced at the\r\nupper part of the body, but was impervious; the pancreas and kidneys were\r\nas usual; the umbilical vein arose from the cava, and the umbilical\r\narteries from the hypogastric. There were ten ribs on each side, and the\r\nspinal marrow threw out its regular nerves.\r\n\r\nBrunel has recorded the case of a male infant born without brains. The\r\nfrontal bone was thrown back, and flattened on the sphenoid in such a\r\nmanner that the eyes appeared above his head. The parietal and the\r\nsquamous portion of the temporal were wanting, although the organ of\r\nhearing was well conformed. Not a vestige of brain could be discovered;\r\nyet the carotid and vertebral arteries crossed the basis of the cranium.\r\nThe spinal marrow arose from the fourth cervical vertebra. The organs of\r\nsight were perfect. Saviard describes an infant in which all the bones of\r\nthe cranium were wanting, and, instead of a brain, the skin merely covered\r\na cyst, containing a red pulpy substance resembling brain, whence arose\r\nseveral nerves.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, to these malconformations that we are to attribute the\r\nvarious stories of children with heads of monkeys, goats, pigs, &c., or of\r\nthat child whose face represented the devil, and who was described as\r\n\"Cacodaemonis picturae quam humanae figurae similius,\" &c. The idle tales of\r\nCyclopes are also to be sought in such accidental preternatural\r\nappearances, and several instances are recorded of children born with a\r\nsingle eye in the forehead. It would be useless to dwell longer on this\r\npainful subject. Those who wish for more information may gratify their\r\ncuriosity by consulting the works of Haller, Soemmering, and other\r\nwriters, who have treated this matter _ex professo_.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it appears to me that monstruosities are purely accidental,\r\nsubject to no laws of nature, but deviations from them. We leave to\r\ntheologasters the question of their being visitations of divine wrath. The\r\nonly theories that can admit of discussion are the following: 1st, The\r\nimagination of the mother; 2nd, Accidental causes; and 3rd, An original\r\nmonstrous germ. Maternal marks arising from longings and terror, as I have\r\nalready observed, seemed to warrant the first conclusion; yet it is not\r\ntenable. What has imagination to do with the vegetable kingdom, which also\r\npresents monstrous conformations? Are we to attribute the same power of\r\nimagination to the brute creation? and, although we may fully admit the\r\nsympathy that exists between the uterine system and external objects, yet\r\nwe cannot refer headless and double and triple embryos to this influence.\r\nThe last hypothesis is also fraught with objections. We have every reason\r\nto believe that all germs or seed are perfect in themselves. Were there\r\nmonstrous germs, there would ensue monstrous races. That germs may be\r\naccidentally vitiated and impaired there can be no doubt; but such an\r\nadventitious occurrence does not constitute an original monstruosity.\r\nDuverney and Winslow maintained that, in the case of a double monster, the\r\nmonstruosity arose in the primitive germ. Lemery and other physiologists,\r\non the contrary, insisted that double foetuses arise, as I have already\r\nstated, from a junction or fusion between two separate bodies, or, in\r\nshort, the union of twins or triple conceptions, &c. Anatomical\r\ninvestigations confirmed this opinion, since in double-headed foetuses\r\ntwo distinct sets of organs are generally found.\r\n\r\nThis subject has occupied the most ingenious philosophers for centuries;\r\nand the result of their experiments and debates seems to warrant the\r\nprobability of these melancholy deviations from nature, foolishly\r\ndenominated _lusi naturae_, being purely accidental. The experiments of\r\nJacobi seem to confirm this opinion, since he was able to produce\r\npreternatural fecundation in the eggs of fishes.\r\n\r\nThis investigation may appear idle; yet, in a physiological point of view,\r\nit is fraught with interest as regarding the generation of animals and\r\nplants. Its study affords a lively illustration of those laws of\r\nattraction and repulsion that regulate the universe, and which seem to\r\nadmit that every particle of matter should be endowed with a specific\r\nvitality, a specific individuality. This attraction is daily seen in the\r\nfecundation of the spawn of fish. Myriads of these eggs are accumulated in\r\nponds and rivers; yet in this mass the fecundating principle solely\r\nselects and impregnates those that naturally claim its vivifying powers.\r\nWonderful harmony, that man alone endeavours to destroy!--harmony so\r\nperfect, that Aristoxenus and Alcmaeon maintained that it was an emanation\r\nof the diapason of celestial music between the planets, our globe, and our\r\nfive senses, forming a diatonic series of seven tones; while Hippocrates\r\njustly denominated these organic laws the CONFLUXUS UNUS, CONSPIRATIO\r\nUNICA, CONSENTIENTIA OMNIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONGEVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater the complexity of a piece of machinery, and the more labour it\r\nis called upon to perform, the more rapid will be its wear and tear. This\r\napplies to human life as well as to mechanism. The derangement of its\r\ncomponent parts--its springs and wheels, will also be in the ratio of\r\ntheir complication. Thus do we find that the brute creation are less\r\nsubject to those affections that abridge their days than mankind. Their\r\nlife is natural, except when under the sway of domestication: ours is\r\nartificial; and high civilization tends to render it still more unnatural\r\nthan it would most probably have been in a simple and patriarchal\r\nexistence. Endowed with more acuteness of sensibility than animals, we are\r\nrendered more susceptible of the extremes of pleasure and of pain; and our\r\nvoluptuous enjoyments are perhaps more prejudicial than our sufferings.\r\nHad not the Creator wisely granted us the faculty of reasoning, we should\r\nhave been the most wretched of all organized beings.\r\n\r\nThe tenure of life depends upon the sum of vitality originally deposited,\r\nand the extent of our drafts upon this capital, which we too frequently\r\nexhaust by untimely expenses. Experience has proved that under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, man can live six or seven times longer than the years\r\nrequired to attain puberty. This epoch is placed at our fourteenth year.\r\nThis calculation would therefore yield from 84 to 98 years of age. Our own\r\nimprudences, and the disorders resulting from them, are more hostile in\r\nabridging this period than nature, all-wise and all-bountiful. Indeed,\r\nwhen we reflect on all the excesses to which we expose our frail and\r\ncomplicated being, as if we were resolved to try by every possible\r\nexperiment how far it possesses the power of resisting destructive agents,\r\nwe can only marvel in beholding so many instances of longevity. In this\r\nwasteful existence how many valuable hours do we not lose? how many real\r\nenjoyments have we not deprived ourselves of? When compared to the\r\nimmensity of time, life is but an idle span. Let us deduct even from old\r\nage the years of infancy, the years of caducity, and the years of\r\nsleep,--alas! what remaineth of our many and our energetic days?\r\nMaupertuis calculated that in an ordinary life man could scarcely enjoy\r\nmore than three years of happiness, mixed up with sixty or eighty years of\r\nmisery or insipidity; and yet how miserable are we at the thought of\r\nquitting this short-leased tenement, though every wretchedness renders our\r\nabode a constant scene of uneasiness. It has been computed that out of\r\nabout nine hundred millions of human beings that are scattered over the\r\nglobe, it is more than probable that we could not find nine thousand\r\nindividuals blessed with happiness, even taking happiness in its most\r\nlimited sense--content. Were it not for the terrors of futurity, it is\r\nmore than probable that our existence would lose much of its value.\r\nSocrates termed philosophy \"the preparation for death;\" the same may be\r\nsaid of our existence.\r\n\r\nHappily for man, life is a dream, all is illusion; sufferings alone are\r\npositive; Pandora's box is its best illustration. Could we have slept away\r\nour existence in constant visions, we should have lived as long as in a\r\nwaking state. When we contemplate the flocks of human beings scattered\r\nlike cattle on the face of the universe, with scarcely more intellect than\r\nthe beasts of the same field, we might ask for what were they created?\r\ndoomed to all the horrors of sickness or of war, victims of their own\r\nfollies or the ambitious projects of others! As far as regards this life,\r\nit is worse than idle to seek a solution of the problem. In these\r\ninquiries we too often seek to guess that which we can never know, and to\r\nknow that which we can never guess! We all complain and murmur like the\r\nwoodman in the fable, yet are loath to accept the relief we loudly call\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nThe longevity of the first races, and the patriarchs, are records foreign\r\nto the investigations of natural history; we must seek for more recent\r\nexamples. Haller had collected the cases of many centenaries, amounting to\r\nsixty-two who had reached from 100 to 120; twenty-nine from 120 to 130;\r\nand fifteen from 130 to 140. Few instances are authenticated beyond this\r\nperiod: yet we find one Eccleston, who lived 143 years; John Effingham,\r\nwho attained his 144th; a Norwegian, who counted a century and a half; and\r\nour Thomas Parr would most probably have passed his 152nd year but for an\r\nexcess. Henry Jenkins lived to 169; and we have on record the case of a\r\nNegress, aged 175. The Hungarian family of John Rovin were remarkable for\r\ntheir longevity: the father lived to 172, the wife to 164; they had been\r\nmarried 142 years, and their youngest child was 115; and such was the\r\ninfluence of habit and filial affection, that this _child_ was treated\r\nwith all the severity of paternal rigidity, and did not dare to act\r\nwithout his _papa's_ and _mamma's_ permission.\r\n\r\nBy the calculations of Sussmilch, out of one thousand individuals, only\r\none attained 97; and not more than one lived to the age of 100, out of one\r\nhundred and fourteen thousand. In the census of Italy, taken under\r\nVespasian, there were found fifty-four of 100, fifty-seven of 110, two of\r\n125, four of 130, and three of 140. In China, under Kien Long, in 1784,\r\nthere were only four individuals who had attained their 100th year.\r\nAccording to Larrey, there were at Cairo thirty-five persons who had\r\nexceeded their century. In Russia, in 1814, out of eight hundred and\r\nninety-one thousand six hundred and fifty deaths, were three thousand five\r\nhundred and thirty-one from 100 to 132. In a register of deaths in Paris,\r\ntaken in 1817, there were found in twenty-one thousand three hundred and\r\nninety-two, nine from 95 to 100, and the general proportion of centenaries\r\nin that city is one to three thousand.\r\n\r\nWhat are the circumstances most favourable to longevity? This question is\r\nnot easily answered; for we find in instances of advanced age that some\r\nindividuals have led a most regular and abstemious life, while others have\r\nindulged in various excesses. These observations, however, are by no means\r\ncalculated to form a conclusive opinion, as the constitutional vigour and\r\npeculiar idiosyncrasies of individuals differ widely. It is probable that\r\na regular mode of living is the most likely to prolong our years, whatever\r\nmay be that regularity in a comparative point of view. A sober man, who\r\ncommits occasional excesses, is more likely to suffer than another man who\r\ngets drunk every night, provided that these excesses do not differ in\r\nregard to the quantity or quality of stimulus. In these melancholy\r\ninstances the excitement is constant, and the indirect debility which it\r\nmay produce has scarcely time to break down the system ere it is again\r\nwound up to its usual pitch, to use the vulgar expression, \"by a hair of\r\nthe same hound.\" The principal attribute of life that renovates for a\r\nwhile its moral and its physical exhaustion is _excitability_, and a\r\nconstant _excitement_ is therefore indispensable, to serve as fuel to the\r\nconsuming fire. This was to a certain degree the basis on which Brown\r\nfounded his doctrine. He traced a scale of life like that of a\r\nthermometer,--health in the centre, death at each extremity: one scale\r\nascending from health was graduated according to stimulating agency, the\r\nother to debilitating causes; and therefore the system was to be\r\nstimulated or lowered according to this gradation. It would be foreign to\r\nthis work to point out the absurdity of this theory, although we must\r\nadmit its ingenuity, and to a certain extent its correctness. The chief\r\npractical objection to it was the diversity of constitutions and\r\nidiosyncrasies, and the different action of stimulating or depressing\r\nagents in health and in disease; the effects of alimentary and medicinal\r\nsubstances being totally different in these several conditions.\r\n\r\nAccording to habit, a certain sum of stimulus is requisite to keep up the\r\nnecessary excitement; and this sum cannot be immediately and suddenly\r\nwithdrawn in weak subjects without some risk; in health, perhaps, the\r\nexperiment may be safely made at all times, and under any circumstances,\r\nalthough it might be wiser to operate the change by degrees; and it must\r\nmoreover be recollected, that an habitual drunkard is in a morbid\r\ncondition, and must be treated accordingly.\r\n\r\nSix causes chiefly exert their influence upon life:\r\n\r\n1. Climate and soil.\r\n\r\n2. Difference of races.\r\n\r\n3. Complexion and stature.\r\n\r\n4. Period of development during gestation, and of subsequent growth.\r\n\r\n5. Mode of living.\r\n\r\n6. Moral emotions, occupations.\r\n\r\nClimates that are moderately cold are more favourable to long life. This\r\nobservation equally applies to the vegetable kingdom; and trees that have\r\nscarcely attained their full growth in northern regions are drooping in\r\nthe south. There also we find beasts and birds resisting the inclemency of\r\nthe weather by the thickness of their coats and plumage, or a layer of\r\ngrease; while many animals burrow in the earth to seek a state of torpor\r\nand insensibility, until restored to active life by a more genial\r\ntemperature. Dryness of soil is another source of health and life; and the\r\nhardy mountaineer's existence is seldom abridged by the diseases that\r\nvisit the inhabitants of damp and swampy regions. Steril plains are more\r\nsalubrious than regions covered with a rank and exuberant vegetation, or\r\nhighly cultivated grounds, from many obvious reasons. The humid earth is\r\nnot turned up, and decayed vegetable substances are not acted upon in a\r\ndeleterious manner by the solar heat. When we consider the various causes\r\nof disease that must abound in crowded and corrupt cities, we might\r\nimagine that mortality would be much greater than in the country; yet\r\nobservation has not proved this difference to be as material as one might\r\nexpect, at least as regards disease, the sad effects of poverty and\r\nstarvation not being taken into account. Various reasons may be assigned\r\nfor this apparent anomaly. In cities a more regular state of excitement\r\nprevails, and man's constant occupations scarcely give him time to attend\r\nto slight ailments, that, under other circumstances, might be aggravated.\r\nMoreover, intermittent fevers and visceral affections are more frequent in\r\nthe country; and cottagers are exposed to more constant damp and severer\r\nrevolutions in the atmospheric constitution than citizens. The mortality\r\namongst men is greater in cities than in women; the latter do not enjoy so\r\nlong a life in the country. March and April have been found the most fatal\r\nmonths. They are periods of atmospheric transition from cold to a higher\r\ntemperature, and must therefore prove trying to the weak and the aged. The\r\nend of autumn is also deemed a sickly period; and the equinoxes have ever\r\nbeen considered critical, the solstices much less injurious. In Great\r\nBritain and the north-westerly regions of Europe, northerly and easterly\r\nwinds are more prevalent in March, April, and May, owing, it is supposed,\r\nto the currents established to replace the warmer air, as it rises from\r\nthe surface of the Atlantic and more southerly countries. These winds are\r\ngenerally dry and cold, followed by fogs, and give rise to catarrhs,\r\nbronchial and pulmonary affections. It is calculated that in our climes\r\npulmonary affections carry off one-fifth of the population, or 191 in\r\n1000.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the variety of races, it has been observed that those people\r\nwho sooner attain pubescence are the shortest-lived. Precocious excitement\r\nmust bring on premature old age. Negroes seldom attain an advanced period\r\nof life; and the progress of years is more rapidly descried in their\r\nfeatures and their form than in Europeans who have migrated to their\r\nclime. The negroes of Congo, Mozambique, and Zanguebar, seldom reach their\r\nfiftieth year. In northern latitudes longevity is more frequent: this is\r\nobserved in Sweden, Russia, Poland, Norway. Some writers have looked upon\r\nthe established religion of a country as influencing the duration of life;\r\nand Toaldo asserted that Christians are shorter-lived than Jews. To this\r\nobservation it may be remarked, that Jews are in general a very sober,\r\nindustrious, and active race, circumstances that must materially tend to\r\nprolong their days. Moreover, by their legislation they are very careful\r\nin the choice of the meat they consume. In Catholic countries fasting may\r\nbe taken into calculation, not from the effects of abstemiousness, which\r\nwould be more favourable to health than injurious, but the sudden return\r\nto feasting and gormandizing, by way of revenge, when the fast is over.\r\nShrove Tuesday and Easter Sunday are noted in red letters in the\r\ngastronomic almanac; and the suppers that follow the midnight masses of\r\nChristmas generally require the apothecary's aid on the following\r\nmorning.[46]\r\n\r\nIn regard to conformation, very tall and spare subjects are seldom\r\nlong-lived; and the same observation applies to the stunted and\r\ndiminutive. A well-set body, with a broad and deep chest, a neck not\r\nover-long, with well-formed and firm muscles, generally hold forth a fair\r\nprospect of old age.\r\n\r\nChildren born before the regular period of gestation, those who have been\r\nweaned too early, or given to nurses whose milk was not of a proper\r\nquality, are seldom strong. Too rapid a growth will also shorten the space\r\nof existence.\r\n\r\nOur avocations and pursuits materially affect health and the consequent\r\nduration of life; and the nature of the excitement man is submitted to\r\nproduces a remarkable effect. It has been calculated in France that one\r\nhundred and fifty-two academicians, whose aggregate years were ten\r\nthousand five hundred and eleven, averaged sixty-nine years and two\r\nmonths. The following calculation of Madden will further illustrate this\r\ncurious subject.\r\n\r\n  AGES OF GREAT MEN.\r\n\r\n  _Natural Philosophers._\r\n\r\n  Bacon               78\r\n  Buffon              81\r\n  Copernicus          70\r\n  Cuvier              64\r\n  Davy                51\r\n  Kepler              60\r\n  Laplace             77\r\n  Leibnitz            70\r\n  Newton              84\r\n  Whiston             95\r\n  Euler               76\r\n  Franklin            85\r\n  Galileo             78\r\n  Halley              86\r\n  Herschel            84\r\n  Lalande             75\r\n  Lewenhoeck          91\r\n  Linnaeus             72\r\n  Tycho Brahe         75\r\n  Wollaston           62\r\n\r\n  _Poets._\r\n\r\n  Ariosto             59\r\n  Byron               37\r\n  Collins             56\r\n  Cowper              69\r\n  Dryden              70\r\n  Gray                57\r\n  Milton              66\r\n  Pope                56\r\n  Spenser             46\r\n  Thomson             48\r\n  Burns               38\r\n  Camoens             55\r\n  Cowley              49\r\n  Dante               56\r\n  Goldsmith           44\r\n  Metastasio          84\r\n  Petrarch            68\r\n  Shenstone           50\r\n  Tasso               52\r\n  Young               84\r\n\r\n  _Moral Philosophers._\r\n\r\n  Bacon               65\r\n  Berkeley            79\r\n  Condillac           65\r\n  Diderot             71\r\n  Fitche              52\r\n  Helvetius           57\r\n  Hume                65\r\n  Kaimes              86\r\n  Malebranche         77\r\n  Stewart             75\r\n  Bayle               59\r\n  Condorcet           51\r\n  Descartes           54\r\n  Ferguson            92\r\n  Hartley             52\r\n  Hobbes              91\r\n  Kant                80\r\n  Locke               72\r\n  Reid                86\r\n  St. Lambert         88\r\n\r\n  _Dramatists._\r\n\r\n  Alfieri             55\r\n  Goethe              82\r\n  Marlow              32\r\n  Racine              60\r\n  Shakspeare          52\r\n  Congreve            59\r\n  Crebillon           89\r\n  Farquhar            30\r\n  B.

There remain then, the ages at death of 318 persons on which the\r\npresent observation is made.\r\n\r\n\"From the ages of 50 years to the end of life, the _apparent_ rate of\r\nmortality among musicians, appears very nearly with the lowest known rate,\r\nor that which prevails in villages, and it is scarcely probable that such\r\nrate should so agree without being the true one. For a musician to belong\r\nto the last class of human life, is very credible, when it is considered\r\nthat eminence can only be attained by close mental devotion to an exalted\r\nscience, and unremitting application to its practical acquirement, which\r\nabstraction would interrupt and intemperance destroy.\r\n\r\n\"The mean age of musicians, born _since_ 1690, is 67-3/4 years, or two\r\nyears greater than those born before 1690, from which it might be\r\nconveniently concluded, that the moderns were longer lived than the\r\nancients. The case is precisely the reverse, at least for ages above 50,\r\nto which alone the materials are applicable. The expectation of life at\r\nthe age of 60 of the ancients were nearly 15 years, of the modern\r\nmusicians 13-1/2. The materials (limited as they are) from which these\r\nconclusions are drawn, support the doctrine, that the mortality of the\r\nmoderns is less at middle, but greater at advanced age, than the mortality\r\nof the ancients.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Caspar, of Berlin, in his late very interesting work on the duration\r\nof human life, has given the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n                  Medium longevity.\r\n  Clergymen              65\r\n  Merchants              62\r\n  Clerks                 61\r\n  Farmers                61\r\n  Military men           59\r\n  Lawyers                58\r\n  Artists                57\r\n  Medical men            56\r\n\r\nThe results of the other classes, with respect to their united ages, and\r\nthe average of each, are--\r\n\r\n                                                Average.\r\n  Moral philosophers   united ages       1417      70\r\n  Sculptors and painters                 1412      70\r\n  Authors on law and jurisprudence       1394      69\r\n  Medical authors   united ages          1368      68\r\n  Authors on revealed religion           1350      67\r\n  Philologists                           1323      66\r\n  Musical composers                      1284      64\r\n  Novelists and miscellaneous authors    1257      62-1/2\r\n  Dramatists                             1249      62\r\n  Authors on natural religion            1245      62\r\n  Poets                                  1144      57\r\n\r\nThis calculation was made most probably in Prussia.\r\n\r\nDr. Caspar's view of longevity are not only highly interesting but, if\r\ncorrect, may lead to many important conclusions. He maintains that--\r\n\r\n1. The female sex enjoys, at every period or epoch of life, except at\r\npuberty, at which epoch the mortality is greater among young females--a\r\ngreater longevity than the male sex.\r\n\r\n2. Pregnancy and labour occasion, indeed, a considerable loss of life, but\r\nthis loss disappears or is lost in the general mass.\r\n\r\n3. The so-called climacteric periods of life do not seem to have any\r\ninfluence on the longevity of either sex.\r\n\r\n4. The medium duration of life at this present time (1835), is in Russia,\r\nabout 21 years; in Prussia, 29; in Switzerland, 34; in France, 35; in\r\nBelgium, 36; and in England, 38 years.\r\n\r\n5. The medium duration of life has, in recent times, increased very\r\ngreatly in most cities of Europe.\r\n\r\n6. In reference to the influence of professional occupations in life, it\r\nseems that clergymen are on the whole, the longest, and medical men are\r\nthe shortest livers. Military men are nearly between the two extremes, but\r\nyet, proportionably they more frequently than others reach very advanced\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n7. The mortality is very generally greater in manufacturing than in\r\nagricultural districts.\r\n\r\n8. Marriage is decidedly favourable to longevity.\r\n\r\n9. The mortality among the poor is always greater than among the wealthier\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n10. The mortality in a population appears to be always proportionate to\r\nits fecundity--as the number of births increases, so does the number of\r\ndeaths at the same time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf this last assertion be correct, Malthus's doctrine must have been idle.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in general more males are born than females--this\r\ndifference has been attributed to the age of the parents; when the mother\r\nis older than the father the female offspring are more numerous--the same\r\nis observed when both parents have attained an advanced age--but when the\r\nfather's age exceeds that of the mother's, sons are chiefly the result of\r\ntheir union, it has been also observed that widowers are most frequently\r\nblessed with daughters.\r\n\r\nQuetelet has very justly observed that the laws which preside over the\r\ndevelopment of man, and modify all his actions, are in general the result\r\nof his organization, of his years, his state of independence, the\r\nsurrounding institutions, local influence, and an infinity of other\r\ncauses, difficult to ascertain, and many of which, most probably, never\r\ncan be known. Still if we admit the fact, our wellbeing, in a great\r\nmeasure, rests in our own hands, as the progress of our intellectual\r\nattainments may gradually enable us to improve our condition, in most of\r\nthe points to which we have alluded; and Buffon has observed \"that we know\r\nnot to what extent man may perfect his nature, both in a moral and a\r\nphysical point of view.\"\r\n\r\nStill the laws of our organization, and which regulate life, appear to be\r\nbeyond human speculation; and it has been observed that, under ordinary\r\ncircumstances, we are ruled by a harmonizing system tending to equalize\r\nsociety despite its institutions. Thus, births, marriages, and deaths,\r\nappear regulated on a certain scale in proportions singularly similar.\r\nThis circumstance is rendered obvious by the following tables of nativity\r\nat

minor\r\noffences and misdemeanors, of whom 85 in the 100 are condemned to various\r\npunishments, and the greatest annual calculation which Quetelet remarks in\r\nan annual budget, paid much more regularly than taxes, is as follows:\r\n\r\n  Condemned to capital punishment     100 to 150\r\n  To hard labour for life             280\r\n  Hard labour for a period           1050\r\n  Imprisonment

of\r\nbirths, deaths, and the commission of crimes? Are we ruled by _certain_\r\nlaws that are only changed in the manifestations of Providence, by\r\npeculiar visitations, such as war, famine, and pestilential maladies? What\r\na vast and curious field of research and reflection! what an argument for\r\nthe fatalist! Man no doubt possesses a moral power that to a certain\r\nextent subjugates the creation to his influence and his will. Plants and\r\nanimals seem to obey certain natural laws, that are only disturbed by\r\nperturbative agents; and it is difficult to point out what are the human\r\nactions that arise from natural impulses, or from accidental\r\ncircumstances, although experience would tend to show that they bear a\r\nsingular proportion in the similarity of their results; and one must come\r\nalthough reluctantly to the conclusion, that this perturbative power\r\nexercises but a slender influence on the laws of nature, which seem to set\r\nat defiance the destructive efforts of man. Thus have we seen of late\r\nyears, that the most fearful and long-protracted wars, which one might\r\nhave imagined would have devastated the fairest parts of Europe, have not\r\nchecked a surprising increase in its population, and the destructive\r\neffects of the most fatal pestilence have vanished with a promptness that\r\nseemed to keep pace with the preceding havoc. Bigotry and fanaticism are\r\nthe only scourges which appear to dare the benevolent views of Providence,\r\nand when we traverse the desolate fields of most Roman Catholic countries,\r\none would imagine that Heaven has abandoned their inhabitants to their own\r\nblind wills and evil ways. Spain at this period and at many epochs of her\r\nbloody history, seems to corroborate the fable of the Titans who sought\r\nrefuge in that ill-fated land from the anger of the gods.[48]\r\n\r\nTo return: we find in the preceding _resumes_ of longevity that poets are\r\nthe shortest-lived; next to them, authors on natural religion, dramatists,\r\nand novelists. May not this circumstance be attributed to the fervour of\r\ntheir imagination and to their unequal mode of living? A species of\r\nmadness is the attribute of genius. Many authors on natural religion may\r\ncome under the denomination of monomaniacs. The jealous irritability of\r\npoets and dramatists,--and next to them in the scale of vanity we find\r\nmusicians,--may also contribute to wear them out, and bring on various\r\nchronic diseases, by digestive derangements; more especially as their\r\nhabits of living are seldom regular, fits of sobriety alternating with\r\nbouts of merry-making. Moral philosophers, painters, and sculptors, whose\r\naverage life appears the longest, follow more sedentary pursuits; and,\r\nalthough artists in general cannot boast of remarkable discretion in their\r\nmode of living, the nature of their profession requires much steadiness.\r\nIt is moreover to be observed that, in the preceding calculation,\r\nhistorical painters have chiefly been noticed. Would the same calculation\r\napply to the lighter branches of the art? It has been remarked that actors\r\ngenerally attain old age, notwithstanding the fatiguing and harassing\r\nnature of their profession. This may be attributed to the constant\r\nexcitement of a similar nature to which they are subject, as well as to\r\ntheir continued exposure to the sudden transitions from heat to cold,\r\nwhich renders them less susceptible of the variations of temperature that\r\naffect those who can avoid these vicissitudes. Any person who would expose\r\nhimself to the constant checked perspirations to which dancers are liable,\r\nwould infallibly pay dear for the experiment; and those who have had\r\noccasion to witness the fatigues of their exercises, marvel at their not\r\nbeing constantly attacked with pulmonary inflammation, and the many\r\nmaladies that result from similar exposures. On the very same principle,\r\ntroops when engaged upon active service do not suffer from the inclemency\r\nof the weather, although saturated with wet by day, and sleeping under\r\ntorrents of rain by night. So long as they are marching with an object in\r\nview, this excitement supports them, even against hunger; but the moment\r\nthis excitement ceases, let them halt, in tranquil cantonments, or\r\ncommence a retreat under unfavourable circumstances, that moment the\r\ninvasion of disease is observed. The chief source of health and long life\r\nis an equilibrious state of the circulation. This condition a moderate\r\nmental excitement tends to maintain. Depression, on the contrary, will\r\nproduce a languid flow of the vital stream, congestion, and chronic\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\nOn the same principle, good temper and hilarity are also necessary to\r\nprolong life. Violent passions must tend to occasion dangerous\r\ndeterminations, while the inward gnawings of offended vanity and pride\r\ncorrode every viscus, and lay the seeds of future mental and bodily\r\nsufferings. Apathy and insensibility are, unfortunately, the best sources\r\nof peace of mind, and as Fontenelle observed, a good stomach and a bad\r\nheart are essential to happiness. Perhaps the best maxim to prolong our\r\ndays, and render them as tolerable as possible, is the \"_Bene vivere et\r\nlaetari_.\"\r\n\r\nI have just observed that conformation materially affects our existence;\r\nand this circumstance may in a great measure be referred to temper, and\r\nthe wear and tear that it occasions in ill-conditioned individuals. Little\r\npeople seldom attain the longevity of stronger individuals; and it is also\r\na well-known fact that diminutive persons are generally spiteful and\r\nmalicious. As Providence has bestowed destructive venoms on reptiles, so\r\nhas it gifted these insignificant members of society with obnoxious\r\nqualities, to make amends for their want of physical power in the\r\nstrategies of attack and defence. The same observation holds good with the\r\ndeformed; but here we have a moral cause for this sourness of disposition.\r\nThey too frequently are objects of ridicule, contempt, or pity, sentiments\r\nthe most humiliating to mankind. In childhood they are not able to partake\r\nof the boisterous and active sports of their companions; they have not the\r\npower to resent an injury, and the more powerless we are, the greater is\r\nour thirst of revenge. Hence does tyranny degrade, and renders its victims\r\ncruel and vindictive. The deformed, moreover, find it necessary to improve\r\ntheir intellectual faculties, which in aftertimes fill their quivers with\r\nkeen shafts of retaliation. In this study they also have more leisure, and\r\nthey apply to their books while their comrades are at play. This very\r\nstudy adds to their sense of inferiority; they can never hope to share the\r\nwarrior's laurels, or, what is perhaps still more painful, the myrtle of\r\nsuccessful love. Their only chance of success in either of these careers\r\nis by kindling wars by their intrigues, or winning a woman's heart by\r\nintellectual superiority,--two very improbable events. Thus they gradually\r\nenvy men who are looked upon by the world as their superiors, and hate\r\nwomen for the preference they show to those privileged individuals. In\r\ngeneral we find these ill-shaped beings bitterly sarcastic whenever\r\nwoman's name is mentioned. Pope, perhaps from these very reasons, was\r\ninexhaustible in his abuse of the sex: and Boileau abhorred them, since he\r\nhad been emasculated by a turkey-cock.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual superiority of hunchbacks has also been attributed to\r\ntheir physical condition; and it is generally believed that with them the\r\ncirculation of blood in the brain is more rapid than in well-conformed\r\nsubjects, and this increased action is supposed to contribute materially\r\nto the vivacity of the imagination, and the quickness of apprehension.\r\nAnother circumstance is said to increase their mental powers, and that is,\r\ntheir continence, considered both by the ancients and the moderns as a\r\nsource of intellectual energies. Minerva and the Muses were virgins; and\r\nin this and other fabulous traditions, we find the ancients illustrating\r\nin their mythologic allegories many physical facts and observations. Our\r\nBacon had made the same remark; and Newton, and many other great men,\r\nconsidered the passion of love beneath the dignity of science. Continence\r\nand abstinence were deemed by Horace as indispensable privations in the\r\ncultivation of genius. In the deformed both are to a certain degree\r\nnatural, or at least cannot be lost sight of without endangering life. The\r\ndigestive powers of the deformed are generally weak; and this debility has\r\never been looked upon as a concomitant of superior intellects. Thus in\r\nCelsus, \"_Imbecilli stomacho pene omnes cupidi litterarum sunt_;\" while on\r\nthe contrary, \"_Obesus venter non parit subtilem intellectum_.\"\r\n\r\nThe common expression of a child being too clever to live, is\r\nunfortunately founded on observation. Scrofulous and sickly children are\r\nin general remarkable for the quickness of their intellects; and Rousseau\r\nmaintained that a man who could meditate was a depraved animal. It is a\r\nfact that the perfection of one faculty can seldom be attained but at the\r\nexpense of others. The more our faculties are generally called into\r\naction, the less perfect will they be individually;--\"_Pluribus intentus,\r\nminor est ad singula_.\" Thus, the singing of birds is improved by\r\ndepriving them of sight.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the mind upon our health is as evident as the influence\r\nof our health in the duration of existence. This corollary explains the\r\nshortness of life of the diminutive and the deformed, unconnected with\r\nsuch physical defects of organization as might impede the due exercise of\r\ntheir organs.\r\n\r\nThe fable of Prometheus is a strong illustration of the pernicious effects\r\nof intemperance; and by Darwin, and other physiologists, has been\r\nconsidered as comparing the celestial fire that he purloined, to the\r\nartificial inspirations of excitement that ultimately preys upon the liver\r\nand the other viscera like a voracious vulture. A much deeper philosophy\r\nis concealed in this theogenic allegory. Prometheus was the son of\r\nJapetus; brother to Atlas, Menoetius, and Epimetheus, who all surpassed\r\nmankind in fraud and in guilt. Prometheus himself scoffed the gods, and\r\nviolated their shrine. Heaven and Earth had formed his father, who had\r\nunited his destinies with Clymene, one of the Oceanides. Thus Prometheus\r\nand Epimetheus arose from the very cradle of the universe; and their very\r\nnames, [Greek: Promandanein] and [Greek: Epimandanein], signify foresight\r\nand improvidence,--_praediscere et postea discere_,--the prevalent\r\ncharacteristics of all mortals, that either tend to promote or retard the\r\nprogress of human reason and human happiness. Prometheus strove impiously\r\nto possess himself of Divine knowledge, and created man with a base\r\namalgam of earth and the bones of animals, vivified by the celestial fire\r\nhe had obtained. Jupiter, indignant at his audacity, commanded Vulcan to\r\ncreate a beauteous tempter in the form of woman, on whom every attractive\r\ngift might be conferred; and Pandora was sent upon earth with the fatal\r\npresent of the father of the gods, the box that contained all the evils\r\nand distempers that were destined for mankind. The foresight of Prometheus\r\nresisted her charms; his improvident brother opened the dreaded casket.\r\nHave we not here an illustration of the vanity of science, that aims even\r\nat Divine attributes, and whose votaries, like Prometheus, would\r\nendeavour, if possible, to deprive wisdom of her power, and break down the\r\nboundaries of human intellects? His punishment describes in energetic\r\nlanguage the endless and consuming studies of the learned, whose very\r\nviscera are corroded in lucubrations too often fruitless, and not\r\nunfrequently injurious to themselves and others. Hercules alone could\r\nrelieve him from his torments:--and does not Hercules in this allegory\r\ntypify the power of reason, that enables us to release the mind from the\r\ntrammels both of ignorance and vanity, separated from each other by a\r\ngossamer partition? Prometheus, who could resist the most powerful of\r\ntemptations,--beauty and talent combined,--dared Olympus to seek for that\r\nwisdom which would have doomed him to everlasting sufferings, had not\r\nstrength of mind and the powers of reflection destroyed his merciless\r\ntormentor. Can we be surprised that the ancients consecrated games to this\r\nbeautiful allegory?--games that are still carried on in our days; but,\r\nalas! where every vain competitor pretends that he has reached the goal\r\nwith an unextinguished torch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRETINISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis singular disorder was first discovered and noticed by Plater, about\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century, among the poor inhabitants of\r\nCarinthia and the Valais, where, as in the valleys of the Lower Alps and\r\nthe Pyrenees, it is also found to be an endemic affection. According to\r\nSir George Staunton, it is also observed in Chinese Tartary. It has been\r\nerroneously confounded by some writers with bronchocele and rachitis, from\r\nboth of which it is totally distinct.\r\n\r\nCretinism presents various modifications in kind, and every intermediate\r\ngrade between that extreme degree of physical and mental debasement which\r\nis characterized by the utmost deformity, and entire absence of mental\r\nmanifestation, the organic and vegetative functions only being performed.\r\nThere are certain circumstances that distinguish cretins from idiots; and\r\ntheir infirmities appear to depend upon endemic or local causes, regarding\r\nwhich much diversity of opinion has prevailed both amongst medical men and\r\ntravellers.\r\n\r\nThe cretins were also called _Cagots_ and _Capots_. In Navarre these\r\nunfortunates go by the name of _Gaffos_ and _Ganets_; and in various\r\nvalleys of the Pyrenees they are called _Gezits_ or _Gezitains_. Near La\r\nRochelle, some of them are also found, and there they are known by the\r\nappellation of _Coliberts_; and in Britanny _Cacons_ and _Cagneux_. The\r\nderivation of these names shows the contempt and disgust that they\r\nexcited,--_Cagot_, according to Scaliger, being derived from _Canis\r\nGottus_, or _Dog of a Goth_; _Colibert_ is traced to _quasi libertus_, or\r\nslave. The Spaniards call them _Gavachos_, a term of reproach, which they\r\nalso applied to the French during the Peninsular struggle.\r\n\r\nThe body of these poor creatures is stunted, their height not exceeding\r\nfour feet. There is a total want of due proportion between it and the\r\nother parts, the height of the head with reference to the body being from\r\none-fourth to one-fifth, instead of one-eighth, the natural proportion;\r\nthe neck is strong, and bent downwards; the upper limbs reach below the\r\nknees, and the arm is shorter than the fore-arm; the chest narrow, the\r\nabdomen hemispherical, and of a length not exceeding the height of the\r\nhead; the thighs, with the haunches, of greater width than the shoulders,\r\nand shorter than the legs, the calves of which are wanting; the feet and\r\ntoes distorted. In the head, the masticating organs, the lower jaw, and\r\nthe nose, preponderate considerably over the organs of sense and\r\nintelligence; the skull is depressed, and forms a lengthened and angular\r\nellipsis; the receding forehead presents internally large frontal sinuses,\r\nto which the brain has yielded part of its place; the top of the head is\r\nflattened, instead of being vaulted; the occiput projects but slightly,\r\nand runs almost even with the nape of the neck, as in ruminating animals.\r\nThe face is neither oval nor round, but spread out in width; the eyes are\r\nfar apart, slightly diverging, small, and deep-seated in their orbits; the\r\npupil contracted, and not very sensitive to light; the eyelids, except\r\nwhen morbidly swollen, are flaccid and pendent. Their look is an unmeaning\r\nstare, and turns with indifference from every thing that is not eatable.\r\nThe elongated form of the lower jaw, the thick and puffed lips, give them\r\na greater resemblance to ruminating creatures than to man. The tongue is\r\nrather cylindrical than flat, and the saliva is constantly running from\r\nthe angles of their mouth. Enlargement of the thyroid glands generally\r\nprevails, sometimes to an enormous extent. Indeed, this appearance is\r\ncommonly considered as a distinguishing sign of cretinism. The other\r\nglands of the throat are also obstructed. Many of these poor wretches are\r\nboth deaf and dumb; yet do they appear unconscious of their miserable\r\nexistence. Stretched out or gathered up under the solar rays, their head\r\ndrooping in idiotic apathy, they are only roused from their torpor when\r\nfood is presented to them.\r\n\r\nThis endemic malady is supposed to arise from the use of snow-water, or of\r\nwater impregnated with calcareous earth. Both of these opinions are\r\nwithout foundation. All the inhabitants of districts near the glaciers,\r\ndrink snow and ice waters without being subject to the disorder; and the\r\ncommon waters of Switzerland, strongly impregnated with calcareous\r\nsubstances, are most salubrious. At Berne, the waters are extremely pure,\r\nyet Haller observed that swellings of the throat are not uncommon. De\r\nSaussure has assigned another cause, and refers the disorder to the\r\nphysical features of the mountainous districts in which it prevails. The\r\nvalleys, he tells us, are surrounded with very high mountains, sheltered\r\nfrom currents of fresh air, and exposed to the direct, and what is worse,\r\nthe reflected rays of the sun. They are marshy, and hence the atmosphere\r\nis humid, close, and oppressive. When to these chorographical causes, he\r\nfurther says, we add the domestic ones, which are also well known to\r\nprevail among the poor of these regions,--such as innutritious food,\r\nindolence, and uncleanliness, with a predisposition to the disease from an\r\nhereditary taint of many generations,--we can sufficiently account for the\r\nprevalence of cretinism in such places, and for the most humiliating\r\ncharacters it is ever found to assume.\r\n\r\nThis specious reasoning, however, is overthrown by observation. In the\r\nfirst instance, this character of the country does not affect its other\r\ninhabitants; and secondly, the _goitre_ is found in warm latitudes, and\r\nMungo Park observed it amongst the Africans of Bambara, on the banks of\r\nthe Niger. Marsden has also seen it at Sumatra. Moreover, this affection\r\nis scarcely ever seen in the mountains, but principally prevails in the\r\nvalleys.\r\n\r\nIt is more than probable that these ill-favoured creatures belong to a\r\nparticular race; for we must take care not to confound goitre with\r\ncretinism, since goitre is common where cretinism is prevalent. It has\r\nbeen remarked that the offspring of the natives of the Valais who\r\nintermarry with persons from the Italian side of the Alps, are more\r\nsubject to goitres than those born of native parents; and that females who\r\nhave husbands from the higher Alps, seldom have children affected with\r\nthis infirmity. It is pretty clear that in these observations, goitre and\r\ncretinism are confounded.\r\n\r\nThat these miserable cagots belong to a particular race of men, most\r\nprobably accidentally degraded in their transmission from our primitive\r\nstock, appears most likely. We have sought the derivation of the several\r\nterms of contempt and disgust attached to them in different countries, to\r\nwhich migration may have led their parents. Some writers have traced their\r\ndescent to the Goths and Vandals, thus chastised for their devastations.\r\nGebelin, Belleforet, and Ramont consider them as descendants of the\r\nVisigoths; while Marca, bishop of Couserans, denounces them at once as\r\nJews and Saracens; and other clerical writers have maintained that they\r\nare the miserable relicts of the heretic Albigenses who had escaped the\r\nholy massacres of 1215; although there did exist cagots in the year 1000,\r\nin the abbey of St. Luc, as they are described in a _for_ of Navarre,\r\nbearing date 1074, and issued by Ramirez.\r\n\r\nThese helpless beings have also been considered as the offspring of\r\nBohemians and gipsies. Bishop, or rather Senator Gregoire, maintained that\r\nthey sprung from the hordes of northern barbarians who overran the south\r\nof Europe in the third and fourth centuries. Whatever might have been the\r\norigin of these poor creatures, they seem to share that ignominious\r\ndestiny that has marked various races in different countries. The _Agotos_\r\nof Navarre, the _Maragotos_ of Leon, the _Batuecos_ of Castile, the\r\n_Wendes_ of Silesia, are all held in as much contempt as the _Parias_ and\r\nthe _Vaddahs_ of India. Even in Otaheite a degraded caste was found, from\r\nwhich victims were selected to appease Divine wrath, or propitiate their\r\ngods.\r\n\r\nThe traditional contempt in which certain races are held, a contempt that\r\nseems to have affected their physical appearance, may perhaps be traced to\r\nthe degradation of slavery, that seems to deprive man of all his proud\r\nattributes, both in a moral and physical point of view. The effects of\r\ntyranny, and the distinctions that oppression has created in the several\r\ncastes and ranks of mankind, are every where evident. What a difference\r\nexists in Scotland between the chieftains and the humbler individuals of\r\ntheir clans!--between the naires of India and their vassals! In France,\r\nsaid Buffon, you may distinguish by their aspect, not only the nobility\r\nfrom the peasantry, but the superior order of nobility from the inferior,\r\nthese from the citizens, and citizens from the peasants. \"The field-slaves\r\nin America,\" observes the enlightened Dr. Smith, \"are badly clothed, fed,\r\nand lodged, live in small huts in the plantations, remote from the example\r\nand society of their superiors. Living by themselves they retain many of\r\nthe customs and the manners of their ancestors. The domestic servants, on\r\nthe other hand, who are kept near the persons or employed in the families\r\nof their masters, are treated with great lenity, their service is light,\r\nthey are well fed and clothed. The field-slaves, in consequence of their\r\ncondition, are slow in changing the aspect and figure of Africa; while the\r\ndomestic servants have advanced far before them in acquiring the agreeable\r\nand regular features, and the expressive countenance, of civilized\r\nsociety. The former are frequently ill-shaped; they preserve in a great\r\ndegree the African lips, and nose, and hair; their genius is dull, and\r\ntheir countenances sleepy and stupid. The latter are straight and well\r\nproportioned; their hair extends to three or four, sometimes even to six\r\nor eight inches; the size of their mouth is handsome, their features\r\nregular, their capacity good, and their looks animated.\" Dr. Prichard has\r\nalso stated that similar changes become visible in the third and fourth\r\ngenerations in the West India islands; and I have seen several negresses\r\nin those colonies perfectly beautiful. In the Bahama islands I knew a\r\nfemale slave of the name of Leah, belonging to my late friend Mr.\r\nCommissary Brookes, as black as jet, and descended in the third\r\ngeneration from African parents, whose features would have vied in\r\nsymmetry with the fairest specimen of the Caucasian race.\r\n\r\nLet us not, therefore, seek in snow-water or calcareous impregnations for\r\nthe causes of deformity and degradation in any unfortunate castes of\r\nmankind. Their misery may more probably be traced to the iron rod of\r\ndespotism, or the oppression of bigotry,--influences that mark out races\r\nas abject slaves, or objects of Divine wrath, that ought to be scorned by\r\nthe wealthy and the powerful, and spurned and persecuted by the faithful\r\nand the elect; although, when it has served its purposes, priestcraft has\r\nheld up the cagot, and the leper, and the idiot, as objects of veneration.\r\nWhen the tourist, in his Alpine and Pyrenean excursions, meets a wretched\r\ncagot, let him pause and contemplate the offspring of slavery, and reflect\r\non what man is, and on what man might be,--nay, on what man _will_ be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERAMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe different prevalent propensities in various individuals, the\r\ndevelopment of which appeared to be under the influence of a certain and\r\nconstitutional organization, have received the name of temperaments; or,\r\nrather, this term applies to this peculiar organization of the\r\nconstitution or idiosyncrasy. The Greek physiologists were the first to\r\nclassify these peculiarities, or _temperamenta_,--the _naturae_ of\r\nHippocrates, the _mixturae_ of Galen. They considered organized bodies as\r\nan assemblage of elements endowed with different properties, but combined\r\nin such manner that their union should constitute a whole, in which none\r\nof them should predominate in a healthy condition; but, on the contrary,\r\nthey were to modify and _temper_ each other, their simultaneous action\r\nbeing directed and controlled by the spirit of life, _spiritus_. It was\r\nthe due combination of these elements that constituted a perfect\r\ntemperament; their aberrancy produced disease of body or of mind.\r\n\r\nThe ancients divided these elements into cold and hot, dry and moist; from\r\nthe combination of these principles they classified the fluids of the\r\nbody. The blood was hot and moist, the bile hot and dry, the phlegm cold\r\nand damp, and the melancholy cold and dry. This division led to a further\r\nclassification; and temperaments, according to the predominance of these\r\nelements, were divided into the _sanguineous_, the _bilious_, the\r\n_phlegmatic_, and the _melancholic_.\r\n\r\nThese supposed radical fluids, influencing the whole animal frame, were\r\ndependent upon certain organs for their specific production. The blood was\r\nfurnished by the heart, the phlegm by the head, the yellow bile by the\r\ngall-duct, and the black bile or atrabile,--the principle of\r\nmelancholy,--by the spleen. Notwithstanding the many revolutions in the\r\ndoctrine of physiology that have shaken the schools since the days of\r\nHippocrates, this classification of his has remained to a certain degree\r\nto the present day, and has laid the foundation of all the systems of\r\ntemperaments, constitutions, and natural characters, that have at various\r\nperiods been advanced by philosophers; the only novel introduction in this\r\nancient classification being the nervous temperament, which, after all, is\r\nonly a modification of the four other categories.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate the operations of these temperaments, it became necessary to\r\nadopt terms expressive of their combination, and _temper_ and _humour_\r\nwere adopted. Both are Latin terms; the first, in its original sense,\r\nimports mingling, modifying, tempering the four radical fluids, and\r\nproducing that equilibrious condition of the frame, termed _constitution_.\r\n_Humour_ was derived from the Greek [Greek: chumos], _chumos_; and its\r\nradical sense imported moisture, or fluid of any kind. Hence _humid_ and\r\n_humidity_. This doctrine of fluidity is still applied to many functions\r\nthat we cannot otherwise describe, and we talk, although in a figurative\r\nmanner, of the nervous fluid, the vital fluid; and a good humour, a bad\r\nhumour, a vein of humour, or a humorous vein, are illustrations of\r\npeculiar tempers and temperaments,--for temperaments are still\r\ndistinguished by the same terms applied to them by the ancients, and we\r\ndescribe one man as _choleric_, or bilious, for _choler_ ([Greek: chole])\r\nmeans bile; another as being _melancholic_; a third of a _sanguine\r\ndisposition_; and a fourth of a _phlegmatic habit_. The _sanguine_, that\r\nimports a predominance of the blood, indicated a warm and ardent\r\nexuberance of spirits; whereas the _phlegmatic_, denoting a thin and cold\r\nwatery fluid, referred to a frigid and spiritless indolence.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that modern physiology has scarcely advanced this branch of\r\nscience, for the _nervous temperament_ may be considered as merely a\r\nmodification of the other ones; and it is more than probable that the old\r\nclassification will long prevail, notwithstanding the ingenuity of modern\r\nhypotheses. Husson divided the temperaments into those that referred to\r\nthe vascular system, to the nervous system, and to the muscular system,\r\nwith subdivisions applied to regions and to organs; all these temperaments\r\nbeing either natural and primitive, or acquired. Dr. Thomas, of Paris, has\r\nfounded his arrangement according to the predominance of the head, chest,\r\nor abdomen,--or the mental, circulatory, or digestive organs,--and\r\naccording to the relative bulk and predominance of these three regions\r\nwill be the relative energy of the mental, muscular, or abdominal\r\nfunctions. Notwithstanding the ingenuity of these systems, the old\r\narrangement, as I have already observed, is likely to prevail; and as\r\nBlumenbach observes, that although this division was founded on an\r\nimaginary depravation of the elements of the blood, if made to stand alone\r\nit will prove both natural and intelligible.\r\n\r\nThis division I shall therefore endeavour to illustrate. In the\r\n_sanguineous temperament_ the heart and arteries possess a predominant\r\nenergy; the pulse is strong, frequent and regular; the veins blue, full,\r\nand large; the complexion florid, the countenance animated, the stature\r\nerect, the muscular forms marked and firm; the hair of a yellow, auburn,\r\nor chestnut colour; the nervous impressions acute, the perception quick,\r\nthe memory retentive, the imagination lively and luxuriant, the\r\ndisposition passionate but not vindictive, and passion is easily appeased;\r\namorous, and fond of conviviality and good cheer.\r\n\r\nIn this temperament we find athletic strength and fortitude of mind in\r\nresisting the power of external agency, with mental tranquillity in the\r\nmidst of danger; a calmness arising from a consciousness of power, and\r\nfrom less acuteness of external impressions and mental perceptions. Such a\r\nman, when roused to action, will endeavour to surmount every physical\r\ndifficulty; but he will rarely attain pre-eminence in sciences and the\r\nfine arts, which require exquisite sensibility and mobility,--qualities\r\nseldom met with in such forms as those described by the poets in Hercules\r\nand Ajax.\r\n\r\nIn the _choleric_ or _bilious_ temperament the liver and biliary organs\r\nare as redundant in their power as the sanguineous vessels, and, for the\r\nmost part, at the expense of the excernent or cellulous and lymphatic\r\nsystem. The pulse is strong and hard, but more frequent than in the\r\nsanguineous; the veins superficial and projecting; the sensibility\r\nextremely acute and easily excited, with a capacity of pondering for a\r\nlong time on the same object. The skin is sallow, with a tendency to a\r\nyellow tinge; the hair black or dark brown; the body moderately fleshy,\r\nthe muscles firm and well marked, the figure expressive; the temper of the\r\nmind abrupt, impetuous, and violent,--bold in the conception of a project,\r\ninflexible in its pursuit, persevering and dauntless in its execution.\r\nThese are the temperaments that have urged men both to noble and to\r\nexecrable deeds. Such were Alexander, Brutus, Mahomet, Cromwell, Charles\r\nthe Twelfth, Robespierre, Napoleon. All these celebrated characters\r\nevinced from their earliest youth the ambitious nature of their\r\ndispositions; and though circumstances might have checked the development\r\nof their predominant passions, it was also to adventitious circumstances\r\nthat they owed their elevation, and the opportunities of displaying their\r\ngood or evil qualities. Most of these men were irascible, vindictive, and\r\ncruel, and equally susceptible of ardent love and mortal hate. In these\r\ntemperaments we find a mixed exuberance of blood and bile in a constant\r\nstruggle for predominance.\r\n\r\nThe _melancholy_ or _atrabilious_ temperament is of a different character.\r\nHere the biliary organs are brought into a constant and a morbid action,\r\nwhile the sanguineous system is weak and irregular. In these gloomy\r\nsubjects the skin assumes a sallow, unearthly tinge, the pulse is hard and\r\ncontracted, the digestive functions torpid and irregular, the imagination\r\nis gloomy and full of suspicion, and a dark gloom is shed on all around\r\nthe morbid sufferer, for such he may be called, since the condition under\r\nwhich he labours may be considered one of disease. These subjects are\r\nprone to various monomanias; uncertain, fickle, and oftentimes\r\ncapriciously cruel. Tiberius and Louis the Eleventh are quoted as examples\r\nof this temperament. Many melancholic individuals have displayed great\r\ngenius, and at the same time great depth of thought. Richerand considers\r\nTasso, Pascal, Zimmermann, and Rousseau as illustrating this unhappy\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\nThe fourth temperament is the _phlegmatic_, _lymphatic_, _pituitous_, or\r\n_watery_, for all these terms used by different physiologists are\r\nsynonymous. Here the proportion of fluids is too considerable for that of\r\nthe solids; hence the body attains a considerable, unwholesome bulk. The\r\nmuscles are soft and flaccid, the skin fair and transparent, the hair\r\nflaxen or sandy, the pulse weak and slow, all the vital actions are\r\nlanguid, the memory little tenacious, and the attention wavering; an\r\ninsurmountable indolence prevails; and, averse to mental and corporeal\r\nexercise, the _far niente_ is their greatest enjoyment, and a nightcap is\r\npreferable to a diadem. These subjects are generally good, easy persons;\r\nsusceptible of kindly feelings, but of a transient nature. Their mind is\r\ngenerally depraved by effeminacy, and their love is purely animal. They\r\nare not courageous; yet they show great tranquillity of mind in moments of\r\ndanger, and would rather quietly sink than struggle with the waves. If\r\ntheir dwelling was on fire, they would calmly walk out of it, but not\r\nexert themselves to put down the conflagration; and, when hereditary power\r\nplaces them at the helm of a state, a wreck of the vessel may be speedily\r\nexpected, unless the sceptre is wrested from their feeble hands by the\r\ncholeric or the atrabilious enthusiast.\r\n\r\nThe fifth, or _nervous_ temperament, as I have already stated, may be\r\nconsidered of a complex nature, as it influences the sanguineous as well\r\nas the choleric, the melancholy, and the phlegmatic. In this constitution\r\nthe sentient system predominates, and there exists a great susceptibility\r\nto all external impressions. This temperament is generally acquired, and\r\nproceeds from a sedentary life, too great an enjoyment of sensual\r\npleasures, and fanciful ideas brought on by romantic readings and romantic\r\nthoughts indulged in hours of idleness. The determination of such\r\nindividuals is prompt, but uncertain; their affections warm for a while,\r\nare selfish and fickle; their sensations are vivid, but leave no\r\nimpressions. Women, especially when educated in boarding-schools,\r\nessentially belong to this class, and are subject to hysterical and\r\nconvulsive affections that render them a plague to others and a nuisance\r\nto themselves. In man the muscles are small, flabby, and wasted. The\r\nnervous may possess much vivacity of conception, but no depth of judgment;\r\nand, in general, their productions are as morbid as their mind. This\r\ncondition frequently attends the melancholy temperament, \"that wings the\r\nsoul, and points her to the skies.\"\r\n\r\nNervous excitability seldom prevails in the sanguineous constitution,\r\nwhere muscular masses are pronounced in athletic forms. Hence the\r\nsanguineous are not easily brought into action; but, when once roused,\r\ntheir energies are irresistible. This power is beautifully described by\r\nVirgil in the conflict between Entellus and Dares; still are these\r\nexertions governed by nervous influence, and the result of the\r\nexcitability and contractibility of the muscular fibre, termed by\r\nChaussier its _myotility_.\r\n\r\nMason Good has very justly observed that these temperaments, or generic\r\nconstitutions, are perpetually running into each other, and consequently\r\nthat not one of them, perhaps, is to be found in a state of full\r\nperfection in any individual; he further aids this remark by the\r\nfollowing illustration: \"Strictly speaking, Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox belonged\r\nequally, in the main, to the second temperament; there was the same\r\nardour, genius and comprehensive judgment in both, with a considerable\r\ntendency to the sanguineous, and hence with more irritability, but more\r\nself-confidence, audacity, and sanguine expectation: the latter, while\r\npossessing the same general or bilious temperament, was at the same time\r\nmore strongly inclined to the lymphatic, and hence his increased corporeal\r\nbulk, and with less bold and ardent expectation he possessed one of the\r\nsweetest and most benevolent dispositions to be met with in the history of\r\nthe world. The first was formed to be revered, the second to be beloved;\r\nboth to be admired and immortalized.\"\r\n\r\nI apprehend that a profound study of human temperaments and propensities\r\nmay afford a more desirable guide in the education of youth, and the\r\nselection of men in the different concerns of life, than that of either\r\nphysiognomy or phrenology; although the temperament must materially affect\r\nthe general character of the countenance. Yet, from the apparent\r\nprevalence of any temperament we are not to form a rash and hasty judgment\r\nin regard to the future capacities or propensities of youth. As one\r\ntemperament runs into another, and assumes a complex form, so can\r\neducation regulate the one that naturally predominates, and modify it by a\r\nfusion with another. Thus, the restlessness of the bilious and choleric\r\nmay be attuned to a phlegmatic state by the power of reason, and the brute\r\ncourage and audacity of the sanguineous checked by inspiring sentiments of\r\ntrue valour. That every temperament, excepting perhaps the phlegmatic, is\r\ncapable of displaying bravery, has been well described by Joanna Baillie\r\nin the following lines:\r\n\r\n  The brave man is not he who feels no fear,\r\n  For that were stupid and irrational;\r\n  But he whose noble soul its fear subdues,\r\n  And bravely dares the danger nature shrinks from.\r\n  As for your youth, whom blood and blows delight,\r\n  Away with them!--there is not in their crew\r\n  One valiant spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOLAR INFLUENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile both ancient and modern physiologists were of opinion that the\r\nvarious phenomena of organized bodies were influenced by lunar phases, the\r\npower of the solar rays was not less active in regulating our functions\r\nboth in health and in disease. The name of Phoebus signified the torch\r\nof life, and Apollo was the father of medicine and the fine arts. The sun\r\nwas considered as a deity in most countries, the Supreme Being,--the\r\nfather of light, Diespiter,--Jupiter, Jehovah, the creator of all living\r\nmatter,--the residence of the Most High--_In sole posuit tabernaculum\r\nsuum_, said the Psalmist;--and in Egypt three hundred and sixty-five\r\npriests were ordained to watch its heavenly movements during the year,\r\nwhile many philosophers attributed the propagation of the human race to\r\nthe union of man with the orb of day. The disciples of Plato and\r\nPythagoras considered it as possessing a soul; and Origenus, in his\r\nPeriarchon, maintained that it displayed both virtues and vices,--an\r\nheretical doctrine very properly condemned by the second Synod of\r\nConstantinople; and, although St. Augustin was of that opinion, it was\r\nwarmly combated by St. Basil and St. Ambrose, and many other beatified\r\ndivines. Anaxagoras, on the contrary, considered this luminary to be a\r\nburning stone; Plato called it a compact fire; Aristotle maintained that\r\nit was formed of one-fifth of the elements that constitute the planets;\r\nEpicurus, a mass of lava, or ignited pumice-stone; Xenophon asserted that\r\nit was fed by exhalations, and Zeno by watery vapours; Empedocles\r\nconsidered it a translucent body; Philolaus, a concave mirror,\r\nconcentrating the rays of light from every part of the universe to reflect\r\nit upon nature. Kepler was of a similar opinion, and further insisted that\r\nthe sun was composed of a limpid fluid upon which a luminous aether was\r\nreflected, whence its centre was blue, while the limbs were yellow. A\r\nmodern philosopher, Woodward, attempts to show that the sun and fixed\r\nstars are masses of electric fluid, requiring no alimentation, yielding no\r\nsmoke, and the light that emanates from them offers the bluish brilliancy\r\nof the electric spark. It has been justly observed, that if, like Eudoxus,\r\nwe endeavoured to approach this luminary, the better to study and\r\ndescribe its nature, we should still remain in impenetrable darkness,--in\r\nwhich I must leave the matter, to confine myself to those influences which\r\nexperience seems to show that the sun actually exercises on the animal\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nThe genial and invigorating glow that moderate solar heat produces has\r\never been considered as tending to prolong our life. Hippocrates observed,\r\nthat old men are double their age in winter, and younger in summer. To\r\nenjoy this reviving influence, the ancients had terraces on their\r\nhouse-tops called _solaria_, in which, to use their own expression, they\r\ntook a solar air-bath. Pliny the younger, in speaking of his uncle, tells\r\nus, _Post cibum, aestate, si quid otii, jacebat in sole_. The ancients\r\nfancied that when the sun rose diseases declined, and _Levato sole levatur\r\nmorbus_ became a medical axiom. Aristotle records the case of an innkeeper\r\nof Tarentum, who, although able to attend to his business by day, became\r\ninsane so soon as the sun had set. The moderns relate many similar\r\ninstances of derangement brought on by the absence of solar influence.\r\nBouillon mentions a woman who lost her senses at sunset, but who recovered\r\nthem at break of day. Other cases are recorded of a different nature, when\r\nmaladies were aggravated by this influence. Sauvage tells us of a woman\r\nwho became maniacal whenever the sun was at its zenith; an influence that\r\ncould not be prevented even by various stratagems, such as keeping her in\r\na dark room, and deceiving her in regard to the hour. Humboldt knew a\r\nSpanish lady in Madrid who lost her voice the moment the sun dipped in the\r\nhorizon, but the paralysis of the nerves of the tongue ceased the\r\nfollowing morning. A removal to Naples cured this singular affection.\r\nParham relates the cases of several individuals who were deprived of\r\nvision when the sun had set. In a former paper I have alluded to the\r\neffects of a vivid flood of light upon the Italian peasantry, as observed\r\nby Ramazzini. Daily practice shows us that the paroxysms of fever and\r\nvarious maladies are under a similar influence; and the evening gun in our\r\ngarrisons is often the signal of severe exacerbation in certain febrile\r\ncases, while the _reveillee_ develops acute aggravation in others.\r\nSydenham and Floyer had observed that the gout and asthma were usually\r\nushered in after our first sleep; and I have noticed that, during the\r\nprevalence of the cholera, the invasion of this fatal disorder generally\r\noccurred towards daybreak. The ancients divided their elementary\r\npredominance according to the diurnal cycle: thus, morning regulated the\r\nblood, noon the bile, evening the atrabile, and night the cold phlegmatic\r\ninfluence. Nor was this arrangement unnatural; we more or less observe it\r\nin a state of health, when man awakes refreshed and active at morn;\r\ntowards noon his train of thoughts becomes more serious and busy; in the\r\nevening his mind is more gloomy and susceptible of unpleasant impressions;\r\nuntil night either sheds its poppies o'er his couch, or agitates his frame\r\nwith its fearful dreams. The repose of night is ever more refreshing than\r\nthat of day, however we may have changed the natural applications of our\r\nhours, and find, as Seneca said of Roman civilization, that _antipodes\r\nhabemus in urbe_. The influence of night and day is equally observable in\r\nanimals. Towards evening myriads of insects, who had shunned the solar\r\nheat, hum around us; while night calls forth its choristers; and as they\r\ncease to sing other creatures proclaim the dawn. Some animals, such as the\r\n_simia beelzebud_, and the _simia seniculus_, salute both the setting and\r\nthe rising sun with fearful howls; and it may be considered as a law of\r\nnature, that we cannot turn night into day with impunity.\r\n\r\nDr. Balfour's opinion on the influence of the heavenly bodies is of great\r\nweight: he conceives that the influence of the sun and moon when in a\r\nstate of conjunction, which he names solar-lunar influence, produces\r\nparoxysms or exacerbations in continued fever, in all cases at least where\r\nparoxysms are observable. As this influence declines in consequence of the\r\ngradual separation of these luminaries from each other, and their getting\r\ninto a state of opposition, a way is left open for a critical and\r\nbeneficial change; in other words, that paroxysms and exacerbations in\r\nfever may be expected to take place at spring-tides, and crises at\r\nneap-tides.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed in intermitting fevers, that paroxysms of the\r\nquotidian recur in the morning, the tertian at noon, and the quartan in\r\nthe afternoon; in no instance do they take place at night.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that lunation, more especially in tropical climes,\r\ninfluences diseases; but the effects of insolation are every where\r\nobservable. One of the most serious accidents resulting from this exposure\r\nis the _ictus solis_, the _coup de soleil_ of the French, and the [Greek:\r\nsiriasis] of the Greeks, from the star _Sirius_, to whose influence they\r\nattributed the scorching heat of the dog-days. This attack is in general\r\nsudden, and the patient falls down as if struck with a blow on the head.\r\nTroops on a march, and labourers in the field, frequently are the victims\r\nof this solar power, which usually kills them on the spot. It has been\r\nknown to destroy great numbers. In Pekin, from the 14th of July to the\r\n25th, in the year 1743, it is related that eleven thousand persons were\r\nstruck dead. On a hot day's march in Portugal, I lost six men in a brigade\r\nunder my charge. They first reeled as if under the influence of liquor,\r\nand then fell dead with a slight convulsive struggle. One of them, the\r\nbatman of the paymaster of the 3rd foot, or Buffs, was struck dead while\r\nspeaking to me. A great number of greyhounds perished on the same march;\r\nbut no other species of dog seemed to suffer, although we had many\r\npointers and spaniels with us. Horses, mules, and cattle were also exempt\r\nfrom the attack, though it proved fatal to some weak donkeys who were\r\nfollowing the troops. The shakos worn by our army are well calculated to\r\npreserve the soldier from these accidents, to which troops are constantly\r\nexposed during summer operations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEATING FEVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis disastrous pestilence, which proved, if possible, more fatal and\r\nterrific than the cholera, made its first appearance in London, in 1480 or\r\n1483, first showing itself in the army of Henry VII. on his landing at\r\nMilford Haven. In London it only broke out a year or two after, and\r\nvisited that capital occasionally for upwards of forty years. It then\r\nspread to Holland, Germany, Belgium, Flanders, France, Denmark, and\r\nNorway, where it continued its ravages from 1525 to 1530; it then returned\r\nto England, and was observed for the last time in 1551.\r\n\r\nDr. Caius calls it a pestilential fever of one day; and it prevailed, he\r\nsays, with a mighty slaughter, and the description of it was as tremendous\r\nas that of the plague of Athens. Dr. Willis states that its malignity was\r\nso extreme, that as soon as it entered a city it made a daily attack on\r\nfive or six hundred persons, of whom scarcely one in a hundred recovered.\r\nThis malignant fever ran its course in a single paroxysm; and the cold fit\r\nand hot fit were equally fatal. If the patient was fortunate enough to\r\nreach the sweating stage, he was in general saved. It commenced its attack\r\nwith a pain in the muscles of the neck, shoulders, legs, and arms, through\r\nwhich a warm aura seemed to creep; after these symptoms a profuse\r\nperspiration broke forth. The internal organs grew gradually hot and\r\nburning, the pungent heat extending to the extremities; with an\r\nintolerable thirst, sickness soon followed by jactitation, coma, and\r\ndelirium. At Shrewsbury it raged for seven months, and carried off upwards\r\nof one thousand patients. The invasion of this terrific disorder was\r\ngenerally preceded by a thick noisome fog, especially in Shropshire. A\r\ndark cloud usually took the lead, and the distemper followed its course.\r\nIt is somewhat singular, but most fatal contagions have been ushered in,\r\nboth in ancient and modern times, by noxious fogs or mists, with clouds of\r\nvarious insects, either bending their course in innumerable bodies,\r\ncovering vegetation, or falling in dead heaps upon the ground. The disease\r\nwas generally supposed to arise from inclement seasons and injured grain;\r\nparticularly wheat infested with the mildew or smut, or rye attacked with\r\nthe spur. It was observed by Dr. Willan, that the contemporary inhabitants\r\nof Scotland and Wales, who fed on barley and oats, were not affected.\r\n\r\nOne of the most singular features of this malady was its only attacking\r\nthe English. Foreigners, and even the Scotch and Irish, in England, seemed\r\nto be exempted from this scourge, which attacked the monarch himself, and\r\ntwo Dukes of Suffolk, who sunk under its virulence. In Westminster the\r\nnumber of daily deaths averaged one hundred and twenty. It may be easily\r\nimagined that this special liability of Englishmen to contract the disease\r\nwas attributed to Divine wrath for their manifold offences; and we find\r\nthe following lines in Phemtophius:\r\n\r\n                  Coelestia numina nobis\r\n  Nil sunt quam nugae, fabula, verba, jocus:\r\n  Inde fames nobis, pestes, Mars; denique fontem\r\n  Hinc etiam inclemens [Greek: idoonretos] habet,\r\n  Saevum, horrendum, atrox genus immedicabile morbi,\r\n  Nostrae perfidiae debitum.\r\n\r\nDr. Armstrong has also recorded this peculiar visitation in the following:\r\n\r\n  Some, sad at home, and, in the desert, some,\r\n  Abjur'd the fatal commerce of mankind.\r\n  In vain: where'er they fled, the Fates pursued.\r\n  Others, with hopes more specious, cross'd the main,\r\n  To seek protection in far distant skies;\r\n  But none they found. It seemed, the general air\r\n  From pole to pole, from Atlas to the East,\r\n  Was then at enmity with English blood;\r\n  For, but the race of England, all were safe\r\n  In foreign climes; nor did this Fury taste\r\n  The foreign blood which England then contained.\r\n\r\nThat the atmosphere was saturated by this disease was obvious from the\r\ncircumstance of vast numbers of birds falling dead, when, upon\r\nexamination, pestilential swellings were found under their wings. Schiller\r\nattributed the disease to sideral influence. England, however, was not the\r\nonly country where the wrath of Heaven was considered as having fulminated\r\nthis scourge! and at Marburg it had such an effect, that it actually put\r\nan end to the violent disputes between Luther and Zuingle concerning the\r\nEucharist, and which were on the eve of kindling a religious war.\r\n\r\nA disease somewhat similar manifested itself in Picardy in 1773, having\r\nfirst appeared at Hardivilliers, five leagues from Beauvais; but, instead\r\nof terminating in a single day, it ran on to the third, fifth, and\r\nseventh: a fever of the same description was also observed in Gascony.\r\n\r\nBut of all the maladies that affect cutaneous transpiration, _diapedesis_,\r\nor sweating of blood, is the most singular; so much so, indeed, that its\r\nexistence has been doubted, although several well authenticated cases are\r\non record, both in the ancient and modern annals of medicine. It is\r\nmentioned by Theophrastus and Aristotle, while Lucan thus describes it:\r\n\r\n                        Sic omnia membra\r\n  Emisere simul rutilum pro sanguine virus.\r\n  Sanguis erant lacrymae; quacumque foramina novit\r\n  Humor, ab his largus manat cruor: ora redundant,\r\n  Et patulae nares; sudor rubet; omnia plenis\r\n  Membra fluunt venis: totum est pro vulnere corpus.\r\n\r\nThe detestable Charles IX. of France sunk under this disorder, thus\r\ndescribed by Mezeray: \"La nature fit d'etranges efforts pendant les deux\r\ndernieres semaines de la vie de ce Roi. Il s'agitait et se remuait sans\r\ncesse; le sang lui rejalliait par les pores et par tous les conduits de\r\nson corps. Apres avoir longtems souffert, il tomba dans une extreme\r\nfaiblesse et rendit l'ame.\" The same historian relates the case of a\r\ngovernor of a town taken by storm, who was condemned to die, but was\r\nseized with a profuse sweating of blood the moment he beheld the scaffold.\r\nLombard mentions a general who was affected in a similar manner on losing\r\na battle. The same writer tells us of a nun who was so terrified when\r\nfalling into the hands of a ruthless banditti, that blood oozed from every\r\npore. Henry ab Heer records the case of a man who not only laboured under\r\ndiapedesis, but small worms accompanied the bloody secretion.\r\n\r\nIn the Memoirs of the Society of Arts of Haarlem, we read of the case of a\r\nsailor, who, falling down during a storm, was raised from the deck\r\nstreaming with blood. At first it was supposed that he had been wounded,\r\nbut, on close examination, the blood was found to flow from the surface of\r\nthe body. Fabricius de Hilden mentions a case that came under the\r\nobservation of his friend Sporlinus, a physician of Bale; the patient was\r\na child of twelve years of age, who never drank any thing but water:\r\nhaving gone out into the fields to bring home his father's flocks, he\r\nstopped upon the road, and contrary to habit, drank freely of white wine.\r\nHe shortly after was seized with fever. His gums first began to bleed, and\r\nsoon after an haemorrhage broke out from every part of the integuments, and\r\nfrom the nose. On the eighth day of the malady he was in a state of\r\nextreme debility, and the body was covered with livid and purple spots,\r\nwhile every part from whence the blood had exuded was stopped with clots.\r\nA case is also related of a widow of forty-five years of age, who had lost\r\nher only son. She one day fancied that she beheld his apparition\r\nbeseeching her to relieve him from purgatory by her prayers, and by\r\nfasting every Friday. The following Friday, in the month of August, a\r\nperspiration tinged with blood broke out. For five successive Fridays the\r\nsame phenomenon appeared, when a confirmed diapedesis appeared. The blood\r\nescaped from the upper part of the body, the back of the head, the\r\ntemples, the eyes, nose, the breast, and the tips of the fingers. The\r\ndisorder disappeared spontaneously on Friday the 8th of March of the\r\nfollowing year. This affection was evidently occasioned by superstitious\r\nfears; and this appears the more probable from the periodicity of the\r\nattacks. The first invasion of the disease might have been purely\r\naccidental; but the regularity of its subsequent appearance on the stated\r\nday of the vision may be attributed to the influence of apprehension.\r\nBartholinus mentions cases of bloody sweat taking place during vehement\r\nterror and the agonies of torture.\r\n\r\nThe case of Catherine Merlin, of Chamberg, is well authenticated, and\r\nworthy of being recorded. She was a woman of forty-six years of age,\r\nstrong and hale. She received a kick from a bullock in the epigastric\r\nregion, that was followed by vomiting of blood: this discharge having been\r\nsuddenly stopped by her medical attendants, the blood made its way through\r\nthe pores of various parts of her body, every limb being affected in turn.\r\nThe sanguineous discharge was invariably preceded by a prickly and itching\r\nsensation; frequently this itching exudation proceeded from the scalp.\r\nThe discharge usually occurred twice in the twenty-four hours; and on\r\npressing the skin, the flow of blood could be accelerated and increased.\r\n\r\nDr. Fournier relates the case of a magistrate who was attacked with\r\ndiapedesis after any excitement, whether of a pleasurable or a painful\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nA singular idiosyncrasy was transmitted to her male children by an\r\nAmerican Female named Smith, occasioning a severe haemorrhage wherever the\r\nskin was slightly pricked or scratched. This loss of blood would sometimes\r\ncontinue for several days. Several of her sons sunk under the affection,\r\nwhich was found at last to yield to the sulphate of soda. What is most\r\nsingular, all her daughters were exempted from this fearful\r\npredisposition.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that this strange disorder arises from a violent commotion\r\nof the nervous system, turning the streams of blood out of their natural\r\ncourse, and forcing the red particles into the cutaneous excretories. A\r\nmere relaxation of the fibres could not produce so powerful a revulsion.\r\nIt may also arise in cases of extreme debility in connexion with a thinner\r\ncondition of the blood.\r\n\r\nCurious cases are recorded of a sandy sweat, in which the perspiration\r\nbecomes crystallized on the surface of the skin. Bartholinus, Schunig, and\r\nMollenbroek have related several cases of the kind. It is probable, as\r\nMason Good observes, that this morbid secretion may arise from an excess\r\nof uric acid, translated from the kidneys to the skin; this sand is\r\ngenerally of the same red colour as that of the renal secretions deposited\r\nin a lateritious sediment.\r\n\r\nScented perspiration is another singular peculiarity. This odour,\r\nfrequently unpleasant, has also been known to shed an agreeable aroma,\r\ncompared to the perfume of violets, roses, and musk. This quality is\r\ncommon in various animals; in the _Simia jacchus_, hedgehogs, hares,\r\nserpents, and crocodiles. The _Viverra zibetha_ and _V. civetta_ yield\r\nthis odour abundantly; and it has been observed in a faint degree in our\r\ndomestic cat. Many insects exhale an agreeable odour; especially the\r\n_Cerambix moschatus_, the _Apis fragrans_, the _Tipula mochifera_. The\r\n_Cerambix suaveolens_ emits a delicious smell of roses, and the Petiolated\r\nsphex a highly fragrant balsamic ether. In the Memoirs of the Queen of\r\nNavarre, we read that Catherine de Medicis was a perfect nosegay; and\r\nCujacius and Lord Herbert of Cherbury were equally distinguished by the\r\nsuavity of their transpiration.\r\n\r\nThe general perspiration of every man seems to be of a peculiar nature.\r\nSavages can distinguish their friends and foes by the scent. The boy born\r\ndeaf and dumb, whose history is related by Dugald Stewart, distinguished\r\npersons by their odour; and the dealers in hair can ascertain by the smell\r\nthe nation to which the hair belongs.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of perspiration secreted by a well-grown adult weighing about\r\none hundred and forty-six pounds, is at the rate of twenty-eight ounces in\r\nthe twenty-four hours, sixteen ounces during the period usually allotted\r\nto waking, and twelve ounces during sleep.[49] It is not so much increased\r\nby moderate elevation of temperature as might be imagined; it appears\r\nincreased after meals and during sleep. While the skin thus secretes so\r\nconsiderable a quantity of watery fluid, its powers of absorption are\r\nwonderful, and are frequently resorted to for medicinal purposes. This\r\nabsorption evidently tends to assist in repairing the strength. A boy at\r\nNewcastle who had been greatly reduced for a race, gained thirty ounces in\r\nweight in the course of an hour, during which time he had only taken a\r\nglass of wine. Dr. Home, after going to bed much fatigued and supperless,\r\ngained two ounces before the morning. Keill says that one night he gained\r\neighteen ounces in his sleep. Immersion in water and damp air materially\r\nincreases this power. Frogs, toads, even lizards, increase in weight\r\nalthough only partially dipped in water; and remarkably so if previously\r\ndeprived of part of their moisture by exposure to air. The power of\r\nabsorbing medicinal substances when immersed in their solution has been\r\ndemonstrated by Dr. Massy, an American physician, who found that if the\r\nbody was immersed in a decoction of madder,[50] this substance immediately\r\ntinged the renal secretion. Dr. Rousseau made a similar experiment with\r\nrhubarb. It is now clearly demonstrated that friction is not necessary to\r\nproduce absorption.\r\n\r\nThe keenness of the deaf and dumb boy in ascertaining the effluvium of\r\nvarious individuals, to which I have alluded, induces me to give a short\r\nsketch of this curious individual. His name was James Mitchell; and having\r\nno other source by which he could discover or keep up a connexion with\r\nsurrounding objects than those of smell, taste, and touch, he depended\r\nchiefly upon the first, like a domestic dog, in distinguishing persons\r\nand things. By this sense he identified his friends and relations; and\r\nconceived a sudden attachment or dislike to strangers. It was difficult,\r\nhowever, to ascertain at what distance he could thus exercise this\r\nfaculty; but, from Mr. Wardrop's observations, it appears that he\r\npossessed it at a considerable distance. This was particularly striking\r\nwhen a person entered the room, as he seemed to be aware of this before he\r\ncould derive any information from any sense than that of smell. When a\r\nstranger approached him, he eagerly began to touch some part of the body,\r\ncommonly taking hold of his arm, which he held near his nose; and, after\r\ntwo or three strong inspirations through the nostrils, he appeared to form\r\na decided opinion concerning him. If it were favourable, he showed a\r\ndisposition to become more intimate, examined more minutely his dress, and\r\nexpressed in his countenance more or less satisfaction; but if it happened\r\nto be unfavourable, he suddenly went off to a distance, with expressions\r\nof carelessness or disgust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSMALLPOX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first description we have of this dreadful disease is to be found in\r\nthe writings of Almansor of Rhazes, published about the end of the ninth\r\nor the beginning of the tenth century. He, however, quotes an Alexandrian\r\nphysician of the name of Aaron, who had treated the same subject so early\r\nas the year 622. There is no substantial ground to warrant a belief that\r\nit was known to the Greeks or Romans. The opinion of Hahn, who considered\r\nit to have been their anthrax, is absurd. Had this pestilence prevailed\r\namongst the ancients, and left the traces of its ravages,--which have\r\nmarked most fearfully so many individuals,--it is probable that these\r\nimpressions would have been attached to their names, as they were in the\r\nhabit of designating many of their illustrious personages by their\r\nphysical peculiarities, either natural or accidental. Hence we find\r\nOvidius _Naso_, Tullius _Cicero_, Horatius _Cocles_, Scipio _Nasica_,\r\nCurius _Dentatus_.\r\n\r\nThe term _variolae_, which this disease bears, was first applied to a\r\nmalady presenting the same symptoms, by Marius, bishop of Avanches, and\r\nappears to be derived from _varius_, spotted. Howbeit, to whatever region\r\nwe may be indebted for this scourge, it appears that it existed in Asia,\r\nand especially in China, long before its introduction into Europe. About\r\nthe middle of the sixth century, it was supposed to have been carried from\r\nIndia to Arabia by trading vessels, where no doubt the Arabian and\r\nSaracenic armies introduced it into the Levant, Spain, and Sicily. In 640,\r\nunder the caliphate of Omar, the Saracens spread the contagion over Syria,\r\nChaldaea, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Persia. Its appearance in Europe may be\r\nreferred to the eighth century. In the ninth century, as I have stated, we\r\nfind it described by the Arabian physicians. In the tenth century we find\r\nit described by other Arabian writers, chiefly Avicenna and Hali Abbas. In\r\n962, Count Baudouin of Flanders, died from its attack. It appears certain\r\nthat it prevailed in Gaul long before; we find in the works of Marius,\r\nalready mentioned, the following passage: \"Hoc anno (570) morbus validus,\r\ncum profluvio ventris et _variolis_, Italiam Galliamque valde afflixit.\"\r\nAbout the same period we find Dagobert and Clodobert, sons of Chilperic,\r\nfalling victims to the disorder; and Austregilda, wife of Gontran King of\r\nBurgundy, died of it in 580, at the age of thirty-two, so enraged with her\r\nphysicians, Nicholas and Donet, that she insisted that they should\r\naccompany her to the other world, to reward them for causing her untimely\r\nend. Her affectionate and disconsolate husband Gontran of course had both\r\ntheir throats cut upon her tomb.\r\n\r\nIn the eleventh and twelfth centuries we find the smallpox in all the\r\nsouthern parts of Europe. The north was for a long time tolerably exempted\r\nfrom the scourge, until the Holy War introduced it into those regions; and\r\nit appears to have been the only trophy that the English and Germans\r\nbrought home to commemorate their exploits in the Crusades.\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth century the Muscovites, Laplanders, and Norwegians were\r\nfree from the disorder, the progress of which seemed to have been delayed\r\nby the cold; although at the same time, according to the relation of\r\nGordon, it was most destructive all over France. Most physicians at this\r\nperiod partook of the opinion of the Arabians, who considered the disease\r\nas being in the blood, thrown by it into a state of ebullition,\r\nparticularly in childhood and youth. According to the Arabian Auaron, or\r\nAhron, it sometimes affected the same individual twice. This doctrine of\r\nthe boiling up and bubbling forth of the blood to throw out its peccant\r\nqualities, tended not a little to increase the mortality and exasperate\r\nthe disease; as the physicians, to encourage this concoction, were in the\r\nhabit of wrapping up their patients in warm clothing, and keeping their\r\napartments as hot as possible;--a fatal practice that subsequent\r\nexperience has rejected as destructive.\r\n\r\nIn 1517 the Spaniards carried it to St. Domingo, nearly depopulating the\r\ncountry. South America soon received this additional visitation, said to\r\nhave been carried amongst them by a negro. So terrific were the ravages of\r\nthis pestilence, that the Americans considered its invasion as one of the\r\n_data_ of their melancholy chronicles. The brother of the noble Montezuma\r\nwas one of its earliest victims; worthy attendant on the Spanish banners,\r\nit accompanied their detested hordes in all their conquests.\r\n\r\nThe northern districts of America were free from the contagion, when the\r\nEnglish carried it with their commercial productions amongst the natives\r\nof Boston in 1649, and subsequently to Virginia and Carolina, and the\r\nremaining provinces. The Spaniards infected Nootka Sound, and the Russians\r\ndesolated Kamtschatka about the same period.\r\n\r\nInoculation appears nearly as ancient as the disease, if we can credit the\r\nmissionaries, who were sent into China by the Church of Rome, and who,\r\nfrom their address and insinuation, gained access to the historical\r\nrecords: they have transmitted detailed accounts of the history of the\r\nChinese, and of their knowledge in various branches of science. There is a\r\nmemoir written on the smallpox by the missionaries at Pekin, the substance\r\nof which is extracted from Chinese medical books, and especially from a\r\nwork published by the Imperial College of Medicine, for the instruction of\r\nthe physicians of the empire. This book is entitled _Teou-tchin-fa_, or a\r\ntreatise from the heart to the smallpox; which states that the disease was\r\nunknown in the very early ages, and did not appear until the dynasty of\r\nTcheou, which was about 1122 years before Christ. The Chinese name for the\r\nmalady is a singular one, _Tai-tou_, or venom from the mother's breast;\r\nand a description is given of the fever, the eruption of the pustules,\r\ntheir increase, flattening, and crusting. In the same Chinese book there\r\nis also an account of a species of inoculation discovered seven centuries\r\npreviously; but, according to a tradition, it had been revealed in the\r\ndynasty of Long, that is, about 590 years before Christ. Father\r\nd'Entrecolles, the Jesuit, in his correspondence from China, gives some\r\ninformation respecting the smallpox, which confirms the material part of\r\nthe above information; for he notices having read some Chinese work which\r\nmentions the smallpox as a disease of the earliest ages. He also describes\r\na method of communicating the disease, which was called _sowing the\r\nsmallpox_; this was generally performed by planting some of the crusts\r\nupon the nose,--an operation which was approved of by some but disapproved\r\nby others.\r\n\r\nAlthough the tradition of the smallpox being a disease originally\r\ntransmitted to man by camels may be fanciful, yet the existence of the\r\nvaccine in cows might give some probability to its having been the case.\r\nMoore thus expresses himself on the subject: \"This notion probably took\r\nits rise from the circumstance that land commerce from Egypt to India was\r\nonly practicable by means of this animal. But such kind of traffic was\r\ntedious and difficult, and it is conjectured that no person known to have\r\nthe smallpox would ever have been suffered to join himself to a caravan.\"\r\nNow this observation would rather confirm the fact than invalidate it;\r\nsince, if no individual affected with the malady could have carried the\r\ncontagion, the disease might have been spread by their camels.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the antiquity of the practice of inoculation amongst the\r\nChinese, I cannot do better than give Mr. Moore's own words on so very\r\ninteresting a subject. \"No account is handed down of the origin of this\r\ncustom; but the reverence in which agriculture is held by the Chinese may\r\nhave suggested the name (sowing of the smallpox) and the usual manner of\r\nperforming the operation: for they took a few full dried smallpox crusts,\r\nas if they were seeds, and planted them in the nose; a bit of musk was\r\nadded in order to correct the virulence of the poison, and the whole was\r\nwrapped up in a bit of cotton to prevent it dropping from the nostrils.\r\nThe crusts employed were always taken from a healthy person who had had\r\nthe smallpox favourably; and, with the vain hope of mitigating their\r\nacrimony, they were sometimes kept in close jars for years, and at other\r\ntimes fumigated with salutary plants. Some physicians beat these crusts\r\ninto powder, and advised their patients to take a pinch of this snuff; and\r\nwhen they could not prevail upon them, they mixed it with water into a\r\npaste, and applied it in that form. In Hindostan, if tradition may be\r\nrelied upon, inoculation has been practised from remote antiquity. The\r\npractice was in the hands of a particular tribe of Brahmins, who were\r\ndelegated from various religious colleges, and who travelled through the\r\nprovinces for this purpose. The natives were strictly enjoined to abstain\r\nduring a preparatory month from milk and butter; and, when the Arabians\r\nand Portuguese appeared in that country, they were prohibited from taking\r\nanimal food also. These were commonly inoculated on the arm; but the\r\ngirls, not liking to have their arms disfigured, chose that it should be\r\ndone low on the shoulder: and whatever part was fixed upon was well rubbed\r\nwith a piece of cloth, which afterwards became a perquisite of the\r\nBrahmin. He then made a few slight scratches on the skin with a sharp\r\ninstrument, and took a bit of cotton, which had been soaked the preceding\r\nyear in variolous matter, moistened it with a drop or two of the holy\r\nwater of the Ganges, and bound it upon the punctures. During the whole of\r\nthis ceremony, the Brahmin always preserved a solemn countenance, and\r\nrecited the prayers appointed in the _Attharna Veda_, to propitiate the\r\ngoddess who superintended the smallpox. The Brahmin then gave his\r\ninstructions, which were regularly observed. In six hours the bandage was\r\nto be taken off, and the pledget allowed to drop spontaneously. Early next\r\nmorning, cold water was to be poured upon the patient's head and\r\nshoulders, and this was to be repeated until the fever came on. The\r\nablution was then to be omitted; but, as soon as the eruption appeared, it\r\nwas to be resumed and persevered in every morning and evening till the\r\ncrusts should fall off. Confinement to the house was absolutely forbidden;\r\nthe inoculated were to be freely exposed to every air that blew; but when\r\nthe fever was upon them, they were sometimes permitted to lie on a mat at\r\nthe door. Their regimen was to consist of the most refrigerating\r\nproductions of the climate; as plantains, water-melons, thin gruel made of\r\nrice or poppy-seeds, cold water, and rice.\"\r\n\r\nWhile sowing the disease was thus prevalent in some countries, selling and\r\nbuying it was adopted in others, when children bartered fruit in exchange\r\nfor the infection. It does not appear that the faculty took any notice of\r\ninoculation until the year 1703, when Dr. Emmanuel Timoni Alpeck wrote an\r\naccount of his observations in Constantinople, in a letter to Woodward: a\r\nVenetian physician, of the name of Pylamus, about the same time noticed\r\nthe success of the practice in Turkey. Lady Mary Wortley Montagu pursued\r\nthe inquiry in her voyage to that country, by causing her son Edward to be\r\ninoculated by Maitland, surgeon to the embassy, and, on her return to\r\nEngland in 1722, had the operation tried with successful results on her\r\ndaughter. Still, although two of the princesses of the royal family had\r\nalso been inoculated with equal benefit, inoculation was furiously opposed\r\nby the profession, and even from the pulpit; and so successful was this\r\nopposition, that it succeeded in bringing it into disuse both in England\r\nand throughout Europe, many cases of smallpox of a confluent character\r\nhaving made their appearance after inoculation, and in 1740 the practice\r\nhad nearly fallen into disuse. In this virulent controversy, a singular\r\ncircumstance was observed: while regular practitioners stated the practice\r\nto be unsuccessful, whenever it was adopted by quacks, monks, and old\r\nwomen, the result was invariably favourable; and the report that reached\r\nEurope of a Carmelite friar having inoculated thousands of Indians, an old\r\nwoman being equally fortunate in Greece, while at the same time a planter\r\nin St. Christopher's inoculated three hundred persons without the loss of\r\na single patient, the practice was again resumed, chiefly in our seaports,\r\nand gradually extended over the country. Mead materially assisted its\r\nprogress by stating that the Circassian ladies chiefly owed their beauty\r\nto this salutary preservative. In the year 1763, Daniel Sutton, son of a\r\nsurgeon in Suffolk, recommended the practice, modified, however, in the\r\ntreatment of the malady, and brought inoculation into general repute.\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that inoculation was by no means a novel introduction\r\neven in England, as it had been long practised in Pembrokeshire and\r\nseveral parts of Wales. On the Continent it had been tried at Cleves.\r\nBartholinus mentions it as adopted in Denmark; and traces of its adoption\r\nwere evident in Auvergne and Perigord.\r\n\r\nVarious modes of performing this operation were adopted. The Arabians\r\ninserted the virus with a pointed instrument between the thumb and the\r\nindex; the Georgians on the fore-arm; and the Armenians on the thigh. The\r\ntraveller Motraye mentions a Circassian old woman who used to inoculate\r\nwith three pins tied together. It appears that this practice was generally\r\nprevalent in Turkey in 1673. Trinoni and Pilarini observed that the\r\nnatural smallpox was generally fatal in Constantinople, while the disease\r\nproduced artificially was most benign. Bruce relates that from time\r\nimmemorial inoculation was practised in Nubia by old Negresses or Arabs.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, it was only in 1727 that inoculation became general in\r\nFrance; and its adoption was materially forwarded by Voltaire, who also\r\ntook special care to acquaint the fair sex that it was to this practice\r\nthat the Circassian and Georgian odalisks owed their beauty.\r\n\r\nThe terrific mortality that attended this disease was much increased by\r\nthe injudicious treatment to which patients were submitted. Instead of\r\nadopting the natural plan resorted to by eastern nations, and allowing\r\nthe patients a free current of air, with a refrigerant diet, cordials and\r\na hot regimen were enforced, under which the disorder soon assumed a\r\ndestructive malignity. Cold affusion, which has also been extolled by\r\nmodern physicians as a recent improvement in medical practice, we have\r\nseen, was also employed centuries ago. Sutton, who is generally, but\r\nerroneously, considered as being the introducer of inoculation, did\r\nnothing more, as I have already observed, than modify the treatment of the\r\ndisorder. Thus do we daily see impudence and quackery receiving rewards\r\nfor supposed discoveries, and the keepers of the public purse on such\r\noccasions seem much less careful of it than of their own. In our days, for\r\ninstance, chain-cables have been decreed a discovery, and their inventor\r\nentitled to a national recompence, whereas we read the following passage\r\nin Caesar's Commentaries, when speaking of the shipping of the\r\nGauls,--\"Anchorae, pro funibus, ferreis catenis revinctae:\" any schoolboy\r\ncould have given this information to our sapient legislators.\r\n\r\nThe reappearance or supposed increased prevalence of the smallpox after\r\nvaccination, for the last few years, may call for some observation. Ever\r\nsince the year 1804 a belief was entertained by many persons that the\r\ncowpox only afforded a temporary security. This doubt, however, never did\r\nrest upon any solid foundation. Dr. Jenner maintained in the most\r\nstrenuous manner, that to render the cowpox efficient, it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to attend most carefully to the character of the pustule, and\r\nthe time and quality of the lymph taken from it; on the very same\r\nprinciple inoculation of the smallpox also failed. For it must be clearly\r\nunderstood, that Jenner considered the smallpox and the cowpox as identic\r\nmaladies, and by no means dissimilar in their nature: on this important\r\nsubject I feel much gratification in quoting a passage from a late\r\nvaluable publication,[51] to which I refer the reader. \"It was then\r\nclearly ascertained, that there were deviations from the usual course of\r\nsmallpox, which were quite as common and infinitely more disastrous than\r\nthose which took place in vaccination. These deviations regarded two\r\napparently different states of the constitution. In the one the\r\nsusceptibility of smallpox, was not taken away by previous infection,\r\nwhile, on the other hand some constitutions seem to be unsusceptible of\r\nsmallpox infection altogether. It was found, that similar occurrences\r\ntook place in the practice of vaccination, but as the security which the\r\nlatter afforded was never more likely to be interfered with by slight\r\ncauses than the former, it became absolutely necessary that great care\r\nshould be shown in watching the progress and character of the pustule. Dr.\r\nJenner had from the beginning felt the propriety of this watchfulness; and\r\nhad distinctly announced that it was possible to propagate an infection by\r\ninoculation conveying different degrees of security, according as that\r\naffection approached to or receded from the full and perfect standard. He\r\nalso clearly stated that the cause of the vaccine pustule might be so\r\nmodified as to deprive it of its efficacy. That inoculation from such a\r\nsource might communicate an inefficient protection, and that all those who\r\nwere thus vaccinated were more or less liable to the subsequent smallpox.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Bacon is of opinion that the cowpox is now what it was at the\r\nbeginning. There are instances, in which it has passed from one human\r\nsubject to another for more than thirty years, consequently through\r\nfifteen or sixteen hundred individuals, but yet in which no degeneration\r\nhas taken place. He nevertheless admits that recent lymph from the cow\r\nshould be preferred, when it can be procured; he is further of opinion\r\nthat the occurrence of smallpox after inoculation does not exceed in\r\nnumber the cases of smallpox after smallpox. My own experience confirms\r\nthese views. I was in practice in Bordeaux during the prevalence of what\r\nis called smallpox in vaccinated cases,--the cases were rare, doubtful,\r\nand very seldom fatal.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the smallpox would sweep away thousands of our\r\ndense population but for the protecting power of vaccination, the failure\r\nof which, ought more frequently to be attributed to the vaccinator, or the\r\nconstitution of the patient, than to Jenner's immortal discovery. Dr.\r\nSevern has just published an essay on this most important subject, and it\r\nappears by his statistical tables, that such has been the decrease of\r\nmortality since the introduction of vaccination, that the number of\r\npatients admitted into the smallpox hospital from 1775 to 1800,--were\r\n7017--the deaths 2277--whereas from the year 1800 to the year 1825, the\r\nnumber admitted was 3943, and the deaths 1118--not half the number,\r\nalthough the population of London had doubled during that period. Dr.\r\nSevern further calculates that the proportion of failures is 6 in 3000.\r\n\r\nWe read with feelings of deep regret in his late bibliography, that the\r\nman at whose intercession the magic of his name obtained the liberation of\r\nNapoleon's prisoners, could not obtain an appointment for the members of\r\nhis own family from the British Government; nay, the College of Physicians\r\ndespite the exertions of Dr. Baillie, refused to admit him to a fellowship\r\nin their learned body. It was when reflecting on such national\r\ningratitude, that he wrote to a friend, \"Never aim, my friend at being a\r\npublic character, if you love domestic peace.\" And not long before he\r\nterminated his invaluable career he made this remarkable expression: \"I am\r\nnot surprised that men are not thankful to me; but I wonder that they are\r\nnot grateful to God for the good which he has made me the instrument of\r\nconveying to my fellow-creatures.\"\r\n\r\nIt is in vain that France with her usual _jactance_ pretends that the\r\nfirst idea of vaccination arose in that country, they have no more claim\r\nto the discovery than their Marshals to Wellington's immortal glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERATIVE ANIMALCULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMicroscopic experiments daily demonstrate the existence of myriads of\r\nanimalcules in every substance. They have recently been discovered in the\r\nprogress of certain crystallizations; and some philosophers maintain that\r\nmost inorganic bodies are formed of the remains of organic substances. The\r\nexistence of animalcules in the generative secretion was first noticed by\r\nLewis Hamme, a young German student, and shown by him to Leeuwenhoeck, who\r\npublished an account of them. Hartzoeken wrote upon the subject the\r\nfollowing year, and asserted that he had seen these animalcules three\r\nyears before they had been observed by Hamme. This curious subject soon\r\nattracted the notice, not only of physiologists, but of priests, artists,\r\nand even courtiers, for we find our Charles II. making curious inquiries\r\non this investigation. Although many opticians could not discover these\r\ncreatures, the eyes of courtiers were more keen than theirs, and to\r\ngratify their royal master's depravity, described them most minutely.\r\nTheir length was 3/100000 of an inch, their bulk such as to admit the\r\nexistence of 216,000 in a sphere whose diameter was the breadth of a hair,\r\nand their rate of travelling nine inches in the hour. They saw them in\r\nthe seminal secretion of every animal; and, what was still more\r\nremarkable, they were of a similar size whatever might have been that of\r\nthe animal: they saw them in the sprat and in the whale; they could\r\ndistinguish the male from the female; and they all moved along in\r\ngregarious harmony like a flock of sheep: nay, more; Dalenpatius actually\r\nsaw one of them, more impatient than his companions, burst from his\r\nignoble shackles, and actually assume the human form. At other times they\r\nwere discovered swimming in shoals to given points, turning back,\r\nseparating, meeting again, and frisking about like golden fish in a pond.\r\nKauw, Boerhaave, Maupertius, Lieuland, Ledermuller, Monro, Nicholas,\r\nHaller, and indeed most of the philosophers of Europe, were convinced of\r\ntheir existence.\r\n\r\nBuffon, however, and other naturalists, contended that these were not\r\nanimalcules, but organic particles; and Linnaeus imagined them to be inert\r\nmolecules, thrown into agitation by the warmth of the fluid. Finally, to\r\ndetermine the question, Spallanzani began an assiduous course of\r\nobservations and experiments. He found these animalcules in the human\r\nspecies to be of an oval form, with a tail tapering to a point. This\r\nappendage, by moving from side to side, propelled them forward. They were\r\nin constant motion in every direction. In about twenty-three minutes their\r\nmovements became more languid, and in two or three hours they generally\r\ndied. The duration of their life, however seemed to depend, in a great\r\nmeasure, on the temperature of the medium: at 2 deg. (Reaumur) they died\r\nin three quarters of an hour; while at 7 deg. they lived two hours, and at\r\n12-1/2 deg. three hours and three quarters. If the cold was not too\r\nintense, they recovered upon the temperature being raised; when only 3 deg.\r\nor 4 deg., they recovered after a lethargy of fourteen hours; and according\r\nto the less intensity of the cold, they might be made to pass from the\r\ntorpid to the active state more frequently. They were destroyed by river,\r\nice, snow, and rain water; by sulphur, tobacco, camphor, and electricity;\r\neven the air was injurious to them: in close vessels their life was\r\nprolonged to some days, and their movements were not constant and hurried.\r\nThey were of various sizes, and perfectly distinct from all species of\r\nanimalcules found in vegetable infusions, &c. In short, Spallanzani\r\ncompletely confirmed the principal observations of Leeuwenhoeck, and\r\nsatisfactorily explained the sources of the inaccuracies of other\r\ninquirers. Prevost and Dumas have recently confirmed the observations of\r\nthe Italian physiologist.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of life being perpetuated by the transmission of animated\r\nparticles, or animalcules, is by no means of modern date. We find this\r\ntheory advanced by Hippocrates, and Aristotle, and Plato. Democritus\r\ndescribed worms that assumed, in the progress of their development, the\r\nhuman form; and Lactantius thus refuted his ideas: \"Erravit ergo\r\nDemocritus, qui vermiculorum modo putavit homines effusos esse de terra,\r\nnullo auctore, nullaque ratione.\" Hippocrates plainly says, that the\r\nseminal secretion was full of animalcules, whose several parts were\r\ndeveloped, and grew afresh; that nothing did exist that had not\r\npre-existed; and that what we term birth was nothing more than that\r\ntransition of these hitherto imperceptible animalcules from darkness to\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nGesner has endeavoured to prove that the word [Greek: psyche], so\r\nfrequently found in the writings of Hippocrates, and translated _anima_,\r\nwas synonymous with _insectum_, _animalculum_, _papilio_. Plato, when\r\nexpressing himself on this curious subject, compares the matrix to a\r\nfertile field, in which animalcules are gradually developed, at first of\r\nsuch a small size that they are imperceptible, but, by taking the food\r\nprepared for them, grow in strength until they are brought to light in a\r\nstate of perfect generation; and St. Augustine thus follows: \"Hunc\r\nperfectionis modum sic habent omnes ut cum illo concipiantur atque\r\nnascuntur; sed habent in ratione, non in mole, sicut ipsa jam membra omnia\r\nsunt latenter in semine; cum etiam natis nonnulla desint, sicut dentes, ac\r\nsi quid ejusmodi.\" In the works of Seneca we also find the same notions:\r\n\"In semine omnis futuri hominis ratio comprehensa est, et legem barbae et\r\ncanorum nondum natus infans habet; totius enim corporis, et sequentis\r\naetatis, in parvo occultoque lineamenta sunt.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be said that these opinions were similar to those of the\r\n_Ovarians_, who, as we have observed already, believed that every thing\r\narose from the egg. Such were Aristotle, Empedocles, and other\r\nphilosophers: \"For the egg is the conception,\" said the first of these\r\ngreat men, \"and after the same manner the animal is created;\" but there\r\nwas a manifest difference in their systems. Harvey, Haller, De Graef, were\r\namongst the most warm advocates of this doctrine, which indeed prevails to\r\nthe present day, as it would be difficult to find organized beings that\r\ndid not spring from an original germ.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that, notwithstanding the absurd doctrines of generation\r\nbeing founded upon the existence of these animalcules, they clearly do\r\nexist. Modern microscopic experiments daily confirm the fact; not only in\r\nthe generative secretion, but in the other fluids of the body: creatures\r\nof an inch to an inch and a quarter in length have been found to inhabit\r\nthe mesenteric arteries of asses and horses. Mr. Hodgson found them in\r\nseven asses out of nine. They have also been found in the blood of female\r\nfrogs, salamanders, and tadpoles. What wonders are perhaps in store for\r\nthe microscopic observer and the physiologist! All living matter seems to\r\nbe animated by particles, by atoms, equally possessed of life. Does the\r\nvitality of these constituent molecules hold any influence over our\r\nexistence? Is their life necessary to the preservation of ours? Is any\r\nagency destructive to them injurious or destructive to us? In a former\r\npaper I have recorded recent observations, where animalcules of a peculiar\r\ndescription were found in the purulent secretion attending various\r\naffections. A morbid condition seems thus to produce a new series of\r\nanimated beings, or this new series of living atoms perhaps have produced\r\na morbid state. Many eruptive maladies are either caused by the presence\r\nof insects, or insects are subsequently developed in their pustules.\r\nWichmann, and many other physicians, have maintained that the itch was\r\nproduced by an insect of the genus _acarus_, or _tick_.\r\n\r\nLatreille has given a minute description of this creature in his _Genera\r\ncrustaceorum et insectorum_, and calls this offensive species the\r\n_sarcoptes scabiei_. Linnaeus classed it among the _aptera_, and termed it\r\nthe _acarus scabiei_. This insect is nearly round, with eight legs; the\r\nfour fore-legs terminated with a small head, the hind ones with a silky\r\nfilament. The Arabian Avenzoar had long since observed them, and it was\r\nfrom his writings that Mouffet was induced to pursue the inquiry. Redi, an\r\nItalian physician, was the first propagator of this doctrine in modern\r\ntimes, and published, in 1685, a paper of Cestoni of Leghorn, who had\r\nfrequently observed mendicants and galley-slaves extracting these insects\r\nfrom the pustules of itch with the point of a pin, in the same manner as\r\n_chigoes_ are extracted from their cyst in the West Indies.\r\n\r\nIt was this communication of Cestoni that led to a further and more minute\r\ninvestigation. Curiosity was every where excited, and the most learned\r\nand intelligent naturalists and physicians, amongst whom we find the\r\nillustrious names of Borelli, Etmuller, Mead, Pringle, Pallas, Bonani,\r\nLinnaeus, Morgagni, strove with incessant diligence to ascertain this\r\nimportant fact, which certainly was likely to shed a new light on our\r\npathological speculations. The existence of the acarus was established.\r\n\r\nThe most conclusive experiments on the subject were those of Gales, in\r\n1812. The following is the account of them: \"I placed under a microscope a\r\nwatch-glass with a drop of distilled water, after having carefully\r\nascertained that it did not contain any visible animalcules. I then\r\nextracted from an itch pustule a small portion of the virus, which I\r\ndiluted in the water with the point of a lancet. I watched most\r\nattentively for upwards of ten minutes, without having been able to notice\r\nany animation. Two similar experiments were equally ineffectual.\r\nDisappointed in my expectations, I was about giving up the task, when an\r\nidea struck me of submitting the liquid of the first experiment to another\r\ntrial. I had left it in the watch-glass, exposed to solar heat. I then was\r\nnot a little surprised when I discovered a perfect insect struggling with\r\nits legs to extricate itself from the viscid fluid that confined it.\r\nHaving succeeded in reaching a more limpid part of the liquor, its form\r\nwas so distinct that Mr. Patrix, who was with me, was enabled to take an\r\nexact drawing of its configuration.\"\r\n\r\nThis curious result naturally induced Gales to pursue his inquiries, and\r\nhe discovered that this insect chiefly occupies the pustules that are\r\nfilled with a thin serum, and avoids those that contain a thicker\r\nsecretion. Hence the watery pimples in itch are invariably those that\r\nproduce the most intolerable prurience.\r\n\r\nThe next important question was to decide whether this insect was the\r\ncause of the disgusting disorder. For this purpose Gales placed several of\r\nthem on the back of his hand. He then covered the part with a small\r\nwatch-glass, kept in place with a bandage. Three hours after he awoke,\r\nexperiencing a sensation of itching on the part. The following morning\r\nthree itch pustules were evident, and convinced him that he had succeeded\r\nin inoculating himself with the loathsome complaint. This fact he\r\ncommunicated to Olivier, Dumeril, Latreille, and Richerand. Experiments in\r\nthe hospital were immediately directed to be made, and all produced a\r\nsimilar result; affording a convincing proof that these insects could\r\nproduce the affection, which they had merely been thought to have\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\nMany writers, who, like Mason Good, had decided that \"whenever these\r\ninsects appear, they are not a cause but a consequence of the disease,\"\r\nopposed and contradicted the statement of Gales, and the numerous\r\npractitioners who had procured and witnessed facts, which are never\r\n\"stubborn things\" to speculative minds. These writers maintained that\r\nwhenever any organ was weakened, or in a morbid condition, it was apt to\r\nbecome a nidus for some insects or worms to burrow in. Hence the numerous\r\nvarieties of invermination in debility of the digestive organs. But it is\r\nneedless to observe that their objections cannot stand against the\r\nimbodied evidence brought forward in proof of their error. Bosc, Huzard,\r\nLatreille, Dumeril, and many other naturalists, subsequently found these\r\nacari in the eruptive diseases of many animals.\r\n\r\nI repeat it, this subject is replete with interest; and microscopic\r\nexperiments may some time or other throw a material light on the practice\r\nof medicine. Those substances that are known to destroy the insect that\r\nproduces the itch, cure the malady. May not this analogy lead to singular\r\nresults?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe circulation of the blood was first taught by the unfortunate Servetus\r\nin 1553, who was burnt to death as a heretic; and, a century afterwards,\r\ndemonstrated by our Harvey, who is justly considered as having discovered\r\nthe wonderful mechanism of the motion of the vital fluid.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt, however, that the ancients had formed, if not a\r\ncorrect, at least an ingenious, idea of it. Hippocrates tells us \"that all\r\nthe veins communicate with each other, and flow from one vessel into\r\nothers; and that all the veins that are spread over the body carry a flux\r\nand movement originating in a single vessel.\" He avows that he is ignorant\r\nof the principle whence it arises, or of its termination, it appearing\r\nto be a circle without beginning or end. He further states, that the heart\r\nis the source of the arteries, through which blood is carried over the\r\nbody, communicating life and heat; and he adds, that they are so many\r\nrivulets that irrigate the system, and carry vitality into every part: the\r\nheart and veins are in constant motion; and he compares the circulation of\r\nblood to the course of rivers, that return to their source by\r\nextraordinary deviations. He therefore directs blood-letting to restore a\r\nfree current of the blood and other spirits in apoplexies and other\r\ndiseases of a similar nature, which he attributed to obstruction in the\r\nvessels intercepting the flow of their contents. He also observes, that\r\nwhen bile enters the blood, it deranges its consistence, and disturbs its\r\nordinary course towards another point: and he compares the circulation to\r\nballs of thread, the threads of which return to each other in a circuitous\r\nmanner, terminating at the point whence their motion arose.\r\n\r\nPlato thought that the heart was the source of the veins, and of the\r\nblood, that was rapidly borne to every part of the body. Aristotle tells\r\nus that the heart is the principle and source of the veins and of the\r\nblood. He considered that there were two veins proceeding from this organ,\r\none from the left side, the other from the right; the first he termed\r\n_aorta_: and he further maintained that the arteries communicated with the\r\nveins, with which they were intimately connected.\r\n\r\nJulius Pollux taught, in his _Gnomasticon_, that the arteries are the\r\nchannels through which the spirits circulate as the veins propel the\r\nblood; and he describes the heart as having two cavities, one\r\ncommunicating with the arteries, and the other with the veins. Apuleius\r\ntells his disciples that the heart propels the blood through the lungs, to\r\nbe afterwards distributed over the system.\r\n\r\nIn the writings of Nemesius, bishop of Emissa, we read that the movement\r\nobserved in the pulse originates in the heart, chiefly from the artery of\r\nthe left ventricle of the viscus. This artery is dilated, and then\r\ncontracted, by a constant and powerful harmonious action. When dilated the\r\nvessel draws towards it the most subtile portions of the neighbouring\r\nblood, and the vapour or exhalation of this fluid, that feeds the animal\r\nspirits; but when it contracts, it exhales, through various channels of\r\nthe body, all the vapours that it contains.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear, doubts were once entertained as to the actual\r\nsituation of the heart, whether it was lodged in the right or the left\r\nside of the body. The question was finally settled by a professor of\r\nHeidelberg, who for the purpose killed a pig in the presence of the\r\nMargrave of Baden, Durlach, who then laboured under a supposed disease of\r\nthat organ, which it was then clearly shown occupied the left side. The\r\nresult of this experiment, however proved somewhat detrimental to his\r\nHighness's physician, who was dismissed, although he maintained with all\r\nbecoming courtesy and respect, that the heart of his princely master could\r\nnot _possibly be_ in the same position as that of a hog.\r\n\r\nMichael Servetus, in his work, _De Christianismi restitutione_, also in\r\nthe 7th book, _De Trinitate Divina_, for which he was sentenced to the\r\nstake a very short time after its publication, gives us the following\r\ndescription of this important function: The blood, which is a vital\r\nspirit, is diffused all over the body by _anastomoses_, or inosculation of\r\ntwo vessels through their extremities. The air in the lungs contributes to\r\nthe elaboration of the blood, which it draws for that purpose from the\r\nright ventricle of the heart through the pulmonary artery. This blood is\r\nprepared in the lungs by a movement of the air that agitates it,\r\nsubtilizes it, and, finally, mingles it with that vital spirit which is\r\nafterwards retransmitted to the heart by the movement of the diastole, as\r\na vital fluid proper to maintain life. This communication and preparation\r\nof the blood, he further states, is rendered evident by the union of the\r\narteries and veins in this organ; and he concludes by affirming that the\r\nheart, having thus received the blood prepared by the lungs, transmits it\r\nthrough the artery of the left ventricle, or the aorta, to every part of\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\nGreat care was of course taken to destroy this abominable heretical\r\npublication, which was burnt by the common hangman in Geneva, Frankfort,\r\nand several provinces of France. The work thence became so scarce, that it\r\nis said only three or four copies of it are in existence. One of them was\r\nin the library of the Landgrave of Hesse-Cassel.\r\n\r\nJohn Leonicenus relates that the celebrated Paul Sarpi otherwise named Fra\r\nPaolo, had also discovered this circulation, and demonstrated the valves\r\nof the veins, which open to afford a free passage to the blood, and close\r\nto prevent its return. This discovery, it is pretended, was made known to\r\nFabricius ab Aquapendente, professor of medicine in Padua in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and successor of Fallopius, and who communicated the fact to\r\nHarvey, then a student in that university.\r\n\r\nSome time before Harvey's discovery, Cesalpinus had described with great\r\nprecision the pulmonary circulation; and, on finding that veins swelled\r\nunder a ligature, he attributed this enlargement to the warmth of the\r\nblood. This warmth, he says, proceeds from a spirit residing in the blood.\r\nThe left ventricle is filled with blood of a spirituous nature; and one\r\ncan trace the movement of the blood towards the superior parts, and its\r\nreturn (_retrocessus_) to the internal ones,--that is to say, a return by\r\nwhich it comes back from the extremities to the heart, when awake or\r\nsleeping, from every part of the body; for if you tie the vessels, or if\r\nthey are obstructed, the current of the blood is stopped, and then their\r\nsmaller ramifications tumefy towards their origin. The following are his\r\nwords: \"Sic non obscurus est ejusmodi motus in quacumque corporis parte,\r\nsi vinculum adhibeatur, aut alia ratione occludantur venae: cum enim\r\ntollitur permeatio, intumescunt rivuli qua parte fluere solent.\" From\r\nthese expressions it is clear that Cesalpinus suspected the great\r\ncirculation, and had a fair idea of its nature; yet there is no doubt but\r\nthat it was to our Harvey that the first demonstration of this wondrous\r\nfunction was reserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRUNKENNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt all periods this degrading vice appears to have been more or less\r\nprevalent. We find it frequently mentioned in the early history of the\r\nJews. Tacitus informs us that it was common amongst the ancient Germans;\r\nand in Greece and Rome it was not only common, but frequently extolled as\r\nbeneficial--as medicinal:\r\n\r\n  Si nocturna tibi noceat potatio vini,\r\n  Hora matutina rebibas, et erit medicina.\r\n\r\nSocrates considered the indulgence in wine pardonable. Thus, C. Gallus:\r\n\r\n  Hoc quoque virtutem quondam certamine, magnum\r\n  Socratem palmam promeruisse ferunt.\r\n\r\nAccording to Horace, Cato the Censor had often recourse to its\r\nexhilarating virtues:\r\n\r\n  Narratur et prisci Catonis\r\n  Saepe mero incaluisse virtus.\r\n\r\nSeneca informs us that even the Roman ladies frequently indulged in these\r\npotations. The drunkenness of the ancients bore all the disgusting\r\ncharacter of the present day, and was thus admirably described by\r\nLucretius:\r\n\r\n          Cum vini penetravit--\r\n  Consequitur gravitas membrorum, praepediuntur\r\n  Crura vacillanti, tardescit lingua, madet mens,\r\n  Nant oculi; clamor, singultus, jurgia gliscunt.\r\n\r\nHowever, from the language of the ancients, we cannot come to the\r\nconclusion that Socrates, and other great men who were accused of\r\ninebriety, were habitual drunkards, or even that, under the influence of\r\ntheir potations, they were occasionally deprived of their reason. On the\r\ncontrary, there is every reason to believe that the ancients both ate and\r\ndrank a great deal during their repasts; and thus mingling their wine and\r\ntheir food, like most of the continental nations, they were less subject\r\nto the inconveniences that arose from their indulgence in liquor. Indeed,\r\nthe term sobriety applies to a proper regulation of our ingesta, according\r\nto our constitution and our state of health. Extreme abstinence on some\r\noccasions may prove as prejudicial as intemperance; and there are peculiar\r\nidiosyncrasies where a certain quantity of stimulus is absolutely\r\nrequisite to keep up the animal spirits, and at the same time assist\r\nassimilations which become languid under mental depression. No doubt, this\r\nnecessity has arisen from habit,--most probably a very bad habit; still,\r\nwhen it does exist, physicians should be cautious in suddenly forbidding\r\ncustomary indulgences: we must also consider on such occasions the\r\npursuits of different individuals. The laborious classes, who require more\r\nfrequent refection, from the constant exhaustion to which their avocations\r\nexpose them, can bear with impunity a moderate use of strong liquors. Such\r\na practice would destroy the sedentary and the studious. Temperance is\r\nessentially requisite to perfect not only our intellectual faculties, but\r\nmany of our physical functions. The senses both of man and the brute\r\ncreation are rendered much more keen by abstinence. The scent of the dog,\r\nthe vision of the hawk, are less acute after feeding; and this is one of\r\nthe chief causes of the greater perspicuity in our ideas when fasting in\r\nthe morning. The ancients had an axiom founded upon observation, \"_if you\r\nwish to become robust, eat and labour; if you wish to become wise, fast\r\nand meditate_.\" The Greeks called sobriety, [Greek: sophrosune]; or,\r\naccording to Aristotle, as though they said, [Greek: sozousan ten\r\nphronesin], it assisted our intellectuals. Plato tells us that Socrates\r\ntermed this quality [Greek: soterian tes psroneseos], or the health of the\r\nmind. Xenophon maintained that it prevented men from spitting or blowing\r\ntheir noses, as we were not in need of superfluities when we decreased the\r\nconsumption of what was necessary. The ancients looked upon sobriety as a\r\nbent bow, that required occasional relaxation.\r\n\r\nIt is said, but I know not on what authority, that Hippocrates recommended\r\nan indulgence in potations once a month. Celsus recommends persons in\r\nperfect health not to be too rigorous in their diet; sometimes to fast,\r\nand at others to live more freely. In more modern times this supposed\r\nprecept of Hippocrates has been advocated, and we find two theses on the\r\nsubject, entitled \"_Non ergo singulis mensibus repetita ebrietas\r\nsalubris_,\" and \"_Non ergo unquam ebrietas salubris_,\" by Hammet and\r\nLanglois. Zacchias, in his medical questions, asks if a physician can\r\nrecommend such a departure from the laws of temperance without committing\r\na sin. This query has been also debated by divines. Frederick Hoffmann\r\nmaintained that poets required this indulgence, and attributes in a great\r\nmeasure the falling off of genius amongst the modern Greeks to the\r\ndestruction of their vineyards by the Turks. In ancient Iconography we\r\noftentimes find Bacchus placed near Minerva. The allusions of Heathen\r\nmythology to drunkenness, its effects, and the means of tempering its\r\ninfluence, are curious. Silenus, the preceptor of Bacchus, although\r\nrepresented as always intoxicated, was a philosopher, who accompanied his\r\npupil in his Indian expedition, and aided him by the soundness of his\r\njudgment. Virgil makes him deliver the principles of the epicurean\r\ndoctrines on the formation of the world, and the nature of things. Aelian\r\ngives us his conversation with Midas regarding the unknown world of Plato\r\nand other philosophers. He was also considered an able warrior and a wit.\r\nAelian derives his name from _Sillainein_. The nymphs who follow his train\r\nwere considered as typical of the water necessary to dilute his potations,\r\nand the influence of love in checking intemperance.\r\n\r\nMontaigne informs us that the celebrated Sylvius recommended an occasional\r\ndebauch; and the late Dr. Gregory was of opinion than an occasional excess\r\nis, upon the whole, less injurious to the constitution than the practice\r\nof daily taking a moderate quantity of any fermented liquor or spirit.\r\nExperience, however, does not uphold the doctor's opinion; and, as I have\r\nobserved in a preceding article, occasional excesses are far more\r\ninjurious than habitual indulgences, under which, in the most\r\nunfavourable climates, men attain advanced years. An occasional excess\r\nactually brings on a state of sickness, which, in persons habitually\r\nsober, may not only last for several days, incapacitating them from any\r\npursuit, but be frequently followed by serious accidents. Of course I am\r\nnot alluding to a constant state of intoxication, which will often bring\r\non delirium, tremor, apoplexy, and other destructive accidents.\r\n\r\nThe appearances after death in drunkards exhibit great derangement in\r\norganic structure. The brain is generally firmer than usual. Serum is not\r\nunfrequently found effused in its cavities; and, what is singular, this\r\nwatery fluid is often impregnated with the odour of the deceased's\r\npotations, such as rum, gin, or brandy. Schrader relates several instances\r\nof the kind. Aether has also been detected after the medicine had been\r\nfreely exhibited. Dr. Ogston states that above four ounces of fluid were\r\nfound in the ventricles of a drunkard's brain, that had all the physical\r\nqualities of alcohol. He thinks that this effusion takes place previously\r\nto the coma of intoxication, as he found it in considerable quantities in\r\ntwo cases of drowning in the stage of violent excitement from spirituous\r\nliquors. The mucous coats of the stomachs of drunkards, instead of being\r\n\"worn out,\" according to the vulgar expression, are thickened, and\r\nsometimes softened; but in most cases they are found hardened. This\r\ncondition is not likely to accelerate death; on the contrary, the stomach\r\nis less susceptible of the action of stimulating articles of diet, or\r\nexcess in eating or drinking, than when in a healthy state of\r\nexcitability. When drunkenness proves fatal, it appears that a portion of\r\nthe spirituous part of the liquor is actually absorbed and carried into\r\nthe circulation and the brain. Dr. Copeland has given the following very\r\nluminous and correct view of the pathology of drunkenness. \"During the\r\ngeneral nervous and vascular excitement consequent on the stimulus,\r\nincreased determination to the head takes place, attended by excited\r\nvascular action, which soon terminates in congestion as the excitement\r\nbecomes exhausted, and gives rise to drowsiness, sopor, and coma. With\r\nthis state of the disorder effusion of serum takes place in the ventricles\r\nand between the membranes, heightening the sopor and coma. When the\r\ncongestion or effusion amounts so high as to impede the functions of the\r\norgans at the basis of the encephalon and of the respiratory nerves,\r\nrespiration becomes unfrequent and laborious, and consequently the changes\r\nproduced by it on the blood insufficiently performed. In proportion as the\r\nblood is less perfectly changed in the lungs, the circulation through them\r\nis retarded, and the phenomena of asphyxy,--congestion of the lungs,\r\nright side of the head, brain, and liver; the circulation of\r\nunarterialized blood; the imperfect evolution of animal heat, and sedative\r\neffects upon the brain and nervous system generally,--follow in a more or\r\nless marked degree, according to the quantity of the intoxicating fluid\r\nthat has been taken, and either gradually disappear after some time, or\r\nincrease until life is extinguished. These phenomena are heightened by\r\ncold, which depresses the vital action in the extremities and surface to\r\nwhich it is applied, and increases the congestion in the above organs. The\r\nfatal consequences of intoxication are often averted by the occurrence of\r\nvomiting, the stomach thereby being relieved from a great part of the\r\npoison.\"\r\n\r\nBesides wine and spirituous liquors various other substances have been\r\nemployed to bring on this supposed pleasurable state. The Syrian rue\r\n(_Peganum Harmala_), was constantly used by Sultan Solyman. The _Hibiscus\r\nSaldarissa_ of the Indians, which furnishes their _bangne_, is supposed to\r\nbe the _Nepenthes_ of the ancients. The _Penang_ or Indian beetle, the\r\n_Hyosciamus Niger_. The _Belladonna_, the _Cocculus Indicus_, are drugs\r\nthat have been resorted to by various nations. The last ingredient has\r\nmade the fortune of many of our wealthy brewers, at the expense of public\r\nsobriety and health.\r\n\r\nIn the accidents that follow intoxication, bleeding has frequently been\r\nresorted to. Nothing can be more hazardous than this practice, justly\r\ncondemned by Darwin, Trotter, and most physicians, who have had frequent\r\nopportunities of witnessing the distressing train of symptoms that\r\ninebriety brings on. Coffee and green tea will be found the most\r\nefficacious antidotes, when no sickness prevails. Nausea is counteracted\r\nby effervescent and aromatic draughts, such as soda-water, (so highly\r\nappreciated by Byron, when accompanied by a sermon, after a night's\r\nconviviality,) spruce-beer, Seidlitz powders, &c. The ancients had\r\nrecourse to various means to counteract the effects of wine, and amongst\r\nothers we find olives and olive oil, wormwood, and saffron. The Greeks\r\nused a solution of salt, a common remedy among seafaring men to the\r\npresent day; and the Romans surrounded their heads with wreaths of various\r\nrefreshing plants. When Aristotle tells us that Dionysius of Syracuse\r\nremained in a state of intoxication for eighty days, we must suppose that\r\nhe got drunk every morning.\r\n\r\nThat the ancients were in the habit of diluting their wine with water,\r\nthere cannot be a doubt. The Lacedaemonians accused those who drank it pure\r\nof acting like Scythians,--an expression introduced ever since Cleomenes\r\nthe Spartan had learned to drink freely amongst them. The Thracians were\r\nalso accused of this practice, which clearly proves that it was not\r\ngeneral. Philochorus reports that Amphictyon, king of Athens, learned to\r\nmix wine and water from Bacchus himself, on which account he dedicated an\r\naltar to the god. According to Athenaeus, this dilution was of various\r\nstrength; sometimes in the proportion of one to two, at others of one to\r\nfive. The Lacedaemonians used to boil their wine till the fifth part was\r\nconsumed, under the impression that they thus deprived it of its\r\nspirituous qualities. Sometimes this boiled wine was laid by for four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nTo add to the intoxicating power of wine various means were resorted to,\r\nand a mixture of myrrha was supposed to produce this effect. Such was the\r\n_murrhina_ of the Romans, mentioned in St. Mark's gospel, and which was\r\ngiven to malefactors before their execution.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sobriety of the ancients, my fair readers may perhaps\r\nbe glad to know that the ladies were allowed to indulge in an occasional\r\nstoup; and the Greek matrons and virgins were by no means restricted in a\r\nmoderate use of the grape's delicious juice, as illustrated by Homer in\r\nNausica and her companions. In the ancient entertainments the first\r\nlibation was offered up to Vesta, as being, according to Cicero, _rerum\r\ncustos intimarum_, or keeper of things most concealed; or, according to\r\nAristocritus, for the services rendered by this goddess to Jupiter in his\r\nwar against the Giants. However, without any erudite comments, it is very\r\nprobable that even the poor Vestals were sometimes delighted when they\r\ncould take a drop of wine to beguile their solitude.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of drunkenness have been so ably described by Macnish, that\r\nI most gladly transcribe the following passage from that author's\r\nexcellent work, called the \"Anatomy of Drunkenness.\"\r\n\r\n\"First an unusual serenity prevails over the mind, and the soul of the\r\nvotary is filled with a placid satisfaction. By degrees he is sensible of\r\na soft and not unmusical humming in the ears, at every pause of the\r\nconversation. He seems, to himself, to wear his head lighter than usual\r\nupon his shoulders. Then a species of obscurity, thinner than the finest\r\nmist, passes before his eyes, and makes him see objects rather\r\nindistinctly. The lights begin to dance and appear double, a gaiety and\r\nwarmth are felt at the same time about the heart. The imagination is\r\nexpanded, and filled with a thousand delightful images. He becomes\r\nloquacious, and pours forth, in enthusiastic language, the thoughts, which\r\nare born, as it were, within him.\r\n\r\n\"Now comes a spirit of universal contentment with himself and all the\r\nworld. He thinks no more of misery: it is dissolved in the bliss of the\r\nmoment. This is the acme of the fit--the ecstasy is now perfect. As yet\r\nthe sensorium is in tolerable order, it is only shaken, but the capability\r\nof thinking with accuracy still remains. About this time the drunkard\r\npours out all the secrets of his soul. His qualities, good or bad, come\r\nforth without reserve; and now, if at any time, the human heart may be\r\nseen into. In a short period, he is seized with a most inordinate\r\npropensity to talk nonsense, though he is perfectly conscious of doing so.\r\nHe also commits many foolish things, knowing them to be foolish. The power\r\nof volition, that faculty which keeps the will subordinate to the\r\njudgment, seems totally weakened. The most delightful time seems to be\r\nthat immediately before becoming very talkative. When this takes place a\r\nman turns ridiculous, and his mirth, though more boisterous, is not so\r\nexquisite. At first the intoxication partakes of sentiment, but, latterly,\r\nit becomes merely animal.\r\n\r\n\"After this the scene thickens. The drunkard's imagination gets disordered\r\nwith the most grotesque conceptions. Instead of moderating his drink, he\r\npours it down more rapidly than ever, glass follows glass with reckless\r\nenergy. His head becomes perfectly giddy. The candles burn blue, or green,\r\nor yellow, and when there are perhaps only three on the table, he sees a\r\ndozen. According to his temperament, he is amorous, or musical, or\r\nquarrelsome. Many possess a most extraordinary wit, and a great flow of\r\nspirits is generally attendant. In the latter stages, the speech is thick\r\nand the use of the tongue in a great measure lost. His mouth is half open,\r\nand idiotic in the expression; while his eyes are glazed, wavering and\r\nwatery. He is apt to fancy that he has offended some one of the company,\r\nand is ridiculously profuse in his apologies. Frequently he mistakes one\r\nperson for another, and imagines that some of those before him are\r\nindividuals who are in reality absent or even dead. The muscular powers\r\nare all along much affected; this indeed happens before any great change\r\ntakes place in the mind and goes on progressively increasing. He can no\r\nlonger walk with steadiness, but totters from side to side. His limbs\r\nbecome powerless and inadequate to sustain his weight. He is, however, not\r\nalways sensible of any deficiency in this respect, and while exciting\r\nmirth by his eccentric motions, imagines that he walks with the most\r\nperfect steadiness. In attempting to run, he conceives that he passes the\r\nground with astonishing rapidity. In his distorted eyes all men and even\r\ninanimate nature itself, seem to be drunken, while he alone is sober.\r\nHouses reel from side to side, as if they had lost their balance; trees\r\nand steeples nod like tipsy bacchanals; and the very earth seems to slip\r\nunder his feet and leave him walking and floundering in the air.\r\n\r\n\"The last stage of drunkenness is total insensibility. The man tumbles,\r\nperhaps, beneath the table, and is carried off in a state of stupor to his\r\ncouch _dead drunk_.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner is his head laid upon the pillow, than it is seized with the\r\nstrongest throbbing. His heart beats quick and hard against his ribs. A\r\nnoise like the distant fall of a cascade, or rushing of a river is heard\r\nin his ears--rough--rough--rough--goes the sound. His senses now become\r\nmore drowned and stupified. A dim recollection of his carousals, like a\r\nshadowy and indistinct dream, passes before the mind. He still hears, as\r\nin echo, the cries and laughter of his companions. Wild fantastic fancies\r\naccumulate thickly around the brain. His giddiness is greater than ever;\r\nand he feels as if in a ship tossed upon a heaving sea. At last he drops\r\ninsensibly into a profound slumber.\r\n\r\n\"In the morning he awakes in a high fever. The whole body is parched; the\r\npalms of the hands, in particular, are like leather. His head is often\r\nviolently painful. He feels excessive thirst; while his tongue is white,\r\ndry, and stiff. The whole inside of the mouth is likewise hot and\r\nconstricted, and the throat often sore. Then look at his eyes--how sickly,\r\ndull and languid! The fire which first lighted them up the evening before\r\nis all gone. A stupor like that of the last stage of drunkenness still\r\nclings about them, and they are disagreeably affected by the light. The\r\ncomplexion sustains as great a change: it is no longer flushed with gaiety\r\nand excitation, but pale and wayworn, indicating a profound mental and\r\nbodily exhaustion. There is probably sickness, and the appetite is totally\r\ngone.\r\n\r\n\"Even yet the delirium of intoxication has not left him, for his head\r\nstill rings, his heart still throbs violently, and if he attempt to get\r\nup, he stumbles with giddiness. The mind also is sadly depressed, and the\r\nproceedings of the previous night are painfully remembered. He is sorry\r\nfor his conduct, promises solemnly never again so to commit himself, and\r\ncalls impatiently for something to quench his thirst.\r\n\r\n\"Persons of tender and compassionate minds are particularly subject,\r\nduring intoxication, to be affected to tears at the sight of any\r\ndistressing object, or even on hearing an affecting tale. Drunkenness, in\r\nmost characters, may be said to melt the heart and open the fountain of\r\nsorrow. Their sympathy is often ridiculous, and aroused by the most\r\ntrifling causes. Those who have a lively imagination, combined with this\r\ntenderness of heart, sometimes conceive fictitious cases of distress, and\r\nweep bitterly at the woes of their own creating.\r\n\r\n\"There are also some persons on whom drunkenness calls forth a spirit of\r\npiety, or rather of religious hypocrisy, which is both ludicrous and\r\ndisgusting. They become sentimental over their cups, and while in a state\r\nof debasement most offensive to God and man, they will weep at the\r\nwickedness of the human heart, entreat you to eschew swearing and profane\r\ncompany, and have a greater regard for the welfare of your immortal soul.\r\nThese sanctimonious drunkards seem to consider ebriety as the most venial\r\nof offences!\"\r\n\r\nInebriety has sometimes a curious effect upon the memory. Actions\r\ncommitted during intoxication may be forgotten on a recovery from that\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nDrunkenness differs materially according to the nature of the intoxicating\r\npotation. Wine in general may be considered as less injurious, and its\r\neffects more transient than spirituous liquors, that produce great\r\nexcitement, followed by indirect debility and visceral obstruction. The\r\ninebriety produced by alcoholic preparations, moreover, is attended with a\r\ndelirious state, furious and uncontrollable, or followed by congestion and\r\ntorpor. Malt liquors render their victims heavy, stupid, and more\r\nobstinate than violent, and a long continuance in their use produces a\r\nstate of imbecility, observed so early as Aristotle.\r\n\r\nSimilar differences are observable in the effects of different liquors on\r\nthe imagination. Wine most undoubtedly produces a greater vivacity of\r\nideas and a more brilliant scintillation of wit and fancy. Hoffmann,\r\nindeed, considered the juice of the grape as indispensable to poetic\r\ninspiration, and it is very doubtful whether Pegasus was ever benefited by\r\na draught of beer. But, alas! of what avail are the considerations\r\nregarding the effects of the pernicious habit of drinking? When once\r\naccustomed to the cheering stimulus of liquor, it matters not what the\r\ndrunkard takes, and if Champagne or Burgundy are not at hand, gin or rum\r\nwill prove a substitute, perhaps less grateful, but still not unwelcome.\r\nDrinking becomes the only refuge from those cares which owe their very\r\norigin to excesses, and they must be drowned in any bowl that can be\r\nfilled to drive away the blue devils.\r\n\r\n  Vina parant animos, faciuntque caloribus aptos,\r\n  Cura fugit, multo diluiturque mero:\r\n  Tunc veniunt risus, tunc pauper cornua sumit;\r\n  Tunc dolor et curae, rugaque frontis abit,\r\n  Tunc aperit mentis aevo, rarissima nostro\r\n  Simplicitas, artes excutiente Deo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECAPITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have observed in a preceding article, much doubt exists whether\r\ndecapitation puts an end to our sufferings, as it has not and most\r\nprobably will never be ascertained, whether the body or the head are first\r\ndeprived of sensation or vitality. Galvanic experiments had been resorted\r\nto, but were warmly opposed by Professor Ferry on the plea of humanity, as\r\nhe maintained that unless we were certain that sensation had ceased, we\r\nhad no right to submit the unfortunate culprits who had been decapitated\r\nto this trial. Guillotin (whose name was given to the terrific machine so\r\nclosely connected in our recollection with the horrors of the French\r\nRevolution, which he introduced from the East and Germany) maintained that\r\nthe moment the head was severed from the body all sensation ceased.\r\nCabanis and Petit were of a similar opinion. Sue, Aldini, Mojon, Weicard,\r\nLiveling, Castel, and other physiologists, founded their belief in a\r\ncontrary doctrine, upon numerous experiments on various animals. Sue\r\ngrounded his arguments upon two chief points: first, the sudden effect\r\nproduced by decapitation upon the two most powerful regulators of the\r\nfunctions of life, the brain and the heart; and secondly, on the\r\nconsideration that the section of the neck was often uneven and jagged,\r\nsplinters of bones irritating the bruised nerves, vessels, and spinal\r\nmarrow.\r\n\r\nAccording to this view of the matter, existence was not immediately\r\ndestroyed by decollation. Castel thought that this principle was\r\nextinguished in the head sooner than the body. Sue and Julia de Fontenelle\r\nwere of a different opinion. Dubois of Amiens endeavoured to prove the\r\nnon-existence of pain after decapitation, by showing that convulsive\r\nmovements, epileptic and hysteric attacks, were not accompanied by any\r\npainful sensations. In decapitation, he thinks that the suddenness and\r\nviolence of the blow must produce insensibility, for we cannot imagine\r\nthat the section of the spinal marrow thus violently performed can\r\noccasion pain; and if any sensations were experienced in that awful\r\nmoment, it is more than probable that the violent perturbation would\r\nrender them obtuse. As to any feelings of the separated head, he does not\r\nthink that any muscular convulsions observed in it can indicate the\r\nexistence of pain.\r\n\r\nTo these arguments of the Amiens physiologist, Julia de Fontenelle replied\r\nthat it was never maintained that convulsive movements were expressive of\r\npain, although it was not impossible that epileptic and hysterical\r\npatients may have experienced painful sensations during their attacks that\r\nmight be forgotten upon their recovery, as somnambulists bear no\r\nrecollection of what passed during their disturbed slumbers. The\r\nconvulsive affections alluded to by Dubois were frequently expressive both\r\nof pleasure and of pain, or marked with a character of stupor or of\r\nindifference, whereas the convulsive movement observed in the features of\r\nthe decapitated invariably expressed anguish; in support of his firm\r\nbelief in the existence of the power of sensation after execution, he\r\nrefers to the observations of Soemmering, Mojou, and Sue, who had\r\nremarked that when the head was turned towards the solar rays, the eyes\r\ninstantly closed,--a phenomenon that could not take place if the eyes were\r\ndead. Dr. Montault jocosely observes that it is to be regretted that, to\r\ndecide this controversy, recourse cannot be had to the experiments,\r\nrecorded by Bacon, of an inquisitive person who hanged himself for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining if strangulation was a painful operation. One of\r\nhis friends very fortunately cut him down ere it was too late, when the\r\ncurious experimentalist was quite satisfied that hanging was by no means\r\npainful or unpleasant, and that the moment strangulation took place, he\r\nhad been struck with a flickering light, that was instantly followed by\r\nutter darkness.\r\n\r\nVarious cases are recorded of individuals thus cut down, when hanged by\r\naccident, or executed. In most instances they stated that they had\r\nexperienced a pleasurable sensation as strangulation took place. I have\r\nalready alluded to the curious fate of the well-known composer of the\r\n\"Battle of the Prague.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUMMIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch doubt exists regarding the derivation of the word _mummy_. Bochard,\r\nMenage, Vossius, attributed it to the Arabic noun _mum_, meaning _wax_.\r\nSalmasius derives it from _mumia_, a body embalmed and aromatized. The\r\nPersian word _mumiya_, means bitumen or mineral pitch. Abd-Allatif, an\r\nArabian physician, describes mummy as a substance flowing from the tops of\r\nthe mountains, and which mixing with the water that streamed down,\r\ncoagulates like mineral pitch.\r\n\r\nMany are the opinions relating to the custom of embalming men and various\r\nanimals in ancient Egypt. By some it has been considered a superstitious\r\npractice, by others the result of affection. To keep the remains of those\r\nwe loved upon earth free from the destructive power of death, and\r\npreserving in some degree those forms that once flitted before us and\r\naround us in all the enjoyments of life, is a natural, one might almost\r\nsay an instinctive, sentiment;--preserving those fond remains upon earth,\r\nexempted from the painful sight of beholding them committed to the\r\nearth--earth to earth--for ever! How different must have been the feelings\r\nof the relatives of the departed, when leaving the body reposing in the\r\ntomb, still preserving the form of its mortal coil--still in the\r\nworld--where all we loved might be visited and spoken to in the language\r\nof affection and regret--how different must have been these feelings when\r\ncompared to those that compress the respiration and check our utterance,\r\nafter seeing that body separated from us, and leaving a chasm around us\r\ndeeper still than the grave. We are, however, to seek in this practice\r\nother motives. The wisdom of the theocratic government of ancient Egypt\r\nwas most admirable, and not founded upon mortal affections and dislikes.\r\nThe sovereign priesthood had to attend to concerns of greater magnitude.\r\nThe first inhabitants of Egypt, migrating most probably from the upper\r\nregions of Ethiopia, had to colonize an unhealthy region, to struggle with\r\nswamps and marshes, and destroy myriads of animals, whose decomposition\r\nadded to the dangers they had to encounter when settling in such an\r\nunhealthy land. Pestilence, no doubt, as in after times, frequently\r\ndesolated the infant kingdom. Their priests, in whose temples were\r\nrecorded in mystic legends all the science of the age, must have applied\r\ntheir experience and their judgment to meet the evil, and surmount it,\r\nwere it possible. The ideas of corruption are closely connected with those\r\nof putrescency; and putrescency has ever been considered the chief source\r\nand focus of pestilential maladies. To avoid corruption and putrescence,\r\nthen, became one of the most important Hygienic studies; and, like Moses,\r\nwho had received his early education in Egypt, its priesthood enforced\r\nsalutary laws as the injunction of the Creator; nor was the task as\r\ndifficult as it might have proved in a more extensive and more diversified\r\nregion. The population resided in a land of no very great extent; their\r\nclimate did not vary according to prominent topographical circumstances;\r\nand the produce of the soil, as regarded alimentary substances, admitted\r\nof little variety. Thus it became easy to establish salutary institutions\r\nto regulate the mode of living of the obedient people, who looked upon the\r\ncommands of their sainted legislators as dictates from the eternal throne.\r\n\r\nImpressed with the conviction of the immortality of the soul, the Egyptian\r\npriesthood imagined, or, at any rate, endeavoured to persuade the\r\nmultitude that the immortal part of our being was retained within its\r\nearthly house so long as the corporal form could be preserved entire, and\r\nif (which is most probable) they believed in the resurrection of the soul\r\neither in its human form or that of some other animal, this doctrine may\r\nbe easily accounted for as founded upon reason, and grateful to the\r\nsensitive feelings. A belief in the transmigration of souls naturally led\r\nto the desire of retaining them as long as it was possible in their former\r\nabodes; and the lines of Virgil--\r\n\r\n      Animamque sepulchro,\r\n  Condimus,\r\n\r\nwould seem to warrant this belief amongst the ancients. St. Augustine\r\nclearly tells us that the Egyptians did believe in a resurrection.\r\n\r\nAmongst other prophylactic means to resist epidemic diseases the embalming\r\nof the dead must naturally have occurred to the sacred college as one of\r\nthe most effectual means of checking or preventing contagion. Not only was\r\nman submitted to this process, but every animal, domestic or obnoxious,\r\nwas equally preserved. It may be said, if destruction was rendered a\r\nprudent step, why were not these bodies consumed by fire? The reason\r\nappears to me obvious. It was necessary to check the consumption of animal\r\nfood; therefore were various animals considered sacred, and not allowed to\r\nbe immolated for the use of the multitude; other animals were considered\r\nnoxious, and as such their use was forbidden. Religion thus stamped them\r\nwith the irrevocable dye of holiness or corruption. Mystic characters were\r\ntraced upon their remains. The sanctity of these animals sometimes varied\r\nin different districts, and the ibis was venerated where the serpent was\r\ndisregarded. When we contemplate the thousands of crocodiles in the\r\ncaverns of Samoun, the myriads of the ibis in the desert of Hermopolis,\r\nAntinoe, Memphis,--when we behold even the eggs that were destined to\r\nperpetuate their race thus preserved,--had not these animals been thus\r\nrespected, they would have become the food of the inhabitants, and, both\r\nfrom their abundance and their unwholesome qualities, have added to the\r\nfrequent scourges that desolated the land.\r\n\r\nHere again we find that this anomaly was unavoidable: those myriads of\r\nanimals, from the nature of the climate and the soil would have increased\r\nto such numbers as to overrun the land. What was to be done? Had they been\r\nconsidered edible, most unquestionably they would have been devoured as\r\nfood; it therefore became necessary to destroy and embalm them: this\r\ndestruction was no doubt inculcated as a religious duty; otherwise, how\r\nshould we find even to the present day, such numbers of these creatures,\r\npreserved through the lapse of ages, with their very eggs,--another proof\r\nthat even their incubation was checked. Placed between the desolate desert\r\nand the sea, numerous must have been the races of animals who sought\r\nrefuge in this wondrous region; and, as Lagasquie observes, in the\r\nNecropolis of Alexandria and Memphis, at Arsinoe, Charaounah, Achmin,\r\nBeni-Hacan, Samoun, Hermopolis, Thebes, and in innumerable hypogean\r\nmonuments, we find the remains of thousands--nay of millions--of ibises,\r\ncrocodiles, cats, rats, dogs, jackals, wolves, monkeys, serpents, nay,\r\nfishes of various kinds. Passalacqua found at Thebes numbers of birds,\r\nrats, mice, toads, adders, beetles and flies, all embalmed together. Nay,\r\nHerodotus informs us that the animals considered sacred in one city, were\r\nheld in abhorrence in others, a difference of opinion that not\r\nunfrequently occasioned bitter hostilities. Thus the Ombites fought with\r\nthe Tentyrites on account of the sparrowhawks, and the Cynopolitans waged\r\nwar with the Oxyrhynchites from disputes about dogs and pikes. These\r\nschisms no doubt arose from priestly ambition, each temple claiming its\r\nespecial shrine of adoration, for whatever might have been the original\r\nmotive that led to those theological practices, there is no doubt but all\r\nthese animals were to a certain degree typical of the good and evil\r\npropensities of the various deities, as manifested in their several\r\nhabits, whence they were selected in the symbols and attributes of the\r\nsovereign powers. Abbe Banier endeavours to prove that the bull was the\r\nsymbol of Osiris and Isis, and that these divinities were themselves\r\nsymbolic of the sun and moon. Thus the worship of the bull, Mnevis and\r\nApis. The inhabitants of Mendes adored the god Pan, and worshipped him\r\nunder the figure of a goat, and Mercury is represented with the head of a\r\ndog, the most intelligent of animals. Thus in time people lost sight of\r\nthe origin of the worship, and transferred their adoration to the symbols,\r\nas many Roman Catholics transfer their worship of the saints to their\r\nwooden images.\r\n\r\nThe priesthood of Egypt sought not their power in terror, but in affection\r\nand gratitude. They strove to convince the people that they were their\r\ntrue friends and real benefactors; their sole study was their welfare,\r\ntheir greatest pride the nation's prosperity. Gratitude appears to be the\r\nsentiment they most sought to inculcate. The serpent was held in\r\nveneration, because it destroyed noxious vermin; the ibis was respected\r\nfrom the same motive; the crocodile for the protection it afforded their\r\nnavigable waters; yet, by one of those strange anomalies that we find in\r\nmost mythological _reveries_, animals were held sacred, although they\r\nconstantly destroyed other sacred creatures; and while the crocodile was\r\nworshipped, the ichneumons that destroyed its eggs were also entitled to\r\nrespect. Such was the value of the remains of departed relatives and\r\nfriends, that their embalmed bodies were often pledged for large sums. The\r\nmore readily advanced, since their redemption was considered a sacred\r\nduty. Thus do we find worldly regulations, bearing the sanctity of a\r\ntheologic seal. Then again how mighty must have been the hierarchy from\r\nwhose doctrines emanated the Pharaonic splendour of their stupendous\r\nmonuments--works of art, that attracted the notice and the admiration of\r\nall the civilized part of the globe, whose travellers while they flocked\r\nto view their magnificence, were taught to cultivate the sciences and\r\narts, which the priesthood professed, smatterings of which those visiters\r\nproudly carried back as a precious gift to their country. Moreover what\r\noccupation must have been afforded to the people and to their numerous\r\ncaptives, whom they continually dreaded, from the apprehension that in\r\ntheir constant wars, their prisoners might join their enemies--a\r\ncircumstance fully proved in Holy Writ, where we find, in Exodus i. 10,\r\nthat the Hebrews were oppressed, \"lest when there falleth out any war,\r\nthey join also unto our enemies and fight against us.\"\r\n\r\nThis overwhelming power, most fortunately wise and humane, was maintained\r\nby every artifice that ingenuity could devise. Egypt has justly been\r\ndenominated the _Alma Mater_ of superstition, since we have every reason\r\nto suppose, that with much less wisdom and learning, every successive\r\nhierarchy has sought by similar means to retain an equal sway. In Egypt\r\nthis influence must have been amazing, they held the first rank after the\r\nsovereign, whom they assisted in the performance of all his public duties,\r\nwere present in all his councils, and directed his judgment from the\r\nlessons which were laid down for his conduct in the sacred records. All\r\nthe judges and principal officers of state were also selected in the\r\npriesthood; their number must also have been very considerable, since we\r\nfind them classed as chief priests or pontiffs, and inferior priests of\r\nvarious grades belonging to the sacred deities, prophets, judges,\r\nhierophants, magistrates, hierogrammats, or sacred scribes; Basilico\r\ngrammats, or royal scribes; Sphragistae, whose office it was to examine the\r\nvictims, and to put a seal of approbation on them before the sacrifice.\r\nHierostoli, who had access to the Adytum, to clothe the statues of the\r\ngods; doctors, embalmers; hierophori, or the bearers of sacred emblems;\r\npterophori, or bearers of the fans carried before the gods; praecones, or\r\npastophori, bearers of the holy images, and keepers of the sacred animals;\r\nhierolaotomi, or masons of the priestly order, besides innumerable\r\npainters, sculptors, sprinklers of holy water, and flappers to drive away\r\nthe flies.\r\n\r\nKings were chiefly selected from the priestly order, and when they had\r\nbeen members of the military class, they were obliged to enter a\r\nsacerdotal college before they could ascend the throne; even then, they\r\nwere only allowed to be attended by the children of families belonging to\r\nthe priesthood.\r\n\r\nIf such was the influence of priests, that of the priestesses were not the\r\nless powerful. The Pellices, or Pallacides of Amun, filled offices of the\r\nhighest importance, and not unfrequently queens and princesses prided\r\nthemselves in performing their duties. The subdivision of the female\r\nattendants of the temples was also sanctified, and they were chiefly\r\nselected in the families of priests. If we are to believe the Grecian\r\naccounts, these holy women were not remarkable for their chastity; their\r\nindiscretions, however, were confined to their own circle. These\r\nassertions, have been by no means general, nor is it probable that a class\r\nof men who affected so much purity, and observed such a rigid abstinence\r\nto obtain the character of sanctity to which their power was due, would\r\nhave exposed themselves to the results of such an improvident mode of\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nMy view of the origin of embalming both men and animals is borne out by\r\nanother striking circumstance. The moment the practice of embalming the\r\nbodies of men and animals ceased in Egypt, pestilence appeared. At the\r\nperiod when Christianity was introduced into Egypt, the new religion had\r\nto encounter many obstacles in overcoming the obstinate prejudices of the\r\nancient creed. During the four first centuries of its propagation, the\r\nancient customs were persevered in; at last the cross triumphed and was\r\nenthroned, and the practice of embalming was abolished. In 356, St.\r\nAnthony, upon his death-bed, anathematised it as sacrilegious; his last\r\ninjunction according to St. Athanasius, his historian, had such an effect,\r\nthat an injudicious zeal prevailed in Rome, in Constantinople, and other\r\nlarge cities, and led to the practice of inhuming bodies in churches and\r\ncemeteries, notwithstanding the prohibition of the magistracy. While the\r\ndead were interred in towns, or their vicinity, in dwelling houses and\r\ngardens, the remains of animals were scattered abroad to become part of\r\nthe soil, and thus this most dangerous innovation hurried on the\r\ndevelopment of the most dangerous of diseases. In 1542, under Justinian,\r\nEgypt was avoided as the focus of pestilence. It would be difficult to\r\npoint out the exact period when the custom of embalming fell into disuse;\r\nbut it had ceased to be practised at the time when pestilence burst forth\r\nover the land in all its irresistible horrors. The coincidence was too\r\nremarkable not to have been noticed.\r\n\r\nIt is certainly true that the plague had visited Egypt at former periods,\r\nrecorded in holy writ, when we know not to what extent the preparation of\r\nmummies might have been carried, although we find that Jacob was embalmed\r\nby physicians; but when we consider the topography of Egypt presenting a\r\nvast plain exposed to a yearly inundation, its soil preserved for\r\ncenturies from the admixture of animal substances, but of a sudden changed\r\ninto a mass of corrupted bodies of men and animals, acted upon by heat and\r\nmoisture,--when the inhumation of man was neglected, and the offals of\r\nbeasts and reptiles accumulated in pestilential heaps,--we may easily\r\nimagine what a luxuriant field was submitted to the scythe of death.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians had, no doubt, introduced the practice of embalming the dead\r\nfrom Ethiopia, a country abounding in various gums, which served them to\r\npreserve the remains of their relatives. The transparency of these\r\nsubstances had induced some travellers to assert that the bodies were\r\nimbedded in glass, like insects found in amber. De Pau, and many other\r\nwriters, have exposed the absurdity of such a report, since it is more\r\nthan probable that glass was scarcely, if at all, known amongst them. The\r\nPersians enveloped their dead in wax; and the Scythians sewed them up in\r\nskins.\r\n\r\nWhile the foresight and wisdom of the Egyptian sacerdocy was thus\r\ndistinguished by Hygienic institutions, their interests were not\r\nneglected; and the art of embalming, which they monopolized with every\r\nother branch of learning, tended not a little to add to their emoluments.\r\nEvery dead body was their property. Herodotus tells us, that if the corpse\r\nof an Egyptian, or a stranger, was found in the Nile, or cast upon its\r\nbanks, the priests alone had the power to touch it, and afford it a\r\nsepulture. This interesting, although not very veracious author, gives the\r\nfollowing account of the process. There are in Egypt a particular class of\r\npeople whose sole business consists in embalming bodies. When a corpse is\r\nshown them, they exhibit models of mummies depicted upon wood. These\r\nmodels are of three kinds, and vary in prices. The bargain being\r\nconcluded, the embalmers commence their labours. The brains are first\r\nextracted through the nose with a crooked iron instrument; an incision is\r\nthen made in the side of the body with a sharpened Ethiopian stone,\r\nthrough which the viscera are drawn. These are cleansed out, washed in\r\npalm wine, and then strewed with pulverized aromatic substances. The\r\nabdomen is stuffed with powdered myrrha, cinnamon, and other perfumes, but\r\nwithout incense. After these manipulations, the body is sewn up, and\r\nsalted with natrum for seventy days. This period elapsed, the corpse is\r\nagain washed, and swaddled up with rollers of linen, covered with gum,\r\nwhich the Egyptians commonly use instead of glue. The relations, after\r\nthis operation, carry home the body, and place it in a wooden case\r\nresembling the human form; afterwards locking it up in chambers destined\r\nfor the purpose, and placing it upright against the wall. This is the most\r\nexpensive process. The next is more economical. Syringes are filled with\r\nan unctuous fluid, extracted from the cedar; this liquor is thrown into\r\nthe body through an incision performed in the side, and is of such a\r\nnature that it gradually corrodes and destroys the viscera: after the body\r\nhas been duly salted, nothing then remains but the bones and skin, which\r\nthis substance does not affect.\r\n\r\nDiodorus Siculus gives an account somewhat similar, but adds some curious\r\nparticulars. The first class of funerals cost a silver talent; the second\r\ntwenty minae; and the third scarcely any thing. The embalmers divide their\r\nlabours into various offices. The first, or the scrivener, points out the\r\npart of the body on the left side where the incision is to be made. The\r\nnext operator is the incisor, who uses for the purpose a sharp Ethiopian\r\npebble; the viscera are then drawn out, with the exception of the heart\r\nand kidneys; and the body is then washed with palm wine and aromatics. The\r\ncorpse is afterwards inuncted with the gum of cedar, and strewed with\r\nmyrrha, cinnamon, and various spices. It is ultimately returned to the\r\nfamily of the deceased, in such preservation that the eyebrows and eyelids\r\nare uninjured, and the countenance preserves the character that\r\ndistinguished it during life.\r\n\r\nPorphyrius informs us that the embalmers, after having extracted the\r\nintestines, exposed them to the sun, putting up a prayer to that luminary,\r\nand declaring that if the deceased had ever been guilty of any act of\r\ngluttony, the intestines alone were guilty, and they were therefore cast\r\ninto the Nile. Plutarch alludes to a similar ceremony. The _incisor_\r\nappears to have been considered a degraded being, for Diodorus tells us,\r\nthat, after the operation, he was pursued by the relations of the defunct,\r\nand pelted with stones, as having polluted the remains of the dead.\r\n\r\nThese accounts of the ancients have been warmly impugned by modern\r\nantiquaries, who maintained that the various substances stated to have\r\nbeen made use of in the process of embalming, did not possess the\r\nqualities attributed to them,--especially the liquor called _cedria_,\r\ndrawn from the cedar-tree. Rouyer, a member of the Egyptian commission of\r\nsciences and arts, corroborates in a great measure the accounts of ancient\r\nhistorians; and, in a very interesting paper on the subject, we find that\r\nthe bones of the nose are destroyed in some mummies, but left intact in\r\nothers,--a circumstance that would lead us to think that on such occasions\r\nthe brain was left in the cranium. The opening in the side did not appear\r\nto have been sewn up, but the lips of the incision merely brought into\r\napposition. He divides mummies into those in which tanno-balsamic\r\nsubstances had been introduced, and those that had merely been salted. The\r\nfirst species were found stuffed either with aromatic resinous substances,\r\nor asphaltum and pure bitumen. These resinous substances emitted no odour,\r\nbut, when cast into the fire, a thick smoke arose, and a strong aroma\r\nbecame evident. The mummies thus preserved were light, dry, and fragile;\r\npreserved their teeth, their hair, and eyebrows. Some of them had been\r\ngilded all over; in others, the gold had only been applied to the face,\r\nthe hands, and the feet, and other parts. This practice of gilding was so\r\ngeneral, that it does not warrant the belief that it was only the remains\r\nof the illustrious and wealthy that were thus ornamented. These mummies,\r\nso long as they were kept in a dry place, were unaltered; but were soon\r\ndecomposed, and emitted an unpleasant effluvium, when exposed to\r\natmospheric moisture. The mummies thus prepared were of an olive colour,\r\nwhile those preserved with bituminous substances were of a reddish tinge;\r\nthe integuments hard and shining, as if varnished. The features were not\r\naltered, and the cavities were filled with a black, hard, and inodorous\r\nresinous substance. The ingredients thus employed were similar to the\r\nbitumen of Judea; most of them were gilded.\r\n\r\nOther mummies were found without any lateral incision, when, most\r\nprobably, the intestines were drawn out through the rectum. These cavities\r\nwere filled with the substance termed by historians _Pissasphaltos_. In\r\nthe mummies merely cured with salt, when this ingredient is abundant, the\r\nfeatures are obliterated, the surface of the body having been smeared with\r\nbitumen. These mummies which of course are the remains of the poorer\r\nclasses, are the most common. They are heavy, hard, and black, and shed an\r\nunpleasant odour. They boast of no gilding; only the palms of the hands,\r\nthe soles of the feet, and the nails, had frequently been decorated with a\r\nred tinge; most probably by the application of the _henne_. These were the\r\nmummies which were sold by the Arabs in former times for medicinal\r\npurposes. For a further description of the mode of enveloping the bodies\r\nand the history of embalming, I must refer to the valuable labours of Mr.\r\nPettigrew.[52] The process of embalming appears to have consisted simply\r\nin extracting the viscera, or destroying them by some corrosive injection;\r\ndissolving the mucous and fatty matter by the long application of natrum;\r\nand, finally, in desiccating the corpse by exposure to air or stoving.\r\n\r\nMummies have been also found in the Canary islands, where they were named\r\nby the Guanchi _xaxos_. They were light, dry, of a yellow colour, shedding\r\na slight aroma, and carefully enclosed in goat-skins. The operation was\r\nalso performed with a sharpened Ethiopian stone, called _tabona_. Humboldt\r\nfound numerous mummies in Mexico, where desiccated bodies have not\r\nunfrequently been seen in the open air.\r\n\r\nCertain soils appear to possess a preservative quality, without any\r\napparent preparation having been made use of. In the catacombs of Bordeaux\r\nand Toulouse, these dried bodies may be seen, the hair and eyebrows still\r\nintact; but they are dark and shrivelled, and it does not appear that the\r\ncontents of the cavities had been extracted or heeded, the process of\r\ndesiccation being general. The miraculous conservation of bodies recorded\r\nby Calmet in his History of Vampires was nothing more than instances of a\r\nsimilar preservation.\r\n\r\nVarious experiments have proved that the progress of chemistry has been so\r\ngreat, that we might equal the Egyptians in the preparation of mummies, if\r\never such an absurd practice were introduced.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries mummies formed one of the\r\nordinary drugs found in Apothecaries shops, and as considerable sums were\r\nexpended in its purchase as had been laid out upon the _besoards_ of\r\nvarious rare animals. It became a lucrative branch of trade to the Jews.\r\nThe demand not being easily supplied from the vigilance of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, various frauds were introduced. So powerful were the supposed\r\nqualities of mummies, that Francis I. always carried a small parcel of it\r\nabout him mixed with rhubarb. Lord Bacon tells us that mummy has great\r\nforce in stanching of blood. Boyle assures us that it is one of the useful\r\nmedicines commended and given for falls and bruises. The Arabs to this day\r\nmake use of mummy powder mixed up with bitters. This preparation is called\r\n_mantey_, and is esteemed a sovereign remedy for bruises.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROPHOBIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis term has been erroneously applied to the disease arising from the\r\nbite of a rabid animal, since many instances are recorded of mad dogs not\r\nonly drinking freely of water and other fluids, but actually swimming\r\nacross rivers; while, on the other hand, the horror of water has attended\r\nmaladies totally unconnected with rabid injuries: Sauvages plainly\r\nexpresses himself on this subject. \"Apud Gallo-provincales, experientia,\r\ncanes lubosque rabidos bibisse, munducasse, flumen transnasse, ut olim\r\nMaralogis et bis Forolivii observatum, adeoque nec potum aversari.\" Dr.\r\nJames relates the case of a mad dog that drank both milk and water, and\r\nswam through a pond. Similar cases are recorded of mankind.\r\n\r\nThis disease was known to the ancients, and the Greek term for rabies was\r\n_lyssa_, referred to several times by Homer, when Hector is compared to a\r\nmad dog by Teucer and Ulysses. It was also known by the name of\r\n_cynolisson_, _phobodipson_, and _hygrophobia_. According to Plutarch, the\r\ndisease was first observed in the time of Asclepiades. Coelius\r\nAurelianus is the most correct of the ancient writers on the subject. This\r\ndisease, although it may appear in every climate, is far less common in\r\nhot regions than in those of a moderate temperature. In the West Indies it\r\nis unknown; nor has it been observed in South America. In Egypt and Syria\r\nit has never been seen. Mr. Barrow informs us that at the Cape of Good\r\nHope, and amongst the Caffres, their dogs are exempt from the malady,\r\nalthough constantly fed upon putrid meat.\r\n\r\nWater-dread has been observed in various rheumatic and inflammatory\r\naffections, and frequently arises in a spontaneous manner; while many\r\ncases are recorded of the alarming symptoms being witnessed when no rabid\r\nbite has been inflicted. Violent passions, both in men and animals, seem\r\nto impart a peculiar acrimony to the saliva. Meekren, Wolff, Zacutus\r\nLusitanus, mention fatal cases after the bite of a man in a passionate\r\nfit. Le Cat gives a case of death produced by the bite of an enraged duck.\r\nThiermayer gives us two fatal cases of the bite of a hen and a goose, and\r\nCamararius has an instance of epilepsy produced by the bite of a horse.\r\n\r\nOf the cause of this disease we are utterly ignorant: thirst, without the\r\nmeans of quenching it,--the use of putrid food,--sultry weather, have been\r\nconsidered as producing the fearful disorder; but no one instance is\r\nrecorded that can justify the opinion. The streets of Lisbon are crowded\r\nwith dogs, feeding upon disgusting offal, under a burning sky, yet rabies\r\nis scarcely ever observed among them. It is more probable that certain\r\nmental emotions, such as anger and fear, have a peculiar influence on the\r\nanimal. All the aggregate symptoms of the disease show that the nervous\r\nsystem is disturbed; and the singular effect of confidence in the\r\ntreatment of persons bitten by a rabid animal, confirms the fact. This is\r\nfurther proved by many cases of hydrophobia unconnected with rabid bites.\r\nMarcel Donat relates the case of a woman who complained of pains in the\r\nneck and right arm, with constant trembling. In three days the pain\r\nceased, but the tremor continued; a sense of suffocation followed, which\r\nwas attended with a horror of water and every liquid, although the throat\r\nwas burning. In five days she died in excruciating agonies, but preserving\r\nher senses until the last. Koehler saw a young soldier, who, having\r\nfallen asleep against a stove, was suddenly awakened with a sensation of\r\nintense thirst, which he quenched with a draught of cold water.\r\nHydrophobia immediately ensued, and the next day terminated his existence.\r\nSelig relates the case of a man at Neukirchen, who was attacked with all\r\nthe alarming symptoms of this malady after having laboured in the fields\r\non a very hot day, and bathed in the river. The following day he was\r\naffected with violent rheumatic pains, which shortly ushered in an\r\nintolerance of fluids, and inability of swallowing. In the course of\r\ntwenty-four hours he expired. It appeared upon inquiry that a year before\r\nhe had purchased from the hangman of the town some dog's grease, to rub\r\nhimself to relieve some troublesome affection; and it was stated that the\r\ndog had been killed by a gamekeeper, who suspected him of being mad.\r\n\r\nCases of plague have been attended with water-dread. Lalius Diversus saw a\r\nwoman labouring under the epidemic, who was thrown into agonies when she\r\neven saw other persons drinking. Sarcotius, in his history of the epidemic\r\ndiseases of Naples, informs us that the fever was invariably attended with\r\nhydrophobic symptoms. The fever that prevailed at Breslau in 1719,\r\npresented the same peculiarity.\r\n\r\nVarious venene substances have also been known to give rise to this\r\ndisease. Professor Brera, of Pavia, witnessed it after the use of\r\nstramonium. Rancid oils have caused similar accidents. In regard to the\r\ncauses that produced madness in dogs, numerous experiments have been made,\r\nparticularly in the Veterinary School of Alfort: one dog was fed with\r\nsalted meat, and totally restrained from drinking; another was allowed\r\nnothing but water; and the third was not allowed food or drink of any\r\nkind. The first died on the forty-first day; the second on the\r\nthirty-third; and the third on the twenty-fifth; not one of them evincing\r\nany symptoms of rabies.\r\n\r\nIt appears that a peculiar predisposition renders some individuals more\r\nsubject to the accidents that follow the bite of rabid animals than\r\nothers. Mr. Hunter gives an instance in which, out of twenty persons who\r\nwere bitten by the same dog, only one received the disease. It appears,\r\nhowever, that this virus is less volatile than most others, and is capable\r\nof remaining in a dormant state for a very long period; and if we are to\r\ngive credence to many reports on the subject, it may linger in the system\r\nfor several years. At other times, its destructive nature has proved\r\nimmediately injurious. Heisler has given a case where a man was affected\r\nby merely putting into his mouth the cord by which the mad dog had been\r\nconfined. Palmarius relates the case of a peasant, who, in the last stage\r\nof the disease, communicated it to his children by kissing them. It has,\r\nhowever, been clearly demonstrated, that inoculation of rabid saliva does\r\nnot propagate the distemper. Experiments were made both by Magendie and\r\nBreschet in 1813. In 1800, when a dresser in the Hotel Dieu of Paris, I\r\nwitnessed several experiments of the kind, and with similar results. At\r\nthe same period, I had occasion to observe the effect of imagination in\r\nmany cases. Several persons had been bitten by a rabid dog in the Faubourg\r\nSt. Antoine, and three of them had died in our wards; a report, however,\r\nwas prevalent that we kept a mixture that would effectually prevent these\r\naccidents; no less than six applicants were served with a draught of\r\ncoloured water, and in no one instance did any accident ensue.\r\n\r\nThe period of the development of the accidents after the bite in animals\r\nis various. According to Meynall, the disease appears amongst dogs from\r\nten days to eight months after the injury. In the hounds of Earl\r\nFitzwilliam, who were bitten in June 1791, the intervals varied from six\r\nweeks to six months. Dr. James made a similar observation in Mr. Floyer's\r\npack.\r\n\r\nNo malady has been submitted to more curious and fearful modes of\r\ntreatment than hydrophobia; and in many cases such has been the dread of\r\nthe disease, that patients have been smothered or drowned. Dioscorides\r\nseared the wound with irons heated to whiteness; other practitioners first\r\nexcised the wounded part, and then applied fire or caustic. While fire was\r\nresorted to by some practitioners, water was recommended by others, and\r\nsubmersion in a river or a pond has frequently been urged as an effectual\r\nremedy. In the time of Celsus, the miserable sufferer was thrown without\r\nany warning into a fishpond, alternately plunging his head under water and\r\nraising it: when the poor wretch could swim, he was forcibly kept immersed\r\nuntil filled with water. After this experiment, which Celsus terms the\r\n_unicum remedium_, for fear that the patient might be attacked with\r\nconvulsions, he was taken out of the pond, and soused in warm oil. Van\r\nHelmont recommended that the poor devil should be kept under water while\r\nthe psalm _Miserere_ was sung, and most probably the terrified choristers\r\nwere not expeditious in their performance. Morin relates the case of a\r\nyoung woman, twenty years old, who was plunged in a tub of water, with a\r\nbushel of salt dissolved in it, and dipped repeatedly, until she became\r\ninsensible; however, much to the surprise of the bystanders, who thought\r\nher dead, she recovered, and could not only look upon water, but was able\r\nto drink it. Bleeding nearly to death, mercury, cantharides, and various\r\nmedicines, have been also called into aid; but none have appeared to prove\r\neffectual in curing this dreadful disorder. One of the most singular modes\r\nof treatment was the introduction of rabid blood into the system of the\r\npatient,--in fact, a homoeopathic plan of Dr. Rithmeister of Powlowsk,\r\nin Finland, who has recorded several cases to prove that the blood of a\r\nrabid animal, when drunk, is a specific against canine hydrophobia. The\r\ndoctor communicates a letter from Dr. Stockmann, a Russian physician,\r\nstating this practice to be both common and effectual in White Russia.\r\n\r\nWith a view of producing a fresh poisonous action that might neutralize\r\nthe former one, it has also been proposed that a venomous serpent should\r\nbe made to inflict a wound under the bite of the mad dog. I do not believe\r\nthat this experiment has ever been tried; and, as Good observes, the claim\r\nof ingenuity is, most probably, the only one it will ever have to receive.\r\nThis fatal disease is enveloped in so much darkness, both as regards its\r\ncauses and its treatment, that it may well be considered one of the\r\nopprobriums of the profession. The experiments of my late friend Sir David\r\nBarry are, however, of great importance; and in many cases of poisonous\r\nwounds, the application of cupping-glasses has been followed by evident\r\nfavourable results.\r\n\r\nTo ascertain the existence of rabies in animals, more especially in dogs,\r\nis a matter of great importance, as being frequently the source of moral\r\ndepression or of sanguine hope, that may tend to increase or diminish the\r\nseverity of the accidents. One may apprehend madness in a dog when we see\r\nthe animal dull, and seeking solitude and darkness, his sleep disturbed,\r\nand when awakened refusing food or drink. Its head droops, the tail hangs\r\nbetween the legs. The animal soon quits the abode of his master, the mouth\r\nsecreting a viscid foam, the tongue pendulous and dry, the eyes bright and\r\nsparkling. His gait soon becomes uncertain; now precipitate, then slow and\r\nundecided. Impatient, and parched with a burning thirst, he cannot rest;\r\nand the sight of any fluid occasions an instinctive shudder. The rabid\r\nsymptoms now become more violent; the animal will attack and bite other\r\ndogs, although much superior in strength. It is asserted that dogs avoid\r\nhim with terror. On these occasions the fury of the animal is not to be\r\ncontrolled; all ties of attachment are dissolved; and his master is but\r\ntoo frequently the first victim of his indiscriminate rage. Hence the\r\nabsurd popular notion that mad dogs inflict their first bite on those to\r\nwhom they are attached,--a circumstance that simply can be attributed to\r\nthe natural endeavours of a master to check the violence of a domestic\r\ncreature whom he generally can control. Mad dogs seldom bark, but express\r\ntheir angry uneasiness with a growl, which gradually becomes weaker, until\r\nthe animal staggers, droops, and dies. Yet as there may exist many\r\nmaladies amongst animals in which these symptoms are observed, to destroy\r\nthem, as is usually the case, is a most absurd practice, since the\r\nindividuals whom they may have bitten will sink into a fatal despondency;\r\nwhereas, by allowing them to live, if they recover, it is evident that the\r\npatient will be easily persuaded that the dog was not in a rabid state.\r\n\r\nThe following cases, recorded by Dr. Perceval, are curious instances of\r\nthe dormant state of this fearful virus, the effects of which are\r\naccidentally developed.\r\n\r\nA wine-porter was labouring under a low fever; after a time appeared some\r\nsymptoms of hydrophobia, and much inquiry elicited the recollection of his\r\nhaving been slightly bitten by a dog six weeks before. In the interval he\r\nwas convicted of some fraudulent practice in the cellar of his master, to\r\nwhom he owed great obligation, and was dismissed with disgrace. Anxiety on\r\nthis event seemed to produce the fever, which terminated in rabies.\r\n\r\nLately an officer was bitten by a dog, whose madness being recognised, the\r\nbitten part was excised immediately: after an undisturbed interval of two\r\nmonths, he was advised to go to England to dissipate the recollection of\r\nthe accident. There he exercised himself violently in hewing wood, felt\r\npain in the hand which had been bitten, embarked for Ireland, had symptoms\r\nof hydrophobia on board the packet, and died soon after his arrival. From\r\nthe varying period of attack, we might infer that the influence of\r\noccasional causes is very considerable. In the last patient, hydrophobia\r\nsupervened exactly five weeks from the time of the bite: he lost one\r\nhundred and twenty ounces of blood in twelve hours, which sunk him much;\r\nviolent perspiration, and at length delirium, attended the water-dread;\r\nduring the last twenty-four hours he swallowed, and recovered his senses;\r\nand died slightly convulsed, whilst cutting an egg. These cases seem to\r\npoint out agitation of mind and feverish excitation as powerful occasional\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nHerman Strahl has recently related the following case of rabies in which\r\nthe dog that had bitten the patient was not mad. In the month of January,\r\n1833, an innkeeper was taken ill. The doctor found him dressed, and\r\nstretched upon his bed. He did not complain of any particular ailment, but\r\nloathed all food. He at last admitted that he experienced some difficulty\r\nin swallowing; and his mother having offered him a cup of tea, he refused\r\nit with a sense of horror, and his countenance immediately assumed a\r\ncharacter of ferocity that terrified the bystanders. An apple having been\r\ngiven to him, he ate it without repugnance. It was now discovered that,\r\nfive weeks before, he had been bitten by a dog he was training; and the\r\nwound was slow in healing. The dog was sought, and did not show the\r\nslightest sign of disease,--barking, playing, and drinking freely. In the\r\nevening the patient's case was aggravated; and it was with the utmost\r\ndifficulty that he was made to swallow a spoonful of ptisan. The next day\r\nhe was seized with a violent attack of rabies: seeing one of his sisters\r\ndrinking, he fell into a furious rage, dashed a looking-glass to pieces,\r\nand entreated his relatives to withdraw, as he otherwise would inevitably\r\nbite them. This outrageous paroxysm lasted half an hour; at its expiration\r\nhe fell into a tranquil sleep. But at night he was seized with another\r\nattack; and he began to howl and imitate the barking of a dog, and\r\ncommenced breaking every thing in the room of a shining appearance. His\r\nsisters fled in dismay; but he seized his mother, a woman of sixty-five\r\nyears of age, cast her on the ground, and bit her in the cheek. After this\r\ndesperate act, he seemed to be struck with a conviction of what he had\r\ndone, and became more tranquil; but, half an hour after, on entering his\r\nchamber, he was found dead, his head under the bedclothes. His mother did\r\nnot experience any accidents from the injury.\r\n\r\nIt is singular that, in this miserable condition, the patients will\r\nfrequently show singular partialities; and, although repulsing any fluid\r\noffered to them by some individuals, will take it from others, and\r\nattempt, however vainly, to drink. In the Hotel Dieu of Paris, a young\r\ngirl, affected with hydrophobia, would only take a cup of ptisan from me;\r\nbut with looks of inexpressible anxiety returned it to me, after having\r\nstruggled to moisten her burning lips. At Boulogne, a postilion, bitten by\r\na mad dog, was violent with every one but one of my nephews: from him he\r\nalso accepted drink, although unable to swallow it; before dying in\r\nexcruciating agonies, he repeatedly asked for him, and begged that he\r\nmight be sent for. He would not allow, even in his last moments, any other\r\nperson to come near him;--another striking instance of that unknown power\r\nof sympathy to which I have frequently alluded in the preceding pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE SCIENCE OF MEDICINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a former paper I have given a sketch of the progress of the Chirurgical\r\nprofession, relating the many difficulties its members had to encounter in\r\ntheir endeavours to attain that degree of perfection to which surgery has\r\nrisen; a perfection which we have every reason to believe will still\r\ncontinue to be improved by the daily discoveries of the Physiologist,\r\nwhose labours may be considered the theoretical guide of the practitioner.\r\nThe history of medicine is equally fraught with much interest, since its\r\nbeing a science more or less conjectural, it has opened a vast career to\r\nthe speculative mind, and a wide field for the ambitious. Having been long\r\nconsidered a divine inspiration, priesthood in every age considered this\r\nscience an attribute of their vocation, adding to their spiritual and\r\ntemporal power.\r\n\r\nIn a rude state of society it is more than probable that the art of curing\r\ndiseases, as well as that of healing injuries, did not constitute a\r\nspecial profession, but was practised indiscriminately by all persons\r\nwhose experience and position in the midst of their uncivilized kinsfolks,\r\ngave some weight and importance to their advice. Warriors attended their\r\nwounded companions in arms. Parents sought to relieve their offspring, and\r\nchildren endeavoured to alleviate the sufferings of their aged and infirm\r\nsires. Thus, I may say, was the art of healing instinctively taught, and\r\nnot unfrequently the brute creation guided the efforts of humanity; when\r\nman contemplated the means animals resorted to when labouring under\r\ndisease. Plutarch affirms that it is to these instinctive efforts of\r\nanimals that we are indebted for the knowledge of the various properties\r\nof plants. The wild goats of Crete pointed out the use of the _Dictamus_\r\nand vulnerary herbs--dogs when indisposed sought the _Triticum repens_,\r\nand the same animal taught to the Egyptians the use of purgatives\r\nconstituting the treatment called _Syrmaism_. The hippopotamus introduced\r\nthe practice of bleeding, and it is affirmed that the employment of\r\nenemata was shown by the ibis. Sheep with worms in their liver were seen\r\nseeking saline substances, and cattle affected with dropsy anxiously\r\nlooked for chalybeate waters. This study might therefore have been called\r\nan instinctive school.\r\n\r\nHerodotus tells us that the Babylonians and Chaldeans had no physicians,\r\nand in cases of sickness the patient was carried out and exposed on the\r\nhighway, that any persons passing by who had been affected in a similar\r\nmanner, might give some information regarding the means that had afforded\r\nthem relief. Shortly, these observations of cures were suspended in the\r\ntemples of the gods, and we find that in Egypt the walls of their\r\nsanctuaries were covered with records of this description. The priests of\r\nthese shrines soon considered these treasures as their property, and\r\nturned their possession to a good account. Amongst the Hebrews we find\r\nthat the Levites were considered as the only persons who could cure\r\nleprosy, and the practice of medicine became their province.\r\n\r\nThe priests of Greece adopted the same practice, and some of the tablets\r\nsuspended in their temples are of a curious character which will\r\nillustrate the custom. The following votive memorials are given by Gurter:\r\n\"Some days back, a certain Caius, who was blind, learned from an oracle,\r\nthat he should repair to the temple, put up his fervent prayers, cross the\r\nsanctuary from right to left, place five fingers on the altar, then raise\r\nhis hand and cover his eyes. He obeyed, and instantly his sight was\r\nrestored amidst the loud acclamations of the multitude. These signs of the\r\nomnipotence of the gods were shown in the reign of Antoninus.\"\r\n\r\n\"A blind soldier named Valerius Apes, having consulted the oracle, was\r\ninformed that he should mix the blood of a white cock with honey, to make\r\nup an ointment to be applied to his eyes, for three consecutive days: he\r\nreceived his sight and returned public thanks to the gods.\"\r\n\r\n\"Julian appeared lost beyond all hope, from a spitting of blood. The god\r\nordered him to take from the altar some seeds of the pine, and to mix them\r\nwith honey, of which mixture he was to eat for three days. He was saved,\r\nand came to thank the gods in presence of the people.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Ex volos_ of modern times suspended at the altars of saints in\r\nCatholic churches, are similar testimonials of superstitious credulity,\r\nand priestly fraud, and constitute a lucrative branch of business, more\r\nparticularly to waxchandlers, who fabricate simulacra of every organ or\r\nmember of the body that may be diseased.\r\n\r\nSuch was the study and practice of medicine, until the days of\r\nHippocrates, justly named the father of medicine. But even this great man\r\nin his study of the problematic science, attributed to divine influence\r\nall that could not be comprehended and explained, giving the appellation\r\nof sacred, to that which appeared prodigious and inexplicable. This divine\r\ninfluence which was considered as invincible, setting at nought all human\r\nspeculation and mortal efforts, he denominated the [Greek: to theion] the\r\n_Divinum quid_, he also fancied that the principle of fire was the source\r\nof all animation; for the which opinion, more modern writers pronounced\r\nhim an atheist, amongst other bigots, who thus accused him, we find\r\nGundling and Drelincourt, and even Mosheim; while on the other hand, Will\r\nSchmidt, Fabricius, and Bellunensi have sought to reconcile his doctrine\r\nwith the scriptures; and so far from this accusation being founded, it is\r\nwell known that Hippocrates had such an implicit belief in the power of\r\nthe gods, that he got himself initiated in the Eleusinian mysteries at\r\nAthens. We find in his Praenotum the following singular passage:\r\n\"Nevertheless, there does exist in all diseases something of a divine\r\nnature, and the physician who is able to foresee their results, must be\r\nadmired for his judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThis divine _something_, has been the subject of much research and angry\r\ndisputation. Galen considered it to reside in the atmosphere. Fernel\r\nconsidered it the principle of putrefaction and disorganization.\r\nMercuriali placed it in sideral influence, while Professor Martianus\r\nmaintained that Hippocrates had a firm belief in demons and malevolent\r\nspirits. It would be endless to recount all the idle disquisitions on this\r\nmatter, which have too frequently converted universities into\r\nPandemoniums.\r\n\r\nThe earliest teachers of medicine were the philosophers, amongst whom we\r\nmust remark Pythagoras, who founded the school of Crotona, where assuming\r\nthe sanctity of the priesthood he obtained such an authority over his\r\ndisciples, that it gave rise to the common expression of _jurare in verba\r\nmagistri_. This truly wonderful man had learnt in Egypt the secret\r\nsymbolic mode of writing of the priests, and he certainly did apply his\r\nextensive acquirements to the welfare of his country and the benefit of\r\nmankind; according at least to his views of the subject, which we have\r\nevery reason to believe were conscientious. From his youth, when he bore\r\naway the prize in the Olympic games, his lofty ambition, which scarcely\r\nknew any bounds, constantly urged him on in a career of perfection in\r\nevery branch of learning, which ultimately placed him on the highest\r\nground that ever philosopher attained.\r\n\r\nAfter Pythagoras, we find medicine taught by Anaxagoras, Democritus,\r\nHeraclitus; but Hippocrates was justly considered the father of medicine,\r\nand deserved the name of _great_--every line of his immortal works\r\nbreathes a deep knowledge of the phenomena of nature, and an ardent desire\r\nto release the most important of all human sciences from the degrading\r\ntrammels of ignorance and imposture. Nothing can afford a more convincing\r\nproof of the purity of his motives, and the integrity of his principles\r\nthan the formula of the oath which he exacted from his disciples, and\r\nwhich runs as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I swear by Apollo, by Esculapius, by Hygeia, and all the gods, to fulfil\r\nreligiously the solemn promise which I now do make.\r\n\r\n\"I will honour as my father, the master who shall teach me the art of\r\nhealing, and convince him of my gratitude, by endeavouring to minister to\r\nall his necessities. I will consider his children as my own, and will\r\ngratuitously teach them my profession should they express a desire to\r\nfollow it.\r\n\r\n\"I shall act in a similar manner to all my brethren who are bound by a\r\nsimilar engagement, but shall not admit any other to my lessons, my\r\ndiscourses, or the exercises of my profession.\r\n\r\n\"I shall prescribe to my patients, such a course of regimen as I may\r\nconsider best suited to their condition, according to the best of my\r\njudgment and capacity, seeking to preserve them from any thing that might\r\nprove injurious.\r\n\r\n\"No inducement shall ever lead me to administer poison, nor shall I ever\r\ngive a criminal advice, or contribute to an abortion.\r\n\r\n\"My sole end shall be to relieve and cure my patients, to render myself\r\nworthy of their confidence, and not to expose myself, even to the\r\nsuspicion of having abused this influence, more especially when a woman is\r\nin the case.\r\n\r\n\"I shall seek to maintain religiously both the integrity of my conduct,\r\nand the honour of my art.\r\n\r\n\"I will not operate for the stone, but leave that operation to those who\r\ncultivate it.\r\n\r\n\"To whatever dwelling I may be called, I shall cross its threshold with\r\nthe sole view of succouring the sick, abstaining from all injurious views\r\nand corruption, especially from any immodest action.\r\n\r\n\"If during my attendance, or even after a recovery, I happen to become\r\nacquainted with any circumstances of the patient's life which should not\r\nbe revealed, I shall consider this knowledge a profound secret, and\r\nobserve on the subject a religious silence.\r\n\r\n\"May I as a rigid observer of this my oath, reap the fruit of my labours,\r\nenjoy a happy life, and obtain general esteem--should I become a perjurer,\r\nmay the reverse be my lot.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period the physician who founded a school taught every branch of\r\nthe science, and after examining his disciples, gave them a permission to\r\npractise the profession when properly qualified. Hippocrates was succeeded\r\nby his sons Thessalus and Draco.\r\n\r\nThe school of Hippocrates was followed by that of Plato who founded the\r\ndogmatic sect, but his speculative views were succeeded by the more sound\r\ndoctrines of Aristotle, who was one of the first philosophers who applied\r\nhimself to practical anatomy in the frequent dissections of various\r\nanimals, and he struck out the important path which his successor\r\nHerophilus was fortunate enough to follow for the welfare of mankind, by\r\nsubmitting human bodies to the scrutinizing scalpel under the protection\r\nof Ptolemy Lagus, a protection which became the more necessary as he had\r\nbeen actually accused of having dissected living subjects. Tertullian\r\naffirms that he had thus sacrificed six hundred victims; but what faith\r\ncan we place in such an absurd charge, which very probably arose from envy\r\nor prejudice; although his successor Erasistratus, was accused of a\r\nsimilar offence, and in more modern times Mondini, who was the first to\r\nreintroduce human dissections was exposed to a like charge. It was\r\nHerophilus who founded the celebrated school of Alexandria, where under\r\nthe auspices of Ptolemy Philadelphus, Erasistratus succeeded him, followed\r\nby Strabo of Berytus, Strabo of Lampsacus, Lycon of Troas, Apollonius of\r\nMemphis, and many other distinguished philosophers.\r\n\r\nIt was at this period that physicians began to practise surgery, which was\r\nfirst taught with great repute in the Alexandrian school, and where\r\nAmmonicus and Sostrates, surnamed the lythotomists, first distinguished\r\nthemselves by this important operation.\r\n\r\nWhile the science of medicine thus flourished in Greece and Egypt it was\r\nscarcely known in Rome, where the first physician who ventured to practise\r\nwas Archagathus from Peloponnesus. At first the bold adventurer was\r\nfavourably received, but his operations having shocked a people who\r\nconstantly glutted their eyes in scenes of horror, and who beheld the\r\nblood of gladiators flowing in their arena or streaming under the lictors\r\naxe! the imprudent practitioner was stoned to death by the populace, and a\r\nhundred and fifty years elapsed ere another physician could be induced to\r\nvisit the ungrateful country, nor was it until the time of Pompey and of\r\nCaesar that any medical men dared to visit the \"eternal city.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of these was Asclepiades, who commenced by giving lessons of\r\nrhetoric, which were succeeded by lectures on physic, in the first school\r\nof medicine which he founded in Rome. It was on these benches that\r\nAufidius and Nico, Artonius and Niceratus were initiated in the art of\r\nhealing, while Asclepiades formed his celebrated disciple Themison founder\r\nof the sect of the Methodists or Solidists. To this school are we also\r\nindebted for the learned Celsus justly called the _Cicero of medicine_.\r\nUnder Trajan and Adrian the medical profession had attained great\r\ncelebrity and splendour, and under M. Antoninus, and Marcus Aurelius the\r\nworld became indebted to the glorious labours of Galen--but the bright\r\ndays of the healing art were sinking with the star of Rome in the dark\r\nhorizon of barbarism, and the works of these illustrious masters were\r\nsacrificed at the shrine of astrology, magic, and Eastern theosophy.\r\n\r\nFrom this period we find Eastern superstitions mingled with the early\r\npractices and creed of Christianity, when, to use the words of Sprengel,\r\n\"An allegorical explanation of words and even of the scriptures, was\r\ncarried so far by the Jews that it was considered the utmost perfection of\r\nhuman learning. The essence of every science, and the only method of\r\nobtaining, without laborious studies, and in a state of idle\r\ncontemplation, a degree of wisdom beyond the reach of all other mortals.\r\nIt is thus that during the first century of our era the science of Cabala\r\narose, a tissue of all the chimeras of Zoroaster, Pythagoras, and the\r\nJews, and which in time, to the shame of human intellect, invaded the\r\ndomain of learning, and became closely connected with medicine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of the second century of the church, Acibba published\r\na work called _Jezirach_, and Cimeon-Ben-Ischai wrote his book entitled\r\n_Sohan_, in which their cabalistic labours sought to prove, that there\r\nexisted a supreme being from whom emanated ten angels, who formed the\r\nfirst world, in which resided three personified abstractions--knowledge,\r\nintelligence, and wisdom.--Besides this first or primitive world, there\r\nexisted three others moving in concentric circles--the world created, the\r\nworld formed, and the world constructed! So united, so constructed, that\r\nwhatever might happen in the last of these worlds had already existed in\r\nimagination in the first. From this theory it was maintained that the\r\npractice of physic was to call into action all the powers of the superior\r\nworlds; a problem that could only be solved by a cabalistic physician, who\r\nby his piety and contemplation had succeeded in rendering himself worthy\r\nof a communication with celestial agency.\r\n\r\nFacts and observations recorded by long experience were now considered\r\nuseless and contemptible _data_, and all terrestrial knowledge despised.\r\nAnatomy was deemed worse than useless, and the established doctrines of\r\nvarious schools a dead letter. Chaldean, Phoenician, Hebrew words with\r\nmystic significations were introduced as symbolic illustrations of\r\nscience: no language that could be understood, was deemed intelligible,\r\nand any system that could bear the test of reason was denounced as\r\nimpious.\r\n\r\nThus was the career opened to the craft of priests boundless. It had been\r\nbelieved that the apostles were gifted with the power of healing by the\r\nmere apposition of their hands, and their self-named descendants pretended\r\nto possess the same divine attributes--and not only beatified monks cured\r\nwith various oils and ointments; but their very mortal remains, became\r\nprecious in the hands of their monastic successors. When their mouldering\r\nbones had been sold wholesale and retail as precious relics, their very\r\nsepulchres and their shadows brought hosts of pilgrims to herd round their\r\nshrines.\r\n\r\nThe study of medicine destroyed with the glories of Rome, was revived in\r\nEgypt, where Zeno of Cyprus delivered courses of lectures at Alexandria, a\r\nschool which soon after dwindled into decay, sinking into obscurity with\r\nthe once famed academies of Greece.\r\n\r\nThe Roman empire dismembered, Persia became an asylum for fugitive\r\nphilosophy, and the Nestorians founded a medical school at Edessa in\r\nMesopotamia, while other sectarians equally oppressed by ostensible\r\northodoxy, sought a refuge in the city of Dschondi-Sabour, where numbers\r\nof Persian and Arabian students flocked to learn their doctrines, and thus\r\nwe have the origin of the celebrated school of Bagdad under the protection\r\nof their caliphs.\r\n\r\nThis regeneration of science was soon communicated to the shores of\r\nEurope, and the Caliph Alhakam founded a school at Cordova possessing\r\nupwards of 300,000 volumes, and Seville, Toledo, Saragossa, and Coimbra\r\nfollowed the bright example. Thus was a science, banished from Europe by\r\nbigoted and misguided Christians, restored to its former seat by\r\nMohammedans.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the science of medicine under the Moorish government was\r\nso rapid in Spain, that we find one hundred and fifty medical writers in\r\nthe schools of Cordova, and sixty-two in Murcia. While the Moors thus\r\nencouraged these important studies, the priests in the western states kept\r\nthe nations under their control in a state of dense ignorance, and the\r\npractice of medicine such as it was, was confined within the cloisters of\r\nmonasteries and nunneries. There does still exist a treatise of medicine\r\nwritten by Hildegarde, Abbess of a convent at Rupertsberg. Monks opened\r\nmedical schools in several cathedrals, and we find Gregory I. sending one\r\nof these medical propagators to Canterbury, where Theodore, one of its\r\narchbishops, practised the healing art.\r\n\r\nWhile the study of medicine had become a privilege of ignorant friars, it\r\nwas destined to assume a semblance of learning in Italy, where some\r\nintelligent Benedictines founded a school at Salerno. Here the works of\r\nthe Greeks, and Romans, and Arabian physicians were once more brought to\r\nlight, and in the eighth century we find Salerno crowded with students,\r\npilgrims, and invalids. In the eleventh century, this school had obtained\r\na pre-eminence over every other medical institution, and at the period of\r\nthe crusades its fame was universal--not that the ignorant and barbarous\r\ncrusaders were capable of shedding any light on the improvement of their\r\nseveral countries from what they might have learned in Holy Land, but many\r\nof them who had happily returned to Europe, and been landed in the kingdom\r\nof Naples, were cured of their wounds and infirmities by these Benedictine\r\ndoctors, who themselves owed much of their erudition to an African of the\r\nname of Constantine, who had studied at the school of Bagdad, and\r\ntranslated for the monks, who had offered him an asylum, Greek, Latin, and\r\nArabian works, which to them were sealed volumes. Amongst the celebrated\r\nadventurers of rank who had escaped from the holy wars, was Robert, son of\r\nWilliam the Conqueror, who was cured at Salerno of a supposed incurable\r\nwound in the arm. In this manner was the fame of the Salernian school\r\nspread far and nigh, and soon Ferdinand II. founded universities at Naples\r\nand Messina.\r\n\r\nThe course of studies in the school of Salerno was three years of logic,\r\nand five years of medicine and surgery. At the expiration of these\r\nsessions, the student was admitted to examination, and after having\r\npassed, was still obliged to practise for another year under the\r\nimmediate eye of an experienced physician. It was only upon his\r\ncertificate as to his professional capacities, that a licence to practise\r\nwas granted, upon his engaging himself by oaths, to observe the laws of\r\nthe college, to attend the poor gratuitously, and to report to the\r\nmagistracy all apothecaries that adulterated their drugs or neglected the\r\nproper preparation of medicines prescribed.\r\n\r\nThe custom of granting academic dignities may be traced to the Nestorians\r\nand the Jewish professors in the East, where it was carried into the\r\nMoorish possessions in Spain. The school of Salerno was the first\r\ncollegiate body that adopted it in the western Christian institutions. The\r\ndegree they conferred was that of _Magister_. Previous to the granting of\r\nthis distinction seven years study were required, and the candidate was to\r\nbe upwards of one-and-twenty years of age. He had to explain in a public\r\nmeeting the _Articella_ of Galen--a passage of the _Aphorisms_ of\r\nHippocrates, and of the first book of Avicenna, after which he was\r\nexamined in the works of Aristotle, he then received the degree of\r\n_Magister Artium et Physices_. It was only the professors who bore the\r\ntitle of Doctors.\r\n\r\nIn this manner did the science of medicine struggle for several centuries\r\nwith obstacles that appeared insurmountable--in turn practised and\r\npersecuted--anathematized by the clergy, and soon after becoming a\r\nlucrative privilege of the church--prejudice, superstition, and ignorance\r\nhad closed anatomical theatres, and from the days when flourished the\r\nschool of Herophilus until the fourteenth century, the dissection of\r\nanimals was alone permitted, and it was only by stealth that the student\r\nsought some knowledge of the human structure, from mouldering bones\r\npurloined from the cemetery. A brighter era arose in the year 1315, when\r\nMondini de Luzzi, Professor of Anatomy at Bologna, ventured to dissect\r\nhuman bodies--a bold attempt, as seventeen centuries had elapsed since\r\nthis investigation of the book of nature, the only record where errors can\r\nbe detected and truth sought for, had been prohibited. The example of\r\nMondini, who had written a practical anatomical manual was followed in\r\nvarious other schools, but a barber was the person charged with the\r\nopening of the subjects, and with no other instrument then his razor he\r\nendeavoured to demonstrate the parts which Mondini's work described.\r\n\r\nFrom this period we may date the revival of medicine, although in the\r\nfollowing century it made but little progress, still clogged by\r\nastrological absurdities and Arabic errors--and a Florentine physician,\r\nMarcillo Ficin, obtained a high repute by promulgating the doctrine that\r\nthe vital spirits of man were similar to the ether which filled space and\r\ndirected the planets; concluding that if man could obtain this ethereal\r\nprinciple he might prolong his days beyond human conception, he\r\nrecommended the use of preparations of gold to obtain longevity and even\r\nadvised the aged to drink youthful blood to prolong their precarious life.\r\nThese absurdities were refuted by Chancellor Gerson, and the faculty of\r\nParis condemned the Florentine's visions as diabolical and perilous--but\r\nwhat could have been the facilities offered at that time for the study of\r\nanatomy when we find Professor Montagnana, of Padua, boasting of having\r\nexamined _fourteen_ subjects.\r\n\r\nHowever the fifteenth century was destined to witness a remarkable event\r\nin the annals of medical learning, Emmanuel Chrysolore, embassador of\r\nEmmanuel Paleologus, arrived in Italy, to solicit means from the Christian\r\npowers against the inroads of the Turks. Chrysolore, during a protracted\r\nresidence at Venice, employed the leisure which his diplomatic occupations\r\nleft him to deliver lectures on various branches of science, and not only\r\ndid he encourage the study of the Greek language, but corrected the many\r\nerrors that teamed in the Arabic translation of classic works. It was to\r\nthis learned man that the succeeding century were indebted for their\r\nknowledge of the works of Hippocrates, and we find that his doctrine\r\nformed the groundwork of medical studies over Europe.\r\n\r\nBut the study of the phenomena of nature founded on experience and\r\nobservation was not sufficiently visionary and mystic, and soon we see\r\ncabalistic calculation and judicial astrology again subverting all\r\ndoctrines that might lead to sound conclusions. Cornelius Agrippa of\r\nCologne traversed the fairest cities of Europe, to expound the philosophy\r\nof Zamolxis and Abaris; maintaining that every Hebrew character had a\r\nnatural signification, the Hebrew being, according to his ideas, not only\r\nthe most ancient but a sacred language. He asserted that the language of\r\ndemons was the Hebraic, and that all Hebrew letters being either\r\nfavourable or hostile to these evil spirits, they might be conjured by a\r\nproper knowledge of their powers.\r\n\r\nThis visionary not only fancied that letters possessed this influence, but\r\nthat it was shared by numbers. Thus to cure a tertian fever he directs the\r\nuse of Verbena, to be cut at the third articulation of the plant; but in\r\nthe treatment of a quartern, the disease would only yield to the fourth\r\njoints. He added that every man was under the influence of three\r\ndemons--a sacred demon (a divine gift)--an innate demon--and a\r\nprofessional demon, sent us by the constellations and the celestial\r\nintelligences.\r\n\r\nThese reveries, however, were interrupted by the still greater absurdities\r\nof Paracelsus, a man whose ignorance could only be equalled by his vanity,\r\nsince he maintained that as the genius of Greece had produced Hippocrates,\r\nthe genius of Germany had created him for the salvation of mankind. He\r\nfurther assured his disciples that all the universities in the world had\r\nless knowledge than his beard, and that every hair of his head was more\r\nlearned than all their writers.\r\n\r\nParacelsus was perhaps one of the most singular enthusiasts that ever\r\nswayed the schools of medicine, or assumed a despotic stand in science. To\r\nsuperstition, credulity, and disreputable living, he certainly did add a\r\ncertain degree of genius, but more particularly a _tact_ which established\r\nsuch a reputation, that, without much presumption, he might have claimed\r\nthe title which he assumed, of \"_Prince of Medicine_,\" to which he added\r\nthe pompous appellation of _Aureolus, Philippus, Paracelsus Theophrastus\r\nBombastus ab Hoppenheim_.\r\n\r\nThis strange personage was born in 1493, at Einsidlen, a village near\r\nZurich; he studied under Fugger Schwartz, a celebrated professor of what\r\nwas then called the _Spagyristic_ school, or _Hermetic Medicine_, founded\r\non a visionary doctrine that I shall shortly notice. He subsequently\r\ntravelled over the greater part of Europe, chiefly courting a motley\r\nsociety of physicians, philosophers, old women, and barbers, culling all\r\nthat he could from pretended science or unblushing ignorance. After having\r\nvisited the German mines, where he became tainted with the superstition of\r\nthe credulous workmen, he repaired to Russia, when he was made prisoner by\r\na party of Tartars, who conducted him to their Cham. Taken into favour by\r\ntheir chief, he accompanied his son to Constantinople, where he pretended\r\nto have discovered the philosopher's stone. On his return to his native\r\ncountry, the magistrates of Bale appointed him to the chair of medicine;\r\nand in 1527 we find him delivering a course of lectures in the German\r\ntongue, being but an indifferent scholar. This sedentary life did not suit\r\nhis roving habits; and being, moreover, likely to bring his ignorance into\r\nits proper light, he set out for Alsace with another enthusiast of the\r\nname of Oporinus, with whom however he shortly quarrelled. He continued to\r\nwander from town to town, scarcely ever sleeping, or changing his linen,\r\nclad in the most slovenly manner, and generally in a state of\r\nintoxication, until at Saltzburg in 1541 he was taken ill at a miserable\r\ninn and died in the 48th year of his busy life.\r\n\r\nHe no doubt had obtained during his adventurous career much experience,\r\nhaving for a long time followed armies and attended at sieges, and during\r\nepidemic maladies; but he sought to disguise his want of a proper\r\neducation by the assumption of a supernatural influence. One of his\r\nwildest flights of fancy was, perhaps, his receipt to make a man without\r\nconjunction.\r\n\r\nHis doctrines were founded upon Judicial Astrology, Alchymy, Cabal, and\r\nChemistry. Grossly ignorant in the last science, he pretended that all our\r\ndiseases depended upon its combinations,--the combustion of sulphur, the\r\neffervescence of saline particles, and the coagulation and stagnation of\r\nmercury in our humours: all under the influence of the _Ens Astrorum_, the\r\n_Ens Deale_, the _Ens Spirituale_, the _Ens Veneni_, and the _Ens\r\nNaturale_. _Mercury_ was evacuated through the pores of the skin;\r\n_sulphur_ emanated from the nostrils; _deliquescent sulphur_ was\r\ndischarged by the intestines; a _watery solution of sulphur_ arose from\r\nthe eyes, while _arsenic_ oozed out of the ears. When these evacuations\r\ndid not take place, the humour became putrid, and putrescency was\r\n_Localiter_ or _Emunctor labiter_--as the humours were either retained or\r\nexcreted.\r\n\r\nThis humoral doctrine of Paracelsus, strange to say, obtained for upwards\r\nof a century, and many were the learned men who distracted their brains\r\nand that of their disciples to multiply his errors, since we find\r\nSanctorius calculates 90,000 morbid alterations in these peccant humours.\r\n\r\nIn another part of this work, I have related the absurdities of Van\r\nHelmont, another visionary of the seventeenth century. Endless would be\r\nthe task of recording the many systems and doctrines that have in turn\r\nruled the schools of medicine, and been supported both by professors and\r\ndisciples with a degree of virulent hostility as implacable as religious\r\ncontroversies; and still, while we read with contempt the absurd doctrines\r\nof our forefathers, and smile at the folly of their visions, we ourselves\r\nare advocating systems which, after a lapse of some few years, will appear\r\njust as ridiculous and preposterous to our successors in the doubtful\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nOne question naturally arises from all this controversial discrepance--has\r\nsociety benefited by the successive revolutions which have overthrown\r\nschools and doctrines, chairs and professors? have the advocates of\r\nSangradian phlebotomy, and those who considered that the lancet has\r\ncommitted greater havoc than the sword--have the employers of antimony,\r\nand those who would have sent to the scaffold opponents who gave an\r\nantimonial preparation--have either of these enthusiasts diminished, in\r\nany sensible manner, the scale of mortality, or have they influenced the\r\nprevalence of disease? This is a most important question, and, however\r\nungracious may be the task, I shall endeavour to consider it.\r\n\r\nIt is but too true, that, with the exception of the introduction of\r\ninoculation and the cowpox, the bills of mortality do not appear, at any\r\nperiod, to have been influenced by the prevalence of any one medical\r\nsystem. This circumstance, however, cannot be admitted as invalidating the\r\nclaims of medical men to a due consideration of their respective merits. I\r\nhave endeavoured to show, in a preceding article, that the laws of nature\r\nappear to have regulated the equilibrium of life and death and the\r\nprogress of disease with such harmony, indeed, that we might say that our\r\nexistence was regulated with arithmetical accuracy. If this is admitted,\r\nit might be alleged, that if such be our fated tenure of life, recourse to\r\nmedical aid becomes useless, and the efforts of physicians must prove\r\neffete. Such a deduction would be fatalism in its most absurd form; for,\r\nadmitting that our days are thus numbered, the human frame may be assailed\r\nby many ailments, that may not prove fatal, but admit of relief, if they\r\ncannot be cured. It is, therefore, obvious, that the services of a\r\nphysician are of great value, if he merely can alleviate our sufferings,\r\nand render a painful existence tolerable. Daily facts corroborate this\r\nassertion, and the most cruel pangs are constantly relieved by\r\nprofessional aid, although it is not equally evident that the same skill\r\ncan prolong the patient's life, if \"his hour is come;\" but, as we know not\r\nwhen that fatal moment may strike, we must clearly seek to wind up the\r\nmarvellous machinery, and keep it \"going\" as long as we can. We constantly\r\nbehold individuals whose existence is most precarious, and yet who linger\r\non for years, frequently to the disappointment of expectant heirs; for\r\nthere is much truth in the old saying concerning those invalids who are\r\nconsidered to \"have one foot in the grave,\" they find _that foot_ so very\r\nuncomfortable, that they hesitate for a long time ere they thrust in its\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt but that much mischief has been done by ignorant\r\nmen, yet, perhaps, if the truth were known, more vital injury has been\r\ninflicted on mankind by enthusiastic science--ignorance gropes its way, so\r\nlong, at least, as modesty allows to doubt; but, so soon as presumption\r\nleads the way, then ignorance assumes dogmatic assurance, and places the\r\nhardy practitioner on the same line as presumptive science--or, at least,\r\nwhat is considered such. It is then that enthusiasm, combined with\r\ninterested motives, seeks to maintain an acquired influence by\r\nexperimental proofs of supremacy; and, as it has been truly said, \"There\r\nis no writ of error in the grave,\" mother earth shrouds the fallacies, and\r\nevery disease that the eminent practitioner cannot cure is deemed\r\nincurable.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the Creator has gifted mankind with an innate and\r\nlatent power of resisting noxious influence--a power called by the schools\r\nthe _vis medicatrix naturae_, and which is generally sufficient to throw\r\noff morbid attacks, when this principle is not exhausted, and the\r\nfunctions not impeded by organic derangement which involves the healthy\r\nequilibrium of life; then it is, that the prudent and experienced\r\nphysician will carefully watch this precious faculty, and instead of\r\ncounteracting the efforts of nature, assist her bounteous labours. This\r\nwatchful practice, which may, however, be sometimes too inert, has been\r\ncalled _expectant medicine_--a slow and tardy process for the energetic\r\npractitioner, who, assuming the reins of life in his bold hands endeavours\r\nto goad and drive on nature in spite of herself; this practice has\r\nobtained the name of _active medicine_, of which our British practitioners\r\nare accused, by the _expectant_ continental physicians, who, to use a\r\nFrench expression, \"_voient venir_,\" and the French themselves are so well\r\naware of the imprudence of this hesitation in assisting nature, that they\r\nsay \"_Your physicians kill their patients, whereas ours let them die_.\"\r\nThere is more truth in this remark than we perhaps are willing to believe.\r\n\r\nThe power of nature in the cure of diseases has been acknowledged by the\r\nmost experienced and wise physicians. Stahl, in his dissertation, \"_De\r\nMedicina sine Medico_,\" perhaps exaggerated the influence of this faculty.\r\nBordeu maintains that out of ten patients, two-thirds are cured without\r\nassistance, and come within the circle of all those minor ailments to\r\nwhich flesh is the constant heir. The illustrious Boerhaave doubted\r\nwhether the successful practice of the small number of able physicians was\r\na compensation for the evils that arose from the errors of the ignorant;\r\nand, in this sad calculation, he seems disposed to think that it would\r\nhave been better for mankind that the science of medicine had never\r\nexisted.\r\n\r\nAll these deductions are both unjust and unwise; for, as I have already\r\nsaid, if physicians only possessed the means of affording relief, their\r\nmission upon earth is of the utmost importance. At the same time, while\r\nwe watch the efforts of nature, it is our duty to rouse her energies when\r\nthey become torpid, or to check inordinate action which would soon exhaust\r\nher power. Asclepiades very truly called the expectant practice of\r\nmedicine \"_a contemplation of death_.\" The powers of nature may be, and\r\nnot inaptly, compared to those of the swimmer; however skilled in the art\r\nof natation, and able under ordinary circumstances to baffle an adverse\r\ntide, are we not to hasten to his succour, when we find that he is borne\r\naway by an inevitable current, or deprived by a cramp, of the power of\r\nstemming the stream?\r\n\r\nWe are also willing to forget, that the turbulence of passions, the \"wear\r\nand tear\" of life, by excesses or irregularities, gradually tend to render\r\nthe \"medicinal power\" of nature of little or no avail; and it has been\r\ntruly said, that had we no cooks, we perhaps might not have needed\r\nphysicians. Man in fact, in a high state of civilization, seems determined\r\nto counteract all the efforts both of nature and of art to relieve him\r\nfrom the manifold curses of intemperance; and it is fortunate that his own\r\nfeelings of gradual decay prompt him more energetically to a reform in his\r\nhabits, than the most persuasive language his physician could employ.\r\n\r\nIn this illiberal view of the profession, how often do we lose sight of\r\nhereditary transmissions--heir-looms of disease--ingrafting misery on the\r\nvariegated woof of our destinies--germs of fatal maladies which we\r\nbring into the world--a scourge on our posterity!--and yet, strange to\r\nsay, our vain self-estimation blinds us in the contemplation of this\r\ndoom--for the gratification of our desires, we bring forth a fearful\r\ngeneration--scrofulous, insane! Nay, we glory in the smiling offspring\r\nblooming around us--heedless, that the very roses we admire on their\r\ntransparent cheeks, the coral hue that tinges their lips, are typical of\r\nflowers scattered on a grave, and the joyful beams of their bright yet\r\nlanguid looks are but the harbingers of the smile of death--the last kind\r\nlook on earthly things.--And the physician is expected to arrest the hand\r\nof Providence--to eradicate germs struck before birth!\r\n\r\nIt must also be observed, that many of our maladies are, in fact,\r\nreactions of nature, endeavouring to overcome other affections--a struggle\r\nfor harmonious unity--for healthy equilibrium. Thus do we see a burning\r\nfever, tending to cast upon the surface exanthematic eruptions--a febrile\r\nreaction which we call critical, and which too often, like a political\r\ncrisis, destroys in fruitless endeavours to save. \"_Si natura non moveat,\r\nmove, tu, motu ejus_\" was an ancient axiom; but how often, in seeking to\r\ntrim the expiring lamp of life, do we not extinguish the last vital spark!\r\n\r\nIn regard to the influence of medicine on population, can it be expected,\r\nthat when the most fatal pestilences do not thin it, the most erroneous\r\nmedical practice can be more destructive? And, if nine-tenths of cholera,\r\nor pestiferated patients perish, on the other hand, nine-tenths of other\r\ncases of a less serious character are cured without medical intervention;\r\nand possibly, the chief study of a physician should be not to produce a\r\nmore obstinate disease by the means he employs to cure an affection less\r\nformidable. Late years have proved that the effects of mercury were far\r\nmore dreadful than the disease it was supposed to eradicate.\r\n\r\nIn the animadversions that are accumulated upon the physician, an\r\ninsidious comparison to his disadvantage, has been made with the utility\r\nof the surgeon--a utility which man is compelled, however reluctantly, to\r\nacknowledge, since it is evident to his most gross senses--an amputated\r\nlimb--a reduced luxation--are before his eyes, while the favourable\r\nchanges operated on a morbid condition of the body are not self-evident,\r\nand can only be recognised by sound and unbiassed judgment. In this\r\nilliberal view, it is forgotten that the mere operative surgeon is nothing\r\nmore than a mechanical agent--a butcher could perform the same operation\r\nwith his rude knives and saws as the chirurgeon with his refined and\r\nimproved instruments; it is the judgment that we look to, and the skill in\r\nattending to the general health of the patient, to bring him to a perfect\r\ncure; in these functions, of much more importance than the dexterity of\r\nthe hand, the surgeon clearly assumes the duties of the physician; and it\r\nis not possible for a man to excel in one part of the profession without\r\nbeing conversant with the other; a surgeon must be a sound anatomist, and\r\nan observant physiologist--without the knowledge of these fundamental\r\nsciences, a surgeon and a physician might be compared to the bungler who\r\nattempted to repair a watch, without a previous acquaintance with its\r\nintricate machinery.\r\n\r\nLet us hope that the mischievous distinction between surgery and medicine\r\nmay soon become an obsolete prejudice, that was never founded upon reason,\r\nbut simply based upon ambitious lucre. Let us hope that the graduate of an\r\nuniversity will not conceive it beneath his dignity to save a\r\nfellow-creature's life by breathing a vein, and not esteem a vain and\r\npompous piece of parchment an immunity from humane feelings and\r\nphilanthropic duties.\r\n\r\nAs good often results from apparent evil, the converse must also be\r\nfrequently admitted. That much evil has occurred from errors in medical\r\ndoctrine is unfortunately but too true, yet this evil has never attained\r\nthe extent which is generally supposed. I have already alluded to the\r\ncurative powers of nature, ever tending, while still enjoying a portion\r\neven of their energies, to repel obnoxious agents--this power has saved\r\nthe lives of many; and indeed, when we daily witness the excesses\r\ncommitted by the sensualist and the drunkard with apparent impunity,\r\nalthough exposed to destructive agencies more powerful than the generality\r\nof medicinal substances, we must come to the conclusion that the kitchen\r\nand the cellar are, at least, as formidable as the officinal preparations\r\nof the pharmacopolist.\r\n\r\nThat the physician, guided by experience and sound observation, is able,\r\nin very many cases to afford relief, must even be admitted by the most\r\nhostile depreciator of his science, who refuses to admit that he possesses\r\nthe power of curing. This simple admission of daily facts, must entitle\r\nhim to some degree of weight in our confidence, whatever may be our\r\nsceptical view of his doctrines.\r\n\r\nWhile the real merits of a physician are so frequently overlooked, we\r\nconstantly see a blind confidence reposed in a quack. The cause is\r\nobvious. A man of real merit seldom extols his own good qualities, nor\r\ndoes he seek the fulsome adulation and praise of others. He rests upon his\r\nown deserts; but how seldom are they rewarded: when modesty places her\r\nlight \"under a bushel\" who will bring it into view?\r\n\r\nDuclos has explained in some measure this apparent anomaly.--\"The desire,\"\r\nhe says \"to obtain a high stand in the estimation of society, has given\r\nrise to reputation, celebrity, and renown,--the mainsprings of worldly\r\naction--arising from a similar principle, but showing different means and\r\nresults. Both reputation and renown may be enjoyed at the same time and\r\nyet be widely different. The public is not unfrequently surprised at the\r\nreputations that it had itself created. It seeks to inquire into their\r\norigin, but not being able to discover a merit which never did exist, it\r\ngradually admires and respects a phantom of its own evocation. As society\r\nthus bestows a reputation in a capricious manner, quacks will usurp one by\r\ntheir intrigues or by a barefaced impudence, which cannot claim the\r\ncomparatively honourable denomination of proper pride and dignity. They\r\nthemselves proclaim their merit to the world--at first their impertinence\r\nbecomes a subject of derision, but they repeat the assertion of their\r\nsuperior skill so frequently and confidently, that they end by imposing\r\nthemselves upon society. People forget where, whence, and from whom they\r\nheard these flattering eulogies, to which at last they yield their\r\ncredence, and an adventurer who thus resolves to establish a reputation,\r\nwith perseverance and impudence seldom fails.\"\r\n\r\nIt must also be remembered, that most medical men owe their success to\r\nwoman's all-powerful aid. They are in general as blind and as pertinacious\r\nin their partialities as in their dislikes; seldom bestowing much judgment\r\nin either, but acting according to the impulses of their warm passions and\r\nflexibility. Females, from their situation in the world, stand in constant\r\nneed of a friendly adviser, although they are rarely disposed to follow\r\nany advice, if their pleasures are marred by the suggestion, but when art\r\nand opportunity enable a man to turn their flexibility, their\r\n_impressionability_ to a good account, with the combined aid of vanity and\r\nweak nerves, he will in all probability succeed in obtaining a high\r\nestimation in the mind of a loquacious dame, who will blazon his fame far\r\nand near like the trumpeter of a mountebank. If this lady moves in an\r\nelevated and influencial sphere of life, to question her recommendation is\r\nto question her sense and power, both of which would be bold attempts; and\r\nthus have we seen an intriguing noble dame forcing a physician even upon\r\nroyalty. Moreover, when we recollect that the wealthy send for a physician\r\nfor every trifling real or supposed indisposition, which fashion or\r\nexpediency may aggravate at will, to excite interest or carry a desirable\r\npoint, it is manifest that the _cures_ of such a practitioner must be most\r\nnumerous, since the attainment of any desire constitutes a _panacea_; and\r\nfrequently we have seen a box at the opera, a check on a banker, a new\r\ncarriage, or a diamond necklace, more efficacious than the most renowned\r\nnostrum, while the expulsion of an unpleasant plain-spoken acquaintance,\r\nor the kind reception of a dangerous and treacherous inmate, may produce\r\nmore sudden recoveries than the most approved specific. The great science\r\nof such practitioners is to practise with equal success upon every branch\r\nof the family, to whom in return for their confidence, they can ensure\r\npeace and pleasure if they cannot bestow health. I cannot better conclude\r\nthis article than by quoting the following passage of the sceptic\r\nVoltaire:\r\n\r\nIt is true that regimen is preferable to physic. It is also true that for\r\na long period of time, out of one hundred physicians were twenty-eight\r\nquacks, and it is also true, that Moliere had very good reason to turn\r\nthem into ridicule. It is also certain that nothing can be more absurd\r\nthan to behold a crowd of silly women, and men, not less feminine in their\r\nhabits, whenever they are satiated with eating, drinking, gambling, and\r\nlate hours, calling in a physician for every trifling headache; consulting\r\nhim as though he were a divinity, and praying for the miraculous gift of\r\ncombined health and intemperance. It is nevertheless true, that a good\r\nphysician in a hundred cases may preserve life and limb. A man falls down\r\nin an apoplectic fit, it will neither be a captain of infantry or a privy\r\ncouncillor that will relieve him. A cataract obscures my vision; my\r\nneighbouring gossips will not restore my sight; for here I make no\r\ndistinction between the physician and the surgeon. For a long time the two\r\nprofessions have been inseparable. Men who would make it their study to\r\nrestore health to their fellow-creatures on the sole grounds of humanity\r\nand benevolence, should be considered greater than the greatest man upon\r\nearth, and bordering upon divine attributes, for preservation and\r\nrestoration stand next in rank to creation. The Romans were for upwards of\r\nfive hundred years without physicians. Their people, continually employed\r\nin killing, thought but little of the preservation of life; what did they\r\ndo when they were attacked with a putrid fever, a fistula, a hernia, or a\r\npleurisy?--_They died._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICINE OF THE CHINESE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis singular people possess works on medical science which they trace as\r\nfar back as three thousand years, and chiefly written by two of their\r\nemperors, _Chin-nong_ and _Hoang-ti_. It has been asserted that they\r\nreceived the early elements of the science from the Egyptians, but it is\r\nmore probable that they derived their information from their constant\r\nintercourse with the Bactrians, whose arts and sciences were flourishing\r\nat the period of Alexander's conquests, and the Chinese historians in\r\nsupport of this probability, state that several learned physicians came\r\nfrom Samarcand to establish themselves amongst them. Moreover, the\r\ndoctrines of Erasistratus bear much resemblance to those of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe superstitious regard shown to the bodies of the departed, must\r\nnaturally have materially retarded the progress of anatomical pursuits,\r\nalthough this people assure us that 2706 years before our era they\r\npossessed a work on this subject, entitled _Nim Kin_. Howbeit it seems\r\nprobable, from their extreme ignorance of the structure of the human body,\r\nthat this important branch of the science of medicine has remained\r\nstationary ever since the publication of the aforesaid treatise.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese physicians divide the body into a right and left portion, and\r\nthree regions. The upper one, comprising the head and the chest, a middle\r\none, extending from the lower part of the thorax to the umbilicus, and an\r\ninferior region, comprising the hypogaster and lower extremities. They\r\nadmit twelve viscera as the sources of life, but they do not appear to\r\nhave any distinct notion of the division, uses and conformation of the\r\nmuscles, nerves, vessels, and the various tissues of the human economy.\r\nTheir ignorance equally extends to the construction of animals.\r\n\r\nThey consider that man is influenced by two principles, heat and humidity,\r\nthe harmony of which constitutes life, which ceases when their\r\nequilibrious state is destroyed. Vital moisture resides in the heart,\r\nlungs, liver, spleen, and kidneys, while vital heat pervades the\r\nintestines, the stomach, the pericardium, the gall-bladder and the\r\nureters. These two principles are transmitted through the medium of the\r\nvital spirits and the blood by twelve canals, one of which carries a\r\nfecundating moisture from the head to the hands; another from the liver to\r\nthe feet; a third from the kidneys to the left side of the body; and a\r\nfourth from the lungs to the right division.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these channels of vital transmission, they imagine that the\r\nstate of our internal organs can be ascertained by the appearance of\r\nvarious parts of the head, which they consider as indicative sympathies of\r\nthe action of the internal viscera. For instance, the head corresponds\r\nwith the tongue, the lungs with the nostrils, the spleen with the mouth,\r\nthe kidneys influence the ear, the liver acts upon the eyes, and thus they\r\nconsider that they can form a correct idea of the nature of internal\r\nmaladies by the complexion, the state of the eyes, the sound of the voice,\r\nthe taste, and the smell of the patient.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese physiologists also consider the human body as a harmonic\r\ninstrument, of which the muscles, tendons, nerves, arteries, &c. are\r\nvibrating chords, producing various sounds and modulations, and the pulse\r\ntheir chief guide in ascertaining the nature of disease, is but the result\r\nof a modification of these sounds as the chords are more or less extended\r\nor relaxed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these singular views of the human economy, they imagine\r\nthat the body is influenced by five elementary agents, earth, minerals,\r\nwater, air, and fire.\r\n\r\nFire prevails in the heart and the thoracic viscera, which bear an\r\nastronomic relation with the south.\r\n\r\nThe liver and the gall-bladder are under the influence of air, which is in\r\nrelation with the east, whence the winds arise, and it is towards spring\r\nthat these organs are generally affected.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys and ureters are ruled by water, astronomically associated with\r\nthe north--hence winter is the usual season of the maladies in these\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe stomach and spleen are regulated by earth, and are placed in connexion\r\nwith the centre of the firmament, between the five cardinal points, and\r\naffections of these parts are observed in the third month of each quarter.\r\n\r\nDiseases are distinguished by their vicinity to or their distance from the\r\ncentral part of the body, the heart and lungs, and are usually occasioned\r\nby vicissitudes in the atmospheric constitution--varying with cold, heat,\r\nand moisture.\r\n\r\nThe minuteness of their division of maladies is as great as the mechanical\r\nprecision which all their labours exhibit: for instance, they admit no\r\nless than forty-two varieties of the smallpox; according to the shape,\r\ncolour, situation of the pustules, which they compare to the cocoons of\r\nthe silkworm--to strings of beads--chaplets of pearls--and lay equal\r\nstress on their being flat or round--black, red, or violet. This disease\r\nhas, indeed, been described by them with much accuracy and judgment, as\r\nregards its benign or its confluent character; and there is no doubt that\r\ninoculation was practised among them from time immemorial, as I have\r\nalready shown in the article on that head. Equally accurate have they been\r\nin detailing the various symptoms of gout, scurvy, elephantiasis, and\r\nsyphilis, which also scourges the \"Celestial empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe chief guide, however, in their diagnosis and prognosis, is the state\r\nof the pulse, and a very curious work, called \"The Secrets of the Pulse,\"\r\nand said to have been written two centuries before our era, by\r\n_Ouang-chou-ho_ or _Vam-xo-ho_. The pulse is divided into the external,\r\nthe middle, and the deep--producing _nine_ different pulsations called\r\n_Heon_, and the arterial beats were formerly sought for in the joint of\r\nthe big toe; this custom is now abandoned, but they still follow the\r\nstrange practice of taking up the right wrist in women and the left in\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe external pulse, called _Piao_, is subdivided into several varieties.\r\n\r\n1. The superficial P. in _Feou_, which yields to the slightest pressure.\r\n\r\n2. The hollow P. _Kong_, which announces that the artery is empty when\r\npressed upon.\r\n\r\n3. The slippery P. _Hang_, which slides under the fingers, like the beads\r\nof a necklace.\r\n\r\n4. The full P. _Che_, striking against the fingers with a full caliber of\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n5. The tremulous P. _Hien_, vibrating like the chord of a musical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n6. The intermittent P. _Kin_, vibrating by starts, like the instrument\r\ncalled _Kin_.\r\n\r\n7. The regurgitating P. _Hong_, the strong pulsation of a full and\r\ndistended vessel.\r\n\r\nThese seven characters are considered much more favourable than the eight\r\nwhich follow, and which, arising from a deeper action, require a more\r\nforcible pressure.\r\n\r\n1. The deep P. _Tehin_, only discovered by a firm pressure.\r\n\r\n2. The filiform P. _Ouei_, a threadlike pulsation.\r\n\r\n3. The moderate P. _Ouan_, slow and languid.\r\n\r\n4. The sharp P. _Soe_, producing the sensation of a cutting or sawing\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\n5. The slow P. _Tehis_, when the pulsations follow each other with languid\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n6. The sinking P. _Fou_, when the pulse, although pressed hard, sinks\r\nunder the finger.\r\n\r\n7. The soft P. _Sin_, which feels like a drop of water one might press\r\nupon.\r\n\r\n8. The weak P. _Yo_, which yields the sensation of feeling like a worn-out\r\ntexture, and ceases to be observed when pressed upon for any time.\r\n\r\nTo these are added nine other varieties, called _Tao_.\r\n\r\n1. The long P. _Tehang_, full, smooth--feeling like a full tube.\r\n\r\n2. The short P. _Toan_, presenting a pointed surface, that seems\r\nindivisible.\r\n\r\n3. The empty P. _Hin_, insensible under moderate pressure.\r\n\r\n4. The tight P. _Tsou_, which the finger feels with difficulty.\r\n\r\n5. The embarrassed P. _Kie_, languid and occasionally stopping.\r\n\r\n6. The intermittent P. _Tai_, when several pulsations appear to be\r\nmissing.\r\n\r\n7. The slender P. _Sie_, so slow and weak, that it feels like a hair.\r\n\r\n8. The moving P. _Tong_, that one might compare to stones under water.\r\n\r\n9. The tense P. _Ke_, feeling like a distended drum-head.\r\n\r\nBut as many Chinese doctors were not satisfied with this confusion in the\r\nclassification of pulses, and, like practitioners in other countries,\r\nsought to render darkness still more visible--they sought to strike out a\r\nnew career by increasing the multiplication, and introduced the following\r\n_addenda_:\r\n\r\n1. The strong pulse, _Ta_, filling the vessel, yet yielding to pressure.\r\n\r\n2. The precipitate P. _Son_, in which the pulsation was rapid in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n3. The scattered P. _San_, soft, slow, and non-resisting.\r\n\r\n4. The stray P. _Li-king_, strong--not pulsating three times in each\r\ninspiration.\r\n\r\n5. The firm P. _Tun_, consistent and resisting.\r\n\r\n6. The lively P. _Ki_, pulsation rapid in succession.\r\n\r\n7. The skipping P. _Teng_, pulsation unequal, sudden, and frequent.\r\n\r\nIn this minute attention to the many variations of the pulses, the Chinese\r\naided their study, by attending to age, sex, stature, constitution, the\r\nseasons, the passions, and the comparative state of health and disease.\r\n\r\nIn a person of high stature, the pulse was full--concentrated in\r\ndiminished individuals--deep and embarrassed in fat subjects--long and\r\nsuperficial in the meager--soft in the phlegmatic temperament--tremulous\r\nin the lively and the active--slower in man than in woman, excepting when\r\nthreatened with disease--full and firm in the adult--slow and feeble in\r\nold age--soft and vivacious in infancy.\r\n\r\nThe rhythm of the pulse was affected by the passions, though chiefly in a\r\ntransient manner:--moderately slow, in joy--short, in grief--deep, under\r\nthe impression of fear--precipitate and regurgitating, in anger. In the\r\nspring, they maintained that the pulsation was tremulous--replete, in\r\nsummer--spare and superficial, in autumn--dry and deep, in winter. Much\r\nmysterious ceremony was observed by the Chinese physicians in this\r\ninvestigation; they felt the pulse with four fingers, which they\r\nalternately raised or dropped on the vessel, as if playing on a musical\r\ninstrument.\r\n\r\nIn this profound study, they attributed to every disease a peculiar state\r\nof the pulse by which it could be recognised and ascertained, and at the\r\nsame time it enabled them to form a favourable or unfavourable\r\nprognostic. Some of these rules are curious. If the pulses stop before\r\nfifty pulsations have been counted, disease is at hand; when an\r\ninterruption in the course of the circulation takes place after forty\r\npulsations, the patient has not more than four years to live; when an\r\ninterruption takes place after the third pulsation, three or four days are\r\nthe probable term of existence; but the patient may linger on for six or\r\nseven days more, when the interruption only succeeds the fourth pulsation.\r\n\r\nIdle as these speculations may appear, it is to be feared that while the\r\nChinese paid such minute attention to the state of the circulation, more\r\ndistinguished and learned schools do not consider this powerful indication\r\nof the strength or weakness of the vital functions with sufficient care\r\nand discrimination, and perhaps a translation of the works of\r\n_Ouang-chou-ho_, might not be altogether useless in the present\r\nenlightened age. I have no hesitation in saying that this important\r\ninvestigation is sadly neglected in medical education--so much so indeed,\r\nthat the different appellations given to the varied state of the pulse,\r\nare neither well defined nor generally understood. The French physician\r\nBordeu has given much valuable information on this subject, which occupied\r\nthe ancients as much as it seems to have fixed the attention of the\r\nChinese. We find that the Indians, in the time of Alexander, accurately\r\nstudied this important point.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the assertion of Sprengel, Hippocrates was a most\r\nattentive observer of the state of the pulse. Thus we find him giving the\r\nname of [Greek: sphygmos] to that violent and spasmodic beating of the\r\nartery, which was not only sensible to the touch, but evident to the\r\nbystander's eye--in more than forty passages of his immortal works do we\r\nfind important references to the pulse, which he also declared could\r\nenable us to detect the secret workings of the passions. Many were the\r\nancient physicians who have minutely entered into these investigations,\r\namongst them we may name Herophilus, Erasistratus, Zeno, Alexander\r\nPhilalethes, Heraclides of Erythrae, Heraclides of Tarentum, Aristoxenes.\r\nSeveral of the doctrines founded on these observations were most absurd,\r\nattributing the various conditions of the circulation to the _Pneuma_ of\r\nthe heart and arteries; such were the doctrines of Asclepiades, Agathinus,\r\nGalen, and many others; and amongst the Arabians we find _Thabeth Ebn\r\nIbrahim_ asserting that by the state of the pulse he could ascertain what\r\narticles of food had been taken--in more modern times Baillou, Wierns,\r\nBoerhaave, Hoffmann, have sedulously applied themselves to this most\r\nessential study, and Schelhammenn asserts that the pulse never once\r\ndeceived him.\r\n\r\nThe effect of our passions on the circulation is much more powerful than\r\nis generally believed, and they are a more fertile source of our maladies\r\nthan is commonly apprehended. We can readily conceive why the Spartan\r\nChilo died through excess of joy whilst embracing his victorious son.[53]\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of disease, the Chinese, so fond of classification,\r\ndivide the medicinal substances they employ into heating, cooling,\r\nrefreshing, and temperate; their _materia medica_ is contained in the work\r\ncalled the _Pen-tsaocang-mou_ in fifty-two large volumes, with an atlas of\r\nplates; most of our medicines are known to them and prescribed; the\r\nmineral waters, with which their country abounds, are also much resorted\r\nto; and their emperor, _Kang-Hi_, has given an accurate account of several\r\nthermal springs. Fire is a great agent, and the _moxa_ recommended in\r\nalmost every ailment, while acupuncture is in general use both in China\r\nand Japan; bathing and _champooing_ are also frequently recommended, but\r\nblood-letting is seldom resorted to.\r\n\r\nChina has also her animal magnetizers, practising the _Coug fou_, a\r\nmysterious manipulation taught by the bonzes, in which the adepts produce\r\nviolent convulsions.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese divide their prescriptions into seven categories.\r\n\r\n1. The great prescription.\r\n\r\n2. The little prescription.\r\n\r\n3. The slow prescription.\r\n\r\n4. The prompt prescription.\r\n\r\n5. The odd prescription.\r\n\r\n6. The even prescription.\r\n\r\n7. The double prescription.\r\n\r\nEach of these receipts being applied to particular cases, and the\r\ningredients that compose them being weighed with the most scrupulous\r\naccuracy.\r\n\r\nMedicine was taught in the imperial colleges of Pekin; but in every\r\ndistrict, a physician, who had studied six years, is appointed to instruct\r\nthe candidate for the profession, who was afterwards allowed to practise,\r\nwithout any further studies or examination; and it is said, that, in\r\ngeneral, the physician only receives his fee when the patient is cured.\r\nThis assertion, however, is very doubtful, as the country abounds in\r\nquacks, who, under such restrictions as to remuneration, would scarcely\r\nearn a livelihood. Another singular, but economical practice prevails\r\namongst them--a physician never pays a second visit to a patient unless he\r\nis sent for. Whatever may be the merits of Chinese practitioners both in\r\nmedicine and surgery, or their mode of receiving remuneration, it appears\r\nthat they are as much subject to animadversion as in other countries:--a\r\nmissionary having observed to a Chinese, that their medical men had\r\nconstantly recourse to fire in the shape of moxa, redhot iron, and burning\r\nneedles; he replied, \"Alas! you Europeans are carved with steel, while we\r\nare martyrized with hot iron; and I fear that in neither country will the\r\nfashion subside, since the operators do not feel the anguish they inflict,\r\nand are equally paid to torment us or to cure us!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS ON LIVING ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever ungrateful the discussion of this subject may be, since, in truth\r\nand justice, it must be considered with an unbiassed and unprejudiced\r\nmind, and elicit observations which may prove offensive to many, and\r\nabsurd to some, it is one of such moment on the score of humanity, that I\r\nundertake the task without hesitation or reluctance.\r\n\r\nIn support of the practice it has been urged, that mankind owes the most\r\nvaluable discoveries in the science of medicine and its collateral\r\nbranches to the vivisection of animals; that since the brute creation was\r\nintended for the use of our species, we could not apply them to a more\r\nimportant and justifiable purpose, than that of endeavouring to initiate\r\nourselves in those wonderful functions of nature, a knowledge of which\r\nwould give us a clearer insight of the mysterious machinery, and thereby\r\nthe better enable us to remedy their derangement when in a morbid state.\r\nIt has further been maintained, that when man to indulge his capricious\r\nappetites and his various amusements, tortures every creature that can\r\nminister to his depraved fancies or his unruly pleasures--he would be\r\nmore excusable, if not fully justifiable even in the eyes of the most\r\nsentient philanthropist, in submitting these creatures to smaller or\r\ngreater sufferings, if mankind could be ultimately benefited by this\r\nsacrifice of feeling. What, indeed, could be our commiseration when\r\nbeholding the agonies of a mangled dog or a cat, if the throes of his\r\nsufferings, and the incalculable pangs he endured, could restore a beloved\r\nchild to his disconsolate parents, or a sinking father to his helpless\r\nfamily. Moreover, is not man, from the very nature of his social position,\r\ncreated to suffer more than animals, not only from the many natural\r\ndiseases to which flesh is heir, but to the torturing wounds received on\r\nthe field of battle--the burning fevers of distant climes--the chances of\r\nwar, pestilence, and famine--all of which are aggravated by that power of\r\njudgment, that reflection and consciousness derivating from the possession\r\nof an immortal soul, which makes the future more horrible than the\r\npresent, however great its miseries may be. It has also been urged, that\r\nanimals in their savage state, undomesticated by the _humane_ interference\r\nof man, inflict upon each other injuries under which they linger and die\r\nin excruciating pain; and, therefore, when we submit them to similar\r\nagonies, we only fill up the intended measure of their destined\r\nsufferings.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to assert it, but all these allegations, I consider as not\r\nonly unsupported by facts and experience, but grounded on speculative\r\nsophistry; for, in regard to the injuries which animals in their wild\r\ncondition may inflict upon each other, they may be the result of the wise\r\nprovisions of the CREATOR, with which man, however presumptuous he be, has\r\nnothing to do, and even were it in his power to check their furious and\r\ndestructive propensities, it is more than likely, from what we daily\r\nwitness, that he would turn them to a profitable or a pleasurable account,\r\nas most probably, the sight of a combat between a wild elephant and a\r\nrhinoceros (provided the spectators were perfectly secure), would attract\r\na greater multitude, and _draw_ more money, than a dog-fight or a\r\nbull-bait--a tiger-hunt, were it not attended with some personal danger\r\nwhich requires courage, would prove more delectable than the pursuit of a\r\ntimid hare.\r\n\r\nBut I now come to a much more important consideration--the benefit to\r\nmankind that has occurred or that may be derived from such experiments.\r\nAnd here I must give as my most decided opinion, that if any such\r\nbeneficial results did arise from the inquiries, they were not\r\ncommensurate with the barbarity of the experiments; nay, I shall\r\nendeavour to show, that they are frequently more likely to deceive us, by\r\npropping up fallacious and tottering theories, than to shed any valuable\r\nlight on the subject of investigation.\r\n\r\nI readily admit that there does exist much analogy in the structure of man\r\nand certain animals in the higher grades of the creation; that the\r\nfunctions of respiration, digestion, absorption, locomotion, are to a\r\ncertain extent similar, and that experiments made to ascertain the\r\nmechanism of these functions (if I may so express myself), may tend, in\r\nsome measure, to teach us that which the inanimate corpse of man cannot\r\nexhibit; but, admitting to the full extent of argumentation, the analogy\r\nof these functions, I do maintain that the phenomena of life differ widely\r\nbetween man and animals, and the very nervous influences which we seek to\r\ndiscover are, in life, of a nature totally different. Were it not so,\r\nwould the senses of different animals, rendered more or less acute or\r\nobtuse according to their natural pursuits and protective habits, be so\r\nmaterially unequal? Indeed, the laws of nature that submit every creature\r\nto the immutable will of Providence are totally unlike; and each apparatus\r\nof life in divers beings seems to be especially calculated for the\r\nidentical race: what is poison to the one is an aliment to another; and\r\nthe vivid light which the eyes of one creature can bear, would produce\r\nblindness in another; the same effluvia which one animal would not notice,\r\nwould guide another over trackless wastes in search of friend or foe. I\r\ntherefore maintain, that the mere material examination of the living\r\norgans of animals can no more tend to illustrate their vital principle,\r\nthan the keenest anatomical labours can enable us to attain a knowledge of\r\nthe nature of our immortal and imperishable parts.\r\n\r\nI shall enter still more minutely into this subject. In the barbarous\r\nexperiments to which I allude, animals bearing the strongest resemblance\r\nto man (at least in their conformation, for Heaven, in its mercy, did not\r\ngift them with what we call _mind_) are usually selected amongst such as\r\npossess a heart with four cavities, and double lungs. The dog--the natural\r\ncompanion of man, his most faithful friend in weal and woe, the guardian\r\nof his couch and property, the protector of his infants, the only mourner\r\no'er the pauper's grave!--dogs, are in general selected for the scientific\r\nshambles; and this for obvious reasons,--they are more easily procured,\r\nand at a _cheaper rate_; moreover, they are more manageable and\r\nunresisting under the mangling scalpel. Well, thousands of these creatures\r\nhave been starved to death with butter, sugar, and oil, to prove that they\r\nmust die in all the aggravated pangs of hunger,--pangs producing ulcerated\r\neyes, blindness, staggers, parched up organs, unless their food contains\r\nazote. Will any one maintain, that a similar nourishment would produce\r\nsimilar effects on man? Certainly not. The one was created by nature to\r\nconsume animal substances highly azotized; the other, from the transition\r\nof life to which he is born to be exposed, is essentially polyphagous.\r\n\r\nThen, again, millions of animals have had their bones broken, scraped,\r\nbruised in every possible manner, to discover the process of the formation\r\nof bone, called _Osteogeny_: has a single fracture of a human limb been\r\nmore rapidly consolidated by these experiments, which fill hundreds of\r\npages in the works of Duhamel, Haller, Scarpa, and other physiologists?\r\nAnimals will digest substances that would kill a human being--have the\r\nexperiments in which their palpitating stomach and intestines have been\r\ntorn from them, lacerated, pricked, cut, separated from their surrounding\r\nvessels and nerves, increased our means of relieving the dyspepsia of the\r\nsensualist, the surfeit of the glutton, or the nausea of the dissolute? On\r\nthe other hand, the gin, the ardent spirits in which the drunkard wallows,\r\nwould soon destroy what we think proper to call a _brute_!\r\n\r\nIn many animals, moreover, there is a tenacity of life--highly convenient\r\nto the physiologist, since it enables him to prolong his experimental\r\ncruelties--which man does not possess; and we find the electric fluid\r\nacting much longer upon their muscles even after death, than on a human\r\nbody or its severed limbs.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be considered is the assertion of the advantages to be\r\nderived from contemplating the living viscera in a healthy state. Good\r\nGod! a healthy state!--what a mockery, what a perversion of language!\r\nBehold the dog, stolen from his master--(for theft is encouraged to supply\r\nthe man of science--and theft of the worst character, since it is of the\r\nmost cruel nature;--our goods, our money, may be restored, replaced by\r\nindustry, but what hand can restore the faithful companion of our\r\nsolitude, whose looks seem to study our thoughts! left us perhaps by the\r\nlost one of our heart, symbol of that fidelity which death alone\r\nabridged!) the poor animal hungry, chained up for days and nights pining\r\nfor his lost master, is led to the butchery. Still he looks up for\r\ncompassion to man, his natural protector, licks the very hand that grasps\r\nhim until his feeble limbs are lashed to the table! In vain he\r\nstruggles--in vain he expresses his sufferings and his fears in piteous\r\nhowls: a muzzle is buckled on to stifle his troublesome cries, and his\r\nconcentrated groans heave his agonized breast in convulsive throes, until\r\nthe scalpel is plunged in his helpless extended body! His blood flows in\r\ntorrents, his very heart is exposed to the torturer's searching hand, and\r\nnerves which experience anguish from a mere breath of air, are lacerated\r\nwith merciless ingenuity,--and this is a healthy state! The viscera\r\nexposed to atmospheric influence are already parched, and have lost their\r\nnatural colour, and not a single function is performed in normal\r\nregularity. One only effort is natural until vital power is exhausted--a\r\nvain instinctive resistance against his butchers!--The heart sickens at\r\nsuch scenes, when cruelty that would bid defiance to the savage's\r\nvindictive barbarity, sacrifices thousands of harmless beings at the\r\nshrine of vanity. For let the matter not be mistaken--these experiments\r\nare mostly made to give an appearance of verisimilitude to the most absurd\r\nand visionary doctrines; and if a proof were required of this assertion,\r\nit can be easily obtained by reading the works of various physiologists at\r\ndifferent periods, who all draw _different_ deductions from _similar_\r\nfacts. For when the mind labours under a certain impression, or a\r\nreputation is founded upon the support of a doctrine, these facts are\r\ndistorted with Procrustean skill to suit the views of the experimentalist.\r\n\r\nLet us, for instance, consider the subject of digestion, to ascertain the\r\nnature of which, thousands--millions of animals have been ripped up alive.\r\nThis practice has been attributed to _coction_, to _elixation_, to\r\n_fermentation_, to _putrefaction_, to _trituration_, to _maceration_, to\r\n_dissolution_, and to many other shades and shadows of similar theories;\r\nand were additional millions of living victims sacrificed in further\r\nscientific hecatombs, posterity may deem our present vain glorious\r\nphysiologists as ignorant of the matter as they might consider their\r\nnumerous predecessors in the same career of groping curiosity. Has the\r\ncruel extraction of the spleen from a thousand dogs to show that they\r\ncould live without that viscous, explained the nature of its functions, or\r\nenabled us more successfully to control its obstinate diseases?\r\n\r\nWe know nothing of the phenomena of life; all our functions are regulated\r\nby an allwise Power that sets at naught human presumption--and\r\nHippocrates justly called this harmonic organization a _concensus_, or a\r\ncircle, in which we could not discover the commencement or the end.\r\n\r\nThere does however exist one course of experiments which probably might\r\nprove beneficial to mankind. The search of antidotes to various poisons\r\nthat are too frequently administered by criminal hands; but here again\r\nexperiments fall short of our expectations, for these substances act\r\ndifferently upon different animals, and even to some the prussic acid in\r\nlarge doses may be given with impunity. But I affirm, and can prove it,\r\nthat in ninety-nine cases out of one hundred, in which such substances are\r\ngiven to animals, it is not with a view to discover antidotes, but to\r\nascertain, according to the unfortunate creature's species, size, and\r\ncondition, how long he can linger under the pangs of the poison, or what\r\nis the dose sufficient to occasion death. Of what benefit can it be to\r\nhumanity to know that thirty drops of hydro-cyanic acid destroys dogs and\r\ncats in the space of six, twelve, or fifteen minutes; that twenty-six\r\ndrops kill a rabbit in three minutes; that one drop introduced into the\r\nbill of a sparrow deprives it of life in eleven minutes; that a duck takes\r\nfifteen drops to put an end to its convulsive struggles; and that the\r\nexposing animals to the influence of hydro-cyanic acid gas destroys them\r\nin two, four, six, eight, and ten seconds? What benefit does society reap\r\nfrom the knowledge that, after the most excruciating suffering, a dog died\r\nin five hours after having taken half an ounce of tobacco, and that\r\nanother ill-fated canine victim in whose limbs tobacco had been\r\nintroduced, died of paralysis and in horrible convulsions in about an\r\nhour? Were antidotes sought in the thousands of similar cases that I could\r\nadduce? Certainly not--the experiments merely went to ascertain the power\r\nof the drug, and the only possible good that could have resulted from the\r\nbarbarous trial, was the appearance of the viscera after death; a fact\r\nthat one experiment could demonstrate as well as one thousand--but which\r\ncould be more effectually exhibited in human creatures who died from the\r\neffects of deleterious substances. In short, these experiments are nothing\r\nmore than cold calculations on the tenacity of life in various\r\nindividuals. Every one knows that arsenic and prussic acid destroy life,\r\nand surely such an assertion on the part of a lecturer to his pupils\r\nshould satisfy them on this head without having recourse to illustrations\r\nof the fact. In the case of supposed poison introduced into alimentary\r\nsubstances, and which are given to dogs to prove the criminal act, surely\r\nchemistry is not so little advanced in its boasted progress, not to be\r\nable to afford us a test of the presence of poison, without having\r\nrecourse to so savage an expedient.\r\n\r\nAnother most absurd argument has been upheld in favour of these\r\nexperiments in the presence of pupils, that of hardening their feelings in\r\nthe contemplation of acute sufferings. This assertion is worse than idle\r\nand absurd; many of our most able surgeons and anatomists have never\r\npractised these cruelties, and yet their nerves have not been unstrung\r\nduring the most fearful operations. With hands imbrued in blood I have\r\nperformed the arduous duties of my profession in fourteen battles, yet I\r\nnever could _witness_ these heartless exhibitions without disgust, and I\r\nam sorry to say contempt. I am aware that these sentiments have been\r\ncalled _puling_ professions of humanity; nay, that there are men and women\r\nwho would weep bitterly over the sufferings of a sick pet, while they\r\nwould view accumulated human misery unmoved. These are painful anomalies\r\narising too frequently in disappointed minds, when the cup of life has\r\nbeen imbittered by ingratitude, and the \"milk of human kindness\" curdled\r\nby deceit. These are not reasons to prevent us from censuring acts of\r\ncruelty, when they may be considered _useless_ in a scientific point of\r\nview, and _degrading_ to mankind in regard to private feelings. I can\r\nreadily believe that the best and the most humane of men, may be induced\r\nby an ardent desire to elucidate obscure parts of physiologic inquiry, to\r\ntry such experiments; but most undoubtedly--unless the object to be so\r\nattained was commensurate with the sacrifice and abnegation of humane\r\nsentiments, I should deeply lament their obduracy, and be inclined to\r\ndoubt their benevolence towards their fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\n  I would not enter on my list of friends\r\n  (Though graced with polish'd manners, and fine sense,\r\n  Yet wanting sensibility), the man\r\n  Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.\r\n  An inadvertent step may crush the snail\r\n  That crawls at evening in the public path;\r\n  But he that hath humanity forewarned\r\n  Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.\r\n\r\nIn fine, whenever it is not evident that such practices can benefit\r\nmankind and increase our means of reducing the sum of human misery--it is\r\na barbarous and criminal abuse of that power which the Creator has given\r\nus over the inferior grades of animated beings; and it is deeply to be\r\nlamented that no legislative measures can be adopted to restrain it, if it\r\ncannot be altogether prohibited. At any rate, professors alone should be\r\nallowed the \"_indulgence_,\" but in no instance should such\r\npseudo-scientific practices become a public exhibition or a student's\r\npastime. Brought up in early life, amidst all the complicated horrors of a\r\nrevolution, I have been sadly convinced that the contagion of CRUELTY is\r\nmuch more doubtless and active than that of PESTILENCE!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITING, BEAUFORT HOUSE STRAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] During these ten years the following works appeared:\r\n\r\n  Montesquieu--Esprit des Lois, 1748.\r\n  ---- Defense de l'Esprit des Lois, 1750.\r\n  Rousseau--Discours sur l'Influence des Sciences et des Lettres, 1750.\r\n  ---- Discours sur l'Inegalite des Conditions, 1754.\r\n  Voltaire--Essai sur les Moeurs et l'Esprit des nations, 1757.\r\n  Condillac--Essai sur l'Origine des Connaissances Humaines, 1746.\r\n  ---- Traite des Sensations, 1754.\r\n  Helvetius--De l'Esprit, 1758.\r\n\r\n[2] The _Homo diluvii testis_, the skeleton of which was described by\r\nScheuchzer, was considered by Cuvier to have belonged to a species of\r\nSalamander.\r\n\r\n[3] For the further illustration of this curious subject, Dr. Eliotson's\r\nvaluable notes on Blumenbach may be consulted to advantage.\r\n\r\n[4] The dream of Ertucules seems to have been connected with similar\r\nphantasies. \"I dreamed, venerable sir,\" said he to Edebales, \"that the\r\nbrightness of the moon did proceed from your bosom, and thence afterwards\r\ndid pass into mine: when it was thither come, there sprung up a tree from\r\nmy umbilic, which overshadowed at once many nations, mountains, and\r\nvalleys. From the root of this tree there issued waters sufficient to\r\nirrigate vines and gardens; and then both my dream and my sleep forsook\r\nme.\" Edebales after some pause thus answered: \"There will be born unto\r\nyou, my good friend, a son whose name shall be Osman; he shall wage many\r\nwars, and shall acquire victory and glory; and my daughter must be married\r\nto your son Osman, and she is the brightness which you saw come from my\r\nbosom into yours, and from both sprung up the tree.\"--_Lips. Marsil._\r\n\r\n[5] Vide the article \"Enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n[6] The choenix contained a pint.\r\n\r\n[7] These lines afford a convincing proof of the minute attention the\r\nancients paid to the phenomena of nature. Our poet had no doubt observed\r\nthe frequent effect of the application of cold to the surface of the body\r\nproducing a reaction in the circulation tending to overcome the noxious\r\nagent by a glow of heat, which in many instances of predisposition may\r\nassume a febrile character.\r\n\r\n[8] A Treatise on Insanity.\r\n\r\n[9] _Pallido il Sol_ and _Per quanto dolce amplasso_ of Hasse.\r\n\r\n[10] Much curious matter will be found in Mr. Nathan's valuable work upon\r\nmusic, entitled, \"_Musurgia vocalis_.\"\r\n\r\n[11] That animals are more frequently guided by the sense of smelling than\r\nby sight, is evident in those plants that shed a cadaverous effluvia,\r\nespecially the _arum dracunculus_ and the _stapelia variegata_ of the\r\nCape, which attract various insects that usually deposit their eggs in a\r\nstercoraceous or corrupt nidus. Here these insects have been deceived by\r\nvision, and imagined in their illusion that they had safely lodged their\r\nprogeny in carrion.\r\n\r\n[12] According to Aelian, the presence of this fish indicated the\r\napproaching overflow of the Nile.\r\n\r\n[13] The Irish, in their metaphorical language, give a corporeal form to\r\nfoul effluvia, and one of them assured me that he had a terrier who would\r\nalways cock up his tail and bark whenever he _saw_ a stink.\r\n\r\n[14] Diodorus, Strabo, and other ancient writers, state that the beer of\r\nthe Egyptians called _Zythus_ was scarcely inferior to wine. This beer was\r\nmade with barley, to which was added the lupin, the skirret, and the root\r\nof an Assyrian plant. We find the following in Columella:\r\n\r\n  \"Jam siser, Assyriaque venit quae semine radix\r\n  Sectaque praebetur madido satiata lupino,\r\n  Ut Pelusiaci proviset pocula zythi.\"\r\n\r\nThe vicinity of Pelusium was famed for this beverage and its lentils.\r\n\r\n[15] Diemerbrook states that, in the Plague of Nimeguen all those who were\r\ntaken ill about new and full moon rarely escaped.\r\n\r\n[16] Dr. Desgenettes, physician to the French army, in order to inspire\r\nconfidence among the troops, inoculated himself twice without experiencing\r\nany other consequence than a slight inflammation of the inoculated parts.\r\nSonnini mentions a Russian surgeon, who was a prisoner in Constantinople\r\nwith a number of his countrymen, and who took it into his head to\r\ninoculate his comrades, with a view of protecting them from the contagion;\r\nbut, unfortunately, two hundred of them died, and, fortunately perhaps for\r\nthe survivors, the operator himself died of his own treatment.\r\n\r\n[17] On this subject see what has been already said in the preceding\r\narticle of _Food, its use and abuse_, in Dr. Beaumont's experiments.\r\n\r\n[18] Otway.\r\n\r\n[19] Shaftesbury.\r\n\r\n[20] Oil is, however, a useful application to wounds in warm climates.\r\nDuring the retreat of our troops after the battle of Talavera, I found the\r\nwounds of many of our men, that had not been dressed for three or four\r\ndays, pullulating with maggots. This was not the case with the Spanish\r\nsoldiers, who, to prevent this annoyance (which was more terrific than\r\ndangerous), had poured olive oil upon their dressings. I invariably\r\nresorted to the same practice when I subsequently had to remove the\r\nwounded in hot weather.\r\n\r\n[21] A Hebrew proverb originating from a tradition that Abraham wore a\r\nprecious stone round his neck, which preserved him from disease, and which\r\ncured sickness when looked upon. When Abraham died, God placed this stone\r\nin the sun.\r\n\r\n[22] The ancients considered the spleen the seat of mirth, and the liver\r\nthe organ of love; hence their old proverb.\r\n\r\n[23] _Cordia Sebestena_; according to some, the _C. Myxa L._, a species of\r\nEgyptian date. It was formerly employed as a demulcent. A viscid black\r\nglue was also prepared from it, and exported in considerable quantities\r\nfrom Alexandria.\r\n\r\n[24] Quod Caeretani totum orbem vano quodam ac turpi superstitionum genere\r\nludificantes continuo peregrinantur, familia domi relicta.\r\n\r\n[25] Patin called it _l'impertinente nouveaute du siecle_.\r\n\r\n[26] The priesthood in thus stigmatizing the medical profession so soon as\r\nits practice ceased to be their exclusive privilege, displayed the same\r\nspirit of intolerance and thirst for omnipotent sway that characterized\r\ntheir anathemas on the drama when they no longer were the authors, actors,\r\nand managers of their own sacrilegious plays, which they called mysteries\r\nand moralities. Previously to the drama becoming the pursuit of laymen,\r\nthe monkish exhibitions had been so holy, that one of the popes granted a\r\npardon of one thousand days to every person who went to the plays\r\nperformed in the Whitsun week, beginning with a piece called \"The\r\nCreation,\" and ending the season with the performance of \"The General\r\nJudgment.\" In these representations the performers belonged to various\r\ncorporations, and acted under the direction of the clergy. \"The Creation\"\r\nwas performed by the _Drapers_,--\"The Deluge\" by the _Dyers_,--\"Abraham,\r\nMelchizedek, and Lot,\" by our friends the _Barbers_,--\"The Purification\"\r\nby the _Blacksmiths_,--\"The Last Supper\" by the _Bakers_,--\"The\r\nResurrection\" by the _Skinners_,--and \"The Ascension\" by the _Tailors_.\r\n\r\nThe following curious anecdotes are recorded in the description of a\r\nmystery performed at Veximel, near Metz, by the order of Conrad Bayer,\r\nbishop of the diocese. This play was called _The Passion_; and it appears\r\nthat by some mismanagement a priest by the name of Jean de Nicey, curate\r\nof Metrange, who played Judas, was nigh meeting with an untimely end; for\r\nhis neck had slipped and tightened the noose by which he was suspended to\r\nthe tree, and, had he not been cut down, he would have performed the part\r\nmost effectually.\r\n\r\nA play was acted in one of the principal cities in England by these\r\nclerical performers, representing the terrestrial Paradise, when Adam and\r\nEve made their appearance entirely naked.\r\n\r\n[27] Mr. J. A. St. John.\r\n\r\n[28] As this worthy never took off his cuirass, it may be shrewdly\r\nsuspected that his lashes were such as our old friend Sancho Panca\r\ninflicted on the tree.\r\n\r\n[29] The diseases to which the blood is subject was another ground upon\r\nwhich the vitality of this fluid was founded. The most remarkable kind of\r\ndiseased blood is that which occurs in cholera, where it is dark, nearly\r\nblack, even in the arteries. The cause of this phenomenon is by no means\r\ndecided. Dr. Thomson attributes it to a diseased condition of the blood,\r\nwhich unfits it for being duly arterialised. Dr. O'Shaughnessy denies the\r\nassertion, and proves that choleric blood can be rendered florid by the\r\nabsorption of oxygen. Dr. Stevens, in his treatise on the blood,\r\nattributes this dark appearance to the contagion of the malady, which\r\nthrows the fluids into a morbid state, the effect of which is the\r\ndiminution of the saline matter which the healthy blood contains. He\r\nobserved that in cholera-hospitals the blood of all the persons residing\r\nin them was also dark. It is, however, more than probable that this morbid\r\ncondition of the blood arises from the deranged state of the circulation,\r\nand may be attributed to a disease of the solids, which must invariably\r\naffect the fluids that they propel with more or less energy, flowing in a\r\nrapid current, or in a sluggish stream.\r\n\r\nI have fully illustrated this want of oxygen in the blood of cholera\r\npatients in a work I published in Bordeaux, in 1831, entitled\r\n_Observations sur la nature et le traitement du Cholera Morbus d'Europe et\r\nd'Asie_; and, from several experiments subsequently made on cholera\r\npatients, I feel convinced that the inspiration of oxygen gas will be\r\nultimately found the most energetic and effective practice in combating\r\nthis fearful disease.\r\n\r\nBy the experiments lately made by Dr. Donne of Paris, it has been found\r\nthat the globules of blood, when submitted to microscopic examination,\r\nvaried in magnitude according to the description of animals from which it\r\nwas drawn. In certain diseases, globules of pus have also been detected in\r\nthe sanguiferous stream. They were larger than those of the blood, and,\r\ninstead of being defined by a marginal line, were fringed on their\r\ncircumference, and their centre was striated with interwoven lines.\r\n\r\nThe same physiologist discovered animalcules in the pus of certain ulcers\r\nnot dissimilar in appearance to the _vibrio lineola_ of Mueller. Other\r\nanimalcules, which he has named the _tricomonas vaginalis_, were also\r\nfound in great number when the mucous membranes of the organ (whence the\r\nlatter part of their denomination was derived) were in a state of\r\ninflammation. These animalculi could not be detected in healthy mucus. The\r\nknowledge of this influence of inflammation may lead to many important\r\npractical results.\r\n\r\n[30] During the horrors of the French Revolution, various experiments were\r\nmade by Sue and other physiologists to ascertain if the bodies of the\r\nguillotined victims possessed sensibility. No conclusion, however, could\r\nbe elicited from these inquiries, which gave rise to many absurd tales,\r\nsuch as that the face of Charlotte Corday blushed when the executioner\r\nslapped it, as he held it out to the enraptured Parisians.\r\n\r\n[31] Organon, xxxii.\r\n\r\n[32] Op. cit. xxxi.\r\n\r\n[33] Ibid. xxxiii.\r\n\r\n[34] Op. cit. xxxviii.\r\n\r\n[35] Organon, xl.

The utmost virulence has as usual been\r\nresorted to, not only to impugn the doctrine, but to stigmatize its\r\nsupporters; while, on the other hand, the greatest ingenuity has been\r\ndisplayed to convince unbelievers, and to give to the many experiments\r\npractised for this purpose the semblance of undeniable facts. Baron\r\nDupotet's labours and publications have been submitted to the test of a\r\npublic investigation; while Dr. Elliotson and several other practitioners\r\nhave aided the practice apparently with success. It would be foreign to\r\nthe nature of this work to consider this matter more elaborately; it is\r\nnow before the tribunal of public opinion, whose decision we must await.\r\n\r\n[44] Inquiries concerning the Intellectual Powers, &c.\r\n\r\n[45] That serious accidents might have resulted from the use of hellebore\r\nis most likely, since various plants resembling it have been mistaken for\r\nit; chiefly the _adonis vernalis_, _trollius Europaeus_, _actaea spicata_,\r\n_astrantia major_, _veratrum album_, and the _aconitum neomontanum_, the\r\nlast of which is a most virulent poison.\r\n\r\n[46] The advocates of fasting have calculated that in one hundred and\r\nfifty-two hermits who had lived eleven thousand five hundred and\r\neighty-nine years, the average age was seventy three years and three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n[47] On this very curious subject the reader may consult the various\r\nstatistical works of Quetelet.\r\n\r\n[48] It is somewhat strange, but in the mountains of the South of Spain,\r\nthere does still exist a dance called _los Titanos_, in which the\r\nperformers raise their hands in threatening attitude against the heavens!\r\n\r\n[49] The matter of insensible perspiration is calculated at being daily\r\nequal weight to one half of the food.\r\n\r\n[50] Madder, when given to animals tinges the surface of their bones with\r\na red hue.\r\n\r\n[51] The life of J.
