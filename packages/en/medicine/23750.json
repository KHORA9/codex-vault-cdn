Her beauty-creed hangs not\r\nfrom rouge pots and bleaches, but suspends like a banner of truth from\r\nthe laws of wise, hygienic living. Her cheeks are tinted with the glow\r\nthat comes from good, well-circulated blood, her eyes are bright and\r\nlovely because her mind is so, and her complexion is transparent and\r\nsoft and velvety for the reason that the true art is known to her. The\r\nWoman Beautiful is all sincerity. She doesn't like to sail under false\r\ncolors and so insult old Dame Nature, whose kindnesses and benefits are\r\nso well meant and freely offered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       PAGE\r\n\r\nTHE COMPLEXION                            9\r\n    Expression                           14\r\n    Useless Beauty                       16\r\n    Washing the Face                     20\r\n    Facial Eruptions and Blackheads      23\r\n    Tan, Sunburn and Freckles            27\r\n    Complexion Powders                   32\r\n    Wrinkles                             35\r\n    Recipes for the Complexion           39\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE HAIR                         46\r\n    Dressing the Hair                    56\r\n    Superfluous Hair                     63\r\n    Recipes for the Hair                 65\r\n\r\nTHE HANDS                                68\r\n    Bathing the Hands                    71\r\n    Care of the Finger Nails             73\r\n    Recipes for the Hands                75\r\n\r\nTHE EYES                                 79\r\n    The Girl Who Cries                   83\r\n    The Eyelashes                        86\r\n    The Eyebrows                         86\r\n\r\nTHE TEETH                                88\r\n\r\nBATHING                                  93\r\n\r\nDIET                                    100\r\n\r\nSLEEP                                   109\r\n\r\nEXERCISE                                114\r\n\r\nSTOOPED SHOULDERS                       125\r\n\r\nBREATHING                               130\r\n\r\nMASSAGE                                 136\r\n\r\nDRESS                                   144\r\n\r\nTHE THIN GIRL                           149\r\n\r\nTHE PLUMP GIRL                          154\r\n\r\nTHE WORKING GIRL                        161\r\n\r\nTHE NERVOUS ONE                         167\r\n\r\nPERFUMES                                174\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Woman Beautiful\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE COMPLEXION\r\n\r\n    The bloom of opening flowers, unsullied beauty,\r\n    Softness and sweetest innocence she wears,\r\n    And looks like Nature in the world's first Spring.\r\n\r\n    --_Rowe._\r\n\r\n\r\nBad complexions cause more heartaches than crushed ambitions and cases\r\nof sudden poverty. The reason is plain. Ordinary troubles roll away\r\nfrom the mind of a cheery, energetic woman like water from a duck's\r\nback, but beauty worries--well! they have the most amazingly insistent\r\nway of sticking to one. You may say you won't think of them, but you do\r\njust the same.\r\n\r\nIt was always thus, and thus it always will be.\r\n\r\nDiogenes searched untiringly for an honest man--so they say. Woman,\r\nbless her dear, ambitious heart, seeks with unabating energy the ways\r\nand means of becoming beautiful.\r\n\r\nAfter all, they're not so hard to find when once the secret of it is\r\nknown. Like the keys and things rattling about in her undiscoverable\r\npocket, they're right with her. If she will but stop her fretting for a\r\nmoment, sit down and think, then gird on her armor and begin the\r\ntask--why, that's all that's needed.\r\n\r\nThere are three great rules for beauty. The first is diet, the second\r\nbathing, and the third exercise. All can be combined in the one word\r\nhealth. But, alas! how few of us have come into the understanding of\r\ncorrect living! It is woman's impulse--so I have found--to buy a jar of\r\ncream and expect a miracle to be worked on a bad complexion in one\r\nbrief night. How absurd, when the cause of the worry may be a bad\r\ndigestion, impure blood or general lack of vitality! One might just as\r\nwell expect a corn plaster to cure a bad case of pneumonia, or an eye\r\nlotion to remedy locomotor ataxia. The cream may struggle bravely and\r\nheal the little eruptions for a day or so, but how can it possibly\r\neffect a permanent cure when the cause flourishes like a blizzard at\r\nMedicine Hat or a steam radiator in the first warm days of April?\r\n\r\nCold cream, pure powders and certain harmless face washes are godsends\r\nto womankind, but they can't do everything! They have their\r\nlimitations, just like any other good thing. You may have a perfect\r\nparagon of a kitchen lady, whose angel food is more heavenly than\r\nfrapped snowflakes, but you can't really expect her to build you a\r\nfour-story house with little dofunnies on the cupolas. Of course not.\r\nAngel cake is her limit! And that's the way with those lovely liquids\r\nand things on your pretty spindle-legged dressing table. They can do a\r\ngood deal in the beautifying line, but they can't do everything. Give\r\nthem the help of perfect health and scrupulous cleanliness of the skin,\r\nand lo! what wonders they will work!\r\n\r\nThere is but one way--and it's so simple--of making oneself good to\r\nlook upon. Resolve to live hygienically. There is nothing in the world\r\nwhich works swifter toward a clear, glowing, fine-textured and\r\nbeautiful complexion than a simple, natural diet of grains and nuts and\r\nfruits. But you women--oh! it positively pains me to think of the\r\nbroiled lobsters, the deviled crabs with tartar sauce, the pickles, and\r\nthe conglomerate nightmare-lunches that you consume. And yet you're\r\nforever fussing over leathery skins, dark-circled eyes and a lack of\r\nrosy pink cheeks. Oh, woman! woman! why aren't you wise?\r\n\r\nHere are some rules. They're golden, too:\r\n\r\nEat with wisdom and good sense. That means to pension off the pie and\r\nits companion workers of physical woe.\r\n\r\nTake a tepid sponge bath every day, either upon arising in the morning\r\nor just before going to bed.\r\n\r\nLimit the hot scrubbings to one a week.\r\n\r\nExercise with regularity, and dress as a rational human being should.\r\n\r\nDrink three pints of pure, distilled water every day.\r\n\r\nSee that the bedroom is well ventilated, and don't heap up the pillows\r\nuntil you have a mountain range upon which to rest your poor, tired\r\nhead. A flat bed and a low pillow help toward a fine, straight figure\r\nand a good carriage.\r\n\r\nKeep your feet warm. Give those pretty round yellow silk garters to the\r\ngirl you hate, and invest in sensible hose supporters. If your\r\ncirculation is defective, wear wool stockings.\r\n\r\nDon't fret. Bear in mind what Sheridan said:\r\n\r\n    \"A night of fretful passion may consume\r\n    All that thou hast of beauty's gentle bloom;\r\n    And one distempered hour of sordid fear\r\n    Prints on thy brow the wrinkles of a year.\"\r\n\r\nThen rest. Don't, I beg of you, live on the ragged edge of your nerve\r\nforce. You need quiet, and all you can get of it. We victims of\r\ncivilization go through life at a breakneck gallop, and it's an immense\r\nmistake. Anyhow, those who know say so. And it sounds reasonable.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the complexion is only a small part toward the making\r\nof a beautiful woman. The hair must be kept sweet and clean and\r\nhealthy, and the teeth should be white and lovely. It was Rousseau, you\r\nknow, who said that no woman with good teeth could be ugly. Then the\r\nhands and nails must have proper attention. Deep breathing should be\r\npracticed daily and the body properly exercised. The carriage must be\r\ngraceful, the walk easy and without effort, the eyes bright, the\r\nexpression of the face cheerful and animated, the shoulders and head\r\nwell poised--but all these are different stories. There's a chapter in\r\neach one of them.\r\n\r\nAbove all, remember this one rule: Don't fret. Don't wear a look of\r\ntrouble and worry. Above everything else, remember those delicious\r\nlines of the immortal bard:\r\n\r\n    \"You have such a February face,\r\n    So full of frost, of storm, of cloudiness.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after remembering, refrain.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPRESSION.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things to remember in the cultivation of beauty is\r\nexpression. Who doesn't enjoy looking upon the young girl, with a\r\nbright, cheerful face, laughing eyes and all that? Everybody! And when\r\nthe grumpy lady or the whiney lady or the lady of woes trots in and\r\nsullies your near landscape, how do you feel? Just about as cheery as\r\nif she'd come to ask you to attend a funeral!\r\n\r\nMy dear girls, it doesn't matter if you have got a freckle or two, or\r\nif your nose does tilt up just a little too much, if you have a jolly,\r\nbright face people will call you pretty. You can count on that every\r\ntime. Good nature is a splendid beautifier. It brightens the eyes,\r\ndiscourages approaching wrinkles, and brings the apple blossom tints\r\ninto your cheeks.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to remember is this: Keep the mind active. There's\r\nnothing that will make a stolid, bovine face like a brain that isn't\r\nmade to get up and hustle. Don't sit around and read lovey-dovey novels\r\nor spend your time chatting with that stupid woman next door. Don't\r\nforget that life is short and there's not a moment to waste. When hubby\r\ndiscusses the question of expansion just pipe up and show him what you\r\nknow about it. Don't get into an argument with him, but let him see\r\nthat you read the papers and that you know a thing or two about passing\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThen don't stay cooped up in the house. Go out every day, if it's only\r\nto the corner market, and if you have to wade through snowdrifts. In\r\nshort, be up and doing. Don't dwell on past griefs or griefs that have\r\nnot yet arrived. Study is mental development, and mental development\r\nusually means a bright, pleasing expression.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSELESS BEAUTY.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, the man of brains and good sense--and he's the only\r\nman worth considering seriously--heartily despises the useless beauty.\r\nBy this I mean the woman who is always togged up and crimped and curled\r\nand looks as if she were not worth a row of pins except as a means of\r\nlivelihood to the modistes and the milliners and the hairdressers! The\r\nkind of beauty that I like is the sort that is active, doing,\r\nachieving, and working for some good. I believe, and fully too, that we\r\ncan all appear at our best and yet not look as if we were made of cut\r\nglass and Dresden that would crack or break or peel off if the lake\r\nwinds happened to take a fancy to blow our way. It may sound at a\r\nfrightful variance from the general preaching of the beauty teacher,\r\nbut--between you and me and the ice cream soda that we do not drink\r\nbecause it upsets our stomachs and ruins our complexions--I have simply\r\nno use whatever for the little girl who puts in the entire day (and\r\nhalf the night) fussing over her complexion, kinking her hair into\r\nseventeen little twists and curlycues, and dabbling lotions and things\r\non her nose till you can't rest. A certain amount of all this is\r\nnecessary, but don't give your life over to it. The waste of time is\r\nenough to make one want to be a Patagonian lady whose sole adornments\r\nin the beautifying line consist of a necklace of elephant's teeth and a\r\nfew Patagonian babies. When beautifying gets to the stage where one has\r\nno time for mental refurbishing it ceases to be beauty culture, and is\r\nsimply nonsense and loss of time.\r\n\r\nI can spot this class of women a block away. In my mind's eye I can see\r\nthem fussing and primping for hours before they are ready to don their\r\nstreet clothes and get down into the shopping district for the day's\r\nwork of pricing real lace and buying hairpins. And I always look around\r\nme and think of what a vast deal of work there is in this great, big,\r\nsorrowful old world, and what direful need there is of every one\r\npitching in and helping. To me, the useless woman is not a pretty\r\nwoman. She is an ornament, like the shepherdess on the mantelpiece or\r\nthe Spanish lady in the picture frame that hangs in the hallway. But\r\nthe other woman--the pretty and the useful woman--oh, but she is a\r\nsight to make old eyes grow young. Her gown is spotless, her hair all\r\nfluffy and lovely, her hat just at the correct angle. She steps along\r\nquickly, and you know by the very air about her that she is a worker,\r\nbe she of the smart set or of the humdrum life that toils and spins\r\nfrom morn till eve. Her eyebrows are not penciled, there is not a trace\r\nof rouge on her cheeks, but she is a healthy, well-built, active woman,\r\nwhose very appearance of neatness, sweetness and buoyancy tells all who\r\nsee her that she is a devotee of the daily bath, the dumb-bells, the\r\ncorrect and hygienic life.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour any woman should be able to take her plunge, coddle her\r\ncomplexion, dress her hair, manicure her nails, and attend to her\r\nteeth. If more time be needed, then the work is hardly worth the while,\r\nfor life is mighty short, my dears, and things that must be done pile\r\nup as the years go by. At night in fifteen minutes the face and hands\r\ncan be well washed, the hair brushed and combed and plaited, the teeth\r\nwell cleaned, and the complexion massaged with a little pure home-made\r\ncream. Of course, when the hair is shampooed or the nails manicured\r\nwith particular care, or the complexion subjected to a thorough\r\ncleansing by steam or massage, then more time is necessary.\r\n\r\nBut the gist of it all is this: Let us not spend so much time on the\r\nexterior effect that we will forget that which is most necessary to a\r\nbeautiful woman--the bright, interesting mind, the love of learning\r\nthings, the desire to be keeping apace with just a little bit of the\r\nworld's progress, and, best of all, teaching oneself how to live wisely\r\nand well. There never was--to my way of thinking--a brainless, silly\r\nwoman who was beautiful. It takes the light of intellect, the splendor\r\nof sweet womanliness, the glory of kindness, unselfishness and goodness\r\nto complete a perfect picture of \"the woman beautiful.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHING THE FACE.\r\n\r\nA good old stand-by query is about the simple matter of keeping one's\r\nface clean. There is no manner of doubt but that the hard water which\r\nwe have in the cities is responsible for many complexion ills, and that\r\nwe must not use it too generously upon our complexions if we long for\r\nthe colors of the rose and the lily in our cheeks. There is nothing in\r\nthe world so excellent as rain-water for the skin, but it's a great\r\nbulging problem as to how those of us who live in yardless flats and\r\napartments can manage to catch the elusive rain-drops. We might as well\r\nhope to lasso an electric car and hitch it onto our back porches for\r\nthe babies to play in, I think. When city people persist in telling\r\nothers to wash their faces in rain-water and thus secure beauty\r\neverlasting and glorious, I always have a mental picture of a frantic\r\nlady with golden locks a-streaming and her eyes brimful of wildness,\r\nrushing madly down the street with basins and things in her\r\noutstretched hands. It's all right if one has rain-barrels or cisterns,\r\nbut, after years of perspiring and nerve-sizzling flat hunting, I have\r\nfailed to find apartments provided with either of these luxuries. With\r\nfolding beds built in the sleeping apartments and steam radiators with\r\nreal steam in them, the landlords feel that their duties are done.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our muttons. Those who cannot have real rain-water\r\nshould use the harder brand sparingly on their faces. A thorough\r\nscrubbing at night before going to bed is an absolute necessity, lest\r\nthe pores of the skin become clogged with the smoke and dust of our\r\nmurky atmosphere. A little castile soap and a camel's-hair face brush\r\nwill assist the cleansing operation. To soften the water, I would\r\nadvise the following delightful lotion:\r\n\r\n    Four ounces of alcohol.\r\n    One ounce ammonia.\r\n    One dram oil of lavender.\r\n\r\n    One teaspoonful to a large basin of water is sufficient. To keep\r\n    the skin free from harshness and on unpleasant terms with wrinkles\r\n    and turkey tracks, a little pure cold cream should be used. If, in\r\n    the morning, the skin has not absorbed all the oils of the cream,\r\n    then wipe away with a cloth just slightly moistened. When at other\r\n    times the face needs washing, let me suggest that this toilet milk\r\n    be used. It is also excellent to apply before fluffing powder over\r\n    the cheeks:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Milk of violets:\r\n\r\n    Cucumber juice, boiled and cooled, one ounce.\r\n    Spirit of soap, one ounce.\r\n    Rose-water or orange flower water, four ounces.\r\n\r\n    By remembering that there are two tablespoonfuls to the ounce, the\r\n    measuring will not be at all difficult. If one wishes a stronger\r\n    perfume add a few drops of violet extract. Whether rose-water or\r\n    orange flower be used is left to one's own choice. They are equally\r\n    excellent for the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nFACIAL ERUPTIONS AND BLACKHEADS.\r\n\r\nWith most women, pimples are caused by indigestion or constipation.\r\nUnless the body throws off its waste material as it should, the\r\npoisonous matter will endeavor to find a way out through the pores of\r\nthe skin. The face, being the most sensitive, is usually the first part\r\nof the body to be afflicted. The remedy for facial blemishes is found\r\nin exercise, baths and a careful diet. And that reminds me that I would\r\nlike to remark right here that the combinations that girls and women\r\nget when they order lunches are appalling enough to raise the hair\r\nright off one's head, most particularly if one has any idea at all of\r\nthe general rules of hygiene and health.\r\n\r\nIt is just as easy to put beautifying foods into your stomach if you\r\nwill but once make up your mind to it. And what a host of trouble it\r\nwill save you! Not only in cosmetics, but doctor bills. What you eat is\r\nthe fuel that keeps the engine of life going. Good food makes good\r\nstrong muscles, pure blood and a fair, healthy, firm skin. If there are\r\ntroublesome little blotches on your face then mend your eating ways,\r\neven though it breaks your heart to give up those awful and\r\nindigestible dainties that you dote on so religiously. In place of the\r\npastries and the sweets and the pickles and the highly spiced dishes,\r\nsubstitute fruit and vegetables. Save all those nickels and dimes that\r\nyou invest in ice cream soda, and instead exchange them for lemons and\r\noranges that will help drive away the unsightly pimples and red\r\nblemishes. If possible, make your entire breakfast of fruit, either\r\ncooked or raw. If the apples and oranges and peaches and pears do not\r\nmake active the digestive organs, then go to a reliable druggist and\r\nhave this harmless and excellent prescription filled:\r\n\r\n    Extract of dandelion, one dram.\r\n    Powdered rhubarb, q. s.\r\n\r\n    Divide into three and one-half grain pills and take one every\r\n    night, or oftener if necessary.\r\n\r\nA state of nervousness will ofttimes bring a heart-wringing crop of\r\neruptions to the surface of the skin, and this condition is best\r\nremedied by plenty of baths, lots of fresh air, exercise, and a stiff\r\nbut cheerful determination to brace up and not have any nerves--which,\r\nby the way, is much easier said than done, as most of us know to our\r\nsorrow.\r\n\r\nNo matter of what order the facial eruptions may be, they must be\r\ntreated with the greatest gentleness possible. There is nothing in\r\nthe world worse than rubbing them with a coarse towel, a proceeding\r\nstrongly advised by the old-fashioned ones who--bless their hearts--are\r\nso likely to stick to old-timey notions till the cows come home, no\r\nmatter what arguments may be brought up to convince them of their\r\nmistaken views.\r\n\r\nPimples must never be irritated. Breaking or bruising the skin only\r\nadds to its diseased condition and general irritation. If the\r\ncomplexion is unsightly with red blotches, a solution of boric acid in\r\nboiling water, used warm, will be an effective lotion. Its application\r\nshould, of course, be combined with proper living as laid out above,\r\ncare being taken as to diet, exercise and the tepid daily bath. A good\r\ncold cream should also be used. I have been told by many that\r\ncontinuous applications of creme marquise had done away with pimples\r\nand blackheads, and it is frequently found that nothing more than a\r\nsensible diet and some simple pure face cosmetic is needed. When the\r\nskin is merely inflamed--that is, red of color and very tender, there\r\nis nothing better than a soothing cream like this. Listerine, witch\r\nhazel and eau de cologne are all good as external lotions for pimples.\r\nA paste of sulphur and spirits of camphor, which should be put on at\r\nnight and washed off the following morning, will do good work, provided\r\nthe beauty patient knows the laws of health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. OGDEN ARMOUR]\r\n\r\nWhen there are both blackheads and pimples the latter must first be\r\ngotten rid of. When the skin is perfectly free of these, then begin\r\nwith a camel's hair face-scrubbing brush to do away with the\r\nblackheads. Wash the face thoroughly with the brush every night just\r\nbefore going to bed, using warm water and pure castile soap. If the\r\nblackheads are very bad add alcohol to the water. That is very\r\ncleansing, but as it is also drying, a face cream must be smeared on\r\nimmediately after the face is rinsed and wiped. For some days it may\r\nseem that the pores are large and coarse and open, but they are simply\r\nundergoing a cleansing process that in the end will bring a lovely\r\nwhite, perfect skin. Whenever I hear women say that they never wash\r\ntheir faces, but use a cream instead, I always wonder if they really\r\nfeel clean. I am sure I would not. Fancy the state of our hands were we\r\nnever to wash them! And the face, having more oil glands, is in still\r\ngreater need of soap and water. However, let me say right here that no\r\nsoap at all is better than a cheap scented soap, and unless the very\r\nbest and purest soaps can be had it is much more desirable to\r\nsubstitute almond meal or something of the sort. Treatment for\r\nblackheads calls for the same care of the health as does treatment for\r\npimples.\r\n\r\n\r\nTAN, SUNBURN AND FRECKLES.\r\n\r\nTan, like borrowing friends, and various other afflictions, is awfully\r\neasy to get, but really more than passing difficult to remove. It is\r\ndelightful to sit on a big bowlder that dots a great, lovely, sandy\r\nwaste and watch your hands gradually turn from their customary\r\nwhiteness to a deep burnt orange. One has to have something to show for\r\na trip out of town, one thinks, else the doubting Thomases will arise\r\nand give vent to suspicions that one has been merely concealing oneself\r\nin an attic or back bedroom. It is pleasant, too, to go fishing, with a\r\ndainty, absurd little hat that, although it looks pretty, is about as\r\nuseful as would be a beaten biscuit pinned to one's tresses. You feel\r\nyour nose becoming unusually warm, and it begins to tingle and smart as\r\nif the pores were filling up with hot sand. All of which is quite in\r\nkeeping with summer-resort existence, and you are as proud as Lucifer\r\nwhen you trail back to town to show this cerise-tinted evidence of your\r\nouting.\r\n\r\nBut the friends who you thought would envy you giggle and smirk and\r\nnudge each other and make suggestions that are supposed to be\r\nmirth-compelling. And then and there you decide to do differently next\r\nsummer. A sunburned nose may be a treasurable possession away from\r\ntown, but back among the hosts of the city it is a different matter.\r\nMore than that, it is an affliction.\r\n\r\nIf the weeks at the seashore or the lakes would only brown the summer\r\ngirl it would not matter so much. But instead of making the skin a\r\nbeautiful, poetical olive tint, it usually turns it to a hue which is\r\nbest compared to the flaunting colors of the auctioneer's emblem. If\r\nthe girl is reckless, if she runs here and there without a hat, and\r\ngives never a moment to the care of her skin, her own mother is not\r\nlikely to recognize her unless the summer girl soon repents and mends\r\nher ways.\r\n\r\nWhat mischief Old Sol cannot do, the brisk winds will contribute. The\r\nresult is usually a red-eyed, red-nosed, flakey-skinned little woman,\r\nwhom one would never suspect of having been rollicking through a few\r\nweeks of midsummer joys. If her ears are not blistered, her nose is,\r\nand if her complexion is not harsh and rough from lack of care, it is\r\nbespeckled with freckles and covered with a deep layer of golden brown\r\ntan that has distributed itself like patches on a crazy quilt.\r\n\r\nThere is not one woman in forty who can afford to ignore the ordinary\r\nprecautions for preserving her complexion during the summer months.\r\n\r\nA parasol is the first necessity. A white gauze veil is another,\r\nalthough this can be dispensed with if the skin is not particularly\r\nsensitive to sun and wind. Never, under any circumstances, must you\r\nbathe your face in soap and water before going out of door or just\r\nafter coming in. This habit will make the freckles pop out in fine\r\norder. After coming in from a tramp or a fishing party bathe the face\r\nat once in half a cupful of sweet milk in which a pinch of soda has\r\nbeen dissolved. If this is inconvenient, as it often is when one is a\r\nhotel guest and not a cottager, then use a good face cream. Strong\r\nsoaps containing an excess of alkali are bad enough at any time, but\r\nduring the hot weather they are particularly trying to almost any skin.\r\nToo much care cannot be taken to get proper soaps.\r\n\r\nThe following sedative lotion applied to the face will prevent its\r\ntanning or freckling to any extent, that is, if one takes proper care\r\nof one's skin:\r\n\r\n    Distilled witch hazel, 3 ounces.\r\n    Prepared cucumber juice, 3 ounces.\r\n    Rose-water, 1-1/2 ounces.\r\n    Essence white rose, 1-1/2 ounces.\r\n    Simple tincture of benzoin, one-half ounce.\r\n\r\n    After rubbing this into the skin with the finger tips and letting\r\n    the cuticle absorb it well, apply a pure vegetable powder.\r\n\r\nWhen the face becomes sunburned apply plenty of cold cream. But be sure\r\nthat it is your own home-made cream, else you may be putting lard or\r\nsomething else on your face, which, in a most amazing short time, will\r\nproduce a thrifty growth of tiny, fine hairs. And then you will wish\r\nyou had never lived to see the coming of the \"happy summertime.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, to remove freckles, quickly apply lemon juice with a camel's\r\nhair complexion brush. Let the juice dry in and massage with creme\r\nmarquise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLEXION POWDERS.\r\n\r\nWhenever women fail for congenial topics of dispute they can always\r\nfall back on the old topic of the best face-powder.\r\n\r\n\"I have used that delightful velvety 'Blush Rose' for years and years,\"\r\nsays Mrs. Lovely, \"and I think it is simply fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blush Rose?\" shrieks Mrs. Pretty. \"Why, I wouldn't use that for\r\na-an-any-thing! My husband's brother-in-law, who worked in a drug\r\nstore, once told me that 'Blush Rose' had lead and bismuth and ever so\r\nmany other dreadful, awful things in it. Now, I dote on 'Velvety\r\nCarnation.' I know that that is perfectly pure. And it sticks just like\r\nyour husband's relatives--simply never lets go!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Velvety Carnation!'\" repeats Mrs. Lovely. \"You poor child. I don't\r\nwonder that you have such a time with your skin--\" And so on until both\r\ncharming disputants march airily away, each deciding that the other\r\nwill soon be in her grave if such foolishness in the choice of a face\r\npowder is continued.\r\n\r\nWomen need not discuss finances or peace policies. They have their own\r\nlittle face-powder question that is good for all time to come, no\r\nmatter whether we all go and settle in the Philippines or hand these\r\ninteresting islands back to Spain with a \"much-obliged, thank you.\" I\r\nhave often thought how thankful we should all be that we are not\r\nDahomey ladies, who have no opportunities for these pleasant little\r\narguments. We may have to put up with a good many discomforts in our\r\nlife of civilization, but we don't miss quite everything in the way of\r\njoys.\r\n\r\nThe formula for face powder which I am about to give is not only\r\nperfectly harmless, but of exceptional medicinal qualities. Nothing is\r\nbetter for an irritated skin than boracic acid, so the girl with facial\r\neruptions can feel perfectly safe in using this powder. Oxide of zinc,\r\nin the quantity given, can do no possible injury; many of the\r\nmanufactured preparations being made almost entirely of this ingredient.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Poudre des Fees (Fairy Powder):\r\n\r\n    1 ounce Lubin's rice powder.\r\n    3 ounces best, purest oxide of zinc.\r\n    1/2 ounce carbonate of magnesia, finely powdered.\r\n    20 grains boracic acid.\r\n    2 drops attar of rose.\r\n\r\n    When purchasing your ingredients ask the druggist to powder each\r\n    separately in a mortar. First put your rice powder through a fine\r\n    sieve, and then through bolting cloth. Do the same thing with the\r\n    oxide of zinc, the magnesia and the boracic acid before adding them\r\n    to the rice powder. When all are combined put twice through bolting\r\n    cloth. After each sifting throw away any tiny particles that\r\n    remain. It is very necessary that all the ingredients be made fine\r\n    and soft and fluffy. Add the oil of rose last. By putting in the\r\n    tiniest suggestion of finely powdered carmine you can get the cream\r\n    powder, and by putting in still more you will have the rose or pink\r\n    tint. While blonds, with clear, perfect skins, can use either the\r\n    white or the pink very nicely, cream is the more acceptable color\r\n    for brunettes.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Consuelo Powder:\r\n\r\n    5 ounces of talcum.\r\n    5 ounces of rice flour.\r\n    2-1/2 ounces of the best zinc oxide.\r\n    2 drops each of oils of bergamot, ylang-ylang and neroli.\r\n\r\n    The three main ingredients should be sifted over and over again,\r\n    and if flesh color is desired, a little carmine must be added, the\r\n    sifting continuing. Then add the perfumes and sift again, so as to\r\n    avoid any lumps.\r\n\r\nA formula for violet powder is given in the chapter on perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nWRINKLES.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter whether or not you are afflicted with wrinkles, it's\r\nan excellent thing to give them some attention. Freckles are bothersome\r\nand provoking, and red noses make us as cross as black cats, but\r\nwrinkles!--they are the worst of all, for with them comes the sickening\r\nrealization that the freshness of one's complexion is beginning to\r\nfade, and that youth itself is slipping away.\r\n\r\nIt is before the lines really appear that they should be considered,\r\nfor then they're much more easily managed than when they--with their\r\nsisters and their cousins and their aunts, to say nothing of grandmas\r\nand babies--settle down for a nice long stay. Wrinkles are worse than\r\nbogie men, and \"they'll git you if yo' don't watch out!\"\r\n\r\nWrinkles are unnecessary evils--anyway, until one gets to be a hundred\r\nor so. That is, if you are so lucky as not to have troubles enough to\r\nkeep you awake six nights out of seven, which seems to be the case with\r\nmost people these days. Even then perhaps you can deceive yourself into\r\nbelieving that life is one big, lovely, roseate dream after all. Worry\r\nis a paragon of a wrinkle-maker. And, by the way, did you ever know\r\nwhy?\r\n\r\nIt is not so much for the reason that screwing up the face traces lines\r\nand seams in the skin as it is because the fretting upsets the stomach.\r\nIt has a most depressing effect on that hyper-sensitive organ. Haven't\r\nyou often noticed what a finicky, doleful sort of an appetite you have\r\nwhenever you are indulging in a fit of the blues? The physiological\r\nexplanation is the very close alliance of the great sympathetic nerves,\r\nwhich make up a little telegraph line more perfect and complete than\r\nany yet constructed by man. The poor, worn brain is fagged and tired.\r\nThis fact is immediately communicated to the stomach, which, in true\r\nsisterly fashion, mopes and sulks out of sheer sympathy.\r\n\r\nThen, of course, with an unruly digestion, all sorts of complications\r\nbegin. The eyes get dull, the face thin and sallow, the complexion bad,\r\nand the flesh flabby. At that stage the wrinkles, with their aforesaid\r\nrelatives, sail in upon the scene. And there you are! And--ten chances\r\nto one--it's a cheerful time you'll have getting rid of them.\r\n\r\nThat's why I say you must take them in hand before they arrive, and\r\ndole out discouragement to them by correct living and the necessary\r\nfacial massage.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the face wrinkles exactly for the same reason and by the\r\nsame mechanism that the skin of an apple wrinkles. The pulp of the\r\nfruit under the skin begins to shrink and contract as the juices dry\r\nup, and, quite naturally, the skin which was once taut and smooth, now\r\nbeing much too large for the contents, puckers up and lays itself in\r\ntiny folds. It's the same way with the skin of the face. When the\r\nsubcutaneous fat of the cheeks and brow--which, when we are young and\r\nplump and rosy, is abundant--begins to be absorbed and to gradually\r\ndisappear, then the cuticle straightway starts in to shrivel and fall\r\ninto minute lines.\r\n\r\nSo it is wisdom to anticipate the coming of wrinkles and lay plans to\r\nward them off. Live after strict rules of hygiene, as told in the\r\nchapters on Exercise, Baths, Sleep, Diet, and Dress. Have a tonic\r\nmethod of living. Invigorate your muscles and the skin of your body by\r\nsponge baths and brisk drying with a coarse bath towel. Friction is a\r\ngreat beautifier. Eat only that food which is going to do you some\r\ngood, and take your exercise with regularity. Add to this a happy,\r\nhopeful disposition of mind and a big fat jar of pure, properly-made\r\nskin food, then read the chapter on massage and follow the instructions\r\ngiven therein. If any wrinkles or crow's feet come and lodge with you\r\nafter that, then I'll take off my hat to their perseverance.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR THE COMPLEXION.\r\n\r\nIn compounding face creams one cannot be too careful and painstaking.\r\nIt is much like preparing a salad or a charlotte russe, either of which\r\ncan be utterly ruined by lack of care--or too much fussing. The creme\r\nmarquise is especially difficult for the woman who tumbles things\r\ntogether in a haphazard fashion. Unless compounded just so carefully,\r\nit will be likely to crumble, but when done according to directions it\r\nmakes a cosmetic that is absolutely unrivaled. The other creams which\r\nfollow this formula are more easily made for the reason that they\r\ncontain less fats and are therefore less apt to separate from the\r\nrose-water. The creme marquise is a whiter, harder preparation than any\r\nof the others.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Creme Marquise:\r\n\r\n    1/4 ounce of white wax.\r\n    2-1/2 ounces of spermaceti.\r\n    2-1/2 ounces of oil of sweet almonds.\r\n    1-1/2 ounces of rose-water.\r\n    1 drop attar of rose.\r\n\r\n    Shave the wax and spermaceti, and melt in a porcelain kettle. Add\r\n    the almond oil and heat slightly, but do not let boil. Remove from\r\n    the stove and add the rose-water, to which the perfume has been\r\n    added. Beat until creamy, and put in jars. Cease beating before the\r\n    mass becomes really hard. Be sure that your druggist weighs the wax\r\n    carefully, for too much of this ingredient will spoil the creme by\r\n    making it too firm. This delightful preparation should be applied\r\n    immediately after washing the face, but can be used at any time. It\r\n    is absolutely harmless. Get the best materials--and see that your\r\n    almond oil is the real thing instead of a cheap imitation, which\r\n    acts almost as poison to the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Strawberry Cream:\r\n\r\n    White wax, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    Spermaceti, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    Sweet almond oil, 2-1/2 ounces.\r\n    Strawberry juice, 3/4 of an ounce.\r\n    Benzoin, 3 drops.\r\n\r\n    Take large fresh berries. Wash and drain thoroughly. Macerate and\r\n    strain the juice through a piece of muslin. Heat the white wax, the\r\n    spermaceti and the oil of almonds. Remove from the fire and add the\r\n    strawberry juice very quickly. Beat briskly till fluffy, adding the\r\n    three drops of benzoin just as the mixture begins to cool. Put in\r\n    jars and keep in a very cool place. This quantity will fill a\r\n    three-ounce jar. Apply every night as a cold cream. This is\r\n    particularly excellent for sunburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Orange Flower Skin Food:\r\n\r\n    Spermaceti, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    White wax, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    Sweet almond oil, 2 ounces.\r\n    Lanoline, 1 ounce.\r\n    Cocoanut oil, 1 ounce.\r\n    Tincture benzoin, 3 drops.\r\n    Orange flower water, 1 ounce.\r\n\r\n    Melt the first five ingredients in a porcelain kettle. Take from\r\n    the fire, and add the benzoin and the orange flower water, fluffing\r\n    it with an egg-beater till cold. This recipe will make five ounces,\r\n    quite enough to prepare at one time. For those who dislike oily\r\n    creams it will be found delightful, as the skin absorbs it. The\r\n    mission of the skin food is to do away with wrinkles. Massage must,\r\n    of course, accompany its application. For hollow cheeks or dry,\r\n    rough skin it is unexcelled. Its fattening qualities plumpen the\r\n    tissues and so raise the lines of the face and gradually obliterate\r\n    them.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Clover Cream:\r\n\r\n    Spermaceti, 1 ounce.\r\n    White wax, 1 ounce.\r\n    Oil sweet almonds, 5 ounces.\r\n    Rose-water, 1-3/5 ounces.\r\n    Powdered borax, 20 grains.\r\n    Essence of clover, 5 drops.\r\n\r\n    Dissolve the borax in the rose-water and add the essence of clover.\r\n    Melt the white wax, the spermaceti and the oil of almonds, using a\r\n    porcelain kettle, as tin or iron is injurious to the oils. When\r\n    melted remove from the heat and add the rose-water (all at once).\r\n    Then beat quickly with an egg-beater until the mixture is cold and\r\n    firm. It is impossible for the rose-water to separate from the oils\r\n    if directions are carefully followed. The recipe given above will\r\n    fill an eight-ounce jar, so perhaps one-half the quantity should be\r\n    tried at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Camphor Cold Cream: Take one-half ounce each of spermaceti and\r\n    white wax, melt and add three and one-fourth ounces of oil of sweet\r\n    almonds, then add one-fourth ounce of camphor, broken into small\r\n    pieces, and stir until dissolved. Then pour in one and one-half\r\n    ounces of distilled water in which fifteen grains of borax have\r\n    been dissolved. Stir until well mixed and beginning to thicken,\r\n    then add four drops oil of rose, one drop oil of rose geranium, one\r\n    drop oil of ylang-ylang, two drops tincture of musk, and two drops\r\n    tincture of civet. Continue to beat until cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cold Cream:\r\n\r\n    White wax, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    Spermaceti, 1/2 ounce.\r\n    Orange flower water, 2 ounces.\r\n    Almond oil, 4 ounces.\r\n\r\n    Melt all together gently and pour into cups to cool. When cold pour\r\n    off the water, remelt, and pour into jars to keep.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oatmeal Lotion:\r\n\r\n    Two tablespoonfuls fine oatmeal.\r\n\r\n    Boil and strain. When cold add\r\n\r\n    One dessertspoonful of wine (white Rhine preferred), and the juice\r\n    of one lemon.\r\n\r\n    Fluff over the face before going to bed, not wiping it all away.\r\n    This is excellent for sallow complexion.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Rose Toilet Vinegar: This toilet vinegar is made by taking one\r\n    ounce of dried rose leaves, pouring over them half a pint of white\r\n    wine vinegar, and letting stand for two weeks. Then strain,\r\n    throwing rose leaves away, and add half a pint of rose-water. It\r\n    can be used either pure or diluted, and is especially good for an\r\n    oily skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lavender Lotion (to soften water):\r\n\r\n    4 ounces of alcohol.\r\n    1 ounce of ammonia.\r\n    1 dram oil of lavender.\r\n\r\n    Add one teaspoonful to two quarts of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A stringent Wash: Place in a half-pint bottle one ounce of cucumber\r\n    juice, half fill bottle with elderflower water, and add two\r\n    tablespoonfuls of eau de cologne. Shake well and add very slowly\r\n    one-half ounce simple tincture of benzoin, shaking the mixture now\r\n    and then. Fill bottle with elderflower water.\r\n\r\n    This is very whitening, but its best mission is that of making\r\n    large, open pores less noticeable and disfiguring.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Cucumber Milk:\r\n\r\n    Oil of sweet almonds, 2 ounces.\r\n    Fresh cucumber juice, 10 ounces.\r\n    White castile soap, 1/4 ounce.\r\n    Essence of cucumbers, 3 ounces.\r\n    Tincture of benzoin, 38 drops.\r\n\r\n    Get the juice by slicing the cucumbers, unpeeled, boiling in a\r\n    little water and straining carefully. The essence is made by mixing\r\n    the juice with equal parts of alcohol. First dissolve the soap in\r\n    the essence, add the juice, then the sweet almond oil very slowly,\r\n    and finally the benzoin. Shake well for half an hour if possible.\r\n    This is a most effective remedy for tan and sunburn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CARE OF THE HAIR\r\n\r\n    Her luxuriant hair--it was like the sweep of a swift wing in\r\n    visions.--_Willis._\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty hair can redeem a whole host of irregular features. With little\r\nwaves and kinks, and clinging, cunning tendrils that lie close to the\r\ntemples, a \"crown of glory\" will transform an ordinarily plain woman\r\ninto one passably good to look upon. If you doubt this, just create a\r\nmental picture of yourself in the last stages of a shampoo! Isn't it\r\nawful? The damp, straight locks hanging in one's eyes, and the long,\r\nfluffy strands, that aren't fluffy at all but as unwavy as a shower\r\nbouquet of macaroni, and the tag ends and whisps sprouting out here and\r\nthere like a box full of paint brushes six ways for Sundays--well, one\r\nis always mentally thankful at such times that one's \"dearest and best\"\r\nisn't anywhere around to behold the horrible sight. But after awhile\r\nthe long, damp tresses are patted and fussed over until they are dry,\r\nand then they're combed out and curled up and kinked and twisted, and,\r\noh, my countrymen, what a change is there! The harsh lines of the mouth\r\nare softened, the eyes look bright and pretty, the complexion comes out\r\nin all its sweetness like the glorious rainbow of a week ago.\r\n\r\nIt makes all the difference in the world!\r\n\r\nBut of course you will straightway exclaim: \"That's all right to say\r\nabout those lucky girls who have nice long tresses, but how about us\r\npoor mortals whose 'crown' consists of eighteen hairs of eighteen\r\ndifferent lengths, and all of them falling out as fast as they can?\" To\r\nbe sure, conditions do--once in a while--alter cases. But I claim, and\r\nalways will claim--till the day comes when beauty matters won't matter\r\nat all--that every woman can have pretty hair if she will take the time\r\nand use the good, uncommon sense which seems necessary to acquire it.\r\n\r\nYou know, and I know, and every other woman knows, that women treat\r\ntheir hair as they treat their watches--to unpardonable abuse. Of\r\ncourse, one's hair isn't dropped on the sidewalk or prodded with\r\nstickpins until the mainspring breaks, but it is subjected to even\r\ndeeper and more trying insults. One night, when the little woman is in\r\na real good, amiable mood, the tresses are carefully taken down,\r\nbrushed, doctored with a nice \"smelly\" tonic, patted caressingly and\r\ngently plaited in nice little braids. The next night it is crimped\r\nuntil each individual hair has acute curvature of the spine; then it is\r\nburned off in chunks and triangles and squares; it is yanked out by the\r\nhandfuls, it is wadded and twisted and tugged at and built up into an\r\nEiffel tower, and--after a few hours of such torture--the little woman\r\ntakes out the sixty odd hairpins, shakes it loose, gets every hair into\r\na three-ply tangle of its own, and then hops into bed! When she gets up\r\nin the morning she pulls out and combs out more hair than she can make\r\ngrow in after seven months' careful treatment.\r\n\r\nI tell you that is the one great trouble with women. They will not\r\nstick to one particular method. If they feel like fussing and coddling\r\nthey will, but if they're tired or cross or in a hurry to get to sleep,\r\nwell, they just let their hair take care of itself. One's tresses need\r\nregular care just as do plants or babies or people. Make up your mind\r\nthat you have hit upon the best way to treat your hair and then stick\r\nto it, no matter whether school keeps or not.\r\n\r\nTo disentangle the hair use only a coarse comb, being sure that every\r\ntooth is smooth and firm, so that it will not tear or split the silky\r\nfibers. The fine comb is a thing of horror, and has no place upon the\r\ndressing-table. It irritates the scalp, bringing forth a prosperity\r\nyear crop of dandruff and attendant unhappiness. Added to this, it\r\nsplits the hair shafts and injures the roots.\r\n\r\nBrushing the hair is sadly overestimated. A dozen or two strong strokes\r\neach night will remove the day's dust and dirt, will promote\r\ncirculation and sweep out flaky matter. The brushing must be done\r\nfirmly but gently, and not with the violent methods of a carpet\r\nsweeping machine. Really, it is simply appalling the way some women\r\ndress their hair. A few tugs and yanks with a comb of uneven, unsmooth\r\nteeth, a scattering brushing back of scolding locks, some singes here\r\nand there with a red-hot curling iron, a twist, a roll, a pat and the\r\napplication of a dozen hairpins, and the hairdressing for the day is\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nInstead, the comb should be used with gentleness, not dug into the\r\nscalp, as is the practice of some mistaken beskirted mortals. There is\r\nan old saying to this effect: \"Wash the scalp, but not the hair; comb\r\nthe hair, but not the scalp,\" which saying, I leave to you, is good\r\nenough to paste in one's hat--or rather on the back of one's hair\r\nbrush.\r\n\r\nAfter the brushing each night it is an excellent plan to part the hair\r\ninto small strands and wipe off with a cloth slightly moistened. This\r\nis a sort of sponge bath which tones and invigorates the growth.\r\n\r\nCombs should never be washed, but cleaned with a stout thread. Brushes,\r\nhowever, must have frequent washings in warm ammonia water, taking care\r\nto keep the backs dry. They should never be put in the sunlight when\r\nwet, but left to dry in an open window.\r\n\r\nCurling irons certainly do heaps of damage. Any woman who has ever\r\nfound herself suddenly bereft of a nice fluffy bang, and in its place a\r\nstubby little burned-off fringe, will say that this is true, while\r\nthose numerous hair-crimping girls who have known the humiliating and\r\npainful experience of having a hot curling iron do frolics down their\r\nbacks can add startling testimony, and, what is more, show disfiguring\r\nscars as proof.\r\n\r\nIf the iron is used carefully and at proper heat, the hair is not\r\ninjured. But certain it is that when the iron is smoking-hot it kills\r\nthe life and lovely texture of the hair. Besides, how very ugly and\r\nunkempt those burned little ends look! It was surely not of such that\r\nPope wrote:\r\n\r\n    Fair tresses man's imperial race ensnare,\r\n    And beauty draws us with a single hair.\r\n\r\nSoft papers in which the short locks are wound is a good method for the\r\ngirl who singes her top-knot every time she tries to curl a few little\r\ntendrils. Kid curlers are all right, providing the hair does not become\r\nentangled in the small ends, and so have to be torn when the hair is\r\ntaken down. There is a certain secret in the hair-curling process which\r\nis too intangible for written description. The hair must not be wound\r\ntightly and the effect must be loose, fluffy and natural.\r\n\r\nThe great necessity for keeping the hair perfectly trimmed is to rid it\r\nof the split ends, for hair cannot be nice under such conditions. When\r\nthe nourishment within each hair shaft does not extend the full length,\r\nthen the hair cracks into several finer hairs, and one of these perhaps\r\nresumes the growth. That leaves a rough, bad shaft. The best way to\r\nkeep the hair clipped properly is to twist it in rolls and to singe off\r\nall the little ends that stick out.\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to state positively how often the hair should\r\nbe shampooed. Oily hair needs a thorough washing every two weeks, while\r\ndrier tresses should not be given a bath oftener than once a month.\r\nHalf the reason for falling hair, or hair that seems never to grow, is\r\ncaused by improper shampooing. The scalp must be kept scrupulously\r\nclean. And I doubt very much whether the soap and soiled water can be\r\nthoroughly rinsed out without the use of running water, the bath spray\r\nbeing the most convenient means of getting this. How often, after\r\nwashing one's hair, one finds a white, sticky substance clinging to the\r\nteeth of the comb! This should never be, and the hair must be\r\ncontinually washed until it is fluffy and soft and absolutely without\r\nany suggestion of the shampoo. When the hair is very oily a\r\ndessertspoonful of ammonia and a pinch of borax should be added to two\r\nquarts of warm water. This will soften the water and make the soap more\r\neasily rinsed out of the hair. The liquid verbena soap makes a\r\ndelightful shampoo. Recipe can be found at the end of this chapter.\r\n\r\nWhen shampooing, rub the lather through the strands gently, and with\r\nthe finger tips remove all the little particles of dust and dandruff\r\nwhich may be clinging to the scalp. And may I gently suggest that you\r\ndo not go at the task as if you were scrubbing a grease spot out of a\r\nrug? You must neither dig the scalp with your nails nor wring out your\r\nhair as you would a wash-rag. Try not to get your hair into a more\r\nmussed-up and tangled condition than is absolutely necessary. After\r\nusing the bath spray liberally dry with warm towels, then--if\r\npossible--get some one to vigorously massage the scalp. This will\r\nalmost invariably prevent one from taking cold. Never begin combing out\r\nyour locks until they are nearly dry. A sun bath of twenty minutes is a\r\ngood tonic.\r\n\r\nOccasionally an egg shampoo is more beneficial than the usual one of\r\nsoap. This is especially true when one has just recovered from a fever\r\nor when one's scalp is in an unhealthy condition or afflicted with\r\ndandruff. The rosemary formula is very effective.\r\n\r\nDandruff is nearly always the result of neglect. If the scalp is washed\r\nas frequently as it should be, dandruff is not so likely to accumulate,\r\nalthough it is a perfectly natural formation. When the hair is\r\nexcessively oily or the scalp unusually crowded with dandruff, the\r\nweekly shampoo should not be neglected.\r\n\r\nBlond hair should always be washed with the yolk of an egg, as that\r\nwill make it keep its golden tints. Mixing the egg with a pinch of\r\nborax and a pint of warm water is a good plan.\r\n\r\nHair dyeing is one of the mistakes of unwise femininity. All dyes\r\ncontaining either mercury or lead are very dangerous. But why should\r\nwomen dye their hair? Goodness only knows. One might as well ask why\r\nwomen fib about their age, or why women shop three hours just to buy a\r\npair of dress shields. There are some questions of life which we are\r\ndestined never to solve. There is nothing lovelier than white hair.\r\nCombine with it a fine complexion and a pair of animated brown eyes and\r\nyou have as picturesque a beauty as ever awakened emotions in the heart\r\nof man. But, nevertheless, women moan and wail over every stray gray\r\nhair. They go off downtown and proceed to lug home a cartload of\r\nmysterious bottles which they keep religiously away from hubby's\r\ninvestigating eye. I won't tell the result of the experience, for it is\r\ntoo well known. It is a certain episode through which half the women of\r\nforty years have passed--sooner or later. When comes the desire to\r\ntransform those little threads of silver into deeper shades remember\r\nthe charming lines of Bancroft:\r\n\r\n    \"By common consent gray hairs are a crown of glory, the only object\r\n    of respect that can never excite envy.\"\r\n\r\nUnknown washes, as well as dyes, do great mischief. Good health,\r\nwholesome food and proper care of the scalp are the three most\r\nimportant essentials toward beautiful and luxuriant hair. There are\r\nsome simple lotions, harmless and easily prepared, which will assist\r\nthe growth and nourish the roots.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESSING THE HAIR.\r\n\r\nIt has always been a double-turreted wonder to me why romancers are\r\nforever harping about heroines with \"tresses in artistic disarray.\" All\r\nthe tresses in such condition that I have ever gazed upon have looked\r\nmost slovenly and ofttimes positively waggish. How any one can think\r\nthat a girl with a tangled braid hanging down her back, a little wad\r\nover one ear, a ragged, jagged fringe edging its way into her eyes and\r\nhalf a dozen little wisps standing out here and there in haystack\r\nfashion--how one can even fancy that such a head as that is pretty is\r\nmore than I can explain. Clothes may make the man, but rational\r\nhairdressing goes a pretty long way toward making the woman. Observe my\r\nlady in curl-papers and my lady togged up for a dinner party. Comment\r\nis unnecessary, for you have all seen her--or yourselves, which is\r\nquite the same thing.\r\n\r\nThose fortunate women to whom straight hair is becoming should never\r\nindulge in curls. There is nothing prettier than hair drawn loosely\r\naway from the face. It leaves displayed those lovely lines on the\r\ntemples about which artists and poets go mad. As to the style of\r\ndressing one's hair, that must be left solely to one's taste. If the\r\nlines of the head, the shape of the face and the hair itself are\r\nstudied a bit the solution of the most becoming coiffure is very easily\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\nA head that looks like a wax image in a hairdresser's window is\r\ncertainly anything but pretty. Neither is it artistic, for the\r\ncorrectly crimped and waved side-locks are too mechanically planned to\r\nlook at all natural. To nearly all women the plainer the mode of\r\nhairdressing the more becoming it is. That does not mean that you\r\nshould comb your hair straight back and wad it into a funny little\r\nbump. Quite the contrary. Comb it back if you will, but have the coil\r\nloose and graceful. It is very bad for the hair either to be pulled\r\nback tightly or to be closely arranged. Ventilation is necessary, and,\r\nby the way, caressing and smoothing the hair with the fingers is a good\r\ntonic for its growth and beauty.\r\n\r\nA few loose short curls about the face seem necessary to the good looks\r\nof the majority of women, but the heavy bang was shelved years ago.\r\nWasn't it hideous? But perhaps you are too young to remember. Get out\r\nthe family album, then, and see for yourself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. JOHN JACOB ASTOR]\r\n\r\nThere are certain rules for hairdressing that were just as good in\r\nEve's hairpinless age as they will be a hundred years hence. By keeping\r\nthese rules in mind you can make a picture or a cartoon of yourself,\r\njust as you wish. The one thing to remember is that the lines and\r\nproportions of the face must be carefully considered and a mode of\r\nhairdressing adopted which will lessen and not exaggerate those lines\r\nand proportions. Be alert to your defects, and do not forget that what\r\nmay be essentially appropriate for one woman will be dismally\r\ninappropriate for another.\r\n\r\nSuppose a woman has a square, heavy jaw. She is just the one who flings\r\ndefiance at prevailing fashions and clings to the dear old straight\r\nbangs deep over her eyes. The heavy chin makes a straight line, the\r\nheavy fringe makes another, and the result is that her face is as\r\nperfectly square as rules and measurements could make it. Let this\r\ndeluded lady shake herself together and mend her ways. By making the\r\ntop of her head appear wider the broad jaws will--according to all laws\r\nof reasoning--seem to be narrower. A few dainty puffs towering up\r\nprettily and a soft, fluffy fringe left flying out over the ears will\r\nnot only add grace to the forehead but lighten the heaviness of the\r\nlower part of the face. A bow of ribbon or any other perky little\r\nheaddress will detract from the straight cross lines.\r\n\r\nThen there is the woman with the sharp chin, the woman of the\r\nwedge-shaped face. She invariably wears her hair over her ears and so\r\nelongates the V lines of her chin. By arranging the hair close to the\r\nsides of her head and putting it in a soft low coil on the top a much\r\nmore pleasing effect can be got.\r\n\r\nThe same rule for the heavy-chinned woman applies to the chubby,\r\nfat-faced feminine mortal. The \"roly-poly\" visage looks less\r\n\"roly-poly\" when the front hair is drawn back and up in pompadour style\r\nand the long tresses piled into a nice little tower. The pompadour mode\r\nof hairdressing also holds good with the girl whose eyes are set too\r\nhigh. This helps along the old-time idea that the eyes of a woman\r\nshould be in the middle of her head--that is, that they must be set\r\nmidway between the bottom of the chin and the top of the hair.\r\n\r\nFor the women with eyes set too low an exactly opposite arrangement\r\nshould be adopted. Instead of drawing the hair away from the face,\r\nbring it down to it. Part the hair and let it come low on the temples\r\nand brow.\r\n\r\nI have never seen anything or anybody look much funnier than does a\r\nwoman with a sharp-pointed nose and a pysche knot. The nose bumps out\r\nin the front and the wad of hair sticks out in the back with a\r\nsimilarity that is positively convulsing to any one with half an eye\r\nfor the humorous. It gives one an idiotic longing to take a measuring\r\nrule and find out the exact distance from \"tip to tip.\" Another waggish\r\npicture is made by the snub-nosed girl with her hair arranged a la\r\nMadonna. These long hirsute lamberquins on either side of her face make\r\nthe poor little nose appear even smaller, like unto a wee dab of putty\r\nor a diminutive biscuit.\r\n\r\nDon't caricature your facial defects. Don't get the lines of your head\r\nand face \"out of drawing.\" Don't twist your hair up after every new\r\nfashion that chances to come along. Study the contour of your head from\r\nevery side and then adopt that style of hairdressing which at once\r\nbrings out the good points and conceals the bad ones. The most becoming\r\ncoiffure is the one that gives the most artistic balance to the face.\r\nWhat will do for the fat, dumpy Miss Plump will make a human joke out\r\nof the lank, willowy Miss Slender.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERFLUOUS HAIR.\r\n\r\nIf there is one blemish more than another that gnaws out our very heart\r\nsupports and gives a good hard case of nervous chills, it is this. What\r\nwoman can look at another so afflicted without a feeling of deep pity?\r\nThere is something so masculine and altogether impossible in a bearded\r\nlady, even if she be merely a poor imitation of the real exhibited\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nUnless proper means are taken to abolish it, superfluous hair should be\r\nleft religiously alone. The more it is pulled out or irritated the\r\nlustier and heartier will be the growth that follows. As for cutting\r\nit--well! who does not know what the result is sure to be? A\r\nchallenging Kaiser William mustache, maybe, or perchance a Herr Most\r\nstyle of hirsute trimmings. In applying creams of any sort to the face,\r\nit is wisdom to leave the upper lip untouched with the cosmetic,\r\nalthough one may feel perfectly safe in using home-made emollients\r\nwhich do not contain animal fats. Heat, rubbing and friction are all\r\nconducive to the pests, and such oils and fats as vaseline, glycerin,\r\nolive oil and mutton tallow or suet should never be used. Depilatories\r\nlikewise should be shunned. The powdered preparations are usually\r\ncomposed either of sulphite of arsenic or caustic lime, and merely burn\r\nthe hair off to the surface of the skin. It seems quite impossible for\r\nany such powder to kill or dissolve the hair roots without injury. The\r\nsticky plasters, made of galbanum or pitch, and which are known as\r\n\"heroic\" measures, are equally undesirable, since they are not\r\npermanent cures any more than the depilatory powders. The worst feature\r\nof these cures is that for every hair pulled out or burnt off a coarser\r\none takes its place, and for every tiny, downy growth a fully developed\r\nhair appears. Of course, the plaster removes this soft lanuginous\r\ngrowth with the hardier one, and for that reason should be left\r\nseverely alone. The tweezers are therefore less objectionable than the\r\nplaster, but this is such a painful way of getting happiness that I\r\ncannot advise it.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt but that electrolysis is the best cure. The only\r\nobjection to this is that an incompetent operator will cause her patron\r\nconsiderable pain, and will also be likely to scar the skin. A dainty\r\nlittle woman who has been an expert in this work for years tells me\r\nthat it is not at all necessary for the beauty patient to hold the\r\nlittle handles--I know not the technical term--of the battery, although\r\nthis causes a little more careful work on the part of the operator. At\r\nthe same time, it makes the operation less painful, and really not at\r\nall hard to endure. The general desire to have the work done quickly\r\ncauses the scars. If the hairs are picked out here and there and not\r\nclose together the skin can heal and the rest of the horrors be\r\ndestroyed at the next sitting. To remove a very prolific growth several\r\n\"seances\" will be necessary. But the result will be clear, unscarred\r\nskin, and no future chance of the wee worries coming back to bring\r\nheart-hurts and mental agony.\r\n\r\nTo those who have any timidity at all about the electric needle, there\r\nis peroxide of hydrogen and diluted ammonia. Use one as a lotion one\r\nnight and the other the next. This will often prove a permanent cure,\r\nwhile a better, less noticeable state is certain. The remedy is one,\r\nhowever, that will take time and patience. The superfluous hair will\r\ngradually become light-colored and almost white, and the ammonia will,\r\nif used persistently, deaden the growth. Do not expect the bleach to\r\ntake effect right away, for it won't. If the skin is at all irritated\r\nrub on pure, thick cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR THE HAIR.\r\n\r\n    Liquid Verbena Soap: Cut in small pieces one-half pound of pure\r\n    imported castile soap. Put in porcelain kettle with two quarts of\r\n    warm water and dissolve by boiling. When cold it should be of the\r\n    consistency of rather thin cream; if thicker, add more water. Stir\r\n    in one-fourth pint of alcohol and let stand several days in a warm\r\n    room. All the alkali and impurities will settle to the bottom of\r\n    the bottle, leaving the liquid as clear as crystal. Pour off\r\n    carefully, leaving the residue for kitchen purposes. Perfume with a\r\n    few drops of oil of verbena, or any scent one may prefer. A small\r\n    quantity of this used in the shampoo is delightfully cleansing.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shampoo for Dandruff:\r\n\r\n    Yolk of one egg.\r\n    One pint of warm water.\r\n    One ounce spirits of rosemary.\r\n\r\n    Follow with thorough washing with liquid verbena soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Egg Shampoo: Shake the yolk of an egg in a pint of alcohol, strain\r\n    and bottle. To a bowl of warm water add two tablespoonfuls of the\r\n    liquid.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dandruff Cure and Hair Tonic:\r\n\r\n    Forty-eight grains resorcin.\r\n    One-fourth ounce glycerine.\r\n    Alcohol sufficient to fill a two-ounce bottle.\r\n\r\n    Apply every night to the scalp, rubbing it in well. This is good\r\n    for falling hair.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lemon Hair Wash (for blond tresses):\r\n\r\n    One ounce salts of tartar.\r\n    Juice of three lemons.\r\n    One quart of water.\r\n\r\n    Apply a cupful to the hair and scalp just before the shampoo.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Quinine Tonic for Oily Hair:\r\n\r\n    One-half pint alcohol.\r\n    One-half pint water.\r\n    Thirty grains of quinine.\r\n\r\n    Apply every other night, rubbing into the scalp.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hair-curling Fluid: Mix one and one-half drams of gum tragacanth\r\n    with three ounces of proof spirits and seven ounces of water.\r\n    Perfume with a drop or two of attar of rose. If too thick add a\r\n    little rose-water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE HANDS\r\n\r\n    \"I take thy hand, this hand,\r\n    As soft as dove's down, and as white as it;\r\n    Or Ethiopia's tooth, or the fann'd snow,\r\n    That's bolted by the northern blast twice o'er.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty hands--like sweet tempers and paragons of husbands--are largely\r\na matter of care and cultivation. Much more so, in fact, than most of\r\nus are aware. While tapering fingers and perfect palms count for\r\nconsiderable, the general beauty of the hand lies not in its correct\r\noutline so much as in the whiteness and velvety softness of the skin\r\nand the perfectly trimmed, well-kept nails. I have seen hands as plump\r\nas rotund little butter rolls, with fingers like wee sausages, and I\r\nhave also gazed upon long, slender hands as perfect of form and\r\nproportion as any hand ever put into a Gainsborough masterpiece. And\r\nboth have been called beautiful. Of course, we all know that the\r\nGainsborough model is perfection, but nevertheless we can content\r\nourselves with the knowledge that really ideal hands are as rare as a\r\nfew other nice things in this world, and that we can struggle along\r\nvery well with our good imitations providing we are able to keep them\r\nclean and well groomed.\r\n\r\nThe poets have raved their wildest over the beauty of women's hands\r\nfrom the time when Adam had his first desire to write jingles--if he\r\never was so silly--to the present day of Kipling's entrancing verse.\r\nShakespeare in his many tributes to the unfortunate young Juliet spoke\r\nof the \"white wonder\" of her hands, and there has probably never lived\r\na versifier who has not, at one time or another, gone into paroxysms of\r\npoetry over \"lovely fingers,\" and \"dainty palms,\" and all that. And I\r\ndon't wonder, do you? for a woman's hand--when it is beautiful--is\r\ncertainly a most adorable thing. It should be soft and yielding and\r\ncaressing--with small, dainty joints, a satiny surface and carefully\r\nmanicured nails of shell-pink tint.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, tight sleeves and very tight gloves must be condemned.\r\nNext, relaxation and repose are to be cultivated. A beautiful hand that\r\nfidgets continually is not to be admired for anything beyond its\r\nceaseless efforts to be doing. Ben Jonson once said: \"A busy woman is a\r\nfearful nuisance,\" and it's more than likely that he had in mind some\r\nfussy dame whose nervous fingers were everlastingly picking at things\r\nand continually on the wiggle.\r\n\r\nThe hand can easily be taught to move gracefully. The ordinary Delsarte\r\nmovements of swinging the wrist backward and forward, of raising the\r\nhands high above the head, and the general exercises for the\r\ncultivation of gesture and expression are all good and can bring about\r\nthe habit of spontaneous relaxation and activity. No gestures at all,\r\nthough, are better than awkward ones.\r\n\r\nLarge joints are very unsightly. It is said of the Countess of Soissons\r\nthat she never closed her hands for fear of hardening the joints.\r\nFunny, isn't it, to what extremes those old-time ladies went? And yet\r\nthe Nordauites say we are degenerates!\r\n\r\nOf Mme. Crequy it is recorded that \"she was a woman most resolute,\" and\r\nin proof of that assertion the chronicler says that if no lackey were\r\nwithin call she opened the doors herself--without fear of blistering\r\nher hands! It was the desire for dainty, delicate white hands that\r\nfirst gave nice little boys the task of trotting after stately dames\r\nand carrying my lady's prayerbook or fan. Fancy one of those\r\nporcelain-like creatures of helplessness hanging onto the strap in a\r\nState Street cable car! Perish the thought! And what a jolly time Mme.\r\nCrequy would have had could she have indulged in a Christmas shopping\r\nscrimmage. After a few tussels with the swing doors that bar our\r\nentrance to the big stores, Mme. Crequy would have blistered her hands\r\nto the queen's taste and the poultice stage. There's no chance of a\r\ndoubt about that.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATHING THE HANDS.\r\n\r\nWith the hands, as with almost everything else in the strife toward\r\nbeauty culture, cleanliness is the first great essential. You cannot\r\nkeep your hands smooth and pretty without an occasional hard scrubbing.\r\nUnless the hands are unusually moist naturally, hot water should not be\r\nused. Have the bath tepid--just warm enough to be cleansing. Say a fond\r\nfarewell to all highly-scented soaps and bring yourself down to a\r\nsteady and constant faith in the pure white imported castile. I doubt\r\nvery much if there is a soap manufactured which can equal this for its\r\nharmlessness and purity. The best way is to buy a large bar, letting it\r\ndry thoroughly, and cutting off small slices as they are needed.\r\n\r\nNever fail to let the soapy water out of the basin and fill again with\r\na clear rinsing bath. When drying be sure that the towel is not coarse\r\nor rough, and that it absorbs every particle of moisture. Very gently\r\npress back the cuticle around the nail. A little orange-wood stick or a\r\npiece of ivory will assist you when the skin is inclined to stick close\r\nto the nail. Let the hands have their most cleansing bath just before\r\nyou go to bed, and then is the time to apply your cold cream or\r\ncosmetic jelly, which--in nearly all cases--is all that is needed to\r\nkeep the hands soft and nice.\r\n\r\nWearing gloves at night is very uncomfortable and quite unnecessary.\r\nLotions can be put on an hour or so before one goes to bed, and by that\r\ntime they are usually pretty well absorbed into the cuticle.\r\n\r\nIf the hands are red use lemon juice, applying cold cream as soon as\r\nthe juice is dry. For callous spots rub with pumice stone.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE FINGER NAILS.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great change in manicuring methods of late. The old\r\nsteel implements of torture are banished, and the ivory instruments\r\nhave long since taken their place. Steel should never be put to the\r\nfingers, except to use the scissors when the nails are too long, or to\r\ntrim the skin in order to free it from hangnails. The best operators no\r\nlonger cut away the cuticle about the base of the nail, and the\r\nmanicure who does that nowadays is not a student of the French method\r\nof manicuring, which supplanted every other some time ago. The same\r\neffect--and better, in fact--is got by simply pressing back the flesh\r\nwith the end of an ivory or orange-wood instrument. The gouging and\r\nsnipping, so irritating to a person of nerves, is thus avoided.\r\nHowever, if you only know how, you can manicure your nails at home and\r\nthey will look every bit as well as if you trotted downtown and spent\r\nhalf a day and a nice big dollar.\r\n\r\nFill a china wash basin with a suds of warm water and castile soap.\r\nSoak the hands for five minutes. With an old soft linen towel push back\r\nthe skin around the nails. If there are hangnails snip them away\r\ncarefully. Cutting the cuticle at the base of the nail was a barbaric\r\nfeature of a new science which disappeared when it became more rational\r\nand refined. Never, under any circumstances, must the inside of the\r\nnail be scraped with a sharp instrument. Another thing to be avoided is\r\nthe vulgar application of pink nail cosmetics. Who has not seen a\r\npretty hand made hideous by nails all gummed up with red paste? Oh,\r\nyes, and claw-like nails! They, too, have been \"called in,\" now that\r\nprogress, good sense and civilization go marching on at a two-step\r\npace.\r\n\r\nThe nails should be trimmed the same shape as the finger tips, and left\r\nneither too long nor too short. There's a happy medium that is easily\r\ndiscovered, because of its usefulness, its convenience, and its\r\nartistic beauty. A too-highly polished surface is also a vulgarity\r\ninvented by the old-time manicure. A little powder rubbed briskly on\r\nthe nail with a heavily padded polisher is a great improvement, but\r\nwhen the nails shine with door-knob brilliancy it's high time to call a\r\nhalt. As for jagged, uneven nails--there's no excuse for them.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR THE HANDS.\r\n\r\nCosmetic Jelly: Take thirty grains of gum tragacanth, soak in seven\r\nounces of rose-water for two days, strain through muslin and add\r\none-half ounce each of glycerin and alcohol, previously mixed. This\r\ndries in a moment after application.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Glycerin Balsam:\r\n\r\n    White wax, one-half ounce.\r\n    Spermaceti, one ounce.\r\n    Oil of sweet almonds, four and one-half ounces.\r\n    Glycerin, one and one-half ounces.\r\n    Oil of rose geranium, eight drops.\r\n\r\n    Melt the oils. Remove from fire and beat in the glycerin and\r\n    perfume. Stir briskly until cold and white.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Creme Duchesse:\r\n\r\n    Benzoinated mutton tallow, three ounces.\r\n    Oil of sweet almonds, one ounce.\r\n    Glycerin, two drams.\r\n    Rose-water, two drams.\r\n    Oil rose geranium, twenty drops.\r\n\r\n    Heat the tallow and oil of almonds in one vessel and the other\r\n    three ingredients in another. Mix the two and stir until cold. On\r\n    account of the mutton tallow, which might possibly cause a growth\r\n    of superfluous hair, this cream is not desirable as a face\r\n    cosmetic. The benzoinated mutton tallow can be made by taking\r\n    one-half pound of the tallow and one-half ounce of the benzoin, and\r\n    keeping at a high temperature until the alcohol has completely\r\n    evaporated. Strain through muslin.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Almond Meal:\r\n\r\n    Orris root in fine powder, four ounces.\r\n    Wheat flour, four ounces.\r\n    White castile soap, powdered, one ounce.\r\n    Powdered borax, one ounce.\r\n    Oil of bitter almonds, ten drops.\r\n    Oil of bergamot, one fluid dram.\r\n    Tincture of musk, one-half fluid dram.\r\n    Mix well and pass through a sieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To make the hands soft: Take one quart of warm water, and in it\r\n    soak one-half pound of oatmeal over night, then strain and add one\r\n    tablespoonful of lemon juice and one teaspoonful each of olive oil,\r\n    rose-water, cologne, glycerin and diluted ammonia. Rub into the\r\n    skin three times a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To plumpen the hands: One-fourth ounce tincture of benzoin, eight\r\n    ounces of rose-water, and four ounces of refined linseed oil. Rub\r\n    in morning and night. This is equally nice for the neck and arms.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wash:\r\n\r\n    Rose-water, three ounces.\r\n    Bay rum, 2 ounces.\r\n    Glycerin, one-half ounce.\r\n    Borax, one-half ounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Amandine:\r\n\r\n    Blanched bitter almonds, three and one-half ounces.\r\n    Powdered orris root, three-fourths ounce.\r\n    Powdered white castile soap, three-fourths ounce.\r\n    Glycerite of starch, one and three-fourths ounces.\r\n    Clarified honey, one ounce.\r\n    Oil of lavender flowers, one-half dram.\r\n    Oil of bergamot, one-half dram.\r\n    Oil of bitter almonds, four drops.\r\n\r\n    Beat the blanched almonds with a small quantity of water to a\r\n    smooth paste, add the other ingredients, and mix intimately. A\r\n    solution of cochineal will color it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE EYES\r\n\r\n    \"Tell me, sweet eyes, from what divinest star did ye drink in your\r\n    liquid melancholy?\"--_Bulwer Lytton._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou would think, wouldn't you, that women would be good to themselves?\r\nBut they aren't. Not a bit of it! They abuse their complexions with\r\ncosmetics as deadly as Mrs. Youngwife's first plum pudding. They \"touch\r\nup\" their tresses with acids terrific enough to remove the spots of a\r\nleopard. They paddle around in the rain like ducks in petticoats and\r\novershoes, and then sit down and chat with the woman next door for a\r\nwhole hour, so that the damp skirts can more properly inaugurate a\r\nhorrible cold that will settle down and stay for six weeks or more. And\r\ntheir eyes--but that's a story in itself.\r\n\r\nAn oculist once said that every dot in a woman's veil was worth $5 to\r\nthe gentlemen of his profession. The eye is being constantly strained\r\nto avoid these obstacles in its way, and, of course, it is weakened and\r\ntortured. Think of a woman paying $1.50 for something that will, in\r\ntime, destroy her eyesight just as sure as fate! I leave it to you if\r\nshe's not a ninny? But women do these things in spite of\r\neverything--except when the overworked eyes begin to pain, and then\r\nthey're glad enough to do almost anything for quick relief.\r\n\r\nTo keep one's eyes in good, healthy condition, rigid laws must be laid\r\ndown and carried out, though the heavens fall and the floods descend\r\nand everything gets up and floats out into Lake Michigan. You must not\r\nread in bed, and you must kiss good-by to that becoming black veil of\r\nmany dots and spots.\r\n\r\nWhen you crawl out of bed in the morning do not dig your fists into\r\nyour eyes and rub and rub until, when at last you do open those sleepy\r\n\"windows of the soul,\" there is two of everything in the room, and big\r\nblack spots are whizzing through the air. Pressure on the eyeball\r\nflattens the lens of the eye, and is sure to produce myopia, or\r\nshortsightedness. If the eyes are not inflamed at all they should be\r\nwashed every morning in moderately cold water. In case of inflammation\r\nan application of hot water and milk in equal parts will be found most\r\nbeneficial. Dry with a piece of old, soft linen, being sure to wipe\r\ninward toward the nose so as not to issue invitations to those horrors\r\nof womankind--crow's feet! Great care should be taken to keep all\r\nforeign substances, especially soap and other irritants, from the\r\ndelicate skin of the lids, and particularly from the still more\r\nsensitive eyeballs.\r\n\r\nGaslight brings direful havoc to good eyes, especially when the flame\r\nis in a mood to flicker and splutter, as gas sometimes does. Take a\r\nfaint, wavering light and a piece of embroidery and you have as fine a\r\nrecipe for premature blindness as can be unearthed in a month of\r\nSundays. Sewing in the twilight is equally disastrous, as is the habit\r\nof facing the light when writing or reading.\r\n\r\nFew women realize the great need of resting the eyes occasionally, and\r\nthe unhappy result of trying them to the utmost limit. The very moment\r\nthat the eyeballs ache work should be suspended, no matter how\r\nnecessary or urgent. Rose-water and plantain in equal parts makes a\r\nrefreshing wash, and elderberry water is said to be good when there is\r\na disagreeable itching.\r\n\r\nIf the eyes are hot and watery use hot water which has been poured over\r\nrose leaves. Witch hazel, that good old stand-by, is always refreshing\r\nand is especially good when combined with camphor water. It is best\r\nwhen applied at night and allowed to dry on the lids. Weak tea, which\r\nis the eye tonic of our grandmothers, is also splendid.\r\n\r\nA lotion that has been tried over and over again and found excellent\r\nfor tired and inflamed eyes, is made by rubbing one teaspoonful of\r\npulverized boracic acid in fifteen drops of spirits of camphor and\r\npouring over this two-thirds of a cup of hot water. Stir and strain,\r\nand use as needed.\r\n\r\nTo brighten the eyes, steep good green tea in rose-water, soak bits of\r\nabsorbent cotton in the liquid, and bind on at night.\r\n\r\nFor granulated lids--and what is more maddening and painful?--make an\r\nalum paste. This is done by rubbing a small piece of alum into the\r\nwhite of an egg until a curd is formed. Apply to the lids upon retiring\r\nat night, tying a piece of soft linen over the eyes.\r\n\r\nSo many girls say that they look a fright in eyeglasses, and ask if\r\nthey should wear them. Most certainly if the eyes are worn out and\r\nfailing. An oculist of the very best reputation should be consulted.\r\nThe fee does not exceed that of the quack, and the eyes are tested with\r\ngreater thoroughness. Glasses must be chosen with the utmost care, as\r\nill-fitting lenses can make a great deal of trouble. They are worse\r\nthan no glasses at all. Then, after eyeglasses are put on, they must be\r\nchanged now and then to suit the changing conditions of the sight. If\r\nthe eyes are not in a bad state, wearing spectacles for a few months\r\nmay strengthen them so that the glasses can be discarded. Also, if the\r\noculist knows his business as he should, he can give you much valuable\r\ninformation concerning the care of your eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL WHO CRIES.\r\n\r\nNow, about the girl who weeps. You don't see many of her these days.\r\nWomen used to think that big, sad eyes, just ready to send forth a\r\nNovember gale of tears, was quite the proper thing, especially if there\r\nchanced to be a man about. Women of experience--and who should really\r\nknow--say that tears are worn-out weapons for bringing masculinity to\r\ntime. We later-day mortals go in for everything that bespeaks strength\r\nand backbone and a certain amount of strong-mindedness. When little\r\nwifey wife begins to snivel nowadays, Mr. Husband doesn't upset the\r\nfurniture in his efforts to kiss away the tears. He is quite likely to\r\nstraighten up and say: \"Oh, brace up, Pauline!\" or else, \"Go look in\r\nthe glass, my love, and see what a beautifully tinted nose you have!\"\r\n\r\nYes, these are unromantic days, and there's no mistaking that fact!\r\nThere's little room for the weepy, wailing woman whose big, inflated\r\nambition is to dampen stunning neckties and deluge nicely laundered\r\nshirt-fronts. Of course, women must have their good, comfortable cries\r\nonce in a while, but if they're wise they will retire to their own\r\nrooms and have it out by themselves. This is not quite so satisfactory\r\nas the old-time methods, for the reason that loneliness does not\r\ninspire an exhibition of woe, and if one doesn't look out one is apt to\r\nforget what one is boo-hooing about. But, take it all in all, it's\r\nsafer and more in keeping with fin de siecle rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nIt used to be that a man would say: \"Well, it breaks me all up to see a\r\nwoman cry. I just can't stand it!\" But now it's different. Instead, he\r\nremarks wearily: \"Anything but a yowling woman!\"\r\n\r\nThe poets have written lots of lovely things about tears.\r\nNotwithstanding that fact, there is an old German proverb: \"Nothing\r\ndries sooner than a tear,\" which isn't so bad. And Byron, you know,\r\nsaid that the busy have no time for tears. Which, one must acknowledge,\r\nis quite true when one thinks how everybody is up and hustling these\r\ndays. They're either wearing themselves down to skin and bone trying to\r\nearn a living and to reside in a $60 flat with electric lights and a\r\nreal back yard, or else they're gradually killing themselves in an\r\neffort to enjoy life and to have a good, jolly time all around.\r\nHowever, that's neither here nor there. So let's jog along to more\r\ntimely topics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYELASHES.\r\n\r\nWho hasn't bumped into the woman who is woefully wandering around minus\r\nher eyelashes? My dear girls, you make the mistake of your life when\r\nyou begin to snip and clip and tinker with those pretty little curtains\r\nthat fall over your eyes. If eyelashes are cut in infancy they will\r\ngrow longer, but when one gets big enough to wear long skirts and to do\r\none's hair up high and wear a little bonnet with jet dofunnies on it,\r\nthere's not much of a show for eyelashes being made longer by trimming.\r\nTouching the lashes with castor oil will increase the growth, and\r\nmoistened salt is also good.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EYEBROWS.\r\n\r\nThe eyebrows must be kept well brushed, and by persistent care can be\r\npinched into graceful lines. A heavy eyebrow can be trained with really\r\nlittle effort. The brush should be small and rather stiff and firm. It\r\nwill at once cleanse and invigorate.\r\n\r\nI cannot approve of penciled eyebrows. A professional in the \"make-up\"\r\nart can touch the eyebrows here and there and bring a marvelous change.\r\nBut for the ordinary amateur it is better left undone. Besides, if\r\ncoloring is applied, it is only a short time before the hair will fall\r\nout. And then won't you look pretty?\r\n\r\nEyebrows that meet over the nose are really very disfiguring, and the\r\ncure is so simple that there is no need of this blemish, providing, of\r\ncourse, that one can afford to take the necessary treatment. The\r\nelectric needle is the only sure and certain cure, and two sittings\r\nwill be sufficient to remove them for good and always. Be sure that you\r\npatronize only the best operator, as you will surely regret it if you\r\ndon't.\r\n\r\nSage tea, with a few drops of alcohol added, will darken the eyebrows\r\nwithout injury. Cocoanut oil makes an excellent tonic to increase the\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE TEETH\r\n\r\n    \"Some ask'd how pearls did grow, and where?\r\n      Then spoke I to my girl,\r\n    To part her lips, and shew me there\r\n      The quarrelets of pearl.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Herrick._\r\n\r\n\r\nFemininity may be heir to many beauty woes, but ugly teeth is one\r\ntrouble which is often caused by sheer neglect. How many of us can\r\nrecall the days of childhood and girlhood without remembering the fibs\r\nwe told to escape cleaning our teeth? The blessed mothers implored and\r\nbegged and threatened and fussed, but we went our way joyful and\r\nserene, making all due preparations for future unhappiness. But when\r\nthe girl began to think more about her personal appearance, and less of\r\nthe frivolities of advanced babyhood--oh, that we were all back at that\r\njolly time of life!--things were very different. The neglected teeth\r\ngot good attention then, but often the mischief had already been done.\r\nI trust that the younger readers of this volume on beauty will remember\r\nthat this is hopelessly true, and something not to be forgotten--like\r\nyesterday's toasted marshmallows or to-day's lesson in political\r\neconomy.\r\n\r\nI have heard it said that too much brushing will injure the teeth, but\r\ndon't you believe it! The sooner you become accustomed to a moderately\r\nstiff brush, that will do its work well and thoroughly, the better. All\r\nforeign matter must be constantly removed, else decay will come as sure\r\nas fate. A perfect state of cleanliness cannot be unless the teeth have\r\nproper and constant attention. By this I do not mean that you must\r\ncease all other occupations and take up that of eternal scrubbing.\r\nSimply keep your teeth clean. Toothpicks must not be used excessively,\r\ncold water should not be applied--or very hot, either, for that\r\nmatter--and all powders containing gritty substances must be tabooed.\r\nIt is quite unnecessary for me to add that you must not bite thread or\r\nbreak nuts with your teeth, for all of us have had this bit of\r\ninformation dinned into our ears since the time when \"little children\r\nshould be seen and not heard\" made life a worry and a care. I must\r\nconfess, however, that I have seen women untie knots and do various\r\nbits of very remarkable mechanical work in this unique manner. My\r\nexperience has been so broad in this particular line of observation\r\nthat the expression \"biting ten-penny nails\" has never appeared to me\r\nto be much overdrawn.\r\n\r\nIf one seriously desires fine, beautiful, white teeth--and who\r\ndoesn't?--one must treat them well. Just before going to bed, give them\r\na thorough cleaning, using waxed dental floss to remove any large\r\nparticles which may be between them. Use only a pure powder, the\r\ningredients of which you know. Be sure that all powder is well rinsed\r\naway. See that your brush is kept scrupulously clean. Upon arising in\r\nthe morning rinse the mouth with diluted listerine. This makes an\r\nexcellent wash, especially when the gums are tender and liable to\r\nbleed. Brush the teeth with tepid water. After breakfast, luncheon and\r\ndinner, wash them again, letting the last cleansing be the most\r\nsearching and thorough. Once in a while it is wisdom to squeeze a\r\nlittle lemon juice onto the brush. This will remove the yellow\r\nappearance that often comes, and will also keep your teeth free from\r\ntartar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRINCESS HENRY OF PLESS]\r\n\r\nEvery six months visit your dentist and have your teeth thoroughly\r\nexamined. The smallest cavities should be filled at once, and the pain\r\nwill be less than when these agonizing crevices get so large that you\r\nfeel that it's a flip-up between going to a dentist or jumping into the\r\nlake. I know that most of us women are cowards when it comes to seances\r\nin dentist chairs, but all such things--like house-cleaning and writing\r\nletters to folks you don't like, and entertaining your husband's maiden\r\naunt--all these things are heaps nicer when they're well over with.\r\nThey are the events which we prefer should ornament the past instead of\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\n\r\n    To Sweeten the Breath:\r\n\r\n    Alcohol, twelve ounces.\r\n    Cinnamon, two and one-half drams.\r\n    Ginger, one-half dram.\r\n    Essence of peppermint, one dram.\r\n    Cloves, one-eighth dram.\r\n\r\n    Mix and leave in infusion for two weeks in a tightly covered\r\n    vessel; filter and bottle. Put one teaspoonful in a glass of water,\r\n    and rinse the mouth with this every morning.\r\n\r\nRecipe for violet tooth powder appears in the chapter on perfumes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             BATHING\r\n\r\n    \"Even from the body's purity, the mind\r\n    Receives a secret sympathetic aid.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Thomson._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe road to beauty has never been better known than it was to the Greek\r\nand Roman women of centuries ago, yet they did not begin to have the\r\nresources in cosmetic arts that we have now. But they bathed\r\nincessantly, believing that cleanliness and health were the vital\r\npoints in their endeavors to be lovely. They went in for athletic games\r\nto a large degree, and thereby hangs the secret of well-developed\r\nfigures and fine, stately carriage. Creamy lotions for the face, made\r\nmostly of almond oil and the oil of cocoanut, were their complexion\r\nsolaces.\r\n\r\nNo doubt these beauties of the past centuries had more time than we for\r\ntheir baths and games, but nevertheless let us make a strong, stern\r\neffort to follow in the wake of their excellent teachings. Surely they\r\nproved the wisdom of them in their own incomparable beauty.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of baths reminds me of Mme. Tallien, the beautiful French\r\nwoman, who lived in the time of the first Napoleon. She went in for\r\nbaths galore. Let me tell you what she did.\r\n\r\nShe gathered together all the strawberries or raspberries that the\r\ncorner grocery could supply. These were mashed to a pulp and the\r\nbathtub filled. In this Mme. Tallien bathed until the idea of milk and\r\nperfumed baths appeared to her fancy. There were many absurd and\r\nuseless fads those days as well as wise beautifying practices--just the\r\nsame state of affairs as now confronts us.\r\n\r\nHow much more rational than Mme. Tallien's notions were the methods of\r\nDiana of Poitiers, who, history tells us, was fresh and lovely at\r\nsixty-five! She left the berries and things to their rightful place,\r\nthe breakfast table, and each morning took a refreshing bath in a big\r\ntub of clear rain-water. There has nothing yet been found, even in this\r\nprogressive age of electric elixirs and beautifying compounds, that can\r\nequal this old-time aid to loveliness.\r\n\r\nWith the delightfully convenient bath-rooms, that even the most\r\nordinary apartment or flat has now, bathing is not a matter of trouble\r\nand bother, but is, instead, an invigorating pleasure. I believe firmly\r\nin the need of the daily bath. Not the thorough scrubbing, mind you,\r\nbut the quick sponging and the plunge. Let the thorough scrubbing be at\r\nleast twice during the week, and the five-minute plunges on other days.\r\nCertain it is that one is much refreshed by the dipping luxury, and\r\nstill more certain is the fact that in no other way can the flesh be\r\nkept healthy and firm. To those who are robust enough to stand it, the\r\ncold bath is very good, but I would not advise it as a general thing\r\nfor women. For actual cleansing warm water and pure soap are necessary.\r\nThe shock of cold water immediately closes the pores, and they then\r\nretain all the impurities that they should cast out. The temperature of\r\nthe water for the daily tepid bath should be about seventy-five or\r\neighty degrees, never more than that.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the bath should be taken at night or in the morning is a\r\nquestion which each must decide for herself. While it has often been\r\nclaimed that a bath at night will quiet the nerves and make one sleep\r\nsweetly, I have known many persons who found it an utter impossibility,\r\nas it caused them to be restless and wide-awake. One reason why the\r\nbath before going to bed is desirable is that a soothing emollient can\r\nbe applied to the face, neck and hands, and thus will the skin be\r\nwhitened and beautified. After a warm plunge the pores of the skin are\r\nopened and in excellent condition to absorb a good skin food or a\r\npleasant cream.\r\n\r\nBath bags are simply luxuries. They are pleasant ones, to be sure, but\r\nthey should never take the place of the flesh brush. It is best to\r\nfollow the scrubbing with a gentle washing with a bath bag, for the\r\nalmond meal and the orris root will give a charming, velvety appearance\r\nto the skin. They should never be used a second time, as the bran\r\nfrequently becomes sour after a drying. So, if you are of an economical\r\nturn of mind, you will make your bath bags very small, just large\r\nenough to serve for one beauty bath.\r\n\r\nA little starch thrown into the bath will sometimes whiten the skin.\r\nSalt is not cleansing at all, but is very invigorating and a pleasant\r\ntonic if one is worn out and languid. Turkish baths are splendid\r\ncomplexion-makers, but must not be indulged in too frequently. If the\r\nskin is dry and feverish, a dry bath--or massage--with oil of sweet\r\nalmonds will promote a healthy skin and bring about good circulation.\r\n\r\nConstant bathing is the best remedy for excessive perspiration. But\r\nthis is not really effective unless a little benzoin is added to the\r\nwater, and the armpits well dried, and dusted with powder afterward. A\r\ngood bathing powder for this purpose is made of two and one-half drams\r\nof camphor, four ounces of orris root and sixteen ounces of starch.\r\nReduce to a fine powder and tie in coarse muslin bags.\r\n\r\nRemember that a coarse complexion, with black, disfiguring, open pores,\r\ncan be almost entirely cured by keeping the pores of the body free from\r\nsebaceous matter. Have the bathtub carefully scoured each day, as the\r\noils and dust washed from the body invariably collect on the sides just\r\nwhere the water reached. For the thorough cleansing have the tub half\r\nfilled with warm water. Use a coarse rag, a bath brush and large,\r\ncoarse towels. Before stepping into the water wash the face and neck\r\nwell with castile soap and a camel's-hair brush, this being\r\nparticularly necessary when the pores are clogged and acne has formed.\r\nRinse thoroughly and dry with gentle pats. When using the brush, do not\r\nforget to let the scrubbing go well down onto the chest, lest your neck\r\nwill be bleached white and nice only part of the way.\r\n\r\nOnce in the tub, go over the body briskly with the flesh brush, using\r\nplenty of good soap and not being at all sparing of elbow grease. This\r\nscrubbing is very invigorating, for it exercises the muscles and stirs\r\nup one's blood as well. After the scrubbing use the bath spray, letting\r\nthe water get gradually chilled. The drying should be brisk and quick,\r\nand a warm robe of some sort must be donned while the hair is being\r\ncombed for the night, the teeth brushed and the face anointed with a\r\npure home-made cosmetic. Then go to bed. If you don't find a prettier,\r\nfresher complexion with you next morning, then I'll miss my guess, and\r\nwill take up another occupation than that of doling out beauty advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Quireda Bath Bags:\r\n\r\n    One pound of fine oatmeal.\r\n    One-half quart of new clean bran.\r\n    Two-fifths pound powdered orris root.\r\n    Two-fifths pound almond meal.\r\n    One-fourth pound white castile soap, dried and powdered.\r\n    One ounce primrose sachet powder.\r\n\r\n    Dipped in tepid water and used as a sponge these bath bags make a\r\n    velvety lather that softens and whitens the skin in a way that\r\n    warms the cockles of one's heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DIET\r\n_\r\n    \"Good food is the basis of good conduct, and consequently of\r\n    happiness; more divorces are caused by hash than by\r\n    infidelity.\"--_Hetty Green._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of eating is nourishment to build up the nerves, the\r\nmuscles, the blood, the tissues, and, in fact, the whole body. Judging\r\nby woman's mad devotion to things she should not eat, this is a piece\r\nof information which has never before been confided to her.\r\n\r\nLet the food be well cooked, daintily served and delicately\r\nflavored--for all that aids digestion with persons of sensibility and\r\nrefinement--but see to it that the ingredients are wholesome and of the\r\nbest and freshest qualities. A fifteen-cent lunch at one of the\r\ntearooms, where dishes are prepared with some idea of the rules of\r\nhygiene, is much better than a twenty-five-cent course dinner at a\r\ncheap restaurant. This is a hint for the business girl who lunches\r\ndowntown.\r\n\r\nRipe fruits, served upon green leaves, are always appetizing, even if\r\nthere is nothing more than toast or rolls to go with them. Cereals,\r\nsuch as rice, barley or hominy (they must be steamed for hours), served\r\nwith rich cream, make ideal luncheons. A baked apple, a bit of rice\r\npudding, or a custard--they, too, are worth the while and the price.\r\nEggs, either boiled or carefully scrambled, or made into an omelet,\r\nflavored with a dash of parsley, and chops or fish delicately broiled,\r\nare substantial viands. Soups or broths, breads, fruits and an\r\noccasional salad make desirable luncheons. A noonday meal of creamed\r\npotatoes and green peas is not to be despised, and it's a godsend to\r\nthe poor stomach that has been heroically tussling with cocoanut\r\npudding, fruit cake and chocolate rich enough to own a castle in\r\nEurope. Such dishes as Italian spaghetti, with tomato sauce and\r\nParmesan cheese, or celery or cress salad, with no other dressing than\r\nthe best olive oil and a teaspoonful of vinegar, will do very well.\r\n\r\nThere is no economy in buying badly cooked luncheons. Seek quality, not\r\nquantity, and, so far as health and good looks go, you'll find yourself\r\ngetting along famously.\r\n\r\nRich foods, especially pastries, can bring forth an array of facial\r\neruptions that is positively maddening to the poor victim. Ice cream\r\nsoda, too, deranges the stomach and creates all sorts of disagreeable\r\ndisturbances. Hot bread and rolls, indulged in to an appalling extent\r\nin southern households, can do more real damage to a good, fair skin\r\nthan all the winds and wintry blasts that ever shook chimneys or swept\r\nfriskily around corners and alleyways.\r\n\r\nOvereating not only brings indigestion and creepy dreams, but\r\ninvariably makes the complexion coarse, high-colored and overruddy.\r\nThat does not mean that one should nibble at things and not demolish a\r\n\"good square meal.\" Eating should be understood--rules laid down and\r\nreligiously carried out.\r\n\r\nUsually hygienic dishes and health foods comprise a complete list of\r\none's special horrors. Most girls who have tried them say so. But just\r\nthe same, there are dozens--yes, hundreds--of nutritious viands that\r\nare decidedly more palatable and appetizing than the sweets and\r\nindigestible doughy nothings that not only make of you a physical wreck\r\nbut set you to wishing most heartily that the man who invented mirrors\r\nhad died of the measles in his early infancy.\r\n\r\nRice is a good old stand-by as a builder-up of a run-down constitution.\r\nBut you don't like it? Well, then, stew it with chicken sometime and\r\nyou will soon discover what great possibilities are in this despised\r\ngrain. Oatmeal, as it is usually cooked, is a thing of horror, to be\r\nshunned and avoided and run away from. But oatmeal left to slowly\r\nsimmer for a full hour, and served half liquid, fluffed over with a bit\r\nof powdered sugar and covered with rich cream, is fit for a queen--most\r\nespecially if the royal lady is ambitious for a fair visage with sweet,\r\nsoft skin and cheeks just touched with the crimson of health.\r\n\r\nA thick porterhouse steak, broiled quickly and well seasoned with salt,\r\npepper and butter, or rare little chops of lamb, are always excellent\r\ntonics, as well as complexion tinters.\r\n\r\nVery often a lack of beauty is nothing more than a lack of proper\r\nnourishment. The best cure in the world for a haggard, wan, white face\r\nis a proper understanding of good foods. Sometimes a tonic of iron is\r\nneeded to brace the wearied physical state. Cod liver oil, which is so\r\nvery disagreeable to most people, is the sure cure for the girl whose\r\nextreme slenderness causes her to lie awake nights to fret and worry.\r\nBut when the oil is prepared with malt it is even better, and also less\r\ntrying to swallow. A combination of malt and hypo-phosphates is\r\nexcellent too, and will bring back the fire of energy to the eye, and\r\nthe roses to the cheeks. A dessertspoonful taken before meals will\r\nstimulate and strengthen, and get the tired body into a better state to\r\nresist the wear and tear of ill health or overwork.\r\n\r\nOne beautiful woman of my acquaintance declares that the secret of her\r\nradiant looks is simply lettuce and olive oil. She eats lettuce summer\r\nand winter, and this queer complexion cure has certainly worked like a\r\ncharm in her case. She buys the crisp young head lettuce, being careful\r\nto use only the inner leaves. Over this she pours two tablespoonfuls of\r\nthe best olive oil and the very slightest dash of vinegar. Salt and the\r\nleast wee bit of sugar finish the salad. The good qualities of lettuce\r\nare usually destroyed by rich, mustardy dressings, that breed acute\r\ndyspepsia and desperate despair over good looks. But olive oil and\r\nlettuce is as good a combination for rugged health and a fair face as\r\none can find in a year's search from Cape Horn to the Yukon. Others\r\nbesides the lovely lady of whom I speak have found it so. The secret,\r\nthough, is, I fancy, in the olive oil, which is an excellent aperient.\r\n\r\nA complexion-destroying habit is that of eating late lunches just\r\nbefore going to bed. An apple or an orange is a benefit--as is also\r\nplenty of cold, distilled water--but when it comes to gnawing chicken\r\nbones, devouring big slabs of rich cake or finishing up a dish of\r\nleftover salad, then is the time that kind relatives or guardians\r\nshould step in, say a word and take a hand. The girl should be saved\r\nfrom herself at almost any expense.\r\n\r\nFruit is a panacea for many complexion ills. What a pity, then, that\r\nblind womankind persists in dabbing things on her nose instead of\r\nputting healthful, purifying beauty food into her stomach.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason in the world why fruit should be considered a\r\nluxury. It should be used as a staple article of diet. Surely that must\r\nhave been the original intention. But alas, how many housewives will\r\npay forty cents for a can of lobster that will upset stomachs, frazzle\r\npleasant tempers, cause all sorts of complexion horrors and bring a\r\nperfect comet trail of nightmares and dyspepsia! And these same women\r\nwill wrap themselves in a sanctimonious mantle of economy when the\r\nwoman next door pays the same sum for a dozen great juicy oranges.\r\n\r\nGrapes and apples are among the most nutritious fruits, and there is\r\nnothing in the world so good for a skin of oily surface or yellow hue\r\nas a grape diet. Besides, grapes are extremely appetizing, are very\r\neasily digested and are sure to agree with even the most delicate\r\nstomach. Ripe peaches have nearly all the merits of the grape, and, if\r\nin proper condition, are also quite unlikely to bring about indigestion\r\nor stomach disorders.\r\n\r\nThere has never yet been concocted a better spring tonic than\r\nstrawberries. The reason why they are particularly excellent to enrich\r\nand purify the blood is because they contain a larger percentage of\r\niron than any other fruit. It is a shame ever to embarrass and\r\nhumiliate the luscious things by imprisoning them in the indigestible\r\nlayers of a shortcake. A fluff of pure powdered sugar and a dash of\r\nwhipped cream and you have a toothsome dish fit for the most finicky\r\ngod that ever graced Olympia's pleasant realms.\r\n\r\nThe woman who has a dingy, muddy skin must pin her faith to oranges,\r\nlemons and limes. These are simply unrivaled as complexion clearers.\r\nThe juice of the grape fruit is fine, too. Fruits of this class\r\nstimulate and make active the digestive organs, which, as you probably\r\nknow, are the main seat of nearly all complexion ills. A breakfast of\r\noranges and strawberries will do more toward making you a pretty,\r\nwholesome, healthy woman than almost anything else.\r\n\r\nTo be perfectly wholesome, fruit with firm flesh, like plums or apples\r\nor cherries, must be thoroughly masticated. The skin of raw fruit\r\nshould under no circumstances be eaten. It is covered invariably with\r\nmultitudes of minute germs which always swarm upon the surface of the\r\nfruit and multiply rapidly under favorable conditions of warmth. Before\r\neating grapes or cherries all dust and impurities must be removed by\r\ncareful washing in several waters.\r\n\r\nBut to sum up the entire question of diet, eat what you know will agree\r\nwith you, and choose the blood-making, nourishing foods. Let fruit and\r\nvegetables predominate in your meals, but do not avoid meats entirely.\r\nCake is not harmful unless very rich, but greasy pastries--like pies\r\nand tarts and things of that sort--are simply utterly, hopelessly\r\nimpossible! Fats make the skin oily and coarse, pastries produce\r\npimples and blackheads faster than you can doctor them away, and too\r\nmuch sweets will have about the same effect. Instead of buying candies,\r\nsave your money and acquire a fine complexion along with a bank\r\naccount. It will pay in the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SLEEP.\r\n\r\n    \"What a delightful thing rest is! The bed has become a place of\r\n    luxury to me. I would not exchange it for all the thrones in the\r\n    world.\"--_Napoleon I._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf womankind half realized the beauty benefits of plenty of restful,\r\nrefreshing sleep, all femininity would be crawling into bed at sunset.\r\nI've often wondered why the great sisterhood that is praying and\r\nworking and fretting for physical loveliness does not understand that\r\nmore real help comes from rational, hygienic living than can be\r\nsqueezed out of all the cosmetic jars that ever enticed weak feminine\r\nhearts.\r\n\r\nBeauty sleep! Why, we've heard of it since the long-ago days when our\r\nblessed mothers sung it, lullaby-fashion, into our ears! As little\r\ngirls it brightened the \"sand-man\" hour and made us go contentedly to\r\nbed. As women it should rightly continue its good work, and the dear\r\nLord knows we need it more now than we did then, for--perhaps--the\r\ncrow's feet have begun to show their ugly little tracks and the fine\r\ncomplexion of early girlhood is losing its luster and brightness, and\r\nis growing a bit dull and yellowed--like a leaf first touched with the\r\nautumn chill.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you won't believe it, but there are right ways of sleeping and\r\nwrong ways as well. The girl who curls up like a shrimp is the one who\r\nwill be writing to me in a great flurry and worry, telling me that her\r\nshoulders are round, and that she simply can't make them nice and\r\nsquare as they should be for the new tailor-made that is to transform\r\nher into a happy little Easter girl! The woman who is horrified to find\r\nwrinkles appearing like wee birds of omen does not have to tell me that\r\nshe is a pillow fiend and sleeps with her head half a foot higher than\r\nher heels. It stands to reason that a pillow will push the flesh of the\r\nface up into little lines. There is no necessity for pillows at all,\r\nand girls don't need them for comfort any more than a little puppy dog\r\nneeds patent leathers or overshoes. The bed should be hard and\r\nperfectly flat, with springs that do not sag or give and let the poor\r\nsleeper roll down in the middle in a jumbled-up heap. A hair mattress\r\nis the best for health and comfort, but others will do nicely if they\r\nare only perfectly flat and not too soft.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do, then, is to dispense with the pillow. If this\r\nchange cannot be accomplished all at once, then let your pillow be\r\ngradually made smaller and smaller until none at all is desired. Your\r\nsleep will be much better, and after the habit is once formed a pillow\r\nis looked upon with derision. I know foolish mothers who put their\r\nchildren to sleep on pillows as big as a school-girl's love for\r\ncaramels, and the poor babies tumble and toss, and the next morning\r\nthose mothers dose them for a pain in the \"tum-tum.\" Alack-a-day!\r\nBabies don't need pillows--unless it be those little soft cushions of\r\ndown that are as flat as pancakes.\r\n\r\nBut to return from babies to beauty. If your sleep is restless and you\r\nawaken with a dull headache and the feeling of weariness that makes you\r\nwant to begin the night over again so as to get refreshed, you may be\r\nsure that something is wrong--either you are worried or troubled or are\r\nworking too hard for your own good. Perhaps your digestion is out of\r\norder, or the room is not properly ventilated. It may be any of these\r\nthings that keep you from getting the rest that is really so very\r\nnecessary for health and comfort and good looks.\r\n\r\nHeavy bedding is also distressing, and as good a maker of nightmares as\r\ndeviled crabs or plum pudding. Light blankets make the best covering.\r\nLet the window be open at top and bottom, so as to have perfect\r\nventilation. Don't eat an indigestible lunch before retiring; this is\r\nthe greatest of all beauty follies. Lie on the abdomen, with your hands\r\nat your sides. This position will keep your shoulders back, will give\r\nyou a good figure and a better carriage. When you have followed these\r\ndirections and still find that you spend most of the night crawling\r\naround over your bed vainly seeking a comfortable and restful spot,\r\nthen you can make up your mind that you need a good tonic and a\r\ndoctor's counsel, for your nerves or your digestive organs are not as\r\nthey should be.\r\n\r\nTo sum it all up in a nutshell: You must sleep well, and you must sleep\r\na great deal if you wish to be the \"woman beautiful.\" Sitting up late\r\nat night will cause grey hair as will nothing else. It makes those dark\r\ncircles about the eyes, and causes the \"windows of the soul,\" to lose\r\nhalf their luster and softness and beauty. Who ever saw a pretty woman\r\nwith dull, lifeless eyes? She wouldn't be pretty were she so afflicted.\r\nBy sleeping properly, the body is kept stronger and fresher, and thus\r\nthe complexion is benefited greatly. Wrinkles do not come so soon, the\r\nskin does not take on that muddy, yellow hue as it would otherwise, and\r\ncheeks are pink and rosy with that greatest of all rouges--Health.\r\n\r\nThere's a heap of truth in all this. If you do not believe it, then\r\ngive up late hours--be they for study or pleasure--and see if the\r\nproblem won't work itself out nicely with you. I think it will. In\r\nfact, I am really quite sure of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              EXERCISE\r\n\r\n    \"Better to hunt in fields for health unbought\r\n    Then fee the doctor for a nauseous draught\r\n    The wise for cure on exercise depend;\r\n    God never made His work for man to mend.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Dryden._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would have done your heart good to see her.\r\n\r\nShe came into the room with the briskness of a March flurry of snow.\r\nHer cheeks were poppy-red, her eyes sparkled with the mere joy of\r\nliving. And she chuckled happily as she tucked back the curly scolding\r\nlocks that were flying about, all helter-skelter, like feathers\r\nunloosed or fluffy chicks blowing away from the mother wing.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it jolly?\" she chirped, as she threw her muff on the floor and\r\nmade a dive for Peter Jackson. Peter Jackson is a cat, as black as the\r\nace of spades and as pugilistic a feline as ever walked a fence.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't what jolly?\" I queried. \"The weather or your sprightly self? Do\r\nyou know, you'd make a splendid poster now for some new-fangled\r\ncork-soled walking shoe? Or perhaps a bearskin ulster for Klondike\r\nwear. I'm sure a feather boa concern would pay a fortune for your\r\npicture. I would I were an artist man, with a little brush and a little\r\npencil and a little palette with nice little paint puddles on it----\"\r\n\r\n\"What-in-the-world? Here I start in to dilate upon the joys of exercise\r\nand off you go, just like a musical top with your buzz-buzz-buzz, and\r\nyour incomprehensible talk about little painters and little palettes\r\nand little paint puddles. I'm sure it's not a bit nice of you.\"\r\n\r\nPeter Jackson was shoved to the floor.\r\n\r\n\"But walking is jolly!\" she piped, \"and I've just had the very\r\ngloriousest tramp and I feel as fine as a--what is it they say? Oh, as\r\nfine as a violin--I--I mean fiddle. I walked miles and miles--perhaps\r\nnot quite so far--and the wind was blowing a blue streak right in my\r\nface. Ugh! first it made me shiver and creep up into my collar. But\r\nbimeby I got nice and warmy, and my cheeks tingled. I felt as if I\r\ncould walk from here to the place where the sun goes down. Do you know,\r\nI never before realized how much fun it was to take a good tramp. I've\r\nhalf a mind to reform from my role of lazy-bones and walk every day,\r\nwhether it snows, blows, cyclones, or turns warm, and fells us all with\r\nsunstrokes and heat prostrations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Health is the vital principle of bliss, and exercise of health,\" said\r\nI, quoting Thomson.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well,\" and my pretty, rosy-cheeked guest arose. \"I must be going.\r\nYou know how it is when one gets to preaching physical culture and\r\nspouting poetry. Ta-ta!\" and away she went, like the fleeting memory of\r\nlast night's dream.\r\n\r\n                    *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nIf women paid as much attention to exercise as do men there would not\r\nbe so many wrinkles and stooped shoulders among the feminine sex, and\r\nold age wouldn't rap on the door ahead of time. The girl who goes in\r\nfor outdoor sport, who isn't afraid of walking a block or two, who\r\nloves the cold air and who revels in wheeling and swimming and skating,\r\nis the one who won't be an old woman in appearance while she is still\r\nyoung in years. Keep the muscles firm and healthy by exercise. This\r\nwill not only improve your carriage and add to your general\r\ndevelopment, but will aid the digestive organs in their work and keep\r\nyou animated and cheery. Who of us does not know the inspiration of a\r\nwalk in the open air after a few days spent in the close atmosphere of\r\nthe house? Fresh air is the elixir of life. We can't have too much of\r\nit, and--oh, my girls--think of the exceeding cheapness of it! It can\r\nbe got for the asking, which is more than one can say for the various\r\nbeauty pomades and lotions that beckon us toward poverty.\r\n\r\nWalking and skating are the best exercises during the winter, but all\r\nkinds of exercises are acceptable, providing they are gone about in the\r\nproper manner. It is easy enough to see why thorough and regular\r\nexercise is absolutely necessary to health.\r\n\r\nWe all know--at least, we all should know--that the general size of the\r\nhuman body depends on muscular development. The same bony frame which\r\nmakes a slim-jim girl that tips the scales at seventy-five pounds can\r\nbe padded with good solid flesh until it boasts of a triple chin,\r\nfingers like wee roly-poly puddings, and a full 200 pounds in weight.\r\nThe framework of the body counts little toward size.\r\n\r\nThe muscles are like the various bits of machinery which go to make up\r\na steam engine. In performing their work they produce heat and motion.\r\nThe fuel which supplies this force is taken into the body as food,\r\nprepared for use in the intestinal tract, and from there carried by the\r\nblood to be stored up in the muscles and various tissues as latent\r\nforce. Through the circulation of the blood the whole body is heated by\r\nmuscular exercise. It stands to reason that continual exercise of a\r\ncertain kind will develop certain muscles. For instance, there's the\r\narm of the blacksmith or the firmly developed legs of the danseuse. The\r\nsame muscle that grows when used within certain limits will waste away\r\nwhen deprived of proper exercise.\r\n\r\nIn physical culture the object is the symmetrical development of all\r\nthe muscles, not one at the expense of the other. So, for that reason,\r\ndon't pin your faith to dumb-bells and Indian clubs and neglect more\r\nnecessary exercise. If you do you will in time find yourself possessed\r\nof big Sandow arms that will make the rest of you look as spindle-like\r\nas a last year's golden-rod stalk.\r\n\r\nWalking is as good a form of exercise as anything yet discovered. But\r\nwalking as most girls and women walk won't do you one bit of good. You\r\nmight just as well spend your time trying to count 700 backward or\r\nwhile away the hours talking 1880 fashions with the woman next door,\r\nfor all the health or happiness or physical development that you will\r\nget out of it.\r\n\r\nCorsets and bands and belts must be done away with. You must have full,\r\nfree use of your lungs. Then, don't wear heavy petti-coats that will\r\nretard the free movements of your legs and make your hips ache with\r\ntheir tiresome weight. Dress warmly but as lightly as possible.\r\n\r\nAbove everything else don't stick your fingertips into a muff and\r\nwaddle along like a little duck in sealskin and purple velvet\r\ntrimmings. Your arms must swing easily at your sides. Thus equipped\r\nwalking should not be a task, but a great, big, lovely joy, no matter\r\nif the frost does nip your nice little nose and make your cheeks feel\r\nas if they had been starched, dried, ironed and hung on the line to\r\nair.\r\n\r\nEnglish women who come to America can tell us a thing or two about long\r\nwalks. Only the other day a pretty Englishwoman with a complexion like\r\napple blossoms casually divulged the information that a walk of ten or\r\nfifteen miles was an old, old story to her. So, when I say that three\r\nmiles a day--the three miles ought really to be covered inside an\r\nhour--is not a bit too much to give one's muscles the necessary\r\nexercise, I hope you won't lean back in your chair and gracefully\r\nexpire. Some of you will gasp, no doubt, for a walk of five blocks to a\r\nsuburban station is usually looked upon as a heroic martyrdom to\r\ncircumstances and environments.\r\n\r\nAlas, for woman's fickleness! And alas, for her playful habit of going\r\nto extremes! Suppose, for instance, that Polly Jones says she is going\r\nto take a nice long walk every day of her life; that she knows the\r\nbountiful blessings and benefits of a brisk tramp, and that she will\r\ntake that tramp in spite of obstacles as big as the Auditorium or as\r\nimmense as her longing for a cherry-colored silk petticoat.\r\n\r\nThe first day--and, mind you, she has not walked a mile for weeks, the\r\nlazy girl--she covers five miles in an hour and ten minutes.\r\n\r\nAnd when she comes home she's such a wreck that the whole family is up\r\nin arms in a jiffy, and whisk out the tomahawks ready for war. That's\r\nthe end of Polly Jones' pedestrian exercises.\r\n\r\nAnd Daisy Brown. She does quite the same thing, only not so violently.\r\nThe first day she walks four miles, the next two, and then comes a trip\r\naround the corner to get arnica and liniments for her poor, aching\r\nbones. Thus also terminates Daisy's stern resolution to take daily\r\nconstitutionals.\r\n\r\nBut the wise woman. Daisy's and Polly's methods are not hers. Far from\r\nit! When she begins to walk for health and beauty she dons loose,\r\ncomfortable clothes, and with swinging arms and head well back, strides\r\nalong briskly and easily. Her first day's walk is scarcely a mile. The\r\nsecond tramp is longer; and gradually the distance is increased until\r\nthe three miles are covered in about fifty minutes.\r\n\r\nThe wise woman does not take her exercise in the afternoon, but in the\r\nmorning, an hour or so after breakfast, when the day is young and\r\neverything seems bright and hopeful and cheery. Then it is that the\r\nbabies are out in their go-carts and carriages, and the \"chillens\" are\r\ntrooping to school. It's heaps pleasanter than an afternoon walk when\r\none has more of the worries and events of the day on one's mind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN HELENA OF ITALY]\r\n\r\nIt is the regularity of exercise--and living, in fact--that brings the\r\nbest results. A stated time for baths, meals, rests and walks is the\r\nproper plan for those fortunate ones who are not rushed into a\r\ncondition of decrepit antiquity trying to do fourteen different tasks\r\nin thirteen small, limited minutes. Some of us, the very busy ones,\r\ncannot have the necessary rests during the day, but baths and exercise\r\ncan usually be arranged and carried out. They should be, for they are\r\nof more vital import than most of us realize.\r\n\r\nRunning is splendid exercise, but we city folk have few opportunities\r\nfor exhilarating fun of that sort. A woman sprinting for a cable car\r\nmight quite as well be a trained bear in a pink mosquito netting\r\npetticoat for the sensation and giggles she creates. With a bonnet\r\nperched over one ear or dangling dizzily from an escaping empire knot\r\nshe is neither a dignified nor an inspiring picture.\r\n\r\nSo it's quite as well all around to run in one's own room. In fact, the\r\nbest way to run is to run in one small spot and not go ahead. That\r\nsounds befuddled, but it is easily explained. Get into loose clothes,\r\nthrow open the window, place your hands on your hips and go through the\r\nmovements of running. It is best to be in stocking feet or light\r\nslippers, else that odious woman in the flat below may knock on the\r\nsteam pipe as a signal for peace and quiet.\r\n\r\nAfter fifteen minutes of mock running take an invigorating, tepid\r\nsponge bath with just a dash of benzoin in the water. After that comes\r\nvigorous friction with a rough towel. Then take a nap if you can spare\r\nthe time. Of course one must guard against exposure to cold after one\r\nis heated by the exertion of exercise.\r\n\r\nDancing would be one of the best of exercises were it not for the\r\nclose, ill-ventilated rooms, the tight clothes, the exposed shoulders\r\nand the nervous strain which is always on hand at large social affairs.\r\n\r\nAs for skating, there is nothing better. It makes a woman feel like a\r\nnew man. I say that quite consciously, as, in my opinion, to feel like\r\na new woman--that poor, long-ridiculed creature--would be more\r\nhumiliating than joyful. Don't you think so?\r\n\r\nHorseback riding is questionable exercise. The side saddle is apt to\r\nincrease the tendency to curvature of the spine, while tight corsets\r\nprevent the good that would come to the heart and lungs and digestive\r\norgans. Swimming is good, particularly for nervous, high-strung\r\npersons. And the wheel? Well, that best of all exercises--for it is the\r\nbest when indulged in by the wise woman, not the crooked-back,\r\nscorching, silly--is a story in itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          STOOPED SHOULDERS\r\n\r\n    \"Her grace of motion and of look, the smooth\r\n    And swimming majesty of step and tread,\r\n    The symmetry of form and feature, set\r\n    The soul afloat, even like delicious airs\r\n    Of flute or harp.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Milman._\r\n\r\n\r\nStooped shoulders is one beauty ill that is wholly unnecessary. Any\r\ngirl with real brains and a little energy and will power can make\r\nherself straight and bestow upon herself a good carriage. It is\r\nentirely a matter of doing and persevering. Most of us know remedies\r\nfor our small failings, but how many of us apply them persistently\r\nuntil a cure is brought about? Few indeed, and more's the pity.\r\n\r\nWhen starting the reform always bear in mind that the chest must be\r\nheld upward and outward. When this is done it is not necessary to keep\r\nthe shoulders back in a forced, strained position, and so make little\r\ncrowfeet in the back of your gown. The benefits of holding the chest\r\nthus are more than one--or two, either, for that matter. If practiced\r\ncontinually it will strengthen the lungs. It will also develop the\r\nchest and neck as no masseure of miracle-working fingers can ever hope\r\nto. Breathing exercises are also excellent.\r\n\r\nIncorrect positions during sleep cause many stooped shoulders. The big\r\nfat pillow of our grandmother's day is the worst kind of a horror. No\r\npillow at all is best, and after one becomes accustomed to sleeping\r\nthat way it will be found much more restful and altogether comfortable.\r\nThe best position for sleep is to lie face downward, with the arms\r\nstraight at the sides. Of course, I am fully aware that most women\r\nsleep curled up like kittens, but they can change their ways if they\r\nwill but try.\r\n\r\nThe woman with straight, good shoulders never carries her arms heaped\r\nfull of bundles, for that draws them forward and makes them droop as\r\ndismally as an ostrich plume in a blizzard. Instead, the \"budgets\" are\r\ncarried with the arms down at the sides. Neither does she clutch the\r\nback of her skirt in that bantamlike fashion practiced by the woman of\r\nless judgment. The back breadths of her new tailor-made are grasped\r\nabout six inches from the belt, and held up just so that they clear the\r\nground. Hats worn deep over the eyes are not desirable, this wise woman\r\nalso knows, for however tightly they are pinned to one's back hair,\r\nthey are mighty likely to keep one's body at an uncomfortable slant.\r\n\r\nThe plump woman who wears her hose supporters pinned to the front of\r\nher corsets seldom knows that the constant pulling of the elastics has\r\na tendency to make her shoulders droop. Shoes of high heels and narrow\r\ntoes are equally bad, for the wearer is plunged forward in an\r\nungraceful and line-destroying attitude. The low-heeled, square-toed\r\nshoe--that is now in vogue--is the thing to wear, and blessed be the\r\nLord for at last bringing womankind to a rational understanding of what\r\nshe should wear on her much-abused little feet!\r\n\r\nThe tailor-made gown is serviceable as a promoter of good figures, for\r\nusually, unless one keeps one's shoulders back, the front of the bodice\r\nproceeds to lay wrinkles in itself and so spoil the good effect that\r\nwomen love as they do their pet jelly dishes and their Dresden teacups.\r\n\r\nOther things to be remembered are: Always stand on the front or ball of\r\nthe foot and keep the knees straight. Carry yourself so that a string\r\nextended downward from your chest would reach the floor without\r\ntouching another part of the body. Do not push your head forward and do\r\nnot be in a hurry so that you will waddle along like a little duckling\r\nwith absolutely no grace or carriage. Dress comfortably, have your\r\nclothing well fastened, and your gown loose enough to give your lungs\r\nopportunity for the full expansion that, for the sake of your health,\r\nthey should have. Make sofa cushions of your pillows and sleep always\r\nface downward, flat on the mattress. Last, but not least, don't be a\r\nwoeful lady and amble along in a disconsolate, sloppy-weather fashion\r\nthat is so utterly hopeless that I could never set before me the awful\r\ntask of suggesting a remedy. One of the secrets of happiness and\r\nsuccess is cheerfulness. Men and women and even babies like cheerful\r\nfolk, while they will race their overshoes off trying to get away from\r\nthe unhappy ones of dismal tales and many worries. Be cheerful, even\r\nthough the laundress has washed your best handkerchief into a real-lace\r\nsieve, or the rains and snows of December have descended upon your best\r\nSunday bonnet and made a pocket edition of a rag-bag thereof, or even\r\nif the gas range has blown itself and all the kitchen windows into the\r\nnext block. Be cheerful at all hazards! It pays! Really it does!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              BREATHING\r\n\r\n    \"The common ingredients of health and long life are,\r\n              Great temp'rance, open air,\r\n              Easy labor, little care.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Sir Philip Sidney._\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first lessons that the beauty student must learn is how to\r\nbreathe properly. I know, my girls, that that sounds awfully stupid,\r\nbut there are yards and acres of truth in it nevertheless, and the\r\nsubject is well worth your while--you can depend upon that. Haven't you\r\never noticed that most of the women who have gone in for vocal culture\r\nhave round, pretty waists? Almost invariably the singer is a woman of\r\nfine figure, well-poised head, firmly-set shoulders and easy carriage.\r\nAnd the reason is simple. She has learned from the beginning that she\r\nmust breathe properly, that every breath must come from the abdomen and\r\nnot from the chest, and that to breathe in that way she must hold up\r\nher chin and expand her lungs.\r\n\r\nWe often mistake carriage for fine figure. It is the woman who poises\r\nher head well and who keeps her shoulders back that attracts the eye of\r\nother women. There is something brisk and energetic and active about\r\nher that makes of her a sight good to look upon; while another woman\r\nwith perhaps a much better figure will trail about with a\r\ndown-in-the-mouth air and a slow, doleful gait that will give one the\r\nblues and an absence of appetite for weeks to come.\r\n\r\nYou cannot possibly breathe properly and have your shoulders\r\nstooped--at least you cannot make such a combination without a mighty\r\nbig lot of discomfort. If you breathe as you should you will develop\r\nthe chest and bust, give better lines to the shoulders and--unless you\r\nare naturally inclined to be plump and rotund--will make your waist\r\nbecome round and slender and pretty. If you doubt this, try for\r\nyourself and see.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could impress my readers with the fact that improper\r\nbreathing brings many ills. Breathing is a highly important function,\r\nand bad breathing not only produces symptoms of consumption, but makes\r\nthe waist unduly large. The reason for this is that holding the chest\r\nup will keep all the internal organs in their proper places, and so not\r\nallow them to spread the waist in the unsightly way that usually\r\ndenotes deficient vitality instead of the \"Greek health\" upon which\r\nphysicians are wont to dilate. Good breathing strengthens muscles and\r\nmakes the flesh firm. The reward is a perfect, round, slender figure\r\nand a trim waist.\r\n\r\nBegin your breathing lessons in the morning just after getting out of\r\nbed, when you will have no tight skirts or bands to hinder the full\r\nexpansion of the lungs. Raise every window and get all of God's blessed\r\nair that you can, and, above all things, let not this practice cease\r\nwhen the winds of winter blow as if from Greenland's icy mountains. The\r\nbreathing exercise is all the better then. Place your hands on your\r\nhips and walk slowly across the room, your chest held upward and\r\noutward, and every breath coming deeply from the abdomen. After three\r\ntrips you will find yourself pretty well tired out. Rest for a few\r\nmoments and try again. The next morning make the exercises longer, and\r\nas soon as the muscles that hold your chest up become firm and strong\r\nthere will be little exhaustion. Vary the exercise by standing still,\r\ntaking as long a breath as possible and holding it for several seconds.\r\nThis practice, indulged in for five or ten minutes every day, is most\r\nbeneficial. But the main motive in all breathing exercises is to get\r\ninto the habit of standing straight with the shoulders held back and\r\nthe chest up. \"Play\" that you are trying to make your chest creep up\r\nand touch your chin.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest injuries that come from wearing tightly laced\r\ncorsets is the compression of the ribs. The unyielding steel and\r\nbuckram will not permit a variation in the waist measure as a deep\r\nbreath is inhaled or expelled. The proper and healthful corset is the\r\none that expands or contracts with each respiration of its wearer, and\r\nthat is why I am such an enthusiastic devotee of the corset waist with\r\nthe elastic bands on either side. It matters not one bit how tight the\r\nclothing may be, so long as it is given elasticity and is yielding.\r\nThis is absolutely necessary to perfect health and the proper\r\ndevelopment of a woman's figure.\r\n\r\nWith the breathing capacity increased, enlargement of the lungs and\r\ndevelopment of the chest are sure to be the results. But, be it\r\nunderstood, please, that this growth is not the work of a day or a\r\nweek, or a month even. However, if it is continued religiously there\r\nwill be a difference of five or six, or even seven, inches in your\r\nchest measure in the course of a year, to say nothing of the\r\nimprovement in carriage and figure, and the health and strength that\r\ncorrect breathing will give.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of things to remember. The first is that one must\r\nsecure breath control, the next that the best authorities condemn\r\nthoracic or upper chest breathing. Keep the chest up and out, and let\r\nthe expansion be at the waist line. Inhale slowly and smoothly as much\r\nair as you can, swelling out the lower chest at the sides just below\r\nthe arm pits as the air is drawn in. Hold this air five seconds. Then\r\nexhale it slowly and gradually, crushing in the ribs gently with the\r\nhands as the air goes out. During the exhalation be sure to keep the\r\nupper chest still. Do not let it sink, as it will be apt to if not\r\nrestrained by an effort of the will. Exhale again and hold the breath\r\nfor ten seconds, then for fifteen seconds, and finally for twenty\r\nseconds. This exercise will do for the first day. Increase the power of\r\nholding the breath by practicing regularly each day.\r\n\r\nBe careful not to make any motion suddenly. In calisthenics of any kind\r\nthe more slowly and carefully the exercise is performed the greater\r\nwill be the benefit. But best of all, keep in mind that these breathing\r\nexercises are not only making you a pretty woman of pretty figure, but\r\ngiving you that greatest of all beauty elixirs--health.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               MASSAGE\r\n\r\n    \"The love of beauty is one of the most firmly implanted qualities\r\n    of the human mind, and only those who are mentally deficient fail\r\n    to appreciate it. From the human standpoint there is no edifice so\r\n    beautiful as that earthly temple which enshrines the soul.\"--_Dr.\r\n    Cyrus Edson._\r\n\r\n\r\nMassage is as old as the hills. Most really good things are, I've\r\nfound. The Grecian and Roman women preserved their wondrous, wholesome\r\nbeauty by reveling in luxuriant baths and then undergoing vigorous\r\nmassage by their stout-armed slaves. Massage is a natural alleviator\r\nand comfort-giver. The first thing a baby does when he bumps his\r\nprecious head is to rub the injured spot with his little fist. Relief\r\nseems to come with friction. If one's temples hurt, the hands seem to\r\nitch and tingle to get to rubbing and smoothing out the aches there.\r\nAnd the reason for it is that friction makes active the nerves and\r\nblood vessels and exercises the tired or fretting muscles. Massage is\r\nexercise. If we were to cease using our arms the muscles would shrink\r\nand soon become incapable of movement. The skin outside would, of\r\ncourse, be affected by the general warpings of the tissues, and the\r\nresult would be everything that is dreadful to the mind\r\nfeminine--crow's feet, wrinkles, sallowness and lack of the tints and\r\ncolors of health. You who have enjoyed the pleasures of a Turkish bath\r\nmust know how new and robust and fresh you feel after the invigorating\r\ncleansing and pummeling by a strong and experienced masseuse.\r\n\r\nWe all know about the system of decay and renewing which the skin\r\nconstantly undergoes. It is much the same way with the muscles. The\r\nvery tiny cells of which the muscles are composed are continually being\r\nrepaired. As the wornout particles are rejected the new fiber is\r\ncreated. Does it not stand to reason that massage will facilitate this\r\nprocess, make the flesh firmer, restore vigor to the muscles and give\r\nnew life to the entire system?\r\n\r\nThe muscles of the face, more than those of any other part of the body,\r\nare lazy and torpid. As the troubles of life descend, the wear and tear\r\nof bothersome existence begins to show. The circulation becomes\r\ndefective, and this brings flabby tissues and a wrinkled, sallow skin.\r\nThen, oh, woe! woe! One feels as if one might just as well be dead and\r\ngone as to be trailing through life so afflicted.\r\n\r\nMassage means \"I knead.\" While the professional masseuse should be well\r\ninformed concerning the muscles of the face and neck, the location of\r\nthe veins and arteries, and the general formation of the skin, the\r\nlittle home body who wishes to rub away a few wrinkles or turkey tracks\r\ncan easily dispense with the acquiring of so much knowledge. With\r\nknowing what \"not to do,\" she will get along very well, although it has\r\nalways been my opinion that the simplest and most satisfactory way to\r\nlearn to massage one's own cheeks and brow is to go to a first-class\r\nprofessional for one or two treatments. If you keep your eyes open you\r\nwill easily learn the simplest and most effective movements.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to remember is that massage will both create and reduce\r\nflesh, according to the treatment given and the time devoted to it.\r\nSevere rubbing and rolling of the flesh between the fingers will\r\ngradually dissolve the fatty tissues. The flesh will then become soft\r\nand flabby, and the skin will be likely to fall into tiny lines unless\r\nan astringent wash, like weak alum water (used hot), is applied to\r\ntighten and harden it slightly, and so make the flesh firm. If the\r\nmassage is continued, the flabby flesh will also be reduced, especially\r\nwhen the astringent wash is applied to help the hardening process. When\r\nthe face is to be plumpened or wrinkles removed, then rub the skin very\r\ngently with a rotary motion, which is not a mere rubbing but a kneading\r\nas well, and follow with light tapping movements. Never roll the flesh\r\nbetween the fingers unless reduction is the object. Also, never massage\r\noftener than once every twenty-four hours, and then only for fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\nSo much for the don'ts. Before beginning the massage have the face\r\nperfectly clean. Wash with tepid water and pure castile soap. Otherwise\r\nthe dust and powder are kneaded into the pores and the result is\r\nfrequently extremely irritating.\r\n\r\nThe reasons for massage are many. It facilitates and stimulates the\r\nskin in its continual effort to throw off the tiny flakes of dried,\r\ndead cuticle. It is exercise for the muscles, and at the same time it\r\ninspires a livelier circulation of the blood. It is easy to understand\r\nthen why massage is so beneficial for the face, and why it makes a\r\nrosy, healthy complexion. Massage alone will remedy many a complexion\r\nill, for when the muscles are sluggish and torpid, the tissues weak and\r\nflabby, the circulation as slow as the messenger boys in the funny\r\npapers, and the skin sallow and wrinkled, all in the world that is\r\nneeded is a little gentle patting and coddling and rubbing into a less\r\nlifeless state.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken lest the skin become bruised and irritated.\r\nFor this reason a cream or skin food is used. Let me suggest that this\r\nemollient be of the good, pure, home-made kind, not the cheap cosmetic\r\nwhich has mutton tallow or lard as a principal foundation. The orange\r\nflower skin food (formula appears in the chapter on the complexion) is\r\nthe best formula for this purpose, as it will, by absorption, fatten\r\nand build up the impoverished tissues, and at the same time strengthen,\r\nwhiten and soften the skin. Mineral oils must never be used. Glycerin\r\nnot only makes the complexion darker and rather yellow, but it dries\r\nthe secretions of the skin very rapidly, and a dry, harsh surface is\r\nthe sure result. Vaseline--as we should know from its reputation as a\r\nhair tonic--will not prove a happiness to one.\r\n\r\nThe skin food should be rubbed in all over the face and far down upon\r\nthe neck with a firm, circular movement. When the cream is partially\r\nabsorbed begin the manipulations, starting at the forehead. Place the\r\nthumbs on the temples and in that way hold the skin firm and taut. With\r\nthe tips of the first and second fingers of both hands rub the lines\r\ntransversely. If there be wrinkles across the forehead, rub up and\r\ndown, holding the skin tight at the top of the forehead with the first\r\nfingers and manipulating with the second and third.\r\n\r\nAnother movement which is excellent for wrinkles is to place the first\r\nfinger of each hand crosswise of the wrinkles about half an inch apart.\r\nThen push up a little fold. As the left hand finger pushes its way\r\nalong the wrinkle, let the right hand one rub up and down, always\r\nkeeping the line up into a little hill.\r\n\r\nIn massaging the lines about the eyes the movement should begin by\r\nrubbing the eyelid from the nose outward half an inch beyond the end of\r\nthe eye, then returning below the eye toward the nose. This will make\r\nthe massage sweep back crosswise of the crow's feet. Another movement\r\nis to hold the skin taut and then knead the lines firmly with the first\r\nand second fingers of the right hand.\r\n\r\nIf the chin is fleshy and you wish to massage it down to smaller\r\nproportions, you must dissolve the fatty tissues by picking up the\r\nflesh between the thumb and forefinger and rolling and rubbing as much\r\nas you possibly can without injuring or breaking the skin. Then, in\r\norder to keep the flesh from getting flabby the rotund little chin must\r\nbe bathed in cold water, in which is a small pinch of alum, a piece the\r\nsize of a bean being plenty for a pint of water. This alum bath,\r\nremember, is only to be applied when you are reducing the carbon or\r\nfat.\r\n\r\nThe \"kneading\" movement is very beneficial. This is done very gently\r\nwith the thumb and forefinger only--precisely the motion used in\r\nkneading bread. The smoothing manipulation for the wrinkles is probably\r\nbetter explained as an \"ironing out\" motion. All lines can stand these\r\ntwo movements. Whenever the skin seems particularly dull of color and\r\ngenerally lifeless, then the patting comes in excellent play. This is\r\nmerely a gentle tattoo over the entire face. Electricity is an\r\nexcellent accessory to massage--but that is another story.\r\n\r\nAfter the massage, wet a wash cloth in water slightly chilled, and lay\r\nover the face. This will close the pores nicely. Dry and apply powder.\r\n\r\nI trust that my beauty students will easily understand the\r\nforegoing--it is certainly a difficult topic to explain lucidly. As I\r\nsaid before, it is a wise plan to go to some one who thoroughly\r\nunderstands the art and let her teach you. While massage can be given\r\nat home, it is more satisfactory if done by a professional whose\r\nknowledge of anatomy will assist her toward the best results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                DRESS\r\n\r\n    \"Be plain in dress, and sober in your diet;\r\n    In short, my deary, kiss me! and be quiet.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Lady W. Montague._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world has its full share of silly women--more's the pity--but there\r\nis not one who can hold a candle to the girl who trots about in the\r\ncold, bleak days of winter clad in summery undergarments fit only for\r\nthe warm atmosphere of a baker's oven in August. So long as these\r\nexhibitions of utter absurdity continue we cannot consistently harp\r\nupon woman's recently acquired good sense in dress. It seems more and\r\nmore the fad for girls to boast that they have never worn a vulgar\r\noutfit of flannel undergarments, but it is quite observable that these\r\nsame girls are the very ones who are eternally grunting and groaning\r\nand coughing and fussing. And how can they help it? You can't have good\r\nhealth if you keep yourself in a semi-refrigerated state. A sleeveless\r\nvest of silk is not sufficient to keep one's body warm, even though the\r\nprettiest bodice in Christendom and the swellest of \"coaties\" cover it.\r\nSkirts of white muslin, with pretty frills and lacey trimmings that\r\nfall in soft folds and ruffles around one's feet, are mighty dainty\r\nthings for the summer girl--but is there a colder sound than that of a\r\nstarched white petticoat in the dead of winter? Bur-r-rr! it gives one\r\nthe cold chills to even think of it!\r\n\r\nWho has not beheld the stunningly gowned girl stalking majestically\r\naround the shopping district in a little tailor-made jacket topped off\r\nwith a fur collarette? She tells herself that she is perfectly warm and\r\ncomfortable, but you and I know better, my dear, for we have seen her\r\nunhappy efforts to crawl up into this same collarette, and we have\r\nbeheld her shivering misery as a good stiff gust of January wind sends\r\nher flying around a corner.\r\n\r\nI am a firm believer in the tailor-made gown, and I am of the opinion\r\nthat style often counts more than real beauty with women of stately\r\ncarriage and pretty figure. But nevertheless, I believe first in\r\nkeeping warm and in protecting one's health. The girl in the smart\r\nlittle jacket could well afford to wear a winter coat over it on the\r\ncoldest days, and even then she would not swelter from the heat.\r\nReally, it is torture for a woman of common sense to go along the\r\nshopping district and see her poor, miserable sisters who let comfort\r\nfly to the four winds of heaven while they revel madly in appearances.\r\nIt's all very well, my girls, to look your best. But don't make\r\nsacrifices that will injure your health. I'd rather see a woman in a\r\nlast winter's coat with the seams shiny than look upon a foolish but\r\nradiant creature in a bit of a cape that would keep her about as warm\r\nas would two good-sized cobwebs stitched together. The first woman\r\nwould have the advantage of displaying evidence of real brains on the\r\ninside of her head. And beauty without brains isn't real beauty at all,\r\nbut a sad, shop-worn, tear-wringing imitation.\r\n\r\nIt is my opinion that in choosing underclothing for cold weather\r\nfinely-woven cotton is the best of all. Silk is not durable, and wool,\r\neven of the finest quality, will often prove irritating. Besides, so\r\nmany of us spend most of our time in steam-heated homes or offices that\r\nwoolen garments keep one too warm. The cotton union suit makes a very\r\ndesirable undergarment. This should be high-necked, long-sleeved, and\r\nmade to come well down over the ankles. For the girl whose particular\r\nworry is a nose of flaming red, let me say that in fleece-lined\r\nstockings, calfskin boots and warm overshoes lies her only hope of a\r\nless flamboyant nasal appendage.\r\n\r\nThere is no need of fourteen petticoats, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nreally nice old ladies insist upon wearing that number. One skirt of\r\nsilk or moreen, together with a tiny short one of white muslin and a\r\npair of sensible, warm, woolen equestrian tights will make one more\r\ncomfortable and will allay that immense swelling about the hips which\r\nmuch be-petticoated old ladies have. The tights, however, should be\r\nworn only when one is out of doors. During really cold weather no woman\r\nwith sense enough to fill a one-grain quinine capsule will venture out\r\nof the house without thus properly clothing her lower limbs. Let\r\nfemininity come to the understanding that in proper dressing and\r\nrational eating she will find the first and best materials for building\r\nher house of beauty. It's all very well to wear pretty, fluffy,\r\nlace-trimmed undergarments, but if you think that a wan, white, pinched\r\nlittle face pays you for such extravagances in silliness, then you are\r\na ninny. Wear the fluffy things if you will, but put on the warm ones,\r\ntoo. In making a choice between the raiments of a ballet dancer and\r\nthose of an Eskimo lady, I'd point the finger of approval toward the\r\nlatter--at least at those times when the thermometer is lounging around\r\nthe zero point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE THIN GIRL\r\n\r\n                                \"Beauty gives\r\n    The features perfectness, and to the form\r\n    Its delicate proportions.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Willis._\r\n\r\n\r\nDiogenes and his lantern had an easy, simple task. If they had started\r\nout together to turn their searchlight of discovery upon a woman who\r\nwas neither too fat nor too thin, no doubt they'd been poking around in\r\nother people's affairs ever since. I once heard of a woman to whom the\r\nidea of gaining or reducing flesh had never occurred, but she died\r\nbefore I got a chance to look at her, so of course I am rather doubtful\r\nas to the truth of the story. To my mind she should have been made\r\npresident of something or other or else been put on exhibition where\r\nthe rest of suffering womankind could have gone and feasted their eyes\r\nupon such an impossible paragon. If there is not a general wail about\r\nover-weight or under-weight, then it's a thin neck, or big hips, or an\r\ninclination to too much \"tum-tum,\" or skinny arms, or cheeks like\r\nminiature pumpkins--and goodness only knows what else. And by the time\r\none particular horror is massaged out of existence another crops up\r\nlike a spook in the closet of a \"fraidy-cat\" girl, and then the\r\nbusiness is begun all over again.\r\n\r\nTherefore, say I this: Don't worry yourself into your grave about too\r\nmuch flesh or a lack of it unless you find yourself taking on the\r\nextreme proportions of a skeleton lady, or a museum exhibit of unusual\r\nplumpness. A thin neck may be a bad thing--as all girls so afflicted\r\ncan testify--but if that thin neck is rebellious, and pays absolutely\r\nno attention to tonics or massage or other coddling for which it should\r\nrightly be grateful, then merely say, \"All right, if you insist!\" And\r\nturn your attention to other things. What admirer of feminine beauty\r\nwould not look upon a bright mind, quick, kindly wits, and sweet\r\nlovableness as a thousand times more acceptable than a neck as round\r\nand perfect as that of a Venus?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, let me say that, if you will merely look after your\r\nhealth--exercise every day, be out of doors, eat proper foods and take\r\nyour daily sponge bath--you will keep your chest broad and full, and\r\nyour waist trim and neat. Breathing exercises every morning are\r\nexcellent for this happy condition of affairs. It is my firm belief\r\nthat women could mold their bodies as they would if they only had\r\npatience and perseverance--not so much in flesh-gaining or\r\nflesh-losing, but in being wholesomely strong and healthy. This is most\r\nnecessary, not only to prolong life and make it pleasanter and more\r\nlivable in every way, but to be what God evidently intended--a robust,\r\nwell-developed and perfectly formed woman.\r\n\r\nThin girls must be lazy and plump ones busy. If you work hard and have\r\nthe usual load of worries that half the women lug about with them as\r\nthey do their powder rags and their purses, then you may never hope to\r\nrevel in a vast amount of fat. Fretters are invariably thin; they\r\nsimply worry off the flesh faster than nature can create it.\r\n\r\nWhen a woman is unusually slender it is her duty to get fat, not any\r\nmore for the reason that she will look prettier with the angles filled\r\nout than for the reason that she will be stronger and healthier and in\r\na better condition to resist illness and fatigue. She should have at\r\nleast ten hours' sleep out of twenty-four, and this must be healthy\r\nsleep in a well-ventilated bedroom, on a hard mattress, and with no\r\nhigh pillows to make her stoop-shouldered and of ungainly figure. A nap\r\nduring the day is a good thing if one can afford the time. Absolute\r\nfreedom from care and anxiety are necessary, but--alas--we cannot\r\nalways regulate the antics of fate or circumstances that deny us these\r\nsweet privileges. The diet must be of the most nourishing, and should\r\nconsist mostly of food containing starch and sugar, such as good fresh\r\nbutter, rich milk, cream, fruits both raw and cooked, macaroni, fish,\r\ncorn, sweet potatoes, peas, beans, ice creams, desserts without\r\npastries, and nourishing broths. Cereals, poultry, game, chocolate and\r\nsweet grapes are all excellent. Avoid all spiced, acid or very salty\r\nfoods. While plenty of outdoor life is most essential, a great deal of\r\nexercise is not. If there is any internal disease, especially the\r\nslightest inclination to dyspepsia or liver trouble, one cannot\r\npossibly gain flesh until the cause of the extreme slenderness is\r\nremoved. When the body is plump in one part and fails in another,\r\neither massage or a gymnastic course is advised. Dumb-bells and Indian\r\nclubs will develop the arms; massage with a fattening emollient,\r\ntogether with loose clothing, tepid baths and breathing exercises, will\r\nincrease the size of the chest and bust, while swimming, moderate\r\nbicycling and walking are good for nearly all plaints of the thin lady.\r\n\r\nBut until these changes are brought about--and it will take lots of\r\ntime--do not fret or worry. Merely wear your clothing very loose,\r\nsubstitute a comfortable little waist for stiff, unwieldy corsets, and\r\nsee that your gowns are made full and dainty. In this last particular\r\nyou will have an immense advantage over the woman who would sell the\r\nshoes off her feet to be thin and \"willowy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE PLUMP GIRL\r\n\r\n    \"What's female beauty but an air divine,\r\n    Through which the mind's all-gentle graces shine?\r\n    They, like the sun, irradiate all between;\r\n    The body charms, because the soul is seen.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Young._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf one had to choose between being too fat or too lean, the wise woman\r\nwould certainly take the smaller allowance of flesh. Jack Sprat might\r\nincite pleasant ridicule, but Jack Sprat's wife--lo! there would be\r\nnaught but pity and tears for her! It is better by far to be the butt\r\nof jokes concerning \"walking shoestrings\" or \"perambulating umbrella\r\ncases\" than to waddle through life burdened to death with an excessive\r\namount of flesh. The thin sister can pad out the angles, put frills and\r\npuffy things over the bony places, but alas for the fat one! She gets\r\ninto clothes that are skin-tight, and she draws in her corset string\r\nuntil it snaps and gives at every breath and sneeze, and even then she\r\ndoes not look graceful and pretty, for the fat--like secrets--will out,\r\nand it rolls over and around like the little bumps and humps in a\r\npudding bag.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LADY NAYLOR-LELAND]\r\n\r\nYet, after all, there's more hope for her than for her sister in\r\nmisery. While some thin girls might revel in cod liver oil and nearly\r\nconvert themselves into a hospital storeroom of tonics and fattening\r\nfoods, they can't get round and rotund--the Lord seems to will it that\r\ncertain persons are to amble disconsolately through life minus the\r\nproper allotment of flesh. But with the overplump lady it all lies\r\nwithin herself as to whether she is to be stout and buxom or of more\r\nartistic and beautiful proportions. It is simply a matter of getting up\r\nand hustling, a condition of animation frequently foreign to her\r\nnature, but not at all impossible to even the most unwieldy.\r\n\r\nWhile a certain careful routine of living is necessary for a speedy\r\nchange for the better, the two main points to remember are diet and\r\nexercise. To the girl who says: \"But I can't diet. I get hungry. I love\r\nsweets and goodies, and have to have them,\" I must reply: \"Well, then,\r\nbe fat.\" What is worth having is worth working for, and the woman who\r\nis too fat for her own comfort and personal appearance invariably has\r\nahead of her the dreadful bogy of additional flesh as the years go on.\r\nAnd surely that should be enough to inspire her to mend her ways.\r\n\r\nIn beginning the change--that is, in starting out on a regular system\r\nof dieting and exercising--you should remember that the reform must be\r\nworked gradually. One must go slowly into the more healthful manner of\r\nliving. The severe methods of flesh-reducing cannot be too greatly\r\ndeplored, and many a woman has lost her life by these extreme measures.\r\nI do not mean that they have died at their exercisers or that they fell\r\nexhausted because they did not have enough to eat, but that in their\r\nmad efforts to become thin quickly they undermined their health and\r\nlaid a good foundation for physical disorders. Good health, with too\r\nmuch plumpness, is preferable to beautiful proportions and the\r\nlistlessness and pain of ill health. So you can follow my advice with\r\nthe greatest safety, as health--to my way of thinking--is greater than\r\nbeauty, for the last depends upon the first, invariably.\r\n\r\nTo-morrow, when you get up, throw on a loose, warm wrapper, and then\r\nopen the window. Stand in the cool, crisp morning air, and expand your\r\nlungs a dozen times, holding your hands on your hips and raising\r\nyourself lightly on your toes. Vary this by walking across the room,\r\ntaking long, full breaths from the abdomen. This practice is equally\r\ngood for the thin girl, or any other kind of a girl, for that matter.\r\nAfter airing your lungs close the window and run into the bath-room,\r\nwhere you should have a quick sponge bath, rubbing the body briskly\r\nwith a heavy towel. A quick alcohol rub can follow, just as one\r\npleases. For breakfast let there be fresh uncooked fruit, especially\r\noranges. Tea or coffee must be taken clear, as neither milk nor sugar\r\nshould be indulged in by the beauty patient whose chief ambition it is\r\nto lose flesh. Toast must always be eaten instead of bread, and butter\r\nused sparingly at all times. Avoid fats, starchy cereals,\r\nflesh-producing vegetables and pastries. This is very simple, when you\r\nonce make up your mind to it. Do not fancy you are thus left with\r\nnothing whatever to eat--like Mother Hubbard's unhappy dog. Meats,\r\neither cold or broiled, are good if eaten in moderation. Poultry, fish\r\nand game are all right. Asparagus, string beans, spinach and tomatoes\r\nare the most appetizing of vegetables, and in these four alone there\r\nwill be sufficient variety, especially when salads of all sorts are\r\nincluded, although these must, of course, be taken without oil. Young\r\nonions are also excellent, as are condiments, dried fruits and\r\nacidulated drinks. A hot lemonade, taken every night, is good, but it\r\nmust have little sugar, else the effects of the acid will be\r\noverbalanced.\r\n\r\nAs for exercise, walking is best of all. Running is very beneficial,\r\nbut the unique witticisms of the average small boy will probably keep\r\nthis form of exercise confined strictly to the house. Begin by walking\r\nhalf a mile for several days, then make the distance a mile, and keep\r\nincreasing your daily walk until you cover at least five miles. That\r\nmay sound like an impossibility, but don't you believe it, for it's not\r\nat all. In Great Britain a walk of fifteen miles is not considered half\r\nan effort, and who does not know that the English girls have the most\r\nsuperb complexions in the world? Besides this, they are healthy,\r\nwholesome, well-developed women, and that counts a good deal in the\r\nrace for beauty. If the five-mile walk is too exhausting, then take a\r\nlonger time getting to the point, when it will be exhilarating instead\r\nof enervating.\r\n\r\nSleep must be limited to seven hours, and daily naps are strictly\r\ntabooed. To those who prefer, mechanical massage can be given, and this\r\nwill take the place of long walks, although they are really preferable,\r\nas the fresh air is necessary. Oxygen destroys or burns out carbon, and\r\ncarbon is fat. The more exercise and fresh air, the more oxygen, and\r\nconsequently destruction of fat by the one healthy means of remedying\r\nobesity. Soda phosphates and the various fat-reducing preparations are\r\nnot desirable. The only way to cajole willowiness of body into coming\r\nin your direction is to diet and to take plenty of exercise. Do not\r\ndrink much water. A little lemon juice added to it will make it less\r\nfattening.\r\n\r\nThere, now, plump lady, are your rules! Abide by them and your woes\r\nwill surely disappear with a swiftness that will make you laugh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE WORKING GIRL\r\n\r\n    \"Labor is life!--'Tis the still water faileth;\r\n    Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth;\r\n    Keep the watch wound, or the dark rust assaileth.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Mrs. Frances S. Osgood._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has often occurred to me that there are a vast number of plucky\r\nlittle bread-winning girls and women to whom even a tiny jar of creme\r\nmarquise is a hopeless impossibility. For them is this chapter written.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we all feel pretty sure that--in the great,\r\nwonderful beginning of things--it was never meant that women should\r\nwork. We can't help knowing this when we look about us every night at\r\nsix o'clock and see the weary, patient, brave little faces that line\r\neither side of the elevated trains or the crowded street cars. Women\r\nare not given to the solving of problems, so we won't go into the great\r\n\"whys\" or the \"wherefores.\" That's a loss of time anyhow. But we will\r\ndo heaps better than that. We will try to be hopeful and cheery, and\r\nlearn how to make the best of the little happinesses that do come our\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe working girl--and we all take off our hats to her pluck--needs more\r\nthan any other class of womankind to take care of her health. She is\r\nout in all kinds of weather, she works hard, and ofttimes struggles\r\nthrough a daily routine that is harrowing beyond everything. After\r\nhours there is mending to be done, or a thousand and one little duties\r\nto keep her busy until, tired out and nerve-weary, she goes to bed to\r\ngain rest and strength for the struggles of the morrow. She cannot\r\nafford the little luxuries of the toilet that are so dear and near to\r\nthe heart of womankind the world over. The joys of having her hair\r\n\"done\" or her pretty cheeks massaged are not hers--and the pity of it\r\nis that often enough the fault lies not within herself, but in the\r\nunhappy circumstances of fate that have placed her among the less\r\nfortunate sisterhood.\r\n\r\nLet a large bar of castile soap be the working girl's first investment.\r\nI say a \"large\" bar for the reason that it is much cheaper when bought\r\nthat way. A good-sized piece of the pure white castile can be bought at\r\nsome of the drug stores for fifteen or twenty cents. This should be cut\r\ninto small cakes and put on a high shelf, where it will become dry and\r\nhard and so it will be more lasting. With plenty of warm water, a few\r\ngood wash-rags and this pure soap you will have a beauty outfit that\r\nwill be more beneficial than all the rouges and eyebrow pencils that\r\nwere ever put into the windows of beauty shops.\r\n\r\nThe bath should be daily. Now do not say that you have not the time,\r\nfor the sponge bath--which will make the blood tingle and the flesh\r\nglow--can be got through with in almost no time. It is most imperative\r\nthat the secretions of the skin and the dust gathered during the day\r\nshould be removed. When the body is not kept scrupulously clean the\r\ncomplexion is sure to suffer, for there the pores of the skin are most\r\nsusceptible, and eruptions and blackheads come from very slight causes.\r\nWhen the hands become rough and tender, and will not stand soap,\r\nprepare a little almond meal. This, too, is very inexpensive, for,\r\ninstead of the powdered almonds, you can use the pressed almond cake,\r\nwhich is nearly as good and very cheap, and in place of the orris root\r\nwheat flour can be used. Take three ounces of the first and seven of\r\nthe latter. If you can afford it, add a little powdered talcum. A cream\r\nfor the face and hands, and one which can be used with perfect safety,\r\nis benzoinated mutton tallow. This is simply the best mutton tallow to\r\nwhich benzoin has been added, and both ingredients kept at a steady\r\nheat until the alcohol of the benzoin has been completely evaporated.\r\n\r\nAbout the hair: The greatest secret of luxuriant locks is absolute\r\ncleanliness. There are many women who vainly fancy that they keep their\r\npretty locks perfectly clean, when they really do not at all. Only\r\nplenty of running water can thoroughly rinse the soap or shampoo out.\r\nIf the hair is at all sticky, or if a slight oily substance adheres to\r\nthe comb, then the hair is not clean. (And let me say right here, combs\r\nand brushes too must be kept as scrupulously clean as the hair itself.)\r\nCastile soap makes the best shampoo in the world, especially when a\r\nlittle piece is dissolved in warm water and a tiny bit of ammonia or\r\nalcohol added, although for dry hair neither the alcohol nor ammonia is\r\nat all necessary. If a tonic is needed, then use the sage tea, which,\r\nhowever, must not be put on light, blond tresses. Common kerosene, if\r\none can endure the odor, is an unsurpassed remedy for falling hair.\r\nRubbing the scalp every night with the finger tips until the flesh\r\ntingles and glows is a most inexpensive way of stimulating the\r\ncirculation, and frequently makes the hair grow long and nice and fine.\r\n\r\nWhat one eats plays such a leading part in the beauty-getting\r\nefforts--but I have but little space left now to tell about that.\r\nSummed up in a nutshell, it is this: Eat very little pastry, and shun\r\ngreasy foods or fat meats, like pork or bacon. Pin your faith to\r\nvegetables and fruit. A luncheon of two apples is of greater\r\nnourishment, and more, real value to good looks, than a repast of mince\r\npie and coffee--two unspeakable horrors to any one who regards health\r\nand beauty as worth the having or the striving for.\r\n\r\nAs for the dress, I could write a seven volume treatise on that. It\r\nsounds prosy, I know, and very stupid, but let me tell you that it is\r\nthe wise girl who buys for comfort, utility and wear, instead of style\r\nand elaborateness. A plain little fedora, if well brushed, makes a\r\ntrimmer, neater appearance than a cheap velvet hat ornamented with\r\nfeathers that have straightened out and flowers that have long since\r\nlost their glory in the rains and storms of autumn time. It is the same\r\nway with shoes and gloves. If one can possibly afford it, calfskin\r\nboots and heavy gloves should always be purchased. They will not only\r\noutwear two or three pairs of the lighter, less durable kind, but they\r\nwill give warmth and comfort and a well-groomed look as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE NERVOUS ONE\r\n\r\n    \"The beautiful seems right by force of beauty; and the feeble\r\n    wrong because of weakness.\"--_Elizabeth Barrett Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the unfortunates on the face of the globe there is none so\r\nworthy of real all-wool pity and yard-wide sympathy as the woman of\r\nnerves. Yes, and her family needs a dash of consolation, too. One\r\nnervous woman can create more nervousness among other women than could\r\na cageful of mice or a colony of cows suddenly let loose. It is not for\r\nherself that the fuss-budget should mend her ways, but for the great\r\ngood of humanity at large.\r\n\r\nWe are all of us more or less nervous, and it is really interesting to\r\nobserve what strange outlets woman's natural nervousness chooses.\r\n\r\n\"I'd walk from Hyde Park to the city hall at midnight and never be a\r\nbit scared. But let me stay in the flat alone after dark and I'm in a\r\nstate of terror that would make you weep were you to behold me,\"\r\nconfesses nervous lady No. 1.\r\n\r\n\"I have nerves of iron,\" pipes up nervous lady No. 2. \"Except when\r\nthere is a thunderstorm. Then I wish I were as dead as Julius Caesar.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" drawls nervous lady No. 3. \"I don't believe in ghosts at all,\r\nbut I'm scared to death of 'em. Sometimes I not only keep the gas\r\nburning all night, but I sit up in bed so as to be right ready to run\r\naway from 'em.\"\r\n\r\nSome people have contempt for the nervous ones. I have only pity. Any\r\none who has gone through the tortures of hearing imaginary burglars\r\nthree nights in the week for ten or twelve years on an endless stretch\r\nneeds consolation and then a good, straight talk on the beautiful\r\nconvenience of horse sense. Most women are always hearing burglars.\r\nProbably one in a thousand turns out to be a real, live housebreaker.\r\nWhenever the wise woman hears one fussing with the lock on the front\r\ndoor or trying to squeeze into the pantry window, she just says: \"Same\r\nold burglar. He'll be gone in the morning,\" and he always is. That's a\r\nheap better plan than arousing the household and suffering the\r\nunmerciful torture that a family given to ridicule can inflict.\r\n\r\nI heard a woman say the other day that she never knew what it was to be\r\nnervous until a certain ragman began to take pedestrian exercises up\r\nand down the alley back of her house. He carries a canvas bag over his\r\nshoulder, and he yells \"Eny ol' racks\" until that woman locks herself\r\nin a closet and stuffs sofa cushions into her ears. His \"Eny ol' racks\"\r\nhas got on her nerves so that she is simply beside herself until that\r\nman takes himself and his yell out of hearing distance. To be sure, he\r\nyells through his nose, but why in the world that woman should make\r\nherself miserable about something she can't possibly help is a\r\ndouble-turreted mystery to me. The thing for her to do is to sit down\r\nplacidly on the back porch and make up her mind that the ragman is not\r\ngoing to upset the tranquillity of her existence; that he hasn't any\r\nright to interfere with her happiness, and that she isn't going to be\r\nfool enough to let him. I'll wager a peseta against a gum drop that she\r\ncould do it, too, and without half an effort, if she would only once be\r\nconsistent and determined.\r\n\r\nThere is no use in beating about the bush. I feel sorry for the nervous\r\nwoman at all times and every day in the week, but there's no chance of\r\na doubt that the nervous woman is mentally unbalanced for want of\r\ncourage and lack of will power. Some place, way back in the far corners\r\nof her intellect, there are numerous little sore spots that need the\r\nhealing tonic of level-headedness and the bravery of belief in her own\r\nstrength. Those wise gentlemen of pellets and pills tell us that when\r\nthere is a defect in the structure of the nervous system, some certain\r\nregion of cells not well flushed with blood is usually at the bottom of\r\nthe infirmity. The cure, they say, is discipline and training, good\r\nfood, exercise and plenty of sleep and good fresh air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. J. R. DE LAMAR]\r\n\r\nSunlight is a glorious medicine for the woman of nerves. If I had a\r\nnervous fuss-budget under my care, the first thing I would do would be\r\nto feed her well. I'd give her nourishing broths and daintily-served\r\nvegetables, and little steaks and chops and plenty of fattening cereals\r\nand drinks. I would bundle her off to the parks every morning with\r\nsealed orders not to come back until she was dead tired and as hungry\r\nas a small girl at a boarding school. I would impress upon her mind the\r\ngreat need of throwing worry to the winds and taking in good, long\r\nbreaths of God's blessed fresh air. Then, after feeding her some more,\r\nI'd make her take a nice, refreshing sponge bath and tumble early into\r\nbed. After several days of such treatment I'd corner her where she\r\ncouldn't get away and lay down the laws.\r\n\r\n\"Now it's just with yourself,\" the lecture would begin with, \"whether\r\nyou are to be a jolly-hearted, wholesome-looking woman or a tailor-made\r\ngown with a bundle of nerves inside of it. No matter what comes, don't\r\nmake yourself wretched by fretting. Every one has troubles. You can't\r\nescape them. Sometimes they come with a sweep-like tornadoes gone mad,\r\nand you'll say to yourself: 'My heavens! I wonder if I'll live through\r\nit all?' But you will, and between you and me, my dear, it's just as\r\nwell to come out of the battle with a smiling face as with eight\r\nadditional crow's feet and a new scolding lock of gray hair. Just say\r\nto yourself: 'I will not grind my teeth because the man next to me in\r\nthe street car is chewing a toothpick. I am not responsible for his\r\nlack of manners. I positively refuse to have fits because the woman in\r\nthe flat next to mine plays the flute eight hours a day. If it's\r\nconvenient I'll move; if it isn't I'll not make existence a daylight\r\nnightmare.'\r\n\r\n\"School yourself!\" I will continue. \"Get lots of starch in you and a\r\nbackbone that is a backbone! Don't fall down in a heap and mope over\r\nthings you can't help. The agreeable things in life are as rare as\r\nsage-brush growing in Gotham, while the disagreeable is bobbing up\r\neternally. So brace up, my friend, and make the best of it. Discipline\r\nyourself. Keep your mind fresh and bright, and your body strong and\r\nhealthy. If you have hard work to do then do it with the least possible\r\nexpenditure of worry and nerve-force. Be in the open air as much as you\r\ncan, and above everything else dwell not on the unhealthy state of your\r\nnerves. Let self-mastery be your shibboleth and 'no nerves' your\r\nprayer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PERFUMES\r\n\r\n    \"Oh, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem,\r\n    By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!\r\n    The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem,\r\n    For that sweet odor which doth in it live.\"\r\n\r\n    --_Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\nWomen love delicate perfumes as they do silk stockings and violets.\r\nIt's just \"born in 'em,\" like their deep-rooted horror of mice and\r\nbills and burglars. From the time when the baby girl sniffs the\r\nsweetness of the powder puff as it fluffs about her soft, pretty neck\r\nuntil the white-haired lady lovingly fondles the lavender sachets that\r\nlie between the folds of her time-yellowed wedding gown, she loves\r\nsweet odors.\r\n\r\nThe true gentlewoman never uses strong perfumes, yet her hats and\r\nclothing and handkerchiefs always send forth a faint scent of fragrant\r\nflowers. The odor is so very slight that it does not suggest the\r\ndashing on of perfume, but, instead, bespeaks scrupulous cleanliness of\r\nbody and garments, with perhaps an added suggestion of the soft winds\r\nthat blow over a clover field. No perfume at all is far better than too\r\nmuch, for who does not look with suspicious eyes upon the woman who,\r\nwhen passing one on the street, seems to be in an invisible vapor of\r\nwhite rose or jockey club--strong enough to work on the streets?\r\n\r\nThere is a secret about it all, and such a simple one! It is merely\r\nchoosing one particular odor and using it in every possible way. There\r\nis nothing sweeter than violet perfume, so suppose I illustrate with\r\nthat? Begin by using orris root for your teeth, combined, of course,\r\nwith the other necessary ingredients. Then, if you can afford it, get\r\nthe expensive imported violet soaps, although as a matter of\r\nbeautifying there is nothing better than the pure white castile. The\r\nodor of this, disliked by some, can be entirely done away with by using\r\na little violet toilet water in the bath and touching the ear lobes\r\nwith it afterward.\r\n\r\nThen, between the folds of your gowns and in the crowns of your hats\r\nlay little violet sachets, always removing them before the gown or hat\r\nis worn, as the perfume must be faint and delicate. A few drops of\r\nessence of violet will scent your face powder, if it is not already\r\nperfumed, and bath bags of orris--and other good things--will add to\r\nyour galaxy of sweet odors. If you use creme marquise or any of the\r\nother delightful cosmetics told about in our beauty book, add a little\r\nessence of violets to them while they are being mixed. Putting it all\r\nin a nutshell: Simply choose your favorite perfume and carry it out in\r\nevery detail. For those who are fond of violet I will give the\r\nfollowing recipes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Creme de la Violettes: Place in a porcelain kettle one ounce each\r\n    of white wax and spermaceti, cut in fine shavings. When melted add\r\n    to this five ounces oil of sweet almonds and heat, but do not let\r\n    boil. Remove from fire and pour in quickly one and one-half ounces\r\n    of rose-water in which ten grains of borax has been dissolved. Beat\r\n    briskly. When beginning to thicken, add one-half teaspoonful\r\n    essence of violets. When nearly cold put in little jars. Use as\r\n    cold cream or any general face cosmetic. It is more effective when\r\n    applied at night, just after the face is bathed in warm water and\r\n    while the flesh is pink and moist.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Perfume--Violettes de Bois:\r\n\r\n    Essence of violets, five ounces.\r\n    Essence of acacia, one ounce.\r\n    Essence of rose, one ounce.\r\n    Extract of iris root, one ounce.\r\n    Oil of bitter almonds, five drops.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Violet Lotion:\r\n\r\n    Alcohol, four ounces.\r\n    Ammonia, one ounce.\r\n    Essence of violets, one dram.\r\n\r\n    Add one teaspoonful of this to a bowl of water when bathing the\r\n    face, neck and arms. Hard water is the cause of many bad\r\n    complexions, and this will remedy that particular trouble of the\r\n    beauty-seeker.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Poudre de Vicomtesse:\r\n\r\n    Talcum powder, seven and one-half ounces.\r\n    Finest starch, one and one-fourth ounces.\r\n    Powdered orris root, one and one-fourth ounces.\r\n    Oil of orris, ten drops.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Violet Bath Bags:\r\n\r\n    Two pounds of finely ground oatmeal.\r\n    Three ounces of almond flour.\r\n    One cake of best white castile soap, shaved fine.\r\n    One-quarter pound powdered orris root.\r\n\r\n    Take one yard of cheese cloth and make it into little bags about\r\n    four inches square and fill with the mixture. These will make a\r\n    soft white lather, and afterward the face, neck and arms should be\r\n    rinsed in water containing a few drops of benzoin. Larger bags can\r\n    be made for the regular bath.\r\n\r\n\r\n    For the Teeth:\r\n\r\n    One-fourth pound of prepared chalk, finely powdered.\r\n    Three-fourths ounce pulverized castile soap.\r\n    One ounce powdered orris root.\r\n    One-half dram oil of sassafras.\r\n    One ounce pulverized sugar.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Violet Sachet:\r\n\r\n    Black currant leaves, powdered, one-fourth pound.\r\n    Rose leaves, one-fourth pound.\r\n    Cassia buds, one-eighth pound.\r\n    Orris, ground, one-half pound.\r\n    Gum benzoin, one-eighth pound.\r\n    Grain musk, powdered, one-fourth dram.\r\n    Mix thoroughly and let stand for one week.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Violet Toilet Water:\r\n\r\n    Essence of violet, one and three-fourth ounces.\r\n    Essence of rose, one-half ounce.\r\n    Essence of cassie, one-half ounce.\r\n    Alcohol, 14 ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Essence de Fleur d'Oranges:\r\n\r\n    One-half ounce pure neroli.\r\n    One pint alcohol.\r\n    One ounce essence of jonquille.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Violet Sachet Powder:\r\n\r\n    Eight ounces of orris root.\r\n    Five drops oil of bergamot.\r\n    Three drops oil of bitter almonds.\r\n    Four drops oil of rose.\r\n    One fluid dram tincture of musk.\r\n    Mix thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Lavender Sachet Powder:\r\n\r\n    One pound powdered lavender.\r\n    One-quarter pound gum benzoin (powdered).\r\n    Six ounces oil of lavender.\r\n    Mix.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Heliotrope Sachet Powder:\r\n\r\n    One-quarter pound rose leaves.\r\n    Two ounces tonquin, ground fine.\r\n    One-quarter pound pulverized orris root.\r\n    One ounce vanilla (powdered).\r\n    One-half grain musk.\r\n    Two drops oil of almonds.\r\n    Mix by fluffing through a sieve.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Woman Beautiful, by Helen Follett Stevans",
