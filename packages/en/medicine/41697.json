New York\r\n\r\n_Examinations of Water, Milk, Blood, Urine, Sputum, Pus, Food\r\nProducts, Beverages, Drugs, Minerals, Coloring Matters, etc., for\r\ndiagnostic, prophylactic, or other scientific purposes._\r\n\r\nAll analyses at these Laboratories are so conducted as to assure the\r\nbest service attainable on the basis of the latest scientific\r\ndevelopments. The laboratories are amply supplied with a perfect\r\nquality of reagent materials, and with the most efficient constructions\r\nof modern apparatus and instruments. The probable cost for some of the\r\nmost frequently needed researches is approximately indicated below:\r\n\r\n    Sputum, for tuberculosis bacilli,                         $3.00\r\n    Urine, for tuberculosis bacilli,                           3.00\r\n    Milk, for tuberculosis bacilli,                            3.00\r\n    Urine, qualitative, for one constituent,                   1.50\r\n    Urine, qualitative, for each additional constituent,       1.00\r\n    Urine, quantitative, for each constituent,                 3.00\r\n    Urine, sediment, microscopical,                            1.50\r\n    Blood, for ratio of white to red corpuscles,               2.00\r\n    Blood, for Widal's typhoid reaction,                       2.00\r\n    Water, for general fitness to drink,                      10.00\r\n    Water, for typhoid germs,                                 25.00\r\n    Water, quantitative determination of any one constituent, 10.00\r\n    Pus, for gonococci,                                        3.00\r\n\r\nThe cost for other analyses--more variable in scope--can only be given\r\nupon closer knowledge of the requirements of individual cases.\r\n\r\nAll pharmacists in every part of the United States will receive and\r\ntransmit orders for the MERCK ANALYTIC LABORATORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Physicians are earnestly requested to communicate to Merck & Co.,\r\nUniversity Place, New York, any suggestions that may tend to improve\r\nthis book for its Second Edition, which will soon be in course of\r\npreparation._\r\n\r\n_Whatever the Publishers can do to make Merck's Manual of still greater\r\nservice to the Medical Profession will be gladly undertaken and\r\npromptly performed for all subsequent editions._\r\n\r\n_Therefore, any Physician who will propose improvements in the\r\nsubject-matter (especially as regards the Newer Materia Medica), or in\r\nthe arrangement, style, and form of this work, for future editions,\r\nwill thus be rendering valuable service, not only to its Publishers,\r\nbut to the entire Profession as well!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber's Note: Minor typographical errors have been corrected\r\nwithout note.

Memory is treacherous. It is\r\nparticularly so with those who have much to do and more to think of.\r\nWhen the best remedy is wanted, to meet indications in cases that are a\r\nlittle out of the usual run, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible,\r\nto recall the whole array of available remedies so as to pick out the\r\nbest. Strange to say, too, it is the most thoroughly informed man that\r\nis likely to suffer to the greatest extent in this way; because of the\r\nvery fact that his mind is overburdened. But a mere reminder is all he\r\nneeds, to make him at once master of the situation and enable him to\r\nprescribe exactly what his judgment tells him is needed for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\nIn MERCK'S MANUAL the physician will find a complete Ready-Reference\r\nBook covering the entire eligible Materia Medica. A glance over it just\r\nbefore or just after seeing a patient will refresh his memory in a way\r\nthat will facilitate his coming to a decision. In this book, small as\r\nit is, he will find the essential data found in the ponderous\r\nDispensatories, together with the facts of newest record, which can\r\nappear only in future editions of those works.\r\n\r\nPart I affords at a glance a descriptive survey, in one alphabetic\r\nseries, of the entire Materia Medica to-day in general use by the\r\nAmerican profession. Part II contains a summary of Therapeutic\r\nIndications for the employment of remedies, arranged according to\r\nthe Pathologic Conditions to be combated. Part III presents a\r\nClassification of Medicaments in accordance with their Physiologic\r\nActions.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publishers may be allowed to state that they have labored long and\r\nearnestly, so to shape this little volume that it shall prove a firm\r\nand faithful help to the practitioner in his daily round of duty. They\r\nnow send it forth in the confident hope that, the more it is put to the\r\ntest of actual use, the more it will grow in the esteem of its\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n~Pages 9 to 82.~\r\n\r\n~Part First.--THE MATERIA MEDICA, as in actual use to-day by American\r\nPhysicians.~ (Alphabetically arranged.)\r\n\r\nTHIS PART EMBRACES all those Simple Medicinal Substances (that\r\nis, drugs and chemicals) which are in current and well-established use\r\nin the medical practice of this country; or which, if too recently\r\nintroduced to be as yet in general use, are vouched for by eminent\r\nauthorities in medical science;--also, the medicinally employed\r\nPharmaceutic Preparations recognized by the United States\r\nPharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\n    (Added thereto, for the convenience of those practitioners who\r\n    prescribe them, are Medicamentous Mixtures advertised only to the\r\n    Profession, but whose composition or mode of manufacture has not\r\n    been made known with sufficient completeness or exactness to\r\n    satisfy all members of the Profession. In the selection the\r\n    publishers have been guided solely by the recognition accorded the\r\n    various preparations by the Profession, according to the best\r\n    information obtained.)\r\n\r\nThere has also been included, under the title of \"Foods and Dietetic\r\nPreparations,\" a list of such preparations as are frequently prescribed\r\nfor infants' diet, or for the sick or convalescent.\r\n\r\nOMITTED from the Materia Medica chapter are: Medicaments that\r\nhave become obsolete, or that are too rarely used to be of general\r\ninterest; and such new remedies as are not yet safely accredited on\r\nreliable authority; also those galenic preparations (syrups, extracts,\r\npills, essences, elixirs, wines, emulsions, etc.) which are not\r\nstandardized according to the U.S. Pharmacopoeia; likewise all\r\narticles that are put up and advertised for self-medication by the\r\nlay public.\r\n\r\nSEPARATE TITLES in the alphabetic series are accorded, as a rule,\r\nto the botanical drugs and other pharmaceutical mother-substances,\r\nto proximate principles (alkaloids, glucosides, organic acids, etc.),\r\nand to chemical compounds (salts, \"synthetics,\" etc.); while the\r\nofficial galenic preparations, solutions and dilutions, derived\r\nfrom them, are mostly mentioned under the titles of their respective\r\nmother-substances. (Thus, for instance, \"Dover's Powder\" will be\r\nfound under \"Opium,\" while \"Morphine\" is described under its own\r\ntitle.)\r\n\r\n    (_Smaller type_ has been employed--in order to economize\r\n    space--for botanic drugs, gums, and some others of the older drugs\r\n    and preparations which are so long and well known that but little\r\n    reference will need be made to them.)\r\n\r\n    (Those substances of the Materia Medica which can be had of the\r\n    MERCK brand are--for the convenience of prescribers--so\r\n    designated).\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~Pages 83 to 184.~\r\n\r\n~Part Second.--THERAPEUTIC INDICATIONS for the use of the Materia\r\nMedica and other agents.~ (Arranged alphabetically under the titles\r\nof the various Pathologic Conditions.)\r\n\r\nTHIS PART SUMMARIZES in brief form, the principal means of\r\ntreatment for each form of disease, as reported to be in good use with\r\npractitioners at the present time. The statements hereon are drawn from\r\nthe standard works of the leading modern writers on Therapeutics, and\r\nsupplemented--in the case of definite chemicals of more recent\r\nintroduction--by the reports of reputable clinical investigators.\r\n\r\n                 *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n~Pages 185 to 192.~\r\n\r\n~Part Third.--CLASSIFICATION OF MEDICAMENTS according to their\r\nPhysiologic Actions.~ (Arranged alphabetically under the titles of\r\nthe Actions.)\r\n\r\nTHIS PART RECAPITULATES, for ready survey, such statements as\r\nare already given in \"PART I,\" as to the modes of action of\r\nthe various medicaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE MATERIA MEDICA, as in actual use to-day by American\r\n    Physicians.
