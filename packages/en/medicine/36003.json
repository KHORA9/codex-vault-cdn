It demonstrates once more the truth\r\nof the scientific principle, that the truth or falsity of any theory or\r\nworking hypothesis becomes more and more demonstrable the further its\r\napplication is attempted in the explanation of new lines of facts. The\r\ntruth of the degeneracy doctrine had forced itself on the writer long\r\nbefore its popular apotheosis under Lombroso and Nordau, because it alone\r\nsufficed for an explanation of constitutional and local defects\r\n(encountered in a seemingly limited speciality of medicine), which local\r\ncauses failed entirely to explain. The investigations thereon resultant\r\nhave appeared in medical and dental journals for the past two decades. The\r\npresent work is chiefly based on these researches. At the same time, the\r\nauthor has drawn largely from all fields of biology cultivated by European\r\ninvestigators, while he must acknowledge a particular indebtedness to the\r\ninvestigations (of which he has made large use beside that elsewhere\r\nspecifically acknowledged) of certain American investigators--Rush,\r\nParkmen, Ray, G. Frank Lydston, C. L. Dana, C. F. Folsom, W. W. Godding,\r\nE. C. Spitzka, E. D. Cope, D. R. Brower, Marsh, B. Sachs, Harriet C. B.\r\nAlexander, Clara Barrus, H. M. Bannister, Delia E. Howe, Grace Peckham,\r\nAdolph Meyer, Kerlin, Wiley, J. G. Kiernan, W. E. Allison, Osborn, R.\r\nDewey, Frederick Peterson, Gihon, Cowles, W. A. Hammond, A. B. Holder, C.\r\nH. Hughes, F. W. Starr, F. C. Hoyt, J. H. McBride, C. K. Mills, C. B.\r\nBurr, T. D. Crothers, W. S. Christopher, W. X. Sudduth, A. Lagorio, J.\r\nWorkman, Wilmarth, and others. These scientists had raised an exceedingly\r\nstable foundation for the doctrine of degeneracy long before Lombroso and\r\nNordau (forcing one phase of the subject into popular recognition)\r\ncompelled an examination of the entire doctrine.\r\n\r\nThe work has been written with a special intention of reaching educators\r\nand parents. With this object, it has avoided laying stress on any one\r\ncause of degeneracy, and ignoring factors which produce it and are\r\naggravated by it. The doctrinaire reformer will here find no support for\r\nany limited theory. While it does not pretend in the slightest degree to\r\ngive all the details of degeneracy, it attempts to lay down general\r\nprinciples for practical purposes in a way that permits their application\r\nto the solution of sociologic problems.\r\n\r\nFrom a sense of scientific accuracy no attempts have been made to\r\ndemarcate, rigidly, abnormality from disease, or atavism from arrested\r\ndevelopment, except as may be done by the features of the cases in which\r\nthe terms are used. The guiding principle adopted has been that the\r\nfactors of degeneracy affect in the ancestor the checks on excessive\r\naction acquired during the evolution of the race, thus producing a state\r\nof nervous exhaustion. The descendant in consequence is unable to reach\r\nthe state of the ancestor thus nervously exhausted.\r\n\r\nFor the illustrations, other than those that are original, the author is\r\nindebted to the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, _Dental\r\nCosmos_, _The International Dental Journal_, _The St. Louis Clinical\r\nRecord_, to M.

With that stage of development of the religious sense marked by\r\nassigning malign occult powers to natural objects and forces, this view of\r\ndegeneracy became systematised, and exposed weakly or deformed offspring,\r\ncharged to evil powers, to death. This occult conception of degeneracy is\r\neven yet a part of American folklore. Against degenerate children charms\r\nare still used by the \"witch-doctors\" among the \"Pennsylvania Dutch.\"\r\nThese people are on the level of culture of the early seventeenth century\r\nmiddle class English, if not a little below it. The folklore of these, as\r\nembodied in Shakespeare, demonstrates, according to J. G. Kiernan,[1] that\r\nere the seventeenth century the fact that \"mental and moral defect\r\nexpressed itself in physical stigmata was recognised and even the term\r\nused.\" Thistleton Dyer[2] remarks that it is an old prejudice, not yet\r\nextinct, that those who are defective or deformed are marked by nature as\r\nprone to mischief. Thus in _King Richard III._ (i. 3) Margaret calls\r\nRichard--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou elvish-marked, abortive, rooting hog!\r\n  Thou that wast sealed in thy nativity\r\n  The slave of nature and the son of hell!\"\r\n\r\nShe calls him hog in allusion to his cognisance, which was a boar. A\r\npopular expression in Shakespeare's day for a deformed person was\r\n\"stigmatic.\" It denoted any one who had been stigmatised or burnt with\r\niron (an ignominious punishment), and hence was employed to represent a\r\nperson on whom nature had set a mark of deformity. Thus in the Third Part\r\nof _Henry VI._ (ii. 2) Queen Margaret says--\r\n\r\n  \"But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;\r\n  But like a foul misshapen stigmatic,\r\n  Marked by the destinies to be avoided,\r\n  As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.\"\r\n\r\nAgain in the Second Part of _Henry VI._ (v. 1) young Clifford says to\r\nRichard--\r\n\r\n  \"Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.\"\r\n\r\nIn _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ (v. 1) Oberon wards off degeneracy from the\r\nissue of the happy lovers by the following charm--\r\n\r\n  \"And the blots of Nature's hand\r\n  Shall not in their issue stand;\r\n  Never mole, hare-lip nor scar,\r\n  Nor mark prodigious, such as are\r\n  Despised in nativity,\r\n  Shall upon their children be.\"\r\n\r\nConstant allusions to this subject occur in old writers, showing how\r\nstrong was the belief of the early English on this point. King John (iv.\r\n2) calls Hubert, the supposed murderer of Prince Arthur,--\r\n\r\n  \"A fellow by the hand of Nature marked,\r\n  Quoted and signed to do a deed of shame.\"\r\n\r\nConcerning this adaptation of the mind to the deformity of the body\r\nFrancis Bacon remarks: \"Deformed persons are commonly even with Nature,\r\nfor as Nature hath done ill by them so do they by Nature, being void of\r\nnatural affection, and so they have their revenge on Nature.\"\r\n\r\nThe quaint old \"Anatomist of Melancholy,\"[3] Burton, seems but to\r\nparaphrase modern curers of degeneracy when, at the end of his chapter on\r\nthe inheritance of defects, he remarks concerning this fetichistic notion:\r\n\"So many several ways are we plagued and published for our father's\r\ndefaults; in so much that as Fernelius truly saith: 'It is the greatest\r\npart of our felicity to be well born, and it were happy for human kind, if\r\nonly such parents as are sound of body and mind should be suffered to\r\nmarry.' An husbandman will sow none but the best and choicest seed upon\r\nhis land, he will not rear a bull or an horse, except he be right shapen\r\nin all parts, or permit him to cover a mare, except he be well assured of\r\nhis breed; we make choice of the best rams for our sheep, rear the neatest\r\nkine, and keep the best dogs, _quanto id diligentius in procreandis\r\nliberis observandum_! And how careful, then, should we be in begetting of\r\nour children! In former times some countries have been so chary in this\r\nbehalf, so stern, that if a child were crooked or deformed in body or\r\nmind, they made him away; so did the Indians of old by the relation of\r\nCurtius, and many other well-governed commonwealths according to the\r\ndiscipline of those times. 'Heretofore in Scotland,' saith Hect Boethius,\r\n'if any were visited with the falling sickness, madness, gout, leprosy, or\r\nany such dangerous disease which was likely to be propagated from the\r\nfather to the son, he was instantly gelded; a woman kept from all company\r\nof men; and if by chance having some such disease she were found to be\r\nwith child, she with her brood were buried alive'; and this was done for\r\nthe common good, lest the whole nation should be injured or corrupted. A\r\nsevere doom, you will say, and not to be used amongst Christians, yet more\r\nto be looked into than it is. For now by our too much facility in this\r\nkind, in giving way for all to marry that will, too much liberty and\r\nindulgence in tolerating all sorts, there is a vast confusion of\r\nhereditary diseases, no family secure, no man almost free, from some\r\ngrievous infirmity or other, when no choice is had, but still the eldest\r\nmust marry, as so many stallions of the race; or if rich, be they fools or\r\ndizzards, lame or maimed, unable, intemperate, dissolute, exhaust through\r\nriot, as he said, they must be wise and able by inheritance. It comes to\r\npass that our generation is corrupt, we have many weak persons both in\r\nbody and mind, many feral diseases raging among us, crazed families; our\r\nfathers bad, and we are like to be worse.\"\r\n\r\nThis conception gradually developed into the widespread myth of a\r\nprimevally perfect man through the natural operation of that\r\npsychological law whereby, as Macaulay remarks, society, constantly moving\r\nforward with eager speed, is as constantly looking backward with tender\r\nregret. They turn their eyes and see a lake where an hour before they were\r\ntoiling through sand.\r\n\r\nFrom this view came the belief that man as existing is degenerate. This\r\ndegeneracy, while popularly charged to occult influences, was early\r\nascribed by scientists to physical causes. Aristotle, as Osborn[4] points\r\nout, appears to have recognised degeneration or the gradual decline of\r\nstructures in form and usefulness, in his analysis of \"movement\" in\r\nconnection with development. Degeneration is first met with as a term in\r\nan explanation of the origin of species by Buffon in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. The conception itself occurs in a criticism by Sylvius of\r\nVesalius (1514-64), who had asserted that the anatomy of Galen could not\r\nhave been founded upon the human body, because he had described an\r\nintermaxillary bone. This bone, Vesalius observed, is found in the lower\r\nanimals but not in man. Sylvius (1614-72) defends Galen on the ground that\r\nthough man had no intermaxillary bone at present this is no proof of its\r\nabsence in Galen's time. \"It is luxury, it is sensuality, which has\r\ngradually deprived man of this bone.\" This passage, as Osborn remarks,\r\nproves that the idea of degeneration of structures through disuse, as well\r\nas the idea of the inheritance of the effect of habit, or the\r\n\"transmission of acquired characters,\" is a very ancient one. Sylvius,\r\nwhile here recognising factors of degeneracy, erred in considering\r\ndisappearance of the intermaxillary bone, not reappearance, as\r\ndegeneracy. He failed to recognise, moreover, the law of economy of growth\r\nby which one structure is sacrificed for another or for the organism as a\r\nwhole. This law, indicated by Aristotle, but clearly outlined by Goethe in\r\n1807, and Geoffroy St. Hilaire in 1818, underlies the physiological\r\natrophies and hypertrophies which play such a part in degeneracy.\r\n\r\nThe _Twelve Caesars_ of Suetonius (that stud book of imperial degeneracy as\r\nit has been styled) stamps the decided impression on its readers that\r\nHippocratian notions of degenerate heredity strongly permeated Roman\r\nthought, to revive in those Arabic, Italian, and British (Roger Bacon)\r\nthinkers who created the scientific phase of the revival of learning.\r\n\r\nIn the science of medicine, as developed by Hippocrates,[5] the modern\r\nconception of degeneracy is evident. Hippocrates argues against the\r\n\"sacred\" nature of epilepsy, since it is a hereditary disease and hence\r\ncomes under the operation of physical law. He furthermore points out, as\r\ndid Aristotle, that epilepsy produced in the ancestor by traumatism and\r\nother physical causes may be inherited by the child.\r\n\r\nAs the degeneration phase of evolution was less antagonistic to the\r\nreligious theory forced into biblical dogma by the Jesuit Suarez (in\r\nopposition to the evolutionary views of St. Augustine and St. Thomas\r\nAquinas), being supported by biblical dicta (that when the fathers had\r\neaten sour grapes the children's teeth were set on edge) and fetichistic\r\nfolklore, it retained a dominance that the advanced phase lost. From the\r\ntime of Hippocrates, psychiatry (the science devoted to mental disorders)\r\ncontinued to accumulate data of the origin and transmission of human\r\ndefects. The impetus given the evolutionary explanation of these data by\r\nthe seventeenth and eighteenth century biologists (Harvey, Buffon,\r\nLamarck, Erasmus Darwin, and others) laid the foundation for the modern\r\ndoctrine of degeneracy.\r\n\r\nBuffon[6] remarks that many species are being perfected or degenerated by\r\nthe great changes in land and sea, by the favours or disfavours of Nature,\r\nby food, by the prolonged influences of climate, contrary or favourable,\r\nand are no longer what they formerly were. He regarded temperature, food,\r\nand climate as the three great factors in the alteration and degeneration\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin[7] considers that all life starts from a living filament\r\nhaving the capability of being excited into action by certain stimuli.\r\nThis capability is that whereby plants and animals react to their\r\nenvironment, causing changes in them which are transmitted to their\r\noffspring. All animals undergo transformations which are in part produced\r\nby their own exertions in response to pleasures and pains, and many of\r\nthese acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity.\r\nOther effects of this excitability (such as constitute hereditary\r\ndiseases, like scrofula, epilepsy, insanity) have their origin in one or\r\nperhaps two generations, as in the progeny of those who drink much vinous\r\nspirits. Those hereditary propensities cease again if one or two sober\r\ngenerations succeed, otherwise the family becomes extinct.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Rush[8] (greatly influenced by the Erasmus Darwin school)\r\nremarks that through hereditary sameness of organisation of the nerves,\r\nbrain and blood vessels, the predisposition to insanity pervades whole\r\nfamilies and renders them liable to this disease from a transient and\r\nfeeble operation of its causes. Insanity when hereditary is excited by\r\nmore feeble causes than in persons in whom this predisposition has been\r\nacquired. It generally attacks the descendants in those stages of life in\r\nwhich it has appeared in the ancestors. Children born previously to the\r\nattack of madness in their parents are less liable to inherit it than\r\nthose who are born after it. Children born of parents who are in the\r\ndecline of life are more predisposed to insanity than children born under\r\ncontrary circumstances. A predisposition to certain diseases, seated in\r\nparts contiguous to the seat of insanity, often descends from parents to\r\ntheir children. Thus it occurs in a son whose father or mother has been\r\nafflicted only with hysteria or habitual headaches. The reverse likewise\r\ntakes place. There are families in which insanity has existed where the\r\ndisease has spared the mind in the posterity, but appeared in great\r\nstrength and eccentricity of the memory and of the passions, or in great\r\nperversion of their moral faculties. Sometimes it passes by all the\r\nfaculties of the mind, and appears only in the nervous system of persons\r\ndescended from deranged parents; again, madness occurs in children whose\r\nparents were remarkable only for eccentricity of mind. Among the diseases\r\nthat attack the children of the insane, but did not exist in their\r\nancestors, are consumption and epilepsy.\r\n\r\nSimilar studies were later published by Pinel, Tissot, Chiarrurgi,\r\nStedman, Parkman, Brigham, Prichard, Esquirol, Jacobi, and other\r\nAmerican, English, French, Italian, and German alienists. Based upon the\r\ndata thus obtained, and upon the general principles thus outlined, then\r\nappeared--nearly at the same time as the like epoch-making work (on\r\nanother phase of evolution), Darwin's _Origin of Species_--Morel's\r\n_Treatise on Human Degeneracy_, wherein the principle of natural selection\r\nwas shown to involve the recognition of the physical conditions that\r\nconstitute degeneracy, and, necessarily, to exclude primeval perfection.\r\nMorel's definition of degeneration as a marked departure from the original\r\ntype tending more or less rapidly to the extinction of it, forms the basis\r\nof commonly accepted definitions.\r\n\r\nWhile Morel practically outlined the modern study of degeneracy, his\r\ntheologic timidity forced an absolute definition of a state which,\r\naccording to his own admission, was purely relative. After fencing\r\nsomewhat with the position that there was a primevally perfect man,[9] he\r\nadmits with Tessier the primeval lowness of man, but also thinks that the\r\nfall of man could create new conditions which, in his descendants, from\r\nheredity and from causes acting on their health, tended to make them\r\ndepart from the primitive type. These departures from the primitive type\r\nhave led to varieties, some of which constitute races capable of\r\ntransmitting racial characteristics. Other varieties in the races\r\nthemselves have created the abnormal states which Morel has denominated\r\ndegeneracies. Each of these degeneracies has its own stamp from the cause\r\nthat produces it. Their common characteristic is hereditary transmission\r\nunder graver conditions than normal heredity. With certain exceptional\r\ninstances of regeneration, the progeny of degenerates presents progressive\r\ndegradation. This may reach such limits that humanity is preserved by its\r\nexcess. It is not necessary, however, that the ultimate stage of\r\ndegradation be reached before sterility occurs. Morel confines degeneracy\r\nto a pathologic type, criticising F. Heusinger[10] for applying the term\r\ndegenerate to domestic animals which \"throw back\" to the wild or original\r\ntype. Morel's admission that causes influencing health produce deviations\r\nwhich, under favouring conditions, become racial types capable of\r\nindefinite transmission, saves him from absolute scientific inaccuracy,\r\nbut renders inconsistent his limitation of degeneracy. It may be\r\nconvenient to separate diseased states from anomalies, but such separation\r\ncan only be very relative. From his conservatism and his plentiful data,\r\nMorel aroused much less antagonism than did a contemporary, Moreau (de\r\nTours), who bore to him the relation of Darwin to Wallace.[11] While\r\nMoreau devotes much attention to the factors of degeneracy and its\r\nstigmata (or marks), like Morel, his main point is the expansion of the\r\ntheory of Aristotle which Dryden epigrammatised into--\r\n\r\n  \"Great wit to madness nearly is allied,\r\n  And thin partitions do their bounds divide.\"\r\n\r\nAs J. G. Kiernan shows,[12] this doctrine, early in the history of the\r\nrace, obtained dominance through the evolution of arts, sciences, and\r\nreligions from fetichism. Phenomena manifested by fetich priests (of the\r\nShaman type) so closely resembled epileptic insanity in its frenzies and\r\nvisions that the two states were long regarded as identical, whence the\r\nterm \"_morbus sacer_.\" The supernatural influences which, in current\r\nbelief, underlay epilepsy were, at the outset, malign or benign as they\r\nwere offended or placated. They became benign, and the insane were under\r\nprotection of a deity, as in Mussulman countries. Later still the\r\ndemon-possession theory gained dominance, and at length the demon sank\r\ninto disease. Throughout all this evolution the belief in an inherent\r\naffinity between insanity and genius persisted.\r\n\r\nAristotle, in whose day the disease notion was becoming dominant, asserts\r\nthat, under the influence of head congestion, persons sometimes become\r\nprophets, sybils, and poets. Thus Mark, the Syracusan, was a pretty fair\r\npoet during a maniacal attack, but could not compose when sane. Men\r\nillustrious in poetry, arts, and statesmanship are often insane, like\r\nAjax, or misanthropic like Bellerophon. Even at a recent period similar\r\ndispositions are evident in Plato, Socrates, Empedocles, and many others,\r\nabove all, the poets.\r\n\r\nAccording to Plato, \"Delirium is by no means evil, but when it comes by\r\ngift of the gods, a very great benefit. In delirium the sibyls of Delphi\r\nand Dodona were of great service to Greece, but when in cold blood were of\r\nlittle or none. Frequently, when the gods afflicted men with epidemics, a\r\nsacred delirium inspired some men with a remedy for these. The Muses\r\nexcite some souls to delirium to glorify heroes with poetry, or to\r\ninstruct future generations.\"\r\n\r\nPrecedent to the works of Morel and Moreau appeared their source and\r\ninspiration, Prosper Lucas's _Natural Heredity_.[13] Here the biologic\r\ncurrent of thought encountered the sociologic current; although the waves\r\nclashed, the two currents merged into and modified each other. The\r\nbiologist demonstrated that degenerate types often \"threw back\" in their\r\nstructures, and this very \"throwing back\" made them the fittest to\r\nsurvive. The sociologist found that the only test of acquired or inherited\r\ndegeneracy in man was disaccord with environment. The co-existent moral\r\nand physical defects resultant on heredity found by Erasmus Darwin, Rush,\r\nParkman, Grohmann, and others tended to show that all types of defectives\r\nmight be a product of heredity.\r\n\r\nThese stimulating researches into the sources of crime led to a\r\ncontroversy which reached its height two decades ere the treatise of\r\nMorel. To this controversy three suggestive works owed their origin: a\r\npsychological treatise by Dr. Lauvergne[14] on felons, a romance with a\r\npurpose by Eugene Sue,[15] and a suggestively practical brochure by a\r\nrather corrupt police official, Vidocq.[16] Seemingly conflicting as were\r\nthese productions, all strikingly illustrated the influence of heredity\r\nand environment in the production of defectives. To these productions were\r\nsoon added those of Moreau (de Tours),[17] Attemyer, Eliza Farnham,[18]\r\nthe American Sampson,[19] Dally, Lelut, Camper, and the older Voisin.\r\n\r\nMorel[20] laid the foundation of what is widely known as the Lombroso\r\nSchool by a brochure wherein he proposed to entitle morbid anthropology,\r\n\"that part of the science of man the aim of which is to study phenomena\r\ndue to morbid influences and to malign heredity.\"\r\n\r\nTo the factor of atavism, inconsistently ignored by Morel, the early\r\nembryologic studies of Von Baer and the biologic studies resultant on the\r\ntransmutation of species lent special emphasis. Three possibilities of\r\nlife await, as Wilson[21] remarks, each living being: either it remains\r\nprimitive and unchanged, or it progresses toward a higher type, or it\r\nbackslides and retrogresses. The factors underlying the stable state force\r\nthe animal to remain as it is; those underlying the progressive tendency\r\nmake it more elaborate, while the factors of degeneration, on the other\r\nhand, tend to simplify its structure. It requires no special thought to\r\nperceive that progress is a great fact of nature. The development of every\r\nanimal and plant shows the possibilities of nature in this direction. But\r\nthe bearings of physiological backsliding are not so clearly seen.\r\n\r\nThat certain animals degenerate or retrogress in their development is\r\nsusceptible of ready and familiar illustration. No better illustration is\r\nneeded than is derived from the domain of parasitic existence. When an\r\nanimal or plant attaches itself partly or wholly to another living being,\r\nand becomes more or less dependent upon the latter for support and\r\nnourishment, it exhibits, as a rule, retrogression and degeneration. The\r\nparasitic \"guest\" dependent on its \"host\" for lodging alone, or it may be\r\nfor both board and lodging, is in a fair way to become degraded in\r\nstructure, and, as a rule, exhibits marked degradation where the\r\nassociation has persisted sufficiently long. Parasitism and servile\r\ndependence act very much in structural lower life as analogous instances\r\nof mental dependence on others act on man.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of characteristic individuality and the extinction of\r\npersonality are natural results of that form of association wherein one\r\nform becomes absolutely dependent on another for all the conditions of\r\nlife. A life of mere attachment exhibits similar results, and organs of\r\nmovement disappear by the law of disuse. A digestive system is a\r\nsuperfluity to an animal which, like the tapeworm, obtains its food ready\r\nmade in the very kitchen, so to speak, of its host. Hence the lack of\r\ndigestive apparatus follows the finding of a free commissariat by the\r\nparasite. Organs of sense are not necessary for an attached and rooted\r\nanimal; these latter, therefore, go by the board and the nervous system\r\nitself becomes modified and altered. Degradation wholesale and complete is\r\nthe penalty the parasite has to pay for its free board and lodging; and in\r\nthis fashion Nature may be said to revenge the host for the pains and\r\ntroubles wherewith, like Job of old, he may be tormented.\r\n\r\nThe most emphatic biologic degeneration is that discovered by\r\nKowalevsky[22] in the sea squirt, which, in its larval state, is a\r\nvertebrate, and when adult is an ascidian, seemingly far below the\r\ncuttlefish and the worms. This strikingly illustrates that, as Ray\r\nLankester[23] has said, degeneration is a gradual change of structure by\r\nwhich the organism becomes adapted to less varied and less complex\r\nconditions of life; a reverse of evolution which proceeds from the\r\nindefinite and homogeneous to the definite and heterogeneous with a loss\r\nof explosive force due to the acquirement of inhibitions or checks.\r\n\r\nThis principle of biologic degeneration, long recognised, was most lucidly\r\nenforced by Dohrn[24], whose views were later extended by Ray Lankester.\r\nThe parallelism of animal degeneracy with that of man, so clearly evident\r\neven in the parasitic nature of defectives, was, as Meynert[25] showed,\r\ndue to the fact that the fore-brain is an inhibitory apparatus against the\r\nlower and more instinctive natural impulses. The higher its development\r\nthe greater is the tendency to subordinate the particular to the general.\r\nEven in insects a high social growth occurs, as in the bee and ant\r\ncommunities. The same is the case in the development of man; in the\r\ninfant, a being entirely wrapped in its instincts of self-preservation,\r\nthe \"primary ego\" is predominant and the child is an egotistic parasite.\r\nAs development goes on this standpoint is passed, conscience assumes its\r\npriority, the fore-brain acts as a check on the purely vegetative\r\nfunctions and the \"secondary ego\" takes precedence over the primary one;\r\nthis is the general order of society, designated as civilisation or social\r\norder. If this inhibition become weakened or disordered, predominance of\r\nthe natural instincts or impulses occurs, and when it is totally lost the\r\nindividual is in the position of a criminal who opposes the ethical order\r\nof society--a parasite, and one of the worst kind who not only lives upon\r\nhis host but destroys him in doing so.\r\n\r\nHence degenerate tendencies are reversions in type indicating the original\r\nsource of the inhibition.\r\n\r\nThe tree of Moreau[26] illustrates clearly the essential principles of\r\nthese inter-relations of defect, further elucidated by the observations of\r\nSander[27] on the connection of deformed central nervous systems with\r\nmental and moral disorder.\r\n\r\n  _NERVOUS HEREDITY._\r\n\r\n                                 { Science           { Music.\r\n  Exceptional Intelligence       { Arts              { Painting.\r\n                                 { Letters\r\n\r\n                                 {                   { Paretic dementia.\r\n                                 {                   { Paralyses.\r\n                                 { Brain             { Tumours.\r\n  Lesions of the Nerve Centres   {                   { Brain Softening.\r\n                                 {                   { Congestion.\r\n                                 {\r\n                                 {                   { Softening of Spinal\r\n                                 { Spinal Cord       {   Cord.\r\n                                 {                   { Myelitis.\r\n\r\n                                 { Epilepsy.\r\n                                 { Chorea.\r\n  Neuroses                       { Stammering.\r\n                                 { Convulsive Fits.\r\n                                 { Hysteria.\r\n\r\n                                 { Utopians.\r\n  Intellectual States            { Eccentrics.\r\n                                 { Mixed Conditions.\r\n\r\n                                 { Prostitutes.\r\n  Emotional States               { Criminals.\r\n                                 { Unstable.\r\n\r\n  Neuralgia                      { External.\r\n                                 { Internal.\r\n\r\n                                 {                   { Symptomatical.\r\n                                 { Acute Insanity    { Idiopathic.\r\n                                 {                   { Alcoholic.\r\n  Psychoses                      { Imbecility\r\n                                 { Idiocy            { General Insanity.\r\n                                 { Chronic Insanity  { Dementia.\r\n                                                     { Partial Insanity.\r\n\r\n                                                     { Congenital\r\n                                                     {   Blindness.\r\n  Special and General Conditions of the Senses       { Anaesthesiae.\r\n                                                     { Deafness.\r\n                                                     { Hyperaesthesiae.\r\n\r\n  Nutritional Defect.\r\n\r\nThe extensive studies of Niepce,[28] Vogt,[29] and others on idiot biology\r\nsought to show that the brain was not merely arrested in development, but\r\nsometimes reverted even as low as the sauropsida type (reptiles and\r\nbirds). Grohmann,[30] as early as 1820, had \"often been impressed in\r\ncriminals, especially in those of defective development, by the prominent\r\nears, the shape of the cranium, the projecting cheek-bones, the large\r\nlower jaws, the deeply placed eyes, the shifty, animal-like gaze.\"\r\n\r\nMaudsley[31] observes that in the case of such an extreme morbid variety\r\nas a congenital idiot we have to do with a defective nervous organisation.\r\nMarchand, in the brain of two idiots of European descent, found the\r\nconvolutions fewer in number, individually less complex, broader and\r\nsmoother than in the apes. The condition results neither from atrophy nor\r\nmere arrest of growth, but consists essentially in an imperfect evolution\r\nof the cerebral hemispheres or their parts, dependent on an arrest of\r\ndevelopment. The proportion of the weight of brain to that of body is\r\nextraordinarily diminished. With the brain of the orang type comes a\r\ncorresponding defect of function. With this animal type of brain in idiocy\r\nsometimes appear animal traits and instincts. One class of idiots is\r\njustly designated theroid, so brute-like are its members.\r\n\r\nThe human brain in the course of foetal development passes through the\r\nsame stages as other vertebrate brains, and to some extent these\r\ntransitional stages resemble the permanent forms of their brain. Summing\r\nup, as it were, in itself the leading forms of vertebrate type, there is\r\ntruly a brute brain within the man's, and when the latter stops short of\r\nits characteristic development, it is natural that it should manifest only\r\nits most primitive functions.\r\n\r\nIt must, however, be pointed out that the human brain, even of the idiot\r\nor microcephales, never resembles, _as a whole_, the brain of any\r\nanthropoid or lower animal form. Such a position was maintained by Vogt,\r\nbut has long since been abandoned. The existing anthropoid apes are not\r\nthe ancestors of man, and have pursued a different development.[32]\r\n\r\nDespine's[33] researches revealed the absence of human checks on the\r\ninstinctive tendencies in criminals. He, however, started from the\r\ndoctrine of moral imbecility as elaborated by Rush, Prichard, Brigham,\r\nRay, Galt, and others. Bruce Thomson,[34] testing Despine's results by\r\nprimitive races and Scotch criminals, found that defective, abnormal, and\r\nanomalous states of the instinctive faculties exist in entire races and in\r\nthe \"moral idiots\" that occur in the best races. Criminals form a variety\r\nof the human family quite distinct from law-abiding men. A low type of\r\nphysique indicating a deteriorated character gives a family likeness due\r\nto the fact that they form a community which retrogrades from generation\r\nto generation. The low physical condition of juvenile criminals in\r\nreformatories, &c., becomes at once obvious if they be compared with\r\nhealthy, active school children. They are puny, sickly, scrofulous, often\r\ndeformed, with peculiar, unnaturally developed heads, sluggish, stupid,\r\nliable to fits, mean in figure, and defective in vital energy, while at\r\nthe same time they are irritable, violent, and too often quite\r\nincorrigible. The adults usually have a singularly stupid and insensate\r\nlook. The complexion is bad. The outlines of the head are harsh and\r\nangular. The boys are ugly in feature, and have, as a rule, repulsive\r\nappearances. These diseases of criminals are a proof of their low type and\r\ndeteriorated condition. Their deaths are mainly due to tubercular diseases\r\nand affections of the nervous system. In the greater number crime is\r\nhereditary, a tendency which is, in most cases, associated with bodily\r\ndefect, such as spinal deformities, stammering or other imperfect speech,\r\nclub-foot, cleft-palate, hare-lip, deformed jaws and teeth, deaf-mutism,\r\ncongenital blindness, paralysis, epilepsy, and scrofula.\r\n\r\nElisha Harris,[35] of New York, among 233 convicts found 54 to belong to\r\nfamilies in which insanity, epilepsy, and other neuroses existed.\r\nEighty-three per cent. belonged to a criminal, pauper, or inebriate stock,\r\nand were, therefore, hereditarily or congenitally affected. Nearly 76 per\r\ncent. of their number hence proved habitual criminals. According to\r\nHarris, crime, pauperism, and insanity revert into each other, so that\r\ninsanity in the parent produces crime or pauperism in the offspring, or,\r\n_vice versa_, crime or pauperism in the parent produces disease or\r\ninsanity in the offspring. Campagne, Broca, G. Wilson, and others about\r\nthe same time made similar researches.\r\n\r\nThe American sociologist, Samuel Royce, after a careful study of American\r\nand European defective classes,[36] found that observation of the\r\nhereditary nature of pauperism which congenitally reverts into insanity,\r\ndisease or crime, leaves no doubt but that pauperism is one of the worst\r\nforms of race deterioration, and that the paralysis of the human will and\r\nits energies is but the result of a fearful dissolution in progress.\r\n\r\nExtensive researches made by Charles S. Hoyt,[37] of the New York State\r\nBoard of Charities (1874), into the origin of the defective classes of\r\nthat state, show that the pauper, hysteric, epileptic, prostitute,\r\ncriminal, born-blind, deaf-mute, paranoiac, recurrent lunatic and idiot\r\nwere buds of the same tree of degenerate heredity. E. C. Spitzka,[38]\r\nbasing his researches on the principles of Morel as expanded and\r\ncritically applied by Meynert,[39] reached essentially the same results as\r\nalso did Westphal, Krafft-Ebing, Grille, Kerlin, Axel Key, Magnan,\r\nFoville, Bjornstrom, Amadei, Schuele, Nicolson,[40] Tonnini, Tamburini,\r\nVerga, Tamassia, Kowalevsky, and it may be said the German Psychiatrical\r\nSociety (which, by accepting a conception of the distortion of mental\r\nfaculties otherwise seemingly high, based on brain deformity rather than\r\ndisease, accepted the degeneracy doctrine of to-day).\r\n\r\nFor several decades, moreover, the stigmata of degeneracy have appeared in\r\nFrench, German, Austrian, Russian, Italian, and Scandinavian court reports\r\nas evidence of hereditary defects.\r\n\r\nAs often happens in science--\r\n\r\n  \"Thought by thought is piled till some great truth\r\n  Is loosened and the nations echo round.\"\r\n\r\nWherefore about this period (1870-78) appeared the first volume of the\r\nepoch-making work of Cesare Lombroso,[41] who, erroneously credited with\r\nbeing the apostle of the modern doctrine of degeneracy, has admittedly\r\ndone more to stimulate research than any other investigator. This work\r\nexerted an influence at first in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Russia,\r\nand the Scandinavian countries, while on the English-speaking countries,\r\ndespite the apparently fertile soil prepared for it, its influence was\r\nseemingly slight. Under the degradation produced in many American\r\ncharitable and correctional institutions by corruption, naturally\r\nresultant on a civil war, science therein was at a decided discount\r\nbetween 1861 and 1881. A school arose which, defying the individualistic\r\nrule of English common law underlying the institutions of the United\r\nStates, pandered to mob-law and theologic prejudice by denying certain\r\nwell-ascertained facts in human degeneracy. This school, represented at\r\nthe Guiteau trial by the experts for the prosecution, denied heredity and\r\nthat moral defect could result from physical abnormality. This school,\r\nhowever, was by no means representative of American psychiatry or\r\nsociology. Rush, Brigham, James MacDonald, Gait, McFarland, W. W. Godding,\r\nRay, C. H. Hughes, Kerlin, Patterson, Wilbur, Fisher, J. H. McBride, C. H.\r\nNichols, C. A. Folsom, Cowles, and others accepted Morel's principles.\r\nSpitzka,[42] long ere the trial, pointed out that criminals displayed the\r\nstigmata of Morel, and that the more intellectual types of insanity were\r\nbased on brain deformity rather than disease.\r\n\r\nBenedikt,[43] of Vienna, in 1879 stated that \"criminals generally have\r\nnothing analogous to monomaniacs. They tend to develop distinct\r\npeculiarities of organisation and psychic features, and these\r\npeculiarities are the product of their social condition.\" J. G.\r\nKiernan,[44] reviewing his work, remarked that any one who had at all\r\nexamined the question would be convinced that between the true criminal\r\ntype, the imbecile and the paranoiac (_primaere verrueckt_) the\r\npsychological relations and their anatomical bases are intimate and close.\r\nHad Benedikt examined the insane and criminals, not for convolutional\r\naberrations alone, but also for heterotopias, &c., he would never have\r\nwritten the sentence just quoted.\r\n\r\nW. W. Godding,[45] commenting on the evidence of J. P. Gray,[46] the\r\nleader of the American school that denies degeneracy, feelingly remarked\r\nthat \"the disordered mind does not cease to be a unit although the\r\nobserved manifestations of its insanity may seem to be confined in some\r\ncases to the emotion; in others to the affection; and in still others to\r\nthe intellectual powers. We cannot deny that the old masters were as\r\nkeen-sighted observers as ourselves. I dislike to hear drunkenness called\r\ndipsomania, as I so often do; but I do not therefore say that dipsomania\r\nis only drunkenness. It might improve my standing with the legal\r\nfraternity if I should pronounce kleptomania only another name for\r\nstealing, but my personal observations convince me that the insane have\r\nsometimes a disposition to steal, which is a direct result of their\r\ndisease, and for which they are no more accountable than the puerperal\r\nmaniac is for her oaths.\r\n\r\n\"And now, after all these years of careful research, and our asylum\r\nreports[47] rendered bulky with long tables prepared with so much care,\r\ninvolving inquiry on the origin of the disease not alone in the direct\r\nfamily line, but in the collateral branches also; just when the medical\r\nprofession has come to believe that if one fact in medical science be\r\nbetter established than another, it is that insanity is hereditary, and we\r\nundertake in the present case to look up hereditary predisposition, and\r\nthe family disposition likewise, we are met with the withering conundrum,\r\n'Can a man inherit insanity from his uncle?' and we are told that there is\r\nno such thing as hereditary insanity. Yes, gentlemen, I understand you;\r\nthe tendency to the disease is inherited. And so in the strict use of\r\nlanguage there is no such thing as insane delusion; but we know that\r\nlanguage is seldom used with scientific exactness, and no one is at a loss\r\nto understand what we mean when we say that Jones is full of insane\r\ndelusions, insanity being hereditary in his family. Yes, and if Jones\r\nshould marry an insane woman, the chances are good that Jones's son will\r\nturn out crazy, no matter how carefully he may be brought up under the\r\ndirection of the most eminent psychist, for that little germ which you\r\ncall 'a tendency'--so minute that it will elude your most careful scrutiny\r\nwith scalpel and microscope--is a fixed fact, and will prove more potent\r\nthan all theories. Not born there; develops. Ah, how is it that science\r\nshows us that syphilis and small-pox and tubercle are born in the\r\noffspring, that the infant comes into the world with spina bifida,\r\nidiotic, hydrocephalic, acephalic, that the child is blind and mute and\r\nmisshapen in his mother's womb, but is never insane? Because, forsooth, we\r\nhave seen fit to limit insanity to disease of the brain, and disease is\r\nnot inherited. Is it possible that in all these years it has not been Dr.\r\nGray's lot as it has been mine to be consulted about those 'queer'\r\nchildren of insane parentage, who are perverse from the start? Will he say\r\nthat the perverseness is only a 'badness' which should be whipped out of\r\nthe child? But that has generally been thoroughly tried before the\r\nphysician is consulted. Heterodox I know it is, but observed facts compel\r\nme to be heterodox with Prichard and Esquirol and Ray, with Morel and\r\nGriesinger and Maudsley, and I know not how many others, in recognising in\r\nsome cases a condition of inherent defect born in the individual, and not\r\na result of education--a condition which writers have recognised under\r\nvarious names as hereditary mental disorder, insane diathesis, insane\r\ntemperament.\"\r\n\r\nThe Guiteau trial so stimulated studies of degeneracy that two experts for\r\nthe prosecution, A. McL. Hamilton[48] and H. M. Stearns,[49] later changed\r\ntheir views as to degeneracy, while C. L. Dana, a strong supporter of the\r\nGray school in 1881, subsequently made valuable contributions to the\r\nliterature of the degeneracy stigmata. The position then taken by Spitzka\r\nand Kiernan as to the cerebral basis of degeneracy was in 1882 supported\r\nby H. Howard,[50] of Montreal; Workman,[51] of Toronto; Kerlin,[52] of\r\nPennsylvania; Osler,[53] of Baltimore; and C. K. Mills,[54] of\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\nIt was during 1881, moreover, that Jacobi made extensive studies of\r\ndegeneracy in royalty and aristocracy,[55] as earlier had Ireland.[56]\r\n\r\nFrom the time of Itard degenerate phenomena in idiots had been traced to\r\ncerebral mal-development. Kerlin[57] pointed out that \"epileptic change\"\r\nin them was marked by moral alteration similar in explosive characters to\r\nthat so frequently observed in criminals. In England students of idiocy\r\nlike Clouston, Shuttleworth, Beach, Ireland, Langdon Down, and others, had\r\nearly brought the recognition of its inter-relations with insanity, crime\r\nand neuroses into strong relief. To the studies of Bruce Thomson,\r\nMaudsley, and Nicolson, Tyndall[58] gave strong support from the actual\r\nexperience of a governor of a great British prison, who found that the\r\nprisoners in his charge might be divided into three distinct classes: the\r\nfirst class consisted of persons who ought never to have been in prison;\r\nexternal accident and not internal taint had brought them within the grasp\r\nof the law, and what had happened to them might happen to most of us; they\r\nwere essentially men of sound moral stamina, though wearing the prison\r\ngarb. Then came the largest class, formed of individuals possessing no\r\nstrong bias, moral or immoral, plastic to the touch of circumstances which\r\nwould mould them into either good or evil members of society. Thirdly,\r\ncame a class, happily not a large one, whom no kindness could conciliate\r\nand no discipline tame. They were sent into the world labelled\r\n\"incorrigible,\" wickedness being stamped, as it were, upon their\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\nWith the close of the year 1883 the degeneracy doctrine may be regarded as\r\nhaving practically been accepted in biology, in anthropology, in\r\nsociology, in criminology, in psychiatry, and general pathology. Debate\r\nwas henceforth not as to its existence, but as to its limitations.\r\nPrecedent to 1835 determinism in popular thought due to Calvinistic\r\npredestination had, in English-speaking countries, fought for the\r\ndoctrine; subsequent thereto the theologic reaction against Calvinism was\r\na strong opposing force, whose influence was finally destroyed by the\r\npractically general acceptance of the doctrine of evolution in the late\r\nseventies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE STIGMATA OF DEGENERACY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attempt made by Morel to limit the doctrine of degeneracy to the\r\ndomain of the morbid proved impossible, because of the rapid accumulation\r\nof data by his own school, which demonstrated that atavistic deformity\r\nplayed a larger part in the production of diseases. Bland Sutton does not\r\ntoo forcibly put this result when he states[59] that if it be difficult to\r\ndefine disease when restricted to the human family, it becomes obviously\r\nmore difficult when disease is investigated on a broad biological basis.\r\nAs the great barrier which exists between man and those members of his\r\nclass most closely allied to him consists not in structural characters but\r\nin mental power, it necessarily follows that there should be a similarity\r\nin the structural alterations induced by diseased conditions in all kinds\r\nof animals, allowing of course for the difference in environment. This is\r\nknown to be the case, and it is clear that as there has been a gradual\r\nevolution of complex from simple organisms, it necessarily follows that\r\nthe principles of evolution ought to apply to diseased conditions if they\r\nhold good for the normal or healthy states or organism; in plain words,\r\nthere has been an evolution of disease _pari passu_ with evolution of\r\nanimal forms. For a long time it has been customary to talk of physiologic\r\ntypes of diseased tissues; Sutton's earlier efforts were directed to\r\nsearching among animals for the purpose of detecting in them the\r\noccurrence of tissues, which in man are only found under abnormal\r\nconditions. The statement proved to be true in a limited sense. At the\r\nsame time the truth of an opinion held by nearly all thoughtful\r\nphysicians, that disease may in many instances be regarded as an\r\nexaggerated function, was forcibly illustrated; the manifestations of\r\ndisease were found to be regulated by the same law which governs\r\nphysiological processes in general, and many conditions regarded as\r\npathological in one animal were revealed as physiological in another.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine, therefore, has its scope limited only by biologic data. It\r\nof necessity begins with the cell itself in its relation to other cells of\r\nthat practically compound organism which constitutes a single vertebrate.\r\nThe cell may, therefore, degenerate as a single member of that organism,\r\nproducing danger or benefit to the other cells. Thus the cancer cell\r\ndegenerates in its power of reproduction below the tissue to which it\r\nbelongs. It is peculiarly true here, as has been said by Herbert Spencer,\r\nthat every vertebrate is an aggregate whose internal actions are adapted\r\nto counterbalance its external actions; hence the preservation of its\r\nmovable equilibrium depends upon its development and the proper number of\r\nthese actions; the movable equilibrium may be ruined when one of these\r\nactions is too great or too small, and through deficiency or need of some\r\norganic or inorganic cause in its surroundings. Every individual can\r\nadapt itself to these changeable influences in two ways, either directly\r\nor by producing new individuals who will take the place of those whom the\r\nequilibrium has destroyed. Therefore there exist forces preservative and\r\ndestructive of the race. As it is impossible that these two kinds of force\r\nshould counterbalance each other, it is necessary that the equilibrium\r\nshould re-establish itself in an orderly way. Since there are two\r\npreservative forces of every animal group--the impulse of every individual\r\nto self-preservation and the impulse to the production of other\r\nindividuals--these faculties must vary in an inverse ratio; the former\r\nmust diminish when the second augments. Degeneration constitutes a process\r\nof disintegration, the reverse of integration. Hence, if the term\r\nindividuation be applied to all the processes which complete and sustain\r\nthe life of the individual, and that of generation to those which aid the\r\nformation and development of new individuals, individuation and generation\r\nare necessarily antagonistic.\r\n\r\nIn the phenomena of unisexual generation we see that the larger organisms\r\nnever reproduce themselves in the unisexual way, while the smaller\r\norganisms reproduce themselves with the greatest rapidity by this method.\r\nBetween these two extremes unisexual reproduction decreases while the size\r\nincreases. In the history of all plants and animals is evident the\r\nphysiologic truth, that while the general growth of the individual\r\nproceeds rapidly, the reproductive organs remain imperfectly developed and\r\ninactive. On the contrary, the principle of reproduction indicates\r\ndecrease in the intensity of growth and becomes a cause of cessation.\r\n\r\nGreat fecundity is always attended by great mortality. Each superior\r\ndegree of organic evolution is accompanied by an inferior degree of\r\nfecundity. The greater the germs the less is the individuation, and _vice\r\nversa_. The greater and more complex the organisation, the less is the\r\npower of multiplication.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the cells is also true of organs composed of them. Each\r\norgan can be regarded as a distinct animal (a parasite is preferable for\r\ncomparison) which has its own nervous system (the ganglia), but is fed and\r\ncontrolled by the organism as a whole. Degeneration of this organ may\r\ntherefore be an expression of a local state peculiar to it and either\r\nbeneficial or maleficent, or both in inverse degree, to the organism as a\r\nwhole, or it may be the expression of a general defect in the whole\r\norganism. The sclerotic states of the appendix vermiformis in man and of\r\nthe human liver are, as Kiernan has shown, two excellent illustrations of\r\nthe degeneracies last described. Man, in common with the four anthropoid\r\napes, has a little thin tube attached to the caecum known as the appendix\r\nvermiformis. In the early embryo it is equal in calibre to the other\r\nbowels, but ceases to grow proportionately after a certain time. In the\r\nnew-born child it is almost as large as in the adult. As this tube proved\r\ndisadvantageous to man's precursor (as it does to certain mammals) from\r\ncatching foreign bodies which form the nucleus of enteroliths or bowel\r\nstones, it has lost the nutritive supply of the other intestines and is\r\ntending to disappear. It is often absent in man. The defect in its\r\nstructure, while predisposing to the attacks of germs and an expression of\r\nits own degeneracy, is an evidence of an advance in evolution in the\r\norganism as a whole by which great danger and waste of nutritive force\r\nare avoided.\r\n\r\nRecent researches[60] have shown that \"hob-nail\" liver, once supposed to\r\nbe due entirely to abuse of alcohol, usually occurs in states of\r\ncongenital deficiency in persons of defective heredity. The change in the\r\nappendix which is tending to cause its disappearance is essentially a\r\nsclerosis, and hence is morbid, considered from the appendix standpoint\r\nalone. As the same process occurs in \"hob-nail\" liver, it is obvious that\r\ndegeneracy may be an expression of general advance and local defect or may\r\nbe a local expression of general defect. The same phenomenon is seen in\r\nthe nervous system. The researches of Cunningham[61] have shown that in\r\nman the struggle for existence between the sympathetic and the\r\ncerebro-spinal system has ended in the victory of the latter, while the\r\nfirst is tending to disappear. Such changes must necessarily result in\r\nlocal degeneracies which are for the benefit of the organism as a whole.\r\nDegeneracy on this basis may express itself in simple disturbance of the\r\nlower or nutritive functions. The uric acid or gouty states, for example,\r\nare, as Fothergill long ago pointed out, assumptions by mammalian organs\r\nof the functions of those of birds and reptiles. In conditions like\r\nmyxoedema the skin, through thyroid gland disturbances, takes on features\r\nwhich resemble in result those found in certain mollusks and low fish.\r\nThese nutritive disturbances may show themselves in disorders of the\r\npituitary body (acromegaly, giantism, &c.), whereby the bony system of man\r\nreverts to conditions like those of the gorilla. The same conditions also\r\nappear in the diathesis of the \"bleeders.\" All these conditions, however,\r\nmay be an expression of a degenerate type assuming a normal equilibrium,\r\nas well as of a normal organism taking the first steps in degeneracy.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, therefore, as Dohrn has pointed out, this principle\r\nholds good of man not only as an organic unit but as a compound organism.\r\nDegeneracy[62] is a gradual change of structures by which the organism\r\nbecomes adapted to less varied and less complex conditions of life. The\r\nopposite progression process of elaboration is a gradual change of\r\nstructure in which the organism becomes adapted to more and more varied\r\nand complex conditions of existence. In elaboration there is a new\r\nexpression of form corresponding to new perfection of work in the animal\r\nmachine. In degeneracy there is suppression of form corresponding to the\r\ncessation of work. Elaboration of some one organ may be a necessary\r\naccompaniment of degeneracy in all the others. This is very generally the\r\ncase. Only when the total result of the elaboration of some organs, and\r\nthe degeneracy of others, is such as to leave the whole mass in a lower\r\ncondition--that is, fitted to less complex action and reaction in regard\r\nto its surroundings than is the type--can the individual be regarded as an\r\ninstance of degeneracy. These degeneracies appear at varying periods,\r\nsince struggles for existence on the part of the different organs and\r\nsystems of the body are most ardent during periods of body evolution and\r\ninvolution. During foetal life, during the first dentition, during the\r\nsecond dentition (often as late as the thirteenth year), during puberty\r\nand adolescence (fourteen to twenty-five), during the climacteric (forty\r\nto sixty), when uterine involution occurs in woman and prostatic\r\ninvolution in man, and finally during senility (sixty and upwards), during\r\nall these periods degeneracy may be shown by mental or physical defect, a\r\ncongenital tendency to which has remained latent until the period of\r\nstress. These defects may be such biochemic alterations (undemonstrable by\r\nexisting methods) as lead to diminished inhibitory power or other altered\r\nfunction, or to secondary pathologic or teratologic change of decidedly\r\ndemonstrable nature. Organs and structures checked at a certain phase of\r\ndevelopment may pursue a course of development differing from that pointed\r\nout in man but outlined in other vertebrates. The human cyclopean\r\nmonstrosities, for example, might be regarded as reversions to the\r\nsingle-eyed sea-squirts, who are possibly the Ascidian precursors of the\r\nvertebrates.\r\n\r\nThe scope of degeneracy may therefore be limited to certain signs which\r\nare its sole expressions. These signs (stigmata as they were early called)\r\nmay be the only expression of degeneracy, and their significance must be\r\ndetermined by a careful examination of the organism in which these\r\nexpressions are found, since they may be merely defects produced by\r\ndegeneracy, or may indicate how deep such degeneracy has penetrated. They\r\nmay, therefore, indicate either slight or serious defect. In proportion to\r\nthe depth of degeneracy in the organism will the stigmata affect the\r\nearlier simpler or later complicated acquisitions through evolution. Of\r\nnecessity, when the organism is affected by degeneracy, the morbid element\r\nwill take the line of least resistance, determined by the depth of\r\ndegeneracy as well as the variability of the structures concerned. The\r\nsame influence must equally affect functions of the structures.\r\nFurthermore, expressions of degeneracy will, as already stated, be\r\ninfluenced by the periods of stress; the first and second dentition,\r\npuberty, the climacteric and the senile period. In a general way these\r\nstigmata are divisible into mental and physical, and are best observable\r\nin their relations to the periods of stress. In certain races, as in\r\ncertain animals, conditions appearing before puberty was completed cannot\r\nbe considered as settling the position of the animal in evolution. What is\r\ntrue of individuals is also true of classes. The anthropoid apes and the\r\nnegroes are much higher in physical characteristics, with potential mental\r\nresults, before puberty than after. The infant ape, as Havelock Ellis[63]\r\npoints out, is very much nearer to man than the adult ape. \"The infant ape\r\nis higher in the line of evolution than the adult, and the female ape, by\r\napproximating to the infant type, is somewhat higher than the male. Man,\r\nin carrying on the line of evolution, started not from some adult male\r\nsimian, but from the infant ape and, in a less degree, from the female\r\nape. The human infant bears precisely the same relation to his species as\r\nthe simian infant bears to his, and we are bound to conclude that his\r\nrelation to the future evolution of the race is similar. The human infant\r\npresents, in an exaggerated form, the chief distinctive characteristics of\r\nhumanity--the large head and brain, the small face, the hairlessness, the\r\ndelicate bony system. By some strange confusion of thought we usually\r\nignore this fact, and assume that the adult form is more highly developed\r\nthan the infantile form. From the point of view of adaptation to the\r\nenvironment, it is undoubtedly true that the coarse, hairy, large-boned\r\nand small-brained gorilla is better fitted to make his way in the world\r\nthan his delicate offspring; but from a zoological point of view we\r\nwitness anything but progress. In man, from about the third year onwards,\r\nfurther growth--though an absolutely necessary adaptation to the\r\nenvironment--is to some extent growth in degeneration and senility. It is\r\nnot carried to so low a degree as in the apes, although by it man is to\r\nsome extent brought nearer to the apes, and among the higher human races\r\nthe progress towards senility is less marked than among the lower human\r\nraces. The child of many African races is scarcely, if at all, less\r\nintelligent than the European child, but while the African as he grows up\r\nbecomes stupid and obtuse, and his whole social life falls into a state of\r\nhide-bound routine, the European retains much of his childlike vivacity.\r\nAnd if we turn to what we are accustomed to regard as the highest human\r\ntypes, as represented in men of genius, we shall find a striking\r\napproximation to the child type.\" The face, in its contest for existence\r\nwith the brain, has finally caused both the cranium and the jaws to assume\r\n(for defence and food purposes) a lower type, although as regards existing\r\nfunctions and the higher standpoint of environment the infantile type must\r\nbe considered the higher. Still a casual glance at the Ascidian tadpole\r\nshows that deficient as is the development of the ganglia afterward\r\nforming the medulla, the face is still more deficient. The face, as Minot\r\nshows,[64] is a characteristic of the higher vertebrates, and acquires\r\nincreased importance with rise in the evolution. The position of the face\r\nin embryonic development is originally determined by the head-bend. If a\r\nmedian, longitudinal section of the head be imagined to occupy a\r\nrectangular area divided into quarters, then the lower posterior quarter\r\ncorresponds to the mouth region, the other three-quarters to the brain. As\r\ndevelopment progresses, the mouth quarter so disproportionately enlarges\r\nin relation to the rest of the head as to project forward in front of the\r\nfore-brain. In this stage, which is represented by the adult amphibians,\r\nthe bulk of the facial apparatus is very great, proportionately to the\r\ncranium. In the reptiles the mouth region is elongated still further in\r\nfront of the brain-case, resulting in the long snout. In mammals a third\r\nstage is established by the great increase in size of the brain,\r\nespecially of the cerebral hemispheres. In consequence the brain comes to\r\nextend over the snout, as it were; in man, whose brain has the maximum\r\nenlargement, the facial apparatus is almost entirely covered by the brain.\r\nIn the course of evolution the face, while serviceable to the animal for\r\ncertain reasons of general constitutional character (food-getting, means\r\nof defence and means of obtaining mates), is less so than brain growth. A\r\nstruggle for existence, therefore, inevitably results between the tendency\r\nof the face to appropriate power of growth and the like tendency of the\r\nbrain, which, in defective organisms, produces marked reversions of the\r\none for the benefit of the other. This struggle is further complicated by\r\nthe embryonic relations to both of the hypophysis, since this body\r\nadmittedly exerts an influence over bone growth, most markedly (but\r\nabnormally) exhibited in acromegaly (excessive bone growth). In this\r\ncontest for existence in the degenerate types, degeneracy will, of\r\nnecessity, take the direction of least resistance. As the brain is the\r\nlast acquirement in vertebrates, considered from the standpoint of\r\nnecessity, while the face (also a late acquirement) is much less complex,\r\nthe last, obviously, will present the derangements from degeneration in\r\nshape, while the former will show these in shape and function.\r\nFurthermore, during the embryonic period the development of the brain\r\nwill, of necessity, be more immediately affected by degeneracy than the\r\nface, which will gain in evolution at its expense. The stigmata of\r\ndegeneracy, therefore, most likely to attract attention are in the order\r\ngiven, those of the face, jaws, and teeth; ear, eye, cranium; body, bodily\r\nfunctions; brain and spinal cord. Under these last are to be included\r\ntheir mental and nervous functions.\r\n\r\nThe following table summarizes in practical form these stigmata[65]:--\r\n\r\n               {              { Crime.\r\n               { Ethical      { Prostitution and Sexual Degeneracy.\r\n               { Degeneracy.  { Moral Insanity, Pauperism, and Inebriety.\r\n               {\r\n               {              { Paranoia.\r\n               {              { Adolescent Insanity.\r\n               {              { Periodical Insanity.\r\n  Cerebral.    { Intellectual { Hysteria.\r\n               { Degeneracy.  { Epilepsy.\r\n               {              { Neuroses.\r\n               {              { One-sided Genius.\r\n               {              { Idiocy.\r\n               {\r\n               { Sensory      { Deaf-Mutism.\r\n               { Degeneracy.  { Congenital Colour Blindness.\r\n               {              { Smell Abnormalities.\r\n\r\n  Spinal       Various congenital and hereditary disorders\r\n\r\n               { Exophthalmic Goitre.\r\n               { Lymphoid Degeneracy.\r\n               { Acromegaly.\r\n               { Tissue Instability.\r\n               { Adenoids.\r\n               { Myxoedema.\r\n  Nutritive    { Plural Births.\r\n  Degeneracy   { Bleeders.\r\n               { Cancer.\r\n               { Excessive Fecundity.\r\n               { Gout.\r\n               { Early Lipomatosis.\r\n\r\n               { Jaws.\r\n               { Cleft Palate.\r\n               { Teeth.\r\n               { Primitive Uteri.\r\n  Local        { Cloacal conditions (and allied male states)\r\n  Reversionary { Horseshoe Kidney and allied states.\r\n  Tendencies.  { Cyclopian Monstrosities.\r\n               { Amelia and Polymelia, Club feet, &c.\r\n               { Plural mammae.\r\n               { Simian muscular and bony states.\r\n               { Liver and other organ reversions.\r\n\r\nThe factors producing degeneration act by causing nervous exhaustion in\r\nthe first generation. This implies a practical degeneration in function\r\nsince tone is lost.\r\n\r\nEvery nerve cell has two functions, one connected with sensation or\r\nmotion, and the other with growth. If the cell be tired by excessive work\r\nalong the line of sensation or motion the function as regards growth\r\nbecomes later impaired, and it not only ceases to continue in strength,\r\nbut becomes self-poisoned. Each of the organs (heart, liver, kidneys, &c.)\r\nhas its own system of nerves (the sympathetic ganglia), which while under\r\ncontrol by the spinal cord and brain act independently. If these nerves\r\nbecome tired the organ fails to perform its function, the general system\r\nbecomes both poisoned and ill-fed, and nervous exhaustion results. In most\r\ncases, however, the brain and spinal cord are first exhausted. The nerves\r\nof the organs are thus allowed too free play, and exhaust themselves\r\nlater. This systemic exhaustion has local expression in the testicles in\r\nthe male, in the womb and ovaries in the female. Through this the body is\r\nimperfectly supplied with natural tonics (antitoxins) formed by the\r\nstructures, and the general nervous exhaustion becomes still more\r\ncomplete. All the organs of the body are weakened in their function.\r\nPractically the neurasthenic in regard to his organs has taken on a\r\ndegenerative function albeit not degenerating in structure, since the\r\nrestlessness of the organs is a return to the undue expenditure of force\r\nwhich occurs in the lower animals in proportion as it is unchecked by a\r\ncentral nervous system. Through the influence of various exhausting\r\nagencies the spinal cord and the brain lose the gains of evolution and the\r\nneurasthenic is no longer adjusted to environment. Since the reproductive\r\norgans suffer particularly, children born after the acquirement of nervous\r\nexhaustion, more or less checked in development as the influence of\r\natavism is healthy or not, repeat degenerations in the structure of their\r\norgans, which in the parent were represented by neurasthenic disorders in\r\nfunction. As the ovaries of the neurasthenic women generally exhibit\r\nprominently the effects of the nervous exhaustion, the offspring of these\r\ndo not retain enough vigour to pass through the normal process of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nHEREDITY AND ATAVISM\r\n\r\n\r\nHeredity, like other biologic factors, starts with the cell. As elsewhere\r\npointed out, reproduction is first unicellular in type and involves an\r\nexpenditure of nutritive force antagonistic to the growth of the cell. As\r\nGeddes remarks,[66] no one can dispute that the nutritive, vegetative, or\r\nself-regarding processes within the plant or animal are as opposed to the\r\nreproductive, multiplying, species-regarding processes, as income to\r\nexpenditure or as building up to breaking down. But within the ordinary\r\nnutritive or vegetative functions of the body there is necessarily a\r\ncontinuous antithesis between two tissue-changing sets of processes,\r\nconstructive and destructive metabolism. The contrast between these two\r\nprocesses is seen throughout nature, whether in the alternating phases of\r\ncell-life or in the great antithesis of growth and reproduction.\r\n\r\nThe starfish, deprived of an arm, replaces this by a fresh growth; crabs\r\ncan renew the great claws which they have lost in fighting; even as high\r\nup as the lizard the loss of a leg or a tail can be made good. In a great\r\nvariety of cases a kind of physiological forgiveness is shown in the\r\nreparation of even serious injuries. Now this \"regeneration,\" as it is\r\ncalled, is a process of reproduction. By continuous growth the cells of a\r\npersistent stump are able to reproduce the entire number. A sponge, a\r\nhydra or a sea-anemone may be cut into pieces with the result that each\r\nfragment grows into a new organism. The same is done with many plants; and\r\nthough the division is artificial the result shows how very far from\r\nunique is the process spoken of as reproduction, which is but more or less\r\ndiscontinuous growth. This is well shown in the evolution onward\r\ninsensibly from cases of continuous budding, as in sponge or rosebush, to\r\ndiscontinuous budding in hydra zoophyte and tiger-lily, where the\r\noffspring vegetatively produced are sooner or later set free.\r\n\r\nThe enormous expenditure of force required for unicellular reproduction is\r\nlessened by conjugation with another cell through satisfaction of cell\r\nhunger; and this, by making two cells do the work of one, lessens the\r\namount of nutritive force expended by each. Evolution in fertilisation has\r\nthe following steps:--\r\n\r\n    I. Formation of plasmodia.\r\n   II. Multiple conjugation.\r\n  III. Conjugation of the two similar cells.\r\n   IV. Union of incipiently dimorphic (different) cells.\r\n    V. Fertilisation of differentiated sex elements.\r\n\r\nAs Maupas has shown, by the time conjugation of two similar cells is\r\nreached, the paranucleus in both is incipiently hermaphroditic. The\r\nimpelling force leading to conjugation is, as Rolph has shown, cell\r\nhunger. Conjugation, he remarks, is a necessity for satisfaction, a\r\ngnawing hunger which drives the animal to engulf its neighbour, to\r\nisophagy (self-eating). The process of conjugation is only a special form\r\nof nutrition which occurs because of a reduction of the nutritive income\r\nor an increase of the nutritive needs. It is an \"isophagy\" which occurs in\r\nplace of \"heterophagy\" (eating of others). \"The less nutritive, and\r\ntherefore smaller, hungrier, and more mobile organism is the male, the\r\nmore nutritive and usually relatively more quiescent organism the female.\r\nTherefore, too, is it that the small starving male seeks out the large,\r\nwell-nourished female for purpose of conjugation, to which the latter, the\r\nlarger and better nourished, is on its own motive less inclined.\" The\r\nunicellular type of reproduction long remains after sex differentiation\r\nhas occurred and assumes the form of parthenogenesis (virgin generation).\r\nThe phenomena of this demonstrate that the female element is the highest\r\nin evolution. Spitzka[67] has shown that the ovum possesses an inherent\r\nactivity independently of fructification. How far this may extend in the\r\ndirection of more mature development is shown by what is known about\r\nparthenogenesis. This is the development of living beings without a\r\nfather. Bees, some butterflies, ants and wasps notoriously multiply their\r\nkind without sexual congress. As a rule the parthenogenetic offspring are\r\nthemselves incapable of further procreating their kind. But to this there\r\nare remarkable exceptions. The aphides multiply for many generations\r\nwithout the intervention of a male. Weigenbergh has shown that the\r\nsilk-moth can be propagated as long as the male element is permitted to\r\nact at every fourth generation. The _Artemsia salina_, a minute\r\ncrustacean living in saline springs, reproduces its kind for years\r\nwithout a male being present, males being produced at definite intervals\r\nonly (Von Siebold). Among the vertebrata parthenogenetic development has\r\nalso been observed, though rarely reaching maturity. Thus, segmentation\r\noccurs in unfertilised ova of the chicken (Oellacher), of the fish\r\n(Burnett and Agassiz), and of frogs (Moquia-Tanden). Spitzka has seen a\r\nblastoderm form in unfertilised ova of the toad-fish (_Batrachus tau_).\r\nHensen isolated the oviducts of a rabbit, thus rendering the admission of\r\nsemen impossible, while the ova, discharged at heat, were compelled to\r\nremain in these oviducts. Three years later he killed the animal and found\r\nthe ova had developed into twisted, club-shaped, hollow sacs. The\r\ndevelopment in the female ovary (also, though very rarely, in the male\r\ntesticle and parotid gland, which show such a remarkable metastatic\r\nsympathy in mumps), of dermoid cysts (containing bones recognisable as\r\nmaxillaries with teeth, hair, and skin, rudimentary bowel, gland, and\r\nbrain traces), even in undoubted virgins, proves that even the human ovum\r\nis capable of parthenogenetic development. While such development, so far\r\nas known to science, is always abortive, and while, as Washington Irving\r\nremarks, the ingenious maiden who to-day would attribute conception to any\r\nother cause than sexual congress would find it difficult to overcome the\r\nprejudice of scientists, yet embryology, while declaring immaculate\r\ngeneration improbable, does not pronounce it impossible. A worker bee may\r\nbe an offspring of an unimpregnated queen bee. What is a regular\r\noccurrence in one class of animals is sometimes observed as an\r\nexceptional one in another class. If the startling and apparently\r\nmiraculous nature of a virgin generation of a living child be regarded as\r\nthe sole objection to receiving such a fact, its defender might urge that\r\nthe virgin generation of a dermoid cyst with all the traces, however\r\naborted, of vertebrate organisation, is only a shade less startling and\r\nmiraculous.\r\n\r\nThis power of parthenogenesis, however, cannot continue indefinitely\r\nwithout extinction. This has been shown by the careful experiments of\r\nMaupas, who had observed 215 generations of an infusorian without sexual\r\nunion. He found that then the family became extinct. Powers of nutrition,\r\ndivision, and conjugation with unrelated forms come to a standstill. The\r\nfirst symptom of this senile degeneration is decrease in size, which may\r\ngo on till the individuals only measure a quarter of their normal\r\nproportions. Various internal structures then follow suit \"until at last\r\nformless abortions occur, incapable of living and reproducing themselves.\"\r\nThe nuclear changes are no less momentous. The important paranucleus is\r\nfatally sterile. The larger nucleus may also become affected, \"the\r\nchromatin gradually disappears altogether.\" Physiologically, too, the\r\norganisms become manifestly weaker, though there is excessive sexual\r\nexcitation. Such senile decay of the individuals and of the isolated\r\nfamily inevitably ends in death. Sexual union in those infusorians,\r\ndangerous perhaps for the individual life, a loss of time so far as\r\nimmediate multiplication is concerned, is, in a new sense, necessary for\r\nthe species. The life runs in cycles of a sexual division which are\r\nstrictly limited. Conjugation with unrelated forms must occur else the\r\nwhole life ebbs. Without it the protozoa, which some have called\r\n\"immortal,\" die a natural death. Conjugation is the necessary condition of\r\ntheir eternal youth and immortality.\r\n\r\nStarting from this standpoint the relative functions of the two sexes in\r\nheredity are apparent. The original function of reproduction, that of cell\r\ndivision, is the part of the female. The male in the lower instances\r\nsimply supplies the female with nutriment. Thus in certain plants there is\r\nnothing but a subtle osmosis between the sexes. This is also the case with\r\nsome of the lower infusoria. With a rise in evolution protoplasm becomes\r\ndifferentiated. At the outset of the subject of heredity it is evident,\r\ntherefore, that the female furnishes the type which is best capable of\r\ndevelopment when properly nourished by a highly developed male. To\r\ndeficiencies in both particulars are due defects and variations in the\r\noffspring. As the product of fructification is longest under the nutritive\r\ncontrol of the female, her influence is most emphatic in either redeeming\r\ndefects or producing them. Heredity, according to Ribot, Spitzka, Fere,\r\nand others, is divisible into direct heredity, indirect heredity, and,\r\nmore dubiously, telegony. Direct heredity consists in the transmission of\r\npaternal and maternal qualities to the children. This form of heredity has\r\ntwo aspects: (1) The child takes after father and mother equally as\r\nregards both physical and moral characters, a case strictly speaking of\r\nvery rare occurrence; or (2) the child, while taking after both parents,\r\nmore especially resembles one of them. Here again distinction must be made\r\nbetween two cases. The first of these is when the heredity takes place in\r\nthe same sex from father to son, from mother to daughter. The other which\r\noccurs more frequently, is where heredity occurs between different\r\nsexes--from father to daughter or from mother to son. Reversional heredity\r\nor atavism consists in the reproduction in the descendants of the moral or\r\nphysical qualities of their ancestors. It occurs frequently between\r\ngrandfather and grandson, as well as between grandmother and\r\ngranddaughter. Collateral or indirect heredity, which is of rarer\r\noccurrence than the foregoing, and is simply a form of atavism, subsists,\r\nas indicated by the name, between individuals and their ancestors in the\r\nindirect line--uncle, or grand-uncle and nephew, aunt and niece. Finally\r\n(3) there is telegony, or the heredity of influence, very rare from the\r\nphysiological point of view, which consists in reproduction in the\r\nchildren by a second marriage of some peculiarity belonging to a former\r\nspouse.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with heredity the position of Weismann and others, that\r\nacquired characters cannot be inherited, needs a short examination. In his\r\nlater work Weismann has practically abandoned the essential basis of his\r\nposition by admitting that maternal nutrition may play a part in\r\ndetermining variation. He[68] now asserts that the origin of a variation\r\nis equally independent of selection and amphimixis, and is due to the\r\nconstant occurrence of slight inequalities of nutrition in the germ plasm.\r\nAs acquired characters affecting the constitution of the parents are\r\ncertain to affect the nutrition of the germ plasm, it is therefore\r\nobvious, according to Weismann's admission, that acquired characters or\r\ntheir consequences will be inherited. This is an emphatic though\r\nconcealed abandonment of the central position of Weismann.\r\n\r\nOne of the stock arguments of the Weismann school is drawn from results of\r\nthe Jewish rite of circumcision. While the operation is not calculated to\r\nmake a profound impression on the constitution, and furthermore, as being\r\nperformed on the male, less likely to affect the race, still the alleged\r\nnon-inheritance of its results is much over-estimated. William Wolf,[69]\r\nof Baltimore, Maryland, who has circumcised six hundred Jewish children,\r\nfinds on careful examination, that 2 per cent. were born partially\r\ncircumcised and 6 per cent. were born with a short prepuce. P. C.\r\nRemondino,[70] of Los Angeles, California, has seen a large number of\r\ncases of absence of the prepuce which proved to be hereditary. After a\r\nconfinement his attention was once called to the child by the nurse, who\r\nthought it was deformed. The nurse was astonished at the size and\r\nappearance of the glans penis. On examination the prepuce was found to be\r\ncompletely absent. On inquiry, the father and another son, born more than\r\ntwenty years previously (comprising every male member of the family), were\r\nfound to have been born with the glands fully exposed. He has seen a\r\nFrench family similarly affected.\r\n\r\nSimilar, but much stronger, results have been obtained by me through the\r\ncourtesy of the Reverend Drs. S. Bauer, M. A. Cohen, and B. Gordon, all of\r\nChicago. Dr. Bauer, who has been seventeen years in the practice of the\r\nreligious rite of circumcision, has circumcised 3,400 boys and has found\r\npreputial absence in about 3-1/2 per cent. of the cases. Dr. Cohen, who\r\nhas been two decades in the practice, has performed 10,000 circumcisions.\r\nHe has found the prepuce wanting in 500 cases; partially developed in 300\r\ncases; slightly developed in 2,000 cases. Dr. Gordon has performed 4,400\r\ncircumcisions in twenty-five years. He has found the prepuce absent in 15\r\ncases; partly wanting in 200, and slightly developed in 2,200 cases.\r\nThese, it should be remembered, are only cases where preputial change\r\nforced itself on the observer, who was not pursuing investigations on this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nThe volume of Hebrew casuistic religious literature collected in the\r\nMedrash, evidences as I have elsewhere[71] shown the frequency of\r\ncongenital preputial defect.\r\n\r\nThat acquired characters can be transmitted has been definitely shown by\r\nthe experiments of George Roe Lockwood,[72] of New York, anent hereditary\r\ntransmission of mutilations. White mice were selected, as they begin to\r\nbreed when thirty days old, and breed every thirty days. He bred in-and-in\r\nfor thirty-six generations, destroying the weakly, and thus obtained finer\r\nanimals than the first pair. He selected a pair, caged them by themselves,\r\nand clipped the tails of the young. When they were old enough to breed, he\r\nselected a pair and clipped the tails of their progeny. In the seventh\r\ngeneration he obtained some tailless mice, and finally a tailless breed.\r\nThe experiments have one possible element of error; white mice, like all\r\nalbinoes, are a degenerate type. At the same time these experiments show\r\nthat accidental mutilations favoured by circumstances are inherited.\r\n\r\nEimer[73] reports the case of a pair of long-tailed pointers which had\r\nonce produced a litter of long-tailed pups. In order to obtain\r\nshort-tailed pups the owner had the tails of both shortened. The bitch\r\nfrom that time produced repeatedly short-tailed pups only. As the most\r\ncareful attention was paid to the parents, no error can be suspected in\r\nthis case, which, moreover, excites no surprise among dog-breeders.\r\n\r\nBrown-Sequard[74] has shown that a peculiar alteration of the shape of the\r\near or a partial closing of the eyelids is inherited by the offspring of\r\nanimals in which these changes were caused by dividing the sympathetic.\r\nExophthalmia (eye protrusion) was inherited by guinea-pigs in whose\r\nparents this protrusion of the eyes had occurred after an injury to the\r\nspinal cord, and so were bruises and dry gangrene, as well as other\r\ntrophic disturbances in the ear, due in the parents to an injury to the\r\nrestiform body of the brain. Loss of certain phalanges or of whole toes of\r\nthe hind feet which had occurred in the parents in consequence of division\r\nof the sciatic nerve was inherited. Diseased conditions of the sciatic\r\nnerve occurred in the offspring of guinea-pigs in which this nerve was\r\ndivided. Forty guinea-pigs in which one or both eyes showed more or less\r\nmorbid change were descended from three individuals in which one eye had\r\nbecome diseased in consequence of transverse section of the restiform\r\nbody. Twenty guinea-pigs exhibited muscular atrophy on the upper and lower\r\nsides of the thigh, when in the parents such atrophy had been caused by\r\nsection of the sciatic nerve.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Brown-Sequard, Westphal, Dupuy[75] and Obersteiner,\r\nwhich show that artificially induced epilepsy is inherited, still further\r\nbear out the conclusions resultant on the inheritance of these\r\nmutilations. Indeed, Weismann has been forced to that _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ in science, narrowly limited definitions, in order to maintain\r\nhis position. \"But although I hold it improbable,\" he remarks, \"that\r\nindividual variability can depend on a direct action of external\r\ninfluences upon the germ cells and their contained germ plasm, because, as\r\nfollows from sundry facts, the molecular structure of the germ plasm must\r\nbe very difficult to change, yet it is by no means to be implied that this\r\nstructure may not possibly be altered by influences of the same kind\r\ncontinuing for a very long time. This much may be maintained: that\r\ninfluences which are mostly of variable nature, tending now in one\r\ndirection, now in another, can hardly produce a change in the structure of\r\nthe germ plasm, and this is the reason why the cause of inheritable\r\nindividual differences must be sought elsewhere than in these varying\r\ninfluences.\" \"No one has doubted,\" he says, in reply to objections made by\r\nVirchow, \"that there are a number of congenital deformities, birth-marks,\r\nand other individual peculiarities which are inherited. But these are\r\nacquired characters in the above sense. True, they must once have appeared\r\nfor the first time, but we cannot say exactly from what causes; we only\r\nknow that at least a great proportion of them proceed from the germ\r\nitself, and must therefore be due to alterations of the germinal\r\nsubstance. If Virchow could show that any single one of these hereditary\r\ndeformities had its origin in the action of some external cause upon the\r\nalready formed body (soma) of the individual and not upon the germ cell,\r\nthen the inheritance of acquired characters would be proved. But this no\r\none has yet succeeded in proving, often as it has been maintained.\"\r\n\r\nThe crucial test which Weismann demands is furnished by Dupuy,[76] who\r\nmade one thousand experiments on guinea-pigs to the fifth generation,\r\ncritically rejecting all results which did not correspond to the most\r\nrigid tests of direct heredity, excluding all instances of indirect\r\nheredity, however demonstrable. He found that certain lesions of the\r\nspinal cord, or the brain or the sciatic nerve, give rise in guinea-pigs\r\nto epilepsy.\r\n\r\nIn from three to six weeks after the operation an alteration in the\r\nnutrition takes place in an area of skin which is limited by a line\r\nstarting from the outer canthus of the eye, and running to the median line\r\non the upper lip, enclosing the nostril, thence backward enclosing the\r\nlower jaw, to the anterior portion of the shoulder to the median dorsal\r\nline, to the base of the ear and inner canthus of the eye. The alteration\r\nin nutrition occurs on the side corresponding to the injury. The pain,\r\nheat and cold sense disappear by degrees, while touch appears to be\r\nexalted. Very soon, tickling this zone of skin gives rise to twitchings\r\nlimited to the muscles of the eye and the eyelids on the same side. Later,\r\nthe muscles of the mouth and of the face are affected, still later the\r\ncontractions become more general, until the whole side is the seat of\r\nconvulsions, then the convulsions attack the other side also. When things\r\nhave come to this point the convulsions precede by a very short time\r\ncomplete loss of consciousness. If the subject of experiment be white, it\r\nis found that there is paleness of the face, but in all cases there is\r\nlittle foam at the mouth and dilatation of the pupils. The animal\r\nsometimes utters a cry corresponding to the epileptic cry in the man. Not\r\nonly are the convulsions identical with those in epileptic man, but there\r\nis also loss of consciousness, a state of torpor, stupor, and even\r\nsometimes insanity. When epilepsy is due to the destruction of the sciatic\r\nnerve, the foot of the affected side loses the two outer toes, so that the\r\nanimal has only one toe, the inner. When young are born to such a parent\r\nor parents (for it matters not whether one or both of the parents have\r\nbeen operated upon), they have very often only one toe on the posterior\r\nfoot. Sometimes, however, they have additional toes, which, in this case,\r\nare attached by a pedicle to the limb.\r\n\r\nThose peculiarities observed in the parents are in all their details\r\nwitnessed in the guinea-pigs hereditarily born toeless, who have developed\r\nepileptic phenomena. In Dupuy's cases not only is the epileptic tendency\r\n(of which Weismann gives a wholly imaginative microbic explanation)\r\ninherited, but the very stigmata (loss of toes) which mark development of\r\nthe parental epilepsy.\r\n\r\nE. D. Cope's[77] careful studies of the effects of impacts and strains on\r\nthe feet of mammals are testimony difficult for Weismann to explain, since\r\nthey also meet his requirements.\r\n\r\nWeismann's admission of the inheritance of a tuberculous habit must\r\nlogically, from the standpoint of degeneracy, be regarded as destroying\r\nhis claims.\r\n\r\nKiernan has observed the case of a female cat in which brain mutilation\r\nhad been induced to secure secondary cerebro-spinal degenerations. The\r\nmutilations were made under antiseptic precautions. The descendants of\r\nthis cat had traces of the mutilation, and its results until the fourth\r\ngeneration, when the breed became extinct. This instance certainly fulfils\r\nall Weismann requirements.\r\n\r\nIn the Lambert family a skin deformity, the last result of degeneracy in\r\nprevious generations, was transmitted. This peculiarity appeared first,\r\naccording to Proctor,[78] in the person of Edward Lambert, whose whole\r\nbody, except his face, the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet,\r\nwas covered with a horny excrescence. He was the father of six children,\r\nall of whom as soon as they had reached the age of six weeks presented the\r\nsame peculiarity. The only one of them who lived transmitted the\r\npeculiarity to all his sons. For five generations all the male members of\r\nthe family were distinguished by the horny excrescence which had adorned\r\nthe body of Edward Lambert.\r\n\r\nShwe-Maong, one of the hairless Burmese, when thirty years old had his\r\nwhole body covered with silky hairs, which attained a length of nearly\r\nfive inches on the shoulders and spine. He had four daughters, but only\r\none of them resembled him. She had a son who was hairy like his\r\ngrandfather. The case of this family illustrates rather curiously the\r\nrelation between the hair and teeth; for Shwe-Maong retained his milk\r\nteeth till he was twenty (when he attained puberty); then they were\r\nreplaced by nine teeth only, five in the upper and four in the lower jaw.\r\nEight of these were incisors, the ninth (in the upper jaw) being a cuspid\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nCertain motor expressions of disturbed functions are also inherited.\r\nGalton describes the case of a man who, when he lay fast asleep on his\r\nback in bed, had the curious trick of raising his right arm slowly in\r\nfront of his face, up to his forehead, and then dropping it with a jerk,\r\nso that the wrist fell heavily on the bridge of his nose. The trick did\r\nnot occur every night, but occasionally, and was independent of any\r\nascertained cause. Sometimes it was repeated incessantly for an hour or\r\nmore. The gentleman's nose was prominent and its bridge often became sore\r\nfrom blows which it received. At one time an awkward sore was produced\r\nthat was long in healing on account of the recurrence, night after night,\r\nof the blows which first caused it. His wife had to remove the buttons\r\nfrom the wrist of his nightgown, as it made severe scratches, and some\r\nmeans were attempted of tying his arm. Many years after his death his son\r\nmarried a lady who had never heard of the family incident. She, however,\r\nobserved precisely the same peculiarity in her husband; but his nose, from\r\nnot being particularly prominent, has never as yet suffered from the\r\nblows. The trick does not occur when he is half asleep, as, for example,\r\nwhen he is dozing in his armchair, but the moment he is fast asleep he is\r\napt to begin. It, as with his father, is intermittent, sometimes ceasing\r\nfor many nights, and sometimes almost incessant during a part of every\r\nnight. It is performed, as it was with his father, with his right hand.\r\nOne of his children, a girl, has inherited the same trick. She performs it\r\nlikewise with the right hand but in a slightly modified form; for after\r\nraising the arm she does not allow the wrist to drop upon the bridge of\r\nthe nose, but the palm of her half-closed hand falls over and down the\r\nnose, striking it rather rapidly, a decided improvement on the father's\r\nand grandfather's method. The trick is intermittent in the girl's case\r\nalso, sometimes not occurring for periods of several months, but sometimes\r\nalmost incessantly. These \"tricks\" suggest nocturnal epilepsy, however.\r\n\r\nThe face of a child is often fully developed, yet, owing to some of the\r\nconstitutional diseases, arrested development of the face at this point\r\ntakes place. The second generation inherits this deformity, while the\r\ngrandparents possess normally developed faces.\r\n\r\nThe following case came under my own immediate observation. The\r\ngrandfather was in the habit of sitting in front of the fire with fingers\r\nlocked together twirling the thumbs in one direction, and then\r\noccasionally knocking the thumb nails together. Two of his three sons\r\ninherited this habit; the third brother had the habit of biting his nails\r\nwhen in a fit of abstraction. The nephew of the last has a similar habit\r\nunder the like conditions. The children of this nephew have in two\r\ninstances shown a tendency to pick at the nails when in an unconscious\r\nstate, from acute disease. The third child has a periodical tendency to do\r\nthe same since it was four months old.\r\n\r\nV. P. Gibney,[79] of New York, has reported a family consisting of father\r\nand mother, five children, and one grandchild. The father and mother are\r\nsemi-ambidextrous. All of the children and the grandchild are\r\nsemi-ambidextrous to an annoying degree; all of the movements which they\r\nperform with one hand are simultaneously performed by the other hand. The\r\ngirls are obliged to use only one hand when dressing themselves, or when\r\ncutting patterns, and hold the other hand down by their side, because the\r\ntwo hands perform the same movements at the same time and would interfere\r\nwith each other.\r\n\r\nOne factor in heredity concerning which there has been much dispute, and\r\nwhose existence has been denied because of certain theories anent the\r\nnerve connection of the mother and foetus, is that of maternal\r\nimpressions. As Fere[80] has shown, the foetus exhibits very decided\r\nreaction to sensory impressions on the mother. He cites cases of several\r\nwomen who, often in the midst of an ordinary dream, producing but very\r\nmoderate excitation, not generally interrupting sleep, were awakened by\r\nfoetal movements. The dreams had nothing of the nightmare which would\r\ncause sudden contraction under the influence of a terrifying idea. They\r\nwere merely the ordinary phenomena of sleep. Mental changes of the mother\r\nhence excite motor reactions in the foetus, and, as with sensorial\r\nexcitations, these reactions are stronger in the foetus than in the\r\nmother. The mechanism of these motor reactions is, Fere points out,\r\nobviously due to unconscious and involuntary movement of the muscle walls\r\nof the womb. The organisation of a morbid predisposition may be largely\r\ninfluenced by an accident accompanying conception or gestation. In some\r\ndegenerates cannot be found a trace of hereditary defect. The fact cited\r\nexplains how sensorial excitations or repeated and violent emotions in the\r\nmother during pregnancy give rise to profound nutritive troubles in the\r\nfoetus, and especially in its nervous system. These congenitally\r\ndegenerated beings (_ab utero_) can hardly be distinguished from those\r\nhaving direct heredity. A considerable number of cases of epilepsy,\r\nidiocy, &c., are recognised as having arisen from alcoholism in the\r\nmother. Psychic troubles in the mother may react upon the foetus in an\r\nanalogous way. The prominent facts which show the influence of the psychic\r\nstate of the mother upon the somatic condition of the foetus explain the\r\naction of the imagination of the mother upon the development of the\r\nproduct of conception. The opinion which refers the origin of birth-marks\r\nto intense mental impressions on the part of the mother is not without\r\nphysiological foundation. Concurrently with the motor phenomena,\r\nstigmata[81] may become developed by vascular and nutritive troubles\r\nproduced under the influence of a strong excitation or by the imagination.\r\n\r\nSpitzka,[82] who approached maternal impressions from an actively\r\nsceptical standpoint, had his scepticism shaken by specimens (preserved in\r\nthe British Museum) of newly hatched chicks, all of which had a curved\r\nbeak like a parrot, and the toes set back as in that bird. According to\r\nthe report of the curator the hens in the farmyard where these\r\nmonstrosities were hatched had been frightened by a parrot which, having\r\nescaped, fluttered among them some time before the eggs were laid and\r\ngreatly frightened those from whom the malformed chicks were received. It\r\nis certain that the chief argument of those who deny that maternal\r\nimpressions are transmitted is defeated by this case. They have usually\r\nasserted that the explanation of the nature and cause of a birth-mark was\r\nalways an after-thought on the part of the mother. But there was no\r\nafter-thought in this case. The hens did not publish a theory as to the\r\nmalformation of their chicks. It was their owner, a gentleman of\r\nintelligence and culture, who observed the casual occurrence, and who\r\nverified the almost photographic truthfulness of the germ monstrosity by\r\ndepositing it in a museum as a permanent record at which none may cavil.\r\n\r\nSince then, the singular freaks attributable to maternal impressions of\r\nwomen, seen by Spitzka, have become so numerous that he has been compelled\r\nto negative the argument that they were merely accidental coincidences. He\r\nhas never seen an idiotic, malformed child or one afflicted with morbid\r\nimpulses derived from healthy parents free from hereditary taint in which\r\na maternal impression could not be traced.\r\n\r\nIn a large number a direct correspondence between the maternal impression\r\nand the nature of the deformity or peculiarity could be discovered. He\r\nreports the case of a woman, about five months pregnant, who, while\r\nstanding in her yard, saw her husband stab into the belly of a goat he had\r\nslaughtered. The sight of the suddenly protruding visceral mass, which\r\nhappened to be imperfectly bilobar, shocked her extremely, and, starting\r\nback, she, in her great revulsion, feeling a strange sensation at the nape\r\nof the neck or back of the head, clutched the former with her right hand.\r\nThe impression continued to haunt her. When the child was born and she\r\nsaw its deformity she instantly exclaimed, \"Oh, the intestines of that\r\ngoat!\" At the back of its head the child had a large tumour of the\r\nconsistency of a loose sac of a bluish colour, showing convolutions\r\ninterpreted by the mother as a reproduction of the intestinal convolutions\r\nthat had so shocked her. In reality they were the convolutions of a hernia\r\ncontaining the posterior ends of both cerebral hemispheres. The accidental\r\nresemblance of the deformity to the mental impressions was striking.\r\n\r\nA. Lagorio[83] brought before the Chicago Medical Society several cases in\r\nwhich maternal impressions had produced decidedly abnormal births with\r\ndeformities resembling those feared by the mother. Kiernan, in discussing\r\nthese, pointed out that all were instances of checked development. He was\r\nof opinion that moral shock, generally directed, played the chief part in\r\nmaternal impressions through checking development and causing either\r\ngeneral or local reversion. Here, as Spitzka[84] shows, the statistical\r\nmethod can be applied. It has been long known that profound grief, mental\r\nor physical shock acting on the mother, produce cerebral defect or\r\ngenerally arrested development in the offspring. Of 92 children born in\r\nParis during the great siege, 1870-71, 64 had mental or physical anomalies\r\nand the remaining 28 were weakly, 21 were intellectually defective\r\n(imbecile or idiotic), and 8 showed moral or emotional insanity. These\r\nfigures, furnished by Legrand du Saulle, justify the popular designation\r\nby the working men of Paris of the defective children born in 1871 as\r\n\"_enfants du siege_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the great Chicago fire in 1871 birth-marks, deformities, and mental\r\ndefects were noticed to occur among the offspring whose mothers were\r\npregnant with them pending the exciting time during and after the\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nSpitzka has seen in practice, constitutionally melancholic or mentally\r\ndefective children in whom no other predisposing cause could be discovered\r\nthan that the mother was struggling with direct or indirect results of the\r\nfinancial crisis of 1873. In several of these cases the death of the\r\nfather was a contributory cause of maternal depression. In Berlin the\r\nfinancial crisis of 1875-80 was followed by an increase in the number of\r\nidiots born. Lombroso attributes a series of cases of microcephaly to\r\nprofound mental impressions occurring during pregnancy. To the same class\r\nof cases belong the hermaphrodites born by mothers who have been\r\nfrightened in their first pregnancy and who continue to bear\r\nhermaphrodites. The continual and not ill-founded dread that the\r\nsucceeding children may resemble the first is to be regarded as a\r\ncontributory cause. Observers who have had a large experience with\r\nillegitimate births believe that the mental agony suffered by the\r\nunfortunate mother reacts upon the foetus, causing arrest of development,\r\nand thus accounting for the frequent occurrence of idiocy in illegitimate\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nThe influence of maternal diet on the foetus is excellently illustrated in\r\nthe results of the \"fruit diet\" advised by certain vegetarians. Here the\r\nchildren[85] become, as Elise Berwig has recently shown, rickety,\r\nirritable, peevish, liable to convulsions, morally peculiar, and otherwise\r\ndefective in contrast with children born of the same parents without\r\n\"fruit diet\" during pregnancy.\r\n\r\nKiernan,[86] after citing instances reported by Amabile, Carson, F. B.\r\nEarle, Erlenmeyer, F. H. Hubbard, C. H. Hughes, Mattison, and others, of\r\ncongenital opium habit where opium was needed to preserve the infant\r\nduring the first months of life, states that inheritance of the opium\r\nhabit seems at first an isolated phenomenon, but zoologists have pointed\r\nout that pigeons whose ancestors were fed on poppies became intractable to\r\nopium. Murrell found that the same was relatively true in England of\r\npersons descended from Bedfordshire ancestors who used infusions of\r\npoppies as a prophylactic against malaria. Nervous diseases were, however,\r\nrelatively prevalent in these districts. Narcotic habits in the ancestors\r\nproduces descendants in whom the normal checks on excessive nervous action\r\nare removed, so that paranoiacs, periodical lunatics, epileptics,\r\nhysterics, congenital criminals, congenital paupers, or other degenerates\r\nresult. This influence is most strongly exerted when the maternal ancestor\r\nis the one affected, for to her is committed the development of the ovum\r\nprior to conception and of the child subsequently. If either is interfered\r\nwith by a habit, a being defective in some respects is the result. The\r\ndirect inheritance of the opium habit has been shown experimentally by\r\nLevenstein, who found by experiments on pregnant dogs and rabbits that the\r\nuse of opium during pregnancy produced either abortion or still-births, or\r\nrapidly dying offspring.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner Rennert[87] has shown that lead-poisoning occurring in\r\nthe mother is apt to produce macrocephalism with frequent idiocy in the\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nThis brings the observer face to face with the problem of morbid heredity.\r\nIt may at once be admitted that, as has been claimed by a large number of\r\nobservers, morbid heredity, especially in its graver forms, is much less\r\nfrequent than at first would be expected. J. P. Gray, of Utica, New York,\r\nwent so far as to claim that disease is never transmitted, but this is\r\ncontradicted by his own hospital reports, which, to the day of his death,\r\ncontained a table headed, \"Statistics of hereditary transmission of the\r\ndisease.\" It is true, however, that the descendants of a victim of\r\nmorbidity or abnormality do not always exhibit the morbidity or\r\nabnormality of the ancestor. In some cases all apparent morbidity or\r\nabnormality is wanting. In other cases slighter abnormalities are to be\r\ndetected. Here the observer is brought face to face with the operation of\r\ntwo general principles which are interdependent: the transmutation of\r\nheredity and atavism, or \"throwing back\" as the cattle breeders call it.\r\nTennyson voices the general erroneous opinion of the always evil effects\r\nof atavism in his \"Locksley Hall Sixty Years After\":--\r\n\r\n  \"Evolution ever climbing after some ideal good\r\n  And Reversion ever dragging Evolution in the mud.\"\r\n\r\nAs Kiernan has shown, atavism at times tends to preserve the type, and\r\noffsets the influence of degeneracy. This element of atavism underlies not\r\nmerely the production of the sound scions of degenerate stock, but also\r\nthose in whom the degeneracy affects the earlier and not the later\r\nacquirements of the race. The contrast of the moral imbecile who is unable\r\nto acquire an idea of right, or the idiot of the lowest grade who can\r\nhardly be taught to keep himself clean, with the otherwise sound, sane,\r\nable victim of hereditary gout, is very great. Yet all the links of the\r\nchain connecting, in the same family, these contrasted types, can often be\r\nfound. The law laid down as to absolute extinction through degeneracy by\r\nMorel and others can only be regarded as absolutely true when applied to a\r\ngiven type rather than the race as a whole. Indeed, environment may play a\r\npart in preserving a degenerate who would otherwise die out. Thus in\r\nsocieties at a certain stage of culture imbeciles, paupers, lunatics, and\r\ncongenital criminals live at large and even propagate through legal\r\nmarriage. The seemingly enormous increase of the defective class which\r\noccurs in frontier communities when the classes begin to be placed in\r\npublic institutions is an excellent illustration of this.\r\n\r\nManifestations of morbid heredity result not in inheritance of the whole\r\ndefect but in disturbance of relations of structure and hence of function,\r\nproducing, as Kiernan remarks, a constitutional deficiency which takes the\r\nline of least resistance. The extent and direction of this line of least\r\nresistance depend on the amount of healthy atavism which separate organs\r\nand structures of the body preserve. The line of least resistance\r\nsometimes taken is excellently illustrated in the occurrence of stigmata\r\nalready pointed out in the case of epileptic guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\nThis unilateral predisposition (which, as Kiernan has shown, is due\r\nusually to heredity or intra-uterine causes) may be artificially\r\nproduced. Kasparek[88] cut one sciatic nerve of a guinea-pig and (after\r\nall inflammatory symptoms had subsided) injected the opposite ear with\r\ncultures of pus microbes. He killed the animal after some days. The sound\r\nside was found free from suppuration, but immense abscesses existed on the\r\nside of the cut nerve. Such local predisposition was pointed out by\r\nMerrill[89] over forty years ago. This condition occurs, as Fere has\r\nshown,[90] in many systemic and infectious diseases which presents a\r\nlocalisation due to heredity, or determined by anterior morbid state of\r\nthe nervous symptom. Sometimes these manifestations are limited to the\r\nside free from nervous trouble.\r\n\r\nAs a rule they attack the side which is the predominant seat of nervous\r\nsymptoms. Fere points out that in chromatic iris asymmetry the iris\r\n(coloured part of the eye) is most coloured on the side most affected by\r\narrest of development. Localisation of nervous trouble occurs on the side\r\nmost affected by hare-lip. Heuse has observed the co-existence on the same\r\nside of congenital cataract and of deformities of the skull and chest.\r\n\r\nHernia is often an expression of hereditary defect (Le Double) taking the\r\nunilateral line of least resistance. Testicle inflammations of microbic\r\norigin (venereal or otherwise) occur as a rule on the side where hernia is\r\nlocated in the groin. In one-sided malformations of ovary or testicle\r\n(decreased or increased in size, or changed in shape or location) microbe\r\ninflammation almost always occurs at the seat of the anomaly. This\r\nprinciple is illustrated in the experiments of Dupuy.[91] Here, while as a\r\nrule, the scions of guinea-pigs (rendered epileptic by section of the\r\nsciatic nerve) were epileptics and had deficient toes, still in some\r\nepilepsy resulted without the toe anomaly, while still more rarely the toe\r\nanomaly was present without the epilepsy.\r\n\r\nThe same principle is shown by certain observations of Charin and\r\nGley,[92] who for five years conducted experiments calculated to throw\r\nlight on the influence on the offspring of parental reception of virus.\r\nEither both male and female have been inoculated with the bacillus of blue\r\npus or its toxins, or but one animal has been inoculated. The results have\r\nnot been uniform. Most frequently there ensues sterility, abortion, or\r\nbirth of progeny that die immediately. In rare instances the offspring\r\nsurvive; more rarely still are they healthy. Certain rabbits (born of\r\nthese undeveloped animals) were provided with enormous epiphyses (ends of\r\nbones), the shafts of the bones being shortened. Two rabbits were born of\r\na couple of which the male alone received inoculations of sterilised\r\nculture. Five rabbits were born of these two, of which two were normal,\r\nand a third (whose ears were rudimentary) died in a few days. In the\r\nremaining two the ears comprised only fragments with jagged upper edges.\r\nThe tails were but two centimetres long. The external orifice of the\r\nvagina (one rabbit was a male and the other a female) was oblique. One of\r\nthe limbs (the hind in the male and the fore in the female) was much\r\nshorter than its fellow, the difference being four centimetres. The\r\nshortened limb ended in a kind of stump, there being no foot or toes.\r\n\r\nThese experiments illustrate the transformation of heredity, that is the\r\nmanifestations which show the line of least resistance that the morbid\r\nheredity has taken. As Moreau (de Tours) remarks,[93] \"An incorrect\r\nconception of the law of heredity looks for identical phenomena in each\r\nsucceeding generation. Some have refused to admit that mental faculties\r\nwere subject to heredity, because the mental characters of the descendants\r\nwere not precisely those of the progenitors. Each generation must copy the\r\npreceding. Father and son must present the spectacle of one being, having\r\ntwo births, and each time leading the same life, under the same\r\nconditions. But it is not in the heredity of functions, or of organic or\r\nintellectual facts that the application of the law of heredity must be\r\nsought, but at the very fountain-head of the organism, in its inmost\r\nconstitution. A family whose head is insane or epileptic does not of\r\nnecessity consist of lunatics or epileptics, but the children may be\r\nidiotic, paralytic, or scrofulous. What the parents transmit to the\r\nchildren is not insanity, but a vicious constitution which will manifest\r\nitself under various forms in epilepsy, hysteria, scrofula, rickets, &c.\r\nThis is what is to be understood by hereditary transmission.\"\r\n\r\nThe same position has been taken by Rush,[94] the pioneer American\r\nalienist; by Maudsley,[95] by Krafft-Ebing,[96] by Meynert, by Mercier, by\r\nFere,[97] and others. Morel,[98] the chief accepted apostle of the\r\ndoctrine of degeneracy, remarked, nearly at the same time as Moreau, that\r\n\"heredity does not mean the very disorder of the parents transmitted to\r\nthe children with the identical mental and physical symptoms observed in\r\nthe progenitors, but means transmission of organic disposition from\r\nparents to children. Alienists have, perhaps, more frequent occasion than\r\nothers for observing not merely this hereditary transmission, but likewise\r\nvarious transformations which occur in the descendants. They are aware\r\nthat simple neuropathy (nervous tendency) of the parents may produce in\r\nthe children an organic disposition resulting in mania or melancholia,\r\nnervous affections which in turn may produce more serious degeneracy and\r\nterminate in the idiocy or imbecility of those who form the last link in\r\nthe chain of hereditary transmission.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is true of the organism as a whole is true of the cells forming its\r\norgans. It should be remembered that while cell life is altruistic or\r\nsubordinated to the life of the organ, through the law of economy of\r\ngrowth, recognised by Aristotle, and through it to the life of the\r\norganism as a whole, altruism is not complete enough to prevent entirely a\r\nstruggle for existence on the part of the cells or the individual organs.\r\nWith rise in evolution this struggle decreases, to increase with the\r\nopposite procedure of degeneracy. From it results the phenomenon of\r\narrested and excessive development.\r\n\r\nAs Dareste has shown (and the fact has been corroborated by Spitzka[99]),\r\nembryologists can imitate natural malformation of the nerve centres by\r\nartificial methods. By wounding the embryonic and vascular areas of the\r\nchick's germ with a cataract needle, malformations are induced, varying in\r\nintensity and character with the earliness of the injury and its precise\r\nextent. More delicate injuries produce less monstrous development. Partial\r\nvarnishing or irregular heating of the egg-shell, in particular, results\r\nin anomalies comparable to microcephaly (little head) and cerebral\r\nasymmetry. This latter fact (showing the constancy of the injurious effect\r\nof so apparently slight an impression as the partial varnishing of a\r\nstructure not connected with the embryo at all directly) suggests the line\r\nof research to be followed in determining the source of the maternal and\r\nother impressions acting on the germ. What delicate problems are to be\r\nsolved in this connection may be inferred from the fact that eggs\r\nsubjected to the vibration and shocks of a railroad journey are checked in\r\ndevelopment for several days, or permanently arrested. A more delicate\r\nmolecular shock during the maturation of the ovum, during its\r\nfertilisation, or finally during embryonic stages of the more complex, and\r\ntherefore more readily disturbed and distorted human germ, accounts for\r\nthe disastrous effect of insanity, emotion, or other mental or physical\r\nshock of the parent on the offspring. The cause of the majority of\r\ncerebral deformities exists in the germ prior to the appearance of the\r\nseparate organs of the body. Artificial deformities produce analogous\r\nresults because they imitate original germ defects, either by mechanical\r\nremoval, or by some other interference with a special part of the germ.\r\nEarly involvement of the germ is shown by the fact that the somatic\r\nmalformations of the hereditary forms of insanity often involve the body\r\nelsewhere than in the nervous axis. The stigmata of heredity--defective\r\ndevelopment of the uro-genital system, deformities of the face and skull,\r\nirregular development of the teeth, misshapen ears and limbs--owe their\r\ngrave significance to this fact. Like deformities of the brain, these\r\nanomalies are also more marked and constant with the lower forms of the\r\nhereditarily based systematised perversions of the mind than the higher.\r\nIt is easy from these results to understand how far and how the nervous\r\nsystem has its part in the disorders of general development. It can be\r\neasily understood how the individuals who present most deformities are\r\nequally those who suffer from most decided disorders of the nervous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThese morbid manifestations of heredity occur in certain categories,\r\neither local as to organs or structures, or affecting the body as a whole.\r\nThese categories Moreau (de Tours) lucidly sums up as: First, absence of\r\nconception; second, retardation of conception; third, imperfect\r\nconception; fourth, incomplete products (monstrosities); fifth, products\r\nwhose mental, moral, and physical constitution is imperfect; sixth,\r\nproducts specially exposed to nervous disorders in order of frequency as\r\nfollows--epilepsy, imbecility or idiocy, deaf-mutism, insanity, cerebral\r\nparalysis, and other cerebral disorders; seventh, lymphatic products;\r\neighth, products which die in infancy in a greater proportion than sound\r\ninfants under like conditions; ninth, products which, although they escape\r\nthe stress of infancy, are less adapted than others to resist disease and\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of these morbid manifestations lies in the very\r\nfoundations of embryology. Bearing in mind the principles of individuation\r\npointed out by Spencer, it is easily understood how reversal of this\r\nprinciple would produce greater and greater destruction of the complex\r\nfunctions, resultant on increased reproductive power of cells (whose\r\nenvironment is not suited to such reproductions) and thus lead to such a\r\nstruggle for existence as to produce sterility (from interdestruction of\r\nthe ovum cells, or the cells forming the spermatozoon). This condition is\r\nfurther increased by the operation of two biologic principles. The first\r\nrelates to the cells or organs forming an organism. The second, as Von\r\nBaer has shown, deals with the relation of the organs to each other.\r\n\r\nVertebrate embryos of a common type, at their origin, assume successively\r\na number of common forms before definitely differentiating. Dareste points\r\nout that supernumerary organs do exist in these common forms at one phase\r\nof embryonic life. This community of embryonic types and this last fact\r\nexplain repetition of teratologic types or monstrosities in vertebrates.\r\nThis community of origin, moreover, indicates that a higher vertebrate\r\nembryo contains in essence the organs and potentialities of lower\r\nvertebrates, and that under the influence of heredity or accidental defect\r\nan organ belonging to another species may develop, or an organ constant in\r\na species may be lacking in an individual, without the necessity of\r\nexplaining the immediate effects by distant atavism. Some anomalies found\r\namong degenerates recall types less elevated than man, and very distant\r\nfrom him, even his possible Lemurian precursor.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from the principles already demonstrated that the secondary\r\neffects of infectious disorders and injuries are reproduced in various\r\ntypes in the offspring. The malformations of the limbs experimentally\r\ndemonstrated to be due to ancestral infection by Charin and Gley, and to\r\ninjury by Dupuy, noticeably occur in men. Moor has observed supernumerary\r\nfingers in an imbecile girl; her grandfather and one uncle are\r\npolydactylous and insane. F. S. Coolidge has had under observation a case\r\nwhich excellently depicts these deformities in men. Kiernan[100] reports\r\nthe case of a man whose grandfather and father had been prophets of the\r\nLord, as shown by the fact that on one side of the body they had six toes\r\nand six fingers, and the two sides of the body were unequal, the\r\nsix-fingered one being smaller than the other. This father and grandfather\r\nwere highly regarded in a secluded vale in Norway as religious teachers\r\nand for their power to cure disease by charm. The father had ten children,\r\nof whom three were born dead and six died in infancy. Kiernan's patient\r\nwas the only survivor of this family. During boyhood he experienced\r\nvarious persecutions, some by unseen agencies, some on the part of the\r\nvillagers, who towards the end of his father's life also persecuted the\r\nfather. These persecutions seem to have been withdrawal by the peasants of\r\ntheir belief in the father's ability to charm sickness out of cattle,\r\nevidently due to growing popular intelligence. This was regarded by the\r\nfather as the result of persecution by the devil, who was desirous of\r\ntrying him as Job was tried. It was revealed to him that his son should\r\nlikewise suffer persecution, which would also be the work of the devil.\r\nThe son heard unseen persons, who pointed him out in school as the son of\r\nthe sham wizard. In consequence he was avoided by all his schoolmates\r\nexcept the members of one family who still retained their belief in the\r\nfather's supernatural powers. Into this family the son married; then,\r\npressed by his unseen persecutors, he came to the United States. Here he\r\nworked at his trade as a carpenter, and had no return of any persecutory\r\ndelusions, although he still believed he was a prophet. On admission to\r\nthe insane hospital, twenty years after his arrival in the United States,\r\nhe was found to have such a decidedly asymmetrical body that suspicions of\r\ngeneral hemiatrophy were excited, but the condition was found to be\r\ncongenital. The hand and foot of the seemingly atrophic side had six\r\nfingers and toes. The man had been sent to the insane hospital in\r\nconsequence of an altercation with a neighbour who was clearly in the\r\nwrong; but both being arrested, the patient's _amour propre_ was aroused\r\nand he declared his prophetship, which led to his trial and commitment as\r\na lunatic. His wife, who applied for his discharge, was also a paranoiac.\r\nThey had had ten children, of whom three were still living at the ages of\r\nsix, eight, and ten. Two of these were six-toed and six-fingered\r\nunilaterally, and one of them, a boy, had the peculiar general asymmetry\r\nof the father. The third child was seemingly normal.\r\n\r\nThe experimental results of Charin and Gley, on the degeneration produced\r\nin offspring by ancestral microbic infection, tend to show that not merely\r\nare the extremities affected, but in certain cases the whole organism,\r\nalong lines laid down by Moreau's categories. This is demonstrated by\r\nstudy of the degeneracy stigmata of phthisical families. Alex. James,\r\nRicochon,[101] C. E. Paddock,[102] and others have shown that (in addition\r\nto the ordinary stigmata) the biologic stigmata of degeneracy (such as\r\nplural and quickly repeated births) are frequent among phthisical\r\nfamilies. The same phenomena often occur in families whose scions are\r\nattacked with diabetes, obesity, articular rheumatism, cancer and gout. De\r\nGiovanni[103] finds that particular nervous states exist in those\r\npredisposed to tuberculosis, whom he divides into erethists (restless),\r\ntorpids, and energetics. There is a diminutive heart, whose right\r\nventricle has comparatively exaggerated dimensions, while the arteries\r\nhave lessened calibre.\r\n\r\nA family illustrating excellently the transmutation of morbid heredity is\r\none followed through five generations by Kiernan.[104] A farmer lived\r\ntwenty miles distant from his nearest neighbour, whose only child he\r\nmarried. The daughter had led a lonely life till her courtship at the age\r\nof 28 by the farmer, then three years younger. The farmer married her for\r\n$300, after having impregnated her. He then found lead on his farm and\r\nwent to a city. A stock-company bought his farm and launched him into the\r\nstock market, where he made money more as a cunning tool than an\r\nadventurer. He became a high liver, gouty and dyspeptic, and died with\r\nsymptoms of gouty kidney at 70. The couple had five children. The eldest,\r\na son, became a \"Napoleon of Finance,\" but, inheriting his father's\r\ncunning, died wealthy and within the pale of the law. He married a society\r\nwoman, the last scion of an old family. The second child, a daughter, was\r\nclub-footed and early suffered from gouty tophi. She married a society man\r\nof old family who had cleft palate. The third child, a daughter, had\r\ncongenital squint. She married a man who suffered from migraine of a\r\nperiodical type. The fourth child, a daughter, was normal. She married a\r\nthirty-year-old active business man, in whom ataxia developed a year after\r\nmarriage. The fifth child, a son, was ataxic at eighteen. The children of\r\nthe \"Napoleon of Finance\" and the society woman were an imbecile son, a\r\nnymphomaniac, a hysteric, a female epileptic who had a double uterus, and\r\na son who wrote verses and was a society man. The cleft-palated society\r\nman and club-footed woman had triplets born dead and a squinting,\r\nmigrainous son who, left penniless by his parents, married his cousin the\r\nnymphomaniac daughter of the \"Napoleon of Finance,\" after being detected\r\nin an intrigue with her. The migrainous man and squinting daughter of the\r\nfarmer stockbroker had a sexually inverted masculine daughter, a daughter\r\nsubject to periodical bleeding at the nose irrespective of menstruation,\r\nas well as chorea during childhood, a normal daughter, a deaf-mute\r\nphthisical son, a daughter with cloacal formation of the perineum, an\r\nameliac son, a cyclopian daughter (with one central eye) born dead, and,\r\nfinally, a normal son. The sexual invert married the versifier son of the\r\n\"Napoleon of Finance.\" The progeny of the normal daughter of the farmer\r\nstockbroker and the ataxic husband were a dead-born, sarcomatous son, a\r\ngouty son, twin boys paralysed in infancy, twin girls normal, a normal\r\nson, and a son ataxic at fourteen. The progeny of the nymphomaniac\r\ndaughter and her strabismic, migrainous cousin were a ne'er-do-well, a\r\nperiodical lunatic, a dipsomaniac daughter who died of cancer of the\r\nstomach, deformed triplets who died at birth, an epileptic imbecile son, a\r\nhermaphrodite, a prostitute, a double monster born dead, a normal\r\ndaughter, and a paranoiac son. The ne'er-do-well married his nose-bleeding\r\ncousin. The gouty son of the farmer's normal daughter married the hysteric\r\ndaughter of the \"Napoleon of Finance.\" They had a son born with such\r\ngeneral asymmetry as to seem hemiatrophic, a prostitute, dead triplets, a\r\nmale sexual invert, a colour-blind daughter, and a normal son. The\r\ncolour-blind daughter married the paranoiac grandson of the \"Napoleon of\r\nFinance.\" The progeny of the sexual invert and the versifier, who were\r\nsoon divorced, were a daughter with periodical nymphomania, who had some\r\nartistic and literary ability, and a son who died of gastric cancer. The\r\nscions of the ne'er-do-well and his nose-bleeding cousin were a moral\r\nimbecile, a \"bleeder,\" a stammering daughter who had an uvular deformity,\r\na deaf-mute with undescended testicle, dead-born triplets, an infantile\r\nparalytic son, and dead-born quadruplets. The progeny of the paranoiac and\r\nhis colour-blind cousin were an exophthalmic daughter, an epileptic with\r\nundescended testicle, a cleft-palated imbecile with a cloaca, dead-born\r\nquadruplets, an idiot boy, and a \"bleeder.\"\r\n\r\nDoutrebente reports the following family history: First generation: Father\r\nintelligent, became melancholic, and died insane. Mother nervous and\r\nemotional. Second generation: Ten children; three died in childhood, seven\r\nreach maturity as follows: Daughter A, melancholiac; daughter B, insane at\r\ntwenty; daughter C, imbecile; daughter D, a suicide; son E, imbecile; son\r\nF, melancholic; son G, a melancholic. Third generation: A has ten\r\nchildren; five die in childhood, one is deformed, one has fits of\r\ninsanity, one is eccentric and extravagant, two are intelligent and marry,\r\nbut are childless. B leaves no issue. C has one child, a deformed\r\nimbecile. D has three children; one is an imbecile, one dies of apoplexy\r\nat twenty-three, and the third is an artist described as \"extravagant.\" E\r\nhas two children; one dies insane, the other disappears and is supposed to\r\nhave committed suicide. F is childless. G has one child, who is\r\nimbecile.[105]\r\n\r\nStrahan[106] gives a genealogy which shows very clearly the close kinship\r\nexisting between the cancerous diathesis and other forms of constitutional\r\ndegeneration whose outward manifestations are infantile convulsions,\r\nsuicide, epilepsy, insanity, lymphatism, and sterility. The father of this\r\nfamily died of stomach cancer at sixty. He had a brother who cut his\r\nthroat at fifty-six; the mother, an apparently healthy woman, died of a\r\nfit, at the age of fifty-four. To this pair seven children were born: 1. A\r\nson who died of stomach cancer at fifty-eight. 2. A son who died in\r\nconvulsions at thirteen weeks. 3, 4, and 5. Three daughters who died of\r\nphthisis, one at sixteen, the other two later in life, and after being\r\nmarried for many years; none left any issue. 6. A son who is epileptic,\r\nand has twice been confined in lunatic asylums; married, but no issue. 7.\r\nA son who is sane, and enjoying fair health. Here the taint in the mother\r\nappears to have been slight; still, it was there, and while certainly\r\npreventing reversion, it doubtless deepened the degeneration of the\r\nfather in the children. In the father's stock the taint was much deeper.\r\nWhile it was exhibited as cancer in him, it took the form of suicidal\r\nimpulse in his brother. In the children of this pair the disease of the\r\nfather is transmitted to the eldest son; but can it be denied, Strahan\r\nasks, that the infantile convulsions, the liability to tubercular disease,\r\nthe epilepsy, the insanity, and the marked sterility were but the varying\r\nevidences of the degenerate nature, inherited from a father who might have\r\ndied earlier of some acute disease, taking the secret of his nature with\r\nhim?\r\n\r\nThe value of the principle of atavism in off-setting degeneracy is nowhere\r\nbetter illustrated than in the history of famous families of degenerates\r\nlike those of the Binswangers, of \"Margaret,\" of the Jukes, as well as\r\nthose reported in France, Germany, Austria, Russia, and the Scandinavian\r\ncountries. The Rougon-Macquart family of Zola (which had its actual\r\nprototype in the Kerangal family described by Aubry[107]) had, like these,\r\nseveral scions in whom former normality regained its power through\r\natavism. Sometimes this atavism is not shown to any greater extent than a\r\nslight modification of the abnormality or morbidity.\r\n\r\nTelegony, the so-called and much-debated heredity of influence, whereby\r\nthe children of a second marriage resemble the first husband, may be\r\nexplained by a biologic principle demonstrable in the lower animals,\r\nwhereby conjugation not sufficient to fecundate ova is sufficient so to\r\nimpress them that when finally fecundated they bear characteristics of\r\nthe first conjugation. Its part in either normal or degenerate heredity\r\nis but slight. Some instances charged to it might be attributed to mental\r\nimpression on the mother.\r\n\r\nLuys[108] excellently sums up the whole question of heredity when he\r\nremarks: \"Heredity governs all the phenomena of degeneracy with the same\r\nresults and the same energy as it controls moral and physical resemblances\r\nin the offspring. The individual who comes into the world is not an\r\nisolated being separated from his kindred. He is one link in a long chain\r\nwhich is unrolled by time, and of which the first links are lost in the\r\npast. He is bound to those who follow him, and to the atavic influences\r\nwhich he possesses; he serves for their temporary resting-place, and he\r\ntransmits them to his descendants. If he come from a race well endowed and\r\nwell formed, he possesses the characters of organisation which his\r\nancestors have given him. He is ready for the combat of life, and to\r\npursue his way by his own virtues and energies. But inversely, if he\r\nspring from a stock which is already marked with an hereditary blemish,\r\nand in which the development of the nervous system is incomplete, he comes\r\ninto existence with a badly balanced organisation; and his natural\r\ndefects, existing as germs, and in a measure latent, are ready to be\r\ndeveloped when some accidental cause arises to start them into activity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCONSANGUINEOUS AND NEUROTIC INTERMARRIAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nByron has sung[109] of the old popular belief in the advantages of\r\ncross-breeding, which arose originally in the practice of exogamy\r\n(marriage outside the tribe), or, more often, outside those having the\r\nsame totem, or coat-of-arms. In all probability casual observation of\r\ndeformities after intermarriage enforced the prohibition which arose after\r\nthe killing of female children had led to exogamy. Totemic relationship\r\nwas often far from being consanguineous. The idea of incest is, as Byron's\r\nstanza denotes, of religious origin rather than innate.[110] Its criminal\r\nnature is often removed by priestly dispensation in Latin countries. From\r\nthis practice sprang the medical, theologic, and legal notions to which D.\r\nH. Tuke[111] thus refers: \"The danger arising from marriages of\r\nconsanguinity has been insisted upon from time to time by medical writers,\r\nand has been recognised by ecclesiastical authority, civil law, and by\r\npopular feeling. As regards ecclesiastical and civil law, it would be more\r\ncorrect to say that the marriage of those very nearly related has been\r\nforbidden on other grounds than that of the alleged danger to mental\r\nhealth. At the same time the justice of such laws receives support if\r\nmedical observation leads to the conclusion that consanguineous marriages\r\ntend to generate idiocy and insanity.\"\r\n\r\nThe biologic evidence from the experiments of Maupas on parthenogenesis,\r\nelsewhere cited, is seemingly supported by the results of animals breeding\r\nin-and-in. The evidence advanced against such marriages seems at first\r\nsight exceedingly strong from a biologic standpoint in man.\r\n\r\nRilliet[112] cites cases tending to show that consanguineous marriages, in\r\nthemselves pernicious, tend with certainty to lower vital force. The\r\neffects he divides into two categories; those which relate to the\r\nparents, under which head are:--\r\n\r\n    _a._ Failure of conception.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Retardation of conception.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Imperfect conception.\r\n\r\nThose which relate to the progeny:--\r\n\r\n    _a._ Imperfections of various kinds.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Monstrosities.\r\n\r\n    _c._ Imperfect physical and mental organisation.\r\n\r\n    _d._ Tendency to diseases of the nervous system, such as epilepsy,\r\n    imbecility, idiocy, deaf-mutism, paralysis, and various cerebral\r\n    affections.\r\n\r\n    _e._ Tendency to strumous diseases.\r\n\r\n    _f._ Tending to die young.\r\n\r\n    _g._ Tendency to succumb to disease which others would easily resist.\r\n\r\nC. H. S. Davis,[113] of Meriden, Connecticut, states that intermarriages\r\nin families lead to a degeneration that manifests itself in deaf-mutism,\r\nalbinism, and idiocy. Isaac Ray[114] is of the opinion that consanguineous\r\nmarriages repeated through successive generations account for the numerous\r\ninstances of insanity and idiocy occurring in quiet rural populations of\r\nNew England, far from the excitements of city life, which are generally\r\nsupposed to be more productive of mental unsoundness.\r\n\r\nS. M. Bemiss,[115] of New Orleans, Louisiana, giving a report of the\r\ncondition of the offspring of 580 intermarriages of first cousins,\r\ngathered mostly by medical men from nearly every State in the Union, says:\r\n2,778 children were born of these cousins, of whom 793 were defective, 117\r\ndeaf and dumb, 63 blind, 231 idiotic, 24 insane, 44 epileptic, 189\r\nscrofulous, 53 deformed, and 637 died early.\r\n\r\nWhile these figures seem very demonstrative, they contain a great many\r\nelements of error. One of these is incidentally pointed out by Arthur\r\nMitchell,[116] who finds that under favourable conditions of life the\r\napparent ill effects of consanguineous marriages are frequently almost\r\nnil, whilst if the children are ill-fed, badly housed and clothed, the\r\nevil may become very marked. He calculates that the percentage of\r\nconsanguineous marriages generally in Scotland is 1.3, or ten times less\r\nthan with the parents of idiots. Taking his figures a strong case seems to\r\nbe made out in support of the opinion that idiocy, among other evils,\r\nresults from intermarriage. Langdon Down, although his figures are not of\r\nso unfavourable a character, admits consanguinity as one of the causes of\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nGeorge H. Darwin concluded from a careful investigation that about 4 per\r\ncent. of all marriages in England are between first cousins, and between 2\r\nand 3 per cent. in the smaller towns and in the country; with these he\r\ncompared the rate of similar marriages among the parents of lunatics and\r\nidiots in asylums, and found it to be about 3 or 4 per cent.--not higher,\r\ntherefore, than in the general population.\r\n\r\nHuth[117] cites instances occurring regularly at the present day among\r\ncertain isolated communities (St. Kilda, Pitcairn, and Iceland) without\r\napparent evil consequences to the race. Such marriages were common among\r\nthe North American Indians and the South Sea Islanders, people among whom\r\nidiocy and other degenerate hereditary conditions were remarkably rare.\r\nThese cases, Strahan remarks, deal with peculiarly healthy communities.\r\nTherein lies the secret of such intermarriage proving innocent of evil to\r\nthe offspring. Were such intermarriage common among the degenerates the\r\nresult would be disastrous.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the New York State Medical Society[118] appointed a committee to\r\ninvestigate the influence of consanguineous marriages upon the offspring.\r\nTheir results show clearly that if the family be free from degenerate\r\ntaint, marriage among its members in no way diminishes the chances of\r\nhealthy offspring. This conclusion is in accord with the findings of\r\nrecent investigators like Anstie, George Darwin, and A. H. Huth, according\r\nto whom there is no greater amount of morbidity or abnormality among the\r\noffspring of consanguineous parents than among the children of parents not\r\nso related, provided the parents be equally free from tendency to disease\r\nor degeneration. With a perfectly healthy stock, as every breeder of\r\nanimals knows, remarks Strahan,[119] \"in-and-in breeding\" may be practised\r\nwith impunity, but where the stock is tainted with disease or\r\nimperfection, safety is only to be found in \"crossing.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the error lay in the old doctrine, upon which was founded the\r\nprohibition of consanguineous unions, was not, as Strahan remarks, in\r\nasserting that disease and deformity were more often met with in children\r\nof these than in those of other unions, for such is true, but attributing\r\nthese unhappy results to the mere fact that the parents were related by\r\nblood. Over and above the fact that these consanguineous marriages are\r\nalmost certain to transmit in an accentuated form any defect or tendency\r\nto disease already present in the family, there is no physiological reason\r\nwhy such marriages should not take place. Breeders of prize stock\r\nfrequently breed \"in and in,\" not only with impunity, but with marked\r\nbenefit. But this fact, while going to prove that it is not the mere blood\r\nrelationship of the parents which induces the degeneration so often found\r\nin the children of consanguineous marriages, can but rarely be advanced as\r\nan argument in support of the marriage of blood relations. The\r\nstock-raiser only permits the more perfect members of his flocks and herds\r\nto continue their kind, and for this reason the \"in-and-in\" breeding is\r\ninnocuous, just as it would be in the human family under like conditions.\r\nBut where shall we find the perfect human family? Such families are\r\ncertainly rare. The laws of natural life have been so strained and\r\nperverted that almost every family nowadays has a taint or twist of some\r\nkind, and as all such imperfections are transmitted and rapidly deepened\r\nand fixed in the family by the intermarriage of its members, it is best\r\nthat such unions should be forbidden.\r\n\r\nRecently acquired characters, whether physiologic or pathologic, are very\r\nliable to disappear when the individual bearing such characters\r\nintermarries with another not having the same character. The natural\r\ntendency in all such cases is to revert in the offspring to the normal or\r\nhealthy type, so that unless the new character be very deeply impressed\r\nupon the parental organism it is almost certain it will not appear in the\r\noffspring, if the other parents have nothing of the character. But when\r\nboth parents are possessed of the character, whether it be physiologic or\r\npathologic, this natural tendency to revert to the original is often\r\noverborne and the character is repeated in an accentuated form in the\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\nNow this accentuation of all family characters is what must always happen\r\nin the case of consanguineous marriages. If there be any taint in the\r\nfamily each member of the family will have inherited more or less of it\r\nfrom the common ancestor. Take the case of cousins, the descendants of a\r\ncommon grandparent who was insane and of an insane stock. Here the cousins\r\nare certain to have inherited more or less of the insane diathesis. Even\r\nif the taint has been largely diluted in their case by the wise, or, more\r\nlikely, fortunate marriages of their blood-related parents, yet will they\r\nhave inherited a certain tendency to nervous disease, and if they marry\r\nthey must not be surprised if that taint appears in an aggravated form in\r\ntheir children. Some of the children of such parents are generally\r\nidiotic, epileptic, dumb, or lymphatic, and the parents marvel whence came\r\nthe imperfection. It may be in some cases that the parents, and possibly\r\nthe grandparent, of the unfortunate children, have not up till that time\r\ndisplayed any outward evidence of the tendency to disease which they have\r\ninherited and handed on to their descendants; and, not looking farther\r\nback, the parents boldly assert that such a thing as insanity, epilepsy,\r\nscrofula, &c., is unknown to their family. They themselves have never been\r\ninsane; why, then, should their children? In like manner children may be\r\nepileptic, blind, deaf-mute, lymphatic, cancerous, criminal, drunkards, or\r\ndeformed from direct inheritance, and yet the family line be honestly\r\ndeclared to be healthy. Hence the truth of Sir William Aitken's maxim,\r\nthat \"a family history including less than three generations is useless\r\nand may even be misleading.\" From the foregoing it is evident that the\r\nsimilarity of temperament induced by a common environment, and which\r\nStrahan would call \"social consanguinity,\" must be a potent factor in the\r\nproduction of all hereditary degenerations. Living under similar customs,\r\nhabits and surroundings, labouring at the same occupation, indulging in\r\nthe same dissipation, tend to engender like diseases and degenerations,\r\nirrespective of any blood relationship. Hence it not seldom happens that\r\npersons not even distantly related by blood are, in reality, much more\r\nnearly related in temperament than cousins, or even nearer blood relations\r\nwho have experienced widely different modes of life. This \"social\r\nconsanguinity\" is the great curse which dogs every exclusive tribe and\r\nclass, and hurries them to extinction. It has largely aided real or family\r\nconsanguinity in the production of the diseases and degenerations which\r\nhave so heavily fallen upon the aristocracies and royal families of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nA crucial test of the opposing positions taken respectively in such a\r\npositive manner by Bemiss and Strahan would be a family intermarrying\r\nextensively, but placed under favouring conditions unlikely of themselves\r\nto create degeneracy. Excellent cases of this kind are furnished by\r\nBourgeois[120] and Thiebault.[121] Bourgeois gives the history of his own\r\nfamily, which was the issue of a union of the third degree of\r\nconsanguinity. During the ensuing 160 years there were ninety-one\r\nmarriages, of which sixteen were consanguineous. All of these latter were\r\nproductive. There was not a single case of malformation, or other physical\r\nor mental disease in the offspring.\r\n\r\nThiebault reports the case of a slave-dealer who died in the year 1849 at\r\nWhidah, Dahomey, leaving behind him four hundred disconsolate widows, and\r\nabout one hundred children. By the order of the king the whole family were\r\ninterned in a particular district, where reigned the most complete\r\npromiscuity. In 1863 there were children of the third generation.\r\nThiebault, after verifying these facts, states that at that time, although\r\nthese people were born from all degrees of incestuous unions, there was\r\nnot a single instance of deaf-mutism, albinism, blindness, cretinism, or\r\nother congenital malformation. From these cases it is evident that the\r\nposition of Strahan is not too strongly taken.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that \"like clings to like,\" still this does not imply\r\nkinship, but it very often implies likeness in mental characteristics.\r\nThis tendency has been shown to be present in the neurotic by Roller,[122]\r\nDe Monteyel,[123] Kiernan,[124] Bannister,[125] and Manning,[126] so far\r\nas Germany, France, the United States, and Australia are concerned.\r\nBannister puts the statistical proof of this tendency very forcibly as\r\nfollows: \"There are in Illinois, according to the most recent estimates,\r\nin round numbers, about 6,000 insane, or one to a little over 500 of the\r\npopulation. Even if we double, treble, or quadruple this frequency to\r\ninclude all that have been or are to be insane, as well as those insane at\r\nthe present time, it would not appear that there was much probability of\r\ntwo insane persons being married according to any ordinary law of chances.\r\nIn fact, we find four out of the 104 with insane heredity had both father\r\nand mother insane. In one of these cases the insane heredity involved both\r\nparents and both grandparents on each side, though in the case of the\r\nlatter the histories show it only as collateral. Besides these, three\r\npatients had direct paternal and collateral maternal heredity; two had\r\ndirect maternal and collateral paternal heredity, and in one case there\r\nwas collateral heredity of insanity on both sides. This makes altogether\r\nnearly 10 per cent. of those with insane heredity with it on both sides,\r\nmaternal and paternal, and thus favoured with a double opportunity to\r\ninherit mental disease. If we add to this the instances where, with\r\ninsanity of one parent, there is reported either epilepsy, hysteria, or\r\ndrunkenness, 'brain disease,' nervousness, &c., of the other, the ratio of\r\ndouble inheritance rises to over 20 per cent.\"\r\n\r\nThe beneficial effects which may result from atavism are, it will be\r\nobvious, offset by this tendency of the neurotic to intermarry, thus\r\nperverting the principle of atavism to the assistance of degeneracy.\r\n\r\nThe age of the parent plays a part in degeneracy. Conger[127] (whose\r\nresults have been corroborated by Joseph Workman, of Toronto, and\r\nKiernan,[128] of Chicago) points out that in all degenerative forms we\r\nmust take into consideration this factor, since it determines the\r\ndevelopment of degeneracy in childhood. Hereditary taint may be\r\ntransmitted to descendants as a simple neuropathy, as a neurosis, or as a\r\ndefect of development reaching even to idiocy. Conger finds the prevailing\r\nage, especially the age of the mothers of degenerates, is often between\r\ntwenty and twenty-five years, and that hence there exists a relation\r\nbetween this age and the greater transmission of degeneracy to the\r\noffspring. Marro, who has specially investigated the influence of the age\r\nof the parents, both in the normal population and among criminals,[129]\r\nfinds that among all classes of criminals there is an excess of immature\r\nparents (under 26) or senile parents (over 40), and that only petty\r\noffenders possessed a normal number of mature parents (26 to 40 years). A\r\nman between 20 and 25 is in as favourable condition for procreating\r\ndegenerates as the very aged. Because of incompleted organic development\r\nhe has been unable to free himself from hereditary taint which he\r\ntransmits to his descendants, but which in maturer age, through the\r\ninfluence of adaptation, evolution, or education, might perhaps be more or\r\nless notably modified.\r\n\r\nThe organism between 20 and 25 is yet incomplete; education has not been\r\nable to exert much influence in determining those possible changes which\r\nare adapted to modify congenital tendencies. In a word, the individual\r\nbetween 20 and 25 feels too much the influence of atavic characters, and\r\ntoo readily transmits to his posterity the brands of degeneracy.\r\nExperience has made it well known that the children of the aged readily\r\nshow degenerate types. Many children of old fathers have undoubtedly\r\ninherited all the characters of the weakness of the age in which they were\r\nbegotten. Old age represents the period of retrogression, of involution,\r\nand hence readily transmits the mark of degeneracy. The children of either\r\ntoo young or too old parents, failing to escape hereditary predisposition,\r\nmay from birth inherit those characters which are proper to incomplete\r\norganic development or to the period of involution.\r\n\r\nKiernan has had under observation a Nova Scotian family of Scotch\r\nextraction, the mother of which continued to bear children until she was\r\n63 years old. There had been no pregnancy between 50 and 56. At 56 a son\r\nwas born who had ear, jaw and skull stigmata, and became a periodical\r\nlunatic at 25. A son, born a year after, was a six-fingered idiot, with\r\nretinitis pigmentosa. (These last expressions of degeneracy are, as\r\nDarier[130] has shown, often associated. Darier's cases had the following\r\nhereditary antecedents: One father had hemeralopia; one mother had\r\ndefective vision; a grandfather was blind at 30; a grandfather was blind\r\nin one eye, and an uncle had congenital iris coloboma. Only one patient\r\nexamined did not have hemeralopic descendants. Six patients examined\r\nbelonged to five different families, all consisting of five or six\r\nchildren, one-third of whom had hemeralopia. Among thirty-five children\r\nthere were eleven hemeralopes and two six-fingered children, who died too\r\nyoung to determine the existence of retinitis pigmentosa. The disease in\r\nall began in childhood, and hemeralopia was absent in but one case.) Three\r\nof the next children (two boys and a girl) became paralytic idiots in\r\ninfancy. Here the degeneracy was expressed in that tendency to miliary\r\naneurismal weakness of arteries to which E. C. Spitzka,[131] called\r\nattention over a decade ago. One of the next children was a periodically\r\nsexual invert female. The last child was an epileptic. The children born\r\nbefore the age of fifty were normal and averaged 60 years of age.\r\n\r\nMatthews Duncan,[132] Arthur Mitchell, and Langdon Down, have called\r\nattention to the influence of premature and late marriage in the\r\nproduction of idiocy. Factors capable of producing idiocy are of course\r\ncapable of producing less decided expressions of degeneracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nINTERMIXTURE OF RACES\r\n\r\n\r\nDefoe, in his _Trueborn Englishman_, outlines a factor of great importance\r\nin degeneracy.[133] Race intermixture is much more common than is\r\ngenerally believed, owing to that ethnologic error consequent on the\r\ndiscovery of Sanscrit, which tests race by speech. Keane[134] excellently\r\nexplodes this error by the following table:\r\n\r\n  Peoples.            Race.                    Speech.\r\n\r\n  English             Kelto-Teutonic           Teutonic\r\n  Scotch              Kelto-Teutonic           Teutonic\r\n  Cornish             Siluro-Kelto-Teutonic    Teutonic\r\n  Irish (West)        Siluro-Kelto-Teutonic    Keltic\r\n  Welsh               Siluro-Kelto-Teutonic    Keltic\r\n  French              Ibero-Kelto-Teutonic     Italic\r\n  Spanish             Ibero-Keltic             Italic\r\n  Germans             Slavo-Kelto-Teutonic     Teutonic\r\n  Bohemians           Kelto-Teuto-Slavonic     Slavonic\r\n  Russians (many)     Finno-Slavonic           Slavonic\r\n  Hungarians          Ugro-Slavonic            Slavonic\r\n  Bulgarians          Ugro-Teuto-Slavonic      Finnic\r\n  Prussians (East)    Letto-Teuto-Slavonic     Teutonic\r\n  Rumanians           Italo-Slavo-Illyric      Italic\r\n  Italians            Liguro-Kelto-Italic      Italic\r\n\r\nProfoundly mixed as this table indicates European races to be, it is far\r\nfrom representing the full extent of race mingling. The primitive worship\r\nof the Slavonic Czernebog by the Saxons in England demonstrates a Slavonic\r\nstrain, derivable, as Kiernan[135] remarks, from their contact with the\r\nWends of the Baltic. Not merely are the Aryan races of Europe mixed\r\ntogether, but the blood of all has a pre-Aryan and a Turanian dash. In\r\nGreat Britain, as Taylor[136] and others have shown, the Iberian type is\r\nfound in Wales and Scotland as well as elsewhere, though in lesser degree.\r\nThese admixtures date back to palaeolithic times when, although, as Keane\r\nremarks, the predominant type of skull was dolicocephalic (or\r\nlong-headed), the brachycephalic (or round-headed type) had begun to\r\nappear in America, then connected by land with both Africa and Europe. In\r\nthe subsequent neolithic time, while the type is at first generally\r\nbrachycephalic, it soon becomes mesatocephalic (mixed long and\r\nround-headed), pure brachycephals and dolicocephals becoming rare. Vogt\r\nwent so far as to maintain that were the three chief anthropoid apes\r\ndeveloped further, two dolicocephalic and one brachycephalic type of man\r\nwould result; the first two from the chimpanzee and gorilla, the last from\r\nthe orang. The orang descendant would have long arms and red hair. The\r\nchimpanzee descendant would be of small size, dark colour with slender\r\nbones and jaws. The gorilla race would have massive chest, big bones,\r\nmassive jaws and teeth. These three types appear in Great Britain and\r\nIreland and traces of their blood are still detectable in living men. Sir\r\nWalter Scott draws an excellent picture of the \"orang\" type in _Rob Roy_,\r\nwhose hero, according to reliable tradition, represented the Pict type.\r\nGomme[137] has lately shown that these races persisted long enough to\r\nstamp their savage beliefs on coming races and intermingled with them. The\r\nNeolithic race in Great Britain was dark, of feeble build, short stature,\r\nwith dolicocephalic skulls. This race remained to the historic period, as\r\nthe Silures in Great Britain and the Firbolgs in Ireland. It had high\r\ncheek-bones and oblique eyes, as Kiernan[138] points out. Towards the\r\nmiddle of the neolithic period this race was conquered by a\r\nbrachycephalic, tall, long-armed, muscular race, with florid complexion\r\nand yellowish or red hair.[139] Scott's _Rob Roy_ is an example of this\r\ntype. A third race of fair complexion with prognathous face,\r\ndolicocephalic skulls, of tall stature, great bones, great chest\r\ndevelopment and massive jaws, later invaded Great Britain. While these\r\nraces resemble Vogt's hypothetical descendants of the anthropoid apes, it\r\nshould be stated that there is not the slightest evidence for this line of\r\ndescent. Writers who ignore these race characteristics have often brought\r\nserious criticism and even discredit on the doctrine of degeneracy.\r\nLombroso, starting from the correct premise, that wide departure from the\r\nrace type is evidence of degeneracy, erroneously cites in illustration\r\nVirchow's departure from the German type, Byron's departure from the\r\nEnglish type, O'Connell's dolicocephalic departure from the\r\nmesatocephalic Irish type, and Robert Bruce's neanderthaloid departure\r\nfrom the Scandinavian type. As Kiernan has shown,[140] Virchow, as his\r\nname denotes, is a German-speaking Slavonic Wend; Byron was a\r\nCelto-Scandinavian Scotchman; O'Connell was born in a district conquered\r\nby the tall dolicocephalic race which invaded Ireland. The Bruce type of\r\nskull is still found among the purer Norwegians, Frisians, Swedes, and\r\nDanes, and was common just before his day and just after, as has been\r\nshown by Taylor.\r\n\r\nAs the intermingling of races began early, the question of the existence\r\nof pure races to-day, or even during the historic period, is an open one.\r\nThe Hebrews have been comparatively pure since the return from the\r\nCaptivity. Before that, as the history of Solomon's foreign marriages\r\ndemonstrates, they were a raceless chaos, the Semitic element\r\npredominating. Researches by Flinders Petrie[141] and others show that the\r\nEgyptians were a mixture of Turanians, Hamites, Aryan and Semite peoples\r\nimposed on a negroid basis. When these elements were finally fused, the\r\nrace bred relatively true, although the lower classes tend to the negroid\r\ntype and the higher to the Caucasic.\r\n\r\nThe Koreans, as Keane remarks, are a mixture of two primitive races, one\r\nwhite and one yellow. The Japanese, whose ancestors emigrated to Japan\r\nfrom Korea are, according to Topinard,[142] the product of the addition of\r\nthree distinct types to that forming their Korean ancestors. The Caucasic\r\nto a small extent, the Polynesian to a greater, and the Malay to a still\r\ngreater, are mixed with the original Korean.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese are neither a homogeneous people nor a pure race, albeit the\r\nrelatively few Mantchus are dominant. The Aryan of India, on whom Max\r\nMueller laid such stress, is known to be, despite a rigid caste system, a\r\nnon-Aryan race, feebly infused with a modicum of Aryan blood. The\r\nso-called \"Gypsy\" seems, of all the races of India, to have retained most\r\nAryan speech and type as well as its original semi-nomadic\r\nwaggon-journeying tendencies in the midst of settled civilisation. Ghetto\r\nseclusion long helped to preserve relative purity of race in the Jew, but\r\ndespite vagabond surroundings the \"Gypsy\" has remained even purer.\r\n\r\nGreat as has been the mixture of even widely separated types like the\r\nthree races described as mingling in Great Britain and Ireland, even\r\ngreater admixture occurred in comparatively late historic times. The\r\nso-called Scotch-Irish (whose blood enters so largely into the dominant\r\nrace of the United States) are, despite their speech (much more Teutonic\r\nand monosyllabic than English), as Kiernan[143] has shown, a raceless\r\nchaos of Gaelic and Cymric Celts, Lowland Scotch, French Huguenots, Danes\r\n(Celto-Teuto-Slaves),[144] Palatinate Germans, Magyars, English Puritans,\r\nHollanders, Swedes, Protestant Italians, Poles, and Spaniards. The\r\nintermixture of the dark, small-boned, dolichocephalic, orthognathous\r\n(with in-drawn jaws) race first with the brachycephalic, prognathous,\r\nbig-boned, red-haired race, and then with the dolichocephalic prognathous,\r\ndeep-chested, big-boned, fair race, must have produced in the British\r\nIsles as marked variations in type as now occur from the admixture of the\r\nIndian and negro. These are especially noticeable in the Marshpee Indians\r\nof Cape Cod, the Long Island tribes and the \"Red Bones\" of South Carolina.\r\nThe Marshpee tribe is an admixture of Anglo-Saxon, Portuguese, Indian, and\r\nnegro. The Indian element, while still demonstrable, is lessening. Some of\r\nthe older people still retain Indian characteristics. A girl of ten was\r\nnegro in all respects except her hair. An adult whose mother was half\r\nwhite, half Marshpee, while the father is negro, had all the negro\r\ncharacteristics except the skin, which was Indian in type, and the jaws,\r\nwhich were slender. Another adult who had a negro great-grandfather,\r\nMarshpee mother, and a three-fourths Marshpee father, had large,\r\nnegro-like jaws, Indian hair, skin, and cheek-bones. Another adult had a\r\nPortuguese maternal grandmother, negro grandfather, an Indian-white\r\npaternal grandmother and Indian-negro paternal grandfather. His hair,\r\njaws, and nose were negro, his cheek-bones were high, his upper and lower\r\njaws met so that the front teeth occluded.[145] The like condition obtains\r\nin the Long Island Indians, but to a less extent with the \"Red Bones,\"\r\nwho, after the type was formed, avoided admixture with the negro.\r\n\r\nThe influence of race intermixture in the production of degeneracy is\r\neasily settled. Basing their opinion on the notorious sterility of the\r\nhybrid offspring of the horse and ass, certain biologists have assumed\r\nlike results in man and have cited the alleged absence of Australian\r\nhalf-breeds in evidence. Since the hare and rabbit, dog and wolf, sheep\r\nand goat produce breeds intermediate between the parents, fertile while\r\nenvironment is unchanged, horse and ass sterility cannot be accepted as of\r\nmuch value in settling the question. Recent researches have shown that the\r\nhalf-breeds which survived birth among the Australians were killed in\r\naccordance with tribal usages regulating population in accordance with\r\nfood supply.\r\n\r\nWhether the results of race intermixture prove degenerate or not will turn\r\nlargely on the environment. The mulatto is certainly better adapted to the\r\nwhite environment than the pure negro, albeit less so than the white. That\r\nrace intermixture may, however, determine degeneration, is shown by the\r\nrelapse into voodooism and cannibalism of the Haiti and Louisiana French\r\nhybrids, and the Anglo-Saxon hybrids of Liberia, who contrast\r\ndisadvantageously with the Arabianised Moslem Mandingoes and Veys, which\r\nlast have advanced so far as to devise a system of writing. The extent of\r\nthe influence of environment is shown in the career of the Dumas family,\r\nwhich is of Haitian-negro origin. The grandfather was a general in the\r\nFrench army, the father and son were two stars in the literary firmament.\r\nThe sculptor, Edmonia Lewis, was of similar stock to these. Evidences of\r\ndegeneracy were rare among the Marshpee Indians, as I have elsewhere\r\nshown.[146]\r\n\r\nThe Abyssinians have preserved that antique type of Christianity which had\r\nJewish usages; they had their own literature, alphabet, and old type of\r\ncivilisation. According to Keane, the present inhabitants of Abyssinia\r\nform an extremely complex ethnical group in which it is not always\r\npossible to distinguish the constituent elements. The prevailing colour\r\nis a distinct brown, shading northwards to a light, olive, fair\r\ncomplexion, southwards to a deep chocolate and an almost sooty black.\r\nThere are Abyssinians who may certainly be called black, and in whom the\r\nnegro strain is revealed in the somewhat tumid lip, small nose, broad at\r\nbase, and frizzly, black hair. But the majority may be described as a\r\nmixed Hamito-Semitic people, who, beyond question, belong fundamentally to\r\nthe Caucasic division. While the Hamitic, Semitic, and the Latin branch of\r\nthe Aryans are admitted to form a fertile, progressive admixture with the\r\nnegro, the reverse is commonly assumed to be the case with the English\r\nspeaking Celto-Teutons. Daniel Wilson[147] is of opinion that this is not\r\ntrue as to millions of the coloured race who now constitute the indigenous\r\npopulation of the Southern States. They are at home there in a climate to\r\nwhich the white race adapts itself with very partial success. The\r\noffspring of white fathers and of mothers of the African races, they have\r\nmultiplied to millions; and now, with the recently acquired rights of\r\ncitizenship, and with the advantage of education within their reach, the\r\ncountry is their town. The very social prejudices against miscegenation\r\nprotect them from the effacing influence to which the Indian half-breed is\r\nexposed, by ever-recurrent intermarriage with the dominant race. As yet\r\nthere are discernible the various degrees of heredity from the mulatto to\r\nthe quinteron. But the abolition of slavery has placed the coloured race\r\non an entirely new footing. Left as it now is, free to enjoy the\r\nhealthful, social relations of a civilised community, and protected, by\r\nthe very prejudices of race and caste, from any large intermixture with\r\nthe white race, it can scarcely admit of doubt that there will survive on\r\nthe American Continent a Melanochroi of its own, more distinctly separated\r\nfrom the white race, not only by heredity but also by climate influences,\r\nthan the \"dark Whites\" of Europe are from the blonde types of Hellenic,\r\nSlavic, Teutonic, or Scandinavian stock. This condition will be modified\r\nby the fact that the negro American, like the others, is a traveller and,\r\nwith a rise of culture, tends to city life.\r\n\r\nThe admixture with the white has reduced negro prognathism and\r\ndolichocephaly. It must, however, be admitted that these reductions had\r\nalready been begun in Africa. Sir H. H. Johnston, however, fully agrees\r\nwith the negro writer[148] who holds that the \"pure and unadulterated\r\nNegro cannot, as a rule, advance with any certainty of stability above his\r\npresent level of culture; that he requires the admixture of a superior\r\ntype of man.\" But the white and black races are \"too widely separated in\r\ntype to produce a satisfactory hybrid\"; hence Johnston thinks that, \"the\r\nadmixture of yellow that the Negro requires should come from India, and\r\nthat Western Africa and British Central Africa should become the America\r\nof the Hindu. The mixture of the two races would give the Indian the\r\nphysical development which he lacks, and he, in his turn, would transmit\r\nto his half Negro offspring the industry, ambition, and aspiration toward\r\na civilised life which the Negro so markedly lacks.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, race intermixture will not tend to elevate the race where\r\nthere is a decided difference in the state of evolution of the two races,\r\nand moreover especially where, as is usually the case, the mother is of\r\nthe inferior race. It must be obvious that, given a negro pelvis and the\r\nhead of a white, results damaging to the offspring cannot but occur. And\r\nthese results are of a nature likely to be transmitted by heredity. The\r\nsame would hold true with other races as well. Although the differences\r\nbetween the Hawaiian and the white are much less than those between the\r\nnegro and the white, it is notorious that while the labours with pure\r\nHawaiians are easy, those with half-whites are difficult. The same\r\nconditions have been observed from time to time between different breeds\r\nof dogs, whose pelves vary. Therefore it is safe to assume that admixtures\r\nof races of different grades of evolution will, if carried to any great\r\nextent, tend to render the superior race more liable to the action of the\r\nfactors producing degeneracy. Dixon[149] has shown that mulatto families\r\ntend to disappear, if they be not crossed with either black or white, and\r\nthat the limit of descent is the fourth generation. He has also pointed\r\nout that morbid proclivities and retrogressive tendencies are peculiarly\r\nrife among mulattoes. The fact, long ago shown by Menatta,[150] that the\r\nconflict for existence between brain growth and reproductive organ growth\r\nat puberty, results, in the mulatto, as in the negro and anthropoids, in\r\nthe triumph of the reproductive, indicates that the mulatto has factors of\r\ndegeneracy which would be fatal to the establishment of an intermediate\r\ntype on the environment of the white. While Menatta is in error in\r\nregarding skull mal-development as the cause, when it and brain growth\r\ndisturbance are defects due to the same cause, still general observation\r\nsupports his opinion that \"negro children are sharp, intelligent, and full\r\nof vivacity, but on approaching the adult period a gradual change sets in.\r\nThe intellect seems to become clouded, animation giving place to a sort of\r\nlethargy, briskness yielding to indolence. We must necessarily infer that\r\nthe development of the negro and white proceeds on different lines. While\r\nwith the latter the volume of brain grows with the expansion of the brain\r\npan, in the former the growth of the brain is, on the contrary, arrested\r\nby the premature closing of the cranial sutures and laternal pressure of\r\nthe frontal bone.\" Since, as Havelock Ellis remarks,[151] even the highest\r\nraces do not fulfil the promise of evolution they make before puberty,\r\nanything which tends still further to impede the fulfilment must be\r\nregarded as a factor of degeneracy. Hence intermixture with an inferior\r\nrace, having an inferior type of pelvis, would tend to degeneracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTOXIC AGENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe toxic agents which influence the race toward degeneracy, exert that\r\ndeterioration in a mode which closely resembles that of the degenerative\r\npowers of the acute and chronic contagions and infections. The acute\r\npoisonings by these toxic agencies resemble the acute, nervous and other\r\nexhaustion caused by the toxin of the germs underlying the infections and\r\ncontagions. The chronic conditions due to these toxic agents agree in many\r\nrespects with the chronic states produced by the infections and\r\ncontagions. The toxic agencies are divisible into those belonging to the\r\ncondiments, medicines, foods and beverages, and those arising from\r\noccupations.\r\n\r\nTobacco is the most common, while alcohol and opium contend for second\r\nplace both as to use and as to deleterious effects. Alcohol has been\r\nrepeatedly charged with being _the_ factor in degeneracy. Statistics of\r\nthe first half of the present century seem to justify the conclusion that\r\nit is apparently the most potent factor, yet these statistics as a rule\r\nconfound coincidence and cause, or effect and cause, or the vicious\r\ncircles thereby resulting, to a remarkable degree. There are but few\r\nraces in which alcohol has not been used and abused. The American\r\nIndians[152] had tizwein, chica, and pulque long ere Columbus; the Tartars\r\nand Russians, bouza, kvas, and kumyss; the South Sea Islanders ava and\r\ntoddy (from the cocoanut); the Tunisians, laymi. The vast majority of the\r\nraces of mankind have used alcoholic beverages. Each was called by a local\r\nname and not by a loan word, a most demonstrable evidence of local origin.\r\n\r\nEven the social insects (bees and ants) at times indulge in fruit\r\nferments. The claim, therefore, that alcohol is the product of high\r\ncivilisation, hence of recent origin, and hence peculiarly destructive, is\r\nuntenable. That excess in alcohol frequently occurs in degenerate stocks\r\nis, however, undeniable. But as Krafft-Ebing, Kiernan, Spitzka and others\r\nhave shown, intolerance of alcohol is an expression of degeneracy. The\r\nperson intolerant of alcohol becomes either a total abstainer because of a\r\npersonal idiosyncrasy (like that which forbids certain people to eat\r\nshell-fish lest nettle-rash occur), or because of parsimony, or for both\r\nreasons combined. Such total abstainers leave degenerate offspring in\r\nwhich degeneracy assumes the type of excess in alcohol as well as even\r\nlower phases. The race tests of the deteriorating influence of alcohol are\r\npractically valueless, nor are statistics concerning alcoholism in the\r\nancestry of degenerates of much more use. The enormous amount of idiocy,\r\nfor example, in the Scandinavian countries, charged by Huss, Langdon Down\r\nand others to alcoholism in the parents, has been, by the most recent\r\nresearches, cut down by Roof to less than 7 per cent. Insane hospital\r\nstatistics vary to a like degree. Bad faith, however, is out of the\r\nquestion in these statistics. Lack of analytic skill, and that dangerous\r\nunscientific, canting, philanthropic tendency which rebels at statistics\r\nunfavourable to preconceived sociologic theories, explain these\r\ndiscrepancies. The ignoring of all but the alcoholic factor produces also\r\ngreat elements of error. Kiernan[153] cites twenty-three cases in which\r\ndegenerate stocks were charged to alcoholic parentage, but which on\r\nanalysis proved to be due to a degenerative factor in the parents of which\r\nalcoholism was merely an expression. Nearly all the offspring born after\r\ninebriety were prematurely born, defective, epileptic, hysteric, insane,\r\nidiots or criminals. Some few were healthy, apart from their intolerance\r\nof alcohol. In eighteen cases both father and mother were alcoholists. The\r\nfathers in four of these cases had been temperate, industrious, and\r\naffectionate ere being sunstruck. Following this came periods of\r\nirritability, excessive drinking and spendthriftiness. The mothers had\r\nremained for some years after the fathers' breakdown free from the use of\r\nalcohol, but were nervously exhausted from the strain. One became\r\ndepressed during pregnancy, was given gin for the depression, and the\r\nhabit persisted after the delivery. In the three other cases painful\r\nmenses developed during the nervous exhaustion. The popular prescription\r\nfor these, gin, was given, with the result of producing inebriety. In ten\r\ncases skull injury to the father had like results on both mother and\r\nfather. In two cases the mother became a victim of painful menstruation\r\nafter a railroad accident; gin drinking, to relieve this, followed and\r\nbecame a habit. The father's nervous system broke down under the strain\r\nand both became inebriates. In two other cases nervous exhaustion from\r\ntyphoid and typhus fever produced the same outcome in inebriety on the\r\npart of the father and mother. In the remaining cases the inebriety was an\r\nexpression of nerve exhaustion after various protracted infections. The\r\nalcoholism in these cases was clearly an expression of the factors of race\r\ndeterioration producing degeneracy, and not its cause.\r\n\r\nThe influence of alcohol must therefore first be studied on the individual\r\nto determine its value and method of action as a cause of race\r\ndeterioration. Careful medical researches have shown that alcohol produces\r\na nervous state, closely resembling that induced by the contagions and\r\ninfections, often accompanied with mental disturbance (delirium tremens\r\nand acute types of insanity). The acute nervous state to which the term\r\nalcoholism was applied by Magnus Huss has all the essential\r\ncharacteristics of the nervous state due to the contagions and infections.\r\nThere is, however, a greater tendency to impotence and sterility in the\r\nalcohol nervous state than in the others, and consequently a lesser\r\ninfluence on race deterioration. The condition, moreover, has a tendency\r\nto set into action degenerative tendencies latent in the liver and\r\nkidneys. This action of alcohol on the liver and kidneys so interferes\r\nwith their functions as to produce the effect already described as\r\nresulting in the contagions and infections from their toxins. Alcohol\r\nexerts a similarly deteriorating influence on the antitoxin-forming\r\norgans (especially on the testicles, ovaries and their appendages), to\r\nthat already described as exerted by the toxins of the contagions and\r\ninfections. To the direct toxic effects of alcohol are therefore added\r\nresults of imperfect liver and kidney action and defective strengthening\r\npowers from deficient antitoxin secretion. Like all toxic agents, alcohol\r\ninterferes with the functions of the eye and ear nerves. Special weakness\r\nthus created is transmissible to the offspring. The chronic type of\r\nalcoholism may well be compared in its effect with chronic contagions.\r\nThere is, however, less tendency to infection with the microbes forming\r\npus. There is a greater tendency to deteriorating action on the nervous\r\nsystem. There is in chronic alcoholism, as in syphilis, special tendency\r\nto that formation of connective tissue which destroys organs. The chronic\r\nmental disorders of chronic alcoholism resemble those of tuberculosis\r\nexcept that the capricious state and exaltation are less frequent than the\r\nsuspicional tendency which is deeper, and takes the direction of delusions\r\nof poisoning and insane jealousy. The last are due to the deteriorating\r\ninfluence of alcohol on the generative organs. Alcohol may limit its\r\naction to the central nervous system, and thus produce hereditary losses\r\nof power. It causes changes in the peripheral nerves which in the\r\noffspring find expression in spinal cord and brain disorder through\r\nextension of the morbid process. But for its deteriorating effects on the\r\novaries and testicles, alcohol would be a most serious social danger.\r\nThrough its action on the generative organs it tends to prevent the\r\nsurvival of the unfit, rather than to develop degenerates.\r\n\r\nOpium seems to be the Charybdis on which the human bark strikes when\r\nescaping from the Scylla of alcohol. Its abuse as a narcotic is much\r\nolder, even among the English-speaking races, than is generally suspected.\r\nMurrell, over ten years ago, demonstrated that the inhabitants of the fens\r\nof Lincolnshire had long employed opium as a prophylactic against malaria.\r\nThe ratio of insanity in these regions proved to be very great. The same\r\nconditions obtained in certain malarial regions of New Jersey and\r\nPennsylvania, where the use of strong infusions of poppy was common. The\r\nstatistics of Rush[154] as to opium-caused insanity in Pennsylvania,\r\nindicate that the percentage of American opium abuses at the beginning of\r\nthe nineteenth century was very great. The drug differs in two serious\r\nrespects from alcohol. It is nearer in chemical composition to nerve\r\ntissue, and the tendency to its use may be transmitted by the mother\r\ndirectly to the foetus. This, as Bureau and Ringer have shown, receives\r\nthrough the placenta from its opium-using mother a certain amount of\r\nmorphine. In consequence, the child in the first month of infancy must be\r\nnourished on the milk of an opium-using woman, or given opium in some\r\nother way lest it perish. To this fact Calkins[155] was the first to call\r\nattention. His results were corroborated later by Hubbard; Kiernan, of\r\nChicago[156]; Erlenmeyer, of Berlin; F. B. Earle, of Chicago; Mattison, of\r\nBrooklyn; Hughes, of St. Louis; and others. Amabile, of New York, showed\r\nthat not only were the children of opium-using mothers born with tendency\r\nto the opium habit, but that the mothers aborted frequently with twins,\r\nand that the children who survived were very liable to convulsions.\r\nIndependently of this factor the mental state produced by opium habit\r\nresembles in many respects that of the lunatic, in that the victim of\r\nopium is as unable to distinguish between his wishes and the facts, and\r\ntherefore often utters what appear to be sheer lies. Hence he is totally\r\nunreliable and has taken a step in mental and moral degeneracy that, by\r\nthe ordinary laws of heredity, must greatly increase, unless corrected by\r\nhealthy atavism and training in the next generation. Opium is a more\r\ndangerous factor of degeneracy than alcohol, since the opium user must be\r\nin a continuous state of intoxication to carry on his usual avocation,\r\nwhile abstinence is perfectly compatible with proper work on the part of\r\nthe drunkard. The opium habit is increased by the peculiar propaganda\r\ncarried on by the _habitues_ who justify their position by urging the use\r\nof opium for any ailment, however minimal. Opium, like alcohol, causes\r\nnervous exhaustion similar to, but greater than, that of the contagions\r\nand infections. From the affinity of opium to nerve tissue, from its\r\ntendency to stimulate the heart, thus causing increased blood supply to\r\nthe brain; from its action on the bowels and the increased resultant work\r\nof the liver, this nervous state is much intensified. Opium does not have\r\nas great tendencies to interfere with the structure of the ovary and\r\ntesticles as alcohol, hence the greater danger of the opium _habitue's_\r\nchildren surviving. Opium, when smoked, stimulates the reproductive\r\napparatus, and thus would greatly increase the number of degenerates due\r\nto this habit but for the defects due to the inheritance of the habit and\r\ntheir consequences.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--ANTE-CHRISTIAN IRISH PIPES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--ANTE-COLUMBIAN PIPES FROM SCULPTURE AT\r\nSTRATFORD-UPON-AVON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe origin of the use of tobacco is usually ascribed to the New World.\r\nThere is no doubt that immediately subsequent to the discovery of America,\r\nthe use of tobacco spread over the world, and that its employment by Sir\r\nWalter Raleigh made it fashionable. It is certain, however, that the\r\nRomans and Irish employed pipes for smoking long ere the Christian era\r\n(Fig. 1), but the substances smoked were not tobacco but dried aromatic\r\nleaves. The English before Columbus (Fig. 2) did the same. In Western Asia\r\nhistoric botanical evidence leaves no doubt that tobacco was indigenous.\r\nTobacco from the East hence probably encountered tobacco from the West,\r\nboth currents meeting in Asia Minor. As with alcohol and opium the\r\nstatistic method generally adopted proves fallacious when applied to the\r\ndegenerative effects of tobacco. Study of its effects on the individual is\r\nneeded to determine its effects on the race. The most careful researches\r\nshow that the typical effects occur as a rule after long-continued use of\r\ntobacco, sometimes not until twenty years or more. While many smokers\r\nreach old age, many fail to live to old age because they are smokers. The\r\nskin is the subject of itching and reddening, the nerves of taste are\r\nblunted, and patches develop in the throat; loss of appetite, epigastric\r\nfulness, pain, vomiting, and disturbance of bowel function are common.\r\nMenstrual disturbance occurs in women. In female cigar-makers abortion and\r\npluriparity are frequent. The sexual appetite is impaired and sometimes\r\nsterility and impotence occur; also disturbed heart action, palpitation,\r\nrapid and intermitting pulse, precordial anxiety, weakness, faintness and\r\ncollapse, with sclerosis of the coronary arteries of the heart and left\r\nventricular hypertrophy. Cigars and cigarettes produce irritation of the\r\nnose, mucous membrane, diminished smell, chronic hyperaemia of the\r\nepiglottis and larynx, and sometimes of the trachea and bronchi\r\npredisposing to consumption. Nicotine amblyopia, or sight weakness, is\r\ncommon, with central disturbances of the field of vision and with\r\ncolour-weakness of sight. Often there is disorder of the ear tubes and\r\ncongestion of drum, with loss of power of the hearing nerves, and\r\nconsequent noises in the ear. The central nervous system is affected. In\r\nhigh schools, non-smokers get on better than smokers. Children from 9 to\r\n15 years of age exhibit less intelligence, laziness, or other degenerative\r\ntendencies. Adults have head-pressure, sleeplessness, or drowsy stupor,\r\ndepression, apathy, and dizziness. There may also be ataxic symptoms,\r\nparetic weakness of bowel and bladder, trembling and spasms. Tobacco\r\ninsanities are comparatively rare in smokers, but are common in snuffers\r\nand still oftener in chewers.[157] In the precursory stage, which lasts\r\nabout three months, there is general uneasiness, restlessness, anxiety,\r\nsleeplessness, and mental depression, often of a religious type. After\r\nthis occurs precordial anxiety, and finally the psychosis proper\r\nconsisting of three stages: 1. Hallucinations of all senses, suicidal\r\ntendency, depression of spirits, attacks of fright with tendency to\r\nviolence and sleeplessness. 2. Exhilaration, slight emotional exaltation,\r\nagreeable hallucinations after from two to four weeks' relaxation, again\r\nfollowed by excitement. 3. The intervals between exaltation and depression\r\ndiminish, the patient becomes irritable, but otherwise not alive to his\r\nsurroundings, and perception and attention are lessened. The patient may\r\nbe cured in five or six months if he stop tobacco during the first stage.\r\nIn a year or so he may recover during the second stage. After the third\r\nstage the disease is frequently incurable. As the patient often becomes\r\n(especially by the use of the cigarette) an _habitue_ ere puberty, the\r\nproper development and balance of the sexual and intellectual system is\r\nchecked. These patients break down mentally and physically between 14 and\r\n25. The moral delinquencies, other than sexual, are often an especial\r\ntendency to forgery and deceit of parents. Frequently the insanity of\r\npuberty (hebephrenia) is precipitated by tobacco. The cigarette, if used\r\nmoderately, may be a sedative, but as used is a stimulant, and is often\r\nmade of spoiled tobacco, resembling in reaction morphine, and on animals\r\nacting in a somewhat similar manner. As tobacco turns the salivary glands\r\n(which are concerned in digestion of starch) into excretory glands, it\r\nleads to imperfect digestion of starch, to consequent irregular\r\nfermentation in the bowel, thus at once furnishing a culture medium for\r\nmicrobes, to form more violent toxins from, and also creating leucomaines,\r\nto interfere especially with a nervous system overstimulated by nicotine.\r\nThis is one great reason why those who snuff and chew tobacco more\r\nfrequently become insane from tobacco than smokers, albeit these last are\r\nnot exempt.\r\n\r\nStatistics from the female employes of the Spanish, French, Cuban, and\r\nAmerican tobacco factories, while defective and somewhat vitiated by the\r\nco-existence of other conditions producing degeneracy, support the opinion\r\nthat the maternal tobacco habit (whether intentional or the result of an\r\natmosphere consequent on occupation) is the cause of frequent\r\nmiscarriage, of high infantile mortality, of defective children, and of\r\ninfantile convulsions.[158]\r\n\r\nTobacco, therefore, in its influence on the paternal and maternal\r\norganism, exhausts the nervous system so that an acquired neurosis results\r\nin such a way as to be transmissible.\r\n\r\nProfessional tea-tasters have long been known to suffer from nervous\r\nsymptoms; very early in the practice of their occupation the head pressure\r\nsymptoms of neurasthenia occur. Tremor also occurs early. While changes in\r\nthe optic nerve have not been demonstrated beyond a doubt, still eye\r\ndisorders have been observed in the pauper tea-drinkers of the United\r\nStates and in the tea-tasters of Russia, thus indicating that similar\r\nchanges to those produced by tobacco and alcohol are likely to occur in\r\nthe optic nerve from tea. Bullard[159] has found that tea has a cumulative\r\neffect. In his experience toxic effects are not produced by less than five\r\ncups daily. The symptoms manifested are those of nervous excitement\r\nresembling hysteria, at times almost amounting to fury; nervous dyspepsia;\r\nrapid and irregular heart action; neuralgia of the heart; helmet-like\r\nsensation on the head, and tenderness along the spine. James Wood,[160] of\r\nBrooklyn, found that 10 per cent. of those under treatment at the city\r\nhospitals exhibited similar symptoms. Of these 69 per cent. were females.\r\nEvery symptom ascribed by Bullard to tea was found by Wood in his cases,\r\nwho also found that the women manifested irregularities in menstruation\r\nof neurasthenic or hysteria type. He has found these symptoms to be\r\nproduced by one-half of the quantity of tea charged with these effects by\r\nBullard. The _Lancet_[161] several years ago, from an editorial analysis\r\nof the effects of tea-tippling, took the position that in no small degree\r\nnervous symptoms occurring in children during infancy were due to the\r\npractice of the mothers, both of the working and society class, indulging\r\nin the excessive use of tea, the excess being judged by its effects on the\r\nindividual and not by the amount taken. Convulsions and resultant\r\ninfantile paralysis were frequently noticed among the children of these\r\ntea-tipplers. Observations among the factory population and the workers in\r\nthe clothing sweating-shops show that tea neurasthenia, presenting all the\r\nordinary symptoms of nervous exhaustion, is especially common among these.\r\nIt is evident that tea produces a grave form of neurasthenia readily\r\ntransmissible to descendants. In addition to its effects directly upon the\r\nnervous system, tea tends to check both stomach and bowel digestion, and\r\nthus increases the self-poisoning which is so prominent a cause,\r\nconsequence, and aggravation of these nervous conditions.\r\n\r\nCoffee exerts a very similar action to that of tea, albeit the nervous\r\nsymptoms produced by it are usually secondary to the disturbances of the\r\nstomach and bowel digestion. Coffee produces tremor, insomnia, nervous\r\ndyspepsia, and helmet sensations. With the exception of certain districts\r\nof the United States, coffee abuse is not carried to such an extent as\r\ntea, albeit in these, as in some portions of Germany, the habit is an\r\nexcessive one. The conditions described result in Germany as frequently\r\nas they do in the United States. Mendel[162] finds that in Germany coffee\r\ninebriety is increasing and supplanting alcohol. Profound depression with\r\nsleeplessness and frequent vertex headache are early symptoms. Strong\r\ncoffee will remove these temporarily, but it soon loses its effects, and\r\nthey recur. There is much tremor, especially of the hands. The heart's\r\naction is rapid and irregular. Nervous dyspepsia is frequent. L. Bremer,\r\nof St. Louis, Mo., has observed similar conditions among both Germans and\r\nAmericans there.\r\n\r\nWhile coca took its place only recently among the toxic causes of\r\ndegeneracy, it was old as a factor in the degeneration of the Peruvian\r\nlong ere the discovery of America by Columbus. Forty-three years ago\r\nJohnston[163] wrote that even Europeans in different parts of Peru had\r\nfallen into the coca habit long practised by the Indians. A confirmed\r\nchewer of coca is called a _coquero_, and he becomes more thoroughly a\r\nslave to the leaf than the inveterate drunkard is to alcohol. Sometimes\r\nthe _coquero_ is overtaken by an irresistible craving, and betakes himself\r\nfor days together to the woods, and there indulges unrestrainedly in coca.\r\nYoung men of the best families of Peru are considered incurable when\r\naddicted to this extreme degree of excess. They abandon white society, and\r\nlive in the woods or in Indian villages. In Peru the term white _coquero_\r\nhas the same sense as irreclaimable drunken tramp. The inveterate\r\n_coquero_ has an unsteady gait, yellow skin, quivering lips, hesitant\r\nspeech, and general apathy. The drug has assumed an unusual prominence in\r\nthe field of degeneracy since the discovery of its alkaloid, cocaine.\r\nSince then there has sprung into existence in both Europe and the\r\nEnglish-speaking countries the world over, a habit which, while much\r\nover-estimated, is undoubtedly growing, and aggravating as well as\r\nproducing degeneracy. Many of the cases reported as due to cocaine are,\r\nhowever, chargeable to the desire of the hysteric or neurasthenic to\r\nsecure a new sensation, or the desire on the part of the opium or whisky\r\n_habitue_ to try a dodge for forgiveness by friends. The habit is very\r\nfrequently induced by patent medicines taken to cure catarrh by the\r\nneurasthenic, or to cure nervousness by hysterics as well. As the\r\ndeformities of the nose passages predispose to what is called \"catarrh,\"\r\npatent medicines for local application containing cocaine are frequently\r\nemployed in the treatment of this supposed constitutional disease, with\r\nthe result of aggravating the original degeneracy. As the youth under the\r\nstress of puberty frequently ascribes all his ills to catarrh, he also\r\nemploys very frequently snuffs containing cocaine, and has his nervous\r\ncondition much aggravated thereby. Among the nostrums urged in the\r\nnewspapers and magazines for this condition, so often resultant on nerve\r\nstress, is a certain notorious snuff containing 3 per cent. of cocaine.\r\nFrom the description given by Johnson of the _coquero_ there can be no\r\ndoubt but tramps, errabund lunatics, and paupers result from this habit,\r\nto give birth to degenerates in the next generation.\r\n\r\nLead has been found to produce in those exposed to its fumes a systemic\r\nnervous exhaustion, characterised by local paralysis about the wrist as\r\nwell as the general symptoms of profound systemic nerve tire. This may\r\nresult, as Tanquerel des Planches[164] pointed out nearly half a century\r\nago, in acute insanity of the confusional type followed very often by\r\nforms of mental disorder of a chronic type resembling paretic dementia. In\r\nsome cases the patient recovers from the acute insanity to suffer\r\nthereafter from epilepsy. In other cases, as Kiernan has shown,[165] an\r\nirritable suspicional condition results, in which the patient may live for\r\nyears, marry, and leave offspring. This last condition and the epileptic\r\nare the most dangerous as to the production of degeneracy. As has already\r\nbeen pointed out, the women employed in the pottery factories in Germany\r\nsuffer according to Rennert[166] from a form of lead poisoning which\r\nproduces decidedly degenerative effects upon the offspring. These women\r\nhad frequent abortions, often produced deaf-mutes, and very frequently\r\nmacrocephalic children.\r\n\r\nBrass workers suffer from a very similar nervous condition to that\r\nproduced by lead. Hogden,[167] of Birmingham, called attention to the\r\ngrave forms of nervous exhaustion produced among brass-workers. The period\r\nduring which the patient is able to pursue the occupation without breaking\r\ndown is longer than that of the lead workers. Women, like men, are exposed\r\nto this condition. The chief effect produced, so far as offspring have\r\nbeen observed, is chiefly frequent abortions and infantile paralysis.\r\n\r\nThe occupations employing mercury, whether mining, mirror-making, or\r\ngilding, produce forms of systemic nervous exhaustion in which the most\r\nmarked symptom (but less important from a sanitary standpoint) is a tremor\r\namounting at times almost to shaking-palsy. Like all other systemic\r\nnervous exhaustions, the mercurial one may appear as degeneracy in the\r\noffspring. The employment of women in match factories and tenement house\r\nsweating shops is growing. The chief toxic effect of phosphorus is not the\r\nlocalised jaw necrosis. This is but an evidence of the progressive system\r\nsaturation with phosphorus. It bears the same relation to the more\r\ndangerous effects of phosphorus that \"blue gum\" does to the systemic\r\neffects of lead.\r\n\r\nEvery condition arising from a toxic cause capable of producing profound\r\nsystemic nervous exhaustion in the ancestor, and especially the\r\nancestress, is likely to be transmitted as degeneracy to the descendant.\r\nUndoubtedly with the growing tendency of woman to pass from the ill-paid\r\nwork of the seamstress to the better paid but dangerous occupations, a\r\ncertain seeming increase in degeneracy must result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the gains of human advance in evolution stand out prominently\r\ncomplete immunity from certain diseases due to germs, and partial immunity\r\nfrom others, which last immunity results in chronic types, rather than in\r\nacute, because of increased vital resistance in man. Tuberculosis and\r\ndourine, acute diseases in the cow and horse, have become chronic\r\ndiseases, tuberculosis (or consumption) and syphilis, in man. Such\r\nchronicity is evidence of advance, yet it constitutes an element of\r\ndegeneracy, since the victim of the chronic disease is able to leave more\r\noffspring than would be possible were the disorder acute. In other\r\nrespects acute and chronic contagions and infections exert the same\r\ninfluence in regard to degeneracy. The germ of the disease may be\r\ninherited, or general nutrition of the foetus may be so checked in\r\ndevelopment that the child inherits a predisposition to disease.\r\n\r\nThrough this check to foetal development the phagocytes, or white blood\r\ncells, become so weakened that they are unable to devour foetal structures\r\nas useless to man as the tadpole's tail (which it devours) is useless to\r\nthe developed frog. This power being weakened, the organs which form\r\nantitoxins (or protective tonics against disease), from lack of\r\ndevelopment fail to perform their function. For this reason in the\r\ndegenerate many infections and contagions assume their old destructive\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nThe influence of these disorders in the parent may result in the bony\r\nmal-development shown to occur in animals by Charrin and Gley, and in man\r\nby Coolidge. The facial bones, jaw, and teeth are peculiarly liable to be\r\nthus affected. Though the effect of the disease on the parent be but\r\ntemporary, the child's development may be checked as to higher tendencies.\r\nThus mothers have borne moral imbeciles, epileptics or lunatics, after a\r\npregnancy during which they were attacked by contagious disease, albeit\r\nthe children of subsequent and previous pregnancies were normal.\r\n\r\nThe children of pregnancies previous to the one complicated by the\r\ncontagious disease may be healthy, while those of subsequent pregnancies\r\nare defective. Any contagious or infectious disease may not only interfere\r\ntemporarily with the bodily strength, but may produce complete change in\r\nthe parent's system extending even to the highest acquirement of man. In\r\nsome occur changes thus graphically described by Bulwer: \"There have been\r\nmen who, after an illness in which life itself seemed suspended, have\r\narisen as out of a sleep with characters wholly changed. Before gentle,\r\ngood, and truthful, they now become bitter, malignant, and false. To those\r\nwhom they before loved they evince repugnance and loathing. Sometimes this\r\nchange is so marked and irrational that their kindred ascribe it to\r\nmadness. Not the madness which affects them in the ordinary business of\r\nlife, but that which turns into harshness and discord the moral harmony\r\nwhich results from natures whole and complete.\"\r\n\r\nThe nerve centres controlling nutrition, growth, repair, secretion, and\r\nexcretion are often as deeply affected as those checks constituting\r\nmorality. At the periods of physiologic stress these effects are\r\nespecially noticeable. Moral insanity, intellectual insanity, unequal\r\nmental balance, hysteria, precocious sexuality, unconscious mendacity,\r\nmental parasitism (the germ of pauperism), epilepsy, neuroses, and all\r\ntypes of nutritive and constitutional defects result. The nutritional\r\ndefects may appear chiefly in the walls of the blood vessels and\r\nlymphatics. While these are most common in the chronic infections and\r\ncontagions, they often occur in acute typhoid fever, scarlatina,\r\ndiphtheria, whooping-cough, &c. Proper blood supply and utilisation of\r\nwaste is thus prevented. Organs cannot perform their function, and are\r\npredisposed to disease from disuse and from weakness of the\r\ndisease-fighting phagocytes and antitoxins. From this results irregularity\r\nof organ function, which is hereditarily transmissible. The weakened\r\nvessel walls yield to strain, and thus produce local stomach, bowel,\r\nliver, gland, and kidney disorders. This organ weakness may alone be\r\ntransmitted to the offspring. The functions of the great glands (thyroid,\r\nthymus, suprarenals, pituitary body, bone-marrow, testicles and ovaries)\r\nwhich secrete principles necessary to the equal balance of nutrition are\r\nperverted. The liver, in the acute but more particularly the chronic\r\ncontagions, paralysed in nerve tone, fails in its function of\r\npoison-destroyer, as for the same reason the kidneys fail in their power\r\nof ejecting hurtful waste. Through this interaction of perverted\r\nnutrition, imperfect poison-destruction, and deficient waste ejection\r\nresult and continue the states of nervous exhaustion after the contagions\r\nand infections. Thus nerve exhaustion with its suspicion, its capricious\r\nhopefulness and gaiety, is practically continuous in tuberculosis,\r\nsyphilis, and leprosy.\r\n\r\nThe acute and chronic contagions and infections so lower cell vitality\r\nthrough the perverted functions described that inert connective tissue\r\nreplaces healthy working cells. This is especially the case with syphilis,\r\nwhich, when driven from the system, leaves behind it a tendency to disease\r\nbased on this connective tissue increase. This tendency, latent in the\r\nancestor, may be so intensified in the descendant as to produce the\r\nhereditary ataxias (loss of movement power), and like neuroses. At the\r\nperiods of stress such tendencies are peculiarly potent, and not only\r\ncheck, but reverse development. The chronic contagions and infections are\r\nmost fertile sources of human degeneracy since their weakened products are\r\nenabled to survive under modern beneficence. Of these chronic contagions\r\ntwo (tuberculosis and syphilis) alone deserve attention, since the third\r\n(leprosy) exerts but little influence. Despite its existence for more than\r\na century (New Brunswick and Nova Scotia on the north and Louisiana on the\r\nsouth) on the borders of the United States, despite its subsequent\r\nimportation from Norway, Sweden, China, and Hawaii, its spread has been\r\ninfinitesimal, and its influence on race deterioration is still less\r\ndemonstrable.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis (\"the white death\") is from every standpoint a social danger\r\nmore serious than syphilis. The father, as in syphilis, can infect the\r\nmother, but sterility is much less likely. As has already been shown in\r\nthe chapter on heredity, plural and quickly repeated birth are common in\r\ntuberculous families. The tuberculous diathesis (or \"habit,\" as Weismann\r\ncalls it) was very early observed in the United States. Nearly seventy\r\nyears ago W. P. Dewees, of Philadelphia, pointed out its frequency and its\r\nearly observation by the Greek and Roman physicians. He cites a case\r\nillustrative of the extent and uniformity of diathesis in a very numerous\r\nfamily. This predisposition arose on the side of the mother, though she\r\nlived herself to the age of forty-three, a period much exceeding that of\r\nany of her children, with the exception of a son, who died in his\r\nforty-fifth year. This lady bore twenty-three children without being able\r\nto suckle any but the two first. The males much exceed the females in\r\nnumber, yet there did not appear to be any exception to their favour in\r\nthe transmission of the phthisical taint, except that they attained in\r\ngeneral a greater age before they died. Some died about puberty, others at\r\nmanhood or womanhood; but all, with the exception just stated, under\r\nthirty. The disease was never very rapid; they generally complained from\r\none to two years before they died. The men had a healthy, even in some\r\ninstances an athletic, appearance until the disease became open and\r\ndecided. In their growth and stature they altogether resembled the father,\r\nwho was not only a remarkably stout man, but lived beyond the eightieth\r\nyear. The females, who passed puberty (two in number) were rather stout\r\nwomen, while the mother was both delicate and small. This family lived in\r\nthe country, was very wealthy, and always accustomed to the various means\r\ngenerally found successful either in destroying the predisposition or\r\nlessening its influence, yet in no one instance in this family were they\r\nsuccessful, though the open form of the disease was retarded perhaps in\r\nall. The females died the earliest.[168]\r\n\r\nThe blood vessel system is affected as regards development in such\r\nfamilies. The heart is often diminutive; the right ventricle is\r\nexaggerated. Two great types of degenerate constitutions are produced in\r\nchildren of the tuberculous. One of these may well come under De\r\nGiovanni's category of the torpid. The victim is usually coarse-featured\r\nand coarse-skinned, with peculiarly unstable mentality; slowness of\r\ncomprehension is combined with power of continuity of thought; at times\r\nmental apathy alternates with quickness of perception. Decided\r\nexaggeration of the lymphatic system (connected with utilising of material\r\nelsewhere than at the point where it has been rendered unfit) with\r\ndeficient function occurs, resulting in fitting a soil for germs. In other\r\nrespects the torpid resembles the second type, the erethistic (nervously\r\nfussy type) of De Giovanni. This is generally characterised by the\r\npresence of a clear complexion, a fine skin, and features well cut and\r\noften beautiful. The lips are red and the teeth pearly white, though\r\nliable to early decay, and the eyes are large and full, the pupil being\r\nwidely dilated and the white of the eye beautifully clear. The eyelashes\r\nare long, curved and silky, and the blue veins show distinctly through the\r\nclear thin skin. The bones are light, the hands and feet well formed, the\r\nstature often tall, and the whole figure slightly and gracefully built.\r\nThe erethists generally remain spare, and have a strong dislike to fatty\r\nfood. They are vivacious and excitable, and the intellectual faculties are\r\noften highly developed. At an early age they show marvellous activity. The\r\nregularity with which such precocious tubercular children die has given\r\nrise to proverbs anent exceptionally clever children that they are \"too\r\nwise to live long.\" Wanting in stamina, they are incapable of prolonged\r\nexertion either of mind or body, and break down under conditions which\r\nwould not prove injurious to the healthy. They are continually taking\r\n\"cold,\" and are prone throughout life to affections of an inflammatory\r\ncharacter. Multiple and frequent pregnancies occur. The children,\r\ndeficient in vitality, are carried off in numbers during infancy by\r\nconvulsions, brain fever, water on the brain, exhaustion, diarrhoea,\r\nteething, and other ailments, or they succumb at the second detention or\r\nat puberty. A small proportion reach maturity. Few live beyond thirty-five\r\nor forty years of age. However brilliant intellectually, they are equally\r\nemotional, impressionable, and impulsive. There is a marked absence of\r\nmental stability. They are suspiciously capricious. The great secreting\r\nand eliminating glands undergo with peculiar frequency the perversions\r\nalready described.\r\n\r\nNeuroses and psychoses are peculiarly frequent in childhood and youth. The\r\ndegenerative power of tuberculosis is not always due to the influence of\r\nthe germ, or even of the toxin produced by it, but to the state of nerve\r\nweakness resultant on the disorder. The victim of tuberculosis (especially\r\nif affecting the lung) is a suspicious, yet hopeful, nervous invalid,\r\nwhose functions are irregularly performed and who is therefore likely to\r\nleave scions with greater defect, especially as the maternal factor,\r\neither through infection or worry, can hardly escape being weakened.\r\nTuberculosis attacks the bones of the offspring, especially the spine and\r\nhip-joint, but the victim of these last frequently regain health after\r\napparent recovery from the local disease through surgical procedures. If\r\nthe victim of the hip-joint disorder be of the erethist type marriage is\r\nnot unlikely. Despite the deformity produced by spine disorder, popular\r\nsuperstition as to the \"good luck\" of a hunchback leads to marriage among\r\nthe working class. Monetary and social considerations effect the same\r\nresult among the wealthy classes. Here deformity does not prevent\r\nmarriage, but predisposes to sterility through birth difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe influence of syphilis is, in a general sense, the same as that of\r\ntuberculosis, except that by reversing the principle of individuation it\r\nleads to greater sterility. Furthermore it exhibits greater tendencies to\r\nrevert towards health, and yields (even in the inherited form) more to\r\nmedicinal treatment. The inherited form at times presents itself in two\r\ntypes closely simulating those due to tuberculosis. Like the bacillus of\r\ntuberculosis, the syphilitic germ attacks every structure and organ of the\r\nbody. Its reversal of the principle of individuation, causing excessive\r\ncell formation, produces more decidedly demonstrable effects. As syphilis\r\nis more apt to attack the central nervous system than tuberculosis, it\r\nwould seem that it is a greater race-deteriorating factor. The excessive\r\ntendency to cell formation, however, produces impotence in man, sterility\r\nand abortion in woman. There are very good reasons for believing that the\r\nrace is becoming immune to syphilis, and that this disease will disappear.\r\nIts greatest race-deteriorating effect is in preparing the soil for\r\ntuberculosis and other infections and contagions.\r\n\r\nThe influence of contagions and infections on degeneracy is therefore by\r\nno means slight. Each disease can produce grave constitutional defects in\r\nthe ancestor likely to be intensified in the offspring. The greatest\r\nsocial dangers result from tuberculosis; the next from syphilis. Typhoid\r\nfever, scarlatina, small-pox, measles, diphtheria, whooping-cough, and all\r\nother contagions, however, may produce these constitutional defects,\r\neither through the mother during pregnancy or through their secondary\r\neffects on the ancestor's constitution. If the subject be attacked before\r\nthe close of the periods of dental stress an arrest of development of the\r\nbones of the face may result with irregularities in the shape and position\r\nof the teeth. These, then, are stigmata of degeneracy, especially due, in\r\nthe individual presenting them, to the contagions and infections rather\r\nthan to inheritance alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCLIMATE, SOIL, AND FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the factors constituting environment few have impressed the\r\nbiologist so much as climate, soil, and food. The seeming modifications\r\nproduced by these have made a very decided impression on the sceptical\r\nWeismann, who stated that \"the possibility is not to be rejected that\r\ninfluences continued for a long time, that is, for generations, such as\r\ntemperature, climate, kind of nourishment, &c., which may affect the germ\r\nplasm, as well as any other part of the organism, may produce a change in\r\nthe constitution of the germ plasm. But such influences would not then\r\nproduce individual variations, but would necessarily modify, in the same\r\nway, all the individuals of a species living in a certain district. It is\r\npossible, though it cannot be proved, that many climatic varieties have\r\narisen in this manner. Possibly other phenomena of variation must be\r\nreferred to a variation in the structure of the germ plasm produced\r\ndirectly by external influences.\"\r\n\r\nConsidering the changes brought about in European plants and animals in\r\nAustralia, those occurring in the East Indian mongoose in Jamaica, the\r\nchanges in European plants and animals in America, or American animals in\r\nEurope and European animals in Asia, Weismann's position seems judicial.\r\n\r\nThe influences dependent on food, soil, and climate producing normal\r\nmodifications have been remarkably illustrated in the gilled batrachian\r\nAxolotl. This, under the nourishment and change of surroundings of the\r\nJardin des Plantes, was transformed into a gill-less batrachian, which had\r\nhitherto been regarded as belonging to a totally distinct family.\r\n\r\nAccording to Darwin,[169] English dogs degenerate in India in a few\r\ngenerations, losing the peculiarities of form and mental character which\r\ndistinguish their particular race, in spite of the greatest care in\r\nselection and prevention of crossing. An instance which well deserves the\r\nconsideration of those anthropologists who attach but little importance to\r\nthe influence of the environment and to the value of speech as an aid to\r\nthe ethnologist is that of the Wurtemburgers, who settled (1816) near\r\nTiflis in Russia. They had originally fair or red hair, light or blue eyes\r\nand coarse, broad features. In the first generation brown hair and black\r\neyes began to appear; in the second black hair and eyes became the rule,\r\nwhile the face acquired an oval form. These changes were due entirely to\r\nthe surroundings, no instance of crossing with Georgian natives being on\r\nrecord. At the same time, these transformed Wurtemburgers continue to\r\nspeak their German mother-tongue uninfluenced by the local dialects.[170]\r\n\r\nThe alleged transformation of the British into the Yankee is commonly\r\ncited in illustration of the supposed effects of soil and climate. Three\r\ndecades[171] ago Vogt remarked that American Anglo-Saxons or Yankees were\r\ninstanced as illustration of change of character. Already, after the\r\nsecond generation, according to Pruner-Bey, the Yankee presents features\r\nof the Indian type. At a later period the glandular system is reduced to\r\nthe minimum of its normal development. The skin becomes like leather; the\r\ncolour of the cheeks is replaced by sallowness. The head becomes smaller\r\nand rounder, and is covered with stiff, dark hair; the neck becomes\r\nlonger, and there is greater development of the cheek-bones and the\r\nmasseters. The temporal fossae becomes deeper, the jaw-bones more massive,\r\nthe eyes lie in deep approximated sockets. The iris is dark, the glance is\r\npiercing and wild. The long bones, especially in the superior extremities,\r\nare lengthened so that the gloves manufactured in England and France for\r\nthe American market are of a particular make, with very long fingers. The\r\nfemale pelvis approaches that of the male. According to Quatrefages,\r\nAmerica has thus, from the English race, produced a new white race which\r\nmight be called the Yankee race. Vogt believes that America dries up the\r\nskin and reduces the fat, an effect to which all the above differences\r\nmight be reduced. That the head becomes smaller he utterly denies. Exact\r\ncranial measurements by Morton show that the skull of the Yankee is at\r\nleast as large as that of the Englishman.\r\n\r\nSimilar changes have been noted in the Anglo-Saxon Australians. The true\r\nexplanation of this is that early rigorous environment tended to cause\r\nreversion to types not uncommon even now in Great Britain, Ireland, and\r\nScandinavia, resultant on the admixture of primitive types to which\r\nreference has been made. The same error has been made about the pelvis as\r\nabout the skull. The male pelvis in the American is approximating the\r\nfemale in accordance with advance, since, as Havelock Ellis has\r\nshown,[172] not only by his skull, but by his pelvis, modern man is\r\nfollowing a path first marked out by woman. The skull of the modern woman\r\nis more markedly feminine than that of the savage woman, while that of the\r\nmodern man has approximated to it. Not only is the pelvis of the modern\r\nwoman much more feminine in character than that of the primitive woman,\r\nbut the modern man's pelvis is also becoming more feminine.\r\n\r\nThe validity of Vogt's position anent the \"Yankee\" change of type is fully\r\ndemonstrated by the following portraits of four generations of a noted\r\nAmerican family with a Scandinavian patronymic, coming originally from a\r\ndistrict in England where the alleged \"Yankee\" type (even to its nasal\r\ntone and so-called \"Americanisms\") occurs. The first \"American\" of the\r\nfamily (Fig. 3) was born in Connecticut in 1761 and died in 1826. He had a\r\ndolichocephalic head with massive jaws, prominent lips, especially the\r\nupper. The nose is long and the eyes are set close together, the forehead\r\nvery high and straight. Quite a change is noticeable in the second\r\ngeneration (Fig. 4). The face is not so long, the lateral diameter of the\r\nhead is larger, the forehead more prominent, and the eyes are a little\r\nfarther apart. The nose is about the same length and while there is a\r\nresemblance about the mouth and chin, the distance from the front of the\r\nchin to the tip of the nose is not quite so long. The change seems to be\r\ndue to shortening of the chin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--DOLICHOCEPHALIC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--MESOCEPHALIC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--MESOCEPHALIC.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--BRACHYCEPHALIC.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next generation (Fig. 5) shows still further changes. The forehead is\r\nbroader and less retreating than either. There is perceptibly lest\r\nprognathism. There is less prominence in the supraorbital region.\r\n\r\nThe fourth generation exhibits (Fig. 6) a nearly brachycephalic head. The\r\nhead is nearly round, forehead full, eyes set in the head to correspond\r\nwith its width, nose broad, upper lips short, and the lower jaw is\r\nevidently much shorter in a perpendicular line. These changes are due to a\r\nprotruding forehead, receding chin, and delicate features.\r\n\r\nThe climate of the United States exercises, according to certain\r\nsociologists, on the first generation of European immigrants, a\r\ndeleterious influence in regard to fecundity. The decrease in the\r\nfecundity of the American woman has been charged to various anti-social\r\ncauses (abortion and prevention of conception) and to a \"nervousness\"\r\ninduced by the climate. A seemingly fair test of the influence of the\r\nclimate would be a race elsewhere fecund, and whose religion encourages\r\nfecundity, decreasing in the first generation after immigration to the\r\nUnited States. Such a race is the Jewish. According to Gihon's analysis of\r\nthe United States census of 1890[173] the Jewish birth rate is\r\ndiminishing. From the mothers born in the United States the average is\r\n3.56 children, as against 5.24 for those born in Germany, 5.36 for those\r\nin Russia and Poland, 5.27 for those in Hungary, and 5.44 for those in\r\nBohemia. These figures, however, do not demonstrate the influence of\r\nclimate, but of environment. The Jew, unlike the earlier American\r\ncolonists, is not exposed to the stress of frontier life. He has a more\r\nfavourable mental and physical environment than on the continent of\r\nEurope. This fact, therefore, does not demonstrate the effects of climate,\r\nbut is really chargeable to climate, food, soil, and other factors\r\nconstituting environment. That climate cannot be considered apart from\r\nthese factors is shown, as I pointed out several years ago, by the fact\r\nthat the United States surveyors in Minnesota reported to the national\r\nauthorities that it was impossible to live the whole year in that state\r\nbecause of the extremely cold winter. Now, not only do people live and\r\ncultivate the soil throughout the entire state, but large cities have\r\nsprung up still farther north, and the country around has become well\r\npopulated. Hence, in dealing with influences of climate, change of food\r\nand hygienic conditions must be taken into account. The error of the\r\nAmerican surveyors as to the acclimatisation of the white race in cold\r\nclimates has been emphasised as to the tropics and arctics. Here, however,\r\nthe same error has been demonstrated by very careful researches. The\r\nexperience of the Arctic regions as to necessity for change in diet and\r\nhygiene has been fully borne out by observations on the Anglo-Saxon in the\r\ntropics. The early experience of the English in India, upon which a fatal\r\nprognosis as to the future of British India was based, turns out to have\r\nbeen erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe influence of climate involves more than temperature. Stokvis, in a\r\npaper read before the Tenth International Medical Congress, at Berlin, on\r\nthe comparative pathology of the human races with reference to the vital\r\nresistance of Europeans in tropical climates,[174] finds that the\r\nEuropean immigrant in the tropics is assailed by two hostile forces:\r\ntropico-thermal and tropico-infectious agencies. The expression of innate\r\nracial peculiarities, like the variations of vegetable life and the\r\nvarieties of animal life from effects of increased temperature, are such\r\nas occur in the inhabitants of temperate regions during the height of\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\nMarestang and Eykman find that neither high temperature alone nor\r\nmeteorological agencies, apart from other deleterious influences, can\r\nproduce that impoverishment of blood called \"tropical anaemia.\" Stokvis\r\nshows that the tropical European does not prove inferior to the aboriginal\r\nwith respect to thermal agencies. He is less susceptible to chill than the\r\nnative. Mortality statistics of respiratory organ affections are greater\r\nfor the native. While the European suffers more from liver disease than\r\nthe native, the latter is less addicted to alcoholic drinks and pork. The\r\npercentage of deaths from cases treated is, however, more than twice as\r\ngreat with the native as with the European. Variations of physiologic life\r\nunder tropical thermal conditions have little to do with the race. The\r\nvital resistance of the immigrant European (the European transformed into\r\na permanent high-summer man) is somewhat greater than that of the native\r\nraces.\r\n\r\nRespecting the disease-producing effects of tropical infectious agencies,\r\nthe experience of the last ten years (1880-90) is very different from that\r\nprior to 1860.\r\n\r\nAverage annual death-rate per thousand:--\r\n\r\n                                                   European      Native\r\n                                                   Soldiers.

Acclimatibility of strong, healthy,\r\nadult Europeans of both sexes in tropical climates must be admitted\r\nwithout any reserve, provided that they assiduously observe all hygienic\r\nrules. Stokvis disproves the allegation that the European is not able to\r\nproduce in tropical regions more than three or four generations of true\r\nEuropean blood, and that from the third or fourth generation onward\r\nsterility is the rule.\r\n\r\nSo accustomed, remarked Felken, however, is a man to his environment that\r\nit is difficult to remove an European from his home in the temperate\r\nregion to any other, and yet for him to retain his health. Much may be\r\ndone in the tropics to render climate more salubrious and sanitary\r\nprecautions will do a great deal for the health of the community. But when\r\nall is done permanent residence for Europeans under European conditions is\r\nout of the question in the low-lying regions of the tropics. Comparatively\r\nfew areas exist in the tropics where any great success for European\r\ncolonisation can be prophesied from altitude alone. The influence of\r\naltitude on the physiologic characteristics is, however, very evident. The\r\nresidents at high altitudes are strong, robust, buoyant, and of great\r\nmental and physical endurance.\r\n\r\nIn disproof of this position of Felken, Viault, of Bordeaux, has shown\r\nthat the phenomena resultant on the acclimation of man at great altitudes\r\ncomes neither from the frequency of respiratory movements nor from greater\r\nactivity of the pulmonary circulation as has been asserted, but from\r\nincrease of red blood globules. While the effects of both excessive heat\r\nand excessive cold may be admitted, even there other factors play a part.\r\nVery high mean temperature with low humidity is more likely to result in\r\nsunstroke and allied conditions than high temperature with high humidity.\r\nLow temperature of the Arctic regions tends to produce anaemia in natives\r\nof temperate zones. Food and depressing circumstances have, however, to be\r\ntaken into consideration.\r\n\r\nSunstroke produces the ordinary phenomena of nervous exhaustion, but the\r\npatient becomes more irritable, suspicious, and extremely proud. As these\r\npatients are not recognised for a long times as insane they often marry\r\nand produce degenerates. Kiernan reports a case in which father and mother\r\n(both of healthy stock) were overcome by the heat during one of the\r\nprocessions of the American Centenaries. The children born before the\r\nsunstroke were healthy, but there had been no children for five years\r\npreviously. A year subsequent to the sunstroke (which was followed by a\r\nchange in character in both parents) the woman had triplets, one of which\r\ndied soon after birth from convulsions. The second of the triplets, a\r\ngirl, became epileptic at 2, a prostitute at 16, and chronically insane at\r\n20. The third triplet became a puberty lunatic at 16. Of three children\r\nsubsequently born, two are epileptics and one is a moral imbecile who\r\nmanifests premonitory evidences of paranoia. Sunstroke, however, underlies\r\nmany cases of alcoholism. Not a few of the instances of degeneration\r\ncharged to alcoholism are, in reality, due to the nervous condition\r\narising from the exhaustion produced by sunstroke. To this factor was in\r\nno small degree due the extremely large infant mortality of the English in\r\nIndia of the first half of the present century. While temperature plays a\r\npart in producing degeneracy in the offspring through its production of\r\nsystemic disorder in the ancestor, it is usually associated with other\r\nfactors which aid or predispose to its effects. It also predisposes to the\r\ngreater action of other causes. Very frequently the sun-struck person,\r\nrendered incapable of continued labour by irritability, becomes a tramp or\r\na pauper, either of which conditions tends to accelerate the degenerative\r\nprocess and furthermore to increase the possible chances of passing down\r\nthe effect through heredity by the ease with which illicit relationships\r\nare contracted. The least intelligent of the prostitute class, or rather,\r\nof that class of nymphomaniacs who have not fully entered upon a\r\nprostitute career, are driven into the workhouse or almshouse, where they\r\noften remain for years, or depart at intervals, leaving their offspring to\r\nbe reared at public expense. The number of such children born yearly in\r\nalmshouses is at least ten thousand in the United States.[175] An enormous\r\nproportion of these die in infancy but sufficient survive to form a potent\r\nsource of degenerates.\r\n\r\nThe influence of overheating further predisposes to the attack of microbes\r\neven in the temperate climates, and to constitutional defects resultant on\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nA factor of degeneracy as related to soil on which much stress has been\r\nlaid, is that of goitre. This has been carefully studied by Munson[176]\r\namong the Indians on the reservation in the United States. The number was\r\n77,173, of whom 2.36 per cent. had goitre. As regards geographic\r\ndistribution the disease is more prevalent in the southern part of\r\nMontana. Goitre was reported as practically unknown among the white\r\nsettlers living about the reservations where goitre was prevalent among\r\nthe Indians. Fully 80 per cent. of the cases occur in Indian women, the\r\ndisease being not only much less frequent, but also less decided and less\r\nextensive in the male. The average age of onset of the disease was from 12\r\nto 14 years. There are many instances illustrating the apparent heredity\r\nof goitre. Several consecutive generations show its development. Only one\r\ncase is reported in which goitre was associated with cretinism. Goitre\r\namong Indians cannot be traced to high altitudes, climate or water\r\ncontaining excess of calcium magnesium salts. The disease is apparently\r\ndue to insanitary surroundings, depressing constitutional conditions,\r\nimproper and excessively nitrogenous diet. This condition of things among\r\nthe Indians bears an important relation to the facts pointed out by C. K.\r\nClarke,[177] of Kingston, Ontario, who found in the Canadian asylums a\r\nlarge number of goitrous patients and one goitrous attendant. The goitrous\r\npatients, who were of long residence, had come from all parts of the\r\ndominion. The size of the goitre was in proportion to the length of the\r\nresidence. It is possible that local influence may have much to do with\r\nthe disease, though it is evident that the insane are much more liable to\r\nit than normal persons. W. B. Fletcher, of Indianapolis, has observed\r\nsimilar frequency as to goitre among the insane there, especially among\r\nthe foreigners and their immediate descendants. Cretinism, according to\r\nMorel, was degeneracy due to a special action which a toxic principle\r\nexercises on a cerebro-spinal system, whether by the air that is breathed\r\nor by the substances ingested in the economy, and which, above all,\r\nappears to have some relation to a soil where predominates the magnesian\r\nlimestone. That the last factor has some influence is shown by the fact\r\nthat goitrous enlargements are encountered in medical practice in Chicago\r\nmuch more frequently than among the corresponding classes in the East. The\r\nwater in Chicago contains magnesium-lime salts, whether it be derived from\r\nthe lake or from the artesian well. The fact, however, that the Indians\r\nand the insane exhibit a tendency to goitre indicates that behind the\r\ninfluence of the soil or of diet lies a neuropathic constitution, whether\r\nthis be inherited or acquired. Cretinism is much more frequent in the\r\nUnited States than was apparent ere the discovery of the value of the\r\nthyroid glands in treatment. Under the stimulus of investigation for cases\r\nin which to try this treatment, medical literature from all parts of the\r\nUnited States has been filled with reports of authenticated cases. Among\r\nthese are scions of families which have been American for more than three\r\ngenerations and which may, therefore, be considered as products of an\r\nAmerican environment. The same condition of things has occurred in both\r\nGreat Britain and on the European continent in districts which, prior to\r\n1890, were supposed to be free from cretinism. This illustrates the\r\nresults of stimulus given investigation in biology rather than increase of\r\nthe disorder.\r\n\r\nThe influence of spoiled maize in producing the mixed skin, nervous and\r\nmental disorder known as pellagra in the Italians, would seem, from the\r\nresults of the researches of Billod,[178] to be chiefly due to the\r\nconjoined effects of unhygienic surroundings, the offspring of climate and\r\nsoil. The fungus on maize (ustilago), like the fungus on rye (ergot),\r\nproduces rather long-lasting neurosis of an epileptic character,\r\nsusceptible to transmission to the offspring of women poisoned by these\r\nfungi. The Italian disease, pellagra, manifests the features one would\r\nexpect from an improper food taken under unhygienic conditions. While this\r\nis undoubtedly exaggerated by the habits of the peasantry in Italy, still\r\nin a lesser degree like effects of food are observable in other races.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the potato diet in degenerating the Irish Celt in\r\ncomparison with the Scottish Celt under the same conditions, is difficult\r\nat present to determine for lack of data. Certainly the descendants of\r\nthis class of Irish Celts rapidly regain a handsome, healthy status under\r\nmixed American diet, even though the hygienic surroundings in the great\r\ncities be not the best. He who has to treat a class of neurasthenics in\r\nwhom starch digestion is impaired finds that a diet of potatoes\r\n(undoubtedly through the auto-intoxication it produces) will increase\r\ncertain nervous symptoms, and hence the tendency to transmission to the\r\nnext generation.\r\n\r\nIn the families of the pioneers in the United States, as well as the\r\nfamilies of farmers in secluded valleys in Norway, Switzerland, and\r\nelsewhere, the influence of monotony of diet, aggravated by monotony of\r\nsurroundings, has undoubtedly produced a large amount of degeneracy. Ray\r\nBrigham of New York, Awl of Ohio, and Patterson of Illinois have shown\r\nthat there is an unusual frequency of insanity in farmers' wives which is\r\nundoubtedly traceable to these conditions. Kiernan, of Chicago, has\r\nreported a case fairly typical of those earlier described by the American\r\nalienists just cited. The first generation was a woman of New England\r\nstock, of tireless energy, to whom work was a pleasure and rest an\r\nabhorrence, and who lived on a farm miles from the town. She did all her\r\nown work and brought up a large family, chiefly on maize, potatoes, and\r\nbread, pork being the meat diet. At 50 this woman removed with her\r\nhusband, who had grown wealthy, to a small country town. Here she\r\nconducted the entire work of the household without a servant. At 52 she\r\nbroke down with neurasthenia, which rapidly passed into periodical gloomy\r\nspells, in one of which she committed suicide. Her youngest daughter, who\r\nhad an asymmetrical face, has the periodical gloomy tendency of the\r\nmother, alternating with periods of restlessness, which evince themselves\r\nin doing unnecessarily the work of the servants and other labours\r\ninconsistent with her husband's social status. She had at times suicidal\r\nand homicidal impulses. She has three children; one exhibits no special\r\nabnormality; the eldest, a boy of eleven, dislikes to play with boys\r\nbecause they are rough, and plays with girls, to whom he is at times\r\nmischievously cruel. He likes to sew and make doll's clothing and purchase\r\ndolls, while there are other indications of sexual abnormality. The\r\nyoungest, a girl, has frequent attacks of epileptic-like fury, although\r\nbetween these she is kind-hearted, good-humoured, and very affectionate.\r\nIn dealing with the question of soil, the factors predisposing to the\r\nattacks of the parasite of malaria have to be taken into consideration;\r\ncertainly the inhabitants of certain malarial districts exhibit all the\r\ncharacteristics of degenerates.\r\n\r\nThe influence of nutrition in producing nervous states likely to be\r\ntransmitted as degeneracy in the offspring are excellently illustrated in\r\nthe nervous disorders due to improper nutrition during youth. This may, as\r\nW. S. Christopher[179] of Chicago has shown, produce all possible neuroses\r\nto which the organism may be liable. Such neuroses relate to--\r\n\r\n  A. Psychic faculties.\r\n\r\n  B. Sensation.\r\n      1. Anaesthesia.\r\n      2. Hyperaesthesia.\r\n      3. Hyperalgia (increased pain sense).\r\n\r\n  C. Heat production.\r\n      1. Elevation of temperature.\r\n      2. Depression of temperature.\r\n\r\n  D. Muscular tissues.\r\n      1. Hypertrophy.\r\n      2. Atrophy.\r\n      3. Paralysis.\r\n      4. Convulsions.\r\n\r\n  E. Skeletal muscles.\r\n      1. General convulsions.\r\n      2. Chorea.\r\n      3. Tetany (toe and finger jerks).\r\n\r\n  F. Pharynx.\r\n      1. Dyspnoea (difficult breathing).\r\n\r\n  G. Oesophagus.\r\n      1. Dysphagia (difficult swallowing).\r\n\r\n  H. Stomach.\r\n      1. Vomiting.\r\n      2. Merycism (rumination).\r\n\r\n  I. Intestines.\r\n      1. Increased peristalsis (movement of bowel).\r\n      2. Decreased peristalsis.\r\n\r\n  J. Larynx.\r\n      1. Dyspnoea.\r\n      2. Laryngismus stridulus (croup spasm).\r\n      3. Chorea.\r\n\r\n  K. Bronchi.\r\n      1. Asthma.\r\n      2. Bronchorrhoea (excessive secretion).\r\n\r\n  L. Bladder.\r\n      1. Incontinence.\r\n      2. Retention.\r\n\r\n  M. Urethra.\r\n      1. Spasmodic stricture.\r\n\r\n  N. Uterus.\r\n      1. Neuralgias.\r\n      2. Spasms.\r\n\r\n  O. Vagina.\r\n      1. Vaginismus (painful spasm).\r\n\r\n  P. Heart.\r\n      1. Chorea.\r\n      2. Disturbance of rate.\r\n      3. Disturbance of rhythm.\r\n\r\n  Q. Secretory organs.\r\n      1. Decrease of secretion.\r\n      2. Modification of composition of secretion.\r\n\r\n  R. Absorptive organs.\r\n\r\n  S. Elaborative organs.\r\n\r\n  T. Respiratory organs. Other than those cited.\r\n\r\n  U. Excretory organs.\r\n\r\n  V. Reproductory organs.\r\n\r\nThose of the genital organs only exist in precocious childhood, while\r\nstill others occur, some occasionally, some very frequently.\r\n\r\nOf the psychic neuroses, perhaps the commonest are the night terrors,\r\nwhich occur in ill-nourished children with great frequency. Hyperesthesia\r\n(or increased sensitiveness) is a starvation neurosis occurring especially\r\nin unrecognised scurvy. Variations of temperature, both increased and\r\nsubnormal, occur in children suffering from evident in-nutrition.\r\n\r\nOf the starvation neuroses, the commonest are muscular convulsions.\r\nNaturally enough, any muscle or any group of muscles may be affected, and\r\nthe manifestations may present all the varieties of convulsive movements\r\nto which muscles are liable. Probably no child whose nutrition is perfect\r\never has general convulsions except as the result of actual brain disease\r\nor at the onset of some infectious process where the convulsion takes the\r\nplace of the initial chill of the adult. The so-called reflex convulsions\r\noccur only in children whose nutrition is below par. In a rickety child\r\nthe slight irritation produced by an erupting tooth may be sufficient to\r\nweaken the mechanism which checks explosive action, just as in the same\r\nchild it may be the determining cause of bronchorrhoea. In the healthy\r\nchild teething can cause no such effect. Both these manifestations, the\r\nconvulsions and the bronchorrhoea, are starvation neuroses. In such\r\nchildren many other trivial conditions may weaken the controlling\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nIn older children chorea, whatever be its cause, is evidently connected\r\nwith the developmental process. The beneficial effects in chorea of\r\nabsolute rest in bed and forced feeding are a matter of common\r\nobservation. Dysphagia as a neurosis in children is uncommon. Vomiting and\r\ndiarrhoea occur so frequently in infants from a wide variety of causes,\r\nthat it is very difficult to say when they are merely starvation neuroses.\r\nIn rickets, diarrhoea often occurs, with no adequate explanation in the\r\nconditions present in the intestinal canal, and which is an essential\r\nfeature of the disease itself.\r\n\r\nLaryngismus stridulus is a very common manifestation of muscular\r\nstarvation neurosis. Spasmodic asthma occurs in ill-nourished children.\r\nIncontinence of urine in older children is often a starvation neurosis.\r\n\r\nThe younger the child the more rapid are its processes of growth. Hence in\r\ninfants the results of defective nutrition are quickly manifested, and the\r\ncurative effects of food arranged to supply the nutritive deficiencies\r\nalso become apparent very soon. In older children with more stable tissues\r\na defective food supply is longer borne without apparent effect; but, on\r\nthe other hand, the beneficial effect of an antidotal diet becomes\r\napparent only after a prolonged use.\r\n\r\nThe relatively simple diet of the infant makes it easy to discover the\r\nparticular kind of food which is supplied in sufficient quantity, and\r\nmakes the supply of the deficiency comparatively easy. But in older\r\nchildren with a more varied diet the defect is less readily discovered and\r\nless readily supplied.\r\n\r\nThe effects of climate, soil, and food in the production of degeneracy are\r\nfirst shown in the causation of general loss of nerve tone in the\r\nancestor, often with special local expressions. This loss of nerve tone\r\nmay show itself in the offspring by any type of degeneracy from nutritive\r\ndefect to loss of moral tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSCHOOL STRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nLike all factors of degeneracy, school strain evinces itself in a systemic\r\nnervous exhaustion manifest along lines of least resistance, as in the\r\nneuroses of Christopher. The first types of his neuroses are due to\r\noverstrain of certain territories related with memory, as contrasted with\r\ndiminished use of the association fibres connecting these. As Schopenhauer\r\nhas excellently observed, man is one-third intellect and two-thirds will,\r\nand much of this last two-thirds is the result of training. Capacity for\r\ntraining may be greater in one individual than another, because of\r\ninherited or congenital deficiencies. It is, as Sully[180] remarks, \"a\r\nhappy circumstance in healthy children that that most prolific excitant of\r\nfear, the presentation of something new and uncanny, is also provocative\r\nof curiosity, with its impulse to look and examine. A very tiny child, on\r\nfirst making acquaintance with some form of physical pain, as a bump on\r\nthe head, will deliberately repeat the experience by knocking his head\r\nagainst something as if experimenting and watching the effect. A clearer\r\ncase of curiosity overpowering fear is that of a child who, after pulling\r\nthe tail of a cat in a bush and getting scratched, proceeded to dive into\r\nthe bush again. Still more interesting here are gradual transitions from\r\nactual fear, before the new and strange, to bold inspection. The child who\r\nwas frightened by her Japanese doll insisted on seeing it every day. The\r\nbehaviour of one of these small persons on the arrival at the house of a\r\nstrange dog, of a dark foreigner or some other startling novelty is a\r\npretty and amusing sight. The first overpowering timidity, the shrinking\r\nback to the mother's breast, followed by curious peers, then by bolder\r\noutstretchings of head and arms, mark the stage by which curiosity and\r\ninterest gain on fear, and finally leave it far behind. Very soon the\r\nsmall, timorous creatures will grow into bold adventurers. They will make\r\nplaythings of the alarming animals and of the alarming shadows too. Later\r\non still perhaps they will love nothing so much as to probe the awful\r\nmysteries of gunpowder.\"\r\n\r\nIn degenerate children, because of deficiencies of proper\r\ninter-association of the memory territories in the brain, healthy\r\ncuriosity, and the instinct of sheltering are deficient, so that states of\r\nuncertainty, producing terror, result. These become permanent in after\r\nlife, even when training as an adult is strongly antagonistic to them.\r\n\r\nThis is illustrated, as Harriet C. B. Alexander has shown,[181] in George\r\nEliot, who during childhood \"suffered from a low general state of health\r\nand great susceptibility to terror at night, and the liability to have all\r\nher soul become a quivering fear,\" which remained during life. She had\r\nperiods of depression and vertex headache, which latter gave place to\r\nsick headache, often attended with rheumatoid phenomena. \"She was an\r\nawkward girl, reserved and serious far beyond her years, but observant,\r\nand addicted to the habit of sitting in corners and watching her elders.\"\r\nFear of the unknown in childhood, seemingly a reversion to the fear of the\r\nunknown of savages, tends, like it, to produce occult belief. Despite the\r\nGerman rationalism of George Eliot, such fear found utterance in her\r\n_Behind the Veil_, a mystically occult contrast with her novels and with\r\nthe positivism which was her religion. Theoretically the philosophy of\r\nGeorge Eliot should have destroyed much mysticism, yet as a survival of\r\n\"night terrors\" it came to the surface. A very vivid autobiographical\r\nnarrative of night-terrors and similar nervous phenomena in the childhood\r\nof a distinguished man of letters will be found in Horatio Brown's _Life\r\nof John Addington Symonds_.\r\n\r\nSchool over-pressure in certain respects checks, even in well-developed\r\nminds, the transition from the terror of the unknown of childhood into the\r\ncalm of maturity. Morbid fears, imperative conceptions, and imperative\r\nacts which torture the individual during an otherwise healthy career\r\nunquestionably originate in the early periods of life.\r\n\r\nDegenerate children, as Kiernan[182] remarks, early manifest decided\r\nneurotic excitability, and tend to neuroses at physiologic crises like the\r\nfirst and second dentition, and the onset and close of puberty. Slight\r\nphysical or mental perturbation is followed by sleeplessness, delirium,\r\nhallucinations, &c. Hyperaesthesia and excessive reaction to pleasant or\r\noffensive impressions exist. Vasomotor instability is present, pallor,\r\nblushing, palpitations or pre-cardial anxiety result from trivial moral or\r\nphysical excitants. There is no precocity or aberration of the sexual\r\ninstinct. The disposition is irritable. The grasshopper is a burden.\r\nPsychic pain arises from the most trivial cause, and finds expression in\r\nemotional outbursts. Sympathies and antipathies are equally intense. The\r\nmental life swings between periods of exaltation and depression,\r\nalternating with brief epochs of healthy indifference. Egotism is supreme,\r\nand morality absent or perverted. This absence or perversion is often\r\nconcealed under the guise of moral superiority, religiosity, or cant.\r\nVanity and jealous suspiciousness are common. The intellect and temper are\r\nexceedingly irregular. Monotonously feeble, scanty ideation passes readily\r\ninto seeming brilliance, even to the extent of hallucinations. But ideas\r\nare barren as a rule, because generated so rapidly as to destroy each\r\nother ere they pass into action. Energy fails ere aught can be completed.\r\nThe inability to distinguish between desires and facts produces seeming\r\nmendacity. The will in its apparent exuberance, its capricious energy, and\r\ninnate futility, matches and distorts the one-sided talent or whimsical\r\ngenius which may exist. The whole of this mental state may not be present.\r\nThe tendency to introspection, to morbid fear, to gloom, to\r\nhallucinations, to alternations of depression and exaltation, may occur in\r\na degenerate child in whom has been otherwise preserved that secondary ego\r\nwhich is the latest and greatest acquirement of the race.\r\n\r\nIn the same class, according to George Parkman,[183] an American alienist\r\nof more than eighty years ago, brilliant talents, astonishing facility of\r\nreceiving and communicating ideas often appear suddenly at puberty,\r\nespecially in females, to be later followed by mediocrity, disappointment,\r\nand supineness.\r\n\r\nThese degenerate children have a tendency, as C. F. Folsom[184] remarks,\r\nto manifest aberrant tendencies at the periods of stress, which may, in\r\nFolsom's judgment, be congenital, or due to early interference with normal\r\nbrain development. These show themselves in childhood and infancy by\r\nirregularity or disturbed sleep, irritability, apprehension, strange\r\nideas, great sensitiveness to external impressions, high temperature,\r\ndelirium or convulsions from slight causes, disagreeable dreams and\r\nvisions, romancing, intense feeling, periodic headache, muscular\r\ntwitching, capricious appetite, and great intolerance of stimulants and\r\nnarcotics. At puberty developmental anomalies, and not infrequently\r\nperverted sexual instincts, are observed in both sexes. During adolescence\r\nthere is often excessive shyness or bravado, always introspection and\r\nself-consciousness, and sometimes abeyance or absence of the sexual\r\ninstinct, which, however, is frequently of extraordinary intensity. The\r\nimitative and imaginative faculties may be quick. The affections or\r\nemotions are vehement but shallow. Vehement dislikes are formed, and\r\nintense personal attachments result in extraordinary friendships, which\r\nnot seldom swing around suddenly into bitter enmity or indifference. The\r\npassions are unduly a force in the character, which lacks will power. The\r\nindividual's higher brain centres are not well inhibited, and he dashes\r\nabout like a ship without a rudder, fairly well if the winds be fair and\r\nthe seas be calm, but dependent on the elements for the character and the\r\ntime of the final wreck. Invention, poetry, music, artistic taste,\r\nphilanthropy, intensity, and originality, are sometimes of a higher order\r\namong these persons, but desultory, half-finished work and shiftlessness\r\nare much more common. With many of them concentrated, sustained effort,\r\nand attempts to keep them to it are impossible. Their common-sense\r\nperception of the relations of life, executive or business faculty and\r\njudgment are seldom well developed. The memory is now and then\r\nextraordinary. They are apt to be self-conscious, egotistic, and morbidly\r\nconscious. They easily become victims of insomnia, neurasthenia,\r\nhypochondria, neuroticism, hysteria, or insanity. They offend against the\r\nproprieties of life and commit crime with less cause or provocation than\r\nother persons. While many of them are among the most gifted and attractive\r\npeople in their community, the majority are otherwise, and possess an\r\nuncommon capacity for making fools of themselves, and of being a nuisance\r\nto their friends and of little use to the world.\r\n\r\nThese conditions occur from heredity in degenerates, but, as Francis\r\nWarner[185] remarks, while \"it is very common to see disordered conditions\r\nof the nervous system in children with defective construction of body,\r\nthese nerve disturbances may also be seen in children with normal\r\nconstruction of body. Such signs result from the disorder, produced by\r\nspecial circumstances, aiding as well as producing defect which results\r\nfrom, or in the next generation becomes, defect in original construction.\r\nAmong the signs of fatigue in children is the slight amount of force\r\nexpended in movement, often with asymmetry of balance in the body. The\r\nfatigued centres may be unequally exhausted; spontaneous finger twitches\r\nlike those of younger children may be seen, and slight movements may be\r\nexcited by noises. The head is often held on one side. The arms when\r\nextended are not held horizontally. Usually the left is lower. The face is\r\nno evidence of bodily nutrition. It may be well nourished, yet the body be\r\nthin. Three per cent. of the children seen in school are below par in\r\nnutrition. These children are of lower general constitutional power. They\r\ntend to an ill-nourished condition under the stress of life, and many\r\ncases of mental excitement which, while they render them sharper mentally,\r\nmilitate against general nutrition.\"\r\n\r\nColin A. Scott has found corroborative evidences of similar effects of\r\nstrain in the children of the New England and Illinois schools.\r\n\r\nThese systemic nervous exhaustions may, as W. S. Christopher, of Chicago,\r\nhas shown (in remarks on neuroses already cited), take unexpected local\r\ndirections, especially involving, in accordance with the general law of\r\nreversal, evolution or degeneracy checks on excessive action. Among the\r\nconditions produced by school strain of serious consequence in after-life\r\nare headaches, usually charged to anaemia or neurasthenia. These headaches,\r\nas Sachs,[186] of New York, has shown, usually appear after emotional\r\nexcitement or fatiguing ordeal. There are other symptoms expressive of\r\nneurasthenia, such as slight tremor of the tongue and fingers and\r\nexaggeration of the deep reflexes, but, above all, the very persistent\r\nvertex headache, and the child's description of pressure or heat there. In\r\nchildren emotional conditions, school strain, rivalry between class-mates,\r\nare as liable to produce neurasthenia as are the more serious struggles\r\nfor existence in later life. These headaches may pass very readily at\r\nperiods of stress into migraine. The vertigo characteristic of migraine is\r\nnot rarely found in the neurasthenic headache of childhood. What is true\r\nof migraine is also true of epilepsy. The tremors, &c., accompanying\r\nneurasthenic headache become the convulsions of epilepsy. G. B. Fowler\r\nreports a case emphasising very clearly the position of Christopher. It\r\nwas that of a seven-year-old boy of mushroom growth and hothouse culture.\r\nHe began every day before breakfast with an hour at Spanish, and until\r\nthree in the afternoon was unceasingly occupied with French, German,\r\nmusic, and the ordinary school curriculum. This policy, initiated four\r\nyears before, the pressure being gradually increased, had been maintained\r\nalmost without interruption. The child had consequently developed into a\r\nsort of phonograph, capable of starting automatic expressions which\r\nafforded much entertainment to visitors, and gave the ambitious father\r\ngreat hope and comfort. Under such conditions it is not to be wondered at\r\nthat something gave way, and, fortunately for the brain, it was the\r\nsphincter of the anus. When this deplorable occurrence first took place\r\nthe child was sharply reprimanded; the accident repeating itself, however,\r\ntwo or three times weekly, and later about once a day, more pronounced\r\nmeasures were instituted. The boy was often severely flogged, deprived of\r\nliberty, luxuries, &c., yet without avail. The lower bowel was perfectly\r\nnormal. The sphincter was tight, grasped the finger with the usual\r\nfirmness, and there were no sources of irritation about the anus. The\r\nabnormal conditions under which the child had been living very naturally\r\nat the outset were the cause of the difficulty. Cessation of the\r\npunishment and release from books was ordered. The result was\r\nsatisfactory. In three weeks the involuntary discharge became gradually\r\nless frequent, and finally ceased altogether.\r\n\r\nMental strain produces precisely similar effects on the nerve control of\r\nthe stomach. All types of nervous disturbances of the stomach--merycism\r\n(cud-chewing), bulimia (ox appetite), acoria (incapacity for getting\r\nenough)--result, as Ewald[187] has shown, from nerve strain, and increase\r\nthis through auto-intoxication.\r\n\r\nThe sphincter of bladder often gives way, and is a very frequent\r\nexpression of nervous exhaustion in the child, often increased by the\r\neffects of nerve strain on the kidneys, which do their work of\r\npurification imperfectly, while excreting nearly pure water. The enormous\r\nquantity of clear urine passed during worry is a generally recognised\r\nexpression of such strain. This nerve-strain interference with the\r\npurifying work of the kidneys leads to increased strain on the liver and\r\nother glands, whence result migraine, the uric acid states, rheumatisms,\r\nand the other perversions of nutrition. Nerve-strain on either liver,\r\nbowel, or other glands, has similar secondary effects on the kidneys. In\r\npart this is an organ degeneracy in function whereby man's liver and\r\nkidneys do the work of the sauropsidal liver and kidneys.\r\n\r\nAmong the nutritive disturbances resulting from nerve-strain is the fatty\r\nanaemia of Weir Mitchell, the juvenile obesity of Fere and others. This is\r\ngenerally associated with the uric acid states which so often result from\r\nschool strain. The apparent improvement shown in increased weight leads to\r\nincreased strain, and many of these fat victims of school over-pressure\r\nenter insane hospitals as puberty lunatics.\r\n\r\nOther effects of the nutritive disturbances produced by school strain are\r\nlocal irritations about the sexual organs. These may arise from irritation\r\nby uric acid of the mouth of the bladder in boys, or of the vagina and\r\nbladder in girls. Neurotic persons are liable to nerve storms, which\r\nexpress themselves in emotional displays or restlessness or nagging\r\ntendencies. These often coincide with the uric acid tendency to express\r\nitself in \"storms,\" like other periodical phenomena of the nervous system.\r\nIn consequence, \"sexual storms\" result in neuropaths, whether the\r\nneuropathy be inherited or acquired. Local genital organ irritation leads\r\nto scratching. From this are produced \"masturbation storms,\" which the\r\nsubject loathes but cannot control. These occur also from the direct\r\neffects of constipation, as well as from the worms and other parasites\r\nwhich constipation fosters in the bowel. Teachers, by compelling children\r\nto retain urine through fear of masturbation, often lead to what they\r\nintend to prevent. At the outset masturbation and sexual explosions are\r\noften a physical expression of school strain destitute of moral\r\nsignificance. They are removable by removing the school strain and its\r\nconsequences. If strengthened by protracted existence they intensify\r\ndegeneracy due to school strain.\r\n\r\nThe states of imperfect nutrition, resultant from nerve strains on gland\r\nfunction, in this way and in others, interfere with the proper evolution\r\nof puberty and the involutional changes at the \"change of life,\" which\r\noccurs in both sexes. The conditions of \"nervous cough,\" of so-called\r\n\"catarrh,\" and its ally, bronchorrhoea, are often found as expressions of\r\nthe systemic exhaustion from school strain, and are treated as purely\r\nlocal conditions.\r\n\r\nSchool strain, therefore, produces, like all the acquired factors of\r\ndegeneracy, a systemic nervous exhaustion which may be expressed either in\r\ngeneral neuropathy or hysteria after puberty, or in the tropho-neuroses,\r\nlike gout and allied states, or in epilepsy or arterial change,\r\npredisposing to rupture of arteries at periods of stress, with resultant\r\nconvulsions and paralysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE DEGENERATE CRANIUM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cranium or skull is a development in part of the vertebrae or bones\r\nforming the backbone, and in part of dermal or membranous bones, which of\r\nold in reptiles, as in the alligator to-day, formed the protective armour\r\nof the skin of the head. As the head end of the spinal cord of the\r\nlancelet developed, the cartilage enclosing it developed to protect it.\r\nThis was the earlier evolution. Later, another skull developed in\r\nconnection with this. The cranium or skull therefore has, as Minot\r\nremarks,[188] a double origin, or, rather, there are two skulls which were\r\noriginally distinct. In evolution from the lowest fish to the highest\r\nmammal, and in the embryonic development of man, these become united.\r\n\r\nThe primary skull, as already stated, is practically an extension of the\r\nvertebrae, which send side outgrowths to cover the brain as the backbone\r\ncovers the spinal cord. This primary skull extended in front of the\r\nnotochord (the spinal cord of the human embryo, and the permanent spinal\r\ncord of the lancelet), where it gave off two trabeculae cranii or front\r\nskull plates. Behind, the primary skull or chondrocranium gives off two\r\noccipal or rear skull plates. It gives off also two plates midway between\r\nthe trabeculae and occipitals, which, as they gradually enclose the\r\nprimitive hearing apparatus, the otocysts (permanent in fish, and\r\nembryonic in man), are called periotic capsules. This primary skull is at\r\nfirst cartilaginous, as in sharks. With the increase in the size of the\r\nbrain in evolution and in human embryology, this cartilaginous primary\r\nskull became insufficient to roof over the brain, and thus resulted gaps\r\nin it. The fontanelles, or soft places at the top, sides, and back of the\r\nhead of the new-born child, are the remains of this failure of the\r\nchondrocranium, or primary skull, to cover the gains of the nervous system\r\nin the struggle for existence. This deficiency, resultant on advance in\r\nevolution, would have been a long-standing serious block to further\r\nadvance, were it not that the skin of the mammal retained a function\r\ninherited from the reptiles and bony fish.\r\n\r\nThese cavities were filled by dermal bones, which, at first serving merely\r\nas armour in the skin of the head, came to be protectors of the nervous\r\nsystem. The following bones represent these dermal bones in the embryonic\r\nhuman skull: The frontals, which form the chief part of the forehead; the\r\nsutures, or dovetails, of these normally disappear in the adult, so that\r\nthe forehead seems to be but one bone. This union may not occur (Fig. 7),\r\nas in the case of the philosopher Kant, who had a frontal suture all his\r\nlife. The dovetails are replaced by solid bone, through a process called\r\nsynostosis. In the case of the frontal bone it is normal, and in the line\r\nof advance. Elsewhere in the skull it is often an expression of defect\r\nwhich may give rise to various cranial states which are either absolutely\r\ndegenerate in type or degenerate only when occurring in certain races. The\r\nparietals and interparietals are also dermal bones which are united by\r\nsynostosis to form the parietals or side bones of the normal adult skull.\r\nThe nasal bones which, together with the vomer, form the nose, are\r\nlikewise dermal bones, and so are the pterygoids and palatines. The\r\nmaxillaries and praemaxillaries, which, with the mandibles, form the jaws,\r\nare dermal bones. The mandibles, however, are in part derived from the\r\nchondrocranium.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWith rise in evolution, and during the progress of human embryonic\r\ndevelopment, these bones become fewer through their early gristly union or\r\ntheir synostosis. The openings in the skull resultant on the deficiencies\r\nin the chondrocranium are larger in the sauropsida (birds and reptiles)\r\nthan in the ichthyopsida (amphibious and fish); in the monotremata\r\n(egg-laying mammals) than in the sauropsida; in the marsupials (pouched\r\nmammals) than in the monotremata, and in the higher mammals than in the\r\nmarsupials. The development of the brain therefore depends on the growing\r\nand expanding power of the secondary skull formed by the dermal bones.\r\nThese, considered as bones, are degenerate from the high type of the\r\nvertebrae, and are a mere reminiscence of that outer skeleton whereby early\r\nfish and reptiles emulated the lobster. The influence of any check to\r\ndevelopment such as produces degeneracy, is exerted first on the\r\ndevelopment of the bone itself, and finally on the relation to other bones\r\nby dovetailing.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the general laws governing growth, deficiency in one\r\nplace is apt to result in increase elsewhere. The brain-protective\r\nfunction of the dermal bones being later in development than their old\r\narmour function, is apt to be checked by degeneracy in two ways; in the\r\nfirst the bone does not grow in size or sufficiently to unite with its\r\nfellows, or this growth occurs only for the benefit of the bone itself,\r\nthrough Spencer's law of individuation, so that union with the other bones\r\noccurs too early for the benefit of the organism as a whole. To the\r\nfactors underlying this is due the non-increase in intellect after puberty\r\nwhich occurs in the higher apes, and in some of the lower races of men.\r\n\r\nThese checks also tend to the nutritional benefit of the older primary\r\nskull, whence result the irregularities in development that constitute so\r\nmany of the stigmata of the degenerate cranium. The sutures sometimes do\r\nnot form because sufficient gristle is not produced to fill the gaps.\r\n(Fig. 8.) These secondary gaps are often filled by new dermal bones called\r\nWormian. Sometimes this deficiency coexists with too early synostosis\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDegenerate skulls have therefore been divided from the standpoint of these\r\nvarious unions (by synostosis or otherwise) and non-unions of the sutures,\r\non the principle that premature synostosis of a suture produces shortness\r\nof the diameter, perpendicular to the direction of the obliterated\r\nsuture.[189] The bones stop growing prematurely at the seat of the\r\nsynostosis, but the unaffected borders continue growing. The following\r\ntypes result on this principle:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Simple macrocephaly (largeness of head). (_a_) Hydrocephaly (water in\r\nthe head. Fig. 9.) (_b_) Kephalones (all heads. Fig. 10), without\r\nhydrocephaly. These two conditions result from the inability of the dermal\r\nbones to fill at the proper period the gaps in the chondrocranium. Neither\r\nof these denotes complete intellectual degeneracy on the one hand, nor\r\nvast intellect on the other. Cuvier was a case of healed-up hydrocephalus,\r\nwhence his large brain and skull. In a case of kephalones observed by\r\nKiernan there was a brain-weight of 68 ounces. The patient was an\r\nimbecile, practically unteachable.[190] Both these conditions denote deep\r\ndegeneracy, which, however, may find expression elsewhere than in the\r\nmoral sense or intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.]\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Simple microcephaly (smallness of head. Fig. 11) or nannocephaly\r\n(dwarf head). As a rule these are found among idiots, but much has been\r\ndone by training, even for them. Many seemingly great intellects, however,\r\nhave heads approaching, if not reaching this type.[191] Des Cartes,\r\nFoscolo, and Schumann had sub-microcephaly. The poet Shelley had a head\r\nbelonging very nearly to this category, but while he exhibited many\r\nstigmata of degeneracy, that of intellectual deficiency was wanting. This\r\ntype of skull, however, is usually associated with deep degeneracy. It\r\nrepresents in man the condition underlying the premature suture-closing\r\nwhich occurs in the ape. It sometimes may exist with considerable\r\nintellect, as in the case of Donizetti. Sometimes this suture-closing\r\ndirectly prevents brain growth. This condition is rarer than many surgeons\r\nadmit, but it does occur, as witness the cases of Vico, Malebranche, and\r\nClement VI. The fact that these three fractured their skulls in infancy\r\nsaved them from being imbeciles and idiots like their brothers, sisters,\r\nand cousins.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Dolichocephaly (long-headedness. Fig. 12). (_a_) Upper middle\r\nsynostosis. (1) Simple dolichocephaly is due to synostosis of the\r\nsagittal, or antero-posterior suture of the skull. Whether this be due to\r\ndegeneracy or not depends entirely on the race in which it occurs. The\r\nultra-dolichocephaly of Daniel O'Connell was due, in Kiernan's opinion, to\r\nhis birth in an Irish district settled by dolichocephalics. Undoubtedly\r\ndolichocephaly is tending to mesocephaly (medium size of head). Even the\r\nnegro, generally regarded by ethnologists as dolichocephalic, is tending\r\nin this direction, as numerous observations of my own show.\r\nDolichocephaly, however, while it does not demonstrate, suggests\r\ndegeneracy, since it seems to be a disappearing type of skull. The changes\r\nin American families in this particular indicate this. (2) Sphenocephaly\r\n(wedge-shape of head. Fig. 13) is due to synostosis of the sagittal\r\nsuture, with compensatory growth in the region of the large fontanelle.\r\n(_b_) Dolichocephalic states, resulting from inferior lateral synostosis\r\nare: (1) Leptocephaly (narrowness of head), due to synostosis of the\r\nfrontal and sphenoid bones. (2) Klinocephaly (saddle-shaped head) is due\r\nto synostosis of the parietal bones with the greater wings of the\r\nsphenoid, or of the parietal with the squamous portion of the temporal\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Brachycephaly (shortness of head. Fig. 14). The pure type like pure\r\ndolichocephaly is not necessarily by itself evidence of degeneracy, as it\r\nmay represent race. It is, however, a disappearing type of skull, and\r\nhence should lead to critical examination. In the case of the philosopher\r\nKant his ultra-brachycephaly could not be charged to race, since he sprang\r\nfrom dolichocephalic Scotch on one side and dolichocephalic Germans on the\r\nother. (_a_) Posterior stenosis. (1) Pachycephaly (thickness of head) is\r\ndue to synostosis of the parietal bone with the occipital. (2) Oxycephaly\r\n(sugar-loaf head) is due to synostosis of the parietal bones and the\r\noccipital with compensatory growth of the region of the anterior\r\nfontanelle; a variety of this is acrocephaly (spire head). (_b_) Upper,\r\nanterior, and lateral synostosis. (1) Platycephaly (flat head. Fig. 15),\r\nor chaemacephaly, is due to extensive synostosis of the temporal bones with\r\nthe parietal. Kant, in addition to his cranial stigmata, had this\r\ncondition. (2) Trochocephaly (roundness of head) is due to partial\r\nsynostosis of the frontals and parietals in the centre of the coronal\r\nsuture. (3) Plagiocephaly (wry head. Fig. 16) is due to unilateral\r\nsynostosis of the frontal and parietal bones. (_c_) Brachycephaly due to\r\ninferior medium synostosis. Simple brachycephaly is due to early\r\nsynostosis of the nasal and sphenoid.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo these should be added kyphocephaly (lump head), due to synostosis of\r\nthe posterior part of the squamous portion of the temporal and the\r\nparietal bones with Wormian bones in the lambdoid fissure. Tapeisocephaly\r\n(low head) is due to synostosis of the great wings of the sphenoid with\r\nthe frontal. Scaphocephaly (boat-shaped head. Fig. 17) was a term applied\r\nby Von Baer to skulls which are very narrow and compressed at the sides,\r\nand in which there is no trace of the sagittal suture, but its region is\r\nso elevated that the skull cap has the form of a keel boat bottom upward.\r\nTrigonocephaly (triangular head) is a variety of scaphocephaly in which\r\ndepression occurs in place of the keel. Sir Walter Scott had a skull in\r\nwhich premature closure of the sagittal suture produced the appearance of\r\nscaphocephaly, but compensation for this elsewhere produced a decidedly\r\ndifferent type. Scott presented neurotic phenomena during youth, albeit\r\nthe brain disease from which he died had anything but a degenerate origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMorton and Catlin claim that while the artificial distortions of the\r\ncranium may play a part in developing synostosis these have no effect upon\r\nthe intellectual functions. It has been stated further that there are no\r\nmental data to show the effect of artificial malformation of the child's\r\nhead during development. Frederick Peterson expresses the opinion that\r\nthis practice only exists among the lower races of mankind. In this he is\r\nin decided error, since, as Barnard Davis pointed out many years ago, the\r\npractice is far more widespread than is usually suspected. It was common\r\nall over Europe, was practised by the Turanians, by the Slaves, by the\r\nScandinavians, Anglo-Saxons, and Celts. Less than half a century ago\r\nFoville[192] proved that the nurses in Normandy were still giving\r\nchildren's heads a sugar-loaf shape by bandages and a tight cap. In\r\nBritanny they preferred to press it round. In those districts Foville\r\nfound that not only congenital cranial irregularities of all types, but\r\nepilepsy, idiocy, and insanity were exceedingly frequent. As customs like\r\nthese survive in folklore long after the original superstition which gave\r\nthem birth, it is exceedingly probable that such crop out in descendants\r\nof these races to the present day, to confront the anthropologist with\r\nsome remarkable crania. Tylor[193] is of opinion that without respecting\r\nthe repressive action of the Government, the Bretons and Normans secretly\r\ncontinue this practice. Despite the labours of Foville these people openly\r\ndefied the Government for ten years.\r\n\r\nCertain conditions of the occiput have been described as associated with\r\ndegeneracy. As Obici[194] and Dei Vecchio[195] have shown, the occipital\r\ncondyle, in man normally convex, abnormally varies between two extremes,\r\nthe flat and angular condyles. The flat condyle indicates a degenerative\r\ntype. In the angular condyle the anterior face is derived from that\r\nportion of the basi-occipital nucleus that normally takes part in the\r\nformation of the anterior condyle region; the posterior face forms the\r\nembryonal germ of the occipital.\r\n\r\nThe occipital of the adult is the final outcome of the fusion of an\r\nuncertain number of vertebrae. The occipital bone in man is practically\r\nmade up of five bones, union between which does not occur completely until\r\nthe fifth or sixth year. The deficiencies in the chondrocranium appear in\r\nthe occipital bone, which requires a small portion of the dermal bone to\r\ncomplete it on each side.\r\n\r\nThe variability of the occipital bone which, as just shown, is so\r\nfrequently associated with all forms of degeneracy, is still better\r\nunderstood when we remember that it is of vertebral character. The\r\ninvesting mass of the head and of the notochord is the skeleton of the\r\noccipital bone. Between this skeleton and the pituitary body the important\r\nportion of the brain formed by the occipital lobes takes its origin. As\r\nthese lobes are practically, as Spitzka has shown, the great centres of\r\nsense and other inter-associations it is not astonishing that their\r\nimperfect development should be accompanied by changes in the occipital\r\nbone. As Crochley Clapham, Mickle, and Spitzka have shown, a flat occiput\r\nis common in imbecility and moral insanity. It has been found quite\r\nfrequently in \"reasoning maniacs\" by Campagne. The proper development of\r\nthe occiput influences the proper development of association tracts which\r\nserve as a balance wheel to the individual. The proper development of the\r\noccipital bone is, moreover, connected with the proper development of the\r\ntwo last vertebrae, which like it are losing their vertebral\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DEGENERATE FACE AND NOSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the face depends, as I have already shown, upon the\r\nenlargement and fusion of the mouth and nose cavities, and upon the later\r\npartial separation of the nose and mouth and the nose cavities, leaving\r\nthe posterior nose open. It depends further upon the growth and\r\nspecialisation of the face region, of which the elongation is the most\r\nprominent indication, and finally upon the development of a prominent\r\nexternal nose. The relations of face to cranium in embryology have already\r\nbeen described. When the medullary tube of the notochord enlarges to form\r\nthe brain the end of the head bends over to make room for that\r\nenlargement. The bending of the head carries the mouth plate, which is to\r\nbe the mouth, over to the front of the head. The changes which develop the\r\nmouth cavity are the growth of the brain and the increase in size of the\r\nheart cavity, which expand to the front, leaving the mouth cavity between\r\nthem. The mouth cavity represents two gill-slits united in the front line.\r\nThe nose is formed from two olfactory plates situated just in front of the\r\nmouth and in contact with the fore-brain. These olfactory plates grow in\r\nsize by the increase of tissue, and the resulting pits pass away from the\r\nbrain. At first these pits, although widely separated by what is called\r\nthe nasal process, communicate freely with the mouth. The nasal process\r\nincludes the origin of the future nose and of the future intermaxillary\r\nregion of the upper lip.\r\n\r\nThe human face is modified backward from the vertebrate type. It is an\r\nadditional illustration of the degeneracy of a series of related\r\nstructures for the benefit of the organism as a whole. The progress of\r\ndevelopment of the face in the vertebrates is checked in man. First, as\r\nMinot remarks,[196] because the upright position renders it unnecessary to\r\nbend the head as in quadrupeds. Second, because the enormous cerebral\r\ndevelopment has rendered an enlargement of the brain cavity necessary.\r\nThis has taken place by extending the cavity over the nose region as well\r\nas by enlarging the whole skull. Third, because the development of the\r\nface is arrested at an embryonic stage; the production of a long snout\r\nbeing really an advance of development which does not take place in man.\r\nFrom what has been said of the relations of the dermal bones to the nose\r\nand face in the chapter on the skull, it will be obvious that these must\r\nfollow the same laws as to degeneracy as the skull itself. These checks\r\nfrom degeneracy in arrest of development are apt to affect most obviously\r\nthe unilateral development of the face. From this results the exaggerated\r\nasymmetry so frequently observed.\r\n\r\nJacob Baumler, the founder of the Zoar community of the United States, a\r\nreligious fanatic, had a very marked asymmetry of the face and the mind\r\nof a degenerate. His orbits were unequal, one being exceedingly large and\r\nthe other correspondingly small.\r\n\r\nThe human face at birth is so near that of the monkeys that if only the\r\nheads of both were exposed to view at birth it would be difficult for a\r\ncasual observer to distinguish one from the other. Cope[197] has made the\r\nfollowing classification of the head and face for comparative study: The\r\nrelative size of the cerebral to the facial regions, the prominence of the\r\nforehead, the prominence of the superciliary regions, the prominence of\r\nthe alveolar borders of the jaws, the prominence and width of the chin,\r\nthe relation of length to width of the skull, the prominence of the\r\ncheek-bones, the form of the nose, the relative size of the orbits and\r\neyes, the size of the mouth and lips.\r\n\r\nAt birth in the infant ape the facial region of the skull is smaller than\r\nin the adult, the forehead is more prominent, the superciliary ridges are\r\nmore prominent, the edges of the jaws are more prominent, the chin is\r\nless, while the cheek-bones are more prominent, the nose is without a\r\nbridge and has short and flat cartilages, the face is flattened, the\r\norbits and eyes are smaller and closer together, the mouth is small and\r\nthe lips thin.\r\n\r\nIn the typical infant child as he begins to develop the cerebral part of\r\nthe skull predominates over the facial more than in the adult, the\r\nsuperciliary ridges are not developed, the alveolar borders are not\r\nprominent, the cheek-bones are not prominent, the nose is without a bridge\r\nand the cartilages are flat and generally short, the eyes are larger. In\r\nthis last particular the human infant resembles the lemurs and thus\r\nretains an embryonic tendency. In some degenerates this tendency remains\r\nunchecked, and the result is unusually large orbits as in Fig. 18. In\r\nother instances the human foetus passes through this lemurian stage to\r\nreach and even exceed the anthropoid in smallness and closeness together.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn determining a standard by which to measure the face two principles come\r\ninto play: the general principle of evolution, and also that aesthetic\r\nprinciple governing profile, which has practically obtained supremacy,\r\nafter long struggles for existence, from the Egyptian period of the first\r\ndynasty until its final acceptance by the Greeks, as shown, for instance,\r\nin the Apollo Belvedere. Indeed, so nearly does the modern standard\r\napproximate to the Greek, that Kingsley,[198] speaking of modern profiles,\r\nremarks that if he were to describe the American type he should be as much\r\ninclined to give that name to the form of features of the Apollo Belvedere\r\nas any other, since it is quite universal, distinctive, and possesses the\r\nsame elements of beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong Aryan-speaking races this type would be accepted as the ideal one.\r\nSince each nationality, and peoples of the same nationality, living in\r\ndifferent countries do not possess exactly the same type of face, the\r\ngeneral presumption of evolution as modifying notions of beauty must also\r\nbe taken into consideration. In the determination of the extent to which\r\nthe profile exists the facial angle plays a part. This angle was early\r\npointed out by Camper as a means of distinguishing the relative\r\ndevelopment of the skull and face. \"The basis on which a distinction of\r\nnationality is founded,\" said Camper, \"may be displayed by two straight\r\nlines (Fig. 19), one of which is to be drawn through the meatus auditorius\r\nto the base of the nose, and the other touching the prominent centre of\r\nthe forehead and falling thence on the most advancing portion of the upper\r\njaw, the head being used in profile. In the angle produced in these two\r\nlines may be said to consist not only the distinctions between the skulls\r\nof different species of animals, but also those which are found to exist\r\nbetween different races. The angle which the facial line or characteristic\r\nline of the visage makes varies from 70 deg. to 80 deg. in the race. All who raise\r\nit higher disobey the rules of art (from imitation of the antique). All\r\nwho bring it lower fall into the likeness of the monkeys. If I cause the\r\nfacial line to fall in front I have the antique head. If I incline it\r\nbackward I have the head of a negro. If I incline it still further I have\r\nthe head of a monkey; inclined still more I have the head of a dog; and,\r\nlastly, that of a goose.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. COLOURED CRIMINAL YOUTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is excellently shown by the following illustrations. Fig. 20 is the\r\nhead of Johanna, the female chimpanzee of Central Park, New York City.\r\nThis head has (by Camper's method) an angle between 40 deg. and 50 deg. The brain\r\nof this animal occupies one-third of the skull, and the jaws two-thirds.\r\nThe negro criminal (Fig. 21) has an angle of about 70 deg. Here the brain is\r\nencroaching, while the jaws are receding. The Caucasic race (Fig. 22) has\r\nan angle of 75 deg. to 80 deg. In many cases the frontal development of the\r\nbrain and resultant recession of the jaws produce an angle of 90 deg., with a\r\ngeneral result not unlike the Apollo.\r\n\r\nAlthough the general outlines of facial evolution as sighted by Camper are\r\nin accord with my own views, yet, as regards accuracy, this angle is not\r\nan ideal from whence to study face degeneracy, since the line does not\r\nfall low enough to include the chin, and also, as I have elsewhere shown,\r\nin the degenerate, the ear varies as much as one to one and one-half\r\ninches upon heads of different individuals. Frequently, in the degenerate\r\nclasses, the ears of the same individual differ as much as one inch in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAn ideal line, from whence to study a degenerate face, should be drawn\r\nperpendicularly from the supra-orbital ridge intersecting the upper and\r\nlower jaw and chin. While the chin of the Apollo Belvedere falls slightly\r\ninside of this line, yet this is hardly perceptible. Having now fixed a\r\nstandard from which to study the degenerate face, it should be remembered\r\nthat jaws which protrude beyond this line are atavistic, and those which\r\nrecede are even more degenerate.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe angle between 80 deg. and 90 deg. may be accepted as an ideal by which to\r\nstudy degeneracy. This factor alone, however, can not be accepted: the\r\nevolution of the face itself must be also taken into consideration. It is\r\nobvious that in the struggle for existence and supremacy between the brain\r\nand the face (both expressions of vertebrate advance), stress may be\r\nconcentrated on one particular part. Whence result certain factors which\r\nmodify the conclusion to be drawn from the facial angle. The hollowed out\r\ncondition of the face from the supra-orbital ridges down to and including\r\nthe base of the nose (illustrated in Johanna) merits attention here. The\r\nsame condition is observable in the negro, only it extends farther down\r\nand includes both jaws. One jaw, however, may alone be affected. Most of\r\nthe Chinese, Japanese, Eskimo, Polynesians, Australians, Aryan Caucasic\r\nAfricans, and some American Indians, possess this feature. As has been\r\nalready remarked, the facial regions of man and the ape up to a certain\r\npoint are similar. Not until the sense organs of man begin to develop are\r\nchanges noticeable in facial expression. If, through heredity or\r\nconstitutional defect, that part of the brain which presides over\r\ndevelopment of the facial bones lose its control, arrest of development of\r\nthat particular tissue results at any period between birth and the\r\ntwenty-fifth year, while other parts of the head and face continue to\r\ndevelop. With this understanding Camper's method can be safely applied to\r\ncertain cases. If a line be dropped from the supra-orbital ridge to the\r\nupper lip in its most prominent part (Fig. 23), it will be found here that\r\nin place of the face presenting the full appearance illustrated in Fig. 19\r\nand Fig. 22, it has the hollow appearance observable in Johanna and in\r\nFig. 25. This is due to arrest of development of the bones of the face and\r\nthe upper jaw. The extent of depression depends upon the time of arrest,\r\nthe frontal development of the skull, and the position of the upper jaw.\r\nThe nose may present and retain the appearance of that of a child six\r\nmonths old, or any other shape up to normal development, but will not\r\nprotrude from the face nor present a normal symmetrical appearance. It has\r\nthe appearance of having been driven into the face. It has been claimed\r\nthat the bridge of the nose is pushed out by the advancing brain and\r\ncranium. This may be true to a certain extent, but one is not necessarily\r\ndependent on the other, since an arrested nose is frequently found in a\r\nfully developed cranium (Fig. 24), which is not unlike Fig. 23 and a\r\n\"throw-back\" to Fig. 20. This is due to the fact that in the struggle for\r\nexistence the bones of the face and skull base became arrested early in\r\nlife, while the brain and cranium continued to advance. The lower jaw is\r\nusually normal since, while the tendency to arrest may be present in a\r\nslight degree, mobility of the jaw often causes such increased nutrition\r\nof the part that normal development in many cases thereby results.\r\nOverlooking this fact has often led to the assertion that a large lower\r\njaw exists when, in reality, this appearance is due to an arrest of the\r\nface and upper jaw, the lower remaining normal. The expression of\r\ndegeneracy is rather in the arrest of the upper jaw than in the normal\r\nlower (see Fig. 23).\r\n\r\nThe criminals of the Elmira Reformatory, and those of the Pontiac\r\nReformatory, present marked instances of this stigma, nearly 50 per cent.\r\nbeing so affected. Arrest of the lower jaw may occur alone, or may be\r\nassociated with arrest of development of the face (Fig. 25). When this is\r\nthe case a deep, broad groove extends from below the eyes downward and\r\nbackward to the lower jaw, also showing a lateral arrest of development,\r\nproducing a hatchet-shaped face. The upper part of the face may be normal,\r\nand the lower jaw arrested antero-posteriorly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been broadly asserted that this is an atavism, but more probably it\r\nis an expression of that phase of evolution whereby both jaws are becoming\r\nsubservient to the advance in evolution represented by the gains of the\r\nbrain and cranium. When both jaws are arrested Camper's disobedience of\r\nthe rules of art, whereby the facial angle is increased over 90 deg., occurs.\r\nThis condition has been found in many degenerates. Almost invariably in\r\nconnection with the arrest of development of the face occurs arrest of the\r\nbones of the nose. The diameter of the nasal cavities is much smaller\r\nthan normal. Owing to the unstable condition of the nervous system there\r\nis also hypertrophy of the turbinate bone and mucous membrane of the nose\r\nand throat, tonsil hypertrophy, arrested development of the chest walls\r\nand lung tissue, and unstable mucous membranes throughout the lungs. Such\r\na degenerate face, body, and unstable nervous system is a fruitful soil\r\nfor the germs of tuberculosis. In these cases even a casual glance will\r\nshow that the two halves of the face and head are not symmetrically\r\ndeveloped. It looks as though the two halves were made separately and\r\njoined together, one half higher than the other. This condition is\r\nexcellently illustrated in Fig. 26. In this case the left half is higher\r\nthan the right. (Frequently the right side is the higher.) There is arrest\r\nof the upper and lower jaw. The left corner of the mouth is higher than\r\nthe right. The left half of the lower jaw is higher than the right, the\r\nbody of the lower jaw is longer, the ramus is shorter. The left eye and\r\near are higher. The left supra-orbital ridge is higher. The ears stand\r\nalmost at right angles, while the malar processes are quite prominent.\r\nViewing the face from a three-quarters' angle (which should always be done\r\nin making an examination, or photographing the degenerate face for study)\r\nit will be found that there is not only arrest of development of the bones\r\nof the face, but also of the lower jaw.\r\n\r\nAs already stated in the chapter on the cranium, the nasal bones belong to\r\nthe dermal category, their special function as nose bones being a later\r\nacquisition. In their acquirement of this function they have passed\r\nthrough many changes, especially as the human face in its nasal features\r\nhas assumed an embryonic type. In consequence, like all late embryonic\r\nacquisitions, degeneracy is apt to involve the nose.\r\n\r\nWhen arrest of development of the face takes place stigmata of the nasal\r\nbones always result. Under such conditions narrowing or arrest of\r\ndevelopment of the entire nasal cavity ensues.\r\n\r\nDeformities of the nasal septum, deflection, hypertrophy and atrophy of\r\nthe turbinate bones, deformities of the maxillary sinus, hypertrophy of\r\nthe mucous membrane and polypi are common. Deflection of the external nose\r\nis a very common stigma of degeneracy. Not only is the septum involved,\r\nbut also the outer plates of the nasal cavity. So unstable are the bones\r\nof the face in their development that it is not an uncommon thing for the\r\nnasal process of the upper jaw on one side to be much more developed than\r\nthe other. Not only is the nasal septum involved, but also the bones of\r\nthe face as well, producing a fulness on the long side of the face. This\r\nstigma is very common among criminal youth. In such cases the deflected\r\nseptum is due to the development of the outer plate and not _vice versa_.\r\nDeflection of the septum to the left may entirely obliterate (as in Fig.\r\n27) the left nasal cavity. If one nostril of a rabbit be permanently\r\nclosed, after the animal has attained its full growth, the nasal cavity of\r\nthe affected side remains undeveloped and facial asymmetry results.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore two factors are common: first, the arrest of development of the\r\nbones of the nose, and second, the clogging of the cavity, both active\r\nagents in producing a closure, resulting in mouth-breathing.\r\n\r\nCoexisting with these is often (as in Fig. 27) smallness of the upper\r\njaw. In the same connection grooved teeth occur, as in the same\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe turbinated (Fig. 28) bones are often hypertrophied, as is also the\r\nnasal septum (vomer or dividing bone) and the mucous membrane. This\r\nresults from the general instability of the nervous system with its\r\nspecial expression in increased blood supply, whence occur overgrowth in\r\nand imperfect work by the mucous membrane, causing mouth-breathing and\r\npolypi, which again increase this defect. All these predispose to germ\r\ninvasion.\r\n\r\nIn the figure are also shown grooves upon the teeth. Sufficient symptoms\r\nare here evident to stamp this as a marked degenerate skull.\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the turbinate bones, septum, and mucous membrane, as it\r\noccurs among degenerates, appears in Fig. 29, and is due, first, to an\r\nunstable nervous system, and, second, a larger system of blood vessels\r\nwhich ramify through these parts. Stimulation, together with the stenosis\r\n(narrowing), tend to produce a closure. Still further, irritation and an\r\nunstable mucous membrane results, with polypi or adenoid vegetation\r\nfollowing.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot only do deflection of septum and hypertrophy of the nasal bones occur,\r\nbut the antrum (cavity behind the nose) may be almost entirely\r\nobliterated, while the upper jaw is arrested (Fig. 29). The antrum may be\r\nentirely wanting, as in Fig. 30; so unstable may these tissues develop\r\nthat the nasal cavities may become almost entirely obliterated, as\r\nobserved in this figure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese conditions are due to the unstable structure and large nerve and\r\nblood supply. Perhaps one of the most interesting points in connection\r\nwith degeneracy of the nose is the fact that in most cases the structures\r\nare either arrested or excessively developed, to the extent of the entire\r\nabsence of the inferior turbinate bone. This was the case in a girl\r\nthirteen years of age who died of tuberculosis. Her skull revealed many\r\nother forms of degeneracy as well. The deviation in the development of the\r\ntwo nasal cavities results from the excessive and arrested development of\r\nthe turbinates, thus preventing inhalation and exhalation of air, the free\r\nside developing and the closed side remaining undeveloped. In such case\r\nthe nose is deflected to the right or left, depending on which side is\r\narrested. When both nostrils are closed the nose becomes thin and pointed\r\nand mouth-breathing results. In degenerate nasal cavities polypi (tumours)\r\nare apt to occur.\r\n\r\nPersons with long, thin noses, arrested nasal cavities, sunken faces (as a\r\nresult mouth-breathers), and with contracted chest walls are the subjects\r\nfor tuberculosis. In such cases, especially when the nervous system is\r\nunstable, the different forms of catarrh are present. This condition\r\nworries the youth under the strain of puberty. To the catarrh which is\r\nmerely a result is ascribed his constitutional defects. These somatic\r\nsigns are quite noticeable in most of these cases, and by early\r\nrecognition proper treatment, with change of climate, frequently prolongs\r\nlife for years.\r\n\r\nThe so-called erectile tissue of the nose (containing blood whose flow is\r\nchecked through spasm to increase sensation), that relic of a time when\r\nsmell played a greater part among the senses, is apt to be affected by\r\ndegeneracy either as to its excessive or imperfect development. From this\r\ncomes the bleeding of the nose, so frequently an expression of nerve\r\nstrain at puberty, which may take the place of menstruation. It is to be\r\nnoted that while true haemophilia (\"bleeder\" tendency) occurs chiefly in\r\nboys, epistaxis shows itself very frequently in their sisters. A\r\nremarkable illustration of this was reported by Dr. Delia E. Howe,[199] of\r\nthe Fort Wayne (Indiana) School for the Feeble-minded. In cases of\r\nso-called male menstruation[200] the symptom is apt to be epistaxis.\r\n\r\nThe irregularity in blood supply predisposes the nose to attacks on its\r\nstructure from pathogenic germs. Hay fever is an expression of nervous\r\ninstability of these structures, and is especially apt to occur in\r\nneurasthenics, hysterics, and degenerates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDEGENERACY OF THE LIP, PALATE, EYE, AND EAR\r\n\r\n\r\nEach part or sense organ may, independently of the face as a whole,\r\nexhibit signs of degeneracy. The palate, lip, nose, eye, and ear have\r\ntheir own expressions of degeneracy. The palate, so far as the joining of\r\nits two parts is concerned, resists degeneracy to a remarkable degree. The\r\ncleft, which results from non-union, is usually an expression of general\r\ndegeneracy acted on by its nutritive expression, albeit cleft-palate may\r\nbe associated with the graver degeneracies like idiocy.\r\n\r\nAs the subjects of the deeper degeneracies associated with cleft-palate\r\nusually perish in early infancy, the nutritive degeneracies are most\r\nfrequently found associated with cleft-palate in adult life. The mouth in\r\nthe vertebrates does not agree in character with the invertebrate mouth.\r\nThe mouth has grown in proportion to evolution in the lower vertebrates.\r\nIt is larger, however, in proportion in the human embryo than in the\r\nadult. In this it agrees with the general lower type of the human face.\r\nThe human chin is at first retreating, and does not become distinctly\r\nprominent until the fifth month of foetal life. The nose separates from\r\nthe mouth toward the end of the second month. It is at first short and\r\nbroad and resembles at three months the type of some of the lower negro\r\nraces. When the nose is separated from the mouth a partition forms between\r\nthe cavities of the nose and the mouth, later supplemented by the true\r\npalate, which divides the mouth into an upper respiratory passage and a\r\nlower digestive passage. This palate is partly composed of bone and partly\r\nof flesh. The fleshy part ends in what is called the uvula. This is very\r\nsubject to abnormalities, as has been pointed out by C. L. Dana; it is a\r\nvery frequent mark of degeneracy. Dickens noticed the uvular tone of voice\r\nin young thieves, due to deformity of the uvula.\r\n\r\nCleft palates are comparatively rare in proportion to other forms of\r\nnutritive degeneracy. Palatal embryology casts light on the causation. At\r\na very early period of foetal life a series of clefts appear on each side\r\nof the cephalic extremity, separated by rods of tissue called branchial\r\narches. The clefts communicate with the alimentary canal. These various\r\nclefts have usually coalesced about the ninth and tenth week of foetal\r\nlife, but occasionally this coalescence fails or is incomplete. This leads\r\nto various deformities, the chief of which are cleft palate and hare-lip.\r\nCleft palate has been known to affect several members of the same family,\r\nand to occur in the offspring of the affected members. There are instances\r\nof the transmission of this deformity from an affected pug-bitch to her\r\noffspring. If it were possible to practise selective breeding in man as in\r\ndogs a race of men with hare-lips and cleft palates could probably be\r\nproduced.[201]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCleft palate may be divided into two classes, congenital and acquired,\r\nacquired cleft palate being the result of disease either inherited or\r\nacquired, but only affecting the part after birth. Congenital cleft palate\r\nis divisible into two kinds, complete and partial; complete when the\r\nfissure extends the entire length, from the uvula to and including the\r\nanterior alveolar process and even the lips (Fig. 31), partial when only a\r\nsmall part of the structure is involved. Thus the cleft may extend through\r\nthe anterior alveolar process, involving the incisive bone only, which is\r\nvery rare; when present single or double hare-lip almost invariably\r\ncoexists. I have observed in practice six cases where a small portion of\r\nthe interior alveolar process was involved, with the jaw and one or two\r\nteeth. The hard palate only may be involved to the extent of a small\r\nfissure, or the whole palate may be wanting. The soft palate only may\r\ncontain the cleft, or simply the uvula. Cases are on record in which the\r\nnon-development of the intermaxillary bones produces fissures in the lip.\r\n_A priori_, cleft palate is an evident expression of hereditary defect.\r\nLangdon Down found a constant relation between brain deformity, cleft\r\npalate, and deformed vaults.\r\n\r\nIn a case cited elsewhere,[202] three members of one family had cleft\r\npalate; one 17 years old, the other 30, and the third 35. The first and\r\nlast are women, the other a married man with a family, who have no trace\r\nof the father's deformity. In these cases no instance of cleft palate\r\ncould be found either among the ancestors or the collateral branches of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nAnother family has a remarkable history. G. H. C., born 1853, perfect; L.\r\nC., born 1855, single hare-lip and cleft palate; J. F. C., born 1856,\r\nperfect; F. W. C., born 1860, double hare-lip and cleft palate; H. E. C.,\r\nborn 1868, perfect. The paternal grandmother also had cleft palate.\r\n\r\nKnecht found that 5 per cent. of 1,200 criminals examined had cleft\r\npalate. Fourteen per cent. of the prostitutes examined by Pauline\r\nTarnowsky had cleft palates. Langdon Down, among congenital idiots, found\r\nonly a half per cent. of cleft palates. Grenzer found only nine cases in\r\n14,466 children, or one in 1,607. I examined 1,977 feeble-minded children\r\nwithout finding a single case. In 207 blind only one case was observed. In\r\n1,235 deaf mutes two cases were found. The percentage among the defective\r\nclasses, while not large, is, undoubtedly, much larger than among normal\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nA keeper of the Zoological Gardens in Philadelphia observed cleft palate\r\nin the mouths of lion cubs born in the gardens. Cleft palates were also\r\nobserved in a number of pups born in Buffalo. Dr. Ogle found that 99 per\r\ncent. of the lion cubs born in the London Zoological Gardens had cleft\r\npalates. He claims that this is due to the artificial diet, as the result\r\nof enforced captivity. Similar results observed in other gardens in Europe\r\nare charged to feeding the mothers with meat without bone, as feeding with\r\nthe whole carcass of small animals greatly diminished these deformities.\r\nIt would seem that if cleft palate is due to this cause other bony\r\nstructures should also be involved, and, as a matter of fact, many of the\r\nlions born in captivity are rickety. Cleft palate has been observed among\r\ndogs, sheep, goats, &c. The question, therefore, whether domesticity here\r\ndoes not play the alleged part of civilisation in man can be solved only\r\nby a knowledge of the frequency of the condition among wild animals of the\r\nsame genus. It is evident that, in dealing with the question of aetiology,\r\nthe influence of shock on the mother's nervous system cannot be excluded\r\nin the cases charged to feeding.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that cleft palate is a factor which predisposes to\r\ndeath by infectious diseases whose local manifestations are in the mouth\r\nand throat; hence the majority of the degenerates in whom cleft palate\r\noccurs are liable to die before the completion of their fifth year.\r\nHare-lip (Fig. 32) is an exceedingly hereditary disorder, as Murray,\r\nDemarquay, Trelat, Hutchinson, Fere, Marsh, Lucas, Ireland, and others\r\nhave shown. It occurs with great frequency in almost all forms of\r\ndegeneracy. Kiernan, of Chicago, has found that 5 per cent. of the\r\nhereditary lunatics in that city and in New York City have hare-lip.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far degeneracy may turn back the page of evolution is excellently\r\nillustrated in the cyclopian descendants of degenerate families elsewhere\r\ncited from Kiernan, of Chicago. While there is a seeming conflict as to\r\nthe primitive eye type of vertebrates between morphologists represented by\r\nHoward Ayres[203] (who claims that the eyes were derived from the median\r\neye of the ascidian lancelet) and Semper[204] (who is of the opinion that\r\nthe existing vertebrate eyes represent the paired eyes of a hypothetical\r\nannelid precursor); still both opinions are fully reconcilable through the\r\nresults of study of the ascidian and lancelet eye collated with cyclopian\r\nand triophthalmic (three-eyed) degeneracies in man, the human eye and the\r\nthird eye of reptiles like the hatteria of New Zealand. The eye of the\r\nascidian tadpole agrees fundamentally with the type of eye peculiar to the\r\nvertebrates in that the retina is derived from the wall of the brain. On\r\nthis account it is called a myolonic eye. In the typical invertebrate eye,\r\non the contrary, the retinal cells are differentiated from the external\r\nectoderm.\r\n\r\nThe ascidian eye, however, differs, as Osborn[205] remarks, essentially\r\nfrom the paired eyes of the craniate (skulled) vertebrates in that the\r\nlens as well as the retina is derived from the wall of the brain. The lens\r\nof the lateral eye of the vertebrates is derived by an invagination of the\r\nectoderm, which meets and fits in the retinal cup at the end of the optic\r\nvesicle. The ascidian eye, however, agrees in respect to the origin of its\r\nlens with the parietal or pineal eye of the lizard, in which the lens is\r\nlikewise derived from cells which form part of the wall of the cerebral\r\noutgrowth which gives rise to the pineal body.\r\n\r\nThe pineal body is another of those remarkable rudimentary structures\r\nwhose constant presence in all groups of vertebrates forms such an\r\neminently characteristic median outgrowth from the dorsal wall of the\r\nbrain (thalamencephalon), the distal extremity of which dilates into a\r\nvesicle and becomes separated from the proximal portion. The distal\r\nvesicle becomes entirely constricted off from the primary epiphysial\r\n(pineal) outgrowth of the brain, and the parietal nerve does not represent\r\nthe primitive connection of the pineal eye with the roof of the brain, but\r\narises quite independently of the proximal portion of the epiphysis.\r\n\r\nThe remote ancestors of the vertebrates possessed a median, unpaired,\r\nmyolonic eye, which was subsequently replaced in function by the evolution\r\nof the paired eyes. The cyclopic condition occurs very frequently among\r\nhuman monstrosities, much more frequently than among animals, Hannover\r\nclaims,[206] but this is clearly due to the fact that human monstrosities\r\nare much more frequently recorded. Of the 120 cases I have been able to\r\ncollect from literature, 56 presented other evidences of degeneracy than\r\ncyclopic conditions, and 60 had neuropathic or other taint in the\r\nancestry. Dareste[207] has shown that the production of a single eye, the\r\nchanges in the structure of the mouth, the atrophy and abnormal situation\r\nof the olfactory apparatus and of the vesicle of the hemispheres, all\r\nresult from an arrest of development. The determining influence must be\r\nexerted very early in the life history of the embryo.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHannover points out that there often is coincident hydrocephalus and\r\nharelip, imperfect genital development, and allied arrest of development.\r\nJ. R. Folsom, of Cecil, Georgia, has reported a female, born alive to a\r\nnegro multipara, who died two hours after birth. The eye was centrally\r\nlocated in the forehead, on a line with the nose. The brow was a complete\r\narch, as was the upper eyelid. The lower lid had a mark midway, indicating\r\nan attempt at division. The nasal bones were wanting, but the soft part of\r\nthe nose, destitute of the orifice, hung over the mouth, which was\r\ncompletely covered. The chin was recedent. C. Phisalix described a case in\r\nwhich the nose was wanting. Its place in the median was occupied by a\r\nsingle eye; on the horizontal diameter were two pupils separated by a\r\nnarrow space. Landolt, discussing a case reported by Valude, points out\r\nthat in cyclopic eyes all the parts may be double or united in every\r\ndegree except that there is never a single lens or double vitreous. Bock\r\nand others, however, describe cases in which the eye has not been formed\r\nby the conglomeration of two separately developed eyes, but it is a single\r\ndeveloped eye; the other being wanting entirely. Bruce reports a cyclop\r\nin which there was a single socket for the eye of a lozenge-shape,\r\nsituated in the lower middle of the forehead. The socket was furnished\r\nwith two pairs of eyelids, upper and lower. The eye was found to consist\r\nof two rudimentary eyes, with two rudimentary retinae, apparently springing\r\nfrom a single optic vesicle. The nose was represented by a short process\r\nattached to the forehead, above the median eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cyclops illustrated (Figs. 33, 34) was born to a 17-year old\r\nneuropathic primipara, after a protracted labour. The child was living,\r\nbut was killed by pressure on the funis. The mouth contained an ivory,\r\ntusk-like tooth at each corner. There was mane-like hair around the neck.\r\n\r\nCyclopia is very frequently associated with the absence of both the\r\ninternal and external ear, and with synotia (joined ears).\r\n\r\nIn triophthalmic cases the three eyes are usually separate, two occupying\r\nthe usual position, while the third is situated as illustrated in the case\r\ncited. Ninety families of degenerates, averaging eleven children each, had\r\nfive cases of cyclops.\r\n\r\nDegeneracy, which affects so deeply the development of the eye, naturally\r\ntends to evince itself in other anomalous states in the organ. As\r\nexcessive asymmetry of the body is one of the most noticeable of the\r\nstigmata of degeneracy, it is not astonishing to find that this asymmetry\r\nexpresses itself both in the position as well as in the size and structure\r\nof the eye. As Kiernan[208] pointed out, twenty years ago, asymmetrical\r\nirides are exceedingly frequent in the types of insanity due to hereditary\r\ndefect. This observation has since been confirmed by Fere,[209] not only\r\nas to the insane, but as to other classes of the degenerate. The\r\nconditions of the eye known as microphthalmia (small eye), macrophthalmia\r\n(big eyes) and anophthalmia (absence of eyes), are found quite frequent in\r\ndegenerate families. Very frequently the pupil of the eye is asymmetrical.\r\nThis was pointed out by Kiernan in the case of Guiteau. Corectopia\r\n(displacement of the pupil so that it is not in the centre of the iris)\r\noften exists. Coloboma (eye fissure) is also not infrequent among the\r\ndegenerate. These vary greatly in situation and general results. The iris\r\nis sometimes completely absent on one or both sides. Beside the anomalies,\r\ndiseased conditions like retinitis pigmentosa, congenital cataract and the\r\nmacular degeneracy cited by C. P. Pinckard,[210] of Chicago, are far from\r\ninfrequent expressions of degenerate taint in the eye; the organ in this\r\nparticular obeying the general law that degeneracy may show itself in the\r\nminute change resulting in disturbance of function or in that producing\r\ndisease, or, finally, in atavism. The defects of the eyes requiring\r\nglasses are exceedingly frequent in degenerates, and often aggravate their\r\nmorbidity. Here, as in the case of the teeth, the chief factor is often\r\nignored.\r\n\r\nThe external ear is, of all organs, that most affected by degeneracy.[211]\r\nIt is a cartilaginous organ extending from a bony base, without a bony\r\nframework for its support and with very deficient blood supply, on account\r\nof its distances from the great blood centres, so that any defect in the\r\nnerve centres which control the local blood supply is likely to affect its\r\nnutrition. As a cartilaginous organ it has no lymphatics, which of\r\nnecessity affects its growth. The sensitiveness of the ear to vasomotor\r\nchanges is evident by the results of the extremes in heat and cold,\r\nemotional blushing and fatigue. Galton reports a schoolmistress who judges\r\nthe fatigue of her pupils by the condition of their ears. If the ears be\r\nwhite, flabby and pendant, she concludes that the children are much\r\nfatigued. If they be relaxed, but red, they are suffering, not from\r\noverwork, but from a struggle with the nervous system rarely under control\r\nin children. These states are very common among degenerates.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate the degeneracy observed in the ear its embryology requires\r\nstudy. Before the end of the first month[212] there appears around the\r\nexternal opening of the first gill-cleft (Fig. 35) a series of six\r\ntubercles, two in front on the hind edge of the first visceral arch, one\r\nabove the cleft and three behind it (Fig. 36). A little later a vertical\r\nfurrow appears down the middle of the hyoid arch, in such a way as to mark\r\noff a little ridge which joins on to tubercle 3 and descends behind\r\ntubercles 4 and 5. The second stage is reached by the growth of all the\r\nparts; the fusion of tubercles 2 and 3 and the growth of the ridge down\r\nbehind tubercle 5 to become continuous with 6. After these changes it is\r\nnot difficult to identify the parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTubercle No. 1 is the tragus; 2 and 3, together with the arching ridge,\r\nrepresent the helix; 4, the anti-helix; 5, the anti-tragus; and 6, the\r\nlobule; the pit between the tubercles the fossa angularis. During the\r\nlatter part of the second month the ear changes in its proportion somewhat\r\nin the irregular development. The third stage begins at the third month.\r\nThe upper and posterior part of the concha arises from the surface of the\r\nhead, and gradually but rapidly bends forward so as to completely cover\r\nthe anti-helix and the upper portion of the fossa angularis. During this\r\nstage in mammals the assumption of the pointed form of the ear commences.\r\nThe fourth stage begins at the fourth month, when the tubercles, which are\r\nnow joined together by cartilages, commence to unfold and are completed by\r\nthe fifth month. Finally, the sixth tubercle develops to form the lobule.\r\nThis unfolding or development of the tubercles to produce the different\r\nportions of the ear and make it complete is not unlike the development of\r\na flower from the bud. By this process may be understood how if, by\r\nmalnutrition in one tubercle or bud, or should there be a larger supply of\r\nnutriment in one than another, malformation of the ear would result. If\r\narrest of development of all the tubercles should take place at any\r\nperiod, from the first to the fifth month of foetal life, the ear would\r\nresemble a semi-developed flower! (Fig. 37).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs in other cases, it is necessary to fix an approximately normal standard\r\nfor the ear from the standpoint of man's status in evolution. The ear\r\ngrows more or less through life, but, like the skeleton, practically\r\nreaches its full development about the twenty-sixth year. That this is not\r\nalways the case, however, is demonstrated by the results of the\r\nexamination of 546 persons. In an examination of 63 children between 6 and\r\n18 months old the ears measured from 1.60 to 2.12, the average being 1.90\r\ninches; in width from .75 to 1, with an average of .96. In 127 children\r\nfrom 8 to 12 years old the ear measured from 1.95 to 2.32 inches, the\r\naverage being 2.19; width .81 to 1.50, the average being 1.06. In 356\r\npersons between 12 and 50 years old the shortest ear was 2, the longest 3,\r\nthe average 2.50; width, smallest 1, largest 1.50, the average being 1.22\r\ninches. The normal ear, or rather the ideal one (for few persons possess\r\nit in its entirety), should have a gracefully curved outline, be nowhere\r\npointed or irregular, have a well-defined helix, separated from the\r\nanti-helix by a distinct scaphoid fossa extending down nearly to the level\r\nof the anti-tragus (Fig. 38). Its root should be lost in the concha before\r\nreaching the anti-helix. The anti-helix should not be unduly prominent,\r\nand should have a well-marked bifurcation at its superior extremity. The\r\nlobule should be shapely, not adherent, not too pendulous and free from\r\ngrooves extending from the scaphoid fossa. The whole should be well\r\nshaped, and its proper proportion and size may be inferred from the table\r\njust given; in the adult it should not average over two and a half inches\r\nin length and one and a quarter in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe aural deformities that fall under the head of stigmata, or have been\r\nclassed as such, affect all portions of the external ear. The helix may be\r\nimperfect, it may be angular, from Darwin's tubercle it may lack its\r\ninward roll, it may be interrupted, the root of the helix may extend\r\ninward completely across the concha, and in very rare instances it may be\r\nbifurcated. The anti-helix may be unduly prominent or be insignificant;\r\nthe scaphoid fossa may extend through the lobule or be triple.[213] The\r\nlobule may be adherent and sometimes almost absent, thus producing the\r\njug-handle-shaped, or so-called Morel ear. It may be exaggerated in size;\r\nthe whole ear may be misshapen, too large or too small. These deformities\r\nmay exist in nearly every degree, only when pronounced can they be\r\nconsidered as stigmata. Others have been noted, but their importance as\r\nsigns of degeneracy is not very significant unless they co-exist with\r\nseveral of those above mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ears of degenerates frequently grow in later life to an enormous size.\r\nOn examination of 207 paupers over 50 years old the shortest ear was found\r\nto be 2.25 inches, the longest 3.36; the average on the right side was\r\n2.73, on the left 2.76; the narrowest ear was .88, the widest 1.50, the\r\naverage 1.26. These results, compared with the results of the measurements\r\nof normal persons from 12 to 50 years, plainly demonstrate that the ears\r\nof degenerates grow after the twenty-sixth year, when the skeleton has\r\ncompleted its development. With such large ears other stigmata are\r\ngenerally associated. A few of the best types of stigmata of the ear\r\nillustrate better than any description the general characteristics. Fig.\r\n39 illustrates the ear _par excellence_ of degeneracy, the typical\r\njug-handled ear first described by Morel and called by his name. This\r\nconsists of a long, narrow ear attached its entire length, and tapering\r\nupward and outward from the lobe to the point where the Darwinian tubercle\r\nis located, and there it may take any shape--round, straight, or\r\npointed--as illustrated in the drawing. The most singular deformity of the\r\nhelix is the tubercle of Darwin, which is a little blunt point,\r\nprojecting from the inwardly folded margin or helix. When present it is\r\ndeveloped at birth and, according to Ludwig Meyer, more frequent in men\r\nthan in women. Fig. 40 shows ear and tubercle taken from Darwin.[214]\r\nThese points not only project in toward the centre of the ear, but open a\r\nlittle outwards (Fig. 41) from its plane, so as to be visible when the\r\nhead is viewed from directly in front and behind. They are variable in\r\nsize, number and somewhat in position (Fig. 42), standing either a little\r\nhigher or lower, and they sometimes occur on one ear and not on the other.\r\nAnother marked form of ear degeneracy is one in which the ear is developed\r\nbackward at an angle of about 45 deg. (Fig. 43). The general outline of the\r\near is fairly good. The anti-helix is much larger than it should be.\r\nDegeneracy usually extends deeply into the organisation of those in whom\r\nthis ear is present.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43. EAR ALMOST HORIZONTAL AND AT RIGHT ANGLES WITH THE\r\nHEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44. EAR ALMOST ROUND WITH THREE DARWINIAN TUBERCLES AT\r\nINNER BORDER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 44 illustrates noticeable stigmata. The ear stands at right angles\r\nwith the head. It is, however, almost as broad as it is long and differs\r\nin shape. The outer helix is excessively developed. The scaphoid fossa\r\nextends through the lobe, which is continuous with the body of the ear and\r\nis not distinct. The root of the helix is excessively developed. There are\r\nthree Darwinian tubercles on its border. The anti-tragus is undeveloped.\r\nThe tragus is very small and divided into two parts. The auricle-temporal\r\nangle, for functional purposes, should not exceed, according to Buchanan,\r\n30 deg., or be less than 15 deg. The difference in this respect is not clear,\r\nsince free movement of head and body will readily adjust the auricle to\r\nreceive sound. For functional purposes it would seem that the construction\r\nand shape of the ear, especially the anti-helix and concha, would be of\r\ngreater importance than its position to the head, since it is necessary to\r\ncollect the waves of sound for transmission. From a degeneracy\r\nstandpoint, however, the position of the ear is important. Frigerio,[215]\r\nfrom the examination of several hundred subjects, concludes that the\r\nauricle-temporal angle undergoes a gradual progress from below 90 deg. in\r\ncriminals and the insane to above 90 deg. in apes. He found the large angle\r\nvery marked in homicides, less so in thieves. There is no question but\r\nthat Frigerio is correct in regard to this point. In an examination of the\r\nears of 465 boy criminals at Pontiac, it was found that 198 were close to\r\nthe head, or from 10 to 15 deg.; 152 at an angle of 45 deg., and 115 at right\r\nangles or 90 deg. Of 1,041 criminals at Elmira 285 were close, 567 at an\r\nangle of 45 deg., and 187 at right angles.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 45 shows the ear which Hawthorne gives Donatello in the _Marble\r\nFaun_; it has been called the \"Satanic\" ear, because of the pointed\r\nextremities and its narrowness. The helix is rolled upon itself its entire\r\nlength, giving the impression of great thickness. The anti-helix is\r\nexcessively developed. Figs. 46, 47, 48 (ears of three illegitimate\r\nchildren at birth) show different stages of development as well as marked\r\nstigmata. Arrest of development occurs between the fourth and fifth month,\r\nowing to the trophic nerve centres being affected by the malnutrition of\r\nthe mother. Fig. 49 exhibits the development of a congenital, elephantine\r\near in monstrosities. The resemblance to the large ear of the orang and\r\nchimpanzee is very marked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEGENERATE TEETH AND JAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nNext to the ears, the jaws and teeth (as was to be expected from the\r\nvariability of these organs in allied animals) are most affected by\r\ndegeneracy. This is particularly true of the vertebrates, especially\r\nmammals, as might have been anticipated from their phylogeny. At the head\r\nof the vertebrates is man; at the foot is the lancelet (amphioxus), which\r\nis perhaps most akin to those semi-vertebrates the ascidians, who, in\r\ntheir larval phase, are higher than when adult, and whose life-history\r\nexcellently illustrates that potent phase of evolution, degeneracy.\r\n\r\nThe lancelet has a spinal cord enclosed in a half-gristly canal (the\r\nnotochord). It is practically destitute of a brain. The cerebral vesicle\r\nwhich represents this is a plain cavity without true subdivision into\r\nventricles. There is no cranium. The eye (central in position) is a mere\r\npigment spot with which it is able to distinguish light from darkness. The\r\nnose (behind this) is a small pit, lined with cilia, for purposes of\r\nsmell. Into this the cerebral vesicle of the larval lancelet opens. The\r\nmouth is well guarded against the intrusion of noxious substances which\r\nhave to pass through a vestibule richly provided with sensitive cells,\r\nresembling the taste buds of the human mouth. There is no heart. In this,\r\nas in the case of the eye, the lancelet is lower than the ascidians, the\r\ninsects, crustaceans, and many molluscs. It approximates those worms\r\nwhich, despite a very elaborate vascular system, are destitute of a heart,\r\nthe function of which is performed by contractile blood-vessels. From an\r\nembryologic and morphologic standpoint the proximate ancestor of the\r\nvertebrates may have been a free swimming animal, intermediate between an\r\nascidian tadpole and the lancelet, and the primordial ancestor, a\r\nworm-like animal organised on a level with the star-fish. The vertebrates\r\nembryologically develop from this stage to the lampreys; thence to the\r\ncartilaginous fish (shark); to the amphibia (frog, toad, axolotl); to the\r\nreptiles; and thence to the oviparous mammals (duck-bill and echidna or\r\nspiny ant-eater); to the lemurs, and through forms like the\r\n_Pithecanthropus erectus_ to man. Mammal teeth pass, in evolution, from\r\nthe simple types found in that oviparous edentate, the spiny ant-eater of\r\nAustralia, to those of the indeciduous ancestors of the sloths and\r\narmadilloes, and their descendants, inclusive of the dolphins and whales,\r\nwhose teeth, both in the fetal Greenland and adult sperm whale, preserve\r\nthis old type. (The whales have degenerated from the hoofed mammals to\r\nsuit their environment.) While, as in the edentates, these teeth may be\r\nfew, they may also, as in the insectivorous marsupials, approximate those\r\nof the reptilia in number (sixty or seventy on a side) and characteristic\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nThe evolution of this primitive tooth to the bicuspid and molar type has\r\nbeen explained by two theories: that of concrescence and that of\r\ndifferentiation.[216]\r\n\r\nA number of conical teeth, in line as they lie in the jaws of the sperm\r\nwhale, represent the primitive dentition.[217] In time a number of these\r\nteeth, according to the concresent theory, cluster together so as to form\r\nthe four cusps of a human molar, each one of the whale tooth points\r\nforming one of the cusps of the mammalian tooth. Vertically succeeding\r\nteeth might also be grouped. What evidence is there in favour of this\r\ntheory? and what is there against it? All primitive reptiles from which\r\nthe mammals have descended, and many of the existing mammals, have a large\r\nnumber of isolated teeth of a conical form. Further, by shortening of the\r\njaws, the embryonic germ from which each of the numerous tooth-caps is\r\nbudded off in course of development could have been brought together in\r\nsuch a manner that any cusps originally stretched out in a line would form\r\ngroups of a variable number of cusps, according to the more or less\r\ncomplex pattern of the crown. Against the acceptance of this theory stands\r\nthe fact that cusps quite similar in all respects to each of the cusps\r\nwhich form the angles of the human molar are even now being added to the\r\nteeth in certain animals, such as the elephant, whose molar teeth cusps\r\nare being thus complicated. In the mesozoic period certain animals with\r\ntricuspid teeth occur. According to the theory of concrescence these teeth\r\nought not to show any increase of cusps in later geologic periods, but\r\ndown through the ages to the present time successors of those animals\r\ncontinue to present a very much larger number of cusps. How is this\r\nincrease of cusps to be accounted for? Has there been a reserve store of\r\nconical teeth to increase the number? Most obviously to every student of\r\nthe fossil history of cusps there is no reserve store, but new cusps are\r\nconstantly rising upon the original crown itself by cusp addition.\r\n\r\nIn the Triassic occur the first mammalia with conical, round, reptilian\r\nteeth. There are also some aberrant types which possess complex or\r\nmultitubercular teeth.\r\n\r\nThese teeth begin to show the first trace of cusp addition.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 1, Plate A, the teeth of the dromatherium of the coal beds of\r\nNorth Carolina occur on the sides of the main cone, cusps or rudimentary\r\ncuspules. On either side of the main cone are two cuspules. In the same\r\ndeposit occurred another animal represented by a single tooth (Fig. 3), in\r\nwhich these cusps are slightly larger. These cusps have obviously been\r\nadded to the side of the teeth and are now growing. In teeth of the\r\nJurassic period, found in large numbers both in America and in England,\r\nbut still of very minute size, are observed the same three cusps. These\r\ncusps have now taken two different positions; in one case they have the\r\narrangement presented in Plate B. The middle cusp is relatively lower, and\r\nthe lateral cusps are relatively higher; in fact these cones are almost\r\nequal in size. These teeth are termed triconodont, as having three nearly\r\nequal cones. But associated with this is the spalacotherium, the teeth of\r\nwhich are represented in Plate A, Fig. 4. This tooth illustrates the\r\ntransformation of a tooth (triconodont) with three cusps in line into a\r\ntooth with three cusps forming a triangle. Here the primitive cusp is\r\nthe apex of a triangle of which the two lateral cusps are the base. This\r\ntooth, in this single genus, is the key of comparison of the teeth of all\r\nmammalia. By this can be determined that part of a human molar which\r\ncorresponds with a conical reptilian tooth. This stage is the triangle\r\nstage; the next stage is the development of a heel or spur upon this\r\ntriangle (see in the amphitherium, Fig. 5). The opossum still distinctly\r\npreserves the ancient triangle. Look at it in profile, inside or in top\r\nview, and see that the anterior part of the tooth is unmodified. This\r\ntriangle is traceable through a number of intermediate types. In Miacia\r\n(Fig. 6), a primitive carnivore, is a high triangle and a heel; looked at\r\nfrom above (Fig. 6a), the heel is seen to have spread out broader so that\r\nit is as broad as the triangle. The three molars of this animal illustrate\r\na most important principle, namely, that the anterior, triangular portion\r\nof the crown has been simply levelled down to the posterior portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE B.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese three teeth form a series of intermediate steps between a most\r\nancient molar and the modern molar of the human type. The second tooth is\r\nhalfway between the first and third. The second molar, seen from above,\r\nhas exactly the same cusps as the first, so it is not difficult to\r\nrecognise that each cusp has been directly derived from its fellow. The\r\nthird tooth of the series (Fig. 7) has lost one of its cusps; it has lost\r\na cusp of the triangle. It is now a tooth where only half the triangle is\r\nleft on the anterior side and with a very long heel. That tooth has\r\nexactly the same pattern as the lower human molar tooth (Fig. 8), the only\r\ndifference is that the heel is somewhat more prolonged. These teeth belong\r\nto one of the oldest fossil monkeys, anaptomorphus. Human lower molars,\r\nnot very exceptionally, instead of four cusps, have five. The fifth cusp\r\nalways appears in the middle of the heel, or between the posterior lingual\r\nand the posterior buccal. This occurs in monkeys and other animals, but no\r\nrecord exists of the ancient anterior lingual reappearing. The human lower\r\nmolar, with its low, quadritubercular crown, has hence evolved by addition\r\nof cusps and by gradual modelling from a high-crowned, simple, pointed\r\ntooth.\r\n\r\nHuman teeth are of excellent service in the initial determination of\r\ndegeneracy in the child. For this purpose the teeth should be studied from\r\nthe first evidence of their development until they are all in place, which\r\noccurs normally, in most cases, by the twenty-second year.\r\n\r\nTeeth-enamel is formed from the epiblast, and dentine, cementum, pulp\r\n(except as to nerve tissue) from the mesoblast. The enamel organs of the\r\nfirst set appear during the seventh week of foetal life; the dentine bulb\r\nduring the ninth week. At this period the tooth obtains its periphery.\r\nThis models the enamel cap which fits over the dentine like a glove. When\r\nimperfections in hand or fingers exist these deformities are distinctly\r\nobserved upon the glove, and in precisely the same manner are observed the\r\ndifferent shapes and sizes of the incisors, cuspids, and molars.\r\nCalcification of the teeth begins at the seventeenth week of foetal life.\r\nThe illustration (Fig. 50) shows the progress of calcification and\r\ndevelopment of the temporary set of teeth. Examination will show that any\r\ndefect in nutrition, from conception to birth (due to inherited states or\r\nmaternal impressions), has been registered upon the teeth. The state of\r\nthe constitution and the locality register the date of such defects. Thus\r\nif the tooth, as a whole, be larger or smaller than normal, or abnormally\r\nirregular, taint is undoubtedly inherited from one or both parents. If, on\r\nthe other hand, there be defect at any part on the crowns of the teeth,\r\nand the contour be perfect, the date of malnutrition can be easily\r\ndetermined from this chart. More or less than the normal number of teeth,\r\nabnormally placed, demonstrates the existence of inherited defect, since\r\nthe germs must have been deposited at the period mentioned. No absolute\r\nrule can be laid down as to date of the eruption of the teeth. The teeth\r\nof the temporary set erupt nearly as follows:\r\n\r\n                            _After Birth._         _Time of Eruption._\r\n  Lower Central Incisors     7 months                1 to 10 weeks.\r\n  Upper    \"       \"         9 months                4 to 6 weeks.\r\n  Upper and Lower Lateral   12 months                4 to 6 weeks.\r\n  First Molars              14 months                1 to 2 months.\r\n  Cuspids                   18 months                2 to 3 months.\r\n  Second Molars             26 months                3 to 5 months.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51. SHOWS LINES OF DEVELOPMENT OF THE PERMANENT\r\nTEETH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe enamel organs and dentine bulb for the permanent teeth form just\r\nbefore birth (Fig. 51) in like manner with the temporary set. They form\r\njust above the temporary set on the upper and below on the lower jaw. The\r\npermanent molars begin to calcify at the twenty-fifth week of foetal life.\r\nThe permanent incisors do not calcify until a year after birth. Any\r\ndeviation in size or contour of the permanent teeth from the normal must\r\nhence be due to defect in nutrition in the dentine bulb, between the\r\nfifteenth and twenty-fifth week of foetal life. Any deviation in\r\ncalcification (except the cusps of the first permanent molars) must occur\r\nafter birth. At the third year twenty-four teeth are fairly well\r\ncalcified. At the fifth year the second permanent molars, and at the\r\neighth year the third molars or wisdom teeth, begin to calcify.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the age of eruption of permanent teeth:\r\n\r\n  First Permanent Molars               Circa         6 years.\r\n  Upper and Lower Central Incisors       \"           7 years.\r\n  Upper and Lower Lateral    \"           \"           8 years.\r\n  First Bicuspids                        \"           9 years.\r\n  Second Bicuspids                       \"          10 years.\r\n  Cuspids                                \"          11 years.\r\n  Second Permanent Molars                \"          12 years.\r\n  Third Permanent Molars                 \"    17 to 24 years.\r\n\r\nMan, at this present stage of evolution, has twenty teeth in his temporary\r\nand thirty-two in his permanent set. Any deviation in number is the result\r\nof embryonic change occurring between the sixth and fifteenth week, for\r\nthe temporary teeth, and the fifteenth week and birth for the permanent.\r\nThe germs of teeth which erupt late in life, and are called third sets, of\r\nnecessity appear ere birth and are completely formed at the beginning of\r\nthe second year, although they remain protected in the jaw until\r\neruption.\r\n\r\nMore than twenty teeth in the temporary set, or thirty-two in the\r\npermanent set, is hence an atavistic abnormality. From the maxillary and\r\ndental standpoint man reached his highest development when well-developed\r\njaws held twenty temporary and thirty-two permanent teeth. Decrease in the\r\nnumbers of teeth meant, from the dental standpoint, degeneracy, albeit it\r\nmight mark advance in man's evolution as a complete being. In the New\r\nMexican Lower Eocene occur monkeys like the lemurarius and limnotherium,\r\neach the type of a distinct family. The lemurarius, most nearly allied to\r\nthe lemurs, is the most generalised monkey yet found. It had forty-four\r\nteeth in continuous series, above and below. The limnotherium, while\r\nrelated to the lemurs, had some affinities with the American marmosets.\r\nThese solved the problem of the origin of the extra teeth (known as\r\nsupernumeraries) that sometimes occur in man, and demonstrated that man,\r\nduring his evolution from the lowest monkey, lost twelve teeth. These\r\nsupernumerary teeth assume two forms; either they resemble the adjoining\r\nteeth or are cone-shaped. While they are rarely exactly counterparts,\r\nevery tooth can be duplicated, as the following illustrations show.\r\n\r\nFig. 52 illustrates fairly well-formed duplicate central incisors, the\r\nnormal incisors being outside the dental arch. They are crowded laterally\r\nby the large roots of the supernumerary incisors.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 53 shows an extra right lateral in a temporary set in the upper jaw.\r\nFig. 54 an extra right lateral in the permanent set. Fig. 55 illustrates\r\nnormally developed supernumerary cuspids which are all grouped together\r\nupon the right side, the bicuspid being also duplicated on each side;\r\nindeed, all but the molars are duplicate. Fig. 56 shows supernumerary\r\nthird molars, easily demarcated from the normal molars. The teeth which\r\nfail to approximate their normal neighbours assume the cone shape of the\r\nprimitive tooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the cone-shaped tooth, as a rule perfect in construction, is\r\nfound everywhere in the jaw, but especially in the anterior and posterior\r\npart of the mouth, is of much value in outlining tooth and jaw evolution,\r\nespecially in the degeneracy phase. The upper jaw, being an integral part\r\nof the skull and fixed, is, of necessity, influenced by brain and skull\r\ngrowth; hence degeneracy is more detectable in it than in the lower.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the jaw is toward shortening in both directions. This\r\nshortening will continue so long as the jaw must be adjusted to a varying\r\nenvironment. The jaw of man having originally contained more teeth than at\r\npresent, lack of adjustment to environment produces, from the shortening,\r\ndegeneracy of the jaw and atavism of the teeth. While this may coincide\r\nwith general advances of the individual, it indicates that he is not yet\r\nadjusted to his new environment. The shortening of the upper jaw causes\r\nsupernumerary, cone-shaped teeth to erupt, in mass, at the extreme ends of\r\nthe jaw, as shown in the following figures. Fig. 57 illustrates a\r\ncone-shaped tooth between the two central incisors, forcing them out of\r\nposition. Fig. 58 shows three supernumerary teeth--a cone-shaped tooth\r\nbetween the central laterals, and the cuspids out of position. The left\r\npermanent lateral is at the median line; another cone-shaped tooth remains\r\nin the vault, while the supernumerary left lateral is in place. As many as\r\neight are at times to be observed in the anterior vault. Posteriorly these\r\nteeth are most often noticed in connection with the third molars, usually\r\non a line with other teeth posterior to the last molar. Fig. 59 shows two\r\nsupernumerary teeth in the anterior and two in the posterior part of the\r\nleft arch; the molars have been extracted. Supernumerary teeth are not\r\nconfined to these localities, but may be observed at any point in the\r\ndental arch (Figs. 60 and 61). The primitive cone-shaped tooth is rarely\r\nobserved in the lower jaw. In twenty-six years' practice I have not seen a\r\ncase. The mobility of the lower jaw prevents that mal-adjustment to\r\nenvironment present in the upper. The continual shortening, in both\r\ndirections, of the jaw causes the third molars frequently to wedge in\r\nbetween the angle of the jaw and the second molars, so that eruption, if\r\npossible, is difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe third molar is often absent in the English-speaking and Scandinavian\r\nraces. In 46 per cent. of 670 patients it was missing. Frequently its\r\ndevelopment is abortive. This tooth, in the struggle for existence, seems\r\ndestined to disappear. It is more often absent from the upper than the\r\nlower jaw. When absent, or badly developed, the jaw is smaller and\r\nfrequently teeth irregularities, nasal stenosis, hypertrophy of nasal bone\r\nand mucous membrane, adenoids and eye disorders coexist. Fig. 62 shows\r\nabsence of the left third molar with irregularities of that side of the\r\narch. In Fig. 63 both third molars are seen to be missing. Anteriorly,\r\nthe lateral incisors are most often wanting; 14 per cent. of the laterals\r\nwere wanting in 670 patients. In the progress of evolution man has lost\r\none lateral upon each side of the mouth and the second lateral seems also\r\ndestined to disappear. In Fig. 64 the left lateral incisor has\r\ndisappeared; and in Fig. 65 both lateral incisors are absent. Not\r\ninfrequently does it occur that centrals, cuspids, bicuspids, and even\r\nmolars are absent, even their germs not being detectable. Fig. 66 shows\r\nthree supernumeraries in the anterior part of the mouth and but two\r\nmolars. The absence of the teeth indicates lack of development of germs,\r\ndue either to heredity or defective maternal nutrition at the time of\r\nconception or during early pregnancy.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCrescent-shaped, bitubercular, and tribucular as well as deformed teeth,\r\ntend to be cone-shaped. The malformation of these teeth results from\r\nprecongenital trophic change in dentine development, dwarfing and notching\r\nthe cutting and grinding edges of the second set of teeth, of which a\r\nfamiliar example is the so-called Hutchinson's teeth, usually referred to\r\na syphilitic causation. Hutchinson's position has, however, been more\r\nstrongly stated than his words justify, since he admits that in at least\r\none-tenth of the cases this cause could be excluded.\r\n\r\nSyphilis only plays the part of a diathetic state profoundly affecting the\r\nmaternal constitution at the time of dentine development; while these\r\nteeth may be due to secondary results of syphilis, they do not\r\ndemonstrate syphilitic heredity.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 67 are seen the teeth of an individual affected with\r\nconstitutional disease (referring to Fig. 51 it becomes evident that the\r\ndefective lines represent the respective ages, 2-1/2, 4, and 5 years). The\r\ndegree of pitting will depend, as a rule, on the severity of the\r\nconstitutional disorder. In the case just cited, however, although\r\nnutrition was but slightly disordered, each tooth shows a tendency to\r\nconate. Not infrequently cavities extend completely through the tooth. The\r\ncusps of the (permanent) first molars, calcifying at the first year, are\r\nusually attacked also, and arrested in development, producing the cone\r\nshape. These data, together with the dates of eruption of the temporary\r\nand permanent teeth, furnish an absolute basis for calculation as to\r\nmalnutrition producing excessive or arrested development, not only of the\r\nteeth and jaws but all parts of the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGS. 70, 71.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 68 shows a very degenerate jaw with cone-shaped, malformed\r\nbicuspids. The right lateral missing, the cuspids are erupting in the\r\nvault and the dental arch is assuming a V-shape. The jaw shows, as a\r\nwhole, marked arrest in development. Fig. 69 shows Hutchinson's teeth.\r\nWere the first molars visible, they would present marked contraction of\r\nthe outer surface with a malformed centre. Referring again to Fig. 51, it\r\nis observable that trophic changes affected the system at the age of\r\nbirth. The outer surface exhibits a tendency to take the cone shape. Figs.\r\n70, 71, 72, 73, and the molars in Fig. 66, exhibit malformations that\r\nassume the cone shape and the centre frequently associated with this type\r\nof teeth. The coincidence in form between Hutchinson's and malformed teeth\r\nand those of the chameleon suggests that tropho-neurotic change produces\r\natavistic teeth. Fig. 74 illustrates the tendency of human bicuspids (when\r\nthere is no antagonism) to rotate one-fourth round, thus again indicating\r\nan atavistic tendency toward the teeth of the chameleon. Fig. 75 exhibits\r\nextreme atavism; all teeth anterior to the molars are cone-shaped. The\r\nthird molars are missing and would, probably, never erupt. In Fig. 76\r\nappears more marked atavism. The upper and lower are both cone-shaped, and\r\nthe superior first bicuspid exhibits tendency thereto. The right superior\r\nsecond bicuspid, second and third molars, the right inferior first and\r\nsecond bicuspids, with second and third molars are missing. The same\r\ncondition, probably, exists on the left side. The space in the upper jaw\r\nis due to the insufficient width of the teeth. Alternation of teeth in the\r\nupper and lower jaw is a reptilian feature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 76 furnishes excellent illustration of the principles already stated.\r\nIn degenerate jaws every tooth in the jaw, at one point or another, may\r\ndisplay rudimentary cusps. On the incisors they are always to be found on\r\nthe lingual surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFig. 77 illustrates the centrals with two rudimentary cusps, the laterals\r\nwith one, and the cuspids with one also. Fig. 78 represents cusps upon the\r\nlingual surface of the molars. The cuspids are not unlike the lower\r\ncuspids with a rudimentary lingual cusp.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a gradation from central incisors toward the bicuspids, in\r\nevolution. This grading of form is not observed in passing from the cuspid\r\nto the bicuspid in man. But the cuspid often presents a cingulum on the\r\nlingual face that inclines it toward the bicuspid forms in lower mammals,\r\nlike the mole, and the first premolar, or bicuspid, is then more\r\ncaniniform, the inner tubercle being much more reduced. This inner\r\ntubercle is very variable and erratic as to its position. It appears as\r\nfar front as the centrals and is often present on the lingual face of the\r\nlaterals of man. The lingual tubercle is very constant on the first\r\nbicuspid of man and is as well developed as the buccal. But in some lower\r\nforms, as in the lemurs, it is quite deficient. It attains the highest\r\ndevelopment only in the anthropoids and man. Considering these stages of\r\ndevelopment, the grading from the cuspid to the bicuspid forms was more\r\ngradual in the earlier species than in the later, where the individual\r\nteeth have taken on special development.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe skull of a degenerate girl who died from tuberculosis, at thirteen\r\nyears, presented, among other stigmata, a cusp on the external surface of\r\na right inferior cuspid. In Fig. 79, where every tooth is present, a most\r\nremarkable display of cusps occurs. The cusps upon the cutting and\r\ngrinding edges are not obliterated. Commencing with the left superior\r\ncentral incisors, three cusps are present with a rudimentary palatine\r\ncusp. The laterals also show three cusps, while the cuspid has two very\r\ndistinct. The first and second bicuspids have tubercular cusps, they\r\nbeing in line. The buccal cusps upon the molars, two or three, and are\r\nstill in position. The palatine cusps are worn away. The same is the case\r\nupon the opposite side, except that the cuspid has cusps that have fused\r\ntogether, leaving a small projection upon the mesial side and a\r\nrudimentary palatine cusp. The cusp upon the third molar is lost. In\r\nanother case (Fig. 61) the primitive cone teeth are seen trying to shape\r\nthemselves into incisors. The lateral incisors, cuspids and bicuspids are\r\nstill cone-shaped. The first permanent molar is fairly formed while the\r\nsecond molars are still in a primitive condition.\r\n\r\nDegenerate teeth unite in twos, threes, fours, and fives. These single,\r\ncone-shaped teeth grow together and form bicuspids and molars. The germ of\r\nany two normal teeth may intermingle and unite; not only are the crowns\r\nfound united with separate roots, but crowns and roots are united\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nFigs. 80 and 81 show two superior, central and lateral incisors joined\r\ntogether throughout the entire length of crown and root. In Fig. 82 two\r\nlower incisors are united throughout. Fig. 83 shows a cuspid with two\r\nroots. George T. Carpenter, of Chicago, has a right superior, second\r\nbicuspid with three well formed roots. Fig. 84 illustrates two bicuspids\r\nunited at the crowns. Fig. 85 shows two molars perfectly united. Fig. 86\r\nillustrates central and lateral incisors of the permanent set perfectly\r\nunited. Fig. 87 shows two molars united. Fig. 88 a molar and supernumerary\r\ntaking the cone-shape with deformed centre. Fig. 89 shows three malformed\r\nteeth, each coated and completely united. It is not uncommon to find three\r\nmolars united together, as, for instance, the second, third, and\r\nsupernumerary molars. C. V. Rosser, of Atlanta, Georgia, has two small\r\nmolars and a supernumerary cuspid perfectly united, from crown to root,\r\nand these three further united to the roots of a well-formed molar.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat human jaws, like human ears, are degenerating is demonstrable by\r\nactual measurements. Mummery, who examined the skulls of 200 Briton and\r\nRoman soldiers, found the narrowest 2.12 inches, the highest 2.62, with an\r\naverage of 2.50. The width of jaws of 402 British soldiers to-day is:\r\nnarrowest, 1.88; widest, 2.63; average 2.28. The highest width was very\r\nrare; only eight measured 2.50. The jaws of the mound builders, compared\r\nwith the existing cliff dwellers, show similar results. The average width\r\nis about 2.50 inches. This is also true of nearly pure negro races.\r\nMeasurements of normal jaws of 855 Italians of Central Italy were:\r\nnarrowest, 1.88; widest, 2.63; average 2.17. Measurements of normal jaws\r\nof 4,935 Americans gave the following results: narrowest, 1.75; widest,\r\nonly one case, 2.56; average 2.13. If in the highest type of physical man\r\nthe width of the upper jaw from the outer surface of the permanent molars\r\nnear the gum margin was originally 2.50 inches in diameter, the jaw of\r\npeople now living in the same locality is from 0.25 to 0.33 inches\r\nsmaller. Although the jaw has thus been growing smaller, since there are\r\nno breaks or deformities in the contour of the dental arch this must be\r\nregarded simply as an adaptation to environment, and not degeneracy in the\r\nproper sense of the term. The degeneracy of the jaws, on which I would lay\r\nspecial stress, is that in which deformity has resulted from inability to\r\nadjust structure to a changing environment. When arrest of development so\r\ntakes place that deformities of the dental arch result, the jaws vary from\r\ntwo inches to one inch in width. As a rule, the teeth are the same size\r\nto-day that they were thousands of years ago. This is due to the fact that\r\nthey are ante-natal and not influenced by post-natal systemic changes. The\r\njaws do not contract as a result of mouth breathing.[218] If the jaw be\r\narrested and be smaller in circumference than the teeth, a break takes\r\nplace in the dental arch and deformity results. Two types of deformity\r\noccur, the V-shaped arch and the saddle arch. All other types of\r\ndeformity, not due to local causes, are modifications of these two. These\r\ndeformities always occur with the second teeth only. In these cases the\r\nfacial profile assumes the perpendicular line or arrested face, as\r\nillustrated in the chapter on Degeneracy of the Face. They are never seen\r\nbefore the sixth year, when the second set begin to erupt and are complete\r\nwith development of the second molars at 12. They may become exaggerated\r\nlater in life from want of room, the eruption of the third molar and want\r\nof harmony in relation of the two jaws when closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are three characteristics of the normal arch. Independent of\r\ntemperamental peculiarities, the line extending from one cuspid to the\r\nother should be an arc of a circle, not an angle or straight line; the\r\nlines from the cuspids to the third molar should be straight, curving\r\nneither in nor out, the sides not approximating parallel lines. Absolute\r\nbilateral uniformity is not implied in this, as the two sides of the\r\nhuman jaw are rarely, if ever, wholly alike. A uniform arch necessitates\r\nuniformity of development between the arch of the maxilla and the arch of\r\nthe teeth and a correct position of the individual teeth in their relation\r\nto each other. When there is inharmonious development between the jaws and\r\nthe teeth, as may happen when one parent has a small maxilla with\r\ncorrespondingly small teeth, and the other a large one, with\r\ncorrespondingly large teeth, if the child inherit the jaw of one and the\r\nteeth of the other, irregularities must follow. Such difference in\r\ndiameter between the arch of the maxilla and that of the crowns of the\r\nteeth is a constitutional cause of irregularity. When there is a\r\ndifference between these diameters the line formed by the teeth must\r\neither fall outside or within the arch of the maxilla and irregularities\r\nof arrangements result. The primary division of irregularities is the\r\nV-shaped and saddle-shaped arches. We have the V-shaped variety (Fig. 90,\r\none of the typical forms), where the apex of a triangle is formed by the\r\nincisors, the base of the triangle being a line connecting the first two\r\nmolars. If, because of premature or tardy extraction, the first molars\r\nmove forward, or by coincidence of the arch of the maxilla and the arch of\r\nthe crown of the teeth in trying to accommodate itself to the lesser arch\r\nof the maxilla, the arch becomes a broken line, forming an angle at the\r\nincisors. This angle results from two causes: the thinness of the process\r\nat this point and the diminution of resistance which must follow.\r\n\r\nWhen the permanent bicuspids erupt under a favourable condition, so that\r\ntheir greatest diameter is in a line with the greater diameter of both\r\ncuspids and first molar, they will be held firmly in place, since the\r\ngreatest pressure is on this very line. On the other hand, when the\r\nbicuspids are erupted after their proper time, while the cuspids progress\r\nduly, and meeting no resistance fall into their proper places, but the\r\nbicuspids adapt themselves as best they can to the space left for them,\r\nand if the arch of the maxilla does not coincide with that of the crowns,\r\nthey must fall within or without the arch. Now, if the first molar have\r\nmoved forward, diminishing the space, the bicuspid must erupt either\r\nwithin or without the arch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo understand why they are generally found within the arch, the shape of\r\nthe molar and cuspids must be kept in mind. A transverse section of their\r\ncrowns shows their proximal walls not to be parallel, but wedge-shaped,\r\ntheir diameter being greater on the buccal than on the palatal side. When\r\nthe crowned bicuspid falls within the greatest diameter of these teeth,\r\nfinding more room within the arch, they naturally slip in the direction of\r\nleast resistance, _i.e._, toward the palate. A local cause for the same\r\ncondition is found in the fact that the crown of the bicuspids, before\r\ntheir eruption, was held between the roots of the temporary molars, and,\r\nas these form an arch of a smaller circle than that of the permanent\r\nteeth, the bicuspids will be found generally inside the arch. From both\r\ncauses occurs an inward curvature, which is termed the saddle-shaped arch\r\n(Fig. 91). It should be noted here that, since the V-shaped irregularity\r\nis found anterior to the cuspid, the upper incisors are always projecting\r\nbeyond the lower; the saddle-shaped irregularity is invariably posterior\r\nto the cuspid from an inward curve. The incisors never project. Both forms\r\ncontract the arch; the V-shaped anteriorly, the saddle-shaped posteriorly.\r\nIn both forms the forward movement of the first molar is the local cause.\r\n\r\nDeformities of the dental arch are due, first, to arrest of development of\r\nthe jaws, and, second, in the nature of the deformity, to the order of\r\neruption of teeth, which rarely erupt twice alike. From an evolution\r\nstandpoint these deformities are atavistic. The V-shaped reverts to the\r\nreptilian type; the saddle-shaped to the lower mammals. In the gorilla,\r\nthe nearest to man in dentition, there is a very distinct approach to the\r\nsaddle shape. In the chimpanzee it remains. The orang-outang exhibits less\r\nof this tendency. The arch of some of the cebidae very nearly approaches\r\nman. It all depends upon the extent of prognathism. When that is reduced\r\nthe arch appears and rectangular arrangements of the teeth are lost. Most\r\ncarnivors exhibit a distinct approach to the saddle shape. Some felines\r\nhave a shortening of the jaw, partly obliterating the tendency, but in\r\nmost canidae it is quite marked.\r\n\r\nThese are facts which cannot be overlooked, since, from the very nature of\r\ndevelopment and eruption of the teeth, they cannot take any other form.\r\nThe arrangement of the crowns of the cuspid (canine) in the jaw before\r\neruption is such that, no matter what the local condition of the jaws or\r\nteeth may be the V-shaped or saddle-shaped dental arch must be produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn no symptoms is degeneracy so evident as in the stigmata resultant on\r\nhypertrophy of the alveolar process. This occurs at all ages, but more\r\nparticularly at the period of development of the permanent set of teeth.\r\nThe entire alveolar process may become involved (Fig. 92), or only a\r\nportion (Fig. 93).\r\n\r\nHypertrophy of the alveolar process is the result of irritation incident\r\nupon eruption and the shedding of the temporary teeth, and eruption of the\r\npermanent teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLaryngologists, rhinologists, and neurologists claim that certain vaults\r\nare deformities; in reality the alveolar process is hypertrophied. The\r\njaws, as a whole, owing to an unstable and ill-balanced nervous system,\r\nare liable to become excessively developed, as well as arrested in\r\ndevelopment. Excessive development of the superior maxilla is evinced by a\r\nfulness of the upper lip. In these cases the upper maxilla is too large\r\nfor the lower, and stands out beyond it. The lower may be quite normal.\r\nWhen there is simply a want of proportion between the two jaws, it is due\r\nto the diminutive or excessive size of one while the other is normal. The\r\ncriterion in these cases must be the facial angle. The upper jaw is\r\nusually in harmony with the skeleton, while the lower jaw depends for its\r\nsize largely upon function, its size being the result of accident rather\r\nthan the result of general proportions.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the upper jaw is normal, or smaller than the lower, the extent of the\r\nposterior portion is determined by the occlusion of the first permanent\r\nmolar, which keeps the alveolar processes in permanent relation to each\r\nother at this point and allows freedom of development in front. If the\r\nocclusion be not normal, the upper jaw and alveolar process will develop\r\nlaterally as well as anteriorly. The teeth of the anterior columns may\r\neither stand vertically, or they may be turned in toward the lower\r\nincisors. The latter defect is produced by the action of the lips. When\r\nthe cuspids are in their normal position the upper incisors form a larger\r\narch than the lower, and this permits of their being turned inward; but\r\nwhen the cuspids have moved so far forward that they are not normally\r\ninterlocked with the lower teeth, the incisors are too crowded to permit\r\nthis. While the jaws are growing smaller the teeth tend to cause reversion\r\nto the original form. Arrest of development of the superior maxilla is\r\nalways associated with marked depression at the alae of the nose, producing\r\nthe appearance of having been hollowed out from a point at the floor of\r\nthe orbit to the grinding surface of the lower teeth (Fig. 94).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.]\r\n\r\n\r\nArrest of the lower jaw (Fig. 95) is common among degenerates. This\r\nconsists of a shortening of the body of the jaw. Sometimes it is arrested\r\nto such an extent that there is apparently no chin. About 50 per cent. of\r\ncriminals of Elmira, New York, have this deformity.

One most\r\nstriking condition is that by which development of the bones enclosing the\r\nspinal cord is checked. The spinal cord is at first essentially a\r\nnotochord as in the lowest types of vertebrates. The structures\r\nsurrounding the cord are not divided into vertebrae. This condition is\r\npermanent in the lancelet. Around the notochord is later formed a species\r\nof membrane which protects it, called the perichord. This condition is the\r\nsecond stage of development of the cord and is the permanent condition in\r\nthe lampreys. Later still the cartilaginous vertebrae develop, and then\r\nthese ossify at the point in the perichord which is to form a vertebra,\r\nbows of dense tissue form which unite behind. In front similar bows form\r\nto constitute the bodies of the vertebrae. These bows remain ununited in\r\nsome of the lower fish and at certain stages in the human embryo. As\r\ndegeneracy checks the union of the bows of the vertebrae, imperfection, and\r\neven absence, of the union occur, which is called spina-bifida (Fig. 96).\r\nThis condition when complete is rarely compatible with life. In a partial\r\nstate it is often found among degenerates.[220] The seat of the trouble is\r\nfrequently covered by an excessive development of hair (hypertrichosis),\r\nespecially in the small of the back; this, which occurs very frequently in\r\ndegenerates, resembles the tail which the ancients represented as that of\r\nthe fauns.[221]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the vertebrae unite irregularly, deviations or bends of the spine occur\r\nvery frequently among degenerates. These may be of any of the types known\r\nto surgeons. In man the spinal column terminates in two bones. One of\r\nthose (composed of five vertebrae) begins at eighteen years to unite slowly\r\ninto a single bone called the sacrum. The bones of the sacral vertebrae\r\nform processes similar to those which are formed from the vertebrae of the\r\nchest region. These serve to cover the nerves of the sacral region. The\r\nbone immediately below the sacrum, called the coccyx, is essentially the\r\nrepresentative of the tail in man. At a certain stage of human\r\ndevelopment, as in the tadpole, the tail disappears, the nine vertebrae\r\nforming the coccyx unite together and become a very diminutive bone which\r\nloses nearly all vertebral characteristics. Sometimes this bone retains\r\nits embryonic peculiarities to such an extent that it simulates in some\r\ndegenerates a rudimentary tail. Of this many instances are on record. A\r\ngreater degree of this condition has been found to occur, with comparative\r\nfrequency, amongst the lowest negro races. In this respect these are below\r\nthe anthropoid apes, where the tail, considered from the tail standpoint,\r\nhas degenerated as in man for the benefit of the organism as a whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ribs and breastbone develop from the processes of the vertebrae. It is\r\nprobable that every vertebra originally had ribs. Traces of these exist in\r\nmost vertebrae in the human embryo. In man, as a rule, there are but twelve\r\nvertebrae which develop true ribs. In degenerates, as in the gibbon, a\r\nthirteenth pair sometimes appears. Normally, the two lowest ribs are,\r\nhowever, very imperfectly developed as compared with the other ten, and\r\none is sometimes absent. The rib develops from the ends of the vertebral\r\nbows, which, coming in contact with the muscle plates of their own segment\r\nof the body, are by the resulting bulging forced to expand, and later come\r\ntogether through the formation of the breastbone. Checking of these\r\nconditions produces various deformities of the chest which have been\r\ndivided into \"funnel-shaped\" and \"dropper\" deformities.[222] Frequently\r\nthe entire chest wall is arrested early in life (Fig. 97). The relation\r\nbetween the muscle plates and the course of development of the chest is\r\nillustrated by the fact that an arrest of development of important muscles\r\noften coexists with deformities of the chest. The human limbs are\r\ndevelopments from the fin-folds as found in fishes and the human embryo.\r\nIn one of these the fins are divided into four segments. The upper segment\r\ncontains one long bone, the humerus (or arm bone), or the femur (or thigh\r\nbone). The second segment contains two long bones, the radius and ulna (or\r\narm bones), or the tibia and fibula (or leg bones). The third segment\r\nconsists of nine small bones, the carpals of the wrist or the tarsals of\r\nthe ankle. The fourth segment consists of five separate digits. These\r\nlimbs pass through three stages in embryonic development as to their\r\nposition, which may be designated as amphibian, reptilian, and mammalian.\r\nMany of these bones fuse together (carpals and tarsals). The digits have\r\nlong before the late fish stage been formed of more than one bone. At\r\ntimes this condition persists even after the completion of human embryonic\r\ndevelopment. Limb anomalies resulting from checks of development causing\r\neither excess or arrest of development are far from uncommon among\r\ndegenerates, but are not so common as anomalies of form and proportion.\r\nAmong such anomalies may be mentioned joined limbs (symelia), or the more\r\nor less complete absence of limbs (ectromelia), or the absence of a\r\nperipheric segment (hemimelia), or the complete or partial absence of a\r\ncentral segment (phocomelia). Among the other important degeneracies of\r\nthe limbs are supernumerary digits. These Annadale[223] classifies as:\r\nFirst, a deficient digit loosely attached to the hand or foot or to\r\nanother digit. Second, a more or less developed digit free at its\r\nextremity and articulating with other bones. Thirdly, a fully developed\r\nseparate digit. Fourth, a digit united along its whole length with another\r\ndigit. The first three types have been called polydactylia. The last has\r\nbeen called syndactylia. There is finally a condition in which union\r\nbetween the digits results in the disappearance of some of the fingers and\r\ntoes (Fig. 98). This condition is called ectrodactylia. Supernumerary\r\ndigits to the extent of six fingers and six toes are exceedingly common in\r\nthe families of degenerates. The influence of heredity in this particular\r\nhas been well demonstrated. The Kelleia family of Malta was one of the\r\nearliest reported. The condition may last for five generations,[224] but\r\noften disappears on marriage with normal persons outside the community or\r\nfamily. A family of the Arabian Hyabites, named Boldi, confined marriages\r\nto their own tribe. They all have twenty-four digits. Children born with a\r\nnormal number are killed as being the offspring of adultery. The\r\ninhabitants of Cycaux, France, till the end of the eighteenth century, had\r\nnearly all supernumerary digits either on the hands or feet. Isolated in a\r\nmountainous region, they for years intermarried. On communication being\r\nopened, they emigrated or married strangers, and sexdigitism vanished.\r\nMaupertius reports the case of a German family whose members had\r\ntwenty-four digits for many generations.[225] One of them refused to\r\nacknowledge a normal child. In one instance in the United States\r\nsupernumerary digits lasted through five generations. A case reported[226]\r\nsome years ago was the following: The first instance of the appearance of\r\nthe deformity was in a man, born of a degenerate family in 1752, who had\r\nsix toes on one foot. His son was born with six toes on one foot, but the\r\ndaughter was normal. This daughter had five children; among them were a\r\nson and daughter, each of whom had six fingers on one hand. The\r\ngranddaughter had eight children, including one son with six toes on one\r\nfoot. Another son had two daughters, each having six fingers on each hand,\r\nand one daughter having twenty-four digits. This last girl had three\r\nchildren; the son was doubly deformed like his mother, while a second son\r\nhad six fingers on each hand, the toes being normal. One of the two\r\ndaughters of the fourth generation (with only the hands affected) had\r\neight children, several of whom were normally developed, but the rest were\r\ndeformed as follows: One daughter had an osseous thickening at the end of\r\nthe digits, one son had twenty-four digits, another had twelve fingers,\r\nthe toes being normal in number.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere cited an instance from Kiernan in which unilateral\r\nsexdigitism was found in four generations of Norwegian degenerates.\r\n\r\nNot unfrequently polydactylia is associated with the absence or union or\r\ndecrease in size of bones of the limbs. It happens that the upper or\r\nlower extremities may be increased or diminished disproportionately\r\nthrough the body. This disproportion in size of the fingers and toes is\r\nexceedingly frequent. Big digits (macrodactylia, Fig. 99) are\r\ncomparatively rare, and may only involve a supernumerary bone in the\r\nthumb. Short digits (microdactylia) are much more frequent. This state may\r\nbe constituted by the absence of one bone or the union of two bones, or\r\nthe shortening of metacarpal or metatarsal bones, or the shortness of\r\nseveral phalangeal bones. There may be increased disproportion between the\r\ndifferent fingers. The method of determining this is by comparison with\r\nthe middle finger. This disproportion may vary greatly. Fere is of opinion\r\nthat shortening of all the fingers constitutes a grave mark of degeneracy.\r\nRelative shortness is exceedingly common.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of development of the limbs from the fin-fold, it\r\nfollows that these may be checked completely so that the condition\r\napproximates the earlier development from the fish. On the other hand the\r\nlarge bones of the arm and thigh may be checked while the digits and the\r\ntwo lower bones (radius and ulna, tibia and fibula) go on to full\r\ndevelopment as do the digits. Sometimes the arms develop completely while\r\nthe lower extremity remains in the fin-fold state. On the other hand the\r\narms may be checked and remain in the fin-fold state while the legs go on\r\nto full development. Sometimes the bones of the arm and forearm are\r\nchecked while the digits go on to full development. The lower extremities\r\nare sometimes fused together. This condition, from its resemblance to the\r\nlike state in the seal, is called phocomelia, or seal limbs. They are\r\nalso called sirens, on account of the resemblance to the sirens of\r\nmythology.[227]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOther expressions of degeneracy, albeit sometimes secondary, are club-foot\r\nand club-hands (Fig. 100). In many instances these are retentions of\r\npositions assumed by the limbs of the foetus in the course of evolution,\r\nand are therefore, in the adult, expressions of degeneracy. Club-foot was\r\nan expression of degeneracy which appeared in Byron, the poet, as a\r\nconsequence of the degeneracy present in both the Byrons and the Gordons,\r\nas Kiernan has shown.[228] Commenting on this condition as found in\r\nByron, F. S. Coolidge, of Chicago, remarks: \"Byron undoubtedly suffered\r\nfrom double congenital club-foot, the deformity being worse on the right.\"\r\nWhile in Coolidge's opinion congenital club-foot unquestionably arises\r\nfrom different causes, it is, however, so frequently an accompaniment of\r\nsevere forms of mal-development and of congenital brain defects, that\r\nthere can be no doubt but that imperfect constitutional development is one\r\nof its causes. That the deformity with the many limitations which it\r\ninvolves may tend to create morbidness is very likely to be an additional\r\nsymptom of the degeneracy which, in certain cases, is the underlying cause\r\nfor the deformity. Dareste, who has studied the club-foot and the\r\nclub-hand from the standpoint of experimental teratology, finds that in no\r\nsmall number of cases club-foot and club-hand result from checked\r\ndevelopment. Absence of the kneecap or patella may, as H. N. Moyer has\r\nshown, be an expression of degeneracy.[229]\r\n\r\nThe conditions resultant on checked development may appear in any of the\r\nbony or muscular structures. At times muscles checked in development pass\r\non to conditions present in the lower apes.[230] Sometimes the checked\r\ndevelopment of bones results in artery courses which are present in some\r\nof the lower animals. Just above the bend of the elbow in the embryo is an\r\nopening through which an artery passes in many quadrupeds. In adult man,\r\nas a rule, this has disappeared, but not rarely in degenerates the opening\r\npersists with the artery through it.\r\n\r\nHernias, of all varieties, are noticeably hereditary,[231] but what is\r\nhereditary is not the rupture, but the laxity of the orifice of the cavity\r\nof the abdomen. As descent of the testicles from the abdomen (where they\r\nare embryonically in man and normally in many animals) is often delayed\r\nand even does not occur in degenerates, hernia of the groin variety is\r\nparticularly apt to occur in them. These hernias are often found united\r\nwith defects of the testicles as well as deficiencies of the chest.\r\nDeformities of the nose are also especially apt to coexist with these.\r\n\r\nDegenerate women frequently have supernumerary milk glands arranged on the\r\nabdomen as in some lemurs, while males may have supernumerary breasts of\r\neither male or female type. These breasts may be represented by nipples\r\nalone. In either sex arrested development of the face, middle ear, and\r\npalate often coexists with these supernumerary breasts.\r\n\r\nThe degeneracies of the body combine so frequently with those of the skull\r\nand the brain as to indicate a common origin. Polydactylia is found with\r\nalmost all the degeneracies of the body. It occurs with all the\r\ndegeneracies of the eye, from those which are purely atavistic like\r\ncoloboma to those like retinitis pigmentosa and amauroses, which are\r\natavistic in origin. Hare-lip, cleft palate, and deformities of the jaws\r\nand teeth are often found associated with all the bodily degeneracies and\r\nthe nutritive, intellectual, and moral degeneracies as well. Phocomelia\r\nwith brain deformity has been found associated with them. Anomalies of the\r\ngenital organs are also quite frequently associated with these and with\r\nfinger anomalies. In the subjects of juvenile obesity are frequently\r\nassociated unstable mentality and will-power, and delayed or precocious\r\nsexual maturity. My own observations have shown this condition to be\r\nfrequently associated with the jaw and teeth degeneracies.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from their general significance as stigmata of degeneracy, anomalies\r\nof the external ear have been found frequently associated with\r\nmal-development of lungs, kidneys, liver, and intestines. Hidden\r\nspina-bifida is often associated with the same anomalies, and not rarely\r\nwith irregular development of the genital organs of both sexes. Albinism\r\nor deficient pigment in the skin and hair is not only often associated\r\nwith grave degeneracies, intellectual and moral, but appears combined with\r\nmal-development of the spleen, liver, and kidneys. The opposite state\r\n(melanoderma, or black skin) is often associated with similar deformities,\r\nespecially with early precocity in development. It has also been found in\r\nconnection with hairlessness and irregularities in development of the\r\nteeth and jaws.\r\n\r\nThe deformities of the chest and their resulting interferences with\r\nrespiration are not only associated with conditions like narrowing of the\r\npulmonary artery, of the aorta, and with cardiac deformities, but also\r\nlead to diminution of the respiratory power and, in consequence, to\r\nconditions predisposing to pneumonia and consumption. They are also, as my\r\nown observation has shown, associated with deformities of the face, of the\r\nnose, of the mouth cavity, of the palate, and of the jaws. These\r\nconditions result in mouth breathing and in other conditions which\r\npredispose to the attacks of microbes. The deformities of the arterial\r\nsystem coexisting with checked development of the chest are apt to extend\r\nto the blood vessels of the kidneys, and therefore to retain these in the\r\nembryonic condition, thus predisposing them to disease. To a somewhat\r\nlesser degree this arterial condition coexisting with checked development\r\nof the chest or with the other arrested conditions of development\r\nassociated with it, may extend to the liver in such a degree as to prevent\r\nit destroying the toxins of typhoid fever and allied diseases, thereby\r\nincreasing the dangers from these disorders. The same influence may be\r\nexerted on the spleen and suprarenal capsules, thus interfering with the\r\nphysiologic guards these organs furnish against disease and its results.\r\nNot infrequently do these last conditions tend to give an epileptic\r\ncharacter to degeneracies which would otherwise be destitute of it. With\r\nthe interference with the proper blood supply, due to checked conditions\r\nof the organs named, may occur gout, diabetes, and many forms of\r\nrheumatism with their secondary consequences.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect and irregular action of the lungs associated with the\r\narrests in development of the face, nose, palate, jaws, and chest may\r\nproduce an irregular blood supply to the brain, which will exaggerate the\r\nmental instability of the degenerate.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions which are expressions of degeneracy of the body,\r\ncombined with degeneracy of the head and face, are three conditions known\r\nas infantilism, masculinism, and feminism. Practically all three are\r\narrests of development of the promise of the child type. Owing to the\r\nstruggle for existence which occurs at puberty between the old type of the\r\nchondrocranium and its new type as supplemented by the dermal bones, the\r\nnervous system takes a distorted ply which arrests both the bodily,\r\nnervous, and mental development at certain points. In infantilism the\r\narrest is of the future promise of the child, so that the body and face\r\nremain at the childish point, or the body and nervous system are checked,\r\nor finally the nervous system or certain organs alone are checked while\r\nthe body goes on to full development. Not infrequently the face is\r\narrested at any period from birth to puberty (Fig. 101). Hence the reason\r\nmany persons retain their youthful appearance throughout life. These\r\npeople are often vain and egotistic. The mental stamina is weak, and they\r\nare frequently unreliable, while the females are often prostitutes or\r\nprurient prudes, hysteric reformers or gossip mongers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe female type, from the standpoint of bodily and nervous development,\r\nmost nearly approximates the promise of the child type, and checks of\r\ndevelopment will result in masculinism and feminism. In the first the\r\nfemale has proceeded so far in development as to have female organs and\r\ntheir functions while retaining traces of a predominant character of the\r\nlower male type. In the second, the male has proceeded along the line of\r\nevolution toward the female type, but ere sex has been fixed, further\r\ndevelopment has been checked and the male type is finally assumed as the\r\npredominant one. Both sexes proceed embryologically from an indifferent\r\ntype nearly resembling the hermaphroditic type found in the lower\r\nvertebrates. The arrest of development may therefore take place at any\r\npoint in the embryonic evolution. The male may preserve only the female\r\nbreasts[232] (Fig. 102), while normal in other respects; or, again (Fig.\r\n103), present cryptorchidism or sloping shoulders, and be otherwise\r\nmasculine. On the other hand, his nervous system may have taken such a ply\r\nthat at the period of puberty the sexual instincts may be female in type.\r\nIn some instances, this may extend merely to an extreme modesty toward\r\nmales, to an intense liking for female occupations and disgust for male\r\noccupations. In the female precisely analogous conditions may occur. In\r\ncertain cases the sex side is entirely dormant until awakened at puberty.\r\nEducation of these cases of arrested development may give the sex\r\ndirection rather than any in-born tendency. In one case, a male who had\r\nundergone arrest of development in his evolution towards the female type\r\nwas brought up as a girl, had unusually pleasing womanly qualities; as a\r\nresult was married twice to intensely devoted husbands, and the real sex\r\nwas never even suspected until post-mortem examination revealed that the\r\nsupposed woman was a male. In other cases where the nervous system has\r\ntaken one sexual ply, while the body has taken another, an exceedingly\r\nunfortunate class of beings results. This class of beings needs especially\r\ncareful training during puberty and adolescence. In some instances in\r\naddition to the sexual distortion there exist in these beings conditions\r\nof mental defect and moral obliquity. In the last case they approximate\r\nthe criminal type. In the first case residence in an insane hospital\r\nprotects the community and these beings against themselves. In some\r\ninstances no mental defect nor, in a strict sense, moral obliquity occurs.\r\nHere the patient requires very careful study from every standpoint.[233]\r\nThere is in the higher and lower races a tendency in different directions\r\nas to the predominance of sex. The woman of the lower races more nearly\r\nresembles the male of the race. The male of the higher races more nearly\r\nresembles in structure the female of his race than does this female the\r\nfemales of the lower race. This is in part due, in the course of\r\nevolution, to the intrusion of the male on female occupations, since all\r\noccupations, other than war, hunting, and fishing, were created by\r\nwomen.[234] The male, however, in the higher races, while thus taking on\r\nthe female intellectual and aesthetic qualities, retains the male sexual\r\ncharacteristics, mentally and physically, but in accordance with the law\r\nof evolution, these manifest themselves less explosively as in the case of\r\nthe female. As the victim of masculinism or feminism is a degenerate the\r\nexplosive manifestations are more marked. Every one of the stigmata of\r\ndegeneracy already described may coexist with any one of the three\r\nconditions named: infantilism, masculinism, and feminism.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking manifestations arising from arrest of development\r\nin certain directions with possible hypertrophy in others, are the\r\nconditions known as giantism and dwarfism (_see_ Frontispiece). Both these\r\nconditions may be expressions of atavism to no very remote ancestors and\r\npresent little if any evidences of degeneracy. In other cases degeneracy\r\nmay be well marked, and the condition be due to imperfect gland action,\r\nsuch as disorder of the pituitary body, which causes very frequently an\r\nenlargement of many of the bones of the body, and very often a uniform\r\nenlargement of all the bones. Indeed, as Marie has said, giantism is\r\nacromegaly occurring during the period of adolescence. In many instances\r\nthe opposite condition, dwarfism, occurs during infancy from causes which\r\ncheck the further growth of the body, although the general functions\r\nremain unchanged. Dwarfism is very apt to be attended by preservation of\r\nthe intellectual faculties without evidence of degeneracy, other than the\r\negotism shown in extreme vanity. Moral defects are, however, more apt to\r\noccur in dwarfism than in giantism, in which last condition mental defect\r\nis apt to occur, varying from a simple good-humoured stupidity to\r\nfeeble-mindedness. In proportion as the central nervous system has been\r\naffected will the stigmata of degeneracy appear in both conditions. As the\r\nline between disease and disordered function is not thinly drawn in these\r\ncases, disorders like rickets or local bony tendencies to extensive growth\r\nmay coexist with both conditions. Infantilism is peculiarly apt to occur\r\nwith giantism, and while less frequent in dwarfism it also occurs, but is\r\nthen especially apt to be associated with rickets.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to these conditions are leontiasis ossium and acromegaly,\r\nboth of which are characterised by similar trophoneurotic defects. The\r\nfirst of these conditions may occur precedent to puberty and cease in its\r\ncompletion. Kiernan has observed this in the case of an imbecile on Ward's\r\nIsland, who lived until the age of 75, after spending more than sixty\r\nyears in the charitable institutions of New York. His ancestry was of the\r\ncriminal and defective classes. Acromegaly is characterised by abnormal\r\ngrowth, chiefly in the bones of the head, face, and extremities. As a\r\nrule, the disorder begins at the completion of puberty, although it\r\noccasionally occurs at the onset of the climacteric. The illustration\r\ngiven (Fig. 104) presents the characteristic features of the disease. In\r\nthis case there are local evidences of congenital defect. The prevailing\r\ntrend of opinion is that this condition is due to irregular action of the\r\npituitary body which controls osseous development.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already pointed out in the chapter on Heredity and Atavism, the arrests\r\nof development may affect one side of the body, while the other pursues\r\nthe direct course of development. This may show itself in over-growth, as\r\nwell as in under-growth, on the affected side. The person may appear, even\r\nfrom the centre of the forehead down, as if the halves of the bodies of\r\ntwo different persons had been joined in one. Conditions may vary from\r\nthis extreme type to a state in which a lack of proper nerve and blood\r\nsupply on the undeveloped side predisposes to attacks of disease, as\r\nalready pointed out.\r\n\r\nNot rarely does it happen that acromegaly attacks the side most deficient\r\nin nerve supply. The same is true of allied disorders affecting the growth\r\nof the muscles.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of development may be such that both sides are equally\r\ndefective in nerve supply, so that when acromegaly occurs it may attack\r\nboth sides equally. This is particularly apt to be the case with the lower\r\nextremities, and enlarged feet (Fig. 105) are not an uncommon result.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe feet, in addition to the condition already described as being common\r\nin both extremities, exhibit special stigmata of their own in consonance\r\nwith the evolutionary advance which the foot has shown as compared with\r\nthe hand in man's evolution. In the lower races the hollow of the foot\r\ndoes not exist, and the condition known as flat-foot occurs (Fig. 106).\r\nThis is usually associated with low instep. It occurs among the stigmata\r\nof degeneracy, and is not rarely associated with grave moral defects and\r\nintellectual distortions. It and other feet degeneracies have been found\r\nfrequently among paranoiacs, moral imbeciles, and prostitutes. This is\r\nparticularly true of the prehensile power of the foot.[235]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nDEGENERACY IN REVERSIONAL TENDENCIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hair of the head and body may never develop from the condition of down\r\n(lanugo) present in the new-born. The hair over the sexual organs may\r\nalone remain in this condition, not showing itself at puberty. In women\r\nthe hair may be unusually developed on the face and chest. It may also\r\ncover the whole body, a condition which is normal in the Ainus of Japan.\r\nIt may develop, as already shown, very markedly in the lumbar regions.\r\n\r\nSpeech may be markedly disturbed, reverting to the condition of Haeckel's\r\nHomo-alalus in the shape of deaf-mutism, which is one of the extreme\r\nexpressions of degeneracy. Not less than 93 per cent. of the cases of\r\ncongenital deaf-mutism possess deformities of the head, face, jaws, and\r\nteeth. The mere fact of the exceedingly primitive structure of the\r\ninternal auditory mechanism has abnormal or defective hearing power as a\r\nconsequence. Many cases of congenital deaf-mutism owe their origin to\r\nthis, inasmuch as the auditory mechanism is not in a condition to\r\nappreciate sound, even though the individual may not have been born deaf,\r\nand the whole auditory apparatus subsequently degenerates. A mental\r\ndefect is sometimes superadded, thus aggravating the case. Upon general\r\nprinciples, since deformities of the head, face, jaws, nose, antra,\r\nvaults, &c., are common in neurotics and degenerates, stigmata of the\r\near-bones must occasionally take place. From the complicated structure of\r\nthe ear, lesions must often result from such deformities. The deaf-mutism\r\nhere considered is the result of congenital conditions not produced by\r\ndisease. Dumbness may result from congenital defects of the tongue or\r\ndeformities of the larynx of an atavistic or a degenerate type, but\r\ndegeneracy rarely extends so deeply into the organism as in the case of\r\ndeaf-mutism. No greater error is committed than the confusion of deaf\r\nmutism secondary to ear disease with the congenital type.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent reversional tendencies occur in the genitals. One very\r\ncommon condition is retention of the testicles within the abdomen\r\n(_cryptorchidism_), which has been already pointed out, and may represent\r\nthe last expiring trace of degeneracy. The testicles may, however, be\r\nperfectly normal in structure and function. In the female the uterus may\r\npresent every type of mammalian uterus from the marsupial up. The female\r\nmay also revert (as more rarely the male) to the condition of the reptiles\r\nand oviparous mammals in which the urinary organs and bowels empty into a\r\nsingle opening, the cloaca. This condition has been found in the female\r\noffspring of degenerate families, who are otherwise normal and who have\r\nproduced children, despite the cloaca.\r\n\r\nAnother reversion is the occurrence of breasts without nipples, resembling\r\nthose found in the oviparous mammals. The breasts in degenerates, as\r\nalready shown, are frequently multiple, sometimes because the law of\r\nindividuation is reversed, but more often as a reversion to the\r\nmany-breasted condition (_polymastia_) of the precursor of man.[236] The\r\nhuman kidney and liver may revert not merely in function alone to the\r\nsauropsida, but also in structure.\r\n\r\nThe human heart may present in degenerates all types from the pulsating\r\nvessel found in the lancelet up to that of the mammal. The imperfect types\r\nof these sometimes perform their functions properly, except under strain.\r\nIn other cases mixture of arterial and venous blood results, producing the\r\nso-called \"blue babies.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the teachings of the extreme disciples of Morel, it has been assumed\r\nthat the family of the degenerate tends to irrevocable extinction. On the\r\nprinciple of individuation already outlined from Spencer, degeneracy,\r\nthrough its tendency to generalise rather than specialise function, causes\r\ntoo rapid development of cells which tend to extinguish each other, thus\r\npreventing proper ovulation; and, in the next place, the same condition\r\nprevents proper development of the ovum if formed and fecundated; and,\r\nfinally, causes too numerous simultaneous developments of ova, which would\r\ntend to destroy each other. The same cause produces also premature\r\nextrusion of ova. At the same time, however, under given conditions, this\r\nprinciple also tends to produce reversions in type in the shape of too\r\nfrequently repeated and abnormally multiple births. It has been noted that\r\neven the ancestors of those predisposed to phthisis have numerous families\r\nand many children at a birth albeit most of these die ere reaching the\r\nsixth year. Marandon de Monteyel[237] finds that multiple and frequently\r\nrepeated pregnancies often occur among the families of hereditary\r\nlunatics. This has been corroborated by Kiernan[238] and Harriet C. B.\r\nAlexander,[239] of Chicago, in connection with the hereditary lunatics in\r\nCook County. They found that 90 families of the hereditary insane averaged\r\n11 children each. Six families had 5 children, 4 had 7 children, 8 had 8,\r\n10 had 9, 14 had 10, 8 had 11, 4 had 12, 4 had 13, 4 had 14, 3 had 16, 3\r\nhad 17, 4 had 18, 3 had 19, 5 had 20, and 1 had 21 children, each. Twins,\r\ntriplets, and quadruplets were six times as frequent as among normal\r\nfamilies. Manning has found similar conditions among the hereditary insane\r\nin Australia. Valenta, of Vienna,[240] has noted this also among\r\nepileptics. He reports the case of an epileptic mother who had 36\r\nchildren, including six twins, four times quadruplets, twice triplets. Her\r\ndaughter, also an epileptic, bore 32 children before she was 40, including\r\nquadruplets twice, triplets four times, and twins once. Similar, though\r\nless striking, statistics occur with other classes of degenerates with\r\nproportionate frequency when the sterilising effect of certain diseases to\r\nwhich they are specially liable is taken into account. The general\r\nacceptance of the opinion as to large families being a test of advance in\r\nevolution seems strange when the extent and force of the action of the\r\nprinciple of individuation is taken into account, and when it is\r\nremembered how prolific are the lower vertebrates as compared with the\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThe origin of tumours on the principle now adopted depends essentially on\r\nthat reverse of the principle of individuation, illustrated in plural\r\nbirths.\r\n\r\nOne most striking expression of nutritive degeneracy is haemophilia or the\r\ndiathesis of the \"bleeders.\" This, as Potain has pointed out, is not met\r\nwith except in families which are subject to nutritive or graver\r\ndegeneracies. Dent has shown that definite mental peculiarities,\r\nespecially an inability (stronger than unwillingness) to tell the truth,\r\nare especially common in bleeders.[241] Haemophilia was frequently\r\nencountered in the Valois[242] family, and has been met with in the\r\ndescendants of Ernest the Pious of Hanover. The condition, as Osler,[243]\r\nof Baltimore, points out, is characterised by a tendency to uncontrollable\r\nbleeding, either spontaneous or from slight wounds. The hereditary\r\ntransmission in this disorder is decided. In the Appleton-Swain family, of\r\nReading, Mass., there have been cases for nearly two centuries. Instances\r\nhave already occurred in the seventh generation. The usual mode of\r\ntransmission is through the mother, who is not herself a bleeder, but the\r\ndaughter of one. Atavism through the female is the rule. The daughters of\r\na bleeder, though healthy and free from any tendency, are almost certain\r\nto transmit the disposition to the male offspring. The affection is much\r\nmore common in males than in females, the proportion being estimated at 11\r\nto 1, or even 13 to 1. The tendency usually appears within the first two\r\nyears of life. It is rare for manifestations to be delayed until the tenth\r\nor twelfth year. Families in all conditions of life are affected.\r\nBleeders, like other degenerates, may have large families; the members\r\nusually have fine soft skin. In all probability, as the researches of Cohn\r\nshow, this condition is due to incomplete inhibition, resultant in\r\nexcessive activity of the blood-making organs. Such inhibition is, of\r\ncourse, cerebral, and hence, as a later acquirement, readily affected by\r\ndegeneracy which may find its chief expression in this defect.\r\n\r\nAmong the conditions that have been recognised as an expression of\r\ndegeneracy is gout, which, as Fothergill long ago pointed out, is a\r\nreversion to the condition found in the sauropsidian liver and kidneys.\r\nCullen had previously expressed the opinion that gout is a neurosis. Later\r\nresearches tend to show that this neurosis is one controlling nutritive\r\ntissue change. The condition may occur early in childhood as well as at\r\nthe periods of stress. The same is true of conditions like arthritis\r\ndeformans, all of which may be the sole expression of degeneracy in an\r\nindividual who exhibits many marked stigmata. Another expression of\r\nnutritive degeneracy is the senile atrophy of the skin described by\r\nSouques.[244] In a case of this kind under my care the patient, a\r\ntwenty-six-year-old man, was born with club-foot. He has some musical\r\ntalent. He is a marked degenerate. The skin is thick, coarse, and dry,\r\ngiving him a very old appearance on account of its shrivelled condition.\r\nThe ears are undeveloped, eyes small and sunken; excessive development of\r\nthe cheek-bones; hair coarse and stiff; face arrested in development,\r\npossessing a partial V-shaped arch. The width outside first molar is 2;\r\noutside second bicuspid, 1.75; width of vault, 1.50; height of vault,\r\n.58. One of the prominent features of degeneracy noticed in this case was\r\nthe lack of hair upon the face.\r\n\r\nDisorder of the thyroid produces both dwarfing cretinism, and a\r\nmyxoedematous condition of the subcutaneous tissues, increasing the\r\nquantity of the jelly-like material in these, and therefore approximating\r\nsome conditions found in the invertebrates. Ichthyosis (the skin disorder\r\nproducing the \"fish men\" of shows) is frequently an expression of\r\ndegeneracy, often associated with deficient limbs and monsters in the same\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA condition due to heredity (involving an arterial change called\r\narterio-capillary fibrosis) underlies many disorders like cirrhosis of the\r\nliver, kidneys, and other organs. It is usually an expression of\r\npremature senescence. Certain families for this reason exhibit a tendency\r\nto an early appearance of old age (Fig. 107), a tendency which, as Osler\r\nremarks, cannot be explained in any other way than that in the make-up of\r\nthe machine bad material was used for tubing.\r\n\r\nObesity or lipomatosis is a nutritive expression of degeneracy especially\r\nnoticeable in the second dentition, at puberty, and sometimes at the\r\nclimacteric. As Fere has shown, lipomatosis (first noticed by Cruveilhier)\r\nis an expression of stress at the period of evolution. Youthful obesity\r\noccurs in descendants of degenerates. In my experience it is attended by\r\ngreat liability to disease and systemic weakness when under morbid\r\ninfluence. These lipomatosic children are liable to rheumatism (more\r\nproperly gout) and great hemorrhage from slight causes. Youthful obesity\r\nis sometimes, as Fere remarks, associated with precocious maturity and\r\nresultant early senescence, but more often with extended infantilism, as\r\nin the case of Dickens's \"fat boy.\"\r\n\r\nIn connection with this question of obesity I examined 267 corpulent\r\nschool children and adults. Nearly all had marked stigmata of degeneracy;\r\n92 per cent. had deformed ears to a marked degree; 66 per cent. had\r\narrested development as compared with their age, while 12 per cent.\r\npresented excessive development; 34 were too young to show the final form\r\nand size of the jaw. Of the 34, in about 33-1/3 per cent., the molars,\r\nincisors, cuspids and bicuspids were present; 96 per cent. of these had\r\nsmall teeth. Of the remaining 233, 87 per cent. had arrested development\r\nof the upper jaw, 22 per cent. of the lower jaw, 64 per cent. had V or\r\nsaddle-shaped arches or their modifications and protruding teeth; 17 per\r\ncent. had hypertrophy of the alveolar process; 83 per cent. had small\r\nteeth; 27 per cent. had extra tubercles upon the molars; 82 per cent. had\r\nstenosis of the nasal cavity more or less marked; 36 per cent. had\r\ndeflection of the nasal septum to the left, and 29 per cent. to the right;\r\n21 per cent. wore glasses for eye defects. In 58 per cent. there was\r\nenlargement of the thyroid gland, and in 7 per cent. arrest of development\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the structures of reversionary type that have attracted most\r\nattention of late years is the appendix vermiformis. This, as elsewhere\r\nshown, is a rudimentary offshoot which is extremely variable. Man retains\r\nthis structure as a relic of having been at one time a vegetable feeder.\r\nIn the koala (Australian native bear), a vegetable-feeding marsupial, it\r\nis more than thrice the size of the body. In the carnivora it has entirely\r\nvanished. In man, where it is sometimes absent and sometimes is as largely\r\ndeveloped as in the orang, it is commonly from four to five inches in\r\nlength and about a third of an inch in diameter. The appendix is poorly\r\nsupplied with blood, which predisposes it to attacks by microbes because\r\nof the absence of leucocytes to fight these, and also because being, so to\r\nspeak, a blind ally of the intestine, microbes find in it a suitable\r\nculture medium for them. The secretions of the appendix are very apt to\r\ndecompose: hence a culture medium. The extreme variability of this\r\ndisappearing organ may be judged from the Figs. 108, 109, 110. As it is\r\nbest developed in degenerates, it constitutes in them one source of\r\npredisposition to death from blood poisoning or from sudden shock. The\r\nlocation of this organ also tends to facilitate disease. In degenerates it\r\nmay be situated at any point upon the end of the big bowel, varying from\r\ntwo to three inches. This little bowel is worse than useless in man, being\r\na source of serious danger. It is an instance of checked development of\r\nthe same kind which causes the human liver to take on sauropsidian\r\npeculiarities. Man in this particular as well as the orang is lower than\r\nthe carnivora, who have lost this worse than useless organ. Its tendency\r\nto disappearance in man indicates once more the truth that degeneracy of\r\nan organ is often, through the law of economy of growth, for the benefit\r\nof the organism as a whole.\r\n\r\nI may conclude this outline of human reversionary tendencies by mentioning\r\nthat merycism, or rumination, has been very frequently found among\r\nimbeciles, paranoiacs, hysterics, and epileptics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDEGENERACY OF THE BRAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOne illustration, and a very striking one, of the influence of degeneracy\r\non the brain is the durencephalous child which so often appears in\r\ndegenerate families. Here the cerebral hemispheres and everything but the\r\nmedulla and pons may be absent, while the rest of the body is in a\r\ncomparatively normal state of development. Starting with such an extreme\r\nexpression of degeneracy in the brain, a wide but closely linked range of\r\ndeficiencies may be found in the brain of degenerates, involving even in\r\nsome almost normal individuals more than simple deficiency. What was\r\npointed out by Spitzka,[245] of New York, twenty years ago concerning the\r\nbrain of hereditary lunatics, is equally true of the brains of the other\r\ndegenerate branches of the same tree. The conventional notion associating\r\nidiocy and imbecility with quantitative deficiency of the forebrain only\r\nis, as Spitzka remarked, a very imperfect one. The researches of numerous\r\nobservers have shown that qualitative defects (using the term qualitative\r\nin its wider sense to cover both morphologic and histologic aberrations)\r\nare as common, and are more characteristic features of the degenerate\r\nbrain. These defects may be enumerated under the following heads: 1.\r\nAtypical asymmetry of the cerebral hemispheres as regards bulk. 2.\r\nAtypical asymmetry in the gyral development. 3. Persistence of embryonic\r\nfeatures in the gyral arrangement. 4. Defective development of the great\r\ninterhemispherical commisure. 5. Irregular and defective development of\r\nthe great ganglia and of the conducting tracts. 6. Anomalies in the\r\ndevelopment of the minute elements or neurons (as the cells and\r\nassociating of fibres are now generally called) of the brain. 7. Abnormal\r\narrangements of the cerebral vascular channels. All of these conditions,\r\nseparately or in the combination of several of the features above\r\nmentioned, are occasionally found in the brain of paranoiacs, moral\r\nimbeciles, criminals, deaf-mutes and other degenerates. Of the first type\r\nthe brain (Fig. 111), from the practice of Kiernan, is an excellent\r\nillustration. This brain came from a paranoiac criminal who died in the\r\nChicago (Cook County) Insane Hospital. A very similar brain was observed\r\nby Kiernan in one of the paranoiacs dying in the New York City Insane\r\nHospital. Similar brains have been observed in deaf-mutes[246] whose\r\nmental status passed muster because of the allowance made for mental\r\ndeficiency due to deaf-muteness. A brain showing as great asymmetry was\r\nfound in the case of a French physician of standing who was a member of a\r\nmutual autopsy society. He proved, however, to have had degenerates in his\r\nancestry and had exhibited peculiarities which showed that much of the\r\ndegeneracy due to this ancestry had been corrected by proper training. The\r\ndefects enumerated under Spitzka's second head are also observable in the\r\nillustration given. The gyres are not only asymmetrical as to their number\r\nin the two hemispheres, but also as to their size. The contrast between\r\nthis brain and the ideally normal one of the mathematician Gauss[247]\r\n(Fig. 112) could not well be greater. Both of these as regards complexity\r\nof gyres contrast very decidedly with both the foetal brain given by\r\nBastian (Fig. 113) and the idiot brain (Fig. 114) of a patient of Kiernan.\r\nThe persistency of embryonic features in the gyral arrangement is\r\nexcellently illustrated in Fig. 115, which represents the brain of an\r\nimbecile examined by Spitzka. Here the convolutions in general were few,\r\nlarge, and well marked.[248] The occipital and parietal lobes\r\npreponderated in mass as compared with the temporal and frontal. The\r\nlatter were greatly hollowed out on the orbital face, and the gyri here\r\nfound were few, simple, and atypical. On the whole the convolutions of the\r\nright hemisphere were better marked and the secondary folds more numerous\r\nthan those of the left hemisphere, and the type of the convolutions\r\npresented differences on the two sides. The most pronounced differences\r\nwere exhibited in the island of Reil and in the occipital lobe. The island\r\nof Reil on the left side had fewer and flatter gyri than that of the right\r\nside, and resembled in its general aspect the first impression of the\r\nbrain of an orang-outang. The right island had six folds better marked\r\nthan those of the left side, but their type was more decidedly radiatory,\r\nwhich was in relation with the unusual shortening of the insular field.\r\nThe external perpendicular occipital sulcus which Bischoff never found in\r\nthe adult human brain (but which has been found persistent in a case of\r\nimbecility with moral perversion by Sander and in a sane neurotic\r\nindividual by Meynert) was finely marked upon the right side of the brain\r\nunder consideration. The fissure was very deep, its posterior wall was\r\nslightly bevelled, and covered several secondary gyri of its anterior\r\nwalls. It differed in position from the similar fissures described by\r\nMeynert and Sander in that it did not, as in these cases, unite with the\r\ninternal perpendicular occipital sulcus and thus simulate the arrangement\r\nfound in the anthropoid apes. It was merely the unobliterated external\r\noccipital fissure of the embryo, and, as in the latter, its medial end if\r\nprolonged would have fallen behind the internal perpendicular occipital\r\nsulcus. The anomaly consisted therefore in the preservation of an\r\nembryonic feature. The arrest of development involved the generally better\r\ndeveloped hemisphere. On the left side gyri and sulci were few and simple\r\nbut typical, the external perpendicular occipital sulcus being interrupted\r\nby a broad crossing gyrus. On transverse vertical sections through the\r\nhemispheres the average vertical thickness is found to be the same on both\r\nsides and normal. The great ganglia were of relatively large dimension,\r\nand the white mass of the hemisphere, aside from the internal capsule and\r\nthe other detachments mediating the connection of the cortex with lower\r\ncentres, relatively reduced. The caudate nucleus appeared to be of bolder\r\ncontour on the right side. The right lenticular nucleus presented a larger\r\nsection area by about 25 per cent. than its fellow of the opposite side.\r\nIt was much shorter, however, like the insular territory of the same side,\r\nand in corresponding sections the posterior end of the left lenticular\r\nnucleus was struck while the right was absent. The right nucleus was\r\nrounder, the left more triangular in contour in corresponding altitudes.\r\nThe olivary bodies were asymmetrical, the right one being flatter and\r\nsmoother than the left. On transverse sections no difference between the\r\nolivary nuclei beyond that which occurs in healthy persons could be found;\r\nthe asymmetry was ascertainably one of prominence only. There was one\r\nmorphologic appearance noticeable in the fourth layer of the paracentral\r\ncortex. This consisted of the presence of round bodies comparable to the\r\nnuclei of nerve cells within a thin or no mantle of protoplasm, and\r\npresenting every gradation from the free nuclei of the neurolgia, so\r\ncalled, to nerve cells with imperfect processes. These bodies in the human\r\ncortex represent imperfectly developed nerve cells and are normally found\r\nin the cortex of lower animals. The barren layer or ependyma of the cortex\r\nwas in places twice as thick in this brain as in the brain of normal\r\nbeings. This ependyma is the histologic factor of the enormous weight of\r\nmacrocephalic brains. In a macrocephalic case coming under the observation\r\nof Kiernan, of Chicago, in which the brain weighed 68 ounces, the ependyma\r\nwas five times the normal thickness. The conditions to which Spitzka\r\nrefers are more or less constantly found in degeneracy. The readiness with\r\nwhich any form of the degenerate series may undergo a metamorphosis into\r\nanother in the course of hereditary transmission is not, Spitzka remarks,\r\ninterpretable in any other light than that of the transmission of\r\nstructure defects either intensified or mitigated in the course of such\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTransmission of many of these cerebral defects occurs at the moment of\r\nconception. The embryonic mechanism of these defects, and the influence\r\nwhich foetal and maternal impressions and injuries exert on the\r\ndevelopment of the nerve centres, furnish valuable argument by analogy in\r\nsupport of conclusions regarding the degeneracy group. Embryologists\r\nimitate known natural teratological states of the nerve centres by\r\nartificial methods. By wounding the embryonic and vascular areas of the\r\nchick's germ with a cataract needle malformations are induced, varying in\r\nintensity and character with the earliness of the injury and its precise\r\nextent. More delicate injuries produce less monstrous development. It is\r\nparticularly the partial varnishing or irregular heating of the egg-shell\r\nthat results in the production of anomalies comparable to microcephaly and\r\ncerebral asymmetry. The constancy of the injurious effect of so apparently\r\nslight an impression as the partial varnishing of a structure not directly\r\nconnected with the embryo at all, suggests a most plausible explanation of\r\nmaternal and other impressions acting on the germ. The delicate problems\r\nin this connection may be inferred from the observations of Dareste that\r\neggs transported in railroad cars, and thus subject to the vibration and\r\nrepeated shocks of a railroad journey, are checked in development for\r\nseveral days. A less coarse molecular transmission taking place during the\r\nmaturation of the ovum or its fertilisation, or, finally, during the\r\nembryonic stages of the more complex and hence more readily disturbed and\r\ndistorted human germ, would account for the disastrous effects of\r\ninsanity, emotional explosions, and mental or physical shocks of either\r\nparent on the offspring.\r\n\r\nFor the majority of cerebral deformities the causes of the deformity must\r\nexist in the germ prior to the appearance of the separate organs of the\r\nbody. Artificial deformities produce analogous results because they\r\nimitate original germ defects either by mechanical removal or by some\r\nother interference with a special part of the germ. Early involvement of\r\nthe germ is shown in the fact that the somatic malformation in degeneracy\r\noften involves other parts of the body than the nervous axis: defective\r\ndevelopment of the uro-genital system, deformities in the face, skull,\r\nirregularities of the teeth, misshapen ears and limbs.\r\n\r\nThose who seek for the source of the arrested or perverted brain\r\ndevelopment in the reaction of an abnormally growing and ossifying skull\r\non the skull contents are in error. The premature ossification theory does\r\nnot hold good even for the microcephali; it is to be doubted if it ever\r\nhad any justification in view of the often open character of the sutures.\r\nTaking the well-studied cases of asymmetry, the variability of a single\r\nfactor shows that caution is needed in referring cerebral anomalies to any\r\nsingle influence. In Muhr's case (cited by Spitzka) the atrophic\r\ncerebellar hemisphere was on the same side with the atrophic cerebral\r\nhemisphere. The internal carotid artery of that side was of lesser calibre\r\nand the entire skull half shortened. Here the lagging behind in growth of\r\none half of the skull appears on first sight to explain the retarded\r\ndevelopment of the corresponding halves of the cerebrum and cerebellum. In\r\nview of the atypy of the gyri, however, an atypy not to be explained\r\npurely on mechanical grounds, it is more reasonable to believe that the\r\nimperfect development of certain vascular channels was either concomitant\r\nor secondary to a primitive anomaly of the cerebral hemisphere. The\r\nretarded skull growth would have to be looked upon as a tertiary\r\noccurrence and the cerebellar defect as a final ensuing result. Ordinarily\r\nwith defective development of one cerebral hemisphere the cerebellar\r\ndefect is on the opposite side, herein following the course of the\r\nanatomical connections of that development and of the secondary\r\ndegenerations. The deviation from this rule in Muhr's case was due to the\r\nentering of the abnormal skull-shape, itself secondary to other defects,\r\nas an element influencing brain growth at a special period of development.\r\nAn abnormal shape of the skull, generally associated with a cerebral\r\ndefect, and hence valuable as a physical sign presumably indicating mental\r\nanomalies, may exert an important modifying influence at a late period on\r\nthe contained brain, but the grosser defects in the cerebral architecture\r\nmust antedate the period of skull growth and be deeply planted as an\r\noriginal intrinsic fault in the brain blastema itself. The researches of\r\nHis have shown how important for the definitive shape of the body and its\r\norgans are the position of individual cells, the portion of the germ area,\r\nthe convexity and length of germ curves and the relative rate of growth of\r\ndifferent germ areas. And as the experiments of other embryologists have\r\nestablished the possibility of producing monstrosities analogous to\r\ncerebral defects by altering the conditions ever so slightly, the general\r\nconclusion follows that the fundamental error of development at the\r\nfoundation of malformations associated with degeneracy is to be located at\r\na very early period of embryonic, or possibly of ovuline life. Certain of\r\nthese anomalies are due to a disturbance of the balance between the\r\ngrowth of the epiblast and mesoblast derivatives of the brain, others to a\r\ndisharmony in the development of related associated brain segments; in the\r\nseverer cases both elements are combined.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to perceive the relation existing between a defective\r\nbrain weight, paucity of the gyri, deficiency of properly developed\r\ncortical cells and such an elementary form of mental aberration as simple\r\nimbecility. The subject of the relation between structure and function\r\ngains in interest when we leave this domain of simple mental weakness to\r\nanalyse the relation between structural defects and the positive symptoms\r\nof insanity and degeneracy--that is, moral perversion, mental obliquity,\r\ndelusions, and morbid impulses. Such symptoms are not limited to the\r\nhigher forms of the degenerate series; they occur, though less constantly\r\nand less markedly, in the lower forms.\r\n\r\nC. K. Mills,[249] of Philadelphia, on examination of imbecile, paranoiac,\r\nand criminal brains, found atypical asymmetry as to gyral and fissure\r\ndevelopment present. The features of this atypical asymmetry were the\r\nexistence of a Sylvian fissure shorter on one side than the other, both\r\nabsolutely and comparatively, and also a more vertical direction of the\r\nfissure on one side than on the other, greater exposure of the insula on\r\none side with marked differences in the development of its fissures and\r\ngyri, confluence of the central fissure with the Sylvian on one side only,\r\nand great tortuosity or bridging of the former fissure in one hemisphere,\r\nunusual narrowness, straightness of complication of the precentral or\r\npostcentral gyrus on one side; marked difference in the simplicity of\r\ncomplexity of the frontal lobes, great simplicity of the orbital surface\r\non one side, differences in the parietal fissure as to length and\r\ninterruption, a smaller parietal or marginal or angular gyrus on one side,\r\nvery great difference in the degrees of confluence and interruption of the\r\nfissures in general, exceeding great length vertically of the\r\nsupertemporal or parallel fissure on one side, unusual differences in the\r\nsize of the precuneus and cuneus.\r\n\r\nA. W. Wilmarth,[250] of Philadelphia, Pa., after a careful study of idiots\r\nand imbeciles ranging in intellectual power from the idiot, properly\r\nso-called, to the juvenile criminal, paranoiac, and \"ne'er-do-well,\" finds\r\nthat the brains of these vary greatly along the line pointed out by\r\nSpitzka and Mills. One type of brain in this class of children is very\r\nsimple in its outward configuration. The convolutions are usually coarse,\r\nbut little convoluted and comparatively free from secondary folds. The\r\nfissures tend to assume a confluent type. Another variety, found chiefly\r\namong the lowest grades, might well be termed \"atypic.\" A brain without a\r\ncorpus callosum is a marked example. In the frontal lobe of the right\r\nhemisphere the first frontal convolution is quite regular. Below this from\r\nthe centre of the lobe seven fissures passed in different directions,\r\ncutting the tube into a number of radiating convolutions, entirely\r\ndifferent from its usual appearance. The short fissure of Sylvius (about\r\nthree inches in length) passed upward, turned sharply, and passed almost\r\ndirectly behind. Two parallel gyri curved around its posterior extremity.\r\nThe arrangement of the convolutions of the temporal and parietal lobes\r\nwere so exceedingly irregular and complex that it was impossible to\r\nclassify them. In the occipital lobe, on the contrary, the gyri were\r\ncomplete in number and of regular arrangements. In the left hemisphere the\r\narrangement of the frontal convolutions was more regular, but the temporal\r\nand parietal lobes presented the same complicated area of surface folding,\r\nbearing but little resemblance to the normal brain. The tendency of the\r\nconvolutions to arrange themselves in parallel curves around the posterior\r\nextremity of the fissure of Sylvius was well shown in the brain of a boy\r\nof exceedingly low intellect. The frontal lobes in this brain are\r\nproportionately large; the convolutions straight, especially the third\r\nfrontal, the fissures shallow. In the left temporal lobe they are nearly\r\nobliterated from pressure of fluid in the ventricles. The ascending\r\nfrontal convolution on each side appears to be wanting. On the left side a\r\nlarge bridging convolution crosses the middle of the fissure of Rolando.\r\nConfluence of fissure is a decided feature of idiot brains. Even where\r\nconfluence is not complete, the tendency of the principal fissure to cut\r\nthrough separating convolutions is very evident. Were the cases where\r\nconfluence is nearly complete included, the number would be considerably\r\naugmented. The fissure of Sylvius passed into the fissure of Rolando in\r\none case on both sides, in another on one side only. In two other cases\r\nthey were connected by deep secondary fissures. The interparietalis has\r\nits origin in the fissure of Sylvius in four cases on both sides, in five\r\ncases on one side only. The calcarine fissure passed completely across\r\nthe gyrus frontitatus on both sides in two cases, on one side in four\r\ncases. In one case the first occipital convolution sank nearly beneath the\r\nsurface, the next occipital gyrus projecting over it, forming a parietal\r\noperculum. There also seems to be a strong tendency to form annectant gyri\r\nin the upper part of the parieto-occipital fissure. In no less than six\r\nhemispheres of 15 brains were these supplementary gyri found more or less\r\ncomplete. In one case on both sides, in five cases on one side, the\r\nparieto-occipital fissure cut through the first occipital convolution into\r\nthe interparietal fissure. A tendency of the transverse occipital fissure\r\nto approach the parieto-occipital fissure is very apparent, though in no\r\ncase do they coincide. The folds of the cerebral cortex, from a lack of\r\nthe stimulus of healthy growth, sometimes revert to forms resembling those\r\nfound in other groups of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental factors of thought and action, as Spitzka terms them, are\r\ntwo: perceptions and motor innervation. These are, in other words, the\r\nunits of thought and action. They can be properly referred to nerve cell\r\ngroups as their anatomical seat, and, as far as intellect is in question,\r\nto the cell group represented in the more or less diffused and dovetailing\r\nareas of specialised function in the cortex cerebri (Fig. 116). But the\r\nlargest hemisphere known, with the most crowded and most highly developed\r\nnerve cells, and the most extensive connections with the periphery, and\r\nthe most perfect projection of that periphery in its intricately\r\nconvoluted mass would, functionally speaking, represent nothing but a mass\r\nof pigeon-holed impressions stored away without method and without\r\npurpose, useless to the organism were it not for those arched fibres\r\nuniting the different cortical centres with each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese fibre constitute by far the greater part of the white centrum oval\r\nof the hemisphere. The total transverse section of the crus and the fibre\r\nmasses from the thalamus and basilar ganglia, does not comprise more than\r\none-third of the entire mass. In the lower animal this relation is\r\ndifferent. The projecting fibres, such as those of crus and capsule and\r\nthe great ganglia, are not as massive as in man, but they are nearly equal\r\nto, and in still lower forms exceed, those connecting the gyri with each\r\nother. Hence the chief point of contrast noted on examining a transverse\r\nfrontal section through the cerebral hemisphere of a man and an ape\r\nconsists in the mass of the centrum ovale of Vieussens. The whole\r\nsubstance in man actually appears hypertrophied when compared with that\r\nof lower animals. It is the associating fibres which mainly mediate that\r\ncomplex co-ordination of the separate units of thought and action which\r\nconstitute the anatomical basis of the highest mental functions (Fig.\r\n117). The study of the human mind does not resolve itself merely into an\r\nanalysis of individual faculties such as simple perceptions and motor\r\ninnervations, but above all requires the establishment of their synthesis\r\ninto the complex abstractions on which the ego depends.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither anatomic nor physiologic researches are calculated to demonstrate\r\njust what associating fasciculi or what groups of such fasciculi are\r\nsubservient to any particular co-ordination. Where, for example, the\r\ncortical area for vision overlaps that of the centre for forearm and hand,\r\nthe associating fasciculus underlying the debatable land is subservient to\r\nthe co-ordinations employed in writing and drawing. In like manner a\r\nsimilar associating bond extending from the centre of auditory word\r\nsymbols to that of the tongue and lip centres may be considered a chief\r\nfactor mediating the speech co-ordinations. A child originally has no\r\nadequate notion of distance or perspective, but will, in the first week of\r\nlife, grasp at objects fifty feet away. Its first ideas of space are\r\ngathered from its own skin sensations; it learns to distinguish between\r\nsingle impressions when touching foreign bodies, and associated double\r\nones as when it touches a part of its own body. In great part this may\r\neven be accomplished by an active infant during the last months of\r\nutero-gestation; it has learned thus to separate the conception of its own\r\nbody from the confused chaos which all impressions originally constitute\r\nto the infant; the next lesson is to learn that to reach certain objects\r\nit moves a certain distance, while others are immediately in reach. It\r\nthen discovers, therefore, that the discrimination by the eye is possible,\r\nsince intervening objects which it has learned to measure by its own body\r\nor bodily movements as a gauge permit an approximate judgment of distance,\r\nin aid of which comes experiment in the shape of time requirements, since\r\nto go so far requires such time, while to go further requires a much\r\ngreater. The crude ideas of space at this time must involve areas in the\r\ncortex devoted to motion and to general sensation situated in the Rolandic\r\nregion. Those devoted to visual impressions are largely situated in the\r\noccipital region, and those devoted to time may be located in the frontal\r\nlobes. Further analysis of the more elaborate sense of space possessed by\r\nadults, involving the play of equilibrium and the appreciation of movement\r\nand direction in foreign objects, shows that cortical areas situated in\r\nnearly every part of the hemispheres are subsidiary to it and connected by\r\nfibre tracts of different lengths and courses. It is evident, therefore,\r\nthat the mal-connection of cortical centres is at the root of various\r\ntropho-neurotic, nervous, mental, moral and other perversions exhibited in\r\ndegenerates. Deformity and deficiency of the corpus callosum in some\r\ndegenerates is but an expression of general defect of associating tracts.\r\nConvolutional aberration in others is but an expression of imperfect\r\ndevelopment of end stations and fibre systems. All mental and moral\r\ndisturbances are associated with perversions of the functions of the\r\ncerebral hemisphere, but the converse, that cerebral hemisphere lesions\r\nonly are the essential accompaniments of mental symptoms evinced during\r\nlife, is not true. Lesions of the pons, the crura, and thalami are\r\naccompanied by more or less complete obliteration of consciousness,\r\nblurring of the perception, confusion in the intellectual sphere, even\r\nwhere the lesion is not of such a character as to disturb the neighbouring\r\nganglia by pressure. Two explanations are possible of this phenomenon.\r\nEither the vaso-motor centre for the cortical vessels is under the control\r\nof isthmus ganglia partially, and hence isthmus lesions by irritation or\r\ndestruction of the centre excite or paralyse the vascular tubes of certain\r\ncortical districts, or pathologic interruption of the great nerve tracts\r\ninvolves functional disturbance of cortical end stations. The first\r\nexplanation is applicable in cases where general and widespread\r\ndisturbance, somnolence, excitement, or depression are found. The latter\r\nwhere the disturbance is partial in character. If all avenues of sensory\r\nperception be closed unconsciousness in the way of sleep speedily follows.\r\nInterruption of the perception tracts is followed by corresponding\r\nphenomena, though less extensive when occurring in the isthmus territory.\r\nThat an irritative lesion in the line of the centripetal tracts can\r\ninfluence cortical life is shown by thalamus lesions in which\r\nhallucinations are sometimes present. Here the cause of the hallucinations\r\nis in the lower centre, but the entry of these into the intellectual\r\nsphere can take place only in the cortical termination of that tract,\r\nsince at this point only through the connecting associating tracts can it\r\nbecome a part of the ego.\r\n\r\nMeynert traced an enormous division of the crus directly to the frontal\r\nlobe and the lenticular nucleus, and showed that this portion through the\r\ntransverse fibres of the pons was of necessity connected with the\r\ncerebellum, and that far other functions are to be located in the cortex\r\nthan merely muscular innervation, visual and auditory perceptions. The\r\nrestiform columns derived from spinal fibres enter the cerebellum and\r\nterminate chiefly in its hemispheres. The cortex of these hemispheres is\r\nconnected by radiatory fibres, with the dentated nucleus, which is a\r\nrecipient of fibres of the auditory nerve. The cortex of the cerebellar\r\nhemisphere receives fibres both from the sensorial periphery of the body\r\nand the semicircular canals. From this reception area the transverse\r\nfibres of the pons originate and enter the crus. It is these which enter\r\nthe frontal lobe and lenticular nucleus. In no respect does man so much\r\ndiffer from the ape as in the quantitative development of these\r\nfasciculi. Their development is intimately associated with the mass of the\r\nfrontal lobe, and there is every reason for considering them the channel\r\nof information of the equilibrium and possibly of the senses of space and\r\ntime, on which the scope of the mind is so closely dependent. Lesions in\r\nthese tracts may disturb these sensations, and the entire mental\r\narchitecture may totter with the withdrawal or weakening of so important\r\npillars. The congenital asymmetry of the peduncular tracts observed in\r\ncertain cases of mental and moral perversion are not without bearing on\r\nthe symptoms of those cases. And this explanation would be adjunct to the\r\nprinciple of mal-development of the associating tracts here advanced in\r\nexplanation of other symptoms of these same states. It is a logical truism\r\nthat complex cerebral functions have a complex substratum. Nothing could\r\nbe more unphilosophical, for example, than to speak of \"intellectual\r\ncells\" (Denkzellen) in the cerebral cortex. Simple elements can have but\r\nsimple functions; complex functions require a union of numerous simpler\r\nelements in a complex structural combination.\r\n\r\nSuch symptoms as epileptic explosions are admittedly connected with no\r\ndemonstrable anatomical aberration, and yet when epileptic explosions of a\r\ncertain type are found associated with a cortical lesion they are to be\r\nregarded as symptoms of that lesion. Morbid projects, delusions, and moral\r\nperversion are simply functional perversions of a properly built cerebral\r\nmechanism or the outcome of a visible structural defect. And when the\r\nlatter is palpably attributable to an error in development and occurs\r\nwith a certain constancy in similar cases, a fundamental relation must be\r\nassumed between the defect and the general tenor of the symptoms.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difference clinically between the effect of congenital\r\nand acquired lesions. When porencephaly (a deformity originally studied by\r\nHeschl) dates from infantile or foetal life, imbecility is always present\r\nduring life; but where it is developed in the matured brain imbecility\r\ndoes not necessarily result.\r\n\r\nDeficiencies in the cerebral vascular system underlie the pathological\r\nphenomena on the basis of infantile cerebral paralysis, and allied\r\nhereditary and congenital states. The degenerate conditions in the spinal\r\ncord are essentially those described by Spitzka as occurring in the brain.\r\nVascular states, either as to irregularities in the number of vessels or\r\nin the vessels themselves, underlie, as in the case of the cerebral\r\npalsies, hereditary ataxias and other congenital and hereditary spinal\r\ncord disorders.[251]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDEGENERACY OF MENTALITY AND MORALITY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the mental and moral degeneracies there is a complete transition from\r\nthe durencephalic monster through the microcephalus, the idiot, the\r\nimbecile, and the feeble-minded to the mentally normal individual. Between\r\nthe feeble-minded and the normal individual occurs a group whose general\r\ncharacteristics is, as was pointed out by Magnan, a disharmony and lack of\r\nequilibrium, not only between the intellectual operations, properly\r\nso-called on the one hand, and the emotions and propensities on the other,\r\nbut even between the intellectual faculties themselves. A degenerate may\r\nbe a scientist, an able lawyer, a great artist, a poet, a mathematician, a\r\npolitician, a skilled administrator, and present from a moral standpoint\r\nprofound defects, strange peculiarities and surprising lapses of conduct.\r\nAs the moral element--the emotions and propensities--is the base of\r\ndetermination, it follows that these brilliant faculties are at the\r\nservice of a bad cause, of the instincts and appetites which, thanks to\r\nthe defects of the will, lead to very extravagant or very dangerous acts.\r\nIn other cases the opposite occurs. Degenerates of irreproachable\r\ncharacter show strange defects in their intellect. They often have a\r\nfeeble memory in certain directions. Sometimes they cannot understand\r\nfigures, or music, or drawing. In a word, an otherwise normal individual's\r\nintelligence is lacking as regards certain faculties. The centres of\r\nperception are unequally impressionable, unequally apt to gather together\r\nimpressions, only certain impressions are registered and leave durable\r\nimages; certain relations, certain associations between different centres,\r\nare perverted or even entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\nThe mental stigmata of degeneracy, therefore, may be divided into those\r\ninvolving the moral elements (in which case there is no very striking\r\nintellectual disorder) and those involving the intellectual elements, in\r\nwhich the conditions may be divided into states where intellectual\r\ndisorder alternates with periods of complete lucidity or with neuroses\r\n(periodical insanity, neuroticism, hysteria, and epilepsy), and states in\r\nwhich the intellectual disorder is a permanent quantity (paranoia,\r\none-sided genius, imbecility, and idiocy). Great as is the apparent gap\r\nbetween idiocy and one-sided genius, on the one hand, and between idiocy\r\nand crime, on the other, this gap is, as already stated, filled by\r\nnumerous closely interlinked forms, dependent on the proportionate removal\r\nof checks (which the race has acquired during evolution) on the explosive\r\nexpressions of egotism and mentality. The removal of these checks is\r\ndependent on the removal or weakening of the power of associating tracts,\r\nto which reference has been made in connection with the degenerate brain.\r\nThe idiot, capable only of purely vegetative functions, who would perish\r\nwere food not placed far back in his mouth, is one step lower than the\r\nnormal infant, who is essentially, as has been remarked, an egotistic\r\nparasite. On slightly increased development this idiot, with the powers of\r\na rather low animal, gains food and satisfies its instincts. These\r\ninstincts at this stage may manifest themselves in the explosive manner\r\ncharacteristic of the undomesticated and non-social animals. With these\r\ninstincts may appear others which man has long lost; thus an idiot girl\r\n(who was delivered of an infant when alone) gnawed through the umbilical\r\ncord in the manner of animals, thus effecting separation and preventing\r\nhaemorrhage. At still a higher stage the imbecile may manifest destructive\r\ninstincts, may steal without the signs of remorse displayed by a housebred\r\ndog, or may kill without recognising the results of killing. The intellect\r\nmay be comparatively developed in certain imbeciles in comparison with the\r\nethical defects. For lack of proper associating fibres, the imbecile may\r\nbe unable to acquire those higher associations constituting the secondary\r\nego, in the most elevated sense. To this class ultimately belong the\r\ninstinctive homicides, torturers, sexual criminals and thieves, so\r\nfrequently found among the juvenile offspring of degenerate stock. In them\r\nthe primary ego is strong, and the restraints of the secondary ego, which\r\nperceives the rights of others, weakened or completely absent. This class\r\nforms the germ of the congenital criminal whom no discipline can tame, and\r\nwho is incapable of being taught the dangers of his procedures under the\r\nlaw of the land. Between this class and the paranoiac there is at once a\r\ncurious likeness and distinction. The lack of proper associating powers\r\nprevents the moral imbecile from recognising any rights of others. The\r\nsame lack in the paranoiac prevents him from recognising the force and\r\nrights of other people in opinion. The moral imbecile has lost the\r\ngreatest acquirement of the race in evolution, that acquirement which\r\nfully recognises the secondary ego in accordance with the sublime precept,\r\n\"Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you.\"\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes the division of criminals given by Tyndall is\r\nsufficient. Crime is essentially an anti-social factor, and violations of\r\nlaw can be regarded as crimes only in proportion as they are anti-social.\r\nThe essential character of crime is its parasitic nature. Parasites, in a\r\ngeneral way, may be divided into those which live on their host, without\r\nany tendency to injure his well-being (like the dermodex in the skin\r\nfollicules); those which live more or less at his expense, but do not tend\r\nto destroy him; and, finally, those which are destructive of the\r\nwell-being of man and lack proper recognition of individual rights which\r\nconstitutes the essential foundation of society. The first type is\r\nimpurely represented by the idiots, imbeciles, lunatics, paupers by\r\ndeprivation, blind, crippled, senile, insane, and deaf mutes. Society,\r\neither indirectly or directly, has been the source of the parasitic state\r\nof many of these, and hence, as also in the case of law-made criminals,\r\nsuch parasitism really takes nothing from society. The second class is\r\nrepresented by prostitutes, sexual degenerates, paupers, and inebriates.\r\nSome of these, however, could be put into the third class, among those\r\nmoral lunatics and criminals who fail to recognise that individual rights\r\nconstitute social order. Prostitutes, paupers, and inebriates have this in\r\ncommon, that crime in them has taken the line of least resistance. The\r\ngreat ethical defect in the prostitute is not lack of checks on explosive\r\nsexual propensities so much as the use of these last as a method of living\r\nby her wits. In essence prostitution is the expression of the criminal\r\ntendency manifested by the confidence operator. The researches of\r\nsociologists like Chaplain Merrick,[252] of the Millbank Prison, London,\r\nshow that at least one-half of the prostitutes leave their homes\r\nvoluntarily to take up a \"life of pleasure.\" Pauline Tarnowsky[253] finds\r\nthat in Russia prostitution is crime in women taking the line of least\r\nresistance. The prostitutes, like the other criminals, are divisible into\r\ncriminals on occasion (vice, monetary reasons, &c.), accidental criminals,\r\nlaw-made criminals, weak-willed criminals, and insane criminals. The\r\nproportion of the law-made and accidental criminals among the prostitutes\r\nis much less than among other criminals, as Merrick has shown. Seduction\r\nstands very low in the list of causes. The proportion of the occasional\r\ncriminal type is very large. Pauline Tarnowsky concludes from her\r\nresearches, which my own tend to verify, that the prostitute, as a rule,\r\nis a degenerate being, the subject of an arrest of development, tainted\r\nwith a morbid heredity, and presenting stigmata of physical and mental\r\ndegeneracy fully in consonance with her imperfect evolution. C. Andronico,\r\nof Messina, Italy, arrived some time previously[254] at the same\r\nconclusions as those of Tarnowsky. Tarnowsky found that 44-1/3 per cent.\r\nof the prostitutes had skull deformities, 42-2/8 face deformities, 42 ear\r\ndeformities, and 54 teeth deformities. Andronico found among 230\r\nprostitutes the following anomalies: Flat nose, 20; handle-shaped ear,\r\n35; vicious implantation of teeth, 10; convergent strabismus, 2; facial\r\nasymmetry, 4; prognathism, 7; receding forehead, 35. Grimaldi, in a study\r\nof 26 prostitutes, had similar results to those of Tarnowsky. Lombroso, in\r\nan examination of 50 prostitutes, found exaggerated jaws, 27 times;\r\nplagiocephaly, 23 times; nasal asymmetry, 8 times; exaggerated zygomae, 40\r\ntimes. Tarnowsky found that in 150 prostitutes, taken at random from those\r\nanswering to the necessary conditions (uniformity of race, ability to give\r\ntheir family history and years of residence in licensed houses), there\r\nwere present signs of physical degeneracy in 87. Among the abnormalities\r\nwere oxycephaly, platycephaly, stenocephaly, plagiocephaly, and heads with\r\nmarked depression either at the bregma or the lambda. The majority had a\r\nmarked development of the external occipital protuberance; in an equal\r\nnumber of virtuous women it was present but four times. These and other\r\nanomalies were thus distributed among the 150 prostitutes: Malformation of\r\nthe head (oxycephaly, plagiocephaly, &c.), noticed in 62; development of\r\nthe occipital protruberance, 62; very receding foreheads, 18;\r\nhydrocephalic, 15; various anomalies of the face (prognathism, asymmetry),\r\n64; ogival palatine vault, 38; congenital division of palate, 14; vicious\r\nimplantation of teeth, 62; Hutchinson's and Parrot's teeth, 19; absence of\r\nlateral incisors, 10; Morel ears, 16; defective ears (detached from head,\r\ndeformed, &c.), 47; anomalies of the extremities, 8.\r\n\r\nIn my researches in the same class, with the assistance of Harriet C. B.\r\nAlexander and J. G. Kiernan, the subjects chosen were those committed to\r\nthe Chicago House of Correction. They are the least intelligent of\r\nChicago's professional prostitutes. The number examined was 30. As regards\r\nthe race they included 13 Celtic-Irish, 5 Irish-American, 3 Scandinavian,\r\n1 German, 1 German-American, 2 American, 1 English-American, 1\r\nLatin-Swiss, 2 Negro.\r\n\r\nIt should here be remembered that the \"fine\" system of Chicago places only\r\nthe \"obtuse\" class in the Bridewell. One was seventeen years old, two\r\neighteen years, one nineteen years, five between twenty and twenty-five\r\nyears, three between twenty-five and thirty, six between thirty and\r\nthirty-five, five between thirty-five and forty-five, one was forty-six\r\nyears old, two were fifty-five, three sixty-one, and one sixty-five. There\r\nwere eighteen blondes, ten brunettes, and two negroes. Four were\r\ndemonstrably insane and one was an epileptic.\r\n\r\nIn sixteen cases the zygomatic processes were unequal and very prominent.\r\nThere were fourteen other asymmetries of the face. Three heads were\r\nMongoloid (one Irish-Celt, one Swiss, and one Scandinavian). There are\r\nMongoloid race types in the regions where all three come from. Sixteen\r\nwere epignathic and eleven prognathic. In one there was arrested\r\ndevelopment of the lower jaw, and in four arrested development of the face\r\nbones. The nose was abnormal in six. There were sixteen brachycephalic and\r\nthirteen mesaticephalic skulls. There were no dolichocephalic skulls.\r\nThere were three with oxycephalic skulls, of whom one was a Celt, one a\r\nGerman, and one a Scandinavian. There were eighteen dome-type skulls, of\r\nwhom seven were Irish-Celts, five Celtic-American, one English\r\nAnglo-Saxon, one American Anglo-Saxon, and one German-American. There were\r\nfour tectocephalic skulls, of whom one was an Irish-Celt, one an\r\nAnglo-Saxon American, and one a Scandinavian. There were three\r\nplatycephalic skulls, of whom two were Celts and one a Scandinavian. There\r\nwas a plagiocephalic German and a stenocephalic Celt. One skull had a\r\nprotuberance at the bregma. Twelve occiputs were flattened, and in four of\r\nthese there was no tubercle; eighteen had an enormously developed\r\noccipital protuberance. The percentage of deformities of the jaws was\r\nlarge. Twenty-nine had defective ears. Normal ears were present only in a\r\nmember of a family which had furnished one mother and two sisters to the\r\ninstitution.\r\n\r\nThe direct hereditary history of prostitutes is excellently illustrated in\r\nMarie Duplessis, idealised by Alexandre Dumas in _La Dame aux Camelias_.\r\nHer paternal grandmother, who was half prostitute, half beggar, gave birth\r\nto a son by a country priest. This son was a country Don Juan, a peddler\r\nby trade. The maternal great-grandmother was a nymphomaniac, whose son\r\nmarried a woman of loose morals, by whom a daughter was born. This\r\ndaughter married a peddler, and their child was Marie. She had the\r\nconfidence-operator tendencies of many of her class. She died childless,\r\nearly in life, from consumption.[255] With their ancestry, habits,\r\nperverse instincts, prostitutes cannot be cured or reformed by the\r\nenforcement of municipal ordinances. Though those of criminal and\r\ncongenital type be taken from their surroundings and placed where they can\r\nearn an honest livelihood, they soon go back, voluntarily, to their old\r\nmode of life.\r\n\r\nAn allied class, belonging to a still blacker phase of biology, are the\r\nsexual perverts. The congenital form associated with the stigmata of\r\ndegeneracy, as already shown, is an expression of the defective line\r\nwhence the victim has sprung. The congenital types are, like the similar\r\ntypes of the prostitute, victims of inherited defects. The sexual pervert\r\nmay be divided into precisely the same classes as other criminals. The\r\ncongenital type often links degenerate lunatics, epileptics, &c., with a\r\nborn criminal class.\r\n\r\nBetween the criminal and the insane is a debatable line occupied by moral\r\nimbeciles, reasoning maniacs, &c. There are many insane persons in whom\r\nthe principal deviation from the normal consists in disorder of the moral\r\nfaculties. In most closer inspection generally reveals signs of\r\ndegeneracy. The seeming immorality is the striking factor of the case and\r\nsuperficially the mind otherwise appears clear and rational by contrast.\r\nAs Krafft-Ebing has shown in these cases, the most striking features are\r\nmoral insensibility, lack of moral judgment and ethical ideas, the place\r\nof which is usurped by a narrow sense of loss or profit, logically\r\napprehended only. Such persons may mechanically know the laws of morality,\r\nbut if such laws enter their conscience these persons do not experience by\r\nany real appreciation, still less regard, for them. These laws to them are\r\ncold, lifeless statements. The morally defective know not how to draw from\r\nthem motive for omission or commission. To this \"moral colour-blindness\"\r\nthe whole moral and governmental order appears as a mere hindrance to\r\negotistic ambition and feeling, which necessarily leads to negation of\r\nthe rights of others and to violation of the same.\r\n\r\nThese defective individuals are without interest for aught good or\r\nbeautiful, albeit capable of a sentimentality which is shallow cant. Such\r\npersons are repellent by their lack of love for children or relatives, and\r\nof all social inclinations, and by cold-hearted indifference to the weal\r\nor woe of those nearest to them. They are without other than egotistic\r\ncare for questions of social life or sensibility to either the respect or\r\nthe scorn of others, without control of conscience and without sense or\r\nremorse for evil. Morality they do not understand. Law is nothing more\r\nthan police regulation. The greatest crimes are regarded as mere\r\ntransgressions of some arbitrary order. If such persons come in conflict\r\nwith individuals, then, hatred, envy, and revenge take the place of\r\ncoldness and negation, and their brutality and indifference to others know\r\nno bounds.\r\n\r\nThese ethically defective persons, when incapable of holding a place in\r\nsociety, are often converted into candidates for the workhouse or the\r\ninsane hospital, one or the other of which places they reach after they\r\nhave been, as children, the terror of parents and teachers, through their\r\nuntruthfulness, laziness, and general meanness, and in youth the shame of\r\nthe family and the torment of the community and the officers of the law,\r\nby thefts, vagabondage, profligacy, and excesses. Finally, they are the\r\ndespair of the insane hospital, the \"incorrigibles\" of the prisons, and\r\n(Krafft-Ebing might have added) the veritable burdens of the poor-house.\r\nIf intellectual insanity or crime do not claim them, pauperism or\r\ncriminality is likely to be their destiny. The moral imbecile may,\r\nhowever, keep within the law, and as in the instance of the \"Napoleon of\r\nFinance,\" cited elsewhere from Kiernan, may achieve business success. His\r\ndescendants often, however, evince degeneracy in an aggravated form. Many\r\nof the supposed reformers of various alleged social evils are often of\r\nthis class. Their morbid egotism takes the direction of cant and\r\nsentimentality, so common at certain states in evolution, as points of\r\nleast resistance. Like Guiteau, the assassin of President Garfield, they\r\naim at doing a \"big thing for humanity and myself,\" the humanity being\r\nconcentrated in \"my\" ideas. The moral lunatic needs but a slight twist\r\nintellectually to become the paranoiac in whom there is, as Spitzka has\r\npointed out,[256] a permanent undercurrent of perverted mental action\r\npeculiar to the individual, running like an unbroken thread through his\r\nwhole mental life, obscured, it may be, for these patients are often able\r\nto correct and conceal their insane symptoms, but it nevertheless exists,\r\nand only requires friction to bring it to the surface. The general\r\nintellectual status of these patients, though rarely of a very high order,\r\nis moderately fair, and often the mental powers are sufficient to keep the\r\ndelusion under check for practical purposes of life. While many are what\r\nis termed crochety, irritable, and depressed, yet the sole symptoms of the\r\ntypical cases of this disorder consist of the fixed delusions. Since the\r\nsubject matter of the delusion is of such a character that these patients\r\nconsider themselves either the victim of a plot or as unjustly deprived of\r\ncertain rights and position, or as narrowly observed by others, delusions\r\nof persecution are added to the fixed ideas, and the patient becomes sad,\r\nthoughtful, or depressed in consequence. The patient is depressed\r\nlogically, as far as his train of idea is concerned and his sadness and\r\nthoughtfulness have causes, which he can explain, and which are intimately\r\nallied with that peculiar, faulty grouping of ideas which constitutes the\r\nrendezvous, as it were, of all the mental conceptions of the patient. Nay,\r\nthe process may be reversed, and the patient, beginning with a\r\nhypochondriac or hysteric state, imagines himself watched with no\r\nfavourable eye. Because he is watched and made the subject of audible\r\ncomments (hallucinatory or delusional), he concludes that he must be a\r\nperson of some importance. Some great political movement takes place; he\r\nthrows himself into it, either in a fixed character that he has already\r\nconstructed for himself, or with the vague idea that he is an influential\r\npersonage. He seeks interviews, holds actual conversation with the big men\r\nof the day, accepts the common courtesy shown him by those in office as a\r\ntribute to his value, is rejected, however, and then judges himself to be\r\nthe victim of jealousy or of rival cabals, makes intemperate and querulous\r\ncomplaints to higher officials, perhaps makes violent attacks upon them,\r\nand being incarcerated in jail or asylum, looks upon this as the end of a\r\nlong series of persecutions which have broken the power of a skilled\r\ndiplomatist, a capable military commander, a prince of the blood, an agent\r\nof a camarilla, a paramour of some exalted personage, or finally the\r\nMessiah Himself. All through this train of ideas there runs a chain of\r\nlogic and inference in which there is no gap. If the inferences of the\r\npatient were based on correctly observed facts and properly correlated\r\nwith his actual surroundings, his conclusions would be perfectly correct.\r\nFor years and years many such patients exhibit a single delusive idea as\r\nthe only prominent symptom. There is hereditary taint in most of these\r\nsubjects, who are strange in disposition from infancy. As children they\r\nfrequently shun society and indulge in day-dreams. Their bodily growth is\r\nnormal, but even trifling disease takes on a cerebral tinge. They may show\r\ntalent in special directions, but their intelligence rarely passes out of\r\nthe puerile stage. They often brood over a feminine ideal, a girl who has\r\nnever encouraged them, and whom they persecute with absurd plans of\r\nmarriage.\r\n\r\nConnecting the paranoiac with the moral imbecile are the so-called\r\n\"reasoning maniacs.\" Here the intellectual power is less than either that\r\nof the moral imbecile or of the paranoiac, twisted though the intellect of\r\nthe latter be. Loquacious or unusually taciturn, heedless or morbidly\r\ncautious, dreamers, wearisome to all brought in contact with them,\r\ncapricious and unmitigated liars, their qualities are often, in a certain\r\nmanner, brilliant, but are entirely without solidity or depth. Sharpness\r\nand cunning are not often wanting, especially for little things and\r\ninsignificant intrigues. Ever armed with a lively imagination and quick\r\ncomprehension, they readily appropriate the ideas of others, developing or\r\ntransforming them and giving them the stamp of their own individuality.\r\nBut the creative force is not there, and they rarely possess enough mental\r\nvigour to get their own living. Passing without the slightest transition\r\nfrom one extreme to the other, they felicitate themselves to-day on an\r\nevent which they sneered at the night before. In the course of a single\r\nsecond they change their opinions of persons and things, novelty\r\ncaptivates and wearies them almost in the same instant. They sell for\r\ninsignificant sums things they have just bought, in order to buy others\r\nwhich, in their turn, will be subjected to like treatment; and, strange to\r\nsay, before possessing these objects, they covet them with a degree of\r\nardour only equalled by the eagerness they exhibit to get rid of them as\r\nsoon as they become their own. To see, to desire, and to become\r\nindifferent are three stages which follow each other with astonishing\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\nThe intense egotism of these persons makes them, as W. A. Hammond remarks,\r\nutterly regardless of the feelings and rights of others. Everybody and\r\neverything must give way to them. Their comfort and convenience are to be\r\nsecured though every one else is made uncomfortable or unhappy; and\r\nsometimes they display positive cruelty in their treatment of persons who\r\ncome in contact with them. This tendency is especially seen in their\r\nrelations with the lower animals.\r\n\r\nAnother manifestation of their intense egotism is their entire lack of\r\nappreciation of kindness done them or benefits of which they have been the\r\nrecipients. They look upon these as so many rights to which they are\r\njustly entitled, and which in the bestowal are more serviceable to the\r\ngiver than to the receiver. They are hence ungrateful and abusive to those\r\nwho have served them, insolent, arrogant, and shamelessly hardened in\r\ntheir conduct toward them. At the same time, if advantages are yet to be\r\ngained, they are sycophantic to nauseousness in their deportment towards\r\nthose from whom the favours are to come.\r\n\r\nThe egotism of these people is unmarked by the least trace of modesty in\r\nobtruding themselves and their assumed good qualities upon the public at\r\nevery opportunity. They boast of their genius, their righteousness, their\r\ngoodness of heart, their high sense of honour, their learning and other\r\nqualities and acquirements, and this, when they are perfectly aware that\r\nthey are commonplace, irreligious, cruel, and vindictive, utterly devoid\r\nof every chivalrous feeling, and saturated with ignorance. They know that\r\nin their ratings they are attempting to impose upon those whom they\r\naddress and will even subsequently brag of their success.\r\n\r\nIt is no uncommon thing for the reasoning maniac, still influenced by his\r\nsupreme egotism and desire for notoriety, to attempt the part of reformer.\r\nGenerally he selects a practice or custom in which there really is no\r\nabuse. His energy and the logical manner in which he presents his views,\r\nbased as they often are on cases and statistics, impose on many people,\r\nwho eagerly adopt him as a genuine overthrower of a vicious or degrading\r\nmeasure. Even when his hypocrisy and falsehood are exposed he continues\r\nhis attempts at imposition, and when the strong arm of the law is laid\r\nupon him, he prates of the ingratitude of those he has been endeavouring\r\nto assist, and of the distinctiveness and purity of his own motives.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to that instability of inter-association resulting in loss of\r\nproper checks on action in the types just described, is the sentimentalism\r\nwhich often covers real hardness, but which charms and allures the mass.\r\n\r\nThis has essentially the same psychological basis as the suspicional\r\ntendencies and pessimism with which it is so often associated. Suspicional\r\ntendencies arise from states of anxiety resultant on instability of\r\nassociation, dependent on lack of associating fibres. Pessimism (so\r\nfrequently present in the otherwise healthy degenerate) is often, as\r\nMagalhaes has shown, nervous instability with alternations of irritability\r\nand prostration. The subject is supersensitive; impressions call forth\r\nintense and prolonged reactions followed by exhaustion. The state is\r\ncharacterised by a general hyperaesthesia, which naturally results in an\r\nexcess of suffering. From instability and hyperaesthesia results discord\r\nbetween the feelings themselves, between the feelings and the\r\nintelligence, between the feelings, the ideas and volitions. Discord\r\nbetween the feelings shows itself in a great variety of paradoxes,\r\ncontradictions, and inconsistencies. To the pessimist possession of a\r\ndesired object does not atone for former privation. Pain or unsatisfied\r\ndesire is replaced by the pain of _ennui_. With inability to enjoy what he\r\nhas are coupled extravagant expectations regarding that which he does not\r\nhave. He is extremely susceptible both to kindness and to contempt. He\r\npasses suddenly from violent irritability to languor, from self-confidence\r\nand vanity to extreme self abasement. His intense sensitiveness results in\r\nintellectual disorders. For this involves a great vivacity of the\r\nintuitive imagination, which favours the setting up of extravagant ideals,\r\nlacking in solid representative elements. Hence a gap opens between his\r\nideal and the actual. He can never realise the ideal he pursues and so his\r\nfeelings are of a sombre hue. From this excessive realism results a state\r\nof doubt, a certain distrust of all this rational objective knowledge. It\r\nassumes another form in extreme subjectivism. The pessimist is haunted by\r\nimages of the tiniest religious scruples, suspicions, fears, and\r\nanxieties, resulting in alienation from friends, seclusion, misanthropy.\r\nThe pessimist is further characterised by an incapacity for prolonged\r\nattention, a refractory attention and a feeble will. These result in\r\ninaction, quietism, reverie, self-abnegation, abolition of the\r\npersonality, annihilation of the will, amounting sometimes even to poetic\r\nor religious ecstasy. Pessimism is frequently associated with a morbid\r\nfear of death. The tramp is one phase of the degenerate in whom the\r\nrestless wandering tendencies of the neurasthenic and paranoiac are added\r\nto the parasitic tendencies of the pauper, and the suspicional egotism of\r\nthe \"reasoning maniac.\"\r\n\r\nThe one-sided genius is a link between the neurotic, the epileptic, the\r\nparanoiac, the hysteric, and the imbecile. Cases crop up in which all\r\nthese elements are so mingled as to create a puzzle where they shall be\r\nplaced. In some cases, in accordance with the general law that physiologic\r\natrophy is accompanied by hypertrophy in other directions, the\r\nintellectual powers other than along certain lines may be remarkably\r\ndeficient. Moreover, the intellectual power due to healthy atavism is\r\nincreased by the degeneracy in certain directions. Without going into the\r\nquestion, raised by Lombroso,[257] as to genius being an epileptoid\r\nneurosis, sufficient evidence exists to show that ill-balanced genius\r\noften coexists with defects in a large number of directions. The\r\ncoexistence of genius with imbecility and even idiocy has been well\r\nillustrated by Langdon Down, who cites numerous instances thereof.[258]\r\nDefect in genius, whether of the imbecile stamp or otherwise, accompanied\r\nby deficiency, is not expressed in the genius, but in its deficient\r\naccompaniment. Even the mental instability of the highest type of\r\ndefective genius is closely akin to that of the neurotic.\r\n\r\nThe hysterics, as has been shown by Des Champs,[259] are neurotic women in\r\nwhom an aggravated sensibility exists. Neurotic women are divisible into\r\nthree categories according to the predominance of one of three\r\ncentres--cerebral, genital, and neuropathic. These types may be pure or\r\nintermixed. The general characteristics are an absolute want of\r\nequilibrium in sensibility and will power. There exists mobility of humour\r\nin direct relation with facile impressionability to external influences or\r\nto internal states. The nerves vibrate to all sentiments coming from\r\nwithin or without, and all are registered without proper relation. One\r\nfact chased by another is forgotten. Another produces a momentary\r\nhyperexcitation, which takes place of the truth, whence it is that\r\nfalsehood is instinctive, but the patient protests her good faith if\r\naccused of the same. This lack of equilibrium leads to a decided\r\nmodification of the mental faculties. Intellectual activity is over\r\nexcited, but in diverse degrees and variable ways, according to the\r\nparticular tendencies adopted. Absorbed by a preoccupation or controlled\r\nby an idea, they become indifferent to all else. Their ideas are abundant,\r\nand they rapidly pass from the idea to the act. Their vivid imagination,\r\ncoupled with a bright intelligence, gives them a seducing aspect, but\r\ntheir judgment is singularly limited, attenuated, or false. They judge\r\nfrom a non-personal standpoint excellently. They are quick at discovering\r\nthe faults of even their own relatives, but faults rightly attributed to\r\nthemselves are repudiated. Their memory is capricious. They forget their\r\nfaults and their acts under impulse, albeit these may be consciously done.\r\nThe cerebral type is led by the intelligence. She has little or no\r\ncoquetry; what coquetry there may be is the result of intention and\r\ntemporary. There is an ethical sense, frankness and nobility in her ideas,\r\ndisinterestedness and tact in her acts, and she is capable of friendship.\r\nHer tastes carry her to male pursuit, in which she succeeds. She becomes\r\noften what is called a \"superior woman,\" and too often what is called an\r\n\"incomprehensible woman.\" She has but little guile. To the sensual type\r\nvoluptuousness is the aim of life and the centre of her acts and thoughts.\r\nShe is well endowed with guile and extremely diplomatic. She is full of\r\nfinesse, but not very delicate. Her lack of scruple often spoils her tact.\r\nShe is ruseful, dissimulating, and unconsciously mendacious. She despises\r\nfriendship and needs watching. If circumstances permit she loses all\r\ndelicacy, reserve and modesty. She is destitute of scruples. Her crimes\r\nare coolly remorseless. The neuropathic type is one to which the\r\ngrasshopper is a burden. Her nerves are always on edge. She is a heroic\r\ninvalid who displays the air of a martyr about trivialities.\r\n\r\nThe character of the neurotic, as Kiernan remarks, recalls the observation\r\nof Milne-Edwards concerning the monkey character. Levity is one of its\r\nsalient features, and its mobility is extreme. One can get it to shift in\r\nan instant from one mood or train of ideas to another. It is now plunged\r\ninto black melancholy and in a moment may be vastly amused at some object\r\npresented to its attention.\r\n\r\nNeuroticism in man differs in no respect from that in woman except that\r\nanaesthesia, paralysis of emotional origin, and conscious convulsions are\r\nless common. The male neurotic could be subdivided precisely as Des Champs\r\nhas the hysteric. Neurotics are often long-lived, peculiarly resistant to\r\ncertain acute and fatal disease, and are frequently retentive of their\r\nyouthful appearance, which is to a certain extent an evidence of their\r\nresistance to the wear and tear of life and advancing old age, and due to\r\nemotional anaesthesia. Recognition of the neurotic tendency often induces\r\nthe individual to take better care of himself. The youthful appearance may\r\nbe due largely to arrest of facial development at an early age, the face\r\nthus retaining the child character throughout life. Considering,\r\ntherefore, this class of neurotics, which does not include those afflicted\r\nwith the more serious nervous disorders such as epilepsy, they may be\r\nlooked upon as the victims of evolutionary processes that are constantly\r\ngoing on in the race and under civilised conditions.\r\n\r\nNeurotics are not met with to any extent among barbarous races, but are\r\nnumerous in civilised communities, where the weak are preserved from early\r\ndeath and then subjected to the struggle for existence. Neurotics are\r\nindividuals naturally imperfect in some directions, but by the law of\r\neconomy of growth they are often superior in others. Their disordered\r\nnervous functions and hyperaesthesia are not, necessarily, indicative of\r\ninferiority of general organisation compared to their ancestry. They may\r\nsimply imply a more rapid advance in some one direction in the development\r\nof the nervous system than can be kept up with by the remainder. These\r\ndefects may in some cases be the advance guards in the progress of the\r\ndevelopment of the race.\r\n\r\nAs the nervous system controls nutrition in all departments of the\r\norganism, anomalies occur with erratic nervous functions in such\r\nindividuals. In these neurotics are often found defective development\r\ninvolving the bony and other structures. They have fine and delicate\r\nfeatures, small jaws and defective teeth. These are the results of general\r\nsystemic modifications connected with the neurotic state. The arthritic\r\ndiathesis occurs also; it is one of the underlying conditions of many\r\nneurotic manifestations, often responsible for acquired bony deformities,\r\nnot infrequently involving the jaws to some extent.\r\n\r\nNeurotic degenerate symptoms from a mental standpoint are noticeable long\r\nbefore deformities of the osseous system are developed. They show\r\nthemselves in mental weakness, extreme stupidity, and precocity. Under the\r\nfirst class the child is obstinate, quarrelsome, malignant, even immorally\r\ninclined, and is often spoken of as being wicked or vicious. Harriet C. B.\r\nAlexander[260] says the ruling instinct in the child of three or four is\r\nself-gratification. It destroys what it dislikes. Among the earliest\r\nmanifestations of morbid mental activity in childhood are hallucinations,\r\nwhich depend on already registered perceptions.\r\n\r\nIn many instances even moral agencies produce sudden explosions of mental\r\ndisorders. The inherited tendencies of childhood predispose to these\r\nattacks. As Clouston has shown, neuroses and psychoses not requiring\r\nhospital treatment are by no means uncommon in the too sensitive child\r\nwith hereditary taint. Children of this class have crying fits and\r\nmiserable periods on slight or no provocation. As Clouston has also shown,\r\nprecocity, over-sensitiveness, unhealthy strictness in morals and religion\r\nfor a child, or too vivid imagination, want of courage, thinness and\r\ncraving for animal food, are common characters. These children are\r\nover-sensitive, over-imaginative, are too fearful to be physiologic, and\r\ntend, as a general thing, to be unhealthily religious, precociously\r\nintellectual, and at first hyperaesthetically conscientious.\r\n\r\nThe other class of children, as a rule, are very handsome babies and\r\nchildren. The brightness is noted by parents at a very early age, and they\r\nextol their many clever qualities and sayings. The tendency is for the\r\nparents to cultivate these precocious qualities and believe it to be the\r\nproper thing to encourage them; while in early life this class may possess\r\nthe peculiarities of the other class and also show those of degeneracy.\r\nThese children are the best scholars in the schoolroom and learn their\r\nlessons with apparently little or no study. They are usually thin, frail\r\nchildren, and very nervous. Very little food is taken and much of that is\r\nnot assimilated. Especially is this true of the lime salts, which form\r\nbone and tooth structure. These lime salts are excreted through the\r\nkidneys and salivary glands. This is easily demonstrated by an examination\r\nof urine, mouth, and teeth. Large collections of tartar are always found\r\nin these cases. Children of both classes are sure to show stigmata of\r\ndegeneracy. This period of degeneracy commences at the sixth year, or at\r\nabout the time the first period of brain development ceases. The bulk of\r\nthe brain has obtained its growth. In some the child commences to improve\r\nmentally very fast. In others mental development is slow. In still others\r\nit ceases altogether. From the time the second set of teeth begins to\r\ndevelop until the twelfth year, neuroses of development and stigmata of\r\ndegeneracy are stamped upon the head, face, nose, jaws and teeth, and\r\nlater any of the conditions mentioned under the heads of nutritive\r\ndegeneracy and local perversion tendencies may appear.\r\n\r\nClosely akin to these states are expressions of degeneracy manifesting\r\nthemselves with some approach to regularity in periods, as in epilepsy and\r\nthe periodical insanities. The periodical insanities may be simply\r\nemotional states of exaltation (as in mania), of extreme depression (as in\r\nmelancholia), of stupor, or of mental confusion. They may show themselves\r\nin periodical acts, as in dipsomania. This condition differs from the\r\ncondition called inebriety in the fact that it is a periodical expression\r\nof degeneracy whose form has been accidently determined, but which would\r\nexist even were its form changed. The differences are excellently outlined\r\nby Dana,[261] who divides intemperate drinkers into four classes:\r\nPeriodical inebriates or dipsomaniacs, pseudo-inebriates, common drunkards\r\nand victims of delirium inebriosum. The disease in the first class is a\r\nperiodical insanity. In the pseudo-inebriates the desire for drink is\r\nonly one of many manifestations of a weakened constitution or inherently\r\nunstable nervous system. The third type are those which approximate the\r\noccasional criminals. Another periodical insanity is kleptomania, in which\r\ninsane stealing occurs at intervals of greater or lesser regularity.\r\nNymphomania or satyrasis is a periodical insanity in which there is an\r\ninsane impulse for sexual intercourse. Pyromania is a periodical tendency\r\nto commit arson. All of these periodical conditions may occur alone or in\r\ncombination with other degeneracies.\r\n\r\nClosely related to the periodical insanities are the epileptic states\r\nwhich play so large a part in many of the phenomena presented by the\r\ndegenerates. In the epileptic the mental rather than the gross nervous\r\nexpression merits attention. From what has already been said about\r\nepilepsy, it and the periodical insanities are in no small degree the\r\neffect of mal-development of the fore brain as compared with the centres\r\nof organic life. The great convulsive centre is, according to\r\nSpitzka,[262] the reticular grey matter of the brain isthmus, particularly\r\nof the pons and medulla. All characteristic features of the full epileptic\r\nonset can be produced in animals deprived of the related cerebral cortex.\r\nIt needs but a slight puncture with a thin needle to produce typical\r\nconvulsions in the rabbit, and some of the convulsive movements reported\r\nby Nothnagel have not only shown the true epileptic character but also\r\nthat peculiar automatism noted in aberrant attacks. It is in this segment\r\nof the nervous system that all the great nerve strands conveying motor\r\nimpulses, both of a voluntary and automatic and some of a reflex\r\ncharacter, are found united in a relatively small area, and just here a\r\nrelatively slight irritation might produce functional disturbances\r\ninvolving the entire bodily periphery.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of physiologists have shown that if a sensory irritation\r\nof a given spinal nucleus be kept up, after having produced a reflex\r\nmovement in the same segment, any reaction beyond the plain of that\r\nsegment is not in the next or succeeding planes but in the medulla\r\noblongata. The motor reaction then manifests itself in laughing, crying,\r\nor deglutitory spasms, and, if the irritation be of the severest kind,\r\nepileptic or tetanic spasms in addition. Now the occurrence of laughing,\r\ncrying, or deglutitory spasms could be easily understood if the molecular\r\noscillation induced by the irritation were to travel along the associating\r\ntracts from the given spinal segment to the nuclei of the medulla\r\noblongata. For in the medulla are found the nerve nuclei which preside\r\nover the facial, laryngeal and pharyngeal muscles. It is not easy at first\r\nto understand how tetanus and epilepsy, that is, spasms consisting in\r\nmovements whose direct projection is not in the medulla oblongata but in\r\nthe cord, can be produced by irritation of the former.\r\n\r\nThere are scattered groups of nerve cells in the medulla oblongata which\r\nhave either no demonstrable connection with the nerve nuclei, or are\r\npositively known to be connected with the longitudinal associating\r\nstrands. These cells hence can safely be regarded as representing a\r\npresiding centre over the entire spinal system. No spinal centre exerts\r\nany influence even remotely as pronounced as that of the entire cord.\r\nThis applies to man and other mammals. That the elaboration of the\r\nmedullary centre was as gradual a process as that of other higher\r\ndifferentiations is illustrated by the case of the frog, whose medulla has\r\nacquired the faculty of reproducing general spasms while the spinal cord\r\nitself retains this property also; hence here the predominance of the\r\nmedulla is not so marked as in mammals.\r\n\r\nThe reticular ganglion of the oblongata is not in the adult a part of the\r\ncentral tubular grey matter, but has, through originally developing from\r\nit in the embryo, become ultimately isolated from its mother bed. It\r\nconstitutes a second ganglionic category, and the association fibres\r\nbringing it in functional union with the spinal grey (first category) in\r\nlower animals and shown to have assumed the position of projection fibres\r\nin the higher, constitute a second projection tract; both together are a\r\nsecond projection system. The scattered grey matter of the medulla has\r\ngreat importance. Anatomically it is (though its cells be scattered\r\ndiffusely as a rule) a large ganglion with numerous multipolar cells of\r\nall sizes, many of them gigantic, sometimes exceeding the so-called motor\r\ncells (which they simulate in shape) of the lumbar enlargement in size.\r\nScattered in the \"reticular substance\" of the medulla from the upper end\r\nof the fourth ventricle to the pyramidal decussation, they merit the\r\ncollective designation of reticular ganglia.\r\n\r\nThe cells of the reticular formation are known to be connected with the\r\nnerve nuclei, on the one hand, and with longitudinal fasciculi, which,\r\nsince they run into the cord, terminate either in the grey matter or the\r\nnerve roots directly, for nerve fibres do not terminate with, as it were,\r\nblind ends. Now in the mammalian brain the reticular ganglion lies\r\nscattered among fibres which come from the higher centres, and the\r\ninterpellation might be made whether, after all, the reticular ganglion be\r\nnot a mere intercalar station for fibres derived from a higher source.\r\nOriginally the ganglion was an independent station. In reptiles this body\r\nof cells is too considerable to account for a termination in them of the\r\nfew cerebral fibres possessed by these animals. And, on the other hand,\r\nthe vertical strands are notably increased in their passage through the\r\nfield of the medulla oblongata.\r\n\r\nThe medulla oblongata with its reticular ganglion seems to be the great\r\nrhythmic centre. In fish the movements of the operculum and mouth, in\r\nsharks those of the spiraculum, in perenni-branchiate amphibians the\r\nbranchial tree, in the infant the suctorial muscles, in all vertebrates\r\nthe movements of deglutition, of the heart and respiratory muscles, all\r\nmovements presenting a more or less regular rhythm, are under the control\r\nof the medulla oblongata. The early differentiation of this part of the\r\ncerebro-spinal axis is related to the manifestations of rhythmic movements\r\nin the embryo and their predominant importance in lower animals. The\r\npossibility should not be excluded that a rhythmic movement may be spinal,\r\nnay even controlled by peripheral ganglia (heart of embryo). A higher\r\ndevelopment, however, implies the concentration of rhythmic innervations\r\nat some point where that anatomical association may be effected which is\r\nthe expression of the mutual influence these movements exercise among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nTwo sets of phenomena must be borne in mind in studying the physiological\r\npathology of the epileptic attack. First, the condition of the epileptic\r\nin the interval. Second, the explosion itself. Too much attention is paid\r\nto the last, too little attention to the first. The constitutional\r\nepileptic is characterised by a general deficiency of tone associated with\r\nexaggerated reaction and irritability. Thus the pupils are at once widely\r\ndilated and unusually mobile. The muscular system, though generally\r\nrelaxed, manifests exaggerated reflex excitability. The mental state is\r\ncharacterised at once by great indifference and undue irascibility. In the\r\nsame way the vascular system is depressed in tone in the interval with\r\nrapid marked changes under excitation. The state of the nervous system as\r\na whole Spitzka forcibly compares to that of an elastic band which, being\r\non the stretch continually, is apt to rebound violently when one end is\r\nlet go. Under normal circumstances the band is less stretched and hence\r\nnot as liable to fly so far when the check is removed.\r\n\r\nAn irritation which, in health, produces restlessness of the muscular\r\nsystem, accelerated respiration and pulsation and various mental phenomena\r\nwithin the normal limits, in the epileptic results in more intense\r\nphenomena in the same direction. The nervous irritability of the epileptic\r\nmanifests itself in one direction especially. An important vaso-motor\r\ncentre for the brain vessels exists, possibly diffused through an area\r\nsomewhere between the thalamus and subthalamic region above the pyramidal\r\ndecussation below. The irritability of this centre results in sudden\r\narterial spasm in the carotid distribution (so characteristic a feature of\r\nthe fit onset); simultaneously with the contraction of the vessel the\r\npupil undergoes an initial contraction, and relaxation instantly results\r\nin both cases. The sudden interference with the brain circulation produces\r\nunconsciousness, and destroys the checking influence of the higher centres\r\non the reflexes in a manner analogous to any shock affecting the nerve\r\ncentres. In the meantime, while there has been a sudden deprivation of\r\narterial blood and a sinking of intracranial pressure so far as the great\r\ncerebral masses are concerned, there has been as sudden an influx of blood\r\nto the unaffected district of the vertebral arteries whose irrigation\r\nterritory is now the seat of an arterial hyperaemia. The result of this is\r\nthat the great convulsion centre, the medulla, being over-nourished,\r\nfunctional excess, that is, convulsion, occurs unchecked by the cerebral\r\nhemispheres, which are disabled by their nutritive shock. The\r\nunconsciousness and coma of epilepsy more resemble shock than they do\r\ncerebral anaemia or syncope. The impeded return circulation of venous blood\r\nnow comes into play. The contraction of the neck muscles explains this\r\nobstruction and especially the accumulation of venous blood in the\r\ncerebral capillaries of the medulla.\r\n\r\nTrue epilepsy presents an enormous number of sub-groups, exhibiting every\r\nvariety of deviation from the ideal convulsive form, and the existence of\r\nthese forms tends to demonstrate the views just expressed. In ordinary\r\npetit mal the initial arterial spasm has but to be confined to the surface\r\nof the hemispheres, leaving the thalamus ganglia undisturbed, and it can\r\nreadily be understood how the momentary unconsciousness or abolition of\r\ncortical function can occur without the patient falling, his automatic\r\nganglia still carrying on their functions. At the same time with the\r\nlesser spasm there would be a less extensive sinking of intracranial\r\npressure with less consecutive collateral hyperaemia of the lower centres\r\nand therefore no convulsion.\r\n\r\nIn certain cases the arterial spasm fails to affect the entire cortical\r\nsurface simultaneously; some one trunk may be more pervious, and as afflux\r\nof blood may occur in its special field where certain impressions and\r\nmotor innervations are stored, the result will then be that the function\r\nof the relatively well-nourished territory will be exalted. If it be a\r\nvisual perception territory, sights, colours or luminous spectra will be\r\nseen; if it be an olfactory territory, odours will be smelt; if a tactile\r\ncentre, crawling, tingling and cold sensation are felt; if a speech\r\ncentre, cries, phrases, and songs may be observed. This explains the\r\nmanifold epileptic aura, which is simply an isolated, exaggerated, and\r\nlimited cortical function. The recurrence of the aura is readily\r\nexplicable on the ground of the well-known physiological law that any\r\nnervous process, morbid or normal, having run through certain paths, those\r\npaths will be the paths of least resistance for that process to follow in\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nThese conditions will be greatly exaggerated in proportion to the\r\ndeficiencies in the associating tracts and will often, in turn, pervert\r\nthese. The sexo-religious and other mental states of epilepsy often\r\nclosely mimic normal mentation and serve to disguise the intense depth of\r\ndegeneracy which epilepsy implies.\r\n\r\nIn their explosive, unchecked character the morbid restlessness of the\r\nneurotic, hysteric, and criminal depend upon like brain disorder to that\r\nof the epileptic, except that consciousness is not involved, and with\r\nconscious acts are intermingled those preceding from the lower automatic\r\nprocesses described. Consciousness, however, is sometimes lost in part,\r\nwhence frequently the defects so often noticed in the thoughts of the\r\ndegenerates.\r\n\r\nThe two following cases which have come to my notice illustrate the\r\nobliteration of the function of limited areas of the brain. A young lady,\r\naged 22, of refinement and highly accomplished, was engaged to be married.\r\nOne evening her _fiance_ called; she failed to recognise him and he\r\nremained ever after a stranger to her. In every other respect her mind was\r\nseemingly normal. She died of tuberculosis. In another case a young lady,\r\nan expert stenographer, while riding her wheel, fell striking her head\r\nagainst a stone. She remained unconscious for some days, and was quite ill\r\nfor three or four months. After her recovery she was much surprised to\r\nfind that she knew nothing about her former employment, although her brain\r\nwas perfectly normal in other respects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince, as Weismann[263] admits, interference with the nutrition of the\r\ngerm plasm will result in the production of variations, the fact is\r\nevident that even according to the Weismannian principle the nutrition of\r\nthe parents will determine the power of the embryo to pass through the\r\nvarious embryonic stages up to the developed child. Impairment of\r\nnutrition may check this development at any standpoint, and may thus\r\nproduce any or all of the defects due to degeneracy. Weismann has no doubt\r\nabout the inheritance of a \"tuberculous habit whose peculiarities are\r\ncertainly transmissible.\" Practically, therefore, even according to\r\nWeismann, that most emphatic critic of the transmission of hereditary\r\ndefect, a condition of nervous exhaustion is produced in the parents which\r\nmay be transmitted as a whole to the offspring, or may simply so affect\r\nthe ovum as to produce various arrests in development with hypertrophies\r\nelsewhere. The influence of nervous prostration in the father may be\r\novercome by conditions in the mother tending to help development. As her\r\nshare in the germ plasm is most emphatic, not only at the time of the\r\nformation, but also during the entire development of the embryo,\r\nproduction of degeneracy will largely depend on her nutrition. The\r\ninfluence of healthy atavism is much more emphatically exerted through the\r\nfemale, albeit even in the male it may overcome the nervous exhaustion of\r\nthe ancestor so far as reproduction of it is concerned.\r\n\r\nWhile many are called, few, owing to healthy atavism, are therefore chosen\r\nfor complete degeneracy. Although heredity plays a large part in the\r\ndegeneracy of the individual, still environment in many cases exerts a\r\ngreater influence in determining, according as it strengthens or weakens\r\nhealthy atavism, the depth of degeneracy. Treatment, therefore, both of\r\nthe individual and of the family is largely a question of prophylaxis or\r\nprevention.\r\n\r\nIn prophylaxis of the family the first indication is to stop the\r\nproduction of degenerates. Two measures have attracted considerable\r\nattention, and from their seeming simplicity have met with much favour.\r\nThe first is regulation of marriage. This, as a means of preventing\r\ndegeneracy, has been much over-estimated. Laws claiming to regulate\r\nmarriage have ignored two factors. In the first place the graver\r\ndegeneracies only are taken into account. From what has been shown as\r\nregards the tendency of the degenerate to intermarry, and from the fact\r\nthat restraints on marriage inevitably result in illicit relationships of\r\npermanent character (equally productive of degenerates whose defects have\r\nbeen increased by the condition in which they are born), the only\r\nprocedure likely to be of value in this relation is to regard marriage\r\nsimply as a contract designed for certain ends and permit its annulment\r\nfor fraud, for concealment of defects (intentionally or otherwise)\r\nincompatible with the procreation of healthy children. In its essence this\r\nis the English common law theory. Its principle is recognised by the\r\ndivorce codes of various continental European countries. Furthermore, it\r\nis on this principle that the Pope not infrequently annuls marriages,\r\ndivorce not being recognised by the Church of which he is the head. It is\r\ncertainly best for the stability of the family that unhealthy unions\r\nshould have the least permanency possible.\r\n\r\nAnother element in prophylaxis, castration, ignores completely the rights\r\nof individuals under the English common law (and, so far as the United\r\nStates is concerned, a provision of its constitution). Although\r\nsacrificing these important guards against that degeneracy in the body\r\npolitic which inevitably reflects itself in degeneracy in the individual,\r\nthis procedure fails to accomplish its end, since it ignores completely\r\nthe principle of transformation in heredity. The distance between the\r\ncriminals (whom it is proposed to castrate) and the hysteric offspring of\r\ngood family is not so great that the progeny of one will not be as\r\ndegenerate as the progeny of the other. Whatever may be said of the value\r\nof this procedure as a deterrent, its use as a prophylactic is\r\ncomparatively small.\r\n\r\nMuch better results are obtainable by guarding women from the factors of\r\ndegeneracy during puberty and during matronhood. Many nations whose laws\r\nostentatiously regulate marriage in a manner most oppressive to individual\r\nliberty entail by their customs over-work in a spasmodic manner during\r\npuberty and during matronhood. Nations whose customs permit women and\r\ndogs to be harnessed together as beasts of burden, to carry the hod and to\r\ndig trenches for sewers, gas, and waterpipes, cry out very loudly against\r\nthe dangerous license of the English-speaking nations in permitting women\r\nto intrude on male occupations. There is no doubt but that women (and it\r\nmay be said a large majority of men) are now through evolution unsuited to\r\noccupations involving spasmodic expenditure of force, and well suited to\r\nthose implying continuity. As Bachhofen, Reclus, and Otis T. Mason have\r\nshown, two-thirds of the occupations of this last type have been created\r\nby women. Man, as Havelock Ellis demonstrates, in accordance with the law\r\nof evolutionary advance, is adjusting himself to these occupations.\r\nAttempts to regulate employment of women in unhealthy trades are a step in\r\nthe right direction so far as prevention of a factor of degeneracy is\r\nconcerned, since it can be carried out without that disregard of personal\r\nliberty which is more dangerous in such attempts at regulation than the\r\ndefect to be regulated.\r\n\r\nThe periods of menstruation and pregnancy in degenerate women require\r\n(from what has been said on maternal impressions) special attention suited\r\nto the individual, and not prescribed indiscriminately for all classes. An\r\nexcellent illustration of the dangers of Procrustean prescription is the\r\ninstance where the vegetarianism of the mother during pregnancy was\r\nfollowed by the production of ill-nourished offspring. Diet during\r\npregnancy undoubtedly can exercise a great influence for good, but this\r\ndiet must ignore the \"longings\" of pregnant women, which are simply the\r\nbulimia, or abnormal appetite for food, produced by irritation of the\r\nmedulla.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the toxic factors the question of legal regulation of the\r\nopium and alcohol habits requires attention. There is very little doubt\r\nbut that the routine prescription of alcohol and opium (in the shape of\r\nparegoric and soothing syrup) by the laity for painful menses, teething,\r\ntoothache, &c., underlies many cases of degeneracy in the offspring. This\r\nprescription is the more dangerous because it is recommended in the hidden\r\nguise of nostrums by hysterics with blatant alcoholophobia. One of the\r\nmost energetic female advocates of the legal prohibition of alcohol\r\nbeverages endorsed very emphatically the nostrum of one of her hysteric\r\nsupporters which contained 50 per cent. alcohol and 1 per cent. each of\r\ncocaine and morphine. As the persons largely under the influence of such\r\nendorsement were hysterics whose zeal for reform was largely an expression\r\nfor desire for notoriety, the dangers of its use during menstruation\r\ncannot well be over-estimated. To reach this serious source of degeneracy\r\nfrom alcohol and the narcotics, statement on each bottle of the exact\r\ncomposition of nostrums should be exacted by law.\r\n\r\nGovernment could exercise a potent influence for good on alcohol abuse by\r\nimprovement of sanitary conditions in the tenement or apartment house\r\ndistricts. Experience in New York and elsewhere has shown that improvement\r\nin tenement houses produces decided decrease in the number of dram shops\r\nin tenement-house neighbourhoods. The earlier tenement-houses in New York,\r\nas elsewhere, were originally dwellings intended for one family. As these\r\nwere replaced by houses specially built for tenements, with proper\r\nsanitary arrangements and improved ventilation, not only did a tremendous\r\ndecrease occur in the infantile death-rate, but a decrease also in the\r\npatronage of dram shops. In many instances it was apparent that alcoholic\r\nabuse had grown out of poverty. Foul air and crowded quarters had begotten\r\nnot only a desire for stimulants but a desire for social intercourse. The\r\ndram shop met social needs as a club. It is along this line that\r\nGovernment can make best use of its police powers.\r\n\r\nThe Government, in exercise of its police powers directed to sanitary\r\nends, could enable the trade unions to secure improved sanitation in shops\r\nin which occupations unhealthy by themselves or because of environment,\r\nare carried on. In this way improved sanitation of unhealthy occupations\r\ncould be best secured.\r\n\r\nThe prophylaxis of degeneracy in the mother and father may be summed up as\r\nsimply the prevention of a state of neurasthenia, or nervous exhaustion,\r\nwhether this condition (involving the functions of growth, motion and\r\nsensation, which, as Marinesco has shown, exist in every neuron and its\r\nprocesses) exhibit itself in the general nervous system or in the organs\r\nconnected with alimentation, elaboration, and excretion. Every factor of\r\nacquired degeneracy produces what is practically this condition of\r\nneurasthenia ere exerting any influence in the production of degeneracy.\r\nIn other words, the neurasthenia of the ancestor becomes the neurosis of\r\nthe descendant. Therefore the neurasthenia requires in its treatment in\r\nthe ancestor the removal of the exciting cause and the treatment of the\r\neffect by physiologic rest in the truest sense of the word. In a general\r\nway, therefore, the ordinary principles of hygiene applied to each\r\nindividual case will suffice to prevent development of this neurasthenia.\r\nThe part of Government in this is very small. It is true here that, as\r\nremarked by Johnson--\r\n\r\n  \"How small of all that human hearts endure,\r\n  That part which kings or laws can cure!\"\r\n\r\nTraining of the individual rather than governmental regulation must be the\r\nfactor to prevent degeneracy in the ancestor. Indeed governmental\r\nregulation by injuring self-reliance (that factor so easily destroyed and\r\nso hardly regained) may itself be a potent factor in degeneracy.\r\n\r\nProphylaxis of degeneracy in the individual should commence with the birth\r\nof the child. Whatever may be said of hypothetical ante-natal training,\r\nthere is no doubt that considerable benefit can be accomplished during the\r\nfirst months of life. As the great aim of training is to secure\r\nself-control, it must be obvious that to accustom an infant to expect\r\nattention at every moment it cries, whether the cry be the expression of\r\nneed or not, is to weaken, not to strengthen, its self-control.\r\nFurthermore, regularity in bodily functions is a great source of strength.\r\nThe child can be trained during the first months of life by careful\r\nattention to its wants on the one hand, and as careful inattention to its\r\ncaprice on the other, so that all its functions become equably regular and\r\nautomatic. With this regularity many of the factors underlying caprice,\r\npeevishness, and anger can be prevented in the earliest months of life.\r\nUnless there be enormous deficiency in the associating fibres a good start\r\ncan then be made toward the creation of a secondary ego. It is at this\r\nperiod and during that of the first dentition that training is too often\r\nneglected or perverted in such a way as to strengthen the primary ego at\r\nthe expense of the secondary. At this period the extent of training needed\r\nmay be judged by the amount of stigmata, few though they be, present in\r\nthe child. With the period of the first dentition certain mental and\r\nnervous stigmata manifest themselves. If the child be liable to\r\nconvulsions on the slightest causes, if it manifest screaming fits without\r\napparent reason, if it be frequently assailed by night terrors, serious\r\nattention is needed, and this attention should be directed not only to its\r\nmental and nervous condition, but also to its functions of assimilation,\r\nelaboration, and excretion. Here dangerous degeneracy may show itself\r\nwhich is not apparent elsewhere. The training of the child should be\r\nconducted along the lines recommended during the first months of life. The\r\nessential principles governing this have been excellently outlined by\r\nJules Morel.[264] The treatment of all degenerates, and consequently their\r\npreservation from the evils that threaten them, ought to begin in their\r\nearliest infancy. First avoid exaggerating hereditary predisposition when\r\nserious neurosis has occurred in the parental line. Too often such a\r\nconclusion is adopted, and hope of recovery in the descendants is\r\nabandoned because one of the parents or the grandparents was affected with\r\ninsanity by reason of organic disease of the brain. Preliminary\r\nexamination of the neurotic needs to be made before one is enabled to\r\njudge as to the effects of heredity. Only after a careful examination can\r\nthe extent of heredity be determined. The proof will be beyond doubt when\r\nin parents and in their children stigmata of anatomic and physical\r\ndegeneration are abundantly found.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the question of the education of the child, the signs of\r\nfatigue expressed in the ears and face should receive attention. Attempts\r\nare being made in the schools of Chicago and elsewhere to determine these.\r\nThe following schedule prepared by Colin A. Scott for the Chicago Public\r\nSchools is an excellent means towards this end:--\r\n\r\n    _Eye_:--Each eye should be examined separately and in a good light.\r\n    Hold a card over one eye while the other is being examined. In using\r\n    the optometer, find the place where vision of the dots is the easiest\r\n    and most distinct. In using Snellen's test card, place the pupil at\r\n    the distance marked upon the card. Have him begin at the top and read\r\n    down as far as he can, first with one eye and then with the other. He\r\n    should be able to read a majority of the test type. Test with\r\n    optometer, and in reporting use the number on the stem preceded by F\r\n    for far-sightedness, and N for near-sightedness.\r\n\r\n    Place the card for astigmatism at the distance marked upon it. Cover\r\n    one eye and ask pupil to indicate, without moving nearer, the circles\r\n    which appear blacker or lighter than the others. Bring the card nearer\r\n    and find at how many feet distant he still sees any of the circles\r\n    darker or lighter than the others. At a sufficient distance every one\r\n    betrays some degree of astigmatism, which is of consequence as a\r\n    defect only when capable of detection within the distance indicated\r\n    upon the card. Outside of this point astigmatism may be reckoned as\r\n    absent and marked 0 in the report. Note if the pupil suffers\r\n    habitually from inflamed eyelids, and inquire if he complains of tired\r\n    and painful eyes or headaches after reading, studying, or using his\r\n    eyes in other similar ways. Note any other defect of formation or\r\n    position of either eye. Test the movement of the eyes by moving a coin\r\n    to about eighteen inches of the eyes.\r\n\r\n    Test each ear with the same watch in the same place and position.\r\n    Establish the normal degree of hearing for your room under these\r\n    conditions. Describe each ear in the report as--(1) normal; (2)\r\n    slightly hard of hearing; (3) hard of hearing; (4) considerably deaf;\r\n    or (5) deaf. As a further test, place the pupil at a distance and ask\r\n    him to repeat a number of words or letters. In all of these tests care\r\n    must be taken to avoid the possibility of suggestion in asking\r\n    questions or by other means. Note if the child is a mouth-breather, or\r\n    gives other signs of adenoids or enlarged tonsils. Notice circulation\r\n    in each ear.\r\n\r\n    _Signs of Fatigue, &c._:--In no case should it be said in the presence\r\n    of a young child that he is nervous or defective in development or\r\n    nutrition.\r\n\r\n    Note the position and balance of the body in standing and sitting, and\r\n    whether the movements are--(1) habitually restless and fidgety; (2)\r\n    note especially the balance of the head; and (3) position and\r\n    occupation of the hands, showing nervousness or not; (4) note any\r\n    twitching or marked lack of motor control in any part of the body; (5)\r\n    note whether the pupil flushes periodically or frequently; is the\r\n    pupil (6) easily excited or (7) fatigued by task in school or at home?\r\n    Inquire if the pupil has frequent \"morning tire\" (number of days per\r\n    month) or headaches not connected with serious defects of the eyes.\r\n    (8) Is he unduly irritable or irascible? Are there any other signs of\r\n    lack of emotional control--for example, (9) being too easily\r\n    impressed; or (10) with an undue tendency to tears, or uncontrollable\r\n    laughter?\r\n\r\n    Note the general condition of bodily nutrition (this by no means\r\n    depends directly upon food), and the number of signs of failure in\r\n    physical development (height, weight, &c.)\r\n\r\nResearches along this line in Germany and England have shown that the\r\nfatigue produced by studies varies, and that it is possible by arranging\r\nsequence of studies to remove fatigue produced by one study through the\r\nrest furnished by another. It has been found that biology exhausts least\r\nand mathematics and grammar most. While there is undoubtedly a spirit of\r\nemulation stirred by these last two studies which is injurious, the\r\nlimited associations affected by them are further a source of fatigue as\r\nwell. The numerous associations of biology afford points of rest on the\r\none hand while not tending to emulation on the other. It is this spirit of\r\nemulation, with its attendant alternation of worry and hope, that causes\r\nso many of the acquired nervous disorders of the adult, and which hence is\r\nobviously much more potent for evil in the child.\r\n\r\nPhysical and mental training in the special asylums for imbeciles and\r\nidiots gives such splendid results that it is surprising that parents, and\r\nespecially those charged with bad heredity, are not encouraged and advised\r\nby their physicians and friends to try from the first year of the child's\r\nlife special measures for their preservation. If a persevering physical\r\nand psychic management of the weak-minded gives such admirable results in\r\nasylums, it would be still better if the child could be trained from the\r\nearliest period of its life. This subject is ignored by the public, and in\r\nevery case not sufficiently appreciated. First of all try to preserve\r\npatients of a nervous or of a weak constitution. They should know in what\r\nstate of health they are living, they must be informed of the great danger\r\nof matrimonial union with a person of the same tendencies, and especially\r\nwhen consanguinity exists between them. The greatest care is to be given\r\nto children of this class. Experience has already led to the conclusion\r\nthat mental and physical overwork increases this defect: hence young\r\nbrains must not be over-excited with worry or emotionalism. The will of\r\nchildren ought to be cultivated and strengthened. Their minds should be\r\nmethodically educated. The bodily functions should never be artificially\r\nstimulated in any way, to increase unduly the assimilation of the food.\r\nDevelopment of the intelligence, the sensibility and the physical\r\ntraining, should be looked after in the same way. Once a plan of living is\r\nlaid down it should be followed. Success depends on this. The great\r\ninfluence of hygienic conditions (air, light, food, dress, habitation,\r\nsleep, muscular exercise, &c.) should not be forgotten, for without them\r\nefforts made for mental training are useless. By putting these methods\r\ninto execution an increase of the congenital taint is prevented, and such\r\nmethods perceptibly amend the psychopathic depreciation which in the usual\r\nway of living would certainly become worse. The object very often thus\r\nsecured is double; aggravation has been prevented, amelioration has been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with nervous exhaustion produced by the infectious diseases,\r\nthe dangers of the convalescent period are not sufficiently taken into\r\naccount. Parents are but too apt from mistaken motives of economy to\r\ndismiss the physician at the onset of convalescence. It is precisely at\r\nthis period that the system hovers between permanent systemic defect and\r\nrecovery. Proper diet and proper training at this time will often prevent\r\nthe checking of puberty development, and hence a breakdown under the\r\nstress of that period. The same is true of the convalescent period from\r\nsuch diseases in adults. Many a mother has thus injured her constitution\r\nand given birth to degenerate children in marked contrast with the\r\nnormality of the children born before.\r\n\r\nFrequently efforts are unsuccessful either because the family physician\r\nand the educator have no time to superintend treatment, or because they\r\nare unable, for many reasons, to individualise treatment properly. Hence\r\nthe high value of well-organised special boarding schools for the\r\ndegenerate.\r\n\r\nThe special aim, says Koch, is to teach the patient to govern himself, to\r\nrepose confidence in himself. To reach this end a great deal is required\r\nof him who undertakes the treatment. He has to exercise himself with\r\npatience. He must know how to divide the time for work and the time for\r\nrest. For many of these ill-balanced subjects variety is wanted as well in\r\nphysical work as mental training.\r\n\r\nThose charged with these remedies, exercising good judgment, are soon able\r\nto distinguish the more favourable cases from the more difficult. They can\r\nsoon say that a favourable remedy for the one may be noxious for another,\r\nand _vice versa_. Tonics, spirits, cold baths, &c., and even hypnotism may\r\nbe tried, but great caution is to be exercised, and these remedies should\r\nnever be employed except by prescription of physicians.\r\n\r\nEven subjects of congenital mental instability suffering from obsession\r\n(imperative ideas) without delusions are not inaccessible to treatment. In\r\nthese cases naturally the most important part belongs to the medical\r\ntreatment as in most mental cases. The more serious cases, dating from the\r\nfirst youth and aggravated in proportion to the age, are not to be\r\ncompletely cured. The progressive evolution can be stopped and patients\r\nameliorated in such a way that improvement makes their life bearable.\r\n\r\nThe same results can be obtained with less degenerate subjects. Success\r\noccurs often when patients are enabled to understand the nature of their\r\nsufferings, to discern that their disease does not belong to insanity,\r\nthat it is unlikely to lead to mental disease. This understanding is one\r\nof the best of all anodynes. Donders, of Utrecht, said to one of his\r\npatients suffering from optic hyperaesthesia of neurasthenic origin: \"What\r\nmedicine cannot do, time and oftentime hygiene realise.\" The intelligent\r\npatient having thus received assurance of his sight, good hygiene and\r\nmental rest soon after produced a cure. Acquired mental depreciation may\r\nexist from the first years of the child's life. These depreciations in\r\nproportion to their intensity are characterised by fatigue and even\r\nnervous exhaustion accompanied with physical weakness and functional\r\ntrouble in one or more organs of sense, by pathological debility of the\r\nintelligence and impaired memory especially for recent facts, difficulty\r\nof comprehension and of associating ideas and judgment, as well as\r\nworries, fears, despairs, especially in cases of intoxications by\r\nmorphine, cocaine, bromides, coffee, &c. These are increased by\r\nirritability and excitability when the troubles arise from onanism,\r\npuberty, or other periods of transformation in the sexual life.\r\n\r\nFight from the first the symptoms of predisposing and occasional causes,\r\nbecause if aggravation be prevented recovery is possible. Especially in\r\nthese depreciations must the physician utilise all his knowledge and prove\r\nthat only mental science is sufficient to cure such patients. Not only has\r\nhe to guide the intellectual life, and life of sensibility and will, but\r\nhe has also to remedy the morbid physical conditions, to superintend the\r\ngeneral regime, times of work and rest, air, light, dressing, preservation\r\nfrom alcoholic and other excesses.\r\n\r\nOne great element of possible danger of the first importance is training\r\nin the sexual sphere. To avoid and at the same time to enlighten is the\r\nproblem presented. In dealing with this problem the great requirement,\r\nbalance, not repression, must be kept in mind. Masturbation is very\r\nfrequently an expression not of mental or moral deficiency, but of purely\r\nlocal (first in at least most cases) physical conditions. Irritation (from\r\nthe presence of worms in the rectum or vagina, an intensely acid state of\r\nthe urine, or constipation) to male foreskin and female clitoris has\r\nproduced a local itching, the attempt to relieve which has led to\r\nmasturbation. Granting all that has been said about the deteriorating\r\neffects, especially in degenerates, the source should first be sought\r\nhere. Attention to these physical states will often prevent the\r\ndevelopment of this practice and its resultant moral deterioration.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the sexual appetite the fact should be remembered that\r\nencouragement of healthy modesty is a duty in both sexes, and\r\npre-eminently so in the male. Too much of what is called \"sexual purity\"\r\nis very often an expression of sexual perversity. While great stress has\r\nbeen laid on the evil effects of association between boys, too little\r\nstress has been laid on the danger of the training of boys by women. The\r\nsexual history of boys often demonstrates that their initiation into the\r\nsexual life was first at the instance of women older than themselves,\r\noften servants, but not rarely sexual \"purists\" or persons whose\r\nostentatious religiosity covered a sexual perversity. In the healthy\r\nassociation of the sexes there is very little danger, but in such morbid\r\nassociation there is great danger, the more that the morbid conceals\r\nitself under religiosity and the allied phases of sexual perversion. Great\r\nstress has been laid on the dangers of co-education, but the growing\r\nopinion is that education limited to one sex is the source of even greater\r\ndangers to both boy and girl. It is a matter of common observation among\r\ngenito-urinary specialists, alienists and gynecologists, that much of the\r\nalleged \"purity\" so ostentatiously displayed by graduates of colleges\r\nlimited to one sex, is often the offspring of a sexual perversion which,\r\nwhether congenital or not, has been fostered by the environment of one sex\r\nwithout the modifying, healthy influence of the other.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with these cases the stigmata first likely to attract the\r\nphysician's attention are in the milder cases those of the jaws, teeth,\r\nnose, throat, ear, and eye. Rapid decay of the teeth often leads to the\r\ndiscovery not merely of constitutional degeneracy, but also of the effects\r\nof certain strains which aggravated this. Dentists, mouth, throat, ear,\r\nand to a lesser degree eye specialists, are hence in a position to detect\r\ndegeneracy at its outset. If they do not put the cart before the horse,\r\nand refer the constitutional symptoms to the local disturbances, they are\r\nin a position to be of eminent service to the race.\r\n\r\nWhat Jules Morel has said of the more evident degenerates is equally true\r\nof the others. Education should be conducted along the lines which Froebel\r\nindicated when he pointed out that play is the child's work, and that a\r\ndevelopment of this work is the natural problem for education. Extension\r\nof the general training of the whole body, from the properly conducted\r\nkindergarten to the school, is the principle on which all education should\r\nbe conducted. This is recognised by advanced educators, as previously it\r\nhad been recognised by the physician confronted with the effects of school\r\nstrain resulting from the opposite theory. Manual training is a principle\r\nlong adopted by idiot schools, where training of certain muscles through\r\nboth mental and physical methods precedes intellectual training alone.\r\nManual training may, however, be the source of equal dangers with the\r\nexcessive abuse of intellectual training which preceded it. In the\r\neducation of the degenerate, as in the education of the other members of\r\nthe race, the true source of success is to avoid \"the falsehood of\r\nextremes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF AUTHORS\r\n\r\n\r\n  Agassiz, 43\r\n\r\n  Aitken, Sir W., 86\r\n\r\n  Alexander, Harriet C.

The size has been\r\naltered, the page having been made a little longer and narrower (9 x 6-1/2\r\ninches), thus allowing space for a larger number of autographs. The\r\nsetting-up of the pages has also been improved, and a large number of\r\nnames of composers, instrumentalists and singers, has been added to those\r\nwhich appeared in the previous edition. A special feature of the book\r\nconsists in the reproduction in fac-simile of autographs, and autographic\r\nmusic, of living composers; among the many new autographs which have been\r\nadded to the present edition being those of MM. Paderewski (to whom the\r\nbook is dedicated), Mascagni, Eugen d'Albert, Sarasate, Hamish McCunn, and\r\nC. Hubert Parry. Merely as a volume of poetry about music, this book makes\r\na charming anthology, the selections of verse extending from a period\r\nanterior to Chaucer to the present day.\r\n\r\n_Among the additional writers represented in the new edition are Alfred\r\nAustin, Arthur Christopher Benson, John Davidson, Norman Gale, Richard Le\r\nGallienne, Nora Hopper, Jean Ingelow, George Meredith, Alice Meynell,\r\nCoventry Patmore, Mary Robinson, Francis Thompson, Dr. Todhunter,\r\nKatharine Tynan, William Watson, and W. B. Yeats. The new edition is\r\nillustrated with portraits of Handel, Beethoven, Bach, Gluck, Chopin,\r\nWagner, Liszt, Rubinstein, and others. The compiler has taken the greatest\r\npains to make the new edition of the work as complete as possible; and a\r\nnew binding has been specially designed by an eminent artist._\r\n\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo, about 350 pp. each, Cloth Cover, 2/6 per Vol.; Half-Polished\r\nMorocco, Gilt Top, 5s.\r\n\r\nCount Tolstoy's Works.\r\n\r\nThe following Volumes are already issued--\r\n\r\n  A RUSSIAN PROPRIETOR.\r\n  THE COSSACKS.\r\n  IVAN ILYITCH, AND OTHER STORIES.\r\n  MY RELIGION.\r\n  LIFE.\r\n  MY CONFESSION.\r\n  CHILDHOOD, BOYHOOD, YOUTH.\r\n  THE PHYSIOLOGY OF WAR.\r\n  ANNA KARENINA. 3/6.\r\n  WHAT TO DO?\r\n  WAR AND PEACE.

Printed in very clear type._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is not only one of the finest, but probably one of the longest novels\r\never written, occupying, as it does in this edition, 1600 large and\r\nclosely printed pages. Notwithstanding its vast length, its multitude of\r\nfigures, the number of events it deals with, the interest of _War and\r\nPeace_ is not only intense, but unbroken throughout the immense march of\r\nthe story, so that no reader, great though the undertaking is, will fail\r\nto read to the end once he has started on the book. The eminent French\r\ncritic, Vicomte E. M. de Voguee, writing on _War and Peace_, says:\r\n\r\n    \"As you advance in the book, curiosity changes into astonishment, and\r\n    astonishment into admiration, before this impassive judge, who calls\r\n    before his tribunal all human actions, and makes the soul render to\r\n    itself an account of all its secrets. You feel yourself swept away on\r\n    the current of a tranquil river, the depth of which you cannot fathom;\r\n    it is life itself which is passing, agitating the hearts of men, which\r\n    are suddenly made bare in the truth and complexity of their\r\n    movements.\"\r\n\r\nAt the end of the second volume, a complete Synopsis of the story is\r\ngiven, also a list of the principal characters (of which there are about\r\none hundred).\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMEMORATION VOLUME.\r\n\r\nCrown 8vo, Cloth Elegant (the Cover specially designed), price 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\nWith 35 Full-page Illustrations.\r\n\r\n_\"DIAMOND\" JUBILEE EDITION._\r\n\r\nOur Queen:\r\n\r\n_The Life and Times of Victoria, Queen of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\nEmpress of India, etc._\r\n\r\nBY THE AUTHORS OF \"GENERAL GORDON,\" \"GRACE DARLING,\" ETC.\r\n\r\nThis important work provides an exhaustive history of the life of the\r\nQueen, from her infancy to the present year in which she commemorates the\r\nsixtieth year of her reign. Any account of the life of the Queen would be\r\nimperfect that did not take into account the immense march of\r\nprogress--political, industrial, and scientific--and the many memorable\r\nevents which her reign has witnessed. In the course of its narrative this\r\nvolume deals with these events in an impartial and enlightened spirit; it\r\nprovides, in fact, a complete and authentic history of our own times in\r\ntheir religious, social, literary, artistic, and scientific aspects,\r\ntogether with biographical records of the many men and women of eminence\r\nof the Victorian era. Perhaps in no respect have such great strides been\r\nmade as in the extent of the territory over which our Queen rules. When\r\nshe ascended the throne, her sway extended over 1,387,000 square miles\r\n(including colonies and dependencies); now the empire has an area of\r\n11,130,000 square miles, it being thus eight times as large as at the\r\nbeginning of the reign. The vast interest of the subject of the work need\r\nnot be commented on, an interest which will be both intensified and\r\nuniversally felt during the present year, and which it is the object of\r\nthis attractively and earnestly written book to worthily and adequately\r\nsatisfy. The many portraits which it will contain will add effectively to\r\nthe value of the work.\r\n\r\n_An Edition of this Work on large paper (Demy 8vo) with Coloured\r\nIllustrations, price 5s., is also published._\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS OF FAIRY TALES.\r\n\r\n_Crown 8vo, Cloth Elegant, Price 3/6 per Vol._\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH FAIRY AND OTHER FOLK TALES.\r\n\r\nSelected and Edited, with an Introduction,\r\n\r\nBY EDWIN SIDNEY HARTLAND.\r\n\r\n_With Twelve Full-Page Illustrations by_ CHARLES E.
