This Foundation\r\nwas established June 15, 1916, by a gift made to Yale University by\r\nDr. George C. F. Williams, of Hartford, a member of the Class of\r\n1878, Yale School of Medicine, where three generations of his family\r\nstudied--his father, William Cook Williams, in the Class of 1850, and\r\nhis grandfather, William Chauncey Williams, in the Class of 1822.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nVery few persons will challenge the truth of the statement that in the\r\nUnited States and Canada there are not many physicians who possess\r\neven a slight knowledge concerning the manner in which the science\r\nof medicine has attained its present power as an agency for good, or\r\nconcerning the men who played the chief parts in bringing about this\r\ngreat result. Up to the present time no blame may justly be attached to\r\nany individuals or to any educational institutions for this prevailing\r\nlack of knowledge, and for two very good reasons, _viz._: first,\r\nin a newly settled country, in which the population grows by leaps and\r\nbounds through the influx of foreign immigrants, the training of young\r\nmen for the degree of M.D. must necessarily be almost entirely of a\r\npractical character, and consequently the teaching of such a subject\r\nas the history of medicine would be quite out of place; and, second,\r\nthe treatises on this subject which are purchasable by English-speaking\r\nphysicians are of rather too scientific a character to appeal either\r\nto the undergraduate or to the busy practitioner. The first of the\r\nreasons named, it may now safely be assumed, is rapidly losing its\r\nvalidity, if indeed it has not already ceased entirely to afford a\r\nlegitimate excuse for neglecting the study of this branch of medical\r\nscience. On the other hand, the second reason mentioned is still in\r\nforce,--so far at least as the present writer knows,--and, if such be\r\nthe case, it certainly cannot fail to act as a deterrent influence of\r\ngreat potency. Here, then, is my apology for attempting to prepare an\r\naccount of the history of medicine which shall present the essential\r\nfacts truthfully and with a sufficient degree of attractiveness to\r\nwin the continuing interest of the reader; which shall place before\r\nhim, and especially before those who are just at the threshold of\r\ntheir professional career, word pictures of those physicians of past\r\nages whose lives may safely be taken as models worthy to be copied;\r\nand which shall describe, so far as I am able to do this, the methods\r\nwhich they employed to advance the science of medicine, to gain genuine\r\nprofessional success, and to merit the enduring esteem of later\r\ngenerations of physicians. If my efforts prove successful in producing\r\nthis kind of history it is fair to expect that, in a comparatively\r\nshort time, those physicians whose interest may have been aroused by\r\nthe perusal of this less complete and more popular work, will demand\r\nsomething of a more exhaustive character--a book, for example, like the\r\nadmirable history which Max Neuburger, of Vienna, is now publishing,\r\nand of which two volumes have already issued from the press (the\r\nfirst in 1906 and the second in 1911).[1] It is to this work and the\r\nexcellent history written by the late Dr. Haeser, of Breslau, that I\r\nam chiefly indebted for the information supplied in these pages; and\r\nI therefore desire to make special mention here of this indebtedness.\r\nThe other sources from which I have been an occasional borrower are\r\nall mentioned in the “List of Authorities Consulted.” Footnotes and\r\ncross-references in the text interfere greatly with one’s pleasure in\r\nreading a book, and I have therefore not hesitated to introduce them\r\nsparingly.\r\n\r\nIt gives me a special pleasure to call attention here to the\r\nfar-sighted generosity displayed by the founder of The Williams\r\nMemorial Fund in making it practicable henceforth for the Yale\r\nUniversity Press to accept for publication medical treatises which\r\ndeal with the historical and scientific questions of this branch of\r\nknowledge, but which for sound business reasons cannot be published on\r\na merely commercial basis.\r\n\r\nAnd I have the further pleasure of expressing my real appreciation\r\nof the skill with which the University Press has solved the problems\r\nof a suitable size and style of type for this volume, and of the\r\nsound advice which it has given with regard to the extent to which\r\nthe effectiveness of the book may be increased by the introduction of\r\npictorial illustrations.\r\n\r\nTo my friend, Lawrence F. Abbott, of New York, I am deeply indebted for\r\nthe valuable assistance which he has rendered me throughout the entire\r\nprogress of this work. Indeed, without this assistance, I doubt whether\r\nI should have had the courage to remain at my post to the very end.\r\n\r\n                                                    ALBERT H.

It is a\r\nrecord, therefore, in which every practitioner of medicine should\r\ntake a deep interest. Rokitansky, the famous pathologist of Vienna,\r\nexpressed the same idea very tersely when he said: “Those about to\r\nstudy medicine and the younger physicians should light their torches at\r\nthe fires of the ancients.” Members of the medical profession, however,\r\nare not the only persons in the community who take an interest in the\r\norigin and growth of the science of medicine and the art of healing\r\nthe diseased or damaged body; the educated layman is but little less\r\ninterested than the physician, being ever ready to learn all he can\r\nabout the progress of a branch of knowledge which so profoundly affects\r\nhis welfare. But hitherto the only sources of information available for\r\nthose who are not familiar with French or German have been treatises\r\nof so technical a character that even physicians have shown relatively\r\nlittle disposition to read them.\r\n\r\nThe science of medicine developed slowly from very humble beginnings,\r\nand for this earliest period the historian has no records of any kind\r\nwhich may be utilized for his guidance. It is reasonably certain,\r\nfurthermore, that this prehistoric period lasted for a very long time,\r\nprobably several thousand years; and when, finally, some light on the\r\nsubject appeared, it was found to emanate from several widely separated\r\nregions--_e.g._, from India, Mesopotamia, Egypt and Greece. Then,\r\nafter the lapse of additional hundreds or even thousands of years,\r\nthere was inaugurated the practice of making written records of all\r\nimportant events, and, among others, of the different diseases which\r\naffect mankind, of the means employed for curing them or for relieving\r\nthe effects which they produce, and of the men who distinguished\r\nthemselves in the practice of this art. While the “science of the\r\nspade” and that of deciphering the writing of the papyri, monuments\r\nand tablets thus brought to light, have already during the last half\r\ncentury greatly altered our ideas with regard to ancient medicine,\r\nthere are good reasons for believing that much additional information\r\nupon this subject may be looked for in the not distant future. It is\r\nplain, therefore, that a history of the primitive period of medicine,\r\nif written to-day, may have to be modified to-morrow in some important\r\nrespects. On the other hand, the facts relating to the later periods\r\nare now so well established that a fair-minded writer should experience\r\nno serious difficulty in judging correctly with regard to their value\r\nand with regard to the claims of the different men to be honored for\r\nthe part which each has played in bringing the science and art of\r\nmedicine to their present high state of completeness and efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe subdivision of the history of medicine into separate periods\r\nis certainly desirable, provided it be found practicable to assign\r\nreasonably well-defined limits to the periods chosen. But, when the\r\nattempt is made to establish such subdivisions, one soon discovers that\r\nthe boundaries pass so gradually the one into the other at certain\r\npoints, or else overlap so conspicuously at other points, that one\r\nhesitates to adopt any fixed plan of classification. Of the four\r\nschemes which I have examined--viz., those of Daremberg, of Aschoff,\r\nof Neuburger, and of Pagel--that of Neuburger seems to me to be the\r\nbest. That which has been adopted, however, in the preparation of the\r\npresent outline sketch combines some of the features of both the Pagel\r\nand the Neuburger schemes.\r\n\r\n_Periods in the History of Medicine._--There are nine more or less\r\ndistinctly defined periods in the history of medicine, to wit:--\r\n\r\nFIRST EPOCH: _Primitive medicine_.--This period extends through\r\nprehistoric ages to a date which differs for different parts of the\r\nworld. The duration of this period, in any case, is to be reckoned by\r\nthousands of years.\r\n\r\nSECOND EPOCH: _The medicine of the East_--that is, of the cultivated\r\noriental races of whose history we possess only a very fragmentary\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nTHIRD EPOCH: _The medicine of the classical period of antiquity_--the\r\npre-Hippocratic period of Greek medicine.\r\n\r\nFOURTH EPOCH: _The medicine of the Hippocratic writings_--the most\r\nflourishing period of Greek medicine.\r\n\r\nFIFTH EPOCH: _The medicine of the period during which the centre of\r\ngreatest intellectual activity was located at Alexandria, Egypt_.\r\n\r\nSIXTH EPOCH: _The medicine of Galen_--an author whose teachings exerted\r\na preponderating influence upon the thought and practice of physicians\r\nin every part of the civilized world up to the seventeenth century of\r\nthe Christian era. This period is also characterized by the gradual\r\ndiminution of the influence of Greek medicine.\r\n\r\nSEVENTH EPOCH: _The medicine of the Middle Ages_--a period which\r\nincludes a large part of the preceding epoch. Its most characteristic\r\nfeature is the important part played by the Arabs in moulding the\r\nteachings and practice of the medical men of that time (ninth to\r\nfifteenth century).\r\n\r\nEIGHTH EPOCH (fifteenth and sixteenth centuries): _The medicine of the\r\nRenaissance period_--characterized chiefly by the adoption of the only\r\neffective method of studying the anatomy of man--the actual dissection\r\nof human bodies.\r\n\r\nNINTH EPOCH (from the beginning of the seventeenth century to the\r\npresent time): _Modern medicine_.--This epoch may with advantage be\r\ndivided into two periods--the first extending to about the year 1775,\r\nsoon after which time Jenner began his important work on the subject\r\nof vaccination; and the second to the present time. No attempt will be\r\nmade in the following account to cover this second period.\r\n\r\n_The Beginnings of Medicine._--In the early period of man’s existence\r\nupon this earth he must have possessed an exceedingly small stock of\r\nknowledge with regard to the maintenance of his body in health and with\r\nregard to the means which he should adopt in order to restore it to a\r\nnormal condition after it had been injured by violence or impaired in\r\nits working machinery by disease. With the progress of time, utilizing\r\nhis powers of observation and his reasoning faculty, he slowly made\r\nadditions to his stock of facts of this nature. Thus, for example, he\r\ngradually learned that cold, under certain circumstances, is competent\r\nto produce pain in the chest, shortness of breath, active secretion of\r\nmucus, etc., and his instinct led him, when he became affected in this\r\nmanner, to crave the local application of heat as a means of affording\r\nrelief from these distressing symptoms. Again, when he used certain\r\nplants as food he could scarcely fail to note the facts that some of\r\nthem produced a refreshing or cooling effect, that others induced a\r\nsensation of warmth, and finally that others still, by reason of their\r\npoisonous properties, did actual harm. Sooner or later, such phenomena\r\nas nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea would also be attributed by him to\r\ntheir true causes. In due course of time his friends and neighbors,\r\nhaving made similar observations and having tried various remedial\r\nprocedures for the relief of their bodily ills, would come together and\r\ncompare with him their several experiences; and so eventually the fact\r\nwould be brought out that the particular method adopted by one of their\r\nnumber for the relief of certain symptoms had proved more effective\r\nthan any of the others. Thus gradually this isolated community or tribe\r\nof men must have learned how to treat, more or less successfully, the\r\nsimpler ills to which they were liable.\r\n\r\nLucien Le Clerc quotes from the Arab historian Ebn Abi Ossaïbiah the\r\nfollowing account of the manner in which bloodletting probably first\r\ncame to be adopted as a remedial measure:--\r\n\r\n   Let us suppose that in the earliest period of man’s history\r\n   somebody experienced the need of the medical art. He may, for\r\n   example, have felt a general sense of heaviness in his body\r\n   (plethora), associated perhaps with redness of the eyes, and\r\n   he probably did not know what he should do in order to obtain\r\n   relief from these sensations. Then, when his trouble was at its\r\n   worst, his nose began to bleed, and the bleeding continued until\r\n   he experienced decided relief from his discomfort. In this way\r\n   he learned an important fact, and cherished it in his memory.\r\n\r\n   On a later occasion he experienced once more the same sense of\r\n   heaviness, and he lost no time in scratching the interior of his\r\n   nose in order to provoke a return of the bleeding. The nosebleed\r\n   thus excited again gave him entire relief from the unpleasant\r\n   sensations, and upon the first convenient occasion he told his\r\n   children and all his relatives about the successful results\r\n   obtained from this curative procedure. Little by little this\r\n   simple act, which was a first step in the healing art, developed\r\n   into the intelligently and skilfully performed operation of\r\n   venesection.\r\n\r\nPrimitive man also increased his stock of knowledge in the healing art\r\nby reading attentively the book of nature,--_i.e._, by observing\r\nhow animals, when ill, eat the leaves or stems of certain plants and\r\nthus obtain relief from their disorders. The virtues of a species of\r\noriganum, as an antidote for poisoning from the bite of a snake, were\r\nrevealed, it is asserted, by the observation that turtles, when bitten\r\nby one of these reptiles, immediately seek for the plant in question\r\nand, after feeding upon it, experience no perceptible ill effects from\r\nthe poisonous bite. The natives of India ascribe the discovery of the\r\nremarkable virtues of snakeroot (the bitter root of the ophiorrhiza\r\nMungos) as an antidote for poisoning by the bite of a snake, to the\r\nichneumon, a small animal of the rat species. The instinctive desire\r\nto escape pain taught man, as it does the lower animals, to keep a\r\nfractured limb at rest, thus giving the separated ends of the bone\r\nan opportunity to reunite; after which the limb eventually becomes\r\nas strong as it ever was. Simple as this mode of acquiring useful\r\nmedical knowledge may appear to us moderns, there are good reasons\r\nfor believing that hundreds of years must have elapsed before the\r\naccumulated stock of such experiences became really considerable.\r\nOn the other hand, it is reasonable to suppose that this growth in\r\nmedical knowledge took place more rapidly in certain tribes or races\r\nthan in others, and that when, under the action of wars, the inferior\r\nmen became tributary to those of greater intellectual powers, they\r\nacquired, through contact with their conquerors, additional knowledge\r\nat a much more rapid rate. One great hindrance, however, stood in the\r\nway of such progress. I refer to the deeply rooted belief, entertained\r\nby man in this primitive period of his existence, in the agency of\r\nmalevolent spirits (demons) in the production of disease,--a belief\r\nwhich continued to exist for many thousands of years. Out of such a\r\nbelief developed the necessity of discovering some practical method\r\nof appeasing the evil spirits and of thus obtaining the desired cure\r\nof the ills of the body. Usually some member of the tribe who had\r\ndisplayed special skill in the treatment of disease, and who at the\r\nsame time was liberally endowed with the qualities which characterize\r\nthe charlatan, was chosen to be the priest or “medicine man.” It was\r\nhis duty to employ measures suitable for expelling the demon from the\r\npatient’s body and for restoring the latter to health. Possessing\r\ngreat influence, as these superstitious people believed he did, with\r\nthe unseen gods, such a physician-priest must have discouraged all\r\nefforts to increase the stock of genuine medical knowledge; for such\r\nan increase would necessarily mean a diminution of his own power and\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nIn what must still be termed the age of primitive medicine, but\r\nundoubtedly at an advanced stage of that epoch, there were performed\r\nsurgical operations which imply a remarkable advance in the invention\r\nof cutting instruments and in the knowledge of the location and nature\r\nof certain comparatively rare diseases, and at the same time great\r\ncourage and wonderful enterprise on the part of those early physicians.\r\nAs evidence of the correctness of these statements the fact may be\r\nmentioned that trepanned skulls belonging to the neolithic period have\r\nbeen dug up in various parts of the world--in most of the countries\r\nof Europe, in Algiers, in the Canary Islands, and in both North and\r\nSouth America. From a careful study of these skulls it has been learned\r\nthat the individuals upon whom such severe surgical work had been\r\ndone--sometimes as often as three separate times--recovered from the\r\noperation. The instruments used were made of sharpened flint (saws or\r\nchisels). Pain in the head, spasms or convulsions, and mental disorders\r\nare suggested by Neuburger as the indications which probably led to\r\nthe performance of the trepanning. This author also makes the further\r\nstatement that the ancient Egyptians employed knives made of flint for\r\nopening the dead bodies which they were about to embalm and for the\r\noperation of circumcision. Recent excavations have thrown additional\r\nlight upon the state of medical knowledge during this neolithic\r\nage. Thus, there have been found specimens of anchylosed joints, of\r\nfractured bones, of flint arrow heads lodged in different parts of\r\nthe skeleton, of rhachitis, of caries and necrosis of bone, etc. The\r\nfollowing quotation is taken from the printed report of a lecture\r\nrecently delivered in London by Dr. F. M. Sandwith, Consulting Surgeon\r\nto the Khedive of Egypt. Speaking of certain excavations made in the\r\nNubian Desert and of the oldest surgical implements yet discovered, he\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n   In one place a graveyard was found, and here were remains of\r\n   bodies with fractured limbs that had been set with bark splints.\r\n   One was a right thigh bone that had been broken, and was still\r\n   held in position by a workmanlike splint and bandages. All the\r\n   knots were true reef-knots, and the wrappings showed how the\r\n   strips of palm-fibre cloth were set just as a good surgeon would\r\n   set them in these days so as to use the full strength of the\r\n   fabric.\r\n\r\nAmong the most ancient remedies may be mentioned talismans, amulets\r\nand medicine stones, which were furnished--presumably at a price--by\r\nthe physician-priests, and which were believed to afford the wearers\r\nprotection against evil spirits (the “evil eye,” for example). Various\r\nobjects were used for this purpose, and among them the following\r\ndeserve to be mentioned: disks of bone removed with the aid of a\r\ntrephine from the skull of a dead human body and worn with a string\r\naround the neck; the teeth of different animals; bones of the weasel;\r\ncats’ claws; the lower jaw of a squirrel; the trachea of some bird; one\r\nof the vertebrae of an adder, etc. And where these measures failed,\r\nthe priests resorted to incantations, religious dances, and the\r\nbeating of drums or the rattling of dried gourds filled with pebbles.\r\nPrimitive races of men inhabiting the most widely separated parts of\r\nthe earth appear to have adopted means almost identical with those\r\njust described for driving away evil spirits. The holding of these\r\nsuperstitious beliefs is one of the most extraordinary characteristics\r\nof the human race. It played an important part throughout the classical\r\nperiod of Greek and Roman civilization, and also during the Middle\r\nAges. Christianity undoubtedly was a most potent agency in hastening\r\nthe eradication of the feeling, but even this great power has not yet\r\nsufficed entirely to do away with superstition; for traces of this\r\nweakness may still easily be detected in some of the men and women with\r\nwhom we daily come in contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                           ORIENTAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe researches of the scholar working in combination with the engineer\r\nhave unearthed--more particularly in Mesopotamia, in Egypt and in\r\nGreece--evidences of an ancient medical science far advanced beyond\r\nthat briefly described in the preceding chapter. These evidences relate\r\nto nations that flourished as far back as four thousand years B. C.\r\nWhile they are very fragmentary and cover historical events which\r\nare often separated from one another by long periods of time, these\r\ndata nevertheless suffice to give one a fairly good idea of the then\r\nprevailing state of medical knowledge. Both Pagel and Neuburger adopt\r\nthe plan of discussing these different nationalities separately, and I\r\nshall follow their example.\r\n\r\n_Medicine in Mesopotamia._--As appears from the most recent\r\ninvestigations the Sumerians were the first occupants of the region\r\nlying between the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers. It was from them\r\nthat their Semitic conquerors, the Babylonians and the Assyrians,\r\nreceived a civilization which, already about 4000 B. C., had\r\nreached a wonderful degree of development. The canalization of the\r\nlow-lying lands of that region, the organization of a religious and\r\ncivil government of a most efficient type, the invention first of\r\npicture-writing and then of the cuneiform characters, the cultivation\r\nof the arts and natural sciences and especially of astronomy and\r\nmathematics to a high degree of perfection,--these are among the things\r\nwhich were accomplished by this very clever race of men. In addition,\r\nhowever, to these useful activities the Babylonians developed and\r\ncultivated diligently the science of astrology--that is, the science\r\nof predicting human events (such as the death of the king, the\r\noccurrence of the plague or of war, etc.) from various telluric and\r\ncosmic phenomena--an eclipse of the sun, peculiarities of the weather,\r\nthe condition of vegetation, etc. The deeply rooted love of the human\r\nrace for the supernatural--a characteristic to which I have already\r\nbriefly referred--facilitated the development of this harmful practice,\r\nand kept it alive through many succeeding centuries. Walter Scott, in\r\nhis romance entitled Quentin Durward, gives an admirable portrait of\r\na typical astrologer whom Louis XI. of France maintained at his court\r\nduring a part of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nWhile in other parts of the Orient the science of medicine, as\r\nalready stated at the beginning of this chapter, made a noteworthy\r\nadvance beyond the conditions observed among the primitive races, in\r\nMesopotamia this science, which was far more important to the welfare\r\nof its inhabitants than all the other branches of knowledge combined,\r\nreceived very little attention and consequently made only insignificant\r\nadvances. The British Museum has in its possession several thousand\r\ntablets which were dug up from the ruins of Nineveh and which represent\r\na part of the library of the Assyrian King, Assurbanipal (668–626 B.\r\nC.). Translations of the text of only a very few of these tablets have\r\nthus far been published, and from these, which embody the greater\r\npart of our knowledge of Assyrian medicine, it appears that, for the\r\npresent at least, the estimate recorded above must stand. A few new\r\nfacts, however, have been brought to light, and they appear to be of\r\nsufficient importance to merit brief consideration here.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, Herodotus, who visited Babylon about 300 B. C., has\r\nthis to say in relation to the state of medicine in that city:--\r\n\r\n   The following custom seems to me the wisest of their\r\n   institutions next to the one lately praised. They have no\r\n   physicians, but, when a man is ill, they lay him in the public\r\n   square, and the passers-by come up to him, and if they have\r\n   ever had his disease themselves or have known any one who has\r\n   suffered from it, they give him advice, recommending him to do\r\n   whatever they found good in their own case, or in the case\r\n   known to them; and no one is allowed to pass the sick man in\r\n   silence without asking him what his ailment is.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians held some rather strange beliefs regarding the\r\nconstruction of the human body and the manner in which its functions\r\nare performed. The living being, as they maintained, is composed of\r\nsoul and body. The intellect has its seat in the heart, the liver\r\nserving as the central organ for the blood, which they considered to be\r\nthe true life principle. They divided this fluid into two kinds--blood\r\nof the daytime (bright arterial) and that of the night (dark venous).\r\nAlthough the blood was held by them to be the basis of life, they\r\nevidently attached a certain value to respiration, for one of their\r\nprayers begins with these words: “God, my creator, lead me by the\r\nhand; guide the breath of my mouth.” Disease was always looked upon as\r\nsomething (usually personified as a demon) that entered the body from\r\nwithout and that consequently had to be expelled. There were special\r\ndemons for the different diseases. Thus, Asakku brought fever to the\r\nhead, Namtar threatened life with the plague, and Utukku attacked the\r\nthroat, Alu the breast, Gallu the hand, Rabisu the skin, and so on. The\r\nmost dreaded demons were the spirits of the dead. Special amulets were\r\nemployed as protective remedies. Prayer formulae were also used. Here\r\nis one among several that I find mentioned in Neuburger’s treatise:--\r\n\r\n   Wicked Consumption, villainous Consumption, Consumption which\r\n   never leaves a man, Consumption which cannot be driven away,\r\n   Consumption which cannot be induced to leave, Bad Consumption,\r\n   in the name of Heaven be placated, in the name of Earth I\r\n   conjure thee!\r\n\r\nThe genuine remedial agents employed in Babylonia were of a most\r\nvaried nature: a mixture of honey and syrup of dates; medicinal herbs\r\nof different kinds for internal administration; bloodletting; the use\r\nof cups for drawing blood to the surface of the body; warm baths and\r\ncold shower baths; rubbing oil over the body; medicated clysters; the\r\nuse of various salves; the use of secret remedies which were composed\r\nof various ingredients and which bore such names as “the Sun God’s\r\nremedy,” “the dog’s tongue,” “the skin of the yellow snake,” “the\r\nmedicine brought from the mountain of the human race,” etc.\r\n\r\nSome of the predictions made by the Babylonian astrologers are of\r\nsufficient interest to be placed on record. Here are a few examples:--\r\n\r\n   If the west wind is blowing when the new moon is first seen,\r\n   there is likely to be an unusual amount of illness during that\r\n   month.\r\n\r\n   If Venus approaches the constellation of Cancer, there will be\r\n   respect for law and prosperity in the land; those who are ill\r\n   will recover, and pregnant women will have easy confinements.\r\n\r\n   If Mercury makes its appearance on the fifteenth day of the\r\n   month, there will be corpses in the land. And again, if the\r\n   constellation of Cancer is obscured, a destructive demon will\r\n   take possession of the land, and there will be corpses.\r\n\r\n   If Jupiter and the other planets stand opposite one another,\r\n   some calamity will overtake the land. If Mars and Jupiter come\r\n   into conjunction, there will be deaths among the cattle.\r\n\r\n   If an eclipse of the Sun take place on the twenty-eighth day\r\n   of the month Ijar, the king will have a long reign; but, if it\r\n   take place on the twenty-ninth day of the month, there will be\r\n   corpses on the first day of the following month.\r\n\r\n   If there should be thunder during the month of Tisri, a spirit\r\n   of enmity will prevail in the land; and if it should rain during\r\n   that month, both men and cattle will fall ill.\r\n\r\nBesides these predictions, which were based upon phenomena connected\r\nwith the movements of the stars and the conditions of the weather,\r\nthere were others which the people themselves were competent to make\r\nwithout the aid of the professional astrologer or the official priest.\r\nSuch, for example, are the following “omens”:--\r\n\r\n   If a woman gives birth to a child the right ear of which is\r\n   lacking, long will be the reign of the prince of that land.\r\n\r\n   If a woman gives birth to a child both of whose ears are\r\n   lacking, sadness will come upon the land and it will lose some\r\n   of its importance.\r\n\r\n   If a woman gives birth to a child whose face resembles the beak\r\n   of a bird, there will surely be peace in the land.\r\n\r\n   If a woman gives birth to a child the right hand of which lacks\r\n   fingers, the sovereign of that country will be taken prisoner by\r\n   his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe keen interest taken by the priests in the matter of predicting the\r\noutcome of various diseases led in due time to their making records\r\nof the nature, symptoms and progress of the latter. Although this\r\npractice was inaugurated purely for the purpose of enabling them to\r\nforetell with greater accuracy the probable issue of any given malady,\r\nit nevertheless served also to establish on a firm basis the custom\r\nof keeping records of the case-histories. Only one thing more was now\r\nneeded to render this practice the first step in a genuine advance of\r\nmedical knowledge; but this step could not be made in Babylonia, where\r\npriestcraft and superstition had struck such deep roots in the public\r\nlife. It was only in free Greece, and at a time in its history when\r\nthe spirit of Hippocrates exerted an overpowering influence over the\r\nminds of men, that the separation of the functions of the physician\r\nfrom those of the priest became possible and was in due time effected.\r\n(Neuburger.)\r\n\r\nBefore closing this very incomplete account of the state of medical\r\nknowledge in Babylonia, it will be well to mention some of the items of\r\nthe law laid down by Hammurabi (circa 2200 B. C.) for the guidance of\r\nthe physicians of that land with regard to the remuneration which they\r\nshould receive. At the same time I shall make no attempt to reconcile\r\nthe statement of Herodotus (given on page 12) with the wording of\r\nthis law, which distinctly recognizes the existence of physicians in\r\nMesopotamia. Possibly the conditions in Nineveh in the fourth century\r\nB. C. were different from what they had been eighteen centuries earlier.\r\n\r\n   If a physician makes a deep cut with an operating knife of\r\n   bronze and effects a cure, or if with such a knife he opens a\r\n   tumor and thus avoids damaging the patient’s eye, he shall\r\n   receive as his reward 10 shekels of silver. If the patient is\r\n   an emancipated slave, the fee shall be reduced to 5 shekels. In\r\n   the case of a slave the master to whom he belongs shall pay the\r\n   physician 2 shekels.\r\n\r\n   If a physician makes a deep wound with an operating knife of\r\n   bronze and the patient dies, or if he opens a tumor with such a\r\n   knife and the patient’s eye is thereby destroyed, the operator\r\n   shall be punished by having his hands cut off.\r\n\r\n   If a physician, in operating upon the slave of a freedman, makes\r\n   a deep wound with an operating knife of bronze and thus kills\r\n   the patient, he shall give the owner a slave in exchange for the\r\n   one killed. And if, in opening a tumor with such a knife, the\r\n   physician destroys the slave’s eye, he shall pay to the latter’s\r\n   owner one-half the slave’s value.\r\n\r\n   If a physician effects the healing of a broken bone or cures a\r\n   disease of the intestines, he shall receive from the patient a\r\n   fee of 5 shekels of silver.[3]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine anything better adapted to arrest the\r\ndevelopment of medical knowledge in a nation than the promulgation of a\r\nlaw like that ascribed to Hammurabi; and one cannot be surprised at the\r\nstatement made by Herodotus, eighteen centuries later, “that there were\r\nno physicians in Babylon.” Foolhardy, indeed, would be the man who, for\r\nthe sake of earning a possible reward of six shekels of silver, would\r\nbe willing to risk the danger of having both his hands cut off; and yet\r\nevery conscientious and faithful practitioner of medicine in Babylon at\r\nthe time mentioned must necessarily have been obliged to run this risk.\r\n\r\n_Medicine in Ancient Egypt._--Of the sources of information with\r\nregard to the knowledge of medicine possessed by the ancient Egyptians\r\nthe most important are the following: Homer’s Odyssey; Herodotus;\r\nDiodorus; Clemens of Alexandria; Pliny’s Natural History; Dioscorides;\r\nthe Papyrus Ebers; the Papyrus Brugsch; and the Papyrus Birch, in the\r\nBritish Museum. Then, in addition to these sources, there are the\r\ninscriptions found in recent times on the walls of the temples and\r\nthe pictures painted on the wrappings of mummies, from both of which\r\nconsiderable information with regard to various therapeutic procedures\r\nand to the details of the process of embalming has been derived. Some\r\nof this information extends back to about 3000 B. C. The healing art\r\nwas at that time entirely in the hands of the temple priests, who\r\nformed an organized body with a sort of physician-in-chief at its head.\r\nTwo of these--Athotis and Tosorthos--attained such a high standing and\r\npossessed such influence that they were chosen Kings of Egypt. The\r\npractice of obstetrics was entrusted to the care of women who had been\r\ntrained to this work and who acknowledged the authority of a skilled\r\nhead-nurse of their own sex. The patients who had received treatment\r\nfor their ailments at one or other of the temples presented to these\r\ninstitutions gifts in the form of sculptured or painted representations\r\nof the diseased or injured parts of the body. In these and in other\r\nways medicine and pharmacy received contributions which were of no mean\r\nvalue. Botanical gardens were established at various places in Egypt\r\nand were cultivated with care. Chemistry--a name which derives its\r\norigin from a word in the Egyptian language--also made considerable\r\nprogress as a science. On the other hand, the knowledge of the\r\nstructure and functions of the different parts of the human body was\r\nvery imperfect and remained unchanged for many centuries. This would\r\nprobably not have been the case if the work of preparing the bodies\r\nfor the process of embalming had not been entrusted entirely to mere\r\nmenials, men who had no interest in anything but the mechanical part of\r\ntheir occupation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the statement of Clemens of Alexandria[4] the Egyptian\r\nscience of medicine is set forth in the last six of the forty-two\r\nhermetic books, which were composed, according to the prevailing\r\nbelief, by the god Thot or Thoüt (= Hermes of the Greeks). The first\r\none of these six books is devoted to the anatomy of the human body,\r\nthe second one to the diseases to which it is liable, the third to\r\nsurgery, the fourth to remedial agents, the fifth to the diseases of\r\nthe eye, and the sixth to diseases of women. As to the remedial agents,\r\nNeuburger says that it has not been found practicable to identify more\r\nthan a very few of the Egyptian drugs enumerated by Dioscorides. Homer,\r\nwho wrote at least five hundred years B. C., has something to say on\r\nthis subject in the Odyssey.[5] His words are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Such drugs Jove’s daughter owned, with skill prepar’d,\r\n    And of prime virtue, by the wife of Thone,\r\n    Aegyptian Polydamna, given her.\r\n    For Aegypt teems with drugs, yielding no few\r\n    Which, mingled with the drink, are good, and many\r\n    Of baneful juice, and enemies to life.\r\n    There every man in skill medicinal\r\n    Excels; for they are sons of Pason[6] all.\r\n\r\nA physician of the present age, on reading the histories of the\r\nancient Egyptians, Greeks and other oriental nations, finds it almost\r\nimpossible to realize that many of the characters designated as gods\r\nand goddesses, possibly all of them, were not mythological persons, as\r\nthey would have been termed only a few years ago, but real human beings\r\nlike ourselves. Such, for example, was the opinion of Cicero who, when\r\nasked why these people were spoken of as gods, gave the following\r\nreply:[7] “It was a well-established custom among the ancients to deify\r\nthose who had rendered to their fellow men important services, as\r\nHercules, Castor and Pollux, Aesculapius, Bacchus and many others had\r\ndone.” And I find that those modern authors of the history of medicine\r\nwhose works I have consulted, are quite ready to accept even the gods\r\ncalled by the Egyptians Osiris (or Serapis), Isis, and Thoüt (or\r\nHermes) as genuine historical personages. Such a belief receives some\r\ndegree of confirmation from the following inscriptions which, according\r\nto the authority of Le Clerc,[8] were found engraved upon two columns\r\ndiscovered in the city of Nyoa, in Arabia:--\r\n\r\n   (On the first column): My father is Cronos, the youngest of\r\n   all the gods. I am King Osiris, who have visited with my\r\n   armies every country on the face of the earth--the remotest\r\n   inhabitable parts of India, the regions lying beneath the Bear,\r\n   the neighborhood of the sources of the Danube, and the shores\r\n   of the Ocean. I am the oldest son of Cronos, the scion of a\r\n   fine and noble race. I am related to the day. There is no part\r\n   of the earth which I have not visited, and I have filled the\r\n   entire universe with my benefits. (On the second column): I\r\n   am Isis, Queen of all this country, and I have been taught by\r\n   Thoüt. There is nobody who has the power to loosen what I shall\r\n   bind. I am the oldest daughter of Cronos, the youngest of the\r\n   gods. I am the wife and at the same time the sister of King\r\n   Osiris. To me is due the credit of having been the first to\r\n   teach men agriculture. I am the mother of King Horus. I shine in\r\n   the dog-star. It is I who built the city of Bubastis. Farewell,\r\n   Egypt, my native land.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the art of medicine, says Le Clerc, was attributed to\r\nOsiris and Isis, and they were also credited with having taught it to\r\nAesculapius.\r\n\r\nAt the cities of On (Heliopolis), Sais, Memphis and Thebes were located\r\nthe most celebrated of the Egyptian temples, which were dedicated\r\nnot merely to the worship of their numerous gods, but also to the\r\ndissemination of knowledge of various kinds and to the care of the\r\nsick and maimed. In a word, they were--like the Aesculapian temples at\r\nTrikka, Epidaurus and Cos, of which some account will be given farther\r\non--both hospitals for the treatment of disease and schools for the\r\ntraining of physicians. The chief priest of the temple bore also the\r\ntitle of the “physician-in-chief,” and exercised the prerogatives of\r\na chief magistrate. Under this system medical knowledge advanced to\r\na certain stage and then made no further progress. The preponderance\r\nof the priestly (_i.e._, the superstitious) influence was too\r\npronounced to permit anything like real progress.\r\n\r\nThe papyrus Ebers makes mention of a number of diseases, and among them\r\nthe following may be noted: abdominal affections (probably dysentery),\r\nintestinal worms, inflammations in the region of the anus, hemorrhoids,\r\npainful disorders at the pit of the stomach, diseases of the heart,\r\npains in the head, urinary affections, dyspepsia, swellings in the\r\nregion of the neck, angina, a form of disease of the liver, about\r\nthirty different affections of the eyes, diseases of the hair, diseases\r\nof the skin, diseases of women, diseases of children, affections of the\r\nnose, ears and teeth, tumors, abscesses and ulcers.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of diagnosis the Egyptian physicians not only employed\r\ninspection and palpation, but were in the habit of examining the urine.\r\nA statement made in the papyrus Ebers is good ground for the belief\r\nthat they also employed auscultation to some extent.\r\n\r\nTherapeutics constituted beyond all question the strongest part of\r\nEgyptian medicine. As might be expected from the strange mixture of the\r\npriest and the medical man in every physician, the remedial measures\r\ncommonly employed consisted in part of prayers and incantations, and\r\nin part of rational procedures and the use of drugs. Among the latter\r\nclass of remedies the following deserve to be mentioned: emetics,\r\ncathartics and clysters. Bloodletting, sudorifics, diuretics and\r\nsubstances which cause sneezing were also often employed in Egypt. To\r\nproduce vomiting the favorite agents were the copper salts and oxymel\r\nof squills. Castor oil disguised in beer was given as an aperient.\r\nPomegranate was the drug preferred for the expulsion of worms.\r\nMandragora and opium were also employed as remedies. Foreign drugs\r\nwere largely imported by the Phoenicians, and in their successful\r\ncampaigns against Asiatic nations the Egyptians learned much about\r\nthe use of these rarer remedies. The different forms in which the\r\nEgyptians administered their remedies included potions, electuaries,\r\ngums to be chewed but not swallowed, gargles, snuffs, inhalations,\r\nsalves, plasters, poultices, injections, suppositories, clysters and\r\nfumigations. The physicians, in their practice, were subjected to very\r\nstrict rules regarding the amount of the doses to be given and the\r\nmanner of administering the different remedies, and consequently they\r\nreceived no encouragement to indulge in any individuality of action.\r\nThe prescriptions were written in very much the same manner as are\r\nthose of to-day; that is, they contained the fundamental or important\r\ndrugs, certain accessory materials, and something which was intended\r\nmerely to correct the unpleasant taste of the mixture. In comparison\r\nwith those commonly written at a somewhat later period these ancient\r\nprescriptions were of a very simple character.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time the researches of the archaeologists have thrown\r\ncomparatively little light on the surgery of the ancient Egyptians.\r\nThe facts already ascertained, however, are sufficient to warrant the\r\nstatement that they had reached a degree of knowledge and skill in\r\nthis department of medicine well in advance of that reached by any of\r\ntheir contemporaries. They performed the operations of circumcision\r\nand castration, and they removed tumors, and their eye surgeons were\r\nespecially renowned for the work which they accomplished in their\r\nspecial department. Their skill in manufacturing surgical instruments\r\nis amply revealed in the specimens--instruments for cupping, knives,\r\nhooks, forceps of different kinds, metal sounds and probes, etc.--which\r\nhave been dug up at the various sites of ancient ruins. They must also\r\nhave possessed considerable manual skill, for without it they could\r\nnot, in embalming a corpse, have removed the entire brain from the\r\nskull with a long hook, by way of the nasal passages, and at the same\r\ntime have left the form of the face undisturbed.\r\n\r\nFrom Joachim’s German translation of the papyrus Ebers,[9] as quoted by\r\nNeuburger, I copy the following passages:--\r\n\r\n   If thou findest, in some part of the surface of a patient’s\r\n   body, a tumor due to a collection of pus, and dost observe\r\n   that at one well-defined spot it rises up into a noticeable\r\n   prominence, of rounded form, thou should’st say to thyself: This\r\n   is a collection of pus, which is forming among the tissues; I\r\n   will treat the disease with the knife.... If thou findest, in\r\n   the throat of a patient, a small tumor containing pus, and dost\r\n   observe that it presents at one point a well-defined prominence\r\n   like a wart, thou may’st conclude that pus is collecting at\r\n   this point.... If thou findest, in a patient’s throat, a fatty\r\n   growth which resembles an abscess, but which yields a peculiar\r\n   sensation of softness under the pressure of the finger, say to\r\n   thyself: this man has a fatty tumor in his throat; I will treat\r\n   the disease with the knife, but at the same time I will be\r\n   careful to avoid the blood-vessels.\r\n\r\nThese short extracts will suffice to show that the Egyptian physicians\r\nof that early period--at least 1550 B. C.--reasoned about pathological\r\nlesions in very much the same manner as a physician of to-day would\r\nreason. In this same ancient papyrus, however, foolish as well as\r\nsensible statements appear. Thus, for example, mention is made on the\r\none hand of the fact that, in order to give a certain remedy to an\r\ninfant, it is sufficient to administer it to the nurse who suckles the\r\nchild (a proceeding which is not uncommon in our own day); and then,\r\nin another part of the text, it is stated that “if, on the day of its\r\nbirth, the infant does not cry, it will surely live; but, if it says\r\n‘ba,’ it will die.”\r\n\r\nIn matters relating to personal hygiene the ancient Egyptians often\r\ndisplayed a remarkable degree of common sense. They maintained, for\r\nexample, that the majority of diseases are due to the taking of\r\nfood in excessive quantity; and, in harmony with this belief, they\r\nintroduced the custom of devoting three days out of every thirty to\r\nthe taking of emetics and clysters. Perhaps it was to this custom\r\nthat they owed their good health,--a fact to which both Herodotus and\r\nDiodorus testify. In principle this practice agrees with that adopted\r\nby modern physicians, who omit the emetics and substitute for the\r\nclysters the drinking of certain mineral waters during a limited period\r\nof the summer season and under the very agreeable surroundings of a\r\ncomfortable hotel at Carlsbad, Ems, Wiesbaden or Saratoga. While the\r\nmonthly plan of purging the system of harmful elements must certainly\r\nhave been the more effective of the two, it cannot for a moment be\r\ndoubted that exceedingly few moderns would be willing to subject\r\nthemselves to such a régime.\r\n\r\nIn still other ways the ancient Egyptians displayed a most intelligent\r\nrespect for every measure that tended to promote the general health of\r\nthe community. They took care, for example, to prevent the entrance\r\nof decomposing materials into the soil and the ground water; priests\r\nskilled in work of this character made careful inspections of all meats\r\nthat were to be used for food; stress was laid upon the importance of\r\nkeeping the dwelling houses clean; the people were taught the value\r\nof bathing the body frequently, of cultivating gymnastic exercises,\r\nof clothing themselves suitably, and of employing the right sort of\r\ndiet. At a still later period of their history they adopted the custom\r\nof drinking only water that had been either boiled or filtered. A\r\nparticular kind of beer, the gift of their first king, Osiris, was\r\nthe favorite beverage of the people. It was made from barley and\r\ndoubtless possessed intoxicating properties, as is suggested by one\r\nof the papyrus texts in which the following charge is brought against\r\na student: “Thou hast abandoned thy books and art devoting thyself to\r\nidle pleasures, going from one beer-house to another. Thou smellest so\r\nstrongly of beer that men avoid thee.”\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the sources of information regarding the medicine\r\nof the ancient Egyptians have been brought to light during recent\r\nyears, but so many gaps in the series still remain unfilled that it is\r\nnot possible to furnish more than a disconnected and very imperfect\r\naccount. Archaeological investigations, however, are being conducted\r\nwith vigor and new discoveries are reported almost every month. There\r\nare therefore good reasons for hoping that, in the course of the next\r\nfew years, much additional light will be shed on the mode of life and\r\naccomplishments of these pioneers of civilization, who, before they\r\npassed out of history, succeeded in attaining the highest degree of\r\ncultivation in the science and art of medicine that had up to that\r\ntime been attained by any other nation. One thing is certain, says\r\nNeuburger, they exerted a powerful influence upon the beginning of\r\nmedicine in Greece and upon the social hygiene of the Jewish people,\r\nand therefore upon the human race at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                     ORIENTAL MEDICINE (Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Medicine of the Ancient Persians._--After Cyrus the Great had\r\nput an end to Babylon as a power among the nations the Persians became\r\nthe leaders in all the affairs not merely of Asia Minor but also of\r\nthe entire country from India to the shores of the Mediterranean; in\r\nfact, they eventually also gained control of the land of the Pharaohs.\r\nNotwithstanding the completeness of the political power which they\r\npossessed over these conquered races, they permitted them to retain\r\ntheir respective religions and even their individual languages;\r\nas evidence of the correctness of which last statement the modern\r\ndiscovery of inscriptions written in the three principal tongues may be\r\nmentioned. The remarkable degree of general culture which existed at\r\nBabylon at the time of the Persian conquest, and which the Sumerians\r\nand Semites had originally introduced, was left undisturbed by the\r\npolitical change.\r\n\r\nSo far as we possess any knowledge regarding the medicine of the\r\nancient Persians, this information has been derived, according to\r\nNeuburger, from the Zend-Avesta--one of the ancient religious writings\r\npreserved by the Parsees. It furnishes comparatively few facts of\r\nspecial interest to physicians. In the main, the practice of medicine\r\nmust have differed very little from that employed by the earliest\r\nBabylonian physicians, and briefly described on pages 11–16. There are\r\none or two additional matters, however, which deserve to be mentioned\r\nhere. It was maintained, for example, that the touching of a corpse\r\nproduced a special contamination, a belief which interfered most\r\nseriously with the study of anatomy, and therefore prevented any\r\nreal advance in medical knowledge. Then, again, the ancient Persians\r\nappear to have taken comparatively little interest in surgery, for it\r\nis said that King Darius I. was obliged, when he needed treatment for\r\na badly sprained ankle, to send for a Greek physician. Finally, there\r\nmay be found in Herodotus the following statement, which shows that the\r\nPersians had learned something of value, in practical hygiene, from\r\ntheir neighbors, the Egyptians:--\r\n\r\n   The Great King (Cyrus), when he goes to the wars, is always\r\n   supplied with provisions carefully prepared at home, and with\r\n   cattle of his own. Water, too, from the river Choaspes, which\r\n   flows by Susa, is taken with him for his drink, as that is the\r\n   only water which the kings of Persia taste. Wherever he travels,\r\n   he is attended by a number of four-wheeled cars drawn by mules,\r\n   in which the Choaspes water, ready boiled for use, and stored in\r\n   flagons of silver, is moved with him from place to place.[10]\r\n\r\nNeuburger makes the remark that the ancient Persians are entitled to\r\nthe gratitude of later generations for the valuable service which they\r\nrendered the science of medicine, inasmuch as, during the dynasty of\r\nthe Sassanide princes (fifth century A. D.) and at a time when European\r\nculture was hastening to its destruction, they gave shelter both to\r\nclassical culture in general and to the medical knowledge of the\r\nGreeks, and then afterward handed it over to the conquering Arabs, who\r\npassed it on to our forefathers.\r\n\r\n_The Medicine of the Old Testament._--There are no medical\r\nwritings which give any information concerning the science and art of\r\nmedicine as possessed by the ancient Israelites, but the Bible contains\r\na number of passages that refer to matters which belong in the domain\r\nof medicine, and more particularly in that of social hygiene. The\r\nmosaic laws were framed with a view to the good of the Jewish people\r\nas a whole, and were directed to such matters as the prevention and\r\nsuppression of epidemic diseases, the combating venereal affections\r\nand prostitution, the care of the skin, the systematizing of work,\r\nthe regulation of sexual life, the intellectual cultivation of the\r\nrace, the provision of suitable clothing, dwellings and food, the use\r\nof baths, etc. Many of these laws--like those, for example, which\r\nprescribe rest on the Sabbath day, circumcision, abstinence from eating\r\nthe flesh of the pig, the isolation of persons affected with leprosy,\r\nthe observation of hygienic rules in camp life, etc.--testify to a\r\nremarkably high degree of the power to reason correctly; and, when\r\nconsidered in the light of modern science, they seem to justify the\r\nprediction made in Deuteronomy iv., 6. A similar prediction (supposed\r\nto be spoken by God from Mount Sinai) is made in Exodus xix., 6: “And\r\nye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.” That a\r\nlarge part of the credit given to Moses for the wisdom displayed in\r\nthese sanitary laws really belongs to the Egyptians is shown by the\r\ntext of Acts vii., 22: “And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the\r\nEgyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.”\r\n\r\nAs regards the manner in which the Israelites treated the diseases\r\nwhich afflicted them the Bible furnishes ample proof of the fact\r\nthat they placed their chief reliance upon prayers, sacrifices, and\r\nofferings at their temples, and made comparatively small use of\r\nmedicinal agents, dietetic measures, and external applications. The\r\nfavorable effect of David’s harp-playing upon the melancholia of King\r\nSaul furnishes the only instance, to be found in the Bible, of the\r\ncurative value of music in certain mental disorders.\r\n\r\nThe story of Naaman (2 Kings v.) deserves to be mentioned briefly here.\r\nHe was captain of the host of the King of Syria (about 894 B. C.) and\r\na man of valor, highly esteemed by his master, but he was--according\r\nto the Bible statement--a leper. Learning casually that there was\r\nin Samaria a prophet who might be able to cure his disease, he put\r\na large sum of money into his sack and departed for that country.\r\n“So Naaman came with his horses and with his chariot, and stood at\r\nthe door of the house of Elisha. And Elisha sent a messenger unto\r\nhim, saying, Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall\r\ncome again to thee, and thou shalt be clean.” Naaman, at first much\r\ndispleased with the advice given to him by Elisha, and especially by\r\nthe very informal manner in which it had been communicated to him,\r\nfinally decided to follow the prophet’s instructions. “Then went he\r\ndown, and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, ... and his flesh came\r\nagain like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. And he\r\nreturned to the man of God, ... and came, and stood before him; and\r\nhe said, Behold, now I know that there is no God in all the earth,\r\nbut in Israel: now therefore, I pray thee, take a blessing of thy\r\nservant.” Elisha, however, refused persistently to accept any reward\r\nfor the advice which he had given. He simply said to Naaman: “Go in\r\npeace.” Before he departed, however, Naaman expressed to Elisha the\r\nhope that he would be pardoned if he yielded to the necessity of bowing\r\ndown to the god Rimmon on certain occasions--as, for example, when he\r\naccompanied his master, the king, on his visits to the temple of that\r\ngod for the purposes of worship. From the evidence furnished by this\r\naccount, as given in the Old Testament, it is fair to assume that both\r\nNaaman and the writer of the book of Kings believed that the cure had\r\nbeen effected by supernatural means. The modern physician, however,\r\nis not ready to accept such an interpretation of the manner in which\r\nNaaman’s cure was effected, but prefers to believe that the supposed\r\nleprosy was in reality some curable form of skin disease which to\r\nthe unprofessional eye appeared like the other malady. It might, for\r\nexample, have been an aggravated general eczema, dependent upon such\r\nexcesses of eating and drinking as a wealthy captain of the king’s host\r\nwould be likely to indulge in. And if this supposition is correct, one\r\ncannot but admire the great practical wisdom of Elisha in advising\r\nNaaman to take seven baths--one a day presumably--in the river Jordan,\r\na spot so far removed from his home that it would scarcely be possible\r\nfor him to obtain any but the simplest kind of diet during this\r\ncomparatively long period of time.\r\n\r\nAn interesting case of snake-bite is briefly related in Acts xxviii.,\r\n3–6. It is stated that “when Paul (after being shipwrecked on the\r\nIsland of Melita) had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the\r\nfire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand. And\r\nwhen the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said\r\namong themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath\r\nescaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live. And he shook off\r\nthe beast into the fire, and felt no harm. Howbeit they looked when he\r\nshould have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had\r\nlooked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their\r\nminds, and said that he was a god.” This narrative is interesting in\r\nseveral respects, but there is one feature that deserves to receive\r\nspecial mention, viz., the fact that Paul experienced no harm from the\r\nbite of a poisonous serpent--a wound which frequently proves fatal.\r\nInasmuch as the account distinctly states that the reptile “fastened on\r\nhis hand” and that “the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his\r\nhand,” the conclusion is warranted that one or both of the creature’s\r\nfangs had entered the hand by a curving route, and probably in such\r\na manner that the free end of each fang, from which the poison is\r\nejected, passed completely through the skin from within outward. When\r\nthe bite of a poisonous snake is of a character such as I have just\r\ndescribed,--and not a few of them have this character,--only a very\r\nsmall quantity of the venom is lodged in the subcutaneous tissues,\r\nwhere the larger blood- and lymph-channels lie, and as a consequence the\r\nperson bitten escapes serious harm. On the other hand, when the fangs\r\nenter the flesh in a less decidedly curving direction, thus permitting\r\na greater quantity of the venom to reach and remain in the deep-lying\r\ntissues, serious or even fatal results may be anticipated. The point,\r\nthen, which I desire to make is simply this: Paul’s escape from death\r\nin this instance may perfectly well be ascribed to natural causes.\r\n\r\nThe Israelites, at a certain stage of their history, appear to have\r\ncompletely divorced the practice of medicine from the priestly\r\nfunction. In one place, for example, it is stated that King Asa sought\r\nrelief from his ailment, not from Jehovah, but from the physicians.\r\nJeremiah expresses astonishment that not a single physician is to\r\nbe found in Gilead. May this not be interpreted as signifying that\r\nregularly established physicians were at that time (595 B. C.) to be\r\nfound in some parts of Palestine? And, at a much earlier period (1500\r\nB. C.), Job calls his friends “physicians of no value” (Job xiii.,\r\niv.). From these and a number of other statements in the Bible it seems\r\npermissible to believe that, at a very early period of history, the\r\nJewish physicians occupied an entirely independent position.\r\n\r\nIt would doubtless appear strange to most readers of this brief sketch\r\nof the history of medicine if some reference were not made in this\r\nplace to Luke, the author of the gospel which bears his name and of\r\nthe Acts of the Apostles, and who was also the companion of Paul on\r\nhis journey to Rome and during a portion of the latter’s stay in that\r\ncity. Luke was a native of Antioch, in Syria, and not a Jew. He was\r\na physician and tradition says that he was also a painter. It is not\r\nknown where he received his medical training, but it is not at all\r\nunlikely that he studied at Alexandria, in Egypt, where the greatest\r\nfacilities for such training, obtainable at that period, were to\r\nbe found. His style of writing shows plainly that he was a man of\r\nconsiderable cultivation and endowed with a clear and logical mind; and\r\nif he had not possessed a genial personality he would hardly have been\r\nknown as “the beloved physician”; nor could any other motive but those\r\nof loyal, self-sacrificing friendship for his friend, and a desire to\r\npromote the cause of Christianity, have led him to share with Paul the\r\ndangers and discomforts of the journey to Rome.\r\n\r\n_The Medicine of India, China and Japan._--It would be too much\r\nof a departure from the plan which is being followed in the writing of\r\nthis history to attempt to describe, even in the briefest manner, the\r\nmode of development of the science and art of medicine in India, China\r\nand Japan. Unquestionably the earlier physicians of these countries\r\nmade many valuable contributions to medical knowledge, but they were\r\nmade at such a period of time, or under such conditions, that they\r\ncould not have exerted an appreciable influence upon the development\r\nof medicine in ancient Greece,--certainly no such influence as was\r\nexerted by Assyria and Persia, and especially by Egypt. It therefore\r\nseems permissible to speak of the medicine of these more remote\r\ncountries only incidentally, and not as an integral part of the series\r\nof centres of learning which made the medicine of ancient Greece the\r\ndirect ancestor--if I may use such a term--of European medicine.[11]\r\nIn conformity with this idea it will be well to mention here briefly\r\na few of the more important facts relating to the achievements of the\r\nphysicians of the three countries named.\r\n\r\nThe most celebrated medical authors in India were Caraka, Súsruta and\r\nVagbhata--“The ancient trinity,” as they were called. Caraka probably\r\nlived during the early part of the Christian era, Súsruta during the\r\nfifth century, and Vagbhata not later than during the seventh century\r\nA. D. It is apparent, therefore, that none of the treatises written\r\nby these authors could have exerted the slightest influence upon the\r\ngrowth of medical knowledge in ancient Greece.\r\n\r\nThe crudeness of many of the conceptions held by these Hindu physicians\r\nconcerning pathology is revealed in the following definition:\r\n“Health is the expression of the normal composition of the three\r\nelementary substances (air, mucus and bile) which play a vital\r\npart in the machinery of the human body, and it is also dependent\r\nupon the existence of normal quantitative relations between these\r\nthree substances; and when the latter are damaged, or when they are\r\nabnormally increased or diminished, then disease of one kind or another\r\nmakes its appearance.”[12]\r\n\r\nGreat stress was laid by the physicians as well as by the priests of\r\nancient India upon the observance of very elaborate rules respecting\r\nthe care of the person while in health and, very naturally, when a\r\npatient became ill the physician in charge paid quite as much attention\r\nto the employment of hygienic and dietetic measures in effecting the\r\ndesired cure as to the administering of drugs.\r\n\r\nThe list of the commonly employed hygienic measures is too long for\r\nreproduction in its entirety in this brief sketch, but an enumeration\r\nof some of the more important items may prove interesting. In\r\nestimating the value of these rules the reader should bear in mind\r\nthat they were intended for people living in a hot climate. Daily\r\nbathing heads the list. Then follow: regulation of the bowels; rubbing\r\nthe teeth with fresh twigs of certain trees which possess astringent\r\nproperties, and also brushing them twice a day; rinsing the mouth with\r\nappropriate washes; rubbing the eyes with salves; anointing the body\r\nwith perfumed oils; cutting the nails every five days, etc. Two meals\r\na day were prescribed--the first one between nine in the morning and\r\nnoon, and the second between seven and ten in the evening. “Only a\r\nmoderate amount of water should be drunk during the meal; drinking\r\nwater at the beginning of a meal delays digestion, while a copious\r\ndraught at the end produces obesity. After the meal the mouth should\r\nbe carefully cleansed and a short walk should be taken.” Among the\r\nmore important articles of food the following deserve to be mentioned:\r\nrice, ripe fruit, the ordinary vegetables, ginger, garlic, salt, milk,\r\noil, melted butter, honey and sugar cane. If meat is eaten, preference\r\nshould be given to venison, wild fowl and the flesh of the buffalo.\r\nThe meat of the pig, and beef, as well as fish, are less conducive\r\nto health. Gymnastic exercises in moderation are beneficial. Sleep\r\nshould be indulged in during the day only after some specially severe\r\nexercise; at night it should not be extended beyond one hour before\r\nsunrise. Bathing immediately after eating is harmful, and it is not to\r\nbe indulged in when one is affected with a cold, with a high fever,\r\nwith diarrhoea, or with some disease of the eyes or ears. A hot bath\r\nor washing with warm water may be beneficial for the lower half of the\r\nbody, but for the upper half it is harmful. Sea bathing and cold baths\r\n(preferably in the river Ganges) are beneficial. The clothing worn\r\nshould be clean; soiled garments are likely to produce skin diseases.\r\nIt is advisable to wear shoes, and an umbrella or a staff should be\r\ncarried. The wearing of garlands, finery, and jewels increases the\r\nvital powers and keeps away evil spirits. The following are good\r\nmeasures to adopt for the preservation of health: an emetic once a\r\nweek; a laxative once a month; and a bloodletting twice a year. All\r\nthe measures enumerated above were subject to modification according\r\nto changes in the season, the locality, the weather, and various other\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nIn harmony with the extraordinary fruitfulness of the land the\r\npharmacopoeia of India is very rich. It is a remarkable fact that not\r\none of the numerous drugs mentioned in the official list is of European\r\norigin. The great majority of them belong to the vegetable kingdom;\r\nCaraka stating that he knew of 500 plants that possessed remedial\r\nvirtues, while Súsruta placed the number at 760. Then, too, the list\r\ncontains a goodly number of drugs which belong, some to the animal and\r\nothers to the mineral kingdom. It appears that the physicians of India\r\nbegan using mineral substances, both externally and internally, at a\r\nvery early period of their history. Among such substances the following\r\nmay be mentioned: sulphate of copper, sulphate of iron, sulphate of\r\nlead, oxide of lead, sulphur, arsenic, borax, alum, potash, chloride\r\nof ammonium, gold, precious stones of different kinds, etc. The people\r\nof India were skilled in chemical and pharmaceutical work. The drugs\r\nwere prepared by them in a great variety of ways--as, for instance,\r\nextracts of the juices of plants, infusions, decoctions, electuaries,\r\nmixtures, syrups, pills, pastes, powders, suppositories, collyria,\r\nsalves, etc. Practicing physicians carried with them a sort of portable\r\nmedicine chest, and they often collected, themselves, the medicinal\r\nplants which they required. Súsruta gives instructions as to the spots\r\nwhere certain plants are most likely to be found, and as to the seasons\r\nwhen they should be gathered. Charlatanry and mysticism often played a\r\npart in this business. Thus, it was maintained that drugs collected and\r\nprepared by persons other than physicians did not produce the desired\r\neffects. The fact that cosmetics (especially hair dyes), “elixirs of\r\nlife,” aphrodisiacs, poisons and antidotes for poisons, occupy the most\r\nprominent place in the list of pharmaceutic preparations sold, casts\r\na glaring ray of light, as Neuburger states, on the degree of culture\r\namong the people of ancient India.\r\n\r\nThe list of separate maladies recognized by the physicians of the\r\nlatter country is inordinately long. There were 26 kinds of fevers, 13\r\nspecies of swellings of the lower abdomen, 20 different diseases due to\r\nworms, 20 kinds of urinary diseases, 8 varieties of strangury, 5 kinds\r\nof jaundice, 5 varieties of cough or asthma, 18 kinds of “leprosy,” 6\r\nkinds of abscesses, 76 different eye diseases, 28 affections of the\r\near, 65 disorders of the mouth, 31 nasal affections, 18 diseases of\r\nthe throat, a large number of mental disorders, etc. It seems scarcely\r\nnecessary to remark that these so-called diseases were in reality\r\nonly groups of certain types of loosely related symptoms. The term\r\n“leprosy,” for example, included, besides the disease which modern\r\nphysicians call by that name, a number of different affections of the\r\nskin. It is worth noting here that diabetes mellitus, which is one\r\nof the twenty different kinds of urinary diseases enumerated in the\r\nclassified list mentioned above, was first described by the physicians\r\nof India, whose attention was directed to the disorder by observing\r\nthat flies and other insects were attracted to the urine of these\r\npatients by reason of its sweetness. It is also an interesting fact\r\nthat occasionally these physicians, who, beyond a doubt, were keen\r\nobservers of symptoms, paid some attention to the anatomical features\r\nof the individual cases. Thus, it is stated that the particular form of\r\nswelling of the lower abdomen, to which they applied the name “splenic\r\nbelly,” is dependent upon “an enlarged spleen which distends the left\r\nside, is as hard as a stone, and is arched like the back of a turtle”;\r\nwhereas they spoke of “an enlargement of the liver” when very much the\r\nsame conditions were observed on the right side of the abdomen. The\r\naccuracy of their clinical observations is particularly noticeable in\r\ntheir accounts of cases of consumption, apoplexy, epilepsy, hemicrania,\r\ntetanus, rheumatism, venereal diseases, some affections of the skin,\r\nand insanity. It was in their surgical technique, however, that\r\nthe physicians of ancient India were distinguished above all their\r\nbrethren of the neighboring oriental countries, and this superiority\r\nthey maintained for a very long time. Among the operations which they\r\nperformed the following may be mentioned: they removed tumors by\r\nexcising them, they opened abscesses by the use of the knife, they\r\nemployed scarifications (in inflammations of the throat) and made\r\npunctures (in hydrocele and ascites), they passed probes into fistulae,\r\nthey extracted foreign bodies, and they employed needles armed with\r\nhairs taken from the horsed tail or with thread composed of flax or\r\nhemp. According to Súsruta their stock of instruments was composed of\r\n101 blunt and 20 cutting instruments. Among those which were blunt\r\nthere were forceps of different sizes and forms, hooks, tubes, probes\r\nor sounds, catheters, bougies, etc. They made use of the magnet\r\nfor drawing out foreign bodies of iron, and they applied cups for\r\ntherapeutic purposes. Their cutting instruments consisted of knives,\r\nbistouris, lancets, scissors, trochars, needles, etc. Steel was the\r\nmetal of which they were made; for the people of India learned at a\r\nvery early period how to make steel. In suitable cases cauterization,\r\neither with the actual cautery or with caustic potash, was a favorite\r\nmethod of treatment with the surgeons of ancient India. “Burning with\r\nthe heated iron,” they taught, “is more effective than cauterization\r\nwith potash, inasmuch as it permanently cures diseases which may not be\r\ncured by either drugs, surgical instruments, or chemical cauterizing\r\nagents.” In cases of enlargement of the spleen they plunged red-hot\r\nneedles into the parenchyma of the organ, presumably through the\r\nskin and other overlying tissues. There were fourteen different\r\nkinds of surgical dressings; cotton, woolen, linen and silk being\r\nthe materials used for bandages, and strips of bamboo or some other\r\nwood for splints. When the conditions permitted such a proceeding,\r\nit was customary to sew up wounds of the head, face and windpipe.\r\nFurthermore, it was the rule to perform all surgical operations at a\r\ntime when the constellations were favorable. Religious ceremonies were\r\nperformed both before the operation and after it was completed, and\r\nit was also considered necessary that the operator should face the\r\nwest and the patient the east. Intoxication was employed as a means\r\nof securing narcosis. Owing to their scrupulous cleanliness and the\r\nminute attention which they paid to details, the surgeons of ancient\r\nIndia obtained for a long time a much higher degree of success than\r\ndid the surgeons of other oriental nations. At the same time they were\r\nnot lacking in that degree of boldness which enables an operator--in\r\ncritical cases which probably without such prompt and radical action\r\nwould terminate fatally--to save life. For example, they did not\r\nhesitate to open the abdominal cavity and to sew up a wound in the\r\nintestines; they cut for stone in the bladder, employing for this\r\npurpose the lateral method of operating; and they performed a great\r\nvariety of plastic operations.\r\n\r\nSome of their hygienic rules concerning pregnant and nursing women\r\nare eminently practical; others would hardly be approved by modern\r\naccoucheurs. Here are a few of these rules: During the period of a\r\nwoman’s pregnancy close attention should be paid to her diet, and\r\nspecial care should be exercised by her to avoid excesses or errors\r\nof any kind. When the ninth month is reached she should take up her\r\nabode in the small cottage in which she is eventually to be confined--a\r\nbuilding erected with special religious ceremonies and thoroughly\r\nfitted with everything that is likely to conduce to her comfort. At\r\nthe time of the actual confinement she should have with her four\r\nfemale assistants, and all those measures, of either a religious or a\r\npractical character, which have in view the hastening of the birth of\r\nthe infant, should be scrupulously carried out. If any delay in the\r\ndelivery of the after-birth occurs, the removal of the mass may be\r\npromoted by the employment of well-directed pressure over the lower\r\npart of the abdomen, by shaking the body, and also, if necessary, by\r\ngiving an emetic. The woman in childbed should not be allowed to get\r\nup before the tenth day after her confinement, and for a period of\r\nsix weeks her diet should be most carefully watched. On the third day\r\nthe child should be put to the mother’s breast; up to that time it\r\nshould be given only honey and butter. If the mother, for any reason,\r\nis not able to suckle the infant, a wet-nurse should be employed for\r\nthe purpose, but not until the physician shall have subjected her to\r\na most thorough examination and shall have instructed her minutely in\r\nregard to her own diet. The subsequent care of the child was provided\r\nfor in the most particular manner: It was restricted to a carefully\r\nplanned diet; it was not allowed to sit or to lie except in certain\r\nprescribed positions; its times for sleeping were strictly ordered;\r\nit was permitted to amuse itself only in certain ways;--in brief,\r\neverything was done according to strict rules, even special precautions\r\nbeing taken to guard the child, during the first years of life, against\r\ndangerous demons. Weaning began after the sixth month, and for a\r\ncertain length of time the child was fed largely on rice. In cases of\r\ndifficult labor and in their gynaecological practice the physicians of\r\nancient India did not manifest any special knowledge or skill.\r\n\r\nOne of the instructions given to young physicians in India when they\r\nwere about to enter upon the practice of their profession, may be\r\nof interest to the reader. It is worded as follows: “Let thy hair\r\nand finger-nails be cut short, keep thy body clean, put on white\r\ngarments, wear shoes on thy feet, and carry a staff or umbrella in thy\r\nhand. Thy demeanor should be humble, and thy heart pure and free from\r\ndeceitfulness.” The following proverb, although it originated in India,\r\nis well worthy of acceptance in every part of the world: “When you are\r\nill the physician will be to you a father; when you have recovered from\r\nyour illness you will find him a friend; and when your health is fully\r\nre-established he will act as your protector.”\r\n\r\nOn a previous page the statement has been made that the science and\r\nart of medicine developed in ancient Greece quite independently of\r\nany influence that might have been exerted by the teachings of the\r\nphysicians of India. This statement should be somewhat modified, for it\r\nis reasonable to suppose, although directly confirmatory evidence has\r\nnot yet been discovered, that, through the channels of trade between\r\nthe two countries, some knowledge of the doings of the physicians\r\nof India must have reached the ears of their Greek brethren. On the\r\nother hand, at a later period of history (after Alexander the Great\r\nhad invaded India), the relations between the two countries became\r\nquite close and were kept up without a break for several hundred\r\nyears. During the earlier part of this later period, as appears from\r\nthe writings of Hippocrates, Dioscorides and Galen, various drugs and\r\nmethods of treatment employed by the physicians of India were adopted\r\nby the practitioners of Greece.\r\n\r\n_Medicine of the Chinese and Japanese._--The isolation of China\r\nwith respect to those countries which were within comparatively easy\r\nreach and in which there was a civilization that, already several\r\nthousand years before the Christian era, had attained a remarkable\r\ndegree of development (India, Babylonia and Egypt, for example); her\r\nblind belief in authority; her unwillingness to tolerate any influences\r\nthat seemed to emanate from foreigners; and her complete satisfaction\r\nwith her own methods of doing things, with her own beliefs, and with\r\nher own natural and manufactured products,--these, it is generally\r\nbelieved, were the most important factors in keeping this remarkable\r\nnation in a state of immobility as regards at least some departments\r\nof human knowledge and accomplishment. This is particularly true in\r\nrespect of the science and art of medicine. But China is at last\r\nwaking up from this lethargic state. A wonderful change has come over\r\nher during the past twenty or thirty years, and she is now beginning\r\nto realize that, with her millions of population and wonderful\r\nnatural resources, she has an important part to play in advancing the\r\ncivilization of the world.\r\n\r\nThe preceding remarks must not be interpreted as signifying that,\r\nduring the long ages of the past, China has not been developing and\r\nis not able at the present time to show a record of very creditable\r\nwork accomplished in many departments of human activity. In her early\r\nhistory, many centuries ago, she accomplished great things, and all--so\r\nfar as we now know--without aid from neighboring nations; but there\r\ncame a time when all this creative activity ceased, and then, for long\r\nperiods of years, she appeared to rest satisfied with the advances\r\nwhich she had already made, and to have no further ambition to add to\r\nthe stock of her possessions.\r\n\r\nAmong the valuable things which should be credited to the Chinese\r\nare the following: the discovery of the compass (about 1100 B. C.),\r\nthe making of porcelain, the invention of printing, the raising of\r\nsilkworms, the manufacture of glass and of paper, the successful dyeing\r\nwith purple, embroidering with gold, working in metals, the artistic\r\ncutting of precious stones, enameling, the making of “India ink,” etc.\r\nFurthermore, it is a fact most creditable to the Chinese that in no\r\nother country in the world have scholars been held in such high esteem,\r\nor assigned so high a rank, as they have been and still are in China.\r\n\r\nChinese medicine possesses a very rich literature. The first medical\r\ntreatise, which deals with plants that possess medicinal virtues, is\r\nascribed to the Emperor Schin-Nung, who flourished about 2800 B. C.\r\nThis is the monarch who taught his people from which springs they\r\nshould drink, and who tested all the plants of his vast empire with\r\nreference to their healing properties. According to the legend the\r\nwall of his stomach was so thin that he could look through it and see\r\neverything that was going on in the interior of that organ. In this way\r\nhe was able to carry on a large series of experiments upon himself in\r\nregard to the action of different poisons and their antidotes. It is\r\nalso related that medical knowledge was still further advanced by the\r\nyellow Emperor Hoang-Ti who lived about 2650 B. C., and who is credited\r\nby the Chinese with having invented arithmetic and music. The treatise\r\ncalled “Noi-King,” which deals with the subject of internal diseases\r\nand gives a systematic account of human anatomy, is also credited\r\nby the Chinese to this monarch; but Neuburger maintains that this\r\nbook, which is still in common use in China, is of much more recent\r\norigin. There are several other medical treatises which deserve to be\r\nmentioned. Such, for example, are the following: the celebrated book on\r\nthe pulse, written by Wang-Schu-Scho in the third century B. C.; two\r\nvery important books written by Cho-Chiyu-Kei--one bearing the title\r\n“Schang-Han-Lun” (On Fevers) and the other that of “Kin-Kwéi” (Golden\r\nCasket);--the different treatises written by Tschang-Ki (tenth century\r\nA. D.) and published in the collection called “The Golden Mirror of\r\nthe Forefathers in Medicine” (I-Tsung-Kin-Kien); and, finally, the\r\nvery popular modern work (in forty volumes) entitled “The Trustworthy\r\nGuide in the Science and Art of Medicine” (“Ching-Che-Chun-Ching”). Of\r\nthese forty volumes, seven are devoted to nosology, eight to pharmacy,\r\nfive to pathology, six to surgery, and the remainder to children’s and\r\nwomen’s diseases.\r\n\r\nAnatomy, it appears, has never played other than a very insignificant\r\npart in the Chinese system of medicine. This is not to be wondered\r\nat when we remember that their religion makes the dissection of a\r\nhuman body a sin worthy of punishment. No mutilated person, the\r\nChinese believed, would be permitted, upon reaching the domain of\r\nthe dead, to rejoin his ancestors. About the year 1700 A. D. the\r\nEmperor Kang-Hi made the attempt to incorporate anatomy as a part\r\nof the regular study of medicine in the Chinese Empire; his first\r\nstep being the authorization of P. Perennin, a Jesuit Father, to\r\ntranslate Dionis’ work on anatomy into the Chinese. His efforts were,\r\nhowever, unsuccessful, owing to the strong opposition offered by the\r\nnative physicians. And the attempts made during more recent times\r\nto accomplish the desired reform by introducing copies of European\r\nanatomical illustrations do not appear, as yet, to have produced any\r\nappreciable impression. In very recent years, however, the medical\r\nmissionaries, sent out, if I am rightly informed, from the United\r\nStates, are giving excellent instruction in anatomy.\r\n\r\nPhysiology, as taught by the Chinese, is something beyond the\r\ncomprehension of modern Europeans. Neuburger explains their views\r\nin the following manner: “The cosmos is the product of the combined\r\naction of two dissimilar forces--the male (Yâng) and the female (Yin).\r\nWhen these forces work in harmony a state of equilibrium results....\r\nMatter consists of five elements, viz., wood, fire, earth, metal, and\r\nwater; and all things are composed of these elements. In sympathetic\r\nrelationship with these five elements stand the five planets (Jupiter,\r\nMars, Saturn, Venus, Mercury), the five different kinds of air (wind,\r\nheat, moisture, dryness, cold), the five quarters of the globe (east,\r\nsouth, west, north and the equator), the five periods of the year (in\r\naddition to the four which we recognize, the Chinese make a fifth\r\nperiod out of the last eighteen days of spring, summer, autumn and\r\nwinter), the five times of day, the five colors (green or blue, red,\r\nyellow, white and black), the five musical tones, etc.... As in the\r\ncosmos, so in man the two primeval forces--Yâng and Yin--underlie all\r\nhis vital processes. Thus, his body is made up of the five elements of\r\nwhich all matter is composed, and health depends upon the maintenance\r\nof a state of equilibrium between the male and the female forces,\r\netc.” After this brief exposition it seems unnecessary to devote any\r\nfurther space to the consideration of the physiological doctrines of\r\nthe Chinese.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the questions of diagnosis and prognosis it may be\r\nstated that the Chinese attach great importance to the necessity of\r\nmaking a most careful objective examination of the entire body; but,\r\nwhen one investigates the precise manner in which this examination is\r\nto be carried out, it soon appears that most of the details relate to\r\nmatters of a purely fanciful or mystical nature. The only steps of real\r\nimportance, according to them, are the examination of the patient’s\r\npulse and the inspection of his eyesight and his tongue. From the\r\nexamination of the pulse alone they believe it possible to diagnose\r\nthe nature and seat of the disease. To examine the pulse properly\r\nis a complicated affair and can scarcely be carried out in actual\r\npractice in less time than ten minutes; indeed, in certain cases the\r\nphysician may find it necessary to devote two or three hours to the\r\nbusiness. According to the Chinese scheme there are many different\r\nkinds of pulse, and there are no less than thirty-seven different types\r\nof condition presented by the tongue, each bearing its own special\r\npathological significance.\r\n\r\nDisease, so reads the Chinese doctrine, is a discord, a disturbance\r\nof equilibrium, caused by the preponderance of one or the other of\r\nthe primeval forces (the male or the female). It manifests itself\r\nin some disorder of the circulation of the vital air and the blood,\r\nand eventually involves the organs of the body. Wind, cold, dryness,\r\nmoisture, the emotions and passions, poisons, and also evil spirits and\r\nimaginary beasts are the causes of disease.\r\n\r\nNo other nation, says Neuburger, has at its command such a large number\r\nof remedial drugs; and it is also a fact, he adds, that the department\r\nof therapeutics is that in which Chinese medicine has reached its\r\nhighest development. The steadfast belief that in nature there exists\r\na remedy for every human ill led the physicians of that country to\r\nsearch diligently in all possible directions for vegetable and animal\r\nand also, to some extent, mineral substances which might possess\r\nremedial virtues. Although this search necessarily brought to notice\r\na lot of useless drugs, it cannot be denied that eventually it added a\r\nconsiderable number of remedies which have proved useful to the medical\r\nprofession of the entire world. In this category belong the following:\r\nrhubarb, pomegranate root as a cure for worms, camphor, aconite,\r\ncannabis, iron (for the relief of anaemia), arsenic (for malarial and\r\nskin diseases), sulphur and mercury (both of these for affections of\r\nthe skin), sodium sulphate, copper sulphate (as an emetic), alum,\r\nsal ammoniac and musk (for nervous affections). Toward the middle\r\nof the sixteenth century A. D. there was published, under the title\r\n“Pen-Tsao-Kang-Mu,” a monumental work (fifty-two volumes) in which are\r\nvery fully described no fewer than 1800 remedies, mostly of a vegetable\r\nnature. Prophylactic Inoculation with the pus from a small-pox pustule\r\nwas practised by the Chinese as long ago as during the eleventh century\r\nA. D., “thus constituting a forerunner of our modern serum therapy.”\r\n(Neuburger.) Vaccination was not introduced into China until during the\r\nnineteenth century of the present era. It is a curious fact that, in\r\nthe choice of a remedy, the Chinese physicians attach a certain degree\r\nof importance to the form and color of the drug, as symbols indicative\r\nof the effect which they may be expected to produce. Thus, the red\r\nblossoms of the hibiscus plant are believed to be more efficacious\r\nthan the white as an emmenagogue; saffron, being of a yellow color,\r\npossesses the power to relieve jaundice; beans that have the shape of\r\na kidney should be prescribed in cases of renal disease; glow-worms\r\nshould form a part of all eye-washes, etc.\r\n\r\nThe doses prescribed are very large, and the medicines are often put up\r\nin an attractive form, with labels on which such descriptive titles as\r\nthese are written: “Powders of the Three very wise Men,” or “Powders\r\nrecommended by Five Distinguished Physicians”--titles which are\r\ncalculated to work upon the imagination of the patient.\r\n\r\nThere are two methods of treatment which the Chinese physicians\r\nare very fond of employing for the relief of a great variety of\r\ndiseases--viz., acupuncture and cauterization of the skin over the\r\nseat of the malady by means of what are termed “moxae”--moxibustion.\r\nMoxae are prepared by kneading together into a cone-shaped, tinder-like\r\nmass the leaves of the artemisia vulgaris, then drying it thoroughly.\r\nSuch a mass is attached to the skin at the affected spot by simply\r\nmoistening the base of the cone, after which the apex is ignited. Some\r\nphysicians prefer to interpose a thin sheet of metal between the skin\r\nand the base of the moxa. The manner in which these contrivances should\r\nbe used in the different diseases and the proper number to employ are\r\nmatters subject to fixed rules. In a strong individual, for example,\r\nas many as fifty moxae may be used at a time. In affections of the\r\nchest they were applied to the patient’s back, in diseases of the\r\nstomach to the shoulders, and in venereal affections over the spinal\r\ncolumn. In acupuncture, which is a procedure invented by the Chinese,\r\nslender needles of gold, silver or highly tempered steel, from 5 to 22\r\ncentimetres (2 in.-8¼ in.) in length, were forced through the stretched\r\nskin to different depths (1¼ in.-1½ in.) and then driven farther inward\r\nin a rotary direction by means of a small hammer. The needles, after\r\nbeing allowed to remain in situ for a few minutes, were withdrawn, and\r\npressure was made with the hand over the small wounds, or a moxa was\r\nburned over the spot. There are in all 388 places where acupuncture may\r\nbe performed, and a chart of the body, showing where these places are\r\nlocated, has been prepared for the guidance of the Chinese physicians.\r\nNeuburger calls attention to the fact that the latter dislike the sight\r\nof blood, and that this is one of the reasons why acupuncture and the\r\nuse of moxae have grown to be such popular remedies. Bloodletting\r\nis rarely employed by them; but dry cupping, on the contrary, is a\r\nfavorite procedure in certain maladies. Massage is generally performed\r\nby old or blind women, and much attention is devoted to the “movement\r\ncure,” which is said to have been invented about 2500 B. C.\r\n\r\nAs may readily be imagined, the Chinese--owing to their dislike for the\r\nsight of blood and also by reason of their ignorance of anatomy--have\r\nnot advanced, in surgery, beyond the most primitive state of that art.\r\n\r\nThe science of public health is quite unknown in China. In a Chinese\r\ntreatise entitled “Long Life,” the following advice is given: “Always\r\nrise early in the morning, take some breakfast before you leave your\r\nresidence, drink a little tea before eating, at the mid-day meal\r\npartake of well-cooked but not too highly salted food, eat slowly, take\r\na nap of two hours after the meal, eat lightly at night, and, before\r\ngoing to bed, rinse your mouth with tea and have the soles of your feet\r\nrubbed until they are warm.” (Neuburger.)\r\n\r\nUp to the latter part of the nineteenth century of the present era,\r\nJapan, so far as medical matters are concerned, differed in no\r\nmaterial respect from China. During the last fifty or sixty years,\r\nhowever,--that is, since the visit of Commodore Perry, of the United\r\nStates Navy, to that country,--wonderful changes have taken place; and\r\nnow Japan, as a result of her determination to adopt the methods of\r\neducation, of utilizing steam and electric power, etc., has already\r\ntaken a leading place in the council of nations. The physicians, many\r\nof whom received their training in the best schools of Europe and\r\nthe United States, are contributing to-day their full share toward\r\nadvancing the science of medicine. That China is following in the\r\nfootsteps of Japan is already plainly evident, and no intelligent\r\nobserver entertains the slightest doubt of her ultimately--probably at\r\nno distant day--possessing a corps of medical men as well educated,\r\nas efficient in the treatment of disease, and as practical in public\r\nhygiene as their European and American confrères. During thousands\r\nof years China has suffered severely from the blighting tyranny of\r\nsuperstition, priestcraft and selfish bureaucracy, and, now that the\r\nsunlight of truth and genuine liberty is beginning to search every nook\r\nand cranny of that great country, we who have had the advantage of this\r\nbeneficent influence for so many scores of years truly rejoice over the\r\nchange that is taking place in China.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                 GREEK MEDICINE AT THE DAWN OF HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is from Greece and from Greece alone, says Daremberg, that our\r\nmodern medicine derives its origin.\r\n\r\n   It has come down to us, in a direct line, through the sheer\r\n   force of its inherent excellence, and with little or no aid from\r\n   outside sources. Harvey, Bichat and Broussais are as much the\r\n   legitimate heirs of Hippocrates, Herophilus, Galen, Berenger de\r\n   Carpi and Vesalius, as Hippocrates is the heir of Homer, and\r\n   as this divine singer of the anger of Achilles is himself the\r\n   product of a civilization that existed before his day and that\r\n   was in all probability the creation of Hindu influences.\r\n\r\nIt is to the development of medical knowledge in Greece, therefore,\r\nthat our attention should next be directed, and more particularly to\r\nthat period which belongs to the dawn of history--the pre-Homeric\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n_The pre-Homeric Period of Medicine in Greece._--The poems of\r\nHomer, the Iliad and the Odyssey, furnish us with the earliest and\r\nalmost the only written evidence of the state of medicine in Greece\r\nduring that period of time. They were probably written, according\r\nto the authority of the Earl of Derby, somewhere about 800 B. C.,\r\nand modern investigations show that the siege of Troy, the theme\r\nof the Iliad, occurred between the years 1194 and 1184 B. C. These\r\ninvestigations also show that in this region, and especially in the\r\nIsland of Crete and in Mycenae on the neighboring mainland of Asia\r\nMinor, at this time and probably several hundred years earlier, there\r\nexisted a high degree of civilization. Specimens of a written language,\r\nfor example, were found among the objects recovered from the ruins\r\nof the palace of King Minos at Cnossus in Crete, but hitherto no\r\ninterpreter of this unknown language has been found. It is reasonable\r\nto expect, however, that in due time these Minoan records will be\r\ntranslated, that still other records belonging to this remote age\r\nwill be discovered, and that much valuable information regarding the\r\ncondition of medical knowledge in Greece during this long period\r\nwill then be revealed to us. Strange as it may appear, the classical\r\nGreek writers seem to have possessed very little knowledge concerning\r\nthis highly developed civilization at Cnossus. And yet, if we stop\r\nto consider the matter, their silence will appear less strange for\r\nthe following reasons. Some great calamity (war, an earthquake, or a\r\nconflagration) must have destroyed many of the evidences of Minoan\r\ncivilization besides those which are now being brought to light; then,\r\nalso, several hundred years elapsed between the occurrence of this\r\ndisaster and the classical period of Greek culture; and, finally, there\r\nis the fact that the knowledge of past historical events, when kept\r\nalive simply by tradition, slowly vanishes, until finally it becomes\r\nso vague as to possess very little value. The discoveries made in the\r\nIsland of Crete and at Mycenae were not known to Daremberg when he\r\nwrote the lines quoted above, but he felt perfectly sure, from his\r\nknowledge of the laws of development in general, that a product so\r\nhighly cultured as Homer could not have suddenly sprung into existence\r\nout of the apparent darkness and ignorance of the centuries immediately\r\npreceding his time.\r\n\r\n_The State of Medical Knowledge at the Time of the Siege of\r\nTroy._--It is from Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey that our authoritative\r\nknowledge of the most ancient Greek medicine is derived. In the former\r\nwork mention is made of Aesculapius and his two sons, Machaon and\r\nPodalirius, both of whom accompanied Agamemnon and the Greek host in\r\ntheir expedition against Troy. According to this author’s account they\r\nserved in the double capacity of surgeons to the army and valiant\r\nleaders of troops. In order that the reader may judge for himself just\r\nwhat is the nature of the evidence furnished by Homer with regard to\r\nthe medical knowledge of that period, it seems desirable to introduce\r\nhere a few of the more characteristic references which the poet makes\r\nto spear, javelin and arrow wounds, to the injuries caused by fragments\r\nof rocks hurled by the assailants, and to various remedial measures,\r\nboth surgical and medical, employed for the relief of the wounded or\r\nsick warriors. There are at least one hundred such passages in the\r\nIliad alone, but the few which are here cited will serve as adequate\r\nexamples of Homer’s familiarity with anatomy and with some of the\r\nmethods of treating spear and arrow wounds,--a familiarity which\r\nindicates that the poet must have had some medical training.\r\n\r\n    Thus he; and not unmoved Machaon heard:\r\n    They through the crowd, and through the widespread host,\r\n    Together took their way; but when they came\r\n    Where fair-hair’d Menelaüs, wounded, stood,\r\n    Around him in a ring the best of Greece,\r\n    And in the midst the godlike chief himself,\r\n    From the close-fitting belt the shaft he drew,\r\n    With sharp return of pain; the sparkling belt\r\n    He loosen’d, and the doublet underneath,\r\n    And coat of mail, the work of Arm’rer’s hand.\r\n    But when the wound appeared in sight, where struck\r\n    The stinging arrow, from the clotted blood\r\n    He cleans’d it, and applied with skilful hand\r\n    The healing ointments, which, in friendly guise,\r\n    The learned Chiron to his father gave.\r\n                             (Book IV. of the Iliad, Lines 221–259.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He said: the spear, by Pallas guided, struck\r\n    Beside the nostril, underneath the eye;\r\n    Crashed through the teeth, and cutting through the tongue\r\n    Beneath the angle of the jaw came forth:\r\n    Down from the car he fell; and loudly rang\r\n    His glittering arms: aside the startled steeds\r\n    Sprang devious: from his limbs the spirit fled.\r\n    Down leaped Aeneas, spear and shield in hand,\r\n    Against the Greeks to guard the valiant dead;\r\n    And like a lion, fearless in his strength,\r\n    Around the corpse he stalk’d, this way and that,\r\n    His spear and buckler round before him held,\r\n    To all who dar’d approach him threatening death,\r\n    With fearful shouts; a rocky fragment then\r\n    Tydides lifted up, a mighty mass,\r\n    Which scarce two men could raise, as men are now:\r\n    But he, unaided, lifted it with ease.\r\n    With this he smote Aeneas near the groin,\r\n    Where the thigh bone, inserted in the hip,\r\n    Turns in the socket joint; the rugged mass\r\n    The socket crushed, and both the tendons broke,\r\n    And tore away the flesh: down on his knees,\r\n    Yet resting on his hand, the hero fell;\r\n    And o’er his eyes the shades of darkness spread.\r\n                                (The Iliad, Book V., Lines 333–356.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He said, and passing his supporting hand\r\n    Beneath his [Eurypylus’] breast, the wounded warrior led\r\n    Within the tent; th’ attendant saw, and spread\r\n    The ox-hide couch; then as he lay reclined,\r\n    Patroclus, with his dagger, from the thigh\r\n    Cut out the biting shaft; and from the wound\r\n    With tepid water cleans’d the clotted blood;\r\n    Then, pounded in his hands, a root applied\r\n    Astringent, anodyne, which all his pain\r\n    Allayed; the wound was dried, and stanch’d the blood.\r\n                               (The Iliad, Book XI., Lines 958–967.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But Jove-born Helen otherwise, meantime,\r\n    Employed, into the wine of which they drank\r\n    A drug infused, antidote to the pains\r\n    Of grief and anger, a most potent charm\r\n    For ills of every name.[13] Whoe’er his wine\r\n    So medicated drinks, he shall not pour\r\n    All day the tears down his wan cheeks, although\r\n    His father and his mother both were dead,\r\n    Nor even though his brother or his son\r\n    Had fallen in battle, and before his eyes.\r\n                           (Book IV. of the Odyssey, Lines 275–284.)\r\n\r\nIn former years and down almost to the present time, it was the custom\r\namong English medical writers to speak of Aesculapius only as the\r\n“God of Medicine,” thus conveying to the minds of many readers that\r\nhe was a mythological character, not a real personage. To-day, and\r\nespecially since Schliemann has demonstrated, by his excavations at\r\nthe site of ancient Troy, that Homer’s Iliad is not merely a beautiful\r\ncreation of his poetic fancy, but a narration of events that actually\r\noccurred about 1200 B. C., it is quite generally acknowledged that\r\nAesculapius[14] is an historical character, an individual whose memory\r\nshould receive due honor from the physicians of modern times. Neither\r\nHomer nor Pindar speaks of him as a god. In Athens he was publicly\r\ndeified in 420 B. C.\r\n\r\nWhen Daremberg, as quoted above, expressed the belief that Hippocrates\r\nwas the product of an earlier civilization, he undoubtedly gave due\r\nweight to other circumstances beside those which are narrated in\r\nHomer’s poems--circumstances, for example, which are referred to\r\ncasually by several of the classical Greek authors, and to which fresh\r\nimportance has been given by a number of recent discoveries. Thus,\r\nthere is an abundance of evidence showing that the Greeks, both before\r\nand after Homer’s time, held the memory of Aesculapius in the very\r\nhighest honor. So great, as they believed, was his power over disease,\r\nso wonderful were the cures which he accomplished, and so noble and\r\npure was his character, that they made him a god and erected temples\r\nin his honor--not mere places where a barren worship might be carried\r\non, but veritable sanatoria--termed Asclepieia--where the extraordinary\r\nhealing powers of him whom they had made a god might be perpetuated\r\nfor the benefit of succeeding generations. While, on the one hand,\r\nthe ancient Greeks may have been full of superstitious beliefs, they\r\nwere at the same time as kindly disposed toward their fellow men, as\r\ngenerous in their spending of money for this purpose, and as practical\r\nin their selection of suitable methods as are the benefactors of to-day\r\nall over the world. In course of time these so-called temples became\r\nthe prototypes of our hospitals, sanatoria and schools of medicine,\r\nand it therefore seems only proper that they should here be described\r\nsomewhat in detail.\r\n\r\n_The so-called Aesculapian Temples and their Chief Purpose._--The\r\nfirst of these temples, or Asclepieia, were established at Trikka, in\r\nThessaly; at Cnidus, on the coast of Caria in Asia Minor, opposite\r\nCos; at Epidaurus, in Argolis, Greece; at Cyrene on the northern\r\ncoast of Lybia, Africa, opposite the Island of Crete; at Crotona,\r\non the southeastern coast of Italy; and, finally, at Athens. It is\r\nsaid that traces of as many as eighty of these Asclepieia have been\r\nfound in different parts of the ancient world. One of them, for\r\nexample, is known to have existed on the small island (Isola San\r\nBartolommeo) in the Tiber, at Rome. Their management was intrusted, in\r\nthe earlier years of their existence, to men who were descendants of\r\nAesculapius--i.e., the sons and grandsons of Machaon and Podalirius.\r\nThey were both priests and physicians, and are mentioned in history as\r\nthe Asclepiadae. With the progress of time it became necessary, as one\r\nmay readily understand, to intrust the temple service to individuals\r\nwho were not members of the family of Aesculapius. The original\r\nAsclepiadae guarded as valuable secrets the methods of treatment and\r\nthe pharmaceutic formulae which had been handed down to them by the\r\nhead of the family. It was therefore natural, when these newly adopted\r\nmembers were installed in office, that they should be made to promise,\r\nunder oath, not to “divulge these secrets to any but their own sons,\r\nthe sons of their teachers, or the pupils who were preparing themselves\r\nto become regular physicians.” (Neuburger.)\r\n\r\nThe divulging of these secrets, it may be assumed, would gradually\r\nentail upon the organization of priest-physicians a serious money\r\nloss. As will be seen further on, the oath known as “the Hippocratic\r\nOath” omits these mercenary features, and thus places the vocation of\r\nphysician upon a much higher level.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, as noted by Hollaender, of Berlin, that\r\nHomer does not make the slightest mention of temples dedicated to\r\nAesculapius; from which circumstance it may be inferred that a long\r\ntime--perhaps several hundred years--elapsed, after his death, before\r\nhis countrymen realized fully his greatness and the value of the\r\nservices which he had rendered in his rôle of physician. Of the temples\r\nwhich were then built in his honor, all have long since fallen into\r\nruins, but in recent years excavations have been made at some of the\r\nmore important of these sites and under the guidance of competent\r\nscholars, and as a result our knowledge of the state of medicine in\r\nGreece between the time of Homer and the appearance of the Hippocratic\r\nwritings has been greatly enlarged. The facts revealed by these\r\nexcavations and the statements which are to be found in classical Greek\r\nliterature, but which previously did not receive all the consideration\r\nthat they deserved, have now been pieced together and we have thus\r\nbeen furnished with a fairly satisfactory picture of the relations of\r\nthe different chambers and spaces in these temples, and with a more or\r\nless complete account of the manner in which affairs were conducted by\r\nthose in charge. The following short description which is based on the\r\naccount recently published by Professor Meyer-Steineg of Jena, Germany,\r\nwill put the reader in possession of all the more important facts.[15]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 1. VIEW OF THE TEMPLE OF AESCULAPIUS ON THE\r\n  ISLAND OF COS.\r\n\r\n  As it must have appeared to the traveler, in the third century\r\n  B. C., on his approach by sea to the port of that island.\r\n\r\n  Reconstitution based upon recent photographs and upon surveys by\r\n  Herzog (_Koische Forschungen_, 1904).\r\n\r\n  (Courtesy of Prof. Dr. Meyer-Steineg, of Jena, Germany.)]\r\n\r\nThere were two principal types of Asclepieia--one, like that of\r\nEpidaurus, in Argolis, which occupied an inland situation, that had\r\nclearly been chosen from religious motives alone, viz., because it was\r\nbelieved, in accordance with an ancient tradition, that at this spot\r\nAesculapius had been born--and a second, like that of Cos, on the\r\nisland of the same name in the Aegean Sea, which situation without\r\ndoubt had been chosen chiefly because the locality was exceptionally\r\nhealthful. Of the first of these two types of temples, the sites of\r\nboth of which have been most carefully studied, very little need\r\nbe said in this brief sketch. The purely medical aspects of this\r\nAsclepieion, to which at the height of its celebrity crowds flocked\r\nfrom all parts of Greece, are of minor interest. The temple and its\r\naccessory buildings, which appear to have been very extensive, were\r\nlocated in a narrow valley, not far distant from the seaside village\r\nwhich still to-day bears the name of Epidaurus. Then, also, the\r\nlocality is deficient in one important respect--it has an insufficient\r\nsupply of good drinking water; and, finally, it is only slightly\r\nelevated above the sea-level. Dr. Meyer-Steineg remarks that the\r\npatients who visited this temple must have owed whatever benefit they\r\nderived from the visit to other influences than those of a purely\r\nmedical or hygienic character. Doubtless suggestion played an important\r\npart in any relief which they may have obtained, and the so-called\r\ntemple-sleep was also doubtless a very effective factor in this\r\ndirection. The Asclepieion at Cos, on the other hand, occupied a most\r\nhealthful position on the northern slope of the ridge of mountains\r\nwhich extends throughout the entire length of the island and attains a\r\nmaximum height of about 3000 feet. (See Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to describe, as best I may within the limited\r\nspace which is at my command, the results of the excavations and\r\nsurveys that have been made in recent years on the Island of Cos.\r\nProfessor Meyer-Steineg’s article on this subject[16] is the source\r\nfrom which I have derived the information contained in the following\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nThe temple and its associated buildings stood at an elevation of\r\nthree hundred feet above the sea-level and at a distance of a little\r\nmore than two miles from the city of Cos. The heights behind the\r\ntemple were in former times covered with forests and afforded ample\r\nprotection against the debilitating and much-dreaded south wind. A\r\nbrook of considerable size and of very pure water passed through the\r\ntemple grounds; the spring (Burinna) from which it took its origin\r\nbeing located about 300 feet higher up on the side of the mountain.\r\nNot far off, in the same neighborhood, is a mineral spring, the water\r\nfrom which contains both iron and sulphur. All the physical conditions\r\nof this site were, therefore, very favorable to the restoration of\r\nboth mental and bodily health. Professor Meyer-Steineg declares that\r\nit is scarcely possible to determine accurately the age of the Cos\r\nAsclepieion,--_i.e._, of the structures which the present ruins\r\nrepresent,--but he believes that some of them date no farther back than\r\nthe third century B. C., at which time extensive structural alterations\r\nwere made.[17] Then, at a still later date (first century A. D.), in\r\nconsequence of the damage done by an earthquake, C. Stertinius Xenophon\r\n(at the instigation of the Roman Emperor Claudius, whose private\r\nphysician he was) carried out some very radical changes. Not only were\r\nthe separate buildings well supplied with running water, but even many\r\nof the individual rooms (of which there were a large number) were\r\nequipped with the same conveniences. Hydropathy evidently formed an\r\nimportant part of the treatment in the reconstructed temple. (See Fig.\r\n2.)\r\n\r\nAs has been shown above, the climate, the freedom from disturbing\r\nfactors of all kinds, the existence at that spot of a plentiful supply\r\nof pure water, the character of the structures composing the temple\r\ngroup, and the widespread belief among the people that the Asclepiadae\r\nwere able, with the assistance of the god Aesculapius, to effect cures\r\nwhich were obtainable nowhere else--all contributed to make the temple\r\nat Cos one of the greatest sanatoria of ancient times.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 2. BIRD’S-EYE VIEW OF THE TEMPLE OF AESCULAPIUS\r\n  AND ASSOCIATED BUILDINGS ON THE ISLAND OF COS.\r\n\r\n  As they appeared in the third century B. C.\r\n\r\n  (Copied by permission from a model made by Prof. Dr.\r\n  Meyer-Steineg for the Medico-historical Museum of the University\r\n  of Jena, Germany.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 3. GROUND PLAN OF THE ASCLEPIEION ON THE ISLAND\r\n  OF COS.\r\n\r\n  As Ascertained by the Researches of Dr. Herzog.\r\n\r\n  The different structures are arranged as nearly as possible in\r\n  the same positions which they occupied in the third century, B.\r\n  C.\r\n\r\n  _A_, main entrance to Asclepieion; _B_, _B_,\r\n  _B_, gallery, 6 metres broad, with colonnade on one side;\r\n  _C_, open space or court, on the southern side of which is\r\n  a structure composed of recesses provided each with a bathing\r\n  basin (_D_); _H_, staircase leading to intermediate\r\n  terrace; _a_, massive series of steps leading to the upper\r\n  terrace; _b_, _b_, _b_, broad gallery similar to\r\n  that shown on the lower terrace; _d_, the temple proper.\r\n\r\n  (From Prof. Dr. Meyer-Steineg’s _Medizinisch-historische\r\n  Beiträge_.)]\r\n\r\nThe buildings which constituted what is commonly termed the “Temple\r\nof Aesculapius” at Cos were located on three artificially prepared\r\nterraces. The principal entrance to the group, as the excavations\r\nconducted quite recently by Herzog show, was on the lower terrace,\r\nand faced north--that is, toward the sea. From this lower level a\r\nbroad staircase led to the second or intermediate terrace, which, in\r\nturn, was connected with the upper one by means of a very broad and\r\nmassive series of steps. The southern limit of this upper terrace\r\nended abruptly at the slope of the mountain. The arrangement of the\r\nbuildings on the three different terraces may, in harmony with the\r\naccount given by Professor Meyer-Steineg, be briefly described as\r\nfollows: That which stood on the lower terrace occupied three sides\r\nof a parallelogram (Fig. 3), the open part of which faced south. The\r\nlonger side of the building measured about 120 metres (390 feet) in\r\nlength, and the two shorter sides each 55 metres (180 feet). The\r\nsupply of running water in every part of this great building, which\r\nappears to have been devoted mainly, if not entirely, to therapeutic\r\npurposes, must have been most abundant. The source from which the\r\nwater came was the Burinna spring, situated higher up on the mountain\r\nat a spot far beyond all possibility of contamination. It is not yet\r\nclear, says Dr. Meyer-Steineg, whether or not there were any buildings\r\ndevoted to therapeutic purposes on the intermediate terrace. (Figs.\r\n2 and 3.) On the other hand, the great halls, contained in the large\r\nbuilding which surrounded the temple on the upper terrace, appear to\r\ncorrespond very closely to the rooms that constituted the main portion\r\nof the building on the lower terrace, and it is therefore probable that\r\nthis upper building also served some useful purpose in the general\r\nscheme of the Asclepieion. It is Herzog’s opinion--according to\r\nMeyer-Steineg--that the central idea around which everything in this\r\nassemblage of fine buildings revolved, was a clinic conducted by the\r\nAsclepiadae. The means chiefly employed at first for the restoration\r\nof health were such simple agents as sunlight, pure air, pure drinking\r\nwater, dietetic measures, massage, physical exercise, etc., and yet,\r\nwhen the patient’s condition seemed to require their use, there was no\r\nhesitation in resorting to the rational employment of drugs, and even\r\nsurgical operations were performed. The numerous instruments which Dr.\r\nMeyer-Steineg collected at the site of the ruins when he visited Cos in\r\n1910, furnish ample corroborative evidence of the correctness of this\r\nlast statement.\r\n\r\nNot the least important part which this famous Asclepieion played in\r\nthe history of medicine was the splendid opportunity which it afforded\r\nto those who were preparing themselves to engage in the practice of\r\nthe healing art, for acquiring the necessary familiarity with the\r\ndifferent diseases and for learning how they should be treated.\r\n\r\nThe manner of conducting the preliminary treatment was probably not\r\nthe same in every particular in all the different Asclepieia, and yet\r\nin the main the plan of procedure followed in Epidaurus, in Cos and in\r\nAthens undoubtedly resembled closely that which Pagel furnishes in his\r\n_Geschichte der Medizin_. It may be briefly described as follows:--\r\n\r\nIn the first place, moribund persons, the unclean, and women about to\r\nbe confined were not admitted into the temple enclosure. The management\r\nof the latter class of patients was left entirely to women nurses, and,\r\nwhen it became evident that a person was likely to die, the individual\r\nwas thereafter cared for outside the enclosure.[18] In short,\r\neverything possible was done to keep out of sight all such objects as\r\nmight produce an unpleasant impression upon applicants for treatment.\r\nAfter preliminary bathing and dieting, the patient was conducted into\r\nthe temple enclosure and encouraged to make offerings and to pray to\r\nthe god Aesculapius, an imposing statue of whom in marble was one of\r\nthe first things that confronted him. As he was led about by the priest\r\nor an attendant, his imagination was wrought upon by the sight of\r\nnumerous votive offerings exposed to view on the walls or columns of\r\nthe buildings, by the singing of hymns in adoration of the god, and by\r\nthe reading of the records of earlier cases inscribed on tablets or on\r\nthe columns. After his mind had thus been worked upon, he was asked to\r\nfurnish to the priest a detailed history of his own case and to submit\r\nto some sort of physical examination. As a final and most important\r\nstep in this first stage of the treatment he was subjected to what was\r\ntermed “the temple-sleep,” during which the suggestion of the proper\r\nremedies to be employed was supposed to be communicated to him by the\r\ngod himself.\r\n\r\nIn our day it is difficult to understand how persons of a fair degree\r\nof intelligence could for so long a period have continued to believe\r\nin the efficacious interference of the deified Aesculapius in their\r\nbehalf. But that this belief really did exist is well known, and it was\r\nonly after the lapse of many centuries that the faith of the public\r\nbegan to weaken, doubtless through the influence of several factors.\r\nPerhaps the most important of these was the discovery of an increasing\r\nnumber of instances of humbuggery or trickery, of which the officiating\r\npriests, in some of the temples, had been guilty. The satirical writer,\r\nAristophanes, who flourished in Athens about 400 B. C., describes an\r\nincident of this nature in his play entitled “Ploutos.” The following\r\nextracts furnish an account of the doings observed by the slave Karion\r\non the occasion of his passing a night in the temple enclosure at\r\nAthens:--\r\n\r\n    The Scene throughout is laid at Athens, in front of the\r\n    house of Chremulos.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _Blepsidemos_: Ought n’t we then to bring in some doctor?\r\n\r\n   _Chremulos_: Prythee, what doctor is there now in the city?\r\n   For their pay is no longer anything worth, nor their art.\r\n\r\n   _Blep._: Let us cast about.\r\n\r\n   _Chrem._: Nay, there is not one.\r\n\r\n   _Blep._: I believe there is not.\r\n\r\n   _Chrem._: Nay, by Zeus, the best plan is to do what I have\r\n   been long preparing--(to conduct him [Ploutos]) to the temple of\r\n   Asklepios [and] make him lie down [there].\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _Chrem._: Karion, my man, you must bring out the bedclothes\r\n   and lead Ploutos himself in the usual way, and carry everything\r\n   else that is ready within.\r\n\r\n    (_Exeunt omnes._)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _Chorus of Farmers._ What is the matter, Oh thou best\r\n   friend of--thyself? For you seem to have come as a messenger of\r\n   some good news.\r\n\r\n   _Karion._[19] My master has fared most prosperously, or\r\n   rather Ploutos himself. For, instead of being a blind man, he\r\n   has been made to see again, and his pupils are clear-sighted, as\r\n   he has met with a kindly friend in Asklepios the Healer.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus._ You give me reason for joy, reason for shouts of\r\n   triumph.\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Ye have reason to rejoice whether ye wish it or\r\n   not.\r\n\r\n   _Chorus._ I will shout aloud for Asklepios of the goodly\r\n   children, the great light to mortals.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Well, as soon as ever we came to the god,\r\n   leading a man then, indeed, most miserable, but now blessed and\r\n   fortunate, if any other is so, first we led him to the sea, and\r\n   then we bathed him.\r\n\r\n   _Wife of Chremulos._ By Zeus, then the old man was\r\n   fortunate, bathing in the cold sea.\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Then we went to the sacred enclosure of the god.\r\n   And when on the altar the cakes and offerings were dedicated\r\n   by the flame of murky Hephaistos, we laid down Ploutos, as was\r\n   proper; and each of us made up from little odds and ends a bed\r\n   for himself.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ Then were there certain others beside yourselves\r\n   wanting the god?\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Yes, Neokleides, for one, and he is blind; but\r\n   in stealing has far overshot those who can see; and there were\r\n   many others with all sorts of ailments. But when the minister of\r\n   the deity put out the lights and told us to go to sleep and said\r\n   that we were to keep silent, if any of us perceived a noise, we\r\n   all lay down in an orderly manner. And I was unable to sleep,\r\n   for my attention was arrested by a certain pitcher of porridge\r\n   a little way off from the head of a certain old woman, and I\r\n   strangely desired to creep over to that pitcher. Then I looked\r\n   up and saw the priest making a clean sweep of the cakes and\r\n   dried figs from the sacred table. After this he went round all\r\n   the altars in a circle to see if any cakes were left anywhere.\r\n   Then he consecrated them into a certain wallet; and I, believing\r\n   that there was great holiness in this proceeding, rise up to go\r\n   to the pitcher of porridge.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ Oh you most miserable of men, were you not afraid\r\n   of the god?\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Yes; by the gods I was afraid lest he with his\r\n   fillets should reach the pitcher before me; for the priest\r\n   had already given me a lesson. But, as soon as ever the old\r\n   woman perceived the noise I made, she lifted up her hand over\r\n   the pitcher (to protect it). Then I hissed and seized (her\r\n   hand) by the teeth as if I were a reddish-brown snake. But\r\n   she at once drew back her hand again and lay down peacefully,\r\n   rolling herself up. And then I at once gulped down a lot of the\r\n   porridge; and then, when I was full, I jumped up again.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ And didn’t the god come up to you?\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Not up to that time. After this I at once\r\n   covered myself up, being afraid; but he made a complete circuit\r\n   examining all the ailments in a most orderly fashion; and then a\r\n   slave set by him a little mortar and box of stone.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ Of stone?\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ No, by Zeus, certainly not,--at least, not the\r\n   box.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ To the deuce with you, how did you see since you\r\n   say you were covered up?\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ Through my old cloak; for, by Zeus, it had holes\r\n   not a few. First of all, he took in hand to pound a plaster\r\n   for Neokleides, and he threw in three cloves of Tenian garlic.\r\n   Then he bruised them in the mortar, mixing therewith the acid\r\n   juice of the fig-tree and squill; then, having diluted it with\r\n   Sphettian vinegar, he turned his eyelids inside out that he\r\n   might feel more pain, and then applied the mixture. But he,\r\n   squalling and bawling, jumped up and was running away, when the\r\n   god said with a laugh:--“Sit down there now, smeared with thy\r\n   plaster, that I may stop thee from going to the Assembly, having\r\n   for once a real excuse.”\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ What a patriot and sage the god is!\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ After that he sat down by the side of Ploutos,\r\n   and first he touched his head, and then, taking a clean towel,\r\n   he wiped his eyelids all round, and Panakeia covered his head\r\n   and all his face with a cloth of purple dye; and the god then\r\n   whistled. Thereupon two snakes of monstrous size darted forth\r\n   from the temple.\r\n\r\n   _Wife._ Dear Gods!\r\n\r\n   _Karion._ And these two (snakes) having quietly glided\r\n   under the crimson cloth, licked his eyelids all around,\r\n   methought. And before you could drink ten cups of wine, my\r\n   mistress, Ploutos stood up and was able to see: and I clapped\r\n   my hands with delight and awoke my master. And the god suddenly\r\n   took himself off from our view with the snakes into the temple.\r\n\r\nIf one examines carefully the facts connected with the Aesculapian\r\ntemple treatment, so far as they are known to us, one cannot fail\r\nto be impressed with their strong resemblance to what has been the\r\nexperience of similar semi-religious movements in more recent times,\r\nnot only in European countries but also in the United States. In all\r\nof them there may be found a kernel of true religious belief, and no\r\ncandid observer can deny the fact that many persons have been benefited\r\nthereby both in body and in mind. But, sooner or later, the method\r\nhas fallen into disrepute, either because it was employed in the vain\r\nhope that it might accomplish a cure which surgical means alone could\r\neffect, or else because unscrupulous persons, taking advantage of the\r\ncredulousness of those associated with the movement, utilized it for\r\ntheir own selfish advantage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n       THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SERPENT IN THE STATUES AND VOTIVE\r\n         OFFERINGS EXPOSED TO VIEW IN THE AESCULAPIAN TEMPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every important gallery of sculpture in Europe possesses at\r\nleast one marble statue of Aesculapius, and in the majority of these\r\nthe god is represented as a middle-aged or elderly man of powerful\r\nframe, having a full head of hair and full beard, and clothed only\r\nwith the pallium or mantle, which is so placed as to leave the right\r\nshoulder and a large part of the chest uncovered. He holds in his\r\nright hand a knotted staff around which, in many of the statues, is\r\ncoiled a serpent whose head approaches very closely to the hand. The\r\nexpression of the god’s countenance is strikingly peaceful and serene,\r\nyet without any evidence of weakness. In not a few instances other\r\nanimals are represented alongside the statue, usually at the god’s\r\nfeet--as, for example, the cock, the owl, the eagle, the hawk or the\r\nram--and occasionally his daughter Hygieia is shown at his side feeding\r\nthe serpent. The cock is the symbol of watchfulness--a physician should\r\nbe vigilant; the owl symbolizes his need of clear-sightedness and of\r\nreadiness to care for his patients in the night as well as during the\r\nday; the eagle has a penetrating eye and it is the emblem of long\r\nlife--a benefit which the healing art is capable of procuring; the hawk\r\nwas the bird consecrated to Isis, Queen of Egypt, who was believed by\r\nthe Egyptians to have been highly skilled in medicine; and the ram\r\nis the symbol of dreams and divination. Pliny says that the patients\r\nwho were brought to the temple of Aesculapius were made to lie down\r\nat night wrapped in the skin of a ram, in order that they might\r\nhave divine dreams. The presence of the serpent in nearly all of the\r\nstatues of Aesculapius is explained in a variety of ways. Some say\r\nthat this reptile, which sheds his skin once a year, is emblematic of\r\nthe sick person’s need to acquire a new body, or at least cast off\r\nhis old skin in the same manner as does the snake. Others consider\r\nthe serpent as merely the symbol of wisdom, as it is admittedly the\r\nshrewdest and most cunning of all animals. In a few instances it is\r\nrepresented as drinking from a receptacle held in the hand of Hygieia.\r\nPerhaps the sculptor’s intention here was to show that the serpent,\r\nalthough the wisest of all animals, believed that he might add to\r\nhis stock of wisdom by drinking from the fountain under the control\r\nof Aesculapius, thus conveying the impression that the wisdom of the\r\nlatter was greater than his own. But all these interpretations are too\r\nsubtle for the uneducated mind to appreciate at a glance. They fail\r\nalso to satisfy our preconceived ideas of what such a statue should\r\nbe--viz., a memorial of the godlike character of Aesculapius and of\r\nthe priceless benefits which he conferred upon his fellow men, and,\r\nat the same time, an object which, when first contemplated by one\r\nwho is ill, would at once evoke in that person feelings of perfect\r\nconfidence in the ability and the willingness of the god represented\r\nby the statue to effect a cure. Some, perhaps even a majority, of the\r\nstatues thus far recovered from the ruins of the different Aesculapian\r\ntemples certainly fail to arouse any such sentiments in the minds of\r\nordinary observers; but there are others which do in some measure\r\naccomplish this, and among the number the statue which may be seen in\r\nthe Berlin Museum and of which a photographic copy (Fig. 4) is here\r\nreproduced, should certainly be included. The head of the god is less\r\nimposing and the expression less kindly than are these features in\r\nsome of the other statues (see, for example, Fig. 5), but, to offset\r\nthis, the serpent represented in the latter is of the non-poisonous\r\nvariety.[20] The addition of such a harmless creature to the figure\r\nrepresenting the god contributes nothing to the power of the statue\r\nas a whole to impress the people--_i.e._, the uneducated masses,\r\nas, for example, the peasants, etc. On the other hand, the significance\r\nof the poisonous snake in a statue of this character will be readily\r\nappreciated if one considers the fact that in ancient times, as it is\r\neven to-day in India, the loss of life caused by the bites of poisonous\r\nsnakes was enormous. In the presence of such a fact, therefore, it\r\nwould be difficult for a sculptor who was desirous of emphasizing\r\nthe extraordinary healing powers of his hero to accomplish this\r\nmore effectively than by embodying in his statue, along with other\r\nimpressive features, such characters as would show him to have gained\r\nthe mastery over that terribly fatal malady--the bite of the viper\r\nand of the still more deadly serpents of India and parts of Africa.\r\nAlthough we possess no facts which would warrant the statement that\r\nAesculapius had been particularly successful in the treatment of this\r\nform of poisoning, these temple statues furnish indirect proof of a\r\nstrong character that his healing power in this direction had been\r\nvery great,--so great, indeed, as to have been largely instrumental\r\nin winning for him the appellation of a god. Such a striking object,\r\nespecially when its more important features were commented upon by\r\nthe priest who accompanied the patient on his or her first tour of\r\ninspection of temple wonders, could scarcely have failed to produce a\r\nvery deep impression upon the imagination.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 4. ANCIENT STATUE OF THE GOD AESCULAPIUS IN THE\r\n  BERLIN MUSEUM.\r\n\r\n  (From Holländer’s _Plastik und Medizin_, with the author’s\r\n  permission.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 5.\r\n\r\n  HEAD OF THE MARBLE STATUE OF THE GOD AESCULAPIUS IN THE NAPLES\r\n  MUSEUM.]\r\n\r\nIn the illustration which has here been reproduced (Fig. 4), a viper,\r\nas clearly shown by the shape of his head and neck and by the unusual\r\nlength of the jaw, has twined himself about the staff and is close\r\nto the god’s hand, so close that in an instant’s time the fatal bite\r\nmight readily be inflicted. But Aesculapius shows by his countenance,\r\nby the unconcerned manner in which he allows his right hand to remain\r\nnear the serpent’s head, and by the easy pose of his whole body, that\r\nhe is not at all concerned about the danger which appears to threaten\r\nhis life. In the estimation of the ancient Greeks this fearlessness was\r\nundoubtedly attributed to the supernatural power which they believed\r\nAesculapius to possess over dangerous serpents as well as over diseases\r\nof all kinds.\r\n\r\nSo far as now appears, all the statues of the god that have been dug\r\nup in Greece or its nearest colonies represent the serpent as of\r\nthe size commonly observed in that part of the world. Hollaender,\r\nhowever, furnishes (on page 118 of his work) an illustration which\r\nrepresents--as he believes--the god Aesculapius in the presence of\r\nan enormous snake, evidently a python. (Fig. 6.) As this variety of\r\nserpent is not to be found in Greece, or indeed at any point further\r\nnorth than the Mediterranean coast of Africa, it is fair to assume\r\nthat the bas-relief which depicts this scene must have been made for\r\nexhibition in an Asclepieion located at Cyrene or at the relatively\r\nnear city of Alexandria, where patients, who were more or less familiar\r\nwith this serpent and realized its power of crushing people to death,\r\nwould have occasion to witness this suggestive work of art. And,\r\nfurthermore, as if it were for the express purpose of emphasizing the\r\ngreat protective power of the god, the sculptor has introduced, on one\r\nside of the scene, the figures of three women, two young children and\r\na lamb. The women nearest to the monster have folded their arms and do\r\nnot manifest the least sign of fear. The children also appear to be\r\nunaware of the presence of a deadly danger. In short, the proximity of\r\nthe god Aesculapius has instilled into the minds of these human beings\r\nthe most complete sense of fearlessness; he himself, as in the case\r\nof the statue of Aesculapius shown in Fig. 4, exhibiting a complete\r\nabsence of fear in the presence of the dangerous monster. Neither death\r\nby poisoning nor death by constriction has any terrors for him to whom\r\nthe patient is about to appeal for relief from disease.\r\n\r\nThat pythons were a terror in former times to the people who inhabited\r\nthe coast regions near Cyrene is evident from a statement which\r\nAristotle makes in his History of Animals (Book VIII., Chapter\r\nxxviii.). It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   In Libya (Africa) the serpents, as has been already remarked,\r\n   are very large. For some persons say that, as they sailed along\r\n   the coast, they saw the bones of many oxen, and that it was\r\n   evident to them that they had been devoured by the serpents.\r\n   And, as the ships passed on, the serpents attacked the triremes,\r\n   and some of them threw themselves upon one of the triremes and\r\n   overturned it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n       THE BEGINNINGS OF A RATIONAL SYSTEM OF MEDICINE IN GREECE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the lapse of time the religious and mystical features of the\r\ntreatment carried on at the Asclepieia gave place, more and more,\r\nto rational methods, and eventually--it is scarcely possible to\r\nmention a date, but probably not many years before the Hippocratic\r\nperiod--these institutions became centres for the spread of medical\r\nknowledge of the most practical kind. This is particularly true of the\r\nAsclepieion at Cos, where Hippocrates is believed to have received\r\nhis medical training. It is interesting to note that the mystical\r\nfeatures of the temple treatment--features which certainly did not\r\noriginate with Aesculapius himself or with his sons, Machaon and\r\nPodalirius--eventually proved powerless to stay the slow but sure\r\nadvance of sound medical knowledge. Even during the period when these\r\nfalse elements seemed to be most strongly rooted in the temple methods,\r\nthere were forces at work which in due time deprived them of much of\r\ntheir pernicious power. This result was inevitable, for an organization\r\nwhich, in order to prosper in its work of doing good to humanity,\r\ndepended upon the natural superstitiousness of the people, could not\r\npossibly thrive for an indefinite length of time. That the evil results\r\ndid not develop sooner than they did simply shows how powerful and\r\nstubborn is the force of superstition. In the absence of trustworthy\r\nhistorical evidence, hypothetical statements only can be brought\r\nforward, but there can scarcely be any doubt but that a genuine belief\r\nin the power of Aesculapius (deified) to cure disease and restore\r\nhealth persisted for centuries.\r\n\r\nThe custom of recording the case histories on tablets or on the\r\ncolumns of the temple,--for at this period writing was in general\r\nuse,--and also that of dedicating to the god images which represented\r\n(sometimes with a remarkable degree of truthfulness) the pathological\r\ncondition for which the patient sought relief, contributed very greatly\r\nto the substitution of sound learning for religious mysticism and\r\npoorly concealed humbuggery.\r\n\r\nAmong the interesting objects which may be seen at the Museum of the\r\nHistory of Medicine in Jena, Germany, there are several of these\r\nterra-cotta images (votive offerings) representing pathological\r\nconditions; and among them the writer noticed more particularly one\r\nwhich reproduced faithfully, though in diminutive size, the appearances\r\npresented by cancer of the female breast. (Fig. 7.) There were also a\r\nvery carefully modeled statuette of the trunk of a woman affected with\r\nascites, and an admirable representation of a case of facial paralysis.\r\n(Fig. 8.) These objects were obtained by Professor Meyer-Steineg on the\r\noccasion of a recent visit to the ruins of the temple of Cos and other\r\nsimilar ruins in Greece and Asia Minor. The British Museum possesses\r\nmany objects of the same character.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 6. BAS-RELIEF OF AESCULAPIUS, ACCOMPANIED BY\r\n  WOMEN AND CHILDREN, IN THE PRESENCE OF AN ENORMOUS SERPENT.\r\n\r\n  The original is in the National Museum at Athens.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 7. FEMALE BUST SHOWING CANCER OF ONE BREAST.\r\n\r\n  (Courtesy of Prof. Dr. Meyer-Steineg, of Jena, Germany.)]\r\n\r\nIt is not known at what precise date the _iatreia_, or small\r\nprivate hospitals, first made their appearance, but it was about the\r\ntime when the religious character of the therapeutic work done in\r\nthe Asclepieia gave place to treatment of a more distinctly medical\r\ncharacter. Then, in addition to these _iatreia_, there were\r\nschools for gladiators and institutions in which gymnastic exercises\r\nwere zealously cultivated; and in these places there was a frequent\r\ndemand for advice in regard to questions of diet, and for surgical\r\naid in the setting of broken bones, the reducing of dislocations,\r\nand the curing of bruises and sprains. As may readily be understood,\r\nthe Asclepieia could not furnish the sort of professional aid which\r\nthese institutions needed, and thus a further stimulus was given to\r\nthe complete separation of the two kinds of medical practice--that\r\nconnected with the temple and that conducted by outside physicians.\r\n\r\nIn Plato’s “Republic” (Book III., Chapter 15) mention is made of a\r\ncertain Herodicus (of Selymbria; about 450 B. C.) who effected many\r\ncures by a method of treatment which combined athletic exercises\r\nwith dieting. He gained considerable celebrity in this way, and is\r\nundoubtedly entitled to the credit of having been the first to call\r\nserious attention to the value of this plan of treating certain\r\nmaladies. But, unfortunately, he made use of it in not a few instances\r\nwhere it proved harmful rather than beneficial to the patient, and thus\r\nbrought discredit upon the method.\r\n\r\nAlready previous to the time at which the changes mentioned above\r\ntook place, there had occurred still other changes in the character\r\nand practice of medicine. The business of cutting for stone in the\r\nbladder, for example, had been left entirely in the hands of men who\r\nmade a specialty of this branch of medicine--men who might truthfully\r\nbe called medical artisans. Then there was another class of men who\r\ndevoted their energies to collecting medicinal roots and plants.\r\nThey were a necessity to physicians, and constituted the first\r\nrepresentatives of the modern apothecary. Still another change in the\r\nstatus of the Greek physicians had been slowly developing throughout\r\nthis pre-Hippocratic period, a change which tended more and more to\r\nmake them men of self-reliance and of considerable importance in their\r\nrespective communities, and which indicated very clearly that they were\r\nsteadily growing in skill and breadth of knowledge. As evidence of the\r\ncorrectness of this statement it is sufficient to mention the fact that\r\nGreek physicians had established so good a reputation that they were\r\nfrequently called to see important cases at a great distance--in Egypt,\r\nin Persia, etc. But before further consideration is given to this\r\nsubject of the development of the Greek physician during the period\r\nimmediately preceding the appearance of the Hippocratic writings,\r\nit seems advisable to say a few words concerning the facilities for\r\nmedical instruction which were available at that time.\r\n\r\n_Medical Instruction in Connection with the Asclepieia._--\r\nIt does not appear clearly in any of the published descriptions\r\nof these ancient Greek sanatoria just what were the relations\r\nbetween the priests and the men who utilized all this rich clinical\r\nmaterial--records of all sorts of diseases, and the means (other\r\nthan religious) employed in treating them, pictures or plastic\r\nreproductions of the visible pathological lesions, etc.--for the\r\npurpose of instructing the younger men who contemplated engaging in the\r\npractice of medicine. The modern teachers of the art know very well how\r\ndifficult is the task of combining in a satisfactory manner these two\r\nthings--the safeguarding of the patient’s interests and the utilization\r\nof their maladies as object lessons for men who are preparing to cure\r\nor relieve the bodily ills of those who may at some future moment need\r\ntheir professional services. To them, therefore, it would be a matter\r\nof very great interest to learn how this difficult problem had been\r\nsolved nearly twenty-five hundred years ago. But, unfortunately, no\r\nsatisfactory data upon which a trustworthy account might be founded\r\nare obtainable, and we are obliged to fall back upon such aid as our\r\nimagination may furnish. From Puschmann’s work on medical teaching in\r\nancient times the following statement relating to the subject has been\r\ntaken:--\r\n\r\n   The priests in the Aesculapian temples were not, as is generally\r\n   assumed, physicians in the ordinary sense. They may have\r\n   acquired some knowledge of the art, and they may even in some\r\n   instances have been regularly trained physicians, but the\r\n   important fact remains that they wished it to be understood that\r\n   the treatment carried out in the temple was in accordance with\r\n   revelations made to them by the god Aesculapius, and not the\r\n   mere fruit of human knowledge. Consequently the intervention\r\n   of regular physicians in the temple management of the sick\r\n   must have appeared to them quite superfluous. For this reason,\r\n   therefore, it is not likely that there existed, on the part of\r\n   either the temple priests or the physicians, any feeling of\r\n   animosity or opposition. It is more likely that the contrary\r\n   was the case, for the evidence shows that the physicians--the\r\n   Asclepiadae--paid most humble reverence to the sacred relics\r\n   of Aesculapius, and placed the most implicit confidence in the\r\n   opinions which he was supposed to give in desperate cases.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 8. PARALYSIS OF THE LEFT FACIAL NERVE.\r\n\r\n  (Courtesy of Prof. Dr. Meyer-Steineg, _Jenaer\r\n  medizinisch-historische Beiträge_, Heft 2, 1912.)]\r\n\r\nWhile Puschmann does not say to what period in the history of these\r\ntemples his statement applies, it is safe to assume that he had in\r\nmind only the earlier stages. When the systematic teachings of medical\r\npupils began, those physicians who gave the instruction--viz., the\r\nAsclepiadae who were not at the same time priests--took up their abode\r\nsomewhere in the neighborhood of the temple. Thus, medical schools were\r\nformed at different places, those of Rhodes, Crotone, Cyrene, Cos and\r\nCnidus attaining the greatest celebrity. The pupil paid a fee for his\r\ninstruction, and when his training was believed to be completed he was\r\nadmitted into the association or brotherhood of the Asclepiadae upon\r\ntaking the following oath, which for ages past has been known as “The\r\nHippocratic Oath,” but which is now believed to have been formulated\r\nlong before the time of Hippocrates:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH\r\n\r\n   I swear by Apollo the Physician and Aesculapius, and Hygieia and\r\n   Panacea and all the gods and all the goddesses--and I make them\r\n   my judges--that this mine oath and this my written engagement I\r\n   will fulfil as far as power and discernment shall be mine.\r\n\r\n   Him who taught me this art I will esteem even as I do my\r\n   parents; he shall partake of my livelihood, and, if in want,\r\n   shall share my goods. I will regard his issue as my brothers and\r\n   will teach them this art without fee or written engagement if\r\n   they shall wish to learn it.\r\n\r\n   I will give instruction by precept, by discourse, and in all\r\n   other ways, to my own sons, to those of him who taught me, to\r\n   disciples bound by written engagements and sworn according to\r\n   medical law, and to no other person.\r\n\r\n   So far as power and discernment shall be mine, I will carry out\r\n   regimen for the benefit of the sick and will keep them from harm\r\n   and wrong. To none will I give a deadly drug even if solicited,\r\n   nor offer counsel to such an end; likewise to no woman will I\r\n   give a destructive suppository; but guiltless and hallowed will\r\n   I keep my life and mine art. I will cut no one whatever for the\r\n   stone, but will give way to those who work at this practice.\r\n\r\n   Into whatsoever houses I shall enter I will go for the benefit\r\n   of the sick, holding aloof from all voluntary wrong and\r\n   corruption, including venereal acts upon the bodies of females\r\n   and males whether free or slaves. Whatsoever in my practice or\r\n   not in my practice I shall see or hear amid the lives of men\r\n   which ought not to be noised abroad--as to this I will keep\r\n   silence, holding such things unfitting to be spoken.\r\n\r\n   And now if I shall fulfil this oath and break it not, may the\r\n   fruits of life and of art be mine, may I be honored of all men\r\n   for all time; the opposite if I shall transgress and be forsworn.\r\n\r\n   (Translated from the Greek by the late John G. Curtis, M.D., of\r\n   New York.)\r\n\r\nWhile at first, according to Puschmann, many physicians did not belong\r\nto the Aesculapian Brotherhood, there came a time when all were known\r\nas Asclepiadae.\r\n\r\n_Influence of the Schools of Philosophy on the Growth of Medical\r\nKnowledge._--About the beginning of the sixth century B. C. there\r\ndeveloped, in Greece and its colonies, schools of philosophy which\r\nexerted a most excellent influence upon the growth of medicine. The\r\nfirst of these was the one known as the Ionian School, whose founders\r\nand chief representatives were Thales, of Miletus in Ionia (born in\r\n640, died in 548 B. C.), and his pupils Anaximander and Anaximenes.\r\nThe guiding principle of these men was to study natural phenomena and\r\nto learn, if possible, their causes and the laws of their action.\r\nPhysiology, therefore, became one of their special studies, and\r\nthus they contributed to the laying of one of the most important\r\nfoundation-stones of medicine. Thanks to the good quality of the work\r\nof instruction that had thus far been carried on at Cos, Cnidus, and\r\nother Asclepieia, medicine had by this time reached a sufficient\r\ndegree of development for its devotees to derive a full measure of\r\nbenefit from the new teaching of the philosophers. Well grounded in the\r\nobservation of disease in its different forms and modes of behavior,\r\nand also familiarized with the ordinary methods of treatment, these\r\nphysicians needed to be shown a new route along which they might\r\nadvance to greater heights of knowledge, and they also needed to be\r\nstimulated to further endeavor. The introduction of the new school\r\naccomplished both of these purposes. It taught the men of the older\r\norganizations that they must make much greater use of their reasoning\r\npowers than they had hitherto done, and at the same time, through\r\nthe creation of a group of rival physicians, it supplied them with\r\nthe required stimulus. Another important school of philosophy was\r\nthat known as the Eleatic School, which flourished at Elea, in Lower\r\nItaly, its leaders being natives of that city. The most prominent men\r\nconnected with this school were Parmenides (born about 540 B. C.) and\r\nXenophanes of Colophon, in Asia Minor, whose contributions to mental\r\nscience formed the basis of Plato’s metaphysics.\r\n\r\nThe period roughly embraced between the years 500 and 300 B.\r\nC. represents the most brilliant age of Greek intellectual and\r\nartistic activity. During this time there came into prominence such\r\nphilosophers, historians, poets, physicians, artists and generals of\r\narmies as had never before been marshaled in historic array in so\r\nrapid succession. Even at this late day the names of these great men\r\nare almost household words--such names, for example, as Pythagoras,\r\nAlcmaeon, Anaxagoras, Aristotle, Plato, Socrates, Sophocles,\r\nAeschylus, Euripides, Aristophanes, Pindar, Xenophon, Demosthenes,\r\nDemocedes, Hippocrates the Great, Phidias, Praxiteles, Zeuxis,\r\nApelles, Darius I., Alexander the Great, and many others of almost\r\nequal celebrity. During the centuries immediately preceding this\r\ngolden age of Greek history, there seem to have been very few men of\r\ngreat merit in any of the branches of learning or in the fields of\r\nwar or art, but this impression is certainly false. It is doubtless\r\nto be explained by the fact that large quantities of documentary\r\nevidence relating to these years have been entirely lost. Daniel Le\r\nClerc, for instance, states[21] that, of the separate histories of\r\nthe descendants of Aesculapius which were written by Eratosthenes,\r\nPherecydes, Apollodorus, Arius of Tarsus and Polyanthus of Cyrene,\r\nnot one has come down to our time. If, then, in the single department\r\nof medicine, the destruction of documentary evidence was as great as\r\nis here represented, how enormous must have been the loss of precious\r\nhistorical materials in all the departments of human activity taken\r\ntogether. We may, therefore, safely assume that this golden age, which\r\nlasted only about two hundred years, represents simply the culmination\r\nof an even longer period of slow but steady development, a period of\r\ncreditable though perhaps less brilliant achievements.\r\n\r\nOf the names mentioned above there are several that belong to men who\r\nwere in various ways connected with the early history of medicine.\r\nPythagoras, for example, is said to have been one of the first among\r\nthe Greek philosophers to exert a strong and double impression upon\r\nthe medical teaching of that period. He was born in the Island of\r\nSamos, near the coast of Asia Minor, about the year 575 B. C. After\r\nspending several years in Egypt for purposes of study, and probably\r\nvisiting Babylon, at that time a great centre of learning and of\r\nartistic cultivation, he established at Crotona, in the south of Italy,\r\na school[22] where natural philosophy, mathematics, acoustics, etc.,\r\nwere taught. He also devoted some attention to anatomy, to embryology,\r\nto physiology and to therapeutics. According to his views of what\r\nconstituted hygienic living a man should accustom himself to a diet\r\nof the simplest character, without meat. Pythagoras was a believer in\r\nthe Chaldean doctrine that the uneven numbers possess a more important\r\nsignificance than the even, and that the number seven in particular\r\nhas a special relationship to the phenomena of certain diseases; the\r\ncrisis frequently falling on the seventh, fourteenth, or twenty-first\r\nday. Galen, it is said, expressed surprise that a man as sensible and\r\nlearned as Pythagoras should have paid any attention to such trifles.\r\nNot a few of the disciples of Pythagoras were physicians, and when\r\nthe brotherhood (if such it may be called) broke up, as it did in the\r\nfifth century B. C., these men traveled about from one Grecian city to\r\nanother; from which fact they were given the name of “periodeuts” or\r\nambulant physicians. Crotona was also celebrated as the birthplace of\r\nMilo, the athlete.\r\n\r\nDemocedes, who was a contemporary of Pythagoras, but not one of his\r\ndisciples, was a native of Crotona. Dion Cassius, the author of a Roman\r\nhistory, ranks him and Hippocrates as the two most eminent physicians\r\nof antiquity. Daremberg, who derived his facts from the works of\r\nHerodotus, gives the following account of the adventures of Democedes:--\r\n\r\n   Being unable to bear any longer the frequent anger and harsh\r\n   treatment of his father, Calliphon, Democedes left Crotona,\r\n   and settled in practice at Aegina, on the Saronic Gulf, not\r\n   far from Athens. Almost from the very start he attained marked\r\n   success, and already in the second year of his residence in\r\n   Aegina he was made the recipient of a pension of one talent\r\n   (equal to about £240, or $1200,) out of the public treasury.\r\n   During the following year he was induced, by the offer of a\r\n   larger pension (100 minae, or about $3000,) to settle in Athens;\r\n   and, a year later, he accepted a still larger remuneration from\r\n   Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos. Having accompanied the latter\r\n   on a trip to Sardis, the capital of Lydia, in Asia Minor, he\r\n   fell a prisoner into the hands of the governor of that city,\r\n   and was made by him a slave. Not long afterward Darius gained\r\n   possession of this governor’s or satrap’s property, including\r\n   all his slaves; and thus, despite all his efforts to conceal\r\n   his profession through fear that a knowledge of it on the part\r\n   of the king might prolong his bondage indefinitely, Democedes\r\n   was unable to do so. The discovery came about in the following\r\n   manner. During a hunting trip Darius broke his ankle. He called\r\n   to his assistance the court physicians, who were esteemed the\r\n   most skilful that could be found in all Egypt, but they failed\r\n   to give him relief. By the violence of their manipulations\r\n   they rather made matters worse. For seven days and nights his\r\n   sufferings were so great that he was unable to obtain any sleep.\r\n   Finally, on the eighth day, one of the court attendants having\r\n   told Darius that there was a Greek physician among the slaves,\r\n   Democedes was sent for, and he appeared before the king clad in\r\n   rags and with chains on his ankles. When asked whether he knew\r\n   anything about medicine he denied such knowledge, being fearful\r\n   that the discovery of the truth about himself would stand in\r\n   the way of his ever getting back to Greece. Darius, perceiving\r\n   that he was dissimulating, ordered the attendants to fetch the\r\n   whips and pinchers. Whereupon Democedes made up his mind that\r\n   he had better confess the truth. He accordingly told the king\r\n   that, while not possessing a thorough knowledge of the healing\r\n   art, long association with a physician had familiarized him\r\n   more or less with the subject. The king then asked him to take\r\n   charge of the case. Democedes, following the treatment adopted\r\n   by the Greek physicians in similar conditions, applied soothing\r\n   remedies and soon succeeded in procuring sleep for the suffering\r\n   king. Eventually he obtained a complete cure, and Darius, who\r\n   had made up his mind that he would never again be able to use\r\n   his limb, was naturally delighted with the result. He loaded\r\n   Democedes with gifts, and, being charmed with his conversation,\r\n   made him sit at the royal table and did everything possible to\r\n   render court life attractive; but liberty was denied him, which\r\n   was the one thing that Democedes most ardently desired. The only\r\n   use which the latter made of the great influence which he had\r\n   obtained over Darius was to save the Egyptian physicians from\r\n   the death by crucifixion which the king had decided to inflict\r\n   upon them for their lack of skill.\r\n\r\n   The means of escape finally presented themselves to Democedes\r\n   in a most unexpected manner. Atossa, who was the wife of Darius\r\n   and also the daughter of Cyrus, was afflicted with a swelling of\r\n   the breast which developed into an abscess and began to burrow\r\n   into the neighboring tissues. After, for a time, concealing\r\n   the trouble through a sense of false modesty, she made up her\r\n   mind to consult Democedes. He had the good fortune to cure her\r\n   of this malady in a relatively short time. As preparations\r\n   were then being made to send a number of spies to Greece with\r\n   instructions to examine the coast carefully for the purpose\r\n   of determining at what points the defenses were sufficiently\r\n   weak to render an attack by the Persians reasonably sure of\r\n   success, Democedes asked permission of Darius to accompany these\r\n   men as their guide. His request was granted; and, as soon as\r\n   the expedition reached Tarentum in Calabria, he delivered the\r\n   Persian spies into the hands of Aristophilides, the king of that\r\n   country, and then fled in all haste to Crotona, his native city.\r\n   Shortly afterward these Persians, having been set at liberty by\r\n   Aristophilides, made the attempt to capture Democedes and carry\r\n   him off by main force, but the citizens of Crotona thwarted\r\n   the attempt and compelled the men to return to Asia. Democedes\r\n   then married the daughter of Milo, the athlete, and history\r\n   furnishes no information regarding the subsequent career of this\r\n   extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nDaremberg calls attention to certain excellent proverbs which may be\r\nfound in the writings of the Greek poets and which are of some interest\r\nto physicians. The following may serve as examples of those most widely\r\nknown:--[23]\r\n\r\n   Joy is the best physician for fatigue.\r\n                                (Pindar, 522–442 B. C.)\r\n\r\n   The good physician is he who knows how to employ the right\r\n   remedies at the proper time; the poor one, he who, in the\r\n   presence of a serious illness, loses his courage, becomes\r\n   flustered, and is unable to devise any helpful method of\r\n   treatment.\r\n                                 (Aeschylus, 525–456 B. C.)\r\n\r\n   Physician, heal thyself.\r\n                        (Euripides, 400–406 B. C.)\r\n\r\nAdvice given to Phaedra by her nurse:--\r\n\r\n   If thou hast some ailment which thou dost not care to reveal to\r\n   men, here are women who are competent to treat the condition\r\n   properly.\r\n                                                    (Euripides.)\r\n\r\n    Sleep is the physician of pain,\r\n  and\r\n    Death is the supreme healer of maladies.\r\n                                      (Sophocles, 495–406 B. C.)\r\n\r\nIn Plato’s writings there are to be found a few passages in which this\r\nphilosopher gives his views in regard to certain matters that are not\r\nwithout interest to modern physicians. The following extracts are of\r\nthis nature:--\r\n\r\n   There is not then, my friend, any office among the whole\r\n   inhabitants of the city peculiar to the woman, considered as a\r\n   woman, nor to the man, considered as a man; but the geniuses\r\n   are indiscriminately diffused through both: the woman is\r\n   naturally fitted for sharing in all offices, and so is the man;\r\n   but in all the woman is weaker than the man.\r\n\r\n   Perfectly so.\r\n\r\n   Shall we then commit everything to the care of the men, and\r\n   nothing to the care of the women?\r\n\r\n   How shall we do so?\r\n\r\n   It is therefore, I imagine, as we say, that one woman, too, is\r\n   fitted by natural genius for being a physician, and another is\r\n   not; one is naturally a musician, and another is not.\r\n\r\n    (From “The Republic” of Plato, translated by Spens.)\r\n\r\n   But tell me with reference to him who, accurately speaking, is\r\n   a physician, whom you now mentioned, whether he is a gainer of\r\n   money or one who taketh care of the sick? and speak of him who\r\n   is really a physician.\r\n\r\n   One who taketh care, said he, of the sick.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Why then, said I, no physician as far as he is a physician,\r\n   considers what is advantageous for the physician, nor enjoins\r\n   it, but what is advantageous for the sick; for it hath been\r\n   agreed that the accurate physician is one who taketh care of\r\n   sick bodies, and not an amasser of wealth. Hath it not been\r\n   agreed?\r\n\r\n   He assented.\r\n                     (Plato, 428–547 B. C., translated by Spens.)\r\n\r\nBut Plato’s knowledge of human anatomy and physiology was very crude\r\nand in some instances decidedly fanciful. In corroboration of this\r\nstatement the following extract from the “Timaeus” may be quoted:--\r\n\r\n   And on this account, fearing to defile the Divine nature more\r\n   than was absolutely necessary, they [the junior gods] lodged\r\n   man’s mortal portion separately from the Divine, in a different\r\n   receptacle of the body; forming the head and breast and placing\r\n   the neck between, as an isthmus and limit to separate the two\r\n   extremes.\r\n\r\n   In the breast, indeed, and what is called the thorax, they\r\n   seated the mortal part of the soul. And as one part of it was\r\n   naturally better, and another worse, they formed the cavity of\r\n   the thorax into two divisions (resembling the separate dwellings\r\n   of our men and women), placing the midriff as a partition\r\n   between them. That part of the soul, therefore, which partakes\r\n   of fortitude and spirit and loves contention they seated\r\n   nearer the head between the midriff and the neck; as it is the\r\n   business of the reason to unite with it in forcibly repressing\r\n   the desires, whenever they will not obey the mandate and word\r\n   issuing from the citadel above.\r\n\r\n   The heart, which is the head and principle of the veins as well\r\n   as the fountain of the blood that impetuously circulates through\r\n   all the members, they placed in a kind of sentry-house, that, in\r\n   case of any outburst of anger, being informed by the reason of\r\n   any evil committed in its members, owing either to some foreign\r\n   cause, or else internal passions, it (the heart) might transmit\r\n   through all its channels the threatenings and exhortations of\r\n   reason, so as once more to reduce the body to perfect obedience,\r\n   and so permit what is the best within us to maintain supreme\r\n   command.\r\n\r\n   But as the gods foreknew, with respect to the palpitation of\r\n   the heart under the dread of danger and the excitement of\r\n   passion, that all such swellings of the inflamed spirit would\r\n   be produced by fire, they formed the lungs to be a sort of\r\n   protection thereto; first of all, soft and bloodless, and next\r\n   internally provided with cavities perforated like a sponge, in\r\n   order to cool the breath which they receive, and give the heart\r\n   easy respiration and repose in its excessive heat. On this\r\n   account, then, they led the channels of the windpipe into the\r\n   lungs, which they placed like a soft cushion round the heart, in\r\n   order that when anger rises in it to an extreme height it might\r\n   fall on some yielding substance, and, so getting cool, yield\r\n   cheerfully and with less trouble to the authority of reason.\r\n                     (Plato’s “Timaeus,” translated by Henry Davis.)\r\n\r\nAlcmaeon, Empedocles, Diogenes of Apollonia, Anaxagoras and Pausanias,\r\nwhose names are mentioned above in the list of eminent men who\r\nflourished during the golden age of Greek history, are entitled to\r\nfurther consideration. Alcmaeon of Crotona was a contemporary and\r\ndisciple of Pythagoras. He was specially devoted to the study of\r\nanatomy and physiology, and is credited with the distinction of\r\nhaving been the first person to dissect animals for the purpose of\r\nlearning the formation of the different parts of their bodies. With the\r\nexception of a few fragments that are to be found scattered throughout\r\nancient medical literature, Alcmaeon’s writings have all been lost.\r\nThe discovery of the optic nerve is credited to him, and Neuburger\r\nstates that he deserves still greater credit for having been the first\r\nto declare that the brain is the central organ of all intellectual\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nOf all the disciples of Pythagoras, Empedocles attained the greatest\r\ncelebrity. He flourished about 444 B. C., his residence being at\r\nAgrigentum, in Sicily. Much of his reputation appears to have been\r\ndue to the mystery which surrounded many of his actions. He was even\r\nreputed to have brought again to life persons who were believed to be\r\ndead. His works were all in verse, but only fragments have come down\r\nto us. He placed the seat of hearing in the labyrinth of the temporal\r\nbone. His death occurred in Peloponnesus at the age of sixty, as the\r\nresult of an accident.\r\n\r\nAnaxagoras was born at Clazomenae, in Ionia, 500 B. C. He was the\r\nteacher of Euripides, the Athenian poet, and Pericles, the greatest of\r\nAthenian statesmen. He and his contemporary, Diogenes of Apollonia, in\r\nCrete, devoted a great deal of attention to the study of anatomy. They\r\ndissected animals and made some genuine discoveries; Anaxagoras noting\r\nthe existence of the lateral ventricles of the brain, and Diogenes\r\nfurnishing a description--very erroneous, it is true--of the vascular\r\nsystem of the body. Puschmann says that, according to Aristotle,\r\nthe philosophers of that period considered the study of man and his\r\ndiseases the most important one to which they could devote their time\r\nand thoughts. Many of them indeed had been educated as physicians, and\r\nnot a few were actual practitioners of medicine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                         HIPPOCRATES THE GREAT\r\n\r\n\r\nHippocrates was born in 460 B. C. in the city of Cos, on the island of\r\nthe same name. Both his father and grandfather were eminent physicians,\r\ndescendants of Aesculapius. On his mother’s side he traced his descent\r\nfrom Hercules. The famous painter, Apelles, also hailed from the city\r\nof Cos. To distinguish Hippocrates from an earlier individual of the\r\nsame name he was called Hippocrates II., or the Great. He is said to\r\nhave received his first instruction in medicine at the school of the\r\nAsclepiadae in his native city, but his frequently repeated and very\r\nfavorable comments on the teachings of the Cnidian school[24] have\r\nled some to believe that he may have received a part of his medical\r\ntraining at the latter institution. At a later period of his life his\r\npopularity as a teacher of medicine, in the school of the Asclepiadae\r\nat Cos, attracted many pupils to that city. In accordance with a custom\r\nwhich prevailed among the physicians of ancient Greece, Hippocrates,\r\nat the beginning of his career, spent quite a long time in Athens, and\r\nthen traveled about, from one city to another, in the character of a\r\nperiodeutic or itinerant physician. In this way, as he himself reports\r\nin some of his writings, he visited Thessaly, Thrace, the Island of\r\nThasos, Scythia, the countries bordering on the Black Sea, and even\r\nNorthern Egypt. Owing largely to domestic troubles he left his home in\r\nCos, during the latter part of his career, and removed to Thessaly.\r\nHe died about 370 B. C. at Larissa, at an advanced age. Soranus of\r\nEphesus, the celebrated obstetrician, reported that in his time (second\r\ncentury A. D.) the tomb of Hippocrates was still standing, and that\r\nit had been taken possession of by a swarm of bees whose honey was\r\nfar-famed for its efficacy in curing ulcers of the mouth in children.\r\n\r\nAmong the pupils of Hippocrates were his two sons, Draco and Thessalus,\r\nand his son-in-law, Polybus. Thessalus, in the capacity of a military\r\nsurgeon, accompanied Alcibiades on his expedition to Sicily, and\r\nlater in his career he served as private physician to Archelaus, King\r\nof Macedonia. It is also believed that a number of the writings in\r\nthe Hippocratic collection are from his pen. On the other hand, it\r\nis a well-established fact that Polybus is the author of a few of\r\nthese treatises. When Hippocrates gave up the work of teaching, his\r\nson-in-law, who was at that time engaged in private practice in Cos,\r\nwas chosen his successor in the school.\r\n\r\nAmong the many anecdotes which are related of Hippocrates, there is one\r\nwhich may with propriety be repeated here:--\r\n\r\n   On the occasion of a visit to Abdera, in the northern part of\r\n   Thrace, Hippocrates was requested to examine into the mental\r\n   condition of the philosopher Democritus, who was thought by\r\n   his narrow-minded countrymen to be insane. Hippocrates found\r\n   him deeply engrossed in the study of natural philosophy and\r\n   asked him what he was doing. Democritus replied that he was\r\n   investigating the foolishness of men. Whereupon Hippocrates\r\n   reported that he considered Democritus the wisest of men.\r\n   (Pagel.)\r\n\r\nNo better evidence of the true greatness of a man can be furnished than\r\nthat which is afforded by the praise of his contemporaries in the same\r\nrank or walk of life; and when the appreciation comes from such men as\r\nPlato and Aristotle, it constitutes an absolute guarantee that it is\r\nwell and honestly earned. To Hippocrates belongs the singular honor\r\nof having won unstinted praise from both of these great philosophers,\r\nAristotle giving him the title of “Hippocrates the Great,” and Plato\r\ncomparing him to those famous sculptors, Polyclytus and Phidias. His\r\nwritings and those of the members of his family who were associated\r\nwith him in the work of promoting a knowledge of medicine were most\r\ncarefully preserved by his successors. When the Ptolemies began to\r\nestablish libraries at Alexandria, Egypt (285 B. C.), and manifested\r\na decided readiness to purchase the works of the most celebrated\r\nauthors, copies of the Hippocratic writings were among those which\r\nfound their way to that city. This eagerness on the part of the Kings\r\nof Egypt to purchase books or manuscripts stimulated unscrupulous\r\npersons to attribute to celebrated authors not a few of these works\r\nwhich they offered for sale. The librarians, whose duty it was to\r\nguard against such frauds, were not sufficiently well informed to\r\nprevent them; and thus there were accepted, as genuine productions,\r\na few books which could not possibly have been written by those to\r\nwhom they were attributed. The collection of Hippocratic writings\r\ndid not escape this fate, and the evil was also further aggravated\r\nby the fact that copyists and incompetent editors made all sorts of\r\nemendations and additions on their own responsibility. Thus, it is\r\nnot surprising that a collection which originally contained only the\r\nwritings of Hippocrates and his immediate family, should in course of\r\ntime have become expanded, not only by such alterations as have just\r\nbeen described, but also by the addition of entire works that had\r\nbeen written by others. At the beginning of the third century B. C.,\r\nthe Ptolemies appointed a committee of learned men in Alexandria to\r\nexamine carefully the treatises reputed to be the work of Hippocrates\r\nand to make a collection of those which appeared to them to be\r\ngenuine. They performed this task to the best of their ability, but\r\nthe result showed that they lacked the necessary critical powers; and\r\nconsequently during the past 2000 years repeated attempts have been\r\nmade to do what they failed to accomplish, but these efforts have only\r\nsucceeded in part. The French edition prepared by Émile Littré, the\r\ndistinguished member of the French Academy of Medicine, and published\r\nin the years 1839–1861, was, until quite recently, universally\r\naccepted as embodying the best results of modern research and criticism\r\nwith regard to this difficult question. But since 1861 other scholars\r\nhave been busily engaged in perfecting the text of the Hippocratic\r\nwritings, and their criticisms and suggestions have made it possible to\r\npublish a German version of this great work which is of more practical\r\nvalue to physicians than that of Littré, which forms a series of ten\r\nlarge volumes and is no longer easy to obtain. On the other hand, the\r\nGerman version by Robert Fuchs (Munich, 1895–1900), in three volumes\r\nof moderate size, while in no respect inferior to the famous French\r\ntranslation, is superior to it in several particulars: it is better\r\nadapted to the needs of the ordinary practitioner of medicine, it\r\nembodies the results of the excellent critical work done since 1861\r\n(e.g., by Ermerins of Utrecht, Daremberg of France, and Ilberg and\r\nKühlewein of Germany), and it costs very much less than its French\r\npredecessor and rival.\r\n\r\nAs regards the question of authenticity of the treatises contained in\r\nthe work known as “The Hippocratic Writings” the most important thing\r\nto be determined is, not whether this or that book or chapter in the\r\ncollection was really written by Hippocrates, but whether the work in\r\nits totality gives a correct and fairly complete picture of the best\r\nmedical thought and practice of the period during which Hippocrates\r\nlived; and to this question a decided answer in the affirmative may be\r\ngiven. As to the broad question of authenticity, Max Neuburger, the\r\ndistinguished Viennese author of the latest and most authoritative\r\nhistory of medicine, thus expresses himself:--\r\n\r\n   Notwithstanding the extremely small quantity of evidence which\r\n   the so-called “Hippocratic Writings” themselves furnish as to\r\n   who were the writers of the individual treatises and as to what\r\n   Hippocrates himself actually did or thought; and although it\r\n   is true that portions of the collection often contradict one\r\n   another both in regard to questions of theory and also in regard\r\n   to methods of treatment, one fact stands out conspicuously,\r\n   viz., that the peculiar character of these writings both as a\r\n   collection and taken separately, not only gives them a unique\r\n   position in medical literature, but reveals plainly that\r\n   they owe their origin directly or indirectly to the powerful\r\n   influence of a single commanding personality.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner of teaching medicine, the Hippocratic writings show\r\nthat, at the time which is here under consideration, the mystical\r\nfeatures had almost completely disappeared. The science was now taught\r\nby regular instructors, who agreed for a stipulated fee to take charge\r\nof the pupil’s entire training from the beginning to the end of the\r\ncourse. Candidates who were in delicate health were discouraged from\r\nentering upon the career of a physician, and those who had completed\r\nthe regular course of instruction were sent out into the world equipped\r\nwith certain general principles for their future guidance in actual\r\npractice. Some of these bear a close resemblance to the principles of\r\na similar nature which had been established at a much earlier period\r\nin India. For example, the importance of cleanliness of the person is\r\nstrongly emphasized. Reticence, as well as courtesy, is classed as one\r\nof the virtues of a good physician.\r\n\r\n   He who acts hastily and does not take sufficient time for\r\n   consideration is sure to be criticised unfavorably. If he breaks\r\n   out too readily into laughter he will be thought uncultivated.\r\n\r\nIn another of the Hippocratic writings the physician is urged not to\r\nindulge in too much small talk, but to confine his conversation as much\r\nas possible to matters relating to the treatment of the disorder.\r\n\r\n   In his business dealings the physician, like a genuine\r\n   philosopher, should not display a greed for money, he should\r\n   assume a modest and dignified attitude, he should appear quiet\r\n   and calm, and his speech should be simple and straightforward\r\n   and free from all superstition.\r\n\r\nFor their knowledge of human anatomy the physicians of that period\r\nwere obliged to depend on the dissection of animals. Specimens of\r\nhuman bones were of course easily accessible, and consequently the\r\ndescriptions which are given of these structures are quite accurate,\r\neven as regards many of the finer details.\r\n\r\nIt would be a very difficult matter to furnish here, within a limited\r\nspace, a reasonably clear exposition of the views held by Hippocrates\r\nwith regard to human physiology and pathology. Empedocles, a Greek\r\nphysician and high priest of Agrigentum, in Sicily, who was born about\r\n490 B. C., founded a system of philosophy on the theory that the\r\nuniverse is made up of four elements--fire, air, earth and water; and\r\nhe maintained that fire is the essence of life, the other elements\r\nforming the basis of matter. It was upon this system that Hippocrates\r\nfounded his own theories of life, death and disease, but he disagreed\r\nwith Empedocles in regard to the manner in which the four elements\r\nare united, his own belief being that they form together a genuine\r\nmixture, whereas Empedocles maintains that their union represents\r\nmerely a mechanical aggregation of separate atoms. He also held that\r\nthese original four elements, to which he gave the names of heat,\r\ncold, dryness and moisture, were represented in the human body by the\r\nfollowing four cardinal fluids or “juices”: blood, mucus or phlegm,\r\nblack bile and yellow bile.[25] He maintained, further, that when these\r\nelements are mingled harmoniously so as to produce a state of perfect\r\nequilibrium, health resulted; but that when some deficiency of one or\r\nmore of them, or some lack of harmony between them in other respects,\r\noccurs, disease is produced. At a later date, a fifth element--wind or\r\nair (pneuma)--was added to the other four; and when Hippocrates was\r\nunable to account satisfactorily for certain phenomena of disease, he\r\nwas wont to refer the phenomenon observed to divine interference.\r\n\r\nThis brief exposition of the physiological and pathological views\r\nheld by Hippocrates, incomplete and superficial as it is, will have\r\nto suffice. Those who wish to acquire a more profound knowledge of\r\nthe subject should consult some of the larger treatises like those of\r\nDaremberg, of Max Neuburger, and of Pagel, as well as the sections\r\ndevoted to these subjects in the French (Littré) and the German (Fuchs)\r\nversions of the Hippocratic writings. At every step in such a study,\r\nthe modern physician will encounter ideas and individual terms which he\r\nwill have great difficulty in comprehending; and later on, as he reads\r\nthe sections which deal with the more practical matters of the medical\r\nart, he will be astonished to find that Hippocrates was a most acute\r\nand trustworthy observer of the phenomena of disease, a remarkably\r\nclear writer, and a standard-bearer of very high aims.\r\n\r\nIn the examination and treatment of the sick the physicians of\r\nancient Greece were highly trained. They paid very close attention\r\nto the patient’s account of his symptoms, but it was to the physical\r\nexamination of the diseased body that they attached the greatest\r\nimportance. They noted with extreme care the color and other\r\npeculiarities of the skin and mucous membranes, the condition of the\r\nabdomen, and the shape and movements of the thorax; they tested the\r\npatient’s temperature by placing the hand upon the body; and all\r\nthe excretions were subjected to the closest scrutiny. By means of\r\npalpation they were able to determine not only the size of the liver\r\nand spleen, but also the changes which occur in the form of these\r\norgans in the course of certain diseases. They utilized succussion\r\nboth as an aid to diagnosis and as a means of favoring the breaking\r\nthrough of pus into the bronchial tubes. They were familiar with the\r\npleuritic friction sound and with the finest râles, which they compared\r\nto the creaking of leather or “the noise of boiling vinegar.” In\r\ntheir descriptions of these sounds it is distinctly stated that the\r\nexaminer’s ear was kept tightly pressed against the patient’s chest.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the accounts of individual diseases which appear in the\r\nHippocratic writings, Puschmann says that they are evidently based\r\non cases actually observed in practice, and that they are admirably\r\nwritten. It is in the laws which they have laid down with regard to\r\nthe treatment of disease, however, that the Hippocratic writers have\r\ngained their chief distinction, a distinction which will belong to them\r\nthrough all time.\r\n\r\n   The physician should be the handy man of Nature, and he should\r\n   strive to aid and to imitate her efforts to effect a cure.\r\n   His first care should be to remove, so far as is possible,\r\n   the causes of the disease; and then, in the conduct of the\r\n   treatment, he should keep in view at all times the special\r\n   circumstances of the case, giving closer attention to the\r\n   patient than to the disease itself. In short, he should aim at\r\n   being useful, or at least he should be careful not to do any\r\n   harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n         BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THE HIPPOCRATIC WRITINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statements which have thus far been made in these pages with regard\r\nto Hippocrates are only of a general character, and it may therefore\r\nbe interesting for the reader to have placed before him a few selected\r\nextracts from the writings which have formed the basis of these\r\nstatements. The English text here used is a translation of the German\r\nversion of Robert Fuchs, to which reference has already been made.\r\nIt would have been a pleasure to use for this purpose the admirable\r\nEnglish translation of Frederick Adams, published in 1849 under the\r\nauspices of the Sydenham Society of Great Britain; but, unfortunately,\r\nthis version contains only a part of the Hippocratic writings, and,\r\nbesides, this writer did not at that time have the advantage of\r\nconsulting the French and German versions which have been published\r\nsince 1849.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost unnecessary to state here, by way of preface, that the\r\nsmall amount of space which may properly be devoted to these extracts\r\nrenders it necessary to present many of them in a very fragmentary\r\nand disconnected form, merely enough text being furnished to give the\r\nreader some slight idea both of the manner in which Hippocrates and\r\nthose associated with him handled certain medical topics, and also of\r\nthe views which they entertained with regard to the same subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n         BRIEF EXTRACTS FROM SOME OF THE HIPPOCRATIC WRITINGS\r\n\r\n   _Aphorisms._--I.--1. Life is short, art is long, the right\r\n   moment lasts but an instant,[26] experience is often deceptive,\r\n   a correct judgment is hard to reach.\r\n\r\n   6. For the most serious ills extreme measures cautiously\r\n   employed are the best.\r\n\r\n   8. When an illness has reached its acme the lightest diet must\r\n   be prescribed.\r\n\r\n   11. During the exacerbations nourishment should be withheld, for\r\n   at these times the giving of food is harmful; and in illnesses\r\n   which are characterized by periodic paroxysms it is also best\r\n   not to give food during the paroxysms.\r\n\r\n   13. Old people bear fasting very well, and the same is almost\r\n   true of persons of mature age; but young individuals do not bear\r\n   abstinence from food so well, and this is particularly the case\r\n   with children, especially with those of a lively disposition.\r\n\r\n   24. In acute illnesses laxative remedies should rarely be\r\n   administered, and then only in the early stage of the malady and\r\n   with great caution.\r\n\r\n   II.--2. When sleep puts an end to delirium it is a good sign.\r\n\r\n   3. When either sleep or wakefulness oversteps the proper limit\r\n   it is harmful.\r\n\r\n   5. Causeless depression is an indication of some disorder.\r\n\r\n   19. In acute diseases the prognosis as regards either death or\r\n   recovery, is very uncertain.\r\n\r\n   44. Corpulent persons are more likely than those who are slender\r\n   to die a quick death.\r\n\r\n   V.--7. When epileptic attacks occur before the age of puberty,\r\n   a change for the better may be looked for; but if the disease\r\n   makes its first appearance when the individual has already\r\n   reached his twenty-fifth year, he may be expected to carry the\r\n   affliction with him to the time of his death.\r\n\r\n   9. Consumption most commonly attacks persons who are between the\r\n   ages of eighteen and thirty-five.\r\n\r\n   14. When a consumptive person has attacks of diarrhoea, a fatal\r\n   issue may be anticipated.\r\n\r\n   VII.--1. If in the course of an acute illness the extremities\r\n   grow cold, it is an unfavorable sign.\r\n\r\n   14. If, after a blow upon the head, stupefaction or delirium\r\n   manifests itself, the outlook is bad.\r\n\r\n[The total number of the aphorisms is 422.]\r\n\r\n   _The Book of Prognoses._--1. I believe that it is best\r\n   for a physician to acquire a certain degree of practice in the\r\n   power to predict how the disease is likely to terminate; for if,\r\n   when he is in the presence of his patient, he is able to state,\r\n   not only what is going to take place in the future course of\r\n   the malady, but also certain other facts which relate to the\r\n   past behavior of the attack, but which were omitted from the\r\n   account given to him of the previous history of the case, he\r\n   will impress the patient with the belief that he is thoroughly\r\n   familiar with the disease from which the latter is suffering,\r\n   and that consequently he is a physician in whose knowledge and\r\n   skill he can place entire confidence. Then, besides, he will be\r\n   the gainer in another respect: his knowledge of what is likely\r\n   to be the subsequent course of any given disease will enable\r\n   him to treat it in the most effective manner. The ability to\r\n   restore all his patients to health would of course be a greater\r\n   power than that of correctly predicting the future behavior\r\n   of a malady in any particular case. This ability, however, is\r\n   clearly unattainable. One patient dies by reason of the severity\r\n   of the disease itself, even before the physician is called in;\r\n   a second one, shortly after the latter’s visit; and a third\r\n   lingers on for a day or two after the doctor’s arrival, dying\r\n   before the latter’s art has had time to produce a beneficial\r\n   effect in hindering the advance of the malady. The observation\r\n   of these different events should enable the physician to become\r\n   acquainted with the nature of the diseases observed, and--more\r\n   particularly--to learn to what extent, in individual instances,\r\n   they manifest a strength greater than the patient’s power of\r\n   resistance. At the same time, he must not forget that in many\r\n   cases divine interference plays a part in directing the course\r\n   of the disease. And thus, if he pays heed to all these things,\r\n   the physician will merit the confidence of his patients and will\r\n   gain the reputation of being a clever and skilful practitioner.\r\n\r\n   IV.--It is better when the physician, upon the occasion of his\r\n   first visit, finds the patient lying upon one side, with his\r\n   hands, neck and thighs slightly flexed, and the entire body\r\n   placed in a perfectly natural position, like that which a man\r\n   assumes in bed when he is in a state of health. It is not so\r\n   well when the physician finds the patient lying upon his back,\r\n   with his hands, neck and thighs extended. But if the latter\r\n   is found curled up and sliding down toward the foot of the\r\n   bed, this is an unfavorable sign. Finally, if he is found with\r\n   rather cold feet projecting from under the bedclothes, and with\r\n   his arms outstretched and his neck and thighs exposed, his\r\n   condition may be considered dangerous, for this attitude of the\r\n   body betokens an agitated state of the mind. If the patient\r\n   sleeps with his mouth constantly open, lying upon his back and\r\n   with his thighs strongly flexed and widely separated, it may be\r\n   assumed that death is near at hand. If he lies upon his belly\r\n   when it is known that he was not in the habit of sleeping in\r\n   this manner before he was taken ill, the inference is warranted\r\n   either that he is delirious or that he is suffering from pain in\r\n   the lower part of his abdomen. Finally, if the patient shows an\r\n   inclination to maintain a sitting posture while the malady is\r\n   still in an active stage, this feature must be looked upon as a\r\n   grave symptom and especially so in inflammation of the lungs.\r\n\r\n   XIV.--Pus that has a whitish color and a uniform consistency,\r\n   that is smooth and free from clumps, and the odor of which is\r\n   only slightly unpleasant, is the least harmful. On the other\r\n   hand, a pus which possesses the opposite characteristics is very\r\n   dangerous.\r\n\r\n   XL.--Severe pain in the ear, if associated with a persistent\r\n   fever is dangerous, for the patient may become delirious and die.\r\n\r\n[There are 47 chapters in the Book of Prognoses; in addition, there\r\nare 740 separate sections in the Coan Prognoses (_Praenotiones\r\nCoacae_).]\r\n\r\n   _The Epidemic Diseases._--VI.--4. The wife of Agasis\r\n   had already as a young girl been troubled with shortness of\r\n   breath. After she had reached womanhood, and soon after she had\r\n   given birth to a child, she lifted a heavy weight. Immediately\r\n   she heard, as she believed, a noise in her chest, and on the\r\n   following day she experienced some difficulty in breathing and a\r\n   certain amount of pain in her right hip. These two symptoms were\r\n   so related to each other that, whenever the pain in the hip made\r\n   its appearance, she immediately became conscious that she was\r\n   short of breath, and, vice versa, whenever the pain ceased, she\r\n   found that her breathing became easier. Her expectoration was\r\n   of a foamy character and of a rather bright color, but, after\r\n   it had been allowed to stand for a short time, it looked like\r\n   diluted biliary matter that had been vomited. The pain in the\r\n   hip troubled her chiefly when she performed manual work. She was\r\n   advised to abstain from eating garlic, pork, mutton, and beef,\r\n   and not to call loudly or to get excited while she was engaged\r\n   in work.\r\n\r\n   VII.--7. The wife of Polycrates became feverish during the\r\n   summer season, and about the time of the dog star. In the\r\n   morning her breathing was somewhat embarrassed, but after\r\n   mid-day it became more difficult and at the same time more\r\n   rapid. From the very beginning of the illness she had a cough\r\n   and expectorated purulent masses. In the throat and along the\r\n   course of the trachea one could hear a hoarse whistling sound.\r\n   The patient’s face had a healthy color, and over the two halves\r\n   of the jaw there was some redness, not of a deep hue but rather\r\n   fresh and bright. A little later her voice also became hoarse,\r\n   she began to show some emaciation, raw spots developed over\r\n   the fleshy parts of her hips, and the surface of the body grew\r\n   more moist than it had been before. On the seventieth day the\r\n   outward evidences of fever became much less noticeable, but the\r\n   respiration grew more rapid; and from that day to the time of\r\n   her death, five or six days later, she was obliged to remain in\r\n   a sitting posture. Toward the end the tracheal râle grew louder,\r\n   and dangerous sweats occurred, but the patient never lost her\r\n   expression of intelligence.\r\n\r\n   _Fractures._--II.--9. In the human body the foot, like the\r\n   hand, is composed of a number of small bones. As they are not\r\n   easily broken it may safely be assumed, when such a case of\r\n   fracture comes under observation, that some pointed or unusually\r\n   heavy object had caused the lesion, and that the surrounding\r\n   soft parts must necessarily have been injured at the same time.\r\n   (Injuries of this nature will be discussed in a later section.)\r\n   But if any part of this bony framework is pushed out of its\r\n   natural position--whether this take place in one of the toes,\r\n   or in one of the tarsal bones, it makes no difference--the\r\n   dislocated part should be forced back into position in the\r\n   manner recommended in section XXIV. In its essential features\r\n   the treatment consists in the employment of wax plaster,\r\n   compresses, and bandages, exactly the same as is done in the\r\n   treatment of fractures of the long bones, but without splints.\r\n   The same rules hold good with regard to the degree of pressure\r\n   to be applied, and every third day the dressings should be\r\n   renewed. On each occasion of such renewal the patient should be\r\n   questioned with regard to the sensations which he feels after\r\n   the bandages have been applied, and if necessary they should be\r\n   readjusted in accordance with the nature of the answers which\r\n   he gives. The great majority of these injuries heal completely\r\n   in twenty days. The exceptional cases are those in which the\r\n   fracture] involves a bone that stands in immediate relation\r\n   with the bones of the leg. It is advisable, however, that the\r\n   patient should remain in bed during the period mentioned; for,\r\n   in not a few instances, the persons thus affected, failing to\r\n   appreciate the gravity of the injury, walk about before the\r\n   parts have really healed; and then, for an indefinite period\r\n   of time, they are frequently reminded in a painful manner of\r\n   the injury which they received. There is nothing astonishing in\r\n   this when the fact is recalled to mind that the feet support the\r\n   entire weight of the body.\r\n\r\n[Forty-eight chapters or sections, some of them of considerable length,\r\nare devoted to the subject of fractures. The authorities are almost\r\nunanimous in stating that this portion of the so-called Hippocratic\r\nwritings was written by Hippocrates himself. Malgaigne and Petrequin,\r\ntwo of the most competent French writers on questions relating to\r\nsurgery, declare that the treatises written by Hippocrates on fractures\r\nand dislocations (the two forming in reality one continuous treatise)\r\nare the best and most complete books ever written by a physician.]\r\n\r\n   _Wounds of the Head._--10. The physician should, first of\r\n   all, before touching the patient’s head, inspect carefully the\r\n   wound and surrounding parts. After noting whether the injury\r\n   has been inflicted upon a strong or a weak portion of the head,\r\n   he should ascertain whether the hair has been cut by the fall\r\n   or the blow, and whether portions of it have penetrated into\r\n   the wound. In the latter event he should express his fear that\r\n   the skull at this point has been laid bare and has perhaps even\r\n   received some material injury. He should make this statement\r\n   before he has touched or probed the wound. Then afterward he\r\n   should proceed to a physical examination of the injured parts,\r\n   in order that he may learn positively whether the overlying soft\r\n   tissues have or have not been separated from the bone. If simple\r\n   inspection reveals the fact that the skull has been laid bare,\r\n   well and good; but, if the real condition is not thus revealed,\r\n   he should not hesitate to employ the probe. If he finds that the\r\n   soft parts have been separated from the bone and that the latter\r\n   has been more or less injured, he should continue this more\r\n   minute exploration until he shall have ascertained to just what\r\n   extent and in what manner the skull has been injured, and what\r\n   measures are required to remedy the damage; in brief, he should\r\n   make the diagnosis. At the same time, however, he should not\r\n   neglect to question the patient very closely about the manner\r\n   in which the wound was inflicted, for in this way he may be\r\n   able to infer the existence of a contusion, or even a fracture\r\n   of the skull, of which no material evidences are discoverable.\r\n   Important information may also be gathered by passing the hand\r\n   over the seat of injury in the bone,--information which the\r\n   employment of the probe is not competent to convey.\r\n\r\n[Twenty-one additional chapters are devoted to wounds of the head,\r\nevery possible phase of the subject being handled by Hippocrates in the\r\nmost careful and thorough manner.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n          THE STATE OF GREEK MEDICINE AFTER THE EVENTS OF THE\r\n    PELOPONNESIAN WAR; THE FOUNDING OF ALEXANDRIA IN EGYPT, AT THE\r\n     MOUTH OF THE NILE; AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIFFERENT SECTS IN\r\n                               MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nUp to the time when war broke out between Sparta and Athens (431 B.\r\nC.), the latter city had for many years easily held the supremacy, not\r\nmerely in everything relating to the science and art of medicine, but\r\nalso in all other branches of learning and especially in the arts of\r\nsculpture, painting and architecture. At the time named above came the\r\nbeginning of her downfall. For a period of about twenty-one years she\r\nstruggled against disasters of all sorts.\r\n\r\n_The Plague at Athens, the first Recorded in History._--Shortly\r\nafter the war began--a war engendered by the bitter jealousy of Sparta\r\nover the ever increasing ascendancy of her rival--the latter city was\r\nvisited by a devastating plague, the first European pestilence that\r\nhas been recorded in history. Thucydides, who wrote the history of the\r\nPeloponnesian War, gives a most lucid description of this plague of\r\nAthens, from which I shall copy certain portions.\r\n\r\n   It first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above\r\n   Egypt, and thence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most\r\n   of the King’s country. Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first\r\n   attacked the population in Piraeus,--which was the occasion\r\n   of their saying that the Peloponnesians had poisoned the\r\n   reservoirs, there being as yet no wells there,--and afterward\r\n   appeared in the upper city, when the deaths became much more\r\n   frequent. All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if\r\n   causes can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance,\r\n   I leave to other writers, whether lay or professional; for\r\n   myself, I shall simply set down its nature, and explain the\r\n   symptoms by which perhaps it may be recognized by the student,\r\n   if it should ever break out again. This I can the better do,\r\n   as I had the disease myself, and watched its operation in\r\n   the case of others.... People in good health were all of a\r\n   sudden attacked by violent heats in the head and redness and\r\n   inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the throat\r\n   or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid\r\n   breath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness,\r\n   after which the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard\r\n   cough. When it fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges\r\n   of bile of every kind named by physicians ensued, accompanied\r\n   by very great distress. In most cases, also, an ineffectual\r\n   retching followed, producing violent spasms, which in some\r\n   cases ceased soon after, in others much later. Externally the\r\n   body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its appearance,\r\n   but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules and\r\n   ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not\r\n   bear to have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest\r\n   description; or indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What\r\n   they would have liked best would have been to throw themselves\r\n   into cold water; as indeed was done by some of the neglected\r\n   sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in their agonies of\r\n   unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference whether they\r\n   drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling of not\r\n   being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The\r\n   body meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was\r\n   at its height, but held out to a marvel against its ravages;\r\n   so that when they succumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh\r\n   or eighth day to the internal inflammation, they had still\r\n   some strength in them. But if they passed this stage, and the\r\n   disease descended further into the bowels, inducing a violent\r\n   ulceration there accompanied by severe diarrhoea, this brought\r\n   on a weakness which was generally fatal. For the disorder first\r\n   settled in the head, ran its course from thence through the\r\n   whole of the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal, it\r\n   still left its mark on the extremities; ... some, too, escaped\r\n   with the loss of their eyes.... Some died in neglect, others in\r\n   the midst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be\r\n   used as a specific; for what did good in one case, did harm in\r\n   another.... Such was the nature of the calamity, and heavily\r\n   did it weigh on the Athenians; death raging within the city and\r\n   devastation without.\r\n              (Translation of Richard Crawley; Dent & Sons, London.)\r\n\r\n_Athens Ceases to be the Centre of Medical Learning._--It is safe\r\nto assume that one by one the more prominent of the physicians who\r\nhad survived the events which have just been narrated, must have left\r\nAthens and taken up their abode in the various cities of Asia Minor\r\nand the neighboring islands, in Sicily, in Italy, etc. Hippocrates,\r\nwho was thirty years old at the time when the plague broke out in\r\nAthens, appears not to have witnessed it. He practiced his profession\r\nand taught medicine in his native city; then he spent a certain number\r\nof years in traveling about as a peripatetic physician; and finally\r\nsettled for the remainder of his life in Thessaly. But the length of\r\neach of these periods of his professional life is not mentioned by any\r\nof the authorities. About forty years after the death of Hippocrates,\r\nAlexander the Great had already nearly completed his series of\r\nbrilliant conquests, and was taking steps to found a city, or rather, a\r\nuniversity, in which medicine was to take an organized shape as one of\r\nthe great departments of human learning.\r\n\r\nIt may be well at this point, however, to interrupt this narrative\r\nof the regular course of events for the purpose of considering very\r\nbriefly how far the physicians of that period had advanced toward\r\ngaining a permanent and honorable position in their respective\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\n_The Degree of Esteem in which Physicians Were Held by Their Fellow\r\nCitizens and by the Governing Authorities During the Centuries\r\nImmediately Preceding the Christian Era._--We have at our command\r\nvery little direct evidence bearing upon the question of the esteem in\r\nwhich physicians were held three hundred years B. C. by the communities\r\nin which they practiced their profession. We know positively that\r\nthe kings and princes of that period fully appreciated the value of\r\nthe services which were rendered to them by the physicians (commonly\r\nGreeks) whom they employed. In the event of war they took with them\r\nmen who were skilled both in surgery and in the treatment of the\r\nordinary ills of the body. One of the sons of Hippocrates, for example,\r\nserved for some time in this capacity, and he is credited with the\r\nstatement that “the physician who wishes to obtain the best training\r\nin surgery should enter the service of the army.” There were eight\r\nsurgeons officially connected with the “ten thousand” whom Xenophon\r\nled back to Greece after the famous campaign in Asia Minor. The\r\narmy of Alexander the Great was accompanied by the most celebrated\r\nsurgeons of that period. Upon a bronze tablet found at Idalium, on\r\nthe Island of Cyprus, there is an inscription which dates back to the\r\nfifth century B. C., and which commemorates the merits of a physician\r\nnamed Onasilos, who, aided by his pupils, rendered valuable services,\r\nwithout any remuneration, during one of the wars of the Greeks; and in\r\nrecognition of these services, the Government had bestowed upon him a\r\nstipend and had exempted him from taxation. It is further known that\r\nthe Athenians lavishly heaped honors upon Hippocrates, initiating him\r\nat public expense into the mysteries of the Eleusinia, giving him a\r\ncrown of gold, and distinguishing him in still other ways. These facts\r\nshow how highly the rulers of that day appreciated the services of a\r\ncompetent physician; but, up to a comparatively recent date, it has\r\nnot been so easy to demonstrate what was his position in the esteem\r\nof the community at large. The discovery, not many years ago, of two\r\ninscriptions in Greek throw a certain amount of light upon this very\r\npoint. One of these, which bears the date of 388 B. C., states that\r\nits purpose is to commemorate the fact that the physician Euenor, who\r\nhad been intrusted by the people with the work of supervising the\r\npreparation of all the drugs intended for use in the public hospital,\r\nhad not only fulfilled his duty but had in addition spent large sums of\r\nhis own money in the accomplishment of this work. Another inscription,\r\nwhich was unearthed in the Island of Carpathus, between Crete and\r\nRhodes, and which is believed to date back to the end of the fourth\r\nor the beginning of the third century B. C., reads (in a somewhat\r\nabbreviated form) as follows: “In view of the fact that, for more\r\nthan twenty years, Menocritus, the son of Metrodorus of Samos, has\r\ndevoted himself with much zeal and self-sacrifice to the duties of his\r\nposition as parish physician, living all this time in rather narrow\r\ncircumstances and not asking any pay for his services, we, the citizens\r\nof Brycontium, have resolved to erect in his honor, in the temple of\r\nNeptune, a marble column bearing an inscription that shall set forth\r\nthese facts, to crown him with a wreath of gold, and to announce\r\npublicly, at the Aesculapian games, this our decision.” As apropos\r\nof this subject I may be permitted to quote the following words from\r\nPlato’s “The Republic” (Book 1, Chap. 18): “Will you call the medicinal\r\nthe mercenary art, if, in performing a cure, one earns a reward? No,\r\nsaid he.”\r\n\r\n_The Founding of Alexandria._--Alexander the Great, after subduing\r\nthe Persians and the cities of Phoenicia, marched into Egypt and\r\nfounded (331 B. C.), at the mouth of the Nile, the city of Alexandria.\r\nIn October of the same year he crossed the Euphrates and the Tigris\r\nand defeated, for the second time, the Persian hosts under Darius.\r\nAlexander was now the conqueror of Asia. During the following eight\r\nyears he laid his plans most carefully for the consolidation of his\r\ngreat empire, the capital of which was to have been Babylon; but,\r\nwhile he was thus making provision for the welfare of his numerous\r\nsubjects, who were of widely different tastes and aspirations, he\r\nsuccumbed (323 B. C.) to a severe attack of malarial fever, aggravated\r\nby an excessive indulgence in wine on the occasion of some festivity.\r\nIn the meantime Alexandria was developing rapidly into a great centre\r\nof learning in all the departments of human knowledge. The Ptolemies,\r\nbeginning with Ptolemy Soter, who reigned over Egypt from 323 to 285\r\nB. C., contributed greatly to this result. For a period of about 250\r\nyears Alexandria remained the centre around which revolved all that was\r\nbest in the domains of medicine, philosophy, geometry, mathematics,\r\nhistory, etc. Money was spent lavishly in collecting the writings of\r\nall those authors who had distinguished themselves in these different\r\nfields of learning, and no pains were spared to secure correct\r\nversions of the different works; the septuagint version of the books of\r\nthe Old Testament of the Bible being a conspicuous example of what the\r\nPtolemies accomplished in this direction during the third century B.\r\nC. Every possible facility was offered at the same time for the giving\r\nand receiving of instruction; and thus, with the immense library as a\r\nfoundation of priceless value, the Museum at Alexandria became in every\r\nmaterial respect a great university, the first one of which history\r\ngives us any fairly satisfactory information. Several years after\r\nthe Museum library was established a second one of somewhat smaller\r\nproportions was organized in the Serapeum (Temple of Serapis). The\r\nexample set by the Ptolemies was followed by Attalus, King of Pergamum\r\nin Mysia, Asia Minor (241 B. C.), and, before many years had elapsed,\r\nthe great library of that city almost rivaled those of the Museum and\r\nSerapeum at Alexandria. It was the competition between these two royal\r\ncollectors of books that led to the issuing of a decree that no more\r\npapyrus was to be exported from Egypt, and thus there was provided the\r\nstimulus which led to the discovery or invention of a new and better\r\nmaterial on which books might be written--viz., Pergamentum (our\r\nparchment), a word coined from the name of the city in which it was\r\ninvented.\r\n\r\n_The Development of Different Sects or Schools of Medicine._--Up\r\nto the time of the death of Hippocrates medicine maintained the\r\ncharacter of a single organized and harmonious body; but, when this\r\ngreat physician had disappeared from the scene and was no longer\r\nthere to guide the further development of medical science and to keep\r\nhis followers working shoulder to shoulder with a single spirit and\r\npurpose, this hitherto homogeneous body split up into sects or schools,\r\neach of which had some favorite doctrine the promulgation of which\r\nseemed to each group of adherents to be of great importance. There\r\nwere at first two such principal groups, viz., the Dogmatics and the\r\nEmpirics. The former was composed of those who laid great stress upon\r\nspeculation or theorizing,--that is, upon the use of the reasoning\r\npower,--and the latter of men who maintained that actual experience was\r\nthe only thing of any serious value. The respective leaders of these\r\ntwo groups or sects were Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nIn Raphael’s celebrated painting, “The School of Athens,” these two\r\nheroes of philosophy are represented standing side by side--Plato with\r\nhis right hand elevated and pointing toward heaven, while Aristotle is\r\nlooking distinctly at the earth. Pictorially, the tendencies of the two\r\nschools of philosophy could not have been better represented. Plato’s\r\ngenius had taken its flight heavenward and was contemplating earthly\r\nthings from this point of vantage; his method being to ignore system\r\nand to look at everything with the eyes of purest love. “Delightfully\r\npoetic, but thoroughly unprofitable speculation as to what constitutes\r\nscientific truth and perfected morality!” (Friedlaender.)\r\n\r\nAristotle, whose father was a physician and a descendant of\r\nAesculapius, was the hero and guiding spirit of those who based their\r\nphilosophy on experience, on ascertained facts. Like his celebrated\r\npupil, Alexander the Great, who brought whole nations under his sway,\r\nhe too was a conqueror in every field of human knowledge. His ideas\r\nruled supreme over the minds of men for thousands of years and to-day,\r\nalthough many of them are no longer accepted as valid, Aristotle\r\nhimself is universally held to have been the greatest thinker and\r\ninvestigator who has ever lived upon this earth. (In chapter XIII. I\r\nshall have occasion to say something further regarding the Dogmatics\r\nand the Empirics.)\r\n\r\nOut of the teachings of Plato and Aristotle developed two schools of\r\nphilosophy that exerted, in course of time, a great influence upon\r\nthe minds of men and upon the growth of medical science. The schools\r\nreferred to are the Epicureans and the Stoics. Epicurus (242–270 B.\r\nC.), who gave his name to the first of these, taught that the highest\r\ngood was happiness.\r\n\r\n   The happiness he taught his followers to seek was not sensual\r\n   enjoyment, but peace of mind as the result of the cultivation\r\n   of all the virtues. According to the teaching of his school\r\n   virtue should be practiced _because_ it leads to happiness;\r\n   whereas the Stoics taught that virtue should be cultivated for\r\n   her own sake, irrespective of the happiness it will ensure. Zeno\r\n   (circa 370–260 B. C.), the founder of the Stoic philosophy,\r\n   taught an ethical system according to which virtue consists in\r\n   absolute judgment, absolute mastery of desire, absolute control\r\n   of the soul over pain, and absolute justice. The keynote of the\r\n   system is _duty_, as that of Epicureanism is pleasure. (Sir\r\n   William Smith.)\r\n\r\nIn addition to the sects named above, there was still another known\r\nas the Older Dogmatic School, which was composed of men who had\r\nbeen the direct followers of the great master, but who, forgetting\r\naltogether the practical teachings of Hippocrates with regard to\r\nthe importance of experience, gave themselves up to all sorts of\r\nhypotheses and theories. Among the names of the earliest followers of\r\nthis school one is astonished to find those of Thessalus and Draco,\r\nthe sons of Hippocrates, as well as the name of Polybus, the latter’s\r\nson-in-law. Diocles of Carystos and Praxagoras of Cos, two of the most\r\ndistinguished men of that period, were also among the earliest members\r\nof this dogmatic school. Diocles, who was one of the Asclepiadae, owed\r\nhis celebrity in part to his contributions to our knowledge of anatomy\r\nand in part to the work which he had done in other departments of\r\nmedicine. Unfortunately, all of these writings have been lost with the\r\nexception of a few fragments which came to light toward the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century. Praxagoras was also one of the Asclepiadae. He\r\nwas distinguished, as has already been stated on an earlier page, by\r\nthe fact that he--and not Aristotle, as is sometimes stated--was first\r\nto recognize the difference between arteries and veins, and also by\r\nthe further fact that he called attention to the practical value of\r\nthe pulse as an indication, in certain diseases, of the tone of the\r\npatient’s bodily condition or vitality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    ERASISTRATUS AND HEROPHILUS, THE TWO GREAT LEADERS IN MEDICINE\r\n               AT ALEXANDRIA; THE FOUNDING OF NEW SECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo of the most celebrated physicians of that period (305–280 B. C.)\r\nwere Erasistratus and Herophilus, both of whom were distinguished\r\nas the founders of schools or sects of medicine at Alexandria. They\r\nhad received their early training as physicians from Chrysippus, a\r\nwidely known Stoic philosopher, who, according to Albert von Haller,\r\nhad taught at the school of Cnidus and had also written on medical\r\ntopics; and, among the other teachers, it is stated that Anaxagoras\r\nof Cos had instructed Herophilus, and that Metrodorus, the son-in-law\r\nof Aristotle, had performed the same service for Erasistratus. So far\r\nas fundamental principles are concerned, the schools founded by these\r\ntwo physicians at Alexandria differed very little from each other, and\r\nthe men themselves also gained their distinction in very much the same\r\nbranches of medical knowledge, both of them having made a number of\r\noriginal discoveries in anatomy and both of them having become eminent\r\npractitioners.\r\n\r\nHerophilus was born at Chalcedon, a Greek city on the Propontus,\r\nnearly opposite to Byzantium. We possess no knowledge whatever\r\nregarding the earlier years of his career, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat no fewer than four different men devoted their energies to the\r\nwriting of his biography. The books themselves have been either lost\r\nor destroyed. Herophilus showed a decided leaning toward the study\r\nof anatomy, and his contributions to this branch of medicine are\r\namong the earliest which we possess. Herophilus strove to supply one\r\nof the most conspicuous deficiencies in the Hippocratic system of\r\nmedicine, viz., inadequate knowledge of the nervous system; and to\r\nthis end he conducted a series of the most careful investigations,\r\nas a result of which he was successful in establishing several facts\r\npreviously unknown. He described the membranes of the brain, the\r\nchoroid plexus, the venous sinuses, the structure which bears his\r\nname,--the torcular Herophili,--the cerebral ventricles, and the\r\ncalamus scriptorius; he traced the course of the nerve trunks for some\r\ndistance from their origin in the brain and spinal cord; and it was he\r\nwho established the fact that two different sets of nerves exist--one\r\nfor conveying sensations to the brain and the other for producing\r\nmotion. In addition, he investigated the corpus vitreum, the retina,\r\nthe optic nerve, etc. He also called attention to the peculiar mode\r\nof construction of the duodenum, and to the fact that the walls of\r\nthe arteries are thicker than those of the veins. Some idea of the\r\naccurate manner in which he carried on his anatomical researches may be\r\ngained from the fact that he noted the circumstance that the left vena\r\nspermatica occasionally originates in the vena renalis.\r\n\r\nHerophilus also gained distinction in the practical branches of\r\nmedicine. According to Puschmann he laid the foundations for a\r\nscientific sphygmography. Thus he distinguished several varieties\r\nof pulse in accordance with the differences which he noted in its\r\nstrength, regularity, degree of fulness, and rate of speed. He also\r\nmust have had considerable experience in surgery, as is shown by his\r\nremark that a dislocation of the thigh, owing to the tearing of the\r\nligamentum teres which necessarily accompanies such a dislocation, is\r\nlikely to occur again in the same individual. In his writings relating\r\nto the practice of medicine, Herophilus upheld the principle that\r\nexperience alone should be our guide, as theoretical considerations are\r\nnot to be trusted. He is also credited with having said, in response to\r\nthe question, Whom do you consider the best physician? “Him who knows\r\nhow to distinguish what is attainable from what is unattainable.”\r\n\r\nErasistratus, the contemporary of Herophilus and his associate in the\r\nwork of establishing at Alexandria a great anatomical and clinical\r\nmedical school, was a native of Julis, in the Island of Ceos, not far\r\nfrom the coast of Attica. In the earlier part of his professional\r\ncareer he spent some time at the Court of Seleucus, the founder of the\r\nSyrian monarchy (312–280 B. C.). This monarch, who had been one of\r\nAlexander the Great’s distinguished generals, consigned the government\r\nof the eastern part of his vast kingdom to his son Antiochus. The\r\nlatter fell ill about this time, and the most distinguished physicians\r\nof the Court were then called in to determine what was the nature of\r\nhis malady and to decide upon the proper treatment. The patient grew\r\nmore and more languid, showed complete indifference to all that took\r\nplace about him, and steadily lost flesh. Erasistratus, who was one of\r\nthe physicians summoned, observed his behavior very closely and soon\r\nnoted the fact that, whenever Stratonice, his young and attractive\r\nstepmother, entered the sick room, Antiochus became agitated; his face\r\nbeing flushed, his voice subdued, his pulse more rapid, and his eyes\r\nbrighter, all of which signs of excitement disappeared when Stratonice\r\nleft the room. From these phenomena this shrewd observer drew the\r\ninference that the patient was deeply but hopelessly in love with his\r\nfather’s second wife. Accordingly he informed Seleucus that his son’s\r\nillness was simply the result of having lost his heart to one who was\r\nunable to return his affection. Seleucus, who was much astonished,\r\nasked with deep interest who was the lady. “My wife,” replied\r\nErasistratus, without an instant’s hesitation. “But tell me then,”\r\nasked Seleucus, “would you be willing to cause the death of my son,\r\nwho is so very dear to me, by refusing to give up your wife to him?”\r\n“Would you, yourself, my lord, under similar circumstances,” replied\r\nthe physician, “be willing to give up Stratonice to the Prince, if it\r\nhad been she with whom he had fallen in love?” Seleucus having already\r\nvowed that he would not hesitate for a moment to do so, Erasistratus\r\ndeclared the whole truth to him, and of course there was nothing left\r\nfor the King but to keep his word. History fails to state whether or\r\nnot the lady made any objection to the transfer. As Antiochus lived\r\nto reign for many years after the murder of his father, it is safe to\r\nassume that he recovered his health.\r\n\r\nThis brief tale, the truth of which is not disputed by any of the\r\nauthorities, reveals Erasistratus to have been a clever diagnostician,\r\nto have possessed a profound knowledge of human nature, and to have\r\nbeen a man of exceptional courage; in short, he was a physician\r\nadmirably fitted to act as the founder and leader of one of the two\r\ngreat medical schools of Alexandria. The following account may suffice\r\nto convey some idea of his career after he became established at the\r\nlatter city.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his residence in Alexandria, Erasistratus, like\r\nhis great rival Herophilus, devoted his energies to anatomical and\r\nphysiological researches. These two men evidently realized to the full\r\nhow important it was to medicine, if it were to make a substantial\r\nadvance beyond the point to which Hippocrates and his followers had\r\nalready carried it, that a more complete understanding of the structure\r\nand working of the human body should be obtained; and their efforts\r\nin this direction were greatly aided by the enlightened views of the\r\nkings of Egypt, the Ptolemies, who did everything in their power to\r\nfurnish these two investigators with all the human dissecting material\r\nthey could use to advantage. They even went so far as to allow them\r\nthe privilege of utilizing, for scientific purposes, the living bodies\r\nof imprisoned criminals, “in order that they might in this way learn\r\nthe location, color, shape, size, construction, hardness, softness,\r\nsmoothness, nature of external surface, protuberances and recesses of\r\nthe individual organs during life.” The defense which they offered for\r\npermitting such vivisections was this: “It is permissible to sacrifice\r\nthe lives of a few criminals if many worthy persons may thereby be\r\npermanently benefited in health, or have their lives prolonged.”\r\n(Puschmann.) Those who were opposed to such examinations upon human\r\nbeings expressed their disapproval in the following terms: “This\r\npractice is not only cruel, but useless, and at the same time it\r\nderogates from the dignity of the healing art, which is intended to\r\nbe a blessing and not a source of pain to man; for those in whom the\r\nabdominal cavity is first opened and then the diaphragm divided, die\r\nbefore it is possible to make the scientific examination ‘during life’\r\nwhich constitutes, as it is claimed, the justification for the entire\r\nprocedure.” (Puschmann.)\r\n\r\nAs regards the work done by Erasistratus in the departments of anatomy\r\nand physiology, the following statement may be made: He threw a great\r\ndeal of additional light upon the structure of the lacteals, the valves\r\nof the heart, the brain, the nerves, and several other portions of the\r\nbody; and he assigned to the pneuma, or breath,--of which he assumed\r\nthat two kinds exist,--the most important rôle in the mechanism of\r\nlife. According to the description given by Galen and reported by Le\r\nClerc, the phenomena to which Erasistratus refers take place somewhat\r\nas follows: “When the thorax or chest expands, the lungs also undergo\r\ndilatation and fill themselves with air. This air, entering first by\r\nway of the trachea, ultimately reaches the anastomosing terminals of\r\nthe bronchial tubes, from which locality the heart, by the act of\r\ndilatation, draws it into itself, and then, immediately afterward\r\ncontracting, sends it, by way of the great artery (the Aorta), to every\r\npart of the body.” When it is considered that at this remote period\r\nof time nothing was known about oxygen and carbon dioxide, nor about\r\nthe power of these elements to pass freely through a thin membrane\r\n(exosmosis and endosmosis), no surprise will be felt that Erasistratus\r\ncarried the physiology of respiration no farther than he did. On the\r\ncontrary, it is remarkable that he was able to describe so correctly\r\nthis complicated process. In fact, none of his successors, up to the\r\ntime when Harvey’s great discovery was announced, was able to furnish\r\na better description. The physiology of gastric digestion was another\r\nof the problems concerning which Erasistratus held views that were\r\ndifferent from those commonly accepted by the physicians of that time.\r\nThe stomach, he maintained, first retracts when portions of food are\r\nintroduced and then contracts in such a manner as to break them up into\r\nsmaller and smaller fragments; this process taking the place of that\r\nof “coction,” as taught by Hippocrates. The resulting chyle passes\r\nfrom the stomach into the liver and is deposited in those spots where\r\nthe finer branches of the vena cava and the terminal twigs of the\r\nchannels which lead into the gall-bladder come together. Here the chyle\r\nbreaks up into two portions, one of which--viz., that which contains\r\nbiliary elements--gains an entrance into the channels that lead to the\r\ngall-bladder, while the other, which is composed of elements suitable\r\nfor making pure blood, finds its way into the ramifications of the\r\nvena cava. While holding these views about the mode of transformation\r\nof gastric chyle into the bile and pure blood, Erasistratus did not\r\nhesitate to confess that he was unable to say whether bile was produced\r\nwithin the body or whether it already existed in the food that was\r\ntaken into the stomach.\r\n\r\nAs regards the treatment of disease Erasistratus held certain views\r\nwhich were decidedly at variance with those maintained by the majority\r\nof his associates. Thus, for example, Straton, a distinguished disciple\r\nof this master, praises him for having banished bloodletting from the\r\nlist of remedial measures, and adds that he can testify to the fact\r\nthat Erasistratus had, by other means, cured all the diseases in which\r\nthe ancients commonly employed bloodletting as the chief remedial\r\nagent. His favorite substitutes for the latter procedure were fasting,\r\ndieting, physical exercise, and--in cases of hemorrhage--placing\r\nligatures around the arms and legs. Caelius Aurelianus is authority for\r\nthe statement that, in certain very exceptional cases, Erasistratus did\r\nresort to bloodletting. Another of the latter’s tenets was his strong\r\nobjection to the employment of purgatives and composite remedies. On\r\nthe other hand, he appears to have attached considerable importance\r\nto the employment of chicory in the treatment of all disorders of the\r\nabdominal organs. One of the evidences of his preference for this\r\ndrug is to be found in the care which he takes in describing how the\r\nplant should be prepared for remedial purposes. “Boil a bunch of the\r\nplant in water until the mass is thoroughly cooked; then cast it into\r\na fresh supply of boiling water (to drive out still more of its bitter\r\nquality); and finally, upon removing it from the boiling water, place\r\nit for conservation in a receptacle containing oil. When it is required\r\nfor use add a small quantity of weak vinegar.” Galen, in commenting\r\njocosely upon the stress which Erasistratus lays upon these details,\r\nmakes the remark: “As if our domestics did not know how to cook a bunch\r\nof chicory!”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the effects produced by venom when one is bitten by a\r\npoisonous snake, Erasistratus remarks that “from the effects which the\r\npoison introduced in this manner produces, we may derive a general\r\nindication as to how a cure may be obtained. The poison, it will be\r\nnoted, destroys very quickly the parts with which it comes in contact,\r\nand then, by spreading throughout the body, causes death. The thing to\r\ndo, therefore, is to draw it as quickly as possible out of the body\r\nand thus arrest its further spread. To this end the wound should first\r\nbe enlarged and its sides scarified; then, after it has been sucked,\r\na cupping glass should be applied over it; and, finally, it should be\r\ncauterized.”\r\n\r\nErasistratus cultivated surgery as well as the other branches of\r\nmedicine. He was a bold operator, as may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat, in cases of scirrhus or other variety of tumor of the liver, he\r\ndid not hesitate to incise the skin and overlying integuments, and\r\nthen, after the peritoneal cavity had been opened, to apply directly to\r\nthe seat of the disease such medicaments as seemed to him appropriate.\r\nOn the other hand, he did not approve of _paracentesis abdominis_\r\nin cases of dropsical effusion, as a means of evacuating the fluid\r\naccumulated in the peritoneal cavity.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the disciples and successors of Herophilus and\r\nErasistratus soon abandoned the exact methods which these two great\r\nmasters had inaugurated and which, in a comparatively short time, had\r\nproduced such admirable results, and then they fell back into the\r\nless arduous, the easy-going ways of speculation. Only a very few had\r\nsufficient strength of character to walk in the older pathway, and\r\namong the number were some who left Alexandria and established schools\r\nin the other cities--as, for example, Zeuxis, who organized a new\r\ncentre of medical teaching at Laodicea, in the interior of Asia Minor,\r\nand Hikesios, who founded another school at Smyrna, on the seacoast of\r\nLydia. It is not strange, therefore, that before many years had elapsed\r\nthe two original schools at Alexandria died a natural death. As Pliny\r\naptly writes, “It was so much more comfortable to sit on the benches\r\nof the schools and have learning poured into your ears than to wander\r\ndaily through the desert outside in search of other nourishing plants.”\r\nAs a further result of this deadness of the schools at Alexandria (that\r\nis, of the sect of the Dogmatics) the more serious-minded physicians\r\nespoused with eagerness the side of the Empirics--a sect which\r\ndeveloped about this time, but which did not, it must be confessed,\r\nhold out much hope of solving the physiological and pathological\r\nproblems of the day, but which nevertheless satisfied in some measure\r\ntheir needs as practitioners.\r\n\r\nPhilinus of Cos (286 B. C.) was looked upon as the founder of the\r\nschool of the Empirics, and among its most distinguished disciples\r\nwere: Serapion of Alexandria (279 B. C.), Glaucias, Apollonius\r\nBiblas, and--perhaps the most celebrated of them all--Herakleides of\r\nTarentum (242 B. C.), who did such excellent work in the department\r\nof pharmacology. It was he, for example, who defined more precisely\r\nthan had been done by any one of his predecessors the proper manner\r\nof employing opium. In addition, he wrote a commentary on the\r\nHippocratic works and also separate treatises on medical, surgical\r\nand pharmaceutical topics. In the latter category belongs his book\r\nentitled “A Military Pharmacopoeia.” Last of all, Apollonius Mus, a\r\ndistinguished follower of Herophilus, deserves to be mentioned because\r\nit was he who perfected the preparation of castor oil. At a still later\r\ndate (158 B. C.) Zopyrus proved himself to be a most worthy successor\r\nto Herakleides. It was he who first classified drugs according to the\r\neffects which they produce, and he also invented or discovered the\r\npreparation named “ambrosia,” a general antidote for poisons of all\r\nkinds. Kings and princes were, at that period, in constant fear of\r\nbeing poisoned, and so it came about that those who were skilled in the\r\nknowledge and preparation of drugs were greatly stimulated by their\r\nroyal patrons to find efficient antidotes. It is narrated that Attalus\r\nPhilometer, King of Pergamum, the native city of the famous physician\r\nGalen, and Mithridates Eupator, King of Pontus, cultivated poisonous\r\nplants in their gardens and tried the effects of the poisons distilled\r\nfrom them on criminals. They also encouraged in every possible way\r\nthe preparation of antidotes; and thus was compounded a mixture which\r\neven to-day is still known by the name of “_Mithridaticum_.” For\r\ncenturies it was a very popular remedy for poisoning by snake-bite. Le\r\nClerc states that one of the first things that the great Roman general\r\nPompey did, after conquering Mithridates and gaining possession of his\r\npalace (about 64 B. C.), was to have a careful search made for the\r\nrecipe of this famous antidote. Upon finding it he was surprised to\r\nlearn what simple ingredients it was composed of--viz., “20 leaves of\r\nrue, a pinch of salt, two nuts, and two dried figs.” The theriacum,\r\nwhich one hundred years later was modeled after the Mithridaticum,\r\ncontained a great deal of honey and a large number of unimportant\r\ndrugs, introduced--as Pliny claims--“to magnify the importance of the\r\napothecary’s art, rather than to increase the curative effects of the\r\nremedy.”\r\n\r\nThe scepticism which already at that period had begun to take\r\npossession of many of the best minds manifested itself in the form of\r\na disbelief in the possibility of discovering full scientific truth,\r\nand men therefore taught the doctrine that the human understanding\r\nis not capable of attaining anything higher than probability. The\r\nacceptance of such a doctrine naturally acted as a powerful hindrance\r\nto all further original research. And so the Empirics neglected the\r\nstudy of anatomy and physiology as something quite superfluous and\r\nunprofitable. They gave no further thought to the causes of disease,\r\nand were quite satisfied simply to observe its manifestations, to\r\ninvestigate the factors which appeared to bring it into a state of\r\nactivity, and to search for the means of effecting a cure. In carrying\r\non work of this character, they of course derived help, not only from\r\ntheir own experience, but also from that of others--which latter became\r\nin time a matter of history. When they encountered new experiences\r\nand were unable to supply a satisfactory explanation they resorted\r\nto a third method--that of reasoning by analogy. Upon this triple\r\nsupport--one’s own individual experience, the experience of others\r\nstored up in the form of history, and reasoning by analogy--rested the\r\nentire structure of empiricism.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may at first appear, the science of medicine from this\r\ntime onward made no further conspicuous progress until the middle of\r\nthe seventeenth century of the present era. In certain branches of\r\npractical medicine--as, for example, pharmacology, obstetrics and\r\ngeneral surgery, and also in certain special departments--the Empirics\r\nmade a number of material additions to our knowledge; but in all\r\nessential particulars the medical science taught throughout this period\r\nof about two thousand years varied but little from that taught at\r\nAlexandria one hundred or two hundred years before the birth of Christ.\r\nThis extraordinary phenomenon of almost complete arrest of development\r\nfor so long a period of time should not excite surprise, for something\r\nof a similar nature has certainly occurred in other departments of\r\nhuman knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe further history of the medical sects which flourished under the\r\nPtolemies and for a short time afterward, when Alexandria became\r\na colony of the Roman Empire, need not detain us long. Daremberg\r\nfurnishes a chronological chart of the physicians who played a more\r\nor less prominent part in the work of these sects, and from this\r\nit appears that they numbered thirty-four in all--ten followers of\r\nHerophilus, fourteen of Erasistratus, and ten Empirics. Callamachur\r\nand Bacchius, who belonged to the first of these groups, deserve to be\r\nmentioned because they were its most distinguished members and because\r\nthey were the first physicians who wrote commentaries on the writings\r\nof Hippocrates. In the sect of the Empirics the next in importance\r\nafter Philinus of Cos is Serapion of Alexandria. Mantias, another\r\ndisciple of Herophilus, gained considerable reputation from the fact\r\nthat he was the first to collect together into a single treatise the\r\ndifferent pharmaceutical formulae that were then in general use. He was\r\nalso an authoritative writer on surgical topics.\r\n\r\n_Certain Branches of Medical Work Begin to Assume more Distinctly\r\nthe Character of Specialties._--At the time of Hippocrates there\r\nwere no specialists, or at least none who received any sort of official\r\nrecognition from the general body of physicians; and yet, there were,\r\neven then, a few practitioners who devoted themselves preferably to\r\nthe treatment of certain maladies, like the affections of the eye and\r\nthe teeth; and, beside these, there were undoubtedly, in the larger\r\ncommunities, men who were ready and competent to undertake the more\r\nserious surgical operations. But even these men, as appears from the\r\nlanguage of the so-called Hippocratic oath, could not honorably perform\r\nan operation for stone in the bladder; this particular work having been\r\nleft from time immemorial entirely in the hands of the lithotomists, a\r\nclass of men who performed no other kind of surgery and who, in fact,\r\nwere considered outside the pale of the medical profession--merely\r\nsurgical artisans.\r\n\r\nDuring the Alexandrian period the attitude of the best physicians with\r\nreference to specialization in medical practice evidently underwent\r\na change,--not a very marked one, it is true, but yet sufficient\r\nin degree to attract some attention. We read, for example, that a\r\ncertain Demetrius of Apamea, a follower of Herophilus, was skilled\r\nas an obstetrician and was also a clever diagnostician; that Andreas\r\nof Carystus, another disciple of Herophilus and the physician upon\r\nwhose authority the incredible story of the burning of the Cnidian\r\narchives by Hippocrates was spread abroad, was considered at this\r\ntime an expert in the science of obstetrics; that, toward the end of\r\nthe period (first century B. C.), Alexander Philalethes, a disciple\r\nof Herophilus and well known as an author of treatises on the pulse\r\nand on the doctrines taught by different physicians of that period,\r\nacquired widespread celebrity as a gynaecologist; that Straton, a\r\ndisciple of Erasistratus, had gained considerable distinction as a\r\ngynaecologist; and, finally, that two physicians--Gaius of Naples and\r\nDemosthenes of Marseilles (Massilia)--were widely celebrated for their\r\nskilfulness in the treatment of eye diseases. The latter was also a\r\nsuccessful author, for his treatise on ophthalmology retained its\r\npopularity down to the Middle Ages. All these men, it should be noted,\r\nwere directly and indirectly connected with the work at Alexandria, and\r\nwere physicians of some degree of prominence. It is fair to assume,\r\ntherefore, that specialization in medical practice had by this time\r\nbecome an accepted fact and was certainly not frowned upon by those in\r\nauthority. The result is entirely in accord with what might be expected\r\nfrom a body of physicians as enlightened as were the men gathered\r\ntogether at Alexandria during the centuries immediately preceding and\r\nthat immediately following the birth of Christ; but many additional\r\ncenturies were yet to elapse before anything like the well-defined\r\nspecialism of modern times was to become an established fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n        ASCLEPIADES, THE INTRODUCER OF GREEK MEDICINE INTO ROME\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventh Ptolemy, Ptolemy Euergetes or Physcon, whose reign lasted\r\nfrom 146 to 117 B. C., drove all men of learning away from Alexandria\r\nand closed the famous schools in that city. It was only a few years\r\nafter these events, and at a time when that city was fast losing its\r\nsupremacy as the great centre of medical learning,[27] that there\r\nappeared at Rome a Greek philosopher and physician who was destined to\r\nbecome the founder of a new set of medical ideas and of a new kind of\r\nmedical practice. Being a man of general cultivation and attractive\r\npersonality, and not afraid to encounter the prejudices and ill will\r\nwhich almost always greet a foreigner when he first establishes himself\r\nin a strange country and among a people of a different race, he soon\r\novercame those obstacles and was eventually successful in making Rome\r\nthe starting-point and centre of the best medical thought and practice\r\nof that period of the world’s history. To understand clearly, however,\r\nthe character of the work which Asclepiades accomplished in the city\r\nwhich was soon to be the capital of the world as then known, it is\r\ndesirable that a brief account should be given of the condition of\r\nmedical affairs in Rome at the time of his arrival.\r\n\r\n_The Practice of Medicine at Rome During the Century Immediately\r\nPreceding the Christian Era._--Foreigners were not encouraged to\r\nsettle in Rome until toward the latter part of the second century B.\r\nC., and consequently the treatment of the sick in that city maintained\r\nits distinctly Roman character for an unusually long time. In the\r\nhouseholds of the better classes the head of the family commonly\r\nprescribed for any illness which might befall its members. In not a few\r\ninstances one of the slaves--who was known as a _servus medicus_,\r\nand who might perfectly well have been a regularly educated Greek\r\nphysician--took charge of the patient in place of the master of the\r\nhouse. A book of domestic remedies was the usual source of information\r\nfrom which the latter derived his knowledge of therapeutics. Marcus\r\nPorcius Cato, the distinguished Roman censor (234–149 B. C.), was the\r\nauthor of one of the most popular of these books of recipes. The text\r\nof this work has come down to our time. There were, at this period,\r\nno regularly established physicians and no such thing as a medical\r\npractice. For several hundred years the Romans were almost constantly\r\nat war with the neighboring tribes or nations, and this life of\r\noutdoor exposure and active exercise kept them free from the numerous\r\nand very varied bodily ills of the later generations. This state of\r\nsociety alone was quite sufficient to prevent the thoroughly trained\r\nphysicians of Greece and Alexandria from settling in Rome. But there\r\nwere still other forces at work which greatly delayed their taking\r\nsuch a step, viz., the unwillingness on the part of the authorities\r\nto grant to foreigners the rights of citizenship, and the very strong\r\nprejudice which the Roman aristocracy cherished with regard to the\r\nGreek nation. Some idea of the strength of the latter feeling may\r\nbe gathered from the letter which Cato the Censor, perhaps the most\r\ninfluential citizen of Rome at that time, wrote to his son Marcus.\r\nDaremberg gives the following quotation from this epistle: “The Greeks\r\nare a perverse and unteachable race. Believe that an oracle is speaking\r\nto you when I say--Every time that the Greeks bring to us some branch\r\nof knowledge they will not fail to corrupt our manners; and it will\r\nbe far worse for us if they should send us their physicians, for they\r\nhave bound themselves by an oath to kill all Barbarians by the aid of\r\nmedicine--and they have the insolence to reckon us also as Barbarians.\r\nRemember that I have forbidden you to call in a physician.” Daremberg\r\nadds: “The old man Cato must have been very simple-minded to believe\r\nfor a moment that physicians would be such egregious fools as willingly\r\nto kill the patients from whom they derive their support.” But even\r\nthis strong prejudice on the part of the Roman aristocracy had to\r\ngive way in course of time to forces of a much stronger character.\r\nDuring the second century B. C., the Romans, no longer fearing the\r\nencroachments of their warlike neighbors and having overcome all danger\r\nof an invasion on the part of their once powerful Carthaginian foe,\r\nentered upon a career of conquest. The capture of an ever increasing\r\nnumber of cities and towns in Greece, Asia Minor, Egypt and Africa\r\nbrought great wealth to Rome, and, with it, increasing luxury, an\r\nincrease in the prevalence and variety of diseases, and an increased\r\nneed of men who were competent to deal successfully with such diseases.\r\nThe physicians who first attempted to meet this need were men of an\r\ninferior stamp, to whom the situation appeared simply to afford an\r\nexcellent opportunity for making money; and very naturally they failed\r\nto gain the respect and confidence of the better citizens. At a later\r\ndate Julius Caesar, who was, at that time, Consul (about 90 B. C.),\r\nextended the right of citizenship to all foreign physicians who were\r\npracticing in Rome, and thus was removed one of the greatest obstacles\r\nwhich prevented the better class of Greek medical men from settling in\r\nthat city.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred years before the time of which I am speaking\r\n(_i.e._, about 218 B. C.), a Greek physician named Archagathus had\r\nthe courage to take up his abode in Rome. He was the son of Lysanias,\r\na native of Peloponnesus. At first he appeared to gain the favor of\r\nthe community in which he practiced, for they bought and placed at his\r\ndisposal a shop, or office, in the cross-way of Acilius, and gave him\r\nthe name of _vulnerarius_--healer of wounds. Later, however, they\r\ndisliked his rather too free use of the knife and the actual cautery,\r\nand thereafter he was spoken of as the _carnifex_, or executioner.\r\nMedicine was thus brought into disrepute and we hear nothing further\r\nabout physicians in Rome for more than a century--that is, until about\r\n90 B. C., when Asclepiades,[28] a native of the city of Prusa, Bithynia\r\n(northwest part of Asia Minor), made his appearance in that city. At\r\nfirst he taught rhetoric, but, finding this occupation unprofitable, he\r\nbegan the practice of medicine. Pliny says that he acquired a knowledge\r\nof this art through the studies which he carried on after his arrival\r\nin the city of Rome, but Neuburger makes the statement that he began\r\nthe study of rhetoric, philosophy and medicine in his youth and then\r\nspent some time in perfecting his knowledge at Parion, a city of Mysia\r\non the Hellespont, at Athens, and probably also at Alexandria.\r\n\r\nAs a practitioner Asclepiades appears to have met with unusual success.\r\nHe was well educated and possessed of agreeable manners, and was the\r\nfriend as well as the physician of Cicero, one of the most polished\r\nmen of whom history furnishes us any knowledge. He was also on terms\r\nof intimacy with Atticus and other eminent citizens of Rome. The\r\npossession of such friends was more than sufficient to render him one\r\nof the favored and prosperous physicians of his day in that city. As\r\nMeyer-Steineg aptly says, “he owed not a little of his success to the\r\nhappy manner in which the scientist, the clever physician, and--to\r\na slight degree--the charlatan were combined in his character.” The\r\nfollowing anecdote which is told of him by Lucius Apuleius shows, on\r\nthe one hand, that he possessed remarkably keen powers of observation,\r\nand, on the other, that there were some grounds for the charge that his\r\nbehavior was at times somewhat theatrical in character:--\r\n\r\n   One day, as Asclepiades was returning to the city, from his\r\n   place in the country, he observed the approach of a long funeral\r\n   procession. Desiring to learn whether the deceased was a person\r\n   of his acquaintance, and also in the hope of perhaps gaining\r\n   other information of a professional nature, he approached as\r\n   nearly as possible to the bier. The face of the corpse was\r\n   anointed with sweet-smelling ointments over which spices had\r\n   been sprinkled; but, notwithstanding this, he was able to detect\r\n   certain signs which led him to suspect that the man might not\r\n   yet be dead; and accordingly he examined the body very closely\r\n   and thus satisfied himself that such was indeed the fact.\r\n   Whereupon he called aloud that the man was still alive, and\r\n   told the bearers to extinguish the torches, to carry away the\r\n   materials for the pyre, and to remove the funeral feast from\r\n   the grave to a table. Some at once objected to the carrying\r\n   out of these measures and made sarcastic remarks about the\r\n   healing art--probably because they were already in possession\r\n   of the man’s estate, and were afraid that they might have to\r\n   give it up. The more influential ones, however, insisted that\r\n   the physician’s words should be heeded. Then Asclepiades,\r\n   notwithstanding the opposition which was made by the relatives,\r\n   succeeded in securing a brief delay, during which he had the\r\n   supposed corpse removed to his own house. Restorative measures\r\n   were employed, respiration was re-established, and the man was\r\n   brought back to life. At the succeeding festivities unlimited\r\n   praise was bestowed upon the wise physician.\r\n\r\nWhether this tale, which I have copied from Neuburger, is true or\r\nnot, it seems to fit in well with the bold and independent character\r\nof Asclepiades as it is revealed to us by the different writers of\r\nthe history of medicine. In his comment upon this narrative the\r\ndistinguished Viennese historian makes the remark that Asclepiades\r\nwas very conceited, and--like most reformers--showed a disposition to\r\nignore the work accomplished by his predecessors. He also expresses the\r\nbelief that Asclepiades possessed a leaning toward the methods of the\r\ncharlatan; the episode just narrated revealing a love for theatrical\r\ndisplay in his professional activity. On the other hand, in the further\r\ncourse of the chapter which he devotes to this famous Roman physician,\r\nNeuburger gives fuller recognition to the value of the services which\r\nhe rendered to medicine, and thus, in the light of these services, one\r\nis justified in overlooking any little weaknesses of character which he\r\nmay have displayed. Perhaps the most important of the services which\r\nAsclepiades rendered was that of having introduced Greek medicine into\r\nRome--an important connecting link in the transmission of medical\r\nknowledge from Greece to Modern Europe.\r\n\r\n_The Views of Asclepiades with Regard to Physiology and\r\nPathology._--The human body, according to the philosophy of\r\nAsclepiades, is composed of atoms--that is, small bodies which are\r\ninvisible, have no definable quality, are in continual motion, through\r\nmutual pressure undergo modifications in form, and break up into\r\ninnumerable smaller fragments or particles that differ both in size\r\nand in shape. The arrangement of these small bodies is such that\r\nintercommunicating spaces or pores are left between them, and through\r\nthese channels flows a sap or juice containing larger and smaller\r\nparticles; the larger ones composed of blood, and the smaller of vapor\r\nor heat. Health, according to Asclepiades, is that state in which the\r\nprimitive atoms are properly distributed or placed and the flow of the\r\njuices in the pores takes place normally. When, however, the flow is\r\narrested and the primitive atoms are disordered in their relations to\r\neach other and to the pores, or when the elements composing the fluid\r\ncontents of the latter become mixed, disease results. Alterations in\r\nthe pores themselves, as contradistinguished from the fluid contained\r\nwithin them, may also cause disease. Farther on, when the proper time\r\narrives for considering the sect of the Methodists, I shall have\r\noccasion to discuss this subject again, and particularly that part\r\nof it which relates to pathology. In the meantime, however, I cannot\r\nresist the impulse to say a few words about the remarkable insight\r\npossessed by Asclepiades into the manner of construction of the human\r\nbody, as manifested by this very brief but very significant anatomical\r\nand physiological description. Upon a first reading one might easily\r\nget the impression that Asclepiades has reference to only one kind or\r\nsystem of “pores” or channels--viz., such as serve for the circulation\r\nof tissue juices alone. But, upon a closer scrutiny of the text, one\r\nfinds some warrant for suspecting that he had in mind more than one\r\nsystem of such channels; for he states distinctly that the fluid\r\ncirculating in these pores contains larger particles composed of blood\r\nand smaller ones which consist of vapor (_spiritus_) or heat. The\r\nquestion suggests itself: Could a man who had no knowledge of Harvey’s\r\ndiscovery, who did not possess a microscope, and who at the same time\r\nbelieved--as did all the ancients--that air circulated in the arteries\r\nand blood in the veins, come any nearer to the actual truth than did\r\nAsclepiades? His description needs very few alterations and additions\r\nto make it fit correctly the system of terminal arterio-venous channels\r\nknown to-day as arterioles and capillaries.\r\n\r\n_Methods of Treatment Adopted by Asclepiades._--The prevailing\r\nmethods of treating diseases in Rome were not approved by Asclepiades,\r\nand he lost no opportunity of giving expression to this disapproval.\r\nIn the first place, he protested vigorously against the practice\r\nof prescribing on every possible occasion purgatives and remedies\r\ncapable of producing vomiting. He had a decided preference for gentler\r\nmeasures, his idea being that a physician should cure his patients\r\n_tuto, celeriter, et jucunde_--safely, quickly and agreeably. Le\r\nClerc adds that this is a fine sentiment, but that its realization\r\nin actual practice is something which most physicians find it very\r\ndifficult to attain. Asclepiades condemned strongly the employment of\r\nmagical remedies, a practice which was still much in use at that time\r\nin Rome, although it was already less common than it had previously\r\nbeen. Cato’s collection of household remedies contains a short list\r\nof some of these appeals to man’s superstition.[29] In addition to\r\nthe remedial measures mentioned above, Asclepiades placed his chief\r\ndependence on the following: abstinence from meat; the employment of\r\nwine under certain well-defined circumstances; massage and frictions;\r\nbaths of different kinds (it is said that he devised a great variety);\r\nwalking; driving and being carried about in the open air in a litter\r\nor in a boat on a quiet river or in the protected harbor. One of his\r\nremedies in the case of sleeplessness consisted in having the patient\r\nplaced in a suspended couch which could easily be rocked from side to\r\nside. As all these measures were agreeable and could at the same time\r\neasily be employed by almost everybody, they met with general favor,\r\nand in consequence Asclepiades was looked upon by the Romans as “a\r\nperson sent from heaven.” As a rule, he recommended the drinking of\r\nsimple water, but in certain cases (to be mentioned farther on) he did\r\nnot hesitate to advise the taking of wine in moderation. He advocated\r\ntracheotomy, in cases of inflammation of the throat, in preference to\r\nthe then prevailing practice--both very painful and quite difficult to\r\ncarry out--of introducing a tube of some kind as a means of opening a\r\npassage for the entrance of air into the lungs.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc quotes Galen as authority for the statement that Asclepiades,\r\nwho never hesitated for an instant to criticise the different\r\ntherapeutic procedures of his predecessors, did not go so far as to\r\ncondemn wholly the practice of bloodletting. Indeed, he was quite ready\r\nto employ it in the treatment of painful affections because, as he\r\nclaimed, the pain was caused “by the retention of the larger particles\r\nor atoms in the pores or channels of the tissues, and hence--as\r\nthese particles were composed of blood--bloodletting was the only\r\nremedy capable of setting them free.” Thus, he resorted to bleeding\r\nin pleurisy, because this affection is characterized by pain; but he\r\nabstained from employing the remedy in “peripneumonia” or “inflammation\r\nof the lung,” because in most cases it is not accompanied by pain;\r\nand he also did not approve of its employment in inflammation of the\r\nbrain (_phrenitis_). On the other hand, he advocated bleeding\r\nin epilepsy and all forms of disease in which convulsions occurred,\r\nand he also advocated it in cases of hemorrhage of every description.\r\nQuinsy sore throat was another malady in which he drew blood freely\r\nfrom the veins of the arm, of the temple and even of the tongue; and\r\nin addition, when the disease was severe, he scarified the skin at\r\nsuitable spots and applied cups to the part. In all these measures\r\nhis purpose was “to open the pores”; and when this treatment failed\r\nhe incised the tonsils or the uvula, and even, as a last resort,\r\nperformed laryngotomy or tracheotomy. In cases of dropsy he employed\r\n_paracentesis abdominis_,--that is, he made a very small opening\r\nin the abdominal wall to serve as an outlet for the fluid contained in\r\nthe peritoneal cavity. From these facts it is evident that Asclepiades\r\ndid not always abide by his rule not to use any but very gentle\r\nremedies.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades showed, in his manner of treating still other pathological\r\nconditions, how different was his practice from that of his\r\npredecessors. In the first place, he was very partial, as has already\r\nbeen stated, to such extremely mild forms of physical exercise in\r\nthe open air as one can obtain from driving or from being carried\r\nin a litter or a boat. He prescribed these measures, not merely for\r\nconvalescents but also for those, for example, who were still in the\r\nmidst of an active fever. His idea was, that by means of such very\r\ngentle forms of exercise the pores would become less clogged and\r\nwould permit the juices of the body to flow more freely. In cases of\r\ndropsy, also, he was in the habit of employing friction for precisely\r\nthe same purpose. He even used this remedy in cases of inflammation\r\nof the brain, in the expectation that he might thereby induce sleep\r\nfor these patients. Indeed, this subject of frictions was one on which\r\nAsclepiades wrote at greater length than on any other remedial agent.\r\n\r\nIt is a surprising fact that, in common with Erasistratus, he taught\r\nthe doctrine that physical exercise was not at all necessary to persons\r\nin normal health. At the same time he approved of it, when carefully\r\ngraded, for those who were affected with bodily ills of a certain\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWine was another remedy which Asclepiades was fond of prescribing\r\nin all sorts of maladies, but his rules in regard to the manner in\r\nwhich it should be employed were quite different from those adopted\r\nby his contemporaries. A few illustrations will suffice to show the\r\ndifferent conditions for which he was wont to advocate the taking of\r\nwine: He gave it, for example,--though probably much diluted with\r\nwater--to patients affected with fever, but only after the stage of\r\ngreatest activity had been passed. Strange as it may appear to-day,\r\nhe was rather in favor of giving to patients ill with inflammation of\r\nthe brain (_phrenitis_) wine in sufficient quantity to produce\r\nintoxication; his belief being that he could in this way induce\r\ndrowsiness and eventually sleep--a thing so desirable for those\r\naffected with that disease. Further, he instructed sufferers from\r\ncatarrh to drink twice or three times as much wine as they usually\r\ndrank, in consequence of which instructions the patients found it\r\nnecessary to dilute their wine with water to a less degree than\r\nusual--that is, to such a degree that the proportion would be one-half\r\nof each; thus showing, as Le Clerc remarks, how sober the ancients\r\nmust have been when they were in perfect health. They probably--he\r\nadds--drank their wine ordinarily in the proportion of five-sixths\r\nwater to one-sixth wine, or, at most, three-quarters water to\r\none-quarter wine.\r\n\r\nIn some cases Asclepiades prescribed the drinking of wine (particularly\r\nthe wine of Cos) to which sea-water had been added; his idea being\r\nthat the addition of salt would enable the wine to penetrate farther\r\ninto the tissues and thus open the pores more freely. This idea of\r\nadded salt was not original with him, for Pliny states that in certain\r\nparts of Greece it was customary to place casks filled with new wine\r\nin the sea and to leave them there for some time. The wine, it was\r\nclaimed, was rendered by this procedure mature and pleasanter to drink.\r\nThey called wine thus treated “Thalassite wine” (from the Greek word\r\n“thalassa,” sea). In cases of jaundice he occasionally recommended the\r\ndrinking of plain sea-water, whereby the bowels were stimulated to act\r\nmore freely. Under ordinary circumstances he employed, for the relief\r\nof constipation, clysters, but he was sparing in their use.\r\n\r\nThe remedial measures enumerated above, together with dieting, are\r\nthose upon which Asclepiades chiefly relied in his practice. In acute\r\ndiseases he made very little use of drugs that were to be taken\r\ninternally, but in maladies of a chronic character he employed them\r\nquite freely. Gargles, poultices and inunctions are mentioned among the\r\nexternal remedies which he often prescribed.\r\n\r\n_Further Particulars Regarding the Life and Career of\r\nAsclepiades._--Le Clerc furnishes a number of details which throw\r\nadditional light upon the career of Asclepiades. During the latter’s\r\nlifetime his professional reputation was very great. Lucius Apuleius,\r\nthe famous Roman satirist and rhetorician, and a contemporary of\r\nAsclepiades, calls him the Prince of Physicians, second only to\r\nHippocrates the Great; Scribonius Largus, a Roman physician and writer,\r\nwho flourished during the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius and\r\nClaudius (37–54 A. D.), speaks of him as a great medical author; Sextus\r\nEmpiricus, a writer remarkable for his learning and acumen, who lived\r\nin the first half of the third century A. D., calls him a physician of\r\nunrivaled skill; and Celsus, who is termed the Cicero of physicians,\r\non account of the purity of his Latin, holds him in high esteem as a\r\nmedical authority. His fame as a physician had spread to Asia Minor,\r\nfor we are told that Mithridates, King of Pontus, who reigned from 120\r\nB. C. to 63 B. C., and who was a man of great ability and great energy,\r\ninvited him to take up his residence at his court; but Asclepiades\r\nrefused. Perhaps a still stronger evidence of his real worth as a man\r\nis to be found in the fact that he was the physician and personal\r\nfriend of Cicero.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these strongly favorable estimates of the ability\r\nof Asclepiades there were not a few men, and they too men of great\r\nauthority, who were indisposed to give him so conspicuous a place in\r\nthe temple of fame. Galen, for example, while admitting that he was a\r\nvery eloquent physician, maintained that he was a sophist, given to\r\nquibbling, and disposed to contradict everybody. Caelius Aurelianus, a\r\ncontemporary of Galen and the author of the most important practical\r\ntreatise on Methodism that has come down to our time, appears to have\r\nheld the same opinion as Galen with regard to Asclepiades. The complete\r\ndisappearance of all the writings of the latter author makes it\r\nimpossible for us at the present time to form an independent judgment\r\nas to the merits of these conflicting estimates of the man’s character.\r\nGalen was a great admirer of Hippocrates and it is very likely that he\r\ntook offense at the failure of Asclepiades to accept all the teachings\r\nand therapeutic methods of his hero. As to the reasons which led\r\nCaelius Aurelianus to agree with the estimate made by Galen, we know\r\nabsolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nToward the middle of the seventeenth century there was discovered at\r\nRome, not far from the Capena gate, a portrait bust in white marble\r\nof Asclepiades. It was probably executed by a Greek sculptor residing\r\nin Rome, for, if the work had been done in Greece, the face would\r\nhave been represented with a beard, as are the heads of Hippocrates,\r\nSoranus and other celebrated physicians of antiquity. The absence of\r\nthe beard, furthermore, shows--according to the opinion of antiquarian\r\nexperts--that the bust must have been sculptured before the time of the\r\nEmperor Claudius (41–54 A. D.), as he was the first of the Caesars to\r\nwear a beard. This bust, which is a little larger than life-size, is\r\nat present--if I am rightly informed--in the Capitoline Museum at Rome.\r\n\r\nAsclepiades lived to a great age. In descending, one day, a flight of\r\nsteps he fell and received injuries from which he died.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n     THE STATE OF MEDICINE AT ROME AFTER THE DEATH OF ASCLEPIADES;\r\n             THE FOUNDING OF THE SCHOOL OF THE METHODISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn summing up the effects which were produced by the teaching and\r\npractice of Asclepiades upon the science and art of medicine, Dr.\r\nMeyer-Steineg makes the remark that the wide and ready acceptance of\r\nboth depended largely upon the personal character of the man, upon the\r\nmanner in which he carried out the measures which he advocated, and\r\nupon the fact that the Romans happened at that period of their history\r\nto be ready to respond favorably to such new doctrines and therapeutic\r\nmethods; but that, as soon as his strong personality had ceased to\r\nexert its influence, as it did after he had passed the active period\r\nof his life, and also because Rome did not at that moment possess any\r\nphysicians who were sufficiently endowed with his medical gifts and\r\nsagacity to perpetuate his art, both it and his doctrines began to lose\r\nground. Nevertheless, as this writer states, Asclepiades had already\r\nsucceeded admirably in preparing the way for a further development of\r\nthe healing art, and for this valuable service full credit should be\r\ngiven him.\r\n\r\nNot long after the death of Asclepiades, Antonius Musa,[30] the\r\npersonal physician of the Emperor Augustus, succeeded, by means of\r\nhydrotherapy, in curing his royal patient of a protracted gouty or\r\nrheumatic affection from which he had been a sufferer; and, as a mark\r\nof gratitude for the cure which he had effected, the Emperor raised\r\nhim to the rank of a noble (about the year 10 A. D.), erected a statue\r\nin his honor in the temple of Aesculapius, and at the same time issued\r\na decree that from that time forward the physicians who practiced in\r\nRome should be exempted from taxation and from certain other civic\r\nburdens. These privileges, which were afterward confirmed by Vespasian\r\n(70–79 A. D.) and also by Antoninus Pius (138–161 A. D.),[31] were of\r\ngreat advantage to the medical profession as a whole. Julius Caesar\r\n(100–44 B. C.), it will be remembered, had already (about half a\r\ncentury earlier) bestowed Roman Citizenship upon the physicians who\r\npracticed their profession in that city. Thus, at the time of which\r\nwe are now speaking, the medical men of Rome occupied the enviable\r\nposition of being on an equality with their fellow citizens of the\r\nbetter class, a position which made it attractive for young men of\r\nability and of good social standing to enter the profession.\r\n\r\nAmong the numerous followers of Asclepiades the most distinguished\r\nwas undoubtedly Themison of Laodicea, a city of Phrygia, Asia Minor,\r\nwho flourished about the middle of the first century B. C. When he\r\nwas well advanced in years he wrote a medical treatise in which he\r\ndeveloped a system of pathology and therapeutics that was accepted as\r\nthe professional creed of the sect known as “Methodists.” Starting\r\nfrom the doctrine of pores and primitive atoms taught by Asclepiades,\r\nhe laid great stress upon the idea that in disease all the alterations\r\nwhich take place in the tissues may be classed in one or the other of\r\nthese two categories--a relaxation (_laxum_) or a contraction\r\n(_strictum_) of the parts. To these two categories, which the\r\nMethodists termed “communities,” and which were the only ones at first\r\naccepted as a part of their creed, a third was soon added, viz., that\r\ncondition in which both relaxed and contracted states appear side by\r\nside, although not necessarily both of them developed to the same\r\ndegree; and to this third category or “community” they applied the\r\nterm “_mixtum_.” The ideas which are here stated in a somewhat\r\ncrude and imperfect manner owing to my lack of knowledge of all the\r\nfacts, constitute the basis of the pathology of the “Methodists”--a\r\npathology which held its own in the domain of medicine during a period\r\nof four hundred years, and which--in contradistinction to the humoral\r\npathology of Hippocrates--is justly entitled to the name of “solidist\r\npathology.” This doctrine, as might be expected, underwent certain\r\nmodifications during this long period of time, but they were not\r\nserious enough to alter materially the fundamental form of the teaching\r\nas it has here been described.\r\n\r\nThemison and his followers, like their distinguished predecessor,\r\nAsclepiades, possessed something more than a mere glimmering of the\r\ntruth in pathology as we know it to-day; and this idea suggests\r\nthe further thought that Morgagni, Rokitansky, Lebert, Virchow and\r\nperhaps others whose names do not now occur to me, could scarcely have\r\ndeveloped a better pathology if they had lived during these first\r\ncenturies of the Christian era--a period of time when public sentiment\r\ndid not permit postmortem examinations, when Harvey’s discovery was not\r\neven dreamed of, when the microscope was unknown, and when experimental\r\npathology was an impossibility. Many centuries had still to elapse\r\nbefore medicine could gain that freedom of action, that rich equipment\r\nof tools, and that stock of accumulated knowledge which enable her in\r\nthese days to make such giant strides forward as we have witnessed\r\nduring the past twenty or thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe question will naturally arise, How did the Methodists decide, in\r\nthe presence of an actual case of illness, which one of these abnormal\r\nstates (the laxum, the strictum, or the mixtum) was the condition\r\nthat called for medical treatment? The answer which they gave to this\r\nquestion was, that the condition of the different secretions and the\r\ndejections furnished the principal indication as to what particular\r\npart or organ of the body was ailing, and also as to what was the\r\nnature of the morbid change or process that produced the malady. When,\r\nfor example, the secretion from an organ or part was excessive, they\r\ninferred that the pores of such a part were relaxed and distended,\r\nthus permitting an increased flow; and when the secretion was less\r\nthan it should be, they decided that the pores were contracted. The\r\n_status mixtus_ had reference to those cases in which a condition\r\nof relaxation was observed in one part of the body, while that of\r\ncontraction was noted in another.\r\n\r\nNeuburger mentions the fact that the Methodists were somewhat arbitrary\r\nin their classification of the different diseases, most of the acute\r\nmaladies being placed by them under the heading _Status strictus_,\r\nwhile they assigned the majority of the chronic affections to the\r\ncategory of _Status laxus_.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the tendency of the Methodists to classify and simplify\r\nall the departments of medicine was not wholly beneficial. It conveyed\r\nto many the impression that medicine might readily be learned in the\r\ncourse of a few months, and thus offered the temptation to inferior\r\nmen to choose the career of physician; and yet, on the other hand,\r\nit infused into the art the essentially Roman characteristics of\r\norderliness, simplicity and efficiency. Anatomy, for example, was\r\nstudied only so far as a knowledge of this department of medicine was\r\nnecessary to render the physician familiar with the location, general\r\ncharacter and relations of the different organs. There was one field,\r\nhowever, in which the adherents of this school displayed a high degree\r\nof excellence, viz., in their descriptions of disease; and this is\r\nespecially true of those written by Caelius Aurelianus (fourth century\r\nA. D.), whose manner of handling the subject of differential diagnosis\r\nis far more thorough and satisfactory than that of any of the medical\r\nauthors who preceded him.\r\n\r\nIn their treatment of disease, the Methodists were largely guided by\r\nthe principle of _contraria contrariis_,--_i.e._, in those\r\ncases in which, to the best of their belief, a _status laxus_\r\nexisted, they administered astringents, in the hope of thereby bringing\r\nthe parts back more nearly to a contracted condition; and, _vice\r\nversa_, when the diagnosis of _status strictus_ was made, they\r\ngave a relaxing medicine. The terms “laxatives” and “astringents,”\r\nwhich are still applied to many drugs, were originated by the\r\nMethodists. Bloodletting, for example, was one of the remedies which\r\nthey used for producing relaxation, and an astringent was employed\r\nwhen a contrary effect was desired. In the list of relaxing remedial\r\nagents (aside from bloodletting) were placed the following: warm\r\nbaths, poultices, inunctions with warm oil, vapor baths, fasting and a\r\nrestricted diet, diuretics (very carefully watched and employed only in\r\nexceptional cases), emetics, diaphoretics and laxatives. The following\r\nagents, on the other hand, were classed as contracting, astringent and\r\ntonic remedies: washing with cold water, cold baths, the application of\r\ncloths dipped in cold water, living in cold air, strengthening diet,\r\nwine, vinegar, alum, narcotics, etc. Themison, it should be added, is\r\nthe first one among the ancient writers to mention the use of leeches\r\nas a means of extracting blood. It does not follow from this, however,\r\nthat he was the discoverer of this method of local bloodletting; for it\r\nis highly probable that this procedure had been in common use for many\r\nyears previous to his time.\r\n\r\nThemison, as I have before stated, was an old man when he laid the\r\nfoundations for Methodism, and it is not probable that it attained\r\nmuch importance as a sect until several years after his death. Then\r\nThessalus, a native of Tralles, a flourishing commercial city of Asia\r\nMinor, and a man who had received his medical training in one of the\r\nGreek schools, materially added to the body of doctrines held by this\r\nsect, and at the same time rendered them more acceptable to physicians\r\ngenerally. He was of humble birth, the son of a wool carder, and his\r\neducation had been rather neglected; but he nevertheless managed, by\r\nhis own efforts and in no small degree by the unlimited self-confidence\r\n(Galen calls it impudence) which he possessed, to push his way to\r\nthe top of the ladder.[32] He acquired a large fortune during the\r\nreign of Nero (54–68 A. D.) and apparently succeeded in persuading\r\nthis monarch that he was a great physician. Here are some facts which\r\nappear to justify Galen’s dislike for Thessalus: In a letter to Nero\r\nthe latter writes: “I have founded a new medical sect, the only\r\ngenuine one in existence. I was forced to do so because the physicians\r\nwho preceded me had failed to discover anything that is likely to\r\npromote health or to drive away disease; even Hippocrates himself\r\nhaving laid down doctrines which are positively harmful.” His vanity,\r\naccording to Le Clerc, reached such a pitch that he called himself the\r\n“conqueror of physicians.”[33] Pliny corroborates the latter statement\r\nin the following words: “When he assumed the title of ‘conqueror of\r\nphysicians,’ a title which was engraved, according to his instructions,\r\non his tomb in the Appian Way.” Notwithstanding his unbounded conceit,\r\nThessalus appears to have made several important improvements in the\r\ndoctrines of the Methodists. He is also, as it appears, entitled to the\r\ncredit of having been the first to inaugurate the practice of giving\r\nsystematic instruction at the bedside; thus establishing for all time a\r\nmost valuable precedent for the guidance of his successors.\r\n\r\n   “He was an excellent practitioner and an original thinker....\r\n   He was also a prolific writer, as is shown by the number and\r\n   variety of treatises which--as we are assured by Caelius\r\n   Aurelianus--were composed by him.” The same authority speaks of\r\n   him as “a leader among our chiefs,” thus affording good evidence\r\n   of the degree of esteem in which he was held by the members\r\n   of his own school. The fact that pupils came in throngs to be\r\n   taught by him shows clearly how thoroughly he understood the\r\n   needs of the physicians of Rome. (Meyer-Steineg.)\r\n\r\nThessalus, notwithstanding his declaration that medicine might readily\r\nbe taught in six months, wrote a larger number of treatises on\r\nprofessional topics than any student of medicine could possibly read\r\nand digest in the course of two or three years. They filled several\r\nlarge volumes, but not one of them is known to exist to-day. He wrote\r\nat great length, as we are assured, on the subject of surgery, a\r\nsubject in which he took an active interest. He taught that ulcers, no\r\nmatter in what part of the body they may be located, require the same\r\nkind of treatment.\r\n\r\n   If an ulcer is excavated, it is necessary to bring about a\r\n   filling-up of the excavation; if its surface is on a level with\r\n   the surrounding skin, the aim should be to make it cicatrize;\r\n   if the growth of new tissue is excessive, the redundant portion\r\n   should be destroyed by burning with caustic; and, finally, if\r\n   the ulcer is of recent development and bleeds readily, the\r\n   attempt should be made, by approximating the edges, to effect an\r\n   immediate healing.\r\n\r\nIn the treatment of chronic ulcers which show little or no disposition\r\nto heal, and which, when they do finally heal, are very prone to break\r\nopen afresh, Thessalus urges the great importance of ascertaining, if\r\npossible, the cause or causes of this behavior. If it be found that\r\nthe trouble is due to some weakness or abnormal predisposition of\r\nthe part in which the ulcer is located, or that the condition of the\r\nentire body is probably the real cause of the trouble, he recommends\r\nthe employment of “metasyncritic remedies”--that is, remedial measures\r\nwhich effect a marked change in the individual’s vital processes\r\nthroughout the body, and also such as exert an alterative effect upon\r\nthe ulcer itself. Among the measures of the first class he enumerates\r\nthe following: Various forms of physical exercise; alternately\r\nincreasing and diminishing the amount of nourishment taken; and perhaps\r\nthe taking of an emetic at the very commencement of the treatment.\r\nAs to the second class of measures--those needed to bring about a\r\nchange in the ulcer itself--he makes the following recommendations:\r\nRemove from the diseased tissues as much as will restore the parts,\r\nas nearly as possible, to the condition of a healthy wound, and then\r\nadopt the treatment suited for the latter condition. In cases in which\r\nthe ulcer heals and then subsequently breaks open again, it will\r\nsometimes be found beneficial to apply in the neighborhood a plaster\r\ncontaining an irritating substance like mustard, the effect of which\r\nis often to change the disposition of the parts. In actual practice he\r\nrecommends that the local measures should be employed first, and then,\r\nif they fail to accomplish the desired purpose, the physician should\r\nhave recourse to those enumerated in the first class--the strictly\r\nmetasyncritic remedies.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to believe that a man so full of conceit and so\r\nunjust in his criticisms of his predecessors as Thessalus clearly was,\r\ncould be capable of formulating such a concise statement of the nature\r\nof chronic ulcers and such a practical rule for their proper treatment.\r\nHis development of the idea of “metasyncrisis”--or renovation of the\r\nbody (_recorporatio_), as Caelius Aurelianus translates the\r\nword--seems to have been original with Thessalus.[34] The Methodists,\r\nit should be added, deserve special credit for having been the first\r\nto introduce and carry into effect the systematic treatment of chronic\r\ndiseases; and, as a general proposition, it may be said that their\r\ntreatment of all forms of disease was thoroughly practical, free from\r\nall tendency to resort to magical methods, and based largely on the\r\nemployment of such hygienic measures as the use of baths of different\r\nkinds (hydrotherapy), massage, moderate outdoor exercise, passive\r\nmovements, sea voyages, fasting, regulation of the diet, etc. One\r\nof the favorite practices--of which Thessalus was said to have been\r\nthe originator--was to begin the treatment of almost all maladies by\r\nprescribing an abstinence from all food for a period of three full\r\ndays. When I come to speak of Soranus and Caelius Aurelianus I shall\r\nprobably have occasion to give further details regarding the methods of\r\ntreatment employed by the Methodists.\r\n\r\nAs a system, says Neuburger, Methodism was not capable of inaugurating\r\nany fundamental advances in medicine; the most that it was able\r\nto accomplish was to broaden and otherwise improve the domain of\r\ntherapeutics, and some of its wiser members were diligent in collecting\r\nand sifting critically a large number of valuable experiences, which\r\nwere then courteously registered by them to the credit of the sect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n     THE FURTHER HISTORY OF METHODISM AT ROME, AND THE DEVELOPMENT\r\n     OF TWO NEW SECTS, VIZ., THE PNEUMATISTS AND THE ECLECTICS.--A\r\n          GENERAL SURVEY OF THE SUBJECT OF SECTS IN MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the Methodists there were many physicians who attained more\r\nor less distinction during their professional career, but only two\r\nof them, beside those whose contributions to medical knowledge have\r\nalready been mentioned in these pages, gained sufficient celebrity to\r\njustify me in devoting some additional space to the description of the\r\nwork which they accomplished. Soranus, of Ephesus on the coast of Asia\r\nMinor, and Caelius Aurelianus, of Sicca in the north of Africa, are the\r\nphysicians to whom I have reference.\r\n\r\nIt was Soranus, says Le Clerc, who gave the finishing touches to\r\nthe system of the Methodists, and the work which he did was of such\r\nexcellence that he may with justice be called the ablest and most\r\nskilful of all the members of that school. Caelius calls him “a chief\r\namong the leaders of our sect.” He received his medical training at\r\nAlexandria and came to Rome about the year 100 A. D. His professional\r\ncareer covered the period corresponding to the reigns of Trajan and\r\nHadrian (98–138 A. D.). He is known to posterity chiefly through\r\nhis two treatises--one on obstetrics and gynaecology and the other\r\non acute and chronic diseases. The first of these treatises, in the\r\noriginal Greek, was rediscovered in 1838 by Reinhold Dietz, Professor\r\nof Medicine in the University of Königsberg, Prussia, and a German\r\ntranslation of the work (by Lüneberg and Huber) was published in Munich\r\nin 1894. Moschion, who was probably a pupil of Soranus, wrote a popular\r\ntreatise on the same subject for the use of midwives, and in this book\r\nhe has reproduced much of the material which is to be found in the work\r\nof his master. The treatise written by Caelius Aurelianus on acute and\r\nchronic diseases is admitted by him to be founded on that which Soranus\r\nwrote on the same subject. In fact, as Daremberg states, the work of\r\nthe former represents almost a translation (into Latin) of Soranus’\r\ntreatise. The sources just named are the principal ones from which our\r\nknowledge of this author is derived.\r\n\r\nSoranus was a prolific writer; the treatises which he wrote and which\r\ndeal with a great variety of subjects, number thirty in all. The\r\nmajority of these works, however, have been lost. He had many followers\r\nand his influence upon medical science was very great, not simply\r\nduring his lifetime, but also for several centuries after his death.\r\nHe commanded the respect and confidence of the opponents of Methodism\r\nas well as of the members of his own sect. One of his most pronounced\r\ntraits of character was his readiness to condemn, on every possible\r\noccasion, superstitious practices, such as the employment of amulets,\r\nmagnets, etc. He was also a very persistent and earnest advocate of\r\nthe gentler and more rational obstetric methods. For example, he\r\ndisapproved of the reckless employment of remedies for hastening the\r\nexpulsion of the foetus, of the practice of succussion (which was\r\ncarried out by the aid of a ladder), of making the pregnant woman run\r\nup and down stairs, of a resort to rough mechanical procedures for\r\nextracting the placenta, etc. The following quotation from one of\r\nSoranus’ treatises (Gynaeciorum, Lib. I., cap. 19) reveals clearly what\r\nsort of a man and physician he was:--\r\n\r\n   There is a disagreement; for some reject destructive practices,\r\n   calling to witness Hippocrates, who says, “I will give nothing\r\n   whatever destructive” and deeming it the special province of\r\n   medicine to guard and preserve what nature generates. Another\r\n   party maintains the same view, but makes this distinction,\r\n   viz.: that the fruit of conception is not to be destroyed at\r\n   will because of adultery or of care for beauty, but is to be\r\n   destroyed to avert danger impending at parturition, if the\r\n   uterus be small and cannot subserve the perfecting of the fruit,\r\n   or have hard swellings and cracks at its mouth, or if some\r\n   similar condition prevail. This party says the same thing about\r\n   preventing conception, and with it I agree.\r\n\r\n   (Translated from the Greek by the late John G. Curtis, M.D., of\r\n   New York.)\r\n\r\nSoranus was not only a great obstetrician,--admitted by all the\r\nauthorities to have been the greatest in ancient times,--he was also\r\nin high repute for the work which he did in other departments of\r\nmedicine--in gynaecology, for example, in the instruction of midwives,\r\nin the management of children’s diseases, in the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of both acute and chronic diseases, in surgery, etc. While in\r\ngeneral he adhered to the fundamental teachings of the Methodists, he\r\ndid not hesitate to depart from the beaten pathway of that sect in his\r\nexplanations of certain pathological conditions; for he was more of a\r\nclinical observer than a sectarian, and it was probably his independent\r\nmanner of thinking that gave the sect new vigor and thus enabled it to\r\nlive on through such a long period of time. Galen, who was not at all\r\ndisposed to speak favorably of the Methodists, says that he tried a\r\nnumber of the remedies recommended by Soranus and found them good.\r\n\r\nCaelius Aurelianus probably flourished during the third century A. D.\r\nThe different authorities, however, do not agree as to the limits of\r\nthe period during which he lived; some saying that his career antedated\r\nthat of Galen, while others claim that he came upon the scene after\r\nthe death of the latter, which occurred early in the third century A.\r\nD. His chief merit appears to have been that, through his translation\r\nof the writings of Soranus into Latin, he placed within reach of the\r\nphysicians of Rome the teachings of that admirable diagnostician and\r\ntherapeutist; for it must be remembered that the great majority of the\r\nRoman medical men were not able to read Greek. On the other hand,\r\nCaelius Aurelianus, who was himself a thoroughly practical physician,\r\ndeserves considerable credit for having enriched the text of his book\r\nwith many very appropriate examples (chiefly with regard to questions\r\nof diagnosis) drawn from his own personal experience, which must\r\nhave been extensive. During the Middle Ages, as we are informed by\r\nFriedlaender, this work furnished the chief source from which the monks\r\nderived their knowledge about diseases and their proper treatment.\r\nThe Latin in which the book is written is described by nearly all the\r\nauthorities as barbaric.\r\n\r\n_The Pneumatists._--Methodism had been established only a very\r\nfew years when Athenaeus of Attalia, a city on the coast of Pamphylia,\r\nAsia Minor, founded (about 50 A. D.) a new sect--that of “Pneumatism.”\r\nHe was not the discoverer of the “pneuma” or “vital spirit,” for that\r\nhad already been admitted by the earlier schools of philosophy as a\r\nfifth primary creative element, supplementary to the four well-known\r\nsubstances--fire, air, earth and water. He believed that heat, cold,\r\nmoisture and dryness (the primary qualities of these four bodies)\r\nwere not the veritable elements of living beings. Heat and cold, he\r\nmaintained, were “efficient causes” and moisture and dryness “material\r\ncauses.” To these he added “spirit” as a fifth element; and he taught\r\nthat this spirit enters into the formation of all bodies and preserves\r\nthem in what may be termed their natural state. It was from the\r\nStoics, more particularly, that Athenaeus borrowed this belief, and\r\nit was the latter fact, as Le Clerc says, which led Galen to speak of\r\nChrysippus--one of the most famous of the Stoics--as “the Father of the\r\nSect of the Pneumatists.”\r\n\r\nIn his application of the doctrine of Pneumatism to the science of\r\nmedicine, Athenaeus maintained that the majority of diseases owed their\r\norigin to some disturbance or disorder of the spirit; but it is almost\r\nimpossible to understand, from the scanty data which have come down\r\nto us, what Athenaeus really meant by the term “spirit,” and by the\r\nexpression “disorder of the spirit.”\r\n\r\n   From the definition which he gives of the word “pulse” one\r\n   is justified in drawing the conclusion that he considered\r\n   the spirit to be an actual substance, capable of undergoing,\r\n   to a greater or less degree, such changes as expansion and\r\n   contraction. The same obscurity of meaning is encountered when\r\n   one endeavors to discover how the new doctrine affected the\r\n   practice of medicine. (Le Clerc.)\r\n\r\nIn view of all these circumstances it is not at all surprising that\r\nPneumatism was not very popular with the physicians of Rome, and\r\nthat, after a brief period had elapsed, many of the adherents of\r\nthis doctrine abandoned it and gave their preference to the more\r\npractical teachings of the Methodists. Meyer-Steineg goes so far as to\r\nremark that, to all intents and purposes, such a thing as a sect of\r\nPneumatists did not exist.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent of the disciples of Athenaeus were Theodorus,\r\nAgathinus, Herodotus, Magnus and Archigenes.\r\n\r\nHaller speaks of Theodorus as the inventor of a remedy which, as he\r\nclaimed, cures all cases of poisoning.\r\n\r\n_The Eclectics._--Agathinus, a native of Sparta, was the teacher\r\nof Herodotus and Archigenes. His chief distinction is to be found\r\nin the fact that he gave to the offshoot from the school of the\r\nPneumatists the name of “Eclectics,”[35] his object being, as we are\r\nassured by Neuburger, to bring the three sects (Pneumatists, Empirics\r\nand Methodists) into closer union.\r\n\r\nHerodotus--who, it is perhaps desirable to state, is a different person\r\nfrom the famous historical writer of the same name--lived during the\r\nlatter part of the first century A. D., and was more closely allied to\r\nthe Methodists than to the Pneumatists. It appears from the text of a\r\nfragment of one of his treatises that he wrote a description of the\r\ndisease now called small-pox and directed attention to its contagious\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nMagnus, a native of Ephesus in Asia Minor, is reported to have been\r\nthe writer of a collection of letters on medical topics and also of a\r\nhistory of the discoveries made in medicine subsequently to the time of\r\nThemison.\r\n\r\nArchigenes, the fifth member of this group of Pneumatists, was born\r\nin Apamea, Syria, and lived in Rome under the reigns of Trajan\r\n(98–117 A. D.) and Hadrian (117–138 A. D.). Le Clerc speaks of him as\r\nbelonging to the Eclectics rather than to the Pneumatists. This is\r\na matter, however, of small importance, as the sects were, at that\r\nperiod, very much mixed. The poet Juvenal, who was a contemporary\r\nof Archigenes, refers to him briefly as a physician who had a large\r\npractice; and the historian Suidas says that he wrote a great deal\r\nabout physics as well as about medicine. That he was esteemed highly\r\nas an authority in practical surgery is shown by the fact that Galen,\r\nwhen he discusses surgical topics, makes frequent quotations from\r\nthe writings of Archigenes. Only fragments of the latter, however,\r\nhave come down to our time. His popularity as a practitioner was very\r\ngreat; notwithstanding which he managed to write several treatises\r\non a variety of topics--on the pulse, on feverish diseases, on the\r\ndifferent types of fevers, on local affections, on the diagnosis and\r\ntreatment of acute and chronic maladies, on the right moment when\r\nsurgical operations should be performed, on drugs, and on therapeutic\r\nprocedures in general. He applied ligatures to blood-vessels and also\r\narrested further bleeding from them by passing needles through the\r\nadjacent parts in such a manner as to exert pressure upon the vessel (a\r\nprocedure which is termed “acupressure”); he operated for the removal\r\nof both mammary and uterine cancers; he employed the red-hot cautery\r\niron for the arrest of hemorrhage and also for the relief of coxalgia,\r\nand he was familiar with the use of the vaginal speculum.\r\n\r\nAntyllus, another prominent surgeon of that period, joined the\r\nMethodists at a considerably later date. He was also the author\r\nof an excellent treatise on surgery, the greater part of which,\r\nunfortunately, has been lost or destroyed.\r\n\r\nAretaeus of Cappadocia, a district of Asia Minor, lived during the\r\nsecond century A. D. He was a man of very broad culture. From the\r\nfact that he assigned an important rôle to the pneuma, he is usually\r\nclassed among the Pneumatists. He does not appear, however, to have\r\ntaken a very active interest in the doctrines of that school, and both\r\nLe Clerc and Daremberg seem disposed to call him an Eclectic, and we\r\nmay therefore rank him as one of the independent physicians of that\r\nperiod. It is doubtful whether he ever practiced in Rome. His two\r\ntreatises--one on the causes and means of identifying acute and chronic\r\ndiseases, and the other on the treatment of these diseases--are written\r\nin Greek, and are characterized by the clearness and simplicity of his\r\ndescriptions, which very closely resemble those of Hippocrates, and by\r\nthe soundness of the advice which he gives in regard to the methods\r\nof treatment.[36] In his conceptions of what a physician should aim\r\nto be, Aretaeus maintained a very high standard. Some of his views\r\nregarding human physiology and pathology are given here very briefly:\r\nRespiration serves the purpose of cooling the warmth of the heart, and\r\nthe lungs are therefore prompted by the latter organ to draw cool air\r\ninto their cavities; digestion takes place not only in the stomach\r\nbut also in the intestinal canal, and owes its origin to warmth; the\r\ncerebral nerves, close to the spot from which they originate, cross\r\nfrom one side to the other, and by the aid of this fact paralysis on\r\none side of the body may be explained. Aretaeus has gained considerable\r\nfame, says Puschmann, from his description of the “Syriac ulcer,” the\r\npicture of which he draws agreeing perfectly with what is known to-day\r\nas pharyngeal diphtheria. In various places throughout his writings\r\nhe displays a thorough knowledge of normal anatomy--as, for example,\r\nwhen he describes the ramifications of the vena portae and gall-ducts\r\nof the liver. He was also well informed in matters belonging to the\r\ndomain of pathology, for he gives admirable descriptions of many of\r\nthe diseases--for example, pleurisy with empyema, pneumonia, pulmonary\r\nconsumption, cerebral apoplexy, paraplegia, tetanus, epilepsy, diabetes\r\nmellitus, gout, etc. From the character of these descriptions one is\r\nstrongly tempted to believe that he must have made a certain number of\r\npostmortem examinations.\r\n\r\nAccording to Neuburger, Aretaeus enters very fully into details\r\nwhen he discusses the subject of diagnosis; his statements in one\r\nplace warranting the belief that he even auscultated the heart. His\r\nmethods of treatment were based largely upon his own experience and\r\nwere generally of a simple character. He attached great importance,\r\nfor example, to a very careful regulation of the diet, muscular\r\nexercise, massage, etc., and his employment of remedies was confined\r\nto a very small number of such drugs as exert a mild action. When the\r\ncase, however, was of such a character as to call for more vigorous\r\ninterference, he did not hesitate to resort to the use of opium,\r\nemetics, cathartics, venesection, blistering, the red-hot cautery iron,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nRufus, a native of Ephesus, a city of Asia Minor, about thirty-five\r\nmiles from Smyrna, is reckoned by most authorities among the Eclectics;\r\nin other words, he was an independent, or one who adopted from the\r\nteachings of the different sects such doctrines as met with his\r\napproval, but who, at the same time, did not care to pose as the\r\ndisciple of any one of them. He received his medical training at\r\nAlexandria, but it is not known where he practiced his profession.\r\nAlmost no details concerning his life or his professional career have\r\ncome down to our time. It is simply known that he flourished during\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Trajan (98–117 A. D.). Ebn Ali, an Arabian\r\nphysician and author, says that he was the leading medical authority\r\nof his time and that his works were highly esteemed by Galen. His\r\ntreatise on anatomy (entitled “The Names of the Different Parts of the\r\nHuman Body”), which is one of the few that have escaped destruction,\r\nis described as a treatise which was written for students, and which\r\npossesses great value for the history of anatomical nomenclature. The\r\nsame authority says that Rufus was the first to describe the chiasma,\r\nthat he came very near establishing the existence of two different\r\nkinds of nerves--motor and sensory--and that he attributed the control\r\nof all bodily functions to the nervous system. He also states that he\r\nwas one of the first to furnish a description of the oriental bubonic\r\nplague. Some idea of Rufus’ style of writing may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing quotations which have been taken from his short treatise\r\nentitled “The Questioning of Patients”:--[37]\r\n\r\n   It is necessary to question the patient, for by so doing one\r\n   may gather more exact information concerning the nature of the\r\n   malady, and will then be able to treat it more intelligently.\r\n   In this way also one may learn whether the patient’s mind is\r\n   in a normal or an excited state, and whether any change has\r\n   taken place in his physical strength. Some idea regarding the\r\n   nature and seat of the disease is usually obtained from such\r\n   questioning. If, for example, the patient answers clearly and to\r\n   the point, and does not hesitate; if his memory does not play\r\n   him false; if his speech is not thick or indistinct; if, being a\r\n   well-bred man, he gives his responses in a polite and cultivated\r\n   manner; or if, in the case of a person who is naturally timid,\r\n   the answers reflect this timidity, then you may feel confident\r\n   that your patient’s mind is not affected. But if, on the other\r\n   hand, you ask him about one thing and he gives you a reply about\r\n   something entirely different; if, as he talks, he appears to\r\n   forget what he was talking about; if he has a trembling tongue\r\n   the movements of which are also uncertain; and, finally, if from\r\n   a certain state of mind he passes rapidly to one of a totally\r\n   different character,--all these changes are evidences that the\r\n   brain is beginning to be affected.... If the patient speaks\r\n   distinctly and with a fairly strong voice, and is able to tell\r\n   his story without stopping from time to time in order to rest,\r\n   the inference is warranted that his physical strength is not\r\n   materially affected....\r\n\r\nThe following quotation is from his treatise on gout:--\r\n\r\n   If the patient complains that one of his joints is painful, he\r\n   should be asked whether or not the part has received a blow. If\r\n   he replies that it has not, then (you may infer that the pain\r\n   is due to gout and) you should forthwith put him on a suitable\r\n   diet, order a clyster and bleed him at a spot not far (from the\r\n   seat of the pain).... The withdrawal of nourishment is ordered\r\n   for the purpose of arresting any further formation of new blood\r\n   and thus preventing the joints from growing more sluggish in\r\n   their movements. The clyster is ordered because we believe that\r\n   it is beneficial (in this condition) to evacuate the bowels.\r\n   The bleeding will be found useful, but to a less degree in\r\n   the lower than in the upper limbs.... One must be careful not\r\n   to assume that the patient is cured when he has been entirely\r\n   relieved of his pain, because with the lapse of time fresh\r\n   attacks are liable to occur; this disease, like certain other\r\n   affections, possesses a periodic character.... Therefore it is\r\n   well, immediately after the bloodletting, to employ friction, to\r\n   get rid of the excess of moisture in the body by some laborious\r\n   form of exercise, to take such articles of food as are easily\r\n   digested,--in brief, to aim chiefly at reducing as much as\r\n   possible the moisture of the body.\r\n\r\nOne cannot but feel a keen regret that so few of the writings of this\r\nthoroughly practical and highly educated physician should have come\r\ndown to our time. So far as I am able to learn, Rufus wrote no fewer\r\nthan 102 treatises, all of which, with the exception of the seven\r\nabout to be mentioned (together with a number of fragments preserved\r\nby different writers of antiquity) have either disappeared or been\r\ndestroyed. The titles of the treatises which have been preserved are as\r\nfollows: (1) Diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder; (2) On Satyriasis and\r\nGonorrhoea; (3) Purgatives; (4) The Names of the Different Parts of the\r\nHuman Body; (5) On the Questioning of Patients; (6) On the Pulse; (7)\r\nOn Gout.\r\n\r\n_A General Survey of the Subject of Sects in Medicine._--During\r\nthe sixth century B. C.,--that is, about two hundred years before\r\nthe formation of the more distinctly medical sects of which mention\r\nwas made in Chapter IX.,--Pythagoras of Samos and his disciples put\r\nforward certain beliefs or doctrines with regard to the mode of\r\naction of some of the functions or vital processes of the human body,\r\nand all those who accepted these teachings as affording a true and\r\nsatisfactory explanation of the phenomena in question constituted what\r\nis generally termed a school or sect. Some of these individuals were\r\nphysicians--that is, men who undertook to cure or at least to relieve\r\nthose who were ill; but probably the majority were simply philosophers,\r\nmere “lovers of wisdom,” who by studying problems of this nature sought\r\nto satisfy their longing for a more perfect knowledge of the truth\r\nrespecting the various phenomena of life.\r\n\r\nA few years later, Heraclitus of Ephesus, who, like Pythagoras, was\r\nboth a philosopher and a practicing physician, taught the doctrine that\r\nall things owe their origin to fire. One is not at all surprised to\r\nlearn that he had relatively few followers, for history tells us that\r\nhe was both a misanthrope and a slanderer of the medical profession,\r\nas shown by the following saying which is attributed to him: “Next to\r\nphysicians the grammarians are the biggest fools in the world.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates attached much importance to the value of experience and\r\nto the necessity of studying disease at the bedside; at the same time\r\nhe upheld what is commonly known by the name of humoral pathology--a\r\ndoctrine which refers all maladies to some abnormal change in the\r\nhumors or fluid portions of the body. His writings also show that he\r\nmade full use of the reasoning power. The followers of this great\r\nphysician did not form a sect in the ordinary sense of the term; they\r\nwere his adherents simply because he was an able diagnostician, a\r\nsuccessful teacher, an excellent therapeutist, a skilful surgeon, a man\r\nof very high moral character,--in short, a great physician. Every sect\r\nwhich developed in the centuries following his death contained a goodly\r\nproportion of Hippocratists.\r\n\r\nNearly two centuries after the active period of the professional life\r\nof Hippocrates, Erasistratus and Herophilus gathered about themselves\r\nin Alexandria (about 280 B. C.) large groups of followers, who held for\r\ntheir respective teachers a degree of esteem which amounted, according\r\nto Galen, almost to veneration. As there was little or no antagonism\r\nor lack of harmony between the doctrines taught by these physicians,\r\nthe two groups cannot properly be classified among the sects. In\r\nfact, it would be more correct to say that Erasistratus and Herophilus\r\ncontributed facts of permanent value to our stock of knowledge rather\r\nthan doctrines which might prove highly popular for a few scores of\r\nyears, but which would probably in due course of time be set aside as\r\nno longer of value.\r\n\r\nThe four most characteristic types of sects in medicine were the\r\nfollowing: the Dogmatists--or Rationalists, as Daremberg calls them\r\nin one place; their great rivals, the Empirics; the Methodists; and\r\nthe Eclectics. The oldest sect, the Dogmatists, did not come into\r\nprominence until after the medical schools at Alexandria had already\r\nbeen in operation for a long time. The development of the rival sect of\r\nthe Empirics at this late period brought with it endless discussions\r\nregarding the merits of their respective teachings, and thus both of\r\nthem gained a degree of prominence which seems to us moderns to have\r\nbeen out of all proportion to the importance of the subject-matters\r\ndiscussed. The Dogmatists, says one writer, insisted that it is just as\r\nnecessary to be acquainted with the “hidden causes” of disease as with\r\nthose which are plainly recognizable, and that it is only by aid of the\r\nreasoning power that we gain some knowledge of this class of causes.\r\nThey claimed that, while a knowledge of anatomy is of very great\r\nservice to the surgeon, it usually renders this service through the aid\r\nof the reasoning power; as when, in the performance of a lithotomy, the\r\noperator selects the fleshy (_i.e._, vascular) neck of the bladder\r\nas the spot in which to make the opening with the knife, in preference\r\nto the base of the organ, which is chiefly membranous in structure and\r\ntherefore less likely to heal solidly.\r\n\r\nThe plausible but rather shallow response made by the Empirics to\r\nthe arguments advanced by their rivals consisted in quoting certain\r\nmaxims, as, for example: “The farmer and the helmsman do not acquire\r\nknowledge of their respective occupations from discussions, but from\r\nactual practice”; “It is not of vital importance to know what are the\r\ncauses of the different diseases, but what remedies are competent to\r\ncure them”; and “Diseases are not cured by eloquence, but by remedial\r\nagents.”\r\n\r\nAmong the comments made by Celsus with regard to the differences which\r\ndistinguished the Dogmatists from the Empirics we find the following\r\nstatement: “The two sects employed the same remedies and pursued very\r\nmuch the same course of treatment, but their reasonings about such\r\nmatters were different.”\r\n\r\nModern physicians will, at first thought, be disposed to wonder how men\r\nas clever as many of these physicians were could have split up into\r\nseparate and more or less antagonistic sects because of such apparently\r\ntrivial differences of opinion. It must be remembered, however, that\r\nthese men were groping in comparative darkness whenever they tried to\r\nadvance their knowledge of pathology, and that in this imperfect light\r\nmany things seemed of much greater importance than they appeared to be\r\nin the brighter light of later centuries. It is only fair, therefore,\r\nto withhold criticism and to ask ourselves whether this strong desire\r\non the part of those men to advance their knowledge of pathology--a\r\ndesire which manifested itself in the formation of sects--was not in\r\nreality an evidence of the great vitality of Greek medicine on Roman\r\nsoil in those early centuries.\r\n\r\nThe remarks made above with regard to the Dogmatists and the Empirics\r\napply in a general manner to the sects known as the Methodists and the\r\nEclectics, a sufficiently full account of which has been given in the\r\npreceding chapter.[38]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n           WELL-KNOWN MEDICAL AUTHORS OF THE EARLY CENTURIES\r\n                         OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were four men who were not especially identified with any of the\r\nsects described in the preceding chapters, and yet who occupied, as\r\nauthors of medical treatises, very prominent places in the history of\r\nmedicine of the period or epoch which we have just been considering.\r\nThey are Celsus, Scribonius Largus, Pliny the Elder and Dioscorides.\r\nThese men lived during the first and second centuries A. D. and they\r\ntherefore all belong strictly to the period which is designated in our\r\nscheme as the fourth epoch. I shall give here brief sketches of all of\r\nthese writers and of their works. While Caelius Aurelianus, another\r\nimportant medical author, belonged to a much later period, I shall, for\r\nreasons of convenience, describe in the same chapter with the others\r\nthe part which he played in the evolution of medicine.\r\n\r\nAulus Cornelius Celsus, called by some the Latin Hippocrates and by\r\nothers the Cicero of physicians because of the correctness and elegance\r\nof his Latin and the clear manner in which he puts his thoughts into\r\nwords, flourished during the reign of the Emperor Augustus (27 B.\r\nC.-14 A. D.). The date and place of his birth are not known, but it is\r\ngenerally believed that he was born and received his education at Rome.\r\nThe great work which he wrote and upon which he must have been engaged\r\nthe larger part of his lifetime was a sort of cyclopaedia, which\r\nbore the title “_Artium libri_,” and in which each department\r\nof knowledge was represented by a separate treatise. It is said that\r\nfive books were devoted to agriculture, seven to rhetoric, eight to\r\nmedicine, etc.; but all of these treatises, excepting those relating\r\nto the latter science, have been lost or destroyed. It is not certainly\r\nknown to which of the professions Celsus belonged, but the very skilful\r\nand judicious manner in which he has culled all that is best from the\r\nmedical treatises published before his time, the remarkable knowledge\r\nof technical details which he displays in every part of his own work,\r\nand the fine tone of medical thought which pervades these eight\r\nbooks, almost compel the conclusion that the author was a very clever\r\nclinician, although probably not a physician who practiced for a money\r\nreward. In no other published treatise is a more perfect picture of the\r\nmedical practice of antiquity to be found than that which Celsus gives\r\nus in his work “_De arte medica libri octo_.”\r\n\r\nIt is not an easy matter to select, from a treatise of several hundred\r\npages in length, one or two passages of such a character that they may\r\nbe accepted as fairly representing the author’s manner of dealing with\r\nmedical and surgical questions of practical interest. The two given\r\nbelow are translations from Védrènes’ version (Paris, 1876), and they\r\ndeal, the one with venesection and the other with the proper manner of\r\narresting hemorrhage from a wound. Both the passages quoted represent\r\nonly fragments, as sufficient space for more extensive extracts is not\r\navailable.\r\n\r\n   _Book II., Chapter X._--_Bloodletting from a\r\n   Vein._--Incising a vein for the purpose of drawing blood from\r\n   it, is not a new procedure; but it is certainly a new thing to\r\n   resort to bloodletting in almost all diseases. Again, it is an\r\n   ancient custom to employ bloodletting in young subjects and in\r\n   women who are not pregnant, but it is a new thing to perform\r\n   this operation on infants and aged individuals, and on women\r\n   approaching the period of confinement. It was the idea of the\r\n   ancients that persons at the two extremes of life were not able\r\n   to support this sort of treatment, and they were convinced that\r\n   a pregnant woman, if subjected to the operation of bloodletting,\r\n   would almost surely be confined before the completion of her\r\n   time. Since then, however, experience has shown that there is\r\n   no fixed rule about this matter, and that a physician should\r\n   preferably regulate his course in accordance with observations\r\n   of a different nature. The determining factor, for instance,\r\n   is neither the age nor the pregnant state of the patient, but\r\n   rather the degree of physical strength. In the case of a youth\r\n   who is feeble, or of a delicate woman (aside from the question\r\n   of pregnancy), it would be wrong to draw blood, for it would be\r\n   robbing them of what little strength they possessed. But, in the\r\n   case of a vigorous child, a robust old man, or a pregnant woman\r\n   who is in good health, one need not hesitate to resort to this\r\n   procedure. Nevertheless, there may arise, in connection with the\r\n   operation of venesection, a number of questions which are quite\r\n   likely to puzzle an inexperienced physician and perhaps lead him\r\n   into error. For example, infants and old people possess as a\r\n   rule diminished vigor, and the woman who is about to be confined\r\n   needs all her strength for the period following delivery, both\r\n   for herself and for the nourishing of the child. But the mere\r\n   fact that one must give some thought to questions of this nature\r\n   and must exercise prudence does not justify the immediate\r\n   rejection of a method of treatment like that of venesection. For\r\n   is it not the very essence of our art, not merely to consider\r\n   the factors of age and the pregnant state, but also to form an\r\n   estimate of that other and more important factor, viz., the\r\n   patient’s strength,--be that patient an infant, an aged person,\r\n   or a woman advanced in pregnancy,--and then to decide whether\r\n   it is, or is not, great enough to bear the loss of blood?\r\n   In deciding a question of this kind it will be necessary to\r\n   distinguish between real vigor and obesity, between thinness and\r\n   feebleness, etc.\r\n\r\n          *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   Venesection is an easy operation for a physician who has already\r\n   familiarized himself with the manner of performing it, but\r\n   for one who is ignorant of these details it may prove very\r\n   difficult. It is necessary, for example, to bear in mind that\r\n   the artery and vein are united and that they are accompanied\r\n   by nerves; and, further, that the injuring of the latter\r\n   will induce spasms and violent pains. On the other hand, it\r\n   must also not be forgotten that an artery once opened has no\r\n   disposition to close, nor does it heal, and that sometimes the\r\n   blood escapes in an impetuous manner. If, perchance, the vein\r\n   is cut transversely, the edges of the opening contract and no\r\n   more blood escapes. Again, if the scalpel is plunged into the\r\n   parts timidly, the skin alone will be divided and the vein will\r\n   not be opened. In some cases this vessel is so hidden from\r\n   sight that the physician may experience difficulty in bringing\r\n   it into view. Thus it will be seen that there are several\r\n   circumstances which may render this operation difficult for an\r\n   ignorant or inexperienced physician. The vein should be incised\r\n   in a longitudinal direction, midway between its two sides. The\r\n   moment the blood gushes from the opening its color and general\r\n   appearance should be carefully noted, etc.\r\n\r\n   _Book V., Chapter XXVI._--_The Proper Manner of Arresting\r\n   Hemorrhage from a Wound._--If there is fear that there\r\n   may be bleeding, one should fill the wound with dry lint,\r\n   place over it a sponge wrung out of cold water, and press\r\n   upon it with the hand. If the bleeding still continues, it is\r\n   advisable to change the stuffing of lint somewhat frequently;\r\n   and, if this step proves ineffective, then lint moistened with\r\n   vinegar may be tried, for this liquid acts energetically in\r\n   arresting hemorrhage. Some physicians, indeed, actually pour\r\n   it into the wound. There is a strong objection, however, to\r\n   the use of an agent which, like vinegar, arrests the bleeding\r\n   too completely--viz., that it is apt to set up afterwards an\r\n   intense inflammation of the parts. The same reasoning applies\r\n   with even greater force to the employment of corrosives and\r\n   caustics, which produce an eschar. Despite the effectiveness\r\n   of most of these in arresting hemorrhage, their use should be\r\n   discouraged.... Finally, if the bleeding continues it will be\r\n   necessary to grasp the vessel from which the blood is escaping,\r\n   to ligature it in two places close to the wound, and then to\r\n   divide the vessel between the two ligatures, in order that\r\n   it may retract (both of the new orifices having already been\r\n   closed by the ligatures). If the circumstances are such that the\r\n   plan just recommended cannot be carried out, it will then be\r\n   advisable to apply the red-hot cautery to the bleeding vessel.\r\n   When a rather free hemorrhage occurs at a part of the body where\r\n   there are no nerve trunks and no muscles,--as on the forehead or\r\n   at the top of the head,--the simplest plan is to apply a cup at\r\n   some little distance from the source of the bleeding and thus\r\n   divert the current of the blood from the spot affected.\r\n\r\nAnd to these two longer extracts may be added a third:--\r\n\r\n   From these considerations the inference is warranted that a\r\n   physician cannot possibly give proper attention to a large\r\n   number of patients. (Book III., Chapter IV.)\r\n\r\nCelsus’ treatise was ignored by physicians for many centuries, but\r\nit was considered by the monks, in the Middle Ages, a valuable\r\nguide in the treatment of disease; and it was probably owing to\r\nthis circumstance, says Védrènes, that the book did not altogether\r\ndisappear. It was not until the year 1443 that Thomas de Sazanne,\r\nafterward Pope Nicholas V., discovered a copy of the work in the church\r\nof Saint Ambrosius, at Milan, but it was only in 1478 that the book was\r\nprinted for the first time (at Florence). Then, as if to make up for\r\nthe long neglect to which it had been subjected, no fewer than sixty\r\nLatin editions were issued during the two succeeding centuries; and,\r\nin addition, it was eventually translated into every modern European\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nScribonius Largus, a Roman physician who lived during the reigns\r\nof Tiberius and Claudius (14–54 A. D.), owes his celebrity to the\r\nfact that he wrote and published (in 47 A. D.) a book containing a\r\ncollection of the best medical formulae and popular recipes known at\r\nthat time. He appears to have had a large private practice and to have\r\nspent a considerable portion of his professional life in the service\r\nof the army. He accompanied the Emperor Claudius, for example, in his\r\ncampaign against Britain (43 A. D.), and the book which he wrote, and\r\nwhich has just been mentioned, was dedicated by him to that emperor.\r\nAccording to Neuburger, Scribonius is to be credited with having been\r\nthe first to describe correctly the proper manner of obtaining the drug\r\nknown as opium, and also the first to recommend, in the treatment of\r\nsevere headaches, the employment of electric shocks as communicated by\r\nthe fish called the “electric ray.”\r\n\r\nMedical practice at that period, says Le Clerc, was divided among three\r\nkinds of practitioners--those who treated their cases exclusively by\r\ndietetic measures, those who effected cures by surgical means, and\r\nthose who took charge only of such patients as required chiefly the\r\nemployment of external remedies. But Scribonius Largus insists that\r\nsuch a division was more theoretical than real, as no one of these\r\nclasses could get along without the cooperation of the others.\r\n\r\nC. Plinius Secundus, commonly called Pliny the Elder, was born near the\r\nbeginning of the first century of the Christian era, either at Verona\r\nor at Como in the north of Italy, and settled in Rome at an early\r\nperiod of his life. At the beginning of his career he served for some\r\ntime in the army in Germany, and upon his return to Rome practiced as\r\na pleader. Subsequently he held various official positions which gave\r\nhim the opportunity of visiting other countries of Europe. He perished\r\nat Stabiae (near the modern Castellamare, on the Gulf of Naples) in 79\r\nA. D., at the age of fifty-six years, while watching the eruption of\r\nVesuvius, which overwhelmed Herculaneum and Pompeii. He was in command\r\nof the Roman fleet at the time.\r\n\r\nPliny was indefatigable as a writer and as a gatherer of knowledge of\r\nall sorts, and he and Celsus are well named the Encyclopaedists. He\r\nis said to have written twenty books on the war with the Germans, an\r\nunknown number on rhetoric and grammar, and thirty-seven on natural\r\nhistory. The latter books alone have come down to our time. Pliny’s\r\nnephew, who is known as Pliny the Younger, and who edited the great\r\nwork of his uncle on natural history, furnishes us, in a letter\r\naddressed to the historian Tacitus, with some interesting details\r\nregarding the elder Pliny’s manner of life. It appears from this\r\naccount, that the latter read almost incessantly. During his meals and\r\nwhile he was taking his bath, an attendant read aloud to him. He also\r\ntook his books with him on his travels and was always accompanied by\r\na person who could write rapidly under dictation. He continued this\r\npractice upon his return to Rome and dictated to his amanuensis even\r\nwhile he was being carried about in a sedan chair. Books 20–27 of his\r\ngreat work on natural history are devoted to the subject of remedial\r\nagents belonging to the vegetable kingdom, books 28–32 deal with those\r\nwhich belong to the animal kingdom, and books 33–37 treat of mineralogy\r\nwith special reference to medicine, painting and sculpture. Pliny was a\r\ncompiler and not an original investigator. Some idea of the popularity\r\nof his treatise on natural history may be gathered from the fact that\r\nit was the second book to be printed after the invention of printing,\r\nthe Bible being the first. Another interesting fact connected with\r\nPliny’s treatise is mentioned by Neuburger, viz., that the use of\r\nhyoscyamus and belladonna as agents capable of dilating the pupils,\r\nowed its origin to the discovery (by C. Himly, in 1800) of a place in\r\nthe text (Book XXV., 92) where it is stated that the juice of the plant\r\nAnagallis was rubbed into the eyes before the operation for cataract\r\nwas undertaken.\r\n\r\nAccording to Pliny (Book XXXI., Chapter VI.), the ancients employed\r\nmineral waters extensively in the form of baths, and they also\r\noccasionally used them as internal remedies. Galen, too, mentions the\r\nfact that these waters were in demand in the spring or autumn for\r\npurgative purposes.\r\n\r\nIn Book XXXIX., 8, 3, Pliny--as quoted by Védrènes--makes the following\r\nremarks:--\r\n\r\n   Very few Romans have shown an active interest in medical\r\n   affairs, and those few speedily found it necessary to pass\r\n   themselves off as Greeks. For it is a well-known fact that those\r\n   physicians who, without being able to speak Greek, attempted to\r\n   build up a practice in Rome, failed to gain the confidence of\r\n   their patients, even of those who were not at all familiar with\r\n   that language.... When one’s health is the question at issue the\r\n   readiness to place confidence in a medical adviser is apt to\r\n   diminish in proportion as one’s knowledge of the man increases.\r\n   Indeed, medicine is the only art in which one is quite ready\r\n   at first to put faith in almost anybody who calls himself a\r\n   physician, and that too, despite the acknowledged fact that in\r\n   no other circumstances of life is an imposture more fraught with\r\n   danger.\r\n\r\nEnglish versions of Pliny’s Natural History and of Pliny the Younger’s\r\nLetters have been published in what is known as Bohn’s Libraries.\r\n\r\nPedanius Dioscorides, a native of Anazarba, a small Greek town near\r\nTarsus in Cilicia, lived about the middle of the first century A. D.\r\n(during the reigns of Nero and Vespasian). From his earliest youth he\r\ntook a great interest in botany, and, after reaching manhood, traveled\r\nextensively in the wake of different Roman armies, for the sole purpose\r\nof studying by direct observation the plants of different countries\r\nand of verifying the medicinal virtues which each one was reputed to\r\npossess. In this way he visited, in turn, Greece, Italy, Asia Minor\r\nand perhaps also the southern portion of France (the Narbonaise). He\r\ncollected great quantities of specimens of every kind of drug--animal\r\nand mineral substances as well as objects belonging to the vegetable\r\nkingdom; and, wherever it was possible to do so, he wrote memoranda of\r\nthe traditions of the natives with regard to the uses and medicinal\r\neffects of these different drugs. After he had completed all these\r\nresearches and had gathered together all this vast mass of materials,\r\nhe wrote his famous treatise on materia medica--“the most complete,\r\nthe best considered, and the most useful work of its kind to be found\r\nanywhere to-day.” (Galen.) It is from this treatise, therefore, says\r\nDezeimeris, that one can derive the most satisfactory idea of the\r\nearly Greek materia medica; but at the same time, he adds, it is not\r\na book in which will be found a detailed account of the manner in\r\nwhich the practitioners of that period employed the remedies which he\r\ndescribes. The same authority calls attention to the great difficulty\r\nwhich modern physicians often experience in their attempts to identify\r\nthe drugs which Dioscorides describes. Le Clerc calls attention to\r\nthe fact that the physicians who were contemporaries of Dioscorides\r\nwere not in the habit of employing either iron or antimony (called by\r\nthem _stibium_) internally. Apparently they had not yet learned\r\nthat these substances possess properties which exert a curative action\r\nin certain diseases. On the other hand, he mentions the manner of\r\nextracting quicksilver, by chemical means, from cinnabar [red sulphide\r\nof mercury], the steps required for preparing acetate of lead, and the\r\nproper way of making lime water.\r\n\r\nThe work to which reference has been made above was published by\r\nDioscorides about the year 77 A. D. It is the earliest pharmacological\r\ntreatise that has come down to our time, and for many succeeding\r\ncenturies it served as the authoritative guide in all questions\r\nrelating to drugs. The first printed edition of the Greek original\r\nappeared in Venice in 1499, but a still earlier Latin version was\r\nissued in 1478. According to Pagel the best edition (in Latin and\r\nfully illustrated) is that of Pietro Andrea Mattioli, which was printed\r\nin Venice in 1554. Neuburger commends highly the German version by J.\r\nBerendes. (Stuttgart, 1902.)\r\n\r\nOf Caelius Aurelianus we possess no biographical details beyond the\r\nfacts that he was a native of Sicca in Numidia, Africa, and that he\r\nlived toward the end of the fourth or during the first part of the\r\nfifth century of the present era. He was the author of several works,\r\nall but one of which, however, have been lost. The single treatise\r\nwhich has come down to our time treats of acute and chronic diseases,\r\nand is spoken of by Daremberg as being virtually a translation of\r\none of the lost writings of Soranus. This book, says Haeser in his\r\nHistory of Medicine, is the most important source from which our\r\nknowledge of Methodism is derived; and Neuburger not only agrees with\r\nthis statement, but adds that the treatise of Caelius Aurelianus\r\nplayed a most important part, toward the end of the Middle Ages, in\r\nthe evolution of medicine. Up to the present time no translation of\r\nthis work into any modern language has been published, but Neuburger\r\nfurnishes a very full analysis of its important parts. In two places,\r\nas appears from this analysis, Caelius Aurelianus mentions--among\r\nthe signs and symptoms of certain affections of the respiratory\r\napparatus--phenomena which show beyond a doubt that he (or Soranus) was\r\nfamiliar with auscultation of the chest. The words which he uses are\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n“_Stridor vel sonitus interius resonans aut sibilans in ea parte quae\r\npatitur,” and “sibilatus vehemens atque asper in ultimo etiam pectoris\r\nresonans stridor._”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                            CLAUDIUS GALEN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the centuries immediately preceding the Christian era, Greek\r\nmedicine was represented by a collection of treatises which had been\r\nwritten by Hippocrates and his followers on anatomical, physiological,\r\npathological, therapeutical and ethical subjects, and which constituted\r\na fairly complete but not always easily intelligible system. As\r\ntime went on, however, and especially as new and useful facts were\r\nconstantly being added to the existing stock of medical knowledge,\r\nthe more thoughtful physicians began to feel that the system, which\r\nup to that day had proved acceptable, needed to be perfected in a\r\nnumber of respects; and accordingly, as a result of this feeling of\r\ndissatisfaction, and also as an expression of the prevailing desire\r\nfor a more perfect knowledge of the truth, there developed, as has\r\nbeen stated in the preceding chapters, a number of different medical\r\nsects. When Galen first appeared in the field as a physician of unusual\r\npromise, these various sects were all still in a thriving condition.\r\nThe Methodists, in particular, were very popular. Galen did not favor\r\nany special sect, but in his writings he made it manifest that he\r\nattached more importance to the teachings of Hippocrates than to those\r\nof any other author. “It was Hippocrates,” he said, “who laid the real\r\nfoundations of the science of medicine.” It is therefore not surprising\r\nthat Galen should have devoted so much time to the writing of elaborate\r\ncommentaries on the works of Hippocrates. The service which he thus\r\nrendered to medicine, says Daremberg, was of very great value. But\r\nGalen, notwithstanding his great admiration for Hippocrates, did not\r\nhesitate to criticise a number of his teachings, and especially those\r\nwhich, as he believed, were not stated with sufficient clearness.\r\nValuable as was the service rendered to medicine by the writing of\r\nthese commentaries, there still remained an urgent need for a service\r\nof a different and much more difficult kind, viz., that of welding\r\ntogether into a single clearly written and easily intelligible system\r\nof medicine, all that was good in the Hippocratic writings and in the\r\ndisconnected and at times antagonistic teachings of the sects. To\r\naccomplish this successfully required the services of a man endowed\r\nwith mental gifts of a most exceptional character--complete knowledge\r\nof medicine in all its departments, a mind thoroughly trained in\r\nphilosophy, the power to express his thoughts in simple language,\r\nand an independence and fairness of judgment which would render him\r\nindifferent to the petty interests of the sects. Claudius Galen, as\r\nsubsequent events showed, possessed these very gifts in a high degree,\r\nand he devoted the better part of his reasonably long lifetime to the\r\naccomplishment of this much-needed work. How greatly it was needed at\r\nthat particular period of time, nobody then knew or could even suspect.\r\nIt soon appeared, however, that all the vaunted civilization of the\r\nGraeco-Roman world--much of it of the purest gold and a great deal\r\nof the basest alloy--was to be swept so completely off the face of\r\nthe earth that, for thirteen hundred or more years, almost no thought\r\nwhatever could possibly be given to the science and art of medicine.\r\nFortunate, most fortunate it was, therefore, that, before this wave\r\nof destruction reached Rome, all the best part of Greek medical\r\nliterature--for such it was in truth--had been gathered together and\r\ncarefully systematized by Galen and stowed away in the recesses and\r\nchambers of remotely situated monasteries and churches by clear-sighted\r\nmonks for the benefit of later generations of physicians.\r\n\r\n_Brief Biographical Sketch._--Claudius Galen was born in Pergamum,\r\nan important Greek city of Asia Minor, about the year 131 A. D., under\r\nthe reign of the Emperor Hadrian. His father, whose name was Nicon,\r\nwas a man of ample means, well informed in philosophy, astronomy and\r\ngeometry, and most liberal in providing for the thorough education of\r\nhis son in every branch of useful knowledge. In two or three places\r\nin his writings Galen speaks of his father in terms of affection. On\r\nthe other hand, he does not hesitate to state in the plainest language\r\npossible that his mother was a veritable Xanthippe. In her moments of\r\nbad temper she would not only shout and scream in a violent manner, but\r\nwould sometimes go so far as to bite her serving-maids. Pergamum, at\r\nthe time of which I am writing, offered unusually good opportunities\r\nfor studying disease. Its Asclepieion, which was built during Galen’s\r\nboyhood, had already become one of the famous temples of Asia Minor,\r\nand the sick and maimed flocked to it in large numbers. Then, in\r\naddition, the city was well equipped with able physicians, who appear,\r\naccording to Neuburger, to have been on very friendly terms with the\r\npriests of the temple. It was under the guidance of such men that\r\nGalen--at the early age of seventeen, and after a careful training in\r\nphilosophy, mathematics, etc.--began the study of medicine. He speaks\r\nwith special interest and respect of one of his instructors, a certain\r\nQuintus, who had the reputation of being an excellent anatomist and at\r\nthe same time one of the most distinguished practitioners of that day.\r\nAnother anatomist, Styrus, was also one of Galen’s teachers.\r\n\r\nOn the death of his father Galen left his home and devoted the\r\nsucceeding nine years to visiting all the different cities in which\r\nhe believed he might gain some additional knowledge in medicine and\r\nsurgery. A large part of this long period was spent in Alexandria,\r\nwhich still retained much of its importance as a home of all the\r\nsciences. On attaining his twenty-eighth year he left that city and\r\nreturned to Pergamum, evidently with the purpose of establishing\r\nhimself there in the regular practice of his profession. Through\r\nthe influence of the temple officials, and especially of the High\r\nPriest, Galen received the appointment of physician to the gladiators,\r\na position which he held with credit for a period of four years,\r\nand which afforded him excellent opportunities for cultivating his\r\nknowledge of surgery. It was while he was serving in this capacity\r\nthat he devised and put into practice a method of saturating the\r\ndressings (in cases of severe wounds) with red wine, for the purpose\r\nof preventing the development of inflammation in the parts affected;\r\nand the success which he thus obtained was so great that not one of the\r\ngladiators intrusted to his care died from his wounds. History does\r\nnot state the precise manner in which Galen carried out his method of\r\nutilizing wine in the dressing of wounds, and we are therefore unable\r\nto determine just how much credit he was entitled to receive for this\r\ncrude but apparently effective means of securing local antisepsis.\r\nIt is clear, however, that Galen’s treatment could only have been a\r\nmodification of a much older method, for Jesus, in his answer to a\r\nquestion put to him by a lawyer, said: “But a certain Samaritan, as he\r\njourneyed, came where he (the injured man) was: and when he saw him,\r\nhe had compassion on him, and went to him, and bound up his wounds,\r\npouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, ...” (St. Luke\r\nx., 33, 34).\r\n\r\nAt the end of four years there broke out in Pergamum a riot which\r\nrendered residence there, at least for a certain length of time,\r\nundesirable. Accordingly Galen, who was now thirty-two years old,\r\nand who was probably glad of an excuse for leaving a place where a\r\nphysician of his education and talents had so few opportunities for\r\ngaining distinction, decided to visit Rome, and--if circumstances\r\nappeared to favor the plan--to settle there. His first impressions\r\nafter arriving in that metropolis were favorable to the plan of\r\nestablishing himself there permanently, but at the end of a few years\r\nhe became conscious of the growing hostility of those practitioners\r\nwho had been for a longer time than he well established in that city.\r\nThis hostility increased as he rose in favor and esteem with people\r\nof position and influence. He had treated skilfully and with success\r\nEudemus, a peripatetic philosopher of great celebrity, for a quartan\r\nfever. He had also cured the wife of Boëthus (a patrician who belonged\r\nto the consular class) of a serious illness and had received as an\r\nexpression of appreciation a gift of four hundred pieces of gold. He\r\nhad won the friendship and esteem of such men as Sergius Paulus, the\r\nPraetor; of Barbaras, the uncle of the Emperor Lucius; and of Severus,\r\nwho was at that time Consul, but who later became Emperor. These very\r\ninfluential men took an active interest in Galen’s scientific work,\r\nhaving been invited by him on more than one occasion to witness his\r\ndissections of apes,--dissections which he made for the particular\r\npurpose of demonstrating the organs of respiration and of the voice.\r\nAll these facts soon became known to Galen’s rivals and probably helped\r\nto fan the spark of their envy into a flame; but it is very doubtful\r\nwhether he was justified in saying that the ill feeling thus engendered\r\nthreatened to end in some act of personal violence, for which reason\r\nhe decided to leave Rome and return to Pergamum. His secret manner\r\nof departure, without taking leave of anybody, and the fact that the\r\nPlague was just at that time rapidly approaching Rome, justify the\r\nbelief, says Neuburger, that it was not fear of personal violence at\r\nthe hands of his jealous rivals that drove Galen away so mysteriously\r\nfrom the city in which, in the short space of four or five years,\r\nhe had won so great professional success, but an unwillingness to\r\nface his duty, which was, to remain and aid in the approaching fight\r\nagainst the great destroyer--the Plague. If Galen had been a simple\r\nphysician, one of the great body of medical practitioners in Rome, no\r\none would be disposed to question the justice of the criticism which\r\nthe distinguished Viennese historian makes of his decision to abandon\r\nthat city at the moment of her distress and peril. But, as a matter\r\nof fact, Galen was not a practitioner of medicine in the full sense\r\nof that term. He treated cases of illness because in no other way\r\nwould it be possible for him to acquire the necessary familiarity with\r\ndisease; but, almost from the very beginning, he seems to have fully\r\nrealized that he was destined to devote his time and his energies to\r\na very different kind of professional work,--work which was urgently\r\nneeded, which promised to be of very great value to medical science,\r\nand which probably no other physician then living was competent to do\r\neffectively. Furthermore, he was himself profoundly conscious that the\r\nwork in question constituted the main object of his life. His own words\r\n(see his statement with reference to Archigenes, on page 174) show\r\nthis plainly, and the huge mass of medical treatises which he wrote\r\nreveal in the most unmistakable manner with what untiring persistency\r\nhe pursued the path which he believed it was his duty to follow. It\r\nbeing assumed, then, that such were the motives which actuated Galen,\r\nwas it a mistake on his part to conclude that duty did not require him\r\nto remain in Rome? The question is a difficult one to answer, and I do\r\nnot feel called upon to decide it. We do not, however, brand a general\r\nin the army a coward because he endeavors to protect himself as much\r\nas possible from danger during a battle, that he may be able, to the\r\nvery end, to direct the soldiers under his command. Similarly, was not\r\nGalen justified in avoiding every risk which was likely to imperil the\r\nperformance of duties which were of far greater value to medicine and\r\nto humanity at large than that of acting as a mere soldier in the ranks\r\nof medical men?\r\n\r\nIt seems a great pity that one of the most inspiring figures in the\r\nhistory of medicine should be represented to posterity with such a\r\nblemish upon his character, and I have therefore ventured to suggest a\r\npossible defense of Galen’s action.\r\n\r\nNot very long after he had returned to Pergamum, Galen was summoned\r\nby the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus, who were then with\r\nthe army at Aquileia, a few miles north of the present Trieste, to\r\njoin them at that city; and he was, of course, obliged to obey. A\r\nfresh outbreak of the Plague had occurred and there had already been\r\nmany fatal cases among the troops. It was therefore decided by the\r\nemperors, almost immediately after Galen’s arrival, to return to Rome\r\nwith a part of the army. A start was accordingly made, and the company\r\nhad already advanced some distance on their way, when Lucius Verus\r\ndied. This unexpected event greatly increased the difficulties of\r\nthe return journey, as it was deemed necessary to carry the remains\r\nof the deceased Emperor back to the imperial city. Thus Galen found\r\nhimself once more settled in Rome, this time in the capacity of private\r\nphysician to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his sons Commodus and\r\nSextus. The position was extremely well adapted to the needs of Galen,\r\nwho, from that time forward, for a period of several years, had at his\r\ndisposal ample time for writing and for conducting his experimental\r\nwork in anatomy and physiology, a privilege of which he appears to have\r\nmade excellent use. He lived to be seventy years of age, his death\r\noccurring during the latter part of the reign of Severus, or at the\r\nbeginning of that of Caracalla (about 201 A. D.).\r\n\r\nAll Galen’s critics agree that he possessed his full share of\r\npeculiarities,--not to call them by the harsher name of faults. He was\r\nconstantly ready, for example, to praise his own doings and sayings,\r\nand he rarely lost an opportunity of holding up the physicians of Rome\r\nto ridicule and contempt. He was specially bitter in his criticisms of\r\nMethodism and its adherents--“the donkeys of Thessalus,” as he called\r\nthem. At the same time, no other physician of ancient or modern times\r\nhas manifested to an equal degree such extraordinary industry as a\r\nwriter and original investigator in a great variety of departments of\r\nknowledge. Although many of his works have been lost,[39] those which\r\nhave come down to our time are still very numerous--“a sufficient\r\nnumber,” says Neuburger, “to constitute a library by themselves.” I\r\ngive here a few of the titles of these works, in order that the reader\r\nmay get at least some idea of the great variety of medical topics which\r\nGalen has discussed in his writings. The more complete list furnished\r\nby Daniel Le Clerc contains nearly two hundred titles, and yet even\r\nthis is believed to fall short of the actual number.\r\n\r\n\r\n            SELECTED LIST OF THE WORKS OF GALEN RELATING TO\r\n                      MEDICINE.

The most available\r\nedition of his works in Greek is that of Karl Gottlob Kühn of Leipzig\r\n(1821–1828; 22 Vols. of about 1000 pages each). There is scarcely a\r\ndepartment which this great physician has not treated quite fully. But,\r\nunfortunately, the translations into modern languages are relatively\r\nfew, and they cover only small portions of the entire work. That\r\nof Daremberg, entitled “_Oeuvres anatomiques, physiologiques et\r\nmédicales de Galien, etc._” (Paris, 1854–1857; 2 Vols.), is in every\r\nway most satisfactory, and it is from this source that I have made a\r\nfew extracts--just sufficient to give the reader some idea of Galen’s\r\nstyle of writing and of his competency to deal with such subjects as\r\nhuman anatomy and physiology. To attempt anything like a complete\r\nexposition of his views regarding pathology, therapeutics, hygiene,\r\netc., would necessitate my devoting more space to this part of the\r\nhistory of medicine than I can afford to give. To those who desire to\r\nobtain more ample information about Galen’s views regarding pathology\r\nand therapeutics I would recommend a study of Daremberg’s admirable\r\nwork and a perusal of the careful analysis made by Neuburger of certain\r\nportions of Galen’s text.\r\n\r\n_Galen’s Contributions to Anatomy and Physiology._--At the\r\nperiod of time about which I am now writing, and for many centuries\r\nafterward, there existed among all classes of the community a very\r\nstrong prejudice against dissecting human corpses. And even Galen\r\nhimself appears to have shared this prejudice, for, in spite of his\r\nintense eagerness to gain a more perfect knowledge of human anatomy, he\r\napparently did not dare to undertake any such investigation, even when\r\na favorable opportunity for so doing presented itself, as it did on the\r\noccasion to which he refers in the following brief extract taken from\r\none of his treatises:--\r\n\r\n   A carelessly constructed sepulchre on the banks of a river had\r\n   been undermined during a season of flood, and the corpse thus\r\n   set free had floated down stream a short distance, until it\r\n   finally lodged on the shore of a small cove. Passing near by I\r\n   had the opportunity of inspecting this corpse. The fleshy parts\r\n   had already disappeared to a great extent through the process\r\n   of decomposition, but the bones were still held together by\r\n   their fibrous connections. The picture presented to the eye was\r\n   that of a human skeleton specially prepared for the instruction\r\n   of young physicians. On another occasion, a few steps from the\r\n   main road, I came across the dead body of a robber who had been\r\n   killed by the traveler whose money he had attempted to steal.\r\n   The peasants of that neighborhood were not willing to bury the\r\n   corpse of such a bad man, and they accordingly allowed it to\r\n   remain at the spot where it was first discovered. In the course\r\n   of the following two days, as might be expected, the vultures\r\n   removed every particle of flesh from the bones, so that, when\r\n   I saw what remained of the body, the only thing visible was a\r\n   nicely cleaned skeleton.\r\n                      (Le Clerc: _Histoire de la Médecine_, p. 711.)\r\n\r\nHere were two excellent opportunities for gaining the additional\r\nknowledge of human anatomy which Galen so much desired, but he\r\nevidently was not at all disposed to avail himself of them--doubtless\r\nbecause his mind was deeply imbued with the feeling that any such\r\ninterference on his part would be a sacrilegious act. Under the\r\ncircumstances, therefore, there was nothing left for him to do but\r\nto utilize animals for purposes of dissection, and more particularly\r\napes, whose anatomy very closely resembles that of the human being.\r\nSeveral of Galen’s books on anatomy have come down to our time, but\r\nquite a number of others have been lost. From those which we possess,\r\nand especially from the one entitled “Anatomical Administrations,”\r\nit is permissible to conclude that he was a most skilful dissector\r\nand an extremely close and careful observer, and that he was very\r\nparticular to set down the results of his observations in admirably\r\nclear language. Indeed, Le Clerc assures us that Vesalius, the great\r\nFlemish anatomist of the sixteenth century, bestowed high praise upon\r\nGalen’s anatomical descriptions; and that, too, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that the latter sometimes erred in his statements regarding the\r\nsimilarity between certain parts observed in dissections of an animal\r\nand the corresponding parts in man. In one of his treatises[40] Galen\r\nstates distinctly that the arteries contain blood. In another he gives\r\na remarkably full and accurate description of the nervous system,\r\nincluding the brain, spinal cord, and many of the nerves.\r\n\r\n   He describes the optic nerve, the oculo-motorius and\r\n   trochlearis, the different ramifications of the trigeminus, the\r\n   acusticus and facialis, the vagus and glossopharyngeus, the\r\n   nerves of the pharynx and larynx, the sympatheticus (with the\r\n   accompanying ganglia), and the radial, ulnar, median, crural and\r\n   ischiatic nerves. (Puschmann.)\r\n\r\nAlthough it is true that certain important anatomical and physiological\r\nfacts are found recorded for the first time in the works of Galen,\r\nthis must not be accepted as evidence that Galen himself is the real\r\ndiscoverer of these facts. The most that can be claimed for him is that\r\nhe is the first writer to bring the facts in question to the knowledge\r\nof us moderns. When the ancient books that have been lost are once\r\nmore brought to light, as they very well may be at any time, we shall\r\nbe able, perhaps, to give credit where credit is due. But there is one\r\ndepartment in which Galen did experimental work of an entirely original\r\ncharacter and for which he deserves unstinted praise. I refer to the\r\nexperiments which he made concerning the physiology of the brain and\r\nspinal cord. They are related in the following extract, which has been\r\ntranslated from the account given by Neuburger (_op. cit._, Vol.\r\nI., p. 380):--\r\n\r\n   The brain itself is not sensitive; it expands and contracts\r\n   synchronously with the respiratory movements, the purpose of\r\n   which action is to drive the pneuma from the cavities of that\r\n   organ into the nerves. The function of the meninges is to hold\r\n   the parts firmly together and to unite the blood-vessels.\r\n   Pressure upon the brain causes stupor. An injury of the tissues\r\n   surrounding the fourth ventricle or of those which constitute\r\n   the beginning of the spinal cord produces death. The seat of\r\n   the soul is in the substance of the brain, and not in its\r\n   membranes. The spinal cord serves as a conductor of sensation\r\n   and of motor impulses, and it also plays the part of a brain\r\n   for those structures of the body which lie below the head.\r\n   It gives off nerves like streamlets. Division of the spinal\r\n   cord longitudinally in its median axis does not give rise to\r\n   paralysis. Transverse division, on the other hand, causes\r\n   symmetrical paralyses. If the cord is divided between the third\r\n   and fourth cervical vertebrae, respiration is arrested, and\r\n   if the division is made between the cervical and the thoracic\r\n   portions of the spinal column, the animal breathes with the aid\r\n   only of its diaphragm and of the upper muscles of the trunk of\r\n   the body. Division of the recurrent nerves produces aphonia; if\r\n   the fifth cervical nerve is divided, the scapular muscles on\r\n   the corresponding side will be paralyzed. Galen considers the\r\n   ganglia to be organs for reinforcing the energy of the nerves.\r\n   The fact that both cerebral and spinal-cord nerve-filaments\r\n   enter into the composition of the sympathetic nerve explains the\r\n   extraordinary sensitiveness of the abdominal organs.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that these experiments are the first of their kind\r\nof which history makes mention, that they were carried out nearly\r\nseventeen hundred years ago, and that--so far as we know--they sprang\r\nentirely from the brain of the experimenter, we may well express\r\nunlimited admiration for Claudius Galen.\r\n\r\nDaniel Le Clerc says that Galen’s principal treatise on human\r\nphysiology, entitled “Utility of the Different Parts of the Human\r\nBody,” constitutes a _chef-d’oeuvre_ which has challenged the\r\nadmiration of physicians and philosophers in all ages. Christians,\r\nhowever, he adds, are particularly gratified to learn from this work\r\nthat “Galen, although classed as a Pagan, unhesitatingly recognizes\r\nthat it was an all-wise, an all-powerful, an all-good God who created\r\nman and all the other animals.” Further on, Le Clerc refers to another\r\nstatement which was made by Galen and which will be found on page 261\r\nof Daremberg’s version. It reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   If I were to spend any more time in talking about such\r\n   brutes--by which term he designates men who cannot appreciate\r\n   the wisdom of God in distributing the different parts of the\r\n   body in the manner in which He has done this--I should justly\r\n   incur the blame of sensible persons. They would accuse me of\r\n   desecrating the account which I am writing, an account which is\r\n   intended as a hymn of sincere praise of the Creator of man. I\r\n   believe that true piety consists, not in sacrificing numberless\r\n   hecatombs nor in burning unlimited quantities of incense and a\r\n   thousand perfumes, but in first searching out and then making\r\n   known to my fellow men how great are the wisdom, the power, and\r\n   the goodness of the Creator.\r\n\r\nGalen’s work on “The Utility of the Different Parts of the Human Body”\r\nis composed of seventeen books, all of which exist to-day in a complete\r\nstate. Taken together they form, as may be seen by the following list\r\nof contents, a remarkably complete treatise on physiology. Books I. and\r\nII. are devoted to the hand, forearm and arm (105 pages); Book III. to\r\nthe thigh, leg and foot (62 pages); Books IV. and V. to the alimentary\r\norgans and their accessories (101 pages); Book VI. to the respiratory\r\norgans (78 pages); Book VII. to the organs of the voice (67 pages);\r\nBook VIII. to the head, the encephalon and the organs of special sense\r\n(45 pages); Book IX. to the cranium, the encephalon and the cranial\r\nnerves (38 pages); Book X. to the eyes and their accessories (45\r\npages); Book XI. to the face and more particularly the jaws (55 pages);\r\nBook XII. to the neck and the rest of the spinal column (46 pages);\r\nBook XIII. to the shoulder and the structure of the spinal column in\r\ndetail (40 pages); Books XIV. and XV. to the genital organs and the\r\nparts in which the foetus develops (70 pages); Book XVI. to the nerves,\r\narteries and veins (43 pages); and Book XVII. Epilogue (11 pages).\r\n\r\nThere are very few modern text books in which the author treats the\r\nsubject in as exhaustive a manner as Galen has done in these seventeen\r\nbooks. As may readily be imagined from the great number and length\r\nof his writings, he often wanders off into side issues and thus lays\r\nhimself open to the charge of being a diffuse writer. At the same\r\ntime he cannot be accused of dullness, for in reading Daremberg’s\r\nversion one is seldom tempted to omit any of the text, and his style\r\nis interesting. The following brief extracts, to which should be added\r\nthat given on a previous page, may be taken as fair samples of his\r\nmanner of treating questions in the department of physiology:--\r\n\r\n   _Reasons why the Alae Nasi are Cartilaginous and why they may\r\n   be Moved by Voluntary Muscular Action._--We have already\r\n   explained in some measure the reasons why the alae nasi should\r\n   be composed of cartilage and why it should be possible for the\r\n   animal to move them at will.[41] It is an established fact that\r\n   the movements of these parts are competent to aid in no small\r\n   degree the somewhat forcible inspirations and expirations. This\r\n   is the reason why the alae are constructed in such a manner as\r\n   to be easily movable. They are made of cartilage because this\r\n   substance is hard to fracture or to tear apart. The placing\r\n   of these alar movements under the control of the will, and\r\n   not under that of some other bodily force (like the arterial\r\n   impulse, for example), is certainly an excellent arrangement;\r\n   and, if one does not appreciate this without any further\r\n   explanation, it must be because my previous reasonings about\r\n   such matters have fallen upon inattentive ears.\r\n\r\n   (Translated from Book XI., Chapter XVII., of Daremberg’s French\r\n   version of Galen’s works.)\r\n\r\nAnother brief extract may be given here. It forms a part of the chapter\r\nrelating to the action of the sigmoid valves of the pulmonary artery,\r\netc., and merits special attention because it furnishes additional\r\nevidence of the correctness of Daremberg’s statement that Galen was\r\nthe leader of the most advanced school of experimentation:--\r\n\r\n   The more strongly the thorax, in its exertion of a compressing\r\n   force, tends to drive the blood (out of the heart), the more\r\n   tightly do these membranes (the sigmoid valves) close the\r\n   opening. Invested in a circular manner from within outward,\r\n   extending throughout the entire circumference of the interior\r\n   of the vessel, these membranous valves are, each one of them,\r\n   so accurately patterned and so perfectly fitted that when they\r\n   are put upon the stretch by the column of blood, they constitute\r\n   a single large membrane which closes (watertight) the orifice.\r\n   Pushed back by the return flow of the blood, they fall back\r\n   against the inner surface of the vein, and permit an easy\r\n   passage of the blood through the amply dilated orifice (which\r\n   they, an instant before, closed so perfectly).\r\n\r\n   (Translated from Book VI., Chapter XI., of Daremberg’s French\r\n   version of the works of Galen.)\r\n\r\nIn his comments upon the account of the sigmoid valves which I have\r\njust quoted, Daremberg says that the description of these structures\r\ngiven by Erasistratus at least four hundred years earlier is admitted\r\nby Galen to be so correct that it would scarcely be possible to furnish\r\na better one.\r\n\r\n_Galen’s Remarks upon the Subject of Diagnosis._--In the treatise\r\nentitled “On the parts of the Body Affected” (Book II., Chapter X.)\r\nGalen gives the following advice with regard to the method which it is\r\ndesirable to adopt when one wishes to ascertain which part or organ is\r\naffected, what is the nature of the disease there located, and whether\r\nit is primary in its nature or secondary to some affection of earlier\r\ndevelopment:--\r\n\r\n   It should have been the special duty of Archigenes, who\r\n   appeared on the scene next in order after a series of the most\r\n   illustrious physicians,[42] to infuse more light into medical\r\n   teaching. Unfortunately, he did the very opposite; for we who\r\n   have grown old in the exercise of the art (and should therefore\r\n   find it easy to comprehend what is written about medicine), are\r\n   at times unable to understand what he says. Such being the true\r\n   state of affairs, I now propose to undertake what Archigenes\r\n   failed to accomplish. I shall commence by indicating in a\r\n   general way what is the proper method to adopt when one wishes\r\n   to ascertain in what part or organ the disease is located and\r\n   how one should proceed when it is proposed to teach the method\r\n   to others. This method may be stated in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n   In the first place, the part should be carefully examined in\r\n   order that we may ascertain whether it presents any signs of\r\n   special value as indicating the nature of the disease. In the\r\n   next place, it is important in such an examination to know\r\n   beforehand what are the particular signs which belong to each\r\n   of the diseases that may affect the part or organ in question,\r\n   and also whether these signs vary according to the particular\r\n   section of the organ involved. In inflammation of the lung,\r\n   for example, there are: difficulty in breathing (dyspnoea) and\r\n   great general distress (malaise), the patient being obliged to\r\n   remain in a sitting posture (orthopnoea)--all of which are signs\r\n   indicating the possibility of suffocation. Furthermore, the\r\n   air expired from the infected lung is sensibly hot, especially\r\n   if the inflammation is of the erysipelatous variety, and, as\r\n   a consequence, the patient shows a disposition to draw long\r\n   breaths, knowing that the cold air which he thus draws into\r\n   his lungs will afford him some measure of relief. The sputa\r\n   expectorated when he coughs are differently colored; some\r\n   being red, yellowish, or of a rusty appearance, while others\r\n   are almost black, livid, or frothy. The patient also often\r\n   experiences the sensation of a heavy weight in his chest,\r\n   together with more or less pain, which seems to be located\r\n   deep down in that region and which shoots backward into his\r\n   spinal column or forward toward the sternum. Add to these\r\n   manifestations a high fever and a pulse such as we have already\r\n   described on another page, and you will have....\r\n\r\n   (Translated from Daremberg’s French version of Galen’s works.)\r\n\r\nIt has been said that Galen possessed more than the ordinary share of\r\nvanity with regard to his cleverness as a diagnostician; and certainly\r\nsome of the accounts which he gives, in his clinical and scientific\r\ntreatises, of his own experiences, seem to bear out this accusation.\r\nOne hesitates to expose the weak spots in the character of one of the\r\nreally great men of antiquity lest such exposure may convey a wrong\r\nimpression; at the same time it would be an error to represent him as\r\na man entirely free from the foibles common to humanity,--even to the\r\nbest and wisest of men. I therefore repeat here Galen’s own account of\r\na professional visit which he made to a brother physician whose malady\r\npresented to himself and to his friends many obscure features.\r\n\r\n   Upon the occasion of my first visit to Rome I completely won the\r\n   admiration of the philosopher Glaucon by the diagnosis which I\r\n   made in the case of one of his friends. Meeting me one day in\r\n   the street he shook hands with me and said: “I have just come\r\n   from the house of a sick man, and I wish that you would visit\r\n   him with me. He is a Sicilian physician, the same person with\r\n   whom I was walking when you met me the other day.” “What is the\r\n   matter with him?” I asked. Then coming nearer to me he said,\r\n   in the frankest manner possible: “Gorgias and Apelas told me\r\n   yesterday that you had made some diagnoses and prognoses which\r\n   looked to them more like acts of divination than products of the\r\n   medical art pure and simple. I would therefore like very much to\r\n   see some proof, not of your knowledge but of this extraordinary\r\n   art which you are said to possess.” At this very moment we\r\n   reached the entrance of the patient’s house, and so, to my\r\n   regret, I was prevented from having any further conversation\r\n   with him on the subject and from explaining to him how the\r\n   element of good luck often renders it possible for a physician\r\n   to give, as it were off-hand, diagnoses and prognoses of this\r\n   exceptional character. Just as we were approaching the first\r\n   door, after entering the house, we met a servant who had in his\r\n   hand a basin which he had brought from the sick room and which\r\n   he was on his way to empty upon the dung heap. As we passed\r\n   him I appeared not to pay any attention to the contents of the\r\n   basin, but at a mere glance I perceived that they consisted of a\r\n   thin sanio-sanguinolent fluid, in which floated excrementitious\r\n   masses that resembled shreds of flesh--an unmistakable evidence\r\n   of disease of the liver. Glaucon and I, not a word having been\r\n   spoken by either of us, passed on into the patient’s room. When\r\n   I put out my hand to feel of the latter’s pulse, he called my\r\n   attention to the fact that he had just had a stool, and that,\r\n   owing to the circumstance of his having gotten out of bed, his\r\n   pulse might be accelerated. It was in fact somewhat more rapid\r\n   than it should be, but I attributed this to the existence of\r\n   an inflammation. Then, observing upon the window sill a vessel\r\n   containing a mixture of hyssop and honey and water, I made up\r\n   my mind that the patient, who was himself a physician, believed\r\n   that the malady from which he was suffering was a pleurisy; the\r\n   pain which he experienced on the right side in the region of\r\n   the false ribs (and which is also associated with inflammation\r\n   of the liver) confirming him in this belief, and thus inducing\r\n   him to order for the relief of the slight accompanying cough\r\n   the mixture to which I have just called attention. It was then\r\n   that the idea came into my mind that, as fortune had thrown the\r\n   opportunity in my way, I would avail myself of it to enhance\r\n   my reputation in Glaucon’s estimation. Accordingly, placing my\r\n   hand on the patient’s right side over the false rib, I remarked:\r\n   “This is the spot where the disease is located.” He, supposing\r\n   that I must have gained this knowledge by simply feeling his\r\n   pulse, replied with a look which plainly expressed admiration\r\n   mingled with astonishment, that I was entirely right. “And”--I\r\n   added simply to increase his astonishment--“you will doubtless\r\n   admit that at long intervals you feel impelled to indulge in\r\n   a shallow, dry cough, unaccompanied by any expectoration.” As\r\n   luck would have it, he coughed in just this manner almost before\r\n   I had got the words out of my mouth. At this Glaucon, who had\r\n   hitherto not spoken a word, broke out into a volley of praises.\r\n   “Do not imagine,” I replied, “that what you have observed\r\n   represents the utmost of which medical art is capable in the\r\n   matter of fathoming the mysteries of disease in a living person.\r\n   There still remain one or two other symptoms to which I will\r\n   direct your attention.” Turning then to the patient I remarked:\r\n   “When you draw a longer breath you feel a more marked pain, do\r\n   you not, in the region which I indicated; and with this pain\r\n   there is associated a sense of weight in the hypochondrium?”\r\n   At these words the patient expressed his astonishment and\r\n   admiration in the strongest possible terms. I wanted to go a\r\n   step farther and announce to my audience still another symptom\r\n   which is sometimes observed in the more serious maladies of the\r\n   liver (scirrhus, for example), but I was afraid that I might\r\n   compromise the laudation which had been bestowed upon me. It\r\n   then occurred to me that I might safely make the announcement\r\n   if I put it somewhat in the form of a prognosis. So I remarked\r\n   to the patient: “You will probably soon experience, if you have\r\n   not already done so, a sensation of something pulling upon the\r\n   right clavicle.” He admitted that he had already noticed this\r\n   symptom. “Then I will give just one more evidence of this power\r\n   of divination which you believe that I possess. You, yourself,\r\n   before I arrived on the scene, had made up your mind that your\r\n   ailment was an attack of pleurisy, etc.”\r\n\r\n   Glaucon’s confidence in me and in the medical art, after this\r\n   episode, was unbounded.\r\n\r\nThirty or forty years elapsed after Galen’s death before the Profession\r\nbegan to realize how great an authority he had become in all matters\r\nrelating to medicine; not perhaps among the majority of physicians, but\r\namong the better educated and those more given to reasoning about the\r\nvarious problems in physiology and pathology. Then came the invasion\r\nof Rome by the Barbarians, and with it the scattering of nearly all\r\nthose who were at the time practicing medicine in that great city.\r\nThis was the beginning of the long period known as the Middle Ages,\r\na period during which, so far as Italy and Gaul were concerned, the\r\nscience of medicine made no advance whatever. The physicians living\r\nin a precarious manner in the towns, and the monks who practiced\r\nmedicine in the country districts, took very little interest, as may\r\nreadily be imagined, in the achievements of Galen. Through all those\r\nyears they clung to the doctrines of the Methodists, as revealed to\r\nthem in the work of Caelius Aurelianus, the favorite medical treatise\r\nof that period. It was only during the latter part of the Middle Ages\r\nthat Galen’s teachings began once more to be appreciated at their true\r\nvalue; and, as time went on, they gained a stronger and stronger hold\r\non the minds of medical men, until finally they held undisputed sway.\r\nFriedlaender, speaking of medicine in those dark times, uses these\r\nwords: “Galen’s colossal personality loomed up throughout that long\r\nnight as a brilliant guiding star to light the intricate pathways of\r\nmedicine.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n     THE INFLUENCE OF CHRISTIANITY UPON THE EVOLUTION OF MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religion established by Jesus Christ in Judea during the early part\r\nof the first century remained confined within the limits of that region\r\nfor a number of years, but already during the latter half of that\r\nperiod groups of Christians were to be found in every part of the Roman\r\nEmpire, and in certain localities the membership of the new church had\r\nincreased so greatly in numbers as to excite the alarm and hostility\r\nof the temple priests and of the governing officials. Persecutions,\r\nespecially in the city of Rome and at the instigation of Nero, became\r\nmore and more frequent and more and more pitiless, but they failed\r\nutterly to destroy the new religion, so firmly was it rooted in the\r\nfollowers of Jesus Christ. As a matter of fact its spread was checked\r\nfor only a few years, and then its adherents increased in numbers more\r\nrapidly than ever. Neuburger, in his “History of Medicine,” makes the\r\nfollowing quotation from the account which Dionysius of Alexandria\r\ngives of the great plague that occurred during the third century A. D.:\r\n\r\n   The majority of our brethren in their love for their neighbors\r\n   did not spare themselves, but acted as a unit in their efforts\r\n   to assist. They visited the sick without the slightest fear and\r\n   gave them the very best of care, for the sake of Christ....\r\n   Among the non-Christians, however, the very opposite was true.\r\n   As soon as any of their number fell ill they pushed them to one\r\n   side, even those who were dearest to them, and, before they were\r\n   more than half-dead, they threw them out into the street and\r\n   took no care to bury the dead bodies.\r\n\r\nSuch an example of self-sacrifice and humanity--and there must have\r\nbeen very many similar examples--could not possibly have failed to make\r\na profound impression upon the community at large. Daniel Le Clerc says\r\nthat three physicians suffered martyrdom for their Christian faith\r\nduring the reigns of the Emperors Marcus Aurelius, Lucius Verus and\r\nCommodus. They were Papila (of Pergamum), Alexander (of Lyons) and\r\nSanctus (a contemporary of Galen), whose death was of a particularly\r\ncruel character. Credit should also be given to Christianity, says\r\nthe same writer, for having established the rule that every community\r\nshould assume the expense and responsibility of caring for its own\r\npoor and sick. This was a step of the greatest importance; and, at\r\na still later period, when Christianity became largely an affair of\r\nthe state, a complete hospital organization was effected, with the\r\nbishop as the chief officer and, under him, deacons and deaconesses.\r\nSuch well-organized institutions proved to be of the greatest possible\r\nbenefit to the advance of medical science. They were the worthy\r\nsuccessors of those more ancient hospitals, the Aesculapian temples,\r\nwhich were first established by the Greeks in the pre-Hippocratic age,\r\nand they have continued in an unbroken chain from the institutions of\r\nthose primitive times to the thoroughly well-equipped hospitals of the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nIn 330 A. D. the new capital of the Roman Empire was established\r\nin Byzantium, afterward called Constantinople, and Rome, which for\r\nhundreds of years had been the metropolis of the world and the source\r\nfrom which a large part of Roman history had emanated, was given a\r\nsubordinate position. Then followed, in 410 A. D., the conquest of the\r\nlatter city by the Visigoths, a horde of uneducated Barbarians who had\r\nfelt the might of Rome in previous years, and who now doubtless took\r\nimmense satisfaction in humiliating her and in destroying her valuable\r\npossessions. There are good reasons for believing that, when the\r\nEmperor Constantine established his residence in Byzantium, the leading\r\nphysicians of Rome followed him; and it is not likely that many of\r\nthose who, for one reason or another, preferred to remain in the old\r\ncapital, continued to do so after it became known that the Barbarians\r\nwere approaching the city. But the migration of these physicians to the\r\nnew capital did not mean a renewal there of the scientific activity\r\nwhich had characterized the growth of Greek medicine in Rome during\r\nthe first two centuries of the Christian Era. It is probable that\r\nthe fugitives, being obliged to travel with the smallest amount of\r\nbaggage possible, left the major part of their books and papyrus rolls\r\nbehind, hoping, no doubt, that they might be able at some later date\r\nto recover them. But the favorable occasion never arrived, and thus a\r\ngreat deal of valuable medical literature entirely disappeared. The\r\nloss, however, might have been even more serious than it was if the\r\nChristian church had not already (during the third century) begun to\r\nestablish monasteries in secluded and inaccessible spots. It was to\r\nthese institutions that not only books of a religious character, but\r\nalso those relating to the science of medicine, were transported for\r\nsafe keeping during the early Middle Ages. Farther on, I shall have\r\noccasion to refer to this subject again and to discuss more fully\r\ncertain other benefits which accrued to medical science from these\r\nmonastic institutions.\r\n\r\nBut while, on the one hand, the Christian church through the\r\ninstrumentality of the monasteries was lending its aid to the\r\npreservation of the sources of medical knowledge, it was, on the other,\r\ndoing its best to arrest all further evolution of that branch of\r\nscience; not consciously, it must be admitted, but through a mistaken\r\nsense of its duty to God. Thus it came about that the Emperor Justinian\r\nI. (527–567 A. D.), acting under the narrow-minded advice of his\r\necclesiastical counsellors, closed the medical schools at Athens and\r\nAlexandria and at the same time withdrew the regular allowance of money\r\nwhich up to that time had been paid to the state physicians and to\r\nspecial scholars. A few years later, however (_i.e._, in the early\r\npart of the seventh century A. D.), some of the more highly educated\r\nphysicians of Alexandria got together and made the attempt to organize\r\na school of medicine in that city. A course of lectures was planned\r\nand sixteen of Galen’s works, carefully chosen for the purpose, were\r\nmade the basis of the new course of instruction. The books selected\r\nwere first carefully edited and simplified, and then commentaries\r\nwere added in order that in their final shape these treatises might\r\nbe better suited to the uses of students. The invasion of Alexandria\r\nby the Arabs, however, soon put an effectual stop to this promising\r\nattempt to revive Greek medicine.\r\n\r\nIn this brief sketch I have thus far mentioned only the more direct\r\neffects produced by the new religion upon the evolution of medicine.\r\nThe indirect effects, however, were also in some cases of very great\r\nimportance. At the beginning of her history there developed in the\r\nChristian church, among her chief men, a strong disposition to quarrel\r\nover dogmas. To apply the term quarrelsomeness to this tendency may\r\neasily convey a wrong impression. It was, more strictly speaking, a\r\nhighly developed conscientiousness on the part of men whose minds were\r\ndeeply imbued with the idea that they were rendering God a service by\r\nkeeping what they believed to be the true and only religion free from\r\nerrors of all kinds. It took many centuries to impress the leaders\r\nof the church with the fact that the religion of Jesus Christ, like\r\nthe science of medicine or the natural sciences, was capable of\r\ndevelopment to an almost indefinite extent; and it is owing to our\r\nappreciation of this important fact that we moderns look with so much\r\nmore lenient eyes upon the distressing, not to say cruel, events\r\nof mediaeval ecclesiastical history. At the time of which I am now\r\nwriting, however, it was considered highly unchristian--especially\r\nfor one holding authority in the church--to believe otherwise than\r\nas her doctrines taught; and accordingly, in the early part of the\r\nfifth century A. D., Nestorius, the Patriarch of Constantinople, was\r\ndeposed from his high office by a Council of the church and imprisoned\r\nbecause he was unwilling to teach the doctrine of the miraculous birth\r\nof Jesus Christ. Those who accepted the view held by Nestorius--and\r\nthey eventually became a very numerous and a very influential body of\r\nChristians--were driven out of Constantinople and compelled to seek\r\nhomes in distant places. This affords, perhaps, an explanation of the\r\nfact that, during the eighth century A. D., many Nestorian Christians\r\nwere found living in the eastern part of Syria and in Persia; and it\r\nseems fair to assume that these Christian communities represented\r\nto some extent the direct successors of those Nestorians who had\r\ntaken refuge in this remote corner of Asia Minor three hundred years\r\nearlier. Furthermore, it is highly probable that there were Christian\r\ncommunities in this region several centuries before the Nestorians\r\narrived, for it is believed that the Apostles James and Thomas visited\r\nPersia and the northeastern part of Syria in the course of their work\r\nas evangelists. It is not known, though, how many of the descendants of\r\nthese earlier Christians adopted the peculiar beliefs of the Nestorian\r\nrefugees.\r\n\r\nAnd here it should be stated that the facts which have thus far\r\nbeen mentioned are not the only ones that throw some light upon the\r\nrelationship subsisting between Christianity and the spread of medical\r\nknowledge to Western Europe. Those which remain to be considered\r\nare of two kinds, viz., facts relating to the origin of the Arabic\r\nRenaissance, and facts which show that the Christian church, from the\r\nfourth century onward, was contributing not a little, through the\r\nestablishment of the great monastic orders, such as the Benedictines,\r\nthe Dominicans, and the Franciscans, to the preservation if not to the\r\nfurther evolution of Graeco-Roman medical knowledge. I shall reserve\r\nfor consideration in a later chapter this particular part of the\r\nhistory of medicine; and in the meantime I shall endeavor to describe\r\nthe events which preceded and rendered possible the active study of\r\nGreek medicine on the part of the followers of Mohammed.\r\n\r\nSo far as history furnishes us with any information on the subject, the\r\nNestorians who lived in Persia, Syria and Mesopotamia were Christians\r\nof a remarkably liberal type. They appear to have been an unusually\r\npeaceable people, for not only were they kindly disposed toward one\r\nanother, but they seem to have been on the best of terms with their\r\nJewish neighbors, who, like themselves, were eager after knowledge.\r\nAlready at a very early period there existed at Djondisabour--a\r\ntown which had been founded in the Province of Khorassan, in the\r\nnortheastern part of Persia, about the year 260 A. D., by Sapor II.,\r\nKing of that country--a school in which the medicine of Hippocrates\r\nwas taught. Freind, in his “History of Physick” (London, 1727),\r\nsays that about the year 272 A. D. the Emperor Aurelian (Lucius\r\nDomitius Aurelianus), as a compliment to his daughter, who was the\r\nwife of the King of Persia, sent to Djondisabour, the city in which\r\nshe resided, several Greek physicians; and Abulpharagius, the Arab\r\nhistorian (thirteenth century), intimates that these were the men\r\nwho conducted the teaching in the newly established medical school.\r\nAnother possibility suggests itself. After the death of Alexander the\r\nGreat in Babylon (323 B. C.), from malarial fever, it is not unlikely\r\nthat some of the numerous Greek physicians who accompanied the army in\r\nan official character, and who, we are warranted in believing, were\r\nexceptionally well educated, decided not to remain in that unhealthy\r\ndistrict, but to settle in some of the neighboring towns (_e.g._,\r\nNisibis in the hill country to the north of Babylon, or Sura to the\r\neast of the river Tigris); and that these men also contributed their\r\nshare toward the planting and perpetuation of Greek medicine in this\r\ndistrict of the Orient. However, the salient fact in this period of\r\nthe history of medicine is this: When Almansur, the Caliph of Bagdad\r\n(712 to 775 A. D.), made up his mind to introduce Greek medicine into\r\nhis kingdom and looked around for the ways and means of accomplishing\r\nthis, he found at the city of Djondisabour men who were not only well\r\nversed in Greek medicine, but who at the same time were so thoroughly\r\ngrounded in all departments of scholarship that they could at once\r\nbegin the work of translating the writings of Hippocrates and other\r\nclassical medical authors into Arabic, the language of the Mohammedans.\r\nBut at this stage of affairs the existence of a serious obstacle was\r\ndiscovered. The writings which it was proposed to translate were not\r\nimmediately obtainable, and it therefore became necessary to institute\r\nwithout delay a vigorous search for the books required. In order that\r\nthe reader may appreciate fully the difficulties which Almansur had to\r\novercome, in this matter of a scarcity of Greek originals, it seems\r\nbest to pause at this point, and to review briefly some of the facts\r\nwhich bear upon the question at issue.\r\n\r\n_The Wholesale Destruction of Medical Literature during the Early\r\nCenturies of the Christian Era._--The invasion of Rome in 410 A. D.\r\nwas one of the first events which entailed a serious loss of the Greek\r\nmedical books that had been accumulating for several centuries in that\r\ncity. Fortunately, not a few of these works were rescued in time by\r\nthe church authorities and deposited for safe keeping in the various\r\nmonasteries scattered all over the Roman Empire. A still more serious\r\ndestruction of books occurred about the year 638 A. D., when Amrou, a\r\nfamous Arabian warrior, captured Alexandria and--under the instructions\r\nof his master, Omar ben Khattab--destroyed the greater part of the\r\ncontents of the famous libraries located in that city. The narrative of\r\nthis event, as told by Lucien Le Clerc, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n   John the Grammarian,[43] who was living at that time in\r\n   Alexandria, held the following conversation with Amrou on a\r\n   certain occasion: “You have inspected all the edifices of\r\n   Alexandria, and have sequestrated all their contents. I have no\r\n   objections to your appropriating everything that may be of use\r\n   to you; there are certain things, however, which you may not\r\n   wish to possess, but which are highly prized by us.”\r\n\r\n   “What are those objects?” inquired Amrou.\r\n\r\n   “The works on philosophy, which are contained in the public\r\n   libraries,” John replied.\r\n\r\n   “I can do nothing about them without a special order from the\r\n   Prince of Believers, Omar ben Khattab,” was the answer given by\r\n   Amrou.\r\n\r\n   John’s wish having in the meantime been conveyed by the General\r\n   to Omar, the latter sent this reply:--\r\n\r\n   “As to the books of which you speak, I have this to say. If\r\n   their contents agree with what is written in the word of God,\r\n   the books are of no use to us, the Holy Writ being sufficient\r\n   for our guidance. But if they are at variance with God’s word,\r\n   then surely they should be destroyed.”\r\n\r\n   Amrou therefore ordered all the books to be sent to the bathing\r\n   establishments of Alexandria, to be used as fuel in heating\r\n   the baths. So great was the number of books contained in the\r\n   libraries that it took six months to consume them all. (Sismondi\r\n   questions the correctness of this account.)\r\n\r\nWhile the invasion of Rome by the Barbarians in the fifth century\r\nand the capture of Alexandria by the Arabs in the early part of the\r\nseventh gave rise to an enormous loss of valuable books relating to\r\nmedicine and philosophy in general, these were by no means the only\r\noccasions when books were probably destroyed in great quantities. Wars\r\nwere frequent in those days and towns were constantly being sacked.\r\nEverywhere throughout the East the modern traveler encounters the ruins\r\nof large cities, and in those cities--the centres, as they were, of\r\nwealth and culture--there must have been large collections of books. It\r\nis not at all strange, therefore, that when the Caliph Almansur made\r\na serious beginning of the work which was to convert the Arabs into\r\nrivals of the ancient Greeks, he should have found a great scarcity of\r\nmedical works which, after being translated, were to serve as manuals\r\nof instruction. However, his ambition was very great, his wealth almost\r\ninexhaustible, and his associates eager to aid him in realizing the\r\n_renaissance_ which he had planned for his people; and, as will\r\nappear later on, he and those who aided him eventually succeeded in\r\novercoming this apparently insurmountable obstacle.\r\n\r\nAmong the medical books which, upon the approach of the Goths,\r\nwere carried from Rome and other cities to different monasteries\r\nfor safe keeping there must have been very few that were written\r\nin Latin, and yet these were the only ones from which the monks\r\nindividually could derive any benefit. Several centuries later, when\r\nall the monasteries of Italy and the East were visited by those who\r\nwere searching eagerly for original manuscript copies of the Greek\r\nmedical writers,--Hippocrates, Soranus, Rufus of Ephesus, Aretaeus,\r\nDioscorides, Galen,--it was found that such copies existed in a number\r\nof these institutions, thus showing that the monks had been actuated by\r\nunselfish and far-seeing loyalty to the best interests of mankind when\r\nthey rescued these particular treasures from the hands of the enemy.\r\nThey themselves could make no use of them, being unable to read Greek,\r\nbut they knew their priceless value to medical science.\r\n\r\nThe Latin treatises which they had also rescued, and of which they made\r\nexcellent use during the succeeding centuries, were those of Celsus,\r\nScribonius Largus, Pliny the Elder (to a slight degree only) and\r\nCaelius Aurelianus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PART II\r\n\r\n                          MEDIAEVAL MEDICINE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n           THE CONDITION OF MEDICINE AT BYZANTIUM DURING THE\r\n                     EARLY PART OF THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Byzantine period of the history of medicine begins about the middle\r\nof the fourth century A. D. and retains some degree of importance up to\r\nor perhaps a little beyond the beginning of the eighth century. During\r\nthis period of nearly four centuries there appeared on the scene five\r\nphysicians whose writings form a very creditable part of the late Greek\r\nmedical literature. The names of these authors are: Oribasius, Aëtius,\r\nAlexander of Tralles, Theodore Priscianus and Paulus Aegineta.\r\n\r\n_Oribasius._--The first physician named in this list, Oribasius,\r\nwas born about the year 325 A. D. in Pergamum, an important city\r\nof Asia Minor and the birthplace of Galen. He received his medical\r\ntraining at Alexandria, settled in Constantinople (the new name given\r\nto Byzantium), and soon afterward became the personal physician of\r\nthe Emperor Julian the Apostate, the nephew of Constantine the Great.\r\nSubsequently he was appointed Quaestor of Constantinople, but, upon\r\nthe death of Julian (363 A. D.) and the accession of Valens and\r\nValentinianus to power, his property was confiscated and he himself was\r\nobliged to take refuge among the Ostrogoths, who dwelt on the shores of\r\nthe Black Sea. These people received him with open arms, and he soon\r\nacquired great influence among them. After a time, however, he was\r\nrecalled to Constantinople and all his former privileges were once more\r\ngranted to him. He died about the year 403 A. D.\r\n\r\nDespite his duties as a practicing physician of the very highest\r\nrank--duties which he could not wholly set aside when he accepted the\r\noffice of Quaestor of Constantinople--and despite the necessity of\r\ndevoting considerable time to the work which this non-medical official\r\nposition entailed, Oribasius, like Pliny, appears to have been a most\r\nenergetic contributor to medical literature. We possess to-day, for\r\nexample, a large part of the medical cyclopaedia (72 books) which he\r\nprepared at the command of the Emperor Julian, and which--even in its\r\nincomplete state--contains very full information regarding anatomy,\r\nphysiology, surgery, pathology and pharmacology. Although the work\r\nis simply a compilation, its present value is great, for it contains\r\nnumerous extracts from earlier and contemporary treatises, many of\r\nwhich have entirely disappeared,--treatises of which we should have had\r\nno knowledge whatever if Oribasius had not introduced numerous extracts\r\nfrom them into his cyclopaedia.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 390 A. D., when Oribasius was already an old man, he\r\npublished (in nine books) a “Synopsis” of the larger work, chiefly\r\nfor the benefit of his son Eustathios, who was at that time studying\r\nmedicine. Surgery is omitted from this work, as that branch of medicine\r\nwas assumed to belong entirely to specialists. At a still later date\r\n(about 395 A. D.), Oribasius published a third work (in four books)\r\nentitled “Euporista,” which was intended chiefly for the use of\r\nlaymen. The subject-matter of this treatise consists of diet, hygiene\r\nand general therapeutics. Neuburger speaks well of all three of the\r\npublished works of Oribasius, and furnishes a fairly full analysis of\r\nthe contents of each one.\r\n\r\nBussemaker and Daremberg have published, in six volumes (Paris,\r\n1856–1876), an excellent French version of the works of Oribasius.\r\n\r\n_Priscianus._--Theodorus Priscianus lived during the latter part\r\nof the fourth and the first part of the fifth century of the present\r\nera. Very little is known about his professional career beyond the\r\nfacts that he was a pupil of Vindicianus, a distinguished physician\r\nwho lived during the reign of the Emperor Valentinianus I. at\r\nConstantinople (364–375 A. D.), and that subsequently he was chosen\r\nthe private physician of the Emperor Gratianus (375–383 A. D.). The\r\ntreatise which he composed, and which bore the title of “Euporiston,”\r\nwas originally written in Greek, but was afterward translated by\r\nits author into Latin. An excellent German version of the work by\r\nMeyer-Steineg was published in Jena in 1909. As the book was intended\r\nby Priscianus to serve chiefly as a guide to practitioners of the\r\nart, it contains practically nothing about anatomy and physiology.\r\nIn his pathology he follows closely the teachings of the Methodists;\r\nhis first question, in the presence of a case of illness, being: “Do\r\nthe symptoms point to a condition of _strictum_ rather than to\r\none of _laxum_, or _vice versa_?” “In his treatment,” says\r\nMeyer-Steineg, “Priscianus follows very closely the rule that every\r\npatient, no matter what may be the disease with which he is affected,\r\nshould first undergo a certain amount of general treatment.” In his\r\nchoice of remedies Priscianus invariably gives the preference to those\r\nagents which are of a simple character and easy to obtain. On the other\r\nhand, he does not hesitate to admit that he sometimes employs certain\r\nmagical remedies, as is shown by the following quotation taken from\r\nBook IV., Chapter I., section 4:--\r\n\r\n   If a person wears, during the waning of the moon, a wreath\r\n   of polygonum on his head, he will obtain relief from his\r\n   headache.... If one drinks of the water from which an ox has\r\n   just drank, he will be relieved of the pain in his head.... If\r\n   a loadstone be held upon the head it will draw out the hidden\r\n   pain, and the same effect may be obtained by rubbing over the\r\n   forehead a swallow’s nest thoroughly mixed with vinegar.\r\n\r\nIn Book I, paragraph 2, Priscianus draws a picture of the rude\r\nand uncivilized behavior of the practitioners of his day in the\r\nsick-room. The following are his words as translated from the German of\r\nMeyer-Steineg:--\r\n\r\n   As the patient lies on his bed prostrated by the severity of\r\n   the disease, there quickly comes into the room a crowd of us\r\n   physicians. No feeling of sympathy for the sick man have we,\r\n   nor do we realize how impotent we all are in the presence of\r\n   these forces of nature. Instead, we struggle to the utmost of\r\n   our ability to obtain charge of the case; one depending for\r\n   success on his powers of persuasion, a second on the strength\r\n   of the arguments which he is able to bring forward, a third on\r\n   his readiness to agree with everything that is said, and the\r\n   fourth on his skill in contradicting the opinion of everybody\r\n   else. And, as this quarrel goes on, the patient continues to lie\r\n   there in a state of exhaustion. “For shame!” Nature seems to\r\n   say, “you men are an ungrateful lot! You do not even permit the\r\n   patient to die quietly; you simply kill him. And then, moreover,\r\n   you accuse me of not furnishing sufficient means of effecting a\r\n   cure. Illness is certainly a painful affair, but I have provided\r\n   plenty of remedies. Poisons, I admit, are hidden in some of the\r\n   plants, but the healing agents which may be extracted from them\r\n   are much more numerous. Away, then, with your angry disputes and\r\n   your self-glorifying chatter; for in these are not to be found\r\n   the remedial agents which I have bestowed upon man, but rather\r\n   in the powerful forces which reside in the seeds, fruits, plants\r\n   and other objects which I have created in his interests.”\r\n\r\n_Aëtius._--Aëtius was a native of Amida, in Mesopotamia, and\r\nhe lived during the early part of the sixth century A. D., under\r\nthe Emperor Justinian I. He studied medicine at Alexandria and then\r\nsettled in Constantinople, where he was appointed to the double office\r\nof private physician to the emperor and commanding officer of his\r\nbody-guard (_Comes obsequii_),--an arrangement which made it\r\npracticable for the emperor to have his physician near his person on\r\nall possible occasions. Almost nothing is known about the subsequent\r\nprivate life and professional career of Aëtius beyond the facts that\r\nhe was a Christian and that he wrote a treatise on medicine in sixteen\r\nbooks, which together form a large volume. The work, says Le Clerc, is\r\nalmost entirely a compilation from the treatises of earlier writers\r\non medicine and surgery; the best parts of the book being those which\r\nrelate to the pathology and treatment of internal diseases, to materia\r\nmedica, and to ophthalmology. The Christianity of Aëtius, like that of\r\nAlexander of Tralles, and other physicians of a later period, appears\r\nto have permitted a belief in magical remedies. For example, Aëtius\r\ngives formulae containing the names of the Saviour and the Holy Martyrs\r\nfor exorcising certain maladies, and he recommends the employment of\r\namulets. The subject of baths is treated by him quite thoroughly, and\r\nhe lays stress upon the importance of physical exercise as a means of\r\nmaintaining one’s health. Freind, the author of an English history of\r\nmedicine which was very popular in its day,[44] quotes the following\r\nremedy for gout from the treatise of Aëtius:--\r\n\r\n    In September to drink milk;\r\n    in October to eat garlick;\r\n    in November to abstain from bathing;\r\n    in December not to eat cabbage;\r\n    in January to take a glass of pure wine in the morning;\r\n    in February to eat no beet;\r\n    in March to mix sweet things both in eatables and drinkables;\r\n    in April not to eat horseradish;\r\n    nor in May the fish called Polypus;\r\n    in June to drink cold water;--and so on through the remainder of\r\n      the year.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the French version of “_Les Oeuvres de Rufus\r\nd’Éphèse_” (translated from the Greek by Daremberg and Ruelle)\r\nwill be found fragments of some of the books of Aëtius; in 1899 J.\r\nHirschberg translated into German Book VII. (eye diseases) of the\r\nsame author; and, two years later (1901) Max Wegscheider published a\r\nGerman version of Book XVI. (obstetrics and gynaecology). No other\r\ntranslations of the writings of Aëtius into either French, German or\r\nEnglish are--so far as I am able to learn--available.\r\n\r\n_Alexander of Tralles._--Alexander of Tralles, a city of Lydia,\r\nin Asia Minor, was born about 525 A. D. His father Stephanus was\r\nhighly esteemed as a practicing physician, and his four brothers,\r\nall of them older than himself, were men of distinction in their\r\nseveral callings; Anthemius, the oldest, being one of the greatest\r\nmathematicians and mechanicians of his day and the man to whom the\r\nEmperor Justinian intrusted the rebuilding of the church of St.\r\nSophia in Constantinople;[45] Metrodorus, a celebrated grammarian and\r\nthe honored teacher of the youth belonging to the highest circles\r\nof that metropolis; Olympius, a leading authority in jurisprudence;\r\nand Dioscorus, a prominent physician in his native city. Alexander\r\nreceived his first instruction in medicine from his father, but he\r\nobtained his real training from a physician who was the father of his\r\nmost intimate friend Cosmas, and who, throughout Alexander’s entire\r\nsubsequent career, proved most helpful in advancing his interests. At\r\nfirst he traveled extensively, visiting in succession--probably in\r\nthe capacity of a military surgeon--Italy, Northern Africa, Gaul and\r\nSpain. Afterward, he settled permanently at Rome and practiced medicine\r\nthere during the remainder of a long life. Puschmann, the translator\r\nof his writings, seems disposed to believe that he was both a teacher\r\nand a practitioner of medicine during his residence in that city. When\r\nhe became too old to bear the heavy burdens of medical practice, he\r\nwrote an account of his life,--a life which was rich in professional\r\nexperience,--and thus built for himself “a monument more striking and\r\nmore durable than the splendid temple erected by his eldest brother.”\r\n(Meyer, quoted by Puschmann.)\r\n\r\nVarious circumstances justify the conclusion that Alexander of Tralles\r\nwas a Christian. His style of writing is simple and direct, and he\r\nstates his views with a degree of modesty which wins for him at once\r\nthe sympathy and confidence of his readers. He gives full and generous\r\nrecognition to the great physicians who lived and wrote before his\r\ntime, and more especially to Hippocrates. On the other hand, he does\r\nnot hesitate, when he believes that he is right, to put forward views\r\nwhich are in direct antagonism with those of even so great an authority\r\nas Galen. In the domain of therapeutics, says Puschmann, Alexander was\r\ndecidedly superior to Galen. His teachings are based on experience\r\ngained in actual practice, whereas Galen was very often disposed to\r\ntrust to considerations of a theoretical nature; for he was chiefly\r\ninterested in establishing the pathology of the different diseases and\r\nin opening up new territories in medicine in which the human mind might\r\ndisplay its activity.\r\n\r\nThe twelve books of which the treatise of Alexander of Tralles\r\nconsists, were printed in the original Greek for the first time in\r\n1548, by Robert Étienne, the celebrated printer of Francis I., King of\r\nFrance. The last and most perfect edition of the Greek text is that\r\nof the late Dr. Theodore Puschmann, which was published in Vienna\r\nin 1878 (two Vols.). It contains, in addition to the Greek version,\r\na careful analysis of the twelve individual books, and an admirable\r\nGerman translation of the entire work. It is from the latter that the\r\nfollowing brief extracts (translated into English) are taken:--\r\n\r\n   _Introduction to the writings of Alexander of\r\n   Tralles._--Upon a certain occasion, my dearest Cosmas, thou\r\n   didst urge me to publish my rich experiences in the domain of\r\n   practical medicine, and I am now gladly complying with thy wish,\r\n   for I feel under deep obligations to both thyself and thy father\r\n   for the kindness which you have shown to me on every possible\r\n   occasion in the past. Thy father was always a most helpful\r\n   patron to me, not only in my practice, but also in all other\r\n   relations of life. And thou also, even when thou wert living\r\n   abroad, stood staunchly by me through all the trials which I\r\n   experienced and the severe blows dealt me by Fate. For these\r\n   reasons I will now in my old age, when it is no longer possible\r\n   for me to endure the labor and worries of practice, do as thou\r\n   desirest, and will write a book in which shall be set forth the\r\n   experience which I have gained during my long service in the\r\n   treatment of disease. I hope that many of those who read what\r\n   is here written, with minds free from jealousy, will experience\r\n   real pleasure in noting the well-founded and scientific\r\n   character of the rules which I have laid down and the brevity\r\n   and preciseness of my descriptions. For I have done my very best\r\n   always to employ simple words, in order that everybody may find\r\n   it easy to understand my book.\r\n\r\n   _Some Magical Remedies or Amulets Recommended by Alexander\r\n   of Tralles, as Effective in the Treatment of Colic._--The\r\n   Thracians remove the heart from a lark while the bird is still\r\n   alive, and wear it, prepared as an amulet, on the left thigh.\r\n\r\n   Procure a little of the dung of a wolf, preferably some which\r\n   contains small bits of bone, and pack it in a tube which the\r\n   patient may easily wear as an amulet on his right arm, thigh, or\r\n   hip during the attack. He must be very careful, however, not to\r\n   allow the parts around the seat of the pain to come in contact\r\n   with the earth or with the water of a bath. This amulet is, in\r\n   my experience, an unfailing remedy, and almost all physicians of\r\n   any celebrity have commended its virtues.\r\n\r\n   Remove the nipple-like projection from the caecum of a young\r\n   pig, mix myrrh with it, wrap it in the skin of a wolf or dog,\r\n   and instruct the patient to wear it as an amulet during the\r\n   waning of the moon. Striking effects may be looked for from this\r\n   remedy.\r\n\r\n   Let the design of Hercules throttling a lion be engraved upon a\r\n   Median stone, and then instruct the patient to wear it on his\r\n   finger after it has been properly set in a ring of gold.\r\n\r\n   Take an iron ring and have the hoop made eight-sided. Then\r\n   engrave upon the eighth side these words: “Flee, flee, oh\r\n   Gaul! the lark has sought thee out.” On the under surface of\r\n   the head or seal of the ring engrave the letters J. C., thus:\r\n   [illustration] I have often made use of this amulet; and, while\r\n   I should consider it wrong to keep silence about a remedial\r\n   agent of such extraordinary efficacy in cases of colic, I\r\n   feel bound to say that it should not be recommended to the\r\n   first comer, but only to believers and to those individuals\r\n   who know how to guard it carefully. The Great Hippocrates,\r\n   with remarkable insight, gave the advice that things which are\r\n   holy should be intrusted only to those who are of a religious\r\n   character, and should be withheld from the profane. As regards\r\n   the ring, however, the patient must be careful, before wearing\r\n   it, to have a sketch made of it on either the seventeenth or the\r\n   twenty-first day of the moon.\r\n\r\nAlexander has been severely criticised for his advocacy of the\r\nemployment of amulets in the treatment of diseases; but he defends\r\nhimself against such criticism by saying that physicians owe it as a\r\nduty to their patients to study carefully what he calls the hidden\r\nforces of nature, and to pay unprejudiced attention to the effects\r\nproduced by amulets and other magical remedies. He reminds his critics\r\nthat Galen and other eminent medical authorities have insisted that\r\na place be given to this class of agents in the list of authorized\r\nremedies; and he adds that Galen further emphasizes the duty of the\r\nphysician to employ them when other measures fail, or when the patients\r\nthemselves frankly confess that they have faith in their efficacy and\r\ntherefore wish them to be tried. Alexander also makes the statement\r\nthat Galen, after treating for a long time all reports about the\r\nbeneficial results obtained from the employment of magical measures\r\nas old women’s tales, had finally decided that these benefits were at\r\ntimes marvelous and should be accepted as genuine by physicians even if\r\nthey are unable to explain them.\r\n\r\nHow much Alexander of Tralles really believed in these supernatural\r\nagents, or to what extent he relied upon their effect in influencing\r\nthe imagination, we may not know; but his was an age of superstition,\r\nand the conditions governing society at that time were very different\r\nfrom those which control the world at the present day.\r\n\r\n_Paulus Aegineta._--Paulus Aegineta[46] was born in the Island of\r\nAegina, not far from Athens, in the early part of the seventh century\r\nA. D., and practiced medicine in Alexandria, Egypt. He is known to us\r\nas the author of a compend of medicine which was very popular during\r\na long period of time, especially among the Arabs, who, as early as\r\ntwo hundred years after his death, translated his work from the Greek\r\ninto their own language. At a still later period it was also translated\r\ninto Latin, the two best versions in this language which we now possess\r\nbeing those of Guintherus Andernacus (Paris, 1532) and of J. Cornarius\r\n(Basel, 1556). There is also an English translation by F. Adams (“The\r\nSeven Books of Paulus Aegineta,” London, 1845–1847), which is favorably\r\nspoken of by Neuburger, and which is apparently at the present time\r\nthe only existing version of the work of Paulus of Aegina in a modern\r\nEuropean language; for the French translation by René Briau (“_La\r\nChirurgie de Paul d’Égine_,” Paris, 1855) comprises only Book VI.\r\n\r\nThe contents of the entire work are as follows: _Book\r\nI._--Dietetics of Pregnant Women and of Children; Children’s\r\nDiseases; Massage, Gymnastics, Sexual Hygiene, Bathing, etc.; _Book\r\nII._--General Pathology, the Doctrine of Fevers, Semeiology; _Book\r\nIII._--Diseases of the Hair, Diseases of the Brain and Nerves,\r\nDiseases of the Eyes, Ears, Nose, Mouth, Teeth and Face; _Book\r\nIV._--Leprosy, Skin Diseases, Inflammations, Swellings, Tumors,\r\nWounds, Ulcers, Fistulae, Hemorrhage, Worms, Affections of the Joints,\r\netc.; _Book V._--Toxicology; _Book VI._--Surgery; _Book\r\nVII._--Materia Medica.\r\n\r\nTo furnish even a very superficial analysis of the contents of this\r\ntreatise would call for more space than can well be given up here\r\nto such a purpose. I shall therefore simply mention a few points of\r\nspecial interest to which Neuburger calls attention in the course\r\nof his very full analysis of the work. He states, for example, that\r\nPaulus mentions several instances in which patients affected with lung\r\ndisease, coughed up calculi or small stone-like masses. He also states\r\nthat the same author was familiar with the fact that in the course of\r\n“phthisis,” the pus may find its way into the bladder and there cause\r\nulceration [in other words, that pus containing tubercle baccilli\r\nmay flow down by way of the ureters and cause tuberculous ulceration\r\nof the bladder]. Paulus’ theory regarding the origin of gout, adds\r\nNeuburger, is quite remarkable for that early period. He maintains, for\r\nexample, that in persons who lead a rather inactive life and who are\r\noften affected with digestive disorders, there is produced, through the\r\ninadequate power of the tissues of the body to assimilate the excess\r\nof nutriment brought to them, a _materies morbi_ which is drawn\r\nfirst to the parts that are weakest or least capable of resistance (the\r\njoints, for example) and then also to other structures, as the liver,\r\nspleen, throat, ears and teeth. These ideas--let it be remembered--were\r\nset down in writing in 650 A. D.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of his analysis of Book VI., Neuburger makes this\r\nremark: “Although the description given by Paulus of the surgery of\r\nthe ancients is based upon the writings of Hippocrates and Galen, as\r\nwell as upon those of Leonides, Soranus and Antyllus, one finds at\r\nevery step ample evidence that the writer possessed both independence\r\nof judgment and the manual skill which belongs to a physician who is\r\nfamiliar with surgical work.” He calls particular attention to the\r\nsection (No. 88) which deals with the manner of removing the heads of\r\narrows from wounds, and he gives special praise to Paulus for his most\r\ninstructive account of the diagnostic signs to be looked for in a case\r\nof suspected wounding of a vital organ. He is extremely thorough, says\r\nNeuburger, in his teachings about fractures and dislocations, and he\r\nnot infrequently differs from the views expressed by his predecessors.\r\n\r\nIn the section devoted to gynaecological operations Paulus makes it\r\nperfectly clear that he was in the habit of using a speculum of a very\r\npractical form. Here are his words:--\r\n\r\n   ... and, while the operator is holding the instrument in\r\n   position, an assistant turns the screw until the blades of the\r\n   instrument have been separated to the distance desired.\r\n\r\nIn other chapters of Book VI., Paulus furnishes most interesting and\r\nminute descriptions of a great variety of operations in general surgery\r\nand also in obstetrics, ophthalmology, otology and rhinology. Those who\r\ndesire to learn further details about these surgical matters should\r\nconsult the English version mentioned on a previous page.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all unlikely that at some future day it will be found\r\ndesirable--by reason of the discovery of the treatises which they\r\nare known to have written, but which have been lost--to add to this\r\nshort list of ancient medical authors the names of the following men\r\nwho are frequently quoted by them in their works: Antyllus, who made\r\nsome really valuable additions to our knowledge of the proper manner\r\nof treating aneurysms, and who must have been a surgeon of great\r\nresourcefulness; Leonides, the Alexandrian, who lived about the time of\r\nGalen, and who appears to have been highly considered for his practical\r\ncommon sense in the choice of surgical measures; Hesychios of Byzantium\r\nand his distinguished son, Jacobus Psychrestus, who was highly spoken\r\nof by his contemporaries (fifth century A. D.), in whose honor a\r\npublic statue was erected (Haller), and to whom is attributed the\r\nsaying: “A good physician should either decline at the start to take\r\ncharge of a patient, or else he should not leave him until he shall\r\nhave brought about some measure of improvement”; finally, Heliodorus,\r\nand perhaps a few others who are less well known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n     BEGINNING OF THE ARAB RENAISSANCE UNDER THE CALIPHS OF BAGDAD\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the end of the sixth century A. D. the prospects for the\r\nperpetuation and further evolution of Greek medicine looked decidedly\r\ndark. In Rome and in the larger Italian towns of the Roman Empire,\r\nphysicians were doubtless still to be found, but they must have led\r\nvery precarious lives and they certainly could not have had any leisure\r\nor opportunity for scientific work. In these earlier years of the\r\nMiddle Ages the monks conducted the larger part of whatever medical\r\npractice was required in the districts in which the monasteries were\r\nlocated. In Byzantium, also, the outlook at this period of Roman\r\nhistory was very unfavorable; and nowhere else, as a matter of fact,\r\nwould it have been possible for the casual observer to discover any\r\nsigns that indicated the approach of a revival in the study of the\r\nsciences. And yet, even at that seemingly darkest moment in the history\r\nof medicine, there were forces at work which would soon revive these\r\nprecious seeds of Greek knowledge, and, after transplanting them to\r\na richer soil, cause them to produce even better fruit and in larger\r\nquantities than ever before.\r\n\r\nThe rulers under whose auspices the first steps in the great Arab\r\nRenaissance were taken, belonged to what is known as the Abbaside\r\nDynasty, the founder of which was Abbas (566–652 A. D.), the uncle of\r\nMohammed. His descendants ruled as Caliphs of Bagdad, on the eastern\r\nbank of the Tigris, for many centuries (from 750 A. D. onward).[47]\r\nAlmansur, the second Caliph of this dynasty, felt a very strong desire\r\nthat his people, the Arabs, should acquire knowledge of all the useful\r\nbranches of learning, and more especially of medicine and philosophy;\r\nand accordingly, as the Greeks were then universally admitted to be\r\nthe only nation which possessed that knowledge, and as scarcely any\r\nscientific books written in the Arabic language existed at that early\r\ndate, he directed all his efforts to the finding of Greek originals and\r\nof the men qualified to translate them into Arabic. Already as early\r\nas the sixth century A. D., Sergius, a Christian of Ras el Ain, had\r\ntranslated a considerable number of Greek treatises into the Syrian\r\ntongue, but his work was found to be of an inferior character, and for\r\nthis reason could not be utilized to any great extent in the present\r\nundertaking. Honein (ninth century), one of the most eminent scholars\r\nof the Arabic Renaissance, revised a few of these translations and\r\nthus rendered them of some service; but by far the larger part of this\r\ngigantic task of creating Arabic versions of the classical works of\r\nGreek literature, was performed during the ninth century, a period\r\nduring which the reign of the Arabs extended from the Ganges on the\r\neast to the Atlantic on the west. By the end of the eighth century\r\nthe work of translating had advanced only to the point of producing a\r\nsingle treatise on medicine and a few relating to alchemy; but before\r\nthe ninth was completed, the Arabs had in their possession, in the form\r\nof translations, nearly all the scientific literature of Greece, and,\r\nmore than this, they could boast that not a few men belonging to their\r\nown nation had already become celebrated as scientists of the very\r\nfirst rank.\r\n\r\nThe medical school at Djondisabour[48] at the time (765 A. D.) when\r\nthe Caliph Almansur decided to carry out the ambitious scheme which\r\nhe had been meditating, was practically under the control of a family\r\nof Nestorian Christians. A large hospital formed the nucleus of the\r\ninstitution and furnished all the material needed for familiarizing the\r\nstudent with the different diseases and injuries commonly encountered\r\nin that part of the world and with the methods of treatment which, as\r\nlong experience had shown, offered the best chances of affording relief\r\nor effecting a cure. It was a clinical school of a most practical type,\r\nand at the head of it was George Bakhtichou, who had been recommended\r\nto Almansur as the physician best fitted to take responsible charge of\r\nthe new work which was then about to begin. George Bakhtichou was not\r\nthe organizer of the school at Djondisabour, but simply its head at\r\nthe time of which I am now speaking. Medicine had been taught there,\r\nit appears, since the early part of the seventh century A. D. The\r\nlanguages commonly spoken in that town were the Syrian, the Arabian\r\nand the Persian, and probably only a few persons understood Greek. The\r\nCaliph believed that, as the first and most important step in the new\r\nwork, medical text books, translations of the works of the best Greek\r\nphysicians, should be provided with as little loss of time as possible,\r\nand George Bakhtichou agreed with this opinion entirely. The latter,\r\ntherefore, upon the urgent invitation of the Caliph, left the hospital\r\nat Djondisabour in the charge of his son, Bakhtichou ben Djordis, and\r\nwent to Bagdad in company with two of his pupils, Ibrahim and Issa ben\r\nChalata. He was well received at Court, partly because he displayed a\r\nreadiness to further the Caliph’s educational plans, and partly also\r\nbecause he was promptly successful in relieving him of a distressing\r\ndyspepsia. Not long after he had arrived in Bagdad, however, he was\r\nhimself taken ill and was obliged to return to Djondisabour. Before\r\nhis departure the Caliph presented him with a gift of 10,000 pieces of\r\ngold. Issa ben Chalata, one of the two pupils whom George Bakhtichou\r\nhad brought with him to Bagdad, was left behind to look after the\r\nCaliph’s health. He proved faithless to his trust, however; and, as\r\nsoon as it was discovered that he was selling his supposed influence\r\nwith the Caliph, he was not only dismissed in disgrace but all his\r\nproperty was confiscated. After this disagreeable experience the Caliph\r\ndid his best to induce George to return to Court, but the latter was\r\nthen unable to travel, owing to the injuries which he had received\r\nfrom an accidental fall. His pupil Ibrahim went to Bagdad in his place.\r\n\r\nIt is known that George Bakhtichou personally took an active part in\r\nthe work of translating Greek medical treatises into Arabic, but it has\r\nnot yet been ascertained which books in particular were assigned to his\r\ncare in the distribution of the different tasks. Ossaibiah, the Arabian\r\nhistorian, makes the statement that the work of translating Greek\r\nmedical treatises was entirely under the control and guidance of George\r\nBakhtichou; and in the “Continens” of Rhazes frequent mention is made\r\nof the latter’s name. All of which confirms the belief that, at the\r\nbeginning of the Arabic Renaissance, George Bakhtichou was in reality\r\nthe head and front of the movement, so far at least as medicine was\r\nconcerned. When he became too old and infirm to continue his attendance\r\nat the Djondisabour hospital, he intrusted the management of that\r\ninstitution to Issa ben Thaherbakht, who was one of his best pupils. He\r\ndied in 771 A. D.\r\n\r\nIn 786 A. D., Haroun Alraschid succeeded to the caliphate; and not long\r\nafterward, on the occasion of some temporary illness, he requested\r\nBakhtichou ben Djordis, the son of George and his successor in the work\r\nof translating from the Greek, to consult with the regularly appointed\r\nphysicians of the Court in regard to the nature and proper treatment of\r\nhis malady. The consultation took place at the appointed time, and one\r\nof the Caliph’s physicians, thinking that he might catch Bakhtichou in\r\na trap, submitted to him a specimen of urine which purported to come\r\nfrom the Caliph, but which in reality had been obtained from a beast of\r\nburden. Alraschid, who knew of the deception, asked:--\r\n\r\n“What remedy would you administer to the person from whom this urine\r\ncame?”\r\n\r\nBakhtichou, who had been clever enough to recognize the true character\r\nof the specimen, replied promptly: “Some oats, your Majesty.”\r\n\r\nThe Caliph laughed heartily over the episode, loaded George’s son\r\nwith presents, and appointed him the chief of all his physicians,--the\r\nfirst instance among the Arabians, it is said, of the appointment of an\r\nArchiater.\r\n\r\nBakhtichou ben Djordis was the author of a collection of short medical\r\ntreatises, and he also wrote, for the special use of his son Gabriel, a\r\nmedical “remembrancer.” He was as highly esteemed by the Arabs as his\r\nfather had been before him. The date of his death is not known.\r\n\r\nGabriel, the son of Bakhtichou and a grandson of the famous George\r\nBakhtichou, was the most distinguished member of this remarkable\r\nfamily of physicians. In the year 792 A. D., five years after the\r\nconsultation mentioned above had taken place, Gabriel was sent by his\r\nfather to give medical advice to Jafar, the son of the Grand Vizier.\r\nThe treatment which he recommended proved to be entirely successful,\r\nand, pleased with the result, Jafar soon afterward had an opportunity\r\nto speak to Haroun Alraschid of Gabriel as the physician best fitted to\r\neffect a cure in the case of his own favorite wife, who, in a fit of\r\nyawning, had dislocated her shoulder. The Arabian physician had tried\r\nfriction, different sorts of ointments, and manipulations of every\r\nimaginable kind, but all in vain. The dislocation still persisted.\r\nWhen Gabriel arrived on the scene he told the Caliph that he could\r\nbring the shoulder back into place provided no offense would be taken\r\nat the means which he was about to employ. Alraschid gave the desired\r\npromise and Gabriel made a movement as if he were about to lift up the\r\nbedclothes. Instantly the patient, through a natural sense of modesty,\r\nstretched out her dislocated arm to keep the bed-covering in place.\r\n“There! she is cured!” exclaimed Gabriel, and such indeed was the\r\ntruth. The sudden movement of the limb had reduced the dislocation.--It\r\nonly remains for me to add that the sum of 500,000 drachmae[49] was\r\npaid to Gabriel by Haroun Alraschid for his successful treatment.\r\n\r\nSome surprise having been expressed by the Caliph’s relatives that\r\nhe should display such extravagant generosity toward a Christian, he\r\nreplied: “The fate of the empire is bound up in my fate, and my life is\r\nin the hands of Gabriel.”\r\n\r\nGabriel Bakhtichou died in the early part of the ninth century, not\r\nlong after the Caliph El Mâmoun had started on his expedition against\r\nthe Greeks (828 A. D.). He was the author of several medical treatises,\r\nand, like his famous grandfather, George Bakhtichou, he did everything\r\nin his power to promote the work of translating from the Greek\r\ninto the Arabic. Gabriel’s brother, also named George, and his son\r\nBakhtichou ben Djabriel were both of them physicians of considerable\r\ndistinction. The latter accompanied El Mâmoun on his expedition against\r\nthe Greeks. It is a fact worth noting here, that throughout this war\r\nthe Caliph never for a moment lost sight of the great national scheme\r\nof education which his predecessor Almansur had inaugurated and which\r\nwas still engaging the time and best efforts of many scholars and\r\ncopyists in Bagdad. Whenever he captured a city he insisted upon the\r\ndelivery to him of whatever copies of scientific treatises its citizens\r\nmight possess. But even these extraordinary methods of securing the\r\nbooks which they needed did not satisfy the Arabs, their eagerness\r\nto accumulate as many text books as possible being insatiable.\r\nAccordingly, from time to time, one of the translators--some member\r\nof the Bakhtichou family, for example--would be sent to the different\r\ncities of Syria and Persia to search out and get possession of as\r\nmany Greek manuscripts as possible. Thus, Honein is reported to have\r\nsaid: “I have not been able to procure a complete copy of Galen’s\r\n‘Demonstration.’ Gabriel endeavored to find a copy, but did not\r\nsucceed; and I myself hunted through Irak, Syria, Palestine and Egypt,\r\nbut was at last only partially successful. I found one-half of the text\r\nin Damascus.”\r\n\r\nThe work of translation was kept up with unremitting zeal until the\r\nmiddle of the ninth century (reigns of El Ouatocq and of Moutaouakkel).\r\n\r\nAmong the physicians who received their training at the Djondisabour\r\nmedical school the Bakhtichous were not the only ones who attained\r\nconsiderable distinction. John Mesué the Elder,[50] for example,\r\nwho was a Nestorian Christian and the son of an apothecary, became\r\nmore famous than any member of that family. He not only did his full\r\nshare of the translating, but he was also a prolific author and a\r\nvery faithful and efficient teacher, Galen’s writings furnishing the\r\nbasis of his lectures. He lived to be about eighty years of age, his\r\ndeath occurring in 857 A. D. Most of his writings have been lost. Of\r\nthe twenty or more which have come down to our time those bearing the\r\nfollowing titles deserve to receive special mention:--\r\n\r\n    Book of Fevers.\r\n    On the Different kinds of Food and Drink.\r\n    On Venesection and Scarifications.\r\n    On Tubercular Leprosy.\r\n    On Abnormal Prominence of the Abdomen.\r\n    On Purgative Remedies.\r\n    On Baths.\r\n    On the Regulation of Diet.\r\n    On Poisons and Poisoning.\r\n    On Vertigo.\r\n    On the Treatment of Sterility.\r\n    On Dentifrices and Gargles.\r\n\r\nSabour ben Sahl, whose death occurred in 869 A. D., was also connected\r\nwith the hospital at Djondisabour. He was distinguished on account\r\nof his special knowledge of the properties of simple drugs and their\r\ncombinations. He was also the author of the exhaustive formulary\r\nknown as _Acrabadin Kebir_--probably the first one of its kind,\r\nsays Le Clerc, of which history makes any mention. This formulary or\r\ndispensatory--of which a large and a small edition existed--was in\r\ngeneral use in all the hospitals, physicians’ offices, etc., of that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nStill another most distinguished physician and author of medical\r\ntreatises received his training at the Djondisabour school--viz.,\r\nJohn, son of Serapion (or Serapion the Elder, as he is commonly\r\ncalled). He lived about the middle of the ninth century of the\r\nChristian era and wrote entirely in the Syrian language, but at a later\r\ndate his works were all translated into Arabic. The smaller of his two\r\nmost important treatises, and at the same time the one which appears\r\nto have attracted the most attention, was called the Kounnach. About\r\nthe middle of the twelfth century A. D. it was translated into Latin by\r\nGerard of Cremona, and named by him _Breviarium_; a still later\r\ntranslation received the name of _Practica_. The first part of\r\nthis smaller treatise (the Breviarium or the Practica) is divided into\r\nsix books, the titles of which are as follows:--\r\n\r\n    1. On Nodosities, Ophiasis, and Alopecia.\r\n    2. On the Falling Out of the Eyelashes.\r\n    3. On the Mild Form of Tinea, the form which resembles Favus.\r\n    4. Scaly Affections of the Head and of Other Parts of the Skin.\r\n    5. Lice of the Head and of the Body.\r\n    6. Headache caused by Exposure to the Sun; and other forms of\r\n         Cephalalgia.\r\n\r\nSalmouïh ben Bayan, a Christian, was the last one of the pupils of the\r\nDjondisabour school who attained considerable celebrity as a physician.\r\nWhen the Caliph Motassem came to the throne in 833 A. D., he appointed\r\nSalmouïh his personal physician and soon became very much attached\r\nto him; leaning upon him more and more for advice in all sorts of\r\ntroubles. Salmouïh was the author of several medical treatises, but\r\nthey have all been lost, not even their titles are now known to us.\r\nWhen dying (early in 840 A. D.), he sent word to the Caliph not to\r\nput his entire trust in the medical judgment of Mesué if he should\r\nfind it necessary to call upon the latter for advice in the event of a\r\nserious attack of illness. This celebrated physician was universally\r\nadmitted to be most learned in everything relating to medicine, but\r\nthere were many of his professional brethren--and Salmouïh was among\r\nthe number--who did not esteem him so highly as a practitioner. “The\r\nmost important thing in medicine,” said the latter, “is to appreciate\r\ncorrectly the intensity of the disease, and that is something which\r\nMesué, with all his learning, is not able to do.” However, despite the\r\ndeath-bed warning given by Salmouïh to Motassem, this ruler died less\r\nthan two years later from the effects of the treatment which Mesué\r\nthe Elder, who had been called in to prescribe for his Highness, had\r\nordered.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the pupils already mentioned there are a few others who,\r\naccording to the testimony of Le Clerc, reflected some credit upon the\r\ninstitution in which they acquired their medical training. But enough\r\nhas already been said, I believe, to establish the fact that, in this\r\nremote Persian province of Khorassan (to the west of the country known\r\nto-day as Afghanistan), there existed during the eighth and ninth\r\ncenturies of the present era a most efficient medical school, which was\r\nentirely managed by Nestorian Christians, and which sent out into the\r\nworld trained physicians of the very highest type.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n     FURTHER ADVANCE OF THE ARAB RENAISSANCE DURING THE NINTH AND\r\n               SUCCEEDING CENTURIES OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the eighth century the Arab Renaissance, so\r\nfar at least as the science of medicine was concerned, was controlled\r\nand kept in vigorous life almost entirely by physicians who were\r\nconnected with the school at Djondisabour--one might almost say, by\r\nphysicians who were members of the Bakhtichou family. To this family,\r\ntherefore, belongs the chief credit for the admirable results attained\r\nduring this, the first stage of the Renaissance. But during the ninth\r\ncentury A. D. men who had not received their professional training\r\nat this famous school came to the fore and gave a fresh and a more\r\nvigorous impulse to the work than their predecessors had given. Under\r\nthe Bakhtichous the translating had been well started, and in addition\r\na few original medical treatises had been written in the Arabic\r\nlanguage. During the period which followed, however, the translating\r\nand copying became more active than before, and, in addition, several\r\nreally valuable treatises were produced by men who wrote in Arabic,\r\nand who were--if not racially Arabs--at least the adopted sons of that\r\nnation. Of these men none stands out more prominently than Honein, who,\r\naccording to Le Clerc, “accomplished a marvellous amount of work of\r\nthe most varied character and of a very high degree of excellence, and\r\nthat too despite many obstacles. While he was not the originator of the\r\nRenaissance in the East, he took the most active part in keeping it up.”\r\n\r\nHonein, who may rightly be considered as having at least inaugurated\r\nthe second stage of the Arab Renaissance, was born in 809 A. D. at\r\nHira, where his father Isaac, a Christian Arab, conducted a pharmacy.\r\nThe inhabitants of this town were known to be somewhat lacking in\r\ncultivation, and it was therefore not surprising that, when Honein\r\nwent to Bagdad and presented himself to John, the son of Mesué, as one\r\nwho wished to become his pupil, his request was promptly declined on\r\nthe general ground that the people of Hira had not received sufficient\r\neducation to warrant any one of their number in undertaking the study\r\nof medicine. This decision was of course a great disappointment to\r\nHonein, but it disturbed him only for a short time. Soon afterward he\r\nwent to Greece where he worked hard to perfect himself in the knowledge\r\nof the Greek language. Then, after a residence of two years in that\r\ncountry, he returned to Bagdad, taking with him a considerable supply\r\nof Greek books. His next step was directed toward gaining a better\r\nknowledge of Arabic, and with this object in view he spent some time\r\nin Bassora, a town which was situated not far to the south of Bagdad,\r\nand which possessed good educational facilities. While residing there\r\nhe devoted a certain portion of his time to the translation of Galen’s\r\ntreatise on anatomy; and he was accordingly prepared, upon his return\r\nto Bagdad, to submit to John, the son of Mesué, and to Gabriel, the son\r\nof Bakhtichou (who by that time was well advanced in years), a specimen\r\nof the work upon which he had been engaged. Both of these men were\r\ngreatly pleased with the excellence of the translation, and encouraged\r\nHonein to go on with the work. El Mâmoun (the second son of Haroun\r\nAlraschid), who was the then reigning Caliph, engaged his services both\r\nas a translator of Greek writings (into Syriac as well as Arabic) and\r\nas a reviser of the translations which had been made by others, and he\r\npaid him most generously for these services. According to Le Clerc,\r\nthe amount of literary work done by Honein was simply prodigious.\r\nHe translated large portions of the treatises of Galen, Oribasius\r\nand Paulus Aegineta, as well as several of the works of Aristotle\r\nand of Plato, of the mathematicians and astronomers, and also of the\r\nphilosophers; and in addition he wrote a large number of original\r\ntreatises--such, for example, as a complete set of commentaries on the\r\nwritings of Hippocrates, a practical work on the diseases of the eyes,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe following account of Honein’s experience at the Court of the Caliph\r\nMoutaouakkel (middle of the ninth century A. D.) furnishes some insight\r\ninto his character:--\r\n\r\n   The Caliph, who had heard of the great learning, ability, and\r\n   industry of Honein, but who had at the same time feared that he\r\n   might be in secret communication with the Greeks, decided to\r\n   subject him to a test that would reveal how far he was venal.\r\n   Accordingly he sent for him, clothed him in robes of honor, gave\r\n   him 50,000 drachmae, and then said:\r\n\r\n   “I wish that thou wouldst prepare for me a secret combination of\r\n   drugs which will enable me to get rid of one of my enemies.”\r\n\r\n   Honein replied: “I have no knowledge of any but salutary\r\n   remedies, and it never occurred to me that the Prince of\r\n   Believers might ask me to furnish those of a different kind.\r\n   However, if it be the wish of your Majesty, I will see what I\r\n   can do; but I shall require plenty of time.”\r\n\r\n   After waiting in vain for the desired preparation and finding\r\n   that even threats failed to accomplish anything the Caliph put\r\n   Honein in prison. Then, at the end of a year, which interval\r\n   the latter had employed diligently in the work of translating,\r\n   Moutaouakkel gave orders for the prisoner to be brought into\r\n   his presence. Before this was done, however, a heap of objects\r\n   of value was placed on one side of the room and instruments of\r\n   torture on the other. When Honein was brought in, the Caliph\r\n   said to him: “Time is passing, and my wishes have not yet been\r\n   gratified. If thou art now ready to obey my behest, these\r\n   treasures and many others in addition shall be thine. But, if\r\n   thou continuest to refuse, I will subject thee to tortures and\r\n   will finally put thee to death.”\r\n\r\n   “I have already told the Prince of Believers,” replied Honein,\r\n   “that my knowledge is limited to the preparation of salutary\r\n   remedies.”\r\n\r\n   Whereupon the Caliph said: “Have no fear! I simply wished to\r\n   test thee! But tell me, what are the reasons upon which thy\r\n   refusal is based?”\r\n\r\n   “There are two reasons,” replied Honein: “my religion and my\r\n   profession. The first teaches us to do good to our enemies;\r\n   and the second, not to do any harm to the human race. Every\r\n   physician has registered an oath that he will never administer a\r\n   poison.”\r\n\r\n   “Those are two excellent laws,” remarked the Caliph; and he\r\n   proceeded to load Honein with presents.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were associated with Honein in his work of translating\r\nGreek medical books into Arabic there are three whose names also\r\ndeserve to be remembered. They are: his son Isaac; his nephew Hobeïch;\r\nand a Christian Greek named Costa ben Luca, whose residence was at\r\nBaalbek. To men of the present time all these names of oriental\r\nphysicians are, as a rule, mere meaningless words, conveying no idea\r\nof an important relationship to the evolution of medicine. During the\r\nninth and tenth centuries of the present era, however, and indeed\r\nfor many years subsequent to that time, they were accorded by the\r\nphysicians of that period almost as much honor for the part which they\r\ntook in furthering the revival of medicine among the Arabs as was given\r\nto Honein himself. It seems therefore appropriate that at least a brief\r\naccount of the lives of these men and of the work which they did should\r\nbe given here.\r\n\r\nIsaac received his education from his father Honein, and soon after\r\nreaching manhood he was set to work translating from the Greek into\r\nboth Syrian and Arabic--two sister languages. He was a man of great\r\nintelligence, and was thought by many to be the equal of his father\r\nin the knowledge of Greek, Syriac and Arabic. He also had, like his\r\nfather, the good fortune to find favor with the rulers of that period.\r\nHe died in 912 A. D. as the result of a stroke of cerebral apoplexy.\r\nIn addition to his translations he wrote original treatises on the\r\nfollowing topics:--\r\n\r\n    Simple Medicaments.\r\n    Origins of Medicine.\r\n    Correctives of Purgative Remedies.\r\n    Treatment by Cutting Instruments.\r\n    The means of Preserving the Health and the Memory.\r\n\r\nHobeïch was the son of Honein’s sister. The date of his birth is not\r\nknown. He received his training in the languages from his uncle, and\r\nin the course of time became associated with the latter in the work\r\nof translating. Eventually he reached his uncle’s high standard of\r\nscholarship, and the text of his translations was from that time forth\r\naccepted without any revision. The Caliph Moutaouakkel appointed him\r\nCourt Physician, and the immediate successors of this Caliph retained\r\nhim in the same position. His death occurred during the second half of\r\nthe ninth century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nHobeïch translated the “Oath of Hippocrates” and a large number of the\r\nmore important of Galen’s treatises. In addition, he left to posterity\r\nseveral original writings. Quotations from these are to be found in the\r\nworks of Rhazes, of Ebn el Beithar, and of Serapion the Younger, and\r\nthey reveal two important facts: first, that Hobeïch was an excellent\r\npracticing physician; and, second, that the Arabs had already at this\r\ncomparatively early date begun to gather their medical information\r\nfrom other sources than the Greek treatises. The following drugs, for\r\nexample, are described by Hobeïch in the quotations just mentioned, and\r\nyet they do not appear to have been known to the Greek medical writers:\r\nTurbith, Convolvulus of the Nile, Nux Vomica, Colocynth, Croton\r\nTiglium, Aloes and Myrobolans.\r\n\r\nCosta, the son of Luca, was a Christian Greek from Baalbek, in Syria.\r\nThe dates of his birth and death are not known, but it is believed that\r\nhe lived during the first half of the tenth century of the present era.\r\nHe was an excellent Greek and Arabic scholar and was also familiar with\r\nthe Syriac language. His translations were esteemed equal to those\r\nof Honein. After spending some time in Greece he settled in Irak, a\r\nprovince of Persia, and devoted himself to the translation of the books\r\nwhich he had brought with him from Greece. At a later period of his\r\nlife he removed to Armenia, a country which lies to the north of Irak,\r\nbetween it and the Black Sea, and it was during his residence there\r\nthat he wrote a number of treatises. It was in Armenia, also, so far as\r\nmay be judged from the accounts which we possess, that his death took\r\nplace. As an evidence of the fact that he was highly esteemed by his\r\ncontemporaries, his biographer states that a cupola was built over his\r\ntomb.\r\n\r\nAmong the medical works which he translated from the Greek the\r\nfollowing are the only ones of special importance: The Aphorisms of\r\nHippocrates, and Galen’s commentaries upon them.\r\n\r\nThe ninth century, the period during which the major portion of the\r\nwork described in the preceding part of this chapter was accomplished,\r\nis considered by Lucien Le Clerc the most remarkable in the worlds\r\nhistory. He speaks of it in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n   Its greatness is emphasized by the fact that, except in this one\r\n   corner of the globe, everything was in a state of decadence....\r\n   Great as is the credit due the Abbaside Dynasty and its\r\n   ministers, still greater is our admiration for the Arab nation\r\n   on account of the eagerness with which it met the wishes of its\r\n   rulers and also because it pursued resolutely, and despite all\r\n   the obstacles (political and religious) which were placed in\r\n   its way, the course laid down for it to follow.... The Arabs\r\n   also knew how to choose men who were really eminent and to\r\n   rescue them from lives which otherwise would probably have been\r\n   sterile; they claimed the inheritance of Greek science; and they\r\n   revealed to the world that they were worthy of this inheritance.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the completeness of the list of Greek medical works which\r\nthe Arabs translated may be gained from the fact that Galen’s writings\r\nare more complete in the Arabic than they are in the Greek, the\r\nlanguage in which they were originally composed.\r\n\r\nWith Costa the second stage in the Arab Renaissance came to an end.\r\nAll the work accomplished at Bagdad up to this period in our history\r\nreceived its inspiration from the different Caliphs belonging to\r\nthe Abbaside Dynasty. But now the political conditions in the East\r\nunderwent a change, and other Arabian dynasties, each in its turn,\r\ngained control of the power previously wielded by Almansur, Haroun\r\nAlraschid and their successors. Fortunately, all of these new rulers\r\nseem to have been favorably inclined toward the revival of literature,\r\nand consequently the Arabs continued to take an active part in the\r\nadvance of medical knowledge during the tenth and eleventh centuries.\r\nBagdad, however, ceased to be the centre of all this intellectual\r\nactivity, and eventually Cordova in Spain almost rivaled the capital\r\nof ancient Greece in the eagerness with which she sought to increase\r\nher stores of books, and in her readiness to honor scholars. By this\r\ntime the Arabs controlled, not only Persia and Arabia, but also Egypt,\r\nPalestine, Syria, Marseilles, the coast of Asia Minor, Greece, Sicily,\r\nthe northern part of Africa and Spain. Owing to the limited space at my\r\ncommand I shall be obliged to confine my account to the more salient\r\nfeatures of the progress made during this later or third stage of the\r\nArab Renaissance.\r\n\r\nAlready as early as toward the end of the ninth century the number of\r\nphysicians in the East had increased so greatly, and the territory\r\nwhere well-educated medical men were to be found had broadened to\r\nsuch an extent, that I shall now be obliged, in order to maintain\r\nsome approach to chronological order in my account of the evolution\r\nof medical science, to treat the subject according to countries. If\r\nthe men who stand out foremost in this third stage of the scientific\r\nrenaissance are not in every instance Arabs or Persians or Syrians, I\r\nmay at least claim that they are the product, directly or indirectly,\r\nof the great Arab movement. The countries in which their best work was\r\ndone are the following: Persia (apart from Bagdad and its immediate\r\nneighborhood), Egypt, Magreb (the modern Algiers and Tunis), Fez\r\nand Spain. But, before I consider the progress of medicine in these\r\ndifferent parts of the Orient, I should say at least a few words about\r\nthe events which characterized the cessation of literary work at\r\nBagdad. As might be expected, that city, after the Greek medical and\r\nscientific treatises had all been translated into Arabic, gradually\r\nlost its pre-eminence as a centre of learning, and new centres\r\ndeveloped in other cities throughout the vast Musulman Empire. It must\r\nnot be inferred, however, that this change was wholly or even largely\r\ndue to the cessation of literary work. Other factors contributed to\r\nthis result, viz.: the decadence of the caliphate and the fact that\r\nthe caliphs themselves appeared to lose their interest in promoting\r\nthe sciences actively. It was not until during the tenth century that\r\nany further interest in the advancement of medical science was taken\r\nby those in authority at Bagdad. Then the Emir Adhad Eddoula built a\r\nsplendid hospital, and organized it on the basis of several separate\r\nservices--one for fever cases, another for accidental injuries, a third\r\nfor ophthalmic cases, and so on. Twenty-four physicians, who had been\r\nselected because of their special aptitude for some particular class of\r\nmedical work, were appointed to take charge of the different services;\r\nand it is interesting to note that nearly all of these men bear Arab\r\nnames. Nevertheless, for a still further period of many years, says Le\r\nClerc, there continued to be as many Christian as Mohammedan physicians\r\nin Bagdad.\r\n\r\nIn the tenth century other hospitals were established in Bagdad. Thus,\r\nin 914 A. D., the Vizir Ali ben Issa founded one which he endowed\r\nin the most liberal manner. This Vizir must have been a most humane\r\nperson, for, when the physician-in-charge wrote to him for further\r\ninstructions regarding the course which he should pursue with respect\r\nto people of different religions, the Vizir replied: “Use the fund for\r\nthe benefit of all classes alike, and be sure to remember the animals.”\r\n\r\n_Persia._--Rhazes, whose full name is Abou Beer Mohammed ben\r\nZakarya, is generally admitted to have been the most illustrious of\r\nPersia’s physicians, and probably the most distinguished representative\r\nof Arab medical learning. He was born at Raj, in the Province of\r\nKhorassan, about 850 A. D. After he had received his professional\r\ntraining at Bagdad, he settled at Raj and was soon afterward appointed\r\ndirector of the local hospital. At a later date he was placed in\r\ncharge of the hospital at Bagdad, but before many months had elapsed\r\nhe returned to Raj, his native town, and here he spent most of the\r\nremaining years of his long life. The date of his death is stated by\r\nHaeser as either 923 or 932 A. D., but Le Clerc mentions only the\r\nlatter date.\r\n\r\nRhazes was a very hard worker and was highly esteemed by his fellow\r\ncountrymen, who called him the Arabian Galen. The total number of\r\nwritings which he left behind him at the time of his death was\r\n237, most of them dealing with medical subjects. A few of them,\r\nhowever, were devoted to the discussion of chemical, anatomical and\r\nphilosophical questions. To-day we possess only 36 of the treatises\r\nwritten by Rhazes, and of this number only six have been printed in\r\nLatin. His greatest work, as all critics admit, is that which is\r\ncommonly known as the “Continens” (or “El Haouy”). In this work, which\r\nis divided into twenty-two books, Rhazes gives in a condensed form the\r\nviews entertained by all his predecessors regarding the more important\r\nquestions in medical science, and then adds thereto the conclusions\r\nwhich his own experience has led him to form.\r\n\r\nHe also wrote a second treatise (in ten books) which was esteemed\r\nby the physicians of that and later periods almost as highly as\r\nthe Continens. It was called the “Mansoury,” and its contents are\r\ndistributed as follows: I., Anatomy; II., the Different Temperaments;\r\nIII., Alimentary Substances and Drugs; IV., Hygiene; V., Cosmetics;\r\nVI., the Regimen to be adopted in Traveling; VII., Surgery; VIII.,\r\nPoisons; IX., Maladies in General; X., Fevers.\r\n\r\nA third treatise of considerable importance is that which is devoted\r\nby Rhazes to the description and treatment of small-pox and measles.\r\nSo far as is known at the present time this is the first treatise that\r\nhas been written on these diseases, and its celebrity rests, not only\r\nupon this circumstance, but also upon the facts that its author is\r\nevidently familiar with the different types of small-pox and with the\r\ncharacteristic features which distinguish this disease from measles.\r\nFreind, in commenting upon this treatise, says that Rhazes assigned\r\nfor small-pox a cause “entirely new in physick, a sort of an _innate\r\ncontagion_. This is a _ferment_ in the blood, like that in\r\nmust, which purifies itself sooner or later by throwing off the peccant\r\nmatter at the glands of the skin; an hypothesis since applied, though\r\nupon very slight grounds, to feavers in general by many moderns.” From\r\nthis account it is fair to conclude that Rhazes, in the tenth century\r\nof the Christian era, as clearly suspected the germ origin of certain\r\nfebrile diseases as Liebermeister did toward the end of the nineteenth,\r\nor as Fracastoro did in the sixteenth. And one cannot help exclaiming:\r\nHow many centuries had to elapse, and what an immense amount of other\r\nfacts had still to be discovered--facts in anatomy, in physiology, in\r\nchemistry, in optics, etc.--before it became possible to convert this\r\nsuspicion, this simple product of the reasoning faculty, into an actual\r\ndemonstration of the truth in pathology!\r\n\r\nAmong the Arabian physicians of the eleventh century Avicenna is\r\ncertainly one who should be placed in the first rank. He was born in\r\n980 A. D. at Afschena, a village in the Province of Khorassan, Persia,\r\nand spent his youth in Bokhara, where his father held some high office\r\nunder the Government. His great intellectual capacity was revealed at\r\nan early age. It is said, for example, that already before he was ten\r\nyears old he had committed the entire Koran to memory; and it is added,\r\nfurther, that when he was only seventeen years old he had already\r\nacquired such knowledge of medicine that he was invited to take part\r\nin a consultation regarding some malady with which the Emir Nuch ben\r\nMansur was affected. The advice which he gave on this occasion was\r\nfollowed, and in the sequel it proved so good that he was granted, as\r\na reward, unrestricted access to the royal library,--a privilege which\r\nhe utilized to the very best advantage. When his father died Avicenna\r\ncame into possession of a large fortune, which enabled him to indulge\r\nin a great deal of traveling. In this way he visited one Persian Court\r\nafter another throughout a period of several years. Finally, during a\r\nresidence at Hamadan, the Prince Schems ed-Daula, whom Avicenna had\r\nsuccessfully treated for some malady, made him his Vizir. While he\r\nheld this office he managed, without neglecting his official duties,\r\nto continue his scientific studies; but he was not able entirely to\r\nkeep out of political intrigues, and as a consequence his life was for\r\na short time in some danger. He was confined for several months in a\r\nfortress, from which, however, he managed eventually to make his escape\r\nto the Court of Ibn Kakujah, in Ispahan. He resided in that city during\r\nthe following fourteen years, and it was there that he wrote his two\r\nprincipal works--the famous medical treatise known as the “Canon,” and\r\nthe equally celebrated cyclopaedic work on philosophy. Worn out by\r\nhis incessant and most exhausting literary labors and by his excesses\r\nin other directions, Avicenna died in June, 1037 A. D., while he was\r\naccompanying the Emir on his expedition to Hamadan. His tomb may still\r\nbe seen in the latter city.\r\n\r\nNeuburger, from whose excellent History of Medicine the preceding\r\ndetails have been gleaned, makes the statement that the treatise in\r\nwhich Avicenna’s clinical experience was recorded has not come down to\r\nour time, and that, consequently, we lack the means of estimating just\r\nhow great a physician--just how close a clinical observer and how wise\r\na practitioner--he really was. So far, however, as may be judged from\r\nthe evidence furnished by the Canon, Avicenna was not the equal, in all\r\npractical matters relating to medicine, of Haly Abbas and of Rhazes.\r\nHe was perhaps too much inclined to “look at bedside phenomena through\r\nthe spectacles of preconceived theories.” In brief, he was, first and\r\nforemost, a philosopher, and only in a subordinate degree a physician,\r\nalthough a most excellent one. In Book III., where he discusses certain\r\nsurgical procedures, statements are made which justify the belief that\r\nAvicenna was acquainted with intubation of the larynx.\r\n\r\nLe Clerc mentions six other Persians who, during the tenth century of\r\nthe present era, gained more or less distinction as physicians. In the\r\nfollowing paragraphs brief notices are given of each of these men.\r\n\r\nEben el Khammar, born in 942 A. D., was a Christian and an excellent\r\npractitioner. He was well versed in the science of medicine and a\r\nwriter of some importance. Date of death unknown.\r\n\r\nAbou Sahl el Messihy, who was also a Christian, was a contemporary and\r\nintimate friend of Avicenna. He died in 1000 A. D. He was the author\r\nof a complete and very useful summary of medicine, entitled “Kitab el\r\nMeya”; and the Arab historian Ossaibiah speaks in terms of admiration\r\nof another treatise which he wrote and which bears the title,\r\n“Exposition of God’s wisdom as Manifested in the Creation of Man.”\r\n\r\nAbou Soleiman Essedjestany, commonly called “El Mantaky.” The dates\r\nof his birth and death are not known. He wrote a number of treatises,\r\nand--among others--one on “The Organization of the Human Faculties.”\r\n\r\nAboul Hassan Ahmed Etthabary, a native of Thabaristan, in the Province\r\nof Khorassan. He was employed as a physician by the Emir Rokn eddoula\r\nben Bouïh, and is known as the author of a compendium of medicine\r\nentitled: “Hippocratic Methods of Treatment.” He died in 970 A. D.\r\n\r\nEl Comry was one of the most eminent medical practitioners of his time,\r\nand was in high favor with the royal household. He wrote a compendium\r\nof medicine which bears the title “R’any ou Many,” and he was also\r\nthe author of a treatise on the causes of disease. His death occurred\r\ntoward the end of the tenth century of the Christian era.\r\n\r\nAlfaraby, who is highly commended by Avicenna, should be classed among\r\nthe philosophers rather than among the physicians. He died in 950 A. D.\r\n\r\nThe sixth Persian physician of some distinction mentioned by Le Clerc\r\nis Ali ben el Abbas--usually spoken of as Haly Abbas. The dates of his\r\nbirth and death are not stated by any of the authorities, but it is\r\nknown that he was a native of Ahouaz, a small town on the Karun river,\r\nto the southeast of Bagdad, and that he was still living in 994 A. D.\r\nHaly Abbas, it is claimed, was the first medical writer who ventured to\r\nprepare a complete and systematically arranged Practice of Medicine.\r\nHe gave it the title of Al-Maleky--“The Royal Book,”--and dedicated\r\nit to the Emir Adhad-ad-Daula, whose private physician he was. It is\r\na much smaller treatise than the “Continens” of Rhazes, and somewhat\r\nmore complete than the same author’s shorter work--the “Mansoury.” It\r\ncovers the entire field of medicine and is distinguished by its very\r\npractical character. It was first translated into Latin in 1127 A. D.\r\n\r\nHaly Abbas, in one of his treatises, speaks of Hippocrates in the\r\nfollowing terms: “Hippocrates, who is the prince of the medical art and\r\nthe first physician who ever wrote a book on this art, is the author of\r\nmany treatises on all sorts of medical topics.... But he writes in such\r\na very concise manner that much of what he says is obscure, and as a\r\nconsequence the reader, if he wishes to understand him, is obliged to\r\nseek the aid of a commentary.”\r\n\r\n_Egypt._--The dynasty of the Fatimides--the descendants of Fatima\r\n(the daughter of Mohammed) and of Ismael, a great-grandson of Ali, the\r\nfourth of Mohammed’s successors--reigned over Egypt for nearly two\r\ncenturies (10th to 12th of the present era), and they showed toward\r\nthe scientists the same spirit of generosity that had been manifested\r\ntoward them by the Abbasides in the earlier part of their reign. In 970\r\nA. D. Moëz Eddoula drove out the reigning family, assumed the title of\r\nCaliph, and founded the city of Cairo. In 972 he built the celebrated\r\nmosque Al Azhar and constructed, as a sort of annex to it, a school, a\r\nveritable university, where ultimately all the sciences were taught.\r\nIt throve vigorously, and students flocked to it in great numbers from\r\nall quarters of the Moslem empire. During the eleventh and twelfth\r\ncenturies Egypt was once more, as it had been in the palmy days of\r\nAlexandria, the home of many excellent and vigorous institutions of\r\nlearning. Among the physicians, however, who received their education\r\nin medicine at Cairo during this long period, there was not one who\r\nattained great eminence.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the eleventh century the Crusaders, under the leadership\r\nof Godfrey de Bouillon and others, made their first serious attack\r\non Palestine and Syria, and from that time onward, for about two\r\ncenturies, they and the different armies sent out successively\r\nfrom Europe carried on almost constant warfare, which Michaud the\r\ndistinguished French historian (about 1800 A. D.) calls the product\r\nof a pious delirium. Wars of religion are the most savage and pitiless\r\nof all wars, says Le Clerc, and this was emphatically true of those\r\nwaged by the Crusaders. On the other hand, says the same writer, “the\r\ntolerance exhibited at that period by the Arabs in religious matters\r\nis a well-attested fact, and it owes its origin to the circumstance\r\nthat their scientific education was conducted by Christians. Of\r\nSaladin’s fifteen physicians two-thirds were either Jews or Christians.\r\nCultivation and good training were the characteristics of the Arabs\r\nat that period of their history, whereas fanaticism and brute force\r\nwere the distinguishing features of the European soldiers. Several\r\nhundred thousand adventurers first ravaged Europe and then pounced\r\nupon Asia. At Antioch Godfrey de Bouillon committed all sorts of\r\nexcesses, and then, when he had taken Jerusalem, he massacred 70,000\r\nof its inhabitants--Jews and Musulmans. Eighty years later, Saladin\r\nretook Jerusalem; and, with the exception of a comparatively small\r\nnumber, he allowed all of his captives to go free. His brother, Malek\r\nel Adel, paid the ransom of 2000 of the prisoners. Contrast these\r\nfruits of civilization with the barbarism of the European conquerors\r\nunder Godfrey de Bouillon. Another result of the Crusades was this:\r\nThe Franks lost a good deal of their savagery through contact with the\r\nArabs. At a still later period Western Europe drew a large part of her\r\nsupplies of knowledge from Spain--_i.e._, from the Musulmans.”\r\n\r\n_Syria._--In the thirteenth century Damascus, the capital of\r\nSyria, assumed considerable importance as a centre of medical activity.\r\nBagdad and Cairo had by this time lost the greater part of their\r\nattractiveness for those who wished to perfect their knowledge of\r\nthe healing art, and the vandalism of the so-called Soldiers of the\r\nCross had put an end for many years to come to all hopes of making\r\nConstantinople once more the home of scientific or artistic effort.\r\nThere was one branch of medical practice, however, in which the Cairo\r\nphysicians excelled all others--that, namely, of ophthalmology. This is\r\nexplained by the well-known fact that at all periods of her history\r\nEgypt has been afflicted with ophthalmias to a much greater degree than\r\nany of the other countries of the Mediterranean basin. The great wealth\r\naccumulated in Damascus, the large number of hospitals which were\r\nlocated in the city, and the attractiveness of the town as a place of\r\nresidence undoubtedly had much to do with the fact that it attained at\r\nthis period so great popularity as a centre of medical activity.\r\n\r\n_Spain._--During the tenth century of the present era the Moslem\r\nreign in Spain flourished greatly under the two enlightened rulers\r\nof the Ommiade Dynasty--Abdurrahman Ennasser and Hakem, and medicine\r\nshared fully in this prosperity. During Abdurrahman’s reign the Emperor\r\nRomanus at Constantinople sent an embassy to Cordova in Spain, and\r\namong the gifts which they took with them for the Prince, was a copy\r\nof the treatise of Dioscorides in the original Greek, illustrated by\r\nmarvelously beautiful paintings of the different medicinal plants.\r\nBut there was nobody in Cordova at that time who could read Greek.\r\nAccordingly, Abdurrahman begged the Emperor to send him a man who was\r\nfamiliar with both the Greek and the Latin tongues, and it was in\r\nanswer to this request that the monk Nicholas was sent to Cordova (951\r\nA. D.). Working in conjunction with several of the most distinguished\r\nphysicians of that city he succeeded in identifying nearly all of the\r\nplants mentioned by Dioscorides.\r\n\r\nAmong the physicians of Arab, Persian or Jewish extraction who, during\r\nthe eleventh and twelfth centuries, practiced their profession in Spain\r\nand attained considerable celebrity, the following deserve to receive\r\nspecial mention here: Abulcasis, Avenzoar, Averroes and Maimonides.\r\n\r\n_Abulcasis._--Abulcasis is universally credited with being the\r\ngreatest surgeon of whom the Arabs may rightfully boast. He was born\r\nat Zahra near Cordova in 936 A. D., and his death occurred 1013 A.\r\nD. Quite early in his professional career (before he had reached his\r\ntwenty-fifth year) he was appointed one of Abdurrahman’s private\r\nphysicians. Although he owes his reputation chiefly to the treatises\r\nwhich he wrote on surgery Abulcasis was also the author of several\r\nmedical works. He published a collection of all his writings under the\r\ntitle of “The Tesrif,” which is divided into thirty parts or books,\r\nand which--according to Lucien Le Clerc--constitutes a veritable\r\nencyclopaedia. During the course of the twelfth century Gerard of\r\nCremona translated into Latin the part relating to surgery; it is not\r\nknown at what time or by whom the remainder of the collection was\r\ntranslated. The author’s name in the Latin edition is given, not as\r\nAbulcasis, but as Alsaharavius.\r\n\r\nDuring the lifetime of Abulcasis his writings, and especially his work\r\non surgery, were not very highly appreciated in Spain. This was largely\r\ndue to the fact that the Mohammedan inhabitants of that country did not\r\nlook upon surgery with any degree of favor. The Arabs of the East held\r\nAbulcasis in much greater honor. Guy de Chauliac, the famous French\r\nsurgeon of the fourteenth century, in his treatise on surgery, quotes\r\nAbulcasis no less than two hundred times. Le Clerc, in the course\r\nof his remarks upon the value of the surgical treatise written by\r\nAbulcasis, says: “This book will always be considered, in the history\r\nof medicine, to represent the first formal and distinct scientific\r\ntreatise on surgery.” At the same time, the prevailing testimony makes\r\nit appear that the book contains only a small portion of original\r\nmatter, a large part of its substance having been borrowed from the\r\nwork of the Greek author, Paulus Aegineta. Its chief merit consists in\r\nthe orderly and very clear manner in which the facts are presented, and\r\ndoubtless the popularity of the book was materially increased by the\r\nfact that many of the instruments required for the different operations\r\nwere illustrated pictorially.\r\n\r\nLucien Le Clerc has published (Paris, 1861) a French translation of\r\nAbulcasis’ Treatise on Surgery, and on page 71 of this version the\r\nfollowing statement will be found:--\r\n\r\n   ... you may also introduce into the cannula a specially adapted\r\n   piston in copper, or a stylet the end of which is armed with\r\n   cotton. Then fill the cannula with oil or some other suitable\r\n   fluid, introduce into one end the stylet armed with cotton, and\r\n   push it onward until the liquid enters the ear.\r\n\r\nEdouard Nicaise, commenting on these words in his version of Guy de\r\nChauliac’s _La Grande Chirurgie_ (page 690), says that they\r\nconstitute the first reference, thus far discovered in medical\r\nliterature, to the use of the instrument known as a syringe.\r\n\r\n_Avenzoar._--Avenzoar was born in Seville, in the southern part\r\nof Spain, during the latter part of the eleventh century. The exact\r\ndate is not known. His father was a physician of some distinction, and\r\nhis son also attained considerable eminence in the same profession.\r\nAccording to Neuburger, Avenzoar died, at an advanced age, in 1162 A.\r\nD., and was buried in Seville.\r\n\r\nIt is said that in actual practice Avenzoar, who was a man of some\r\nwealth, confined himself to consultation work. He considered it beneath\r\nthe dignity of a physician to prepare drugs, to apply leeches, or\r\nto perform certain surgical operations--as, for example, lithotomy;\r\nbut Le Clerc seems disposed to believe that Avenzoar did not adopt\r\nthis view until after he had become somewhat celebrated and had\r\naccumulated a fortune. Neuburger ranks him next to Rhazes as a clinical\r\nobserver and a practitioner of sound common sense, and he speaks of\r\nhis great medical work, the Teïssir, as a treatise that abounds in\r\nmost interesting histories of cases of disease. Among these will be\r\nfound the account of an attack of mediastinitis which occurred in\r\nhis own person, and which ended in suppuration that found a vent for\r\nits products by way of one of the bronchi.[51] As this disease is of\r\nrare occurrence, and as Freind’s account of the attack is presumably\r\na translation of the original report in Arabic made by Avenzoar, its\r\nreproduction here may be interesting. I shall take the liberty of\r\nmodernizing the text very slightly and of abbreviating it in one or two\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n   I felt some pain in the region of the mediastinum (the membrane\r\n   which divides the thorax in the middle) while I was on a\r\n   journey. As it increased a cough developed, and I observed\r\n   that my pulse was very hard and that I had an acute fever. On\r\n   the fourth night I took away a pint of blood, but this gave me\r\n   very little relief. Being obliged to travel all day I was much\r\n   fatigued when I retired at night, and I fell asleep. During my\r\n   sleep the bandage on the arm came off, and when I awoke I found\r\n   the bed deluged with blood and my strength greatly exhausted.\r\n   The next day I began to cough up a sanious matter, and my mind\r\n   wandered at times. Gradually all the symptoms subsided and I\r\n   recovered my health. Although I partook of large quantities of\r\n   barley water, I believe that my recovery was not due to this,\r\n   but rather to the great loss of blood which I had experienced.\r\n\r\nFreind adds that “Avenzoar not only takes notice of an abscess in the\r\nmediastinum, but in the pericardium likewise; which I don’t find had\r\nbeen described or even observed by any of the Greeks or Arabians: and\r\nthere is no doubt but this membrane and the mediastinum to which it\r\nis contiguous, are subject, as well as the pleura and lungs, to an\r\ninflammation.”\r\n\r\nIt is one of the distinguishing features of Avenzoar’s character that,\r\nin his writings, he does not hesitate to differ from his predecessors\r\nwhenever he believes that their views are erroneous.\r\n\r\n_Averroes._--Averroes was one of Avenzoar’s most distinguished\r\npupils. Indeed, the latter’s famous work, the Teïssir, is dedicated to\r\nAverroes. Thanks to the distinguished French historian and philosopher,\r\nErnest Renan, our knowledge of Averroes has been greatly expanded since\r\n1852. Averroes was born at Cordova in 1126 A. D. His father and his\r\ngrandfather had both held the office of Cadhi (Alcalde, in Spanish),\r\nand were therefore people of importance in that city. His studies were\r\nconfined at first largely to philosophy, and when he reached mature\r\nage he gained a great reputation as the commentator and interpreter of\r\nthe writings of Aristotle. Still later in life much of his attention\r\nwas devoted to medicine, and he wrote a book which bears the title\r\n“Kitab al-kullidschat” (General principles of Medicine). Among the\r\nphysicians of the later Middle Ages this work was commonly spoken of as\r\nthe “Colliget” (from kullidschat), and was almost as highly esteemed as\r\nthe Canon of Avicenna. The idea of writing a treatise on the individual\r\ndiseases was first entertained, among Arabian physicians, by Averroes;\r\nbut on reflection he abandoned the idea, and, instead, urged Avenzoar,\r\nhis friend and former instructor, to undertake the work in his place.\r\nIt was in this way that the Teïssir--the finest work on the practice of\r\nmedicine produced by an Arab writer--came to be written.\r\n\r\nThe topics treated in the “Colliget” are distributed throughout the\r\nseven books in the following manner:--\r\n\r\n    Book I.   Anatomy.\r\n    Book II.  Health (Physiology).\r\n    Book III. Diseases.\r\n    Book IV.  Signs or Symptoms.\r\n    Book V.   Remedial agents and Foods.\r\n    Book VI.  The Preservation of Health.\r\n    Book VII. The Treatment of Diseases.\r\n\r\nNeuburger speaks of the “Colliget” as a fine piece of philosophical\r\nwriting, but adds that it is not at all suited to the needs of the\r\npractical physician. Indeed, he doubts whether any person who has not\r\nreceived a thorough training in natural philosophy--the philosophy of\r\nAristotle--would be able to follow the author intelligently.\r\n\r\n_Maimonides._--Maimonides, who is ranked by Le Clerc as the\r\ngreatest Jew, after Moses, of whom the history of that nation makes\r\nmention, was born at Cordova, Spain, in 1135 A. D. In early youth\r\nhis teachers were his father and a disciple of Ebn Badja. At the age\r\nof thirteen, and from that time until he had reached his thirtieth\r\nyear, he was obliged under the pressure of circumstances, to profess,\r\nat least outwardly, the faith of Islam. Death or banishment was\r\nthe only alternative. During the intervening period of seventeen\r\nyears he devoted himself exclusively to his studies. In 1160 A. D.\r\nhe accompanied his family to Fez, Morocco, and five years later he\r\nsettled at Fostath, near Cairo, Egypt. As a means of gaining his\r\nlivelihood he engaged in the business of trafficking in precious\r\nstones, continuing his studies at the same time and carrying on a\r\ncertain amount of medical practice. Not long afterward he gained the\r\nfavor of the Vizir El Fadhl Beissâny, the friend of Saladin, Sultan of\r\nEgypt and Syria, and was by him appointed one of the Court physicians.\r\nThis enabled him to give up entirely his commercial business. He\r\nprospered in the practice of medicine and was very highly esteemed in\r\nthe community in which he lived. His death occurred in 1204 A. D.\r\n\r\nAmong the books which he wrote (generally in Arabic) on medical\r\nsubjects, the following deserve to receive special mention:--\r\n\r\n   I. Commentary on the Aphorisms of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n   II. A work known as “Aphorisms of Maimonides” (borrowed partly\r\n         from Hippocrates and partly from Galen).\r\n\r\n   III. Résumé of the writings of Galen.\r\n\r\n   IV. A letter relating to the subject of personal hygiene.\r\n\r\n   V.-IX. Treatises on asthma; on hemorrhoids; on venoms and\r\n         poisons in general; on drugs; and on forbidden articles\r\n         of diet.\r\n\r\n   X. A translation of one of Avicenna’s works.\r\n\r\nNeuburger speaks in very favorable terms of the medical writings of\r\nMaimonides, and adds that he also wrote a treatise which bears the\r\ntitle: “Guide to Those in Perplexity”--a work which aims to reconcile\r\nreason and faith. The book has been translated into French by Munk; and\r\nthe treatise on poisons has also been translated into the same language\r\nby J. M. Rabbinowicz (Paris, 1867).\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the remarkable manner in which philosophy and medicine had\r\nflourished in Spain during the tenth and eleventh centuries, under the\r\nreigns of Haken II. and his successors, Ernest Renan says:\r\n\r\n   The love of science and of things beautiful had established,\r\n   in that privileged corner of the world, a degree of tolerance\r\n   that can scarcely be matched in modern times. Christians, Jews,\r\n   Musulmans all spoke the same language, sang the same poems, and\r\n   took part in the same literary and scientific studies. All the\r\n   barriers which commonly separate men were thrown down, and all\r\n   worked with equal zeal in behalf of our common civilization.\r\n\r\nWith the death of Averroes (1198 A. D.), however, Arab philosophy lost\r\nits last representative, and the Koran resumed its full authority over\r\nfreedom of thought. In the succeeding period of decadence (thirteenth\r\ncentury of the Christian era) there were no physicians of first\r\nimportance, at least in Spain and Persia; and even in Egypt and Syria,\r\nover which reigned at this time the enlightened family of Saladin,\r\nthe leading physicians were not of the same calibre as the men whose\r\nnames I have just mentioned. Bagdad and Cordova had by this time become\r\ncities of less importance than Damascus, and botany and ophthalmology\r\nwere esteemed of greater value in the scheme of medical education\r\nthan at any previous time. It will not appear strange, however,\r\nthat medicine should have stood still during this later part of the\r\nMiddle Ages if we bear in mind the fact that warfare was then such a\r\nfrequently occurring event that nobody had either time or inclination\r\nfor scientific studies. The invasions of the Mongolians and the\r\nCrusaders were most disturbing factors.\r\n\r\nDuring the twelfth century of the present era there were--so we are\r\nassured by Le Clerc--women physicians among the Arabs in Spain. It is\r\nsaid, for example, that Abou Bekr, a distinguished medical practitioner\r\nof that period, had a sister who was well trained in medicine, and that\r\nit was she who acted as midwife at all the confinements of the wives of\r\nthe Caliph Almansur. After her death her niece officiated in the same\r\ncapacity in her place. There can scarcely be any reasonable doubt that,\r\nalmost from time immemorial, women as well as men have taken active\r\npart in the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\nAccording to Puschmann, Spain possessed, during the twelfth century of\r\nthe Christian era, seventy public libraries and seventeen institutions\r\nfor instruction in the higher branches of learning. Among the residents\r\nof the city of Cordova there were, during the same period, no fewer\r\nthan one hundred and fifty authors; and the smaller cities of Almeria,\r\nMurcia and Malaga could each claim proportionally an equally large\r\nnumber, viz., fifty-two, sixty-one and fifty-three.\r\n\r\n_The Effects of the Arab Renaissance as a Whole upon the Evolution of\r\nMedicine._--Although the series of events which I have endeavored\r\nto sketch here in brief outlines reveals an extraordinary degree of\r\nzeal and persistence on the part of the Arab rulers and their subjects\r\nto endow the nation with the knowledge and skill of their models,\r\nthe Greeks, the final results gained, at least so far as they relate\r\nto the evolution of medicine as a whole, were not very great. The\r\nmovement lasted for five or six centuries, but nevertheless only a few\r\nrelatively unimportant facts were added by the Arabs to the stock of\r\nknowledge which was possessed at the time of Galen’s death. Alhazen’s\r\nbrilliant researches in the eleventh century of our era in optics (more\r\nparticularly with reference to refraction) paved the way for a more\r\nperfect knowledge, in modern times, of the physiology of vision; Geber,\r\nwho lived during the eighth century of the Christian era, and who is\r\nspoken of by Le Clerc as “occupying the same place in the history of\r\nchemistry that Hippocrates does in the history of medicine,” laid the\r\nfoundations of that important branch of science; Abulcasis discovered\r\nthe Medina worm (_dracunculus Medinensis_) and wrote an excellent\r\ndescription of the pathological effects which it produces when it\r\nlodges under the skin of a man’s leg; and, finally, our pharmacopoeia\r\nwas enriched, during these centuries, by the addition to it of a number\r\nof new drugs and pharmaceutical preparations. These are among the more\r\nimportant contributions which the Arabs made to the general stock of\r\nmedical knowledge. On the other hand, they contributed, in an indirect\r\nmanner, to the advance of the science of medicine. From the thirteenth\r\ncentury onward, for a long period, the Latin language was destined to\r\nserve as the vehicle by means of which all scientific knowledge was\r\nto be spread abroad in the countries which are now known as Italy,\r\nSpain, France, Switzerland, Germany, Belgium and Holland, and therefore\r\nan immense amount of translating had to be done before the works of\r\nHippocrates, Galen and other Greek medical authors could be brought\r\nwithin reach of the physicians of these different countries. At that\r\nlate date it was by no means always feasible to get possession of an\r\noriginal copy of one of these classical treatises, and consequently in\r\nsuch cases it became necessary to employ an Arabic version in the place\r\nof the Greek original. It was in this indirect manner, therefore, that\r\nthe Mohammedan Renaissance contributed most effectively in advancing\r\nthe development of medical science in general.\r\n\r\nOne cannot dismiss the subject of Arabic medicine without calling\r\nattention once more to the spectacle which this remarkable Renaissance\r\noffers--that of an entire nation deliberately working to educate itself\r\nup to the level of such intellectual and artistic giants as the ancient\r\nGreeks; a work which continued with unabated zeal throughout several\r\ncenturies in spite of obstacles and discouragements, and which never\r\nceased for a moment. It is a spectacle without parallel in the world’s\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n             HOSPITALS AND MONASTERIES IN THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nLong before the Christian era it was the practice among the Greeks\r\nto make suitable provision for those who, by reason of poverty or\r\nillness, were unable to provide for their own wants or to secure the\r\nservices of a physician. Their slaves, for example, were sent, when\r\novertaken with illness, or when they had become too feeble to work, to\r\nwhat was termed _Xenodochia_--institutions where they received\r\nkindly care and such medical treatment as was necessary. (Mommsen.) In\r\nstrong contrast with this humane practice stands the action of those\r\nwealthy Roman property owners who, adopting the course recommended by\r\nCato, the famous censor (96–46 B. C.), “sold their slaves when they\r\nbecame old and feeble or ill, as they would old iron, or oxen that\r\ncan no longer be utilized for work.” This cruel practice not only\r\ncontinued throughout a period of nearly three centuries, but apparently\r\nbecame more and more common, for we are told that the Emperor Claudius\r\n(268–270 A. D.) was obliged, in order to mitigate the evil, to issue a\r\ndecree that, when a slave was driven out of the house by his owner, he\r\nshould be declared free.\r\n\r\n_Hospitals and Other Kindred Institutions._--Toward the end of the\r\nfourth century of the present era the first hospital was established in\r\nRome by the widow Fabiola, a member of the distinguished Fabian family,\r\nand her example induced other wealthy Roman ladies to found similar\r\ninstitutions. But already several years before this time the influence\r\nof Christianity had made itself felt so strongly in the eastern branch\r\nof the Roman Empire that the Emperor Julian, who had previously been\r\namong its most bitter opponents, was forced to say, in one of his\r\nletters:--\r\n\r\n   Now we can see what it is that makes these Christians such\r\n   powerful enemies of our gods; it is the brotherly love which\r\n   they manifest toward strangers and toward the sick and the poor,\r\n   the thoughtful manner in which they care for the dead, and the\r\n   purity of their own lives.\r\n\r\nMoved by these considerations, he decided forthwith to erect hospitals\r\nin all the cities of the empire. We do not know whether he acted upon\r\nthis resolution or not, but it is a matter of record that St. Basil,\r\nBishop of Caesarea (370–379 A. D.), founded in that city, which is\r\nabout thirty miles distant from Jerusalem, a settlement composed of\r\nnumerous dwellings that were devoted to the use of the poor and the\r\nsick. This institution was managed in an admirable manner, a special\r\ncorps of physicians and nurses being assigned to the duty of caring for\r\nits inmates. At Edessa, the capital of Northern Mesopotamia, another\r\nhospital was founded in 375 A. D. The date of the establishment of the\r\ncelebrated hospital at Djondisabour in Persia, of which mention is made\r\nelsewhere (see page 204 _et seq._), is not known. About the middle\r\nof the sixth century of the present era, Childebert I., King of the\r\nFranks and son of Clovis, founded at Lyons, France, the Hôtel-Dieu, a\r\nhospital which has afforded shelter and comfort to thousands of human\r\nbeings during the past fourteen hundred years, and which is in active\r\noperation at the present time; a hospital, too, which has served as a\r\ntraining school for a long line of distinguished physicians, surgeons\r\nand gynaecologists. It is an interesting fact that Childebert intrusted\r\nthe management of this great institution to laymen (instead of the\r\necclesiastical powers). Finally, toward the end of the sixth century,\r\nBishop Masona founded in Merida, Spain, a hospital in which Jews,\r\nslaves and freemen were received and treated on the same footing; and\r\nhe laid down the rule that one-half of the moneys and other gifts\r\nreceived by the church was to be devoted to the maintenance of this\r\ninstitution. The list of hospitals and other charitable organizations\r\nwhich were established in these early centuries is very long, and it\r\nreveals the fact that in every known land there existed, throughout\r\nthese years, a strong wish to give aid and comfort to the poor, the\r\nsick and the helpless. The Musulmans appear to have been as zealous\r\nas the Christians in promoting works of this kind; for the records\r\nshow that in Bagdad, Cairo, Damascus, Cordova and many of the other\r\ncities which were under their control, they provided ample hospital\r\naccommodations. Indeed, one of the largest and most perfectly equipped\r\ninstitutions of this character of which the history of the Middle\r\nAges furnishes any record, was that planned and constructed at Cairo,\r\nEgypt, in 1283 A. D., by the Sultan El Mansur Gilavun. While it was\r\nbuilding, the workmen employed were not permitted to engage in any\r\nundertaking for private citizens, and the Sultan himself never failed\r\nto visit the spot every day during the progress of the work. The site\r\nchosen was that of one of the royal palaces, and in tearing down this\r\nstructure, in order to make room for the new building, the workmen\r\nbrought to light a large chest filled with gold and precious stones,\r\nthe value of which was sufficient to pay the entire expense of erecting\r\nthe hospital. Upon the completion of the building and the equipment\r\nof its spacious wards in the most perfect manner possible, the Sultan\r\nexpressed himself in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n   I have founded this institution for people of my own class\r\n   and for those who occupy an humbler station in life--for the\r\n   king and for the servant, for the common soldier and for the\r\n   Emir, for the rich man and for the poor, for the freeman and\r\n   for the slave, for men and also for women. I have made ample\r\n   provision for all the remedial agents that may be required, for\r\n   physicians, and for everything else that may prove useful in any\r\n   form of illness....\r\n\r\nOne of the characteristic features in the management of this hospital,\r\nsays Le Clerc, was the custom of giving to each of the poorer inmates,\r\nwhen he left the institution, five pieces of gold, in order that he\r\nmight be spared the necessity of undertaking immediately work of an\r\nexhausting character.\r\n\r\n_Monasteries in Their Relation to Medicine._--While at first\r\nthese institutions were designed chiefly as places of refuge from\r\nthe turmoil of the world and from the violence of frequent warfare,\r\nit became evident in the course of time that the evils incident to\r\nsuch a secluded and self-centered life hindered rather than promoted\r\nthe development of those particular virtues which Jesus Christ urged\r\nhis followers to cultivate. This experience led to the adoption of\r\na different kind of cloister life; and so it came about, as stated\r\nby Neuburger, that in 529 A. D. Benedictus of Nursia founded, at an\r\nisolated spot high up on the slope of Monte Cassino, in Campania,\r\nItaly, the now famous parent monastery of the Benedictine Order.\r\nAccording to the original regulations of this order, the monks were\r\nobliged to perform every day a certain amount of manual labor as well\r\nas devotional exercises. Nine years later Cassiodorus, who had for\r\na long period been a sort of Secretary of State under Theodoric the\r\nGreat and his successors, became a monk, and, from that time to the\r\nday of his death, “devoted all his energies to the service of God\r\nand the advancement of science.” He secured a house not far from the\r\nBenedictine monastery on Monte Cassino, gathered together there a\r\nconsiderable library, and made it a rule of the place that the copying\r\nof original codices (the majority of them theological) constituted\r\nthe most useful and honorable form of manual labor. A few years\r\nlater, this smaller establishment was made a part of the monastery at\r\nMonte Cassino, and the rule just mentioned was thereafter adopted by\r\nthe enlarged institution. But the care of the sick, the feeble, and\r\nchildren was the particular work which Benedictus, the founder of this\r\ninstitution, had most at heart. Cassiodorus went even farther and urged\r\nupon the brethren the desirability of studying the healing art and of\r\nutilizing, for this purpose, the works of ancient medical authors.\r\n\r\n   Learn all you can, he said, about the characteristics of\r\n   different plants and about the methods of preparing medicinal\r\n   mixtures, but set all your hopes upon the Lord who is the\r\n   preserver of our lives. In your search for knowledge about\r\n   drugs consult the herbarium of Dioscorides, who has described\r\n   and pictured the different herbs with great accuracy. Afterward\r\n   read Latin translations of the works written by Hippocrates and\r\n   by Galen, particularly the latter’s treatise on therapeutics,\r\n   the one which he addresses to the philosopher Glaucon; and, in\r\n   addition, study the work of Caelius Aurelianus on the practice\r\n   of medicine, that of Hippocrates on medicinal plants and methods\r\n   of treatment, and some of the other writings on medicine which\r\n   you will find in my library and which I have left behind me for\r\n   the benefit of my brethren in this institution.\r\n\r\nThe advice given by Cassiodorus was heeded, not only by those to whom\r\nit was addressed, but also by many succeeding generations of monks.\r\nEven at the present time, says Neuburger, the books which Cassiodorus\r\nrecommended are still to be found, either in the form of original\r\nmanuscript copies or in that of translations, in the library of the\r\nparent institution. Furthermore, when it is remembered how large a\r\nnumber of affiliated Benedictine monasteries were established in\r\ndifferent parts of Europe, it will readily be appreciated that the good\r\naccomplished by the advice which Cassiodorus gave must have been very\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\nAmong the later abbots of Monte Cassino there were three who attained\r\nconsiderable distinction as physicians. They were Bertharius, who wrote\r\ntwo treatises on medical topics; Alphanus II., Archbishop of Salerno,\r\nwho was celebrated both as a physician and as a poet; and Desiderius\r\n(1027–1087 A. D.), who was skilled, not only in medicine, but also in\r\njurisprudence, and who was elected Pope under the title of Victor III.\r\nThe monastery attained the height of its celebrity at the time when\r\nConstantinus the African became one of its regular members. Although\r\nConstantinus was a native Arab (born at Carthage about 1018 A. D.),\r\nhe became converted to Christianity quite early in life. It is said\r\nthat he was a great traveler as well as a great scholar, and that he\r\ndevoted several years to visiting foreign lands--Babylonia, India,\r\nEgypt and Ethiopia. It was in this way that he became so well versed in\r\nthe languages of the East. Upon visiting Spain as a fugitive from his\r\nnative city, he took with him several of the works of Hippocrates and\r\nGalen, and in course of time translated them into Latin. Finally, he\r\naccepted the position of secretary to Robert Guiscard, the first Norman\r\nDuke of Calabria and Apulia, who appears to have selected Salerno as\r\nhis place of residence. At the same time he became one of the teachers\r\nat the medical school of that city, and served in this capacity for a\r\ncertain length of time; but, at the end of a few years, he was formally\r\naccepted by the Abbot Desiderius as a member of the Monte Cassino\r\ncommunity, and it was here that he did the larger part of his literary\r\nwork. His death occurred in 1087 A. D., the same year in which the\r\nAbbot Desiderius--or, rather, Pope Victor III.--died.\r\n\r\nConstantinus was a prodigious worker, but it is doubtful whether he did\r\nanything of an original character. Not a few of the treatises which\r\nwere, at that time, credited to him as original productions, are now\r\nknown--thanks largely to the researches of the great French historian\r\nand linguist, Daremberg--to be simply translations from the Arabic.\r\n\r\nIt is believed by some authorities that at Monte Cassino medicine was\r\ntaught to laymen as well as to those who were preparing to become\r\nmembers of the Benedictine Order of monks. It is not likely, however,\r\nthat this was done to any great extent, as much better facilities for\r\nacquiring knowledge of medicine were available at Salerno in the near\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of Gaul, in the early Middle Ages, physicians received\r\nvery little consideration; indeed, to us moderns it seems strange\r\nthat any one should have possessed sufficient courage to accept\r\nthe responsibility of prescribing for a member of one of the royal\r\nfamilies. It is related by Neuburger, on the authority of Gregory of\r\nTours’ History of the Franks, that when Austrichildis, the wife of King\r\nGuntram (sixth century A. D.), was ill with the plague and perceived\r\nthat her death was near at hand, she sent for her husband and extracted\r\nfrom him a promise that he would behead the two physicians, Nicolaus\r\nand Donatus, who had treated her and whose prescriptions had failed to\r\neffect a cure. Her wish was carried out, in order--as the statement\r\nreads--“that her Majesty might not enter the Realm of the Dead entirely\r\nalone.” Many centuries later, however, when civilization had certainly\r\nadvanced far beyond the stage which it had reached in Gaul in the sixth\r\ncentury of the present era, there were instances in which able and\r\nconscientious physicians were subjected to equally cruel treatment for\r\ntheir failure to effect a cure.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this same period, as is amply verified by the\r\nstatements made by Bishop Gregory of Tours, that faith in the power of\r\nsaintly relics to heal diseases became almost universal. So great was\r\nthe effect produced upon the minds of the people by the public display\r\nof these objects--bones of saints, portions of their grave-stones,\r\netc.--that a large number of marvelous cures were reported as the\r\nresult of such displays; and doubtless--so great is the power of\r\nsuggestion over the human mind--many of these reports were true. A\r\ncentury later (673–735 A. D.), the Venerable Bede, author of the famous\r\nwork entitled “Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation,” gave, in\r\nthe course of his narrative, an account of a case of aphasia in which\r\n“a remarkable cure was effected”; and, although he mentions a course\r\nof “systematic exercises in speaking” as the means used to effect that\r\ncure, he attributes it to supernatural causes and not to the practical\r\ntreatment adopted. He also describes some of the epidemics of his time,\r\nand gives most interesting though brief accounts of the methods of\r\ntreatment employed by the priests and the monks.\r\n\r\nDuring the ninth and tenth centuries, as we learn from the very full\r\ndescriptions given by Neuburger in his History of Medicine, much zeal\r\nwas manifested by the monks at St. Gall in Switzerland, at Reichenau in\r\nSaxony, and at Fulda, in Hesse Nassau, in the study of the different\r\nbranches of knowledge, medicine included. The following are the names\r\nof those monks who attained the greatest distinction in this work:\r\nHrabanus Maurus, Abbot of the Fulda Monastery, afterward Archbishop\r\nof Mayence, and the author of an encyclopaedia in which the science of\r\nmedicine receives quite full consideration; and Walahfrid Strabo, a\r\npupil of Maurus, Abbot of Reichenau, and the author of a treatise in\r\nverse on medicinal plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n       MEDICAL INSTRUCTION AT SALERNO, ITALY, IN THE MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe date of origin of the Medical School at Salerno is not known,\r\nbut such evidence as we possess shows without a doubt that already\r\nin the earliest part of the Middle Ages some sort of facilities for\r\nstudying medicine were provided in that little town--the _Civitas\r\nHippocratica_, as it was called at a later period. It seems to\r\nbe the general impression, says Daremberg, that during those early\r\ncenturies only ignorance and superstition prevailed in Italy and Gaul;\r\nin other words, that all desire for scientific research had vanished,\r\nand that there no longer existed such a thing as the regular practice\r\nof medicine. This impression, he adds, is erroneous. History shows\r\nthat schools modeled after those established by the Merovingian and\r\nCarlovingian kings (448–639 A. D.), existed up to as recent a date as\r\nthe middle of the seventh century, and that subsequently the bishops\r\norganized the teaching in such a manner that it should be entirely\r\nunder their control. As time went on, however, the schools assumed a\r\nmore public character, although the actual teaching was still carried\r\non in the cloisters and church edifices. It is well known, furthermore,\r\nthat the chief of the Ostrogoths, Visigoths and Lombards--the so-called\r\nBarbarians, who at that time occupied these parts of Europe as\r\nconquerors--showed themselves on many an occasion to be the enlightened\r\nprotectors of public instruction and the enthusiastic admirers of\r\nclassical literature and science.\r\n\r\n   At Milan there is preserved a manuscript which furnishes\r\n   satisfactory proof that the writings of Hippocrates and Galen\r\n   were made the subject of public teaching at Ravenna toward\r\n   the end of the eighth century of the present era.... And the\r\n   transcribing of medical manuscripts was known to be carried\r\n   on at the Monastery of St. Gall, in Switzerland, during the\r\n   eighth century.... It is plain, therefore, that throughout\r\n   those extensive regions which previously had formed a part of\r\n   the Roman Empire, but which during the Middle Ages were under\r\n   the dominion of Barbarian kings, there was never an entire lack\r\n   of physicians, or of medical knowledge, or of facilities for\r\n   teaching medicine. (Daremberg.)\r\n\r\nIn the light of these statements it is easy to believe that the\r\noriginal development of the Medical School at Salerno was a perfectly\r\nnatural event like that of the founding of any of the medical\r\nschools of a more recent date. The remarkably healthy and singularly\r\nattractive character of the spot where the town of Salerno is located;\r\nthe proximity of mineral springs; the comparatively short distance\r\nwhich separated it from such important centres of population as\r\nNaples and the cities of the Island of Sicily, and from the famous\r\nBenedictine Monasteries at La Cava, Beneventum and Monte Cassino; and\r\nthe circumstance that a Ducal Court was established there--all these\r\nare facts which amply explain both why a medical school was founded\r\nhere rather than at some other spot, and why physicians of exceptional\r\nability were easily induced to make the place their home. At no time\r\nin the history of the school, it is important to state, do the church\r\nauthorities appear to have been in control of its affairs. At most,\r\none or two of the monks seem to have taken part in the teaching for\r\nlimited periods of time; but in its main characteristics the school\r\nmay truthfully be described as an institution created and managed\r\nby physicians for the advancement of medical science and the best\r\ninterests of the profession as a whole.[52]\r\n\r\nThe organization of hospitals and their utilization for purposes of\r\nclinical instruction must have been the most important events which\r\nfollowed next in order. It is only upon this assumption that we can\r\nsatisfactorily explain why, for many years in succession, physicians\r\ntraveled all the way from France, Germany and England to Salerno. They\r\nwere eager to gain additional knowledge of medicine, and clinical\r\ninstruction afforded the only sure way of obtaining it; but instruction\r\nof this kind was nowhere else to be obtained at that remote period, and\r\nconsequently men of this earnest and ambitious stamp were compelled to\r\nmake the long journey and to incur the expense and the risk incident to\r\nsuch a trip. As a further evidence of the value which the physicians of\r\nthe later Middle Ages set upon the writings of the teachers at Salerno,\r\nthe fact deserves to be mentioned that, toward the end of the twelfth\r\ncentury and all through the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, these\r\nworks were frequently quoted.\r\n\r\nBut the ability and learning of the Salerno physicians were highly\r\nappreciated by the public at large as well as by their confrères in\r\nother lands; for many people of wealth and of high social standing\r\nvisited Salerno for the purpose of consulting them. Among the number\r\nwere Adalberon, Bishop of Verdun, France, who journeyed thither in 984\r\nA. D., but failed to obtain the relief which he required; Desiderius,\r\nthe Abbot of Monte Cassino; Bohemund, the son of Duke Robert Guiscard;\r\nand William the Conqueror, afterward King of England. The two last\r\nnamed remained for some time in Salerno, in order to secure needed\r\ntreatment for the wounds which they had received in battle.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the tenth, or at the beginning of the eleventh,\r\ncentury the teaching of medicine at Salerno began to assume the\r\ncharacter of regularly organized work. The names of the men and women\r\nwho conducted it--for there were women as well as men in the corps of\r\nteachers--are mentioned in various contemporaneous documents which have\r\ncome down to our time. They are as follows: Petroncellus, Gariopuntus,\r\nAlphanus, Bartholomaeus, Cophon, Trotula, John and Matthew Platearius,\r\nAbella, Mercuriade, Costanza Calenda, Rebecca Guarna, Afflacius,\r\nMaurus, Musandinus and many others. According to Puschmann, the list\r\nof physicians who, during the existence of the Medical School at\r\nSalerno,--a period of nearly one thousand years,--acted as teachers\r\nin the institution, comprised no less than 340 names. The presence\r\nof several women among the instructors of this school, and the great\r\nesteem in which they were held by the men of that time, both for their\r\nability as practitioners and for the excellence of the treatises which\r\nthey wrote, furnish strong confirmation of the statement which Plato\r\nmakes in his work entitled “The Republic,” and which I have already\r\nquoted in one of the earlier chapters, viz.: “For women have as\r\npronounced an aptitude as men for the profession of medicine.” And, if\r\nfurther evidence of the correctness of Plato’s opinion were needed, the\r\nsuccess attained by women physicians during the past thirty or forty\r\nyears in the United States of America might be cited.\r\n\r\nTo the general statement made above I may with advantage add a few\r\ndetails regarding both the individual physicians at Salerno and the\r\nbooks which they wrote. During recent years, thanks to the researches\r\nof Henschel, de Renzi and Piero Giacosa, our knowledge of these matters\r\nhas been greatly enlarged. In 1837 Henschel found, in the library\r\nat Breslau, Germany, a manuscript collection of Salerno medical\r\ntreatises (“Compendium Salernitanum”) dating back as far as the latter\r\npart of the twelfth century of the present era. De Renzi, working\r\nin association with Daremberg and Baudry de Balzac, succeeded in\r\ncollecting from the different libraries of Italy quite a large number\r\nof additional Salerno treatises, all of which have since been published\r\nunder the title “_Collectio Salernitana, ossia documenti inediti e\r\ntrattati di medicina appartenenti alla scuola medica Salernitana_”\r\n(5 vols., Naples, 1852–1859). Finally, Piero Giacosa has added to this\r\nstock of Salerno writings by the publication (Turin, 1901) of a work\r\nwhich bears the title “_Magistri Salernitani nondum editi etc._”\r\nBeside the treatises to be found in these three collections there is\r\none other which, according to Neuburger, contributed more than all the\r\nothers combined to the fame of the Medical School of Salerno. The title\r\nof this extraordinary work is: “_Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum_.”\r\n\r\nThe Salernian writings, it appears, may readily be divided into two\r\ngroups--those of the earlier and those of the later epoch of this\r\nfamous school. The treatises which belong to the older epoch are\r\nwritten in the degraded Latin of the Middle Ages, and seem to have\r\nbeen composed entirely for didactic purposes. In the main they are\r\ncompilations of still earlier Graeco-Latin works, but here and there,\r\nespecially in the parts which relate to therapeutics, evidences of a\r\ncertain measure of originality are discoverable. The pathology adopted\r\nshows a hodge-podge of the humoral doctrine and that of the Methodists.\r\n\r\nThe chief representative of this early epoch is Gariopontus (first\r\nhalf of the eleventh century), whose treatise on special pathology\r\nand therapeutics--entitled “_Passionarius_”--was very popular\r\nfor a long period of years. Next in order comes Petroncellus, whose\r\n“_Practica_” calls for no special comment. Of the works of\r\nAlphanus, John Platearius (the elder) and Cophon (the elder), we\r\npossess only fragments. Trotula, who lived about 1059 A. D. and was\r\nbelieved to be the wife of John Platearius I., attained greater\r\ncelebrity than any of those just mentioned. She was related to Roger\r\nI., Count of Sicily, and was therefore probably of Norman extraction,\r\nand she was considered by her contemporaries to be very learned\r\n(“_sapiens matrona_”).[53] Her writings, which are quite numerous,\r\nare frequently quoted by later authors, this being especially true of\r\nher work on diseases of women. The four other women who took an active\r\nand creditable part in the work of the Salerno Medical School also\r\nwrote treatises on various subjects: Abella, on “Black Bile”, (written\r\nin verse); Mercuriade, on “Pestilential Fever,” and also on “The\r\nTreatment of Wounds”; and Rebecca Guarna, on “Fevers.” In the case of\r\nCostanza Calenda, the daughter of the Dean of the medical school and\r\na woman remarkable for her wisdom as well as for her great beauty, no\r\nrecord of the treatises which she wrote appears to have been preserved.\r\n\r\nThe later epoch of the literature created by the Medical School of\r\nSalerno begins about the year 1100 of the present era, after the Latin\r\ntranslations and compilations made by Constantinus the African had\r\ntaught the physicians who were then at the head of affairs something\r\nabout the medicine of the Arabs, and had, at the same time, through\r\nthe latter medium, brought to their attention afresh the teachings\r\nand practice of the ancient Greeks.[54] Among the works of the latter\r\ncharacter--works which in their Latin dress proved most valuable to the\r\nSalerno physicians--are the following: “The Aphorisms of Hippocrates”;\r\n“Galen’s _Ars Parva_” (_Mikrotechne_); and the same author’s\r\n“Commentaries on the Hippocratic Writings.”\r\n\r\nJohn Afflacius, a monk who lived during the latter half of the eleventh\r\ncentury of the present era, was one of the pupils of Constantinus. His\r\ntreatise “On Fevers,” according to Neuburger, contains ample evidence\r\nof the author’s ability as a clinical observer.\r\n\r\nSomething still remains to be said concerning Bartholomaeus, Cophon\r\nthe Younger, John Platearius the Younger and Archimathaeus. They\r\nhave already been mentioned in the list of authors whose writings\r\ncontributed materially to the celebrity of the Medical School of\r\nSalerno, and it is now only necessary to furnish a few particulars\r\nwith regard to their lives and the nature of the work which they\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nBartholomaeus wrote a treatise (entitled “_Practica_”) on the\r\npractice of medicine as taught by Hippocrates, Galen, Constantinus and\r\nthe Greek physicians. Its enduring popularity is evidenced by the facts\r\nthat it was translated at an early period into several languages and\r\nthat portions of its text are often quoted by later authors. The book\r\ncontains ample evidence that its author was a very close observer and\r\na physician who strove to make accurate diagnoses.\r\n\r\nCophon the Younger (about 1100 A. D.) was the author of two works: a\r\ntreatise on anatomy which bore the title “_Anatomia Porci_,” and\r\none on the practice of medicine (“_Practica_”). The ancients, it\r\nis stated, selected a pig for purposes of anatomical study “because its\r\ninternal organs present a very close resemblance to those of the human\r\nbeing.” Both books are written in a clear and simple style.\r\n\r\nJohn Platearius the Younger was the author of a work on internal\r\nmedicine (“_Practica Brevis_”) and also of one on the subject of\r\nurine (“_Regulae Urinarum_”).\r\n\r\nArchimathaeus wrote and published three treatises: one on “Urines,”\r\nanother on practical medicine (“_Practica_”), and the third\r\non “The Demeanor which a Physician should Observe when he Visits a\r\nSick Person” (“_De Aventu Medici_”). The latter treatise, says\r\nNeuburger, is “a mixture of piety, artlessness, and slyness; but it\r\nfurnishes a capital picture of the carefully regulated behavior of the\r\nmediaeval physician at the patient’s bedside, of the manner in which he\r\nconducted his examination of the case, and of his intercourse with the\r\nhousehold as well as with the sick person.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the treatises referred to above,--treatises which are\r\nknown to have been written by the authors to whom I have credited\r\nthem,--the _Collectio Salernitana_ contains several of which the\r\nauthorship is not known. One of these, which bears the title “_De\r\nAegritudinum Curatione_,” is reputed to furnish a better account\r\nof the special pathology and therapeutics taught at the Medical\r\nSchool of Salerno during the height of its celebrity than is to be\r\nfound in any of the other treatises. In one part of the book--that,\r\nnamely, in which local affections are discussed--the anonymous author\r\ngives in succession the opinions held by the seven leading teachers\r\nof the school (Platearius II., Cophon II., Petronius, Afflacius,\r\nBartholomaeus, Ferrarius and Trotula) with regard to each one of a\r\ncertain number of local diseases; thus enabling the reader to obtain a\r\nvery fair idea of what was the condition of medical science at Salerno\r\nduring the twelfth century of the present era.\r\n\r\nThe famous didactic poem known as the “School of Salerno” (_Schola\r\nSalernitana_) and also as the “Code of Health of the School of\r\nSalerno” (_Regimen Sanitatis Salernitanum_), was composed\r\noriginally about 1100 A. D. It was clearly intended in the first\r\ninstance for the guidance of laymen in matters relating to diet, the\r\nconservation of health and the prevention of disease; but from time to\r\ntime, as the years rolled on, there were added to it several sections\r\nwhich changed materially the character of the poem. From a mere code of\r\nhealth it became eventually a fairly complete cyclopaedia of medicine\r\nin versified form; the number of the verses having increased fully\r\ntenfold during this long period. The poem, in its latest state, is\r\narranged in ten principal sections, as follows: Hygiene (8 chapters);\r\nmateria medica (4 chapters); anatomy (4 chapters); physiology (9\r\nchapters); etiology (3 chapters); significance of different signs (24\r\nchapters); pathology (8 chapters); therapeutics (22 chapters); nosology\r\n(20 chapters); and the practice of medicine as actually experienced (5\r\nchapters).\r\n\r\nThe work has been translated into nearly every modern language, and,\r\naccording to an estimate which was made in 1857, there are in existence\r\nno fewer than 240 different editions. The most recent of these is the\r\nFrench translation made by Meaux Saint-Marc and published by him (2d\r\nedition) in Paris in 1880. There are two English versions--that by\r\nA. Croke (Oxford, 1830), and the more recent one by John Ordronaux\r\n(Philadelphia, 1871).\r\n\r\nSome authorities make the statement that the poem was written\r\noriginally for the guidance of Robert, the son of William the\r\nConqueror; but Neuburger says that the dedication of the work to this\r\nprince is lacking in many of the original manuscript copies and that\r\nin some instances the word “Francorum” is to be found in the place\r\nof “Anglorum”; for which reason he believes that the introduction\r\nof a dedication was made long after the poem had been written. It\r\nwill probably appear strange to most readers that the author of the\r\n“_Regimen Sanitatis_” (or “_Flos Medicinae_,” as it was\r\nsometimes called) should have written his text in the form of verse\r\nrather than in that of prose. He himself states briefly, at the end\r\nof the poem,[55] some of the reasons why he preferred to adopt this\r\ncourse. Rhythm, he maintains, makes it easy to say a great deal in a\r\nfew words; besides which, it facilitates by its novelty the memorizing\r\nof new facts, and also enables one quickly to recall to mind those\r\nwhich have been learned at some previous time. His judgment seems\r\nto have been entirely correct, for the book proved to be immensely\r\npopular, and retained its popularity throughout an extraordinarily long\r\nperiod of time. Furthermore, as already stated, it accomplished a great\r\ndeal toward enhancing the reputation of the Salerno School of Medicine.\r\nWhen we consider how difficult it must have been in those days for\r\nstudents of medicine to memorize facts which were stored in books that\r\nwere very costly and oftentimes not obtainable at any price, we cease\r\nto wonder at the great popularity of this miniature cyclopaedia in\r\nleonine verse.[56] Here were to be found, at one-fourth or one-tenth\r\nthe price of any similar book written in prose, all the essentials\r\n(anatomy, physiology, pathology, etc.) required by the candidate for\r\nmedical honors; and if, perchance, he possessed a good memory, he\r\nmight, without a very great mental effort, transfer the entire poem to\r\nhis own private storehouse of facts.\r\n\r\nA few extracts from this remarkable piece of medical literature are\r\ngiven below, in the belief that many of our readers will find them of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n            ORIGINAL TEXT             DR.

In the\r\n“_Regimen Sanitatis_” only eight lines of text are devoted to\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nIn section IV., which relates to physiology, the text is more\r\ninstructive and entertaining, but still--as compared with the splendid\r\nwork accomplished by Galen--extremely incomplete and superficial.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the twelfth century, Nicolaus Praepositus[57]\r\ncomposed, at the request of his colleagues in the school of Salerno,\r\nan “Antidotarium”--that is, a collection of formulae for combining\r\ntogether, in a single pharmaceutical preparation, various drugs, both\r\nthose commonly employed in that part of Europe and others which were\r\nthen known only to the Arabian physicians. This book of formulae,\r\ncontaining as it did descriptions of the effects which might be\r\nexpected from the different preparations, and furnishing instructions\r\nwith regard to the proper mode of employing them, served its purpose\r\nadmirably, not only in Salerno but throughout Europe, at least\r\nduring the Middle Ages. All the pharmacopoeias of a later date were\r\nbased upon his “Antidotarium,” and indirectly upon the still earlier\r\ncelebrated treatises written by Matthew Platearius and bearing the\r\ntitles “_Glossae_” and “_Circa instans_” (also that of “_De\r\nsimplici medicina_”). The most remarkable item, however, which\r\nis to be found in the Antidotarium is that in which mention is made\r\nof the use of soporific sponges (“_spongia soporifera_”), for\r\nanaesthetizing purposes by means of inhalations, in certain surgical\r\nprocedures. (Neuburger.) They were made by impregnating the sponges\r\nthoroughly with the juices of narcotic plants (opium, hyoscyamus,\r\nmandragora, lactuca, cicuta, etc.), drying them, and putting them aside\r\nuntil they were actually needed. Then the sponge was saturated for\r\nabout an hour with hot water or steamed, after which it was applied\r\nover the patient’s nostrils and held there until the inhalation of the\r\nfumes had induced sleep.\r\n\r\nAnother Salernian treatise worth mentioning is that written by Peter\r\nMusandinus, under the title “On Foods and Beverages suitable for\r\nPersons affected with a Fever.” This writer, who was one of the\r\nteachers at the school of Salerno about the middle of the twelfth\r\ncentury, says that great attention was paid in his time to the\r\npreparation of foods in such a manner as to tempt the appetite of\r\npeople who were ill. He speaks of a meat extract which is prepared\r\nfrom the flesh of the chicken, and also recommends that a soup\r\nmade by boiling a fowl in rose water be given to patients who are\r\naffected with diarrhoea. He even goes so far as to lay stress upon\r\nthe importance of serving food to a sick person in dishes which are\r\npleasing to the eye. Apropos of the subject of foods that are easily\r\ndigestible and therefore suitable for invalids I may mention how Meaux\r\nSaint-Marc translates or interprets the line in the “Regimen Sanitatis\r\nSalernitanum” which reads _O fluvialis anas, quanta dulcedine\r\nmanas!_ His version may be rendered into English thus:\r\n\r\n“Oh wood-duck, how gently doth thy soft flesh glide over the internal\r\nsurface of the stomach!”\r\n\r\nToward the end of the twelfth century (1180 A. D.) there was published\r\nat Salerno a work on surgery--the oldest treatise on this subject\r\nthat is known to have been written in Italy during the Middle Ages.\r\nIt is now called “Roger’s Practice of Surgery,” but originally it was\r\nspoken of (in accordance with a custom quite common in those days) as\r\n“_Post mundi fabricam_,” which are the first three words of the\r\ntext. This book is of a very practical character and is written in a\r\nsimple, straightforward style. While it contains the usual amount of\r\ntraditional knowledge about surgical matters, it gives at the same time\r\nthe results of the personal experience of Roger, of his teachers, and\r\nof his associates. As published in the “_Collectio Salernitana_”\r\nthe work represents, not the treatise as it was originally written,\r\nbut a revision made by Rolando of Parma. It is divided into four\r\nparts or books, the topics treated in which comprise most of those\r\nusually discussed in works on surgery. Under the heading “Wounds of\r\nthe Intestine,” in Book III., there occurs this most remarkable piece\r\nof advice, viz., “to insert into the intestinal canal a small tubular\r\npiece of elder and then to stitch the raw edges of the bowel together\r\nover it.”\r\n\r\nAnother treatise on surgery, entitled “_Chirurgia Jamati_,”\r\nwas published at Salerno before the end of the twelfth century. Its\r\nauthorship is attributed to Jamerius, and in many respects it resembles\r\nclosely the treatise of Roger.\r\n\r\nThe “_Regimen Sanitatis_” was not, it appears, the only treatise\r\non medicine which was published at that period in the form of a poem.\r\nGilles de Corbeil (Petrus Aegidius Corboliensis), who had received\r\nhis professional training at the school of Salerno and was afterward\r\nappointed the personal physician of King Philip Augustus in Paris\r\n(1180–1223 A. D.), wrote versified treatises on these two groups of\r\ntopics--“The pulse, the urine, and the beneficial characteristics of\r\ncomposite remedies,” and “The signs and symptoms of the different\r\nmaladies.” Both of these treatises were received everywhere throughout\r\nEurope with great favor and they maintained their popularity for a\r\nperiod of over four centuries. A French translation (by C. Vieillard)\r\nof the treatise on urology was published in Paris in 1903. An edition\r\nof the “_De signis et symptomatibus aegritudinum_” was printed in\r\nLeipzig in 1907. The following five lines are quoted by Neuburger; and\r\nthey certainly display the remarkable gift possessed by Aegidius for\r\ncondensing a large amount of information into a very small space:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                        DE CONDITIONIBUS URINAE\r\n\r\n    _Quale, quid, aut quid in hoc, quantum, quotiens, ubi, quando,_\r\n    _Aetas, natura, sexus, labor, ira, diaeta,_\r\n    _Cura, fames, motus, lavacrum, cibus, unctio, potus,_\r\n    _Debent artifici certa ratione notari,_\r\n    _Si cupit urinae judex consultus haberi._\r\n\r\nTo translate this into easily comprehensible English prose would\r\ncertainly require the employment of at least five times as many words.\r\n\r\nAnother physician who received a part of his training at Salerno and\r\nwho is mentioned by Neuburger as “The greatest eye surgeon of the\r\nMiddle Ages,” is Benevenutus Grapheus (twelfth century), a native of\r\nJerusalem, and probably of Jewish parentage. He wrote a practical\r\ntreatise (“_Practica oculorum_”) which had a wide circulation, and\r\nwhich has been translated into Provençal, French and English.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the thirteenth century the famous Medical School\r\nof Salerno began to show signs of decadence. Various circumstances\r\nwere responsible for this change. In the first place, its career of\r\ngreat usefulness had already covered a period of about seven hundred\r\nyears, and--according to the law affecting all things human--its\r\ntime of decrepitude was already more than due. Then, in the next\r\nplace, vigorous rivals were beginning to appear in different parts\r\nof Europe,--at Bologna, at Montpellier and at Paris,--and these new\r\nschools must have attracted large numbers of students who otherwise\r\nwould have frequented the University of Salerno for the educational\r\nfacilities which they required. Commercialism--if such a term may be\r\nemployed to characterize the action of those who were not willing\r\nto undergo the entire course of training required for obtaining the\r\nfull privileges belonging to a physician--may perhaps also be named\r\nas one of the influences which contributed to the slow breaking up of\r\nthe school. That this force had already begun to exert some effect\r\nupon the management of the institution may be inferred from the fact\r\nthat in 1140 A. D., Roger, King of Sicily and Naples, promulgated\r\nthe law that nobody would be permitted to practice medicine in his\r\nkingdom until he should have satisfied the royal authorities that he\r\nwas properly qualified to undertake such practice. The establishment\r\nof such a law surely indicated that the number of those who were\r\nincompetent to assume the responsibilities of a practitioner of\r\nmedicine was alarmingly on the increase; and, after it had gone into\r\neffect, many must have been deterred from choosing a medical career,\r\nand perhaps others have been diverted to schools which were located\r\nin countries where the laws were more lax. In 1240 A. D. the Roman\r\nEmperor Frederic II., who was also King of Sicily, made it a law that\r\nthe course of medical studies at Salerno should cover a period of\r\nfive years. All these factors taken together would seem to have been\r\nsufficient slowly to diminish the popularity of this celebrated school.\r\nBut to these there were added, in the latter half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury,--if we may believe Puschmann,--two new factors, which exerted\r\na powerful influence in destroying all hope of further regeneration,\r\nviz., the establishment of a university at Naples, in 1258 A. D., by\r\nManfred, King of Sicily, and the narrow and illiberal spirit in which\r\nthe Church, by this time in almost full control of the education at\r\nSalerno, managed the medical school.\r\n\r\nDuring the following four centuries the University of Salerno--for\r\nduring the thirteenth century it became a university in fact, if not\r\nin name--retrograded steadily, until finally the French Government, on\r\nNovember 29, 1811, officially put an end to its existence. The traveler\r\nwho to-day visits Salerno, in the hope of seeing some remains of the\r\noldest medical school in Europe, will find there only a collection of\r\nsqualid buildings which serve as dwellings for the poorer classes, a\r\ndirty and uncomfortable inn, and shops of nearly the same dimensions\r\nas those which once lined the narrow streets of Pompeii. As he gazes,\r\nhowever, at the superb view presented by the Gulf of Salerno he may\r\nreadily, by an effort of the imagination, reconstruct the picture of\r\nthe famous “Hippocratic City” as it was when William the Conqueror and\r\nother distinguished persons visited it nearly a thousand years ago.\r\n\r\nNeuburger, in his review of the career of the Salerno Medical School,\r\nsums up its contributions to the science of medicine in about these\r\nterms: Those who taught at Salerno were the first physicians in the\r\nChristian part of Western Europe who procured for medicine a home in\r\nwhich scientific considerations alone prevailed, where the Church\r\nexercised no control whatever, and where all the different branches of\r\nthe science were favored to an equal degree. They devoted their best\r\nenergies, by oral teaching and by their writings, to the single object\r\nof communicating practical knowledge of the healing art to all who\r\ndesired to obtain it; and, by the admirable example of their own lives,\r\nthey furnished a high standard for the guidance of those who wished to\r\nreflect honor upon the name of physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n     EARLY EVIDENCES OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE RENAISSANCE UPON THE\r\n                PROGRESS OF MEDICINE IN WESTERN EUROPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters we have seen how the Arabs, inspired with an\r\nextraordinary zeal for acquiring knowledge of the different sciences,\r\ndevoted time and money freely, throughout a period of several\r\ncenturies, to the accomplishment of this purpose. They were fired\r\nwith ambition to become a great nation, and their studies of the\r\nworld’s history taught them that the ancient Greeks had accumulated\r\nin their literature vast stores of the very knowledge which they were\r\nso anxious to acquire. Accordingly all their energies were directed\r\ntoward converting these stores from the Greek into their own language,\r\nthe Arabic. This widespread eagerness of the nation, at a given period\r\nof its history, to improve itself intellectually is spoken of as the\r\nArabic Renaissance, and, at the time which I am now about to consider,\r\nthe movement had practically come to a standstill. A short time,\r\nhowever, before this occurred, the physicians of Italy and of the more\r\nnortherly countries of Western Europe began to show a similar desire\r\nto add to their medical literature; and their first step, like that\r\nof the Arabs four or five centuries earlier, was directed to the work\r\nof translating Arabic medical treatises into debased Latin, which was\r\nthe language commonly employed by the learned during the Middle Ages.\r\nThe knowledge which they desired to acquire could not at that time be\r\nobtained in any other way, for nobody was acquainted with the Greek\r\nlanguage, and, besides, Greek originals had not yet been brought into\r\nWestern Europe. These first evidences of the Renaissance in that part\r\nof the world were not confined to physicians; they were to be found\r\nin every walk of life. The development of the movement reminds one of\r\nwhat takes place near the sea coast, where a period of heat and calm is\r\nsuddenly broken by the appearance of a few gentle puffs of wind, which\r\nare quickly succeeded by the full force of a steady and refreshing\r\nsea-breeze. In like manner feeble indications of the coming movement\r\nappeared in Italy, France, Germany and even England, and these were\r\nsoon followed by unmistakable evidences that a genuine Renaissance of\r\nwidespread proportions had begun. It was as if a great awakening had\r\ntaken place among the nations which had for centuries lain dormant;\r\nan awakening which was followed by a desire to lay aside the trivial\r\npursuits in which they had so far been engaged, and to attain those\r\nresults which were, later on, to excite the wonder and admiration\r\nof the world. Such were, for example, the development of the art of\r\nprinting with movable types; the discovery of America; the production\r\nof such clever painters, sculptors, engravers, workers in metal,\r\netc., as Michael Angelo, Raphael, Albrecht Dürer, Benvenuto Cellini,\r\nRembrandt, and literally scores of others of nearly equal merit; the\r\ndevelopment of a Shakespeare, a Milton and a Dante in the field of\r\nliterature; the production of a Luther, a man who had the courage to\r\nprotest against evil practices which had crept into the Christian\r\nchurch. And medicine, as I have already stated, felt the influence\r\nof the approaching Renaissance, and responded to it by efforts which\r\nhad for their object the acquisition of such knowledge as might be\r\nfurnished by translations from Arabic treatises. Constantinus, the\r\nAfrican, of whom mention has been made on a previous page, seems to\r\nhave been the first person (toward the end of the eleventh century) who\r\ndid any work of this kind; but his associates in Salerno do not appear\r\nto have valued these translations very highly, or else, perhaps, they\r\nwere not yet prepared to give serious consideration to works which were\r\nnew to them. In the twelfth century, as will now be seen, the attitude\r\nof the physicians of Western Europe underwent a change.\r\n\r\nThe city of Toledo, in Spain, was richly stocked with the manuscript\r\ntreasures of Arabic literature at the time (1085 A. D.) when it fell\r\ninto the hands of the Christians. One of the earliest scholars to\r\nengage in the work of translating these treasures into Latin was\r\nGerard of Cremona, in Lombardy, who lived during the twelfth century\r\n(1114–1187 A. D.). He spent most of his lifetime in Toledo, “learning\r\nand teaching, reading and translating.” (Neuburger.) Among the medical\r\nworks which he translated from the Arabic the most important are the\r\nfollowing: Several of the writings of Hippocrates and Galen; the\r\nBreviarium of Serapion; several of the writings of Rhazes and of Isaac\r\nJudaeus; the treatise on surgery by Abulcasis; the Canon of Avicenna,\r\netc. This stimulated many others to follow in the footsteps of Gerard\r\nof Cremona; and thus, during the thirteenth century, a number of works\r\nof importance were translated in addition to those already mentioned.\r\nSuch, for example, were the “Colliget” of Averroes by Bonacosa, a Jew\r\n(1255) of Padua; the “_Teïssir_” of Avenzoar, and the “Dietetics”\r\nof Maimonides by John of Capua, a Jewish convert to Christianity\r\n(1262–1278); the “_De veribus cordis_” of Avicenna by Arnaldus\r\nof Villanova (about 1282); the treatise “_De simplicibus_” of\r\nSerapion the Younger, and the “_Liber servitoris_” of Abulcasis,\r\nby Simon Januensis; and many others. This wave of keen interest in\r\nthe writings of Arabic physicians and in the Arabic versions of Greek\r\nmedical authors soon reached Languedoc in France, and then passed over\r\nfrom there into Italy. For a long time the Salerno physicians resisted\r\nits influence, but they finally yielded to it, as the leaders in the\r\nschools of Bologna, Naples, Montpellier and Paris had already done.\r\nIt was at Palermo, in Sicily, however, that the movement received its\r\ngreatest impetus. Frederick II., at that time King of Sicily, and a\r\nruler who was most tolerant in religious matters, had at his Court an\r\nentire staff of Arabic physicians, philosophers, astrologers and poets;\r\nand, in addition, he kept a number of learned Christians and Jews\r\nconstantly busy translating Arabic works into Latin. The most widely\r\nknown member of the latter group was Michael Scotus (or Scottus),\r\nwho at one time had been a teacher in the Medical School of Salerno.\r\nAmong the books which he translated while he was at Palermo there were\r\nseveral of Aristotle’s treatises, more particularly those which dealt\r\nwith psychological topics and with natural history. Frederick not\r\nonly did everything in his power to promote the work of translating,\r\nhe also took pains to distribute copies of the Latin versions, when\r\ncompleted, among the universities of Western Europe. His son, Manfred,\r\nwho succeeded him on the throne, seems to have been almost as much\r\ninterested in the work as his father had been. It was from him, for\r\nexample, that the University of Paris received a set of the Aristotle\r\nvolumes in Latin. When Charles I., King of Naples (1265–1285 A. D.),\r\nconquered Sicily he manifested considerable interest in continuing the\r\nwork of his predecessors, particularly as regards treatises relating\r\nto medicine. Among the translators whom he employed for this work\r\nwas Farragut (in Arabic, Faradsch ben Salem), from Girgenti, a small\r\ntown on the south coast of Sicily, about sixty miles from Palermo. In\r\naddition to several treatises of minor importance he translated into\r\nLatin the colossal work of Rhazes--the “Continens.” Charles I. kept at\r\nhis Court not only expert translators, but also skilled illuminators;\r\nand it was by them that the celebrated manuscript copy of this work\r\nwhich is to-day in the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ at Paris, was\r\nillustrated with miniatures, three of which are portraits of Farragut.\r\nThis particular copy of the “Continens” was completed in 1282 A. D.\r\nNot a few of the translations made during this period, it should be\r\nstated, are now very difficult to understand. In the first, place, the\r\nLatin in which they are written is of the barbaric type (neo-Latin),\r\nsomething quite different from that employed by Cicero, Tacitus and\r\nother Roman authors of the classical period; and, in the next, it is\r\nnot infrequently evident that the translator himself did not clearly\r\napprehend the meaning of the original Arabic text. Despite all these\r\ndrawbacks, however, the placing of Latin versions of Arabic writings\r\nwithin the reach of European physicians accomplished much good. Even\r\nthe imperfections to which reference has just been made probably\r\nserved to increase the eagerness of these men to gain access to the\r\nreal sources of Arabic learning--viz., the writings in the original\r\nGreek. To anticipate a little, I may say here that this object was\r\nnot attained until after the lapse of about two more centuries--that\r\nis, not until the scholars of Western Europe had learned to read the\r\nGreek, and had also brought out from their hiding places in churches\r\nand monasteries of the East the needed originals. At that period of the\r\nworld’s history centuries corresponded to decades as modern events are\r\nrecorded.\r\n\r\nOne may gain some idea of the extent to which these Latin translations\r\nof Arabic original treatises and of Arabic versions of Greek medical\r\nworks influenced the physicians of Western Europe, by consulting one\r\nof the important medical treatises of the fourteenth century--that,\r\nfor example, of Guy de Chauliac (written 1363 A. D.). Edouard Nicaise,\r\nthe accomplished editor of this and several other mediaeval medical\r\ntreatises, has printed in his preface Joubert’s table showing just how\r\noften Guy quotes each one of about four score earlier authors, and from\r\nthis analysis it appears that Abulcasis was quoted 175 times, Aristotle\r\n62 times, Avicenna 661 times, Galen 890 times, Haly Abbas 149 times,\r\nMesué 61 times, Hippocrates 120 times, and Rhazes 161 times; or, to\r\nstate the facts somewhat differently, the quotations from treatises\r\nintroduced into Western Europe by the Arabs represent, in the present\r\ninstance, 70 per cent of all the quotations (2279 of a total of 3243)\r\nmade by this author. Another equally strong piece of evidence is that\r\nafforded by Vincent de Beauvais’ encyclopaedia,--a work published\r\nin Paris toward the middle of the thirteenth century,--in which the\r\nparts relating to medicine appear to have been taken very largely from\r\ntreatises written by Arabic authors. (See statement on page 270.) There\r\ncan therefore be no reasonable doubt that the Arabs played a most\r\nimportant part in the renaissance of medical learning which began a\r\ncentury or two earlier, which already in the thirteenth century had\r\nmade great progress, and which very soon--as time is reckoned in the\r\ncalendar of all important world movements--was to culminate in that\r\nstill greater renaissance called “modern medicine.”\r\n\r\nDuring the later portion of the Middle Ages (thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies) there were four universities which possessed medical schools\r\nof considerable importance--viz., those of Bologna and Padua in Italy,\r\nand those of Montpellier and Paris in France. All of these seats of\r\nlearning, like the famous school at Salerno, developed so gradually\r\nand from such modest beginnings that it is scarcely possible to assign\r\nto any of them a date of origin. Medicine was taught at several other\r\nplaces--as, for instance, at Oxford, England; at Naples, Vicenza,\r\nSiena, Rome, Florence, Ferrara, Pisa and Pavia, in Italy; at Salamanca\r\nand Lerida, in Spain; at Prague, in Bohemia; at Cologne, in Germany;\r\nat Vienna, in Austria, etc. But the part which these smaller schools\r\nplayed in the work of advancing our knowledge of medicine was certainly\r\nof far less importance than that which fell to the lot of the four\r\ninstitutions just mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe University of Montpellier, if not the oldest of the four schools\r\nmentioned, was apparently the first to attain some degree of\r\ncelebrity. It is known, for example, that the Archbishop of Lyons,\r\nwho was suffering at the time from some malady which the physicians\r\nof that city were not able to cure, visited Montpellier 1153 A. D.\r\nin the belief that he might there obtain the desired relief. John of\r\nSalisbury, who lived during the latter half of the twelfth century and\r\nwho was considered one of the greatest scholars of his time, declared\r\nthat those who wished to acquire a satisfactory knowledge of medicine,\r\nfound that Salerno and Montpellier were the only places where the\r\ndesired instruction might be obtained. Gilles de Corbeil (mentioned\r\nin the last chapter), Von der Aue, and other eminent men of the same\r\nperiod spoke in equally favorable terms of the merits of Montpellier.\r\nThe celebrated monk, Caesarius of Heisterbach, calls the university of\r\nthat city “the headquarters of medical wisdom”; but at the same time\r\nhe expresses regret that the physicians of that school not only do not\r\nbelieve in miraculous cures, but speak of them ironically. It was one\r\nof the characteristics of the institution that the teachers, both the\r\nmedical and the philosophical, were, at a very early period, allowed\r\ngreat freedom of thought and speech; but, as time went on, this liberty\r\nbecame very much curtailed. During the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies there were, it appears, many Jews among the students at\r\nMontpellier, not merely in the department of medicine, but also in the\r\nother departments of the university.\r\n\r\nThe medical schools of Salerno and Montpellier seemed, at this early\r\nperiod (thirteenth century), to possess more individuality than did the\r\nsimilar organizations at Bologna, Padua and Paris; for limited periods\r\nof time each of them in turn enjoyed a certain amount of fame by\r\nreason of the fact that some teacher or writer of special distinction\r\nhappened then to be officially connected with the school. In other\r\nwords, it was the fame of the man and not of the school, that induced\r\nstudents to visit Bologna or Padua, or Paris, during the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries. At a somewhat later period (fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries) all three of these institutions stood out\r\nprominently before the world as celebrated medical schools, with\r\ndistinctive characteristics. To be invited to occupy a chair in one of\r\nthese institutions conferred honorable distinction upon the incumbent\r\nselected, and when I reach that period, farther on in this history,\r\nI shall describe each one of the more important schools separately.\r\nIn dealing with the earlier epoch, however, it seems best to devote\r\nour attention more particularly to individual physicians than to the\r\nschools with which they may happen to be connected.\r\n\r\nAmong the physicians belonging to the latter half of the thirteenth and\r\nthe first quarter of the fourteenth century there is one whose proper\r\nplace in the history of medicine is by no means easy to determine, and\r\nwho yet played a part of no small importance. This man was Pietro\r\nd’Abano, or Petrus Aponensis, who was born at Abano, a small village\r\nnear Padua, 1250 A. D. Very little is known about his early youth,\r\nbut from this little we are warranted in drawing the conclusion that\r\nhis father, a notary, must have taken great pains to afford him every\r\npossible educational advantage. He gave his son, for example, the\r\nopportunity of studying Greek in Constantinople,--a thing of rare\r\noccurrence in those early days,--and allowed him to remain there until\r\nhe had so far mastered the language that he was able to translate the\r\n“_Problemata_” of Aristotle from the original text. Then, upon his\r\nreturn home from Constantinople, he was sent to Paris for the purpose\r\nof perfecting his knowledge of philosophy, mathematics and medicine.\r\nAfter this thorough training for his life work, Pietro d’Abano began\r\nteaching philosophy in Padua, and almost immediately he gained such\r\nsuccess that people spoke of him as “the great Lombard.” However, like\r\nmost of the men of that time who became conspicuous through their\r\nintellectual attainments, Pietro d’Abano was soon accused by the\r\nDominicans of being a heretic and of cultivating the magician’s art. He\r\nwas able to parry this blow by making a journey to Rome and obtaining\r\nfrom Pope Boniface VIII. a decree of absolution. About the same\r\ntime he began writing his two great works--the “_Conciliator_”\r\nand the “Commentaries on Aristotle’s _Problemata_.” He did not\r\nbegin to teach medicine at the University of Padua until 1306, when\r\nhe was already fifty-six years of age. But his lectures, reflecting\r\nas they did the depth and extent of his learning and the keenness of\r\nhis powers of analysis, were a source of great astonishment to his\r\ncontemporaries. It is reported by Neuburger, for example, that Gentile\r\nda Foligno, one of the most distinguished professors in the Medical\r\nSchool of Padua, happening to pass near the auditorium while Pietro\r\nd’Abano was delivering his lecture, listened for a short time and then\r\nexclaimed: “_Salve o santo tempio_”--“Hail to this time which has\r\nbrought forth such wonders!” With the increase of Pietro’s fame came\r\nalso a decided increase in the bitterness of the persecution carried\r\non against him by his ecclesiastical foes, largely due perhaps to his\r\nopen and courageous defense of the Averroism which they so much hated.\r\nThere is very little doubt that he would have been burned at the stake\r\nabout this time if the friendly disposition of the Popes and the mighty\r\ninfluence possessed by the city of Padua had not shielded him from this\r\ndanger. In 1314 the newly founded school of Treviso invited Pietro\r\nd’Abano to occupy the Chair of Medicine and Physics, and he accepted;\r\nbut he was taken ill and died during the following year. Shortly before\r\nthe occurrence of this event he was placed on trial for heresy by the\r\nInquisition, and the proceedings were continued even after his death.\r\nIndeed, according to one account of this famous trial, not only was\r\nthe charge sustained, but the prescribed penalty was inflicted either\r\nupon the disinterred corpse or upon an effigy of the condemned man. One\r\ncentury later, the city of Padua erected a permanent memorial in Pietro\r\nd’Abano’s honor.\r\n\r\nThe principal work of this remarkable physician--viz., the\r\n“_Conciliator differentiarium philosophorum et praecipue\r\nmedicorum_”--was first printed at Venice in 1471. (It is said to\r\nbe one of the earliest printed books known.) It was a most popular\r\ntreatise, as is shown by the fact that between the year last mentioned\r\nand 1621 it passed through a number of editions. Of the other treatises\r\nwhich he wrote--some seven or eight in all--it will be sufficient\r\nto mention here that one alone to which reference has already been\r\nmade in the preceding account, viz., the work entitled “_Expositio\r\nproblematum Aristotelis_” (Mantua, 1475, and Paris, 1520).\r\n\r\nAt this early period in the history of the Padua Medical School there\r\nwere one or two other men who attained a considerable degree of\r\ncelebrity for the excellence of the work which they did, either as\r\nauthors or as class-room teachers. A brief account of one of these,\r\nAegidius Corboliensis, has already been given on a preceding page, and\r\nit seems only fair that I should furnish here similar brief accounts of\r\nsome of the others--Gentile da Foligno, Massilio and Galeazzo de St.\r\nSophia, Giacomo and Giovanni de’ Dondi, and Giacomo della Torre, from\r\nForli, all of whom contributed greatly to the steadily increasing fame\r\nof the Padua School of Medicine; but, under the conditions which govern\r\nthe preparation of this brief history, I must reluctantly pass over\r\nthese names in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n      FURTHER PROGRESS OF MEDICINE AND SURGERY IN WESTERN EUROPE\r\n     DURING THE THIRTEENTH, FOURTEENTH AND A PART OF THE FIFTEENTH\r\n                               CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the men who, during the thirteenth century, exerted more or\r\nless influence upon the growth of medical knowledge there are three\r\nwho deserve to receive some consideration at our hands. They were not\r\nphysicians, but yet some of their writings deal with topics which\r\nare closely related to the science of medicine. They are: Albert von\r\nBollstädt, a German who is generally known as Albertus Magnus, one of\r\nthe greatest scholastic philosophers of the Middle Ages; Vincent of\r\nBeauvais (Vincentius Bellovacensis), a French Dominican monk, who was\r\nreader to Louis IX., and who compiled a general encyclopaedia which\r\nbrought him great fame at that period; and Roger Bacon, an Englishman\r\nwho, by reason of the extraordinary extent of his knowledge and his\r\nremarkable powers of observation, was given the name of “Doctor\r\nmirabilis.”\r\n\r\n_Albertus Magnus._--Albertus Magnus was born at Lauingen, Swabia,\r\nin 1193 A. D., obtained his education in Italy (at the University of\r\nPadua, during the latter part of his stay), joined the Order of the\r\nDominicans on arriving at the age of thirty, and afterwards, throughout\r\nhis long life, devoted himself largely to teaching, particularly at\r\nParis and Cologne. He was a prolific writer and his works, particularly\r\nthose which treat of topics belonging to the domain of natural history,\r\nwere greatly appreciated. The effect, however, which they produced\r\nupon a certain class of readers was to persuade them that he was a\r\ngreat magician. The chief distinction of his writings lies in the\r\nfact that they contain a large number of original observations which\r\nhe made during the course of his journeys afoot through Germany in\r\nthe character of Provincial of the Dominican Order. This habit of\r\nexercising entire independence in the use of his reasoning powers\r\nwas something quite rare in those days. His observations were\r\ndirected chiefly to matters belonging to the domains of zoölogy,\r\nbotany, climatology, mineralogy, chemistry and physics. The following\r\nsignificant advice, says Neuburger, is attributed to him: “As regards\r\nthe doctrines which relate to questions of belief and of morality, it\r\nis the part of wisdom to attach greater authority to Saint Augustine\r\nthan to the philosophers; in matters belonging to the domain of\r\nmedicine put your chief trust in Galen and in Hippocrates; in natural\r\nhistory, however, your best guide is Aristotle.” Neuburger adds that,\r\nthroughout the writings of Albertus Magnus, there appear interesting\r\nstatements relating to anatomy, physiology, psychology, and the plants\r\nand minerals which may be used for remedial purposes.\r\n\r\nAn edition of the writings of Albertus Magnus (21 folio volumes) was\r\npublished in Lyons by Petrus Jamy in 1651. The work was republished in\r\nParis in 1892 and following years.\r\n\r\n_Vincent of Beauvais._--Vincent of Beauvais, France, a Dominican\r\nmonk who lived during the first half of the thirteenth century and\r\nwas the tutor of Louis the Ninth’s children, devoted the major part\r\nof his time to literary work. He wrote many theological treatises\r\nand also edited a large encyclopaedia in which information is\r\nfurnished regarding everything that was known at that time. Several\r\nhundred authors aided him in compiling this work, which is entitled\r\n“_Speculum Majus_.” It is arranged in three parts, one of which\r\n(“_Speculum Naturale_”) consists of 33 books that are divided\r\ninto 3740 chapters; and quite a number of the divisions are devoted\r\nto topics relating to medicine. The authors, from whose writings this\r\nmedical information has been abstracted, are Hippocrates, Aristotle,\r\nDioscorides, Haly Abbas, Rhazes, Avicenna and several others--not to\r\nmention the Church Fathers and other encyclopaedic writers connected\r\nwith the Church. The first printed edition of this great work appeared\r\ntoward the end of the fifteenth century (1473–1475 A. D.); the last,\r\nor one of the last, in 1624. Lack of space will not permit me to give\r\nany details concerning the works of a somewhat similar character\r\nwhich were prepared, about the same time, by the English Franciscan\r\nmonk Bartholomaeus of Glanvilla (1260); by the Dominican, Thomas of\r\nCantimpré (1204–1280 A. D.), a pupil of Albertus Magnus; and by others.\r\n\r\n_Roger Bacon._--Roger Bacon was born about 1210 A. D. in\r\nIlchester, Somersetshire, England, and received his early training at\r\nOxford. When he was thirty years of age he went to Paris and, after\r\ndevoting himself assiduously for seven years to the study of various\r\nbranches of learning, he received the Doctor’s degree (1247). The\r\nwish to acquire a thorough knowledge of whatever subject he undertook\r\nto study constituted a prominent feature of his character. He was\r\nfond of languages, but he had an even greater love for mathematics,\r\nparticularly in connection with astronomy, and for experimental work\r\nin the department of chemistry. It is said that he expended a large\r\nsum of money (£2000) upon these chemical investigations. He left\r\nParis in 1250, returned to England, and not long afterward joined the\r\nOrder of the Franciscans. Robert Grossetête, Bishop of Lincoln, and\r\nthe Franciscan monk Adam of Marisco--two men whom Neuburger describes\r\nas theologians of a very liberal type--exercised a strong influence\r\nupon Bacon at this period of his life. They confirmed him in the\r\nbelief that familiarity with the learned languages was an acquisition\r\ngreatly to be prized, and at the same time they gave him every\r\nencouragement to pursue his researches in mathematics and in natural\r\nhistory. For a certain length of time he was an instructor at Oxford,\r\nbut his views with regard to ecclesiastic and moral questions and\r\nthe discoveries which he made in physics (especially in optics) were\r\nbeyond the comprehension of his contemporaries, who did not hesitate to\r\npronounce them works of the Devil and to subject Bacon to all sorts of\r\npunishments and deprivations. Fortunately for him and for the cause of\r\nscience the newly elected Pope, Clement IV. (1266), came to his rescue\r\nin those dark days and granted him--under the promise of absolute\r\nsecrecy--permission to continue his researches without hindrance and to\r\nperfect the plans which he had in mind for reforms of different kinds.\r\nI cannot follow this pioneer of scientific research work, this man who\r\nwas several centuries ahead of the time in which he lived, through all\r\nthe vicissitudes of his interesting and extraordinarily fruitful life;\r\nI may simply add that his death occurred about the year 1294; that\r\nhe left behind him many important treatises, only a small portion of\r\nwhich have thus far been published,[58] and that from these alone one\r\nis justified in classing Roger Bacon as one of the greatest thinkers\r\nwhom history has recorded. So far as is now known, he wrote very little\r\nconcerning medicine, and--strange to say--he seems to have attached\r\nconsiderable importance to astrology; indeed, he went so far as to\r\nblame the physicians of his day for their ignorance regarding this\r\nscience, “as a result of which they neglect the best part of medicine.”\r\nIn strange contrast with these views, which to-day we characterize as\r\nfoolishness, is Bacon’s famous dictum: “Experiment is a firmer and more\r\ntrustworthy basis of knowledge than argument”--a maxim which is the\r\nguiding principle of modern medicine.\r\n\r\nThe Medical School of Bologna.--The Medical School of Bologna first\r\nbegan to assume a certain degree of prominence in the early part of\r\nthe thirteenth century, under the teaching of Thaddeus Alderotti--also\r\nfrequently called Thaddeus of Florence.\r\n\r\n_Thaddeus Alderotti._--Thaddeus Alderotti, who was born at\r\nFlorence, Italy, 1223 A. D., of humble parentage, began the study\r\nof philosophy and medicine at Bologna only after he had reached\r\nmanhood; but he was such an earnest student and made such good use of\r\nhis opportunities that in 1260 he was chosen to serve as one of the\r\nteachers in the school. Throughout a period of many years he filled\r\nthe office so acceptably that his colleagues bestowed upon him the\r\nname of “Master of Physicians.” Before this time arrived, however,\r\nhis lack of funds was sorely felt, for he was obliged, in order to\r\nsupport himself, to offer consecrated wax candles for sale at the\r\nentrance of the church. He is reported to have been not merely a most\r\nlearned physician, but also a very successful practitioner. He was\r\ncalled into consultation from all parts of the country, so highly\r\nwas his opinion valued by other physicians; and thus in due time he\r\naccumulated a large fortune. His charges were by no means small. It is\r\nrelated, for example, that Pope Honorius IV. sent for him to come to\r\nRome, and, after the treatment was completed, paid him a fee of 10,000\r\ngold pieces[59]--but not until after he had expressed surprise that\r\nThaddeus should have charged as much as 100 gold pieces per day for his\r\nservices. To this demurrer on the part of the Pope, Thaddeus replied\r\nthat the petty princes and even the simple nobles made no objection to\r\npaying him 50 or more gold pieces per day. It is scarcely necessary to\r\nadd that the Holy Father did not wish to be outdone by his inferiors.\r\n\r\nAlderotti died 1303 A. D.\r\n\r\nAmong the writings of Thaddeus Alderotti which have come down to our\r\ntime there are to be found a number of autobiographical references\r\nwhich are not without interest. In one place, for example, he mentions\r\nthe fact that he occasionally walks in his sleep, and then proceeds\r\n(in Latin) to discuss the phenomenon of sleep-walking as observed in\r\nhis own case. I give here a free translation of the text printed in\r\nNeuburger’s History:--\r\n\r\n   The fourth question which suggests itself is this: Can the\r\n   senses during sleep come into active operation? Touching this\r\n   fourth question I reason thus: It appears as if, when one\r\n   is asleep, the senses must act, for a person may move about\r\n   without incurring any harm when he is in that state, as is\r\n   often observed in the case of those who, like myself, walk in\r\n   their sleep.... Furthermore, it has been remarked that these\r\n   people are able to harness a horse and then to ride the animal\r\n   safely,--acts which it is not possible to perform without the\r\n   aid of the senses. On the other hand, Aristotle maintains that\r\n   a man, when asleep, is not capable of using his senses. To this\r\n   I reply by conceding that during sleep a man certainly does not\r\n   perceive what is going on about him. Wherefore, if you answer me\r\n   by saying that the mere fact of a man’s ability to walk while\r\n   he is asleep furnishes conclusive evidence that he possesses\r\n   his senses, I reply that movements like that of walking are not\r\n   the result of an impression made upon the mind (“_impressio\r\n   imaginativa_”), but the product of a different mechanism, of\r\n   a nature which permits it to operate during sleep.... As to the\r\n   second point to which you call attention--that, namely, with\r\n   regard to the power of bridling and riding a horse while one is\r\n   asleep--I make this reply: These acts are performed as a result\r\n   of an impression made upon the mind through the working of the\r\n   imagination, and not as a direct consequence of any images\r\n   created upon the eye; for, if the sleep-walker happens to be in\r\n   a strange house when the impulse to walk seizes him, he will not\r\n   go to the stable. The route which he is sure to take will be one\r\n   with which he is familiar, as happened in the case of the blind\r\n   teacher who, unaccompanied by any person, walked habitually\r\n   through the streets of Bologna. And then, besides, I am able to\r\n   speak from personal experience, for in one of my sleep walks I\r\n   jumped down from an elevation about four feet above the ground\r\n   without awaking from my sleep.... When, in the course of one\r\n   of these walks, I am exposed to cold, or when I hear somebody\r\n   speaking near me, I refer these phenomena entirely to something\r\n   within myself, and I return to my bed.\r\n\r\nOf the four medical schools to which a brief reference was made on a\r\npreceding page, that of Bologna was probably the first to attain a\r\ncertain degree of celebrity; and it owed this distinction very largely\r\nto the work done by men who were primarily surgeons, viz.: Hugo of\r\nLucca; Theodoric, Hugo’s son; William of Saliceto; and possibly, to\r\na very slight extent, Roland of Parma, who spent only a part of his\r\nprofessional life in Bologna. But there was one other who, while he was\r\nnot a surgeon, yet contributed very greatly to the fame of the Bologna\r\nschool and at the same time to the real advance in surgical knowledge\r\nwhich characterized the work of the men whose names have just been\r\nmentioned--viz., Mondino. These men, especially Mondino, cultivated\r\nthe study of anatomy much more earnestly than their rivals at Salerno\r\nhad ever done, and the surgical methods which they adopted were of\r\na more scientific character than those practiced by Roger. In the\r\ntreatment of wounds, for example, instead of striving to bring about\r\nhealing by the application of remedies which stimulate suppuration,\r\nthey favored the dry method; in which practice they were justified\r\nnot only by their own experience but also by Galen’s teaching: “A dry\r\nstate of the wound approaches more nearly to what may be considered\r\nthe normal condition, whereas a moist state is surely unhealthy.”\r\n(_Methodi medend._, IV., 5.) As an offset to the latter authority\r\nthe Salerno surgeons quoted that particular aphorism of Hippocrates\r\n(V., 67) which reads: “_Laxa bona, cruda vero mala._”--almost the\r\nvery opposite of Galen’s doctrine. Then again, the Bologna surgeons\r\neffected improvements in other directions: They materially restricted\r\nthe use of the red-hot cautery iron, and they cast aside as useless\r\nmany of the complicated apparatuses which had previously been employed\r\nin the treatment of fractures and dislocations. It is evident from\r\nthese facts that the Bologna surgeons were not, as were most of the\r\nphysicians of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries (Thaddeus of\r\nFlorence perhaps excepted), slavish followers of the ancients or even\r\nof the more modern Arabs, but men who thought independently and who\r\nwere not afraid to use their own powers of observation.\r\n\r\n_Hugo of Lucca._--Hugo Borgognoni, more commonly called Hugo of\r\nLucca--was born in that city about the middle of the twelfth century,\r\nserved as municipal physician to the city of Bologna, accompanied\r\nthe Bolognese Crusaders on their expedition to Syria and Egypt, was\r\npresent at the siege of Damietta in 1219 A. D., and died a short time\r\nbefore 1258, at the age of nearly one hundred. He acquired a great\r\nreputation as a surgeon and brought up several sons who followed in\r\nthe same walk of life, among the number being Theodoric, who gained\r\neven greater celebrity than his father in the domain of surgery. As\r\nHugo himself left no writings of any kind, we are largely dependent,\r\nfor a knowledge of his achievements, on the treatises which his son\r\nTheodoric wrote. From this source we learn that Hugo recommended, for\r\nuse in surgical operations, the employment of narcotizing sponges like\r\nthose described on page 253, and was also an advocate of the plan of\r\ntreating wounds by the dry method (compresses soaked in wine over\r\nwhich simple dressings were applied). In the treatment of empyema, of\r\nabscesses, of penetrating wounds of the chest, and of both complicated\r\nand simple wounds of the skull, he emphasized the wisdom of adopting\r\nsimple measures, of interfering with the parts as little as possible,\r\nof abstaining from the use of the probe, and of observing strict\r\ncleanliness. In cases of fracture of a rib it was his practice to\r\nplace the patient in a bath, and then, with fingers which had been\r\nthoroughly oiled, to attempt the replacement of the separated ends of\r\nthe fractured bone. Neuburger regards Hugo of Lucca as the founder of\r\nthe Bologna School of Surgery.\r\n\r\n_Theodoric of Lucca_, known also as Bishop Theodoric, was born\r\n1206 A. D. While still quite a young man he joined the recently\r\nestablished order of preachers, and not long afterward was appointed\r\nAlmoner (_Poenitentiarius_)[60] to Pope Innocent IV. Eventually\r\nhe became Bishop of Cervia, near Ravenna. By special permission of\r\nthe Pope, he was able to complete the surgical training which he had\r\nreceived from his father, Hugo of Lucca; and thus, while he still held\r\nthe office of Bishop, he practiced surgery to some extent in Bologna.\r\nIn course of time his practice became very extensive and also very\r\nlucrative; as a result of which he was able to leave a large fortune to\r\nvarious charitable institutions. The first printed edition of his work\r\non surgery appeared in Venice in 1498, and was followed by numerous\r\nlater issues.\r\n\r\nTheodoric, says Neuburger, was a most uncompromising advocate of the\r\ndry method of treating wounds. His (Theodoric’s) words are these: “For\r\nit is not necessary--as Roger and Roland have said, as most of their\r\ndisciples teach, and as almost all modern surgeons practice--to favor\r\nthe generation of pus in wounds. This doctrine is a very great error.\r\nTo follow such teaching is simply to put an obstacle in the way of\r\nnature’s efforts, to prolong the diseased action, and to prohibit the\r\nagglutination and final consolidation of the wound.”[61]\r\n\r\nIn his enumeration of the different means that may be employed for\r\narresting hemorrhage, Theodoric mentions cauterization, tamponading,\r\nthe application of a ligature, and the complete division of the injured\r\nblood-vessel. He attached great importance to the proper feeding of the\r\npatient. In Book III., chapter 49, of his treatise on surgery, he gives\r\nminute instructions with regard to the proper manner of employing a\r\nsalve made with quicksilver, and at the same time he mentions the fact\r\nthat he observed a flow of saliva as one of the results of its use.\r\n\r\nThe expressions “healing by first intention” and “healing by second\r\nintention” are encountered for the first time in the writings of\r\nBrunus, a surgeon who practiced in the cities of Verona and Padua about\r\nthe middle of the thirteenth century, and who was a vigorous advocate\r\nof the dry method of treating wounds. His two treatises (“_Chirurgia\r\nmagna_” and “_Chirurgia minor_”) were printed in Venice in\r\n1546. Neuburger says that although a large part of the text in these\r\nvolumes consists of extracts from Galen, Avicenna, Hippocrates,\r\nAbulcasis and other authorities, there are to be found at the same time\r\nnot a few observations of an original character.\r\n\r\n_William of Saliceto._--William of Saliceto (_Guglielmo da\r\nSaliceto_) is accorded by Neuburger the honor of being Bologna’s\r\ngreatest surgeon--if not, indeed, the greatest surgeon of that period.\r\nHe was born in the early part of the thirteenth century and spent a\r\nlarge portion of his professional life in Bologna, where he not only\r\npracticed medicine but also acted in the capacity of a teacher of this\r\nscience. During the latter part of his career he lived in Verona, where\r\nhe held the position of Municipal Physician and Attending Physician of\r\nthe City Hospital. He died about the year 1280.\r\n\r\nSaliceto’s work on surgery is of a thoroughly practical character and\r\nreveals the author to have been a born surgeon.[62] In addition to the\r\n“_Cyrurgia_,” which was first printed in Piacenza 1476 A. D., he\r\nwrote a treatise which bears the title “_Summa conservationis et\r\ncurationis_” (printed first in Piacenza in 1475). The “Surgery”\r\nis divided into five books, preceded by a short chapter on general\r\nmethods, etc. Book I. is devoted to affections of the cranium,\r\neruptions on the head, eye diseases, ear diseases (snaring of ear\r\npolypi), nasal polypi, abscesses in the axilla, affections of the\r\nmammary gland, tumors in different parts of the body, venereal lesions\r\nin the groin, and a long list of other surgical maladies. Book II.\r\ndescribes wounds of all sorts, including those produced by arrows\r\n(with reports of cases), penetrating wounds of the chest and abdomen\r\n(with instructions about sewing both longitudinal and transverse\r\nwounds of the intestine), etc. Under the head of penetrating wounds\r\nof nerves (declared by the author to be very dangerous), Saliceto\r\nrecommends enlargement of the wound, the application of oil, and\r\nthe employment of opium or hyoscyamus to quiet the pain. Book III.\r\ntreats the subject of fractures and dislocations in a most thorough\r\nmanner. Mention is made of the crepitation noise heard in fractures\r\n(_sonitus ossis fracti_) and a warning is given not to apply\r\nthe bandages too tightly and to be careful to change the dressings\r\nevery three or four days. The instructions given with regard to the\r\nreduction of dislocations are said by Neuburger to be most sensible.\r\nBook IV. contains such anatomical descriptions as may be helpful to\r\nthe practical surgeon. From these, however, it is evident that the\r\nwriter had never dissected the human cadaver. Book V. is devoted to\r\nthe subject of cauterizing and to the consideration of those remedial\r\nagents which are commonly employed in surgery. The instruments used\r\nfor cauterizing purposes were made of different metals, gold or silver\r\nbeing preferred for the more delicate ones, and brass and iron for the\r\nothers. Immediately after the cauterization it was customary to apply\r\nbutter, or the fat of some animal, or oil scented with roses, to the\r\nburned part.\r\n\r\nSaliceto’s other treatise--the _Summa conservationis etc._--is\r\nalso divided into five books, which contain chapters devoted to all\r\nthe more important branches of internal medicine and to questions\r\nof diet, of the physician’s behavior in the presence of a patient,\r\netc. Especially interesting are his remarks about the importance of\r\nconsidering the psychological effect produced upon the patient by\r\nsuch matters as the physician’s manner of feeling the pulse, his\r\ncarefulness to inquire about the patient’s various symptoms (how the\r\nnight was passed, what food and drink had been taken, etc.)--an effect\r\nwhich oftentimes is “greater than that produced by instruments and\r\nmedicines.” In discussing the subject of prognosis, Saliceto makes the\r\nremark that it is always proper for the physician to hold out to the\r\npatient hope of recovery, although he urges at the same time the wisdom\r\nof telling the whole truth to the friends of the patient. He also lays\r\ngreat stress upon the importance of “not holding any conversation with\r\nthe lady of the house upon confidential matters.” Neuburger gives a\r\nnumber of other extracts from this most interesting work; but I must\r\nabstain from devoting any more space to this one mediaeval author,\r\nwhose manner of writing makes it difficult to realize that the treatise\r\nwhich he has written belongs to the thirteenth century and not to a\r\nvery recent period.\r\n\r\n_Roland of Parma._--Roland, who was born in the city of Parma\r\nand who spent a part of his life in Bologna, not only edited the work\r\nof his teacher, Roger of Salerno, but also wrote a concise treatise\r\non surgery that is entitled “_Rolandina_.” Neuburger speaks\r\nof this book as differing but little from Roger’s “_Practica\r\nchirurgiae_.”[63] “It contains, however, the report of a case of\r\npenetrating wound of the chest in which Roland showed not a little\r\ncourage by daring to cut off, flush with the skin, a portion of lung\r\ntissue which happened to protrude from the wound, and then applying a\r\nsimple dressing.”\r\n\r\nThe treatise known by the title “_Glossulae quatuor magistrorum super\r\nchirurgiam Rogerii et Rolandi_” was written by an unknown author or\r\nperhaps by several authors. It represents a collection of commentaries\r\non the works of the two who are mentioned in the title of the book, and\r\nshould probably be classed as a part of the literature of the Salerno\r\nSchool of Medicine.\r\n\r\n_Mondino the Anatomist._--Mondino, who was the first physician,\r\nafter an interval of about fifteen hundred years, to revive the\r\npractice of dissecting human bodies, was born at Bologna at about 1275\r\nA. D. He received his professional training at the medical school of\r\nhis native city and was given the degree of Doctor in 1290, at the age\r\nof fifteen(!). Not long afterward he began to teach anatomy in the same\r\ninstitution and continued to serve in this capacity up to the time\r\nof his death in 1326. The physicians who aided him in his anatomical\r\nresearches were Ottone Agenio Lustrulano, his prosector, and a woman\r\nnamed Alessandra Gilliani, from Perriceto.\r\n\r\nMondino’s method of teaching anatomy was to deliver his lectures with\r\nthe dissected cadaver directly before him; that is, he demonstrated\r\nthe correctness of his statements as fast as he made them. (See Fig.\r\n9.) Such a method was entirely new at the time and proved immensely\r\npopular, attracting students to Bologna in large numbers. Partly in\r\nthis way and partly by means of the treatise on anatomy which he wrote\r\n(“_Anatomia Mundini_”), he became the instructor of numerous\r\ngenerations of physicians. His treatise remained the authoritative\r\nguide in anatomy up to the middle of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 9. THE OLDEST KNOWN PICTORIAL REPRESENTATION OF A\r\n  FORMAL DISSECTION OF THE HUMAN BODY.\r\n\r\n  The original, which is in the library of the University of\r\n  Montpellier, France, appears in a manuscript copy of Guy de\r\n  Chauliac’s _Chirurgia magna_ (fourteenth century). Eugen\r\n  Holländer of Berlin, the author of _Die Medizin in der\r\n  klassischen Malerei_, has courteously given permission to\r\n  copy the reproduction. The many defects which appear in this\r\n  picture are due to the fact that the reproduction was taken\r\n  directly from the original miniature, now six hundred years old.\r\n  Holländer gives the following description of this interesting\r\n  scene:\r\n\r\n  “In one of the rooms of the hospital a woman’s dead body is\r\n  lying upon a table. Alongside the bed in which she died a nun\r\n  is praying for her soul. Two physicians are busily engaged in\r\n  the work of dissecting the body. An instructor is reading out\r\n  of a book, for the benefit of the students who are crowding\r\n  into the room, such portions of the text as apply to the case\r\n  in hand, and at the same time he is directing their attention\r\n  to the uterus which one of the dissectors is lifting out of the\r\n  abdominal cavity. Owing to the defective state of the original\r\n  miniature it is not possible to state positively what part the\r\n  three women who stand near the head of the corpse are taking in\r\n  the scene, but it is not unlikely that they too are physicians,\r\n  especially as their presence on such an occasion would be quite\r\n  in harmony with the customs of that period of time.”]\r\n\r\nIn one place in his “Anatomy” Mondino states explicitly that he\r\ndissected two human cadavers in the month of January, 1315. This\r\nstatement renders it possible to fix the exact date when the\r\npractice of making such dissections--which had been carried on for a\r\nconsiderable period of time about 250 B. C.--was first resumed. If\r\none reflects upon the nature of the obstacles which in 1315 stood in\r\nthe way of a revival of this practice,--for example, the deep-seated\r\nprejudice against it entertained by all classes of the community, and\r\nthe very strong opposition of the ecclesiastic authorities to what\r\nthey honestly believed to be a desecration of the human body,--one\r\nwill readily appreciate how great was the courage displayed by Mondino\r\nwhen he almost openly undertook his first dissection. The subsequent\r\ncareer of this famous teacher of anatomy justifies the belief that\r\nhis determination to take the course which he did was based upon\r\nthe profound conviction that the first step toward increasing the\r\nscanty stock of knowledge possessed at that time with regard to the\r\nstructure of the human body in all its parts, must necessarily be one\r\nin continuation of that which Erasistratus and his associates had taken\r\ncenturies earlier, but which had not been succeeded by a sufficient\r\nnumber of other steps in the same direction. The series of discoveries\r\nin anatomy, physiology and pathology which resulted from Mondino’s\r\ncourageous and intelligent act, form a part of the history of modern\r\nmedicine, and do not therefore call for consideration in this place. We\r\nmay simply add that much information of a very interesting character is\r\nfurnished by Neuburger (_op. cit._) with regard to the manner in\r\nwhich Mondino and his immediate successors carried on their instruction\r\nin anatomy from that time forward.\r\n\r\nThe Medical School at Bologna, as may well be imagined, gained great\r\nfame from the possession of such distinguished teachers as those\r\nwhose careers I have briefly sketched--Hugo and Theodoric of Lucca,\r\nWilliam of Saliceto, and Mondino; and it retained a large part of this\r\ncelebrity throughout the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, despite\r\nthe appearance on the scene, toward the end of this time, of several\r\nformidable claimants for high honors in the domain of medical research\r\nand education--viz., the schools at Montpellier and Paris, in France,\r\nand that of Padua, in Italy.\r\n\r\n_Lanfranchi and the Medical School of Paris._--According to\r\nEdouard Nicaise[64] medicine was not taught publicly at Paris\r\npreviously to 1160 A. D. The teaching was carried on at that time\r\nby associations of physicians, and it was only during the following\r\ncentury (about 1250 A. D.) that something like a university was\r\nestablished in that city. Up to the end of the sixteenth century (1595\r\nA. D.), during the reign of Henry IV., this institution remained under\r\nthe control of the Church. Its functions--so far at least as medicine\r\nwas concerned--were limited to the bestowing of degrees, for it\r\npossessed at that time no organization of instructors and no permanent\r\nquarters in which the teaching might be carried on systematically; a\r\nchurch (see Fig. 10) or the Dean’s residence serving as the locality in\r\nwhich the lectures were commonly delivered.\r\n\r\nDuring the middle part of the thirteenth century and for a long\r\ntime afterward, the practice of surgery, which was then of a rather\r\nprimitive type, was entirely in the hands of two classes of men--the\r\nbarbers and the so-called surgeons.[65] As time went on, the surgeons\r\nbegan to feel the necessity of securing better protection for their\r\nmaterial interests, which were being more and more encroached upon by\r\nthe barbers--a class of men who were not privileged by the authorities\r\nto include in their field of activities anything beyond hair-cutting,\r\nshaving, cupping, the extraction of teeth, the application of\r\nleeches, the incision of boils and perhaps one or two other simple\r\noperations. For this reason, therefore, and also probably because\r\nthey too felt in some measure the effects of the Renaissance spirit\r\nwhich was then abroad in the land, they organized themselves (1254\r\nA. D.) into an association which bore the name of “College of Saint\r\nCosmas” (_Collège de St. Côme_).[66] One of the early acts of\r\nthis association was to establish the rule that all applicants for\r\nmembership should pass successfully an examination as to their fitness\r\nbefore they could be admitted. Very little is known about the doings of\r\nthe organization during the early years of its existence. Later, as we\r\nshall see, it played a very important part in the history of medicine\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 10. THE MANNER OF GIVING PUBLIC INSTRUCTION IN\r\n  MEDICINE DURING THE MIDDLE AGES.\r\n\r\n  (From Meaux Saint-Marc’s _L’École de Salerne_.)\r\n\r\n  The present cut is evidently a modern copy of a much earlier\r\n  original.]\r\n\r\nFrom the account given by Nicaise it appears that no regular\r\ninstruction in anatomy was given in the University of Paris until after\r\nthe fourteenth century, and then only from three to five times a year,\r\nwhen the body of a person who had been hung was publicly dissected.\r\n“Such a dissection lasted seven days and was a veritable scientific\r\nfestival.” No official cliniques were held and the only way in which\r\nthe student of medicine could obtain some practical acquaintance with\r\ndisease and with the methods of treatment was by attaching himself to a\r\nphysician or a surgeon, or to a barber.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding brief and very incomplete account the reader will, I\r\ntrust, be able to form some idea of the condition of affairs, medical\r\nand surgical, in Paris at the time when Lanfranchi arrived in that city.\r\n\r\nLanfranchi, says Neuburger, was born in Milan, Italy, and was\r\nundoubtedly the most distinguished among the pupils of Saliceto at\r\nBologna. After leaving the medical school he practiced both medicine\r\nand surgery for a certain length of time in his native city; but\r\nfinally, becoming involved in the quarrels between the Guelphs and\r\nthe Ghibellines, he--like many other Italian physicians--was obliged\r\nto take refuge in France. In Lyons, which was his first place of\r\nresidence, he engaged for a short time in the practice of medicine and\r\nalso wrote his first treatise on surgery--“_Chirurgia Parva_.”\r\nThen, after traveling from one place to another in the provinces, he\r\nfinally (1295 A. D.) settled permanently in Paris. In that city he very\r\nsoon acquired a large practice, and, at the same time, built up for\r\nhimself a great reputation as a teacher of medicine. The _Collège de\r\nSt. Côme_ elected him a member of that organization and profited\r\ngreatly from the fame which his teaching brought to the institution.\r\nIt is said that Jean Passavant, who was at that time the Dean of the\r\nMedical Faculty of Paris, aided Lanfranchi in his work by every means\r\nin his power. As a result Paris, during a considerable period of time,\r\nwas one of the few places in which genuine clinical instruction was\r\ngiven to all those who desired to acquire a practical acquaintance\r\nwith disease. His larger treatise, the “_Chirurgia Magna_,” was\r\ncompleted in 1296. It was dedicated to the King of France, Philip\r\nIV., commonly called “_Phillippe le Bel_,” and its intrinsic\r\nmerits assured him a permanent reputation as a surgeon. This work,\r\nwhich was translated years ago into English and has recently (1894)\r\nbeen published by the “Early English Text Society,” under the title\r\n“Lanfrank’s Science of Cirurgie,” consists of five separate fasciculi\r\nor parts. A few extracts from the text of this celebrated work may\r\nprove of interest to the reader. Not having access to the English\r\nversion just mentioned, I shall have to translate from the version\r\n(partly Latin and partly German) supplied by Neuburger.\r\n\r\nPart I. of the _Chirurgia Parva_ mentions some of the\r\ncharacteristics which a surgeon should possess. He should, for example,\r\nhave well-formed hands, with fingers that are long and slender; his\r\nbody should be strong and firm in its movements; his hands and fingers\r\nshould respond quickly to the workings of the mind; his mind should\r\nbe of a subtle type; in character he should not be over-bold, but\r\nself-reliant and yet modest; he should have a good supply of common\r\nsense; he should be well-informed not only in medicine, but also in all\r\nthe branches of philosophy; he should be a good logician; he should be\r\nfamiliar with the writings of medical authors; he should be virtuous\r\nand ethical; he should be trustworthy; he should not be avaricious nor\r\nenvious; ... and, finally, he should be thoroughly familiar with all\r\nthe diseases to which the human body is liable. In one place Lanfranchi\r\nrefers to the fact that exposure to the air favors the production of\r\npus in a wound. Among the methods which may be employed for arresting\r\nhemorrhage he mentions digital compression and ligaturing of the\r\nbleeding vessels. He recommends that a wounded individual should\r\nabstain from wine and from an over-nutritious diet. No attempt, he\r\nsays, should be made to extirpate, with the knife or by means of the\r\nactual cautery, an ulcerated cancer, unless it appears probable that\r\nby such means complete destruction of the tumor may be effected. In\r\ntraumatic tetanus dependent upon an injury of a tendon or nerve trunk\r\nhe recommends complete division of the wounded structure.\r\n\r\nPart II. is devoted to the consideration of wounds of the different\r\nparts of the body, taken in regular order from the head to the feet.\r\nThe descriptions, in each instance, are preceded by an adequate account\r\nof the region affected. In his discussion of fractures of the skull he\r\nspeaks of the diagnostic value of the rough and jarring sound perceived\r\nby the patient when the physician taps with a rod upon the injured\r\nskull; and he also states that an aid to diagnosis may be derived from\r\nthe fact that a person whose skull is fractured experiences pain at the\r\nseat of the injury when somebody passes the ends of his finger-nails\r\nalong a string which the patient holds suspended between his teeth.[67]\r\nAccording to Neuburger the description which Lanfranchi gives of\r\nthe various symptoms observed in cases of fracture of the skull is\r\nadmirable. In the section relating to the treatment of such fractures\r\nhe warns against the tendency to resort too readily to the use of the\r\ntrephine, and expresses the belief that this instrument should be\r\nemployed only when the fractured bone is depressed or when there is\r\nevidence of irritation of the dura mater.\r\n\r\nPart III. deals with skin diseases and various forms of tumors,\r\nincluding those of the thyroid gland; and with diseases of the eye,\r\nthe ear and the nasal cavities; with the various kinds of hernia; with\r\nrenal and cystic calculi; with hemorrhoids, varicose veins, etc.; with\r\nabdominal dropsy; and with still other affections. In bloodletting he\r\nrecommends the practice of opening the vein longitudinally. He is very\r\nemphatic in his manner of insisting that medicine and surgery should\r\nnot be divorced, and that the operation of drawing blood should not be\r\nintrusted to barbers.\r\n\r\nAfter the death or retirement of Lanfranchi during the first decade\r\nof the fourteenth century, Paris appears to have played, at least for\r\na few years, a comparatively small part in the history of medical\r\nteaching. Her rivals at Montpellier, in the south of France, and at\r\nBologna and Padua, in Italy, far outstripped her during this period.\r\nThere was one physician at Paris, however,--Henri de Mondeville,--who\r\nwould probably have proved a worthy successor of Lanfranchi if\r\ncircumstances had not seriously interfered with his acting the part of\r\na teacher.\r\n\r\n_Henri de Mondeville._--Henri de Mondeville, says Edouard\r\nNicaise, was born about 1260 A. D. in Normandy. In his native\r\nvillage--Mondeville or Mandeville, or Amondaville, all of which names\r\nare found in the manuscripts--he was known simply as Henri, but in the\r\noutside world and in medical literature he is mentioned, in accordance\r\nwith the prevailing custom of that period, as Henri de Mondeville.\r\nAfter studying medicine for a certain length of time in Paris and\r\nMontpellier, he went to Italy and became the pupil of Theodoric of\r\nBologna. He is said to have been passionately fond of surgery, which\r\nat that period was, in France, a much despised branch of medicine. In\r\nItaly, on the contrary, such men as William of Saliceto, Hugo of Lucca,\r\nTheodoric and Lanfranchi had raised surgery to a position of great\r\nhonor, and Henri de Mondeville cherished the hope that he also might be\r\nable to accomplish the same result in France. Upon his return to Paris\r\nhe was chosen one of the physicians (there were four in all) of the\r\nroyal household, and from that time onward he was frequently obliged to\r\nset aside, for longer or shorter periods, all his personal interests\r\n(private practice, lecturing to medical students, hospital service at\r\nHôtel-Dieu, etc.) in order to attend the King or the Comte de Valois\r\non some military expedition. This sort of service, however, was by no\r\nmeans time lost, for it afforded him the opportunity to acquire great\r\nexperience in the treatment of wounds, an experience which reveals\r\nitself on almost every page of his treatise on surgery. And yet there\r\ncame a time (1312) when de Mondeville complained bitterly of these\r\ninterruptions, for which he received no pay and which interfered\r\nseriously with his literary work. Despite these hindrances, he appears\r\nto have made a fair degree of progress in the writing of his book,\r\nfor at the date last named he gave a public reading of the first two\r\nsections “before a large and noble assemblage of medical students and\r\nother distinguished personages.” The portrait of de Mondeville which\r\nis here reproduced is a copy of the miniature which appears in one of\r\nthe manuscripts of his treatise that was prepared 1314 A. D., and is\r\nnow preserved in the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ at Paris. Nicaise\r\nfurnishes the following details regarding the original miniature.\r\n\r\n   Inasmuch as the MS. bears the date 1314 the portrait must have\r\n   been painted while De Mondeville was still living. The master is\r\n   represented wearing a violet-colored gown, red stockings, and a\r\n   black skull-cap. He is thin, his beard is scanty and of a grey\r\n   color like the hair of his head, his features are finely cut,\r\n   and he appears to be a fairly tall man. So far as one may judge\r\n   from this portrait De Mondeville’s age was then about fifty.\r\n\r\nThe date of his death is not known exactly, but it must have been\r\nsomewhere about 1320 A. D.\r\n\r\nNicaise sums up de Mondeville’s personal history and his contributions\r\nto the science of medicine somewhat as follows: He was a man of\r\nwarm impulses, who loved the truth and despised all shams. He never\r\nhesitated to speak his opinion about others, the King himself not being\r\nexcluded from his criticisms. He was also quite frank in his exposures\r\nof the ignorance of both nobles and members of the clergy. He was not\r\nin the least degree superstitious. He remained unmarried throughout\r\nlife and seems to have entertained a slight disposition to find fault\r\nwith women, for he attacks somewhat violently their mode of life and\r\ntheir extravagance, especially in the case of the women of Montpellier.\r\nAlthough he possessed a great reputation and a very large clientele of\r\npatients, he did not acquire a fortune. He is quoted as saying: “I was\r\nobliged from the very first to work hard for a living.” Suppuration,\r\naccording to the view of de Mondeville, was not a necessary phenomenon\r\nin the healing of wounds.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 11. HENRI DE MONDEVILLE.\r\n\r\n  (From Nicaise’s Version, Paris, 1893.)\r\n\r\n  From a miniature at the head of a manuscript which bears the\r\n  date A. D. 1313, now preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale at\r\n  Paris.]\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1316 the condition of de Mondeville’s health--he\r\nprobably had pulmonary tuberculosis--began to give him serious cause\r\nfor anxiety lest he might not live long enough to complete his book;\r\nand, as a matter of fact, the treatise which we now possess shows\r\nthat his fears proved to be well grounded. The important subjects\r\nof fractures, dislocations and hernia, for example, are mentioned\r\nonly casually. Those subjects, however, which he did discuss are\r\ntreated in a very clear and practical manner. Thus, for example, his\r\ninstructions with regard to the proper manner of treating wounds is\r\nmost satisfactory. Theodoric and he were the great champions of the\r\nso-called dry treatment, which had been introduced at some remote\r\nperiod of antiquity, but which apparently had not met with general\r\nacceptance. Then, again, in his remarks on the subject of amputations,\r\nhe taught that the ligaturing of the severed arteries after the removal\r\nof the amputated part, was universally recognized as the proper course\r\nto adopt and should never be neglected.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VII. of the first section of his treatise, de Mondeville\r\ngives a description of the anatomy of the heart and related\r\nblood-vessels, and at the same time furnishes an unusually clear\r\naccount of the physiology of the circulation which was universally\r\naccepted by the physicians of that period, as it had already been\r\nby those of earlier centuries. It seems desirable to reproduce this\r\naccount here in order that it may serve for purposes of comparison with\r\nthat which Harvey was to give three centuries later. It is only by\r\nmaking such a comparison that the physicians of our time can appreciate\r\nthe vast importance which attaches to Harvey’s wonderful discovery. De\r\nMondeville’s account, abbreviated wherever it seemed practicable to do\r\nthis, reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   The heart is the most important of all the organs. It transmits\r\n   to the other members of the body vitalizing blood, heat and\r\n   spirit. Its muscular tissue, unlike ordinary muscle, is composed\r\n   of three kinds of fibres, and it is not under the control of\r\n   the will. It has the shape of a pineapple and is located in\r\n   the centre of the chest, like a prince in the middle of his\r\n   kingdom. Its lower extremity is directed somewhat to the left\r\n   of the chest, as we are assured by the Philosopher (Aristotle)\r\n   in his history of animals. There are two reasons why it points\r\n   toward the left: 1., in order that it may not press upon the\r\n   liver or be pressed upon by it; and 2., in order that it may not\r\n   communicate its heat to the left side (the cool side) of that\r\n   organ.\r\n\r\n   It is important to note the fact that the heart is the only\r\n   structure which contains blood in its substance; in all the\r\n   other members of the body the blood is contained in the veins.\r\n   The base of the heart is situated at its highest point and\r\n   represents the broadest portion of the organ; it is attached to\r\n   the posterior wall of the chest by a few ligaments, than which\r\n   no stronger are to be found in any part of the body. These bands\r\n   do not touch the heart at any point except at the top, where\r\n   they take their origin; and their great strength is explained by\r\n   the fact that it is their duty to hold the heart firmly in its\r\n   proper position.\r\n\r\n   The heart possesses two ventricles or cavities, of which the\r\n   left one--by reason of the natural position of the organ as a\r\n   whole--is a little higher than the right. Between these two\r\n   cavities there is placed a partition which in its turn contains\r\n   a small cavity--termed by some _the third ventricle_.\r\n   Above each of the larger ventricles there is a sort of\r\n   appendix--cartilaginous in structure, but flexible and at\r\n   the same time strong,--which contains a cavity and has some\r\n   resemblance to a cat’s ear. These structures, to which the\r\n   common people have given the name _auricles_, alternately\r\n   contract and dilate. The purpose for which they exist is to\r\n   serve as reservoirs for the blood and air that are needed for\r\n   the nourishment and cooling of the heart.\r\n\r\n   To the right ventricle there comes a many-branched vein which\r\n   conducts to the heart a coarse, thick and warm blood destined\r\n   to nourish that organ. The portion of this abundant fluid which\r\n   is not needed for this purpose is then rendered less coarse and\r\n   thick by some subtle power possessed by the heart itself, after\r\n   which it is driven into the cavity that is located within the\r\n   partition wall which separates the ventricles the one from the\r\n   other. From this smaller cavity, this so-called third ventricle,\r\n   in which it receives additional heat and at the same time\r\n   undergoes further thinning as well as some kind of digestion and\r\n   purification, the blood passes on into the left ventricle and\r\n   there undergoes a further change--one which is characterized by\r\n   the development of that element which we call _spirit_,\r\n   something clearer, more subtle, more pure, more glorious than\r\n   any known substance in the human body, and therefore more nearly\r\n   allied in its nature to celestial things. This new element\r\n   forms a friendly and very appropriate link between the body and\r\n   the soul; it is the direct agent or instrument of the latter,\r\n   conveying to man the different faculties with which he may be\r\n   endowed.\r\n\r\n   From the left ventricle of the heart, alongside its auricle, two\r\n   arteries are given off. One of them, which is only furnished\r\n   with one tunic (as in the case of a vein) and which is called\r\n   the _arteria venalis_ (pulmonary vein), carries to the\r\n   lungs the blood which they require for their nourishment, and\r\n   breaks up into many branches after entering these structures;\r\n   the other artery is provided with two tunics and is called\r\n   _the grand artery_ (the aorta). From the latter vessel\r\n   are given off the numberless arteries which are distributed\r\n   throughout the entire body--vessels which transport to every\r\n   organ and structure both the blood which they need for their\r\n   nourishment and the spirit required for their revivification.\r\n   When this spirit passes into the ventricles of the brain it is\r\n   subjected to a new species of digestion, which converts it into\r\n   the _spirit of the soul_. Similarly, when it enters the\r\n   liver it becomes _a nutritive spirit_; when it enters the\r\n   testicles, _a generative spirit_, and so on through all the\r\n   different organs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n     DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE MIDDLE AGES SURGERY ASSUMES THE\r\n        MOST PROMINENT PLACE IN THE ADVANCE OF MEDICAL SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the fourteenth century, as has been shown\r\nin the preceding chapter, Henri de Mondeville was largely successful\r\nin rendering Paris the most prominent centre of medical activity in\r\nFrance, if not in Western Europe generally. His life, however, was\r\nshort, and his position as one of the leading surgeons of the French\r\nArmy subjected him to many and prolonged interruptions, for which\r\nreasons he was not able to complete his excellent treatise on surgery.\r\nNo physician of the same intellectual capacity and of equally strong\r\ncharacter appears to have been living in Paris at the time of De\r\nMondeville’s death, and consequently the importance of that city as a\r\ncentre of medical education diminished rapidly after that event. On\r\nthe other hand, the Medical School at Montpellier in the southern part\r\nof France began at about this period, under the influence of Arnold of\r\nVillanova (probably a small town in Catalonia, Spain, in the diocese of\r\nValencia), to acquire importance.\r\n\r\n_Arnold of Villanova and the Medical School of\r\nMontpellier._--Arnold of Villanova was born about 1240 A. D., of\r\nhumble parentage. He obtained his early education in a Dominican\r\ncloister, and afterward devoted all his energies to the study of\r\nlanguages (especially Hebrew), theology, philosophy, the natural\r\nsciences (physics, alchemy), and medicine. Paris and Montpellier were\r\nthe principal cities in which he prosecuted those studies. Already as\r\nearly as the year 1270, Arnold had attained considerable celebrity\r\nas a physician. Between the years 1289 and 1299 he appears to have\r\nmade his home in Montpellier, and to have been very actively engaged\r\nboth as a practicing physician and as a teacher of medicine. It was\r\nin that city also that he wrote the more important of his numerous\r\nmedical treatises. At a later period of his life he appears largely\r\nto have lost his interest in medicine, for in 1299 we find him acting\r\nas an ambassador from the King of Aragon, whose private physician\r\nhe was, to the Court of Philippe le Bel, King of France, and deeply\r\nentangled, during his stay in Paris, in disputes with the theologians\r\nof that city respecting certain religious doctrines. He was also at\r\nthe same time busily engaged in championing various ecclesiastic\r\nreforms which he was anxious to see inaugurated. His opponents haled\r\nhim before the tribunal of the Inquisition and succeeded in having him\r\ncast into prison, where he remained until he expressed a willingness\r\nto retract the obnoxious opinions which he had advanced. The same\r\ntribunal pronounced his treatise “_De Adventu Antichristi_” to\r\nbe heretical. After these persecutions Arnold endeavored to procure\r\naid and comfort from Popes Boniface VIII. and Benedict XI. The former\r\nwas inclined in his favor, but Benedict manifested no disposition to\r\naid him. Boniface’s sentiments were doubtless influenced by the fact\r\nthat Arnold had treated him successfully for stone in the bladder; and\r\nNeuburger incidentally states that, in the effecting of this cure,\r\nnot only medical and dietetic treatment had been employed, but also\r\ntwo other measures--viz., the application of a bandage or truss which\r\nencircled the loins snugly, and the wearing (by the patient) of a\r\nmagic seal ring upon which was engraved the effigy of a lion.[68] When\r\nPope Clement V. (1305–1315 A. D.) removed the papal seat from Rome\r\nto Avignon, in France, Arnold was relieved from the charge of heresy\r\nand reinstated in the respect of his contemporaries. He became the\r\ntrusted adviser of royalty, won the sympathy of Jayme II. and of his\r\nbrother, Frederic III., King of Sicily, for his broad-minded views\r\nregarding religious matters, and was both hated and feared by his\r\nenemies. According to trustworthy chronicles, Arnold of Villanova died\r\nat sea in 1311, within sight of the coast of Genoa, while he was on a\r\nvoyage (probably from Sicily) to visit the Court of Clement V. In 1316\r\nthe Inquisition pronounced most of his philosophical and theological\r\nwritings heretical, and ordered them to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nA complete collection of the medical writings of Arnold of Villanova,\r\nso far at least as they were then known to exist, was printed at\r\nLyons, France, in 1586. It is said that many of the treatises which\r\nthis author wrote have been lost. Of those which have come down to our\r\ntime there are only three which call for any special comment--Arnold’s\r\n“_Breviarium_,” a compendium of the practice of medicine; his\r\n“_Commentary on the Regimen Salernitanum_,” the sales of which,\r\naccording to Neuburger, reached an enormous figure; and a work which\r\nbears the title “_Parabolae medicationis secundum instinctum\r\nveritatis aeternae, quae dicuntur a medicis regulae generales\r\ncurationis morborum_.” (Basel, 1560.) The latter treatise, which\r\nmight with propriety be given the simple title of “General Rules\r\nregarding the Treatment of Diseases,” is dedicated (1300 A. D.) to\r\nPhilippe le Bel, King of France. It contains a number of chapters on\r\nthe principles of general pathology, and others on special pathology\r\nand therapeutics, with relation both to internal diseases and to\r\nthose which particularly interest the surgeon. It also furnishes 345\r\naphorisms, many of which embody truths of the highest importance and\r\nreveal the author to have been a man of independent judgment, of wide\r\nexperience, and of a philosophical type of mind.\r\n\r\nIn the “_Parabolae_” and the “_Breviarium_,” says Neuburger,\r\nare to be found the most marked evidences of the knowledge and ability\r\nwhich this great physician possessed. He then adds:--\r\n\r\n   Arnold attached much importance to hygiene and the proper\r\n   regulation of the diet as effective measures in preventing\r\n   diseases, and he formulated an admirable set of rules for\r\n   the ordering of one’s manner of living. In these he gives\r\n   prominence to the value of baths, to the importance of taking\r\n   a certain amount of physical exercise, and to the selection\r\n   of the right kinds of food. He also describes in detail how\r\n   wine may be utilized advantageously in cases of illness. As\r\n   regards the choice of remedies to be employed he says that the\r\n   physician should be guided by a very careful consideration\r\n   of the patient’s age, temperament, habits of living, etc.;\r\n   and, so long as there remains any doubt about the correctness\r\n   of the diagnosis, he should employ only mild and indifferent\r\n   remedies. The greatest care, he adds, should be exercised in the\r\n   preparation of the drugs that are to be administered, and one\r\n   should be very cautious about prescribing substances which have\r\n   not been sufficiently tried.\r\n\r\nArnold’s writings are full of precepts which, like those quoted above,\r\nshow him to have been an excellent practitioner of medicine as well as\r\na man of sound common sense. And yet at the same time he appears to\r\nhave been more or less tainted with the prevailing belief in astrology,\r\nin the efficacy of amulets (as in the case of Pope Boniface referred\r\nto on a previous page), etc. His enemies gave him the reputation\r\nof being a sorcerer upon whom the Devil had bestowed the power of\r\ntransmuting metals,--a reputation which undoubtedly was based upon the\r\nfact that Arnold interested himself greatly in alchemistic processes,\r\noften referring to them as closely resembling such organic phenomena\r\nas generation, birth, growth, etc. But, in our judgment of the man,\r\nwe should be careful to remember that during the thirteenth century a\r\nbelief in alchemy, astrology, the efficacy of amulets, the influence\r\nof supernatural agencies, etc., was almost universal. Even theologians\r\nmaintained that it was a sin for a practitioner of medicine to neglect\r\nthe influence of certain constellations. Indeed, there are even to-day,\r\nnot a few very sensible people in whose minds exists a lingering belief\r\nin the interference of supernatural agencies in human affairs.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the influence which Arnold of Villanova exerted upon\r\nthe progress of medical science, and more especially upon the fame of\r\nthe Medical School of Montpellier, should not be estimated exclusively\r\nfrom the value of his writings nor from the character of the work\r\nwhich he performed as an instructor in that school. In the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries physicians as a class did not hold so high\r\na position socially in Western Europe as they were probably entitled\r\nto hold, and consequently Arnold’s later career, in which he showed\r\nhimself to be a wise, broad-minded, and very able statesman and as\r\nan enthusiastic champion of greater liberty of thought in the domain\r\nof religion, must be looked upon as having aided very materially in\r\nraising the profession of medicine to a higher rank and in adding éclat\r\nto the School of Montpellier.\r\n\r\n_Contemporaries and Successors of Arnold of Villanova at\r\nMontpellier._--During Arnold’s lifetime there does not appear to\r\nhave been another physician at Montpellier who could be compared with\r\nhim in professional ability or in general culture. There was one,\r\nhowever, who attained considerable fame as a medical author, and who\r\ncertainly deserves at least a brief notice in this place--Bernard de\r\nGourdon, also known as Gordonius.\r\n\r\nBernard de Gourdon[69] began teaching medicine in Montpellier in 1285\r\nA. D. He was the author of a treatise which bore the title “_Lilium\r\nMedicinae_,” and which enjoyed an unusual degree of popularity for\r\na long period of time. The earliest printed edition appeared in Lyons\r\nin 1474 and was followed by several others in 1491, 1550, 1559 and\r\n1574. One of the latest editions is that of Frankfort, 1617. The book\r\nwas also translated into both French and Spanish. In his description\r\nof the seven parts into which the book is divided, the author says, by\r\nway of praising his own work: “In the lily there are many different\r\nkinds of blossoms and in each one of these there are seven grains of a\r\ngolden character.” The book treats of fevers, poisonings, abscesses,\r\ntumors, wounds and ulcers, of diseases of the liver, spleen, kidneys\r\nand bladder, of affections of the eyes, and of numerous other topics.\r\nThe work as a whole, says Neuburger, lacks depth and thoroughness,\r\nand reveals the author to be overfond of employing drugs, especially\r\nin combination, and by no means free from a belief in the efficacy of\r\namulets and other supernatural remedies. It contains, however, one\r\nor two references to matters of historical interest. For example, in\r\nChapter V., Part III., mention is made of spectacles. So far as now\r\nappears, this is the first time that these useful contrivances are\r\nreferred to in medical literature; and the casual manner in which the\r\nauthor speaks of them suggests the idea that they had already been\r\nknown for some time. Possibly Roger Bacon, who interested himself in\r\nresearches in the department of optics and who was a contemporary\r\nof Gordonius, may have had something to do with the invention of\r\nspectacles.\r\n\r\nAt the ceremony of the marriage of the Duchess Juta of Austria to\r\nCount Louis of Oettingen, at Vienna in 1319, Pietro Buonaparte, the\r\nPodesta of Padua, created considerable excitement by wearing a pair of\r\nspectacles which he had received a short time previously from Salvino\r\ndegli Armati of Florence, the reputed inventor of these contrivances.\r\nIt is not generally known that the printing of books in very large\r\nand bold type during the latter part of the fifteenth and the early\r\npart of the sixteenth centuries was done expressly for the benefit of\r\nfar-sighted readers--this defect in vision characterizing a very large\r\npercentage of the learned men of that period. The great number of books\r\nwhich, during those early days of the art of printing, were published\r\nin this style, emphasizes the fact that the usefulness of spectacles\r\nwas not generally appreciated until after the lapse of many scores of\r\nyears. Being very expensive they were within the reach of only persons\r\nof wealth, and, in addition, they were extremely difficult to obtain.\r\nAs late as during the year 1572, Augustus, Elector of Saxony, moved by\r\na strong wish to possess a pair of spectacles, despatched a special\r\nmessenger first to Leipzig and then to Augsburg with instructions to\r\npurchase them for him at the great annual fair. This agent, however,\r\nwas unsuccessful in the attempt, and, accordingly, in the summer of\r\n1574, he was instructed to ride on as far as Venice. But, on arriving\r\nthere, he was informed that no glasses would be ground before the\r\nmonth of October. He was consequently obliged to remain in that city\r\nuntil the autumn, at which time he sent word to his master that the\r\noptician’s charge for the instrument would be 50 thalers (equivalent to\r\n$250 at the present value of money). The Elector, it appears, was only\r\ntoo glad to pay this sum for the coveted article. The first spectacles\r\nmade were equipped with only convex glasses, for the use of far-sighted\r\npersons. It was not until about two hundred years later that the art of\r\ngrinding concave glasses for the relief of short-sighted individuals\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\n_Guy de Chauliac._--After the lapse of a few years there appeared\r\na man who was destined to add greatly to the fame of the Medical\r\nSchool of Montpellier--not in the way in which Arnold of Villanova\r\nhad accomplished this result, but by the publication of the first\r\nsystematic treatise on surgery which was written in Western Europe\r\nduring the Middle Ages. This man was Guy de Chauliac, about whose early\r\nlife very little is known. He was born in the village of Chauliac, in\r\nAuvergne, France, toward the end of the thirteenth century, his parents\r\nbeing simple peasants; and during early boyhood he probably attended\r\nthe school connected with the village church. His medical studies were\r\nbegun at Toulouse and completed at Montpellier. But, at some time later\r\nthan 1326, he went to Bologna and perfected his knowledge of anatomy\r\nunder the guidance of Bertrucius, Mondino’s successor. After leaving\r\nBologna Guy visited Paris, arriving there subsequently to the deaths\r\nof Lanfranchi, Pitard and Henri de Mondeville. Although he remained in\r\nthat great city only a short time, he appears to have formed a warm\r\nfriendship with several of the instructors in the medical school.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1330 he took up his residence in Lyons. His appointment\r\nto the position of Canon of Saint-Just, a church which is located in\r\nthat city, doubtless made it necessary for him to adopt this course.\r\nAnd yet it is most improbable that he spent much of his time in Lyons,\r\nfor his other duties--his attendance at the Papal Court in Avignon,\r\nas private physician to three Popes in succession, and the numerous\r\ncalls made upon him for professional advice and especially for surgical\r\nassistance by people living at a long distance from Lyons--compelled\r\nhim repeatedly to absent himself from his home, sometimes for several\r\ndays at a time. In 1348 the plague visited Avignon and carried off\r\nlarge numbers of people, the poet Petrarch’s Laura being one of\r\nthe victims. During that terrible epidemic Guy was most faithful\r\nin his devotion to Clement VI. and to many others who needed his\r\nprofessional services. In 1357 he was promoted by Innocent VI. to the\r\noffice of Provost of Saint-Just. In 1363 when--according to, his own\r\ndeclaration--he was an old man, he wrote the treatise on surgery which\r\nhas rendered his name famous in the history of medicine. His death\r\noccurred about July 23, 1368.\r\n\r\nGuy was not, as some writers have asserted, a professor of surgery in\r\nthe University of Montpellier; he was simply a physician who had won at\r\nthat institution the title of “Master in Medicine”--the highest grade\r\nconferred by the university authorities, and one which necessarily\r\nimplied that the recipient had given a certain number of public\r\nreadings on medical topics. And yet in actual practice Guy manifested\r\na strong preference for the management of diseases which demanded\r\nsurgical treatment. His writings, furthermore, make it clear that he\r\nhad a strong affection for the institution in which he had been both a\r\nstudent and in some measure an instructor.\r\n\r\nThe book which Guy de Chauliac wrote, and which bears the title\r\n“_La Grande Chirurgie_,” is described by Malgaigne,[70] one of\r\nthe most distinguished French surgeons of the nineteenth century, in\r\nthe following terms: “I do not hesitate to say that, with the single\r\nexception of the book written by Hippocrates, there is not a work on\r\nsurgery, no matter in what language written, which ranks higher than,\r\nor is even equal to, the magnificent treatise of Guy de Chauliac.”\r\nAlthough most surgeons of the present day will scarcely assent to\r\npraise of such an extravagant nature, they will undoubtedly agree\r\nin according to this admirable author of the fourteenth century a\r\nhigh place of honor in the Temple of Fame. Nicaise, the editor of the\r\nmost recent version of Guy de Chauliac’s treatise, speaks of him as\r\nthe “founder of didactic surgery.” From 1363 A. D., the date of its\r\nfirst publication in manuscript, to 1478, a period of more than one\r\nhundred years, Guy’s book was universally regarded as the authoritative\r\ntreatise on surgery. But this branch of medicine, it must not be\r\nforgotten, was, at that period of the Middle Ages, held in very small\r\nesteem by physicians generally, and therefore it is almost certain that\r\nGuy received no encouragement whatever from any outside source. All\r\nthe greater credit, therefore, is due him for the admirable manner in\r\nwhich he carried on the task which he had set before himself during the\r\nlast years of his life. Extraordinary as it appears to us to-day, the\r\nMontpellier School of Medicine, toward the end of the fifteenth century\r\n(that is, only a comparatively short time after Guy’s death), issued a\r\ndecree that thereafter their pupils were not to study nor to practice\r\nsurgery. From this and other well-authenticated facts it appears that\r\nthe prejudice which existed at that period among physicians against\r\nsurgery, was strong enough to render them blind to the reality that\r\nit was through the instrumentality of this very branch of medical\r\nactivity that the school at Montpellier had gained such an increase\r\nin celebrity. They were unable to dispossess their minds of the idea\r\nthat operative and all other surgical procedures were derogatory to the\r\ndignity of the educated physician.\r\n\r\nGuy de Chauliac wrote his treatise originally in Latin--not the\r\nLatin of the classical authors, but a Latin greatly deformed by the\r\nintroduction of French, Arabic and Provençal terms--barbaric Latin,\r\nas it is often called. This language was commonly employed at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier and at all other universities at that period;\r\nbut, as Nicaise states, the style of his writing is so concise, and at\r\nthe same time so intelligible, that it would scarcely be possible to\r\ntranslate it into modern French without the loss of much of that which\r\nconstitutes the charm of the book. It was for the latter reason that\r\nhe decided to write his version of Guy’s treatise in old French--the\r\nFrench of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. In order that our\r\nreaders, most of whom are doubtless more or less familiar with the\r\nfinished language of modern French literature, may see for themselves\r\nto what extent the latter differs from its fourteenth century ancestor,\r\nI shall introduce here a single paragraph of Nicaise’s text. I have\r\nchosen it, more or less at random, from the admirable chapter which Guy\r\nhas written on wounds in general.\r\n\r\n   Consequemment playes mortelles non necessairement, ains pour la\r\n   pluspart, sont petites playes, et superficielles és susdites\r\n   parties, et qui penetrent iusques à icelles et aux chefs\r\n   des muscles. La raison est, parce que si elles ne sont bien\r\n   traitées, il advient qu’on en meurt: et si sont bien traitées,\r\n   on en guerit: ainsi que i’ay veu de la partie posterieure du\r\n   cerveau, de laquelle sortit un peu de la substance du cerveau,\r\n   ce qui fut reconnu par l’offense de la mémoire, laquelle il\r\n   recouvra apres la curation. Ie ne dis pas toutesfois qu’on\r\n   vesquit, s’il en sortoit toute une cellule, comme Theodore\r\n   raconte d’un cellier. Aussi Galen ne dit pas, de deux blessez\r\n   qu’il vit guerir en Smyrne du vivant de son maistre Pelope,\r\n   qu’il en fust sorty de la substance de cerveau, ains seulement\r\n   que le cerveau avoit esté blessé: Ne, de celuy qu’il vist guery\r\n   en Smyrne (comme il recite au huitiesme de _l’Usage_), il\r\n   ne dit pas qu’il en sortit de la substance du cerveau, ains\r\n   qu’il fust blessé en l’un des ventricules gemeaux. Et avec ce\r\n   on pensoit qu’il fust guery par le vouloir de Dieu. Car si tous\r\n   deux eussent esté blessez, il n’eust gueres duré, comme il dit:\r\n   et de ce il conclud l’utilite de la duplication de quelques\r\n   instruments, ainsi qu’a esté dit cy dessus en l’anatomie. Et\r\n   tant de cettui-cy, que de ceux-là, la guerison rare est fort\r\n   rarement faite, comme il est dit au commentaire dessus allegué.\r\n\r\nThere are many places in Guy’s treatise where his description of a\r\nsurgical condition, or of the proper measures to adopt for the relief\r\nor cure of such condition, would doubtless prove interesting to our\r\nreaders, and would in any event aid them materially in forming an\r\nindependent judgment as to the man’s character in general and also\r\nwith regard to his qualifications as a surgeon. But all of these\r\ndescriptions, when rendered in their entirety into English, occupy much\r\nspace, and for this reason I shall be obliged to furnish here merely a\r\nfew extracts from some of the more interesting portions of the text.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter which Guy devotes to wounds of nerves, cords and\r\nligaments--all of which structures were classed by him, as well as by\r\nGalen, as belonging to the category of nerves--this author divides them\r\ninto punctured and incised wounds, bruises and concussions. As to the\r\nfirst variety he says that they may be divided into closed punctured\r\nand open punctured wounds.\r\n\r\n   In the incised wounds two kinds may be distinguished: those in\r\n   which the nerve is incised in the direction of its length and\r\n   those in which the cut is made across the fibres. A further\r\n   subdivision is practicable, viz., into wounds accompanied by\r\n   more or less destruction of the substance of the nerve or its\r\n   envelopes, and those in which such loss has not occurred. Among\r\n   other differences worthy of mention are these: pain, spasmodic\r\n   phenomena, and abscess formation are present in certain cases\r\n   and absent in others. From all of which symptoms useful\r\n   indications as to the treatment needed may be deduced.\r\n\r\nIn the section relating to the treatment of such traumatic affections\r\nof nerves, Guy makes the remark that the measures called for are, for\r\nthe most part, the same as those required for wounds involving simply\r\nthe fleshy parts of the body.\r\n\r\n   The element of pain, however, is one of the factors which\r\n   distinguish wounds of a nerve from ordinary flesh wounds, and\r\n   it may necessitate some slight modification of the treatment.\r\n   Aside from this, one of the first things that should be done is\r\n   to remove from the wound all foreign substances; after which\r\n   the edges of the cavity should be brought together and held\r\n   firmly in this position by appropriate means. Last of all, care\r\n   should be taken to protect the parts. These are the general\r\n   principles which are to guide the surgeon’s action. As to the\r\n   special details, they must depend upon the different conditions\r\n   presented by each individual case. Thus, for example, if we are\r\n   dealing with a punctured wound of a nerve, there will be no\r\n   edges of an excavation to bring together.\r\n\r\n   If the object which produced the puncture is still lodged in the\r\n   tissues, it must, as a matter of course, be withdrawn. After\r\n   which, the further measures to be adopted may be enumerated\r\n   under the following heads: careful regulation of the manner of\r\n   living; removal from the system of all material which--attracted\r\n   to the wounded part by the pain--might there cause irritation or\r\n   inflammation; and protection of the body against any harm that\r\n   might come to it through the occurrence of convulsions. These\r\n   three measures are indicated for all wounds of nerves. But, in\r\n   the case of a punctured wound, still other procedures should be\r\n   employed, as will be discussed under a fourth head.\r\n\r\nThe four heads mentioned by Guy may be briefly stated in the following\r\nterms: I. The patient should be put upon a light and very simple diet;\r\nand, in addition, he should be given a bed that is soft and humid\r\n(“_humidus et mollis_”). His surroundings should be kept quiet,\r\nand nothing should be permitted to disturb his peace of mind. II. To\r\nprotect his tissues from the injurious influence of any superfluous\r\nmatters of an irritating nature that may be circulating in the blood\r\n(_i.e._, cacochyme), a vein on the opposite side of the body\r\nshould be opened and a certain amount of this fluid withdrawn. In\r\ncertain cases, furthermore, it may be well, in addition, to administer\r\nan aperient remedy. III. If convulsions develop, the head, neck and the\r\nentire back should be anointed with well-warmed linseed oil or common\r\n(? olive) oil, as recommended by Galen. IV. Special measures should be\r\nadopted for providing a free outlet for any pus that may form in the\r\ndeeper parts of the wound; and here again Galen recommends for this\r\npurpose the employment of one of several medicinal preparations which\r\nhe enumerates. “But the more certain course,” Guy adds, “is to make an\r\nopening in the skin either with the razor or with the actual cautery\r\n(which latter, according to Henri de Mondeville, is the better plan of\r\nthe two), and then to apply some subtle drying remedy which possesses\r\nthe power to penetrate into the deepest recesses of the injured\r\nnerve--for example, savin oil.” (Guy has a good deal more to say on the\r\nsubject of wounds of nerves, but the few extracts given above should\r\nsuffice.)\r\n\r\nIt is now a well-known fact that Guy de Chauliac was in the habit of\r\ntreating fractures of the thigh by the employment of the weight and\r\npulley as means of keeping up a continuing extension of the damaged\r\nlimb. As his description of the method in question is very brief, it\r\nmay not seem out of place to reproduce it here. Translated into English\r\nit reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   As to the plan which I employ, it is this: After making fast\r\n   to the fractured thigh splints which extend down as far as the\r\n   feet, I reinforce the support which they give, either by placing\r\n   the limb in a box or by applying to its sides bundles of straw\r\n   (_appuyements_). [These are shown in the left-hand lower\r\n   corner of Fig. 12.] I then attach to the foot a mass of lead as\r\n   a weight, taking care to pass the cord which supports the lead\r\n   over a small pulley in such a manner that it shall pull upon the\r\n   leg in a longitudinal direction. And if it then be found that\r\n   there is not complete equality between the fractured limb and\r\n   its fellow as regards length, the discrepancy may be corrected\r\n   by gently pulling upon the former. Every nine days the limb\r\n   should be cautiously handled; and at the end of about fifty days\r\n   it will be found that firm union has taken place.\r\n\r\nOne more remark seems to be called for in reference to the fact that\r\nGuy de Chauliac, although he was avowedly a surgeon, managed to win\r\nas great a reputation and as high a social position as was possessed\r\nby any physician of that period. The medical practitioner, it will be\r\nremembered, held himself, during the Middle Ages, and was universally\r\nheld, to be a much higher type of man than the surgeon. The relative\r\nstanding of the two is well shown in the accompanying sketch (Fig.\r\n13), in which all the details (attitude, head gear, gown, etc.) have\r\nevidently been carefully studied by the artist. Guy, however, through\r\nthe sheer force of his character, and also probably because he was\r\nknown to have won the highest medical honor (the grade of “Master of\r\nMedicine”) which it was in the power of the university to confer,\r\npushed his way to the top, and held, for a period of twenty years, the\r\nposition of private physician to three Popes in succession--Clement\r\nVI., Innocent VI. and Urban V. In other words, the prevailing\r\nprejudices and jealousies were not sufficiently powerful to block the\r\ntriumphant career of this man of solid merit and high character.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 12.

Nicaise, Paris,\r\n 1895.)]\r\n\r\n_The State of Medicine and Surgery in Countries Other than Italy\r\nand France During the Later Portion of the Middle Ages._--From the\r\naccount given by Neuburger it appears that the seeds planted by the\r\nfamous teachers of medicine and surgery in Italy and France during\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had begun to take root in\r\nEngland and in the Low Countries to the north of France, and were\r\nin fact already producing some good fruit in those lands. Thus, for\r\nexample, there have been handed down to our time the names of four\r\nphysicians who attained a certain degree of eminence in England during\r\nthe thirteenth and fourteenth centuries--Gilbertus Anglicus, John of\r\nGaddesden, John Mirfeld and John Arderne.\r\n\r\n_Gilbertus Anglicus_, who was the first English medical writer\r\nto secure a certain degree of celebrity among the physicians of\r\ncontinental Europe, wrote a compendium of medicine that was commonly\r\ncalled the “_Laurea anglica_.” The book contains, along with some\r\ngood original observations and the records of his own experience, not a\r\nfew wearisome theoretical discussions; and at the same time it reveals\r\nthe fact that the author was inclined to favor remedial measures\r\nof a superstitious nature. In the last chapter of his compendium,\r\nhowever, he makes the very practical suggestion that distillation may\r\nbe resorted to when one desires to purify water that is contaminated.\r\nGilbertus, after obtaining his preliminary training in England\r\nin the early part of the thirteenth century, visited some of the\r\nleading schools on the continent, among others those of Salerno and\r\nMontpellier, in which latter city he appears to have practiced medicine\r\nfor a certain length of time.\r\n\r\n_John of Gaddesden_, who is also spoken of as Johannes Anglicus,\r\nwas born about 1280 A. D. and died in 1361. He was therefore a\r\ncontemporary of Guy de Chauliac. He is said to have been a Fellow of\r\nMerton College, Oxford, and to have held the positions of Prebendary\r\nof St. Paul’s, London, and of private physician to the royal family.\r\nHe was also the author of a medical treatise which was generally known\r\nby the title, “_Rosa Anglica_” (first printed in 1492). Neuburger\r\nspeaks of this book as being an imitation of Gourdon’s “_Lilium\r\nMedicinae_,” but of a somewhat inferior grade, and he quotes two\r\nor three passages which show that medicine was in a very low stage of\r\ndevelopment in England at the beginning of the fourteenth century.\r\nGaddesden, for example, advises his confrères to adopt the rule of\r\nalways securing their honorarium before they undertake the treatment of\r\na sick person. In another part of the book he states that he treated\r\none of the sons of Edward II. for small-pox and secured excellent\r\nresults, not merely as regards the perfect restoration of his health,\r\nbut also as regards the complete prevention of any pitting of his face.\r\nHe attributes this success to the fact that he enveloped the patient in\r\na red cloth and took pains to have every object in the vicinity of the\r\nbed draped in red.[71]\r\n\r\n_John Mirfeld_, who lived during the second half of the fourteenth\r\ncentury, completed his medical studies in Oxford, then entered\r\nthe Monastery of St. Bartholomew’s in London, and devoted himself\r\nthenceforward to work in connection with the hospital belonging to that\r\ninstitution. Among the books which he wrote there are a few that deal\r\nwith matters of interest to the physician. Such, for example, are a\r\nglossary which bears the title “_Synonyma Bartholomaei_,” a work\r\ncalled the “_Breviarium Bartholomaei_,” and a shorter treatise\r\non prognosis--the “_Speculum_.” None of these, however, possesses\r\nany special importance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 13. THE PHYSICIAN, THE SURGEON AND THE\r\n  PHARMACIST.\r\n\r\n  Reproduction of a miniature at the head of Guy de Chauliac’s\r\n  _La Grande Chirurgie_, edited by E. Nicaise, Paris, 1890.]\r\n\r\n_John Arderne_ was born in England 1307 A. D., probably obtained\r\nhis medical training in Montpellier, accompanied the English Army to\r\nFrance in the character of a “Sergeant-Surgion,” and was present at the\r\nbattle of Crécy (1346 A. D.). During the succeeding twenty-four years\r\nhe practiced medicine in Wiltshire and Newark, and then settled for\r\nthe remainder of his life in London. Although his practice included\r\nboth internal diseases and those which required surgical treatment, the\r\ngreat reputation which he acquired was based chiefly upon his success\r\nin the latter field. Most of his writings, it appears, are still in the\r\nform of manuscript. They deal chiefly with surgery and are accompanied\r\nby drawings of the instruments which he employed. They possess one\r\nfeature which distinguishes them from the majority of medical writings\r\nof the Middle Ages, viz., they abound in reports of cases observed and\r\ntreated by the author; and, furthermore, the methods of treatment which\r\nhe recommends are in most instances rational and of a relatively simple\r\nnature. The only one of Arderne’s treatises which has been printed\r\nis that relating to _fistula in ano_. It bears the title, “John\r\nArderne--Treatises of Fistula in Ano, Haemorrhoids, and Clysters; from\r\nan early fifteenth-century manuscript translation,” and is edited by\r\nD’Arcy Power, Early English Text Society, Original Series, 139; London\r\nand Oxford, 1910. Arderne, we are told by Neuburger, puts forward two\r\nclaims: 1, that he succeeded in curing a large number of cases of anal\r\nfistula, in proof of which he gives the names of the persons upon whom\r\nhe operated successfully, many of whom are high up in the social scale;\r\nand, 2, that no other surgeon of whom he has any knowledge, either in\r\nEngland or on the continent of Europe, is able to cure the disease.\r\n\r\nThe three English physicians of whom I have here given very brief\r\naccounts, can scarcely be said to compare favorably with those men\r\nwho, during the same period, brought fame to the medical schools of\r\nBologna, Padua, Montpellier and Paris; and this fact suggests the\r\nquestion, Do these men really represent the best type of physicians who\r\nlived in England during the fourteenth century? The great English poet\r\nChaucer, in his “Canterbury Tales” (written at about the same period\r\nof time), furnishes us with a portrait of a man who appears to have\r\nbeen well informed with regard to the earlier Greek and Arabian medical\r\nauthorities as well as with the leading physicians of his own time,\r\nand who in addition was clever both in ascertaining the causes and\r\nnature of his patients’ maladies and in prescribing for them the proper\r\nremedies. As this physician’s name is not mentioned, we cannot be sure\r\nthat he was not one of the three to whom reference has just been made.\r\nBy the description given by the poet, who probably was personally\r\nacquainted with the man whose portrait he draws, one is tempted to\r\nbelieve that he was a physician of a higher type than any one of the\r\nthree named above. Chaucer’s account reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n    There was also a Doctor of Phisik,\r\n    In al this worlde was ther non him like\r\n    To speke of phisik and of surgerye;\r\n    For he was grounded in astronomye.\r\n    He kepte his pacient wondrously and we\r\n    In all houres by his magik natural.\r\n    Well coude he gesse the ascending of the star\r\n    Wherein his patientes fortunes settled were.\r\n    He knew the cause of every maladye,\r\n    Were it of cold, or hete, or moyst, or drye,\r\n    And where they engendered, and of what humour;\r\n    He was a very parfit practisour.\r\n    The cause once knowen and his right mesúre,\r\n    Anon he gaf the syke man his cure.\r\n    Ful redy hadde he his apothecaries,\r\n    To sende him drugges, and electuaries,\r\n    For eche of them made the other for to wynne;\r\n    Their friendshipe was not newe to begynne.\r\n    Wel knew he the old Esculapius,\r\n    And Discorides, and eek Rufus;\r\n    Old Ypocras, Haly and Galien;\r\n    Serapyon, Razis, and Avycen;\r\n    Averrois, Damascen, and Constantyn;\r\n    Bernard, and Gatisden, and Gilbertyn.\r\n    Of his diete mesuráble was he,\r\n    For it was of no superfluitee,\r\n    But of gret norishing and digestible.\r\n\r\nWith the names of the three English physicians mentioned above, there\r\nshould be associated that of Jehan Yperman, who was born in Ypern,\r\nFlanders, during the latter half of the thirteenth century, obtained\r\nhis professional training in Paris under Lanfranchi, and then, in\r\n1303 or 1304, accepted the position of Physician to the Hospital of\r\nBelle, a small Flemish town. In 1318 he settled permanently in Ypern,\r\nhis native city, and in a comparatively short time won completely the\r\nconfidence and esteem of his fellow townsmen through his attentiveness\r\nto their wants when they were ill and through the great skill which he\r\nmanifested in his work as a surgeon. He died 1329 A. D.\r\n\r\nYperman’s writings deal with both medical and surgical topics. Of\r\nthose which have been translated from the Latin into French are: “La\r\nchirurgie de maitre J. Yperman,” Anvers, 1863; “Traité de médecine\r\npratique de maitre J. Yperman,” Anvers, 1863; and “Traité de médecine\r\npratique de maitre J. Yperman,” Anvers, 1867. A perusal of these\r\nworks, says Neuburger, easily convinces one that Yperman was not only\r\na skilful and clever surgeon, but also a physician of independent\r\njudgment and wide experience.\r\n\r\n_Revival of the Practice of Dissecting Human Bodies._--It was in\r\nItaly that dissecting was carried on during the fourteenth century more\r\nvigorously than elsewhere in Europe. At first the only persons who made\r\nsuch investigations for scientific purposes were individual physicians\r\nor groups of physicians; and, in addition, they were obliged to carry\r\non the work in a secret manner--that is, by stealing from recently\r\ndug graves the corpses which were necessary for such studies. It is\r\nrelated, for example, that in 1319 one of the teachers in the Medical\r\nSchool at Bologna and four of his pupils were brought before the Court\r\nof Law under the charge of having clandestinely disinterred, for\r\npurposes of dissection, the body of a man who had been hung for some\r\ncrime. At first the authorities merely winked at such transgressions,\r\nbut at the same time they made no attempts to have the law against\r\ndissecting annulled or at least modified. Then, at a somewhat later\r\nperiod, the conviction became general among the intelligent members\r\nof the community that, unless work of this nature were officially\r\nsanctioned, no real advance in the knowledge of human anatomy could\r\nbe made, and--what was probably of even greater importance in their\r\nestimation--that Bologna might at the same time lose a good deal of its\r\nsuperiority over its rivals as a centre of learning; and accordingly\r\nit was found practicable to grant the desired sanction with many\r\nmodifying restrictions attached. Then, with the further lapse of time,\r\nother medical schools fell into line and secured from the authorities\r\nsimilar privileges for their teachers and pupils. Thus, in 1368, the\r\nSenate of Venice authorized the medical school of that city to make a\r\npublic dissection of a human body once every year; and, eight years\r\nlater, the University of Montpellier acquired the same privilege. In\r\n1391 John I. of Spain was equally generous in his treatment of the\r\nMedical School at Lerida. After the opening of the fifteenth century\r\nno further difficulties of a serious nature were experienced by the\r\nteachers of anatomy in procuring at least some material for dissecting\r\npurposes, and with each succeeding year such facilities steadily\r\nincreased. Unfortunately, however, there did not follow a corresponding\r\nincrease in the knowledge of human anatomy. As a matter of fact, it\r\nwas not until during the sixteenth century that any really valuable\r\nwork was accomplished in this branch of medicine. Guy de Chauliac,\r\nin the first chapter of his treatise (“_La Grande Chirurgie_”),\r\ngives the following description of the manner in which Bertrucius\r\ntaught anatomy in Bologna at the beginning of the fourteenth century,\r\nand from this account it is easy to understand why the additions to\r\nour stock of information in this department of medicine were so few\r\nand so unimportant during this long period. The so-called dissecting,\r\nit clearly appears, was in reality a not very profitable combination\r\nof purely anatomical work of a primitive character and a search\r\nfor evidences of pathological changes. The clinical history of the\r\nindividual whose body was undergoing examination does not seem to have\r\nplayed any part in the investigation. Here is De Chauliac’s account:--\r\n\r\n   After placing the dead body on a bench, my master proceeded with\r\n   his instructions, devoting thereto four separate sittings. At\r\n   the first of these he passed in review those parts or organs\r\n   which are concerned in nutrition; his reason for considering\r\n   them first being that they are the earliest to undergo\r\n   decomposition. At the second sitting he devoted himself to the\r\n   spiritual organs of the body; at the third, to the animal parts;\r\n   and at the fourth, to the extremities. Following the example\r\n   furnished by Galen in his commentary on the book entitled “The\r\n   Sects,” he maintained that there were nine things which should\r\n   be taken into consideration when one examines the different\r\n   parts of the body, to wit: their situation; their nature,\r\n   color, bulk, number, and shape; their connections or relations;\r\n   their actions and their utility; and the diseases which may\r\n   affect them. Conducted in this manner the study of anatomy, he\r\n   maintained, may prove helpful to the physician in recognizing\r\n   diseases, in making prognoses, and in selecting a suitable plan\r\n   for treatment.\r\n\r\nPuschmann, quoting from Hyrtl, says that when Professor Galeazzo di\r\nSanta Sofia, who had been called from Padua to Vienna to fill the\r\nChair of Anatomy in the medical school of that city, made his first\r\npublic dissection of a human body (1404 A. D.) in the Bürgerspital,\r\nthe sittings covered a period of eight days; at the end of which time\r\nhe collected as much money as he could from those who had attended\r\nthe course, and turned it over to the treasurer of the Faculty. Then\r\nfollowed a period of twelve years during which not a single public\r\ndissection of a human body was made in Vienna. In 1440 the Faculty were\r\ngreatly rejoiced over the prospect of receiving from the authorities\r\nthe body of a criminal who was to be hung on a certain day; but, when\r\nthe time arrived and the body had actually been delivered to them,\r\nthey were grievously disappointed by the sudden coming to life of the\r\nsupposed corpse. Instead of dissecting him for the benefit of science,\r\nthe doctors bestirred themselves in the man’s behalf, obtained a pardon\r\nin due form, and sent him back to his home in Bavaria under the escort\r\nof the college janitor. Not very long afterward, however, he committed\r\na fresh crime, and this time was effectively hung. History does not\r\nstate whether the dissection then came off, or not.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Faculty of the University of Tübingen established the rule\r\nin 1497 that one human body should be publicly dissected every three\r\nor four years; it being understood that during the progress of the\r\ndissection the professor should read aloud to the class appropriate\r\nportions of Mondino’s treatise on anatomy. The instruction in this\r\ndepartment of medical science was of the same general character in\r\nall the other universities of Germany at that period. Anatomical\r\ndrawings, of a very crude type, were employed as substitutes for actual\r\ndissection.\r\n\r\nAt Padua, in Northern Italy, the science of medicine had already before\r\nthe end of the first half of the fifteenth century made a decided\r\nadvance, in proof of which several circumstances may be mentioned. In\r\nthe first place, the importance of the study of anatomy had by this\r\ntime become so generally recognized that no special difficulty appears\r\nto have been encountered in securing the erection, in 1446, of an\r\nanatomical theatre; and during this same period several physicians\r\nconnected with the medical school acquired considerable celebrity by\r\ntheir publication of important treatises on topics belonging to the\r\ndomain of general pathology and therapeutics, and by the wide influence\r\nwhich they exerted as teachers. Among the number of those who helped\r\nin these ways to spread the fame of the Medical School of Padua may\r\nbe mentioned Hugo Benzi, Antonio Cermisone, Giovanni Savonarola and\r\nBartolommeo Montagnana.\r\n\r\n_Hugo Benzi_ (or Hugo of Siena) taught philosophy as well as\r\nmedicine in different institutions of learning--at Pavia, Piacenza,\r\nFlorence, Bologna, Parma, Padua and Perugia. His death probably\r\noccurred at Ferrara about the year 1439. In addition to commentaries\r\non Hippocrates, Galen and Avicenna, he wrote several practical works\r\n(“_Consilia_”) on such topics as periodical insanity, stomachic\r\nvertigo, naso-pharyngeal polypi, epilepsy, lachrymal fistula, etc.\r\n\r\n_Antonio Cermisone_ was a native of Padua, became a teacher of\r\nmedicine first in Pavia and afterward in Padua, wrote several useful\r\ntreatises about various diseases, and finally died about 1441.\r\n\r\n_Giovanni Michele Savonarola_--the grandfather of the celebrated\r\nGirolamo Savonarola, who was burned at the stake for heresy 1498 A.\r\nD.--held the Chair of Medicine in Padua from about 1390 to 1462, and\r\nalso subsequently for a certain length of time in Ferrara. He was the\r\nauthor of a number of treatises on practical medical topics--such,\r\nfor example, as fevers (first published in Venice in 1498), the art\r\nof preparing simple and compound _aqua vitae_ (Basel, 1597), an\r\nintroduction to the practice of medicine (1553), the baths of Italy and\r\nof the rest of the world (Venice, 1592), the different kinds of pulse,\r\netc. (Venice, 1497)--and he also wrote a large work covering the entire\r\nfield of medicine and modeled on the pattern of Avicenna’s “Canon.”\r\nThe book is divided into six parts, each of which is preceded by an\r\nintroduction that is devoted to the anatomico-physiological bearings\r\nof that particular part; and here, in addition, there are to be found\r\nscattered throughout the text references to surgical procedures.\r\nAmong the references of this character the following deserve to be\r\nmentioned as worthy of some notice: the description of a speculum for\r\nuse in operations upon the interior of the nose; a reference to direct\r\nlaryngoscopy; the description of an instrument closely resembling the\r\nwell-known syringotome; the treatment of curvature of the spine by\r\nmechanical means, etc. The book also reveals the fact that, already at\r\nthis period of the history of medicine (the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury), physicians were beginning to take a more active part than\r\nthey had previously done in the management of confinement cases, which\r\nas a rule were left entirely to the care of midwives. The records\r\nalso show that medical men were interesting themselves more and\r\nmore, as time went on, in sanitary science as applied to municipal\r\naffairs. In most communities the need for such was indeed most urgent\r\nat that time. The reforms of this nature were pushed with special\r\nvigor in those parts of Italy which were governed by that enlightened\r\nruler of the Hohenstaufen family, Frederic II., King of Sicily and\r\nRoman Emperor. The cultivation of personal hygiene was also pursued\r\nvery systematically during the later Middle Ages, the _Regimen\r\nSalernitanum_ serving as the guide in such matters.\r\n\r\nTaken all together the conditions in the physician’s world were in\r\nanything but a promising state toward the end of the fifteenth century;\r\nbut the dawn of better times, of modern medicine, was near at hand,\r\nand already signs of its approach were beginning to be recognizable in\r\ndifferent parts of Western Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n     BRIEF HISTORY OF THE ALLIED SCIENCES--PHARMACY, CHEMISTRY AND\r\n                          BALNEOTHERAPEUTICS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the excavations carried on at the site of Pompeii, there were\r\ndiscovered three houses which bore every appearance of having been\r\noccupied by apothecaries. Among the objects found in these buildings\r\nwere: A bronze box equipped with the apparatus required for mixing\r\nointments; a few surgical instruments; several glass receptacles\r\nwhich had evidently at some earlier period contained fluid or\r\nsemi-fluid pharmaceutical preparations, but which, at the time when\r\nthe excavations were made, presented merely a deposit of some solid\r\nbut easily friable substance at the bottom of the vessel; and quite\r\na variety of drugs in the form of pills, tablets, powders, etc. At\r\nfirst, the impression prevailed that these must have been the houses\r\nof apothecaries, but subsequently the discovery, in each instance, of\r\nthe house sign representing a snake with a pine cone in its mouth (the\r\nsymbol of Aesculapius) satisfied the authorities that these particular\r\nbuildings had belonged to physicians. Indeed, as a matter of fact, no\r\ngood reasons have thus far been found for believing that apothecaries,\r\nin the modern acceptation of the term, existed in even the largest\r\ncities of Greece and Italy until a much later date.\r\n\r\n_Pharmacy in Its Infancy._--All through the Hippocratic period and\r\nduring the years when Alexandria was at the height of its prosperity\r\nas the great centre of medical activity, it was customary for the\r\nphysicians to prepare their own drugs. The same is true of the best\r\nphysicians belonging to the Augustan period; they were not willing to\r\nput their trust in the drugs which had been prepared in the shops where\r\nsuch things were usually sold.\r\n\r\nIn the second century of the present era Galen gave the definition\r\nthat a remedial drug, or “Pharmakon,” was something which, when taken\r\ninto the living body, produces an alteration in its component tissues\r\nor organs, whereas foods or nutrient elements simply cause an increase\r\nof the parts. He attached great importance to such characteristics as\r\npurity, freshness, care in handling, etc. It was his custom to prepare\r\nwith his own hands the different combinations of simple remedial agents\r\nwhich he administered to his patients, and he kept these combinations,\r\nas well as the simple drugs of the more costly kinds, carefully stored\r\nin locked wooden boxes in a room which was devoted to this special\r\npurpose and which was termed the “Apotheke.” Originally, therefore,\r\nthe “apothecary” was simply the person who had charge of this room\r\nin which the drugs and spices were carefully “placed to one side”\r\n(ἀπό, τίθημι) for safe keeping. At a later period, when the\r\ncaretaker became also the compounder of drugs, another word of a more\r\ncomprehensive significance--that of “pharmacist”--gradually supplanted\r\nthe term apothecary.\r\n\r\nThere is another word, “antidote,” which has very materially changed\r\nits significance during the lapse of centuries. Galen, for example,\r\nemployed this word as a synonym of pharmakon--a simple remedial agent,\r\nand medical writers continued using the term in this sense during\r\nthe following thirteen or fourteen centuries. The word commonly\r\nemployed, by mediaeval physicians, to signify “pharmacopoeia,” was\r\n“antidotarium.” In modern times the word “antidote” signifies only an\r\nagent which neutralizes a poison.\r\n\r\nGalen took a very great interest in everything relating to the\r\nsubject of drugs, and sometimes made long journeys for the purpose\r\nof securing certain plants or roots which he was unable to procure\r\nnear home or which he was very anxious to obtain in a more perfect\r\ncondition than was possible when they were purchased from the regular\r\ndealers. “Simple remedies,” he declared, “are pure and unadulterated,\r\nand produce effects in only one direction. It is the business of\r\npharmacology to combine drugs in such a manner--according to their\r\nelementary qualities of heat, cold, moistness and dryness--as shall\r\nrender them effective in combating or overcoming the conditions which\r\nexist in the different diseases.” Galen’s interest in pharmacology\r\nmaterially aided the advance of medical science in other ways. He\r\nsystematized the existing knowledge of materia medica and infused some\r\nmeasure of orderliness into the therapeutics of his day. The success\r\nof his efforts in this direction did not become manifest until after\r\nhe had been dead about fifty years; but, if his ideas were slow in\r\nmeeting with general acceptance, they took such deep root in the minds\r\nof physicians that to-day in Persia Galen’s system of therapeutics is\r\nthe only one generally received as authoritative. Although the facts do\r\nnot warrant our making the same statement with regard to Western and\r\nSouthern Europe, it is nevertheless true that our dispensatories still\r\ncontinue to honor the memory of this great physician by bestowing the\r\nname of “Galenical Preparations” on a large group of pharmaceutical\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to state with any degree of positiveness at\r\nwhat date pharmacists, in the modern sense of the term, came to be\r\nrecognized as constituting a separate and honorable class in every\r\nwell-organized community. It is known, however, that in Syria and\r\nPersia, during the eighth and ninth centuries of the present era, not\r\na few of the leading physicians were the sons of apothecaries. Honein,\r\nfor example, of whose career I furnished a brief sketch in Chapter\r\nXIX., was the son of an apothecary; and the careful manner in which he\r\nwas educated during his youth justifies the belief that his father must\r\nhave been a man of some cultivation and not at all like the general\r\naverage of that class of men of whom Galen speaks so disparagingly. But\r\neven at that early period there certainly were individuals who were\r\nskilled in the pharmaceutic art, for Berendes (_op. cit._) tells\r\nus that Dioscorides (_circa_ 100 A. D.) describes minutely the\r\nmanner of preparing “Oisypum.” Oisypum is identical with the modern\r\n“Lanolin” or “Lanolinum,” and is a pure fat of wool. Mention is made of\r\nthe preparation by four different authors of medical treatises during\r\nthe following sixteen centuries--viz., by Aëtius in the sixth, by\r\nPaulus Aegineta in the seventh, by Nicolaus Myrepsus in the thirteenth,\r\nand by Valerius Cordus in the seventeenth. Subsequently to the latter\r\ndate no further mention of the preparation is to be found in any of\r\nthe pharmacopoeias except the French Codex of the year 1758, in which\r\nit is classed among the simple remedies under the title of “Oesipe.”\r\nFinally Liebreich, toward the end of the nineteenth century, brought\r\nthe preparation once more into favor under the name of “lanolin.” The\r\nfact that it remained in complete oblivion for such very long periods\r\nof time is easily explained by the statement which Berendes makes:\r\n“It was a troublesome ointment to manufacture, and consequently the\r\napothecaries disliked it and resorted to all sorts of falsifications.”\r\n\r\nWith the advance of the Arab Renaissance pharmacy gradually became a\r\nregular established occupation in every fairly large city in the East.\r\nIt is known, for example, that the first public apothecary shop in the\r\ncity of Bagdad was established during the eighth century of the present\r\nera under the caliphate of Almansur; and about the same time, probably\r\na little earlier, there existed at Djondisabour a similar pharmacy in\r\nconnection with the school and hospital of the Bakhtichou family. The\r\ntraining of an apothecary in those days was probably the same as that\r\nof the physician. Originally pharmacists were called “Szandalani,”\r\nprobably because they dealt largely in sandal wood.\r\n\r\nThe materia medica furnished by the Arab physician Rhazes in the\r\ndifferent works which he has written, is unusually rich in simple\r\nelements, the majority of which are always drugs of a rather mild\r\naction; Greece, Persia, Syria, East India and Egypt were the sources\r\nfrom which they were derived. Beside the simple elements, Rhazes\r\nmentions a number of composite preparations of drugs. As not a few\r\nof the latter required very careful manipulation, it may safely be\r\ninferred that the Arabian apothecaries of the ninth century had already\r\nacquired considerable skill and experience in their special field of\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nAt Salerno, during the first half of the twelfth century, pharmacy\r\nbegan to assume a position of considerable importance. The work\r\nwhich was prepared by Nicolaus Praepositus, and which was known as\r\nan “Antidotarium,” furnished quite full information with regard to\r\nthe characters and therapeutic uses of nearly 150 different drugs.\r\nAccording to Berendes this work served for several centuries as the\r\nbasis of later pharmacopoeias. One of its notable features is the\r\nimportance which the author attaches to the duty of weighing very\r\ncarefully each of the drugs that enter into the composition of a given\r\npreparation, of gathering certain vegetable products at the right\r\nseason, and of paying strict attention to their quality and to the\r\nmanner of preserving them.\r\n\r\nIn 1140 A. D., Roger, King of Naples and Sicily, promulgated a law\r\nwhich defined what should be the proper relations between physicians\r\nand apothecaries; and about one hundred years later (1241 A. D.)\r\nFrederick II. amplified and gave greater precision to this law, thus\r\nestablishing what was practically an Institute of Apothecaries. The\r\nfollowing provisions constitute the essential features of the law:--\r\n\r\n   1. The physician and the apothecary shall have no business\r\n   interests in common.\r\n\r\n   2. The physician shall not himself conduct an apothecary shop.\r\n\r\n   3. In each department of the kingdom two respectable men,\r\n   selected by the Faculty at Salerno, shall be assigned the duty\r\n   of furnishing sworn statements to the effect that all the\r\n   electuaries, syrups, and other preparations of drugs kept for\r\n   sale in a given apothecary shop, have been made according to the\r\n   established prescriptions and are offered for sale only in that\r\n   state.\r\n\r\n   4. In the case of those preparations which ordinarily do not\r\n   keep for a longer time than one year without spoiling, the price\r\n   at which they are to be sold shall be at the rate of 3 Tarreni\r\n   (about 30 cents) per ounce; while those which ordinarily remain\r\n   unchanged during a longer period, shall be valued at 6 Tarreni\r\n   per ounce.\r\n\r\nAt the time which we are now considering, it was not the custom, owing\r\nlargely to the expensiveness of writing paper, to deliver to the\r\npharmacist a written prescription. Instead, the physician first gave\r\nhis instructions in person, and then, after he had seen the mixing and\r\nother steps of the apothecary’s work properly performed, he carried the\r\npreparation to the patient’s house.\r\n\r\nLong before the middle of the fifteenth century apothecaries had become\r\nthoroughly well established throughout Central and Western Europe.\r\nAmong the statutes of the Medical Faculty of Erfurt, Germany, there has\r\nbeen found one which dates back to the year 1412 and which says:--\r\n\r\n   The student of medicine, before he applies for the Bachelor’s\r\n   Degree, should spend one month in the spring of the year, in an\r\n   apothecary’s establishment, in order that he may familiarize\r\n   himself with the proper manner of preparing clysters,\r\n   suppositories, pessaries, syrups, electuaries and other things\r\n   necessary for a physician to know.\r\n\r\nThe first work which was really worthy of being termed a treatise on\r\nmateria medica was published in 1447. It bore the title, “Compendium\r\nAromatariorum,” and was written by Saladin of Ascolo, the private\r\nphysician of Prince Antonio de Balza Ossino of Tarentum. Berendes says\r\nthat it was a work of much practical value.\r\n\r\n_The First Indications of the Beginning of Chemistry._--Up to a\r\ncomparatively recent date it has been customary to speak of Geber as\r\nthe first practical chemist and the first writer among the ancients\r\nwho appreciated the important part which chemistry was likely to take\r\nin medicine and philosophy at no distant period of time. But to-day,\r\nas appears from the researches made by M. Berthelot about 1893, we are\r\ncompelled to abandon the belief that such a person as Geber existed,\r\nand shall have to adopt the more commonplace view that the science\r\nof chemistry represents a gradual development from the much older\r\nalchemy. We may define the latter branch of knowledge as the science\r\nof transforming copper and brass into gold and silver. During the first\r\ntwo or three centuries of the Christian era there existed a firm belief\r\nthat such a transformation had actually been accomplished, and in\r\nconfirmation of the correctness of this statement it may be said that\r\nZosimos of Panopolis, one of the leading philosophers of Alexandria\r\nduring the fourth century of the present era, and a man who was\r\nconsidered by his contemporaries, as well as by all later alchemists,\r\nto be perhaps the greatest authority in this branch of knowledge,\r\nspeaks in unmistakable terms in his cyclopaedic work on alchemy (28\r\nvolumes), of a certain tincture which possesses the power of changing\r\nsilver into gold, and also of a “divine water” or fluid which is\r\ncapable of effecting many different transmutations. There can therefore\r\nbe no reasonable doubt that in the earlier centuries of the Middle Ages\r\nthe learned men of Alexandria accepted alchemy as a well-established\r\nagency of great power. From the sixth century to the thirteenth this\r\nscience was cultivated with great assiduity by the Arabs in the\r\nacademies which they established in Cordova and other cities of Spain;\r\nand it was from the latter region that the belief in alchemy spread to\r\nall the countries of Western Europe, gradually gaining strength up to\r\nperhaps the fifteenth century.\r\n\r\nIt was during the thirteenth century that the so-called “philosophers’\r\nstone” came to be considered the most effective agent in transmuting\r\nthe baser metals into silver and gold, and there were not a few who\r\neven believed that this as yet non-existent stone possessed the power\r\nto increase longevity, to confer health, and to give a prosperous\r\nissue to one’s undertakings. It was not the rabble, but the very\r\nbest and most highly educated men in the community who, during the\r\nthirteenth century, took the most active interest in alchemy and the\r\nphilosophers’ stone. Arnold of Villanova, Raymund Lullus, Roger Bacon,\r\nAlbertus Magnus, and, to a lesser degree, the famous theologian Thomas\r\nAquinas were all believers in the art of the magician. And even more\r\nextraordinary than this is the fact that in Germany men of this stamp\r\ncontinued for two or three centuries longer to cherish a belief in the\r\nreality of alchemistic processes. Even Martin Luther (1483–1546), the\r\ngreat reformer, did not hesitate to express his approval of “the black\r\nart,” as is shown by the following quotation from one of his writings:--\r\n\r\n   The art of alchemy is commendable and belongs in truth to\r\n   the philosophy of the ancient wise men, a fact which pleases\r\n   me greatly, not merely because of the intrinsic merits and\r\n   usefulness of the art in the matter of distillations of\r\n   vegetables and oily fluids and sublimation of metals, but also\r\n   because it serves as such a noble and beautiful symbol of the\r\n   resurrection of the dead at the last day of judgment. (Berendes.)\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated character who dabbled in the black art was Johannes\r\nFaust, who was born in 1485, obtained his degree of Bachelor of Arts at\r\nthe University of Heidelberg, and died in 1540 in Staufen in Breisgau.\r\nProfessor Scherer of Berlin says that “he was a great braggart, never\r\nfailed to create a sensation wherever he went, and had the conceit and\r\neffrontery to pass himself off as a scientist among the learned men of\r\nhis day. He called himself the philosopher of philosophers, a second\r\nMagus. He maintained that he was both a physician and an astrologer,\r\nand claimed that he could restore the dead to life, and could predict\r\nfuture events from a mere inspection of fire, air and water.”\r\n\r\nBut although the persistent and wonderfully energetic activities of\r\nthe alchemists failed to find the philosophers’ stone, or to transmute\r\nthe baser metals into silver and gold, they placed in the hands of man\r\nthe key to a knowledge of chemistry, that branch of science which was\r\ndestined in later years to play such an important part in pharmacy,\r\nin agriculture and in other industries. Thus we owe to alchemists the\r\ndiscovery of many processes and the invention of many apparatus which\r\nserve as the groundwork of modern chemistry. Some of the more important\r\nof these are the following: The use of the spirit lamp; the invention\r\nof tubular retorts; the production of potash and soda by burning\r\nthe hard deposit which collects in wine casks as well as various\r\nmarine plants; the oxidizing of certain metals (iron, lead, copper,\r\nquicksilver and antimony); the making of metallic arsenic, of wine of\r\nantimony, of sulphate of iron, of chloride of silver, of acetic acid\r\nand of many other chemical products; the purification of metals by the\r\nuse of lead, etc.\r\n\r\n_Supplementary Data Relating to Balneotherapeutics._--I have\r\nreferred to this subject on several occasions in the course of the\r\nearlier chapters of this history, but always without entering very much\r\ninto details. This policy was adopted, partly because the facts upon\r\nwhich a satisfactory sketch of the growth of balneotherapeutics might\r\nbe based were not very numerous, and partly because of the necessity of\r\ngaining space for more important matters.\r\n\r\nThe principal facts to which I made reference were: First, that before\r\nthe Christian era the employment of baths in a variety of different\r\nways for therapeutic purposes was universal in the East; and, second,\r\nthat in the city of Rome during the centuries immediately following the\r\nbirth of Christ, facilities for this kind of treatment were provided\r\non a most lavish scale--as in the baths of Agrippa (27 A. D.), of\r\nTitus (79 A. D.), of Caracalla (211 A. D.), and of Diocletian (302 A.\r\nD.). I may now add that the warm springs of Aachen (Aix-la-Chapelle),\r\nBaden-Baden and Wiesbaden, in Central Europe, and Bath, in England,\r\nwere known to the ancient Romans, and were utilized by them to some\r\nextent for therapeutic purposes; but it was not until a much later\r\nperiod that they and the less well-known springs of Schwalbach,\r\nDriburg, Warmbrunn, Goeppingen and Gastein began to be actively\r\nfrequented for remedial purposes. By the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury it had become a very popular thing for sufferers from all sorts\r\nof ailments to resort to these and other European springs. The history\r\nof the therapeutic employment of mineral waters belongs, however, to\r\nthe period of modern medicine rather than to that which I have been\r\nconsidering in the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               PART III\r\n\r\n                    MEDICINE DURING THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n    IMPORTANT EVENTS THAT PRECEDED THE RENAISSANCE--EARLY ATTEMPTS\r\n                       TO DISSECT THE HUMAN BODY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Important Events Immediately Preceding the Renaissance._--Three\r\nhundred years before the Christian era Erasistratus and Herophilus\r\nmade, at Alexandria, Egypt, an attempt to develop a correct knowledge\r\nof anatomy by means of dissections of human corpses, but the political\r\nand religious conditions at that time were not favorable to scientific\r\nwork, and therefore the success attained was of a very restricted\r\ncharacter. Then, during the succeeding three or four centuries, this\r\nearly movement gradually died out, and no further contributions to\r\nour knowledge of human anatomy were made until toward the end of the\r\nsecond century of the present era, at which time Claudius Galen, a\r\nman of giant intellect and tireless energy, did his best to supply\r\nthe anatomical knowledge so urgently needed. But the deeply rooted\r\nprejudices of that age against dissections of the human body lay like\r\nan insurmountable barrier across his path and forced him to confine his\r\nefforts to the dissection of those animals whose bodily construction\r\nresembled more or less closely that of man. Galen believed that the\r\nanatomy which he thus evolved for the guidance of his professional\r\nbrethren would satisfy all their legitimate wants of this nature,\r\nand he proceeded to build upon this faulty and unstable foundation\r\nan equally faulty physiology. History records the extraordinary fact\r\nthat Galen’s belief in the sufficiency of his anatomy and physiology\r\nfor all the reasonable needs of physicians and surgeons was so well\r\ngrounded that during the following thirteen or fourteen centuries\r\nnobody dared to cast the slightest suspicion upon the trustworthiness\r\nof these foundations of the science of medicine. Then followed, during\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, an awakening which seemed to\r\naffect all departments of human activity. This movement, which is\r\ncommonly termed the “Renaissance,” developed at first very slowly, and\r\nreached a noteworthy degree of momentum only toward the middle of the\r\nfifteenth century, about which time there occurred several events that\r\ncontributed greatly to strengthen and perpetuate the movement. Such\r\nwere, for example, the employment of gunpowder in the wars of Western\r\nEurope; the invention of a method of manufacturing paper--a discovery\r\nwhich led to the abandonment of the much more expensive parchment, and\r\nprepared the way for the invention of printing in its different forms;\r\nthe taking of Constantinople by the Turks in 1453; the discovery of\r\nAmerica in 1492; and, finally, the Reformation inaugurated by Martin\r\nLuther. Let us pass in review very briefly each of these events, in\r\norder that we may the better appreciate how the science of medicine,\r\nin the short space of time represented by a couple of centuries, made\r\na greater advance than it had previously made in the course of several\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nThe employment of gunpowder in warfare robbed the knight of the\r\nprotection which he had previously enjoyed from the wearing of metal\r\narmor, and thenceforward his life was as much imperiled in battle\r\nas was that of the foot-soldier, who was not permitted to protect\r\nhis person in this manner. Thus were the two upper classes of the\r\ncommunity, the nobles and the bourgeois, in any conflict which might\r\narise between them, placed more nearly upon a footing of equality. The\r\nultimate result showed itself in an increased importance, an increased\r\nprosperity, of the middle class or _bourgeoisie_, from which the\r\nphysicians chiefly came. Indeed, feudalism from this time forward\r\nrapidly ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of paper, an excellent and relatively cheap substitute\r\nfor parchment, facilitated wonderfully the spread of knowledge.\r\nParchment, the material upon which books were written, was expensive\r\nand was at times difficult to obtain; both of which circumstances\r\nrendered books so costly that only a few physicians were able to\r\nbecome the owners of the important standard medical works of that\r\nperiod--such, for example, as the Hippocratic writings, Galen’s\r\ntreatises, the surgical manuals of de Mondeville and Guy de Chauliac,\r\nthe pharmacopoeia of Dioscorides, and still other books of lesser\r\nvalue. And, if a satisfactory method of manufacturing paper had not\r\nfirst been discovered, the benefits growing out of the invention of\r\nprinting in 1467 would have been far less than they actually proved to\r\nbe. Some idea of the magnitude of these benefits may be formed from the\r\nfollowing statement of facts. The demand for books, after the invention\r\nof printing, became so great that the presses were kept almost\r\nconstantly busy. At first, according to the record furnished by Haeser,\r\nVenice and Rome took the lead in supplying this great demand for books;\r\nthe former city printing 2978 and the latter 972 volumes between the\r\nyears 1467 and 1560; but, during a later period (1500–1536), Paris\r\noutstripped Venice with a total of 3056 volumes, and Strassburg\r\nadvanced to the second place with a showing of 1021 volumes printed\r\nduring the same period of time. Thanks to the great diminution in the\r\nmarket price of books that resulted from the two inventions named--the\r\nmanufacture of paper and the introduction of printing--almost every\r\nphysician in fairly prosperous circumstances was able at that period\r\nto purchase the relatively few medical treatises which issued from the\r\npresses; and, besides, new authors were thenceforth stimulated to put\r\ntheir experiences into print.\r\n\r\nAmong the very first medical books printed the following deserve to be\r\nmentioned:--\r\n\r\n   (In Germany.) _Buch der Bündth-Erznei_, by Heinrich von\r\n   Volsprundt, 1460.--_Das buch der wund Artzeny. Handwirckung\r\n   der Cirurgia von Jyeronimo brunschwick_, 1508.--_Das\r\n   Feldtbuch der Wundtartzney_, by Hans von Gerssdorff, 1517.\r\n\r\n   (In Italy.) _Avicennae opera, arabice_, 1473.--_Guillelmi\r\n   de Saliceto cyrurgia_, 1475. (A French translation was\r\n   published at Lyons in 1492.)--_Celsi de medicina liber_,\r\n   etc., 1478.--_Guidonis de Cauliaco cyrurgia_, 1490. (A\r\n   French version was printed in Lyons in 1498.)\r\n\r\n   (In France.) _Christophori de Barzizus de febribum cognitione\r\n   et cura_, 1494.--_Bernard de Gourdon, traduction de son\r\n   “Lilium medicinae,”_ 1495.\r\n\r\nWhen Constantinople fell into the hands of the Turks in 1453, many of\r\nits Greek inhabitants, and particularly those belonging to the more\r\nhighly educated classes, fled to Western Europe in order to escape from\r\nthe tyranny of the invaders. Not a few of these refugees brought with\r\nthem to Italy and France copies of the works of the classical Greek\r\nauthors, and on this account, as well as because of their willingness\r\nto give instruction in their native tongue, they met with a cordial\r\nwelcome wherever they took up their new abodes. Their arrival in\r\nItaly happened at a most propitious time, for the interest in Greek\r\nliterature was at that period just beginning to develop among Italian\r\nscholars. Previously, Greek had been an almost unknown tongue in Italy.\r\nPetrarch, for example, is reported to have said in 1360 that he did\r\nnot know of ten educated men in that country who understood Greek; and\r\nthere is no evidence to show that the number of such men increased\r\nbetween 1360 and the time when the refugees from Constantinople\r\narrived. Many of the works of greatest importance to physicians--such,\r\nfor example, as the writings of Hippocrates, of Galen, of Rufus\r\nof Ephesus, of Oribasius, of Alexander of Tralles, and of several\r\nother classical medical authors of antiquity--were accessible (in\r\nthe original) only to those who were familiar with the Greek tongue.\r\nConsequently the arrival of these refugees from Constantinople\r\nconstituted a most important event in the history of European medicine.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of America by Christopher Columbus in 1492 owed its\r\norigin in part to the restless spirit of adventure which was abroad\r\nin Spain and Italy at that time, and also, in perhaps still larger\r\nmeasure, to the hope of gain which might be expected to follow the\r\ndiscovery of a shorter and more direct route to India. As regards the\r\nattainment of the latter object, the great explorer failed, but his\r\ndiscovery of a new continent resulted eventually in bringing great\r\nwealth to the rulers of Spain, in stimulating maritime commerce, and in\r\nbroadening men’s views with regard to every phase of human activity.\r\nThe addition of a few new drugs to the pharmacopoeia was a further\r\nresult of some importance. Luther’s efforts to reform the government\r\nand doctrines of the Church undoubtedly gave a great impetus to the\r\nRenaissance and therefore to the growth of the science of medicine.\r\nMen learned to use their reasoning powers with greater freedom, and as\r\na result our knowledge of the structure of the human body (anatomy)\r\nand of the working of its complicated machinery, both in health\r\n(physiology) and in disease (pathology), made astounding advances. And\r\nit is to the consideration of these fundamental branches of medical\r\nknowledge that we must now turn our attention.\r\n\r\n_Early Attempts to Dissect the Human Body._--Already as early as\r\nduring the first half of the fourteenth century physicians began to\r\nappreciate the fact that further progress in the knowledge of medicine\r\nwas not to be attained otherwise than by a more profound study of human\r\nanatomy than had been made up to that time; and they realized that it\r\nwas only by means of actual dissections that this more profound study\r\nmight be made. Various influences, however, co-operated to hinder such\r\nstudy. In the first place, the people at large were thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the idea that dissecting a human corpse was an act of desecration,\r\nand consequently it was by no means safe for a physician to do any\r\nwork of this character except in the most secret manner. Then, in\r\naddition, it was commonly believed-and this belief persisted even up to\r\na comparatively recent date--that the bull which Pope Boniface VIII.\r\nissued in 1300--and which declared that whoever dared to cut up a\r\nhuman body or to boil it, would fall under the ban of the church--was\r\nintended to cover dissections for purposes of anatomical study. The\r\nrecent investigations of Corradi, however, show (Haeser, p. 736 of the\r\nthird edition) that this bull was not intended to apply to dissections\r\nfor scientific purposes, but simply to put an end to the practice of\r\ncutting up human corpses and boiling the separate sections in order to\r\nobtain the bony framework in a condition suitable for transportation\r\nfrom Palestine to Europe,--a practice which had grown to be very common\r\namong the Crusaders.\r\n\r\nMondinus’ “Anatomy,” which was published in 1314, reveals the fact\r\nthat, during the early part of the fourteenth century, several private\r\ndissections were made. As might be expected, from the primitive\r\ncharacter of the illustrations that accompany the text of Mondinus’\r\nwork, these dissections were carried out in a very imperfect manner,\r\nfor--to mention only a single example--this author admits that he made\r\nno attempt to investigate the deeper structures of the ear, as such\r\nan examination would necessitate the employment of violent measures,\r\n“which would be a sinful act.”\r\n\r\nThe archives of the Bolognese School of Medicine contain an item which\r\nreveals the active interest taken in anatomy by the students of that\r\nday. It reads as follows: “At Bologna, in 1319, several of the Masters\r\nstole from a grave the corpse of a woman who had been buried two days\r\nbefore, and then turned it over to Master Albertus to dissect in the\r\npresence of a large number of students.” At the Medical School of\r\nMontpellier, in the south of France, the Faculty obtained permission\r\nin 1376 to dissect the corpse of an executed criminal once every\r\nyear; and the records show that the school actually availed itself of\r\nthis privilege in the years 1377, 1396 and 1446. Felix Platter, who\r\nafterward became one of the most distinguished physicians of Basel,\r\nSwitzerland, pursued his early medical studies at the latter university\r\nduring the years 1552–1557; and, in the diary which he faithfully\r\nkept during this period, he reveals in an interesting manner what\r\ndifficulties as well as dangers he experienced, first, in reaching\r\nMontpellier from his home in the eastern part of Switzerland, and,\r\nsecond, in obtaining greater opportunities for acquiring a genuine\r\nknowledge of anatomy than the school itself afforded in its official\r\ncourse. Although, owing to lack of space, I shall not be able to quote\r\nin full the appropriate portions of this most interesting narrative, I\r\nwill furnish an abridged English translation of the story as it appears\r\nin Platter’s journal or diary. In all its more important details the\r\naccount reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Our little party was composed of three persons, viz., Thomas\r\n   Schoepfius, the schoolmaster of St. Pierre; a Parisian by\r\n   the name of Robert who happened to be passing then through\r\n   Basel on his way to Geneva; and myself, a lad of sixteen. We\r\n   traveled on horseback and all three of us were armed with\r\n   rapiers. My outfit, which was handed to me by my father shortly\r\n   before our departure, consisted of two extra shirts and a few\r\n   pocket-handkerchiefs, wrapped up in a piece of waxed cloth.\r\n   In the matter of funds for the journey I received from my\r\n   father three crowns in silver and four gold pieces which,\r\n   for further security, he sewed into my vest. In addition,\r\n   he presented me with a rare piece of silver money which had\r\n   been issued by the Cardinal Mathieu Schiner, of the Canton de\r\n   Valais, who personally commanded the Swiss soldiers in their\r\n   successful combat with the troops of Louis the Twelfth, at\r\n   Marignan. It was a coin, therefore, which possessed considerable\r\n   historical value. My mother also bestowed upon me a gold coin (a\r\n   _couronne_). As a last injunction my father begged me not\r\n   to forget that, in order to procure the money which he had just\r\n   placed in my hands, as well as that which he had already paid\r\n   for my horse, he had been obliged to mortgage his property.\r\n\r\n   We left the city at nine o’clock on the morning of Oct. 10th,\r\n   1552, and at the same moment the news reached us that the Plague\r\n   had made its appearance in Basel. This was a most depressing\r\n   piece of intelligence, especially as we were already in great\r\n   fear that the army of the Emperor Charles the Fifth, which was\r\n   at that time on its way to the siege of Metz, would utterly\r\n   destroy our city.\r\n\r\n   We arrived at Berne early on the morning of Oct. 12th, and,\r\n   after leaving our horses at the inn, The Falcon, lost no time\r\n   in visiting the objects of interest in that ancient city, not\r\n   forgetting the bear pit, in which there were at that time six\r\n   of these creatures. In the afternoon we resumed our journey\r\n   toward Fribourg, and very soon overtook a newly married couple.\r\n   As they were traveling on horseback like ourselves, and were\r\n   following the same route for a certain distance, we all agreed\r\n   to keep together. While passing along a shady part of the road\r\n   the bride’s dress became so firmly entangled in the branches of\r\n   an apple tree that, failing to stop the horse, she was left\r\n   suspended in the air by her skirts. I immediately dismounted and\r\n   helped her to regain her feet, to adjust her disordered dress,\r\n   and to resume her seat in the saddle. On arriving at Fribourg\r\n   we put up at the inn called _La Croix Blanche_, and soon\r\n   discovered that almost everybody in the town spoke French, a\r\n   language with which Thomas and I, who were Germans, were not\r\n   familiar; but, thanks to our companion Robert, the Parisian, we\r\n   experienced no difficulty whatever in making all our wants known\r\n   and in securing all the information that we desired.\r\n\r\n   On the following day, Oct. 13th, it was raining hard when we\r\n   left Fribourg, and we were soon wet to the skin. After passing\r\n   through several small villages we stopped for refreshment at\r\n   an inn in the picturesque town of Romont, and at the same time\r\n   availed ourselves of the opportunity to have our clothes dried.\r\n   Then, having satisfied our appetites, we resumed our journey\r\n   in the direction of Lausanne; but we did not get very far on\r\n   our way before we discovered that Thomas had disappeared. We\r\n   were of course obliged to wait for him, and, by the time he had\r\n   rejoined the party, darkness and a thick fog combined to render\r\n   further progress very difficult, and we soon realized that we\r\n   had lost our way. We wandered up and down for some time without\r\n   encountering a barn or building of any kind in which we might\r\n   find shelter from the rain and secure a measure of protection\r\n   from the robbers who, according to common report, infested that\r\n   part of the country. Finally, however, we discovered a small\r\n   village; but, when we applied for a night’s lodging, not one\r\n   of the householders was willing to receive us. So we engaged\r\n   the services of a young peasant to act as our guide, and with\r\n   his assistance we finally reached a mean-looking inn in a\r\n   village called Mézières, which was composed of a few widely\r\n   scattered houses. We entered the tavern and found several\r\n   Savoyard peasants and some beggars seated at the long table of\r\n   the bar-room; they were engaged in eating roasted chestnuts and\r\n   black bread, which they washed down with copious draughts of a\r\n   liquor called _piquette_. They unceremoniously examined\r\n   our weapons and acted with great rudeness toward us in other\r\n   respects. The woman who kept the house said she had no other\r\n   room which she could place at our disposal, and our first\r\n   impulse therefore was to resume our journey immediately after we\r\n   had finished our meal of black bread and chestnuts; but, after\r\n   careful reflection, we came to the conclusion that such a course\r\n   might prove fraught with considerable danger. So we decided to\r\n   remain awake and watch for an opportunity to make our escape.\r\n   Very soon afterward these half-intoxicated men lay down on the\r\n   floor before the fire in the adjoining hall-way or vestibule\r\n   and fell into a sound sleep. Our guide then confessed to us\r\n   that, while at work in the stable, he had heard them planning\r\n   to waylay us on the highway at an early hour of the following\r\n   day. As soon, therefore, as we heard them all snoring lustily\r\n   we very quietly slipped out of the house. Our score having\r\n   already been paid earlier in the evening, and our horses having\r\n   been left saddled and bridled in the stable, we mounted and\r\n   took our departure by a road which led at first in a direction\r\n   different from that in which we were supposed to be traveling.\r\n   We experienced no further trouble on this part of our journey\r\n   and in due time reached Lausanne. When we told the people at the\r\n   inn about our experience at Mézières they replied that we might\r\n   consider ourselves most fortunate, as almost every day there\r\n   occurred, in the forest through which we had passed (_la Forêt\r\n   du Jorat_), a murder or some other deed of violence.[72] It\r\n   was plain, therefore, that we had had a narrow escape from death.\r\n\r\n   In the further course of our journey along the north shore\r\n   of the lake we reached the city of Geneva on Oct. 15th. When\r\n   I called upon John Calvin, to whom my father had given me a\r\n   letter of introduction, he said to me: “My Felix, you arrive at\r\n   the right moment, for I am now able to give you an excellent\r\n   traveling companion for the remainder of your journey--_to\r\n   wit_, Dr. Michel Heronard, a native of Montpellier.” This Dr.\r\n   Heronard, as I learned subsequently, was a Protestant who played\r\n   a prominent part in the religious disorders which, a few years\r\n   later, greatly disturbed the peace of that city.\r\n\r\n   On the 30th of October--just twenty days after we set out from\r\n   Basel--we entered the city of Montpellier, and I lost no time\r\n   in hunting up Laurent Catalan, the apothecary, at whose house I\r\n   expected to reside during my stay in that city.\r\n\r\nPlatter had now, after a long and dangerous journey, reached one of the\r\nthree greatest medical schools of that period, and it was his hope\r\nand expectation that he would here be able to acquire a correct and\r\nintimate knowledge of human anatomy. He was already aware that this\r\nknowledge could be satisfactorily obtained in only one way--that is,\r\nby dissecting the human body; and accordingly he availed himself of\r\nevery possible opportunity, during the five years which he spent at\r\nMontpellier, to accomplish this purpose. From the somewhat superficial\r\nexamination which I have made of the record furnished by the diary,\r\nit appears that only five or six official lessons or demonstrations\r\nwere given by the professor of anatomy during the period of time\r\nnamed; but--as every student of medicine knows--instruction of this\r\ncharacter is of relatively small value; and Platter himself seems to\r\nhave realized fully the truth of this statement, for during the second\r\nyear of his stay at Montpellier he joined a secret band of nocturnal\r\ngrave-robbers who were determined at all hazards to obtain the material\r\nneeded for self-instruction. The following brief description of one of\r\nthe raids made by this band of eager searchers after knowledge will\r\nconvey a good idea of the manner in which the work was conducted:--\r\n\r\n   Our first excursion of this kind was made on Dec. 11th, 1554. As\r\n   soon as it was really dark our fellow student Gallotus guided\r\n   us, along the road that leads to Nîmes, to the Augustinian\r\n   Monastery, which is situated about half-way between Castelnau\r\n   and the Verdanson brook. Here we were received by a monk called\r\n   Brother Bernard, a bold and determined fellow, who had disguised\r\n   himself for the business in hand. At midnight, after we had\r\n   partaken of food and drink, we started out, sword in hand, for\r\n   the cemetery which is located close to the church of Saint\r\n   Denis. Here we dug up with our hands a corpse which had been\r\n   interred that very day; and, having lifted it out of the pit by\r\n   means of ropes, and wrapped our cloaks around it, we carried the\r\n   body on two canes as far as Montpellier. Then, having concealed\r\n   our load close to the postern, alongside the city gateway, we\r\n   summoned the keeper and begged him to get us some wine, as\r\n   we were dying of thirst and very tired. While he was absent\r\n   in search of the wine three of our party slipped in through\r\n   the passage and carried the corpse safely to Gallotus’ house,\r\n   which was only a short distance from the gate. The gate-keeper\r\n   returned in due time with the wine, and did not appear to have\r\n   the slightest suspicion of the trick that we had played upon\r\n   him. It was now three o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe control exercised by the authorities over the practice of\r\ndissecting human corpses differed very appreciably at different dates\r\nin different parts of Europe. Thus, for example, orders were issued to\r\nthe Italian bishops during the latter part of the fourteenth century to\r\nput a stop to further dissections, and for a period of over one hundred\r\nyears these orders accomplished the purpose desired. On the other\r\nhand, the Emperor Charles the Fourth adopted a more liberal course:\r\nfrom the year 1348 on he permitted dissections of human corpses to be\r\nmade without hindrance in Prague, Bohemia, but his liberality in this\r\nparticular appears to have been of little use, for there is no evidence\r\nto show that the knowledge of anatomy made any appreciable advance\r\nanywhere in Europe until after the beginning of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nGabriel Zerbi of Verona (1468–1505) published at Venice in 1502 the\r\nfirst modern treatise on human anatomy that deserves to receive special\r\nmention. Pagel speaks of it as containing fairly good descriptions of\r\ndifferent parts of the body. Zerbi held the Chair of Medicine, Logic\r\nand Philosophy in the University of Padua, and lectured first in that\r\ncity, next at Bologna, and finally at Rome. One incident in his career\r\nmay prove of interest to the reader as showing the fearful risks to\r\nwhich a practicing physician in those days was sometimes exposed. The\r\nincident was of this nature:--\r\n\r\n   A wealthy pacha in Constantinople, failing to obtain relief from\r\n   his malady at the hands of the native Turkish doctors, summoned\r\n   an Italian physician from Venice. Zerbi, whom the ruling\r\n   Doge invited to accept the summons, sailed immediately for\r\n   Constantinople in company with his two sons who were mere lads.\r\n   The treatment which he inaugurated proved promptly successful,\r\n   and Zerbi, having been handsomely remunerated for his services,\r\n   was already on his way back to Venice when his ship was\r\n   overhauled by a swift-sailing caique on board of which were\r\n   the sons of his recent patient, who--as the story goes--had\r\n   celebrated his recovery by eating and drinking to excess.\r\n   This debauch promptly caused his death--probably by cerebral\r\n   apoplexy; but the sons were convinced that it was the result of\r\n   poison administered by Zerbi, and accordingly they lost no time\r\n   in starting out to capture the supposed murderer. Their first\r\n   act, on reaching the vessel which they were pursuing, was to\r\n   kill the younger of the two sons, in the presence of the father,\r\n   by sawing his body in two lengthwise. Then they killed Zerbi\r\n   himself in the same manner.\r\n\r\nTiraboschi, the first historian of Italian literature (1731–1794), is\r\nmentioned by Dezeimeris as his authority for this terrible tale. The\r\nevents here narrated occurred in 1505.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century--the period with which our\r\nhistory now has to deal--the only available knowledge of anatomy\r\nwas that which had been supplied by Galen in the third century of\r\nthe Christian era, and which had been handed down through all the\r\nintervening centuries as something absolutely correct and not to be\r\nchallenged. But the time had arrived when men were no longer willing\r\nto accept as truth the teachings of any individual until they had\r\nsubjected them afresh to the most searching investigations; and thus\r\nit came about that a group of remarkably able men devoted all their\r\nenergies, during the greater part of the sixteenth century, to a very\r\ncritical study of human anatomy. As the work accomplished by these\r\nmen constitutes a very important chapter--perhaps the most important\r\nchapter--in the history of medicine, I may be pardoned if I devote a\r\ndisproportionately large amount of space to the consideration of the\r\ncareers of the more prominent of these founders of modern anatomy, and\r\nto an enumeration of the details of the work which they accomplished,\r\nand which furnished the most complete verification of the truth stated\r\nby Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam (1561–1626), in the following words\r\n(_translation_):--\r\n\r\n   Man has no other means of getting at and revealing the truth\r\n   than by induction coupled with a never-tiring, unprejudiced\r\n   observation of nature and an imitation of her operations.\r\n   Actual facts must first be collected, and not created by a\r\n   process of speculation.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and most thorough students of human anatomy was\r\nMarc Antonio della Torre (1473–1506), who belonged to an honorable\r\nfamily of Verona, several members of which had attained distinction\r\nas physicians. He planned to publish a treatise on anatomy, and, with\r\nthis object in view, secured the assistance of Leonardo da Vinci\r\n(1452–1515), the celebrated painter, architect and civil engineer, to\r\nmake life-size pictures of the parts which he had dissected with such\r\ncare. But, after the latter had completed many of the drawings which\r\nwere intended to serve as illustrations for the projected treatise,\r\nDella Torre unexpectedly died, and the book was never finished. Quite\r\na number of the drawings, however, found their way to England, and for\r\nmany years past they have been carefully treasured at Windsor Castle\r\nand in certain private collections. If Della Torre’s life had been\r\nspared it is highly probable that his treatise on anatomy, equipped\r\nwith illustrations copied from this great artist’s drawings, would have\r\nconstituted a formidable rival of Vesalius’ famous work.\r\n\r\nNot long after this event it became the rule, among the leading\r\npainters and sculptors of the Renaissance period, to pay a great deal\r\nof attention to the study of human anatomy. The museums of Central and\r\nSouthern Italy contain quite a large number of anatomical drawings that\r\nwere made by Michael Angelo, by Raphael and by other great masters\r\nof that period. Doubtless many of my readers recall seeing, in the\r\nCathedral of Milan, Marco Agrate’s (1562) extraordinary masterpiece,\r\nin the form of a life-size black marble statue which represents Saint\r\nBartholomew standing erect, and carrying on one arm the folded skin of\r\nhis entire body. In this statue all the muscles and bony prominences\r\nare modeled with perfect accuracy. It is a remarkable work of art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n             THE FOUNDERS OF HUMAN ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest physicians of this period to inculcate the\r\nimportance of substituting a correct knowledge of anatomy for the\r\nfrequently incorrect descriptions that had been prepared by Galen and\r\nhanded down through the succeeding centuries, were the following:\r\nJacques DuBois of Paris (1478–1555), who was perhaps better known by\r\nhis latinized name of “Sylvius”; Guido Guidi (died in 1569), who was\r\nalso known as “Vidus Vidius”; and Winther of Andernach, a small city\r\non the Rhine. These three men, all of whom taught anatomy at Paris,\r\nwere commonly considered the best anatomists of that early period.\r\nDuBois was further entitled to the credit of having been the first\r\nphysician to inject blood-vessels with a material that renders them\r\nmore easily visible, and also the first person in Paris to dissect a\r\nhuman corpse. It was from these men that Vesalius, who afterward became\r\nsuch a famous anatomist, received his first practical instruction in\r\nthis branch of medical science. Nothing further need be said here of\r\nDuBois, but brief sketches of Guido Guidi and of Berengarius of Carpi,\r\nanother contemporary anatomist of considerable distinction, deserve to\r\nfind places in our history of this period. Vesalius’ facetious remark\r\nthat “Winther of Andernach never used a knife except for the purpose\r\nof dissecting his food” absolves us from the duty of saying anything\r\nfurther about his career as an anatomist.\r\n\r\nIn 1542 Francis the First, King of France, gave a great impulse to the\r\nstudy of medicine by calling Guido Guidi from Florence, Italy, to teach\r\nthat science in the _Collége de France_, an institution which\r\nhe had founded at Paris in 1530. Guidi, upon his arrival in Paris,\r\nwas at once most cordially received, both by those who were to be his\r\ncolleagues and by the King. Francis bestowed upon him a suitable gift,\r\nappointed him to the position of First Physician (Archiater) at his\r\nCourt, and assured him that he would receive an ample salary during\r\nhis residence in the French metropolis. In 1547, after the death of\r\nFrancis the First, Guidi returned to his home in Florence, where Cosimo\r\ndei Medici, at that time the head of the Florentine Republic and a\r\nlittle later Grand Duke of Tuscany (Cosimo III.), made him his First\r\nPhysician and gave him the appointment of Professor of Philosophy in\r\nthe University of Pisa. Not long afterward Guidi was transferred to the\r\nChair of Medicine. He retained this position almost up to the time of\r\nhis death (May 26, 1569), and during this long period Cosimo bestowed\r\nupon him various ecclesiastic honors, which not only increased his\r\nsocial rank but added materially to his financial resources.\r\n\r\nDezeimeris says that, while Guidi does not deserve to be placed, as\r\nan anatomist, in the same rank with Vesalius and Fallopius,[73] he\r\nmerits full credit for the very important service which he rendered the\r\nphysicians of his day by placing within their reach translations of\r\ncertain Greek treatises relating to surgical topics--such treatises,\r\nfor example, as those of Hippocrates on ulcers, on wounds of the\r\nhead, on the joints and on fractures (with Galen’s comments), Galen’s\r\ntreatise on fasciae, and that of Oribasius on ligatures and other\r\nsurgical contrivances.\r\n\r\nApart from his merits as a worker in the field of medical science,\r\nGuidi occupies a creditable place in the history of medicine as a\r\nfine type of the well-educated and kindly disposed physician, as the\r\nfollowing testimony given by Benvenuto Cellini, the distinguished\r\nFlorentine sculptor, shows:--\r\n\r\n   On the occasion of my visit to Paris I made the acquaintance\r\n   of Messer Guidi, and I wish to state in what a very friendly\r\n   manner I was received by that noble citizen of Florence and\r\n   excellent physician, the most virtuous, the most lovable, and\r\n   the most domestic man whom I have ever met.\r\n\r\nGuidi’s treatise on anatomy was first published at Venice (under the\r\neditorship of his nephew) in 1611--_i.e._, forty-two years after\r\nhis death. His translations from the Greek treatises of Hippocrates,\r\nGalen and Oribasius will be found in the work which bears the title\r\n“_Collectio Chirurgica Parisina_,” Paris, 1544.\r\n\r\nBerengarius of Carpi (a small town in Northern Italy), who died in\r\n1530, is pronounced by Kurt Sprengel a worthy predecessor of Vesalius.\r\nHe was Professor of Anatomy, first at Pavia and then at Bologna (from\r\n1502 to 1527), and he is reported to have dissected more than one\r\nhundred(!) cadavers during that period. Fallopius and Eustachius were\r\namong his pupils, and it was their opinion that he did more than\r\nanybody else to revive the interest in anatomical work. The famous\r\nsculptor, Benvenuto Cellini (1500–1571), is authority for the statement\r\nthat Berengarius was not only an experienced anatomist and practicing\r\nphysician, but also a very skilful draughtsman; the three works which\r\nhe published being illustrated with a certain number of original\r\nwoodcuts that are not without interest both to the anatomist and to the\r\nlover of art.\r\n\r\nAndreas Vesalius (1514–1564) was born at Brussels, of German parents\r\nwhose home was located at Wessels on the Rhine,--whence the name\r\n“Vesalius.” His father was the apothecary of the Princess Margaretha,\r\nCharles the Fifth’s aunt, and several of his ancestors had been\r\nphysicians of considerable distinction. At Louvain he received, in\r\nearly youth, a thorough training in the Latin, Greek and Arabic\r\nlanguages and also in mathematics. When he was about eighteen years\r\nof age, he visited Montpellier and afterward Paris, at which latter\r\ncity he received practical instruction in anatomy from the three\r\nmen whose names I have mentioned in the preceding paragraph--viz.,\r\nGuido Guidi, Jacques DuBois and Winther of Andernach. The instruction\r\nin anatomy given in Paris at that period (about 1533) consisted\r\nin interpretations of Galen’s teachings, in dissections of a few\r\nanimals, and in occasional demonstrations--which never lasted longer\r\nthan three days--of the easily accessible parts of a human cadaver.\r\nScanty as were these sources of information, Vesalius cultivated\r\nthem with the greatest zest. From time to time his teacher, DuBois,\r\nnoting the interest which his pupil took in anatomy, and recognizing\r\nhis fitness for imparting instruction, assigned to him the special\r\nduty of rehearsing, in the auditorium, before his fellow students,\r\nthe essential facts of the day’s lecture. After war had been declared\r\nbetween the Emperor Charles the Fifth and Francis the First, King of\r\nFrance, Vesalius left Paris and returned to Louvain, where he began\r\nlecturing on anatomy. These lectures constituted the very first attempt\r\nat anything like systematic instruction in anatomy that is known\r\nto have been made at that ancient university. It was while he was\r\nengaged in this work that Vesalius, in order to become the possessor\r\nof an entire human skeleton,--a thing of which he felt a very great\r\nneed,--ventured to remove from the gallows, outside the city, the\r\ncadaver of a criminal. This, as Haeser declares, was an act of great\r\nboldness and full of peril.\r\n\r\nThe life of a military surgeon attached to the army of Charles the\r\nFifth, which was the life that Vesalius led during the following year\r\nor two, was not sufficiently attractive to divert his mind seriously\r\nfrom his favorite study; and it is therefore not surprising that\r\nwe find him, at the age of twenty-three, accepting from the Senate\r\nat Venice the appointment of the professorship of anatomy at the\r\nUniversity of Padua. When he entered upon this new work Vesalius felt\r\nconsiderable uncertainty as to the correctness of the anatomy which\r\nhe was then teaching, and it is therefore easy to understand why his\r\nfirst three lectures were based entirely upon the teachings of Galen;\r\nbut, before he had finished the third one of the series, he made up his\r\nmind that he would cut loose from the anatomy of the ape and confine\r\nhimself to that of the human subject, as was then being revealed to\r\nhim more and more perfectly from his own dissections. The stock of\r\nknowledge which he had thus begun to accumulate, increased steadily\r\nuntil, after seven years of teaching at Padua, Bologna and Pisa, at\r\neach of which schools of medicine he gave courses in anatomy of seven\r\nweeks’ duration, and after conducting the most painstaking dissections\r\nof a number of human cadavers, he finally declared that he was ready to\r\npublish his great treatise on anatomy. Some of his friends, foreseeing\r\nclearly what a storm of protest the new book would arouse among the\r\nfollowers of Galen, urged him to postpone for a time its publication;\r\nbut a few others agreed with him that it should be issued without\r\nfurther delay. Accordingly Vesalius sent the manuscript of his work at\r\nonce to the printers at Basel, and the book was finally published in\r\nJune, 1543, before its author had attained his twenty-ninth year. Its\r\ntitle was “_De corporis humani fabrica_,” and it was provided with\r\nexceptionally fine pictorial illustrations, most of which were drawn,\r\nas is generally believed, by John de Calcar, one of Titian’s pupils. A\r\nsecond edition, superior in every respect to the first, was published\r\nin 1555. In comparison with this great work the few treatises written\r\nby Vesalius in later years are of minor importance.\r\n\r\nVesalius may rightly be considered the founder of modern anatomy,\r\nfor he was the first to furnish correct information, based on actual\r\ndissections of the human cadaver, respecting quite a large number of\r\nthe more important anatomical relations; and by this very act he won\r\nthe further credit of having dealt the first effective blow toward the\r\ndethronement of Galen, the man who, next to Hippocrates,--probably even\r\nmore than Hippocrates,--had exercised, by his teachings in nearly every\r\ndepartment of medical science, almost despotic sway over physicians\r\nfor considerably more than one thousand years. At this distance of\r\ntime, it is hard to realize what a startling effect was produced by the\r\nannouncement of the discovery of so many errors in Galen’s scheme of\r\nanatomy. Albert von Haller, the great authority on medical literature,\r\nspeaks of Vesalius’ book as an “immortal work”; and, although its title\r\nwould lead one to suppose that it deals only with the construction of\r\nthe human body, an examination of its contents reveals the fact that\r\nit contains in addition quite full information regarding physiology and\r\npathological anatomy, as well as many details relating to comparative\r\nanatomy. Perhaps the most marvelous thing about this book is the\r\nfact that its author completed his work before he had reached his\r\ntwenty-eighth year. It may also interest the reader to learn that,\r\nprior to 1914, the University of Louvain possessed a copy of Vesalius’\r\ngreat work printed on vellum and illustrated with many drawings in\r\ncolors; but I am unable to say whether this beautiful volume did or did\r\nnot escape destruction at the hands of the ruthless men who invaded\r\nBelgium during the summer of that memorable year.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 14. ANDREAS VESALIUS.\r\n\r\n  (After the portrait by Van Calcar in the Royal College of\r\n  Surgeons, London.)\r\n\r\n  Copied from the reproduction published in the _Nederlandsch\r\n  Tijdschrift voor Geneeskunde_, Jan. 2, 1915.]\r\n\r\nWhen the human mind has adjusted itself, in the course of years, to\r\nconsider certain beliefs and ideas as settled truths, it comes as a\r\npainful shock to be told that these beliefs are erroneous and that\r\nnew ones must take their places. This is precisely what happened when\r\nVesalius’ book was first published. From one end of Europe to the\r\nother there was a very great stir among the well-educated physicians;\r\nthe more liberal-minded being ready to accept at once the genuineness\r\nof the new anatomy, whereas others,--and possibly they represented\r\nthe larger number,--acting under the influence of personal jealousy\r\nor perhaps blinded by the belief that it was impious not to accept\r\nwithout questioning the descriptions made by Galen, were scandalized\r\nby the boldness of Vesalius in asserting that many of the statements\r\nmade by this great medical authority were incorrect. Jacques DuBois,\r\nwhose name has been mentioned by me on a previous page, was one of the\r\nmost bitter of Vesalius’ assailants. In a pamphlet which he published\r\nin Paris in 1551 he even went so far as to speak of his late pupil as\r\n“a crazy fool who is poisoning the air of Europe with his vaporings.”\r\nOn account of their former pleasant relations, and also because DuBois\r\nwas at that time an old man, Vesalius made no reply to these attacks;\r\nbut when Bartholomaeus Eustachius, Professor of Anatomy at Rome, one\r\nof the most celebrated anatomists of that period, and a man of his own\r\nage, entered the lists as the champion of Galen, Vesalius took up the\r\nchallenge, left the work upon which he was then engaged, and began a\r\ntour of visits to the universities of Padua, Bologna and Pisa, for the\r\nexpress purpose of disproving, by the aid of numerous dissections,\r\nthe statements made by his antagonists. Throughout this tour he was\r\nreceived everywhere with enthusiasm, the older men among the teachers\r\nof anatomy vying with the younger in manifesting the strength of their\r\napproval. The entire journey, says Haeser, was from beginning to end\r\na series of the most brilliant triumphs. But, notwithstanding this\r\nvindication, which most men would have accepted with the greatest\r\nsatisfaction, Vesalius returned to his home in Brussels only to find\r\nthat the bitter attacks made by his enemies had not ceased. This\r\ndepressed him greatly, for he was not philosophical enough to recognize\r\nthe facts that jealousy was at the bottom of this ill feeling toward\r\nhim, and also that sufficient time had not yet elapsed for the news\r\nof his triumphant vindication to travel from Italy to Belgium. While\r\nsuffering from this fit of the blues he committed to the flames all his\r\nbooks and manuscripts. These latter, it appears, contained not only\r\nthe fruits of many years of laborious anatomical and physiological\r\nresearch, but also a large number of memoranda relating to pathological\r\nanatomy.\r\n\r\nIn 1556, complaints having reached the ears of Charles the Fifth to\r\nthe effect that the sin of dissecting human corpses was greatly on the\r\nincrease, this monarch decided to refer the question to the Theological\r\nFaculty of the University of Salamanca, in the northwestern part of\r\nSpain, for an authoritative opinion. The reply which these broad-minded\r\ntheologians sent to the Emperor was most satisfactory. It is reported\r\nto have been expressed in the following words: “The dissection of\r\nhuman cadavers serves a useful purpose and is therefore permissible to\r\nChristians of the Catholic Church.” This decision did not of course\r\nput an immediate end to the harsh criticisms and petty persecutions of\r\nthe bigots; but, as the years went by, it was noted that the work of\r\nscientific research in human anatomy and physiology acquired greater\r\nfreedom of action, and it is fair to assume that this result was\r\nlargely due to the famous decision to which I have just referred.\r\n\r\nShortly after Vesalius had retired, as stated above, from active\r\nparticipation in anatomical research work, he was called by Charles the\r\nFifth to serve him in the capacity of private physician. During this\r\nservice, which lasted for several years, he visited, in company with\r\nthe Emperor, many of the principal cities of Europe; and then, when the\r\nlatter abdicated the throne of Spain,--for Charles was not only Emperor\r\nof the Holy Roman Empire but also King of Spain,--Vesalius became the\r\nprivate physician of Philip the Second, Charles’ son and successor on\r\nthe Spanish throne. This long period is largely a blank in the history\r\nof Vesalius. Toward the end he got into trouble with the Inquisition\r\nand was obliged, as a means of escaping the punishment of death, to\r\nundertake a voyage to the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. While he was\r\nin that city he received an official invitation from the Senate at\r\nVenice to fill the Chair of Anatomy at Padua. He then at once turned\r\nhis steps toward Italy, doubtless very happy over the prospect of once\r\nmore engaging in anatomical work; but he was shipwrecked on the coast\r\nof the Island of Zante, October 2, 1564. Thirteen days later, before he\r\nhad completed his fiftieth year, he died from starvation and exposure.\r\nA memorial tablet was placed in one of the neighboring churches on the\r\nisland, and in 1847 his Belgian compatriots erected a suitable monument\r\nto his memory in the city of Brussels.\r\n\r\nAdmirable as was Vesalius’ treatise on human anatomy, it was soon\r\ndiscovered that it was deficient in certain particulars. Not a few of\r\nthe descriptions, for example, were incomplete, and there were also a\r\nnumber of parts or organs for which no descriptions whatever had been\r\nprovided. Many of these deficiencies were supplied by contemporary\r\nanatomists, nearly all of whom were Italians. First and foremost among\r\nthis secondary but yet very important group of laborers in the field of\r\noriginal research work, the names of Fallopius and Eustachius deserve\r\nto be mentioned.\r\n\r\nGabriele Fallopius, who was born in Modena in 1523, was appointed to\r\nthe Chair of Anatomy at Ferrara when he was only twenty-four years\r\nof age. Subsequently he taught at the University of Pisa. At the\r\ntime of his death in 1563 he was Professor of Anatomy, Surgery and\r\nBotany at Padua. He made many important discoveries in anatomy, more\r\nparticularly in relation to foetal osteology and the distribution\r\nof the blood-vessels. His work in the latter department is all the\r\nmore remarkable from the fact that it was accomplished at a time when\r\nthe art of injecting blood-vessels with some opaque material was\r\nunknown in Italy. His name has been perpetuated in connection with\r\nthe Fallopian tube. As a man Fallopius was much liked because of his\r\nkindly disposition and absence of conceit. The only treatise which he\r\npublished was that entitled “_Observationes anatomicae_,” Venice,\r\n1561.\r\n\r\nBartholomaeus Eustachius, born at San Severino, in the Marches of\r\nAncona, in the early part of the sixteenth century, was one of the most\r\ndistinguished physicians of his day. He taught anatomy at the famous\r\nUniversity of Sapienza at Rome, and devoted a great deal of time and\r\nthought to the preparation of a large work which was to bear the title\r\n“On the Dissensions and Controversies Relating to Anatomy”; but death\r\novertook him before he had completed this undertaking. It appears,\r\nhowever, that in 1564--that is, ten years before he died--he published\r\na smaller work containing separate chapters on the kidneys, the organ\r\nof hearing, the movements of the head, the vena azygos, the vena\r\nprofunda of the arm, and on certain questions relating to osteology;\r\nand he introduced, as illustrations for the text, eight plates of\r\noctavo size. These plates and thirty-eight others, which were to have\r\nserved as illustrations for the great work, were all completed as early\r\nas during the year 1552. The artist Pini, who made the drawings that\r\nserved as the originals from which the plates were made, was related in\r\nsome degree to Eustachius, and upon the latter’s death the metal plates\r\nbecame his property by inheritance. But nothing further was heard of\r\nthem until they were discovered, early in the eighteenth century, by\r\nLancisi, the Pope’s attending physician, in the possession of Pini’s\r\ndescendants. They were published for the first time in 1714. Haeser\r\nsays that these pictures are true to nature, but that in artistic merit\r\nthey are not equal to those which belong to the treatise published by\r\nVesalius. The name Eustachius is permanently connected with the channel\r\nwhich leads from the tympanum to the nasal cavities--the Eustachian\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nOnly the briefest possible mention may here be made of those anatomists\r\nwho, following immediately in the footsteps of the three great leaders\r\nmentioned above, played parts of greater or less importance in building\r\nup the science of anatomy. Each one of them did creditable work in\r\ncorrecting the errors made by their predecessors or in supplying\r\ndescriptions of structures or structural relations which these pioneers\r\nhad overlooked. Thus, long before the sixteenth century came to an end,\r\nthe gross anatomy of the human being had attained a large measure of\r\nthe completeness which it possesses to-day. The names of some of the\r\nmore prominent men among those to whom I have just referred are the\r\nfollowing: Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia, Matthaeus Realdus Columbus,\r\nJulius Caesar Arantius, Constantius Varolius, Volcher Koyter and\r\nHieronymus Fabricius ab Acquapendente.\r\n\r\nIngrassia (1510–1580), a Sicilian physician, cultivated osteology\r\nassiduously, and is entitled to special credit for having first\r\ndescribed the stapes, the third one of the ossicles of hearing, and\r\nfor having made valuable contributions to our knowledge of epidemic\r\ndiseases. He was a professor in the University of Naples, and, after\r\nthe year 1563, held the position of Archiater in Palermo, Sicily. His\r\ndescriptions of the different bones of the skeleton were made with such\r\ncare and thoroughness that later anatomists found very little for them\r\nto discover or to alter.\r\n\r\nMatthaeus Realdus Columbus (or simply Realdus Columbus), who died in\r\n1559, was born in Cremona, Northern Italy. He served for some time as\r\nProsector to Vesalius at Padua, and then succeeded him in the Chair\r\nof Anatomy, first at Padua and afterward at Pisa. The last teaching\r\nposition which he held was that of Professor of Anatomy in Rome, in\r\nwhich city he counted Michael Angelo among his intimate friends.\r\nThe discoveries which he made in anatomy were quite numerous and of\r\nconsiderable importance, and his descriptions were distinguished by\r\nan unusual degree of accuracy and clearness. Unfortunately, he did\r\nnot hesitate, at the same time, to exalt the value of his own work by\r\ndisparaging that of his famous teacher.\r\n\r\nArantius, who also was one of the pupils of Vesalius, occupied the\r\nChair of Anatomy in his native city of Bologna during the latter half\r\nof the century. His death occurred in 1589. The particular department\r\nin which he gained considerable fame was that of the foetus, the\r\nplacenta, the uterus, etc. His descriptions of these structures are\r\nwritten with very great care. Blumenbach gives him credit for having\r\nbeen the first anatomist to furnish a description of the pregnant\r\nuterus in its different stages. His earliest published work bears the\r\ntitle “_De humano foetu opusculum_” Rome, 1564.\r\n\r\nConstantinus Varolius, whose name is imperishably connected with that\r\npart of the brain which is known as the “Pons Varolii,” was born in\r\nBologna in 1543. He was appointed Professor of Anatomy in the Academy\r\nof his native city at an early age, and soon distinguished himself by\r\nthe careful studies which he made of the human brain and nervous system\r\nin general. Before his untimely death at the age of thirty-two he was\r\nchosen the attending physician of Pope Gregory the Thirteenth. His\r\nearliest published work bears the title “_De nervis opticis, etc.,\r\nepistola_,” Padua, 1573.\r\n\r\nVolcher Koyter, who was born at Groningen, North Holland, in 1534,\r\nstudied under Fallopius and Guillaume Rondelet (1507–1566), to whom\r\nthe University of Montpellier was indebted for its anatomical theatre,\r\nand to whom (rather than to Gaspard Bauhin of Basel) is due the honor\r\nof discovering the ileo-caecal valve. Koyter was one of the earliest\r\nworkers in the field of comparative anatomy--a department of knowledge\r\nto which Vesalius had already made some creditable additions; and\r\nhis two most important published treatises bear these titles: “_De\r\nossibus et cartilaginibus corporis humani tabulae_” (Bologna, 1566),\r\nand “_Externarum et internarum principalium humani corporis partium\r\ntabulae_” (Nuremberg, 1573). He died in 1600.\r\n\r\nHieronymus Fabricius was born in 1537 at Acquapendente, a small city\r\nof Etruria, about fifty miles northwest of Rome. He studied anatomy\r\nat Padua under Fallopius, and, after the latter’s death, was assigned\r\nto the duty of making the necessary dissections and anatomical\r\ndemonstrations before the class. In 1565 he was appointed Professor\r\nof Surgery, with the understanding that he was to continue giving his\r\ndemonstrations in anatomy. The salary which he received for this double\r\nwork was 100 ducats, but it was increased from time to time until\r\nfinally he was paid 1100 ducats yearly. At the end of thirty-six years\r\nhe was retired upon a pension of 1000 ducats for the remainder of his\r\nlife, and was allowed the privilege of appointing his successor in the\r\nChair of Surgery. He gave the place to Julius Casserius in 1609. To\r\ndistinguish him from another Fabricius, who gained great distinction in\r\nthe field of surgery, it has always been customary for later historical\r\nwriters to speak of him as “Fabricius ab Acquapendente.” His namesake\r\nis known as “Fabricius Hildanus.”\r\n\r\nAs a teacher of anatomy, especially in its relations to physiology,\r\nFabricius was held in the highest esteem. Albert von Haller speaks of\r\nhim as being one of the glories of the Italian school of medicine.\r\nPupils came in flocks from all parts of Europe to attend his lectures,\r\nand among them were some who, like William Harvey of England, afterward\r\nattained great celebrity for the effective work which they did in\r\nadvancing the science of medicine. One of the attractive features of\r\nFabricius’ teaching was to be found in his practice--something quite\r\nnew at that period--of showing to the students, not only the particular\r\norgan (human) upon which he happened then to be lecturing, but also\r\nthe corresponding organ in one or several of the animals; thus enabling\r\nthem to learn what were the features possessed in common by all the\r\nspecies, and what were those in respect of which the species differed.\r\nAs time went on, the number of those who came to witness his anatomical\r\ndemonstrations increased so greatly that he felt impelled to build,\r\nat his own expense, a new and larger amphitheatre. But even this, in\r\na short time, proved to be too small, and then the Senate at Venice,\r\nwhich exercised a governing control over the University of Padua,\r\nerected (in 1593) a much larger and more complete amphitheatre, upon\r\nthe walls of which there was placed an inscription stating that it had\r\nbeen built in honor of Fabricius. Among the other distinctions which\r\nwere conferred upon him at this time he was raised to the rank of\r\nKnight of the Order of Saint Mark and made an honorary citizen of Padua.\r\n\r\nFabricius ab Acquapendente added to our stock of anatomical knowledge\r\nby his researches on the structure of the oesophagus, stomach and\r\nintestines, the eye, ear, larynx and foetus. One of his chief claims to\r\ndistinction, however, rests upon the fact that he wrote an elaborate\r\nmonograph on the valves of the veins. Although these structures had\r\nbeen seen and described at an earlier date by Charles Estienne,\r\nBerengarius, Vesalius, Cannani and others (Fra Paolo Sarpi, for\r\nexample), nobody had yet offered a satisfactory explanation of their\r\nprobable use or had traced them through the venous system at large.\r\nIn 1574 Fabricius demonstrated their presence in all the veins of the\r\nextremities.\r\n\r\nBut Fabricius ab Acquapendente was not merely a good anatomist and\r\nphysiologist; he was also a most distinguished surgeon and general\r\npractitioner. From far and from near patients came to consult him\r\nabout their ailments, and he appears to have been immensely popular\r\namong all classes of the community. His home, situated on the River\r\nBrenta, just outside the city of Padua, was most attractive, and it was\r\nthere that he dispensed hospitality in a princely fashion. One of his\r\npeculiarities was that in many cases he was unwilling to accept a fee\r\nfor his services. As a natural result, gifts of all sorts, many of them\r\nof considerable value, were showered upon him. He devoted one of the\r\nrooms of his residence to the purposes of a cabinet or museum, in which\r\nall those gifts which were suited to such display might be properly\r\nexposed to view, and over the doorway of the room he placed this\r\ninscription, “_Lucri neglecti lucrum_,” which I venture to render\r\ninto English by the following, “Costly gifts representing unproductive\r\nwealth.”[74]\r\n\r\nFabricius remained a bachelor all his life, and at the time of his\r\ndeath (May 21, 1619, at the age of eighty-two) his fortune, which he\r\nbequeathed to his brother’s daughter, amounted to 200,000 ducats--a\r\nvery large sum in those days.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Fabricius were published at Leipzig in a single volume\r\nin 1687, but Johann Bohn, who edited the collection, omitted the\r\ndifferent prefaces which Fabricius had written. In the Leyden edition\r\nof 1737 this defect has been remedied.\r\n\r\nTo furnish here even a much abbreviated account of the important\r\ndiscoveries made in anatomy and physiology during the sixteenth century\r\nwould call for a much larger amount of space than can possibly be given\r\nto these two branches of medical science. Our modern text books on the\r\nsubject of anatomy alone are, in a certain sense, catalogues of these\r\nvery discoveries, and every physician knows what a vast amount of space\r\nthey occupy. I have already made mention of a few of these discoveries,\r\nand, when I come to consider the splendid work done by William Harvey\r\nin the early part of the seventeenth century, I shall have occasion\r\nto recapitulate briefly the more important discoveries made by his\r\npredecessors in this particular field. In this way I shall be able to\r\nsupply information regarding several of the discoveries which I am now\r\nobliged to pass over in silence, but which, under other circumstances,\r\nwould more properly receive consideration in the present chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n      FURTHER DETAILS CONCERNING THE ADVANCE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF\r\n      ANATOMY--DISSECTING MADE A PART OF THE REGULAR TRAINING OF\r\n       A MEDICAL STUDENT--IATROCHEMISTS AND IATROPHYSICISTS--THE\r\n    EMPLOYMENT OF LATIN IN LECTURING AND WRITING ON MEDICAL TOPICS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Further Details Concerning the Advance in Our Knowledge of Gross\r\nAnatomy._--In the preceding chapter I have given some account of\r\nthe efforts made during the sixteenth century by certain physicians\r\nto lay solidly the foundations of a gross anatomy of the human body.\r\nThe time was ripe for such a movement, and the right sort of men took\r\ncharge of it and pushed it forward to such a stage of successful\r\naccomplishment that we physicians of to-day are able to continue in\r\nthe direction indicated, and under the impulse communicated, by these\r\nmaster builders. These men, it should be remembered, did something more\r\nthan merely to lay solid and durable foundations in the form of an\r\naccurate anatomy, they also taught the correct methods of procedure for\r\nthe erection of the superstructure of the science of medicine.\r\n\r\nUp to the end of the sixteenth century almost all the work done in\r\nanatomy was effected with the aid of the scalpel alone, the object\r\nbeing to isolate and expose clearly to view the larger tissues and\r\norgans, such as muscles, arteries, veins, nerves, etc. In a very few\r\ninstances more elaborate methods were devised, even as early as during\r\nthe fifteenth century, by men of exceptional cleverness. Thus, for\r\nexample, in 1490, Alexander Benedetti, Professor of Anatomy at Padua,\r\ninvented a method of preserving muscles, nerves and blood-vessels as\r\npermanent dry specimens, and it is said that he sold such preparations\r\nfor large sums of money. As already stated on a previous page, the\r\ninjection of blood-vessels with certain fluids was also employed to a\r\nvery limited extent at this early period as a means of distinguishing\r\nthem more easily from the surrounding structures; but this practice\r\ngave place, during the seventeenth century, to the better method of\r\nemploying, as an injecting material, a semi-fluid preparation which\r\nbecame quite solid soon after it had penetrated well into the interior\r\nof the vessels, and to which any desired opaque color might be given.\r\nThis method was invented by the Hollander, John Swammerdam (1627–1680)\r\nand perfected by Van Horne. It was largely by the employment of this\r\nprocedure that Friedrich Ruysch of Amsterdam (1638–1731), Professor\r\nof Anatomy and Botany in the university of his native city, gained\r\nsuch celebrity throughout Europe for the great beauty of his permanent\r\nanatomical preparations. Hyrtl mentions the fact that Peter the Great\r\nof Russia, who resided for a certain length of time at Zaandam, near\r\nAmsterdam, in order that he might familiarize himself with the art of\r\nship-building, was in the habit of visiting Ruysch from time to time\r\nin his museum and laboratory; and finally (in 1717) bought from him,\r\nfor the sum of 30,000 florins, his entire collection of specimens,\r\ntogether with the formula of the mixture which he employed in making\r\nhis injections. The collection itself, it should be stated, contained\r\nnot only specimens illustrative of normal human anatomy (_e.g._,\r\nthe various solid and hollow organs, the organs of special sense,\r\nand objects belonging to the vascular, muscular, nervous and osseous\r\nsystems), but also many specimens illustrating pathological and\r\ncomparative anatomy, and a great variety of monstrosities.\r\n\r\nRuysch also attained remarkable success in restoring the rosy color\r\nand soft flexibility of the skin and the natural facial expression\r\nin certain dead bodies by the employment of a preservative fluid\r\nwidely known as “_Liquor balsamicus_.” Tradition says that in one\r\ninstance, that of a child whose corpse had been treated in this manner\r\nby Ruysch, the face presented such a perfectly life-like appearance\r\nthat the Czar, as he passed near the object, thought he was looking\r\nupon a sleeping child and gave it a kiss.\r\n\r\nThe aged professor lived to be ninety-three, and continued giving his\r\nlectures on anatomy almost up to the day of his death, which resulted\r\nfrom accidental injuries. When it became clear that these were of so\r\nserious a nature that he could not possibly recover, he asked to be\r\ncarried on a stretcher into the assembly room in order that he might\r\nsay a farewell to the students who had been attending his lectures.\r\n\r\nAlthough some critics have intimated that Ruysch should be ranked\r\nmerely as a very clever mechanic in the domain of anatomy, there are\r\ncertain well-established facts which show that this estimate of the man\r\nis unfair. It is known, for example, that he was the first anatomist\r\nto call attention to the features which distinguish the male from the\r\nfemale skeleton (_e.g._, the differences in the form of the pelvis\r\nand of the thorax). Ruysch also advanced our knowledge of the vascular\r\nsystem by means of the improvements which he effected in the method of\r\ninjecting blood-vessels. His skill in this special work was so great\r\nthat people were wont to say of him that he possessed the fingers of\r\na fairy and the eyes of a lynx. It was Ruysch too who furnished the\r\nfirst descriptions of the bronchial blood-vessels and of the vascular\r\nplexuses of the heart. Finally, the term “_membrana Ruyschiana_,”\r\nin connection with the choroid of the eye, bears testimony to the fact\r\nthat he was also an original worker in this very difficult corner of\r\nthe field of human anatomy.\r\n\r\nThe crowning event in the life of Ruysch--an event which shows\r\nhow wasteful many of us men are of our productive powers when we\r\ndeliberately retire from all participation in active work, physical or\r\nmental, at the comparatively early age of sixty-five--occurred in 1717,\r\nwhen he had attained the age of seventy-nine. Peter the Great had\r\nhardly left the premises with the great collection of specimens for\r\nwhich he had paid such a fabulous price, when Ruysch began the making\r\nof a new collection; and at this task he worked so diligently that in\r\nless than ten years he was able to deliver to John Sobieski, King of\r\nPoland, the greater part of the new collection (for which he received\r\nthe sum of 20,000 florins). Then followed a period of about three years\r\nduring which he continued active work as a teacher of anatomy, death\r\nalone seeming to possess the power to arrest his extraordinary energy.\r\n\r\nRuysch’s only published works are the following: Catalogue of the\r\nSpecimens contained in his Museum, Amsterdam, 1691; and a _Thesaurus\r\nAnatomicus_, in 10 volumes, Amsterdam, 1701–1715.\r\n\r\nIn reading over the account which I have given of the discoveries\r\nmade in gross anatomy and in physiology during the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries, I find that I have omitted some that may just as\r\nappropriately be mentioned in this section as in that which I intend to\r\ndevote to work done in the domain of minute anatomy. I shall therefore\r\nrefer to them briefly now, and then pass on to the consideration of the\r\nlatter branch of my subject.\r\n\r\nEustachius, the famous Italian anatomist, deserves special credit\r\nfor the experimental methods which he devised and employed in his\r\nefforts to gain a better knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of\r\nthe kidneys. Moritz Hofmann of Fürstenwald discovered in 1641, in the\r\nturkey gobbler, the outlet duct of the pancreas, and a short time\r\nafterward George Wirsung, a Bavarian, discovered the same structure in\r\nthe human being. Then, in 1651, Olaus Rudbeck, Professor of Anatomy\r\nin the University of Upsala, Sweden, discovered the lymphatics of\r\nthe intestines, and established (at a later date) the fact that they\r\nare a separate system from that of the chyle ducts. Francis Glisson\r\n(1597–1677) of Cambridge University, England, one of Harvey’s pupils,\r\nmade two series of anatomical investigations of a most creditable\r\ncharacter--the first concerning the relationship which exists\r\nbetween the intestinal lymphatics and the alimentary canal, and the\r\nsecond regarding the internal construction of the liver (“capsule of\r\nGlisson”). Thomas Wharton (1610–1673), a native of Yorkshire, England,\r\nand a London practitioner of medicine, discovered the outlet channel\r\nof the submaxillary salivary gland, now known as “Wharton’s duct,”\r\nand he also published the first exhaustive treatise on the structure\r\nof glands in general (thymus, pancreas, submaxillary, etc.). About\r\nthe middle of the seventeenth century Nathanael Highmore of Oxford,\r\nEngland (1613–1685), discovered and adequately described the cavity\r\nin the superior maxilla which bears his name (“antrum of Highmore”),\r\nand which in comparatively recent years has assumed such importance\r\nfrom the viewpoint of the practical surgeon. A Danish anatomist,\r\nwho is known to us English-speaking physicians as Nicholas Steno\r\n(1638–1686), but to his own countrymen as Niels Stensen, discovered\r\nthe outlet duct of the parotid gland (“Steno’s duct”). Stephen\r\nBlancaard (1650–1702), a practicing physician of Amsterdam, made the\r\nfirst successful injections of capillary blood-vessels; and Domenico\r\nde Marchettis (1626–1688), Professor in the University of Padua,\r\nemploying Blancaard’s technique, succeeded in proving that the finest\r\nramifications of both veins and arteries communicate the one with the\r\nother. To Conrad Victor Schneider, a professor at the University of\r\nWittenberg, Germany (1614–1680), we are indebted for putting an end\r\nforever to the erroneous doctrine that the nasal mucus is produced\r\nin the brain. He did not, however, have the good fortune to discover\r\nthe glands from which this mucus actually comes; the credit for\r\nthis discovery being due to Niels Stensen. Among the host of other\r\nsuccessful discoverers in the domain of anatomy during the seventeenth\r\ncentury the following men deserve at least to be mentioned by name:\r\nJohann Conrad Peyer (1653–1712) of Schaffhausen, Switzerland; Johann\r\nConrad Brunner (1653–1727), also a native of Switzerland; Theodor\r\nKerckring (1640–1693) of Hamburg, Germany; Anton Nuck (1650–1692),\r\nProfessor of Anatomy at the University of Leyden, Holland; Reignier\r\nde Graaf (1641–1673), a native of the Netherlands; and Thomas Willis\r\n(1622–1675) and William Cowper (1666–1709), both of them Englishmen.\r\n\r\nAnd, finally, it may be stated that all the leading anatomists of the\r\nsixteenth century devoted a great deal of time to the study of the\r\nmanner in which the nerves are distributed throughout the body and\r\nto ascertaining the arrangement of the intracranial and intraspinal\r\nnervous structures. To give even the most superficial account of what\r\nthese men accomplished would occupy far more space than can well be\r\nspared for this purpose. Kurt Sprengel is my authority for saying\r\nthat, of all the workers in this particular field during the period in\r\nquestion, Fallopius is entitled to receive the greatest credit for what\r\nhe accomplished.\r\n\r\n_The First Beginnings of Minute or Microscopic Anatomy._--The\r\nanatomy of the tissues--microscopic anatomy--begins with Marcello\r\nMalpighi (1628–1694), a native of Crevalcuore, near Bologna, Italy.\r\nIt is not positively known who was the inventor of the compound\r\nmicroscope. First employed about the year 1620, the instruments of this\r\ntype came into fairly general use toward the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. But the early compound microscopes were not very satisfactory,\r\nand consequently preference was given, for a long time, to those of\r\nthe simple type. Achromatic instruments were not purchasable until\r\n1780, when the famous German physicist, Leonhard Euler, succeeded in\r\novercoming the obstacles which had up to that time stood in the way of\r\ntheir successful manufacture.\r\n\r\nIn 1661 Malpighi, who was in the habit of manufacturing his own\r\nmicroscopes, was able, by aid of one of these instruments, to exhibit\r\nthe blood, loaded with its corpuscular bodies, passing rapidly from\r\none capillary vessel to another in the frog’s lung. Then in 1683\r\nGuillaume Molyneux, in 1690 Anton van Leeuwenhoek, and in 1697 William\r\nCowper, witnessed the same phenomenon in warm-blooded animals. Among\r\nthe other anatomists of this period who contributed in varying degrees\r\nto our knowledge of the minute anatomy of the different tissues and\r\norgans the following deserve to be mentioned: J. Riolan (1577–1657),\r\nBoselli of Naples (1608–1679), Lower of Oxford, England (1631–1691),\r\nVesling of Minden, Germany (1598–1649), Regnier de Graaf of Delft,\r\nHolland (1641–1673), who gained so great distinction by his accurate\r\ndescription of the ovarian follicles (“Graafian follicles”); and\r\nJames Douglas (1676–1742), the English anatomist, who ascertained and\r\ndescribed the precise limits of the peritoneum.\r\n\r\nOf all the men whom I have mentioned above, Malpighi and Leeuwenhoek\r\nare probably the best known to our readers for the large number\r\nand important character of the contributions which they made to\r\nmicroscopic anatomy. The list of Malpighi’s achievements, for example,\r\nincludes the following, in addition to the demonstration of the blood\r\nin actual circulation, as already mentioned: contributions to our\r\nknowledge of the finer structure of plants; the demonstration of\r\nthe minute anatomy of the skin (“_rete mucosum_” or “_rete\r\nMalpighi_”); the amplification of our knowledge of the structure\r\nof the teeth; the discovery that the lungs are composed to a large\r\nextent of terminal vesicles, the walls of which are richly supplied\r\nwith blood-channels.; the demonstration that certain glands possess\r\nan acinous structure (_i.e._, an outlet channel springing from\r\nnumerous small sacs, the whole group resembling a cluster of grapes);\r\nmore complete details regarding the structure of the spleen and\r\nthe kidneys (“Malpighian bodies or corpuscles”); additions to our\r\nknowledge of the structure of the white and the gray substances of\r\nthe brain and the demonstration that fibres from the spinal cord pass\r\non into the brain; the declaration that the papillae of the tongue\r\nare organs of taste and the papillae of the skin are organs of the\r\nsense of touch; and not a few other contributions of greater or less\r\nimportance. During his long life Anton Leeuwenhoek (1632–1723) of\r\nDelft, Holland, made a great many additions to microscopic anatomy,\r\nsome of the more important of which are the following: he was the\r\nfirst to discover and to describe the many varieties of Infusoria\r\n(the animalcules found in stagnant collections of water); to him is\r\nalso due the credit of first observing the faceted arrangement in\r\nthe eyes of insects; he made original investigations into the origin\r\nand mode of development of several species of the lower organisms; he\r\nwas the first to observe the canaliculated mode of construction in\r\nbone, and he also noted the existence of the so-called bone-corpuscles\r\n(afterward rediscovered and more accurately described by Purkinje); he\r\ndiscovered the striated condition of the bundles of muscular fibres,\r\nand was also the first person to teach the doctrine that the growth\r\nof muscles is effected by an enlargement of the primitive bundles of\r\nfibres and not by a multiplication of these structures; he taught\r\nfurther that muscle-substance consists of numberless small spheres; he\r\nwas the first to describe the crystalline lens as a structure composed\r\nof fibres which are arranged in layers or sheets; in association with\r\nGuillaume Molyneux he studied, under the microscope, the speed with\r\nwhich the blood-current travels in the blood-vessels; he made valuable\r\nobservations on the nature of the spermatozoa; and, finally, the very\r\nfirst studies in bacteriology appear to have been made by Leeuwenhoek.\r\nAs a result of his discovery of “round, rod-shaped, thread-like and\r\ncorkscrew-shaped bacteria” between the teeth of a human being, the\r\ntheory was set forth that probably many diseases owe their origin to\r\nsuch “little animals.”[75]\r\n\r\nThe same idea, as will be shown farther on, occurred to the\r\ndistinguished medical practitioner of Verona, Italy,--viz.,\r\nFracastoro,--one hundred years earlier (1546). Leeuwenhoek, it should\r\nhere be stated, possessed a very great advantage over his rivals in\r\nthe field of minute anatomy, for he was in the habit of using, in\r\nhis investigations, microscopes which he himself had made, and which\r\nmagnified from 160 to 270 diameters, whereas those utilized by the\r\nothers were capable of magnifying, at the maximum, only 143 diameters.\r\nWhile a large part of the work which he performed shows plainly that\r\nhe was a skilful and careful anatomist and endowed with good mental\r\npowers, Leeuwenhoek nevertheless manifested certain mean traits of\r\ncharacter. Daremberg says that these “consisted in his disposition\r\nto conceal his technical methods from his associates, and in his\r\njealousy of others--as manifested, for example, toward Leibnitz, who\r\nhad established a similar laboratory for research work in minute\r\nanatomy. These traits of character showed that fundamentally he was\r\nnot a true lover of science, but rather an artisan. And yet, with all\r\nthese faults, he does not appear to have placed an inordinately high\r\nvalue upon his discoveries or to have been unreasonably sure of the\r\ncorrectness of his conclusions.” The first monograph published by\r\nLeeuwenhoek bears the date 1673. It is a study of the minute anatomy\r\nof the bee’s sting. He was the first to declare that the blood is the\r\nnutritive fluid _par excellence_, and that it is to be found in\r\nthe entire series of organisms belonging to the animal kingdom. He\r\ndivided blood into two parts--the red, or the solid portion, and the\r\nserum. The corpuscles which float in the serum and give to the whole\r\nfluid its red color, are called by him “particles,” in the case of\r\nblood from birds, reptiles and fishes, and “globules” in that from\r\nquadrupeds. He employed this term “globules” because he believed that\r\nthese bodies were exactly spherical in shape. According to Daremberg,\r\nLeeuwenhoek’s studies cover the entire field of human histology, and\r\nhis findings are for the most part correct.\r\n\r\n_The Founding of Organizations for the Advancement of Medical\r\nScience._--During the seventeenth century there were formed a number\r\nof associations which had for their object the promotion of scientific\r\nknowledge, and these organizations contributed greatly to stimulate\r\noriginal researches in anatomy and physiology and to secure accuracy in\r\nthe published results. Perhaps the most important institution of this\r\nkind was the French _Académie des sciences_, which was founded in\r\n1666, and which deserves the credit of having taken a very important\r\npart in the perfecting of our knowledge of anatomy and physiology.\r\nThe Royal Society of London, founded in 1645, possesses a splendid\r\nrecord of valuable work accomplished. The following organizations also\r\ndeserve to be honorably mentioned in this place: the _Accademia dei\r\nLincei_ at Rome, founded in 1603; the _Académie des Curieux de\r\nla Nature_, 1652; and the _Accademia del Cimento_, founded at\r\nFlorence in 1657. New universities were also founded in Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half of the seventeenth century there were three\r\nFrench physicians who deserve credit for the excellence of the work\r\nwhich they did in the departments of anatomy and physiology, viz.,\r\nVieussens, du Verney and Dionis.\r\n\r\nRaymond Vieussens (1641–1716), a native of Rovergue, was Professor of\r\nAnatomy at the University of Montpellier, in Southern France. Some idea\r\nof the extraordinary industry displayed by this anatomist may be gained\r\nfrom the fact that he is credited with having dissected more than five\r\nhundred bodies. His more important published works relate to the heart,\r\nthe nervous system and the structures of the organ of hearing. Pagel\r\nspeaks of him as being entitled to the name of founder of the pathology\r\nof diseases of the heart.\r\n\r\nJean Guichard du Verney (1648–1730), who held the Chair of Anatomy\r\nin the University of Paris, gained a large part of his fame as\r\nan anatomist from the excellence of his investigations into the\r\ncomplicated structures of the internal ear.\r\n\r\nPierre Dionis, who died in 1718, was Demonstrator of Anatomy and\r\nSurgery at the Jardin du Roi in Paris during the latter part of the\r\nseventeenth century and early part of the eighteenth. In 1690 he\r\npublished a treatise on anatomy which remained the standard book on\r\nthis subject for a number of years. In course of time it was translated\r\ninto the Latin, English, German and Chinese languages.\r\n\r\n_Dissecting Made a Part of the Regular Training of a Medical\r\nStudent._--The opportunities for dissecting human bodies varied\r\ngreatly in different parts of Europe during the period of which I am\r\nnow treating. Vieussens, as we have just seen, dissected no fewer than\r\nfive hundred bodies during his long professorship at Montpellier;\r\nand Joseph Lieutaud, Professor of Anatomy at Paris, dissected more\r\nthan twelve hundred bodies during the continuance of his connection\r\nwith that institution. So far as I have been able to learn from my\r\nexamination of the literature, the professors and their immediate\r\nofficial assistants were the only persons who had, up to this time,\r\nderived the principal benefits that flow from work of this nature; the\r\nstudents merely listened to the instructor’s remarks upon the objects\r\nwhich had previously been exposed to view by dissection. But toward\r\nthe end of the period--a little before or shortly after the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century--facilities were provided in some of the\r\nmedical schools, and before long in all of the leading ones, for the\r\nstudents themselves to participate in this highly important part of a\r\nphysician’s education. The value of such training was emphasized by\r\nthe statement made by the English philosopher, John Locke (1632–1704),\r\ntoward the end of his life, viz., that all human understanding is based\r\nupon experience. He wrote that at birth the human soul is like a clean\r\nsheet of paper upon which all the objects perceived by the senses are\r\nrecorded as experiences, and there they remain until by the aid of\r\nreflexion--_i.e._, by the aid of the understanding, which Locke\r\ncalls the inner sense--they are combined into conceptions or ideas.\r\nLocke, it should be remembered, was educated as a physician, but he\r\nnever took his degree, nor did he ever practice medicine.\r\n\r\nThe first stimulating effects of the Renaissance upon the devotees\r\nof the science of medicine were felt in Italy toward the end of the\r\nfifteenth century, and these effects rapidly gained in intensity\r\nduring the following century. First France and afterward Switzerland,\r\nBelgium, Holland and England were almost simultaneously brought under\r\nthe same influence; and in all these countries the students manifested\r\na remarkable eagerness to acquire all the knowledge they possibly\r\ncould. In Germany, however, the influence of the Renaissance did not\r\nmake itself felt until a much later date, and the thirst for knowledge\r\nwas very much slower in developing than was the case in any of the\r\nother countries mentioned. Thus Puschmann, in his “History of Medical\r\nEducation,” makes the following statement which shows clearly that in\r\nGermany the university students of that period must have been a very\r\nrough set of men: “In 1625 the Senate of the University of Leipzig was\r\nobliged to warn its students that they must cease disturbing wedding\r\nfestivals and handling the guests roughly, that they must no longer\r\nmake obscene remarks to married women and maidens, etc. And in 1631 a\r\nphysician named Lotichius, in writing to a friend, made the statement\r\nthat ‘in our German high schools the students seem to prefer strife to\r\nthe reading of books, daggers to copy-books, swords to pens, bloody\r\nencounters to learned discussions, incessant boozing and noisy reveling\r\nto the quiet pursuit of their studies, and public-houses and brothels\r\nto students’ work-rooms and libraries.’” In 1660 the students at Jena,\r\non one occasion, carried on a regular battle with the police, and as\r\na result of this encounter several persons were killed. In the light\r\nof this evidence, therefore, it is not surprising that the science of\r\nmedicine made comparatively little advance in Germany until after the\r\neighteenth century was reached.\r\n\r\n_Iatrochemists and Iatrophysicists._--During the seventeenth\r\ncentury there was a great deal of disputing among physiologists about\r\nthe nature of certain processes like assimilation and retrograde\r\nmetamorphosis, about the manner in which blood is formed, about\r\ndigestion, and about the rôle played by the lymph vessels. According to\r\nHaeser a large proportion of the physicians of that day were confident\r\nthat chemistry was entirely competent to solve these riddles, and\r\nyet, on the other hand, there were not a few who believed that the\r\nscience of physics, which was then much further advanced than that\r\nof chemistry, was quite as competent to explain all the phenomena.\r\nAt first the split into these two factions was confined to men who\r\nwere interested in questions of a purely physiological nature, but in\r\na short time the practitioners of medicine were also drawn into the\r\ncontroversy; and from that time onward it became customary to employ\r\nthe terms, “iatrochemists” and “iatrophysicists” in speaking of the\r\npartisans of the two schools of medicine (the iatrochemical and\r\nthe iatrophysical or iatromechanical). The iatrochemists described\r\ndigestion as an act that is essentially chemical in character, a form\r\nof fermentation; and by the latter term the more advanced members of\r\nthis school--François Deleboë Sylvius (1614–1672), who was born in\r\nHanau, Prussia, of Dutch parents, and who took his doctor’s degree in\r\nBasel in 1637, and Thomas Willis of London (1622–1675)--understood\r\nsomething quite different from our modern conception of fermentation.\r\nTheir interpretation was as follows: “An internal chemical movement\r\nof matter which is set agoing and continued in action in the stomach\r\nand intestinal canal through the agency of certain chemical reagents.”\r\n(Haeser.) They attributed an important influence to the saliva, the\r\npancreatic juice and the bile in effecting the changes mentioned. The\r\niatrophysicists, on the other hand, and more particularly Archibald\r\nPitcairn of Edinburgh, Scotland (1652–1713), and Giorgio Baglivi of\r\nRagusa, Italy (1668–1707), described digestion as a purely mechanical\r\nbreaking up of the elements of the food partaken--a “trituration.” As\r\nto the further fate of the resulting chyle (its mode of reaching the\r\nblood, for example) the two schools were in perfect accord.\r\n\r\nSprengel mentions it as an actual fact that, during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, there were several physicians who combined the two careers\r\nof teacher of medicine and hydraulic engineer (iatrophysicists or\r\niatromathematicians).[76] Several events conduced to the formation,\r\nin Italy and in Great Britain, of a distinct iatromathematical\r\nschool. Among them may be mentioned, first and foremost, Harvey’s\r\ndiscovery of the circulation of the blood; second, the spread of the\r\ndoctrines taught by Descartes favored in a marked degree the union\r\nof medicine and mathematics (physiology, the iatromathematicians\r\nclaimed, was only a branch of applied mathematics); and, third, the\r\nformation at Florence, in the middle of the seventeenth century,\r\nof an association of the pupils of Galileo. The objects of this\r\nassociation were to cultivate their master’s philosophy, to carry on\r\nthe work of experimental physics, and to apply its principles in every\r\ndepartment of natural science. Alphonso Borelli (1608–1679), Professor\r\nof Mathematics first at Messina and afterward at Pisa, the author of\r\nthe famous treatise on “The Movements of Animals,” and the founder\r\nof the iatromathematical school, was a member of the association. In\r\nthis connection it is important to mention another zealous worker\r\nin the field of iatromathematics, viz., Sanctorius Sanctorinus, of\r\nCapo d’Istria (1561–1636). His work was done quite independently of\r\nany general movement among scientific investigators and at a much\r\nearlier period than that during which the school flourished. He was\r\nquite successful, for example, in his attempts to measure the actual\r\namount of imperceptible evaporation, and to determine the influence\r\nwhich this process exerts upon health and disease. In the course of\r\nthese investigations in what he called “static medicine,” Sanctorinus\r\ninvented a number of unusual instruments.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of the formation of schools or sects, the members of\r\nwhich were keenly interested in the maintenance and promulgation\r\nof certain physiological, pathological, or therapeutic doctrines,\r\nmanifested itself anew, as I have shown above, in the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In the early years of the Christian era the partisans of\r\ndifferent medical doctrines formed schools of this nature which\r\nflourished for a certain period of time and then died out completely.\r\nSuch, for example, were the sects of the Dogmatists, the Methodists,\r\nthe Pneumatists, etc. The mere fact of the existence of these different\r\nschools or sects showed unmistakably that the science of medicine\r\nwas alive at that time and that its devotees were making vigorous\r\nefforts to increase their stock of knowledge. Then followed the long\r\nperiod of the Middle Ages, a series of many centuries, during which\r\nmedicine made only slight gains; but at last came the Renaissance,--the\r\nfifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,--and here again we have\r\na recurrence of the same phenomenon of sects in medicine; but note the\r\ngreat difference between the earlier manifestations and those which\r\nI have just outlined. The present group, it is proper to remark, is\r\nmerely the forerunner of several similar movements that are to occur\r\nduring the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, movements that are all\r\nbased, in varying degrees, upon the truth.\r\n\r\n_The Employment of Latin in Lecturing and Writing on Medical\r\nTopics._--In all the countries of Europe, but more particularly\r\nin Germany, there existed during the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies--and for a long time subsequently--the practice of delivering\r\nall the lectures on medical topics in the Latin tongue--_i.e._,\r\nin a language which at best could not be easily understood by more\r\nthan a small proportion of the students. Even the lecturers themselves\r\nmust have been hampered in the full expression of their thoughts by\r\nthis rule, which was practically compulsory. Paracelsus (1493–1534),\r\nthe famous Swiss physician, tried--a full century earlier, as will be\r\nshown farther on--to break up this seemingly harmless but in reality\r\nobjectionable custom; his example, however, was not followed, and the\r\npractice was continued without interruption for at least two centuries\r\nlonger. The use of Latin as the language in which all medical knowledge\r\nwas to be taught was undoubtedly based upon the idea that it was\r\nnecessary for the educated physician to be reasonably familiar with\r\nthat particular tongue, for the simple reason that it was the only\r\none in which, in those early days in Western Europe, the writings of\r\nGalen were accessible, for nobody but a few expert scholars had yet\r\nacquired any useful knowledge of Greek, the language in which all of\r\nGalen’s works were originally written. But it is quite likely that\r\nwith this motive, which certainly was intended to produce good and\r\nuseful fruit, there was coupled the further idea that the great mass\r\nof irregular practitioners--the quacks, the early barber-surgeons\r\n(_Wundaerzte_), and the peripatetic physicians--would in this\r\nway be debarred from entering the ranks of the regularly trained\r\nphysicians. It was only after the custom of using the Latin for\r\nlecturing and writing purposes had become thoroughly rooted in the\r\nminds of medical men as something right and proper, that it began to\r\ndawn upon the minds of some of the brighter men that this practice was\r\nharmful to the advance of medicine beyond the standards established\r\nby Galen. Vesalius, who was a contemporary of Paracelsus, fully\r\nappreciated how serious an obstacle to further progress in anatomical\r\nknowledge the teachings of Galen were, and it was he who made the first\r\nreally successful attack on this great hindrance to further progress;\r\nbut there is no evidence to show that he had the slightest idea that\r\nlecturing and writing about medical topics in Latin played any part in\r\nthe perpetuation of the evil which he was fighting. To Paracelsus alone\r\nbelongs the credit, so far as I know, of endeavoring, through the force\r\nof example and by spoken arguments, to break up the practice which we\r\nare here considering. I may be mistaken in the view which I have here\r\nexpressed, but it is difficult for me not to believe that the habitual\r\nuse of Latin as the proper vehicle for the transmission of facts and\r\nideas belonging to the domain of medicine must have materially hindered\r\nthe advancement of that science; for such use certainly tended to keep\r\nmen’s minds moving in fixed ruts, and those ruts all led straight\r\ntoward the faulty teachings of Galen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n    THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY DIFFERENT MEN DURING THE RENAISSANCE,\r\n      AND MORE PARTICULARLY BY WILLIAM HARVEY OF ENGLAND, TO OUR\r\n      KNOWLEDGE OF THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD, LYMPH AND CHYLE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the earliest known doctrines relating to the nature of the blood\r\nand its mode of distribution throughout the body are those attributed\r\nto Erasistratus and Galen; for the still more ancient ones, of which\r\nDiogenes of Apollonia, Aristotle and the Hippocratic writers are\r\nreputed to be the authors, are too incomplete to call for serious\r\nconsideration in this place.\r\n\r\n_(a) The Doctrine Taught by Erasistratus._--Erasistratus, who\r\nwas born at Julis in the Island of Ceos (Aegean Sea) during the third\r\ncentury before Christ, held the belief that the arteries contain\r\nonly air, which is drawn into the lungs by way of the trachea and\r\nbronchi, whence it enters the pulmonary vein (called by him the “venous\r\nartery”). In its further course this air passes from the pulmonary\r\nvein into the left ventricle of the heart, and is then conveyed from\r\nthat organ through the arteries to the different tissues of the body.\r\nErasistratus further taught that the smallest subdivisions of both the\r\narteries and the veins lie side by side in the tissues, and that, in\r\ncertain abnormal bodily conditions, they communicate the one with the\r\nother through anastomoses; but that, in a normal condition of the body,\r\nno communication takes place between the two. In common with all other\r\nphysicians of that time, he believed that only the veins carry blood.\r\nHere, then, we find the first glimmering of the truth with regard\r\nto the nature of the circulating medium and also with regard to the\r\ncourse which it pursues in one part of its circuit--that part, namely,\r\nwhere the two kinds of vessels become capillary in character. His\r\nsubstitution of air for blood in the arteries is plainly the principal\r\nerror in his scheme.\r\n\r\n_(b) The Teaching of Galen and of Caesalpinus with Regard to the\r\nNature of the Blood and Its Mode of Distribution._--Galen, in the\r\nsecond century of the present era, disputed the correctness of the\r\ndoctrine taught by Erasistratus. His objections are thus stated:\r\n“Inasmuch as blood flows from an artery when it is wounded, one of two\r\nthings must be the truth. Either blood was already contained in the\r\nvessel before it was wounded, or it must have found its way in from the\r\noutside. But, if the blood comes from the outside into a vessel which\r\ncontains only air, then air must necessarily escape from that vessel\r\n(when wounded) before blood does--which is contrary to the fact, as\r\nblood alone flows out. Therefore arteries contain only blood.” As a\r\nfurther proof of the correctness of his statement Galen carried out the\r\nfollowing experiment: In a living animal he placed two ligatures around\r\nan artery at points situated not far apart, and then made an opening\r\nin the vessel between the two ligatures. The intervening section of\r\nthe artery, it was thus found, contained only blood. This experiment,\r\nit might reasonably be supposed, would have definitely settled the\r\nquestion; but such was not the case. The followers of Erasistratus\r\nimmediately raised this objection: If the arteries contain blood, how\r\nmay the air which is drawn into the lungs find its way to all parts\r\nof the body? Galen replied that the inhaled air does not pass through\r\nthe lungs, but is rejected by them after it has cooled the blood. This\r\nrefrigerating process, he claimed, constitutes the sole purpose of the\r\nrespiratory act.\r\n\r\nAlthough Galen’s idea regarding the true function of respiration is\r\nnot in harmony with the doctrine taught by modern physiologists, it\r\nnevertheless represents a marked advance over the belief previously\r\nmaintained. Even as recently as in the time of Albert von Haller\r\n(approximately 1760–1780) physicians still continued to believe that\r\nit was the function of respiration to cool the blood; and indeed it\r\nwas scarcely possible before 1800 to offer a more correct physiology\r\nof the act of breathing, for it was not until after the lapse of many\r\ncenturies that the advance in our knowledge of chemistry reached a\r\npoint at which it became possible to find a satisfactory solution of so\r\ncomplicated a problem.\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the blood itself Galen believed, as I have already\r\nstated more fully in Part I. (“Ancient Medicine”), that there are two\r\nkinds--spirituous blood (or spirit) and venous blood. He gave the name\r\nof spirituous blood to that which is found circulating in the arteries,\r\nand which is appreciably brighter in color than that which fills the\r\nveins. According to Flourens, the distinguished French physiologist\r\nof the nineteenth century, Galen was the first among the ancient\r\nanatomists to make this distinction of two different kinds of blood. To\r\nthe spirituous variety Galen ascribed the function of nourishing the\r\nmore delicately constructed organs like the lungs, while he claimed\r\nthat the venous blood is suited to nourish only the coarser ones, like\r\nthe liver, spleen, etc.\r\n\r\nIn his further development of a physiology of the circulation of the\r\nblood Galen, who as a rule expresses his ideas with great clearness,\r\nmakes statements which I find it extremely difficult to comprehend.\r\nI am therefore tempted to assume that the copyists, to whom we are\r\nindebted for handing down his actual words from age to age, are the\r\npersons upon whom should be cast the blame for the obscurity of which\r\nI complain. However this may be, it is an unquestionable fact that\r\nthe ablest physiologists, were they to be confronted to-day with the\r\nduty of solving this problem of the circulation under the conditions\r\nof knowledge which existed during the third century of our era, would\r\nsurely not be able to provide a more correct solution than that which\r\nis credited to Galen. The problem was attacked repeatedly by some\r\nof the brightest and best-equipped minds of the Renaissance period,\r\nbut not one of these exceptionally clever men was able to offer an\r\nentirely acceptable solution. Harvey alone, as will appear farther on\r\nin this account, solved the riddle once and for all.\r\n\r\nThe “spirit”--the purest part of the blood--is lodged, according to\r\nGalen, in the left ventricle; and, inasmuch as even the venous blood,\r\nif it is to fulfil in some degree the function of a nourishing fluid,\r\nmust possess a certain proportion of “spirit,” it is clear that the\r\ntwo ventricles should communicate the one with the other; for how\r\notherwise--thought Galen--is it possible for a certain amount of\r\n“spirit” to commingle with the venous blood? The locality at which\r\nthis communication was assumed to exist was the interventricular\r\nseptum; and, as nobody was able to find anything like a foramen in this\r\nmembrane, it was asserted that the communication is effected through\r\nan infinite number of pores. For over one thousand years physicians\r\naccepted this porous character of the interventricular septum as an\r\nestablished fact. In his commentaries on Mondino’s “Anatomy” (1521),\r\nBerengarius of Carpi timidly ventured the statement that the openings\r\nof communication are not distinctly visible, and this apparently was\r\nthe first feeble expression of doubt concerning the correctness of the\r\nprevailing doctrine. Vesalius, on the other hand, boldly denied their\r\nexistence altogether.\r\n\r\nAccording to Galen’s teaching the liver is the source of origin of all\r\nthe veins, just as the heart is the starting-point of all the arteries.\r\nIt is quite remarkable, says Flourens, that physicians who performed\r\nalmost daily the operation of venesection should, during a long series\r\nof years, have failed to observe that this doctrine of blood flowing\r\nthrough the veins from the liver to the different parts of the body,\r\ncould not possibly be true, inasmuch as at each such operation the\r\nvein always became distended with blood _below_ (_i.e._, on\r\nthe distal side of) the ligature which they applied to the part (arm,\r\nfor example) before opening the vessel. This phenomenon, of course,\r\nindicated clearly that the blood in the veins flowed _toward the\r\nheart_, and not from any centrally located spot or organ _toward\r\nthe extremities_. And yet--he adds--even so bright and thoughtful\r\na man as Vesalius does not appear to have noticed this fact. Andreas\r\nCaesalpinus (1519–1603), on the other hand, did observe and correctly\r\ninterpret the phenomenon; and he made the further observation that\r\nphysicians were habitually applying the ligature _above_ the\r\nspot which they expected to bleed, regardless of the fact that in so\r\ndoing they were not acting in harmony with their belief concerning the\r\ncirculation of blood in the veins. Caesalpinus also states, in one part\r\nof his writings, that “the blood, carried to the heart by the veins,\r\nreceives in that organ its last transformation toward perfection,\r\nand is then--in this perfected state--transported by the arteries to\r\nthe remotest parts of the body.” So far as it relates to the general\r\nmovement of the blood this statement is correct, but it errs, as will\r\nbe shown presently, in mentioning the heart as the locality where the\r\nperfecting process takes place. In his final remarks regarding the\r\nanatomical relations which exist in the two chambers of the heart\r\nCaesalpinus makes the following statement:--\r\n\r\n   Each ventricle possesses two vessels--one through which the\r\n   blood reaches that chamber, and a second one which serves to\r\n   carry it out of the ventricle. The vessel through which the\r\n   blood enters the right ventricle is called the _vena cava_,\r\n   and that by which it leaves this same chamber is called the\r\n   pulmonary artery. The vessel through which the blood arrives\r\n   in the left ventricle is called the pulmonary vein, and that\r\n   through which it leaves this left chamber of the heart is known\r\n   as the aorta.\r\n\r\n_The Circulation of the Blood as Elucidated by Michael\r\nServetus._--Michael Servetus, a native of Villanueva, Spain,\r\nwho in 1553 was burned alive at the stake near the city of Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland, because of his heretical teachings, is not infrequently\r\nmentioned as the individual to whom credit is due for having furnished\r\nthe first description of the lesser or pulmonary circulation. There\r\nis no question whatever regarding the justice of according to him\r\nat least a part of this honor, but one should be careful to specify\r\nthat Servetus is entitled only to the credit of having been the first\r\nto teach that the blood, in its journey from the right to the left\r\nside of the heart, must pass entirely through the lungs. So far, his\r\ndoctrine is correct; but he also taught at the same time that the\r\nfluid which enters the aorta from the left ventricle is not blood but\r\nperfected “vital spirit” (Galen), and that it becomes genuine blood\r\nonly after it has tarried for a few brief instants in the ventricular\r\nchamber and has there been subjected to some unknown influence\r\nexerted by the heart itself. This second erroneous part of Servetus’\r\ndescription seems to me to diminish very materially the credit to which\r\nhe is otherwise entitled; and I cannot help feeling that Dezeimeris is\r\nright when he claims that Realdus Columbus, whose more perfect account\r\nof the lesser circulation was written only a little later than that of\r\nServetus, is perhaps better entitled to the honor in question.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that Servetus introduces his disquisition\r\non the circulation of the blood in the very midst of a treatise which\r\nbears the title “Restitution of Christianity,”--in other words, in a\r\ntreatise which would never, under ordinary circumstances, be consulted\r\nby physicians in their search for information regarding an important\r\nproblem in physiology like that of the circulation of the blood. In\r\nthis physiologico-theological treatise Servetus, who--as I omitted to\r\nstate--was a theologian as well as a physiologist, used the following\r\nexpressions:--\r\n\r\n   The soul, says Holy Writ, is in the blood; as a matter of fact,\r\n   the soul is the blood. And since the soul is in the blood, one\r\n   should--if one wishes to learn how the soul is formed--endeavor\r\n   to learn how the blood is formed; and, in order to learn how\r\n   the blood is formed, it is necessary to ascertain how it moves.\r\n   (Flourens.)\r\n\r\nI am unable to state whether it was this particular chapter, or\r\nthe work taken as a whole, which appeared to the ecclesiastical\r\nauthorities--first those of France and afterward those of Geneva--to\r\nwarrant the author’s condemnation as a heretic. And, when we are\r\ndisposed to blame severely those bigots who, in the fifteenth and\r\nsixteenth centuries, manifested such a keen desire to destroy\r\n“heretics,” let us remember, with a proper sense of shame, that\r\nwe still have in our midst, in this twentieth century and in this\r\n“land of freedom,” men of high social standing who are as virulent\r\nheresy-hunters as ever were the enemies of Servetus.\r\n\r\n_Experiments of Realdus Columbus._--Matthaeus Realdus Columbus,\r\nwho was born at Cremona, Northern Italy, in the early part of the\r\nsixteenth century, acted for some time as Vesalius’ prosector, and\r\nmust therefore have had ample opportunities for acquiring a thorough\r\nknowledge of the experimental method of studying questions in\r\nphysiology. He wrote a description of the pulmonary circulation which\r\nwas more lucid and nearer to the truth than any which his predecessors\r\nhad furnished. This description, which will be found in his treatise\r\non anatomy (Venice, 1559), was based largely upon experiments that he\r\ncarried out upon living dogs. As rendered into English from the French\r\nversion supplied by Dezeimeris, it reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   When the heart dilates the blood passes from the vena cava into\r\n   the right ventricle; from the latter chamber it is pushed into\r\n   the arterial vein (the pulmonary artery), along which channel\r\n   it is carried to the lung, there to be properly thinned and\r\n   mixed with air. Ultimately the blood passes on into the venous\r\n   artery (= the pulmonary vein), the function of which vessel is\r\n   to carry this fluid, now charged with air through the action of\r\n   the lung, into the left ventricle of the heart. Then follows\r\n   the contraction (systole) of this organ, as a result of which\r\n   action the tricuspid valves rise up into position and form a dam\r\n   that prevents the return of the blood into the vena cava and\r\n   the pulmonary veins. Simultaneously with this action the valves\r\n   placed at the opening which represents the commencement of the\r\n   aorta (left ventricle), and those placed at the opening which\r\n   corresponds to the beginning of the pulmonary artery (right\r\n   ventricle), yield and thus open the way for the distribution of\r\n   the blood throughout the rest of the body.\r\n\r\nThe reader will, I believe, admit that this description, while perhaps\r\nnot faultless, is distinctly superior to that given by Servetus.\r\n\r\nColumbus’ experimental studies threw considerable light upon other\r\nmatters relating to the physiology of the heart. He demonstrated,\r\nfor example, that the fluid which enters the left ventricle from the\r\nlungs is genuine blood, and he also learned by the same method of\r\ninvestigation the true nature of the systole and diastole of the heart\r\nand the relations of these acts to the pulse and to the changes in the\r\nposition of the heart. The discovery of all these facts constituted\r\na material advance in our knowledge of the physiology of that organ;\r\nbut, from this time onward, for a period of nearly three-quarters of a\r\ncentury, no further advance was made until William Harvey of England\r\nappeared on the scene. The explanation of the failure of such able\r\ninvestigators as Realdus Columbus, Vesalius, Servetus and others to\r\npush their researches still further is to be found largely in the fact\r\nthat they were all still in bondage to the doctrines taught by Galen\r\ncenturies earlier, and probably more particularly to that dogma which\r\nmaintains that blood--if it is to be accepted as genuine or fully\r\nformed blood--must first have been elaborated in the depths of the\r\nliver. The impossibility of harmonizing such a dogma with the facts\r\nwhich by that time were well established, is too plainly evident to\r\nwarrant further discussion in these pages.\r\n\r\n_Discovery of Valves in the Larger Veins by Fabricius ab\r\nAcquapendente._--The discovery of the presence of valves in the\r\ninterior of the larger veins is credited by some to Cannani (1546)\r\nand by others to Fabricius ab Acquapendente (1574), but the best\r\nauthorities appear to favor the claim of Fabricius to this honor.\r\nThere are also a few authorities who maintain that Fra Sarpi, the\r\ncelebrated monk and scientist of Venice, is entitled to be considered\r\nthe discoverer of the valves in veins, but Tiraboschi, the historian of\r\nItalian literature, makes it clear that this claim is unfounded.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was known to Fabricius that these valves are inclined\r\ntoward the heart, he does not appear to have appreciated the fact that\r\nthis arrangement is entirely incompatible with Galen’s doctrine that\r\nthe flow of venous blood is from the liver toward the extremities; nor\r\ndid any other anatomist, so far as I am able to learn, discover this\r\nincompatibility before it was pointed out by Harvey nearly fifty years\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n_William Harvey, Who is Universally Acknowledged to be the Real\r\nDiscoverer of the Circulation of the Blood._--William Harvey was\r\nborn at Folkstone, England, in 1578, received his academic education at\r\nCaius College, Cambridge, and became a doctor of medicine in 1602, at\r\nthe age of twenty-four. Four or five years before this event he went\r\nto Padua, Italy, to study medicine under Fabricius ab Acquapendente,\r\nwho was considered at that period to be the ablest and most inspiring\r\nteacher of anatomy and physiology in Europe. It was from him, it may\r\nsafely be assumed, that Harvey learned the importance of studying\r\nNature herself, rather than books, when one is desirous of learning her\r\nsecrets. Equipped with a thorough knowledge of the methods that may\r\nbest be employed in making studies of this character, Harvey returned\r\nto England at the end of his long stay at Padua. He was soon afterward\r\nmade a member of the College of Physicians of London, and in 1615 was\r\nelected to the Chair of Anatomy and Surgery in that institution. Later\r\nstill, he was appointed one of the physicians of St. Bartholomew’s\r\nHospital. He also held for several years the position of Court\r\nPhysician, first to James the First and then to Charles the First. It\r\nwas during this period of his professional career that he began working\r\nin earnest upon the problem of the circulation of the blood, and he\r\nkept steadily at this work throughout a period of several years. Among\r\nthe manuscripts preserved in the British Museum there is one bearing\r\nthe date of 1616 which shows that Harvey had already at this time\r\nreached conclusions which, in all essential respects, agree with those\r\nwhich appear in his final treatise published in 1628. The title of the\r\nlatter work is, “_Exercitatio anatomica de motu cordis et sanguinis\r\nin animalibus_” (Frankfort, 1628).\r\n\r\nAlthough, as I have shown above, several of the links in the chain\r\nof proofs bearing upon this question of the circulation had already\r\nbeen discovered before Harvey began his researches, he was not\r\nwilling to accept them as proven facts until he had himself tested\r\nthem thoroughly by the experimental method. Furthermore, they were\r\noften disconnected, and this lack of continuity obliged him to supply\r\nmissing links at several points; in other words, nobody had as yet\r\ndemonstrated the important fact that the blood travels regularly in an\r\nunbroken circuit, and it was to this great task that Harvey devoted\r\nhimself at the period which we are now considering. He carried out\r\nall these investigations with the most painstaking care and made\r\npublic announcement of his discoveries only after the lapse of an\r\nextraordinary length of time; his chief object being that ample\r\nopportunity might thereby be afforded for complete verification. The\r\nfollowing are among the more important questions which he investigated\r\nand to which he furnished satisfactory solutions. He learned, for\r\nexample, that the auricle and ventricle of each side of the heart do\r\nnot contract simultaneously but in succession. When the right auricle\r\ncontracts the blood which it then contains passes into the right\r\nventricle; and when the right ventricle contracts the blood is driven\r\ninto the pulmonary artery. From this vessel it passes ultimately into\r\nthe pulmonary vein, and from the latter into the left auricle, which\r\nthen contracts and drives the blood into the left ventricle. The\r\nlatter chamber next contracts and forces the blood into the aorta,\r\nwhence it is carried into all the arteries of the body. From these, in\r\nturn, it passes into the veins and thence back to the right auricle\r\nof the heart--the point from which it started. He corroborated the\r\nfinding--by other anatomists who had preceded him--of membranous valves\r\nat the spots where the blood passes from one chamber to the other;\r\nand he compared these valves to little doors which open to permit the\r\npassage of the blood in one direction, but which close when there is\r\nany tendency for it to pass in the opposite direction. The valves\r\nof the right auricle, for example, allow the blood to pass into the\r\nright ventricle, but prevent it from returning into the auricle. Then,\r\nfurther, the valves of the right ventricle permit the blood to pass\r\ninto the pulmonary artery, but prevent it from returning into the\r\nventricle. The valves of the left auricle permit the blood to pass\r\ninto the left ventricle, but do not permit it to return into the left\r\nauricle. Finally, the valves of the left ventricle allow the blood to\r\npass into the aorta, but prevent it from regurgitating into the same\r\nventricle. The valves with which the veins are equipped permit the\r\nblood to travel onward toward the heart, but do not permit it to back\r\nup into the arteries.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 15. WILLIAM HARVEY.\r\n\r\n  (After the portrait by Cornelius Jonson.)]\r\n\r\nGalen taught that the arteries pulsated by reason of a “pulsific power”\r\nwhich they derive in direct continuity from the tunics of the heart.\r\nHe tried to prove the correctness of his doctrine by experimental\r\nmethods, but in this he failed. Harvey was convinced that the arteries\r\ndo not pulsate by reason of their own inherent power, but by a force\r\nof impulsion communicated to the blood at the heart. He refers to this\r\nquestion in the following terms: “When an artery is opened the blood\r\nescapes in jets of unequal force; the alternate jets being stronger\r\nthan the intermediate, and the stronger jets corresponding in time of\r\noccurrence, not with the systoles but with the diastoles of the artery.\r\nThe artery, therefore, must be distended by impulsion, by the shock of\r\nthe blood. If the artery dilates by reason of its own inherent power,\r\nthe blood would not be expelled with the maximum force at the very\r\nmoment when this dilatation occurs.” As evidence of the non-existence\r\nof Galen’s assumed “pulsific power,” Harvey mentions the fact that, in\r\nthe case of a patch-shaped calcification of the crural artery which\r\ncame under his observation, the pulsation took place as usual, but at a\r\npoint below (distal to) the edge of the patch. The intervening patch of\r\nrigid calcareous matter was not able to prevent the traveling onward of\r\nthe propelling power.\r\n\r\nHarvey next takes up the consideration of the veins, and, after\r\nshowing that they permit a flow of the contained blood in only one\r\ndirection,--viz., that from the extremities toward the heart,--he\r\ncalls attention to certain experiences which he has had: (1) When a\r\ncord is tied lightly around a limb the flow of blood is arrested _only\r\nin the veins_, because these vessels are located near the surface of\r\nthe skin; but, if the cord is tied more tightly, the flow of blood\r\nis also arrested in the arteries, which lie at a relatively great\r\ndepth. (2) When a vein is tied the resulting distension manifests\r\nitself _only below_ (_i.e._, on the distal side of) the ligature;\r\nwhereas, when an artery is similarly tied, the distension takes place\r\n_above_ (_i.e._, on the proximal side of) the ligature. It is therefore\r\nplain that in the veins the blood flows from the individual parts\r\ntoward the heart, but that in the arteries the flow is in the reverse\r\ndirection--_i.e._, from the heart toward the individual parts. “If one\r\nreflects upon the nature of the movement of the blood,” says Flourens,\r\n“one will promptly realize how speedy it is. Scarcely has the blood\r\nentered the heart before it is hurried into the arteries; and then\r\nfrom these vessels it passes in an instant into the veins, from which,\r\nwith almost equal speed, it finally travels back to the heart again.\r\nIt is this never-ending movement from one channel into another, and\r\nthen eventually back to the starting-point, which constitutes the\r\ncirculation of the blood.... Modern physiology dates from the discovery\r\nof the circulation of the blood. Up to the time of this discovery\r\nphysiologists followed the ancients; they did not dare to walk alone.\r\nHarvey had discovered the most beautiful phenomenon in the animal\r\neconomy.... From this time forward, instead of swearing by Galen and by\r\nAristotle, one had to swear by Harvey!”\r\n\r\nDespite the great care which Harvey took to back up his scheme of the\r\ncirculation of the blood with unimpeachable proofs of its correctness,\r\nhe was obliged to pass through the same sort of experience as that to\r\nwhich Vesalius and scores of other pioneers in the field of scientific\r\ninquiry had been subjected. Two hostile forces stood constantly\r\nready, during that fruitful period of the Renaissance, to attack with\r\nmerciless bitterness all those who ventured to add new facts to our\r\nstock of knowledge in the domain of medicine. On the one side were the\r\nmany men of small calibre, men filled with jealousy over the successes\r\ngained by co-workers in the same field; and on the other was marshaled\r\nthe host of those who honestly believed that all medical wisdom ended\r\nwith Galen. Before his death, however (hardly thirty years later),\r\nHarvey had the satisfaction of witnessing the almost unanimous\r\nacceptance of his dogma concerning the circulation of the blood. Louis\r\nthe Fourteenth, King of France at this period, was so appreciative of\r\nthe importance of Harvey’s discoveries that he appointed Dionis, the\r\ndistinguished French anatomist, to demonstrate to the students of the\r\nMedical School of the Jardin des Plantes at Paris the circulation of\r\nthe blood and other recent discoveries. Descartes (1596–1650), the\r\ncelebrated French philosopher, paid an even greater compliment to the\r\nhigh character of the work accomplished by Harvey. His words, as quoted\r\nby Flourens, are as follows:--\r\n\r\n   If I am asked why the supply of venous blood does not become\r\n   exhausted in flowing thus unceasingly into the heart, and why\r\n   the arteries--since all the blood that passes through the\r\n   heart must travel along these vessels--do not become filled to\r\n   overflowing, I can see no good reason why I should not give\r\n   to this question the very same answer that William Harvey, an\r\n   English physician, to whom praise is due for having taught ...,\r\n   has already given. [Then follows the text of Harvey’s reply.]\r\n\r\nOur readers have doubtless noted the fact that, while Harvey, as I have\r\nendeavored to show in the preceding account, has clearly established\r\nhis right to be considered the discoverer of the circulation of the\r\nblood in all its most essential features, his scheme fails to furnish\r\nany information concerning the composition of the blood and the manner\r\nin which it is built up into a life-giving fluid. In the minds of some\r\nthis may seem to be an omission. A moment’s reflection, however, will\r\nsatisfy any reasonable person that questions of this nature do not form\r\na legitimate part of the problem which Harvey was engaged in solving,\r\nand that they therefore should receive separate consideration. Thus,\r\nfor example, Harvey’s scheme fails to furnish satisfactory information\r\nconcerning those portions of the circuit where the blood is obliged\r\nto travel through a system of communicating capillary channels, as\r\nhappens in the lungs and in the tissues generally throughout the body.\r\nBut Harvey had no means at his command for investigating a question\r\nof this nature. Capillary blood-vessels are invisible to the naked\r\neye, and may be studied only with the aid of a microscope; but this\r\ninstrument was not available until long after the time (1605–1616)\r\nwhen Harvey was engaged in carrying out his investigations into the\r\ncirculation of the blood.\r\n\r\n_Other Discoveries Relating to the Vascular System._--To Vesalius\r\nis due the credit of having discovered the fact that anastomoses exist\r\nbetween the carotids and the vertebral arteries, thus explaining how a\r\nman may continue to live even after both carotids have been severed or\r\nligated. His great rival, Fallopius, described these anastomoses in the\r\nmost detailed manner, and he noted the further fact that an anastomosis\r\nwith the basilar artery exists.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the sixteenth century a certain amount of progress had\r\nbeen made toward a correct knowledge of the lymphatics. Bartholomaeus\r\nEustachius, for example, discovered the existence (in horses) of the\r\nthoracic duct, but he supposed it to be a vein. His description of this\r\nvessel reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   In these animals there is a large vessel which extends downward\r\n   from the inner aspect of the clavicular vein (= left subclavian\r\n   vein). At the point where it joins the vein it is closed by\r\n   means of a semicircular valve. This vessel is of a whitish\r\n   color and it contains a scanty watery fluid. Not far from its\r\n   starting-point it divides into two branches which very soon,\r\n   however, join together again, and then, as a single trunk from\r\n   which no further branches are given off, it passes down along\r\n   the left side of the spinal column, penetrates the diaphragm,\r\n   spreads itself out over the aorta, and ends in a manner unknown\r\n   to me.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred years later (1647), Jean Pecquet of Dieppe, France,\r\nprofessor in the Medical School of Montpellier, rediscovered (in a\r\ndog) this same duct, with its tributary chyle ducts and also its point\r\nof entrance into the left subclavian vein; and, as he had rightly\r\ninterpreted its nature, anatomists by common agreement accorded him the\r\nrights of discoverer.\r\n\r\nAt a still earlier date (1622) Caspar Aselli of Cremona, Northern\r\nItaly, professor in the Medical School of Pavia, discovered the chyle\r\nducts. This discovery was made under the following circumstances, which\r\nreveal the fact that good luck sometimes plays an important part in\r\nthe work of the searcher after truth in the departments of anatomy and\r\nphysiology:--\r\n\r\n   Aselli was studying the distribution of the recurrent nerves and\r\n   the movements of the diaphragm in a well-nourished living dog,\r\n   when his attention was drawn to the presence of a large number\r\n   of delicate white threads coursing as it were over the surface\r\n   of the mesentery. Following the accidental injuring of one of\r\n   these threads there escaped from the wounded structure quite\r\n   a large quantity of chyle. Aselli, who instantly appreciated\r\n   the full significance of what had happened, exclaimed, in the\r\n   presence of the bystanders, “Eureka!” At the time he supposed\r\n   that these chyle vessels terminated in the liver and contributed\r\n   in some manner to the elaboration of the blood (in harmony with\r\n   Galen’s universally accepted theory of sanguification); but\r\n   later, after he had carried out a carefully conducted series\r\n   of experiments, he was able to rectify this erroneous belief.\r\n   (Haeser.)\r\n\r\nGalen’s theory of sanguification may be stated as follows: The chyle is\r\nreceived into the veins of the intestinal wall and carried thence to\r\nthe liver, in which organ they are all gathered together into a single\r\nvenous trunk which has received the name of “_vena portae_”--the\r\nvein of the gateway. Everything that is destined to enter the liver\r\npasses through this portal vein. In the organ itself the chyle\r\nundergoes certain modifications, the result of which is, first, to\r\ndeprive it of its impurities and then, in addition, to effect other\r\nchanges that convert it into blood. Aselli’s glory, then, consists in\r\nhis having shown that chyle is taken up from the intestinal mucous\r\nmembrane by a set of its own vessels, and not by the veins, as taught\r\nby Galen.\r\n\r\nIn 1651 Olaus Rudbeck of Arosen, Sweden, discovered the lymphatics of\r\nthe intestinal canal and followed their distribution into the lymph\r\nnodes; he also established their relations with the thoracic duct and\r\nwith the venous system.\r\n\r\nThus, thanks to the series of brilliant discoveries made by William\r\nHarvey, Realdus Columbus, Fabricius ab Acquapendente, Pecquet, Aselli\r\nand a few others, the doctrine of the circulation of the blood and of\r\nthe part played by the accessory chyle and lymphatic vascular systems,\r\nbecame firmly established before the end of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n       ADVANCES MADE IN INTERNAL MEDICINE AND IN THE COLLATERAL\r\n     BRANCHES OF BOTANY, PHARMACOLOGY, CHEMISTRY AND PATHOLOGICAL\r\n                                ANATOMY\r\n\r\n\r\n_General Remarks._--In the fundamental branches of medical\r\nknowledge--anatomy and physiology--advances of a very decided character\r\nwere accomplished during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; and\r\nin the preceding chapters I have endeavored to give my readers some\r\nidea of the nature of these advances, of the men who were instrumental\r\nin effecting them, and of the extent to which the way was made easy,\r\nduring this period, for the accomplishment of still further advances.\r\nIn carrying on the work of correcting the many errors which were found\r\nto exist in the two departments mentioned, it was soon discovered that\r\nthe obstacles to be overcome were of a serious character, and that\r\nthe most formidable one of the group was what is universally known as\r\nGalenism. If I now refer to this subject once more, perhaps for the\r\nsecond or third time in the course of this history, it is because I\r\nfear that my remarks with regard to the harmful influence exerted by\r\nGalenism may not be rightly interpreted. For Galen’s personal character\r\nI entertain, as I have already stated in the section relating to\r\nAncient and Mediaeval Medicine, the deepest respect, and I am filled\r\nwith great admiration for what he accomplished in advancing the science\r\nof medicine; but at the same time I cannot overlook the fact that he\r\nwas hemmed in by insurmountable limitations. No single human being,\r\nliving at the beginning of the present era and surrounded, as Galen\r\nwas, by a herd of jealous rivals, could have successfully bid defiance\r\nto those who considered it sacrilegious to dissect the dead body of a\r\nfellow man; and yet, without the knowledge which may only in this way\r\nbe gained, how was it practicable for any individual, no matter how\r\nclever he might be, to lay the foundations for a further advance in\r\nmedical knowledge? It seems to me therefore plain that Galen did all\r\nthat lay in his power to advance the science of medicine; and whatever\r\nwords of condemnation I may have employed in the text, when speaking\r\nof the Galenists, refer solely to those physicians of later centuries\r\nwho were of such a narrow-minded type, so rigidly crystallized in the\r\nbelief that Galen’s teachings had reached the limit of all possible\r\nknowledge in the science of medicine, that they did not hesitate to\r\nclass the efforts of men like Vesalius as acts of unpardonable impiety.\r\nGalenism, then, refers to the very widely prevalent tendency among\r\nphysicians of the fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries to\r\nuphold the teachings of Galen as the _only_ trustworthy code upon\r\nwhich they should depend for their guidance. In short, Galenism, at the\r\nperiod named, meant for medicine a complete arrest of development.\r\n\r\nI have now arrived at a point in the history of medicine where, owing\r\nto the limited amount of space at my command, the difficulty of\r\ndeciding as to what subjects and what individual workers in the field\r\nof medicine--a field now grown to very great proportions--shall receive\r\nconsideration in my sketch. Having decided from the very outset that my\r\nbest efforts shall be directed, consistently with a strict adherence\r\nto historical truth, toward making my account readable, I now find it\r\nabsolutely necessary to jettison--if I may be permitted to use such a\r\nnautical expression--much really valuable cargo, and to put ashore,\r\nbefore continuing our voyage, many passengers of undoubted worth.\r\nNobody need bemoan the loss of all these valuable treasures, for the\r\ngreat majority of them, I am confident, will be cared for properly by\r\nthose authors who are privileged to treat this whole subject with some\r\ndegree of thoroughness; and the reader, if he is familiar with German,\r\nwill even now find, in the excellent general treatises of Haeser, von\r\nGurlt, Pagel, Puschmann, Baas-Henderson and Neuburger, great stores\r\nof the most satisfactory information concerning the thousand and one\r\ndetails about which I am obliged to remain silent.\r\n\r\n_Internal Pathology._--During the fifteenth century the\r\npractitioners of medicine in Italy and France were still strongly\r\nunder the influence of the teachings of the Arabian medical authors.\r\nOne of the first writers in Italy to place the doctrines of internal\r\nmedicine upon a firmer footing was Antonius Benevienus, a native of\r\nFlorence (1440–1502). His treatise on some of the unusual causes of\r\ndisease, which was printed in Florence in 1506, is said to be written\r\nin very clear language and to be based entirely upon cases which came\r\nunder his own observation. According to Haeser the first improvements\r\nin the doctrines relating to pathological anatomy may be credited to\r\nBenevienus, who also taught that pathological phenomena should be\r\nstudied by direct observation rather than from books.\r\n\r\nJohannes Manardus of Ferrara (1462–1536) was a very sturdy opponent\r\nof astrology, and, in general, did all in his power to weaken the\r\nprevailing blind trust in the authority of the Arabian medical authors.\r\nBut the two physicians who, next to Fabricius ab Acquapendente, stand\r\nout most conspicuously among their Italian contemporaries of the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries, are Fracastoro and Lancisi--the\r\nformer a native of Northern and the latter of Southern Italy.\r\n\r\nHieronymus Fracastoro of Verona (1483–1553) ranks very high among the\r\nphysicians of the first half of the sixteenth century for his valuable\r\ncontributions to our knowledge of internal pathology. In the treatise\r\nwhich he published in 1546 on contagious maladies, he states in plain\r\nlanguage his belief that the causes of diseases of this nature are to\r\nbe found in living germs that are endowed with the power of propagating\r\nthemselves. He divides these diseases into the following three groups:--\r\n\r\n   1, Those which infect only by contact; 2, Those which not\r\n   only infect by contact, but at the same time leave behind a\r\n   centre or focus of infection--in which category he places\r\n   tuberculosis, elephantiasis, and similar diseases; and 3, Those\r\n   which infect not only by direct contact, or through the agency\r\n   of a residuary centre or focus of infection, but also those\r\n   which are capable of spreading their infective elements over\r\n   wide areas--for instance, the pestilential fevers, certain\r\n   ophthalmias, variola, etc. (From Viktor Fossel’s version of\r\n   Fracastoro’s treatise published in Leipzig in 1910.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of tuberculosis (called by him “phthisis”), Fracastoro says\r\nthat it is astonishing for how great a length of time the virus of this\r\ndisease retains its infective power. “It has been noted, for example,\r\nthat in quite a number of instances the clothes worn by a tuberculous\r\npatient have communicated the disease to a healthy individual as late\r\nas two years subsequently to the date at which they were removed from\r\nthe original tuberculous individual.” The same power of communicating\r\ninfection, he continues, may reside in such other objects as the bed,\r\nthe walls and the floor of the room in which a tuberculosis patient has\r\ndied. Under these circumstances, he adds, we are obliged to assume that\r\ngerms of this infective disease have remained attached to the different\r\nobjects mentioned.\r\n\r\nFracastoro was born in Verona, Italy, of parents who belonged to the\r\npatrician class and were in easy circumstances. He studied mathematics\r\nand philosophy at the University of Padua, and was quite prepared,\r\non reaching the age of twenty, to pass the examinations required of\r\ncandidates for the degree of Doctor of Medicine. Just at this time,\r\nhowever, Padua was not a safe place of residence, owing to the war\r\nthat was threatened between the Emperor Maximilian the First and the\r\nRepublic of Venice. Accordingly Fracastoro took his degree at the\r\nnewly established Academy of Pordenone, in what is known to-day as the\r\nProvince of Udine (northeast of Venice); and shortly afterward, upon\r\nthe death of his father, he returned to Verona and began the practice\r\nof medicine. As he quickly gained the confidence of the people, he\r\nvery soon found himself in a sufficiently prosperous condition to\r\nwarrant him in retaining possession of the family residence, which\r\nwas charmingly located at the foot of Monte Incaffi, midway between\r\nthe Adige River and the Lake of Garda. Here it was that Fracastoro\r\ndid a large part of his literary work, for he was a poet as well as\r\na physician. Pope Paul the Third appointed him to the position of\r\nPhysician-in-Ordinary to the Council of Trent, and it was by his advice\r\nthat, upon the appearance of the Plague in that city, the sittings\r\nof the Council were thereafter held for a short season at Bologna.\r\nLater, still other honors fell to his lot. He enjoyed the esteem of the\r\nEmperor Charles the Fifth and of Francis the First, King of France; and\r\nthe latter’s highly cultivated sister, Margaret of Navarre, offered him\r\nevery inducement to settle at her Court, but the attractions of his own\r\nhome made it easy for him to decline all these offers. He died at his\r\nvilla on August 6, 1553, and six years later the city of Verona erected\r\nin his honor a marble memorial tablet.\r\n\r\nFossel, in his biographical sketch of Fracastoro, says that the most\r\npopular of his poetical writings was that entitled, “_Syphilis sive\r\nmorbus Gallicus_.” It was published in several successive editions,\r\nand was translated into nearly all the languages of European countries.\r\nI shall have occasion to refer to it again in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nGiovanni Maria Lancisi was born at Rome on October 26, 1654. Like\r\nBoerhaave he began his university studies under the service of the\r\nChurch, but, as time went on, his leaning toward the profession of\r\nmedicine became more and more pronounced, and he soon took up in\r\nearnest the study of that science at the University of Sapienza,\r\ndevoting a large share of his time to dissecting and to clinical work\r\nin the hospitals. In 1672, when he was only eighteen years old, he was\r\ngiven the degree of Doctor of Medicine; and four years later, after a\r\ncompetitive examination, he was appointed an assistant at the Hospital\r\nof the Holy Ghost. In 1678 he was permitted, as a special honor, to\r\nenrol himself as a student in the Collège de Saint-Sauveur. During\r\nthe following five years he enjoyed at this institution exceptional\r\nfacilities for studying medical literature, and was thus able to\r\naccumulate an immense mass of useful extracts from the writings of the\r\nbest authors. In 1684 he was assigned to the duty of teaching anatomy\r\nat the Sapienza, and for thirteen years he filled this post with great\r\ncredit to himself; Malpighi being one of those who took pleasure in\r\nfollowing his lectures. He had scarcely attained his thirtieth year\r\nwhen he was honored by being appointed Physician-in-Chief and Privy\r\nCouncilor to Pope Innocent the Eleventh; and soon afterward he was made\r\na Canon of the Church of Saint Lawrence, the main purpose of which\r\nappointment was to provide him with a suitable income. On the death\r\nof the Pope in 1689 he resigned the latter office, in order that he\r\nmight have more leisure and freedom to pursue his professional duties.\r\nSubsequently he became the regular medical attendant, first of Pope\r\nInnocent the Twelfth and afterward of Pope Clement the Eleventh. He\r\ndied on January 21, 1720.\r\n\r\nVon Haller speaks of Lancisi as “a physician who was most highly\r\nesteemed by Pope Clement the Eleventh, who was very learned and very\r\nphilanthropic, and who loved to give aid to the afflicted and to\r\nprevent litigation by wise counsels.” It was Lancisi also, as I have\r\nstated on a previous page, who discovered at Rome, in the possession of\r\nthe heirs of the artist Pini who made the original drawings, the copper\r\nplates which Eustachius had ordered nearly two hundred years earlier,\r\nand which were to have been used by this celebrated anatomist in the\r\nproduction of a most beautiful set of anatomical illustrations.[77]\r\n\r\nThe two most important original treatises published by Lancisi bear the\r\nfollowing titles: “_De motu cordis et aneurysmatibus_” (on the\r\nmovements of the heart and on aneurysms), Rome, 1728 (a later edition\r\nin 1745); and “_De subitaneis mortibus Libri II_” (on sudden\r\ndeaths), Rome, 1707 (also later editions).\r\n\r\n_Botany and Botanical Gardens._--The Egyptians, the Persians, the\r\ninhabitants of India and China, and the ancient Greeks accumulated a\r\ngreat mass of information relating to plants which might be utilized\r\nin the treatment of different diseases. Then, in the early part of the\r\npresent era, Galen contributed not a little to our further knowledge\r\non this subject; but from that time forward, until the sixteenth\r\ncentury, pharmacology practically remained unchanged. The beginnings of\r\na systematic study of all plants--in other words, modern botany--may\r\nbe traced to the establishment of botanical gardens, first in Italy\r\nand afterward in Holland and France. According to Berendes the very\r\nearliest attempt in relatively modern times to cultivate such a garden\r\nwas made at Salerno by Matthaeus Silvaticus. Then Master Gualterus, in\r\n1333, was permitted by the Governing Council of Venice to make use of\r\na certain plot of ground for the cultivation of the plants in which he\r\nwas specially interested. So far as one may judge, however, both of\r\nthese were private undertakings. In 1545, at the request of Francesco\r\nBuonafrede, Professor of Therapeutics at the University of Padua, the\r\nSenate of that city laid out a garden for his uses in teaching. This\r\nappears to be the earliest instance of the establishment of a botanical\r\ngarden in connection with a regularly organized medical school. Then,\r\nin fairly quick succession, similar gardens were established at Pisa\r\n(1547), Bologna (1567), Leyden, Holland (by Boerhaave in 1577), and\r\nHeidelberg (1593). In France the University of Montpellier received\r\nits first botanical garden in the year last named. Thus it appears\r\nthat about the middle of the sixteenth century botany began to receive\r\nattention as a branch of knowledge which, as was then believed, it was\r\nimportant for physicians to study; and from that time forward, for\r\nmore than two centuries, it formed a regular part of the curriculum in\r\nall the leading medical schools. The two chairs of botany and anatomy\r\nwere not infrequently combined. Fallopius, for example, held the Chair\r\nof Anatomy, Surgery and Botany in the University of Padua, and so\r\nalso did Vesling in the same university at a somewhat later date. The\r\nfirst systematic works on botany were also published in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. They were all written by German or Swiss authors, the most\r\nnoteworthy one of the collection being that of Conrad Gesner of Zürich\r\n(1516–1565), who is spoken of by Haeser as “a man of noble birth, of\r\nextraordinary industry, of extensive knowledge in every department\r\nof natural history, and the author of a large number of treatises,\r\nwhich, by reason of their intrinsic value, cannot fail to perpetuate\r\nthe memory of this distinguished scientist throughout all time.” He\r\nhad much to contend with throughout his short but eventful life. In\r\nthe first place, he was very poor--so poor that both he and his young\r\nwife were obliged to support themselves during the early years of their\r\nmarried life by teaching school. Then he studied medicine at Basel, and\r\nafterward accepted the professorship of Greek, first at Lausanne and\r\nthen in turn at Basel and at Zürich. From the beginning to the end of\r\nhis career he was hampered by poverty and by frequent illnesses. But,\r\ndespite these obstacles and also notwithstanding the fact that he was\r\nan indefatigable worker in matters relating to natural history, he is\r\nreported to have played one of the most influential parts in the drama\r\nof the Reformation. Only a man of exceptionally strong character and\r\nof unusual ability would have found it possible to attain the success\r\nwhich Gesner attained in these different undertakings and under such\r\nunfavorable circumstances. Andreas Caesalpinus, whom I have already\r\nmentioned as one of the earliest investigators of the question of\r\nthe circulation of the blood, also interested himself in the science\r\nof botany. Puschmann speaks of him as the greatest botanist of the\r\nsixteenth century. For several years he was Professor of Philosophy and\r\nMedicine in the University of Pisa, but at a later date Pope Clement\r\nthe Eighth chose him to be his private physician and also appointed him\r\nProfessor of Medicine in the University of Sapienza at Rome. His death\r\noccurred in the latter city in 1603.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing all further consideration of the part played by\r\nItalian and Spanish physicians during the sixteenth century in the\r\nadvancement of the science of medicine, I shall briefly mention a\r\nfew additional discoveries in botany and pharmacy that may serve to\r\nrender the present account more complete. In 1518 the monk Romano Pane\r\npublished the first account of the discovery of tobacco in America.\r\nIn 1560 Jean Nicot, a French diplomatist, brought back with him from\r\nPortugal (to which country he had been sent as an ambassador) a small\r\nsupply of the seeds of the plant. To commemorate this service the\r\nalkaloid found in the leaves of the tobacco plant was given the name of\r\n_nicotine_. Capsicum was made known to the world by Dr. Chanca, a\r\ncompanion of Christopher Columbus on the occasion of his second voyage\r\n(1493) to America. Balsam of Copaiva was discovered by a Portuguese\r\nmonk in Brazil at some time between the years 1570 and 1600. It is\r\nmentioned for the first time in the Amsterdam Pharmacopoeia of 1636.\r\nMonardes described the Peruvian and Tolu balsams in 1565. Cacao was\r\nfirst made known to Europeans by Fernando Cortez in 1519. About the\r\nyear 1550 coca was introduced as a drug that possesses the power of\r\nallaying hunger and of enabling one to endure the fatigues attending\r\nprolonged expeditions. Sarsaparilla came into use at about the same\r\ndate. Then followed jalap in 1556 and sassafras toward the end of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nIn Germany and in the Netherlands there were, during the sixteenth\r\ncentury, very few physicians who manifested any marked degree of\r\nlearning in the science of medicine. The teachings of Paracelsus met\r\nwith a favorable reception in these parts of Europe and they continued\r\nto hold supreme sway over the minds of men during a long period of\r\ntime. There were some physicians, however, who had received their early\r\nprofessional training in Italy and France, and who for this reason\r\nwere less ready to accept unreservedly the doctrines of Paracelsus;\r\nand, among these more independent spirits, Rembert Dodoens (Dodonaeus,\r\n1517–1586) of Malines, near Antwerp, distinguished himself by making a\r\nnumber of valuable contributions to the science of medicine. He held\r\nthe Chair of Medicine at the University of Leyden and was also the\r\npersonal physician of the Emperors Maximilian the Second and Rudolphus\r\nthe Second. He was a very accurate observer, and his writings are\r\nparticularly rich in matters relating to pathological anatomy; for\r\nwhich reason not a few authorities are inclined to credit him with the\r\nhonor of being the founder of this department of medical science. Felix\r\nPlatter of Basel, Switzerland, of whose experiences as a student at the\r\nUniversity of Montpellier I have given a brief account on a previous\r\npage, and who was at this time Professor of Medicine in his native\r\ncity, was also greatly interested in pathological anatomy. Haeser gives\r\nhim credit for publishing a number of valuable contributions to this\r\ndepartment of medical knowledge, and also for making the first attempt\r\nat a classification of diseases.\r\n\r\nBefore I close this chapter it seems only fair that I should add a\r\nfew comments upon the careers of two physicians whose professional\r\nattainments entitle them to some consideration. The men to whom I have\r\nreference are Marcello Donato and Raymond Minderer.\r\n\r\nMarcello Donato was a distinguished medical practitioner of the city of\r\nMantua, Northeastern Italy, who died about the year 1600. He was one of\r\nthe few who, at that early period, taught that it was very important to\r\nstudy disease from nature--_i.e._, from direct observation--and\r\nnot from books. His description of the epidemic of small-pox of 1567\r\n(published at Mantua in 1569) is worthy of commendation. His chief\r\nwork, however, is that which bears the title “_De medica historia\r\nmirabili etc._” (Mantua, 1586.) It contains a remarkably large and\r\ncomplete collection of rare and extraordinary cases belonging to every\r\ndepartment of medicine, and in his descriptions Donato pays particular\r\nattention to the pathologico-anatomical aspects of each case. He\r\nreports, for example, the instance of a Caesarian section performed on\r\na living woman in 1540 by Christopher Bain; the child being found dead.\r\nAnother interesting case reported by Donato is that of a child in whose\r\near a cherry pit had been allowed to remain undisturbed until it began\r\nto sprout; after which it was found easy to remove the impacted object.\r\nIn a somewhat similar case which Donato also reports, the sprouting\r\nof the seed of Anagyris was hastened by the presence of a purulent\r\ndischarge from the ear. In both instances all attempts to extract the\r\nforeign body had failed until the sprouting had caused the seed to\r\nsplit. Finally, there is recorded the case of a young man into whose\r\nnasal passage a leech had penetrated, while he was bathing, and had\r\nthen taken up its abode far back in the canal. Donato, by aid of direct\r\nsunlight, “discovered the creature in that part where the nasal channel\r\nmerges into the oral cavity.” Presumably he succeeded in removing the\r\nanimal, but the text quoted by von Gurlt (Vol. II., p. 517) furnishes\r\nno further particulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n                CHEMISTRY AND EXPERIMENTAL PHARMACOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiments which were carried out by Antonius Musa Brassavola, in\r\nthe early part of the sixteenth century, upon animals and criminals,\r\nfor the purpose of learning the effects produced by certain drugs when\r\nadministered internally, afford one of the earliest instances of a\r\ngenuine experimental pharmacology. The account of these experiments,\r\nwhich was published at Rome, in 1536, under the title “_Examen omnium\r\nsimplicium, quorum usus est in publicis officinis_,” deserves\r\nhonorable mention. An even more remarkable evidence of the research\r\nspirit which was abroad at that period is to be found in the work done\r\nby Fortunatus Fedelis, a native of Palermo, Sicily, and an ardent\r\nchampion of the direct method of observation as applied to therapeutics.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont, of whose life and contributions to the science of medicine\r\nI now propose to furnish a sketch, represents in a certain sense\r\nParacelsus’ successor; and, as a matter of fact, he was even more\r\nclosely associated with the development of chemistry as an independent\r\nscience than was his predecessor.\r\n\r\nJean Baptiste Van Helmont was born at Brussels in 1577. His parents,\r\nwho belonged to the nobility, possessed ample financial means and\r\nwere therefore able to give their son every opportunity to secure a\r\nliberal education. While still a lad he enrolled himself among the\r\nstudents of the University of Louvain, and advanced so rapidly in his\r\nstudies that, already at the early age of seventeen, he had passed\r\nall the examinations required of applicants for the degree of Master\r\nof Philosophy. He was not willing, however, to receive this honor\r\nat that time, feeling that he had not acquired sufficient knowledge\r\nto justify such acceptance; and from that date forward he turned his\r\nattention to the study of other branches of learning. Finally, in 1599,\r\nhe accepted from the same university the degree of Doctor of Medicine,\r\nand soon afterward left Belgium with a large party of his friends to\r\nmake an extensive tour through the Alps of Switzerland and Savoy. After\r\nhis return home in 1602 he devoted his attention chiefly to chemical\r\nresearches; but in a very short time he started off again on a journey\r\nto Spain and France, and eventually to England, where he spent nearly a\r\nyear in the city of London, returning to Belgium in 1605. He married,\r\nabout this time, a rich heiress of Wilworde, in the neighborhood of\r\nBrussels, and resumed with great zest his labors in chemistry and\r\nalchemy. He was thus enabled to manufacture many remarkable remedies\r\nwith which--as he himself declared--he succeeded in curing myriads\r\nof patients who had failed to receive any benefit whatever from the\r\nordinary resources of medical science. He died on December 30, 1644.\r\n\r\nI do not feel equal to the task of expounding Van Helmont’s often very\r\nobscure theories regarding the physical and psychological processes\r\nthat take place in the human being; regarding the distinctions which he\r\nmakes between the “_archaeus influus_”--the regulating principle\r\nwhich governs all the psychical and physiological processes in the\r\nbody--and the “_archaeus insitus_”--the subsidiary power which\r\nresides in each individual part of the body, but which at the same time\r\nis under the control of the “_archaeus influus_”; and regarding\r\nthe doctrine that disease is the result of an “_idea morbosa_” of\r\nthe “_archaeus influus_.” August Hirsch says that in developing\r\nthese theories Van Helmont puts forward many bright ideas, which\r\nunfortunately lead one into a wilderness of fantastic, theosophic\r\nconcepts. If sufficient time and space were at my command it might\r\nbe interesting to separate some of these bright thoughts from the\r\nextravagances in which they are buried, and thus demonstrate the truth\r\nof the statements made by both Hirsch and Dezeimeris to the effect\r\nthat Van Helmont, in matters relating to physiology and pathology, was\r\nunquestionably a precise and critical observer, a sound thinker, and a\r\ncorrect interpreter; but the plan of the present work will not permit\r\nme to enter into all these details. I can only quote a few of the\r\nteachings or sayings to which Hirsch refers:--\r\n\r\n   Digestion does not, as Galen maintains, depend upon heat, but\r\n   upon a certain ferment existing in the gastric juice.\r\n\r\n   Heat is not, as has hitherto been taught, the cause of life, but\r\n   rather one of its products.\r\n\r\n   The final cause of the sensory phenomena of life is the\r\n   _archaeus influus_, which, while it is inseparably\r\n   united with matter, nevertheless does not represent the soul\r\n   itself, but rather the organ of the soul, and is seated in the\r\n   “duumvirate” of the spleen and the stomach.\r\n\r\n   Disease, in order to acquire sufficient power to antagonize\r\n   life effectively, must unite its forces with the _archaeus\r\n   influus_.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed that Van Helmont, more than any other teacher\r\nof medicine, was instrumental in giving the deathblow to the\r\npractice--which prevailed in all the medical schools of that day--of\r\nteaching the obsolescent Galenic doctrines, and that for this valuable\r\nservice alone he deserves full recognition at the hands of the medical\r\nprofession of to-day. But, as we learn from Ernest von Meyer’s history\r\nof chemistry, Van Helmont has a much stronger claim for recognition in\r\nthe fact that he made many important contributions to iatrochemistry\r\nand also to fundamental or pure chemistry. Taking one thing with\r\nanother, says von Meyer, we may safely assert that Van Helmont’s\r\nuseful contributions to the medical and chemical sciences by far\r\noutweigh those which are of a fantastic or useless nature. It was he,\r\nfor example, who materially increased our knowledge of the nature of\r\ncarbonic acid. He demonstrated how it may be extracted from limestone\r\nor from potash by the aid of acids, from burning coal, and from wine\r\nand beer while they are undergoing fermentation. He also showed that\r\nit is present in the stomach, in various mineral waters, and in\r\nhollows in the earth. He gave it the name of “_gas sylvestre_.”\r\nHe would doubtless have carried his discoveries much farther along if\r\nhe had possessed the apparatus which is required for such researches.\r\nHowever, despite the lack of these facilities, he was able to describe\r\nhydrogen and marsh gas as special varieties which do not possess the\r\nsame composition as ordinary air. Finally, in his treatise entitled\r\n“_Pharmacopolium ac dispensatorium modernum_” will be found\r\na goodly number of useful instructions as to the proper manner of\r\npreparing drugs.\r\n\r\nA complete collection of his writings was published at Amsterdam by his\r\nson, in 1648, under the title “_Ortus medicinae vel opera et opuscula\r\nomnia_.”\r\n\r\nTheophrast von Hohenheim--who is known everywhere throughout the\r\nworld as “Paracelsus”--was the son of Wilhelm Bombast von Hohenheim,\r\na physician who belonged to one of the noble families of the Duchy\r\nof Württemberg. He was born in 1493 at a spot called “_Das Hohe\r\nNest_” (the lofty nest) in the Canton of Schwyz, about one hour’s\r\ndistance from the celebrated monastery or cloister of Einsiedeln, of\r\nwhich institution his father was the official physician. Switzerland,\r\ntherefore, has a right to claim Paracelsus as one of her sons. In 1502\r\nhis father transferred his home to Villach, in Carinthia (to the east\r\nof Tyrol), and continued to live there up to the time of his death in\r\n1534. It is not known where the son obtained his degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine. It is a well-established fact, however, that he received the\r\nfirst part of his training as a chemist from Johann Trietheim, the\r\nPrior of Sponheim, and his subsequent education in the laboratory of\r\nSigmund Fugger, the cultivated owner of wines at Schwatz in the Tyrol.\r\nHe traveled all over Europe, going from one university to another and\r\nmaking the acquaintance of people who were well informed in matters\r\nrelating to natural history, chemistry and metallurgy; and during all\r\nthis time he appears to have absorbed a great deal of information\r\nrelating to almost every department of human knowledge. Finally in\r\n1526, soon after he had returned to Switzerland, he received, through\r\nthe aid of certain influential citizens, two important official\r\npositions in Basel,--that of City Physician and that of Professor of\r\nMedicine and Surgery in the University. To the surprise of all, and\r\ncontrary to long-established custom, he delivered his lectures in\r\nGerman and not in Latin. This action on his part called forth bitter\r\ncriticism from the university authorities, but at first it met with the\r\napproval of the students. During the following two years, however, he\r\ngradually became unpopular with all classes of the community, and was\r\nfinally obliged to leave Basel. Haeser attributes this unpopularity\r\nto Paracelsus’ rough manners, to his intolerance of the opinions of\r\nhis colleagues, and to his tirades against the apothecaries for their\r\nexcessive charges. It is very difficult to determine how far jealousy\r\nwas responsible for the state of affairs which I have just described.\r\nCabanès, the author of an admirable biography of Paracelsus (_Revue\r\nScientifique_, Paris, May 19, 1894), gives his own estimate of this\r\nremarkable man’s character in the following terms: “Poor, miserable,\r\nand persecuted during his lifetime, he was misunderstood even after\r\nhis death, and was calumniated by history.” Paracelsus evidently\r\nbelieved it to be his bounden duty to destroy the then prevailing cult\r\nof Aristotle, Galen and Avicenna as the great teachers in medicine;\r\nand, filled with this idea, he prophesied the growth of a new science\r\nof medicine on the ruins of their teachings. It is stated that the\r\nstudents, after one of these excited lectures, made a bonfire and\r\nburned a number of copies of the works of these famous authors, thus\r\nshowing that Paracelsus was sufficiently eloquent to infuse some of\r\nhis own reforming spirit into the minds of his auditors. He made\r\na great mistake, however, when he attacked in a similarly violent\r\nmanner the shortcomings of many of his contemporaries. “The medical\r\nprofession,” he said, “has become a mere money-making business.” As a\r\nnatural result of such tirades, Paracelsus was forced to leave Basel.\r\nHe fled first to Colmar in Alsace and at a later date took refuge in\r\nSt. Gall, Switzerland; and it was while he resided in that city that\r\nhe published three books of his “_Paramirum_.” Then in 1535 he\r\nonce more resumed his wandering life, in the course of which he visited\r\nPoland, Lithuania, Illyria, etc. On reaching Salzburg, in Austria, he\r\nfell ill and died on September 24, 1541, at the age of forty-eight.\r\n\r\nParacelsus was a prolific writer. To all the treatises which he\r\npublished he gave extravagant titles. To his principal work, for\r\nexample, he gave that of “_Paramirum_”--The Surprising Marvel;\r\nto another, that of “_Paragranum_”--Grain of Superior Quality;\r\nand to a third, that of “_Archidoxia_,”--Transcendental Science.\r\nHe wrote treatises on syphilis, on the plague, on epidemics, on the\r\ndiseases of grave-diggers, on ore-smelters, etc. It is admitted by all\r\nhis critics that he devoted altogether too much time and thought to\r\nalchemy, demonology, necromancy, etc. Cabanès quotes Cruveilhier as\r\nsaying that Paracelsus believed in the reality of beings of a fantastic\r\nnature, but attached little or no importance to them. Then Cabanès\r\nhimself adds: “The thing which more than anything else absorbed his\r\nthoughts was the irresistible desire to overthrow the Galenic idol\r\nand substitute for it the science of experience, of observation pure\r\nand simple.” Bordes-Pagès, another distinguished French physician,\r\nsays of this extraordinary man: “The great glory of Paracelsus is to\r\nbe found in the facts that he cast off the yoke of a former epoch,\r\nmore speculative than practical; that he summoned physicians to resume\r\ntheir allegiance to experience; and that he opened a long career\r\nfor the alchemists, upon whom he urged the duty thenceforward of\r\nmaking new remedies the principal object of their researches.... He\r\nsimplified and spiritualized therapeutics.” Some of Paracelsus’ own\r\nsayings are worth preserving: “Without air all living creatures would\r\nperish from suffocation.” “Man is the supreme animal, the one last\r\ncreated.” “_Alterius non sit, qui suus esse potest_” [He who is\r\nable to be his own master should not allow himself to be led blindly by\r\nanother]. When he was accused of being coarse-grained and of deceiving\r\nthe people, he replied: “By nature and also owing to the kind of\r\npeople with whom I associated in my youth I am not of a finely-spun\r\ntexture.... We were not nourished with figs and white bread, but with\r\ncheese, milk and black bread-food that does not make delicate lads....\r\nThey say of me that I lead the people astray, that I am possessed of a\r\ndevil, that I am a sorcerer, and that I am a magician. Whatever truth\r\nthere may be in these charges, one thing is certain: You are all of you\r\nunworthy to unloose the latchets of my shoes.” (From _Paragranum_,\r\nII., 120.)\r\n\r\nOporinus, who acted for a long time as Paracelsus’ assistant, made the\r\nfollowing statements with regard to some of the methods of his former\r\nmaster:--\r\n\r\n   He always kept several preparations stewing on his furnace--as,\r\n   for example, a sublimate of oil or of arsenic, a mixture\r\n   of saffron and iron, or his marvelous Opedeldoch. He never\r\n   prescribed a special diet nor any hygienic measures. As a purge\r\n   he gave a precipitate of theriaca or of mithridate, or simply\r\n   the juice of cherries or grapes, in the form of granules (about\r\n   the size of the droppings of mice), and he was careful always\r\n   to give them in uneven numbers (1, 3, or 5). He was bitterly\r\n   opposed to the polypharmacy which prevailed so widely in his day.\r\n\r\nCabanès says that we probably owe to Paracelsus an increased knowledge\r\nof the virtues possessed by the different preparations of antimony,\r\nmercury and iron, and by salines. It was he who created the distinction\r\nbetween officinal and magistral preparations. To our list of\r\npharmaceutical preparations, he added tincture of hellebore, compound\r\ntincture of aloes, digestive ointment, the tincture of metals (“Lilium”\r\nof Paracelsus), the “Saffron of Mars,” etc. He was the inventor of the\r\nprecious preparation known as “_la mumie_,” a preparation which\r\nwas popularly believed to possess marvelous healing powers. Ambroise\r\nParé, toward the end of his career, was greatly blamed because he did\r\nnot employ this remedy, and he was finally compelled in self-defense to\r\nwrite a pamphlet on the subject. (The text is reprinted in Malgaigne’s\r\n“_Ambroise Paré_,” under the title of “_Traité de la mumie et de\r\nla licorne_.”)\r\n\r\nAdolphe Gubler of Paris credits Paracelsus with the distinction of\r\nhaving been the first physician to give an impetus to the movement\r\nwhich had for its object the application of chemistry to the perfection\r\nof medicinal preparations. He also maintains that Paracelsus should be\r\nlooked upon as in a large degree the originator of specific remedies,\r\nand that he is justly entitled to the distinction of having been the\r\nfirst publicly to announce the “quintessences”--that is, the active\r\nprinciples (vegetable alkaloids)--of drugs. According to this claim\r\nit is understood that Paracelsus taught that each drug contained a\r\nspecially active elementary body which it was possible to extract\r\nas a separate substance. Acting upon this belief Paracelsus did not\r\nhesitate to give the preference to the pharmaceutical preparations\r\nknown as “tinctures”--that is, alcoholic extracts. Great credit is\r\nalso due to Paracelsus for his rejection of the doctrine that guaiac\r\nis an efficient remedy against syphilis, and for his insistence that\r\nmercury is the only useful agent in curing that disease. Tartar emetic\r\n(potassium antimonyl tartrate) is one of the drugs the introduction of\r\nwhich into our pharmacopoeia should be credited to Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest references to genuine diphtheria is to be found in\r\nthe writings of Paracelsus, who speaks of the disease in the following\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n   When this disease is located in an external wound it not\r\n   infrequently spreads to the muscles of the larynx; and, _vice\r\n   versa_, when a person has the disease in his throat, and at\r\n   the same time happens to have an external wound, the malady is\r\n   likely to spread to the wound.\r\n\r\nParacelsus’ idea of the existence of an “_archaeus_,” a power\r\nwhich presides over all physiological actions as well as over all\r\nthe operations of medicinal drugs, resembles very closely the “vital\r\nforce,” or “animism” so strongly championed by Stahl in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFrom all that I have said above regarding the excitable nature of\r\nParacelsus it seems almost a waste of time to tell our readers that his\r\ncontributions to the science of surgery were of very slight value. He\r\ndespised the study of anatomy, claiming that a knowledge of this branch\r\nof medical science was not essential to a proper acquaintance with the\r\nhuman body. “To dissect,” he once remarked, “was a peasant’s manner of\r\nprocedure.” (Cabanès.) His surgery, as one may imagine, showed clearly\r\nthe bad effects of such beliefs.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the nineteenth century there developed\r\namong the leading men of the medical profession a sentiment in favor\r\nof honoring the memory of Paracelsus by the erection of a suitable\r\nmonument at Basel, Switzerland, the city in which he made his first\r\npublic appearance. The project met with a favorable reception and the\r\nstatue is now an accomplished fact. This is a remarkable instance of\r\ntardy justice being rendered to the memory of a physician who, for\r\nthree hundred years, was almost universally looked upon as a vain,\r\nhalf-crazy man.\r\n\r\nThe next advances of any special importance in the department of\r\nchemistry were made in Great Britain by Robert Boyle, who was born\r\nat Lismore, County of Cork, Ireland, on January 25, 1626. He was the\r\nfourteenth child of the Earl of Cork. His early training was obtained\r\nat Eton, and then afterward he spent two years at Geneva, Switzerland,\r\nin prosecuting his scientific studies. In 1654 he entered Oxford\r\nUniversity and became intimately acquainted with some of the most\r\nlearned men of that day. While he was a student at the university he\r\nbecame a member of what was known as “The Invisible College,” a society\r\nwhich was influential in bringing about the founding of “The Royal\r\nSociety,” of which organization he was president from the year 1680 to\r\nthe time of his death in 1691.\r\n\r\nBoyle was endowed with a noble character--modest, religious and\r\ngenerous. He gained distinction as a chemist in several departments.\r\nApplied chemistry is indebted to him for a number of important\r\ncontributions; he added to our knowledge of chemical combinations and\r\nto the methods of analyzing them; he enriched the chemistry of gases\r\nand also pharmacology; and he gave a clear and easily intelligible\r\ndefinition of what a “chemical element” is. He laid stress upon the\r\ndoctrine that a chemical combination represents the union of two\r\ncomponent elements, and that this combination possesses characteristics\r\nquite different from those possessed by either of the two component\r\nelements. Before his day there was practically no such thing as\r\nanalytical chemistry, and it is to Boyle that we owe the establishment\r\nof a clear conception of what the terms “chemical reaction” and\r\n“chemical analysis” signify. The part played by atmospheric air in\r\ncombustion was made by him the subject of numerous experiments which\r\nproved later to be of great assistance in the final solution of the\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\nIn one of his writings Boyle says in substance that if men would devote\r\ntheir energies to carrying out experiments and collecting observations,\r\nrather than to the constructing of theories without having previously\r\ntested with thoroughness the grounds upon which they believe them to\r\nbe based, the world would be greatly the gainer. The promulgation\r\nand insistence upon the importance of this doctrine for the growth\r\nof the science of chemistry constitute--so those competent to judge\r\nclaim--Boyle’s greatest merit in scientific work and his most important\r\ncontribution to chemistry.\r\n\r\nAmong the chemical treatises which Boyle wrote and published the\r\nfollowing deserve to receive special mention: “Sceptical Chymist,”\r\n1661; “_Tentamina quaedam physiologica_,” 1661; “_Experimenta\r\net considerationes de coloribus_,” 1663; and “Medical Experiments,”\r\n1692–1698. Although Boyle was not an avowed follower of Bacon, he\r\ncarried out thoroughly the principles which the latter taught.\r\n\r\nRaymond Minderer, a practicing physician in Augsburg, Germany\r\n(1570–1621), deserves the credit of having added to our stock of\r\nremedies the acetate of ammonia (_liquor ammonii acetatis_).\r\nDiluted with an equal quantity of water it is still employed to-day as\r\na remedy under the name of “Spirit of Mindererus.” He was the compiler,\r\nin 1613, of the Augsburg Pharmacopoeia.\r\n\r\n_General Therapeutics.--Transfusion.--The Discovery of Cinchona\r\nand Ipecacuanha._--In the department of general therapeutics, as\r\nwe learn from Berendes, several important new measures were brought\r\nforward during the seventeenth century; and among these the following\r\ndeserve to receive brief mention in this place: the operation of\r\ntransfusing blood from a healthy individual to one who is ill; the\r\nintroduction of cinchona into the European pharmacopoeia as an\r\nefficient remedy in the treatment of certain fevers; the similar\r\nintroduction of another South American drug--viz., ipecacuanha; and\r\nthe invention of many medico-chemical products and the improvement of\r\nothers that were already in common use.\r\n\r\nAs regards the operation of transfusion, from which great things were\r\nexpected, Sir Christopher Wren (1632–1723), the famous architect and\r\nastronomer of London, is reported to have been the first person to\r\nurge a trial of this procedure. On the other hand, Robert Boyle, the\r\nchemist, actually performed the operation on animals. He followed the\r\nmethod suggested by Richard Lower (1631–1691) of England, viz., by\r\nallowing the blood to flow from the carotid artery of one animal into\r\nthe jugular vein of a second animal; while Edmund King adopted the\r\nplan of allowing the blood to pass from the jugular vein of one animal\r\ninto the corresponding vein of a second animal. Upon a human being the\r\noperation was probably performed for the first time (in 1666) by Denys,\r\nProfessor of Philosophy and Mathematics in Paris. Repetitions of the\r\noperation were made, two or three years later, in London and in Rome,\r\nbut they produced no good effects and in some instances they terminated\r\nin the death of the individual for whose benefit the operation had\r\nbeen performed. In 1668 the French Parliament and the Papal Government\r\nforbade a repetition of the operation.\r\n\r\nIn 1638--so the story runs--the wife of Count Cinchon, Viceroy of Peru,\r\nwas cured of a stubborn intermittent fever by the native physicians,\r\nwho employed, in their treatment of the malady, the bark of the tree\r\nnow universally known by the name of “Cinchona.” In 1640 Juan del\r\nVego, the regular medical attendant of Count Cinchon, introduced\r\nthe new remedy into Spain, but it was not until after the lapse of\r\nabout fourteen years that the drug found its way into England and\r\nCentral Europe. The price at which it could be purchased was at first\r\nvery high; it was almost literally “worth its weight in gold.” Even\r\nas late as 1680 the bark sold in England for £8 sterling per pound.\r\nNotwithstanding the generally recognized value of the drug in the\r\ntreatment of certain fevers there were not a few men who continued\r\nfor many years to oppose its use. Thus, Johann Kanold, a practitioner\r\nof medicine in Breslau, Germany, is reported to have said, on his\r\ndeath-bed in 1729, that he would rather die than be cured by a remedy\r\nthe action of which was so opposed to all the principles which he\r\nconsidered right in therapeutics.\r\n\r\nIpecacuanha, another very important drug, was added to our stock of\r\nremedial agents toward the end of the seventeenth century. It was\r\nbrought into France from Brazil, in 1672, by a French physician named\r\nLe Gras, but its value as a remedy for the cure of dysentery did not\r\nbegin to be appreciated until after Helvetius, a semi-quack, had sold\r\nto Louis the Fourteenth, for one thousand louis-d’or (about $4000),\r\nthe formula for the preparation which he (Helvetius) had been using\r\nwith great success during the recent epidemic of that disease, and\r\nwhich moreover had effected a remarkably rapid cure in the case of\r\nthe King’s own son--the Dauphin. After the purchase had been made by\r\nLouis the Fourteenth, in the interest of the French people in general,\r\nit was ascertained that the only active reagent among the ingredients\r\nof the formula was ipecac, a drug with which the Paris physicians had\r\nlong been more or less familiar. Ipecac, it will also doubtless be\r\nremembered, constitutes the important element in what is known as the\r\nEast Indian treatment of dysentery.\r\n\r\nProbably the earliest modern treatise on matters connected\r\nwith pharmacy is that which bears the title “_Onomasticon\r\nLatino-Germanico-Polonicum rerum ad artem pharmaceuticam\r\npertinentium_.” It was published about the year 1600, and its author\r\nwas Paul Guldinus.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important iatrochemical authorities of the seventeenth\r\ncentury was Johann Rudolf Glauber (1604–1668), to whom we are indebted\r\nfor the invention or improvement of a large number of medico-chemical\r\nproducts. The well-known “Glauber’s salt” may be named as one of these\r\nproducts, and chloride of iron as another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n     SOME OF THE LEADERS IN MEDICINE IN ITALY, FRANCE AND ENGLAND\r\n            DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eminent French Physicians._--Among the physicians of France who\r\nattained a widespread and well-grounded celebrity throughout Europe\r\nduring the sixteenth century, Pierre Brissot deserves to be given\r\nthe first place. He was born in 1478 at Fontenay-le-Comte, not far\r\nfrom Rochelle, and was a professor of medicine at Paris. He attained\r\nconsiderable distinction, during the sixteenth century, by his advocacy\r\nof the superiority of the Hippocratic method of bloodletting over that\r\nintroduced--or, rather, perpetuated--by the practitioners of that day\r\nin Central Europe. The rule which was laid down by Hippocrates was\r\nto the effect that, in venesection, the blood should be drawn from\r\nthe vein lying nearest to the part inflamed. The Greek physicians\r\nof a later period forgot all about this rule and adopted in its\r\nplace one that was based on the doctrine that venesection practiced\r\nin the vicinity of a focus of inflammation favors a determination\r\nof blood to that part and therefore does only harm; and they\r\naccordingly--especially in cases of pleuritis--abstracted blood from\r\nthe arm on the side opposite to that on which the disease was located,\r\nor from one of the veins of the foot. This new rule was subsequently\r\nadopted by the Arabian physicians, and it remained in full force up to\r\nthe end of the sixteenth century. A wide experience in the treatment of\r\nthe epidemic pleuritis which raged in Paris in 1514 confirmed Brissot\r\nin the belief that the Hippocratic method is the one to be preferred;\r\nbut, despite his pleadings, the Parisian physicians refused to adopt\r\nthe method which he advocated and used their influence in securing from\r\nthe French Parliament an order forbidding him to continue employing it\r\nin Paris. Discouraged by the treatment which he experienced in that\r\ncity, Brissot removed to Lisbon in Portugal, and soon had occasion\r\n(in the epidemic which raged at Evora in 1516) further to satisfy\r\nhimself that the Hippocratic rule is the correct one. But here too he\r\nencountered bitter opposition on the part of the Portuguese physicians;\r\nhis most active opponent being Dionysius, the Physician-in-Ordinary\r\nto the King. Brissot then wrote an elaborate defense of the method\r\nwhich he advocated, and this treatise was submitted to the judgment of\r\nthe Medical Faculty of the University of Salamanca. When the decision\r\nof this learned body was given in Brissot’s favor, his opponents,\r\ndissatisfied with the result, made still another effort to gain\r\ntheir point, viz., by appealing to the Emperor Charles the Fifth.\r\nThey assured his Majesty that the Brissot Heresy, as they termed it,\r\nwas fully as dangerous to the cause of humanity as that championed\r\nby Luther. But here again they failed. This final victory, however,\r\nbrought no satisfaction to Brissot, who died of dysentery in 1522,\r\njust before the decision was rendered. Haeser speaks of this unusually\r\nbitter dispute as one of the last of the violent battles which occurred\r\nbetween the adherents of the Arabian physicians and the supporters of\r\nthe teachings of Hippocrates, and which terminated in “a most brilliant\r\nvictory of experience over Arabian dogmatism.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 16. “THE LOVESICK MAIDEN.”\r\n\r\n  (After the painting by Jan Steen, 1626–1679.)\r\n\r\n  One of this famous Dutch artist’s objects, in painting the scene\r\n  here represented, was to satirize the practice, which was very\r\n  prevalent among certain physicians of that period, of pretending\r\n  to diagnose all sorts of maladies from the mere naked-eye\r\n  inspection of his patient’s urine.\r\n\r\n  (Courtesy of Dr. Eugen Hollander, author of _Die Medizin in\r\n  der klassischen Malerei_, Stuttgart, 1903.)]\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the sixteenth century there developed a\r\nbelief, among the more ignorant physicians, that, in many cases of\r\nillness, important information may be derived from a simple naked-eye\r\ninspection of the patent’s urine as exposed to view in a flask-shaped\r\nglass vessel. In the Hippocratic writings no adequate grounds for\r\nsuch a belief are discoverable, but in one of Galen’s treatises there\r\nhave been found statements which appear(?) to give some sanction to\r\nthis new idea. However this may be, it is an established fact that\r\nuroscopy was taken up at the time named with great zeal by all the\r\nquacks in the land and by large numbers of practitioners of medicine\r\nwho saw in this procedure an easy and safe method of bettering their\r\nfortunes. The public at large were greatly impressed with this new and\r\nwonderful manner of detecting disease, and for a long period--indeed,\r\nfor more than half a century--this piece of clap-trap charlatanry\r\ncontinued to thrive, and to reflect only discredit upon the medical\r\nprofession. There came a time, however, when people generally began\r\nto suspect that uroscopy was not all that the charlatans claimed it\r\nto be, and these suspicions were voiced in the popular saying, “The\r\npulse is good, the urine is normal, and yet the patient dies.” The\r\nwriters who were the most active in showing up the hollowness of\r\nthe claims of the uroscopists were Scribonius of Marburg, Germany,\r\nPeter Foreest (1522–1597) of Alkmaar, Holland, and Leonardo Botallo\r\nof Asti, in Piedmont (born in 1530). The latter authority, it may be\r\nrecalled, owes his chief distinction to the fact that he rediscovered\r\nwhat has been erroneously named in his honor the “_foramen\r\nBotalli_”--_i.e._, the _ductus arteriosus_ in the foetus.\r\nHe also attained some distinction in another direction. He revived\r\nthe violent disputes about venesection by recommending a resort to\r\nthis therapeutic procedure in nearly all illnesses. He went so far\r\nas to advocate four or five bloodlettings in the course of an acute\r\nattack, in each one of which operations from three to four pounds\r\nof blood should, as he believed, be abstracted. Indeed, he claimed\r\nthat in an extreme case it might be perfectly proper to abstract as\r\nmuch as _seventeen pounds_(!). Inasmuch as Botallo’s practice\r\nwas largely confined to the strong soldiers of Northern Italy it is\r\neasier to understand how such extravagant bloodletting did not more\r\noften prove fatal than it did. When, soon afterward, the Paris Faculty\r\ncondemned the practice in the strongest possible terms, Botallo’s\r\nfollowers characterized sarcastically the French physicians as “pigmy\r\nbloodletters” (_petits saigneurs_).\r\n\r\nBut the efforts of Scribonius, Botallo and others to put an end to the\r\nuroscopy scandal were--I fully believe--not the only or perhaps even\r\nthe most potent factors in bringing about the suppression of the evil.\r\nAs many of our readers will remember, the art collections of European\r\ncapitals contain admirably painted specimens of Dutch and Flemish\r\ngenre pictures representing every phase of this uroscopic fraud, and\r\nthese striking masterpieces, revealing, as they undoubtedly did to the\r\ncommunity at large, the ridiculous character of the claims made by the\r\ncharlatans, could scarcely have failed to give a deadly blow to the\r\nfraud. (See Fig. 17.)\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the sixteenth century Jean Fernel of Amiens\r\n(1497–1558) was one of the leading medical authorities of France.\r\nAfter receiving his degree of Doctor of Medicine at Paris, in 1530,\r\nhe settled in that city and soon acquired considerable reputation,\r\nnot only as a practitioner but also as a lecturer. In 1545 he was\r\ncalled upon to take charge, professionally, of Diane de Poitiers, the\r\nmistress of Henry, the son of Francis the First, King of France. About\r\nthe same time he was asked to serve as First Physician to the Dauphin,\r\nbut he was not disposed to accept the latter position, as he disliked\r\nthe duties of the office and also because he feared that they would\r\ninterfere with his favorite studies. He pleaded poor health, and his\r\nexcuse was accepted as valid. That Fernel was held in very high esteem\r\nby the royal family is evident from the events which succeeded this\r\nrefusal. In the first place, it was insisted that he should accept\r\nthe stipend (600 livres) attached to the office, as a mark of the\r\nroyal favor; and then, in 1547, when Henry was crowned king (Henry the\r\nSecond), Fernel was urged to become his First Physician; but again he\r\ndeclined the honor, this time on the ground that Louis de Bourges,\r\nwho had held the position with great credit under Francis the First\r\n(Henry’s father), was entitled to be retained in office. The King\r\nyielded to Fernel’s generous intervention in behalf of de Bourges.\r\nBut in 1556, when the latter died, Fernel felt obliged to accept the\r\nposition which had then become vacant; and from that time forward,\r\nuntil the time of his death on April 26, 1558, he accompanied the\r\nKing on all his military expeditions. As he did not possess a robust\r\nconstitution, his health suffered not a little from the frequent\r\nexposures to hardships of all sorts to which he was subjected; and, in\r\naddition, during this long period he saw very little of his wife to\r\nwhom he was devotedly attached.\r\n\r\nFernel is universally admitted by French physicians to have been one\r\nof the most cultivated teachers and practitioners of medicine of his\r\nday. He was a very clear writer, and would doubtless have made a number\r\nof valuable additions to the science if he had not been carried off by\r\nillness at a comparatively early age.\r\n\r\nOf his published writings the following are reckoned the most\r\nimportant: “_Universa medicina_,” Paris, 1567; “_De abditis\r\nrerum causis_,” Paris, 1548, and “_Therapeutices universalis seu\r\nmedendi rationis libri VII._,” Paris, 1554. (Many editions of each\r\nof these works were published.)\r\n\r\nIn his discussion of various questions relating to physiology Fernel\r\nmaintains that the component elements of the body are vivified by means\r\nof heat, and he elaborates this idea very much in the same manner as\r\nHippocrates does that of the “_callidum innatum_.” The spiritual\r\nlife, he says, is presided over by the soul (“_anima_”). When he\r\ncomes, however, to consider the individual powers of the soul, Fernel\r\ntreats the subject exactly as does Galen. He gives expression to one\r\nrather bright idea: “The specific functions of each of the different\r\norgans may be inferred in large measure from the character of the\r\nstructural elements of which they are composed.”\r\n\r\nIn his scheme of pathology Fernel divides diseases into _simple_\r\n(“_similares_”)--diseases of the tissues; _compound_\r\n(“_organici_”)--diseases involving entire organs; and\r\n_complicated_ (“_communes_”)--diseases in which the normal\r\nrelations between the different parts are broken up.\r\n\r\nIn the chapter which Fernel devotes to the subject of therapeutics,\r\nthere is a section relating to venesection which, according to Haeser,\r\nis well worth reading, as it reveals the power of the writer to grasp\r\nthe leading points and to reason correctly from them.\r\n\r\n_Two English Physicians Who Became Famous During the Sixteenth\r\nCentury._--In the early part of the sixteenth century the medical\r\nprofession of Great Britain was in a most unsatisfactory state.\r\nHumbuggery, ignorance and superstition were at that period of time\r\nthe most prominent characteristics of the majority of physicians\r\nupon whom the people at large had to depend for the relief or\r\ncure of their bodily ailments, and there were very few and very\r\nuntrustworthy measures in force for the production of a better class of\r\npractitioners. Just at this juncture there appeared on the scene a man\r\nwho was eminently well equipped to rescue England from this lamentable\r\nstate of affairs and to put her on the high road to the acquisition of\r\nan honorable body of medical men and of a corps of apothecaries who\r\ncould be trusted to dispense pure drugs properly compounded. I refer\r\nto Thomas Linacre, who was born at Canterbury in 1461 or 1462, was a\r\nFellow of All Souls College, Oxford, and a graduate of the University\r\nof Padua, and whose biography is sketched by John Freind (1675–1728) in\r\nsuch an admirably clear, concise and appreciative manner that I cannot\r\ndo better--in view of the great importance of this event in the history\r\nof medicine in England--than to reproduce it here in considerable\r\nfulness of detail.\r\n\r\n   Thomas Linacre was a man of a bright genius and a clear\r\n   understanding, as well as unusual knowledge in different parts\r\n   of learning: ... and, being very desirous to make further\r\n   improvements by travelling, he thought he could no where succeed\r\n   in his designs so well as by going to Italy, which began then\r\n   to be famous for reviving the ancient Greek and Roman learning.\r\n   There he was treated with extraordinary kindness by Lorenzo\r\n   de Medicis, one of the politest men in his age and a great\r\n   patron of letters; who favoured him so far in his studies as\r\n   to give him the privilege of having the same preceptors with\r\n   his own sons. Linacre knew how to make all his advantages of\r\n   so lucky an opportunity; and accordingly, by the instructions\r\n   of Demetrius Chalcondylas, a native of Greece, he acquired a\r\n   perfect knowledge of the Greek tongue; and so far improved under\r\n   his Latin master Politian, as to arrive to a greater correctness\r\n   of style than even Politian himself....\r\n\r\n   Having laid in such an uncommon stock of learning, he applied\r\n   himself to the study of natural philosophy and physick;\r\n   particularly he made it his business, and was the first\r\n   Englishman who ever did so, to be well acquainted with the\r\n   original works of Aristotle and Galen. He translated and\r\n   published several tracts of the latter....\r\n\r\n   In his own Faculty he distinguished himself so much that, soon\r\n   after his return, he was pitched upon by that wise king, Henry\r\n   the Seventh, as the fittest person to be placed about Prince\r\n   Arthur, and to take care both of his health and his education.\r\n   He was afterward made successively Physician to that king, to\r\n   his successor Henry the Eighth, and to the Princess Mary....\r\n   And indeed, as he was perfectly skilled himself in his own art,\r\n   so he always shewed a remarkable kindness for all those who\r\n   bent their studies that way; and wherever he found, in young\r\n   students, any ingenuity, learning, modesty, good manners, and a\r\n   desire to excel, he assisted them with his advice, his interest,\r\n   and his purse. And to give a still stronger proof, how much he\r\n   had the good of his own Profession and that of the Publick at\r\n   heart, he founded two _Lectures of Physick_ in Oxford, and\r\n   one at Cambridge....\r\n\r\n   But he had still further views for the advantage of our\r\n   Profession: he saw in how low a condition the practice of\r\n   Physick then was, that it was mostly engrossed by illiterate\r\n   monks and empiricks, who in an infamous manner imposed on the\r\n   Publick; the Bishop of London or the Dean of St. Paul’s for the\r\n   time being, having the chief power in approving and admitting\r\n   the practitioners in London, and the rest of the bishops in\r\n   their several dioceses. And he found that there was no way\r\n   left of redressing this grievance, but by giving encouragement\r\n   to men of reputation and learning, and placing this power of\r\n   licensing in more proper hands. Upon these motives he projected\r\n   the foundations of our College [of Physicians]; and using\r\n   his interest at Court, particularly with that great patriot\r\n   and munificent promoter of all learning, Cardinal Wolsey, he\r\n   procured Letters Patent from the King, which were confirmed\r\n   by Parliament, to establish a corporate Society of Physicians\r\n   in this city, by virtue of which authority the College, as a\r\n   corporation, now enjoys the sole privilege of admitting all\r\n   persons whatever to the practice of physick, as well as that\r\n   of supervising all prescriptions. And it is expressly declared\r\n   that no one shall be admitted to exercise physick in any of\r\n   the dioceses in England, out of London, till such time that he\r\n   be examined by the President and three of the Elects, and have\r\n   letters testimonial from them, unless he be a graduate in either\r\n   University, who, as such, by his very Degree, has a right to\r\n   practice all over England, except within seven miles of London,\r\n   without being obliged to take any license from the Bishop....\r\n\r\n   By other Acts another weighty affair is committed to the care of\r\n   the College, [viz.,] the visiting of shops and the inspection of\r\n   medicines; a thing surely of as much consequence at least to the\r\n   patient as to the prescriber....\r\n\r\n   Linacre was the first president of his new-erected college, and\r\n   held that office for the seven years he lived after.... And\r\n   perhaps no Founder ever had the good fortune to have his designs\r\n   succeed more to his wish; this society has constantly produced\r\n   one set of men after another, who have done both credit and\r\n   service to their country by their practice and their writings.\r\n\r\nIf further evidence be needed to show what was the type of mind\r\npossessed by this remarkable English physician, I may be permitted to\r\nquote here a single brief statement made by his friend Erasmus, the\r\nfamous Dutch scholar and theologian, in a letter addressed to John\r\nFisher, Chancellor of Cambridge University: “Linacre is as deep and\r\nacute a thinker as I have ever met with.”\r\n\r\nIn England, during the seventeenth century, there appeared on the scene\r\nonly one practicing physician of such conspicuous ability and of so\r\nmarked personal traits of character as to place his name, after the\r\nlapse of a few years from the time of his death, and by the almost\r\nunanimous assent of his associates, high up on the roll of honor. I\r\nrefer to the famous physician Sydenham.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 17. THOMAS SYDENHAM.\r\n\r\n  (After the portrait in the hall of All Souls’ College, Oxford.)]\r\n\r\nThomas Sydenham was born at Wynford Eagle, Dorsetshire, England, in\r\n1624. At the age of eighteen he entered Magdalen College, Oxford,\r\nand remained there until 1644, when he enlisted in the Parliamentary\r\nArmy. After a brief military service, he resumed his studies at the\r\nuniversity and received his Bachelor’s degree in 1648. It was only at\r\na much later date (1676), however, that he was given (after he had\r\npursued the prescribed course of studies) the degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine,--and then not by Oxford, but by Cambridge. After leaving\r\nthe university he first spent a few months at the Medical School of\r\nMontpellier, France, and then settled (1666) in London as a practicing\r\nphysician, the necessary license having been granted him by the\r\nCollege of Physicians. His first medical treatise, which bore the title\r\n“_Methodus Curandi Febres_” [Method of Treating Fevers], was\r\npublished in 1666. The third edition of this work was issued ten years\r\nlater, but with the title changed to “_Observationes Medicae_\r\netc.” Between 1666 and 1683 he published several other treatises,\r\nthe more important of which deal with epidemic diseases--syphilis,\r\nsmall-pox, hysteria and gout.\r\n\r\nDuring the later period of Sydenham’s career he attained great\r\ncelebrity as a physician; but this celebrity would have been\r\nshort-lived if it had rested on nothing more substantial than mere\r\ncleverness and professional success. As a matter of fact he had brought\r\nabout, by his teaching and also by his example, a most important\r\nrevolution in medicine, and it was the appreciation of this fact which\r\nled the physicians of England to bestow upon him, after his death, the\r\nappellation of “The English Hippocrates,” and which ultimately gave him\r\nso highly honorable a position in the history of medicine in general. A\r\nbrief review of the state of medicine in England during the seventeenth\r\ncentury will enable the reader to understand the full importance of the\r\nchange which Sydenham was instrumental in bringing about.\r\n\r\nThe physicians of that period were split up into three sects: the\r\nfollowers of Galen, with whom should be classed the Graeco-Arabists;\r\nthe iatrochemists; and the iatrophysicists.\r\n\r\nThe Galenists were largely intent upon the strictest interpretation of\r\nthe teachings of Hippocrates, Galen and some of the Arabian authors.\r\nInstead of studying disease itself they devoted their time and thoughts\r\nlargely to the interpretation of the words used by these fathers in\r\nmedicine--_i.e._, to philology. Real progress in the science\r\nof medicine was not possible along this route. Accepting without\r\ndispute the dogma of the four humoral qualities, together with the\r\ndifferent temperaments which result from the predominance of any one\r\nof them, they combated these different temperaments or constitutions\r\nby prescribing drugs in a very great variety of combinations\r\n(polypharmacy).\r\n\r\nThe iatrochemists, attaching small importance to simple dietetic\r\nmeasures, prescribed without stint all the most active substances\r\nbelonging to the mineral kingdom and all the new remedies which the\r\nchemists had evolved from their furnaces.\r\n\r\nFinally, the iatrophysicists directed their efforts to the removal or\r\ndiminution of all bodily conditions that appeared to act as mechanical\r\nhindrances to health.\r\n\r\nSydenham, who possessed a rare degree of common sense, cast aside\r\nall these hypotheses, disregarded the prevailing routine methods of\r\ntreatment, and refused to accept the therapeutic novelties of the day.\r\n“Nature is to be my guide,” he declared, and from that time forward he\r\nstudied disease at the bedside, and watched carefully, and with a mind\r\nfree from prejudice, the effects of the remedies which he employed.\r\nThus, pursuing the methods advocated by the great master Hippocrates,\r\nhe was able to place his medical brethren once more on the pathway\r\nwhich leads to an increase in knowledge of the healing art. Practical\r\nmedicine, which had previously been falling into an almost moribund\r\ncondition, was by his efforts made again a living and growing science.\r\nThat Sydenham had a perfectly clear conception of what was needed at\r\nthat time to renew the vitality of the medical profession of England\r\nis plainly shown by the following statement which he makes in the\r\ndedication of one of his writings to Dr. Mapletoft:--[78]\r\n\r\n   After studying medicine for a few years at the University of\r\n   Oxford, I returned to London and entered upon the practice of\r\n   my profession. As I devoted myself with all possible zeal to\r\n   the work in hand it was not long before I realized thoroughly\r\n   that the best way of increasing one’s knowledge of medicine is\r\n   to begin applying, in actual practice, such principles as one\r\n   may already have acquired; and thus I became convinced that\r\n   the physician who earnestly studies, with his own eyes,--and\r\n   not through the medium of books,--the natural phenomena of\r\n   the different diseases, must necessarily excel in the art of\r\n   discovering what, in any given case, are the true indications as\r\n   to the remedial measures that should be employed. This was the\r\n   method in which I placed my entire faith, being fully persuaded\r\n   that if I took Nature for my guide, I should never stray far\r\n   from the right road, even if from time to time I might find\r\n   myself traversing ground that was wholly new to me.\r\n\r\nIn the brief account which I have thus far given of the part played by\r\nSydenham in advancing the science of medicine, I have called attention\r\nonly to the general character of the services which he rendered. It\r\nmay now be interesting to furnish here a few details that will aid\r\nin completing the picture of this great English physician,--details\r\nrelating to his life and personal character, to his views regarding\r\ncertain diseases and the remedies which he was in the habit of\r\nemploying for their relief or cure, and to his later writings.\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of his professional career Sydenham was\r\na frequent sufferer from gout, some of the attacks being of a severe\r\ntype and occasionally of long duration. During the winter of 1676, for\r\nexample, he was seriously ill from renal calculus, haematuria being\r\nbrought on by the slightest movements of his body. All through the year\r\n1677 he continued to experience frequent attacks of pain, and on one\r\noccasion he was unable to leave the house for a period of three months.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the epidemic of the Plague in 1665, during the progress of\r\nwhich he left London, Sydenham says: “When I saw that the danger was\r\nin my immediate neighborhood I listened to the advice of my friends\r\nand joined the crowd of those who were fleeing to the country. A\r\nlittle later, when the epidemic had further increased in severity,\r\nand before any of my neighbors had returned, I yielded to the calls\r\nof those who had need of my services, and went back to London.” It is\r\nworthy of remark, says Laboulbène, who fully appreciated the heroism\r\nwhich prompted this last decision, that we should never have known\r\nof Sydenham’s weakness in regard to facing his duty, if he himself\r\nhad not stated the facts. This famous epidemic, as is well known, was\r\naccompanied by an appalling mortality.\r\n\r\nAndrew Browne, a Scotch physician of good standing, entertained serious\r\nobjections to some of the advice given by Sydenham in the treatise\r\nentitled “_Schedula monitoria de novae febris ingressu_,”[79]\r\nand, in order to learn more precisely what the author’s views on the\r\nsubject really were, he decided to run down to London for a day or two.\r\nSydenham gave him such a cordial reception and made his stay in the\r\nmetropolis so pleasant that he remained there several months--instead\r\nof a day or two. “And when I returned to Scotland I felt contented and\r\njoyful as if I were carrying back with me a valuable treasure.”\r\n\r\nAs an instance of his thoughtful kindness, it is related that Sydenham\r\nhad occasion to treat a poor man who lived in his neighborhood for an\r\nobstinate bilious colic, but his employment of narcotics did not effect\r\nvery much in the way of relief. “I felt moved by pity for this poor\r\nman in his misery; and accordingly I loaned one of my horses to him in\r\norder that he might take long excursions on horseback.”\r\n\r\nSydenham had no eagerness for professional honors, although he\r\nappreciated highly those which came to him spontaneously. As already\r\nstated at the beginning of this sketch, the degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine was not conferred upon him by Cambridge as a mere honorary\r\naffair, but was won by him after he had passed through the regular\r\ncourse of training required of all candidates for this degree. His\r\ncase, however, was peculiar in one respect: he waited until after he\r\nhad been in active practice several years before he decided to pass\r\nthrough the course of training required. He was not a member of the\r\nCollege of Physicians of London, and he held no official position at\r\nCourt.\r\n\r\nThe following summary may serve to convey some idea of Sydenham’s views\r\nregarding pathology and treatment. He defines an acute disease as “a\r\nhelpful effort made by Nature to drive out of the body or system, in\r\nevery way possible, the morbific material.” As regards the latter he\r\nmakes the following remarks:--\r\n\r\n   Certain diseases are caused by particles which are disseminated\r\n   throughout the atmosphere, which possess qualities that are\r\n   antagonistic to the humors of the body, and which--when once\r\n   they gain an entrance into the system--become mingled with the\r\n   blood and thus are distributed throughout the entire organism.\r\n   Certain other diseases owe their origin to fermentations or\r\n   putrefactions of the humors, which fermentations vary in their\r\n   nature--in some cases the humors being excessive in quantity,\r\n   while in others they are bad in quality; and in either event the\r\n   body finds itself incapable of first assimilating them and then\r\n   excreting them--a state of affairs which cannot continue beyond\r\n   a certain length of time without producing further harmful\r\n   effects.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sydenham the fever, in the acute diseases, assists\r\nNature by separating from the general (total) mass of the blood those\r\nparticles which have undergone putrefaction or have been rendered\r\nunassimilable. Then they are driven out of the body by the route of the\r\nsweat-glands, by diarrhoea, by eruptions upon the skin, etc. On the\r\nother hand, in chronic diseases the morbific material is not of such a\r\nnature as to produce fever, which is a mechanism for securing complete\r\npurification. It is therefore deposited in one part or another of the\r\nbody where no force exists which is capable of ejecting it; or its\r\nfinal transformation is not completed until after the lapse of a long\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\nIn some of Sydenham’s writings one is occasionally surprised to find\r\nteachings which seem to be strongly at variance with the advice which\r\nhe was so fond of giving--namely, that physicians should be careful\r\nnot to set up hypotheses which are not based upon observed facts. A\r\nconspicuous instance of such a disregard of his own rule may be found\r\nin his setting up of a pathological process to which he gives the name\r\nof “inflammation of the blood.” This process, he maintains, is the\r\nactive cause of quite a large number of diseases, especially those\r\nof an epidemic nature--such, for example, as pleurisy, pneumonia,\r\nrheumatism, erysipelas, scarlet fever, etc. It is well-nigh impossible\r\nfor us moderns to comprehend how so practical and clear-headed a man as\r\nSydenham could have formulated such a purely hypothetical pathology, a\r\ndoctrine so completely lacking in anything like a solid foundation of\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nSydenham excelled in the description of the clinical manifestations of\r\ncertain diseases, as, for example, small-pox, hysterical affections,\r\nthe encystment of a renal calculus, and the gout--a disease from which,\r\nas already stated, he was a very frequent sufferer throughout a large\r\nportion of his life. All his published works are in the Latin language,\r\nbut translations have been made into English, French, German, Flemish\r\nand Italian. At All Souls College, Oxford, where Sydenham spent eight\r\nyears of his life, it was a fixed rule that all its members should\r\nhabitually converse and write in Latin.\r\n\r\nSydenham’s remarks upon liquid laudanum are worth recording:--\r\n\r\n   Of all the remedies which a kind Providence has bestowed upon\r\n   mankind for the purpose of lightening its miseries there is not\r\n   one which equals opium in its power to moderate the violence\r\n   of so many maladies and even to cure some of them.... Medicine\r\n   would be a one-arm man if it did not possess this remedy....\r\n   Laudanum is the best of all the cordials; indeed, it is the only\r\n   genuine cordial that we possess to-day. [This was written in the\r\n   middle of the seventeenth century.]\r\n\r\nThe laudanum employed by Sydenham was made according to the following\r\nformula: Spanish wine, 400 grammes; Opium, 62 grammes; Saffron, 31\r\ngrammes; Powder of Canella and Powder of Clove, of each 4 grammes.\r\n\r\nAfter much suffering and extreme weakness, Sydenham died on December\r\n31, 1689.\r\n\r\nAndrew Browne, the Scotch physician of whom mention has already been\r\nmade on an earlier page, makes the following comments on the closing\r\ndays of Sydenham’s career: “It is a difficult matter to believe,\r\nand yet it is the truth: This great physician, who throughout his\r\nlife gave the clearest proof of nobility of soul, generosity and\r\nclear-sightedness, died with the accusation hanging over his head that\r\nhe was ‘an impostor and an assassin of humanity.’” Laboulbène adds:\r\n“After years of self-sacrifice in behalf of his fellow men Sydenham\r\nreceived as his final earthly reward calumny and ignominy, and the\r\njealousy of many professional brethren.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n    THE THREE LEADING PHYSICIANS OF GERMANY DURING THE LATTER HALF\r\n    OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY: FRANZ DE LE BOË SYLVIUS, FRIEDRICH\r\n                    HOFFMANN AND GEORG ERNST STAHL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth century, says Berendes, was one of the saddest periods\r\nin the history of Germany; but, during the greater part of this time,\r\nthe neighboring countries--Holland, France, England and Italy--still\r\ncontinued to enjoy many of the blessings of the Renaissance,--such,\r\nfor example, as an uninterrupted activity of artistic efforts, of\r\nscientific work, and of commerce;--but in Germany everything seemed to\r\nbe in a state of confusion. A bloody religious war was at this period\r\ndevastating the land, and the best powers of the people were being\r\nwasted. Instead of increasing cultivation of manners and sentiments,\r\nthere was a steady growth of savagery. The Protestants, although they\r\nprobably were numerically superior, were split up into factions. The\r\nCatholics, on the other hand, were united, and their power steadily\r\nincreased. In 1618 the disturbances, which previously had been\r\nscattered in character, took on the form of what in time came to be\r\nknown as “The Thirty Years’ War,” a struggle which proved to be most\r\nsanguinary, costing Germany a great deal in every respect. Finally,\r\nthe war was brought to an end by the signing of the Westphalian Treaty\r\nof Peace at Lützen, in 1648. Some idea of the terribly destructive\r\nnature of this long war may be gathered from the fact that the\r\npopulation of Germany, which previously had been estimated at twenty\r\nmillions, was found to have been reduced to about six millions. Whole\r\ntowns and villages were laid in ashes, and as a consequence those\r\nwho had survived the disaster lost confidence in themselves and were\r\nnot able, at least for several years, to undertake anything in art,\r\nliterature or science; and this depressing atmosphere affected in some\r\ndegree the people of the Netherlands. Toward the end of the century,\r\nhowever, there came a marked awakening among the younger generation of\r\nphysicians, and in the course of twenty or thirty years four men, only\r\nthree of whom, however, were of German birth, succeeded in attaining\r\na decided leadership in this department of science. The names of the\r\nGermans are Franz de le Boë (commonly spoken of as Sylvius), Friedrich\r\nHoffmann and Georg Ernst Stahl. I shall now attempt to furnish, as\r\nnearly as possible in proper chronological order, very brief sketches\r\nof the lives of these distinguished physicians, together with an\r\naccount of the contributions which they made to the science of medicine.\r\n\r\n_Franz de le Boë (Sylvius)._--Franz de le Boë (Sylvius) was born\r\nat Hanau, Prussia, in 1614, of parents who belonged to the nobility\r\nand were wealthy, and who consequently were able to give their son\r\nevery opportunity for acquiring an excellent education. Thus Franz\r\nfirst received a thorough training in philosophy and the classics and\r\nafterward visited in turn all the leading universities of Holland,\r\nFrance and Germany before he finally took his degree of Doctor of\r\nMedicine at Basel, Switzerland, in 1637. From this time forward, for a\r\nperiod of twenty-three years, he devoted himself to the practice of his\r\nprofession, first in his native city and then in Leyden and Amsterdam.\r\nIn 1660 he accepted an invitation to occupy the Chair of Medicine\r\nin the University of Leyden, and this position he held during the\r\nremainder of his life. He died in 1672.\r\n\r\nAs a teacher Sylvius was very popular, Boerhaave alone, at a later\r\nperiod, finding greater favor among the crowds of medical students and\r\nphysicians who frequented this university. Haeser and Haller both\r\nattribute some portion of this popularity to the fact that Sylvius\r\ncombined genuine eloquence with a wonderful charm of manner and a\r\nprofound knowledge of chemistry, pharmacy and pathological anatomy.\r\nIn the practice of medicine he followed Van Helmont very closely,\r\nbut he was not willing to accept his teachings about an “_archaeus\r\ninsitus_” and an “_archaeus influus_.” The system which he\r\nadvocated was of a very simple character, and this fact undoubtedly\r\ncontributed much to his popularity among the students. His therapeutic\r\nmethods were also of a thoroughly practical nature.\r\n\r\nOf the works which Sylvius published the following deserve to receive\r\nspecial mention: “_Disputationes medicae_,” a book in which are\r\nset forth his views regarding the fundamental principles of the science\r\nof medicine--physiology in particular; “_De methodo medendi_,” a\r\ntreatise on therapeutics; and “_Praxeos medicae idea nova_,” a new\r\nidea concerning the practice of medicine.\r\n\r\nSylvius was one of the earliest defenders of Harvey’s great discovery,\r\nand he was also one of the first to call attention to the part played\r\nby chemistry in elucidating some of the problems in physiology and\r\npathology. At the same time he was always ready to acknowledge the\r\nimportance of the part played by mechanics in respiration, in the\r\ncirculation of the blood, in the movements of the intestines, etc., in\r\nwhich respects he was in entire agreement with the iatrophysicists or\r\niatromathematicians.[80]\r\n\r\nFinally, there is one more respect in which Sylvius is entitled to\r\ngreat credit: he paid most careful attention to the work of giving\r\nclinical instruction. Recognizing, as I do, the importance of this\r\nbranch of medicine, I shall not hesitate to devote here a page or two\r\nto a brief review of the manner in which it came to hold the honorable\r\nposition which it occupies to-day in all the best schemes for medical\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth century, as Puschmann assures us, an attempt was\r\nmade at Padua, Italy, to render clinical instruction an essential\r\npart of the physician’s education, but the difficulties which were\r\nencountered proved so much greater than was anticipated that it was\r\nsoon found necessary to abandon the plan; and then for many years no\r\nfurther effort was made, either at Padua or at any of the other Italian\r\nmedical schools, to introduce clinical teaching. After the lapse of\r\nnearly a century, Johannes Heurnius (1543–1601), Professor of Medicine\r\nat the University of Leyden, made an effort to introduce the plan of\r\nteaching medicine at the bedside; and a few years later (1630) two\r\nother professors of the same university--viz., Otho Heurnius, son of\r\nJohannes, and E. Schrevelius--formally introduced clinical instruction\r\nat the city hospital. The plan which they adopted was the following:\r\nThe students in turn were permitted first to question the patient about\r\nhis ailment and then afterward to make whatever physical examination\r\nappeared to be necessary; next, each one of them stated briefly what\r\nhe believed to be the nature of the malady, and also gave his views as\r\nto the prognosis, symptoms and treatment; after which the professor\r\ncommented on these different reports, pointing out both the correct and\r\nthe incorrect features in each case. After a short trial of the plan\r\nit became clear that it would have to be abandoned, for the students\r\ndid not like to have attention called in such a public manner to their\r\nmistakes. Then, a few years later, Sylvius, who at that time was the\r\nProfessor of Medicine, introduced a system of clinical teaching which\r\nis thus briefly described by his colleague, Lucas Schacht:--\r\n\r\n   When, followed by his pupils, he approached the bedside of a\r\n   patient, he assumed the air of one who is entirely ignorant\r\n   of the nature of that person’s malady, of the accompanying\r\n   symptoms, and of the treatment which was being carried out.\r\n   Then he began to ask first one and then another of the students\r\n   a great variety of questions respecting the case that was\r\n   under consideration,--questions which at first seemed to have\r\n   been propounded in a haphazard fashion, but which in reality\r\n   were so cleverly formulated as to elicit from the class all\r\n   the information needed for the making of a correct diagnosis,\r\n   while leaving on the minds of the students the impression that\r\n   they, and not the professor, had worked out the problem to a\r\n   successful result.\r\n\r\nThis system, if such it may be termed, proved extremely successful, and\r\nthe knowledge of this success spread rapidly from one end of Europe\r\nto the other, causing students and physicians to flock to Leyden from\r\nRussia, Poland, Hungary, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, France, Italy and\r\nEngland. So long as this particular university continued to possess, as\r\na member of its faculty, a professor of medicine who was clever enough\r\nto carry on clinical instruction with the same profound knowledge\r\nof human nature as had been displayed by Sylvius, just so long did\r\nthis institution remain without a rival in this part of the field of\r\nmedical education. Then Sylvius was followed, in the work of clinical\r\nteaching, by Boerhaave, a man admirably fitted, both by nature and by\r\nthe training which he had received, to keep the University of Leyden\r\nin the first rank of medical schools as regards this most useful\r\nform of discipline. After 1738, the year in which Boerhaave died,\r\nother universities besides that of Leyden began to provide fairly\r\nsatisfactory facilities for clinical study, and among the number of\r\nsuch institutions those of Utrecht, Rome, Edinburgh, Paris and Halle\r\ndeserve to be mentioned. The lack of funds and doubtless also the lack\r\nof the right sort of teachers were the principal reasons why these\r\nschools were not able to vie with Leyden in furnishing the facilities\r\nneeded for clinical instruction. That the fault--at least in the case\r\nof the University of Halle--was not to be attributed to a failure\r\non the part of the Medical Faculty to appreciate the value of such\r\ninstruction is clearly shown by the saying attributed to Friedrich\r\nHoffmann, who at that period was the Professor of Medicine:--\r\n\r\n   By a mere attendance upon medical lectures no man will ever\r\n   succeed in becoming a properly equipped practitioner of that\r\n   art; it is indispensable, in addition, that he should receive\r\n   clinical instruction.\r\n\r\nThe fairly permanent establishment of this fundamental branch of\r\nmedical teaching was not effected until about the middle of the\r\neighteenth century, when Van Swieten, one of Boerhaave’s most\r\ndistinguished pupils, was given full authority by the Empress Maria\r\nTheresa to furnish, at the University of Vienna, all the facilities\r\nrequired for successfully carrying on such instruction. From that\r\ntime onward, to a quite recent date, Vienna has been the Mecca of all\r\nthe younger physicians who aspired to become fully equipped in the\r\npractical branches of the science of medicine.\r\n\r\n_Georg Ernst Stahl._--Georg Ernst Stahl was born at Anspach,\r\nGermany, in 1660. Little is known about his early life beyond the\r\nfact that he pursued his studies at the University of Jena, received\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Medicine from that institution in 1684, and\r\nshortly afterward began giving private courses in medicine which proved\r\nto be very popular and soon brought him into public notice. In 1687\r\nhe was given the position of Court Physician at Weimar. In 1694, upon\r\nthe recommendation of Friedrich Hoffmann, who was at that time the\r\nincumbent of the regular Chair, he was appointed Associate Professor of\r\nMedicine in the recently founded University of Halle, Prussian Saxony;\r\nthe understanding being that he was to devote his attention more\r\nparticularly to the physiological, pathological, chemical and botanical\r\naspects of the subject. He held this position up to the year 1716, when\r\nhe was appointed one of the attending physicians of Frederick William\r\nthe First, King of Prussia, and thereafter was obliged to reside in\r\nBerlin, in which city he died in 1734.\r\n\r\nStahl was a tireless worker, and wrote a large number of treatises\r\n(two hundred and forty-four in all) on physiological and pathological\r\ntopics--all of them in Latin. Albert Lemoine, who has written an\r\nelaborate monograph on one of these treatises (that relating to\r\nanimism), says that, despite the obscure style in which this and most\r\nof his other treatises are written, one may, upon careful study,\r\nsatisfy himself that Stahl is a very close reasoner and possesses a\r\nclear mind. His most conspicuous faults, Lemoine adds, are these: he\r\nis opinionated and vain, and objects strongly to any criticisms that\r\nhis opponents make; and yet he is careful to take up these criticisms\r\none by one and subject them to a close analysis. His vanity led him to\r\nmaintain that he was the only person then living who was capable of\r\nlifting medicine out of the rut in which it was at that time rigidly\r\nheld. He manifested a sovereign contempt, not only for the men whose\r\nopinions differed from his, but also for those who complained of the\r\ndifficulty of comprehending the Latin in which his treatises are\r\nwritten. Finally, Lemoine states that Stahl is addicted to mysticism,\r\nas is shown by the invocations of all sorts with which he begins and\r\nends most of his writings. Haeser adds that Stahl possessed a gloomy,\r\nreticent and overbearing spirit, in striking contrast with the charming\r\nsweetness of temper of his colleague Hoffmann.\r\n\r\nAmong Stahl’s numerous contributions to medical literature there\r\nis only one in which our readers are likely to take any particular\r\ninterest; I refer to the treatise which bears the title “_Theoria\r\nmedica vera_”--the true theory upon which the science of medicine\r\nis based. It is in this work more particularly that Stahl expounds\r\nthe doctrine of animism. As I have tried in vain to obtain a really\r\nsatisfactory conception of this doctrine, which occupied so great a\r\nplace in the thoughts of the physicians of the period between 1650 and\r\n1750, I have decided to rest satisfied with merely reproducing here\r\nthe interpretation which William Cullen of Edinburgh, one of Stahl’s\r\ncontemporaries and also one of the greatest English physicians of\r\nthat period, gives in his celebrated “First Lines of the Practice of\r\nPhysic”:--\r\n\r\n   What is frequently spoken of as the power of nature--the “_vis\r\n   conservatrix et medicatrix naturae_”--resides entirely in\r\n   the rational soul. Stahl supposes that upon many occasions the\r\n   soul acts independently of the body, and that, without any\r\n   physical necessity arising from that state, the soul, purely\r\n   in consequence of its intelligence, perceiving the tendency of\r\n   noxious powers threatening, or of disorders any ways arising in\r\n   the system, immediately excites such motions in the body as are\r\n   suited to obviate the hurtful or pernicious consequences which\r\n   might otherwise take place.\r\n\r\nBarthélemy St. Hilaire of Paris (1805–1895) in one of his writings\r\nsays: “I am convinced that the central idea in Stahl’s physiology was\r\nsuggested to him by the reading of Aristotle’s ‘_De anima_,’ in\r\nwhich this great philosopher states that the soul nourishes the body,\r\nand also that nutrition is one of the four ways in which the soul\r\nmanifests itself.”\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the effect of Stahl’s doctrines upon the actual practice\r\nof medicine as a whole, Cullen says that it was of a controlling\r\ncharacter, leading physicians to propose the “art of curing by\r\nexpectation”; the natural result of which was that they advocated for\r\nthe most part the employment of only very inert and frivolous remedies.\r\nOn the other hand, they zealously opposed the use of some of the most\r\nefficacious drugs, such as opium and the Peruvian bark, and resorted\r\nto bleeding and to the administration of emetics only in exceptional\r\ncases. Cullen adds that:--\r\n\r\n   The Stahlian system has often had a very baneful influence on\r\n   the practice of physic, as either leading physicians into, or\r\n   continuing them in, a weak and feeble practice, and at the same\r\n   time superseding or discouraging all the attempts of art....\r\n   The opposition to chemical medicines in the sixteenth and\r\n   seventeenth centuries, and the noted condemnation of antimony by\r\n   the Medical Faculty of Paris, are to be attributed chiefly to\r\n   those prejudices which the physicians of France did not entirely\r\n   get the better of for near a hundred years after. We may take\r\n   notice of the reserve it produced in Boerhaave with respect to\r\n   the use of the Peruvian bark.\r\n\r\nStahl, after taking up his residence in Berlin, devoted himself\r\nenergetically to the increase and spread of the knowledge of chemistry.\r\nThe thing which brought him the greatest celebrity, both in his own\r\nlifetime and also during the years following his death, was his\r\npropounding of the “phlogiston” theory. This theory was to the effect\r\nthat all combustible materials or substances contain (as he assumed)\r\nan element to which he gave the name of _phlogiston_. He was not\r\nable, however, to demonstrate the actual existence of this element;\r\nhe simply assumed that it existed. At the same time the fact should\r\nhere be stated that the terms “oxidation” and “reduction,” which came\r\ninto use during the following century, developed out of this theory of\r\nphlogiston.\r\n\r\n_Friedrich Hoffmann._--Friedrich Hoffmann was born at Halle,\r\nPrussian Saxony, February 19, 1660, and received his medical education\r\nin his native city, largely under the direction of his father, who was\r\nhimself a physician. In 1678 he attended lectures at the University\r\nof Jena, and in the following year visited Erfurt in order to\r\nbenefit from the instruction of Caspar Cramer, who was at that time\r\na distinguished authority in chemistry. At the end of two years he\r\nreturned to Jena, took his degree of Doctor of Medicine, and acquired\r\nthe right to deliver public lectures. Then, during the following three\r\nyears, he visited Holland and England, and, upon his return in 1685,\r\nsettled at Minden, Westphalia, as a general practitioner of medicine.\r\nIn 1686 he was appointed District Physician of the Principality of\r\nMinden and also Court Physician of the Prince Elector; and two years\r\nlater he accepted the position of District Physician at Halberstadt.\r\nAfter the inauguration of the new university at Halle, July 12, 1694,\r\nHoffmann appears as one of the earliest professors chosen to serve the\r\ninstitution. In 1701, when Frederick the Third, Electoral Prince of\r\nPrussia, assumed the crown under the title of Frederick the First, King\r\nof Prussia, he extended to Hoffmann an invitation to come to Berlin and\r\naccept the position of Private Physician to His Majesty. Hoffmann was\r\nnot at first willing to accept the invitation, but in 1708, when the\r\nKing, who had then become seriously ill, renewed his request, Hoffmann\r\naccepted, on condition that he might retain his professorship. In 1712\r\nhe returned to Halle and remained there until he died in 1742.\r\n\r\nBefore Hoffmann’s time very little was known concerning the nature of\r\ncarbonous (or carbonic) oxide and concerning the fatal effects which\r\nmay be produced by inhalation of this gas. It was a common belief,\r\nfor example, that the gas was given off by freshly plastered walls;\r\nand--as an even worse error--the theological authorities showed an\r\ninclination, in many of the fatal instances which probably were due\r\nto inhalation of carbonous oxide, but in which no recognizable cause\r\nof death had been discovered, to explain the event as due to the\r\nmalign interference of the Devil. In our time it is well understood\r\nin the community that the fumes of carbonous oxide constitute the\r\nmost dangerous gas that one is liable to encounter, but in Hoffmann’s\r\nday the people appear to have been less well informed concerning this\r\ndanger than they were in ancient times. In the treatise on this subject\r\nwhich Hoffmann published in 1716,[81] several of the earliest known\r\ninstances of such poisoning are narrated, the first one being that\r\nmentioned very briefly by Aristotle (384–322 B. C.). Then follow two\r\nvery short references to this subject in the “_De rerum natura_”\r\nof the Roman poet Titus Lucretius Carus (95–52 B. C.). They read as\r\nfollows: (1) “The fumes of burning charcoal easily affect the brain if\r\nthou hast not first taken a drink of water.” (Book VI., verse 803.) (1)\r\n“If the fumes of the night lamp,[82] after it has been extinguished,\r\nare inhaled rather deeply the effect experienced will be the same as if\r\none had been struck down by a blow on the head.” (Book VI., verse 792.)\r\nThe idea that the previous drinking of water is competent to prevent\r\nthe effects of poisoning by charcoal fumes is declared by Neuburger,\r\nthe translator of Hoffmann’s treatise, to be erroneous.\r\n\r\nThe earliest really satisfactory description of an instance of\r\nnon-fatal poisoning by the fumes of burning charcoal is credited by\r\nHoffmann to the Roman Emperor, Julian the Apostate, who reigned from\r\n361 A. D. to 363 A. D. Before he was made Emperor, Julian was intrusted\r\nby Constantius II., in 355 A. D., with the government of the Province\r\nof Gaul, and in 357 he won a great battle against the Alamanni at\r\nStrassburg; after which he took up his residence in the little city of\r\nLutetia, the present Paris. It was undoubtedly soon after this event\r\nthat he wrote the Greek satire which bears the title “Misopogon,” and\r\nfrom which Hoffmann quotes the following account of Julian’s narrow\r\nescape from death through the poisonous effects of carbonous oxide:--\r\n\r\n   The little city which the Celts call Lutetia is built upon a\r\n   small island in the midst of a river, and access to it from\r\n   both sides is gained by means of wooden bridges. Ordinarily the\r\n   winter climate in this region is mild, owing--as the people\r\n   of the place claim--to the proximity of the Ocean. Good wine\r\n   is produced there, and even fig-trees flourish provided care\r\n   be taken to wrap them well in wheat straw or some similar\r\n   protective material during the winter season. But my visit\r\n   happened to have been made during an exceptionally severe\r\n   winter, and as a result things which looked like slabs of\r\n   Phrygian marble, closely packed together, were constantly\r\n   floating down the river with the current, and, soon becoming\r\n   jammed, they formed a sort of natural bridge. Although most of\r\n   the houses--the one I occupied among the number--were provided\r\n   with fireplaces and chimney-flues, and might therefore readily\r\n   be heated, I was not willing that a fire should be kindled in my\r\n   bedroom. I was very little sensitive to cold, and, in addition,\r\n   I was desirous of becoming more and more hardened to its\r\n   influence.... As the severity of the weather, however, showed no\r\n   signs of letting up, I permitted the attendants to bring into\r\n   the room a few glowing coals, just enough to render the air of\r\n   the chamber less chilly. But, notwithstanding the very small\r\n   degree of heat which these few burning coals supplied, it proved\r\n   to be sufficient to draw out from the damp walls exhalations\r\n   that caused my head to feel as if it were tightly held in a\r\n   vice and also produced a sensation as if I were choking. I was\r\n   immediately removed from the room, and the physicians who were\r\n   promptly summoned administered an emetic which enabled me to\r\n   get rid of the food which I had eaten a short time before. Soon\r\n   afterward I had a refreshing sleep and was able on the following\r\n   day to resume my work as usual. [Translated from the German\r\n   version printed in Neuburger’s monograph.]\r\n\r\nAs will be seen from the reports which I have just quoted, there\r\nexisted among the Germans, early in the eighteenth century, no fixed\r\nbelief as to the real cause of death in many of these unexplained fatal\r\ncases; and it was therefore no small public service which Hoffmann\r\nrendered when he, in whose judgment about such matters the people at\r\nlarge placed the greatest confidence, published such a clear and simple\r\nexplanation of the real cause of these deaths as that which is given in\r\nthis interesting monograph.\r\n\r\nHoffmann also added not a little to his fame by the invention of\r\na remedy which was first known as “Hoffmann’s drops,” but which\r\nto-day appears in the United States Pharmacopoeia under the name\r\nof “Hoffmann’s anodyne” or “_spiritus aetheris compositus_”\r\n(sulphuric ether, 325; alcohol, 650; ethereal oil, 25).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n         HERMANN BOERHAAVE OF LEYDEN, HOLLAND, ONE OF THE MOST\r\n          DISTINGUISHED PHYSICIANS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nHermann Boerhaave, who was born at Voorhont, near Leyden, Holland, on\r\nDecember 31, 1668, was the son of a poor but highly educated clergyman;\r\nand it was owing to this circumstance that he received in early youth\r\na most careful training in Latin and Greek and in belles-lettres. At\r\nthe age of fourteen he entered the public school of Leyden, and made\r\nsuch rapid progress in his studies--history, mathematics, the different\r\nbranches of natural philosophy, Hebrew and Chaldean languages, and\r\nmetaphysics--that he was soon able to follow regularly the lectures\r\ngiven at the university. He was only fifteen at the time when his\r\nfather died, leaving him absolutely penniless; but Van Alphen, the\r\nBurgomaster of Leyden, befriended him and furnished all the funds\r\nneeded for a continuance of his studies at the university. But young\r\nBoerhaave, who was not willing to be entirely dependent on the aid thus\r\nprovided, contributed to his own support not a little by giving private\r\ninstruction to young students of the wealthy class. In 1690 he received\r\nthe degree of Doctor of Philosophy, the subject of his dissertation\r\nbeing a refutal of the doctrines of Epicurus, Hobbes and Spinosa.\r\nHis original intention had been to prepare himself for the ministry,\r\nbut, after continuing his studies in theology for a short time, he\r\ndetermined that the better course for him would be to choose the career\r\nof physician. Accordingly he began, at the age of twenty-two, to study\r\nthe anatomical treatises of Vesalius, Fallopius and Bartholinus, and at\r\nthe same time he followed a course of instruction in dissecting, under\r\nthe guidance of the anatomist Nuck, and also occasionally attended the\r\nlectures given by Drelincourt, who at that time was Professor of the\r\nTheory of Medicine. In his reading of medical literature he showed a\r\ndecided preference for the writings of Hippocrates and Sydenham; and\r\nhe devoted a large portion of his time to the study of botany and\r\nchemistry, two branches of the science of medicine in which he took a\r\nvery strong interest all through life. In 1693 he received the degree\r\nof Doctor of Medicine from the University of Harderwyk.[83] In 1701\r\nhe was appointed Associate Professor of the Theory of Medicine in\r\nthe University of Leyden, and it was in this capacity that he began\r\nbuilding up that great reputation which in a very few years brought\r\ncrowds of students from all parts of the world to Leyden. As already\r\nstated on a previous page, he owed a large part of his fame to the\r\nadmirable manner in which he conducted his clinical teaching. To show\r\nhow widely he was known throughout Europe the story is told that a\r\nletter which had been sent to him from a mandarin living in China and\r\nwhich bore the address, “To the illustrious Boerhaave, Physician in\r\nEurope,” reached him in due course.\r\n\r\nSoon after his first appointment at Leyden, he received other most\r\nflattering offers, such as that of William the Third, Hereditary Prince\r\nof the Netherlands, to accept the position of Court Physician at The\r\nHague, and a call from the University of Groningen (1703) to occupy\r\nthe Chair of Medicine. He declined these offers as he preferred to\r\nremain at Leyden; but, a few years later, in 1709, he accepted the\r\nfull professorship of the Practice of Medicine in the institution\r\nwith which he was already connected. From the vantage ground of this\r\nmore responsible position he was able most successfully to teach the\r\nstudents the best methods of observing, identifying and treating the\r\ndifferent diseases; and as a further result of this promotion in rank\r\nhis private practice grew rapidly, monarchs and princes coming from\r\nevery country in Europe to consult him about their maladies. Boerhaave\r\nwas also most popular among his fellow townsmen. It is related of\r\nhim, for example, that on one occasion, after he had been confined to\r\nthe house for about six months by an illness of a gouty nature, the\r\ncitizens of Leyden manifested their joy at his recovery by inaugurating\r\na general illumination of the town during the evening of the day on\r\nwhich he made his first appearance on the street. He had two relapses\r\nof the gouty affection, one in 1727 and another in 1729, and he finally\r\ndied from disease of the heart on September 23, 1738. The monument\r\nraised in his honor by the city of Leyden bears the inscription:\r\n“_Salutifero Boerhaavii genio sacrum_” (Sacred to the memory of\r\nthe health-giving genius of Boerhaave).\r\n\r\nSome idea of the lucrative character of Boerhaave’s private practice\r\nmay be gained from the fact that he left to his only child, a daughter,\r\nthe sum of about four million francs. And yet he was noted for the\r\ngenerous gifts which he made during his lifetime to all sorts of\r\nscientific and benevolent objects.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave, says Dezeimeris, exercised during his career, and also for a\r\nlong time after his death, an immense influence upon medical thought.\r\nHe is justly ranked, he adds, among the iatromathematicians, and it\r\nis correct to say that he was largely instrumental in overthrowing\r\nthe chemical system which de le Boë (Sylvius) had developed. His own\r\ntreatise on this branch of knowledge (“Elementa Chemiae”), which was\r\npublished toward the end of his life, soon became the standard work\r\non this subject, and it retained its popularity for many years. “It\r\nis to be regretted that, possessing as Boerhaave unquestionably did,\r\nremarkable powers of observation, he should have allowed himself, in\r\nopposition to the very principles which he advocated so strongly,\r\nto indulge in the making of systems and hypotheses. He commenced by\r\nadvocating with enthusiasm the method of Hippocrates, and ended by\r\nfollowing the brilliant but not very trustworthy example of Galen.”\r\n(Dezeimeris.)\r\n\r\nThe number of treatises which Boerhaave published is quite large,\r\nthe most important among them being the following: “_Oratio de\r\ncommendando studio Hippocratico_,” 1701; “_Institutiones medicae\r\nin usus annuae exercitationis domesticos_,” 1708; “_Aphorismi\r\nde cognoscendis et curandis morbis in usum doctrinae medicae_,”\r\n1709 (English version printed in London in 1742); and “_Elementa\r\nchemiae_,” 1732 (English translation by Peter Shaw, London, 1741).\r\n\r\nOf the “Aphorisms,” one of the most widely known of Boerhaave’s\r\npublished treatises, I shall take the liberty of saying a few words.\r\nThis work is in reality a very concise statement of the author’s views\r\nregarding pathology, pathological anatomy and therapeutics, and I\r\nbelieve that the following paragraphs, although few in number, will\r\nsuffice to give our readers a fair idea of the general character of the\r\nbook. At the same time I must confess that I have not found it an easy\r\nmatter to understand and satisfactorily digest many of the individual\r\naphorisms, the text of which has been compressed into such a small\r\nspace. It therefore does seem surprising to learn from one critic that,\r\nif one wishes to ascertain what Boerhaave’s views are with regard to\r\nthe science of medicine, one should read by preference the Commentaries\r\nof Van Swieten, who was Boerhaave’s favorite pupil and assistant.\r\n\r\nThe following four or five aphorisms are typical specimens belonging to\r\nthe earlier sections of the book:--[84]\r\n\r\n   (7.) A disease when present in a body, must needs be the bodily\r\n   effect of a particular cause directed to that body.\r\n\r\n   (8.) Which effect being entirely removed, health is recovered.\r\n\r\n   (9.) It may be removed by correcting the illness itself in\r\n   particular, _viz._, by the applications of medicines\r\n   to the particular diseased part, or by some remedies which\r\n   operate equally upon the whole: the first we’ll call a\r\n   _particular_, the latter a _general_ cure.\r\n\r\n   (10.) The way to both is discovered either _by\r\n   observation_, or _by comparing_ one case with another,\r\n   or _by a true reasoning_ from them both.\r\n\r\n   (13.) He who doth, with the greatest exactness imaginable, weigh\r\n   every individual thing that shall happen or hath happened to\r\n   his patient and may be known from the observations of his own\r\n   or of others, and who afterward compareth all these with one\r\n   another, and puts them in an opposite view to such things as\r\n   happen in an healthy state; and lastly, from all this, with the\r\n   nicest and severest bridle upon his reasoning faculty, riseth\r\n   to the knowledge of the very first cause of the disease, and of\r\n   the remedies fit to remove them; _he_, and _only he_,\r\n   deserveth the name of _a true physician_.\r\n\r\nThen Boerhaave proceeds to make a classification of diseases, and among\r\nthe very first groups which one finds in this classified list are the\r\nfollowing: “Distempers of a lax and weak fibre”; “Distempers of the\r\nstiff and elastic fibre”; “Distempers of the less and larger vessels”;\r\n“Distempers of weak and lax entrails”; “Distempers of the too strong\r\nand stiff entrails”; etc.--from which it is apparent that the old\r\ndoctrine of the _strictum_ and the _laxum_, which was taught\r\nby the Methodists in the early centuries of our era, has here been\r\nadopted by Boerhaave in all its essential characters; and also that the\r\ntreatment which he recommends for some of these classes of maladies\r\ndoes not materially differ from that advocated by this ancient school\r\nof medicine. The following extracts, I believe, will suffice to give\r\nthe reader a fairly clear understanding of what Boerhaave means by the\r\nexpressions “distempers of the solid simple fibre,” “distempers of a\r\nlax and weak fibre,” and “distempers of the stiff and elastic fibre,”\r\nand will at the same time show what methods he employed for overcoming\r\nthese distempers. At the time when Boerhaave made use of the term\r\n“fibre” (_fibra_) in the very uncertain sense in which he here\r\nemploys it, Leeuwenhoek and Malpighi were demonstrating, by aid of the\r\nnewly perfected microscope, that the so-called simple tissues were in\r\nreality quite complex structures; and one’s first impulse, therefore,\r\nis to express surprise that a physician of such high standing as our\r\nauthor should have used the term. But we moderns must not forget that,\r\nin those early days, it took decades for knowledge of this nature\r\nto spread even a very short distance, as from Delft to Leyden, and\r\nthen to exert its legitimate influence upon medical thought--that\r\nis, to be digested and afterward permanently appropriated. There can\r\nbe scarcely any doubt that, at the time (1709) when Boerhaave wrote\r\nthese aphorisms, he had already heard about the existence and the\r\ncapabilities of the recently perfected microscope, but it is not at all\r\nlikely that he had as yet digested the gains in anatomical knowledge\r\nwhich had been acquired through the assistance of this instrument. The\r\nextracts referred to above are the following:--\r\n\r\n                 DISTEMPERS OF THE SOLID SIMPLE FIBRE\r\n\r\n   (21) Those parts (which, being separated from the fluid\r\n   contained in the vessels, are applied and sticking to each other\r\n   by the strength of the living body, and make the least fibre)\r\n   are the least, the simplest, earthy, and hardly changeable from\r\n   or by virtue of any cause, which are found in our living bodies.\r\n\r\n                  DISTEMPERS OF A LAX AND WEAK FIBRE\r\n\r\n   (24) The weakness of the fibre is that cohesion of the minutest\r\n   parts described (21), which is so loosely linked that it may be\r\n   pulled asunder even by that degree of motion which is requisite\r\n   in healthy bodies, or not much exceeding it.\r\n\r\n   (26) The weakness produceth easily a stretching and a breaking\r\n   of the small vessels made up of those weak fibres (24), and\r\n   consequently abates of their power over the fluids therein\r\n   contained; from which distensions arise tumors, from the\r\n   stagnating or extravasated liquids putrefactions, and, farther,\r\n   all such innumerable ills as are the consequences of them both.\r\n\r\n   (28) [In distempers of a lax and weak fibre] the cure must\r\n   be obtained, 1. By aliments that abound in such matter as\r\n   is described in section 21, and which [should] be almost so\r\n   prepared beforehand as they are in a strong and healthy body;\r\n   such are milk, eggs, flesh-broths, panadoes[85] rightly prepared\r\n   of well-fermented bread; and rough wines. All which must be\r\n   given in small quantities, but often. 2. By increasing and\r\n   invigorating the motion of the solids and fluids by means of\r\n   frictions with a flesh-brush, or with flannel; by riding on\r\n   horseback, and in a coach, or by being carried in a boat; and\r\n   lastly by walking, running and other bodily exercises. 3.

I should be glad to reproduce here such portions\r\nof the aphorisms as would corroborate the statement that I have just\r\nmade, but unfortunately the small amount of space that I can command\r\ndoes not permit me to do this. At every step, as I advance, I am warned\r\nagainst the danger of exceeding the limits permitted, and I shall,\r\ntherefore, in the present instance, have to rest satisfied with quoting\r\nthe larger part of a single paragraph in which is given an account of\r\nthe treatment employed in a case of acute pleurisy.\r\n\r\n   (890) ... If the same pleurisy be recent before the end of the\r\n   third day, yet violent from the many and strong symptoms, and\r\n   dry, in a strong, exercised, dry body, without the hopes of\r\n   the presence of (887 and 888) [a resolution or a concoction\r\n   and excretion of the cause], then let the patient immediately\r\n   be blooded largely, with a quick running stream out of a\r\n   great vessel, and a large orifice, keeping his body quiet and\r\n   leaning backwards, enforcing his breathing all the while with\r\n   coughing or panting, fomenting the side at the same time, and\r\n   gently rubbing it; which bleeding ought to be continued till the\r\n   pain seems to abate pretty considerably, unless a fainting fit\r\n   forces you to leave off sooner; at whose approach the vein must\r\n   immediately be stopped. Bleeding ought to be repeated according\r\n   as these symptoms do return upon whose account it was done the\r\n   first time; and when that skin doth not any longer appear upon\r\n   the surface of the blood, it is time to forbear more bleeding.\r\n\r\n   From the beginning ought to be used fomentations, bathings, warm\r\n   streams, liniments, plaisters, and the like; which may be of use\r\n   as they loosen, resolve, mitigate, and avert....\r\n\r\nAs only extracts of considerable length would suffice to give our\r\nreaders a satisfactory idea of the attractive manner in which Boerhaave\r\ndeals with the subject of chemistry, I prefer to omit them altogether,\r\nand to recommend to those who are specially interested in this\r\nbranch of science, that they consult Peter Shaw’s excellent English\r\ntranslation of the “_Elementa Chemiae_.”\r\n\r\nAlbert von Haller, the celebrated Swiss physiologist and historian of\r\nmedical literature, speaks of Boerhaave as “my beloved preceptor, a man\r\nof refined taste and a speaker or lecturer so logical and charming that\r\none more gifted can hardly be imagined.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n    GENERAL REMARKS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURGERY IN EUROPE DURING\r\n                 THE FIFTEENTH AND SIXTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the early period of the Renaissance surgery was apparently the\r\nfirst of the practical branches of medicine to spring forward into\r\nactive life. Anatomy,--that is, human anatomy,--the foundation that is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the solid growth of surgery, scarcely existed\r\nbefore the beginning of the sixteenth century; and it is therefore\r\nnot surprising that the records of the past reveal to us so very few\r\ninstances of men who attained any eminence as surgeons. When this\r\nfact is taken into consideration I cannot help feeling that, in the\r\nsketches which I drew, on earlier pages, of Theodoric of Cervia,\r\nWilliam of Saliceto, Lanfranchi of Milan (and later of France), Henri\r\nde Mondeville and Guy de Chauliac, I gave to these men only a small\r\nfraction of the credit to which they were justly entitled. Indeed,\r\nthe excellence of the work done by them and recorded in the treatises\r\nwhich they published, is so great as to arouse the suspicion that they\r\nhad clandestinely acquired more knowledge of human anatomy than they\r\ndared to admit. The life of a dissector of human bodies, it should be\r\nremembered, was by no means safe in those days.\r\n\r\nBut the lack of a trustworthy knowledge of anatomy was not the only\r\nhindrance to a healthy development of the art of surgery. There were\r\nother obstacles which, up to a comparatively late period in the\r\nsixteenth century, continued to block the advance of this art. Of\r\nthese, the principal one was perhaps the custom--not by any means\r\nconsidered at that period professionally dishonorable--of keeping\r\nsecret the technique of certain operative procedures like that of\r\ncutting for stone in the bladder or that of the radical cure of hernia.\r\nSuch knowledge was treated as private property, and was very carefully\r\nhanded down from father to son, or was sold for a large sum of money to\r\ncertain surgeons who engaged, under oath, not to reveal the details to\r\nothers. Thus we are assured by Haeser that two such eminent surgeons as\r\nAmbroise Paré and Fabricius of Hilden were obliged to pay handsomely\r\nfor the information which they received from certain specialists\r\nconcerning their particular methods of procedure. It is from such\r\nscraps of information which come to our knowledge casually that we\r\noften learn the actual truth concerning the advance made at a given\r\nperiod of time by a certain department of medical science. Although it\r\nis not possible to fix the date when the custom to which I have just\r\nreferred was definitely abandoned, it may be stated as a fact that\r\nafter the seventeenth century very few instances of such ownership of\r\nsurgical secrets are discoverable in the records.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as at the very beginning of the Renaissance surgery was looked\r\nupon, in the southern and central parts of Europe, as an occupation of\r\na somewhat menial character, the regularly organized medical schools\r\nmade very inadequate provision for the proper education and training of\r\nthose young men who were disposed to adopt a surgical career. During\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries surgery was still tolerated at\r\nMontpellier, but after the papal seat had been removed from Avignon\r\nto Rome--that is, after 1479,--the pupils of that university were\r\nforbidden to do any surgical work. In 1490, however, a course in\r\nsurgery was provided for the exclusive use of barbers. At first the\r\ninstruction was given in Latin, but, as these men did not understand\r\nthis language, the professor was soon compelled to employ a barbaric\r\nLatin (half French and half Latin) in making his comments upon the\r\ntext of the lecture. This state of affairs lasted for more than a\r\ncentury. In fact, it was not until after Paré, Franco and Wuertz had\r\ndemonstrated by their remarkable careers how honorable was this branch\r\nof the science of medicine, that provision was made at Montpellier (in\r\n1597) for regular instruction in surgery. But even then, for a period\r\nof several years, it was found to be a very difficult matter to keep\r\nthe peace between the two groups of students--the medical and the\r\nsurgical; the governing authorities being finally obliged, in order\r\nto prevent the encounters which frequently took place between the\r\nrival bodies, to appoint four a.m. as the hour when the instruction in\r\nsurgery was to be given. Those students who were pursuing the course in\r\nmedicine looked upon the surgical pupils as intruders, as men unworthy\r\nto associate with them, and they availed themselves of every possible\r\nopportunity for making their connection with the university unpleasant.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the surgeons\r\nformed themselves into corporations. Minor surgery was left entirely\r\nin the hands of the barbers (a word which is derived from the Latin\r\n“_barbarus_,” uncultivated) and barber-surgeons. They were\r\nlargely itinerant practitioners and army surgeons. As they traveled\r\nfrom one city to another, the more enterprising ones announced their\r\napproach by means of a sort of herald who proclaimed loudly the cures\r\nwhich his chief was able to accomplish. In the course of time the\r\nsurgeons who lived in Paris formed themselves into the so-called\r\n“College of Surgeons.” At a later date (1255) there was established\r\nin that city by Jehan Pitard, the surgeon of Louis the Ninth (“Saint\r\nLouis,” 1215–1270), a more perfect organization under the name of\r\nthe “College of Saint Cosmas,” which was placed under the protection\r\nof Saints Cosmas and Damian. The members of this Brotherhood were\r\nknown as “Surgeons of the Long Robe,” to distinguish them from the\r\nBarber-Surgeons or “Surgeons of the Short Robe”; and they were also\r\nknown as “_Maitres Chirurgiens Jurés_.” Through the influence of\r\nPitard this organization received from the King a set of governing\r\nrules or constitution.\r\n\r\nIt may prove interesting to learn who Cosmas and Damian were, how they\r\ncame to be canonized, and for what reasons the organizers of the new\r\nbrotherhood preferred them to all others, as guardian saints. Cosmas\r\nand Damian were the youngest of five brothers who belonged to a family\r\nof some distinction in Arabia. They chose the career of peripatetic\r\nphysicians, and gave their services free to those who might have need\r\nof them. They spent some time in the Province of Cilicia, Asia Minor,\r\nand while in that country they met the death of martyrs, somewhere\r\nabout 287 A. D., during the persecutions of the Christians which\r\noccurred in the reign of Diocletian. In the church pictures they are\r\nrepresented as physicians, each one of whom holds in his hand either\r\na vessel containing a remedial preparation, or a staff around which\r\nthe emblematic serpent is twined, or (less frequently) a surgical\r\ninstrument of some kind. During the time of the Crusades there existed\r\nan Order of Knights of Saint Cosmas and Saint Damian, who devoted\r\nthemselves specially to the care of sick pilgrims and to the freeing of\r\nthose who were held as prisoners.\r\n\r\nIn all the large cities of France there existed, during the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries, corporations of surgeons, the great majority\r\nof whom belonged to the class or grade of barbers. These men were not\r\npermitted by their rules to use the knife, and, as a result, great\r\njealousy existed between them and the few who, having passed the\r\nrequired examination, were authorized to perform cutting operations\r\nand to assume the title of “Masters in Surgery.” In 1493, as the\r\nresult of an effort made by the barbers of Paris as a body, to gain\r\nsome knowledge of medical science, they obtained from the university\r\npermission to purchase a corpse which had not yet been removed from the\r\ngallows. They had, it appears, engaged a doctor of medicine to give\r\nthem instruction in anatomy, and it was upon a dissection of this body\r\nthat the teaching was to be based. In 1494 the Faculty made provision\r\nfor giving the barbers a regular course of lectures on surgery; and,\r\neleven years later (1505), additional privileges having in the meantime\r\nbeen granted them by the university, they organized the “Corporation\r\nof Barber Surgeons, or Surgeons of the Short Robe.” In the oath\r\nwhich the members of this organization were obliged to take, it is\r\nexpressly stated, among other things, that “they will give due honor\r\nand reverence to the Faculty, and will not administer any laxative or\r\nalterative drug.”\r\n\r\nFrom 1601 to 1731, when the _Académie de Chirurgie_ was founded,\r\nthere was an almost continuous series of squabbles between the surgeons\r\nand the barbers, on the one hand, and the Medical Faculty of the\r\nUniversity, on the other. At a still earlier period, dating back even\r\nto the fourteenth century, the quarrels were between the surgeons\r\n(École de St. Côme) and the barbers, but, during the seventeenth\r\ncentury and the early part of the eighteenth, the surgeons and the\r\nbarbers seem to have harmonized their interests and to have made common\r\ncause against the Faculty. An edict was issued by Louis the Twelfth\r\nin 1613 to the effect that the two corporations (the surgeons and\r\nthe barbers) should be fused into a single organization; and, even\r\nbefore this, it had become customary to employ the words “surgeon” and\r\n“barber” as synonymous terms. Finally, in the years 1644, 1645 and\r\n1656, further agreements were entered into by the two bodies. After the\r\nfounding of the Academy of Surgery in 1731 nothing further is heard of\r\nbarber-surgeons.\r\n\r\nIn the account which I have thus far given of the agencies that were\r\navailable during the Renaissance for the perpetuation and increase of\r\nmedical knowledge, I make reference only to the established medical\r\nschools and to the less pretentious but much more practical teaching\r\norganizations furnished by the guilds or brotherhoods. In my remarks\r\nI have said little or nothing about hospitals, which--potentially, at\r\nleast,--have a great deal to do with the advance of medical knowledge,\r\nespecially in the department of surgery. Unfortunately, my efforts to\r\nprocure information relating to this subject have not been rewarded\r\nwith much success and I shall therefore not be able to furnish more\r\nthan a few disconnected and very imperfect details.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century the city of Lyons possessed\r\n(and it still possesses) the oldest hospital in France--viz., the\r\nHôtel-Dieu,--which was founded by Childebert the First in 542 A. D.\r\nThe city itself was at that period second in importance only to\r\nParis, and in some respects it was the equal of the metropolis in\r\ncelebrity. The art of printing was introduced there in 1472, and the\r\npresses of that city were soon reckoned the best in Europe. Many\r\nmedical books were published at Lyons. François Rabelais (1483–1553),\r\nthe celebrated author of the humorous and satirical works “Gargantua”\r\nand “Pantagruel,” was a regularly educated physician, and during his\r\nresidence at Lyons he edited various works of Hippocrates and Galen.\r\nMichael Servetus, who displayed such marked ability by his researches\r\nin regard to the circulation of the blood, was also a resident of Lyons\r\nfrom 1530 to 1543. Some idea of the way in which a large hospital was\r\nmanaged in those early days may be gained from the following statement\r\nof facts: In 1619 as many as five patients were permitted to occupy\r\none bed in Hôtel-Dieu at Lyons. Although the hospital possessed\r\naccommodations for a total of five hundred and forty-nine patients\r\n(including pilgrims and poor people), there was only one medical man\r\nwhose duty it was to look after the surgical cases, and he resided\r\noutside the building. At a somewhat later date there was provided a\r\n“_chirurgien principal_,” whose duty it was to give the needed\r\nsurgical care to this class of patients, and who was obliged to\r\nreside in the hospital. When this chief surgeon required assistance\r\nin the dressing of wounds, etc., he was authorized to make use of\r\nthe “apothecary’s boy.” The stock of surgical instruments possessed\r\nby the hospital in 1543 comprised the following items: One uterine\r\nspeculum; one trephine, which was composed of thirteen separate\r\nparts; one mouth-plug, for use in keeping the jaws separated; one\r\near speculum; and one elevatorium. All these facts, taken together,\r\nfurnish strongly corroborative evidence of the statement made by von\r\nGurlt in his _Geschichte der Chirurgie_, viz., that in France,\r\nduring the sixteenth century, the occupation of surgeon was considered\r\nby the community but little better than that of a hair-cutter. It\r\nis therefore not surprising that the great hospital of Lyons should\r\nhave been managed at that time in accordance with such a low sanitary\r\nstandard and with an almost total disregard of the purposes for which\r\na hospital exists. So far as I am able to learn, the conditions just\r\ndescribed were not peculiar to the city of Lyons. “During the reign of\r\nFrancis the First (1515–1547) there were in the main room (thirty-six\r\nfeet wide) of the Infirmary of Hôtel-Dieu at Paris,” says Boisseau,\r\n“six rows of beds (three feet wide), each one of which accommodated\r\nordinarily three (at times even four) sick persons, who necessarily\r\nwere very uncomfortable. This is not all; for there were also in this\r\nsame infirmary seven or eight beds which were designed to accommodate\r\nfrom twenty-five to thirty infants or young children, the great\r\nmajority of whom died from the poor quality of air which they had to\r\nbreathe in that institution.” I do not need to furnish additional\r\nproofs in corroboration of the truth of the statement that during the\r\nRenaissance the French civil hospitals contributed practically nothing\r\nto the advance of medical science. It is possible that in Italy these\r\ninstitutions may have been better managed, for, in the account which he\r\ngives of his trip to Rome, Luther speaks of having visited a hospital\r\nwhich particularly attracted his notice by reason of its orderliness\r\nand the conspicuous cleanliness of every part of the building. As an\r\noffset, however, to this favorable testimony I should state that in\r\nsome documents discovered in comparatively recent times there are\r\nmemoranda relating to the duties of the medical staff in the civil\r\nhospital of Padua (1569)--a city in which was located the most famous\r\nmedical school to be found anywhere in Europe during the sixteenth\r\ncentury. These memoranda read as follows: “There shall be a doctor of\r\nphysic upon whom rests the duty of visiting all the poor patients in\r\nthe building, females as well as males; a doctor of surgery whose duty\r\nit is to apply ointments to all the poor people in the hospital who\r\nhave wounds of any kind; and a barber who is competent to do, for the\r\nwomen as well as for the men, all the other things that a good surgeon\r\nusually does.” (The word “surgeon” is evidently employed here in the\r\nsense of barber-surgeon, and not in the modern sense of the word.) This\r\ntestimony and that furnished on a preceding page with regard to the\r\nmanagement at the two leading civil hospitals in France amply justify\r\nthe statement that during the sixteenth century medicine received no\r\naid whatever from these institutions in its efforts to advance.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of orderliness I shall, from this point onward, arrange\r\nthe information which I may find it desirable to furnish, under the\r\nheadings of the different countries of Europe; and in carrying out\r\nthis plan I shall begin with Germany, as it was there that the oldest\r\nfifteenth-century treatises on practical surgery were first printed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n      SURGERY IN GERMANY AND SWITZERLAND DURING THE FIFTEENTH AND\r\n                          SIXTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were five men in Germany and German Switzerland who, during the\r\nRenaissance, attained distinction as surgeons, and who at the same\r\ntime contributed, by their published writings as well as by the force\r\nof example, to the advancement of medical science. The names of these\r\nfive surgeons are: Pfolspeundt, Brunschwig, von Gerssdorff, Fabricius\r\nof Hilden and Felix Wuertz. The first three mentioned were born in the\r\nearly part of the fifteenth century, and all five of them derived their\r\npractical knowledge of surgery in large measure from their experience\r\nin warfare. Individual sketches of these men will be furnished farther\r\non, but I believe that these will be better understood if a brief\r\naccount of the state of medical education in general throughout\r\nGermany, at the period which I am now considering, be first supplied.\r\n\r\n_State of Medical Education in General Throughout Germany\r\n(1400–1600)._--The University of Heidelberg was founded in 1386,\r\nbut it was not until about 1550 that the first beginnings of medical\r\nteaching made their appearance in that institution. Equally feeble\r\nattempts were made, twenty years later, to organize the teaching of\r\nmedicine at the University of Wuertzburg; but very little appears to\r\nhave been accomplished during the immediately following years, as may\r\nbe judged from the official announcement, in 1587, of what things\r\nthe Professor of Surgery would teach in the three-years’ course.\r\n“_First year_: Lectures on the subject of tumors, in accordance\r\nwith the teachings of Galen; _Second year_: Lectures on the\r\nsubjects of wounds and ulcers, in accordance with the teachings of\r\nGalen and Hippocrates and the Arabian medical writers; _Third\r\nyear_: Lectures on fractures and dislocations, in accordance with\r\nthe teachings of Galen and Hippocrates. Then, if sufficient time\r\nis available during this last year of the course, a certain amount\r\nof anatomy is to be taught (during the winter season) from Galen’s\r\nwritings on this subject. In the summer time the subject of simple\r\nremedies may be taken up advantageously, and botanical demonstrations\r\nmay also be given.” Von Gurlt quotes Koelliker as his authority for\r\nthe statement that throughout the seventeenth century the medical and\r\nsurgical teaching at the University of Wuertzburg was very defective,\r\n“almost nothing worthy of mention being accomplished during that long\r\nperiod in the departments of anatomy and physiology.” In the University\r\nof Basel, Switzerland, which was founded in 1460, medical teaching\r\nwas as barren as it was in all the German universities at that early\r\nperiod. It was only in 1542 that the first public dissection of a\r\nhuman body took place there. Vesalius was visiting the city at that\r\ntime for the purpose of superintending the printing of his great work\r\non anatomy, and the university authorities availed themselves of the\r\nopportunity to secure from him not only this single demonstration, but\r\nalso in addition a course of lectures on anatomy. Fifteen years later,\r\nFelix Platter, a native of Basel and a man of exceptional ability\r\n(see sketch on pp. 332 _et seq._), made the first postmortem\r\nexamination known to have been made in that city. Two years later\r\nstill (1559), following in the footsteps of Vesalius, he made a public\r\ndissection of a criminal’s corpse in the Church of St. Elizabeth.\r\nFrom 1581 onward, with occasional omissions, a public dissection of\r\nthe corpse of a criminal was made by the professor of anatomy once\r\nevery year. In 1590 the question was discussed by the Faculty whether\r\nit “might not also be practicable to secure from the hospital, for\r\ndissection, an occasional corpse.” The first body obtained from this\r\nsource was dissected in 1604, but it was not until 1669 that a second\r\none was available. There was no museum of anatomy and the medical\r\nschool owned only two human skeletons--one male, that had been set\r\nup by Vesalius, and one female which had been prepared by Platter.\r\nDuring the first two hundred years of the existence of this university,\r\nonly twenty-three copies of the different writings of Hippocrates, of\r\nGalen, of Dioscorides and of Paulus Aegineta were available for the\r\ninstruction of the medical students. “These books should be diligently\r\nread aloud to the young men if their contents are to furnish the\r\nmaximum of useful information.” As for clinical instruction, each\r\nstudent was expected to secure for himself, by private arrangement\r\nwith some active practitioner, the position of assistant, or to obtain\r\nfrom the Archiater or City Physician an occasional opportunity of\r\nseeing patients at the hospital. According to the rules established by\r\nthe Faculty the students were permitted to take private courses with\r\ndifferent physicians. Another and very valuable source of information\r\nthat was within the reach of these young men, was supplied by the\r\npublic disputations which were held quite frequently.\r\n\r\nThe preceding brief account, which I have compiled from von Gurlt’s\r\nwork, will serve, as I believe, to convey a fairly clear idea of the\r\nprimitive and very limited opportunities of acquiring a knowledge of\r\nmedicine and surgery which were afforded the student in Germany during\r\nthe fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. (It should be borne in mind that\r\nBasel, although located in Switzerland, was in nearly all respects a\r\nGerman city.) It was not until a much later period that the schools of\r\nthat country, in nearly every department of human knowledge, caught\r\nup with and eventually surpassed--at least for a number of years--the\r\nsimilar institutions in Italy and France.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 18. CONSULTATION BY THREE PHYSICIANS UPON A CASE\r\n  OF WOUND IN THE CHEST.\r\n\r\n  (From a woodcut in the _Surgery of Hieronymus Brunschwig_,\r\n  Strassburg, 1508.)\r\n\r\n  This treatise, which was written by the author in 1497, passed\r\n  through nine successive editions, the last one in 1539. Probably\r\n  no woodcuts of a higher order of merit than those represented in\r\n  this and the two following illustrations (Figs. XIX and XX) are\r\n  to be found in medical literature.]\r\n\r\n_Hieronymus Brunschwig._--Hieronymus Brunschwig was born at\r\nStrassburg during the early part of the fifteenth century, the exact\r\ndate not being known. It is believed that he attained a great age, some\r\neven claiming that he was one hundred and ten years old at the time of\r\nhis death. His treatise on surgery, bearing the simple title “_Das\r\nbuchler Wund Artzeny_,” was first published in 1497,\r\nwhen he was already an old man, and it passed through nine editions\r\nduring the following forty-two years. It was also twice translated\r\ninto English. Up to the time of the discovery of Pfolspeundt’s work\r\nit was believed to be the oldest German treatise on surgery known. It\r\nwas very freely illustrated with original woodcuts, not a few of which\r\npossess considerable artistic merit. (See accompanying reproduction.)\r\nThe following headings of some of the more important chapters will\r\nconvey at least a fair idea of the character of the book: “Definition\r\nof the Word ‘Surgeon’”; “Anatomy”; “Fatality of Wounds in Different\r\nParts of the Body”; “Different Kinds of Wounds”; “Different Kinds of\r\nSurgical Instruments”; “Different Modes of Ligating Blood-Vessels”;\r\n“Wounds of Blood-Vessels and Nerves”; “Methods of Arresting Bleeding”;\r\n“Foreign Bodies in Wounds”; “Treatment of Wounds Inflicted by Poisoned\r\nArrows”; “Bruised or Crushed Wounds”; “Stab Wounds”; “Bites and\r\nStings”; “Wounds of the Head”; “Operations for Hare-Lip”; and several\r\nother chapters on wounds and pathological conditions of other parts of\r\nthe body. Syphilis is not once mentioned in the book; and from this\r\ncircumstance von Gurlt infers that a knowledge of the existence of\r\nthis disease had not yet, at that early date (1497), reached Germany.\r\nIn Brunschwig’s _Liber pestilentialis, etc._, however, which was\r\nprinted three years later, syphilis is incidentally mentioned as the\r\n“_malefrancose_” or “_malum mortuum_.” That Brunschwig was\r\nwell informed in the earlier surgical literature is shown by the fact\r\nthat he quotes from the writings of Theodoric, Guillaume de Saliceto,\r\nGuy de Chauliac, Henri de Mondeville, and many others. A hasty and\r\nnecessarily very superficial perusal of the text of a few of the more\r\nimportant chapters of this remarkable book satisfies me that Brunschwig\r\ndeserves to be classed among the really great surgeons of the fifteenth\r\nand sixteenth centuries. A copy of this rare book may be seen in the\r\nSurgeon-General’s Library at Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n_Heinrich von Pfolspeundt._--The earliest German treatise\r\nrelating to surgery is that which bears the title “_Buch der\r\nBündth-Ertznei_,” by Heinrich von Pfolspeundt, “_Bruder des\r\ndeutschen Ordens_.” It was written in 1460, and was first published\r\nin printed form in 1868 by H. Haeser and A. Middeldorpf, Berlin.\r\nThe text of this very early German work on the practice of surgery\r\nfurnishes ample evidence to show that the author was worthy to be\r\nranked among the leading surgeons of the fifteenth century. At page\r\nfifty-seven, says von Gurlt, may be read the remarkable statement that,\r\nin the case of a wound of the intestinal canal, one may cut through\r\nthat organ at the point of injury and then introduce into the opposite\r\nends of the divided bowel a silver tube the margins of which have been\r\ncarefully bent so as not to offer at any point a cutting edge. The\r\ntube may then be tied in place with thread of green silk. (Von Gurlt\r\nspeaks of this as the forerunner of Murphy’s button.) Speaking of\r\nwounds caused by arrows, Pfolspeundt says that, to insure the patient’s\r\nrecovery, the planet under which he happens at that time to be, should\r\nbe in favorable conjunction. In one case which came under Pfolspeundt’s\r\ncare he was obliged to pay an astrologer the sum of fifty gulden in\r\norder to ascertain whether the planet in question was or was not in a\r\nfavorable conjunction.\r\n\r\nThere is only one place in the entire book, says von Gurlt, where a\r\ngunshot wound is mentioned, and then only incidentally; but this is\r\npositively the first reference (about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury) to such wounds discoverable in medical literature.\r\n\r\nAmong the topics which are treated quite fully and in such a manner as\r\nto show clearly that the author was well versed in at least this part\r\nof operative surgery, those relating to rhinoplasty deserve to receive\r\nspecial mention. From the viewpoint of history, this part of the book\r\nis of very great importance. In no other treatise, says von Gurlt, do\r\nwe find an equally detailed and satisfactory account of the operative\r\nmethod employed by the Two Brancas (father and son, from Catania,\r\nItaly), who were contemporaries of Pfolspeundt. The latter learned this\r\nmethod from an Italian surgeon, whose name he does not mention, and\r\nhe was particularly careful not to divulge the essential details to\r\nanybody except two of his brethren in the Order to which he belonged.\r\n\r\nFor anaesthetic purposes in operative cases, Pfolspeundt was in the\r\nhabit of employing sponges saturated with the juices of opium, Atropa\r\nmandragora, Conium maculatum, Hedera helix or arborosa, Lactuca and\r\nDaphne mezereum; his technique resembling very closely that employed by\r\nGuy de Chauliac, Theodoric and others. (See the appropriate chapters in\r\nthe earlier part of this volume.)\r\n\r\nIn his remarks upon the manner of bringing about the healing of an open\r\nwound, Pfolspeundt says that “in all cases he tries to dispense with\r\nstitches, but that, when he finds such support necessary, he first\r\nspreads a thick layer of adhesive material over both margins of the\r\nwound and afterward introduces the threaded needle through the mass\r\ninto the skin. Then, in order to bring the edges of the wound together,\r\nhe draws the thread taut and makes it fast by means of a very small\r\nknot.... Whether the sharp fever which sometimes sets in afterward as\r\na complication, is due to simple inflammation or to erysipelas, is a\r\nquestion which cannot always be decided; and it is still more difficult\r\nto determine whether the thin watery secretion which sometimes develops\r\nin a wound may not signify--as some writers maintain--the beginning of\r\nsuppuration in a joint.”\r\n\r\nWere it not for the difficulty which one experiences in translating\r\ncorrectly the ancient provincial German of Pfolspeundt’s text, I might\r\nreadily furnish further examples of his surgical pathology and methods\r\nof treatment. The few, however, which I have already given will have to\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 19. BARBER-SURGEON (_WUNDARZT_) EXTRACTING\r\n  AN ARROW FROM A WOUNDED SOLDIER’S CHEST WHILE THE BATTLE IS STILL IN\r\n  PROGRESS.\r\n\r\n  (From the _Feldbuch der Wundarznei_ of Hans von Gerssdorff, first\r\n  published in 1517; many later editions followed.)]\r\n\r\n_Hans von Gerssdorff._--Hans von Gerssdorff, who was also called\r\n“Schielhans” (squint-eyed Hans), was born in Strassburg about the\r\nmiddle of the fifteenth century. He was a bold and skilful surgeon,\r\nand acquired a wide experience and great self-confidence from his long\r\nservice in connection with the army. He was present, for example, at\r\nthe famous battles of Grandson (1476, in Switzerland) and Nancy (1477,\r\nin France), in both of which the slaughter was very great, and in both\r\nalso Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, was badly beaten. In 1517 von\r\nGerssdorff published at Strassburg a treatise on military surgery,\r\nunder the title: “_Feldbuch der Wundartzney_.” This book, which\r\nis illustrated with exceptionally good woodcuts, two specimens of\r\nwhich are here reproduced (Figs. 19 and 20), contains the earliest\r\ndiscussion of gunshot wounds; and, in his remarks on the proper manner\r\nof treating such wounds, von Gerssdorff leads one to infer that he\r\nshared, although somewhat hesitatingly, the at that time prevailing\r\nbelief that these wounds are poisoned. He was a pronounced advocate of\r\nthe use of the red-hot cautery in cases of serious hemorrhage from a\r\nwound. When it was found that the ball had penetrated the flesh to some\r\ndepth, he recommended that it be cut out; and if, after the removal\r\nof the missile, the patient complained of much pain in the wound, hot\r\noil was to be poured into it freely. Before the employment of firearms\r\nin warfare, amputation of a limb was rarely performed--that is, only\r\nin cases where gangrene had developed in the corresponding hand or\r\nfoot. But von Gerssdorff assures us that, up to the time of writing\r\nhis “_Feldbuch_,” he had personally performed “nearly two hundred\r\namputations.” This great increase in the frequency of performing this\r\noperation is clearly to be attributed to the increased use of the new\r\nagent--gunpowder--in warfare. In this operation, according to his own\r\ndeclaration, von Gerssdorff was not in the habit of suturing the flaps.\r\nInstead, he brought the opposing edges together and then covered the\r\nstump thus formed with the bladder of some animal. There are a number\r\nof other interesting details relating to von Gerssdorff’s manner of\r\nconducting this important operation, but it is not practicable to give\r\nup the space that would be required for a satisfactory description of\r\nthem. There is one point, however, to which I may be permitted to refer\r\nvery briefly in this place, viz., the manner in which the surgeons of\r\nthis and even much earlier periods secured a fairly satisfactory degree\r\nof local anaesthesia when they had occasion to perform an amputation.\r\nThey produced insensibility of the part by tying a band tightly around\r\nthe limb a short distance above the spot at which the amputation was\r\nto be performed. At a somewhat later period, as in the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century, artificial anaesthesia was also effected through\r\nthe application of snow or ice to the part.\r\n\r\nThe date of von Gerssdorff’s death is not known.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 20. AMPUTATION OF THE LEG.\r\n\r\n  (From Hans von Gerssdorff’s _Feldbuch der Wundarznei_.)\r\n\r\n  Von Gurlt says that this is the earliest known pictorial\r\n  illustration of the amputation of a limb.]\r\n\r\n_Fabricius of Hilden._--Fabricius Hildanus--or Fabricius of\r\nHilden, near Düsseldorf--was born in 1560 and received his early\r\ntraining in surgery from Cosmas Slotanus, a pupil of Vesalius and the\r\nfirst barber-surgeon of Duke Wilhelm of Guelich-Cleve-Berg (eighteen\r\nmiles northeast of Aix-la-Chapelle). In 1585 he visited Geneva,\r\nSwitzerland, and continued his studies in that city under the guidance\r\nof Jean Griffon, one of the most distinguished surgeons of that period.\r\nAfter leaving Geneva he practiced medicine at Cologne, and during that\r\nperiod (1591–1596) steadily increased his reputation as a skilful\r\nsurgeon, particularly well versed in anatomy. But he appears to have\r\nacquired a strong liking for Switzerland and for the professional\r\nfriends whom he had gained in that country; and consequently it is not\r\nsurprising to learn that, during the later years of his life, he spent\r\nlong periods of time in Geneva, Lausanne and Berne, in the last of\r\nwhich cities he filled the office of City Physician. He died in 1634,\r\nat the age of seventy-four, full of honors and greatly beloved by all\r\nwho knew him.\r\n\r\nFabricius of Hilden laid great stress upon the importance, to the\r\nsurgeon, of a thorough grounding in anatomy. He had been profoundly\r\nimpressed by the fact that his instructor at Geneva, Jean Griffon,\r\nnever undertook an important operation until after he had refreshed\r\nhis memory by a dissection of the region involved. He was also much\r\ninterested in pathological anatomy, and always availed himself of every\r\npossible opportunity for making a postmortem examination. As evidence\r\nof the slowness with which news of important scientific discoveries,\r\nparticularly in the domain of medicine, traveled in those days I may\r\nmention here the fact that, up to the time of his death in 1634,\r\nFabricius had not heard of Harvey’s great discovery of the circulation\r\nof the blood (1628). Although he gained distinction in more than one\r\nfield of medicine his greatest reputation was unquestionably gained in\r\nthat of surgery; and his success in this field was to be ascribed to\r\nhis profound knowledge of anatomy, to his inventive genius, and to his\r\ngreat technical skill. He insisted very strongly upon the importance,\r\nfor the surgeon, of possessing good instruments and well-constructed\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nIf we compare Fabricius of Hilden with Ambroise Paré we are obliged\r\nto admit that the latter, although decidedly inferior to his rival in\r\nscientific training, was the greater surgeon of the two. It is perhaps\r\nworth recording that Paracelsus and Wuertz were Fabricius’ bitter\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nOf his published contributions to surgical literature, the most\r\nimportant are to be found in the work entitled: “_Observationum et\r\ncurationum chirurgicarum centuriae VII._,” published at Lyons in\r\n1641.\r\n\r\n_Felix Wuertz._--Felix Wuertz was born at Zurich, Switzerland,\r\nbetween the years 1500 and 1510 (the exact date is not known). As to\r\nhis early life and surroundings I am only able to say that his father\r\nwas a painter, that he himself took service under a barber, and that\r\nat the end of two or three years, after he had learned the details of\r\nthis branch of work, he started out on his travels over Europe in the\r\ncharacter of a barber’s apprentice, as was, in those days, the regular\r\ncustom with apprentices of all trades or occupations. In this way he\r\nvisited such cities as Bamberg, Pforzheim, Nuernberg, Padua and Rome,\r\nin each of which he spent a certain length of time as an aid to those\r\nsurgeons who were willing to employ him. It is not unlikely that it was\r\nduring this wandering period of his life that he gained some experience\r\nin the treatment of gunshot wounds. In 1536, after an absence of\r\nfour or five years, he returned to his native city and was regularly\r\nenrolled as a member of the barbers’ guild. During the following twenty\r\nyears he carried on the practice of medicine and surgery, but more\r\nparticularly the latter, with ever-increasing success. In 1559, for\r\nreasons which are not mentioned by any of his biographers, he left\r\nZurich and established himself in Strassburg; and then, at the end of\r\nanother ten or twelve years, he again changed his residence, this time\r\ngiving the preference to Basel, a Swiss city located at the boundary\r\nline between Germany and Switzerland. The exact date of Wuertz’s\r\ndeath is not known, but--from various facts which he mentions in his\r\nbook--it may be inferred that it occurred in 1576, and that he was\r\nresiding at the time in the house of his son, who had the same name\r\nas himself and was also a surgeon. The title of the treatise which he\r\nwrote and which passed through a number of editions between the years\r\n1563 and 1651,--not to mention translations into the French and Dutch\r\nlanguages--was: “_Practica der Wundarznei_” (The Treatment of\r\nSurgical Affections).\r\n\r\nMalgaigne--says von Gurlt, in his History of Surgery--does not hesitate\r\nto speak of Wuertz as one of the three greatest surgeons of the\r\nsixteenth century (Franco and Ambroise Paré being the other two); and\r\nvon Gurlt adds that Wuertz’s “_Practica_” is rich in facts which\r\nhe had gathered from his own experience in everyday practice, and upon\r\nwhich he makes comments that really represent his own views and not\r\nthose of various other authors. The leading principles which guided\r\nWuertz in his treatment of wounds of all kinds are thus formulated by\r\nhim:--\r\n\r\n   Keep them as neat and clean as possible, and disturb them as\r\n   little as you can; so far as may be practicable, exclude the\r\n   air; favor healing under a scab; and do not give the patient a\r\n   lowering diet, but feed him as you would a woman recovering from\r\n   her confinement.\r\n\r\nAccording to von Gurlt, Wuertz attached relatively small importance\r\nto healing by first intention, and only in rare cases did he make\r\nspecial efforts to secure this result. On the other hand, he availed\r\nhimself of every opportunity to enter his protest against some of\r\nthe bad tendencies which had somewhat suddenly made their appearance\r\nin the practice of surgery in his day, and more especially “against\r\nthe almost universal employment of caustics and the red-hot iron for\r\narresting bleeding; against the uncalled-for and positively harmful\r\nhabit of repeatedly probing a wound; against the unreasonable practice\r\nof inserting tents into wounds; against the uncontrolled application\r\nof mushy poultices to wounds; and against the excessive employment of\r\nbloodletting in the treatment of wounds.” He exhibited his conservatism\r\nin still other ways. Thus, for example, he was very slow in reaching a\r\ndecision to amputate a limb or to remove splinters or larger portions\r\nof loose bone from a wound, for he put greater trust in the reparative\r\npowers of Nature than did most of the surgeons of that day. Wuertz was\r\nalso slower than were most of them in resorting to the operation of\r\ntrephining the skull. His ideas with regard to the nature of gunshot\r\nwounds were not very clear, for he still believed that the projectile\r\ncaused some burning and a certain degree of poisoning of the wound;\r\nbut he condemned all unnecessary efforts at extraction, especially by\r\nmeans of complicated instruments. It was better, he said, to wait until\r\nthe bullet or other missile manifested its presence at some easily\r\naccessible spot in the body.\r\n\r\nThe statements made above bring out some of the good features\r\nof Wuertz’s treatise. This work, however, says von Gurlt, also\r\ncontains not a few bad features, and among them he mentions the fact\r\nthat it abounds in repetitions and in evidences of the author’s\r\nsuperstitiousness.\r\n\r\nSome of Wuertz’s comments on the symptoms which occasionally develop in\r\ncases of injury to the head, and the suggestions which he makes as to\r\nthe treatment that should be adopted, throw considerable light upon his\r\nmode of procedure in the presence of certain surgical phenomena. The\r\nfollowing clinical lesson is based upon three hypothetical developments\r\nin a case of cranial injuries:--\r\n\r\n   (1) The patient’s wound in the head, let us suppose, has to\r\n   all appearances healed, when it unexpectedly becomes swollen\r\n   and painful and begins to discharge again. What measures are\r\n   indicated under these circumstances? The wound should at once\r\n   be freely reopened, for it may confidently be assumed that such\r\n   a lighting up of the local symptoms is due either to a loose\r\n   splinter of bone that is trying to escape or to the presence of\r\n   a small area of bone caries. If, under these circumstances, you\r\n   should not establish a free opening a large abscess will surely\r\n   collect in that region and will soon make for itself a new\r\n   outlet.\r\n\r\n   (2) If the patient complains that he has constant pain in his\r\n   head on the same side as that on which the injury was originally\r\n   inflicted, that the pain is steadily increasing in severity,\r\n   and that in addition he feels a sensation of pulsation in his\r\n   head; and if, furthermore, you inspect closely the site of\r\n   the original wound, and pass your finger cautiously over the\r\n   spot, but fail to discover any appreciable external swelling,\r\n   you may feel almost certain that a splinter or a spicule of\r\n   bone projects from the inner table of the skull cap into the\r\n   substance of the brain. Then, when the surgeon believes that\r\n   the condition as just described truly represents the existing\r\n   intracranial lesions, he should not hesitate to make an opening\r\n   in the calvarium over the affected spot and remove the offending\r\n   splinter.\r\n\r\n   (3) If the patient, after the external wound has healed,\r\n   complains of a throbbing and roaring in his head, not merely in\r\n   the region of the actual injury but involving the entire head,\r\n   and if the symptoms tend rather to increase than to diminish,\r\n   and eventually become so severe that the patient is almost\r\n   beside himself with the pain, then is the surgeon justified in\r\n   believing that a clot of blood is imprisoned somewhere beneath\r\n   the cranium and is gradually being converted into an abscess or\r\n   a condition of ulceration. And if at the same time some swelling\r\n   appears in the vicinity of the eyes, or if a bloody and purulent\r\n   discharge begins to flow from the nose or the ears, he may not\r\n   merely entertain a belief that his diagnosis is correct, but\r\n   may assert with positiveness that the lesions just named really\r\n   exist. And then the proper treatment for him to adopt is [in\r\n   essentials] the following: The head having first been shaved\r\n   over the site of the original wound, make a crucial incision\r\n   through the scalp and pericranium, turn the flaps back, apply\r\n   a strong, sharp-edged chisel to the surface of the bone, and\r\n   remove enough of the cranium to afford a satisfactory view\r\n   of the underlying parts. [Among the effects first observed]\r\n   probably pus will well up into the opening, and the patient will\r\n   then experience relief; and if a spicule of bone comes into\r\n   view, remove it forthwith. The plan of treatment here suggested\r\n   is the only one which can be trusted to effect a cure in a\r\n   case like that which is now being considered.... If a boring\r\n   instrument is employed for making an opening in the bone, be\r\n   careful not to allow any of the chips made by the borer to enter\r\n   or remain in the cranial cavity. Some surgeons teach that, if\r\n   pus be not found at the first opening, a second one should be\r\n   made at the distance of a finger’s breadth from the first, and\r\n   that the intervening bone should be broken down with a strong\r\n   and sharp knife so as to convert the two into a single opening.\r\n   [Wuertz adds that he had never found it necessary to act in\r\n   accordance with this advice.] After the pus or clot of blood\r\n   has been removed, one may as a rule readily discover the true\r\n   cause of the pain and other symptoms. As a final step, suitable\r\n   dressings should be applied to the wound.\r\n\r\nAnother important department of practical surgery, in which Wuertz\r\nappears to have gained special distinction, is that which relates to\r\nwounds and certain diseases of the abdomen. Owing to lack of space it\r\nwill not be practicable to reproduce here any histories of the cases of\r\nthis nature which came under his observation, but I believe that the\r\nfollowing brief extracts from his remarks upon the best way of treating\r\nthem may in some measure answer the same purpose:--\r\n\r\n   Penetrating wounds of the abdomen are universally admitted to\r\n   be very dangerous, no matter what organs (stomach, intestines,\r\n   liver, gall-bladder, spleen or kidneys) be involved in the\r\n   injury. In the case of a wound of the liver or spleen it is not\r\n   advisable to employ sutures; instead, one may use some kind of\r\n   sticking plaster for bringing the edges of the wound together.\r\n   Proper regulation of the diet plays an important part in the\r\n   treatment of these conditions, and so also may venesection. When\r\n   an intestine is the organ wounded I adopt the plan of treatment\r\n   recommended by most authorities; that is, I stitch together the\r\n   opposite edges of the wound and I cleanse the surface of the\r\n   bowel carefully with milk that has been well saturated with the\r\n   juice of anise seeds.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks about the treatment of suppurative processes involving\r\nthe thigh in the vicinity of the knee, Wuertz gives the following\r\nadvice:--\r\n\r\n   Do not allow the knee to remain quiet, but stretch the\r\n   surrounding parts and manipulate them as much as you can, in\r\n   order that the joint may not become permanently rigid; for if\r\n   you wait until the healing is completed before you resort to\r\n   these measures you will often find that it is already too late.\r\n\r\nSeparate chapters are devoted to such topics as would to-day receive\r\nthe designations “pyaemia,” “hospital gangrene,” and “septicaemia”;\r\nand in a separate short treatise which deals with the various ailments\r\nof young children, Wuertz mentions the fact that he once suffered\r\ngreatly for ten days from an attack of migraine (hemicrania) and that\r\nhe experienced marked and permanent relief only after the operation\r\nof arteriotomy had been performed upon his left temporal artery. In\r\nanother part of the volume he expresses himself in terms which justify\r\nthe belief that he must have performed amputation of the thigh on\r\none or more occasions. He does not, it is true, furnish any details\r\nregarding the indications that point to the necessity of resorting\r\nto this operation, nor does he state how it should be carried out;\r\nhe simply makes the remark, while speaking of the employment of the\r\nred-hot cautery iron in arresting hemorrhage, that “it is useful in\r\namputation of a limb, particularly in the thicker part of the thigh,\r\nand occasionally in other places, as in the removal of a tumor by the\r\nuse of the knife.” So far as I am aware, Celsus was the first among\r\nancient writers on surgery to say anything about amputations, and what\r\nhe does say on this subject consists simply of quotations from still\r\nearlier writers--from Archigenes, Leonides and Heliodorus, surgeons\r\nwhose writings no longer exist except in the form of detached extracts\r\nthat appear in more modern treatises. The portions of text which Celsus\r\nquotes show clearly that the surgeons whom I have just named were in\r\nthe habit of making flap operations in cases of amputation above the\r\nelbow and above the knee; and Archigenes even taught the advisability\r\nof first ligating the larger supply blood-vessels before one proceeds\r\nto the amputation of a limb.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarks which Wuertz makes in one or two places it is easy\r\nto see that he was often not a little annoyed by the criticisms which\r\nhis professional brethren made with regard to some of his methods of\r\nprocedure. Thus, for example, he boldly declares that one’s experience\r\nis of much greater value than any rule that may have been laid down by\r\nthe ancients.\r\n\r\n   There can be no doubt, he says, that the ancients occasionally\r\n   displayed great ignorance and great want of judgment, just as\r\n   happens in our own time.... How much do you suppose I care\r\n   whether Galen’s, or Avicenna’s, or Guy de Chauliac’s opinion\r\n   does or does not agree with mine? Every such opinion--it should\r\n   be remembered--was, at one time or another in their day, a new\r\n   [and therefore unproved] opinion.... In practical surgery much\r\n   more importance attaches to the manner in which one carries out\r\n   one’s manipulations, and to the amount of experience which one\r\n   may have acquired, than to the length of time which one devotes\r\n   to windy consultations.\r\n\r\nFortune conferred very few favors upon Wuertz in the course of his\r\ncareer; the aid granted by kings and princes played no part in the\r\nmoulding of his character; his greatness was entirely due to his\r\nown unaided efforts. Paré, on the other hand, was certainly one of\r\nFortune’s favorites. He, too, like Franco and Wuertz, began his\r\nprofessional life as a barber’s apprentice, but, as he was made of\r\na much finer clay, the ultimate product of his development was a\r\nprincely surgeon, perhaps no more efficient or skilful than his two\r\ndistinguished contemporaries, but unquestionably more many-sided,\r\nmore lovable than either of them. On the other hand, Wuertz rendered\r\na most valuable service to the science of surgery by his close and\r\npatient study of certain symptoms which his confrères had overlooked\r\nor incorrectly interpreted (such, for example, as pyaemia, hospital\r\ngangrene and septicaemia); and he thus established the fact that these\r\nwere in reality independent diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n      THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURGERY IN ITALY DURING THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the fifteenth, all of the sixteenth and the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth centuries quite a large number of Italian\r\nsurgeons attained honorable distinction by the contributions which they\r\nmade to the science of medicine; and even in the neighboring Latin\r\ncountries of Spain and Portugal,--countries in which the force of the\r\nrevival of all departments of learning had made itself felt to a much\r\nfeebler degree, and in which at the same time the opposition to such\r\nrevival was much more active,--several surgeons succeeded in winning\r\ncreditable places for themselves in the history of their art. The names\r\nof the Italian surgeons are as follows: Giovanni da Vigo, Bartolommeo\r\nMaggi, Marianus Sanctus, Fallopius, Carcano Leone, Fabricius ab\r\nAcquapendente, Aranzi and Tagliacozzi. I will now add brief notices of\r\nthe careers of all these men, in order to convey at least some idea of\r\nthe grounds upon which their claim to honorable distinction rests.\r\n\r\nGiovanni da Vigo--perhaps more frequently referred to in literature\r\nby the French form of his name, “Jean de Vigo”--was born at Rapallo,\r\nnear Genoa, Italy, about the year 1460. He was the son of Bernardo di\r\nRapallo, who was also a surgeon; and he himself was the founder of a\r\nschool which sent out quite a number of practical surgeons. In 1485 he\r\nbegan the practice of his profession at Saluzzo, a small town about\r\nforty miles south of Turin; and ten years later he settled at Savona,\r\nwhich is located on the Mediterranean, a short distance to the west\r\nof Genoa. In 1503 he was chosen the personal physician of Cardinal\r\nGiuliano della Rovere, who resided at Savona, and he continued to hold\r\nthis position after the cardinal was elected to the papal office under\r\nthe name of Julius the Second.\r\n\r\nDa Vigo’s great treatise on surgery (“_Practica in arte chirurgica\r\ncopiosa continens novem libros_,” Rome, 1514) owed its celebrity,\r\nduring the early part of the sixteenth century, chiefly to the fact\r\nthat he was the first author to write somewhat thoroughly upon syphilis\r\nand upon gunshot wounds--two surgical disorders of great importance\r\nat that time. As to gunshot wounds, da Vigo was one of the first to\r\nmaintain that they were poisoned wounds; and for a long time afterward\r\nthis was the generally accepted opinion. Like all his contemporaries,\r\nda Vigo was not willing to undertake such operations as those for the\r\ncure of stone in the bladder, for the relief of cataract, and for the\r\ncure of hernia. He left these, says Haeser, to the itinerant surgeons.\r\nBut he gained well-merited credit by his employment of ligatures for\r\nthe arrest of bleeding in a variety of conditions--not, however,\r\nin amputations, as he appears to have avoided cutting operations.\r\nAccording to the same authority, the circular pattern of trephine (the\r\nkind which the surgeons of the present day prefer) was first introduced\r\nby da Vigo. The following passage copied from his “_Practica_”\r\nshows that he was familiar with the use of the ear speculum: “...\r\n_si ad solem speculo instrumento aure ampliata_.” Da Vigo died\r\nsoon after 1517.\r\n\r\nBartolommeo Maggi, who was born at Bologna either in 1477 (Haeser)\r\nor in 1516 (von Gurlt), held the Chair of Anatomy and Surgery in the\r\nmedical school of his native city, and then at a later date accepted\r\nthe position of private physician to Pope Julius the Third (1550–1555).\r\nHe held this position, however, only for a short time, as he found that\r\nthe climate of Rome did not agree with him. His posthumous fame rests\r\nlargely on the treatise which he wrote on gunshot wounds and which\r\nwas published by his brother a short time after the former’s death.\r\nHis treatise, says von Gurlt, is one of the best of those which were\r\npublished on this subject during the sixteenth century. Henry the\r\nSecond, King of France, expressed his gratitude to Maggi for the care\r\nwhich he took of the wounded French soldiers who fell into the hands of\r\nthe papal troops at the sieges of Parma and Mirandola. Maggi maintained\r\nfirmly the belief that gunshot wounds are either poisoned or burned.\r\nHis death occurred in 1552. The title of his treatise on gunshot wounds\r\nis: “_De vulnerum bombardarum etc._,” Bologna, 1552.\r\n\r\nMarianus Sanctus of Barletta near Naples (born in 1489, died at some\r\nunknown date after 1550) is credited with having been the first to\r\npublish a description of the so-called “_apparatus magnus_”--the\r\nname given in those early days to the method of extracting a calculus\r\nfrom the urinary bladder through an incision in the perineum after a\r\ngrooved sound or director had first been passed into this organ by\r\nway of the urethra. The title of the book in which this description\r\nis given is the following: “_De lapide renum liber et de lapide ex\r\nvesica per incisionem extrahendo_,” Venice, 1535. Marianus, however,\r\ndoes not claim to have been the inventor of this method. Some writers\r\ngive the credit for this to Jean da Vigo’s father, Bernardo di Rapallo,\r\nwho communicated a knowledge of the method to Giovanni de Romanis,\r\nwho in turn instructed Marianus Sanctus. It is believed, furthermore,\r\nby some writers that Giovanni de Romanis was the inventor of\r\nlithontripsy[86]--the operation of crushing a stone in the bladder or\r\nurethra. Laurent Colot, the famous French lithotomist of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, obtained his knowledge from a certain Octavianus de Villa, a\r\nfriend of Marianus Sanctus, and then kept the matter secret for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nFallopius, the famous anatomist of the early part of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, does not appear to have attained equal distinction in the\r\nfield of surgery. So far as one may judge from the portions of the\r\ntext selected from his writings by von Gurlt, Fallopius was a very\r\nconservative if not a very timid surgeon, in this respect being not\r\nunlike Fabricius ab Acquapendente. In the text to which reference has\r\njust been made, I find a brief mention of a case which passed under\r\nFallopius’ observation and which, perhaps, is of sufficient interest\r\nto be recorded here. The patient’s--a German student’s--finger had\r\nbeen nearly severed by some cutting instrument, and the greater part\r\nof the member remained attached to the hand only by a narrow strip of\r\nflesh. “I stitched together the separated edges, and at the end of\r\nthree or four days I was astonished to find that firm union between the\r\nseparated parts had already taken place. This result seemed to me like\r\nsomething miraculous.”\r\n\r\nCarcano Leone was born at Milan in 1536, his parents being people of\r\ngood social standing. After receiving a thorough classical education,\r\nhe began his medical studies in his native city, under the guidance\r\nof Pietro Martire, a pupil of Vesalius. He next continued his studies\r\nat the University of Pavia, but eventually went to Padua, where he\r\nenrolled himself among the pupils of Fallopius. After a residence of\r\ntwo years in that city, he returned to Milan and opened a medical\r\nschool of his own. Upon the occasion of the death of the Cardinal and\r\nArchbishop Carlo Borromeo, whose remains now rest in the cathedral of\r\nMilan, it was Carcano Leone who was invited to make the postmortem\r\nexamination. He carried on the practice of his profession during a\r\nperiod of about twenty-eight years, his death occurring--so far as may\r\nnow be learned--in 1606.\r\n\r\nCarcano Leone’s reputation as a surgeon rests mainly on the treatise\r\nwhich he wrote on the wounds of the head, and which was published at\r\nMilan in 1583. From among the numerous cases of this character which\r\ncame under his observation, and of which a certain number are reported\r\nby von Gurlt, I have selected the very brief histories of three that\r\nseem to me well adapted to serve as examples of Leone’s knowledge of\r\nsurgery and also of his ability to cope with problems of so serious\r\na character. They reveal the fact that he was a surgeon of excellent\r\njudgment, most persevering, and very resourceful. Briefly told, the\r\naccounts of the three cases to which I have referred read as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Case I.--A small boy was hit on the right temple by a stone\r\n   that had been thrown by one of his companions. Unconsciousness\r\n   resulted and lasted for six days. On the seventh day signs of\r\n   returning consciousness manifested themselves, but inability to\r\n   speak persisted. By the end of another week the boy had already\r\n   made some efforts to speak, but his speech was incomprehensible.\r\n   After the twentieth day it was possible to understand a little\r\n   of what the boy was trying to say; and from this time onward\r\n   steady improvement in this respect was recognizable from day\r\n   to day; but the boy’s speech did not become quite normal until\r\n   after the lapse of about a year.\r\n\r\n   When Carcano Leone was called to see the patient he found that\r\n   the entire temporal muscle had been crushed and that almost the\r\n   entire right side of the head was occupied by a fluctuating\r\n   swelling. By making a free incision in the swelling Leone gave\r\n   exit to a large quantity of black coagulated blood. On the\r\n   following day, when he made an examination with the probe, he\r\n   found that the entire squamous portion of the temporal bone was\r\n   in a fractured state, one part of it overriding the rest. By the\r\n   aid of elevators he succeeded in lifting up the depressed part\r\n   of the bone, but the accomplishment of this result left a large\r\n   gap between the opposite edges of the fragments, and through\r\n   this opening one could see the movements of the dura mater.\r\n   Complete healing took place only after the lapse of twelve\r\n   months.\r\n\r\n   When Leone reported the case to his former teacher, Fallopius,\r\n   the latter replied that he would not have had the courage to\r\n   adopt the course which his former pupil had pursued.\r\n\r\n   Case II.--In another case the patient, a full-grown man, was\r\n   struck on the right temple by a highwayman with a heavy cane\r\n   which broke in two in the middle under the great force which\r\n   the assailant had employed. He was left lying on the roadside\r\n   in a state of unconsciousness until some passers-by discovered\r\n   him and carried him to his home. He remained unconscious for\r\n   several days. Before the physician was summoned all sorts of\r\n   measures had been resorted to for the purpose of dissipating the\r\n   swelling in the temporal region, but without success. Leone, on\r\n   arriving upon the scene, made a free incision which afforded\r\n   escape to a large quantity of decomposing blood that appeared to\r\n   be collected, not between the muscle and the skin, but between\r\n   the muscle and the bone. The latter was found to be fractured\r\n   transversely and depressed; and, in order to lift it back to\r\n   its proper level, it became necessary first to incise the\r\n   muscle transversely. At the end of three months the wound had\r\n   completely healed and the patient had regained his health.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the cases just narrated and of others of a similar nature,\r\nLeone remarks that he has never had any experience that would justify\r\nthe fear expressed by Hippocrates that convulsions are likely to result\r\nfrom dividing the temporal muscle.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the value of trephining the skull in cases of injury\r\nto the head, Leone narrates the following experience:--\r\n\r\n   Case III.--A man was struck by a heavy stone on the upper part\r\n   of the forehead close to where the hair grows, and was thrown\r\n   to the ground by the force of the blow. Here he lay as if dead.\r\n   When Leone was called, a short time afterward, to see the\r\n   patient he found the skin unbroken except at one small spot,\r\n   and from this point he made an incision of such length that he\r\n   was thereby enabled to explore the surface of the skull. In\r\n   this way he discovered that there was a fracture which appeared\r\n   to extend through the entire thickness of the skull. He then,\r\n   without further delay, trephined the cranium over the line\r\n   of the fracture. This was followed by such a copious flow of\r\n   blood that Leone was obliged to adopt measures for arresting\r\n   any further hemorrhage. During the following fourteen days (the\r\n   summer season then being at its height) large quantities of\r\n   decomposed and evil-smelling blood escaped from the wound; but\r\n   the dura mater gradually assumed a more natural appearance, many\r\n   splinters of bone were ejected, and finally--at the end of forty\r\n   days--the wound healed. (As no further details are given in the\r\n   text, it is fair to assume that there were no sequelae of an\r\n   unfavorable nature.)\r\n\r\nThe whole subject of injuries to the skull is treated in a most\r\nthorough manner by Leone, and the book is pronounced by Scarpa\r\n(1752–1832), the famous anatomist, the best that, up to his time, had\r\nbeen written on the subject. The three histories of cases which I have\r\nhere reproduced and which furnish such striking proof of what surgery\r\nmay accomplish when practiced by a man of good courage as well as of\r\ngood judgment, certainly justify the favorable opinion expressed by\r\nScarpa upon Leone’s work.\r\n\r\nFabricius ab Acquapendente, of whom I have already given some account\r\non a previous page, was distinguished not only as an anatomist and as a\r\nphysiologist, but also--which was true of his instructor, Fallopius--as\r\na surgeon. From his published writings, however, it appears very\r\nclearly that, like Fallopius, he had a decided aversion to the use\r\nof the knife; his activities as a surgeon being restricted largely\r\nto the improvement of certain of the more bloodless operations (for\r\nexample, tracheotomy and thoracentesis and operations for the relief\r\nof stricture of the urethra). He also invented several new surgical\r\ninstruments and devised a number of machines for use in orthopaedic\r\npractice. He attached great value to the teachings of Celsus and Paulus\r\nAegineta, his writings containing frequent and copious references\r\nto these authorities and relatively few data based upon his own\r\nexperience. In the section which he devotes to the subject of wounds of\r\nthe abdomen, Fabricius confirms the opinion very generally held by the\r\nancients, viz., that a wound of the small intestine is invariably fatal.\r\n\r\nGaspare Tagliacozzi was born at Bologna in 1546. He studied medicine\r\nunder Girolamo Cardano, Professor of Medicine, first at Pavia and\r\nafterward at Bologna, and received his degree (“Doctor of Philosophy\r\nand Medicine”) in 1570. Very soon afterward he began teaching surgery,\r\nand a little later he also taught anatomy and the theoretical part of\r\nmedicine. In this work he was so successful that in 1576 he was made\r\na member of the Faculty. He died on November 7, 1599, at the age of\r\nfifty-three.\r\n\r\nThe Italian method of performing plastic operations, says von Gurlt,\r\nhad already flourished for about one hundred and fifty years before\r\nTagliacozzi took up the subject in serious earnest and attained results\r\nof decided scientific value. There are some doubts, however, as to the\r\nprecise degree of credit that should be awarded Tagliacozzi for his\r\nshare in the development of the operation which bears his name. The\r\nfacts which throw some light upon this question may be stated in the\r\nfollowing paragraphs:--\r\n\r\n   (1.) Tagliacozzi’s Latin is not easy to understand, and he\r\n   certainly does not furnish satisfactory information as to the\r\n   manner in which he learned the details of the operation which we\r\n   are here considering. Vesalius, Paré and other surgical authors\r\n   of that period throw no light upon that question and furnish\r\n   erroneous descriptions of the steps of the operation. Apparently\r\n   they had never witnessed one of that character. (Von Gurlt.)\r\n\r\n   (2.) The records seem to warrant the statement that, about\r\n   the middle of the fifteenth century a surgeon by the name of\r\n   Branca, who lived in the city of Catania on the southeast coast\r\n   of Sicily, devoted himself largely to the reconstruction of\r\n   damaged or defective noses. At first he transplanted a flap from\r\n   the forehead or cheek; but afterward his son sought to improve\r\n   the method by utilizing a flap of skin taken from the arm. By\r\n   this plan the disfiguring of the patient’s face was avoided.\r\n   The son employed the same method in repairing the lips and the\r\n   ears. Pupils of the latter carried a knowledge of the method to\r\n   the Bojano (Vianea or Vieneo) family in Tropea, Calabria, and\r\n   from them it was transmitted, about the middle of the sixteenth\r\n   century, to Tagliacozzi and eventually to the medical profession\r\n   in every part of the world.\r\n\r\n   (3.) In 1581 there was published at Cracow, Galicia (formerly\r\n   Poland), a book which bore the title “Przymiot” and which gave\r\n   a most complete account of the disease syphilis in all its\r\n   manifestations and complications. This book, in its original\r\n   form, is to-day one of the greatest bibliographical rarities;\r\n   but a reprint of the work was published in 1881 by the Warsaw\r\n   Surgical Society. In this volume Wojciech Oczko, the personal\r\n   physician and secretary of the Polish kings Stephan Bathory and\r\n   Sigismund the Third, discusses other surgical topics beside\r\n   syphilis. He states, for example, that Aranzio (or Arantius),\r\n   who was Professor of Surgery at Bologna at the time (1569) when\r\n   he frequented that medical school, was successful in making a\r\n   new nose by transplanting a flap of skin from the patient’s\r\n   arm; and that he performed this operation without injuring the\r\n   muscles of the arm, and also with perfect success as regards\r\n   the creation of a straight and shapely nose. “This statement,”\r\n   says von Gurlt, “coming as it does from an eye-witness who was\r\n   at Bologna several years before Tagliacozzi’s time, furnishes\r\n   satisfactory proof that rhinoplasty was successfully performed\r\n   in that city several years before the date of publication\r\n   (1586) of Tagliacozzi’s earliest comments on the subject,\r\n   and that the credit for first bringing the operation to the\r\n   knowledge of European surgeons is due to Aranzio rather than\r\n   to Tagliacozzi.” The latter’s famous treatise on rhinoplasty\r\n   (“_De chirurgia curtorum per insitionem_”) was published at\r\n   Venice in 1597.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 21. THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SO-CALLED\r\n  TAGLIACOTIAN OPERATION FOR REPAIRING A DEFECTIVE NOSE SHOULD BE\r\n  CARRIED OUT.\r\n\r\n  (From the treatise published by Tagliacozzi, Venice, 1597.)]\r\n\r\n   (4.) Fabricius of Hilden, the distinguished German surgeon\r\n   of the sixteenth century, assures us that his teacher, Jean\r\n   Griffon, at that time the leading surgeon of Lausanne (but, at\r\n   an earlier period, of Geneva), performed the same operation in\r\n   1592. The patient was a young Genevese woman whose nose had been\r\n   cut off by some soldiers belonging to the army of the Duke of\r\n   Savoy who were enraged at the resistance which she offered to\r\n   their familiarities; and the operation proved most successful,\r\n   “the new nose eliciting the admiration of all who saw it.”\r\n   Fabricius adds that during the winter seasons, up to the year\r\n   1613, the tip of this nose presented a somewhat purplish hue.\r\n   The woman married in 1603.\r\n\r\n   (5.) During the short lifetime of Tagliacozzi several tablets,\r\n   on which laudatory inscriptions were engraved, were erected in\r\n   the high school (_archiginasio_) of Bologna, and after his\r\n   death a bust that represented him holding a nose in his hand was\r\n   erected in the same building. Corradi, the medical historian\r\n   (1833–1892), writes that in his time both bust and tablets had\r\n   disappeared. Tagliacozzi’s remains were temporarily lodged in\r\n   the cloisters of the church of San Giovanni Battista, and the\r\n   report was circulated that, a few weeks after his death, a\r\n   voice was heard saying that he was among the damned. Thereupon\r\n   the remains were removed to the walls of the city, and the\r\n   Tagliacotian method was soon forgotten, to be revived only after\r\n   the lapse of many years.\r\n\r\nAll the data which I have reproduced in the preceding paragraphs\r\nseem to point to the conclusion suggested by von Gurlt, viz., that\r\nTagliacozzi was willing to accept for himself a credit which belonged\r\nin reality to another, and that there would be more justice in calling\r\nthe famous rhinoplastic method of procedure “the Arantian operation”\r\nthan the Tagliacotian; especially as our knowledge of the method\r\nadopted by the younger Branca is entirely too vague to justify us in\r\nbestowing this honor upon him.\r\n\r\nGiulio Cesare Aranzio (or Arantius) was born at Bologna about the year\r\n1530. He studied medicine first in his native city, under the guidance\r\nof his uncle, Bartolommeo Maggi, and then afterward went to Padua,\r\nwhere he may possibly have been one of Vesalius’ pupils. In 1548 he\r\nmade, at Padua, his first anatomical discovery--that of the _musculus\r\nlevator palpebrae superioris_. Before he was twenty-seven years\r\nold he was chosen Professor of Medicine, Surgery and Anatomy in the\r\nUniversity of Bologna, and he filled the position with distinction up\r\nto the time of his death on April 7, 1589--_i.e._, during a period\r\nof thirty-three years.\r\n\r\nThe part taken by Aranzio in the advancement of surgery was apparently\r\nof small importance. He succeeded, it is true (see remarks on page\r\n479), in reviving the interest of contemporary surgeons in the\r\npossibility of restoring damaged parts of the human face by means\r\nof flaps taken from the patient’s arm. But I have not been able\r\nto discover that he made any other material contributions to this\r\ndepartment of the science of medicine. It is possible, however, that\r\nhis plan of illuminating the interior of the nose and of operating upon\r\nnasal polypi may possess some measure of originality; but I do not\r\nfeel competent to decide this question. As regards the procedure just\r\nreferred to, it may be stated briefly that Aranzio was in the habit,\r\nwhen operating within the nasal cavity, of using by preference, for\r\nilluminating purposes, the direct rays of the sun, which were allowed\r\nto enter the room through a slit or hole in the wooden window blind;\r\nand, when sunlight was not available, he used as a source of light\r\nthe rays emanating from a lighted wax candle. In the latter case he\r\nincreased the brilliancy of the illumination by interposing between the\r\nflame of the candle and the illuminated field, a glass globe filled\r\nwith water,--an idea which probably originated with the goldsmiths or\r\nthe shoemakers. The employment of light reflected from a concave mirror\r\nsupplanted this method somewhere about the year 1866.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, during the sixteenth century, there were several\r\nsurgeons--uneducated empirics--who contributed not a little to our\r\nknowledge of the radical cure of hernia; and of this number the\r\nmembers of the Norsa family (from Norsa, a small town in the district\r\nof Naples) were undoubtedly the best known and most experienced\r\noperators. Horazio Norsa, for example, is reputed to have performed the\r\nradical operation (in combination with castration) no less than two\r\nhundred times. It was this same Horazio Norsa who, in the latter part\r\nof his career, complained to Fabricius ab Acquapendente that, since the\r\nwearing of trusses had become so common a custom as it then was, the\r\nnumber of operations for the cure of hernia had greatly diminished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF SURGERY IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL DURING THE RENAISSANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the authority of Morejon, who published (1842–1852) an\r\nelaborate history of medicine in Spain and Portugal, these countries\r\nalmost rivaled Italy, during the sixteenth century, in the number and\r\nexcellence of their physicians. But, so far as I am able to judge\r\nfrom the record, very few of these men appear to have taken a strong\r\ninterest in surgery, and of these few there are only three--Daza\r\nChacon, Francisco Arceo and Amatus Lusitanus--who left behind them\r\ntreatises which seem to call for a brief notice.\r\n\r\nDionisio Daza Chacon, who was born in 1503 at Valladolid, about one\r\nhundred miles north of Madrid, received his early training partly in\r\nhis native city and partly at the University of Salamanca. After being\r\nengaged for some time in private practice he joined the imperial army\r\n(Charles the Fifth) in the capacity of a field surgeon in charge of a\r\ncorps of three thousand men. In addition to these troops there were\r\nsix thousand English archers, in the pay of the Emperor. At the two\r\nsieges in which these men participated--the siege of Landrecy in 1543\r\nand that of Saint Dizier in 1544--Daza Chacon acquired an extensive\r\nexperience in the treatment of both arrow and gunshot wounds, for the\r\nnumber of those injured on those occasions was very great. In 1545,\r\nafter he had been chosen personal physician of Charles the Fifth, he\r\nreturned home by way of Madrid, and distinguished himself greatly in\r\n1547 by his self-sacrificing attendance upon the victims of the Plague\r\nin his native city. In 1557 he offered himself as a candidate for the\r\nposition of Surgeon-in-Chief of the hospital at Valladolid, and, after\r\npassing with great credit the competitive examination, he was given the\r\nappointment. During the following six years he served that institution\r\nwith conspicuous ability, and then accepted the position of private\r\nphysician to Prince Don Carlos, the son of Philip the Second, King of\r\nSpain. Four years later he entered the service of Don Juan of Austria\r\n(the natural brother of Philip the Second), and accompanied this prince\r\non his sea voyages to various parts of the Mediterranean; being with\r\nhim, for example, on the occasion of the bloody sea fight in the Gulf\r\nof Lepanto in 1571. On reaching the age of seventy, Daza Chacon retired\r\nfrom active practice and devoted himself to the writing of his great\r\nwork on surgery--“_Practica y teorica de cirujia, en Romance y en\r\nLatin_,” Valladolid, 1600; and several later editions. The date\r\nof Chacon’s death is not known, but it certainly occurred before the\r\npublication of his book.\r\n\r\nVon Gurlt says that Chacon’s treatise is distinguished by the\r\nsystematic and clear manner in which the author treats the subjects\r\nwith which he deals, and it shows him to be well versed in the\r\nteachings of other writers on surgery, that he is ready at all times\r\nto give them full credit for any contributions which they may have\r\nmade to this branch of medicine, and that he is remarkably free from\r\nthe superstitiousness which was so prevalent in his day. Of all the\r\ntreatises on surgery which have been written by Spaniards, either\r\nduring the sixteenth century or at a more recent date, this work, says\r\nvon Gurlt, is unquestionably the best.\r\n\r\nThe edition of the treatise published at Madrid in 1626 contains 922\r\npages--a large work. Among the reports of cases published in Part II.,\r\nthere are several which possess features of considerable interest, but\r\nI shall be able to reproduce only one of them here:--\r\n\r\n   The young prince, Don Carlos, aged seventeen, while residing\r\n   temporarily at Alcalá de Henares, plunged head foremost, in\r\n   the dark, down a steep staircase and struck his head against a\r\n   closed door. When the lad was picked up it was found that, at\r\n   the back of his head, there was an open wound about the size of\r\n   a man’s thumbnail, that the surrounding scalp showed evidences\r\n   of being bruised, and that the pericranium in this region\r\n   had been laid bare. During the first three days following the\r\n   accident the patient manifested only a moderate degree of fever,\r\n   but on the fourth day the fever became more pronounced. The\r\n   wound, which by this time was discharging actively, presented at\r\n   first a healthy appearance, but it soon acquired an unhealthy\r\n   aspect, and the patient began to complain of numbness in the\r\n   right leg. Vesalius, the private physician of Charles the Fifth,\r\n   the boy’s grandfather, was one of the many physicians who were\r\n   called in to consult about the treatment of this case; he was\r\n   sent for on the eleventh day following the accident. On the\r\n   seventeenth day the wound was enlarged and the bone carefully\r\n   examined, but no evidence of a fracture or a fissure was\r\n   discovered. On the following day erysipelas manifested itself on\r\n   the head and neck and extended downward until it had involved\r\n   both arms. At the same time the fever increased very markedly,\r\n   and for five days the patient was delirious. As by this time\r\n   there was ample reason for suspecting that some intracranial\r\n   injury had occurred, it was decided to trephine the skull. The\r\n   operation was performed on the twenty-first day, but nothing of\r\n   importance was discovered. The patient’s life was now evidently\r\n   in great peril, and an unfavorable prognosis was pronounced.\r\n   Four days later, however, complete consciousness returned.\r\n   On the twenty-ninth day a quantity of pus was evacuated from\r\n   the very much swollen eyelids; and, three days later still,\r\n   the patient was found to be quite free from fever. On the\r\n   forty-sixth day he left his bed for the first time, and at the\r\n   end of ninety-three days the wound was found to have firmly\r\n   cicatrized.\r\n\r\n   [Some interesting details concerning the subsequent life of Don\r\n   Carlos will be found in Motley’s “Rise of the Dutch Republic.”\r\n   They suggest the possibility that his attacks of violent temper\r\n   may have resulted from the lesions produced by the accident\r\n   narrated above.]\r\n\r\nFrancisco Arceo was born, about the year 1493, at Fregenal in the\r\nProvince of Badajoz, Spain. It is not known at what university or other\r\neducational institution he received his early training in the science\r\nof medicine. It is a well-established fact, however, that at quite an\r\nearly stage of his professional career he acquired great celebrity for\r\nhis skill in treating both surgical and internal maladies, and that,\r\nas a consequence, patients flocked in large numbers from all parts of\r\nSpain to consult him. Rather late in life he wrote two treatises--one\r\non the treatment of wounds, as well as on ulcers and syphilis, and\r\nanother on the management of fevers. These two works were published at\r\nAntwerp, in the year 1574, as a single volume, the author being at that\r\ntime, despite his advanced age (eighty), still in vigorous health and\r\nable to practice with skill both branches of the science of medicine.\r\nIn 1658 a second edition of Arceo’s two treatises was published\r\nat Amsterdam; and even at an earlier date there were published an\r\nEnglish translation (1588) and a German version (1614). A perusal of\r\nthe chapter which he devotes to the treatment of clubfoot gives the\r\nimpression that Arceo was an excellent surgeon--eminently practical\r\nin his choice of means for securing certain results, and thoroughly\r\nfamiliar with the extent to which he might depend upon the powers of\r\nNature to aid his efforts. The date of his death is not known.\r\n\r\nAmatus Lusitanus is the name by which the Portuguese medical writer,\r\nJuan Rodriguez de Castel Bianco, is commonly known. He was born in the\r\nProvince of Beira, Portugal, in 1511, of Jewish parents, and studied\r\nmedicine at the University of Salamanca. After doing duty as a surgeon\r\nin two of the hospitals of that city, he took up his residence, for\r\nshort periods of time, first in Antwerp and then in Ragusa, Dalmatia,\r\non the eastern coast of the Adriatic. At this period of our history\r\nthe Inquisition was extremely active throughout the domains that were\r\nunder the rule of Charles the Fifth, and as a result Amatus soon\r\nfound himself obliged to abandon all his books, instruments, etc.,\r\nand flee for his life to Northern Greece. As the Turks, who were in\r\npossession of that country, were perfectly indifferent with regard to\r\nthe religious beliefs of the Jews, Amatus was allowed to settle down\r\nquietly for the rest of his life at Thessalonica, in Macedonia.\r\n\r\nDuring the later years of his career he published several books on\r\ntopics relating to the science of medicine--two of them on materia\r\nmedica and two on the cases of special interest which had come under\r\nhis personal observation during the course of his practice. The\r\nlatter work, which is entitled “_Curationum medicinalium centuriae\r\nVII._,”[87] was printed in its entirety in Venice, in 1556 (2\r\nvols.). Von Gurlt speaks of Amatus as a cultivated scholar and an\r\nexcellent observer. Of the seven hundred cases reported in this work\r\nonly a very few are of interest to the surgeon. Von Gurlt calls\r\nattention to the fact that, during the earlier years of his practice,\r\nAmatus devoted a fair share of his attention to surgery, but that\r\nsubsequently he performed no operations whatever; it being his rule to\r\nintrust this work entirely to a regular surgeon or to a specialist.\r\n\r\nIn my search among the dozen or more histories of cases selected by\r\nvon Gurlt from the seven “Centuries” (700) of the complete treatise\r\nas suitably illustrating Amatus’ manner of reporting the cases which\r\nhe had seen in practice, the various methods of treatment which he\r\nadopted in his efforts to relieve the diseases or injuries that came\r\nunder his observation, and the demeanor of the man in the presence of\r\nthe ever-changing problems presented to the physician, I have succeeded\r\nin finding only four that seem to furnish in even a slight degree the\r\ninformation which I have just outlined. Unsatisfactory as these four\r\nreports are in certain respects,--especially in their failure to reveal\r\nto us the more strictly surgical capabilities of Amatus,--they at least\r\nshow that he was an able and conscientious practitioner, and to this\r\nextent they possess value.\r\n\r\n   The first case reported in Century I. is that of a peasant girl,\r\n   aged thirteen, who, while walking barefooted in a field was\r\n   bitten by a viper. Amatus did not see the patient until three\r\n   hours later, but already at this early stage he observed many\r\n   blue and red patches, scattered over the leg and thigh of the\r\n   side on which the bite had been inflicted. Near the base of\r\n   the foot there were two quite black spots corresponding to the\r\n   bites of the reptile; and from the fact that there were only two\r\n   such spots Amatus inferred that the snake must have been a male\r\n   viper, which has only two poison fangs and is therefore less\r\n   dangerous than the female which has four. The symptoms which\r\n   the girl experienced were faintness, trembling and dizziness.\r\n   As regards the treatment adopted, the skin in the immediate\r\n   neighborhood of the bites was scarified and suction by the means\r\n   of cupping glasses was employed; afterward a plaster, which was\r\n   composed in part of theriaca, was applied to this region. The\r\n   patient made a complete recovery.\r\n\r\n   In Century V., Amatus gives an account of a fatal case of ear\r\n   disease. The patient, a sickly-looking boy of eight who had\r\n   been affected for a long time with a discharge from one ear,\r\n   presented a non-sensitive lump on the side of the head. “As he\r\n   began to show signs of feverishness it was decided to incise the\r\n   lump; and when the incision had been made, it was found that a\r\n   large part of the skull in this region had been destroyed by\r\n   caries, as a result of which there was left a cavity in the side\r\n   of the head, and this cavity was filled with a foul-smelling\r\n   pus, débris, and granulation tissue that apparently rested on\r\n   the dura mater. Three days later the surgeon[88] succeeded in\r\n   removing from the cavity only a small quantity of the sanious\r\n   material. On the fourth day, after an attack of convulsions, the\r\n   patient died.”\r\n\r\n   In Century VII. there is given an account of a man of the\r\n   wealthy class who had been exposed to an excessive degree of\r\n   cold for so long a time that he was literally almost half\r\n   frozen. “As he was being carried into the village he gave orders\r\n   that an ox should be slaughtered and that he himself should be\r\n   snugly stowed away inside the carcass of the animal as soon\r\n   as its interior furnishings had been removed. Thus he escaped\r\n   freezing to death.”\r\n\r\n   In the same century Amatus speaks of having seen a rather\r\n   interesting case of _Filaria Medinensis_ (called by the\r\n   Arabs “_vena medena_”) in a negro boy, eighteen years old,\r\n   who had come to Thessalonica from Memphis, Egypt. “The worm\r\n   had caused the production of an ulcer close to the boy’s heel,\r\n   and in this the creature’s head, which looked very much like a\r\n   vein, was recognizable. After the Turks had correctly diagnosed\r\n   the nature of the trouble an Arabian physician, who had managed\r\n   to secure a purchase on the worm, began rolling it up on a\r\n   small stick. Gradually, after the lapse of several days, he\r\n   succeeded in uncoiling the animal in its entire length (three\r\n   cubits), as shown by the construction of the end of the tail,\r\n   and thus permanently freed the boy from his trouble. The ancient\r\n   authors express doubts as to the true nature of the object found\r\n   in these ulcers, but I, Amatus, having examined the slender\r\n   white creature and having witnessed its curved outlines as it\r\n   projected itself outside the opening, do vouch for the fact that\r\n   it possesses all the characteristics of a true worm.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\n THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURGERY IN FRANCE DURING THE RENAISSANCE.--PIERRE\r\n                                FRANCO\r\n\r\n\r\nVon Gurlt speaks of Pierre Franco as “one of the most skilful surgeons\r\nand at the same time one of the most original medical writers of the\r\nsixteenth century.” He and his contemporary, Ambroise Paré, were\r\nof French birth, and to France therefore belongs the conspicuous\r\ndistinction of having contributed to medical science during the\r\nRenaissance two of its most illuminating and efficient laborers. These\r\nmen, who were the leading operative surgeons in France during the\r\nfirst half of the sixteenth century, did not owe their education as\r\nphysicians to the official training provided by the Medical Faculty,\r\nbut partly to the men who were classed as barbers and surgeons, or\r\nbarber-surgeons (_Collège de St. Côme_), and still more to\r\ntheir own efforts. They gathered practical knowledge wherever they\r\nmight--largely from their official connection with armies during the\r\nprogress of different wars. Further details with regard to their\r\npersonal characters and the principal events of their professional\r\ncareers will be furnished in the following brief sketches.\r\n\r\n_Pierre Franco._--Pierre Franco was born in the village of\r\nTurriers, in Provence (now the Department of Basses-Alpes), about\r\nthe year 1500. He received his instruction in surgery from itinerant\r\nlithotomists, operators for cataract, hernia-healers and men of\r\nthat class; and it is quite likely that, in the early days of his\r\nprofessional career in Provence, he was himself a practitioner of this\r\nhumble type. At a somewhat later date he left the southern part of\r\nFrance and took up his residence in Switzerland, first at Berne and\r\nthen at Lausanne. He probably left Provence because, in the early\r\npart of the sixteenth century, the Protestants of that region were\r\nbeing subjected to every form of persecution; and it is almost certain\r\nthat Franco belonged then to the Reformed Church, for he accepted the\r\nsalaried office of City Surgeon at Berne, the authorities of which city\r\nwere bitterly opposed to everybody and everything connected with the\r\nRoman Catholic Church. Franco held the office named during a period\r\nof ten years, the first part of the time at Berne, and afterward at\r\nLausanne, which latter city was then under the control of the Bernese\r\nGovernment. He was a very close observer, a most enthusiastic student\r\nof his art, and a man of intensely religious nature. Malgaigne, the\r\ndistinguished editor of the modern edition of Paré’s writings, speaks\r\nthus of Franco: “I have no intention of writing here the history of\r\nthis man who was endowed with such a fine surgical genius; I may say,\r\nhowever, that his was a life devoted entirely to the advancement of\r\nsurgery as a science.”\r\n\r\nAs an operative surgeon, says Edouard Nicaise, Franco ranked higher\r\nthan any of his contemporaries. Strange as it may appear, Ambroise Paré\r\nfrequently refused to take charge of cases in which an operation for\r\nstone in the bladder, for hernia, or for cataract was required, whereas\r\nFranco owed much of his reputation to the success which he had in\r\noperating upon these three classes of cases. The latter, furthermore,\r\ndid most of his work on patients who belonged to the middle class, and\r\nconsequently his operations were characterized by very little of the\r\néclat which marked a large part of the work done by Paré, who from the\r\nvery beginning was befriended by Royalty and the Court circle. At the\r\nsame time, says Nicaise, Franco did more than any other man of that\r\nperiod to enrich surgery with new discoveries.\r\n\r\nFranco has written only two treatises. The first one, which was\r\npublished in Lyons, France, in 1556, bears the title: “A Small\r\nTreatise on the Operative Treatment of Hernia”--one of the most\r\nimportant departments of surgery (a book of 144 pages, 8vo). The second\r\nwork, which was issued in 1561, also at Lyons but by a different\r\npublisher, bears the title: “_Traité des hernies contenant une\r\nample déclaration de toutes leurs espèces, etc._” (a book of 554\r\npages, 8vo). This work goes very thoroughly into the subject of hernia\r\nin all its bearings, and also deals with several other important\r\nsurgical topics, such as genito-urinary diseases (in both the male\r\nand the female), affections of the eyes, hare-lip, tumors, wounds in\r\ngeneral, dislocations, fractures, amputations, etc.; in short, it is\r\na fairly complete and decidedly original treatise on general surgery.\r\nWhen Franco wrote the smaller work (that of 1556), he was settled at\r\nLausanne; but in 1561 he was living in Orange, which at that time was\r\nthe capital of a Principality that belonged to the House of Nassau.[89]\r\nA few brief citations from the larger of the two treatises will suffice\r\nto give our readers some idea of the manner in which Franco deals with\r\nthe subject-matter of the book.\r\n\r\nFranco, says von Gurlt, was one of the first surgeons--perhaps the\r\nvery first--to perform the operation required for the relief of\r\nstrangulated hernia and at the same time to furnish a description of\r\nthe manner in which it should be performed. After mentioning the fact\r\nthat the strangulation of a portion of the intestine is attended with\r\nconsiderable danger to the patient’s life, Franco proceeds to consider\r\nthe subject in greater detail:--\r\n\r\n   Owing to the large amount of the fecal matter and gas contained\r\n   within the portion of the intestine that is imprisoned in\r\n   the scrotum, and also owing to the inflamed condition of\r\n   the parts, it is frequently not possible to push the bowel\r\n   back through the narrow aperture in the peritoneum; and this\r\n   condition of things is apt to be aggravated by the constipation\r\n   or by the efforts at vomiting that frequently accompany such\r\n   strangulation. The vomiting, it is true, may in certain cases\r\n   facilitate the desired reduction, but in others it does harm,\r\n   especially by forcing more fecal matter into the scrotum. If\r\n   the conditions described are permitted to continue unrelieved,\r\n   death may certainly be expected to result. In a few cases the\r\n   timely administration of medicine internally may overcome the\r\n   difficulty, but, if this measure fail to produce the desired\r\n   result, recourse must be had to surgery--not, however, if\r\n   already the scrotum and neighboring genital parts have changed\r\n   their color to a black, livid, bluish or some other unnatural\r\n   hue, or if the hernial tumor manifest a round rather than an\r\n   elongated shape, for all these signs are harbingers of death;\r\n   and, as further unfavorable signs, should be reckoned a livid\r\n   or black mucous membrane of the patient’s mouth, contracted\r\n   nostrils, and an appreciably sunken condition of the eyes. But\r\n   if, on the other hand, the scrotum possess a natural color and\r\n   if it have not a spherical form but rather an oval shape, then\r\n   it is proper, after a failure to secure the desired reduction by\r\n   the internal use of medicine, to resort to a surgical operation.\r\n\r\n   For the proper performance of this operation the surgeon\r\n   should be provided with a nicely rounded metal staff, flat on\r\n   one side, and a little larger than a goose’s quill. [Paré’s\r\n   grooved sound or director, says von Gurlt, had not yet at that\r\n   time been invented, and this staff was intended to serve, in\r\n   a crude fashion, the same purpose.] The first step is to make\r\n   an incision in the upper part of the scrotum, the direction in\r\n   which it is to be carried being toward the symphysis pubis. When\r\n   the hernial sac is reached the staff is introduced into the slit\r\n   and pushed upward between the wall of the sac and the fleshy\r\n   part of the penis, the flat side of the instrument being kept\r\n   uppermost, as it is upon this surface that the cutting with the\r\n   scalpel or the razor is to be done. After the end of the staff\r\n   has been pushed well upward the flesh of the scrotum is to be\r\n   divided upon the flat surface of this instrument; all danger\r\n   of injuring the intestine being thus avoided. Then the attempt\r\n   should cautiously be made to reduce or replace the intestinal\r\n   folds. But if these efforts fail,--owing to the excessive\r\n   distension of the bowel or because the constricting band has\r\n   not yet been sufficiently relaxed,--then the following steps\r\n   should be taken:--Grasp the spermatic cord (“_didymis_”),\r\n   lift up its enveloping membranes one by one with hooks, and\r\n   divide each one of them completely upon one’s finger nail, up\r\n   to the point where the intestine is encountered. Then, having\r\n   established, between the intestinal wall and the membranous\r\n   coverings of the cord, an aperture large enough to admit the end\r\n   of the metal staff, push the instrument onward and upward while\r\n   at the same time it is held as it were balanced in the air, so\r\n   that early warning may be communicated to the holding fingers in\r\n   case the instrument, as it travels onward, should become caught\r\n   in the folds of the intestine--an accident, however, which the\r\n   slippery nature of the outer surface of the intestine renders\r\n   improbable, but which nevertheless may occur if at any point\r\n   there happen to be a break in the continuity of the tissues. As\r\n   the next step in the operation the cord should be completely\r\n   divided high up (the incision being made upon the staff) close\r\n   to the opening in the peritoneum through which the folds of the\r\n   intestine forced their way, in the first instance, into the\r\n   scrotum; but the surgeon must, without fear of doing harm, and\r\n   remembering that he is dealing with conditions of a desperate\r\n   nature, see to it that the opening made in the peritoneum is\r\n   amply large. Finally, with the aid of a soft piece of linen\r\n   he should return the folds of the intestine to the peritoneal\r\n   cavity, etc. [The remaining portions of the description are of\r\n   minor importance and may well be omitted here.]\r\n\r\nFranco, speaking of those cases in which a portion of the omentum is\r\nfound projecting into the hernial sac, lays great stress upon the\r\nimportance of “not doing what many a surgeon has done in the past\r\nand what not a few are still doing in our time, viz., simply cutting\r\noff the imprisoned distal portion of this membrane and returning\r\nthe remainder to the peritoneal cavity without first ligating the\r\ndivided blood-vessels and then cauterizing the cut surface; the\r\ndanger being that a failure to take these steps frequently leads to\r\na fatal hemorrhage into the peritoneal cavity--an occurrence which\r\nactually happened to one of our most experienced surgeons in a case of\r\nenterepiplocele.”\r\n\r\nThere were certain operative procedures in which Franco took a greater\r\ninterest than in others. Thus, for example, he was particularly fond of\r\noperating for the relief of cataract, and the results which he obtained\r\nwere exceptionally favorable (180 cures out of a total of 200 cases\r\nsubjected to operation). Von Gurlt quotes him as saying:--\r\n\r\n   If I had to choose between operations for the cure of cataract\r\n   and abandoning all the rest of my surgical practice, I should\r\n   prefer to adopt the latter course, so highly do I estimate the\r\n   amount of good which I can do in this line of work, so very\r\n   important does it appear to me, and so small is the amount of\r\n   labor and worry which it entails.\r\n\r\nFranco was also greatly interested in the cure of stone in the bladder,\r\nand it was while treating cases of this character that he invented the\r\nvery important surgical procedure known in France as the “Franconian\r\noperation for stone in the bladder” (hypogastric cystotomy, suprapubic\r\nlithotomy). Here is the account which he gives of the circumstances\r\nunder which he was led to devise this method of removing a stone from\r\nthe bladder:--\r\n\r\n   I will mention here an experience which I had on one occasion\r\n   when I tried to remove a calculus from the bladder of a boy\r\n   about ten years of age. The stone was about as large as a\r\n   hen’s egg and resisted all my efforts to extract it by way of\r\n   the incision made in the perinaeum. Being in a quandary as to\r\n   how I should proceed next, and the parents and friends being\r\n   greatly demoralized by the suffering to which I was unavoidably\r\n   subjecting their child,--they maintained, I should add, that\r\n   they would rather have him die than be subjected to such awful\r\n   suffering;--and being influenced also by the thought that I\r\n   could not afford to have it charged against me that I was not\r\n   able to extract the calculus, I deliberately decided that I\r\n   would make an opening above the pubic bone, and would remove\r\n   the stone in this manner. Accordingly I incised the skin above\r\n   the pubes, a little to one side of the base of the penis, and\r\n   carried the knife through the soft tissues down to the calculus,\r\n   which I had simultaneously pushed upward by pressing the fingers\r\n   of my left hand against the perinaeum, while at the same time\r\n   my assistant made counter-pressure against the stone by firmly\r\n   compressing the abdominal wall above the object. This method of\r\n   extraction proved successful.\r\n\r\n   In due time the wounds healed firmly and the patient was\r\n   relieved of his trouble, but only after a long and most serious\r\n   illness.\r\n\r\nFranco does not appear to have performed the suprapubic operation\r\nfor the extraction of a cystic calculus more than once (the case\r\njust narrated), and he carefully refrains from recommending it to\r\nother physicians. Most surgical authors, says Edouard Nicaise, blame\r\nFranco very strongly for not having dared to recommend his suprapubic\r\noperation. “But I do not agree with this judgment; Franco should rather\r\nbe praised for his prudence in not immediately announcing to the world\r\nhis invention of an important surgical operation.”[90]\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of suprapubic lithotomy shows that Franco was\r\nlaboring under an exaggerated idea of the dangers attending this\r\noperation. The comments of Pascal Baseilhac--a nephew of “Brother\r\nCosmas” (the famous French lithotomist of the early part of the\r\neighteenth century) and himself a skilled lithotomist--are worthy\r\nof being repeated here. He says (p. 318 of his “_Traité sur la\r\nlithotomie_,” Paris, 1804): “Franco based his unwillingness to\r\nrecommend the operation of suprapubic lithotomy on the belief which\r\nwas then widely prevalent, and which still persists even in our time\r\n(middle of the eighteenth century), that the making of an incision into\r\nthe main body of the urinary bladder is sure to prove fatal, a belief\r\nwhich experience and observation have now shown to be unwarranted.”\r\n\r\nThe Franconian operation, the great value of which was not sufficiently\r\nappreciated by its inventor nor by contemporary surgeons, was revived\r\nin 1719 by an Englishman, John Douglas, the distinguished surgeon of\r\nWestminster Hospital, London, and the brother of James Douglas--the\r\nanatomist who in 1730 described so minutely the relations of the\r\nperitonaeum to the bladder (Douglas’ cul-de-sac).\r\n\r\nIn the case the history of which has just been narrated, the\r\ncircumstances attending the invention of the operation known to-day as\r\nsuprapubic cystotomy[91] or “suprapubic lithotomy,” were certainly of\r\nsuch an unfavorable character as to call for the display of an unusual\r\ndegree of courage, wisdom, patience and manual skill on the part of\r\nthe surgeon in charge; and it was through a careful consideration of\r\nthese facts that Edouard Nicaise was led to award such high praise to\r\nFranco for the work which he had done. Scarcely less remarkable is\r\nthe talent which the latter displayed in the invention of a forceps\r\n(Fig. 22) strong enough to crush all but the hardest calculi and\r\nyet so cleverly planned that it is practicable, while the crushing\r\nend of the instrument is lying inside the bladder, to separate the\r\nblades sufficiently far apart to render possible the grasping of the\r\nstone between the jaws of the instrument without at the same moment\r\ninjuriously crushing the soft parts in the narrow channel of the wound\r\nor opening.[92]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 22. PIERRE FRANCO’S FORCEPS FOR CRUSHING CALCULI\r\n  IN THE URINARY BLADDER.\r\n\r\n  (From Edouard Nicaise’s _Pierre Franco_, Paris, 1895.)\r\n\r\n  _a_, closed; _b_, open.]\r\n\r\nIn Franco’s day the belief was widely prevalent that there were\r\nremedies which possessed the power of dissolving a cystic calculus.\r\nHis own opinion in regard to this matter is expressed in the following\r\nwords: “I am astonished that there should be many men who do not\r\nhesitate to undertake the disintegration and pulverization of a stone\r\nin the bladder by the employment of remedies which are either to be\r\nadministered by the mouth or to be injected _per urethram_ into\r\nthat organ.” He adds that a remedy strong enough to dissolve even the\r\nsofter stones would become so changed and weakened in passing through\r\nthe various organs which it must traverse on its journey from the\r\nmouth to the bladder that it could not possibly produce the desired\r\neffect; nor could a chemical solution strong enough to dissolve such\r\na calculus be injected into the bladder by way of the urethra without\r\neither causing inflammation and ulceration of the walls of that organ\r\nor promptly exciting muscular contraction that would effectively expel\r\nthe solution.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be an appropriate place in which to state that lithotrity\r\nwas practiced at an earlier date by Antonio Beniveni (1440–1502), a\r\nFlorentine physician whose writings reveal him to have been a man of\r\na very practical and unprejudiced type of mind, a very clear writer,\r\nand a practitioner of wide experience. He also deserves credit for\r\nhaving been the first surgeon to revive the operation of tracheotomy, a\r\nprocedure which was carried out by Antyllus fourteen centuries earlier,\r\nbut which appears to have been forgotten during this long interval. He\r\nsaved a patient’s life by means of the operation.\r\n\r\nThe date of Franco’s death is not known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XL\r\n\r\n   THE DEVELOPMENT OF SURGERY IN FRANCE (Continued).--AMBROISE PARÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nAmbroise Paré was born, about the year 1517, at Laval, a small town in\r\nthe Department of Mayenne, France. His father was probably the valet\r\nand barber of the Count of Laval. He went to Paris in early manhood\r\nand spent three years, at this period, in fitting himself for the\r\ncareer of a surgeon. He attended lectures on anatomy and surgery, did a\r\ncertain amount of dissecting, served for over two years as a surgeon’s\r\nassistant in the great hospital of Hôtel-Dieu, made notes of some of\r\nthe cases which he saw, and was occasionally permitted to prescribe\r\nfor patients and even to perform some minor operations. From 1536\r\nonward, nearly up to the time of his death, he was almost continuously\r\nengaged, in the capacity of a surgeon, in accompanying different\r\nFrench armies on their military expeditions. His professional title\r\nat first was that of “barber,” but he doubtless very soon discovered\r\nthat, if he wished to advance, it would be absolutely necessary for\r\nhim to secure a higher title. Accordingly, in 1541, he and his friend\r\nThierry de Héry presented themselves for, and passed successfully,\r\nthe required examination and were accepted as “master-barbers.” It is\r\nan interesting fact that, during his long professional career, Paré\r\nwas Chief Surgeon to four Kings of France in succession--first to\r\nHenry the Second (1547–1559), next to Francis the Second (1559–1560),\r\nthen to Charles the Ninth (1560–1574), and finally to Henry the Third\r\n(1574–1589). The last-named King bestowed upon him the additional\r\nhonor of “Councilor to his Majesty.” He also served, during a certain\r\nperiod of his career, as an attending surgeon at Hôtel-Dieu. The three\r\nlarge volumes of Paré’s writings (Malgaigne’s edition) are filled with\r\nthe rich experience which this great surgeon gained in the course\r\nof a large private practice and in the field expeditions and sieges\r\nconducted during the reigns of these Kings. Interspersed among the\r\nreports of cases and descriptions of operations are to be found not a\r\nfew comments of a more general character and some biographic details\r\nwhich add greatly to the charm of the work as a whole, and which at\r\nthe same time make it possible to form a general idea of Paré’s traits\r\nof character. On almost every page one finds statements which reveal\r\nthe fact that he weighed almost all the duties of his daily life in a\r\nprofoundly religious manner. He showed himself warmly sympathetic for\r\nall those whose ailments he was called upon to treat, and he was always\r\nas ready to bestow his best services upon the Roman Catholics as upon\r\nthe Huguenots--to which latter denomination (if we may so call it) he\r\nhimself is commonly reported to have belonged. It seems to me more\r\nprobable, however, that he was a liberal-minded Roman Catholic rather\r\nthan a Protestant, for there is trustworthy evidence showing that all\r\nhis ten children were baptized in that faith and that he himself,\r\nnineteen years before the night of Saint Bartholomew (August 24, 1572),\r\nheld the office of “_Pathe_” in the church of the parish in which\r\nhe lived. Another prominent trait of Paré’s character was the modest\r\nestimate which he placed upon his own professional achievements. One of\r\nhis sayings, which occurs a number of times in his writings and which\r\nhas since become famous, is this:--\r\n\r\n    _Je le pansay, et Dieu le guarist._\r\n    [I dressed his wound and God caused it to heal.]\r\n\r\nSome of the other sayings attributed to his pen and printed under\r\nthe heading “Surgical Canons and Rules,” at the end of Book XXVI.,\r\nare characterized by a homely type of wisdom which seems to have\r\nsecured for them a permanent place in French literature. I give here\r\nin the form of English translations six or seven of the more striking\r\nspecimens:--\r\n\r\n   Mere knowledge without experience does not give the surgeon much\r\n   self-confidence.\r\n\r\n   Small will be the influence exerted by him who chooses surgery\r\n   as a career simply for what he may make out of it.\r\n\r\n   The frequent changing of physicians is not likely to bring\r\n   comfort to the patient.\r\n\r\n   The facts already discovered are few in comparison with those\r\n   which are yet to be brought to light. We must not allow\r\n   ourselves to lie down or fall asleep under the impression\r\n   that the ancients knew all or have divulged all that is worth\r\n   knowing. What they have accomplished should be utilized by us as\r\n   a sort of scaffolding from which a more extensive view may be\r\n   obtained.\r\n\r\nIn another place Paré expresses the same sentiment in a somewhat\r\ndifferent form, as follows:--\r\n\r\n   My professional brethren must not expect to find any new and\r\n   startling facts [Paré is speaking here of his treatise on\r\n   surgery], but simply here and there some little addition to\r\n   our previous stock of knowledge; for the good Guy de Chauliac\r\n   has taught us that we are like the child who sits astride the\r\n   giant’s neck; that is, we can see all that he sees and just a\r\n   little more--or, in other words, we are able, through the aid\r\n   afforded by the writings of our predecessors, to learn all that\r\n   they have learned, and may at the same time acquire a little\r\n   further knowledge through our own observations.\r\n\r\n   A remedy that has been thoroughly tested is better than one\r\n   recently invented.\r\n\r\n   An injury which opens a large blood-vessel is likely to lead the\r\n   victim of such a wound to the tomb.\r\n\r\n   It is always wise to hold out hope to the patient, even if the\r\n   symptoms point strongly to a fatal issue.\r\n\r\nAll through his professional career, but more especially during the\r\nlater years, Paré was repeatedly annoyed by the efforts which the\r\nMedical Faculty made to bring him into disrepute. These men were\r\nbitterly jealous of him on account of the great favor which he enjoyed\r\nat Court, and so they adopted every possible means to injure his\r\nreputation. When the complete collection of his writings was published\r\nin 1575, they petitioned the authorities not to allow these “works of\r\na very impudent and ignorant man” to be sold until they should have\r\nreceived the official sanction of the Faculty. One of Paré’s chief\r\noffenses, as it appears, was that of not writing his treatises in\r\nLatin, and among the twenty-nine specifications of his shortcomings was\r\nthat of plagiarism. (See remarks on this subject further on.)\r\n\r\nIn his efforts to extend his knowledge of the science of medicine, and\r\nin particular to learn what the ancients had written on the subject,\r\nParé soon discovered that many obstacles stood in his way. He did not\r\nallow himself, however, to be discouraged by this fact, but set to\r\nwork, without delay and in his usual resolute fashion, to remove them.\r\nHe found, in the first place, that all the available treatises of the\r\nancient medical authors were written in Latin, a language of which he\r\npossessed scarcely any knowledge. So he was obliged to hire men to\r\ntranslate for his own use large portions of these books. Then, at a\r\nlater date, after he had begun to accumulate notes for the treatises\r\nin which he proposed to publish his own experiences and his own views\r\nabout the surgical topics in which he was interested, he saw clearly\r\nthat suitable pictorial illustrations would add materially to the\r\nvalue of the written text, and he therefore did not hesitate to spend\r\na considerable sum of money--Malgaigne says three thousand livres--in\r\nhaving the needed drawings made. Paré was also in no small degree\r\na public benefactor, for he purchased the formulae of some of the\r\nmore valuable of the remedies employed by the leading charlatans, in\r\norder that he might print them and so place them within the reach of\r\neverybody.\r\n\r\nParé gives the following picturesque account of his first experiences\r\nas an army surgeon in actual warfare:--\r\n\r\n   In 1536, he says, I accompanied the large army sent to Turin by\r\n   Francis the First, King of France, to retake certain castles and\r\n   fortifications which were held at that time by the troops of\r\n   the Emperor Charles the Fifth. My official position was that of\r\n   surgeon to the foot soldiers; and when our men took possession\r\n   of Susa, after the enemy had been defeated, I was among the\r\n   first to enter the city. Our horses rode rough-shod over the\r\n   dead bodies lying on the roadway, and over the bodies of many\r\n   who were simply wounded. It excited my compassion strongly\r\n   to hear the cries of those who were thus subjected to great\r\n   additional suffering, and I could not help wishing that I had\r\n   never left Paris. Once actually in the city, I began to look\r\n   around for a stable in which the horses of myself and my orderly\r\n   might find shelter. The one I entered contained the corpses of\r\n   four soldiers who had presumably died there, and three badly\r\n   wounded men who were still alive, but whose faces were greatly\r\n   disfigured by the wounds which they had received, and who--as we\r\n   soon learned--were unable to see, hear or speak. An old soldier\r\n   who entered the stable at that moment, and whose pity was\r\n   excited by what he saw, asked me if it would be possible to save\r\n   the lives of the men who were so badly injured. I replied “No.”\r\n   He thereupon proceeded, without the least excitement and with\r\n   due gentleness, to cut the throats of all three. At the sight of\r\n   this act, of what seemed to me to be great cruelty, I exclaimed,\r\n   “You are a wicked man!” His reply was: “I pray God that, if it\r\n   should ever be my fate to be situated as these three men were\r\n   when I entered the stable, there may be somebody at hand who\r\n   will do to me what I have just done to these men, and will save\r\n   me from a lingering and painful death.”\r\n\r\n   When the fighting was entirely over, we surgeons had much work\r\n   to do. I had not yet had any personal experience with the\r\n   treatment of gunshot wounds, but I had read in Giovanni da\r\n   Vigo’s work that such injuries should be considered poisoned\r\n   wounds, by reason of their contact with gunpowder, and that the\r\n   correct way of treating such wounds was to cauterize them with\r\n   oil of sambucus (elder flowers) that was actually boiling and\r\n   to which a little theriaca had been added. At first I hesitated\r\n   somewhat about carrying out this practice, but after watching\r\n   the other surgeons, in order to learn exactly how they applied\r\n   the boiling oil, I plucked up my courage and did exactly what\r\n   they did. My supply of oil, however, soon gave out, and I then\r\n   decided to use as a substitute a healing preparation composed of\r\n   yolk of egg, oil of roses, and turpentine. I slept badly that\r\n   night, as I greatly feared that, when I came to examine the\r\n   wounded on the following morning, I should find that those whose\r\n   wounds I had failed to treat with boiling oil had died from\r\n   poisoning. I arose at a very early hour, and was much surprised\r\n   to discover that the wounds to which I had applied the egg and\r\n   turpentine mixture were doing well; they were quite free from\r\n   swelling and from all evidence of inflammatory action; and the\r\n   patients themselves, who showed no signs of feverishness, said\r\n   that they had experienced little or no pain and had slept quite\r\n   well.\r\n\r\n   On the other hand the men to whose wounds I had applied the\r\n   boiling oil said that they had experienced during the night, and\r\n   were still suffering from, much pain at the seat of the injury;\r\n   and I found that they were feverish and that their wounds were\r\n   inflamed and swollen. After thinking the matter over carefully,\r\n   I made up my mind that thenceforward I should abstain wholly\r\n   from the painful practice of treating gunshot wounds with\r\n   boiling oil.\r\n\r\nIn 1545, when he was about twenty-eight years of age, Paré was sent as\r\na military surgeon to Boulogne-sur-Mer, which at that moment was being\r\nbesieged by the French. In 1544 the city had been captured by the army\r\nof Henry the Eighth of England, and fighting of a desultory character\r\nwas in progress between the besiegers and the besieged at the time of\r\nParé’s arrival. He had not been there a long time when he was asked to\r\nsee professionally Francis of Lorraine, Duke of Guise, who had been\r\nseriously wounded by a lance in a recent encounter with the enemy. The\r\nmetal head of the weapon, under the impulse of a glancing blow, had\r\npenetrated the skin just above the right eye, had then traveled toward\r\nthe left side and in a slightly downward direction, along the surface\r\nof the skull, and had finally come to rest at a point behind and below\r\nthe left ear, near the nape of the neck. When the lance had penetrated\r\nthus far the wooden shaft broke in two, leaving the metal head in its\r\nentirety and a part of the shaft so firmly lodged in the wound that\r\ngreat force had to be employed before it was found possible, with the\r\naid of strong pincers, to extract it from its bed. An examination of\r\nthe injured parts then showed that there had been some fracturing of\r\nthe bony structures and extensive laceration of the arteries, veins,\r\nnerves, etc., but that the left eye had apparently not been seriously\r\ndamaged. The onlookers were naturally impressed with the belief that\r\nthe Duke could not possibly recover from such a slashing of the face\r\nand head; and Paré himself was careful at first not to commit himself\r\nto a prognosis of too favorable a nature. However, he treated the\r\nwound with the greatest care and in the course of a few weeks had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing his patient restored to perfect health, but with\r\na deeply scarred face.\r\n\r\nAs can readily be imagined, this experience proved a splendid triumph\r\nfor Paré, and speedily brought him into great favor at Court and among\r\nthe nobility throughout France.\r\n\r\nFor several years subsequent to these events, Paré continued to serve\r\nactively as a surgeon in the frequent wars which took place between\r\nthe royal troops of France and the armies of other European monarchs.\r\nIn 1552, when he was thirty-five years of age, his rank in the army\r\nwas raised to that of “Surgeon to the King,” the entire medical staff\r\nof that period consisting of twelve surgeons of this rank. In 1554 he\r\nwas admitted to the _Collège de Saint Côme_ in Paris, the highest\r\nprofessional honor to which a barber-surgeon might aspire; and in 1563,\r\nafter the siege of Rouen, he received the appointment of “First Surgeon\r\nto Charles the Ninth.” After the latter’s death, Henry the Third also\r\nappointed Paré to the same position in his Court. Thus, from almost the\r\nvery beginning of his professional career to the time of his death,\r\nParé was honored in every possible way by four successive Kings of\r\nFrance. It was Charles the Ninth, however, who appears to have taken\r\na greater interest in Paré’s prosperity than did either of the other\r\nthree Kings. It was at Charles the Ninth’s request, for example, that\r\nthe brother-in-law of the Duke of Ascot, the Marquis of Auret, sent\r\nfor Paré to undertake the treatment of a wound which he had received\r\nfrom a harquebus ball seven months previously. Paré gives the following\r\naccount of this interesting case which foreshadows--for example, in the\r\nchanging of the patient’s bed and linen and keeping him entertained\r\nduring convalescence--the best modern hospital nursing:--\r\n\r\n   On arriving at the Chateau of Auret, writes Paré, which is\r\n   located not far from Mons in Belgium, I learned that the\r\n   harquebus ball had entered the thigh near the knee, had done\r\n   considerable damage to the soft parts, and had fractured the\r\n   femur. When I was ushered into his bedchamber, I found the\r\n   Marquis very much emaciated, his eyes deeply sunken in their\r\n   sockets, his skin hot and of a yellowish hue, and his voice\r\n   feeble like that of man very near to death.... The leg was drawn\r\n   up against the wall of the abdomen, and two large bedsores\r\n   were visible posteriorly--one near the root of the spine and\r\n   the other somewhat higher up. Thus it was impossible for the\r\n   patient to assume any posture in which he would be free from\r\n   suffering.... All things considered, it did not seem to me that\r\n   the Marquis could possibly recover from such a combination of\r\n   bodily ills. Nevertheless, to give him some encouragement,--for\r\n   he was very low in spirits,--I told him that, with the aid of\r\n   God and the assistance of his regular medical attendants, I\r\n   would soon have him on his feet again....\r\n\r\n   After dinner, in the presence of the Duke of Ascot, a few\r\n   friends of the family, and the assembled physicians and\r\n   surgeons, I expressed considerable surprise that free openings\r\n   had not been made in the Marquis’s wounded thigh, in which bone\r\n   caries and decomposition of the resulting discharge were already\r\n   well established. The medical attendants replied that the\r\n   patient was unwilling to submit to any such measures, and that\r\n   he had even forbidden them to substitute clean linen bedclothes\r\n   for those which were soiled and which had not been changed\r\n   during the previous two months....\r\n\r\n   When the consultation had come to an end and the local medical\r\n   attendants had given their full approval of the different\r\n   measures which I recommended, ... I proceeded to carry them out\r\n   without further delay.\r\n\r\n   Two or three hours after the completion of this operative work I\r\n   instructed the house servants who were in immediate attendance\r\n   upon the Marquis to place alongside his bed a second one\r\n   equipped with a soft mattress, over which a fresh linen sheet,\r\n   etc., had been spread. The transfer from one bed to the other\r\n   was easily effected by a strong attendant, and when the change\r\n   had been made the Marquis manifested great contentment. Two\r\n   feather pillows were so placed under his back and loins that no\r\n   pressure whatever would be made upon his bedsores. A refreshing\r\n   sleep of four hours’ duration followed the adoption of these\r\n   different measures, and there was much rejoicing in the entire\r\n   household.\r\n\r\nAfter a course of treatment lasting several weeks, Paré says:--\r\n\r\n   Under this treatment the fever steadily diminished, the pain\r\n   grew less and less, and the patient’s strength increased. When\r\n   the proper moment arrived, I advised the Marquis to engage the\r\n   services of some musicians (players on stringed instruments)\r\n   and one or two comedians, in order that his spirits might be\r\n   cheered by occasional entertainments of this character. Already\r\n   at the end of one month we found it practicable to carry him\r\n   in a chair into the garden and as far as the entrance gate,\r\n   where he could watch the passers-by. When it became known among\r\n   the peasants that he was in the habit of sitting close to the\r\n   highway, they came from far and near to sing and dance in groups\r\n   for his entertainment. He was greatly loved by both the common\r\n   people and the nobility.\r\n\r\n   At the end of six weeks the Marquis was able to get about on\r\n   crutches, and two weeks later still I bade him good bye and\r\n   returned to Paris. Before I left he presented me with a gift of\r\n   great value, and the Duchess of Ascot insisted on my accepting\r\n   a beautiful diamond ring as a mark of her appreciation of the\r\n   services which I had rendered her brother.\r\n\r\nAmong the varied experiences which fell to the lot of Paré during\r\nhis association with Charles the Ninth, there is one which throws a\r\nlittle additional light upon the man’s manner of promptly dealing with\r\nan event which, without such promptness of action, might have led to\r\nserious consequences.\r\n\r\nHe was passing through Montpellier one day in company with the King,\r\nwhen he stopped for a few minutes at the shop of an apothecary for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining how he preserved alive the vipers which he used\r\nin compounding the remedy which is called “theriaca,” and which has\r\nbeen used from time immemorial as an antidote to the poison of venomous\r\nserpents. The apothecary placed before him a glass jar in which were\r\nkept a number of these reptiles; and, when Paré took one of them up in\r\nhis fingers in order to obtain a better view of his fangs, the reptile\r\nbit him near the tip of his index finger, between the nail and the\r\nflesh. The pain which immediately followed was severe, partly, as Paré\r\nexplains, because the tip of the finger is a very sensitive part, and\r\nprobably also on account of the irritating effect of the venom. Then,\r\nto quote Paré’s own words, “after making firm pressure upon the soft\r\nparts above the wound, to prevent the poison from traveling upward, I\r\ncrowded the skin downward in the hope of forcing as much of the venom\r\nas possible out of the finger. While doing these things I instructed\r\nthe apothecary’s assistant to mix some old theriaca with brandy, and\r\nthen to apply a pledget of cotton, saturated with the mixture, over\r\nthe wound. In the course of a few days, and with no other treatment,\r\nall effects of the bite disappeared.”\r\n\r\nIn 1536, two years after his first experience with actual warfare in\r\nthe vicinity of Susa, Italy, and while he was still very young to\r\nassume so great a responsibility, Paré--as we learn from the text of\r\nChapter 28, Book X., of Malgaigne’s edition--performed the operation\r\nof exarticulation of the elbow-joint (the first recorded instance of\r\nthis operation, says von Gurlt). The case was that of a common soldier\r\nwho had been shot through the forearm, a little above the wrist, who\r\nhad been treated unsuccessfully by other surgeons, and who, at the\r\ntime when he came under Paré’s care, was suffering from a variety of\r\ncomplications--viz., gangrene extending as high up as the shoulders,\r\nextensive inflammation of the integuments on the adjacent side of\r\nthe thorax, and other symptoms that pointed toward a fatal issue. To\r\ncomplicate matters, it was winter and the only approximately warm\r\nshelter available was a cow-stable. At this early date, in the history\r\nof surgery, the practice of ligating the blood-vessels which had been\r\ndivided in the course of an amputation had not yet been adopted, and\r\nconsequently the red-hot cautery had to be employed for arresting\r\nthe bleeding which followed the operation. (See also page 512.) In\r\naddition to the amputation it was found necessary to make a number of\r\nlong and deep incisions into the inflamed tissues and to apply the\r\nactual cautery freely “for the purpose of drying up and destroying\r\nthe virulent matters that had penetrated these parts.” Then, fourteen\r\ndays later, the patient, who had been lying all this time, exposed to\r\ndraughts of air, upon a receptacle intended for the storage of grain,\r\nand who was protected from the cold by only the scantiest coverings,\r\ndeveloped trismus (lockjaw). When this new complication appeared Paré,\r\nalready at his wits’ end to find means with which to overcome the\r\ndifficulties which surrounded the case, decided first to have the man\r\nremoved to an adjacent stall in which there were several cows, the\r\npresence of which in such a confined space might be counted upon to\r\nincrease appreciably the warmth of the surrounding air. Next, he gave\r\norders to rub briskly the back of the patient’s neck, as well as the\r\nshoulders, the uninjured arm and the legs, with heated cloths which\r\nwere immediately afterward to be wrapped around him; and then, for\r\nan outside covering, he utilized the straw and cows’ dung which were\r\nplentifully within reach. In addition, two braziers which had been\r\nprocured from a neighboring dwelling, were charged with coals and kept\r\nburning close to him. During three successive days and nights these\r\nmeasures were kept up faithfully, and from time to time a mixture of\r\nmilk and soft egg was introduced into the patient’s mouth through a\r\nsuitable tube, after the jaws had first been pried open by a bit of\r\nwillow wood. The effect of these measures was to make the patient\r\nperspire copiously and to induce a gentle action of the bowels; and,\r\nas a further effect, the trismus was also overcome. For some time\r\nafterward, in addition to the ordinary dressing of the healing wounds,\r\nit was thought best to apply the red-hot cautery regularly at certain\r\nintervals to the end of the bone of the upper arm. (This practice was\r\nabandoned by Paré at a later date.) Final and perfect healing took\r\nplace after several large splinters of bone had been exfoliated.\r\n\r\nAt the end of his account of what one is tempted to call the wonderful\r\nvictory of a surgeon over the death that threatened to carry off this\r\ngravely wounded soldier, Paré adds one of his characteristic appeals to\r\nthe oncoming younger generation of physicians:--\r\n\r\n   Both God and Nature constantly remind the surgeon that, no\r\n   matter how poor, in a given case, the prospect of a cure may\r\n   seem, he should not for one moment cease doing his full duty;\r\n   for Nature often accomplishes what the surgeon believes to be\r\n   impossible. Cornelius Celsus [about the time of Jesus Christ]\r\n   says: “_Contingunt in morbis monstra, sicut et in natura_.”\r\n   [Marvels are observed in diseases, very much in the same manner\r\n   as they are frequently encountered in nature.]\r\n\r\nIn the two preceding histories of actual cases treated,--one of these\r\npatients being a wealthy officer of high rank and birth, and the other\r\na common soldier of the peasant class,--we obtain the best of evidence\r\nthat Paré was not influenced by the wealth, rank or social position of\r\nhis patients. Upon both classes he bestowed freely the fruits of his\r\nknowledge, experience and skill.\r\n\r\nThe first mention, in medical literature, of a fracture through the\r\nneck of the femur close to the joint, is to be found in Chapter 21,\r\nBook XIII., of Paré’s treatise (page 753, Vol. II., of Malgaigne’s\r\nedition). Furthermore, the first published account of a case of\r\ndiaphragmatic hernia is that given by Paré. (Von Gurlt.)\r\n\r\nIn 1538, during a visit to Turin in the capacity of surgeon to the\r\nMareschal de Montjean, Paré was asked by the latter to take charge of\r\none of his pages who had been wounded by a stone which struck him on\r\nthe right side of the head, causing a fracture of the parietal bone,\r\nwith escape of a portion of the brain substance from the external\r\nwound. The subsequent history of this case is given by Paré in the\r\nfollowing words:--\r\n\r\n   As soon as I fully realized the true nature of the injury and\r\n   had examined the mass of tissue (about the size of a small nut)\r\n   which had been expelled from the wound, I predicted that the\r\n   patient would probably not recover. A young surgeon who happened\r\n   to come into the room at this moment, examined the mass of\r\n   tissue which had escaped from the wound and at once pronounced\r\n   it to be fat. I assured him that, if he would wait until I had\r\n   finished dressing the patient’s wound, I would prove to him that\r\n   the mass was in reality cerebral tissue and not fat.... If this\r\n   substance, I said, is fat, it will float on the water; but, if\r\n   it is brain tissue, it will sink at once to the bottom of the\r\n   dish. And, again, if it is fat it will promptly melt on exposure\r\n   to heat, whereas brain substance will simply become desiccated.\r\n   These tests were applied and it was shown that the tissue\r\n   consisted, as I had declared, of brain substance.\r\n\r\n   Notwithstanding the apparently serious damage which had been\r\n   inflicted upon his brain the page made a good recovery, but\r\n   remained permanently deaf in the right ear.\r\n\r\nAmong Paré’s numerous reports of cases there is one which possesses,\r\nas I believe, sufficient interest--as well from the viewpoint of the\r\npathologist as from that of the surgeon--to justify me in reproducing\r\nit, in a somewhat condensed form, in the present chapter.\r\n\r\nHenry the Second, King of France, while tilting (June 30, 1559)\r\nwith Gabriel, Count of Montgomery, an officer of that sovereign’s\r\nScottish Lifeguard, received injuries which soon afterward proved\r\nfatal. Montgomery’s lance--so Paré’s account states--struck the King’s\r\nvizor and, breaking off at the spot where the metal tip or head is\r\nattached to the wooden shaft, carried away this part of the helmet.\r\nThen, impelled by the force which had originally been communicated\r\nto the lance, the splintered end of its shaft struck the King’s now\r\nunprotected head with great violence just above the right eyebrow,\r\ntore up the skin and underlying muscular tissue of the forehead as\r\nfar as the outer angle of the left orbit, and finally destroyed the\r\nadjacent eye. Five or six of the most experienced surgeons of France\r\nwere immediately summoned, and Philip the Second, King of Spain, sent\r\nVesalius from Brussels to aid them in their efforts to save the injured\r\nKing’s life. But all the measures adopted proved of no avail. Henry the\r\nSecond died on the eleventh day following the injury. Although in the\r\npublished account no statement is made to the effect that Paré was one\r\nof the surgeons who attended the King during his illness, Malgaigne\r\nexpresses the opinion that he was probably present in the capacity of\r\na consultant; and the interesting comments which he (Paré) makes on\r\nthe nature and extent of the injury inflicted certainly justify this\r\nopinion. No evidence of fracture of the skull was discovered either\r\nbefore death or at the postmortem examination, and the most conspicuous\r\nsymptoms appear to have been fever and a comatose condition. At\r\nthe autopsy there was found, on the left side posteriorly, in the\r\noccipital region, a clot of blood lying between the pia and the dura\r\nmater. The brain substance in the immediate vicinity of the clot was\r\nof a yellowish tinge and showed evidences of having already begun to\r\nundergo decomposition. Paré’s diagnosis, in this case, was that of\r\nviolent concussion of the brain with rupture of meningeal vessels by\r\n_contre-coup_ at a point opposite to that at which the blow\r\nwas originally inflicted by the lance. He did not believe that the\r\nimmediate damage done to the frontal portion of the cranium and to the\r\nleft eye had anything to do with the fatal issue.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIGS. 23 AND 24.\r\n\r\n  FORCEPS DEVISED IN 1552 BY AMBROISE PARÉ FOR DRAWING OUT THE CUT\r\n  ENDS OF ARTERIES AFTER THE AMPUTATION OF A LIMB, AND HOLDING\r\n  THEM WHILE THE LIGATURE IS BEING APPLIED.\r\n\r\n  (From von Gurlt’s _Geschichte der Chirurgie_, Berlin, 1898.)\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23 represents the earlier; FIG. 24 the\r\n  later pattern (see text.)]\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest discoveries made by Paré in the domain of surgery\r\nis his method of promptly, effectively and safely arresting the\r\nbleeding from the divided vessels of the stump after the amputation of\r\na limb. This discovery was made between the years 1552 and 1564, before\r\nwhich period it had been customary to arrest the bleeding by applying\r\nthe red-hot cautery iron to the exposed ends of the divided vessels.\r\nThe new method consisted in tying a ligature (preferably doubled)\r\naround the free or cut end of the blood-vessel, and allowing it to\r\nremain undisturbed _in situ_ until, as the result of a localized\r\nsuppuration, it should be cast off. The accompanying cuts (Figs. 23 and\r\n24) which have been copied from an earlier edition (1585) of Paré’s\r\nwork, represent the kind of forceps which he employed in separating\r\nthe free end of the artery or vein from the soft tissues in which it\r\nwas imbedded--a preliminary procedure which enabled him to tie the\r\nligature firmly around the vessel. The earlier pattern of forceps (Fig.\r\n23) was not equipped with a spring, the purpose of which was to keep\r\nthe opposing blades separated, but the later pattern (Fig. 24) has\r\nthis useful addition. Another instrument which owes its origin to the\r\ninventive genius of Paré is the grooved director--an instrument that\r\nis of great value to the surgeon, particularly in operations for the\r\nrelief of strangulated hernia.\r\n\r\nBesides the two inventions to which a brief reference has just been\r\nmade, Paré describes and pictures in his great treatise scores of\r\ninstruments and apparatus of all sorts, many of them doubtless products\r\nof his own inventive genius. But to assign to these contrivances their\r\ntrue value calls for a degree of expert knowledge which I do not\r\npossess. Rather than to attempt any such appraisal, I prefer to furnish\r\nhere a summary of the more important of Paré’s achievements in surgery;\r\nfor such an enumeration--although it may prove to be in some measure\r\na recapitulation of things that have already been mentioned in the\r\npreceding account--may be found useful for purposes of reference:--\r\n\r\n   The discovery of improved methods of caring for the wounded\r\n   on the battle-field and of transporting them to a hospital or\r\n   other refuge; the introduction of better methods of treating\r\n   wounds inflicted in warfare--especially gunshot wounds; the\r\n   correction of the idea, universally accepted at the beginning\r\n   of the sixteenth century, that bullets are sufficiently hot,\r\n   upon penetration of the skin, to affect injuriously the wounds\r\n   which they inflict;[93] the substitution of ligation of bleeding\r\n   vessels (of an amputation stump) for the prevailing practice of\r\n   applying to them the red-hot cautery iron; the abandonment of\r\n   the practice of applying the heated cautery iron to the surface\r\n   of section of a sawed bone; the performance, for the first\r\n   time, of exarticulation of the elbow-joint; the demonstration\r\n   of the usefulness of more frequently employing orthopaedic\r\n   apparatus and prosthetic contrivances; and the introduction of\r\n   improvements in the operation of trephining the skull.\r\n\r\nIt was a very common practice among the medical authors of the\r\nsixteenth century--and, indeed, among authors generally--to utilize\r\nthe writings of their predecessors without giving them proper credit\r\nfor their work; and Paré, it appears, was not entirely free from this\r\nfault. Von Gurlt mentions a few of the more glaring instances of such\r\nsinning, and among them the following: Paré’s two chapters on tumors\r\nare taken from the “_De institutione chirurgica_” of Jean Tagault\r\n(Paris, 1543), who in turn is charged with having borrowed the data\r\nfrom Guy de Chauliac’s treatise; in his chapter on wounds in general,\r\nParé has also borrowed largely from the same work; and the chapter\r\nwhich he devotes to the subject of special wounds is taken from the\r\nwritings of Hippocrates; and, finally, he has transferred almost\r\nbodily Philippe de Flesselle’s “_Introduction pour parvenir à la\r\nvraie cognoissance de la chirurgie rationelle_.” Before we condemn\r\nParé for plagiarism, and although the facts as stated by von Gurlt are\r\nundeniable, we should take several things into careful consideration.\r\nIt is fitting, for example, that we should make some sort of an\r\nestimate of the value of the text thus appropriated, in order that we\r\nmay be able to measure the seriousness of Paré’s sinning; and, if we do\r\nthis, we cannot fail to be struck with its insignificance in comparison\r\nwith the admittedly valuable character of all the remaining text of\r\nthese three huge volumes--text which bears every mark of being the\r\nproduct of Paré’s brain. Paré himself, in speaking of his borrowings\r\nfrom other authors, says that his acts of this nature are “as harmless\r\nas the lighting of one candle from the flame of another.” Then, again,\r\nthere are several of these borrowings which are evidently the handiwork\r\nof a rather dull person, and this fact alone makes one bold to assert\r\nthat Paré, who was certainly not lacking in brains or in a desire\r\nto follow the golden rule in his treatment of the property of such\r\nwriters, could scarcely have been guilty of such clumsily contrived\r\ninterpolations. Inasmuch, however, as many important facts bearing\r\nupon the question at issue are not within my reach, I am obliged, in\r\nmy attempt to defend the memory of Paré, to fall back upon speculative\r\nreasoning. The medical profession at large has long since heard this\r\ncharge of plagiarism and it refuses to attach any importance to it as\r\naffecting the personal character of Paré. It prefers to believe that\r\nhe is guiltless and that somebody else--at a time, perhaps, when Paré,\r\nbeing well advanced in years, was too ill to revise the manuscript of\r\nthe “Collection of his Writings” edited by Guillemeau--thoughtlessly\r\nyielded to the impulse to remedy, by borrowing from other sources,\r\nthe trivial defects or omissions noted in the text. In any case,\r\nwhatever the actual truth may be, I am, I believe, justified in\r\nmaintaining that Paré is not rightly chargeable with the guilt of\r\nplagiarism.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 25. AMBROISE PARÉ, THE FAMOUS FRENCH SURGEON\r\n  OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n  (From von Gurlt’s reproduction of the portrait published by Le\r\n  Paulmier, Paris, 1885.)]\r\n\r\nStrange as it might appear, if history did not furnish many examples\r\nof the same character, Paré’s merits as a man and as a surgeon were\r\nnot as fully appreciated as they deserved to be until after the\r\nlapse of nearly two centuries. In 1812 the _Société de Médecine de\r\nBordeaux_ offered a prize for the best eulogy of Ambroise Paré,\r\nand it was awarded to Vimont. Finally, in 1840, a fine bust of the\r\ndistinguished surgeon was completed by the sculptor David of Angers,\r\nand set up in bronze in Laval, Paré’s birthplace. The portrait here\r\nreproduced from the engraving in von Gurlt’s work represents the bust\r\nin question (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\nA complete collection of the writings of Paré has been prepared by\r\nJ. F. Malgaigne, the distinguished French surgeon, and published in\r\nthree very large volumes (Paris, 1840–1841). This collection is based\r\non a careful comparison and collation of all the previously published\r\neditions. The contents of these volumes cover very nearly the entire\r\nrange of surgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nSURGERY IN GREAT BRITAIN DURING THE SIXTEENTH AND SEVENTEENTH CENTURIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain the cultivation of the science of medicine began at\r\na much later date than it did on the continent of Europe, and, so far\r\nas may be judged from the facts within our reach, there were, in the\r\nearly part of the sixteenth century, very few Englishmen who could\r\njustly lay claim to the possession of more than the rudiments of\r\nthe art of surgery. Two centuries earlier, as I have already stated\r\nin a previous chapter, there were three men in England who gained\r\nconsiderable fame in this department of medicine. They were Gilbert\r\n“the Englishman” (1210), John of Gaddesden (1320), the author of the\r\nfamous book entitled “Rosa Anglica,” and John of Ardern (_circa_\r\n1350); but afterward, for a period of nearly two hundred years, the\r\nrecords fail to reveal to us a single surgeon of any note. Then during\r\nthe sixteenth century the only English surgeons whose names deserve to\r\nbe perpetuated are Gale, Clowes and Woodall, of whom I shall presently\r\ngive brief accounts. They were all at one time or another, as in the\r\ncase of the leading continental surgeons of that period, officially\r\nconnected with the army. Some idea of the unsatisfactory state of the\r\nmedical service in the English army of that period may be gathered from\r\nthe statements made by Gale regarding this matter. From his account it\r\nappears that in 1544 the army was accompanied by a miscellaneous crowd\r\nof men who were supposed to be in some measure physicians, but who in\r\nreality were uneducated quacks, vendors of all sorts of dressings and\r\nwashes for wounds, of infallible cures for gunshot injuries, etc. The\r\nmortality in the English camp was, as might readily be expected, very\r\nheavy. The same state of things existed, at a somewhat later date, in\r\nthe fleet sent against the Spanish Armada. It is not to be wondered\r\nat, therefore, that very few of the educated surgeons were willing to\r\naccept service in the English army or the English fleet, especially as\r\nthe pay which they received was no greater than that of the drummers\r\nand trumpeters. Toward the end of the century much greater attention\r\nwas paid to the care of the wounded and crippled, and, in corroboration\r\nof this, it may be stated that Henry the Fourth, King of France,--who,\r\nit may safely be assumed, was influenced to take this step by the\r\nenlightened advice of Ambroise Paré,--ordered the establishment of\r\nmilitary hospitals for the use of the army which was at that time\r\nbesieging Amiens. And again, at a later date (1603), there was\r\nestablished at Paris a retreat for old and infirm or mutilated officers\r\nand soldiers.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact that during the year 1544, while Henry the\r\nEighth of England, in alliance with the German Emperor Charles the\r\nFifth, was carrying on the war against Francis the First, King of\r\nFrance, there were present, on the soil of the latter country, all the\r\nleading European surgeons of that period--viz., Ambroise Paré, with\r\nthe French army which was laying siege to Boulogne-sur-Mer (captured\r\na few months earlier by the English troops); Thomas Gale, the most\r\nfamous surgeon of that day in England, with the army of the besieged;\r\nand Vesalius and Daza Chacon with the troops of Charles the Fifth\r\nat Landrecy (near the Belgian boundary, south of Brussels) and at\r\nSt. Didier (in the northeastern part of France). I have already, in\r\npreceding chapters, given brief accounts of the lives and professional\r\naccomplishments of all these surgeons with the exception of Gale, and\r\nit only remains now to supply such information as may be obtainable\r\nconcerning the latter and also concerning his contemporaries, the\r\nEnglish surgeons Clowes and Woodall.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Gale._--Thomas Gale was born in London in 1507, practiced\r\nmedicine for some years in that city, and then, in the capacity of\r\na surgeon, entered the service of the army under Henry the Eighth.\r\nAt a later date he joined the army of Philip the Second of Spain. In\r\n1544 he was present at the battle of Montreuil in France, and he was\r\nalso present at the siege of St. Quentin, in 1557. Two years later he\r\nreturned to London and became a member of the Barber-Surgeons’ Company.\r\nHis death occurred in 1587.\r\n\r\nGale was the author of several books on surgical subjects, the most\r\nimportant of these works being that which deals with gunshot wounds.\r\nHis views regarding wounds of this nature agree in the main with the\r\nteachings of Ambroise Paré; and yet, according to von Gurlt, he appears\r\nto have formed his opinions independently, for he does not once mention\r\nthat surgeon’s name. He was not only a skilful surgeon, but also a man\r\nof scientific and literary tastes, as shown by his translations of some\r\nof Galen’s writings and of Giovanni da Vigo’s treatise on surgery, and\r\nalso by his own published works. His book on gunshot wounds, to which\r\nreference has already been made, is the one which reflects the greatest\r\ncredit upon the author. One of its chief merits is to be found in the\r\nfact that it enabled the physicians of England to keep in some measure\r\nabreast of their brethren on the continent, at least in the matter of\r\ntreatment by surgical means. In one part of the work he makes reference\r\nto the belief, which was held at that time by many surgeons, that the\r\nbullet not only scorched the flesh of the wound which it inflicted but\r\nalso introduced into it a poisonous element. I quote here one or two\r\nextracts from the comments to which I have just referred:--\r\n\r\n   The usuall Gonnepouder is not venemous, nother the shotte\r\n   of such hoteness as is able to warme the fleshe, much lesse\r\n   to make an ascar.... Hange a bagge ful of Gonnepouder on a\r\n   place convenient: and then stand so far of as your peece wil\r\n   shote leavell, and shote at the same, and you shall see the\r\n   Gonnepouder to bee no more set on fyer with the heat of the\r\n   stone [used as a bullet] than if you caste a cold stone at it.\r\n\r\nAn English translation of Paré’s book, says von Haller, was not\r\npublished until 1577. It is therefore not strange that Gale, whose book\r\nwas printed fourteen years earlier (_i.e._, in 1563), should\r\nhave made no mention of that author’s method of applying ligatures\r\nto the bleeding vessels of an amputation stump. The first reference\r\n(in English) to this plan of preventing hemorrhage from the divided\r\nblood-vessels in an amputation stump occurs--so far as I have been able\r\nto discover--in the treatise published in London by William Clowes, in\r\n1588, under the title “A prooved practise for all young chirurgians\r\netc.” Clowes, however, erroneously gives the credit for this important\r\nprocedure to Guillemeau, one of Paré’s pupils.\r\n\r\nIn one of his writings Gale states, after witnessing the surgical\r\npractice at the Royal hospitals of St. Bartholomew and St. Thomas in\r\n1562, “that it was saide that Carpinters, women, weuvers, coblers and\r\ntinkers did cure more people than the chirurgians.” (South.)\r\n\r\n_William Clowes._--William Clowes was born, about the year 1540,\r\nat Kingsbury, in Warwickshire, and received his early training in\r\nsurgery under George Keble of London. In 1563 he accepted the position\r\nof surgeon in the army which was under the command of Earl Ambrose\r\nof Warwick and was stationed at that time in France. Six years later\r\nhe settled in London, and was made a member of the Barber-Surgeons’\r\nCompany. In 1575 he received an appointment on the Surgical Staff of\r\nSt. Bartholomew’s Hospital and six years later still he was promoted to\r\nthe rank of full surgeon, a position which he already held in Christ’s\r\nHospital. In 1585 he resigned his appointment at St. Bartholomew’s and\r\naccepted an invitation to serve in the Earl of Leicester’s army, which\r\nwas at that time in the Netherlands. During this war Clowes acquired\r\na rich and varied experience in the treatment of wounds. Soon after\r\nhis return to London in 1588 he joined the fleet which vanquished the\r\nSpanish Armada. Later, he was given the appointment of Surgeon to the\r\nQueen. His death took place at Plaistow, County of Essex, in August,\r\n1604. Von Gurlt does not hesitate to qualify him as one of the most\r\ndistinguished English surgeons of his day.\r\n\r\nOf the four surgical treatises which were written by Clowes, and of\r\nwhich several editions were published between the years 1575 and 1637,\r\nthere is only one to which I shall refer in this brief account, viz.,\r\nthat which, in the edition of 1637, bears the title: “A profitable and\r\nnecessarie Book of Observations, for all those that are burned with the\r\nflame of Gun-Powder.” This book is full of brief histories of cases\r\nwhich came under the author’s personal observation, and it therefore\r\nfurnishes an excellent and truthful picture of the kind of wounds which\r\nthe highwaymen and soldiers of that day inflicted, and of the treatment\r\nwhich was employed by the best English surgeons. The following may\r\nserve as sufficient examples:--\r\n\r\n(1) A clothier, who had been assailed by robbers, received a dangerous\r\nwound in the left thigh. It was about four inches long and of such a\r\ndepth that “the rotula or round bone of the knee did hang downe very\r\nmuch.” Clowes first removed a clot of blood from the wound and then,\r\n“with a sharp and square-pointed needle, armed with a strong, even and\r\nsmooth silke thred, well waxed, introduced five stitches, one good\r\ninch distant betweene every stitch, leaving a decent place for the\r\nwound to purge at.” He then applied a suitable bandage. The patient’s\r\nfriends were not at all pleased that Clowes, having pronounced the\r\nwound dangerous, should not have been willing to state how much time\r\nwould elapse before it would be healed. So they called in a charlatan,\r\nwho on the following day removed the dressings and cut through all\r\nthe stitches. Seven days later, Clowes was once more asked to see\r\nthe case. He found the wound gaping widely and in a bad state. After\r\nadopting such measures as were most urgently required, he brought\r\nthe edges of the wound together by the application of three strips\r\nof sticking-plaster. In due time healing took place, “but the motion\r\nperished: for the patient had the imperfection of a stiff knee, which\r\nconstrained him to use a leather strap, fastened unto the toe of his\r\nshooe, and again made fast unto his body; and so he remaineth unto this\r\nday.”\r\n\r\n(2) The history of the second case may be given here in the following\r\nbrief outlines. The patient, a ship’s gunner, was wounded in the lower\r\npart of the abdomen by what was probably a partially spent ball. The\r\nwound made by the missile was of such a nature that it permitted a\r\nlarge portion of the “zirbus” (omentum), together with some of the\r\nintestinal canal, to protrude from the opening. After making a careful\r\nexamination of the parts, Clowes was satisfied that the intestine was\r\nstill uninjured.\r\n\r\n   Then with a strong double thread I did tie fast the zirbus as\r\n   close unto the wound as possible wel I might, and within a\r\n   finger bredth or thereabouts I did cut off that part of the\r\n   zirb that hanged out of the wound, and so I cauterized it with\r\n   a hot iron almost to the knot; all this being done, I put again\r\n   into the body that part of the zirb which I had fast tied, and\r\n   I left the peece of thred hanging out of the wound: which,\r\n   within four or five days after, nature cast forth, the thred\r\n   as I say being fast tied; then presently I did take a needle\r\n   with a double strong silke thred waxed, wherewith I did thrust\r\n   thorow both mirach [skin, adipose layer and muscular tissue]\r\n   and ziphach [peritoneum] on the right side of the wound, but\r\n   on the left side of the wound I did put the needle but thorow\r\n   mirach only, and so tied these three fast together with a very\r\n   strong knot, and presently I did cut of the thred.... All which\r\n   is according to Weckers[94] and other learned men’s opinions\r\n   and practices, who also say that the stitches of the one side\r\n   must be higher than on the other side. [The usual dressings were\r\n   afterward applied and were renewed three days later. At the end\r\n   of twenty-one days the wound was found to be completely healed.]\r\n\r\nIn chapter 27 of the same work there is given a list of the medicaments\r\nand instruments with which a field-or ship’s-surgeon should be equipped\r\nbefore he engages in active service. From this list I select the\r\nfollowing items as showing--at least in some measure--in what respect\r\nthe tools employed by surgeons four hundred years ago differ from\r\nthe modern ones of a similar character: “Small and long waxe candles\r\nto search the hollownesse or depth of a wound.” “Small buttons or\r\ncauterizing irons meete to stay the flux of an artery or veine.” “A\r\ntrepan.” “Needles two or three, some eight inches, some ten or twelve\r\ninches in length, having a decent eye in it guttered like a Spanish\r\nneedle, and point or end blunt or round, that it offend not in the\r\ngoing in of it, made fit to draw a Flammula, or a pece of fine lawne\r\nor linnen cloth through the body or member that is wounded.” “As for\r\nstitching quils and other instruments, that a Surgeon ought always to\r\ncarry about him, I leave unspoken of.”\r\n\r\nIn praise of one of the plasters enumerated in the list, Clowes\r\nnarrates the following incident which occurred near Arnheim in the\r\nNetherlands: “A horseman was wounded with a pike neere the middle of\r\nhis right thigh; the weapon so passing upwards that by good fortune it\r\nrested upon the os pubis, otherwise he had been slaine.” As the first\r\nstep in the treatment, the copious bleeding was arrested; after which\r\nwarm _oleum hyperici_ [oil of St. John’s wort] was injected into\r\nthe wound, then a short tent was introduced, and the sticking plaster\r\nwas applied on the outside. “Thus he was cured in fourteene days, and\r\nso was ready to serve in the field again.”\r\n\r\n_John Woodall._--John Woodall or Woodhall was born in England\r\nabout 1569, and was sent as a military surgeon to France by Queen\r\nElizabeth with the troops which Her Majesty placed at the disposal\r\nof the French King, Henry the Fourth. After his return to England,\r\nWoodall was made a surgeon of St. Bartholomew’s Hospital and also\r\nSurgeon-General of the East India Company. He was already at that time\r\na member of the Company of Barber-Surgeons of London. Woodall must have\r\nhad a very extensive experience in the practice of surgery, for he\r\nstates that he had performed the operation of amputation of a limb more\r\nthan one hundred times. The date of his death is not known.\r\n\r\nVon Gurlt calls attention to the fact that the first notice printed\r\nin English of Ambroise Paré’s method of ligating blood-vessels after\r\nan amputation is to be found in the treatise written by John Woodall\r\nand published in London in 1639, under the title: “The Surgeon’s Mate,\r\nor Military and Domestic Surgery.” As the first edition of this book,\r\nwhich was published in 1617, says nothing about Paré’s method, it seems\r\npermissible to infer that the news of this improvement, one of the\r\nmost important made in surgery (1552), reached England from France only\r\nafter the lapse of eighty-seven years! There can be scarcely any doubt,\r\nhowever, that individual English surgeons had already learned about\r\nParé’s improved method at a much earlier date.\r\n\r\n_State of Surgery in England During the Seventeenth\r\nCentury._--Before I pass on to the consideration of the state of\r\nsurgery in England during the seventeenth century it seems desirable\r\nthat I should say a few words with regard to the relative standing of\r\nthe two branches of the medical profession--the physicians and the\r\nsurgeons--in the esteem of their fellow Englishmen at this period\r\nof history. In France, it will be remembered, a surgeon was looked\r\nupon, even as recently as during the first half of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, as a man of inferior social standing, perhaps a shade better\r\nthan an apothecary, but certainly far below his more highly educated\r\nassociate--the physician. The favors extended by French Royalty to\r\nAmbroise Paré and the very high esteem in which he was held by French\r\nsociety in general effected a great change in the relative status of\r\nthe two classes of practitioners in France; and, as a result of this\r\nchange in public opinion, medical practitioners, subsequent to 1560 or\r\n1570, were led to realize that a surgeon, if sufficiently educated,\r\nif earnestly devoted to his professional work, and if intent upon\r\nhelping his fellow men rather than upon accumulating a fortune, might\r\nconfidently aspire to a position of equality with the best physicians\r\nof the community in which he lived. In England a similar change of\r\nopinion in regard to the honorableness of the career of surgeon\r\ntook place about this time, probably in consequence of the great\r\nreputation gained by Gale, Clowes and Woodall. In both countries the\r\nchange occurred slowly, and in France what was gained during Paré’s\r\nlifetime seemed afterward to be lost for a period of several years.\r\nBut eventually the prevailing opinion again became favorable to the\r\nsurgeons, and from that time to the present they have enjoyed an\r\never-increasing esteem in public opinion. But there was a brief period,\r\nearly in the seventeenth century, when it must have been very galling\r\nto the pride of an honorable and experienced surgeon to be placed as\r\nit were under the tutelage of the physicians who were his official\r\nassociates in certain hospitals--as, for example, in St. Bartholomew’s,\r\nLondon. The following extracts[95] from the “Orders” or “Articles” of\r\nthat institution (1633) explain more precisely what is meant by the use\r\nof the word “tutelage”:--\r\n\r\n   9. That no surgeon or his man do trepan the head, pierce the\r\n   body, dismember or do any great operation on the body of any but\r\n   with the approbation and by the direction of the Doctor (when\r\n   conveniently it may be had) and the surgeons shall think it\r\n   needful to require.\r\n\r\n   13. That every surgeon shall follow the directions of the Doctor\r\n   in outward operations for inward causes, for recovery of every\r\n   patient under their several cures, and to this end shall once in\r\n   the week attend the Doctor, at the set hour he sitteth to give\r\n   directions for the poor.\r\n\r\n    (From St. Bartholomew’s Hospital Reports, Vol. XXII., 1886.)\r\n\r\nAmong the English surgeons of the seventeenth century there appears to\r\nhave been only one who attained some degree of eminence, viz., Richard\r\nWiseman, who is often spoken of as the Ambroise Paré of England.\r\nHaeser mentions 1625 as the date of his birth, and at the same time\r\nstates that he was in the service of the Stuart Kings from Charles\r\nthe First to James the Second. It seems to me highly probable that\r\nthis statement regarding the date of Wiseman’s birth is erroneous; for\r\nif it be accepted as correct, then he (Wiseman) must have been only\r\nfifteen years of age when he first started out with the prince (in\r\n1640) on the latter’s wanderings through France and the Low Countries.\r\nOn the other hand, if Wiseman was really born in 1625, then we shall be\r\njustified in assuming that he traveled with the prince at first simply\r\nas his companion and not in a professional capacity; and we shall be\r\nfurther justified in assuming that he acquired his medical and surgical\r\ntraining during his residence on the continent.\r\n\r\nIn 1650 Wiseman returned with the prince to Scotland. At the battle\r\nof Worcester he was taken prisoner by the Parliamentary army under\r\nCromwell and did not regain his liberty until 1652, at which time he\r\nsettled permanently in London. After the Restoration in 1660, his\r\npractice increased very greatly and, so far as one may judge from the\r\nlarge number of cases which he reports in his work on surgery that\r\nwas first published in 1676, it must have been very extensive and of\r\na most varied character. I have read many of these reports of cases\r\nthat occurred in Wiseman’s practice, and have been much impressed with\r\nthe thoroughly practical character of the treatment which he adopted\r\nin the majority of instances, and also with the very clear and concise\r\nmanner in which he narrates the attendant circumstances--the nature of\r\nthe malady or of the injuries received, the treatment which he adopted,\r\nand the final results attained. In the belief that they may furnish\r\ncorroborative evidence of the statements which I have just made, I now\r\ntake the liberty of reproducing here two of these reports of cases:--\r\n\r\n   (1) Whilst I was a prisoner at Chester (1651), after the battel\r\n   of Worcester, I was carried by Colonel Duckinfield’s order to a\r\n   man that out of much zeal to the Cause, pursuing our scattered\r\n   forces, was shot through the joint of the elbow; the bullet\r\n   entering in at the external part of the _os humeri_, and\r\n   passing out between the _ulna_ and _radius_. He had\r\n   been afflicted with great pain the space of six weeks. I found\r\n   the wound undigested,[96] and full of a loose, soft, white\r\n   flesh, the bones fractured, and not likely to unite, many\r\n   shivers lying included within the joints, and incapable of\r\n   being drawn out. The lower part of the arm was oedematous to\r\n   the fingers’ ends as full as the skin could well contain, and\r\n   the upper part was inflamed; also about the _os humeri_\r\n   and _axilla_ a perfect phlegmon was formed. The patient\r\n   thus tired with pain, desired to be cured or have his arm cut\r\n   off. To which purpose he had procured the Governor’s leave for\r\n   my staying with him. But, while that phlegmon was upon the\r\n   upper parts, there was no hope of a prosperous amputation, nor\r\n   of cure while those shivers of bone lay pricking the nervous\r\n   parts within the joint. The phlegmon was too forward for\r\n   repercussion,[97] and yet not likely to suppurate in less than\r\n   a week’s time. Wherefore I endeavored by emollients and some\r\n   discutients to succour the grieved shoulder and parts thereabout\r\n   by hindering the increase of the phlegmon, and to give some\r\n   perspiration to the part. Then with good fomentations I\r\n   corroborated the weak and oedematous member below; in which end\r\n   I also raised his hand nearer to his breast. Also by detergents\r\n   and bandage I disposed the wounds and fractured part to a better\r\n   condition, made way for discharge of matter, and endeavored to\r\n   extract the shivers of bones; then applied medicaments to remove\r\n   the _caries_. After some days the abscess suppurated in\r\n   the upper part of the shoulder and in the armpit; and while the\r\n   matter discharged from thence, the tumour discussed, and that\r\n   upper orifice cured soon after. But the continual pain in the\r\n   fractured joint kept that opening in the axilla from healing.\r\n   The patient growing weaker, and without hopes of cure, I was\r\n   necessitated to proceed to amputation. To which purpose I sent\r\n   to Chester to Mr. Murry, a knowing chirurgeon (since Mayor of\r\n   that city), to come with instruments and other necessaries,\r\n   whereby I might the better do the work. He accordingly came, and\r\n   we prepared dressings ready; which were stupes or pledgits of\r\n   fine short tow well worked, some like _splenia_ [bandages],\r\n   others were round, and bigger or less. We wetted them all in\r\n   oxycrate [water and vinegar], and dried them; et cetera....\r\n\r\n   The apparatus thus made, and the patient some while before\r\n   refreshed with a good draught of caudle [a hot drink made of\r\n   spiced and sugared wine], his friends took him out of his bed,\r\n   and placed him in a chair toward the light. One of his servants\r\n   held his arm; another of his friends held his other hand. Then\r\n   Mr. Murry drew up the skin and museulous flesh of the arm\r\n   towards the shoulder, whilst I made a strong bandage, some three\r\n   or four fingers’ breadth, above the affected part. Then with a\r\n   good knife I cut off the flesh by a quick turn of my hand, Mr.\r\n   M. pulling up the flesh, whilst I bared the bones.[98] After\r\n   which, with as few motions of my saw [as possible], I separated\r\n   the bone[s], the patient not so much as whimpering the while.\r\n   After this Mr. Murry thrusting his hands downwards with the\r\n   museulous flesh and skin which he had drawn upwards, I passed\r\n   a strong needle and thread through the middle of the flesh and\r\n   skin on both sides, within half an inch of the edges, and\r\n   brought the lips close within a narrow compass; and having tied\r\n   that ligature fast, and cut off the string, I passed the needle\r\n   again through the two contrary sides, which I tied as close;\r\n   then loosened the ligature above, and applied the little round\r\n   stupes of tow spread with a quantity of Galen’s powder mixed\r\n   with egg albumen. The long pledgits were applied from the middle\r\n   of the stump each way upwards along the arm, over which I put on\r\n   a bladder and a cross cloth, then rowled up the stump, and made\r\n   the bandage [pass] under his other arm and over his neck.... He\r\n   being thus dressed up, we put him into his bed. The third day\r\n   we took off his dressings, and found the stump well digested,\r\n   and at least two spoonfuls of matter discharged.... During which\r\n   the bone exfoliated, and the stump soon after cicatrized. Then\r\n   having procured a pass to come to London, I hastened away.\r\n\r\n   (2) A lady coming to town with a swelling in her left breast,\r\n   consulted some of our Profession, and at last me. She said she\r\n   had some years since kernels in her breast, which were judged\r\n   the “King’s Evil”; upon consideration of which she was presented\r\n   to His Majesty, and touched. In progress of time they swelled,\r\n   and her breast being extremely painful, she desired my judgment\r\n   of it. The swelling was large and round, and greatly inflamed,\r\n   under which it was soft and seemed to have matter in it. The\r\n   parts more distant were hard, and several tubercles lying\r\n   under the skin made it unequal; yet the breast was not fixed.\r\n   She urged me instantly to deliver my thoughts of it; which to\r\n   decline I turned from her, and told her friend it was a cancer,\r\n   and that I saw no hopes to save her life but by cutting it off.\r\n   He wished me to consider how I delivered such judgment of it,\r\n   two chirurgeons having lately assured her the contrary, they\r\n   taking it for a phlegmon. But I, not being used to guide my\r\n   judgment by what others delivered, confirmed to him what I had\r\n   before said by a sad prediction, which befel her in few weeks\r\n   after. And indeed there was no way then to deal with it but by\r\n   cutting off her breast.\r\n\r\nOne is not a little startled, after reading a number of case-histories\r\nlike the two which I have just reproduced, to discover other portions\r\nof text (Vol. I., pp. 384 and 385) which show clearly that Wiseman,\r\nalthough a surgeon of the most practical character and a man equipped\r\nwith excellent reasoning powers when he was placed in the presence\r\nof most of the problems which are constantly being submitted to\r\nphysicians for solution, was nevertheless the victim of a belief that\r\nsupernatural powers may reside in certain human beings. Speaking\r\nof the cure of the “King’s Evil”--also called by him “struma” and\r\n“scrofula”--Wiseman, in the chapter which he devotes to this subject,\r\nmakes the following statement:--\r\n\r\n   But when upon trial he (the chirurgeon) shall find the\r\n   contumaciousness of the disease, which frequently deluded his\r\n   best care and industry, he will find reason of acknowledging the\r\n   goodness of God; who hath dealt so bountifully with this Nation\r\n   in giving the Kings of it, at least from Edward the Confessor\r\n   downwards (if not for a longer time), an extraordinary power in\r\n   the miraculous cure thereof.... I myself have been a frequent\r\n   eye-witness of many hundreds of cures performed by his Majesty’s\r\n   touch alone, without any assistance of chirurgery; and those,\r\n   many of them, such as had tired out the endeavors of able\r\n   chirurgeons before they came thither.\r\n\r\nSome years before his death, which occurred in 1686, Wiseman was given\r\nthe title of Serjeant-Chirurgeon to King Charles the Second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\n        REFORMS INSTITUTED BY THE ITALIAN SURGEON MAGATI IN THE\r\n      TREATMENT OF WOUNDS.--FINAL ENDING OF THE FEUD BETWEEN THE\r\n     SURGEONS AND THE PHYSICIANS OF PARIS.--REVIVAL OF INTEREST IN\r\n                       THE SCIENCE OF OBSTETRICS\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reforms Instituted by Magati._--Cesare Magati, who was born in\r\n1579 at Scandiano, in the Duchy of Règgio, studied medicine at the\r\nUniversity of Bologna and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine\r\nfrom that institution in 1597. Immediately afterward he went to Rome\r\nand devoted himself particularly to the study of anatomy and surgery.\r\nThen, upon his return to his native land, he quickly acquired so great\r\na reputation as a surgeon that the Duke of Bentivoglio, who was a man\r\nof enlightened views and ambitious to promote in every possible way the\r\nbest interests of the University of Ferrara, offered Magati the Chair\r\nof Surgery in that institution. The offer was accepted in 1612, and\r\nMagati continued to hold the position for several years, his services\r\nbeing highly appreciated both by the authorities of the university and\r\nby the students. But, when his health began to break down,--he was\r\naffected with stone in the bladder,--he decided that his best course\r\nwas to resign his professorship, retire from active practice, and\r\nbecome a Capuchin monk. When he took this step he obtained permission\r\nfrom the head of the Chapter to which he belonged, to resume in a\r\nlimited measure the surgical work which he was so well fitted to do.\r\nBut in the year 1647 his sufferings became so acute that he was obliged\r\nto visit Bologna in the hope of obtaining relief through operative\r\ninterference. The operation, however, did not prove successful, and\r\ndeath occurred shortly afterward.\r\n\r\nMagati effected, in a quiet and unostentatious manner, a number of\r\ndesirable reforms in surgical procedures. Thus, for example, he pointed\r\nout how undesirable it is, in most cases, to change the dressings of\r\na wound so frequently as was, at that period, the common practice.\r\nThe process of cicatrization, he insisted, is not effected by the\r\nefforts of the surgeon, but is fundamentally the work of Nature. Then,\r\nin addition, he protested against the practice of introducing wicks\r\nand pledgets of lint into wounds. These criticisms and this advice,\r\nsays von Gurlt, had been given many times before by different ancient\r\nauthors, but they undoubtedly had to be repeated from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe treatise in which Magati has written these things bears the\r\nfollowing title: “_De rara medicatione vulnerum, seu de vulneribus\r\nraro tractandis, libri duo_,” Venice, 1616 and 1676; also Nuremberg,\r\n1733.\r\n\r\n_Final Extinguishment of the Long-standing Feud between the Surgeons\r\nand the Physicians in Paris._--At several points in the course of\r\nthis sketch of the history of medicine, I have called attention to the\r\nfact that, during the centuries preceding those which are reckoned by\r\ncertain authors as belonging to modern times, surgeons as a class were\r\ngenerally looked upon, especially in the larger cities of France, as\r\ndecidedly inferior to physicians. The first attempt at something like\r\nsystematic instruction in surgery was made by the Brotherhood of Saint\r\nCosmas and Saint Damian at Paris. This organization, which was founded\r\nby Jean Pitard about the middle of the thirteenth century, was composed\r\nof a group of barbers who felt a strong desire to secure for themselves\r\na better training than was obtainable by the generality of barbers in\r\nthose days. The latter were known as “surgeons of the short gown,”\r\nwhile the more ambitious men, who belonged to the group mentioned\r\nabove, were known as “surgeons of the long gown.” With the progress of\r\ntime this smaller group of barbers really succeeded in making better\r\nsurgeons of themselves, but in accomplishing this they intensified\r\nat the same time the jealousy which the physicians as a class felt\r\ntoward them, a jealousy which repeatedly manifested itself in the form\r\nof downright persecution. The data for a complete account of this\r\npersecution, that persisted through centuries, are lacking, and even\r\nif I possessed them I should not care to devote the time that would\r\nbe required for a proper presentation of the subject. It is pleasant,\r\nhowever, to be able to record the fact that these plucky barbers\r\nnever entirely lost courage, but fought on, year after year, until\r\nthey eventually succeeded--with the help of a strongly sympathetic\r\npublic--in making the St. Côme Medical School the nursery of some\r\nof the best surgeons in France during the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. It was here, for example, that Paré, Guillemeau, Thierry\r\nde Héry and other men of distinction obtained their early training,\r\nand it was doubtless through their influence that some of the wealthy\r\npatients whom they had treated successfully, were induced to contribute\r\nliberally to the support of the school. The final event in the history\r\nof this institution was the complete overthrow of the opposing\r\nphysicians and the merging of the two surgical schools--that of the\r\nregular Faculty and the St. Côme School--into one, under the direction\r\nof de Lapeyronie, of whom I shall now furnish a brief sketch.\r\n\r\n_François de Lapeyronie._--François de Lapeyronie was born at\r\nMontpellier on January 15, 1678, and he enjoyed the privilege of\r\nreceiving a most careful preliminary education. He was only seventeen\r\nyears of age when the academic degree which corresponds to our Master\r\nof Arts was bestowed upon him. As the next step he visited Paris for\r\nthe purpose of perfecting his knowledge of surgery, the branch of\r\nscience in which he was specially interested; and upon his return\r\nto Montpellier he began giving instruction in anatomy and surgery.\r\nIn a short time he was chosen Surgeon-in-Chief of the Montpellier\r\nHôtel-Dieu. In 1714 he was called to Paris to take charge of the Duc\r\nde Chaulnes, whose malady had not yielded to the treatment adopted\r\nby the surgeons of that city; and in this case the measures which he\r\nemployed proved so efficacious that de Lapeyronie decided to settle\r\npermanently in the metropolis. He taught anatomy in the Collège de\r\nSaint-Côme, and in a short time was chosen Head Surgeon of the Charité,\r\none of the largest hospitals of Paris. In 1731 he became one of the\r\nfounders of the Royal Academy of Surgery, and he took a most prominent\r\npart in the struggle which was then actively going on between the\r\nphysicians and surgeons of Paris,--one of the last and most serious\r\nof the attempts made by the former to render the surgeons subordinate\r\nto the physicians. The surgeons won the battle (April 23, 1743), and\r\nDezeimeris says that the part taken by de Lapeyronie in this struggle\r\nmay be looked upon as one of the most honorable achievements recorded\r\nin the history of medicine. De Lapeyronie died on April 25, 1747, after\r\na long and painful illness. In his will he made most liberal provision\r\nfor the promotion of medical science; establishing funds for the giving\r\nof annual prizes, for the founding of a medical library, for the\r\nbuilding of an anatomical amphitheatre, etc. In his treatise on anatomy\r\nHyrtl, the distinguished professor at the University of Vienna, makes\r\nthe following brief statement with reference to a certain dissecting\r\nroom in Paris, but he does not state in what part of the city the\r\nroom in question is located, nor does he mention any other facts that\r\nmight enable his readers to fix its location. In the absence of more\r\nprecise information concerning this matter, I shall take the liberty of\r\nsuggesting that Hyrtl’s discovery was made in the Anatomical Institute\r\nwhich de Lapeyronie founded. Hyrtl’s statement reads as follows:--\r\n\r\n   Over the entrance doorway of a dissecting room in Paris I read\r\n   this inscription: _Hic locus est ubi mors gaudet succurrere\r\n   vitae._ [Here is the spot where Death rejoices to render\r\n   assistance to Life.] No more beautiful or fitting words could\r\n   be employed for inspiring the student, upon his first entrance\r\n   into the room, with respect for the work in which he is about to\r\n   engage.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, a few pages beyond that on which the above statement is\r\nprinted, Hyrtl quotes Vicq d’Azyr as saying: “Among all the sciences\r\nanatomy is perhaps the one the usefulness of which has been most\r\nhighly lauded, but at the same time the one for which the least has\r\nbeen done to favor its advancement.”\r\n\r\n_The Revival of Interest in Obstetrics._--With Soranus, the\r\nearly Greek writer on obstetrics, this science seemed to come to\r\na standstill, and during all the intervening centuries, up to the\r\nsixteenth, not a single work of any special value was published on\r\nthis subject; for it is safe to say that nobody would claim for the\r\none or two obstetrical treatises that were written by teachers in\r\nthe Medical School of Salerno during the ninth or tenth century,\r\nthat they contributed materially to advance our knowledge in regard\r\nto this branch of medicine. It therefore seems fitting, as suggested\r\nby Haeser, that during the century which gave birth to such immortal\r\nworks as those of Vesalius and Paré, there should appear somebody who\r\npossessed the inclination to stir once more into life the dying embers\r\nof the science of midwifery; and such a man was found in the person of\r\nEucharius Roesslin, the elder, more commonly known--says Dezeimeris--by\r\nthe Greek name of “Rhodion.” He lived during the first half of the\r\nsixteenth century, his death occurring about the year 1526, and his\r\nwas the first modern treatise especially devoted to obstetrics. He\r\nbegan the practice of medicine in the city of Worms, in the central\r\npart of Germany, and then moved to Frankfort-on-the-Main, where he\r\nfilled the salaried office of City Physician. Midwifery, at that time,\r\nwas left entirely in the hands of ignorant old women; and it was only\r\nin response to the wishes of Catherine, the Duchess of Brunswick and\r\nLüneberg, that Rhodion undertook to prepare a manual from which these\r\nignorant and careless women might learn to conduct their midwifery work\r\nin a more efficient, safe and acceptable manner. This little treatise,\r\nwhich was first published at Worms in 1513, passed through a number\r\nof editions and was translated into Latin, French, Dutch and English.\r\nVon Siebold says that Rhodion compiled its text from various ancient\r\nsources, and added practically nothing from his own experience. The\r\nwoodcuts, which are supposed to represent the different positions of\r\nthe foetus in the uterus, are not at all in accordance with the truth,\r\nand show the most marvelous products of the artist’s fancy. Von Siebold\r\nstates, however, that the prejudices which at that time existed in the\r\nminds of the people against the slightest participation of males in the\r\noperations of midwifery were so strong that Rhodion would not have been\r\npermitted to do anything toward learning the truth by the employment of\r\ndirect observation and careful examination--the only possible way in\r\nwhich the actual facts might have been learned.\r\n\r\nRhodion’s book, notwithstanding the defects to which I have just\r\nreferred, accomplished much good. It also restored the operation of\r\npodalic version to the position which it deserved, and it improved\r\nthe service of the midwives,--which was what the Duchess chiefly\r\ndesired,--and it undoubtedly emphasized the fact that the time had\r\narrived when obstetrics should receive the same degree of scientific\r\nstudy that was being bestowed on all the other departments of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe title of Rhodion’s (or Roesslin’s) little book reveals the fact\r\nthat he possessed no small degree of humor. It reads: “Garden of Roses\r\nfor Pregnant Women and for Midwives,” Worms, 1513.\r\n\r\n_The Operation Known as Caesarian Section._--The following\r\nstatements relating to the operation known as “Caesarian section”\r\nhave been compiled from Haeser’s _Geschichte der Medizin_:--This\r\noperation, which owes its name to the erroneous idea that Caesar\r\nwas brought into the world by its aid, is commonly believed to have\r\nbeen practiced on different occasions throughout antiquity, but\r\nthere has not yet been found in the records of history any account\r\nwhich shows clearly that the operation was performed upon a living\r\nwoman, and also that the incision extended not merely through the\r\nabdominal integuments, but also through the actual uterine wall. At\r\nSiegershausen, in Switzerland,--according to the report of Caspar\r\nBauhin in the treatise (“_Gynaecia_”) which he published at Basel\r\nin 1586,--a man named Jacob Nufer performed (about 1500) what was\r\nbelieved to be a Caesarian section on his own wife, and delivered a\r\nliving child. Both mother and child did well; the child growing up\r\nto the age of seventy-seven and the mother giving birth to living\r\nchildren, _per vias naturales_, several times afterward. In this\r\ninstance it is generally believed that the case was one of abdominal\r\npregnancy and that the wall of the uterus had not been incised.\r\n\r\nThe first separate treatise on Caesarian section was written by\r\nFrançois Rousset, and in it are reported several cases in which the\r\noperation was said to have been performed successfully. But both von\r\nSiebold and Kurt Sprengel do not seem willing to accept these reports\r\nas genuine, and we are therefore compelled to assume that the first\r\ntrustworthy account of a Caesarian section successfully performed by\r\na Dr. Trautmann of Wittenberg (in 1610) is that given by Sennert in a\r\ncommunication which was printed early in the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n_Invention of the Obstetrical Forceps._--After the publication of\r\nRoesslin’s “Garden of Roses,” the book of which I gave a brief sketch\r\non a previous page, nothing worthy of special note was done for a\r\nperiod of several years to advance the existing knowledge of midwifery\r\nor even to systematize that which had already accumulated. Then there\r\nbegan to appear evidences of an awakening among those physicians who\r\nrecognized the importance of this department of medical science, and as\r\na result there were soon placed upon record accounts of two or three\r\nadvances of real and permanent value. One of the first of these gains,\r\nfor example, was the revival and general acceptance of the practice of\r\npodalic version, or version by internal manipulations,--that is, the\r\noperation of changing the faulty position of the foetus _in utero_\r\nin such a manner that the feet shall be the parts which protrude into\r\nthe vagina. Podalic version--as it appears from the account given by\r\nvon Siebold--was known to the ancients, both Celsus and Aëtius having\r\ndescribed it in their treatises, but it was afterward forgotten or\r\nneglected until Ambroise Paré, in 1550, again recommended it in one of\r\nhis writings. At the same time Paré states, at the very beginning of\r\nhis monograph on this subject, that his colleagues, Thierry de Héry\r\nand Nicole Lambert, had both of them already carried out the method in\r\ncertain cases. This fact, however, does not detract from the credit due\r\nParé for having been the first, after the lapse of several centuries,\r\nto bring the operation to the knowledge of the medical profession; and\r\nfrom that day to the present it has held a fixed place in the science\r\nof obstetrics. As will be readily understood, this is not the proper\r\nplace in which to furnish details with regard to the operation itself.\r\nWhen Paré was asked whether it would be permissible for the midwives\r\nto undertake this operation of podalic version, he replied that it\r\nwould be, provided the individual who assumed this responsibility\r\nfelt convinced that she possessed the requisite degree of skill\r\nand experience in work of this nature, and provided also that--as\r\nsoon as she began to suspect her inability to finish the operation\r\nsuccessfully--she would promptly call to her aid a skilful surgeon, one\r\nwho had acquired considerable experience in obstetrical operations.\r\nParé’s favorite pupil, Jacques Guillemeau (1550–1630), a native of\r\nOrleans, France, made several important additions to our knowledge of\r\nthe operation of podalic version, and he was also in other respects an\r\nimportant promoter of the science of operative obstetrics. His treatise\r\non this branch of practical medicine, which was originally written in\r\nFrench and published at Paris in 1609, was soon translated into English\r\n(“Childbirth, the Happy Deliverance of Women,” London, 1612). In the\r\nopinion of von Siebold, podalic version may justly be considered the\r\nmost important contribution that was made to obstetrical science during\r\nthe sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nOne of the French midwives of this period, Louise Bourgeois (or\r\nBoursier), attained considerable celebrity by the excellence of the\r\ntreatise which she wrote on obstetrics. She was born at Paris about\r\nthe year 1564. In 1588 she began to fit herself for the career of\r\nmidwife, and in the course of a few years, after passing successfully\r\nthe required examinations, she was admitted by the authorities as a\r\n“sworn midwife” of the city of Paris. She gained steadily in experience\r\nand public favor, and the record states that already as early as 1601\r\nshe had the good fortune to officiate at the delivery of Henry the\r\nFourth’s wife (Marie de Medicis) of a son--the Dauphin (later, Louis\r\nthe Thirteenth). Her royal patrons were much pleased with the services\r\nwhich she rendered on this occasion, and, as a further evidence of\r\nthe confidence which she inspired, they asked her--as each of these\r\noccasions approached--to preside at the births of five other children.\r\n\r\nOne of the meritorious features of the treatise which Louise Bourgeois\r\nwrote,[99] says von Siebold, is to be found in the fact that she\r\nchampioned most earnestly podalic version. The book was translated into\r\nboth German (1644) and Dutch (1658).\r\n\r\nFrançois Mauriceau (1637–1709), who was indisputably the most\r\ndistinguished writer on obstetrics of the seventeenth century, was\r\nborn in Paris. During the early part of his career he was simply a\r\ngeneral surgeon, but, after the lapse of a few years, he gave up all\r\nhis other work and confined himself strictly to midwifery. For quite a\r\nlong period he held the position of Chief Obstetrician at Hôtel-Dieu,\r\nand at the same time he conducted an extensive private practice in\r\ncases of confinement. Worn out by the excessive amount of work which he\r\nperformed during the most active period of his career, he was finally\r\nobliged to retire from practice several years before his death.\r\n\r\nMauriceau did not invent any remarkable obstetric instruments or\r\nprocedures, but he was the first to set forth in clear and precise\r\nterms the principles of this science and art and to expound the rules\r\nrequired for putting them into practice. The titles of his two most\r\ncelebrated treatises are the following: “_Traité des maladies des\r\nfemmes grosses_,” Paris, 1668; and “_Observations sur la grossesse\r\net l’accouchement_,” Paris, 1695. In 1706, three years before his\r\ndeath, he also published “_Dernières observations sur les maladies\r\ndes femmes grosses_.”\r\n\r\nThe first of the three books mentioned passed through five editions\r\nduring Mauriceau’s lifetime, and there were two reprintings after his\r\ndeath. A noticeable feature of the work, says von Siebold, is the care\r\nwhich the author takes to preface all his lectures with a detailed\r\nexposition of the anatomical relations of the region concerning which\r\nhe is about to speak; and this custom, which he was the first to\r\nintroduce, has since then been followed by the great majority of those\r\nwho have written on the subject of midwifery.\r\n\r\nIn the book which hears the title “_Observations sur la grossesse,\r\netc._,” Mauriceau gives an account of his first and only interview\r\nwith the English obstetrician, Hugh Chamberlen, to whom is commonly\r\naccorded the credit of having invented the first pattern of the\r\nobstetric forceps. From this account it appears that on August 19,\r\n1670, Mauriceau was called to see a primiparous woman, thirty-eight\r\nyears old, who had already been in labor for several days, but\r\nwho had not yet been able, owing to the extreme narrowness of her\r\npelvis, to give birth to her child. (The case was one of head\r\npresentation.) As Mauriceau was not at all willing to perform a\r\nCaesarian section,--which alone, as he believed, promised a way out\r\nof the difficulty,--Chamberlen, who happened to be in Paris at that\r\nmoment, was asked to see the patient. He came at once, made a hasty\r\nexamination, and declared that he needed only six or seven minutes for\r\neffecting, by means of the method which he had invented, the delivery.\r\nThe patient was placed under his charge and he proceeded to apply his\r\nmethod. Instead of a few minutes, he spent three hours in the attempt\r\nto accomplish this purpose, but without success; and then admitted\r\nthat it was impossible, in this particular case, to effect delivery.\r\nAt the end of twenty-four hours the woman was dead. A postmortem\r\nexamination revealed the fact that the uterus was torn in several\r\nplaces and perforated at one spot, all of which lesions had evidently\r\nbeen produced by the instrument or instruments employed by Chamberlen.\r\n“To complete this story,” adds Mauriceau, “it should be remembered\r\nthat, six months before the occurrence of the events just narrated,\r\nthis physician had come to Paris from England, and boasted that he\r\npossessed a secret method by means of which he could, even in the most\r\ndesperate cases of labor, promptly effect the delivery of the child,\r\nand had told the King’s Physician-in-Ordinary that he would sell the\r\nknowledge of this secret for the sum of 10,000 Thalers (about $7500).”\r\n\r\nOne naturally hesitates about giving any measure of credit to a\r\nphysician whose professional conduct, as revealed in his relations to\r\nMauriceau’s patient, is clearly that of a charlatan. At the same time\r\nwe are obliged to bear in mind that in 1670 it was still possible for\r\na physician or surgeon to own a secret method of treatment and yet not\r\nforfeit all consideration on the part of his professional brethren.\r\nBut at no time in the history of medicine has such conduct as that\r\nattributed to Hugh Chamberlen (apart from the question of ownership\r\nof a secret process) been considered otherwise than reprehensible.\r\nHowever, as there does not appear to have been an earlier claimant for\r\nthe honor of having invented the obstetric forceps,--crude as it must\r\nhave been in its first form,--it seems only fair that Chamberlen should\r\nbe granted undisputed possession of this honor. During the eighteenth\r\ncentury--a period with which the present volume has no concern--the\r\nobstetric forceps underwent many alterations, and finally was given, by\r\nLevret and Baudelocque in France, by Smellie in England, and possibly\r\nalso by Palfyn in Holland, practically the form which it possesses\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nBefore I finally dismiss the allied topics of obstetrics and\r\ngynaecology, it seems desirable that I should add a few remarks\r\nconcerning two French surgeons who attained considerable eminence in\r\nthis special field, viz., Portal and Dionis.\r\n\r\n_Paul Portal._--Paul Portal, a native of Montpellier, France, was\r\na contemporary of Mauriceau and an excellent obstetrician. He received\r\nhis training under the best teachers at Paris, and more particularly\r\nunder the guidance of René Moreau, Dean of the Paris Faculty of\r\nMedicine (1630 and 1631) and Royal Professor of Medicine and Surgery.\r\nHe died in 1703. In the treatise which he published at Paris in 1685\r\n(“_La pratique des accouchements, etc._”) he lays down very\r\nstrongly the maxim that the surgeon or the midwife who has charge of\r\na case of labor should make no attempt to accelerate the efforts of\r\nNature until it becomes plainly evident that artificial assistance is\r\nabsolutely necessary. Portal cultivated the art of digital exploration\r\nto a very high degree of excellence. In Chapter VI., according to von\r\nSiebold, he expounds with great clearness the dangers which result from\r\na prolapse of the umbilical cord. When this condition is discovered, no\r\ntime should be lost in delivering the child. “In narrating some of his\r\nmost remarkable cases Portal uses very simple and clear language, and\r\nhe puts on record many things which in later years have been published\r\nas entirely new discoveries. But, unfortunately, his immediate\r\nsuccessors were not disposed to profit from Portal’s admirable\r\nteachings.” (Von Siebold.) The only translations of his treatise into\r\nforeign languages that have been published are one in Dutch (1690) and\r\nanother in Swedish by Van Hoorn (1723).\r\n\r\n_Pierre Dionis._--Pierre Dionis, who was born at Paris in the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth century, was in some degree related to\r\nMauriceau, the famous Parisian accoucheur. In 1673 he was appointed\r\nRoyal Demonstrator of Anatomy and Surgery at the institution known\r\nas the “_Jardin-du-Roi_,” and from this date onward, up to\r\nthe year 1680, he gave instruction regularly in these branches of\r\nmedical knowledge to large classes of students. He was particularly\r\ndistinguished for the clear and methodical manner in which he handled\r\nthe subjects upon which he lectured. In the year last mentioned he was\r\ncalled to Vienna to fill the position of Physician-in-Ordinary to Maria\r\nTheresa, Empress of Austria, but von Siebold, who is my authority for\r\nthe present sketch, does not say for what length of time he continued\r\nto hold this position. His death occurred in 1718.\r\n\r\nThe earliest work published by Dionis bears the title: “_Histoire\r\nanatomique d’une matrice extraordinaire_,” Paris, 1685. (Description\r\nof a case of extra-uterine pregnancy.) Five years later he published\r\nthe treatise on human anatomy (“_L’anatomie de l’homme, etc._,”\r\nParis, 1690) upon which his celebrity largely rests. This book passed\r\nthrough numerous editions and was translated into Latin, Dutch and\r\nEnglish (1723), and also Chinese; this last piece of work being\r\ndone by the Jesuit missionary, Father Parrenin, at the request of\r\nCam-Hi, Emperor of China, who died in 1723. Another treatise, which\r\nperhaps contributed, even more than did his Anatomy, to render Dionis\r\ncelebrated, is that which bears the title: “_Cours d’opérations de\r\nchirurgie démontrées au Jardin-du-Roi_,” Paris, 1707; and later\r\ntranslations into German, Dutch and English. This book covers the\r\nentire field of operative surgery, and its subject-matter is most\r\nmethodically arranged. It contains a large number of precepts which\r\nare as sound to-day as they were two hundred years ago. From the\r\nfrequent mention which Dionis makes of the diseases to which the teeth\r\nare liable, and from his descriptions of the operations that may be\r\nperformed for the cure or relief of these disorders, one is justified\r\nin drawing the conclusion that, at that early period, this branch of\r\nsurgery was not, as many suppose, abandoned entirely to charlatans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\n       THE FIRST APPEARANCE OF SYPHILIS IN EUROPE AS AN EPIDEMIC\r\n       DISEASE.--MEDICAL JOURNALISM.--THE BEGINNINGS OF A MODERN\r\n                PHARMACOPOEIA.--ITINERANT LITHOTOMISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the end of the fifteenth and during the early part of the\r\nsixteenth centuries accounts concerning syphilis began to be published\r\nin the medical literature of Spain, Italy and France. The word\r\n“syphilis,” it is true, does not appear in any of these records, for\r\nit had not yet been coined; but the accounts themselves leave no room\r\nfor doubt that this was the disease to which the authors of these\r\nrecords referred. The prevailing views with regard to the origin and\r\nnature of syphilis differed somewhat in the three countries named. In\r\nSpain, for example, it was a common belief that the disease originated\r\nin an unfavorable conjunction of the stars[100] and yet at the same\r\ntime it was generally admitted that it was a disease which belonged\r\nin the category of luxuries and might be avoided if one were careful\r\nnot to have intercourse with dissolute women. For a brief period of\r\ntime there were physicians in all three of the Latin countries who\r\nmaintained that syphilis had been imported, in the first instance,\r\nfrom America by the men who made the voyage with Columbus and by the\r\nearliest Spanish explorers of South America; but it was soon shown\r\nthat this theory was not compatible with certain known facts--such,\r\nfor example, as the published reports made by the Spanish physicians\r\nPintor and Torrella,[101] who describe cases of syphilis which they had\r\ntreated prior to 1493 (the year in which the first discoverers returned\r\nfrom America). In Italy, according to Giovanni da Vigo, the author\r\nof an excellent treatise on surgery (“_Practica in arte chirurgica\r\ncopiosa_,” Rome, 1514), the disease was first observed in Europe in\r\nDecember, 1494, soon after the arrival of Charles the Eighth’s (France)\r\narmy at Naples; and only a short time elapsed before there developed,\r\nas a result of this great accession of French soldiers, a veritable\r\nepidemic of what then began to be known quite generally as “_morbus\r\ngallicus_” or “the French disease.” The King himself, it is stated,\r\nwas among the number of those who contracted the infection.\r\n\r\nSo far as I am able to discover, the term “syphilis” was first\r\nintroduced into medical literature by Fracastoro, the distinguished\r\nphysician of Verona, who published in 1530 a Latin poem bearing the\r\ntitle: “_Syphilis sive morbus gallicus_.” These verses were\r\nreceived everywhere with great favor, were translated into several\r\nmodern languages, and speedily put an end forever to the employment of\r\nthe insulting term “_morbus gallicus_.”\r\n\r\nA few more words with reference to the origin and distribution of\r\nsyphilis throughout the world may not seem inappropriate in this\r\nplace. J. K. Proksch, the author of the most recent history of this\r\ndisease,[102] says it has been fully proved that syphilis existed among\r\nthe inhabitants of India as long ago as during the Middle Ages, and he\r\nadds that the evidence thus far collected justifies the further belief\r\nthat it was not an uncommon malady among the ancient Greeks and Romans,\r\nand even among the Babylonians and Assyrians. Doubtless a good deal\r\nof what was called “leprosy” in early times was in reality syphilis.\r\nAnother syphilographer--Raphael Finckenstein--makes the following\r\nsensible remarks about the efforts that have been made to ascertain\r\nthe precise date when this disease first appeared in Europe:--[103]\r\n\r\n   It is just as foolish to suppose that the date of the first\r\n   appearance of syphilis may be discovered as it is to hope\r\n   that the disease will ever entirely disappear. As long as\r\n   wealth and idleness continue to exist, as long as there are\r\n   men who remain unmarried and women whose moral character is of\r\n   a yielding nature, and as long as it is not possible for the\r\n   police to creep into every nook and corner, just so long will\r\n   licentiousness and indulgence in fleshly lusts continue to\r\n   disturb the peace of the community. These are the conditions\r\n   necessary to the development and spread of syphilis.\r\n\r\nSome account of the treatment of this form of venereal disease comes\r\nnext in order. It is commonly believed, says the author just quoted,\r\nthat it was from the Spanish physicians of the sixteenth century\r\nthat we learned how to treat syphilis by the methodical employment\r\nof mercurial preparations. (See footnote at the bottom of page 542.)\r\nHe adds that there was published by Juan Almenar at Venice, in 1502,\r\na book which bears the title: “A treatise on the Morbus Gallicus,\r\nin which it is demonstrated how the patient may be treated in such\r\na successful manner that the disease will never return, nor will\r\nany objectionable lesions develop in the mouth; and yet, during the\r\nprogress of the treatment, the patient is not required to remain\r\nin bed.” The author of this book, who was a resident of Valencia,\r\nSpain, was a man of noble birth. His treatise passed through eight\r\nsuccessive editions, the last of which was printed at Basel in 1536.\r\nAlmenar’s plan of treatment was to employ mercurial inunctions in such\r\nmoderate doses as not to induce salivation. If, at the end of a few\r\ndays, he saw evidences of an approach of this symptom, he substituted\r\nbaths and evacuant remedies (rhubarb and senna) for a short time,\r\nand also prescribed a more nourishing diet and the taking of various\r\ninternal remedies. Then, later, the inunctions were resumed. The\r\nexact duration of such a course of treatment is not stated. So far as\r\nI am able to judge from the account given by Finckenstein, Almenar\r\nfound it necessary in some cases to repeat the series of mercurial\r\ninunctions as many as four times. His aim, in other words, was to\r\naccomplish a radical cure of the disease, whereas his contemporaries,\r\nwho were mainly ignorant and uneducated physicians, were satisfied to\r\ncarry out a purely symptomatic treatment. Morejon, the historian of\r\nSpanish medicine, expresses the belief that Almenar was the first to\r\nuse steam baths in the treatment of syphilis. Both Hensler and Simon,\r\nthe best modern authorities with regard to the history of syphilis,\r\nagree that Almenar’s inunction method of treating this disease forms,\r\nnotwithstanding its crudeness in certain respects, the basis of all\r\nmodern methods of the same general character. Unfortunately, the\r\nphysicians of a later period did not follow the relatively mild and\r\nsafe inunction method advocated by Almenar, but so modified it for the\r\nworse that it became a common thing for men to say that the cure was\r\nworse than the disease.\r\n\r\n_A Few Special Advances Worthy of Note._--The beginnings of\r\nmedical journalism belong to the second half of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. In 1665, for example, there appeared for the first time,\r\na medical article in the “_Journal des Scavans_,” and during\r\nthe same year similar articles were printed in the “Philosophical\r\nTransactions of the Royal Society of London.” According to August\r\nHirsch the earliest periodical that was devoted entirely to the\r\ninterests of the medical profession was the “_Journal des découvertes\r\nen médecine_,” which was first published in 1679 and continued,\r\nin 1680, under the title of “_Le Temple d’Esculape_.” Then\r\nfollowed soon afterward: “_Le Journal des Nouvelles Découvertes en\r\nMédecine_” (1681–1683); “_Le Mercure Savant_” (1684); “_Le\r\nZodiacus Medico-Gallicus_” (1680–1685), which was published in Latin\r\nin Geneva, by Bonet; etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the more important advances in anatomy and physiology\r\nthat have already been mentioned on previous pages, the following\r\ndeserve to receive at least a passing notice: In the department\r\nof anatomy and physiology, William Briggs (1642–1704), one of the\r\nphysicians of St. Thomas’ Hospital, London, published at Cambridge in\r\n1676, under the title of “_Ophthalmographia_,” a most important\r\ncontribution to the anatomy and physiology of the eye; and there were\r\nfour other English anatomists who, during the seventeenth century,\r\ngained well-merited credit by the original work which they did in the\r\nfields of anatomy and physiology--viz., Thomas Willis (1622–1675),\r\nFrancis Glisson (1597–1677), Thomas Wharton (1610–1673), and Nathaniel\r\nHighmore (1613–1684). The part played by Germany in these gains in\r\nanatomy and physiology, during the period now under consideration, was\r\nchiefly that of a sympathetic recipient; for the political conditions\r\nat that time were entirely unfavorable to any active participation on\r\nthe part of the physicians of that country. Early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury, however, they began in earnest to do their share of work in\r\nadvancing the science of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe relationship of the physical sciences to the theory and practice\r\nof medicine is not of an intimate nature, and it will therefore not\r\nbe necessary for me to do more than briefly to enumerate the more\r\nimportant of the discoveries of this character which occurred during\r\nthe sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\nGalileo (1564–1642), a native of Pisa, Italy, was the creator of the\r\nscience of motion, and he gave the first satisfactory demonstration\r\nof equilibrium on an inclined plane. He devised an imperfect\r\nspecies of thermometer, a proportional compass, and the refracting\r\ntelescope, by means of which latter instrument he made a number of\r\nother important discoveries in the domain of astronomy. His pupil,\r\nEvangelista Torricelli (1608–1647), also a native of Italy, discovered\r\nthe barometer, and in addition arrived at many fundamental truths\r\nin mechanics and hydrostatics. Otto von Guericke (1602–1686), a\r\nnative of Magdeburg, Germany, invented the air pump. Sir Isaac Newton\r\n(1642–1727), born at Woolsthorpe, Lincolnshire, one of the world’s\r\ngreatest authorities in natural philosophy, was the first to formulate\r\nclearly the law of gravitation. Edme Mariotte (1620–1684), a native\r\nof Burgundy, France, was the discoverer of what is commonly known as\r\n“Mariotte’s law”--_i.e._, a law of elastic fluids, according to\r\nwhich the elastic force is exactly in the inverse proportion of the\r\nspace which the mass of fluid occupies. He also discovered that the\r\npart of the retina at which it meets the optic nerve is not capable of\r\nconveying the impression of sight. Finally, Denis Papin (1647–1710),\r\na Frenchman, invented the first steam engine, of an embryonic and not\r\nvery practical type; for in this apparatus the piston floated on the\r\nwater in a separate cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe inventions which I have here briefly enumerated represent the more\r\nimportant discoveries that were made in physical science during the\r\nsixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\n\r\n_The Beginnings of a Modern Pharmacopoeia, and One of the Last\r\nAttempts of the Disciples of Galen to Maintain Their Ascendancy in\r\nTherapeutics._--In the domain of pharmacology the first attempt in\r\nmodern times to organize this department of practical medicine was\r\nmade by an apothecary in Barcelona in 1497, and was published by him\r\nin printed form in 1521. (Von Gurlt.) This pharmacopoeia was doubtless\r\nwholly unknown beyond the borders of Spain. Not far from one hundred\r\nyears later,--_i.e._, in the early part of the seventeenth\r\ncentury,--Theodore Turquet de Mayerne, who was born in 1573, in a\r\nsmall village near the city of Geneva, made the second attempt in\r\nmodern times to organize the pharmacological department of practical\r\nmedicine. After showing quite early in life a fondness for the study\r\nof chemistry, he devoted himself particularly to the investigation\r\nof the remedies that are produced in the chemist’s laboratory; the\r\npreparations of antimony attracting his especial interest. A little\r\nbefore this time the physicians of Paris were split up into two\r\nstrongly antagonistic parties as regards the propriety of administering\r\nthis metal in any form as a remedy; but those who opposed its\r\ntherapeutic employment finally managed to secure from Parliament, in\r\n1566, a decree prohibiting its use. While this quarrel was in progress,\r\nde Mayerne visited Paris (1602) and established himself in that city\r\nas an independent lecturer on chemistry. As the regular faculty still\r\nheld the belief that the teachings of Galen were the only safe guide\r\nfor physicians to follow, de Mayerne’s action must have appeared to\r\nthem like an impudent challenge. In one of his writings he strongly\r\nrecommended the employment of antimonial preparations,--remedies\r\nintroduced originally by the much-hated Paracelsus,--and he even\r\nwent so far as to offer some for sale. This was too much for the\r\ndisciples of Galen to bear without a protest, and consequently in\r\n1603 the Parliament issued a new decree, in accordance with which de\r\nMayerne was prohibited from practicing medicine in Paris. This measure\r\nappears to have proved successful in putting a stop effectively to\r\nhis obnoxious teachings, for we learn that shortly afterward he was\r\nknown to be living in London, where, in 1611, he was appointed the\r\nPhysician-in-Ordinary to King James the First, and later to Charles the\r\nFirst. He died in 1655.\r\n\r\nJean Astruc, the distinguished French medical author of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, speaks rather disparagingly of de Mayerne’s attempt to\r\norganize a pharmacopoeia. An earlier, more successful, and much\r\nmore creditable attempt of this nature was made by Valerius Cordus,\r\nwhose “_Dispensatorium pharmacorum omnium_” was first published\r\nat Nürnberg in 1535. This work, which subsequently bore the title\r\n“_Pharmacopoeia Augustana_,” up to the year 1627 passed through\r\nat least seven editions and was utilized to a greater or less extent\r\nby the authors or editors of nearly all later pharmacopoeias. To\r\ngo still further back, the most ancient pharmacopoeia of which we\r\nhave any knowledge is that which bears the title of “_Antidotarium\r\nNicolai_,” the author of which work was Nicolaus, the President or\r\nDean of the Medical School at Salerno. The book was written originally\r\nduring the first half of the twelfth century, but it did not appear in\r\nprint, at Venice, until the year 1471, and then only in an incomplete\r\nform. Quite recently a French translation of the book has been\r\nmade and published (1896) by Paul Dorveaux, of the Paris School of\r\nPharmacy. Most of the preparations there described have long since been\r\nabandoned, but a few of them--such, for example, as citrine ointment,\r\nhoney of roses, oxymel, and oil of roses--are still to be found in the\r\npharmacopoeias of some nations.\r\n\r\n_Itinerant Lithotomists._--For an unknown number of years\r\npreceding the sixteenth century it had been a well-established custom\r\nfor members of the medical profession in France, and also, doubtless,\r\nin neighboring countries, to intrust--as the Hippocratic oath\r\nenjoined--all cases of stone in the bladder to expert lithotomists.\r\nSuch special knowledge and skill were not easily acquired, and so it\r\ncame about that there were very few individuals who were acknowledged\r\nto be experts and who were really capable of teaching the art, and\r\nthese few guarded most carefully the knowledge which they had gained.\r\nDuring the period of time which we are now considering, certain\r\nmembers of the Collot and Pineau families were the most distinguished\r\nlithotomists in France, and the records show that in the year 1600\r\nJehan Paradis and Nicolas Serre petitioned the Government for official\r\nrecognition of their special rights to enjoy a monopoly of operative\r\nwork of this character. “We ask that you give orders that all poor\r\npatients who may apply to Hôtel-Dieu (the great city hospital of Paris)\r\nor to the Bureau-of-the-Poor for relief from stone in the bladder, be\r\nturned over to our care for proper treatment. The poor will receive\r\nthis treatment gratis, and those who can afford to pay will be charged\r\na very reasonable fee. And you will do well if you prohibit all other\r\npersons from meddling with such cases in any manner.” In a document\r\nbearing the date 1646 mention is made of four lithotomists--Philippe\r\nand Charles Collot, Jacques Girault and Antoine Ruffin--who had erected\r\nin the Faubourg Saint-Antoine, Paris, a building which was intended\r\nto serve as a hospital “in which, at any time during the entire year,\r\nthose who are afflicted with stone in the bladder may be lodged, fed,\r\nnursed and subjected to proper treatment,--the poor without charge of\r\nany kind, and the well-to-do at a proper rate of remuneration.”\r\n\r\nIn Franco’s time (middle of the sixteenth century) cutting for stone\r\nin the bladder was by no means an uncommon operation, and was almost\r\nalways performed by itinerant lithotomists (“_inciseurs_”). The\r\nCollots had, for many years, possessed almost a monopoly of this\r\nbusiness. Laurent Collot, who was the first one of the family to engage\r\nin the work, was Royal Lithotomist in 1556, and handed down to his son\r\nall the knowledge on this subject which he had acquired through long\r\nexperience. François Tolet was another of these popular lithotomists\r\nwho flourished in Paris during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\r\nHe died in 1724 at the age of seventy-seven. His treatise on lithotomy,\r\nwhich was published in Paris in 1681, and subsequently passed through\r\nseveral editions, is said by Dezeimeris to contain the records of a\r\nlarge number of his own cases and to show clearly that he was a surgeon\r\nof sound judgment. No better treatise on this subject, he adds, was\r\npublished during that period of the history of medicine.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those whom I have just mentioned there were two French\r\nmonks who gained wide celebrity as operators for stone in the bladder,\r\nviz., Frère Jacques de Beaulieu and Frère Côme. The last-named belongs\r\nto the early part of the eighteenth century, and should therefore--in\r\naccordance with the plan which I have been following--not receive\r\nconsideration in the present account; but, in view of the fact that\r\nthese are the only two monks who, during the Renaissance and the period\r\nimmediately following, gained conspicuous credit for the honorable and\r\nefficient service which they rendered, not merely to the science of\r\nmedicine but also to the cause of humanity, I believe that I cannot do\r\nbetter than to place the two sketches together as if they both belonged\r\nstrictly to one and the same period of time.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 26. FRÈRE JACQUES DE BEAULIEU.\r\n\r\n  Born in 1651 in the village of Létendonne, Franche-Comté, France.\r\n\r\n  (From the steel engraving in the treatise _De la Taille\r\n  Latérale par le Périnée_, etc., by Pascal Baseilhac, nephew\r\n  of Frère Côme, Paris, 1804.)]\r\n\r\n(_a_) Frère Jacques--or Brother James, who was born in 1561 at the\r\nvillage of Létendonne, near Lons-le-Saulnier, Central France,--learned\r\nthe art of operating for stone in the bladder from an Italian surgeon\r\nnamed Paulony, and acted as his assistant or associate up to the time\r\nwhen he became a monk of the Order of Saint Francis--that is, of that\r\nbranch of the Order which had its chapter house at Feuillants in\r\nLanguedoc. He traveled about the country offering to treat gratuitously\r\nall persons affected with stone in the bladder who were willing to\r\ntrust him, and he made it a rule, whenever such a thing was possible,\r\nalways to operate in the presence of one or more physicians or\r\nsurgeons. He was also ready at all times to give instruction to those\r\nwho wished to learn his method of procedure. He never asked to be\r\nremunerated, but was always pleased to receive from his patients a\r\nwritten testimonial of what he had done for them. Out of the moneys\r\nwhich he received from the rich he retained only that which he required\r\nfor his own support and for the purchase of such instruments as he from\r\ntime to time required; the balance he distributed among the poor. He\r\nwas very faithful in performing his religious duties, and he succeeded\r\nin gaining the good will and esteem of everybody with whom he had any\r\ndealings.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it was customary in France to credit Frère Jacques\r\n(Fig. 26) with the invention of the lateral method of operating for\r\nstone in the bladder. This, however, was an error, for Franco, on page\r\n95 of E. Nicaise’s reproduction of the 1561 edition, describes this\r\noperation clearly. It must therefore have been invented a long time\r\nbefore Frère Jacques was born. The text (rendered into English) reads\r\nas follows: “... the incision should be made between the anus and the\r\ntesticles, two or three finger-breadths to one side of the commissure\r\nor perinaeum [median line of the perinaeum].” This is said to be the\r\nearliest clear description of the first step of the lateral operation\r\nof which we have any knowledge.\r\n\r\nIn 1697, when Frère Jacques visited Paris, he had already attained\r\nwide celebrity as a lithotomist; the number of his successful\r\noperations--all of which had been performed according to the lateral\r\nmethod of procedure--having reached a grand total of several thousand.\r\nHe therefore had a right to suppose that his visit would prove\r\nacceptable to the physicians of that metropolis; but the published\r\naccount of this visit reveals plainly the fact that the surgeons of\r\nthat city were not at all pleased that an itinerant lithotomist from\r\none of the provinces should have the effrontery to request permission\r\nof the authorities to exhibit his method before the Medical Faculty of\r\nParis. His request, however, was granted, and he was allowed to operate\r\non a man, forty years old, at Hôtel-Dieu. He performed the operation\r\nbefore a large assembly of physicians, and, after the stone had been\r\nsuccessfully extracted, the patient made a prompt recovery. A short\r\ntime afterward he operated upon another patient at Fontainebleau in the\r\npresence of several physicians, one of whom was Monsieur Félix, the\r\nFirst Surgeon of the King, Louis the Fourteenth. In this case also, as\r\nwell as in several later cases, Frère Jacques was entirely successful,\r\nand he now began to be treated by the public with marked consideration.\r\nBut, in a short time, owing to the jealousy exhibited by a large clique\r\nof Paris surgeons, who were encouraged to pursue this course by Mery,\r\nthe Head Surgeon of Hôtel-Dieu, Frère Jacques was finally forced to\r\nleave Paris. I cannot follow him on his further wanderings throughout\r\nEurope, from the leading cities of Holland, Belgium and Switzerland to\r\nVienna and Rome. In 1716 he retired to Besançon and lived there quietly\r\nup to the time of his death in 1719. But even then his enemies--men to\r\nwhom he had never done the slightest harm--did their best to destroy\r\nthe last traces of his existence. A visit made to Besançon by one of\r\nhis acquaintances not long after our Franciscan monk’s death, revealed\r\nthe fact that his name had been erased from the church registry of\r\ndeaths. The lateral method of operating for stone, which had been\r\nrevived and thoroughly developed by him, still finds favor among the\r\nbest surgeons of our own day; and the names of those mean-spirited men\r\nwho tried so hard to injure him have long since passed into complete\r\noblivion.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 27. JEAN BASEILHAC, COMMONLY KNOWN IN FRANCE AS\r\n  FRÈRE CÔME.\r\n\r\n  (From the steel engraving in Pascal Baseilhac’s treatise.)]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: FIG. 28. CONCEALED LITHOTOME INVENTED BY FRÈRE CÔME IN\r\n  1748.\r\n\r\n  (From the steel engraving in Pascal Baseilhac’s treatise.)]\r\n\r\n(_b_) Frère Jean de Saint-Côme,--or Brother John of Saint\r\nCosmas,--whose real name was Jean Baseilhac, was born in 1703 at\r\nPoyestruc, Department of Hautes-Pyrenées, France. He received his\r\ninstruction in the principles of medicine from his father and his\r\ngrandfather, both of whom were regularly enrolled Masters in Surgery.\r\nIn 1722, when there could no longer be any doubt about young\r\nBaseilhac’s settled purpose to fit himself for the practice of\r\nmedicine, his father sent him to Lyons, where his uncle, who was\r\nhimself a surgeon, would be able to superintend the boy’s further\r\ntraining. Through the latter’s influence, young Baseilhac was allowed\r\nto enter the Hôtel-Dieu of that city as one of its regular pupils.\r\nAt the end of two years--_i.e._, in 1724--he left Lyons and\r\nwent to Paris, where he hoped to add materially to his stock of\r\nprofessional knowledge. His first step, after reaching the metropolis,\r\nwas to enter the service of a surgeon in active practice; and then,\r\naided by the latter’s influence, he succeeded (in 1726) in entering\r\nthe Paris Hôtel-Dieu as one of the regular pupils. Soon after he\r\nhad completed his term of service at the hospital, he was appointed\r\nPhysician-in-Ordinary to the Prince-Bishop of Bayeux, in Normandy. The\r\ndeath of the latter in 1728, less than two years after Baseilhac had\r\nentered his service, came as a great blow to the young surgeon, for he\r\nhad learned to esteem him very highly. In his will the Bishop left a\r\nsmall legacy to Baseilhac--that is, a sum of money sufficient to pay\r\nfor the regular course of instruction at the Medical School of Saint\r\nCosmas in Paris, and also to procure a complete outfit of surgical\r\ninstruments. In 1740 he became a member of the Feuillants Branch of\r\nthe Franciscan monks, it being understood, however, that he was to be\r\nallowed the special privilege of practicing surgery among the poorer\r\nclasses. Through accidental circumstances he was led gradually to drop\r\ngeneral surgery and to confine his work to operations for stone. His\r\nofficial name at this time was “Frère Jean de Saint-Côme,” or simply\r\n“Frère Côme.” (Fig. 27.) As he gained in experience as a lithotomist,\r\nhe became convinced that the method which his predecessor, Frère\r\nJacques, had practiced with such great success, was preferable to the\r\nmore complicated and more dangerous plan commonly pursued by surgeons\r\nat that time, and thereafter he adopted it in all his cases. But he\r\nmodified the procedure to a certain extent; that is, he invented an\r\ninstrument by means of which the actual cutting of the perinaeum was\r\naccomplished with a concealed knife (see Fig. 28). The chief advantage\r\nto be gained by the employment of this instrument consisted--as was\r\nclaimed by Frère Jean and his nephew, Pascal Baseilhac,--in the fact\r\nthat in this way the danger of making the incision in the wrong place,\r\nor of too great length, was materially diminished.\r\n\r\nThe first patient upon whom the new instrument was tried (October 8,\r\n1748), was a dealer in lime, sixty years of age and in rather delicate\r\nhealth. In less than three weeks after the operation, he was entirely\r\ncured. Subsequently the instrument was employed in a large number of\r\ninstances, and the method was found to be most satisfactory; successful\r\nresults being obtained--on the average--in twelve out of thirteen\r\ncases, whereas the best results previously obtained by the method\r\ncommonly employed at that period was 50 per cent of cures. At a still\r\nlater date the statistics showed even better results--viz., 96 cures in\r\none group of 100 cases, and 316 cures in a second group of 330 cases.\r\n\r\nOwing to the rapidly increasing number of patients affected with stone\r\nin the bladder who wished to be operated upon by Frère Jean himself, he\r\nestablished in Paris in 1753, near the Saint Honoré gateway, a special\r\nhospital for lithotomy cases, and kept it in active service up to the\r\ntime of his death. The laboring classes, and the poor in general, were\r\nnot expected to pay any fees, and indeed money was often bestowed\r\nupon these people when they left the hospital, to enable them to\r\nreturn comfortably to their villages; those in moderate circumstances\r\nwere asked to pay only the expenses that had been incurred in their\r\nbehalf; and the well-to-do made such voluntary contributions as they\r\nthought proper toward the support of the hospital. The registers of the\r\ninstitution showed that, first and last, over one thousand operations\r\nhad been performed there, either by Frère Jean or by his nephew, Pascal\r\nBaseilhac. Our monk’s death occurred on July 8, 1781.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n           LIST OF THE MORE IMPORTANT AUTHORITIES CONSULTED\r\n\r\n\r\n   ARISTOTLE: HISTORY OF ANIMALS, translated by Richard Cresswell,\r\n   London, 1902.\r\n\r\n   ASCHOFF, L.: KURZE UEBERSICHTSTABELLE ZUR GESCHICHTE DER\r\n   MEDIZIN; forms the second part of Schwalbe’s treatise (_q.v._).\r\n\r\n   BAAS-HANDERSON: HISTORY OF MEDICINE, New York, 1910.\r\n\r\n   BASEILHAC, PASCAL: DE LA TAILLE LATÉRALE PAR LA PÉRINÉE, ET\r\n   CELLE DE L’HYPOGASTRE, OU HAUT APPAREIL, Paris, 1804.

An English translation of\r\nthe first volume (by Ernest Playfair) was published by Hodder and\r\nStoughton, of London, in 1910.\r\n\r\n[2] Book I., section 197, of Rawlinson’s translation.\r\n\r\n[3] From the statements just quoted it appears that a certain kind\r\nof bronze (an alloy of copper and tin, with the addition perhaps of\r\na little zinc) was used in Assyria, in the manufacture of surgical\r\nknives, as early as during the twenty-third century B. C. Dr.\r\nMeyer-Steineg, Professor of the History of Medicine in the University\r\nof Jena, Germany, assures the writer that knives made of this material\r\nare susceptible of being given as keen a cutting edge as are those made\r\nof the best of steel. At least one such bronze knife may be seen in the\r\ncollection of ancient surgical instruments, votive offerings, etc.,\r\nwhich he is making for the benefit of the University.\r\n\r\n[4] A Christian ecclesiastical writer who lived about the year 200 A.

Joachim, Berlin, 1890.\r\n\r\n[10] Book I., p. 96, of George Rawlinson’s translation.\r\n\r\n[11] Neuburger speaks of the growth of medical knowledge in India as a\r\ndevelopment that ran parallel with that of ancient Greece.\r\n\r\n[12] _From Neuburger._--Equally crude are their ideas respecting\r\nthe causes of disease, as shown by the following items selected from\r\nquite a long list of etiological factors: errors in diet and in the\r\nhabits of life, climatic influences, psychic factors, heredity, poison,\r\nsupernatural influences like the anger of the gods, the evil powers of\r\ndemons, etc. For purposes of diagnosis the earlier Indian physicians\r\nutilized not only inspection, palpation and auscultation, but also the\r\nsenses of taste and smell. They noted the losses and increases in the\r\nweight of the body, changes in the appearance of the skin, the tongue\r\nand the excretions, alterations in the configuration of the body, the\r\nform and other characteristics of swellings, etc. They also noted\r\nchanges in the patient’s voice, in the character of the breathing, in\r\nthe noises accompanying movements of the joints and the twistings of\r\nthe intestines. The crepitus caused by the rubbing together of the\r\nroughened ends of a fractured bone did not escape their notice. At\r\na later period, doubtless through the influence of the teachings of\r\nforeign physicians, they attached great importance to the examination\r\nof the pulse.\r\n\r\n[13] Nepenthes, believed to be opium, is the word employed in the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n[14] Aesculapius was held to be the son of Apollo, the god of medicine,\r\nand to have been instructed in the art of healing by Chiron, one of the\r\ncentaurs. Beside his famous sons, Machaon and Podalirius, he had four\r\ndaughters whose names--Hygieia, Jaso, Panakeia and Aigle--have come\r\ndown to us through the ages. His wife’s name was Epione, and those of\r\nhis two younger sons were Telesphorus and Janiscus, but all three of\r\nthese names are rarely mentioned by the Greek writers.\r\n\r\n[15] “Kranken-Anstalten im griechisch-römischen Altertum,” von Dr. med.\r\net jur. Theodor Meyer-Steineg, a. o. Professor an der Universität Jena;\r\nVerlag von G. Fischer, 1912.\r\n\r\n[16] “Kranken-Anstalten im griechisch-romischen Altertum,” in _Jenaer\r\nmedizin.-historische Beiträge_, Jena, 1912.\r\n\r\n[17] All important traces of the earlier structures seem to have\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[18] The Emperor Antoninus Pius, in order to provide properly for these\r\npatients, erected at Epidaurus a special building in which confinement\r\ncases and those likely to end fatally might be lodged.\r\n\r\n[19] The slave of Chremulos.\r\n\r\n[20] To save space the head of the god alone has been reproduced in\r\nFig. 5.\r\n\r\n[21] _Histoire de la Médecine_, Amsterdam, 1723.\r\n\r\n[22] The word “school,” when employed in the strictly modern sense of\r\nthat term, means an establishment regularly organized for the purpose\r\nof giving instruction. Here, however, it is intended to signify simply\r\nthat certain places, like Cos, Crotona, Cnidus, etc., had become\r\nthe rendezvous of men who desired to cultivate--some as teachers,\r\nothers as disciples or pupils--certain branches of knowledge, or\r\ncertain doctrines. At a later period (third century B. C.) there was\r\nestablished at Alexandria, Egypt, a well-organized school of medicine\r\nclosely resembling those of modern times.\r\n\r\n[23] All of these are translations from the French.\r\n\r\n[24] The city of Cnidus was situated very close to the Island of Cos,\r\non a peninsula that projects from the coast of Caria, Asia Minor.\r\n\r\n[25] Black bile, it was believed, comes from the spleen, while the\r\nyellow variety is a product of the liver.\r\n\r\n[26] Daremberg (_Hist. de la Méd._) makes the following comments\r\non this sentence: “How many are the occasions when we physicians would\r\nhave it in our power to avert death, or at least to postpone it for a\r\nfew hours, if we would only engrave upon our memories these words of\r\nthe old man of Cos! ‘What a cruel responsibility rests upon those whose\r\nduty it is to summon the doctor at the proper moment! And how great\r\nmust be the remorse if he fails to arrive in time!’ On the other hand,\r\nhow wise is the remark of Celsus: ‘The best practitioner is he who\r\nnever loses sight of his patients.’”\r\n\r\n[27] After Alexandria first came under Roman rule (about 30 B. C.)\r\nmembership in the Museum was granted to athletes and other men of no\r\neducation, and it is said that even before that time Ptolemy Euergetes,\r\nwho had reopened the schools during the latter part of his reign,\r\nbestowed some of the important positions upon men who were simply his\r\nfavorites. The library of the Museum was seriously damaged by fire at\r\nthe time when Julius Caesar was being besieged in Alexandria by the\r\ninhabitants of that city, and was at last wholly destroyed by Amrou,\r\nthe Lieutenant of the Caliph Omar, in A. D. 651. The truth of this\r\nextraordinary tale regarding the burning of books belonging to the\r\nlibrary at Alexandria in the seventh century is seriously doubted\r\nby Sismondi (_Histoire de la Chute de l’Empire Romain_, Vol.\r\nII., p. 57). “It was,” he says, “published for the first time, by\r\nAbulpharagius, about six centuries after the event is supposed to have\r\noccurred. And yet the contemporaneous national historians, Entychius\r\nand Elmacin, make no mention of it whatever. An act of this nature,\r\nfurthermore, would be in direct conflict with the precepts of the\r\nKoran and with the profound respect which the Mohammedans habitually\r\nentertain for every scrap of paper on which the name of God happens to\r\nbe written.”\r\n\r\nUnder the later rule of the Romans, Alexandria regained a good deal of\r\nits literary importance and also became a chief seat of Christianity\r\nand theological learning; but as a centre of medical influence its\r\nglory had long since departed.\r\n\r\n[28] Asclepiades was not a descendant of Aesculapius, as one would\r\nnaturally infer from the name which he bore.\r\n\r\n[29] It would not be easy to fix, even approximately, the date\r\nwhen remedies of this character ceased to find acceptance in the\r\npopular mind of Europeans, but there can be no doubt that they were\r\nemployed rather frequently even as late as during the eighteenth\r\ncentury;--indeed, measures that strongly smack of superstition are now\r\nand then looked upon with favor by the well-educated members of our\r\nmodern society. For many centuries, however, they have been abandoned\r\nby all physicians excepting those who are unworthy to bear that honored\r\ntitle.\r\n\r\n[30] Neither Haller nor Dezeimeris furnishes any biographical\r\ninformation with regard to Musa.\r\n\r\n[31] Antoninus Pius, however, established the rule that these\r\nprivileges were not to be granted to all physicians indiscriminately,\r\nbut only to a limited number; and, later still, it was decided that\r\nonly the parish physicians were entitled to receive them.\r\n\r\n[32] It seems almost unnecessary to call attention to the fact that the\r\nsubject of these remarks is not to be confounded with Thessalus, the\r\nson of Hippocrates.\r\n\r\n[33] Ἰατρονίκης is the word employed in the original Greek.\r\n\r\n[34] The word “metasyncrisis,” as we are assured by Le Clerc, was\r\nemployed first by Cassius, one of the earlier disciples of Methodism,\r\nand then, long after the time of Thessalus, by Galen, Oribasius, Aëtius\r\nand Paulus Aegineta.\r\n\r\n[35] Le Clerc calls attention to the incorrectness--etymologically\r\nspeaking--of the use of the word “Eclectics” in connection with a\r\nschool or sect. The members of such a body are not, he says, “the\r\nchosen ones” as the term signifies, but “the choosers.”\r\n\r\n[36] Boerhaave, the famous clinician of Leyden, Holland (eighteenth\r\ncentury), was instrumental in having an excellent Latin translation\r\nmade of this work; and in 1858 a German translation by A. Mann was\r\npublished in Halle.\r\n\r\n[37] Translated from _Oeuvres de Rufus d’Éphèse_; édition Grecque\r\net Française, par Daremberg et Ruelle, Paris, 1879.\r\n\r\n[38] The term “dogmatists” is also employed by some authorities to\r\ndesignate those physicians who laid great stress upon the importance of\r\nfollowing the teachings of Hippocrates and Galen.\r\n\r\n[39] The majority of the writings of Galen are reported to have been\r\nkept, for safe preservation, in the Temple of Peace, near the Forum;\r\nand the destruction of this building by fire, during the latter half of\r\nthe second century, entailed the loss of all these valuable works.\r\n\r\n[40] Book VI., Chapter XVII. (page 441 of Vol. I. of Daremberg’s\r\nversion).\r\n\r\n[41] In his Commentaries on the works of Hippocrates (Epidemic\r\nDiseases, III., t. XVII. B. § 4) Galen states that he has often\r\nobserved this to-and-fro movement of the alae nasi in certain cases of\r\nillness and that he has interpreted it as indicating the existence of\r\nsome serious disorder of the respiratory tract. (Daremberg.)\r\n\r\n[42] Hippocrates, Herophilus, Erasistratus, Asclepiades, Themison,\r\nCelsus, Soranus and Athenaeus. Daremberg calls attention to the fact\r\nthat, although we possess to-day only a few fragments of the writings\r\nof Archigenes, those few are of such a degree of excellence that we may\r\nwell ask ourselves whether Galen was not perfectly justified in placing\r\nsuch a high estimate as he appears to have done upon the merits of this\r\nwriter,--and that, too, notwithstanding the unfavorable criticism which\r\nhe makes in the present paragraph about the author’s failure at times\r\nto write with sufficient clearness on medical subjects.\r\n\r\n[43] John the Grammarian, whose nativity is not stated by Le Clerc, was\r\nat first a simple boatman who ferried back and forth those who attended\r\na school which was located on one of the islands at Alexandria. As a\r\nresult of his frequent talks with these men, he became enamored with\r\nphilosophy and decided, notwithstanding his age (forty years), to\r\ndevote himself entirely to the study of the subject. Accordingly, he\r\nsold his boat and attended the lectures regularly, becoming at last\r\nan expert in philosophy. He wrote several important treatises and\r\ncommentaries, some of them dealing with medical topics, and he also\r\nmade a number of translations from the Greek into Arabic.\r\n\r\n[44] Third edition, London, 1726.\r\n\r\n[45] Anthemius is also credited with being the inventor of the\r\nprinciple of dome construction in architecture.\r\n\r\n[46] Also written Paulus Aeginetes.\r\n\r\n[47] The account which is given in this and the following chapters\r\nis based largely on Dr. Lucien Le Clerc’s _Histoire de la Médecine\r\nArabe_, Paris, 1876.\r\n\r\n[48] Le Clerc and Freind mention both Nishapur and Djondisabour as the\r\nname of the capital of the Province of Khorassan in northeast Persia.\r\n\r\n[49] The drachma was a silver coin worth about 9¾ pence English money.\r\nThe fee paid to Gabriel for his surgical services amounted, therefore,\r\nto a little less than £2000 or $10,000.\r\n\r\n[50] To distinguish him from Mesué the Younger, who lived at Cairo,\r\nEgypt, about one hundred years later, and who attained considerable\r\ncelebrity on account of the treatises which he wrote on materia medica.\r\n\r\n[51] For further remarks concerning the origin of the Teïssir see page\r\n229.\r\n\r\n[52] According to tradition the medical school at Salerno was founded\r\nby four physicians--Adela, an Arab; Helinus, a Jew; Pontus, a Greek;\r\nand Salernus, a Latin.\r\n\r\n[53] Perhaps the French title “sage-femme” originated from this.\r\n\r\n[54] There can be no question, says Neuburger (in agreement with\r\nDaremberg), about the truth of the statement that Constantinus\r\nallowed the authorship of several of the treatises issued at Salerno\r\nunder his name to be attributed to himself--as, for example, the\r\n“_Liber Pantegni_” (_Pantechni_), which is in reality the\r\n“_Liber Regalis_” of Haly Abbas; the “_Pieticum_,” which is\r\nfundamentally the work of Ibn-al-Dschezzar; the “_De Oculis_,”\r\nwhich is based upon Honein ben Ischak’s treatise on opthalmology; and\r\nstill other works which it is not necessary to specify.\r\n\r\n[55] Under the heading “_Epilogus_” on pages 268 and 269 of Meaux\r\nSaint-Marc’s version.\r\n\r\n[56] Examples of leonine versification: “Contra vim _mortis_,\r\nnulla est herba in _hortis_”; (p. 155 of Saint-Marc’s version) and\r\n(from Shelley’s _Cloud_) “I am the _daughter_ of the earth\r\nand _water_.”\r\n\r\n[57] The term “praepositus” means the president or the dean of the\r\nschool with which the person named is connected.\r\n\r\n[58] The Opus majus, ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897 (2d edition,\r\n1900); opera hactenus inedita, ed. B. Steele, Fasc. I., London.\r\n\r\n[59] Aurei. The aureus is said to have been worth about 16 shillings,\r\nEnglish money.\r\n\r\n[60] A church official to whom was intrusted the duty of granting\r\ndispensations; “Almoner” is perhaps the equivalent term in English.\r\n\r\n[61] “Non enim est necesse saniem--sicut Rogerius et Rolandus\r\nscripserunt et plerique eorum discipuli docent, et fere omnes cururgici\r\nmoderni servant--in vulneribus generare. Iste enim error est major quam\r\npotest esse. Non est enim aliud, nisi impedire naturam, prolongare\r\nmorbum, prohibere conglutinationem et consolidationem vulneris.” (II.,\r\ncap. 27.)\r\n\r\n[62] The most recent edition of this work is a French translation made\r\nby P. Pifteau and published at Toulouse, in 1898.\r\n\r\n[63] According to Daremberg (_Histoire des Sciences Médicales_,\r\nVol. I., p. 264) the title “Doctor” appears for the first time in the\r\nPreface of Roger’s treatise (1180 A. D.).\r\n\r\n[64] “_La Grande Chirurgie de Guy de Chauliac_,” Paris, 1890.\r\n\r\n[65] The distinguishing sign of the barbers was the shaving dish, made\r\nof _pewter_ and hung up at the door of the shop; that employed by\r\nthe surgeons was also a shaving dish, but made of polished brass. Those\r\nsurgeons who had received their training at the school of Saint Cosmas\r\nand Saint Damian were permitted to display at the window a banner\r\nbearing the coat of arms of this institution.\r\n\r\n[66] The surgeons Cosmas and Damian were chosen patron saints of the\r\nnew organization. They were born in Arabia in the third century, and\r\nare said to have been educated there. After having practiced medicine\r\nfor a certain length of time in Sicily, they were tortured and killed,\r\nbecause of their Christian faith, by order of the Emperor Diocletian,\r\n303 A. D. Hence the title “Saints.”\r\n\r\n[67] Guy de Chauliac, who wrote a treatise on surgery in the latter\r\nhalf of the fourteenth century, also speaks of the value of this\r\ndiagnostic sign.\r\n\r\n[68] See remarks on the subject of amulets, etc., on pages 197, 198.\r\n\r\n[69] A small town in the Department of Lot, France. The earliest Norman\r\nancestors of the Gurdon family in England are said to have derived\r\ntheir name from that of this town.\r\n\r\n[70] Introduction to the “Oeuvres d’Ambroise Paré,” Paris, 1840.\r\n\r\n[71] “Gaddesden had for a long time been troubled how to cure stone:\r\n‘At last,’ says he, in his _Rosa Anglica_, ‘I thought of\r\ncollecting a good quantity of those beetles which in summer are found\r\nin the dung of oxen, also of the crickets which sing in the fields. I\r\ncut off the heads and the wings of the crickets and put them with the\r\nbeetles and common oil into a pot; I covered it and left it afterwards\r\nfor a day and night in a bread oven. I drew out the pot and heated it\r\nat a moderate fire, I pounded the whole and rubbed the sick parts;\r\nin three days the pain had disappeared;’ under the influence of the\r\nbeetles and the crickets the stone was broken into bits. It was almost\r\nalways thus, by a sudden illumination, that this doctor discovered his\r\nmost efficacious remedies: Madame Trote [Trotula] of Salerno never\r\nconfided to her agents in various parts of the world the secret of more\r\nmarvelous and unexpected recipes.” (From Jusserand’s “English Wayfaring\r\nLife in the Middle Ages.”)\r\n\r\n[72] Some weeks later our fellow voyager, Thomas Schoepfius, wrote\r\nto me that, on the return journey, he learned at Berne that “Long\r\nPeter,” the leader of the Mézières robbers, had been apprehended by the\r\nauthorities and executed for his crimes; and that, when stretched on\r\nthe rack, he had confessed, among other things, that he had tried to\r\nmurder and rob some students who passed through Mézières on their way\r\nto Lausanne.\r\n\r\n[73] Also often spelled “Falloppius.”\r\n\r\n[74] The meaning of this Latin inscription can best be appreciated by\r\nthose physicians who have, through a long period of years, practiced\r\ntheir profession largely among the well-to-do classes of a metropolitan\r\ncity. They alone, I believe, would understand the significance of\r\n“_lucrum neglectum_” as applied to a large proportion of the gifts\r\nwhich a practitioner of medicine receives from grateful patients; and\r\nit is not at all likely that a layman who is not familiar with this\r\naspect of a physician’s life would, under the circumstances mentioned,\r\nhave the slightest suspicion that the device quoted above could\r\npossibly bear the meaning that I have given to it.\r\n\r\n[75] See F. Loeffler: “Vorlesungen uber die geschichtliche Entwickelung\r\nder Lehre von den Bakterien,” Leipzig, 1887, Th. 1; and also p. 310 of\r\nPuschmann’s “Geschichte des Medicinischen Unterrichts,” Leipzig, 1889.\r\n\r\n[76] The iatrophysicists and the iatromathematicians constituted\r\napparently two kindred branches of the same school.\r\n\r\n[77] An edition of the completed set of these plates was published by\r\nLancisi at Rome in 1714.\r\n\r\n[78] Translated from the French version printed by Daremberg in his\r\n_Histoire de la Médecine_, Vol. II, p. 706. The originals of\r\nSydenham’s writings are all in Latin.\r\n\r\n[79] Pronounced by Haeser to be a compilation, and not one of\r\nSydenham’s genuine writings.\r\n\r\n[80] Physicians who maintain that all physiological and pathological\r\nphenomena may be explained by the laws of physics.\r\n\r\n[81] “Gründliches Bedenken und physicalische Anmerkungen von dem\r\ntödtlichen Damff der Holzkohlen,” Halle, 1716.\r\n\r\n[82] Probably this refers simply to a brazier containing burning\r\ncharcoal, the light emitted by which would doubtless be sufficient to\r\nanswer the purpose of a night lamp.\r\n\r\n[83] A small seaport town located on the Zuider Zee, about thirty miles\r\nnortheast of Amsterdam. The university, which was founded there in\r\n1648, was abandoned in 1818.\r\n\r\n[84] Quoted from the English translation mentioned above.\r\n\r\n[85] Bread boiled in water to the consistence of pulp.\r\n\r\n[86] The modern operation known as litholapaxy.\r\n\r\n[87] The word “_centuria_” is employed here in the sense of “a\r\ngroup of one hundred.”\r\n\r\n[88] Not Amatus, but a specialist. See remark near the top of page 488.\r\n\r\n[89] Orange, which is only a short distance from Avignon and Turriers,\r\nwas ceded to France in 1713.\r\n\r\n[90] In the absence of a more fitting place in which to speak of the\r\nemployment of urethral bougies, it seems permissible to state here that\r\nthe first mention (in medical literature) of these instruments occurs\r\nin Chapter XV. of the treatise of Guainerio, Professor of Medicine at\r\nthe University of Pavia. This work, which was first published in 1439,\r\nbears the title: “_Practica Antonii Guainerii_,” and a later\r\nedition was issued at Venice in 1508. Speaking of a case of stone in\r\nthe bladder, Guainerius says: “And if the urine does not flow from the\r\nbladder ... introduce a slender flexible rod of tin or silver into the\r\nurethra.”\r\n\r\n[91] Franco calls it the “high operation” or “hypogastric lithotomy.”\r\n\r\n[92] After I had written the preceding description of Franco’s new\r\nmethod of extracting a calculus from the urinary bladder, I learned,\r\nfrom Haeser’s account of the surgical writings of Susrutas in the\r\nAyur-Veda (Sanscrit), that already before the Christian era (the\r\nexact date is not known) the surgeons of East India had performed\r\nthis very operation. This fact, however, could not possibly have been\r\nknown to Franco, who--so far as modern surgeons are concerned--should\r\ncontinue to be looked upon as the real inventor of suprapubic\r\ncystotomy.--AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n[93] The fact that bullets are not hot when they inflict a wound was\r\nproven experimentally by Bartolommeo Maggi several years earlier, but\r\nParé makes no reference to this fact.\r\n\r\n[94] Johann Jacob Wecker (1528–1586), born at Basel, Switzerland, and\r\nauthor of a treatise entitled “_Practica medicinae generalis_”\r\n(Basel, 1585).\r\n\r\n[95] In this instance I have thought it best to modernize the spelling\r\nof several of the words.\r\n\r\n[96] Not healing in a healthy manner.\r\n\r\n[97] Driving back.\r\n\r\n[98] Haeser speaks of Wiseman as having gained considerable distinction\r\nby the careful manner in which he made provision for the flaps in his\r\namputations.\r\n\r\n[99] “_Observations diverses sur la stérilité, etc._,” Paris, 1609.\r\n\r\n[100] For a confirmation of this statement see the poem on syphilis\r\n(“_Enfermedad de las Bubas_”) written by the Spanish physician\r\nFrancesco Lopez de Villalobos and published by him in 1498 at\r\nSalamanca. The employment of mercurial inunctions is also mentioned in\r\nthis poem.\r\n\r\n[101] Physicians who had served at Rome as the regular medical\r\nattendants of Pope Alexander the Sixth.\r\n\r\n[102] “Die Geschichte der venerischen Krankheiten,” Bonn, 1895.\r\n\r\n[103] “Zur Geschichte der Syphilis,” Breslau, 1870.\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n1.
